<p>“Beautiful Place in My Heart: crown jewel Earth”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Have you ever been away from a familiar place for a  time— say, a year, or even a week— and then come back and expect  that everything has drastically changed? In reality, everything has  gotten along perfectly well without you, and whatever changes <em>have</em> been made are easy to adjust to. This is what the handful of natives  felt when they returned to their Earth: both anxious to see what had  transpired in the few months since they left, and eager for news  concerning these changes. Of course, a few months is nothing compared  to thirty years— or fifty— or six-hundred.</p>
<p>Earth’s greatest recent change happened about two  generations ago, during the final years of her last war. Countries  were already obsolete and barriers had been erased in favor of  “regions”, such as the African region, the Middle Eastern region,  the Russian, and so on. Diehard still kept some of the old names  (like Riene), but most people had adjusted to the change easily  enough. But it was not names or boundaries that brought about the  last war: strife between the present ruling class and a small but  significant rebel faction had stirred the embers of discontent into  all-out conflict which spread across the globe and threatened to  throw humanity into permanent ruin. The war had ended well, though,  or as well as a war can end, and now the <em>Pax Terran</em> governed  the livelihoods of Earth citizens. All that had happened fifty years  ago or so, and as such, there were very few survivors.</p>
<p>But the peace had lasted, and so for the past  half-century, not a single major conflict had risen up. The people  were too afraid of war, and were constantly reminded of its  consequences as they went about their lives: the previous generation  insisted that many of the ruins remain as monuments to discourage  further fighting. Twenty-five years after the last shot was fired and  the treaty was signed— three decades ago by modern reckoning—  Earth finally decided to take its space exploration seriously, and  proposed the creation of twenty-six exploration “Squads” to  search the heavens. Perhaps the absence of war inspired humanity to  invest its energies toward a higher calling, or maybe the advent of  the plant-based Hyperion drive, given to Earth by benevolent alien  life, was the catalyst they needed. Either way, they had finally  climbed out of their cradle and joined the stars; one of its citizens  had even been promoted to director of the United cosmic Military, an  unprecedented feat.</p>
<p>Of course, now that Earth was investing more of its  time and energy into space, its population had changed drastically.  There were fewer people on Earth now, more space and more resources  to share, and their social structure had changed to inspire the Group  Dynamic instead of individual achievements. “Aliens” were also  part of the population as well— not just Merovians, Mer-folk, and  the Quercus, as it had been in the beginning, but a vast number of  other races and species, no longer making Earth a place solely for  humans. Naturally, there were xenophobes, racists, separatists, and  extremists of all kinds, but the majority welcomed the outsiders,  coexisting and even cohabitating (half-breeds were not as uncommon as  one would think). Perhaps this unity, the lengthy absence of war, and  the returning abundance of natural resources was responsible for the  UCM nominating a woman from Earth, but Astor had a good personal  record as well, and seemed like a natural choice.</p>
<p>Now that the <em>Dauntless</em> had arrived, her crew was  split on what to visit first. Most of the women merely wanted to tour  the world and search for treasure, but a few had very specific goals.</p>
<p>“I’d like to follow Marsa on her journey,” Alala  said.</p>
<p>“And wherever you’re going, I’m coming along,”  Yenae smiled.</p>
<p>“I’d like for all of us to go,” Allegra said,  “but I also wanna stop on by and see the young’uns, if I can.”</p>
<p>“Sharyn and I are going to the European region to  search for the last of those relics,” Lyara said.</p>
<p>“Aye, and how befitting it should be hid on ‘the  Emerald Isle’!” she grinned.</p>
<p>“Drop me off in Naples, Italy while you’re there,”  Riene asked. Kay and Tee yanked on their hair, confused by all the  requests.</p>
<p>“One at a time, one at a time!! First let’s figure  out where we are.”</p>
<p>“Looks like the ocean,” Eve said as she peered out  one of the observation windows. “You got me on which one, though.  Hey, if ya could, could ya please try and avoid Washington, DC? My  old man lives there and I’d rather not get within range of that rat  bastard.”</p>
<p>“It’s the Atlantic,” Kay murmured as she checked  their coordinates. “We’ll be over Africa soon, so I guess Italy’s  our first stop.”</p>
<p>“Do you just want us to drop you off at the closest  spaceport?” Tee said to Riene.</p>
<p>“Yes, if you don’t mind. I can just take a taxi the  rest of the way.”</p>
<p>“How long do you think you’ll be?” she smiled and  pulled out her phone.</p>
<p>“I’ll call you when I’m finished. Really, don’t  bother waiting up. I’ll catch up later.” The twins shrugged and  opened up a channel so they could get landing clearance.</p>
<p>“It’s your decision.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Oh, they’re almost finished.”</p>
<p>The very first thing Riene noticed as she emerged from  the spaceport was that the construction project that was halfway  finished when she left the Earth was now almost complete. There was  still a mobile suit overseeing the finishing stages, but the building  looked ready for business. Little touches like this are what make a  journey most endearing: you realize what has changed since you left,  and what has not. She smiled fondly and hailed a taxi.</p>
<p>“Naples, please.” Cab fare had gone up a little,  too, but Riene had plenty of money. None of her companions knew it,  but the Latoli family was quite wealthy, and some people said they  controlled most of Italy and had been in charge ever since the Mafia  had died out. Her ancestors had been so wealthy that her father could  literally spend his whole life without working and have enough for  his grandchildren to share the same privilege— but of course this  didn’t happen, and as far as she knew, he was still at the daily  grind, and mother as well, and perhaps a few of her siblings were  being groomed to take over. Riene had a classical Italian family—  large, proud, close-knit, and very traditional— and it came with  its share of blessings and curses.</p>
<p>The taxi took her as far as a Tran station and she left  the driver a tip for his efforts. No cabs came close to the Latoli  estate, so she had to take public transportation and then walk or get  a ride the rest of the way. Riene hesitated, though, as the first  Tran came by. Why was she in such a hurry? Was she so determined to  “get it over with” that she’d rush headlong into it and boldly  stare down anything in her way? That wasn’t who she was, and she  knew it. Even at her best, Riene Latoli was a little spineless: a  meek, insecure, doubtful, spoiled woman yearning for someone strong  to take care of all her problems for her. She had very little courage  except in diplomacy, and very little stomach for offending others; as  such, she had been labeled as something of a doormat in school. In  spite of her good grades and clean record, nobody really respected  her, and her family saw her as something of a black sheep who would  one day turn into a doddering old maid unless she got her act  together. They were right, of course, but…</p>
<p>Something sparked inside her soul that was determined  to lead her own life, in her own way. Unfortunately, this inner  dialogue caused her to miss the Tran, but that was probably for the  best. The old Riene, the doormat, would have rushed to make it there  as soon as possible and would’ve endured their barbs with the same  quiet grace and dignity she always carried. Today she would explore  the city and really get to know Naples for what it was. She would  procrastinate and enjoy it, and if her family raised a stink, nuts to  them!</p>
<p>Her stroll led her down charming suburban streets,  where familiar stores, schools, parks, and gardens blossomed out of  the background to greet her. A few of the pedestrians even recognized  her, and smiled or waved, though none of them approached her, too  afraid to shatter the social barriers. Riene slipped into a  restaurant for lunch and ordered something she had never eaten  before; she even asked for dessert. She played some hopscotch with a  group of children and perused a bookstore for the trashiest romances  she could find. Her face was bright red when she purchased some  lesbian erotica, but she also felt exhilarated and even liberated as  she walked outside (remembering to tuck her prize in a safe spot so  that her family would not discover it). She spent half the day  finding a secluded place to read her book, and the rest of it  immersed in her tale. Her heart caught in her throat the more she  read, but she couldn’t turn away either. It was early evening by  the time she caught a Tran, and getting dark when she walked the rest  of the way to her family’s estate. If she had timed it right, she  would hopefully arrive just after dinner, when her folks would be too  fat and sated to bother her.</p>
<p>The Latoli estate had been bought back when Europe  still had countries, and had a long and rich history behind it. It  had been an Imperial stronghold during the last conflict, and had  played an important part in reviving European welfare in the  aftermath. Riene’s grandfather insisted on investing his stock “on  the planet and not in space” (in his own words), and this turned  out to be a wise move when Hyperion plants were introduced. The  Italian climate was particularly healthy for them and so he made a  bundle on top of his initial inheritance. Riene’s father took over  the business and now Hyperion was being used for standard planetary  transport and fuel; it was the best source of renewable energy since  Heliotrope crystals, which had been all the rage during the war.</p>
<p>The estate proper was surrounded by a veritable forest:  a greenhouse, several gardens and arbors, a fountain, a scenic  walking trail, an outdoor pool, and a small barn that held the  lawnmower and various tools. The Latolis had never had servants,  since they believed “if you can do the job yourself, you should”,  and Riene remembered sharing the workload with her many siblings. She  approached the estate from the side and immediately heard loud,  bombastic conversation and laughing. How could such a joyous noise  put such a large pit in her stomach?— yet she knew her family had  probably just sat down to dinner, and she had miscalculated her  arrival. There was nothing for it, though: she had came all this way  so it was better to get it over with. Riene firmly opened the door  and stepped inside.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Her arrival was greeted by an arresting silence.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Uh…I’m home,” she announced softly.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>It was her mother who spoke first. “Oh, Riene!” She  got up from the table and padded over to her prodigal daughter,  half-holding and half-caressing her, as if she were a vague dream  that needed time to be recalled. “Why didn’t you tell us you had  arrived? I would’ve sent someone out to get you! Oh, you look so  thin! Haven’t you been eating?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, mother,” she said, attempting to  smile. “I just felt like taking a look around.”</p>
<p>“You should’ve called your mother and told her you  were here,” her father grumbled, more focused on his meal than his  daughter. “Jumping in out of the blue isn’t polite.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and sit down; you’re just in time for  supper!” called one of her brothers. “Mama cooked especially for  you, so stop being ungrateful and dig in!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, gonna need to put some meat on your bones!”  another shouted.</p>
<p>“You never were much more than a beanpole, Ree,”  grinned one of her sisters. Riene felt the quiet grace and dignity  approaching, and absorbed their barbs patiently. She had four  brothers: Dominic, Niccolo, Lorenzo, and Stefan; and she had three  sisters: Antoinette, Gabriella, and Mireille; of the eight, she was  somewhere in the lower half in terms of age, a middle child amidst a  throng of middle children, a face lost in a crowd of other Latolis,  of no more concern or merit to her folks than any of their other  children: just another Jane or Mary, albeit one of their own. There  was also a team of husbands and wives present as well; all of the  children were presumably in another room, or else at home. The main  dining room was large enough to hold this immense clan, yet the only  seat available was between Dominic and Gabriella, the siblings she  had the loosest bonds with. Riene knew that all eyes were upon her as  she sheepishly took her place.</p>
<p>“So tell us again where you’re been all this time,”  Stefan demanded. “It’s been a few years since you’ve left  university. Are you a teacher now, or what?”</p>
<p>“No, she said she’d be traveling somewhere,”  Antoinette corrected. “Was it to another country, Ree? I know you  studied languages so you could be an interpreter.”</p>
<p>“I actually went into space,” she replied meekly.</p>
<p>“What <em>for</em>?” her father wondered.</p>
<p>“To find myself,” she answered profoundly. The  implications were lost on this bunch. Some even laughed.</p>
<p>“<em>Find</em> yourself? You’re right here, Riene.  You already know who you are and where you come from— what more do  you need?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I meant, daddy. I just wanted to  push myself, to experience something different.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do anything so extravagant for  that,” Niccolo pointed.</p>
<p>“It was probably some guy,” Gabriella snickered.  Dominic chortled.</p>
<p>“Ha! That’s likely! She never had a boyfriend here,  so she went looking for one in outer space!”</p>
<p>“So are we going to have an alien for an in-law?”  Mireille teased.</p>
<p>“How about a half-breed for a niece or nephew?  Wouldn’t that be rich, dad?”</p>
<p>“I don’t <em>have</em> a boyfriend,” Riene  insisted, although her words fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>“You’d better not fall in love with something that  isn’t even human,” Father grumbled.</p>
<p>“Dear, if she loves him, what does it matter?”  Mother said.</p>
<p>“Riene, <em>are</em> you in love?” Lorenzo asked.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I went away for,” she declared.  She couldn’t bring herself to tell them the truth. Her mother  smiled and raised her glass at her.</p>
<p>“Well, whatever brought you away, you’re back now  and that’s what’s important.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, so tell us what space is like!” Stefan  grinned. Riene tried answering him, but she was completely drowned  out by the burbling din her family always created when they got  together. It became impossible to distinguish one conversation from  the next, and so she gave up and was forgotten, lost once again in  the crowd.</p>
<p>“I wanna know about that last deal you made.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was harder than I thought it’d be, and at  first, I didn’t think being persistent was enough!”</p>
<p>“So when’s the baby due?”</p>
<p>“In another four months or so. The doctor says it’s  going to be a healthy boy. How’s your girl?”</p>
<p>“She made the honor roll! We’re very proud of her.  We’re thinking about putting her in the band.”</p>
<p>“I mean, could you believe it? I certainly can’t.  He seemed like such a reliable guy, too.”</p>
<p>“I woulda slapped that no-good ratfink and kicked him  to the curb. Hey ma, could ya pass the wine? We’re getting  thirsty!”</p>
<p>“There’s plenty for you all,” she said. “Make  sure your sister gets some. Riene, would you like some wine?”</p>
<p>“A little bit, please,” she shouted. Dominic  elbowed her and started giggling.</p>
<p>“Seriously, so how’s it like? Any little green  men?”</p>
<p>“I am well-acquainted with a green-skinned woman, if  that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p>“Crazy!” he laughed, already a little tipsy. “What  else? Have you been on many worlds? Are there any like Earth?”</p>
<p>“A few,” she attempted, picking at her food. Riene  had a big lunch and wasn’t in the mood for her mother’s cooking,  regardless of how much effort she put into it (or how much the family  insisted she start eating).</p>
<p>“Eat up, dear,” Gabriella said. “You’ll never  get a boyfriend looking that skinny.”</p>
<p>“I’ve actually gained some weight during my  travels. I have some muscle now, believe it or not.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you know that there are two things men dislike  in women? A strong mind and too many muscles. Maybe that’s why you  never got married.”</p>
<p>“I’m just not interested yet,” she half-lied.</p>
<p>“You do look much healthier than you used to,” her  father admitted. “It’s good that you’re getting lots of  exercise. I trust my, uh…special training’s paying off?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, every now and then. It gets a little  dangerous sometimes, so having a firearm helps.”</p>
<p>“Oh gracious!” her mother exclaimed, fretfully  crossing herself.</p>
<p>“Now I <em>really</em> have to know what line of work  you’re in!” Antoinette said.</p>
<p>“I’m just traveling right now,” Riene murmured  bashfully. “I’m seeing places and making friends.”</p>
<p>“Friends? You?! How many?” Riene thought about that  for a moment. She couldn’t possibly describe everyone aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> as a friend, but…</p>
<p>“Oh…some fifteen or so people. There are a few  ladies from Earth with us.”</p>
<p>“Any guys?” Mireille grinned. Riene smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“No, just us women.”</p>
<p>“Boo-ring,” she sang, returning to her meal.</p>
<p>“So is this a…company that visits other worlds?  Like a diplomatic thing?” her mother attempted.</p>
<p>“Not exactly.”</p>
<p>“Sounds more like something from that ancient <em>Star  Trek</em> show,” Niccolo muttered. Riene smirked; he was closer to  the truth than he imagined.</p>
<p>“Sort of. I’m never lacking for good company, and  sometimes I’m paid for my services.”</p>
<p>“Sometimes? Ree, you might be a doormat and an old  maid, but you’re not a sucker.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, don’t you have a reliable income?”</p>
<p>“We just take what we can,” she murmured. “Don’t  worry, all my needs are— ”</p>
<p>“So you’re mercenaries!” Stefan exclaimed. Mother  put her utensils down forcefully and crossed herself.</p>
<p>“Sweet Mary and holy Lord Jesus, don’t tell me my  daughter’s gotten mixed up with a bunch of hooligans!”</p>
<p>“(At least it’s a nice way to meet men,)” Dominic  joked.</p>
<p>“No, mother! They’re all good people! Well, most of  them. I told you they’re my friends.”</p>
<p>“But still, <em>mercenaries</em>! Augh!! Why can’t  you just quit this childish behavior and settle down with a nice man,  huh? It would give me so much peace of mind.”</p>
<p>“I agree!” Niccolo said. “We actually brought a  friend of ours over here a little while ago and were going to  introduce you, but you took so long getting here that he ran off!”</p>
<p>“Maybe that’s not what she wants,” Lorenzo said.</p>
<p>“But what about what she <em>needs</em>?”</p>
<p>“Mother,” he said calmly, “not once has any of us  ever asked what Riene really wants with her life.”</p>
<p>“Probably because she herself barely knows— or <em>knew</em>,” Antoinette shrugged. Father cleared his throat and  tapped his fork on a wine glass.</p>
<p>“All right, that’s enough. It’s time to change  the subject. Gabriella, have you decided on a name for the baby yet?”</p>
<p>“No, papa, and for the last time, I’m not naming  him Christophe, Jr.”</p>
<p>“It’s a good name,” he grumbled. “Please  consider it.”</p>
<p>“(But really,)” Dominic whispered to Riene, “(think  about it. Our friend’s very nice and quite the looker. He’s not  very rich, but you couldn’t ask for a better man. Give him a chance  at least!)” Riene smiled feebly but could no longer bring herself  to interact with these people. Finally, she excused herself from the  table on the pretense that she wasn’t feeling well and wanted some  fresh air— but the truth was that she just couldn’t take it  anymore.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Riene sighed deeply as she distanced herself from the  noise, the stares, the rumors, and the presumptions of her stupid but  well-meaning family. Everything that once defined her as a person was  silenced now, and she was left in isolation— lonely but now much  happier. She hadn’t realized how much they suffocated her, and how  wise her decision to leave them was, until she returned and got a  good look at them with more experienced eyes. As she sat down on the  porch and admired the stars, the door behind her opened and a welcome  sight smiled down at her.</p>
<p>“I managed to swipe something for you.” It was  Lorenzo, the brother closest to her age and the only person on Earth  Riene could confide in. He had been silent through most of the  dinner; he knew better than to draw attention to himself. He  empathized with his sister greatly and have her a beautiful, sad,  understanding smile.</p>
<p>“Oh, Lorenzo, thank you! I needed that.” He  presented her with a glass of beer and a plate full of snacks, then  sat down next to her. Riene drained a third of the glass before  sighing with relief and speaking again. “They haven’t changed one  bit, have they?”</p>
<p>“No, not a single one. They’re older, crankier,  fatter, and more complacent than before, of course, but other than  that… So just how <em>have</em> you been, Ree?” They both knew the  answer she told him would not be the same one she told the rest of  the family. Now at last, she could be frank.</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, a little flustered. I was also,  as expected, pretty nervous about coming here. I almost didn’t make  it. All the experiences I’ve had since I left have really distanced  me from this place. Sometimes I felt like I was in over my head, and  I was challenged beyond my capabilities. I’ve seen very horrible  things, and very beautiful things as well. I’ve made lots of  friends but I’m not what you would call <em>close</em> to any of  them— not as close as I’d like. Sometimes I just feel useless.  And how are you?”</p>
<p>“Busy,” he grumbled, staring mindlessly at the inky  horizon, “and not very content. But I’ve chosen this path and  there’s no room for me to turn around in. My, uh…wife and I are  thinking about adopting.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s good news! So…you’ve grown  accustomed to each other?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She’s more like a friend I live with all the  time, and I do love her, but…well, you know, mom and dad really  needed me to step up, and at the time, I couldn’t say no. Have you  found…anyone you could see yourself living with?”</p>
<p>“I have,” she replied serenely, “though it’s  taken a lot of work and a lot of strife for me to come to that  realization. I truly do love her.” Lorenzo smiled warmly. They were  so close that she could even reveal That, and not feel shamed.</p>
<p>“You know, when you told me you’d sign up for Dr.  Miracle’s expedition, I couldn’t believe it. You were the very  last person I ever expected to take a leap of faith like that!”</p>
<p>“Am I really so pathetic?” she grinned. He smiled  and nudged closer.</p>
<p>“No. But you used to be more reserved and unsure of  yourself. You were so close to going through with that last arranged  marriage that I thought we’d be in the same damned boat. And yet  here you are, a seasoned traveler, come back to show the family what  living one’s dreams looks like. I know I asked this before, Riene,  but I’m going to say it again. Do you feel like you’re making the  right choice?”</p>
<p>She smiled lovingly at her brother and sipped half her  drink down.</p>
<p>“I know it sounds conceited, but I was never really  sure until somebody needed me. Once I had that, everything became  clear. Oh— it was the same with you, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm.” And even though he said he was relatively  happy, Riene knew that Lorenzo regretted his marriage and his life.  Something good still came out of his sacrifice, of course, but  perhaps what he gave up was greater than what he received. The look  in his eyes said it all: I came back, and now, I can’t ever <em>go </em>back. She drew a very deep breath and leaned against him.</p>
<p>“It is kind of odd when you think about it,” she  murmured. “The meekest of the bunch gets to have all these  adventures, and all the boisterous people are stuck in a daily grind.  We always get caught up in the situation we least expect ourselves to  be in, don’t we?”</p>
<p>“Ain’t that the truth, sister,” he whispered,  putting his arm around her.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Since it was too late to go anywhere, Riene decided to  sleep in her family’s estate and leave the next day. She had just  enough time to draw a hot bath and call her friends regarding their  destination. It appeared that the Acherons had sent a handful to  Ireland but the rest were in China, willing to tag along with Marsa  Rosemont on her travels. Riene said she’d take the first flight  there and then went about the process of arranging it. Many worlds  still had air travel as well as space, but only for short flights;  the longer ones were taken into space. As Riene undressed and slipped  into the steaming water, she pulled out a book on Chinese from a  shelf and started brushing up on her Mandarin.</p>
<p>“And Hindi, I can’t forget that,” she reminded  herself. The bath was exactly what she needed after what felt like a  long day (even though dinner had barely lasted forty minutes), and  the fuzzy salmon-colored robe with her initials on it was the  proverbial icing on the cake. As she toddled to her old room (which  had been converted to a guest room since she left), Riene spotted her  youngest sister, Mireille, apparently on her way to bathe as well.</p>
<p>“Feeling better?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, very much.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. You going to bed now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s been a tiring day.” Mireille was  silent for a moment.</p>
<p>“Will you be leaving tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm, first thing. I’ll be off to China.”</p>
<p>“Oh, cool. For business?”</p>
<p>“And pleasure,” Riene smiled. Mireille grinned  shyly.</p>
<p>“I envy you,” she whispered. Riene blinked at her  and she faltered. “Uh, well anyway, pleasant dreams.”</p>
<p>“Yes, you too. Goodnight.” Riene slept soundly,  dreaming of the time she went fishing with Lorenzo, and woke up to a  pink and purple sky, the sun gently peeking over the horizon. No  amount of persuasion could convince her to stay another day: Riene  had accomplished what she came here to do and seemed more confident  about her choice as she embraced her large, overbearing family.</p>
<p>“You take care,” Lorenzo said as he kissed her.  “And give my love to you-know-who.”</p>
<p>“I will. Write to me. You too, Mireille!”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Riene felt the urgency in her hug and drew  back, a little startled. For such a long time, she had believed  Lorenzo to be the only other “deviant” in the family (probably  because he was the only one who had been treated as such), but who  knows how many of her siblings, cousins, nephews, nieces— or even  her own parents— wished that their lives had turned out  differently? The possibility that they were all envious of her  gallivanting crossed her mind, and she felt an overwhelming sense of  new love for these people, who only acted as any of us would around a  celebrity or somebody they admired: clumsily, without many good form  or graces, sometimes roughly but never without their charms. She  realized she had been too critical of them, and was fearful for  nothing.</p>
<p>“Don’t be a stranger now, young miss!” her father  shouted. “If your, uh…pastime turns out to be too much for you,  feel free to come back anytime now.”</p>
<p>“At least feel free to write us more often!” her  mother said. She smiled and promised she would, but she had a plane  to catch and couldn’t stay another minute. She had some tears as  she got into her cab, but Riene Latoli certainly did not look back.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Vimmy: Do I really get some lines, it’s high time,  remember I’m a member of this crew as well, yes, the wealthiest and  probably most influential, so what if I’m not a sexual goddess like  half the crew or an expert in some field like the other half, and  does it really matter if I’m annoying, I need some screen time too,  damn it!</p>
<p>Aseria: In the next chapter, everybody ignores Vimmy!  That’s an adventure in itself since it’s not an easy thing to do.</p>
<p>Lyara: I thought we were going after Sharyn’s  treasure.</p>
<p>Sharyn: Nay, I possess all I’ll e’er need in thee,  dearest. (snuggles Lyara)</p>
<p>Aseria: Aww…</p>
<p>Allegra: Stop stealing my shtick!</p>
<p>Vimmy: Oh yes, and Sharyn’s treasure, yes, can’t  forget THAT, I mean, just because she’s an adorable and beautiful  woman who could most likely be a match for that traitor Mink in  battle, we needn’t completely ignore me, and didn’t Sharyn  already get a chapter or two dedicated to her?</p>
<p>Lillianne: Yikes, better make that TWO adventures! In  the next chapter, we head to Ireland and try our hardest to pretend  Vimmy doesn’t exist. Don’t miss “Beautiful Place in My Heart:  treasures of the Emerald Isle”. My question is, why hasn’t  someone squished her yet? I mean, she’s even smaller than Shana!</p>
<p>Aseria: Aww…</p>
<p>Allegra: Stop that!</p>
