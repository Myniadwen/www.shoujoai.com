Heinrich Himmler, 14 May 1928

------

The line of vehicles heading for Dachau resembled nothing so much as 
some sort of strange wagon train. Ambulances, troop vehicles filled with 
Red Cross nurses, and army jeeps all in single file slowly made their 
way along the rough unpaved roads. From her seat near the middle of one 
of the ambulances Sarah silently looked around her, noting that one 
could tell those who&#39;d been at the camp the previous day from those who 
were going there for the first time rather quickly. There was a 
melancholy gravity to those who, like her, were among the first to 
arrive at the recently liberated camp.

Sarah didn&#39;t even have to look very far to see the difference. Sitting 
next to her at the window seat was an older nurse with slightly graying 
hair who was solemnly reading a small Gideon&#39;s Bible, while on the other 
side of the aisle from Sarah sat two younger nurses conversing 
lightheartedly, the blonde one showing the brunette how she could take a 
puff on her cigarette, blow the smoke from her mouth, breathe it back in 
through her nostrils, then release it out her mouth once again just like 
Marlene Dietrich in the movies.

It was not surprising that there would be an influx of new faces. 
Indeed, the medical nightmare facing Dachau&#39;s liberators necessitated 
the mobilizing of as many doctors and nurses as the various M.A.S.H. 
units had to offer.

What was surprising, and disturbingly so, was the stench that was once 
again beginning to fill the air. Surprising, because the caravan of 
ambulances and supplies were still several miles away from the nearest 
of Dachau&#39;s satellite camps. As Sarah wondered about it, a noise outside 
the ambulance grabbed her attention. She looked out the window, past the 
nurse with the Gideon&#39;s Bible, and saw a large group of American 
soldiers and MPs headed in the opposite direction, heading away from 
Dachau. One or two of the soldiers actually wore full gas masks while 
most tied scarves and handkerchiefs over their noses and mouths.

As Sarah continued to look out, she saw more soldiers acting as escorts 
to a gray-haired old farmer who was being made to lead a horse and buggy 
loaded up with stacks of dead bodies. Behind them came a much larger 
wagon, also carting away corpses. Black flies and maggots swarmed the 
dead, and as a third wagon came into view the blonde and the brunette 
across from Sarah came over to look out the window with her and her 
neighbor. While the brunette&#39;s eyes began to water, someone from outside 
the ambulance began knocking on the swinging door. The driver opened the 
door, and Sarah recognized the face of Major Sanmartino.

&quot;Folks,&quot; he called over the murmuring of the doctors and nurses, &quot;I&#39;m 
Major Sanmartino with the 45th. I apologize for the delays, but this 
morning has brought a few changes to Dachau.&quot; He proceeded to explain 
that something of a changing of the guard had taken place. The E Company 
of the 40th Combat Engineers, which had been providing support for the 
45th Thunderbird, were now in charge of the concentration camp and its 
surrounding satellite camps, including the women&#39;s camp.

&quot;Since most of the citizens of Dachau have refused to believe that the 
conditions at the camp were as bad as they&#39;ve been told,&quot; Major 
Sanmartino said with almost a half-smirk, &quot;We&#39;ve declared martial law. 
The citizens themselves are to help with the rounding up of the dead, 
and those farmers,&quot; he said, motioning outside as yet another cart 
heavily laden with decomposing bodies, &quot;Are being made to cart the dead 
through the main public square and streets themselves on their way to a 
cemetery in Waldfriedhof.&quot;

Just then, there was a dull thump outside. Those in the ambulance 
watched as one of the wagon stopped and its driver, along with an M.P., 
went around the side of the wagon facing away from them for something. A 
few seconds later, a body that had fallen out of the cart was 
unceremoniously tossed back on, and the driver returned to the reigns of 
the cart as the M.P. once more followed close behind.

Clearing his throat to once more get everyone&#39;s attention, Major 
Sanmartino continued, &quot;Anyways, one of the farm wagons broke its axle, 
which is why your convoy has had to stop. Some of our boys are trying to 
help fix the damned thing, and hopefully you&#39;ll all be moving just as 
soon as...&quot; he was interrupted by the sound of a loud horn being blown 
near the front of the convoy, followed by the noise of several engines 
rumbling back to life at once. &quot;Speak of the devil,&quot; he said, &quot;Well, 
this is where I get off,&quot; and with that he headed for the door.

&quot;Major Martini,&quot; Sarah called out. Sanmartino turned, surprised to see 
the strange nurse from yesterday making her way down the narrow aisle to 
reach him. &quot;Major Martini, remember... Remember that inmate I asked you 
and your men about?&quot;

&quot;Yes Lieutenant,&quot; he said, shifting uncomfortably from one foot to the 
other as she stared hopefully at him. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he sighed. 
Quickly looking away from her crest-fallen face, the major left the 
ambulance to rejoin his men as Sarah slowly made her way back to her 
seat.

And so it went, with one group heading towards the camp while the other 
group headed in the opposite direction. Soon, the first of the satellite 
camps was reached, and some of the vehicles left the convoy. Several 
more left upon reaching the main concentration camp, before Sarah&#39;s 
ambulance brought her and the others back to the women&#39;s camp.

The first day back in the women&#39;s camp was quite chaotic for Sarah, who 
found herself trying to keep out of the way of the 40th Combat Engineers 
and the civilians being made to load the bodies into farm wagons as she 
wound her way past the makeshift hospital tents that had been erected 
since yesterday and back to the main medical facility. Once there, she 
was kept busy until after dusk acting as both nurse and interpreter, a 
task she found both physically and psychologically exhausting. Once more 
upon leaving she asked if anyone had seen the inmate with the pink 
triangle in her Star of David, and once more left the camp bitterly 
disappointed.

The next day, news arrived at the camp that on the previous day, April 
the thirtieth, Adolph Hitler had committed suicide. When the news was 
made known to the survivors of the camp, some of the women wept, while 
others looked rather smug about the news. Most of the former inmates 
though were too weak and out of it to even show interest in the fact.

Sarah, while happy that the despot was gone, found her happiness 
tampered by the fact that she had yet to find the girl with the 
beautiful grey eyes she&#39;d seen on her first day there. And with all the 
women still dying even after the liberation, she had no idea if she was 
even still alive or not.

On the third day, as Sarah was wiping down an examination table, a nurse 
with thick-rimmed glasses strode in, her jet black hair pulled back into 
a bun and a befuddled look on her face. &quot;Lieutenant,&quot; she asked 
half-hopefully, &quot;Do you speak Polish?&quot;

Sarah shook her head, &quot;Sorry, only Yiddish&quot; she said, adding, &quot;Isn&#39;t 
Corporal Rymut here today?&quot;

The other nurse shook her head, &quot;No, he had to rejoin his unit. And all 
the other Pole translators have already been spoken for by other 
doctors. Captain Stevens needs someone now.&quot;

Sarah furrowed her brow in thought as the other nurse looked on. 
&quot;Helena,&quot; she finally said, &quot;does the P.A. system in this camp still 
work?&quot;

Outside the medical building, idling next to the line of women waiting 
to be looked at, Gilda and Anja were sharing a bit of salt-water taffy.

&quot;You know,&quot; Anja said, &quot;If I were a few years younger, it would be me 
the G.I.s threw their chocolates and toffee at instead of you.&quot;

Gilda smiled good naturedly at the teasing, and was about to respond, 
when suddenly the camp speaker nearest them crackled as it was turned 
on. The sound of someone blowing into the speaker to test it could be 
heard, before a woman&#39;s voice speaking in Yiddish came over the system. 
&quot;Shalom, if anyone who can hear me speaks Polish, will you please come 
to the front of the line.&quot;

&quot;Gilda?&quot; Anja asked, noting the look of concentration in the younger 
woman&#39;s face as she had listened to the message, &quot;What was it, what did 
they say?&quot;

&quot;They need someone who can speak Polish,&quot; she said as she turned back to 
Anja, &quot;I&#39;ll be back.&quot; And with that, Gilda turned and slowly shuffled to 
the front of the line, earning several displeased looks from the other 
women waiting to get in. At the door, she made herself known to one of 
the nurses through hand gestures, pointing first at the camp speaker 
then at her open mouth. The nurse said something in English as she 
gently guided the frail young woman into the overly-crowded waiting 
room, motioning for her to wait next to a tall grandfather clock as she 
left the room.

Alone, staring at the second hand as it slowly traveled around the clock 
face, Gilda&#39;s mind began to wander...

------

She stood before the clock in the study nervously, watching the pendulum 
swing back and forth behind the glass frame of the large grandfather 
clock. As the seconds slowly ticked by, she began to wonder if asking 
Rabbi Kamoinka for this meeting was a good idea after all.

Shamayim Kamoinka had been her town&#39;s Rabbi, as well as a family friend 
to her parents, for as long as she could remember. Normally she looked 
forward to seeing him, either in the synagogue on Sabbath or on the 
streets on his way perhapse to a bris. His whiskers were quite white 
now, and reached down to his collar bone, and truth be told he had 
something of a belly, not so much of one that one would call him a 
glutton, but certainly he looked to be comfortably well-fed.

She usually loved to see his jovial face around her house, to take in 
his grandfatherly smile as he&#39;d sit and accept tea from her mom. He was 
the smartest man she knew, even smarter than her father. He was also the 
most well-respected man in the small Jewish community she belonged to, 
which was both why she was here, and why she was so anxious about seeing 
him.

At last, the sound of someone opening the door to the small room in the 
back of the synagogue brought Gilda around. She turned and made herself 
smile pleasantly at Rabbi Kamoinka as he walked into the room, a Hebrew 
newspaper tucked under his arm. &quot;Shalom, Rabbi.&quot;

&quot;Shalom, little Gilda,&quot; he said, motioning to a nearby black chair next 
to a potted plant. &quot;Please, be seated.&quot;

Gilda nodded, then went and promptly sat down. The rabbi pulled an old, 
well-worn pipe from his jacket pocket. &quot;Now then,&quot; he said pleasantly as 
he reached into a second pocket and pulled out a half-empty bag of 
tobacco, &quot;What did you need to see me about?&quot;

Gilda looked down to see that her palms were sweating. Trying her best 
to wipe them off on her skirt discreetly, she took a deep breath and 
began, &quot;Rabbi Kamoinka, my... My father, he&#39;s been talking to Mr. Rotem 
the butcher, about his son Bez. And, they&#39;re discussing arranging a 
marriage between me and Bez.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; the rabbi said, his eyes twinkling as he looked ready to 
congratulate the young girl, &quot;And let me guess, you wish to ask me to 
perform the ceremony, yes? Well, normally it&#39;s the husband to be who 
arranges such things, but...&quot;

&quot;N... No,&quot; Gilda interrupted, &quot;That&#39;s not it. I wish you to please talk 
my father and Mr. Rotem out of it.&quot;

Rabbi Kamoinka was taken aback. &quot;Talk them out of it?&quot; he asked 
incredulously, &quot;But why?&quot;

&quot;Rabbi, are... are we quite alone?&quot; Gilda suddenly asked as she now 
looked once more around the study. There was a desk near the window 
overlooking the flower garden outside that was covered with papers, 
journals and assorted knick-knacks such as a magnifying glass, a pair of 
scissors, and a pen lying next to a closed bottle of ink. Behind the 
desk was a large wall library filled with books, some looking quite old, 
and some with quite ornate covers, their Hebrew titles gilded in faded 
gold across the spines.

Rabbi Kamoinka lit his pipe, took a puff or two on it, all the time 
looking curiously upon young Gilda Grozheim, &quot;My child, we are never 
alone. There is always one above us,&quot; he said as he pointed upward.

Gilda smiled back out of courtesy as she nervously pushed her glasses 
back up the bridge of her nose, &quot;Yes, of course Rabbi. What I meant 
was...&quot;

&quot;I knew what you meant,&quot; he said as he drew the pipe back from his lips, 
&quot;There is no one around to eavesdrop in on our conversation. Now what 
seems to be the trouble Gilda? Why don&#39;t you wish to marry Bez?&quot;

Gilda Grozheim swallowed hard under her rabbi&#39;s gaze. A hundred 
different answers presented themselves to her; Bez&#39; face looked too 
narrow, like it was being pressed between the sliding doors of a bus. 
Whenever he saw her with her mother or father come into his father&#39;s 
butcher shop he always seemed to leer at her uncomfortably. He had the 
smell of a butcher about him, that sort of nauseating coppery stench 
that made Gilda thankful when they left Mr. Rotem&#39;s shop. In the end 
though, her thoughts kept coming back to the same thing, the same truth 
she knew she could never tell Rabbi Kamoinka.

Bez Rotem was a boy, and she knew she could never love him.

After several seconds of silence, the rabbi gave a sigh. &quot;Gilda,&quot; he 
said in a paternal tone as he once more brought the pipe to his lips, 
&quot;You&#39;re no longer a child anymore. You&#39;ll be eighteen soon, and out of 
school. I&#39;ve watched you growing up, seen how you love your sports, your 
walks in the woods, your independence.&quot; At that, he narrowed his gaze as 
he weighed his words most carefully, &quot;Gilda, you&#39;re a young woman now. 
It&#39;s time for you to &#145;be fruitful and multiply,&#39; as Hashem has ordained 
for you and all young people. It&#39;s time to become a momma yourself, to 
give up the woods and the streams and raise up a family.&quot;

Gilda felt herself dying inside at Rabbi Kamoinka&#39;s words. &quot;B... But,&quot; 
she muttered miserably, &quot;I don&#39;t love him. I don&#39;t love Bez Rotem.&quot;

At that, her rabbi began to chuckle. &quot;Is that all this is about?&quot; he 
asked good naturedly, &quot;Why Gilda my child, don&#39;t worry about that. 
You&#39;ll learn to love him,&quot; he said with a wink.

A short time later, Gilda left. As a warm summer breeze blew through the 
town, she crossed her arms and headed for the woods on the outskirts of 
her village. Finding a familiar, well-worn trail through the tall 
grasses, she took it and let it lead her up a hill that overlooked her 
town. There were two appointments she had made for today, and she&#39;d just 
kept one of them.

She frowned. Her visit with the rabbi had been disastrous, and she now 
knew that there was no longer any possibility of escaping an engagement. 
She began to prepare herself for what must now come next, what she knew 
would be an awful scene.

&quot;We... We can&#39;t do this anymore,&quot; she whispered to herself as she tried 
to find the right words to use, &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be together. It&#39;s 
unnatural, it&#39;s a perversion. Girls are meant to be with boys, to run a 
home and raise children and...&quot; she stopped, biting her lip as her eyes 
began to water. &quot;No,&quot; she whispered, reaching a hand up to wipe at her 
eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t cry, I won&#39;t cry,&quot; she muttered, the last part coming out 
almost as a hiss. Taking a deep breath, she continued once more on the 
winding path up the hill. &quot;You see, I... I&#39;m to marry Bev, the butcher&#39;s 
son. I...&quot; she stopped once more, a sob escaping from her as she covered 
her mouth and shook. Once more she was compelled to stop, to calm down 
and wipe the tears away before continuing. This time, she decided to 
just wait until she saw her and then explain.

She didn&#39;t have long to wait. In no time at all, too soon it seemed in 
fact, she was there, at their spot. Alka looked over at her and smiled 
as she patted a spot of grass covered by a blanket next to her, the 
younger girl&#39;s blonde locks braided into twin pony tails than hung down 
both sides of the back of her head and reached to the bottom of her 
shoulders. For the second time that day, Gilda made herself smile as she 
went and sat next to her.

They sat together under the maple tree up on the hill, the view 
providing them a lovely panorama of the ducks swimming in the small pond 
below in the valley and their school further out near the post office 
across from the synagogue. The shade of the maple as well as the birch 
and the many ferns surrounding them on the hill protected them from the 
heat of the summer&#39;s day as Alka leaned over and lay her head on the 
tomboy&#39;s shoulder. Closing her eyes, the blonde smiled happily as Gilda 
put her arm around her and held her closely, almost protectively.

&quot;Gilda,&quot; Alka whispered as she snuggled closer, &quot;Why are you late? Is 
anything wrong?&quot;

She&#39;d wanted to end it; she knew she should, and she knew why. But now, 
with Alka sitting here beneath the maple next to her, her breath 
tickling against her neck as she held her close, Gilda knew she 
couldn&#39;t. She&#39;d once thought Alka simply cute, a pretty little plaything 
for her to enjoy. Somehow, that was no longer true. Alka was still 
pretty to Gilda, but now she was something more to her as well, 
something precious and sweet.

&quot;No, nothing at all,&quot; she said, cursing herself for her weakness and 
cowardice as she brought her lips to Alka&#39;s. She would lose her, she 
knew, once the engagement was made public. She would marry and have 
children and be miserable for it. But here and now, on top of this hill 
overlooking her village, she still had her Alka.

------

Gilda was brought back to the present by the sound of someone gasping in 
surprise. Turning to her right, she involuntarily smiled at the nurse 
now entering the waiting room. &quot;Aniol,&quot; she whispered as the nurse 
slowly came towards her.

Sarah couldn&#39;t believe her eyes; she&#39;d begun to wonder if she&#39;d ever 
find the girl again. &quot;H... Hello again,&quot; she said in Yiddish.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Gilda said back, adding, &quot;I heard over the system that you 
needed someone who speaks Polish?&quot;

Sarah could hardly believe her good fortune, &quot;Yes, we need someone who 
can translate Polish to me so I can translate it into English for the 
doctor. We&#39;ll probably be together most of the day, if that&#39;s alright,&quot; 
she said, bushing at how the last part probably sounded.

Gilda nodded. &quot;Yes, of course,&quot; she said happily. Her angel was back, 
and wanted to know if she&#39;d like to spend the day with her? Such a 
foolish question! Translate Polish or skin potatoes, it mattered little 
enough to Gilda as long as she once more was able to look at the 
beautiful nurse before her. She took a few weak, shaky steps towards 
her.

Sarah, seeing the young woman&#39;s difficulty, immediately went to her and 
offered her arm. The other woman placed her hand in the crook of Sarah&#39;s 
arm for support, and both women began making their way through the 
crowded room to the doctor&#39;s office. &quot;By the way,&quot; she said as she 
reached the door, &quot;I never got your name last time.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Gilda, Gilda Grozheim. Your&#39;s?&quot;

&quot;Sarah Shore,&quot; the nurse answered as she opened the door and led Gilda 
in.

-End Notes-

Sorry about the ridiculously long wait between chapters. Let&#39;s just say 
life&#39;s been incredibly hectic the past few months. Hopefully there won&#39;t 
be nearly as long a wait for the next chapter (crosses fingers).
