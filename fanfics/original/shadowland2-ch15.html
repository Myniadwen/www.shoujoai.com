<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 15 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Amy fastened the new bandage to Kim&#39;s shaky arm, &quot;There you go.&quot; She 
patted the girl on the head, &quot;See that did not hurt much now did it?&quot; 
She confirmed with a warm smile.

Kim held her newly bandaged arm close to her chest and slowly nodded in 
agreement with the nurse. 

Amy continued to smile, she had been forcing herself to smile the entire 
time in hopes none of the girl&#39;s had noticed her own distress of the 
situation at hand. That feeling within had grown increasingly more 
intense and she was becoming even more anxious with every passing 
minute. She was almost certain that Penny was not the cause of her 
stress, the girl may be in a coma like state, but that was not usual for 
the girls of Whispering Hills. It had to be something far worse to set 
off her nerves on such an edge. She watched carefully as Kima sat beside 
Penny, a troubled look etched across her face. Amy found it interesting 
that this reflection was suddenly felt responsible for her actions; 
maybe her chance encounter with Penny was meant to be. 

&quot;Amy,&quot; Kima suddenly spoke up, everyone could sense the amount of 
concern was in the redhead&#39;s voice, &quot;Is it really... my fault that... 
that Penny is like this?&quot; She asked softly. 

Amy approached Kima and set a hand on her head, &quot;No.&quot; She replied, 
glancing down at Penny&#39;s motionless figure. She muddled over her 
thoughts as she tried to figure out a way to comfort the youth when the 
main entrance way flung open and Head Mistresses burst into the room. 
Amy noticed immediately Jenn&#39;s shaking form in Sophia&#39;s arms, &quot;What 
happened?&quot; She exclaimed uneasily.

&quot;Drake happened!&quot; Melissa explained simply as she entered with Natalie 
at her side, Melissa&#39;s face long with distress. 

&quot;I am glad you are here, Amy.&quot; Sophia remarked as she quickly crossed 
the lobby, taking note of Penny&#39;s presence, and laid Jenn down on a 
couch across from the other girl, setting the shopping bags to the side 
of the couch. 

Tanya and Kai sprung from her spots next to the pool table, &quot;Jenn!!&quot; 
Tanya exclaimed as they both running over to the sofa and looked upon 
the shaking form of her friend. 

&quot;Auntie!!&quot; Kai wrapped her arms around Sophia&#39;s waists and the woman 
returned the hug. 

Tanya dropped to the ground next to Jenn. &quot;Is she alright?&quot; Tanya asked 
even more apprehensively.

Jenn was curled up into a ball and was mumbling incoherently. Her eyes 
darting around as if she was unaware of her surroundings, 

Sophia hesitated, a look of uncertainty upon her face that gave Tanya a 
disquieting feeling. Then The Head Mistress smiled at Tanya, &quot;She should 
be fine.&quot; She finally replied, an answer that did not set well on 
Tanya&#39;s mind. 

Melissa quickly glanced around the lobby, &quot;Where are Kris and Alyson?&quot; 
She inquired fearfully. 

&quot;Alyson ran off to her room.&quot; Tanya replied, &quot;Kris and Jessica went back 
to their room.&quot; She explained disapprovingly, nodding towards the 
stairs. 

&quot;Could you tell Kris she is needed down here?&quot; Sophia asked Tanya 
politely, then turned to Natalie, &quot;and Natalie, could you take Melissa 
and Amy to Alyson&#39;s room.&quot;

Quickly the girls rushed off on their appointed tasks. A heavy air 
filled the lobby that was broken by Kima voice, &quot;Is everything going to 
be alright?&quot; She asked the Head Mistress. 

Sophia let out a worried sigh, &quot;I hope so.&quot; She glanced from Jenn to 
Penny, &quot;I truly hope so.&quot; 

******

Earlier Kris had led Jessica to their room and locked the door. She 
stood with her back leaning against the door, her arms crossed and her 
eyes partially closed as if she was in deep thought. 

&quot;What did you want to talk about&quot; Jessica finally asked, anxiously 
shifting from one foot to another. Kris had been giving her odd looks 
ever since their experience in the lobby and it was worrying Jessica, 
Kris&#39;s current pose was not helping matters. Jessica swallowed hard and 
took a tentative step closer to her friend, &quot;K... Kris... Are... are you 
alright?&quot; She nervously inquired.  

Kris&#39;s eyes suddenly fluttered opened and she glared at Jessica. Her 
eyes held such an intensity to them that is caused Jessica to stumble 
backwards against Kris&#39;s bed and sit down. The two watched each other in 
silence for a moment when Kris finally stepped away from the door and 
brushed a hand through her short curls, &quot;Tell me the truth.&quot; She softly 
demanded ruffling her own hair, &quot;What happened down there? Is this all 
one of your games?&quot; She asked as she slightly nibbled on her lips, her 
eyes pleaded to Jessica to explain, to free her from the pain in her 
heart. 

&quot;I...&quot; Jessica suddenly found it hard to look the girl in the eye and 
turned her head to stare out the window, &quot;I know what you are thinking 
and I can&#39;t blame you.&quot; She admitted ashamed of herself. She knew how 
the other girls viewed her; to them she was nothing more then a slut. 
Always preying on the other girls in the dorm, but that was not how it 
was. She didn&#39;t like how she was and could not help herself. She tried 
to think of how to explain things but every time she opened her mouth 
not a single word came out. 

&quot;So... what is it?&quot; Kris insisted with growing agitation, &quot;I need to 
know. Are you planning to play with my heart and throw it away like all 
the others you&#39;ve toyed with?&quot; There was a hint of anger in her voice. 

Jessica flinched at Kris&#39;s words, &quot;I&#39;ve never meant to hurt anyone. I 
just....&quot; She tried to explain shaking her head defensively. She faced 
Kris with sadness in her eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t explain it easily, but I never 
toyed with anyone&#39;s hearts and I&#39;m truly not trying to hurt you. I...&quot; 
Her lips quivered as she hesitated, her mind racing, Kris&#39;s anger filled 
eyes not letting go of her. She needed to say something. She opened her 
mouth and yet still no words came forth. It was as if a misery Jessica 
had long forgotten escaped its cage and attacked the girl&#39;s heart, 
taking another breath she tried again, &quot;I...&quot; Her voice closed up and 
she could feel tears welling up in the corner of her right eye, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; She wiped at the tear.

The sight of the distress in Jessica&#39;s eyes caused Kris&#39;s anger faded 
and she reached out to gently take Jessica&#39;s cheek in her hand, 
&quot;Jessie...&quot; Kris sat down next to her roommate, her own heart pounding 
wildly in her chest. Kris was always thinking of Jenn and never noticed 
the way Jessica looked at her before, a look of longing and caring. She 
had only became aware it just recently. She was so blinded by the past 
to even realize that there was someone else who cared for her so dearly. 

Jessica anxiously looked down at her hands; &quot;I&#39;ve been watching you for 
years.&quot; Jessica remarked guiltily, &quot;Since the first time I saw you 
outside of the Head Mistress&#39;s house all those years ago.&quot; Everything 
she had ever wanted to tell the girl started to spill forth from her 
mind and she found herself unable to stop herself from telling Kris 
everything. She looked into Kris&#39;s eyes with newfound determination. 
&quot;You were watching the other girls in the field. There was such 
loneliness in your eyes, but I was afraid of talking to you, just like 
everyone else.&quot; If Kris was going to reject her she was going to first 
let Kris know exactly how she felt. &quot;I would watch you from my dorm 
window as you sat in the trees watching the other girls, almost as if 
you didn&#39;t want to get to close. Something about that mysterious girl 
always drew me in. I&#39;ve always wanted to talk to you, but never got up 
the nerve.&quot; She explained in one breath and she rang her hands together 
nervously. 

Kris felt herself sink into the bed. She was stunned to hear what she 
was being told. She could not think of how to respond to what she was 
hearing. 

Seeing that Kris was not going to reply Jessica continued her story, 
&quot;When I heard you were moving into the Western Dorms my heart danced. It 
was like a dream come true.&quot; Her eyes nervously darted from Kris&#39;s eyes 
to her hands and back, &quot;When Head Mistress Sophia asked me to watch over 
you it was greater then anything I&#39;d ever dreamed would happen. I could 
be your friend and at least help you be happy again. At the most I 
wanted to be just your friend, someone who is there for you no matter 
what. I wanted to take that sad look from your eyes.&quot; She explained 
sadly, &quot;I admit that I&#39;ve slept with a lot of girls, but I don&#39;t let 
them touch me.&quot; She clenched at her chest as her darkest secrets started 
to come forth, &quot;I can&#39;t explain why. I just feel this need to be in 
their arms. I can&#39;t help myself, but I always felt uncomfortable about 
their touch. That is until today.&quot; Jessica swallowed hard and looked 
into Kris&#39;s eyes, &quot;Until you. I&#39;ve always felt strongly for you and when 
I was in your arms I felt safe for the first time. I always wanted to 
hold you tight in my arms I just never felt right telling you 
because...&quot;

Kris lowered her head, &quot;Because I had Jenn, right?&quot; She inquired 
solemnly. She could not look at Jessica any longer, she felt ashamed of 
herself for not noticing Jessica&#39;s feelings before. She felt so stupid. 
She was always talking about Jenn this or Jenn that. Not even 
considering Jessica&#39;s feelings.

&quot;I&#39;ve always known about Jenn.&quot; Jessica replied, &quot;Everyone knew. It was 
rather obvious. The way the two of you would talk together while all the 
others feared you. I was happy knowing that you were happy, but seeing 
you lately was tearing me apart. I&#39;ve been trying to keep myself under 
control, however I keep longing for a kiss...&quot; Her voice trailed off 
with the last few words and she dropped her eyes to the ground, &quot;I think 
I love you...&quot; She muttered softly. Part of her wished that she could 
take those words back. That she could lock her heart away again and 
forget about these feelings. She awaited Kris to place her verdict, 
awaiting the punishment that she deserved for her actions over these 
years, was even prepared for Kris to demand to be moved to another room, 
she didn&#39;t feel she deserved someone&#39;s love and understood if Kris hated 
her. 

Kris thought over what Jessica had said very carefully, then placed her 
hands under the girl&#39;s chin and forced Jessica to look her in the eye, 
inspecting the girl&#39;s eyes in search of some hint of a lie, yet all she 
was greeted by was sadness. Kris pulled the girl into her arms and 
hugged her tightly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She whispered quietly. 

Jessica began to quiver, &quot;I... I know... you can never love me...&quot; She 
stammered, &quot;No one could ever love someone as dirty as me.&quot; Her heart 
prepared for this outcome. 

Kris&#39;s eyes became hard, &quot;You are not dirty!&quot; She exclaimed sternly. 

&quot;You don&#39;t have to pretend.&quot; She sucked in a trembled breath and let it 
out, &quot;You have Jenn after all.&quot; She sorrowfully admitted.

Kris shook her head slowly, then pulled back so she could look Jessica 
in the eyes once again, &quot;I...&quot; She tried to consider how to word things. 
She knew deep in her heart that Jenn would not be returning to her. That 
agony in Jessica&#39;s eyes made Kris realize that maybe she didn&#39;t need to 
be alone, &quot;Maybe...&quot; She muttered taking in a deep breath. She nervously 
ran her hand through her hair and scratched the back of her head, 
&quot;Maybe... maybe this was the way things were meant too be.&quot; She stated 
with a small smile. 

Jessica gave the girl a puzzled look, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; She 
asked slightly afraid of the answer. 

&quot;I mean this.&quot; Kris leaned forwards and placed a soft kiss upon 
Jessica&#39;s lips. Jessica was surprised as first, then wrapped her arms 
around the girl and deepened the kiss, letting the warmth wash over her. 
Nothing felt so right in her life, tears brimmed in her eyes as she felt 
Kris make no attempt to pull away. The two girls&#39; slowly fell sideways 
upon the bed and Jessica rolled over, partly atop of Kris. When their 
lips finally parted Jessica felt herself shiver all over. The two looked 
into each other eyes and Kris eventually spoke, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I hurt you so 
mu-&quot; 

Jessica stopped the girl&#39;s words with another kiss; her body filled with 
heat and her heart was overwhelmed with warmth. She broke free of the 
kiss and smiled down at the girl, her eyes darting over Kris&#39;s body and 
she reached down to unfasten Kris&#39;s pants only to have Kris stop her. 

&quot;Wait...&quot; Kris commanded causing Jessica to startle. She stared at Kris 
like a child who had been caught writing on the walls. 

&quot;But...&quot; Jessica stammered, &quot;I...&quot; There was confusion in her eyes and 
Jessica seemed to be lost, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m horrible...&quot; She tried to 
crawl out of the bed only to have Kris grab her by the shoulder. 

&quot;You are not!&quot; Kris explained, &quot;You are not horrible. You are not dirty. 
You are none of that.&quot; Kris wrapped her arms around Jessica and hugged 
her tight. For the first time Kris thought she saw why it was that 
Jessica was at the Academy. All the rumours about the girl seemed to 
make some kind of sense and Kris felt a desire to learn more about the 
girl. The two lay holding each other for a moment when there was a knock 
upon their door, &quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; Jessica stated sniffling as she rolled 
out of the bed and got to her feet. She dragged her feet as she crossing 
the room to open the door. Her despair only deepened as she was faced 
with a rather upset looking Tanya. 

Tanya glared at Jessica then over the girl&#39;s shoulder at Kris and back 
to the dorm head. There was almost hatred in her eyes. 

&quot;Uhhh...Hi Tanya...&quot; Jessica nervously stepped back from the girl, &quot;Is 
there something wrong?&quot; She asked warily, still forcing herself to smile 
as if nothing was worrying her.

Tanya pushed passed Jessica and headed directly towards Kris, &quot;Jenn 
needs you.&quot; She explained coldly. 

Kris quickly got to her feet, &quot;What happened?&quot;
