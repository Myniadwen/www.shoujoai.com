~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Final Arena, The Stone Ruins 

A brand new morning. Yoko stretched her limbs and arms, cracked her 
knuckles, rolled her head round in circles. Warm ups were boring, but 
necessary. At least this way she would not pull a muscle or something. 
Besides, the arena that the last battle was taking place in seemed like 
a place for the strongest and most prepared. It was the ruins of a stone 
shrine. The arena was built on top of a huge stone platform, with steps 
trailing downwards from the outside, like a pyramid, with the ring at 
the peak. 

This match was obviously different than the others. Yoko was dressed in 
her usual fighting gear, her black and white Gi, white headband with the 
black sun, hands and feet taped, and her dark hair tied up in a 
ponytail. Just a metre away from he was Xiangau He had dressed down for 
the occasion. All he was wearing, was his black and gold Aztec-imprinted 
leggings, two black glove on his hands. They were both facing forward, 
on a pathway that led up to a small throne on the side of the platform. 
On that throne was the leader of the KAIGA Group, Reinhalt Schwarzluft. 

The man who Yoko suspected was behind the killing of Li Ming&#146;s parents. 
Beside him, was a stand. And on that stand was a oval stone, covered 
with shallow ridges and ancient symbols that were complete gibberish to 
Yoko. But at the same time, they felt somehow familiar. Yoko also 
suspected that that thing was the Stone Egg. But why bring it here?

Reinhalt spoke as soon as he was comfortable. &#147;Greetings, warriors. I am 
Reinhalt Schwarzluft. And I am greatly impressed with the fighting skill 
the two of you have displayed so far. You have made it to the finals of 
the championships The winner of this fight will win 200, 000 credits of 
money and will be named as &#145;God of Fighting&#146;. Now. Take your places in 
the arena.&#148;

Both Xiangau and Yoko nodded to Reinhalt in respect, then bowed to each 
other. They separated and walked around the stone arena, then climbed up 
the steps of their respective side. In seconds, they were face to face.

Reinhalt spoke again from his seated position. &#147;Let the final round of 
the God of Fighting Grand Championships&#133; begin!&#148;

Yoko readied herself. By drawing up her left hand near her chin, and her 
right one near her side, always slightly tilted. Her feet slowly began 
moving, slowly to her left side, her eyes remaining on Xiangau. He did 
not have his guard up. 

&#145;Hmmm. I wonder what that might mean&#133;&#146; Yoko thought. &#145;Maybe that&#146;s his 
normal stance, to stand unguarded. Either that, or he&#146;s seriously 
overconfident It doesn&#146;t matter, either way. I&#146;ll lure him out with a 
few blows.&#146; 

&#147;Yaah!&#148; Yoko pulled back both hands to her side and ran forward, towards 
Xiangau. His face was as calm and as neutral is it had always been. That 
was, until Yoko came within striking distance. Once she was close, 
Xiangau&#146;s eyes flashed open, his face twisting with motion. Yoko thrust 
a punch in his direction. Xiangau, like lightning, dodged the fist. Yoko 
blinked She could barely see Xiangau&#146;s movement. He circled around her 
body with brilliant speed, as if Yoko was standing still. By the time 
Yoko withdrew her fist, she felt another one slam her back.

&#147;Ah!&#148; Yoko slid forward, her feet grinding against the stone. Xiangau 
was behind her! She swung around to face him, and projected her leg to 
strike him, as high against the face as she could. 

Again, Xiangau did not get hit. His face avoided the kick, inches of 
distance, as his body bent backwards below it. As soon as Yoko withdrew 
her hand, Xiangau attacked, attempting to punch her. Yoko tilted her 
head to the side quickly, and followed up with another punch. Xiangau 
blocked this his right hand, and cast one of his own with the left Yoko 
blocked that punch, believing to be at a stalemate. She lost that 
believe Xiangau flawlessly flashed his hand into Yoko&#146;s stomach with a 
violent punch. He gave a second with his other hand, a hook, that 
crossed Yoko&#146;s face and jerked it to one side. Saliva was propelled from 
her lips. Xiangau rose his legs and tried to kick Yoko. The black-haired 
girl ducked under it, and slid away, to put some distance between them. 

As soon as Yoko got away, she began thinking again. &#145;Damn. He&#146;s pretty 
swift for someone so strong&#133; how will I accommodate for that?&#146;

Xiangau came for her, while she thought this. He attacked with a palm 
strike, strong and speedy Yoko dodged again, moving to the left, then 
moving to the right as a second came Yoko sidestepped a third, then went 
on the assault. She bent her arm at the elbow, and shot that elbow at 
the ribs of Xiangau. He crouched down and caught the elbow lunge with 
his hands, then pushed. Yoko was rocked backwards. She stumbled back, 
her feet zigzagging awkwardly. Xiangau growled and crouched to the 
ground, pressing his fingertips on the cool, dusty stone. He span his 
body with an outstretched leg in a 180 degree motion. The younger woman 
was kicked off her feet, and her back slapped against the stone of the 
arena. 

Yoko looked up to see Xiangau&#146;s fist descending in her direction. She 
acted before it was too late, speedily rolling backwards  to avoid it. 
Xiangau&#146;s fist hit the floor and the floor only, creating a fist-shaped 
dent. Yoko hopped backwards, while Xiangau advanced again. He was all 
over her. A kick came. It rammed Yoko&#146;s stomach. She gasped and leaned 
forward from the shocking speed of the blow. Xiangau crouched down as he 
strode forward, pulling back his right arm. He drove his curling arm 
upward and forward, battering Yoko&#146;s chin with an uppercut. It took her 
off her feet, her head jerking back. Yoko shut one eye and strained to 
regain control. While hovering, curled up and she flipped around once, 
uncurling and landing to the ground in an upright position. 

Xiangau gave her a disparaging glance. &#147;You are not giving me your all! 
You keep making mistakes! Don&#146;t let them cost you this match Fight with 
all you have!&#148;

Yoko sucked in air. &#147;Don&#146;t you worry about me. You should be worrying 
more about yourself, Xiangau.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;ll see&#133;&#148;

Xiangau stood firm while watching Yoko. He did something. Xiangau pulled 
his arm upwards then clenched his hand into a fist, in front of his 
face. He took a breath, and his hand began shaking, knuckles popping and 
veins growing in sight. With no warning he drew his hand away from his 
face, swung it around his body, then swung it back, yelling,  

&#147;Hakirute!&#148; 

Yoko blinked Though absolutely nothing touched her, she felt something 
ram her stomach. She gasped and scowled, feeling her body being sprung 
from its feet and hurled backward, down to the ground. Yoko scoffed 
angrily. She breathed in, then rolled to her side, looking at the dusty 
stone she had been knocked down against once more. That technique he 
used&#133; Xiangau simply swayed his hand in the air, and Yoko was forced to 
the ground. There was a two metre distance between them and she was 
knocked to the ground. Then she remembered something. Something he 
grandfather had told her&#133;

{Yoko&#133; one day you may come across an opponent that can use an ability 
called &#145;Hakirute&#146;, the &#145;Wave Cutting Hand&#146;. It is a brilliant technique. 
The warrior focuses motion into his or her own fist and propels that 
motion against the enemy. When a person is strong enough, it can be used 
to completely knock someone out of their guard. It is powerful, but you 
must watch out for its sister move, &#145;Kazekirute&#146;, the &#145;Wind Cutting 
Hand&#146;. That technique can be lethal&#133;} 

Yoko stood up with a groan. Xiangau had more abilities than she would 
have previously thought But why wasn&#146;t she fight at her best? It wasn&#146;t 
like she didn&#146;t try. She believed that she was giving her all. What was 
she doing wrong?

Yoko looked at her taped hands, not even realizing that this made her 
vulnerable to another attack from Xiangau. Was she holding back? If so&#133; 
why? Was there something inside her that was&#133; somehow afraid to try her 
best? Or maybe&#133; there was a part of her that was afraid to try her best&#133; 
and yet somehow still lose. Xiangau was such a forceful opponent. More 
skilled than anyone she had ever faced before. Even more than her 
brother, Ryo. 

&#145;I&#146;m doubting myself&#133;&#146; Yoko contemplated privately. &#145;I&#146;m afraid that&#133; if 
I give him my all, and I lose, it&#146;ll mean I&#146;m failing as a martial 
artist&#133; but does it really mean that? Coming this far is enough&#133; my 
father would be proud of all that I have accomplished&#133; why am I afraid 
to lose&#133;?&#146; 

Xiangau watched as Yoko though privately. He knew what was going through 
her mind. And he knew that she would come to the right conclusion. 
Minutes later, he was proven right. Yoko lowered her hands and looked 
up, a smile on her face and a twinkle in her eye

&#147;I&#146;m ready!&#148; She said brightly

Xiangau gave another rare smile. &#147;&#133;Good.&#148;

Yoko got back into her fighting stance and waited for Xiangau&#146;s attack 
He clutched his hand into a fist again, bringing it up to his face. As 
before, he gained momentum, gathering his &#145;motion&#146; into his tight hand. 
It shook, it trembled, and it was ready. Xiangau drew his hand back, 
while Yoko just waited. Xiangau swung his hand around in a circular 
movement, calling out fiercely, 

&#147;Kazekirute!&#148;

Yoko knew that one was coming. She rolled to her left as she saw the air 
warp in front of her. The slashing technique cut through the air in a 
solid stroke, and left the arena. It sliced the head off one of the 
decaying statues that surrounded the ring The head fell to the ground 
and smashed in bits. Yoko breathed a sigh of relief The Kazekirute was a 
strange move. It could effortlessly cut stone and metal, but did not 
have the power to slice flesh. What it could do, was rupture bone and 
bruise muscle. If not for amount of time it took to prepare, a lot more 
people would have used that ability. If Xiangau was using it against 
her, it probably meant that he really did want a good fight. 

Which was exactly what Yoko was going to give him. &#145;Let&#146;s see&#133; how to 
attack. He&#146;s much stronger than me, but I think I&#146;m a little faster than 
he is. Maybe I can find a way to surprise him&#133; and create an opening&#133;&#146;

Yoko assumed her fighting stance again, pulled her right fist up for a 
punch, and began running toward Xiangau. He blinked as she charged him, 
easily predicting what Yoko was going to do. She was going to try and 
punch him. He didn&#146;t she would be so foolish as to raise her hand for a 
punch at that distance. No matter Xiangau put his guard up this time, 
and waited for Yoko to reach him. In seconds she did, and Xiangau thrust 
a leg at her. Yoko grinned, and then crouched down, completely avoiding 
the kick. Yoko then shoved out the fist at her side, which exploded with 
bright orange flames, and surrounded her punch with magnificent flaming 
energy 

&#147;Ouuggh!&#148;

Xiangau was nailed in the stomach, hard, with the force of Yoko&#146;s 
Asagawa Fist. The technique she had invented against Ryoma Taneda and 
used against Li Ming She pulled her hand away from his stomach and 
wasted no time following up. She projected her fist upward, uppercutting 
the older boy. Once she was up on her feet, Yoko returned to the attack, 
punching Xiangau across the jaw with a second punch, and gave one final 
knee kick to his ribs. Xiangau grunted, his upper body leaning into 
Yoko&#146;s leg. Yoko pulled it back, then shot her elbow into his back with 
a thump. It nailed the centre of the silver-haired boy&#146;s back and made 
him topple, falling to the ground and whipping up dust. 

Yoko hopped away from Xiangau, her hands flashing back into a guarded 
position. The downed man didn&#146;t scowl or complain, as others would have. 
He just smiled. Especially when a bit of blood slid out of the corner of 
his mouth. Yoko was finally acting seriously. She tricked him into 
thinking that she would punch him, but in truth, she was infusing Chi 
into her other hand. So when he attempted to counter the incoming blow 
with a kick, he left himself open for that attack. Brilliant move. 

Xiangau pressed his palms into the ground and pushed upwards. He lifted 
his whole body up and stood straight, casting his eyes to Yoko. &#147;That 
was good. I&#146;m glad to see that you&#146;re taking this seriously now I 
suppose there is no longer a need to pull my punches.&#148;

Yoko grinned again. Her fighting spirit was finally boiling again. 
&#147;Don&#146;t feel that you need to hold back on my account, my friend.&#148;

Well, the gloves were off now. Literally. Xiangau worked his fingers 
into one glove on his hand. He pulled it off, and did the same with the 
other glove. He dropped them to the ground. But instead of falling 
lightly, they fell instantly. Once they hit the ground, they created a 
dent, breaking the stone of the arena. Yoko was inquisitive about their 
weight. Those gloves shouldn&#146;t have hit the ground that easily. Then she 
realized that they were heavy. Very heavy. 

&#147;He was wearing weighted gloves the whole time?&#148; She whispered. 

Xiangau rubbed his wrists. Now that those gloves were off, the speed of 
his punches was going to increase. But Yoko tried not to worry about it, 
rather, she took note of it and prepared for whatever Xiangau would do. 
The gold-eyed young man cracked his knuckles, and spread his arms out to 
either side of his body. He brought them down to his side, both hands 
each taking on a &#145;claw&#146; shape, snapping each of his knuckle and finger 
joints. While doing this, he took a deep breath, inhaling oxygen through 
the nose and exhaling through the mouth. His body was relaxed and loose, 
he appeared to be in synchronization with the flow of the universe. But 
that peace ended violently. Both of his hands blew up with his crimson 
red flames. They flickered that marvellous light before Yoko once more, 
and she knew what Xiangau intended to do. Or at least she thought she 
did. 

&#145;The Engisansei.. The technique that defeated Jun. But why would he 
power it up from there? He can&#146;t reach me from over there. He showed me 
the move just last night. Surely he doesn&#146;t think that I&#146;ve forgotten 
about it already?&#146;

&#147;Graaaaaaaaaah!&#148; Xiangau roared his beastly cry, as his Chi began to 
gush through his hands like water through ridges. The power of his 
energy ran up and down his body in streaks of red static, while the 
flames of his hands burned frantically. Once he was ready the attack 
began. His motions were artistically slow and smooth. Xiangau nudged his 
right shoulder forward, pulled back is flaming left hand and pushed the 
other one forward. 

&#147;Engisansei!&#148;

Yoko was alert. From instinct she jumped upwards into the air, but it 
was a good thing that she did. A fist shaped wave passed through the 
air. Though it seemed like a projectile, it was actually the shockwaves 
of the air that had been created through the brute power of the 
Engisansei&#146;s release. 

&#147;Engisansei!&#148;

Wham! Yoko coughed up saliva and blood as she was hit in the stomach, 
midair. She fell down to the ground, and wheezed. She could feel, almost 
instantly, that her ribs had been bruised. Yoko coughed again, and blood 
splattered against the floor. This time there was a lot more. 

Xiangau yelled out his attack again. &#147;Engisansei!&#148;

Yoko rolled over erratically, just about avoiding it. The third 
Engisansei smashed a hole into the soft stone of the ground. Chips of 
stone flew into the air, along with the dust that sprung up from it. 
Yoko rolled onto her back, still gripping her waist, and watched for 
Xiangau&#146;s next move. The older man vaulted into the air from his 
position across the arena, and thrust his open, flame-surrounded palm at 
Yoko once more. The Asagawa-girl rolled away again, as another small 
explosion rocked the ground beneath her. She scrambled to her feet and 
circled around a landing Xiangau, to get a better idea on how to attack. 
Xiangau&#146;s feet touched the floor, his hands still burning with those 
scarlet flames. Yoko breathed in and out, her heartbeat racing. Not only 
was her breathing sharp, but her ribs were still sore. That attack was 
brutal.

&#147;Wow,&#148; Yoko whispered. &#147;That move seems even more powerful from a 
distance. But it&#146;s a Chi-infusion ability, isn&#146;t it? He can&#146;t keep this 
up forever&#133;&#148;

Yoko saw Xiangau make more smooth hand movements. He was going to attack 
with the Engisansei again. Yoko ran for him. She had to get close enough 
to avoid the long-range version of the move. Otherwise she&#146;d be knocked 
out in a couple more hits. Xiangau finished the gestures made with his 
hands, then pushed his open left palm at the charging Yoko.

&#147;Engisansei!&#148; He bellowed magnificently.

During the run, Yoko edged to the right. She heard the sound of the air 
wave smashing one of the stone statues surrounding the arena. But she 
took no notice of it. She focused her dark marble eyes on Xiangau. The 
man screamed out his attack and thrust his opposite hand again, Yoko 
dodged that air wave from the right,  continuing her path forward. She 
tightened her right hand, and began gathering energy into it. She 
managed to get inside Xiangau&#146;s range, and was about to attack, until, 

&#147;Engisansei!&#148;

Yoko grit her teeth, blood surging from the gabs between them. She was 
too close to dodge such a surprise shot. It rammed her straight in the 
stomach. It tore open the lower half of her Gi, and revealed the 
plum-coloured bruise that had been inflicted. Yoko fell to her knees, 
gripping her stomach with one hand. Xiangau pulled his hand up, though 
the flame around it was losing brightness. He obviously could not keep 
this up. But it was enough, considering the situation. Yoko was on her 
knees before him, one more shot would probably end it. He drew back his 
right palm, and jabbed it downwards.

&#147;Engisansei-&#148;

&#147;Asagawa Fist!&#148;

Yoko left hand sprung from nowhere, brimming with orange-gold flames, to 
counter those of Xiangau&#146;s. The two fists collided, and the energy 
standoff between the two was colossal. Even Reinhalt, from his position 
outside of the ring, had to cover his eyes to keep from being blinded by 
the flash of vibrant colours The stone ground surrounding Yoko and 
Xiangau shattered and broke down in bits, clouds of dust rising up 
through the beams of light. Once all the smoke and dust has settled, the 
results were clear. The section of the arena they were fighting in had 
been smashed into a circular crater. Smoke rose up from it, a hunks of 
stone clattered to the surface like rain water. On one side of it was 
Yoko, her left hand twitching, her clothes charred and her heart beating 
wildly. She was still on her knees. On the other side of the two-metre 
long crater was Xiangau, who was standing, but weakened. His hands had 
lost their flames, and his breathing ragged 

Reinhalt looked over to them. He was actually impressed by their 
techniques. But he was much more pleased with the way the Stone Egg was 
glowing. The two fighters in the arena were ignorant of that fact. They 
were focused on each other and this match. And they were loving it. Both 
fighters looked at each other. Yoko&#146;s lips curled into a broad smile. 
Xiangau&#146;s followed the same idea, showing his enjoyment of this. For the 
first time, they had both been given a challenge that they could 
appreciate. 

They watched each other for those few moments, then lunged for one and 
other, crying out their passion with sharp battle roars. Once they met 
in the circled crater, a volley of blows was struck between the two of 
them, so fast and so sharp that only the keenest of eyes could make out 
what was being thrown. Yoko fiercely hurled a punch at Xiangau&#146;s face. 
He rapidly bobbed his head to one side, avoiding it. The thrashing power 
sliced open a cut at his shoulder, something he could not avoid. Xiangau 
reciprocated, thumping Yoko&#146;s innocent face with his raw, rending 
knuckles, opening a wound that would take weeks to heal He threw a 
second, that Yoko blocked, and she drew in her leg. It shot out seconds 
later, hitting Xiangau in the stomach. He skated back from Yoko, who 
went on the attack once more. She swung her leg around and brought it 
upwards, then down. Xiangau flashed to one side, like a leopard, 
avoiding the strike. Yoko&#146;s heel broke the stone of the arena, but she 
ignored the throbbing and searched for Xiangau. He came at her from the 
right, and he plunged his hand at her. Yoko was hit squarely in the 
shoulder, her body jerking back in kind. The silver-haired boy reared 
upwards and pounced, shooting his knee into Yoko&#146;s chest. She barely 
managed to block this, grabbing his legs in her hands and defending Once 
that threat was over, she growled and tackled Xiangau, wrapping her arms 
around his waist and tossing her body into him. They both fell to the 
floor, and Yoko pulled her hand back to punch his while Xiangau had his 
back to the floor. He caught the quick punch that followed, then grabbed 
the material of her Gi in bunches. He pulled, curling his leg under her, 
then rolled his body back  He released Yoko and used his leg to force 
her upwards. Yoko was thrown off of him, and into the air. The young 
woman span in the air, regaining control, then landed back down, her 
small feet skidding on the stone arena floor. Xiangau popped up 
instantly and attacked, landing a clear hit by punching Yoko straight 
across the face. Yoko scowled, batted Xiangau&#146;s hand away with the back 
of her own, then roundhouse kicked Xiangau at the side of his skull. 

The two recoiled from each other, slowly, staggering back, both fell to 
their knees, and took the time to breathe. Yoko looked over at Xiangau. 
His breathing was hard, his face running with sweat, and more than a few 
cuts had been inflicted. She imagined that she looked very much like 
that too. They both waited in their squatting postures for as long as 
the other would. The first to move was Yoko, but was quickly followed by 
Xiangau. They both got up to their feet, stood their ground, and brought 
up their guards. This conflict was proving to be more tightly matched 
than either of them might have believed. But their were still aces in 
the holes. Xiangau watched for Yoko&#146;s next move, and began thinking.

&#145;She is probably tired from this.&#146; He deliberated &#145;She is bound to be 
weaker and slower due to this fight&#133; that gives me a opportunity&#133; that I 
may need in order to win this.&#146;   

Xiangau drew in breath, calming himself, then gently released it. He 
eased himself, then gripped his fists together. Yoko watched him as he 
spread his arms out to either side of his now quiet body. His knuckles 
cracked rhythmically, and the soles of his black shoes held tightly to 
the ground. He focused himself, and it was clear to all that he was 
beginning something. Both arms began shaking, and thick veins in popped 
up all over his body, signifying the severity of the move he was about 
to do. Yoko got worried. She could feel that Xiangau was tapping into 
his Chi again. She had to stop him before he completed the preparations 
for his attack. She ran forwards, straight for him. Xiangau smiled. Yoko 
had taken the bait. He opened both his hands and held his hands in 
knife-hand like positions. With Yoko in his sights, he swung both arms 
back, then forward, screaming, 

&#147;Shinkoku Hakirute!&#148; 

Yoko tried desperately to stop running and avoid. But it was too late. 
The wave of warped air surged through in her path of fire and nailed her 
dead on. Yoko was blown back with a throttling jerk, her head suddenly 
flung back and blood spewing from her mouth. It was too much. Too much 
to avoid and too much to defend against. At least in her condition. 
Yoko&#146;s moving body fell to the arena floor and skidded until she was 
launched out of it. Yoko landed in a clump at the end of the ring, on 
the outside. 

&#147;Hu, hu, hu, hu&#133;&#148; Xiangau&#146;s breathing was drawn and destabilized. &#147;You 
were weakening So I lured you out with the Shinkoku Hakirute (Serious 
Wave Cutting Hand). But by running towards me, you assured that the blow 
would hit you&#133; and so&#133; I win&#133;&#148;

&#147;Correct!&#148; Reinhalt said from his throne. &#147;Yoko Asagawa has been ejected 
from the arena. You are the winner, Xiangau. You are the proclaimed God 
of Fighting!&#148;

Xiangau didn&#146;t even listen to Reinhalt properly. All he was concerned 
with was how Yoko was doing. He slowly began walking towards the place 
from which Yoko had been knocked off, that was until he noticed the 
Stone Egg by Reinhalt. It was glowing gold. It was actually glowing. And 
he was rightfully suspicious of it. But when Xiangau cast his eyes at 
it&#133; he felt odd&#133; this object, he could feel power swelling inside it, 
scratching and clawing to get loose. The force was elegant and peaceful, 
yet somehow, at the same time, it felt primal&#133; and ancient. Xiangau was 
somehow drawn to it. Like the Stone Egg itself was a part of his life. 

Reinhalt smiled at Xiangau&#146;s attraction to the Stone Egg. &#147;So&#133; you&#146;ve 
finally noticed, have you? Well, I cannot say that I am surprised. Not 
only is this Stone Egg a part of your legacy, it is now awake&#133; thanks to 
you&#133;&#148;

&#147;What are you talking about?&#148; Xiangau asked.

&#147;How soon youngsters today forget their past. But then, that is what you 
wanted to know about when you entered this tournament, wasn&#146;t it? About 
your past? About where your fighting style comes from? Where *you* come 
from?&#148;

&#147;H-How&#133;?&#148; Xiangau was shocked &#147;How do you know all this?&#148;

&#147;The peculiar man?&#148; Reinhalt offered. &#147;The one who handed you the 
tournament invite? That was an&#133;&#145;associate&#146; of mine, who had taken in 
interest in you. But all for the better. To think that a Child of Gaia 
was existing in Nagoya without me knowing about it&#133;&#148;

Now, that *really* was confusing. &#147;Child of Gaia? What is that? Explain 
yourself!&#148;

&#147;Very well,&#148; Reinhalt stood from his throne and began walking toward the 
arena as he spoke. &#147;Long ago, in ancient times, there existed a very 
unique tribe called the Enjima. They were highly advanced considering 
their time in history. It is said that they were so far ahead of the 
rest of the world in knowledge at that time, that they would have been 
considered more educated than the finest scholars of the 17th century. 
They are the greatest ancestors of the Ainu, the truest race of Japan. 
But rather than turn to the world to spread their gifts, they were 
isolated. But this isolation served them well. They grew connections to 
the very soil of the earth. Though logical, they were also spiritual 
people who dedicated their lives to the protection of this planet. For 
this reason, they fine-tuned themselves and their souls by creating a 
martial art. So deadly and so powerful, that the Enjima tribe taught it 
only to the members of their ranks. This fighting style was called 
&#145;Pillar of Gaia&#146;. It is the fighting style that you possess.&#148;

&#147;Pillar of Gaia&#133;?&#148; Xiangau looked blankly at Reinhalt as he stepped into 
the arena. &#147;This is the art I have been fighting with all these years?&#148;

Reinhalt stopped walking when in entered the edge of the arena. &#147;You are 
the only man left on the face of the earth who can use this style. Not 
even my greatest Historical researchers know of it. Only you can use 
Pillar of Gaia, and I am one of the few that know of it. The influence 
of the Enjima was vast within their own people. But they were ultimately 
isolated from all others. And that proved to be their downfall. They 
were distrusted by other Ainu tribes, and were eventually driven out of 
Japan. They migrated to Mainland Asia, and then Eastern Europe. But no 
matter where they went, they were met with fear, disdain and prejudice. 
Then, a great European warlord learned that the drifting Enjima were 
heading into his territory. He organized their mass murder. He 
ruthlessly set the swords of his army against the 200 members of the 
Enjima tribe&#133; and only six of them survived. But, their powers did not 
fade with their deaths. The power of the Enjima lived! It took on the 
form of Chi, swirling with power and burning with hatred. Hatred for 
years of mistreatment and abuse. This Chi became one giant force called 
GAIA. The six remaining members of the Enjima tribe saw the power of 
Gaia, and the damage it could do to the world. They sealed it inside a 
stone, and the remaining members of the Enjima tribe split apart, 
casting aside their powers. Only one man remained to protect that stone, 
he is the ancestor of the Chinese woman you saw in the semi-finals.&#148;

&#145;Li Ming?&#146; Xiangau thought.

Reinhalt continued. &#147;It was believed that the remaining Enjima vanished 
off the face of the earth at that point. But when my scientific team 
unearthed a scroll that documented the legacy of the Enjima, I knew that 
the remaining six had to have survived to pass on their genes to future 
generations. I made it a personal quest to find the descendants of the 
Enjima. And I have discovered them There are eight people left in the 
world with Enjima blood. You, Yoko Asagawa, and Li Ming, are all 
descendants of the Enjima.&#148;

&#147;My god!&#148; Xiangau was gob smacked. &#147;I am a descendant of an ancient Ainu 
tribe?&#148;

Reinhalt nodded. &#147;You are. My interest in your people grew. And when I 
learned of the stone that houses the great powers of Gaia, I searched 
and searched for it. And I found it. It had been traded throughout the 
villages of Africa as an ornament for thousands of years until it was 
entombed in monument called Tswana Rock. I had my KAIGA Group excavate 
it and bring it here&#133; that stone Gaia had been sealed in was the Stone 
Egg.&#148;

&#147;But why? You said that the Power of Gaia was dangerous. It was sealed 
inside that rock for a reason. Besides, what makes you think you can 
free it?&#148;

&#147;I have a theory. If I can bathe the Stone Egg in natural energies 
produced by the eight residual Enjima, I think the great power of Gaia 
can be freed! Look at the Stone Egg. It is already glowing, due to your 
battle with Yoko. All it needs is a little more power&#133; and then I am 
sure that Gaia will grace us with its presence.&#148;

Xiangau was thrown for a loop. But somehow, it all stuck. It explained 
things. Like why Reinhalt would need to watch this fight personally. Or 
why he, Yoko and Li Ming were invited here, even though they were not 
well known martial artists. It was all a plan. A plan by Reinhalt to 
seize some ancient power. Even though Xiangau was getting answers to 
some of his greatest questions,  he could not allow this to continue. If 
what Reinhalt was saying was true, then the Enjima souls that were 
trapped inside the Stone Egg needed to remain sealed forever. Strength 
born from discontent was worthless. It led only to bloodshed and even 
more unhappiness.

Xiangau looked over at Reinhalt. &#147;What do you intend to do with this 
Gaia force?&#148;

&#147;Nothing. In truth, it has little meaning to me. But there is one man in 
this world who lusts for the Stone Egg and the strength burning inside 
it. In exchange for the revitalized Stone Egg, he has promised me 
limitless riches!&#148;

&#147;Money?&#148; Xiangau barked. &#147;You&#146;d go through all of this just for 
meaningless scraps of paper? You are a ridiculous man. And I won&#146;t allow 
this. If you had any sense, you would destroy that stone before it 
unleashes something the world may regret seeing.&#148;

Reinhalt crossed his arms. &#147;Sorry. That&#146;s not up to me.&#148;

&#147;Stand aside!&#148; Xiangau clutched his fists. &#147;If you are too cowardly to 
take the initiative then I will!&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll have to get past me to do that&#133;&#148;

Xiangau was already running towards Reinhalt when he said that. He 
really, really didn&#146;t want to hurt anyone without having a good enough 
excuse, but Reinhalt was asking for it. If he didn&#146;t have the sense to 
destroy the Stone Egg, then Xiangau would do it. The silver-haired boy 
drew back his hand to strike, but gasped the second he did. Reinhalt 
sidestepped Xiangau and moved to the left. Xiangau stopped in his 
stride. He was quite rightly surprised. This man was a fighter. But that 
was strange, because Xiangau could sense no fighting aura from him. What 
could that have meant? Well, it didn&#146;t matter What mattered was getting 
him out of the way so he could smash the Stone Egg. Xiangau cracked the 
knuckles of his right hand, then gripped it into a lightly held fist. As 
before, he brought his hand into the air and brought it down to his 
face, where he focused all the motion and initiative in his body, 
centring it all on one spot. Xiangau pulled his hand back, swinging it 
around the right of his torso, then back around, yelling boldly,

&#147;Hakirute!&#148;

Reinhalt smiled at the burst of distorted air passing towards him in 
waves. He drew back his hand (the other in his pocket) then slapped the 
Hakirute away, with one swaying movement. Xiangau looked on, still 
surprised. He knew that he was running low on steam, Yoko had really 
taken it to him. But Reinhalt should not have been able to do that, no 
matter how tired Xiangau was feeling. This man was not to be 
underestimated 

&#147;You forget,&#148; Reinhalt began, &#147;I was watching your fight with the 
Asagawa girl. I have seen your techniques in action. There is no point 
in resisting me. But, if you choose to, let me show you the force you 
will be up against&#133;&#148;

Reinhalt grinned, separating his feet and legs. He crouched down, 
bending at the knees. While doing this, he turned his right shoulder to 
the left, casting his back to Xiangau Though he did not stop looking 
forward. His hands came within inch-distance of each other. All was 
quiet at first, till a whooshing sound filled the arena. It was slow and 
low in tone at first, the grew to enormous proportions all too soon 
Xiangau looked around and saw the winds pick up. The dust of the stone 
floor, was being blown in all directions, and the howling winds tore 
through the loose statues surrounding. Reinhalt was enveloped in 
mountainous flames of Chi, and for the first time, Xiangau felt his 
aura. He was radically strong. And the moment Xiangau felt this, he knew 
that in his present condition, he didn&#146;t stand a chance. Between 
Reinhalt&#146;s hands was now a twirling ball of dazzling crystal blue 
energy. The air around him became frosty and cold, and his body began 
twinkling with the bright sparks of frosty energy that was laying 
dormant within him. A grin spread over Reinhalt&#146;s face, and his body 
turned forwards, propelling both arms forward with open hands. 

&#147;Kreuzigung Flare!!&#148; 

Xiangau was instantly knocked senseless by the icy wave of power that 
overwhelmed him&#133;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&#147;Uggghhh&#133; man, my head aches&#133;&#148;

Yoko shook her head once to get rid of the cobwebs. She was on the floor 
outside of the ring And she realized it. The Asagawa girl ran a hand 
through her hair and sighed. Xiangau had beaten her. He really was an 
incredible man. But how long had she been out? Yoko stood up, then 
looked over at the arena surface. Xiangau was there. But he wasn&#146;t 
moving. 

&#147;Xiangau!&#148; Yoko vaulted onto the stone platform and ran over to her 
newest rival. She crouched down to see what was wrong. Holding a hand to 
his neck, she felt a pulse, and he was breathing thankfully. But who or 
what could have done this to him? At that point, Yoko looked over the 
thrown that Reinhalt had been sitting on. He was gone. Along with the 
egg shaped object that had been next to him. Yoko was confused. What on 
earth could have happened here? Yoko turned Xiangau over to his back, 
and waited for him to regain consciousness But when he did, he only had 
the power to mumble a few words.

&#147;&#133;G-Gaia&#133; R-Reinhalt&#133; D-Danger&#133;&#148;

Yoko had no idea what she was hearing. But what she did know was that 
she had to get Xiangau to the safety of the Kakuri Isle complex. If she 
had any idea of what had done this to him she would have thought better 
of it, but she didn&#146;t. Nor did she know that she had been impelled into 
plot by an unknown higher power&#133; with portentous intentions.
