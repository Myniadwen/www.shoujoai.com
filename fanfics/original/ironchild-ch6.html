<h1>Tokyo Iron Child Akari (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/ironchild-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Queen Sagi kept her eyes on Omega as the young man struggled breath into 
himself. Even though his incredible Mobile Shell hid the extent of his 
wounds from view, it was more than obvious that he was mortally wounded. 
If he wasn&#39;t wearing the Mobile Shell, Omega would probably have bled do 
death already. His limbs shook and his head bobbed up and down, 
gathering in as much oxygen as he possibly could. But, he stood beside 
his queen, like a true knight, to the bitter end. Sagi could not hide 
the pride and flattery she felt from knowing that Shigure held her life 
above his own. But she could also not hide the fear and worry she was 
carrying about Omega.

Omega was kneeling parallel to Queen Sagi, his spear at the ready, his 
eyes fixed on the door ahead of them. But Queen Sagi&#39;s eyes were on her 
valiant knight. 

&quot;Shigure.&quot; She said, sweetly. &quot;I greatly appreciate your protection of 
me. But I think you should go to one of the medical facilities to be 
treated.&quot;

Omega shook his head. &quot;I am sorry to disobey one of your orders, my 
queen, but I cannot leave your side. I have sworn myself to your 
protection until my death. I have to guard you until the very end of my 
life, with all that I have.&quot;

&quot;I understand-oof!&quot;

Both Omega and Queen Sagi were knocked off their feet as a trembling 
rumble spread through the AGIST. The people and workers at the lower 
levels all screamed and shouted, while the soldiers and scientists on 
the upper levels clung to the scenery for dear life. Queen Sagi fell to 
the floor abruptly, and Omega saw this with deep concern. He dropped his 
spear and ran to her side instantly, picking the weak-hearted woman up 
in a respectful grip. 

&quot;My queen!&quot; Omega yelled. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

Queen Sagi opened her eyes. &quot;Shigure... Garuda is here.&quot;

&quot;You can see this already?&quot;

Just then, the COM link button on Omega&#39;s helmet began to react. It 
flashed the colour red, which meant that someone was trying to contact 
him. Omega tapped the button, opening the COM link between himself and 
whoever was calling him. It turned out to be one of the soldiers 
positioned on the roof of the AGIST.

&quot;Yoshizuki?&quot; Omega questioned. &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Garuda, sir! The Garuda Mobile Shell has attacked the fifth floor! What 
should we do? How should we handle this situation now, sir?&quot;

Omega growled. &quot;Deploy all of the marionette units that you told me 
about. I want Garuda driven away from the AGIST. I will join with the 
troops as soon as I can.&quot;

**********

Garuda stamped his horseshoes down hard on the pavement. Each time he 
did he created a new print, 1/2 a metre deep and 2 &amp; 1/4 metres long. 
Cracks split off from the prints, breaking into the pavement then up the 
walls of the AGIST. The businessmen and businesswomen working and 
operating inside the building all screamed in terror as they saw the 
stomping legs of Garuda from the windows and entrances. One stomp of his 
leg blew open the doors to the force of the wind resistance. The people 
inside ran for &#39;safety&#39; from the blocked doorway, but they were unaware 
of the fact that none of them were safe around Garuda. 

Garuda opened his palm and fired at the upper floors, the ones too high 
up for him to reach. His palm blasters tore through the building&#39;s wall 
like it was made of paper, the bulletproof glass panes shattering as 
easily as regular glass would.  

Shards of the glass flew into the 17th floor offices and hailed down on 
the people inside. Those who were fortunate enough to escape could only 
debate on their next move, as Garuda continued to attack the AGIST. 
Though it seemed that this attack was just a coincidence, Garuda had 
planned to come here. For what purpose, that was unknown, but this 
assault was not taken on an impulse like the rest of the destruction had 
been. 

Just at that moment, behind the AGIST main building, there was a back 
street that was cut off from the rest of the street surrounding the 
headquarters. It seemed unusual to be there, and it was. A large section 
of the road, about 15 by 25 metres long, disjointed from the rest and 
rose up by two linking steel poles. This revealed a flight of stairs, 
leading downwards, and up from this area came the Asuka Group&#39;s most 
prized marionettes, the Hayate models. Almost twice the size of a 
regular marionette and armed with light grade-B hand lasers, the 
soulless machines rose up from the depths of hell to do battle. Each one 
followed after the other, marching towards the gigantic metal gate 
blocking this road from the main one. It opened slowly as they reached 
it, and they strode past, all walking after the one in front. They 
walked around the large building into clear view, under the enormous 
shadow of Garuda. The fifteen-man unit of Hayate models all lined up 
after each other, then spread out, so they formed a line of offence the 
stretched as far as their number would allow.
 
The leader drone commanded the assault. &quot;ALL UNITS. READY. AIM. FIRE.&quot;

A wave of laser fire cut through the air and shot upwards at the looming 
Garuda, and hit its target with almost flawless aim. These blasts simply 
bounced off of Garuda&#39;s body, destroying more of the lower levels of the 
AGIST. Still they did not stop firing, they continued to fire and fire, 
all fifteen units combining their fire. Seconds later, the leader drone 
of the Hayate units stopped firing.

&quot;CEASE FIRE.&quot; It said in its robotic voice. 

The other fourteen Hayate units stopped firing and lowered their laser 
cannons. Through all that, they till could not damage the hide of that 
monstrous Garuda. Garuda had barely even noticed that those Hayate 
marionettes had been firing at it, and stopped attacking the AGIST only 
when it saw them, lined up and armed ready to fire again. 

&quot;RRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGH!&quot;

Garuda trotted over to them, around the slightly blocking edge of the 
AGIST main building. The Hayate marionettes did not react, while Garuda 
began its attack. The beast swung its fist in a hook-like form, dragging 
the metal across the stone pavement. One of the marionettes took the 
blow and was destroyed instantly, the ensuing explosion blowing up two 
more of the surrounding marionettes. The leader marionette was unharmed, 
so issued more commands for its troops to follow.

&quot;ALL REMAINING UNITS,&quot; The leader began. &quot;ENTER FREE FIRE DEFENCE MODE.&quot;

Each of the marionette units entered Free Fire Defence Mode (FFD-mode), 
which was a free for all system of attack, to fire at while. The Hayate 
units all fired as they chose from their combat data, some firing at the 
legs in the hopes of paralysing the Garuda, some shooting the chest so 
that they might destroy the Hyper Beam orb that was below it. Garuda 
resisted all attempts on its life, and counter-attacked, smashing his 
fists into them. The Hayate units were not built for hi-speed combat, so 
they lacked the speed of their older brothers, the regular marionettes. 
This made them unable resist or dodge Garuda&#39;s punches. 

One was knocked inside the AGIST, so hard that exploded inside, killing 
the people inside immediately. Garuda stomped the ones shooting at his 
legs, flattening those units under the force of its Kowa-steel 
horseshoes. The explosions were compressed by the weight of the Garuda&#39;s 
legs, and even so they left not so much as a scratch on the shining 
silvery sheen that the Garuda possessed. The last few units, Garuda 
destroyed with little effort, hot fire surging up from the ruins of 
their metallic corpses.

High above that scene, up on the roof of the AGIST, was Omega, standing 
on the edge, looking down towards the image of the rampaging Garuda, 
below the blazing heat of the sun. Though his stump of an arm was 
bleeding profusely, and his Mobile Shell damaged in the battle with 
Chimaera, he still stood proud, his weak legs staying in balance by the 
power of his stern resolve. 

Omega gripped his spear tight, as he watched Garuda way down below. 
&quot;Strength comes from having something to protect. As long as Queen Sagi 
is in need of protection, I cannot be beaten.&quot;

Mumbling those reassuring words to himself, Omega dove over the edge of 
the AGIST and threw himself down towards Garuda. As he jetted downwards, 
his scanners observed the destruction caused by the Garuda&#39;s offensive. 
Had anyone else attempted this, they would have found themselves in very 
hot water. Now Garuda had done this and the Asuka Group could barely 
cope. How could such a monster have been created by technology of this 
area? 

&quot;No matter.&quot; Omega said to himself as he descended. &quot;Its not my concern 
anymore.&quot;

Though the fall took a while due to the absurd height of the AGIST, 
Omega began to get closer to Garuda. As he noticed this, the Asuka 
Group&#39;s commander altered his position so that he fell feet first, and 
span his spear into an attacking position. Then, as soon as he was able, 
he struck the Garuda&#39;s larger head, slashing at its skull with his 
spear, the one-armed slash weaker than before. Garuda roared once more 
and punched the far smaller Omega, knocking him down to the ground. 

&quot;Guh!&quot; Omega collided with the stone of the pavement, sliding to a stop 
as his body rammed into a lamppost. He coughed hard, blood splattering 
against the inside of his visor, along with his spittle. Garuda&#39;s 
punches were like claps of thunder. But what could you expect when each 
of its knuckles were the size of wrecking balls?

Omega thrust his spear into the ground, and struggled to drag himself 
upward, using the spear&#39;s length as a tool for stability. It was 
surprisingly hard to get up from the floor when you only had one arm. He 
managed to get the job done, then ripped his spear back out of the dent 
made in the ground. Garuda seemed to be sneering at him, its ponytail 
mop of hair swaying back and forth in the wind. But Omega could not be 
intimidated now. Not with Queen Sagi relying on him. The commander 
calmed himself, and then fell still. Energy began to emanate from the 
blade of his spear, a bright gold, contrasting the dark green of his 
Mobile Shell. When he felt that the energy was strong enough, Omega 
jumped into the air, the force of his leap accelerated by the thrusters 
of his legs.

He drew his arm back, and sailed so high that he was hovering above the 
back of horse section of Garuda&#39;s body. As he descended, he branched the 
energy charged spear and swung it around and over his body, screaming 
passionately,

&quot;Asuka Group special technique! Kin&#39;irozan!&quot;

A bright flash of golden energy brightened up the surrounding 
atmosphere, like lightning in the dusk. The slash attack struck the 
silver hide of the Garuda, Omega himself partially unable to gaze at the 
strong light emitted. The commander smiled behind his visor as he heard 
something break, and jumped back to see the results. Omega landed on the 
nearby pavement, his feet sliding and stopping in the following seconds. 
When he looked up at Garuda and saw no damage, this confused him; after 
all he heard something break. It didn&#39;t take him long to realize just 
what had broken though. Omega was dumbstruck to see that the blade of 
his spear had broken in half. All that was left was a jagged remainder, 
no more slashing techniques were possible with it now. 

Garuda didn&#39;t wait for Omega to acclimate himself, and attacked, 
punching the bewildered Omega with stern potency. Omega yelled out, as 
he was smashed into the lowest wall of the AGIST, and fell back to the 
ground with a slap. Pebbles of rumble clattered against his suit, from 
the large dent that had been created in the wall. Blood splattered 
against the floor again, but this time not from Omega&#39;s shoulder. It 
came from the core of his waist. That punch had broken open his armour, 
and shards of him armour had cut him open. 
   
Omega&#39;s struggling; weak and trembling body did not give up, though. You 
could call it foolishness, you could call it moronic, but the second in 
command of the Asuka Group was not going to give up, not now, not ever. 
Once again, Omega (who still managed to hold on to his spear) edged up 
by the strength left in his knees. He thrust his broken spear into the 
ground again, and stood upright, slowly but definitely, until he felt 
confident enough to stand without the leverage of his spear. Now that he 
was upright, Omega pulled his weapon up and spun it around in a display 
of defiance, then drew it backwards, like a javelin. 

Using all of his might, Omega hurled the spear at Garuda with his one 
arm, hoping to at least do some damage with that. No such luck. Garuda 
grabbed the spear in his hand, without any stress. Though the spear was 
a little less than two metres long, it looked like a toothpick in 
Garuda&#39;s large hand. Omega could only glare and curse. He was out of 
luck. His visor readings indicated that he had about 20.5% of his core 
energy left. It was less than a quarter of the full amount but enough to 
get the job done. One Hyper Blast, Omega was sure that could do the 
trick. When Garuda saw that Omega wasn&#39;t going to attack outright, it 
reacted angrily, and extended his right arm, opening his palm and 
revealing that orb in it. Omega couldn&#39;t really run very fast now, so 
tried to activate his thrusters. 

Nothing happened. &quot;What the?&quot;     

The thrusters had been damaged in the blow from knocking against the 
wall. Which meant that he was virtually incapable of avoiding anything 
Garuda threw his way. Which was exactly what was about to happened. 
Omega could only shield his visor with his remaining as Garuda fired. 
The mechanical creature blasted the queen&#39;s knight, gunning him down 
like a fox in hunting season. Soon Omega could not be seen for dust, 
just the clouds of smoke and dust that appeared as he (and the wall of 
the AGIST) was blown into submission by the rapid shots of Garuda&#39;s palm 
blasters. Stray bricks, broken glass and scraps of metal fell from above 
and rained down on what was left of Omega, enhancing the smog-like cloud 
of dust that piled up along with it.

Garuda stopped firing after three minutes of ruthless fire, and lowered 
his arm. It was about to continue its destruction of the AGIST, assuming 
that Omega was killed. But, defying all logic, a hand burst up from the 
rubble. This hand was severely damaged, but indicated that Omega was 
alive. The man dragged himself out of the rubble, his suit covered in 
blood, some sections of his natural body showing through. Garuda&#39;s 
simulating program couldn&#39;t come up with an explanation for that. The 
pilot should have been killed. Omega fell back on top of that pile, even 
though managed to claw himself out. He couldn&#39;t even bring himself to 
stand on two legs. 

&quot;H-Having... something to protect...&quot; Omega fumbled to say. &quot;B-Brings... 
you s-strength....&quot;

The breastplate of the Omega Mobile Shell broke open, the dark green 
material shattering to reveal that glowing central orb again. Omega 
watched the superior Garuda, his visor broken open, his face covered in 
blood, his right eye burnt right out of its socket      . 

&quot;Y-You have... nothing to p-protect... you only destroy... t-that makes 
you weak...&quot; Omega growled loudly, best as he could. &quot;And the destiny of 
the weak is to be defeated!&quot;

Garuda didn&#39;t run or hide. He knew what was coming. The titanic monster 
pulled back the hand that was holding Omega&#39;s spear, then threw it back 
at him. The spear cut straight through the air, into the orb at Omega&#39;s 
chest and through his body, reappearing at his back. And it all happened 
in the blink of an eye. Fragile tears leaked from Shigure&#39;s eyes as his 
started to see black, in the end, this is what it all came down to. His 
years of service under his queen ended on this day. 

&quot;Queen Sagi...&quot; Omega thought, his eyes closing. &quot;I have failed you. 
Please forgive me.&quot;

Omega feel dead at the hands of Garuda. The orb at his chest was still 
charging, and due to the spear that had been thrown through it, the 
reaction was unstable. The vast energies inside that orb became volatile 
and the outcome was a massive explosion of golden light. Shigure Kagami 
and his Omega Mobile Shell were blown to bits, now nothing more than 
scraps of a memory. Garuda bellowed at his victory, pounding his chest 
repeatedly.

 &quot;GHAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHH!!&quot;

Up on the roof of the AGIST, the soldiers who served Shigure held back 
their tears. Their loyal, trustworthy commander had fallen to the 
Garuda, and there was nothing they could do about it. One of those 
soldiers, Yoshizuki, laid his handgun to rest on the floor as a sigh of 
respect, and saluted the sky.

&quot;Farewell, commander Kagami.&quot; He said. &quot;You&#39;ll be missed, sir.&quot;

One of the other soldiers looked over the edge of the building, looking 
down at the scene below. &quot;Hey, lieutenant Yoshizuki! Look down there! 
It&#39;s the Garuda!&quot;

Yoshizuki ran over to the edge and looked down. Garuda was big enough 
for them to see it, even all the way up there. The beast was yelling its 
usual nonsense, but strangely, it began to back away from the AGIST and 
gallop further down the road, moving on to another area. Yoshizuki 
looked up with a concerned look on his face. 

&quot;Wasn&#39;t it trying to destroy the AGIST?&quot; He asked his fellow allies. 
&quot;Why did it just run away like that?&quot;

One of the other soldiers began to raise a point. &quot;Lieutenant... you 
don&#39;t think...?&quot;

&quot;Think what?&quot;

&quot;Well... that maybe the Garuda his hunting down the active Mobile 
Shells, do you?&quot;

Yoshizuki thought that over. &quot;That would make sense. But why? What would 
it have to gain? The other Mobile Shells are the only weapons that stand 
a chance against it.&quot;

The soldier looking over the edge questioned that. &quot;Does anything stand 
a chance against something like that? Even commander Kagami was killed 
by that thing, while he was wearing his Mobile Shell.&quot;

&quot;Well, nevertheless,&quot; Yoshizuki began. &quot;As commander Kagami&#39;s second, 
I&#39;m taking control of this situation. I want Queen Sagi&#39;s room guarded 
with as many soldiers as possible! We will then come up with some sort 
of plan to deal with Garuda. Be on full alert!&quot; 

The soldiers all saluted and acknowledged lieutenant Yoshizuki&#39;s 
request, and were about to split up to carry out that command, but were 
more concerned with the wind that was picking up around them. Their 
combat jackets were all ruffled up, and their hats blown off, and this 
wind did not seem natural. When Yoshizuki heard the distinct sound of 
spinning blades, he looked up in the sky, and saw a large helicopter 
descending towards one of the four yellow heli-pads painted on the roof. 

One of the soldiers spoke. &quot;Have we given permission for anyone to land 
here?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Yoshizuki said, suspicion in his voice. &quot;Ready your guns, men.&quot;

The soldiers all did as they were asked, and lifted their laser cannons 
into firing position as the jet-black helicopter began to land on the 
pad. The blades stopped spinning gradually, and the door leading inside 
opened swiftly, clashing against the stone of the floor. The soldiers of 
the Asuka Group were ready to fire, but automatically lowered their guns 
when they saw who came out of the helicopter, two bodyguards beside him. 
The man was of average height, short black hair, wearing a set of 
glasses and dressed in a dark black suit. Lieutenant Yoshizuki gasped as 
the man spoke.

&quot;Why, gentlemen.&quot; He said with a smirk. &quot;I hope those aren&#39;t for me.&quot;

Yoshizuki lowered his own laser gun. &quot;President Minakami...&quot;

**********

Queen Sagi lowered her face, the bangs of her hair hiding the shame and 
tears in her face. She had seen the whole thing through the security 
cameras stationed at the outer walls of the AGIST. Shigure had fought so 
bravely, so valiantly, but died in battle with the Garuda. She knew the 
destruction was coming, she had foreseen it a long time ago, but she was 
still unprepared for the shock of all this pain and mayhem, so much 
killing and violence. Why did she ever allow the Garuda to exist in 
Hidden Vault? She should have destroyed it when she had the chance, 
before it could ever be allowed to be piloted by anyone, Neganas or not. 
Now the options were running out and time was running thin. Garuda was 
unstoppable and nothing could change it. Now Queen Sagi really began to 
regret giving Kagome the Silhouette Mobile Shell. In the end, all 
weapons and tactics used on the Garuda had been worthless in comparison. 
Now it looked like the only thing anyone could do was wait for death. 

&quot;This is all my fault...&quot; Queen Sagi said reprimanding herself. &quot;I 
should have listened to you, Asuka.&quot;

&quot;Still have your head in the clouds, eh?&quot; 

Queen Sagi looked upwards. Someone was calling her. But when she saw the 
man who was doing this, she could hardly believe her eyes. &quot;Kazuma 
Minakami?&quot;

Minakami smiled. &quot;Sagi Izubata. It&#39;s a pleasure to see you again. You 
look very well. How long has it been, three years or so?&quot;

&quot;Minakami.&quot; Sagi said. &quot;I know we haven&#39;t always agreed in the past, but 
now you must see the error of using Neganas the way you did. It has 
taken over the Garuda Mobile Shell. The most powerful weapon we have 
ever created! Have you seen the damage it has done? Think about what it 
could do if it was allowed to continue this rampage!&quot;

Minakami simply smiled. &quot;What exactly do you suggest we do?&quot;

&quot;We must pool all of our resources and assets in the hope of stopping 
Garuda. We cannot allow anymore people to die because of out mistakes!&quot;

&quot;Mistakes?&quot; Minakami said with fake-surprise. &quot;I admit that you have 
made some mistakes, but I have not. In fact, I should say that I have 
done very well up to now. It is only a matter of time before everything 
falls into place. At last the game pieces are finally in order.&quot;

Queen Sagi blinked. &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Did you really believe that we of the Japanese government we so na&iuml;ve 
that we could not see how the binding process of the Neganas weapon 
would effect this situation? And did you believe that we were so 
ignorant of our devises that we were unaware of the fact that you stole 
the Neganas sample?&quot;

&quot;What are you trying to say?&quot; Sagi yelled.

Minakami continued to smile. &quot;For a prophet, you really are quite slow, 
aren&#39;t you? Very well. You know as well as I do that after the failed 
assassination attempt on Minh Kou and the consequent war with Korea, the 
Japanese military&#39;s power was great exhausted. Due to your input, even 
countries outside of Asia are armed with advanced marionette units, 
making us vulnerable to everyone including one of our more powerful 
enemies, the United States. For a politician in my status, this just 
isn&#39;t acceptable. We needed a weapon that was capable of tipping the 
scale of world warfare in our favour.&quot;

Sagi&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;You aren&#39;t suggesting that...?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Minakami confirmed it. &quot;The weapon we wanted so badly was never 
really Neganas at all. It was the Garuda.&quot;

&quot;That can&#39;t be!&quot; Queen Sagi yelled. &quot;How did you even know about the 
Garuda in the first place?&quot;

&quot;Your father was the one who originally devised the Garuda&#39;s blueprints, 
wasn&#39;t he? You see, you may have many resources but the Asuka Group is 
still just a random company. The Izubata Company did not create the 
technology used to sustain your life; the government, in exchange for 
the blueprints to the Garuda Mobile Shell, created it. Of course, we 
didn&#39;t have the technology or manpower to produce our own Garuda back 
then. And even worse, was the strain it put on the pilots. For a normal 
human being to pilot it, there was an 87% chance of heart failure. We 
needed a pilot that was able to wield the Garuda and stay alive in the 
process. So when that Korean firm told us of the advances they had made 
in nano-technology, we knew what to expect.&quot;  
  
&quot;My father allowed you the blueprints...?&quot;

Minakami smirked. &quot;I suppose he felt some guilt from the way he used you 
in the original Mobile Shell project. The bonds of family are so easily 
broken by the desire for power.&quot;

Queen Sagi shook her head. &quot;But what good has it done you? The Garuda is 
still uncontrollable and it will sooner destroy you than take your 
orders!&quot;

In a second, Minakami went into his pocket, and fished out something. 
&quot;Do you know what this is?&quot;

&quot;That is...&quot; Sagi looked it over. &quot;A CFL chip.&quot;

Minakami put it back in his trouser pocket. &quot;Almost correct. It is CFL 
microprocessor. Slightly more advanced than a chip used to control 
marionettes. This small item has the power to override the Self-Defence 
program that automatically operates the Garuda when it is activated. And 
once we have it miniaturized, it will also act as a control mechanism 
for Neganas.&quot;

Queen Sagi gasped. &quot;You are insane! You are planning to mass-produce 
more of the Garuda!&quot;

&quot;Spot on.&quot; Minakami jabbed. &quot;We have collected enough data from the 
current test. In three weeks we will begin manufacturing hundreds of 
Garudas and an equal amount of Neganas to serve as pilots. With that 
kind of force in my hands, no military power in the world will stand a 
chance against me. Not even the combined forces of the UN.&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute.&quot; Sagi said. &quot;What do you mean by current test?&quot;
 
Minakami crossed his arms. &quot;The destruction Garuda is causing to Tokyo 
is not a random occurrence, or act of God. I have been planning it for 
the past two years. This is, in effect, a trial run of what to expect 
from the Garuda Army we are about to create, a sort of &#39;display&#39; of its 
power. The instinct that Neganas has to bond with Mobile Shells was not 
planned, I admit, but the result of its release was everything I had 
hoped for. Which is why we let you continue you experiments on Neganas 
even though you stole it from us.&quot;

For the first time in her life, Queen Sagi actually swore. &quot;You bastard. 
All the people killed today, all the people that Garuda will kill... you 
knew how it would react and you still allowed it to happen. The people 
you are supposed to be protecting. You let them die so you could see 
Garuda&#39;s power?!&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t be so dramatic with me.&quot; Minakami scowled. &quot;My actions are 
none of your concern. Besides how can you hold me to fault? I hear you 
used your own daughter in experiments with Neganas, just as your father 
used you in experiments with the Mobile Shells. I think there is a great 
irony in that, yes?&quot;

Sagi looked away. &quot;How dare you...?&quot;

&quot;The era of the Izubata Family is over, Sagi.&quot; Minakami said. &quot;As is the 
era of the Asuka Group. Once work begins on the Garuda Army, no one will 
be able to challenge the Japanese Regular Forces again. You should feel 
proud. Your research will help restore Japan into the superior fighting 
nation it had once been.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re forgetting one thing, Minakami!&quot;

The man smiled. &quot;What might that be?&quot;

&quot;You may have silenced the Japanese press about this, but the world will 
find out eventually. What will you do then? Everyone will know how you 
killed your own people in cold blood!&quot;

&quot;You see, that&#39;s where you&#39;re wrong. I didn&#39;t create Garuda. I wasn&#39;t 
the one holding Neganas at the time of its escape. That was you. You and 
the Asuka Group. Everything that has happened so far is a result of your 
actions, Sagi, not mine. All I&#39;ve done is take note of Garuda&#39;s great 
power. I may be a politician, but I am not a fool. And besides...&quot;

&quot;Besides what?&quot; Queen Sagi said angrily.

&quot;The current Garuda is of no more use to me.&quot; Minakami said. &quot;It needs 
to be eliminated.&quot;

Sagi grimaced. &quot;And just how do you plan on doing that?&quot;

&quot;There are far more powerful weapons in the world than Mobile Shells.&quot; 
There was a sinister and evil smile on Minakami&#39;s face as he said; &quot;I 
plan to use the Space Cannon on NOA3.&quot;

Sagi&#39;s heart was set on fire. &quot;You cannot do that! That cannon has a 
blast radius of 1.5 miles! You&#39;ll destroy Shinjuku in an instant if you 
use NOA3! I beg you, Minakami, even you cannot be so foolish as to cause 
that kind of destruction to Tokyo!&quot;

Minakami just began walking away, towards the door. &quot;Those who hold 
power have no need for morality, Sagi. All I need to be aware of is the 
path I will take to final victory. Once the cannon on NOA3 wipes out the 
Shinjuku district, you and the AGIST will be a distant memory, and the 
berserk Garuda will be out of the way. In approximately ten minutes, 
Sagi. You have ten minutes.&quot;

&quot;Do not do this!&quot; The woman screamed.

Minakami laughed as he exited the room. &quot;Please give Daigo my regards. 
Ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot;

Queen Sagi slumped to the ground in shock as all of this was opened to 
her eyes. Minakami and the government had been using her and the Asuka 
Group all along. And now he was going to commit an atrocity so 
horrifying that Sagi could barely conceive it. But even if there was no 
hope for her, she had to bring help to her child. Queen Sagi touched the 
temple of her head and tried as hard as her mind would allow, to make 
contact with Kagome. 

&quot;Kagome...&quot; She mumbled. &quot;I know you are still alive. Please answer 
me...&quot;

**********

&#39;Kagome....&#39;

&quot;Uggh...&quot; Silhouette groaned, then rolled over as best she could. Slowly 
her eyes got back onto focus, and she looked around her location. She 
was lying across the red carpet of an office building, surrounded by 
shards of glass and brick. Judging by the hole in the wall and the sheer 
size of it, Garuda had punched Silhouette straight through that wall. 
Still, she had no time to worry about herself, she had to check on Tokyo 
Blossom and make sure that the other woman was okay. Silhouette stood 
up, dusting her armour off, then ran to the hole in the wall to get back 
outside. But before she made it there, 

&#39;Kagome...&#39;

Silhouette blinked. She was actually hearing Queen Sagi&#39;s voice in her 
head. &quot;S-Sagi? What is-&quot;

&#39;I have been contacting you for the past five minutes. What happened?&#39;

&quot;Garuda happened.&quot; She responded. &quot;Why are you calling me like this?&quot;

&#39;I have not much time to explain, so just listen. Kazuma Minakami is 
behind all this madness. He has decided to use a VERY powerful space 
cannon on Garuda, which will subsequently destroy Shinjuku in the next 
five minutes. You have to get yourself and Akari out of there!&#39;

This was all a bit much to take in. &quot;B-But what should I do? There is no 
way we could get clear of Shinjuku so quickly. It would be impossible.&quot;

&#39;If you can&#39;t get clear of Shinjuku, go under it. Hidden Vault. If you 
access it the same way Garuda and the others escaped it, I am sure you 
can avoid the brunt of the blast. Please hurry!&#39;

Silhouette narrowed her eyes. &quot;But what about you?&quot;

&#39;My life is over, Kagome. It has been ever since Asuka died. The last 
gift I can give to you now is to tell you of a way to save your life. No 
matter about anything else, you are my daughter and I do love you. 
Please build the relationship with Akari that Asuka and I wanted to 
have, and I beg of you to please be happy. Goodbye.&#39;
 
&quot;Sagi!&quot; Too late. Whatever link there was between them, Queen Sagi 
blocked it. But if she couldn&#39;t save Sagi then Silhouette could at least 
fulfil the woman&#39;s wishes. Silhouette swiftly jumped out of the building 
Garuda had knocked her into, and observed the outside. Thankfully, Tokyo 
Blossom was okay. She stood up from the stoop she had been knocked into, 
and walked over in Silhouette&#39;s direction.  

&quot;Kagome.&quot; She said loudly. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Akari!&quot; Silhouette yelled. &quot;But we&#39;ve got to get out of here! 
Do you know where Garuda escaped Hidden Vault?&quot;

Tokyo Blossomed nodded, relaxingly moving her head and neck. &quot;Yeah, 
sure. But why exactly is that important? And what about Garuda?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll explain things on the way!&quot; Silhouette said. &quot;We have to go, now!&quot;

&quot;Okay, just follow me.&quot; Tokyo B slowly rose up off the ground as her 
thrusters opened up, and she then flew forwards. Silhouette commanded 
her suit to do the same for her, which it did, and she too was blasted 
off, following Tokyo Blossom was closely as possible. While the two 
flew, as fast as Silhouette said they needed to, Tokyo B began to 
address the situation.    

&quot;What&#39;s going on, Kagome?&quot; Tokyo Blossom asked. 

Silhouette kept her eyes forward. &quot;Queen Sagi just contacted me. She 
told me that someone named Kazuma Minakami is going to attack Tokyo with 
a space cannon. We must get clear of the blast!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom blinked behind her visor. So the entity that she spoke to 
in Tetsuko&#39;s mind was right. Minakami did have a hand in all this. By 
why would a politician like him get involved with something like Garuda? 
It was a boggling mystery to her, and that was for sure. 

&quot;So.&quot; Tokyo B said as they flew. &quot;What&#39;s the name of this cannon?&quot;

Silhouette tried to think. &quot;Um... NOA3.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Tokyo Blossom was incredulous. &quot;Are you serious?!?&quot;
 
Silhouette nodded, then gasped as Tokyo Blossom grabbed her hand 
violently. As soon as Tokyo B felt her grip was secure, she put extra 
force into her thrusters up re-routing some of the energy from the orb 
at her chest. She had never done that before and that was obvious, 
because the two girls were propelled three times faster than what they 
believed to be there top speed. While Tokyo Blossom dodged through 
buildings and roads to get even closer to the hole leading into Hidden 
Vault, Silhouette was beginning to question Tokyo Blossom&#39;s action.

&quot;Akari!&quot; Silhouette could barely speak because of the wind resistance. 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom looked back. &quot;Lets just say that NOA3&#39;s cannon is no joke! 
Just hang on!&quot;

Both girls zipped through each road and turn they could through the 
ruined and abandoned Shinjuku streets. They were getting closer and 
closer to the hole leading down into Hidden Vault, but the time they 
thought they has was just about to elapse. High above the city, high 
above Japan, high above the very clouds of atmosphere that surround the 
earth, was a gigantic space satellite called NOA3. One the underside of 
that satellite was a cannon, by the name of &#39;World Slayer&#39;, slowly began 
to move and shift positions inside its hull. The doors to the cannon 
slowly opened, no sound of it being heard in the nothingness of space. 
In time a huge long and thin cylinder, built from newly refined 
Kowa-steel, slipped through those open port doors. The cannon stopped 
move forward as it reached the end of its limits to extend, and waited 
for the command to fire. 

Inside the satellite, many people working for the government scrambled 
around and made things ready. Some of the kept questioning whether or 
not this was the right thing to do, others kept their mouths shut 
entirely. But they all made the preparations necessary to fire. Up on 
the bridge of the satellite, a man was informed that Minakami had gotten 
clear of the Shinjuku district by now.

&quot;Alright then!&quot; He responded. &quot;Fire the World Slayer!&quot;

Energy began gathering in the core of the satellite&#39;s power generator. 
This energy was transported to the systems and channels of the laser 
cannon using a very sophisticated process of power transferral. A strong 
white luminosity began to form inside the cannon, accompanied by the 
sound of something being &#39;awakened&#39;. Then, with a jolt so strong it 
rocked the satellite itself, the World Slayer was fired.

A gargantuan beam of pure white energy was released, so focussed and so 
compressed it looked like a gap between the doors of heaven. The beam 
cut straight through the atmosphere of space and that, which enfolded 
the earth with its vastness. The beam travelled downward to the earth, 
toward Asia, then narrowed in on Japan, to Tokyo, to Shinjuku and ended 
with the area that Garuda was presently occupying.  

The beam could be see for great distances around, but was felt by almost 
of the people living in Tokyo. A massive tremor rocked the entire city 
as the beam collided with Garuda. The ground shook like an earthquake 
was striking the city as one had done just a month ago, but those 
believed this were obviously false. Ethereal light filled the city and 
everything suddenly felt brighter, light of purification tearing apart 
everything and anything in its way. Buildings shook like dominoes. 
Glasses of drink that people had taken to ease their worries now 
shattered from the force of the vibrations that were rocking the city, 
along with the windows of the buildings that had been built up in recent 
years. 

From the blast point onwards, cracks began to form and split off into 
other areas of the city. The ground that was the focal point of the 
blast melted away like ice in summer, and the surrounding area began 
collapsing into itself, the shops, carts, houses, cars and the unlucky 
people who had not been evacuated, all coming down with it. It all 
plunged down further than the Tokyo subway; it went deeper, while the 
force of the beam continued to rip apart the ground level setting. 

The streaking cracks travelled along the grounds of the Shinjuku streets 
and spread from the blast point, like a disease reaching for new cells 
to infect. As those cracks continued on, more of the Shinjuku district 
began to cave in, dragging down the former hub of Tokyo life with it. 
The shops and homes that people had known all their lives began nothing, 
as it all sank inside the gigantic crater in the centre of the city, 
that was getting larger and larger every second that it was bombarded by 
the pure heavenly light of the World Slayer cannon. 

The force of the beam reached as far as Akari&#39;s old apartment, and the 
place where she worked, Tokyo Burger. All that had been created was 
being undone like in seconds, by the capacities of the energy beam. In a 
minute or to, the centre of Shinjuku was nothing more than a smoking 
crater that was still being violated by the NOA3 space cannon. The 
surrounding areas would have fallen to the same fate, but before more of 
the city centre capsized into itself, the explosion took centre stage. 
The beam ended and the following outburst of volatile white energy took 
on the shape of a gigantic sphere on the horizon. 

Even Ryoko, who had travelled to Shibuya long before Garuda was 
released, could see the light of the explosion through the window of her 
home. And she feared greatly for her safety. Closer to the massive orb 
that was stunning Tokyo was the AGIST, less than 50 meters from the 
blinding light of the energy sphere. Soldiers on the roof ran inside the 
building, people seeing the explosion tried to hide under desks and wait 
for it to pass, their ears ringing with the sound of the sonic waves 
shattering their building. But Queen Sagi, up in that cold lonely room 
on the 30th floor, knew better. She knew that there was nothing she 
could do to change her fate, or there&#39;s. 

It was a relief for her in so many ways. Now she could finally rest. 
Queen Sagi shut her eyes and smiled just as the globe of white light 
engulfed the AGIST. She was aware that she was about to die, but was not 
afraid or sad.  

&quot;Asuka.&quot; She said, tears dampening her eyes. &quot;At last, I will be able to 
see you again.&quot;

**********

&quot;Oh crap!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom watched as the massive globe of energy started to suck 
away all the buildings and shops behind them. The girl still had 
Silhouette in her grip, and smiled with glee when she saw the hole that 
Garuda had originally created, the one leading back down to Hidden 
Vault. Though her voice was drowned out by the wailing sound of 
destruction that was thundering around her, Tokyo B looked back at the 
armoured girl in her grip and said, &#39;We&#39;re home free, Kagome&#39;.

Tokyo B and Silhouette flew down into that large indent in the Shinjuku 
landscape, and kept diving inside till they reached the innards of 
Hidden Vault. The two landed on the ground with a crash (due to the 
extreme speed that Tokyo Blossom had been going at) but other than that 
they were okay. But even though they were at least forty metres below 
the surface of the city, they could feel the tremors being caused by the 
explosion above ground. Light shone down through the hole leading 
upwards, and the rocks at the ceiling began breaking off and falling 
against the ground that was cracking already. 

Silhouette couldn&#39;t hide the fear she was feeling, but she felt safer as 
Tokyo Blossom wrapped her up in a protective embraced. Tokyo Blossom 
pulled Silhouette down with her, and shielded the younger girl from the 
smashing rocks above. 

But, in minutes, the blast was over. The tremors ended and the light 
died down. The explosion ended. Tokyo Blossom waited a few moments 
before pulling herself off of Silhouette, and then stood up. 

&quot;I think it&#39;s over, Kagome.&quot; She extended a hand to the younger girl, 
and helped up. 

Silhouette looked around this room of Hidden Vault. It was wrecked 
itself, and it was way below the surface of Shinjuku. &quot;W-What kind of 
lunatic unleashes that kind of power on a thriving city?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom growled. &quot;Oh, Minakami will get his, don&#39;t you worry. Now 
let&#39;s get outta here, Kagome. For all we know this place to cave in at 
any moment.&quot;

Silhouette nodded, and followed Tokyo Blossom as she rose up to the hole 
leading back up to the surface of Shinjuku. They came up slowly, 
watching for any stray rocks or debris that would fall from above. None 
did, but they finally saw why as they reached the surface. As they 
landed, both Tokyo B and Silhouette gasped in utter shock from the 
sight. What had formally been the mighty Shinjuku, centre of the Tokyo 
nightlife and business capitol of Japan, was now a smoking pile of 
ashes. 

To the north was the blast crater. It was a bit of a distance away, but 
Tokyo Blossom&#39;s sensors made some frightening discoveries. The crater 
was at least 2.7 miles wide, and almost 4 miles deep. The NOA3 cannon 
had obliterated anything and everything in its path. Silhouette, fell to 
her knees and began weeping, realizing how many people must have been 
killed in that blast. No matter how many people they tried to evacuate, 
there still would have been hundreds of people left inside the 
boundaries of the Shinjuku district. If Hidden Vault had been built any 
closer to the AGIST, then they might not have survived it either. 

It was quiet now, the only sound being Silhouette&#39;s crying. &quot;How? How 
could someone do this? How could someone with any human decency do that 
to so many innocent people?&quot;

&quot;Minakami.&quot; Tokyo Blossom said through gritted teeth. &quot;I&#39;ll make sure 
you suffer for this.&quot;

&quot;GGRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!&quot;

Both Silhouette and Tokyo Blossom froze, as they heard a very familiar 
scream. Tokyo Blossom&#39;s body shook and she swore she was hearing things. 
It couldn&#39;t be. 
 
She was dumbstruck. &quot;There&#39;s... no way... it could have...&quot;

But both Silhouette and Tokyo Blossom looked to the front. A large, 
bounding figure was slowly walking towards them, its four feet moving 
slowly, its pace slow and focused. Silhouette stood on her feet and 
Tokyo B backed up a bit, moving closer to Silhouette protectively. 
Though it had been blasted by the second most powerful beam cannon 
orbiting in the world, the Garuda was still alive and kicking, its feet 
stamping against the flakes of ash that littered the hot ground like 
snow. 

&quot;It&#39;s impossible!&quot; Tokyo Blossom yelled. &quot;How the hell did it survive 
that?&quot;

Silhouette focused a little more on it. &quot;No, look. I think it&#39;s really 
wounded.&quot;

The Garuda slowly trotted on. Though this appeared to be because it was 
pacing itself, it was because the force of the blast weakened Garuda. 
You could plainly see that the Garuda had not come out of explosion 
without harm. The legs, arms and chest had been burned down, the 
polished sheen was gone, and all the silver shining Japanese armour had 
been charred. They fell down bit by bit, crashing with the piles of dust 
and ash around the wasted landscape.  

&quot;Wounded, huh?&quot; Tokyo B. &quot;You&#39;re right, Kagome. Let&#39;s take this thing 
out now, okay?&quot;

Silhouette nodded. &quot;Yeah. Lets do it, Akari.&quot;

The two armoured girls got ready and ran for the ailing Garuda. 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

When I look out into the sky,  
What do I see?
Clouds, storms, what does it all mean to me? 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


&quot;GAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHGGG!!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom and Silhouette jumped up off the dusty ground, toward the 
screaming Garuda. Though it had been beaten senseless by the utter 
relentlessness of NOA3&#39;s World Slayer beam cannon, it had lost none of 
it ferocity. The orbs at Tokyo Blossom&#39;s hands began glowing with power, 
their brightness increasing each second. Silhouette followed the same 
path, gathering power into the orbs at her palms. The two launched a 
synchronized assault at the Garuda, as they spread out both of their 
palms and fired at the creature&#39;s head, its only vulnerable point. 
Garuda kicked and thrashed as chains of crimson red and cobalt blue 
energy blasts were fired at its skull. 


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

When I look into myself,
What do I see?
Heartbreak and agony, jealousy and monotony, 
What does it all mean to me?

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


Garuda stepped back as the combined blast fire from the White Orchid and 
Silhouette Mobile Shells hammered into his already battered head. It 
tried to nod and buck its head away, but it could no longer move as well 
as it previously could. It only got away from this chipping attack, is 
when Tokyo Blossom relinquished this attack, Silhouette following that 
motion. Both girls descended down to the ash covered ground, and 
crouched downwards, reaching for their weapons. Tokyo Blossom withdrew 
her sword from the sheath on her back, while Silhouette pulled forth the 
two daggers from the joints at the back of her waist. Both of the girls 
gathered energy into their weapons, Tokyo Blossom&#39;s sword glowing gold, 
Silhouette&#39;s twin daggers shimmering with sapphire blue light. When they 
were ready, they both charged at the legs of the Garuda, who was still 
trying to shake off the effects of the palm blasters. The Mobile Shell 
girls both yelled as they ran past either side of Garuda&#39;s legs and 
slashed, slicing the weakened Kowa-steel with energy-charged metal of 
their own. 


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


How real could it be?
It&#39;s a steel heart and an iron soul, 
It&#39;s just a thing that I&#39;ve been told.


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


&quot;GGRARAAAAAAHHHHHH!&quot;
   
Garuda&#39;s cry was as fierce as ever, but its cries became far less 
intimidating as it fell towards the ash ground that had been created by 
the blast of the NOA3. It collapsed with a loud thump, a wave of dust 
circulating around that area. Garuda continued to thrash and writhe in 
the gatherings of ashes and cinders, but Tokyo Blossom and Silhouette 
took no notice of its frustrations. In fact, after all the destruction 
that the Garuda had brought down, they relished them. Both girls 
sheathed their blades, slowly, keeping their eyes on the downed Garuda. 
They looked at each other and nodded, both of them knowing what the 
other intended to do. Tokyo Blossom and Silhouette flew up into the 
musky, smoky air, flying back from the Garuda to make room for what was 
to come. The girls calmed themselves and concentrated on their task, 
gathering energy into their core, the large stone at their chest that 
conducted power the likes of which ordinary people had yet to see. Both 
breastplates of both Mobile Shells broke apart in tiny shards, showing 
the twin orbs of strength that were being charged respectively. A few 
seconds later, they fired. 


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


I can think and I can see, 
As long as I stay true to my sense of reality. 
I have the power to laugh and cry, 
There&#39;s a flame in my heart that will never die. 


*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*


Tokyo Blossom and Silhouette both focused and controlled themselves as 
they both fired their respective Hyper Blasts. Garuda had never been 
completely tolerant of them and this was even more so when it felt the 
full force of both consuming energy bursts at once. The Garuda Mobile 
Shell was swallowed up in a maelstrom to tearing, rending white-hot 
energy, burning and corroding the armoured hide that had so greatly 
deflected attacks before. Soon the Garuda&#39;s cries became dying ones, as 
the armour of the beast began to fade away into nothing, along with the 
pilot inside. Tetsuko awoke from her sleep all too late, as her 
premature flesh and bone was burned away along with the metallic carcass 
of the Garuda. Tokyo Blossom and Silhouette looked away as a mighty 
explosion followed, surrounding the nearby area with sparkling golden 
light. Soon this faded, and the two women lowered themselves to the 
ash-soiled ground, and watched as the remaining sparkles of the Garuda 
and Neganas passed on to the next world. And so they stood, the young 
heroes.  Although leagues of devastation and chaos surrounded the two 
women, it still felt like they were the victors in all this. 

Tokyo Blossom stared at her companion, and smiled from behind the slight 
cracked visor of hers. &quot;You know, Shigure was right. Having something to 
protect does give you strength.&quot;
 
**********

&quot;Our headline today. President (Prime Minister) Kazuma Minakami has 
expressed his heartfelt sorrow and anguish for the lives lost in the 
inexplicably destructive attack on Tokyo&#39;s Shinjuku district four days 
ago. After delivering a rousing speech to the supporters of his second 
run as leader, he has sworn to bring to justice all those who brought 
the attack down. The mortality count for that day is now at an estimated 
3800 along with another estimated 9500 injured. The suspects behind this 
atrocity are believed to be the same White Blade Korean terrorists that 
attacked other cities of Japan, although strangely no solid evidence has 
been found to confirm just what caused the blast that obliterated 98% of 
Shinjuku and the surrounding districts.&quot;

Akari switched off the TV in irritation. Minakami was as slippery as a 
snake, and twice as oily. She sat at the edge of Ryoko&#39;s bed, pretty 
springy, while Ryoko was sitting at the other side of the bed, also 
watching (or at least she had been) the news report. Kagome was at the 
window of the room, looking outside. Ryoko&#39;s apartment wasn&#39;t high up, 
but you could still see the Shinjuku crater quite easily from there.   

&quot;That Minakami.&quot; Akari seethed. &quot;I can&#39;t believe he managed to fool the 
press into believing that it was the White Blade who blew up Shinjuku.&quot;

Ryoko nodded. &quot;Uh huh. But we have other things to worry about right 
now.&quot;

&quot;Like what? The whiplash I got from flying around so much?&quot; Akari asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Ryoko began. &quot;In case you have forgotten, we&#39;re out of jobs. 
Unemployed. We can&#39;t take on Minakami with some money coming in, after 
all.&quot;

Akari eyed Ryoko up and down. &quot;Is that why you&#39;re all dressed up? Job 
hunting?&quot;

&quot;Yep. I&#39;m heading down to Ginza for the 411 of job chances for people 
who worked in Shinjuku. It&#39;s a bit of a stretch, but I&#39;m up for it, I 
guess. Would you two like to come?&quot;

Akari looked over at Kagome, standing silently by the window. &quot;Nah, I 
think me and Kagome will just hang here for a while. Thanks though, 
Ryoko. I owe you one for letting us stay here.&quot;
           
&quot;Not at all. I&#39;ll catch you guys later.&quot; 
  
Ryoko said that, then got up, grabbed her coat, and then left through 
the door. Akari looked over at Kagome. She had been a bit shaken up from 
the events of the past two weeks in ways no one could imagine. Finding 
and losing her mother in an instant was probably the biggest agenda on 
Kagome&#39;s mind. Akari knew what that was like. She lost her mom young 
too, but it was probably harder for Kagome since she had never really 
gotten the chance to know Sagi. Akari stood up from the bed, and then 
walked behind the shorter girl, wrapping her lithe arms around her. 
 
&quot;You&#39;re thinking about Sagi, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She asked out of the blue. 

Kagome nodded. &quot;Yeah. I could have been nicer to her. Now she&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s at peace now, Kagome.&quot; Akari said. &quot;That&#39;s probably what she 
wanted more than anything else. All you have to worry about is how to 
live your life in the way you want. Just like I do.&quot;

Kagome then smiled tenderly, savouring Akari&#39;s embrace of her. &quot;I think 
I have just what I need right now. She&#39;s standing right behind me.&quot;

The younger woman rotated herself in such a way that she faced Akari and 
kept the older girl&#39;s arm around her. Reaching up on dainty tiptoes, she 
pressed her lips against Akari&#39;s soft set. Kagome sighed as Akari 
tightened that hold she had of her, and let herself enjoy this for what 
it was. Though her mother, Sagi failed to make things work with Akari&#39;s 
mother, Asuka, there was no chance of her falling into that same trap. 
She was going to make this work. Akari gave a content sigh herself as 
she returned Kagome&#39;s kiss. The battling and fighting she had been doing 
for the past three years seemed like a distant memory. Now she had 
Kagome, nothing else really mattered. As long as she had her love at her 
side, everything else was just a consequence of life.

&#39;I love you, Kagome.&#39;

**********

Deep in the heart of a large mansion building off on the edge of Kyoto, 
was the author of Shinjuku&#39;s destruction, Kazuma Minakami. Dressed in a 
bathrobe, with a bottle/glass of wine perched on the table before the 
couch he was leisurely resting on, Minakami smiled with glee at the 
victory of his plans. Taking Tokyo apart bit by bit was also part of his 
agenda. He was going to correct the mistakes created by the Meiji 
Restoration centuries ago, and was going to make his own &#39;restoration&#39; 
returning Tokyo to the might it had previously as Edo. But this time, in 
this day and age, it would not simply be called Edo; it would be &#39;New 
Edo&#39;. 

A figure appeared at Minakami&#39;s right, walking through one of the many 
doors to his Kyoto mansion&#39;s main room. &quot;Furuta. What news do you 
bring?&quot;

Minakami&#39;s lackey bowed for respect. &quot;The mass production of CFL 
microprocessors, Garuda Mobile Shells and Neganas pilots has been fully 
planned and is ready for your say so. You need only choose which 
locations to begin at and the project will proceed.&quot;

&quot;Start production in Kumamoto, Osaka, Tokushima, Hachinohe, Sapporo and 
here in Kyoto, as soon as you possibly can. With Sagi and the Asuka 
Group out of my way, nothing will stand against my dream of returning 
Japan to the great warrior nation it had previous been. The true 
restoration begins now. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!&quot;  

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

The sword is stained with the blood of life
Bastard on the razor&#39;s edge
I sought to end all strife
That was my heart felt pledge
 
I&#39;m just a ghost, a ghost
A ghost floating on a mountaintop
Too afraid to leave this post
When will the madness stop?

Sadness is my broken heart
Fighting for a new start
In the end the fragile hearts have fled
All the parting words now said

I&#39;m just a ghost, a ghost
A ghost floating on a mountaintop
Too afraid to leave this post
When will the madness stop?

It&#39;s too late for me, my spirit wanders alone
It&#39;s too late to see, my spirit can&#39;t atone
It&#39;s too late to plea, my spirit has always known
It&#39;s too late to flee, my spirit is made of stone

But there&#39;s a hope hidden in the wind
You can forgive those who have sinned
There&#39;s a love that I can now understand
Just search deeper beneath the sand
And when you find the love that you seek
You&#39;ll find the future isn&#39;t that bleak

I&#39;m just a ghost, a ghost
A ghost floating on a mountaintop
Too afraid to leave this post
When will the madness stop?
