<h1>All Girls School (part 63 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch62.html">Back to Part 62</a><pre>&quot;Evening Eternal&quot;

Finally! School was out for the semester and the girls had a good solid 
vacation ahead of them. Many Stantonites went abroad, a few stayed home 
with their families, while some, though unfortunately without a real 
home to go to, could still find a place to stay, where they would be 
welcomed and loved. Kathlyn Parkin fit under the third category. Going 
home for her would be out of the question, and there was only one friend 
she could turn to for safety, the very woman she was in love with.

Leena Marjaana Katajisto had given open invitation for her student to 
visit and even stay over as often as she wished, and Kathlyn constantly 
took her up on her offer, sometimes staying over for days and even weeks 
at a time. She was hardly missed at home&#151;her older brothers were usually 
wasted or AWOL, mother was working her two jobs, and her father...oh, 
she didn&#39;t want to think about that! As long as she and her younger 
sibling Matt were safe, then all was well.

So when the last class of the last day of school in 2004 ended, Kathlyn 
waved farewell to her soccer friends (for she had made quite a few since 
first joining the team), and waited patiently for Leena to finish her 
business. The sweet phys ed teacher had let the girls go off easy in PE, 
giving them a free day to either catch up on homework or else just 
socialize, whatever they wanted. Katt knew she&#39;d have lots of time later 
to be with Leena, so she hung around Jocelyn, who apparently needed the 
friend. Rumor had it that the mother-to-be had quit her romance with her 
best friend, and though Katt didn&#39;t know her well, she was still there 
to console her.

Well, all that was finished now. Everyone was gone, save the last two, 
and the school would soon be completely empty, with the Headmistress the 
very last to leave. Kathlyn busied herself with a book she had brought 
for when she finished her midterms, and got to about the first quarter 
when Leena came up, smiling that same cute smile, and told her she was 
ready. They shared the same car as they drove through chilly winds and 
frosty roads on the way to her apartment; Kathlyn, meanwhile, had 
butterflies. It still hadn&#39;t dawned on her that she would be spending 
nearly three consecutive weeks with the woman she was in love with.

They would probably be sharing the same bed every night.

It sounded an awful lot like a marriage. Kathlyn grinned at that 
thought.

&quot;You seem happy,&quot; observed Leena. &quot;You glad to get out of there?&quot;

&quot;Mm, partially. I kinda miss a few people already.&quot;

&quot;Like who?&quot;

&quot;Mostly girls on the team. They&#39;ve been really good to me.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah? Make any friends?&quot;

&quot;A couple. That&#39;s a huge improvement over the beginning of the 
semester.&quot; Leena made a gentle turn.

&quot;I&#39;m glad. It&#39;s important to have binding friendships now&#151;otherwise, 
you&#39;ll regret not meeting more people down the road. I&#39;ve lived a lot of 
my life in isolation, even in Finland, where most of my friends live. It 
gets lonely. But at least I have you.&quot; Kathlyn grinned shyly, and 
pressed her face to the cold window as she stared at the world passing 
her by. Leena turned on the radio, opting to go for classical music 
instead of the standard holiday fare.

&quot;In Finland,&quot; she said, &quot;we don&#39;t celebrate Christmas with nearly so 
much oomph. Especially my family. It&#39;s a very quiet, solemn occasion. I 
usually visit them during this time of year, or else spring break.&quot;

&quot;But isn&#39;t Finland freezing during the winter?&quot;

&quot;Of course. But I&#39;ve gotten used to it. And parts of it are like 
Iceland, not as cold as you&#39;d think, especially the coastal lowlands. I 
myself live right around Turku, in a small city.&quot;

&quot;So spring break would be the best time to go.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, usually. My body&#39;s slowly adjusting to American weather!&quot; She had 
a good laugh, which lifted Katt&#39;s mood. She made another turn, then 
stopped at a light. The radio switched to a choral song, which was 
conveniently sung in Finnish. Leena smiled brightly, and translated for 
Kathlyn: it was &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, though the tune was so different that 
only a Finnish-speaking person would know it. Kathlyn sighed happily.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Ethereal.&quot; She nodded. Leena turned around and lightly touched 
Kathlyn&#39;s short, dark hair. &quot;I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re going to be spending 
the holiday with me, Katt. I really am.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Am I that good company?&quot;

&quot;More than that. I like you. Actually, and I&#39;m going to be forward with 
you on this, so I don&#39;t want to scare you off...&quot; Kathlyn nodded, 
indicating the older woman could proceed. &quot;...Actually, to be honest, 
I&#39;m really...in love with you.&quot; And to prove it, while the light was 
still red, Leena cupped Kathlyn&#39;s chin and kissed her firmly. It wasn&#39;t 
as if they had never kissed before&#151;Kathlyn remembered touching Leena&#39;s 
gentle lips many times while they were falling asleep&#151;but this seemed 
more real, more personal, probably because it was so public, and...

Had Leena told Katt that she loved her?

A car horn blared behind them, forcing Leena to release the younger 
woman. The light had turned green while they were...occupied. She 
quickly composed herself and drove onward, straight for about two miles. 
Kathlyn, meanwhile, was both breathless and speechless. Leena was in 
love with her? HER? The frail little girl who couldn&#39;t even run a lap 
without stopping to gasp for air? The pathetic little runaway who always 
clung so tightly to her? The silly little urchin who was eleven years 
younger, not to mention a student? The one who had nothing special about 
her&#151;Leena loved her?!

Unbelievable.

&quot;You...love me?&quot; she whispered. Though driving, Leena still paid her 
some focus.

&quot;Yes, I do. I hope that doesn&#39;t make you uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;...No!&quot; she exclaimed quietly. &quot;I actually like it. But why me?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re what I&#39;ve been looking for in a woman,&quot; she answered 
frankly. Kathlyn blinked.

&quot;Me?&quot;

&quot;Of course. You&#39;re a fun girl, but you&#39;re not wild or unusually crazy; 
you&#39;re the clean kind of fun. You care deeply about your brother, you&#39;re 
much better at computers than I am, you make me laugh, and I know you&#39;ve 
got a creative streak. Plus you&#39;re very kind and loving, and frank. 
And...this is silly, but I think you&#39;re really cute, too. That red and 
black hair of yours is really exotic. And...you kind of remind me of 
myself when I was your age.&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot; Kathlyn took a breath. Since when did she have so many good 
traits? &quot;Uh, Leena, you know, I&#39;m also...eleven years younger, and a 
student.&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re eighteen regardless, which, if I still recall, is legal 
adult age.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but I&#39;m still just a kid. Most people say I look fifteen.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re fine just the way you are. And I&#39;m not most people.&quot; Leena gave 
her a smile, and reached out to squeeze Kathlyn&#39;s hand. &quot;Why is it that 
you have such a hard time believing me? Aren&#39;t I free to choose whom I 
fall in love with?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; she said, blushing. &quot;It&#39;s hard to accept 
because...um...this is so silly, but...I&#39;ve kinda had a crush on you 
since the first day of school...and I&#39;ve fallen in love with you since.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, that does explain a few things. So what is it you see in me, 
anyway?&quot; Kathlyn giggled to herself.

&quot;This is so screwball. You&#39;re exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for&#151;not in 
a woman, but in general. Somebody who could...protect me, make me feel 
safe. Somebody...yeah, secretly, a little older than me.&quot;

&quot;Eleven years isn&#39;t a little, Katt.&quot;

&quot;I know. I don&#39;t mind. I think I need it anyway. And you have always 
supported me, especially when I had doubts about myself. And you&#39;ve been 
so good about letting me stay over...&quot;

&quot;Speak of the devil,&quot; said Leena, as she drove into the apartment 
complex she lived in. It took them five quiet minutes to enter into 
Leena&#39;s pad, and ten seconds to adjust to the wave of heat that 
defrosted them from the December air. They took off their shoes and sat 
down. Leena offered to order some take-out, and suggested a nice Thai 
place she liked. Kathlyn was so hungry, she could&#39;ve eaten cardboard.

......

The food was just spicy enough to clear up a congested nose and warm the 
stomach. As they ate, Leena popped in one of the few movies she owned, a 
Fritz Lang production Kathlyn had never heard of. She liked it, though, 
and cuddled next to Leena once they disposed of the food (she had been 
hungry enough for the both of them). Leena found herself enjoying the 
warmth and closeness of Katt&#39;s body, and completely forgot that this 
girl was not only considerably younger than her, but a student as well, 
her student. She was just Kathlyn in that moment, nothing more&#151;but 
Kathlyn to her was quite a lot. She folded her arms around the girl&#39;s 
body and held her close right until the closing credits.

She kissed Kathlyn&#39;s ear and whispered her name. Kathlyn. I love you so 
much.

I love you too, Leena. She smiled.

&quot;Wanna know a secret? This is a secret fantasy of mine, one of four 
fantasies I&#39;ve always had.&quot; Katt looked up, inquisitive.

&quot;Hmm? This is a fantasy?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve always wanted to lie on a couch with a beautiful young 
woman, just holding her, like this. We wouldn&#39;t even have to do 
anything, except maybe listen to some music.&quot;

&quot;Oh. That sounds nice. Any music you like in particular?&quot;

&quot;Uh, Hitomi and I&#151;Miss Madsen, I mean&#151;we share similar interests, but I 
don&#39;t care for Wagner. I&#39;m more of a Tchaikovsky girl, and Rachmaninov. 
You familiar with their works?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...mom used to take me to Tchaikovsky ballets when I was little. I 
didn&#39;t understand them much.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Wow. I really envy you now. I&#39;ve always wanted to go see a 
Tchaikovsky ballet, no matter which one. Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, the 
Nutcracker... Actually, that&#39;s another fantasy, to see one with a nice 
young lady.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Kathlyn smiled, then got an idea. &quot;Hey, uh...Leena? You know, um, 
I could probably ask my mom if she could pull a few strings to get some 
ballet tickets.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, apparently she knows somebody in the business; that&#39;s how she was 
able to take me so often when I was young, or so I&#39;m told.&quot;

&quot;You mean you could do that?!&quot; Leena nearly sat up, spilling Katt in the 
process, she was so startled. Parkin hung on and nodded.

&quot;Well, if I can take her aside. I mean, she&#39;s not gone all the time, and 
it&#39;s not like it would be hard.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow! Katt, would you really do that for me!?&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;I owe you that much at least. I&#39;d be 
happy to&#151;of course, I&#39;d be the one who went with you.&quot; Leena was too 
stricken with joy to answer, so she just smiled, eyes brimming with 
tears, and took Kathlyn in her arms to embrace her and kiss her.

&quot;Oh, Katt! That would be the greatest thing anybody&#39;s ever done for me! 
How could I repay you for that!?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m...fine,&quot; she managed through the myriad of smooches. &quot;R-really. 
Uh...whoa&#151;hehe! Really, I&#39;m okay. This is my means of paying you back.&quot;

&quot;Katt...&quot; Leena wept for joy, and took Parkins&#39; face in her hands; they 
rubbed noses tenderly. Looking into Leena&#39;s dark brown eyes, so full of 
loyalty, honor, hidden emotion, undying strength and love...it was no 
wonder Kathlyn had fallen for her, nor she for Kathlyn. They kissed 
deeply, lovingly, sharing everything they had for each other, primarily 
love. Leena held Kathlyn tight, wanting the two to merge, so intoxicated 
was she with this young, wonderful, dear girl...

Parkin shied away with a big smile when she &quot;accidentally&quot; slipped her 
tongue inside Leena&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Heheh...whoops. Got carried away there for a sec.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so cute!&quot; exclaimed Leena, who of course looked cute herself 
when she smiled. &quot;You know,&quot; she added, &quot;there&#39;s a reason why I love 
ballet so much. I used to be a dancer when I was about your age, and 
younger.&quot;

&quot;You know...that makes sense. You do look more like a ballet dancer than 
a buffed-up gym teacher.&quot; They both chuckled, and kissed&#151;proof that 
their relationship was no doubt solid by then. &quot;So why&#39;d you quit?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I still dance, but it&#39;s not a good way to pay the bills. I use what 
I learned in class a lot. My big dream is to be a ballet instructor, but 
until that comes, I&#39;ll just be teaching you girls how to use your 
bodies.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; sang Kathlyn saucily, conceiving what hidden meaning might&#39;ve been 
in there. Leena grinned and kissed her nose.

&quot;Not like that.&quot;

&quot;Heheh. Okay. So, you&#39;ve told me three of your fantasies&#151;&quot;

&quot;Well, two. Ballet instructor is more like a long-term goal.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So what&#39;re your other two?&quot; Leena shied away, and Katt could 
visibly see her turn hot pink. &quot;Oh, so it&#39;s one of those fantasies.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing dirty. They&#39;re both...erotic, yes, but quite sweet. 
Clean eroticism, you could say&#151;like...a husband telling his wife he 
would like to make love to her in certain places, during certain times 
of the day. Very wholesome.&quot;

&quot;So you think that sort of thing is wholesome?&quot;

&quot;Well, the husband-wife thing, yes. Katt, let&#39;s face it, sex is good.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Chuckle.

&quot;And like all good things, you shouldn&#39;t have too little or too much. 
Keep it in moderation and you&#39;ll see just how beautiful it is. If the 
two partners have that kind of loving bond, they can find purity in 
every sexual act, even if it is a little kinky. But my fantasies are 
completely wholesome.&quot;

&quot;So tell me.&quot; Leena mirrored Parkins&#39; inquisitive smile.

&quot;You know what curiosity did to the cat...Katt?&quot;

&quot;You silly!&quot; She slapped Leena playfully; they kissed and Leena took her 
to her window, one that overlooked a large, wide-open area, 
uninterrupted by city or woods. The moon could be seen at the right 
angle, glowing with a pale light since it was not quite completely dark 
yet. A few bright stars could be seen; Kathlyn could easily identify a 
few since she had paid attention during McGowen&#39;s astronomy sessions.

She felt Leena hold onto her from behind, and touched her teacher&#39;s 
arms. Or was it her girlfriend&#39;s arms? &quot;Leena?&quot; She wanted to know. 
&quot;Before you tell me, uh...could I ask you something? Are we 
like...girlfriends or something?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like us to be.&quot; They smiled.

&quot;I guess we are, then.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. Now you know we can&#39;t exactly prance around the school like this 
once we get back. I&#39;m still your teacher in those walls, and you&#39;re 
still my student. But I&#39;ll always be your friend.&quot;

&quot;So...it&#39;s just for this holiday?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; She had to think about it. &quot;...During school, of course, we 
can&#39;t. But you know...whenever it lets out, we can...assume the 
positions?&quot; Leena winked, Kathlyn grinned. That sounded like a fair 
agreement. They kissed on it, ultimately sealing their relationship. 
Now, there was only one thing left to cover:

&quot;So! About those fantasies!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. Um...&quot; Leena turned bashfully quiet again, rocking Katt back 
and forth slowly in her arms. Parkin loved such attention and would&#39;ve 
probably fallen asleep, forgetting about her question, had Leena not 
stirred her. &quot;It&#39;s kinda weird. One of my biggest fantasies for years 
has been...to dance in the nude together, with the woman I loved, 
underneath the moonlight. Uh...of course, I&#39;ve never really done that, 
not even with the few girlfriends I considered lovers.&quot;

&quot;And how many was that?&quot;

&quot;Just two,&quot; she answered. &quot;My third girlfriend was the first I really 
felt love for. We were both seventeen at the time, taking the same 
ballet class. Gosh, has it been that long?&quot;

&quot;Um, Leena, you&#39;ve got like this really spaced-out look in your eyes. 
Come back to Earth! Leena! Earth to Leena!&quot; Leena chuckled and snapped 
playfully at Katt&#39;s waving hand, then kissed it twice.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so jealous, we broke up before graduation. Or rather, she 
broke up with me.&quot;

&quot;Hmph. She was a fool.&quot;

&quot;Nah, we&#39;ve been best friends all our lives, and we decided to stay that 
way. The other...gosh! Don&#39;t ask me about her!&quot;

&quot;I probably shouldn&#39;t.&quot; Kathlyn smiled gently and kissed Leena, probably 
more to bring her back to the present moment than anything else. She had 
not experienced love the way Leena had; her romances included a few days 
with Ancelin and a failed fling with X Walker that ended with sex 
followed by a break-up. So naturally she was a bit jealous.

&quot;It was a long time ago anyway,&quot; said Leena. &quot;I&#39;m more interested in the 
present moment, and you. I actually like you more than my other two 
lovers. Neither of them were really what I wanted or needed, though one 
came close. But she broke my heart horribly.&quot;

&quot;My god, what did she do?&quot;

&quot;Well, without getting into detail, and it&#39;s a long story, she lied to 
me&#151;a really big lie that dragged on for three years.&quot;

&quot;Oh no...&quot; Kathlyn gasped, feeling the urge to hold Leena, to comfort 
her, to switch roles and protect her. Leena smiled sweetly at such 
kindness and allowed Katt these pleasures&#151;and more.

&quot;You are so sweet,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Everything I wanted...everything I 
needed...my wonderful kitty-Katt.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so is that my pet name?&quot;

&quot;You want it to be?&quot; Kathlyn let out a myaow and pawed Leena gently; she 
was grabbed and embraced, laughing all the while. They ended up staring 
into each other&#39;s eyes at length, then kissing at length. Kathlyn&#39;s 
fingers slowly wove their way around Leena&#39;s shirt, unbuttoning the 
three top buttons with quiet dexterity. Leena noticed and became flush.

&quot;Uh...Katt, what&#39;re you doing?&quot;

&quot;Your fantasy,&quot; she whispered, kissing her cheek. Leena stared.

&quot;Oh. Um...oh!&quot;

&quot;Lift your arms.&quot; Leena wordlessly obeyed. She felt like she was being 
hypnotized. Like she was being woven into some magical trance by this 
wonderful, unpredictable lass, and she was powerless to stop it. As 
Kathlyn lifted Leena&#39;s shirt off her body and took a moment to gaze 
fondly at her sports bra, though, she realized she really didn&#39;t want to 
stop it either.

&quot;Now you do mine,&quot; she instructed, raising her own arms. Leena still 
felt like she was under the spell, so with gentle care, she raised 
Katt&#39;s black long-sleeved shirt. Kathlyn lowered her naked arms when she 
could and let Leena&#39;s eyes linger as she reached for the older woman&#39;s 
sweatpants. Kathlyn had gray jeans; both pairs were off and folded 
lazily on the couch in moments. Parkin smiled shyly as she beheld her 
teacher and new girlfriend in all her beautiful, muscular glory.

She had to admit, Leena made wearing a sports bra and boxers look really 
sexy.

&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Leena in awe as Kathlyn turned around. &quot;Cool tattoo!&quot;

&quot;Oh, you like my Luck Dragon?&quot; She craned her head and encouraged Leena 
to touch it. It was a black-and-gold colored Chinese dragon, its length 
running from the nape of her neck to the small of her back. &quot;I got this 
after losing a bet when I was fifteen. It cost me a fortune and it hurt 
like hell, but...I think it looks cool now.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say!&quot; Leena grinned and kissed the dragon, and then, 
mischievously, her fingers unhooked the clasp on Kathlyn&#39;s white 
brassiere. She slipped it off with her own hands, careful not to grope 
anything unnecessarily. She held Kathlyn by her naked belly and kissed 
the side of her neck.

&quot;Wanna do mine now? Or shall I...?&quot; Her voice trailed as her hands 
trailed (down near her underwear). Kathlyn shivered with anticipation 
and disbelief. Leena was really doing this to her!

&quot;You can...do...&quot; she managed. Leena knelt down, kissed the small of her 
girlfriend&#39;s back, and lowered her underwear carefully (getting a rather 
splendid view of her bare bottom in the process). Kathlyn stepped out of 
the discarded cloth and stood with her back turned, not yet wishing to 
reveal herself. Leena understood and turned around. It was now Katt&#39;s 
turn. Gracefully, she lifted the sports bra off, taking some time to 
kiss the bare flesh she was now exposed to. She called out her 
girlfriend&#39;s name as she gently pulled down the boxers (also getting a 
splendid view), and kissed the area that Leena had kissed not long ago.

&quot;I love you so much,&quot; she sighed as she wrapped her arms around Leena&#39;s 
body. Her beloved teacher arched her head back and sighed with 
pleasure&#151;not erotic, but pleasure from pure love. Finally, they turned 
around, and saw each other for what they really were. There were a few 
surprises.

Then, once their eyes had gotten their fill (for the moment), Kathlyn 
grinned shyly, walked forward, and took Leena&#39;s hands.

&quot;Shall we dance?&quot; Leena nodded awkwardly. She opened her blinds and 
turned off all lights, leaving only the moon to illuminate them. Silence 
was their song; nakedness was their comfort; electricity was their 
pleasure when bare skin touched, whether in feathery brushes or crushing 
grips. Kathlyn inhaled sharply as she felt Leena&#39;s breasts kiss her 
skin...and when her own bosom came in contact with the older woman.

They danced, they held, they kissed slowly, they dropped all 
inhibitions&#151;they embraced, naked and anxious, until they began to 
smolder all around. They had felt this sort of thing before, with 
others, but never...like this. Leena rocked her girlfriend slowly as 
they held each other close in the moonlight. Dancing turned to swaying. 
Swaying turned to gentle rocking. Rocking turned into stillness; Kathlyn 
was suffocating from the offense of feelings and emotions. She would 
need years to process this one single event.

&quot;This was wonderful,&quot; Leena whispered in her ear. Kathlyn looked up at 
her and smiled, and pulled her head close so they could share their 
umpteenth kiss. This time they dared wiggle past boundaries, this time 
they dared see how far the other could be pushed. Kathlyn felt Leena&#39;s 
tongue visit her mouth. Leena moaned as the younger girl squeezed her 
breast.

&quot;You never told me your last fantasy,&quot; whispered Parkin. Leena giggled.

&quot;To walk naked on the beach, hand-in-hand, with my one true love. And 
then make sweet love underneath the stars, by the shore.&quot;

&quot;You sure do love your nudity,&quot; she remarked wryly. Leena grinned and 
admitted to it, but hey, it was a pretty wholesome idea at its core. 
&quot;Well,&quot; whispered Katt seductively, &quot;we&#39;re not at the beach, but 
maybe...this could be the next best thing?&quot;

&quot;...Katt!&quot; Leena gasped and found herself falling onto her bed; she 
accepted Kathlyn completely that evening; what happened between the two 
after that was for their enjoyment and knowledge only. But suffice to 
say, there were still plenty of surprises yet to be found.

That one night, their first as lovers, seemed to go on and on, an 
eternal evening...
