<h1>Bloody Guardian (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/bloodguard-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Gods, but she was tired of Christmas!

Heather McKennit tried not to think uncharitable
thoughts as she walked by yet another window,
decorated with the usual sparkling lights and tree,
presents scattered around the gaudy display. For the
tenth time that day a droning Christmas carol played
in the background, setting her teeth on edge.

&#39;Bloody fools,&#39; Heather thought, the tall black haired
woman moving through the crowded street with ease. The
mob may have been fools, but they were at least
subconsciously aware of the predator in their midst,
giving her plenty of space.

A newspaper whipped by and Heather picked it up,
casually scanning the front page. December 24th,
1979... there was a cease fire in Rhodesia, the
Soviets had invaded Afghanistan and the Europeans had
launched a rocket called the Ariane. With a scowl she
dropped the paper and continued on, knowing she had
things to do.

The air might have been icy cold, but Heather didn&#39;t
feel it as she strode through the snow, her boots
making soft crunching sounds as she walked away from
busy businesses and up a side alley. Her few breaths
barely showed in the air, the vampire only breathing
out of habit rather than any need.

knock knock

&quot;Yeah?&quot; a harsh voice asked.

&quot;It&#39;s Heather,&quot; she answered calmly.

There was a rattle of chain and a bolt being thrown,
then with a groan of rusty hinges the door swung
inward. The old man looked up at her with suspicious
eyes as he asked her, &quot;So you&#39;re the one, eh?&quot;

Heather gave him a cold glance, one almost as chilled
as the winter air. &quot;Move, now,&quot; she ordered flatly,
menace radiating from her very pores.

He paled visibly, moving aside so that she could
enter. Inside was a carefully maintained front room,
the fire burning merrily to try to warm it up. The
windows were covered by heavy curtains, the furniture
scattered around evoking images of a long ago age.

&quot;How is the old woman?&quot; Heather asked, gentling her
tone just a bit.

&quot;She&#39;s dying,&quot; he shrugged, &quot;just as she was when you
first came here.&quot; He gave Heather a measuring glance,
&quot;Have you decided?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Come on, then,&quot; he turned around to lead her to the
rear door of the suite, opening it up almost silently.

Within was a warmer room, the walls lined with
blankets to hold in the warmth. A large bed crouched
in the middle, lit by lamps on each side, and a old
lady lay wrapped in blankets in the center reading
from a old book.

&quot;I was a child and she was a child,

In this kingdom by the sea;

But we loved with a love that was more than love-

I and my Annabel Lee&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Poe,&quot; Heather noted quietly as she entered.

&quot;Edgar Allan, yes,&quot; the lady&#39;s hands were wrinkled,
gnarled with age yet moved with surprising delicacy as
she put a cloth book mark in place, closing the
leather bound book with obvious respect. Looking up at
Heather with blind blue eyes she said, &quot;I find he
comforts me, in my final days.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I couldn&#39;t find you sooner, Virginia,&quot;
Heather said as she took a seat beside her in a
battered wooden chair.

&quot;You know,&quot; Virginia said conversationally, &quot;I still
don&#39;t believe you are the woman who wooed me back in
1913...&quot;

Heather chuckled softly. &quot;I wish to hell we never made
that trip to Europe,&quot; Heather said, reaching out to
take that warm hand in hers, &quot;your family would never
have called you home and I&#39;d not have spent the next
four years killing Krauts.&quot;

&quot;Your old fashioned ways are showing again,&quot; Virginia
managed a smile, &quot;no one says Kraut any more.&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Heather made a soft sound of regret.
Clasping Virginia&#39;s hand in both of her&#39;s she said,
&quot;It doesn&#39;t have to end this way.&quot;

&quot;Always my shining knight,&quot; Virginia smiled sadly.
&quot;Even you can&#39;t restore me, Heather... and I don&#39;t
care to imagine living on like this.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Heather sighed.

&quot;Best to end it now,&quot; Virginia sighed. A faint smile,
&quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sure?&quot; Heather asked, pain and regret lacing
her voice.

&quot;I&#39;ve never been more sure of anything,&quot; Virginia
sighed, closing her eyes.

Heather leaned forward, her lips drawing back as her
fangs unsheathed... then with a starling suddenness
she struck!

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;You seem lost in thought,&quot; the quiet voice pulled
Heather away from a unpleasant Christmas memory.

Heather turned in her seat at the bar, eyebrows raised
slightly as she recognized the other woman. A few
months ago she had helped Alice, and in a second
encounter took enough of her sweet blood to make her
forget Heather. The redhead was smaller than her,
though that was true of most women, and her green eyes
were soft and gentle.

&quot;I guess so,&quot; Heather nodded, &quot;I was just thinking
of... wasted opportunities.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that,&quot; Alice smiled. She frowned,
looking at Heather, &quot;I have the oddest sense of
deja-vu... have we met before?&quot;

&quot;I just have that kind of face,&quot; Heather smiled.

&quot;I doubt that,&quot; Alice waved uselessly towards the busy
bartender to ask for a drink,&quot; you&#39;re very striking.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s pretty busy,&quot; Heather moved gracefully off her
stool, &quot;what would you like? I can get it for you.&quot;

&quot;Gin and tonic, thanks,&quot; Alice smiled warmly.

Moving up the bar Heather skewered several customers
with a disdainful gaze, &quot;Move, now.&quot; Turning to Carter
she said, &quot;Beer and a gin and tonic.&quot;

&quot;I see you met your friend,&quot; Carter smiled. The brown
and gray haired man dropped his voice, &quot;She came back
a few weeks ago... oddly she&#39;s only been with the
ladies since then.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Heather took the drinks and walked back up
the bar to where Alice waited. The girl had changed
since they last met... a bit of her innocence seemed
to have worn away, replaced by a new confidence.
Instead of plain clothes she wore a tight little
dress, understated jewels and makeup making her even
more stunning.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alice smiled charmingly as she took her
glass, &quot;I love it when a woman is also a gentleman.&quot;

&quot;I try,&quot; Heather agreed as she sat. &#39;Did my attempt to
erase her memory fail?&#39; Heather wondered, &#39;Or did our
encounter merely awaken something within her?&#39;

Christmas music began, a more upbeat tune than
earlier. &quot;I suppose you don&#39;t care to dance?&quot; Alice
asked musingly.

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Heather asked as she drank
her beer.

&quot;Because to be honest,&quot; Alice smiled wryly as she
looked Heather over, taking in the mixed cues of
leather jacket and body hugging skirt, &quot;I&#39;m not sure
who&#39;d lead.&quot;

Heather felt her voice drop to a purr, &quot;I lead,
usually.&quot;

&quot;But do you want to dance?&quot; Alice winked.

Heather felt herself smile at the girl&#39;s flirtations.
&#39;This may not be a good idea,&#39; she finished her beer,
&#39;but maybe I deserve a Christmas gift this year.&#39;
Rising she offered her a hand, &quot;Then let&#39;s dance.&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; Alice purred as they
walked out to the dance floor then cuddled close.</pre>
