~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuya&#39;s Room, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

The day of the Semi Finals had gone by smoothly enough. The results were 
known to all who had come to the island; regardless of where they got to 
during the matches of Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou. Aarin had defeated 
Ingrid (much to Setsuya&#39;s pleasure) and Ra El Khahid was beaten by 
Setsuya. This pitted Aarin and Setsuya against each other directly in 
the finals of the tournament. The whole tournament was coming down to 
this match. But both Setsuya and Aarin had agreed that there were more 
important things going on for them to worry about. The Shougatsu 
Financial Group&#39;s true aims were one of them. The other being the safety 
of Lin-Lin. Setsuya was sure that she was here; but he had no idea about 
how these guys might be treating her. Such thoughts made his blood boil. 
But for now he had to keep those urges bottled up. Until he rescued 
Lin-Lin, he had to play it carefully. After all, there was still no 
complete guarantee that she was here. 

Setsuya took a deep breath and flopped onto the bed of his room. He had 
taken off his clothes (leaving behind only the boxers he was wearing) 
and had given his gear to one of the maids at hand nearby. They did 
their jobs well and told Setsuya that his clothes would be washed and 
dried; ready for tomorrow&#39;s match. People that worked for the Shougatsu 
outside of their dirty dealings tended to be normal folk. Setsuya was 
happy that not all of the corporation were devious. At the moment he 
thought of this; Setsuya clutched his face. A stinging pain throbbed at 
his cheek. All thanks to that bloody Hundred Staff move of Ra El 
Khahid&#39;s. The Japanese boy had applied some disinfectant and cleaned up 
his cuts. Most of them. He had put three plasters over his face too. One 
on his right cheek, one over the bridge of his nose, and the other 
patching up the gash on his forehead. The rest of his body was a bit 
bruised but nothing serious. Thankfully. That didn&#39;t mean that his 
current gashes didn&#39;t sting from the liquid disinfectant. Who would have 
thought that fighting some guy with a staff would have been so much 
trouble? That was over now though. Time to look ahead of him and think 
of the future. 

The future was... Aarin. 

Setsuya took his hand off his face and thought of it. The Finals of the 
tournament would be taking place tomorrow morning. Him versus Aarin. 
Normally there would have been far more anticipation on Setsuya&#39;s part 
in all this. But this really wasn&#39;t the time for a battle between the 
two of them. Not only was Setsuya a bit bruised up, he wasn&#39;t focused on 
the match. All he could really think of was Lin-Lin and how she was 
doing. Was she safe? Was she being battered around? Was she even on the 
Island of Creation? With such thoughts spinning a mile a minute in the 
brain of the Seisuji-lad, what hope would he have of being able to focus 
on the match between himself and Aarin?

&quot;If only this fight were under different circumstances,&quot; Setsuya 
offered, &quot;Then nothing could stop me from concentrating on it. And 
Aarin... I wonder what he thinks about all this...&quot;

The two of them had a rivalry within a friendship. They were good 
friends but deep down had this urge to outdo the other when it came to 
swordsmanship. These feelings were at their peak during the Yuuga School 
days. Now it was more along the lines of &#39;living up to&#39; their past 
rivalries and disputes. Maybe a fresh new match might finally prove 
which of them was the better fighter. Their skills were so equal that it 
was hard to tell a difference between them. While thinking of this, 
Setsuya cast a glimpse over at the other side of his bed. On it was the 
Fire Cutter, wrapped in the confinement of its scabbard. That sword of 
his would be going head to head with Aarin&#39;s Wind Soul in the morning. 

Then a knock came at the door. Followed by a voice. 

&quot;Can I come in?&quot; It called. 

&quot;...Sure,&quot; Setsuya nodded, looking upwards, &quot;It&#39;s open.&quot;

The thick wooden door, framed with iron, parted with a creak. A woman 
stepped through the door to the inside of Setsuya&#39;s room. The Japanese 
boy looked upwards to see who it was. And he knew her. It was Chizuru 
Hukuta of the Water Magic Style. Obviously she had rested up well after 
her defeat because she looked great again. Setsuya smiled and rested his 
hands over his bare knees lazily.

&quot;Hey, Chizuru,&quot; He offered, &quot;What can I do for you?&quot;

The older Japanese woman ran a hand through her hair. &quot;It&#39;s more along 
the lines of what I can do to help you. I don&#39;t need the ship to get 
back to the mainland. My Water Magics can take me wherever I wish to go. 
So I plan on leaving as soon as the tournament is over.&quot;

&quot;So, did you come to say goodbye or something?&quot; Setsuya knew he was 
spoken for but he couldn&#39;t help but flirt a little.

Chizuru smiled at him. &quot;Not really. The reason I came is because I trust 
you to bring these people down. Just as you promised. And to help you 
resolve your own issues, I want to give you this.&quot;

The older woman placed her arm behind her back and withdrew something 
from the sash of her kimono. It was a roll of paper. She walked up to 
Setsuya and placed the roll of paper into the youth&#39;s hand. He looked up 
at her with a confused glare. &quot;What the heck is this?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a kind of map to the layout of Neuschwanstein Castle and the 
Complex,&quot; Chizuru ran one of her sleek hand through her ebony black 
hair, &quot;You told me that you came here to rescue a girl that had been 
taken by the Shougatsu Financial Group. Well you can use that to track 
her down. She is likely to be held in the cells in the Castle but you 
should know that there are no guarantees. This is all I can do for you 
now, Setsuya.&quot;

It was much more than what he would have expected from Chizuru. 
Especially after winning against her in the opening rounds of the 
tournament. Setsuya smiled at the older woman and clutched the map 
tightly. &quot;Thanks, Chizuru. I won&#39;t forget this.&quot;

Chizuru shook her head. &quot;No need to thank me. Just make sure these 
Shougatsu dogs don&#39;t get to go ahead with their plans. The Neo-Japanese 
Government can&#39;t make a move against them without definite evidence. But 
I know that they have something dark planned. I&#39;m counting on you to 
stop them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, Chizuru,&quot; He replied, &quot;It&#39;s in my hands now.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Holy Basilica of the Fallen Ones, Island of Creation  

The Finals had arrived.

Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou was about to conclude. The final match was to 
be staged in a church that had been built at the same time as 
Neuschwanstein Castle had been. This place just happened to be called 
The Holy Basilica of the Fallen Ones. Like most places on the Island of 
Creation, it took its name for a reason. When wars or conflicts took 
place in the past, people would come here to worship and prey for those 
who had died. It had been built specifically for that reason and that 
reason alone. Until now, of course. Christianity was a dying religion 
since the landing of the Genesis Comet. Just like it was for Judaism, 
Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Shintoism, etc. Religion itself had been 
thrown into weakness. For reasons not so unfair. The tragedy that befell 
the world was beyond belief. To call that chastisement for the sins of 
mankind sounded so heavy-handed in idea. So naturally those who took 
this as a theory were likely to put others off from religion. There was 
also the idea that people&#39;s lives were short these days. Nobody wanted 
to waste it by wallowing on their knees to gods that had &#39;attempted&#39; to 
kill them. And because of this; the churches, temples and religious 
shrines like the Holy Basilica of the Fallen Ones had been taken up for 
different uses. Homes, storehouses, shops. They all had different uses. 
This one was being used for the final fight of the tournament.

Between Setsuya and Aarin.

The two fighters, both trained at the Yuuga School of Neo-Japan, stood 
apart from each other across the cleared pinewood floor of the Holy 
Basilica. The rows of seats, the altars, the decorated rugs and bible 
books had all been cleared out of the way for the fight. The only thing 
left about that church that made it maintain that aura of spirituality 
were the stained glass windows to the sides of the walls. They depicted 
images of great pioneers and prophets, knights and wise men. It made the 
location more haunting than it truly was. 

Setsuya and Aarin watched each other without saying a word. Setsuya had 
patched himself up well yesterday and Chizuru had been kind enough to 
heal his injuries with her magical powers. All that was left on Setsuya 
now was a bandage over the bridge of his nose. Now he was ready for 
this. Well, as much as he would ever be. Aarin ran a hand through his 
long blonde bangs and smiled as best as he could. A smile had never come 
naturally to him. 

&quot;So here we are,&quot; Aarin said, slowly, &quot;I could have guessed that we 
would have been the ones to face each other in the finals of the 
tournament. All great rivalries come full circle, do they not...?&quot;

&quot;Maybe they do,&quot; Setsuya replied, &quot;But we aren&#39;t kids anymore, man. 
Things have changed. The Master&#39;s gone, the Shougatsu are at large and 
these swords of ours seem to be taking a spotlight for their plans. It&#39;s 
time to see once and for all which of us it the better swordfighter. Me 
or You.&quot;

Aarin bent at the knees, his hand hovering over the Wind Soul&#39;s hilt. 
&quot;Agreed. We have to stop the Shougatsu. But since we are here in these 
circumstances, we might as well use them to settle our own issues. I 
want you to show me no quarter, Setsuya. Lets see just how much you 
learned in the past two years.&quot;

Setsuya smiled confidently at his rival and bent at the knees, ready to 
draw Fire Cutter. A typical opening stance of the Japanese Yuuga style. 
The two fighter locked eyes once more and waited for the other to 
attack. Because of this they remained in their positions for over three 
minutes. There wasn&#39;t the tiniest flaw in the defence of either fighter. 
So it had to start off with a charge. The flash of alertness and 
intuition ran wild through both Setsuya and Aarin. Their boots began 
running forwards in parallel speeds. The two Yuuga Fighters began their 
charge, gripping the handles of their swords while sheathed. Not a 
condition that would remain for very long. Setsuya and Aarin reached 
striking distance of each other and drew their swords at lightning 
speeds. The sound of Fire Cutter&#39;s blade clashing with that of the Wind 
Soul echoed throughout the Holy Basilica. They ran past each other, 
exchanging their positions. They both skidded to a stop and then turned 
around to look at the other. The fabric of Aarin&#39;s black leather jacket 
parted at the left shoulder. And the fabric of Setsuya&#39;s brown Bomber 
jacket parted over the right shoulder. It was a tie. 

Setsuya grinned. &quot;You&#39;re faster than you were before...&quot;

&quot;...And you parry better than you once did,&quot; Aarin replied, &quot;But I 
haven&#39;t even begun to fight. So get ready, Setsuya.&quot;

It was time to fight with more than just brawn and weaponry. Time to 
fight with the mind. Aarin re-drew the Wind Soul from its temporary 
sleep and then cast his sky sapphire eyes upwards. To the rafters of the 
Holy Basilica. Aarin slashed through the air violently and that slash 
was aimed at the roof. Setsuya knew what that was. It was  an Air Wave 
Stroke. The special technique that Aarin had designed for himself. Back 
in the Yuuga School days, one of the graduation tests were to invent 
your own sword skill. That had been Aarin&#39;s skill. To slash so hard and 
so swiftly that the wind resistance did the damage. Not the slash 
itself. So Setsuya followed the line of sight straight up to Aarin&#39;s 
supposed target. One of the beams up above that supported the roof of 
the Holy Basilica. The Air Wave Stroke cut through the wooden beam like 
it was nothing at all. The beam soon dislodged from its position up 
above and began plummeting towards the wooden floorboards beneath. It 
was falling in Setsuya&#39;s direction. The Japanese man blinked. Attacking 
with a piece of wood? Surely Aarin knew that wouldn&#39;t work on him? 
Setsuya left his hand poised on Fire Cutter until the sliced wooden beam 
came within reach of him. He soon withdrew the blade and swiftly cut 
through the falling line of wood, slicing it ruthlessly into two halves. 
Those two halves fell down to the ground, clattering with echoing noise. 
The Japanese man lowered the Fire Cutter and smirked. It would take a 
lot more than falling wood to bring him down. 

He turned to face his English rival. &quot;No offence, but that was-&quot;

&quot;Wind Cluster!&quot;

The marble black eyes of Setsuya Seisuji widened with panic as a 
twirling cyclone of compressed air travelled through the gap between the 
two fighters with enormous speed. It was too sudden to block. Far too 
sudden. Setsuya grit his teeth and covered his face as best he could 
from that position. His whole body was engorged with the great power of 
the Wind Cluster. It blew back his ponytail, his bangs, his bandana, his 
bomber jacket and made it hard to open his eyes. Nothing he could have 
done would have allowed him to stand his ground at that point. Setsuya 
scowled and cursed as he was thrown straight off his feet and blown 
right back across the oblong hall of the Holy Basilica. He came to a 
stop when his back rammed into the far wall, next to a wall mounting of 
a Holy Cross. His body jerked with the severity of the wind and impact, 
coughing a little. But strangely enough, Setsuya couldn&#39;t help but smile 
at this. Not only had Aarin tapped the magical properties of the Wind 
Soul; he had also become a better tactician. The Air Wave Stroke on the 
beam from above was just a ploy. To distract Setsuya from the real 
issue. A magical attack. Not bad at all. Setsuya unhurriedly dragged his 
back out of the dent mark that had been made in the far wall and stepped 
back onto the floorboards of the church with both feet. He slowly 
proceeded to dust off his auburn hair and continued smiling, as Aarin 
stood across from him, motionlessly. 

Nonchalantly, Setsuya looked over at his opponent. &quot;Not bad. You&#39;ve 
definitely improved there, Aarin. But I haven&#39;t been idle for the past 
two years either.&quot;

&quot;I would imagine so.&quot; Aarin replied. Of course, he wanted energy spent 
on action, not words. Which was exactly what he was going to get. 
Setsuya levelled out the Fire Cutter with his own body and began running 
towards Aarin. Across that large gap that had been made between them by 
the force of the Wind Cluster. The English youth watched this intently. 
A frontal assault? That would not work any better on him than that 
defensive stance as previously taken by Setsuya. The Japanese man came 
at the English one as swiftly as his legs would allow with the Fire 
Cutter as the lead of attack. Aarin pulled Wind Soul into a defensive 
position and awaited the attack which came sharply. Setsuya swung his 
sword around the length of his body whilst stepping in stride. Aarin 
parried the blow with his vertical guard. Then Setsuya stepped back with 
a smile on his face. Aarin took the opportunity he had been waiting for 
and slashed at Setsuya from the front. Which was just what Setsuya had 
been expecting. The brown-haired boy leapt upwards from that position 
before even confirming Aarin&#39;s action. The blade of the Wind Soul swept 
through the air and nothing else. And so Aarin looked up to see what 
Setsuya was doing. The other man vaulted up high enough to grip one of 
the rafters that hung above them. He held on tightly to the wooden beam. 
Then, whilst sheathing Fire Cutter with his free hand, Setsuya swung 
himself around the length of the beam until he rotated his body around 
it. Allowing him to stand on the thing in a crouched position. 

Aarin looked confused. Just what good would that do? Setsuya knew that 
Aarin could just cut that rafter down and that he would come down with 
it. The blonde-haired young man looked up at this but did nothing to 
dissuade Setsuya from this action. At the heart of it all; Aarin wanted 
to win this fight. He bent forwards a little then concentrated his force 
on the blade in his hands. Another Air Wave Stroke would do the trick. 
And following this action, Aarin gave another. He slashed ruthlessly 
through the air, aiming at the rafter that Setsuya was standing. 
Invoking the power of the Air Wave Stroke. Setsuya stayed perfectly 
still as the slash cut through the weakening-with-age wood that made up 
that beam. But as the wooden beam began to fall, Aarin&#39;s eyes went wide. 
Setsuya was not falling along with it. The image of Setsuya still hung 
in the air even when the rafter he was standing on was crashing to the 
ground. Aarin couldn&#39;t understand it. Until he noticed that the image of 
Setsuya faded from view. What on earth did that mean?

&quot;How could he-?&quot;

Aarin couldn&#39;t finish. The second he spoke he heard the sound of a blade 
moving through air. It was unmistakable. Without looking back he hoisted 
Wind Soul above his head in a vertical position. The clash between two 
swords echoed again in the Holy Basilica. The two held each other to a 
standstill. And then Setsuya stepped back from the sword lock, whilst 
crouching downwards. The length of his leg followed him as he span 
around in point on the wooden floorboards. Until Setsuya&#39;s brown boot 
rammed into Aarin&#39;s. The blonde swordfighter grunted with the impact and 
was swept straight off his feet. He toppled over onto the ground, face 
down. Setsuya stood upright, redrew Fire Cutter, then jumped up again. 
But this time he had a plan of attack. He took a deep breath and focused 
his force into the Fire Cutter. The attention of his whole body was 
placed inside that one sword. Flames soon burst over it. Bright 
orange-red fire that gave a healthy glow to the church. He slashed 
downwards towards Aarin. 

&quot;Burn Shell!&quot;

Setsuya&#39;s motion brought along the power of magical fire into the real 
world. His flames rotated around themselves and shot down at Aarin in a 
spherical ball of flaming power. Aarin felt the sudden increase in heat 
from up above and acted. He tightened his grip over the Wind Soul and 
dragged himself up onto his knees. Then rolled forwards with as much 
speed as possible. He rolled and rolled until he got back up onto his 
feet. Just in time to avoid the strength of the Burn Shell. The flaming 
magical ball collided with the floorboards of the Holy Basilica. There 
was a brief explosion. Chips and fragments of wood were blown up into 
the air. Along with the embers and cinders. Waves of grey smoke passed 
along the floors from the sweeping force released by the impact. Aarin 
covered his mouth with the back of his hand to prevent from inhaling any 
of it. A crater had been left in the smoke clouds. About a metre wide 
and twenty centimetres deep. With Setsuya landing just a little ways 
behind it. With the Fire Cutter in hand, which still burned with bright 
fire. The two looked at each other from across that divide. Both smiled. 
But neither smile was forced or born of amateurish overconfidence. They 
were twin smiles of excitement and happiness. To know that they had 
finally found a decent challenge for each other. And even more so for 
Aarin. Because he had actually forgotten about Setsuya&#39;s After Image 
ability. He must have used it back on the rafters. That was a technique 
he had invented during the Yuuga School days. It was one move that Aarin 
was never able to learn. But it made them equals. It was a perfect 
counter strategy for the Air Wave Stroke. 

The flames from the Burn Shell shone brightly in the Holy Basilica of 
the Fallen Ones. But their dancing was ignored while Aarin and Setsuya 
narrowed down on each other. There was nothing quite like a battle 
between rivals. And this one held much weight in both their hearts. 
Enough to forget their problems and just concentrate on the fight at 
hand. But when you had two fighters as equally matched as Setsuya and 
Aarin, it did beg the question...

...Who would win?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Sugano Warehouse, Kuji, Neo-Japan

It was times like these that allowed Ayame to appreciate the urban life 
for what it was. The sounds, smells, sights. In the far beyond of the 
stone walls of this warehouse, you could hear the sounds of nearby dogs 
barking. The chime of police sirens. The dripping of oil that leaked 
from the old machinery that was strewn out all over this abandoned 
warehouse of Sugano. Ayame had found it by chance but it looked like a 
good place to hide out for the moment. The Neo-Japanese woman sat with 
her legs crossed, Nobunaga unsheathed and rested upon her wrapped legs. 
Next to her was a small towel and a jar of rubbing acid. Ayame poured a 
little of the rubbing acid onto the paper towel. Then lifted up Nobunaga 
with her free hand and began smoothly running the towel over the edge of 
the sword. The last time she had sharpened it was during the effort that 
she had made to bring Julia to Simon. That was three months ago. And 
though it had not seen much action up until now, she felt that it needed 
to be re-sharpened. She began the process. As she did this, Ayame looked 
over at Julia. She was laid out over a small blanket, asleep. As soon as 
the upper floor of the Tavern exploded, the two of them made for a safe 
place. They couldn&#39;t go back to their apartment because if Ras had 
survived then it would be the first logical place for him to go. They 
made a trek across town and reached a whole new district. As far as they 
could go without actually leaving Kuji. By the time they found Sugano 
Warehouse, it was morning, and Julia was exhausted. So they spent the 
day here. Now it was night again. Another day had passed and they were 
safe. But if Ras was still alive (doubtful, but...) then they would have 
to keep moving to avert him. And Ayame had to be ready to defend Julia 
against anything else the Shougatsu might send. 

Then Julia began to stir a little. Ayame&#39;s silvery eyes looked downwards 
as she heard Julia mutter to herself, just before her eyelids began to 
flutter open. The Scottish girl&#39;s restored green eyes looked up slowly 
to see Ayame sharpening her sword, with a small smile across her lips. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Ayame said, &quot;Finally awake yet? We don&#39;t have to leave for 
another two or three hours so, you can sleep till then if you&#39;d like.&quot;

Julia balled up her hand and rubbed her eyes. &quot;What... are you doing at 
this hour?&quot;

&quot;Giving Nobunaga a bit of a spit polish,&quot; Ayame answered, brandishing 
the katana before the brown-haired girl, &quot;I don&#39;t think having it has 
done me much good in the battles against that thing from the Research 
Facility. Nobunaga can barely scratch through its armour. So having it 
sharpened might not come to much... but at least its something. I should 
probably look into buying a newer, stronger sword. But weapons of this 
strength don&#39;t come cheap.&quot;

Julia then leaned up from her blanket. &quot;Have you slept at all today?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Replied the Dark Katana, &quot;I got a few hours shuteye a 
while ago but that&#39;s it. I need to stay awake in case something else 
comes after you. I wouldn&#39;t want for you to be attacked or something 
while I&#39;m snoozing on the job.&quot;

And to that, Julia smiled. &quot;...You should stop worrying about me like 
that. You&#39;ve already done so much to protect me from the Shougatsu 
Financial Group... the least you deserve is a good night&#39;s rest.&quot;

Ayame yawned a little, sheathing Nobunaga. &quot;Maybe. But protecting you is 
part of my job, remember? I can&#39;t fail at that.&quot;

At that point, Julia&#39;s smile lessened. &quot;Is that how you see me?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;As your mission. Your charge.&quot; Julia put forth, &quot;Is that really how you 
see me? After all this time we&#39;ve been together is that how little you 
think of me?&quot;

Talk about taking a comment in the wrong way. Ayame blinked at this. How 
could Julia even think something like that? Sure, Ayame started this 
whole thing for the money, but it wasn&#39;t like that now. &quot;...Look, I 
didn&#39;t mean it like that.&quot;

Julia looked away, frowning. &quot;...Well. At least I know where I stand 
with you.&quot;

&quot;I said that I didn&#39;t mean it like that,&quot; Ayame re-emphasised, &quot;That&#39;s 
not how I see you at all. I mean, sure, at first you were just my meal 
ticket. A way for me to get a lot of money real quick. But... then we 
spent the last three months together. And I got to see how wonderful and 
sweet and kind you are. Even to people who really don&#39;t deserve it. I 
know I might not say it much... you do mean a lot to me. More than you 
really understand, I think.&quot;

Just as Julia&#39;s previous smile faded, so did her current frown, which 
was replaced by a fresh new smile from the heart. &quot;...Ayame...&quot;

The Neo-Japanese woman shook her head. &quot;I mean it. I do care about you. 
I mean, do you really think I&#39;d really stick my neck out against 
something like Ras es-Shamrah for someone I didn&#39;t care about or like? 
Come on, Julia, you know me better than that.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Julia looked downwards, with a sheepish smile, &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t have said that. It&#39;s just... sometimes I get worried. It&#39;s a 
really hurtful feeling to care for someone more than they care for you. 
And I don&#39;t want it to be like that between the two of us.&quot;

&quot;Well it isn&#39;t.&quot; Ayame assured. 

But Julia wasn&#39;t so sure about that. &quot;...Isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t I just tell you that it wasn&#39;t?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s not what I mean,&quot; Julia replied, shaking her head, &quot;I like you a 
lot as a friend, Ayame. But... sometimes I wish we weren&#39;t friends. 
Sometimes I wish... that...&quot;

The blush that now appeared on both girl&#39;s faces suddenly made clear the 
point that Julia was trying to put through. By now Julia had inched 
herself a little closer to Ayame. The two young women looked at each 
other with a genuine honesty that both of them couldn&#39;t have understood 
at that point. Neither gaze was probing, begging for answers in sea of 
questions that only the other could answer. But their exchanged looks 
presented emotion, as well as the tint of fear that they both carried 
for putting their hearts on the line for such an action. But that brief 
tranquil look they shared was then shattered by violent burst of pent up 
lust and suppressed desire. Ayame locked her eyes shut and gripped Julia 
by her soft cheeks in a gentle but possessive touch. Julia closed her 
own eyes and exhaled desperately as Ayame&#39;s lips lunged at her own, 
claiming a kiss that neither girl had expected from the other. The 
Scottish girl in the arms of the Neo-Japanese one parted her lips and 
wound her hands into the bark of Ayame&#39;s jet black hair, which had been 
released from its usual ponytail. The two sat there and kissed, for the 
moment, forgetting their troubles. And now it had just dawned on Ayame 
that she had broken her first law of mission work.

Never fall in love with your charge.

But when you meet with someone like Julia McAmish...

...Who could blame her?
