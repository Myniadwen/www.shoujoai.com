<a href="../original/dreamday-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>In the girl&#39;s washroom Kris splashed water on her face, then turned to 
Sarah who was sitting on the edge of the sink counter. &quot;Why do you keep 
helping me?&quot; Kris finally asked.

Sarah watched her reflection in the mirror, &quot;I told you already.&quot; She 
said without turning away from the mirror. 

&quot;You told me that you liked the fact that I was honest about wanting to 
be left alone.&quot; Kris straightened up, &quot;That doesn&#39;t explain why you are 
here right now.&quot;

Sarah let her forehead rest on the mirror and closed her eyes, &quot;Will, &#39;I 
just wanted an excuse not to finish the assignment.&#39; work for you?&quot; She 
rolled her head around and gave Kris a tiny smile. 

&quot;You were right.&quot; Kris turned on her heels, &quot;You really aren&#39;t much 
better than Shannon is.&quot; She said as she stormed out of the washroom. 
She was getting more frustrated with herself and Sarah. Was the girl 
playing games with her heart or was she really concerned about Kris&#39;s 
well-being? 

Sarah looked at herself in the mirror again until she could hear the 
door shut. She than jumped off of the counter and ran after Kris. 

Kris was already rounding the corner. She wanted to get her things from 
class and leave. She was sick and tired of everything. She didn&#39;t care 
that she had Art class next period she just wanted out of this looney 
bin and sleep. Maybe she wouldn&#39;t go home after all. 

&quot;Kris, wait up!&quot; Kris heard Sarah call out, nevertheless this time Kris 
didn&#39;t slow or stop. Sarah eventually caught up to Kris and fell into 
pace beside her. Sarah looked at her friend and could see anger in the 
girls eyes. &quot;Ummm...&quot; Sarah began struggling with what to say when she 
was cut off by Kris abruptly grabbed her by the shoulders and slamming 
her hard against the wall. 

&quot;What do you want from me?&quot; Kris straight out asked, she felt her grip 
on reality slipping. She didn&#39;t want to hurt Sarah, but was growing 
tired of the strain this girl was causing on her own heart.

&quot;Oww.&quot; Sarah said as tears began to fill her eyes, &quot;You&#39;re hurting me.&quot; 

Kris let go of the girl and stepped back. She watched Sarah rub her 
arms. She couldn&#39;t believe she was acting so childish. &quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 
Kris apologized mortified by her own actions. She quickly turned to run 
away when she felt Sarah grab the sleeve of her shirt.  

&quot;Wait.&quot; Sarah begged softly, almost sadly.

Kris&#39;s head sunk low and she let out a deep sigh. She couldn&#39;t find the 
strength to pull away any longer. When she spoke Sarah could hear the 
tiredness in her friend&#39;s voice, &quot;What is it?&quot;

Sarah stood there silently, Kris finally turned around to look at the 
girl. Sarah was staring at her shoes, standing on the side of one foot 
then the other like she always did when she was nervous. &quot;I... I was 
wondering...&quot; She said gazing around the hall nervously, &quot;If you were 
going to the Halloween Dance on Friday?&quot; She muttered.

Kris blinked in disbelief. Today alone she had hurt this girl in more 
ways than Kris could think of. By all rights Sarah should want nothing 
to do with her. Yet here the girl was inviting her to a dance, &quot;What?&quot; 
Kris was so confused by this sudden change in conversation, that she 
found her voice gettting caught in her throat.

Sarah pointed at a small poster that announcing that the first dance of 
the school year was only a few weeks away and that everyone should show 
up and party, &quot;I was going to go alone and thought if you were alone 
then we could... I don&#39;t know, maybe meet up outside or something like 
that.&quot; Sarah&#39;s last sentence drifted off as the girl realized how silly 
she was being. 

&#39;Had that much time really passed?&quot; Kris thought to herself, &#39;Is this 
girl really asking me to a dance?&#39; Kris still couldn&#39;t believe what was 
happening. She just pushed this girl against the wall and now she was 
being asked if she would accompany her to a dance. Kris ran a hand 
through her curly hair. This was all getting out of hand. She shook her 
head and walked away. Leaving Sarah by herself. 

Kris got back to class just in time to hear the bell telling her it was 
time to move to the next class. The door opened and kids started to file 
out heading to their chosen extra classes. Sarah finally arrived and 
stood behind Kris as they waited for a chance to get into the class. 
Jason stepped out of the class and looked passed Kris to Sarah. His eyes 
caught her for a moment. Sarah looked down at the floor. He turned to 
Kris to give her a glare, however Kris didn&#39;t notice as she slipped
passed him and gathered her things. Sarah also avoided Jason&#39;s glares 
and closely followed her friend. 

&quot;Kris?&quot; Mrs. Brookholds called out as the girl rushed over to get her 
back pack, &quot;Can I speak to you for a moment?&quot; Kris stopped in her tracks 
and slowly looked over at her teacher to see that Mrs. Brookholds was 
holding her notebook. 

Kris looked around to see the class was almost empty. Sarah was the only 
one left. She gave Kris one last look before running out of the room. 
Kris felt her heart sink to her stomach. Slowly she walked over to the 
corner of the teacher&#39;s desk. 

Mrs. Brookholds held Kris&#39;s notebook out in front of her, &quot;Very good. 
You&#39;ll need to work on sentence structure and punctuation more, 
nevertheless all in all a good start just like your other works.&quot; She 
held the book out. 

Kris cautiously took her book back and held it to her chest. When she 
spoke her voice was small and distant. &quot;Thank you.&quot; She began to turn 
away when the teacher spoke again. 

&quot;Is there something you would like to talk about?&quot; When Mrs. Brookholds 
spoke there was a motherly quality to her voice, if she was truly 
concerned for her student, &quot;I don&#39;t have another class so I&#39;m all yours 
if need be.&quot;

Kris turned back to her teacher. She opened her mouth to speak, however 
no words came out. She was about to say that it was alright, that she 
would be fine, but the only sound she could muster was a choked sob, 
&quot;I...&quot; She felt her hold on her emotions beginning to slip like a 
mudslide on a rainy day. There was so much on her mind and all she 
wanted was to go home, to be left alone with her misery and pain. Or at 
least that is what she thought she wanted. Kris tried again to speak 
this time was stopped by the sensation of a tear rolling down her cheek. 
She brought a hand up to wipe the tear away, however the more she wiped 
at them, the more began to fall. She struggled to regain control of 
herself. She was older than this. She wasn&#39;t a child anymore. She didn&#39;t 
cry. Kris felt her legs give out from under her and she sunk to the 
ground in a heap. 

Mrs. Brookholds rushed over to the girl&#39;s side and gave her a hug, &quot;It 
is alright, let it out dear.&quot; She rubbed the child&#39;s back as Kris let 
out a heaving sob. It was like all the emotion she had been holding in 
that past few weeks rushed forwards. The loss of her closest friend, the 
need to be held, the urge to be touched. All of it came out in a mass of 
heaving sobs. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kris kept repeating over and over again, &quot;I don&#39;t want to 
hurt anyone. I want to be left alone. Why won&#39;t everyone leave me 
alone?&quot; She asked between sobs. She was so tired. All she wanted to do 
was sleep and never wake up. It was not like there was a use for her in 
this world. The doctors told her she would not last to her twentieth 
birthday so why was she struggling so hard to live? Why didn&#39;t she just 
give up?  She was just a pathetic little child. Nothing special, why 
couldn&#39;t people see that? Mrs. Brookholds held Kris and for the first 
time in years Kris let herself be a child again. She curled up in the 
woman&#39;s arms and let the pain wash over her.   

Kris didn&#39;t know how long she was in Mrs. Brookholds class. Time seemed 
to wash together in her mind&#39;s eye. After a while she was able to regain 
control over her emotions, or was it that she had finally let go of 
enough of the pain to be able to face the world once again? When she 
finally able was to regain control the final bell announcing the end of 
another school day rang. She slowly uncurled herself from her teacher&#39;s 
lap and wiped the remaining tears away, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; she mumbled again. 

&quot;It is alright,&quot; Mrs. Brookholds soothed softly, helping the girl to her 
feet, &quot;I could tell from your writing that something was paining you 
deeply.&quot; She grabbed a tissue from her pocket and dried the girl&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;If you ever want to talk things over you know where to find me.&quot; She 
said with a warm smile.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Kris sniffled, &quot;There is so much on my mind I have no idea 
what is going on.&quot;

&quot;Then if you need someone to bounce things off of feel free to visit 
me.&quot; The teacher patted the girl on the shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about 
your fifth period class. I&#39;ll tell them that you were here helping me 
out.&quot; 

Kris took one last deep breath, &quot;Thank you again.&quot; She turned before 
stepping out of the classroom and into the hall filled with students.
