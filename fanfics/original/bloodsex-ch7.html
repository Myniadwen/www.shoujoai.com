<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 7 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        Alice Sinclare didn&#39;t know what woke her up, finally. It 
might have been the birds calling outside, or maybe the scent of her 
coffee pot starting up, but something roused her from a dreamless 
slumber. Rubbing her eyes Alice sat up, her black hair flowing over 
her shoulders, blinking in surprise at the note sitting on the bed 
beside her.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the elegant script read. &quot;I never thought that 
what happened in the Shop could occur, or else I would have taken 
greater precautions. I&#39;ll try to explain it later tonight, if you&#39;ll 
let me.&quot; Underneath it was simply signed, &quot;Jess.&quot;

        &quot;Oh god,&quot; the note fell from Alice&#39;s nerveless hands as 
memory rushed back to her. The strange woman in the book shop, Jess 
and her two friends arriving, the sudden attack on her then.. just a 
blank. When she had come to there was a greasy burnt spot on the 
carpet, Jess was carrying her in her arms, and she had mild hysterics.

        &quot;Or maybe not so mild,&quot; a blushing Alice quietly admitted to 
herself. Jess had taken her back here to her home, then she did.. 
something when she put her to bed. Whatever it was, Alice hadn&#39;t 
slept that soundly in years, if ever.

        The coffee pot made that odd &#39;whuf&#39; noise it did when it was 
done perking, and Alice walked over in her nightie to pour herself a 
cup, adding sugar and coffee-mate as needed. She sat down at the 
kitchen table, munching a donut out of the bread box as she tried to 
wake up.

        And thought about Jess. &#39;What do I really know about her?&quot; 
Alice mused. There were so many outlandish stories about the woman in 
the community that she had a hard time separating fact from fiction. 
She ran a tattoo parlor, had for at least two years, that was 
confirmed. She was an expert, if that meant anything, but her past 
was awfully murky.

        Most people in the city had at least heard about the Lady 
Diana, for instance. The woman crimelord was an enigma herself, but 
at least some of the stories connected Jess to her. But oddly, at 
about the same time Diana completely dropped out of sight Jess opened 
up her tattoo shop. And then she began taking jobs for the bare 
minimum, if not often helping people for free.

        &quot;Gah,&quot; Alice shook her head firmly. It was getting close 
enough to the time to go that she walked back to her bedroom to find 
some clean clothes. She dressed herself quickly, the business formal 
clothes sliding on, then she combed out her black hair and brushed 
her teeth. Grabbing her purse she was out the door and gone.

        Not long after Alice pushed open the door, the bell secured 
above the door ringing as she entered. The place looked much the 
same, the video rack on one side, clothes and other items over there, 
and the main body of the store the books and magazines. She found 
herself searching for any sign of what happened last night, but the 
place was spotless.

        &quot;Hey,&quot; Hunter looked up from her place at the counter, &quot;did 
you get a cleaning service in or something?&quot; The lanky buzzcut blonde 
looked around her in admiration, &quot;The place is spotless.&quot;

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Alice smiled back wryly. She walked 
around the little shop, hesitating where she had seen the fire, but 
the carpet was unmarked. &quot;Anyone in yet?&quot; she asked as she went back 
up to the till.

        &quot;Nobody yet,&quot; Hunter shrugged slightly. Her T-shirt was 
spotless, the blue jeans that she wore hugging her slim body. The two 
made an odd looking pair with Alice in her business wear, but they 
worked quite well together.

        Alice hesitated a moment. She had known Hunter for several 
years, since she had opened up the shop, and she trusted her 
opinion. &quot;What do you think of Jessica Drake?&quot; she finally asked.

        Hunter gave a slight smile, &quot;I wondered when you&#39;d ask.&quot; She 
chuckled softly, taking a drink from a nearby cup of coffee, &quot;She&#39;s 
been by a few times when you&#39;re not here, always looks a bit 
disappointed when she sees me up here alone.&quot;

        &quot;Oh,&quot; Alice found herself blushing.

        &quot;Hey, it&#39;s all right,&quot; Hunter said, &quot;considering how many of 
my girlfriends come here it&#39;s about time you got one. Anyway,&quot; she 
shook her head, &quot;Jess Drake is a good woman.&quot;

        It was a simple statement of fact, with no additions or 
further explanation. &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Alice blinked at her in surprise.

        &quot;There&#39;s a lot of stuff people don&#39;t talk about, odd things 
that we don&#39;t repeat,&quot; Hunter said entirely seriously. &quot;Drake helped 
some friends of mine, and I really doubt they&#39;d even be around 
without her,&quot; she finished firmly.

        &quot;Wow,&quot; Alice murmured softly.

        &quot;I know that she&#39;s got a bad rep,&quot; Hunter continued on, &quot;and 
she&#39;s probably got some things in her past she&#39;s not proud of.&quot; A wry 
smile, &quot;But don&#39;t we all.&quot; And with that she pushed off from where 
she was leaning up against the counter and went to start restocking 
the shelves.

        Alice nodded to herself thoughtfully even as she got out the 
books and began to run through the amounts, stopping to serve the 
regulars as they came inside. Business was brisk, but still she found 
her thoughts frequently turning to Jess.

        Finally, as the sun was setting just behind the buildings as 
the door bell rang out. Jess walked inside confidently, her short 
black hair neatly combed back from her handsome face. Her jeans and 
leather jacket suited the striking young woman well, and she simply 
ignored the soft murmurs of a few of the other customers.

        &quot;Hi,&quot; Jess gave her a tentative smile.

        Alice found herself smiling back, &quot;Hi, yourself. Give me a 
minute to let Hunter know that I&#39;m leaving, all right?&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Jess gave her a little wave, moving over to look at 
the latest novels.

        &quot;Hey, Hunter,&quot; Alice opened up the door to the storeroom. She 
froze in the doorway, then blurted out, &quot;Hunter!&quot;

        Both naked young women scrambled around for their clothes, 
Hunter giving her an mildly apologetic look. &quot;Sorry boss, got carried 
away,&quot; she laughed.

        Alice rolled her eyes and sighed, &quot;I&#39;m going on my break. Try 
not to get too distracted while I&#39;m gone, all right?&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Hunter grinned, shielding the still naked and 
clearly embarrassed young woman crouching behind her.

        Jess looked over at her curiously when Alice came out with 
her coat on. &quot;You&#39;ve got the oddest expression on your face,&quot; she 
ventured as the two of them left the bookstore, setting off together 
down the sidewalk.

        &quot;Hunter was entertaining someone in the back room,&quot; Alice 
grimaced. Jess blinked, then began to laugh, then Alice joined in.

        &quot;Having met her,&quot; Jess chuckled, &quot;I can see that.&quot;

        They walked on for a bit, the laughter dying off. &quot;I had so 
many questions earlier,&quot; Alice finally said softly, &quot;but now I can&#39;t 
think of any of them.&quot;

        &quot;I owe you an explanation,&quot; Jess said softly, &quot;if only 
because that.. thing showed up in the middle of your shop.&quot; The light 
from the street lamps shadowed her face, and in the deepening 
twilight she almost seemed a stranger.

        &quot;What was that thing,&quot; Alice finally asked softly, &quot;and why 
were you and your friends fighting against it?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll start with why I was fighting it,&quot; Jess said 
softly, &quot;you see, I&#39;m not just a tattoo artist. Or I&#39;m not a normal 
tattoo artist, anyway. I also know a bit of magic.&quot;

        &quot;Magic,&quot; Alice echoed weakly.

        Jess cupped her hand, speaking a single work. A spark of 
light and fire danced there, a fireball hovering above her fingers 
until she closed her hand, the flames disappearing. &quot;And with this 
sort of power comes certain responsibilities, so to speak,&quot; Jess said.

        &quot;Responsibilities like fighting that woman that hurt me,&quot; 
Alice murmured.

        &quot;It wasn&#39;t really a woman,&quot; Jess explained, &quot;it was a 
creature from somewhere else, wearing the woman&#39;s skin to disguise 
itself. It needed to.. replace that skin, and it targeted you.&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Alice nodded. They walked on silently again, then she 
softly asked, &quot;If I continue to hang around you, will I run into 
something like that again?&quot;

        &quot;I hope not,&quot; Jess made a face, &quot;but I can&#39;t promise.&quot;

        Alice looked up at her, the tall, intense young woman. &quot;Let&#39;s 
hope not,&quot; she said, &quot;because I don&#39;t intend to run away.&quot; Without 
thinking about it she reached out to take Jess&#39; hand in hers.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Jess squeezed those fingers gently.
