<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>      Mina came over to Eveon&#39;s house bearing a memorable gift. Even if they couldn&#39;t spend 
the night out together like they planned, at least they could have a special moment 
together... Mina wasn&#39;t disappointed as soon as she saw her girlfriend&#39;s eyes light up.

      &quot;Oh, Mina...! You didn&#39;t have to make me a cake,&quot; Eveon said, though reasonably 
happy.

      &quot;I know... it&#39;s just our date got ruined, so why not?&quot; With that, she directed a look 
over at Abby and Sakura. &quot;I don&#39;t see why we couldn&#39;t have just gone on a double date with 
Seth and Tycara.&quot;

      The couple was actually in the living room, watching a movie. Sakura said quietly, 
&quot;Because of Tycara&#39;s heritage and the way the fiend was acting... I don&#39;t want to risk her 
either... give me a week to get this together?&quot;

      Mina shrugged. &quot;I guess there&#39;s nothing I can do... but what is a fiend anyway?&quot;

      Faye chose that time to pop into the hallway. She and Erin had been doing dishes 
but... &quot;Did I hear someone ask for a lesson in the history of the three races?&quot;

      Eveon and Mina exchanged looks. &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with sex, so 
I&#39;m surprised she wants to teach it to us,&quot; Mina said, perplexed.

      Faye frowned. &quot;Just get over here and share your cake.&quot;

      Tycara perked up at the sound of cake and dragged Seth over to the dining room to 
join the others. &quot;Alright,&quot; Faye said. &quot;Let&#39;s talk about the beginning of humanity!&quot;

      Erin was drying the dishes. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re telling them the origin story?&quot; The goddess 
paused. &quot;Well, it&#39;s not really a story since we&#39;ve been around since then.&quot;

      Faye nodded and turned back to her six listeners. Sakura already knew it by heart, 
but she paid attention anyways. 

***** 

      There existed a time before humans roamed the earth, when the land was desolate, but 
peaceful. A type of being lived quietly, resembling the people that now exist today. 
However, a great calamity caused by the unpredictable patterns of nature and the elements 
created the drive to survive.

      Many chose a path filled with tools, rationalization and wits. Those would become the 
humans today. Others chose to turn to a life piety and pure intentions. Those would become 
the angels that would use their holy powers to create the wings on their backs. Finally, 
the third and most diverse group was consisted of those who became demons.

      Of that group, some chose to live as one with nature, embrace their instinct and use 
the land for their survival. Those became the natural demons, those who gain their powers 
from the elements and the animals. The rest of the group seeped themselves in darkness and 
used deceit to benefit from the labors of the other races.

      At some point, that group known as chaos demons split. Many of them sought out the 
other races to procreate, which thinned out the evil blood within them and granted their 
ancestors the power of darkness without a tainted soul. The others kept to themselves, not 
wishing to abandon their ways. Those were the fiends, so few in power and kept shielded 
from the rest of the world.

      A great power embodied itself as the Creator and she decided to bring structure to 
the chaos. To the angels, she gave an isolated place to live since they despised 
interaction with the other races. To the demons, she began to stamp out the fiends and 
encouraged the others to cross breed. To the humans, most versatile of all the races, she 
gave them to power to be her servants.

      And those servants were to watch over all the races and the world. 

***** 

      &quot;And we are, of course, those wonderful servants,&quot; Faye said, with a smile. &quot;Sure, we 
don&#39;t do much anymore since everyone turned their backs on us, but whatever.&quot;

      Abby spoke up, &quot;Wait, if you&#39;re supposed to keep the world in balance, wasn&#39;t it 
stupid for you guys to be sealed away?&quot;

      Erin nodded her head. &quot;Yes, yes it was. It wasn&#39;t fun to be stuck like that. I 
mean... the earth hasn&#39;t been as good as it should be and same with the weather and such. 
You can blame a lot of the things on technology, but without the rests of the gods around, 
everything isn&#39;t as good as it could be.&quot;

      Faye shrugged. &quot;At least it isn&#39;t as bad as how it could be. Without us around... 
everyone will just have to take care of themselves.&quot;

      Eveon looked confused. &quot;...so who was the Creator?&quot;

      Erin brightened up. &quot;Oh right! I totally forgot about her.&quot;

      Faye looked at her over her shoulder. &quot;The Creator? How could you forget about the 
one who made us...?&quot;

      The snake goddess looked sheepish. &quot;Well, it&#39;s been such a long time since she was 
sealed...&quot;

      It was then that the two goddess noticed the questioning stares of their audience. 
&quot;Creator...&quot; Seth murmured, looking through one of his books. &quot;Like God?&quot;

      Erin shook her head. &quot;No, not exactly. She&#39;s more like me and Faye, but much more 
powerful. It was originally a powerful entity with no driving will until it possessed the 
body of a young woman. After that, she began to use her powers...&quot; Erin trailed off. &quot;The 
powers me and Faye have are actually fragments of what she had.&quot;

      &quot;And every other god as well. But... she was sealed away...a good five hundred years 
before me and Erin met,&quot; Faye said. &quot;I wasn&#39;t a part of the sealing-&quot;

      &quot;Oh, I was there,&quot; Erin said with a slight smile. &quot;We had to remove her from the 
vessel and lock her up... it was most definitely hard.&quot;

      Tycara tilted her head in confusion. &quot;Why? If she was really powerful, why didn&#39;t you 
keep her around...?&quot;

      &quot;Because she was much too powerful than anything on this earth and she could barely 
stand to keep a physical form, even with  a vessel,&quot; Erin said.

      Faye took the cake from Mina and put it next to a plate. &quot;Pretend this cake is the 
power and spirit of our Creator. This plate is how much a human vessel can hold. And that&#39;s 
being generous,&quot; she said, motioning to the much smaller plate. &quot;If you can imagine how 
painful it is to become just a normal god, think about the vessel of the Creator. It&#39;s 
hell.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s why we had to seal her up. It was inevitable that her vessel would die from 
the power, unless she used it all or had some of it come off of her as different objects, 
like... like...&quot; Erin suddenly pointed at Tycara. &quot;You use those six swords as though they 
are a part of your body, but they aren&#39;t right?&quot;

      The hybrid nodded and Mina caught on. &quot;So she has to have lots of magical detachments 
to keep from destroying her body?&quot;

      Faye let out a sigh. &quot;Unfortunately. If she&#39;d been around when the gods were being 
killed, I&#39;m sure nothing would have happened... but it&#39;s much better if she&#39;s sealed away. 
Her power is so volatile that if put in the wrong hands...&quot;

      Eveon frowned at the thought. &quot;But how in the world would that even happen? I mean, 
wouldn&#39;t she be in complete control?&quot;

      The two goddesses exchange glances. &quot;You see,&quot; Erin started. &quot;We had to run girls 
through tests to make sure they were qualified to be the vessel. The power itself does have 
a personality, but it can be easily overridden and the trauma it puts on the vessel can 
lead the Creator to being easily manipulated.&quot;

      &quot;At least, right now, the Gate to where she sleeps is completely secure. Only a human 
can open it and only a human who&#39;s been deemed worthy by...&quot; Faye trailed off. &quot;Shoot, I 
can&#39;t remember who has the power to grant worthiness to humans...&quot;

      Erin shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s not that important since it won&#39;t ever happen. The only chance 
would be in a catastrophe.&quot;

      Mina looked across the table. &quot;Can I... uh, have my cake back?&quot; 

***** 

      The rest of the evening went smoothly with the two goddesses effectively distracting 
Eveon&#39;s mothers. So, it ended up with the two of them in Eveon&#39;s room, under the covers. 
The blonde giggled a bit as Mina reached out to stroke her hair. It didn&#39;t take long for 
the girl to initiate a kiss with Eveon.

      In the back of her mind, Eveon thought about Faye&#39;s gift... which she was currently 
wearing. Would such a thing really make a difference if it was dark in her room and they 
were really only making out and groping? At some point, Eveon stopped caring and just 
worried about pleasing her girlfriend.

      Suddenly, Mina was on top, slowly undoing the buttons on her shirt. She was looking 
at Eveon expectantly, who just smiled and let her girlfriend do her work. Mina had just 
laid a hand gently on one of Eveon&#39;s lacy lingerie clad breast, when a distant ringing 
could be heard. Eveon shot up out of surprise and Mina just turned around to look at the 
door.

      The ring came again and Eveon sighed. &quot;Oh... it&#39;s the doorbell...&quot; They went back to 
kissing, but the ring came again. Eveon got up this time, much to Mina&#39;s disappointment.

      &quot;Sorry, it might be a customer so just hang out here,&quot; Eveon said, buttoning up her 
shirt. Apparently her mommy was too busy to answer it...

      &quot;Okay, just come back,&quot; Mina whispered and gave her a kiss.

      Eveon walked out of her room, down the dark hallway, down the stairs, all to get to 
the door. She paused before opening it, thinking back on the fiend from the night before. 
It... couldn&#39;t be the same guy, right? With a tired sigh, she pulled open the door and 
startled the person behind it.

      It was a 16 year old girl, her black hair pulled back in a short, wayward ponytail 
and her green eyes looked surprised in the dark night. She was wearing a jacket and jeans, 
with a knapsack on her back and... there was a sword strapped to the back of her belt.

      &quot;Are you an evil demon?&quot; Eveon asked simply and the girl just shook her head in 
confusion. &quot;Alright, welcome to our wonderful bed and breakfast at this ungodly hour of the 
night.&quot; Eveon stifled a yawn as the girl stepped in inside and wiped her dirty boots on the 
house mat.

      &quot;Th-thank you,&quot; she said nervously.

      &quot;Do you want a room or...?&quot;

      The girl shook her head. &quot;No, I&#39;m just... here to, um...&quot; She looked down at the 
ground, her arms wrapped protectively around herself.

      &quot;Do you want something to eat?&quot; Eveon asked, trying to get the girl to be more 
comfortable. She nodded quickly and Eveon led her to the dining room table.

      The blonde disappeared into the kitchen to prepare a sandwich and brought it out to 
the young girl. &quot;Here you go,&quot; Eveon said, sitting down across from the girl as she ate.

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured, as though lost in thought.

      &quot;...Eveon...?&quot; The blonde perked up at the mention of her name and saw a very tired 
Abby coming downstairs. &quot;...oh...? A guest at this hour...?&quot;

      &quot;I... I didn&#39;t mean to come so late,&quot; the girl said in between bites of her sandwich.

      Abby shrugged and waited patiently for her to finish. &quot;Uh... how much...?&quot; the girl 
asked suddenly.

      Eveon, who had started dozing off, didn&#39;t understand what she meant. &quot;This is a bed a 
breakfast, so how much was it for the sandwich?&quot; The girl started to root through her 
pockets, before pulling out a five dollar bill.

      Abby exchanged glances with Eveon. &quot;That&#39;s kind of a lot for a sandwich,&quot; the young 
mother said, but she took the money anyways.

      The girl began to chug the water that came with her meal and Eveon tried not to 
laugh. &quot;You&#39;re going to drown yourself.&quot;

      The girl stopped and sheepishly put down the glass with a slight smile. &quot;I was 
thirsty.&quot; It was then that Abby came back, holding a plastic wrapped sandwich.

      &quot;Here, five dollars is enough to get you an extra for the road,&quot; Abby said and the 
girl took it thankfully before putting it into her knapsack. &quot;So, what are you here for? A 
meal? A room?&quot;

      The girl sat up in her chair awkwardly. &quot;I...&quot; She swallowed. &quot;I heard that this was 
where I could find... the woman who was once the Living Inferno.&quot;

      Eveon tilted her head in confusion before looking at her mom. &quot;Where do you think she 
heard that?&quot;

      Abby shrugged, but she had a very serious expression on her face. &quot;Exactly why are 
you looking for her? If you&#39;re a fiend-&quot;

      The girl shook her head. &quot;No, I&#39;m not. It&#39;s because of fiends that I need her help. I 
just... heard it from rumors, so I&#39;ve been looking for her.&quot;

      The young mother headed towards the stairs to go get Sakura. There was an awkward 
silence as Eveon took her plate. The girl waited patiently and then could hear someone 
coming downstairs... but she could also hear two women talking.

      She turned around in her chair to see an angel coming towards her and she was 
shocked. Sakura looked down at the girl, summing her up quickly and determined that she was 
a normal human... not even an exorcist. Abby stood next to her lover and Eveon came back to 
the dining room in time to see the confrontation.

      &quot;I...&quot; The girl got up quickly to face Sakura. &quot;Please, I need your help! I don&#39;t 
have the sight and I need to break into-&quot;

      &quot;Break into?&quot; Sakura asked, her eyes widening.

      &quot;...yes... it&#39;s a base of the Shadow Organization that can only be seen-&quot;

      &quot;I can&#39;t help you,&quot; the angel said suddenly, cutting the girl off. &quot;Not right now, 
this isn&#39;t a good time.&quot;

      The girl&#39;s face fell. &quot;B-but...!&quot;

      &quot;My family is already at risk with fiends and I can&#39;t afford... to get involved with 
the Shadow Organization... they aren&#39;t exactly known for their good deeds,&quot; Sakura 
explained. &quot;I can&#39;t leave my family for a week... so please, you&#39;ll have to wait-&quot;

      &quot;I can&#39;t wait!&quot; The girl suddenly shouted. &quot;They&#39;re doing... things to people and the 
experiments... they&#39;re a threat to everyone, but they&#39;re keeping a prisoner at that 
facility. That&#39;s why I have to break in as soon as possible before it&#39;s too late.&quot;

      She looked around at Eveon and Abby. &quot;If anything happens to them while you&#39;re gone, 
then I&#39;ll help them. Please, but I just need you-&quot;

      &quot;Come back in a week,&quot; Sakura said sadly. &quot;Then I will help you with all my power.&quot;

      The girl let out a defeated sigh and looked down at the ground. &quot;We... can get you a 
room if you like,&quot; Eveon said suddenly.

      The green eyed girl just shook her head. &quot;No... no I have to get going. I&#39;ve got to 
find a way...&quot; She whispered the last part more to herself and after saying her thanks, 
left in a hurry.

      &quot;Why can&#39;t you just help her?&quot; Abby asked. &quot;Erin and Faye can keep us safe for a 
day.&quot;

      Sakura shook her head and looked at Abby. &quot;The Shadow Organization... I&#39;m quite sure 
they are connected to the fiends. Otherwise... she wouldn&#39;t have come to me...&quot; The angel 
trailed off. &quot;I&#39;m as strong as I used to be so I can&#39;t... just recklessly charge in.&quot; She 
stopped when Abby came over and gave her a hug.

      &quot;Alright, I trust your judgment, but...&quot; Abby motioned over to Eveon now asleep at 
the table. &quot;Let&#39;s take her to bed.&quot;
