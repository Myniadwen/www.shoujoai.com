<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 65 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch64.html">Back to Part 64</a><pre>Misty sat upon the lobby couch as she watched the office door, its 
blinded pulled shut to keep out prying eyes. Emily entered the room with 
a cup of water in hand and offered it the girl, &quot;Here you go Misty.&quot; She 
said, handing the cup over to her friend. 


&quot;Thank you.&quot; Misty took the cup gratefully and drained half of it. 

Emily sat down next to Misty and glanced at the door, &quot;How long do you 
think they will be in there for?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Misty simply shook her head, her eyes never moving from the door. 

Emily let out a sigh, &quot;Do you intend to wait here until they come out?&quot; 
She asked worriedly. 

Misty slowly nodded, &quot;I want to be here when Jessie comes out.&quot; 

Emily leaned back on the sofa and placed her arms along the back, 
&quot;You&#39;re really hopeless, you know that right?&quot; Misty did not return her 
remarks, &quot;What am I to do with you?&quot; Emily asked as she rolled her head 
on the back of the couch to see Tanya sitting at another circle of 
sofas. Deciding that she was not getting anywhere with Misty, she 
decided to try making friends with the new girl. Emily got up from her 
spot and circled around the couches to sit opposite Tanya, &quot;Hey!&quot; She 
greeted the girl with a small wave. 

Tanya slowly glanced up at Emily and back down at the table, &quot;Hi...&quot; She 
returned softly. 

Emily leaned over the coffee table to get a better look at the girl, &quot;Is 
it just me or is everyone here down today?&quot; She inquired indifferently. 

Tanya glanced up at the girl, &quot;Today has been one of those days it would 
seem.&quot; She remarked miserably. 

&quot;What could be so bad?&quot; Emily inquired ignorantly, &quot;I mean other then 
that redhead disappearing.&quot; 

Tanya glared, &quot;That girl saved me from the Western Woods.&quot; She stated 
coldly, &quot;She might not have been a close friend but she meant something 
to us.&quot; 

Emily suddenly pointed at Tanya, &quot;Hey! You&#39;re that girl that walked into 
the Western Woods aren&#39;t you? Wow I never thought I would meet anyone 
who lived through that. What&#39;s it like in there anyway?&quot; 

&quot;A living nightmare.&quot; Tanya remarked numbly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you walk in 
there and you will be able to tell all your friends about how cool it 
is.&quot; 

Emily frowned at this suggestion, &quot;Listen, I... I don&#39;t mean... Geez...&quot; 
She ruffled her bangs and flop back on the sofa, &quot;I&#39;m always messing up 
like this. I just wanted to say &#39;hi&#39;. I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.&quot; She 
glanced over at Misty, &quot;I really have troubles making friends. Always 
messing things up right away. Misty seems to be the only one who still 
talks to me.&quot; 

&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; Tanya inquired perplexedly. 

&quot;Because I... I thought... we could... be friends...&quot; She trailed off, 
feeling ashamed of herself for asking someone who she just recently 
insulted to be her friend, &quot;I thought since you are new here you might 
need some friends.&quot; 

&quot;I have all the friends I can need right here.&quot; Tanya remarked weakly. 

&quot;Then what is with the long face?&quot; Emily inquired, this time with a hint 
of concern. 

Tanya was not really sure if the girl was really concerned about her 
well being or was just trying to make conversation, but at that moment 
she was feeling alone and could really use someone to talk to, even if 
they are a complete stranger. She let out a deep breath and rubbed at 
her face, &quot;I had a fight with my girlfriend.&quot; She stated bluntly, not 
caring if the girl had a problem with her being a lesbian, but figured 
if she was a friend of Misty&#39;s then she must at least tolerate gays.

&quot;Ahhhh...&quot; Emily breathed knowingly, &quot;I think I recognized that look 
now. Misty usually gets the same expression on her face when she is down 
about Jessie.&quot; 

Misty suddenly sprung to life, &quot;Emily, don&#39;t go around telling people 
about my private life.&quot; She demanded. 

Emily raised a hand in defence, &quot;I have never told your secrets to 
anyone.&quot; She assured the girl, grinning brightly, &quot;But I do keep the 
juicy bits in a journal locked away for safe keeping.&quot; 

Misty flushed brightly, &quot;You do not... do you really?&quot; She inquired 
desperately. 

Emily shook her head, &quot;No, I just like to make you blush.&quot; She remarked 
with a giggle. 

Misty grabbed a pair of throw pillows and tossed them each at the girl, 
&quot;Emily!!! Why you!!!&quot; 

Emily laughed as she batted the pillows away, &quot;You should have seen the 
shocked look on your face. You really believed me for a moment there.&quot; 

Misty flopped upon the couch between Emily and Tanya and crossed her 
arms irately, &quot;I never believed a thing.&quot; 

Emily continued to laugh, &quot;And you are now sitting between us 
because...?&quot; She inquired curiously, &quot;What if your Jessie comes out of 
the office?&quot; 

&quot;Tanya looked to be in need of advice.&quot; Misty stated concernedly, &quot;I can 
hear if Jessie comes out of the room from here just fine.&quot; She turned to 
Tanya and smiled at the girl, &quot;So what seems to be the trouble? Does 
Cherilyn have too much of a wandering eye?&quot; She inquired with a grin. 

Tanya shook her head, &quot;No... nothing like that.&quot; 

Emily stared at Misty in shook, &quot;How do you know her girl already?&quot; She 
inquired in astonishment, &quot;How do you do that?&quot; 

Misty shrugged, &quot;They arrived while I was watching over Jessie and I 
helped with their boxes.&quot; She stated nonchalantly. 

&quot;You know everyone in this dorm, don&#39;t you?&quot; Emily grilled her friend. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Misty admitted, sheepishly, &quot;I have yet to really meet 
Kris or those other new girls.&quot; 

Emily crossed her arms, &quot;I give you a week to be talking to them all and 
being part of their circle of friends.&quot; 

&quot;This is not about me.&quot; Misty remarked and gestured to Tanya, whom was 
sitting watching the two girls in amusement, &quot;We are here to help our 
new friend, Tanya, out with her girl troubles.&quot; 

Emily frowned, &quot;How would I know how to help? I&#39;ve never had a 
boyfriend, never mind a girlfriend.&quot; 

Misty returned the scowl, &quot;Well that should not stop you from helping. 
You are always filled with advice when it comes to Jessie and me.&quot; She 
quickly turned to Tanya, slightly startling the girl, &quot;So what happened 
between you and your girl?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Tanya shifted in her spot, she was not sure she was comfortable with 
people referring the Cherilyn as her &#39;Girl&#39;, realizing these two would 
not let her go without an explanation she gave is and let out a deep 
sigh of defeat. &quot;We were trying to cheer Jenn up after she found out 
about Kris and Je...&quot; She stopped herself, realizing that she was 
talking to another of Jessica&#39;s girlfriends.

Misty only smiled, &quot;I know about Jessie&#39;s... activities...&quot; She stated, 
not really sure how to described Jessica&#39;s ways, &quot;You don&#39;t have to 
worry about mentioning who she was with around me.&quot; She stated with a 
slight twitch in her smile. 

Emily shook her head as she could see the pain her friend was in, but 
refrained from bringing it up. 

&quot;Well...&quot; Tanya nervously continued her story, &quot;Jenn was miserable and 
putting herself down, calling herself stupid and the like. Then I told 
her that I could never love someone who was stupid and that I loved 
her... right in front of Cherilyn.&quot; 

&quot;Ouch...&quot; Misty winced and tried to consider how to reply, &quot;Well... I 
see why she would be angry with you.&quot; She stated uneasily. 

Tanya lowered her head, &quot;She probably hates me.&quot; She mumbled 
sorrowfully. 

Misty glanced at the ceiling in thought, then at the front doors, &quot;Not 
likely.&quot; She stated confidently, &quot;She is probably pissed off as hell, 
but I heard that she followed you into the Western Woods and back. So I 
don&#39;t think she would be willing to give up on you so simply.&quot; 

&quot;I still feel horrible.&quot; Tanya stated, &quot;I love Jenn like a sister and 
wish I could explain that I love Cherilyn more then anything else in the 
world.&quot; She remarked with a sigh. 

A pair of arms wrapped around Tanya from behind, startling the girl and 
making her spin around to see Cherilyn standing behind her. A smile upon 
her face, &quot;I love you too, you silly girl.&quot; 

&quot;Cherilyn!?!&quot; Tanya exclaimed, &quot;How long? I mean? Did you hear all of 
that?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s your girlfriend?&quot; Emily inquired in confusion, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
didn&#39;t know or I would have said something. She has been standing behind 
you for a while now.&quot; 

Cherilyn hugged Tanya tight from behind, &quot;I think things worked out 
alright. Thank you.&quot;

Tanya looked up at Cherilyn, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I never meant to hurt 
you.&quot; She repeated sincerely. 

&quot;Why don&#39;t you come help me finish unpacking our room and we can talk 
about it?&quot; Cherilyn suggested with a nod towards the stairs. 

Tanya took Cherilyn by the hand and allowed herself to be pulled around 
the couch, &quot;Thank Misty!&quot; She called out to the girl, &quot;And you too 
Emily.&quot; She said with a wave. 

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Misty waved back to the two girls as they disappeared up 
the stairs. 

Suddenly the door to the office opened and the occupants spilled out 
into the lobby. 

&quot;Thank you for letting me stay as Head of the Dorm.&quot; Jessica said 
gratefully, &quot;I will do my best as always.&quot; 

Sophia smiled down at the girl, &quot;I know you will. Try to let up on my 
niece a little while you are at it. She has gone through a lot over the 
last few years and tends to stray from time to time.&quot; 

Jessica flushed, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry... I....&quot; 

Sophia placed a hand upon the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I know.&quot; She said with a 
wink then turned to Kim and Penny, &quot;Now Kima... uhhh... Kim... are you 
sure you want to use that name?&quot; 

Kim nodded, &quot;I&#39;m not Kima anymore. I have always been Kim after all.&quot; 
She remarked confidently. 

&quot;You do realize that many of the girl&#39;s will find this confusing and 
some many refuse your request.&quot; Sophia reminded the girl. 

Kim nodded again, &quot;I know it will be difficult, but I want people to 
treat me like my other self and if they keep calling me Kima they will 
never see me as anything other then Kim&#39;s double.&quot; 

&quot;Alright.&quot; Sophia stated, satisfied with the answer, &quot;And you both are 
you sure you want to share a room together?&quot; She inquired for the fourth 
time.

Penny nodded vigorously, &quot;I&#39;m afraid to sleep alone and Kim makes me 
rest easier.&quot; 

Jessica glared at Kim, &quot;She does, does she?&quot; She inquired suspiciously. 

Kim let out a nervous laugh and hide behind Penny, &quot;Come on Penny. Let&#39;s 
use the shower before the place fills with girls.&quot; She suggested 
nervously. 

&quot;The private rooms have their own washroom.&quot; Sophia informed the girl, 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to worry about fighting with the other girl&#39;s over the 
washroom any longer.&quot;  

&quot;Really?&quot; Kim beamed at the idea of her own washroom and grabbed Penny&#39;s 
hand, &quot;Come on. I have to check this out.&quot; She stated as she pulled the 
girl across the lobby. 

Jessica started after the girls, &quot;Hey! No funny business.&quot; She called 
out. 

Penny spun around and stuck out her tongue at her sister then rushed up 
the stairs after Kim. 

Jessica shook her head and was about to turn back to the office when she 
spotted Misty waiting near the sofas. Nervously she glanced to the 
ground, still not sure what to say to the girl. 

Sophia glanced down at her watch and tapped it, &quot;It is getting late. I 
should really check on Missy.&quot;

Jessica spun around to glance up at the Head Mistress in surprise, &quot;Head 
Mistress Melissa is not leaving us?&quot; 

Sophia shook her head, &quot;No, she just needed a moments rest. She has been 
working too hard recently so do not expect to see her around much in the 
next little while.&quot; She explained as she moved across the lobby, &quot;I&#39;ll 
check in on you all in a few hours.&quot; She stated with a smile, &quot;Have a 
good evening girls.&quot; She waved to the group of girls as she pushed 
through the front doors and disappeared down the path to her home.  

Jessica glanced at Misty again and restlessly approached the girl, 
&quot;Misty...&quot; She glanced at Emily and then back again, &quot;Listen, we need to 
talk.&quot; She gestured to the office. 

Hesitantly Misty moved across the lobby to the office where Jessica 
followed and closed the door behind her. For a moment they stood in 
silence, Misty with her back to Jessica as she scanned the many articles 
that had been pinned to the wall and Jessica leaning with her arms 
folded on the back of a swivel chair.  

Misty finally broke the stillness, wanting to get the pain over with 
quickly, &quot;You are in love with Kris, right?&quot; She remarked sadly. 

Jessica nodded timidly.

Misty stifled back a sob and swallowed hard, &quot;I... I see... S... so... 
is this good bye then?&quot; 

Jessica moved to stand behind Misty and wrapped her arms around the 
girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I told you before that I could never love anyone.&quot; 

Misty sniffled, &quot;I was fine with you not loving anyone, but now there is 
someone and it hurts. I wanted to be the one to unlock your heart.&quot; 

Jessica set her head upon Misty&#39;s shoulder, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry. I never 
meant to hurt you.&quot; 

Misty turned around in the girl&#39;s arms and smiled, &quot;I am glad that I 
could be here for you now.&quot; She stated sincerely, &quot;And... I will always 
be here for you.&quot; She placed a light kiss upon Jessica&#39;s forehead. A 
tear escaped the corner of her eye and she quickly wiped it away, &quot;I&#39;m 
glad to hear you got your job back. It wouldn&#39;t be the same without you 
as the Dorm Head.&quot; 

Jessica straightened up and took Misty&#39;s hand in her own, &quot;Thank you. 
For everything and mostly for understanding.&quot; She lightly kissed the 
back of Misty&#39;s hand and opened the office door, &quot;I have some things to 
do, Sophia wants a log of everything that happened today and I need to 
make sure our new dorm mates are alright.&quot; She started out the door and 
turned back to the girl once more, &quot;I&#39;m truly sorry...&quot; Abruptly she 
turned on her heels and ran up the stairs to check on Tanya and 
Cherilyn.

The moment Jessica disappeared from view, and she heard the sound of the 
stair door closing, Misty collapsed to one of the office chairs and 
buried her face in her hands. Emily slowly approached the office and 
gazed in upon her friend. Without a word Emily entered the room and 
placed a gentle hand upon her friend&#39;s back and lightly stroked it. 
Misty abruptly turned in the chair and wrapped her arms around Emily&#39;s 
waist, burying her face in the girl&#39;s stomach and let out a weak sob.
