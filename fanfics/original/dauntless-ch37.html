<p>“Ballad of Angels:  her bloody trail”</p>
<p>Athena Sifr had  been thrust into the wilderness by herself, forced to rely solely on  her senses and her strength to survive. This was hardly an alien  concept for her, since that was how she had lived for nearly half her  life. Meeting Fuuka had softened her edge and quieted her lust for  battle, but it had also opened up a whole world of experiences she  never would’ve felt. Her bond with the gentle Kitsune was so  strong that in her heart, Athena knew that her lover was safe, and  would not allow herself to worry about her, regardless of their  distance. With Fuuka gone, of course, that meant she would have to  reawaken her old skills; she would cease to become the quiet guardian  and would transform into the warrior she had once been.</p>
<p>Thinking  about this  drew memories from Athena’s past. The world was vast, untamed, and  empty; she had plenty of time to reminisce as she hopped over the  desolation in search of shelter and food. Her trusty sword Morisato  had stayed by her side during the unexpected transfer, but she kept  it sheathed and slung around her back so she could run on all fours.  All Usagin are exceptional sprinters, but Athena’s skills surpassed  even theirs; she had abilities that no natural being possessed. Her  memories concerning the origin of these phenomenal powers were foggy  and vague, but she wanted to keep whatever she knew fresh in her  mind: she did not want to forget.</p>
<p>It was years  ago—nearly three decades, to be precise—and worlds away,  literally another time and place, now all but concealed by those in  power. Athena’s first parental figure was a nameless instructor  who taught her how to read, write, and perform rudimentary exercises.  She recalled anonymous mentors guiding her through mathematics,  sciences, and history; there were men who taught her how to fire a  gun, women who taught her espionage, and students as well, learning  alongside her—rivals, she believed. She couldn’t remember if any  of the other students had been her friend; all she knew was that she  was later pitted against them in mock-battles. It was so long ago.</p>
<p>Athena broke her  thoughts as she came to a lake. An enormous serpent, its body like a  tree and its head as large as a boar’s, lied coiled next to the  water, so still that even Athena’s eyes had not spotted him. The  slick smell of its grassy scales was the only indication that  something was amiss—no doubt her invisible friend thought she was  his prey. Athena perked her long ears up and drew her sword, keeping  it in one hand as she gradually knelt down for a drink. The beast  remained sublimely motionless, not even flicking its tongue or  blinking its large yellow eyes. Athena drew two sips and savored  them carefully, then slowly backed away from the pond, studying the  area the scent was coming from. The serpent’s camouflage was so  perfect that she didn’t even notice it uncoiling and slithering her  way; it looked like a breeze playing with the grass.</p>
<p>“Don’t  do it,”  she warned, holding her sword so that it reflected the sunlight. “Go  find someone else. If you challenge me, you’ll die. I’ve faced  stronger opponents than you, and I’ve killed every one of them.” That  statement certainly brought out images of darker times, but now  was not the time to be melancholy. The serpent crawled closer, its  body wriggling perfectly with the grass, pausing just two meters away  from its prey, ready to jump. Athena arched her weapon back, raising  her guard as she waited for her enemy’s attack. She was nobody’s  prey.</p>
<p>The serpent lashed  like a whip, cracking the air as it snapped its jaws. Athena swung.</p>
<p>The head tumbled to  the ground, its body flailing. Athena flicked the blood from her  weapon. Breakfast was served.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>She  remembered  mastering at least fifteen weapons before she reached puberty, and  she definitely remembered making her first kill, when that bully  pushed her too far. The attempt was clumsy and panicked, but it was  also empowering, and it gave her a thrill that would be unmatched for  years. Her instructors praised her, saying she did good, that he got  what was coming to him, and that’s the way she should do things. The  other students gave Athena a wider berth after that day. She  vowed that her next kill would be cleaner.</p>
<p>Broad gaps filled  in most of her history. She only recalled a handful of names, and  fuzzy faces to match them. She remembered the fistfight she got  into, and how badly she was bruised. The other girl wasn’t so  fortunate, and had to be taken into operation, which she never came  out of. There were no holidays, no birthdays, no parents, and no  signs of affection: Athena couldn’t recall anybody hugging or  kissing her before she met Fuuka. Oh sure, her instructors patted  her, stroked her hair, gave her rewards, and sang of her deeds, but  they were still emotionally abusive. That was one of the few  certainties in her past: nobody had ever valued her life.</p>
<p>Sharing  a kinship  with the renowned Usagin hunters gave Athena an edge when it came to  survival in nature. Several of her classmates had been killed during  these exercises, succumbing to exposure, starvation, wild animals,  even severe depression. Images of camping, wandering, and hunting  were obviously prevalent as Athena made her way through the alien  world. She came across a ravine and pushed a tree over, creating a  makeshift bridge. She cleaned and prepared the serpent using only  her sword and her paws; fires were started and extinguished with  ease; and she constructed shelters as if it were a part of her DNA.  Athena was slowly growing to enjoy her solitude, and it was fun being  challenged again—life with Fuuka had been too peaceful and easy. There  was no way Athena would ever trade her new life, of course; it  was just a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>Missions—there  were missions they sent her and the surviving students on. Some of  them involved acting as bodyguards, assassins, or members of a  sweeper team. She clearly recalled being asked to bomb the office of  a radical lawyer, and didn’t she have to master a sniper rifle in  three days so she could kill that corrupt police chief? Yes, that’s  right, and sometimes she had allies. The students she fought against  one day were coworkers the next. They were expected to fight when  ordered to fight, cooperate when ordered to cooperate, eat and sleep  when ordered to…but who was controlling them? Athena couldn’t  think of them at first. It was most likely a private organization,  sequestered on an isolated planet, away from the scrutiny of  authorities, endowed with an impressive fortune—what else could  explain those facilities, the intense research, the operations, the  drugs, the endless tests and weapons, the indifferent way her mentors  reacted to another death…</p>
<p>“Number C-49-J is  down. Transfer him to operations and extract what you can. Continue  with your objective, please.”</p>
<p>“We’ve lost  eight today. They seem to be reacting better to the treatment. I  wonder how many we’ll lose during the next trial. At this rate…”</p>
<p>“Subject is  epileptic. Go ahead and put them down; there’s nothing more we can  do. Bring in the next one, please.”</p>
<p>“Well done,  number D-89-F. Keep up the good work. You may even earn a name if  you continue to improve.”</p>
<p>“Yes sir,” she  replied quietly. “I will do my best.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>They had ultimately  settled on naming her Athena, after one of the Gaian goddesses of  wisdom; one of her mentors also tagged “Sifr” onto her, drawing  on his mother’s maiden name for inspiration. Out of the  hundreds—the <em>thousands</em> that Athena had interacted with on  that primitive, hellish world, only the elect were given names. These  special few had to be handpicked by a panel of distinguished  observers, eight men and women who oversaw and funded the project  (whatever it was). Athena couldn’t remember the exact number of  students who received names—somewhere around fifty, she  believed—but she did recall being the only one unanimously voted  for. That meant that even among the elite, Athena had emerged as an  exceptional student and warrior, which, needless to say, created  quite a few enemies.</p>
<p>She had to kill  three of them before people started to leave her alone again.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>After eating and  drinking her fill, Athena left the serpent and the pond behind, and  resumed her search for Fuuka. Initially, the iron-willed doctor and  her immediate family were the only people Athena trusted and opened  up to, and when she first signed on for this indefinite voyage, she  kept this habit. Only recently did she start to warm up to others,  as they continued to prove their trustworthiness and their valor, but  she figured the majority of the crew still saw her as a cold, aloof,  quiet warrior, which was perfectly all right with her. Athena didn’t  want friends who didn’t trust her completely, nor did she want to  be around those <em>she</em> could not rely on. Amy Miracle was  definitely one of the exceptions; Athena also liked Herut for her  no-nonsense maturity, Shana for her sickly-sweet charm, Alala for her  inner strength, Mink for her calm, rational behavior, and Kate for  her sincerity.</p>
<p>She came upon a  surprising site as she followed the grass and the clouds and the  stampeding herds, something so extraordinary and alien to this  primordial civilization that she halted in her tracks, opened her  mouth, and shivered. It cast a great shadow as it defiantly pierced  the sky, two spires protruding out of a box-shaped construction, very  nearly resembling a devil. The building, probably an ancient  sanctuary or shrine, was a rusty green color, thickly-coated by  mosses and vines, its outer walls crumbling. There were bird’s and  wasp’s nests on the higher levels, and several insects crawled on  the broken tiles inside. As Athena inched closer, her sword drawn  and senses on full alert, she spied wedge-shaped runes carved into  the rock, created in an era before history began, symbols to alert  visitors of some long-forgotten ritual. A single brick from this  mysterious monument went up to Athena’s knee; the tips of the  spires stretched above all but the tallest trees. Her spine  trembled, and she decided to escape, leaving the sanctuary in peace.</p>
<p>Athena’s  memories  of her previous life improved the closer they came to its conclusion.  She recalled with near-perfect clarity the events that led her away  from that maelstrom onto calmer shores. The organization that bred,  kept, and trained Athena and her few remaining contemporaries had  been running them through a standard test, when a revolt broke out  and the test subjects made their getaway. This was no spontaneous  rebellion: it had been carefully crafted over two years by a dozen  or so survivors who were bitterly disillusioned and desperate for  freedom. They, along with a large group of sympathizers and  rabble-rousers, orchestrated a great confusion during the training  exercise, bringing fresh destruction to a world that was controlled  by chaos.</p>
<p>As misanthropic as  Athena was, she nevertheless put her lot in with the rebels, and  finally managed to exact some revenge against her captors and  teachers, using the very same killing methods they had been hammering  into her brain since birth. Several of her comrades fell; she  believed a fourth </p>
<p>of them perished in  that initial pandemonium, while another half were killed during the  actual escape. Athena never learned how many survived, but she  didn’t think it was very many. She herself only made it out by the  skin of her teeth, and only because Fuuka had found her so quickly.</p>
<p>“Fuu-chan…” Merely whispering her name raised Athena’s spirits. She never  would’ve believed that such a frail, quiet, sweet woman could also  be so incredibly strong. Fuuka had bravely taken a complete stranger  into her house—an enemy of the Kitsunes and a dangerous killer, no  less—nursed her wounds, and opened her heart with love and  patience. She chose to remain by Athena’s side even when she  learned about her friend’s sordid past (or what little Athena could  dredge up), and the terrifying powers she had—yes, they stayed  together even when Fuuka was diagnosed with a debilitating illness  that would one day cause her to rot away. That last blow was the  wickedest one of all to Athena—how could someone as wonderful as  Fuuka die so miserably?—and yet her darling Fuu-chan continued to  smile, heal others, and enjoy life. Just thinking about her brought  a tear to Athena’s eye, and she wiped it away gently. She had  never cried before meeting Fuuka; it was a very disturbing, yet  wonderfully relieving sensation.</p>
<p>As far as Athena  knew, she was the only one that had made it past the spaceport. Being the only one of its kind in the whole world, it was very  heavily protected, but the rebels had planned for this, even though  few if any were alive to challenge it. The remnants split up and  went on a frenzy, utilizing all their abilities and all the training  for this, their very last trial. The odds of survival were minimal;  the slaughter was gorgeously violent. Athena easily recalled the  bloody trail she left in her wake, how so many bodies were piled, how  frightened those people looked, and how cold she reacted as her  comrades were picked off. She alone made it into a ship, and thanks  to her drills as a pilot, she was able to break away from that  nameless world and achieve freedom at long last.</p>
<p>But of course,  nothing really goes according to plan. She barely made it to another  system before her ship was attacked, and brave as she was, Athena was  outnumbered. She managed to destroy a fair number of her pursuers  before she was forced to make an emergency landing. The crash  wounded her brutally, but thankfully, she had just enough strength  and ammunition left to finish off the last of her foes. She couldn’t  remember passing out, so Athena took her lover’s word for it, and  relied on the Fujiwara clan to fill in the rest. After all, her life  didn’t really begin until she woke up in their care, protected by  an angel whom she would one day devote her life to.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“What do you  think you’re doing?!” Athena turned around casually to face her  friend, who had a frightened and surprised expression. Nothing  seemed out of the ordinary, though, so she was a little vexed.</p>
<p>“I’m going out  to hunt, of course. You said that supplies were low and times were  hard. Don’t worry, Fuu-chan, I can take care of myself.”</p>
<p>“That’s  not  what I meant!” she exclaimed, marching over to the imposing Usagin. She  yanked the guns out of Athena’s hands, threw them in a trash  can, and dusted her paws off. “What were you thinking, Athena? Don’t  you know how terrible guns are? You do realize they kill  more people than they save! And besides, they’re loud and vulgar,  and they stink, and bullet wounds are difficult to operate on.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she  sighed, “then I guess everyone will starve.” Fuuka took a  relaxing breath and put her arms around her friend, expressing love  even as her patience was tested.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Listen, I’m  not saying that you shouldn’t go out hunting. We are desperate,  and I really appreciate this. Just don’t use a gun, okay? Not  ever. Can you promise me you won’t?”</p>
<p>“If it’s that  important to you, then yes: I’ll never use a gun again. What  would you suggest instead?”</p>
<p>“How about a bow,  or a knife?” she offered. “Oh, wait, I’ve got an even better  idea! Hold on!” Fuuka scampered away, and returned about two  minutes later carrying a sheathed sword, tied to a strap. She  grinned beautifully, bowed, and handed it to Athena, who drew it out  slowly. The luster was flawless; it was like looking into a mirror,  and the edge was amazingly sharp. The blade’s surface was  unmarred, but the hilt had the Fujiwara seal on it.</p>
<p>“Magnificent,”  Athena smiled. “Did your grandfather make this?”</p>
<p>“No, actually, it  was passed down our family line. I think it was made before my clan  became doctors. Uh, let me think… Yeah, we used to be  sword-smiths a long time ago, when there were warring tribes and  feuds, but we later became doctors. This sword is the last of its  kind, and it’s been our birthright ever since. I figured that  since it belongs to me, I can give it to whomever I choose…” Athena shivered, not knowing whether to refuse or accept it. Fuuka  pushed it into her arms before she could decide, smiling cutely and  even leaning up to kiss her nose.</p>
<p>“You are  certain?”</p>
<p>“Positive. I  mean, you’re like a member of the family now, so technically, it’s  yours as well. I even gave it a name!”</p>
<p>“Probably  something from those anime shows you watch,” Athena snorted. Fuuka  giggled.</p>
<p>“Am I that  transparent? I actually named it after the male hero of my favorite  anime, <em>Ah My Goddess</em>.”</p>
<p>“You mean Keiichi  Morisato? That’s what I’d call ironic, naming a sword after a  spineless wimp. But…it’s fitting, in a way. I approve.”</p>
<p>Athena pulled her  sword out again, just to look at it and smile. Her life had been so  blessed since she met Fuuka; she couldn’t imagine a time or a place  outside of her world. Athena knew that part of the reason why her  past was so obscured was due to the enhancements she was given, along  with her brain’s own defense mechanisms—but the biggest  contributor was Fuuka herself, whose bright smile, shining eyes, and  beautiful soul helped wash the blood away and made Athena forget all  but the most important memories. She vowed to one day repay this  kindness, however she could, even if she had to give up her own life. Fuuka was so pure; she deserved to live.</p>
<p>But until that  time, Athena’s journey through isolation would continue. She would  prove herself worthy of reuniting with her soulmate. That meant  picking herself up and moving along, over hot stones and slick  grasses, past graveyards filled with haunting bones, through a river  and over a—</p>
<p>Suddenly, it came to  her, like a bolt out of the blue. She finally remembered.</p>
<p>The organization  that had been sponsoring the project to create a breed of super  soldiers was the United Cosmic Military.</p>
<p>And leading the  project was a man named Franklin Baker Hill—Rebecca’s father.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p></p>
<p>Athena: Um…I’m  not comfortable doing this myself. I think the next chapter will  show other members of our crew who are separated and lost. It will  probably chronicle their experiences, conflicts, and bonds. I don’t  know much else. They can give a better preview than me. Anyway,  please read the next chapter, “Hearts and Stars: a moment of  tranquility”. Thanks.</p>
