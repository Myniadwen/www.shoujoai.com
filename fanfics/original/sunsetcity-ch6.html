~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Rainthorn Building (Ground Floor), North-Central District

Ryo was gone. That lift would take him up to the office of Cyria Mau 
herself. Which was good. He needed to focus on her. While Kayde would 
take care of the revenge for Yun-Yun. Though he wasn&#39;t the most friendly 
or magnetic of men out there, Kayde cared deeply for those he could call 
his friends. Yun-Yun was one of those people. She had stuck beside him 
for as long as he had known her. Even when Ryo left Sunset City and 
their group was broken, Yun-Yun always made sure to have room in her 
life for Kayde and whatever problems he had. It was time that he repaid 
Yun-Yun for all that she had done for him. 

The American teen faced off with the other American, Rockeye. His toothy 
grin was more than apparent. He was more than pleased with himself for 
what he had done to Yun-Yun. He was clearly on Cyria&#39;s payroll. That was 
more than obvious now. There was no other way he could have gotten into 
this building without Kayde and Ryo noticing some smash and trash 
damage. This was all a plan. Rockeye had probably been the one to tell 
Cyria about Ryo in the fist place. Thinking about all of this made Kayde 
even more anxious to see justice done. 

Rockeye sneered at the blonde boy. &quot;So. You must be Lewis Charlie Kayde, 
am I right?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; That had Kayde stumped, &quot;How do you know my name?&quot;

&quot;Cyria knows about all of you. She crushed all of the gangs in Sunset 
City aside from the Zazubaza Gang. Just so that she&#39;d know what was 
going on in the streets. As long as we told her everything. But 
mostly... she wanted to know about all those connected to the Asagawa 
Family. So we made a point of harassing the Brookwood District more than 
others. It was the neighbourhood you and your friends lived at, wasn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Kayde scowled at him. &quot;So that&#39;s it. The reason you kept attacking the 
Diamond Star. You knew that its owner, Jahn, was a friend of Ryo&#39;s in 
the old days. Just like Yun-Yun and I were. You people have been keeping 
tabs on us until the day that Ryo finally returned to Sunset City.&quot;

&quot;Got it in one,&quot; Rockeye replied, &quot;Cyria needed us to provide her with 
all the info on the streets and to keep you people under watch.&quot;

Kayde tightened his fists. &quot;...You lapdog. Why does she even care about 
Ryo? What makes him so special to her?&quot;

&quot;How the hell should I know? I don&#39;t ask questions or bitch about the 
reasons. She&#39;s paying me and my gang BIG BUCKS for doing what we did. 
That&#39;s all I need to know.&quot;

Money. In the end that was all that people like Rockeye cared about. 
Money. Even if that meant harming people that didn&#39;t even play into the 
game. Like Yun-Yun. Kayde grit his teeth hard and undid the top button 
of his brown leather jacket. Then seconds later he assumed a fighting 
stance and faced off with the towering Rockeye. It was time to make him 
suffer for what he did to Yun-Yun.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuki-oh Apartment Building, Nippon Town District

Black Widow scowled as she stared at her own face in the mirror. This 
was the bathroom of her apartment in the Nippon Town District. Clad only 
in her thick black bra and shorts. She had come home earlier on after 
suffering defeat at the hands of Ryo Asagawa. Widow gripped her hands 
into fists and growled under her breath. She could never have guessed 
that someone so young could have been so skilled. And how much of a 
chance did she have against him in the first place? Everything was going 
so well for him up until that point. She felt like she was winning. But 
then it all went pear-shaped. The whole fight just descended out of her 
control in the blink of an eye. And she could still hear his arrogant 
voice in her head.  

&quot;You&#39;re pretty good...&quot;

&quot;And I can see that you really want to kill me here.&quot;

&quot;Because I can tell that you&#39;re just a lackey for a higher power.&quot;

&quot;...Oh, it&#39;s a boast alright...&quot; 

&quot;...But it&#39;s not false...&quot;

Black Widow let off another menacing growl and punched the mirror 
overhanging her sink. She smashed it into shard in one blow. Leaving 
behind a fragmented reflection of herself. There was a rage burning 
inside this woman. To be bested by a mere child... it was more than the 
Black Widow could take. But there was nothing she could do about it now. 
The woman sighed and turned on one of the taps. She washed off a little 
of the blood that was leaking from the fist that punched the mirror. 
Once that was taken care off she walked out of her bathroom and into her 
living room. There was a stereo system on the floor at the far side of 
the room. She walked up to it, kneeled down, and turned the thing on. 
Soon a Gentatsu Boys song, in-elegantly titled Shadowfuck; played into 
the background. 

As the sound of profane lyrics, thrashing drums and searing guitar solos 
filled the silence of that apartment, Widow walked over to a dining 
table that was on the alternate side of the room. On it was a bottle of 
Whiskey and a small shot glass. Black Widow opened the bottle and poured 
some of the Whiskey into the shot glass. Then she put down the bottle 
and gulped down the drink. She was not looking forward to reporting the 
outcome of her fight tomorrow. This just made her feel a little bit more 
comfortable with the prospect. While she listened to the music in the 
milieu, there was a rattling noise just above her. This went unnoticed 
by the cold Black Widow. Until that rattling became completely 
unavoidable. It was a shaking in a grate forged into the ceiling for the 
air ducts. It came down loudly and clattered against the pine wood 
table. Black Widow looked straight back up at the now opened air duct 
with mistrusting eyes. A speedy flash shot down from it a second later. 
Something crashed into the wooden table of the living room. Black Widow 
dove out of the way by flipping backwards repeatedly. The image that had 
come down from the open air duct was clearly visible. A woman. A woman 
who was dressed in pure white and had her leg lodged into the gap 
between the two halves of the broken table. The woman stood upwards and 
frowned at Black Widow with both pity and anger. 

That woman was White Rose. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Camilla.&quot; 

&quot;...Elizabeth?&quot; Widow&#39;s eyes narrowed, &quot;...So. Father has trained his 
little niece to take me down. I can tell from the blood over your face 
that&#39;s what you&#39;re here for. To kill me. Am I correct?&quot; 

White Rose nodded. &quot;Yes. You betrayed our Family. And you forfeited your 
right to succeed it as the true leader. Now that mission has been passed 
on to me. And I will make you die for opposing our order.&quot;

&quot;Heh!&quot; The Widow scoffed at the Rose, &quot;Do you really believe that you 
have what it takes to stop me? Child, you have underestimated my will to 
both live and take life. Assassination isn&#39;t a kid&#39;s game. By 
challenging me you are assuring yourself of an early grave.&quot;

White Rose assumed a fighting stance. &quot;...I might be young. But never 
mistake youth for weakness. No matter what you say... this will happen. 
You will die. And I shall restore the honour of the Argand Family once 
and for all!&quot;

White Rose then acted on her anger. She leapt from the smashed-up dining 
table and vaulted across the room towards Black Widow. Widow again 
scoffed at this and leaned backwards. When the White Rose descended 
towards her with one leg outstretched to attack, Black Widow caught the 
kick between her palms right in the middle of the momentum. She tossed 
the younger girl overhead. White Rose was flung towards the back wall 
with amazing skill. But not enough skill to subdue Rose&#39;s spirit. The 
young woman rotated in the air and kicked off the wall in recovery from 
the throw. She pounced back across the room with added speed and zoomed 
straight for Black Widow again. The older fighter turned around just a 
little too late to do anything about it. She both gasped and groaned 
when White Rose punched her across the jaw in attack. And while Widow 
kneeled down and held her already sore cheek, White Rose attractively 
flipped around and landed. 

&quot;So...&quot; Widow pulled a smile and looked back, &quot;...It seems the little 
bud that was Elizabeth Argand... has finally blossomed into a Rose...&quot;

White Rose remained focused. &quot;I will show you no quarter, Camilla.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting as much,&quot; Black Widow then stood back up, &quot;And I 
don&#39;t need it either! It&#39;s time to school you in on what a REAL assassin 
can do, Child!&quot; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Rainthorn Building (Top Floor), North-Central District

When the doors to the lift began to open again at the top floor, the 
25th floor, Ryo strode out of them and walked down that long stretch of 
a hallway to Cyria&#39;s office. He had no idea how he was going to handle 
this. This woman Cyria was after him for some reason that was unclear. 
But for the most part, he could not let it slide. She had bought danger 
to Yun-Yun, who was more or less uninvolved. She had allowed that 
animal, Rockeye, to wreck the Mao-Kung Dojo. It would take weeks, maybe 
months for Yun-Yun and Shun Son Lee to start training students again. 
That was their livelihood in the long run. Cyria had put that in 
jeopardy. She had to pay for it. Ryo paced down the hall until he was 
staring at that door again. After taking one firm breath... he violently 
kicked that door open. It was busted off its hinges with one strike. And 
it toppled backwards into the office of the mastermind behind the 
revival of Sunset City. And Yun-Yun&#39;s current state of health. The very 
woman herself sat at her desk as usual. With that same devious smile as 
before. 

Cyria was here after all. &quot;...Welcome. Ryo Asagawa.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot; Ryo shook his fist at her, &quot;...I don&#39;t know what your game is, 
but it ends here! What do you want of me!? And what the hell do you mean 
by ordering your pet dog to attack the Mao-Kung Dojo!?&quot;

&quot;...Feeling frustrated?&quot; She asked simply. 

Ryo was quite confused by that remark. &quot;...W-What...?&quot;

&quot;...Little boy,&quot; Cyria stood up from her desk, &quot;I paid Cain and the 
Zazubaza Gang to keep an eye on your friends. I knew that if you came 
back to Sunset City... they would be the first you would contact. And I 
was right. Then it was just a matter of bringing you here to me. Not as 
an inquisitive boy. But as someone ready to fight.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; Bellowed Ryo. 

Cyria then walked away from the desk, replying; &quot;I knew your Father. I 
have been living in this City for over twenty years. I was master to the 
great power of Evil Soul. The legendary fighting style based upon the 
tenets of union between the Body and the Soul. I was ready to take my 
fated place as a Grand Master. To take my place in destiny. But just as 
the taste of power was on my lips... it was taken from me by your 
father!&quot;

Ryo blinked. &quot;...My... Dad...?&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; She answered, &quot;I had a record of ninety-nine battles and zero 
defeats. The hundredth battle of my career was for more than just 
honour. But my triumph was taken when I fought your father in that 
battle. He was legendary. Said to be one of the strongest fighters alive 
at that time. I thought that by defeating Tsukasa... I would gain the 
kind of glory that I had yearned for my whole life... but I was 
defeated. Tsukasa broke my record... and my spirit. In one loss my world 
was shattered. I had to seek out my vengeance. But by then it was too 
late...&quot;

&quot;...Too late...&quot; Ryo then realized, &quot;...My Dad was killed before you 
could fight him again. You... know something, don&#39;t you? Do you know who 
killed my Dad?!&quot;

Cyria&#39;s face darkened. &quot;...Of course I do...&quot;

&quot;Then you better tell me!&quot; Shouted the Japanese boy.

&quot;...Not so fast,&quot; Cyria answered back, &quot;I lured you here for one reason 
and one reason only. To redeem myself... I must defeat Tsukasa. And 
since he is dead now... the only one left who can fill his shoes... is 
you. To avenge myself... you must be conquered.&quot;

Ryo scowled at this. &quot;...You mean this whole thing is about a stupid 
grudge?! Do you realize how inane this all is? Attacking and monitoring 
innocent people just so you can arrange a fight to make yourself feel 
better about a trouncing that you suffered three years ago?!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be absurd,&quot; Cyria shot back, &quot;The KAIGA Group has deeper reasons 
for wanting you, boy. You are a Child of Gaia. Just like your sister. My 
official orders were to bring you to us. But I care not for what those 
pencil-pushing money-grabbers want. All I want is to make you suffer for 
what your father did to me!&quot;

That was something Ryo wasn&#39;t going to turn down. The young adopted a 
fighting stance and breathed with eagerness. &quot;Well... you&#39;ve certainly 
earned a fight now. I couldn&#39;t give a damn about what issues you have 
with losing. Or what resentments you have against my Dad. But your 
actions hurt Yun-Yun. And if you know who killed my father, too... then 
you better believe I&#39;m gonna beat that identity outta you!&quot;

At that, Cyria smiled. &quot;...Perfect...&quot;

Of course... Ryo was unaware of just what it was that he was getting 
himself into. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Rainthorn Building (Ground Floor), North-Central District

&quot;Orraaaagggghhh!&quot;

The battle between Rockeye and Kayde hadn&#39;t lasted long but the damage 
to the first floor caused by it was apparent. Three of the thick glass 
panes in front of the doors to the Rainthorn Building were smashed. The 
front desk where the secretary usually sat was now trashed like the 
windows. There were dents in the walls as deep as a man&#39;s back. And 
there was still more to come. Rockeye thrust his meaty arm at Kayde. The 
younger fighter shifted around the strike and came straight back with 
three solid punches to the stomach. The bigger man gasped and coughed 
from the shock of being hit so fast. And it was slowing him down. 
Rockeye&#39;s clothing was already torn and his face was bleeding profusely. 
But there wasn&#39;t a scratch on Kayde. 

The smaller American assumed another fighting stance. His blonde hair 
whipped around his shoulders whilst doing so. His whole body came down 
with him as he crouched before the dazed Rockeye. He focused his 
energies into the lower half of his body. Waiting for that right moment. 
As soon as Rockeye began to regain his bearings, Kayde launched his 
attack. His whole body flipped back upwards and backwards in a powerful 
arc motion. His body cycled around like a flash and both of his feet 
pelted the hulking Rockeye across the face. The larger man was batted 
off his own feet and then thrown backwards. His heavy body crashed into 
a set of steel and plastic chairs that had been made for visitors to the 
building. It all collapsed around him with an echoing bang. Kayde landed 
on his feet swiftly. He stood up again and looked down at his opponent, 
moving his brown leather trench coat out of the way.

After a moment of stillness Rockeye began to move again. His groans soon 
followed that action. And his trembling muscles tried to amble his torso 
into a standing position. He eventually got back up onto his feet. It 
was a slow process but he did it. With his breath now heavy and his eyes 
drooping, the towering man-mountain looked over at the boy who had done 
this to him. 

&quot;Damn you...!&quot; Rockeye shouted, &quot;Damn you to hell!&quot;

Kayde pulled a smile. &quot;You&#39;re angry? Why is that? In spite of 
everything... you had no problems in beating the hell out of Yun-Yun and 
destroying her source of income. And you have the nerve to get angry 
when you face someone who can actually hang ten with you? You&#39;re not 
only scum; you&#39;re pathetic.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see about that!&quot; Rockeye yelled, right before charging over at 
Kayde again. The blonde youth stood still and waited from that attack to 
come. Rockeye stuck out his arm to knock down Kayde in a sort of lariat 
attack. Kayde smiled again and ducked under the attack. Once the 
pressure was over, the young martial artist kicked the bigger fighter in 
the side. Rockeye groaned at the rib-shot and stumbled forwards. 

Kayde cracked his knuckles with intimidating zeal. He suddenly looked 
far bigger than Rockeye was. &quot;...I won&#39;t let you get away until I make 
you feel the weight of what you did to Yun-Yun... and if you&#39;re lucky... 
I might even let you live...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuki-oh Apartment Building, Nippon Town District

If you listened closely to the walls of that particular apartment in the 
Setsuki-oh Building, beyond the stereo system bellowing out Gentatsu 
Boys songs by the bucket load, you would have heard the feminine screams 
of attack and pain of Black Widow and White Rose. The two assassins of 
the Argand Family, locked in combat. White Rose dashed over the living 
room and pulled back her fist to strike. Black Widow watched all of her 
movements and saw the stride (and what would follow it) coming. When the 
younger woman attempted to punch her, Widow danced around the fist and 
turned around at the same time. She then clapped her hand down upon 
Rose&#39;s neck in a sharp chopping motion. White Rose cried out and 
stumbled forwards over the carpet. And now that she was distracted, 
Widow had a full opening. Rose gripped the back of her neck to soften 
the pain. But while she did this; Black Widow roped her arms around the 
younger woman&#39;s waist in a tight grip from behind. White Rose&#39;s eyes 
flashed with alarm but she could not break free from Widow&#39;s grip. It 
was far too strong. 

&quot;Argand Family Special Technique No. 2!&quot; Widow yelled out, &quot;Argus 
Backbreaker!&quot;

And there was nothing that Rose could do to stop it. A feminine war cry 
came out of that throaty mouth of the Black Widow when she began tilting 
her body backwards and hoisted White Rose off the ground. Widow 
performed a full bridge-like motion that rammed Rose&#39;s head into the 
carpeted ground. It wasn&#39;t a rough floor but a collision at that speed 
could cause a concussion to any normal fighter. But Widow did not 
release the grip she had around the waist of the White Rose. She instead 
rolled over on her two legs, positioning the stunned Rose below her. 
Widow gave off another of those war cries of her and screamed,

&quot;Argand Family Special Technique No. 3! Double Argus Backbreaker!&quot;

And just like the attack stated, Rose was lifted up off her feet and her 
head slammed into the ground again with another vicious backbreaker. 
Widow finally released Rose from her hold and the younger woman rolled 
away, clutching her head. But that was not the end of it. Black Widow 
crouched to the ground for a second then jumped into the air with great 
force. She looked downwards at the laid-out White Rose and descended 
again directly at the younger Argand. White Rose looked up in the 
seconds before Widow came down violently upon her. She kicked up both of 
her legs and pushed up against Widow&#39;s stomach, plucking her out of the 
air. The older Swiss woman was robbed of her breath. Rose growled 
femininely and pushed Widow off her feet and legs. She was tossed away 
and thrown straight over the cream-coloured couch to Rose&#39;s right. The 
lover of Maya pressed her palms into the cream carpet and kicked her 
body up into a standing position. She ran over at the couch to see what 
had happened to Black Widow. But that timed assassin leapt from the back 
of the couch into the air again. She forced out her leg and tried to 
kick down Rose from that position. The White Rose blocked the kick with 
both hands and skidded back from the force. Widow landed a second later 
and then shot out a punch. Rose stepped around it with willowy speed and 
rotated around the older woman. Now Widow had left herself open. The 
White Rose roped the back of her right hand around Widow&#39;s neck and 
brought up her left arm. Her right hand gripped her left arm, while her 
left hand latched onto the back of Widow&#39;s head. White Rose then hopped 
up and grasped around Widow&#39;s waist with both off her legs. The teen 
growled out the words,

&quot;Argand Family Special Technique No. 7! Poison Lotus Grip!&quot;

Widow was feeling the strength of it. 

Her legs began to weaken and her air grew thin as White Rose held her in 
a binding and suffocating technique. Her eyesight weakened along with 
her legs. And soon she began to tumble to that cream-carpet ground 
again. The two women fell to the floor but Rose did not relinquish the 
grip. She held on like symbiotic plant. The Poison Lotus Grip was 
secured. Black Widow grew blue in the face from the strength of the hold 
and the amount of air she was losing because of it. But she was not 
going to throw in the towel now. The Widow of assassination struggled 
her hardest. But with both her own weight and that of Rose, she hauled 
herself off the ground. Like an inhuman monster she slowly carried 
herself over to a wall. With Rose still strapped to her back with a vice 
grip, she turned her back to the wall. Which put Rose&#39;s back to the 
wall. Then Widow rammed backwards. Rose grunted hard as she was knocked 
into the wall of the apartment. Then Widow did the same thing over and 
over and over. Again and again, each time a little weaker due to the 
loss of air. But when it seemed like Widow was just about to pass out, 
the final blow to the back was too much for Rose. She cried out and 
released her Poison Lotus Grip, uncurling both arms and legs. Widow ran 
forwards to just get away from Rose. And she sucked in air desperately 
to recover. White Rose had performed the Poison Lotus Grip flawlessly. 

White Rose stood up again, clutching at her back. Then threw caution to 
the wind and ran for Black Widow across that rock-music banging living 
room. Seeing that Rose was about to attack her again, Widow waited for 
her to expose herself for the launching of the strike. Rose pulled back 
one of her hands. A punch was coming. Widow ran towards Rose in the same 
way and gripped the girl by the collar of her top. She then rolled 
backwards and pulled White Rose with her. Then Widow kicked her legs 
into the firm stomach of the younger woman and tossed her overhead once 
more. Rose was sent flying into a second table, a coffee table. The 
sound of wood being broken by human mass thundered in that room. Widow 
kicked back up into a fighting stance. While an undaunted White Rose 
stood from the wreckage and splinters of the battered coffee table. 
Widow rushed ahead with another one of those blind charges. White Rose 
scowled at this, face now bleeding from being thrown into that mashed 
coffee table. Before Widow could even lay a hand on her, Rose batted her 
older cousin away with the back of her fist. Widow&#39;s face jerked. And 
White Rose followed up by kicking the woman dead centre in the stomach. 
Which had suffered after Widow&#39;s fight with Ryo Asagawa. She was 
propelled backwards by the force of the kick. And Rose advanced upon her 
with even more powerful combinations of punches, kicks and palm strikes. 
Each blow alternated between the head and the stomach. Head blows to 
keep Widow dazed, and stomach blows to exploit her current weakness. 
Widow could do nothing accept stagger backwards from the onslaught. One 
final blow across the face pushed the Black Widow from her feet. She 
fell to the floor and rolled backwards. Out of the doorway of the living 
room and into the bedroom. Widow soon after pulled her thoughts back 
into a coherent path and watched as White Rose came for her. As soon as 
the younger woman leered over her for another attack, Widow kicked out 
her leg into Rose&#39;s face. The younger woman was thumped back a little. 
Allowing Black Widow to slowly climb back onto her feet. 

Black Widow drew her hand back and attempted a punch. White Rose caught 
it with one of her hands. Then White Rose tried a punch with her other 
hand. Black Widow caught that punch with her free hand. The two women 
were now locked in hands and glaring at each other with twin looks of 
hatred, anger, and jealousy. But for all their hatred, they were evenly 
matched. The Argand Family had trained them both well. Now they were 
struggling to outdo each other as well as survive. Widow pushed more and 
more strength into this hand-to-hand stand off. And White Rose scoffed 
when she realized she was being pushed back. Her white leather boots 
didn&#39;t have enough traction to stop this. No matter how much she 
struggled. While a grin returned to the face of Widow, Rose hazarded a 
glance backwards. She was being push past the bed and towards the window 
of the bedroom. She had to do something.

Before she knew it, Rose&#39;s back was touching the cold glass of the 
window. And Black Widow loomed over her with the superior physical 
strength that came with added years. &quot;...You&#39;re finished, Elizabeth. 
Next time I visit the family home in Switzerland, I&#39;ll tell Daddy that 
you put up a good fight. Right before I kill him!&quot;

White Rose tightened her resolve. Though the Black Widow was stronger 
than her, Rose was far more agile. It was time to prove it. &quot;Not if I 
kill you first!&quot;

What happened next, happened with the rapidity of the wind. White Rose 
lessened the pressure on her hand-lock with Widow, tightened her body 
together and slid under the legs of the older woman. This action 
happened so quickly that it threw Black Widow for six. And left her 
unable to counter White Rose&#39;s following move. The young assassin gave 
one last kick into the back of Black Widow as she skidded across the 
carpet. And Widow screamed terrifyingly as she was kicked through the 
fragile glass of the window. The Setsuki-oh Apartment Building was a 
good seventy storeys high. Widow was kicked out into the cool night air 
with shards of broken glass and dots of her own blood surrounding her. 
And in the bedroom, Rose cast her eyes downwards whilst hearing Widow&#39;s 
plummeting scream into the city streets below.  

Rose caught her breath and resolved to get herself out of here before 
the police arrived to investigate. The saga of the Black Widow... was 
over. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Rainthorn Building (Top Floor), North-Central District

The battle between Cyria and Ryo was finally about to begin. The woman 
stood before the Japanese youth with another deceitful smile on her 
face. But her body slowly moved backwards, gliding along the ground like 
an ice skater. She closed her light blue eyes and a bright purple glow 
began to surround her whole body. It was vivid and sparkling in beauty. 
And it covered all of Cyria&#39;s torso until nothing could be seen of her. 
Then that glow dissipated. When Cyria was seen again, she was no longer 
dressed in that appropriate business suit. What was left behind was a 
completely new set of clothes that suited Cyria far better. A sleeveless 
red top, clinging red trousers and two links of chains, wrapped around 
her waist loosely. Over her shoulders was a flowing cape, red on the 
outside, black on the inside. The shoulder blade attached to the cape 
stuck out in horizontal directions. Her feet began to slowly rise off 
the floor in addition; until she was hovering about seven centimetres 
from the ground. Everyone once in a while, streaks of lightning energy 
passed up and down her body. Brightly. Sharply. But they did not shock 
Cyria. No. These were manifestations of her own power.  Ryo grit his 
teeth and held his ground. But deep in his stomach he could sense the 
power that this woman was wielding. She was no joke in the least. Her 
Chi was not quiet or restrained. It was violent and passionate; brutally 
destructive. Something Ryo would have never guessed a normal person 
could generate. But he had to defeat her. To make her pay for what she 
did to Yun-Yun and the Mao-Kung Dojo. And to find out who killed his 
Dad. 

Ryo growled with momentum then began charging. He pulled back his fist 
and ran straight into the firestorm of Cyria Mau. The older woman smiled 
as the teen advanced on her. Her blood red cape flocked behind her. And 
the new flow of her Chi into that particular area began to crack the 
back window of the office. Something that Ryo did not notice until he 
was within striking range of the Evil Soul. His whole body jerked 
forwards from one side when he drove his fist at her. When the punch 
came within three centimetres of her face she dodged it. Startling Ryo 
to no end. His dark eyes went wide when Cyria virtually glided to one 
side of his strike. He turned to face her again and attempted an 
overhead kick. Cyria&#39;s upper body curled under it with abnormal speed 
and skill, leaving Ryo vulnerable for approximately three seconds. She 
didn&#39;t capitalize on it. She let Ryo withdraw his leg and make a second 
effort with the other. It failed just as easily as the first. Cyria&#39;s 
hovering feet drifted over the carpet of that office room with great 
ease and allowed her to escape the blow. Ryo narrowed his eyes and 
turned his body again to meet with Cyria. He pulled back his hand and 
then tried his hardest to punch her. Before he even knew it, Cyria&#39;s 
eyes glinted with the preparation for a counter attack. His punch hit 
only air as the English woman zoomed around it. Then with almost 
frightening speed she jabbed her palm into his ribcage. Ryo tightened up 
with pain and yelled out as his whole body was batted away like a leaf 
in the wind. His torso was tossed high into the air of that room until 
he fell to the floor with a rough thump; face down. The young man 
groaned to himself and felt something wet and oozing under his shirt. 
Blood. The woman had only used one palm strike and she had already drawn 
blood. And the pain from it went without saying. He groaned irritably 
once more then rolled over onto his side. 

Cyria stood across from him. Eyes gleaming, arms crossed, smile nasty. 
Her cape circled around her even though there was no wind in that room. 
Another symbol of her relentless power. Ryo slowly climbed back onto his 
feet and studied this woman. She was stronger than he initially gave her 
credit for. But he couldn&#39;t stop now. He had come all this way to the 
Rainthorn Building. He had to see it through. Once he was on his feet 
again he ran over to Cyria Mau with his throat yelling out a fierce 
battle cry. He pounced at her again but Cyria did not move an inch. As 
soon as Ryo thrust out his leg to kick her like before, Cyria pushed her 
cape back and swerved around the blow with more of that lightning speed. 
One second she was standing in one place, and in the following second 
she was 90 degrees to the right. Ryo then grunted sharply with Cyria 
punching his back. He froze up the instant he felt her cold but savage 
power extend from her fist and into his body. The Japanese youngster was 
blown forwards and shoved into the frame of Cyria&#39;s desk. He collapsed 
against it and breathed in heavily. It was the strength of her Chi 
again. 

Cyria grinned to see Ryo strung out over her desk. Her body then 
summarily jumped into the air and ascended with inhuman power. The 
English woman bolted across the office and began shooting downward 
towards Ryo with both feet. Ryo released yet another scream when Cyria 
stomped into him with both feet. This action smashed the boy through the 
wooden desk of the office with a huge, resounding crash. Splinters, pens 
and work notes were tossed into the air with the damage. And seeing that 
damage done; Cyria backflipped off Ryo&#39;s back and landed a good five 
metres behind him. New blood dripped from Ryo&#39;s lips and face when he 
gradually began to rise up from the wreckage of the desk that his body 
had been driven into. 

Cyria sniggered at him. &quot;So THIS is what the son of Tsukasa Asagawa is 
capable of?&quot;

&quot;...B-Bitch...&quot; The younger fighter dragged himself out of the mangled 
shards of wood that was once Cyria Mau&#39;s desk and turned around to face 
Cyria, &quot;...I&#39;m going to stop you... and make you pay... for Yun-Yun.&quot;

She still just laughed at him. &quot;Aha, ha, ha, ha! Don&#39;t make me laugh, 
boy! Your Father was twice as powerful as this and it took all that he 
had to defeat me. You stand no chance. I thought that you would provide 
ripe sport for me. Enough to satiate my bruised honour. But I see now 
that you are just a weakling. No matter. I can at least please myself 
with beating the life out of Tsukasa&#39;s son.&quot;

&quot;...Just try it!&quot; Ryo shouted; right before he plunged himself straight 
into Cyria&#39;s proximity again. This time she wouldn&#39;t wait for him to 
attack her. The mistress of the Evil Soul power watched the boy with 
almost mechanical attention to detail. Then kicked him before he could 
even begin to defend himself. Ryo&#39;s mouth choked up both saliva and 
blood from the speed of ferocity of Cyria&#39;s kick. He was knocked out of 
his attacking posture and left unguarded in those brief few seconds. 
Brief few seconds that Cyria was more than happy to take advantage of. 
She called out a feminine battle cry of her own that made the window of 
the office crack even further. The woman smashed her fist into the core 
of Ryo&#39;s gut, making his whole body judder. She then ferociously punched 
him across the face with the free hand, which burst open his lower lip 
almost instantly. Fresh blood was knocked out of his mouth. Again when 
Cyria delivered a next brutal punch to the stomach. One that was so hard 
and so powerful that a wave of dust passed away from Ryo&#39;s feet. Caused 
only by the force of the strike. A final and tremendously savage kick 
across the face was enough to hurl Ryo backwards again. His image was 
pelted across the office room like a blur; until he slammed into the 
back wall. Another tired groan was released from him. And the older of 
the Asagawa siblings slid down to the floor, leaving behind a crater 
print in the white-painted wall. 

Cyria laughed demonically again from seeing the young man forced into 
submission. Her powers had grown since the battle with Tsukasa. By great 
lengths. Soon she would be even stronger than Reinhalt Schwarzluft 
himself. But while she simply gloated about her seemingly impending 
victory, Ryo opened one of his eyes to look at her. The other was 
half-open. And his vision was getting blurry. But he still was not about 
to throw in the towel. His father would never have given up. He knew 
that Yoko would never give up, that girl was always such a hardhead. So 
Ryo had no choice but to keep going. The young man pressed his palms 
into the wall and began to inch himself up. Cyria stopped laughing when 
she saw this, but still felt relaxed enough about to continue mocking 
him.

&quot;So you&#39;re up?&quot;

Ryo scoffed at her with a bloody, battered face. &quot;...And r-ready... to 
give you... the b-beatdown... of your life...&quot;

Ryo then pulled back. Determined to win, he stamped both of his feet to 
the ground, and pressed a gap of about half a metre between the two. The 
Japanese fighter soon gripped his hands into fists and then deftly 
pulled them back to his sides, one after the other, in classic Asagawa 
motion. He leaned forward from the waist and began gathering all of his 
energy into his fists. His mind began to clear of all distractions and 
ignored all the pain that his body was feeling. To perform this he had 
to be deceptively peaceful in both mind and spirit. Cyria watched this 
curiously but did nothing to stop it. Though the stance looked familiar, 
she couldn&#39;t quite place what technique this was. Ryo slipped his eyes 
shut and began focusing his energies to an even greater degree with his 
new air of tranquillity. 

He then quickly opened those fists of his and spread his palms. He drew 
them back even further, both his hand switching to vertical positions as 
they were dragged along. Ryo&#39;s eyes broke open again. And his mouth 
called out the attack as he forced both of his palms forwards at the 
target, 

&quot;Fire Wave!&quot;

Straight from Ryo&#39;s hands came a wide, cannonshell of blustering spirit 
fire energy. It coursed around its centre like a drilling object and was 
shot directly for the enemy. Cyria&#39;s eyes narrowed when she saw it 
speedily coming for her; burning the air around it. Her cape blew out of 
her way and she stuck out her arms suddenly. The Fire Wave crashed into 
an almost invisible shield of spiritual energy produced from her hands. 
But it didn&#39;t dissipate in that instant. The Fire Wave followed its form 
and drilled into the spiritual defensive shield, startling Cyria a 
little. Now she began to realize what this move was and where she had 
seen it. That thought angered her beyond belief. And she screamed out 
angrily from impulse. This anger was reflected when the shield convulsed 
against the Fire Wave, shattering it into scraps of embers. Those embers 
fell to the floor and set alight that carpet of the office. But Cyria 
was far more concerned with the ability that Ryo had just used.

&quot;The Fire Wave...&quot; She seethed, &quot;...Tsukasa&#39;s technique... it seems that 
you&#39;re a little more skilful than I first believed. If you can use 
Energy Waves then this makes the fight a little bit more interesting. 
Heh. Follow me...&quot;

The bruised Ryo watched Cyria crank her neck backwards and stare up at 
the ceiling. Her fists tightened together and she pushed one of her 
hands upwards. While the hand pointed to the ceiling. Another bright 
purple glow encircled that hand. Streaks of electric energy ran up and 
down that whole arm and showed Ryo the power that was being generated 
there. Suddenly Cyria&#39;s arm shuddered as she shot an Energy Wave of her 
own. A crystalline sphere of amethyst spirit power broke into the air 
and bombarded the ceiling above Cyria. The foundations of the room 
juddered from the potency of the technique. Rubble began falling down 
around Cyria. A wide hole had been blown into the ceiling. Providing a 
clear view of the stars of the night sky. Ryo looked on as Cyria jumped 
upwards through that hole. She wanted to continue their fight on the 
roof of the Rainthorn Building. It would probably be more dangerous up 
there. But he would follow her with all that blind courage of his. 

Ryo ran over to that point in the room and he leapt up through the hole 
in the roof himself. His body was now bathed in the cool night air that 
was of the outside. He landed on the rooftop of the Rainthorn Building 
itself. A huge stone clearing; with the added beeps of car horns and 
tire burning as the melody of the backdrop from the busy streets below. 
Cyria was across from him by about twenty metres. Waiting for the boy to 
make his arrival.

&quot;Aha, ha, ha, ha!&quot; Cyria laughed, &quot;Now the entire city can watch you 
perish! Nothing can match the power of my Evil Soul!&quot;

Cyria pointed her hand towards Ryo in the same way that she had done 
against the ceiling of her office. That same technique again. Purple 
energy circled the hand and lightning passed up and down it. The cape of 
the woman blew back when she fired the second of those &#145;Cyria Shots&#39;. It 
burned a path through the cold night air and towards Ryo. The younger 
warrior narrowed his eyes and darted to one side of the blast. It zoomed 
past him and off the edge of the roof, travelling all the way across to 
one of the neighbouring skyscrapers. It exploded upon contact with that 
tall building. Causing stray debris to fall from the blast point and 
down unto all those who might happen to be walking along the distant 
pavements below. Ryo scowled at that. This woman was endangering 
innocent people just to kill him. And yet it didn&#39;t seem to bother her 
at all. He ran over to her in that instant and drew back his hand. He 
had to stop her. Cyria smiled at the boy. His whole body was added to 
the force of his attempted punch. Like before she stepped aside from the 
attack and replied with another unruly blow of her own. But that one was 
bang on the mark. Ryo&#39;s face was pelted with the smack back of a kick, 
which was followed by a second kick from Cyria via the other leg. Ryo 
tried to thrust his elbowed at her waist anyway, undaunted. Cyria caught 
the elbow attack between her palms and then bashed her forehead into the 
younger man&#39;s skull. Not a flashy skill but it made its mark. Ryo&#39;s 
upper body swung backwards from the force of the headbutt. Then Cyria 
went on the offensive. Her hands worked with blurry movement as she 
began pounding Ryo in the stomach and upper abdomen with a series of 
speedy body blows. Again and again and again. Ryo was helpless to do 
anything but stand there and be hit whilst his ribcage was battered with 
dozens of quick and equally powerful punches. Cyria&#39;s knuckles made the 
finisher with one last punch. The Japanese youth let off a heart-rending 
scream of agony into the night atmosphere. The last blow had fractured a 
rib. He could feel it. Cyria sneered at his back and spun around on her 
hips, extending her leg. Ryo was roundhouse kicked across the face and 
batted away like a rag doll. He tumbled face down into the ground and 
his facial flesh burned with friction against that cold roof stone. His 
body kept skidding until it went off the very rim of that skyscraper 
known as the Rainthorn Building. 

Ryo desperately grabbed onto the edge stones of the roof and hung on for 
dear life. It was a LONG drop down. Falling off that building meant 
guaranteed death. The wounded fighter swung his body upwards and flipped 
onto the rooftop before that could happen. Cyria stood away from him as 
usual, still laughing to herself. Ryo wiped the blood from his mouth 
with one hand and held his cracked rib with the other. The woman was a 
total and complete bitch but he had to respect that power of hers. 
And... he had to figure out a way of defeating that power. 

But Cyria led off before he had the time to think of a way. She stuck 
out her arm again and her hand began to glow lavender. The lightning 
streaks reappeared and a third Cyria Shot was fired at Ryo. The 
deafening roar of the release of the attack thundered around that 
rooftop. The Asagawa-youth dashed around the incoming energy wave to 
avoid it. But Cyria had a little plan of her own. She pressed her hands 
together and closed those smooth cobalt eyes. The natural glow of her 
Chi, the tint of amethyst, started surrounding her again. Then in the 
blink of an eye... she vanished. 

The ailing Ryo gasped with confusion at that, until he heard a familiar 
voice whisper into his ear. &quot;Behind you, sweetie.&quot;

No response was made. Cyria punched Ryo in the back violently. He was 
tossed forwards again and thrown back into the dusty stone of the 
Rainthorn Building&#39;s rooftop. When his body came to a stop, he coughed 
up a gob of blood which splattered on the stone floor. 
&quot;...T-Teleportation...?&quot;

Got it in one. Cyria laughed to herself again in that echoing, powerful 
voice. Her powers had increased since the battle with Tsukasa. Her 
teleportation technique was something he didn&#39;t get to have a taste 
of... but his son would have all the pleasure of experiencing. Once she 
crossed her arms together she floated over to the downed Ryo. 

&quot;Stupid Child,&quot; She spat, &quot;You actually call yourself the son of 
Tsukasa? You fight like a novice. Repeating the same dim-witted 
mistakes. Charging at me blindly. Your father was sleek of movement, 
skilled of grace, intelligent and powerful. While you? You&#39;re nothing 
but a little brat.&quot;

Cyria stamped her heel into the back of Ryo&#39;s skull to rub in the point. 
&quot;...You don&#39;t deserve the name Asagawa, weakling. I&#39;m going to grind you 
into dust. Nothing will be left of you but a memory. Then you can join 
your Father in heaven!&quot;

But by now, Ryo had had enough of that. &quot;...Shut... the fuck... UP!&quot;

In one huge burst of adrenalin, Ryo kicked out of Cyria&#39;s reach and 
rolled right out of the way. With arm still clutching his cracked rib, 
the young man stood up from the dust and grit his teeth hard at the 
older woman. A vein throbbed at the boy&#39;s temple. And his reserves of 
energy were fast reaching the top of the well. Though one of his ribs 
were broken, his lip bloody and his face battered and bruised; his Chi 
was still roaring with anger and determination. 

But Cyria was right. 

He had been making the same mistakes over and over and over again. Well 
no more. He was worthy. Ryo might not want have wanted to live in his 
Father&#39;s shadow but he was more than capable of creating his own. He was 
an Asagawa. In blood, name and spirit. There was no WAY he would allow 
some narcissistic, power-hungry lunatic deride who he was. 

It was time for the tables to turn. But this time Ryo would use a few 
mental tactics to bring about that win. &quot;...No wonder you&#39;re so strong, 
Cyria. You must get all this power from that over-inflated ego of 
yours.&quot;

Cyria&#39;s smile fell. &quot;...W-What did you just say?!&quot;

&quot;Egotism comes so naturally to you, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Ryo quipped, &quot;You&#39;re no 
warrior. Just some random woman with a complex about a power she didn&#39;t 
even earn. I dunno why God saw fit to give you such strength... but it 
doesn&#39;t amount to much with that kind of vanity.&quot;

A cold purple residue of Chi-influenced rage rose from Cyria. &quot;Silence, 
boy!&quot;

And to that, Ryo grinned deceptively. He had a plan. But for it to work 
he needed this woman to be angry enough to lead off and attack him 
outright. While Ryo continued speaking, Chi flames began burning at his 
hands. &quot;Something up there, girl? Or don&#39;t you like being told the 
truth? You know, I bet for ALL that power you possess... you don&#39;t have 
single friend to call your own, do you? Ain&#39;t it ironic that the most 
vain and self-important of the people I have ever fought turns out to 
have the saddest and most pathetic life imaginable? No wonder you&#39;re so 
drunk on yourself. Your Evil Soul is the only thing worthwhile in your 
life, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;...Why you insolent boy!&quot; Cyria bellowed, now charging over at him, 
&quot;I&#39;ll close your mouth for good!&quot;

Perfect. Ryo grinned at the woman while the flames in his hands remained 
unnoticed. Now if he could just time this right. Cyria zoomed over to 
him and thrust out her fist as she neared Ryo. The boy took a deep 
breath and dodged as fast as he could to the left. He hurled his body 
out of the way and sidestepped the attack. Cyria&#39;s eyes widened and she 
realized that she had actually missed Ryo. But the second that he was 
out of harm&#39;s way he ran straight back into the storm. The youngster 
kicked out his leg and dashed over the stone of the ground like a razor 
over ice. Just as the flames of his Chi delimited the attacking leg. 
Cyria gasped violently and her face was struck dead on by the flaming 
heel of Ryo&#39;s Lance Raid attack. She was sent into the ground, at long 
last toppled for once, her cape falling on top of her. 

Ryo didn&#39;t stand and gloat. He jumped right into the cold air above. 
While he observed the downed Cyria from below... the flames around his 
fists now became bluntly visible. The great snarl of the crackling fire 
emanated sharply to the ears of both Ryo and Cyria. Cinders arose from 
the fire around his hands, glowing like bright fireflies in the chilly 
nocturne space. Ryo brought both of his flaming hands together, swerved 
them into a vertical position and released a bestial howl from the crux 
of his throat. 

&quot;Orraaaagggghhh!&quot; He screamed, &quot;Inferno Wave!&quot;

That dark rooftop was suddenly brightened with the radiance of a 
smouldering orange fire energy when the Inferno Wave was released from 
Ryo Asagawa&#39;s palms. A larger and far more destructive version of the 
Fire Wave burst into the night air and slowly descended for Cyria like a 
drifting asteroid. The woman looked up from the floor as the air grew 
hotter and more stagnant. And she saw that penetrating cluster of flame 
and spirit coming her way. She gasped and extended her arm to produce a 
spiritual shield for a defence against it. The Inferno Wave drilled 
itself into the shield and began testing its fortitude to the limit. 
Cyria grit her teeth and struggled against its power in ways she would 
have never thought imaginable. Sweat trickled down her face from both 
the heat of the Inferno Wave and the stress of holding it back. Her 
muscles tensed and her senses were on red alert. But it was too much. 
Too sudden. Too powerful. For the first time in her whole life, Cyria 
expressed a scream of fright as the Inferno Wave completely shattered 
her spiritual defence and overwhelmed her. The English woman produced 
more terrified screams as she was swallowed up by the savage flames of 
Ryo&#39;s ultimate attack. The strength of the blast crushed the stone of 
the rooftop beneath Cyria and it all collapsed around her. That part of 
the rooftop caved in amid burning hot fire. Taking Cyria along with it, 
sending her back into the office. Ryo soon landed from his jump. His 
breath was heavy and his bleeding was growing worse. Not to mention the 
pain of his broken rib. His Chi was now running low after that shot. But 
he had to keep going. The boy jumped again through the large, cavernous 
hole that had carved into the roof via the drilling flames of his 
Inferno Wave attack. Ryo descended and found himself inside Cyria&#39;s 
office again. Across from him was a now not-so-grand Cyria herself. 

The mistress of Evil Soul was breathing just as deeply as Ryo. Half of 
her cape was burned right off. Her clothes were charred and blackened, 
and the right side of her face was now seeping with blood. The 
expression on her face showed her rage. But even more than that... her 
fear. Ryo pulled up a fighting stance. This office was completely 
infested with flames. From both the Inferno Wave and the previous Fire 
Wave. Smoke was rising higher and higher. But neither fighter was 
leaving until they won. After gathering some more power into himself, 
Ryo began a charge at the weakened Cyria.  She stood her ground but was 
too injured to dodge like she had been doing before. Her face was batted 
to one side as Ryo pummelled her with a sharp punch. Which was taken up 
after by a vicious kick across the other cheek. Ryo shoved his knee into 
the woman&#39;s gut to make her lean over with a choke. Then drove his elbow 
into her back. She cried out and attempted to fight back, but by now, 
Ryo was in overdrive. He began battering the woman with repeated strikes 
and combos that caused Cyria&#39;s blood to splash onto the burning carpet 
with each strike. One final punch caused Cyria to fall limply to the 
ground. 

Ryo sucked in breath hard. She wasn&#39;t getting back up. The fight was 
over. He coughed on the smoke of the office but concentrated on what he 
came here for. Ryo crouched down and grabbed Cyria by the collar of her 
burnt red top, yanking her bloody face to his own bloody face. 

&quot;Now!&quot; Ryo shouted, breathlessly, &quot;You&#39;re... gonna... talk...! Who 
killed... my Dad!?&quot;

Cyria pulled a weak smile and her eyes lulled. &quot;...I am defeated...&quot;

&quot;...A-Answer me!&quot;

But the English woman simply repeated herself. &quot;...I am defeated...&quot;

She wasn&#39;t talking. It looked like she was in shock. Ryo cursed and 
tossed the woman&#39;s collar aside. He had won the battle... but what was 
it all for if he couldn&#39;t get that information? The Japanese lad coughed 
violently from the smoke and held his ribcage. The whole of the room was 
alive with fire. 

But a third voice called out to him. &quot;...Ryo...!&quot;

By now Ryo was almost out of energy. He could hardly move to escape the 
flames. But he looked over the burning office to the doorway. It was 
Kayde. The American youth held a hand over his face to block out the 
smoke of the fire. He darted between all of the individual upsurges and 
quickly made his way to Ryo.

Ryo smiled tiredly. &quot;...It&#39;s good... to see you... Kayde...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk. I&#39;ll get you out of here,&quot; Kayde said, hooking Ryo&#39;s left 
arm over his shoulders and helping him up, &quot;C&#39;mon, just lean on me.&quot;

The Asagawa-boy did just that. And Kayde helped him past all the fire 
and smoke of the office. But he couldn&#39;t help but look back at Cyria; 
stunned senseless by her seemingly incomprehensible defeat. &quot;...W-What 
about... Cyria...?&quot;

&quot;Forget her!&quot; Kayde replied angrily, &quot;She&#39;s caused enough damage as it 
is. Lets just get out of here for now. Then we can get you checked out 
for all those cuts and bruises.&quot;

The two teens then left the office and began making their way to the 
lift. But Cyria stayed as the flames in that office grew worse. She 
choked upon the smoke but did nothing to move herself. That was until a 
completely new figure emerged from the shadows of the fire. Cyria was at 
first believing that it was a hallucination caused by the extreme heat. 
But this figure was quite real. A man of around forty or so years of 
age. Dressed in rugged but yet somehow elegant green combat attire. And 
possessing a cunningly perceptive smile. This man... the very C.E.O. of 
the KAIGA Group. 

The wounded Cyria could hardly believe it. &quot;...Reinhalt... 
Schwarzluft...&quot;

Reinhalt smirked at Cyria, speaking in that superior German accent. 
&quot;Worthless. Why did I leave the Sunset City branch in your incompetent 
hands? To think that you would put your own wishes before my direct 
orders. You fool. And you actually thought that you could defeat a Child 
of Gaia? Heh. You have deluded yourself, Cyria Mau.&quot;

Cyria reached out to him. &quot;H-Help... me...&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t come here to help you. I came here to see if the rumours about 
your actions were true. And now I see that they are. You are a disgrace 
to the KAIGA Group. And for your treachery... you will die here with 
your office. Burn here in the pigmy empire you thought you could amass.&quot;

Reinhalt sneered at the woman one last time. Then strode off to leave 
Cyria behind. The mistress of the Evil Soul was left to burn in her 
office of the Rainthorn Building. But nothing burned brighter or more 
maliciously than her will for revenge...

I find it such a shame
Through the pain I see things as they are
We&#39;re served up on a plate 
The pedestal is high enough to fall

Would anyone change it anyhow
Our time is up

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts
===================

* Well there you have it. I&#39;d be lying if I said that this story was not 
inspired a little by Fatal Fury but I&#39;d like to think that it came off 
with an aura all of its own. The original idea I had for the story was 
nothing like this; some characters had to be put into the background 
(i.e Kayde and Yun-Yun) more than I intended. But I decided to keep this 
story compact but furious; unlike &#39;The Tokyo Dragons&#39; in which is mild 
but wide reaching, if you know what I mean.

* Eventually, the characters from Sunset City will cross over with those 
from The Tokyo Dragons (aside from just Reinhalt). But for now, their 
stories will remain seperate. 

* The song &#39;Genocide&#39; was not written by me. It is property of The 
Offspring and Epitaph.
