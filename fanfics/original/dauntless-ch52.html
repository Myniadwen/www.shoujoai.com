<p>“Avatar: advent of the Night Hammer goddess!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me that way, Vimmy,” Mink said,  unfazed by the Norgrim’s glare. “I told you that I was quitting,  didn’t I? Your unscrupulous ways have pushed me far enough; I want  to be on my own now. Don’t you remember me saying that? I’m no  longer your personal assistant, Vimmy, so please don’t blame me for  not picking you up.”</p>
<p>“<em>Someone</em> on this ship is to blame,” she  snarled quietly, speaking slowly and carefully for the first time  Mink ever remembered, “and I do mean to find the perpetrator  responsible for leaving me behind on that world, oh yes my dear, and  you’re my primary suspect, you know, I never imagined you could  ever rebel against me, how utterly ungrateful you are, yes,  especially since most Yuns would <em>crawl</em> on their <em>bellies</em> just to get a chance to work with me, oh yes, and lick the dust off  my— ”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. You’ve made your point. Mistakes  were made and people have apologized. It’s time to let it go.”  Vimmy glared even more hotly than before, but her stares were useless  now: Mink was too strong, too noble, and too beautiful now to be  swayed by her former master’s moods. Her mind and body were united  now; Vimmy could see it in her eyes. Mink was a whole new person, and  she would never go back, not for anything.</p>
<p>“Ungrateful,” Vimmy muttered as she waddled away,  “simply ungrateful, yes, that’s what she is, the nerve of that  Mink of mine, and after all the good things I said about her…” As  the door closed, Mink was finally released at last: Vimmy had severed  the last cord. Her heart suddenly felt so full, her shoulders loose  and light, and whatever doubts and questions were nagging at her mind  were now gone, completely erased, leaving everything…clear and  clean. So this is what it felt like to be her own person. It  was…nice. The only real problem was what to do with so much  freedom.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>A faint smile crept on her mouth as a thought came to  mind. She left her room silently.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“The Helios system?”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” Lyara said. “Even though  Sharyn’s planet really doesn’t need our help anymore, I sort of  feel obligated to go there and see her quest ended.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing all this for her sake?” Amy asked.  Lyara smiled sadly.</p>
<p>“I guess that’s the sort of person I’ve become  now. I…hope you don’t mind my selfish request.” Just as Lyara  expected, Amy smiled joyously at her response and gave her a loving  answer.</p>
<p>“We’re all entitled to a little selfishness once in  awhile. But you know, this request really isn’t all that selfish.  You’re doing this for the woman you love.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she whispered meekly. Amy grinned and wiped  her glasses.</p>
<p>“It’s a little out of our way, but I don’t see  the harm. Actually…yeah, you know, now’s probably the best time  for it. It <em>should</em> be that time now. …Uh, what was I saying?”  Lyara couldn’t help but smile; the dear woman was spacing out and  saying nonsense again.</p>
<p>“The Helios System.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I was just thinking it’s about time we go  there. I have family on Pluto, you know— Helios 9.”</p>
<p>“Oh? I’m envious. I never knew my real family.  Sharyn’s all I have now.”</p>
<p>“So it’s not so bad anymore, then?” she said,  eyes glittering with beautiful love. Lyara couldn’t help but blush,  even though Sharyn was first in her heart. Despite how common, plain,  and even silly she looked at times, there was something irrefutably  attractive about Amy Miracle that had charmed the whole crew to her  side. Even rogues like Lillianne, Aseria, Naja, and Yenae had fallen  for her. “Good to hear it,” she continued. “I also have  business on Perel— on Venus, you know, which is the second planet.  And I’m sure plenty of the girls from Earth would like to return  home.”</p>
<p>“I have always been curious about Gaea,” Lyara  muttered.</p>
<p>“It’s not much of a surprise, considering the elves  came from…uh, what were we talking about?” Lyara grinned  helplessly and flicked Amy’s forehead, making the scatterbrained  sweetheart wince. “Mmnh…so I guess that’s our next destination,  huh? Well, I’ll go tell Kay and Tee, unless they’re not at the  helm, in which case, I’ll have to ask Aseria. I have a suspicious  feeling that all of our pilots are taking sexual liberties, though.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you fly the <em>Dauntless</em>? It is your  ship, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t buy it or build it if that’s what  you’re asking. I suppose you could say it’s on loan. Anyway,  there are these pedals you have to use your feet for, so…”</p>
<p>“Oh, right, I’m sorry. I’ve never actually seen  the cockpit before.”</p>
<p>“Why not go there as a liaison?” she chirped,  pushing Lyara in that direction. For a limping bookworm, Amy was  surprisingly persistent, but then again, once you’ve stood up to  the UCM with a band of pirates, survived on a hostile world with only  a foul-mouthed harpy for a companion, and stared the Angel of Death  in the face, there’s not much else that can stop you. Lyara burst  in on the cockpit and blushed as she saw that the Acheron sisters  were at the helm— utterly naked and in a rather compromising  situation.</p>
<p>“Do you <em>mind</em>?!” Kay shouted. Tee laughed.</p>
<p>“Hey, just in time! Kay and I always wanted to have a  four-way!”</p>
<p>“Shut UP! I was drunk at the time! I didn’t mean  any of that!”</p>
<p>“Ahuh, sure.”</p>
<p>“Hey, watch where you’re sticking your fingers!  Keep them on <em>your </em>side! YOUR side!” Their lover waved at her  with three of her six arms.</p>
<p>“Hey, you know, if you’re not gonna join us or take  a picture, would you mind leaving us and closing the door?”</p>
<p>“I just wanted to suggest a destination!” Lyara  yelled, covering her eyes quickly. The worst part was that, despite  how abominable it sounded, watching a two-headed woman make love to a  six-armed woman was eerily arousing.</p>
<p>“Oh? Are we going…down?”</p>
<p>“Tee, shut uh…uh…UH…OH GOD, VALTI, WHAT ARE  YOU…ooohhhh…”</p>
<p>“Helios!!!!” Lyara screamed as she turned around  and bolted out of there. She made a beeline for the “cold” sauna  and didn’t come out for some time.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>If only the people from Earth had known how close they  were to intelligent life, they might not have spent so many frivolous  years searching for it— but then again, they might have just as  well set out to conquer or wipe out the other civilizations, as they  have before in history. Avatar was perhaps the closest “civilized”  planet to the Helios system; it had evaded astronomers’ eyes for  all this time because certain magnetic storms blocked them out from  all receptors, acting as a sort of “stealth shield” to hide them  until the Gaeans were ready for contact.</p>
<p>Humans were a bit disappointed to find out the first  “aliens” they met were not the silly “little green men” they  had always envisioned— neither the monstrosities of H.G. Wells nor  the bulb-headed wormlike creatures from more modern perspectives—  but other humans, in fact. Yet there was something comforting in this  encounter, and something just as controversial. The religious shouted  that it was impossible for other worlds to have men and women, while  the scientists kept their hands behind their back, whistling smugly,  pointing out that an interplanetary “farmer” could very well have  seeded many worlds with their kin, and perhaps somewhere out in the  universe, they all had a single, common ancestor— not a thing like  the shuffling ape-men of archaeology, but recognizably humane.</p>
<p>Avatar was one of the earliest planets humanity visited  once it became serious about space exploration (scarcely a hundred  years earlier, actually), and for good reason. It was a diverse,  bustling commerce world, where it was reputed one could find anything  if one looked in the right places, and towers stretched all the way  to the clouds. Those from every corner of the galaxy came to meet,  trade, and create their life here, but not all dreams and ambitions  are pure: Avatar also had its dark side, and Lyara knew that better  than any other member of the crew. She sat quietly in her room as the <em>Dauntless</em> approached the small system: one would have to go  through here to reach Helios, or else waste days on end going around.  In a sense, she would soon be confronting her checkered past.</p>
<p>Not that the Acherons really cared. They were too busy  trying to weasel their way through customs. A very impatient and  nasally voice cringed at them over the transmission: “Unidentified  ship, you are approaching Avatar space. Be advised that all vessels  are required to undergo mandatory searches. Identify yourself and  prepare to be boarded. This is <em>not</em> a request.”</p>
<p>“Kindly fuck yourself, control tower,” Kay  murmured, focusing more on the course than the threat. “We have no  business with you and no intention of approaching your planet. We’re  on our way to Helios.”</p>
<p>“And we don’t take kindly to threats from small  people,” Tee added, smiling at her sister. The person on the other  end snarled.</p>
<p>“Bitch! I’ll give you one last chance to cooperate!  Otherwise, we <em>will</em> open fire! We can carve our initials into  the moon, woman, so don’t think you’ll walk away unscathed!”</p>
<p>“You must feel so proud of your meaningless  accomplishments,” Tee crooned sourly. “But like I said, we have  nothing to do with Avatar.”</p>
<p>“We’re not under any planetary jurisdiction anyway,  so don’t think you can push us around,” Kay added. The person on  the other end said nothing for a few seconds. Then came the chilling:  “So you’ve signed your own death-warrants.”</p>
<p>“Sheesh, and I thought Naja had a stick up her ass,”  Tee murmured as she sped away.</p>
<p>“It’s probably Lyara’s fault they’re so  hostile,” Kay reasoned.</p>
<p>“Yeah? You think she pissed off the wrong person?”</p>
<p>“Maybe it was something she <em>didn’t</em> do. In  any case— ”</p>
<p>Kay didn’t get to finish her thought; the <em>Dauntless</em> was starting to careen out of control. Their skill had helped them  avoid the brunt of the blast from Avatar, but the shockwaves  generated by it threw the ship into a loop. They were fighting to  keep afloat, and it was thanks to the harnesses that nobody was  dashed to bits as the ship rocked around. Rachel actually flew  outside of the ship and helped deflect the second blast, splintering  it into hundreds of smaller rays. Of course, it was impossible to  dodge them all, and in spite of her valiant efforts, the crew was not  very grateful.</p>
<p>“Well, I couldn’t deflect it, or else it’d just  hit something else, like a planet or another ship, and if I absorbed  it, I’d have to release it eventually. I’d rather not be on the  ship when I let go of all that energy.”</p>
<p>“Okay, just shut up and help us out of this!”  Rachel looked to her master for permission, but the poor girl was out  cold. Since Amy had appointed no second-in-command, Rachel left the  decision to the pilots, who ordered her to either repair the ship or  cushion it, because it was hurtling straight for Avatar. Acting  quickly, Rachel took all the ship’s water, transported it outside,  froze it solid, and wrapped it around the plunging vessel, saving it  from incineration as it fell through the atmosphere. Once they were  in the sky, she called out a great gust of wind and battered the ship  until it slowed down and landed, rather shakily, in a coppice. The  trees were utterly ruined, of course, but now the <em>Dauntless</em> had good camouflage from Avatar authorities.</p>
<p>“Ow,” Kay winced, slowly rising to her feet. Even  with Rachel’s intervention, the harnesses had squeezed the life out  of the Acherons (and nearly everyone else), the <em>Dauntless</em> was  tattered and torn apart, and everyone was disoriented and injured to  some degree— but all alive and able to walk, at least. The ship was  dark and dense with quiet, and with communications off and the power  hiccupping, it was some time before everybody found everybody else  and stepped out to assess the damage. Once more, all eyes turned to  Eve and Herut for their expert opinion.</p>
<p>“Shee-yit!” Kasberry exclaimed, whistling loudly at  the wreckage. “Is this the same ship? Tell me Rachel didn’t  switch them somehow. Damn! I don’t mean to sound pessimistic here,  people, but we might be better off buying a whole new ship! Even my  old woman would be stumped.”</p>
<p>“Implausible, but not impossible,” Herut offered.  “I’d like to believe that everything can be repaired, but a job  of this magnitude will require more than we have.”</p>
<p>“If it’s money you need, that won’t be an issue,”  Vimmy squeaked. It had been such a long time since anybody remembered  hearing her act so meek that people doubted she had really spoken. “I  mean, you know, I’ve got some money with me, and a bit of pull,  too, if that’s what you need, I rather liked that ship, yes, I  don’t want to buy another, I could stay here and help you gals buy  the proper parts, indeed I could, and hire some labor if that’s  going to be an issue, but oh, don’t expect me to work, why, these  hands of mine are so delicate!”</p>
<p>“So it <em>was </em>her,” Aseria murmured. “Well, I  really don’t care either way, but whatever we’re going to do, we  should do it fast. That control tower didn’t exactly give us a warm  welcome. Where’s Miracle?”</p>
<p>“Still unconscious, I’m afraid,” Fuuka sighed.  Amy had gotten a nasty bump on the head that blacked her out, but  Fuuka assured everyone it was nothing to worry about. “I think,  however, that she would vote to keep the ship and repair it. It’s  sort of become our home now.”</p>
<p>“Our home?” Lyara said, crossing her arms as she  gazed at Avatar’s bittersweet familiarity. She obviously had mixed  feelings about being here, and looked so enveloped by them that she  seemed as distant as the stars. “How fortunate for everyone. This  is the only home I’ve ever known.”</p>
<p>“Then you have some explaining to do, I think,”  Kate said, gentle but firm.</p>
<p>“Yeah, tell us what’s up! Why the hell did we get  blasted outta the sky? Was it something you did?”</p>
<p>“Well, in a way— probably,” she murmured  ambiguously. Lil snarled.</p>
<p>“What kind of answer is that?! Gods damn it, you  lousy pointy-eared freak, tell us what the fuck is going on or else  I’ll break your face!”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind me,” Aseria grumbled, resenting the  remarks. Lyara sighed deeply and appeared to return from her forlorn  daze. She smiled, but only at Sharyn.</p>
<p>“Do you want the long story, or the short one? Either  way, the person that shot us down was— or is— a member of the  Night Hammers, my old gang. I recognized his voice immediately.”</p>
<p>“Yeah? So why’d your old gang buddy try to kill us?  Didn’t put out?”</p>
<p>“I never had that many friends to begin with here,”  she murmured, approaching her lover so she could draw strength from  her. “I’m sure that by now, the few loyalists I had have been  executed or exiled. It’s all Asara’s doing— she was originally  our leader’s second-in-command. Let’s just say that when he  passed his mantle to me, there was some…resentment.”</p>
<p>“Clearly,” Athena murmured.</p>
<p>“Hey, there was an Asara from Avatar at the Space  Races,” Shana said— but of course she <em>would</em> remember a  detail like that. “Is it the same one?”</p>
<p>“I have no doubts,” Lyara replied. “In this life,  there are adversaries, rivals, people you don’t get along with, and  flat-out enemies. Asara is the most dangerous kind. She will commit <em>atrocities</em> to maintain order around here; I’ve seen it  happen.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you <em>should </em>tell us the whole story,”  Allegra suggested. “I’m no mechanic, so I figure I’m not much  good for anything else here. May as well keep me entertained.”</p>
<p>“It’s a very long story,” Lyara warned her, “and  I doubt we have the time to hear it. But I’ll try and give it  justice. Let’s cover up the ship first, though. Rachel, do you  think you can hide our location?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably what my Master would want,” she  reasoned.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>One descended from the highest of all elves that  migrated from Numinor after the Cataclysm had a heart as great and  pure as the beautiful ocean, and she believed she could remain a pure  maiden even as she set out to “find herself”. We all dream of a  journey that will “define” us, but Lyara Tanith actually took  one, sailing in a Valari ship away from the world of her birth into  the vastness of Deep Heaven. Time and space brought her to Avatar,  where she was gradually thrust into darkness, tainting her once-noble  heart. Humanity, it seemed, had a distinct grudge towards aliens and  outsiders— at least on Avatar they did— and while it rarely came  down to actual violence, the silent oppression, which continued to  stretch for years and tear away at the minority groups, eroded Lyara  and made her a more cynical woman. After a few months attempting to  ingrain herself into high society, she met with failure and poverty,  and was forced into Lowtown, where she was forced into demeaning  labor with little pay. This harsh lifestyle lasted a year, and it  blotted out almost all of her innocence, leaving only a pinprick of  light left on her hardened heart.</p>
<p>The gang attacking her suddenly, without provocation,  was the final straw. She was still beautiful, even after living in  squalor, and lecherous people had always had their eyes on her. One  of them went too far one day, and might have raped her but for Valari  pride and the innate strength her race possessed. He had friends,  however, who surrounded her one day, forcing her to kill— and to  retreat. The next few days were spent running and hiding; her wounds,  exhaustion, and hunger took their toll until finally it felt as if  she could manage little more than a feeble demise. But she clung on,  and was found by another gang— the enemies of the people she had  unleashed her vengeance upon, and thanks to her actions, her new  friends.</p>
<p>Lyara had no other way to repay their generosity, and  since she couldn’t afford making more enemies, she was forced to  join them. Over the next couple of years, she rose in stature among  her gang, the Night Hammers, proving herself time and again. She came  to enjoy her life, and the camaraderie of her new friends, though  occasionally she was called on to do things that upset her and  troubled her conscious. For the most part, though, her new family was  actually not so bad: they were far more moderate than their brutal  rivals. They did extort money and do questionable deeds, but they  also actually protected those who paid for that protection, unlike  most of the other gangs. She soon became the favored member of the  current leader, who shared her moderate view and disdained in the  more atrocious acts some of the other gangs performed. He soon became  like a father to her, and helped heal her battered soul the most.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many months later, their leader  was assassinated. Asara, the second in command and an accomplished  but violent enforcer, was poised to take charge, but Lyara had gained  a great deal of respect from many of the other members. Due to her  standing with the former leader and her similar views, it was Lyara  who hesitantly took leadership, aiming to clean Avatar of its filth  and eliminate racial prejudices. Asara had wanted to conquer their  world; Lyara merely wanted to improve it. The two had been bitterly  fierce rivals up until then, but when their leader passed away, they  became enemies.<br />
  Lyara continued her mentor's moderate leadership,  and though it seemed to go well enough, trouble was brewing in the  background. Asara obviously felt wronged on many levels: she was  supposed to be the new leader, and not only was Lyara as soft as the  previous boss, she seemed to be even more lenient with their  &quot;subjects&quot;. Asara had disagreed strongly with the direction  the gang was heading when the old master was alive, and some even  suspected she had a hand in the assassination, but Lyara was even  “worse”, and it upset her greatly. She gathered many of her  strongest allies in the gang and began plotting a coup, secretly  subverting Lyara to the other members, second-guessing many of her  more compassionate decisions and the fate of their gang should Lyara  stay in power. Though Lyara had many friends in the gang, a great  number of them were deceived by Asara's reasoning, fearing their  apparent weakening would lead to their destruction.<br />
  A few friends  remained loyal to Lyara, though, and thanks to their information, she  remained aware that her grasp of leadership was growing tenuous.  Unfortunately, there was little she could do to win them back: Asara  had gained too much hold, and the coup was imminent. It was all she  could do to escape with her life, thanks to the aid of her last  friends. Having taken a sizable amount of　  money before fleeing, she  boarded the first transport off-world she could find and didn't look  back. She aimlessly drifted from planet to planet, falling into a  mild depression, and occasionally abused substances to pass the days.  Seeing Miracle’s advertisement took her back to a time when her  innocence was still intact, to the grand images of seeing the galaxy  and making a life for herself, and Lyara thought that, perhaps, this  could be the first step back on that road…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Amy Miracle came around just in time to cast her vote:  who would explore Avatar for the supplies they needed and who would  stay with the ship, to protect it and attempt a repair. The former  had fewer numbers, of course, and Lyara knew she would have to be a  part of that group, but she had always felt that she would need to  confront her bleak past at some point in time. It warmed her heart to  learn that Sharyn would join her, and she felt like she could finally  be rid of this history of hers and start anew.</p>
<p>“If the Hammers haven’t completely overrun Lowtown  yet, we’ll probably find some parts there,” she explained. “Most  of the dealers are cons, though, and they hardly have anything more  than junk, but sometimes you get lucky. There are slightly more  commercial shops in the Radio District, which is three kilos east and  a few stories up, but I’m sure the Hammers have clawed out a chunk  of it by now; Asara mentioned taking it over. Vimmy, you’d probably  do everyone a favor by looking at the Pinnacle, the rich folks’  district. You should be safe there, but Kate and Allegra will take  care of you just in case.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather it be Mink, that traitorous ingrate,  how dare she abandon me at such a pivotal time, honestly now, is her  personal freedom really that great— ”</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s enough ranting,” Allegra said  gently. “You’re the merchant and we’re your bodyguards, and  there ain’t no reason to go any further. We’ll meet y’all back  at the ship in a few hours.”</p>
<p>“Take care— I mean it! Well, I guess that leaves  us,” she said, turning to Sharyn.</p>
<p>“Aye, but is it wise for thee to be so conspicuous?  After hearing thy tale, my concerns for thy well-being have weighed  upon me.” Lyara smiled warmly.</p>
<p>“Believe me, I know how you’re feeling. But it’s  time I stop hiding and face this. I left Avatar behind because I  wasn’t strong enough to stand against my enemies, and because I  wanted to reclaim that lost little portion of my soul that had been  eradicated. You, my dear, have filled me up so fully, that I feel I  can confront all the horrors of the world. Do not fear for me. I will  not leave this world until I have corrected my mistakes. Will  you…stay with me?”</p>
<p>“You needn’t even ask!” she insisted, grasping  Lyara’s arm. “Thou hast been patient with my childish demands,  and I must repay your kindness. Besides,” she added sweetly, “I  am in love with thee— and it is different from all my previous  experiences.”</p>
<p>“Ah yes, <em>those</em>. We’ll have to talk about  them someday.” She smiled dryly, winked, and nudged her embarrassed  lover before setting off into the depths of Avatar, Dante and  Beatrice journeying to the Inferno. This was a rather apt metaphor,  as the slums of Lowtown were dark, polluted, vile, overcrowded nests  of vipers, rats, and wolves in human disguise. It had been about two  or three years since Lyara abandoned her world, so she hoped she  would go unrecognized as she and Sharyn wandered through the alleys  and streets. Their mission would be ruined if some hapless vagabond  noticed her face and told half the population about her unexpected  return. Sharyn kept her hand on her sword and Lyara clutched a  blaster, both women glaring suspiciously around every corner.</p>
<p>They came to a long and narrow marketplace, a fairly  decent place to hide, even for people as conspicuous as they were  (elves and green-skinned women in armor were unheard of on Avatar).  There were no hiding spots, so they had to blend in as best they  could, and not look like they were hiding from anybody. The two women  nearly made it out of there, ignoring and being ignored, but a firm  hand snapped out and grabbed Lyara’s wrist, pulling her down to the  ground. A large pile of brown rags broke her fall, and another hand  lashed out and covered her mouth. Evidently, the pile of rags was a  man, and he knew Lyara’s face.</p>
<p>“Don’t speak!” he hissed. “You nearly gave <em>me</em> a heart attack, so don’t act so stunned. You, with the strange  clothes, sit down next to me if you don’t want your friend’s neck  snapped. Let’s not make a scene, okay?” Lyara stared firmly at  Sharyn, giving her a nod. The warrior sat down grudgingly, quite  agitated and ready to fight for her lover.</p>
<p>“Thou hast five seconds to explain thyself before  your mortality ends,” she growled.</p>
<p>“Enough with the poetry, my dear— I’m not your  enemy. I can’t explain myself here, so just get up slowly and  follow me into that alley.”</p>
<p>“Do not take us for simpletons, wretch! I shall  entreat you only once.”</p>
<p>“Do as he says!” Lyara said, urging Sharyn  desperately. She wasn’t afraid so much as surprised and excited;  apparently they both knew each other. After some uncertainty, the  three of them found a more private area, and the ragged man released  his hostage, breathing a heavy sigh of relief. Restraining Lyara had  taken all of his strength.</p>
<p>“I always knew you would come back,” he said,  slowly and weakly. “I won’t call you by name even now, but let’s  just say that I’d kiss you if your bodyguard weren’t so jumpy.  But all for a good reason, I suppose. You haven’t aged a day, old  friend.” Lyara’s heart almost jumped out of her chest as the man  removed his hood and gave her a frail, sad smile, like a candle whose  spark has been almost completely extinguished. She sobbed and threw  her arms around him.</p>
<p>“Daniel! My god, now <em>I</em> almost had a heart  attack! Oh, Daniel…I think I will kiss you, bodyguard or not!”  She placed her lips on his eye and caressed his face, happy beyond  expression. Sharyn stood dumbfounded, and a little jealous— after  all, she had no idea how many romantic interests her lover might have  carried before they met— and made awkward introductions. Daniel  bowed and kissed her hands frantically as Lyara explained who he was.</p>
<p>“This man is my blood-brother, the son of our master  and my oldest and most trusted friend. He was the one who helped me  escape this place at last. Oh, Daniel, just look at what she’s done  to you! I know that you were never on very good terms with Asara,  but— ”</p>
<p>“No, I did this to myself,” he muttered, scratching  his head fiercely. “Had to go into hiding once you were gone. Don’t  you worry, I’ve saved up a heap of our old earnings and managed to  find some of the old clan. These rags and this dirt is for show; I  may as well be dead to the rest. By god, old friend, you’re the  answer to a desperate prayer.”</p>
<p>“Forgive me,” she began, but Daniel silenced her  with a long embrace.</p>
<p>“You don’t got nothing to be sorry about, love. All  of this would’ve happened with or without you. You just made things  better for awhile, is all. Hell, I might actually be dead if it  weren’t for you.”</p>
<p>“But don’t the others resent me?” she wondered.  Daniel grimaced and drew away.</p>
<p>“Times have changed too much, friend. Avatar is in  chaos now. The new boss has almost everything under her thumb, except  for a few slices of the Pinnacle. Five months ago, she actually  united most of the other gangs and led a revolt against the Capitol.  You wouldn’t believe the casualties— people were being killed  left and right. By <em>her</em> doing, I mean: our union lost only a  few people. What a bunch of unnecessary losses, and I hear she  laughed most of the way! She did things some of our <em>enemies </em>wouldn’t dream of! Anyway, they have it now, and they’ve  built a fairly organized militia. She’s got the Capitol as her base  and she’s drafting all these people into her ranks: you know,  unemployed people, little kids with no food, desperate criminals,  anybody with a chip on their shoulder. They also restricted most  visitors from coming in— ”</p>
<p>“As we’ve seen,” Sharyn noted.</p>
<p>“Huh, well, you’ve seen that, then. But it gets  worse. She’s like a dictator here, and…oh man, boss, we need you  more than ever! All the other people who turned against her have been  praying for a miracle, and…” Poor Daniel couldn’t speak  anymore; he started crying and fell into Lyara’s arms. She held him  for a moment before asking him a question:</p>
<p>“Daniel, I swear I’ll do whatever I can for you. I  feel so awful for leaving, and I can’t help but think that this is  all my fault. But I need to know: how many of you are there? How many  turned away?”</p>
<p>“There was probably fifteen of us when you left,”  he groaned, still sniffling with joy. “Whoever didn’t join her  was killed or exiled. But now there’s about seventy. They’re that  sick and tired of the whole mess.”</p>
<p>“Seventy?! The Night Hammers barely had a hundred  members when I was leading them! How did they…”</p>
<p>“Like I said, Asara started recruiting, and most of  the people that liked you only joined her because they were afraid.  But now they’ve all had enough. Even some of our old enemies are  calling for a reform. My dear friend,” he said, clasping her hands,  “my only sister in this world…thank you so much for coming here.  Whatever brought you here must’ve been divine intervention; it has  to be. We’re all at our wit’s end!” Lyara took a moment to  absorb all of this in private, then she felt Sharyn touch her, and  was assured by her strength and love.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Daniel, do you know of any good mechanics?”  This question took him aback.</p>
<p>“Um…uh, well, yeah, I do, but what does that have  to do with…oh, wait, did your ship get shot down?”</p>
<p>“Right. I came here with a crew of twenty-three,  including this woman here, and I’m sure I can convince most of them  to help you out. Once all this is over, could you…” She didn’t  need to say another word: Daniel was kissing her hands in thanks.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, yes, yes. We’d pull down the stars for  you— anything you need.”</p>
<p>“Then assemble everyone and meet me at… Meet me at  ‘the Usual Place’ in an hour,” she said with a grin. “I’ll  bring what help I can, and together, we… We can close a dark  chapter on Avatar’s history— and on my conscience.” Daniel  rushed away like a man come back from the dead, almost shrieking with  happiness. Lyara then turned to Sharyn, wordlessly staring into her  eyes.</p>
<p>“Do not even speak,” the lady whispered solemnly.  “Thou knowest my answer.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” she replied, kissing her softly.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Lyara didn’t really expect her fellow crewmembers to  rally behind her, so when half of them declined, there were no hard  feelings. She had to remember that, ultimately, this was <em>her</em> battle, and she was asking them to risk life and limb for no reward.  Also, most of the people who joined her were her friends, more or  less, and those that stayed behind knew they’d only be getting in  the way. Daniel would be disappointed to learn that only a dozen or  so would be coming along, but it was certainly better than nothing,  and Lyara knew from firsthand experience that most of her companions  could easily count as three or four people. Plus, they had a freaking <em>genie</em> on their side.</p>
<p>“I know just the tactic to help you out, too!” she  squealed as they made their way to “the usual place”. “It’s  so simple, I don’t know why I haven’t thought of it before! I can  just smoke everybody out and suspend them in the air until the  Capitol’s recaptured! It’s easy, it’s quick, and nobody gets  hurt.”</p>
<p>“Ever stop to think they might be wearing masks?”  Kate said.</p>
<p>“I can just loosen them. It’d be like untying a  ribbon or a zipper. Watch, I’ll show you!”</p>
<p>“No need!” Alala squeaked. “I think we can use  our imaginations!”</p>
<p>“Do it anyway,” Yenae squealed; “my imagination’s  a little fuzzy.”</p>
<p>“That’s not what you said before,” the Felinis  deadpanned. Lyara led the way quietly; she was trying not to let the  situation slow her down too much. She still found it hard to believe  she was really going to confront Asara and put an end to the  longstanding coup. It actually made her feel a little excited. Like  all fears, this one got a little easier once she actually started  facing it.</p>
<p>The “usual place” for all the Night Hammers’  secret meetings had been converted to the resistance hideout, just as  Lyara expected. This was the one place Asara had no knowledge of—  or so she hoped— the one place where loyalists could gather in  secret, and the only save haven on Avatar where they could talk  freely. A guard demanded a password, to which Lyara answered:  “Passwords are a childish anachronism, especially if the invader  kills you.”</p>
<p>“Good to have you with us, boss,” he smiled,  allowing them inside. The loyalists were nothing like the miserable  creatures roaming around Lowtown: they were strong, grave, sharp-eyed  people glowing with hope and intelligence. They stood up straight and  spoke in clear, proud voices, and just from a cursory glance, one  could tell they had good provisions, arms, supplies, and an excellent  leader directing them. Lyara had a feeling that Daniel would be  somewhere around the top of the pecking order here, but when she saw  him emerge with his old Night Hammers uniform on— a solid black  suit with a white hammer emblazoned on the back— she knew from his  posture that he was top dog. He was drastically changed from the bum  who wept on her shoulder: here was a man steadfast and wise, with his  father’s spirit and his mother’s love. He smiled at Lyara and, as  was custom for an underling, kissed her hands.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you should be doing that?” she  murmured. Everyone cheered the moment he rose up and lifted her arms,  though, and they all might have approached her to press grateful lips  on her fingers, if Daniel hadn’t rung a loud bell.</p>
<p>“Yes, brothers and sisters, the rumors are true! Our  prayers have been answered at last! Here she stands, her glory  undimmed by the passing of time, her nobility and strength still as  spectacular as they were in the old days, when Avatar was <em>civilized</em>!  Her enemies tremble at the mention of her name! Her friends rejoice!  Now, in our most desperate hour, a hero has come down to us— Lyara  Tanith!!”</p>
<p>Daniel couldn’t have went on even if he wanted: the  loyalists were cheering wildly. Lyara blushed and smiled faintly,  wishing they wouldn’t make such a fuss. She stood up and scouted  their numbers for familiar faces, and smiled lovingly as she  recognized a few.</p>
<p>“Leonard, Nicholas, it’s been a long time. Harland,  Christopher, Marshall, good to see you. Uriel, Sapphire, Mel, you’re  looking healthy. I even see some of our old rivals here. So Asara has  even brought together people who were once foes. The situation must  be serious if that has happened— but it is said that great disaster  is often the best way to unite people— and what an army we have.”  They cheered again, and she waited for them to calm down. “But you  think too well of me. I abandoned this world, searching for my own  selfish fortune, when you needed me the most. I understand that I was  too weak to do anything about it, and even though my face might not  have changed since then, I am a better person for the experiences  I’ve seen. Perhaps I went into exile so I could become stronger,  more worthier of your admiration.” They cheered again. “Yes, it  was a kind of training. And oh, the things I saw. I even found true  love.” The cheering lasted longer, and they demanded to see her  lucky lover. “That can wait another day. My arrival here was an  accident, I’ll admit that, but I swear by my own honor that I shall  not leave you again until Asara’s head hangs from the Capitol’s  highest spire, and Avatar is free once more!!”</p>
<p>Some of the more sensitive people had to hold their  ears— the yelling was that intense. When they finally calmed down,  Lyara briefly introduced her crewmembers, and summoned all the  leaders together. They explained that in the vacuum of power Lyara  left behind, Daniel was the one who became their emergent leader,  first by secluding them underground, then by slowly gathering their  strength and forming alliances with other gangs. He insisted that he  had “merely been holding the position for Lyara’s return”, and  was happy to pass the mantle onto her. He then introduced his lover,  who had worked alongside him ever since arriving.</p>
<p>“I was merely discovered by the right people,” she  chuckled. There was something distinctly familiar about her,  something feral and wild in her eyes that no amount of time or space  could take away. She had a powerful, graceful build, a hunter’s  eyes and curly blonde hair; she also had the scent of plains,  forests, and jungles on her, even in this suburban squalor. One got  the impression that she came from another age, or another world, or…</p>
<p>“Nalia?” Kate squealed. She approached the blonde  and said, “Is that you?”</p>
<p>“Sister Katherine!” she exclaimed, giving the  Heavyworlder a hug. Some of the other women nearly stumbled as they  put the pieces together: this was, in fact, the heterosexual deviant  they ran into on Amazonia, Nalia daughter of Nervasse the guard. The  reunion was exciting, but had to be cut short.</p>
<p>“The stories I have to tell!” Nalia exclaimed. “But  we can make an exchange later. I have thrown my lot in with these  good people now, for better or for worse— and with a man whom no  Amazonian could match.” She glowed warmly as she glanced at her  lover; Daniel smiled firmly and the two clasped hands.</p>
<p>“You couldn’t have found a better man in all the  universe!” Lyara said. “We really should catch up sometime— but  it is said that duty must come before desires. Daniel, how inclined  is the resistance to killing their foes?”</p>
<p>“Everyone we ever considered a friend is on our  side,” he replied grimly. “Aside from a select few that have made  their vows in fear, all of Asara’s people are our bitter enemies.”</p>
<p>“So much for your plan,” Amy murmured to Rachel.</p>
<p>“Guys, really, it’s cool!” she said. “I can  save us all so much bloodshed!”</p>
<p>“Who cares?! They need to pay for what they’ve  done!”</p>
<p>“Yes. Let them share in our suffering for once.”</p>
<p>“I like these people!” Naja laughed, but Aseria  wasn’t so amused.</p>
<p>“Y’see, this is why I don’t like most humans. Why  are they so barbaric? Do they really enjoy killing each other so  much?”</p>
<p>“Asara’s people certainly did,” they replied  gravely. Daniel and Nalia whistled for them to be quiet. Lyara was  very thankful that two prudent minds were leading this bloodthirsty  rabble.</p>
<p>“We’ll go with their plan!” he announced. “I  know how you feel, every last one of you. I know I wouldn’t mind  spilling a little of their blood as recompense. But I would not want  our own people dying as well, and if we can conquer them without a  fight, we should look to that choice first. Once Asara has fallen,  Lyara and the leaders will decide the fate of her followers. Now I  don’t want to hear anymore of this! We may come from gangs, but we  won’t sink to their level! We are better than they are!”</p>
<p>The crowd murmured in approval, but it was clear the  humility stung them. In the meantime, Lyara shared Rachel’s plan  with Daniel and Nalia, who were both surprised at its simple  ingenuity. They had tried using smoke and fumes as well, of course,  but that usually backfired, and sometimes people died. But if a  genie, who could not be killed through normal means, were the one to  strike first…</p>
<p>“The enemies in the Capitol will be taken care of  safely,” Nalia stated. “But they are only a third of Asara’s  strength. The remainder will most certainly come in from behind and  trap us. However, at least we know a frontal assault will be easy for  us. O great Djinn who serves the all-wise goddess— ”</p>
<p>“Mistress Amy, actually.”</p>
<p>“O Djinn,” she resumed, “will you aid us when our  enemy’s forces close in on us, as they surely will?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry! I just thought of a great way to  protect you from them, too! But I’m going to have to destroy a part  of the street to do it.”</p>
<p>“As long as no deaths come of it, we’re willing to  make that sacrifice.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m an Ifritah!” she winked. “Killing’s  just not my thing!”</p>
<p>“And what about Asara? How are we going to handle  her?”</p>
<p>“You won’t,” Lyara said sharply. “<em>I’m</em> going to confront her. And I’m going to get the job done. But just  in case I fail, I want the rest of you to form a perimeter around the  Capitol and block off her escape. Destroy any means of transportation  she may have and keep her quarantined inside the building. If I don’t  make it out in two hours’ time…then do with her as you will.”</p>
<p>“I’m starting to feel excited,” the loyalists  said. “Yeah, now we’ve got a fighting chance! I can’t wait for  things to go back to the way they used to be! And Lyara’s going to  lead us again! With Daniel and Nalia with her, we’ll really clean  this place up! We’ll make it respectable again! I can’t wait  anymore— let’s move out right now!”</p>
<p>“Let’s not get ahead of ourselves,” she said. “We  need to make sure the rest of the area is safe from retribution. Even  if we succeed, what will happen if her followers found out? Can I  send a few of you— ” she said to her crew, “and about twenty of  you— ” she said to the loyalists, “out to make sure everything  is safe?”</p>
<p>“If you’re concerned about the ship, we can go back  and protect her,” the Acherons said.</p>
<p>“No, the <em>Dauntless</em> will be fine on its own.  Whoever isn’t here with us is there with the ship. You’re more  useful in battle. Two heads <em>are </em>better— ”</p>
<p>“Ugh, finish that sentence and you’ll be shitting  broken glass for a week!”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she laughed. She resumed more seriously,  “At the very least, we should take an hour to make sure we’re all  prepared. Bring weapons, money, equipment, whatever you think you’ll  need. Take this time to embrace your loved ones, and once you’re  ready, move out in secret and surround the Capitol. Rachel will make  the first strike; after that, close in and let nobody leave or come  in. For freedom.”</p>
<p>“For freedom,” they repeated, as they went to work.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The de facto ruler of Avatar was a busy woman; she had  no time to regard a small family, regardless of what her subordinates  claimed. Even so, they were brought before her throne, a sniveling  trio for her to pass judgment on, charged with treason and betrayal,  among other things. The fact of the matter was that these people, and  so many others before them, were not criminals— merely middle-class  workers who were trying to get by on an increasingly lawless world—  but because they did not swear fealty to Asara’s regime, they were  branded as outcasts. Her subordinates felt it proper to at least give  them one last chance, but Asara didn’t even want to entertain that.</p>
<p>“Humor me,” she grumbled after looking them over.  The father crawled forth first.</p>
<p>“We’re just simple folks. We don’t want any  trouble.”</p>
<p>“One of my men said you wouldn’t give him any  discounts,” she murmured lazily. “Is this any way to treat your  betters? Sign a paper swearing you’ll abide by my rules and you’ll  live to see another day.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t! All of my rights, my possessions, my  stores…they’ve been taken away! This is all I have left! I’ve  lowered the prices as much as I could, but we barely have enough to  live off!”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose if one of you died, the other two  would be well off.”</p>
<p>“You can’t do that!!” he screamed, but Asara  merely gestured.</p>
<p>“Do away with him. What about that woman?” The poor  man was dragged away, kicking and fighting futilely, as his wife and  child struggled to save him. He was taken behind a door, and after  issuing one last cry, was never seen or heard from again. The woman  sobbed uncontrollably but tried to hang on, if only for her son’s  sake.</p>
<p>“Just take the store and leave us in peace! But spare  my child at least— no matter what happens to me! Please, I beg  you!”</p>
<p>“Consider it done,” she murmured, and her  underlings captured the mother and dragged her away to join her  husband. The child, barely four years old, squalled and squirmed as  his parents were stolen from him, powerless to do anything else.  Asara sighed wearily.</p>
<p>“You know, I’m really getting sick of that noise,  and he’s starting to stink. You may as well get rid of him, too.  I’ve got no time for this.” Her guards hesitated, however. This  was a line they were not sure they should cross.</p>
<p>“Um, boss, pardon me, but he’s only a child— and  he hasn’t done anything wrong. Maybe you could— ”</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, Asara stood up, threw a knife  into his chest, and shot him in the head, then sat back down with the  same metallic nonchalance. “Have I made myself perfectly clear? Get <em>rid</em> of him. And clean up that mess. It’s starting to really  reek.”</p>
<p>“Yes, boss!” they barked. Asara sighed and wished  they would stop wasting her time like that. As her men dragged the  dead body and the boy away, however, she couldn’t help but cover  her nose and wince as the foul odor intensified. Could something that  powerful come from a frightened middle-class child and a  recently-dead body? Her eyes widened in shock as she realized what it  was, and sounded the alarm.</p>
<p>“Smoke! We’re under attack again! They caught me in  a bad mood today!” Asara ran for the weapons depository, barking  commands to anyone who would listen, but the smoke was faster than  her, and it forced everyone to run outside into clearer airs. Those  that had gas masks put them on, but they were mysteriously whisked  away from their faces and thrown out windows. Asara was panicked now:  what kind of attacks were these? She heard shots being fired, but the  noise ended prematurely, which worried her. Unless those damned  turncoats were devising a very unorthodox strategy, her people would  not have won so quickly— which meant…</p>
<p>“How could they <em>lose</em> so quickly?” she  demanded. “Those traitors can’t have more people than I do! No  matter— my reserves will be here soon. I just have to hold out  until then.” She loaded herself with weapons, donning protective  clothes that could deflect knife, bullet, and fire, and dashed to the  elevator, which would guide her to the top. She called for a  helicopter to pick her up and, once everything seemed to be in order,  pressed the button. There would be no stopping her once the car door  opened.</p>
<p>But then, a ghost from the past called out to her.</p>
<p>“ASARA!! Show yourself, Asara! Come on out here and  face me! I know you’re hiding around here, Asara! Why don’t we  finish what happened four years ago? ASARAAAA!!!! Can you hear me?!”</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” she muttered to herself. But there  was no mistaking that voice: it had been the source of all of her  hatred for as long as she could remember. It was the one person—  the one creature she despised more than anything else. Finally, there  would be something worth her time.</p>
<p>“Lyara!” she brayed, drawing a dull machete (you  couldn’t relish a kill with a sharp weapon, now). “I’m over  here! Somehow I never thought you’d have the stones to come back  here! You ran away like a coward and now you’ll die like one, too!  I’m over here!”</p>
<p>The Valari turned a corner and glared at her enemy for  the first time in ages.</p>
<p>“You’ve gotten even prettier,” she muttered  darkly. “How ironic that something so beautiful can be this  sadistic. Is conquering Avatar what you had in store for the Hammers  all this time?”</p>
<p>“Not Avatar, elf bitch,” Asara giggled venomously.  The elevator suddenly opened and she slipped right in. “All of the  galaxy!” The door closed long before Lyara could reach it. She  would have to take the stairs or else wait her turn.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Incredible!” Daniel shouted as he watched Rachel  suspend his enemies in the air. “I wouldn’t believe it if I  didn’t see it myself! All right, everyone, brace yourself for the  main force! They’ll be here any minute! All squad leaders, report!”</p>
<p>“All entrances and exits have been secured, sir! The  boss went in safely, but we haven’t heard anything from her yet.”</p>
<p>“Give her time. Lyara wouldn’t disappoint us now!  What about transports?”</p>
<p>“We’ve confiscated everything we could and set fire  to the rest. The only way out is through us.”</p>
<p>“No underground passages?”</p>
<p>“None we could account for.”</p>
<p>“She can’t have made any in secret,” Daniel  muttered to himself. “What about air support?”</p>
<p>“Still no word! We’ve verified the status of the <em>Renegade</em>, though, so she won’t be going off-world. We’re  keeping our eyes open for anything else, so if she makes a run for  it, we’ll contact the <em>Dauntless</em>.”</p>
<p>“All right. Let’s wait awhile before we contact the  boss. Wouldn’t want to interrupt her!”</p>
<p>“Aye, sir!”</p>
<p>“They’re coming, love,” Nalia warned him. With  her sharp eyes, she could spot Asara’s main force from very far  away, so they had plenty of time to prepare.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot larger than I thought,” Daniel  muttered grimly. “All the same, we gotta defend this place. Hey,  Rachel! Whatever great idea you had, now’s the time to pull it  out!”</p>
<p>“I’m way ahead of ya!” she squealed. “Just  stand back and leave everything to me! Uh, seriously, you may want to  move back a bit— and hold onto something. I’m going to wait until  they’re a little closer.”</p>
<p>“Don’t work too hard!” Amy warned her. Rachel  laughed warmly, then soared into the air and started to work her  magic. Once she felt the enemies were in position, she spread her  arms out like she was evening a wrinkled shirt. The pavement  responded in kind, buckling under the magical pressure as a deep,  long canal was formed, swallowing Asara’s entire army. Rachel then  thrust her arms up, creating a wall several meters in height that  completely partitioned the army away from advancement or retreat. She  had, in effect, created an asphalt cage for them, and just to make  sure they couldn’t climb over it, she flew over the side and  pointed her fingers.</p>
<p>“Now make it slippery!” she exclaimed, and the  moisture in the air formed ice along the edges, making it impossible  to scramble a single step. Finally, she performed the <em>coup de  grace </em>and pulled their weapons out of their hands, rendering  every last one defenseless— and except for a few bruises, totally  unharmed. She laughed victoriously as they cursed at her. “Go ahead  and scramble! You won’t be getting out of there until I say so! Is  this a satisfactory revenge, Mr. Daniel?”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed!” he exclaimed, and everyone had a good  laugh as they watched their enemies slipping and sliding. Even Sharyn  giggled, though she had more pressing matters on her mind. She  sheathed her weapon and turned to the Capitol, concerned about her  lover. Being intimate with Lyara, the one person she cared about most  in this world, had almost given her a sixth sense: now she felt  psychically connected with her, and felt that her place was beside  her love.</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” she blurted, making a rush for the  entrance. “I must be at her side! Allow me through!”</p>
<p>“The boss said nobody’s to go in or out.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand!” she exclaimed  desperately. “I love her! I want to be there with her, even if it  goes against her wishes! <em>She’s calling for me!</em>”</p>
<p>“Don’t stop her if she feels that strongly!”  Nalia advised them. “No barrier can stop true love. It’s best to  just let her through.”</p>
<p>“So are you the boss’s— ” They didn’t even  get to finish their question: Sharyn burst right through, Gwen  following at her heels.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The elevator seemed to take hours getting down to her  level, but Lyara knew it would be faster than climbing the stairs.  The Capitol was the tallest building in the Pinnacle— its zenith  was literally nicknamed “the End of the World”— and scaling any  more than five or six stories would be unthinkable. But her patience  paid off, and the car came to whisk her into the heavens. Once she  stepped outside, she saw two things that somehow relieved her: one,  Asara was waiting for her in the wide clearing; and two, there were  no transports there for her, not yet at any rate. Her enemy grinned  savagely and gave her a mocking salute.</p>
<p>“I told them to delay a little just so I could see  you one last time. That’s as good as you deserve anyway, you  miserable filth!”</p>
<p>“Stop this right now, Asara!” Lyara growled. “I  know we’ve never been on good terms, but surely there’s a line  somewhere. All of Avatar is suffering! Don’t you have the least bit  of sympathy for them? For God’s sake, woman, they’re living  beings just trying to get by in life! Why would you want to increase  their hardships like that? You had a responsibility and you destroyed  it! Damn it, Asara, WHY?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you understand?!” she screamed  maliciously. “I RULE THIS WORLD!! I <em>am</em> God! I can treat  those people like bugs and nobody will raise a single hand against  me!! I can make or break any law I choose! How dare you talk to me  about fucking responsibility!? I can torch entire <em>cities </em>to  the ground if I feel like it! But even that’s not enough for me!  You were both so short-sighted all those years ago that I had to get  rid of you! Yes— I may as well come clean now! I <em>did</em> kill  our old boss, your soft-hearted surrogate father! I admit it and I’m  proud of it!! My ambitions go beyond your asinine clubhouse for Cub  Scouts! Beyond the Night Hammers! Beyond Avatar! Beyond all of the  galaxy itself! I have <em>seen</em> the face of ultimate power, Lyara,  and I’ve been promised a position of high authority in their ranks!  Can you imagine what it would be like if I had <em>all of creation</em> at my fingertips?”</p>
<p>“Hell!!” she roared in response. “It would be  Hell!” Then, suddenly, Lyara realized the full scope of what her  enemy was saying, and felt that somewhere, she had heard somebody  saying something along those same lines. “Ultimate power… Do you  mean to say you’ve joined forced with…Origin?!!”</p>
<p>“So even you know about Origin!” she exclaimed, her  eyes flashing wildly. “I’m impressed! And it looks as though you  already have your answer! All of Avatar can go up in flames for all I  care, Lyara! But Origin…ah! There’s something for me to wrap my  arms around! But I digress. My ride will be here any minute, you  know, and I’d hate to leave unfinished business behind! What say  you and I wrap up our affairs, right here at the End of the World, as  it was meant to be!!”</p>
<p>Lyara smiled grimly. “For once, we agree.” They  drew their weapons— along with her machete, Asara also had a sharp  switch that could rip apart the skin— and circled each other atop  the world’s apex. Asara attacked first, thrusting with machete,  switch, and shoulders, even snapping her teeth. Lyara only had one  weapon, an indestructible elf-sword she had brought from her  homeworld, though it offered little protection as Asara flailed at  her, lashing her fingers and her hand until it felt like she was  about to saw off the bone. She dropped the sword and picked it up  with her other hand, rolling to avoid Asara’s powerful chopping.  The machete was so heavy and dull that it wedged little marks in the  concrete roof: one blow from that would certainly kill or cripple  her, but the switch was no better. Already Lyara’s right hand was  starting to go numb from blood loss, and she could barely bend her  fingers without feeling pain. Asara kicked her hard in the ribs,  lashing at her face and spilling blood.</p>
<p>“Oh…I’ve put a mark on your pretty face! Here,  let me <em>fix it!!</em>” She lunged at Lyara, overflowing with  hatred and ambition, slapping her with the flat of her machete. Lyara  tumbled and flipped on her hands, screamed, tried to ignore the pain,  faltered, scrambled on the ground, kicked her enemy in the knee, and  swung wildly. She tore Asara’s vest and gave her chest a delicate  scar, but still had no advantage. Asara hopped on her one good leg,  wincing, her eyes burning with new fury. She dug into her jacket and  pulled out a gun, firing with deadly aim. Lyara hastily pulled  herself up and ran for cover; she waited for Asara to stop shooting  before running back out, but was kicked hard in the chest: Asara had  stopped on purpose to lure her enemy out. She swung again with the  switch, but Lyara caught it and cut it apart with her sword. Her palm  leaked red fluid, but at least her enemy had one less device.</p>
<p>No words needed to be exchanged between the two mortal  foes. Asara simply pressed the attack with her machete, to which  Lyara countered as best she could. While no device crafted by mortals  could destroy her sword, it was not particularly powerful, and she  felt herself buckling under Asara’s maddening strength. How could  any living creature hold such fury?! How far back did those seeds of  evil go? Had Asara always been this wicked? How did she know about  Origin? Of course Lyara would never have an answer; that thought  alone frustrated her. At last she felt her strength slipping, and her  stomach almost collapsed as Asara struck her with the machete. She  vomited and fell to her knees, a subject of her worst enemy’s  whims. Asara slowly lifted Lyara’s chin up with the flat of her  blade, tickling her, smiling cruelly.</p>
<p>“Oh, how long I have waited for this day!” she  whispered, a look of unmistakable joy in her eyes. “To see you  kneeling so defenselessly before me is more beautiful than anything I  could imagine! You’re nothing more than shit to me, Lyara: a  filthy, ugly, insignificant piece of pathetic bile! If only I could  make you grovel at my feet, or lick the dirt off my boots, then I  could leave this world happily! Yes, yes— I think I’ll make you  do just that! But not yet. I’ll break you first, Lyara. I’ll bite  your fingers and toes off, then I’m going to cut off your hands and  your feet and feed them to my dogs! I‘m also going to break your  kneecaps so that you‘ll never stop kneeling! I’m going to burn  your horrid ears off, and rip out your eyeballs! I’m going to put  leeches on your arms and your legs, and I’m going to pierce your  breasts with rusty nails! Then, and only then, my little piece of  shit, will I force you to slather your tongue over my boots! Get them  nice and clean, you filthy excrement! That’s the only thing you’re  good for, anyway! I may not kill you after all: I’ll just let you  fester the rest of your miserable life! Yes, that sounds nice.  Executing you wouldn’t be any fun. My ride will be here soon: then  I can get to work. Any last words?”</p>
<p>Lyara was beaten, bleeding, and disoriented, yet she  clung tightly to her senses, and managed to shift her hands so that  Asara could not see. Despite her weakness, she managed to move just  enough to accomplish her goal.</p>
<p>“Just three,” she rasped.</p>
<p>“And what are they?” she wondered. The proud elf  looked into her eyes and grinned.</p>
<p>“Made you monologue.” She took the emergency dagger  she had pulled out and thrust it deep into Asara’s throat with all  of her strength. The vile woman gurgled and choked with horror and  shock as she stepped backwards, her arms flailing, her life spewing  out before her eyes, and took one last step over the edge, where she  fell out of history and into the darkness where she belonged.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Lyara slumped and took a very deep, relieving breath.  Finally, it was over.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“You never could figure out when to shut that  god-damned mouth of yours,” she grunted. Upon further inspection of  her injuries, she concluded she would be well enough to stand in a  few minutes, providing her fingers weren’t too badly damaged. They  would probably need to be cut off, though Fuuka would no doubt give a  more hopeful diagnosis. Lyara’s insides felt awful, but the  wrenching sensation would pass. Her face stung too, but that was the  least of her problems.</p>
<p>“Damn, but what I wouldn’t give for a stiff drink,”  she muttered. She heard the stairway door opening, and thought it was  one of Asara’s people who had escaped capture. But no, this was a  sight more welcome to her than all the doctors and drinks in the  world: a green-skinned angel was coming for her, eyes overflowing  with tears, her heart aglow with love. Lyara took her into her arms  and held her, breathing in the warrior’s rich scent.</p>
<p>“S…sorry for the delay,” Sharyn whispered. She  took Lyara’s bad hand and kissed it delicately. Her lips had more  healing power in them than any anesthetic; Lyara felt like she could  wrestle an alligator now.</p>
<p>“You sure do have the worst timing,” she smiled,  nestling closer to her lover. “But better late than never. I’m  glad you were the first one I saw.”</p>
<p>“Are you well?” she whispered, dropping her courtly  speech. “Is she…”</p>
<p>“I’m okay. I just need some rest. It’s over now.”</p>
<p>“Thank God!” she whispered, weeping as their faces  rubbed together. The final dying embers of the sun’s glow faded at  last in the horizon, and all of Avatar lit up with an electric shine  that reflected in their wistful eyes. Lyara thought it a fitting end  to a long ordeal; she could finally say farewell to her past and  start anew. Sharyn kissed her scars away and pointed at the beauty  spread out before them.</p>
<p>“Look, my love! See how it glimmers?”</p>
<p>“Yes, darling,” she whispered breathlessly. “Be  it ever so humble, there’s no place like it. Not in all the  universe.”</p>
