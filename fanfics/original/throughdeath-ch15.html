<h1>Through Death Comes Life (part 15 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>      By pretty soon, Abby had been hoping for a few days... not a few hours. &quot;So much for 
having a few days,&quot; Erin said with a smile. Abby didn&#39;t look so amused. Faye was setting 
everything up as the young mother was sitting on the bed, leaning against the headboard, 
suffering from contractions.

      &quot;I&#39;m going to have a talk with Tycara when she grows up about letting people know 
before these things happen...&quot; Erin laughed nervously and looked over at Faye. &quot;Abby, I&#39;m 
afraid we have some bad news,&quot; the red head said, earning a death glare from Abby. &quot;Since 
this is a home delivery, we won&#39;t be able to offer any pain killers...&quot;

      Outside of the room, unable to hear Abby&#39;s agonized cry, Sakura fidgeted in her seat. 
Everyone was in the living room, anxious. Seth was pacing like a madman, Eveon and Mina were 
brimming with excitement, while Isaka stewed next to Krystal in jealousy... the demon only 
wished she could impregnate her lovely exorcist.

      The two goddesses told Sakura that Abby might get a bit... hostile while giving birth 
and suggested the angel wait outside. Krystal watched how tense both Seth and Sakura were 
getting so she said, &quot;How about we play some games...?&quot;

      Of course, they stupidly decided to play chess and Sakura won every time... everyone 
in the room froze when they heard a cry and a long stream of cuss words. &quot;Wow... she&#39;s so 
loud,&quot; Isaka said. Sakura couldn&#39;t take it anymore. The white haired woman got to her feet 
and walked over to the room down the hall.

      Erin and Faye were trying to keep Abby a bit calmer when Sakura came inside. Without a 
word, she pulled a chair up next to the bed and clutched one of Abby&#39;s hands. &quot;S-Sakura...&quot; 
She only gave her a small smile. The two goddesses exchanged looks but continued what they 
were doing. It was going to be a long couple of hours... 

***** 

      Eveon wasn&#39;t quite sure who the most nervous person was. It was a definite tie between 
Seth and Isaka. The young man bit his nails, shook his leg, paced and did whatever else he 
could think of to dispel his nerves. Isaka, on the other hand, was a compacted ball of 
nervous energy. Krystal tried to soothe her, but that didn&#39;t keep the demon from flinching 
and openly showing her emotions on her face.

      When it seemed like it could go on no longer, Erin came into the living room. &quot;Um... 
hey, guys, the birth went perfectly fine!&quot; It took a second before it set in. Everyone 
scrambled, hoping to be the first to see Tycara.

      Erin said, amongst the chaos, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s plenty of room so we can all go 
see Tycara together.&quot; 

***** 

      Abby stared in awe at the little bundle of joy in her arms. Tycara gurgled happily, 
reaching out to her new mother. At once, she started to shower the baby with little kisses 
and caresses, making the little girl giggle harder. Tycara was a small baby, but she had 
silver hair crowning her head and eyes to match.

      Sakura, on the other hand, just stared. She couldn&#39;t believe that Tycara... her 
daughter... was alive. She looked the same as when she&#39;d first given birth to her. Abby 
noticed the angel&#39;s reaction and held Tycara out to her.

      The baby froze for a moment. Sakura was scared that Tycara would turn away or cry 
or... or... Instead, the little girl smiled and reached out for her mother. Sakura tenderly 
took her into her arms. &quot;Ty... Tycara...&quot; Sakura murmured out before crying. Abby reached 
one hand out to console her lover.

      Faye let out a sigh, feeling a little awkward having to watch this private moment. 

***** 

      &quot;You are so cute!&quot; Mina was currently fawning over Tycara, with Eveon looking over at 
the baby. &quot;So I guess you&#39;re my little sister now!&quot; Tycara, not able to speak, could only 
coo out her happiness. Everyone was taking turns fawning over the baby, whilst Abby watched 
on in amusement. Once again, Sakura had slipped off somewhere without her noticing...

      &quot;Oh, I&#39;m going to take good care of you, Tycara,&quot; Isaka said, the next one holding the 
baby. &quot;This time around, I&#39;m going to teach you that boys aren&#39;t good at all and girls are 
so much better!&quot; Instead of laughing and smiling, Tycara proceeded to bawl and struggle in 
Isaka&#39;s arms. The demon looked entirely flustered until Seth relieved her of Tycara.

      &quot;Don&#39;t say things like that, Isaka!&quot; The young man held her carefully and Tycara 
started to calm down. The baby gripped his shirt tightly, obviously content. &quot;Um... 
Tycara... this is really touching and all, but I think this is going to be really awkward 
until you hit puberty... er, actually, until you turn 18 again,&quot; Seth murmured out, trying 
to relinquish the amorous child.

      &quot;Okay, okay, I think she needs to be fed...&quot; Abby said, taking the child away from 
Seth. &quot;F-f-fed?&quot; Seth asked nervously, &quot;In th-that case, I think I&#39;ll go... find something 
to do where I will be out of sight of something I don&#39;t want to see.&quot;

      He scurried off hurriedly, everyone else watching. There was a moment of silence until 
Eveon said, &quot;Aren&#39;t we going to leave too?&quot; Every other female in the room gave a slight 
cough and flushed bright red.

      &quot;O-oh yeah...&quot;

      &quot;Of c-course!&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not like we wanted to see that or...&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;re just curious about breastfeeding, but, um...?&quot;

      &quot;...Um, yeah, so let&#39;s go!&quot;

      Abby and Eveon let out a simultaneous sigh. &quot;I know I&#39;m twenty-something now, but 
seriously! This has got to stop!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Shh, shh... I don&#39;t know where your other mommy is, but don&#39;t cry,&quot; Abby&#39;s soothing 
words did little to relieve the crying baby in her arms. She cradled Tycara close to her 
bosom, trying to settle her down. Sakura wasn&#39;t back yet... and it was already nighttime. 
Abby wasn&#39;t sure what was going on, but she was becoming increasingly worried.

      Tycara&#39;s sniffles eventually died down and Abby wiped away her tears. &quot;Oh my... we&#39;re 
going to spoil you so badly, even if you really are a grownup in a little girl&#39;s body!&quot; The 
mother was surprised when Tycara gave a small, albeit clumsy, nod. It was hard to remember 
that it was Tycara she was holding.

      &quot;...you do look a lot like your mommy... Not me, of course, but you understand right?&quot; 
Tycara giggled and started grabbing at Abby&#39;s long hair. She wondered how much longer until 
Tycara started speaking? If Erin and Faye were right, then Tycara would grow up fast.

      Abby was startled out of her thoughts by a knock on her door. Her little bundle of joy 
clutched onto her shirt as she opened the door with one hand. On the other side was a 
bashful Krystal.

      &quot;Oh, hi Abby... um, I-I heard Tycara crying and I know you&#39;re a great mother and you 
must want to spend a lot of time with her, so maybe I&#39;ll just go-&quot; Abby cut her off.

      &quot;Yes, Krystal, you can have Tycara for the night. I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be happy.&quot; Krystal 
brightened up considerably. &quot;Really? Oh thank you...! I really love children and Tycara&#39;s so 
cute and all so...&quot; Abby gave Tycara a huge kiss on the forehead before handing her over to 
Krystal&#39;s more than capable arms. Tycara instantly clutched to Krystal&#39;s nightgown. &quot;I&#39;ll be 
sure to bring her back in the morning!&quot;

      With that, the young woman walked off, Tycara waving at her new mother. Abby went back 
into her room before lying down on the bed. Where was Sakura? Even with that troubling 
thought in mind, she slipped easily into sleep. 

***** 

      &quot;Oh, you&#39;re so cute!&quot; If a baby could die from love and praise, Tycara would probably 
be dead for a third time. Isaka and Krystal couldn&#39;t help but fawn over the little girl, for 
reasons that they couldn&#39;t even think of.

      Tycara giggled happily on the bed as she was tickled by Krystal. Isaka frowned for a 
moment, gaining the attention of her lover. &quot;What is it, Isaka?&quot; The demon let out a sigh 
before saying, &quot;I wish we could have children...&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s breath caught in her throat due to the demon&#39;s smoldering gaze. &quot;U-um, we... 
can&#39;t, but it doesn&#39;t matter. I love you so it&#39;s okay if we can&#39;t have kids, we can 
always...&quot; Her words trailed off as Isaka pinned her to a wall.

      &quot;But I think,&quot; the demon murmured, bringing her mouth very close to Krystal&#39;s ear, 
&quot;...you and I should keep trying.&quot; Krystal flushed bright red, but didn&#39;t seem too opposed 
to the idea. &quot;I-Isaka... you say the strangest th-things...&quot;

      She gave her a wolfish grin. &quot;Oh, you love it.&quot; Krystal looked rather sheepish. &quot;I-I 
know...&quot; The exorcist leaned in closer, thus starting a passionate kiss with her lover. A 
moan escaped the blonde&#39;s mouth as Isaka&#39;s hands started to tease her abdomen and-

      Unfortunately, the highly passionate couple forgot about the straight girl sitting on 
their bed, who started crying at the sight. They broke apart immediately, trying to get the 
girl to stop.

      &quot;Oh, Tycara! Don&#39;t cry, me and Isaka&#39;ll stop!&quot;

      &quot;W...we will?&quot;

      &quot;Isaka!&quot;

      &quot;Fine, fine... I&#39;ll just need something a bit... later, hmm, Krystal?&quot;

      Krystal only gave her a deadpan look. &quot;Isaka, we aren&#39;t going to have sex with Tycara 
in the room.&quot; The baby started to cry again and Isaka ground her teeth furiously, all her 
lovely plans for the night destroyed. &quot;Damn it, Tycara! Your straightness has foiled me 
again!&quot;
