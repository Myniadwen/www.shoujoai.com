<h1>Rival Rage: The Beginning of Aerolust (part 8 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Rinako rolled in the covers of her bed irritably. Last night was 
terrible. She doubted that she could ever forget that look of 
heartbreak in Keiji&#146;s eyes. Rinako never wanted to hurt him, but she 
still never said anything about commitment either. But why was she so 
against it? Keiji was a nice person, and had a lot to offer. Not to 
mention how well Rinako got on with him. But the idea of...more than 
that...

{God...why do I keep hurting people?} Rinako thought. {First Minato, 
then Mishizu, now Keiji...is it all down to...her...?}

Rinako scowled when thoughts of &#145;That Woman&#146; came to mind. Her very 
name set Rinako off in a flood of anger. Memories of two years ago 
came back with raw force as well. And as long as those hurt feelings 
were there, Rinako couldn&#146;t move on with her life. 

The question was, did Rinako realize that she didn&#146;t want to move on? 

A tired growl came from the young martial artist when the alarm clock 
went off. Classes would be starting soon. Not like Rinako could be 
bothered with them at this point. But then, if she was late or if she 
skipped them, that would mean another weekend detention. That was the 
last thing she needed. 

Rinako slowly pulled out of her covers and looked across at Minato&#146;s 
bed. Just like yesterday, Minato had left early. Not because she 
wanted to get to classes on time, but because she wanted to avoid 
Rinako. And Rinako didn&#146;t much blame her. But regardless, she was 
still firm about keeping Natsumi away from her sister. And Rinako 
would do that without fail. 

Rather than dwell on those problems, Rinako went over to her wardrobe 
and put on her normal auburn school uniform. Her hands flicked over to 
her nightstand to grab her books, then a noise across the room caught 
her attention. 

&#147;What the?&#148;

It was a note. Someone had slipped it under the door. Rinako quickly 
picked it up and opened the door to see who dropped it there. Nobody 
was out there. But instead of worrying about it, she opened up the 
small slip, and began reading it aloud. 

&#147;We need to talk...meet me at the southern gates at 12.50 today. I&#146;ll 
be waiting for you.&#148;

Rinako scrunched up the note in anger. &#147;I knew it! It&#146;s that damn 
Yakume girl trying it on with Minato again. Too bad she didn&#146;t do her 
homework when she decided to mess with me.&#148;

After grabbing her books, Rinako stuffed the note into her pocket and 
headed out to her first class of the day. Natsumi may have planned to 
see one Ikatsuji sister, but she was going to meet the other. 

**********

&#147;Alright, Yakume. Come on out, I know what you&#146;re up to.&#148;

Rinako eyeballed this area for Natsumi. The southern gates were just a 
nickname for an isolated section of the school. It was nestled between 
the humanities department and the school gyms, but had enough space 
for more than ten people to hang around in. It was also a neutral 
territory that belonged to no specific gang, which meant many people 
came through this place. But mostly at night. Which made a note for a 
meeting here during the daytime a little peculiar. But Rinako had a 
good hunch on the person who put that note under her door.  

And so, Rinako waited for her to show herself. &#147;I can wait all day, 
Yakume.&#148;

However, the voice that responded was not Natsumi&#146;s. &#147;I am glad you 
came.&#148;

Instantly, Rinako&#146;s body shot around to look behind her. She knew that 
voice clearer than anyone she had ever heard before. And her 
suspicious were not unfounded. Sure enough, it was Ayane.

&#147;You!?&#148; Rinako yelled. &#147;What the hell do you want?&#148;

Ayane stepped forward from the shadows of the left Gym building. 
Everything seemed normal about her, but Rinako could tell that 
something was a little different. Something she couldn&#146;t quite place.

Ayane&#146;s gold eyes were a little more intense than usual. &#147;We need to 
talk, Rinako. You cannot run from this any longer than you have.&#148;

Rinako&#146;s honey brown eyes narrowed. &#147;You&#146;re the one who sent the 
note...aren&#146;t you? Why did you call me here?&#148;

Ayane struggled to get this out. Never was she comfortable with 
expressing herself in these sorts of issues. But this had to be said. 
It was eating away at her and creating a void that needed to be filled 
before it consumed her. At all costs.

&#147;Rinako...&#148; Ayane began. &#147;I...I cannot keep fighting you...not like 
this...I cannot.&#148;

Rinako was oblivious to the effort Ayane was making. &#147;Oh yeah? So 
you&#146;re just gonna back down like the spineless coward you are? I 
understand. You&#146;re pathetic, Ayane.&#148;

The SBA leader&#146;s head lowered. &#147;Maybe that is true.&#148;

&#147;Do you want pity from me?&#148; Rinako asked derisively. &#147;You&#146;ve got some 
front, Yosukube. You sicken me.&#148;

Ayane desperately tried not to take Rinako&#146;s words to heart. &#147;I know 
you do not mean that.&#148;

Regardless of her scorn, Rinako&#146;s soul wavered. &#147;The hell I don&#146;t.&#148;

Slowly, Ayane&#146;s eyes climbed back up to look at Rinako. And Ayane took 
that instance to peer within her equal. In those searing brown eyes of 
Rinako&#146;s...so much hate, so much anger. And she had caused it all. It 
broke Ayane&#146;s heart to know that Rinako&#146;s unhappiness was down to her. 

&#147;Rinako...&#148; Ayane began. &#147;Please do not let it end like this...&#148;

The moment she heard that, Rinako looked away, her soul screaming out 
the realities to her. This was what it was all about. The rivalry, the 
hatred, the fighting. They were all branches of a tree that had 
sprouted two years ago. And if things were allowed to continue the way 
they had been, that tree would wither and die. Ayane was beginning to 
realize this, but Rinako&#146;s attitude indicated that she was not 
prepared to do something about it. 

The hurt feelings from two years ago were making an unscheduled 
comeback in Rinako&#146;s heart. &#147;Why shouldn&#146;t I? It...it never meant 
anything to me...why should I care about the past?&#148; 

Just then, Ayane felt something snap inside her. Even though Rinako 
had every right to be angry if you took it from her perspective, she 
was not the only victim here. Ayane charged over to a resentful 
Rinako, grabbing her by the arms, and staring firmly into her eyes. 

&#147;You cannot just ignore this, Rinako! I will not let you throw this 
away because you are too proud to face up to it!&#148;

Rinako scowled. What right did *she* have to be angry? &#147;Get away from 
me, Ayane! How dare you make out that this is your option!?&#148; Are you 
forgetting that I hate you? That you hate me? 

Ayane&#146;s anger subsided and her grip loosened slightly. &#147;...No.&#148;

&#147;So why won&#146;t you go away, or swing a punch?&#148; 

If ever Ayane made a resolution within herself, then this had to be 
the one that counted. &#147;Because...I...I want...&#148;

&#147;You want what?&#148; Rinako asked harshly.

As much as she struggled to get this out, Ayane was deathly serious 
about it. &#147;I...I want us...to try again.&#148;

Rinako was stunned into silence. But her shocked mind then started to 
loose focus and her bruised heart took the fold. &#147;...Why...?&#148;

Ayane could tell that she was starting to get through to Rinako. But 
she still had yet to learn of the whole truth. Not only that, but 
Ayane had to be honest with herself. Not just for herself but for the 
Spring Breeze Assassins. There was no way the white-haired fighter 
could lead the SBA with a wavering heart. 

Ayane breathed hard as she said this statement for the first time in 
two whole years. &#147;I still...love you, Rinako.&#148;

Rinako could say nothing. Nothing that was worthwhile, her voice was 
lost to her. Ayane still loved her... &#147;...&#148;  

Rinako&#146;s stillness was taken by Ayane as indecision. Something more 
was needed to show how serious she was. &#147;I heard about Keiji giving 
you a ring, so...I...&#148;

A low sounding chuckle came from Rinako upon hearing that. Ayane was 
confused, but Rinako felt like everything was that much clearer. 

&#147;Oh, I get it.&#148; Rinako said seething. &#147;You don&#146;t want me, but you 
don&#146;t want anyone else to have me. You don&#146;t give a damn about us, you 
just wanna make sure that Keiji doesn&#146;t tread on your old property...&#148;

Ayane was shocked. How could Rinako say that? &#147;...Rinako please, I am 
really-&#147;

Rinako pushed away Ayane&#146;s grip, her eyes shut and with a mildly 
disappointed frown on her face. &#147;Go away, Ayane...&#148;

The Yosukube girl held firm. &#147;No.&#148;

&#147;I said get los-&#147;

Rinako&#146;s loud demand was cut short by the sweet kiss of Ayane. With no 
need for a second ushering, Ayane pushed her soft pink lips up against 
Rinako&#146;s. The russet eyes of the older Ikatsuji sister went wide with 
surprise. Briefly she attempted to fight against it, but quickly that 
hesitation dissolved. Through all the fighting and hatred that had 
gone on between Rinako and Ayane for the past two years, that carnal 
passion of the past had yet to die. And although it wasn&#146;t obvious, 
that attraction was even stronger when they were fighting one and 
other. Rinako could not count the amount of times she had lost her 
concentration during a fight from seeing a flash of Ayane&#146;s thighs. 
Rinako&#146;s mind was screaming &#145;don&#146;t let her do this to you again&#146; while 
her heart and body were burning for Ayane. With a relaxed sigh, Rinako 
placed both of her palms against Ayane&#146;s chest, and thoughtlessly 
returned her kiss. 

As Rinako&#146;s resistance left her, Ayane lost her own misgivings, and 
dared to embrace Rinako with her arms. Unfortunately, it was then that 
Rinako regained her senses. As soon as she felt Ayane&#146;s hands run down 
the small of her back, Rinako awkwardly broke their kiss and breathed 
in deeply.

{What am I doing?} Thought Rinako. {Why am I still attracted to her?}

Without out warning, Rinako swung her evened out palm towards Ayane&#146;s 
cheek and slapped her sharply. The gold-eyed girl released Rinako as 
she stumbled back, and held a hand to her already reddening cheek. But 
as Ayane looked up, she was surprised to see fragile tears leaking 
from her eyes. She was crying.

&#147;Don&#146;t you dare kiss me like that, Ayane!&#148; Rinako screamed, her voice 
already breaking. &#147;You gave that up a long time ago, remember? So just 
do me a favour and stay away from me!&#148;

Rinako quickly ran off, wiping her eyes as she ran. Leaving Ayane 
behind. She was shocked, to say even the least. Rinako had slapped 
her. But that in itself was not the shocking thing. She was a martial 
artist. Rinako could have done anything to push Ayane, but she instead 
slapped her. That wasn&#146;t the act of a school gang leader or a martial 
artist. 

It was the act of a vulnerable woman. 

And from that, Ayane realized the truth. Rinako still loved her. 

**********

Five minutes later, back in her dorm, Minato crashed on her bed. Her 
last class was Maths, and since a test was coming up next week, she 
had to work that much harder. However it was clear that Minato could 
not concentrate. Not while Natsumi was denied to her. Even so, Minato 
had English to look forward to. That was the one lesson she shared 
with Natsumi. Despite the fact that they wouldn&#146;t even be able to talk 
to each other, Minato was just happy to see her. 

Just then a dazed and oddly pale Rinako stepped into the dorm room. 
Minato was trying hard to ignore her sister but she couldn&#146;t avoid 
that haunted look that Rinako was wearing. 

&#147;Rinako?&#148; Minato concern was apparent, but her voice was still firm, 
not willing to let Rinako believe that they were getting past the 
Natsumi situation. &#147;Are you okay?&#148;

Rinako wordlessly slumped down on her bed and let her ailing head rest 
in her hands. 

Minato nudged again. &#147;Rinako?&#148;

That got through to her. &#147;...M-Minato? Oh...I&#146;m sorry...&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry about it.&#148; Minato stood up from her bed, grasping her 
textbooks. &#147;I&#146;ll see you later.&#148;

Rinako pulled out of her stupor just as Minato placed her hand on the 
doorknob. &#147;Where are you going, Minato?&#148;

The blonde sighed. She knew this was coming. &#147;I&#146;m going to get 
something to eat. It is lunchtime, unless you&#146;ve forgotten that.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m warning you not to see that girl.&#148; Rinako said, her thoughts 
drifting away from Ayane for a short time. 

Minato scowled. &#147;Since when has my love life been any of your concern, 
Rinako? Whomever I see or date is none of your business!&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re my sister! What do you mean this is none of my business?&#148; 
Rinako enquired angrily. 

&#147;You heard me.&#148;

Rinako stood up, in no mood to chat idly. &#147;Look, Minato. I&#146;m not 
asking you not to see her, I&#146;m *telling* you that you can&#146;t see her!&#148;

Minato&#146;s eyes narrowed out. Rinako was addressing her like she was 
some lovesick child. &#147;Excuse me? Who do you think you are? You&#146;re not 
Mom, Rinako!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m just trying to look out for you!&#148;

Minato looked away from her sister. &#147;No you&#146;re not, you&#146;re trying to 
control me. You don&#146;t have a say in the matter! I&#146;m going to continue 
dating Natsumi with or without your approval!&#148;

To confirm the seriousness of her declaration, Minato slammed the door 
behind her as she left. 

&#147;Minato!&#148; Rinako yelled. But it was too late, she was already gone. 
And Rinako didn&#146;t have the heart to follow her. Everything was going 
wrong for her. Even though she had other classes after lunch, Rinako 
was in no mood to take part in them. Just like before, she needed time 
to herself to think this through. Rinako rustled through her wardrobe 
and gathered up her fighting Gi. If she was going to clear her mind 
then it was natural to do it through training. 

**********

&#147;Yaah!&#148;

With brilliant skill and precision, Ayane&#146;s steel-smashing fist 
crushed two neatly stacked cinder blocks. The girl crouched down as 
her motion came to an end. Much like a certain someone, Ayane felt a 
certain peace while training. And right now she needed it. The Rai 
shou en ken fighter was clad in her school uniform, and was within the 
training halls outside of the school. Just like when she discovered 
the existence of Keiji Aoba, Ayane came her to sort out her feelings. 

Her feelings toward Rinako and her feelings about herself. 

&#147;Why can she not see?&#148; Ayane mumbled to herself. &#147;Why does she not 
understand? Why does she push me away?&#148;

As Ayane debated this profusely, her inner voice, the voice of Rai 
shou en ken, called out to her. In a parallel but exact replica of her 
own voice. 

{Can you blame her?} The voice said. 

Ayane realized that her soul was calling out to her. &#147;I just want to 
be with her. I cannot take any of this constant fighting any more.&#148;

{This is your doing. You cannot blame her for feeling the way she 
does. You made the choice, Ayane. Not Rinako.} 

&#147;I was only doing what I thought was best for her!&#148;

{Does she know that?}

Ayane fell silent. &#147;...&#148;

{Let her know the truth. She deserves to know.}

&#147;Why should I even bother? Even if she does still love me...her pride 
will not let her admit it.&#148; 

{How will you know that for sure if you let it go?}

&#147;Why should I bother to fight for her if she will not do the same?&#148;

{Because Rinako is blinded by her own hurt feelings. You cannot blame 
her for that. It was not her fault. This is all down to your wishes. 
But you can change things if you want to.}

&#147;...What should I do...? What should I do?&#148;

{Rinako loves you. But you must take the first step. If you let your 
love for her die, then you will be losing a piece of yourself that you 
will never be able to regain. Go to her. Try just one last time.}  

&#147;But...will she...?&#148;

{Do you love her?}

&#147;Yes...of course I do. I never stopped.&#148;

{Then go to her and tell her so. Win her love back.}

**********

Rinako kicked and punched the heavy bag within her private training 
area. The exact same position she was in before her argument with 
Mishizu. Rinako had to wonder how she was doing. She hadn&#146;t seen or 
spoken to Mishizu since then. Then there was her Minato problem. 
Keeping her sister away from Natsumi. And then there was Ayane...

Rinako&#146;s leg slammed against the heavy bag, those thoughts of Ayane 
spreading anger into her again. Yet still, she felt a wave of warmth 
envelop her when she remembered Ayane&#146;s kiss...

Rinako clutched her head. &#147;What is wrong with me? Why can&#146;t I just let 
go of that! Why can&#146;t I just...damn her! Damn that bitch to hell...&#148;

Just as it had done for Ayane, Rinako&#146;s soul, influenced by the Rai 
shou en ken, called out to her. 

{That&#39;s not a smart idea. Considering that fact that you&#39;d just throw 
yourself into the flames to get her back...}

&#147;What?!&#148;

{Don&#39;t play dumb, Rinako. You can&#39;t lie to your soul.}

&#147;I...&#148;

{You still...}

&#147;No!&#148;

{You still...love her, don&#39;t you?}

&#147;I never loved Ayane.&#148;

{So why are you crying?}

&#147;...I...hate her...I always have...I always will...&#148;

{Do you really?}

&#147;Of course I do! I&#39;ll never forgive her for-&#147;

{For breaking your heart?}

&#147;I don&#39;t care for her!&#148;

{Oh yes you do. You&#39;ve never stopped, and you never will stop.} 

&#147;...Stop it...&#148;

{Every time you see her your heart burns, doesn&#39;t it? Every time you 
kissed Keiji all you thought about was her. The first time you met, 
danced, kissed...made love.}

&#147;I said stop it!&#148;

{Admit it. Keiji was never a choice, just a substitute. You picked a 
decent guy because you were afraid of loving, then having your heart 
get torn again. But you could never replace Ayane. You&#39;ll never stop 
loving her.}

&#147;...She...she hurt me, so much...&#148;

{Don&#39;t you think she&#39;s hurting too?}

&#147;...How can I just get over-&#147;

{You can&#39;t. It will was always be there. You can&#39;t change that fact. 
Neither can Ayane. But you owe it to yourself to be honest, at least. 
You deserve to live a live without that kind of pain.}

&#147;To be...honest...?&#148;

**********

Later that day, after classes, at around 12.00 at night, Ayane snuck 
out of her dorm room and crossed the courtyard over to the 2nd dorm 
blocks. Or more specifically, the Cross Blade Lancer blocks. Even 
though it was risky and a little foolish to enter that area, 
especially considering whom she was. But Ayane was not going to let 
this go. Not now. She had to get her Rinako back. 

After walking up to the doors of the east dorms blocks, Ayane opened 
the door and stepped through. It was quiet, all the lights had been 
turned off and most of the students were asleep. Except for one. Who 
was sitting by the front door, on a chair, obviously on her turn as a 
lookout. It was Mishizu. 

Mishizu looked up at a bold Ayane from her seat. &#147;Yosukube? What are 
you doing here?&#148;

&#147;I am here to speak with Rinako.&#148; Ayane said simply. 

Mishizu was incredulous. &#147;Are you insane? Do you really believe that 
you can just walk in here and do as you please?&#148;

&#147;I am not here for a fight.&#148; Ayane said. &#147;I want to speak to Rinako, 
that is all.&#148;

Mishizu&#146;s diamond eyes thinned out. &#147;Speak to her about what?&#148;

&#147;A personal matter. A matter that does not concern you.&#148;

Mishizu looked downwards. She knew exactly what was going on here. 
Even though Rinako was afraid to admit it, Mishizu knew her very well. 
And she knew that her distaste for Ayane stemmed from something that 
was important to her. After a lot of though on that, Mishizu had 
realized long ago that there might have been something between Rinako 
and Ayane. Which was another reason why Mishizu disliked Rinako&#146;s 
relationship with Keiji. It was unfair to use him as a distraction 
from another. But then, maybe Mishizu was preoccupied with her own 
affections towards Rinako...

&#147;Tell me what you are going to say to Rinako.&#148; Mishizu ordered. 

Ayane frowned curiously at her. &#147;I fail to see how this is any of your 
concern.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m making it my concern!&#148; Mishizu yelled. &#147;You&#146;re not the only one 
that...&#148;

&#147;That what?&#148; Ayane was confused, but then she thought about it. Then 
it hit her. &#147;Are you in love with-&#147;

Mishizu cut her off. &#147;I don&#146;t know...I think I do. But she doesn&#146;t 
know anything. Not about how I feel.&#148;

Ayane was disbelieving. It was well known that Mishizu had a defensive 
hold on Rinako. But Ayane never interpreted it as love. It was fairly 
obvious now, but...that wasn&#146;t what was concerning Ayane at this 
point.

&#147;You knew all along.&#148; The white-haired girl said. &#147;Did you not?&#148;

&#147;It was fairly obvious. Rinako was never serious about Keiji.&#148;

&#147;I see...&#148; Ayane trailed off.

Though this was hard to say, some things were more important to her 
then her own feelings. &#147;If...if I let you go through, will you try to 
resolve with her?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

Mishizu continued. &#147;And you think that will make her happy?&#148;

&#147;I know it will.&#148; That was said with true confidence. 

Mishizu looked away once more. &#147;...Then go.&#148;

That was a brave move. Even Ayane realized that. It took great courage 
to choose someone else&#146;s happiness over your own. Never had Ayane 
expected this to come from Mishizu. 

&#147;Thank you...Mishizu.&#148;

&#147;I am not doing this for you.&#148; Mishizu said that quite firmly. &#147;I&#146;m 
doing this for Rinako. I cannot stand to see her suffer anymore than 
she has. Now talk to her if that is what you want.&#148;

Ayane nodded, then walked off towards Rinako&#146;s room. Somehow she got 
the feeling that Mishizu was owed a debt at some point. Even if they 
were enemies. Following a short walk, Ayane stood before the door to 
Rinako&#146;s room. Instead of knocking, the Spring Breeze Assassin opened 
to the door and walked inside.

Across from Ayane, on her mildly woven bed, was the beautiful Rinako 
Ikatsuji, dressed only in her thin nightdress, with the most heavenly 
of expressions on her face. But she was awake.  

And more than surprised to see the SBA leader. &#147;...Ayane...?&#148;

This was going to be hard. &#147;...Rinako...&#148;

Though she had been thinking about this all day, when Ayane finally 
got to do this, she didn&#146;t know how to act. However, Rinako took the 
initiative and acted on her behalf. The amethyst-haired women stood 
from the bed she was sitting on, and walked over to Ayane.

They were face to face.

&#147;...Ayane...&#148; Rinako was having as much trouble as Ayane was. 

Then Ayane decided on an easier way, but was curious about one thing.  
&#147;Where is your sister?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s sleeping in Mishizu&#146;s room.&#148; Rinako said. &#147;I get the feeling 
she doesn&#146;t want to see me right now.&#148;

Good. At least they could be alone for this. &#147;Rinako...about what 
happened...back then...&#148;

Rinako shook her head, and silenced Ayane with that gentle request. 
Some things were a little more important than the regrets you&#146;ve had 
about the past. Rinako was beginning to realize this. Her soft brown 
eyes looked up into Ayane&#146;s deep gold ones, and let a solitary hand 
run through her short tresses of untainted white hair. 

&#147;Don&#146;t.&#148; Rinako said, her voice barely a whisper. &#147;That&#146;s...not what I 
need from you right now...can you please...just hold me?&#148;

Before Rinako knew it, strong arms were enfolding her, and for the 
first time in over two years, Rinako felt safe. Safe and protected 
within Ayane&#146;s embrace. And Rinako finally had the courage to admit 
that she still loved her. The two looked into each other&#146;s eyes again. 
No hatred, no anger, no challenges. Just what they felt for each 
other. A sigh was heaved as their lips closed in on each other, and a 
phantom of hate was lifted from Rinako as they kissed. 

Rinako at last had her angel back.

Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts
----------------------

* They&#146;re finally together again! But poor old Mishizu and Keiji...oh 
well; Mishizu at least will not be alone forever. But...there are more 
important things to worry about...like why is the Shunshibaru crystal 
reacting to Rinako! All questions will be answered in the next chapter 
of Rival Rage!

* Sorry this update took so long, RR fans. I&#146;m going to devote a whole 
week to finishing this story. I swear that more chapters will be 
coming soon. 

* I&#146;ve just noticed this, but there are a lot of things going on in 
Rival Rage. A lot of characters and information that is easy to 
forget. I have written up a sort of FAQ for this story, with character 
profiles and information and such. If anybody wants to see this, just 
drop me an e-mail and I&#146;ll send it straight over to you.
