<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 9 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>      &quot;Do you always come out here?&quot; Erin perked up at the question. She was currently 
sitting down next  to a... river...? She wasn&#39;t sure, but a woman was standing next to 
her... that same woman from the other dream.

      &quot;I guess...&quot; Erin answered, not really sure what was going on. The woman sat down next 
to her, but Erin said nothing. What was going on? This had to be the strangest and yet most 
boring dream she&#39;d ever had...

      &quot;...aren&#39;t you going to say anything?&quot; The woman asked and Erin just gave her a 
strange look. &quot;Um... no...?&quot; Once again, her mystery dream woman seemed pissed. &quot;Why do you 
always have to be like that?&quot;

      Erin tried not to cringe. Since when did dreams verbally abuse you? &quot;...there&#39;s 
nothing wrong with just enjoying silence, is there?&quot; The woman, quite predictably, let out a 
huff. &quot;I will never understand you. Anybody else would be delighted to be in my presence.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry... then why don&#39;t you go talk to someone else?&quot; Erin asked softly. However, 
the woman took it the wrong way.

      &quot;You&#39;re so eternally frustrating! I don&#39;t understand you; why do you have to be like 
this?&quot;

      &quot;I... don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot;

      &quot;Stop it! You&#39;re just playing games with me, but I&#39;m the one who is supposed to be in 
control. Why is it you? Why can&#39;t you just...?&quot; She let out a frustrated sound and left in a 
hurry. Erin just sat there, wondering why her dreams had become so weird. Maybe she should 
blame it on the snake goddess, but that was just her new scapegoat... 

***** 

      Before she could think anymore on it, Erin started to awake on the couch. She let out 
a groan and sat up. She was half hoping that everything that had happened to her in the last 
two days was just a dream, but she got up in time to see Eveon and Mina going up the stairs, 
cutely holding each other&#39;s hands.

      It wasn&#39;t a dream. She resisted the urge to let out a groan, but the headache she was 
suffering from was making it quite difficult. &quot;You know, it&#39;s not good for you to drink like 
that...&quot; Erin looked up to see that it was Krystal who had spoken, her eyes reflecting 
worry. Isaka was standing right next to her idly staring at a wall.

      &quot;I... keep having strange dreams... and I feel funny...&quot; Erin muttered out. She sat 
up, got light headed and plopped back down.

      &quot;...and that&#39;s why you don&#39;t drink &#39;til you&#39;re 21,&quot; Isaka said and looked over at 
Krystal. &quot;We should help her upstairs...&quot;

      The blonde woman nodded and leaned down to pick up Erin. The 18 year old tried to get 
up and only collapsed into the exorcist. &quot;I-I don&#39;t feel funny because of the alcohol... 
and... Krystal... you&#39;re so warm...&quot;

      Since she had her face buried in Krystal&#39;s bosom, Erin couldn&#39;t see the death glare 
Isaka was giving her for being intimately draped over her girlfriend. Krystal smiled 
sheepishly at the demon. &quot;Isaka, could you carry her?&quot;

      The demon pursed her lips, but obliged. As Erin rested comfortably in Isaka&#39;s arms, 
Krystal looked worried. &quot;She didn&#39;t really drink that much. Two glasses? I&#39;ve heard of light 
weights, but this is ridiculous.&quot;

      The demon shrugged. &quot;She said it wasn&#39;t because of the alcohol so...&quot; The two loves 
exchanged knowing glances. &quot;The goddess...&quot; Krystal said, less as a question and more of a 
statement.

      &quot;You told Seth and Tycara about the plan, right?&quot; Krystal nodded at Isaka&#39;s question. 
&quot;Then they don&#39;t have any qualms?&quot;

      The exorcist shook her head. &quot;No, they both said that it was the best way to deal with 
the situation... Seth also said that strange things should start happening to Erin.&quot; Both of 
them looked down at the teenager who seemed to be half-conscious.

      &quot;Like getting drunk really easily?&quot; The demon asked, a little confused. Krystal 
giggled and shook her head. &quot;No, he said that traditionally, when the vessel becomes self 
aware, a stronger bond is establish between them and the spirit of the god. So, he said that 
Erin should be feeling... um, the power of the goddess or something like that. He just said 
to watch out for weird things.&quot;

      As if on cue, Erin spoke up. &quot;See? It... isn&#39;t the alcohol...&quot; Isaka just let out a 
sigh as they reached Erin&#39;s room. &quot;Alright then... so what&#39;s been happening to you?&quot; She 
asked as Krystal opened the door for her.

      &quot;...lots of funny dreams with a stuck up lady... she&#39;s not very nice and she&#39;s kind of 
a brat.&quot; The two lovers exchanged looks again. They had no clue what that was supposed to 
mean...

      &quot;Hmm...&quot; Erin let out a happy sound as Isaka tenderly laid her in bed. Krystal started 
to go through some of the extra clothes Abby had left in the room, trying to find something 
to put on Erin. &quot;...where&#39;s Posh-Posh...?&quot;

      Both Isaka and Krystal jerked in surprise. They hadn&#39;t seen the snake in a while 
because it was with Erin so... &quot;Oh great...&quot; Isaka murmured and Krystal ruffled her hair. 
They should have known the first time that snake showed up.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, I&#39;m sure it or he or whatever is doing fine,&quot; Isaka said 
helping her sit up. It seemed Erin had gone to sleep... She awkwardly removed the girl&#39;s 
shirt as Krystal came over with a devious look on her face. &quot;If I was any other girl, I 
would think you were taking advantage of poor Erin.&quot;

      The demon scoffed. &quot;Please. She&#39;s very beautiful, but she&#39;s not you...&quot; Krystal sat 
down next to her on the bed and gave her a small kiss. The exorcist reached over to Erin and 
removed her pants.

      &quot;Who&#39;s taking advantage of who?&quot; Isaka snorted, giving her girlfriend a knowing look. 
Krystal just laughed and said, &quot;Don&#39;t be like that... I promise when we get back to our 
room, I&#39;ll take care of you.&quot;

      She tenderly cupped the demon&#39;s cheek and Isaka placed a hand over Krystal&#39;s. They 
both leaned in and kissed passionately.

      At that moment, they completely forgot that Erin was half dressed on the bed, 
practically passed out. Of course, Erin&#39;s eyes fluttered open and she sat up. She had fallen 
asleep for a few moments and had been so out of it when Isaka carried her upstairs.

      So, imagine her surprise to find herself lying on the half naked next to two lesbians 
making out on the edge of her bed. That was definitely something she didn&#39;t need to wake up 
to. Erin let out shrill scream and tried to cover her state of undress. Krystal and Isaka 
realized just then what it must look like to the poor teenager.

      &quot;Erin! No, it&#39;s not like that,&quot; Krystal stuttered out, trying to calm down the girl.

      &quot;D-d-d-d-did I really drink that much? I-I thought she just carried up to bed - I 
didn&#39;t think this was going to happen!&quot; Erin wailed out.

      &quot;We did just carry you up and you passed out, so we were going to change your 
clothes,&quot; Isaka said, but then realized the look on Erin&#39;s face indicated that she did not 
believe the demon.

      &quot;You two are crazy! I thought you were having sex problems, but come on!&quot;

      Krystal grabbed her by the shoulders when she tried to get off the bed, while Isaka 
picked up the extra shirt for Erin. &quot;Look,&quot; the demon said, her face flushed in 
embarrassment. &quot;We weren&#39;t going to have a... you know with you - we were seriously just 
going to put some clean clothes on you...&quot;

      Erin started to calm down and this time Krystal spoke. &quot;It was really inappropriate 
for us to kiss like that, but you&#39;re still disillusioned from waking up...&quot; By now, Erin had 
relaxed... at least somewhat. Her face was bright red in embarrassment, but Krystal just 
gave her a kind smile. &quot;You&#39;ve had a rough day, so let us help you.&quot;

      Just as Erin was about to question what kind of &#39;help&#39; they were offering, Isaka took 
one her arms and began to help her into her shirt. Krystal eased in the other arm and pulled 
it down over Erin&#39;s head. At that moment, Erin was sitting on the bed between Krystal and 
Isaka, with the shirt not yet down over her chest.

      Krystal had her hand on Erin&#39;s shoulder and the other was pulling her hair out over 
the shirt. Isaka, on the other hand, was holding the hem of the shirt and her other hand was 
on Erin&#39;s waist. Regardless of their intentions, the brunette felt she could die from 
embarrassment, her lethargy almost gone thanks to the shock of waking up just a few minutes 
earlier.

      &quot;Man, Erin, if you scream one more time-&quot; All three girls suffered whiplash as they 
turned to the now opening door. As if the night couldn&#39;t get anymore awkward, Abby walked 
in, apparently still suffering from a headache and still wearing a skimpy outfit. The young 
mother froze. And stared. And her eye started to twitch uncontrollably.

      &quot;What... the... hell...?&quot; She murmured as all the three girls tried to think of 
something cohesive to say. &quot;Erin! I-I don&#39;t believe this! Is EVERYONE a lesbian? Seriously, 
you and I were supposed to be single...! And I find you in a threeway with my second 
favorite lesbian couple?!&quot;

      The brunette just gaped at her. &quot;Uh, um, I-I&#39;m sorry?&quot;

      Abby took a step into the room, prepared to stop whatever they were doing, but then 
froze. &quot;On second thought, maybe I shouldn&#39;t go into the room. Last thing I want is to get 
converted and this thing to escalate to a foursome... since not only is Erin a secret 
lesbian now a part of this little lesbian trifecta, I&#39;m apparently a total MILF and the last 
thing I want is to get jumped by you guys...!&quot; She practically shouted the last part and let 
out a long sigh.

      With that, she turned around and shut the door, leaving the three girls confused and 
extremely embarrassed. &quot;That&#39;s two in one night...&quot; Krystal groaned out and Isaka sighed. 
&quot;Yeah, three strikes and we&#39;re out, ne?&quot;

      &quot;Um, can I put some clothes on, now?&quot; Erin asked, looking like she wanted to go dig a 
hole and hide in it.

      Isaka and Krystal exchanged devious glances. Sure, it wasn&#39;t a nice joke, but... &quot;What 
if we said no?&quot; The demon asked seductively, splaying one hand across Erin&#39;s taut abdomen. 
She stared wide eyed before giving Krystal a pleading look. The blonde woman just smiled and 
caressed her cheek. &quot;You are very beautiful, Erin,&quot; said the exorcist, allowing the words to 
come out with husky tone.

      The two lovers looked at each other and laughed. &quot;It would be a good stress relief for 
her, right Isaka?&quot; The demon chuckled and let one hand play with Erin&#39;s hair. &quot;Yes, it 
would... plus, I&#39;ve always been curious about indulging in such an activity with three 
people.&quot;

      For the unfortunate Erin, she let out a sound akin to a startled gasp before her eyes 
rolled to the back of her head and she went limp. The lovers caught her and tried not to 
laugh.

      &quot;Was that a little too mean, Isaka? She&#39;s been through so much lately and we&#39;re just 
making it worse...&quot;

      &quot;Meh, it&#39;s all fun and games...&quot; The demon then gave Krystal a pondering look, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know about you, but I was only half joking.&quot;

      The exorcist decided that it would be best if they dressed Erin now before temptation 
and curiosity decided to bite them in the butt later. 

***** 

      Speaking of temptation, &quot;Oh... Mi...na...&quot; Eveon groaned out, &quot;That feels... so... 
nice...!&quot; The other girl just giggled. &quot;I knew it would. You just have to learn to relax and 
let my capable hands take care of you.&quot;

      While a person listening in would believe it to be quite sexual (which is what Abby 
was doing at the moment), it was being taken out of context. The young mother was about to 
bust in and stop whatever they were doing, seeing as the threeway she almost walked in on 
had unnerved her. Who knew what else could be going on?!

      However, as she eased the door open, she was greeted by a heartwarming sight. Eveon 
was sprawled out on the bed, on her tummy, with Mina giving her a back rub. What surprised 
Abby the most was that Eveon&#39;s shirt was on and it wasn&#39;t pushed up to reveal her back. The 
young mother let out a sigh of relief before quietly shutting the door. The last thing she 
needed was a third awkward lesbian moment...

      Eveon giggled as Mina started playing with her hair. &quot;It&#39;s so pretty,&quot; she murmured as 
Eveon turned over.&quot;Really? I think yours is nicer.&quot;

      Mina leaned down and gave her a nice long kiss. &quot;Do you think we should go to bed 
now?&quot; Eveon nodded and turned off the lamp as Mina got off of her to snuggle into the 
covers. The blonde girl followed her in the darkness and was soon enveloped by a pair of 
warm arms.

      &quot;Caught you,&quot; Mina said giggling before planting a wet kiss on Eveon&#39;s forehead. The 
blonde girl responded by wrapping her arms around Mina&#39;s waist. The ebony haired girl tried 
to stifle her laughs as Eveon exacted her revenge via tickling her girlfriend. Mina squirmed 
and started to laugh as Eveon found the perfect spot.

      Mina tried to tickle her back and a fight thus ensued. When they were finished, both 
were out of breath and the sheets were tangled up. They exchanged glances before Eveon 
scooted over and wrapped her arms around Mina again. The other girl started to play with her 
blonde hair as she laid her head on Mina&#39;s bosom.

      &quot;You know what someone told me today?&quot; Eveon asked, looking up at Mina. &quot;They said 
that they could tell I was in love.&quot;

      There was a bit of silence as a warm smile crept onto Mina&#39;s face. &quot;I love you too, 
Eveon...&quot; The blonde gave her a teasing kiss and Mina had to lean in more to catch her 
girlfriend. It was then that Eveon could feel some moisture on her face. She pulled away to 
see Mina was crying.

      &quot;Why... why are you crying...? Did I do something wrong?&quot; Eveon asked as she started 
to wipe away her tears.

      &quot;I&#39;m just... so happy...&quot; she said in between sniffles before laying her head on 
Eveon&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Before last year... Before we were together, I was so afraid that you 
would never love me and you would just hate me or be disgusted or... or-&quot; Mina was cut off 
by a kiss.

      &quot;Now is not the time to get all emo on me. I love you and I know you love me. Nothing 
is ever going to change that because love is steadfast, right?&quot; Eveon sat up, pulling Mina 
along with her.

      &quot;See?&quot; She grabbed Mina&#39;s hand and placed just a little bit higher than her left 
breast. &quot;My heart beats really fast when you&#39;re around; I&#39;m probably going to get high blood 
pressure... but I don&#39;t mind.&quot; The usually unabashed Mina blushed at feeling Eveon&#39;s naked 
skin and being so close to her... but she could feel her heartbeat just the same.

      &quot;I know it&#39;s the same for you, too...&quot; Eveon murmured, placing her hand over Mina&#39;s 
heart. &quot;Yours is beating fast too.&quot;

      They sat there, silent, not wanting to move or ruin the moment. Slowly, Mina moved 
closer and removed her hand. Eveon let out a gasp when she kissed that same spot instead and 
pushed the two of them down onto the bed. She rested her head on Eveon&#39;s chest, her ear 
snugly up against the spot she just kissed.

      &quot;Can I listen?&quot; Mina asked shyly. &quot;Of course...&quot; She could feel Eveon&#39;s running her 
hands through her short hair and she could hear her heartbeat. Her chest was so warm...

      &quot;Goodnight...&quot; Eveon murmured, before giving her a kiss. &quot;Goodnight,&quot; Mina said back, 
a smile on her face.
