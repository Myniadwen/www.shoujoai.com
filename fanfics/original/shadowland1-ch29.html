Deathly Reunion

Kris lay upon her bed staring up at the ceiling, Jenn&#39;s accusation still 
ringing in her ears. Should she have kept May&#39;s death a secret? Should 
she be keeping her feelings a secret? Where was this all leading her? 
She rolled over in the bed, with her back facing outwards and curled her 
knees close to her chest as an overwhelming pain filled her heart.  

&quot;Now this is a sight I missed&quot; A voice said from behind Kris, &quot;You 
huddled in bed like you used to do all the time.&quot; 

Kris did not turn around to see who spoke, &quot;What are you doing here, 
Gwen?&quot; She asked while she rolled over and crossing her arms behind her 
head. 

The Angel of Death sat upon the desk chair, her wings faded away leaving 
only a few glowing feathers drifting through the air. One floated near 
Kris and she reached out to touch the feather only to have it disappear 
in her hands. Gwen gazed upon the photo on the girl&#39;s desk, &quot;Angelina 
told me you were back, so I thought I would give you a bit of a holler.&quot; 
She said as she leaned her back in the chair and looked, upside down out 
the window as the sun crossed the sky. 

&quot;I don&#39;t care for your company, so why don&#39;t you just go away.&quot; Kris 
said, wrapping her arms over her eyes.

&quot;Now that is not the Aigneis that I remember so dearly.&quot; Gwen said, 
getting up and walking over to the girl&#39;s side. 

Kris uncovered her eyes to glared angrily at the Angel, &quot;I&#39;m not 
Aigneis, and you know it, so stop bothering me.&quot; Kris&#39;s word where like 
acid to the angel and she winced in pain. 

&quot;Oh, that is right,&quot; Gwen spoke more to herself, trying to cover the 
hurt, &quot;You changed your name didn&#39;t you... what was it? Crystal or 
something like that?&quot; She watched Kris in amusement. 

&quot;Kris Tallet!!&quot; Kris was getting angrier every moment she had to look at 
this girl whom she once considered her sister, &quot;Now if you don&#39;t have 
anything better to say, then I have things to do.&quot; She sat up and 
started to get out of the bed.

&quot;Actually I do have something you would have an interest in.&quot; Gwen said 
with a grin. 

Kris stopped on the spot, &quot;Please... I am not in the mood for games 
right now.&quot; She said softly, almost dismally. 

Gwen pointed to herself, &quot;Me? Games? I think you have me confused with 
little Carey. When have I ever played any games on you?&quot;

Kris let out a deep sigh, &quot;Never... I just...&quot; Kris slowly shook her 
head, &quot;I just want to be left alone.&quot; 

Gwen appeared beside Kris with an arm around the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You 
know full well that I defended you against Father. He had no right to 
treat you the way he did.&quot; 

&quot;Please don&#39;t remind me.&quot; Kris let out a deeper sigh then looked at the 
girl, &quot;Didn&#39;t dad forbid you all from visiting me?&quot; Kris asked 
curiously. 

&quot;Yeah, but when have I been known to listen to father?&quot; Gwen said with a 
slight chuckle. 

&quot;True.&quot; Kris smiled, &quot;You and Angelina were always getting into trouble 
with him.&quot;

&quot;We all love you.&quot; Gwen added, &quot;I wish that Julie and Dad would stop 
being so closed minded about everything.&quot;

&quot;Did you come here just to reminisce?&quot; Kris asked still suspicious of 
her sister.

&quot;No, I brought a gift for you.&quot; Gwen started to dig in her pockets. 

&quot;What ever it is you can keep it.&quot; Kris started to walk towards the 
window. Below she could see Amy, Jessica, Natalie, Kim and Jenn leaving 
the building, &quot;Where are they all going?&quot; She said, a sense of unease 
wormed into her soul, then watched the girls for a moment and noticed 
the direction they were moving, &quot; No...&quot; She whispered then turned and 
started out of the room.

&quot;Are you sure you would not want this?&quot; Gwen pulled her hand out of her 
vest pocket and opened it. In the palm of the girl&#39;s hand was a small 
glowing light. 

Kris turned around and stared at the light with eyes wide open, &quot;Is 
that?&quot; She refused to believe what she was seeing, but it just had to 
be. She could feel it deep inside of her, &quot;You didn&#39;t? 

&quot;Angelina and I thought you would want this back.&quot; Gwen took Kris&#39;s hand 
in hers, &quot;I hope you can one day forgive us.&quot; 

&quot;What have you done?&quot; Kris exclaimed, &quot;You can&#39;t just waltz into 
someone&#39;s mind and take what you want. Even if it is locked away.&quot;

&quot;Well then, it is now up to you to do as you like with it.&quot; She placed 
the light in Kris&#39; hand and watched her sister&#39;s eyes close as the soft 
glow washed over her, &quot;Throw it away, keep it or give it back. It is all 
up to you.&quot; When Kris opened her eyes, Gwen was gone. She opened her 
hand and the light was gone as well, but she could feel it inside her 
chest. She felt as if she were holding Jenn close to her. She could 
almost smell the girl&#39;s hair and feel her skin next to her. She shook 
her head slowly, &quot;What have you done...?&quot; She mumbled to the empty room.
