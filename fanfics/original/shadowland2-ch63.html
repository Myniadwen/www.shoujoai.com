<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch62.html">Back to Part 62</a><pre>Jessica stumbled as she fell through a mirror. She glanced around to 
find a fine layer of fog circling around her knees, &quot;Oh great. Not this 
place again.&quot; She remarked in distaste. 

Penny bumped into Jessica and would have tumbled to the ground if her 
sister had not caught her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She apologized as she struggled 
to free her foot from the frame of the mirror she had just fallen 
through. 

Jessica helped the girl to her feet and stared at her, &quot;You made it out. 
We actually made it!&quot; Tears filled her eyes and she hugged Penny tight 
in her arms. 

Penny seemed surprised by her sister&#39;s actions, &quot;What is wrong Jessie?&quot; 
She inquired, &quot;You act like you haven&#39;t seen me in years.&quot; She blinked 
at her sister as she noticed that the girl had aged before her very 
eyes, &quot;How come you have grown?&quot; She inquired confusingly. 

Jessica pulled back from the girl and rubbed at her eyes, &quot;It&#39;s hard to 
explain.&quot; She glanced around to see the other girls were nowhere in 
sight, &quot;What happened to Amber and the others?&quot; She inquired worriedly. 

Kim suddenly stepped through the mirror, &quot;They are probably back where 
they belong.&quot; She stated simply. 

&quot;Back where they belong?&quot; Jessica asked anxiously, &quot;What do you mean by 
that? I want to see Amber again.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kim apologized sympathetically, &quot;I don&#39;t make up the rules 
here.&quot; 

Penny stepped closer to Kim and scanned the girl before her. Kim was now 
back to her original age and dressed in her pyjama&#39;s again, &quot;Kim?&quot; She 
glance up and down the girl&#39;s body in astonishment, &quot;What happened to 
you?&quot; 

Kim looked over her body to see that she indeed had returned to normal, 
then scratched her head in embarrassment, &quot;I guess you find me ugly now 
that I&#39;m older.&quot; She remarked dismally. 

Penny shook her head, &quot;No, no you&#39;re as beautiful as ever... but... 
there is something different about you.&quot; Penny commented as she scanned 
her love&#39;s new appearance. Kim&#39;s fiery red hair had changed to now 
lightly brush her shoulders and its vibrant fiery red had dulled to a 
light amber colour. Her eyes had also changed, they traded in their ruby 
red for a soft brown with flecks of red along their edges, &quot;What 
happened to your eyes... and hair? Weren&#39;t they red before?&quot; She 
inquired curiously.

Kim blinked at the girl in bewilderment, &quot;They aren&#39;t red?&quot; She 
inquired, slightly flustered. 

Jessica nodded her head; &quot;I remember that being the odd thing about you 
when I first saw you.&quot; She remarked as she also looked into the girl&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;I&#39;d never seen anyone with red eyes before and now they look like 
everyone else.&quot;

An unsettling feeling began to build up inside of Kim&#39;s stomach, &quot;We 
have to get out of this place.&quot; She stated, nervously glancing at the 
mirrors around her. Quickly she searched each mirror, looking for 
something in particular. 

Penny watched the girl in amusement, &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; She 
puzzled, then glanced into one of the mirrors and saw an image of 
herself kissing Kim on the washroom floor, &quot;Ummm...&quot; A flush crossed her 
face. 

Jessica placed a hand upon her sister&#39;s shoulder and gently ushered her 
away from the mirrors, &quot;Trust me... you don&#39;t want to peer into those.&quot; 
She warned the girl. 

&quot;But how can Kim look into them?&quot; Penny inquired innocently, &quot;What does 
she see?&quot; 

Jessica shook her head, &quot;I guess she has already faced her past.&quot; She 
remarked, not really knowing the answer, but felt the time for questions 
would be for later.

What Jessica did not realized was she could not have been further from 
the truth. Over the years that Kim was trapped in the Hall of Mirrors by 
her other self she found a way to glance into the mirrors without 
actually gazing upon the images they reflected. If she looked carefully 
she could find a mirror that reflected the present and give her a 
glimpse into what was happening in the real world. She hastily moved 
from one mirror to another, trying hard to not take in the images before 
her, because she knew gazing too long in one of these mirrors could 
drive a person mad. Amongst the many oddly shaped mirrors she came 
across something unusual, a black mirror that was the shape of a 
television screen. She blinked at it in confusion and puzzled over its 
purpose for being amongst these mirrors. 

Jessica cautiously approached the girl, &quot;Is there something wrong?&quot; She 
inquired apprehensively. 

Kim pointed at the black screen before her, &quot;What&#39;s this doing here?&quot; 
She asked, titling her head curiously as she peered upon its surface. 

Jessica looked upon the screen and blinked in confusion, &quot;I don&#39;t know. 
I don&#39;t understand anything that is going on here so I have no idea what 
its doing here.&quot; She remarked hopelessly. 

Penny leaned in close to the screen and squinted, &quot;I think I can see a 
room in the reflection.&quot; She stated uncertainly. 

&quot;A room?&quot; Kim moved in closer and tried to focus on the vague shapes 
upon the screen&#39;s surface, &quot;It&#39;s the lobby!&quot; She exclaimed excitedly, &quot;I 
think that is Jessica on the couch to the right and you, Penny, on the 
couch to the left.&quot; She tilted her head as she gazed upon the image 
before herself. She could see herself lying on the ground next to Penny 
and Jenn kneeling on the ground with Amy cradling the girl in her arms. 
There was a terrible sadness upon Jenn&#39;s face as the nurse slowly rocked 
the girl. Something horrible had just happened and Kim was not sure if 
she wanted to know what it was. 

&quot;So how do we get back there?&quot; Jessica finally asked, lightly tapping 
upon the TV. 

Kim swallowed back her worries and moved Jessica&#39;s hand from the screen, 
&quot;Like this.&quot; She placed her hands to either of the top corners of the 
screen, &quot;Penny come to my left side and place your hand upon the bottom 
corner.&quot; 

&quot;Alright.&quot; Penny promptly did as she was told. 

&quot;Jessica, I want you to do the same on the right.&quot; Kim requested. 

Jessica was not sure she understood what Kim was up too, but did as she 
was told all the same, &quot;Now what?&quot; She inquired puzzled by Kim&#39;s 
requests. 

&quot;Close your eyes and concentrate inside of yourself.&quot; Kim explained. She 
waited till each girl had their eyes closed before she too lightly 
closed her own eyes, &quot;Try to look inside of your hearts. Focus deep 
inside until you find your core. Your soul&quot; She whispered softly, &quot;Focus 
on that feeling and think of yourself as the image in the television 
showed. Everyone ready?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Both girls replied. 

&quot;Then let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; Kim took her right hand off the corner and 
lightly knocked upon the screen, &quot;Let&#39;s return home.&quot;
