<h1>Prophecy of Krishinda: The Kusagana Myth (part 7 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/krishinda-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&#147;And so that&#146;s what happened to you guys.&#148;
 
Mitsuki, Anju, Miki and Genzo all at there in wonder at Akira&#146;s story. 
The Heaven Slayers were in Genzo&#146;s room at the Ivory Vale Inn and they 
had finally woken up from that odd sleep spell that the forth devil 
had put them under. 
 
Genzo closed his eyes and frowned. &#147;I don&#146;t like the fact that you 
went after a devil alone.&#148;
 
Anju shrugged. &#147;What could she do? We were all asleep and couldn&#146;t get 
up. And anyway she took care of it. And she isn&#146;t hurt so, what&#146;s the 
problem?&#148;
 
Genzo took that in for a brief moment and accepted it. &#147;Okay.&#148;
 
&#147;Well that&#146;s one less devil we have to worry about. Where to next?&#148; 
Miki asked. 
 
&#147;We should move on to Zauuya village, and from there, we move on to 
Hakumakyuu. Those are the last two places I remember hearing about 
devils. We&#146;ll move out tomorrow morning.&#148;
 
While the others we talking about the next destination, Akira was 
watching Mitsuki. The young healer was uncharacteristically quiet, 
taking into account what just happened she had every right to not want 
to say anything, but still, Akira didn&#146;t like it. 
 
Later on that evening, Akira and Mitsuki made their way back to their 
room. However Mitsuki still hadn&#146;t said more than two words to her. As 
they went inside, Akira took off her armour again and lay down, 
breathing a sigh of relief. She could finally get a good night&#146;s rest. 
But Mitsuki didn&#146;t resolve as easily. She was just standing next to 
the bed, with a fearful look on her face.
 
Akira did not like it one little bit. 
 
&#147;Mitsuki are you okay? Why are you so quiet?&#148; Akira asked.
 
Mitsuki stared at Akira blankly for a second, then mumbled under her 
breath. &#147;My...dream...&#148;
 
{So that&#146;s it} Akira thought in realization. {Her dream must have 
frightened her. I did find her crying...I wonder what happened...}
 
Akira quickly walked over to Mitsuki and held her in a warm embrace. 
It took a while for Mitsuki to settle peacefully in Akira&#146;s arms, but 
eventually she did so, separating the dream Akira and the real Akira.
 
A few tears sprinkled down Mitsuki&#146;s cheeks to think about it. The 
Akira in the dream was so mean, so horrible to her. In her heart she 
knew that...thing was not Akira, but still, it hurt so much...
 
&#147;The things...that you said to me...&#148; Mitsuki managed to get out. 
 
Akira was shocked at first when she heard that. She was the one that 
caused Mitsuki&#146;s unhappiness? Akira tried to shake it out of her 
system though. It was a dream, and only a dream.
 
&#147;I don&#146;t know what I said in your dream, Mitsuki. But if it was bad 
enough for you to react like this, then I know that would never have 
said it in real life. I care for you so much, Mitsuki...&#148;
 
Mitsuki sniffled a bit. &#147;Really?&#148;
 
&#147;Yes, really. In my dream you didn&#146;t even know that I existed.&#148;
 
The blonde smiled at that. &#147;That&#146;s silly. You&#146;re my best friend.&#148; 
 
&#147;I know. That&#146;s what I said.&#148;
 
Akira pulled back from Mitsuki slowly to look at her. She seemed a bit 
better now that she was reassured of the fact that it was just a 
dream. But Akira had to be sure.
 
&#147;Are you felling better now, Mitsuki?&#148; Akira asked.
 
Mitsuki smiled generously. &#147;Yeah. A little.&#148; 
 
&#147;Alright then. Come on, let&#146;s get some sleep.&#148; Akira said.
 
The young knight was about to go to her bed to lie down, until Mitsuki 
held her by the wrist. There was a desperate look of panic in 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes. 
 
&#147;Akira, I don&#146;t want...I mean I can&#146;t...Akira, will you sleep with me? 
I know its rude to ask but if go back to sleep and see you like-&#147;
 
Akira put a finger to Mitsuki&#146;s lips to silence her when she stared to 
get a little hysterical. The last thing Akira wanted was for Mitsuki 
to flip her wig over something stupid like a dream.
 
&#147;Hush, Mitsuki. It&#146;s okay. I&#146;ll sleep with you tonight.&#148;
 
**********
 
The next day, the Heaven Slayers left Rz&#146;oawrein city, and headed for 
the Zauuya cliffs. Zauuya village was in a mountainous area, so some 
uphill climbing needed to be done. This didn&#146;t bother the gang, but it 
did slow down their movements. 
 
Anyway after hiking up the crags of the Zauuya cliffs for around four 
days, the Heaven Slayers made it up to the top. But still, Zauuya 
village was a few miles away yet. So before moving on, Genzo elected 
that they camp where they were for a few days, so that the group could 
rejuvenate themselves from the harsh climb up the cliffs. Needless to 
say, there were no arguments. 
 
While Genzo and Anju were off doing other things, Mitsuki, Miki and 
Akira decided that they needed to bathe before doing anything else. 
There was a pure lake nearby, with clean, safe water so the three 
girls went there. 
 
After Miki checked the area for any onlookers, the three girls 
undressed and dove into the refreshing water. The Zauuya area had a 
lot of natural hot springs, so to the water was warm and unwinding. 
 
Considering the amount of work the Heaven Slayers had been doing, 
journeying and fighting, this was a welcomed break from it all.
 
Whereas Mitsuki and Akira were just splashing each other and having 
fun, Miki was actually using the time to loosen up and undo some of 
those knots. 
 
Miki sighed wistfully to herself as she looked up at the stars. 
 
As Mitsuki splashed her, Akira noticed how quiet and deep in thought 
Miki was. Akira looked at Mitsuki and nodded over to Miki.
 
&#147;What is the matter with her?&#148; Akira asked. 
 
Mitsuki looked at Miki. &#147;I don&#146;t know. Hey, maybe she&#146;s thinking about 
Anju!&#148;
 
Akira seemed confused. &#147;You noticed it too?&#148;
 
&#147;Well of course. You can tell Anju is a flirt, but he only ever tries 
it on with Miki. Y&#146;know, I think he really does love her.&#148;
 
&#147;Yes but something happened between them. And I don&#146;t think Miki can 
forgive him for that. Whatever he did.&#148;
 
Mitsuki put her hand on her chin and thought for a second. &#147;Lets find 
out.&#148; 
 
The blonde dove under the water and swam for Miki. Akira followed 
suit. The two girls swam up to Miki, and threw dual looks of 
curiousness at her. 
 
It made Miki feel just a teeny little bit nervous. &#147;What?&#148;
 
Mitsuki was the first one to speak. &#147;We wanna know what&#146;s up with you 
and Anju!&#148;
 
&#147;Actually, it&#146;s Mitsuki who wants to know about you and Anju. I just 
wanted to know why looked so sad.&#148;
 
Mitsuki turned to Akira in mock anger. &#147;You liar! You know that you&#146;re 
dying to find out about Miki and Anju.&#148;
 
Akira crossed her arms and looked away with a clever smile on her 
face. &#147;You know, not everyone is as nosy as you, Mitsuki...&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes flared. &#147;What?! Why you lit-&#147;
 
&#147;Girls.&#148; Miki said, snapping Akira and Mitsuki back into focus. &#147;Anju 
and I are just old friends. We had something once, but now...it&#146;s 
over. And to answer your question Akira, was not feeling sad as such, 
just thinking about some things. That&#146;s all really.&#148;
 
&#147;So you are okay?&#148; Akira asked. 
 
Miki simply nodded, and stood upright, walking over to the bank to 
pick up her clothes. Akira and Mitsuki just then looked at each other 
confusedly, but put it away and swam back into the middle of the lake. 
 
Miki grabbed a towel, quickly dried herself off, and put her clothes 
on. She knew that Akira and Mitsuki meant no harm, but Miki still 
didn&#146;t feel comfortable about talking with reference to Anju. As she 
got changed, she called out to the two girls to warn them not to stay 
out there for too long. The only thing she heard in response to that 
was, &#145;Stop splashing me, Mitsuki!&#146; and &#145;then don&#146;t let your guard 
down, Akira!&#146;
 
Miki just sighed and walked back to the campsite. Whilst walking 
though, Miki ran into Anju, while he was trying to get some firewood 
for the campfire. 
 
The two stared at each other for a little while, neither one of them 
daring to say anything to the other.
 
Eventually, Anju was the first to speak. &#147;Hi.&#148;
 
&#147;Hi.&#148; Miki&#146;s response was equally eloquent.
 
Anju and Miki walked back to the campsite together. Despite what the 
others might have thought, Anju wasn&#146;t completely confident with 
himself. Whenever he did something that might have upset someone, he 
stepped carefully around them. Not out of consideration, but out of 
nerves. This didn&#146;t seem to be the case with Miki. Anju seemed be 
genuinely understanding of her feelings, and since they left Soryu, he 
wasn&#146;t coming on as strong as before.
 
It was then that Miki really started to believe that Anju might have 
changed. 
 
When the two reached the campsite, Anju set the wood down by the fire, 
and Miki searched for Genzo. He was not there. He probably went out 
for a walk. 
 
Anju threw two pieces of wood into the fire, refuelling the blaze, and 
he sat down on a log, next to the log that Miki was now sitting on. 
 
Anju looked at the fire. &#147;I guess that should keep the fire going 
through the night, huh?&#148;
 
&#147;Yeah.&#148;
 
The second of the Twelve Dragons looked at his former love. 
 
&#147;Listen Miki...I&#146;m sorry about what happened at Soryu. If I had known 
that Mitsuki was going to be marrying Kai...I wouldn&#146;t have tried so 
hard.&#148;
 
Miki sighed. &#147;It&#146;s okay. You didn&#146;t know. And I told you; I don&#146;t 
regret the choices I made.&#148;
 
&#147;Not even a little?&#148; Anju asked. 
 
The Soujumah priestess&#146;s lips curled into a smile. &#147;Well...maybe a 
little.&#148;  
 
Anju looked into the sky. &#147;I wonder what they are doing in Daitoshi 
city right now...&#148;
 
&#147;Probably planning the wedding.&#148; Miki said.
 
&#147;Are the Soujumah that forward thinking?&#148; 
 
&#147;Yep.&#148; Miki supplied. &#147;Unless they have changed since I was last at 
Daitoshi city.&#148;
 
&#147;You can&#146;t run from them forever, Miki.&#148; 
 
Miki spoke quickly. &#147;I know that. But my father still won&#146;t even talk 
to me. What else can I do?&#148;
 
That had Anju stumped. &#147;I guess you&#146;ve got a point there.&#148;
 
&#147;Anyway, enough about me. What have you been doing these past seven 
years?&#148;
 
Anju looked at his bracer and unlocked it, revealing his tattoo. 
 
&#147;Well as you know, I&#146;m one of the Twelve dragons. After I left 
Daitoshi, I needed something to get mind off...the past. I started 
going to the Mashumei Mountains, and I learned a few bits about 
hiking, then one day, I had an accident. I fell off a ravine, during 
some powerful winds. I survived, but I lost the use of both my legs. 
At first I thought my life was finished, but then an old man came to 
me. He said that if I studied under him, I might be able to regain my 
ability to walk. I spent four years with the master, working on my 
upper body strength and redeveloping my lower body strength. After all 
my hard work, I had the power to walk again. It was just then that 
realized how much power I had. And, you know me; I am not the type to 
let it go to waste. So I entered some fighting tournaments and won 
fairly easily. But something felt missing, you know. Anyway I 
eventually met a mysterious old guy after a won a big championship. He 
told me that if I took the contest of Dragons, I&#146;d get a place in one 
of the Twelve. And so I took it. I challenged each of the Twelve 
Dragons consecutively. It took everything I had but I made it all the 
way up to the last Dragon. But he beat me. I was too tired, and he was 
too powerful. So I became second of the Twelve. After that I became a 
mercenary. Then, two years later, I get given a note from Genzo, 
hiring me to work for the Heaven Slayers. And here I am.&#148;
 
Miki smiled at Anju. &#147;You&#146;ve been leading an interesting life.&#148;
 
Anju leaned back and stretched his arms. &#147;Not really.&#148;  
 
The Soujumah priestess paused for a second and looked at Anju. 
*Really* looked at him. He seemed some much more mature then he did 
seven years ago. Anju had really grown a lot. 
 
{He has changed so much.} Miki thought. 
 
Stealing himself, Anju turned to Miki and looked deeply into her eyes, 
almost losing himself for a second, but recovered enough for him to 
utter a few words.
 
&#147;I missed you.&#148; Anju said, putting emphasis on the word &#145;missed&#146;.  
 
Miki smiled at him briefly. &#147;I missed you too.&#148;
 
**********
 
Genzo sat down on the cold, wet grass and lost himself in a trance. He 
had told no one but Genzo had a bad feeling about the Zauuya cliffs. 
Something the back of his mind just would not let it rest, and Genzo 
would not be happy until he checked out the situation. 
 
Around half a dozen ofuda were attached to some nearby trees, and as 
Genzo started to chant, the markings on them lit up with a bright red.
 
{Mighty spirit of fortune, lend me your wisdom and foresee our path. 
What lies in store for us?}
 
A spirit spoke inside Genzo&#146;s mind. 
 
&lt;I must warn you. Very soon, you will be faced with the grim tyrant of 
your enemy...&gt; 
 
A twig broke behind Genzo, and the old master&#146;s eyes snapped open. 
Only for him to pass out as a flash of black leapt out for the bushes. 
 
**********
 
Mitsuki swam up to the bank while her best friend put her clothes on. 
Although they were alone, they were both...naked. However Akira didn&#146;t 
seem to mind at all. She was totally unaware of how generously gifted 
her body was. Normally Mitsuki would have been embarrassed to watch 
Akira like that, but this time she didn&#146;t mind. There was nothing 
kinky or funny about the situation. It was, in a very loud way, 
innocent. 
 
Akira pulled up her armour over her shoulders, and she buckled the 
strap that tied Dragon-edge to her back.
 
The 113th knight looked out to her friend. &#147;Mitsuki. Come on, put your 
clothes on and let&#146;s go, the others are probably waiting for us.&#148;  
 
The blonde pouted. &#147;Ohhhh...I wanted to stay a little longer...&#148;
 
Akira fastened her collar. &#147;We can come back tomorrow.&#148;
 
&#147;Oh.&#148; Mitsuki said. &#147;Okay.&#148;
 
After scolding herself for overreacting, Mitsuki climbed onto the bank 
and dried her body off with one of her towels. Mitsuki then carefully 
put her clothes back on and continued to dry her hair, throwing some 
curious looks at Akira. The young knight was staring at her.
 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyebrow rose. &#147;What?&#148;
 
Seeing that she had been caught out, Akira blushed a deep scarlet and 
reprimanded herself. 
 
&#147;Nothing.&#148; Akira said hastily. 
 
Mitsuki just shrugged and continued to dry her hair. About a quarter 
of an hour later, Mitsuki and Akira left the lake. The two were 
walking back to the campsite. 
 
Akira then stopped moving, and put an arm in front of Mitsuki. The 
cautious knight then studied her surroundings, focusing on the low 
bushes and the many trees around them.
 
Mitsuki noted the attentive look on Akira&#146;s face. &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;
 
Akira grabbed Mitsuki&#146;s hand and pulled the blonde closer to her, 
Akira&#146;s crystal blue eyes shifting to her best friend. 
 
&#147;Something doesn&#146;t feel right.&#148; Akira said quickly.
 
All of a sudden, a shadow of a small rock behind Akira and Mitsuki 
began to grow larger in length, and was pointing in Mitsuki&#146;s 
direction. 
 
Neither Akira nor Mitsuki noticed this, and soon, the shadow sprouted 
a pair of gold-tinted eyes, sliding under Mitsuki&#146;s feet. Akira felt 
Mitsuki&#146;s hand grow colder, and looked curiously at her. But the look 
that Mitsuki threw back was not as warm.
 
Akira let go of Mitsuki, as the blonde leered at her with a devious 
look of intent.
 
&#147;Mitsuki...?&#148; 
 
&#147;So...you are the one who killed my brother and sister...&#148; Mitsuki 
said, her eyes gleaming with an amused hatred.
 
Akira was very confused. &#147;What are you talking about?&#148;
 
Mitsuki, or what seemed to be Mitsuki, leapt at Akira and clutched her 
throat in a tight death grip. Akira grabbed Mitsuki&#146;s arm, and tried 
desperately to free herself from Mitsuki&#146;s grasp. 
 
The dark haired girl coughed. &#147;What are you...doing?&#148;
 
Mitsuki scowled. &#147;Be silent!&#148;
 
As Akira&#146;s oxygen flow was weakened, she felt herself becoming 
light-headed. She didn&#146;t notice the strength that Mitsuki was using to 
do this. Akira lowered herself to one knee.
 
&#147;Stop Mitsuki, please...&#148; Akira managed. 
 
Mitsuki just smiled viciously, and tightened the grip she had on 
Akira&#146;s neck. This was do or die for the young knight. If she didn&#146;t 
do something quickly, she was going to pass out. Managing to keep one 
eye open, Akira tugged on Mitsuki&#146;s arm, and pulled back. This caught 
Mitsuki off guard, and managed to free up her grip long enough for 
Akira to pull Mitsuki&#146;s hand off her throat. 
 
Akira leapt back and took in quick gulps of air, staring at the 
blonde. &#147;Why did you do that, Mitsuki?&#148;
 
&#147;Oh please. Your little friend has no control over this body. I am in 
command of this vessel, and I will have to revenge myself upon you for 
taking the lives of my siblings.&#148;
 
Akira breathed heavily. &#147;Your siblings...?&#148; Akira&#146;s eyes the widened 
as she figured out what was going on. &#147;You&#146;re a devil!&#148;
 
The Devil-Mitsuki put her arms on her waist. &#147;That&#146;s right. The third 
devil, as you humans so like to call me.&#148;
 
Akira quickly unsheathed Dragon-edge, and stepped slowly towards the 
devil. &#147;Then I&#146;m warning you now. Get out of Mitsuki&#146;s body.&#148;
 
&#147;Or what? You know perfectly well that you can&#146;t hurt this body.&#148;
 
That made Akira think. Devil-Mitsuki was right. Akira could never hurt 
Mitsuki willingly. That made the situation a little more complicated. 
 
Devil-Mitsuki smirked. &#147;I thought so.&#148;
 
&#147;Stay where you are,&#148; Akira threatened. &#147;...I&#146;ll...I&#146;ll...&#148;
 
Devil-Mitsuki stepped forwards to challenge that threat. &#147;You&#146;ll do 
what? Nothing, that&#146;s what. But don&#146;t worry. I am going to break you 
down piece by piece. Not in a crude way like my brother and sister, 
but in a more affective way...&#148;
 
Akira held Dragon-edge tighter. &#147;What is that supposed to mean?&#148;
 
After smirking at Akira again, the Devil-Mitsuki passed out and fell 
to the ground, a demonic living shadow seeping out of Mitsuki&#146;s body 
lazily. Akira needed no second ushering, as she tossed Dragon-edge 
aside and ran to her best friend; pulling Mitsuki up into her arms 
carefully.
 
Akira checked Mitsuki&#146;s body for any injuries. &#147;Mitsuki are you 
alright? Speak to me...&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes slowly fluttered open, and she beamed a pleasant smile 
at the dark haired girl. &#147;Akira...&#148;
 
Akira sighed in relief. &#147;You&#146;re okay.&#148;
 
&#147;Akira, the devil. It&#146;s not dead yet...&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
&#147;I know. I saw it exit your body and then I ran to...&#148;
 
Akira stopped speaking very quickly, and her eyes closed sharply. 
Mitsuki became worried, noticing that Akira&#146;s warm touch became much 
colder than before. 
 
Akira&#146;s eyes opened slowly, a dark look of contempt written over her 
face. Akira abruptly let go of Mitsuki, and walked over to her sword, 
clasping it firmly in her hand. 
 
Mitsuki&#146;s worry increased. &#147;Akira?&#148; 
 
Akira slowly walked back to Mitsuki and tightened her grip on the 
Dragon-edge, smiling darkly at the blonde. 
 
&#147;Come on. You must realize what has happened. I am in possession of 
your pathetic little friend&#146;s body.&#148;
 
Mitsuki stood up and backed away from the now Devil-Akira. 
 
&#147;Why are you doing this?&#148; Mitsuki asked, her voice breaking in fear.
 
&#147;This woman killed my family. Now, under the same situation, would you 
do any different? The blood of my family is on her hands, and I want 
her to feel the same agony I feel. I am going to start by attacking 
her mind. I am going to kill you, by HER hands. Then I&#146;ll move on to 
the rest of you, and finish off the others. Then, when I leave her 
body, she will be tormented by the fact that she killed all of her 
friends...quite ingenious don&#146;t you think...?&#148;
 
&#147;You can&#146;t do that to Akira!&#148; Mitsuki yelled. 
 
Devil-Akira raised the Dragon-edge into the air, and stared at Mitsuki 
menacingly. &#147;Just watch me...&#148;  
 
Mitsuki ran out of the way as Devil-Akira slashed at her. The worry 
and confusion in Mitsuki&#146;s heart was now evident. 
 
&#147;Akira! Fight it! You can&#146;t do this!&#148; 
 
If Akira was still in there, she couldn&#146;t hear because Devil-Akira 
continued to advance. Mitsuki backed away. She couldn&#146;t believe this 
was happening. And there seemed to be no way out.
 
&#147;Please...stop this Akira...&#148; 
 
Devil-Akira laughed at Mitsuki, then slashed at her again. It managed 
to cut open the front of Mitsuki&#146;s shirt, revealing her bare breasts, 
which she tried in vain to cover up. 
 
The amusement in Devil-Akira was hard to overlook, and the devil only 
grew more pleased the more fearful Mitsuki became. 
 
&#147;Akira,&#148; Mitsuki began. &#147;If there is any part of you left in there, 
fight that thing! You don&#146;t know how unhappy you will be if you hurt 
me!&#148;
 
Devil-Akira scowled. &#147;She can&#146;t hear you. I control her. I rule her.&#148;
 
Mitsuki continued back away, and she eventually stumbled over the 
large, imbedded root of a tree. The young healer fell to the ground, 
with the dark version of Akira towering over. For the first time, 
Mitsuki realized how intimidating Akira could be.
 
&#147;Please Akira, stop! You can&#146;t hurt me!&#148;
 
Devil-Akira took no notice of Mitsuki&#146;s heartfelt pleas, and raised 
the Dragon-edge into the air with both hands, the edge of the blade 
aimed straight at Mitsuki.
 
Devil-Akira smiled a sinister smile. &#147;Goodbye. I&#146;ll give Akira your 
regards...&#148;
 
Mitsuki&#146;s eyes widened in total shock. Akira was going to kill her. 
There was so much that needed to be said, so much that needed to be 
done, and now...    
 
Somewhere deep in her heart, Mitsuki drew the courage to yell out one 
final thing, as Akira&#146;s sword came plummeting down towards her. 
 
&#147;I love you, Akira!&#148;  Mitsuki screamed.
 
That one comment forced the darkness out of Akira&#146;s mind for a brief 
second, redirecting the Dragon-edge with eagle-like quickness. 
 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened sharply in realization when steel connected with 
flesh. The young knight&#146;s vision faded slowly, and she fell to the 
ground, slipping into unconsciousness.
