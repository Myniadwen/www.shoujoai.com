<h1>Project Angelus (part 9 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>      Eric was actually not in a bad mood after talking to Adrian for once in his life. In 
fact, he was ecstatic that the angel wasn&#39;t going to be killed and... well... He craned his 
neck a bit in his chair to get a nice view of Erin&#39;s butt as she busied herself with 
sorting out all the papers on his desk.

      She wasn&#39;t a cutie like Alice, but he wasn&#39;t going to complain about it. In fact, she 
was doing one great job of rearranging his files on his desk. Erin had been throwing him 
confused glances during his conversation, wanting to ask questions, but deciding it would 
be too... obvious. Her and Faye had worked hard to get inconspicuous jobs.

      They even had to live in separate places while they worked and Erin didn&#39;t even know 
what job Faye had and vice versa. The young woman pushed some of her hair back, happy that 
the two of them at least had enough magic to temporary change their hair color back to 
normal. She&#39;d been wondering what Faye&#39;s natural hair color was before she became a 
goddess...

      &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Eric said. At first, Erin thought he was still on the phone until 
she noticed him looking at her.

      &quot;Sorry for what?&quot;

      He shrugged. &quot;Oh, just having a conversation with the big boss. We talk about weird 
things...&quot;

      Erin nodded slowly as he got up and checked the time. &quot;Cripes! I&#39;ve been keeping you 
here a long time!&quot;

      &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s fine,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I still have things to finish up here. They&#39;re 
still files that need to be put away.&quot;

      &quot;Alright,&quot; he said, heading towards the door. &quot;I have a patient to check up on... by 
the way, Erin, can you take out all the files on Project Angelus and place them on my 
desk?&quot;

      Eric closed the door as he left and Erin grabbed some of the files on his desk. 
Project Angelus? It sounded... interesting. If her hunch was correct, then the angel Eveon 
told Seth about would be the same one Eric had been talking to Adrian about. She was sure 
Seth and his group would appreciate the information.

      But first... she put away all the useless documents in their appropriate spots in the 
file cabinet before pulling out a huge section of files. They were all on Project Angelus. 
She didn&#39;t know how long she would have until Eric came back, but if she hurried up and 
read some of it...

      &#39;Project Angelus requires first a demon angel hybrid in order to produce a core. Once 
a core is made, it can be transferred to a stronger host or kept within the prototype 
maker. The purpose of this is to harness the power of a forbidden hybrid, but have humans 
able to use it. Thus, a core will be inserted into a human and they will gain unimaginable 
powers.&#39;

      Erin swallowed uncomfortably. She would have to tell Tycara to be careful too... but 
she was under the impression that Tycara was the only hybrid in existence. She spied Eric 
Ackhart&#39;s name as the lead researcher. Had he really been doing such a thing just for the 
sake of power?

      &#39;In order to fully accomplish this experiment without bumps or problems, the Shadow 
Organization has assembled a makeshift family to adopt two girls. By providing a family 
structure, any psychological damage or disdain towards the organization should be 
minimized. The two primary subjects of this experiment consist of the prototype core maker 
and the prototype host. The plan failed due to an executive decision by the CEO of the 
Shadow Organization.&#39;

      Erin quickly focused her senses and listened. Snakes didn&#39;t have great hearing, but 
she could feel the tiniest vibrations in the floor... Eric was still in a room where she 
assumed the angel was while the only person in the hall was a nighttime janitor. The 
experiment she was reading didn&#39;t sound humane at all - the Shadow Organization didn&#39;t have 
a sketchy name for nothing.

      &#39;Prototype core maker: Miki Uramoto. Proposed prototype host: Alice Bailey. Both 
deceased. Actual prototype host: Codename &#39;Lilith&#39;.&#39; Erin could see a note had been 
scribbled next to the list of subjects. &#39;Miki Uramoto believed to have survived the 
incident. She is in possession of the Demon Buster technology, but seems to not have any of 
her previous hybrid powers nor the powers of the core.&#39;

      If she wasn&#39;t mistaken, Erin was sure that Miki was the name of the girl Eveon was 
traveling with... but that would mean Miki was an angel demon hybrid. 

***** 

      &quot;Great. We get the information on the angel after raiding this facility,&quot; Josh said, 
leaning against his spear. They&#39;d dismantled the barrier making the place invisible before 
storming the place and destroying everything irrelevant... but no angel.

      Bakra sighed and stretched. &quot;Well, they are an evil organization, so destroying one 
of their secret bases isn&#39;t a bad thing.&quot;

      Seth had gotten a text message from Erin stating that the angel was in the main 
headquarters and... Tycara was looking at his phone now. &quot;The girl with Eveon is a hybrid 
like me?&quot; The young woman shook her head. &quot;But that can&#39;t be possible. I&#39;m... I&#39;m the only 
half demon half angel around.&quot;

      Her boyfriend shrugged and took the phone back. &quot;Erin must have come across the info 
while undercover. But it&#39;s not impossible for an angel and a demon to have children.&quot;

      Josh shook his head. &quot;You&#39;re wrong, Seth. What Tycara says is true. She was born 
over... 2000 years ago, way before the angel taboo was put into place. Or else we&#39;d have 
halflings like Tycara all over the place.&quot;

      Bakra and Seth gave him a confused stare. &quot;Taboo?&quot; his boyfriend asked.

      &quot;Yeah, a long time ago, sometime after Tycara was born, the society of angels put a 
taboo over themselves. Any woman pregnant with an angel halfling of any sort will die upon 
childbirth along with their newborn.&quot;

      Seth grimaced. &quot;So they kill pregnant women? That&#39;s insane!&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re not listening,&quot; Josh said calmly. &quot;It&#39;s a curse. They don&#39;t kill anyone - the 
woman just dies along with her baby. The father gets off scot free... well, he gets exiled 
and has to deal with the guilt of causing two deaths, but you know what I mean.&quot;

      Tycara rubbed her arms, remembering the time when she lived near the angels. &quot;That 
taboo... they made it because of me. Because they didn&#39;t want another monster like me to 
exist.&quot;

      Seth held her closer. &quot;Hey, now... They&#39;re just a bunch of jerks. They don&#39;t like 
different things, that&#39;s all. You&#39;re a great girl, Tycara.&quot;

      Bakra and Josh watched the touching moment before exchanging glances. The two of them 
started walking on ahead to give them alone time. &quot;If what you said was true,&quot; the demon 
began, &quot;then how is this Miki girl a hybrid?&quot;

      Josh shrugged. &quot;Who knows? She should be dead, but I&#39;m sure there are loopholes in 
the taboo. I think Erin will enlighten us when she figures out more.&quot;

      His phone started to vibrate, so he took it out. Before separating, each person had 
to get their own cellular device for communication purposes. Josh looked at the message, 
this time from Faye. &quot;Huh... looks like she got a security job. She says that she can 
smuggle us safely into headquarters where we can meet up with Erin and rescue the angel.&quot;

      Bakra grinned. &quot;Damn, this plan is actually working out nicely. The sisters have 
already gotten to Eveon, Erin and Faye are super spies... all that leaves is our fiend 
extermination squad and Sakura.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m worried. Sakura is a definite target, so I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s planning on 
doing,&quot; Josh murmured, putting his phone away. &quot;Good thing Abby is with her... that should 
stop her from doing anything martyr-like.&quot;

      Bakra gave him a confused look and the blonde shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m just saying that Sakura 
seems like a very selfless woman and she might try to endanger herself to help everyone 
else.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;It&#39;s dinner time!&quot; Mina immediately cringed at the call. Making their way to the 
fiends was tough, even with Tsuru able to follow their energy with her demon eye and Demon 
Lord powers.

      But the hardest thing of all... well, the 16 year old girl was sure this was the real 
reason she was assigned to be in this group. Carmilla looked at her with a large grin. &quot;Are 
you ready Mina?&quot;

      Did she really have a choice? Carmilla couldn&#39;t feed off of Isaka (like the demon 
would let her) because she didn&#39;t taste good and Tsuru&#39;s blood was repulsive to her... 
Krystal was a definite no-no because both Tsuru and Isaka would freak out so... That left 
poor, young Mina. Not as good as Eveon, but to Carmilla, it was good enough.

        Mina let out a small cry as the vampire bit into her. Not to mention it was 
insanely awkward to have everyone else watching her get eaten...

      Tsuru twitched a little bit at the sight, but settled down. The five of them were 
currently staying at a small family owned inn since the fiends lived out in the middle of 
nowhere. The Lord of Demons watched as Carmilla pulled away happily, licking her lips. 
Krystal went over to start healing the wound on Mina&#39;s neck.

      &quot;Are you jealous?&quot; Tsuru jumped at the voice next to her ear and whirled around. 
Hoshi would do that to her all the time, but this time it was Isaka smiling at her.

      &quot;Why... why would I be?&quot; Even though she and Carmilla had almost gone all the way on 
their first in the shrine, things hadn&#39;t progressed that much. There were always 
interruptions, Carmilla trying to put her moves on at the wrong time or Tsuru just not... 
wanting to move that fast. She wished Carmilla wouldn&#39;t try to run all the bases every time 
they were along... it would be nicer if they went by little steps.

      &quot;I don&#39;t know, just because Mina is getting special attention from two beautiful 
women?&quot;

      &quot;Why do you feel the need to incessantly tease me about Krystal?&quot; Isaka just laughed 
at her.

      &quot;So... has the shrine been as interesting as ever?&quot;

      Tsuru frowned. &quot;Unfortunately. The three sisters have yet to actually become romantic 
but they&#39;re getting there, one awkward situation at a time. You should have seen Hina&#39;s 
face when Tsuki licked some cream off of the corner of her mouth.&quot;

      &quot;Oh wow... so are you the leader of the harem, or...?&quot; Isaka said, jokingly.

      Tsuru just shook her head. &quot;No, but I feel like Hoshi is trying to recruit me into 
being part of it...&quot;

      &quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m letting that happen!&quot; Carmilla had suddenly joined the 
conversation. &quot;Tsuru and I are going to be in an exclusive relationship!&quot;

      The Demon Lord let out a happy sigh. &quot;I guess it&#39;s really nice that she&#39;s committed.&quot;

      Carmilla uncharacteristically flushed bright red. &quot;Tsuru... you&#39;re complimenting 
me...?&quot;

      Isaka took that as her cue to leave the two of them in their own little section of 
the tiny room. By now, Krystal had finished healing Mina who was lying on the bed. &quot;I miss 
Eveon... I should have gone with Hoshi...&quot;

      Isaka sat down next to her. &quot;It&#39;ll be alright. We&#39;re going to meet up with them 
eventually since we&#39;re tracking the fiends... just get some rest.&quot; Mina was tired from the 
bloodsucking and drifted off easily.

      &quot;We&#39;ll have to make sure we have some food for her when she wakes up,&quot; Krystal said. 
&quot;Carmilla feeding on her blood can&#39;t be too good for her...&quot;

      &quot;Speaking of feeding...&quot; Isaka looked over to Tsuru, who currently had an amorous 
Carmilla sitting on her lap. &quot;I get the feeling if we had separate rooms, Carmilla would be 
devouring Tsuru tonight.&quot;

      That earned her a slap in the arm. Isaka just smiled and gave Krystal a kiss. The 
blonde leaned in and the demon was enjoying the special attention. As they broke away, 
Isaka murmured, &quot;How are we going to do this? There are only two beds so someone has to be 
with Mina-&quot;

      &quot;We call our own bed!&quot; Carmilla said happily, shoving Tsuru on the claimed piece of 
furniture.

      &quot;We... we do...?&quot; Tsuru asked, sprawled out on the bedspread. Carmilla just cuddle up 
next to her.

      &quot;Of course we do!&quot; Isaka and Krystal just smiled at the pseudo couple and looked over 
at Mina.

      Krystal laughed and said, &quot;I suppose next time we should just get separate rooms.&quot;
