<p>“Space  Race: bursting through the heavens!”</p>
<p>The  crowd became dead silent. Millions of people becoming so still sent  shivers up the spine, and the air became thick with joyous  anticipation. Chairwoman Stellkei stood by her wife’s side,  raising a white handkerchief in the air, a symbol of the fluttering  pure hearts gathered there and the heightened suspense they helped  create. Engines were revved up and pilots nervously hovered over the  accelerators. Sweat poured over skin. Palms became slick. Mouths  turned dry. Pulses soared. Hands were held. Time itself seemed to  freeze for but a moment.</p>
<p>All  Hell seemed to break loose as Ivy dropped the handkerchief and the  race began.</p>
<p>“Steady  as she goes,” Kay murmured to herself. “Shields up at maximum  and thrust is level. Plotting a course for our first checkpoint.”</p>
<p>“That’s  at the next planet, so we’ve got a ways to go yet,” Tee answered. She sighed as the <em>Dauntless</em> stood poised with infinite blackness ahead of it, their goal little  more than a pinprick on the monitor. “We registered too late; we  were left in the rear at the starting gate. You and I will have to  do some serious flying if we hope to catch up.”</p>
<p>“We’re  being saturated with particle energy waves, most likely the wake of  the other ships. Shields still holding. We’ll drop them once we  leave Centania’s gravity field. Gravitational acceleration is  expected to weaken in T-minus fifteen. Preparing boosters to break  away.”</p>
<p>“At  least  that satellite’s not in our way,” Tee observed, referring  to the orbiting space mine the ships had circled in their practice  run. The Hagan system was one of the largest in the entire galaxy,  boasting a staggering twenty planets, most of them very hospitable.  That this area had been overlooked so long for the races was simply  baffling: it suggested a long, tricky course that could defeat  lesser pilots and even put veterans to hard work. The circuit  basically revolved around weaving through most of the twenty planets  and their respective moons, going around the sun, then coming back  the other way, but even this cursory summary provided a daunting  challenge.</p>
<p>The  pilots were given use of Centania’s gravity to boost their run, but  after that, they were on their own until they reached the halfway  point. The course ran straight to Hagan 10, a prosperous world famed  for its schools (thanks to the Stellkei group), then it filtered  through a dust cloud that floated between the ninth and tenth  planets. Hagan 9 was slightly harsher to live on, but rich with  minerals that built up from the dust, and a docking station awaited  the pilots who needed a quick pit stop. It would also be the first  checkpoint; the second was Hagan 6, a temperate world with a small,  easygoing population that largely focused on agriculture and trade. It  was the perfect place to relax for a few hours, but so was its  moon, Oika. Pilots were expected to squeeze between the two worlds  in order to activate the checkpoint—certainly not a job for  novices.</p>
<p>The  third checkpoint was on Hagan 2, an unpopulated, uncultured world  that was constantly blasted by volcanic fire and ash. Despite this  hellishness, it was theoretically habitable, but the only people who  ever landed there were researchers and miners. Pilots would </p>
<p>have  to actually land for a moment in order to activate the marker; the  next one orbited the sun itself, sailing on solar flares and powerful  gravity blasts. The next three checkpoints became progressively more  difficult to approach: one was smack in the middle of an asteroid  field, another was actually in an ocean, and the next-to-last waited  patiently on Hagan 20, after a long, arduous stretch of  nothingness—the very edge of the Hagan system. Pilots were  expected to make one final revolution before heading to the last  checkpoint, a relatively simple marker erected amongst the wispy  rings of Hagan 16. The final segment was one long stretch of space  where pilots would ideally turn their engines to full throttle and  make one last dash for the finish.</p>
<p>Registering  for this grand event cost a pretty sum of 100,000 gold, but that was  “all expenses paid”, including hotel rooms, fueling and  maintenance, docking fees, and of course, ship and life insurance. A  first-place winner could expect to win a million in gold, while  second prize was 500,000, third was 250,000, and a consolation prize  of 100,000 went to fourth, so naturally there were people who  considered this race a good investment. Businesses promoted their  latest models of ships while other companies advertised new defensive  measures or more efficient fuel, and some went for the publicity  stunt angle. In summary, even though it was generally considered a  form of entertainment, many people took the Space Races very  seriously.</p>
<p>Most  of the women aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> could only put their faith in the skills of the Acheron sisters. Some,  like Herut, Kyrie, and all the aspiring chefs onboard, were  kept busy around the clock as they maintained both crew and ship, but  nearly everyone else just sat back and watched. Because the “Hagan  run” was so incredibly long, the race would go on for about five or  six days, maybe a week at most. This meant that broadcasts and  updates would be made every six hours or so, unless a “breaking  development” occurred; this also meant that the ship would be on  autopilot most of the time, or else handled in shifts.</p>
<p>The  topic of conversation for the ones left without a job focused mainly  on the competition. It seemed everybody onboard knew someone else in  the race—even Dr. Miracle herself was familiar with an adversary. Shana  told everyone about her encounter with the young Lord Demise,  and the general consensus was that he seemed cute, precocious,  energetic, but also quite bratty, and even a little perverted.</p>
<p>“I  didn’t get the impression that he was a sex fiend,” Shana  explained. “He was just…enthusiastic. Miss Miracle, what was  the name of that super-womanizing man in those novels?”</p>
<p>“You  mean Don Juan, or Casanova?”</p>
<p>“Casanova,  that’s the one. Lord Demise Jr. reminded me of Casanova.”</p>
<p>“Casanova’s  the author,” Amy muttered.</p>
<p>“It’s  no surprise Lord Naiis entered this race,” Aseria murmured. “He’s  a very capable pilot, and a good man. I’m more shocked they  actually dragged the <em>Einlanzer  3</em> all the way out here.”</p>
<p>“Why’s  that?”</p>
<p>“Well,  as I explained earlier, I have command of the <em>Einlanzer  7</em>,  which is an excellent vessel in its own right. Only six ships in the  entire Sindarin fleet are superior—the first is His Excellency’s  flagship, and the second belongs to Supreme Commander Vianos. But  the third is Admiral Qelbryn’s personal ship, and he’s not  exactly a generous man. Very strange.”</p>
<p>“This  is why we don’t discuss politics in the bedroom,” Lil groaned—“Or  anywhere else,” she added under her breath.</p>
<p>“Well,  Mink and I also saw several familiar faces, if anybody cares, the <em>Opportune  Rain</em> lives up to its reputation and its name, it takes every opportunity  it can find and leaves its </p>
<p>enemies  in the dust, we only use it for matters of extreme urgency, I see the  Vicegerent really wants to win this race, and he’s using old Hetz,  now that’s a pilot, a very capable man, the <em>Rain</em> bends itself to his will and leaves no room for rivals, hmm, I’m  starting to grow worrisome for <em>our</em> side now.”</p>
<p>“There’s  also the <em>Kemosabe</em>,”  Mink added quietly. “Do you remember that ship, Master? Miss  Yeriman was very…nice.” Mink genuinely smiled for the first time  since anyone could remember, and there was even a splash of red on  her gray cheeks. Rebecca perked up and wedged her head between them,  eyes wide with interest.</p>
<p>“Wow,  so you two know Satine as well? What a coincidence! She and I are  old friends! We did a job together on New Manhattan with my aunt  Shandra! I’ll introduce her if we ever meet up at one of these  checkpoints. We should really catch up on old times!”</p>
<p>“An  old crush?” Yenae teased. Rebecca rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“No,  moron, we were just friends. I’m not her type, anyway. I bet she  really poured over the charm on you, Mink.” The taciturn Yun  didn’t answer, but her smile widened and her cheeks turned just a  bit redder. Valti wriggled her arms in the air to wave away the  mushiness before it got out of control.</p>
<p>“Anyway,  it’s no surprise to see Rose’s gang here, or the Rennai slave  ship. I still count my lucky stars I was never forced to fly one of  those things. They say that if you make it in the top four during  the race, you get your freedom, but so far, not a single slave ship  has accomplished this. It’s not for lack of talent, though, I’ll  say that much.”</p>
<p>“And  how did you escape?” Kyrie wondered. “Hell, you never even told <em>me!</em> Why don’t you reveal your marvelous getaway right here and now?”</p>
<p>“Why  don’t you go cool that cute little head off?” she countered  smugly. Kate shoved them both aside before a fight (or a lover’s  quarrel) could break out.</p>
<p>“Okay,  ladies, that’ll be enough. Kay and Tee have enough to worry about  without you rocking the boat.”</p>
<p>“Hey,  that’s right!” Shana exclaimed loudly. “There’s a Heavyworld  guy in this race! Do you know him, Katie?”</p>
<p>“I’ve  never heard of him,” she answered. “Brigadoon is one of the  nicer heavy-G worlds. What about you, Naja? You’re a seasoned  traveler, and you got us into this.” Naja was quietly watching the  broadcast, too fixated on the updates to even answer. She was really  getting into it, too: she laughed and spat whenever the <em>Dauntless</em> passed somebody, and cursed when it fell behind. The snake-woman let  out one particularly memorable wail as the announcers pointed out the  Elshyrin ship’s progress: it had gotten an early lead and was  close to the first checkpoint.</p>
<p>“Score  one for my people!! YAHOO!! All right! Sock it to em’, girl! Let’s show these stinkin’ mammals what a cold-hearted bitch can  do! YES!”</p>
<p>“I’m  almost afraid to ask,” Yenae muttered. Naja forced herself away  from the simulcast and cackled for glee.</p>
<p>“Heh,  take a look at THAT, why don’t’cha? If we weren’t lagging  behind that rotten bitch, I might even be in a better mood! I still  don’t get why they chose Yrhol of all people to steer that bucket  of bolts, but who cares? A bad Elshyrin is still better than a good  shaved ape, eh Lily?!” She cackled louder than before and resumed  watching. Lil smiled humbly and tried to act cool as all eyes fell  on her.</p>
<p>“Uh,  yeah, Naja and I sort of became close pals. Well, she really likes  Aseria too, so maybe great minds do attract each other.”</p>
<p>“More  like psycho nutcases!” Fuuka screamed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yeah,  that’s right!” Alala shouted. “And anyway, the magnificent  Fai-Lynn will defeat them all! The <em>Colonel  Lingus</em> may start out slow, but it builds up momentum until it releases  itself in a frantic burst!”</p>
<p>Several  people snickered; they couldn’t keep it in. Not even Yenae could  be civil after hearing that remark.</p>
<p>“Honey,  that…that’s a really interesting choice of words.”</p>
<p>“What? I’m just saying that the <em>Colonel  Lingus</em> can pound its competition into submission! It keeps coming and  coming until it blasts right through, and all you’re left with is a  stunned sensation!”</p>
<p>The  snickering became louder. Alala wiggled her ears in confusion.</p>
<p>“What?! What’s with you all? I’m totally serious here!”</p>
<p>“Maybe  you’d  better stop right now, sweetie,” Yenae chuckled. “I  think they got the message.” While everyone was still laughing at  Alala’s unintended innuendo, three women were deep in thought,  their minds awhirl with speculation and concern as they thought about  the rest of their opponents. Lyara had instantly recognized the name  of her bitter rival when the visitors from Avatar were announced: she  and Asara had fought each other fiercely for control of the Night  Hammers—and nearly all of Avatar itself—and she greatly feared  another confrontation. All that she could hope for was that they  would not meet around any of the docks, hotels, or checkpoints, and  that nobody would say her name out loud.</p>
<p>Eve  Kasberry was no less concerned. She too had picked out a familiar  name from the crowd, but it was neither enemy nor friend, merely a  former client. Hearing Kaori Chuunaru’s name really took her back,  and she wondered if the other woman would remember her—or the  bounty the UCM put on her head. Eve had helped construct the  prototype Damascus body armor that was customized for Kaori alone,  and she hoped this single act of goodwill would save her from being  dragged back into that prison. Knowing Kaori’s fanatical loyalty  and adherence to justice, probably not.</p>
<p>Riene  Latoli was actually throwing words around in her head. She  immediately identified <em>Der  Fliegende Hollander</em>,  a homage to the infamous ghost ship “The Flying Dutchman”, but  was more concerned for the name Nemo Nephele, who was sponsoring the <em>Backdraft</em>. Her extensive study in languages led her to understand that not  everything was as it seemed, and several names that seemed ordinary  at first really had different meanings. In all likeliness, it  probably was just a silly coincidence, but it kept nagging her even  as the conversation diverted and the <em>Dauntless</em> gradually crept towards the first checkpoint.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Long  hours passed, or seemed to pass at any rate. The <em>Dauntless</em> had just left Hagan 10 and would be entering the dust cloud that  shielded the ninth world and the first checkpoint. Aside from being  tossed around by several glory hogs early on, the ship hadn’t met  any other competitors during the race, and as far as anybody could  tell, they were all alone in the universe, </p>
<p>floating  in a vast ocean of stars that was neither cold nor crushing, but  beautiful and strange, and so achingly familiar at times, like the  womb of a mother. Sometimes music would come pouring through even  when all radios were silenced and there was not another ship around  for miles. It was not melodic or rhythmic like the sounds the crew  was accustomed to: it was more like hearing a very faint wind chime  tolling as a lazy breeze whispered to it. Amy Miracle stood up  spontaneously as the eerie sounds drifted, and she removed her  glasses and stood petrified, listening in fearful joy.</p>
<p>“They’re  here too,” she murmured to herself. Fuuka chastised her for  standing up without support and gave Amy her cane, but she wasn’t  paying attention. Miracle now seemed to be on the same plane as the  music itself, and only turned to Fuuka when she felt the good doctor  tugging her sleeve.</p>
<p>“You’re  bleeding through your bandages!” she exclaimed quietly. Amy  gingerly drew back from her mysterious daze and offered a timid  smile.</p>
<p>“Yes,  you’re right. Fuji-san, did you see her as well? Did you hear  what she had to say? Never mind—you don’t know what I’m  talking about…and I can’t explain it. The words can’t fit into  it.”</p>
<p>“What  do you—“ Before anybody could say anything else, the PA system  came on with a transmission from outside.</p>
<p>“Greetings, <em>Dauntless</em>! I’m glad I was able to catch up to you! There are lots of famous  ships in this race, but not very many you could really call  legendary.”</p>
<p>“I  know that voice,” said Mink, blossoming into animation as if  springtime had erupted all around her. Rebecca smiled tightly and  picked up a transmitter.</p>
<p>“So  do I. Hello there, Satine! It’s been awhile, hasn’t it?” There was a slight pause as the other pilot began recalling that  familiar voice.</p>
<p>“Becky? Rebecca Hill?! What the heck are you doing on that ship?! Don’t  tell me you’re part of the crew! Of all the… I…I can’t even  speak, I’m too excited! I…I’m flabbergasted!”</p>
<p>“Calm  down. I’m sorry to surprise you like that, but you deserved it for  sneaking up on us.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  wow!” Satine exclaimed. “I can’t believe it! I haven’t seen  you since we did that job back on New Manhattan, and now you’re  working with Dr. Miracle! Tell me, Becky, what’s he like?”</p>
<p>“Irritated,”  Amy grunted. Yenae laughed warmly and rubbed her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Anonymity  hasn’t been very kind to you, has it?” Rebecca struggled for  awhile with the proper answer.</p>
<p>“Let’s  just say that Dr. Miracle was…unexpected. So what’s happened to  you all this time? We’ve got some catching up to do.” In  response, the <em>Kemosabe</em> inched a little closer, trying to prove its abilities against the  legendary vessel.</p>
<p>“Let’s  save the socializing for later, huh? I want to see what the <em>Dauntless</em> is made of! Let’s have a contest—a friendly one, of course. What do you say? Last one to reach the checkpoint buys the loser  dinner.” Rebecca took a moment to weight the decision, mostly  because she was trying not to be so impulsive. That kind of attitude  had made her unpopular when she first signed on. The “champion of  justice” in her had wanted to capture all the bounties lounging  around, but the rationalist told her to step closer a little, look at  things carefully, and make judgments based on fact, not hearsay. She  had changed since, and was more prudent about things, but as  described earlier, it was only a moment’s thought.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Floor  it!!” The <em>Dauntless</em> immediately reacted to her decision and sped up drastically, nearly  throwing everyone to their feet from the acceleration. It surged  ahead of the <em>Kemosabe</em> and her impressed pilot for about a minute before Yeriman caught up.</p>
<p>“Whew!”  she whistled. “That was quite a bold move there, Becks. You  haven’t changed much since Manhattan: you’re still as impulsive  as ever.”</p>
<p>“You  know how New Year’s resolutions go,” she answered cheerily. The  two ships flew neck and neck for another three minutes before the <em>Kemosabe</em> fell behind. Their rival was quicker and more maneuverable, but it  suffered when it came to momentum. This wasn’t quite the root of  Satine’s problem, though.</p>
<p>“Aw,  phooey, we ran right into that dust field! The good news is that  we’re close to the checkpoint, but the bad news is that I have to  raise my shields so I don’t get pummeled. It really steams me that  my speed is compensated so sharply, but I’m not ramming into  something without protection!”</p>
<p>“That’s  what he said,” Chandra chuckled.</p>
<p>“We  never have to worry about that,” Kyrie squealed. “We’ve got an  Orihalcum alloy! Dust and debris are no problem to us! Sorry, but  it looks like you’ll be buying us dinner! Sucks to be you!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  count me out yet,” Satine swore. “Hmm, Orihalcum, you say? Sheesh, Hill, what kind of elbows are you rubbing with?”</p>
<p>“Uh,  just about every kind,” she murmured, taking a cursory look at the  crew. The dusty cloud lasted for another minute or two before both  ships were cleared. Satine lowered her shields and hit the  accelerator, taking a brief lead once more.</p>
<p>“She’s  certainly a worthy opponent,” Riene observed.</p>
<p>“Ah  yes, but an even worthier employer, she did a real bang-up job for  me, yes, put some real gold in my purse, I’d have to hire her again  sometime soon, hmm, but not now, not yet, yes, and she’d probably  want to talk to Mink for awhile, those two became good friends, I  don’t suppose she eats very heavily, you know, because we’ll have  to honor our wager if she keeps this speed up.”</p>
<p>“She  won’t,”  Herut stated as she stared at the observation monitors. “I know that  model very well. She was only able to get ahead of us  because her thrust is state-of-the-art, plus she has excellent  handling and maneuverability. She’d win hands down if we were  caught in an asteroid field. But this is a straight run until the  checkpoint, so we have momentum on our side. You learn this sort of  thing after working on a few vessels.” Sure as she said, Satine’s  ship started to lag behind as the <em>Dauntless</em> continued its run. It was the difference between a marathon runner  and a sprinter: one just wore itself out too quickly. Satine sighed  over the radio, almost ready to admit defeat.</p>
<p>“Well,  it looks like you’ve almost beaten me. I guess that dinner’s  yours, Becky, unless something drastic happens. I, uh, hope your  whole crew doesn’t take advantage of my charity!”</p>
<p>“No,  just a quiet drink between friends is all I ask.” A few women let  out a gushy sigh—“Awwww!”—but thank goodness for the Acheron  sisters and their objective outlook.</p>
<p>“Sorry  to interrupt this tender moment, but we’re approaching three other  ships. We’ve identified them as the <em>Opportune  Rain</em>,  the <em>Screaming  Skull</em>,  and the <em>Domination</em>. It seems they’ve slowed down and might be in need of assistance.”</p>
<p>“Aw,  fuck!!” Naja screeched. “I don’t know whether to pull over or  to kick them when they’re down! Urrgh, who knew I’d ever have  mixed feelings over anything? Do we squash or do we save? Squash,  save, squash, save!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Maybe  we should let the girl scout handle it,” Eve muttered. It didn’t  seem to matter what anybody else wanted, because the Acheron sisters  were slowing down to investigate. Ultimately, control of the ship  was theirs. The <em>Opportune</em> Rain darted out before the <em>Dauntless</em> could decelerate much; the <em>Skull</em> and <em>Domination</em> jumped into action, sandwiching the other ship between them. They  might have just been lagging behind by accident, but this could also  have been a tactic of theirs, and there was little the Acherons could  do since this kind of aggression was allowed (as a matter of fact,  rescue vehicles often employed this very tactic during a race to  secure handicapped vessels).</p>
<p>“What  are they doing?” Kay whispered.</p>
<p>“They’re  not letting us get ahead,” Tee murmured doubtfully. “If we  decelerate…oh no.” The twins hissed in annoyance as the <em>Opportune  Rain</em> released a ballast, covering the ship’s bow with a thick, dark  substance—blinding all monitors and visual equipment.</p>
<p>“The  little cheaters!!” Kyrie screamed. Yenae sighed and flipped  through a race rulebook she had picked up (being the meticulous  type).</p>
<p>“Actually,  that measure isn’t against the rules,” she murmured. “Ships  flying around dump all kinds of dust and debris by accident; nobody  can help it. And of course, it’s impossible to prove they did that  on purpose since I’m sure Miss Yeriman back there is enjoying a bit  of cloud cover herself, courtesy of this very same ship.”</p>
<p>“It’s  not filthy, you know,” Herut snapped. Yenae chuckled darkly and  ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>“Space  is a dirty place, kid.”</p>
<p>“So  what should we do, doc?” Eve mumbled. Amy was staring off in a  daze again, but this time it seemed she was at least partially aware  of the situation.</p>
<p>“Activate  the windshield wipers? We’ll be fine. I’m sure—“</p>
<p>“<em>Dauntless</em>,  do  you copy? I think you’d better brace yourselves for an attack! I’m  picking up another vessel coming in from behind—not able to  ID yet. They’re not responding to me and I don’t think they’ll  listen to you, either! Maybe I can slow them down.” Amy suddenly  sprang into action, literally leaping out of her funk, sans crutch,  and gaining firm command of the situation.</p>
<p>“Miss  Yeriman, what’s going on outside? We’re surrounded by two other  ships, and another one is directly ahead of us. We’re also flying  blind for the moment. Wait—we should still be able to use some  equipment! Kay, Tee, are our sensors being jammed as well?”</p>
<p>“Copy!”</p>
<p>“It’s  taking everything we have not to dash ourselves against those other  two!” Amy nodded as a visual picture of their situation entered  her mind.</p>
<p>“Which  probably means they’ve slowed us down—but then that other ship  will catch up. Our opponents are very tricky people. Miss Yeriman,  are you still there?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  go ahead.”</p>
<p>“Contact  the race officials and tell them we’re under attack. Have you been  able to stop that other ship?”</p>
<p>“No,  and I still can’t ID them. Sorry, guys: I failed. It flew right  by me.”</p>
<p>“All  right, stay with us and get in touch with the officials. These three  ships aren’t doing anything particularly harmful, but if we’re  attacked…”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  I know. WATCH IT!!”</p>
<p>“Oh,  dear—HANG ON!” Nobody was spared as the unknown ship rammed the <em>Dauntless</em> from behind. The whole world jolted fiercely, and whatever wasn’t  fastened down tight was sent flying, people and effects and  everything in between. Amy Miracle had a death-</p>
<p>grip  on some railing and only got the wind knocked out of her as she was  thrust right into it; Rachel sprang into action suddenly and saved a  few people from seriously injuring themselves: invisible fingers  pulled and pushed to soften the blow.</p>
<p>“Some  race, huh?” she squealed. More than one infuriated finger stabbed  in her direction; the general consensus was that the mystical entity  “do something and help out”. But she just scratched her head and  gave a lopsided frown. “But I did do something, didn’t I? Fuji-san won’t have to mend any broken bones thanks to me, right?”</p>
<p>“Not  quite what we meant,” Aseria grumbled. She decided to take matters  into her own hands and barked at the <em>Kemosabe</em>. “All right, miss girl scout, it’s up to you. Before we get  smashed again, I think you should—“</p>
<p>“We’ve  identified the aggressive ship!” Kay shouted from the bridge. “It’s marked as the <em>Backdraft</em>! Communication hasn’t been established yet, but I’m sure—“</p>
<p>“Look  out!” Satine shouted. Amy groaned.</p>
<p>“Not  again.” Fortunately, Rachel was in the very thick of things and  deftly summoned an army of cushions to soften the numerous falls and  bruises. It looked as if all she had to do was wave her hands, or  wink, or clap, or perform some other silly act—but a careful  observer would see that her lips were moving almost imperceptibly,  and if everybody hadn’t been roaring and yelling, they might have  heard the faintest whisper of chanting coming from her. Riene, who  was nearest to the genie when the <em>Dauntless</em> settled down, plainly heard her say “we owe you” in Hebrew, but  couldn’t make anything out of it.</p>
<p>Aseria  snarled something sharp and melodic that only three other people  understood—clearly a Sindar curse—then composed herself and  resumed her train of thought. “As I was saying, girl scout, I’d  advise you to fire a sonic disruptor blast on one of the two ships  surrounding us. If you’re incapable of that, we’ll just have to  force our friend here to act.” She glared icily at Rachel, who was  too busy helping her master stand up. A sound came from Satine’s  end of the line that indicated no such action would be required.</p>
<p>“Golly,  why didn’t I think of that before? I’m actually in range right  now. Are you sure you don’t want me to hit that other one?”</p>
<p>“No: these two could crush us if you strike the aggressor. Just free us  and we’ll handle the rest.”</p>
<p>“All  right, which should I strike? I don’t have much juice left, so I  only have one blast.”</p>
<p>“The <em>Screaming  Skull</em>!”  Naja shrieked.</p>
<p>“The <em>Domination</em>!”  Valti yelled. Rebecca smacked her face with her hand.</p>
<p>“Surprise  us!!” Satine smirked doggedly as she locked her sights and fired: she never did like those pompous Elshyrin. The <em>Domination</em> quickly lost all power as the sonic disruptor briefly debilitated its  energy, leaving it to helplessly float out of control until the  effects wore off. Naja snarled and balled her fists in anger, and  attacked anyone who tried assuring her that the arriving race  officials would help out. Valti sighed in relief as the <em>Dauntless</em> stepped out of confinement and made a break for it. Vimmy shouted  for the <em>Opportune  Rain</em> to stand aside, while the rest of the crew settled for cheers and  hugs. Rebecca smiled and picked up the radio transmitter one more  time.</p>
<p>“Thanks,  Sati. It looks like we owe <em>you</em> one now.”</p>
<p>“Let’s  just  call it even,” she chuckled. “But maybe we can both settle  down and catch up on old times at the first checkpoint. I might take  a bit longer, though. That shot really drained my reserves.” Rebecca  smiled warmly, and wondered how she could ever repay her old  partner. </p>
<p>They  had never actually been very close, so this was almost like asking a  stranger to stick her neck out for them.</p>
<p>“Really,  Sati, if there’s anything we can do…”</p>
<p>“What’s  that? I…n’t copy! I think… some static…ference! …breaking… Going out…range! I’ll meet…the check…and don’t…”</p>
<p>“Sati? Sati, are you there? Is something wrong? Hey, I—“</p>
<p>“She’s  too far away now,” Aseria said in a steely voice. She was aware  that the fight was only just beginning, that the <em>Dauntless</em> still had at least two more cutthroat opponents in this race even if  the authorities did appear, and they couldn’t rest on their laurels  or hand out congratulations just yet. They were given a reprieve as  a race official chased the <em>Backdraft</em> away; the <em>Rain</em> and <em>Skull</em> hung back casually until they were gone, then fiercely made up for  lost time and started harassing the women.</p>
<p>“I  guess  we’ve got no choice but to trust those freaks,” Lil cursed  as she strapped herself in. Amy hit the emergency “fasten all  safety belts” switch and the crew hunkered down as best they could. It  was time for the Acheron sisters to show them what they were  really made of.</p>
<p>“Well,  two down and two to go,” Kay whispered. The grime had been wiped  away, all jamming frequency had stopped, and the ship was no longer  under direct attack, but their opponents weren’t about to be left  behind, and struggled fiercely to beat the <em>Dauntless</em> to the checkpoint. Only one ship could legally go through at a time,  and all racers were required to run through them in exact order, so  it would be a tight finish. Herut, Kyrie, and Eve busied themselves  with improving communication so they could get in touch with Satine  again; the others were praying, waiting on edge for the excitement to  reach its apex.</p>
<p>“The <em>Opportune  Rain</em> is everything Vimmy said it was,” Tee observed, “but at least  it’s not cheating. The <em>Screaming  Skull’s</em> not doing too bad, either. I guess all those criminals are desperate  to win. We’re setting the bar awfully high this time, sister. Let’s just hope we can jump over it.” Kay smiled confidently and  pushed the vessel even further.</p>
<p>“Anything  the <em>Zephyr</em> can do, we can do better!”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>It  had been an incredibly close finish: the <em>Dauntless</em> narrowly slipped through the checkpoint just seconds after the <em>Opportune  Rain</em>,  but the Norgrim envoy had spent most of its reserves accelerating at  such a fast pace, while the <em>Dauntless</em> still had plenty of fight left. The <em>Screaming  Skull</em> fell behind, and once it was cleared, it immediately began descending  to Hagan 9 for repairs and refueling. The <em>Rain</em> followed it, victorious but exhausted, while the <em>Dauntless</em> casually settled into port. The crew had about thirty minutes to  walk around and stretch their legs before the <em>Kemosabe</em> showed up.</p>
<p>Satine  Yeriman turned out to be part human and part Inu, a race loosely  related to sentient canines; the furry ears, sharply pointed nose,  and tail were strong giveaways. In this respect, perhaps, she and  Alala were quite similar, and when Satine first saw her, she ran up  and greeted her quite warmly. Alala bristled at first—she  remembered a particularly fiendish encounter with a Rodere, a  mouse-person—but Satine was as gregarious and playful and loyal as  any of her breed, and she was one of the many that liked cats (and  Felinis). She was a good-natured and outgoing woman—not  necessarily cheery, just warm and friendly—and she was </p>
<p>flirty,  too, though she tended to focus on quieter people. This was probably  why Mink waited so patiently to speak with her, and why she seemed a  little more emotional when her chance finally came.</p>
<p>In  the end, Satine (who usually went by “Sati”) really didn’t have  that much to say to her old friend, and once their stories were told,  she gradually shifted to the rest of the crew. She connected with  Mink quite well, and to Rebecca’s envy, became <em>very</em> friendly with Riene during the time they spent at that rest stop. This  was really the first time anybody consciously sought out Riene  and flirted with her—even Chandra had an excuse for being  indiscriminate. Rebecca felt stricken, but she was too embarrassed  and too unsure of herself to say anything—and besides, she  considered Sati a friend even if they really didn’t know each other  that well.</p>
<p>“So  where’s Dr. Miracle?” Sati asked once her conversation with Riene  reached a standstill. She stuck her long, cute nose in the air and  sniffed; Alala wiggled her ears and growled jealously. Amy was  acting like her usual nondescript self to the very end; she didn’t  even bat an eye when Sati came her way. Naja wanted to avenge her  fallen Elshyrin, so she didn’t say anything, but luckily there was  more than one blabbermouth onboard.</p>
<p>“This  is the woman you’re looking for!” Amy’s face turned red as  Chandra grabbed her from behind and squeezed her tummy. “Believe  it or not,” she announced sensually, “this unfashionable bookworm  with the limp is our little miracle-worker.”</p>
<p>“No  way!” Sati screamed. “Are you telling me Dr. Miracle’s a  brunette?!”</p>
<p>KER-PLOP!!</p>
<p>“Get  up,” Athena sighed as she nudged Fuuka. “This isn’t one of  your animes.”</p>
<p>“Heheh,  sorry.”</p>
<p><em><u>Preview  of next chapter:</u></em></p>
<p>Kate: Hey, what happened? Why am I being left out of all this? Everyone  else gets to do something cool, and here I am stuck with “the  others”.</p>
<p>Allegra: Face it, hon: the chopped liver club is a small, lonely group.</p>
<p>Lyara: You two are nothing more than a gimmick. Shards of my personal  back-story are finally being brought forth. I am now officially a  third-dimensional character!</p>
<p>Kate: I ran away from home. There, back-story finished! Now can we  PLEASE get on with my character arc? I need to do something that  will define me as a person, not some muscle-bound stereotype!</p>
<p>Lyara: Like enter into an unrequited love spiral as you fruitlessly pine  for Allegra?</p>
<p>Allegra: WHAT!?</p>
<p>Kate: What?! No, I…I really don’t… W-we’re just friends! She…she trusts me, and I trust her, and… (But now that you  mention it, I <em>have</em> been paying more attention to her recently!)</p>
<p>Allegra: Thank goodness this ain’t got nothin’ to do with the next  chapter! I hear that polecat Derian’s up to no good again. This  time, he might even be teaming up with somebody for his next attack!</p>
<p>Lyara: We already saw him do that.</p>
<p>Allegra: But this time, he’s doin’ it with people we know!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Kate: Gasp and alarm! Will old friends turn against us? Will new enemies  spring forth from the rafters? And will my unrequited love spiral be  anything but?</p>
<p>Allegra: Your “spiral” is makin’ me dizzy, hon! It’s all in the next  chapter, “Space Race: where decisions are made”.</p>
<p>Lyara: Don’t lose your lunch, all right? I just cleaned up in here.</p>
<p>Kate: But somebody definitely gets laid in the next chapter! My god, it  could be any one of us!</p>
<p>Allegra: Even Amy?!</p>
<p>Kate: Okay, it could be a “few” of us.</p>
<p>Lyara: This preview has now officially…CROSSED THE LINE!</p>
<p>Allegra  and Kate: (clutching each other) Scary!!</p>
