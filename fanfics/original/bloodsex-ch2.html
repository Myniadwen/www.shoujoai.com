<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        The sun had just set behind the towers of the city when the 
bell hung above the door rang out into the quiet. Jess turned from 
where she was cleaning her instruments in a basin, watching the tall, 
pale woman looking about her curiously.

        &quot;Welcome,&quot; Jess said as she scooped up a towel to dry off her 
hands. She looked at the woman thoughtfully before adding, &quot;I&#39;m sorry 
to say I may not be able to help you.&quot;

        &quot;Why not?&quot; the woman asked curiously, her dark hair and eyes 
in stark relief against her almost paper white skin.

        Jess smiled grimly, &quot;My techniques would do you great harm, 
creature of the night.&quot;

        &quot;You know what I am,&quot; a toothy smile, &quot;you&#39;re reputation isn&#39;t 
undeserved, Ms. Drake. But I didn&#39;t want to hire you for my sake.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Jess raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;I want you to work on my lover,&quot; the vampire explained 
quietly.

        Jess raised an elegant eyebrow, &quot;Interesting.&quot; She gestured to 
where the shop&#39;s sign hung, &quot;You know my name. What&#39;s yours?&quot;

        &quot;Susan,&quot; the vampire said softly, &quot;and my love is Erin.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s take this into the back,&quot; Jess said, pushing through 
the curtain and leading her into the back room, &quot;I don&#39;t usually 
discuss business like this out here.&quot; She opened up a small fridge, 
pulling out a bottle and offered, &quot;Ginger ale?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Susan smiled at Jess&#39; surprised look. &quot;We can drink 
most fluids, it&#39;s the solid foods that are a problem,&quot; she explained. 
She sniffed the air, and an odd look appeared on her face, &quot;There was 
blood shed here.&quot;

        &quot;This is where I work,&quot; Jess agreed. She took a drink of her 
ginger ale, &quot;So what do you want me to do for her, exactly?&quot;

        Susan looked down uncomfortably, her voice husky as she said, 
&quot;I want you to give her a protective charm against all vampires.&quot;

        &quot;All vampires,&quot; Jess echoed, &quot;even yourself?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Susan said softly.

        Jess mused over that for a few moments before saying, &quot;I&#39;ll 
need to talk with her about this before I do anything, I hope you 
understand.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Susan nodded. She smiled slightly, &quot;Erin works in 
a cafe in the city, on the night shift. I&#39;m certain we can speak to 
her on her break.&quot;

        It was close enough to her regular closing time that Jess felt 
no qualms about leaving early. The doors were locked normally, then 
Jess laid her hand on the front window. The word was harsh, in a 
language unknown to man, and magic flared to life all around the shop.

        At Susan&#39;s questioning look Jess smiled grimly, &quot;Let&#39;s just 
say that anyone attempting to break in will regret it, dearly.&quot;

        They walked off together silently in the twilight, two near 
strangers out together. Jess wondered if any others recognized the 
vampire walking there beside her, but she rather doubted it. People 
could rationalize almost anything they saw, explaining away the darkly 
supernatural things that they might have encountered.

        Reaching the cafe was almost a relief, a bright colored island 
in the near darkness. Waitresses worked the packed tables, the scent 
of savory food wafting towards them both. Jess looked at the girls, a 
beautiful blonde, sultry redhead, and other beauties, and wondered who 
this Erin was.

        &quot;She works in the kitchen,&quot; Susan smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll go 
ask one of the waitresses to let her know I&#39;m here.&quot;

        As Susan walked off Jess smiled wryly, &#39;There goes that 
theory.&#39; The woman that Susan came back with a short time later wasn&#39;t 
classically beautiful. Short brown hair was pulled back in a ponytail, 
her brown eyes were behind comfortable glasses, and she was a bit 
lanky. But none of that mattered for when she gazed at Susan, she was 
transformed by the love in her eyes.

        &quot;You must be the artist Susan told me about,&quot; Erin offered her 
hand.

        &#39;Artist, I like the sound of that,&#39; Jess thought even as she 
shook the lady&#39;s hand, &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Erin.&quot;

        Susan stepped close to Erin, pulling her into a gentle hug. 
&quot;It&#39;s good to see you love,&quot; she said softly. She released her quite 
reluctantly, &quot;Could we go somewhere private to talk?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s a place out back,&quot; Erin lead them around the 
building. A table had been set up for the employees there, now empty. 
&quot;Grab a seat,&quot; she smiled.

        Erin and Susan sat side by side, while Jess chose to sit 
across from the two of them. &quot;Jess is the one I&#39;ve asked to put the 
protective charm on you,&quot; Susan explained to Erin softly.

        &quot;Right, the charm,&quot; Erin echoed a bit uncomfortably.

        Jess met Erin&#39;s eyes for a moment before saying to Susan, 
&quot;Would it be all right if I talk to Erin alone?&quot; Susan looked a bit 
surprised so she added, &quot;We&#39;re going to need to talk about what sort 
of tattoo she wants, the design and all. And I suspect she wants it to 
be a surprise.&quot;

        Erin nodded firmly, and Susan smiled wryly, &quot;All right, my 
love. I&#39;ll go onto the restaurant for a while, come get me when you&#39;re 
ready.&quot; She bent over, kissed Erin on the cheek, and was gone.

        &quot;You don&#39;t want this protective charm done, do you?&quot; Jess 
asked Erin softly.

        &quot;No,&quot; Erin sighed. &quot;I only went along with it because she was 
so worried about hurting me,&quot; a wry smile, &quot;I don&#39;t seem to be able to 
get across that I don&#39;t mind the idea.&quot;

        &quot;You do understand,&quot; Jess said softly, &quot;that for a vampire, 
their sexuality is all tied up with their bite and the drinking of the 
partner&#39;s blood. If you and she intend to consummate the relationship, 
you have to be ready.&quot;

        Erin was blushing furiously, &quot;I know, and I want to.&quot;

        Jess looked over at the lady thoughtfully. It was a rare 
thing, to run into two people so in love this way. Both so willing to 
sacrifice, one giving up her needs to protect, the other eagerly 
willing to give herself up to the other.

        Jess smiled slightly, &quot;Then let&#39;s see what we can do to change 
Susan&#39;s mind.&quot; Erin looked at her in surprise as Jess leaned forward, 
&quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;ll do...&quot;

        Susan paced the dark apartment, she had been waiting for over 
an hour for Erin to return. She knew what she was going to loose, 
but... The love that she was able to give to Erin could kill her. It 
was better, if Erin were protected. She would bear it, no matter what 
happened.

        The door opened with a soft click, and Erin came inside. She 
was dressed in T-shirt and jeans, and a bandage was on her upper left 
arm. After stopping a moment to remove her socks and shoes at the door 
she smiled at Susan and softly said, &quot;It&#39;s done.&quot;

        Susan kept her distance as she softly said, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        Erin walked across the room to her side, &quot;Could you help me 
take the bandage off, please?&quot;

        Susan reached out a hand to gently lay on Erin&#39;s arm, sliding 
it up to the edge of the bandage. She peeled the tape up gently, then 
cautiously pulled the bandage away from the tattoo. She looked down at 
the image, and her eyes widened.

        It was a simple design, really. Two rings of gold, 
interlocking, and written inside each ring was a name. Susan, one of 
them read, and inside the other was Erin, both separate yet connected 
by the two rings of gold.

        &quot;This isn&#39;t,&quot; Susan said wonderingly as she looked into Erin&#39;s 
eyes.

        &quot;Jess made me what I wanted,&quot; Erin said softly. She stepped in 
close to the vampire, looking up at her with love and trust in her 
eyes, &quot;Will you give me what we both want?&quot;

        Susan took her by the shoulders as she quietly confessed, &quot;I 
guess I just didn&#39;t understand.&quot;

        They kissed, at first gently, then more fiercely. Erin pulled 
free a moment, swiftly pulling her shirt off, revealing she wasn&#39;t 
wearing a bra. The pants were swiftly unbuttoned, dropping in a pile 
to the floor, leaving her entirely nude.

        &quot;I wanted you when I was under the needle,&quot; Erin murmured as 
she stepped into Susan&#39;s arms again, shivering slightly at the chill 
of Susan&#39;s skin but finding it erotic none the less, &quot;I wanted you 
back at the restaurant.&quot;

        &quot;And I wanted you,&quot; Susan murmured, shuddering as she felt the 
heat of Erin&#39;s form, &quot;I was just scared of hurting you.&quot;

        &quot;There is nothing that could happen here,&quot; Erin smiled 
contentedly, &quot;that I wouldn&#39;t want.&quot;

        Susan drew them both down to the couch, laying Erin down there 
gently. She stroked the shoulders, then down to cup small but 
sensitive breasts. The nipples hardened under cold fingers, and Erin 
gasped as a raspy tongue stroked them like a cat. Gentle fingers slid 
down a curved belly, finding the shaved triangle and sliding into 
sweet wetness. With a wicked smile Susan stroked in and out, enjoying 
the cries she was bringing from her lady.

        Susan brought her lips to Erin&#39;s ear, &quot;Ready?&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Erin whimpered.

        With a single smooth motion white fangs were buried into the 
curve of a breast, and Erin screamed out her pleasure...

        Jess closed up the shop once again for the night, smiling 
faintly. &#39;If Susan didn&#39;t get that message,&#39; she thought, &#39;then she&#39;s 
far dumber than she looks.&#39; She wondered if the two of them would make 
it, despite the odds against them. Still, Jess was hopeful...
