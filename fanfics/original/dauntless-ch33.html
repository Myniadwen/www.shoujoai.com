<p>“The Flawed Couple: someone please  come to rescue us!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The sun dawned slowly on the veldt  and unfurled long stretches of golden-orange light, setting fire to  the dew-dropped grass and invigorating life to the world once more. A  subtle song of locusts and crickets stirred, gently at first, as  warmth and light returned; the lavender sky broke into a shimmering  ginger radiance, and began to dance faintly. A wind picked up, giving  the orchestral insects flight, flinging moisture from the green field  into the air, spreading seeds across the fresh land as daybreak began  with all his promises. The last twinkling stars saluted their mighty  sovereign one last time before humbly fading back into the sky; the  world’s moon, virginal and pale like a bride pacing to meet her  groom, sunk deep into the womb of the earth, not to be seen until the  great chariot of fire had completed its circuit. Gradually, with eons  of patience supporting it, the sun climbed higher and higher, until  its massive sphere had at last broken free from the horizon, and  hovered proud in the clear sky.</p>
<p>Its rays of warmth stretched out far  and wide, removing shadows and uncovering secrets. One beam came to  rest upon a reclining figure, still asleep after her rough descent to  this world, casting its golden brightness on her soft, tanned skin.  Her triangular ears, curved and pointy like scimitars, flickered as  the early warmth caressed them; her great swirling tribal tattoos,  curling white like clouds tickling the sky, seemed to come alive as  her eyes fluttered open, bringing forth life to her body once more.  She knew she was in no pain, because her smoky-gray horns did not  ache, and her tail slithered up to greet her and examine the world  curiously. Yenae felt completely at ease, even though she had no idea  where she was or how she had gotten there. She did not even stir--and  soon discovered another reason to be still. Curled up directly in  front of her, nearly within reach of her gentle arms, was a beautiful  Felinis, sleeping sweetly.</p>
<p>Yenae’s face blossomed with marvel  and unquenchable love as she beheld the person most precious to her,  laying there asleep without a single care etched on her gorgeous  face. Her whiskers, imperceptible strands of pale gray traced on her  cheeks, waved at her in the breeze; silvery hair and fur rippled  gently, her limbs cozied up defensively, her eyes shut in a tranquil  dream. Alala had always been beautiful in Yenae’s eyes, but now she  looked like a child of angels, a cherub kitten descended from heaven  for her pleasure. Yenae’s eyes furrowed as tears began to form--the  mere sight of this exquisite being caused her to weep in rapture--and  she snuggled close so she could hear her breathing. What an  entrancing lady…and those cute, pouting lips of hers were so close,  opened just slightly as she slept… Yenae fell in love all over, and  could no longer restrain herself as she moved closer, gently placing  her mouth over those sweet pink flowers.</p>
<p>Of course, as any fairy tale will  tell you, the princess always wakes up after a kiss, and this was no  exception. Alala had teetered on that dreamy border between fully  asleep and fully awake until she felt a soft, sweet sensation  encompassing her, and stirred as gently as a cloud stirs in the quiet  breeze. Through her haze, she felt <em>something</em> pressed up  against her lips, and her eyes slowly opened to see what this was.  The discovery was instantly sobering, like a slap of icy water, and  she realized with infuriation and terror that Yenae had finally  crossed the line.</p>
<p></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“WWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>She vaulted to her feet and stumbled  away, screaming so loud that it disturbed a flock of birds and made  several trees drop their fruit prematurely. The sky itself seemed to  wince as Alala backed off, tripped, stuttered, fell on her bottom,  cursed, babbled, and pointed sharply. She <em>may</em> have  overreacted.</p>
<p>“YOU <em>KISSED</em> ME!! WHAT IN  THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT FOR?! WHAT SORT OF WACKO IDEAS CREPT INTO  THAT EMPTY HEAD OF YOURS THAT MADE YOU…<em>DO</em> THAT?! I CAN’T  BELIEVE YOU…YOU…YOU <em>KISSED</em> ME!!”</p>
<p>“Well, good morning, my little  sweet potato,” Yenae purred, clawing the air playfully. “What a  delightful way to start my day--mmm, yummy!”</p>
<p>“That’s disgusting!” Alala  screamed, though she was starting to calm down a little. “Are you  completely bonkers? Wait--don’t answer that question! I already  know! Maybe I should just ask what the FUCK came over you instead!!”</p>
<p>“What can I say?” Yenae giggled,  stretching out cutely. She struck a seductive pose, resting on her  hands and knees, and crawled after Alala like a sensual predator,  waving her tail hypnotically. “You looked so <em>adorable</em> when  you were asleep that I couldn’t help myself! I’m glad my little  smooch woke you up, princess.”</p>
<p>“Y…you were <em>watching</em> me  while I was <em>sleeping?!</em>” she screamed. “What kind of sick,  twisted nut are you? No, wait, never mind! Don’t answer <em>that</em> question either! I don’t think I <em>want</em> to know! Just get the  hell out of my room and--whuh?” She tripped on a rock as she  stepped away, looked around her, and realized she was not in her own  bed, or in her room, or even the <em>Dauntless</em>. Alala let out a  bemused <em>meow</em>, sniffed the air, wiggled her ears and tail, and  stood up in a dumb-struck awe. “Hey, where the hell are we, anyway?  Did we land on some new world, and nobody told me about it?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that we’re not  in Kansas anymore, little kitten,” Yenae muttered jovially. Alala’s  emotions overpowered her--confusion, shock, anger, fear,  embarrassment, and even arousal--and she lashed out at Yenae very  harshly.</p>
<p>“No shit, you evil demon!! We  must’ve been thrown here or lost or…AAARRGH, I don’t even know  how we GOT here!! It’s so <em>frustrating</em>! But the worst thing  is that I’m stuck here with <em>you</em>! Hey, wait a second!! Did  you see anybody else around here?” Yenae smiled sadly and shook her  head.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s just you and  me, grumpy butt. I could be wrong, of course--”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“STOP CALLING ME BY THOSE IMMATURE  NAMES!!”</p>
<p>“I mean, I haven’t actually  looked around. I only just woke up myself…just in time to see your  sweet little sleepy face!” Alala wailed like a siren bereaved of  all she held dear, opened the waterworks, and collapsed on the  ground, slamming her forehead in the grass.</p>
<p>“This isn’t happening,” she  whined. “What did I do to deserve this? It’s bad enough being  lost in an unfamiliar world, with no friends or food or shelter, but  I also have to be stuck with this harpy!”</p>
<p>“I’m a Changeling, sugar  muffin,” Yenae chirped, “not a harpy! A High Saurian! See, here  are my sexy horns and my cute tail! Notice the lack of feathers?  Although I would look cool with some wings! But no dove wings--I  can’t stand those frilly white feathers! Something more like a  bat’s wings would suit me!”</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Alala groaned,  raising her head. She had a charming green smudge on her brow mixed  in with tears and dirt; Yenae laughed wonderfully and scooted over to  wipe it off. Alala swatted her hand away, did the honors herself, sat  up again, and pulled her legs close to her chest, too worn-out and  aggravated to put up another fight. Yenae gave her a loving stare and  sidled next to her, placing an arm of support over her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so depressed, my furry  little angel. I promise I’ll look after you and take care of you.  All things considered, we’re very fortunate! If we’re the only  people on this world, we can spend the rest of our lives quite  happily!”</p>
<p>“You’re not helping,” Alala  grunted, shrugging off Yenae’s arm. The energetic blonde grinned  and rubbed her rose on Alala’s cheek.</p>
<p>“Sorry. I get carried away with my  fantasies a lot. Well, if we’re not alone, then our friends will  probably come looking for us. We need to make the best of things  until then, all right cutie-pie?” Alala just grunted and turned her  back on Yenae, not even bothering to respond or fight. The infamous  Holy Annoyance couldn’t bear to see her beautiful champion looking  so downtrodden--she much preferred to see her up and running,  bursting with energy and fire, ready to kick ass and conquer worlds.  That was the Alala she had fallen so deeply in love with, and if she  ever wanted to see that zealous woman again, she would have to act  fast. Without warning, Yenae pounced on Alala and kissed her cheek  from behind.</p>
<p>“I SAID GET OFFA ME!!” Yenae was  flung aside with incredible strength; she coughed and bounced to her  feet as Alala finally stood up and started to move.</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit, bouncy butt!  Gotta keep that passion of yours going! Mmm, it’s sexy! So what say  you to some breakfast? We can’t live on desires alone, you know!”</p>
<p>“Hey, great idea!” Alala  shouted, her back still to her adversary. “Why don’t you go in  that direction and I’ll go in this one?! Take your time while  you’re at it, and don’t worry about </p>
<p>directions! Hurry up, or all the  good food will be taken! You’d better run!” Yenae laughed merrily  and skipped after Alala, grabbing her arm and holding on tight.</p>
<p>“Silly girl! We’re in this  together! Besides, I want to see how the mighty warrior-genius Alala  goes hunting! I’ll bet you’re as strong as a lioness and as  powerful as a tigress! I’ll be your loving partner!”</p>
<p>“Must you?” she groaned. Yenae  smiled sweetly, licked her fuzzy ear, and dodged the swinging arm she  knew was coming.</p>
<p>“Of course! Someone has to watch  that sweet kitty bum of yours, and I’d consider it a pleasure!”</p>
<p>“I bet you would,” she growled,  feeling agitated and helpless.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Far off into the distance, a lone  figure observed the two women, studying their movements and behavior  before slinking back into the shadows…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>For hours the two women walked,  shaking off their sleep and the shock of waking in a foreign land,  using the time trotting to pick out landmarks and memorizing their  surroundings, should they ever need the knowledge. Yenae quickly  noticed that Alala’s hostilities grew in proportion the closer she  got: staying a stone’s throw away kept the cat-girl peaceful and  mellow, but every step nearer increased her antagonism, and brushing  up against her or whispering sultry words sent a shiver of rage  through her skin and silvery fur. Yenae loved teasing Alala--it was  the only way she knew to show how much she cared--but even she knew  when to exercise restraint, and calmed her impishness as they took  their first rest. The only things to eat were lizards and crickets;  Yenae killed a few by throwing her knives, and offered her prize to  Alala, who took the lizards raw.</p>
<p>“What I wouldn’t give for a nice  grilled cheese sandwich,” she said. “Hey, how do those crickets  taste? I can’t believe you’re really eating them.”</p>
<p>“I love them!” Yenae sang.  “They’re especially good with honey--just like a certain  contortionist I know!”</p>
<p>“Stop it!” she growled, turning  her back. The air was quiet and cool for a minute or two as the women  caught their breath and relaxed their muscles. They both knew it was  better to stay in one spot if they ever got lost, but if all their  companions had the same mentality, nobody would ever be found, so  they decided to take action and go looking for everyone. Yenae  fancied herself a </p>
<p>decent hunter, and she knew Alala’s  animal instincts were kicking in. Of course, she would’ve preferred  it if nobody ever found them--that way, she could be with the woman  she loved forever--but she wasn’t so irresponsible as that, and  besides, she was starting to miss her other friends. Alala shuffled  and broke the gentle stillness as she turned around, held out her  paw, and gave Yenae an even look.</p>
<p>“Let me try one.” Watching her  darling cat-girl was a joy in itself; Yenae could stare at Alala for  hours and never grow bored. To her amusement, not a single sliver of  disgust found its way to her face as she chewed and swallowed. “Hmm,  not too bad. I’d still rather have that grilled cheese sandwich,  but these are pretty tasty, too. So just why the hell do you insist  on following me around, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re the only person  around for miles, and I’d like the company. I already said I was in  love with you, so there’s the whole ‘being with my honey-buns’  angle--plus, two are better than one. We’ll stand a much better  chance of surviving if we stay together. <em>Somebody</em> has to keep  me warm on those cold nights.” Alala bristled and snarled, which,  despite her belligerent intent, only made her look cuter.</p>
<p>“I hope you’re not planning on  taking advantage of the situation!”</p>
<p>“Whatever could you mean by that,  snuggle-bums?” she giggled.</p>
<p>“You know what I mean,” she  growled. Yenae inched slower and gently took Alala’s hand. There  was a time for playfulness, but now she wanted to have a serious  conversation, and hoped that Alala would get the message.</p>
<p>“All right, I won’t. I see it’ll  really make you uncomfortable. You know, Alala, I’d never do  anything to harm you or make you feel distressed. I love you and I  care about you. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>“If you like me so much, why do  you always pick on me and make fun of me?” she snapped. Yenae  looked aghast as she drew back, still clutching her beloved’s hand.</p>
<p>“Is that what you think I do?  Sweetheart, when have I <em>ever</em> made fun of you? You know that I  feel nothing but the highest respect and admiration for you, and not  just because other people think you’re a brainless sex-machine. I  know how smart you are, kitten, and I also know how brave and noble  and wonderful you are. You’re my champion, Alala. How could you  possibly think I make <em>fun</em> of you? I just like to tease you, is  all.”</p>
<p>“Well <em>I</em> don’t like it,”  she grumbled. Yenae smiled sweetly and ran her fingers through that  wild mane of silvery hair.</p>
<p>“Your mother does it to you all  the time, and yet you two act like best friends.”</p>
<p>“But she’s my <em>mother</em>.  It’s…how she shows her love. That’s how it’s always been. I  wish there was some other way, but--”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And that’s how I show you I  love <em>you</em>,” Yenae whispered warmly. She edged even closer,  rubbing Alala’s hand, gently easing the feisty woman to where she  could hopefully trust her. “Listen, my beauty, if you honestly want  me to stop, I will. I’ve acted that way all my life, and let me  tell you: I only tease people I love and care about. You’ll notice  I never give this much attention to anyone else! However, if you  really want me to stop… If you really hate me because of it…”  She found herself crying, which was unusual for her, and her tail  slithered up, since both hands were busy, and wiped the trickle away.</p>
<p>“I don’t really <em>hate</em> you,” Alala muttered stiffly. “I mean, I thought you were evil at  first, but I also thought you were making fun of me because of…well,  my race’s stereotypes. But…I did hear how you admired me  sometimes. I couldn’t really pin your feelings down, though, and  I’m still doubting them. I know you’re not a <em>bad</em> person; I  just can’t really trust everything you say. At least I’m positive  you don’t really <em>love</em> me. How could you?”</p>
<p>“You can’t be serious, darling!”  Yenae exclaimed, moving over to she could look at her darling in the  eye. “I know I act a little childish, but I’m a free spirit! I  can’t prance around keeping my feelings bottled up! I’m the type  of girl who enjoys life to the fullest, and I never lie about my  feelings. I <em>do</em> love you, Alala, whether you believe it or  not.” She leaned forward to kiss her forehead, but barely brushed  her lips against the girl’s skin before she was rejected. Alala  jerked aside and moved away, dark clouds forming over her.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard all that rot  before,” she stated bitterly. “People have told me they loved me,  but they always manage to fuck me over in the end. You’ll do the  same, I can guarantee it. People only exist for themselves; they’re  so fucking selfish and cruel, and they don’t give a damn about  anyone else. They’ll hurt each other just for fun, or whenever it  benefits them the most, and leave them sick and alone in the cold  rain. But I’m a fool too,” she whispered, so hoarse that Yenae  could barely hear her, “a fool for believing in them, when they  look me in the eye and fill me up with their garbage. You say you  love me now, but later on, you’ll dump me to the side and forget  about me. You may as well just admit that right now and leave me the  hell alone, because I’m not falling for it again.”</p>
<p>Alala was weeping, though Yenae  didn’t know--out of fear, anguish, confusion, frustration, anger,  regret… She was pouring her soul out to the unlikeliest person, but  it was a burden she had carried around long enough: somebody needed  to listen to her, and Yenae was the only one around. She understood a  little about Alala’s past before, after eavesdropping on her squall  with her mother back on Tigris, and vague hints crept out  occasionally during regular conversation, but now the dam had broken  and all the troubles it held back were pouring out. Part of the  reason Yenae admired Alala so much was because she knew the other  woman had been strengthened by her pain: she was fighting to overcome  it and be a better person. She wanted to console her beautiful  champion, but she feared pushing Alala too far; the slightest nudge  might send her careening over the path of no return. So she said  nothing and waited for the storm to calm.</p>
<p>“I need some water,” Alala  sighed at last. She gave Yenae a shockingly mature, forlorn  expression, like she had been beaten and was desperately picking up  the pieces. “It looks like we’ll have to stay together a little  while longer. If…if I faint from dehydration, Yenae, you won’t  leave me behind, will you?” It took her awhile to form a good  answer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I think I could carry you, Alala.  But let’s not think about that until things get desperate. Come on,  I think I smelled a stream not too far away--and where there’s  water, we can probably get fish as well. Would it be offensive to ask  if you liked fish?”</p>
<p>“Only if they don’t talk to me,”  she managed to say, smiling beautifully through tears. Alala sniffled  and resumed walking with Yenae; she shuddered and instinctively  grabbed her hand. In that brief moment before her inner hell had  broken loose, it became a source of unexpected stability for her, and  she entertained the faint possibility that maybe, just <em>maybe</em>,  one person in the universe really meant what they said, and would  stay by her side come darkness or dawn.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Alala’s condition improved once  they found the stream, and she even started smiling again. Yenae  wanted to crack a joke or “show her affections”, but she figured  she was on thin ice, and didn’t want to push Alala any further, so  instead, she decided to just “be”--nothing more than a companion,  nothing less than a friend. If Alala decided to open up and resume  her spirited ways, Yenae would be there to play with her and laugh;  if she wanted to remain sober, Yenae would be there to comfort her  and listen. She dove into the water and caught a few fish for her  friend, even splashing her a little to gauge their relationship.  Alala sputtered and cursed, as usual, but she also fought back, and  even started tearing up clumps of grass and dirt to throw. Yenae  wanted to drag her friend into the river and wrestle her, but she  assumed Alala wasn’t ready for that level of playfulness yet. She  wanted to ease her champion into it first; she wanted to earn Alala’s  trust and love.</p>
<p>“Aah, nice!” the cat-girl  exclaimed as she reclined on the grass, picking her teeth with her  short claws. “Nothing beats fresh fish caught straight from the  river! And the water was nice and cold, too! Now all I need is a warm  fire, a soft rug, and Rachmaninov in the background.”</p>
<p>“You like classical music from  Earth?” Yenae asked. Alala smiled cheerfully; apparently, that food  and drink did her disposition wonders.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this friend of mine  introduced it to me when I went to the academy on Mars. She was this  really big music freak--I guess you could call her a genius--and she  told me about all the greats. Oh, she was the most amazing violinist,  the kind of girl that could make you dance or cry at the drop of a  hat! And she was pretty, too! I was really in l…” Alala came to a  screeching, emotional halt as she realized who she was talking about,  and her face changed from one of excitement to sorrow. Her tail  drooped and her ears sagged, and she scratched meaningless lines in  the dirt. “But that was a long time ago. It was just a dream I had,  and dreams never last. I hope she’s still happy, but I wonder if  she even remembers me.”</p>
<p>“Nobody could ever forget you,”  Yenae attempted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“THEN WHY THE HELL DID SHE BREAK  MY HEART LIKE THAT!!” The puckish blonde fell back in a daze,  horrified that she had pushed her dear companion over the edge, and  slowly recovered, not wanting to set off any more bombs.</p>
<p>“Ah…I’m sorry, I shouldn’t  have…”</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault,” she  muttered sharply, tossing fish bones in the river. “She just came  to mind, that’s all. It happened a long time ago. Just another  person that dumped me to the curb and forgot about me.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to talk about it?”</p>
<p>“Not to a devil like you!” she  spat. But Alala felt as if she would carry this baggage of hers  around forever unless she let it out, and as difficult as Yenae was,  she was also the only ear available. “But maybe I should. Her name  was Elena Pariello, and we met in college. We…fell in love. I  wanted to give myself to her, and marry her, but she…you know, her  family didn’t approve, because they thought I was just some stupid,  penniless, horny little cat-girl that was nothing more than a fancy  of their daughter‘s. They thought Elena was going through a phase,  anyway, and told her it was just a college thing. We…ended up  drifting apart, and she got married and had kids just as expected.  She gave up her dreams so easily…but what did it ever give her in  return? I never saw or heard from her again.”</p>
<p>Yenae was shocked. “You knew Elena  Pariello? The famous violinist? Alala, she’s legendary!! She’s  one of the top human performers around! Haven’t you ever heard her  platinum release, <em>The Aspiring Scholar</em>? That’s one of the  most beautiful works of art in recent times! And you’re seriously  saying you two were in <em>love</em>?!”</p>
<p>“Is that what happened to her?”  she asked doubtfully. “I mean, I haven’t heard anything from her  since we broke up! Good lord, if a lecherous bitch like you knows  about her, she must’ve gotten famous quickly! Talk about hiding  under a rock, huh?”</p>
<p>“I’ll say! Sweetheart, I thought  you <em>knew</em>.”</p>
<p>“What can I say?” she grumbled.  “Even a girl like me gets out of the loop every once in awhile.  What’s the name of that piece of hers?”</p>
<p>“<em>The Aspiring Scholar</em>. It’s  an exquisite piece she dedicated to someone she knew in college.  Wait, no--do you really think it could be about YOU?” Alala blushed  as she thought about it, but shook her head in denial.</p>
<p>“What? No way! If what you’re  saying is true, she would’ve written it after she got married!  There’s no way she would’ve dedicated something that awesome  to…me…”</p>
<p><em>But what if it was true?</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>“Regardless, I can see your ex had  very superlative taste!” Yenae chirped. “It’s only natural she  dedicate the <em>Scholar</em> to you. It suits you perfectly!”</p>
<p>“No it doesn’t,” she grinned,  blushing timidly. Alala’s eyes met Yenae’s, and for a moment,  there was perfect peace and understanding between them. She even felt  that weary old hope of hers coming to life. Yenae gently leaned  closer, their eyes still bound, and placed her forehead against  Alala’s brow, staring so deep into her sharp, bright-green eyes  that she could see her reflection. Their noses touched, Alala’s  cheeks deepened into crimson, and her heart hammered mercilessly in  its chest. She remembered every moment when Yenae had bullied her,  pulled her tail, touched her ears, tickled her skin, called her  childish names, flirted with her, touched her, whispered a suggestive  comment, and all those other times when she was generally a pain in  the rear: all those moments came colliding down, and the exhilarating  shock of being so close to such an infuriating woman gave leave to  the passion Alala had been harboring and keeping all this time. It  took Yenae by surprise, especially when Alala emerged from her cocoon  of insecurity and took an aggressive lead, pushing her tongue through  her lips to conquer Marliir’s world.</p>
<p>But at last they broke apart, with  just the same speed and savagery, and they were breathless from their  journey, both amazed at what had transpired. For all the fuss she had  made, Yenae’s earlier kiss had also excited Alala, and now what was  once a spark became an eruption, uncontrollable and consuming. Alala  hated the way that devilish woman teased her, and yet a deep desire  had been borne from it: she drove her crazy and it felt so good, too.  Yenae was wild, savage, and mischievous, but she was also warm,  understanding, wise, patient, and deeply loving, everything her  previous two girlfriends had been, hopefully without the attachments.  Alala’s fear of being thrown away a third time threatened to  destroy what little chance she had for happiness (the crush she had  on Amy didn’t seem to count), but as she looked into Yenae’s  deep, playful, sweet yellowy eyes, her wish strengthened and her hope  grew a little more. She curled up, not sure where to go from here,  and was held by patient arms as time, space, and purpose lost all  meaning. The moment was beautiful, for the few minutes it lasted: she  picked up sounds of somebody approaching them, and broke out of her  peaceful embrace.</p>
<p>“Oops, my bad!” exclaimed their  visitor as she parted the long grasses. It was Amy Miracle, of all  people, as cheerful and clumsy as ever, bless her. “Have I  interrupted a special moment? Should I, uh, wander around for a few  more hours?”</p>
<p>“We weren’t doing anything!”  Alala snapped as she sat up. “This jerk just splashed me with water  and was warming me up! I swear, she’s so twisted sometimes!”</p>
<p>“Only sometimes?” Yenae giggled  as she ruffled Alala’s mane. Alala swatted her hand away, but there  was a noticeable difference in her antagonism, like she was slowly  warming up to Yenae’s unique “charm”. Amy smiled gladly and  joined them, hopping around on her left leg (her crutch was nowhere  in sight).</p>
<p>“Well, I hope it’s okay if I  join you. I’ve had a rough time lately, and I could really use some  rest! You said you had water, right? I hope there’s a lot--I could  probably drink up a lake!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Help yourself,” Yenae said,  gesturing to the stream. Amy sighed with delight and dunked her face  in the water, slurping like a horse. Her pigtails had come undone and  she looked older and more mature; her chestnut hair got soaked, and  she giggled helplessly as she tied it back and wrung it out.</p>
<p>“Boy, I’m a real mess! I’m  glad I found you two, though. Have you seen the others?”</p>
<p>“Afraid not,” Yenae sighed.  “What about you?” Amy shook her head and leaned back so her  clothes wouldn’t get soaked from her hair. “Well, it’s possible  they all made it here, but it’s just as likely that we’re the  only ones.”</p>
<p>“I see. I’m sure that if the  three of us look together, we’ll find more clues.” Yenae was  smiling on the outside, but sulking on the inside. Now that Miracle  was acting as their third wheel, she wouldn’t be able to put the  moves on her honey-buns--and just when they were starting to get  closer, too! Amy looked back to smile at Alala, but the cat-girl was  bristling and hissing, every hair on her body standing on end. She  glared bloody murder at Amy and pounced on her with incredible power,  wrapping her hands around the woman’s throat. Yenae’s heart  almost burst as she fought to pry the two apart from each other, but  Alala was relentless and fought like the great kings of her  ancestors.</p>
<p>“Stop that! Get off her now!  What’s come over you?! Alala, if you don’t let go right now, so  help me I’ll…”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand!” Alala  grunted, her eyes and teeth set sharply. Beneath her, Amy whimpered  helplessly, pleading with sweet, honest eyes for her friend to let  her go. “You don’t understand,” Alala said again, “this isn’t  the real Amy! She doesn’t smell the same!”</p>
<p>“I said to get off!!” Yenae  whispered an apology before she yanked on Alala’s tail as hard as  she could. Her beloved roared in pain, and out of defensive instinct,  slashed Yenae with her claws, cutting four scars on her upper chest.  This also freed Amy, who staggered away coughing and gasping. Yenae  clutched her wound gravely, hurt both physically and emotionally,  while the Felinis glowered, swallowing great deep breaths as she  glanced between the two. She closed her eyes and tried gaining her  composure, but her muscles were tense, and she still looked mad.</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to hurt you,  Yenae. I’m sorry. I…know why you did that, and I know you were  only doing what you thought was right, so I forgive you. I…hope you  can forgive me as well. It was just…a reflexive action, that’s  all. But I swear on my mother’s grave that <em>this is not the real  Amy!</em>”</p>
<p>“What are you TALKING about?!”  Amy screamed, looking ten times worse than both of them. “Of course  I’m the real Amy! Alala, why would you say such a thing? I’m Amy  Blithe--why would you think I was anybody else?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you mean Amy Miracle?”  Yenae murmured. Amy froze in her tracks and hesitated, staring  quizzically. Marliir suddenly realized what was going on, that Alala  had been right all along (bless that adorable pink nose of hers!),  and jumped away in fear, pulling out two of her </p>
<p>throwing-knives. The Amy imposter,  meanwhile, rolled her eyes in frustration and grumbled to herself.</p>
<p>“Idiot! You walked right into that  one! Of <em>course</em> that secretary and Dr. Miracle were the same  person! It’s the oldest ruse in the book!”</p>
<p>“Who are you <em>really?</em>”  Yenae demanded. The false Amy threw away her glasses, glared at them,  and started backing away.</p>
<p>“Me?” she sang eerily. “I can  be anybody I want. I can be Alala, or I can be Yenae. I can be Amy,  your mother, your best friend, or just another random pedestrian on  the street. I am anonymity itself.”</p>
<p>“Whoever you are, I don’t like  you!” Yenae threw her daggers with deadly accuracy, but the  pseudo-Amy was faster than she looked, and caught them both in the  air, twisting with a dancer’s grace. She threw them back, one at  each woman, and used the distraction to run into the river, where she  was swept away with the current and escaped. Alala, being the agile  escape artist she was, had moved out of the projectile’s way with  little difficulty, but Yenae was not so nimble, and had been cut on  the leg. She cursed her sloppiness and licked the blood from her  discarded dagger before concealing it, but was unable to stand  without hurting herself. Alala growled in annoyance and decided to  assist the hapless woman.</p>
<p>“Hold on, sit still! You’ll only  make it worse, you idiot! Here: I’ll dress it for you. And don’t  get the wrong idea about my clothes.” She tore off a strip from her  shirt and wound it around Yenae’s leg, and even tied it in a bow.  She took another piece of cloth from her shirt, thereby exposing a  bit of her midriff, and fastened it around the cuts on her chest.  Yenae’s bronze face turned rosy-pink as Alala cared for her, and  she behaved herself even when her darling was hovering over a  precarious spot.</p>
<p>“Did you learn that from Fuuka?”  she asked.</p>
<p>“Naw, I took basic medical  training in high school. I figured I’d need it somewhere down the  road. Can you walk?” Yenae tested her leg, but it stung too much to  put any weight on. Alala sighed deeply, and resigned herself to  acting as support as she hoisted the woman’s tattooed arm over her  shoulders and lifted her up. Yenae beamed magnificently and quickly  snuck a kiss on Alala’s cheek before her hospitality expired.</p>
<p>“Thank you, snookums.”</p>
<p>“Bah, don’t mention  it--seriously! I mean it, now! If you say even <em>one word</em>, I  really will leave you behind! One word, Yenae--about anything at  all!”</p>
<p>“Can’t I at least thank my  beautiful champion one more time?” Alala stuffily turned red and  continued to hobble along, amazed that she was still stuck with Yenae  after everything they had been through…and that the other woman was  still enjoying herself.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You’re welcome,” she said  gruffly. Yenae purred and reached down to grope Alala’s rear end,  earning a vicious retort for her efforts. “What did I tell you  about taking advantage of the situation!!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, honey-buns, you know I  can’t help myself!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re pretty fucking  helpless, all right! And hopeless, too, might I add! I don’t even  know why I bother!”</p>
<p>“Because you WUV ME!” she  crooned.</p>
<p>“N-no I DON’T!! Y-you’re  reading too much into this! Mama would just disapprove if she heard I  left you behind, that’s all! You may live up to that very  well-deserved nickname of yours, Miss Holy Annoyance, but I’m not  gonna leave you to get picked clean by the buzzards, or whatever the  hell that <em>person</em> was we saw back there! That would be beneath  me!”</p>
<p>“I know, pudding pop! And I love  you so much for your honor!” She cooed playfully, but Yenae really  was grateful. Her tail quietly slithered over to meet Alala’s bushy  appendage, and as the two continued their search, constantly  bickering and teasing, their tails subtlety intertwined, embracing in  a quiet spiral that came to symbolize the bond they now had.</p>

<p>Alala: What E-VAH! I think the next  chapter will sober things up a bit. I hear there’s a messy love  triangle going on somewhere on this planet! I sure am glad I’m not  a part of it.</p>
