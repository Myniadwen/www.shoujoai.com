<h1>All Girls School (part 4 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Rough Edges&quot;

Ivory Tran--sexual goddess, martial artist, impish loner, bitch queen 
and pervert--sighed and whistled. She walked to school since she lived 
so close, plus it was good exercise. That same stupid song was stuck in 
her head, and the more she whistled it, the less she liked it. Her neck 
was getting as much an exercise as her legs as she walked, for she saw a 
pretty face nearly every step. She liked following her goodies closely, 
just to see their sexiful bottoms wiggle. Of course, being a stuck-up 
bitch-goddess, she turned her nose up to those she felt ugliest, 
chubbiest, or otherwise most unlikable--like snotty preps. Now they were 
intolerable.

Her last outing of lust had screwed her over good, then ran town to 
avoid her hateful wrath. Ivory was sometimes as strong as she was 
insatiable, and hated it when people dissed her off. She was prone to 
one-night stands, and so what if one of those other people left her? A 
night in the sack with a honey was a night in the sack, but being 
screwed over by said honey was more infuriating than a thorn in her 
skin. Hence her less-than-cheerful mood that morning, but Tran was 
infamous for her share of negative moods. This one was powerful, though, 
and justified. It would take one hot looker to keep her spirits high.

As it stood, there were plenty of luscious girls in Stanton High, and 
Ivory Tran was living every high school and college-age boy&#39;s dream: she 
was a lesbian in an all-girls school.

Her first class, Literature and Writing, started roughly. Miss Madsen 
was hot, no doubt, but more than a match for Ivory&#151;and sending her to 
work in a soup kitchen for homework made her utterly despise the 
gorgeous, strict woman. That Irish girl, what&#39;s-her-name, looked 
promising but way too energetic, and all the others seemed perfectly 
boy-happy, except for openly gay Mira van Dijk. Van Dijk&#151;what were the 
odds? Ivory would have to get acquainted with her later.

Foreign language was fun, but there was nobody really new inside that 
class. Alex &quot;X&quot; Walker seemed cool, albeit distant; Zane Klein seemed 
like Ivory&#39;s complete opposite, and she was definitely not into pale, 
ghoulish albinos (i.e. Lilian Nachtheim). Worse, though, was the 
presence of Usha Krishnan, a certified goody two-shoes. Ivory had no 
doubt that Krishnan was hot, but she was also a total dork who&#39;d 
probably end up marrying a sap. Too bad. Even Miss Torvald, foreign 
language teacher, wasn&#39;t her type, as gloomy as she did seem.

Math was more promising. The faces there were all new, but Ivory felt 
she didn&#39;t need to pay attention to them when a bonafide second goddess 
graced the room. Abi Cerio, a woman as sexy and exotic as her name, had 
came into the class like a sultry siren and kept everyone&#39;s attention 
locked on her. Frankly, Tran had to wonder how she got away with her 
flashy apparel, despite the casual school dress code. Ivory herself 
didn&#39;t exactly look like a lady from Victorian-era England, but Abi... 
wow!

&quot;I promise you, ladies,&quot; she had said early on in the hour, &quot;if any of 
you have a dislike for mathematics, I will do my best to rectify that. 
Don&#39;t you just love that word, rectify?&quot;

Ivory did.

Abi&#39;s lips moved like sweet oceans of honey when she spoke. She insisted 
on being called by her first name&#151;Abi. Maybe it was short for Abigail or 
Abbianne. Ivory didn&#39;t care, though: she had been fortunate enough to be 
placed in a room with a very sexy teacher who obviously&#151;hopefully&#151;had a 
thing for younger women. That thought alone made her pay close 
attention, and surprisingly, Abi wasn&#39;t just some doofus sex symbol who 
couldn&#39;t tie her own shoe; she was a genius at math and taught it well.

Most every other class went without event, save the last. By the end of 
the day, Ivory was weary of sitting and wished to stretch herself out. 
Since she was a physical girl anyway and liked getting hot and sweaty 
with other women, she picked the physical education class and opted for 
the kendo/karate club, which met after school. Finally! It was a genius 
combination of both her loves, plus a perfectly legitimate excuse to 
take a shower with a bunch of other sweaty, soapy, naked girls.

Life was good.

Class sizes were small in Stanton&#151;either that, or else people just 
decided to be absent their very first day. Of course, schedule changes, 
and&#151;hello! Ivory&#39;s train of thought (not &quot;Tran of thought&quot;, as she 
hated) derailed rudely and crashed into smithereens as a host of hotties 
crawled their way to the center of the gym. She had not seen any of them 
while she dressed for P.E. (sadly), so to her they came out of nowhere. 
Many of them looked at home in the gym, while some shivered and glanced 
around, antsy. Ivory&#39;s stomach did flips as she ogled their bare legs, 
arms, some navels, and upper chests. Wow!

Their teacher was more cute than sexy. She looked butch but acted very 
feminine, carrying an easy smile and a small sheet of their names. She 
was very athletic, with almond eyes and short blonde hair tied back in a 
tiny tail. When she spoke, her foreign accent showed through, though 
Ivory couldn&#39;t guess from where.

&quot;Good afternoon, ladies!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;My name is Leena 
Marjanna Katajisto. In this class, I&#39;m going to instruct your bodies as 
well as your minds, and it seems just from exam that many of you already 
have this physical intelligence. That is good! I&#39;m sure we will all have 
fun here, no?&quot;

&quot;Miss... Kata... justo, right?&quot; chirped a smaller girl. The teacher 
smiled effortlessly.

&quot;I know my name is hard to say, so I will permit you to address me 
informally. Please, call me Leena.&quot; Oh, Ivory loved that name. Too bad 
it was so hard to decide whether &quot;Leena&quot; was butch or femme. Maybe both.

&quot;Leena,&quot; continued the smallish woman, &quot;I think there&#39;s been a mistake. 
See, I have asthma, and I&#39;m not in very good shape. I really don&#39;t even 
go outside that much, and&#151;&quot;

&quot;May I interrupt, miss... what is your name?&quot;

&quot;Um, my name&#39;s Katt.&quot;

&quot;Katt, may I? Thank you. I don&#39;t believe there was a mistake in your 
schedule. I think somebody who feels they are doing poorest in phys ed 
should come to my class first, so that they may learn to use their 
body.&quot; Katt paused, and even though Leena had been both polite and warm, 
she tried to worm her way out.

&quot;But I have asthma,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;We all have handicaps,&quot; replied Leena sagely. &quot;I myself used to be 
frail. I will teach you at your own pace, Katt, so you don&#39;t feel 
overwhelmed.&quot;

&quot;Still&#151;&quot; Leena smiled warmly, walked over to the petite lady, and struck 
a cute pose.

&quot;If you&#39;re feeling out of place or weary, just tell me. I don&#39;t like 
giving special treatment, but I do make exceptions. I will try and bring 
out all that I can from you without exhausting you.&quot; Katt sighed wearily 
and looked as if she still didn&#39;t like it. Ivory frowned and crossed her 
arms, one thought on her mind: teacher&#39;s pet.

&quot;Now,&quot; snapped Leena, whirling around to face the rest of her class,&quot; I 
have arranged your group to stand in alphabetical order so I may take 
roll faster. Once I know who is here, we shall perform stretches and a 
light jog around the gym as a warm-up. Since this is our first week 
together,&quot; she said, pacing around coolly so that each girl could hear 
her, &quot;I&#39;m willing to take suggestions on what you&#39;d like to study here. 
After all, your condition will not improve if we keep going over what 
you hate, correct?&quot;

A few girls chuckled and smiled when she said that. Did they really have 
total control over the syllabus? Their own ideas would be accepted and 
used in class? This was a method of teaching that few of them knew 
about, yet all accepted gladly, especially asthmatic Katt. She could do 
a few stretches.

&quot;I have an idea,&quot; spoke one young woman. People turned and she spoke. 
&quot;Once school&#39;s over, I&#39;m going to open up my kendo-karate class again, 
like I did last year and before that. If anybody wants to join, I&#39;d like 
to see what you could do here.&quot;

&quot;Kendo?&quot; mimed Leena. The younger girl nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s swordplay with wooden swords, like fencing. It&#39;s what the samurai 
trained with.&quot; Leena shrugged, and since she had said she was open to 
suggestion, she accepted it. A few girls declined, though&#151;obviously 
those not joining up&#151;but Ivory wasn&#39;t one of them. She had been one of 
the closest to the girl, and from the moment she turned, she stared. 
Hard.

What a babe! What a bitchin&#39; babe!

Her name was Ancelin Yi, a French-Korean beauty who was taller and 
apparently stronger than Ivory. Her eyes were hauntingly cold, as was 
her expressionless face and voice, but the crowning achievement on said 
babe was her mantle of chestnut-shaded hair, rich and thick as flowing 
chocolate. The mane was unbound and free, stretching down mercilessly to 
her waist, and would&#39;ve made Cleopatra herself sick with envy and 
malice. Ancelin, it seemed, was humble about her beauteous gift, along 
with everything else.

Somehow, Leena managed to find a few short poles and sticks that would 
suffice as kendo staffs until Ancelin&#39;s class opened, and all the girls 
that seemed interested in trying out grabbed one. Leena noticed a fair 
majority opted out, and with an impatient stare in her maple eyes, she 
invisibly ordered her students to each try out the sport&#151;after all, 
their turn to pick a subject would come soon. Ivory, no surprise, was 
the first to try it. She picked Ancelin as her sparring partner.

&quot;I&#39;m Ivory Tran,&quot; she said casually, bending down to pick up one of the 
shoddy sticks. She tested it, swatting at the air, and found it good 
albeit a bit too skinny. &quot;I have to warn you,&quot; she noted saucily, ego 
naked to the world, &quot;I&#39;m very good at this sport.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; replied Anceline emptily. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re taking an 
interest. Maybe I&#39;ll see you after school.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; laughed Tran seductively, &quot;you can count on it!&quot; Both girls stood 
in defensive position&#151;proving, no doubt, they did know their stuff&#151;and 
squared off like a couple of regular old samurai. One of the girls 
snickered.

&quot;Just like a Toshiro Mifune movie.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;You ever seen Seven Samurai?&quot;

&quot;No, but I&#39;ve heard of it.&quot; The girl paused.

&quot;Clint Eastwood and Gene Autry?&quot;

&quot;Ah. I see. But they have sticks.&quot; The other girl sighed and covered her 
face with her hand. Uncultured woman...

Meanwhile, Tran and Yi seemed to have gotten enough of staring at each 
other. Ivory came after the beauty and let the hammer down, and Ancelin 
blocked and countered quickly. Ivory swung her stick up, and kept up 
with the taller woman&#39;s pace fairly well. If she had been truly 
seasoned, schooled by a master and wise in the art, she would&#39;ve known 
that Ancelin was restraining her skill. The other girls, few of them 
anywhere near their classmates&#39; skill, watched in awe as the two women 
exchanged blows. Leena smiled, crossed her arms, and gazed down at Katt.

&quot;Does that look like something you could do?&quot;

&quot;Possibly,&quot; she muttered, frowning and shaking her head slowly as if she 
weren&#39;t sure. Leena smiled and placed a hand of encouragement on her 
student&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Well, just try it for awhile. If nobody will agree to be your partner, 
you may spar with me.&quot; Katt gave her tall teacher a smile, a more 
confident one, and went to pick up a staff. Girls then went off in pairs 
and clumsily began to fence, some more ridiculously than others. Leena 
released a small laugh as Katt came back, smile on hand, and offered her 
a staff. She shrugged and decided, Why not?

&quot;So what&#39;s your name?&quot; grunted Ivory as she slashed, unsuccessfully, at 
Ancelin&#39;s defense. The girl introduced herself curtly. &quot;Well, that&#39;s a 
cute name, but a mouthful. How bout&#39; I just call you Annie instead?&quot; 
Ancelin made a face, neither positive nor negative, and fought back.

&quot;Annie&#39;s all right. I don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;Annie it is, then!&quot; exclaimed Tran, grinning through her blows. She 
brought herself closer to &quot;Annie&quot;, locking their sticks together, and 
hissed through clenched teeth: &quot;You&#39;re really good, and really pretty! 
Just my type, eh?&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but I could always be better.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too humble!&quot; she shouted, forcing Yi away. She took a breath and 
swatted at the air. &quot;You should give yourself more credit! Here you are, 
a vision of beauty and strength. Accept it and love it, just don&#39;t 
flaunt it.&quot;

&quot;I would never,&quot; replied Ancelin coldly. She raised her weapon in ready 
position, calling Ivory back for another. They had ended in a tie, but 
now she looked serious. Ivory smiled confidently, then expressed sheer 
audacious arrogance by swatting her opponent&#39;s staff with her own just a 
bit. Ancelin did little more than bat her eyes, apparently too focused 
and humble to care. Ivory lost her smile and brought her best on.

They both moved fluidly and violently, as if two separate oceans were 
trying to crash against each other. Some of the movie buffs, mainly the 
one making Kurosawa references earlier, couldn&#39;t help but see more 
examples of pop culture in their fighting. Had their masters taught them 
using a style familiar in the movies?

&quot;Cool,&quot; whispered one of the girls, too engrossed with the sparring 
match to contest her own partner. &quot;They look just like Uma Thurman and 
Daryl Hannah, or maybe Lucy Liu.&quot;

&quot;Kill Bill, right?&quot; said Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon. The girl nodded, and 
Gabrielle grinned. &quot;One of me favorite movies. Full o&#39; hot, sexy women.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; The other blushed and looked Gabrielle&#39;s way. &quot;I kinda have a 
thing for Daryl Hannah anyway. I saw Blade Runner and was hooked.&quot;

&quot;Oh? I&#39;m more of a Lucy Liu person myself, but whatever. Oh, um, I&#39;m 
Gabrielle.&quot;

&quot;Ayanna.&quot; The two girls shook hands and smiled&#151;then, Gabrielle realized 
something.

&quot;Oh, hey, wait! Are you Ayanna Montgomery?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re Olivia&#39;s cousin! I&#39;ve heard about you from her! So you&#39;re 
Ayanna!&quot; Ayanna smiled humbly and wiggled her eyebrows in what might&#39;ve 
been a shrug. Sure enough, her cousin was Olivia Johnson, though few 
people knew it or could tell.

&quot;Yep, I&#39;m her. She&#39;s never told me about you before. Are you a friend of 
hers?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yah! I&#39;ve known her since I was knee-high. Funny thing, her never 
mentionin&#39; me to you, but I guess y&#39;ain&#39;t close cousins or anythin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Not particularly&#151;oomph!&quot; Ayanna jerked around and flinched as she 
caught the tail end of a vicious attack. Gabrielle winced as well, 
remarking about how nasty the fight had gotten. Leena blew a whistle and 
dove in to separate them.

&quot;Okay, girls, okay! That is enough. You&#39;ve all proven you know how to 
fight, and I think a few of your friends are scared! You may please 
conclude this match after school, outside.&quot; Ancelin&#39;s face turned dark 
with shame, and she apologized quietly. Ivory, more open and cocksure, 
merely sent a rebellious gesture.

&quot;Eh, sorry bout&#39; that, Leenie. Guess Annie and I got carried away. It&#39;s 
our passion, I guess you could say, and I bet you&#39;d do the same if this 
were yours.&quot;

&quot;Still. Be careful. All right, girls!&quot; she then said, blowing her 
whistle. &quot;Does anybody else have any ideas?&quot; Ayanna and Gabrielle, 
positively dry of ideas, looked at each other.

&quot;Ya joinin&#39; her class?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really the physical type,&quot; shrugged Montomery. &quot;You?&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but not if nobody else does. Hey, ya wanna go out n&#39; get 
somethin&#39; nice after school?&quot;

&quot;Like on a date?&quot; Gabrielle shrugged and gave a cheerful smile.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t ask if I knew you wouldn&#39;t be interested!&quot; Ayanna smiled. 
She had her there.

&quot;Well, all right, a date. You seem energetic enough, though I do tend to 
go for blondes.&quot;

&quot;So date a redhead once in awhile!&quot; exclaimed the Irish, pulling on her 
prized locks of fire. Ayanna chuckled and promised she&#39;d give it a try.

&quot;Hey... Hero?&quot;

&quot;Yo, Haley! What be up with ye, grrl?&quot; Furious Hail crossed her arms, 
lowered her head, and gazed shyly in Ivory&#39;s direction.

&quot;What did that girl say her name was?&quot;

&quot;Which one, the brunette or the blonde with black highlights?&quot;

&quot;The blonde.&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh... Ivory, I think. Why?&quot; Furious Hail hugged herself tighter and 
sighed.

&quot;No reason.&quot; Hero nodded, leaving it at that, and went off to shower. It 
was a blessing that her gym class was at the end of the day, leaving her 
ample time to wash up.

Furious Hail sighed. Ivory. They had two classes together, and soon, a 
homework assignment. Life was good. For once.

Neither Ivory nor Ancelin, nor anyone who had wanted to sign up for 
Kendo, opted to shower after their last class, but only because they 
were saving it for after the meet (naturally assuming they would just 
get dirty again). Few people came, probably because it was only the 
first day, so it would be more intimate and personal. After seeing she 
would receive no more members, Ancelin greeted the girls with a curt nod 
and a few words.

&quot;I guess this&#39;ll be a small group this year,&quot; she began. &quot;Well, that&#39;s 
okay. Most everyone last year was a senior. I&#39;m Ancelin Yi, president 
and co-founder of Stanton High School&#39;s Kendo Club, and I welcome you. 
How many of you have experience?&quot; A few hands rose. Ivory grinned and 
winked at &quot;Annie&quot;.

&quot;That&#39;s good. I&#39;m pleased. Zane, would you please get the equipment?&quot;

&quot;Roger Wilco,&quot; said Zane Klein with a salute. She went back into the 
gym, briefly, to grab a large case that had the kendo staffs and some 
body armor. Zane gave each girl a staff and waited patiently for 
Ancelin&#39;s next instruction.

&quot;Please dress comfortably whenever we meet,&quot; she advised. &quot;No loose 
clothes, jewelry, or anything like that. We will be moving around very 
quickly. First, Zane: will you please?&quot; Zane stepped forward and began 
explaining, very simply, what kendo was, why it was taught, and why 
Ancelin and her absent cofounder decided to start a club. The speech put 
Ivory to sleep&#151;well, almost. She was too busy staring at &quot;Annie&quot;.

And to think, she cackled lustfully, in an hour or two, I&#39;m gonna see 
her naked!

The first meet had went without little to say of it, save that many 
girls made utter fools of themselves. Only Ivory, Aintzane, and Ancelin 
seemed competent; everyone else frankly sucked. Ancelin showed a quiet, 
hidden side of her by smiling very gently and assuring all the newbies 
that the first day was always bad and awkward, and to not give up if 
they were still interested. She was cold but very kind, a beauty wrapped 
up in humility, quiet and reserved and probably excellent when cuddled 
next to by a fire. Ivory was beyond smitten, and kept staring as she and 
every other girl filed into the shower.

Her foul mood earlier on died in the face of half a dozen beautiful nude 
bodies.

She undressed, raised a lusty eyebrow, and wandered into the shower 
coolly. Steam and rain fell, rose, and clouded girls when soap failed. 
Most of them engaged in small talk, others laughed, and some performed 
the usual act of checking out the other. Even if they didn&#39;t share 
Ivory&#39;s view of women, it was still nice to see the &quot;competition&quot;. Tran, 
however, was giddily impatient waiting for Ancelin. Surely she didn&#39;t 
shower alone!

She did not. Ivory&#39;s heart tumbled around her ribs wildly as the tall, 
dark, sexy Annie Yi walked into the showering room, naked and totally 
casual. Not only was she a sight to die for, the nonchalance of her 
appearance made Ivory respect her as more than a set of boobs. She was a 
cool woman. Ivory blushed and stared as Ancelin chose one of the 
showerheads behind her, flapped her hair up in relief, and stretched out 
to embrace the droplets.

Lucky water, thought Tran.

Ancelin did turn around briefly, probably assuming that somebody was 
staring. Ivory tried remaining cool, but what sensible lesbian could 
ever stay calm when faced with such a wonder? Screw Venus de Milo, she 
growled, this is the real goddess! She winked as her eye caught 
Ancelin&#39;s, and to her delight, Ancelin smiled back. It was faint, like 
the shade of a bosom barely visible past other wet bodies, but that was 
what made it even better. Ancelin then turned back around and showered, 
leaving only her back and backside to ogle. Ivory forced herself to look 
away and continued to wash the dirt away.

&quot;I guess I should be glad we&#39;re not alone,&quot; she whispered to herself. 
&quot;Otherwise, I wouldn&#39;t be able to control myself. Hmm... there&#39;s a 
thought.&quot;

She was dry in five minutes, and already ached for the vision of 
perfection.

She would have to go to a soup kitchen soon. Blech!

Ivory hoped she had gotten a good look, because she knew she wouldn&#39;t 
see anything hot, sexy, or even attractive down at that dump.

Furious Hail walked by herself to the soup kitchen she regularly 
volunteered at, hoping to see the beautiful Ivory Tran there. Hoping. 
That was a new feeling.</pre>
