<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>Kris and Kai walked down a long dark corridor, walls of grey brick 
towered overhead with no ceiling in sight, the only light provided by 
the occasional candle hanging upon the wall. Every so often they would 
pass by an opening in the wall without even so much as a glance. They 
had one destination in mind and they were speedily moving towards their 
goal when someone stepped out of the shadows to block their path. 

&quot;I can not let you do this, Aigneis!&quot; A tall woman in her early twenties 
commanded. Her long sleek black hair hung over the shoulders of a dark 
cloak. Her deep black eyes were filled with a mixture of anger and 
despair as she glanced between the two girls, &quot;Please Aigneis, Turn 
back.&quot; She pleaded.

Kris glared at the woman, &quot;Get out of my way, Julie!&quot; She ordered, 
baring her teeth, &quot;I have no time for this.&quot; 

&quot;Father, ordered you to never return.&quot; Julie reminded her sister, &quot;You 
choose that girl over family and you know the rules. You can never step 
within these halls again. If you proceed I will have to force you out 
and I do not wish to harm my little sister. Either of you.&quot;

&quot;Why should I listen to you?&quot; Kris snarled, &quot;Just because you are the 
oldest does not mean I have to listen to you. After all you said it 
yourself. I am no longer your sister so get out of my way.&quot; 

Julie&#39;s eyes shifted to Kai, who was hiding behind her sister, &quot;Keelia, 
do you really wish to help this traitor?&quot; She inquired softly. 

&quot;Julie please.&quot; Kai pleaded, &quot;You have to understand. Carey will kill 
Jennifer if we do not hurry.&quot; 

Julie lightly closed her eyes, &quot;I know.&quot;

Kris suddenly rushed at her sister and pushed her up against the wall, 
&quot;You knew?!?&quot; She growled, &quot;You were going to just let Carey kill Jenn 
and you were not going to do anything about it?&quot; 

&quot;She was supposed to die years ago if you recall.&quot; Julie remarked with 
so much calm that it got on Kris&#39;s nerves, &quot;We allowed Gwen to intervene 
before, however this time we will not allow any more outside 
interference.&quot; 

Kris punched her sister across the face sending her stumbling to the 
floor, &quot;How dare you!&quot; She towered over the woman with her fist 
clenched, &quot;You would intervene if it were anyone else wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; 

Julie wiped at the blood on the corner of her mouth, &quot;Of course. Carey&#39;s 
actions are not condoned by the rules of death.&quot; 

&quot;Then why not Jenn?&quot; Kris demanded, &quot;Why does her life not count?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; Julie&#39;s eyes dropped to the ground and she grew silent.

&quot;Because she is the one I love, am I right?&quot; Kris inquired with a sneer 
of disgust. 

Julie only nodded.

&quot;Why you bitch!!&quot; Kris flung herself at Julie, &quot;You are willing to let 
her die just because she loves me?&quot; She grabbed her sister by the collar 
and shook her, &quot;WHY???&quot; 

Kai grabbed Kris around the shoulders, &quot;Kris stop it!!!&quot; She cried, 
&quot;Don&#39;t fight!&quot; 

Gwen suddenly came running down the hall, &quot;Kris!!!&quot; She pulled Kris&#39;s 
hand free of Julie, &quot;Kris she is not worth it!&quot;

Kris let go of Julie and glared at Gwen, &quot;Why not?&quot; She demanded, &quot;She 
does not even care if Jenn lives or dies.&quot; 

&quot;But we do.&quot; Gwen stated, &quot;Not all of us are like her and you should 
save your strength for Carey.&quot; She quickly reached into the pocket of 
her cloak, &quot;Brother gave me this to help.&quot; She dangled a blue crystal on 
a chain before Kris&#39;s eyes. 

Kris reached out to take the crystal, &quot;A Malith Stone?&quot; The moment her 
fingers touched the stone she could feel it&#39;s energy wash over her. 

&quot;We need to hurry.&quot; Gwen coaxed, &quot;If you wish to help Jenn then you have 
to leave Julie.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Kris snatched the necklace from Gwen&#39;s hand and placed it around 
her neck, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She seethed as she got off Julie.

Gwen smiled, &quot;Good.&quot; She glanced down at Julie, &quot;Sorry Julie. I have to 
do what I feel is right.&quot; 

Julie simply nodded, &quot;Just go or I&#39;ll have to send Grania and Morrigan 
after you.&quot; She explained as she got to her feet, &quot;You have one hour.&quot; 

&quot;Julie?&quot; Kris stared at her sister in disbelief, &quot;But...?&quot; 

Julie smiled, &quot;I have to give a good front for father.&quot; She gingerly 
touched her cheek and winced, &quot;I think this will be enough to convince 
him that I did try to stop you.&quot; She stated weakly.

Kris felt ashamed of herself, &quot;I am sorry.&quot; 

&quot;Get going.&quot; Julie pointed down the hall; &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep father off 
of you for now.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Kris ran down the hall after Gwen with Kai right behind her. 
She clenched at the pendent feeling its power surge through her veins, 
&quot;Thank you too Milai.&quot; She closed her eyes and large glimmering wings 
spread out behind her filling the corridor. She took to the air; racing 
towards a swirling light at the end of the tunnel with her two sisters 
flying after her, &quot;Hold on Jenn, I&#39;m coming.&quot;
