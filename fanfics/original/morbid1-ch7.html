Maria stared at her dead reflection in her vanity mirror as she sat upon 
the matching plush bench before it. She was paler then she remembered 
being and her eyes had a glassy quality to them. She picked at a few 
flaks of mud from her damp dress, &quot;Mother, what happened to me?&quot; She 
inquired staring at her refection and turning her head to get a better 
look at the two blots that protruded from the side of her neck. She 
reached up and poked at one.

&quot;Now Maria...&quot; Clara said with a frustrated sigh. She dropped a new 
black gown upon the bed, a gown she personally bought for the girl only 
that morning, &quot;I thought I told you not to play with those.&quot; She crossed 
the room to stand behind the girl. She pulled locks of the girl&#39;s matted 
hair off her shoulders and stroked her damp head. It had only been hours 
since Ernest had retrieved the body of her beloved daughter for her and 
yet it felt more like years. She had given him a large sum of money and 
a note explaining that she wanted to bury her loved ones in the family 
mausoleum herself, so the mortician would have no concerns about the 
girl&#39;s whereabouts. She had been toying with reanimating the dead for a 
year now, however had only tested it on animals until now. Today she had 
a reason to test her theories on a living being. Some may have thought 
operating on her daughter would be maddening. However, for her, the pain 
of being alone would have been more then she could bear. Still 
everything worked out perfectly and her daughter was back in her arms.

&quot;But they feel funny.&quot; Maria complained as she once again turned her 
head to look at them in the mirror, &quot;And they look ugly. All the boys 
will tease me.&quot; Her mind turned to Jamie. What will her love think? Does 
Jamie even know she is alive?  She placed a hand upon her heart as her 
eyes filled with sadness

Sensing her daughter&#39;s pain Clara grabbed a black lace scarf from its 
place draped over the corner of the mirror. She swiftly wrapped it 
around the girl&#39;s neck, covering the bolts, and tied it loosely to the 
side letting the scarf fall over the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;There now, is 
that better?&quot; She asked brightly as she pulled the girl&#39;s hair out from 
under the scarf. She knelt down beside her daughter and look over the 
girl&#39;s shoulder at her reflection in the mirror, &quot;You look beautiful, my 
sweet child. Absolutely beautiful.&quot; Clara kissed the girl on the cheek 
then picked up a gold brush and started to remove some of the mud from 
her daughter&#39;s hair. The brush became immediately snagged on a large 
clump of what Clara at first assumed was more dirt. She leaned close to 
get a better inspection and picked at it with one of her long nails to 
find that it was in fact a massive blood clot on the back of the girl&#39;s 
head. She righted herself quickly and tapped the back of the brush upon 
her shoulder while thinking, &quot;I think I shall ask Anita to draw some 
water for you so you can have a bath.&quot; She set the brush down and 
started to leave the room then turned around to look at her daughter one 
last time. 

Maria looked up at her mother with her cold dead eyes, &quot;What is it 
mother?&quot; She touched the scarf around her neck, &quot;Is something the 
matter? Can you see them?&quot; She asked warily, nibbling her bottom lip.

Clara shook her head, &quot;No, no. I&#39;m just glad to have you home.&quot; She gave 
the girl a quick smile before she left the room and headed down the 
hall. Along her way she stumbled upon Anita, Maria&#39;s personal maid, one 
of the few maids that she had not dismissed. Anita was young girl, about 
the same again as Maria, that she entrusted to her daughter a few years 
back and knew that she could still trust. She asked the girl if she 
could help her daughter with her bath, noting to be careful of the clot 
and the stitches on her daughter&#39;s head. If the girl made any sign of 
being disturbed by the notion then Clara was oblivious to it. When the 
maid agreed, Clara continued her way to the main hall.

*******

Anita stood silently in the middle of the hall watching the head 
mistress disappear down one of the corridors. Anxiously she turned to 
look upon the door to Lady Maria&#39;s room. The rumour amongst the other 
servants was that Lady Greystoke brought the girl back from the dead and 
now Maria was a hideous monster to behold. This thought made the girl&#39;s 
heartache. She was feeling regret for telling the Lord of her Mistresses 
activities. She had seen Jamie and Maria the other night and was filled 
with jealousy for the boy. Lady Greystoke had given her to Maria when 
she was merely eight and the maid had grown rather fond of the young 
mistress. 

Thoughts rushed through the young maids head as she cautiously 
approached the door. She flushed at the memories of the first time she 
made love to her mistress. She had been nervous about the idea, however 
Lady Maria was beautiful and rather insistent. The young lady had noted 
on a few occasions about the way Anita would blush when helping her 
change or bathe, playfully teasing the maid from time to time. It was on 
one of those days, right after a bath, that Lady Maria first seduced the 
girl. Lady Maria told the maid that it was just a test, to see if she 
real loved women over men in every way. 

Anita gazed up at her mistress&#39; door and swallowed hard at the thought 
of Lady Maria&#39;s soft fingers running across her body. She had never felt 
anything so wonderful in her entire life. She licked her lips nervously 
and lightly knocked upon the door, &quot;It is Anita, Lady Maria,&quot; The maid&#39;s 
blush deepened at her own words, Lady Maria insisted from the time they 
first meet, before Anita was even assigned to her, that Anita refer to 
her by her first name only. Then a frown crossed her face. She truly 
thought she was Lady Maria&#39;s until that newspaper boy came along, 
however now he probably thought Lady Maria was dead and would not be 
around any longer. Her smile returned at that thought, &quot;I am here to 
draw your bath.&quot; She called out again and awaited Lady Maria&#39;s call. 

&quot;Come in.&quot; Maria&#39;s voice drifted from beyond the door causing the maids 
heart to flutter. 

Anita carefully opened the door and peered into the large shadowy living 
room, the only light was a soft glow caused by the fireplace. All the 
curtains were drawn tightly closed to not allow a single bit of daylight 
to enter, although the cloudy skies would not prove much light even if 
they were opened. It took a moment for the maid&#39;s eyes to adjust to the 
dimness as she searched the room for her mistress. Finally her eyes fell 
upon the silhouette of a person standing near the fireplace. The 
flickering light created a slight radiance around the person, &quot;Lady 
Maria?&quot; Anita probed as she stepped into the room a slight bit more to 
see that the person&#39;s back was to her.

&quot;Anita, my sweet, sweet, Anita.&quot; Maria voice drifted across the room. 
Anita felt herself smile as she heard the recognizable sound of her 
mistress&#39;s voice. The silhouette bowed its head and placed a hand upon 
the fireplace mantel, &quot;Anita, what am I to do with you.&quot; Maria shook her 
head slowly. 

Anita stepped back slightly, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean, My Lady?&quot; She 
was beginning to feel nervous. 

&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me!!&quot; Maria snapped, &quot;Father told me that one of the maids 
were spreading rumours about me and Jamie.&quot; She growled. 

&quot;I...&quot; Anita stammered and stumbled backwards until she bumped into the 
door causing it to close, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Maria spun around and set her dead eyes on the girl, &quot;You didn&#39;t 
mean for me to be killed?&quot; Maria asked, her anger mixed with a mild 
inquisitiveness, &quot;What did you think would happen if Father found out I 
was sleeping with a commoner? What? Do you think that he would simply 
forbid it and that would be the end of that? Did you think that we would 
live happily ever after?&quot; She asked bluntly causing Anita to cringe 
against the door. 

&quot;I...&quot; Anita tried to think, but her mind was muddled, she finally 
blurted out the first thing that came to mind, &quot;Lady Maria! I love you!&quot; 
She exclaimed. 

The anger in Maria&#39;s eyes washed away and was replaced by confusion, 
&quot;H... how... you can&#39;t love me... look at me.&quot; She turned up a lamp that 
stoop upon one of the end tables and was bathed in soft light. Anita&#39;s 
eyes darted over her mistresses. Maria still wore her damp dress; her 
hair was clinging around her pale face. There were spots of blood 
spatter upon her cheeks and deep dark stretches across her brow and arms 
and her eyes no longer held the bold green they used to, &quot;I&#39;m not even 
alive anymore. How could you possibly love me?&quot; She crumbled to the 
ground and curled her knees up close, &quot;I&#39;m a monster.&quot; She muttered. 

Anita cautiously crossed the room, taking in Maria&#39;s new looks. She 
tilted her head to the side and smiled, &quot;You are not all that, My Lady.&quot; 
She expressed with a new smile and knelt down beside the girl, &quot;You just 
need a warm bath and everything will be alright.&quot; She explained lightly, 
trying to not allow herself to show her unease over the rather gruesome 
scars upon her mistress&#39;s face.

Maria glanced into the young maid&#39;s eyes, &quot;You really don&#39;t think I&#39;m 
ugly?&quot; She asked warily, not sure if she really wanted to hear the 
answer. 

Anita brushed a strain of hair from the girl&#39;s face, &quot;We&#39;ll get the 
blood washed up and maybe cut your bangs so those stitches don&#39;t show as 
much and you will be good as new. I promise you, My Lady.&quot; She gave the 
girl a reassuring smile then began to stand, &quot;I&#39;ll go start your bath 
then, my lady.&quot; She turned to leave when Maria grabbed her by the hand. 
Anita looked down at her Mistress however Maria did not return her gaze. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Maria muttered, &quot;And I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Anita patted the girl&#39;s hand, &quot;I&#39;ll always love you, My Lady.&quot; She said 
in a whisper, &quot;Always.&quot;
