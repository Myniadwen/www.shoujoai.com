<p align="justify"><strong>Elila's   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I jumped over   the school gate quietly; scanning around the surroundings immediately   once my feet touches the school grounds. Still fighting to overcome   the sleepiness in me, I walk around to search any intruders in the school.   Since Mrs. Graham has given me a task to protect the school at all times   until I graduate from here in the future; I have to enter this school   before the sun rises, making me feel like an <strong><em>intruder</em></strong>.   It's an honour to do something good for this school, but right now...with   only 2 hours of sleep that I only managed to get (but gratefully peaceful),   I would really like to whine like a little girl right now. Yet still   trying to be alert, I went to go and check the school hall to see anything   that is out of the ordinary.</p>
<p align="justify">While walking,   I smiled a little as I recall what I had dreamed earlier. At last, after   12 months exact, I have finally been able to dream again. But this dream   is somehow strange yet content at the same time. I dreamed about Isabella   this time. Though it is not a surprise for me to dream about her, but   it was still strange. In this dream, I was walking through a garden   that seems to be from my home, and saw her on a swing. She was wearing   a white soft and long summer dress and I could hear the birds singing   delightfully. As I came closer towards her, she looks up at me and smiled   sweetly. I knew I was smiling in my dream and as I came nearer towards   her, there I saw a female child, curled up on Isabella's arms. I stopped   right in front of her, looking at the child questioningly yet my heart   seems to be singing with joy. The child was as fair as snow, with short   black hair. And when she opens her eyes to look at me, her eyes were   intense blue eyes that I have ever seen. She looks no older than a month   old. While looking at the little one, Isabella then got up from the   swing and went nearer to me and placed a soft kiss on my cheek. I was   stunned by her sudden intimacy towards me but I seem to be calm in this   dream. And there she said it. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Isn't   our daughter beautiful?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I remembered   waking up in an instant, with sweats on my forehead. As I keep looking   at each science labs on the 2nd floor, I can't help feeling   puzzled about the dream. What does the dream means? Do I feel afraid?   Hmm...No, I don't feel anything negative towards the dream. Having a   child with Isabella would surely be very new to me but I'll be supportive   about the idea of being a parent if I ever were mated to Isabella in   the future. But would that be my adopted daughter in the future? Would   she be the one for <strong><em>us</em></strong>? Then how could the child looks   exactly like little belle and I? Could I impregnate Isabella? I chuckled   at that last curious question. <strong><em>'That's ridiculous, I'm a female!'</em></strong> I thought logically. Shaking my head slightly, I try to not think about   the dream and went to check on the rest of the school grounds before   the students and teachers will be entering the school in another half   and hour more.</p>
<p align="justify">After fixing   a few minor problems of the securities in the school, I didn't realize   the people are starting to come in. I look up at the sky and the sun   has risen nearly to its fullest. It was a beautiful thing to see, as   I closed my eyes and open my arms slightly to welcome the breeze to   me. I could finally relax a little before the school bell rings in an   hour more. The sound in the school hall that was silent an hour ago   was filled with laughter, wooing, shouting and so forth. I walk past   them to actually observe them while on the way to my locker. I used   my telepathic skills to read some of their minds, just wanting to know   what are they thinking and hopefully nothing dangerous or against the   law. Some were decent and some were...well...not for children to know   about. And while channelling with my mind to theirs, I was greeted with   a lot of flirtatious smiles from cheerleaders and other common ladies.   I bowed my head to them just to acknowledge them, but not to lead them   on.&nbsp; And finally, as I reach to my locker, somebody suddenly pounces   on me on my back and I guarantee it is someone that I'm going to strangle <strong><em> very soon</em></strong>. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Lucas...,"</strong> I growled at the <strong><em>'attacker'</em></strong> behind me. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"YO   Cousin Lee! What's upppppp!"</strong> said Lucas, who seems to be screaming   near my ear. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"If   you don't get off of me this second, I'll strangle you without any hesitation!" </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Immediately,   he got off of my back and back away slowly. Then I hear soft-melodic   laughter&rsquo;s from a few ladies. I turned around and look at my cousins   in front of me now.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Geezz...be   cool Cousin Lee! Don't have to be all fangy on me! Where's the respect   between cousins and blood?"</strong> said Lucas, giving his best puppy   eyes to me.</p>
<p align="justify">I ignored him   and just greeted them all, <strong>"Morning cousins."</strong> I received   a few hellos and shy smiles from them. Before I was found out that I   was a protector, I was the only one that went to school here. But now   since I was <strong><em>'discovered'</em></strong>, a few parents from both sides   of my kin gave their approval for their children to enter here. There   were only six of us including me in this school and I'm grateful that   my cousins from both sides do get along with each other. Allow me do <strong><em> 'introduce'</em></strong> them to you. These five cousins of mine are the   closest to me in both kin. The one who <strong><em>'attacked'</em></strong> me was   Lucas, he's my father's nephew and also the youngest among the group   as he is fifteen-years-old. He has an extremely adorable yet wolfish   looks and everything about him is&hellip;well, very wolf like. He's a curious   young fellow with dark-greyish-eyes. But he can be annoying at most   times with his 1001 questions and naughty and also na&iuml;ve behaviour.&nbsp;   But I guess he brings the joy in our group whenever we feel tense and   serious. Then there's his older brother Leo, a handsome young man and   also 2 years older than Lucas is. He's a great hunter and a caring person   even though he always seems to be serious&hellip;like me. He has these exotic   greenish- eyes that he had inherited from his mother and good tan skin.   He seems to be a little taller than I am and such a gentleman. Lucas   always looks up to him and me because to him, we seem to be <strong><em>'older   and wiser'</em></strong>. I could always rely on Leo if I ever need him when   I'm down or so. And the other three more in the groups, are all my female   cousins. Tina and Tara are twins yet not identical and they are my mother's   nieces. Tina seems to be a little darker than Tara; and has a mix of   green-and-blue eyes, while Tara has light brown eyes. Tina has a slight   short black hair above the shoulders while Tara has a long wavy dark   copper hair. The similarities that they have between them are their   same height yet slim body, and have almost the same personalities. Maria   is more of a small petite lady. She has such a rich black long hair   and such fair skin. She has actually dark brown eyes, but sometimes   if you see it closer, you would mistake the colour of her eyes of dark   red. However and also unfortunately, she is my 2nd cousin   and also a younger sister to Melvin. Though I do not despise her because   of her brother, yet it makes me always wonder how she could ever be   related to him because of her gentleness and such grace in her. I did   notice her attractions towards me for a long time but I dared not to   discuss anything about it. Luckily her brother is not studying here   so I still could find peace in this school. It seems the way I described   my cousins, they sounded so beautiful or gorgeous, but actually they   are&hellip;I guess the beauty runs in the family or something. We are not   really in the category of the popular crowd, but I think people seem   to find us&hellip;.or probably my cousins, very intoxicating and probably   a fantasy to have in their minds. I'm not bragging over here but received   these facts from some of the people's minds. For other people, I don't   think I want to know what are they thinking of! Isabella however, is   hanging out with the popular crowd so her <strong><em>'so-called-friends'</em></strong> seems to think of me as an outsider&hellip;I think.</p>
<p align="justify">Speaking of   Isabella, I just remembered that I have to check on her before school   starts in probably&hellip;50 minute&rsquo;s time. Without a time to waste, I   asked some help from my cousins.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Hey,   I need a favour from you guys&hellip;and girls."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"OH   MY GOD!! DID I JUST HEAR THAT <em>THE</em> ELILA&hellip;and I mention again&hellip;<em>THE</em> ELILA&hellip;WANTING OUR HELP?!"</strong> said Lucas excitedly and too surprised.</p>
<p align="justify">I rolled my   eyes with his&hellip;childish and annoying behaviour. He really needs to   get it one day from me!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Yes,   I need a small help ok?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Sure,   name it,"</strong> said Leo calmly, waiting for me to give him some   instructions. Such a sweet guy.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Could   you all help me to search for Isabella please? I need to check if she   is alright or not." </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"YAY!   A task! I'm going!"</strong> said Lucas and immediately he left off,   leaving us all dumbfounded by his excitement. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Sure,   I'll take Tina and Tara with me, so if we see her, either of them could   reach you on time,"</strong> said Leo, being the first to recover and   bowed a little; and called the girls to follow him. The girls just obeyed   him and followed him along as Maria was left with me. I looked at her   and she looks down, extremely shy with my presence. I didn't know what   to say to her so I just pulled her left arm lightly to just follow me.   As we walk to search for Isabella, I could feel her leaning in closer   to me at my side. When I look sideways to see her face, I felt really   sad for her. Though she knows that Isabella is my true mate, she tries   a little to win my affections by just being there for me, being a good   friend to me and so forth. All of her doings would surely be appreciated&hellip;.   but unfortunately I can't seem to feel for anyone except little belle.   My father did tell me once that in his family, the men are very loyal   towards their mates. So if there were a seduction from a different woman   that is not their true mates, the men would not seem to feel anything   at all. If I was a ordinary person, I would give myself a chance to   explore a relationship with her, but with that thoughts, I felt myself   cheating on Isabella and also feeling a little bad for probably taking   Maria as a <strong><em>'second choice'</em></strong>. So the best thing I could   do is to be a good friend and cousin to her. So I just look at her and   smiled, putting my right arm around her shoulder playfully so she could   loosen up a little. It satisfies me to see her smile and relax under   my arm, as we walk along the school hall to continue our search.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Elila!   We found her!&rsquo;</em></strong> said Tina telepathically, gaining my attention   and alertness.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Good,   where is she? Where can I find you all?&rsquo; </em></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Near   the school fountain outside. Quick cousin, she doesn't look that good,&rsquo;</em></strong> said her sister, Tara mentally. I could feel her emotions clearly. Worried.   Wanting to help. So I quickly pulled Maria and we walk hurriedly outside   the school hall and walk towards the fountain. As we walk, I felt myself   feeling panicked all of a sudden. The need to see Isabella was like   a desperation that I could not avoid. I could feel Maria looking at   me and she looks down feeling guilty.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Elila?&rsquo;</em></strong> she said in my mind, feeling afraid.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Yes   Maria?&rsquo;</em></strong> I answered back mentally, also being patient with   her as we walk hurriedly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Whatever   my brother did to Isabella, I would like to say sorry on behalf for   him.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Hearing her   words in my mind, I slowed down and turn directly to her. She looks   afraid as she looks down. All this while when she found out her older   brother was dating with Isabella, she always seem to apologize for her   brother, thinking it was her fault somehow. I didn't like her to feel   that way.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Maria,   again I have to say, this is not your fault. Whatever Melvin did to   Isabella, he will have to pay one day. Maybe not now but probably in   the future."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Maria tried   to say something but I stopped her. I need her to know what I'm going   to say.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Enough   already cousin. I do not despise you nor hate you. I believe that God   will punish someone who do harm one day and if Melvin did something   wrong, he will have to pay for his sins. Not you, you won't pay for   his sins alright? I accept you as a friend and cousin and hopefully   you accept me as well whenever happen in the future between your brother   and I, can you accept me?" </strong> I said firmly yet softly to her. She looks at me and nodded slowly,   like a lost child that I just found somewhere. I then sighed in relief,   confident that she has understood as we continued to walk again.</p>
<p align="justify">We found our   cousins near the fountain. Lucas had joined them, as his face looks   slightly grumpy, probably didn't manage to find Isabella first. Silly   boy!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"We're   here,"</strong> I said to them, as they look at us and nodded their   heads. Well...most of them.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"About   time! Do you have any idea how long we waited for you?! ONE HOUR!&nbsp;   Are you a tortoise or a rabbit?!"</strong> said Lucas impatiently to   me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It   was 5 minutes Lucas,"</strong> I said, trying hard to not lose my patience   at him.</p>
<p align="justify">"<strong>Whatever!   It's still long!! Where's your....OW!!"</strong> Lucas yelped as he   turned around, finding that Leo had hit him on his head hard. Asking   him to keep quiet. I look at Leo and gave him a sign for gratitude as   he just nodded at me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"So,   where is she?"</strong> I said seriously.</p>
<p align="justify">They pointed   to the furthest benches on my right. I look eagerly to see her, but   find myself shocked by her pale face. She looks so pale and was wearing   long sleeve T-shirt, probably hiding something underneath. Her expression   held pain whenever she shifts her body. She just look down and not wanting   to talk to anyone at all. My human side seems to be crying and wanting   me to go and heal her, but the beast seems to have other ideas, like   wanting to awaken the rage in me to seek for revenge. I know my eyes   glowed a little and I suddenly growled, realizing that the beast wants   me to let it out. I struggled and found Lucas going behind the girls,   in fear of my state but Leo was holding my shoulders, asking me to take   deep breaths to control myself. Telling me that he also has a beast   in him. Saying that it's okay to feel the pain as he soothes me gently   with his words. My female cousins try to help to, entering my mind and   spreading the warm gentleness inside me, so the beast would calm down.   While Lucas, well he just stare at me as if I was a monster that just   got out from a cage. </p>
<p align="justify">It takes a   few minutes for my cousins to really calm me down. My forehead has a   few drops of sweats while trying the hardest to control myself, and   I felt guilty looking at my female cousins, who were a little, exhausted   for helping me mentally. As Leo thinks I'm ready to approach Isabella,   he gives me a little pat at my back. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Come   on cousin, time for you to go to her,"</strong> he said softly, giving   me some courage.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"ARE   YOU CRAZY?!! SHE'S GOING TO EAT THAT BABE!"</strong> cried Lucas dramatically. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"SHUT   UP!"</strong> said the girls, giving Lucas a shock.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Hey,   what happened to the graceful girls that I knew?" </strong> said Lucas, pouting his lips. Hearing his question, we all rolled our   eyes and it seems the girls are even losing their patience with his   improper attitude...well, improper to us I mean. And since my female   cousins are not answering his question, I might as well answer for them.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"They   could be as graceful as they can...but don't judge the book by its cover,"</strong> I said, giving him a sort of puzzle to solve. Then I turn towards Leo   to ask another help from him. As he looks at me with an understanding,   we both became serious as Leo waits for my command for the <strong><em>'mission'</em></strong> to come.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Cousin   Leo, I need an empty room to heal Isa, as I could see from her state   that she has been bruised badly. My idea is to take the girl's fitting   room and I need you to not let anyone enter that room that Isa and I   are in. For that, I need you to assist the girls to help too."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Hearing this,   Leo looks at the girls and they give him a nod, agreeing to help him   in this small task. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It   will be done,"</strong> said Leo formally and bowed a little to me as   a respect between hunters or protectors.</p>
<p align="justify">Smiling gratefully   at him, I turn around and take a few deep breaths, trying to reduce   the nervousness in me. Forcing my feet to move, I went straight to the   bench where Isabella was sitting with the air of confidence around me.   Or so I think it is. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Little   belle,"</strong> I said as I approach nearer to her. She looks up at   me in surprise and immediately I see her shifting nervously and also   painfully, and it was obvious that she's trying to hide something from   me. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Elila..."</strong> she said nervously but I didn't have the time to have a small chat or   hear her excuses, for time was running out and I only had about 20 minutes   to heal her. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Follow   me...no questions ask please,"</strong> I said firmly yet regretfully.   It's something that I really hate to do, to demand her obedience but   I guess at this situation, I had no choice but need her obedience badly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"W-what?   W-where?"</strong> I hear her stutter as she got up from the bench.   Feeling guilty for making her stutter yet at the same time, trying to   put on a brave face, I pulled her firmly yet gently to me and bring   her to the girls' fitting room. I could hear her asking her question   many times but I ignore her as we reach to fitting room. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Cousins,   is the room cleared?&rsquo;</em></strong> I asked my female cousins mentally.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;It   is already, better go in quickly before someone sees you,&rsquo;</em></strong> I heard Maria's voice from the distance in my mind.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Good,   do create some illusions so no one goes in the room,&rsquo; </em></strong> I command mentally and quickly open the door and pulled Isabella with   me in the room. To feel more secure, I went to check the shower room   and the locker room, making sure that there is no one in the room. Absolutely   confident that no one except Isabella and I in the room, I brought her   to the girls' locker section, gesture her to sit on the bench. Fearfully,   as if she has been caught red-handed, she stumbled her way to sit on   the bench and looks nervously at me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What   is it that you want?"</strong> she demanded, feeling scared at the same   time. I stand right before her and closed my eyes for a second, knowing   well that she would misunderstand me by my attitude.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Nothing.   I just want to heal you completely,"</strong> I said softly as I opened   my eyes to look at her dark brown eyes. Her eyes that held accusations   earlier were now replaced with confusion.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I...how   did you know that I was hurt?"</strong> she said, blinking a little.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"The   way you sounded on the phone earlier   this morning."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   she looks down feeling embarrassed of herself. Realizing that I knew   that Melvin had abused her violently in a way. With the thought of that   make my blood boils again but I try to stay calm for the sake of her.   As foolish as I sound, it is Isabella's choice to be whomever she wants   to be with. But on the other hand, I feel like hitting my head on a   rock for my stupidity. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Elila...Melvin   wasn't..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Stop!   I don't want to hear it,"</strong> I snapped a little, really not wanting   to hear about Melvin. <strong>"You are my friend little belle and no   matter what happens, I'll be there for you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She just stares   at me probably bewildered with my response. I didn't want it to affect   so I quickly make an effort to do the task that I'm suppose to do....which   is going to be <strong><em>VERY</em></strong> awkward for me!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Isabella,   I know you're hurt physically and probably some parts of your body are   quite badly bruised. I need you to...ermm...take off your clothes."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"WHAT?!" </strong> cried Isabella in shocked. I immediately realized what I said to her   just now and quickly back-pedalled.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   mean, take off your clothes that are only necessarily only! You know,   where your body parts that need to be healed...I can't heal you when   you're fully clothed....I won't take advantage of you I promise! Ermm...Protector's   honour?"</strong> I babbled weakly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   don't think I could trust a protector at the moment,"</strong> she said   sarcastically though not to me, as she calms down a little yet still   held nervousness on her expression. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Ermm...okay....   Hunter's honour?"</strong> I said calmly, trying to at least make her   trust me in this one. But she looks at me with her expression saying <strong><em> &lsquo;you&rsquo;re crazy&rsquo;</em></strong> look so I give another try of honour that   I could think of.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Wolf's   honour?"</strong> I said stupidly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Now   I know that you're crazy,"</strong> she said raising her eyebrow. Frustratingly,   I covered my face with my hands, trying to think of another honour....and   trying to really ignore the animal side in me that wants me to say, <strong><em> &lsquo;MATE'S HONOR!&rsquo;</em></strong> which my human side seems to want to strangle   the beast to keep quiet. Then with a sighed, I looked at Isabella and   said calmly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"How   about Friend's honour? I gave you my word that I won't take advantage   of you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I see her opening   her mouth, then closing it again...thinking whether she would allow   me to heal her completely. She knows I have never done any major healing   towards her, just bruises on her face and arms, only on the surface   that people could be able to see...but never her other body parts that   I never heal her before. Though I guess she knew that I could complete   the task with flying colours....but being a true mate and healing its   mate is a risk to not ignore. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Okay,"</strong> she said simply, as if she had thought about this seriously. She then   nervously got up from the bench and slowly takes off her loose T-shirt   over her head. I was quite taken back by her nervous yet bold move.   I haven't even turn around to let her change without me looking at her.   Honestly, I have never seen her undress before. Weird huh? We have a   girl's fitting room here in school but I always seem to try not to be   in the same room with her while she undress before...I don't know why...</p>
<p align="justify">As she takes   off her T-shirt entirely, I didn't quite see any bruises on her...ahem...stomach   or chest, but found dark painful bruises on her arms. I look at her   questioningly, not understanding why she has to take off her T-shirt   if her arms were only bruised. As she looks at me and understands my   confusion, she slowly turns around and immediately the colour of dark   purple and mixture of black-blue bruises seems to cover her back. I   gasped in horror, couldn't believe that Melvin could use his strength   on her. I try to calm down to fight the temptation of revenge in me   as continue looking seriously at her bruises. But even with the bruises   there, I find her body beautiful yet vulnerable, absolutely delicious   to touch and to taste at all times. I didn't realize that my tongue   touches my lower mouth, somehow hungry of the idea. <strong><em>'STOP IT YOU   BAFFOON! STOP THINKING LIKE THAT!' </em></strong> I cursed myself mentally as I cleared my throat and look at Isabella.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Is   that all?"</strong> I asked as I step closer towards her so I could   start performing my task but she seems to be quite nervous still about   something.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"There's...a   little bit more,"</strong> she said shyly yet afraid.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What   is it? Don't worry, I'll heal you completely,"</strong> I asked, being   concerned but at the same time trying to convince her to give me her   trust.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It's...it's...my..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Yes?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"My..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"....." </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"My   b-breasts..."</strong> she said in a whisper.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"......"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"E-Elila...?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Oh!"</strong> I squeaked a little. <strong><em>'OH GOD, HELP ME!'</em></strong> I thought to myself.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Outside   the girl's fitting room..... </u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"We're   getting tired Leo,"</strong> said Tina exhaustedly, as her other cousin   nodded in agreement. They have been trying their hardest to use their   minds to lock the fitting room's door so other girls won't get to go   in that room. Some girls were brutal the least, trying very hard to   open the door but failed.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"They   are still inside, we can't leave the door unguarded,"</strong> said   Leo, thinking of another way to prevent other girls going in to that   room. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"How   about we go in to the room and tell Cousin Lee that time is up? Then   we all could have some hamburgers in the cafeteria....OW!"</strong> yelped Lucas suddenly, realizing that one of the female telepaths have   hit him with her mind. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Very   good Tina, keep it up!"</strong> said Leo with a smile as Tina looks   down and blushed. Realizing that it was Tina's doing, Lucas tries to   argue with Tina but she gives him a hard glare, and cowardly he keeps   his mouth shut. As they sit down to think of another idea, and then   Maria got up suddenly, getting the attention from her group.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   have an idea,"</strong> she said quietly as she walks to another direction,   leaving her other members puzzled.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Back   in the girl's fitting room....</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Elila's   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>'I can   do this...I can do this...just don't think of anything erotic!' </em></strong> I thought to myself weakly, praying to God that I'll make it through   to this.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Ermm...okay....just...just   sit on my lap..."</strong> I said nervously as I quickly sat down on   a nearest bench and waited for her to come to me. I could feel butterflies   in my stomach and it seems to be driving me a little wild. But Isabella   still seems to have some issues about this awkward situation.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You...You   want me to take off my bra...now?"</strong> she asked in surprised.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"No!   I mean yes! I mean...Oh God!"</strong> I groaned as I slapped my forehead,   cursing myself for not being serious in this. I take a few deep breaths   and try to make the situation a little...less awkward.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Okay...ermm...here's   what we're going to do. Don't...open yet. You just sit on my lap and   I'll close my eyes as I heal you. No peeping honest! How about that?" </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"But...you   said you can't heal me if my bruises are...ermm...covered. And&hellip;.How   are you going to heal me with your eyes close?"</strong> she asked confusingly.</p>
<p align="justify">I think awhile   of what she said. She has a point there so I just simply shrugged and   try to make the situation at best.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"True...okay,   when you sit on my lap I will close my eyes. You can...take off your...bra   at that time. I'll be able to heal your back entirely with my eyes closed."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Then I looked   at her seriously.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"And   I'll give my hand so you could guide me whatever parts of your body   that need to be healed....alright?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She thought   for a moment and slowly walks towards me. My heart seems to be beating   like a marathon as she comes closer and slowly sits perfectly on my   lap. Instantly, her warmth seems to awaken the animal in me and wants   me eagerly to make a move on her. As her side leans near to my breasts,   my left hand seems to tighten the hold of the bench until I could feel   the sound of the wood breaking. My fangs wish to grow at that moment   but I try the hardest to control myself and not to whimper out loud.   As I hear Isabella unclasping her bra, I immediately shut my eyes tight   and dared not to look at her. Because if I do look at her...I don't   think I could trust myself at all in this situation. And slowly, I feel   her face on my shoulders, her arms slowly circling around me as her   nipples were now press against my breasts that was still fully clothed.   I knew at that moment that I have to heal her back first as I steadily   guided my right hand to her back, touching her skin gently but feels   like hot fire under my fingertips, hearing her moaning near my ear.   Trying my best to ignore such intimacy between us...I concentrated healing   her back slowly. Somehow, this seems to be not a great idea of mine&hellip;.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Outside   the girl's fitting room....</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Maria,   you're just brilliant!"</strong> said Leo proudly as he sees her work   from afar. The other females seem to agree along with Leo as they see   girls wanting to go in that room but suddenly walk to another direction.   At long last, they could just relax and wait for Elila and Isabella   to come out from the room.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Man!   Cousin Lee is taking so long! What is she doing? Mating? I mean...a   suitable place to mate for the first time...but not my forte....."</strong>Lucas   said grumbling. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Lucas...if   you don't keep your mouth shut...I swear I'll send you to the deepest   forest that only accomplished hunters could only survive,"</strong> Leo growled at his brother dangerously.</p>
<p align="justify">Scared by the   warning, Lucas obediently sits beside his brother and tries not to say   anything until his cousin comes out from that room. &nbsp;</p>
