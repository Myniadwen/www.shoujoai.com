<h1>Rival Rage: The Beginning of Aerolust (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Minato giggled childishly as she observed herself in her long vanity 
mirror. In her opinion, she looked perfect. She was wearing a long 
ashen Chinese style dress, (that Rinako had bought for Minato&#146;s 
birthday.) her favorite silver earrings and unlike most days, Minato 
had worn her long golden blonde hair up, rather than loose and free 
like it had been usually. 

There was no special occasion...well, maybe to others, but to Minato 
today was very important...

She was going to meet Natsumi.

Ever since they became friends, Natsumi and Minato had been seeing 
each other in secret. That was two whole weeks ago, but the time just 
seemed to whiz by for Minato. Hiding their friendship was tough enough 
as it was. The Cross Blade Lancers and the Spring Breeze Assassins had 
connections everywhere. No matter how careful Minato and Natsumi were, 
they always had to be twice as vigilant to stay ahead of the game. 
Especially from people like Izumi. Izumi Wakabashi was the eyes and 
ears of Tomeishuu High. Nothing could go on in secret without her 
knowing about it. Still, Minato had been able to keep her friendship 
with Natsumi a secret for a whole fortnight, so she was beginning to 
let her guard down a little. 

Besides she had other things to think about. Although Minato loved 
spending time with Natsumi, this little section of her wanted more. 
Natsumi had no idea how captivating she was in Minato&#146;s eyes. All the 
blonde had to do was just stare at Natsumi for a few seconds and her 
heart would be aching with desire. This was hard for Minato, love 
always was. Mainly because she didn&#146;t dare tell Natsumi her true 
feelings. Friendship was enough. For now. 

Minato grinned broadly at her reflection and blew a silent kiss to an 
image of &#145;perfection&#146;. 

After checking herself over, Minato slowly crept over to the door of 
her dorm room. It was around 10.00, and Rinako was having an early 
night due to her difficult training schedule, so Minato had to sneak 
out of here. She was still not ready to tell Rinako about the 
situation. Not right now. 

With a little careful footwork, Minato left the dorm room she shared 
with Rinako, and quietly made her way out of the dorm hall. This was 
going to be difficult. Curfew was at 11.00, but Minato knew full well 
that she and Natsumi wouldn&#146;t get back until about 1.00 in the 
morning. They just seemed to get along like a house on fire. Minato 
had offered for Shizuka to come along too, but neither Shizuka nor 
Natsumi liked the idea. Natsumi and Shizuka really didn&#146;t like each 
other all that much, Minato had no idea why, but she was willing to 
work on them a bit. 

In no time at all, Minato was out in the courtyard, and she quickly 
walked over to the front gates. As usual one of the staff members who 
watched the gates was there (the students call them guardians) to make 
sure nobody iffy got inside.

Minato passed by the guardian, but he quickly stopped her before she 
could pass through the gates. &#147;Hold it young lady. Where&#146;s your entry 
pass. You need it to get back in school.&#148;

Minato fished out her car, and flashed it at the guardian. &#147;Is this 
enough? Geez, you&#146;ve seen me pass through these gates a bajillion 
times already, what more do you need?&#148;

The guardian grinned. &#147;Sorry sweetie, but rules are rules. You need 
the pass to get back inside. Anyways, It&#146;s 10.05 right now, make sure 
your back by 11.00.&#148;

Minato waved off the guardian as she left through the gates. &#147;Yeah, 
yeah...I&#146;ll be back in time.&#148;

The blonde exited Tomeishuu with her chin held high. This was going to 
be a good night. She had promised to meet up with Natsumi just outside 
of the small park down the road, called Mizube Ai Park. And after a 
short walk, Minato&#146;s eyes laid upon Natsumi, waiting patiently for 
Minato&#146;s arrival.

{I hope Minato doesn&#146;t take too long.} Natsumi thought. {I&#146;ve been 
looking forward to this for a while...she really is just so-}

Natsumi&#146;s thoughts were cut short by Minato&#146;s eager greeting. &#147;Hey!&#148;

A small blush popped onto Natsumi&#146;s face as Minato ran towards her, 
with that same charming energetic streak. &#147;Minato...&#148;

**********

&#147;Really? You think so? Come on! I&#146;m telling you, my Math class is the 
most boring one of all classes! Especially since Principal Yagami 
started taking over the teaching...whoa, that guy is a bore.&#148;

Natsumi chuckled at Minato&#146;s crack at the Principal of Tomeishuu High, 
Daisuke Yagami. The two had left school about two hours ago, it had 
gone long past curfew for them, but neither seemed to care. They were 
both having way too much fun. The first thing they had done was to go 
see a movie. Cinemas in Shinjuku were always packed to the brim, but 
the two friends could tolerate it, as long it was a good movie. Which 
it wasn&#146;t...All action and no plot. Still, that didn&#146;t faze them, they 
just continued on and get a bite to eat at a ramen shop. As crude and 
simple as ramen may seem, it did hit the spot, at least in Minato&#146;s 
opinion. Shortly after that, the two girls stopped a coffee shop to 
relax for a bit.

Natsumi couldn&#146;t help but think the whole situation over. A movie, a 
restaurant, a coffee place? This whole evening had a striking 
resemblance to a date. Well, minus the make out. And Minato didn&#146;t 
really seem to notice it. Even so, Natsumi was having the time of her 
life.

&#147;Is Principal Yagami really that bad?&#148; Natsumi asked, her voice 
cracked by laughter. 

&#147;Yep! He is that bad. You&#146;re new, Natsumi so you haven&#146;t had the 
experiences that I&#146;ve had with Principle Yagami but the guy is a 
nightmare reborn. Far, far too strict for his own good.&#148;

Natsumi rested her chin on her hands and gazed upon the blonde 
intently. She really couldn&#146;t care less about what Minato was talking 
about, but as long as she was able to be with her like this...It was 
all she needed. 

&#147;I could listen to you forever, Minato.&#148; Natsumi breathed dreamily. 

Minato blushed, chuckled a little, and scratched the back of her head 
nervously. &#147;Am I that good of a storyteller?&#148;

&#147;Uh huh.&#148; Natsumi agreed. &#147;You tell great stories.&#148; 

That was nice. To be complimented by Natsumi. It meant something. 
Something special. &#147;Thanks. It&#146;s getting late, you wanna get back?&#148;

Natsumi looked at her watch. It was getting a bit late, particularly 
because they had to get up early for classes. Minato had always been 
an early bird, so these late nights were kind of ruff on her.  

&#147;Yeah, lets get going.&#148; 

**********

Fifteen minutes later, Minato and Natsumi walked down the quiet road 
to Tomeishuu High. Since Tomeishuu was on the edge of Tokyo, the 
streets got rather calm at night. With a bright full moon above and a 
cool breeze blowing through the cherry blossom trees, it gave this 
setting a...romantic feel. 

And this wasn&#146;t lost on either of the girls. Natsumi looked over to 
Minato to see if she sensed the aura of their surroundings also, but 
she looked colder than anything else. 

&#147;Are you cold, Minato?&#148; Natsumi enquired sweetly. 

Rinako&#146;s younger sister nodded. &#147;A little.&#148;

Without a second thought, Natsumi pulled off her jacket, and slowly 
draped it around Minato&#146;s shoulders. 

&#147;Is that better?&#148;

Minato smiled briefly, clutching at the inside of Natsumi&#146;s jacket. 

&#147;Yes. Thank you, Natsumi.&#148;

The Shinto priestess blushed and looked towards the ground, whilst 
maintaining her steady pace. &#147;No...problem.&#148;

Before long, the girls started to walk past the stone walls of 
Tomeishuu High. If the girls tried to get in through the gates they&#146;d 
probably get caught, so they both had to use secret entrances used by 
the student body. Minato would use the one on the north side of the 
school; this was Cross Blade Lancer property. Natsumi would use the 
one on the south side, which belonged to the Spring Breeze Assassins. 

The two slowed to a stop when they realized that they were back at 
Tomeishuu by now. Natsumi and Minato could say nothing to each other 
for some reason. Something was...different between them. Neither 
wanted to let this moment go. Not now. They knew that by going back 
into this school, they would be cast apart as enemies. It was like 
some sort of sick, cosmic joke.

Was this how it was going be from now on? Being separated from each 
other just because their friends and family wish it to be so?

The silence around the two girls was becoming awkward, so Minato 
decided to break the ice. &#147;I really enjoyed myself tonight.&#148;

Natsumi said nothing; she continued to stare at Minato, with the most 
preoccupied of expressions. That did not deter Minato however.

&#147;I know I&#146;d like to go out again.&#148; Minato said. &#147;If...you wanna come 
with me...then...y&#146;know...&#148;

Finally Natsumi broke out of her silence, and grabbed Minato by the 
arms, shocking the younger girl. &#147;Listen to me, Minato. Why do we have 
to do this? We&#146;re friends, aren&#146;t we?&#148;

Minato nodded, not willing to break Natsumi&#146;s soft touch. &#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;So then why do we have to listen to what Ayane and Rinako tell us? 
Why should we have to go in there and pretend that we are adversaries 
even if we aren&#146;t?&#148;

Minato looked away, sadly. &#147;I like you a lot, Natsumi. I really do. 
But...Rinako is my sister. I love her. I just...I don&#146;t want her to 
think that I&#146;m...betraying her. You don&#146;t know how much she hates 
Ayane. If she knew I was friends with Ayane&#146;s friend, she&#146;d be so 
angry...I can&#146;t go through that...&#148; 

Natsumi reluctantly released Minato&#146;s arms. &#147;So is this how it&#146;s going 
to be?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t want it to be, but...&#148; Rather than finishing her sentence, 
Minato moved closer to Natsumi. So close in fact that the platinum 
blonde could smell the sweet aroma of Natsumi&#146;s perfume. Steeling 
herself for just a brief second, Minato stood on her tiptoes and 
softly placed the sweetest of kisses on Natsumi&#146;s cheek. The eyes of 
the brunette priestess wide as tomorrow, shocked by Minato&#146;s display 
of affection.

Minato just smiled. &#147;Thank you for a wonderful evening.&#148;

Natsumi still couldn&#146;t believe it. {Does...does she feel the same way 
I do? Can she...can she be...?}

With a silent blush on her cheeks, Minato was about to turn away and 
head for the Cross Blade Lancers&#146; secret entry, however Natsumi held 
onto Minato&#146;s arm yet again. 

&#147;Wait...Minato...how do you...feel about me?&#148; Natsumi asked, her gaze 
now fully on Minato. 

Minato beamed an embarrassed smile at her friend. Maybe it was the 
atmosphere or what not, but Minato was afraid to admit this anymore. 
Not now. 

&#147;I like you, Natsumi...I like you a lot. More...than you can know...&#148; 

{I have to be dreaming.} Natsumi thought. &#147;...Minato...I...&#148;

The sapphire-eyed girl said nothing to Natsumi, only pushed herself on 
to her toes again and cradled her arms around Natsumi&#146;s neck. With a 
steely resolve, Minato firmly pressed her lips against those of 
Natsumi. And in an instant, Natsumi desperate search for love was 
over. Slowly, Natsumi&#146;s arms wrapped themselves around Minato&#146;s supple 
waist, and returned the kiss with equal passion. 

At last.

Minato finally had her special someone.
