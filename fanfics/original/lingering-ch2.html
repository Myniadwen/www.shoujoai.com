<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: The Lingering Shadows Within (part 2 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/lingering-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Inside we were faced with two decisions. There was a hallway directly in 
front of us and a stairway off to our right. I am not really sure what 
was down that hallway, but I was usually steered clear of that area by 
the other ladies. Something about it being used by a lot of the gay men 
that visited here. Our Place was open to all, but attracted primarily a 
lesbian crowd downstairs. So without a second thought we started on our 
way down the winding set of stair that were claustrophobic to say the 
least. The stairs were unpleasantly steep and circled around a couple 
time with only the bulb from the above hallway to light our path. I 
could feel the cold air seeping through the crumbling brick walls and 
wondered why no one ever cared to insulate these walls. It must be hell 
on the heating bills during these cold months, but I guess if they were 
to add in some insulation and drywall it would only add to the cramped 
feeling the stairwell already had. I glanced down at the stairs under my 
feet, being sure to keep an eye out for crumbling steps. The stair 
themselves were decaying from water damage and foot traffic. Someone 
years ago tried to cover them up with a red carpet that was now so worn 
down from the constant traffic it had turned black in the middle and the 
only sign that it was ever red was near the edges. 

&quot;Careful there, Beth.&quot; I warned as I pointing out a step that appeared 
to be ready to completely come free if it wasn&#39;t for the carpet keeping 
the cement in place. I hopped over the step and offered the woman my 
hand. 

Beth accepted my hand and stretched one of her slender legs over the 
broken step, &quot;Yeah, I hate that step too.&quot; She stated, grimacing at the 
stairs, &quot;You would think they would have put some money into this 
stairwell instead of spending it on more pool tables.&quot; 

&quot;I like pool table.&quot; I remarked with a light chuckle then wiped the 
smile off my face when I saw the serious look upon Beth&#39;s face, &quot;But 
yeah, they should really do something about this area. I wish they could 
open up the front door so we were not forced to come this way all the 
time.&quot; 

Beth sighed, &quot;As if that will ever happen in our lifetime.&quot; She stated 
miserably. 

I tried to think of a way to reassure her, but with the mayor of our 
town trying to shut down Pride week it was kind of hard to think of 
something positive to say, &quot;One can never tell what the future will 
hold.&quot; I remarked simply. 

&quot;I sure wish there was a way too.&quot; Beth returned flatly. 

Something pretty bad must have happed to the woman for her to be so 
negative. Beth was usually filled with so much life and laughter. It was 
unusual for her to be down about anything. It really worried me all the 
more, but I decided I would not push matters until a better time. 

We finally reached the last step to find ourselves standing at the end 
of a long thin hallway. A hallway that barely gave enough space for the 
both of us to walk side by side. The walls were freshly painted since 
the renovations, but for some odd reason I could still see the yellowing 
stains, peeling paint and cracks that lined the walls since the first 
day I visited this place. For me it was as if the past and present 
blended together in this hall and it gave me a dreadful feeling. The 
single bulb attached to the ceiling did not help relieve that feeling as 
it made our shadows stretch out around us as we moved under it. We saw 
another woman step out through an rainbow bead covered opening at the 
end of the hall and I could feel Beth hold close to me. It was almost as 
if she was afraid of the woman. As the woman passed by and I exchanged a 
greeting then we squeezed up against the wall to allow each other 
through. This place had a way to force people to be cozy or they would 
need to leave rather quickly. I wonder how many people never got passed 
the stairwell, never mind this ridiculous hall. 

We came across the women&#39;s washroom, which had no door, and I could hear 
the faint sounds of someone making out in one of the stalls. Sex in the 
washrooms never appealed to me and I wondered why so many resorted to 
such an activity. The stalls were barely clean and I could not stand 
using them even when I needed to take a pee. The thought of being pushed 
up against those grimy walls made me shutter, but at the same time it 
perked the curiosity of my darker side and I felt a need to force it 
away yet again. I glanced down at Beth and bit my lip. Sex was the one 
thing that this girl was not interested in at this time. She needed a 
friend right now and not a lover. I shoved the horniness out of my mind 
as we approached the bead covered door  and could hear the faint sounds 
of 80s soft rock drifting from within. 

&quot;Ladies first.&quot; I said politely as I parted the beads that draped over 
the entrance and allowed my friend to enter, &quot;May I take your jacket, my 
lady?&quot; I offered as I reached for her jacket. 

Beth giggled as she took off her jacket and held it out to me, &quot;Thank 
you so much.&quot; She said with a smile that I could tell was only half 
hearted. She wore a spaghetti string tank that complemented her features 
kindly and I found myself needing to look away before I stared too long. 

I quickly glanced around the room, taking in the scene and searching for 
a place to sit and talk. We stood at the back of the bar which was taken 
up by a set of four pool table, two of which were in use by a group of 
leather clad diesel dykes. Tucked beside the pool area was a space 
dedicated to several black leather couches and coffee tables set in 
circles. This was my favourite place to be when I&#39;m visiting. I enjoyed 
stretching out on a couch with a book in hand and a girl curled up with 
me. They even added in some smaller night tables with table lamps upon 
them that gave the place a very comforting feeling. It really did feel 
like home away from home. I could relax there forever if I was allowed 
too. I&#39;d even fell asleep here on a couple of occasions, to be awoken by 
a friend jumping on me. The wonders of friends, one could alway count of 
them to be there for you. 

The DJ&#39;s booth was located off to the right of the couches and the sound 
system focussed mainly around this area. In the middle was an empty 
space for dancing when the mood hits. At the far end of the room, which 
would have been the front if the main door had not been bolted shut and 
covered up with newspaper print, was the bar and dinning area. At that 
time I was a little hungry for I had missed dinner and decided that 
would be the best place for us to sit down for a chat. It was the 
quietest area of the club and a nice place to eat and catch up on old 
times. 

&quot;You hunger?&quot; I inquired of Beth as we carefully wove our way passed the 
pool players. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Beth replied with a shrug, which told me that she was 
hungry and just did not want to admit it. 

&quot;Well, I hope you don&#39;t mind me ordering some food because I&#39;m starved.&quot; 
I remarked while patting my stomach. 

&quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Beth stated simply. She seemed to be distracted by 
something and I glanced around to see what could have caught her eye, 
but saw nothing of importance. 
 
Everywhere there were many pretty faces, some I recognized and others I 
probably would know soon enough, that is if they stuck around long 
enough to be considered regulars. I noticed a few gay men here and 
there, but for the most part they were just friends of many of the 
ladies and not on the prowl. I smiled and waved to a few friendly faces 
on the couches, but for the life of me I could not see what could have 
been bothering my friend. I guess I will have to find out while we eat. 

&quot;Listen,&quot; I turned to her and looked her in the eye, making sure she 
returned my gaze, &quot;I&#39;m going to order some food. Will you be alright on 
your own for a moment?&quot; I inquired gently. 

She wrapped her hands around her bare elbows, &quot;I... I guess...&quot; Her eyes 
darted around the room as if she were in search of something that might 
attack her. Again I quickly searched for what she could be afraid of to 
see nothing. I wrapped my arms around her and hugged her tight. 

&quot;You are safe here.&quot; I softly reminded her, &quot;No one here will hurt you. 
I promise you that.&quot; I felt her arms squeeze me lightly and let go. 

&quot;You are so kind.&quot; She mumbled into my shoulder, &quot;I&#39;m glad you came here 
today.&quot; 

&quot;So am I.&quot; I admitted then lured her towards a dinning table. We stepped 
up three stairs to the bar and dining area, where I coxed Beth over to 
the first empty booth I could find, &quot;I will be right back.&quot; I assured 
the girl as I placed her jackets on the bench opposite her and took off 
my trench coat, placing it atop of Beth&#39;s. As I hurried over to the bar 
I found a place between two partons and slipped up to the bar.  

A bartender with long brown hair smiled at me as she handed to beer 
bottles to someone. I was not paying much attention to whom she handed 
the bottles to because my eyes were drawn to the fact that the 
bartender&#39;s short sleeved black silk shirt was unbuttoned. I could see 
her black lace bra clearly against the white skin of her breasts. Breast 
that were so perfect in my mind, the very size of my hand and the image 
of caressing them drifted into my mind when she suddenly turned to me, 
&quot;Hello Detective!&quot; Liz called out the moment I arrived at the long dark 
wooden counter that served at the club&#39;s bar. Liz like to tease me about 
my chosen perfection, but I didn&#39;t mind much, as long as it was only her 
that did the teasing, &quot;Ginger ale as always?&quot; She inquired knowingly, 
already placing a glass in front of me and prepared to fill it. 

&quot;Yep.&quot; I replied with a silly grin upon my face that I tried hard to 
wipe away, &quot;I&#39;m alright, I guess.&quot; I responded as I unbuttoned the top 
button of my cream dress shirt, loosened my tie and tried to fix my 
brown blazer. Fashion was not my forte and many had told me that I 
should consider something other then cream shirts and brown suits, but I 
happened to like these suits. It is hard to find clothes that fit me 
right. They are usually to short for my long legs or to loss in the 
waist. So I stuck with the business look. I mean I need to look 
professional in my line of work right?

&quot;I could be better.&quot; I stated nervously, to say that I felt strongly for 
Liz would be putting things delicately. She was absolutely beautiful. 
The way she smiled at me made my heart race, those large brown eyes and 
dimple were so adorable. She had curves to her that were beyond 
description and the way those tight jeans hugged her butt. I rubbed at 
my face as I tried to shake the feelings away. If she was not spoken for 
I would run around the counter at that moment and plant a kiss upon 
those soft pink lips at that very moment, but I have my morals and as 
such she was off limits. 

I lowered my hand from my face to could see Liz frowning at me as she 
filled my glass with a brownish yellow liquid, &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; 
She inquired in a tone of worry, god I sometimes wish I could just shout 
out my feelings for her. I pulled on my tie more and rubbed the back of 
my neck as I tried to sort my thoughts out. She glanced over my shoulder 
at Beth, &quot;Is Beth alright?&quot; She queried with concern in her eyes. Liz 
had been the bartender at this club even before it changed names. She 
was a kind and friendly women who was easy to befriend and considered 
the regulars to her counter as family. When she saw any of them 
distressed it effected her and she would do anything to help out. Right 
now I could see a mix of rage and worry in those eyes. She was probably 
thinking that someone hurt Beth and if it was someone at this club they 
were about to receive a piece of Liz&#39;s mind and that was not a pleasant 
sight to witness. I&#39;m just glad that I&#39;d never got on this girl&#39;s bad 
side as of yet. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I finally managed to push my feelings to the side and I 
took a look over my shoulder to see Beth huddled up against the wall 
with her knees wrapped up close to her. There was a frightened look upon 
her face as her eyes darted around the room like a frightened mouse in 
search of the house cat, &quot;It worries me. She is not the type to be 
dragged down so easily.&quot; 

&quot;If anyone can help her it is you.&quot; Liz stated with more confidence then 
I felt, patting my hand on the counter. The feeling of her hand upon 
mine sent shivers through me and I needed to pull away, &quot;If you need 
anything you know you can depend on me.&quot; She stated with a serious look 
upon her face. 

I picked up my drink and took a sip. I could see my hand was visibly 
shaking so I placed the drink back on the counter before Liz noticed, 
&quot;Thank.&quot; It was always nice to know you could depend on Liz for 
anything. She had comforted me through a couple of breakups over the 
years and at that moment I was hoping a breakup was all that was 
bothering our dear friend, Beth, &quot;Could you bring a bacon cheese burger 
to our table along with some fries.&quot; I placed a twenty on the counter in 
front of Liz.

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; She stated as she quickly snatched up the money and rung 
up my bill, &quot;Does Beth want anything?&quot; She inquired giving the girl 
another concerned glance. 

I simply shrugged, &quot;She says she doesn&#39;t, but I get the idea that she is 
lying.&quot; She stated in a low voice so only Liz could hear.

Liz nodded understandingly, &quot;I&#39;ll add in an extra plate of fries to your 
order, no charge.&quot; She offered with a smile that sent my heart a 
flutter. 

I glanced down at the counter, &quot;You are the best Liz.&quot; I leaned over the 
counter and placed a quick small peck upon the woman&#39;s cheek that caused 
her to giggle. 

&quot;Are you trying to get more then some fries out of me?&quot; She inquired 
with a mischievous grin as she handed me my changed. 

&quot;Maybe it would be... if you were not already taken.&quot; I remarked with a 
sly grin then grabbed my drink and stepped away from the bar. I could 
not believe I&#39;d actually said that. I must be insane or something.

Liz shook her head, &quot;You are going to get yourself into a lot of trouble 
one of these days, you know that don&#39;t you?&quot; She remarked, I was almost 
certain I could sense uneasy in those words, but ignored the feeling. It 
was probably just my imagination anyway.  

I took off my fedora and took a bow, &quot;I only aim to please.&quot; I stated 
with a flourish the spun around to face Beth. The moment my eyes set on 
Beth my smile Faded. 

For a brief instant I saw a flick of something unusual that wiped my 
thoughts of Liz away instantly. I&#39;d had strange flickering images appear 
before me for years and for the most part I had become accustom to them, 
however this one was different, It almost felt real. Instead of Beth 
being at a dinner bench I saw her sitting out on the street. A tattered 
blanket wrapped around her shoulders and her bare legs turning blue in 
the cold winds, a wind that I could feel wiping against my face and sent 
my tie whirling around. She looked so frail and lost, all alone with her 
back again the cold brick and a blanket of snow beginning to build up 
around her feet. When she gazed up at me her eyes were sunken into their 
sockets and had a vacant look to them. Like so many kids I&#39;d see on the 
street, but much worse. It was almost as if her soul was missing and 
only a shell was sitting before me. If I had not seen the change before 
my eyes I would have not recognized the girl at all. Then as quickly as 
the vision started it stopped and I was again standing in Our Place. 

Beth stared at me with a curious look upon her face, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; 
She asked quietly, then her eyes widened and she scrambled away from the 
wall, &quot;They are behind me, aren&#39;t they?&quot; She frantically tried to get 
out of the bench as if something were chasing her and if I had not moved 
swiftly she would have fallen off the end. It was a good thing I was 
fast and managed to get my arm under her shoulder&#39;s quickly because I 
got an awful image in my head of Beth cracking her skull open upon the 
floor. I&#39;d seen it a couple photos of such a thing and the one thing I 
did not need was to have a familiar face connected to those images. 

I cradled Beth in my arms as I sunk to the ground and held her close. 
She continued to try to break free of my grip, screaming as she tried to 
escape some kind of nightmare, but I held tight and did not give her any 
chance of flight, &quot;Beth! Beth, calm down!!&quot; I held the girl&#39;s arms close 
to her body and nuzzled into her shoulder, &quot;Please calm down, Beth. It 
is me, Brenda. Shhhhh...&quot; I cooed, trying to reach any reasoning left in 
the girl&#39;s mind. It seemed to work, I could feel her struggles began to 
weaken in my grip and she relaxed. I slowly loosened my hold on her arms 
and softly stroked at her head, &quot;It is alright. You are going to be 
alright.&quot; I lied, I hate lying, but at that moment I was not sure what 
to say. I had no idea what things were haunting this girl&#39;s mind and at 
that moment I just wanted to assure her that she was safe. It was all 
could do and I felt so hopeless not knowing what else to say. 

Several patrons started to gather around us and Liz came running out 
from behind the bar. I quickly glanced up at the woman and shook my 
head. Somehow Liz understand my silent command and slowed her pace to a 
crawl as she moved in closer, &quot;Is she alright?&quot; She inquired softly. 

I glanced down at Beth to see the girl had fallen into a light sleep and 
I let out a sigh of relief, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I stated in a lost voice, 
for the first time I did not know what was happening to my friend. Could 
she be on drugs or something? I turned her arms over to see no sign of 
needle marks, but that still left a large range of pills that she could 
have ingested. I looked up at Liz, &quot;Has Beth been taking any drugs or 
medication of any kind?&quot; I inquired worriedly. 

Liz shook her head in frustration, &quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of. I have not 
seen her around here in weeks. As far as I know she is clean. She never 
seemed the sort to turn to drugs.&quot; 

I took this in and mulled it over. Beth stirred ever so slightly in my 
arms as she slept, &quot;Could you help me get her to one of the couches?&quot; I 
inquired of Liz. 

Liz nodded and quickly moved to the girl&#39;s feet. Together we lifted the 
girl off the ground. She felt light as a feather, but she did not look 
thin at all so that made very little sense. She should have weighed 110 
to 120 at the very least, but at that moment she felt as if she was no 
more then that of a small cat. A group of people quickly vacated a 
circle of couches as we carried the girl down the small set of stairs. 

&quot;Thanks everyone.&quot; I whispered to the group, not wanting to wake the 
girl. I even noticed that the DJ, a big drag queen by the name of Madam 
Melissa, had lowered the music ever so slightly and came out of her 
booth with a blanket in hand. Like I said before, this is a very close 
group we have here. Once someone was having a really bad trip from 
mixing drugs and everyone rushed to help them while we awaited the 
ambulance. I think that is one of the few times that the front doors are 
ever opened around here. Sad to think that our doors have to be closed 
until someone gets hurt. Makes me want to cry at times. 

I sat down on the couch with Beth&#39;s head lightly resting upon my lap and 
Liz lay her leg across the couched then took the blanket gratefully and 
spread it out across the girl. We all watched in silence as we gave a 
silent prey to whatever god would listen to a us. I was not the type to 
believe in a god, but at times like this I really hoped that there was 
something out there looking over a few of us.
