<h1>Rival Rage: The Beginning of Aerolust (part 10 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Coming out of the shower, Mishizu fumbled to take a pure white towel 
off of the hook of her bathroom, softly drying off her dripping wet 
hair. She liked taking showers. Most women she knew preferred baths 
but Mishizu didn&#146;t. She liked to be on her feet to think about things. 

And she had a lot to think about.

It was currently Saturday morning, no classes or lectures to attend, 
no work that needed doing. Mishizu had taken the last of her exams on 
Thursday, the night Rinako and Ayane met up. 

Although Rinako had never said anything to indicate as such, Mishizu 
was fairly sure that something had been going on between them. Not 
while they were at Tomeishuu, those bed sentiments were fairly real 
(well, at least from Rinako). Something had happened before. Mishizu 
never dared ask Rinako about it, she would often get angry or upset if 
anything regarding Ayane was raised. Now it was all in the open.

And Ayane had Rinako back. 

Mishizu knew how pathetic it was to chase after someone who had no 
feelings for you, but this love for Rinako still did not waver.

Why?

{Why can&#146;t I put this behind me?} Mishizu thought. {Do I love her that 
much? Will I ever find someone else? And even if I do, can I give my 
heart to them in the same way?}

A knock came at the door.

Mishizu stopped drying her hair and walked out of the bathroom, into 
the dorm. Somebody was at the door. But right now, she really didn&#146;t 
feel like talking to anyone. Least of all...

&#147;Mishizu?&#148; It was Rinako. &#147;Look, can I come in? I know that you 
probably don&#146;t wanna speak to me, and I can understand that. But... I 
wanna apologize.&#148;

Mishizu fought an internal battle. After the way Rinako yelled at her, 
after all those things she said, could Mishizu just get over it? The 
aquamarine haired girl was having a hard enough time excepting 
Rinako&#146;s &#145;reborn&#146; relationship with Ayane. 

Mishizu thought hard about it. {I... I should let her in. She sounds 
so much happier than before. If I start ignoring her, she will not 
leave me alone.}

Without uttering a word, Mishizu walked over to the door and cracked 
into open by a tad. It was Rinako for, sure. As the door swung open 
the whole way, Rinako beamed an apologetic smile. That goofy yet 
charming expression of Rinako&#146;s did make Mishizu feel a little better. 

&#147;Can I come in, Mishi?&#148; Rinako asked quietly. 

Mishizu just nodded for a yes. Rinako strode in and took a seat on 
Mishizu&#146;s bed. It was purple, made from Egyptian cotton. The kind of 
luxury you&#146;d expect girl like Mishizu to have. 

The diamond-eyed CBL took a seat next to Rinako on the bed, and the 
two just sat there for a few seconds, gathering their thoughts. It 
wasn&#146;t an awkward silence, there never was between these two. But the 
did have some things that needed addressing. 

Rinako was the first to speak. &#147;...Listen, Mishi...&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;I am so sorry I yelled at you before.&#148; Rinako turned round slightly 
to face Mishizu. &#147;I was angry and messed up. Well, I wasn&#146;t in a good 
place. You were only trying to watch out for Minato and me, and I blew 
up the way I did.&#148;

Mishizu said nothing. 

&#147;Look, I understand if you&#146;re angry with me, and I don&#146;t deserve your 
forgiveness or anything. But you are my best friend, and I missed 
talking to you these past two days. And there really is so much to 
talk about. Can we please just go back to the way things were?&#148;

Mishizu looked over at Rinako. She was serious in what she was saying, 
Mishizu could tell. Rinako was genuinely sorry. 

&#147;I am not mad, Rinako.&#148; The Yakagi-girl said timorously. &#147;I&#146;ve had a 
lot of time to think about what happened and I know you just said that 
stuff from the heat of the moment. You hurt me though.&#148;

Rinako regretted that. Keiji too. But from now on, she wasn&#146;t going to 
act in a way that would hurt people. Not any more. She needed friends 
like Mishizu back on her side. Strong woman as she was, Rinako didn&#146;t 
feel like much without Mishizu&#146;s friendship. 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry I hurt you, Mishi.&#148; 

The young genius shook her head. &#147;I told you, I&#146;ve forgiven it. We 
will always be friends, no matter what stupid things you say.&#148;

Rinako smiled generously and pulled Mishizu into a hug. It would have 
seemed slightly odd to anyone else, Mishizu was only wearing a thin 
towel wrapped around her damp body, but Rinako was so casual about it. 
There was a layer of innocence within that blustery shell of Rinako&#146;s. 
But Mishizu just ignored her qualms and hugged Rinako back. 

It was heartbreaking to know that this was as close as she would get 
to Rinako on a physical level. Ayane was in her heart now. But Mishizu 
would let herself enjoy this. Being held by the one woman she felt 
most comfortable with. 

But the smile on Rinako&#146;s face fell. &#147;Mishizu... I have something to 
tell you. But I&#146;m afraid you&#146;ll react badly to what I have to say.&#148;

Mishizu pulled back. &#147;It is about Ayane, isn&#146;t it?&#148;

Rinako nodded. &#147;Uh huh. I dunno how to tell you this, but...&#148;

Diamond eyes rolled away from auburn ones. &#147;You and Ayane are in 
love.&#148;

Rinako could not have been more surprised. &#147;You knew? Who told you?&#148;

&#147;Ayane came to the dorms in the middle of Thursday night. She wanted 
to see you, and at first I was reluctant, but she said that she would 
try to make you happy again.&#148;

&#147;Was it that easy to figure out?&#148; Rinako asked. 

&#147;Yes. I could tell from day one that there was more to your dislike 
for Ayane than you made out. Which is one of the reasons I thought it 
was selfish of you to date Keiji the way you did.&#148;

&#147;Keiji...&#148; Rinako breathed. &#147;I have to apologize to him too... I think 
he really loves me.&#148;

Mishizu nodded, still not looking directly at Rinako. &#147;I think that it 
is best.&#148;

&#147;So...&#148; Rinako began. &#147;...What&#146;s your judgement on me and Ayane?&#148;

Mishizu&#146;s head jerked. That was the main reason she didn&#146;t want to 
talk about this. What could she say? That she resented Ayane because 
of her own feelings or just lie outright? It wasn&#146;t fair. 

&#147;Rinako.&#148; Mishizu decided to take the easy road. &#147;As long as you are 
happy with what you have then, I will not say or obstruct your 
relationship with Ayane.&#148; 

That was a relief. Rinako breathed a pleased sigh. Mishizu wasn&#146;t 
angry about her feelings for Ayane. But yet, Rinako failed to realize 
the truth behind Mishizu&#146;s actions. 

**********

&#147;No way! You and Rinako!? Hot damn, I had no idea the two of you were 
interested in each other! Geez, it all makes sense now. The anger 
between you two was way too fierce to be simple distaste! All this 
time it was a lover&#146;s spat...!&#148;

Ayane heaved a sigh as Natsumi continued her tirade of babble. It was 
important to the Spring Breeze Assassin leader that Natsumi and Minato 
knew the situation between she and Rinako. Rinako took care of telling 
Minato, now it was Ayane&#146;s turn to inform Natsumi. She was reluctant 
to tell anyone else about this though. Especially Izumi. Izumi was a 
loyal member of the SBA, and she did not have much of a liking for 
Rinako. Hopefully, Ayane would not have to choose between the two of 
them. 

&#147;So how long?&#148; Natsumi asked. &#147;I mean how long have you two been 
dating?&#148;

Ayane sighed once more. &#147;We used to date, we broke up, and now we are 
back together again. We just got back on Thursday. But I&#146;d appreciate 
it if you did not go telling everyone about it just yet. Especially 
not Izumi. I want the chance to tell her myself.&#148;

Natsumi stuck her tongue at Ayane. &#147;I know how to keep a secret, 
Ayane! I did the same thing with Minato remember? ...Hey! If Rinako is 
in love with you, how come she keeps getting in between me and 
Mina-chan?&#148;

&#147;I think...&#148; The gold-eyed girl began. &#147;That you need to speak to 
Rinako about that one. But she will not be standing in the way of your 
relationship with Minato anymore.&#148;

The moment she heard that, Natsumi&#146;s eyes glazed over. Nothing was in 
there way now. She and Minato could be together and they wouldn&#146;t have 
to hide it from anyone. 

Natsumi giggled happily. &#147;Ooooh... I&#146;m going to take Mina-chan out 
tonight! Somewhere really special, where we can get away from it all. 
I can&#146;t believe it. I thought for sure that she and I were going to 
have real problems thanks to Rinako, but... she&#146;s okay about it now?&#148;

&#147;Yes, Rinako will let you see her. But that doesn&#146;t mean she&#146;s any 
less protective of her sister though. You just make sure that you take 
care of that girl, Natsumi.&#148;

Natsumi scowled at such a notion. &#147;I would never upset Mina-chan. 
Don&#146;t be crazy, Ayane.&#148; Then Natsumi&#146;s thoughts drifted away from 
that. &#147;I should go see her, shouldn&#146;t I? It&#146;s only been a couple of 
days and I really miss her.&#148;

Ayane slapped a hand on her forehead. &#147;My word, Natsumi! Are you that 
fixated on the Ikatsuji girl?&#148;

&#147;Well of course I am!&#148; Natsumi yelled playfully. &#147;I mean come on, you 
gotta admit that Minato&#146;s cuter than Rinako, right?&#148;

With a strong blush on her pale cheeks, Ayane looked away. &#147;We are 
*not* having this conversation!&#148;

&#147;Ah, you see!&#148; Natsumi winked. &#147;My Mina-chan is the sexiest woman in 
Japan. I can&#146;t wait to see her...&#148;

Natsumi was about to say something else, until her phone rang. Each 
dorm in Tomeishuu had their own private phone line, however they would 
only receive calls. They couldn&#146;t call out. With a brief sigh, Natsumi 
strode over to the table and picked up the phone. 

Then her residual smile left her. &#147;...Father...&#148;

Ayane was curious about that look on Natsumi&#146;s face. The young miko 
just held her hand over the mouthpiece and looked over in Ayane&#146;s 
direction. 

&#147;Um...I might need some time for this. Could you...?&#148;

No other words needed to be said. Ayane stood up from the chair she 
was sitting on and walked off towards the door. &#147;I will see you later, 
Natsumi.&#148;

Natsumi nodded and faked a smile as Ayane left. She was alone. 

&#147;Dad?&#148; Natsumi said questioningly. &#147;Is everything okay back home? How 
are Tomomi and Yuri? Are they okay?&#148;

&#147;They are fine.&#148; Tetsuya Yakume said deeply. &#147;How have your efforts in 
tracking down the Seal Child proceeded?&#148;

Natsumi gulped. She&#146;d been spending more time with Minato than she had 
been spending on finding the Seal Child. It wasn&#146;t that she was 
neglecting her duties; Natsumi knew what she had to do. But the 
meeting with the blonde-haired bombshell that was Minato Ikatsuji 
threw everything out of whack.  

&#147;Well...&#148; Natsumi trailed. &#147;I haven&#146;t exactly been going to too much 
effort to find the Seal Child, but...&#148;

&#147;What?! Natsumi, don&#146;t you understand the situation?! I sent you to 
Tokyo to save us all not to enjoy yourself!&#148;

Natsumi shut an eye and pulled the receiver away from her ear as her 
father went on a wordy rampage. God that man knew just how to blow 
something out of proportion. 

&#147;Look father, just calm down a sec will you? I haven&#146;t been doing much 
of a search, but I do have a lead.&#148;

&#147;You do? Was it Ayane Yosukube? As we suspected?&#148;

Natsumi shook her head, remembering the Shunshibaru crystal&#146;s reaction 
to Rinako that day. &#147;No... I think it&#146;s someone else...&#148;

**********

Ayane meandered through the halls of Tomeishuu&#146;s west dorm area. She 
wondered what was being said between Natsumi and her father. He never 
called her much so it had to be something important. 

But those questions faded as Ayane&#146;s gold eyes caught sight of 
someone. Just a few metres from Ayane, standing proudly was a young 
woman, about a year younger than her. She was about Rinako&#146;s height, 
her head was swathed in long forest green hair, and her eyes were a 
faint shade of gingery brown. 

But what stole Ayane&#146;s curiosity was that smirk on the girl&#146;s face. 
Something about that girl did not seem trustworthy...

The woman walked up to Ayane with a leisurely pace, and her smile 
broadened as she inspected the SBA leader.

&#147;Hmmm...&#148; She mused. &#147;Are you Ayane Yosukube? The leader of the Spring 
Breeze Assassin gang?&#148;

Ayane&#146;s eyes narrowed out. She was sure that she had never seen this 
woman before. &#147;That is right. And who might you be?&#148;

The woman took a short bow. &#147;My name is Shizuku Makuryu. Or &#145;Shen&#146; to 
some others. Pleased to make your acquaintance.&#148;

Shizuku held out her hand for a shake. Ayane took caution, but shook 
hands with Shizuku all the same. Then Ayane&#146;s grip tightened when she 
felt Shizuku&#146;s aura. This woman was a fighter. And a half-decent one 
at that. Before she read too much, the SBA leader let go of this new 
woman&#146;s hand.

&#147;I am interested to meet the rest of your Spring Breeze Assassin 
followers... and to meet the leader of your rival gang... the Cross 
Blade Lancers. I hear she is a very capable fighter.&#148;

Ayane was alert. &#147;She is. Those who challenge her are likely to get 
themselves into some trouble.&#148;

Shizuku was not oblivious to the subtext of Ayane&#146;s comment. 
Everything she did screamed, &#145;stay out of our business&#146;. But Ayane 
still had no idea of whom she was dealing with. Shizuku wasn&#146;t one to 
be afraid of others...

&#147;I&#146;m glad to hear it. Well, I should be off. I am new to this school 
as you can imagine, and I need some time to adjust before classes 
start on Monday. But it was nice talking to you.&#148;

Ayane nodded in response, and Shizuku walked away, with that same 
devious smile on her face. Somehow, Ayane got the feeling that this 
woman was going to bring trouble.  

**********

&#147;Arrgh!!&#148;

With a brutal force, the young 15-year-old rebel of the Spring Breeze 
Assassins, Konoko, was smashed against the thick stonewall of a 
Shinjuku alleyway. With a small yelp, she slumped down onto the ground 
and coughed deeply. This was not the best of her ideas. 

A powerful and keen figure stood above her. 18 years of age, he was 
shirtless, wearing only a pair of expensive white jeans and strong 
brown shoes. He was also wearing a pair of black gloves, each one 
marked with a golden dragon. His hair was a spiky golden-brown, and 
his eyes were a fierce blood red. Though his body was muscular, it was 
also lithe, the mark of a serious fighter. 

With a deep frown, her cracked his knuckles. &#147;Geh. So this weakling is 
a sentinel for the Spring Breeze Assassins, eh? Pathetic!&#148;

With a vacuum-like kick, this great warriors&#146; foot rammed into 
Konoko&#146;s already abused stomach. She wheezed for air while the breath 
was knocked from her. She had challenged this man but she had no idea 
how strong he would be.

Yet what she failed to understand was that he was *still* toying with 
her. The combination of raw strength and an ancient fighting art made 
this man a very dangerous fighter. 

Another man of 17 years, sitting casually on a set of discarded 
crates, watched this with an amused smirk. Not from this Konoko&#146;s 
pain, but from his partner&#146;s flustered attitude. He had short dark 
black hair, a set of light blue eyes and a pair of mild glasses. 
Unlike the brown-haired fighter, this young man was wearing his school 
uniform. It was a Saturday, but he did enjoy wearing it.

&#147;That&#146;s enough, Zanga.&#148; The dark-haired boy said. &#147;To deliver our 
message, she should at least be able to breath.&#148;

With a lion-like growl, Zanga backed away. &#147;Heh. These Spring Breeze 
Assassins are useless. We will be able to sweep them away with little 
to no effort. Then we can focus our attentions on the *real* problem. 
The Cross Blade Lancers. Isn&#146;t that right, Ranji?&#148;

Ranji nodded. &#147;Correct.&#148; He then adjusted his glasses. &#147;Your brutality 
is needed, Zanga. But for now, we should use moderation to establish 
ourselves in Tokyo. They seem to hold firm to a set of codes here. As 
long as we follow them, we are untouchable.&#148;

The tall Zanga looked over to Ranji. &#147;Tomeishuu High is our next 
target? Hmm. It does make sense to pick them off by their own rules. 
This better work, Ranji. Your plan to enlist Shizuku in the school 
seems narrow-minded.&#148;

&#147;Patience, my friend.&#148; Said Ranji. &#147;In time, we will control all of 
this city. Tengoku-Aijin school is already ours. With Shizuku inside 
of Tomeishuu, we will have a pin-point view of the only two people who 
can stop us.&#148;

Zanga&#146;s blood red eyes glowed with intent. &#147;Ayane Yosukube and Rinako 
Ikatsuji...&#148;

&#147;Right!&#148; Ranji stood off of the crates he was sitting on, and walked 
over to a half-conscious Konoko. He squatted down and looked over her 
injuries. Black eye, bruised lip and a few cuts.  

{Nothing too serious.} He thought. {Still, Zanga could have taken it a 
little easier...}

Ranji sighed. Although Zanga was his leader, that penchant for 
violence over thought was a little bit worrying. Nevertheless, Ranji 
wiped some of the dust from Konoko&#146;s face gently and smiled.

&#147;Listen, young girl.&#148; He said charmingly. &#147;We won&#146;t hurt you anymore 
than we have. Just make sure you pass on this message to the one you 
know as Ayane Yosukube. Tell her that a new gang is in town; call us 
the Kyoto New Force Strikers. We have an interest in your group and we 
would like to hammer it out in person. In the form of a duel. Tell the 
Yosukube woman that we challenge her to a one on one match. Her 
against our leader, Zanga. It will be in one week&#146;s time, in the 
secret ground behind Mizube Ai Park. If she does not show herself, 
then we will bring ourselves over to Tomeishuu High and discover why 
she turned down our offer. Do you understand?&#148;

Konoko nodded weakly. &#147;I-I&#146;ll tell her...&#148;

Ranji&#146;s smile deepened. &#147;Good. And see to it that your wounds are 
tended to. You might have more promise as a fighter if you learn from 
you defeats.&#148;

Zanga coughed into his fist. &#147;Excuse me, but we do have other things 
to attend to? Save your post-fight pep-talk for another day, eh?&#148;

Ranji removed his hand from Konoko&#146;s cheek. &#147;Don&#146;t be so soulless. The 
heart of a woman is a fragile and beautiful thing. Just because we 
need to crush one woman does not mean we need to destroy them all. 
Your philosophy gets the better of you, my friend.&#148;

Zanga scowled. &#147;...I will never be able to understand that brain of 
yours.&#148; Zanga then turned to Konoko. &#147;Make sure Yosukube gets the 
message. I deeply look forward to meeting a practitioner of Rai shou 
en ken...&#148;
