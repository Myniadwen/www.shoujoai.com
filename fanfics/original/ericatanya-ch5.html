<a href="../original/ericatanya-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;You know,&quot; a smiling Tanya murmured as Erica helped her get out of the 
back seat of the limo then the two women paused for a moment in front of 
the cameras, &quot;you certainly know how to take a girl out in style.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Erica flashed her a smile as bright as the camera flashes. The 
black haired woman looked good in her form fitting black suit as she 
offered Tanya her arm.

Tanya gently took it, the gorgeous blonde in her white gown almost 
shining beside her dark companion. &quot;Wonder if we&#39;re making enough of a 
splash for Simon?&quot; she murmured as the two walked into the party 
together.

Erica chuckled softly as she wickedly answered, &quot;Well, I can think of a 
few other suggestions if we haven&#39;t managed it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; Tanya answered, but a smile tugged at her lips.

They walked into the building, noticing only the &#39;official&#39; reporters at 
the popular Hollywood restaurant. They had been invited to this party 
earlier, mostly due to Simon&#39;s publicity team, and after some talk they 
decided to use this as their debut as a couple.

&quot;It&#39;s so good to see you,&quot; Allison stepped up to greet them, the bosomy 
redhead oozing false sincerity, &quot;though I never expected to see you 
together!&quot;

Erica smiled back, her voice equally insincere as she said, &quot;Lovely to 
see you, too, Ali.&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you know that we&#39;re a couple?&quot; Tanya smiled, carefully hiding 
her own amusement at the whole situation.

Ali got oddly pale but she still kept that smile firmly on her face. 
&quot;Well,&quot; she took a half step backwards, &quot;I hope you have fun.&quot; With that 
she slipped away into the crowd.

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Tanya asked Erica softly.

&quot;More people coming,&quot; Erica nodded towards the approaching crowd as she 
added, &quot;I&#39;ll explain it later.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Tanya nodded in return. She beamed at the former child-star 
and said, &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you, Mr. Howard.&quot;

The initial meet and greet went on for a while, both of them acting just 
like a couple should as they shook hands and chatted about relatively 
inconsequential things with the broad mix of rising stars, b-movie 
actresses and has-beens that this kind of party usually drew out like 
bugs to a picnic. Finally they found a moment of relative piece, taking 
a seat at a corner table watching as the next group of newcomers were 
swooped down on.

&quot;Did you want something to drink?&quot; Erica asked as she waved down a 
server.

Tanya smiled slightly at Erica&#39;s almost instinctive gentlemanly 
behavior. &quot;Just ginger-ale, please,&quot; she said warmly.

&quot;Two ginger-ale&#39;s,&quot; Erica ordered the young man with a smile, the boy 
dropping off the two glasses only a few moments later.

&quot;So what was going on between you and Ali?&quot; Tanya asked curiously.

Erica took a sip of her ginger-ale. &quot;I ran into Ali at a certain private 
club a few years ago,&quot; she explained, &quot;one for lesbians only.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t she married?&quot; Tanya blinked, searching her memory.

&quot;He&#39;s gay, too,&quot; Erica sighed softly. &quot;Anyway, Ali and him are each 
other&#39;s protection,&quot; she quietly explained, &quot;both of them pursuing their 
own interests while still safely protected by their sham of a marriage.&quot;

&quot;And she doesn&#39;t want to be outed?&quot; Tanya asked.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Erica agreed, &quot;she&#39;s the closeted type who&#39;s afraid to be 
even seen near an out lesbian, for fear she might be outed.&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t sound pleasant,&quot; Tanya mused, sipping her own drink 
gracefully.

Erica watched her a moment, the way her throat worked as she swallowed, 
then she shook herself. &quot;Don&#39;t feel to sympathetic to her,&quot; she grimly 
cautioned, &quot;Ali all but destroyed a girl&#39;s career last year, gleefully 
using her to protect herself.&quot;

Tanya nodded, digesting that piece of information. She hesitated then 
asked a question she had been saving, &quot;What&#39;s it like, being an out 
lesbian in Hollywood?&quot;

&quot;Not so bad,&quot; Erica said, smiling at Tanya&#39;s disbelieving expression. 
&quot;Really,&quot; she said, &quot;it helps that I&#39;ve been out pretty much from the 
beginning.&quot;

&quot;How did that happen?&quot; Tanya asked.

Erica picked up her glass of ginger-ale, swirling it around before 
taking another sip. &quot;I first came here with my girlfriend,&quot; she finally 
said, &quot;it didn&#39;t work out, though.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Tanya murmured.

&quot;She had an affair,&quot; Erica admitted, &quot;because I was spending too much 
time out on the set.&quot; She made a face, &quot;And I found out she had gotten 
into drugs, too.&quot;

&quot;You broke it off,&quot; Tanya said, a feeling of absolute certainty filling 
her.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Erica asked, not really noticing how the two of them 
had bent close together over the little corner table.

Tanya smiled a bit sadly as she said, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t tolerate that sort 
of deception coming from someone you loved.&quot;

Erica nodded firmly, &quot;Got that right.&quot; They sat there in companionable 
silence, sliding back a bit but still intimately close. &quot;So any stories 
from the love battlefields?&quot; she joked.

&quot;Surprisingly few,&quot; Tanya conceded, &quot;I guess I&#39;ve been lucky that way.&quot;

&quot;Or unlucky,&quot; Erica offered, &quot;depending on how you look at it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Tanya murmured, &quot;or I may just be waiting for the right 
person to come along.&quot;

Erica raised an eyebrow, &quot;You said person, not man.&quot;

&quot;Imagine that,&quot; Tanya said, blushing.

In the background music had started up, people moving away from tables 
and groups of talking figures to gracefully dance. It was an odd sight, 
the beautiful people swaying together, careful not to muss clothes or 
disturb their carefully shaped hairstyles.

&quot;Why do I get the feeling Simon is going to be disappointed if we don&#39;t 
dance?&quot; Erica said softly, looking back at Tanya.

The blonde wasn&#39;t looking out at the dancers, instead Tanya was looking 
thoughtfully at Erica. &quot;Do you dance as well as you do everything else?&quot; 
she surprised Erica by asking.

Erica felt a slight blush touch her cheeks. &quot;I like to think that I&#39;m 
fairly good at it,&quot; she managed to get out, a bit unnerved by the warmth 
of Tanya&#39;s gaze.

Tanya smoothly got up from her seat, giving Erica a stunning smile. 
&quot;Let&#39;s find out, shall we?&quot; she asked gently.

Erica was right behind her, only stopping a moment to straighten her 
suit coat. &quot;Whatever the lady wishes,&quot; she took Tanya&#39;s hand, gently 
leading her to the dance floor.

There was a moment of shocked silence in the party as the two women 
swayed together. The people had heard all the rumors of course, seen the 
tabloids, but no one had really thought it was true. But the boyish 
woman cradled her ladylike partner closely, tenderly, and there was 
something in their eyes as they danced that spoke of a deeper caring.

&quot;Tell me, did you sail across the sun, Did you make it to the Milky Way 
to see the lights all faded, that heaven is overrated,&quot; the song played 
as they moved gracefully, &quot;Tell me, did you fall from a shooting star, 
one without a permanent scar, and then you missed me while you were 
looking for yourself out there...&quot;

&quot;Do you think we&#39;ve made Simon happy yet?&quot; Tanya softly whispered, her 
breath gently blowing by Erica&#39;s ear.

Erica let Tanya slip away, turned her gently, then pulled her back 
again. &quot;Maybe.&quot; she answered softly, &quot;but could we keep doing this for 
awhile?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Tanya quietly answered.

To be continued....

Author&#39;s Note: the song that they&#39;re dancing to is Drops of Jupiter by 
Train, the lines I quoted were all taken from the chorus.</pre>
