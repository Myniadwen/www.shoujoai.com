<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 13 of 19)</h1>

<a href="../original/artemis-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Athena smiled faintly, walking with some of her
students away from the busy theater. The athletic
blonde warrior looked visibly amused as she said, &quot;I
never knew there was a Japanese film festival this
week.&quot;

Yoriko grinned up at her teacher, her black hair
falling into her eyes as she cheerfully pointed out,
&quot;Come on, do you really think we&#39;d miss the chance to
see the original Seven Samurai? Or Lone Wolf and Cub?&quot;

&quot;Akira Kurosawa is a GOD,&quot; one of the other young men
commented, awe in his voice.

Athena fought back a grin as she listened, thinking
that she was glad that she had decided to take on
teaching this class. She occasionally wondered how
these children might react to knowing that she had
fought samurai once upon a time, but any temptation to
tell was fleeting.

&quot;What did you think of the fight scenes, Sensei?&quot; Alec
asked curiously.

&quot;Very well done,&quot; Athena answered that automatically,
&quot;though I suspect that real combat wasn&#39;t as graceful
as that.&quot; She smiled faintly, &quot;Swords are bloody
instruments no matter how sharp or well made...&quot;

&quot;How about Kill Bill?&quot; another student asked, the slim
redheaded girl smiling behind her almost round
glasses. Shannon Mcgee was a older student as well as
a mystic, one of Circe&#39;s allies, and she was a bit of
an odd duck.

&#39;Though I&#39;m not really one to talk,&#39; Athena noted.
&quot;It&#39;s a terrific homage,&quot; she answered the question,
&quot;but hard to consider otherwise.&quot; A pause, &quot;Though I
will admit that Lucy Lui is hot.&quot;

There was a chorus of agreement on that point, then
they began to disperse as they neared the community
center they all trained at, heading for various rides
home. &quot;Sensei, we occasionally have anime nights at
one of our houses,&quot; Yoriko took a moment to tell her,
&quot;would you like us to let you know about when the next
one is?&quot;

&quot;Why the invitation?&quot; Athena raised a eyebrow.

&quot;We would have invited you earlier,&quot; Alec said
honestly, &quot;but you&#39;re normally a pretty reserved
person, ma&#39;am.&quot; He flashed a smile, &quot;But after seeing
you cheer at the screen tonight, I figured your one of
us.&quot;

Athena laughed, &quot;True enough. Let me know, I&#39;d like to
join you all.&quot;

Waving to them in farewell Athena put her sword case
over her shoulder and was off, striding down the
street with determination. The air was still a bit
cool at night but the chill didn&#39;t bother her, her
pants and blouse enough protection against the
weather.

&quot;Hey, Athena,&quot; Erin waved cheerfully as she caught up.
The brown haired martial artist had met Athena shortly
after she started her kendo classes, the lanky young
lady quickly becoming a friend to the goddess.

&quot;Erin,&quot; Athena smiled, &quot;how&#39;s Susan?&quot; Erin actually
blushed cutely, pushing her glasses up. Athena had
heard through the grapevine that Erin was dating a
vampire, something the girl had quickly confirmed, but
her shyness on the issue was adorable.

&quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Erin smiled. She cleared her throat,
&quot;Uhm, I just wanted to tell you there&#39;s been a women
asking about you around the community center.&quot;

&quot;Margaret?&quot; Athena quickly deduced, a faint frown on
her face.

&quot;You know her?&quot; Erin looked a bit relieved.

&quot;Well I&#39;ve met her,&quot; Athena said thoughtfully, &quot;but
that&#39;s about it. What sort of questions was she
asking?&quot;

&quot;Mostly subtle sort of probing questions,&quot; Erin
answered, &quot;she seemed interested in your background,
that sort of thing.&quot;

Smiling faintly Athena said, &quot;That must have been
disappointing for her.&quot;

Erin chuckled, &quot;You like being a mystery?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Athena grinned as they reached the bar itself.
&quot;Catch you later,&quot; she excused herself, heading for
the apartments behind the nightclub.

&quot;Later,&quot; Erin agreed, heading to the bar instead.

Athena headed up to her suite, heading in and
stripping before jumping into the shower. One hot
scrub later she changed to black slacks and a white
shirt, simple but classic. Grabbing her jacket she
locked up and was off, heading over to check in with
her sister.

&quot;How was the movie night?&quot; Diana asked, the tawny
haired goddess wiping down the bar. The club was
packed with men and women, booze was flowing and
everyone was eagerly looking for a romantic
connection.

&quot;I had fun,&quot; Athena confessed, &quot;though I think it was
as much because of the kids as the quality of the
films.&quot;

Diana smiled, &quot;You really like them, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve got spirit,&quot; Athena shrugged, &quot;I enjoy that.&quot;

&quot;Oof,&quot; Circe gasped as she and Descent hauled in a keg
and heaved it back behind the bar. &quot;A little help,
maybe?&quot; the blonde haired sorceress bitched.

&quot;Gee, I just thought you were being butch,&quot; Diana said
innocently, batting her eyes.

Descent chuckled softly, the demoness having adopted
her more human appearance. &quot;You&#39;re not what I
expected,&quot; she said, long black hair flowing over he
shoulders.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Circe shrugged. She and Diana hooked the
keg up to the lines before filling up a mug and
passing it to a waiting customer, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Elizabeth nodded glumly, drinking from her
beer. The slim blonde looked her usual slutty self, a
low cut top and mini skirt showing almost her all, but
her heart didn&#39;t seem to be in it.

&quot;Still feeling guilty?&quot; Circe asked mildly.

&quot;Sort of,&quot; Elizabeth agreed with a sigh. She smiled
wryly, &quot;I didn&#39;t KNOW that Jess was dating someone,
but maybe I should have been listening when she said
no.&quot;

&quot;Jess wasn&#39;t exactly guiltless,&quot; Circe remarked wryly.
Not that Jess wasn&#39;t her friend, but she had to be
honest, too.

&quot;I wish there was someway to make up for it,&quot;
Elizabeth pouted.

&quot;Well...&quot; Circe was about to suggest something when
Elizabeth visibly brightened. &quot;What?&quot; she asked her
warily.

&quot;I know,&quot; Elizabeth said perkily, &quot;I&#39;ll seduce Alice
to even things up between them!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it, you ditz!&quot;

Elizabeth pouted, &quot;Meanie.&quot;

Over at the other side of the bar, a petite redhead
purred as she followed behind the taller, blacked
haired woman as they navigated to a table. &quot;Should I
get us some beer?&quot; Casey asked, catlike ears twitching
curiously.

&quot;Later,&quot; Nycole chuckled, looking across the table at
her companion. Dressed in black leather and wearing a
simple collar Casey had a wild, almost animalistic
beauty, one enhanced by the catlike features the
shape-shifter was letting show.

&quot;Is something wrong with my clothes, mistress?&quot; Casey
asked tentatively, her green eyes slightly wider with
fear.

&quot;No,&quot; Nycole shook her head, &quot;I was just thinking
about something. Do you remember what&#39;s important
about today?&quot;

Casey&#39;s lips curled up in a warm smile. &quot;Today is the
anniversary of the day we first met, and one year
after that the day you claimed me as your mate,&quot; she
purred.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you remembered,&quot; Nycole reached out to lay a
hand over Casey&#39;s, her white gloves bold over the
girl&#39;s dark leathers.

&quot;I&#39;d ever forget,&quot; Casey answered happily.

Nycole leaned over to kiss her, &quot;Good, because I have
plans to celebrate tonight.&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: Elizabeth first appears in Blood Sex and Magic,
as well as being a Daughters customer. Since she
played a big role in Jess and Alice&#39;s problems I
thought I should cover that somewhere. Nycole and
Casey appeared in a earlier Daughters episode and I&#39;m
batting around the idea of writing a lemon on them.
