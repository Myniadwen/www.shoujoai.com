<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 23 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Alyson lay in her bed staring at the ceiling, puzzling over Amy&#39;s words. 
Why would Nat feel responsible for her wounds? She herself did not even 
recall how she ended up laying in a pool of her own blood. She sat up in 
bed and blinked at her bare leg. Amy had cut off her pant leg just above 
the thigh and the sight of her underwear peeking through the fray edge 
embarrassed her immensely. Her eyes moved away from the tear to the 
large bandage that bound a good portion of her thigh, Blood could be 
seen seeping through the dressings in three distinct spots. She gingerly 
touched one of the patches of blood causing a shooting pain to run 
through her leg. The painkillers that Amy had given her earlier numbed 
the pain a fair amount but did not kill it entirely. Her eyes quickly 
glanced across her body trying to place what could have caused those 
wounds. She raised her good arm to look upon the bruises on her wrist.

(Remember you are mine and I can break you as quickly as I made you.)

A shudder of fear rushed through her body at the memory of her brother&#39;s 
anger and violent way he gripped her small arms. She set her hand 
sideways upon the bandage with the spots of blood between each figure 
and pictured three daggers, &quot;Nat...&quot;

(If I find you little friend interfering again I will make certain that 
she bleeds and her screams will be heard by the Lords themselves.)

Her mind snapped through the small haze of pain and she was suddenly to 
her feet. The moment her bad leg touched the floor it threatened to 
topple out from under herself. She needed to find Natalie as fast a 
possible and she was not going to let any amount of pain stop her. She 
clenched her teeth against the pain as she hobbled across the room. When 
she reached the wardrobe near the door she quickly opened it and grabbed 
a long sleeved spring jacket and some loose jogging pants and then 
stumbled about as she pulled off her torn pants and replaced them with 
the new ones and then pulled the jacket around her shoulder before 
leaving the room. Using the wall for support while slipping her good arm 
into the jacket and pulling the rest around her shoulders. She hoped she 
was not to late as she stumbled down the hall to the stairs. If anything 
happened to Natalie then... Alyson shook the thought from her mind and 
concentrated on the stair well before her and the girl that she felt so 
dearly for. 

*****

Natalie pulled the blankets off her bed to cover Kimberly. The redhead 
had cried herself to sleep and was now was silently snoozing with her 
head upon Natalie&#39;s lap. The girl&#39;s last words disturbed Natalie&#39;s mind 
deeply, she did not understand what would make Kimberly think that Kima 
would kill someone, but she needed to talk to Kima. She needed to know 
exactly what happened on that last day before her friend&#39;s 
disappearance. Carefully she slipped out from under the girl&#39;s head and 
swiftly replaced her leg with a pillow. Kimberly mumbled a little 
however made no signs of awakening. 

Natalie leaned close to the girl&#39;s ear, &quot;Sleep tight there kiddo.&quot; She 
whispered in a voice not even loud enough to wake to girl, &quot;I&#39;ll come 
check on you later.&quot; She lightly kissed the girl on the forehead then 
crept out of her room, being sure to keep her eyes on Kim as she slowly 
close the door. When the door was securely shut Natalie rapidly moved 
down the hall and descended a flight of stairs. She was in such a rush 
that she almost did not see the door to the second floor suddenly open 
and Alyson stumble into the stairwell. Natalie put her hand out in time 
to catch the side of the door and the wall, abruptly stopping her fall, 
leaving the girls nose to nose with each other. 

&quot;Uhhh... Hi...&quot; Natalie remarked uneasily with a twitchy smile as she 
pushed off the door to regain her distance from the girl. 

Alyson took a deep breath as her nerves began to settle, &quot;Nat, you 
scared the hell out of me!&quot; She exclaimed, holding tightly to the door&#39;s 
handle. In all her years of hunting shadows she found that Natalie had a 
hidden talent for stealth, no matter how good her ears were she was 
always startled by Natalie&#39;s sudden appearances out of nowhere. 
Sometimes she wondered if Natalie was truly human and if so maybe Amy 
was right about this girl not caring if she was inhuman as well.

&quot;Sorry, I was in a hurry.&quot; Natalie explained anxiously, stepping to the 
side to allow Alyson room to enter the stairwell. She quickly scanned 
the sling over Alyson&#39;s arm, &quot;Alyson, what are you doing out of bed?&quot; 
She inquired uneasy about the way the girl hopping in through the door.

&quot;We ne-&quot; Alyson started to say when she tripped and toppled forward. 

Natalie nimbly wrapped her arm around the girl to steady her. 
&quot;Careful!!&quot; Natalie helped Alyson stand, &quot;I think you should go back to 
bed.&quot; She lightly demanded taking another glance at the girl&#39;s bandages, 
&quot;How did you get down the hall anyways?&quot; She inquired glancing down the 
hall.

&quot;I needed to talk to you.&quot; Alyson panted, gripping her friend&#39;s shoulder 
for balance and glancing down the stairs she nearly fell down a moment 
ago, &quot;Did you see my brother?&quot; She inquired urgently, turning to face 
her friend. 

Natalie tensed at the question and blinked, &quot;I... I...&quot; She stammered, 
not sure how she should answer the question. 

&quot;Did you attack my brother?&quot; Alyson reiterated, this time with more 
insistency to her tone. 

&quot;Yes...&quot; Natalie replied, lowing her head in shame, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean 
too... but when he said he was going to take you away I got angry. I... 
I didn&#39;t know you were linked to him.&quot; She explained in distress.

Alyson did not seem fazed by the girls remarks, &quot;Did he walk away?&quot; She 
probed. 

Natalie was puzzled by her friends line of questioning, &quot;Yeah...&quot; She 
replied uncertainly, &quot;I thought it was because I&#39;d hurt him.&quot; 

&quot;He does not hurt easily.&quot; Alyson simply stated. In all her years of 
being with her brother he never walked away from a fight unless it was 
part of his plans to begin with. But how would he know that Natalie 
would attack him. Was he trying to send Alyson a message and if so what 
did it mean? Alyson&#39;s mind raced with worry as she played over the 
possibilities. No, there had to be another reason for his walking away. 
&quot;What was he doing when you fought him?&quot; She inquired feeling her calm 
beginning to slip. 

&quot;He was arguing with the Head Mistresses.&quot; Natalie explained still 
unsure why her friend was so interested in what happened. 

&quot;Then what?&quot; Alyson asked eagerly. 

&quot;Jenn and I saw them arguing&quot; Natalie continued, &quot;We snuck up to hear 
what they were talking about.&quot; 

&quot;Jennifer?&quot; Alyson was startled by this news, &quot;She was with you?&quot; There 
was urgency in her eyes that Natalie had never seen before. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Natalie stated in confusion, &quot;She got her allowance and wanted 
to get some things from the store. I took her to the one at the end of 
the road.&quot; 

&quot;What happened to Jennifer?&quot; Alyson demanded she seemed even more 
agitated by what she was hearing.

&quot;Well I was fighting with Drake while she hide behind some trees.&quot; 
Natalie resumed uncertain of where this was going, &quot;Then Melissa tore me 
off of Drake and Jenn came running out to see how I was. She seemed to 
have caught his attention and when she looked at him she started shaking 
and screaming. It was really strange. Almost as if she knew him or 
something.&quot; 

&quot;Where is she now?&quot;

&quot;Head Mistress Sophia is watching over her in the lobby.&quot; Natalie said 
perplexed by Alyson&#39;s sudden interest in Jenn, &quot;She should be still 
there. Why what is wrong?&quot; 

&quot;Take me to her.&quot; Alyson ordered, wrapping her good arm around Natalie&#39;s 
shoulders. 

&quot;A...alright...&quot; Natalie agreed, shifting her weight to help her friend 
down the stairs, &quot;Could you tell me what this is about?&quot; She asked, 
&quot;What is your brother up to?&quot;

&quot;I am not sure.&quot; Alyson answered simply. She did not offer another word. 

Natalie had a feeling that her friend knew more then she was letting on, 
but decided to let it go. She knew Alyson well enough to know when to 
drop something. Usually if she answers with &#39;I am not sure.&#39; it did not 
mean something good. Natalie wanted to learn more, but found that line 
was also a cue to change the subject, &quot;Listen Alyson.&quot; 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Alyson replied as she balanced herself between the railing and 
Natalie, her concentration on keeping her grip on the railing before 
her.

&quot;Do... you...&quot; Natalie took a deep breath as she tried to sort her word, 
&quot;Do you hate me?&quot; She blurted out quickly. 

Alyson grew even more silent as she thought over the question, &quot;No...&quot; 
She simply stated and again turned to silence. 

Natalie stopped on the landing between floors and stared down at her 
feet. There were only a few more stairs until the reached the lobby, 
however Natalie needed to get something of her chest without several 
prying eyes on them and now seemed the best time to do so, &quot;W... why did 
you come back to the dorm?&quot; She shakily inquired, unsure if she wanted 
to hear the answer. 

Alyson recalled her last words with her brother and how interested he 
was in Kim and Nat, &quot;I...&quot; She turned to look at Natalie who glanced at 
her at the same moment and they caught each other&#39;s eyes, &quot;I wanted to 
protect you.&quot; She finally stated flatly. 

Natalie&#39;s gaze intensified, &quot;Is that the only reason?&quot; She dug, &quot;Should 
I just give up on us or is there even the slightest chance?&quot; She boldly 
asked if things were going to end between them she wanted it to be fast 
and not drag out painfully. 

Alyson lowered her head, &quot;I do not know.&quot; She admitted, &quot;Maybe...&quot; She 
could feel her thoughts clash with each other. She still did not know if 
it was love that she was feeling for Natalie or just the need to protect 
the girl. The more she thought about the more confused she became and 
she wished she didn&#39;t need to decided it right then and there, &quot;C... can 
we talk about this later?&quot; She softly requested. 

&quot;This can not wait.&quot; Natalie glanced around the stairwell as she ran her 
free hand through her hair in frustration, &quot;I... I need to know how you 
feel about me...&quot; She set her eyes back on the girl before her, &quot;about 
us...&quot; 

Alyson seemed to be visibly shaken by Natalie&#39;s words, &quot;Nat... 
please...&quot; She struggled to keep her voice calm but Nat could hear the 
strain in her very words, &quot;You don&#39;t understand. There is a lot about me 
that you don&#39;t know.&quot; 

&quot;Then talk to me. I want to know everything.&quot; Natalie pushed, &quot;You have 
been avoiding me since you got here. It hurts so much seeing you look 
away every time I look at you. Will you please spe-&quot; 

&quot;STOP IT!!&quot; Alyson burst out; she could no longer keep hold of her 
emotions. She shoved Natalie away and leaned over the corner railing to 
support herself, placing her back to the girl, &quot;You just do not 
understand.&quot; She shakily stated as she gazed at the ground below her, 
&quot;You could never understand.&quot; 

&quot;You never let me try.&quot; Natalie snapped, &quot;You are always keeping to 
yourself. You never told me you were linked to your own brother. What 
exactly was your promise to him anyways?&quot; She demanded.

&quot;I can not tell you.&quot; Alyson replied frantically, &quot;You have no idea the 
things I&#39;ve had to face in my life.&quot; 

&quot;What could be so bad that you can not tell me?&quot; Natalie begged, &quot;What 
did you do that makes you think I won&#39;t understand? What is it? Did you 
sleep with that bastard?&quot; 

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; Alyson spun around and slapped Natalie across the face. 

The shock of Alyson&#39;s blow paralyse Natalie, she simply stared at her 
friend in dismay. Slowly she raised her hand to touch her cheek. A pain 
she had never felt before rose up inside of her heart, a mix of anguish 
and anger, &quot;Is that it then?&quot; She inquired coldly. 

&quot;Nat...&quot; Alyson was stunned by what she had just done, &quot;I... I...&quot; She 
began to tremble, &quot;I am not like this... I am stronger...&quot; She clenched 
her arms around herself, &quot;You don&#39;t understand. Drake, he... he&#39;s been 
there always... always protecting me... and I... I...&quot; 

&quot;Just tell me one thing.&quot; Natalie demanded coldly, &quot;Do you love that 
man?&quot; 

Alyson glanced at Natalie with fear filled eyes. She opened her mouth to 
answer but could not find her voice. It felt as if her mind had 
completely collapsed around itself leaving her weak and confused. She 
slowly shook her head and licked nervously at her lips, &quot;N... no... not 
like you...&quot; She rubbed the back of her neck feeling the heat of shame 
rising over her. 

The coldness in Natalie&#39;s eyes thawed and she stepped toward her friend, 
&quot;Alyson?&quot; She took the girl&#39;s hand in her&#39;s, &quot;Whatever he did to you. 
Whatever he said. I will protect you. I promise.&quot; 

Alyson&#39;s eyes filled with panic, &quot;NO!!!&quot; Alyson&#39;s cried out and 
frantically tried to push Natalie away, &quot;You can not promise. You 
CAN&#39;T!!!&quot; She screamed. 

Natalie was not going to let herself be shoved away again, &quot;Alyson stop 
it!&quot; She demanded as she tried to hold the girl&#39;s arm back and pinned 
the girl against the railing and looked her deeply in the eyes, &quot;I 
promise that I will always be there to protect you.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t promise...&quot; Alyson muttered helplessly, &quot;You can&#39;t...&quot; She 
weakened against Natalie&#39;s grip and rested her forehead on her friend&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;don&#39;t... promise...&quot; 

Suddenly Kris came rushing up the stairs, &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; She 
inquired glancing between the two girls, &quot;Natalie, what happened?&quot; She 
inquired.

&quot;Nothing...&quot; Natalie quickly backed away from Alyson, leaving her 
shaking against the railing.

Kris scanned Alyson&#39;s bandaged and hurried to the girl&#39;s side, &quot;Alyson, 
are you alright?&quot; She inquired glancing at the girl&#39;s wounds, &quot;What 
happened to you?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Natalie stated as she set her hand upon Alyson&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;Am I right?&quot; 

Alyson rubbed at her eyes and nodded, &quot;I am sorry.&quot; She gave a weak 
smile, &quot;This is really not like me.&quot; 

&quot;Seems to be one of those days.&quot; Kris remarked with half a smile, &quot;Here 
let me help you.&quot; She offered, taking Alyson by the arm and lifting the 
girl into her arms. 

&quot;Ummm....&quot; Alyson tried to protest as she was hauled off her feet. 

&quot;It is alright.&quot; Kris remarked as she started down the stairs, &quot;You are 
rather light in comparison to some.&quot; She stated with a slight chuckle. 

Alyson glanced up the stairs at Natalie who was still stood upon the 
landing, punching at the wall, &quot;Nat?&quot; She inquired anxiously and reached 
out an arm to the girl, &quot;Stay with me...&quot; She pleaded softly. 

Her words lightened Natalie&#39;s heart and she hurried down the stairs 
after the two girls, &quot;I&#39;m right with you.&quot; She stated as she hurried 
passed the girls, &quot;I&#39;ll get the door.&quot; She offered as she reached the 
bottom of the stairs and opened the door to the lobby.
