<h1>The Misadventures of Anna (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/misadv-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>It was the early hours of the night at Atlantic High. It was that time 
of year when it gets really dark, really early. The time of year that 
heralded the birth of winter. The time of year when passion between two 
people was at its zenith. 

The young blonde from Minnesota, Anna Michaels, stood silently against 
her locker, putting away her books for tomorrow. It was 5.30 in the 
evening, she was the only one here, and all of the other students had 
gone already. The only reason Anna had stayed behind was to do a little 
extra work for her History report. In the end, that work had dragged on 
for so long that she ended up being the only student left in the school. 
Or so she thought. 

Time stopped and increased all at once as Anna felt something shift from 
behind her. The blonde tried to look back around to see who it was, but 
she couldn&#39;t. In a flash, the stranger pressed the young woman up to the 
cold metal of the lockers, pinning Anna in place. Anna still couldn&#39;t 
tell who it was, but what she did know was that the person was female. 
She could feel the woman&#39;s breasts against her back. And Anna was also 
aware of how hard the woman&#39;s small nipples were, poking at her back. 
The woman leaned into a tense Anna, her lips nearing the blonde&#39;s ear, 
and began whispering in short tones. 

&quot;I told you I&#39;d finish what I started...&quot; 

Anna trembled, a warm feeling passing through her body, from the nape of 
her neck to the tips of her toes. She knew that voice implicitly, and 
its sensuality drove her wild. 

&quot;Holly...&quot; Anna mumbled innocently. 

Holly-Raine grinned, seeing and sensing that the she had the beautiful 
girl at her angelic mercy. With an unhidden lust, Holly ran her hands up 
the sides of Anna&#39;s smooth body, cursing the clothes that blocked her 
probing touch from soft rich flesh. Holly&#39;s hands continued to travel 
from place to place, working around Anna&#39;s unhidden navel, and down to 
her supple little ass. Anna&#39;s eyes rolled in her head, her petite sighs 
fuelling Holly&#39;s already well-stoked desire. 

Holly&#39;s smiled grew, and Anna&#39;s sighs followed the same idea, as soft 
hands begun moving again. The brunette slipped her hands under the 
fabric of Anna&#39;s small white t-shirt, and firmly grasped at her firm, 
ripe teen breasts. Holly began to knead them softly, yet all the same 
steadily, rubbing those stiffening little pink nipples between her 
fingers. Again, Anna felt that sensation generate at her crotch, a warm, 
dull ache, and even more that, a cool wetness. When she was in the arms 
of this girl, it seemed like Anna was as fragile as glass. 

&quot;You&#39;re not wearing a bra...&quot; Holly said sneakily. &quot;Naughty girl.&quot; 

Anna&#39;s eyes slipped shut and her pussy just seemed to get wetter. 
&quot;S-Stop... talking to me... like that...&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; Holly leaned in closer, and began nibbling at the sweet flesh of 
Anna&#39;s neck, still teasing her sensitive nipples under her shirt. She 
broke away just long enough to continue to speak. &quot;Don&#39;t you like it, 
Anna...?&quot; 

Anna couldn&#39;t say yes or no. How could she respond when Holly&#39;s gifted 
hands manipulated her breasts like that? The blonde bit her lip to keep 
herself from moaning. Did Holly have this much power over her? Holly 
went back to servicing Anna&#39;s neck, tasting, licking and kissing it, all 
the while, her hands continued to play with Anna&#39;s small and tight 
chest. 

One of those hands slipped out of Anna&#39;s shirt, then back down into her 
light blue mini-skirt. Anna managed to open one of her eyes, and watched 
the outline of Holly&#39;s hand, working its way into her panties with 
abandon. She could only writhe as Holly&#39;s middle finger ran down the 
line of her damp slit. 

Anna&#39;s head lulled back onto Holly&#39;s shoulder. &quot;H-Holly...&quot; 

The Texan brunette pulled back from Anna&#39;s now saliva coated neck, and 
smiled, savouring the feel of Anna&#39;s warm wetness on her fingers. She 
cupped her hand and began a slow methodical rub; over and over Anna&#39;s 
most sensitive of all areas. &quot;Anna... I want make you happy... I want 
you to be mine...&quot; 

Anna&#39;s eyelids flickered and her breath quickened. &quot;Oh Holly...&quot; 

&quot;Anna...?&quot; 

Though a voice called out, Anna wasn&#39;t listening. &quot;...I&#39;m yours, 
Holly...&quot; 

&quot;Anna!&quot; 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

&quot;Anna!&quot; 

The blonde girl&#39;s eyes broke open with a start, her mind cracking back 
into reality. Anna blinked a bit and tried to remember where she was. 
She was at the dinner table with her mom, hunched over a bowl of cereal. 
Her face was red from embarrassment and surprise. Anna could not believe 
that she had just fantasized about Holly-Raine while she was having 
breakfast. But then, after what happened yesterday, who could blame her? 
She hoped to good god that she didn&#39;t mumble anything in front of her 
mother. The last thing she needed was to have to `explain&#39; herself. 

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, honey?&quot; The older woman asked. &quot;Aren&#39;t you hungry?&quot; 

Anna could barely hear what her mother was saying. All the thoughts and 
emotions swirling in her brain seemed to be screaming all at once. The 
young girl from Minnesota slumped her head against her palm and she 
poked her large spoon in and out of her cereal. It was a brand new 
morning, brand new day, but for Anna, it felt as though time had stopped 
yesterday. 

The young woman felt her heart tie up in knots from thinking about her 
encounter with Holly-Raine. It all happened so fast. One minute they 
were kissing and embracing each other, the next Holly had her doubled 
over in a delirious stupor of passion. Was Anna really like that? She 
never classified herself as a lesbian. Sure, she never had a boyfriend, 
but she never had a girlfriend either. Then Holly came around with her 
cute little self and threw poor Anna for six. Every time she thought 
about Holly-Raine, a twisting, rending feeling appeared in the core of 
her stomach. Anna really couldn&#39;t regard it any other way. It was almost 
like... a sensation of yearning, of loss. Deep down, at the core of it 
all, Anna wished greatly that Holly finished what she started 
previously. 

&quot;...Anna?&quot; Her mother prodded again. &quot;...Is something wrong?&quot; 

That, Anna managed to hear. &quot;Mom? Did you say something?&quot; 

&quot;You haven&#39;t eaten much.&quot; Anna&#39;s mother flicked open her newspaper. &quot;And 
you&#39;ve been very quiet, even for you. Did something happen at your new 
school?&quot; 

Anna shook her head absently. &quot;No. Everyone was great to me, Mom.&quot; &quot;So 
what&#39;s the matter?&quot; 

Anna blushed privately. How could she tell her mother what she had done 
with Holly-Raine last night? 

&quot;Nothing&#39;s the matter, Mom. I guess I&#39;m still a little nervous, is all.&quot; 

&quot;Okay...&quot; Anna&#39;s mother said that unconvincingly. She really did worry 
about Anna a lot. Ever since her promotion, the two of them had been 
seeing much less of each other. &quot;Please just take care of yourself, 
sweetie. Try not to worry too much.&quot; 

Anna nodded. &quot;I will, Mom. May I be excused?&quot; 

&quot;Of course, sweetheart.&quot; 

With that, Anna put down her spoon and pushed her chair backwards from 
the dining table. Anna quickly stood upright and picked up her book bag 
from next to the chair leg. After saying a quick goodbye to her mother, 
Anna strode out of the dining room and walked through the hallway 
towards the door. Right now, she didn&#39;t feel like talking to anyone. The 
only person she wanted to talk to right now was Holly. 

********** 

Holly-Raine, the brown-haired wonder with a penchant for seduction, 
skipped and bounded through the suburban street that led into Atlantic 
High. There was a smile on her face, and a spring in her step, and that 
joy was not lost on the two friends walking alongside her, Jenny and 
Summer. While Jenny stayed neutrally ignorant of Holly&#39;s bliss, Summer 
guessed why she was so happy. She had seen Holly and Anna walk off with 
each other yesterday, and by that she realized Holly had probably scored 
with her. Not that she was surprised or anything. Very few girls (of 
that nature) could resist Holly. She had quite a knack for alluring shy 
women. And, y&#39;know, anyone with a pulse. 

Summer didn&#39;t wait long to find out if she was right. &quot;Holly.&quot; 

The blissful Holly-Raine looked back at her friend. &quot;Yeah, Summer?&quot; 

&quot;Why are you so... um... giddy...?&quot; 

Holly smiled deviously (though she didn&#39;t intend to) and that more or 
less confirmed it. &quot;That would be telling! Besides, you should be happy. 
You keep telling me how I was always moping around ever since Sharon 
left last month.&quot; 

Jenny then looked around. &quot;Oh yeah, Sharon. When is she coming back?&quot; 

&quot;Tomorrow.&quot; Holly said quietly. &quot;She is coming back tomorrow.&quot; 

Holly let the talk that Jenny and Summer projected swirl around her. 
Suddenly she was thinking about something more important. Sharon 
Daniels, her girlfriend for the last three years, was coming back on 
Wednesday. And as easily as that, Holly began to picture her girlfriend 
in her mind&#39;s eye. Sharon was moderately tall at a healthy 5&#39; 2&#39;. She 
had such lush, long locks of dark black hair, and figure of dynamite to 
match. Sharon was always so confident and determined, a trait that Holly 
was really drawn to. And even more than that, Sharon was EXTREMELY 
protective of Holly. Or, more accurately, possessive. Sharon did have a 
tendency to become jealous any time someone went near Holly-Raine. But, 
in spite of that, Holly did love Sharon. It may seem strange, 
considering that Holly was sleeping with other people (e.g. Anna), but 
what she felt for Sharon was different. It was an affection that she 
valued; she valued it enough to give up her lust for other women. 

Then, where did that leave Anna? 

Holly-Raine did like Anna. In fact, Holly had never been as attracted to 
a girl as much as Anna. The only person Holly found sexier was Sharon. 
And to be fair, Holly did want to finish what she started last night. 
But... that was just the problem. She couldn&#39;t do anything with Anna 
when Sharon got back. It wasn&#39;t that she was afraid of losing her 
(Sharon had caught Holly many times before, but had always forgiven her) 
but Holly was just too excited by Sharon&#39;s return to really think about 
anything else. Sure, she was happy that she scored with Anna, but... 
Sharon... 

Speak of the devil... 

&quot;Hey. Holly. You miss me?&quot; 

Holly-Raine blinked in surprise. She knew whose voice that was. The 
young brunette looked back around her, as did Jenny and Summer, and they 
all gasped in surprise as their youthful eyes caught sight of 
raven-haired Sharon Daniels for the first time in a month. 

Holly was speechless. &quot;S-Sharon. You&#39;re back?&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; The confident girl nodded. &quot;So what, are you gonna come over 
here or are you gonna leave me hanging, eh?&quot; 

Holly-Raine giggled childishly and dashed towards the dark haired girl. 
Holly literally threw herself into Sharon&#39;s arms and gave of a deep sigh 
of satisfaction, finally back her girlfriend&#39;s embrace after a whole 
month apart. Though they were out in the middle of the street, and 
people were eyeing them over like they were a pair of lunatics, Holly 
really didn&#39;t seem to care. The two of them stayed like for a few 
minutes, so Jenny decided to infer when the silence between the four of 
them was getting awkward. 

&quot;Glad to have you back, Sharon.&quot; She said. &quot;You&#39;ve missed a few things 
though.&quot; 

Sharon nodded but gave them a warning look that more or less said `make 
yourself scarce&#39;. Both Summer and Jenny got the message and continued 
walking toward Atlantic High, while Holly stayed wrapped in Sharon&#39;s 
clinch. 

&quot;I missed you, Sharon.&quot; Holly said, a slight tremor in her voice. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Sharon grinned a little, and then drew Holly in a little bit 
closer. The grin across her lips did not fade, as she slipped her hands 
down the coffee-haired girl&#39;s back, then further onwards. Sharon&#39;s 
nimble hands reached out and squeezed the globes of Holly&#39;s ass, 
relishing the soft velvety feel. &quot;I missed you too...&quot; 

Fate always did have that little twist. 

********** 

The young blonde from Minnesota, Anna, strolled through the gates of 
Atlantic High with her little book bag at her side and a nervous smile 
on her lips. Though it seemed so simple, bringing herself back to this 
school was a big task. Coming back here meant that she&#39;d see Holly. But 
that was what she wanted. All the events that had taken place yesterday 
had put Anna in such a funk. Though it might have seemed... silly to be 
so expectant, Anna felt a joy inside herself from the possibility of 
being with Holly-Raine on that level once more. 

To be one with her... simply to touch her... Anna did not know what she 
was experiencing right now, nor could she explain it, but even she could 
recognize desire when given half the opportunity. Anna was yearning and 
burning for auburn-haired seductress, and there was very little that 
could pop her off that joyous cloud nine she was riding. 

Or so it was believed. 

Anna looked around the outer courtyard for any sign of Holly-Raine. She 
knew that the brunette liked to hang out around the benches during the 
morning, Holly had said as much when the two of them went shopping 
yesterday. But Holly wasn&#39;t sitting by any of them. 

&quot;Maybe I&#39;m a little early.&quot; Anna disappointedly mumbled to herself. 

It was at that point that Summer and Jenny walked through the school 
gates and into the schoolyard itself. Jenny was the first to notice Anna 
standing by the benches, so reflexively called out to her. 

&quot;Hey, Anna!&quot; Jenny called out loudly. &quot;Over here!&quot; 

The blonde girl swung around when she heard her name being called out, 
it wasn&#39;t Holly, but rather two of her new friends, Jenny and Summer. 
Anna smiled as best she could (you know who she was hoping for) and 
walked over to the two other girls. 

&quot;Summer, Jenny.&quot; Anna said politely as she reached them. &quot;It&#39;s nice to 
see you two.&quot; 

Again, Jenny was the first to speak. &quot;Sure, sure, sure. So what are you 
doing on your own out here?&quot; 

&quot;I was looking for Holly.&quot; Anna felt her soul tie up in knots from 
saying that sweet name. &quot;Have you seen her around? We... have work to do 
on our History project.&quot; 

Summer smiled secretively. &quot;You didn&#39;t get much work done last night?&quot; 

Anna blinked out of surprise. That was a bit of a weird comment. Not 
really what Summer said, but the way she said it. It was as if she knew 
something. Did...did Summer really know something? But how? Anna was 
sure that Holly would not have told anyone about last night. How could 
Summer have figured something out? 

&quot;H-How...&quot; Anna&#39;s voice began to tremble a little. &quot;W-What do you mean?&quot; 

Summer waved Anna off with a flick of the hand and gave a knowing smile. 
However, her next comment was directed at Jenny. &quot;Jenny, could you go 
get us a couple chocolate bars from the vending machine inside? I 
wouldn&#39;t normally ask, but it&#39;s right by Mr. Larson&#39;s geography room and 
I don&#39;t want him grilling me about my homework.&quot; 

Jenny wiggled her nose a little in mock irritation. &quot;Fine. You&#39;re going 
to have to cough up a bit of money though. You already owe me twenty 
bucks, remember?&quot; 

&quot;Fine, fine...&quot; Summer said, fishing some change out of her jacket 
pocket. In a few seconds Jenny was given the money she needed. &quot;Take 
your time, okay? I can wait.&quot; 

Jenny wasn&#39;t stupid. She knew that Summer was trying to get rid of her. 
But, whatever she needed to talk about, Jenny really couldn&#39;t refuse. 
Best friends do that kind of thing for each other. Jenny nodded as she 
grasped the spare cash and walked over to the main building, past the 
other students and the odd teacher here and there. 

Now that Jenny was gone, Summer beamed a small, caring smile at Anna. 
Though Anna herself was a bit curious as to what this all meant. She 
didn&#39;t know Summer all that well; she had only met the other girl at 
lunch yesterday. Though, Anna really didn&#39;t know Holly all that well 
either, so, this shouldn&#39;t have been too much of an issue. She said 
nothing, but what Summer did do was point at one of the benches at the 
edge of the courtyard, obviously to sit down. Anna nodded to confirm 
that she understood, and the two girls ambled slowly to the highlighted 
bench. 

Anna took a seat on the attached seat, while Summer heaved herself 
upwards and sat on the table itself, her feet planted firmly on the seat 
of the bench. The two were sitting next to each other but facing 
forward, looking out across the front stone clearing of Atlantic High. 
There was a small silence between the two of them, and when it became 
obvious that Anna would do nothing to break that silence, Summer filled 
in the blanks for her. 

&quot;You like Holly a lot, don&#39;t you?&quot; 

Again, Anna felt that rending feel inside her core. That sense of 
craving; of lustful yet loving thirst. Just from the simple mention of 
Holly&#39;s name. &quot;I do. S-She&#39;s been a good friend to me since yesterday.&quot; 

Summer shook her head sagely. &quot;That isn&#39;t what I mean.&quot; 

&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot; 

A nostalgic feeling passed through Summer. &quot;Holly had her way with you 
last night, didn&#39;t she?&quot; 

Anna gasped, her eyes widening to their limits. Summer *did* know 
something. But why would Holly tell someone else about what happened 
between them? It wasn&#39;t that Anna was ashamed of what happened, quite 
the opposite. But she still did not want other people told about it 
either. It was their business and no one else&#39;s. 

Anna&#39;s head lowered a bit. &quot;She told you...&quot; 

&quot;Nah.&quot; Summer confirmed. &quot;I could see it in your eyes, that glow, that 
excitement. I remember what it was like... kinda like magic...&quot; 

Now Anna was confused. &quot;You mean... you and... Holly?&quot; 

&quot;You didn&#39;t think you were the only one, did ya? Holly&#39;s been with a lot 
of us. That girl&#39;s so damn cute it&#39;s hard not to, y&#39;know?&quot; 

Just like that, the wind was taken out of Anna&#39;s sails. Maybe it wasn&#39;t 
as special to Holly as it was to her. Did Holly see it all as a bit of 
fun? Summer took a glance at Anna and realized that she might have upset 
the sweet teen. &quot;Sorry if I&#39;ve broken your thunder. But I think you 
should know not to read too much into it. Don&#39;t go hurting yourself, 
Anna. &#39;Cause Holly always ends up with *her*.&quot; 

Anna was just about to question who &#39;her&#39; was, but she didn&#39;t have to. 
Anna saw Summer looking off into the distance with a jealous smile, and 
Anna followed the gaze. It led her to see Holly, walking rather closely 
next to a slightly taller woman, her long dark hair flowing elegantly by 
the slight breeze. The two walked inside the main building of Atlantic, 
unaware that Anna and Summer were sitting twenty metres away from them. 

As easily as snow hits Canada, the cloud of realization descended around 
Anna. From that look in Holly&#39;s eyes, that look of fulfilment and love, 
it was easy to see the connection. And just like that, all of Anna&#39;s 
expectations hit the floor. &quot;W-Who is she?&quot; 

&quot;Sharon.&quot; Summer said slowly. &quot;Holly&#39;s girlfriend. She left last month 
to visit her sick grandparents in Sacramento. Sharon was supposed to 
arrive tomorrow, but I guess she couldn&#39;t keep away from Holly any 
longer.&quot; 

Anna couldn&#39;t believe it. Holly had a girlfriend? &quot;Then... then why did 
she...?&quot; 

&quot;Sleep with you?&quot; Summer giggled. &quot;That&#39;s our Holly. She&#39;s always had 
her hands in a lot of pies. We&#39;ve all been there at some point, right? 
It&#39;s just her nature. I guess you can call her an &#39;innocent slut&#39; or 
something.&quot; 

It still didn&#39;t make Anna feel any better. &quot;...Holly... I just... I have 
to know for sure.&quot; 

Anna quickly stood up and walked towards the main building in the same 
way that Holly and Sharon did. In fact she was so caught up in all this 
that she didn&#39;t notice that she passed by Jenny along the way. Jenny 
gave a quick &#39;hi&#39; to the blonde, but Anna took no notice as she walked 
into the main building. Jenny simply shrugged and walked over to Summer, 
who was still sitting at the bench. 

&quot;What&#39;s up with Anna?&quot; Jenny asked, with three chocolate bars in her 
hands. 

Summer shook her head. &quot;The usual thing that happens. Nothing new.&quot; 

********** 

&quot;Why are you back here so early...?&quot; 

Sharon smiled secretively as she dragged Holly-Raine along by the wrist. 
The two of them darted through the corridors and past the other girls at 
the school, who were chatting and talking amongst themselves. The 
black-haired girl was obviously leading Holly somewhere. Though it was 
true that Holly was glad that Sharon was back, she didn&#39;t understand why 
she came a day early. 

Sharon&#39;s eyes studied the classroom doors she came across. &quot;Does it 
really matter? I&#39;m back now, that&#39;s all that matters. Now... I think I 
need a taste of what I&#39;ve been missing these past few weeks...&quot; 

Eventually, Sharon came across the right door in that hallway. It 
belonged to Mrs. Carmen, the music teacher. Of course, she was away on 
sick leave (pregnancy) for the last three months and her room was free. 
As usual, the door was unlocked, so Sharon quickly slipped inside and 
shut the door, locking it from the inside. Now that they were away from 
prying eyes and ears, Sharon turned back around and gave her girl the 
eye over. 

&quot;You look even more gorgeous, Holly.&quot; 

Though Holly wasn&#39;t quite as naive as the girls she had seduced in her 
time, Sharon&#39;s compliments did make her feel really light-headed. 
&quot;...Sharon...&quot; 

Sharon gave the room one last check over to make sure no one else was 
there (or that anyone could see the two of them, it was always a 
possibility) and then walked over to her little Holly, the cute 
brown-haired angel. The dark-haired girl wrapped her arm around 
Holly-Raine&#39;s lower waist, and drew her in close, so close that their 
breasts pressed up against each other. Holly let off a childish giggle. 
Sharon always did know how to make Holly melt. 

&quot;I missed you, Sharon.&quot; Holly said deeply. 

The sentiment was not lost on Sharon. But she didn&#39;t want to waste time 
*talking* about it. &quot;Then if you really missed me... show me how much 
you missed me.&quot; 

Holly did not even bother to question Sharon as the other girl moved in 
for a kiss. And one hell of a kiss at that. Holly relinquished a sharp 
gasp of surprise, her sounds muffled as Sharon claimed the auburn-haired 
girl&#39;s lips for her own. Holly&#39;s head tilted back, and her sweet green 
eyes locked closed as Sharon kissed her. It was such a missed feeling, 
to be kissed by Sharon like that. The slightly taller girl wrapped her 
arms around Holly&#39;s small, diminutive frame, letting her nimble hands 
roam freely, finally grasping at that tight little ass of Holly&#39;s. 
Sharon squeezed the twin globes with glee, one cheek in each hand. Ever 
since they met, Sharon had a fetish-like fixation on Holly&#39;s behind. 
Holly sighed once more, loving the feel of Sharon&#39;s swift hands claiming 
her more-than-cute backside. Almost out of reflex, Holly intensified 
their passionate kiss, parting her lips straightforwardly. Of course 
Sharon wasted no time with this, slipping her tongue between Holly&#39;s 
lips and into her mouth. Holly&#39;s mouth was forced completely open by 
Sharon&#39;s hot and wet digit, and she shuddered from the sensation of it. 

For a few minutes, Sharon continued to passionately kiss Holly-Raine, 
another of those little traits that made the young woman so special. 
Nobody could French like Holly could. Soon Sharon reluctantly released 
her grip on Holly&#39;s ass, and began to fumble with the small buttons that 
were fixing Holly&#39;s blouse together. Holly whimpered teasingly at the 
loss of contact, but still, let Sharon do what she wanted. Sharon 
struggled to undo the first button, and as a result, she broke her kiss 
with Holly to get it out of the way. 

{Damn buttons.} Sharon thought. Now she had the gift of being able to 
see what she was doing, Sharon unbuttoned the blouse, one button after 
another, until it was open completely. Holly pulled it off as quickly as 
she could, leaving herself topless save for her snow-coloured bra. 
Sharon&#39;s grin returned to her, and she cupped Holly&#39;s perky little tits 
in with her hands, squeezing them ever so delicately. Holly moaned a 
little from the action. To have Sharon&#39;s cool, soothing hands on her 
breasts was so wonderful. In an instant Sharon began a slow kneading of 
Holly&#39;s breasts, lifting, squeezing and evaluating. It was almost like 
fruit sellers judging the weight of their &#39;melons&#39;. Sharon continued 
this, loving the sound of her little Holly&#39;s frustrated moans. Sharon 
could tell that she didn&#39;t just want her breasts to be played with; she 
wanted a set of teeth biting and tantalizing them. Truth be told, she 
loved those frustrated cries of Holly. To make her baby-girl beg, plead 
and yearn for her pleasure was another of Sharon&#39;s quirks. 

Well, what mi&#39;lady asks for, mi&#39;lady gets... 

The two hands of Sharon&#39;s circled around Holly&#39;s body and unfastened the 
bra strap holding it together. There was no real effort needed, Sharon 
had unclipped Holly&#39;s bra enough times by now. In a few seconds it fell 
to the floor like a leaf in autumn, the small article losing its 
function. Just for a short amount of moments Sharon took the time to 
observe Holly&#39;s ample bosom. So well rounded, so soft and touchable. 
Those pink little nipples adoring them like twin crystals hanging in a 
cloudy sky. Though Sharon had thought and said this a million times, 
Holly-Raine had to have the most perfect body ever (of course, she 
hasn&#39;t met Anna yet but, whatever). 

Holly&#39;s emerald green eyes looked downwards, to see Sharon marvelling at 
her breasts wide-eyed glee. To say that Holly was feeling a bit 
impatient was an understatement. &quot;...Well...?&quot; 

Sharon&#39;s gleaming smile doubled up at the sound of Holly&#39;s drawn, 
desperate voice. The girl with the black hair pushed Holly back so she 
was leaning against a desk, and then Sharon&#39;s head slanted downwards a 
little. Then with a sexy smack of the lips, Sharon sucked Holly&#39;s cerise 
nub into her mouth. Holly let out a cute &#39;oooh&#39; sound as Sharon&#39;s wet 
lips curled around her nipple, which was already stiffened from all the 
excitement. Sharon suckled at the fleshy gem like a newborn, expressing 
her approval with light moans of her own, to match Holly&#39;s. Her lips 
widened to accommodate more of Holly&#39;s breast, after which Sharon pulled 
back and dragged her tongue over, up and down the exquisite mound. 
Sharon proceeded to plant small kisses against the creamy flesh of 
Holly&#39;s tits, occasionally leaving the odd love bite here and there. 
Holly&#39;s head started to roll and she openly began moaning, as Sharon 
worked her patented breast treatment on her. The wetness at her lowest 
opening couldn&#39;t be any more frank than it was. Sharon could clearly 
smell that sweet, sweet scent of a woman&#39;s arousal. There was nothing 
else in the world that was quite like it. 

But for now, Sharon sustained her attention on Holly-Raine&#39;s chest, 
alternating between the left and right nipple every few seconds. Holly 
continued to moan as Sharon continued to nibble at her sensitive nubs. 
In time, Sharon managed to pull herself away from Holly&#39;s breasts, 
giving her lips a brief lick. She marvelled at her handy work. Holly&#39;s 
nipples were so swollen and hard, her chest rising and falling with 
every deep breath she took. The droplets of Sharon&#39;s saliva coated 
Holly&#39;s cherry-like nipples and ran slick over her aureoles. It 
glistened in the sunlight that peered between the curtains of the far 
window, such a sexy sight for Sharon to behold. 

Sharon smiled again, kissed the middle of Holly-Raine&#39;s naval, and then 
dragged her tongue up that tight velvety skin, up her stomach, between 
her well-serviced breasts, up along the outline of her neck, all the way 
up to the chin and then to the lips. Holly tried hard to stifle her 
playful giggles as Sharon thrust her tongue back inside her mouth, 
darting and probing its recesses without fail. Holly let go of the desk 
she was leaning on, and wrapped her arms around Sharon&#39;s neck. By now 
Sharon was standing upright, and after enjoy her kiss for just a bit 
longer, the black-haired girl slid her hand back down Holly&#39;s body and 
inside her jeans shorts. Sharon&#39;s probing hand wrenched into the 
confinement of Holly&#39;s trademark cotton panties. It was already so wet 
down there. Sharon rubbed at Holly&#39;s sodden-with-wetness opening, 
curling her middle and wedding ring fingers against her pussy lips. 

Holly gave off a muffled cry as Sharon&#39;s hand touched her most private 
area, but she sighed when Sharon removed that hand. Sharon broke their 
kiss, then gazed at her hand. Her fingers were even slicker than they 
felt. 

&quot;You&#39;re so wet, Holly.&quot; Sharon mused over this. 

Holly-Raine couldn&#39;t even speak; all she did was nod to her lover&#39;s 
declaration. Sharon could see that her little Holly was more excited 
than usual. Of course, a horny Holly-Raine wasn&#39;t exactly a new concept, 
but Sharon&#39;s moist fingers seemed to speak differently. Well now, she 
couldn&#39;t let Holly wait any longer then, could she? 

&quot;Holly...&quot; Sharon spoke the name so sexually. &quot;Turn around.&quot; 

Holly just nodded and did as her love asked, turning around swiftly. 
Sharon leaned over Holly&#39;s back, and guided the brown-haired girl&#39;s 
hands to the desk. Now Holly was leaning over the desk, her ass 
indirectly flashing Sharon so cutely. Sharon beamed that trademark grin 
of hers, and gave Holly&#39;s bottom a quick, playful slap, eliciting a 
frivolous chuckle from the girl. Sharon then curled her arms around 
Holly&#39;s waist, using her long fingers to undo the buckle around her 
jeans shorts. It came undone in no time flat, and so Sharon proceeded to 
remove it. Holly assisted this by stepping out of them as they came down 
her legs. The jeans shorts were now gone, shortly followed by the 
panties, all of which went into the pile of Holly&#39;s clothes on the 
floor. Now was totally naked aside from her shoes and socks. 

&quot;Spread your legs a bit, sweetheart.&quot; Sharon asked. 

Holly did just that, pushing apart her feet to shoulder&#39;s width. 
Perfect. Sharon crouched down again; just enough so that Holly&#39;s opening 
met her at eye level from behind. Before she did anything, Sharon took a 
couple of seconds to observe her prey. Holly had such beautiful folds. 
There was no way a sane human being could resist them. As Sharon parted 
Holly&#39;s nether lips with her right hand, Holly shut her eyes to prepare 
for what was coming. Of course, no matter what precautions she took, 
Holly was still rocked to her core as Sharon&#39;s long, warm, moist tongue 
drove itself inside her. 

Green eyes bugged out, grips on desks tightened, and light moans turned 
into desperate cries. Holly&#39;s angelic body trembled and quaked as 
Sharon&#39;s tongue split apart the creases of receptive tissue within 
Holly-Raine&#39;s honey pot, darting and probing the saccharine teen&#39;s inner 
flesh. Sharon herself moaned as she received that alluring taste of 
Holly&#39;s love juices. The smell, the feel, the taste of it, was such a 
wonderful experience. Sharon pushed her tongue inside of Holly as far as 
her mouth would allow, then flicked and toyed with the inner nooks and 
crannies. Holly&#39;s face twisted with pleasure and she struggled to hold 
back her cries of ecstasy, her hips and legs juddering. Sharon&#39;s tongue 
began to work systematically, shifting from a certain area to another, 
slipping out of Holly&#39;s pussy then back up again every time she needed a 
breath of air. 

While her tongue impaled and withdrew itself repetitively, Sharon&#39;s 
hands meandered back up to Holly&#39;s tight ass, squeezing the soft cheeks 
as best she could. Holly&#39;s back arched in that instant, the legs she was 
standing on now seemed to be losing their strength. 

A trail of Holly-Raine&#39;s juice slipped down Sharon&#39;s cheek, but she 
didn&#39;t bother to wipe it off. The only thing on Sharon&#39;s mind was 
delivering the sweetest gift she could to her auburn-haired angel. Holly 
could barely control herself now. Her head thrashed about her shoulders, 
her brown hair whipping around as she did so. Soon her hips were 
involuntarily bucking against Sharon&#39;s face, as the taller woman 
devoured her taut opening. Holly pushed back against Sharon&#39;s agile 
tongue, trying as hard as she could to get it deeper inside. Her teeth 
grit down and her pussy began to spasm, the musk in the room taking on a 
whole new level. 

Subsequently, Holly&#39;s mouth opened widely and bellowed a short, deep, 
almost wracking cry of blissful release as the dam finally burst open in 
a haze of glory. Holly-Raine&#39;s body twisted and squirmed, collapsing 
onto the desk as a powerful orgasm took her over. Her bucking hips and 
trembling legs decelerated from fast and erratic to slow and consistent. 
Her breathing however, was still quick and strong, as the orgasm died 
down in intensity. Sharon slowly removed her cum-soiled mouth from 
Holly&#39;s crack, licking her lips to draw in more of that strangely 
enjoyable taste. 

The black-haired girl pulled back and stood up, admiring Holly&#39;s 
trembling body. It meant a lot to Sharon for her to know that she could 
give such pleasure to a girl as gorgeous as Holly-Raine. Slowly, Holly 
managed to turn around on the desk, leaning back. She looked up at 
Sharon, her big green eyes full of contentment and happiness. Sharon 
leaned over her; the two came face-to-face, and stared longingly at each 
other. 

&quot;Sharon...&quot; Holly said, her voice slightly weaker. &quot;...Oh, Sharon...&quot; 

The girl in question said nothing, simply because nothing needed to be 
said. Sharon smiled at Holly once more, and then drew her into another 
kiss. Holly released another muffled moan into Sharon&#39;s mouth as they 
kissed, the teen tasting her own wetness on Sharon&#39;s lips. The two just 
stayed like that, kissing and expressing the affection they felt for 
each other. And they believed that they were the only ones who were 
aware of what had taken place. 

But they weren&#39;t. Someone else just happened to realize what happened. 
And that was Anna. She didn&#39;t mean to pry or snoop, but she just 
followed Holly to see if they could talk. Sharon locked the door and 
Anna assumed the two of them would be out in a second. But then... all 
of that happened and all of Anna&#39;s hopes for something between herself 
and Holly went out the window. Summer was right. Anna&#39;s head lowered, 
her blonde hair shielding the sadness in her eyes from view. She wasn&#39;t 
heartbroken, it was just that Anna just felt so... disappointed. In 
Holly and in herself. Did she really fool herself into believing that 
she and Holly could be together...? 

At that moment, a young girl who was passing by just happened to catch 
sight of the beautiful waif that was Anna. This girl was blonde, like 
Anna was, but her hair was a little darker, a sort of ^Ndirty blonde&#39; 
tone. Her body was cleaved into a cute form, and her eyes sparkled a 
very potent dark blue. Of course her smile was much more expressive than 
the rest of her body. In a second, she called out to Anna. 

&quot;Well, well, well.&quot; She said. &quot;What have we here?&quot; 

Anna could barely speak after what she just overheard. &quot;I... um...&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re Anna Michaels, right?&quot; 

To that, Anna nodded. &quot;Y-Yes...&quot; 

The girl winked at Anna. &quot;Hiya. The name&#39;s Shannon Marson. Nice to meet 
ya.&quot; 

Anna smiled a bit, and then shyly greeted Shannon. Shannon herself had 
quite a few thoughts running through her head, ones that involved Anna. 
Maybe it was for the best that Anna was acutely unaware of the impact 
this girl was about to have on her life.
