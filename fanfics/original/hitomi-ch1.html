<h1>Aishiteru Hitomi!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Monday morning, 7.15. Beams of radiating sunlight emanated from the 
long double glazed window in the room of Hitomi Benisaki. The platinum 
blonde stirred and under the warm rays, heralding the new day, and a 
brand new start to the week. Hitomi tiredly sat upright as she yawned, 
softly rubbing the sleep out of her eyes, adjusting them to the 
mirror. By the standards of her calculating brain, she looked 
terrible. The platinum blonde looked again, and confirmed it. Her eyes 
were a pale red, her body seemed withered and drawn out, and she was 
constantly yawning. Hitomi then exhaled exhaustedly as she remembered 
why she looked and felt so poorly. She had been up all night on the 
piano, practicing for the recital on Thursday. When was much younger, 
she loved to play the piano, it was something she was really talented 
at, aside from school, so it was very important to her. She played for 
the school at one point, in a huge concert to raise money for an 
extended wing, and everyone was taken by her skill on the piano. On 
that day though, she meet a very famous pianist from Vienna, and he 
told her that her talent was exceptional, and she should never give up 
hope of taking her skills to the next level. Of course she thought she 
would not go anywhere as a musician, but she found that many people 
thought the same thing, including her mom. But then, when she was 
around nine, her father left. No good explanation, no caring, he just 
said he was tired of putting up with Hitomi and her mom, and walked 
out on the pair of them. After that, Hitomi stopped playing. The pain 
of her dad leaving her simply hurt her too much. Every time she sat on 
her stool, and placed slender fingers to black and white keys, the 
memory of her dad returned. But after a talk with her mom about it, 
she realized that running away from this would only emulate the 
cowardice of her father, and she didn&#146;t want that. Hitomi wanted to 
know that she was strong enough to look her demons in the eye, and 
stare them down. Hitomi then poured all of her efforts into the piano, 
regarding nearly everything else as second place. Up until now, she 
hadn&#146;t really gotten a chance to extend her wings and play nationally, 
or even regional, but a few weeks ago, in her music class at school, 
Hitomi and the class were told that a musician from Germany, was 
coming to a recital in May, and would be selecting an apprentice would 
spend a month in Germany with him. Hitomi became extremely exited 
about this, and from them, had forsaken most of her social life, and 
concentrated all of her energies into practicing. And as much as 
Hitomi hated to admit it, it was absorbing all of her strength. She 
could see that from her condition, she was well overdue for a 
luxurious, un-winding, carefree break from it all. The platinum blonde 
yawned again, covering her mouth while doing so, and tiredly stepped 
out of her plush, warm, ever-so-inviting bed. The platinum blonde 
gazed a thin gaze at the clock on her nightstand, beside half empty 
glass of orange juice, a musician&#146;s monthly magazine and a jewellery 
box. 
 
&#147;7.16.&#148; 
 
The blonde mumbled to herself, and padded over to the door and into 
the hallway, in the direction of the bathroom. After about fifty 
minutes in the bathroom, taking a particularly relaxing soak in the 
bath, allowing her to undo knots and loosen up muscles, Hitomi walked 
outside in her bath robe, feeling like a million bucks. She may of 
looked and felt like a wreck this morning, but now she was back to 
life, and was prepared for a long day at school. The Musician walked 
into her room, and grabbed her freshly ironed school uniform from the 
hangers over her bed. After drying her hair and quickly put them on, 
Hitomi jetted down the stairs as then sweet scent of her Mom&#146;s early 
morning cooking pervaded her nostrils. Hitomi walked into the kitchen 
and sat down on a chair next to the dining table, staring at the 
mountain of food that lay before her.
 
&#147;Morning Mom.&#148; She said, snagging a piece of toast from one of the 
plates on the dining table.
 
Ms Benisaki smiled at her daughter. &#147;Morning Sweetie.&#148;
 
The older woman sat down at the table, and got comfortable as she took 
a sip of coffee, as she began to read a newspaper.
 
&#147;You know, Hitomi...I&#146;ve been thinking.&#148;
 
Hitomi stopped eating when she heard her mom speak. Her voice seemed 
to suddenly become concerned and worried.
 
&#147;What&#146;s up Mom?&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki put down the newspaper and stared at her daughter, her 
eyes mirroring the worry in her voice.
 
&#147;You&#146;ve been practicing a lot lately. Are you okay?&#148;
 
Hitomi looked confused. 
 
&#147;Sure Mom...why ask?&#148; With a sudden curiosity ringing in her voice to 
confirm as to why her mother asked her such a question.
 
&#147;I just think you need to relax a bit sweetie. Why don&#146;t you go out 
and have some fun with your friends?&#148;
 
The platinum blonde blinked at her equally blonde mother and frowned.
 
&#147;I need to practice Mom. This means a lot to me, and so does the 
apprenticeship in Germany. I thought you knew that.&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki&#146;s face crossed at her daughter, taken aback by her mild 
iciness.
 
&#147;I&#146;m only concerned Hitomi. You seem so tired lately. This constant 
practice and preparation regime you&#146;ve got on is taking its toll on 
you.&#148;  
 
The coldness in Hitomi&#146;s disposition faded now, as she understood her 
mom was only interested in her well-being. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry Mom. I&#146;ll try and relax a bit, yeah?&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki nodded. 
 
&#147;Okay. As long as you&#146;re going to take it easy.&#148;
 
Just as the tension vanished from the room, the two heard the 
doorbell. Hitomi smiled to herself and quickly stood up off of her 
seat, and sipped the cup of tea next to her before she set it down.
 
&#147;That&#146;s probably Tomaru Mom, so I better get going to school.&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki smiled at her daughter. She was surprised that Hitomi 
actually seemed to enjoy school, whereas most people her age could not 
stand school and the maniac who came up with the idea. 
 
&#147;I&#146;ll see you later then, Hitomi.&#148; 
 
Hitomi nodded. &#147;Bye Mom!&#148;
 
The platinum quickly picked up her folder from beside the pine table, 
walked out into the hallway and towards the door, opening it for her 
friend. The two smiled at each other, and walked out into the front.
 
&#147;Morning Tomaru!&#148;  Said Hitomi. 
 
&#147;Morning.&#148; He said in return.
 
The two young students walked out into the street. It was quiet and 
serene, as it usually was in the mornings, and for some reason, Hitomi 
thought that quietness suited the day. Tomaru looked over to his 
friend whom he had know since they were toddlers. Her eagerness to get 
to school always made him smile. Hitomi was the only person he knew 
who actually liked to go to school.
 
&#147;You seem enthusiastic today. What&#146;s up?&#148; Tomaru asked.
 
Hitomi didn&#146;t look at him or answer back, just walked along, gradually 
responding to him, blushing a little.  
 
&#147;No real reason. I just felt lousy this morning and after I took a 
nice bath, I felt right as rain.&#148;
 
Tomaru frowned. He knew what was making Hitomi feel lousy. Tomaru had 
been around when Hitomi&#146;s father walked out on her and her mom, and he 
knew that Hitomi took it hard. The auburn haired boy didn&#146;t know what 
had convinced Hitomi to drop playing the piano, but as soon as she 
started taking it back up, her desire to become better at it stared to 
border on an obsession. 
 
&#147;And you do know why you felt so poorly don&#146;t you?&#148;
 
Hitomi stopped walking and turned herself around to face Tomaru, his 
face obviously trying to mask his apparent sarcasm. 
 
&#147;Is my just wanting to do the best for myself that bad? Why do people 
keep banging on about the amount of time I spend on the piano?&#148;
 
&#147;Well if you say it like that, it makes it seem as if there is no 
problem.&#148;
 
Hitomi frowned. &#147;That&#146;s because there isn&#146;t one.&#148;
 
The Auburn haired boy smiled defiantly at Hitomi. &#147;Can you really lie 
to me Hitomi? I&#146;ve known you since you were half the height you are 
now, and if there is one thing I know, it&#146;s when you lie.&#148;
 
The platinum blonde pouted and turned away from Tomaru, continuing to 
walk along the quiet morning street. 
 
&#147;Sometimes I really hate you Tomaru.&#148; 

Tomaru heard his best friend mumble that and he smiled to himself. 
 
&#147;I just miss you that&#146;s all. I can&#146;t remember that last time we went 
out together.&#148;
 
Hitomi&#146;s face turned downcast. Was she neglecting her friendship with 
Tomaru for the sake of becoming a better pianist?
 
Hitomi faced Tomaru again as the two walked along, and frowned 
apologetically at the auburn haired boy.
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry Tomaru. Have I really been that absorbed in myself?&#148;
 
Tomaru looked up into the sky and held his hand to his chin, in a 
forced attempt to seem as if her were in a very deep sense of 
contemplation.
 
&#147;Well I wouldn&#146;t go as far to say that you&#146;ve become absorbed in 
yourself, but you are distant nowadays.&#148;
 
Hitomi walked close to her best friend and clasped his hand.
 
&#147;You know I&#146;m not doing this on purpose right? This apprenticeship in 
Germany means a lot to me you do know that, don&#146;t you?&#148; 
 
Tomaru smiled, and hugged Hitomi. He missed this, having a little 
argument that would degenerate into them getting closer together.
 
&#147;I know that Hitomi. I just want you to take a break from this to get 
back into the swing of things. You know, spread your wings a bit?&#148;     
 
&#147;I will Tomaru. I&#146;ll take it easy for a little while.&#148;
 
Hitomi pulled out of her friend&#146;s embrace, and the two kept walking 
towards school. About twenty minutes later, the two reached the front 
gates of their massive high school. Dozens of people were hanging 
around out in front of the outer wall, talking amongst themselves 
about what they did on the weekend, or how boring the day of school 
would be. As Tomaru and Hitomi pulled into the school, a group of boys 
that Tomaru knew but Hitomi didn&#146;t, saw the two of them walking into 
together, and started laughing and wolf-whistling. Hitomi just kind of 
ignored it and kept on walking through the steel gates, but Tomaru 
sweat dropped as a blush crept across his face. Although Hitomi was 
his best friend of nearly eight years, he had had a crush on her for a 
good chunk of them. To see Hitomi face to face makes it understandable 
as to why he felt the way he did. She was completely beautiful. Her 
good looks were impossible to walk away from. Those stunning sapphire 
eyes, her gorgeous waterfall of golden blonde hair, her flawless body&#133; 
yes Hitomi Benisaki was incredible, but Tomaru held no illusions about 
the two of them. They were friends and only friends, and always would 
be, that was the way Tomaru saw it and the way Hitomi expected it to 
be. Besides, Tomaru knew (even though she didn&#146;t say anything) that 
her heart belonged to another...

The two walked into the first block of the school, and as they did so, 
the auburn haired boy looked sidelong at his best friend. That person 
Hitomi liked was completely wrong for her, he knew that, and in some 
twisted way Hitomi knew that too, but the platinum blonde didn&#146;t seem 
to care. She was trapped in a hopeless infatuation with that 
person...Tomaru grimaced again at the thought of it, but chose not to 
let Hitomi see it and unnecessarily worry about him.
 
&#147;Hey Hitomi.&#148;
 
The platinum blonde girl looked back at the Auburn haired boy, but 
looked in front of them to realise that they had reached his class. 
 
&#147;This is my exit. I&#146;ll catch you later yeah?&#148; Hitomi instantly became 
worried when she heard Tomaru speak; he seemed disheartened somehow, 
as if something dawned on him. 
 
&#147;You okay? You seem a little bit...sad. Everything all right?&#148; Hitomi 
asked concerned, eliciting a half-hearted smile from the Auburn haired 
boy.
 
&#147;I&#146;m fine Hitomi. I&#146;ll see you at lunch.&#148;
 
Hitomi smiled. &#147;Yep.&#148;
 
The two then parted ways as Tomaru walked into his classroom, to be 
greeted by his friends. As she began to walk away to her own class, 
the Platinum blonde then thought questioningly to herself.
 
{I wonder if he really is okay. I must have something to do with my 
spending so much time practicing. Maybe I do need to cool it a little. 
I don&#146;t want to drift any further apart from Tomaru then I already 
have.} 
 
Hitomi continued to walk down the hall to her own classroom, and 
gently tugged at the door, entered, greeted the friends of hers that 
were there, and quickly sat down. This morning she was really eager to 
get to school, but there was only one real reason for this, and that 
was to see...

Just as Hitomi started thinking about her, Ranka Yanagi and other 
girls walked into the room. Just as Ranka walked into the room, 
gabbing and chatting with her friends about whatnot, the Platinum 
blonde blushed frantically and clammed up, doing her best to distract 
herself from Ranka&#146;s beauty. However the spirits of curiosity, desire 
and attraction forbade her from chicken&#146;s way out, and forced loving 
sapphire eyes to devour the possessor of her heart. Hitomi forced 
herself to look over Ranka. It was impossible to simply describe how 
gorgeous she was. No mere description could do her justice...she was 
simply fantastic. Hitomi adored every inch of Ranka. And her sapphire 
eyes started from below, working their way upwards as they gawked over 
the statuesque marvel before them. From her small, delicate feet 
wrapped in tiny school shoes, her smooth marble finished legs, 
endlessly long, paving the way for tight, thin curvaceous thighs, so 
sweet and feminine, yet at the same time athletic and strong. Her 
delicate, long fingers perched upon her lean waist to her fine upper 
body...beaming its pride, Ranka&#146;s chest...small, firm and shapely 
breasts, with that disturbingly powerful ability to completely 
distract you from whatever you are doing. Hitomi&#146;s eyes then ran up to 
the beauteous Ranka&#146;s face...her cheeks...so smooth and sweet...those 
full, pink lips, flawless creamy white skin, and thick, unhindered 
raven black, shoulder long hair, framing a face that screamed 
faultlessness. But what caught out Hitomi most were her eyes...Ranka&#146;s 
searing amethyst eyes... those paralysing pools which acted as entry 
to her soul...Hitomi could only sit there, helplessly drowning in 
Ranka&#146;s radiant splendour. If the teacher had not called everyone to 
sit down, Hitomi could have sworn she&#146;d spend the rest of the day just 
staring at Ranka. Luckily she sat behind Hitomi, about three seats 
behind and two seats across, and even at that point, Hitomi know 
better than to stare at Ranka from that position. And despite Ranka&#146;s 
good looks, the people she hung around with were utterly conceited and 
self-absorbed. In her heart she felt that Ranka wasn&#146;t completely like 
they were, that she was different somehow but still, they stood in the 
way. The only person who Hitomi had told about her sexuality was 
Tomaru. At first he seemed quite shocked, and for some reason, he was 
disappointed, but after the initial shock of it all, Tomaru accepted 
it and said he would always be her friend no matter what. However 
Hitomi couldn&#146;t see Ranka being half as accepting, knowing her 
orientation, let alone knowing that she was falling in love with her. 
So the Platinum blonde girl did every thing in her power not to let 
anyone else know, especially Ranka, about her feelings. But it was 
difficult. Hitomi could barely spend five minutes around the raven 
haired girl without staring at her, and when she wasn&#146;t around, she 
felt this painful longing in her heart. The only thing that could 
distract her from that longing was the piano and that was one of the 
reasons she was so devoted to mastering it. It was the only thing that 
could prevent her from crying herself to sleep each night, knowing how 
close Ranka is and yet how far she would always be.
 
**********
 
After Hitomi pulled herself out of the trance that Ranka left her in, 
the blonde looked up to see that class was almost over. At that point, 
Hitomi would have screamed for joy, but she then caught sight of the 
blackboard. There were around twelve different pairings for a history 
project, and wouldn&#146;t you know it, at the bottom of the list, in big 
bold letters, stated the final pairing. And Hitomi didn&#146;t know whether 
to laugh in triumph, or scream in frustration...
 
Ranka Yanagi &amp; Hitomi Benisaki
 
At that point, suddenly people started to get into their respective 
partnerships and walk out the door. Hitomi would have done so to, but 
a certain amethyst-eyed girl walked over and spoke to a particularly 
nervous and edgy sapphire eyed one. 
 
&#147;So Hitomi, shall we get started?&#148;
 
**********
 
About 10.35, an hour and a half after Hitomi&#146;s history class, Ranka 
and Hitomi when to the library to research the topic that they were 
working on. Ranka seemed quite keen to get the project started, and 
Hitomi was too, but the Platinum blonde was just couldn&#146;t keep her 
eyes off of the dark haired girl. With her nose behind a particularly 
large history book, Hitomi would every so often peer over it and stare 
at Ranka, thinking sweet thoughts about her, her face reddening more 
and more at the sight of Ranka&#146;s beauty. Normally Hitomi would have 
done a much better job at concealing her feelings, but Ranka had been 
away for a while, out sick with the flu, so this was the first time 
she had seen the Amethyst eyed girl in a couple of weeks. And it 
looked like longing grew with separation, because the desire burning 
in the young woman&#146;s heart was becoming an inferno...Just as Hitomi 
started to stare at Ranka again, something in her head clicked, as she 
realized that Ranka was looking directly back at her. Ranka raised an 
eyebrow at Hitomi, and gently placed delicate fingers on her pale 
face, all the while not taking her eyes off of the musician.
 
&#147;Something on my face?&#148; 
 
Hitomi&#146;s eyes widened considerably, and she laughed out-loud (and 
nervously) as Ranka stared at her questioningly.
 
&#147;U-uh...uh...no, just um, I was wondering if, you had found out 
anything more about the project in the book?&#148; 
 
Hitomi applauded herself in her mind at such a brilliant recovery, 
whereas Ranka just kept on looking at the Platinum blonde.
 
&#147;Why are you so jumpy?&#148; 
 
Hitomi kept on laughing, and could feel her cheeks burn with Ranka&#146;s 
fixed glare. 
 
&#147;I-I&#146;m not...jumpy, I&#146;m just a little...tired at the moment.&#148;
 
Ranka&#146;s glare then softened, and the dark haired girl eased back into 
the chair she was on. She had only known Hitomi for a couple of years 
but through those years, anytime she was around Hitomi the girl seemed 
so nervous and agitated. People always acted like that around Ranka, 
and it made her angry. She wasn&#146;t nearly as vain or as fickle as 
people thought she was, she just she had friends who were much more 
interested in popularity and looks rather than anything else. She was 
part of the &#145;in&#146; crowd, and their superior attitude intimidated a lot 
of the other people in their school. But although her friends didn&#146;t, 
Ranka really liked Hitomi...she was so mature for her age, not like 
the rest of the kids at her school. Hitomi was intelligent and 
innocent, charming and cute...yes she was nursing a crush on the young 
girl, and it wasn&#146;t going anywhere. That was the main reason why she 
didn&#146;t want Hitomi to feel uncomfortable around her. Ranka wanted the 
girl she cared about the most to happy with her. 

Hitomi also seemed to calm down a little, and settled down in her 
chair. The platinum blonde and returned to reading, and she at least 
looked like she was better suited to Ranka. The amethyst-eyed girl 
looked up at the girl and exhaled. 
 
{I do want to get to know Hitomi better, but she always acts like she 
is afraid of me... especially now...it&#146;s like she&#146;s going out of her 
way to avoid me. I like you Hitomi, why can&#146;t I just say it?}
 
Ranka sighed at that thought. That was the thing that hurt the most. 
Knowing someone you care about cannot return that same affection, no 
matter what the circumstances were. Suddenly a strangely appealing 
idea stomped its way though Ranka&#146;s brain, and the dark haired girl 
smiled gently at the idea&#133;
 
&#147;Hey, Hitomi?&#148; 
 
Hitomi didn&#146;t look back up; she just kept looking at the book she was 
supposed to be reading.
 
&#147;...Yeah?&#148; 
 
Ranka swallowed. &#147;After school, can we go to your place to go over 
this?&#148;
 
Hitomi placed her book on the table and looked at Ranka with such 
confusion, she forgot about her erratic blushing. Ranka had never, 
*ever* asked to go to Hitomi&#146;s house before.
 
&#147;Huh...B-but why?&#148;

Ranka kind of shuffled on the chair she was on, and tried not to look 
at Hitomi. When the idea was in her head it seemed to make sense, but 
as soon as she put it out there, it hung in the air like a very bad 
stench.
 
&#147;Well, you said you feel tired, you might be a little more relaxed if 
you were at home, and it is really stuffy in this library and I&#146;ve 
never seen your house, so why not?&#148;
 
Ranka gave Hitomi fairly valid reasons, but it still did not make her 
feel anymore comfortable about it. It was hard enough to be around her 
at school but at her house?
 
{Maybe I should say no&#133; but that would be mean, wouldn&#146;t it? It&#146;s not 
her fault I feel this way about her. But I seriously don&#146;t feel like 
entertaining Ranka all night. I have to say no.}
 
&#147;Alright.&#148;

{Good god I&#146;m an idiot.}
 
**********
 
After school, about 4.26, Ranka and Hitomi left their last class; and 
began to walk to the front gates. At first glance the two seemed to be 
perfectly normal, but both of them were secretly quite nervous. Hitomi 
was worried that if she spent too much time with Ranka, the other girl 
might catch on to her feelings for her, and then Ranka wouldn&#146;t want 
to be near her at all...But Ranka herself was looking forward to 
having some time to herself with Hitomi. She knew that if she could 
just get Hitomi to see how she was outside of school, then she might 
have had a chance at making Hitomi like her. They weren&#146;t exactly 
friends as it is, and she knew that a great deal of guys were willing 
to ask her out, but were just a little bit browbeaten by her very 
committed work ethic. 

At the gates, Hitomi smiled as she saw Tomaru, and ran over to him. 
Ranka was a little thrown by her eagerness to meet the Auburn haired 
boy, and just looked at the two of them. Tomaru was equally thrown by 
the fact that he saw Hitomi and Ranka together. He knew about Hitomi&#146;s 
feelings for her, but he only saw Ranka as everyone else saw her, 
vain, conceited and immature. Tomaru wanted the best for Hitomi, and 
Ranka wasn&#146;t it. Hitomi walked up to her best friend and smiled.
 
&#147;Hi Tomaru!&#148;
 
&#147;Hiya.&#148; He quickly responded, keeping a fixed stare on the girl just 
behind Hitomi, who was giving him an equally vicious stare. Hitomi 
really didn&#146;t seem able to see the tension between Tomaru and Ranka. 
For someone so smart, she did have her fair share of &#145;blonde&#146; days. 
 
&#147;So, Ranka and me are going to work on a history project we were 
assigned today at my house, do you want to come along?&#148;
 
Hitomi&#146;s voice was full of a very persuasive need. If she had to have 
Ranka at her house at least she would have the support of Tomaru. 
Ranka&#146;s face frowned when Hitomi invited Tomaru, she generally would 
have had no problem with it, but the amethyst-eyed girl wanted to be 
alone with Hitomi. Tomaru could sense this, and chose not to get in 
the way. Although he didn&#146;t like Ranka, that didn&#146;t give him a right 
to prevent the two from getting closer to each other.
 
&#147;Nah, that&#146;s okay. I&#146;ve got some stuff to sort out at home.&#148;

Hitomi acted mock angrily. &#147;Well, look who was talking to me about not 
having much time to spend anymore this morning!&#148;
 
Tomaru smiled. &#147;So sorry mademoiselle, but we don&#146;t always have time, 
now do we!&#148; Tomaru then walked though the gate, quickly looking back 
before turning a corner. &#147;I&#146;ll catch you later.&#148;
 
&#147;See you Tomaru!&#148; Hitomi looked back at Ranka. &#147;Ready?&#148;
 
Ranka looked around in the direction Tomaru left and nodded. About 
fifteen minutes after they left school and walked towards Hitomi&#146;s 
house, Ranka became suddenly curious about Hitomi&#146;s relationship with 
Tomaru. It wasn&#146;t that she felt threatened by him, but they did act 
like a couple, rather than just best friends. 
 
&#147;Hitomi?&#148;
 
When the platinum blonde heard Ranka&#146;s beautiful voice, she turned her 
head gently to look at her, Hitomi&#146;s cheeks once again burning at the 
sight of Ranka. 
 
&#147;Um...y-yeah?&#148; Hitomi said, paying attention to Ranka, not her own 
voice.
 
&#147;Are you and Tomaru...more than friends?&#148;
 
Hitomi&#146;s eyes widened in surprise to Ranka&#146;s question, and the blush 
she was carrying doubled in its brightness, but for a different reason 
then Ranka.
 
&#147;W-where...where did that come from?&#148; Hitomi blurted out. 
 
Ranka looked down to the ground. It suddenly seemed more inviting.
 
&#147;I was just wondering, I mean...you two seem...close, you know? It&#146;s 
none of my business or anything, but it seemed like...&#148;
 
Hitomi smirked and looked forward, in front of her. 
 
&#147;Tomaru and I are just really close friends. I&#146;ve known him since we 
were little kids, and we always look out for each other. That&#146;s all.&#148;
 
&#147;Oh.&#148; Ranka was a lot happier about that then she let on...
 
**********
 
A bit later on, the two reached Hitomi&#146;s house. After Ranka asked 
Hitomi about Tomaru, the mood between them seemed to lighten. They to 
each other spoke casually and felt a little ease settle between them. 
Whilst the two reached the front door, Hitomi pulled out her key and 
went inside. Ranka followed her, placing her folder just beside the 
phone on the coffee table in the hallway. She took a second to look 
over the blonde&#146;s home. She had never expected it to look like this. 
It was so warm and accommodating. Not like her own home. Her house was 
so cold in a sense. Ranka didn&#146;t feel at home there. She just couldn&#146;t 
help but wonder if Hitomi helped to decorate it. 

The platinum blonde looked around and called for her mom, but no one 
answered back. Hitomi then walked into the kitchen, and grabbed a note 
from the message board, while Ranka walked into the kitchen also, to 
she what she was doing.
 
&#147;Anything wrong?&#148; she asked quietly.
 
Hitomi blushed again, and she screwed up the note in her hand.
 
&#147;Uh, yeah. My Mom just left a note saying that she wont be home until 
really late tonight, it&#146;s got something to do with some kind of hold 
up at the hospital or something.&#148; 
 
&#147;Your Mom&#146;s a doctor right?&#148; 
 
Hitomi nodded. She didn&#146;t get much chance to see her mom during the 
weekdays, since her work got in the way. Not that it mattered much; 
Hitomi was always too caught up in practicing for any recitals.
 
&#147;Anyway, you&#146;re a guest here, make yourself comfortable.&#148;
 
In a fit of over-enthusiasm, Hitomi clutched Ranka&#146;s hand and led her 
to the living room. Ranka was initially surprised about that, but 
didn&#146;t say anything, and just let Hitomi lead her to the Living room. 
And even though it only lasted a few seconds, Hitomi&#146;s heart soared as 
flesh pressed against flesh...
 
{Her hands&#133; they&#146;re so soft...}
 
And surprisingly enough, Ranka thoughts were very much the same.   
 
**********
 
Later on, the two worked on the project for their history class. 
Surprisingly, Hitomi managed to keep her cool around Ranka, and 
controlled her constant blushing. Ranka also felt a bit better, as 
Hitomi started to open up to her a bit. But if it took time, Ranka 
wouldn&#146;t be confused about it. She knew much as anyone that she had a 
reputation for being stuck-up. The amethyst-eyed girl hoped that 
Hitomi could see past that though, obviously Tomaru couldn&#146;t... After 
a while, Ranka could see that Hitomi was distracted by something, 
because she kept turning to look back at her piano for some reason.
 
Ranka suddenly got the feeling, that Hitomi would rather do something 
else. &#147;Hey Hitomi.&#148;
 
&#147;Yeah?&#148; Hitomi looked back at Ranka. She was anxious to practice, but 
with Ranka here...
 
&#147;Do you play the piano?&#148;
 
When Ranka asked her that, Hitomi cast the dark haired girl a very 
confused glare, she felt like she had beet asked the stupidest 
question it the world, but her confusion transformed into realisation 
as she remembered that they really didn&#146;t know that much about each 
other. The platinum blonde lowered her head and blushed again.
 
&#147;Yeah.&#148;
 
Ranka sounded a little sad. &#147;Do you want to it play now?&#148; 
 
&#147;Kinda. You see I have this thing I&#146;m practicing for and need as much 
time as I can get...&#148; Hitomi then looked surprised for a second.
 
&#147;Do you want me to play for you?&#148;  
 
Ranka smiled. &#147;Well I wouldn&#146;t mind.&#148;
{At least that way I don&#146;t have to leave.}
 
Hitomi stood up and walked over to the piano. This felt weird for some 
reason. Not the fact that she was going to play, but the fact that she 
was going to play for Ranka. She didn&#146;t mind it, but for some reason 
the platinum blonde felt nervousness settle down on her shoulders. She 
did not really have a reason to be fearful though. Giving the piano to 
Hitomi was like giving the electric violin to Vanessa Mae. The 
musician quickly sat down on the polished chair by the Steinway piano, 
and cracked her knuckles. Ranka stood on the other side of it; laying 
her elbows on the table and letting her head, rest on her palms.   

Hitomi was just about to play with the note script she had rested on 
the piano, but took a look at it, and pushed it to one side, her face 
scowling a bit. Ranka saw that and became curious.
 
&#147;What&#146;s that?&#148; she asked.
 
Hitomi looked up confusedly. &#147;What was what?&#148;
 
&#147;What&#146;s that piece you were just about play?&#148;
 
{Something I invented to pay homage to you Ranka...}
&#147;Just something I put together...it&#146;s not finished yet though.&#148;
 
Ranka&#146;s curiosity reached its peak. &#147;What&#146;s it called?&#148;
 
Hitomi looked away sadly. &#147;...Requiem of the Heart.&#148;
 
&#147;Requiem of the heart? Seems a little grim, in a cute way. Why name it 
that?&#148;
 
{If you knew how I felt about you then it would make sense.}
&#147;I don&#146;t really know.&#148;
 
Ranka thought for a second. &#147;...Can you play it for me?&#148;
 
The Platinum blonde looked up again. &#147;Huh? But why?&#148;
 
Ranka sweat dropped at the situation. Was she pushing her luck?
 
&#147;I&#133; just want to listen to it...if that&#146;s okay with you that is...I 
mean you don&#146;t have to if you don&#146;t want to...&#148;
 
&#147;No, no it&#146;s okay.&#148;
 
Hitomi cracked her knuckles again, and elegantly placed slender 
fingers artistically on black and white keys. She seemed to wait for a 
second, as if to collect herself in preparation for a wave of rhythm, 
and firmly began playing. From Ranka&#146;s perspective it was a sight to 
behold. As Hitomi played, a harmonious mantra flowed from her actions. 
Ranka took a second to listen to the tune that was being played...it 
felt empty somehow. She knew it was built by pain. She could see that 
from the look on Hitomi&#146;s face, and yet it was still so very 
captivating. Just like Hitomi looked while playing it. Ranka sighed 
breathlessly as she watched Hitomi continue manipulate the canvas, 
which was her piano...This was the best time to gaze at the Platinum 
blonde; she was completely oblivious to everything around her while 
she played and it was just as well, because Ranka couldn&#146;t stop 
smiling at the musician. 
 
{She looks so deep when she plays. Just like I thought she would. I 
wish this could go on forever...} 
 
Suddenly, just as Ranka began to lose herself in Hitomi&#146;s depth, the 
blonde musician stopped playing, dragging Ranka out of her reverie. 
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong? Why did you stop playing?&#148; Ranka sounded almost sad&#133;
 
Hitomi smiled sadly. &#147;I told you. I haven&#146;t finished it.&#148;
 
&#147;Why don&#146;t you finish it...it&#146;s beautiful...&#148;
 
Hitomi frowned at Ranka. She obviously didn&#146;t understand the 
situation. At least not enough to see how it made her feel...
 
&#147;I don&#146;t like playing it because it reminds me too much of what I 
don&#146;t have, and that hurts me.&#148;
 
&#147;But...&#148; Ranka didn&#146;t get a chance to finish her sentence, as Hitomi 
quickly stood and glared angrily at her.
 
&#147;I said I don&#146;t like playing it now can we leave it at that?&#148; 
 
Ranka blinked furiously and looked away from Hitomi. She didn&#146;t expect 
to be yelled at. She just liked it, that&#146;s all...Hitomi instantly 
regretted reacting so harshly to Ranka when she saw the hurt look on 
her face. It was not her fault that Hitomi...
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry, I didn&#146;t mean to upset you, Hitomi.&#148; Ranka said. 
 
Hitomi walked over to Ranka and laid her hands on her shoulders 
reassuringly. The blonde musician would have blushed again at her 
forthright attitude if it weren&#146;t for the sad look on Ranka&#146;s elegant 
face. 
 
&#147;No I should apologize, I shouldn&#146;t have yelled at you. I&#146;m sorry I 
didn&#146;t mean it. Hey, how about me playing something else for you?&#148;
 
Ranka looked across to Hitomi and smiled a bit, letting go of the 
previous shock.
 
&#147;Okay.&#148;
 
Hitomi beamed a wide grin at Ranka and sat down on the chair again, 
starting to play another piece. Ranka leaned down on the piano again 
and watched the musician return to her trance like state as played.
 
{I really don&#146;t know a lot about her do I?}
 
*********
 
About 2 months after that, Hitomi and Ranka started to become much 
closer. It went exactly as Ranka planned it. The two spent some time 
together, Hitomi would see a different side from her, and the two of 
them would grow closer. And Ranka loved it. Hitomi had stopped acting 
so nervous and anxious all the time, allowing Ranka to get talk to her 
a lot more. They suddenly started to learn things about the other and 
were happy that their relationship was improving. However when it came 
to the feelings they shared for one and other, the two girls tread 
carefully. Ranka wasn&#146;t nearly as bottled up as Hitomi was and knew 
that even if Hitomi didn&#146;t feel the same way, she could confide her 
and not expect to be penalized for it. Ranka was only waiting for the 
right time to act. However Hitomi could not be as sure about Ranka as 
Ranka was about her. It wasn&#146;t that she didn&#146;t trust Ranka; she knew 
the dark haired girl was not as stuck-up or as vain as people at 
school said she was. But the people she called her friends *were* that 
way, and the fear of Ranka being publicly hated forced her to keep 
quiet. Despite that resolve, the actual execution of it was extremely 
hard; Because of Ranka&#146;s innocent seductiveness&#133;
 
**********
 
&#147;How &#145;bout this one?&#148;
 
&#147;It&#146;s...n-nice...&#148;
 
Ranka and Hitomi were at Ranka&#146;s house; today they planned on going to 
the mall to do a little shopping. However, Ranka could not decide what 
to wear, so requested Hitomi&#146;s help. And for some reason, she seemed 
oblivious to the effects standing there in nothing but her underwear 
was having on the blonde musician...
 
Ranka had held up a black tank top to her chest, and just looked at 
Hitomi expectantly, trying to elicit some form of reaction from her, 
which would confirm which one looked best on her. All Hitomi could do 
was blush maddeningly, desperately trying to control herself but she 
couldn&#146;t...Ranka walked over to her wardrobe and stretched up to try 
and reach a pile of clothes on the upper inside shelf. And Hitomi&#146;s 
jaw dropped as the beauty just before her stood on her tiptoes to 
achieve her goal. Hitomi couldn&#146;t stand it anymore. She turned away 
before Ranka&#146;s body trapped her gaze again. How could God allow anyone 
to be so attractive? Hitomi was so thrown by her Ranka&#146;s looks that 
she didn&#146;t realize how much this turned her on...
 
{I don&#146;t know how much longer I can keep this up...I can feel the 
blood rushing to my cheeks, god, I wish I could control my blush; it 
will give me away one of these days...but I can&#146;t stop it. I want 
Ranka so bad...} Hitomi thought.
 
The young musician crossed her legs and clutched her fists into tight 
balls, gently gripping the spread of the bed that she was sitting on. 
Ranka grabbed two of the shirts that were on the inside shelf of the 
wardrobe. The dark haired girl presented them to Hitomi and waited for 
her approval. Hitomi stood abruptly, picked out the shirt on the left, 
and quickly left the room. The blonde musician lay back on the wall 
and exhaled. She felt much more comfortable now that she was out of 
there. A few minutes later Ranka walked out of her bedroom wearing the 
shirt that Hitomi had chosen for her and looked around for the 
Platinum blonde. She was leaning on the bathroom door. 
 
Ranka walked up to her with a very confused look across her features.
 
&#147;What&#146;s with you today?&#148;
 
Hitomi giggled uneasily. &#147;W-what are you talking about?&#148;
 
&#147;Well, your red as a tomato for starters, you&#146;re acting jumpy again 
and you&#146;re shaking for some reason...&#148;
 
&#147;I...uhr...well...&#148;

{Come on brain! Think up an excuse for this!}

&#147;Aren&#146;t we supposed to be going to the mall?&#148; 
 
**********
 
About 2.30, later on that day, Hitomi and Ranka went downtown to go to 
the mall. This was the usual routine for them, as they often went 
there after school, but today was different. Today was Saturday, and 
they had some money on them. Well at least Hitomi had some money and 
Ranka just borrowed some of it. Anyway, the two went to the mall as 
planned and enjoyed themselves. Ranka needed this time though. It made 
her happy to be with someone who felt real, and wasn&#146;t so hung up on 
status and looks. The dark haired girl knew she was falling in 
love...she could feel it in her heart every time she looked at Hitomi.  

Ranka turned to look at the musician as they walked into a clothing 
store, and a faint blush beamed across her face.
 
{I&#146;ve got to tell her soon...I need to know how she feels about me...} 
Ranka thought.
 
The duo looked around the clothes shop and bought some things. After 
much persuasion, Hitomi managed to drag Ranka out of there, so they 
could move on to other stores. The dark haired girl had this strange 
habit of wasting her money on the first nice thing she saw. The two 
pulled out and after an eager suggestion from Ranka, the girls went up 
to the upper floor as continued to shop. As Ranka and Hitomi past a 
jewellery store, Ranka caught sight of something that immediately 
ensnared her attention. Hitomi looked back when she realized that 
Ranka had stopped walking, and saw the dark haired girl looking at the 
jewellery. 
 
&#147;What are you looking at?&#148; Hitomi asked as she stood behind Ranka. 
Ranka looked back, frowned and pointed out a ring in the far corner. 
It was sterling silver, engraved with the picture of a Chinese dragon 
around its bottom, with a large sapphire stone over its crest. Hitomi 
then winced when she saw the price.
 
&#147;That&#146;s the ring you want?&#148;
 
Ranka looked at it again and smiled unhappily. 
 
&#147;Yeah. It reminds me a lot of the ring my grandmother had, when I was 
a kid. I always wanted it then too, and when my grandmother gave it to 
me, I was the happiest kid alive. But then I lost it. That ring meant 
a great deal to my grandmother and I felt that I let her down. By 
buying that ring...I dunno. I guess it just makes me feel like I&#146;ve 
made it up to her.&#148; 
 
Hitomi smiled when she heard that. Not that the situation, but at the 
fact that her theory was proven right. Ranka wasn&#146;t shallow at all. 
 
&#147;So that&#146;s why you want the ring. But you feel bad because it&#146;s costs 
more than a small country?&#148;
 
Ranka exhaled. &#147;You hit the nail on the head. There&#146;s no way I can 
afford it. Ah, forget it. Lets go Hitomi.&#148;
 
Ranka held Hitomi&#146;s hand gently and walked away from the store. But 
Hitomi could help but throw glances at that ring.
 
**********
 
After another four hours of shopping and then grabbing a bite to eat, 
Hitomi and Ranka left the mall. They decided to go back to Hitomi&#146;s 
house since that was closer, and Ranka would spend the night there. 
Anyway the two reached Hitomi&#146;s house later on, and quickly went 
upstairs. Ms Benisaki wasn&#146;t there but she would be soon. As soon as 
they got to Hitomi&#146;s room, Ranka dropped her many bags on the floor 
and crashed on the bed, whereas Hitomi looked back to the door.
 
&#147;I just need to go to the bathroom a minute. You okay here?&#148;
 
Ranka nodded. &#147;Yeah, yeah sure.&#148; Hitomi then walked out.
 
The dark haired girl sighed, and lay back on Hitomi&#146;s bed. Two months 
ago she would have been lucky to able to speak to Hitomi, now she was 
coming home from a wonderful day with her. Whilst squirming around on 
the bed, Ranka felt something sticking into her back. The dark haired 
girl sat upright and put her hand under the covers of her bed to fish 
it out. It was a small book, with a velvet bookmark about one third of 
it&#146;s way through the book. On the cover in was entitled in only, 
&#145;Hitomi&#146;s diary&#146;. Then Ranka&#146;s amethyst eyes widened significantly and 
she stared blankly at the small pink book before her. Suddenly Ranka 
was torn by a moral dilemma. She could read this, and see Hitomi&#146;s 
personal ideas, troubles and thoughts. But on the other hand, that 
would betray Hitomi&#146;s trust. Trust that she had worked so hard to get 
from the musician. After a second of indecision, Ranka chose the 
latter. She would feel completely guilty if she did read it.

The dark haired girl tossed the book aside, and cursed as it hit a 
wall and opened up. She didn&#146;t mean to pry, she really didn&#146;t, but as 
the book opened, she automatically looked at the pages that were open. 
She would have looked away completely, but she was forced into 
continuing to read after she saw whom Hitomi was writing about...
 
Ranka un-consciously began to read the passage in the diary out loud.
 
&#147;Sunday 12th. Today I spend the day at my darling Ranka&#146;s house. She 
was so sweet. It&#146;s getting harder and harder to be around her. I don&#146;t 
think she knows how desirable she is. I really need to tell her how I 
feel...I love her so much, but I can&#146;t even bring myself to do so and 
that hurts me so much...&#148;
 
Ranka didn&#146;t realize it but her heart skipped beats as she read 
Hitomi&#146;s diary. She was too shocked to notice how shallow her breath 
was, or the alarmingly bright shades of red on her face...
 
The dark haired girl lowered the book and let what was in it sink into 
her brain...
 
{She loves me...} Ranka&#146;s eyes glazed over as a loving smile crossed 
her face... {She loves me!)  
 
&#147;Hey Ranka...&#148; The dark haired girl panicked as Hitomi walked back 
into the room. Her sleek arm slyly placed Hitomi&#146;s dairy behind her 
back, and she put on the brightest smile she could to stop it from 
seeming like there was a problem. Hitomi looked at her confusedly, 
because Ranka was sitting across from her looking like a kid that had 
just broken a rare and expensive vase. 
 
Hitomi&#146;s eyebrow rose. &#147;Something wrong?&#148; 
 
&#147;N-no, no, not at all...c-could you get me something to drink?&#148;
 
&#147;What would you like?&#148; 
 
Ranka tensed up. &#147;Anything, just...a drink okay?&#148;
 
&#147;Sure.&#148; Hitomi threw Ranka another confused look, and walked 
downstairs. Ranka exhaled in her luck and put Hitomi&#146;s diary back 
under the bed covers where she found it. This was all so overwhelming 
to the dark haired girl. 
 
&#147;She&#146;s in love with me? Is this true? Or was this some kind of 
wind-up? It does seem kind of strange that she would leave her diary 
lying around like that. But maybe she does love me... I just don&#146;t 
understand how I could not have noticed this. She means the world to 
me and all this time she felt the same way...this can&#146;t be real...can 
it? Oh gosh, I&#146;m so confused about this. But maybe she really does 
love me, I mean when she was helping me pick out something to wear, 
she did act a bit weirdly. I just thought she was a little embarrassed 
to be in the same room as me when I was changing, but maybe she wasn&#146;t 
embarrassed about that. Maybe she was...I dunno... attracted to me? 
She did write that I didn&#146;t know how desirable I was. And I do catch 
her staring at me sometimes, mostly because I&#146;m doing the same thing. 
Can it be...she does...she really does love me! I have to see her and 
tell her how I feel about her!&#148;
 
On that note, Ranka ran towards the door with every intention of 
confessing her love to a certain blonde musician, but stopped in her 
tracks as her hand reached the doorknob.
 
&#147;On the other hand...&#148;
 
Ranka sat back down and grinned a fiendish grin as an idea popped into 
her brain...  

At that point, Hitomi walked in, carrying two glasses with her. Ranka 
just smiled sneakily, and crossed her legs on the bed.
 
&#147;I didn&#146;t know what to get you so I just got you the same thing as me, 
a lemonade. Is that okay?&#148;
 
Ranka smiled innocently. &#147;That&#146;s more then okay Hitomi...&#148; 
 
The musician cast a strange look at Ranka, but dismissed it and sat on 
the bed, about three peoples distance from Ranka. The dark haired girl 
put a hurt look on her face, and made a noise that resembled a cross 
between a whimper and a sigh, and shifted closer to the blonde. So 
close in fact that Ranka could smell the sweet scent of Hitomi&#146;s hair. 
Roses. Hitomi became suddenly aware of the closeness between her and 
Ranka, and all the blonde&#146;s internal clocks were set off when the dark 
haired girl laid her head on her smooth shoulder. The musician looked 
down at the girl next to her. Ranka seemed somehow different, like she 
knew something...Hitomi would have preferred it if she stayed where 
she was, after all, you don&#146;t get a great deal of chances to be this 
close to one of the (if not the) cutest girls in school, but she was 
too confused to enjoy it. 
 
&#147;...Uh...do you want to watch some TV?&#148; Hitomi said nervously.
 
Ranka grinned to herself. &#147;Nah. Can we just stay here?&#148;
 
Hitomi&#146;s blush made a roaring return. &#147;Oh...um...okay...&#148; Hitomi 
needed a distraction. She couldn&#146;t stay like this forever...then the 
blonde looked over to the table across from her.
 
&#147;R-ranka, didn&#146;t you w-want to drink that lemonade?&#148; Ranka had now 
closed her eyes and snuggled up closer to Hitomi. She quickly looked 
over to the table with her drink and frowned.
 
&#147;Suddenly I don&#146;t feel very thirsty. Well at least not in that sense. 
I found something else I really want and I&#146;m gonna get it...&#148;
 
Hitomi blushed. For some reason she got the feeling Ranka was talking 
about a little more then ice cold beverages. Ranka sighed as she 
shifted her head along Hitomi&#146;s shoulder. Pulling the other girls left 
hand to her right, one single finger traced out patterns in Hitomi&#146;s 
now shaking palm. 
 
&#147;...And I what I want is...&#148;
 
Before Ranka could finish her sentence, the doorbell rang. Her head 
instantly jerked up and she scowled, irritated. Hitomi kept her face 
neutral, but silently thanked whoever it was who was at the door. If 
she hadn&#146;t of gotten out of there when she did, she would have pinned 
Ranka down onto her bed and...well no need to get into that... Hitomi 
quickly went down stairs and opened the front door to she who it was. 
It was an insurance salesman.
 
{Man, this is the first time I&#146;ve actually appreciated a visit from an 
insurance salesman.}
 
&#147;Hey there young lady, say are your mom and dad home?&#148;
 
&#147;My mom&#146;s out but she&#146;ll be back at about 9.00.&#148; She replied. 
 
&#147;Well thanks girl, I&#146;ll be back at 9.00!&#148; The salesman then left and 
moved onto the next house. Hitomi closed the door, leaning back on it 
and taking a deep breath after she returned to the task at hand.
 
{Whoa. This is a little weird. Why is Ranka all over me? If she were a 
guy I&#146;d think&#133; that she was trying to...flirt with me or 
something...but no...that&#146;s just wishful thinking&#133;}
 
Hitomi was about to walk back upstairs but she stopped on the first 
step, and turned to look into the living room, where Ranka was, spread 
out across her couch. Hitomi slowly walked into the room, and took her 
eyes of Ranka long enough to see how low the lights were.

Ranka smiled innocently again, and patted the place on the couch next 
to her, motioning Hitomi to sit down. The nervous blonde did so, and 
Ranka&#146;s arm snaked up to the top of the couch, lightly resting behind 
Hitomi&#146;s head. The dark haired girl smiled timidly, and leaned in 
towards the blonde musician, mere inches away from her face, close 
enough to observe the crimson flames across it&#133;
 
&#147;Hey Hitomi, how come you don&#146;t have a boyfriend?&#148; Ranka asked.
 
Hitomi looked up at Ranka. She didn&#146;t expect her to say that at all. 
 
Hitomi thought for a second. &#147;I always assumed it was because of my 
intellect. Men seem to be intimidated by me, so keep their distance. 
That&#146;s why I haven&#146;t had any boyfriends. At least that&#146;s how I see 
it.&#148; 
 
Ranka&#146;s arm fell by Hitomi&#146;s shoulder, but the blonde didn&#146;t seem to 
notice, as she continued on.
 
&#147;Either that or they don&#146;t find me very attractive&#133;&#148; The dark-haired 
girl frowned. With her free arm, Ranka gently brushed Hitomi&#146;s bangs 
out of her face, and let her hand slide down to her cheek.
 
&#147;That&#146;s not true. Those guys were fools Hitomi.&#148; Ranka&#146;s thumb then 
rubbed Hitomi&#146;s soft cheek, and she smiled lovingly at her. 

&#147;I think you&#146;re very beautiful&#133;&#148;
 
Hitomi looked at her feet, to draw attention from her face. &#147;Ranka...&#148;
 
The dark-haired girl in question moved closer to the blonde girl, let 
the hand on Hitomi&#146;s cheek slide under her jaw, and passionately drew 
Hitomi&#146;s face to her own.
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; The dark-haired whispered.
 
The musician squirmed on the couch, and leaned back as Ranka moved 
forwards. 
 
&#147;I don&#146;t...I don&#146;t know...&#148; Hitomi looked at Ranka, with an almost 
pleading look in her eyes. It was taking *all* of the blonde&#146;s 
restraint to prevent herself from kissing the dark haired girl. 

Ranka moved in even closer to Hitomi, and the musician had to lean 
back on the armrest of the couch, but that didn&#146;t faze her. Ranka 
moved her whole body into the couch, supporting herself by grabbing 
the armrest that Hitomi&#146;s head was lying on, lifting her right leg 
over Hitomi&#146;s thighs, and straddling them. As she got comfortable in 
her new position, she clutched Hitomi&#146;s face in both of her palms and 
lowered herself even closer to the blonde, so close that she could 
feel her shallow, quick and warm breaths on her face... 

The dark haired girl gazed into sapphire pools...drowning in their 
innocence and maturity...after 2 and 1/2 years of watching this girl 
from a distance: Ranka finally had Hitomi at her mercy... 
 
Ranka gasped out, not realizing she was holding her breath, and 
lowered her lips towards Hitomi&#146;s...
 
&#147;I told you Hitomi Benisaki. I always get whatever it is that I 
want...and what I want is you.&#148;
 
Ranka said nothing more as she gently seized Hitomi&#146;s soft pink lips 
for her own, clutching at Hitomi&#146;s head and running her long fingers 
through the blonde&#146; endless waterfall of angelic hair. Hitomi only 
gasped under her breath, eyes wide open and completely baffled by 
Ranka&#146;s affections. But a long-built and wall maintained desire took 
centre stage, and Hitomi wrapped her arms around Ranka, opening her 
mouth to deepen the kiss. They went on like that for the next half 
hour. They didn&#146;t bother to explain their feelings towards each other, 
for some reason the two didn&#146;t think that they really needed to. The 
only thing that seemed to matter to them at this point, was the fact 
that they were now in each others arms...
 
**********
 
&#147;I wish you told me how you felt Hitomi.&#148;
 
Hitomi and Ranka were outside at a park, just a few streets away from 
Hitomi&#146;s place. They were sitting on a bench just below a cherry 
blossom tree, huddled up together, holding hands. Hitomi looked at 
Ranka and smiled lovingly.
 
&#147;How could I? We&#146;ve never been really close have we? It&#146;s only since 
the past two months that we have gotten closer. And that was hard to 
believe too. I just didn&#146;t want to jeopardize that Ranka.&#148;
 
Ranka&#146;s face grew concerned at Hitomi&#146;s confession.
 
&#147;Didn&#146;t you think you could trust me?&#148;
 
Hitomi also grew concerned at the amount of pain she heard in Ranka&#146;s 
voice when she said that. Hitomi leaned across, pulling herself close 
to Ranka and gently cupped her cheek, looking deeply into her eyes.
 
&#147;Of course I trust you Ranka. It&#146;s just that you don&#146;t really think 
that about someone do you? And your friends aren&#146;t really accepting of 
me are they? Let alone the idea of me being in love with you. I don&#146;t 
want to make things hard for you.&#148;
 
Ranka face brightened a bit. &#147;You could never Hitomi. I love you.&#148;
 
Hitomi smiled, and was about to say it back; but Ranka hungrily 
pressed her lips up against Hitomi&#146;s. Ranka would have normally 
checked to see if anyone was around before she did that, but at this 
point it really didn&#146;t seem to matter to her. All she cared about now, 
was Hitomi.
 
**********
 
After that day the two of them became much, much closer. At first 
people started to raise eyebrows at the way they were around each 
other. They never said anything that gave them away, but it was the 
way that the two of them would meet, and then disappear for about 
fifteen minutes, coming back all flustered, if they were in a 
conversation that had nothing to do with Hitomi or Ranka, and then 
someone brought one of them up, the other would get all dreamy and 
spaced out. The way they acted around each other wasn&#146;t going 
unnoticed either. Tomaru had actually caught them making out at one 
point, though he long suspected that something was going on. He knew 
that Hitomi had feelings for Ranka (and her sexuality), so it didn&#146;t 
shock him that the musician was in love with her, but he still could 
not understand why she fell for *Ranka*. He still disliked Ranka, and 
Ranka disliked him, but the two put up with each other for Hitomi&#146;s 
sake. 

Three months after they admitted their love for each other, Ranka&#146;s 
birthday had come up. Ranka&#146;s friends had organized a party for her on 
that day. Ranka really wanted Hitomi to come, to the point at which 
she said that she would call the whole thing off if Hitomi didn&#146;t. The 
platinum blonde told her to calm down, and said that she would come, 
but only to drop off Ranka&#146;s present. Ranka grudgingly accepted that, 
and today was the day. Hitomi was now at home, wrapping Ranka&#146;s gift, 
and was about to leave.
 
{Please let her like it.} Hitomi thought.
 
After putting the finishing touches to the wrapping, Hitomi put it in 
a bag and stood upright off of her bed, stretching a bit. The blonde 
musician walked out her door, and down the stairs. Just as she was 
about to walk to her door, Hitomi&#146;s Steinway piano stole a glance from 
her. Ever since she had started seeing Ranka, her time for the piano 
was limited. Ranka said she preferred it that way, as Hitomi spent way 
too much time practicing with it. But Hitomi wasn&#146;t so sure about 
that. Although she felt she had the skill and the potential no matter 
what happened, the big one was coming up in a few weeks. The time with 
Ranka had prevented her from doing any serious practicing for the past 
five days, and the worry about blowing her one big chance was getting 
to her. But at this point, what mattered to her most was Ranka. Hitomi 
turned away from the piano and left through the front door. Half an 
hour later, Hitomi reached Ranka&#146;s house. Ranka&#146;s house was gigantic, 
with about five large main bedrooms and two guest bedrooms. Although 
Ranka did try her best to make Hitomi feel more comfortable there, her 
house just seemed so cold and barren. But today, the house now just 
seemed to be alive. It was bursting with people and music, and for 
some reason, it seemed fresh and invigorating to be around the party. 
Hitomi considered staying, but the fact that a lot of Ranka&#146;s popular 
friends were here, cast the idea out of her mind. Hitomi didn&#146;t like 
them and they didn&#146;t like Hitomi, but the platinum blonde made the 
effort to avoid them, rather than inadvertently drive a wedge between 
them and Ranka. 

Hitomi stepped up the small amount of steps leading to Ranka&#146;s home, 
and knocked loudly on the door. She doubted somebody would hear it if 
she knocked any less due to the loud level of the music, but 
eventually she was heard. One of her friends from school opened the 
door and greeted Hitomi. Hitomi was instantly surprised by the amount 
of people that were here. Ranka said that the party would be big but 
she had no idea that this many people would be attending it. Ranka&#146;s 
place now seemed more like a dance hall then a house. Hitomi looked 
around for her girlfriend but saw no one who looked liked her.
 
Hitomi turned to the guy that let her inside. &#147;Where&#146;s Ranka?&#148;
 
&#147;She should be over there, in the far kitchen.&#148; Hitomi raised an 
eyebrow at that, but the boy just shrugged it off and walked away. 
Hitomi then walked through the masses of people in her way, and walked 
through the hall, past the many rooms and reached the far kitchen. 
Hitomi walked in, and looked around to see Ranka by the window, 
staring out of it, looking somewhat wistful. 
 
Ranka let out a melancholy sigh and whispered to herself, not 
realizing that Hitomi was at the doorway.
 
&#147;Where are you Hitomi? I need you. This party&#146;s no fun if you&#146;re not 
here...&#148; 
 
&#147;I&#146;m here Ranka...&#148; Ranka&#146;s heart leapt as she heard her girlfriend&#146;s 
voice. The dark haired girl turned herself around and ran to Hitomi, 
giving her a quick hug and a peck on the cheek.
 
&#147;Hitomi! You made it!&#148; Ranka said happily.
 
&#147;Of course I did. Happy birthday sweetie.&#148; Hitomi smiled at Ranka, and 
led her over to the dining table to sit down with her. 
 
&#147;I got this for you Ranka, I hope you like it.&#148; Hitomi handed over the 
bag, and Ranka grinned.
 
&#147;Hitomi, you didn&#146;t have to get me anything...&#148; Ranka then suddenly 
stopped speaking as she fished out a small velvet box. Ranka looked at 
Hitomi blankly, but the blonde musician just motioned her to open it 
and see what was inside. Ranka looked back at it and slowly opened the 
box. Ranka harshly gasped when she saw what was inside it. It was a 
sterling silver ring, engraved with the pattern of a Chinese dragon 
and a large, shining sapphire crystal embedded in its crest. The very 
same ring that Ranka had pointed out to Hitomi three months ago, the 
one that cost a fortune...
 
Ranka just looked up at Hitomi, stunned. &#147;...Hitomi...but...how...?&#148;
 
Hitomi grinned triumphantly. &#147;It cost me an arm and a leg, but I 
managed to save up enough money to buy it! Well, do you like it?&#148;
 
Ranka still looked at Ranka, dumbfounded and speechless. {She 
remembered...and she spent all that money on this ring...for me...she 
did all this for me...Hitomi...}
 
Hitomi was extremely happy for the effect this had on Ranka, the 
blonde musician was hoping that Ranka would love it, but grew alarmed 
when she saw a tear slip down the amethyst eyed girl&#146;s face.
 
&#147;Ranka? What&#146;s wrong? Are you alright?&#148;
 
Ranka looked up at Hitomi, her eyes leaking with tears, and gazed into 
her love&#146;s shining sapphire eyes. Ranka felt her heart clench to look 
at her. So beautiful, so mature, so kind, so sweet. Ranka didn&#146;t 
deserve her, she knew that, but she would do all she could to be 
worthy of her love. Hitomi eased a bit as she saw Ranka smile, and the 
blonde gently wiped the tears out of her amethyst eyes.
 
&#147;Are you okay?&#148;
 
&#147;It&#146;s just that, I love you so much Hitomi. I don&#146;t know what I&#146;ve 
done to make you feel the same way I do...but I swear I&#146;ll do what I 
can to be worthy of you. You mean so much to me, I just wanna hold you 
in my arms forever Hitomi...forever...&#148;
 
Hitomi smiled. &#147;I love you too Ranka.&#148;
 
Ranka looked up after putting the ring on and admiring it for a 
second, clasped both of Hitomi&#146;s cheeks and tilted forwards as if to 
kiss Hitomi, but then stopped before she touched the blonde&#146;s lips, 
and thought for a second. 
 
&#147;Don&#146;t I get a kiss then?&#148; Hitomi joked. Ranka would have laughed but 
this was serious. The dark haired girl stood up, and grabbed Hitomi&#146;s 
hand pulling Hitomi up with her. 
 
&#147;Ranka...?&#148; Hitomi asked confusedly. Ranka just put a finger to her 
lips and silenced her.
 
&#147;You did say that your mom would be out tonight, right?&#148; Ranka asked. 
 
Hitomi just nodded, not wishing to break to contact of Ranka&#146;s long 
finger on her lips.
 
&#147;Good. Because were leaving.&#148; Ranka began to drag Hitomi to the door, 
when Hitomi stopped her.
 
&#147;But wait a minute you can&#146;t. This is *your* party. Why are we 
leaving?&#148;
 
Ranka looked at Hitomi blankly. &#147;Will you stay then?&#148;
 
Hitomi looked to the ground. She really wanted to, but Ranka&#146;s other 
friends...
 
&#147;Okay then. So we&#146;re going to your house.&#148; Ranka said.
 
&#147;Why?&#148;
 
&#147;Because I am not going to enjoy this night if you&#146;re not here, and 
besides I...I&#146;ve been thinking a lot lately, and I...I need to be with 
you...&#148;
 
Hitomi became even more confused. &#147;But you are with me.&#148;
 
Ranka held on to Hitomi&#146;s hand even tighter, and looked into Hitomi&#146;s 
eyes so deeply, it caught the blonde musician off guard. 
 
&#147;Not like that...&#148;
 
Hitomi still didn&#146;t understand what Ranka meant by that, but simply 
dismissed it as a sign of deep compassion. Ranka kissed Hitomi on the 
cheek, and led her towards the backdoor. The two left Ranka&#146;s quite 
unnoticed, and headed towards Hitomi&#146;s house. The two were in perfect 
silence. Ranka just seemed to be thinking through some great personal 
struggle, while Hitomi just kept quiet. She could see that Ranka 
wanted a little more then to be alone. After a calm walk, the two 
girls reached Hitomi&#146;s house. Hitomi barely had the time to take her 
coat off, when Ranka dragged her off into the blonde&#146;s room. Ranka 
quickly shut the door behind the two of them, and took a look at her 
Hitomi. So beautiful...she was right to do this...it was time.
 
Hitomi walked up to Ranka and looked at her confusedly. That struggle 
she was going through before was still here, but it looked like she 
made up her mind about what ever it was that she debating to herself 
about.
 
&#147;Ranka...are you okay...?&#148;
 
Ranka didn&#146;t answer her immediately, just sighed and brought Hitomi&#146;s 
hands to rest on her own hips.
 
&#147;I love you Hitomi Benisaki. So can I please show you how much I love 
you?&#148;
 
Hitomi was still confused as to what Ranka meant by that, and looked 
into her shining amethyst eyes for the answer. The windows to her 
Ranka&#146;s soul were calling her, and she could see so much in 
them...love, fear, anxiety but what she truly saw...made her realize 
what it was that Ranka wanted...Hitomi saw desire...Ranka was burning 
for her, it was obvious in her ever action. Ranka was the one for her; 
Hitomi could see that. Perhaps it was time...Hitomi blushed and 
nodded, her gaze moving towards the floor. Ranka needed no further 
encouragement, and graceful hands sought out the supple body of a 
blonde musician. Ranka pulled Hitomi next to her, wrapping her arms 
around neck, and passionately locking lips with her. Hitomi whimpered 
softly, desperate for her Ranka&#146;s touch and opened her lips, deepening 
the kiss as the amethyst-eyed girl&#146;s tongue sought out her own. Things 
got awkward from then, as Ranka fumbled to undo the shirt that Hitomi 
was wearing, and Hitomi tried to amble them towards the bed. After a 
while, Ranka removed the shirt exposing Hitomi&#146;s bra lased chest. The 
amethyst-eyed girl tossed it to the floor, while the blonde musician 
managed lower herself to the bed and pull Ranka down with her, all the 
while still not breaking the kiss. Ranka&#146;s left hand then forcefully 
tried to undo her jeans, while the other caressed Hitomi&#146;s soft cheek. 
Hitomi groaned, as Ranka pulled away from her lips, but gasped loudly, 
as the dark haired girl nibbled and kissed the tender, creamy flesh 
around Hitomi&#146;s neck, still unbuttoning the offending jeans of the 
blonde musician. After a bout of great effort, Ranka removed them, and 
marvelled at her work. Hitomi looked so delicious just laying there, 
in nothing but her underwear, her sapphire eyes so innocent and sodden 
with lust, her soft creamy skin, full pouting lips which, would every 
so often let a soft moan escape them, her endless fountain of rich 
blonde hair...Ranka couldn&#146;t contain what she wanted anymore, and 
kissed Hitomi again, in a haze of nothing but pure desire. Hitomi then 
tried to undo Ranka&#146;s clothes respectively, and whimpered softly into 
Ranka&#146;s mouth, as the amethyst-eyed girl&#146;s gentle hands ran themselves 
around her body...
 
**********
 
At 7.30 the next day, Ms Benisaki walked in from a hard night at the 
hospital. The continual stress and time away from her daughter was 
starting to get to her, but that was her work and she had to do what 
was best for herself and Hitomi. Ms Benisaki looked into the living 
room for the blonde haired musician. She assumed that Hitomi was 
practicing for the pianist who wanted an apprentice in Germany. She 
wasn&#146;t there. Ms Benisaki then realized that she must be asleep, and 
went upstairs to Hitomi&#146;s room. The mother knocked on the door, hoping 
to wake Hitomi. She didn&#146;t like waking her up but she had to know that 
her daughter was okay. She knocked again, but heard nothing so she 
opened the door and looked inside. Ms Benisaki gasped as she saw her 
only daughter, lying naked in her bed wrapped in the arms of her 
friend Ranka, deep in what appeared to be a peaceful slumber. Ranka 
slowly rose and smiled to herself when she became aware of the fact 
that Hitomi was still asleep, next to her. The dark haired girl was 
about to peck her on the cheek, but felt a pair of eyes bore into her. 
Looking over to the doorway, she gazed nervously at an incredulous 
woman. Ranka kept her eyes trained on Ms Benisaki as she lightly 
tapped on Hitomi&#146;s shoulder.
 
&#147;Er...Hitomi...&#148; Hitomi awoke, but didn&#146;t open her eyes or look at 
her.
 
&#147;What, I&#146;m trying to sleep here sweetie...&#148;
 
&#147;Eh Hitomi...&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m tired Ranka, I don&#146;t know if you remember but I had a bit of a 
ruff night last night. Your handy work.&#148;
 
Ranka blushed. &#147;HITOMI!!!&#148;
 
Hitomi became irate. &#147;What is it?! How many times do I need to tell 
you...&#148; Hitomi then cut herself off as she saw her mom in the doorway. 
&#147;Oh...heh, heh, heh...hey mom...&#148;
 
&#147;Care to explain?&#148; said Ms Benisaki.
 
Hitomi rose up a second and leaned back on the headboard of her bed, 
and let her hand seek out Ranka&#146;s. Ranka looked at Hitomi, and smiled 
back at her. It was okay. 
 
&#147;Mom, I didn&#146;t want you to find out this way, but...Ranka and I...well 
we&#146;re in love...&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki&#146;s eyes widened at her daughter&#146;s declaration&#133; the woman 
breathed in slowly, and looked at Ranka.
 
&#147;Can I speak to my daughter alone please?&#148;
 
Ranka blinked but didn&#146;t argue, and stood up, gathering her clothes 
from their pile on the floor, and began to walk out. As she reached 
the door she stopped, and looked back at Hitomi.
 
&#147;Call me if you need anything, okay?&#148;
 
Hitomi nodded. &#147;Okay Ranka.&#148;
 
Ranka then exhaled, and walked out the door. Ms Benisaki closed the 
door behind Ranka and walked over to a now apprehensive Hitomi, and 
sat beside her on the edge of the bed. 
 
&#147;So, how long have you and Ranka been...involved?&#148;
 
**********
 
Ranka was sitting down on the couch, fully dressed and waiting for Ms 
Benisaki and Hitomi to come downstairs. They had been up there for the 
past forty minutes. They must have had a lot to talk about. The 
platinum blonde always said that her mother was open-minded, but from 
the look on her face, that might not be the case. She did not want to 
get in between her and daughter, but want if Ms Benisaki really did 
not approve of them seeing each other? What if she tried to pull them 
apart by forbidding Hitomi to see her? Ranka found that thought much 
more terrifying than she assumed it would be, and instantly thought 
about going up there and pleading her case. Just as Ranka got worked 
up enough to go upstairs, Hitomi and Ms Benisaki came downstairs. 
Hitomi ran into Ranka&#146;s arms and hugged her tightly, as Ms Benisaki 
walked up to them and smiled. Ranka only looked at her questioningly. 
 
&#147;So, does this mean...that you approve of me and Hitomi?&#148; She asked.
 
Hitomi&#146;s mom just nodded, and looked at her seriously.
 
&#147;Yes Ranka. To see the two of you like that then did catch me 
off-guard, but from talking to Hitomi, I can see that you make each 
other happy. And at the end of the day, that&#146;s all I want. Love is 
love and you can&#146;t help who you fall in love with.&#148;
 
Ranka nodded and smiled happily. &#147;Thank you.&#148;
 
**********
 
Three days later, Hitomi found out that the pianist from Germany would 
be delaying his trip by a month, but she was happy for this, it gave 
her a chance to practice for it a bit more. She had really been 
neglecting her practice to spend more time together with Ranka. But 
after then things got ruff between them. Very ruff. 
 
**********
 
Ranka and Hitomi were at school, at lunchtime. The two did seem to be 
pretty much besotted with each other, but for some reason, Ranka was a 
lot more careful and worried about showing their affections in public. 
Ranka didn&#146;t know why she was so fearful, but the fact that Hitomi&#146;s 
mother knew about them made her more nervous. For Hitomi it was the 
exact opposite. She now wanted to be more open with the relationship 
and was letting her guard down more and more, especially at school. 

Hitomi led Ranka to the outside of the northern block of the school, 
around the bike shed, with a mischievous look on her face. Ranka 
blushed at her, and looked around for anyone.

&#147;We can&#146;t do that now, Hitomi...&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi just pushed Ranka up to the back of the shed and against the 
wall. The musician raised her eyebrows suggestively, as her hands 
travelled around Ranka&#146;s body. 
 
&#147;Can you really say no to *me* Ranka?&#148; Hitomi asked.
 
Ranka would have protested at that, but found that she couldn&#146;t. She 
actually couldn&#146;t say no to Hitomi no matter what she felt like. Ranka 
pulled Hitomi in closer to her, and lightly kissed her. Hitomi giggled 
slightly, and let her hands drop to Ranka&#146;s slender waist. Ranka, 
driven by her desire, pressed her lips onto Hitomi&#146;s more forcefully, 
but instantly jerked back when she heard footsteps. 

The blonde musician gasped as she felt Ranka pull away so abruptly, 
and wondered what was wrong, but caught on as she saw three boys walk 
past them. They didn&#146;t see Ranka or Hitomi, and the dark-haired girl 
sighed in relief. Hitomi&#146;s face twisted into an angry expression. The 
blonde musician began to walk away, but was halted when Ranka grasped 
her wrist. 
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong Hitomi?&#148; The blonde didn&#146;t look back, just tugged her 
arm back, which stunned Ranka.
 
&#147;I&#146;m sick and tired of hiding Ranka. We&#146;re in love. We shouldn&#146;t have 
to keep on hiding and cowering. My mother knows, Tomaru knows, why 
hide it?&#148;
 
Ranka looked away. She could sense that what she did upset Hitomi, a 
little more than she expected it to.
 
&#147;We will tell everyone Hitomi, now&#146;s just not the time...I just can&#146;t 
do that right now.&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi turned back. &#147;Well when will be the time?&#148;
 
&#147;When I&#146;m ready.&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi sighed, as if out of exhaustion. &#147;I keep hearing that from you. 
&#145;When I&#146;m ready&#146;...I don&#146;t understand you Ranka...&#148;
 
&#147;What?&#148;
 
&#147;You say you love me but you&#146;re not even prepared to tell people about 
us...&#148; Hitomi trailed off.
 
&#147;I do want to tell everyone about me and you, it&#146;s just...my 
friends...&#148;
 
Hitomi stepped forwards and smirked at her cynically.
 
&#147;Your friends? I don&#146;t believe you! The last time I checked there were 
two people in this relationship, you and me, not you, me and your 
friends. I&#146;m tired of you bring them into this.&#148;
 
Ranka looked angry for a second, and looked directly at Hitomi, 
unaware that someone was watching the two of them...
 
&#147;You can&#146;t expect me to turn away my friends like that...&#148;
 
&#147;I am not asking you to turn them away, I&#146;m asking you to be honest. 
And if they were your real friends that wouldn&#146;t matter.&#148;

Ranka&#146;s anger deflated. Hitomi was raising arguments that she couldn&#146;t 
fight against. 
 
&#147;Please Hitomi...can&#146;t we just forget about this right now? I love 
you.&#148; Ranka said, trying in vain to hold Hitomi, but being pushed back 
in the process of doing this.
 
&#147;I don&#146;t think you mean that Ranka.&#148; Hitomi looked away. She didn&#146;t 
like saying this but it had to be said. 
 
Ranka&#146;s face beamed her own confusion, and a little more anger from 
Hitomi saying that. The dark haired girl stepped forward, closer to 
Ranka, and held her arms in place, shooting a withering glare at her.
 
&#147;How can you say things like that? You know I love you, you shouldn&#146;t 
even doubt it!&#148;
 
&#147;Love isn&#146;t something you can just switch on and off! You aren&#146;t even 
going to tell people about us; yet you still claim to love me? If 
that&#146;s true then you must be ashamed of me! Is that it? Are you 
ashamed of me?&#148; Hitomi yelled, her sapphire eyes filling with tears 
simply to comprehend that, let alone say it&#133; Ranka became so confused 
that she could get her head around the situation...why was Hitomi 
doing this?
 
&#147;Of course not Hitomi! I&#146;m not ashamed of you!&#148; Ranka said, trying 
desperately to end this.
 
&#147;Then why? Why can&#146;t we tell everyone how we feel? Why do we have to 
play this stupid game of hide and wait?&#148;
 
&#147;Because I don&#146;t want my friends to know I&#146;m a...&#148; Ranka stopped 
herself, before she said too much, but it was too late, Hitomi had 
already caught on to her implications&#133;
 
&#147;A what? &#133; A what?! A lesbian?! Is that what this is about? Your 
sexuality? Your image? I should have known shouldn&#146;t I? That&#146;s what it 
all boils down to, doesn&#146;t it? It doesn&#146;t matter that we love each 
other; all that matters is that we&#146;re both girls right?! I thought you 
were different Ranka. I thought you and I had something special, but I 
was wrong. You&#146;re just like they are...all you care about is how you 
look in front of everyone...I think Tomaru was right about you...&#148;
 
Ranka started to cry at Hitomi&#146;s outburst...it wasn&#146;t like that. 
Hitomi herself began to back away, barely able to see through all the 
tears in her eyes. 
 
&#147;Hitomi please...I&#146;m not like they are...I&#146;m not...I just...&#148; Ranka 
was so distraught she couldn&#146;t even finish her sentences... 
 
&#147;No&#133; I can&#146;t do this Ranka&#133; I can&#146;t keep living a lie. You have to 
decide right now...either you come with me now and we tell everyone 
about us, or...&#148; Hitomi sobbed. &#147;...or it&#146;s over...&#148;
 
Ranka&#146;s head shot up in total surprise, tears falling from her face.
 
&#147;No Hitomi! You can&#146;t mean that!&#148; Ranka yelled, at this point not 
caring who heard, but it was too late to make a difference. 
 
&#147;Just choose Ranka. Say what you really want...&#148;
 
Ranka trembled. She loved Hitomi with all her heart and soul...but her 
friends&#133;they would always be here for her...she&#146;d have to lose one of 
the two but the dark-haired girl didn&#146;t want to lose either...Ranka 
looked down to the floor, unable to answer her, the tears on her face 
spilling onto the stone ground. 

Hitomi gasped in shock as Ranka did not answer her, and she took that 
as Ranka&#146;s way of saying she&#146;d rather end it. The blonde musician 
shook her head in disbelief as she backed away&#133; and just ran. She 
didn&#146;t care where she was going, it didn&#146;t seem to matter, and she 
just ran, crying her eyes out. Ranka looked up to see Hitomi dash 
away, and was about to follow, when the man from across who watching 
them stepped up. It was Tomaru, and he had seen everything. Tomaru 
threw a look of disgust at Ranka, not saying anything to her, and ran 
in the direction that Hitomi left at. Ranka collapsed to the ground in 
tears, and sobbed openly, letting her face fall into her hands. Why 
did this have to happen? Why?
 
**********
 
An hour later, Hitomi was at a park outside of school, in Tomaru&#146;s 
arms crying her eyes out. She know that it was against school rules to 
leave the grounds during school hours and that classes would start 
again in about five minutes, but she didn&#146;t seem to care. She had just 
lost the woman she loved and the woman who she thought loved her 
back...
 
&#147;M-maybe I was too h-harsh Tomaru...&#148; Hitomi said, her face burried 
into the auburn haired boy&#146;s chest, her voice still racked with sobs. 

Tomaru hated this. She knew Ranka would hurt Hitomi but didn&#146;t say a 
damn thing. This was his fault. He let his best friend be manipulated 
by that self-centred little...
 
&#147;No Hitomi. You did the right thing. Ranka doesn&#146;t deserve you.&#148; He 
said, gently cradling the platinum blonde in his arms. 
 
&#147;But I&#133;I made her choose between me and her friends, that&#146;s selfish 
isn&#146;t it? W-what if she asked me t-to choose between you and her? I 
might have done the same thing...what have I done?&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m telling you, you did the right thing. It&#146;ll be alright Hitomi, I 
promise you...&#148; Tomaru said. The blonde musician continued to cry, not 
able to say anything more.
 
**********
 
Four hours later, Ms Benisaki was sitting on her couch watching TV, 
when the phone rang. The blonde haired mother stood up, and picked up 
the receiver.
 
&#147;Hello?&#148; 
 
&#147;Ms Benisaki?&#148; 
 
&#147;Ranka? Hi, how are you?&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m okay, I&#133;I just need to speak to Hitomi. Is she there?&#148;
 
&#147;No I&#146;m sorry, she&#146;s at Tomaru&#146;s house, she just phoned a minute ago 
to tell me that.&#148;
 
&#147;Oh. Okay. Sorry to bother you. Goodbye, Ms Benisaki.&#148;

&#147;Ur, bye Ranka.&#148;
 
With that Ranka hung up. Ms Benisaki then became puzzled. Ranka seemed 
so sad and her voice was broken, like she had been crying for a while. 
And in her heart, Ms Benisaki felt it had something to do with Hitomi&#133;
 
&#147;I wonder if...something happened between them&#133;&#148;
 
 
**********
 
The next day at school, things were hard for both of them. Ranka would 
come to class and sit down, waiting for Hitomi. When she got there, 
Hitomi would just take a seat and ignore her. All through the class, 
Ranka would throw glances in her direction, but the blonde either 
didn&#146;t notice or didn&#146;t care, because she never responded. For Hitomi 
it was equally hard. She knew if she looked back at Ranka, she&#146;d break 
out into another bout of tears. And she was tired of that for the most 
part. Although it did make her feel a little better, she felt so 
guilty about dropping her problems on Tomaru like that, but he said 
that he didn&#146;t mind looking after his best friend.

After the class, Hitomi left quickly, she was too fearful that Ranka 
might try to talk to her. She was right though. Ranka did want to 
speak to her, but Hitomi was too quick. Later on in the day, Hitomi 
want to the library, to get a geography book for the next test that 
was coming up. The blonde saw a book that caught her eye on the top of 
the geography shelf, and stood on her toes, fumbling to reach it, her 
fingertips gently grazing it. A hand then smoothly grabbed the book 
and brought it down. Hitomi turned around, looking at the person who 
took it for her, or from her. It was Ranka, holding it in her left 
hand, a bland facial expression, no happiness nor sadness nor anger, 
just expressionless...
 
{...Ranka...} Hitomi thought.
 
&#147;Here Hitomi. This was the book you wanted wasn&#146;t it?&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi would have instantly started crying, but she didn&#146;t want Ranka 
to see her weak. The blonde just nodded, grabbed the book and walked 
away from her, saying a quick &#145;thank you&#146; as she left. Ranka didn&#146;t 
know how she felt about that. She would have liked it if Hitomi had 
shown some sign of...emotion, but the blonde wasn&#146;t happy or 
angry...it felt like she was already moving on...Ranka wouldn&#146;t let 
that happen to them. She was desperate to find a way back into the 
musician&#146;s heart, no matter what it took. By the time Ranka turned 
around to get Hitomi to talk to her, she had checked out the book, and 
was going to leave. Then Ranka cursed in dismay, as Hitomi walked into 
Saki, one of Ranka&#146;s &#145;friends&#146;.

Hitomi recognised the girl before her as Saki, a close friend of 
Ranka&#146;s and one on the people that Hitomi and Ranka argued about. She 
would have been much more civil to this girl, but part of her wanted 
to let her anger loose on her, even though she really didn&#146;t do 
anything wrong.
 
&#147;Excuse me.&#148; Hitomi said, a hint of hostility in her voice. 
 
Saki smirked. &#147;What&#146;s the magic word?&#148;
 
&#147;I don&#146;t have time for this.&#148; Hitomi said. 
 
&#147;Well then you better make time. You need to learn to be a lot more 
polite to people.&#148;
 
Hitomi exhaled. &#147;Can you please, get out of my way?&#148; Hitomi said, 
already starting to get annoyed. 
 
&#147;Is that the best you can do? Try again.&#148; Saki said, sneering. 
 
&#147;I said get out of my way!&#148;
 
&#147;Excuse me? Who the hell do you think you&#146;re talking to?&#148;
 
&#147;A stuck-up, narcissistic little bimbo that everyone despises but is 
too afraid to say it!&#148; Hitomi yelled out, shocking everyone around 
them who had now turned to watch this, and herself.
 
&#147;You&#146;re one to talk, at least my father didn&#146;t abandon me&#133;&#148;
 
That shot Hitomi straight in the heart, and the blonde shoved Saki out 
of her way as she started crying, running down the hall. Ranka felt 
how deep that cut as if it was directed to her, and it instantly gave 
birth to anger so strong she felt it burn in her veins&#133; Ranka charged 
over to the door, with no intention of speaking to Saki, when the girl 
in question stopped her. 
 
&#147;Ranka? Don&#146;t tell me you&#146;re going to chase down that little geek? 
Forget her, what does she matte- (Whap!!!)&#148; 
 
Before she could finish speaking, the girl was sharply silenced by a 
slap so loud it echoed through the library. Saki fell to her knees 
holding her cheek that was now a very bright red, and stared at Ranka, 
dumbfounded by her actions. The amethyst-eyed girl glared at her, she 
was so full of fury that she would have done more, but she was just 
too concerned about Hitomi at that point.
 
&#147;Hitomi was right about you. You&#146;re not my friend at all. In fact I 
probably dislike you now more than I have anyone.&#148; 
 
Ranka then ran out the door, leaving a particularly embarrassed and 
shocked Saki in her wake. The dark haired girl searched for Hitomi, 
but couldn&#146;t find her, and nearly gave up until she walked passed the 
bathrooms and heard someone weeping. Ranka moved slowly inside, and 
saw Hitomi there, obviously deeply hurt by what Saki said. She would 
have moved closer to comfort her, but due to the present 
circumstances, she opted not to push her luck. 
   
&#147;Hitomi are you okay?&#148; Ranka asked, genuinely concerned. 
 
A frosty irritation claimed Hitomi&#146;s heart. Ranka had followed her. 
The musician clenched her fist tightly and swiftly wiped the tears of 
her now puffy eyes, and looked away from her ex hatefully.
 
&#147;What do you care, you have what you want don&#146;t you?&#148; Hitomi snapped.
 
The dark haired girl didn&#146;t take Hitomi&#146;s hostility to heart, but it 
still hurt her. However, Ranka then decided she didn&#146;t care what 
Hitomi felt about her, and walked close to her comfort her anyway. 
Ranka rested her arms on Hitomi&#146;s shoulders, but the blonde girl only 
froze at her touch.
 
&#147;But Hitomi...I...&#148;
 
&#147;Don&#146;t touch me! Just go back to those friends you care so damn much 
about!&#148; Hitomi yelled right at Ranka, and stormed out of the toilets, 
crying once again. Ranka looked on in dejection.
 
{What am I supposed to do to get her to talk to me?} 
 
*********
 
Later on after school, Hitomi went home, still saddened by what Saki 
had said to her. She hated how things were between her and Ranka. Part 
of her just wanted to go back to Ranka; the other part wanted nothing 
to do with her. The melancholy girl reached her home, and she took out 
her key, went inside, and locked the door. Ms Benisaki then stepped 
forwards out of the living room, and gave Hitomi a concerned glare.
 
&#147;Are you okay, Hitomi?&#148; She asked.
 
&#147;I-I&#146;m fine Mom. Don&#146;t worry about me.&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki didn&#146;t seem to be convinced though.
 
&#147;Ranka called yesterday when you were at Tomaru&#146;s house. She seemed 
really troubled Hitomi. Do you know what happened to her?&#148;
 
Hitomi looked away. &#147;We broke up Mom. But I really don&#146;t feel like 
talking about it right now though. Can we leave it alone for now?&#148;
 
&#147;Sure Sweetie. Just remember I&#146;m here to talk if you need me yeah?&#148;
 
&#147;Okay. Thanks Mom.&#148; Hitomi said, as she walked up to her room.
 
Ms Benisaki just looked at her daughter with a growing distress. She 
did not see a reason for the two of them to break up, but she knew 
that without Ranka, Hitomi might be driven back into an obsession with 
the piano...
 
**********
 
The next few days went by quite quickly, but never easily. Hitomi 
continued to ignore and avoid Ranka. Even though she thought a gap 
between the two of them might turn Ranka away, it actually hardened 
the amethyst-eyed girl&#146;s resolve. Ranka would not lose without the 
blonde musician without a fight, and she kept on trying to talk to 
Hitomi. This morning as Ranka looked for her ex-girlfriend, she saw 
that Hitomi was talking to a guy. At first Ranka didn&#146;t seem to have a 
problem with it, but then suddenly felt a pang of jealousy as she 
realized that he was flirting with her. It may not have seemed like 
much, but Hitomi was not flirted with very often. This guy probably 
liked the musician a lot, and was not intimidated by her smarts. And 
Hitomi herself seemed to eating it up. Even though that air of sadness 
was still around her, Hitomi was smiling shyly at his advances. Ranka 
waited until they finished talking, and as he left, Ranka immediately 
went over there.
 
Hitomi sighed when she saw Ranka approach her. The two of them were 
now on speaking terms, but it was still awkward when she was around...
 
&#147;Hitomi can we please talk?&#148; Ranka said, walking up next to Hitomi. 
 
Hitomi exhaled. &#147;I don&#146;t think there is much we need to talk about.&#148;
 
&#147;Yes there is...we can&#146;t let it end like this.&#148;
 
Hitomi looked at Ranka like she was growing a second head. Couldn&#146;t 
she understand?
 
&#147;It&#146;s too late for that Ranka. Much too late.&#148; Hitomi said.
 
&#147;It can&#146;t be! I still...&#148; Ranka trailed off, and realized she just 
made another big mistake...
 
&#147;You still? You still what Ranka? You sure you want to say that here? 
Someone might here you.&#148; Hitomi said disbelievingly. 
 
&#147;I-I deserve that. Please can we talk?&#148; Ranka asked quietly.
 
&#147;...I can&#146;t...I&#146;m going to meet Mamoru.&#148;
 
Ranka&#146;s face darkened. &#147;Who&#146;s Mamoru?&#148;
 
&#147;Not that it&#146;s any of you business, but he&#146;s the guy that&#146;s taking me 
to this dance on Friday.&#148;
 
Hitomi turned to leave, but was stopped as Ranka held her wrist firm. 
The blonde musician looked back at the dark haired girl in disbelief, 
but was returned with an equally incredulous stare.
 
&#147;What? But wait a minute you can&#146;t-&#148; Before Ranka could finish; Hitomi 
cut her off, and yanked her arm back. 
 
&#147;Excuse me? Who are you to tell me whom I can and can&#146;t see? We&#146;re not 
dating any more!&#148;
 
&#147;But I...&#148;
 
&#147;Stay the hell away from me Ranka!&#148; Hitomi yelled, and walked down the 
hall, away from a shocked and increasingly miserable Ranka. 
 
**********
 
It was Friday, 8.00. The day of the dance had arrived. Since their 
argument, Hitomi and Ranka had not spoken to each other. But the 
amethyst-eyed girl was still trying to find a way to get Hitomi back 
into her arms. Ranka came to the dance alone, not because someone 
hadn&#146;t asked her, but because she didn&#146;t want to give Hitomi out the 
message that she had moved on with her life. Which was the exact 
signal that Hitomi was giving out herself. This &#145;Mamoru&#146; guy...
 
Ranka leaned in on the far wall, blocking all the dancing and music 
that was thundering around her. For some reason she really didn&#146;t feel 
like coming here. Ranka felt so tired lately, and she remembered with 
some self-pity that she cried herself to sleep last night.
 
{Has she really moved on, I mean I know she likes men and women 
but...has she really found something with this guy? Or is she trying 
to make me...jealous? If she is, it&#146;s working. I hate the way things 
are between Hitomi and me. I just wish she&#146;d let me talk to her...}
 
Just over at the other side of the hall, Ranka saw Mamoru stroll in 
with Hitomi on his arm. Ranka felt her heart beat race to look at her. 
Hitomi was always so beautiful...and suddenly she felt something that 
resembled a cross between, anger, jealousy and despair, when she 
realized how good they looked together. The dark haired girl didn&#146;t 
seem to care about that though, and went over to them to say hello. 
Hitomi and Mamoru stood by the doorway admiring the scene before them. 
The auditorium looked so much more different then it looked before. 
Hitomi then looked around for Tomaru, but couldn&#146;t see him and found 
Ranka instead. Hitomi would have turned to leave but she felt a little 
guilty about yelling at Ranka the way she did the other day. Ranka 
stopped just in front of Hitomi and Mamoru, ignoring Mamoru for the 
most part, and smiled mildly at Hitomi, fairly pleased that the blonde 
musician didn&#146;t run from her.
 
&#147;Hi. You look great Hitomi...&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi plastered a small smile on her face, temporarily forgetting 
about the situation between the two of them.
 
&#147;Thanks Ranka, you look nice too.&#148;
 
Mamoru turned to look at Hitomi and began to lead her away, getting 
some death looks that went largely unnoticed, from Ranka.
 
&#147;You want to dance now Hitomi?&#148; He said.
 
Hitomi looked nervously between Mamoru and Ranka, and answered him, 
still uncertain about how she should approach this.
 
&#147;Uhr...well...yeah, sure...&#148; 
 
Hitomi then walked away with Mamoru arm in arm, onto the dance floor. 
Ranka&#146;s eyes narrowed, while looking at the two of them. She could 
sense that this guy could be an obstacle...
 
Later on that night, about 2 and &frac12; hours later, Ranka was sitting down 
by the side of the hall, with about three other people around her who 
gabbed to themselves about the night, but she kept her eyes locked on 
Hitomi and Mamoru. She hadn&#146;t really realized that she had clenched 
her fists at the sight of them together...the two of them danced next 
to each other so close that it was driving Ranka insane. Then she 
became even angrier, when she saw Mamoru&#146;s hands slip below Hitomi&#146;s 
waist... 
 
{I&#146;m gonna kill him...}
 
Ranka then stood irately up, and had every intention of running over 
there and pulling Tomaru off of Hitomi, when she felt someone quickly 
grab her arm to restrain her.
	It was Tomaru, holding her back. Some how she felt like Tomaru 
was right to hold her back, but at this point she was too mad to care. 
 
&#147;What the hell do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148; Ranka yelled.
 
Tomaru ignored the heated response, and spoke to her quite calmly, 
still not letting go of Ranka.
 
&#147;I know what you want to do Ranka. And you are not going over there. 
This is Hitomi&#146;s decision.&#148; 
 
Ranka jerked her arm back quickly and turned around to face him. 
 
&#147;Excuse me? This has nothing to do with you!&#148;
 
&#147;It has everything to do with me Ranka, she&#146;s my best friend, and if 
that guy makes her happy, neither you nor me can stand in the way of 
that.&#148;
 
Ranka lowered her head. Tomaru had a point.
 
&#147;But...I can&#146;t just let him steal her away from me...I...&#148;
&#147;He&#146;s not stealing Hitomi away from you, you made your choice, and now 
you have to live with it.&#148;
 
&#147;That doesn&#146;t make it hurt any less!!&#148; Ranka shouted, not noticing the 
tears that were now pouring from her eyes. Tomaru looked at Ranka 
inquisitively. He knew that he didn&#146;t like her, but he could see that 
she legitimately cared for Hitomi...
 
&#147;...I&#146;m sorry...&#148; Tomaru said apologetically.
 
Tears run down Ranka&#146;s cheeks. Tomaru gently held her to his side. For 
the first time, he saw Ranka in a different light. She wasn&#146;t as self 
absorbed as people said she was.
 
&#147;You...still love her don&#146;t you?&#148;
 
Ranka sniffled a bit. &#147;Of course I do.&#148;
 
&#147;I didn&#146;t want to end it with her, I really didn&#146;t. But she forced me 
to choose between my friends and my love...I just couldn&#146;t answer her. 
I wouldn&#146;t expect Hitomi to choose between you and me...but I do 
understand. It&#146;s only now that I realize, that she was right. Those 
guys aren&#146;t really my friends at all. I love her with every beat of my 
heart Tomaru, and it&#146;s tearing me up inside to see her with him...&#148;
 
Ranka broke into more sobs in Tomaru&#146;s chest, but he allowed her to 
stay there. He finally understood Ranka, and he now regretted turning 
Hitomi against her. She really was good for his friend; he just hoped 
it wasn&#146;t too late to get them back together. 
 
**********
 
Later on after the dance, Hitomi let Mamoru walk her home. She didn&#146;t 
need him to, but she thought it might ward away Ranka. Anyway, as she 
got home, Mamoru walked her to the door. He could see that Mamoru 
wanted to know if this was going to go anywhere. Hitomi knew that 
Mamoru really liked her, but she just...
 
&#147;Uhr...thanks for taking me to the dance at school Mamoru.&#148; Hitomi 
said uncomfortably. 
 
Mamoru smiled and moved in closer to her. 
 
&#147;No problem, just tell me that that you wanna go out with me again.&#148;
 
Mamoru held Hitomi by the waist and deeply kissed her. Hitomi recoiled 
quickly, almost out of disgust, confusing then young man. 
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Mamoru asked, shocked at her reaction.
 
&#147;Nothing, it&#146;s not you it&#146;s just...I still...love her&#133;&#148;
 
Mamoru&#146;s eyebrow rose. &#147;Her...?&#148;
 
Hitomi fumbled to take the key out of her purse, and awkwardly slotted 
it in the keyhole. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, I just can&#146;t...!&#148;
 
And with that, Hitomi went inside, with not even a goodbye to the 
confused young man. Mamoru just sighed and walked away. Unknowing 
either Hitomi or Mamoru, Ranka was across the road, and had seen all 
of it. Tomaru told her to go to Hitomi and talk to her, and ended up 
seeing that...
 
&#147;She still loves me...maybe there is hope...&#148; 
 
**********
 
The next day was Saturday. Hitomi&#146;s big recital, and she had been 
practicing a lot lately. Her mom asked her if it had something to do 
with Ranka, and she was right, but she didn&#146;t tell her mom that. She 
knew that her mother meant well, but she didn&#146;t like talking about the 
Ranka situation. And now she was her was in her room, drying her hair 
after thinking about it. She still loved Ranka, but she would not go 
back to Ranka if she had to hide her affections again. 

Downstairs, Ranka was knocking on the door. After what she saw last 
night, he wished for a chance with Hitomi. And now she had Tomaru&#146;s 
support, she would stop at nothing to find a place in the blonde 
musician&#146;s heart again. Ms Benisaki came to the door and greeted Ranka 
happily.
 
&#147;Hello Ranka.&#148; 
 
&#147;Hi Ms Benisaki. Is Hitomi home?&#148;
 
Ms Benisaki smiled at her eagerness to see her daughter.
 
&#147;Yes she is, just go on up to her room. And please try to talk things 
out?&#148; She asked. Ranka only nodded, and walked past her, going 
upstairs to Hitomi&#146;s room. Ranka knocked quietly, and heard Hitomi 
inside.
 
&#147;Come in.&#148; 
 
Ranka slowly when inside to see Hitomi with her back to the door, 
trying to brush her long golden hair, but seemed to be having trouble 
with it.
 
Hitomi assumed it was her mother. &#147;Mom, could you help me?&#148;
 
Ranka blinked, and lowered her head. &#147;It&#146;s me Hitomi.&#148;
 
The platinum blonde gasped and instantly looked around at the doorway 
as she heard and recognised that voice.
 
&#147;Ranka?&#148; Hitomi said, who stopped brushing her hair to look at her.
 
&#147;Please Hitomi, before you throw me out can we please talk? I won&#146;t 
force anything on you I swear, I just need to speak to you. That&#146;s 
all.&#148; 
 
Hitomi considered in for a second, and nodded to allow Ranka to state 
her case. Ranka sat down on the bed next to her, any tried to gather 
her thoughts. This was her one chance and she didn&#146;t want to blow it. 
The amethyst-eyed girl then took a look at the brush beside Hitomi.
 
&#147;Need some help?&#148; Ranka asked. 
 
Hitomi only looked at her, and gently nodded. Ranka then picked up the 
brush, placing it at the back of Hitomi&#146;s head, and smoothly brought 
it down through her long mane of blonde hair. 
 
&#147;I miss you.&#148; Ranka said.
 
Hitomi didn&#146;t immediately answer. &#147;...I miss you too.&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry about what happened between us. I didn&#146;t want to lose you 
at all. And you were right, people like Saki aren&#146;t really my friends 
and I know that now. I just, couldn&#146;t pick between...&#148;
 
&#147;I know.&#148; Hitomi cut her off. &#147;I know. I&#146;m sorry too. It was unfair of 
me to put you in that position. And I&#146;m also sorry about the way I&#146;ve 
been treating you lately...it&#146;s just hard.&#148;
 
Ranka sighed. &#147;I can understand it Hitomi. I...I just want to make 
things right between us...I hate the way we&#146;re not talking to each 
other...&#148;
 
Hitomi looked back at Ranka, throwing an unreadable look at the 
amethyst-eyed girl. 
 
&#147;I-I still care for you Ranka.&#148; She said.
 
Ranka looked away. &#147;But what about Mamoru?&#148;
 
&#147;He doesn&#146;t mean anything to me. I only went out with him to try and 
get over you, but...I couldn&#146;t...&#148;
 
&#147;Do you...s-still love me Hitomi?&#148; Ranka asked, tears already on the 
verge of spilling over.
 
&#147;I never stopped loving you Ranka Yanagi...&#148;
 
Hitomi moved closer to Ranka as the girl stopped brushing her hair, 
and smiled as she gently pressed her lips up against Ranka&#146;s. The girl 
could only gasp, before Hitomi kissed her. This was such a missed 
feeling...the calming experience of having Hitomi&#146;s sweet lips perched 
on her own...Hitomi pulled back, and looked at her seriously.
 
&#147;Do you want to try this again?&#148;
 
Ranka was still spaced out by the feeling of Hitomi&#146;s kiss, and gently 
placed her fingers along her lips, still feeling the electricity 
there...
 
&#147;Yes Hitomi...anything... I&#146;ll do anything.&#148;
 
Hitomi then brought Ranka&#146;s hands into her lap. 
 
&#147;Then I want to tell everyone about us. Grant me that and I&#146;ll never 
leave you again Ranka.&#148;
 
Ranka nodded, she was ready now. She knew how much she loved Hitomi 
and that she wanted to be with her forever. Hitomi smiled and threw 
herself into Ranka&#146;s arms, so blissful to have her Ranka back. The 
amethyst-eyed girl beamed and she held Hitomi in her arms, speaking 
softly to her.
 
&#147;I love you Hitomi...&#148;
