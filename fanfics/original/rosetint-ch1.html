<h1>Rose Tinted Sex</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The streetlights cast pools of light in the inky
darkness, shining islands of relative safety in the
night. The blonde haired woman stood just at the edge
of the light, in a casual pose that showed off her
long legs and a shapely body without being too
obvious. The leather skirt was sinfully short, a
silvery chain holding it up, and the red velvet top
was cut dangerously low.

&#39;Next time,&#39; Lisa thought with some amusement as she
tried her best not to shiver in the cold, &#39;I&#39;m wearing
a coat with this outfit.&#39;

While beautiful looking Lisa&#39;s eyes were also wary,
scanning her surroundings with a dangerous sort of
intensity. She had been working the streets for nearly
a year now and had no illusions about the kind of
dangers that she faced, though she did like to believe
she was better prepared than most. More than one of
her johns had a surprise when she demonstrated her
martial arts training on them, not to mention
everything she had picked up fighting dirty on the
streets.

A soft rumble of an engine had her scanning the
darkness, and a car smoothly came around the corner of
the industrial district. A British import the sleek
little car gleamed beneath the street lamps, a hard
eyed woman sitting behind the wheel. She looked almost
like she was wearing a uniform, the gleam of gold
buttons visible on the collar of her jacket and her
brown hair tucked up under a simple black cap.

AS the car slid to a stop one of the tinted rear
windows rolled down, a universal signal to Lisa.
Smoothly walking on her high heels she strode over,
stopping with a smile as she tried to get a look at
the figure in the back. &quot;Is there something I can help
you with?&quot; she asked.

The figure moved forward so that the light could
penetrate the darkness and Lisa could make out that it
was a woman, her long red hair flowing over her
shoulders. She wore a simple dress, pure ebony, and
that along with the darkness gave her skin a pale
glow. Her voice was whisky smooth as she purred, &quot;Oh.
I&#39;m sure you can help.&quot; The back door swung open as
the thin but clearly beautiful woman said, &quot;Would you
care to step inside to talk about it?&quot;

Lisa gracefully slid inside, the leather of the seat
sliding against her bare legs, the spicy scent of the
inside of the car washing over her. A black screen
shielded the back from the driver, a well stocked
mini-bar set up to one side and a small television
over on the other. &#39;Not at all cheap,&#39; she thought,
suddenly wondering why this woman was out trolling for
prostitutes. &quot;Shopping for something for the hubby?&quot;
Lisa asked directly.

The woman&#39;s lips curled up in a slight smile, her long
nailed hand reaching out to rest on Lisa&#39;s thigh. She
let it rest there, half way up as she gazed with
hungry eyes at the girl beside her as she said, &quot;No,
only for myself.&quot;

Lisa felt her pulse jump at the touch, but she kept
her face carefully neutral as the car smoothly drove
on. She&#39;d had one or two female customers before, and
if she was honest she would have to admit that she had
enjoyed both experiences. Lisa had even been tempted
to seek out such encounters again, but common sense
had convinced her not to.

The woman&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement and a bit of
desire as she noted Lisa&#39;s reaction, &quot;Good, you&#39;re not
afraid.&quot; She surprisingly removed her hand and sat
back casually on the seat as she said in a sexy growl,
&quot;We&#39;re going someplace more comfortable, though it
would be fun to take you right here, lovely one.&quot;

&quot;Lisa,&quot; she offered softly, her thoughts racing as she
imagined being stripped naked and spread out on all of
this leather.

&quot;Lovely Lisa,&quot; the woman smiled again, her red lips
never parting even slightly. She looked amused, &quot;You
can call me Dominique, little one.&quot;

&#39;It mat not be her real name but I think it suits
her,&#39; Lisa mused as she tried to meet her eyes. There
was an aura about the other woman, something that let
her rule the atmosphere of the little compartment.
Lisa knew almost nothing about this lady but somehow
she wanted to surrender to her, to a wild sort of
abandon.

&quot;So what are your limits, Lisa?&quot; Dominique asked as
her hand reached out to gently brush some blonde hair
from her eyes.

Lisa felt her nipples harden, shocked at her body&#39;s
intense reaction to a casual touch. She made herself
breathe deep, the spicy scent washing over her again.
&quot;I&#39;m willing to go pretty far,&quot; she murmured, &quot;if the
price is right.&quot;

There was a flash on annoyance on Dominique&#39;s face,
almost as if she didn&#39;t want to be reminded this was a
pay encounter. &quot;You&#39;ll be more than compensated,&quot; she
answered flatly. A breath, &quot;I want you to pick a
safeword.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Lisa blinked.

&quot;A safeword,&quot; Dominique looked at her with a odd sort
of gentleness as she explained, &quot;I intend to have my
way with you tonight, in every imaginable way and in a
few that you might not even dream of.&quot; Her green eyes
were just a bit sad as she explained, &quot;If it gets too
much you&#39;ll need a word to signal me to let you go.&quot;

Lisa shivered, a gush of liquid wetting her panties as
she felt her excitement grow. &quot;Ivory,&quot; she murmured,
thinking of the lovely tone of the woman&#39;s skin.

The car smoothly came to a halt, the screen that was
separating them from the driver lowering enough for
her to say, &quot;We&#39;re home, madam.&quot;

Dominique opened the door first, then turned back to
take Lisa&#39;s hand and help her out. The townhouse that
they were standing in front of was surprisingly
classy, in an expensive part of town. The driver
swiftly locked up the car and went to the front door,
opening it for them and waiting patiently until they
walked through.

&quot;Natasha, let Nocturne know that I&#39;m home,&quot; Dominique
said as she gently took Lisa&#39;s arm ad led her down the
hall, &quot;and not to expect me for a few hours.&quot;

&#39;Hours?&#39; Lisa thought in surprise.

&quot;Very good, madam,&quot; Natasha smiled, giving Lisa what
was clearly a sympathetic glance before slipping away
silently.

As Lisa walked beside Dominique she quickly took in
their surroundings. The hallways they walked through
were beautifully decorated, almost enough to take
one&#39;s breath away. Expensive drapery, paintings, and
the occasional piece of fine pottery on a pedestal
were placed in the halls, all the symbols of great
wealth. Much like the beautiful maid, also a symbol
that the people who lived here could afford to employ
her.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Lisa murmured softly, slowing to a
stop as her eyes were taken in by one of the paintings
hung there.

The woman was dressed in armor, riding upon a great
rearing steed. Her cape flowed behind her as the
battlefield raged around her, light shining down upon
her like the gaze of a welcoming god. The lady was
beautiful in a way, but there was something odd about
her, almost a sense of danger in those too bright
eyes.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Dominique agreed, &quot;she is lovely.&quot;

&quot;I thought that was a older painting?&quot; Lisa questioned
softly.

They turned a corner as Dominique smiled wryly, &quot;You
have no idea.&quot;

Lisa felt her breath catch in her throat as Dominique
opened the door at the end of the hall, revealing the
most opulent bedroom she had seen in years. It was
almost old fashioned, but clearly designed to look
that way. None of the furnishings were all that old,
they were just in older styles, set up to resemble a
room from a long lost age. A simple dressing table,
sideboard, wardrobe and other furnishings were
overshadowed by the canopied bed, covered by red
sheets and with what looked like the softest mattress
ever.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; Lisa didn&#39;t even see Dominique, the taller
woman move so quickly, simply appearing as she slid
her arms around her from behind. Her skin was slightly
chill, but the tongue teasing the back of her neck
distracted her completely. &quot;Let&#39;s take all the
wrappings off,&quot; she purred into Lisa&#39;s ear, &quot;of my
lovely present.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Lisa gasped as the buttons on her red velvet
top were swiftly undone, the cloth dropping to the
floor to reveal her firm breasts. Delicately smooth
fingers traced her hot flesh, pinching gently at her
nipples.

&quot;You smell so good,&quot; Dominique turned Lisa around so
that they faced each other, her eyes growing heavy
with desire. They kissed, Dominique drawing her close,
their bodies grinding almost unconsciously together.

Lisa gasped as Dominique swiftly slid down the front
of her body, tongue stroking skin before kneeling in
front of the younger woman. Hands delicately pulled
the links of her chain belt free, pooling them before
setting them aside. Lisa blushed as her skirt was
tugged down, her thighs wet and her golden curls
already matted together.

&quot;Sweeter than the most delicate wine,&quot; Dominique
purred as she leaned forward to part those wet curls
with a single lap of her cool tongue.

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Lisa moaned, shuddering. The anticipation,
the teasing touches on the long ride here all had
taken their toll on her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she managed to
say, &quot;I&#39;m so close....&quot;

&quot;Let me drink,&quot; Dominique cooed, before her lips
closed around Lisa&#39;s hard clit, sucking on it
delicately but forcefully.

&quot;Ohhh,&quot; Lisa mewled, her legs nearly giving way.
Resting her weight on Dominique&#39;s surprisingly strong
shoulders she felt the first tremors of orgasm, then
with a throaty cry she came. She would have fallen but
for the strong hands grasping her, holding her close
to that hungry mouth.

Gently Dominique picked her up, cradling her in her
arms. &quot;Better than any wine,&quot; she purred as she walked
them towards the bed, &quot;so much more than I expected.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lisa murmured, &quot;I wanted to... you
first...&quot;

Dominique chuckled as she laid her down on the bed,
looking down at Lisa hungrily. &quot;You&#39;ll have time
enough later,&quot; she purred as she gracefully slid the
black dress off her body, revealing a slim but sexy
body with upthrust nipples and equally wet thighs. She
climbed onto the bed, eyes twinkling dangerously,
&quot;I&#39;ve barely started with you, yet.&quot;

Lisa met those eyes and saw a need in them, one deeper
than any she had ever known. Oddly it didn&#39;t frighten
her, instead a matching hunger seemed to rise up in
herself as she purred, &quot;Then I&#39;m yours, to do with as
you wish.&quot;

Dominique chuckled softly, &quot;Tell me, have you ever
been... bound?&quot;

&#39;What have I gotten myself into?&#39; Lisa thought
delightedly, raising her hands together in a
submissive posture. &quot;No,&quot; she answered breathlessly,
&quot;but I&#39;m willing to try.&quot;

***************

Dominique closed the bedroom door shortly before
morning, padding out into the hallway nude. She walked
to the parlor and sat down with a happy sigh, noting
the goblet was waiting for her as usual. Taking it she
drank the thick red fluid down, licking a last bit of
blood from her lips when she was finally done.

The brown haired woman was more generously
proportioned than Dominique, her eyes compassionate as
she walked over to where her friend sat. &quot;Natasha
tells me you brought another kitten home,&quot; she said
quietly.

&quot;Nocturne,&quot; Dominique nodded to her friend, entirely
unconcerned over her nudity. She smiled thoughtfully,
&quot;I don&#39;t know about her being a kitten, but I
certainly enjoyed the cream.&quot;

The other woman chuckled softly at that. &quot;So, are you
going to keep this one?&quot; Nocturne asked her
thoughtfully.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Dominique admitted, running her tongue
over her teeth. She smiled fondly in memory, &quot;I&#39;m
impressed, she didn&#39;t even use her safeword once.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully you didn&#39;t break out the whips and
paddles,&quot; Nocturne commented dryly.

Dominique smirked, &quot;No, I save that for the paying
customers.&quot; She rose from her chair with a contented
sigh, &quot;I wonder if we should bring you a tasty little
tidbit home?&quot;

Nocturne blushed faintly but admitted, &quot;I&#39;d like
that.&quot;

End

Author&#39;s Note: This one-shot ties in with the series
Descent, which features Lisa and Dominique. This story
covers their first encounter, more or less, along with
laying the groundwork for the later episode. I may or
may not expand on their sexual encounter, it depends
on how graphic I want to get. As I&#39;ve never actually
explained what Dominique does for a living, I decided
to hint at it here.</pre>
