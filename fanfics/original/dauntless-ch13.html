<p>“Wild Thing: going feral on Amazonia!”</p>
<p>The Ozmund Company was  revered as the galaxy’s most reliable public transport service, even  though it was a relative newcomer in the history of space exploration.  The United Cosmic Military was one of its most frequent clients and  sponsors, and most of the species recognized by the Alliance held the  Company in high regard. Even the elf races and the Elshyrin respected  Ozmund and trusted them to transport, protect, and escort everything  from high-level officials to everyday supplies. Although they did not  monopolize all space transports yet, Ozmund’s competition was so  incidental that they were either looked upon as jokes, fools, or  stubborn outlaws who had not yet been engulfed. Even with all their  accolades, awards, and good reviews, though, the Ozmund Company  remained quite humble about their work. Only those select few small  business owners saw them as an “evil” company; the rest of the galaxy’s  population eased into their speedy, punctual, and safe arms like  children snuggling beneath warm blankets in the winter.</p>
<p>The  heart, soul, and mind of the Ozmund Company was not credited to one  person but two: Keiko and Kyle Ozmund, a brother and sister team whose  hard work and exceptional business acumen had given rise to their quick  and widespread success. Kyle, the eldest, was the boss behind the  entire operation and the one who scouted the best pilots, mechanics,  and general maintenance crews who kept his business running; Keiko, his  twin sister, acted behind the scenes as a strategist, diplomat, and  chief advisor. While Kyle’s natural leadership qualities, strict  adherence to morals, and good public relations had built the company,  Keiko’s wisdom, foresight, and negotiation skills supported the  industry and made it what it was. What was most amazing was that the  twin siblings came from very humble origins, and yet had achieved all  this power just a few months shy of their thirtieth birthdays.</p>
<p>Right  now they were in the process of speaking to another potential client.  The man refused to reveal himself in person, instead choosing to  interact with them over a real-time voice feed. Occasionally, several  of the galaxy’s renowned powers would throw their lot in with the  Ozmunds and expand their empire by a few more planets, and this is what  their newest client was proposing. He was not so much interested in  broadening their horizons as he was strengthening their security, and  reminded them that with greater frontiers, their current protection  services were being stretched thin.</p>
<p>“It comes as no surprise to  hear of increased raids on smaller commercial vessels,” their client  spoke. His voice was musty and professional, completely devoid of the  slightest hint of interest or passion. “Studies show that criminal  organizations thrive in these wild or unknown regions some of your  other clients seem to favor. The United Military forces have performed  admirably in their duties thus far, but in their pride lies their  weakness; they cannot be all-encompassing. I will propose to lend  several of my employees to monitor the uncivilized regions of the  galaxy in order to cover up the gaps that the military misses. In  exchange, I will ask for a small margin of profits obtained from the  transports rendered safe by my actions. I will give you as much time as  you need to think it over. End transmission.”</p>
<p>It was true that  these so-called wild regions were unsafe, and any help in those areas  was greatly appreciated. Keiko and Kyle naturally paid their sponsors  back with their incredible profits, and had been hoping the military  would be more generous with enforcement. Lately, though, it seemed they  were stifled and short-handed, and even though the Ozmund Company was  expanding its territory to include worlds that were once previously  obscure and unknown, the UCM was hesitant to share in their bravery. A  great fortune could be had if there could only be the assurance of  safety in these regions—but Kyle and Keiko Ozmund never agreed to a  deal without thinking it over first.</p>
<p>“So—ideas?” asked the brother. Keiko pursed her lips, carefully staring at their client’s message.</p>
<p>“I  would like to speak with the military once more. If need be, I will  arrange a meeting with the Director herself. I would like to find out  why they’re so apprehensive.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. He didn’t sound like he was  up to no good—that guy played things real cool and careful. And it was  pretty slick of him talking to us over a computer. You think he knows  about my ‘special ability’?”</p>
<p>“Unlikely,” she chortled. “If he did, he wouldn’t have contacted us.”</p>
<p>“Oh  yeah. So while you’re busy playing with the army brats, what do you  think I should be doing? I was gonna send a crew to scout the new  territory and see what we’re up against, but if you have any ideas…”</p>
<p>“No, that sounds great. It looks like we have something to keep us busy now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  no kidding.” They shook hands and set off on their new paths. More than  likely, this would end up being nothing but politics on one end and  mindless pirates on the other, but if the course of a river can be  diverted by a single rock, there was no telling what might be in store  for them.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>Because of the damage caused by flying through a ring of asteroids twice, the <em>Dauntless</em> had no choice but to stop somewhere for external repairs. The Sek  system didn’t have a single decent maintenance hanger to speak of, and  the next closest was in a star system tightly controlled by the  military. This would not normally pose a problem but for the number of  outlaws, criminals, and rogues onboard. Kay and Tee had to move  elsewhere for repairs, even though they knew that a system not under  the watch of the military was probably a lawless, dangerous place to be  in (then again, they had plenty of lawless, dangerous women there for  protection!). Those with a knack for repairs chipped in while the  others wandered out, gathering supplies and stretching their legs.  Rebecca wanted to get started on the ship’s weapons, but Amy startled  her by saying the <em>Dauntless</em> did not possess any offensive capabilities at all.</p>
<p>“You mean to say that you don’t even have one little cannon for defense?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all.”</p>
<p>“So what do you do if some scumbag decides to chase you down?”</p>
<p>“There  are other ways out of a tight spot,” she answered with a smile. Rebecca  figured she was referring to her genie friend, who was eagerly acting  as a gofer for the mechanics. She looked up as the exotic creature  floated in the air, trying to smooth out all the dents and scratches.</p>
<p>“I guess so. How’d you two meet, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I already told you, didn’t I? We found each other.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean like Aladdin and his genie?”</p>
<p>“Something  like that.” Amy held up her right hand, which was bare except for a  large ring circling her middle finger. The stone was made out of a  material Rebecca didn’t recognize, and there were characters carved  into it she couldn’t decipher. “I inherited the <em>Dauntless</em> from  my parents, who received it from their parents. Before that, the  ship…well, it found them. It simply arrived before them one day and  swore to serve them. I know that makes no sense, but that’s what they  told me. They certainly didn’t buy it or build it. When I attained  ownership, my parents told me where to find…a certain item. It was  hidden somewhere on the silent planet—I mean, on Earth. That item was  the ring of Solomon, which he used to seal and bind the ifrits. By the  time I discovered it, of course, most of the ifrits were gone, and  Rachel was the only one left. We bound our destinies together and wound  up on Strategos.” Rebecca just stood there in a daze.</p>
<p>“It’s over my head,” she sighed. Amy chuckled sweetly.</p>
<p>“It  was a little big for me too. I’m still trying to wrap my mind around  it, so don’t feel like you’re the only one. Rachel and the <em>Dauntless</em> are the only defenses I’ll need in this life, and my soul is prepared for what lies beyond that.” Rebecca nodded.</p>
<p>“I  heard you were religious; I just never thought a Christian would be so  open about all these…uh, questionable people. And…I’ve noticed…quite a  lot have a fixation on…uh…you know. Each other.”</p>
<p>“You mean  they’re lesbians,” she stated gently. Rebecca sighed and nodded her  head. “It’s not my place to say anything about it. The only life I’m  responsible for is my own. I just have to love them unconditionally.  Say, I’d like to go for a walk. Care to join me?”</p>
<p>“Ah…are you  sure you should be doing that?” She knew about Miracle’s handicap, but  lately she had noticed the mousy young woman favoring her crutches over  the cane she usually kept. Amy almost looked offended as she took her  glasses off and polished them.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a tiny little cut on my foot that doesn’t heal, Rebecca—I’m not crippled. Come on, let’s go. Hey, Rachel!”</p>
<p>“Yo!”  The genie whirled around, almost dropping the stack of tools she was  ferrying around. She dove down to catch them and giggled nervously.</p>
<p>“Rebecca and I are going for a walk. Could you watch over the ship until it’s repaired?”</p>
<p>“Sure! I’ll call you as soon as it’s done.”</p>
<p>“Great,  thanks! Well Miss Hill, we have the day to ourselves. What would you  like to do? We won’t get another rest like this for quite some time.”  To be honest, Rebecca was getting hungry, but her mind was still on the  ship and the people imprisoned to its construction. She suggested that  they go out and pick up something for the whole crew, and Amy  brightened to the idea and led the way, wincing ever so slightly as her  foot brushed against the ground.</p>
<p>With the surprise treat boosting their spirits, the mechanics finished their work on the <em>Dauntless</em> in record time, but part of the credit had to be given to the ship  itself. Its alien designers obviously knew that it would be banged  around a lot, and gave it measures to recover itself. Nobody had ever  heard of self-regenerating armor before, but several women were already  attracted to the idea and a few tried replicating the process long  before liftoff (at least, that’s what Valti and Kyrie <em>said</em> they’d be doing when they scrambled into Professor Brignor’s room).  Lillianne had been stealing glances at the Tome of Treasures while  everyone else was working, and came across an entry she just couldn’t  resist.</p>
<p>“The Medallion of Fate…” She sat up and studied the entry  more closely. “Now where have I heard that before? …Ah, yes, it was one  of the items my ancestors exchanged with the Amazonians. Let’s see…we  traded the Bones of Fortune for it once. What else? Eh…I can’t  remember. I know it was off-world when the planet was lost; I didn’t  think the Amazonians would still have it. I wonder if that little pixie  would mind if we investigated.”</p>
<p>Dr. Miracle was chatting with  Alala when Lillianne interrupted with her proposition. Amy listened  just long enough to understand her sales pitch, then resumed her  conversation. Lil wasn’t used to being brushed aside or “put on hold”,  but she wanted to find that medallion and so she could endure a little  impertinence. She hovered over the babbling duo until Alala jerked  around and shooed her away.</p>
<p>“What do you want? Amy already  listened to your hackneyed story and she’s not interested! We’re having  an intellectual discussion and we don’t need your childish rudeness  interfering!”</p>
<p>“Actually, Amazonia is fairly close,” Miracle  mentioned. “It wouldn’t hurt to at least have a look around.” Alala  sputtered as her friend drew herself in to Lillianne’s world, and the  exotic beauty from Mu grinned carnally. At first she only signed on  with these losers to be with Aseria, but she never expected they’d  actually be of any use to her!</p>
<p>“Ames, ya can’t be serious! Don’t  listen to her! Amazonia is full of barbaric femmi-Nazis! They cut their  boobs off and keep men as pets! They don’t even have schools,  just…stupid rites of passage that puts poor young girls through Hell!”</p>
<p>“Sounds  like my kind of place,” Lil said proudly. Amy managed to calm Alala  down, using the very techniques the cat-girl so proudly flaunted.</p>
<p>“Listen,  Alala, why do you hate people who jump to the wrong conclusion about  you? Is it because it’s true, or are they merely ignorant? Didn’t you  set out to prove everyone else wrong about your race? You’re thinking  in stereotypes just like the people you claim to hate.”</p>
<p>“No I’m  not! I took a class on planetary histories, the same as Riene! She’ll  agree with me! I wouldn’t call them barbaric unless I knew it for a  fact!”</p>
<p>“But have you been down there to look for yourself?”  Alala’s mouth hung open in shock. The good friend who understood and  respected her was suddenly turning on her.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to <em>convince</em> me to go there?”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying you should stop being hypocritical.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” she snorted, pouting adorably. “I’ll go down there and see for myself, but Yenae better not follow!”</p>
<p>“I think we should all go down there,” Lil said warily. “The Amazonians might not all be barbaric, but it’s a barbaric <em>place</em>. We’ll need strength in numbers if we want to survive.” Amy shook her head warily.</p>
<p>“I  can ask everybody, but there’s no guarantee they’ll come along.  Remember, it’s their choice whether to stay here or leave with you. I,  on the other hand, will…happily accompany you.” She grunted as she  stood to her feet, and reached out for her cane as she walked to the  door. Despite looking so ordinary, unassuming, and mousy, Amy Miracle  had a surprising fearlessness about her that stirred and inspired the  hearts of others. She merely announced where the ship was going and who  was coming along, but by leading through example, she alone convinced  the entire crew to accompany her.</p>
<p>“That woman sure has balls,”  Naja admitted as she looked at the PA. She leaned over to lash her  forked tongue over her lover’s ear, whispering coldly, “We’re leaving  now. Get dressed and follow me.”</p>
<p>Chandra moaned and sat up. “Aww, do we <em>have</em> to?”</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>Not  since the days of Mu have outsiders set foot on the feral world of  Amazonia. Its very first explorers bequeathed its name in honor of the  Greek and South American tribes of warrior-women; it was a proper title  for a civilization so primeval and fierce. Although the citizens of Mu  had been regarded as equals and allies by the Amazonian women, no other  culture has since earned their respect. The very last visitors  retreated in such panic that not even the bravest or most daring  adventurer will land there. Those unlucky enough to be stranded there  are killed, kept as prisoners and studs, or else integrated into the  matriarchal tribes. Despite all this, it’s a lush, vibrant, gorgeous  planet, blooming with vegetation and animal life not seen since ancient  times, when people worshipped the stars and did not fly to them.</p>
<p>Lillianne  seemed to know Amazonian history and custom fairly well, and claimed to  have visited the world once, during the last days of Mu. She described  the women as powerful, independent, proud goddesses, each one born and  bred into a separate territorial tribe. They spent their lives honing  their skills, hunting, cultivating the land, waging war on their  enemies, and making love to their sisters in arms. Yes, she said, the  women formed bonds that were not unlike marriage with each other, only  taking a man when it came time to bear children. Most of the male  population were considered outcasts and were hunted for sport, but the  strongest and most attractive were kept like pets for breeding  purposes; they led a relatively good life compared to the others.  Contrary to popular belief, very few of the Amazonians actually cut off  their breasts: they had developed bows that cooperated with their  curvaceous bodies, and the only ones who kept that practice were those  who chose it as homage to their ancestors.</p>
<p>“My people voyaged  here through crafts given to us by the gods; the Plateau of Far Reaches  was designated as their landing space. It’s a level plane in a cleared  area that’s large enough to keep a ship twice as large as our own.  Since I know their culture the best, I’m going to go out first, but I  might need Miss Latoli by my side in case their language has changed.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know the Amazonian speech,” she admitted fretfully.</p>
<p>“But  you are a philologist, right? Don’t worry, you’ll pick it up quickly.  The rest of you, stay here and wait for my signal. It goes without  saying, but you’ll probably have to dress for very warm weather, unless  they’re generous enough to lend you something.”</p>
<p>“Or we could just go naked,” Shana said. Chandra and a few others heartily agreed, even though Miss Suing had not been serious.</p>
<p>“That would not be a wise idea. They may be savage, but they still have modesty. Riene, you ready?”</p>
<p>“This  is a little sudden,” she muttered, kneading her hands together  nervously. Lil placed a firm hand on her shoulder and gave her a fairly  encouraging look.</p>
<p>“You’ll just have to suck it up. I’d rather it  be Aseria by my side, but there’s no telling how they’ll react to a  woman with pointed ears and black skin. Come on—and get undressed.”</p>
<p>“Do  I have to?” she murmured fearfully. Lillianne was already brazenly  taking off her clothes and gave Riene an expectant look. The crew had  been whisked away so they could have their privacy, and seeing as how  she had already volunteered for this job, Riene complied. Lil’s mouth  jerked and her teeth were bared in a smile as the woman revealed  herself. Somehow, it was always the shyest women who managed to look  the sexiest. Riene’s beautiful reddish-orange hair and her freckled  skin made her look more enticing than most models Lillianne had known,  and if it weren’t for her twisted devotion to Aseria…well…</p>
<p>“Let’s  get moving,” she said, eyeing the redhead a bit longer. She made no  subtleties about it and so Riene knew exactly what was going through  the other woman’s mind.</p>
<p>The first thing they noticed, of course,  was the sweltering heat, and how it made their clothes stick to the  skin. Lillianne had nothing but a green toga on while Riene stood  fanning herself in a T-shirt and shorts. She was told to stand as  properly and proudly as she could so that the approaching envoy would  not look down on her. There were very few cowardly Amazonians in that  world and none of them led happy lives.</p>
<p>“Be bold,” she hissed,  “or they’re liable to rape you. Watch out for warning shots, too. Stand  perfectly still and don’t flinch. They won’t strike you, trust me. It’s  just a test of fortitude.” Riene took a deep breath to settle her  nerves. She had never been a particularly valiant woman and doubted she  could fake it, even with her life on the line.</p>
<p>“How long ago did you say you were here last?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t know,” she whispered. “It was several years. I was just a child,  but I—“ Her voice was stopped as eleven arrows sailed out of the sky,  striking the ground and bouncing off the ship’s hull. Riene was  petrified as she felt her heart race, but clenched her fists and  gnashed her teeth together. She just needed to pass this one trial…</p>
<p>“Ho!”  Lil shouted, raising her hand. She announced something in a fast  monosyllabic tone that was answered by three cries. In spite of her  earlier fear, Riene’s mind was working quickly and she could already  make out the beginnings of their speech. Three Amazon warriors  approached them during this time, covered in furs, feathers, bones,  war-paint, and rugged jewels. They set their weapons against the  intruders and appeared to demand their identities. Lil answered them  back in a firm voice; the women looked at each other, and slowly backed  off to speak with each other.</p>
<p>“I told them you’re my handmaiden,”  she murmured to Riene. “It was the only way I could justify your  existence. You’re not my family and you’re not my lover, so that was  the only option left. Anything else, and they’d take you into their  tribe and make sweet Amazonian love to you. I’m sorry if I disappointed  you,” she added sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Trust me, I’m grateful,” she whispered. “Did you tell them about the others?”</p>
<p>“Give  me a minute.” Riene could already identify parts of Lil’s speech as she  gestured to the ship, and the Amazons seemed to buy her story (which  was made easier due to the unanimous female population onboard). She  claimed to be the last Queen of Mu, which would account for her  “heavenly chariot”, and she had arrived with a bevy of handmaidens,  some of whom she openly promised to the eager warriors.</p>
<p>“You are  not to lay a hand on the one with blue hair and black skin, for she is  my mate, and we are bound by the red cord. There are others you may not  love as well, but I will identify which are suitable for your desires.  My handmaidens and I have traveled here from the Faraway Place; we  escaped from our world just before our gods saw fit to end its life. I  am here fulfilling my duties as Queen, and demand you return the  Medallion of Fate to me.”</p>
<p>“Hang on, they can’t just have their way with the crew!” Riene sputtered suddenly. Lil grinned at her.</p>
<p>“You  do learn fast. It’s standard Amazonian politics, Latoli, nothing more.  We’ll get them back once they’ve had their fun.” The Amazons were  huddled together in conversation in the meantime, debating whether or  not they would return the medallion to this “Queen”. She certainly came  from the Faraway Place, and opened her clothes to reveal the mark of  royalty, but they had possessed their treasure for a long time and did  not want to surrender it easily.</p>
<p>“We have conditions,” they said  to her. Riene could almost fully understand their language now and  followed along with little difficulty. “We ask three favors of you,  Queen Lillianne, in exchange for your prize. Not even you may have  something for nothing, so you must pay us with equal compensation.”</p>
<p>“Name your conditions.”</p>
<p>“First, you must hunt the saber-cat and lizard king, and bring us spoils of your victory.”</p>
<p>“I accept this.”</p>
<p>“Second,  one of you must shame the Queen of our enemies, the Maidens of the  Rippling Waters. You are free to do as you please, but you must leave  her alive.”</p>
<p>“I might just do that myself,” Lil grinned wickedly. “And the third?”</p>
<p>“You must find Nalia, daughter of Nervasse of the guard, and cure her of the disease that draws her to the men.”</p>
<p>“We  will be delighted to accompany you,” Lil swore. “And may I add once  again that a great number of my handmaidens will be available for all  your possible cravings.” She winked at Riene, who was too busy groaning  and nursing a new headache. She’d certainly have a lot of explaining to  do…</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>The Amazonians never expressed  quite the same reaction twice as each of the women disembarked, robed  in what they considered proper attire. Admittedly, most of them  received lustful or approving stares, especially Kate, whom the Amazons  welcomed with an awed silence. Not even their mightiest warrior could  compare to this astounding goddess sent down from the Far Places, who  in spite of her obvious strength, carried herself with caution and  humility. The Amazonians know no jealousy when they meet someone  stronger than them; there is instead a great joy and honor, and even  the proudest bow their heads. Kate’s face turned red and she didn’t  know whether to be flustered or flattered. Both Allegra and Sharyn  ribbed her playfully (the latter receiving gasps from the  warrior-women, who had never seen a girl with green skin).</p>
<p>“Is  this a living emerald or some beautiful frog that honors our tribe?”  they asked Lillianne. The “last Queen of Mu” had planned ahead for  these questions and answered smoothly.</p>
<p>“She is the bodyguard for  most of my handmaidens. She is from a world far from mine, and was  attracted to my side by my beauty and strength.”</p>
<p>“It is good,”  they said as they fawned over Sharyn. Chandra was, of course, having  the time of her life, while Alala was in her own personal hell. Even  though most of the Amazonians revere the great, wild cats and paid  homage to the “intelligent snow-tiger who walks upright”, Alala feared  that at any moment, she would be cornered and suffocated by their  devotion. Aseria and Lyara were also victims of their own celebrity,  even though one was seen as a curse on the world. Apparently her  obsidian skin was an omen of doom.</p>
<p>“She is the Queen’s lover, so  we shall let the accursed devil live,” the Amazons spoke to themselves.  Lil admonished them harshly while Aseria suffered ignorance; Lyara was  almost crimson from head to toe as the desires and hungers of the  Amazons washed over her. She was nearly overcome with lust herself and  staggered on her feet, creating quite a spectacle. Lillianne almost  doomed her by identifying the blue-haired maiden as an oracle of love,  but Riene saved her and helped her up.</p>
<p>“She has had too much to  drink. My dear friend was so anxious to be here that she became  intoxicated to dull the excitement. She must rest somewhere in private.”</p>
<p>“What did you say to them?” Lyara mumbled.</p>
<p>“I told them you shouldn’t try and gauge their emotions without feeling the consequences.”</p>
<p>“Screw you. So what’d you really tell them?”</p>
<p>“That you were drunk. I’m afraid our dear Queen was about to whore you.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t have a…oh crap, she didn’t! She couldn’t have sunk that low!”</p>
<p>“Her  Majesty Miss Markus is very manipulative…but it might have saved us in  the long run.” Lyara groaned and tried to restrain her powers as the  Amazonians guided them to their enclave; others filed suit and received  very different reactions. Kay and Tee were thought to be either a  monster or a two-headed goddess, Vimmy was labeled a goblin (to Naja’s  delight), Kyrie was almost killed for her resemblance to Amazonian  demons, Valti and Naja were worshipped on the spot, and if it weren’t  for Athena’s sword, she and Fuuka would’ve been hunted as animals.</p>
<p>“Are these handmaidens, or a menagerie?” grunted the Amazonians. Lil laughed nervously as she ran out of explanations.</p>
<p>“Oh—well—there  are wonders in this life that give rise to intelligent beasts and call  the gods to take human form. Her Royal Majesty has seen many of these  in her travels.”</p>
<p>“So it seems she has. But that one woman, the  one who limps…she will be a burden. Our shaman will attempt to cure her  for your sake, Queen Lillianne, but if she’s incapable, we must cast  her out until she heals.”</p>
<p>“Be mindful of her,” Lil warned; “she is protected by a higher spirit. No shaman will be able to remove it.”</p>
<p>“We have ways of warding off the strongest spirits.”</p>
<p>“I  would like to see them work.” She smiled faintly but still had her  doubts. She didn’t care one whit for Dr. Miracle, but that genie… She  could be a great help or a great trouble. Lillianne and Aseria led the  procession with the three Amazonians guiding them to their village.  They obviously did not trust this secret to their guests, for even  though they were not blindfolded, the group wound through long trails,  traveled over hills and under arches, waded through streams and passed  over bridges—basically taking the long way around. There was little  time to admire the astonishing beauty of the world since even Lillianne  and the “goddesses” were expected to keep marching. More than once, the  barbarians considered leaving Amy behind, but her friends and her genie  stood up for her and made sure she was always included. Everyone was  becoming hot and stuffy before long, but the Amazonians led them  through a rushing waterfall, which was more refreshing than a lover’s  kiss. It led into a long, straight passage that cut through the  mountain and ended up, at last, at their destination.</p>
<p>The village  was a broad, closed-off neighborhood of brick huts, farms, training  grounds, a river, and kennels where the men were kept. Unlike the  women, the males roamed around naked, and did not speak to their  masters or to each other, unless they were asked to. They were fed well  twice a day and were given a primitive dormitory to sleep in when the  weather was bad, and kept themselves busy by laboring in the fields and  performing menial chores. None of the women were shy about their  affection for each other, and more than once, the crew could hear  banging and groaning coming from one of the huts as another couple  whiled away the time expressing their devotions.</p>
<p>“This place rocks!” Chandra exclaimed. Valti and Kyrie sharply disagreed.</p>
<p>“I think it sucks. A lack of technology I can deal with, but a lack of science? They worship animals, for crying out loud!”</p>
<p>“I’m  not complaining,” Naja chuckled. She raised an eyebrow as three  drop-dead gorgeous young women walked by, all of them staring back with  eyes glimmering. “I just might retire to this place.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, not  me, there’s no sense of economy here, it’s all work and no business,  although I’m sure they trade in things like flint and bone, or  maybe…good gracious, do you think they exchange <em>each</em> <em>other</em>,  I mean would they trade girls for other girls, or men, or…I don’t even  want to think about it, let’s get out of here Mink, this medallion Lil  wants isn’t worth the trouble.”</p>
<p>“I agree. Miss Markus, may we wait on the ship?”</p>
<p>“Vimmy  can go by herself,” she waved dismissively, “but I’ll need you here  with me, Mink. I’ve given you the task of being Aseria’s personal  handmaiden.”</p>
<p>“But I only serve master Vimmy.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we’re  together now, there’s really no dividing us, let’s leave my dear, it’s  no place for us, although I’m sure YOU think it’s pretty, it does look  like Joff a bit, but the clientele is so awful, there’s not a profit to  be had—“</p>
<p>“So leave,” Lil sighed. Vimmy was starting to become  unbearable, and if she really wanted to run off so badly, so be it. “I  just hope you two don’t get lost along the way.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to worry,” Mink assured them blankly. “I’m very skilled at directions. Shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Oh  yes, it’s about time, and it’s so warm here…” Vimmy continued rambling  long after she and Mink left the village. The Amazonians were sad to  see the gray-skinned quiet girl leave (most of them naturally wanted to  have sex with her), but she was not their prisoner or their subject,  and the Queen had given her permission. As soon as everyone got settled  in, Lil explained the conditions they would have to honor in order to  obtain the Medallion of Fate, but with each task she described, more  and more women were discouraged. Hunting was one thing, but humiliating  a Queen they had no conflict with and steering a total stranger away  from her deviant desires sounded just awful. In the end, only Chandra,  Naja, and Aseria were left to accompany the self-proclaimed Queen, and  Aseria only followed her out of a strange obligation and an unfamiliar  love. Allegra sighed and loaded her guns.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel right  about huntin’ animals, but if it’ll get us off this world faster, I may  as well commit myself. But that’s as far as I’ll go.”</p>
<p>“Herut and  I are going back to the ship,” Shana said. “We’ll probably just get in  the way, and…I’m not comfortable with all these horny women around! If  anybody else wants to come with us…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, can’t hear you: I’m  too busy being pampered and worshipped!” Valti crowed. Kyrie was more  than happy to leave and the Amazonians were more than happy to expel  her from their homes. She was still a demon in their eyes, and out of  sight, out of mind. The Acheron twins abandoned the village since they  didn’t see a point in staying behind, and Eve went with them, since she  was uncomfortable in large crowds. Riene only stayed behind because she  didn’t trust Lillianne to translate the Amazonians accurately, Lyara  stuck behind after being encouraged by her friends, and Alala stayed to  protect Amy. The hunt would commence in the morning; Naja was already  headed to the rival tribe, with a giddy Queen Lil and her accursed  Aseria guided by two Amazonians; Chandra was on the lookout for Nalia,  who she believed she could easily seduce and thus cure her of her  bizarre heterosexuality. They were all, in short, kept quite busy.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>The  heavens as seen from the surface of Amazonia were nothing but stars and  galaxies and great bodies put into motion by a celestial orchestrator,  all lost in the everlasting blackness that engulfed the tiny little  world like a massive blanket. Amazonia as seen from the void of space,  however, was a magnificent, huge marble, glowing blue and green with a  corona of shimmering golden-white light rippling around it as it  circled around its sun. It was beautiful, yes, but not remarkable,  unless you were looking for the Medallion of Fate as well. Two  adventurers had learned of this remarkable artifact after long hours of  study and a bit of persistence, and being the adventurous type, they  each made way to this primitive world, though they did not cooperate  nor did they even realize they had competition.</p>
<p>“I wonder who  owns that colorful little rock,” Breathless muttered to herself. “Looks  like it’s inhabited. I guess I’ll just have to take the medallion by  force, if it’s even worth it.”</p>
<p>“Pretty,” the Jackal cooed as she caressed the image on her monitor. “It’s high time I take fate in my own hands…”</p>
<p>They had no idea what they were in for!</p>
