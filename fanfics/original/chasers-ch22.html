<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>        Beth looked up from her computer station, her eyes widening 
slightly as she saw Gwen stride inside. The normally cool, composed 
Asian woman was visibly angry, looking like she was ready to bite 
someone&#39;s head right off.

        Taking her life into her hands Beth stood up and tentatively 
asked, &quot;Anything I can do?&quot;

        &quot;Staff meeting,&quot; Gwen scowled, &quot;in five minutes.&quot; With that, she 
walked into her office and slammed the door behind her.

        &quot;This is not good,&quot; Beth sighed to herself softly. The little 
redhead got up from her seat, making her way down the hall to Kate&#39;s 
cubicle. She tapped on the side, getting the attention of the brown 
haired woman sitting in there.

        &quot;Yeah?&quot; Kate looked up with a slight frown.

        &quot;We have a meeting in five minutes,&quot; Beth smiled wryly, &quot;and 
from the mood Gwen is in, I wouldn&#39;t risk being late.&quot;

        &quot;Must be trouble from the brass,&quot; Jen came up the hallway to say 
quietly. She gave Kate a look, and oddly the woman looked away 
awkwardly.

        &quot;Earlier I got a call from a contact that I trust,&quot; Kate said 
thoughtfully, &quot;who said that there&#39;s trouble in Lowtown.&quot; She got up 
from her chair as they moved on to the meeting room, &quot;Do you think it 
might be related?&quot;

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t be surprised,&quot; Beth said calmly.

        Gwen looked up from where she was sitting at the head of the 
table to order, &quot;Grab your seats, ladies. We&#39;ve got a lot to cover, and 
not a lot of time to do it in.&quot; More quietly, almost emotionlessly she 
explained, &quot;The city has decided that it&#39;s time to go out after the 
Freewills, and it looks like we&#39;ll be the ones on the point.&quot;

        There was an odd moment of silence in the room as they digested 
that. Gwen studied their reactions, just a bit surprised to see Kate, of 
all people, frowning at the idea. Beth looked thoughtful, and Jen was 
waiting for more information before she made her decision.

        &quot;On what legal grounds are we supposed to bring the Freewills 
in?&quot; Jen finally had to ask her tentatively.

        Gwen&#39;s mouth twitched slightly, &quot;The manufacturers claim that 
all the Freewills are merely pieces of errant property, and can be 
reclaimed on those grounds.&quot; She met their eyes, &quot;We&#39;ll be working with 
the other departments to carry this out, but we&#39;re the ones with the 
actual field experience. They&#39;ll be following our lead.&quot;

        &quot;And if we don&#39;t choose to provide this lead?&quot; Beth murmured 
softly.

        &quot;We have our orders,&quot; Gwen reminded them, &quot;from the Mayor on 
down.&quot;

        Kate laughed to herself softly, and it was not a particularly 
nice laugh at that. &quot;From what I remember just saying that I was only 
following orders,&quot; she said dryly, &quot;didn&#39;t particularly help out the 
Germans very much.&quot;

        Jen and Beth clearly didn&#39;t get the historical reference, but 
Gwen had to smile to herself slightly. &quot;This is not a simple situation, 
and I don&#39;t want any of you going against your conscience,&quot; she finally 
said seriously, &quot;please take the rest of the day off, think about all of 
this, and then let me know tomorrow morning if you can do this.&quot;

        &quot;And if something comes up?&quot; Jen asked, looking a bit surprised 
that Gwen was sending them all home so early.

        &quot;You can all leave your pagers on,&quot; Gwen smiled at them a bit 
grimly, &quot;but I&#39;m not calling you in. If I get into trouble, so be it.&quot;

        &quot;Got it,&quot; Kate nodded. She waited until Beth and Jen left before 
quietly asking, &quot;Are we supposed to keep quiet about all of this?&quot;

        Gwen spoke quite innocently, &quot;I wasn&#39;t instructed not to.&quot;

        Kate nodded crisply, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

        Gwen watched her go, then reached across her desk to pick up her 
phone, dialing smoothly. &quot;Alexis,&quot; she smiled grimly, &quot;I really need to 
see you.&quot;

        The blonde haired psychiatrist looked at her image, frowning 
slightly. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Alexis asked worriedly.

        Gwen smiled slightly, once again oddly reassured by how easily 
Alexis could still read her. &quot;Lunch,&quot; she said softly, &quot;and I&#39;ll tell 
you.&quot;

        &quot;Meet you there?&quot; Alexis didn&#39;t ask any dumb questions, grabbing 
at her jacket.

        &quot;See you in a bit,&quot; Gwen sighed.

        The parking garage and maintenance bays were quiet as the three 
officers made their way to their vehicles. &quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Beth 
asked quietly.

        &quot;I&#39;ve got a friend to see in Lowtown,&quot; Kate said seriously. She 
opened up her car door and hesitated a moment, &quot;Can I give you a ride 
home, Jen?&quot;

        Jen was silent for a few seconds, then quietly answered, &quot;Sure, 
I&#39;d like that.&quot;

        Beth gave both of them an airy wave, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;

        Kate slid behind her seat, resting her hands of the wheel. Jen 
climbed into the passenger seat and looked over the cruiser, &quot;I still 
can&#39;t believe that you lobotomized this poor thing.&quot;

        A slight smile teased at Kate&#39;s lips, &quot;What can I say, I just 
hate chirpy computer voices.&quot; The engine hummed to itself sweetly as she 
slid the unmarked patrol car into the flow of traffic, handling the 
vehicle with her usual style.

        &quot;Gwen sounded pretty grim,&quot; Jen offered into the quiet of the 
car&#39;s compartment.

        &quot;She&#39;s got reason to be,&quot; Kate scowled, &quot;there&#39;s no way most of 
the Freewills are going to be coming in quietly. It&#39;s going to be one 
gigantic mess.&quot; She flexed her fingers on the controls, quite 
deliberately looking away from Jen, &quot;I wanted to say I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

        Jen was pretty startled, she hadn&#39;t really been expecting that. 
She was tempted to push Kate a bit, but decided not too. &quot;Apology 
accepted,&quot; she said quietly.

        Kate smiled wryly, &quot;You&#39;re letting me off easy.&quot; She puffed out 
a short breath, &quot;I was pretty harsh, and I wish I had put things a bit 
better.&quot;

        A slight smile twisted Jen&#39;s lips, &quot;But you still don&#39;t date 
other cops.&quot;

        Kate sighed softly as they pulled up to Jen&#39;s apartment 
building. She got out, walking around the car to open up the startled 
blonde&#39;s door. &quot;I dated an fellow officer once,&quot; Kate admitted to her 
softly, &quot;it didn&#39;t end well.&quot;

        Jen let Kate walk her to the front doors, &quot;I understand.&quot; She 
gently put her hand on Kate&#39;s arm to keep her from heading back to her 
car, &quot;But our going out to dinner or something doesn&#39;t have to be a 
date, you know.&quot;

        &quot;You never give up, do you?&quot; Kate actually smiled down at her 
slightly. Jen looked up at her entreatingly, her blue eyes piercing, and 
Kate had to sigh softly, &quot;All right, we&#39;ll have dinner. But in a couple 
of days, please.&quot;

        Jen smiled happily but she kept her answer to a simple, &quot;All 
right.&quot; Kate returned to her car, and Jen gave her a little wave before 
going inside.

        Kate had to fight off a smile as she made her way out into 
traffic. She suspected that this dinner was a bad idea, but that had 
never really stopped her before now. Scanning the streets she found a 
lift, sliding the vehicle into the vehicle compartment. The keypad slid 
under her hand, and she tapped the code to bring her down to Lowtown.

        The lift fell gently, and as Kate descended the sunlight was 
gradually cut off by the gigantic buildings all around. As the light 
faded artificial lighting grew brighter, the architecture around her 
aging as they dropped well below the sunlight line. The poor lived here, 
the poor, the lost and those that didn&#39;t really want to be found.

        &#39;Like the Freewills,&#39; Kate thought grimly. There was a large 
population of those androids in Lowtown, and the police down there were 
mostly a skeleton force. The primary job of the regular police was to 
keep the criminals of Lowtown out of the upper levels, so that the rich 
didn&#39;t have to deal with them or their problems.

        A soft bump, and her cruiser reached the level she wanted. Even 
the unmarked stood out here, where vehicles of any sort were a rarity, 
too expensive for the people who dwelt there. Kate could feel 
speculative glances on her as she rolled down the street and thought, 
&#39;They probably figure I&#39;m slumming, looking for a good time.&#39;

        Kate pulled in to where Silver and her usually met, looking 
around her with a frown. The lady was usually early or right on time... 
A soft cry from one of the alleys got Kate&#39;s attention, then a familiar 
cry rang out.

        &quot;Silver,&quot; Kate bolted across to where she heard it coming from. 
The two figures were struggling there in the shadows, a man trying to 
pin Silver down.

        &quot;It&#39;s gonna be open season on all your kind pretty damn soon,&quot; 
he hissed out at her angrily, &quot;I&#39;m just getting mine back a bit early.&quot;

        Kate didn&#39;t say a word, just grabbed him by the collar and 
bodily yanked him off her. &quot;What do you think...&quot; she started to say, 
then stopped in surprise. A police officer, the jerk she had dealt with 
when she first ran into Silver.

        &quot;Let me go, you bitch,&quot; he howled, struggling in her iron grip.

        POW! Kate&#39;s fast punch rocked his head backward. He stood there 
dazed for a moment, then with barely a wobble he dropped to the pavement 
with a loud thud.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Silver smiled grimly, rubbing at her throat where he 
had grabbed her. She looked up at Kate, &quot;What did he mean, open season?&quot;

        Kate scowled down at the unconscious man, then looked up to meet 
Silver&#39;s eyes. &quot;We&#39;ve got to talk,&quot; she sighed, &quot;there&#39;s trouble 
coming.&quot;
