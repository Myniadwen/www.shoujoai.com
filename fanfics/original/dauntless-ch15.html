<p>“Showdown on Amazonia:  the race for Fate itself!”</p>
<p>             Fuuka Fujiwara, content to bring up the rear and keep a lookout for the  others, couldn’t help but notice how popular Sharyn was with everyone.   Nearly everybody onboard had been captivated by her exotic beauty,  poetic speech, and romantic chivalry—not to mention what a graceful  athletic body she had or her bipolar disposition of charming doubt and  magnetic pride.  Of course, Fuuka only had eyes for Athena, but she did  find it amusing that even though they were all on very serious business  and could be ambushed or even killed at any moment, Lyara and Rebecca  kept stealing glances.  Sharyn seemed to like just about everybody,  even Naja and Lil a bit, so it was difficult to tell where her fancies  were truly directed.</p>
<p>            Sheer tedium forced Fuuka to  observe things like this.  She was used to the quiet since Athena never  was much of a talker, but she had become so accustomed to the action  that followed their daily lives that all this sneaking around made her  feel lethargic.  They were after something called a lizard-king, which  made Sharyn’s day since she assumed it was a dragon (and thus came her  warrior’s pride), but even the thrill of the hunt seemed petty.   Watching Rebecca and Lyara discreetly make eyes at Sharyn while her  back was turned was much more amusing.</p>
<p>            Eventually,  Lyara stopped the group and had them hide in a thicket.  She couldn’t  sense the emotions of lower animals (like lizards), but she had long  pointed ears, a keen nose, and sharp eyes that could pick out a flea,  and if she said there was danger…  The earth shook as it heralded the  lizard king:  hearts started hammering, palms dampened, breathing  intensified, terror and joy built up in the guts, and hairs stood on  end.  What came slithering through the clearing was something much  larger than a common salamander or crocodile:  it heaved up the land  and broke down anything in its path, creating disaster in its wake.   Its mouth alone was large enough to swallow its smaller cousins whole,  and when it purred, raising its huge nostrils to smell prey, a shiver  ran down every spine there.</p>
<p>“Oh!  It looks like the dragon from <em>Escaflowne</em>,” Fuuka whispered.  Rebecca glanced over at her strangely and she blushed.  “Sorry.  That’s the otaku in me talking.”</p>
<p>“Otaku?”</p>
<p>“Dragon?!”  Sharyn squealed.  Before anybody could warn her, she was screaming and  flying through the air, presenting herself before the giant lizard as a  challenger.  “I hath never slain your like before, dragon!  Let all  Amazonia witness as Sharyn of New Avalon strikes thee—“</p>
<p>“Down!!”  Lyara screamed as she bowled the impetuous warrior over.  Teeth as hard  and sharp as stones on a seaside cliff lurched at her, narrowly grazing  Lyara.  “You fool, this is no time for pretty speeches!” she yelled.   Fuuka (and Rebecca) noticed how deeply the elf was blushing—she had  become quite intimate with Sharyn when she dove in to rescue her—and  couldn’t help but smile as they tore apart and circled around the  lizard, looking for an opening.  Rebecca immediately began opening  fire, burning through the beast’s scaly hide, while Fuuka took cover  and tried directing the fight.  Whenever Athena got in trouble, Fuuka  usually kept out of harm’s way and watched her back from a distance,  but on occasion, could hold her own.  She was much too frail to fight  now, though—but she was sure her services would be required later!</p>
<p>Meanwhile  the battle was going poorly.  All of these women were fine combatants  in their own right and they could each hold up well under trying  circumstances, and if they actually combined their unique styles of  fighting, the lizard-king would be beaten.  But Sharyn was still going  on about “slaying the dragon” (even though Fuuka was sure it was some  type of dinosaur), and Lyara and Rebecca were fighting for her  attention.  They tried outdoing each other too much and forgot about  the danger; they only wanted Sharyn to look their way, grin warmly, and  praise them for their efforts.</p>
<p>“Its eyes are its weak point!” Lyara screamed as she lashed a chain against its face.</p>
<p>“You gotta hit the neck and the throat!” Rebecca shouted as she fired her custom-made guns.</p>
<p>“I  shall not savor the day’s honor till’ I attempt a frontal assault!”  Sharyn cried, as she did just this (and nearly got mauled, poor dope).   Fuuka sighed wearily.</p>
<p>“Now it’s starting to look like a harem  anime.  I just hope Athena and the others are doing well.”  The  dinosaur finally gave up and collapsed after a few hairy minutes, but  its exhaustion did not stem from any wound.  It got so tired of  following the three insane women around that it simply fell down in a  tizzy.  Thankfully the competitive trio was capable of slaying a  stationary lizard, and Fuuka saw to it that they all delivered a  killing blow at the same time, just so nobody could brag over the  others.  Sharyn slumped down suddenly, whining softly in pain as she  clutched her arm.  A small trickle of blood was coming out and two  eager physicians rushed to help her.</p>
<p>“I can heal that pretty quickly,” Rebecca said.</p>
<p>“Oh,  I know how to make that better,” Lyara said.  They rammed into each  other in their blind eagerness and fell down, leaving Fuuka the  opportunity to finally do her job.</p>
<p>“Never trust an amateur to do a professional’s job.  Is that any better, Lady Sharyn?”</p>
<p>“Aye, I thank thee.”</p>
<p>“You’re  quite welcome.”  They smiled at each other and Sharyn blushed humbly;  her face turned a cute dark green.  Rebecca and Lyara groaned.</p>
<p>“This sucks.  My chance to impress her is ruined.”</p>
<p>“And  I wanted to show off my medical skills to Sharyn.”  They glared at each  other only for a moment, but their anger subsided as they noticed just  how beautiful the other woman was.  Fuuka noticed as well!</p>
<p>“You’ve  got to be kidding me.  Now the two rivals are interested in each  other?  I really should have just stayed behind with the others!”</p>
<p>“What are you muttering about?” said a recovered Rebecca.</p>
<p>“We’re dragging this thing away,” Lyara announced.  “If you won’t help, don’t expect us to do you any favors!”</p>
<p>“I’m coming,” Fuuka sighed.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             Mink and Eve faithfully followed Nalia as she picked up the trail of  her adversary and sprinted through the forest in maniacal pursuit.   They were both reasonably in shape and managed to keep up, though Nalia  was hopelessly swift and almost forgot she had allies by her side as  she vaulted through the jungle like a gymnast.  She forced herself to  stop and wait several times as the others gingerly picked their way  through the overgrowth, wincing sheepishly whenever they caught up.   Shana Suing was in no condition to rival their determination and lagged  so far behind that ultimately, she decided to just quit and leave the  rest to them.  She turned around and went back, remembering the path  perfectly, but soon found herself facing somebody very familiar.</p>
<p>            “Shana!”</p>
<p>“Jeez!  Herut, you scared me!  How’d you get all the way out here?”</p>
<p>“I  followed you,” she answered.  “I got back to the ship fine enough, but  then I noticed that tramp was hanging around me.  I got out of there as  quickly as possible and managed to find you walking by.”</p>
<p>“You  must really hate her,” she giggled.  “I was actually about to go back  myself…but I guess now it’s a bad idea.  I mean, I don’t wanna leave  you here and you don’t have anywhere else to go.”</p>
<p>“That would be very kind of you,” she replied, smiling peacefully.  “So where are you headed?”</p>
<p>“Oh!  This really cool Amazon who likes boys came by and fought off Chandra’s advances!  I never saw anybody do that before!”</p>
<p>“I like her already,” Herut chuckled.  “So is this a friend, or…”</p>
<p>“She  says the medallion we’re all after was stolen, and she wants to get it  back.  She’s really awesome, Herut.  I wish we had someone like her  with us.”</p>
<p>“She’d be a fish out of water, Shana.  Well, since we came all this way, we may as well finish the job.  Which way did they go?”</p>
<p>“Over  here,” Shana said as she ambled through the forest.  Part of her  complained about having to plow through this wild region again,  inevitably finding themselves lost, searching for friends who were  probably a kilometer away by now—but the other part was glad Herut was  keeping her company.  She was so close to Shana’s age and height (both  girls were surprisingly petite) that the two had formed a friendship  even though they hardly had anything else in common.</p>
<p>That, and they held hands as they went in search of their wayward companions…</p>
<p>“I  thought we lost you,” Eve said as Shana and Herut finally rejoined  them.  The two younger women were hot, sweaty, and worn out, but they  made the smallest spectacle as Lil and Aseria had found them as well,  and pulled Nalia aside to have a few words with her.</p>
<p>“What’s going on?” Shana gasped.</p>
<p>“We’re  all looking for the same person,” Mink answered.  “Miss Herut, has  Shana brought you up to speed?  I see.  We only recently ran into them;  Miss Markus is trying to reason with Miss Nalia.  It seems that in  order for her to regain her treasure, Nalia had to be successfully  seduced by another woman.”  Herut rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Normally this is the part where I’d say, ‘that explains why Chandra was there’, but…you know.”</p>
<p>“It  also seems that Miss Nalia has a much more level head than her  sisters,” Mink resumed.  “She does not believe Miss Markus is a Queen.”</p>
<p>“Nobody does, except those bimbos,” Eve muttered.</p>
<p>“She  will accept her help in finding the treasure, but after that, as you  humans say, all bets are off.  This is a most uneasy truce.  Miss Nalia  will not hand over the treasure, and we all know how forceful Miss  Markus can be, but right now, there is a common enemy.”</p>
<p>“Yikes,”  Shana cringed.  “I guess no matter what we do, somebody gets screwed in  the end.”  Mink nodded silently and stood aside as Lil marched ahead,  the negotiations complete.  Aseria was right behind her, and in spite  of her unswerving loyalty, she couldn’t help but mutter her  disapproval.  The search for the so-called bird-goddess was made easier  with Nalia leading the way and Shana mapping everything out in her  head.  Despite her cute face, small size, and zest for art, she  continued to prove more and more useful to the crew—not just as a  lock-pick or a wealth of stored information, but a cheerleader and  morale-booster.  Even Herut felt the cold steel around her  dispassionate heart begin to melt whenever she was around—and she was  so chaste too, unlike Chandra!  Herut was sure that loving Shana could  be the purest thing in the world, and being loved by her the most  wonderful.</p>
<p>It was easy hunting the thieving bird-goddess down,  but it was more difficult communicating.  Nalia understood Mink’s  domestic language and her own, but she had to rely on Lil to interpret  most of her thoughts, and when you’re racing through a thick jungle in  pursuit of a woman who can fly, it’s nearly impossible keeping things  together unless everyone understands each other.  Aseria spotted their  prey first as a splash of colorful feathers slipped through the  foliage, but by the time Nalia understood her, it was too late.</p>
<p>“Damn all of this!” grunted the elf as she took off.  “We don’t have to talk to kill the bitch!  Back me up, Lillianne!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  that’s my girl!” she cheered.  Aseria was usually a mild, civilized,  meek woman who kept her dangerous side restrained, only unleashing it  to turn the tables on her enemy.  But it seemed there was something  demonic inside her as she pulled out a dual-bladed scythe that glowed  red and white with hunger.  She chopped trees down like they were  stalks of wheat as she cleared a path in search of her enemy, and went  completely berserk as Breathless, that savage Avain who endangered  Lyara and the others in the Reverse Castle, soared up in the air and  mocked her.</p>
<p>“More little pixies to get in my way?  What is it with these pointy-eared freaks?  Go find your own treasure!”</p>
<p>“I’d  be careful if I were you,” Lil called out to her.  “Aseria may look  like a pussy, but she’s known in many circles as ‘the Brutal  Princess’.  She’s been holding back until now!”  Aseria threw her  scythe with impeccable aim; it licked the feathers off Breathless’s  back but her talons caught the weapon and threw it far away.  Aseria  merely grinned wickedly, whispering arcane Sindrin words as she raised  her hands to the sky.  The scythe whirled back around, obeying her  voice, and attacked Breathless again.  The feathered woman knocked the  weapon away again, foaming and raving madly, and was struck from behind  as the enchanted weapon caught her off guard.</p>
<p>Too proud to admit  defeat, Breathless careened through the air with her mouth and talons  wide open, ready to engulf her foes.  She was even faster than the  scythe, and before Aseria could react, her deadly talons ripped open  cloth and flesh; she laughed for joy as she flew back into the air,  preparing to attack again.  Lil gnashed her teeth in rage and clenched  her hands so hard that her nails drew blood.</p>
<p>“Now you’ve done it,” she snarled.  “I’m gonna roast you and eat you alive, you fucking pheasant.”</p>
<p>“She’ll  live,” Nalia sighed as she bent down to check the wounds.  She wasn’t  as good a healer as Fuuka, but made do and patched the elf up nicely.   Lillianne was too absorbed in revenge fantasies to pay them any mind;  she was already daring Breathless to “try that again”.  Now one must  not get the wrong impression about this woman, or the Avian-people in  general.  They are as diverse and eclectic as any other intelligent  species, and when you get down to it, even Breathless herself passed as  a somewhat decent creature.  She merely craved treasures and riches and  material possessions; her only real sins were insatiable greed and  unstoppable wrath.  She never fought unless she was attacked first, so  in a way, her experience with the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> had been a series of tragic misunderstandings.</p>
<p>But  who cares, right?  She and Lillianne fought like starving dogs as she  swooped in and smashed her foe.  Lil absorbed the brunt of the attack  and clung on tight, wrestling Breathless to the ground.  She was far  stronger than her enemy and was quickly making use of her fists, feet,  and teeth, digging deep bruises and scars until Breathless blinded her  with her plumage and flapped away.  In the air, she was unbeatable, but  on the ground, she lost every time.  The two could not fight each other  until a “compromise” was made:  Breathless would have to dive down and  dig her claws in deep before Lil could counter with a few bloody  blows.  Eventually a draw was called and Breathless retreated, but not  before Nalia decided to step in and finish the job.  She found a flat,  circular stone and threw it like a discus, striking Breathless so hard  that she dropped the stolen medallion.</p>
<p>“Catch it!”  Nalia and  Aseria raced as it drifted in the air; its fate would be decided by  whoever took hold of it first.  Before either of them could reach it,  the ground underneath them erupted, spewing leaves, grass, and dirt  everywhere.  A hand shot out of the confusion and snagged the treasure  before either woman could touch it, and drew back to clutch  victoriously.  There was a sliver of free time in that moment where  everybody was suspended in astonishment, and for those lagging behind,  still catching their breath from the fight, they could see that another  rival had hidden herself in the grass this whole time, waiting for  them, and now sprang out like a spider to grab her prize.  Nalia and  Aseria were disposed of as the woman blew tranquilizer darts at them,  taking advantage of the surprise.  But words are slow:  all this  happened in a few merciless seconds, and by the time most of the women  knew what was going on, the Jackal had her prize.</p>
<p>            “It  was a pain waiting all that time, but definitely worth it.  This’ll  keep me in good spirits for awhile.  Eve—take care, beautiful!”  She  blew the staggering woman a sultry kiss and hopped away; Shana grinned  as she noticed just how red her friend’s face was.</p>
<p>“Ooooooooh!”  Eve snorted and swatted at her.</p>
<p>“What  are you looking at?!”  Meanwhile, Lil screamed at the Jackal as she ran  off, but by that time, she was the only one who even cared.</p>
<p>            “Gods damn it, she took my jewel!  What the hell’re you all standing around for?  Help me get it back!”</p>
<p>            “Get it back yourself,” Eve mumbled as she went to check on Aseria and Nalia.</p>
<p>            “Are they okay?” Shana said to Mink.  The quiet woman checked their pulses methodically and nodded.</p>
<p>            “Just asleep.  These are knockout darts.  I think it would be best if somebody stays behind and takes care of them.”</p>
<p>             “Aseria, yes,” Lil insisted, “but you can forget about that Amazon  bitch.  She wanted to steal my treasure and keep it for herself!”</p>
<p>             “Nobody cares,” Eve grunted.  She loaded her sniper’s rifle and went  off in the direction Jackal had gone, though she didn’t seem too  fanatical about the treasure.  “Don’t get the wrong idea now, your  royal pain-in-the-ass-ness,” she pointed to Lil.  “I just wanna set a  few things straight with that woman.  You all stay here with the  sleeping beauties.”</p>
<p>            “What about her?” Herut said, pointing to Breathless.  Eve shrugged.</p>
<p>            “Feel sorry for her, I guess.  Later.”</p>
<p>            “Eve!”</p>
<p>            “I know,” she waved.  “I’m all business now.  There’ll be time to sort out my fucked-up feelings later.”</p>
<p>             The Jackal had not counted on meeting so many rivals for this single  mysterious treasure, but the thrill of the hunt and the joy of  competition made her quest all the more memorable and appetizing.  Once  she felt she was secluded enough, she stopped to get a good look at the  little trinket everybody wanted.  The Medallion of Fate was quite a  breathtaking piece of jewelry, but far too large and heavy to actually  wear, except maybe on special occasions.  The chain was actually the  skeleton of a snake, its head acting as the center; its jaws had been  forced open so the jewel could be thrust in.  The bauble was the size  of a golf ball and glowed bluish-gold, and there were little gems in  the snake’s eyes and runes etched in fine lines along the bones.  It  was pretty to look at but not very practical; the Jackal wondered what  sort of price she could fetch for this.</p>
<p>            She heard a  shot and saw how the ground next to her foot was torn up a bit as the  bullet burrowed through it, and quickly turned around to smile at her  assassin.  The sniper sent another warning shot, this time blowing a  hole in a nearby tree, and revealed herself a minute later, an  impatient and cautious look on her face.  Eve tensely kept her distance  and loaded another round, but held her gun away.</p>
<p>            “You’re a good shot,” the Jackal said with a smile.</p>
<p>            “Sometimes.  What’s so important about that thing?”</p>
<p>             “As far as I know, absolutely nothing, except what I can pawn for it.   But you know the old saying:  ‘one man’s trash is another man’s  treasure.’  Apparently your friends back there saw something important  in this.”  Eve wanted to make a comment but decided to interrogate the  woman instead.  She didn’t follow her all the way out here just to  banter.</p>
<p>            “What’s your deal, anyway?  Who are you?  Are you just another treasure hunter, or what?”</p>
<p>             “Another treasure hunter?”  Jackal chortled and waved her hand.   “That’s putting it crudely, I think.  I’m just a wrench in the cogs,  beautiful.  I live life the way I want and I never let anybody stand in  my way.  I’m not evil, I’m not good; I’m not your friend, and I’m not  your enemy.  I live for the thrill of the chase and the prospect of new  adventures.  If you were hoping for some deeper meaning to all our  encounters…well, unless all that blushing and stuttering means what I  hope it does, you’re out of luck, sweetheart.”</p>
<p>            “I don’t know whether you’re serious or just messing with me,” Eve stated, fondling her gun discreetly.</p>
<p>            “Usually it’s the second one, but for you, my dear, I mean what I say.  Of course, that doesn’t mean you should <em>trust</em> me, but I wouldn’t mind if you <em>liked</em> me.  If you don’t, that’s fine as well, but it’ll sure break my heart  putting a sexy woman like you behind me.”  Eve turned red again and  lowered her gun, sighing deeply.</p>
<p>            “I honestly don’t  know what I think about that.  Nobody’s ever seriously come on to me  before.  I’m not in the habit of trusting people.”</p>
<p>            “That’s a good habit to keep; you’ll live longer.  But I can’t understand why people would stay away from you.”</p>
<p>             “Isn’t it obvious?” Eve whispered, casting her face aside.  She didn’t  notice how close the Jackal was walking until it was too late; by then,  the older woman had already ensnared her mouth and fulfilled the  promise she made in the pool not long ago.  Eve had been kissed before,  first by that prostitute and then by Chandra, but this felt so  different and unique that she nearly believed the reality of it all.   Chandra’s kisses had been nice and fiery, but they were also  superfluous and even empty after awhile, but the Jackal’s soft pink  lips had thrills and adventures and romance and human emotion backing  it up.  It felt so much like a real kiss that Eve forgot herself for a  moment and returned the favor—maybe because she really was falling for  this rogue, or maybe because she was so truly desperate for human  contact.</p>
<p>            “I hope we meet again soon,” she heard  someone say, and the warmth of the experience left her as the Jackal  disappeared.  Eve had been left shaking in her shoes, with nothing but  a memory imprinted into her heart for as long as she would live—and,  oddly enough, the Medallion of Fate, which the Jackal apparently gave  to her.  Pinned on one of the bones was a note that made Eve feel like  this strange relationship was really becoming serious.  It read:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>MY NAME IS QUINCY WINCHESTER</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>ONLY MY LOVERS KNOW THAT NAME</strong></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             Things were put into motion quickly.  Even though Nalia still remained  an outsider as far as the Amazonians were concerned, “Queen Lil” had  proven herself worthy of the treasure after all.  Nalia reluctantly  admitted how bravely the exotic woman and her dark lover fought against  the bird-goddess whole stole the breath of mortals away—it was a tale  that would surely be passed down for generations—and her sisters agreed  that if anyone was worthy of the medallion, it was Lillianne.  This did  not help alleviate the woman’s massive ego one little bit.  Now that  she had her treasure, it was decided that they would leave Amazonia  soon.  Most of the warriors were already grieving the loss of so many  admirable and beautiful women—but at least they still had Kate Shepherd.</p>
<p>             “You’re staying?!” Allegra blurted when she heard the news.  Kate  smiled warmly and nodded.  She had almost completely gone native by  that point and was wearing traditional Amazonian clothes.  They  certainly seemed to flatter her muscular frame more than her old outfit  did—now all she needed was a tattoo and a few jewels pierced in.</p>
<p>             “I was really just looking for a place where I could belong.  Amy did  say we could come and go as we pleased, so I’ve decided to live here.”</p>
<p>             “I’ll be jiggered,” she murmured—then, a great big southern belle smile  flourished on her face as she pumped her fist and exclaimed, “Well  shoot, why don’t I just stay here with you?  I ain’t got no ties to the  ship.”</p>
<p>            “Are you sure?”  Allegra winked confidently.</p>
<p>             “I did say I’d stay by your side no matter what, didn’t I?  Well, if I  didn’t, I’m sayin’ it now!  I guess I’ll just have to get used to  shootin’ a bow from now on!”  As Allegra laughed out loud, Kate  reconsidered her life-altering decision.  Her original goal was to  leave Utopia, get as far away from it as possible, and spend her days  in good company.  On Amazonia, she had a promising future, a group of  loyal and loving sisters, and was even betrothed to a woman who  practically worshipped the ground she walked on.  Nothing was lacking  at all…but Allegra had been her friend long before she had her devoted  fans, and was now promising lifelong devotion, perhaps even sacrificing  a few of her own dreams.  Kate suddenly wondered for a moment if her  bride-to-be felt the same way.</p>
<p>            “That’s so sweet of you.  Um…could you excuse me for a second?  I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>             “Sure, take your time.”  Allegra’s smile was becoming more and more  attractive every time it was released—and yet wasn’t she suffering from  a host of inner demons?  Kate weighed this in her mind as she went back  to her future bride, patiently waited for her hungry kisses to subside,  and spoke to her as best she could, having only a childish grasp of the  language.</p>
<p>            “I think stay here, so I tell friend and she stay here too.”</p>
<p>“Good, good!” squealed the woman.  “Your friend is most welcome.  I’m sure we could find a strong mate for her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but she say she stay with me all time.  If I go away, back to Faraway Place, you go too?”</p>
<p>“You mean you’d <em>leave</em> me?”</p>
<p>“No, I say I go, I ask you come.  Would you come?”</p>
<p>“I  couldn’t leave this place!” she exclaimed in horror, shaking her head  violently.  “This is my home; this is my family!  I’ve grown up here  and I’ll die here!  Why should I go with you, anyway?  You said you’d  stay here with <em>me!</em>”  Kate suspected a response like that, and  couldn’t deny her disappointment.  Allegra would sacrifice everything  to keep her word, whereas this woman, whom Kate honestly did not feel  any true affection for, was content to stay on her world, which she  could totally understand.  But the contrast was sharp and she realized  what an incredible mistake it would be to stay there.  Her bride-to-be,  and soon the entire enclave, protested wildly as she declared her  intentions, but Kate couldn’t be with anyone that wasn’t willing to  stay by her side.</p>
<p>Allegra was aghast as she saw the crowd following after her friend.  She assumed the worst and yelped.</p>
<p>“Hot dayum, what did ya tell them?!  They act like you desecrated a shrine or something!”</p>
<p>“I  must be popular!” Kate yelled.  As she looked back, though, she noticed  only a few Amazonians were really after her.  A large portion of the  crowd was chasing after somebody else, wielding weapons and throwing  everything they could get their hands at.  Allegra’s sharp eyes noticed  the unfortunate person was Lil, clutching her ill-gotten medallion  stubbornly as she sprinted ahead of the angry mob.</p>
<p>“I shoulda figured she’d ruffle their feathers the wrong way!” Allegra shouted.  “Hey, Lily!  What’d ya do, burn down a house?”</p>
<p>“Shit!  Just shut up and keep running!  They found out I wasn’t really a Queen!”</p>
<p>“What?!  How in the world did they—“</p>
<p>“The  stupid temp tattoo wore off!”  It became too loud to speak after that;  the trio just concentrated on running, and once they saw the ship, they  roared for everyone already onboard to start the engines.  Luckily, the  Acheron sisters were much too professional to panic—in fact, Tee  chuckled crudely and sighed, “Ah, poetic justice!”  The ship’s hatch  safely closed on the trio as they dove in headfirst, and the <em>Dauntless</em> climbed up into the heavens once more, pelted by spears and arrows and  angry curses.  Allegra, Kate, and Lillianne caught their breath and  slowly crawled to their feet, flustered and glowing victoriously.</p>
<p>            “Never a dull moment, huh?”  Kate couldn’t help but laugh in spite of how close she came to being trampled.</p>
<p>“Nope!   I think I made the right choice after all!”  Allegra smiled warmly, and  reached over to clap her shoulder.  Everyone had always seen Lady van  Landingham as a southern dandy, a polite and cheerful woman whose charm  was only surpassed by her quick draw and feisty behavior.  But in that  moment she was angelic, bursting with love and joy as she began to  understand what Kate gave up in order to stay on the ship.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you decided to stay,” she whispered softly.  Kate glowed hot pink and smiled.</p>
<p>“Me  too.”  She took a deep breath to clear her head as Allegra and Lil  stormed off, demanding one thing or another.  Her heart had not yet  stopped pounding even though she had been at rest for some time.  She  finally came to a conclusion that had been nestling in her head like a  seed, just waiting to sprout.</p>
<p><em>Oh my god, I think I’m in love!</em></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             It takes a lot of inner strength to go against the status quo and stand  up for your beliefs, and Nalia, daughter of Nervasse the guard,  experienced firsthand the consequences that are often dealt to the  avant-garde.  It’s a universal truth in most cultures that the nail  that sticks out gets hammered down, and because she refused to control  her unnatural affection towards men, Nalia was permanently exiled from  her tribe.  But this was not a time of sadness for her, even though she  had stayed faithful to her sisters in spite of her solitude, and had  worked hard to fit in.  She was now free to live her own life, to love  those she chose, and perhaps to start her own enclave, where Amazonians  like her could coexist in peace with the males.  To her sisters this  was an exile; to Nalia, it was an opportunity.  She didn’t even look  back as she went on her way.</p>
