<a href="../original/descent-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Interlude: A conversation between old friends

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Lucy leaned forward, golden hair
gleaming in the sun, &quot;how can you have a rebellion of
the angels when God sees all and knows all?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the young priest hesitated, brown hair falling
before round spectacles.

&quot;The only way the Morningstar could have rebelled is
if God let him,&quot; Lucy said, her lovely blue eyes
glowing with satisfaction of an argument won, &quot;which
makes the war between heaven and hell just an
elaborate game of solitaire.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not quite that simple,&quot; he started when another
woman walked over to them.

With a weary sigh the tall woman put her hand on
Lucy&#39;s shoulder, giving the priest an apologetic
smile. &quot;Don&#39;t mind her,&quot; the black haired lady said,
her voice oddly beautiful like the songs of an angels,
&quot;she gets argumentative when she&#39;s tanked.&quot;

&quot;I do not,&quot; Lucy complained, ignoring the bottles that
nearly covered the little table.

&quot;Actually I rather enjoyed the conversation,&quot; he
confided to them as he rose, &quot;but it seems my work
awaits me.&quot; With that he collected his coat and moved
off, soon disappearing into the teeming crowds on the
nearby street.

The open air cafe was set on a side street, food and
wine flowing freely as waiters and waitresses hurried
to serve the evening&#39;s clients. The food was good,
university students and the kids from the nearby
religious college coming together to drink and talk
eagerly.

&quot;I was just having fun, Michael,&quot; Lucy complained as a
waiter collected all the bottles and left them two
beers.

Michael sat down, opened her beer and took a drink,
sighing at the pleasure of the taste. &quot;You were taking
advantage,&quot; she pointed out, &quot;after all, you were
there Lucifer.&quot;

Lucy casually twisted the cap off her own beer and
sighed, &quot;yeah, well, it was a long time ago and the
wench is dead.&quot;

&quot;Shakespeare,&quot; Michael noted, &quot;he was one of your best
creations.&quot;

Lucy paused with her beer part way to her mouth and
asked the archangel, &quot;I thought that he was one of
yours?&quot;

Michael shrugged, &quot;Or maybe he was just a human with a
spark of creativity.&quot;

Lucy nodded glumly in agreement. Humans were confusing
to both Angels and Fallen, to say the least. It was
the whole free will thing that was the root of the
problem. A human could choose to create something of
incredible beauty or inflict incredible horror on his
fellow man, sometimes caused by the very same person.
Good and evil lived together within the hearts of men,
just waiting for the right circumstances to come to
bloom.

&quot;So who gets to take the blame for George W. Bush?&quot;
Lucy asked her wryly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think either side wants him,&quot; Michael flatly
answered. She flipped open the menu and read
thoughtfully, &quot;You know, I don&#39;t remember the last
time I&#39;ve had chocolate.&quot;

Lucy looked at her in disbelief, &quot;You must be kidding,
chocolate is one of the best reasons to become
incarnate.&quot; She smiled wickedly, &quot;That, and sex.&quot;

&quot;You never change,&quot; Michael sighed.

With a flash of seriousness Lucy answered, &quot;Oh I have
changed, quite a bit.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Michael sighed out. She saw a waiter going
by and flagged him down to place her order for lunch
and chocolate fudge ice cream for desert.

Lucy smirked as she ordered her own food, going one
better than her companion by ordering a thick
milkshake with dinner along with the same desert. She
picked up her beer and finished it off, wiping her
mouth and sighing, &quot;I wish we could get really drunk,
rather than just buzzed.&quot;

&quot;Divine or infernal beings should not let their
faculties be impaired by alcohol,&quot; Michael said to her
stiffly.

Lucy just rolled her eyes at that, &quot;You need to loosen
up.&quot;

Michael finished her own beer, &quot;I&#39;m about as loose as
I&#39;m going to get.&quot;

&quot;Ain&#39;t that the truth,:&quot; Lucy murmured.

The waiter came over with the two fully loaded trays
and set them down, then hurried to meet another call.
Thick slabs of burgers, wedge fries and drinks were
set up, along with the decadent Death by Chocolate
deserts waiting till they were done.

&quot;Forgive me for my gluttony,&quot; Michael took the time to
murmur before digging in.

Lucy tried not to groan. &quot;I think the big guy will
forgive one of his warrior host for this,&quot; she
commented as she dug into her own burger.

Michael dipped some fries in ketchup, sighing happily
as she ate. &quot;I hate to bring up business....&quot; she
started to say quietly.

Lucy slurped some of her milkshake, &quot;I didn&#39;t think
you wanted to see me for my personality, Michael.
What&#39;s up?&quot;

Michael bit into her burger, &quot;A demon-golem servant
was sent to Earth a few months ago, intended to open
one of the gates.&quot;

&quot;Summoned by a human,&quot; Lucy smiled grimly, &quot;therefore
within the rules.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t deny it,&quot; Michael agreed, &quot;it&#39;s what happened
afterward that concerns us.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Lucy got it, &quot;the human soul that possessed the
golem. Your side has always had issues with humans
possessing that kind of power.&quot;

&quot;Power, especially that granted by demons, corrupts,&quot;
Michael took a drink.

&quot;Considering the human is using the power to fight
human evil,&quot; Lucy commented, &quot;it certainly hasn&#39;t
corrupted the human soul yet.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s only a matter of time,&quot; Michael sighed. She
dipped her fries in more ketchup, &quot;As the human soul
was already damned for summoning the demon, could you
call them both back?&quot;

Lucy shook her head, &quot;It&#39;s not that simple.&quot; A wry
smile, &quot;The soul in question has begun to tip towards
good, I cannot influence it in it&#39;s current
condition.&quot;

&quot;Why was I not told...?&quot; Michael looked surprised.

&quot;The Throne&#39;s ways are often mysterious,&quot; Lucy said
with a devilish little twinkle in her eyes. She
finished off her burger and fries then slurped up more
of the milkshake, &quot;But don&#39;t you have a agent on the
spot?&quot;

Michael made a face, &quot;The knight is hard to reach, and
unless she chooses to call upon higher powers we
cannot communicate with her.&quot;

&quot;And neither of us can directly intervene,&quot; Lucy noted
with a smile. Finishing off her drink she pulled the
desert over, &quot;Though personally, I&#39;d rather just let
the two of them work.&quot;

Michael finished off her dinner, burping softly. &quot;I
thought the woman they are opposing, Lady Diana, was
one of yours?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She is supported by a patron demon,&quot; Lucy conceded.
She looked thoughtful, &quot;However she&#39;s getting...
ambitious.&quot;

&quot;I thought your side liked that,&quot; Michael smirked.

Lucy scooped up chocolate and munched happily, &quot;In
moderation, yes. The Lady seems to be interested in
gaining more power than I&#39;d care to see her have,
though.&quot;

&quot;Is she a threat to the Throne as well?&quot; Michael
sounded concerned.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Lucy said frankly. She licked her lips,
&quot;She&#39;d like to upset the balance of power below before
she attempts to challenge the Throne.&quot;

Michael glumly ate some chocolate, &quot;We wouldn&#39;t want
to see things change too much in your realm, either.&quot;

&quot;There are still pieces on the board who haven&#39;t been
revealed,&quot; Lucy said, &quot;we&#39;ll just have to see how
things play out.&quot;

&quot;I hate waiting,&quot; Michael scowled, pointing at Lucy
with her spoon.

Lucy bent forward, catching a drip of chocolate from
the spoon with her tongue. &quot;I know,&quot; she purred, &quot;it&#39;s
one of your few flaws.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease,&quot; Michael blushed.

&quot;But it&#39;s so fun,&quot; Lucy smirked. She looked at
Michael, &quot;Do you ever think about how we were before
the Fall?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Michael&#39;s eyes were touched by sorrow. She
quickly shook her head as she added, &quot;But the past is
gone, Lucifer.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Lucy finished her food then rose,
flashing a regretful smile before walking out onto the
street and disappearing.

Michael sat there alone for a moment, toying with the
last of her desert until the waiter appeared. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot;
he smiled, &quot;the young lady explained you&#39;ll be taking
care of the bill.&quot;

Michael stared at the sheet then looked around wildly
before yelling, &quot;Lucy!?&quot;

Impish laughter was the only reply.

To be continued....

Authors Note: I did a lot of borrowing in this
episode, sorry to say. Part of this episode was
inspired by Good Omens, a novel by Neil Gaiman and
Terry Pratchett. There are some very amusing
angel/demon conversations in there, of which I&#39;ve
probably ripped off a little. The idea that all angels
and demons are female is partially inspired by Todd
McFarlane&#39;s Spawn comics, with my own twists tossed
in. Refering to &#39;the Throne&#39; comes from Kevin Smith&#39;s Dogma.</pre>
