<a href="../original/angelgift-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>        The silver skinned figure looked in on the group that were 
settling down to eat, a slight smile on her face. Quietly Roma entered 
the kitchen to explain to the busily working Milly, &quot;I do not need to 
eat food. Would you mind if I attend to other matters while Marilyn 
eats?&quot;

        The redheaded catgirl nodded, &quot;That&#39;s all right.&quot; Milly 
frowned slightly, &quot;Just means I have someone else there to keep an eye 
on that Amara!&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Roma said quite agreeably. Privately she 
suspected that Marilyn probably wouldn&#39;t be all that helpful to Milly, 
but she wasn&#39;t going to point that out. She turned and left while 
softly adding, &quot;Have a nice dinner.&quot;

        With most of the residents sitting in the dining room, the 
halls of the spacious suite were mostly quiet as Roma made her way 
back to the bedroom she shared with Marilyn. She entered, walking over 
to sit down at the desk. She leaned back a bit and closed her eyes, 
shutting out the world and turning her mind inward...

Opening primary data files.

Field report, Galactic Patrol Android Roma, 2003.10.09

I am maintaining and updating these reports in the hope that when we 
are finally rescued they will be of some use for our superior 
officers. And if we are not rescued, then I hope that these files may 
at least be of historical interest to those archeologists that might 
find whatever remains of my motherboards and memory archives.

For the past several years this unit and Marilyn have been stationed 
at a remote sensing post at the far edge of the traditional Galactic 
Patrol territory. I have remarked in the past that I believe we were 
both assigned there primarily to keep Marilyn, a child of one of the 
highest noble families of the Empire, out of danger, so I will not 
dwell on it here.

An all points bulletin was issued from the Empire, requesting that all 
Galactic Patrol stations provide any and all necessary assistance in 
recovering the Princess Jenna. Using our specialized equipment Marilyn 
was able to determine the world that Jenna had likely fled to, the 
third planet of a star commonly referred to as Sol.

Despite my attempts to argue otherwise, Marilyn was determined to take 
our patrol cruiser out and attempt to verify the data, rather than 
send a message back to headquarters regarding our discovery. As 
Galactic Patrol regulations clearly forbid an android officer from 
countermanding the orders of an organic one, I was forced to agree.

Our trip to the planet of Sol-3 was relatively uneventful, but our 
attempt to establish a stable orbit there was unsuccessful.

        &#39;Unsuccessful,&#39; Roma sighed to herself softly, &#39;was putting it 
mildly.&#39; They had been knocked right out of orbit and into a barely 
controlled crash, something she rather suspected was in part the fault 
of her partner&#39;s rather... unorthodox ship-handling. &#39;Now, how do I 
put this as diplomatically as possible?&#39; she wondered...

Due to unforeseen circumstances our ship was dislodged from it&#39;s 
orbit. Despite the valiant efforts of officer Marilyn we were forced 
to splash down in a small body of water. Luckily, our crash point was 
nearby the primary nexus of our target&#39;s activity, and an short 
emergency teleport brought us directly to where they were.

        Roma tilted her head slightly, thinking about that a moment. 
She had teleported to a location above the ground, knowing there was 
less chance of teleporting into an object that way. The two had 
materialized there in that little bookstore and fell right on top of 
two young women.

        While Marilyn was gushing over Allison Roma had found herself 
meeting a brown haired woman&#39;s cheerful gaze. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she 
asked.

        The woman she would later identify as Kat had smiled slightly, 
&quot;I think so.&quot;

After we introduced ourselves a piece of quick thinking on Marilyn&#39;s 
part quickly allowed us to integrate ourselves into the social web 
forming around Princess Jenna and her companions.

        &#39;Marilyn started crying,&#39; Roma thought to herself with a wryly 
smile, &#39;and they felt so sorry for us they let us stay here.&#39;

My impressions on the companions are varied, but I will attempt to 
record them all here. Princess Jenna is both willful but oddly kind, 
watching over the others protectively. Even relative strangers such as 
myself and Marilyn have received her generous care. Her 
servant/bodyguard Milly has followed her here loyally, watching over 
her Princess vigilantly.

Sometime after she arrived her Jenna bonded with an Earther, Allison 
Tennison. An oddly handsome brown haired woman, she seems entirely out 
of her depth in this situation. But oddly, she refuses to retreat, 
coping with things that should be far beyond her understanding.

The Quester Sharin was the first to arrive her after Jenna, and was 
also the first to become aware of the bonding. I believe that is a 
past friendship between the two women that prevents her from severing 
the bond by slaying Allison. She has reluctantly joined in watching 
over Jenna along with Milly.

Shortly after our arrival we came into contact with a bounty hunter, 
one seeking a reward for the return of Jenna. Using a remarkable grasp 
of tactics Amara confronted Sharin, tricking her into leading her back 
to Jenna. It&#39;s quite possible that Amara might have succeeded in 
taking Jenna, if not for a past connection between her and Allison.

Kat...

        Roma opened her eyes, a slight frown on her face. When Kat had 
offered the job to her and Marilyn, she had felt an odd surge of 
happiness, one that she had difficulty explaining. The amused, warm 
glance that Kat gaze, her dry wit in handling what was clearly a 
bizarre situation for her, it all drew Roma to her, somehow.

An employee at Allison&#39;s bookstore, the books being a popular form of 
primitive data-storage here, Kat has been very helpful in our 
assimilation into this planet&#39;s culture, as well as providing valuable 
advice on their society.

        Roma had to smile to herself, thinking of the whole &#39;panties&#39; 
episode. Created by and spending the majority of her existence among 
spacer cultures she had little understanding of this primitive 
planet&#39;s codes of conduct. At the time she hadn&#39;t understood the 
sexual undertones of panties, or the odd fetishism they had here in 
certain parts of the world.

        Shopping with Kat had been an interesting experience, not just 
because of the varied clothing but because of her own reactions. She 
had found herself studying Kat&#39;s reactions, letting the young woman 
guide her choices. She wanted to please Kat, though she wasn&#39;t quite 
certain why.

Recording End.

        Roma got up out of the chair, pacing restlessly. She stopped 
after a few moments, then shimmered with rainbow light as she 
activated her holographic disguise.

        &quot;That&#39;s better,&quot; Roma murmured, her short red-gold hair 
falling into golden eyes. She stepped over to the closet, pulling on a 
comfortable outfit, being careful to remember the panties.

        The others were occupied with their dinner, and Roma was able 
to slip outside quietly. The elevator took her to ground level and she 
walked out into the street. The sun was down, the stars glittering 
above her as she walked the streets alone. As she grew nearer the shop 
lights glowed merrily, and she smiled.

        Kat looked up as the bell above the door rang, smiling as she 
saw Roma walk in. &quot;I thought tonight was your day off?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;I decided I&#39;d rather be here,&quot; Roma said honestly, navigating 
her way through the shelves to the desk that Kat sat at.

        &quot;It&#39;s been pretty quiet tonight,&quot; Kat admitted as she set 
aside the book she had been aimlessly flipping through, &quot;I could use 
the company.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Roma answered softly, settling down beside her.
