<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 17 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>&quot;Now,&quot; the young man burst inside the doors, his face
covered up by a mask and waving around a shotgun as he
snarled, &quot;give me all your money and no one gets
hurt!&quot;

&quot;Boy did you pick the wrong bar,&quot; Circe said after a
moment, the blonde fighting back a impish smile.

The boy held his gun a bit nervously as his eyes
darted around to look at the men and women who were
still calmly sitting around the bar. Oddly they seemed
quite unthreatened by the gun, almost amused. &quot;The
money, damn it!&quot; he yelled.

&quot;You new in town?&quot; Susan asked mildly, the unusually
pale young woman giving him a almost hungry look.

&quot;Well, yes...&quot; he answered before he visibly shook
himself and asked, &quot;What the hell? What is this
place?&quot;

Susan moved like a shot, disappearing from her seat to
reappear by his side, wrenching the gun from his hands
with inhuman speed. &quot;A very unique bar,&quot; Susan
answered him coldly as she casually took the gun&#39;s
barrel in her hands and then with little visible
strain bent it in half before handing it back to him.

&quot;Holy...&quot; he dropped the ruined weapon then backed
away from her fearfully.

&quot;Bad boy,&quot; a tall, nearly bearlike man grabbed him
then bodily picked him up before he could even fight.

&quot;Circe,&quot; Erin called from where she was casually
drinking at her and Susan&#39;s table, &quot;what should we do
with him?&quot;

Circe walked over, reaching up to pull his hood off.
&#145;Only a teen,&#39; she confirmed even as she gazed at his
average face. &quot;Hold him still for me, Bear,&quot; she
ordered.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Bear shrugged, muscles rippling.

&quot;What are you...&quot; the boy squeaked.

&quot;This won&#39;t hurt, much,&quot; Circe put her hand on the
boy&#39;s brow and muttered a few words, something very
like a spark leaping from her fingers into his head.

&quot;Ow!&quot; the boy yelped.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Circe said as she turned away, &quot;throw him
out.&quot;

&quot;Hey, not so rough,&quot; the boy squealed as he was
swiftly pitched out the front door head first. He hit
the ground with a thump, scrambled back to his feet
then ran away as fast as his feet could carry him.

&quot;Thanks Bear,&quot; Circe waved as she headed back up to
the bar.

&quot;That was merciful,&quot; Sam noted as Circe walked by her,
the gun slinging priest wiping off a table like a pro.

&quot;He was just a dumb kid,&quot; Circe shrugged casually as
she explained, &quot;I just erased his memory of the bar&#39;s
location as well as adding a mental block that&#39;ll
prevent him from ever finding it again.&quot;

&quot;Here&#39;s hoping he doesn&#39;t do anything too stupid,&quot; Sam
noted, &quot;if he tries holding up one of the Lady&#39;s
places...&quot;

&quot;Darwin in action,&quot; Circe sighed.

&quot;Darwin happens,&quot; a redhead at the bar quipped.

&quot;Nice to see you, Margaret,&quot; Circe said, pausing to
kiss Diana hello.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Margaret smiled a bit sadly.

&quot;She&#39;s looking for Athena,&quot; Diana said, the tawny
haired girl only reluctantly pulling free from Circe&#39;s
grip to help a few other customers.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Circe nodded. She looked at Margaret
thoughtfully and asked, &quot;What are your intentions
towards my sister-in-law?&quot;

&quot;My intentions?&quot; Margaret actually blushed.

&quot;It&#39;s a old fashioned phrase,&quot; Circe smiled, &quot;but it
gets the point across. Well?&quot;

Margaret seemed to chose her words carefully, &quot;I like
Athena very much, and would like to get to know her
better.&quot;

Circe studied Margaret a moment, her expression
serious, then she relaxed a bit. &quot;Fair enough,&quot; she
admitted. &quot;Athena should be in later,&quot; she revealed,
&quot;I think she said she&#39;d be stopping in at Sisterhood
Books before coming home.&quot;

&quot;I should have guessed,&quot; Margaret chuckled.

&quot;Incoming!&quot; A voice cried in warning as a bowl of nuts
went flying by Margaret&#39;s head.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Diana vaulted over the bar with superhuman
agility, &quot;no brawling in the bar, damn it!&quot;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Connie Alexander paled, the leather clad
woman looking visibly pale, dropping the young man she
had been punching.

&quot;Another newcomer,&quot; Diana scowled. Fixing the black
haired woman with a look she said, &quot;What the hell is
going on?&quot;

Rubbing her fist Connie tried to smile charmingly,
&quot;I&#39;m really sorry, it&#39;s my fault.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking who&#39;s fault it was, I want to know
what happened,&quot; Diana said coldly.

The other young man ran a hand through stylish blonde
hair, &quot;The young man was trying to get Ms. Alexander&#39;s
autograph and got a bit pushy.&quot; He smiled charmingly,
&quot;My name is Simon... Simon Lane.&quot;

&quot;So who is she?&quot; Diana raised a eyebrow as she
gestured to Connie.

&quot;I need a better publicist,&quot; Connie sighed after a
moment, Simon wincing visibly.

&quot;Her song &#145;American Scream&#39; is doing well on college
radio,&quot; a amused voice noted.

Turning Diana saw Athena, the tall blonde haired
warrior looking at the situation with some amusement.
&quot;Good timing,&quot; she commented before turning back to
Connie. &quot;All right, tell me why I shouldn&#39;t kick you
all out?&quot;

&quot;Ah...&quot; Simon hesitated.

&quot;How about I sing for my supper?&quot; Connie offered
quickly. A smile, &quot;I notice you have a stage and I
have my guitar...&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Diana thought about it a moment then nodded,
&quot;fair enough. No more trouble, though, or out you go.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Connie smiled.

Leaving Connie to her preparations Diana smiled, &quot;Have
fun at the bookstore?&quot;

&quot;I was satisfied,&quot; Athena smiled.

&quot;Margaret&#39;s here, by the way,&quot; Diana warned as they
walked up to the bar.

&quot;I know,&quot; Athena smiled with a hint of embarrassment,
&quot;I was hoping to see her.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Diana hurried ahead to hop back over the bar
and help her lover Circe.

Margaret finished her drink, the redhead casually
leaning against the bar as she watched Athena grow
near. &quot;Hi,&quot; Margaret smiled.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Athena answered, glad to see the welcome in
those eyes. She leaned up beside Margaret as she said,
&quot;Have I mentioned that I can be a judgmental person?&quot;

&quot;I sort of got that impression,&quot; Margaret said
teasingly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Athena added quietly.

&quot;No, I think you were right,&quot; Margaret said quickly. A
smile, &quot;It was just the wake up call I needed.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Athena said. A pause, &quot;We&#39;re all right,
then?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Margaret reached over to squeeze her hand.

To be continued...

Note: Connie first appeared in a earlier story called
&quot;Idol&#39;s Worship.&quot;
