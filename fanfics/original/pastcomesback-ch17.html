<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>      &quot;Goodnight Tsuru,&quot; Tycara whispered, a bit quieter than usual. She gave Tsuru a kiss 
on the cheek before heading to her room. It had taken all of Tsuru&#39;s control not to cry when 
they entered the mansion, but now...

      God, her lips had been so soft. She broke down and headed towards her room, trying not 
to sob. The last thing she wanted was for Tycara to see her and try to comfort her... try 
and tell her how great she was... the whole walk back had been silent.

      &quot;Hey! How did it go?&quot; Isaka asked, coming out of her room. The demon&#39;s jovial mood was 
shattered upon seeing Tsuru&#39;s state. &quot;Tsuru... what happened...?&quot;

      &quot;She... she thinks that kind of stuff is icky...!&quot; Tsuru sobbed out. &quot;That&#39;s what she 
told me - that she&#39;s not like us, but... oh! She&#39;s so beautiful and I love her so much-!&quot;

      Isaka guided her into her room and sat down on the bed next to her. Tsuru kept on 
talking. &quot;I thought... that maybe, maybe she liked me back and I kissed her and it was 
so...&quot; She turned to the demon, still distraught. &quot;It was so perfect, Isaka. But she doesn&#39;t 
like girls and she didn&#39;t want that and...&quot;

      She continued to cry, even as Isaka tried to calm her down. &quot;Shh, shh, it&#39;s okay 
Tsuru. You&#39;re a beautiful girl and you&#39;ll find someone else...&quot;

      &quot;But I want her...!&quot; Tsuru whined out, but she settled for the comforting words of 
Isaka.

      &quot;I&#39;m so sorry. If I had known Tycara wasn&#39;t... well I wouldn&#39;t have tried so hard to 
set you up... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the demon murmured.

      &quot;Thanks though - you really didn&#39;t have to do it,&quot; Tsuru said, sitting up to look into 
those purple eyes.

      &quot;Considering all the stuff I&#39;ve put you through, Tsuru, I thought I would try to get 
you with a nice girl... sorry...&quot;

      &quot;You don&#39;t have to be sorry, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Tsuru whispered, leaning against 
her friend.

      After a while, she could feel Isaka kissing away her tears. &quot;Cry as much as you want, 
but don&#39;t be sad, alright? There&#39;s nothing to be upset about.&quot;

      Tsuru nodded and felt herself get weak again. She really didn&#39;t care about her morals, 
her values or whatever they were. She just wanted someone to hold her and... When Isaka 
kissed her, Tsuru put up no resistance whatsoever. 

***** 

      The next morning, Tsuru felt warm and secure in the arms of the woman she once swore 
to kill. How strange. She didn&#39;t mind it at all and moved closer to her, getting a small 
kiss as a reward. Isaka nuzzled into her neck and Tsuru let out a long sigh.

      There little episode that night wasn&#39;t a one night stand, like Tsuru first assumed. 
Eventually, it became a recurring event until Tsuru and Isaka shared the same room. For 
Tsuru, it started off as comfort and convenience, but... but then she started to feel 
different about Isaka. It stopped being so physical started being so much more - the way 
Isaka spoke, the things they did together, the way she held her.

      Tsuru was content with their relationship and maybe... she loved the demon a bit. Just 
a little bit. Everything was great at their little mansion and Tycara had started to notice 
the two of them always together. That was when the trouble started.

      &quot;Are you two together?&quot; Tycara asked suddenly at dinner, a smile on her face.

      Tsuru blushed and prepared to confirmed it, when Isaka spoke first. &quot;Nah, we aren&#39;t.&quot;

      The blue haired girl tried to keep a look of surprise from creeping on her face and 
Tycara looked slightly confused. The demon, on the other hand, went back to eating as though 
it were nothing.

      The seeds of doubt were planted and already sprouting later that night. Tsuru was 
combing her hair, looking in the mirror. Isaka didn&#39;t really mean that, did she? That they 
weren&#39;t together? Was... she just telling Tycara that to keep her out of their business? 
Or...

      She turned around to see Isaka changing into her night gown after a long bath. Tsuru 
could feel the ominous feeling in her chest so she asked, &quot;Did you really mean what you said 
at dinner?&quot;

      &quot;Hmm?&quot; Isaka looked over at Tsuru, now dressed. &quot;What did I say?&quot;

      &quot;You said... well, Tycara asked if we were together and you said we weren&#39;t,&quot; Tsuru 
replied, still combing her hair.

      &quot;Oh, well we aren&#39;t really together,&quot; Isaka said offhandedly, not seeing the look of 
shock on Tsuru&#39;s face.

      &quot;We... aren&#39;t together? But we&#39;ve been spending so much time and sleeping... 
together!&quot; Tsuru said, trying to keep her voice from rising.

      &quot;Yeah, but... what&#39;s up with you? And what do you mean by together anyway,&quot; the demon 
asked.

      &quot;I mean it as in we&#39;re in a relationship - like we&#39;re together as in lovers.&quot;

      &quot;Oh... we&#39;re not.&quot;

      Isaka&#39;s callous words made Tsuru turn around to face her. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious? What 
do you call all this then?!&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re my friend Tsuru and I care about you deeply,&quot; the demon said, giving her a 
weird look.

      &quot;But we&#39;ve been sleeping together.&quot;

      &quot;Yes, we have.&quot;

      &quot;And when people sleep together, it means something more than just sex. So you can&#39;t 
sit here and tell me that you don&#39;t give a damn about me!&quot; Tsuru shouted and Isaka sighed.

      &quot;I do care about you. You&#39;re my friend and we just happen to sleep-&quot;

      &quot;So we&#39;re friends with benefits?&quot;

      &quot;Exactly! Ha, sorry I couldn&#39;t think of the words,&quot; Isaka said, sitting down on the 
bed.

      Tsuru couldn&#39;t believe it. She wasn&#39;t serious, was she? They&#39;d spent the last couple 
of years sleeping together and now... now she was saying it was just an offhanded fling? &quot;I 
don&#39;t believe you!&quot;

      Isaka still looked confused. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? Tsuru, that&#39;s all we&#39;ve been 
doing these last years. Why do you keep acting like that? It&#39;s not like I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t 
like you-&quot;

      She was cut off by Tsuru. &quot;Well you know what? I don&#39;t want to sleep with you anymore 
and be your little whore-&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re not my whore, you&#39;re my friend-&quot;

      &quot;So you can just find some other way to keep yourself entertained, you - you... gah!&quot; 
Tsuru left in a fury, leaving behind a demon who was confused and disorientated. 

***** 

      For the next week, Tsuru stewed in her anger. She loved the demon. She loved Isaka, so 
how could she... only think of her as a friend to screw? Maybe she overreacted, but she 
still felt like... Tsuru let out a sigh. She didn&#39;t tell Isaka how she felt, so maybe that 
would be a good starting point.

      If Isaka understood how she felt, then they should be able to come to a god 
understanding. That would solve her problems. Tsuru took a deep breath, standing outside 
Isaka&#39;s door. This time, she wasn&#39;t going to yell. She was going to stay calm and explain 
everything.

      Tsuru opened the door cautiously and noticed Isaka wasn&#39;t in her bed. In fact, she 
noticed that the person in bed wasn&#39;t Isaka. She stood there, shocked, staring at the 
unknown, nude girl. She was asleep in the demon&#39;s bed and probably some poor girl that Isaka 
picked up because she was pretty. Tsuru promised herself she wouldn&#39;t get angry, but the 
hatred built up in her at unimaginable heights.

      Isaka came out of the bathroom at just the right time. She looked over at Tsuru who 
immediately dragged her outside the room. &quot;Isaka! Who the hell is that?&quot;

      Isaka glanced back over into her room. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a girl I met the other day. She&#39;s a 
bit unsure of her orientation, so I was just helping her figure it out.&quot;

      Tsuru clenched her teeth at the demon&#39;s nonchalance. &quot;How... how could you? What about 
me?&quot;

      Isaka gave her a surprised look. &quot;But... I thought you didn&#39;t want to sleep with me.&quot;

      &quot;That doesn&#39;t... that doesn&#39;t mean you can go sleeping with other girls once we have a 
bit of a fallout- it&#39;s only been a week!&quot;

      &quot;A fallout? Tsuru, we weren&#39;t even in a relationship in the first place! If you&#39;re 
trying to tell me something, then just tell me!&quot; Tsuru looked into the demon&#39;s eyes and felt 
that little bit of love die. Isaka truly didn&#39;t understand - she wasn&#39;t faking her 
confusion. She genuinely didn&#39;t understand how Tsuru felt.

      &quot;I... I can&#39;t believe I actually loved you,&quot; Tsuru said, angry at herself for having 
mistaken Isaka&#39;s flirty motions for love. &quot;I actually loved you and thought you loved me 
back, but look at how wrong I am.&quot;

      She started to wipe at her tears, noticing Isaka&#39;s startled expression. &quot;What? You 
couldn&#39;t tell? Well, I wouldn&#39;t expect someone like you to understand - to understand how it 
feels to get your heart trampled because the other person doesn&#39;t give a damn about you! You 
know what?&quot; Tsuru said, looking straight into those purple eyes.

      &quot;I hope... I hope that one day, you go through this same exact pain, because this is 
exactly what a person like you deserves.&quot;

      With those last words, Tsuru turned on her heel and headed down the hallway. She could 
hear Isaka calling out to her. &quot;Tsuru, Tsuru! I didn&#39;t know, okay? I&#39;m sorry!&quot;

      But the demon could never love her and Tsuru knew that even her love was just a sham. 
She wanted to be content and love someone... The blue haired girl began to gather her 
clothes, her valuables, her weapons.

      &quot;...are you leaving?&quot; Tsuru looked up to see Tycara in the doorway of her room.

      &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m sorry. Isaka will take good care of you,&quot; Tsuru murmured, stroking the 
girl&#39;s silver hair.

      Tycara gave an awkward nod. &quot;I know you&#39;ll find someone, Tsuru...&quot; The hybrid bit her 
lip. &quot;...are you never coming back?&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head and grabbed the red jewel from her belongings. She broke it in 
half and watched it shine. &quot;If you hold onto this, we&#39;ll find each other again. It will 
shine when I&#39;m nearby or when one of my friends is... he&#39;s a nice guy too.&quot;

      Tycara took it and clutched it to her chest. She gave Tsuru a kiss on the cheek. &quot;I&#39;ll 
be waiting for you.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;I never really did think about her feelings - I just assumed we needed each other&#39;s 
physical comfort. After that, I just... couldn&#39;t bring myself to sleep with as many girls,&quot; 
Isaka said, looking over at Krystal. &quot;I just facilitated relationships instead, because I 
hurt Tsuru so bad... but I didn&#39;t love her so it wouldn&#39;t have worked out anyway.&quot;

      &quot;So she&#39;s angry for getting her heart broken?&quot; Krystal asked, unsure of how to take 
the situation.

      &quot;I think she&#39;s more upset about me breaking her trust. I was such a... It wasn&#39;t until 
she said that to me that I remembered the first girl I loved - the girl who took me in like 
a sister. And the pain I felt when she rejected me,&quot; Isaka sat down on the bed with a sigh. 
&quot;But I seriously thought that if Tycara was going to go gay for any girl, it would have been 
Tsuru.&quot;

      Krystal sat down next to her and Isaka said, &quot;But don&#39;t ever doubt me. I love you more 
than anything, Krystal, more than my sister or any of the girl I&#39;ve ever been with. At 
first... I guess at first it started off as any other fling, but after we&#39;ve spent so much 
time together...&quot;

      The demon closed her eyes and lied back on the bed. &quot;It hurts a lot when you&#39;re not 
around, so I know how much I care about you. I love you... just so much. Maybe I&#39;m a bit 
selfish, but I hope Tsuru&#39;s little curse doesn&#39;t come true... I don&#39;t want to lose-&quot;

      Isaka was cut off by a kiss from her lover. After Krystal pulled away, she said with a 
smile, &quot;We&#39;re going to be late.&quot;
