<h1>Through Death Comes Life (part 13 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>      &quot;No way.&quot;

      &quot;I-I&#39;m not joking!&quot;

      &quot;I know, but... that&#39;s a bit farfetched.&quot;

      &quot;Mi-na! I&#39;m serious!&quot; During their walk home, Eveon had been trying unsuccessfully to 
explain what had happened. Mina didn&#39;t believe that the Living Inferno was a girl. She did, 
however, believe he slept with Abby. &quot;It&#39;s just weird, Eveon. Your mom loved your dad or 
else you wouldn&#39;t have been born! People don&#39;t just cross the line... I mean, it&#39;s possible, 
but in a matter of weeks?&quot;

      Eveon just pouted until Mina tried to make it up to her with a small kiss. &quot;How about 
we have a little bet?&quot; Mina asked, mischief dancing in her blue eyes. Eveon smiled 
confidently. &quot;Alright. What are the terms?&quot; As they walked up the path to the front door, 
Mina said, &quot;The loser has to do whatever the winner wants.&quot;

      She only gave Mina a little nudge. &quot;You know, if I win... that&#39;ll mean you still owe 
me for the poker game and now this!&quot; Mina just gave her a demure look. &quot;I know... you can do 
whatever you want with me, Eveon. I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

      Their passionate moment was interrupted by Seth, who was awkwardly standing behind 
them with a bag of groceries. &quot;Um... not that I want to be a nuisance, but I noticed you 
were missing some things in the fridge, so I went shopping.&quot; He looked at the two girls, 
then the door. &quot;Wanna open it for me?&quot;

      Eveon just laughed before opening the door and letting Seth inside. Vaguely, Mina 
wondered how hard Eveon was trying to hide her sadness. Abby didn&#39;t have much time left, did 
she? The trio went inside, all of them looking for Abby.

      &quot;You know... I got this call from Faye about the Living Inferno...&quot; Seth started, 
trying to see if the two girls knew what he was talking about. Eveon&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;I knew 
it! Faye must have seen her! She said the Living Inferno was really a girl right?&quot; Before 
Seth could answer, Mina started towards the stairs. &quot;No way! That can&#39;t be... there&#39;s no way 
I&#39;m going to lose this bet, Eveon!&quot;

      Eveon followed after her and Seth let out a sigh as the two girls bickered all the way 
up the stairs. Mina really wanted to win and be able to... well, have Eveon bend to her 
will. Not that the blonde didn&#39;t already, but... &quot;I&#39;m going to show you that you&#39;re wrong 
and that your mother is straight!&quot; Seth scratched the back of his head as the two girls 
disappeared from view. &quot;...but I think Abby&#39;s a lesbian now,&quot; Seth murmured to himself.

      Of course, both girls continued until they reached Abby&#39;s room. They froze. Mina 
placed her hand on the doorknob. They exchanged worried looks. &quot;Mina... if we open this door 
and... um, they aren&#39;t, you know, properly dressed... I mean, that&#39;s my mommy and if there 
is a guy, I don&#39;t want to see any of that.&quot; Mina nodded at Eveon&#39;s words and both girls took 
a deep breath as they opened the door to reveal-

      Nothing. There was no one in the bed, or on the ground or where else a couple could be 
enjoying alone time. The two girls stood there, silent, until the bathroom door opened. Abby 
came out, brushing her teeth before giving the two girls a strange look.

      &quot;Seriously. Why does everyone barge in here?&quot; Abby went back and spit into the sink 
before putting her brush away. Eveon just stared at her mom. &quot;You know, mommy, if this keeps 
up, you&#39;re going to start looking like my older sister.&quot;

      The blonde woman just scoffed and sat down on the edge of the bed. &quot;Whatever. So what 
do you two want?&quot; Mina was the one who answered. &quot;We want to see the Living Inferno!&quot; Abby 
looked around the room. &quot;You didn&#39;t see her? I wonder where Sakura went off to...&quot;

      Both girls froze. &quot;S-she...? Sakura?&quot; Mina asked before letting out an agonizing cry. 
&quot;No! That can&#39;t be! I don&#39;t wanna lose the bet.&quot; Eveon just looked rather smug as her 
girlfriend started out of the room.

      Of course, it was Seth who found Sakura first. The young man started to put away some 
of the groceries he bought when he felt a shiver go down his spine. He turned around, only 
to see Sakura staring at him intently. He took in the sight of the young woman and stared 
into her red eyes. &quot;At the risk of sounding like a jerk... are you the Living Inferno?&quot;

      She nodded simply. Seth just kind of looked around. &quot;Um, alright... this is 
awkward...&quot; They stood there for a few more minutes before Seth spoke again. &quot;So, uh, it 
just seems strange since I know you, but... weird. You&#39;re a girl.&quot; He fidgeted a bit, but 
was luckily saved when Mina came into the kitchen.

      Eveon was right behind her and came just in time to see Mina&#39;s rather disappointed 
look. Sakura only gave the two of them a shy wave. &quot;Ha! I told you, Mina.&quot; Her girlfriend 
wheeled around and grasped Eveon desperately. &quot;That&#39;s not fair... I wanted to have you 
wrapped around my finger...!&quot;

      Seth suddenly said, &quot;You know what? I think I am going to go watch some TV.&quot; The young 
man politely exited the room as Sakura walked over to the two girls. Eveon looked up when 
she felt a hand run through her hair.

      Sakura pulled away, but Eveon only smiled. &quot;It feels a lot different without your 
armor, huh?&quot; Mina wasn&#39;t too happy with the outcome of this whole visit. 

***** 

      When Abby came downstairs five minutes later, she was surprised to see that she had 
quite a crowd in her living room. She stifled a laugh when she noticed the irritated look on 
Mina&#39;s face. The ebony haired girl wasn&#39;t too happy that her girlfriend was currently taking 
a nap using Sakura&#39;s lap as a pillow.

      Seth, of course, was in his own humble little world. He was a man surrounded by 
lesbians. Male fantasy for some, awkward situation for others. Abby sat down next to Sakura, 
startling the white haired woman just a bit. &quot;Some things never change, with or without your 
armor.&quot; The angel blushed slightly, stroking Eveon&#39;s blonde hair.

      &quot;Poor Mina,&quot; Abby said, bringing attention to the fuming adolescent, &quot;Too bad Eveon 
isn&#39;t sleeping in your lap, neh?&quot; Mina pouted and looked away. &quot;Why do you have to be so 
mean? I already lost the bet and now Eveon...&quot; Sakura fidgeted, seeing as she was sitting in 
between the two females.

      The door bell rang and Seth shot up out of his seat. &quot;Well, I&#39;ll go get the door,&quot; he 
said enthusiastically, wanting any excuse to get out of the living room. He opened the front 
door and smiled at the two women. Faye and Erin were dressed casually, holding hands. Seth 
had been half afraid he would open the door to find them making out on the front porch.

      &quot;Hey, Seth! Is everyone here?&quot; Erin asked as she dragged in by Faye. &quot;Nah, Krystal and 
Isaka aren&#39;t here yet,&quot; the young man replied. Faye looked thoughtful and said, &quot;That makes 
sense. When I called Isaka she got mad because I was interrupting her and Krystal.&quot; Seth 
flushed bright red and Faye rolled her eyes.

      &quot;Goodness, Seth! Stop being such a virgin!&quot; Seth flinched and looked away. &quot;H-how do 
you know that I haven&#39;t...?&quot; Faye winked at him. &quot;I&#39;m the Goddess of Love. Don&#39;t think I 
don&#39;t know these things!&quot;

      Without further ado, the red head continued into the living room. Erin just gave Seth 
an apologetic smile before following her lover. Seth let out a long sigh, still holding the 
door open.

      &quot;Wow, thanks Seth... but Abby might be mad if you leave the door open.&quot; Seth nearly 
jumped out of his skin at the sound of another voice. He turned to see Krystal smiling as 
she walked through the door. &quot;Oh, hey Krystal... I didn&#39;t see you there.&quot; She smiled 
brightly and he noticed something was off.

      Where was- &quot;Yo, straight boy.&quot; Seth turned to see Isaka leaning against the door 
frame. &quot;You aren&#39;t hitting on MY precious Krystal, are you?&quot; He let out an exasperated sigh 
and Krystal gave Isaka an angry look. &quot;I can&#39;t even say hi to Seth?&quot; Isaka looked away, but 
let Krystal pull her inside. &quot;I&#39;ll make it up to you tonight,&quot; Krystal whispered into the 
demon&#39;s ear.

      Unfortunately, Seth happened to overhear it. As the two women walked away, he shut the 
door and murmured, &quot;I could have had a bunch of guy friends, but noooo, I had to go and hang 
out with pretty lesbians...&quot; 

***** 

      Seth was trying to watch the movie. Trying. However, it was inexplicably hard when he 
could hear the cooing and quiet giggles coming from behind and to the left of him. He kept 
his eyes focused on the screen, not wanting to risk turning around.

      And girls thought guys were bad... All the couples around him were too busy fondling 
each other to pay attention to the movie! And Seth was too busy trying to ignore them, so he 
totally had no clue as to what the movie was about either. Wonderful. Why did they bother 
having a movie night?

      When the movie was finally over, Seth tried not to notice how some of the girls&#39; 
clothing was disheveled. Isaka caught his embarrassed gaze and said, &quot;You know, Seth... my 
offer to turn you into a girl still stands.&quot; He just scoffed and rolled his eyes.

      &quot;Oh come on... how about for just a day? I&#39;m sure you&#39;d make a lovely girl,&quot; the demon 
said and Seth responded, &quot;Oh please. For all I know that little magic spell of yours is 
permanent.&quot; Isaka frowned. &quot;How&#39;d you know it was permanent?&quot;

      The young man was luckily saved from further embarrassment when Abby suddenly said, &quot;I 
think I only have a few days left.&quot; Everyone jerked their head in her direction, except for 
Sakura, who was staring forlornly at the ground.

      &quot;Wh-what...?&quot; Eveon asked. Abby leaned back into the couch and said, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
feeling weird, so I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t be long now. The jovial mood was gone now, no one quite 
sure of what to say. 

***** 

      Abby wasn&#39;t sure how, but sometime during the course of the night, she and Sakura 
started making love again. Amidst the gasps, the moans and whispered words, Abby heard a 
sob. The blonde woman froze and reached up in the darkness. She pulled Sakura down and in 
the dim moonlight, she could see something catch the light on her pale face.

      &quot;Don&#39;t cry... oh please, don&#39;t cry,&quot; Abby murmured, desperately trying to kiss away 
the angel&#39;s tears. &quot;Why...? Why does it have to be like this? You&#39;re the only... the only 
person who made me feel so... so...&quot; The white haired woman started to sob and Abby could 
only cradle her against her bosom.

      What could she whisper into her ear to make the pain go away? Abby couldn&#39;t say that 
&#39;it would be all right&#39; or &#39;don&#39;t worry&#39;. She found it difficult to swallow. She was going 
to die soon and there was nothing she could do to comfort the crying woman in her arms. 

***** 

      It was later that morning that Abby awoke with a start. She felt a dull, horrendous 
pain in her abdomen. She immediately shot out of Sakura&#39;s arms and headed towards the 
bathroom. Perhaps it was luck that Abby remembered to pull her hair back as she kneeled next 
to the toilet.

      She shut her eyes as yesterday&#39;s dinner found a new home in the toilet. Abby panted as 
she finished vomiting and starting wiping her mouth with some toilet paper. When she looked 
up, she saw Sakura standing in the doorway, staring at her.

      The white haired woman started to cry again as Abby flushed the toilet. Abby didn&#39;t 
have much time anymore... if any at all. 

***** 

      To Eveon, it was all so... surreal. Her mommy wasn&#39;t really going to disappear, right? 
There had to be some sort of divine intervention... right? Right? She never really 
affiliated with any religion, but Eveon sure as heck hoped there was a god who was 
listening.

      Then again, she knew two goddesses who couldn&#39;t help. Maybe she was wasting her 
prayers... Mina had been wholly supportive, trying to mitigate the pain. Unfortunately, 
Mina&#39;s method of mitigation involved a couple of hickeys and risqu&Atilde;&copy; make out sessions in the 
girls&#39; bathroom at school. The blonde girl let out a sigh before opening her front door. The 
sight she would soon see in the kitchen... well...

      Eveon just stared. Her mother was in the kitchen. That in and of itself wasn&#39;t 
unusual, but the fact that there were assortments of half eaten food spread around on the 
countertop was... and the fact that Abby was chugging orange juice straight from the carton. 
When the blonde woman finished, she chucked it into the trash can.

      &quot;Oh... hi, Eveon...&quot; Eveon just stared at her before saying, &quot;I know you aren&#39;t going 
to be here for long, but leaving Tycara a stomachache seems kind of cruel.&quot; Abby paused and 
smiled wearily. &quot;Dare I say it, Eveon Kasaguri; I think you&#39;re inheriting my wonderful 
humor.&quot;

      They exchanged looks before laughing a sad, forlorn laugh. Abby started eating a 
cupcake while Eveon tried to sort through all the food. &quot;But seriously, mommy... why are you 
eating all this? If you want a last supper, I can cook you some of your favorites.&quot;

      Abby shrugged and swallowed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s been up with me... I&#39;ve just been 
feeling crappy... I threw up this morning and then Sakura ran off somewhere to be alone... 
then I had the weirdest cravings. You should be happy you weren&#39;t here when I was craving a 
mustard, onion, chicken sandwich with hot sauce.&quot;

      The blonde woman giggled to herself and ate a chip. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m eating like a-&quot; She 
froze. Eveon listened, expecting her mommy to finish her sentence. Instead, Abby got a 
strange look on her face as if she were contemplating something important.

      Abby got off the stool she&#39;d sat on and started to walk towards the door. &quot;Eveon, I 
need to go get something real fast-&quot; Eveon snorted and said, &quot;Why? You got all the food in 
the world here...!&quot; Abby tried to smile but failed. &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes.&quot;

      Eveon shrugged as her mother went out the door and started to clean up the mess. Her 
mommy... was going to cease to exist pretty soon. The blonde adolescent decided that she was 
going to cook her the best meal ever!

      ...assuming Abby hadn&#39;t eaten out half the kitchen already. 

***** 

      When Abby did get back from her little trip, Eveon didn&#39;t have time to even say hello. 
Before she knew it, her mommy was practically sprinting up the stairs, holding a plastic 
grocery bag. &quot;...okay...&quot; Now she was REALLY worried. 

***** 

      Abby sat on the toilet, staring at the tiny cardboard box in her hands. She must have 
gone completely insane. The young woman sighed. What could she lose? She already went down 
the store and bought quite a few of them. The store clerk thought it quite funny... 
considering Eveon was a lesbian and he thought Abby was still single.

      Seriously, why was she doing this? Abby opened the box and took a deep breath. 
&quot;Alright... test trial number one...&quot; 

***** 

      When Abby finally did come back downstairs, she looked like she&#39;d been hit with a 
freight train. &quot;Mommy? What&#39;s wrong? You look upset!&quot; Eveon rushed over to her and helped 
her sit down on a stool near the counter. &quot;...Mommy...?&quot; Abby just ran a hand through her 
hair. &quot;...some days... I swear...it&#39;s all so weird!&quot;

      Eveon was getting steadily worried by her mother&#39;s ramblings. &quot;...do you want me to 
make you some tea or go get your alcohol stash-&quot; Abby shook her head violently and said, 
&quot;No!!! ...I-I mean, no Eveon. I can&#39;t have caffeine or alcohol so I&#39;ll just go for a sugar 
rush or... or... or...&quot; Abby started to bawl. &quot;This doesn&#39;t make any sense!!!&quot; 

***** 

      When Sakura came back, she chose to come through Abby&#39;s window. What she saw was the 
blonde woman pacing back in forth, deep in thought. Sakura watched, feeling her heart wrench 
in her chest. She&#39;d left the house for a few hours to try and calm herself... to try and 
deal with Abby&#39;s soon to be death.

      The white haired woman walked quietly over to Abby, startling the young woman. The 
blonde turned to see her lover. Her red eyes were dull with sadness. &quot;S-Sakura... I need 
to... to tell you something...&quot; The angel nodded cautiously, afraid of the words she would 
hear.

      &quot;I never thought I&#39;d say this to a woman... well, I&#39;ve done a lot of things I never 
though I&#39;d do with a woman, but... oh...&quot; Abby let out a soft sigh and felt Sakura&#39;s hand 
against her cheek. &quot;It&#39;s alright Abby... please tell me.&quot;

      Abby took Sakura&#39;s hand and placed on her abdomen. &quot;I... Sakura,&quot; she whispered out, 
an embarrassed smile on her face. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant with your child.&quot;

      Sakura&#39;s face was blank. Abby thought she&#39;d have to repeat her words, but the white 
haired woman suddenly sunk down to her knees and pulled Abby&#39;s shirt up. Sakura gripped her 
waist and placed a soft gentle kiss upon her abdomen. Abby just ran her hands through her 
silky, white locks as Sakura began to cry, her face flush up against her abdomen.
