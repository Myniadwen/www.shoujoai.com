Malicious Encounter

Nicole stood at the doorway to Natalie&#39;s room staring at the redhead. 
Kim&#39;s robe had fallen open and she was pulling it back closed and retied 
the belt before getting up to leave. Nicole put up her arm to stop the 
girl, &quot;What were you doing with my sister?&quot;  She demanded with a snarl. 

&quot;Now little girl,&quot; Kim patted the girl on the head, &quot;You are too young 
to understand.&quot; She proceeded to try and leave the room when Nicole 
produced one of the daggers from her pocket and she pointed it at the 
redhead with malicious intent, causing Kim to back away from the blade.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Nicole sneered at the girl, &quot;I told you to stay 
away from my sister.&quot; She held the knife tight in both of her hands, &quot;I 
told you to stay away!!!&quot;

&quot;Now be a good little girl and drop the knife.&quot; Kim nervously backed 
away from the girl, keeping her eyes on the sharp point of the dagger. 

&quot;Why should I?&quot; Nicole slowly advanced on the girl, backing her into a 
corner, &quot;You are dirty and you made my sis dirty too.&quot; 

&quot;Now now that is no way to talk to your elders.&quot; Kim said looking for a 
means of escaping the room when a thought entered her mind and she 
grinned mischievously at the girl, &quot;You know the truth better then I. 
Your sister is the dirty one. She wanted to touch me. You can see it in 
her eyes.&quot; She said slyly.

&quot;You lie!!!&quot; Nicole cried out, &quot;Sis, would never do that.&quot; 

&quot;Are you so certain?&quot; Kim asked stepping forward, &quot;She never told you 
about me before now did she?&quot;

Nicole&#39;s eyes darted about as she considered what she was told. It was 
true that Natalie never told Nicole much of anything about her life, but 
could she believe this girl? She began to lower the knife and Kim sprung 
upon the girl, grabbing her knife hand by the wrist and slamming the 
girl up against the windowsill making Nicole squeal out in pain. 

&quot;You should not play with knives.&quot; Kim slammed the girl&#39;s hand against 
the window frame again, causing her to drop the dagger to the ground and 
she smiled down at Nicole while holding the girl&#39;s hands against the 
window, &quot;You should also not believe everything you are told. Children 
are so naive. She leaned closer to the girl, &quot;And innocent. Shall we 
have a taste of that innocence?&quot; while holding the girl&#39;s hands with her 
right hand Kim place her left under the girl&#39;s chin forcing Nicole to 
look at her, &quot;Maybe just a small kiss?&quot; She asked Nicole as the girl 
squirmed against her hold. 

&quot;Get away from her!&quot; Natalie commanded from the doorway with Alyson 
standing at her side. 

&quot;Natalie!&quot; Kim said in surprise, &quot;I was just helping the little one to 
her feet.&quot; 

&quot;Sis, help!&quot; Nicole yelled. 

Natalie clenched her fist, &quot;I said let her go!&quot; she skirted over to the 
bed where she had dropped her necklace and reached down the corner to 
pull out the pendent. The moment that light hit the crystal Kim released 
Nicole and covered her eyes, hissing as she retreated back into the 
corner. 

Alyson stepping further into the room and wrapping an arm around Nicole 
to comfort the terrified girl, &quot;I thought I told you never to take that 
off?&quot; She stressed to Natalie.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Natalie held the necklace towards Kim, &quot;Now, who or what 
exactly are you?&quot; She asked the double of the redhead. 

&quot;I am Kimberly Harrison.&quot; The girl boasted, &quot;Your best friend and love 
slave if you wish.&quot; She blushed.

Natalie shook the necklace at the girl, &quot;Stop lying!&quot; She commanded, 
&quot;Kim is in her room sleeping soundly.&quot;

&quot;Only part of her is.&quot; The twin stated, &quot;What about the part of her that 
she locks away every day so none will see?&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Natalie looked at the girl in confusion. 

Kim sighed as she gazed out the window, &quot;I thought you would understand, 
but I guess I was wrong.&quot; The sun began to pass behind a cloud and a 
grin crossed the girl&#39;s face, &quot;We&#39;ll have to talk another time.&quot; The 
moment the last of the light faded away from the crystal Kim took to her 
feet and pushed past everyone, fleeing the room and disappearing down 
the hall before anyone could react. 

&quot;Dimmitt! Someone stop her!&quot; Natalie cried out, but it was a little too 
late, &quot;What the hell is she?&quot; Natalie asked, slipping her pendent around 
her neck, &#147;The pendent only seem to partly work on her.&#148;

&quot;She is the reason we came to get you.&quot; Alyson stated, returning her 
sword to its sheathe with a clank, &quot;I think she came from one of the 
mirrors that cut Kimberly.&quot; She knelt down next to Nicole and produced a 
handkerchief from her back pocket then dabbed at the girl&#39;s tears, &quot;You 
are safe now.&quot; 

Natalie crossed the room and scooped up her dagger off the floor, 
&quot;Mirrors? What are you talking about?&quot; She picked up her jacket from the 
back of a chair and returned the knife to one of the sleeves.

Alyson recalled to Natalie what herself and Nicole discovered in the 
washroom, &quot;She might actually be a part of Kim just like she claimed.&quot;

Natalie approached her sister, &quot;Sorry about that, kid. That was rather 
stupid of me.&quot; She said, only to have to girl cower into Alyson, &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong, Nicole?&quot; Natalie asked stunned by the girl&#39;s reaction to her. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; Alyson reassured the girl, &quot;Everything will be alright.&quot; 

Nicole glanced between the two girls, &quot;Aren&#39;t you still angry at sis?&quot; 
She asked Alyson, taking the handkerchief from the girl to blow her 
nose. 

Alyson stood up and gazed down the hall, &quot;We&#39;d better do something about 
this double,&quot; She stated, ignoring the question entirely, in turn 
causing Natalie to finch in pain, &quot;Before something bad really happens.&quot;

&quot;Like having your friend&#39;s reflection come to life is not bad enough.&quot; 
Natalie stated. 

&quot;What do you think will happen if that double meets up with the real 
Kim?&quot; Alyson posed, &quot;They say that it is bad for one to meet their 
double.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Natalie entered the hall and scanned them; &quot;You have 
any idea where she went? Or what we do when we catch her?&quot;

&quot;You know her the best, so I&#39;ll leave the catching up to you.&quot; Alyson 
patted the blonde on the shoulder, &quot;You think you can handle that?&quot; She 
asked Natalie.

&quot;Finding one sexually repressed and hormone driven Kimberly.&quot; Natalie 
sighed as she ran a hand through her hair, &quot;I think I can manage.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll see what I can find about Mirror ghosts or whatever this is.&quot; 
Alyson stated, gesturing to Nicole.

&quot;I get to help?&quot; Nicole asked instantly forgetting the events that just 
transpired. 

&quot;I&#39;ll need all the help I can get.&quot; Alyson explained, &quot;We need to search 
the school&#39;s library.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like such fun.&quot; Natalie said sarcastically, &quot;Glad I only have to 
catch a girl... who seems to be super fast.&quot; 

&quot;She is only an illusion of Kim so be careful.&quot; Alyson warned, &quot;and do 
not remove that pendant again. I didn&#39;t just give it to you for no 
reason.&quot; She straightened the pendant around Natalie&#39;s neck. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Natalie suddenly felt ashamed of herself for doubting 
Alyson and touched the crystal as it dangled against her chest, a smile 
crossing her face. 

&quot;You better hurry.&quot; Alyson said, &quot;Lunch time will be soon and it will be 
that much harder to find her double in a crowd of hungry girls.&quot; They 
hugged before heading off on their separate ways.
