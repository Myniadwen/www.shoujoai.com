Dear Dad,

Even though I haven&#39;t even been here for a week, things have been pretty 
hectic, and I haven&#39;t had time to rest. At first, I wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d 
fit in with the other players, or even the other students. You know, 
based on where I came from. As it turns out, I&#39;m not the only one who&#39;s 
led a hard life. In fact, after getting to know a few of the girls 
better, I consider myself fairly lucky. At least I had a good, strong 
fatherly role model to look up to, and even though I still resent mom a 
little, it wasn&#39;t like she was cruel to me. I don&#39;t have any physical or 
mental problems, and all things considered, I had a job and friends back 
home. I had my problems, but when I think about it, they weren&#39;t as 
severe as you&#39;d think. Many of the other players have it really rough. 
My roommate hasn&#39;t seen her mother in years, and for some reason, she 
really seems to hold a grudge towards her father (she&#39;s very private and 
uncommunicative, so it&#39;s hard getting her to open up). There&#39;s this one 
girl who just recently got out of an institution, and another with a 
life-threatening illness (I think). So many of the players are 
unemployed, and not many seem to have a lot of friends. Daddy, I love 
you, and I just want to say that I&#39;m glad I got you as a father.

All right, that&#39;s enough of the mushy stuff! I&#39;m really enjoying my time 
here, but I think I&#39;ll hold off on visiting you until things settle 
down. It was raining all this weekend, and it might not even stop 
tomorrow. So far, we have fourteen members on the team, counting myself 
and our self-appointed &quot;manager&quot;. Most of them are pretty good girls, 
but I don&#39;t know them very well. I think we&#39;ll start practicing in 
earnest once the weekend ends, so I may not have as much time as I&#39;d 
like. I&#39;d still love to hear from you, so please send me mail! I don&#39;t 
have an email account yet. Oh, and don&#39;t worry about our video games: 
two of the players are geeks just like you, dad. J

I&#39;d like to say one more thing before I end this letter. Awhile back, I 
used to hate mom for what she did. I felt like she betrayed and lied to 
us both, especially you. But lately, I&#39;ve slowly begun to understand her 
decision, and while I still think she did the wrong thing, I can forgive 
her and come to terms with everything. All this came about because I&#39;m 
more like her than I thought. I&#39;m a lesbian, dad. That&#39;s all I wanted to 
say. Please write soon.

With love, Kasumi.

 

&quot;Finished,&quot; she sighed, folding the letter and stuffing it in an 
envelope. She hesitated, though, staring numbly at the incomplete 
stationery and thinking about the revelation she had put on it. Her 
father knew a lot about her, but he didn&#39;t know everything. He didn&#39;t 
know...that. Then again, Kasumi herself had been unaware of it until 
recently, and she was trying to keep a firm hold of the situation. Her 
world had changed; she had crossed a significant border that opened up 
new problems as well as new possibilities.

&quot;Now if only I could send it,&quot; she murmured, taking the letter and 
hiding it.

 

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

 

&quot;Particulars&quot;

 

Dean Rosewood had the day off on Sunday, but she stepped into her office 
anyway to resolve some last-minute details she had been working on 
recently. Classes would start in three days, and she would need all that 
time to get caught up with her summer duties and prepare for the 
semester. Most of Carnegie was predictably empty, except for the gym and 
the fencing school, which were usually open all year long, but someone 
else was in the main office, going through his own final preparations: 
the Chairman. Rosewood silently tended to her stack of papers and 
folders, glancing over at her accomplice, wondering what he would 
connive. The room was quiet enough to hear the tick of a wrist-watch; 
neither of them spoke for hours, it seemed.

&quot;How&#39;s progress on your teams?&quot; he said flatly.

&quot;I haven&#39;t learned yet,&quot; Rosewood replied. Fitzgerald looked over at her 
placidly.

&quot;You don&#39;t know anything? They&#39;re your teams, Rosewood.&quot;

&quot;Not really. They&#39;re actually Bracton&#39;s and Leena&#39;s teams; I merely 
proposed their creation. I believe the men and women have sufficient 
players now, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be practicing outdoors anytime 
soon.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. Speaking of practice, Rosewood, if they really do have sufficient 
numbers, don&#39;t you think they should be tested?&quot;

&quot;Games don&#39;t start until summer, Fitzgerald.&quot;

&quot;I mean practice games, against other teams.&quot; His voice turned smooth 
and weasly, like a politician&#39;s, and although he did not smile, a 
playfulness tugged at his face, and his sea-grey eyes sparkled. &quot;I&#39;d 
like to measure the skill of your players against other teams- off the 
record, of course. I only think it&#39;s fair for the board to see how their 
investment is faring. Naturally, we&#39;d have to select people that are a 
strong and fair match for them. The board will only laugh at you if you 
can&#39;t offer your players a good challenge.&quot;

&quot;I completely agree,&quot; she stated, pursing her lips firmly. Fitzgerald 
was up to something- but what else was new?- and she would be forced to 
take the bait, since he had a legitimate point. She could still humor 
him, though, and turn his idea against him. &quot;But they have only just 
begun, and since I don&#39;t know very much about it, I don&#39;t know how 
skilled they might be.&quot;

&quot;All the more reason for these practice games,&quot; he replied calmly.

&quot;And since they&#39;re all so new,&quot; Rosewood resumed firmly, &quot;let&#39;s give 
them some time to prepare. I&#39;d say that two weeks after school starts, 
around the end of August or the beginning of September, we should begin 
the...assessment.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; he relented, &quot;but let&#39;s negotiate the terms of this test. 
I&#39;m not going to pretend I support or like these teams, and I feel that 
if the board believes they don&#39;t have the potential to stand as you 
envision, they should be disbanded before they embarrass the college.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying that if they lose these practice games, they should be 
eliminated in favor of your music program?&quot; Fitzgerald removed his 
glasses stoically and cleaned them. He stared into her eyes with a cold 
fire.

&quot;You have to agree that my feelings are justified, Rosewood. Think about 
it. If they cannot win a practice match, what hope do they have against 
the real thing?&quot;

&quot;I understand what you&#39;re saying,&quot; she murmured delicately, &quot;but we 
should treat this fairly. Let them have three games, or five, or however 
many you feel is necessary. If they win more games than they lose, they 
should stay. But if they cannot, I will agree to your proposal and 
revise my decision for the board. Of course, this will mean I will not 
have to resign, but I suppose a small victory is better than none at 
all.&quot;

&quot;Not a victory, Rosewood,&quot; he told her. &quot;Only a confirmation. Best two 
out of three will be satisfactory. I suggest you alert the Coaches of 
this new development once you are finished here. I shall be in the 
fencing school if you need to contact me. Good day.&quot;

&quot;And you.&quot; She took a relaxing breath once he left the office and smiled 
in spite of her anxiety. &quot;So now, we have finally begun. I hope you two 
can pull your people together- for your sake and mine.&quot;

 

- Arina Essylt, 19, Psychology major, team psychologist/reserve-

 

Kasumi was amazed at her religious devotion. She worked in a lesbian 
nightclub- and before that, a gay bar- she had indirectly came out of 
the closet, she had gotten into fights, she cursed, she had had sex with 
a stranger...and yet she kept up her church attendance, her prayers, and 
her studies, when she could. Kasumi had grown up United Methodist, and 
in all honesty, she felt like she was doing this out of habit. She had 
gone to church mechanically, stood and sat with the congregation, 
followed the words and listened to the sermons (she didn&#39;t sing), and 
even volunteered once in awhile. But now, as she woke up Sunday morning 
and ritually put on her best clothes, she wondered if she should 
continue her attendance now that daddy wasn&#39;t peering over her shoulder.

&quot;Do gay people even go to church?&quot; she wondered aloud as she combed her 
hair. She snorted. &quot;I don&#39;t even know what churches are around here. I&#39;m 
a total newcomer. Maybe I should just skip this week. I&#39;m not even sure 
why I keep going.&quot; Now that she thought about it, Kasumi felt like she 
had never fit in with her last church. Was it because of her growing 
homosexuality? Or maybe she felt too rough and coarse to attend. Church 
was for people who had nice clothes and clean faces, people who could 
afford to drive there, donate generously, and then go out to a 
restaurant later. Kasumi was very far removed from the ideal Christian, 
even though she still considered herself a devout believer, but she 
wanted to be honest with herself as well. She wasn&#39;t sure what to do.

&quot;Actually,&quot; she murmured as her thoughts changed gear, &quot;I did see that 
one place while I was moving in. I could at least check it out.&quot; She 
looked at herself in the mirror, a silly slum girl pretending to be a 
socialite, and undressed, choosing to represent herself in more 
comfortable attire. She already believed she wouldn&#39;t fit in, so why 
bother pretending? It would be better to come as she was and be truthful 
about herself, even if that truth was a little unattractive.

 

The rain from yesterday was still falling, although it had lost its 
strength. Kasumi was nearly tempted to go without her raincoat, but she 
didn&#39;t think this calm would last, so better safe than sorry. The church 
she had spotted was about a mile away- a decent exercise for her- and a 
good thing it was so close: her expectations were low and she didn&#39;t 
want to ride so far only to be disappointed. Kasumi was fairly 
waterlogged when she reached the parking lot and chained her bike, so 
she wandered around looking for a bathroom where she could dry off. Good 
thing she wasn&#39;t wearing her nice clothes.

As she expected, there wasn&#39;t much of a welcoming committee- in fact, 
there was hardly anybody wandering around, probably because service had 
started and Kasumi was late. She could already hear the congregation 
singing, so she just slipped inside and hid in one of the back rows, out 
of sight and out of mind. She elected not to stand when the others 
stood; she just sat there and judged the service carefully. One of her 
neighbors was a plump, balding man who sang and clapped boisterously, 
and the other was an elderly woman with a clear, joyful look on her 
face.

It turned out the speaker was nearing the end of a series of sermons; he 
was discussing the disciples&#39; letters to the early church, and had 
clumped the three letters of John together. It wasn&#39;t anything special, 
just standard fare, but there&#39;s something comforting about a preacher 
covering the basics. It made Kasumi feel less like a guest and more like 
a member. He spoke honestly and sincerely, without an axe to grind, and 
freely told jokes and anecdotes; she started to like him. Kasumi passed 
on donations and communion- she was a guest, after all.

When service let out, she was one of the first out the door. She 
gravitated towards the bulletin boards and searched for programs devoted 
to people her own age. Going to church wasn&#39;t completely habitual for 
her: she did have an ulterior motive for attending. Unfortunately, this 
church seemed to lag behind when it came to focusing on particular age 
groups: there was a children&#39;s ministry, middle and high school 
programs, men&#39;s and women&#39;s focus groups, and something for people over 
55, but nothing for that essential college and post-college age niche. 
Predictable. So maybe it wouldn&#39;t do any good for her to keep going 
here. Nobody seemed to notice her wandering around, wedging through the 
crowds as she headed for the door: newcomers must have been as invisible 
as God Himself.

&quot;Kasumi! Yo!&quot; She turned around, startled that somebody recognized her, 
and noticed one of her teammates standing there smiling. If memory 
served...

&quot;Um...Sharon, right?&quot;

&quot;Shannon,&quot; she corrected. &quot;Close enough. Do you go heah?&quot;

&quot;Um, no, I&#39;m just visiting.&quot;

&quot;Ah. I come heah every once in awhile to visit some pals. I ain&#39;t 
Protestant or nothin&#39;, but Christ is Christ, right?&quot;

&quot;I guess so. So you&#39;re...Catholic?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s this Catholic church neahby I usually go to. Say, if you 
ain&#39;t a membah, why don&#39;t you come to service with me next week?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you,&quot; Kasumi replied warmly. &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to 
see what a Catholic mass was like. Um, would it be okay if I came?&quot;

&quot;Sure, guests are welcome. So are you like religious, or just curious?&quot;

&quot;No, I went to church regularly back in DC with my dad. I&#39;ve been kind 
of lost ever since moving.&quot;

&quot;I know just how ya feel,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;Say, it&#39;s freakin&#39; noisy in 
heah. Let&#39;s go outside and see if the rain&#39;s stopped. Did you drive 
heah?&quot;

&quot;No, I took a bike.&quot;

&quot;Wow, in the rain?&quot; Kasumi silently picked up her raincoat from the rack 
and put it on. Shannon looked smug as she grabbed her umbrella. &quot;Ah, I 
get it. You live neahby?&quot;

&quot;About a mile away. You?&quot;

&quot;Close enough to walk in the rain. You wanna come ovah to my place and 
watch the baseball game?&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure, that sounds nice. I&#39;m not really into baseball, but...what 
the heck! Should we pick up something to eat first?&quot;

&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll cook. I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Kasumi smiled warmly as she followed 
Shannon back to her house. She hadn&#39;t expected to have such a turn of 
good fortune that day, but who can really tell what the day might bring? 
She had been so close to missing out on making a new friend! The rain 
was starting to really come down by the time they arrived at the double, 
so Shannon had to change her clothes; Kasumi just settled for a towel 
and dried off.

&quot;Can I ask you a question?&quot; she said as she peered around Shannon&#39;s 
place. It was bigger than Kasumi&#39;s, but she didn&#39;t have a roommate yet, 
and alarmingly messy, even for a tomboy.

&quot;Go ahead.&quot;

&quot;Why are you being so nice to me? We barely know each other.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re on the same team, ain&#39;t we? I heah you&#39;re pretty good, and I 
ain&#39;t so shabby myself. Besides, I don&#39;t have that many pals, and I 
figya we bettah get acquainted eventually. Ha...maybe I shoulda just 
told you it was my &#39;religious obligation&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough. So what&#39;s for lunch?&quot;

&quot;Vindaloo curry. It&#39;s perfect for rainy weathah. My papa bought me some 
beer, but there&#39;s prob&#39;ly enough V8 to go around.&quot; Shannon came out of 
her room wearing jeans and an orange T-shirt, padding barefoot to the 
cupboards as she turned the television on. &quot;Make yahself at home,&quot; she 
offered. &quot;Cups are up theah.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. You&#39;re very nice.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d do the same for me,&quot; she smiled. Kasumi blushed and looked away. 
Shannon had that charming good-time gal personality, a fine build and 
weight for her age, and blond hair bouncing in a ponytail. Her chest was 
small but sufficient, and she had a bruise on her nose that hinted at 
how rough-and-tumble she was. All in all, a beautiful, down-home lady 
that could wrestle you as soon as hug you. Odds were good that Shannon 
wasn&#39;t interested in a same-sex relationship, but Kasumi had to be sure. 
She was a churchgoing lesbian, right?

&quot;Uh, Shannon, there&#39;s something you should know about me before you get 
any...deeper acquainted.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Well, I...&quot; She sighed. She had never openly proclaimed her sexuality 
to another person. She was starting to wonder if writing it in a letter 
even counted. &quot;I don&#39;t want to scare you away, but I have to be honest 
and...tell you that I came out recently.&quot;

&quot;You mean outta the closet?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; she replied meekly. &quot;I hope that doesn&#39;t bother you.&quot; 
Shannon shrugged carelessly.

&quot;Meh. I figured at least one gal on the team would be gay. They was all 
ovah the place back at my old school. I&#39;ve had a few bad experiences, 
but as long as you don&#39;t wave it in my face or make a pass at me, theah 
shouldn&#39;t be no problem.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good, okay. No, I&#39;m not like that. I&#39;m actually pretty nervous 
about it.&quot; Shannon reappeared in the den, throwing a feeble smile.

&quot;Then I guess we ain&#39;t gonna have any problems. I mean, I ain&#39;t a total 
homophobe; I just feel a little uncomf&#39;table cuz&#39; of my bad experience. 
I kissed a girl once, but it was freakin&#39; repulsive, and I only did it 
so she&#39;d tell me about some damned intahview she got. Puh, guess wheah 
that got me! Eww, I hated her- but you seem all right! Still, I don&#39;t 
see how you gals can do that. Guys are much bettah.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple...and I&#39;ve known a lot of guys, gay or not, who 
were total pigs. But I guess that applies to women as well.&quot;

&quot;Ain&#39;t that the biblical truth,&quot; Shannon commented. She presented Kasumi 
with a plate of vindaloo curry and a beer, and they sat down to watch 
the ball game. Shannon quickly turned into a diehard fanatic, yelling 
and cheering at the TV, leaving Kasumi to sit in surprise and boredom. 
She didn&#39;t understand baseball (or most sports, for that matter, besides 
boxing and soccer), but she was polite enough to keep Shannon company. 
It was the least she could do after her host had been so generous.

 

- Jen Andre, 20, Computer science major, defensive midfielder-

 

The soccer field was closed due to the weather, but the gym was still 
open, albeit sparsely populated. Fausta, Alice, Felicity, Jen, Freya, 
and Arina were the only ones there, besides Leena and Kathlyn; everyone 
else was either at work, at church, or somewhere else, away from the 
rain. Leena didn&#39;t begrudge them their absence since training hadn&#39;t 
officially started yet, but she had been hoping for a bigger turnout. It 
soon became clear that nobody else would be signing up for soccer: it 
had been a fad that came and went, but at least they had a team of 
sorts.

&quot;Well, I suppose that if nobody else comes in today, then you&#39;re free to 
come and go as you please,&quot; Leena announced. &quot;But from Tuesday on, we&#39;ll 
be practicing and training together, and you&#39;ll each have to hold the 
other accountable for her attendance. I understand there are 
emergencies, and stuff happens that we can&#39;t prevent, but there&#39;s no 
excuse for slacking off. Remember, nobody forced you on this team, so 
the least you can do is show up. Make sure everyone else understands 
this. Oh, one more thing before I leave you to your work: this gym is 
open twenty-four hours a day, and while we&#39;ll be using it whenever we 
can&#39;t access the field, it&#39;s not ours. If you borrow something, put it 
back. If you make a mess, clean it up. We&#39;re all adults here; we can 
behave as such. All right, enough of my buzz-killing. Go have some fun.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not children,&quot; Fausta grumbled as she started jogging around the 
gym. She chose Felicity as a partner, because she admired her singular 
drive and focus.

&quot;Not most of us, anyway,&quot; she answered. Fausta grinned at her.

&quot;So you noticed it too, huh? Lauren&#39;s a real slacker. If she had such a 
lackadaisical attitude, she shouldn&#39;t have even bothered signing up.&quot; 
They vaulted up a flight of stairs and ran around the upper bleachers. 
Right now they were on a walking track that circled a basketball court; 
there was also a weight room, locker and shower areas for both genders, 
a cardio room, and a small lounge with snack machines and a television. 
It was a fairly nice gym for its size.

Alice, meanwhile, wandered around looking for a place where she could 
work out in private. Her therapist had recommended an exercise program 
for her, but she didn&#39;t feel like socializing yet; she just wanted to 
focus on something without being bothered by others. Freya chatted with 
Arina while Jen ran laps around the court, and since Felicity and Fausta 
were on the track, that left the weight room completely free. She headed 
there but stopped as she saw two strangers coming through the door, 
heading towards Leena.

&quot;Now what could this be?&quot; she wondered. She walked closer and pricked 
her ears up, insatiably curious. She heard scraps of their conversation; 
in its full length, it went as follows:

&quot;Hi there, how are you? Ungodly weather we&#39;re having. Is this the place 
where I can sign up for the new sports team?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes... So you wanted to try out?&quot;

&quot;I believe that was already implied. So what is it that I have to do to 
get on? I don&#39;t have any medical records with me, but I&#39;m in perfectly 
good shape, as you can see.&quot; Alice watched as the woman leaned over, 
exposing her cleavage, smiling slickly as she stared at Leena&#39;s face. 
She didn&#39;t think the Coach would fall for such a cheap trick- in fact, 
she wondered what the younger woman was thinking.

&quot;Well, your shape isn&#39;t important,&quot; Leena relied, keeping her gaze 
steady. &quot;Let me see your footwork, Miss...uh...&quot;

&quot;Fleur Lacroix. F-L-E-U-R, L-A-C-R-O-I-X, pronounced &#39;la-CROY&#39;. So do 
you have the balls around here?&quot;

&quot;The ball cage is over here!&quot; Freya exclaimed, waving her arm and 
ignoring Fleur&#39;s double entendre. Fleur raised her eyebrow and smirked.

&quot;So it is. If you&#39;ll excuse me, Miss Coach. Do keep a sharp eye out. Oh, 
this lady here is Rain. She came to offer her support for me. Wasn&#39;t 
that sweet of her?&quot; Rain copied Fleur&#39;s nihilistic smirk, waved, and sat 
down in the bleachers, watching as her friend proved her worth. When she 
got bored, she glanced over at the attractive blonde near the ball cage, 
or the girls running laps around the track, until she finally focused on 
the tall woman lumbering into the weight room. It was rare for Rain to 
see girls that towered over her (or even guys), so she was naturally 
drawn to this one, and followed her inside, giving Fleur&#39;s performance 
one final glimpse.

&quot;She&#39;ll definitely get in,&quot; she said to herself. Alice was on a 
treadmill, her shoes off, a barbell in each hand, walking at a steady 
pace. She glanced over to see who was coming in, then resumed her 
activities. One visitor probably wouldn&#39;t create much of a disturbance.

&quot;Are you on the team?&quot; Rain said. Alice nodded.

&quot;Uhuh.&quot;

&quot;Any athletic experience?&quot;

&quot;None at all,&quot; she gasped faintly. Rain frowned.

&quot;Then how the hell did you pass the screening process?&quot;

&quot;Uh, my therapist got me in. He said that exercise would help.&quot;

Introduce yourself, you clumsy giraffe! It&#39;s time to start opening up!

&quot;I&#39;m Alice, by the way,&quot; she announced stiffly. &quot;You know, like Alice 
and the mad tea party. I took a growth potion and it worked a little too 
well. Now all I need is a Queen of Hearts and a caterpillar smoking a 
hookah.&quot; She blushed and sped up. Alice hadn&#39;t meant to let all that 
spill out. She wasn&#39;t used to an audience.

&quot;Hmm, really. Well, I&#39;m Rain, and I&#39;m outside smacking myself against 
the building.&quot; Both girls grinned and relaxed; it was nice being in the 
presence of another weirdo. &quot;You said your therapist brought you here. 
Was this like a physical therapist, or...&quot;

&quot;No, I...just...lost my marbles,&quot; Alice said, sighing grimly. It was 
difficult to talk about, so she chose every word carefully.

&quot;I know what that&#39;s like,&quot; Rain grumbled. &quot;I&#39;ve got OCD and a form of 
dyslexia, plus some other...issues and complexes. My therapist 
recommended sports as well.&quot;

&quot;So are you signing up with your friend?&quot;

&quot;I should,&quot; she laughed, &quot;but no, I&#39;m with the fencing team. You know, 
Chairman Fitzgerald&#39;s group. I only say I should to give him a shock, 
but I really won&#39;t. Sorry to disappoint you.&quot;

&quot;No hard feelings. We barely know each other.&quot; She stopped the treadmill 
and put her weights down so she could get a drink of water. &quot;I&#39;m 
supposed to be paranoid and schizophrenic.&quot;

&quot;We have so much in common,&quot; Rain drawled comically. Alice grinned.

&quot;Yeah, really.&quot;

Now ask her out on a date. You&#39;ve got nothing to lose.

&quot;Just out of curiosity,&quot; Rain said, &quot;what do you think of the team?&quot;

&quot;Uhh, I&#39;m not sure. I&#39;m pretty new, and I still don&#39;t know anybody.&quot;

&quot;Do you think it stands a chance?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t know what that means,&quot; Alice said, shaking her head. Rain 
shrugged smugly.

&quot;Oh well, never mind. It&#39;s just that Chairman Fitzgerald was against it 
from the beginning, or so I hear him muttering. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s not 
your fault. He&#39;s entitled to his beliefs, as selfish as they are. 
Anyway, I&#39;d better get back to see how my friend made out...and I don&#39;t 
just mean with the try-out.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Alice felt lost; she didn&#39;t know what that meant either. She 
decided to buck up and put her heart on the line. &quot;Uh, say, are you 
like, free on Monday or something? I mean, if you&#39;d like to hang out...&quot;

&quot;Sure, but I&#39;ve got practice later on. Well, maybe you can come watch, 
if you want. Fencing isn&#39;t really like the movies, but it&#39;s better than 
sitting at home, staring at the wallpaper.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d know about that,&quot; Alice murmured.

&quot;We both would,&quot; Rain grinned. &quot;So I guess it&#39;s a date.&quot;

&quot;A date?&quot; Rain laughed at her expression.

&quot;Yeah, I date girls now and then. Is that a problem?&quot;

&quot;N-not for me,&quot; she stammered. Rain grinned and saluted.

&quot;All right then, see you tomorrow. Oh- when and where?&quot;

&quot;Uhh...I don&#39;t know this place very well. Anywhere is fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not familiar either. Do you know where Parody Bookstore is?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Meet me there at nine tomorrow morning. I&#39;ll treat you to breakfast if 
you&#39;ll treat me to lunch.&quot;

&quot;Okay! See you then!&quot;

&quot;Take care until then,&quot; Rain said as she turned back and waved. To 
celebrate Fleur&#39;s initiation into the soccer team, she fucked her pretty 
nihilistic brains out.

Since Fausta took the day off to squeeze in some extra practice, Robin 
had to call Terra in to fill up the weekend shift, and since it was 
Sunday, the place was packed and they were frantically trying to 
maintain order. Terra panicked for awhile as the swarm of &quot;weekenders&quot; 
clogged the small bookstore, and started to worry about inventory and 
registering all these orders. She and Robin both had to man a cash 
register for three hours straight; Robin left her when she thought a 
lull had settled to call Fausta and beg for her assistance.

&quot;Look, I know you asked for the day off, but I&#39;ll pay you time and a 
half. We really need you here, Fausta.&quot;

&quot;Well...I&#39;ll think about it before I wrap up. I&#39;ll have to take a shower 
and drive all the way over.&quot;

&quot;Fine, get here when you can. Do you promise you&#39;ll be here?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have any other plans today,&quot; she mumbled, &quot;and I do need the 
money. I&#39;ll be there, but I won&#39;t make a habit out of coming on my days 
off.&quot;

&quot;All right, fine. I&#39;ll see if I can hire some extra help. Thanks.&quot; She 
hung up and rushed over to check on Terra. The poor girl had to face a 
long line of impatient customers all by herself, and several shelves 
badly needed to be restocked. There was also a small mess that needed to 
be cleaned, and order forms to fill out. Robin dashed to the next cash 
register and declared she was open; the line evened out and the two 
entrenched themselves once again.

&quot;Is it usually this busy?&quot; Terra asked breathlessly. She had long ago 
given up trying to devote herself to every customer&#39;s needs: there was 
no way she could last at that pace. Now she was just trying to scan 
their items and get them out, and only a few were cooperative and 
considerate enough to help move things along.

&quot;Just on weekends. It was raining harder yesterday, which is why we 
didn&#39;t get too many people. Things should pick up once the last of the 
students arrive.&quot;

&quot;I noticed that. So tell me more about these game tournaments. Uh, 
thanks, have a nice day!&quot;

&quot;I usually hold them every Wednesday night, but the serious tournaments 
are on the second Sunday every month, once the store closes.&quot;

&quot;Oh, great. Uh, does a woman named Jennifer Andre ever come by here?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s a regular. Do you know her?&quot;

&quot;Just from online games,&quot; Terra grinned. &quot;We&#39;re on the same team, 
though, so I guess we&#39;ll get to know the real-life versions of each 
other.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never played any online games. Are they any fun?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not exactly an authority. I could only afford the free ones. So how 
did you and Gardenia meet?&quot;

&quot;Must we talk about that slacker?&quot; Robin smiled. &quot;I was just about to 
say that it must be really busy over there, or else she would&#39;ve dropped 
on by to annoy me. Don&#39;t let my description fool you,&quot; she giggled; &quot;I 
really love that woman. She&#39;s my best friend. My life would be so dull 
without her. And I&#39;m just as guilty of playing hooky and visiting her. 
We met about...oh, five or six years ago, I think, before Carnegie was 
here. I had just bought this property and turned it into a bookstore, 
and she was one of my customers that day. We didn&#39;t really get to 
talking until a month later, when I first started those game 
tournaments. She asked if I&#39;d like to watch a few movies over at her 
club, so I said yes, and we&#39;ve been friends ever since. It&#39;s hard to 
believe that she&#39;s rich.&quot;

&quot;Rich? Like, how rich?&quot;

&quot;She owns the Lily Club,&quot; Robin shrugged. &quot;Dee doesn&#39;t talk about her 
money. It&#39;s embarrassing. She does pretty well for herself, and I do 
too. So tell me about yourself, Terra.&quot;

&quot;What do you want to know?&quot; Robin delayed her response as the door 
opened.

&quot;Hey, here she comes to save the day!&quot; She sang out for joy as Fausta 
walked through and clocked in. She hastily tapped the water from her 
umbrella and went straight to work.

&quot;So what do you need me to do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got the register, so could you please handle stocking and 
inventory?&quot;

&quot;All right. I&#39;ll go clean that mess, too, while I&#39;m at it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, you&#39;re a lifesaver.&quot; Robin&#39;s shoulders relaxed and the tension 
left her face; she was herself again. &quot;Okay, that makes me feel better. 
So where were we?&quot;

&quot;My life story. Is it okay to talk while all these people are here? I 
mean, shouldn&#39;t we concentrate?&quot;

&quot;I can talk and work at the same time. Dee and I chatter all the time 
whenever she comes over. So what do you like to do, besides gaming?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I&#39;ve gotten into amateur game development, and I&#39;m even 
making an RPG webcomic. I&#39;m also heavily into Tae Kwon Do and Battodo- 
that&#39;s sort of like kendo. I read and draw manga, and I really love 
anime, but I usually steer clear of the mainstream crap like Naruto.&quot;

&quot;Do you like Revolutionary Girl Utena?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of it.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s an older series. Dee&#39;s decided to show the movie for her 
next Saturday matinee, so why don&#39;t you check it out? It&#39;s a bizarre 
film, but really great.&quot;

&quot;Sure. What other series have you seen?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Noir, Strawberry Panic, dot hack/Sign- Eva and Sailor Moon, of 
course- Mai Hime, Macross, Read Or Die, Love Hina, Bubblegum Crisis- 
that&#39;s my favorite along with Utena.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, you&#39;re a real aficionada. Do you think I could borrow a few of 
those?&quot;

&quot;Sure, as long as you promise to give them back. I don&#39;t have any manga, 
though, but considering where I work, I don&#39;t think I need it.&quot; Terra 
chuckled and felt herself loosening, even though the rush was still in 
full swing. She definitely felt lucky for landing such an awesome job, 
and getting such a cool boss.

&quot;What about your family?&quot; Robin asked. Terra frowned and intently 
focused on her work.

&quot;I don&#39;t like talking about them. They were nothing but dictators all my 
life. They kept me in a cage and forced me to play along with their 
outdated beliefs. They didn&#39;t even want me working, for crying out loud- 
they were probably hoping I&#39;d just marry some rich guy and pop out 
grandkids. Now you have to tell me about yours.&quot;

&quot;I only wish they were that colorful,&quot; Robin lamented dryly. &quot;Suffice to 
say that they were as banal as a phonebook. My father&#39;s a nine-to-fiver 
in a gray little office and my mother&#39;s a homemaker. They&#39;re about as 
traditional as they come. We never had any problems and we never worried 
about money, but it was the emptiest existence you could ever imagine. I 
can&#39;t count the number of times I ran away from home.&quot; Terra laughed and 
felt a little better for having (and conquering) such an oppressive 
childhood, and together, she and her boss weathered the storm. The 
action didn&#39;t really slow down until around 7:00 that night, just two 
hours before the store closed. By that time, the rain had ended and the 
clouds were unfolding, but it was still wet and muggy outside. Robin and 
Terra went to the basement for an extended break, leaving Fausta to care 
for the shop until they got back.

&quot;You did well for your first weekend rush,&quot; she complimented. &quot;I was 
glad to see you relaxing after awhile. That&#39;s the key to handling big 
crowds: just keep your cool and keep moving.&quot;

&quot;Well, I have lots of martial arts training, so that helped,&quot; Terra 
replied humbly.

&quot;It shows. You have good discipline, and you&#39;re pretty strong for your 
size. Also, even though it was a futile gesture, I appreciate you trying 
to devote some time to every customer. They may seem like total 
dictators, but your parents raised you well.&quot; Terra cringed and made a 
face.

&quot;Please don&#39;t talk about them anymore.&quot; Robin grinned apologetically.

&quot;Sorry. I guess this is a case of the pot calling the kettle black, huh? 
So do your classes start on Wednesday?&quot;

&quot;Yep. I&#39;ve got two days left after today.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any plans?&quot; Terra shook her head. Besides soccer practice 
and official orientation, her schedule was wide open. &quot;Ah. I&#39;m asking 
because I&#39;d like to take you out on a date.&quot;

&quot;Um...excuse me?&quot; Her face turned red and she stiffened. Nobody had ever 
been this direct with her before, not even Mayu. And besides, there was 
also...

&quot;Yeah, a date. Haven&#39;t you ever been on a date before?&quot; She shook her 
head.

&quot;Not with another woman...and not with my boss!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think of it that way!&quot; Robin laughed. &quot;Fausta and I dated a bit 
before you came here. I just want to go out and have some fun. I promise 
I won&#39;t do anything strange, and I promise you&#39;ll see me as just another 
ordinary person before it&#39;s over.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so it&#39;s just like something a couple of friends would do.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; she gestured, &quot;but I wouldn&#39;t mind having you for my 
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Uh...so you&#39;re...um...&quot;

&quot;Gay and proud of it!&quot; she beamed. &quot;I&#39;m just not as...flagrant about it 
as Dee is.&quot;

&quot;Oh. You know, I thought you two might have been...uh, you know.&quot;

&quot;A couple? We are. But we&#39;re not married, Terra: we do date other 
people, and we&#39;re totally cool with it. I mean, if you have a problem- &quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; she stammered, &quot;I&#39;m not a homophobe or anything! I don&#39;t have 
any problems! I think I might actually be bisexual!&quot;

Whoops, talk about letting the cat out the bag. Well, you had to say it 
eventually, Thuy. That kiss Mayu gave you helped open up a whole new 
world.

&quot;Then there aren&#39;t any problems!&quot; Robin said, grinning sweetly. &quot;I mean, 
unless you have issues with older women. You&#39;re nineteen, right? Seven 
years is not too bad.&quot;

&quot;You mean you&#39;re only twenty-six and you own your own business?&quot; Robin 
nodded, leaving Terra deeply impressed with her employer. She ultimately 
decided to accept her offer, if only to say later that she had indeed 
dated another woman. She would worry about the particulars of her 
situation later.
