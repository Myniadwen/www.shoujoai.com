Relieved that school was out for the holiday, Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon had 
Lilian Nachtheim to herself for exactly seven minutes and fourteen 
seconds before her father, a professional chef, called for her to come 
into the kitchen and help with the Thanksgiving meal. She gave her 
girlfriend a sad smile and excused herself; Lilian wondered if there was 
anything she could do.

&quot;Just greet the guests as they come,&quot; she said, cupping her cheek. They 
exchanged a firm kiss farewell, and went down their own paths. In the 
time she had known and loved Gabrielle, Lilian had become acquainted 
with her four close friends. She knew each of them fairly well, having 
studied them in Miss Madsen&#39;s class, and so wasn&#39;t quite as shy as she 
had been during the first month of the year. She expected eight 
additional people to attend Thanksgiving dinner&#151;Gabrielle&#39;s friends and 
usually their girlfriends&#151;so she summoned up her best posture, practiced 
formality in her spare time, and stood by the door, dressed in autumnal 
regalia, to wait for the guests.

Meanwhile, Gabrielle was forced to work demeaning jobs. Her father 
usually asked to be left alone when he made meals, but Thanksgiving was 
a huge event, too much for him to handle, and so the O&#39;Shannon women 
were hired as his gofers and assistants. Poor Gabrielle, who knew next 
to nothing about cooking, was given the simpler jobs that didn&#39;t require 
much in the way of work. Even then she was usually in the way.

A knock at the door stirred Lilian from her daydreaming. She smoothed 
out her sweater and opened the door, smiling broadly as she welcomed the 
first guests, Janine and Victoria. May and June came right behind 
them&#151;they had been invited because of their close connections with the 
group, and since the Tramble parents were going out of town for the 
holidays, they allowed their daughters to stay with their friends. 
Lilian hugged Janine, Victoria, and May (all of whom she knew well 
enough to consider them friends), and squeezed June&#39;s hand.

&quot;Sorry I can&#39;t entertain you all,&quot; she said. &quot;I was asked to tell you to 
make yourselves comfortable. Gabrielle is in the kitchen.&quot;

&quot;Uh-oh.&quot; Janine gave Vicki a grim look. &quot;Those are words that should 
never be strung together in a sentence.&quot;

&quot;The poor girl can barely make Ramen noodles,&quot; murmured Vicki, blushing 
when she realized what she had said. Another knock jarred Lilian from 
the foursome, so she attended the door and found Olivia standing on the 
other side, looking bored and lonely. They embraced and spoke for awhile 
as Johnson came in from the frosty November air. It had been a tough 
month&#151;Yuki Kogure had done her fair share of meddling and frankly Olivia 
was sick of it&#151;and Ayanna had gone all pathetic on her by begging to be 
allowed to go with her.

&quot;What for?&quot; asked Lilian. Johnson parted her hair nonchalantly.

&quot;Let&#39;s just say that my auntie isn&#39;t one to tolerate Ayanna&#39;s sexual 
preference.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Did you take her with you?&quot;

&quot;No, her girlfriend&#39;s family invited her. Nice group of people. Am I the 
first to arrive?&quot;

&quot;No, more like the fifth. I guess everyone&#39;s in the den.&quot;

&quot;All right, thanks.&quot; She smiled faintly and went off to join them. 
Lilian could identify with exclusivity to a degree&#151;her own home life 
wasn&#39;t exactly joyful&#151;so Ayanna&#39;s distress was a familiar story. She sat 
down and took a rest, overhearing some of the more colorful 
conversations coming from the kitchen. She yearned to take Gabrielle in 
her arms, even for a moment, but that could wait for later. Another 
visitor was at the door.

&quot;Guten tag!&quot; she greeted happily, seeing the last of the guests. Blake, 
Mira, and Usha each greeted her and came inside, shucking off jackets 
and shoes. Blake looked completely drugged up and happy; Mira set about 
exploring the oversized O&#39;Shannon house; Usha introduced herself to her 
hostess&#39; parents.

&quot;A fine afternoon, soon to be evening to you all,&quot; she said, poking her 
head in the kitchen. Gabrielle&#39;s father just waved.

&quot;Hey.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; said her mother. &quot;Blake&#39;s girlfriend, right? I&#39;ve heard about 
you&#151;umm, Usha, is it?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; Gabrielle&#39;s mother smiled, and told the young girl to make 
herself at home. Lilian was the host until somebody was freed from the 
kitchen; Usha bowed and left the family to their devices. She caught 
Blake still in the greeting room, chatting with Janine and Olivia.

&quot;Have either of you seen Mira? I saw her wandering off and thought...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Blake assured her. She gestured to Olivia and 
said, &quot;We&#39;ve been friends of each other&#39;s families for years. We&#39;ve all 
been up, down, and around each other&#39;s houses, so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re 
unwelcome to explore. She&#39;ll join us when she&#39;s ready.&quot; She kissed 
Krishnan&#39;s forehead and went about talking to Olivia. Usha took her 
girlfriend&#39;s words and went with them to the den, where she greeted 
everyone and went into socialization mode.

Lilian did her best to entertain the girls, but she was out of her 
element in spite of growing up in the nobility. She ultimately let 
television do the work, and turned on the football game. She wasn&#39;t a 
big fan of sports, but it provided an earthly distraction and let her 
rest and wait for announcements from the kitchen. Gabrielle was granted 
a break to socialize, and came into the family room with a shout and a 
smile. The others greeted her in turn, some hugging or kissing. She 
grinned and clutched onto Lilian.

&quot;Saints alive, it&#39;s been awhile since we were all together under the 
same roof! When was it last, the night before school?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but none of us had girlfriends,&quot; noted Vicki. And now, she 
implied, we do. Or some of us.

&quot;Some still don&#39;t, you know,&quot; said Janine. &quot;And prefer it that way.&quot; 
Vicki grinned.

&quot;What about May? Isn&#39;t she your&#151;&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Vicki winced.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m sorry. I just assumed...&quot;

&quot;You know what happens when you assume, right?&quot; And all together, the 
girls called out, &quot;You make an ASS out of U and ME.&quot; May whistled.

&quot;We&#39;re really not...&quot;

&quot;Okay, enough fightin&#39;,&quot; said O&#39;Shannon, giving her girlfriend another 
squeeze. &quot;We didn&#39;t come here to squabble or tease Janine about her 
girlfriends.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; said Blake. Most of the girls snickered.

&quot;No, we came to be together, to give thanks for what we&#39;ve got, and to 
spend a few well-earned days away from school, good as it&#39;s been to all 
of us. You know, all that holiday bunk.&quot;

&quot;I assume&#151;excuse me,&quot; said Olivia with a smile, &quot;I believe that nobody 
will attempt to make a pig out of themselves this year?&quot;

&quot;Oh, like you did last year?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t make a pig out of myself!&quot;

&quot;Ya had three helpin&#39;s! I couldn&#39;t get me hands on the stuffin&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Only because your father makes everything wonderful.&quot;

&quot;Aye, true that. Ya shoulda been here, Lil, ya really should,&quot; she said 
to her girlfriend. &quot;Wonderful time had by all, really wonderful. Liv 
hogged the stuffin&#39;, Vicki got herself a snifter of wine papa let us 
drink&#151;and got freaky drunk, might I add?&quot;

&quot;Hey, you were as tipsy as any of us!&quot; she squeaked defensively. 
Gabrielle&#39;s shiny smile was too powerful for her; she gave Lilian 
another friendly jab and continued.

&quot;Blake forgot her meds, so that was fun. Me girlfriend back then was 
whinin&#39; her head off and I was gettin&#39; sick of it&#151;lots o&#39; stuff 
happenin&#39;. I think Jeanie here was the only one acting normal.&quot;

&quot;I took a nap,&quot; she explained. Lilian nodded her head. One could hear 
footsteps on the stairs, indicating Mira&#39;s return to the first floor. 
She came back smiling, her hands behind her back, and deliberately 
bumped into Usha so she could catch the girl in her arms and sneak a 
kiss. Blake grinned.

&quot;Well somebody&#39;s feeling playful.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Gabrielle has a big house! Why so large for such a small family?&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t tell you while you were assigned to each other?&quot; Mira 
shrugged.

&quot;Never came up.&quot;

&quot;Well, Mr. and Mrs. S were expecting a large family, since they both 
came from large families, so they bought this great big old house. But 
Gabrielle was their only child&#151;I guess genetics play strange tricks on 
us. Anyway, they have all these spare rooms now, so whenever we all need 
to go over and have a group study session or whatever, we&#39;re usually 
welcome here. Sometimes Vick or Jean&#39;s families hosts holiday things, 
but Gab&#39;s dad does Thanksgiving.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s okay? He doesn&#39;t mind cooking all that much?&quot;

&quot;What can I say, the man loves it. He usually takes leftovers to this 
homeless place; sometimes he stays there awhile and makes em&#39; dinner.&quot; 
Mira smiled and made herself busy in the family room. She plopped down 
wherever there was a free space and asked both her girlfriends to join 
her. Blake was probably the only girl among them who genuinely liked 
football (maybe Janine too); the others tolerated it and exchanged bits 
of gossip when they could. Once Mr. O&#39;Shannon felt that his daughter had 
worked enough, he let her go socialize with everyone else.

&quot;Usha, Mira,&quot; said Victoria during one forgettable commercial, &quot;do you 
think your parents would mind you staying here the night? We usually 
spend the evening here anyway; it&#39;s a sort of Thanksgiving tradition. I 
mean, if you can&#39;t, it&#39;s okay. There&#39;s more than enough beds.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I did not think about that. Let me call.&quot; Gabrielle led Mira off to 
the phone; Usha called her parents via cellular connection (May and June 
were also staying since their parents were out of town; the Nachtheims 
didn&#39;t seem to mind their daughter&#39;s lengthy absence either). While they 
were off, Blake called Lilian over in private, wanting to speak with 
her.

&quot;So, how&#39;s life with the Irish kid? You two doing okay?&quot; She mutely 
nodded her head. &quot;That&#39;s good. So like, how do you two, you know, 
coexist? I mean, I love Gabrielle to death, but she can be a pain in the 
ass sometimes. She hardly ever stops talking and she&#39;s so...hyperactive. 
I mean, I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m any better; she just gets on our nerves.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot; Blake crossed her arms.

&quot;Mostly these days, she talks about you,&quot; she said quietly. Lilian 
smiled shyly. &quot;When she does, she gets all dreamy and starry-eyed. She&#39;s 
got it bad for you, Lil. She&#39;s really into you. Can&#39;t say I blame her. 
From what I learned when we were together that week, you seem just her 
type. She needs a sensible and sensitive girl around her, somebody who 
doesn&#39;t mind her quirks.&quot;

&quot;I think they&#39;re really sweet, her quirks.&quot; Blake smiled.

&quot;I guess, sometimes. Anyway, I hope it works out for you two, I mean it. 
I&#39;ve known Gab and Jean longer than anyone, even Liv and Vick, so we all 
go way, way back. Don&#39;t do anything to upset her.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I trust you.&quot; Blake pulled her in for a hug and whispered, &quot;You be good 
to her. It&#39;s about time that girl found someone right for her.&quot; Lilian 
snickered and promised she would do her best, and then tried prying into 
Blake&#39;s life.

&quot;So how is it, may I ask, that you can have two girlfriends? Isn&#39;t it a 
lot of stress? Isn&#39;t it awkward?&quot;

&quot;Sometimes,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Mira and Usha...one minute they&#39;re fighting, 
the next they can&#39;t take their hands off each other. Mira can really be 
nasty if she&#39;s in a bad mood, and Usha can be such a stuck-up cunt 
sometimes. I say that out of love, so don&#39;t get me wrong. I honestly 
think I&#39;m the most wacko out of all of them.&quot;

&quot;Because of your disorder?&quot; she said with a grin.

&quot;Yeah, that and all those damn pills. Plus, you know, my mother&#39;s not 
exactly hot with the whole deal. Dad could care less, as long as I bring 
in good grades, but it&#39;s really awful sometimes bringing two girlfriends 
to the dinner table.&quot; Lilian made a face, glad that she wasn&#39;t in that 
sort of predicament. Sure, Blake deserved to be loved, but it seemed 
things would continue to be tough for her, even in the best situations.

&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t feel right about leaving one for the other?&quot;

&quot;No, not at all. I can honestly say that I&#39;ve fallen in love with them 
both.&quot;

&quot;What a pleasant thing to say!&quot; Blake suddenly felt gentle arms embrace 
her from behind, and turned around only to see Miss Krishnan, who had 
overheard part of the conversation. &quot;Hey soccer girl. Are you saying 
good things about me behind my back?&quot;

&quot;Umm...yes.&quot; Usha laughed and gave her a deep, loving kiss. Lilian 
raised an eyebrow as she saw the girl&#39;s hand snake its way towards 
Blake&#39;s rear to give it a little squeeze. She dismissed herself and 
found Gabrielle again, howling at something or other. They kissed and 
fell into the couch, into each other&#39;s arms, and stayed there until 
dinner announcements were made.

.........

Even for the girls that had seen Mr. O&#39;Shannon&#39;s work before, they were 
left in awe at the feast displayed before them. Everything 
imaginable&#151;and some things unusual&#151;had been put before them, each placed 
lovingly and strategically. Gabrielle beamed with pride in spite of 
contributing very little to the meal, and the guests seated themselves 
around the large table.

&quot;Do you girls mind if we pray?&quot; asked Gabrielle&#39;s father to the new 
faces. &quot;It&#39;s sort of a tradition as well.&quot; Mira and Usha didn&#39;t mind, 
and so everyone took the hands of the people sitting next to them as the 
lone male and patriarch of the family spoke: &quot;O blessed Father in 
heaven, we come together as family, friends, and new faces, to give 
thanks on this day and to be with those we love. Give us Your blessings 
for another year, and may we all be healthy and live good lives. Amen.&quot;

&quot;Amen.&quot; The girls dug in and for a few seconds, let the silence dominate 
their meal. Janine was the one who spoke up first: &quot;Oh, by the way, 
happy birthday, Blake.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; A few other girls wished her a happy birthday&#151;she was 
sixteen that year, and could finally drive&#151;and after declining the usual 
song, Blake stood up briefly to give a speech.

&quot;I just wanna say that sophomore year&#39;s been real kind to me. I turned 
from a girl who had never felt love to the pimp you see before you&#151;two 
girlfriends, baby! Seriously, though, it&#39;s been a great year for me. I&#39;d 
like to thanks my friends for just being themselves, being honest, and 
being patient&#151;and I&#39;d also like to thank Mira and Usha for everything 
they&#39;ve done. This has been one of my best birthdays so far. Thank you.&quot; 
The guests smiled and allowed her to eat again. Blake never expected 
presents on her birthday because it fell so close to Thanksgiving&#151;she 
usually got them the Monday after&#151;so she was happy. The others ate and 
ate, speaking only to ask for something to be passed around, or to make 
little comments to each other.

Without a television to entertain them (Gabrielle&#39;s family never put one 
in the kitchen, knowing it would distract them from a meal), 
conversations struck up slowly. The adults complemented Janine and May 
on the success of the musical; Victoria and Blake were applauded for 
their brief appearances in the play. Mira, her English improving 
slightly, tried discussing various forms of entertainment; Usha wanted 
her to exchange new ideas about her political office. Unfortunately, 
Mira was losing interest, and her procrastination was causing her to 
slip behind. Usha was finding herself picking up much of the slack, and 
Blake, of course, could only help so much.

&quot;Why do you always put things off, Mira?&quot; she asked. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you 
rather get them finished first? You only cause yourself more grief if 
you keep ignoring it.&quot;

&quot;I know, I just have too many distractions.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you do. And are you doing anything to fix that?&quot; Mira grumbled.

&quot;No. Could you help me?&quot;

&quot;The only way I could help you is supporting and advising you. You&#39;re 
going to have to at least try before I can really help. I&#39;m not going to 
do your work for you.&quot;

&quot;Hey, none of that at the table,&quot; said Gabrielle. &quot;Here we don&#39;t talk 
about that nonsense. Come on, go easy on the poor girl, it&#39;s 
Thanksgiving.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just saying, I care for her and I want her to be successful. Lately 
she&#39;s just been a little slow, is all. There&#39;s nothing to hold her back 
except those distractions.&quot;

&quot;Well, all work and no play,&quot; said June.

&quot;Yes, but what about all play and no work?&quot;

&quot;But if she&#39;s happy, isn&#39;t that good enough?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not, in this world.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; said Olivia, &quot;don&#39;t you think Mira should have a say in this?&quot; 
Usha looked at her girlfriend as she picked apart turkey and stuffing. 
The younger woman said nothing; she looked like she was in deep thought.

&quot;Mira, anything?&quot;

&quot;...Good food,&quot; she mumbled at last. Blake reached out to caress her 
arm.

&quot;Poor thing... Usha, come on, seriously, stop bugging her. For once, let 
her put things off. I know you mean well, but it&#39;s the holidays. Hey, 
honey, you okay?&quot;

&quot;Meh.&quot; Blake gave Mira a kiss on the cheek.

&quot;It&#39;s not as if she wants to quit being in politics. She&#39;s just a little 
exhausted, is all. She&#39;s not used to it like you are. Give her some 
room.&quot;

&quot;Now that is more like what I needed to hear,&quot; said van Dijk, her smile 
returning. She gave Blake a more intimate kiss and ate with more 
animation. Usha snorted very quietly and resumed as well; the 
conversation went this way and that for the rest of the meal.

Once everyone had their fill, they settled back in the den and turned on 
another football game. Before going into the kitchen to help her parents 
clean up, Gabrielle noticed out of the corner of her eye that Mira and 
Usha had distanced themselves from each other. She knew from experience 
that Blake&#39;s girlfriends often bickered, but knew they&#39;d just be back to 
normal in no time. Lilian offered to help clean up as well, and she even 
donned a cute little white apron so her clothes wouldn&#39;t get wet. 
Needless to say, Gabrielle had a tough time focusing on her job.

&quot;I think you two should seriously talk,&quot; said May during one commercial. 
Mira and Usha regarded her, then each other.

&quot;Hmph. She always expects too much of me. I can only do so much. Blake 
was right; I am not used to this! Usha puts too much pressure on me.&quot;

&quot;But I know that if you put your mind to it, you can be even better than 
I am. You certainly gave me a run for my money during the campaign. 
Whatever happened to that go-getter attitude?&quot;

&quot;Meh. I guess I just wanted to go after it for fun, and I&#39;ve sort of 
lost interest a bit. I don&#39;t have much time for the things I want to do. 
I think I shall quit in the next semester.&quot;

&quot;Mira, you can&#39;t resign.&quot;

&quot;Of course I can. I&#39;m not made for that sort of thing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to sit by and watch the woman I love and respect duck out 
of something simply because it&#39;s too hard for her. Now come on, you&#39;re 
stronger than that.&quot;

&quot;No... I&#39;m really not.&quot;

&quot;Guys, the game.&quot; Blake shushed her girlfriends as the game came back 
on, but they snuck away so they could talk in private. They found one of 
the spare bedrooms and relaxed on the soft mattress. Mira hung her head 
and took Usha&#39;s hands into her own.

&quot;You really will not give up?&quot;

&quot;No. You need this; you said so yourself when you first got into it. &#145;I 
need to do it so I don&#39;t procrastinate&#39;&#151;is that what you said? What 
about your job? Do you get lazy when it gets tough?&quot; Mira glumly shied 
away.

&quot;Some...times.&quot;

&quot;Mira, come on. What&#39;s the matter? You and Blake are sixteen years old 
now; I just had my birthday earlier this month. None of us are kids 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;I know. But sometimes... it&#39;s so hard.&quot; Mira found herself leaning into 
her girlfriend&#39;s embrace, and hugged back with all the love she could. 
Krishnan delicately rubbed her back and kissed her, here and there as 
she whispered.

&quot;But I am here for you. Listen, I&#39;m sorry for nagging&#151;you know I only do 
it because I love you so much, and I know you&#39;ve got what it takes. If 
you seriously feel like you have too much pressure, then fine, you can 
step down. But I want you to at least consider trying again. I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ll make a wonderful vice-president.&quot;

&quot;Hmph, I&#39;m already president, of anime club. And speaking of which, why 
don&#39;t you ever come? Even Blake comes sometimes, and she is not 
interested in anime.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... busy,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Yes, I know, sometimes too busy. Tell you 
what: I&#39;ll come first chance I get on Monday, no conditions. Just please 
try.&quot;

&quot;I... will. But will you still love me if I fail or... mess up? Or 
quit?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I will certainly love you even if you fail or mess up.&quot; She smiled 
and kissed Mira deeply, wanting to prove it to the girl somehow, if only 
by her intimate actions. Mira absorbed Usha&#39;s loving touch and snuggled 
closer to her. Even she began to long for deeper levels of intimacy, as 
Blake had, but didn&#39;t want to scare Usha or do it alone. She was 
beginning to feel sexual, but then and there, it wasn&#39;t right. Perhaps 
later...

&quot;But I certainly may not respect you much if you quit without good 
reason,&quot; she added softly. She could feel Mira nodding, so it seemed 
they came to terms at last.

&quot;I&#39;ll do my best, but I&#39;ll still need your help,&quot; she whispered. Usha 
smiled warmly and held Mira close to her body, silently agreeing to aid 
her beloved however she could. Mira sighed happily, and kissed Usha 
deeply. She let her hands wander underneath the girl&#39;s long-sleeved 
shirt up to her chest, and Usha could feel herself tingling with unusual 
desire. Mira was going to cop a feel, as they said, and she didn&#39;t feel 
like stopping her at all. She winced in pleasure as she felt her 
girlfriend&#39;s palms cover her brassiere, and hissed sharply as they 
squeezed... as they fiddled with the strap... as they tickled, rubbing 
back and forth hungrily...

&quot;Ahem.&quot; The girls froze, and turned a fair red color as they stared at 
the front door. Fortunately, their visitor was Blake, who, from the look 
of her smile, seemed to enjoy the show before her. &quot;As badly as I want 
this to continue, I think you two have had ample time to kiss and make 
up. I think you better join us in the den if you know what&#39;s good for 
you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; said Usha playfully, Mira&#39;s hands still up her shirt. &quot;And what 
would you do to us?&quot;

&quot;Ummmm... I would... pinch you really hard.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t sound so bad,&quot; purred Mira.

&quot;I&#39;d also... bite you.&quot;

&quot;Mm, this gets better.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll go on affection strike!&quot; Mira and Usha gawked in horror and 
composed themselves before Blake could do anything else. Not having 
their third member give them any affection&#151;kisses and hugs and the 
like&#151;was a horrible thing, and even if the threat was empty, there was 
no taking chances. The trio was downstairs again, with their friends, 
before the final tick of the minute.

......

When evening came, the girls decided to sleep over for the evening, as 
they had done in the past. June and Victoria went to their rooms fairly 
early and stayed there, nobody knew why (although a few could certainly 
guess). May simply said that, because the two were now a couple, they 
would want to spend some time in private, but the others knew better.

&quot;Probably they&#39;re humping each other as we speak,&quot; muttered Blake with a 
smile. She and Gabrielle exchanged knowing grins; the others rolled 
their eyes. May almost looked sick.

&quot;If June was having sex, I&#39;d know about it. Anyway, I don&#39;t care which 
room I get, as long as whoever I&#39;m sharing it with doesn&#39;t talk too 
long.&quot; She said goodnight early as well, and went off to a room that she 
would later share with Olivia and Janine. Blake, Mira, and Usha wanted 
to sleep in one bed, but there wasn&#39;t anything big enough, not even the 
master bed. Gabrielle grinned as she teased them.

&quot;Guess you&#39;ll have to pick which honey ya wanna bunk up with.&quot;

&quot;Oh, be quiet, we&#39;ll manage.&quot; Blake stuck her tongue out and disappeared 
into one of the spare bedrooms, leaving Lilian and Gabrielle. They had 
shared a bed before, but it still brought butterflies to their stomachs 
undressing and curling up underneath the sheets with each other. 
O&#39;Shannon couldn&#39;t help but wonder if any of her friends were really 
going to try and have sex in her own home&#151;or even if she was going to 
try it. She knew she wasn&#39;t ready&#151;perhaps sometime in the next 
semester&#151;but it was definitely a thought in her mind. And Lilian felt so 
good, soft and quiet and pretty in the cool darkness.

Meanwhile, Usha and Mira were trying their hardest to resist giving
