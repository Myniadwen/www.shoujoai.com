<a href="../original/allstars-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>Sunday, September 9th, Chairman Fitzgerald&#39;s office

8:00 am

 

Fitzgerald had been awake and active for three hours already: first by 
exercising, showering, and eating, then settling into his routine of 
organizing his affairs for the week. The tournament had went well, 
though not as favorably as he had hoped- his team lost in the 
semifinals- and now it was back to business as usual, overseeing 
academic matters and the school&#39;s general reputation and upkeep. He was 
on his third and final cup of tea when he heard someone knocking at his 
door.

&quot;Come in. Ah, good morning, Miss Howlet.&quot;

&quot;Morning, sir.&quot; She suppressed a yawn and approached his desk with that 
solemnity that is most often found in people during the early hours of 
the day. In her hands was her uniform, neatly cleaned and folded, and 
her sword, polished and sharpened and sheathed. &quot;I, uh, came to return 
these.&quot;

&quot;You may place them on that chair,&quot; he pointed. &quot;I will attend to them 
later.&quot; Rain got the rare opportunity to glance around the Chairman&#39;s 
office as she approached the mahogany chair. It was as opulent and 
austere a place as you could expect: the walls to the left and right of 
her were lined with bookshelves, containing works ranging from 
encyclopedias, biographies, the classics, studied of civilization, 
fencing, music, economics, politics, and sociology. Directly in front of 
her, past the Chairman&#39;s cedar desk, was a fireplace and mantle: a foil 
was placed on it, and above, a painting of a Spanish galleon coming into 
port. There were two portraits flanking the centerpiece, one of a 
beautiful but subdued-looking woman, the other of a school building, 
crowned with ivy.

&quot;My wife and academy,&quot; Fitzgerald stated as he noticed Rain&#39;s stare. 
&quot;Yes, on that chair. Don&#39;t worry about the rest of your effects.&quot; Rain 
put her dreams away for good and turned around, as somber as she had 
arrived. She threw one last glance at her mentor, feeling shamed for 
disappointing him so.

&quot;Sir, I...&quot;

&quot;Have you concluded your business? Then you may leave. All the best to 
your new endeavor.&quot; Rain was smart enough to realize that Fitzgerald, as 
cold as he was, had enough of a heart to let her go without a fight. He 
had spent years honing her into something that could make him proud, a 
living embodiment of his discipline and devotion. In the end, whether 
she chose to be a fencer or a footballer would not make a significant 
difference: she would always carry his training with her.

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; she murmured as she walked out the door.

 

In this wide world

People you&#39;re meant to meet can be seen

Beyond the window, beyond the rainbow

I think you&#39;re aware of them

Take off that restrictive weight

Let your feelings go

Now keep your ears open and wait for that time

Awaken now

Cherish the little dream you&#39;ve drawn in the vast sky

If you do, you can always become happy

It&#39;s certain, whoa whoa!

 

&quot;And on the Seventh Day&quot;

 

Nearly seventeen hours earlier, a group of young women gathered together 
in a certain parking lot, awaiting the arrival of their last companion. 
The mood that Saturday morning was very quiet, somber, and reflective, 
but the sun was bright and the weather was good, the perfect day to 
visit a place like this. Hours earlier, they had been warriors in arms; 
today they were women once more: still weak, still humane, still strong. 
Their favored guest arrived in a taxi, dressed in nice clothes with 
sunglasses, carrying four white flowers.

&quot;Hey, glad you could make it!&quot; Erica Fox waved. These were the women of 
Lovelace&#39;s soccer team, and they had been waiting for their former 
coach. Leena lifted her sunglasses a little and smiled. She looked very 
feminine today, more like a businesswoman than a soccer coach.

&quot;You know I wouldn&#39;t miss out. How are you all doing?&quot;

&quot;Not too bad,&quot; Rochelle Klein answered. She put her hands behind her 
back and hummed very gently as the ladies wound around a path, careful 
not to tread upon the well-manicured lawn, idly making their way to a 
peaceful area, overlooking a small pond where a family of ducks was 
swimming. This is where their friends had been waiting for them: Leena 
saw them first.

She put a flower on each of the graves.

Usha Krishna, Victoria Grissom, Amina Washim, and Olivia Johnson.

May flights of angels send thee to thy rest.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe they&#39;re gone,&quot; Leena sighed, crossing her arms as she 
stared at the tombstones. Little else was carved on their stone faces- 
the year they were born, something about who they were, and the year 
they all died, of which they shared. For many, the memory was still very 
fresh and very painful. Blake Baum and Janine Bautista had lost two dear 
childhood friends- but Blake had also lost a lover, her rock in the 
storm and her voice of reason. Mira van Dijk lost a good friend and 
worthy rival, while Ayanna lost her cousin. The others merely lost 
fellow students, members of the same high school they all attended once 
upon a time, ladies of their own generation.

The future of the world, cold and dead in the ground.

&quot;You know, we dedicated yesterday&#39;s game to them,&quot; Ivory said solemnly. 
&quot;I guess that&#39;s why we played better than we normally did. They were 
watching over us: I could feel it.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so that&#39;s why you all looked so beautiful out there. Are you 
satisfied with the results?&quot;

&quot;Your team got their big break, didn&#39;t they? Our friends would be happy 
for them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not so sure,&quot; Blake sighed, kneeling down to caress three 
headstones. Vicki...Olivia...and Usha... It was more than she could 
bear. &quot;Damn it, I&#39;m gonna take a walk. I can&#39;t stand here like this. I 
gotta get movin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; Janine said as she reached for her. Raisa gently restrained her.

&quot;Let her go. You two may be old friends, but you can&#39;t expect her to 
react the way you are.&quot;

&quot;Hearing about it made us all come to grips with our lives,&quot; Rozalia 
said, squeezing Mira&#39;s hand a little tighter. &quot;It made us think. Made us 
think how time passes us by. How it&#39;s merciful. How we&#39;ve got something 
good here.&quot;

&quot;I know. But strange how things work out. I mean, if that other car had 
been going just a bit slower, and if there had been a little more 
light...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk about it,&quot; Erica said, clasping Janine&#39;s shoulder firmly. 
&quot;That&#39;s not what we came here for. We honored them yesterday. Let&#39;s give 
them our thanks and get on with our lives. They wouldn&#39;t want us crying 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;Tell that to Blake,&quot; Rochelle sighed. She looked to Leena and smiled. 
&quot;I think we&#39;ve been here long enough. We&#39;ll probably go out to eat 
somewhere and celebrate your team&#39;s victory. We sure as hell had a lot 
of fun yesterday.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she said, breaking free of her thoughts. Makes us think 
we&#39;ve got something good...

&quot;So do you need a ride anywhere, Leena?&quot; Kula asked.

&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll be fine. You all go on ahead. It was great seeing you again.&quot;

&quot;You too. Take care- and don&#39;t be a stranger!&quot; Leena waved at them, 
stared at the four tombstones for another moment, bowed, and walked 
away, back to the parking lot, where her taxi was waiting. She asked the 
driver to please take her back to Lovelace Academy. There, her new team 
was patiently waiting for her arrival.

&quot;Are we ready?&quot; Leena looked at them, beaming with victory and hope, and 
smiled warmly. Even after hearing about the tragedy, and being apart 
from her wife for a few days, she was glad they had the chance to come 
here. Overall, it had been a wonderful experience, but now they could 
return home, to rest their wings and prepare for the next challenge.

&quot;Yes, we&#39;re ready,&quot; she announced. Seventeen women boarded the bus; the 
ride back was considerably more festive than the ride there. Rain, 
Jennifer, and Amy were the stars: everyone, even Fleur, heaped them with 
love and praise. But &quot;someone&quot; also made sure that Valencia got plenty 
of credit as well, and boldly kissed her for the first time, right in 
front of everybody.

&quot;Ooooh,&quot; a few purred. &quot;Awww,&quot; sighed the rest. Everyone agreed they 
were a good couple.

&quot;Nadia, honey,&quot; Elisa said as she touched her hand, &quot;we&#39;re not going to 
let them hog all the attention, are we?&quot;

&quot;What iz this with hogz? Why are pigz taking attention?&quot;

&quot;Not that,&quot; she grinned, brazenly touching her face with her other hand: 
&quot;This.&quot; The kiss she had meant to give Nadia in their second game was 
long overdue; Elisa made sure this one was special. So everyone on the 
bus now had two couples to cheer for.

They are pretty cute together, Felicity admitted with a forlorn smile. 
At least Nadia and I can try to be friends. I wonder if Fausta&#39;s still 
willing or not...

&quot;So besides random acts of HLK, how&#39;re we gonna celebrate this awesome 
victory?&quot; Lauren asked as she put her arm around Leena. &quot;We gotta have a 
party. It&#39;s not every day a team like us beats a team like them. We 
worked hard.&quot;

&quot;You did,&quot; she agreed. &quot;You definitely deserve something nice, but I 
don&#39;t want to decide for you. Let&#39;s take suggestions. Hey, how should I 
reward all the hard work you&#39;ve done?&quot; Everyone had her own idea and 
they all started shouting at once. Leena tried writing some of it down 
but couldn&#39;t make sense over the babble. She held her hand up and asked 
for peace. &quot;One at a time. You first, Miss Howlet. It&#39;s safe to say we 
couldn&#39;t have won without you.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, uh, I don&#39;t care. I guess like a restaurant or something.&quot;

&quot;A romantic one with lots of dancing,&quot; Valencia grinned. Jen and Kasumi 
were the only ones that knew what she was referring to.

&quot;That&#39;s dumb,&quot; Lauren grunted. &quot;I say we have a kegger!&quot;

&quot;Not all of us can drink, Lauren,&quot; Terra grunted.

&quot;So? Those of us that can will buy, and you grasshoppers can pay us back 
later.&quot;

&quot;No beer,&quot; Leena smirked. &quot;What else?&quot; Someone suggested miniature golf, 
and another person said they should do karaoke. Amy nudged Freya and 
reminded her about her earlier idea, and she raised her hand.

&quot;Excuse me. It might be too late now, but I was thinking I could invite 
everyone to my estate next weekend. I&#39;ve got horses, a pool, a game 
room, a party room, and with a little time and effort, anything else you 
could conceive. We could even go camping.&quot;


&quot;Awesome!&quot; Nadia exclaimed. &quot;We should be going for that! Tell Frey-Frey 
that all iz in accord!&quot;

&quot;But I wanna have fun now,&quot; Lauren whined. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna wait a whole 
friggin&#39; week! Besides, camping sucks, and pools attract bugs, and I 
burn easily.&quot;

&quot;Oh, quit complaining,&quot; Freya pouted, looking oddly adorable. &quot;It&#39;s an 
indoor pool...and camping is wonderful as long as the weather&#39;s nice.&quot;

&quot;But a whole week! I say we go putt-putt and karaoke tomorrow, first 
chance we get. Everyone takes the day off work and we go have fun as a 
team!&quot;

&quot;Not a bad idea,&quot; Shannon smirked. &quot;But are ya sure ya won&#39;t have a fun 
ovahload?&quot;

&quot;Shame on you,&quot; Nadia said. &quot;Can never have too much fun.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to impose on anybody&#39;s schedules,&quot; Leena said. &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid some of you who have talked to me in private have pushed your 
vacation time to the limit. I wish we could arrange the perfect schedule 
where we could all practice, work, and have time for fun, but that would 
be impossible. Let me just say this: I like Freya&#39;s idea and I think we 
should all try to accommodate it. But since I also understand your need 
for instant gratification, let&#39;s say that whoever wants to can come with 
us. Let&#39;s say...be at Big Tee mini-golf at 10:00 tomorrow morning, and 
karaoke when we finish. Lunch will be provided, of course.&quot; The general 
consensus was positive- everyone clapped and whistled- and a sign-up 
sheet was passed around for both activities so Leena and Freya would 
know just how many would be in attendance. Lauren honestly hoped that 
everyone would be there: she was hedonistic in that she enjoyed seeing 
others have a good time. Yes, everyone: even Fausta and Fleur.

 

- Amy Nguyen, Favorite color: black; right back-

 

A cluster of cars conveyed at Big Tee on Sunday morning, admittedly more 
customers than usual for that time of day. Leena assumed she or Freya 
would be first, but when she arrived, she saw Kasumi standing off to the 
side, chaining her bike and talking to Shannon. They were discussing 
church, and how good it felt to be absent for one day. They laughed and 
joked; it was good to see them both so happy. Lately Leena had feared 
Shannon would be the cause of some friction due to her homophobia, and 
yet here she was, talking to someone who openly outed herself yesterday. 
She also waved to Elisa as she arrived, even smiling. They must be 
exceptional people, Leena thought, for her to act that way.

&quot;Morning, everybody,&quot; she said. Leena had a vest, a sleeveless yellow 
shirt, and shorts that went down to her knees; she looked very tomboyish 
but still pretty. &quot;Glad you could make it. I hope you&#39;re all ready to 
beat me. I stink at golf.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so the mighty Coach Leena does have a weakness!&quot; Kasumi exclaimed. 
Leena grimaced cheerfully and put her sunglasses on; it was bright. 
Lauren rolled in later, clapping and jumping for joy; Terra, Felicity, 
Jen, Valencia, and Nadia trickled in later, followed closely by Rain and 
Alice, and finally Freya, who looked completely exhausted.

&quot;Jeez, you look like you ran here,&quot; Lauren observed. &quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;Just tired. I think I had a little mini-heart attack on the way here. 
No, I&#39;m fine; I&#39;m exaggerating. Shiki and Maria can be a handful.&quot;

&quot;S &amp; M, huh?&quot; Lauren grinned. A few girls laughed at her joke, and Leena 
clapped her hands to get everyone&#39;s attention. Fleur did not sign up for 
this event, stating she&#39;d rather spend time with her &quot;other&quot; group, and 
Arina also declined, stating she &quot;had no place there&quot; since she &quot;didn&#39;t 
contribute anything&quot;. Amy was missing; Rain was worried.

&quot;Can&#39;t start the day without our sexy Vietnamese street fighter. Think 
she got called in to work?&quot;

&quot;At this time of day?&quot;

&quot;Well, the lunch rush does start in an hour, and we&#39;ll be here awhile. 
Damn. I was gonna ask her out on a date! Don&#39;t worry, Al,&quot; she grinned. 
&quot;You can have her next. You&#39;re probably more her type than mine!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to call her. You all go on ahead,&quot; Freya said as she waved 
them through. She sat down on a bench to catch her breath and pulled out 
one of her cell phones. She was glad that her relationship with Amy was 
recovering; she didn&#39;t want to lose the friendship they had before all 
those messes started. When she answered, Amy stated that she would be on 
her way- her bus pass just expired and she had to purchase a new one.

&quot;Don&#39;t have enough for a car,&quot; she explained. Freya noticed she didn&#39;t 
stutter; perhaps it was only when she was around people.

&quot;We&#39;ll be here waiting. I&#39;ll go tell Leena so we can buy you a pass. 
Don&#39;t be late or we&#39;ll start without you. Ladies!&quot; she exclaimed as she 
hung up. &quot;Miss Nguyen will be here shortly. Rain, you behave yourself.&quot;

&quot;Aww, do I have to?&quot; She grinned and perused all the clubs and balls. 
The girls debated whether they should divide into teams or play 
individually- to keep score or not keep score- and if the winners should 
be rewarded with anything.

&quot;Man, I hate it when sports get too competitive,&quot; Lauren grumbled. 
&quot;Can&#39;t we just play for fun?&quot;

&quot;Not all of us are so easygoing,&quot; Elisa replied. She checked her watch 
and muttered, &quot;Darn, where is that Fausta?&quot; Before they could decide on 
the course of their action, a Maserati coupe pulled into the parking 
lot, pouring out a striking Italian with a model&#39;s tall, slim, sculpted 
figure. The darkness of her hair and skin glittered in the sunlight as 
she trotted over the parking lot, radiating sexuality and confidence. 
Following her was a woman who looked like she had just rummaged through 
the bargain bin, a lady in ripped jeans and a baggy tank top with a 
kerchief wrapped around her head and gloves without fingers on. She 
waved meekly and joined them.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; said the fashion diva.

&quot;Fausta,&quot; Leena nodded. Amy sidled up almost unnoticed. Nazario jerked 
her head at her accomplice.

&quot;Look who I picked up at the bus station.&quot;

&quot;We thought you two weren&#39;t going to make it,&quot; Valencia admitted. Fausta 
merely winked at her, setting her heart aflutter.

&quot;Golf&#39;s not my thing- my arm and all- but I could certainly use the 
exercise, and I&#39;d like to be there when you all humiliate yourselves at 
karaoke.&quot;

&quot;Right, and you&#39;re one to talk, Pavarotti?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I could hum a few bars and show you rubes how it&#39;s done. You 
haven&#39;t started yet, have you?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re just picking out clubs,&quot; Alice said. She gave Fausta two choices 
and the lady picked the purple one, stating she liked &quot;those royal 
hues&quot;. Everyone ultimately decided to play individually and keep score 
as she saw fit, then herded out and searched for the first hole. In the 
spirit of fair play, they decided to go alphabetically by last name, 
which meant Jennifer would go first. She set a good precedent by nearly 
sinking it into the hole on her first try.

&quot;Should we play through or wait for everyone to take their turn?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;d be too many balls on the green to keep track of if we all went 
first,&quot; Elisa said.

&quot;That&#39;s what she said,&quot; Rain snickered. Jen finished her shot and stood 
back for Kasumi to take hers. She hit the ball too hard and ended up 
throwing it in the green, cursing.

&quot;Hey Fausta, you got a minute?&quot; Felicity sidled up to the diva and 
cleared her throat; Nazario turned around and raised a dark eyebrow. 
Seeing her approach the group with such magnetism had caused Velur&#39;s 
heart to flutter. Now that she was no longer fearful of her father&#39;s 
scrutiny, she wanted to start acting like her true self: she wanted to 
make up for lost time. She wanted to be proud of herself, for once, and 
of her sexual orientation. Fausta had offered herself once before, and 
hopefully, time would be kind to Felicity.

&quot;By my calculation, I&#39;m going to be in the last half of the lineup, and 
you&#39;re dead last overall. The way Beckett&#39;s swinging, we could be here 
all day. What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Um, about the time you offered to go out with me. I think I finally 
have my answer.&quot;

&quot;Oh? What kept you?&quot; Her voice had a twinge of hostility in it, not that 
Felicity could blame her. She had given her such a feeble response the 
last time. She stood up straight and spoke firmly.

&quot;I was going through some hard times, but I&#39;m a lot better now. I&#39;m 
sorry to keep you waiting.&quot;

&quot;You can stop right there,&quot; she said, focusing completely on the game. 
Kasumi finally got through, her face red and her eyes aflame. Elisa 
fared no better, of course, but she just laughed at herself. Nazario 
continued: &quot;No matter what else you have to say, I have a girlfriend now 
and I can&#39;t be bothered to deal with you. If you were going to say yes, 
you&#39;re just going to have to live with the fact that you had your chance 
and you blew it.&quot;

&quot;Jeez, ghibli, that&#39;s cold,&quot; Shannon muttered. She made a face and said, 
&quot;Yeah, I ovahheard ya, so what? Big whoop, wanna fight about it?&quot;

&quot;Funny you should say that, especially since it&#39;s none of your 
business.&quot;

&quot;Look, I ain&#39;t no friend of yours, but&#39;cha coulda let her off easiah. 
Anyone with half a brain could see that Velur wasn&#39;t all there for 
awhile. She&#39;s improved now, so why not indulge her?&quot;

&quot;Because unlike some people, I actually believe in following my 
commitments.&quot;

&quot;I know that wasn&#39;t meant for me!&quot; Shannon snorted. Fausta ignored her 
and clapped as Alice hit a hole in one.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Felicity sighed. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to ply my love 
elsewhere. I just thought I still had a chance, is all.&quot;

&quot;Nope. What&#39;s that phrase you Americans use? &#39;You snooze, you lose&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Be nice to kittiez,&quot; Nadia said as she stepped up. She failed dismally 
at golf, probably because she used her club like a pool cue. It was also 
fairly obvious she was bending over for Elisa&#39;s benefit, and even 
wiggled her bottom a little.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Nadia,&quot; Felicity said. &quot;I can always ask Amy or Terra. What 
do you say, huh? Either one of you wanna be my girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;This is sudden!&quot; Terra blurted with a jerk. Amy merely blushed and 
smiled. Her and Felicity? But they came from such different worlds...

&quot;Aw, go on and go for it!&quot; Rain smiled as she stepped up to the next 
hole. Years of fencing had given her excellent precision, and she hit a 
hole in one effortlessly. &quot;AHA, YES!! Howlet scores and the crowd goes 
wild! Come on, crowd, go wild!&quot; The ladies clapped for her, and Alice 
even gave her a hug.

&quot;Not so fast, some of us are still stuck at number one.&quot;

&quot;Hurry up, slowpokes! Velur gets to go on a date if you can&#39;t sink it in 
six shots!&quot; Terra and Felicity were the only ones left; they both made 
it well below par. Nadia giggled and said she had a tough break; 
Felicity just smiled.

&quot;Next time.&quot;

&quot;Today&#39;s going to be a busy day,&quot; Jennifer announced as she moved on to 
the fourth hole. Kasumi and Elisa fought to get their ball inside under 
six strokes, but they weren&#39;t doing well. &quot;First golf, then karaoke... I 
also have a hot date later.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Did you find someone nice?&quot;

&quot;You could say that,&quot; she beamed. &quot;Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s someone Elisa 
knows very well.&quot;

&quot;Not Fausta, I hope! Oh, wouldn&#39;t that be a lark if you were her 
girlfriend! Poor Felicity would be so- &quot;

&quot;No, no, no. Me and Fausta? You kidding? No, it&#39;s Robin.&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; she exclaimed, swinging wildly and sending the ball into a nearby 
pond. Lauren volunteered to get it and squealed as she found a frog and 
picked it up. &quot;Well, you couldn&#39;t have found a better person! You two 
will have lots of fun! What do you plan on doing? ...Yes, Lauren, he&#39;s 
very cute. Please put him back.&quot;

&quot;Aw, rats. I was hoping you&#39;d scream. Girls are so cute when they run 
from frogs.&quot;

&quot;I played with frogs all the time back home,&quot; she explained. Alice 
stepped up next and got another hole in one; Rain ran up and slapped her 
rear end.

&quot;Shit, this lady is on FIRE! So what&#39;s this I hear about a hot lesbian 
date?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just an evening out with a friend,&quot; Jen grumbled. &quot;Robin said 
she&#39;d go out with me if we won the game.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sweet. I&#39;d tap that myself if I didn&#39;t have &#39;tall pale and sexy&#39; 
over here. Innit that right?&quot; She smiled mischievously and rubbed 
Alice&#39;s rear end. Kasumi smiled at Jen as they all moved to the next 
hole. She was just starting to get her own feet wet, so to speak, and 
could understand her excitement. She and Valencia were...

&quot;Kasumi!&quot; she called. Valencia looked very beautiful that morning and 
her game was just as good. If they had been keeping score, she would 
certainly be ahead of her (or was it behind?). Kasumi waved at her and 
grinned. It felt so wonderful having such a beautiful, exciting, 
kindhearted woman as her girlfriend.

&quot;Heads up!&quot; A ball came rolling to her feet and she jumped away, nearly 
tripping. Freya grinned sheepishly. &quot;Whew! Better than croquet, huh? I 
can&#39;t remember the last time I went golfing!&quot;

&quot;Can Frey-Frey sing?&quot; Nadia said. The golden-haired woman shrugged. 
&quot;Ach, I am good singer but cannot make Enklish words. Will have to be 
doing it with my own. Too bad only Eleeza understand- well, and 
Frey-Frey too. Ach, oh no! What are handz doing today?&quot;

&quot;Jeez, Khovansky, you really suck at this!&quot; Felicity called out. Nadia 
turned her head and blushed; Felicity had never looked prettier. She was 
smiling and enjoying herself, even though she wasn&#39;t doing much better. 
Would it really be so horrible for Fausta to accept her proposal? It was 
probably for the best, though: she was nowhere near good enough for her. 
Now Amy, on the other hand...

&quot;Shucks,&quot; she whispered as she missed the hole. Amy knocked it in and 
strolled to the next one. She had never played golf in her life and was 
a little slow to get the hang of it. Amy had noticed that she was slowly 
warming up to everyone- first Terra and Freya, then everyone else at 
gradual stages. She still wasn&#39;t comfortable around them, generally 
speaking, but she was definitely recovering. Valencia actually stopped 
to smile at her as she sunk a putt in under par, and Felicity egged her 
about that date. Amy&#39;s stomach spun around as she considered the 
possibilities. Velur had been a reclusive, embittered woman not that 
long ago, just like her, but now she had finally come out of her shell 
and was joining everyone in the fun. She was even flirting a little! In 
Felicity, Amy saw her hope for a full recovery, a parallel life that she 
might one day follow, and wondered if it would be possible if...

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Alice said as her ball went wild. Amy instinctively went for it 
and brought it back.

&quot;There y-ya go.&quot; Alice gave her a shaky smile and continued. Amy wiped 
her face clear of nervous sweat, then grunted as she felt Rain nudge 
her.

&quot;Are you flirting with her, Amy Nguyen? Cuz&#39; if you are, you have to get 
through me first!&quot;

&quot;Uh...s-sorry,&quot; she blurted. Rain smiled and nudged her again.

&quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that! We should have lunch sometime! I mean, 
unless you&#39;re serious about Velur over there. Mmm, doesn&#39;t she have a 
great ass? I mean, besides Terra&#39;s, of course.&quot;

&quot;I heard that!&quot; Terra roared, thrusting her club like a sword. Rain 
scampered away cackling; Amy blushed even deeper. She didn&#39;t want to 
admit it, but she had been noticing Felicity&#39;s curves a lot more...

Darn it, stop that! You&#39;re acting like a horny little schoolgirl! Grow 
up and act your age! If you&#39;re going to be with Felicity, it can&#39;t be 
over something as shallow as her appearance!

&quot;Hey, quit it!&quot; she heard Felicity squealing. Lauren and Valencia were 
splashing her with water, getting her all wet. Amy almost had a nose 
bleed as the soggy material clung to her soft, delicate, clear, sensual, 
silky skin...

Damn it, stop that! Must not let judgment be clouded by impermanence! My 
mind is a clear stream and I will not be swayed by temptations of the 
flesh!

&quot;I didn&#39;t know there was a full moon out tonight!&quot; Freya exclaimed as 
she slapped Fausta&#39;s rear end. She had innocently bent over but now all 
eyes were on her rounded bottom, including Amy&#39;s. She decided to cover 
them and hoped nobody would notice.

Buddha save me, I&#39;m weak. OH, ONE PEEK CAN&#39;T HURT! Yes it can! I have to 
focus on their inner beauty!

&quot;Shit, it&#39;s hot out here,&quot; Lauren said as she removed her outer shirt. 
Now she was only wearing an A-shirt...without a bra. Amy almost fainted.

 

Since it was unilaterally decided that Kasumi had lost the game, she was 
forced to sing first when everyone arrived at their private karaoke 
booth. Dinks and snacks were already provided, and a list of songs was 
programmed in, all designed to embarrass the singers. Kasumi got stuck 
with &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot;, and belted it as quickly and angrily as she 
could- but then she got &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, which she nailed.

&quot;Wow,&quot; said Alice. &quot;That&#39;s a tough act to follow. All right, give me the 
Byrds!&quot;

&quot;Free Bird!&quot; Rain shouted. Alice did a decent job, but she did better 
with her follow-up, &quot;Crazy Train&quot;. Terra&#39;s face practically turned blue 
as she was forced to sing &quot;Let&#39;s Stay Together&quot;, and everyone laughed as 
Nadia did a spot-on impression of Uma Thurman as she sang &quot;Girl, You&#39;ll 
be a Woman Soon&quot; (in Russian, no less). Lauren cheated the system and 
picked out something from Rammstein, but then sang Queen&#39;s &quot;Bohemian 
Rhapsody&quot;. Amy and Fausta refused to go up, of course, but while 
Felicity eventually convinced the former, even saying she&#39;d sing a duet, 
nothing could budge Fausta.

&quot;Not unless you&#39;ve got some real music in there.&quot;

&quot;Party pooper,&quot; Lauren grunted. Felicity smiled at Amy and supported her 
through &quot;What the World Needs Now is Love&quot;; the mood lightened 
considerably when Shannon ran up and, move for move, pantomimed Michael 
J. Fox for &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (even dancing and thrashing around for his 
guitar solo). She stayed up and sang &quot;Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot; as 
Elisa came up and, to everyone&#39;s amazement, played the fiddle note for 
note.

&quot;Shoot, I can&#39;t even get that on Guitar Hero,&quot; Jen grumbled. She didn&#39;t 
know how she&#39;d be able to top that, not even with the Beatles&#39; &quot;Hard 
Day&#39;s Night&quot;. Luckily, Valencia totally bombed her rendition of &quot;Quit 
Playin&#39; Games with My Heart&quot; but made up for it as she sang a Spanish 
aria solely from memory. Kasumi couldn&#39;t help but run up and give her 
another congratulatory kiss.

&quot;Okay, we&#39;re next, Frey-Frey!&quot; Rain shouted as she guided Freya up on 
stage. Everyone whistled as they both sang &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot;- then, 
Freya paralyzed everyone with her rendition of Beethoven&#39;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, 
in German lyrics no less.

&quot;Wow, her version was just as good as Evangelion,&quot; Terra muttered.

&quot;Or Read Or Die,&quot; Jen pointed out. Fausta grumbled.

&quot;What are you geeks talking about now?&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing. Just a culture your sophisticated mind would never 
understand.&quot;

&quot;Bite me,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;And put on some Bob Dylan! Let me show you how 
it&#39;s done!&quot;

 

- Freya von Hohenheim, Favorite color: purple; manager-

 

If Monday was a series of hours stacked atop one another, gradually 
creating a burden of anxiety to be carried around until restless night 
overcame her with short, painful hours, then Tuesday was the result of 
such calamities juxtaposed with an unusual feeling of excitement. 
Certainly Jennifer looked forward to this date- she dreaded it, she 
desired it- the sheer anticipation of it, and what Robin might have in 
store, was pressing down on her, squeezing the juices out until she 
begged for a release. No such pleasure would come until later that day, 
when she had her longtime friend, former roommate, and current object of 
her construed affections all to herself. No Gardenia. No Odessa. No 
Parody. Just pure Robin Granveldt, unveiled before the world.

The thought that she would take Jennifer to Out and About certainly 
crossed her mind a few times. Andre had largely avoided the lesbian 
nightclub, primarily because she had no reason to go there. Oh, she 
might have stepped inside for a minute or two with the others, but she 
had never indulged. She was not a sexual creature even in the loosest 
sense, and did not consider herself part of &quot;that&quot; crowd even after 
recalling her affair with Bertie. That had been different; that had been 
a pure and simple relationship. Not even her attraction to Bertie 
convinced her otherwise; she might just as soon feel this way about a 
guy she knew. But if that&#39;s the way things went, she would not refuse. 
Today, she would make an exception. She might even be inclined to 
disrobe.


&quot;Would I really?&quot; she squealed as she contemplated what to wear. She 
didn&#39;t even know what kind of date this was. No way she could dress 
seductively if this was going to be an innocent affair- but if Robin 
thrust her into that nightclub, how would she explain her dowdy 
appearance? And Robin refused to answer her questions: this was going to 
be a complete surprise. So this date could fall anywhere between a 
simple dinner and movie to outright fornication. She knew Robin well 
enough to know that the other woman wasn&#39;t as shy about her sexuality as 
other people believed: Gardenia wasn&#39;t the only person she had slept 
with. But she also knew about Robin&#39;s prudence and her demanding 
standards. In the end she decided to put on something that could &quot;go 
either way&quot;, and took a moment to brace herself.

Alas, Robin&#39;s choice of outfit did not foreshadow her plans. She, too, 
looked ready to head in either direction: nice enough for friends, but 
sexy enough for intimacy. Jennifer smiled at her and said she looked 
great- &quot;I mean, you look...beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. You certainly look lovely. Well, what would you like to do?&quot;

&quot;What would I like? So it&#39;s my call?&quot;

&quot;I promised I&#39;d do this if you won. The night is yours.&quot; Jen made a 
face.

&quot;I was afraid you&#39;d say that. I thought you would be providing the 
entertainment.&quot;

&quot;I could, if you&#39;d like,&quot; she gestured coolly. &quot;But I&#39;ll just take you 
to dinner and dancing.&quot;

&quot;At that nightclub?&quot; Robin smiled mischievously.

&quot;I&#39;m feeling frisky tonight.&quot; Jennifer blushed. Of course that&#39;s what 
Robin meant by a &quot;surprise&quot;. But she had to remember that her decision 
counted the most. They could completely avoid that place and go 
somewhere else.

&quot;We should have worn older clothes!&quot; she exclaimed with a laugh. &quot;I&#39;d 
actually like to play paintball, if it&#39;s all the same. And there&#39;s also 
this go-kart track I&#39;ve been dying to check out. Um...but just so we 
don&#39;t spoil these ravishing good looks of ours, I&#39;ve heard of this 
really romantic Spanish restaurant where you can go dancing. If that&#39;s, 
um, okay.&quot;

Sorry, Valencia, she winced. But Robin was exuberant; she liked Jen&#39;s 
ideas better.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to credit you for your originality. How about we eat first, 
change clothes, and work off all those calories with some fun?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a great time. Sorry I stole your thunder.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. That just means I don&#39;t get to show you my tatas.&quot;

 

- Alice Hawthorne, Favorite color: tan; right midfielder/reserve-

 

La Pasion, unfortunately, required its diners to reserve tables weeks in 
advance, and it also demanded a certain attire that neither Robin nor 
Jennifer possessed, so they had to forgo their plans in exchange for a 
more pedestrian outing. Luckily, the Olive Garden did not require 
anything as pretentious as reservations or expensive clothes, and it was 
just romantic enough, and atmospheric enough, for their specific tastes. 
Jennifer was more in the mood for Italian anyway, and since this was her 
night...

&quot;Looks like we might visit that nightclub after all,&quot; Robin noted. &quot;I 
mean, since we couldn&#39;t go dancing in that one place...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d actually prefer the paintball and go-karts. That&#39;s the kind of 
person I am.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I understand, but sometimes even a tomboy likes to wear dresses. 
Um...sorry, that came out wrong. It&#39;s something the Flower Child said. I 
don&#39;t want her popping up more than she has to; this night&#39;s about us. 
We really haven&#39;t sat down and spoken in so long.&quot;

&quot;Not without some game between us,&quot; Jen muttered. Her favorite food was 
sushi so she scanned the menu for a seafood item and found a decent 
scampi alfredo pasta (it was difficult to discern with the Italian 
names. Fausta would either feel right at home here or be insulted at 
what Americans thought Italian food meant). &quot;Can I start out asking a 
weird question? Is Granveldt a German name?&quot;

&quot;Dutch,&quot; she corrected. &quot;My family&#39;s Dutch. It means &#39;green field&#39;. 
Gardenia&#39;s the one with the German name. I think it was something like 
Kemperrstadt before they changed it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool. I just have a boring British name. And I&#39;ve always 
thought Jennifer was just the blandest, most tasteless name in the 
world. It&#39;s just like Elizabeth or Mary; it&#39;s almost a clich&eacute;. At least 
your name is pretty- &quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;And Gardenia&#39;s is original. Oh, I&#39;m sorry- I&#39;m just making an 
observation.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your middle name?&quot;

&quot;Harmony. I wouldn&#39;t hate my parents so much if they had used that 
instead. What about you?&quot;

&quot;Marie,&quot; she smirked. Robin ordered a white wine and water, and even 
though Jennifer wouldn&#39;t be legal for eight months, she offered to share 
some. Jen needed it; she felt embarrassed. &quot;Don&#39;t be,&quot; Robin smiled. &quot;I 
usually spell it Mari. I know exactly how you feel. So, did you hear me 
cheering for you at the game?&quot;

&quot;I think everybody heard you,&quot; she muttered playfully. &quot;I honestly don&#39;t 
know what came over me. Maybe I really wanted to go out with you.&quot; 
Blush. Cat out of the bag. Why not just call yourself a lesbian and get 
it over with? &quot;Oh, jeez, did I say that out loud? Um, I didn&#39;t mean...in 
that context...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. We&#39;re here as friends- well, unless you want it to go that 
way.&quot; Jennifer looked into Robin&#39;s enigmatic eyes, wondering whether she 
was being serious or not. Difficult to tell. There was a playful desire 
in there, as playful and seductive as her clothes- a woman who could go 
either way if pushed firmly enough. &quot;You scored a goal, too. I don&#39;t 
remember if you said you ever scored before.&quot;

&quot;Nope, I&#39;m usually kept on defense. I mean, I guess you could call me 
average. I&#39;m certainly not aggressive, but I&#39;m not passive either. 
Robin, you said to me that you&#39;d give Parody to any children you might 
have. Did you mean...with Gardenia, or...&quot;

&quot;I meant it was a very faint possibility,&quot; she replied. The waitress 
finally came around to ask what they wanted: Robin had a hearty bowl of 
soup and a salad complex enough to be a meal. Once she left, she 
continued: &quot;Dee and I are both in our mid-twenties. We&#39;re best friends 
and we love each other very much. We&#39;re committed, but not possessive. 
It&#39;s really not such a strange relationship. If I was going to settle 
down with someone, it&#39;d be her- if either of us ever could settle down. 
Don&#39;t ask me; I really don&#39;t give it much thought. Dang, there we go 
talking about her again. Your turn! Tell me about the first person you 
fell in love with.&quot;

Jennifer had never confided her relationship with Bertie to anybody, not 
even Robin. She had never even mentioned any romantic pursuits, so 
that&#39;s probably why she was asking. She took a breath and tried to 
inform her as discreetly as possible, but in the end, it became 
impossible for Robin to comprehend the full scope of their relationship 
until Jennifer came out with it. Another girl...and they had been madly 
in love with one another.

&quot;Look, don&#39;t read too much into it, all right?&quot; Andre insisted. &quot;Just 
because I had a...a thing with one woman, that doesn&#39;t make me a...a 
lesbian or anything. I just loved her. That&#39;s all there was to it. It 
wasn&#39;t any different to me than...than a boyfriend, or something. It 
just...went past all that.&quot;

&quot;I envy you that experience,&quot; Robin sighed. &quot;Not many people can have a 
relationship like that with someone. It sounds so mature and profound. 
Well- now I have expectations to live up to.&quot;

&quot;No you don&#39;t. That was a long time ago, and it&#39;s over now. But to tell 
you the truth, uh...I have sort of been interested in you for awhile. 
Not like...you know...as a friend. Not just as a friend. I, uh...jeez.&quot; 
She covered her face and was silent as the waitress brought their food. 
They ate in brittle peace for a long time, engaging themselves in their 
meal more than each other. They finally had a distraction and they took 
advantage of it. Eventually, the mood favored her again.

&quot;I just have a crush on you, okay? That&#39;s all there is to it. But it&#39;s 
not because I&#39;m into girls or anything. You&#39;re just...a very magnanimous 
woman.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been called that before,&quot; she chuckled. So, her sweet friend 
and former roommate was carrying a little torch. Remarkable.

&quot;I mean...it&#39;s hard to put into words. You&#39;re pretty and smart, and fun, 
and a little standoffish, and kind of a brat, and...I&#39;m just attracted 
to you. It&#39;s hard to say why. Please don&#39;t think I&#39;m weird or anything 
like that.&quot;

&quot;Jenny,&quot; Robin laughed, &quot;yesterday, I dressed up in a skintight red 
costume and dyed my hair orange so we could promote the Evangelion 
movie. Next week I&#39;ll be in a men&#39;s suit for Pulp Fiction. The week 
after, I&#39;ll be going as Galadriel for our Lord of the Rings marathon. If 
anybody is weird here, then it&#39;s definitely me. Look, what I&#39;m saying is 
that you shouldn&#39;t worry about it. I still like you, okay, and I&#39;ll keep 
on liking you regardless of how strange you get. Dee and Odessa are far 
worse, and I still love them. Oh, I&#39;ll be paying.&quot; She handled the bill 
and took her date back to her car, where they drove to their homes and 
changed clothes before going to Everett Springs Fun n&#39; Games for the 
second half of their date. Along the way, Jennifer posed a difficult 
question.

&quot;Robin, when did you realize you were gay?&quot;

&quot;When I moved out of my parents&#39; house,&quot; she joked. &quot;Uh, but seriously? 
It was probably a little before that. I was never seduced by a camp 
councilor, if that&#39;s what you mean, and I never had any locker room 
fantasies- uh, whoops, too close to home? No? All right. I don&#39;t want to 
step over any lines. I just kept my feelings for my girl friends longer 
than most girls do. I couldn&#39;t really get along with guys: most of em&#39; 
were either cruel, stupid, too obsessed with sports, distant, or just 
boring. I had a few guy friends I liked, but they just felt like friends 
to me. Oh, and I never had any &#39;kissing practice&#39; sessions or &#39;truth or 
dares&#39; that went anywhere. I was invited to the parties but that never 
happened. I just felt myself liking my girl friends more and more until 
I heard what being gay meant.

&quot;But the part about me moving out and living on my own? That&#39;s probably 
what started the whole mess. But I was never forward about it and I 
don&#39;t even think I came out until Dee started coming into my store. I 
was looking into the whole lesbian genre around that time, so maybe I 
was just swayed. I also talked to a few of my friends about it, and 
after what they told me, I decided to just come out. Boy, that really 
isolated me. Out of the fifteen or so I still had hanging around with 
me, I think I kept maybe three or four.&quot;

&quot;I know what that&#39;s like,&quot; Jen muttered, as they drove into the parking 
lot. &quot;So do you think I might be like that?&quot; Robin suddenly leaned over 
and kissed her on the lips, eliciting sparks and fires Jen never thought 
she had. It was like Bertie all over again: clapping, banging, snapping, 
crashing, exploding, immensely wild beauty and excitement. Spontaneity 
was partially to blame. As she drew away, Jen felt disappointed, 
addicted, wanting it to go on and on, and on, even if the world should 
crumble around her.

&quot;You tell me,&quot; Robin smiled. Jennifer was left sitting stunned in the 
car as Robin got out and urged her to follow. She gingerly slipped out, 
as if the slightest brush would bring her crashing back to reality, and 
stumbled to her feet, reeling from the bombarding sensations. It was 
exactly what she believed a drug-induced high felt like.

 

- Shannon Threal, Favorite color: unknown; stopper-

 

&quot;Whew, I&#39;m glad we changed clothes.&quot;

&quot;I know. I think I got some in my hair. You&#39;re pretty good.&quot;

&quot;Hey, all that soccer practice paid off. You should&#39;ve stayed on my 
team.&quot;

&quot;But I was sure you wanted to take a shot at me. For ignoring you all 
this time.&quot;

&quot;Ignoring me? Come on, Rob: I know we don&#39;t talk much, but we do still 
hang out.&quot;

&quot;Well, that- and on this date. I mean, I kept on saying &#39;Gardenia this 
and Gardenia that&#39;, even though I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t. I told you 
this night was about us, and I kept on talking about her.&quot;

&quot;To be fair, Miss Green Field, I mentioned Bertie quite a lot.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s your ex. Exes are supposed to come up like that. Dee and 
I...uh... anyway, I&#39;m sorry. I owe you more than that.&quot;

&quot;Hey, paying for all this was enough for me! I&#39;m just glad we got to 
hang out and be real for awhile. I just didn&#39;t expect you to kiss me, is 
all.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Did you like it?&quot; Robin smiled warmly as she put her hand on the 
car door. Jennifer looked at her numbly, wondering what she would do, 
hoping beyond hope that she would kiss her again, even if only once. She 
wordlessly nodded her head. Robin looked flattered. &quot;Really? I always 
thought I was a lousy kisser. I guess that&#39;s why only people like Dee 
and Odessa like hanging around me. All my other prospects left me cuz&#39; I 
can&#39;t kiss properly.&quot; Jen chuckled.

&quot;You&#39;re joking, right? If you have any defect, little Robin, it&#39;s that 
you&#39;re such a brat. Yeah, you. You act so high and mighty.&quot; She 
approached her date with hips swaying and eyes glowing; Robin smiled 
with excitement. The truth was, she had enjoyed that kiss as well. Very 
much.

&quot;Well then, I&#39;ll try being a little more humble.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; she whispered, now very close to her. Jennifer was 
emboldened by her paintball victory, her go-kart supremacy, and the goal 
that was still fresh in her mind- and, of course, Robin&#39;s soft flowery 
lips upon hers. She kissed her again and put firm arms around her 
delicate womanly body, enraptured into higher planes of pleasure that 
most mortals can only fantasize about. She felt thrills anew as Robin 
penetrated their fleshy barrier, and made love to Jennifer&#39;s slick pink 
tongue. As she drew back, a strand of saliva hung in the air before 
snapping and flinging onto Jennifer&#39;s chin.

&quot;I told you I had a surprise in store,&quot; Robin whispered. Jennifer was 
like a beast stricken dead.

&quot;Hey Robin?&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;...I think I&#39;d like to go to that nightclub now.&quot;
