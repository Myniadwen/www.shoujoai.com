<a href="../original/journend-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        Rachel cursed softly as her sports car violently bounced on 
another potthole then the black haired woman peered through the trees 
ahead dubiously. &quot;Hope this place is close by,&quot; she muttered. She came 
around a corner and felt a surge of relief seeing the old mansion, 
sounding the horn loudly to announce her arrival.

        Getting out of her car Rachel saw two women sitting on a small 
hill, both looking at her in surprise. Thumping the door shut she looked 
around the place with a wry smile and said, &quot;I got lost twice trying to 
find this place.&quot;

        &quot;Rachel?&quot; Nicole blurted out as she scrambled to her feet, the 
redheaded woman gazing at her old friend in shock. She dusted her blue 
jeans off quickly, straightening out her shirt.

        &quot;Hey,&quot; Rachel&#39;s normally serious face lit up with a smile as she 
walked over. The woman beside Nicole seemed to fade a moment, almost 
like she was disappearing, then she firmed up slightly. &#39;Is that a....&#39; 
Rachel thought in surprise.

        &quot;Rach you rat,&quot; Nicole laughed as she hugged her friend close 
then scolded, &quot;you should have called ahead!&quot;

        &quot;You weren&#39;t answering your phone again,&quot; Rachel laughed softly, 
returning the hug, &quot;on another writing binge?&quot; She looked up and saw a 
glare on the other woman&#39;s face, clearly pissed at seeing her. &quot;So who&#39;s 
your friend?&quot; Rachel asked gently.

        &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m writing again,&quot; Nicole blushed before gesturing to 
Laura, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Laura.&quot; She waved towards Rachel as she 
told Laura, &quot;She&#39;s my best friend from Vancouver.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, hello,&quot; Laura smiled at Rachel reluctantly, her pale blonde 
hair blowing around her pale face then straightening out as she 
concentrated.

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure how to ask this,&quot; Rachel said as she looked at 
Nicole then gestured to the nearly transparent woman, &quot;but she&#39;s a 
ghost, right?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Nicole looked mildly stunned as she continued, &quot;you&#39;re 
taking this well.&quot;

        Rachel flashed them a smile, &quot;Yes and no. I called up a Realtor 
in town to check up on you and he mentioned you had a ghostly landlord, 
sorta.&quot;

        &quot;Landlord?&quot; Laura raised an eyebrow, her long dress flowing 
around her legs.

        &quot;Remind me to have a little talk with Simon,&quot; Nicole frowned.

        &quot;Now, now, he&#39;s just worried about you.&quot; Rachel undid her 
leather jacket, her tight black pants hugging those long legs as she 
added, &quot;And I think he&#39;s got a bit of a crush on you, the poor boy. You 
haven&#39;t told him?&quot;

        &quot;This is a small town,&quot; Nicole reminded her with a sigh.

        Laura was looking at some of the button&#39;s on Rachel&#39;s jacket 
with fascination. &quot;Nobody knows I&#39;m a lesbian,&quot; &quot;Too Queer,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m the 
girl that your mother warned you about,&quot; and many others decorated the 
front along with rainbow and pink triangle pins.

        &quot;Well it&#39;s about to get smaller,&quot; Rachel puffed out a sigh as 
she continued, &quot;you see, I came out here to warn you.&quot;

        &quot;Warn?&quot; Laura frowned.

        Rachel looked over at Nicole, &quot;Your ex-girlfriend, also known as 
the wicked bitch of the west, is coming out here to see you, too.&quot;

        &quot;Well shit,&quot; Nicole groaned, &quot;when?&quot;

        &quot;Not sure,&quot; Rachel sighed.

        Laura&#39;s eyes widened slightly in relief as she followed the 
conversation. &quot;Then you two, you weren&#39;t...?&quot; she asked.

        Rachel laughed, &quot;Once, a very long time ago. We quickly 
discovered we made better friends than lovers.&quot; She saw the emotions on 
Laura&#39;s face, the pure relief there then warm caring as she gazed at 
Nicole and had to smile.

        Nicole blinked as she watched her friend and Laura, then she 
shook her head. &quot;Come on,&quot; she bent over to pick up the last of the 
lunch then said, &quot;let me show you around.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry for interrupting,&quot; Rachel dropped her voice to say to 
Laura.

        Laura looked away, her long hair flowing around her face as if 
stirred by a breeze felt by her alone. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to interrupt,&quot; 
she said softly in reply.

        &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rachel chuckled before she sped up to catch 
Nicole. &quot;It&#39;s been weeks,&quot; she said to Nicole, &quot;have you found a 
girlfriend yet?&quot;

        &quot;Rach!&quot; Nicole protested as they went into the front hall.

        Rachel laughed wickedly, looking into the living room on 
Nicole&#39;s direction. &quot;If I moved I&#39;d have a girlfriend that fast,&quot; she 
remarked.

        &quot;I&#39;m not you,&quot; Nicole shook her head.

        Laura seemed to materialize in the hallway nearby, floating 
slightly as she kept pace with them. The three ascended the stairs 
together, Nicole pointing out the highpoints of the stately old house as 
they walked on.

        &quot;You have not known true love, then?&quot; Laura asked Rachel 
curiously.

        Rachel gave her a curious look and wryly asked, &quot;You mean the &#39;I 
love you forever, we&#39;ll never be parted again,&#39; kind of love?&quot;

        Laura frowned, clearly she didn&#39;t much like the tone of Rachel&#39;s 
voice. Oddly the temperature in the hall began to dip steadily, a chill 
settling in their bones even as the light faded away while the spirit 
glowered at the young woman.

        &quot;What...?&quot; Nicole blinked.

        &quot;I haven&#39;t been that lucky,&quot; Rachel said to Laura with a sad 
little smile, pushing her long black hair back from her face 
uncomfortably.

        The light and cold were gone as quickly as they came, Laura 
looking oddly embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; and with that she faded away 
completely.

        &quot;Laura!&quot; Nicole called but silence was her only answer

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Rachel cursed softly. She looked over at Nicole and 
sighed, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

        &quot;She does that,&quot; Nicole reassured her, &quot;sometimes I&#39;m not even 
sure why, too.&quot; Of course, her voice made it pretty clear she knew why 
this time.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to hurt her feelings,&quot; Rachel shook her head. She 
puffed out a breath, &quot;Even knowing she was here Nicole is unnerving.&quot;

        Nicole made a face, &quot;There goes my theory that lesbians aren&#39;t 
afraid of her.&quot;

        Rachel looked over at her with a weak smile, &quot;Simon mentioned 
you weren&#39;t scared of the ghost but I didn&#39;t quite believe it.&quot;

        Nicole smiled at her friend, &quot;She doesn&#39;t scare me, not even 
from the start.&quot; She ran a hand through her hair, &quot;Though that little 
show in the hallway is a new development.&quot;

        &quot;I need a drink,&quot; Rachel sighed.

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Nicole agreed as they walked back to the kitchen. 
Nicole sat the picnic basket on a counter then opened up the upper 
shelf, bringing down a bottle of amber fluid. &quot;Ice?&quot; she asked as she 
hefted the bottle of bourbon.

        &quot;Please,&quot; Rachel said as Nicole got two small glasses down. Ice 
cubes from the freezer clinked into each then she poured the bourbon 
over them. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rachel took a glass, hefting the weight.

        &quot;Cheers,&quot; Nicole tinked the glasses together.

        &quot;To old friends,&quot; Rachel said then took a drink. &quot;Sorry for 
offending your... friend,&quot; she said, deliberately pausing before saying 
the final word.

        Nicole narrowed her eyes as she looked at Rachel, &quot;What are you 
implying?&quot;

        &quot;She certainly wasn&#39;t happy having someone else here,&quot; Rachel 
pointed out. She laughed suddenly, &quot;I wonder what&#39;ll happen when your ex 
arrives?&quot;

        Nicole wasn&#39;t that easily diverted, &quot;You think Laura was 
jealous?&quot;

        Rachel smiled, the ice clinking slightly in the glass as she 
looked through the amber fluid. &quot;I don&#39;t know, what do you think?&quot; she 
purred.

        &quot;You&#39;ve been hanging out with your therapist too long,&quot; Nicole 
muttered.</pre>
