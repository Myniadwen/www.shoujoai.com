Sorrows (coming soon) It is a side tale that does not really effect the 
enjoyment of either tale however some may want to read the first 4 
chapters of this tale before reading Book Two of ASD. Enjoy! 

Chapter One

The sun had descended to its place of slumber leaving trails for purple 
and golds on the clouds that drifted like balls of cotton candy in the 
sky. A wind rustled through a field of tall grass causing it to look 
like a sea of green against the prismatic sunset. For the most part it 
was a beautiful end to a nice spring day. However, for one young girl it 
was just the sign of the beginning of another bleak cold night. As the 
last remnants of light began to fade away the child crept out from the 
small set of bushes in which she had been hiding. The girl looked about 
in search of something. Almost afraid to move from her hiding place. 
Then the sound of footsteps could be heard. She was prepared for this. 
Staying low, awaiting with eyes prepared for any sign of movement. She 
peered out across the field in search of anything that would betray it 
to the thing the child feared. Off to the right the grass parted for a 
moment. The child watched carefully, there had to be no mistake that the 
movement was not caused by the wind. Eyesight strained in the moonlight 
she watched the grass ever so carefully. A shadowy form slid through the 
grass causing it to part on occasion. Fear filled the girl&#39;s eyes. 
Although she had been prepared for this, it didn&#39;t remove the fear that 
seeing such a creature caused on her heart. She burst into a run through 
the field, not wanting the creature to come into full sight, away from 
the shadow that slithered towards the sound of movement. The girl was 
not sure that she would be able to escape this time, however she would 
not stop to see how close the shadow was. All that mattered was getting 
out of the field and finding a new place to hide before she was caught. 

She zigzagged through the grass in search of some means of escape when 
she suddenly burst out of the field to find herself standing on a broad 
flat surface. The child stopped for a moment baffled by the sudden 
change in her surroundings when she was flooded by white light. 
Something hit the girl with such force that she was were tossed off of 
her feet and she tumbled across hard pavement. The girl lay still on the 
road staring up at the sky. She tried to move only to feel pain shoot 
through her entire body. As the child drifted off, she heard the sound 
of voices calling out for help and a door of some kind opening. The cold 
touch of death brushed against the child&#39;s cheeks and she drifted into 
an endless slumber. 

*****

Kai awoke with a start. The nightmare of that night still hung heavy in 
her head. She rubbed her head as she tried to shake the feelings out of 
her mind. It has been over a year since she had awoken to find herself 
resting in a hospital, bandages covering one of her arms and her head. 
She could barely remember her own name, never mind how she got there. 
The doctors were baffled as to how she lived after being hit so hard by 
a speeding car. All she wanted to know was who she was. When no one came 
to claim her as their own she was sent to a foster home where she now 
stayed. 

Slowly, Kai looked around her tiny room. The walls of the room were all 
made of a reddish brick and cement was squeezed out between them as if 
the building was made in haste. A small dresser and tiny bunk bed were 
the only things provided for her. The few clothes she gained where 
hand-me-downs from former residents of the small room she now called 
home. She used to share her room with another lonely girl, however that 
child was luckier then she for they found a loving home rather quickly. 
Kai wasn&#39;t sure if it was her looks, which were shabby at best, or her 
general personality that made her unwanted, but she really didn&#39;t care. 

Carefully Kai pulled back the thin blankets and stepped out onto the 
cold wooden floors. She crossed the room to see herself for a brief 
moment in a small cracked mirror that sat upon the dresser. She was pale 
and had a rather petite figure. She stood not quite five feet tall and 
if it wasn&#39;t hard enough being an orphan child, being so tiny just added 
to the things kids at school could tease her about. She guessed her age 
to be about fifteen or sixteen, she was not positive for her memories 
were still on the hazy side. Her face was round and had a boyish quality 
to it. If she didn&#39;t know better she would have thought she was a boy. 
Her hair was a mass of short dark scruffiness that looked like a lion&#39;s 
mane. She fought with her bangs for a moment to find they were a pain as 
ever to manage. With a depressed sigh she gave up on her hair and 
continued across the room to a little window in a slanted wall, that 
only made the room seem all the more cramped. She pulled the window open 
and flung out the shutters, then stuck her head out to get a breath of 
fresh air.  

Kai looked up at the summer sun happily dancing between clouds over the 
small town causing light to twinkle. Summer was almost over, however 
there was little sign of it leaving in place of autumn anytime soon. The 
air was filled with the smell of leaves and the sound of the many 
chirping birds of the morning hour. Kai curled up her arms on the 
windowsill and scanned the many houses that formed the town of Darken. 
For the most part the town looked like any other. Small wooden houses 
scattered here and there with a few stone buildings added into the mix. 
A corner bakery down the road. The steeple of a church in the distance, 
where Kai bet that families would gather on Sundays. She wondered which 
one could possibly be the home she was born in. Were her parents still 
waiting for her to come home? Or were they even alive anymore? Kai 
pondered this almost every morning as she gazed across the sleepy town. 
The unusual thing about the town was the large school atop a hill that 
the town was centred around. It stood taller then any other building and 
to Kai looked as if it was watching over the people. Almost making sure 
that no one was out of line. The idea sent a shudder through her spine 
and she wrapped her arms around herself. 

&quot;Kai, you awake?&quot; A soft quiet voice mumbled through the door to her 
room.

Kai quickly pulled her head out of the window, &quot;Yes.&quot; She answered 
looking over at the door, &quot;You can come in Cindy.&quot; She beaconed the girl 
to enter.

The door opened and an even younger girl of about eleven-years-old 
entered the room part way.  The girl had straight brown hair cut cleanly 
at the shoulders and was dressed in a grey T-shirt and blue jeans that 
were a tad too big. Her large dark eyes, which had no whites, held an 
almost dead expression to them. Also, there was a pair of unusual black 
curved markings above her right eyebrow, &quot;Mrs. Mathews said to come down 
for breakfast.&quot; She mentioned in a hushed voice, when she spoke she 
sounded as dead as her eyes seemed. Cindy had been with the Mathews only 
a few weeks before Kai came to live there. The moment Kai set eyes on 
the girl she knew that this child had a rough past. More then once did 
Kai try to make friends with the girl, however each time Mrs. Mathews 
would enter the room the girl would close up or simply  disappear 
entirely. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be down in a moment.&quot; Kai said with a stretch, &quot;I need to get 
dressed first.&quot; Cindy hesitated at the door for a moment. Kai looked at 
Cindy curiously. Unsure if the girl was going to say something more or 
not. Cindy let out a tired breath and closed the door. Kai waited for a 
moment to see if the child would return and only when she was certain 
that she would not be disturbed did she open the old wooden dresser and 
pulled out a pair of worn black jeans that were too long and an 
oversized black T-shirt. Gloomily she stripped off her nightgown and 
began to dress. She first pulled on the jeans and rolled up the bottom 
of the pants up so they didn&#39;t drag upon the floor, then stood and 
played with the waist. They were a smidgen too large in the waist and 
merely sat upon Kai&#39;s nearly non-existing hips, showing off the top band 
of her white panties. She grabbed a thin brown belt from atop the 
dresser and buckled it tight around her waist. Satisfied her pants would 
not wander down to her ankles she pulled on the shirt and exited her 
room. 

She ventured down a flight of rickety stairs to the livingroom. There 
was a stone fireplace along the wall closest to the stairs. Opposite 
that stood a sofa which had been pushed up against a large paned window. 
Thin white curtains only failed to block out the suns strong mornings 
rays. A large oval rugged carpet lay in the middle of the room with a  
wooden coffee table, that seemed to be hand carved, centred squarely. An 
old wooden chair was placed off to her right and a large rocking chair 
to her left. Here and there were several black and white photos of 
people that Kai assumed were family and other orphans that had lived 
here from time to time. The room held a warming, yet antique, quality to 
it.

&quot;Where is that girl?&quot; Mrs. Mathews grumbled as she removed a hot pot of 
oatmeal from the large cast iron stove. Mrs. Mathews was a rather large 
woman who liked to dress in old fashioned attire, which at that moment 
consisted of a long brown dress, that one was more likely to have seen 
in a pioneer village, and a white apron. She turned to look upon Cindy, 
whom had seated herself at the table in front of a small bowl of 
steaming oats, &quot;Cindy, you did tell her to come down, didn&#39;t you?&quot; She 
irately interrogated the girl. 

Cindy nodded not letting her eyes leave her bowl. A teenaged girl with 
long golden hair stared at Cindy from across the table, &quot;She&#39;s probably 
lying. She was probably to scared to talk to that girl and I don&#39;t blame 
her.&quot; The teen dipped a piece of toast in to the yolk of her eggs, &quot;She 
is creepy. I wish she would go away.&quot;

&quot;I wish you would shut up, Emily.&quot; Kai snarled from the kitchen&#39;s 
swinging doorway.

&quot;Don&#39;t talk to my daughter like that.&quot; Mrs. Mathews snapped, &quot;Sit down 
and eat or you&#39;ll be late for school. 
  
&quot;Why do I have to go to that stupid school anyway?&quot; Kai demanded angrily 
as she sat in the chair beside Cindy. 

&quot;Cresthill is not a &#145;stupid&#39; school and I don&#39;t want to hear that you 
have been skipping again is that clear, Kai!&quot; Mrs. Mathews ordered, 
slamming a bowl of oatmeal onto the table in front of Kai.

&quot;I don&#39;t want any of that slop.&quot; Kai pushed the bowl away in disgust and 
got up from her chair.

&quot;Where do you think you are going?&quot; Mrs. Mathews prayed, as Kai pushed 
through the kitchen door, &quot;You get back here and eat like you are told.&quot; 
She commanded.

&quot;You aren&#39;t my Mother so stop acting like it.&quot; Kai snarled furiously, 
she put her shoes on, grabbed her backpack and opened the front door.

&quot;Listen to me when I&#39;m talking to you.&quot; Mrs. Mathews stormed out of the 
kitchen after Kai, &quot;Don&#39;t you give me that lip.&quot;

Kai quickly slammed the door behind her with enough force to scare off a 
group of sparrows, &quot;Will you just shut up for once?&quot; She muttered as she 
crossed the lawn. Kai ran across the road and didn&#39;t stop until she was 
a good distance away. When she was sure that Mrs. Mathews did not 
follow, she slowed her pace and stuffed her hands in her pockets. She 
walked down the street in a huff,  kicked at a small stone and watched 
it tumble down the road, &#145;The nerve of that woman.&#39; She reflected to 
herself, &#145;Why can&#39;t she understand that I just want to be left alone. I 
don&#39;t belong here.&#39; She ruffled her hair in frustration. 

&quot;She&#39;s just trying to help.&quot; A voice called out from somewhere above 
Kai. 

Kai looked up to see there was a girl perched high in a tree. She had 
short light brown hair that curled upwards at the back and wore a blue 
skirt and white short sleeved dress shirt. A pair of large glasses were 
poised upon her tiny nose, &quot;Oh, it is just you Anita.&quot; Kai let out a 
sigh of relief, &quot;How many times have I told you not to look into my 
mind?&quot; She half snarled at the girl. 

Anita jumped out of the tree and softly drifted down, her feet not quite 
touching the ground as she floated along beside the girl, &quot;I couldn&#39;t 
help it.&quot; She protested while fixing her glasses, &quot;Your inner voice was 
so loud that I think that I could have heard it on the other side of 
town.&quot; She explained.

Kai continued to walk with her head down, &quot;and stop showing off in front 
of me while you are at it.&quot; She said coldly.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Anita blinked and looked down to see she was still drifting 
inches above the road, her legs partially transparent to the rest of her 
body, &quot;Oh, Sorry, it is second nature to me. I keep forgetting that you 
are a &#145;Normal&#39;&quot; Anita&#39;s hand cover her mouth to cut off her own words, 
but it is already to late.

Kai stops in her tracks and clenched her fists at her side. As if being 
short and having no family wasn&#39;t enough she had to find herself going 
to a school filled with strange people. Kai didn&#39;t find the strangeness 
as unnatural. She didn&#39;t even seem to be phased when she first learned 
that her friend was &#145;half dead&#39; as Anita liked to call it. Even the fact 
that Anita drifted above the ground didn&#39;t bother Kai in the slightest. 
What did was the way everyone treated her for not being like the rest of 
them. She let out a deep sigh as she trudged along the sidewalk towards 
school.  

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kai.&quot; Anita apologised profusely, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I 
didn&#39;t mean it that way. I just...&quot; She stumbled over her words trying 
to figure out how to right the wrong she just caused on her friend. 

&quot;I know...&quot; Kai shoved her hands deeper in her pockets, &quot;Just forget it 
and let&#39;s go to school.&quot;

&quot;Kai...&quot; Anita could not think of what to say. She let herself drift to 
the ground, her legs solidified as they touched the sidewalk and ran 
after her friend. 

Cresthill High school looked just like any other school. It was a large 
building several floors high surrounded by lush green grass and trees. A 
stark contrast to the schools grey brick and steel framed windows that 
gave the building a bleak feel to it. The school might have looked 
normal, but the students were far from it. They ranged from ghosts who 
have lost their way to strange children with a darker purpose. Kai was 
still unsure why she was sent to such a school. It was not like she was 
unique in anyways. So she survived a head on collision with a car and 
left a dint in the hood with her head. That doesn&#39;t make her worth of 
Cresthill&#39;s unusualness now did it?

Kai stood at the school gates staring up at the building pondering these 
things and more when someone pushed her causing her to stumble into the 
stone walls that surrounded the school grounds. Laughter filled the air, 
however when Kai turned around her assault was nowhere in sight. 

&quot;Kai, are you alright?&quot; Anita asked concerned for her friend. 

Kai leaned against the wall and looked up at the blue sky, &quot;What am I 
doing here?&quot; She pondered aloud.

Anita frowned and looked at the other students as they stared at the two 
of them. She turned back to Kai and shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know but I 
know one thing.&quot; She commented softly. 

&quot;And what would that be?&quot; Kai asked grumpily, closing her eyes and 
crossing her arms. 

&quot;That I&#39;m glad you are here.&quot; Arai stated with a small smile.

Kai opened her eyes to look upon the face of her only friend, &quot;Thanks.&quot; 
She said with a half smile. 

The two girls passed through the school gates and Kai suddenly stopped 
cold in her tracks. Anita looked at her friend stunned by her abruptly 
action, &quot;Kai, is something wrong?&quot; She inquired concerned about the way 
her friend&#39;s eyes kept darting around the schoolyard, &quot;You are acting 
kind of strangely and for you that is odd.&quot;

Kai looked around, hastily in search of something. Finally she stopped 
when her eyes came across a small pale child, maybe a year or so younger 
then them. The girl&#39;s skin was as white as the purest of ivory along 
with her long flowing hair that was tucked around a pair of small 
pointed ears. She wore a long powder blue dress that gave the girl even 
more of a spectral quality then Kai&#39;s half-dead friend. Kai pointed the 
girl out to her friend, &quot;Anita, who is that?&quot; She asked inquisitively 
watching the girl drift across the school lawn.

Anita looks over to where Kai was pointing and adjusted her glasses, 
&quot;Hmm? Oh her... I think her name was Ash... Ashley... Something.&quot; She 
thought to herself before continuing to speak, &quot;She just arrived here 
yesterday, but of course you would know that if you hadn&#39;t skipped class 
again. The word is she came from the Western Wood just like yourself.&quot; 
She stated with a grin that disappeared the moment she received a 
warning glare from her friend, &quot;Anyway, don&#39;t bother trying to talk to 
her. From what I&#39;ve heard you should stay far away from that one. 
Something about her eyes...&quot;

&quot;Why is that?&quot; Kai couldn&#39;t keep her own eyes off the pale girl, &quot;She 
looks like a cute little girl. What about her eyes?&quot; She probed even 
more curious. She could not understand it but something about the child 
struck her funny. Where usually the oddness of the students didn&#39;t make 
a difference to Kai, something about this girl peeked her interests. 

&quot;She doesn&#39;t have any.&quot; Anita declared in an eerie voice. Kai turned to 
see if Anita was pulling her leg. Anita ignored her friend&#39;s stares as 
she continued, &quot;I mean everyone here is strange in some way or another, 
but she is plain creepy if you ask me. Supposably if you look into her 
eyes it is like looking through a window to hell... or something much 
worse.&quot; Anita finished with a creepy laugh.

Kai began to turn back and look at the child. &quot;no eyes... That is a new 
one, isn&#39;t it.&quot; She mused more to herself, &quot;Hard to believe any of that 
is true. I mean they are just rumours right?&quot; She queried.

&quot;Hard to say.&quot; Anita shrugged, &quot;And I&#39;m not the curious type to find out 
if it is true or not.&quot; She gazed at her friend who was still mesmerized 
by Ashley, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Anita inquired even more concerned, 
&quot;You have not been acting like yourself today.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Kai stated in a bit of a daze. There was something 
about the new girl that she needed to know more about. She was about to 
approach the girl when one of the senior students stepped up to the 
child.

&quot;Say isn&#39;t that, that rich brat Marie talking with the new kid?&quot; Kai 
asked inquisitively. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Anita stepped back at the sight of the Amazon girl. To say that 
Marie was tall would be an understatement. To both Anita and Kai she was 
a monster and known to be quite the bully too. Not what you would expect 
from girl who was brought up around the finer things in life and was 
known to show up in school dressed in frilly pink dresses and showing 
off her newest earrings, &quot;What could she want with such an odd girl. It 
is not like Ashley has any friends or is popular or anything.&quot; Anita 
stated aloud what Kai was feeling deep inside. Marie suddenly grabbed 
the little girl by the front of her dress, picks her up off the ground 
with one arm and stared at the girl maliciously. 

&quot;Why that self righteous little...&quot; Kai hissed under her breath, &quot;Who 
the hell does she think she is?&quot; Kai ran towards the fray with her 
friend close on her heels, &quot;Let her go Marie!&quot; Kai demanded.

Marie looked up to see Kai running in her direction, &quot;Hmmm...&quot; Marie 
turned her attention to her new adversary while still holding the little 
girl in one hand, &quot;Oh, The normal. Is there something I can do for you?&quot; 
She asked casually, as if holding a little girl by the neck was an 
everyday event.

&quot;Stop playing games!&quot; Kai balled her hand into a fist at her side, &quot;You 
heard me. Let her go... NOW!&quot; She commanded this time.

Marie looked between Kai and Anita, Then back at Ashley, &quot;Have it your 
way.&quot; She remarked with a shrug, &quot;If you want her you can have her.&quot; She 
dropped Ashley to the ground causing the girl to land in a heap then 
turned on her heels and walked away. 

&quot;WOW!&quot; Anita glomped Kai, &quot;Kai, you are so cool!!! My heart was pounding 
so hard. I can&#39;t believe you stood up to Marie like that, I mean she 
could have killed you and still!! WOW!!&quot; She rattled in a excited blur 
that Kai almost didn&#39;t catch all of. 

&quot;It was nothing.&quot; Kai crossed her arms behind her head and lightly 
blushed in embarrassment of the fuss her friend was making, &quot;Marie is 
just a big bully. She never really scared me.&quot; The truth of the matter, 
Kai was terrified and her heart was still pounding to that very moment.

Anita glanced over to where Marie disappeared behind the school, &quot;She is 
still scary if you ask me.&quot; She admitted with a shudder. 

Kai kneeled down to Ashley&#39;s side, &quot;Hey, You don&#39;t have to worry 
anymore. Marie won&#39;t be hurting you anymor-&quot; At that moment the little 
girl opened her eyes. She did have eyes, contrary to what Anita 
believed, however they too were as white as her skin. The iris were even 
white and there was no sign of pupils, like some kind of strange ivory 
marbles. Kai found it hard not to stare into those eyes. Then her head 
suddenly filled with images of fire and darkness. The flames began to 
spiral and an image formed. A black silhouette of a strange bird created 
out of curved triangle markings. She could hear her name being called 
out over and over again.

&quot;KAI!!!&quot; Anita screamed into Kai&#39;s ear startling her out of her 
thoughts.

&quot;Huh?!? Wha???&quot; Kai looked around alarmed to find herself standing at 
the school again. The image still fresh in her mind.

Anita watched her friend carefully, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She asked more 
worried then ever about Kai&#39;s behaviour, &quot;Should I get the nurse?&quot; She 
started to move towards the school.

Kai grabs Anita&#39;s hand, &quot;No.. No nurse...&quot; She rubbed her head, &quot;I just 
saw something in her eyes is all.&quot; She explained.

Anita leaned close to Kai, &quot;See I told you so...&quot; She whispered into the 
girl&#39;s ear.

Kai looked at Ashley who is now curiously staring at her with those 
blank eyes. Her mouth slowly opens and closes, however no sound emitted 
from her lips. 

&quot;What is she trying to say?&quot; Anita asked curiously watching the girl.

&quot;Th.. Thank you...&quot; Kai repeated the girls mouth movements, &quot;I think...&quot; 
She puzzled.

Ashley got to her feet and ran towards the school leaving the two girls 
alone. They simply stared at the girl as she disappeared into the 
school, suddenly the air filled with the sound of the school&#39;s bells 
ringing.

&quot;Ahhhh!!!&quot; Anita jumped in place, alarmed by the sound, &quot;We are going to 
be late! Come on Kai.&quot; She started to run across the lawn and turned 
back to see Kai still standing in a daze, &quot;Are you coming?&quot; She asked 
more urgently this time.

&quot;No, you go ahead.&quot; Kai waved her hand for the girl to continue on her 
way.

&quot;You are not planning on skipping again are you?&quot; Anita said placing a 
hand on her hip. 

Kai rubbed her temple, &quot;I... I just need some time to myself.&quot; She 
stated grimly. 

&quot;Oh...&quot; Anita stepped towards the school and stopped again. She was torn 
between her duty to be a good student and her need to help her friend, 
&quot;If you need me I&#39;ll be in class alright?&quot; She asked, she really wanted 
Kai to tell her to stay, but felt like she would be more of a burden to 
the girl by imposing upon her request to be alone.

&quot;Yeah....&quot; Kai watched as a few strangling kids rushed for the school. 
She took a glance up at the building. She didn&#39;t feel like she belonged 
in such a place and at that moment really didn&#39;t want to be amongst so 
many strangers, &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot;

&quot;See you during lunch alright?&quot; Anita hesitated still fighting with her 
urge to rush over to Kai&#39;s side, but she had no idea how to support her 
friend. .

&quot;Sure sure...&quot; Kai said, she gave a silent plea that Anita would not 
leave her alone but could not find her voice to tell her that, &quot;Get 
going or you will be really late.&quot; She nodded towards the school and 
gave the girl a weak smile.

&quot;Later&quot; Anita quickly turned around and ran through the doors of the 
school, leaving Kai standing alone with only the winds to keep her 
company. 

Kai looked up at the sky and let out a tired sigh.
