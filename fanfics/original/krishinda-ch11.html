<h1>Prophecy of Krishinda: The Kusagana Myth (part 11 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/krishinda-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>It had been one day since Ryuma attacked Zaakumaikyuu and kidnapped 
Mitsuki. After nearly four hours of fighting against it, the people in 
Zaakumaikyuu had managed to overwhelm the fire. Nearly two-thirds of 
the city had been destroyed in that attack, and the Kiryu elders 
released an estimated number of twelve thousand mortalities. 
 
Most of the survivors were too shocked to believe that Ryuma had 
committed this atrocity, and assumed that one of the six devils were 
still alive. 
 
It was equally hard for the Heaven Slayers. Most of them had a 
difficult time in believing what Ryuma had done. But although Ryuma 
looked and acted differently then before, it was definitely him. 
 
They were currently in the Kiryu training grounds. Even though the 
place had been damaged, most of the grounds were intact.
 
Akira was in the back gardens of the training hall. Exactly where she 
was just a few hours before she started her journey, and before that 
animal, Ryuma handed her the Dragon-edge. 
 
All though she hated Ryuma for this, Akira mostly blamed herself for 
this situation. She felt as though she had allowed Mitsuki to be 
captured the way she was. 
 
Akira was slicing at the wooden training dummy she had practiced on 
since she was a child. It seemed that Akira went back to training 
whenever she had any frustrations that needed resolving. 
 
But strangely so, it would not work. The only thing Akira could think 
about was how she let Mitsuki down, and put her in danger in the 
process. 
 
{I put Mitsuki in danger...I did...}
 
Akira scowled and yelled brutally at herself, severing the 15&#146; inch 
thick wooden dummy into two pieces, with Dragon-edge. As the dummy&#146;s 
remains clattered to the ground, Akira sheathed her sword and turned 
around, only to see Miki standing behind her.
 
Miki had a sympathetic expression on her face. She could tell that 
Akira was holding herself responsible for Mitsuki&#146;s kidnapping. 
 
&#147;Are you okay, Akira?&#148; Miki asked.
 
&#147;I&#146;m...okay...nothing&#146;s wrong with me.&#148; 
 
Miki stepped closer to Akira, but was cautious. She seemed to be mad 
at everyone including herself. &#147;You cannot be blamed for what happened 
to Mitsuki. It is nobody&#146;s fault but Ryuma&#146;s.&#148;
 
Akira closed her eyes tightly, and turned away. &#147;It is my fault.&#148;
 
&#147;No it&#146;s-&#147;
 
&#147;Yes, it is!&#148; Akira yelled. &#147;If I had been stronger then I wouldn&#146;t 
have lost her! I could have protected her...&#148;
 
&#147;We haven&#146;t lost her yet, Akira...&#148; Miki said.
 
Akira&#146;s eyes took on a darker note when she heard that. Miki was right 
it was not over. Ryuma had Mitsuki in his possession, but this didn&#146;t 
mean that she was gone. Akira had one chance, and that one chance 
would be all she needed.
 
&#147;You&#146;re right. When I get to Tundrana, I&#146;ll rescue Mitsuki and then 
I&#146;ll find that psychopath and cut his head off.&#148; Akira said 
vengefully.
 
&#147;Assuming you have a clear head when you get there.&#148;
 
Akira quickly turned around and walked past Miki. &#147;My head is clear.&#148;
 
Miki sighed. &#147;I don&#146;t think it is. And if you do not calm down before 
you face Ryuma, you will just get killed.&#148; 
 
Akira tensed up in dissatisfaction, tightening her fist. She was tired 
of people constantly interfering in her troubles. 
 
&#147;Yeah, well that&#146;s my problem. Now will you do me a favour and mind 
your own damn business?&#148; Akira hissed.
 
The young knight walked away. Miki was taken aback by Akira&#146;s sudden 
temper, but she could understand why, even if Akira didn&#146;t...
 
**********
 
The next day, Akira, Genzo, Miki and Anju made there way north. They 
decided not to use the airship even though it had been repaired, only 
because they assumed it would give them away to Ryuma, and that would 
make them lose the element of surprise. So the team went to the Hikika 
mountain trail, and followed along for a few hours until they reached 
Tundrana. 
 
Tundrana is actually quite famous more being the site at which Ryuma 
destroyed Tensatsu, the most evil angel in the history of Juukumei. 
The whole of Tundrana was covered in snow and ice, and there was one 
big mountain even further north in Tundrana. 
 
Akira suspected that this was where Mitsuki and Ryuma were. Akira and 
the others were currently making their way across the snowfields.
 
Anju rubbed his hands over his arms repeatedly in an effort to keep 
warm as he walked.
 
&#147;Why is it so frickin&#146; cold here?&#148; Anju asked irritated.
 
&#147;Nobody knows why. Probably because this is the most northerly part of 
Juukumei.&#148; Miki stated. 
 
Genzo stopped walking and the others turned to look at him.
 
&#147;Genzo, what&#146;s wrong?&#148; Anju asked.
 
The ageing master looked around him, and stared up at the mountain 
about a half-mile away from the gang. 
 
&#147;I can sense Ryuma&#146;s spirit. He&#146;s there. In the mountain.&#148; Genzo said, 
trying to focus his mind&#146;s eye on Ryuma.
 
Akira clenched her fist, looked at the mountain holding her best 
friend and her enemy.
 
&#147;Then that is where we are going.&#148;
 
**********
 
The Heaven Slayers made their way to and climbed up the mountain that 
Genzo had pointed out to them. It was a difficult climb for them, but 
eventually they made it up to the summit. Unlike the rest of the 
mountain, the snow and the ground at this point was levelled out and 
even, and over in the distance was cave, carved into the very face of 
the mountain.
 
Miki said that it might lead to wherever Ryuma and Mitsuki were, so 
they decided to go through it. The team went into the narrow cave and 
it led them down a long spiralling crystal-like staircase made of ice. 
After walking down them, the Heaven Slayers entered a large chamber of 
ice, echoing, icicles hanging off the ceiling.
 
And off across the large chamber was the God of Destruction himself, 
Ryuma.
 
The man was standing across from the others, his arms crossed and his 
eyes revealing a perverted desire for death and battle...
 
Akira&#146;s eyes flashed with fury and she barged Genzo out of her way, to 
face the demon. 
 
&#147;Ryuma! Where is Mitsuki? Where is she, you bastard!?&#148; Akira yelled.
 
&#147;Heh, heh, heh, heh...all in due time, my little assassin...&#148; 
 
Genzo stepped forwards next to Akira and placed a staying hand in 
front of her. 
 
&#147;Hold on. Before we start, I want to know why you have done all of 
this. Destroying Zaakumaikyuu, killing people, kidnapping my 
granddaughter. I want to know why!&#148;
 
Ryuma uncrossed his arms and placed his left hand open. A dark energy 
manifested into the form of a sword, and the black spirit dissolved, 
leaving behind an elongated sword, with a striking similarity to 
Akira&#146;s Dragon-edge...
 
Miki gasped. &#147;The Mist-edge...&#148;
 
Ryuma laughed again. &#147;Well, you want to know some of my secrets, huh? 
I don&#146;t even care about what you want. What *I* want, is right 
here...&#148;
 
Ryuma looked at Akira. &#147;And now I will crush her!&#148;
 
Ryuma raised Mist-edge into the air, brought it down swiftly, whipping 
up a slash of energy. Akira, Anju, Miki and Genzo all jumped out of 
the way as the slash zinged towards them and blew up the entrance (and 
exit) to the chamber.
 
Genzo pulled out an ofudu, Anju took a fighting stance, and Miki and 
Akira both drew Kotetsuseiken and Dragon-edge.
 
The four stood defiantly before Ryuma, and the God of Destruction 
smirked at them, snorting briefly. 
 
&#147;So,&#148; Ryuma looked back and forth between them. &#147;The brave gang come 
to stop the maniac killer before he can slaughter the world...do you 
little gnats think that somehow YOU can end my life? If the greatest 
of all the angels could not stop me, what makes you think that your 
ragtag bunch is enough?&#148;
 
Akira steadied her sword. &#147;I couldn&#146;t care less about the odds! Where 
is Mitsuki?!&#148;
 
Ryuma looked curious for a second. &#147;Why...do you wish to save her?&#148;
 
Akira started to gather her Mana-Ki, as did the others. &#147;She is my 
best friend, and nothing will stand in between us. Not even you.&#148; 
 
&#147;So...I see that your eyes are not the only thing that is blind... 
despite your lineage you still protect humanity? I do not understand 
you...but no matter. You&#146;ll soon join me...in the darkness...&#148;
 
Ryuma pointed the dark Mist-edge sword directly forwards, and a dark 
beam of energy cut out from it. The others scrambled away from it as 
it neared them, and Akira took that time to charge at Ryuma.
 
The young knight slashed at him crudely, and Ryuma dodged the attack 
with a cruel smirk. Akira slashed at him again; this time Ryuma 
blocked it with his own sword. Akira struggled in vain to overpower 
Ryuma, both of her hands applying pressure to the Dragon-edge whereas 
Ryuma held the Mist-edge one handed. 
 
With a grunt of anger, Ryuma shoved Akira out of the sword lock with 
the Mist-edge, and smiled at her as she fell to the ground.
 
&#147;Is this all you have, Kusagana?&#148; Ryuma said smoothly.
 
Genzo sneered, and pulled the ofudu into the air. 
 
&#147;Heavenly thunder, smite my enemies with the fury of a thousand 
lightning bolts!&#148;
 
A giant wave of static electricity roared down on top of Ryuma, and 
enshrouded him in a destructive stream of fire and wind. An explosion 
boomed in the chamber, and Miki, Anju and Akira all crowded around the 
cloud of dust that remained. A cry of joy echoed around the room, and 
a gust of wind blew fiercely out of the dust cloud, dissipating the 
smoke and knocking the others off their feet.
 
Ryuma stood silently in the few remaining shreds of smoke, completely 
unharmed. &#147;Not bad, old man. Well, not bad for an old man, I guess.&#148;
 
Anju glowered at Ryuma, and gathered Mana-Ki from the depths of his 
spirit, charging up his main attack...
 
&#147;Mikazuki Gun!&#148;
 
A crescent shaped wave of pure energy fired from Anju&#146;s clutched palms 
and was directed at Ryuma. The God of Destruction raised the Mist-edge 
into air. The instant the crescent wave reached him, Ryuma sliced into 
the wave of energy, warping it and eventually bursting it. Anju looked 
away as his attack was crushed in a bang of light.
 
Miki took her chance and ran up to Ryuma, swiftly hacking at him with 
Kotetsuseiken. Ryuma blocked that with the Mist-edge, the friction 
from the two clashing swords resulting in sparks passing along them.
 
Closing eyes, Ryuma grinned to himself. &#147;Is this it? I was expecting 
something so much more climactic.&#148;
 
Akira&#146;s eyes narrowed, and she struggled to keep her anger in check. 
{That arrogant little...}
 
The young knight stumbled to her feet, and stood silently. A shining 
blue light surrounded her sword, and Akira pushed her foot back to 
steady herself.
 
&#147;Kyoretsuzan!&#148;
 
An intense wave of cobalt flaming energy tore from the Dragon-edge, 
and flung itself towards Ryuma. The God of destruction only splayed 
his arms out and welcomed the blast.
 
It hit him square in the chest, but instead of cutting through him or 
blowing him up, the Kyoretsuzan, Akira&#146;s strongest attack, dissolved 
into a meek nothingness.
 
Genzo, Akira, Miki and Anju gasped in shock, and Ryuma laughed out 
loud seeing that the attack did absolutely nothing. 
 
&#147;Heh, heh, heh, heh! Is that your best shot? Is this the power that 
crushed the devils? Hah, pathetic...&#148; Ryuma scolded.
 
The dark haired man brought Mist-edge above him again, his face 
turning darker, his eyes beaming a blood thirst. &#147;Let me show you what 
real power is capable of in the right hands...&#148;
 
With hawk like grace and speed, Ryuma leapt into the air, and the evil 
Mist-edge began to gather a mysterious black energy. The sword then 
started vibrating violently, so much so that Ryuma, with all his 
god-like power, had to hold it with both hands to maintain control. 
 
Then when he could no longer restrain the carnivorous spirits in the 
sword, he swung it down at the four below him. 
 
&#147;Shun Gyakusatsu Zan!&#148; 
 
An ENORMOUS wave dark wave of power collided with the ground and a 
gigantic explosion rock the chambers, and shook the very mountain 
itself. 
 
Smoke and dust were the only things Akira could see as she stood up 
weakly, taking note of the fact that the Dragon-edge felt lighter. 
Akira waved the smoke out of her way, and coughed a bit, but she still 
looked for the others.
 
After a few minutes of searching, the smoke settled down. Miki was on 
her knees, Anju was next to her trying to get up, and Genzo was face 
down on the floor. He was alive, but he wasn&#146;t moving.
 
She looked across to Ryuma. He landed on the ground with a satiated 
smile. 
 
Akira felt blood trickle down the side of her mouth. After she wiped 
it from her face with her fist, Akira started to seriously believe 
that they really *didn&#146;t* stand a chance. Ryuma did just wipe out the 
team with a single attack...
 
Ryuma laughed again. &#147;Aha, ha, ha, ha! Not as gung-ho now are you?&#148;
 
Akira was not prepared to give up though, and quickly held Dragon-edge 
up to her shoulder. Then she gasped as she saw *why* her sword was so 
much lighter then before...
 
It was broken.
 
The legendary, invincible Dragon-edge sword had been broken. 
 
Ryuma laughed out loud again, but Akira had no time to act however, 
because the icy ground beneath her began to crumble and shatter. The 
young knight fell screaming into the icy depths below.
 
**********
 
Akira groggily opened her eyes, meekly pushing herself up onto her 
feet. She slowly studied her surroundings. Judging by the hole in the 
ceiling, she had fallen quite a ways. The place she was in was much 
smaller than the upper chambers, and Akira looked around the cavern 
for an alternate way out.
 
But what caught Akira&#146;s attention was the thing that was in the middle 
of the room. Akira walked over to it, and studied it. It was a long 
stone alter. On top of it was a skeleton, its hands placed on its 
chest. It was obviously a woman. But the most peculiar thing about it 
was the pair of what appeared to be wings on its back. 
 
A spirit then gradually materialized from the bones of the long dead 
corpse. Akira stepped back as the spirit smiled gently at her. 
 
It was transparent, that was the first noticeable thing, but the sprit 
was of a woman. She had long white hair, her skin...pale, her eyes 
were a light blue and she was wearing a long, ashen dress.
 
Unsurprisingly, she had a pair of beautiful white-feathered wings 
jutting out from her shoulder blades.  
 
&#147;Don&#146;t be afraid...&#148; The spirit said. 
 
Akira recognized that voice. &#147;Who are you...you&#146;re the voice from my 
dreams...aren&#146;t you...?&#148;
 
The spirit nodded. &#147;Yes. My name is Yakuma. But I am known to you as 
Tensatsu, the darkest of all angels.&#148;
 
Akira was surprised. &#147;*You* are Tensatsu?&#148; 
 
&#147;Yes. Akira, there are things I should explain. Many, many years ago, 
there existed two races on Juukumei. The Humans and the Angels. Each 
lived in perfect harmony with each other, and shared the natural 
duties of the planet. However, a comet crash-landed into the earth. No 
one knows how or why, but soon after the crash, the humans became 
suspicious of the power of the angels. They became less concerned with 
the protection of the planet, and more concerned about their own 
personal desires. The humans grew to believe that the earth belonged 
to them, so they started a genocide war to conquer the angels. Ryuma 
Kakounji led this war. Although our power was greater, their numbers 
were far superior to our own, and eventually, we were overwhelmed. 
After decades of war, my race dwindled to a tiny handful. I realized 
however that Ryuma was not only a danger to the angels, but also to 
humanity. You see; he is neither human nor angel. He is the last 
descendant of an evil group that originated from that comet. He and 
his dark bride, known only as Ai, set about to fill the world with 
more of his kind, and kill off the creatures that inhabited the earth 
currently. He would have stopped the world, but we managed to kill Ai 
before Ryuma had the chance. He was consumed with anger when this 
happened, and he managed to convince the world that the angels were 
evil. Anyway, towards the end of the war, I knew that I had to stop 
Ryuma so that his power couldn&#146;t destroy humanity. I travelled all the 
way to Tundrana, and eventually I faced him. I did not have the power 
to truly stop him, so I did something different. I sealed all of his 
power into my soul. That way, if I died, he still couldn&#146;t use his 
power for darkness. For this act, Ryuma murdered me. When I died, 
Ryuma carved my soul into six pieces, causing a massive earthquake to 
rumble across Juukumei. Each part of my soul separated from the other 
pieces. The parts of my soul were not under the influence of my power 
anymore, and because of this, they were infected by his evil, and 
transformed into-&#147;
 
&#147;The six devils...&#148; Akira filled in.
 
&#147;Correct. They were scattered across the world, and attacked people 
indiscriminately. Ryuma knew that his plan would not come to fruition 
unless he had his full power, and that the only way to do that was to 
re-forge my soul and absorb his powers back into his body.&#148;
 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened. &#147;That was why Ryuma funded the Heaven Slayers 
and that was why he gave me the Dragon-edge...&#148; 
 
&#147;Right. Soon after this, Ryuma had told the world about the death of 
the dark &#145;Tensatsu&#146; and he became a legend. The lies were spread that 
the angels were an evil race, and were so attached to society, nobody 
bothered to question them. My race was forever tarnished and now 
almost completely gone.&#148;
 
Akira looked confused. &#147;You&#146;re the last of the angels? That can&#146;t be 
right...&#148;


&#147;No, it&#146;s not. I gave birth to a child three years before my death, 
and I entrusted that child to my husband, to protect her from Ryuma.&#148;
 
&#147;Your...husband?&#148; Akira asked.
 
Yakuma nodded. &#147;Yes...Hyudo Kusagana...your father.&#148;
 
Akira gasped breathlessly. &#147;Wait...that means that...you&#146;re my...&#148;
 
The warm smile on Yakuma&#146;s face grew. &#147;Yes. I am your mother, Akira.&#148;
 
The cogs started to turn in Akira&#146;s head. Things finally started to 
make sense. Her mother disappeared thirteen years ago. Ryuma killed 
Yakuma thirteen years ago...Yakuma was her mother...She had inherited 
her angel&#146;s wings from Yakuma. It all seemed so strange, but at all 
fit into place. 
 
&#147;...Mom...?&#148; Akira said nervously.
 
Yakuma&#146;s spirit smiled and hugged Akira warmly, kissing her on the 
forehead. Akira couldn&#146;t feel anything, but could sense it. And it 
felt so safe and warm to be with her mother at last.
 
&#147;Akira...my child.&#148; 
 
Akira thought out loud for a second. &#147;Wait, did my father know that 
you are an angel, Mom?&#148;
 
Yakuma pulled back. &#147;I&#146;m not sure. I never told Hyudo. I do regret 
that but deep in my heart, I felt that he always knew.&#148;
 
&#147;This is just so weird. I always thought that you abandoned me Mom, 
but it was Ryuma wasn&#146;t it...*he* did this! He killed you...&#148;
 
&#147;Yes he did. But you must understand the cunning of Ryuma, Akira. 
After my death, Ryuma realized that he couldn&#146;t kill the devils on his 
own. He needed someone as powerful as I was, and you, being mine and 
Hyudo&#146;s daughter, were the perfect choice for him.&#148;
 
Akira&#146;s fist clenched. &#147;So that man was only using me...he was 
orchestrating my every move...predicting each step...all so he could 
get his dark power back.&#148; 
 
Yakuma nodded. &#147;Yes Akira. Now you have to get back up there and 
destroy Ryuma once and for all.&#148;
 
&#147;But how? I can&#146;t even lay a scratch on him, and besides, the 
Dragon-edge was broken. I wont be of much use now...&#148; 
 
&#147;My child, in our race, there exists a legend. That the most powerful 
angel of all will be born out of the first ever union of a human and 
an angel. This is called, the Prophecy of the Krishinda. You Akira, 
are of human and angel ancestry. Within you lies the power of both our 
races fused into one. Have you ever noticed that you are never 
satisfied with your current power?&#148;
 
&#147;Yes...&#148;
 
&#147;That&#146;s because an instinct inside you that knows that there is 
something more worthwhile.&#148; Yakuma said deeply. 
 
Then, the spirit of Yakuma summoned a streak of lightning from her 
hand. It transformed into a lengthy broadsword, tiny traces of 
lightning flickering around it every few seconds. Akira recognized as 
her father&#146;s blade, the Lightning-edge.
 
&#147;The Lightning-edge...&#148; Akira said in awe. 
 
Yakuma presented it to Akira, and the young knight clasped it, still 
shocked over seeing this very blade. 
 
&#147;It was your father&#146;s sword, now it is yours. Go Akira. Go and finish 
Ryuma so my soul can rest in peace.&#148;
 
Akira&#146;s resolved hardened. She would do this. Ryuma had to be stopped 
once and for all. 
 
&#147;I&#146;ll do it Mom. I&#146;ll kill Ryuma, avenge you and the others, and then 
I&#146;ll free Mitsuki...&#148; Akira said. 
 
Yakuma smiled. &#147;That&#146;s your best friend, is it?&#148; 
 
Akira blushed a rosy red. &#147;Yeah...&#148;
 
&#147;Just promise me one thing Akira, Be honest with yourself. You&#146;ll lose 
something important to you if you don&#146;t.&#148;
 
Akira didn&#146;t know what Yakuma meant by that at first, but a wave of 
awareness descended on her. Her eyes shot open when she finally 
understood what Anju had said to her before Mitsuki&#146;s wedding.
 
Yakuma smiled sweetly. It took a while, but Akira finally understood. 
 
&#147;Now Akira, it is time to awaken your ultimate power...&#148; 
 
**********
 
Miki slashed at Ryuma again and again, but could not hit him. Each 
blow was either block or dodged. After a wave of slashes, Miki lowered 
Kotetsuseiken, and panted heavily.
 
Ryuma just frowned scornfully at the Soujumah priestess, and raised 
his free palm forwards, shooting a blast at Miki.
 
She felt like a mule had kicked her when she was blasted across the 
icy cavern, past Genzo who was still not moving. 
 
Ryuma walked over to her again, and raised his palm forwards again. 
Miki gasped in terror as the blast was fired at her. Suddenly, Anju 
dived in front of her and screamed out in agony as the dark energy 
drilled into him. The Second of the Twelve Dragons toppled over onto 
the floor, just in front of Miki. 
 
The hazelnut haired girl gently turned him over onto his back and ran 
her long fingers through his hair.
 
&#147;Anju...you stupid idiot, why did you do that?&#148; Miki asked caringly.
 
Even though he was really in no position to do anything, Anju laughed 
quietly to his former love.
 
&#147;Couldn&#146;t...let you die...now could I? I had to protect you, even if 
you&#146;re not...my girlfriend anymore...&#148; 
 
&#147;Anju...&#148; Miki chided.
 
&#147;It doesn&#146;t matter...anymore. That...sick little freak is gonna kill 
us...all. Already...taken out...Akira...just promise me, that you&#146;ll 
get outta here...please...&#148;
 
Tears started to reach her eyes. &#147;But Anju...I can&#146;t leave you.&#148;
 
&#147;Before you go, I have something to tell you...in Daitoshi, the 
day...I told you...I was cheating on you...&#148; Anju smirked cruelly to 
himself. &#147;I lied. I never...cheated on you...&#148;
 
Miki caught her breath. &#147;What?&#148;
 
&#147;You...heard me. I didn&#146;t cheat on you, Miki...&#148;   
 
&#147;If you&#146;re trying to make me feel better Anj-&#147;
 
&#147;No,&#147; Anju cut her off. &#147;Believe me, this...is the truth. I loved you 
with every beat of my heart...but you would have eventually...become 
the Soujumah clan&#146;s first female high priest if...you married that 
guy. So I told you the only thing that would keep...you away from me. 
And then I go and...find out that you left the clan anyway...pretty 
ironic, huh?&#148;
 
A tear slipped past Miki&#146;s eye. &#147;Anju...&#148;
 
Ryuma leered at the two of them. &#147;Pitiful humans. I&#146;ll exterminate you 
all...and rule the world after I am free of you.&#147;
 
Miki held onto Anju protectively whilst Ryuma neared them. &#147;Don&#146;t come 
any closer, Kakounji!&#148;
 
&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What is the matter my dear? Did you expect a 
fairytale ending? Sorry, but this is the real world and in the real 
world, only the strongest survive. And the weak get crushed 
underfoot...&#148;
 
Ryuma was cut off from saying anymore when a blinding white light 
blasted up from the cracks of the floor. Ryuma flew up into the air as 
the floor beneath him crumbled away.
 
From the white light, a shining figure bathed in golden energy slowly 
floated up from below. It was Akira, with the Lighting-edge sword in 
her hands, and a pair of angelic wings sprouting from her back. 
 
Miki and Anju gasped while seeing her, but Ryuma only smiled.
 
&#147;It seems that Yakuma&#146;s progeny is tenacious as well as powerful...&#148; 
Ryuma commented.
 
Akira&#146;s eyes opened as the golden light faded, and held 
Lightening-edge steady, gathering her power. 
 
&#147;I can never forgive you for what you have done, Ryuma...&#148; Akira said 
in strain.
 
Ryuma scowled at her. &#147;I&#146;ve had enough of your kind, angel. I am going 
to finish your miserable race once and for all!&#148;
 
The God of Destruction charged at Akira, with no remorse or sense of 
consequence. The great energy inside Akira passed into the blade in an 
easy flow, and as Ryuma swooped down upon her, Akira flung the energy 
charged sword into the demon&#146;s chest. Lightning-edge plunged into the 
chest cavity of Ryuma, and pierced his fleshy back. 
 
Ryuma coughed up blood as he looked into Akira&#146;s steely eyes.
 
&#147;But why...why would you fight to save the ones...who killed your own 
race...?&#148; Ryuma said difficulty. 
 
&#147;If I were to hate humanity for killing my race, I&#146;d only continue a 
cycle of death and revenge. Eventually a new race would come and a new 
hatred would be born. The cycle would spin again. A never-ending wave 
of killing and hate. But all things have to end. Nothing is forever 
and we all must go. Even me...and even you. Your life ends here 
Ryuma...&#148; 
 
Ryuma screeched in terror and suffering as Akira&#146;s golden energy 
burned inside the sword and was released into his dark influenced 
body. After pulling her sword out of his carcass, Ryuma continued to 
shriek in pain, each part of his body burning with Akira&#146;s power.
 
All at once the power was just too much for Ryuma to bear, and the God 
of Destruction&#146;s body blew up in a magnificent flash of light. The 
light from the explosion was so fierce, Anju and Miki had to cover 
their eyes to prevent from being blinded.
Eventually, the golden light died down, and Akira now was visible with 
a sleeping Mitsuki in her arms.
 
The Angel of Krishinda landed on the ground next to Anju and Miki.
 
&#147;Come on guys. Lets get out of here.&#148;
 
**********
 
The Heaven Slayers escaped the mountains of Tundrana, all managing to 
stay alive. They returned to Zaakumaikyuu after Ryuma&#146;s defeat, and 
had informed everyone of the situation. They had ignored all details 
about Akira and the truth about the angels from fear of upsetting 
them.
 
Akira was on the balcony of the now rebuilt Kiryu training ground. It 
was hard to believe that her battles with Ryuma and the devils were 
almost a whole year ago.
 
Mitsuki walked up behind Akira, and gently tapped on her shoulder.
 
&#147;Hey. Thinking about something special?&#148; Mitsuki said playfully.
 
Akira just smiled and pulled Mitsuki into her embrace. &#147;Yeah. You.&#148;
 
Mitsuki only giggled happily as Akira&#146;s soft lips descended on her own 
and drew Mitsuki into a loving, passionate kiss. Mitsuki&#146;s arms 
wrapped around her girlfriend&#146;s and the two continued to acknowledge 
their love before a beautiful crimson sunset. 
 
Anju and Miki watched Akira and Mitsuki from the outside hallway, Miki 
held warmly in Anju&#146;s arms.
 
&#147;I&#146;m happy for those two.&#148; Miki said.
 
&#147;Yeah. In the end they finally found each other. Kinda like us.&#148;
 
Miki sighed lovingly and pulled her love into a warm, equally 
passionate kiss. The two couples respectively displayed their 
affections for each other. 
 
Everything was finally complete. </pre>
