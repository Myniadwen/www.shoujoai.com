<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>      Abby awoke to find herself lying in her bed. That funny feeling had returned and she 
let out a sigh. In just about a week, she would cease to exist. When she sat up, she noticed 
that the Living Inferno was seated in the chair next to her bed. His eyes were closed. Abby 
stared at him, taking in the battered armor and drying blood that had seeped out of the 
cracks.

      He opened his eyes. &quot;...Abby... are you alright?&quot; She nodded and said, &quot;Yes... I think 
I may have shortened my time by pulling that stunt back there. I feel stranger than before.&quot; 
She looked down at her hands and then back at him. She could see the worry in his eyes.

      &quot;I... see. Isaka made quick work of Eska, so you don&#39;t have to worry about him. It&#39;s 
nighttime now,&quot; he murmured, looking over at the window. Abby looked him over and realized 
something. Krystal said she could treat his lesser wounds, but...

      &quot;You&#39;re still hurt, aren&#39;t you?&quot; He looked up at her. &quot;It is no matter. They will heal 
themselves.&quot; Abby shook her head. &quot;No, if you leave them, they will get infected.&quot; She 
grabbed one armored hand. &quot;I know you&#39;re scared, but please, take off your armor.&quot;

      He shook his head and withdrew his hand. &quot;I&#39;m fine. I don&#39;t require first aid-&quot; Abby 
just gave him a small smile. &quot;I don&#39;t want to have to use the guilt card, but... I don&#39;t 
have a lot of time left. A few days, maybe. I was hoping to see you before I&#39;m gone.&quot; She 
could seethe anguish in his eyes.

      &quot;But... what if you&#39;re disappointed...?&quot; he asked in a small voice. Abby rolled her 
eyes and got out of bed. &quot;I&#39;m going to grab the first aid kit and you&#39;re going to take the 
armor off. Those wounds need to be treated.&quot; He looked down at the ground in defeat as Abby 
went into the bathroom. The first aid kit was in the cabinet below the sink.

      Abby closed the door behind her before grabbing it. As she stood up, she caught a 
glimpse of herself in the mirror. Abby frowned at her appearance. She was in her mid 
twenties now. &quot;Tycara... you&#39;re making my last moments really strange, you know that?&quot; She 
murmured to herself, looking at her younger self.

      This was about the age she was when Terry died... no, maybe she was a bit younger. 
Terry. Abby smiled to herself. She knew her husband would be glad she found another... it 
was too bad she wouldn&#39;t see him in the afterlife. With a sigh, she picked up the first aid 
and headed out the door.

      Abby closed her eyes and then looked towards the Living Inferno. He hadn&#39;t taken off 
his armor yet. He was still sitting there, staring at the ground, lost in thought. When Abby 
cleared her throat, he almost jumped out of the seat. &quot;I can&#39;t bandage around your armor, 
can I?&quot;

      The Living Inferno stood up, anxious. Abby sat down on the edge of the bed and watched 
as he turned around. She would have been lying if she said she wasn&#39;t curious. His cloak 
blocked exactly what he was doing, but she could hear metallic clicks as he unfastened his 
armor.

      Abby&#39;s eyes widened as some sort of smoke/steam/mist seeped out as the pieces of armor 
started dropping to the floor. She couldn&#39;t see past the cloud and watched as most of the 
armor came off. The mist permeated the room and it had... a strangely clean scent about it. 
Abby watched as the silhouette of the Living Inferno faced her. He carefully unlatched the 
armor covering his face before letting his torn cloak fall to the floor.

      Abby stared wide eyed at him. This was... not what she had been expecting. The armor 
had made him seem bulky, but his frame was a heckuva lot smaller than she&#39;d expected. The 
smoke had completely cleared by now and the Living Inferno looked quite uncomfortable under 
her gaze. Maybe it was because she stared wide eyed for at least a minute before coming to 
her senses.

      &quot;You... you&#39;re definitely not what I had expected... I was thinking you&#39;d be a man 
with a lot of scars or burns, but...&quot; Abby started to giggle and then she started to laugh. 
&quot;Oh! I feel like total jackass! Do you remember that day I asked you if you wanted me to 
bear your children? How inconsiderate of me!&quot;

      The blonde mother just looked him over again. The reason she found it so horribly 
funny was... well, beneath his armor, the Living Inferno was a girl. A young woman, to be 
exact. Her red eyes flitted about uncomfortably at Abby&#39;s reaction and her cheeks were 
faintly pink. Her hair was long and a strange shade of snow white that made it seem so 
ethereal. Her skin was almost as pale as her hair.

      Abby stood up and walked closer to her. The Living Inferno took a tentative step back. 
The woman was a tad bit shorter than Abby and not quite as endowed, but... The blonde woman 
remembered why she&#39;d pestered him - er, or her, - to take off the armor. The young woman had 
nothing covering her body, save for a myriad of cloth loosely crisscrossing over her torso 
and her most private part.

      There were still gashes from Eska&#39;s knives and Abby pulled her over to the bed. &quot;I 
guess... we can discuss this... after I take care of your wounds.&quot; The white haired woman 
nodded and the gesture was the same as when she&#39;d been wearing the armor. Abby tended to the 
wounds with much concentration. Every time she touched the young woman, she let out a faint 
gasp. Abby decided to ask about that later.

      &quot;...then you&#39;re Tycara&#39;s mother.&quot; The Living Inferno nodded, her face displaying 
guilt. That meant... that meant that she was the one who killed Tycara. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I mistook 
you for a man. I probably made everything really awkward, huh?&quot; The woman only blushed in 
response and watched as Abby put away the first aid kit. All it took was a bandage here and 
there to patch her up.

      They sat side by side on the bed, silent. After a few minutes, white haired woman 
said, &quot;I... I knew you&#39;d be disappointed.&quot; She was gripping the bedspread so hard that her 
pale knuckles were turning pure white. Abby listened to her voice. It was so feather soft 
and faint, as though she hadn&#39;t even spoken.

      &quot;No... I&#39;m not disappointed,&quot; Abby said, taking one of her hands into her own. It was 
soft. &quot;Why would I be disappointed if I love you?&quot; She felt the white haired woman&#39;s hand 
clench her own. In the next second, she was holding Abby&#39;s face with both hands. &quot;You feel 
so nice... I... haven&#39;t touched anyone in so long,&quot; she murmured, hands running down the 
blonde&#39;s clothed shoulders and naked arms.

      &quot;Your hair is so pretty. I used to wonder what it would feel like,&quot; she said, running 
a hand through Abby&#39;s blonde hair. &quot;And your skin... so lovely.&quot; Abby smiled and ran a hand 
through the other&#39;s snow white hair. &quot;Tell me... your name isn&#39;t the Living Inferno, is it?&quot; 
She shook her head.

      &quot;My name...?&quot; The white haired woman thought to herself. It was a name she hadn&#39;t used 
in a long time. &quot;....my name is Sakura.&quot; Abby smiled, but soon found herself being hugged by 
the other woman. Sakura laid her head in between Abby&#39;s breasts, pressing her ear up against 
her heartbeat. &quot;Being able to feel you... touch you...&quot; She slipped her hands beneath Abby&#39;s 
shirt and splayed them across her naked back. &quot;You&#39;re... so warm.&quot;

      Abby said nothing and stroked her head. Sakura looked up hesitantly, staring at her. 
&quot;I want... to do more... but...&quot; Abby heard the unvoiced question. She&#39;d never considered 
being with another woman regardless of being surrounded by lesbians. She could see the 
growing doubt in Sakura&#39;s eyes. Abby took a deep breath. What mattered more...? Love or 
physical attributes? She loved Sakura, in a way, no matter how short of time it had been, 
but to love her physically...

      Sakura began to pull away. &quot;I... understand.&quot; Abby watched as she drew her knees to 
her chest and hid her face. The nearly naked woman gave off an air of depression. Abby only 
sat next to her, gripping the bedspread. Well, now she felt like a total ass. She remembered 
saying... she remembered telling the Living Inferno that... that if he took off his armor...

      Abby reached over and placed a hand on Sakura&#39;s shoulder. The white haired woman 
looked up, her cheeks already streaked with tears. &quot;I... told you that you could...&quot; Abby 
bit her lip nervously, but decided to get it over with. &quot;I told you that if you took off 
your armor, that you could feel me wherever you wanted...&quot;

      Sakura only stared at her, not moving or saying anything. Abby would have thought the 
woman died from shock, but then she felt a soft hand on one of her own. The blonde woman 
soon found out that Sakura wasn&#39;t patient for she kissed her gently on the lips within the 
blink of an eye.

      She pulled away, barely an inch and red eyes clashed. Abby&#39;s were wide in surprise and 
Sakura seemed just as dazed... so she kissed her again. Abby just sat there, trying to 
comprehend the kiss... or well, the fact that it wasn&#39;t as bad as she thought. Actually...

      Sakura pulled away again, but it was Abby who started the third kiss. It didn&#39;t take 
the white haired woman long to get the hint and soon, she was tearing at Abby&#39;s clothes. 
Abby was sure all of their kisses had been sweet and slow, yet... somehow, they managed to 
be haphazardly beneath the covers of her bed, both naked. Granted, Sakura was wearing almost 
nothing under the armor, but still!

      When Sakura pulled Abby into an intimate hug, the white haired woman let out a long 
sigh. &quot;Oh... Abby... you feel... you feel so soft... warm...&quot; Abby could feel her hands 
running all over her body, eager to touch more of her naked skin. She had to guess that 
Sakura being confined in that armor made her... well, made her extremely sensitive.

      Sakura rolled them over so she was on top, looking down at Abby with insecure red 
eyes. &quot;Do you... want to do this...?&quot; Abby&#39;s breathing was erratic, partly because she was 
nervous and their most intimate places were so close to each other. Mostly... it was because 
she didn&#39;t mind that it was another woman that she was about to do this with.

      &quot;Yes... although I don&#39;t know what the hell I&#39;m doing,&quot; Abby said honestly, pulling 
Sakura down to her. The white haired woman whispered in her ear, &quot;...neither do I...&quot; Abby 
would have giggled if she wasn&#39;t so messed up. She was sure Terry was rolling in his grave 
(or laughing in heaven) at the thought of her getting turned on by another woman.

      &quot;Abby... I want to kiss you and touch you everywhere... I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Abby shook 
her head at Sakura&#39;s words before stroking her hair. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare think I don&#39;t want 
this... if we stop now, I&#39;m going to be very cranky tomorrow,&quot; Abby said, joking. Actually, 
she was only half joking and Sakura knew that.

      Abby let out a little squeal as one of Sakura&#39;s ever wandering, greedy hands found her 
most sensitive place. The white haired woman kissed her and Abby reveled in it. She pushed 
out thoughts of Terry, thoughts of just everything. All she needed to know was that the 
person above her loved her and was someone she loved herself. 

***** 

      Abby was sure she was in a dream... it had to be a dream. She sat up and looked 
around. Instead of being in a field of white lilies, she was in a completely white realm. 
Weird. She lied back down and nearly jumped out of skin when she saw Tycara lying next to 
her. The young girl was still wearing a white sundress.

      &quot;You did it...!&quot; Tycara said, giggling. Abby gave her a sour face. &quot;Is this going to 
be some kind of guilt trip dream since I slept with your mom... uh... that feels weird to 
say...&quot; Tycara just shook her head, face now a slight shade of pink.

      &quot;Nope, I&#39;m not here for that,&quot; she said, suddenly hugging Abby and laying her head on 
her abdomen. &quot;I just wanted to tell you... that the seed&#39;s been planted.&quot; Abby just looked 
down at the silver haired girl. &quot;Which means...? Wait... ah, I see. You mean I don&#39;t have 
much time left, right?&quot;

      Tycara nodded and looked up at her. &quot;It should be less than a week when I start 
showing up... but you&#39;re still going to take care of me, right?&quot; Abby let out a sigh. &quot;Of 
course I am... I&#39;m giving my life for you, so why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot;

      The eight year old smiled widely at her. &quot;Good! Because I&#39;m your little guy, now...!&quot;
