&quot;The Day When a Whole Lot of People Got in Trouble&quot;

Abby Keeping had a tall order that one grisly January day. Whenever she 
wasn&#39;t teaching classes, Keeping was in charge of detention, and she 
usually had a full load at least once every week. This time, however, it 
seemed like it was the day when a whole lot of people got in trouble, 
and some of these were students who were normally &quot;good&quot;. Abby&#39;s 
&quot;regulars&quot;&#151;Ivory, X Walker, Allie Blair, Zane, Kula, Corona, and 
Ana&#151;were almost totally assembled, with some unusual exceptions. 
Aintzane was absent, what a relief, and so were Corona and Allie, 
perhaps off fondling each other in a dark corner of the school. This day 
was unusual not just because she had so many in detention, but a few 
were even teachers.

In order to fully understand everything, one would have to realize that, 
early on in her career as a teacher, Abby had volunteered to be 
detention monitor, claiming that a psychologist would be more suited to 
handle the girls&#39; problems than some poor soul who didn&#39;t want to be 
there at all. Of course, seeing as how she kept on getting the same 
people in detention time and again, those in charge, particularly 
Headmistress Marbel, wondered if she was really the right woman for the 
job. She struggled to keep her position, insisting that she could get 
through to the troublemaking girls yet. The absence of Klein and Blair 
was proof of her success.

Even though Marbel was strongly against suspension or expulsion, she had 
no objection towards good strong discipline, and had often meted out 
punishments herself. The girls that day were forced to converge in one 
room, teachers included, and were asked to reveal why they were there 
and what they could do to fix it. Abby had locked the door and stored 
the keys in a safe spot, so nobody would leave until she was satisfied. 
Strangely enough, Ivory volunteered to go first, and was asked to bring 
Blake up with her. Usually the brash girl was the most rebellious, but 
here she actually seemed remorseful (further proof of Keeping&#39;s success, 
perhaps?).

&quot;Uh, hey,&quot; said Tran, waving shyly. Blake crossed her arms. It wasn&#39;t 
her fault she was in detention. Ivory had started everything. &quot;Look,&quot; 
she continued, &quot;I know you all think I&#39;m a big pain in the ass and a 
bitch, but I&#39;m trying real hard to change. I&#39;ve been in here enough 
times to know everybody, but I really want to stop. Miss K,&quot; she said, 
nodding to the patient teacher, &quot;I&#39;ve been trying my best to behave, and 
you&#39;ve got to admit that I&#39;ve been doing better.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I do. But you seemed to have retrogressed earlier today. That 
fight you started did not look very healthy from my perspective.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have started the damned thing if miss druggie here kept her 
mouth shut.&quot; Blake snapped back.

&quot;Hey, some of us can&#39;t help what we&#39;re born with! So sue me if I forgot 
my meds and shot my mouth off!&quot;

&quot;How can ya forget something like that, specially if it makes you act 
that way if you do? You oughta be locked up!&quot;

&quot;Enough,&quot; said Ms. Keeping, raising arms and voice before the argument 
could escalate. &quot;We are not making progress with this bantering. Miss 
Baum, since your name comes first, why don&#39;t you tell me what happened?&quot; 
Blake sighed and ran a hand through her rusty hair.

&quot;She and I were working on a project together for Miss Madsen&#39;s class. 
We got picked randomly, which I didn&#39;t really like&#151;I would&#39;ve rather 
been with Mira.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so you can dry-hump.&quot;

&quot;Ivory.&quot; Keeping glared. &quot;Wait your turn. Continue, Blake.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, we were trying to do some research and I...kinda lost my train 
of thought. You know how I get when I don&#39;t take my meds. Anyway, Ivory 
lost it and started screeching at me. Now you know I can&#39;t help half the 
things I do when my ADD gets full-force, so I don&#39;t feel I&#39;m to blame. 
And you didn&#39;t have to hit me on the head!&quot;

&quot;You were being stupid and stubborn!&quot;

&quot;All right, that&#39;s far enough. Ivory, since you insist on interrupting, 
please tell your side of the story.&quot;

&quot;Fine, I will! Most of it&#39;s true, except this fucker here wasn&#39;t doing 
jack shit&#151;&quot;

&quot;Watch your language, now.&quot; Ivory snorted.

&quot;Anyway...she wasn&#39;t doing any work. I don&#39;t want a failing grade, so 
I...pushed her. Not physically, just...verbally.&quot;

&quot;You called me a cuntless ass-licker,&quot; muttered Blake. Keeping growled.

&quot;Girls.&quot; The two seethed.

&quot;All right, so what I did was wrong. I&#39;m sorry. But she didn&#39;t have to 
carry it on.&quot;

&quot;No, she didn&#39;t,&quot; spoke Abby, wanting to preempt Blake&#39;s rebuttal. &quot;But 
you didn&#39;t need to be so physical. And the fight that broke out between 
you two was inexcusable. You both know better. Now...you&#39;ve been through 
the wringer, and you both admitted you did something wrong. What can you 
do to prevent this from happening?&quot; The two girls looked down shyly, 
edging away from each other.

&quot;I need to...show more restraint,&quot; Ivory murmured. &quot;I need to keep 
reminding myself that I&#39;m trying hard to be good. I want to do good, but 
I need patience.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I could go easier on people too,&quot; admitted Blake. &quot;Plus, y&#39;know, 
don&#39;t leave home without my meds.&quot;

&quot;Is that all?&quot; The two girls knew what she wanted, an apology. They 
turned to each other and reluctantly held out their hands to shake.

&quot;Sorry I hit you and yelled. I really am trying hard.&quot;

&quot;You are improving,&quot; admitted Blake. &quot;Sorry I was such a...cuntless 
ass-licker.&quot; The room vibrated with laughter, and even Ms. Keeping 
smirked before dismissing the two. Next she called Ana Lu and Alisha 
Fox, who also had their share of problems. Ana was infamous in Stanton 
for her pranks, and while usually they were harmless and taken in good 
humor, a few had become too daring. She had constructed a trap where a 
bucket full of honey would drop on a person if they walked into a door, 
and the recipient of such a foul deed had been Alisha. Now the elder Fox 
loved pranks just as much as anybody, but having a bucket of honey fall 
on her head, drenching her hair which still stank in spite of the shower 
she took, made even her snap. She cursed up a storm, which was grounds 
enough for detention. She played her Tourette&#39;s Syndrome card as usual, 
but this time it failed her.

&quot;So,&quot; said Keeping, bracing herself for another conflict, &quot;who would 
like to go first?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah,&quot; said Ana. She smiled brightly at Alisha and declared: &quot;You 
can do whatever you want with me, but all I can say is that it was worth 
it. You looked so hilarious!&quot;

&quot;Hey, fuck you, bitch!&quot;

&quot;Girls, settle down. Neither one of you are expressing healthy traits. 
It looks like this is going to take some work.&quot; For the next fifteen 
minutes, Abby carefully listened and spoke to the two girls, trying to 
get them to admit to their wrongs, work towards redressing their awful 
habits, and apologize and make up. For Ana, it was a little more 
difficult, seeing as how she loved practical jokes. Abby got the idea 
that the blonde&#39;s girlfriend would have to act as a guard and make sure 
she didn&#39;t pull any outrageous stunts again. It was also agreed that 
Alisha could pour some honey in Ana&#39;s hair to make them even, provided 
she apologized for her language and literally washed her mouth out with 
soap.

Seeing Kula Nanahara and X Walker in detention was no surprise, but 
having them in there because of each other was new. Alexis had openly 
flirted with Kula in hopes of making her a girlfriend, but Kula, 
despising Walker&#39;s type bitterly, screamed back and hit her, hard. 
Unbelievably, it had been Usha who separated the two of them, but not 
before X got in a few licks of her own. Alexis gruffly but readily 
apologized, and was prepared to make up and get things over with, but 
Kula was stubborn.

&quot;Why are you like this?&quot; Abby wondered. &quot;Kula, you&#39;ve been like this 
since you came. Now we&#39;ve talked in private before, and you promised me 
you&#39;d try and adjust, but this just isn&#39;t working. I know how frustrated 
you are, but you just can&#39;t take it out on everybody. They&#39;re not the 
ones to blame.&quot;

&quot;Well I hate punks like her.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Because they&#39;re nothin&#39; but stupid druggies who smoke and waste their 
lives listenin&#39; to Marilyn Manson and wearin&#39; those stupid Goth 
clothes.&quot;

&quot;Hey, we&#39;re not all like that, Miss Hula-Kula!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that, bitch!&quot;

&quot;Settle down!&quot; Keeping had to physically stand between the two and act 
as a barrier to prevent bloodshed, and glared at them once a peace fell. 
&quot;Both of you control yourselves! It&#39;s no use calling each other names! 
Now Alexis, you&#39;ve already shown you&#39;re willing to apologize and make 
up, so if I were you, I&#39;d keep my mouth shut. As for you,&quot; she stared at 
Kula, &quot;you need to stop blaming others for your problems. If you need 
somebody to scream at, scream at me. Keep seeing me until your problems 
are gone. I know how hard it is adjusting to a new way of life, 
especially if you loved the old one, but that&#39;s the situation you&#39;re in 
now. Come on,&quot; she sighed, taking a weary breath, &quot;apologize. I&#39;m sure 
that if you got to know Miss Walker very well, you&#39;d think twice about 
her.&quot;

&quot;Not likely,&quot; murmured the girl. She scowled and said, &quot;All right, fine, 
I&#39;m sorry. There. Jeez.&quot;

&quot;Not very sincere, but I&#39;ll take it. If I hear any more trouble from 
you, Kula, you&#39;ll wish you were on cleaning duty again like at 
Homecoming.&quot; Most of the girls gave each other haunting looks, or at 
least those who recalled that terrible ordeal. Marbel had taken liberal 
use of her powers and had forced many disobedient students since then to 
clean the entire school campus, oftentimes by themselves. It was 
something nobody wanted, so better to swallow their pride than face the 
consequences.

It was uncommon to see Mira van Dijk in detention, and practically 
unheard-of to see Usha. Kula snickered as the poor Indian would-be 
diplomat was led inside detention with one of her girlfriends, and 
balked when the two stood up to recite their crime: they had been caught 
in the act of sexual congress, or as near to it as they had reached 
since then (there was no actual sex yet, but suffice to say that it was 
close enough). Abby was sympathetic to their cause&#151;oh how many times she 
had secretly snuck off with Hitomi for some naughty little romps!&#151;but 
she had to lay down the law. The two were given a warning, provided they 
promised to keep their hands to themselves and leave the sex at home.

Kula couldn&#39;t resist giving Usha a grin and a thumbs-up once her turn 
was over.

&quot;Well, now you&#39;re almost as normal as the rest of us!&quot;

Since Abby could only properly discipline the students, she merely let 
the delinquent teachers &quot;sit and observe&quot; her methods. She&#39;d then hand 
them over to Headmistress Marbel, who was not quite as kind and 
understanding as the young psychology teacher. Hitomi Madsen&#39;s face was 
bright red all throughout the trial session; she was hoping it wouldn&#39;t 
come down to her own girlfriend disciplining her (actually, Abby 
sympathized with Hitomi&#39;s cause and wanted to act as an arbiter, but 
Marbel wouldn&#39;t have it). Leena was black with guilt; Dr. Andrews seemed 
miffed at worst.

Abby had only one pair to go through before she let Marbel handle the 
teachers, and it was the least offending case. Poor Vicki and June had 
sat through the whole thing, more embarrassed than remorseful, and were 
dying to just get it over so they could go back to their lives. Perhaps 
waiting so long for their &quot;conflict&quot; to be resolved was punishment 
enough&#151;Abby smiled wearily at them and apologized. Their crime had been 
chatting idly during Latin class.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to have left you two as last,&quot; she said to them, &quot;but I 
didn&#39;t really think I&#39;d have to punish you for what girls will naturally 
do. Now I know that you two are in a relationship, and your groups of 
friends are intertwined, and I know that Latin can be dull and Miss 
O&#39;Brien can be a little too obsessive, so perhaps I can let you off with 
a warning. Just realize that you have the rest of the day and perhaps 
even all of your lives to talk. Asking for a few hours of your attention 
isn&#39;t much, is it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; they said sheepishly. She beamed lovingly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I sympathize. There are times I&#39;d rather be chatting with 
my friends too. You are dismissed; I&#39;ve made you suffer enough.&quot; The 
girls thanked her and left, Victoria dutifully wheeling her girlfriend 
out. Abigail sighed, and now that the room was empty of students, she 
knew that the real torment would soon commence. She gave her girlfriend 
a sad, supportive smile, squeezed her shoulder, and wished her the best 
as she left. Dr. Andrews raised an inquisitive eyebrow.

&quot;Hitomi, what did you do to land a spot in Stanton-Alcatraz? You didn&#39;t 
go streaking or break something valuable, did you?&quot;

&quot;No, I was just smoking on school grounds.&quot; Andrews balked.

&quot;That&#39;s it?! Is that the great big crime Bernie has you locked in here 
for? Jeez Louise! I&#39;ve done far worse and never once got her ire!&quot;

&quot;Yes, well, it wasn&#39;t exactly a designated spot.&quot;

&quot;But still! She ought to cut you some slack. At least I know what I did 
was wrong.&quot;

&quot;And yet,&quot; came a voice that was unmistakable, &quot;you did it anyway. So, 
did worse, have we? Pray, tell me more.&quot; Andrews crossed her arms and 
sniggered as Marbel strolled in, elderly, tall, and commanding respect. 
Madsen nodded humbly; poor Leena just looked up and went back to being 
miserable. Marbel was saving her most dreadful punishment for her.

&quot;Oh, come on!&quot; sang Andrews. &quot;If you don&#39;t have knowledge of my 
misdeeds, then so what? You&#39;re like a referee: if you didn&#39;t see it, it 
didn&#39;t happen.&quot;

&quot;Well then, let&#39;s concentrate on what I did see then, eh? I seem to 
recall it quite well! But please, pray, tell your fellow &#145;inmates&#39; just 
what you did. I want to hear it in your own words.&quot; Andrews shrugged, as 
if her crime wasn&#39;t all that bad.

&quot;I just snuck off for a little sex, is all.&quot;

&quot;You were both naked in the girls&#39; bathroom! And I may be in my early 
fifties, but I can still hear well enough to catch a certain orchestra 
of noises while chancing across the lavatories in the hallway! The two 
of you were quite loud.&quot;

&quot;Sor-ry. I tried not to yell.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not the point. The point is that you were shamelessly cavorting 
around in your birthday suit in the girls&#39; bathroom with another 
teacher! What if a student had come by and seen the two of you!?&quot;

&quot;They didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But I did. This sort of behavior is outrageous, and the only thing that 
is keeping you from being terminated from your job is your excellent 
record. By the powers of your skill alone are you saved, but I have 
moved to cut your salary in half for the next few weeks.&quot;

&quot;WHAT!!&quot;

&quot;You heard me,&quot; said Marbel coldly, matching the tall doctor&#39;s aghast 
stare. Poor Dr. Andrews was paralyzed&#151;she couldn&#39;t believe it! Half her 
paycheck cut, for several weeks? She may as well have been terminated! 
Yet Marbel stood with her decision, and released the doctor from her 
care with a stern warning: if she was caught again, or even if there was 
a rumor of it going around, the other half would go out the window, for 
good.

&quot;Now, Hitomi,&quot; said the Headmistress, her voice like steel. Madsen 
actually perspired. At least her girlfriend or her students weren&#39;t 
there to witness her humiliation. &quot;You know the rules of this school. 
You know that the students are discouraged from smoking. There are three 
designated places, though, and two for teachers, but if I recall, none 
of them were in the vicinity I caught you in. Care to explain yourself?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m almost clean, Bernie, I promise. I&#39;m down to only one pack a week&#151;&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask about your progress, I asked why you were smoking outside 
like that, when you clearly know it is against the rules.&quot; Hitomi&#39;s 
voice was caught in her throat. Yes, she was guilty, and she knew it. 
All she could do was apologize.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just...had a terrible craving. I have no better excuse.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps my punishment could help you with your addiction,&quot; said Marbel 
icily. &quot;Every morning when you arrive, you are to report to me. I shall 
then investigate your effects, including purse, jacket, pockets, car, 
and anything else that may hide a stash. If I do not find any 
cigarettes, I shall let you in. If I do, I shall ask you to flush them 
down my toilet, and I shall witness it personally. If you are as 
dependent upon them as you say, then this lack of nicotine will be 
torture enough&#151;but you will kick the habit eventually. Afterwards, you 
won&#39;t have any excuses.&quot;

&quot;Plenty of other teachers smoke, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Then you should have the sense to distance yourself from them. If I 
catch you again afterwards, Hitomi, you will be fined. It will be five 
dollars for every cigarette I see and forty dollars for every pack, even 
if they are empty. Do I make myself clear?&quot; Hitomi was crushed by this 
ultimatum, but what else could she do? She had been &quot;trying&quot; to quit for 
ages, and this is what it got her? She would indeed suffer, but she knew 
the consequences of breaking rules. Besides, what kind of a role model 
could she hope to be if she herself broke the rules?

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Good. You are dismissed.&quot;

&quot;Leena.&quot; It was now Miss Katajisto&#39;s turn. She gazed up sadly, bracing 
herself for the worst. &quot;We both know what you did. We both know why it 
was wrong. I&#39;ll give you the courtesy of not repeating it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; She sighed wearily. Bernie had caught Leena taking a shower 
in the gym...with Kathlyn Parkin. Marbel&#39;s sentence would be the worst: 
teacher-student relationships were looked down upon without mercy, no 
matter what the student&#39;s age or how close they were to graduation.

&quot;I&#39;m suspending both of you for two weeks,&quot; she said quietly. Leena made 
a face.

&quot;But you never suspend anybody.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m making an exception. I&#39;m going to punish you both by separating the 
two of you. You are not to come into any contact with Miss Parkin during 
this time.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; said Leena desperately, &quot;I deserve that and more, and I&#39;ll 
accept this. But Katt can&#39;t go back to her house; her father abuses 
her!&quot;

&quot;Why was I not informed of this?&quot; she asked coldly. Leena froze.

&quot;She...confided it in me alone. And I promised to help her. 
She...usually stays at my place.&quot;

&quot;That was not a wise decision to make,&quot; said Marbel darkly. Even though 
Leena was slightly taller and stronger, she shrunk back like a wounded 
puppy. She loved Kathlyn desperately, more than she had loved anyone in 
her whole life, save her parents and best friend, and keeping her away 
from her abusive dad was just one of the things she did for her. Marbel 
took a very deep breath and let it out slowly. &quot;I will allow Miss Parkin 
to stay with me for the time being. I shall do everything in my power to 
see her father is treated, and if necessary, arrested. I would much 
rather she stay in her home or even mine rather than yours, and I 
would&#39;ve preferred it if I had been made aware of this...but I suppose I 
can understand why. It&#39;s a part of who you are. You can&#39;t help but reach 
out to those girls.&quot;

&quot;...No.&quot; Marbel grew warmer and placed a hand of understanding on 
Leena&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I will do what I can,&quot; she promised. &quot;In the meantime, please consider 
what you have done. Do not think I am a heartless grouch; I just have no 
tolerance for that kind of behavior. Now when Miss Parkin has graduated, 
the two of you may move in and become lovers for all I care, and if 
that&#39;s what you end up doing, I bless you. But right now she is your 
student, and you should treat her like a student. Do you understand?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Good. We will discuss her living arrangements after the end of the two 
weeks. You are dismissed.&quot; Leena stood up to leave, feeling no better 
than before, but she was thankful Marbel had some mercy on her. After 
all, she could&#39;ve been terminated, deported back to Finland, or even 
arrested. Before she left, though, Marbel called out to her: &quot;Leena. You 
did look very happy with her. For what it&#39;s worth, I&#39;m glad you found 
someone to really love. Just be careful in the future. You are 
well-loved in this school, and I would hate to lose you to carelessness. 
Good-bye.&quot;

Leena smiled sadly, and walked out of the school and into the parking 
lot. For the first time in what seemed like eons, she would spend the 
night by herself, without dear Kathlyn at her side&#151;and it was only the 
beginning.

......

It didn&#39;t seem right for her to go home without making one last 
resolution, so Bernadette set off for the school kitchen, her final 
destination. She owed Sonia an explanation for what had happened between 
the two of them during the Winter Social, and needed to tell her that 
such a thing could never happen again. It would probably break the poor 
woman&#39;s heart, but better now than later. Sonia was alone as Bernadette 
came in, knocked politely, and smiled.

&quot;Hello, Sonia.&quot; The younger, taller woman grinned.

&quot;Oh, hello Bernie! Long time no see. Come in. Would you like some 
leftovers?&quot;

&quot;No, I just thought I&#39;d pass by before I went home.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well have some anyway, please. I made far too many and I don&#39;t have 
the heart to throw them out.&quot; There was a large box of crescent rolls 
sitting on a rack, and Bernadette took the whole thing, if only to ease 
the blow (plus, she had a weakness for them). She decided to speak her 
mind now, get it over with, and hope Sonia would understand.

&quot;Um, listen, Sonia. About what happened at the Winter Social.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; The cheer drained from her face as she looked away. &quot;I know, I did 
the wrong thing, and I&#39;m sorry. That sort of behavior is inappropriate, 
isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Well...yes, in a sense.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because we&#39;re coworkers, isn&#39;t it? You&#39;re my boss and I&#39;m just a 
teacher and chef.&quot;

&quot;Well...not entirely. I know plenty of teachers who have that sort of 
relationship with each other, and I have no problem with it as long as 
they keep business apart from pleasure.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Really! Well then, uh...is it because I&#39;m gay and you&#39;re, 
uh...not?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Marbel with a grin. &quot;I&#39;m gay as well.&quot;

&quot;Really! I had no idea!&quot; She shrugged.

&quot;A few of the teachers here know this, but it&#39;s a pretty well-kept 
secret. I guess I should have told you...&quot;

&quot;Then why was it wrong? Is it because of our age difference? Because I 
honestly don&#39;t care; I love you all the same. ...Ah!&quot; Realizing what she 
had said, Sonia turned pink, smiled bashfully, and looked away. 
Bernadette sighed, and reached over to touch the younger woman&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;That is partially the reason,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You&#39;re young enough to 
be my daughter. But that&#39;s not all. I simply can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care about the age difference,&quot; said Sonia with a noticeable 
shudder. &quot;To me, you&#39;re just a very beautiful and strong woman I felt 
drawn towards since the first day I came here. Of course, I also felt 
drawn to other women, even some students, but...there was an 
inexplicable attraction I felt for you in particular.&quot;

&quot;Sonia,&quot; whispered Marbel, &quot;we can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; She didn&#39;t want to look Sonia in the eye and tell her she was 
happily married; that would devastate her at this point. Love at first 
sight in spite of everything? She would crumble if she knew the truth. 
But she had to be told...

&quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Tell me, because I need to know. I love you.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;
