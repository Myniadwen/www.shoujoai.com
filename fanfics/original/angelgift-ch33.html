<a href="../original/angelgift-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>Explosions lit up the void as the ship suddenly
detonated, rubble expanding outward in a thinning
cloud of metal shards. &quot;No...&quot; Allison cursed softly
from the captain&#39;s chair, her sandy hair falling into
her eyes.

Amara spoke up from tactical, her black hair slicked
back boyishly. &quot;The Vigil is gone, but they got their
lifepods away,&quot; she reported tersely.

&quot;Multiple ships inbound,&quot; Sharin said from navigation,
moving the ship on her own initiative to avoid enemy
fire.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Commander Laurel D&#39;ken looked over at
Allison, the blue haired woman as composed as ever.

&quot;We need to cover the pick up of lifepods,&quot; Allison
said calmly, &quot;then we&#39;ll fall back to the planetary
defenses.&quot;

&quot;Should we alert the rest of the squadron?&quot; Ensign
Kayla Shen asked crisply, her pink hair tied back
neatly from her face from the communications station.

&quot;Tell Marilyn, Roma and Col&#39;Tyr to hold off for now,&quot;
Allison answered, &quot;I don&#39;t want the enemy to know we
have additional ships in system.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Kayla translated that on a encrypted
line.

Laurel looked over at the young captain, once again
feeling just a bit of surprise at how quickly the
young woman had slipped into the role. Allison had
grasped the tactical realities of the Liberty&#39;s Sword
instinctively, and each battle she fought against the
Star Empire she seemed to merely hone those dangerous
skills.

&quot;How many Star Empire ships are out there?&quot; Allison
asked calmly, studying the display on the bridge&#39;s
main screen.

&quot;Four light cruisers,&quot; Sharin answered promptly, her
blonde hair flowing gracefully down her back, &quot;we can
take any one of them, but as a group they&#39;re trouble.&quot;

&quot;We can see the four ships,&quot; Allison muttered to
herself softly, &quot;but what about electronic counter
measures?&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t have anything to equal ours, at least
according to naval intelligence,&quot; Laurel answered her
promptly.

&quot;I skimmed a few of their old reports,&quot; Allison
dropped her voice a bit as she reminded her second in
command, &quot;didn&#39;t they also predict that the Star
Empire wouldn&#39;t launch a military assault for at least
a year?&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Laurel admitted, &quot;we might want to do a
sensor scan, just in case.&quot;

&quot;On it,&quot; Sharin agreed. She manipulated the controls
on navigation, boosting sensor outputs to search for
any cloaked ships. &quot;There is another ship out there,&quot;
she murmured, &quot;trying to slip around behind us, ma&#39;am.
They&#39;re coming in shields off, to improve the cloaking
functions.&quot;

&quot;Plan?&#39; Amara asked calmly, fingers on her weapon&#39;s
commands.

Allison flashed her friend a smile, &quot;I want to let
that ship get as close as possible, then open up with
a full broadside.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll destroy that ship, you know,&quot; Laurel noted.

&quot;Even with our back up the odds aren&#39;t that good,&quot;
Allison said frankly, &quot;destroying that ship like that
will shake the other captains and give us an edge.&quot;

Amara flashed a grin, &quot;I like the way you think.&quot;

Sharin&#39;s voice was soft as she tracked the enemy ship,
the tension rising on the bridge as she read off,
&quot;Closing at 3000... 2000... 1500...&quot;

&quot;Now?&quot; Amara asked, hands on her controls.

&quot;Go,&quot; Allison nodded.

A command fired the thrusters, swinging the ship
around to line up the side of the ship to the oncoming
vessel, weapons ports irising open as they were
primed. The enemy ship tried to drop cloak and bring
it&#39;s shields up but it was far too late, the first
bursts of fire power racing in before they could
react. In a second or two it was over, the ship
spiraling off trailing wreckage.

&quot;Critical damage,&quot; Sharin cheered from navigation,
&quot;it&#39;s fusion core and drives are all down, the weapons
too.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Allison said, her own eyes focused on the
tactical display as they observed rescue ships picking
up the last few of their own lifepods. &quot;What about the
rest of the Star Empire ships?&quot; she asked quietly.

&quot;Moving forward, but hesitantly,&quot; Laurel replied
promptly, &quot;I think they were surprised we picked up
the cloaked ship.&quot;

Allison nodded after a moment&#39;s thought, &quot;Then I think
it&#39;s time to start pulling back to the planetary
defenses. We can do more damage from there, as well as
replenish weapons stores there before they try to
attack.&quot;

&quot;Signaling the squadron,&quot; Kayla answered, bending over
her communications station and going to work.

The Liberty Sword lead the way, the cruiser shining
silver against the void even as more silently three
light cruisers skirted the edge of the system under
their cloaks. The four ships gathered together at
Showalter, a industrialized world not too far from the
Throne World, and currently one of the targets of
raiding attacks.

Allison went into her wardroom just off the bridge to
signal Throne World, smiling as she saw the face of
her lover and future bride, Jenna. &quot;I wish I was there
with you,&quot; Allison said quietly, &quot;is everything all
right?&quot;

Jenna smiled tenderly, her black hair flowing down her
back in a graceful wave. &quot;It&#39;s all right m&#39;love,&quot; she
answered as a blonde catgirl held up a piece of
fabric, &quot;I can handle things here and we need every
captain in combat right now.&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s any comfort we&#39;re winning all our battles,&quot;
Allison smiled warmly, &quot;but they still have a powerful
numbers edge on us.&quot; She ran a hand through her hair,
&quot;And how are the wedding preparations going?&quot;

&quot;My mother is holding out for the grand ballroom for
the ceremony but I&#39;m trying to bargain her down,&quot;
Jenna chuckled, &quot;we&#39;ve got the decorations and food
planned out, though. Would you prefer to be married in
a gown or your naval uniform?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been much for dresses,&quot; Allison admitted.

Jenna smiled as she purred, &quot;Good, you look handsome
in uniform anyway.&quot;

Allison blushed faintly even as the catgirl attending
to Jenna looked amused. She still found it hard to get
used to, how the royals could speak so casually in
front of their servants. Speaking of servants... &quot;I
think Sharin is missing being pounced on by Milly, by
the way.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jenna dropped her voice, &quot;I was talking to
X&#39;tahn about it, apparently it&#39;s part of their
courtship rituals.&quot;

&quot;Milly and Sharin?!&quot; Allison blurted. She thought
about it a moment, &quot;You know, they do make a odd kind
of sense....&quot;

&quot;I thought so, too,&quot; Jenna nodded. The catgirl
attending to her said something softly and Jenna
sighed, &quot;I have to go... be careful, m&#39;love. I have no
intention of losing you.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Allison promised before Jenna was gone.

A few moments later Allison returned to the bridge,
where a young steward was dropping off drinks and
snacks for the bridge crew. &quot;I ordered a coffee for
you,&quot; Laurel said as Allison sat, &quot;I thought you could
use it.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Allison took a drink from the steaming mug.
It wasn&#39;t a real cup of coffee, of course, but the
local drink shared many of the same qualities,
including being a strong stimulant. Even better it
tasted like chocolate.... feeling a bit more peppy
Allison looked at the tactical screen, &quot;They&#39;re
holding back at the edge of our missile range?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Laurel agreed, &quot;we could try firing a
salvo off, but I suspect they could intercept them
easily.&quot;

&quot;So we wait,&quot; Allison sighed, sitting back and
drinking more coffee.</pre>
