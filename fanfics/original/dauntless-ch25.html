<p>“The  Space Race: a glorious gathering of dreamers!”</p>
<p>Keiko  Ozmund may have been socially awkward, but she wasn’t the type to  give up or back down easily. Since speaking with Lord Demise got her  nowhere, she was determined to see the Director herself, no matter  how much red tape she had to go through or how long she had to wait.  She was told the other woman was still on vacation, but would be back  on duty “soon”—just <em>how</em> soon was the question, and one that probably wouldn’t be answered. She  checked every day and made sure everyone knew that this  conference was a matter of urgency, even though in the grand scheme  of things, the Director might be too busy even to spare one minute. Two  long weeks passed since she arrived at the headquarters before  her patience finally paid off: one morning she was told that the  Director was coming in “sometime tomorrow”, and would do her best  to squeeze another appointment in. Keiko contained her relief and  thanked the informant, but this still gave her several hours to  endure.</p>
<p>A  minimum of pomp was observed when the Director’s flagship entered  military space. She didn’t like people making a big hurrah of her  comings and goings, and besides, too much attention tended to draw  the wrong people. Keiko woke up very early and was able to watch the <em>Circle</em> docking. An honor guard lined up to welcome the Director from her  vacation, with executives and war veterans alike saluting; Keiko was  forced to wait in her room. The Director breezily thanked them for  their devotion, said a quick hello, and integrated herself into her  job as if she had never left.</p>
<p>“By  the way, ma’am,” the register office manager reported, “Miss  Ozmund is waiting for you in Room 236-F. Mr. Schertzweimer put her  as your 0900. I can send a breakfast if you’d like.”</p>
<p>“Keiko? Did she really come to see me in person? Is her situation really  that serious? Yes, I’ll have the breakfast, please. Send a cart,  and be sure to deliver a hard copy of the report Schertzweimer made  for my absence.”</p>
<p>“Yes  ma’am. And if I may say so, welcome back, Director Astor! Did you  have a good vacation?” She smiled thinly and nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank  you, Mueller. I did enjoy myself. Now let’s get back to work and  make up for lost time.”</p>
<p>The  Director smiled humbly as she walked into Room 236-F, locking eyes  with her guest momentarily as she sat down. Keiko let out a heave of  relief and finally felt like she was going somewhere. A cart filled  with a variety of breakfast food and drinks wheeled in after her, and  the two women picked what they liked and started nibbling. The  Director also grabbed a folder from the cart and looked over it for a  minute or two.</p>
<p>“Just  let me catch up first,” she murmured. “I took an extra-long  vacation and now I have to pay for it. I must say that it was worth  it, though. I’ve been working hard ever since my inauguration, and  I needed a chance to sit still and enjoy myself. Do you ever visit  your family, Keiko? I’m not talking about your brother—I mean  your parents, cousins, close friends, things like that.”</p>
<p>“Not  as much these days. Kyle and I are busy. Can you really talk to me  and read at the same time?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Just  polite chatter. I don’t have any biological family left, so I had  to visit the people I considered my…extended family. Old friends  from long ago…and it seems more and more of them are leaving me. Well, that’s the way things go. How is Kyle doing, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Well,  on the surface, he’s trying not to let this new issue bother him. You know, we’ve already registered for the upcoming race.”</p>
<p>“Ah  yes, and we’ve got somebody from headquarters taking part as well. My team won’t give any quarter this year.” Keiko grinned and  brightened up.</p>
<p>“Why  Director, are you challenging me?”</p>
<p>“We  are up against a worthy opponent,” she answered calmly. She took a  deep breath and finished skimming over her report. “It says here  that Captains Chuunaru and Rover ran into a considerable deal of  trouble recently. We had to sacrifice one of our ships to lure the  Dead Rose pirates into a trap, but that ultimately failed. Apparently, an old friend of your brother’s was also involved.”</p>
<p>“I  can’t imagine who that might be,” Keiko replied honestly.</p>
<p>“It  doesn’t  really matter. The point is that for awhile, your pirate  problem wasn’t as great as you feared. I’m not calling you a  liar, Keiko; Chuunaru and Rover just did a good job of relieving you.  I’m sure the Ozmund Company made some significant headway since  then.” She put her report away and ate quietly; Keiko followed  suit, but felt as if a cold darkness had permeated the room.</p>
<p>“I  haven’t spoken to my brother much since coming here. I was  honestly hoping you and I could talk.”</p>
<p>“You  seem  to be under the impression that your trivialities don’t  concern me, because I’m far too busy handling much greater affairs.  Lord Demise is quite good at giving people the wrong impression. Yes, I  know you spoke with him. Why else would you be so  apprehensive? I’m an incredibly busy woman, Keiko, but the fact is  that your company concerns me a great deal. Establishing  communication and gaining knowledge of the unknown worlds out there  is crucial for every intelligent species. It is the job of the  United Cosmic Military to protect all civilians from that which they  cannot protect themselves against, and the alien forces you’ve been  running into—hostile species, pirates, bandits, whatever you  like—are indeed a significant threat.”</p>
<p>“It  sounds like you’re preparing to disappoint me, Director,” Keiko  murmured. The older woman stopped eating and stared at her dead in  the eye.</p>
<p>“Officially,  that is exactly what I must do, Keiko, and I am sorry. But believe  me when I say it’s no choice of mine. Let me speak with you  informally for a few minutes.” She raised her neck and touched a  lapel pin on her suit collar, then squeezed one of her earrings. “I’ve turned the bugs off, but they can’t stay that way for  very long, or security will become concerned. My accessories enable  everyone to listen in and record whatever I hear, so what I say now  must be kept in the strictest confidence. You are one of the few  people I can really trust.” She took Keiko by the hand, and the  young woman nodded.</p>
<p>“I  understand, Clarissa. Should I tell Kyle as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes,  but make sure you’re alone. There is an outside force infiltrating  the UCM, and I’m almost certain it’s stretched into Demise  Industries as well. I can’t present any facts, but I’m in a  position to…notice things. This force is restricting our movements  and keeping our influence in check—basically putting a fence around  us. I think it all started before I became the Director, and  whoever’s behind it has been trying to use me for their own  purpose. The military cannot come to your aid, and neither can  Demise Industries. You’ll be left to fend for yourself. </p>
<p>You’ll  soon have no choice—either abandon exploration or take this  mysterious offer. You and Kyle will have to figure out which works  out best for you. I can’t give you any better advice; I’m being  buried behind meaningless tasks and fruitless missions. What I can  say is that after this race is over, you’ll have to forget about  asking me for help in this matter. Believe me, I would if I could,  but I’m being held back. We’re almost out of time; I’d better  turn the bugs back on.”</p>
<p>While  the Director was reactivating her devices, Keiko sat stunned in her  chair, still holding her cocoa and muffin. She had originally  thought it was mere economics or politics that was preventing anybody  from increasing protection on those outlying ships, but now a more  sinister thought had been suggested. Whoever was pressuring the  military to keep away from its duties must’ve been so quiet and  discreet about it that people didn’t even notice it, or else they  accepted it. The change must’ve been very gradual, and made over a  long period of time. As the parable went, a frog thrust into a  boiling pot of water will jump out, but one thrown into a lukewarm  pot that is incrementally brought to scathing will not even notice  its own demise.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but try to understand my  position,” the Director said, though it was probably meant to  please her eavesdroppers more than Keiko’s temperament. Her eyes  were dark and morbid; she was expressing her true feelings even as  her sweetened veneer was covering all the bitterness. “I am sorry  I made you wait all this time. How would you like for me to make up  for it? If we both have representatives going into the race, I could  personally escort you to the Hagan system. You’ll have to wait  another week, of course, but at least now you’ll be my guest. I  hope that’s not too presumptuous of me—I know your schedule’s  as demanding as my own.</p>
<p>“No,  I would like that.” Keiko smiled frailly and stood up, taking some  food with her as she bade the Director farewell. They shook hands  and exchanged one last glance of understanding before the meeting  ended.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Because  the honor of hosting the Galactic Space Race had been fiercely  competitive during its early years, potential candidates were  selected randomly. Most computations took length, difficulty, and  safety of the courses into mind as they were tabulated, but there  were also factors such as number of habitable worlds (to hold the  billions that crammed in to watch) and frequency of hosting to  consider. Nobody wanted to give any system or species an unfair  advantage, which ultimately meant that most hopeful candidates would  have to wait decades for their chance. Even when the length of time  between races was reduced from five years to three, many systems  started screaming in protest, so now a bi-annually system is being  proposed (annual meetings were out of the question, as worlds and  pilots needed time to prepare).</p>
<p>The  Hagan system had been overlooked for years, so one can only imagine  the excitement generated when they were announced as the new host  eighteen standard months earlier. It took them almost that entire  time to set things up for the grand event: a set course had to be  determined, and special teams had to sweep the entire run to make  sure it was as safe as possible. There was really no such thing as a  perfectly harmless Space Race: few pilots escaped completely  unscathed, and several had even lost their ships or their lives  during the course. But </p>
<p>that  was all part of the life-or-death drama, the struggle for glory, and  of course, the chance for everyone else to advertise their  businesses.</p>
<p>As  a rule, the hosting planetary system could not have any  representatives in the race, nor could any citizen fly a private  vessel. The rules did mention that citizens of the worlds could be  counted as <em>crewmembers</em>,  but  only on ships registered as independent class. This rule was put  into effect to minimize cheating and unfairness, and it was strictly  observed. All participating ships, pilots, and crew were also put  through a meticulous inspection and background check, and more often  than not, hopeful cheaters were spotted and immediately disqualified.  Ships could not use offensive weaponry to attack one another, nor  could they engage in reckless aggressive acts (though this rule was  bent sometimes), nor could they use any fuel that was not recognized  by the racing commission (which meant Lennethium was permissible, but  Rachel’s teleportation was out of the question). Usually, the  pilots were required to go around the course only once, passing all  the checkpoints along the way, but sometimes in a smaller system,  they could circle three or even five times.</p>
<p>Herut  pressed herself against the observation window, clouding the panes  with her melancholy breath. The Hagan system, particularly planets  number eleven and seventeen, was her birthplace; this was where she  was born, modified, and raised for most of her life—and this was  where Chandra kidnapped her and took her on the worst joyride of her  life. But all things considered, it didn’t seem so awful anymore. At  least she got to meet a lot of people and see a lot of places, and  she even got to live as a real human again, and not just another  model expected to do her job. She smiled softly as they docked and  went through customs.</p>
<p>“You’d  better be careful with some of them,” she said, indicating the  women behind her. “There are a few bad eggs in our basket. Some  are even wanted criminals.”</p>
<p>“The  police turn a blind eye during the race, so don’t worry about it,”  the customs officer explained. “If we went after every criminal  and bounty-head that came to these races, there wouldn’t be anybody  left to participate! Of course, after the one-day grace period they  get when it’s finished, all bets are off. Just relax and enjoy  yourself. We have you registered in the Coloniensis Hotel.”</p>
<p>“<em>That</em> place?! Sheesh, Aseria’s dad really went nuts—not that I’m  complaining!” She moved along and waited for her companions to  trickle through. Herut hoped that the processors would find some  fault in Chandra and ban her from participation, but as always, she  had no such luck. At least she didn’t flirt her way through.</p>
<p>One  of the great wonders of the Milky Way galaxy was the docking bay for  ships registered at the space race, and it was the only one that was  both mobile and manmade. The large numbers of vessels taking part in  the competition were all lined up one after the other, with their  respective crews, mechanics, and sweeper teams giving them a last  inspection. The contrasting variety—size, shape, color, design,  capabilities, and notoriety—meant that one could actually acquaint  themselves with the galaxy as a whole just by taking a cart and  driving down the long lane. Every major species and business was  represented here, including amateur pilots, mixed crews, and unsung  heroes with beautiful dreams. Dozens—hundreds—sometimes even a  thousand different vehicles would blur by, each one as magnificent as  the one before. Many were familiar and even famous: theirs was the  stuff of legends, commanded by heroes and celebrities and champions  of years before. But there were always just as many newcomers, and  seeing so many fresh faces brought new excitement and rivalry to  every race.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It  was  impossible to not see a familiar face wandering around the  docks—and it was impossible not to make a new friend, either. Strong  bonds of love, trust, and friendly competition were being made  all time, and plenty of those relationships went on to become deeper  and more intimate. Racers would struggle against each other, fall in  love, and have children who would carry on the tradition. Of course,  just as many enemies were made as well, but it was better for them to  fight on the course than on a battlefield. Once the <em>Dauntless</em> was in position and her crew settled in, they went about exploring  the mythical docks in search of their competitors.</p>
<p>Kayleigh  and Teleah, who had been unanimously selected as the ship’s pilots,  took their time looking around. They felt a surge of pleasant  surprise as they came across the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> and her salty crew (with two new royal additions chipping in), and  several pirates waved and made friendly catcalls. Rose herself came  out and blew them a kiss.</p>
<p>“Ah,  I was hoping we’d run into you ladies again! I didn’t think you  could resist the allure of the race. Hey, are you free anytime later  today? What about tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“I  think we’ll be busy until the race starts,” Kayleigh shouted (the  noise in the docks was staggering).</p>
<p>“Why,  are you asking us out on a date?” Teleah added saucily. Rose  grinned and swung down on a rope to their level.</p>
<p>“I  was  hoping we could do more than just date,” she purred silkily. Teleah  giggled and gushed with excitement; Kayleigh merely blushed. “Listen,  uh, whaddya say we get together soon after the race, huh? We’re  actually busting our butts right now, but we won’t have  anything to do once we take the prize.”</p>
<p>“You  seem confident!” Teleah exclaimed. Rose shrugged coolly.</p>
<p>“I  figure we’ve got as good a chance as anybody. Cirrus and Alto are  a godsend, let me tell you…and if you even think about playing hard  to get, I’ll kidnap both of you as well.” She kissed their hands  and winked; the other pirates were hooting and hollering, so Rose  forced herself to break away and reprimand them. “All right, ya  swarthy swine, get to it! I won’t fall behind on account of your  lazy asses!”</p>
<p>Amy  knew she’d have a tough time getting around, so she rented a cart  and asked Alala to drive her around. The perky catgirl was only too  happy to help: one, it gave her a good excuse to dodge Yenae’s  teasing; two, it gave her the chance to get closer with the woman she  had a crush on; and three, she always wanted to try her hand at  driving. The last excuse didn’t turn out so well, and she nearly  ran over a group of people before jerking to a halt. Amy was  clutching onto the cart’s support for dear life; her hands and face  were white with sudden fear. She still smiled, though, and forgave  Alala for her inexperience, but decided to teach her new friend the  basics before she really did some damage.</p>
<p>“You  only need to use your right foot, so just relax the left. When you  drive, take it slow at first—don’t press the accelerator until  you’re comfortable with the handling. And when you’re turning or  stopping, ease into the brake, don’t smash it. You also don’t  need to jerk the wheel around so fiercely; a little subtlety goes a  long way. Be sure to signal when you turn, and watch out for  pedestrians and other vehicles. Just relax and take things slowly. There, see? It’s not so hard!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You’re  right!” Alala said, laughing shakily. “It’s kinda easy once  you get the hang of it. I’m still a little nervous, though, and I  notice all the other carts don’t really like how slow we’re  going.”</p>
<p>“They  can go around you if they’re in a hurry. The speed limit here is  pretty low, so they shouldn’t be in such a rush. Just take your  time and relax. Wait, slow down. Slow down, please. Ah, very  good—you did that well! Excuse me.” Amy hopped out, forgetting  her crutch, and hobbled as fast as she could towards a sleek-looking  vessel and her large crew, wincing and hissing but otherwise ignorant  of the pain. Alala made a face, grabbed the forgotten cane, and  hurried after her friend. She skidded to a halt and stood back in  befuddlement as she saw Amy tackling a tall man from behind.</p>
<p>“Kyle!!”</p>
<p>“Hyack!! Who the heck’s doing this? Someone ran into…WHOA, AMY!! Amy  Miracle! How the heck are ya?!”</p>
<p>“I’m  wonderful!”  she exclaimed as they embraced. Alala’s mouth hung  open and her eyes bulged out. Did Amy actually have a boyfriend? They  certainly acted as if they had known and loved each other for  years; their conversation and gestures were animated and intimate;  they were in another world, and she was left alone. But soon Amy  called her over, smiling brighter than Alala had ever seen her, and  drew her close once she caught up.</p>
<p>“Kyle,  this is Alala, one of the new friends I’ve made. Alala, this is  Kyle Ozmund, co-founder and co-owner of the Ozmund Company. We used  to be classmates awhile back!”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  almost half a lifetime ago!” he answered, smiling handsomely. Alala took one look at him and couldn’t help but blush. He wasn’t  especially pretty or handsome, but he had a wholesome honesty about  him—a purity, a love and an excitement that attracted people to his  side. He had trustworthy eyes and a smile that really showed he was  ready for whatever life had to throw at him, but he also had the  drive and the thirst for adventure that had made the Ozmund Company  what it was. He and Amy were really alike in that regard.</p>
<p>“I  wish I had heard more about Amy’s friends,” Kyle said as he  stared at Alala, rubbing his chin in thought. “She always could be  intimate with just about anybody. She must make you feel like you’re  the most wonderful person around.”</p>
<p>“Uh,  yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Just  try not to fall too deeply in love with her!” he warned, ribbing  Alala playfully. “Amy always had lots of fans back when we were in  school. Men and women alike couldn’t resist her, even though she  doesn’t mean to be that way. I was the same way, of course; I just  learned how to profit by it. It’s Keiko who was the odd one out. Hey Amy, <em>have</em> you seen my sister anywhere? She went off to see Clari—I mean,  Director Astor the last I heard, and I never got any reports.”</p>
<p>“Keiko  and I haven’t spoken in years,” Amy replied in disappointment. “I thought she’d be here with you. Maybe she’s still with the  Director.”</p>
<p>“So  wait!” Alala exclaimed suddenly. “Do you two really know the  Director of the United Cosmic Military?!”</p>
<p>“Not  personally,” Kyle replied vaguely. “We’ve crossed paths now  and then. We’re sort of…business associates. You know how the  leaders of two different companies might get together every now and  then for a social hour, or a business proposal? It’s the same with  the three of us.”</p>
<p>“Oh. What about you?” Amy took off her glasses and wiped them  carefully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I  met her a few times before she became the Director. She was actually  closer to my parents. So Kyle, are you entering the <em>Zephyr</em> again?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  but it hasn’t been the same since last time.” He glanced up at  the ship representing the Ozmund Company, the <em>Zephyr</em>,  which had won the race a few times before. A crew was working on it  and coaching the pilot; Kyle dug into his pockets and frowned  wistfully. “That girl’s seen too much action in her time. I  really wanted to retire her, but the fans keep asking for more. I’ve  announced that this’ll be her final race, so hopefully we’ll give  her a decent sendoff. We should have the <em>Zephyr-3</em> model in by the next race, but the fans won’t like it. ‘Don’t  screw with a classic’, they say, even though this old model’s got  more bugs than the hotel we’re staying at.” Amy chuckled softly;  Alala stood quietly transfixed. Her mind was still on the  relationship between these two people, and what it portended for her.  Kyle had warned her not to fall in love with Amy. Was that just a  friendly joke, or did he speak from experience?</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Rebecca  was separated from Riene during the confusion, and she regretted not  being able to spend time with her, but she had Mink, Shana, Lyara,  and Kate for company, so she really couldn’t have asked for much  better. The five of them were wandering the docks aimlessly, trying  to spot out the competition when chance caught Rebecca’s eye and  drew her to a very familiar vessel. She ran as fast as she could,  weaving and squeezing her way through the crowds, and called out to  the pilot with a shout. A cool, sexy-looking blonde woman about  fifteen years older than Rebecca turned around sharply, gasped in  surprise, and flung her arms around the sprinting girl. It was her  aunt Shandra.</p>
<p>“So  this is the famous bounty hunter I’ve heard so much about,” Lyara  remarked as they were all introduced. Shandra kept her smile  reserved and studied each of Rebecca’s companions with careful,  hardened eyes. She didn’t seem the type of woman to suddenly burst  out laughing, and her beauty was hard and weathered: she had seen  much and had lived through many struggles and battles. But for all  her grim features, she was as sincere a person as you could ask for,  and spoke firmly and wisely, always with love and conviction, and  could be relied on when everything else failed.</p>
<p>“I’m  glad my niece told me you were all with her,” she stated seriously,  crossing her arms. “Normally I’d bring you two in to the local  authorities. There is still a bounty for Lyara Tanith and Kathleen  Shepherd, but because the police don’t get involved during the  race, and because Becky has vouched for you, I’ll let you go.”</p>
<p>“There’s  a bounty on my head too, ya know,” Rebecca snorted defensively. Shandra nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes,  I  know, but only a fool would go after you. I know you didn’t try  to kill that man. I’m surprised Kaylee still lives on that world. Once  I’ve finished with the race, I plan on visiting her again. Maybe you  can come with me and convince her to leave.”</p>
<p>“Good  luck with that,” Rebecca murmured. “Mom’s really attached to  that world. It is where she and my father met…and where they got  married…and where I was born.”</p>
<p>“Frankie  didn’t seem too attached,” Shandra said bitterly. “He didn’t  have any problems leaving both of you behind. I still don’t see  how the two of us are related. Umm, I’m talking </p>
<p>about  my brother Franklin Baker, Becky’s father.” Shana, Kate, and  Lyara nodded quietly, now understanding why the two women didn’t  really resemble each other.</p>
<p>“Anyway,”  Rebecca said, “I do hope that mom decides to move away, even if she  doesn’t go running around with you. She’s too good for that  world. So how’s the ship?”</p>
<p>“<em>Prince  Mishkin</em> is still running strong,” Shandra reported. “I’m hoping to do  better this time around. Why don’t you come join me, Becky? I  could really use your help.”</p>
<p>“No  thank you,” she blushed. “I’m actually part of another crew  now, the <em>Dauntless</em>.”</p>
<p>“Oh  yeah, I think Kaylee told me about that. Isn’t that the ship run  by Dr. Miracle?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  but…the doctor’s not nearly as mysterious or enchanting as you  might think.”</p>
<p>“So  you’ve really <em>met</em> him…or her…or whatever?” Rebecca nodded her head quietly,  while the others gradually began moving away. They all felt like  they were imposing on an important family moment and didn’t want to  get in the way. Shandra noticed them and waved.</p>
<p>“Oh,  sorry for ignoring you all. Becky and I just haven’t seen each  other for awhile and…you know. Maybe we could get better  acquainted later. Umm, you, young lady—“</p>
<p>“Shana,  ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Ah  yes. Shana, you might want to look out—I think somebody’s  following you.” She squeaked sharply and whirled around, ready to  defend herself against any pervert or stalker. What she saw, though,  was a boy about her height, though much younger, and behind him was a  well-dressed woman around Rebecca’s age, and a very fat  blue-skinned creature wiping his immense forehead with a cloth.</p>
<p>“Peek-a-boo!”  the boy shouted proudly. He bowed suddenly, sweeping his arm  elegantly as he reached for Shana’s hand. “I’m totally  enchanted to meet you. Hey, there’s a whole bevy of babes standing  around! This is awesome! It’s totally my lucky day!” Kate  stepped up and dragged Shana away, glaring icily at the boy.</p>
<p>“Hey,  who do you think you are, treating her like that? And how long have  you been following us?”</p>
<p>“Not  long  enough, from the looks of it!” he purred, grinning rakishly. “So how  many more are you? That white-haired chick really looks  like she’d be my type, but I wouldn’t mind snuggling up to that  Yun, either! Not that there’s anything wrong with muscular  women—hubba, hubba! But girls closer to my age might prove more  satisfying in the end. YEEEAAAAUUUGH, why can’t I just have them  all?! Why should I be cursed with only one wife?! I’d like to  spend my whole life surrounded by girlfriends, but it’s just my  rotten luck to be forced out of bachelorhood!”</p>
<p>Blink,  blink. The woman and the fat creature groaned wearily and  interjected before the boy could be assaulted.</p>
<p>“Young  master, do you <em>really</em> have to make a scene EVERY time you see a girl? You’re only twelve  years old, for pity’s sake! Can’t you enjoy what few remaining  childhood years you have left?”</p>
<p>“Quiet,  Oswald,  I’ll do what I please! Clio, get their names and numbers! Oh, and while  you’re at it, ask which hotel they’re staying at,  what seats they’re sitting in, their measurements…”</p>
<p>“One  at a time, sir,” she replied crisply, jotting everything down. She  bowed breezily in front of the girls and clasped her hands together. “Please pardon the young lord: it seems his </p>
<p>biological  urges came earlier than anybody expected. If you would be so kind as  to forgive his vulgar behavior…”</p>
<p>“CLIO,  what the heck are you doing? Don’t slander me like that!”</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry, sir!” she chirped sweetly. “I’ll choose my words more  carefully next time! What I meant to say is that the young master  has a habit of befriending all sorts of women, and you shouldn’t  pay attention to what he says. He is still a child.”</p>
<p>“CLEEEEEEEEEE-YYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOO!!”</p>
<p>“Oh  my, was that a bad expression too?” she giggled. The five women  observing this spectacle decided to back away, slowly, before they  brought any more attention upon themselves, but the fat blue creature  stopped them with an apologetic gesture.</p>
<p>“Please,  please, don’t feel too frightened. This is the direct heir of  Demise Industries, Lord Moriarty Antony Demise Junior, and we are  simply here to participate and promote our products, nothing more!”</p>
<p>“Says  you!” the young boy shouted, stomping hard on his poor servant’s  foot. The creature was so fat that he barely felt it, and jumped  back as the much younger, much smaller man huffed through. “I came  to score with a hot babe, and I see five right here! No offense,  lady, but you’re just way too old for me—although maybe in about  ten years, I could…” Shandra grinned sinisterly and leaned over  until her eyes were level with the kid’s.</p>
<p>“You  are so lucky,” she growled. “If you were any other spoiled  little brat, I’d hang you up by your nose on a coat rack! Try not  to get in my way during the race, okay? Miss Clio, Mr. Oswald, I  leave this farewell for more reasonable minds. Becky honey, if  you’re not going to join me, don’t <em>disappoint</em> me, either. I expect a good race from you, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes  ma’am,” she replied firmly. Lyara smiled in admiration: Rebecca  really looked up to her aunt and loved her. As for their other  rivals…</p>
<p>“Oh,  young master, let it go! She’s only a bounty hunter anyway! Please don’t throw any more tantrums!”</p>
<p>“It’s  not a tantrum! Did you see the bazongas on her? Who cares about age  anymore?! I think I’ve fallen in love! Clio, get her name and  number, and while you’re at it—“</p>
<p>“Her  hotel and measurements, right? I suppose I better head to her  dressing room if I expect to get that last request.”</p>
<p>“For  Pete’s sake, Clio, stop acting so weird! Just her name and number  will do!” Clio giggled softly, briefly turned around to wink at  Rebecca’s group, and resumed her services as Lord Demise Junior’s  secretary. Shana forced herself to laugh.</p>
<p>“I  guess she knows what she’s doing…and he was pretty cute for a  kid.”</p>
<p>“I  liked him,” Mink added.</p>

<p>Director  Astor of the United Cosmic Military bade farewell to Keiko Ozmund as  she dropped her off and was taken to the ship that would represent  her people in the race. While she would only sit on the sidelines as  a spectator and cheerleader, she would entrust one of the military’s  top pilots for the actual race, and choosing a candidate had not been  easy, especially with all the pirate attacks and the mountain of  paperwork forcing them from taking any real action against them. She  put a lot of thought into her decision, and ultimately chose Captain  </p>
<p>Chuunaru  for  the job. Kaori had been stunned, to say the least, especially  since she believed she had failed the military in her last mission. But  Director Astor knew she was a capable Captain and a good pilot;  she just needed the chance to prove herself.</p>
<p>“I  won’t let you down, Director,” Kaori whispered to herself as  final preparations were made. “I swear I’ll prove to you just  how great I am. I’ll make you proud of your decision. Luckily for  me, this job got a whole lot easier once the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> entered the race. I’ll play by the rules until the closing  ceremonies are finished, and then those pirates will get a one-way  ticket to Kaori land!”</p>
<p><em>But  we also got information stating several wanted criminals were aboard  the </em>Dauntless <em>as  well. I want to do the right thing, but I just don’t know which  direction to go in. I should probably attack the pirates first: they’re the biggest threat, after all, and I’ve heard they’ve  been harassing the Ozmund Company. Now that I think about it,  weren’t there a few bounty hunters hanging around? I know I saw  Shandra Hill’s ship in the docks. If anybody can catch the </em>Dauntless<em>,  it’s her!</em></p>
<p>“I  apologize for my earlier outburst,” she announced to her crew. “My  patience just slipped. Our objective is to represent the military in  such a way that it will draw people’s admiration and respect, and  strike horror and amazement into our enemies. Even if we don’t  win, as long as we fly well, we can still emerge victorious. Once  the race is over, pursue the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> at full speed!”</p>
<p>“Roger,  but what about the <em>Dauntless</em>,  ma’am?”</p>
<p>“Pirates  are the concern of the UCM. They are far more dangerous than any  criminal we might come across. Contact Shandra Hill once the race is  over and hire her to capture the other ship. It’s high time we  regain our dignity.”</p>
<p>“Yes,  Captain!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  on the far side of the docks, Derian Kazcada was fretting and  worrying himself bald. He tore out chunks of his hair and ripped his  clothes in terror: this was his one final chance to redeem himself  in Master’s eyes. He didn’t sign on to win the race but to  avenge himself on his enemies. His mission was to destroy the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> for turning back on their contract, and capture the <em>Dauntless</em> and its crew, no matter what the cost. Master vowed that no race  officials would interfere with his work, and he also told Derian that  a few racers would even assist him, just so long as he pulled his own  weight. Derian was concocting a plan and muttering it out loud in  incoherent babbles, even as the hours ticked away and the opening  ceremonies drew closer.</p>
<p>A  loud flourish of trumpets and bold fanfare announced the beginning of  the ceremonies, and all pilots and crews were asked to board their  ships and take place at the starting gate. While this was happening,  the leaders of the Hagan system came forth to give their blessings  and their proud speeches, but the real pomp didn’t begin until the  main sponsors arrived to dedicate the race. Director Astor watched  with beaming pride as two women approached the podium: one in a  wheelchair and the other patiently walking behind her.</p>
<p>“Oh  my god!” Alala squeaked as Rachel turned the broadcast on. “I  know her! That’s the Headmaster of my old school! The  Headmaster’s here! Hey, don’t you guys know who she is? That’s  the Headmaster of Ares Academy! And that other person—she’s the  Chairwoman of the Stellkei Educational Division of Academics! I had  no idea <em>they</em> were sponsoring the race!” Several women shushed her and turned  the volume up. The woman in the wheelchair, Alala’s former  Headmaster, was speaking first. She was a woman in her mid-fifties,  and her reddish hair was darkening and turning gray, but she still  carried herself with great discipline and beauty, and </p>
<p>her  eyes shimmered with a striking light. The woman standing behind her  was about the same age, only her hair was almost completely black,  with very few silver strands to boast about, and her skin was toasted  bronze from having a Mediterranean heritage.</p>
<p>“Ladies  and gentlemen, spectators and sportspeople, old and young, wealthy  and meager, great and small, citizens and species from every corner  of our galaxy, I bid you all welcome to the one hundred eighth  Galactic Space Race, hosted by the Hagan system and sponsored by the  Stellkei Educational Division of Academics. My wife and I are here  to promote goodwill, knowledge, understanding, and the realization of  dreams, for it is within unity, even in the fire of competition, that  we truly become better people. May you race with all of your heart,  and may every one of you find your prize, no matter which position  you finish in. Fly safe, fly free, fly proudly, every one.” The  spectators applauded solemnly; more than a few of them had been  moved. Alala sighed lovingly.</p>
<p>“She  hasn’t changed…but I had no idea she and the Chairwoman were  married!”</p>
<p>“My  wife and I will now introduce the pilots and their vessels as they  take one unified lap around the mining colony,” the Chairwoman  stated. “Pilots, begin your circle at cruising speed, and please  keep in formation.” The Chairwoman began introductions and  alternated with her wife the Headmaster, just as the ships revolved  around the mining colony, oozing charm and confidence for the  trillions of viewers.</p>
<p>“Our  first vessel in the lineup is last year’s champion, the heart of  the Sindar Empire, the one and only <em>Einlanzer  3</em>,  piloted by Arileth Naiis!!”</p>
<p>“Next  in line is <em>Elegant  Clio</em>,  the ship representing Demise Industries. Although the current head  of Demise Industries could not attend, his nephew Moriarty Demise,  Jr. has kindly volunteered to act in liaison, and his bodyguards  Oswald Nykhentfohr and Clio Petra, presumably whom the ship was named  after, will act as pilots.”</p>
<p>“Now  we come to a familiar face, the Norgrim’s crown jewel, regarded as  the fastest ship in their expansive merchant fleet! Five-time  champion Hetz Loma pilots the legendary <em>Opportune  Rain</em>!”</p>
<p>“After  that, burning through the skies like a brilliant comet is the Ozmund  Company’s famous <em>Zephyr</em>,  flying on her final voyage! Let’s give this incredible ship and  her daring pilot all the support we can! Long live the <em>Zephyr</em>! Long live Tinma Niklaus!”</p>
<p>“Following  is an independent ship sponsored by an anonymous donor! Captained by  the legendary Dr. Miracle and piloted by Kayleigh and Teleah Acheron,  it is the <em>Dauntless</em>!”</p>
<p>“Next  up is one of the most infamous pirate vessels around, commanded by  the beautiful yet bloodthirsty Dead Roses! You know her, you love  her, it’s the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>!”</p>
<p>“Coming  up is another favorite of the Space Races, the Rennai penal colony  vessel <em>Screaming  Skull</em>—as  always, piloted by indentured criminals working hard for their  freedom! Good luck, everyone!”</p>
<p>“Speaking  of renegades, this next ship is piloted by one of the most feared and  powerful gangs on Avatar! Captained and piloted by their current  leader, Asara Sandhya,  it’s—what else—the <em>Night  Hammer</em>!”</p>
<p>“Another  independent ship recently entering the race is the <em>Backdraft</em>,  piloted by someone known only as ‘Mr. D.’ Mr. D was sponsored by  Nemo Nephele, a recent newcomer to the business world. We want to  wish him the best of luck from here on out!”</p>
<p>“Now  we come to another famous ship, representing the United Cosmic  Military! The current Director is a former student of mine, so I’ll  be watching their progress quite closely. Hailing from Helios 3,  Kaori Chuunaru is piloting <em>Stormrider</em>!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Next  we have a huge fan favorite, the envoy from Tigris! As always, they  have chosen a slick, sexy ship with a very suggestive name! Ready to  steal our hearts is the lovely Fai-Lynn, piloting the energetic <em>Colonel  Lingus</em>!”</p>
<p>“But  let’s not forget another former champion ready to steal the crown  away! Hailing from the Heavyworld planet of Brigadoon is the <em>Bulldozer</em>,  piloted by Mack Sodenberg!”</p>
<p>“Next  is another heartbreaker looking to make it big again this year! One  of the finest and most feared bounty hunters in the galaxy is back: Shandra Hill is here, and she is piloting the classic <em>Prince  Mishkin</em>! I hope our more disreputable participants are prepared to run from  her once the race is over!”</p>
<p>“But  let’s not forget the mighty vessel representing the indomitable  Elshyrin species, either! I’ve been told this race is very  personal for the pilot, so please cheer for Saki Yrhol and the <em>Domination</em>!”</p>
<p>“Next,  we have another newcomer to the fold, apparently one with a classy  sense of humor! Steering the infamous <em>Der  Fliegende Hollander</em> is Captain Barbarossa! Let us hope the real thing doesn’t show up  to ruin our fun.”</p>
<p>“Finally,  the jewel of the Helios system, the joy of Gaia and the  self-proclaimed ‘hope for tomorrow’, piloting the <em>Kemosabe</em> is newcomer Satine Yeriman!”</p>
<p>“We  wish you all good luck, a safe flight, and a wonderful race.”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>The  crowd became dead silent. Millions of people becoming so still sent  shivers up the spine, and the air grew thick with joyous  anticipation. Chairwoman Stellkei stood by her wife’s side,  raising a white handkerchief in the air, a symbol of the fluttering  pure hearts gathered there and the heightened suspense they helped  create. Engines were revved up and pilots nervously hovered over the  accelerators. Sweat poured over skin. Palms became slick. Mouths  turned dry. Pulses soared. Hands were held. Time itself seemed to  freeze for but a moment.</p>
<p>All  Hell suddenly broke loose as Ivy dropped the handkerchief, and the  race began.</p>
