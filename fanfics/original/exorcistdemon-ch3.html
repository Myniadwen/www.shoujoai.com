<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>      Only hours before, Eveon was walking Mina back to her house. They were walking next to 
each other and Eveon kept looking behind her to see if the exorcist had caught up. &quot;Well, I 
hope he&#39;s okay... Let&#39;s go to your house and wait for him, okay?&quot; Mina simply nodded and 
Eveon caught a strange glint in her deep blue eyes. She thought nothing of it because Mina 
seemed ecstatic to be rescued by her. As if on cue, she took the blonde&#39;s hand into her own, 
making Eveon blush a vibrant color.

      &quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Mina said sweetly, a small blush gracing her cheeks. To Eveon, 
Mina was the epitome of cuteness. Why hadn&#39;t some boy swept her off her feet already? &quot;I had 
to come! I just left you in the woods by yourself like a crappy friend, so-&quot;

      Eveon was cut off as Mina suddenly embraced her. She blushed as she felt her friend&#39;s 
breath against her ear. &quot;You did nothing wrong... it means so much to me that you came.&quot; 
Mina hugging her randomly was not something new to Eveon, but that didn&#39;t mean it wasn&#39;t 
awkward. She always smelt like peaches and her unruly black hair tickled her nose. She tried 
to move out of the embrace, but Mina&#39;s hold was relentless. Instead, Eveon took a deep 
breath and hugged her back. Mina finally let go and laughed at Eveon&#39;s red face.

      As they continued back to Mina&#39;s house hand in hand, Eveon never thought to question 
her friend&#39;s intimate mood...

      Until they were alone later that night. 

      Eveon wasn&#39;t sure if Mina&#39;s parents knew or didn&#39;t care, but the 14 year old always 
climbed up the tree next to Mina&#39;s bedroom to visit her. After the exorcist had checked to 
make sure Mina was okay, her best friend said she wanted to meet her that night. The tree 
had a ladder on it (Eveon was positive that the Lamets knew she was sneaking in) and the 
blonde made it to her friend&#39;s room in no time.

      She knocked quietly on the window before sliding it up. Eveon didn&#39;t want to be 
mistaken as a pervert or something... When she entered, she noticed that Mina was sitting on 
her bed, wearing a night gown instead of pajamas. That was weird... Eveon didn&#39;t even know 
that she owned a night gown. &quot;Aren&#39;t you cold in that?&quot; Mina looked up before giving her a 
sheepish smile. &quot;What? You don&#39;t like it?&quot;

      Eveon sat next to her friend. &quot;I guess that blue is a nice shade...&quot; Mina just giggled 
at her. The blonde felt out of place wearing sweats and a t-shirt, but what happened next 
made her forget. &quot;I have a surprise for you...&quot; Mina murmured and picked up a plate from the 
nightstand. On it was the most delicious chocolate cake Eveon had seen. &quot;I know this is your 
favorite!&quot; Eveon nodded with her eyes trained on the cake. Mina had to stifle a laugh before 
picking up a piece with her fork. Eveon reached for the fork, but Mina only shooed her hand 
away. Instead, she delicately placed the piece into her friend&#39;s mouth. Eveon greedily 
gobbled down.

      Mina continued to feed her that way (she didn&#39;t even let Eveon touch the glass of milk 
when she drank) until the slice was all gone. Eveon blushed as Mina wiped some of the 
frosting off of her mouth with a napkin. Mina&#39;s bright blue eyes seemed so content and happy 
and maternal... &quot;You&#39;re going to be a great mother, Mina.&quot;

      Those blue eyes suddenly flickered to her purple ones. &quot;...You think so...?&quot; Eveon 
nodded as Mina set the plate down on her nightstand. Suddenly, Eveon felt really guilty. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry; I should have left some cake for you!&quot; Mina just shook her head and laughed.

      &quot;No, no... I already had some. I know how much you love my baking...&quot; Mina let one 
hand caress Eveon&#39;s cheek. &quot;I would be content to bake all the time... just to make you 
happy.&quot; She scooted closer to her and her hand continued its caresses. &quot;...Mi...na...?&quot; 
Eveon murmured, unsure as to what was happening.

      &quot;I would... I would cook lots of things just for you. Cake, sandwiches, cookies... 
anything for you. Your mother finally taught me how to make that pot roast you enjoy so 
much, so I could make that too.&quot; Mina smiled and brought herself closer so she was only a 
few inches away from Eveon. Eveon could feel Mina&#39;s breath. It smelt like chocolate. 
&quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s... really cool,&quot; she said awkwardly. Mina&#39;s free hand grabbed her own.

      &quot;You don&#39;t have to cook for me... I-I mean, you should save that for someone important 
like... like... a boyfriend or something,&quot; Eveon said, sheepishly. Mina&#39;s expression turned 
to something of sadness. &quot;...I...I...I would make you all those things because it makes you 
smile... and that&#39;s the most beautiful thing there is,&quot; she murmured softly. &quot;...You&#39;re 
important... you&#39;re the most important person to me so I would do anything to see you 
smile.&quot;

      Eveon just looked at her in disbelief. Mina was acting so weird...! Suddenly, the 
blonde girl smiled. &quot;You don&#39;t have to do any of those things, Mina. You don&#39;t have to do 
anything... Just being with you makes me smile.&quot; Mina&#39;s eyes brightened and she leaned 
forward.

      Eveon&#39;s eyes widened considerably as her best friend kissed her. Mina&#39;s warm lips were 
on her own in a chaste kiss. The blonde girl couldn&#39;t believe it. She started to struggle, 
but Mina&#39;s hand had moved from her cheek to nestle in her hair and her other arm was 
securely latched around her waist. Eveon was finally able to jump out of her friend&#39;s arms 
when Mina&#39;s lips started moving and her tongue flicked across her own lips.

      Eveon landed on the ground on her butt, breathing heavily. Mina just gave her a 
startled look. There was no way that just happened... at least Eveon wanted to believe that. 
&quot;Uh... I... I... we... must have slipped... that was an accident, right...?&quot; Mina got off of 
the bed to kneel next to her.

      &quot;It wasn&#39;t an accident.&quot; When Mina murmured those words everything hit her like a 
truck. &quot;I&#39;m tired of hiding it... I... I love you,&quot; she said and reached out to grab one of 
Eveon&#39;s hands. The blonde girl finally realized why Mina had been acting so peculiar.

      Was that why Mina had gotten so mad when a boy asked her out? And the nightgown... 
Eveon looked at her friend and realized how revealing it was... and that shade of blue was 
her favorite color. Mina knew it was her favorite color, just like how she knew Eveon loved 
her chocolate cake.

      She wrenched her hand from Mina and dashed to the window. As she yanked it up, she 
felt Mina&#39;s arms snake around her waist. &quot;Eveon! Please, wait!&quot; She was scared out of her 
mind and she pushed her friend&#39;s arms away. She jumped onto the tree branch and hastily 
escaped down the trunk before running. Eveon could hear Mina calling out to her, but she 
kept running.

      The tears streamed down her face as she finally slowed down near the bed and 
breakfast. This whole time, Mina... Eveon shivered. Her best friend had... Mina was always a 
planner and she never did like spur of the moment things. In her mind&#39;s eye, Eveon could see 
Mina meticulously baking the cake... adding the right amount of cocoa powder before melting 
the chocolate to use in the frosting. She could see Mina perfectly cutting that slice around 
10 minutes before her arrival and setting it down on the nightstand. She could see Mina 
choosing that blue nightgown, hoping it would be to her tastes. She could see Mina sitting 
on her bed, taking deep breaths, waiting for her to come.

      She kept crying. 

***** 

      Krystal sat on the bed, trying to console the confused girl. &quot;Th-that... that&#39;s stuff 
she should be doing for a b-b-boyfriend, not me!&quot; Krystal just handed her some tissues 
before speaking. &quot;This is something you can&#39;t run from. You have to think about your 
feelings for her-&quot; She was interrupted by Eveon.

      &quot;She&#39;s my friend! I... don&#39;t understand! If it&#39;s not the demon then why... why is she 
in... in love...?&quot; The exorcist continued to wipe away her tears. &quot;Just think about how you 
feel and then talk to her.&quot; Eveon gave her a worried look. &quot;I mean, try talking to her in a 
somewhat public place. Sneak into her room again and who knows?&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s attempt at a joke failed as Eveon blanched at the thought. An hour later, 
the young girl had calmed down and said goodbye. It was time for Krystal, the exorcist, to 
go home. 

***** 

      Krystal let out a moan as she plopped down on her couch. She lived in a nice, big 
apartment with two bedrooms, but all she wanted to do was sleep on the couch. That had been, 
by far, the weirdest job she had ever gotten as an exorcist. Lesbian demons influencing 
young kids... goodness! In the back of her mind, Krystal wondered if Isaka had even 
enchanted Mina.

      She remembered the picture Eveon showed her and something told her that Mina had 
always been in love. Maybe Isaka had convinced her to express her feeling to her friend? 
Krystal shrugged to herself as she started to unbutton her shirt.

      Unbeknownst to our heroine, she was being watched. Isaka had the ability to manipulate 
shadows and see what the shadows saw. Right now, she was outside of the exorcist&#39;s 
apartment, but she used her ability to slink inside and hide in the shadows against her 
wall. She smiled to herself, because she would finally get to see the exorcist&#39;s identity... 
then she would make his life hell for beating her.

      Krystal continued to strip down and let her pants fall to the floor along with her 
shirt. When she removed the scarf and turban, she didn&#39;t hear the surprised gasp from the 
demon within her home. Isaka eyed her in disbelief. Krystal was now only clad in a camisole 
and boxer shorts, but Isaka&#39;s eyes were primarily focused on her blonde hair and beautiful 
face. The exorcist was a girl? A girl?!

      Isaka smiled happily to herself. This meant... The demon stifled her giggling. For so 
long she had been searching for a woman who would be her eternal mate. For some odd reason, 
Isaka had the feeling that she wanted Krystal to be that woman. Her thoughts were cut off as 
Krystal removed the camisole and unwrapped the bandages around her chest. The blonde entered 
the bathroom, but not before Isaka caught a glimpse of her breasts as they escaped from 
their bondage.

      The demon had to quickly wipe the drool off of her mouth. 

***** 

      Krystal was blissfully unaware that a demon had followed her back home. Instead, she 
set about her normal day (the kind that didn&#39;t involve vanquishing evil) and only thought a 
little bit about Eveon. She hoped the young girl was doing fine after Mina&#39;s confession... 
Krystal herself didn&#39;t believe in homosexual relationships, but there were some times...

      Well, there were exceptions. She dressed herself in casual attire that morning before 
setting off to her job. Isaka followed her quietly to a pre-school and the demon was 
astonished. Krystal entered the building and was greeted by one of the teachers. Isaka found 
it touching (not like she would admit it) to see Krystal dedicate her free time to helping 
out young children. All of the kids seemed to flock to the blonde and Isaka secretly wished 
that she was one of those kids being embraced by the college student. Lucky rascals.

      Isaka was still trying to formulate her grand plan of revenge, but... She trailed 
Krystal back to her apartment and watched from the shadows as Krystal curled up on the couch 
with her laptop. As the 19 year old concentrated on her online homework, Isaka concentrated 
on her smooth legs revealed by her shorts.

      That was it. Isaka had to have her. All this teasing was driving her insane! Her 
perverted demon mind was distracted when Krystal checked the time and went to her bedroom. 
Isaka almost followed her, but she didn&#39;t want to jump the girl! ...Well, not yet. She 
lingered in the shadows, wondering what the blonde girl was up to. When Krystal finally 
emerged from her bedroom, she was dressed up in a skirt and a pretty shirt.

      As she checked her hair in the mirror, Isaka was trying not to stare too intently. 
Trying was the keyword. Unfortunately, Isaka&#39;s fantasies were interrupted by a knock on the 
apartment door. With a smile on her face, Krystal opened it and greeted the person on the 
other side.

      &quot;Seth! You&#39;re finally here,&quot; said Krystal and Isaka saw a mildly attractive young man 
on the other side of the door. Isaka had never wanted to kill someone so badly before.
