<h1>Bloody Guardian (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/bloodguard-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>The sun gradually fell beneath the horizon, twilight
racing across the land as the day fled the coming of
the night. In the shadows for the forest the pile of
leaves and dirt shifted, rose upward, then gracefully
the tall figure climbed out of her rough concealment.

&quot;Such a nuisance,&quot; the black haired woman growled in
annoyance as she tried to brush her garb off, her
simple leathers soiled with the earth she had laid in.
Heather McKennit took a breath more out of reflex than
need, reaching up to tidy her mane of long hair.
Plucking out a twig she muttered, &quot;I need a bath.&quot;

Heather had been oddly disappointed to discover that
the legends of the vampires she had learned from her
nanny were largely untrue, at least as far as she
could discover. A stake through the heart was
inconvenient but not lethal, as was the cross. Garlic
tasted disgusting but little other harm was done. And
finally the sun did not burn, though a great
sleepiness overcame her in daylight, a weakness as
severe as any fire. So during the day she slept
hidden, digging in the dirt while traveling to shield
herself from any curious fools.

Leaving the woods Heather was relieved to see no
horses on the road, no wagons or travelers walking
from place to place. The hunger had been growing in
her the past few days, and she had no wish to feast on
the innocent or unwary. With her vision the night was
lit up like day, and her nose brought the scents of
the world to her... good and bad.

It was nearly a hour before she came over a rise, the
broken wagon coming into view beside the road.
Heather&#39;s eyes narrowed as she swept it with her eyes,
the broken axle and the loose guide lines showing the
horses had fled. &#39;So where are the people?&#39; she
wondered.

&quot;Oh thank god!&quot; the woman cried as she emerged from
the woods, her golden hair hanging limply over her
shoulders. &quot;Traveler,&quot; she looked Heather over, &quot;could
you escort me to the next town? I fear my companions
have abandoned me.&quot;

Heather&#39;s nose twitched as a familiar scent carried on
the wind, then she smiled. &quot;Of course,&quot; she nodded, &quot;I
couldn&#39;t leave a woman alone here.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she smiled up at Heather, &quot;my name is
Elizabeth.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d best get going,&quot; Heather said briskly, turning
her back on the woman and starting off down the road.

The knife was drawn with a steely hiss and Elizabeth
lunged, but Heather was ready. Swiftly she dodged,
pulling the girl&#39;s arm and forcing the blade free,
sending it clattering to the dirt. &quot;How did...?&quot;
Elizabeth gasped as Heather grabbed her by the arms,
restraining her.

&quot;Let her go,&quot; the man yelled as he burst from cover,
his two comrades following from where Heather had
spotted them earlier, waving their swords
threateningly.

None too gently Heather cast the girl aside, the
pretty bait these bandits had used to lure the unwary
to death. &quot;Of course,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;I have you to
play with now.&quot;

That surprised them all, giving Heather a free moment
to strike. The one bandit gasped as she grabbed him by
the head and twisted with inhuman strength, the wet
noise of a neck breaking loud in the near silence.
Tossing him away she dodged a sword strike as if he
was standing still, tearing the weapon away then
skewering him with his own weapon.

The third bandit tossed his weapon away in terror,
pissing himself in fear as he whimpered, &quot;Please, I
never meant.... never wanted... they made me join
them!&quot;

&quot;And how many of your victims plead for their lives?&quot;
Heather asked coldly, punching him and feeling his
face break beneath the force of her blow, killing him
in moments.

Elizabeth was murmuring prayers under her breath,
backing away in pure shock from the massacre that had
only taken a few seconds to happen. As Heather turned
back to her she tried to bolt, but the vampire caught
her easily.

&quot;Please mistress,&quot; Elizabeth blurted out as she looked
up into that pale face, those intense eyes, &quot;I&#39;ll
serve you, just spare me!&quot;

&quot;And is that what you told the bandits when you agreed
to be their Judas goat?&quot; Heather answered huskily,
feeling distracted by the scent coming off her. It was
sweeter than the men, like a fine wine, and drew her
close to the beautiful girl.

Elizabeth stopped struggling, seemingly fascinated by
Heather&#39;s gaze, &quot;Mistress....&quot;

Heather&#39;s tongue rasped across her skin to taste that
sweetness, hunger spiraling up within her. There was a
sharp burst of pain in her gums as her fangs extended
involuntarily, fever taking her mind then she bit
savagely, blood pulsing into her mouth.

&quot;Ah!&quot; Elizabeth convulsed, legs involuntarily
tightening around Heather&#39;s body as passion raced
through her wildly.

Drinking the blood of men had been far better than any
food Heather had ever ate, and this was similarly
better than those first feedings. Elizabeth&#39;s blood
was like ambrosia, filling a hunger that Heather
hadn&#39;t known she possessed, a need that sang in her
veins as her hands stroked the girl to higher peaks of
passion. Finally their mutual pleasure faded as the
girl&#39;s blood ran dry and reluctantly Heather let the
empty body fall to the ground.

Reaching up to touch her bloody lips Heather murmured,
&quot;Not that I&#39;ve tasted that... can I ever go back
again?&quot;



&quot;Hey Heather,&quot; the bartender nodded in greeting as he
produced her regular bottle of wine, pouring her a
glass then setting the bottle on the bar beside her.

&quot;Thanks Carter,&quot; Heather took the glass, swirling the
wine around it a moment. She sniffed once, savoring
the scent then drank. Wine didn&#39;t satisfy the hunger,
didn&#39;t even make a dent, but it still tasted good to
her. &quot;Good year,&quot; she added as she set it down. She
looked good in battered jeans and a leather jacket,
athletic and a little wild.

&quot;Glad to hear it,&quot; Carter said with a smile, &quot;since
everything I&#39;ve learned about wine I picked up from
you.&quot; The older man wiped at a tall glass and casually
said, &quot;That little girl you rescued has been asking
about you.&quot;

Heather raised an eyebrow, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Seems you made quite an impression on her,&quot; Carter
said calmly. He flashed her a smile, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I
haven&#39;t told her much.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s not much to tell,&quot; Heather answered as her
thoughts raced, wondering what the child might have
heard.... or deduced. Her natural caution had grown
over the centuries along with her power, a wariness
that had helped keep her alive.

&quot;This girl a problem?&quot; Carter asked sharply, brown
eyes narrowing.

&quot;Not in the way you mean,&quot; Heather said reassuringly,
smiling slightly at his misplaced protectiveness.

&quot;Anyway, she&#39;s been coming around a lot lately,&quot;
Carter said gruffly, &quot;you can probably find her here
somewhere.&quot;

Heather poured herself another glass of wine,
finishing it off in a single gulp then rising as the
music pulsed and throbbed through the nightclub like a
massive heartbeat. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll do that,&quot; she said,
striding off into the dimly lit club.

The dancers ground their bodies together wildly out on
the floor, yet also unconsciously parting for the tall
huntress that strode in their midst. The scents that
filled the air were enough to make Heather&#39;s teeth
ache to be used, sweet excitement and heated passion
lingering on the artificially circulated air. A few
brave figures dared to touch her skin or gaze at
Heather longingly but she dismissed them, focused on
one prey.

Alice watched the dancers, the redhead standing
slightly apart from the passionately moving people.
The petite young woman was wearing a green blouse and
blue jeans, her only jewelry a simple necklace that
gleamed in the gloom. She looked up, somehow sensing
Heather&#39;s approach and smiled at her shyly, &quot;Hello.&quot;

Heather met her gaze and was relieved to see that her
eyes were clear, unclouded by the influence of her
power. Her mind and will were powerful, so much so
that she could influence a weaker mind without even
intending to. &quot;We meet again,&quot; Heather answered, &quot;I
understand you&#39;ve been asking about me?&quot;

Alice blushed charmingly, looking away from the tall
woman. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;I was curious about
you.&quot;

Heather could see the heat that was radiating off
Alice, picking up the subtle scents of both excitement
and fear coming off her. &#39;She may not know what I am,&#39;
she mused, &#39;but she clearly knows I&#39;m dangerous.&#39;
Aloud she asked, &quot;Why is that?&quot;

Alice smiled slightly as she confessed, &quot;I can&#39;t seem
to get you out of my mind, wondering why you helped me
against Sam, when everyone else was just ignoring what
he was going to do....&quot;

&quot;I had my reasons,&quot; Heather answered firmly, &quot;and
they&#39;re not anywhere near as noble as you seem to
think.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you,&quot; Alice answered promptly.

&quot;You should,&quot; Heather answered, letting a tiny bit of
her true nature come forth.

Alice paled slightly, swaying as she gazed at Heather
with wide eyes, looked up in awe at the predator
Heather really was. &quot;You&#39;re...&quot; she gulped,
&quot;beautiful.&quot;

Heather blinked in surprise, &#39;That wasn&#39;t the reaction
I was expecting.&#39; Taking the girl by the arm she
gently drew her away from the dancers and towards the
back of the club, then out into the alley behind the
building.

&quot;What...?&quot; Alice started.

Heather cut her off with a kiss, a fierce pressing of
her lips to the girl&#39;s. With a moan Alice surrendered,
swooning in Heather&#39;s arms as they kissed
passionately, tongues dueling. She kissed her cheek,
licked down her neck, then... bit.

Alice moaned as she writhed in Heather&#39;s arms,
squirming as the most exquisite pleasure raced through
her veins, a pleasure equaled in Heather&#39;s body. They
remained wielded together for long moments before
Heather pulled back, drawing on all her will to
release the lovely young girl before her life was
taken.

Heather shuddered as the last tremors of ecstasy raced
through her body, delicately bandaging the child&#39;s
neck. &quot;Forget about me,&quot; she commanded the entranced
girl forcefully, &quot;forget ever meeting me. Go home, and
go on with your life.&quot;

With a trace of regret Heather watched Alice walk
home, following her in the shadows. &#39;I&#39;ve had mortal
lovers before,&#39; she thought, &#39;it always ends in
sorrow. Better that she be let go now, than be slain
or flee from me later.&#39;</pre>
