        The front window of the bar exploded outward, the man hitting 
the ground and bouncing with the force of the blow. The bar was dimly 
lit, the patrons gazing in shock at the two women who stood confidently 
in the middle of the wreckage.

        &quot;Some of you might remember my last visit,&quot; Sam said pleasantly, 
the brown haired priest looking around her casually.

        &quot;Kill the bitch,&quot; a man leapt forward with a knife, clearly not 
having been there during Sam&#39;s last visit to the little dive.

        The gun was drawn before he could even blink, the muzzle pointed 
directly between his eyes. As he started to sweat Sam smiled at him 
coldly, &quot;You&#39;re mostly human and don&#39;t stink of sin.&quot; A little pause, 
&quot;That&#39;s the only reason I&#39;m not killing you right now.&quot;

        &quot;Which means,&quot; Descent said with a grin as the glossy black 
haired woman grabbed him and picked him right off the floor, &quot;you&#39;re 
mine.&quot; He followed the first fool out the window with a satisfying thump 
as she turned to the crowd to smile toothily, &quot;Who&#39;s next?&quot;

        &quot;What do you want?&quot; one man asked tentatively from the back.

        Sam slipped her gun away noiselessly, the scent of incense and 
gunpowder on the air. &quot;Someone defiled a temple,&quot; she said coldly, &quot;and 
then murdered a nun there. I want a name.&quot;

        Decent loudly cracked her knuckles as she let loose her usual 
restraints, her demonic side fully manifesting in a wave of dark power 
that swept across the whole bar. Her eyes glowed a sullen red, her long 
hair sweeping backwards as if by some invisible wind. She was menace 
personified, exactly as she and Sam had planned.

        &quot;Shit,&quot; a man whispered.

        &quot;A name,&quot; Sam repeated, reaching to pull something out from her 
coat.

        &quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; an anguished voice cried.

        The two women studied the crowd silently for a long moment, then 
on some invisible signal turned away. &quot;Spread the word,&quot; Descent said 
dangerously, &quot;let all your little friends know. We want the name and 
we&#39;ll be making your lives hell until we get it.&quot;

        There was a moment of dead silence in the bar until they were 
sure they were gone. &quot;What the hell were they?&quot; one of the men at the 
bar finally breathed out, the stain on his pants clearly showing he had 
pissed himself sometime during all the excitement.

        &quot;A crazy priest and a demoness,&quot; the bartender scowled. He got 
on the phone and dialed, waiting impatiently until it was answered 
before he demanded, &quot;I&#39;m paying you people for protection, damn it! 
Where were you?&quot;

        &quot;What happened?&quot; the woman&#39;s voice responded quietly.

        &quot;A demoness and a friggin&#39; crazy priest is what happened,&quot; he 
howled, &quot;coming in here, busting up my bar and threatening my 
customers!&quot;

        The voice was a purr, &quot;What did they want?&quot;

        &quot;To know who hit that temple and killed the nun,&quot; he scowled.

        A moment&#39;s silence then, &quot;We&#39;ll handle the repairs to the bar in 
the usual fashion, and you have my assurances we&#39;ll deal with this 
little problem.&quot;

        Sitting in her high-rise office Lina put the phone down with a 
click, the icy blonde in a fine suit frowning slightly. She picked it up 
again a few moment later and hit the speed dial, waiting before it was 
picked up to ask, &quot;Grace?&quot;

        The controlled voice answered simply, &quot;Yes?&quot;

        &quot;I think we can confirm that Descent and the Priest are working 
together,&quot; Lina reported to her quietly, &quot;they&#39;re busting up bars 
downtown looking for Selene.&quot;

        &quot;Well isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Grace murmured. There was a 
moment&#39;s pause, &quot;Inform your people on the street to steer clear of them 
for now.&quot;

        &quot;Why?&quot; Lina raised elegant eyebrows in surprise.

        &quot;Are you questioning me?&quot; there was no change in Grace&#39;s tone of 
voice but Lina suddenly felt a chill run down her spine.

        &quot;No, mistress,&quot; Lina blurted submissively.

        Grace actually laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;m not your mistress, girl.&quot; 
More seriously she explained, &quot;Certain private contractors are coming in 
to deal with our little problem, and I&#39;d rather not have our people get 
in the way.&quot;

        &quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; Lina answered. Grace hung up the phone a 
moment later and Lina sighed softly, a bit surprised by the pulse of 
excitement she had got from being threatened by Grace. &#39;Too bad she 
belongs to Diana,&#39; she thought, &#39;body and soul.&#39;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; one of her lieutenants stuck his head into the office, 
his black suit crisp and neat. All her people dressed well, they knew 
the consequences of not taking care of their appearance. His blonde hair 
framed a beautiful face, blue eyes gazing at her intently.

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Lina asked, the pulse of her blood drumming in her ears.

        &quot;The shipment is ready to move out,&quot; he said.

        Lina rose smoothly, &quot;Let&#39;s see.&quot; They went down to the shipping 
dock, Lina studying the boy thoughtfully, &#39;Such a pretty face.&#39;

        A crate was carefully opened for her and he reached in to the 
tank within, fishing out a slightly wriggling object. It looked a bit 
like a thin worm, tiny tentacles waving out from one end. &quot;The parasites 
are a hot street commodity,&quot; he explained needlessly, &quot;in exchange for 
just a bit of blood and tissue they continuously trigger the brain&#39;s 
pleasure center.&quot;

        &quot;How long does the user last before they die?&quot; Lina asked 
curiously.

        &quot;A week or so,&quot; he answered, &quot;it varies from user to user. They 
become remarkably compliant, too, so blissed out they don&#39;t care.&quot;

        &quot;May I?&quot; Lina took it from his hand, studying the little 
creature thoughtfully, watching it wriggle a bit on her palm. &quot;Have they 
been tested? We&#39;ve had bad shipments comer in before from the lower 
realms,&quot; she asked.

        &quot;No, ma&#39;am,&quot; the slim blonde conceded.

        &quot;An error that&#39;s easily rectified,&quot; Lina said casually.

        With astonishing speed Lina reached out to grasp him by those 
silky locks and yanked him off balance, bringing the creature right up 
to his face. The symboite knew exactly where it needed to go, wiggling 
up his face into the nose with remarkable speed.

        &quot;No!&quot; he wept, frantically clawing at his face as the bulge 
swiftly slipped up his nose then disappearing into his nasal cavity. 
&quot;Grlick,&quot; an incoherent noise as he felt is slipping across the surface 
of his brain seeking it&#39;s target then he stiffened.

        Lina watched with interest as he went stiff, those blue eyes 
going almost comically round. He shuddered, moaning as a substantial 
bulge formed at his groin, dropping to his knees as his legs gave out. 
His expression was pure bliss as he gazed mindlessly into the distance.

        &quot;Looks like it&#39;s a good batch,&quot; Lina said calmly. She looked up 
to meet her other employees&#39; eyes, men and woman gazing back calmly. 
&quot;Bette, you&#39;re second in command,&quot; she nodded to the little brunette, 
&quot;get the shipment out.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Bette nodded crisply. She looked down at the blankly 
gazing boy and asked, &quot;What do you want us to do with...?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll handle it,&quot; Lina dropped her voice to a purr, &quot;go.&quot;

        The men and women were out of the room in only moments, the 
crates loaded up on the truck and moving out. There was a soft sound 
behind her and Lina turned, seeing the boy gazing up at her adoringly. 
&quot;Wahhyy?&quot; he managed to get out.

        Lina casually reached out with her dress shoe to drive her heel 
into his groin, bringing forth a moan of pleasure as the parasite 
converted his pain to pleasure. &quot;It was nothing personal,&quot; she explained 
as she dug her heel in, &quot;I just had to make an example of someone.&quot;

        There was a shudder and a spreading wetness soon covered his 
crotch. Despite the orgasm he remained rock hard, the bulge actually 
growing larger. Lina reached down to tug at his tie and he stumbled to 
his feet like a puppy, looking at her eagerly.

        &quot;You know I think we&#39;re going to have a lot of fun,&quot; Lina said 
as she used the tie to lead him from the room, &quot;at least until your 
brain gives out.&quot;</pre>
