<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>      Erin lied in the room, awake. After fainting, they had moved her to one of the nearby 
rooms so she could rest. Her mind was a mess. How was she supposed to deal with all this? 
She was a normal girl, had a few bad experience with snakes, but she was still normal! She 
was going off to college and all she wanted was...

      Something normal. Something happy. She now regretted walking down that path near the 
forest. She&#39;d done it for old time&#39;s sake and she heard a-

      As if on cue, Erin heard the same exact jingle she&#39;d been thinking of. &quot;Wha...?&quot; She 
lied there, silent. And once again, she heard the bell. Was there a bell in the bed? For 
some odd reason, that bell made her think of happy things. She couldn&#39;t remember where she 
had heard it before today, but...

      Erin sat up and started to fish around under the sheets. Where was it...? She giggled 
like a child on Christmas morning when her hand found the object she&#39;d been seeking. With a 
smile, she pulled her hand out of the sheets and raised it to her face to examine what she 
found.

      To Erin&#39;s chagrin, what lied in the palm of her hand was not only a bell, but the tiny 
snake that the bell belonged to.

      Everyone in the house was quite sure they lost their hearing as Erin let out a shrill 
scream.

      Isaka and Krystal had just finished showering (the demon was planning to make a move 
on the lovely blonde) when they heard the scream. Tripping each other none too gracefully 
(not like they minded the body contact) they got there just in time to slam the door open 
and see a cringing Erin sitting on the bed.

      &quot;It-it-it-it-it-it&#39;s on m-m-m-m-me!&quot; She stuttered out and that&#39;s when Krystal saw it. 
There was a tiny snake lounging on Erin&#39;s shoulder and affectionately rubbing its head 
against her. Krystal walked over and picked the snake up off of Erin.

      &quot;Wait a second,&quot; Isaka murmured and pointed at the snake. &quot;Isn&#39;t this the same snake 
we found in the temple?&quot; As if on cue, the snake opened its jaws and bit down on Isaka&#39;s 
finger. The bell let out a slight jingle and Isaka just smirked. The snake still didn&#39;t have 
any teeth.

      Erin, on the other hand, was frantically brushing her shoulder off and giving Isaka a 
disbelieving look. &quot;H-how can you hold it?!&quot;

      The two lovers exchanged looks. Isaka let the snake dangle from her finger and started 
to walk out. &quot;Um, we&#39;ll take care of the snake, Erin,&quot; Krystal said, giving her a reassuring 
pat on the back. &quot;Should anything happen, just scream or come get us, okay? We&#39;re right next 
door.&quot;

      With that, Krystal left and Erin curled up in a ball on the bed. Her thoughts lingered 
on the thought of a being a goddess or at least a vessel. What did it mean? What it really 
mean...? She slowly drifted off to sleep, her dreams muddled. 

***** 

      Erin wasn&#39;t quite sure what was happening, but she was definitely in a dream. It was 
so surreal, yet...

      &quot;You don&#39;t find me charming in the least? That&#39;s hard to believe.&quot; Erin was broken out 
of her stupor upon hearing a haughty voice. She looked over and in the haze of her dreams, 
she was quite sure it was a woman. Erin wasn&#39;t sure what to say.

      The woman just let out an irritated sound. &quot;You could at least say something.&quot;

      Erin wasn&#39;t sure what came over herself, &quot;What do you want from me?&quot;

      The other woman gritted her teeth. &quot;Why is it that you, of all people, don&#39;t recognize 
my allure?&quot;

      Erin just gave her a sour look. What was that supposed to mean? &quot;Please, I really 
don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; She was quite sure she was sitting down because she 
could see her feet dangling in a river. The woman sat down next to her.

      &quot;Hmph, you&#39;re just being stubborn.&quot;

      Erin was irritated now. &quot;You&#39;re being a brat.&quot; With that, she stood up, leaving the 
other woman stupefied.

      &quot;What? How dare you! I-I am no brat...!&quot; Erin turned around to ask her to leave her 
alone, but she suddenly found herself slammed up against a wall (or tree? Or pillar?) with 
the woman holding her there none too gently.

      &quot;Why? Why is it you? Out of everyone I&#39;ve met, why you?&quot; Erin was sure she was gaping. 
She still couldn&#39;t discern the woman&#39;s appearance, but they were around the same height. 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you notice me...?&quot;

      Erin was even more confused then before, but in a blink of an eye, she found herself 
in another daze. The woman wasn&#39;t there. However, she heard that same strange voice of...

      &quot;Have you woken up?&quot; It was the goddess - she was sure of it.

      Erin said nothing. &quot;You were dreaming of my past, weren&#39;t you? You&#39;re my only 
chance... I know you&#39;re scared.&quot; She could swear that somebody was holding her. &quot;I need you 
and nothing... nothing is going to stop me. For years, you would walk nearby where I was 
sealed and for years, I fed off your energy... then you left.&quot;

      Erin took a gasping breath. &quot;I... I went to college... I&#39;m nobody special, I... I 
don&#39;t understand...&quot;

      &quot;You don&#39;t have to. Soon... soon we&#39;ll be one.&quot; 

***** 

      Erin jumped in the bed, before shooting up. It was morning now. She let out a long 
sigh before flopping down on the sheets. What a horrible night... was that really her 
memory? And was the goddess...? Erin gulped; Seth was right. The goddess would come after 
her, no matter what.

      &quot;&#39;Have you woken up?&#39; Hmm...&quot; Erin repeated to herself. &quot;I guess... this is what she 
meant...&quot;

      The young woman slipped out of the bed, intent on telling Krystal and Isaka what had 
happened. Unfortunately, as she walked to their room, she never stopped to think about why 
they were sharing a room. Erin didn&#39;t consider herself hard of hearing, but she now wished 
she had paid more attention to the seemingly harmless and minute sounds she heard from 
outside the door.

      In front of the wide eyed brunette was a scene that made her wish she knocked. Isaka 
was sprawled on top of Krystal, the sheets tangled on the floor and their legs intimately 
entwined. The blonde haired beauty had her head thrown back, letting out gasps of breath as 
the demon on top of her suckled ravenously at her exposed skin, slowly making her way down 
to Krystal&#39;s breast. The only positive thing about the situation was that both women had 
their clothes on, though barely and extremely disheveled.

      Erin was about to just back out slowly, quite sure it was another dream (or she had 
walked onto the set of a porno)however-

      -Isaka reached her destination and as she ravished Krystal&#39;s breast, the blonde woman 
opened her eyes out of surprise and pleasure before letting out a moan.

      The otherwise romantic moment was spoiled when Krystal noticed Erin out of her 
peripheral vision. &quot;GYAHHH! E-Erin wh-what are you-!&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s exclamation was interrupted as Isaka&#39;s shock and her own surprise caused the 
pair to tumble off the bed in a highly disheveled and tangled state. Erin could only stare 
as the lovers tried to disentangle themselves, albeit reluctantly.

      &quot;Y-you two are... are... together?&quot; Both froze and exchanged looks. &quot;Oh... I guess... 
we, um... didn&#39;t see the relevance in telling you,&quot; Krystal responded honestly. It had never 
come to her mind that maybe she should tell Erin that her and Isaka were in a relationship.

      &quot;Ah, yes, we&#39;re lesbians, Erin. You don&#39;t have to sound so shy about it,&quot; Isaka said 
before giving Krystal a searing glance. &quot;R-r-r-right, I-I&#39;m sorry I came... I-I-I mean, um,&quot; 
Erin stuttered out, her face red from the accidental innuendo. &quot;I&#39;m s-sorry I walked in 
on... on... you know...&quot;

      Instead of getting up, the two sat up on the floor with Isaka holding Krystal 
lovingly. The blonde woman giggled as her demon nuzzled into her neck. Erin averted her eyes 
awkwardly after noticing a few developing hickeys. How did she not notice the two of them 
were lovers? Oh yeah, she was too busy fainting over the thought of being the snake goddess!

      Speaking of snakes... Erin let out a small shriek as the tiny jingling snake slithered 
over to her quite briskly. She froze up as it wrapped around her ankle and started to 
affectionately rub against her. &quot;Why does it... keep doing that...?&quot; Erin whined out, 
resisting the urge to shake it off her leg.

      &quot;Well, that is the snake that kidnapped you, before Krystal downsized it,&quot; Isaka 
murmured. &quot;Since it&#39;s a servant of the goddess, it makes sense that it would be all over 
you.&quot;

  Erin looked down at the snake before shakily extending a hand out to it. When it leapt up 
her arm, she shrieked, but let it slither up to her shoulder and wrap around her arm. 
&quot;H-h-h-h-h-hello th-there...&quot;

      The snake seemed extremely happy and Erin just put on a pathetic smile. &quot;I-I think 
I&#39;ll go downstairs and eat something, um...&quot; She gave one last look at the two lovers, a 
huge blush coming over her face before awkwardly walking out into the hall.

      &quot;Wow... I&#39;m surprised,&quot; Krystal said, laying her head of Isaka&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Erin seems 
to have gotten better with her phobia quite fast... I sense that something&#39;s changed. You 
think she&#39;s accepted being a vessel?&quot;

      Isaka just nodded, but she had other things on her mind. &quot;My gaydar just picked up a 
hidden signal there.&quot;

      Krystal just gave Isaka a disbelieving look. &quot;How can you tell? Erin doesn&#39;t... I 
don&#39;t think she&#39;s like us.&quot;

      The demon just cackled. &quot;Did you see the way she looked at us? Good thing she&#39;s not a 
boy or it would have been too obvious. Seriously, she practically got off on that and that&#39;s 
why she kept looking even though she was embarrassed. Besides, the police said she didn&#39;t 
have a boyfriend.&quot;

      Krystal was about to counter her argument when she felt Isaka&#39;s skilled hand slip in 
to her shirt and cup her breast. &quot;Now that we&#39;re alone, Krystal... I was going to finish 
showing you how gentle I can be.&quot;

      The demon had managed to convince Krystal to let her touch her and one thing led to 
another so... They were right on second base. The exorcist just giggled and started to slide 
down to the floor, the sheets tangling both of them. &quot;You are very tender and loving, 
Isaka...&quot; Krystal started to tentatively push Isaka&#39;s shirt down around her shoulders.

      The demon lifted her lover&#39;s hand over to her heart. &quot;You have no clue how you make me 
feel, Krystal.&quot; They smiled at each other, both with blushes on their faces. Krystal ran her 
fingers through Isaka&#39;s soft glossy brown hair before pulling her down for a kiss. Their 
lips met in perfect harmony and-

      -And they totally forgot that Erin left the door wide open when she left. Thus, poor 
innocent Tycara and the not so innocent minded Seth got quite a sight. &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! 
Isaka what do you think you&#39;re doing?!&quot;

      Tycara&#39;s shriek was much louder than Erin&#39;s and said woman was downstairs trying to 
deal with the snake on her arm. Seth just stared... and blinked... and stared... and 
blinked... before deciding to walk away. &quot;S-Seth? Where are you going?&quot;

      &quot;I-I think I need to take a c-cold shower,&quot; he said in a highly strained voice. 
Luckily, Tycara had no clue what that meant. Instead she followed after him, asking why he 
was walking funny.

      Krystal and Isaka couldn&#39;t believe their luck. &quot;Alright,&quot; the demon murmured, &quot;Third 
time&#39;s a charm, ne?&quot; Her blonde lover just smiled and as they began to intimately kiss and 
wind their bodies together-

      -The door was still wide open and they heard someone clear their throat. Both women 
gulped to see Abby staring down at them, unfazed as ever. &quot;You know, I&#39;m cool with the whole 
lesbian thing. I&#39;m fine with washing the sheets twice and giving you nice a place to stay, 
but isn&#39;t this a bit much? You&#39;re lying on the floor, out in the open as though you&#39;re part 
of a theme park attraction.&quot;

      Krystal looked away guiltily. &quot;S-sorry Abby, we keep forgetting about the door and,&quot; 
Isaka, in the true way of a lover, completed her sentence, &quot;...we were so enraptured with 
each other that we didn&#39;t close it after Erin walked in.&quot;

      &quot;Sorry,&quot; they murmured out simultaneously.

      Abby just threw her hands up in the air. &quot;Seriously! If you&#39;re going to do it like 
that,&quot; the woman started and finished not how the couple thought she would. &quot;...at least let 
Eveon and Mina be here to take notes... or just let me video tape it.&quot;

      They just stared at the 34 year old.

      Abby turned around and threw her arms in the air. &quot;I mean, Eveon&#39;s 16th birthday is 
coming up in a few months or so... What better way to be supportive than to provide her with 
an instructional video?&quot;

      Krystal leaned in to whisper in Isaka&#39;s ear, &quot;What does you gaydar say about that?&quot;

      Isaka just gave her lover a worried glance. &quot;I think it just malfunctioned.&quot;
