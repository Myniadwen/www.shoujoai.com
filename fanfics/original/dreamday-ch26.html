<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 26 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>For the next month or so Kris went directly to her classes and did her 
best to avoid everyone. Whenever she saw Sarah she would feel herself 
stop for a moment, then turn and run the other direction. She couldn&#39;t 
keep her mind on her schoolwork and it was starting to affect her 
grades. 

Mrs. Brookholds tried to talk to the girl to find out what was bothering 
her, but only got a cold &quot;Leave me alone.&quot; as Kris stormed out of the 
class. 

In art class Kris couldn&#39;t focus on the given assignments. Every time 
she brought a brush or pencil to a canvas she would see Jennifer or 
Sarah&#39;s face. One time the teacher told the class to draw a portrait of 
themselves and brought out a bunch of large mirrors for the student to 
use. Kris looked at the person who looked back at her and couldn&#39;t 
believe that was really her. The girl in the reflection looked even more 
like a boy, her baggy silk shirt completely hid any sign of her small 
breasts, her eyes were dark with circles under them and her hair, which 
was usually neatly cut short, was now a mess and looked more like a 
lions mane than anything else. Kris suddenly stood up and threw her 
canvas to the ground screaming, then ran out of the class. 

One day while walking down the hall she saw Sarah standing outside of 
drama class. She couldn&#39;t look at Sarah without feeling like she would 
break into tears, Sarah was fighting with a black cape, and one of her 
friends was trying to help her get it to tie straight. 

Kris rolled her eyes and grabbed the cloak from the girl&#39;s hands. Sarah 
didn&#39;t even see Kris appear and stood there in shock as the girl threw 
the cloak over Sarah&#39;s shoulder and began to tie it. The two didn&#39;t say 
a word. Sarah couldn&#39;t take her eyes off of Kris&#39;s, who made sure she 
only kept her eyes on the task at hand. When Kris was finished she 
brushed the wrinkles out of the cloak and looked the girl over. For a 
brief moment their eyes caught and they stared at each other. Kris 
quickly turned away. She proceeded to stroll down the hall and around 
the corner. 

Someone came running after Kris, &quot;Hey, Wait!&quot; The girl called out. 

Kris turned around to see one of Sarah&#39;s friends running towards her. 
The girl was very tall for her age. She must have stood nearly 6 ft tall 
and had short curly black hair. &quot;Yes?&quot; Kris asked calmly. 

When the girl spoke there was hatred in her voice, &quot;What is it with you? 
Do you have any idea what you are doing to Sarah?&quot; She snarled, waving a 
hand in the direction they just came from.

Kris looked the girl in the eyes, no emotion showed at all, &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; 
She uttered coldly. 

The girl was fuming, &quot;You... You bitch!&quot; Suddenly she slapped Kris 
across the face.

Kris did not move, she simply straighten her head and turned away 
without so much as a word. 

&quot;Hey, Aren&#39;t you going to even say anything?&quot; The girl yelled down the 
hall. 

Kris stopped in her tracks, &quot;Tell Sarah... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She pleaded 
softly, &quot;And watch over her for me would you?&quot; She left the baffled girl 
and continued down the hall towards the office. 

Inside the office she stepped towards the counter and was about to 
announce herself to the secretary when she saw the principal wave her 
into his office. She took a deep breath and walked past the little 
swinging gate into the principal&#39;s office, and sat down when he gestured 
at a chair. 

The principal settled into his chair. He didn&#39;t look pleased at the news 
he had for Kris. To him the girl had a lot of potential. He could tell 
that she was very troubled and it wasn&#39;t entirely her fault that her 
grades were slipping. He let out a deep sigh and spoke, &quot;It looks like 
you have been missing a few classes.&quot;

Kris nodded, she was too tired to protest. She just wished that the 
principal would pull out a gun and shoot her on the spot and end her 
miserable life right now. 

He leaned over his desk, &quot;Listen. We both know that you are going 
through a lot. I mean with getting out of the hospital and all. So maybe 
it would be better for you to go to another school until you finish your 
other classes.&quot;

Kris only blinked, She knew this was coming. She was prepared since the 
day she stepped onto the school grounds that this place was too good to 
be true. They didn&#39;t really want her there, they were looking for some 
poster child and what they got was a psycho, plain and simple. 

&quot;I&#39;ve heard that your doctor has arranged it so you only need to take 
two classes a semester so you won&#39;t be as stressed.&quot; He continued. Kris 
assumed the real reason the doctors let her get away with two classes 
was because they thought she was dumb and couldn&#39;t handle more. She 
would be fine if people would just leave her alone and let her work. 
That included the ghost in her mind. 

&quot;I&#39;ve decided to let you go for now.&quot; The principal tried to think of 
how to put things lightly, &quot;There are a lot of less strenuous schools 
out there and when you finish your primary classes, then you can return 
here to continue your studies in arts here. How does that sound?&quot;     

It sounded to Kris like a &#39;goodbye and don&#39;t let the door hit you on the 
way out&#39;. She looked at the ground and tried to hold herself together. 
Slowly she was learning how to shut off all of her emotions. She stood 
up and looked at the principal. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; was all she could summon 
the will to say. She then turned around and walked out the door. She 
quickly stepped out of the office and ran down the hall to her locker 
where she cleared out her things before she leaving the school. She 
didn&#39;t stop until she was outside and the building was well behind her. 

She stopped and took one last look at the old school. Silently she bid 
everyone farewell. A single snowflake drifted down and touched her 
cheek. She looked up as the first snowfall began. She felt a tear begin 
to escape her eye. Slowly she turned her back to the school and walked 
away, disappearing into the snow. She took the same path as that first 
day she met Sarah. Entering the flower shop to buy the same Lily, then 
ventured on, towards the cemetery. She wove her way through the 
headstones till she came to the resting place of her lost love. Here she 
stood in silence while the snow slowly built up upon the ground. She sat 
on the cold ground leaning against Jennifer&#39;s gravestone. Huddling the 
flower close to her body as the snow gathered on her figure. Shakily she 
pulled out her small note book and wrote:

&quot;Here I huddle up close to her headstone, eyes closed, relief at long 
last. As snow blankets my love and me and mother nature blows me a kiss 
good night, released from the pains and worries am I, for now I join the 
endless sleep of Death.&quot;

She put the book away and curled up on the grave. Prepared to let 
herself fall asleep and never wake up again.
