<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 20 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>The Sisterhood bookstore bustled with life as young
women and a few men shopped away, talked together, and
browsed the shelves. The store carried the expected
books, magazines, DVDs, themed shirts and many other
items, drawing in people from all through the gay,
bisexual, lesbian and transsexual communities.

Alice Sinclare rang up the young man&#39;s purchases with
a smile, putting the condoms and packets of lube in a
bag. &quot;Have a nice day,&quot; the well dressed black haired
woman said, her tailored business suit still crisp and
neat.

&quot;See, I told you it was a good idea to carry them,&quot;
Hunter murmured as she bustled by, the sandy haired
young woman carrying a arm full of magazines. Smoothly
she restocked Advocate, Curve, On our Backs and Out,
even as she chatted to a young lady browsing nearby.

Alice chuckled to herself softly even as she had to
silently concede Hunter&#39;s point. At first she had
fiercely resisted the young woman&#39;s suggestions to
diversify their stock, wanting to keep the store a
pure bookstore, but after the sales she saw during
their first trial of such products she had to give in.
&#39;Besides,&#39; Alice thought as she checked over the
bookmarks that were on display by the till, &#39;it&#39;s
helped our bottom line immensely.&#39;

Yamato Tsujimoto chuckled as she carried over a stack
of English manga from the newly added graphic novel&#39;s
section. &quot;I&#39;m surprised you had so many,&quot; the Japanese
exchange student smiled, her long black hair falling
in a wave.

&quot;The Yuricon website was a big help in choosing
titles,&quot; Alice admitted with a smile as she looked the
mangas over. Chirality, Angel/Dust, Cheeky Angel,
Negima and several others were all in the stack,
prompting her to ask, &quot;I would have thought you
already had them?&quot;

Yamato chuckled, &quot;Back home I do, yes, but I found I
missed reading them here.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s certainly understandable,&quot; Alice agreed,
bagging them up. Dropping her voice a bit she said,
&quot;We&#39;ll be getting some new DVDs in pretty soon, and
I&#39;ve heard that the anime Mai-Hime is coming out in a
few months.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; Yamato chuckled. With
that she slipped out, the busy crowd parting for her
unconsciously powerful presence.

The soft sound of chuckling drew Alice over to the
reference section, where a familiar face was reading a
thick book on Greek mythology. &quot;Something funny?&quot;
Alice asked the athletic looking blonde curiously.

Athena was instantly apologetic, &quot;Sorry, I got carried
away.&quot; Adding the book to the ones she had piled
nearby she asked, &quot;Did any of my orders come in?&quot;

&quot;A few,&quot; Alice nodded, &quot;I&#39;ve got them up front.&quot;

Hunter smiled to herself from where she was watching
the two women, gracefully working the till, handling
the customers and also flirting with the lovely women.
&quot;So,&quot; she purred, &quot;are you busy tonight, Lane?&quot;

Lane laughed, her almost unearthly voice like music in
the busy shop. &quot;Do you know that I&#39;m a transsexual,&quot;
she warned the lovely girl.

Hunter reached out, brushing a bit of the short blonde
hair away from her face. &quot;I can&#39;t say that bothers
me,&quot; she admitted.

Lane smiled back at the younger woman with honest
pleasure, &quot;Then maybe one night I&#39;ll take you up on
that offer.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure you know what you&#39;re getting into?&quot;
Alice asked Hunter as she got Athena&#39;s books together
from beneath the counter.

&quot;No,&quot; Hunter said cheerily, &quot;but that&#39;s part of the
fun.&quot;

Alice rolled her eyes and Hunter laughed.

Athena took a wad of cash from her wallet and handed
it over as she said, &quot;Thank you for bringing in such a
wide range of orders for me.&quot;

Alice smiled &quot;I like a challenge.&quot; Silently she added,
&#39;And considering how much you spend on books, it&#39;s
certainly worth the trouble.&#39; She counted out the
change, &quot;Thank you, and we look forward to seeing you
soon.&quot;

&quot;You too,&quot; Athena agreed. She hesitated a moment, &quot;Do
you think you&#39;ll be coming down to the Daughters of
Artemis again?&quot;

Alice stiffened a bit, then she made herself smile. A
bit of strain was evident in her voice as she said, &quot;I
don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Athena shifted her bag of books to gently
lay a hand on Alice&#39;s arm, &quot;that was a bit tactless of
me.&quot; A pause, &quot;I just don&#39;t want you to think that
you&#39;re in exile from the bar just because Jess is a
regular, too.&quot;

A bit more naturally Alice said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Taking a business card from her wallet Athena
continued, &quot;If you&#39;re worried about running into her
you can even call ahead.&quot;

&quot;For someone who works in a bar she isn&#39;t all that
perceptive,&quot; Hunter commented after Athena had left.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Alice gave her a look.

Hunter smiled grimly, &quot;I bet you&#39;re really avoiding
the Daughters because it&#39;s where you and Jess had your
first date.&quot;

Alice winced, &quot;And you are occasionally too
perceptive.&quot;

&quot;I call &#39;em like I see &#39;em,&quot; Hunter said gently.

Before they could continue the conversation another
group of customers clamored for attention, sending
both young women scurrying to help. Except for short
breaks they stayed pretty busy for most of the
afternoon, finally closing up only as the sun was
beginning to set.

&quot;Money&#39;s locked up in the safe,&quot; Alice said as she
emerged from the back room, &quot;did you finish cleaning
up?&quot;

Hunter hefted two trash bags, &quot;All done.&quot;

After setting the security alarms Alice let Hunter out
of the store then locked the front door, waiting a
moment while Hunter dropped the bags of garbage in the
Trash bin in the alley behind the shop. Together they
walked away from the store, Hunter accompanying her as
had become her habit the last little while.

Hesitantly Alice looked at Hunter, then asked, &quot;How&#39;s
Jess doing?&quot;

&quot;You could go down and see her, you know,&quot; Hunter
said.

&quot;No,&quot; Alice shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to do that
yet.&quot;

Hunter puffed out a breath, running a hand through her
hair. &quot;Jess hit the booze pretty bad for a few
nights,&quot; she said, &quot;but I think she&#39;s got a handle on
it.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Alice winced, &quot;I had to ask.&quot; They walked a
few more steps the she made herself ask, &quot;Is Jess
still seeing Elizabeth?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think she was ever seeing her, at least not
in the way you mean it,&quot; Hunter surprised her by
saying.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Alice blinked.

&quot;They weren&#39;t dating or anything like that,&quot; Hunter
said. She searched for the right words, then finally
had to say, &quot;They were just fuck buddies.&quot;

Alice winced, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to you
talking like that.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the only think they were to each other,&quot;
Hunter said forcefully. She looked up towards the
cloudy sky, &quot;And as far as I know Jess hasn&#39;t been
with anybody since you broke up.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Alice nodded just slightly. Quietly she said,
&quot;I hired a private investigator to look into Jess&#39;
background.&quot;

That surprised Hunter so much she stopped cold, &quot;Are
you sure that&#39;s a good idea? Jess is a... pretty
private person.&quot;

&quot;She keeps secrets,&quot; Alice corrected firmly. She
shrugged, &quot;And I don&#39;t know if it is a good idea, but
I need to know who she is if I&#39;m going to consider
going back to her.&quot;

Hunter nodded glumly, &quot;Well, I hope you don&#39;t end up
regretting this later.&quot;

Alice&#39;s voice was soft, &quot;Me, too.&quot;

To be continued...

Notes: the Sisterhood Bookstore is modeled after
Little Sisters Bookstore in Vancouver, BC, that also
carries a similar variety of items. The characters
that appear here are all from past episodes of Blood
or from Daughters of Artemis.</pre>
