<h1>Project Angelus (part 28 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>      &quot;...um...&quot; Dark&#39;s small utter barely reached Erin&#39;s ears, but the snake goddess 
turned around to look at the angel. Everyone was breaking up to go to their separate rooms 
down the hallway. They&#39;d rented out practically a good portion of the floor, thanks to 
hundreds of years of built up funds from various members of their group.

      &quot;Yes?&quot; Erin asked, reaching out play with a strand of Dark&#39;s hair.

      &quot;I... I... wanted to...&quot; Dark flushed bright red, her gaze going down to the floor.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Faye said, popping her head out of their respective room. &quot;You can 
come in if you want.&quot;

      The love goddess stepped out into the hallway and Dark shyly nodded. &quot;I would like 
that...&quot;

      &quot;If you get nervous, tell us,&quot; Erin said starting to push the angel towards their 
room.

      Faye smiled at Dark. &quot;Are you sure? You don&#39;t have to do anything you don&#39;t want to-&quot;

      &quot;Ah, no way in hell this is happening!&quot;

      All three females turned around to see Marx coming towards them and he wasted no time 
pulling Dark away. &quot;Shame on you, trying to take advantage of poor Dark!&quot;

      The angel looked rather disappointed and upset at the mysterious man holding her 
hand. &quot;Well,&quot; Faye started. &quot;It is Dark&#39;s choice.&quot;

      &quot;Please, as her father, I can&#39;t allow that to happen,&quot; Marx said simply and Dark 
stared at him wide eyed. &quot;I know Dark may want to... get more familiar with you two, if I 
bring her back to Heaven&#39;s Gate not a virgin, my brother-in-law will never let me hear the 
end of it.&quot;

      &quot;Oh, shoot,&quot; Erin said suddenly. &quot;If we do sleep with Dark, the angels might not be 
too happy.&quot;

      &quot;...father...?&quot; Dark asked timidly and Marx looked down at her.

      &quot;Yeah, that would be me... I&#39;m sorry I left you behind, but... your uncle took good 
care of you didn&#39;t he?&quot; Marx asked hopefully. Dark nodded, but clung onto him.

      He adjusted his fedora with a small smile. &quot;I need to talk with her anyway. After 
she&#39;s gone back to Heaven&#39;s Gate and proven she&#39;s fine, she can come back and have fun with 
you.&quot;

      As he walked off, the goddesses were disappointed. &quot;But she won&#39;t be going back to 
Heaven&#39;s Gate for a while,&quot; Faye mused.

      &quot;There goes our harem...&quot; Erin sighed.

      It was then that unfortunate little Alice came out into the hallway. Erin and Faye 
quickly exchanged glances before turning their attentions to the green eyed girl. Alice 
stopped when she noticed she was being watch before quickening her pace to the room where 
Eveon was staying.

      &quot;So you&#39;re Alice?&quot; Faye asked, grabbing the girl around the waist before she could 
escape.

      &quot;Uh, y-yeah...&quot; she choked out at Erin placed a hand on her shoulder.

      &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; the green haired girl stated with a smile. &quot;Do you have a 
room to stay in tonight?&quot;

      &quot;I was going to stay with Eveon,&quot; Alice said, trying to wriggle out of their grasp.

      Erin and Faye exchanged glances. &quot;Well,&quot; the red head started, &quot;Eveon is staying with 
her mommies... so how about you stay with us?&quot;

      Alice froze up, nervous. &quot;Are you... uh... Erin and Faye?&quot;

      The lovers exchanged glances. &quot;Our reputation precedes us,&quot; Erin murmured.

      Alice tried to move away. &quot;That&#39;s fine! I&#39;ll just go to bed now-!&quot;

      She let out a squeak as Faye held her close to her own body. The red head stared into 
her eyes deeply and Alice started to feel funny. Erin leaned in and nipped at Alice&#39;s neck. 
&quot;Aren&#39;t you at least curious?&quot;

      &quot;Ah, I...&quot; Alice started, still looking at Faye&#39;s dazzling eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t want 
to...!&quot;

      &quot;We aren&#39;t going to do anything you don&#39;t want,&quot; Faye said, running a hand under 
Alice&#39;s shirt. &quot;Just some cuddling - we know you don&#39;t want to go any further than that.&quot;

      Alice tensed up as the love goddess stroked her vulnerable abdomen. Erin chuckled. 
&quot;We aren&#39;t going to force anything on you, we promise.&quot;

      Just as the green eyed girl figured she was stuck with sleeping in their room, a 
voice cut in. &quot;I believe Alice isn&#39;t ready for something like that.

      She never thought she&#39;d be so happy to see Hoshi, but Alice was relieved to see the 
silver haired woman standing confidently in the hallway, there to her rescue. &quot;Plus, she&#39;s 
my honorary sister.&quot;

      Erin and Faye seemed oddly disappointed. &quot;Don&#39;t you already have your sisters?&quot; Faye 
asked. &quot;Erin and I were hoping for a little threeway action, but since Dark can&#39;t do it, 
can&#39;t we at least cuddle with Alice?&quot;

      Hoshi sighed. &quot;You know that Alice doesn&#39;t want to do that...&quot;

      Erin smiled. &quot;But a girl&#39;s sexuality is especially fluid, so it&#39;s not like Alice 
won&#39;t enjoy it-&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t wanna be fluid,&quot; Alice whined out.

      Faye laughed. &quot;Looks like you&#39;re popular, Alice.&quot; With that, the two goddesses 
released her and the young girl was relieved.

      Erin ruffled her hair. &quot;If you ever want to... talk... Faye and I would be happy to 
keep you company.&quot;

      &quot;Right,&quot; Alice said blandly, though happy that they weren&#39;t attacking her. &quot;Thanks 
for not violating me.&quot;

      Faye laughed at her wording. &quot;Of course! It&#39;s not fun if you&#39;re not a willing 
participant.&quot;

      Hoshi placed her hands on Alice&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You&#39;re going to be sleeping in our room 
tonight.&quot; Her golden eyes sparkled mischievously and Alice wondered if she&#39;d really chosen 
the less of two evils...

      &quot;No, she&#39;s not.&quot;

      Alice was ecstatic to hear a very male voice cutting in. &quot;I come back a second time 
and see you guys trying to net in another young girl?&quot; Marx asked, holding a bucket of ice. 
&quot;You&#39;re depraved.&quot;

      Faye rolled her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s not like she needs to be a virgin and taken back to 
Heaven&#39;s Gate.&quot;

      &quot;I thought you said you weren&#39;t going to violate me!&quot; Alice retorted.

      Erin giggled. &quot;Well, in case you did want to take it to the next level...&quot;

      Hoshi smiled at Marx. &quot;She&#39;ll be fine with us.&quot;

      Marx looked between the three of them before grabbing Alice by the hand. &quot;She still 
has my very virgin daughter&#39;s soul inside of her, so I think she&#39;ll be staying in my room.&quot;

      With that, he took her away. Hoshi sighed. &quot;I suppose I&#39;ll have to disappoint my 
sisters...&quot;

      Erin looked over at Faye. &quot;We can still have fun.&quot;

      Faye nodded as she pulled Erin into the room. &quot;I was already planning on it...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;We&#39;re heading towards the gate,&quot; Adrian said simply as the helicopter behind him was 
being prepared.

      &quot;Already?&quot; Eric asked, astonished. &quot;But Eveon hasn&#39;t even started heading there.&quot;

      &quot;I want to be early for when she does do it,&quot; Adrian said as Lilith came up to the 
roof from the stairwell. &quot;I can&#39;t take any chances.&quot;

      &quot;What about the fiends?&quot; Eric asked, crossing his arms.

      &quot;I don&#39;t particularly want them there, but they will be stalling all of Eveon&#39;s 
friends,&quot; Adrian murmured as Lilith came over and kissed him.

      Lilith looked over at Eric, frowning. &quot;Aren&#39;t you ready to go?&quot;

      Eric sighed, ruffling his messy hair. &quot;I&#39;ll go get ready...&quot;

      He walked over to the stairs to go back to his floor as Adrian turned to Lilith. &quot;I 
need you to be able to fight Eveon&#39;s friends.&quot;

      She nodded. &quot;I... I can do it. I won&#39;t hold back.&quot;

      &quot;Good,&quot; he said, nodding. &quot;We just need Eveon to get motivated.&quot;

      &quot;Pandora said that she is. Mina&#39;s already been shown to her,&quot; Lilith reported as they 
started heading towards the helicopter to wait for Eric.

      The young man leaned back in his chair, looking up at the helicopter ceiling. &quot;The 
time is close...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Aren&#39;t you worried about leaving Seth alone?&quot; Abby asked as she combed through 
Tycara&#39;s hair.

      &quot;Nope. He&#39;s safe in his room and Bakra and Josh are next door,&quot; Tycara said with a 
smile before turning around. &quot;Plus... Krystal said she took care of it.&quot;

      Abby stifled her laughter. &quot;Oh, she took care of it alright...&quot;

      Sakura and Eveon were already beneath the sheets of the huge king sized bed when Abby 
and Tycara joined them. &quot;Hey, Sakura,&quot; Eveon asked. &quot;Where does your armor go?&quot;

      Her stepmother just stared at her before suddenly erupting in flames. Eveon almost 
leapt out of the bed, along with an equally surprised Tycara, while Abby cuddled up to a 
now smoking Sakura. &quot;It comes out of her,&quot; Abby answered. &quot;Purgatory sealed up an immense 
power in her body so she&#39;s stronger.&quot;

      Eveon jumped anyway as the flames dispersed along with the armor. She warily settled 
back into the bed, looking around at her family. &quot;So... how are we going to do this?&quot; After 
much shuffling of sheets, Abby turned out the lamp.

      Abby and Sakura were at each end, holding their daughters between them. &quot;Everything&#39;s 
going to be alright,&quot; Tycara said with a smile. &quot;Seth&#39;s looking up ways to help Mina right 
now.&quot;

      Eveon nodded, but she could feel the sadness welling up inside of her as she settled 
into Abby. She rubbed her right hand, thinking all the while. 

***** 

      &quot;So I have this bed,&quot; Marx said, pointing to one on the left. &quot;And you can share the 
other with Dark.&quot;

      The angel looked up as they walked in, having patiently sat down on the bedspread. 
Marx smiled at her and the angel seemed relieved. &quot;This is Alice - she&#39;s the one who tried 
to save you and she has your half sister&#39;s soul.&quot;

      Alice waved timidly before going over to the bed. &quot;...I&#39;m glad you&#39;re alright.&quot;

      Dark opened her mouth and closed it before actually thinking of something to say. 
&quot;Thank you... thank you for saving me.&quot;

      Alice gave her a bright smile. &quot;Of course.&quot;

      It was then that Dark&#39;s face went bright red and she redirected her gaze to the 
ground. Alice felt a strange tickle in her head before realizing something was up... and 
her suspicions were reaffirmed when Dark hugged her fiercely.

      &quot;I guess she likes you,&quot; Marx said with a laugh.

      Alice tried to get out of her hold, but Dark instead nuzzled into Alice&#39;s abdomen. 
&quot;...my sister...&quot;

      When they finally went to bed, Alice was trapped with Dark holding onto her and her 
ever so soft wings wrapped around them. Sure... her wings were very, very nice, but that 
didn&#39;t make the situation less awkward... and whenever Alice attempted to move and ruffled 
one of the wings, Dark let out a little whimper.

      Would she never be saved?!

      The green eyed girl jolted up in the bed when she heard a light knock on the door. 
Marx was sleeping and so was Dark. Regardless of the whimpers, Alice easily slipped out of 
Dark&#39;s grasp and the angel curled up in a little ball.

      When she answered the door, she was surprised to see Eveon standing out there with 
her backpack, fully dressed. &quot;Could you get ready? Don&#39;t wake them.&quot;

      Alice wanted to ask her questions, but she quickly changed and grabbed her own things 
as Eveon led her to an elevator. &quot;I&#39;m going to the gate.&quot;

      Before Alice could loudly protest, Eveon yanked her into the elevator. &quot;What?! Are 
you insane?&quot;

      Eveon guiltily held up her right hand. &quot;I can&#39;t stop thinking about Mina. I want to 
save her.&quot; The Seal of Light was glowing a strange, ethereal color.

      Alice&#39;s heart dropped. &quot;It&#39;s becoming the Key to God.&quot;

      Eveon nodded as the elevator descended to the lobby. &quot;I know everyone will try to 
stop me, but I have to do it. You&#39;ll help me, won&#39;t you?&quot;

      Alice looked down at the ground. &quot;Yeah... I promised I would always protect you...&quot;

      &quot;If I can get that power,&quot; Eveon said, her voice shaking. &quot;I could save Mina and stop 
the Shadow Organization.&quot;

      Alice bit her lip. &quot;But what if... what if you get overwhelmed by power?&quot;

      &quot;Then at least I tried...&quot; Eveon said, obviously nervous. &quot;Maybe... maybe I could use 
this power to help people... but then where would it stop? Is it selfish that I only want 
to save Mina...?&quot;

      Alice shook her head. &quot;No - even if you could bring back the dead, I think you 
shouldn&#39;t... are you sure you don&#39;t want to get anyone else?&quot;

      &quot;They&#39;d try to stop me,&quot; Eveon reasoned. &quot;I could get captured, but you&#39;ll protect 
me, so it&#39;s no problem!&quot;

      &quot;...how are we going to get there?&quot; Alice asked as they walked through the lobby and 
out the front doors.

      &quot;I can feel where it is... and can&#39;t you fly like Lilith?&quot;

      Alice sighed. &quot;I&#39;m not a pack mule, you know?&quot;
