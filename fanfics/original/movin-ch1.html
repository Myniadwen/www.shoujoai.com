<h1>Moving In</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/syd.html">Syd</a><br> </h2>
<pre>My mother was not so happy when I told her that I was moving out of the 
house. I&#39;m 18 and she was moving to Kansas. I was not too happy with the 
idea. Jeanna, my co-worker and the girl I had a crush on decided I could 
move in with her. So today is moving day, my Mother has already left for 
Kansas and the house is open just for a few days to get my remaining 
things out. Jeanna and I were off work today so we could move my things 
out. And this is how our story begins... 

&quot;Hey Jeanna! Come help me with this furniture.&quot; 

Jeanna sighs. &quot;Can&#39;t we take a cigarette break? We just moved all the 
boxes and your dresser.&quot; 

&quot;Just let&#39;s get the bed out ok?&quot; I tried to persuade her. 

&quot;Fine.&quot; 

I get in front of one side of the bed and she gets the other. I am 
walking backwards and she and I pick up the bed and she moves suddenly 
pushing me and the bed into a wall jamming my back against the side of 
the door frame and my hand into it as well. 

&quot;Christ!&quot; I yell, though I am still holding the bed, wincing at the 
pain. 

&quot;Shit! Are you ok Traci? 

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I&#39;m fine. Let&#39;s just try to get this bed in the truck.&quot; I 
said as my face was still contorted with stabbing pain along my back and 
hand. Jeanna was just being her compassionate Pisces self with me being 
a very stubborn single-minded Sagittarius. 

With great difficulty and slowness we got the bed in the back of the 
truck. That was the last of the furniture we had to pack. Everything 
that I couldn&#39;t pack into Jeanna&#39;s house I sent with my Mom to Kansas 
where I wouldn&#39;t have to pay for storage. 

&quot;Now I need a cigarette.&quot; I said as I pulled out the Djarum clove 
cigarettes which Jeanna had got me started on. I tried to light my 
cigarette but my right hand hurt so bad I couldn&#39;t move my first two 
fingers to hold the lighter. Jeanna noticed and lit my cigarette for me. 
Jeanna being her unconventional self thought it better to light my 
cigarette off of hers. I blushed as I felt her face so close to mine and 
closed my eyes as to not be staring into hers with longing I could not 
hide. Part of me thought &#39;How can she not know how I feel about her? 
Sometimes I feel the passion is radiating from me&#39; 

&quot;Let me see your hand,&quot; she said softly. I trustingly gave it to her. 
This was not the first time her hands had touched mine. I remember the 
others very vividly. The first time was when a jumping cactus had gotten 
needles stuck in my hand and she tried to get them out for me. I 
remember jokingly saying to her, &#39;Your hands are sweaty.&#39; She replied 
coyly by saying, &#39;It&#39;s cause I&#39;ve been wanting to hold your hand.&#39; 

She gently prodded my hand feeling the joints. I winced a little but 
tried to keep passive. I just took a long drag off my cigarette. I do 
not know if I was feeling flushed because of the desert heat or because 
the love of my life was touching my hand. Jeanna broke me out of my 
daydream. 

&quot;I think you may have broken your fingers.&quot; 

&quot;Great,&quot; was all I could reply. &quot;Does this mean I don&#39;t have to take 
calls, or I have to do them one handed?&quot; We both worked at a call center 
for 411 cell phone services and typing was a necessity. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know, you&#39;ll have to go see the doctor soon and see what he 
says. It could be a medical leave of absence. How is your back?&quot; she 
asked sincerely? 

&quot;Painful, but I think my hand is the worst of it. I can stand and all. 
It&#39;s just a little sore.&quot; 

&quot;Well I will massage it for you when we get home. We&#39;ll see how you are 
in a few hours before we start getting the heavier things out,&quot; she 
smiled and brushed her purple bangs out of her eyes as the hot desert 
Tucson wind was picking up. 

I had to turn my face away. I remembered the last time she gave me a 
massage. It was wonderful to feel her hands on my back, tenderly working 
out all the stress of the day. 

I got in my car and followed Jeanna&#39;s car back through downtown to get 
to my new home. After we got to the house I grabbed a box and she 
grabbed two and put them inside the room. The boxes were small and I 
wasn&#39;t going to let boxes get in the way of me moving in. The furniture 
would have to wait but luckily I really did not have that much stuff. 
Still after months of being here, my aunt and uncle have not sent me my 
things from North Carolina. It only took about 15 minutes to get the 
boxes in, we did not unpack them yet, just got them inside. 

I laid face down on the couch and Jeanna knew that was the cue that the 
pain was finally catching up with me. She straddled me and started 
gently and first at the base of my neck and worked her way down my back. 
I had hit the right side on the door frame and she had found lots of 
tender spots there as she felt my back muscles tightening but found many 
knots as well. 

&quot;Can you take off your shirt? I want to check for bruising,&quot; Jeanna said 
softly. 

Thank God my face was down in the couch, she wouldn&#39;t notice the blush 
that swept over my face. But I complied and took off my shirt. I 
fidgeted a bit, feeling aroused. I could feel her straddled over my 
waist and her hands on my naked back. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As I watched Traci take off her shirt. I was wondering what she was 
thinking. Yes, Traci is a little younger than me but she reminds me of 
everything I wanted to be at her age. Even looking at a slightly bruised 
back, she is shaped perfectly. I cannot believe that she doesn&#39;t like 
her body. I could feel the flushing of my face as I was thinking these 
thoughts. I continued to work the muscles in her back fighting urges not 
to make a move on her. 

It is going to be so hard to be living with her, thought Jeanna to 
herself. Well we have already talked about bisexuality. She only does 
not label herself as one because she has never had an experience with a 
female, though I would like to mend that. I laughed silently to myself 
as I remembered the first real hint of attraction between us. I was 
taking Traci home from hanging out and we were in the driveway of her 
house for five minutes just play fighting and I told her that her mom is 
going to think we were making out or something. Traci then made a joke 
about how she could say she lost her virginity to me. I then said that 
&#39;Yeah, I popped your cherry with my two fingernails.&#39; I don&#39;t know if 
she was a little scared with that comment or not. Traci is so hard to 
read sometimes, though I know she likes to hide her feelings, especially 
from people. It takes her awhile to trust others, also a lot like me but 
I completely trust her. She is so mature for her age. 

I stopped massaging her for a minute just lost in the reverie. Traci 
turned over, oblivious that she was just in her bra with me on top of 
her. 

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; she said. She can be so na&iuml;ve at times I swear. She doesn&#39;t 
see it does she? Perhaps she is blinded with her own passion. Hah...too 
mush wishful thinking Jeanna, you&#39;re too old for her. 

&quot;Do you remember that night that we made the joke about you losing your 
virginity to me...?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, why? Is something wrong?&quot; Traci asks. 

&quot;No, maybe I&#39;m being a little forward in this but...&quot; 

Traci was in a little shock. She didn&#39;t know if she should be terrified 
right now or expect something life changing for her. 

&quot;...there was some truth in that,&quot; she finished. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t really pop my cherry you know, that happened without sex,&quot; I 
said jokingly. 

Jeanna smiled at that. &quot;That&#39;s true but even with the age gap between us 
I have had this attraction to you, not just sexually, but you and I are 
so much alike and you are exactly how I wanted to be at your age.&quot; 

&quot;Really? You are who I want to be,&quot; I said kind of stunned at her 
statement, &quot;but I also have reciprocated feelings toward you.&quot; Jeanna 
then bent down and put her soft lips on mine waiting for me to see how 
far I would go in the kiss. I opened my mouth a bit and pressed my left 
hand behind her head helping her confidence. The kiss soon deepened and 
felt her reposition herself on top of me no longer bending down. Her 
hand caressed my stomach. A sigh escaped my lips as her touch no matter 
where it was seemed tickling and teasing. Her hand began to move higher 
towards my breast where it laid for a moment. I arched my back a little 
to show her my need in my breasts. 

While my back was arched she reached around and unclasped my bra leaving 
me top naked and she threw it to the floor. I sat up and the kiss broke 
but I leaned into her, our foreheads touching as I gazed into those deep 
blue eyes. 

&quot;You need to get naked too you know,&quot; I whispered. I helped her take off 
her shirt and bra and still sitting up I nipped at her breast. I was so 
glad I had read all those fan-fics so I knew what to do now. I think she 
was surprised as well that I knew what to do though I had never been in 
a physical relationship with a girl before. I could hear her begin to 
sigh with pleasure as my tongue continued to flick over her amazingly 
erect nipples. My hands moved to her waist caressing her stomach. I was 
getting so wet as I saw her head roll back and her eyes shut in 
pleasure. 

Traci was just so amazing and sensual it was hard to believe she had 
never been in a physical relationship with a girl before. Really she had 
never even had sex with a guy. She was taking control and at least this 
time I had to regain it before she took me over the edge. I was supposed 
to be teaching her. I regained composure as much as you can during 
foreplay and held her close feeling her hands wrap around my neck and 
back as I began to bite and nip her neck. I felt her knee move in 
between my legs pressing firmly against my sex and I rubbed against it. 
I was getting so wet now. 

She began to rock her hips a little bit. I knew she must be wet by now. 
But, prolonging foreplay does make better sex and I wanted Traci to 
remember this. I moved my way down her body, leaving nips and kisses. 
Finally I got to her belt and slowly unfastened it. She looked down at 
me and I gave her one of those grins that we only give each other, even 
as friends. I was straddling her again and repositioned my self after I 
had got her black pants off. They too fell to the floor. I then took off 
my pants as well, both of us were now only in our underwear. She was 
wearing a black thong with red string bikini ties. Before I took those 
off I just rubbed her sex a bit. She was really wet, as was I. This is 
probably the most wet I have been in a long time just in foreplay. She 
closed her eyes and moaned as I took my hand away. 

I can&#39;t believe this is happening finally! I must be dreaming. I had 
felt her take her hand away but knew she was going to do something. She 
slid my panties off slowly. Oh, how she just teases me! 

&quot;Stop teasing Jeanna,&quot; I managed to get out. 

Jeanna laughed and I felt her stroking my inner thighs and just brushing 
my clit. &quot;This is supposed to be the way you get turned on right? Isn&#39;t 
it your thighs little Sagittarius?&quot; 

&quot;Ohhhh,&quot; I was beginning to moan as she gently flicked over my clit. I 
couldn&#39;t take the teasing anymore and brought my hand down to finger 
myself. She stopped my hand and held it fast. 

&quot;No no, this is my job to do remember? I&#39;m the one who gets to take your 
virginity,&quot; Jeanna said seductively in that phone sex voice of hers she 
sometimes lets slide out on the phones. 

&quot;You&#39;re using the phone sex voice Jeanna,&quot; I said with a smirk. 

&quot;How can I help you today? Can I help you lose your virginity?&quot; That 
voice always gets me. 

&quot;Please take it Jeanna, take me...now,&quot; I reply in my own phone sex 
voice. Jeanna smiles and begins to rub the outer lips of my sex while 
fondling my right breast. 

&quot;Ohhh god Jeanna...&quot; I could manage to get out. She strokes my clit with 
one hand while the other penetrates me with two fingers. She begins 
stroking slowly and then picks up the pace. My back is arching and my 
hips are matching her pace, searching for release. I feel the sweat 
begin to bead on my face and I start to breathe heavily. 

&quot;Traci you&#39;re going to come any second I can feel it, you&#39;re tightening 
up, just let go,&quot; It seems that Jeanna is coaching me. 

My moanings become louder and more frequent. My body gyrating against 
her hand harder and harder. I feel something like a jolt from my sex up 
my spine and I knew I had come, I almost screamed in release. I must 
have blacked out for a second cause when I awoke Jeanna&#39;s hand was no 
longer inside me but she was holding me. I looked into her face and saw 
an amazing amount of love and satisfaction radiating from her face. I&#39;m 
sure she saw the same thing on mine as well. I just leaned into her and 
closed my eyes in abandon. Jeanna is just everything that I want in 
life. Just her, just us...just now. 

&quot;You haven&#39;t experienced everything yet, cigarette break and then this 
next orgasm will drain you for sure.&quot; 

I just laughed. Jeanna is just so blunt about things. That is one of the 
things I like most about her. Both of us are not that great talking 
about our feelings but we both just understand each other. Through the 
story of our lives, it just shows we were meant to be together. 

I layed in Jeanna&#39;s lap and her hands ran through my blue hair, which 
she helped me dye, as we smoked. I finished my clove and sat up in her 
lap, my arms around her, being careful of my right hand, she held it and 
gently stroked it. We just looked into each others eyes, both of us were 
still naked. Jeanna&#39;s underwear had come off somewhere in the mess of it 
all. 

&quot;We need the bedroom for this now.&quot; Jeanna said softly. 

&quot;Kinky.&quot; I replied. I got up and put my hands against her bare 
shoulders, hers against my hips and we made our way to the bedroom 
kissing wildly. She gently pushed me onto her bed still messy from the 
morning. She kissed me deeply holding my left hand fiercely. Her kisses 
trailed down to my waist and she didn&#39;t stop there this time. And I knew 
what she was going to do. 

It wasn&#39;t hard to push Traci over the edge the first time, but she also 
had never had sex before, she is a little...sensitive to the feelings. I 
pushed my arms under her thighs and held onto her as I gave one teasing 
lick to her clit. There of course was immediate reaction and she moaned. 
She was grabbing her own breasts in deep need. 

I nibbled on her clit a little and her moaning intensified. 

&quot;Do you like that?&quot; A nod was all Traci could manage and a moan. I 
thrust my tongue inside of her devouring her delicious juices. She was 
so sweet. And still sooo wet. Exploring the inside of her I felt her 
hands stroking and grabbing my hair. She always had this obsession with 
my hair. I mean it is purple and short and all but I don&#39;t know what she 
has with messing up my hair. Whenever she would see me at work she would 
either mess up my hair completely or pat my head. Then I started doing 
it to her, its like a joke between us. 

I sucked on her clit and had to help her hold her down, she was 
thrusting madly now. I was stroking her thighs with my right hand and 
making my way to rub her clit as I was sucking wildly on her sex. I 
would lightly run my nails over her thigh and she would almost shiver 
with pleasure. Her moans were definitely more frequent and I had found 
myself moaning too. I felt as if I was going to come just going down on 
her. No one has ever done that to me it was amazing. I had to finger 
myself at the same time cause I needed the release but I needed to keep 
my focus on Traci. Right then is when she came as I gave one more nip 
and pull to her clit. 

I didn&#39;t pass out this time but the feeling was definitely more intense 
before and during orgasm. I saw Jeanna fingering herself and I smiled 
evilly. 

&quot;You&#39;re in need of assistance?Let me help you.&quot; I said in our sexy 
voice. She sighed and leaned back as I straddled her. Kissing her deeply 
and feeling every part of her that I could made my way down. Her knee 
was lodged in between my thighs and I finally made my way down on her 
and spread her legs and took a couple licks on her clit feeling her 
shudder with anticipation. I was feeling a little self-conscious, hoping 
I did everything right. 

&quot;Tell me what you like love,&quot; I said tenderly. 

&quot;You...inside of me,&quot; was all she could muster as I got back to nipping 
at her clit. Pressing my thumb on her clit I shoved two fingers inside 
of her and held her shoulder as she began to rock against my hand. I 
explored the inside of her sex trying to find the place to make her 
scream my name. After a few minutes I found it and she came loudly and 
it was long. The cum was seeping into my hand as I took out my hand and 
began to suck on her sex, devouring all the cum. She tasted good. I had 
always wondered what it was like to go down on a girl and I found out it 
was the lovliest thing in the world. She was still coming and moaning 
loudly. 

I felt her orgasm subside and I curled up beside her and kissed her 
deeply and laid on her shoulder. 

&quot;Am I a fast learner or what?&quot; I asked. 

&quot;The fastest I&#39;ve ever seen, you must have done your homework.&quot; Jeanna 
said. 

&quot;I wanted you to be my first.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m happy to be of assistance.&quot; Jeanna said with a smirk. I smiled and 
we pulled up the sheets. 

&quot;So I guess I won&#39;t be sleeping in my bed all that often eh?&quot; 

&quot;I guess not Traci.&quot; </pre>
