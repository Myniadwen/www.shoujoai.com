<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>&quot;You can hear me?&quot; the ghost girl said. Surprised from
her rage a moment ago she looked less misty and more
human, a shimmering figure floating in midair. The
young lady was young, maybe in her twenties, and
flashes of color implied that her hair and eyes were a
gentle brown.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jess replied confidently, though honestly
she was a bit startled she could do it, too. &#39;I wonder
if it happened because I drew on my powers in here?&#39;
she wondered.

With a cry the ghost girl swirled around Jess,
trailing glittering mist as she said, &quot;I&#39;ve been so
lonely!&quot;

&quot;Take it easy,&quot; Jess tried to keep her tone gentle as
she comforted the ghost, calming the crying woman
down. After a few moments the woman had stopped
crying, and hovered beside Jess as she sat on the side
of the bed. &quot;So,&quot; she began, &quot;you&#39;ve been haunting
this room for the last hundred years or so?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the ghost sniffled, &quot;since the fire.&quot;

&#39;All right,&#39; Jess mused as she sat down on the bed,
&#39;talking to a few real ghost busters, I found out that
usually a ghost lingers because they didn&#39;t finish
something important in their lives. I wonder what
her&#39;s was?&#39;

The ghost girl looked at Jess searchingly as she said,
&quot;My name is Karen, what&#39;s yours?&quot;

&quot;Jess,&quot; she smiled back as Karen drifted over,
settling on the bed beside her.

Karen smiled fleetingly, &quot;That sounds like a boy&#39;s
name, Jess.&quot; She teasingly asked, &quot;Are you really a
Jessica?&quot;

Jess snickered softly as she met the girl&#39;s shining
eyes and answered, &quot;No, I&#39;m certainly not a Jessica.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; an Karen leaned forward to press her lips to
Jess&#39;.

Jess froze for a moment as the ghost tentatively
kissed her, then jerked back with a cry of surprise,
&quot;What the...?!&quot;

Karen looked at her with wide eyes, then suddenly
began crying again as she wailed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m so
sorry!&quot;

Jess shook herself as she moved back over, &quot;No, you
just surprised me...&quot; Karen looked up, tears
glittering on ghostly cheeks as Jess asked, &quot;Why did
you...?&quot;

Karen was blushing as she wiped her eyes, &quot;I.. I&#39;m
seventeen years old and I don&#39;t want to be a virgin
any more!&quot;

Jess could feel her jaw drop as she blinked at the
ghost girl. Thankfully, Karen was too upset to notice
that. &quot;You mean,&quot; Jess stopped, unsure how to put the
question without sounding crass or rude.

Karen sniffed a bit, &quot;You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like! I
lived in a dorm for months, all girls, and I could
hear them!&quot;

&quot;Hear what?&quot; Jess asked, still mildly stunned.

&quot;That,&quot; Karen gave her a significant look.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Jess winced.

Karen pulled her knees up to her chest, &quot;There was a
upperclassman I admired, but I never got up the
courage to ask her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jess patted her shoulder.

Karen looked at Jess searchingly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I scared
you.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t really mind,&quot; Jess admitted, &quot;you just
surprised me.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Karen asked softly.

&quot;Really,&quot; Jess said reassuringly.

&quot;Really really?&quot; now Karen&#39;s eyes twinkled with a bit
of humor as she relaxed a little.

Jess chuckled, &quot;Yes.&quot; Silently she began to wonder,
&#39;Is that why Karen couldn&#39;t move on? And if so... am I
going to have to do what I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m going to
have to do?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; and Karen seemed to spring forward,
wrapping her arms arounf Jess and kissing her
forcefully.

&#39;Yep,&#39; Jess thought as she was bowled over by the
eager young woman.

Hot kisses rained on Jess face as Karen squirmed
eagerly against her, the ghostly girl&#39;s misty clothes
having disappeared to reveal a slim but attractive
body. With a surprising show of strength she began to
pull off Jess&#39; clothes, kissing and stroking bared
skin as it was exposed to her fevered touch.

&quot;Easy,&quot; Jess gasped as Karen kissed a hardened nipple,
&quot;we&#39;ve got time.&quot;

&quot;I missed out on this in life,&quot; Karen murmured as she
kissed down the length of Jess&#39; belly, &quot;I&#39;m not
wasting any time now.&quot;

Downstairs, Chris winced as she heard another bump.
The redhead pulled her robe around her as she drank
some cocoa, listening to the epic battle going on
upstairs between man and spirit. There had been the
usual loud thumps when Jess first went upstairs, then
a longer period of eerie silence, and now there was
more banging And yelling, almost like cries of pain.

&#39;Or...&#39; Chris stopped, thinking of another
possibility. Then she shook her head firmly as she
said aloud, &quot;Nah.&quot; Listening to more thumping, cries
and moans Chris got up, walking over to her fridge.
&quot;If this is going to be going all night,&quot; she sighed,
&quot;I need a drink.&quot;

The next morning Jess staggered downstairs as Chris
looked on, wide eyed. Her black tank top was torn on
one of the straps, her jeans were stained and her eyes
were blood shot. In summary, she looked like something
the cat would refuse to drag in.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Chris rushed over to look Jess
over carefully, her nightie and robe swirling around
her.

&quot;Coffee,&quot; Jess croaked, wincing visibly.

&quot;Ah, right,&quot; Chris guided Jess over to the kitchen
table, then hurried to make up some coffee. &quot;How to
you take it?&quot;

&quot;Today, black,&quot; Jess winced.

Pouring the cup Chris hurried to her side, &quot;Here you
go.&quot;

Jess grabbed the cup thankfully she drank, wincing a
bit at the taste. &quot;Oh, thank you,&quot; she sighed after a
moment.

Pouring herself a cup Chris sat beside Jess, watching
her drink as if it was her last day on earth. &quot;Are you
all right?&quot; she repeated.

&quot;Just exhausted,&quot; Jess sighed as she finished her cup
in one gulp.

&quot;The ghost,&quot; Chris hesitated, &quot;Is the ghost still
there?&quot;

Jess gave a odd smile, one both sad and satisfied too.
&quot;No, I think she&#39;s satisfied,&quot; she said after a
moment, &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll linger any longer.&quot;

&quot;Satisfied?&quot; Chris blinked.

Jess blushed slightly, &quot;Long story.&quot;

Chris debated asking, then decided she wasn&#39;t all that
sure she wanted to know. &quot;So what do I owe you?&quot; she
asked briskly.

Jess hesitated a moment then smiled, &quot;How about we
start with breakfast, then we&#39;ll see what we can do?&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Chris chuckled. She paused, &quot;What was all
that noise last night?&quot;

&quot;It was a rough fight,&quot; Jess said, oddly blushing
while she continued, &quot;but I conquered it in the end.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Chris nodded.</pre>
