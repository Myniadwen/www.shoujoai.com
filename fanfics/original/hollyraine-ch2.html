<h1>The Misadventures of Holly-Raine (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hollyraine-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Debbie rubbed a solitary tear from her eye. Hard as it was to believe, 
this fully grown educator had been crying. Not very grown up, not very 
mature, but then love always messes you up like that. The 34-year-old 
teacher tried hard to get her bearings. First of all she made it of the 
utmost urgency to wipe her eyes free of the tears. The last thing she 
needed was for a student to come in and make a fuss over her. Debbie had 
worked hard to earn the respect she held, she didn&#146;t want to lose that 
all thanks to some miserable argument with Linda. 

The second thing she made it of the greatest urgency was to smooth out 
her clothes a bit. Linda had a bit of a roaming streak; so ruffled 
clothes were not a new idea. All the same, she didn&#146;t want to look 
scruffy in front of her pupils. Unlike most teachers, Debbie really 
cared about the kids she was teaching, and wanted to do right by them, 
by giving them all they needed in life. Which was why she went to such 
efforts to keep their focus on the work, and was also why she tried as 
hard as she possibly could to put her own problems behind her. 

Namely Linda.

Debbie Harding scowled as the name ran through her mind. She was so 
angry with the English Teacher, but yet these damn feelings still stood 
in the way. Not that anyone could actually blame her. Linda Blake wasn&#146;t 
your average woman. Gorgeousness and personality rarely went hand in 
hand with women of today&#146;s society.  And that child-like heart of hers, 
difficult as it made things, made Linda all the more wonderful to be 
with. Probably why she connected so well with the students. Debbie 
sighed and tried to get her thoughts together. The buxom beauty tugged 
some of her hair behind her ear, smoothed out her skirt and kept her 
thoughts under control. After a few minutes, Debbie was back to looking 
like her usual, gorgeous and composed self, though truthfully, her mind 
could not stop spinning with the anger and caring she felt for Linda. 

&quot;Blast.&quot; Debbie mused. &quot;If there really is a God, why did he curse us 
all by creating love?&quot;

**********

Linda tapped on her desk irritably. As soon as Debbie left, she should 
have ran after her, and put a stop to all this madness. After all, it 
wasn&#146;t that big of a deal, right? Linda just wasn&#146;t ready to commit to 
anyone, not even sweet &#145;lil Debbie. She couldn&#146;t understand why she had 
reacted the way she did. She was always such a composed and restrained 
woman. One little disagreement and it all blew out the window. 

The worst thing about it was, Debbie had probably broken up with her. 
That in itself was ridiculous. They had a great relationship; they had 
so much in common, not least of which, a passion for teaching. Things 
were going great between them, why did this commitment issue have to 
spoil everything?

&quot;Hard headed.&quot; Linda said privately, grumbling at her desk as some of 
the students began marching into her classroom. &quot;So damn hard headed.&quot;

One of the students was curious about why their teacher was talking to 
herself. 

&quot;Miss Blake?&quot; She said. &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

Linda looked up. &quot;Huh? Oh, sorry Jackie. Just give me a couple seconds 
to get my head together. I&#146;ll be okay.&quot;

The student nodded, walking over to her desk. Needless to say it 
bothered the students when they saw their favourite teachers going 
through their problems. Linda guessed that these kids just forgot that 
teachers were people too. They had hearts that could get broken just as 
easily as any other could. Hopefully that would not be the case for 
Linda. 

At that point, while all the other students filed in alongside her, 
Cassie Robbins zipped into the classroom with a very private smile on 
her face. To anyone who knew her (it was quite a small number, but 
still) Cassie being excited about English class was a standard issue. It 
was one of the few classes in which she could actually spend time with 
Holly. Of course, she didn&#146;t actually speak to Holly-Raine, or even so 
much as get closer than a desk&#146;s worth of distance to her, but it was 
better than not seeing Holly at all. And although Cassie had cried 
herself to sleep over the girl, she was still so hopelessly in love with 
her. 

Whoever said &#145;love screws you up&#146; really knew what they were talking 
about. Cassie took a seat on the desk right behind Holly&#146;s, second 
furthest from the back, against the window. She knew for a fact that 
Holly always sat at the desk in front of Cassie&#145;s own. Another one of 
the Texan&#146;s cute little quirks that Cassie was willing to die for. 

The moment she sat, Cassie took out her books and her little notepad. 
She had found that sometimes, when she was sitting behind Holly-Raine 
during class, she would often be inspired to write brief poems about 
her. It didn&#146;t happen everyday, but Cassie liked doing it, maybe because 
made her feel a little bit closer to Holly, by writing such things when 
she was actually in the room. And although she had mistakenly brought 
her &#145;Shannon&#146; notebook to school with her today, it didn&#146;t stop Cassie 
from writing in it.

Holly-Raine was a popular girl in school, even though you wouldn&#146;t 
really classify her as a &#145;trendy&#146; or a prissy-girl. It was hard to 
simply get any closer to her. Not only that, but Holly stuck to her two 
friends, Summer and Jenny, like glue. No matter how much she would have 
wanted to, Cassie couldn&#146;t break into that inner circle the three of 
them had formed.
 
It was then that our heroine, the sexiest teen in Victoria, came into 
the room. Holly-Raine. Cassie felt her heart clam up, and tried her 
hardest to keep calm. Even though she had seen Holly just the other day, 
it felt like months since they had last come across each other. As 
usual, the cheerful girl barely even noticed her, just took a seat, 
waving to Jenny at the other side of the room and waited for the class 
to begin.

&#145;Holly.&#146; Cassie thought with desire. &#145;Why can&#146;t you notice me?&#146;

Cassie didn&#146;t have much more time to think of a reason. Miss Blake stood 
up and began the class, with a slightly irritable look on her face. 
&quot;Okay, lets get started, class. As you can see, I&#146;m not in the best of 
moods today.&quot;

&quot;Why miss?&quot; One of the girls called out.

Miss Blake smiled grimly. &quot;Lets call it a disagreement. Anyway, I know 
I&#146;m not in a great mood but it don&#146;t want to spoil this lesson for you 
guys. So we&#146;ll take this up to the library, I&#146;ve booked about an hour up 
there for the whole class. As soon as I collect all your book reports.&quot;
                                
Cassie watched Holly-Raine squirm in her seat. She knew that Holly 
probably hadn&#146;t gotten halfway through the thing. Cassie had offered to 
help Holly with it the other day, but as usual, Holly-Raine was so far 
into herself that she didn&#146;t hear a word Cassie said to her. Of course, 
had they actually of worked together, Cassie&#146;s focus would not be on the 
book report itself. The blonde imagined herself slipping in and out of 
delirious daydreams about the brunette, just managing to keep calm in 
the short few instances between them. 

Miss Blake walked around the room in a clockwise rotation, collecting 
the book reports from each student at their respective desks. Eventually 
she came around and reached Cassie&#146;s desk, looking down at the younger 
girl, whose attention was elsewhere. 

&quot;Cassie.&quot; Miss Blake said. 

Cassie said nothing, just looked on in front of her. Miss Blake followed 
the stare, and realized that the younger blonde was staring at the girl 
in front, the tense Holly-Raine. For the first time since this morning, 
Miss Blake smiled a genuine smile to herself. She remembered what it was 
like to have a head-over-heels crush on one of the popular girls. 

Miss Blake coughed into her fist. &quot;Um... Cassie?&quot;

That was the ticket. Cassie looked up at the teacher. &quot;Huh? Miss Blake?&quot;

&quot;Your book report, honey.&quot;  She said, trying hard not to draw any 
attention to Cassie and embarrass her any further. 

Cassie nodded quickly and handed the book report over. It was on a Jane 
Austin novel she had taken out from the local library, and quite a thick 
book actually. This was reflected in the report, which was pretty thick 
itself. Miss Blake took the report and added it to the others, but 
before she moved on, she lowered her knees a bit and whispered into 
Cassie&#146;s ear. 

&quot;Don&#146;t give up.&quot;

Cassie&#146;s eyes widened. Did... did Miss Blake know something? Was it that 
obvious? Cassie looked up at the teacher for some explanation, but the 
educator kept her face blank and unreadable. Cassie just tried to calm 
herself. Maybe Miss Blake was talking about something else. That had to 
be it. The young blonde just watched as Miss Blake walked over to 
Holly&#146;s desk, and smiled as Holly struggled to explain herself.

&quot;I know that face.&quot; Miss Blake said mock chidingly. &quot;That&#146;s your 
&#145;sorry-I-didn&#146;t-do-the-report&#146; face, Holly. So have you got an excuse?&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot; Holly-Raine said, fiddling with her hands. &quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot;

Miss Blake sighed. &quot;Well, you know I don&#146;t like doing it, but I&#146;m going 
to have to give you detention. This book report is important, Holly. You 
still need to get it done, as well.&quot;

Holly nodded. &quot;I understand.&quot;

********** 

&quot;Okay, Cassie. This is it. Just keep calm. Just talk to her.&quot;

The bashful blonde steeled herself. Maybe it was kind of foolish to keep 
on chasing after someone that pretty much knew nothing of your 
existence, but Cassie didn&#146;t feel that way. Anyone who&#146;s been in love 
could know that. You do stupid things, you make silly comments. For 
Cassie, it was even harder. But rather than let an ill-fated sadness 
consume her, she was going to go for it. Keep trying, keep struggling. 
In this world, persistence really was the only way to accomplish 
anything. 

Grabbing a tray, sparsely filled with the junky foods of a Texas high 
school, Cassie looked through the crowded tables of the lunchroom. It 
was just like any other day. The tables were segregated to the 
cheerleaders, the trendies, the norms, and the geeks. Unlike the rest of 
the school though, Holly really didn&#146;t have a &#145;classification&#146;. She was 
popular, but not vain, cool but not conceited, and so she sat at her own 
table with her two best friends, Jenny and Summer. After minutes of 
searching with blue eyes behind thick glasses, Cassie located the object 
of her affections.

&quot;Holly...&quot; Cassie whispered breathlessly.

Like usual, Holly-Raine was sitting with Jenny and Summer at their 
respective table at the corner of the room. They were laughing and 
chatting in their usual manner, ignoring nearly everything that was 
going on around them. In some ways, Cassie really was jealous of those 
two. Jenny and Summer were really nice girls, but they had a friendship 
with Holly-Raine that Cassie resented. Maybe it was her feelings 
talking. It&#146;s easy to be jealous of someone when they had something you 
wanted. And even more so Cassie, because she probably needed Holly&#146;s 
attention more than they did. Looking from the outside in was never an 
easy task. 

After confirming her resolve once more, Cassie took in a deep breath and 
began slowly walking over to Holly&#146;s table. At the table itself, Jenny 
and Summer laughed happily about their lessons so far in the day. 

&quot;Miss Blake seemed kinda strange today.&quot; Jenny mused. &quot;And man, she sure 
had a long face, didn&#146;t she? I wonder what&#146;s eating her?&quot;

Summer rolled her eyes. &quot;Boyfriend troubles, most likely. Then again, 
I&#146;ve never even seen her with a guy. But still, who cares? She gave us 
that book report, so, I guess I shouldn&#146;t feel sorry for her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t be mean.&quot; Jenny said playfully. &quot;Miss Blake isn&#146;t that bad. She&#146;s 
not usually crabby. What do you think is bothering her, Holly?&quot;

Both Jenny and Summer turned to look at Holly-Raine. But her gaze didn&#146;t 
meet with theirs. The two girls assumed that she was daydreaming, so 
left her to it and kept talking. But Holly&#146;s attentions weren&#146;t in the 
clouds. And judging by the wetness under her skirt, it was fairly 
obvious that she really was focused on something. Or someone. Her 
emerald eyes were thick with an intent gaze forward, while her lips 
curled into a delectable smile. Holly looked over at the table beside 
hers, a table packed to the seems with cheerleaders. Evidently, one had 
particularly caught her eye. Holly&#146;s attentions were locked onto the 
only brunette of that table.


She didn&#146;t know her name, in fact, Holly had doubted that she had even 
seen her before. But what she did see, she liked. Holly eyed the girl 
from top to bottom. She had tanned skin, of a cute shade. Her long locks 
of luscious hair bounded onto her shoulders in thick tresses, bangs 
obscuring her forehead. High cheekbones, rosy lips, dark smile and a 
pair of gorgeous brown eyes all added up to a girl that had Holly-Raine 
curious and charmed. 

She loved that &#145;sultry Mediterranean look&#146;. It was obvious that that 
girl wasn&#146;t American by birth, even though she spoke perfect English. 
Holly had never dated a girl of European origin, which made the 
cheerleader even more alluring. But, the real hitter, was the signals 
she was receiving from the girl herself. 

Every so often, she would look up from her lunch tray, flutter her eyes 
at Holly, smile shyly, then look away. It didn&#146;t strike Holly as 
flirtation, the girl seemed too quiet for that, but it was a sign of 
interest. And Holly-Raine took that as one hell of a green light. 

Holly waited for the girl to look at her once more, then made her move. 
She slowly put her elbow on the table, then rested her cheek against her 
palm. The teasing beauty fluttered her eyelashes, then winked subtly at 
the girl. The cheerleader across froze with shock, probably not 
realizing that Holly knew she was watching her. But that shock faded 
into charm, as she beamed a shy smile and lowered her eyes. 

&#145;She&#146;s mine.&#146; Holly thought privately. 

Had this room not been so crowded, Holly might have gone further than to 
simply wink, but it was enough. Enough to present a mutual attraction 
and enough to wordlessly say &#145;I will have my tongue inside you soon 
enough&#146;. At last, Holly-Raine looked away from the cheerleader girl and 
turned to her friends.

&quot;Hey Summer, Jenny.&quot;

Both girls looked over to Holly, but Jenny was the one to answer. 
&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Question. You see that girl over there?&quot; Holly nodded to the 
cheerleader she had been flirting with. &quot;What&#146;s her name? Is she new?&quot;

Summer looked over at the gorgeous cheerleader that Holly nodded 
towards. After studying her for a bit, she replied, &quot;Yeah. Her name&#146;s 
Ella. She&#146;s not new though, she&#146;s been coming to Atlantic High for like, 
six months. I hear her pops is really rich, and that she used to live 
with her grandparents in Barcelona.&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot; Jenny said surprised. &quot;She&#146;s Spanish?&quot;

Summer simply nodded. &quot;Yup. She&#146;s in my Math class. She was at that 
party up at Jackie&#146;s house, the one a couple months ago. The guys that 
were there, were swarming all over her. With all the attention she gets, 
the only thing I&#146;m getting is jealous.&quot;

&quot;Ella, huh?&quot; Holly looked back at her. &quot;I gotcha. When&#146;s today&#146;s 
cheerleading practice?&quot;

Jenny thought about it. &quot;Hmm. Right after lunch. Why?&quot;

Holly grinned with &#145;innocent&#146; intent, but kept her naughty and quite 
frankly, one-tracked thoughts to herself. &quot;No reason, you guys. Just 
wanted to know.&quot;

At that moment, the cheerleaders that were sitting by their table, all 
sat up collectively and walked towards the other end of the room. Ella 
was the last to stand, but when she did, she threw a longing glance at 
Holly. Jenny and Summer didn&#146;t notice it, but Holly did. And not only 
did Holly notice it, she could read it like a book. Ella&#146;s smooth face 
practically screamed interest. And it wasn&#146;t like Holly-Raine could just 
ignore that, could she?

As Ella and her fellow cheerleaders stepped out of the lunchroom amid 
giggles and the occasional yell, Holly slapped her fork down on the tray 
and stood up.

&quot;I&#146;ll catch you guys later, okay?&quot;

Jenny and Summer barely said a word to Holly, as she strode off quickly, 
in the same direction that that group of cheerleaders had gone. In her 
haste, she rushed straight past a blonde girl who was just about to say 
hello to her. Holly was metres away before the blonde even had that 
chance. Her head slumped in defeat. As it turns out, that blonde girl 
was little Cassie. 

Jenny noticed Cassie standing across from them with a sad, disconsolate 
look on her face. &quot;Hey, isn&#146;t that Cassie? From Miss Blake&#146;s English 
class?&quot;

Summer confirmed it. &quot;Yup. She looks kinda sad about something. Maybe we 
should invite her over. Hey! Cassie! Over here!&quot;

Cassie looked up from her tray and looked over to the two that were 
calling her, Jenny and Summer. The blonde girl tried not to look back at 
Holly. Maybe she was being too obvious. Maybe things just kept getting 
in the way, maybe...

&#145;Maybe Holly still doesn&#146;t know I exist.&#146; Cassie thought dejectedly. 

With a frown that&#146;d demolish a city with its sadness, Cassie strolled 
over to Summer and Jenny&#146;s table. It&#146;d be rude to turn away now. Cassie 
walked over to the table, her tray in hand, and tried hard not to let 
tears escape her eyes. At least not when someone could see them. Her 
tray came down to the table with a slap, and Cassie slumped into a 
sitting position, next to Jenny.

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Cassie said calmly. 

Both Summer and Jenny noticed the melancholy demeanour that Cassie gave 
off, but Jenny was the one who was most concerned about it. Although she 
really didn&#146;t know Cassie all that well, she never liked seeing people 
unhappy. 

&quot;Something wrong, Cassie?&quot; Jenny asked. 

Cassie lowered her face, looking downward. &quot;I... I can&#146;t say anything.&quot;

&quot;C&#146;mon,&quot; Summer prodded, &quot;You can tell us. Me and Jenny are like a 
problem page. Have issues, will fix, catch my drift? So what&#146;s the deal? 
School? Work? Guys?&quot;

Cassie took note of the last option. &quot;Sort of. There is someone I like. 
Someone who I really, really like, but... that &#145;person&#146; barely even 
notices me. It&#146;s like I&#146;m invisible.&quot;

Summer blinked. Relationship troubles. Cassie did look like the type. It 
was also pretty obvious that she didn&#146;t handle that kind of situation 
well. Of course, Summer didn&#146;t know all the details, so she couldn&#146;t 
guess all the facts. 

&quot;So...&quot; Summer began, &quot;This &#145;guy&#146; doesn&#146;t know anything about you, huh?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Hmm... I uh... don&#146;t think I can help you on that one. But, I can give 
you something else. See, I&#146;m having a birthday party at my house next 
week. A lot of the girls from Atlantic high will be there, and some guys 
that we know, too. Plus, my folks are out of town so we can be as wild 
as we like! Why don&#146;t you come around? It&#146;s next Friday, it starts at 
9.00 and it&#145;ll end when we&#145;re all hammered.&quot;

Cassie blinked, looking away from her tray and over to Summer. &quot;You want 
me to come to your birthday party?&quot;

Summer shrugged. &quot;Why the hell not? You might as well come. Damn near 
everybody else is.&quot;

Cassie was dumbstruck. She had never been invited to a party by anyone 
before. Most of the girls in this school placed her in the &#145;geek&#146; list, 
and pretty much avoided her. In fact, Cassie was happy when the girls 
ignored her. At times they would do worse. The young blonde remembered 
with some horror, last year&#146;s cross-country run. The Gym class had been 
taken to a huge green field on the outskirts of Victoria, and were made 
to run for some *long* miles. Cassie had been excited at first, until 
that bitch, Shannon Marson (A/N see Misadventures of Anna, chapter 
three) pulled a prank on her. While Cassie was out running her race, 
Shannon and some of her cohorts went into Cassie&#146;s belongings and took 
her school clothes. By the time Cassie finished running the race and 
returned with the rest of the class, her clothes were in ripped into 
shreds and tossed in the mud. The ride home was a nightmare. Cassie had 
to wear her sports clothes back to her house, surrounded by giggles and 
jeers. But the majority of the laughter was reserved for Shannon. 

Though she had no actual proof, Cassie was convinced that Shannon had 
done it. Shannon seemed to have this grudge against her, for some 
reason. And events like that were run of the mill. Cassie was almost 
being bullied by those &#145;trendy&#146; girls. Which was why it shocked her that 
Summer invited her to the birthday bash. Though Summer, Jenny and 
Holly-Raine were not part of Shannon&#146;s group, they were, more or less, a 
part of the &#145;in&#146; crowd. 

Cassie didn&#146;t know what to say, except, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

**********

&quot;We&#146;ve got spirit! Can you hear it? We&#146;ll soar to the sky! We&#146;re 
Atlantic High! Whoo!&quot; 

Holly smiled sweetly as she watched the cheerleading team go at it. 
There really was nothing more satisfying than catching the odd flash of 
a thigh and bounce of a breast during one of their practice sessions. It 
helped pass the time for some, it pretty much thrilled others. For 
Holly, it was like heaven. Six girls, all gorgeous, all eager and all 
dedicated, training for their next display. The baseball team of 
Atlantic High was going up against the team from a neighbouring school, 
called Saffron-Jameson High.  

It was pretty unusual for an all girl&#146;s school to have a cheerleading 
squad, especially a school in Texas. But these days it was all about 
female empowerment, and plus, the student body itself had elected for a 
cheerleading squad. And needless to say, Holly-Raine was glad for that 
choice. She and the cheerleading squad were over in the Gym block, in 
the Gym usually reserved for Basketball. During the second half of the 
lunch period every Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, it was reserved for the 
cheerleaders. Only Holly and a few others actually took the time to come 
and watch. They all sat on the indoor bleachers, watching the feint pep 
rally take place. Though some girls came for tips and hints (being that 
they were hoping to be picked for the squad next year) Holly had just 
come for a show. 

And one hell of a show is what she got.

At the most, Holly was happy to see the whole team bouncing up and down 
in those cute little skin tight leotards, but her focus was aimed at 
only one member of the team. Ella. 

&quot;God, she&#146;s hot,&quot; Holly whispered to herself lustfully. &quot;And I know she 
likes me.&quot;

And it was true. From straightforward body language, you could see that 
it was true. Ella often cast a glance over in Holly&#146;s direction, a 
bashful smile on her face and a bright red blush colouring her cheeks. 
When it came to pulling off a particularly complicated move, Ella would 
look away, do it, then look back at Holly with a face that said, &#145;do you 
like what I just did?&#146;.

To that, Holly replied with a smile that said &#145;Uh huh, I like what I 
see&#146;. Which elicited a smile of flattery from the dark haired girl. 
Holly-Raine remained at that Gym for the entirety of that practice 
session, and continued her subtle flirtation with Ella. She had even 
gone so far as to &#145;drop something&#146; then bend over to collect it. Though 
this gave not only Ella, but the whole cheerleading squad, the chance to 
see her butt, she really didn&#146;t care much. Holly-Raine had been 
comfortable with her body for as long as she could imagine. And she 
didn&#146;t mind the odd audience here and there. 

By the time the squad had finished with their practice shot, Holly was 
convinced that Ella was interested in her. The longing looks and blushes 
were such a big giveaway. The girls from the team split up, some walking 
over to bleachers to get a drink, others crashing on the ground from 
exhaustion. Ella on the other hand, walked over toward the changing 
rooms, on her own. Holly-Raine projected a smile that&#146;d melt ice, then 
ambled down the stands to catch up with her. The brown-haired girl made 
her way downwards, then skipped past the cheerleading squad and followed 
Ella&#146;s path into the locker room, just a couple minutes later. She 
pushed both double revolving doors open, slipped in, and scanned the 
room. Ella wasn&#146;t there. By one of the benches, her pom-poms were rested 
and her gym bag open, but other than that there was no sign of her. 

Holly then noticed the trail of the cheerleader outfit she had been 
wearing. It was laying on the ground in a trail, piece-by-piece, that 
led around the back of the lockers. The trail continued to a set of 
showers, separated from the locker room by a wall. Holly walked around 
that wall, and peered behind it, casting a gaze at what lay there. The 
image made her shiver. 

It was Ella, or at least her silhouette, completely naked, showering 
behind the steamy glass of the shower panel. She was quite the little 
sight to behold. Ella hummed a sweet song to herself while running her 
wet hands through her even more damp black hair. Steam rose up around 
her thighs and waist, while beads of water clung to that sexy flesh of 
hers. The combined sound of Ella&#146;s humming and the frequent chipping of 
the hot shower water drove Holly wild. Maybe influencing her decisions a 
little. 

Well, when a libido needed quenching...

Holly giggled softly, as not to disturb Ella, then dropped her hands to 
her waist. They crossed over the bottom of her shirt, got a grip, and 
then she pulled it up over her head. It fell to the ground. Holly-Raine 
then went for her bra, curling both arms around and unhooking its light 
metal clasp. That fell on its own, just a short distance from the blue 
shirt, revealing her small, gorgeously-crafted breasts, her pink nipples 
swelling with hardness. Next to come was the little mini-skirt that 
clung to her waist and upper thighs. Holly worked swiftly, shooting her 
thumbs into both the skirt and the black panties that were underneath. 
Both articles of clothing went down with her hands. The last things were 
her shoes and socks, which she removed effortlessly. Holly-Raine smiled 
with glee. Stark naked was the code of dress that suited her best. Her 
thin and youthful body stepped forwards slowly, for the most part, 
ignoring the coldness of the room. In a smooth motion, she shifted the 
glass door of the pane open. Ella gasped with a yelp, ceasing her 
humming, her wide dark eyes swishing over to the glass door. It was 
Holly-Raine who she saw, with a confident smile on her face. Ella looked 
downwards, but couldn&#146;t help tossing a couple looks Holly&#146;s way. She 
seemed so calm and unashamed of her nakedness, especially with Ella in 
there with her. 

Holly&#146;s hand went for the four-pointed tap that control the flow of 
water for her shower stall. She turned it to the left, and a downpour of 
warming hot water showered her body, hazing a nubile teen body. Steam 
started to surround her in the same way it was surrounding Ella, and 
Holly confirmed her approval. With a moan.

&quot;Ooh...&quot; She cooed, turning her head softly to Ella. &quot;I just love a hot 
shower. Don&#146;t you?&quot;

Ella blinked, her face prominent with a blush. &quot;...I...&quot;

&quot;I love the way the water feels... when it touches my body...&quot;

Holly-Raine closed those magnificent emerald eyes of hers, then slowly 
worked her fingers through her damp auburn hair. This was done slowly 
and deliberately, dragging long fingers  downwards until the were free 
from the tips of her hair. Holly-Raine jerked her head easily, tossing 
her damp hair from one side to the other, flicking drips of water away 
and forth. Ella watched like a girl in a trance, taking note of Holly&#146;s 
every action, not even stopping to actually shower herself. 

Holly spoke again. &quot;First... over my breasts...&quot;

The young woman took idle time with her seduction. Though she couldn&#146;t 
have been anymore obvious, she couldn&#146;t have been any hotter, either. 
Holly-Raine&#146;s small hands came down her throat and curved over both of 
her taut mounds. She cupped them, like an evaluation, slowly making them 
rise and fall with such a sweet way. Both her middle and wedding-ring 
fingers plucked at her stiff nipples. Holly moaned again, more for 
Ella&#146;s benefit rather than an expression of her own arousal. She rolled 
both of her pinkish nubs between her fingers, and slowly moved her body 
a little. Her tight butt cheeks clenched and unclenched, as the shower 
water ran down her curves. 

&quot;...And then my waist...&quot;

Holly&#146;s right hand remained where it was, kneading her right breast. Her 
left hand vacated from its respective mound, then moved downwards, 
moving evenly over her flat midriff. She moved her around in small 
circles. Holly&#146;s full lips parted again, but gave another moan, this 
time a little more vocal, and a teeny bit more heartfelt. Ella continued 
to watch the other girl, her voice silent and her body still. But her 
mind was screaming, her eyes reflecting the kind of longing that you 
would expect in this situation. You&#146;d be surprised at how amazing a 
beautiful teen can look when drips of water coolly run down the cleft 
between her breasts. 

Okay, maybe it wasn&#146;t that surprising...

Holly continued. &quot;But... what I love the most, is when the water runs 
down my chest and waist, towards my... ooh...&quot;

The hand at her waist moved further south, towards the source of her 
pride. The curve of her darkest and most sensitive region. Holly&#146;s left 
hand curled around it, and she juddered from that simple touch, rolling 
her head backwards. The tips of her brown, shoulder long hair touched 
her back while doing so. Holly continued to rub her hand, fixing it over 
and over in swift strokes, between her moist clenched thighs. While 
rubbing her hairless crotch, her middle finger slipped between the thin 
folds of her soft labia. It moved back and forth, back and forth, its 
gliding far easier due to the moisture provided by the downpour of hot 
shower water. Holly worked her lower set of lips with the skill of a 
seasoned sexual veteran, while the slender fingers of her right hand 
manipulated her firm nipple. She opened her eyes slowly, then looked 
back over at Ella. Who was still as a statue. But her eyes said it all. 
And from that expression, Holly-Raine knew, implicitly, that she had her 
girl. 

&quot;You like showers too, right?&quot; Holly&#146;s voice was now much slower, less 
playful and more sensual, striking deep tones that touched Ella&#146;s heart, 
as well as her youthful loins. Holly kept her hands where they were, at 
the edge of her womanhood and over her breast, and looked down at the 
area between Ella&#146;s own thighs. Her thin, lowly grown layer of black 
pubic hair was dampened, but also sticky. A clear sign of mixture 
between warm water and discharge. And from the looks of it, Ella had 
been leaking a lot. 

Somehow Ella managed to find her voice. &quot;...Uh huh...&quot;

&quot;I thought so.&quot; Holly said quietly. &quot;...Let me help you out there.&quot;

Nonchalantly, Holly-Raine removed her hands from their positions. Her 
dainty wet feet stepped from the tiles of her shower and into Ella&#146;s. 
Holly came to stand behind her, closely, so closely that she could hear 
Ella&#146;s subtle breathing. But the closer Holly got, the less subtle 
Ella&#146;s breathing became. Holly-Raine loved that sound. It was the sound 
of a woman who was gravely nervous, but damn well sure of what she 
wanted. Breaking in the frigid was a guilt-ridden pleasure of our 
heroine. They tended to scream, moan and writhe more, as they 
experienced the many pleasures that a woman can offer another woman. 

But while Ella breathed in and out hard, Holly took the time to fully 
appreciate Ella&#146;s dampened torso. She was looking from behind, so really 
couldn&#146;t weigh everything in her mental scale, but what Holly did see, 
she loved. The divine tan-lines around Ella&#146;s chest and thighs for 
example. Holly-Raine would not have pictured Ella as the type of girl 
who would wear bikinis, but these tan-line indicated that she did. The 
smooth, arching back of hers was another turn-on for Miss Johnson. The 
way the beads of water slid down her neck, and down to the small of her 
back was amazing. But what Holly loved most about the girl was her ass. 
Ella&#146;s sweet, heart-shaped ass. Small, tight and rounded, much like 
Holly&#146;s own, but in her opinion, far cuter. 

But she wasn&#146;t finished yet. Holly had to put the finishing touches on 
this. The young girl&#146;s arm sharked over to a shelf on the wall, not 
moving from behind Ella. She snagged the sponge that was (conveniently) 
there, and cast her attention to Ella&#146;s back. Holly leaned in and 
brought her lips to the Mediterranean girl&#146;s ear, pulling back her 
tresses of dark black hair. 

&quot;I loved your performance today...&quot; Holly whispered alluringly. &quot;You&#146;re 
so much better than the rest of the girls on the cheerleading team. I 
loved the way you moved... it was like you were doing it just for me...&quot;

Ella froze as the wet sponge touched the back of her shoulders. Holly 
slid it downwards, in one go, running it all the way to her cute little 
bottom. Holly repeated this, while continuing to whisper more words of 
praise about Ella&#146;s performance. In minutes, the girl was loose and 
pliable, like literal putty in Holly-Raine&#146;s ample hands. The sponge 
slid down Ella&#146;s back one last time, ceasing at the ass. Just as she was 
about to question why, Holly&#146;s lips answered the question. Ella sighed 
as Holly leaned around and softly placed her lips on the side of her 
neck. They were light butterfly kisses, one after the other, up and 
down. Ella titled her head in the opposite direction, allowing Holly 
better access. Holly kissed and sucked on the damp flesh of the 
cheerleader, occasionally running her tongue upwards. Once it reached 
Ella&#146;s ear, Holly withdrew the tongue and replaced it with her teeth, 
nibbling on her delightful earlobe. 

While her lips continued to play, Holly dropped the sponge. She had a 
far better use for her hands. Both of them touched Ella at the waist, 
then ran upward, along her sides and up to her chest. Skilled hands 
instantly claimed tender, vulnerable breasts. A gasp escaped from Ella&#146;s 
throat, as both of her mounds were seized by both of Holly&#146;s hands. The 
brown-haired angel began a firm by tender caress of them, moving in 
circular motions. Ella&#146;s eyes gripped closed, while Holly-Raine began a 
manipulation of her rounded chest. Ella&#146;s tanned skin was getting hotter 
and hotter, so when Holly&#146;s cool hands touched them, it only added to 
the waves of pleasure she was already receiving. Ella&#146;s head lulled 
back, even while Holly&#146;s mouth nibbled on her neck, leaving behind a 
trail of lovebites. 

Holly grinned at Ella&#146;s long, extended and physical moans, and dragged 
her tongue to the back of her neck. Holly&#146;s fingers began teasing and 
playing with the Spanish girl&#146;s dark nipples, tugging delicately at 
them, her fingertips acting like tweezers. Ella let out more light 
moans, her eyes tightly shut and her damp, clinging hair moving from one 
side to the other. 

Holly-Raine was now so close to Ella that their bodies clung together. 
Holly&#146;s small breasts poked at Ella&#146;s back, being pressed down between 
their presences. Her waist was up against the small of Ella&#146;s back, and 
her thighs were smothering Ella&#146;s behind. The green-eyed girl loved 
their connection. But that wasn&#146;t all that she wanted. Holly&#146;s hand 
finally releases Ella&#146;s right nub, then came up to her mouth. 

Holly held her index and middle fingers before Ella&#146;s lips. &quot;Open your 
mouth, sweetheart.&quot;

The cheerleading Spaniard didn&#146;t even bother to ask why. She simply did 
as she was told, and parted her lips for Holly. The Texan teen acted 
accordingly, slowly putting both of her fingers into Ella&#146;s mouth, past 
her lips, up to the second knuckle joint. Ella instantly began sucking 
on them, her eyes still closed. Her tongue flicked around the tips and 
nails of Holly&#146;s two fingers, bathing them in her warm saliva. Holly 
grinned as Ella set to work on her fingers. Again, she did not even have 
to ask her. Ella just took the initiative. And Ella seemed to know what 
she was doing. Not one tooth was felt, the roof of the mouth was 
avoided. Holly-Raine was pretty sure this was Ella&#146;s first sexual 
experience, do to the reaction she gave before, but Ella certainly 
learned fast. 

Holly still played with Ella&#146;s nipple with her other hand, while her 
lips went back to the cheerleader&#146;s neck and shoulder. All the while, 
her two fingers were nursed on by the dark-haired girl. By the time 
Holly-Raine withdrew her fingers from Ella&#146;s mouth, they were slick with 
her oral juices.  Holly stopped kissing her neck, and whispered into her 
ear. 

&quot;Good girl.&quot;

Holly-Raine subsequently pulled back from her. Ella simply complied as 
Holly motioned for her to lean on the wall of the shower stall. She did 
just that, and following this, Holly leaned  down a little, just enough 
so that her arm could reach Ella&#146;s most delicate area. Holly then asked 
her to spread her legs and arch her back a little, which Ella did. Holly 
took the two fingers that had been in her Ella&#146;s mouth, and placed them 
in her own. After sucking her fingers for a moment, she pulled them out 
and brought that hand down to Ella&#146;s labia, from behind. It moved up and 
down the two fine lips, sliding to and fro. Then Holly parted both lips, 
and ran her middle fingers over the opening to her vagina, purposely 
avoiding her clit. 

It was then that Holly realized, 

&quot;She isn&#146;t a virgin.&quot; She thought curiously. 

Holly looked over at the tense Ella&#146;s head. &quot;Have you ever done this 
before?&quot;

&quot;...Once...&quot; Ella could barely speak. &quot;...W-With Shannon...&quot;

Wow. Holly blinked with confusion. Shannon was into girls. She would 
have never guessed that. And here she was thinking that she was Ella&#146;s 
first. Oh well, at least this made things more interesting. Holly was 
cautious about the so called, &#145;popping of cherries&#146;. Whenever she came 
to virginal girls, she always offered oral. It seemed strange for 
someone like Holly (who had such a rampant sex-drive) to be concerned 
about  people &#145;saving themselves&#146; for things like that, but she did 
believe that the person who should break the hymen should be someone 
they loved. It was a little quirk of hers. 

Regardless, Holly-Raine lowered herself to Ella&#146;s back, and kissed it. 
She dragged her tongue down Ella&#146;s back, and at the same time, 
positioning her fingers at her opening. Ella tightened and screamed with 
bliss as Holly-Raine&#146;s two moist fingers thrust straight up into her 
pussy.  

&quot;Aaaah!&quot; 

Warm, slick and juicy flesh clamped down around Holly&#146;s two fingers, 
while Ella braced herself against the wall of the shower stall. Ella was 
really wet from the inside. And Holly loved it. The sign of true 
arousal. The standing teen pressed her hand to Ella&#146;s back, ever so 
softly, then began thrusting in and out. Ella&#146;s face distorted into many 
visages of pleasure and longing, her eyebrows arching, her mouth 
opening, eyelids fluttering and her cheeks flowering with rosy red. 
Holly&#146;s lips curled into a smile, while her hand darted in and out of 
Ella&#146;s tight vaginal opening. Her hand glided with great speed, due to 
Ella&#146;s internal moisture, which further served to thrill the star 
cheerleader. Her toes curled on the wet panels of the floor, her 
heartbeat grew wildly, and her mouth blasted throaty gasps and sighs. 
Those sweet thighs soon started bucking against Holly&#146;s intrusive 
fingers, desperate to get them as deep inside herself as possible. Soon 
Holly&#146;s fervent thrusts began to work in synchronization with Ella&#146;s 
bounding hips, sliding from the tips of her fingers to the base of her 
knuckles. Ella shrieked and cried. It didn&#146;t even occur to her that the 
other girls might be entering the changing rooms soon. All this 
cheerleader was focused on were Holly&#146;s phallic plunging, and how good 
it felt. It was nowhere near this good with Shannon.  

While Ella continued to cry out and writhe, Holly-Raine turned some 
attention on herself. She took her free hand, and coiled it around her 
own honey pot. She separated both of her lower lips, then plunged her 
middle and wedding ring fingers inside herself. Holly sighed and moaned, 
yet continued to impale Ella, both girls receiving something that could 
be eternally enjoyed. The sounds of that shower stall were unmistakably 
erotic. The ecstatic screams of two young women, experiencing Sapphic 
delight, the plish-plash of the running shower water hitting the tiled 
floor and the fleshy sound of two bodies feeding off each other. The 
scene was enough to drive anyone crazy. It went on for minutes. Holly 
shot her hand deeper inside herself, and heaved a broken sigh, as she 
hit her climax. The subsequent force of her own release caused 
Holly-Raine to spasm violently, and her fingers drove right up Ella, 
harder than ever. Ella bellowed, and her own dam burst. The beauteous 
cheerleader was thrown into the clutches of a powerful orgasm, her inner 
muscles clamping on Holly&#146;s hand. Those hips of hers continued to hump 
Holly&#146;s loosening hand, until she had ridden down the brunt of her 
climax. She came back to earth slowly, her breath loosing its quickness, 
the twitching of her ass following that same path. Ella gave a longing, 
fulfilled sigh as Holly&#146;s hand exited her pussy, covered in her sticky 
yet somehow smooth cum. 

Ella slumped to the floor of the shower, her body and heart spent. Holly 
still stood, with a satisfied smile on her own face. She took the two 
fingers that had been inside of Ella, and tasted her sexual makings. 
Absolutely superb. Holly then looked down at her. The Spanish girl was 
asleep. Probably tired, after her encounter with Holly-Raine *and* 
cheerleading practice. Holly gently pulled the soaked strands of Ella&#146;s 
hair to one side of her face, and stroked her cheek. Soon after, she 
turned off both shower taps, and went back into the changing rooms. 
Holly grabbed a towel belonging to one of the other girls, dried herself 
off, then got dressed. Before she left, Holly dropped a paper containing 
her phone number into Ella&#146;s sports bag. 

She had a feeling she&#146;d be watching cheerleading practice again next 
week.

Chris Angel says,

- The &#39;Ella&#39; request was from silverhat (thanks!) but the 
shower-seduction thing was my idea. Now was that hot, or was that hot! 
^_^ 

- I liked that shower scene, quite a bit. It shows off Holly&#146;s seductive 
powers, y&#146;know? 

- As always, if you have any comments, mail me about them! I&#146;d be glad 
to read &#146;um.
