<a href="../original/angelgift-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        &quot;I hate to impose on anyone,&quot; Roma said softly to the group at 
large, &quot;but Marilyn and I have nowhere to go.&quot; She silvery android 
smiled slightly as she looked at Jenna and asked, &quot;Would you object to 
us staying with you, Princess Jenna?&quot;

        &quot;Of course I object,&quot; Milly suddenly popped up from nowhere, 
the fur on her ears and tail standing on end once again. &quot;As soon as 
you two get your ship fixed you&#39;ll try to take Jenna away from us,&quot; 
the redhead growled.

        &quot;Milly,&quot; Jenna put her hand gently on the catgirl&#39;s shoulder.

        &quot;Can they repair their ship here?&quot; Kat asked them pointedly.

        Roma sighed, &quot;Not with the materials available here, no.&quot;

        &quot;Whaa! We&#39;re stranded,&quot; Marilyn started crying again.

        &quot;Please, don&#39;t cry,&quot; Allison said, patting the blue haired 
girl gently on the shoulder.

        &quot;Of course you can stay with us,&quot; Jenna beamed at the two 
happily, her long black hair curling down her back.

        Marilyn stopped in mid-sob to say, &quot;We can? Oh, thank you!&quot; 
Instead of hugging Jenna, she happily threw her arms around the 
startled Allison.

        &quot;Hey, wait a minute,&quot; Allison started.

        Milly bodily pulled Marilyn off the sandy haired girl, &quot;Hands 
off the princess&#39; fiancee!&quot;

        A smiling Kat shook her head, her long brown hair flowing 
around her face, &quot;You are in so much trouble, Allison.&quot;

        Milly and Marilyn were standing in the middle of the bookstore 
glaring at each other, Jenna had latched on to Allison again, Roma had 
a pained expression on her face, and Kat looked like she was having a 
great time watching the chaos unfold.

        &quot;You are so right,&quot; Allison murmured softly.

        The leather clad Sharin strode away from the bookstore, an odd 
look on her face. The blonde haired woman shook her head as she 
thought, &#39;Why did I compliment Milly like that?&#39; She scowled, &#39;I don&#39;t 
even like her!&#39;

        &quot;And she certainly doesn&#39;t like me,&quot; Sharin muttered aloud.

        Sharin came around the corner and froze, looking right into 
the barrel of a gun. A very large gun, she quickly noted, that was 
being held by a black haired, boyish young man with a particularly 
irritable expression on his pretty face. Long pants, a shirt with 
straps that tightly bound the chest, and a long overcoat finished the 
look.

        &quot;Where is she?&quot; the voice, however, had a rather feminine lilt 
to it.

        &#39;Do I even need to guess who she&#39;s taking about?&#39; Sharin 
thought, having decided that this was likely a woman. She could use 
her powers to create a shield in about a second or so, but a second 
was all the lady would need to fire.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Sharin answered her aloud. &#39;That&#39;s totally 
honest, as I really don&#39;t know exactly where she is,&#39; she thought 
impishly.

        &quot;You&#39;re a Quester,&quot; the woman said softly, &quot;why aren&#39;t you 
bringing her home yourself?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s a little more complicated than that,&quot; Sharin answered. 
&#39;She obviously knows who I am,&#39; she thought uncomfortably. &quot;Who are 
you?&quot; she finally asked.

        The black haired woman&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly as she quickly 
asked, &quot;Jenna&#39;s bonded with someone here, hasn&#39;t she?&quot;

        Sharin firmly kept her mouth shut. &#39;Allison&#39;s just an innocent 
bystander in this,&#39; she thought, &#39;no need to get her in anymore 
trouble.&#39;

        A slight smile teased the lips of the woman, &quot;You&#39;re loyalty 
does you credit.&quot; The gun was smoothly slid away, &quot;My name is Amara.&quot; 
She turned, walking down the alley with her overcoat fluttering around 
her, &quot;I&#39;ll see you again.&quot;

        The wind picked up, dust blowing into Sharin&#39;s face and 
forcing her to shut her eyes. When she opened them up again, Amara was 
gone. &quot;Just what I need,&quot; the blonde growled to herself softly, &quot;yet 
another complication.&quot;

        Sharin&#39;s body glowed brightly for a moment, then she simply 
faded away.

        A few hours later, Allison locked up the shop after waving 
good-bye to Kat, Jenna still keeping a firm grip around her waist.

        &quot;You two have fun,&quot; Kat smirked.

        Allison rolled her eyes, &quot;Not likely.&quot;

        Not with Milly, Roma and Marilyn coming along as chaperones, 
anyway. &#39;What am I thinking?&#39; Allison blinked, a bit of a blush 
appearing on her cheeks.

        &quot;Are you all right, darling?&quot; Jenna asked sweetly.

        &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Allison blinked, for a moment finding herself lost 
in Jenna&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;They&#39;re certainly cute together,&quot; Roma noted coolly to Milly.

        Marilyn sniffled a bit, &quot;That&#39;s so romantic!&quot;

        Milly wiped at her eyes with a handkerchief, then passed it to 
Marilyn.

        &#39;I am so glad it&#39;s a short walk home,&#39; Allison sighed as they 
headed out.

        Milly paused just before they were about to go in, her hand 
resting on the door handle. Her eyes narrowed slightly, &quot;There&#39;s 
someone in there!&quot; Not pausing a moment, she flung the door open and 
leapt with a bloody cry!

        A female voice gasped, &quot;Ooof!&quot;

        Allison, Jenna and the others rushed inside, to see Milly&#39;s 
tail lashing as she glared down at a mildly pale looking Sharin.

        &quot;Haven&#39;t we done this before?&quot; Sharin managed to smile.

        &quot;Hmph,&quot; Milly bounded to her feet, &quot;don&#39;t sneak into the 
Princess&#39; house!&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sharin sighed, &quot;but we&#39;ve got another problem, 
Princess.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll say you do,&quot; Amara said coolly as she stepped from the 
shadows, startling everyone standing in the room. She raised her gun, 
studying the faces in the room as her gaze passed from Milly to 
Marilyn, Roma, then stopping at Jenna&#39;s.

        &quot;What do you want?&quot; Jenna asked with a great deal of dignity.

        &quot;You to come with me,&quot; Amara answered.

        Allison stepped in front of Jenna, &quot;You&#39;re not taking her 
against her will...&quot; she started, then trailed off as she looked at 
Amara.

        Amara looked equally stunned.

        Finally they both pointed at the other and asked, &quot;What are 
YOU doing here?!&quot;</pre>
