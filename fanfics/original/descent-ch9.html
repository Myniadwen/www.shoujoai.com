<a href="../original/descent-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Descent smiled to herself as she sat in the beautifully 
decorated parlor, quietly explaining what had transpired since she had 
last visited. &quot;At least the priest has stopped shooting at me,&quot; she 
fininshed, her glossy black hair flowing over her bare breasts.

        Nocturne shook her head with a little smile, the brown haired 
vampiress relaxing nude nearby, both of them taking a moment to recover 
from their night of lovemaking. &quot;I&#39;m impressed you could reason with 
her,&quot; she admitted, &quot;though I&#39;m a bit nervous about her staying in 
town.&quot;

        &quot;Sam seems honourable,&quot; Descent said softly, &quot;I don&#39;t think you 
have anything to fear.&quot;

        Nocturne surprised her with a laugh, &quot;I&#39;m not worried about 
that, love.&quot; She smirked, &quot;I know Natasha has a few surprises up her 
sleeve.&quot;

        Descent nodded slightly, considering the formidable servant of 
the two vampires, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t put anything past her, I think..&quot; She 
hesitated for a moment before asking, &quot;How are things between Lisa and 
Dominique?&quot;

        The elegant vampire sighed softly, &quot;It hasn&#39;t changed, I&#39;m sorry 
to say.&quot; Nocturne sipped something red from a glass, &quot;She still takes 
Lisa&#39;s memory away, every morning.&quot;

        &quot;Do you think,&quot; Descent said quietly, &quot;that Lisa could come to 
love her?&quot;

        Nocturne shrugged eloquently. &quot;The one time Dominique freed her 
from her glamor Lisa paniced,&quot; she explained, &quot;and she fears such a 
thing might happen again.&quot;

        &quot;I feel a bit sorry for both of them,&quot; Descent softly admitted, 
&quot;because neither of them wins the way things are now.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean?&quot; Nocturne asked softly.

        &quot;Dominique doesn&#39;t get the deeper love that she wants from 
Lisa,&quot; Descent sighed, &quot;and Lisa never knows how much Dominique cares 
for her.&quot;

        Nocturne rose from her seat, reaching out a pale hand to Descent 
as she said, &quot;It&#39;s something to think about, but there&#39;s nothing we can 
do tonight.&quot; She smiled, eyes lingering over her body, &quot;And I find I&#39;m 
feeling... hungry once again.&quot;

        Descent smiled back, her own eyes studying the vampiress as she 
was tugged to her feet. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to enjoy this,&quot; she purred.

        Nocturne chuckled as they strode over to the bed, &quot;Not as much 
as I will.&quot;

        Hours later dawn was nearly there as Descent reached out to 
strode Nocturne&#39;s hair back from her face. &quot;One of these nights I&#39;df 
like to take you out on a date,&quot; she murmured.

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Nocturne smiled back at her drowsily, her eyes 
closing as she gave in to sleep.

        Descent slipped from the bed, picking up her clothes and 
dressing quickly. Her black leather top was tied across the front with 
laces while the matching pants fit like a second skin. &quot;I&#39;d love to know 
where she get&#39;s these costumes for me,&quot; Descent murmured as she slipped 
from the bedroom.

        &quot;I suspect m&#39;lady special orders them,&quot; the amused voice said 
from right behind her. Descent spun around to see Natasha standing there 
dressed in her maid&#39;s uniform, meeting her eyes with a impish little 
smile. &quot;She gets a great deal of enjoyment going through the various 
catalogs and picking them out,&quot; she added.

        &quot;Don&#39;t startle me like that, Natasha,&quot; Descent said as they 
walked down the hall.

        &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Nocturne didn&#39;t look too repentant. &quot;Did you 
make sure that she was safely abed before you left?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;She was sleeping soundly,&quot; Descent said calmly before softly 
adding, &quot;did you send Lisa home or do I need to...?&quot;

        &quot;I sent her home with our driver,&quot; Natasha explained.

        Descent shook her head with a smile, &quot;I still find it hard to 
get used to all this.&quot;

        &quot;You adapt,&quot; Natasha gave her an amused look.

        Descent snorted softly as they reached the door, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;

        &quot;Be careful,&quot; Natasha said softly as she opened the front door, 
slipping something into Descent&#39;s hand as she added, &quot;m&#39;lady would miss 
you deeply, I think.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Descent agreed, striding off down the street. 
She walked quickly, moving through the warren of alley&#39;s and buildings 
to make her way across town, her mind occupied with her thoughts as she 
intentionally traveled as confusingly as possible.

        It was an odd relationship that Descent had with the vampiress, 
one that they were both adapting to. She and Nocturne had been seeing 
each other for well over a month now, sleeping together every few days 
in the luxurious brownstone then parting with the morning light. They 
played out various senarios together, costumes and identities shifting 
in the bedroom, then they talked about their lives together afterward.

        The envelope crinkled in her pant pocket and Descent sighed 
softly. She continued to receive money from Nocturne, despite her 
insisting that she really didn&#39;t need it. She supposed that Nocturne 
needed to do it but still, she had to put her foot down about it 
eventually.

        &#39;Enough of that,&#39; Descent thought, stretching out her slim body, 
&#39;there&#39;s work to do.&#39; She slipped into an dark alley, gripping the rough 
stone wall with suddenly claw like fingers as she climbed up the wall 
like a cat.

        &quot;It took you long enough,&quot; Sam said crisply, the black clad 
priest looking out over the city, the buildings colored rosy with the 
dawn. Her short brown hair was gently windblown, the white on her 
priest&#39;s collar striking.

        Descent walked over to Sam, her black hair flowing back from the 
gentle breeze. &quot;I doubt I&#39;m late,&quot; she answered dryly. &quot;What did you 
want to see me about?&quot; Descent asked.

        &quot;Diana&#39;s servants have been busy,&quot; Sam looked grim. Quietly she 
spoke about the desecrated church, the tainted body left there as some 
kind of unholy calling card. &quot;I want to find who did this,&quot; her eyes 
narrowed, &quot;and make them pay.&quot;

        &quot;How can I help?&quot; Descent asked directly.

        Sam&#39;s lip&#39;s twitched up in a smile, &quot;Considering that I tried to 
kill you you&#39;re remarkably accomidating.&quot; More seriously she tapped her 
silver cross and said, &quot;I tried to trace whomever did it but they 
covered their tracks too well.&quot;

        Descent looked at her with a slight smile, &quot;We all make 
mistakes. Let&#39;s hit the bars around the city, break some arms and see if 
we can get some information.&quot;

        &quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Sam agreed. She looked over Descent 
thoughtfully and noted, &quot;But you might want to go home and change 
first.&quot;

        Descent looked down at herself and nearly blushed, rwealizing 
that she was still in the leather top and pants. &quot;Turn around,&quot; she 
ordered Sam crisply.

        &quot;Why?&quot; Sam asked, looking confused.

        Descent began to untie her top and Sam spun around, blushing. 
The leather pants slid down, setting them down with the top before she 
stood there nude. She focused her will, her form changing so that she 
wore a simple black bodysuit. &quot;You can look now,&quot; Descent smiled, 
tucking her other clothes under her arm.

        &quot;I still can&#39;t get used to that,&quot; Sam muttered.

        &quot;I&#39;ll still need to drop these off,&quot; Descent nodded to the 
bundle of clothes, &quot;but this should save us some time.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Sam answered, walking to the fire escape ladder that 
lead down to the street. They reached the ground together, Descent 
leaping from the roof top to simply drop down beside her. &quot;So where are 
we going?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Just follow me,&quot; Descent said simply. They weren&#39;t too far from 
the apartment that she was renting, so it only took a few minutes to get 
there. She unlocked the front door and waved Sam inside with a simple, 
&quot;Come on in.&quot;

        &quot;The building&#39;s quite the dive,&quot; Sam noted as she looked around, 
&quot;but in here&#39;s not bad.&quot;

        The apartment was clean if bare, only a dining table, chair and 
couch sitting around. A TV sat on a older stand and sprigs of herbs were 
hund about the room but other than that there wasn&#39;t much. It looked 
like a place you existed in, not lived.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Descent disappeared into the bedroom and set the 
clothes on a dresser before walking back out, &quot;it&#39;s clean annd I&#39;ve made 
it as secure as I was able.&quot;

        Sam took a closer look at the decorative herbs, the insignia 
painted on the walls with water and fragrant oil. &quot;Wards and seals,&quot; she 
realized, &quot;very good.&quot;

        Descent flashed a smile, &quot;I wanted one place, at least, where 
I&#39;m entirely safe.&quot;
