<a href="../original/descent-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        The brown haired woman dressed in black watched the church, her 
expression grave. &#39;It doesn&#39;t make sense,&#39; Sam thought as she looked out 
from the shadows, &#39;it looks like it&#39;s been abandoned for years, not 
days.&#39;

        The church stood on the corner, on the surface looking much like 
it had when Sam had first visited here less than a week ago. But outer 
appearances were deceiving. The aura around the place was oddly 
sinister, the stained glass windows now empty portals, the doors handing 
loose on the hinges. People noticeably detoured around it, some instinct 
telling them to avoid it.

        &quot;Guess I&#39;d better go in,&quot; Sam said grimly. The priest crossed 
the street, pausing in front of the door. In a single smooth motion she 
drew her pistols from beneath her black coat and shouldered the front 
doors open, running in guns raised.

        Inside the neglect was obvious, the church had been vandalized 
badly. The wooden pews leading up to the altar were firewood now, the 
ornate decorations around the church torn down or removed. The altar 
itself was bare, the implements of a priest&#39;s duties all gone. The smell 
of rot filled the stale air, and shit, strong enough to make her eyes 
water.

        &quot;Defiled,&quot; Sam muttered softly, striding down the central 
walkway as she slid one pistol away, the other still held ready.

        There was a deliberate pattern to the damage, a feeling in the 
air of pure corruption. Sam&#39;s trained eyes took in the destruction and 
came to a simple conclusion: someone had intentionally desanctified the 
church. Through acts of deliberate evil they had violated this place, 
forever rendering it unfit for any sort of holy sacrament.

        &#39;On the other hand, unholy ceremonies,&#39; Sam thought to herself 
bleakly, &#39;will be right at home here now.&#39; She reached the desecrated 
altar and fought back a gasp, understanding where the scent of rot had 
been coming from.

        The nun&#39;s body lay sprawled in front of the altar, dressed in an 
erotic parody of a traditional nun&#39;s garb. The black robes were replaced 
with wide leather straps, a few accents of pure white cloth merely 
highlighting the nudity, not hiding it. Short blonde hair curled about 
an oddly innocent looking face, one that Sam recognized.

        &quot;Katherine,&quot; Sam murmured sadly, kneeling down beside her even 
as she crossed herself reflexedly. The young woman had blood on her bare 
thighs, whip cuts across her breasts, it looked like she had been raped 
before she died. &#39;And maybe afterwards,&#39; Sam thought as she reached out 
to close those sightless blue eyes.

        Katherine&#39;s body moved suddenly, grabbing her hand as the scent 
of rot intensified. Sam brought her gun around even as Katherine spoke 
in a raspy voice, &quot;Anyone can fall from grace, Templar, even one like 
this.&quot; The corpse leered up at her as it tried to asked seductively, &quot;Do 
you still find me pretty. Sam?&quot;

        BOOM!

        The mingled scent of incense and gunpowder lingered in the air 
as the now headless rotted body slumped backwards, the bullet having 
splattered it&#39;s remains against the altar. It was as if the normal decay 
had suddenly sped up, the flesh melting from the bones until tattered 
remains of the costume and bare bones lay on the floor.

        Sam slid her gun away and knelt there beside Katherine a moment 
then softly said, &quot;May God have mercy on your soul, amen.&quot;

        The black clad woman rose, standing there for a moment studying 
her surroundings. She turned, striding down the center aisle and right 
out the front door. She looked around, seeing little traffic and no 
pedestrians nearby and pulled a small device from her coat. With an 
underhand throw she cast it into the building then sprinted away as fast 
as she could.

        The initial explosion blew the remaining windows out, then the 
roof partially began to fall in from the structural damage. The thermite 
charge ignited moments later and the remains of the building caught 
flame. The fire roared on for minutes, the heat soaring, then the flames 
eased off, leaving only smoldering ruins in it&#39;s wake.

        Sam crossed herself, eyes dark with memory as she looked at the 
wreckage. &quot;I don&#39;t know who did that to you Katherine,&quot; she finally 
said, &quot;but I am going to find out.&quot; She turned, walking away into an 
alley as she added, &quot;And they&#39;re going to pay.&quot;

        **********

        Across town in an opulent mansion, the loud crack of a whip was 
heard cutting through the near silence, followed by a anguished cry. 
Diana reclined in her seat, almost looking like a queen on a throne as 
the bosomy blonde watched them eagerly, the emblem tattooed into her 
cheek almost glowing in the soft light.

        The maid was expressionless as she drew her arm back, dressed in 
the traditional garb of her profession. The whip hissed through the air, 
the sound of flesh being struck, and she smiled as she heard the painful 
cry, her black hair flowing down her back in a wave.

        &quot;The first set is done, Lady Diana,&quot; the maid turned to say.

        Diana slid from her seat, the silken dress she wore whispering 
as she walked over to the naked young woman secured from the ceiling. 
The slim blonde panted softly, sweat soaking her skin, her back bleeding 
slightly from the first set of whip cuts. Her bottom was rosy from the 
paddle, her thighs having tasted strikes from the rod.

        Diana reached out to draw the woman&#39;s face up, looking into her 
bright green eyes as she said, &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t run, Lina.&quot;

        Lina shuddered slightly, biting back a moan of pain. &quot;I know the 
consequences of failure,&quot; she managed to get out, her breath coming 
faster.

        Diana stroked the cheek, smiling slightly. &quot;Yes, you do,&quot; she 
agreed. She slid her hand down, weighing a breast then grabbing at the 
nipple. &quot;And I know how much of a bottom you are,&quot; she cooed as she 
savagely twisted.

        &quot;Ah!&quot; Lina arched her back, pulling at the stripes taken from 
her back, savoring the pain as she breast was firmly teased.

        Diana leg go, stepping back as Lina slumped, gasping. Clear 
fluid glistened on her thighs, the scent of arousal filling the air. 
Diana turned to the maid, &quot;Finish the whipping.&quot; She turned to walk away 
before adding,. &quot;And you can have her, once you&#39;re done.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you, m&#39;lady,&quot; the maid bowed, looking over at Lina with 
hungry interest.

        Diana left the room, hearing the whip and Lina&#39;s cries of pain 
and pleasure as she walked out into the hallway. She strode down the 
hall, her secretary Grace silently falling into step beside her. &quot;Any 
progress on the Descent situation?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Descent has cut into our operations by 25% so far,&quot; Grace said 
crisply, &quot;we&#39;re working to compensate by channeling our resources into 
activities she hasn&#39;t hit so far.&quot;

        &quot;No,&quot; Diana shook her head, &quot;those are simply things she hasn&#39;t 
gotten to yet.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Grace nodded, the black haired woman making a note on 
her personal organizer.

        &quot;Has it been confirmed that the Templar has allied with 
Descent?&quot; Diana asked as a waifish pretty boy opened the doors to her 
chambers.

        &quot;Not yet,&quot; Grace answered. Diana glared at her but Grace 
remained calm as she continued, &quot;We know that she worked with Descent 
against our smuggling operation, but I&#39;ve had no reports of them working 
together after that.&quot;

        &quot;Understood,&quot; Diana pulled her overcoat off, the revealing silk 
gown she wore beneath it hugging her every generous curve.

        The bedroom was opulent, decorated with the finest furnishings. 
A mini-bar waited to be used on one side, nearby it trays of delicacies 
to be sampled. The floor was covered by the deepest, most comfortable 
carpet, matching the gentle rose that dominated the scene.

        Grace completely ignored the whimpering young woman bound to the 
center of the bed as she said, &quot;We&#39;ve had several private contractors 
express interest in dealing with the situation.&quot;

        &quot;Interesting,&quot; Grace took her dangling earrings off, setting the 
diamond studded jewelry down on an table as she studied the fearful 
girl. &quot;They&#39;ll need demon slaying experience,&quot; she slid glittering 
bracelets off, &quot;and no religious affiliations.&quot;

        &quot;Shall I offer a bounty or subcontract?&quot; Grace asked.

        &quot;A bounty,&quot; Diana smiled coldly as she slipped her high heels 
off, &quot;it tends to encourage competition and speed in these little 
situations.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll see to it,&quot; Grace bowed, waiting to be dismissed. A wave 
of Diana&#39;s hand sent her off and she strode away, her mind fully 
occupied by the task ahead.

        Diana reached up behind her neck, releasing a clasp and letting 
her dress puddle around her feet. The girl would have gasped through her 
gag, taking in those upthrust breasts, the slim waist and the entirely 
unnatural phallus down below.

        &quot;It&#39;s not real,&quot; Diana said conversationally as she climbed up 
on the bed beside the naked girl, &quot;though I had it modeled as 
realistically as possible.&quot; She undid the gag, drawing the damp ball 
from the girl&#39;s mouth.

        &quot;Please....&quot; the girl started.

        Diana cut her off, pressing her mouth to hers. The kiss was 
gentle at first, almost chaste as Diana pressed herself to her, then she 
plunged her tongue home. She grabbed her face, exploring roughly before 
drawing back, nipping roughly at her lips and entirely uncaring that she 
was drawing blood. Diana slid her hand down, stroking the small breasts 
and down to the lightly haired triangle. Fingers slid in carefully then 
she smiled.

        &quot;Virgin road,&quot; Diana cooed in her ear, &quot;just as advertised.&quot; She 
slid into position between the girl&#39;s forcibly spread legs even as she 
continued, &quot;I love deflowering virgins....&quot;</pre>
