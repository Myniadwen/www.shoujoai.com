<h1>Necroknight (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/elkat.html">Elkat</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/necroknight-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a>  <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>Chapter 2: Tigers and Dragons</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <b>B</b>ones sat at 
the desk of her inn room, face flat on the desk top smeared with ink. 
Beside her desk sits a trash bin that was overflowing with crumpled 
balls of paper; the reason she hated writing in ink. She had spent the 
last few days organizing her thoughts and trying to write a report, 
but she would catch one little mistake and too her luck she had no whiteout 
on hand, forcing her to crumple up the page she had been writing on 
and start all over again. Sometimes being detail critical was a real 
pain.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Bones-sensei, 
it&#39;s time to wake up,&quot; Shiko said, gently shaking Bones.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight moaned as 
she picked her ink smeared face off the desk, wiping the sleepiness 
from her baggy eyes. Yawning so deeply that her jaw hurt, she turned 
to look at her squire while rubbing her soar jaw to end up having pick 
it off the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Shiko was wearing nothing 
more than an apron and thigh long socks. Seeing how her master was looking 
at the girl blushed and asked, &quot;Do you like, master.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The knight shook her 
head to clear her mind and looked at her squire again, but still she 
saw the young hunter in the most immodest costume she could imagine. 
Her eyes as large as shields, the knight looked away and rubbed the 
blood that began to trickle from her nose. &quot;Um, Shiko-san, I, um… 
well to say… it&#39;s um, looks good on you… really good… But, um 
we shouldn&#39;t you be wearing something more, um… covering! As soon 
as I finish my report, we&#39;ll be leaving.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Leaving? Where 
are we going?&quot; the hunter asked, looking at her master curiously. 
She began to change.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I have to get 
my nodachi repaired. It originally belonged to my mother and she told 
me when she gave it to me to go to a shop called the &#39;Dragon&#39;s Den&#39;,&quot; 
the knight said, looking back. Seeing the forest elf in the process 
of undressing, she blushed deep red and quickly looked back at her desk. <i>
Ever since she k, kissed me, I&#39;ve been unable to look at her whenever 
she&#39;s, she&#39;s… Damn! The very thought of it makes my blood rush to 
my head!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
&quot;Is something wrong Bones-sensei?&quot; Shiko asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Nah, it&#39;s nothing!&quot; 
Bones said. With a shaking hand she put her ball point pen to paper 
and began to write. <i>The sooner I get this done, the sooner we can 
get out of her here… DAMN IT! </i>
Making a mistake, she tossed her pin aside, crumpled the paper she had 
been writing on and threw it into the trash can.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Um, could you 
need some help?&quot; Shiko asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s okay, I just 
need to focus and…&quot; Bones said, writing on the next page of paper 
only to end up crumpling it up and tossing it into the trash can.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Please Bones-sensei, 
I&#39;m your squire! Let me help you!&quot; the girl said, laying her hands 
on the knight&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;ll scribe for you. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I guess it can&#39;t 
be help,&quot; the knights said, shrugging. &quot;Dear Sir Lord Cadaver, 
I have made contact with a minion of the Hellborn Necromancer and consequentially 
obtained a squire, who at the same time, though the two are separate 
individuals. The minion was a sentient Hellborn Skeleton who had been 
murdering individuals and animating their remains to create a chain 
of murders that could not have easily been tracked back to it. Unfortunately, 
I was forced to destroy it before I could interrogate it about the location 
of its master. As for my squire, she is a Hellborn Genocide survivor 
like myself and is capable of performing Soulpiercing without chanting 
an incantation. This skill alone makes her invaluable to our cause and 
I&#39;m than capable of handling her. I would be honored to have your blessing 
and imbue me with the wisdom needed to teach her as you taught me.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I regress; we 
have investigated the town where the incident has happened and the surrounding 
area to find no immediate signs to suggest that there was any true purpose 
of the Hellborn Skeleton save to create as much chaos and despair as 
possible. I will search for any leads I can find, but I must first repair 
my nodachi which was greatly damaged in my battle with the Hellborn 
Skeleton. Due to the rarity of nodachi, I&#39;m forced to locate a shop 
in Duslan&#39;&#39; called the &#39;Dragon&#39;s Den&#39; whom my mother has told me to 
go when she originally gave it. I will keep you noticed if any new leads 
appear in my journeys. Sincerely, Bones.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The squire scribbled 
what her master dictated with the skill of a master calligrapher, stringing 
the characters gracefully across the page with thoughtful care. Bones 
almost didn&#39;t notice that the girl had cleverly added more into the 
part cornering herself especially their relationship.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Wait! You can&#39;t 
tell him that!&quot; Bones exclaimed her face crimson red.</font> <br>

</p>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Meanwhile...</font></p></ul>
<ul><p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The gathered members 
of the council looked at the carrion crow with unmistakable surprise.</font></p></ul>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Is this true Cadaver?&quot; 
Asked a woman in draped in white cloak and white gown. Her face was 
hidden by the mask like collar of her dress and the shadows of her cloak&#39;s 
hood. The silver crescent moon that fastened her cloak symbolized her 
position as liaison between the Skullguard and the church.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Nev&#39;rmor is honest 
crow and has yet to make any mistakes as of yet. If what he saw is as 
we say, we are to place an investigation team into the area as we speak,&quot; 
Cadaver said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Bones, isn&#39;t she…?&quot; 
the woman asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;She survived a 
hellfire genocide at his hands, but worry not she&#39;s not the type to 
rush off seeking revenge. In fact she is probably writing a report on 
the manner as we speak,&quot; the lord said, shrugging.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  As though cued, a glowing 
pentagram appeared on the dining hall table. Flashing in so brightly 
that the council members were forced to shield their eyes, the pentagram 
disappeared leaving behind a black scroll case with the seal of the 
Skullguard. &quot;Well speak of the devil.&quot; The knight grabbed 
the scroll case and broke the seal. Tossing aside it&#39;s cap, he drew 
a rolled piece of paper. He chuckled to himself and said, &quot;My I 
never knew that she interested in girls like that.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well? What does 
it say?&quot; the woman in white asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Patience, Phantom, 
milady… we have all the time in the world,&quot; said another councilmember. 
Her dark skin which peeked through her veil and calasiris revealed her 
to be a sand elf from the northern desert.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;That&#39;s a little 
hypocritical Mummy, you&#39;re the most impatient of all of five of us,&quot; 
said another council member, dressed in a sailor suit whose shirt left 
her mid-rift exposed. She wore a bandana over her lower face from the 
nose down and an eye patch over right eye. Her tanned skin and aquamarine 
hair marked her as a ocean elf. &quot;Right Carrion?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The last of the five 
council members was draped in wolf pelts that hid his face, leaving 
his identity even more mysterious than Cadaver. He neither replied nor 
showed any signs of paying attention.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Stay out of this 
Ghoul!&quot; Mummy hissed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Bones has confirmed 
Nev&#39;rmor&#39;s report and though by her claims, there are no traces in the 
immediate area of the town of Coton. Further more, it seems she is forced 
to go to Duslan&#39; to get her nodachi repaired… her destination is the 
Dragon&#39;s Den.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Silence descended upon 
the council members.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The Dragon&#39;s Den! 
Isn&#39;t that the heart of the Dragon Clan mafia?&quot; Phantom asked shocked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The same mafia 
that dabbles in about everything illegal?&quot; Mummy asked, confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The same bastards 
that have been slipping under my nose, smuggling contraband into the 
main land and giving me a bad rep!?!&quot; Ghoul added, her eyes flashing 
with anger.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Carrion didn&#39;t ask a 
question, but by the way looked towards Cadaver, he suggested that he 
was just as curious.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes, the very 
crime organization that has used the lawless nature of Duslan&#39; to their 
advantage. Not even we have the jurisdiction to disband them and all 
because they haven&#39;t abused the arts of necromancy in any manner that 
we could act on. They are thorn in the side of this entire continent 
and the surrounding seas and there&#39;s nothing that we can do! However 
this may be in our fortune. Though Bones is a dread elf, her mother 
left her homeland long ago and to my knowledge never told her anything 
about it. In other words, she may just be able to reveal something we 
can&#39;t. Even though she knows little of the Dryad&#39;s Cemetery, she knows 
enough to not foolish wave her badge around and get herself killed or 
worse by it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Worse?&quot; Phantom 
asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;In Duslan&#39;, slavery 
isn&#39;t only allowed, it accounts for a third of its profit the other 
two thirds being narcotics and prostitution with the employees being 
most slaves themselves. In short, if she were be enslaved, she would 
wish she was dead.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;That&#39;s cruel! 
Isn&#39;t the Dryad&#39;s Cemetery in your domain?&quot; Phantom asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes, but I cannot 
leave my castle for my political reasons and if I tried sending someone 
in my place to change the laws, they&#39;d be killed or worse…&quot; Cadaver 
said. &quot;However, like I said she&#39;s not so stupid to get herself 
in such a situation. The only thing that could possibly blow her cover 
is discovering the Hellfire Necromancer or one of his consorts being 
in Duslan&#39;, but what are the chances of that?&quot;</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You&#39;re in a good 
mood,&quot; the cloaked man said, gauging Neco Lee who held a letter 
in her hands. As he had been before, he sat in his throne overlooking 
a chessboard with the rest of the room hidden in darkness.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Neco Long has 
returned to Duslan&#39;&#39; and he says that he has brought back something 
quite exotic! Oh I must see what it is! You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; 
The girl said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Duslan&#39;&#39; eh? I 
hear it&#39;s a haven for criminals. From slavers to necromancers, I hear 
the only law they obey is take what you kill,&quot; the man said, resting 
his chin on his wrist as he leaned forward with his elbows perched on 
one of the throne&#39;s armrests. &quot;Tell me this, is it a coincidence 
you share the same surname?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;We shared a father, 
each of our mothers taught us a different sin. For me it was lust and 
for him greed… Though there&#39;s a funny thing about him. He doesn&#39;t 
take money!&quot; the girl said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Then what does 
he take?&quot; the man asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Services. You 
see we share something common, we both value cute girls!&quot; the girl 
said walking over to one of her lifeless, animate dolls and pinched 
it by the chin.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;He intrigues me… 
I think I&#39;ll send a pawn to scout him out,&quot; the man said, waving 
forward a hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  A cloaked figure stepped 
out of the shadows with a scythe clutched in it&#39;s skeletal hands.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  Clatter, clatter.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The Armatra soared down 
the tracks that determined it&#39;s destination. Bones, Marrow and Shiko 
sat comfortable in a homely passenger car, eating a late morning snack. 
Bones had bought some more caramel cubes and was plopping them into 
her mouth while Shiko nibbled on a double chocolate chip cookie and 
Marrow having wolfed down a loaf of sweet bread.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Um, Bones-sensei?&quot; 

Shiko began, looking up at her master.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes, Shiko-san?&quot; 
Bones asked back.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I know this may 
sound bad, but what is Soulpiercing Silver?&quot; the hunter asked, 
looking at her shamefully.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I expected you 
wouldn&#39;t know. To perform Soulpiercing without an incantation requires 
years of training or natural talent, usually later having no idea what 
it is. I assumed you were the later and there&#39;s no problem with that. 
After all, as my squire, I must teach you everything, but to understand 
Soulpiercing you must first understand how necromancy works. Magic in 
general is fueled by the mana which is born from all living creatures 
and channeled by mages, but mana is incapable of animating the dead. 
Well in actuality you can animate a corpse, but you would have to manually 
control it&#39;s every action and is a really tedious task. I regress; to 
animate a corpse you place a sliver of your own soul into a corpse to 
bring it into semi-automatic animation.&quot; the knight said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Semi-automatic 
animation?&quot; the hunter asked, confused.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well you see animation 
comes in three forms: marionette animation, semi-automatic animation, 
and full automatic animation. Marionette animation is the process of 
giving an inanimate object animation through manual manipulation while 
semi-automatic and full automatic animation do not require constant 
manual manipulation to be animated. The difference between semi-automatic 
and full automatic animation is that semi automatic animation relies 
on some one else to give it orders, but is capable of completing any 
order it is given such as your basic zombie or skeleton where as full 
automatic animation enables the animated object to think and act on 
its own such as liches and vampires. Are you following me so far?&quot; 
the knight asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The hunter stared at 
master with a blank expression on her face. &quot;Uh…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well I guess I 
should simplified it for you. Marionette animation manipulates an object 
like a puppet. Semi-auto animation gives an object to act on orders 
without constant aid on its master side to an extent. Full auto animation 
gives an object free will. Does that help?&quot; The knight asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I think I understand 
now!&quot; Shiko said smiling.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Now as I said 
before for semi-auto animation, you must place a sliver of your own 
soul into a corpse to animate it. Well that sliver of soul can easily 
be cut if somebody were to harness their own spirit with an attack such 
as your arrows or my nodachi. The process of harnessing one&#39;s soul in 
this matter is called Soulpiercing, but it&#39;s difficult to do unarmed 
as you say back in the cemetery. However channeling it into any weapon 
is not easy either. A weapon made from silver of the purist quality 
has the ability to channel one&#39;s soul, hence it&#39;s referred as Soulpiercing 
silver. Of course silver of any quality can be turned into Soulpiercing 
silver, you merely need to purify it with a transmutation spell as I 
did,&quot; the knight said, fingering the remains of her nodachi.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Can&#39;t you have 
it&#39;s blade forged with Soulpiercing Silver?&quot; the girl asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Not necessarily. 
The blade of a nodachi is folded a hundred times to make incredibly 
sharp, but frail in comparison to other swords. Unlike steel that is 
purified from iron, becoming stronger, silver that is purified into 
Soulpiercing silver becomes frailer and wouldn&#39;t survive the forging 
process.&quot;  the knight explained.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Oh, I see…&quot; 
the girl said. &quot;Um, why are riding the Armatra? Couldn&#39;t we just 
pass the border from Coton?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;If you wanted 
to die, yes. The Dryad&#39;s cemetery was once a part of the Gaiose Forest 
until it was cut down in some long forgotten war, killing the dryad&#39;s 
that resigned in the trees. The dryad&#39;s blood soaked into the ground, 
their anguish cursing the entire area turning it into a swamp of unimaginable 
hatred and suffering. Dread elves were said to be born as a race on 
the day the swamp was born. Worse yet, over time many creatures have 
come to call that swamp home and if you aren&#39;t careful, they&#39;ll devour 
you,&quot; the knight said. &quot;Or so my mother told me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Wow, I never knew,&quot; 
the girl said looking out the train&#39;s window at the dark patch of swamp 
just north of them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;In order to make 
passage through the Dryad&#39;s Cemetery safe, the local hunters have taken 
the responsibility of securing a path for public use and everyone traveling 
along it. Of course, nobody&#39;s perfect and there&#39;s still a risk to taking 
this path, but compared to winging it and tackling the swamp blindly, 
it&#39;s more preferred,&quot; Bones said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I agree,&quot; 

the Shiko said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Beep</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
&quot;Arriving at the Dryad Cemetery Border Station. Please gather your 
belongings before leaving. Thank you for riding the Armatra.&quot; Announced 
a prerecorded voice over the intercom.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;We&#39;re almost there, 
better get ready,&quot; Bones said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right,&quot; the 
girl said, collecting her assorted possessions.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  As the trained pulled 
into the station, the trio departed the Armatra and faced the land before 
them. Dark clouds hung over the wetland strewn with the stumps of trees 
that have been cut down cemeteries ago, but appear to have cut down 
just the other day. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;They say the sun 
never shines in the dryad&#39;s cemetery and the clouds only part at night 
to allow the moonlight shine upon the corpses of nature to remind the 
residents the fate of the swamp…&quot; Bones said. Looking over towards 
her squire she asked in concern, &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I can feel it&#39;s 
pain, it&#39;s sorrow! The land cries for an end to its suffering, but it 
can never find any. I cannot forgive whoever would be so selfish to 
do this!&quot; Shiko answered, wiping the tears from her eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry about me, I&#39;ll be fine. I just need to tune it out.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Sensitivity towards 
nature. Not many knights take consider nature to mean anything in the 
arts of necromancy, but death is merely a part of nature; one part we 
tend to deny nature of. Considering the hazards ahead of us, such a 
talent will be a great aid. </i>The knight thought. &quot;Let&#39;s get 
going, I hear things become more dangerous when night falls.&quot; Bones 
grabbed Marrow and carried her in her arms. &quot;And remember, stay 
on the tree stumps!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right!&quot; the 
hunter replied.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The two elves began 
to traverse the swamp, leaping from stump to stump. They had no trouble 
determining where the path laid for every thirty feet, a pair of spears 
were stuck out of a stump on either side with a white ribbon tied to 
each for easy visibility. Every so often the path would fork with signs 
telling where each path lead, forcing the women to stop and read the 
signs to insure they didn&#39;t make a wrong turn and be forced to waste 
time back tracking. By mid day, they had stopped to rest and check a 
map they had picked up at the station. They estimated by the number 
of paths they had crossed, it were half way there.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;We&#39;re so lucky 
that it&#39;s less than a day&#39;s trip away,&quot; Shiko said, unpacking a 
bento lunch she had prepared for the three of them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well Duslan&#39; was 
originally the capital of the entire forest located in the heart of 
the country, but with the wide spread deforestation that lead to the 
swamp&#39;s creation, it became a crucial trade town between the swamp and 
the forest. I&#39;ve also heard it&#39;s the home of several illegal businesses 
that we cannot do anything about it,&quot; Bones said. &quot;Also I&#39;d 
suggest you keep our status and allegiance secret. I don&#39;t want to think 
what would happen to us if the locals were to discover that we were 
law enforcement.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;K,&quot; Shiko 
replied, eating from her bento.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Arf! Arf!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
Marrow, who had left her bento spotless as though she had been left 
to starve was staring at the girls, hoping to get some table scraps.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Sorry girl, but 
we have to build up as much energy as possible,&quot; Bones said between 
shoveling the food into her mouth.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  <i>It&#39;s kind of disturbing 
to watch, but I guess pets do take after their masters… Bones-sempai 
must be famished! </i>The girl thought watching her master with wide 
eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  None were aware of a 
tentacle like vine slithering out from the wet soil and coiling about 
the stump where Shiko was sitting.  Snaking around one of the girl&#39;s 
legs, the vine retracted, jerking the hunter into the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Eek! What&#39;s going 
on?&quot; The hunter tried, grabbing the stump.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Crap!&quot; Bones 
cried. She reached for her nodachi to remember that it was unusable. <i>

I guess nature sensitivity doesn&#39;t really help when you&#39;re 
distracted!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
&quot;Bones-sensei help!&quot; the girl cried, struggling against the 
vine with clear signs of winning.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  More vines rocketed 
from the ground, grabbing the girl everywhere she could and more often 
than not that was somewhere quite peculiar.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No! I&#39;m saving 
myself for Bones! Stop it!&quot; The hunter cried.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Let go of her!&quot; 
Bones yelled grabbing the vines. &quot;(Drain dry, wither in the sun, 
wilt and die)!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The vines began to thrash 
about violently as they began to shrink and writhe, turning an unhealthy 
brown as it fell lifelessly and broke apart.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I was so scared!&quot; 
Shiko cried, wrapping her arms about the knight&#39;s neck.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s okay… be 
better hurry. I don&#39;t know if that would be the last of them,&quot; 

the knight said, rubbing the girl&#39;s back soothingly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;O, okay!&quot; 
The girl said, sniffling.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  By night fall the trio 
had reached Duslan&#39;, but their clothes had seen better days. Anyone 
that would be walking the path after them would find it strewn with 
the bodies of countless creatures they had the misfortune of encountering 
on their journey.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;S, so many tentacles! 
I, I thought that was suppose to be the safest way through,&quot; Shiko 
said, looking anxiously at a nearly empty quiver she remembered filling 
before they had left Coton.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I hate to imagine 
what we would encounter if we had wander off the path,&quot; Bones said, 
panting.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Arf!&quot; Marrow 
barked. She, of the three, was the most untouched mostly because she 
was no more of a threat to the creatures than a nuisance compared to 
the armed elves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well we better 
change our clothes before locating the Dragon&#39;s Den,&quot; Bones said 
looking at her tattered clothes.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;But beside my 
yukata and apron, these are my only clothes,&quot; Shiko said, blushing.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I only have my 
knight uniform… I didn&#39;t expect that we&#39;d be staying long enough to 
have to change clothes. I guess we&#39;ll have to find the nearest clothier,&quot; 
the knight said, sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Neither woman saw the 
shadows that had been watching them and slipped in pace behind them 
at a safe distance as they began to climb the stone stairway that lead 
to the city.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Duslan&#39; was a city built 
above the ground long before the Dryad&#39;s Cemetery came to be. Some might 
argue that it was more of a castle than a city as a high wall encased 
the city, protecting from being raided. Built on a high foundation of 
stone with the only means of accessing it was through the stairs at 
each of it&#39;s four entrances named in respect to their location in the 
city (North, East, South and West). Though there were no guards in sight, 
the women could feel eyes piercing them. Even Marrow was on her guard, 
looking from wall to wall with suspicion. Occasionally the moon&#39;s light 
would reveal that every so many feet there were narrow, vertical holes 
in the walls that framed the stairs; arrow slits.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Be on your guard, 
but don&#39;t brandish any weapons,&quot; the knight said softly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Roger,&quot; Shiko 
replied.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The stairs leveled out 
onto a rather empty street. Occasionally a cloaked figure would skulk 
from one alley into another as the trio walked down the dark, unlit 
streets of the city. The town was silent until they heard somebody scream.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Shiko tried to run to 
investigate it, but Bones stopped her, shaking her head. Soon the sound 
had ended as suddenly as it began. &quot;Please remember there is law 
in Duslan&#39; and all heroes end up with a dagger in their back,&quot; 

she warned her squire.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Soon enough the screaming 
had ended as suddenly as sudden as it began.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The girl looked longingly 
in the direction of where she heard the screaming coming from, but could 
do no more than sigh heavily and followed her master who once again 
began searching the streets for a clothier.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(That face…)&quot; 
whispered one of the shadows who trailed the trio.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot; (It&#39;s similar, 
but she would have aged by now. That girl speaks like a forest elf.)&quot; 
the other shadow commented.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(But didn&#39;t she 
run off to the forest three decades ago?)&quot; the first shadow said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(Are you saying 
they&#39;re related?)&quot; the second asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(Never know. We 
should tell Master Long, no?)&quot; the first suggested.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(The Den is too 
far away. They say their looking for a clothier. We should tell Lady 
Weiming instead!)&quot; the second replied.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(You&#39;re right. 
I&#39;ll take the back alleys and inform Lady Weiming of their coming while 
you stay behind make sure they reach the White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe,)&quot; 
the first said, slipping into a nearby alley.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;(Right!)&quot; 
the second shadow said.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;You girls, have 
no stamina!&quot; a woman said in the back rooms of the White Tiger&#39;s 
Wardrobe. &quot;If you die on me so easily then what I will be able 
to play with eh?&quot; She kicked aside a corpse of a naked girl whose 
body was covered in several wilts, cuts and scars as she walked to a 
cage in the far back of the room. Cracking a whip, the woman looked 
towards a cage containing several other girls and smiled. &quot;I&#39;m 
glad Master Long talked me into buying these slaves in bulk. They only 
last so long before they break. Now which of you am I going to play 
with next?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The girls, numbering 
between ten and twenty, were cramped in a cage so small that they barely 
had standing room. All been stripped naked save for a slave collar each 
wore. They shivered in fear and the coldness of the room, some crying, 
others begging for forgiveness while some given up on all hope. None 
would believe these girls were once the daughters and sisters of the 
city&#39;s very own residents whom their own fathers and brothers had sold 
to the slavers to pay for protection from the Dragon clan.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  As the woman walked 
to the cage and was about to open it, a shadow appeared behind her. 
&quot;You&#39;re interrupting my play time so you better have a good reason 
lest your death be slow and painful!&quot; the woman hissed, glaring 
at the shadow that kneeled behind her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Two women have 
entered Duslan&#39; in which has a face similar to <i>her</i>. They are 
in search of clothes and will being arriving here any time soon,&quot; 
the shadow said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The woman&#39;s eyes glowed 
with a sadistic joy. From ear to ear a wicked grin crossed her face. 
&quot;Is that so? Then I&#39;ll make sure to greet them properly! By chance 
does Master Long know yet?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;No milady, but 
I intend to tell him afterwards,&quot; the shadow said.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Take that body 
with you. I made sure to keep her face untouched so that he can sell 
it to his number one customer,&quot; the woman said pointing to corpse.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;As you wish milady,&quot; 
the shadow said grabbing the corpse and disappearing.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m sorry my pretties, 
but it looks like I&#39;ll have to greet some guests. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll 
be back!&quot; The woman said, turning away from the cage and walking 
behind a wall screen stripping of the tight fitting, black leather outfit 
she had been wearing, revealing the Chinese character of &quot;hu&quot; 

on her back.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;How long is this 
street?&quot; Shiko asked. &quot;Are we still on the same block?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s impossible 
to read the signs in this light,&quot; Bones said rubbing her eyes. 
&quot;If only there was somebody to ask for directions?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Are you lost?&quot; 

a voice asked behind them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;EEK!&quot; Shiko 
cried, hugging Bones with her hands unintentionally squeezing the knight&#39;s 
breasts.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;<i>GRRR!</i>&quot; 
Marrow growled, bearing her fangs.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Forgive me if 
I gave you a scare,&quot; said a cloaked figure behind them. &quot;But 
I didn&#39;t recognize your faces and thought you were new around these 
parts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well thank you,&quot; 
Bones said, smiling. <i>How convenient; just when we announce we&#39;re 
lost somebody steps out of nowhere to help us… You think we&#39;d be fooled 
so easily? </i>&quot;Would you by chance know where the closest clothier 
is?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;If you mean the 
White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe, just head down the street. You should be able 
to see it&#39;s sign from here…&quot; the cloaked figure pointed a finger 
in the direction of where the women had been going.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  As if cued, a distant 
light appeared at the end of the street.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I see it, but 
how come we couldn&#39;t see it now?&quot; the hunter asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s a special 
shop that only opens at midnight which, luckily for you, it now is! 
I hear they&#39;re having a sale so you better hurry before all the good 
clothes are taken!&quot; the cloaked said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;We&#39;ll be sure 
to make haste. Is there any way we can help you for your humble generosity?&quot; 

Bones asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t 
mind giving telling me your name?&quot; the cloaked figure asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Damn it! I can&#39;t 
really give use my knight name around here. There&#39;s a chance they&#39;ve 
heard of me and like hell am I going to use </i>
that <i>name… Well I guess I can always use </i>

her <i>name. </i>&quot;It&#39;s Gútóu Daiyu,&quot; the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  This took the cloaked 
figure by surprise. &quot;I, Is that so? Well nice to meet you, &#39;princess&#39; 
Daiyu,&quot; the cloaked figure said, bowing. &quot;Now if you don&#39;t 
mind, I must depart,&quot; the cloaked figure said, turning on heel 
and hastily retreating into an alley.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &#39;<i>Princess&#39;? Why do 
I have the feeling that I&#39;ve just made things tens times harder than 
us? </i>The knight wondered, looking at the cloaked figure.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Daiyu?&quot; Shiko 
asked looking at the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s my mother&#39;s 
maiden name. I thought I could in place of my &#39;real&#39; name to keep from 
drawing too much unwanted attention, but I fear it did just the opposite…&quot; 

Bones said, rubbing her forehead. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure this &quot;White 
Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe is some kind of trap, but we don&#39;t have much of a choice, 
stay on your guard.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Roger!&quot; The 
girl said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;By the way… 
you can let go of my breasts now,&quot; the knight added, seeing that 
the girl hadn&#39;t let go of her yet.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Sorry!&quot; The 
hunter cried retrieving her hands in embarrassment.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The two women and dog 
headed down the street, prepared for any trap that was thrown at them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Milady!&quot; 
The cloaked figure said, slipping through the back door of the White 
Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Are they coming?&quot; 
the woman asked.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes, but there&#39;s 
something you must know! The girl that looks like <i>her </i>
claims to have the same name as her!&quot; the cloaked figure said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well then we ever 
have a suicidal princess or a dumb liar, either way, I&#39;ll enjoy making 
scream in pain!&quot; the woman said, laughing sadistically.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;But if by some 
chance it&#39;s really <i>her</i>-&quot; the cloaked figure began.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Cuts and bruises 
will heal and that bitch knows it so if she dare gives me any shit about 
roughing the girl up a little, then I&#39;ll suggest to Master Long that 
the she&#39;s been withholding money from him. That&#39;ll surely shut her up!&quot; 
the woman said with a sinister grin. &quot;Now be gone! I have customers 
to attend to!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes milady,&quot; 
the cloaked figure said bowing and dashing through the back door.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Every second that 
passes makes me want to see if it&#39;s true… if the slave princess has 
really returned!&quot; the woman said laughing to herself.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The White Tiger&#39;s Wardrobe 
was hard to miss as it was the most whitest of all buildings, made with 
what appeared to be the same white marble as Coton&#39;s morgue. It had 
a large neon sign bearing a white tiger laying atop a wardrobe over 
a double door.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Am I blind or 
is are all painfully visible locations carefully hidden so that you 
can&#39;t find it until after you&#39;ve asked for directions?&quot; Bones asked 
Marrow.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well I guess they 
used the same architect…&quot; Shiko said. <i>I hope there&#39;s no corpses 
inside.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
The women entered the building to greet by a very alive and large white 
tiger that pounced on Marrow. </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Marrow!&quot; 
Bones cried, grabbing the tiger by the golden collar it wore and trying 
with all her strength to pull it off the dog.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Saber! Where&#39;s 
your manners? We don&#39;t eat our customer&#39;s pets, now do we?&quot; the 
women from the back room said. She wore here long brown hair up in twin 
braids on either side of her head two large loops, a gray, sleeveless 
tight fitting qipao, long gloves and thigh long boots.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The tiger reluctantly 
got off of Marrow who was hiding her head under her paws, whimpering.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Marrow are you 
okay?&quot; Bones said, looking the dog over for injuries.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Forgive her, she 
has a tendency to pounce on any little animal she can. It&#39;s a game to 
her,&quot; the woman said, shaking her head. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to punish 
her strictly later.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;…&quot; Shiko 
remained silently, clenching her fists so tightly that her knuckles 
were white. The knight may have been to preoccupied to notice the tiger&#39;s 
back side was patch work of long, thin lesions; the wounds from being 
whipped repeatedly. The sadistic tone of the woman&#39;s voice filled her 
with rage. <i>She&#39;s trying to hide it, but she&#39;s overjoyed with the 
idea of wounding it. Sure it&#39;s may not be the most well behaved creature, 
but to harm it to the extent of animal cruelty, how dare you take pleasure 
in it!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
&quot;Shiko-san, can you help me? You surely have more knowledge on 
animal anatomy than I,&quot; Bones asked in dry tones, sensing her squires 
ire.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Y, yes!&quot; 
the hunter said, kneeling beside the dog.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I saw the scars 
and I know how you feel, but please control your emotions… We can&#39;t 
afford to be making scene here. I&#39;ll report this to council and hopefully 
they can do on something,&quot; the knight said, squeezing the girl&#39;s 
hand comfortingly. <i>Even though I know that they can&#39;t do anything, 
let&#39;s allow her to hope for a while.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Right…&quot; 
the girl said sorrowfully. She gave a long look at the tiger who glared 
at it&#39;s master with clear disgust and sighed.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Judging by your 
dress, you must have a hard journey here… Worry not! We have the best 
clothes in all of Duslan&#39;!&quot; the woman said. <i>As cold as ice yet 
gentle as the spring breeze… if you&#39;re a fake, you&#39;re quite a good 
actor, &#39;princess&#39;, </i>the woman thought as she lead the women through 
a series of clothing wracks.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  They didn&#39;t drop their 
guard or forget the tiger, they went allowed themselves to enjoy picking 
through the clothes. It seemed that the only way for Shiko could keep 
herself from loosing her temper was hunting down the most revealing 
clothes to try on and show off in front of Bones, much to the knight&#39;s 
embarrassment. Though they merely had the intention of replacing their 
tattered clothes, the women ended up with a armful of clothes each.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;My what good tastes,&quot; 
the woman said smiling.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I fear we got 
carried away. I doubt I have enough money to pay for all for of this!&quot; 
Bones said, blushing embarrassedly.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Don&#39;t worry &#39;Slave 
Princess&#39; Diayu, I&#39;m more than sure you and your companion can pay for 
it and the rest of your tab back in the brothels!&quot; The woman drew 
a whip from her qipao and struck at Bones.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Don&#39;t you dare 
hurt her!&quot; Shiko cried, throwing herself in the whip&#39;s path. The 
girl flinched as the whip struck her.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Shiko-san!&quot; 
Bones grabbed the girl.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;I&#39;m okay, Bones-sensei,&quot; 
the girl said, smiling at her master. Blood trickle down her face from 
the wound the whip opened, spilling into one her eyes and down her cheek.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;As your master, 
it is my responsibility to protect your health even if it means throwing 
away my life. I cannot let anybody to harm my squire and go unpunished!&quot; 
the knight said. &quot;I don&#39;t care what happens to me, but I will not 
tolerate anything happening to her.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Yes, yes, preach 
all you want, you won&#39;t get far in this town, &#39;Princess&#39;,&quot; the 
woman said, snapping the whip again.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The caught the whip 
in her hand and clenched it shut, refusing to let go no matter how hard 
the woman tugged on it. Wrapping the whip around her hand, she charged 
forward and grabbed the woman in her free hand. &quot;(Destruction in 
tune, the power of decay, bring all I touch to ruin!)&quot; Smoke drifted 
under her hand, causing the woman to scream in agony. &quot;For the 
crimes of assaulting a knight and her squire, I punish you with social 
execution!&quot; She let go of the woman who fell to the floor clutching 
her face and screaming venomously at her.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Bones-sensei!&quot; 
Shiko said, looking at her master with fear. She wasn&#39;t afraid of her 
master, but rather for her. She remembered clearly upon entering being 
told to keep their status secret, but Bones had outright exposed themselves.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Even the gentlest 
dragon bears it fangs when it must protect it&#39;s loved ones,&quot; the 
knight said, wiping the blood off of the hunter&#39;s face. &quot;However 
I fear I&#39;ve jeopardized our cover. We better get business done and leave 
before things turns ugly.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;But the tiger!&quot; 

The hunter said.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The knight smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry. It has become a part of our business.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  They ignored the woman 
that rolled around the floor, screaming the most hideous of curses at 
them one, as they searched for the tiger. They caught glimpse of its 
tail as it passed through a door in the back of the clothier and followed 
through. What they found on the other side shocked them.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  Having entered the back 
room, they saw the cage filled with naked, shivering women, begging 
to be let free. The tiger sat by the cage looking at them with eyes 
filled with hope.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Thank you honored 
Tora-sama,&quot; the hunter said, bowing the tiger. Looking at the lock 
she saw that there was no key hole or other visible manner of unlocking 
it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;It&#39;s a spell-lock 
only the person who locked it can unlock it,&quot; the knight said. 

&quot;(Dust to dust, ash to ash, turn everything I touch into rust!)&quot; 
With the spell&#39;s completion, she laid her hand on the lock and caused 
it to rust. With a swift yank, the lock broke off. She threw the cage 
door open and yelled, &quot;You&#39;re free now! Escape while you have the 
chance!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  None of the women moved. 
&quot;Why? The dragon-ladies will just hunt us down and capture us again. 
We were sold to the Dragon clan to pay off our family&#39;s debts. If we 
did escape, we&#39;d be sold straight to the brothels or worse,&quot; said 
one of the girls.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Or worse?&quot; 

the knight asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;We would be where 
we are now. There were originally thirty of us altogether and now less 
than twenty remain because our current master spends her time torturing 
us to death. It&#39;s the price we pay for trying to escape. If we escape 
again we will be killed and sold to their best customer, the necrophiliac 
Neco Lee…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Neco Lee… Anybody 
who does business with that woman regardless of the fact she&#39;s a criminal 
is aiding and abiding a public enemy! If that is the case, I will bring 
the entire Skullguard on this Dragon Clan if I must to shut it down!&quot; 
The knight declared.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Long time, no 
see sister,&quot; spoke a man dressed in a black changshan, trousers, 
dou li with a veil covering the back and sides of his head and half 
veil covering his face from the nose down. He sat on an overstuff couch, 
embraced by two identical twin girls with the most peculiar of skin. 
In one hand he carried a pipe in which mysterious green smoke rose from 
it&#39;s bowl.</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  The girls that were 
wrapped about wore their black hair in ox horns and wore black sleeveless 
qipao with a immodestly short skirt, thigh long socks. Their skin held 
a green tint and hanging from their forehead was a mysterious talisman 
with &quot;xianshi&quot; or &quot;Immortal Corpse&quot; written on it.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;So what have you 
brought for me?&quot; Neco Lee asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Well there&#39;s been 
a complication. You see, one of the Tigerqueen&#39;s cub had bought some 
slaves from and, in the process, smuggled my gift for you from under 
my nose. I fear if you wish to have it, you must hunt her down and take 
from her (preferably cold, dead) fingers,&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Where can I find 
this little cub?&quot; Neco Lee said angrily.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;The White Tiger&#39;s 
Wardrobe. Feel free to level the place. It&#39;s an eyesore and I&#39;ve been 
wanting to get back at that damn Tiger Clan for ever since I first stole 
this city from them. They&#39;ve been ruining the name of the Dragon Clan 
to get back at us and stand in our way of bring organization to this 
lawless hellhole. You do as you wish with the slaves she&#39;s bought,&quot; 
the man said, waving dismissively.</font></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">  &quot;Though I don&#39;t 
like how you&#39;re ordering me around, I&#39;ll gladly clean up after you, 
brother Long,&quot; Neco Lee said. &quot;I&#39;ll make that bitch pay for 
stealing my toys.&quot; The girl said with a wicked grin on her face.</font></p>
