<h1>Between the Lines (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ilze.html">Ilze</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Are you guys going to the Lucas party this weekend?&quot; I open my eyes, 
searching for the person who spoke last. I spot the male easily, it was 
Joey Smith. He flashes a million dollar smile at his friends, his 
chestnut hair blowing in the wind.

&quot;Probably.&quot; I look over at the next speaker, James Luxenburg. &quot;I heard 
there was gonna be free beer.&quot; His voice doesnt really show any signs of 
humor and is barely audible in the crowded courtyard of Escort* High 
School.

Tamara Dickson laughs anyways, a annoying preppy laugh, one that I had 
never been too fond of, &quot;I&#39;m going.&quot; She says jubilantly, her bronze arm 
held in the air.

&quot;How about you, Lex?&quot; James looks at me, his green-ish blue eyes looking 
at her lazilly. I look at James and smile at him. I never really 
understood how James, or Burg as some called him, wound up being such 
close friends with me and my group. Most people would classify Burg as a 
goth or a punk. He always dressed in heavy black clothing and constantly 
wore jewelry. His jet black hair was quite long but always spiked up and 
had a shine to it. Not in a manga sort of way but... it was hard to 
explain. James also constantly wore dark make-up, black lipstick and 
dark eyeliner. He played in a punk band called No Regard, in which he 
was the lead guitarist. &quot;Lex?&quot; He asks again after a few moments of not 
answering.

I shake my head and shrug, &quot;I dunno. Sounds kinda dumb to me.&quot; I lean 
back in my chair and yawn, &quot;You know what Tora&#39;s partys are like. He 
just invites all the jocks and preps in hopes of getting some 
cheerleaders drunk.&quot; I roll my eyes, thinking on Tora Lucas&#39; last party 
in which he tried to make me the victim of one of his partys.

&quot;Thats true.&quot; Kelli Lancey this time. Kelli had to be my best friend and 
she always had been, ever since the 2nd grade. Kelli was probably the 
most popular girl in school. She was definatly the prettiest, with long 
blonde hair with streaks of red and her baby blue eyes. She was a 
all-around cheerleader, the captain of the football cheerleading team 
and the basketball cheerleading team. All the boys in school wanted to 
go out with her but none had ever done so, for one reason. Kelli was a 
lesbian and had been since she became a Freshman, thats four years. I 
know things about Kel that she would never want anyone to know about. I 
know that she is beaten and sexually abused by her father and brother 
and that is the reason she had never trusted men, the reason she turned 
to women for love and nurturing. I also know that her mother didnt leave 
her &#39;beautiful&#39; family when she was young. Her mom was shot in a drug 
deal gone bad when Kelli was ten. I have always felt sorry for my best 
friend and wondered why she never said anything about her horrible home 
life, instead she hid it all behind a beautiful smile and happy-go-lucky 
attitude that had a few hints of bitchiness.

I do have one thing that I despise Kelli for. After all the men found 
out that Kelli was a lesbian, they all turned to the second best... and 
guess who that is. Now, I&#39;m not saying I hate men or anything like that, 
I&#39;m just saying I dont like having guys go out of their way to flirt 
with me or ask me out. I have actually only had two boyfriends in my 
entire high school career. One was a three-week fling with a guy who 
went to Ben Franklin HS. The realtionship went bad after I learned he 
had two other girlfriends at his own school. My second boyfriend was 
Joey Smith. We were the school poster couple. The Jock and The Prep but 
it didnt work out quite like we hoped. Joey and I, we just werent good 
for eachother but the strange thing is, is that we became even closer 
after the break up.

About my sexuality, as far as that goes I&#39;m straight as an arrow. I cant 
say I havent considered women but I&#39;ve never found a girl I&#39;ve been 
attracted to. The closest I&#39;ve come to a lesbian relationship is with 
Kelli. One night she came to my house after being beaten by her brother, 
I let her stay at my home for the night. We watched some old movie and 
halfway through it, she just broke down and started crying. I comforted 
her the best I could and the evening ended up with a shared kiss between 
me and Kelli then she fell asleep in my arms. We never spoke about the 
moment again.

The bell rings, ending the conversation. I stand and gather my books. I 
have three classes until school is dismissed and each class is a breeze. 
Nutrition, Mass Media*, and Art. I like all those classes a lot and have 
friends in each class. I walk with my large group of friends to our 
lockers then we all split up to our last classes. I head to Ms. McAfee&#39;s 
class along with Kelli and Laura. Nutrition is a extremly easy class and 
I dont understand why more people dont take it. It&#39;s a easy credit. All 
we do it cook and occassionally figure up how much calories are in our 
meals. Not to mention the fact that Ms. McAfee is a awesome teacher. She 
never punishes anyone, part of the reason most of the clowns were in 
that class, and she is just a fun teacher.

We get to Ms. McAfee&#39;s room before the late bell rings and take our 
usual seats at one of the four tables in the room. Today was one of the 
rare boring days in which we were actually opening our text books. I pay 
attention for approxamitly 3.2 seconds until I drift into thought of 
what we were doing in my 8th period class, Mass Media. It had to be my 
favorite class in the whole day. My thoughts soon drift to Tora Lucas&#39; 
party and something suddenly clicks in my mind. Burg never goes to 
partys unless his band is playing in there and Tora is definatly not a 
big fan of punk music so I doubt he had No Regard playing there. Burg 
said he was going because of the free beer? From my memory, James 
Luxenburg is not a heavy drinker except for the occassional shot of 
whiskey. I ponder the thought for the rest of 7th period until the bell 
rings and McAfee sends us off with her usual parting gift, a piece of 
hard tack candy that she makes out of boredom every night.

&quot;Bleh.&quot; Laura says and hands her piece of hard tack to Kelli. She waits 
until we are out of the classroom then says, &quot;I cant stand that candy. 
How can you guys eat that stuff?&quot;

I laugh and shrug. Laura didnt like anything. She was a very picky 
vegiterrean who only liked a few vegetables. I am stumped with the 
question of how she lives because all I ever see her eat is cellery and 
apples. Laura is also a clean freak. She cant stand the thought of germs 
all over the world and is constantly cleaning something or complaining 
about the sanitary conditions of the school. &quot;You&#39;re quite the 
individual.&quot; That is something I tend to say to Laura daily and that is 
just the sentence to use when you describe her. There isnt really any 
other way to describe the 5;2, sandy-haired girl.

With a offhanded farewell, I leave my two friends as I head for room 
222, the Mass Media room. Half way there I join Burg, the only one of my 
friends in Mass Media, and two of his goth friends, X and Mary. X is the 
drummer in Burg&#39;s band. His full name is Xzorion Romano. He has very 
dark skin and bleached white hair that he has grown out to the small of 
his back that he keeps in braids. He is the only one of Burg&#39;s friends 
that I have ever really talked to much. Mary is a very quiet, gothic 
girl. She has extremly pale skin and jet black hair. She is short and 
slightly plump. She has been constantly picked on because she is slow 
and I dont think Mary likes me much because most of the people who 
picked on her are my friends.

Burg gives a quiet &#39;hello&#39; and we continue to Mass Media room quietly. 
The four of us were greeted by the rest of the class, mainly skater 
boys, goths, and nerds. I dont know all that many of the people in the 
class personally but a few. Burg is the person I am closest to but then 
again, he is the only one I actually hang out with outside class. Burg&#39;s 
entire band is in Mass Media and I have met and talked with all of them 
but every time I talk to them when they are all together, I feel like an 
unwanted stranger and end up leaving after only a few minutes.

I take a seat next to Burg in the classroom part of room 222 and Mr. 
Finn greets all of us, &quot;Good day, class. I bet you&#39;re all looking 
foreward to todays activities, right?&quot; He smiles brightly and leans 
against his podium. Finn is a large man with big, wire-rimmed glasses 
and a pig-like face. He is definatly my favorite teacher. He claps his 
hands together, &quot;Okay. Today we are working on the Jr. High Video 
Yearbook. Let&#39;s split up into groups. We&#39;ve already decided that X and 
Arc are going to be on Radio today so that leaves the rest of us to 
split into groups and go out and get to filming. So, split up into three 
groups of four. Grab a camera and get to it, alright?&quot;

The class immediatly explodes into talking as everyone tries to find 
their friends. I keep close to Burg so that I will be in a group with 
him. Burg has several friends that I dont know but he always seems to 
fit me into his groups, something I have always liked him for. Burg is 
sometimes like a big brother and sometimes like a distant relative to 
me. We are very close, he always looks after me but he also has several 
things about him that I dont know about. He&#39;s mysterious but I dont 
mind. Everyone in my loop of friends has things about them that they 
dont want anyone to know about and we all respect that.

Burg and I are joined by two other classmates. Nigel, a foreign exchange 
student from Turkey who has a broken right arm, and Cameron, one of 
Burg&#39;s goth friends. We talk among eachother, deciding on jobs. We elect 
that Cameron will be the cameraman and that I will be the one who 
chooses students to be in our videos. Nigel and Burg will switch between 
who will be on camera. We agree on this and Cam grabs the camera and we 
set out on our assignments.

The rest of the day passes by uneventful. Art is nothing special, Mr. 
Humphrey a.k.a HP talks about shading and such then tells us about the 
assignment we are going to be working on for the rest few weeks. We are 
supposed to draw one individual, someone we have deep feelings for then 
we are supposed to draw our emotions in color behind the person. Before 
we dismissed, he said to think a lot about who we are going to choose 
and he also added that the emotion didnt particularly have to be love. I 
immediatly decided I&#39;ll probably just draw my Grandpa, who is probably 
the family member I love the most.

After school, I get together with most of my friends on campus and we 
talk for awhile. We are unhappily joined by Tora Lucas and his annoying 
brother Lance. None of us really like Tora or Lance very well but Tora&#39;s 
family was rich and he used to throw some awesome partys, before he 
became sex crazed.

&quot;So...?&quot; Tora said suspencfully and decided to continue after no one 
said anything, &quot;Whose coming to da part-ay?&quot;

Everyone gave their own answers, most people saying they&#39;d come except 
for Kelli and I. Kelli shrugged and said she&#39;d have to ask her dad 
first. I knew that she never asked her dad for permission on anything 
but I didnt say anything about it. All anyone else knew about Kelli&#39;s 
family is that she lives &#39;happily&#39; with her big brother and father. I 
shrugged as well and said, &quot;I probably will. Depends on if anything 
comes up.&quot;

Tora shrugged and took the answer. He leaves in a few moments, said he 
had to go to the mall and pick up &#39;party supplies.&#39; We all knew he was 
going to pay his uncle to get them a couple packs of beer. In a few 
minutes, I excuse myself from my friends when I remember that I was 
supposed to pick up my grandpa&#39;s prescription at the pharmacy. I go 
through the parking lot and come upon my car, a slightly dented old 
Honda that I got for my 16th birthday. I take the car out of the school 
parking lot and drive down the street until I come upon the &#39;business 
district&#39; of Escort. I drive along the parking lot of Rite-Aid, looking 
for a parking spot. All I find is one spot that is between two large 
vans. When I took my driver&#39;s test... I kinda failed the parrallel 
parking part but I did good enough that the instructor passed me anyways 
but I didnt want to take the risk of hitting either of the cars so I 
decide to look for another spot. Finding nothing, I nearly lose hope 
until I think up an idea. Right across the street from Rite-Aid was 
Save-A-Ton, a grocery store. It had a large, nearly empty parking lot 
but there was a sign out front that said &#39;Save-A-Ton Parking Only.&#39; It 
was a risk because the local sheriff constantly patrolled this area 
but... grandpa needs the medicine so I drive into the parking lot and 
park my car neatly between two others. I jump out of my automobile and 
jog across the street to the pharmacy where I get in and out in less 
than ten minutes with Grandpa&#39;s medication but when I cross the street, 
I am disheartened to find the good ol&#39; sheriff standing next to my 
Honda, he seems to be waiting for me.

&quot;Shit...&quot; I mumble as I walk up to the car and smile happily to the 
police officer, &quot;Is there a... problem, officer?&quot; I wince as I repeat 
the stupid line that I always hear from movies.

The officer looks up at me and tips his hat a little on his bald head, 
&quot;Did you see the sign, miss? It says that parkings restricted to only 
this store&#39;s customers.&quot;

I nervously pick a piece of brown hair our of my face, keeping my smile 
planted on my face, &quot;Yeah, I saw it. I, uh, parked here so my friend 
could run in and pick up some groceries but I decided to run across the 
street and pick up my grandfather&#39;s medicine while I wait.&quot; I mentally 
pat myself on the back, suprised that I could come up with a excuse so 
quickly and it actually sounded kinda good.

The sheriff appeared disbeleiving, &quot;Is that so? Well, could you run in 
and get you&#39;re friend so I can see that you aint lying?&quot;

I want to punch the pig but I manage to hold myself back and hold up a 
finger, &quot;One minute.&quot; I sprint into the little grocery store and try to 
think of something to do. &#39;I can always sneak out the back...&quot; I thought 
to myself as I stroll through the store, &quot;No, then I&#39;ll get convicted to 
resisting arrest or something dumb like that. What do I do...?&quot; I curse 
silently, watching the tile floor as I stroll briskly through the 
aisles. Suddenly, I run right into someone else and end up falling right 
on my backside. I blink a few times and look around, wondering what had 
happened. I look up and see someone standing in front of me. &quot;Shit...&quot; I 
say but quickly cover my mouth and fall into apology as I struggle to 
stand up, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I should have been watching where I was going, 
I-&quot;

My hand is taken by the stranger and I&#39;m lifted to my feet. I smile 
shyly and mutter a thank you. I finally lift by head to get a look at 
the stranger as I brush off my jeans. It was a woman who was probably in 
her early 20&#39;s. She has black hair with several streaks of red, and 
chestnut colored eyes. I also note that the woman is oriental, shown by 
her slanted eyes and tan skin but she is probably only half-oriental 
because she is tall and has that &#39;I&#39;m-an-American&#39; look to it. &quot;No 
Problem.&quot; She says with a chuckle. I take the time and noticed that the 
woman is pretty, not beautiful but pretty.

I blush and nod, &quot;Sorry.&quot; I rub the back of my head but suddenly 
something crosses my mind as I turn to scurry away from the stranger. I 
turn back around quikcly causing my hair to fall into my face 
annoyingly, &quot;H-hey. Can I ask you a favor?&quot;

The woman cocks her head, dsplaying a pierced earlobe with a simply 
earring hanging from it, &quot;Uh, sure. What&#39;s up?&quot;

&#39;This is stupid.&#39; I think, &#39;I dont even know this person and I just 
nearly ran her over.&#39; I look at her face, she&#39;s waiting for my answer. I 
smile, &quot;Could you... pretend to be my friend?&quot;

She looks confused, taken aback, &quot;W-What? I dont get it...&quot;

I giggle, sounding like an idiot, &quot;Let me explain. I parked in this 
parking lot and went to the pharmacy to get a precription and a cop was 
going to give me a ticket but I said I have a friend in here and I need 
you to pretend to be my friend... please?&quot; I really do sound stupid. I 
barely even made an sense.

The woman nods slowly, sorting the information out, &quot;Um... okay, I 
think. Let&#39;s go.&quot; She nods, a look of pretend determination of her face.

I turn on my heel and walk briskly out of the grocery store, the woman 
right behind me. I lead her to my car and look at the cop, &quot;Here she 
is.&quot; I say chipperly, &quot;My friend...&quot; I mentally kick myself, we dont 
know eachother&#39;s names!

The woman smiles, wrapping an arm around my shoulders, &quot;Yep. My good 
friend little... erm... girl...&quot; She laughs nervously.

The cop looks at us strangely and nods slowly, &quot;So, you were shopping 
here?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; The woman says quickly and I wince. &#39;She cant act...&#39;

The officer puts away his pen and paper, &quot;Okay then.&quot; He turns his gaze 
back to me, &quot;But dont be doing that again. I&#39;ll only let it slip this 
time.&quot; The cop wags a finger at me scoldingly then turns around and 
enters his cruiser. He drives off with one last wave. We both wave back 
nervously.

I look back at the woman and let out a sigh of releif, &quot;Thanks. I owe ya 
one.&quot;

She laughs and wipes a hand across her forehead, &quot;Nah, it&#39;s fine. That 
was fun.&quot; She smiles at me sweetly then something clicks in her mind, 
&quot;Maybe we should introduce ourselves in case we gotta do that again. I&#39;m 
Karen Tanimoto.&quot; She extends a petite hand.

I nod and take shake her hand, I notice both of our hands are sweaty, 
&quot;Alexia... uh, LaFayette.&quot;

She smiles and takes her hands back, wiping it on her blouse. She nods 
to me, &quot;Well, I&#39;d better be going. It was fun.&quot; She turns around and 
walks back to the store. I smile and get back into my car with a sigh of 
relief. I turn on the engine and click the radio on before I drive out 
of the parking lot and get on my way home.
