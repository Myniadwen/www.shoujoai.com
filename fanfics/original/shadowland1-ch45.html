Simple Bonds

Kima and Kim sat in the lobby, staring at each other, while Natalie sat 
anxiously next to Kima. Anyone who entered the room could feel the 
tension between the two redheads. Neither spoke, and yet volumes were 
expressed. Frustrated, Natalie tried to think of some way to break the 
atmosphere, but found it very hard to think when these two girls didn&#39;t 
seem to want to give an inch to the other. To make matters worse Natalie 
felt that some of Kim&#39;s rage was being directed at herself and she had 
no idea why.

At that moment Jenn burst into the western dorms, pulling Cherilyn by 
the hand. She saw Kima and quickly ventured over to her, &quot;Kima!&quot; She 
panted.

Kima broke from Kim&#39;s gaze to look at her friend, &quot;Jenn?&quot; She asked, 
concerned by Jenn&#39;s uncontrolled breathing, &quot;Are you alright? Did 
something happen?&quot; She got to her feet and noticed Cherilyn standing 
close to Jenn with fear in her eyes, &quot;Who is this?&quot; She asked with a 
smile. 

Kim abruptly stood to find out what was going on, peering around Jenn at 
the new arrival.

&quot;A... friend...&#148; Jenn said between pants, &quot;Cherilyn...&quot; She swallowed 
hard. 

Natalie got to her feet, &quot;I&#39;ll get you some water.&quot; She stated, running 
into the cafeteria. 

Jessica appeared from the office where she was working, &quot;Cherilyn? From 
the East Wing?&quot; She asked looking at the girl. 

Cherilyn nervously nodded without saying a word. 

&quot;Something must be up if you are here.&quot; Jessica continued. 

Natalie returned with two paper cups of water, &quot;Here.&quot; She handed one to 
each girl. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Jenn accepted the cup gratefully drained her cup in an 
instant, &#147;This school is too dammed big.&#148; She said between swallows.   

&quot;Where&#39;d you run from?&quot; Jessica asked. 

&quot;The East Dorms.&quot; Jenn explained, &quot;Tanya is missing. She left a note 
saying she went into the woods.&quot; 

&quot;The Western Woods?&quot; Jessica exclaimed in shock. 

Jenn nodded and retrieved the letter from her back pocket to have 
Natalie take it from her, &quot;Why would anyone go in there?&quot; Natalie asked 
skimming over the note. 

&quot;She thinks the Head Mistresses will allow her to move here.&quot; Jenn 
explained, finishing off the last of the water. 

&quot;What?&quot; Jessica shook her head in confusion, &quot;What would make anyone 
think something silly like that?&quot; She stepped closer to Natalie to get a 
better look at the note. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jenn replied, &quot;But that is where she is.&quot; She then 
turned to Kima, &quot;Kima, do you know anything about the woods?&quot; She asked, 
her eyes pleading to the girl for some kind of answers. 

Kima nervously glanced around, avoiding any eye contact, &quot;I...&quot; She 
tried to think of how to put things into words, &quot;I&#39;m from the mirrors. I 
know nothing about the woods. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She said with a sigh. 

&quot;I know...&quot; Natalie said grimly, glancing up from the paper, &quot;Alyson 
taught me about the Alleys and the Woods. It is linked to the realm of 
death and guarded by three of the nine angels of death. It is supposed 
to be a place where the shadows enter our world from another. Sort of 
like a doorway of sorts.&quot;

&quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot; Jenn exclaimed, &quot;How can a place like 
that exist?&quot;

&quot;How can a mirror reflection be standing beside you?&quot; Natalie retorted, 
nodding towards Kima, causing the girl to nervously play with the bottom 
of her shirt. 

&quot;You&#39;re not her twin?&quot; Cherilyn finally spoke up in amazement. 

Kima rubbed the back of her head as Cherilyn looked from her to Kim and 
back again, &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I am.&quot; 

&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Jenn asked, &quot;Tanya is alone out there and we need to 
find her.&quot; 

&quot;Entering the Western Woods is not that easy.&quot; Kris&#39;s voice spoke up 
from across the room. Everyone spun around to find Kris standing near 
the pool tables, an air of gloom hung around the girl, &quot;You don&#39;t want 
to enter there.&quot; she said in a weak voice. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Jenn demanded. When Kris turned the pain her friend&#39;s eyes 
was so clear that Jenn could feel her own heart drop. 

&quot;It is a place where those who wish to die go.&quot; Kris looked at Jessica 
for a moment and let out a deep sigh, &quot;I didn&#39;t think you would 
understand. You have too much to live for now. You once understood, so 
maybe part of you still does.&quot;

&quot;Kris, what are you talking about?&quot; Jenn gave the girl a puzzled look, 
&quot;You are not making any sense.&quot;

Kris turned to gaze out the window, &quot;I&#39;m the only one who can go get 
her.&quot; She set her forehead upon the glass of the window, &quot;Only those 
wishing for death can find those of the same nature.&quot;

&quot;Come on, Kris you have to stop beating yourself up.&quot; Jessica pleaded, 
stepping closer to the girl. 

Kris clenched at her chest, &quot;This is how things must be. I know that 
now.&quot; Kris pushed off of the window frame and turned around, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want any of you to follow me.&quot;

&quot;Why shouldn&#39;t I?&quot; Jenn returned angry and confused, &quot;Why do you always 
have to be so damn chivalrous and princely all the time.&quot; She cried, 
&quot;You are always being like that. Is this what you want? Do you really 
want to die?&quot; 

Kris touched her chest, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I never meant to hurt you...&quot; She 
started towards the door when Jessica stepped in front of the door, 
blocking her exit. She glared angrily at Kris, only to have the girl 
avoid her gaze by glancing at the floor. Jessica then turned to look at 
the group of girls that had gathered in the lobby that day. Each she 
only knew for a couple of days, but had grown so fond of. The anger 
melted from her eyes as they returned to Kris again. 

&quot;I&#39;m going with you.&quot; Jessica said in a determined matter. 

&quot;What?&quot; Kris glanced up to see if the girl was kidding only to be 
greeted by a sad smile, &quot;You can&#39;t go in there. You might not come 
back.&quot; 

Jessica nervously clenched and unclenched her fist, &quot;You are all family 
to me and I can&#39;t just watch you leave.&quot; Jessica exclaimed, &quot;I can&#39;t 
stop you, but I can at least try to be of some help and maybe we both 
will return.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure as hell not staying behind.&quot; Jenn added stubbornly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
believe in all this business about the forest equalling our deaths. I 
just want my friends back.&quot; She gazed at her feet, &quot;All of them.&quot; She 
muttered softly.

&quot;Jenn?&quot; Kris looked at her friend, &quot;I thought you hated me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m mad at you.&quot; Jenn stated, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to die on me.&quot; she 
declared, &quot;I...&quot; 

Kima looked coldly between Jenn and Kris, &quot;I&#39;m going too.&quot; She affirmed, 
&quot;What about you Nat?&quot; She turned to the blonde.

&quot;Do you realize what you are all planning?&quot; Natalie rose with a sigh, 
&quot;No one has ever returned from that place, ever.&quot; 

&quot;I have.&quot; Kris stated grimly.

Just then the door to the dorm opened and Alyson came crashing in, 
dropping her things onto the ground as she toppled after them. Jessica 
was in time to catch the girl before she hit the ground. 
&quot;ALYSON!!!&quot; Natalie called out in surprise as she ran to her friend&#146;s 
side, &quot;What happened to you?&quot;

&quot;I ran...&quot; Alyson took a deep breath, &quot;From home...&quot; 

Natalie looked curiously at the duffle back in the foyer, &quot;Did you bring 
all your stuff with you?&quot; She asked confused. 

&quot;I decided.&quot; Alyson struggled to her feet, &quot;I&#39;m staying here with you.&quot; 
She gave Natalie a weak smile.
