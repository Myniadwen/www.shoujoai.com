<a href="../original/magstar-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Friday night, Keneda High School

Friday night. Darkness settles across the sky as dozens of teenage 
partygoers leave the streamer-clad auditorium of Keneda high school. 
Couples casually walk home together, tired and withdrawn from the 
electricity of the evening. Unknowing to them however, two characters 
walk among them. These two characters, Yai Kitana and Keiya Shindo 
control their destiny and the destiny of these two is about to change. 

As she stood on the cold, hard pavement, Yai felt the chilling wind 
blow a gentle gust. She shivered a little, but simply waved Akira off. 
Not five minutes ago, Akira protested that he take Yai home, since it 
was getting late. It had always been a part of his nature to be so 
protective, which was a part of him that Yai knew all too well. 
However, she was in no mood to be thwarted, so made her point in going 
home alone more than known. Quickly he got the hint and decided to 
leave. He did care for her, but sometimes she could be so persistent. 
Akira waved back, and drove off.

&#147;Akira. You&#146;re so sweet. But I just need to handle this alone. I need 
to find Keiya. I just can&#146;t believe that she and Shingo are&#133;&#148;

As she watched the crimson red car drive off, Yai fell into a world of 
her own thoughts. What had happened tonight had been so troubling, and 
she had no real reason to why it bothered her so much. Keiya had 
arrived to the dance with a guy called Shingo Hirayama. Shingo was 
actually a very nice person, who transferred to Keneda 3 years ago. 
Not only was he a straight-A student, he was an incredible athlete 
with both the staff and the students respecting him. He himself had a 
choice of many women from Keneda, but only one had caught his eye. 
Keiya. Keiya also had a fine choice of men, with dozens of them 
swarming around her asking her out on dates. Normally she turned them 
down flat, but it seemed as if Shingo had her under his magic. It was 
no surprise to Yai that the Lilac-haired starlet was going to the 
dance with someone, however she had not expected to see the two of 
them that close to each other. This revelation secretly tore Yai 
apart, but why she was so unnerved was lost to her. 

Yai had never had a problem with the tons of guys that asked Keiya 
out. But now, only one guy had had managed to sway Keiya, and it was 
driving her crazy.  She couldn&#146;t understand why though. Why was it 
making her feel so strangely? Did it even make sense? Why should it 
matter to her how close they are? 

She decided to talk to Keiya herself. Maybe&#133;maybe she wasn&#146;t really 
that serious about him, maybe they were not&#133;in love&#133; 

As Yai began to walk behind the Auditorium towards Keiya&#146;s way home, 
the northern road, she couldn&#146;t help but feel&#133; happy, knowing that 
there was a possibility of Shingo and her and being just friends&#133;

On the end of the northern road, Keiya herself was walking home 
briskly and calmly.  She always liked walking alone. It gave the 
lilac-haired starlet a chance to think things over. A chance to reach 
a moment of clarity, and at this point she needed it. Her mind was 
being rattled with a tsunami of conflicting emotions and desires. 

On the one hand, she had Shingo, a great guy who was willing to have a 
serious relationship with her, and on the other she had Yai, a girl, 
who had no feelings for her, and even if she did, the difficulty of 
that kind of relationship would be immense. So why did simply 
contemplating the idea seem so right? She had been trying so hard to 
avoid her, but it seemed like the more she tried to push her away, the 
closer she came. It just pulled her closer to her heart. 

&#147;I&#146;ve been going over this for 2 weeks. It&#146;s becoming so hard now. I 
could have a good thing with Shingo. He&#146;s so kind, yet strong willed 
and confident. So why am I blowing it over something that could never 
work?&#148;

Suddenly, she stopped walking as she heard the sound of pacing 
footsteps, coming closer and closer to her. As she turned round, she 
saw Yai. Yai. The one person she just wasn&#146;t ready to face. Keiya then 
stared up into the sky and murmured, 

&#147;What do you have against me?&#148; 

As Yai slowed down when she reached Keiya, Keiya greeted her, and 
tried her hardest to seem pleased, but inside she was cursing her own 
bad luck.

&#147;Hiya&#133;Yai.&#148; The disappointment in Keiya&#146;s voice was evident, but not 
so evident to Yai. 

&#147;(Huff)&#133;K&#133;(huff) Keiya&#133;(huff) can I&#133;(huff)&#133;walk with you?&#148;

&#147;Sure. I guess.&#148;

As Yai caught her breath, the two began to slowly walk home. While 
they did, Yai shuffled a bit. The two were in silence. It was an 
uncomfortable silence that was chewing away at her nerves. Soon Yai&#146;s 
will to break the tension between them overpowered her.

&#147;So did you enjoy the dance?&#148; Yai asked as she looked at her Lilac 
haired friend. Keiya didn&#146;t automatically look back at Yai, she just 
walked on and a couple seconds later she responded;

&#147;Yeah. It was great.&#148;

Silence.

&#147;A lot of people were there. I guess it was popular.&#148; Yai said, still 
trying to break the ramparts of ice blocking themselves from each 
other, however Keiya was not so willing. 

&#147;I guess so.&#148;

&#147;Why do you keep cutting me off? Talk to me!&#148;   

&#147;&#133;So are you and Shingo&#133;going out&#133;?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Keiya&#146;s head instantly jerked up and the crystal eyed girl 
glared at Yai with such confusion and surprise that she caught the 
chestnut haired girl off-guard. 

&#147;&#133;I&#146;m sorry&#133; I just&#133;I thought that&#133;&#148;

&#147;Shingo and I are friends&#133;nothing more.&#148; Keiya looked away from Yai 
again.

&#147;So then why did you let him kiss you?&#148;

&#147;Keiya, listen I&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148; Keiya didn&#146;t look up, or turn around, just walked along
.
&#147;&#133;N-nothing.&#148; Keiya&#146;s iciness put Yai off. She reacted so harshly to 
the mention of Shingo. Maybe something happened between them? A stream 
of guilt passed over the chestnut haired girl when the idea of 
something driving a wedge between Keiya and Shingo caused a strange 
combo of relief and happiness to fill her. 

&#147;Ok.&#148; Keiya sped up her walking. Did she want to leave?

&#147;No wait!&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;I do have something I need to talk to you about. You&#133;you see I 
&#133;Keiya?&#148; 

As Yai stepped in front of Keiya to talk to her, the lilac haired 
starlet&#146;s attention lay elsewhere. She kept searching the background 
around them.  As she saw the expression on Keiya&#146;s face, she became 
instantly worried. 

&#147;Keiya? What&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t you feel it&#133;we have a demon around here. A fairly powerful one 
too.&#148;

&#147;A demon attack?&#148;

&#147;Come on. Let&#146;s go. We need to kill it before it hurts somebody.&#148;

Keiya ran into a park at the edge of the northern road, followed by 
Yai. As they entered the park, the demonic presence of the Dark force 
made itself evident. They both searched the distance of the park, to 
see a figure in the far distance. 

&#147;Yai listen to me&#133;transform&#133;&#148;

&#147;O...ok.&#148;

&#147;Lovestar power&#133;transform!&#148;

&#147;Waterstar power&#133;transform!&#148;

In a flash of blinding light, Keiya Shindo and Yai Kitana transform 
into Waterstar and Lovestar the magic starsoldiers.  Waterstar and 
Lovestar run into the distance across that cold wet grass, stopping 
instantly as they reached the dark figure ahead of them.

&#147;You there! Who are you? Are you a part of the Dark force?&#148; Lovestar 
yelled.

&#147;Heh, heh, heh! Well kind of. You see I&#146;m a sort of a mercenary. I 
have no ties to the Queen.&#148;

&#147;So you work for money.&#148; Waterstar seemed dejected. A mercenary? How 
much more pathetic can a Demonmonster become?  

Wong- Lao crossed his arms. &#147;Yes. The man called Tanzanite sent me to 
destroy you.&#148;

&#147;Tanzanite?&#148;

&#147;Tanzanite? The guy I fought?!&#148;

&#147;Look I didn&#146;t come here to talk. I came here to destroy you and your 
other little friend. Now defend yourselves&#133;&#148;

&#147;Kill us huh&#133;you wont succeed. Let&#146;s do it!&#148;

&#147;Are you nuts?&#148;

&#147;Lovestar calm down. There is two of us and one of him. How hard can 
he be to beat?&#148;

&#147; Heh, heh, heh, heh. Silly star girl.&#148;

The man cloaked in darkness stepped forward. At first glance, he 
appeared human but as he stepped forth into the revealing powers of 
the light, this was proven to be false. He was actually much taller. 
His muscle structure was bulky but not so much that it inhibited his 
agility. His skin was a very dark purple, with strangely crystal blue 
eyes. He had a large, sleek ivory white horn curving from the back of 
his muscular, and narrow head, to the small of his back. 

Wearing nothing but a worn out pair of earth bangers, and a large 
tattoo of a Chinese dragon on his chest, the creature stood tall as a 
powerful cerulean aura surrounded his body. Lovestar stepped forward 
to challenge him until she was held fast by Waterstar. 

&#147;Wait. Before we do this I would like to know who you are&#133;&#148;

&#147;My name&#133;I have been called Wong-lao in the past. Call me what you 
wish. It no longer matters. In a few minutes you two will be nothing 
more than lifeless heaps of pulp.&#148;

&#147;Why you&#133;&#148;

Instantly Lovestar ran forward aggressively, charging at Wong-lao, who 
had just taken on a defensive stance. As she reached him, Lovestar 
flung a fist at the demon mercenary, which he sidestepped easily. She 
again tried to punch him. However with his right arm he blocked the 
move and the force of the deflection pushed Lovestar back a little. 
Driven by fury, the goddess of love and peace let out a flurry of 
hi-powered attacks, all of which the purple titan dodged with minimal 
effort. Then during the barrage of the fists, a very fast punch 
clipped the side of Wong-Lao&#146;s jaw. Three droplets of blood trickled 
down his mouth as he stumbled back, only to be floored by a spinning 
roundhouse kick from the chestnut haired warrior. Stepping back, the 
monster wiped his brow&#133;angrily. Clutching her fist, she stood smiling.

&#147;Ha, ha, ha! I see Sunstar&#146;s training is kicking into effect.&#148;

&#147;How&#133;dare you&#133;you little brat!!!&#148;

Without warning, Wong-Lao fired a wave of energy with enough force to 
blow away Lovestar. Being flung away and hurled into a patch of dirt 
Lovestar screamed in pain and agony. 

&#147;Yai!!!&#148;

The demon then ran towards her while she writhed in pain, clutching 
her ankle. Then as he leered over her limp body, the demon mercenary 
was hit with a great thud, and hurtled into a near-by park bench. 
Meekly, Lovestar opened her eyes and saw Waterstar standing above her, 
a pillar of strength.

&#147;She rescued me&#133;oh Keiya&#133;&#148;

Turning her head quickly, she monitored the Goddess of Love and 
peace&#146;s body. 

&#147;Lovestar&#133;are you alright? Are you hurt?&#148;

&#147;&#133;No problem&#133;you know me Waterstar, I&#146;m tough as a&#133;aaahhh!&#148; 

As Yai stood, she put pressure on her leg and tumbled to the ground 
and yelped once again in fit of pain. Waterstar bent down and took a 
look at her ankle. It had been beaten badly by the fall. It seemed as 
if it were broken. 

&#147;You&#146;ve hurt your ankle. Don&#146;t worry I&#146;ll get you out of here. But 
there is something I need to take care of first.&#148;

&#147;&#133;No&#133;you cant fight him alone&#133;it&#146;s too dangerous.&#148;

The goddess of the sea flashed a defiantly brilliant smile at the 
bruised warrior.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry. I can handle myself&#133;and I&#146;ll protect you.&#148;

&#147;Waterstar&#133;&#148;

To the far right, Wong-Lao stood, he clutched his head and shook away 
the pain. And began to dust off his body. As he looked forward toward 
Lovestar, he saw Waterstar, standing defensively in front of her.

&#147;I must admit, your friend over there caught me off guard&#133;but you 
little girly-girls have no strength. Nothing you have is a match for 
me&#133;I can&#146;t believe Tanzanite was so afraid of you, he&#146;s even weaker 
than I thought!&#148;

&#147;&#133;Don&#146;t underestimate us.&#148;

&#147;Sorry girly&#133;weaklings like you can&#146;t. Beat. Me!&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;Huh?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Crystal Frozen Fraction!!!&#148;

From Waterstar&#146;s clutched palms fired a large sphere of shining blue 
energy. The ball blasts the demon mercenary with unrelenting force, 
hurling him into the far ground. Running across the wet grass with 
indescribable speed, Waterstar lunged forward at the demon and lad 
waste to him with blow after angry blow, yelling with the ferocity of 
the mighty lion as the impact of each blow sent ripples on energy 
throughout the park. A final punch to the face of the dazed Wong-Lao 
and he fell to the ground on one knee.  Instantly, the goddess of the 
sea leaped into the air and fired another Crystal Frozen Fraction at 
him, which he was unable to dodge, and the sheer force of the death 
sphere shattered the earth around him, creating a considerable crater 
and leaving a smoked out Wong-Lao at it&#146;s epicentre. Waterstar then 
landed gracefully as she watched the writhing form of Wong-Lao with a 
face rigid with hatred and disgust. Slowly she clutched her palms to 
finish it off, however, she was struck with a sense of worry as she 
turned around to face Lovestar.

&#147;Lovestar&#133;are you ok?&#148; Waterstar asked concernedly. 

Lovestar shook her head a little and opened an eye at Waterstar. 
&#147;&#133;I&#133;yes&#133;what!? Look!&#148;

As Waterstar swerved her torso to see what she was talking about; 
Wong-Lao had crawled out of the crater, his body matted with sweat and 
dirt. Intense anger filled his heart as he gazed upon the goddess of 
the sea. Standing defensively and staring intently, Waterstar readied 
herself.

&#147;&#133;Maybe your right&#133;I did underestimate you. However I will return&#133;and 
I will destroy you&#133;&#148;

With that, Wong-Lao leapt over the nearby trees, and left. Turning 
back to Lovestar. She bent down and spoke to her.

&#147;Lovestar listen to me. We need to get you home.&#148;

&#147;Shouldn&#146;t I go to a hospital or a surgery for this?&#148;

&#147;No. Our powers allow us to heal things a little faster than normal 
humans. We need to draw as little attention to ourselves as possible.&#148;

&#147;Ok. Thank you&#133;&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148; Waterstar said, still monitoring the extent of the damage 
done to Lovestar&#146;s ankle.

&#147;For saving me. You rescued me. Thank you.&#148;

Waterstar looked at Lovestar intensely, and the sudden change in her 
eyes suddenly made Lovestar feel a little confused. &#147;I told you. I 
wanna protect you. You&#146;re my partner now.&#148; 

&#147;&#133;Yes.&#148;

Smiling gently, Waterstar then cradled Lovestar&#146;s torso and legs into 
her arms and lifted her of the wet ground swiftly.

&#147;W-what are you doing?&#148; Lovestar spluttered. 

&#147;You can&#146;t walk on that leg. I&#146;ll have to carry you home. Is that ok?&#148;

Lovestar&#146;s head lowered. &#147;Well sure&#133;I guess.&#148;

Waterstar chuckled under he breath and smiled again. &#147;Just relax. 
It&#146;ll be ok.&#148; 

Blushing gently and smiling unconscientiously, the goddess of love and 
peace closed her eyes and she let herself melt into Waterstar&#146;s arms. 
Strangely, she felt so safe at this point. There was something 
comforting about being wrapped in Waterstar&#146;s embrace. Waterstar 
stared at Lovestar but her gentle smile transformed into a pained 
expression. It was happening all over again. Just like Hikaru. 

Saturday morning (day 1)
 
Yai stirred in her bed as beams of light emanated from the windows. 
She slowly opened her eyes as she felt the warmth of the sun on her 
cheeks. She leaned up and suddenly felt a pang of cold where her 
injured ankle was. She pulled her blanket over to see an ice pack 
rapped around the bruised ankle. She didn&#146;t attempt to move it, lest 
she cause it any more unnecessary damage. She then closed her eyes and 
lay back, only to be arisen by a rap on the door. 

&#147;Yai? It&#146;s me. I brought you some breakfast.&#148;

&#147;Keiya? Come in.&#148;

Keiya opened the door and entered. She had made a full breakfast, 
which Yai was more than pleased to see. She set it down on the table 
next to the bed, and sat beside Yai. 

&#147;So how are you feeling? You took a ruff blow.&#148;

&#147;I feel fine, really. Aside from this ankle. Arrh!&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Keiya said, innocent curiosity flavouring her voice. 

&#147;I was completely useless in that battle. I was so weakened I needed 
you to save me. I feel so pathetic.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t think that way. I need you now more than ever. Don&#146;t forget 
that you&#146;re just beginning. It&#146;s only been a couple of weeks since 
you&#146;ve been awakened. You can&#146;t rush it. Alana and I are here for you 
until you learn how to control your powers.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right. I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

Keiya smiled a little, and shifted her legs a bit. Almost bashfully. 
&#147;You don&#146;t have to be sorry. Just don&#146;t be so hard on yourself.&#148;

&#147;Keiya. She&#146;s so sweet.&#148;

&#147;Listen Yai we need to bandage that ankle. It should heal in a few 
days, but you need to be careful and not aggravate it.&#148;

&#147;So you&#146;re gonna do it now? But what about my&#133;&#148;

&#147;You can eat it in a minute silly!&#148;

Yai simply laughed and lay back as Keiya pulled over the cover and 
removed the ice pack. Then with a gently firmness, she slowly massaged 
the offending ankle. Yai revelled the pleasurable feeling of the lilac 
haired starlet&#146;s skilful hands. It sent sensations through Yai&#146;s body, 
of which she had never experienced before. It wasn&#146;t so much of what 
was happening, but of who was doing this. Keiya&#146;s touch possessed 
strength of beauty, which couldn&#146;t be described.   Something so 
amazing it was unimaginable. Yai let out a strangled cry of pleasure 
as she felt Keiya&#146;s fingers relieve her pain. Keiya stopped her 
actions and stared at Yai quizzically.

&#147;Am I hurting you?&#148; 

&#147;&#133;No&#133;please&#133;continue.&#148;

&#147;Sure.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s so amazing&#133;Keiya.&#148;

Sunday (day 2)

Yai was carefully walking up the stairs towards her bedroom. Keiya had 
told her not to put pressure on her leg and was sure she didn&#146;t want 
her to walk around too much.  But she probably wouldn&#146;t find out 
anyway. As soon as she thought about Keiya, a smile crossed her lips. 
Recently Keiya had been avoiding her, especially at Friday night&#146;s 
dance. But now Yai was hurt, Keiya started to care for her and spend 
time with her. She liked it. For the first time she had seen Keiya&#146;s 
caring, considerate side. A side of her, which she had never seen 
before. She now felt so secure with her. So safe and cared for. In a 
way, she would have preferred it if the ankle didn&#146;t heal so quickly, 
so that she could spend some more time with Keiya. When her ankle 
healed, she knew Keiya would leave and revert to her distant self. 
This thought depressed Yai much more than she thought it would. Slowly 
she walked up the stairs and turned at the bathroom. She moved as 
slowly as she possible could, so she couldn&#146;t disturb Keiya who was 
taking a shower. 

&#147;Yai? Is that you?&#148;

&#147;Busted!&#148; 

&#147; Yeah it&#146;s me.&#148;

&#147;I thought I told you not to walk on that ankle!&#148;

As Keiya stepped out of the bathroom and spoke, Yai&#146;s eyes went wind 
with shock as saw her, clad only in a tightly wrapped towel. Yai 
blushed deeply as she was struck by a blinding desire. Her feelings 
went beyond simple admiration. She felt an unmistakable attraction for 
the lilac-haired starlet. She was more then just beautiful... the 
feelings she was experiencing were scaring her, but at the same time, 
her feelings felt so right...

Her cheeks flushed, she spoke;

&#147;I...I just went down stairs to get a glass of water.&#148; Yai said, all 
the while, not taking her eyes off Keiya&#146;s&#133;

&#147;And just where is this glass of water?&#148; Keiya said in mock anger.

&#147;Oh&#133;yeah&#133;well&#133;uh&#133;ha, ha, ha&#133;I guess I forgot it!&#148;

&#147;Ummm?&#148;  A bemused expression spread across Keiya&#146;s face.

&#147;Alright I&#146;m sorry.&#148; Yai stared towards the ground, temporarily 
forgetting about her erratic blushing, thanking herself that found 
something to divert her attention away from Keiya&#146;s body&#133;
 
&#147;Good. Now get back in bed. I told you if you want something, call me. 
Ok?&#148; 

 &#147;Yes&#133;I&#133;&#148;

Keiya seemed cheery enough, but she became more curious and confused 
as looked at her Chestnut haired friend. She was acting weirdly&#133; 
Keiya&#146;s searching eyes observed Yai with a little concern. Yai was 
blushing like crazy, although she had no reason to, and she was 
staring at the ground like the very chasm of hell had opened up and 
threatened to swallow her whole. Her demeanour was almost&#133;bashful, and 
in a sense&#133; nervous. It wasn&#146;t like Yai to be acting this strangely.

&#147;Something wrong Yai?&#148;

&#147;&#133;I&#133;I just need some rest. That&#146;s all.&#148;

Slowly Yai walked towards her bedroom. After closing the door, she 
leaned back and willed her heart to stop pounding. There was no 
mistaking it. Yai Kitana was in love.

**********

Sunday night, 10.22

Yai had had a troubled day. The sight of Keiya&#146;s body in that fashion&#133; 
the fact that she couldn&#146;t control the war drums thundering in her 
chest&#133; Keiya&#146;s new attitude towards her. At first Yai wanted to be 
closer to Keiya, as friends should be, but now things were changing. 
Keiya&#146;s friendship wasn&#146;t her concern anymore. She didn&#146;t want to be 
just her &#145;friend&#146;. Not now at least. Chills ran down her spine when 
she realized the truth. Yai wanted so much more. Yai&#146;s sweaty, hot and 
tired body twisted around in her bed, as she clutched at the thin 
fabric of the bedspread. Her eyes were closed but she couldn&#146;t sleep. 
It had been like this for the past twenty minutes. Things seemed to be 
falling out of perspective for her, and the loss of sense in her life 
was changing everything. Every couple of seconds Keiya&#146;s sweet, 
smiling angelic face kept popping into her head, only to be answered 
by wistful smile crossing Yai&#146;s face, and a lovelorn sigh escaping her 
throat. Not soon later, Yai would violently shake these thoughts out 
of her head. Thoughts of Keiya&#133; so beautiful and pure&#133; charming and 
sweet, calm, kind, considerate&#133; so&#133;beautiful&#133; Yai shook her head 
again; eyes forcing themselves open as she jerked up. In a sense, she 
hated this. This &#133; feeling&#133; it scared her&#133; but yet, it felt so right&#133; 
why was this happening? 

&#147;Oh god. I can&#146;t sleep. I want to but I can&#146;t&#133; what&#146;s happening to me? 
I&#146;ve never felt like this before. Not about another woman&#133; and never 
at this magnitude&#133; all I wanted was to be Keiya&#146;s friend. Her friend 
and only her friend&#133; but now&#133; I don&#146;t understand it! When I saw Keiya 
this morning, wrapped in nothing but a tight towel, her soft lilac 
hair cascading down her face, I couldn&#146;t control what I felt! I&#146;ve 
never looked at a woman in that light before&#133;am I in love with&#133; no, 
that&#146;s nuts. How could I be in love with Keiya, I just met her a 
couple of weeks ago. But is it so farfetched? I did almost kiss her 
the day we met&#133; But Keiya said that didn&#146;t mean anything. Does she 
believe that? Now that I think about it that might have been a cover. 
That would explain why Keiya acted so weirdly when I told her about 
Akira. And Keiya avoided me after that. Were her feelings hurt? No 
that&#146;s just wishful thinking&#133; wait a minute? What am I wishing for? I 
don&#146;t like Keiya that way! She is just my friend! That&#146;s all she is&#133; I 
have to believe that. But it doesn&#146;t explain what is happening to me. 
I&#146;ve always imagined what it would be like if I met the one&#133; 
everything I feel now was what I expected to happen&#133; but Keiya cant be 
the one for me. That&#146;s what my rational mind tells me. But my 
impulsive heart tells me otherwise&#133; when we almost kissed, I did want 
it. In that split second I saw Keiya&#146;s crystal blue eyes gazing into 
me&#133; I just wanted so much to kiss her. Now that I think about it, I 
ran away from her because of the shock of it all, not because I was 
afraid or fearful. Not even because it repulsed me. Far from it. I 
wanted her so much then&#133; and then there was Shingo. I don&#146;t know if it 
was jealousy or protectiveness that fuelled me, but when I saw Shingo 
and Keiya kiss each other&#133; I felt the need to go over there and stop 
it. I couldn&#146;t stand him holding her like that. It made me feel awful, 
knowing that she was wrapped in his embrace&#133; not mine. And then things 
changed. When I got hurt, Keiya was there, defending me, protecting 
me. She wouldn&#146;t let that guy hurt me anymore. She was by my side in a 
flash, and strangely enough, I don&#146;t think I have ever been as happy 
as I was to see Keiya worry about me. That&#146;s selfish I know, but to 
see genuine compassion and caring in her eyes&#133; especially since Keiya 
has gone out of her way to avoid me for so long I&#133;I couldn&#146;t help but 
feel happy. Now this ankle will heal soon. Keiya will leave, and go 
back to her old ways&#133; avoiding me&#133; ignoring me. I can&#146;t have that. I 
don&#146;t want to lose her! Not now&#133; now that I feel this way about her. I 
can&#146;t take this! My mind is telling me that I don&#146;t love her, that she 
is merely a girl along that narrow path of life. But if that&#146;s true 
then why does simply thinking about her make me so happy?! Why does 
the idea of Keiya exiting my life fill me with such dread, I can 
barely contain it?!  Everything about her&#133; I&#146;m in love with everything 
about her. Her gracefulness, her charm, her kindness, her innocent 
purity&#133; everything&#133;it&#146;s true isn&#146;t it? I can&#146;t really get my head 
around it but it&#146;s true&#133;I am falling in love with Keiya&#133;&#148;

Yai&#146;s eyes opened widely when it hit her. She was in love with Keiya. 
The next hour Yai got a little sleep. But she still found that she had 
trouble sleeping. Keiya&#146;s face still kept popping into her head. The 
sweet sense of loss pervaded her body. She didn&#146;t really know why, but 
she felt she had to see Keiya for a couple of minutes. Just a couple&#133; 
As soon as the idea came to her head Yai meekly stood, and ambled 
towards the door, opening it slowly, so the creak wouldn&#146;t wake Keiya 
(who happened to be a light sleeper) and headed towards her door. Ever 
so gently she grabbed the doorknob, and carefully twisted it to gain 
entry into the spare room Keiya was sleeping in. and there she was. 
The sudden pounding of her heart went unnoticed this time, as Yai 
looked across to the woman lying on that bed. Keiya herself was 
sleeping lightly, in only a large sweatshirt, wrapped in the blue and 
white striped bedspread, under a shower of moonlight, emphasizing the 
beautiful frame of her angelic body. Yai felt a will overpower her. 
Part of her said &#147;you&#146;ve seen her, so go back to your room, before she 
wakes up.&#148; Another part of her called out and said, &#147; Just walk over 
to her and make sure she&#146;s okay&#133;&#148; and wouldn&#146;t you know it, she 
listened to the latter. It told her what she wanted to hear. Yai 
walked across the room towards Keiya slowly, as if not to disturb her, 
but in reality, the beauteous creature before her transfixed her. Even 
in a big sports sweatshirt Keiya had those stunning good looks. How 
does she do that? Yai wondered. As she reached the bed, Yai kneeled 
down to the ground, and observed the lilac haired girl in her sleep. 
Yai smiled dreamily at her. 

&#147;I could do this for an eternity&#133; just let me be near you.&#148; Yai 
thought.

Keiya shivered a little, eliciting a frown from Yai almost 
immediately. The lilac haired girl shivered again, a little cold 
obviously, so Yai pulled the blanket up higher over Keiya&#146;s body, and 
the girl returned to a peaceful slumber. Yai smiled again, but seemed 
surprised as Keiya&#146;s head turned towards her face, so close she could 
feel Keiya&#146;s warm breath on her. Yai was just about to leave, but 
Keiya&#146;s close proximity attracted her.  The chestnut haired girl 
raised her hand to Keiya&#146;s forehead, and brushed some stray strands of 
hair out of eyes. Almost without thinking, she let the back of her 
hand slide down Keiya&#146;s cheek, and she gently stroked the sweet tender 
flesh that lay there&#133;

&#147;I&#133; I&#146;ve got to be nuts&#133; god I wanna kiss her&#133; I want this&#133; so much. I 
need you Keiya Shindo&#133;&#148;

Yai, so smitten, couldn&#146;t help herself. Slowly, Yai moved her head 
towards Keiya&#146;s cheek, moistening her soft lips with her tongue, and 
gently, ever so gently, kissed Keiya on the cheek. Yai didn&#146;t 
immediately stop, but lost her train of thought, simply by the feeling 
of sweet desperate lips, pursed on cool, smooth skin. A single tear 
ran down her cheek, when the thought that this might be the closest 
she would ever get to Keiya, stomped through her brain. The chestnut 
haired girl stood, silent, but continuing to look down on Keiya. She 
was about leave again, but her body betrayed once more as Yai 
whispered under her breath to the lilac haired girl.

&#147;I know you don&#146;t feel the same way I do Keiya. I know I can&#146;t compete 
with Shingo and all the other people who want to go out with you. I 
accept that. But I wont stop trying. I love you so much Keiya. I 
realize that my dreams wont come true, but I wont stop trying. I&#146;ll 
love you forever and ever. Sweet dreams&#133; Angel&#133;&#148;

Yai walked out of the bedroom as she finished, and Keiya shuffled 
around in the bed, mumbling in her sleep. About certain people&#133;

&#147;&#133;Yai&#133;&#148; 

Monday (Day 3)

&#147;Hey Alana.&#148;

&#147;Hello Keiya. Is Yai Alright?&#148;

&#147;Ask her yourself, she&#146;s in there.&#148;

Alana stepped through the door and walked over into the living she 
gasped as she saw Yai&#146;s bandaged ankle. 

&#147;&#133;Yai are you alright? What happened?&#148; Alana asked as she sat down on 
the couch, next to Yai

&#147;Just a little scratch, nothing more. So what did you call us for?&#148;

&#147;Well guys, I&#146;ve been looking into this Wong-Lao character and found 
out a few things. First of all, he is an assassin of war. He also has 
a unique ability to increase his strength as he fights. However his 
status is neutral.&#148;

&#147;So then why the hell did he attack Yai and me?&#148; Keiya asked as she 
leaned on the wall across from Yai and Alana. 

&#147;Isn&#146;t it obvious? They&#146;ve hired him to serve under them.&#148;

&#147;So what did he want? There was no way he could have found out our 
location, and if he wanted to draw us out he could have dragged some 
people to him. So he must have wanted something else.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right. And I&#146;ve heard about attacks in that area recently. I 
think that there is a talisman there.&#148;

&#147;So you&#146;re saying we should check it out?&#148;

&#147;Yes. I think it&#146;s wise.&#148;

While Alana and Keiya gabbed on about the demon attack, Yai just 
nodded along. She was too pre-occupied with Keiya to think about that 
right now. The night before she dreamt about Keiya. And now she 
couldn&#146;t keep her eyes off of her. Keiya had spent the last few days 
looking after her, but soon she would leave. That thought depressed 
her even more now, but that wasn&#146;t the only weight on her mind. Not at 
all.

&#147;I hate to admit it but it is true. I am falling in love. I just can&#146;t 
explain it, but Keiya makes me feel&#133;like life can&#146;t get any better. 
Her smile. It&#146;s so dazzling. Her eyes. The depths that those twin 
pools of shining beauty carry are so amazing. Even those goofy love 
songs that mom and dad listen to make sense when I&#146;m around her. I 
can&#146;t deny it&#133;I&#146;ve fallen for her&#133;&#148;

Later after the meeting, Yai and Alana stayed back, while Keiya want 
home. Alana could always tell when something was bothering Yai, and 
today was no different. Yai was shuffling on the sofa, trying to 
gather her thoughts, while Alana was waiting patiently for Yai to 
speak. And at last;

&#147;Alana&#133; I really need to talk to you.&#148;

&#147;I kind of gathered that.&#148; Alana smiled, but grew concerned when Yai 
didn&#146;t smile back.

&#147;This is important Alana.&#148; She said bluntly.

&#147;Sorry. Go ahead.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Well you see&#133;the thing is&#133;I&#146;ve&#133;well I&#146;m in&#133;&#148; Yai couldn&#146;t bring 
herself to say it

&#147;Come on Yai, you can tell me anything.&#148;

&#147;Can I?&#148; Yai looked up, sternly at Alana, startling the blonde. Alana 
shuffled on the seat, and looked at Yai, as if she had asked her the 
stupidest question she had ever heard. 

&#147;Of course you can. I&#146;m your best friend aren&#146;t I?&#148;  Yai looked down 
again. Alana could tell she regretted saying that, but that didn&#146;t 
make it any less hurtful.  As the blonde haired girl waited for Yai to 
answer her, she saw that Yai&#146;s hand was trembling. Like dead weight, 
it hit Alana. Yai was scared. Even when they were kids, Yai always 
acted this way when she had something serious on her mind. She and Yai 
were like sisters and she couldn&#146;t even see that the chestnut haired 
girl was afraid. Afraid of what her reaction would be to this thing 
that was troubling her. But then her shame gave way to surprise. Why 
would she question her friendship with Yai? But then again, Alana had 
been wrapped up in herself and her own problems lately&#133; 

&#147;Maybe I should stop being so selfish and support her. I mean if it&#146;s 
this hard for Yai to tell me what she has to say, it must be really 
important.&#148; Alana thought to herself

Without hesitation, Alana moved closer to Yai on the couch, put her 
hand on her shoulder, and smiled a reassuring smile at the sullen Yai. 
Yai looked up to her best friend when she felt her hand on her 
shoulder, and returned the smile with one of her own. Yai quickly felt 
confidence envelop her.  This was Alana.  Her best friend. She would 
support her no matter what. 

&#147;Well&#133;you see&#133;I have a &#145;thing&#146; for&#133;someone&#133;&#148; Yai began, but she 
couldn&#146;t say it&#133; her name&#133;

&#147;You have a crush on someone?&#148; There was more confusion in Alana&#146;s 
voice than she intended there to be. 

&#147;It is not a crush. I am truly in love with&#133; this person.&#148;

&#147;&#133;It&#146;s not Akira is it?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Then who?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yai&#133;?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Keiya&#133;its Keiya&#133;&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re in love with Keiya?&#148;

&#147;Listen Alana I know it seems strange, but I am truly in love with 
her. She means everything to me. I need her. I know right now you must 
think I&#146;m a freak or something but this is really hard for me and I 
need your support!&#148;

As Yai finished she could feel the tears well up in her face. Soon she 
collapsed into her palms and began to sob openly. Suddenly, she felt 
herself being wrapped in a warm embrace. 

&#147;&#133;Yai&#133;listen to me. I could never hate you. You&#146;re my best friend. 
I&#146;ll always be here for you.&#148;

&#147;&#133;(Sniff)&#133;thank you&#133;(sniff).&#148;

&#147;Oh and by the way, I already knew how you feel about Keiya.&#148;

&#147;What?! How could you?&#148;

&#147;Well it&#146;s kind of easy to tell from the way you act around her. I&#146;ve 
known for quite some time.&#148;

&#147;So why didn&#146;t you say anything?&#148;

&#147;I tried to, but you were not picking up on it.&#148;

&#147;So you mean&#133;your okay with it?&#148;

&#147;Yai. You&#146;re my best friend. If you&#146;re happy, I&#146;m happy.&#148;

&#147;Thank you so much. Alana.&#148;

&#147;So&#133;how did Akira take it?&#148;

&#147;&#133;I&#133;well&#133;&#148;

&#147;&#133;You haven&#146;t told him?&#148;

&#147;How can I?&#148;

&#147;I know it&#146;s hard but he has a right to know.&#148;

&#147;But I don&#146;t wanna hurt him. I still care about him.&#148;

&#147;He&#146;s going to get hurt either way Yai. It&#146;s best to just let him 
know.&#148;

&#147;I know. I will.&#148;

&#147;So&#133;do you know how Keiya feels about you?&#148;

&#147;&#133;No&#133;&#148;

&#147;You need to confront her Yai. She has to know how you feel.&#148;

&#147;But she might not feel the same way. She might not even speak to me 
anymore, she&#146;s barely speaking to me now&#133;I don&#146;t wanna lose her.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s a risk you&#146;ll have to take I&#146;m afraid.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right. Thank you Alana.&#148;
