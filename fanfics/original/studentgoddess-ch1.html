<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 1 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<pre>      Krystal languidly exited her bathroom, towel drying her hair before yawning. She had 
just finished dealing with a crow demon infestation problem at a local warehouse and was she 
pooped! Speaking of poop, that&#39;s all the birds seemed to be able to do and demon poop, mind 
you, was not the easiest thing to deal with.

      Needless to say, she had no mercy on those birds when she exorcised them. Krystal 
tossed the towel in the hamper and sprawled herself out on her bed. She buried her face into 
her pillow and let out a long sigh. She couldn&#39;t wait to sleep and turned out the lights via 
the lamp on her nightstand.

      What our young blonde, blue eyed protagonist didn&#39;t know was that a figure lurked in 
the shadows of her room, elegantly stalking closer to her bed. The woman crawled onto the 
bed, her long brown hair tumbling over as she did so. Isaka let her purple eyes narrow in 
delight as she took in Krystal&#39;s vulnerable, sleeping form.

      Isaka stroked the sleeping girl&#39;s face tenderly before slowly slipping her white 
bathrobe off her shoulders. The demon smiled greedily when she realized that Krystal had 
finally wizened up and stopped wearing a pesky bra to bed. Her little exorcist started to 
shiver, but Isaka pulled the robe down until Krystal&#39;s back was bare to her wanting eyes.

      She descended slowly, letting her lips fall upon the dimples of her lower back, 
teasing them with an open mouth kiss. Krystal responded with a murmur and a writhe. Isaka 
didn&#39;t stop there, but proceeded to follow her spine up to her neck, leaving lingering, open 
mouth kisses in her wake. By the third ministration, Krystal was wide awake, albeit in a 
haze thanks to Isaka.

      &quot;...mmm... I missed you too, Isaka...&quot; Krystal moaned out as the demon ravished her 
bare nape. &quot;You know I can&#39;t stand to be away from you for more than a couple hours...&quot; 
Isaka nibbled on her earlobe, making Krystal shiver even more.

      For the last year they had been together, Krystal was surprised by how fast her 
relationship was progressing and how much she... loved... Isaka. It was a strange feeling 
that she couldn&#39;t identify at first, but once the blonde woman saw Isaka&#39;s tender side, she 
was head over heels.

      ...and Isaka&#39;s seduction tactics were an added bonus, too.

      Krystal moved to get up, but Isaka simply sprawled herself over her back, preventing 
the exorcist from rising more than a few inches off the bed. &quot;Just stay there, Krystal... 
you&#39;re right where I want you.&quot;

      The young woman was about to ask what the demon meant, but she let out a sharp gasp as 
Isaka&#39;s hands snaked around her front to cup her breasts. Krystal tried to stay quiet as 
Isaka teased her, but the demon only laughed at her efforts. &quot;How much do you want this...?&quot; 
Isaka murmured, leaning over Krystal&#39;s shoulder to look into her glazed over eyes. The 
blonde woman licked her lips, ready to-

      The two of them almost fell out of bed in shock when Krystal&#39;s phone started ringing 
violently on the nightstand. The blonde woman scrambled over the side of the bed before 
snatching her phone off the nightstand. &quot;Hello,&quot; she huffed out, clutching the front of the 
bathrobe close, much to the disappointment of Isaka.

      The demon almost had Krystal, but noooooo, her stupid phone had to ring. Isaka loved 
Krystal for more than her body and she&#39;d been doing fine for a few months, but... she and 
Krystal had barely touched second base. She thought they were going to go all the way 
tonight until her stupid phone...!

      Krystal gave Isaka an apologetic look and listened to the voice on the other line. It 
was actually a local police officer. &quot;Hello. I&#39;m hoping this is the right number for the 
exorcist?&quot;

      Krystal let out a small sigh, &quot;Yes, it&#39;s me. Did something come up this late?&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;re afraid so. An abduction occurred this afternoon and so far, we&#39;re quite sure it 
was an act of a demon.&quot;

      Speaking of demons, hers was trying to distract her by sensuously kissing her inner 
thigh. &quot;A-are you sure,&quot; Krystal said, trying to keep her voice steady. &quot;Is there evidence 
to prove that it&#39;s not just a common criminal?&quot;

      &quot;Yes, we are quite sure. I&#39;m hoping you can be here in 30 or so minutes? Just head to 
the wildlife trail right about a block from the high school,&quot; Krystal bit her lower lip as 
Isaka ascended up her leg, her hot breath making contact with her panties. &quot;C-c-can you hold 
on for a minute, sir?&quot;

      Krystal pushed the phone roughly against her shoulder as she tried to break out of 
Isaka&#39;s grip. &quot;Isaka! I&#39;m on the phone and- ahh!&quot;

      The demon just let out a sultry laugh at her Krystal&#39;s reaction to her pulling down 
her panties with her teeth. Unfortunately, Krystal promptly shut her lugs, but not before 
Isaka got a tantalizing view of her precious treasure. The demon was dazed at the image and 
Krystal took advantage of it to finish her talk with the officer.

      &quot;Sorry about that. I will be there in a half hour,&quot; Krystal let out a sigh of relief 
and hung up. She was startled as Isaka suddenly cupped her cheek. &quot;You are so... lovely...&quot; 
The exorcist&#39;s face went red as the demon moved sensuously against her.

      &quot;I-I-I-I have a-another job to get to,&quot; Krystal stammered out, obviously distracted by 
Isaka&#39;s wandering hands. The demon just pouted. &quot;Can I have one kiss, then?&quot; Krystal smiled 
and started to pull the demon&#39;s face towards her.

      However, Isaka wanted to kiss her somewhere a bit lower. Krystal shrieked as Isaka&#39;s 
head disappeared in between her legs. &quot;Isaka! No!&quot; Her protest was cut off as she was pushed 
upon her back and her legs promptly spread apart.

      The demon just stared at sensuous place beneath her. Krystal&#39;s precious flower was 
just asking to be caressed with kisses. &quot;...beautiful,&quot; she murmured under her breath, but 
her trance was shattered as Krystal blocked her view with a hand.

      &quot;Isaka! No! Get off of me!&quot; The shocked demon did nothing as her love tore herself 
away, trying to cover herself with her disheveled robe. An awkward silence permeated the 
room until Krystal got off of the bed. &quot;...Isaka... I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m just not ready for 
that...&quot;

      On the inside, Isaka was suffering from a female version of blue balls, but she just 
gave her an understanding look. &quot;It&#39;s alright. You just need more time.&quot; The exorcist smiled 
sweetly and gave her a long, passionate kiss.

      &quot;I love it when you show me your sensitive side.&quot; Krystal could have sworn the demon 
blushed, but she brushed it off as she changed into sweats and a t-shirt. Her exorcist 
uniform reeked of demon bird poo, so she&#39;d have to improvise. She grabbed up her holy sword 
and felt lithe arms wrap around her waist.

      &quot;Let me come with you...&quot; Krystal couldn&#39;t deny her, especially with Isaka nibbling on 
her shoulder. &quot;Of course. You can probably help me, right?&quot; Isaka grinned happily before 
taking her into her arms. &quot;My way of traveling is much faster than your car.&quot;

      Krystal smiled and clutched onto her. She wasn&#39;t sure when, but Isaka had changed out 
of her skimpy nightgown into a skimpy black kimono that barely went halfway down her thighs. 
The shadows engulfed them and the exorcist reveled in their caresses, so reminiscent of the 
woman holding her. In not time at all, they were a few yards from the scene.

      There were a few police cars parked and some of the officers trotted over. &quot;Ma&#39;am, are 
you the exorcist?&quot; Krystal just nodded and blushed as Isaka wound her arms around her body. 
&quot;...and I am her lover,&quot; Isaka murmured sultrily, causing the officers to exchange looks. 
They didn&#39;t ask.

      They walked over to the scene of the crime as one of the officers explained the 
situation. &quot;Our missing person is Erin Schlange, a college student who came back to town to 
visit her family,&quot; he handed Krystal a picture of the girl. She was reasonably beautiful 
with chocolate brown hair and warm hazel eyes. &quot;She&#39;s 18 and often frequented the rail out 
here according to her family. At approximately 1:30 pm, a woman walking her dog saw here 
walking the other way. There was no one else around and we have no motive, no suspicious 
persons, no boyfriend left behind.&quot;

      Krystal and Isaka exchanged looks. &quot;Are you sure it wasn&#39;t a random attack?&quot; Krystal 
asked and the officer led her to a small path with scuff marks on the dirt. &quot;This is where 
she was taken, but what we found was what alerted us,&quot; The small dirt path that led off from 
the sidewalk led to an enclosure of trees that soon dissolved into a forest. On the braches 
were scraps of red material.

      &quot;We have discerned that the red fabric is consistent with ribbons, but not a natural 
kind. In fact, we think it was something created by a demon.&quot; Krystal cautiously picked a 
piece up and felt a slight jolt. &quot;You&#39;re right. This isn&#39;t man-made... instead it seems to 
be made from a kind of energy, not any kind I&#39;ve seen before.&quot;

      The officers exchanged looks. &quot;Then, we&#39;ll leave this case to you and your,&quot; he let 
out a slight cough, &quot;partner.&quot; Isaka had to stifle a laugh as Krystal turned bright red. 
&quot;Alright, we&#39;ll take care of this and tell you when we find her.&quot;

      After pleasant and quick goodbyes, the two lovers entered the forest path, carefully 
watching the trail of broken branches. &quot;If this demon used ribbons to abduct her, the girl 
was most likely dragged over here and into the demon&#39;s lair.&quot; Isaka just gazed around the 
forest, trying to pinpoint any presence of a demon.

      &quot;Krystal, I find it all quite suspicious. Suppose it was a demon hiding in here... 
This Erin doesn&#39;t seem like a random victim. A demon that devours humans or attacks in 
malice is indiscriminate of what it attacks. It would have gone after pets, young children, 
and other smaller targets before going for a young healthy girl.&quot;

      The exorcist nodded and let out a shiver. &quot;I have a really bad feeling about this... I 
mean, the birds in this forest are unnaturally quiet. Wouldn&#39;t they be rushing out of here 
or singing?&quot; Isaka just gave her a comforting hug. &quot;Perhaps they&#39;re just as worried as us.&quot;
