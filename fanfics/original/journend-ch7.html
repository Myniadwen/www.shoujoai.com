<a href="../original/journend-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        The breeze blew her hair back, the golden mane shining as she 
waited. There was a sound of footsteps behind her and she turned, eyes 
lighting up. &quot;You came,&quot; she murmured.

        He smiled, black hair falling in his eyes. &quot;I promised I would,&quot; 
he said quietly.

        &quot;It&#39;s been a long time,&quot; she murmured.

        &quot;Too long,&quot; he quietly agreed. He hesitated, then reached out to 
gently push a strand of her hair back into it&#39;s place.

        She sighed softly, leaning into the caress. &quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; she 
murmured..

        He stepped forward, cupping her chin as he brought their lips 
together gently....

        Nicole made a face, then saved the document. &quot;I really wish I 
wasn&#39;t so good at writing this sort of thing,&quot; the redhead muttered, 
getting up from her cluttered desk.

        The upstairs office looked much different than when she first 
moved in. The comfortable office chair, the old desk, and her much more 
recent computer and printer were all still there, but the bookshelves 
were loaded to the brim with books. The desk itself was covered with 
papers and files, pieces culled from her earlier books for reference.

        Nicole took a moment to gaze at the view of the sea outside her 
window before sliding the blinds down into place. &quot;I&#39;d better go grab 
some breakfast,&quot; she muttered, still dressed in her pajamas.

        This morning she had been struck with the urge to write, getting 
up early and walking down the hall to her office without even getting 
changed. It was times like this she loved being a writer, the words 
flowing easily as inspiration took hold and a chapter quickly 
materialized on the screen. Even this romance novel was fun, as long as 
she didn&#39;t let herself think about it too much.

        Nicole stepped into her bedroom and swiftly stripped her pajamas 
off, tossing the blue clothes into the hamper. She dug through her 
closet in panties and pulled jeans and T-shirt out, pulling the loose 
clothes on. &#39;Wonder what Laura will think?&quot; she found herself wondering.

        Shaking her head at her wild thoughts Nicole stopped into the 
bathroom to comb her hair and brush her teeth, then she headed 
downstairs. She strode into the living room only to freeze at the sight 
that awaited there. Laura stood by the living room window, the light 
shining across her ghostly form, only wisps of misty material dancing 
around her body. She was beautiful, the blonde haired figure who gazed 
outside with such deep longing. Laura seemed to sense Nicole and turned, 
eyes widening. She shrieked, covering her bare form with her hands then 
promptly disappeared, leaving only a shimmer in her wake.

        &quot;Wait,&quot; Nicole started to say, then trailed off. &quot;What was that 
all about?&quot; she wondered aloud.

        Nicole stood there for a moment, lost to her thoughts, before 
turning and walking on to the little kitchen. It only took a moment to 
dig a box of cereal out of the cupboards and then grabbing some milk 
from the fridge. She sat down at the old table and crunched through her 
meal, drinking some of the freshly made coffee.

        &#39;I set it up last night,&#39; Nicole silently mused as she looked 
down into her cup, &#39;but I didn&#39;t set the timer. I wonder how it came 
on?&#39;

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Laura&#39;s soft voice said. She sounded hesitant as 
she said, &quot;I turned your machine on when I heard you were awake.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Nicole smiled back even as she looked around for 
her ghostly companion. She persisted in remaining invisible, not a trace 
of her ghostly presence visible.

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Laura&#39;s voice sounded a bit firmer.

        Nicole debated silently a moment before asking her, &quot;Did I 
interrupt something, out there in the living room?&quot;

        The curtain on the window stirred, almost as if someone had 
nervously flicked it. &quot;No,&quot; Laura quietly answered, &quot;I just hadn&#39;t 
realized you were coming downstairs.&quot;

        Nicole thought about that, &quot;So your clothes, how you look is all 
a matter of choice?&quot;

        Laura became more visible, a nearly transparent form gazing 
outside. She seemed more comfortable as she explained, &quot;My appearance 
seems to be defined by how I see myself, so my dress mirrors my memory 
of what I wore while alive.&quot;

        &quot;That might explain why some ghosts look so frightening,&quot; Nicole 
mused, &quot;they see themselves as monsters and so become them.&quot;

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Laura agreed.

        Nicole thought about asking her again why Laura had been 
standing there nude out in the livingroom but decided not to. &#39;She&#39;s 
clearly uncomfortable about it,&#39; she thought, &#39;best leave it alone for 
now.&#39; Nicole got up, carrying her bowl and cup over to the sink, rinsing 
them both clean before sitting them in the drying rack.

        &quot;So what do you plan for today?&quot; Laura asked, standing there 
beside Nicole.

        Nicole flashed a smile, &quot;I think I&#39;m nearing the homestretch for 
my romance novel, so I think I&#39;ll put a few more hours in on it.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve been up there working for days,&quot; the smiling Laura 
reminded her, &quot;when have you last been outside?&quot;

        A bit defensively Nicole said, &quot;I went out on the porch for 
awhile.&quot;

        &quot;You may not become as pale as I am,&quot; Laura reached out to 
stroke her cheek, a odd feeling jumping between them as she touched 
Nicole&#39;s skin, &quot;but you need some sun. Why not take a day away from your 
machine and go outside?&quot;

        Nicole felt a blush color her cheeks, though she couldn&#39;t quite 
explain why. &quot;I want to finish that book off,&quot; she said weakly.

        &quot;One day off?&quot; Laura asked gently.

        &quot;All right, one day,&quot; Nicole conceded. She smiled suddenly as an 
idea occurred to her, &quot;But only if you come out with me.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Laura blinked in surprise.

        Nicole smile, putting her hands in her jeans pockets. &quot;I&#39;d 
appreciate the company,&quot; she said, &quot;I get lost in my characters 
sometimes.&quot;

        Laura looked at her searchingly, her blonde hair almost white in 
the sunlight, then she smiled back. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Nicole grinned, &quot;you can show me around.&quot;

        &quot;When did you want to...?&quot; Laura asked.

        &quot;No time like the present,&quot; Nicole grinned.

        Together they walked through the house and out onto the porch, 
facing out to the lane cutting through the trees. The wooden steps 
clunked softly as they walked down, the grass whispering in the breeze, 
soft beneath their feet.

        &quot;This forest had barely begun when I lived,&quot; Laura noted, 
seemingly more solid out here in the sun, the light defining her 
graceful form, &quot;but look at it now.&quot;

        &quot;You don&#39;t go out of the house often,&quot; Nicole realized.

        &quot;I look outside,&quot; Laura gazed back at the house, &quot;but rarely 
venture out myself.&quot; She lead the way around the Victorian home, 
stopping not far from the cliff, the breeze carrying the scent of the 
sea. &quot;I missed this,&quot; she murmured.

        &quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Nicole gazed out at the water, the power of 
the sea out in the distance.

        &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Laura agreed, gazing at Nicole. She reached out, 
fingers lightly tracing Nicole&#39;s, &quot;Come with me.&quot;

        Nicole followed, the gentle tingle of Laura&#39;s phantom like 
fingers drawing her onward. The little hill was clear, the grass green 
and thick, a spot that was almost made to picnic on. Nicole knelt, then 
sat down with a smile, &quot;I need to bring lunch out here one time.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad you like it,&quot; Laura knelt there. She seemed more real, 
almost like a flesh and blood women as she asked, &quot;And would I be 
invited to lunch?&quot;

        &quot;No one else,&quot; Nicole smiled.

        Laura seemed about to say something else when.... a horn blared, 
startling them both. A car had pulled into the driveway, a sleek little 
sports car that looked utterly out of place there. The black haired 
woman got out, thumping the door shut then looked around before spotting 
Nicole. &quot;I got lost twice trying to find this place,&quot; she complained.

        &quot;Rachel?&quot; Nicole blurted out as she scrambled to her feet, 
gazing at her old friend in shock.
