<p><font size="4" face="century"><b>Chapter 1: The New Squire</b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i></font><font size="3"

<p><font size="2" face="century">  Flickering flames danced atop 
melting candles, faintly lighting the crypt where the ceremony was being 
held. Skeletal soldiers dressed in armor made of magically reinforced, 
interlocking bones, stood along the crypt’s walls protecting the precious 
corpses stored within and watching the only two living creatures in 
the entire room.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  One was a young girl, no older 
than fifteen in human years, with long black hair, cold brown eyes, 
and corpse white skin. She wore a black tabard over a two-piece chain 
mail suit, gauntlets, greaves and sabotons of bone. A black nodachi 
was strapped to her back, an heirloom from her mother. She kneeled before 
a cloaked figure, her left hand over her heart and her right atop a 
flesh bound book dyed black. “I, Marrona of the Skullguard, swear 
upon the Necronomicon to uphold and enforce the law written in it to 
punish all who would abuse the art of necromancy for personal gain lest 
Hell take my incompetent soul alive.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The cloaked figure’s face 
was hidden behind the high collar of his tabard and the shadows from 
within the hood of his cloak. Bleached white bone armor peeked out from 
under his cloak, the only white he was wearing. In his right hand he 
held a grim long sword with a skull ornament pummel and ebony scabbard. 
“I, sir lord Cadaver of the Skullguard, with the dead as our witness, 
bestow upon you the title of Necroknight.” He lay flat of his blade 
on each of the girl’s shoulders, first the left and then right, before 
raising the sword into the air and striking the blade into the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>CHK!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
The skeletal soldiers, followed suit, striking the butts or blades of 
their weapons into the ground to confirm their understanding and seal 
the contract.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>CHK! CHK!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
The cloaked man kneeled beside Marrona with hand outstretched. “Rise, 
my lady. We are now equals, knights-in-arms. You no longer need to bow 
before me.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Yes my lord,” Marrona said, 
taking the man’s hand with her own. “Though may I ask something 
of you my lord?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “What is it my lady?” Cadaver 
asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “To never be called Marrona 
again. My knight name shall be ‘Bones’,” the girl said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “As you wish, Lady Bones.” 
The man chuckled to himself.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  A decade passes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  Clatter, clatter.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The Armatra, a magically powered 
passenger train that ran through the Gaiose forest from the southern 
coast to the border between it and its northern neighbor the Dryad’s 
Cemetery, surged down the rails which determined its fate. For Bones 
and her canine companion Marrow, there was no other choice when it came 
to crossing over long distances of the massive forest nation. Normally 
pets weren’t allowed, but the conductor made an exception when he 
saw her badge.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones wore her usual wardrobe, 
a random black graphic t-shirt, black cargo pants and black skater shoes. 
Today’s t-shirt had a skull with a red hourglass on its forehead and 
eight, arachnidan legs reaching out of the sides of the skull. She also 
carried a black messenger bag with the logo of her favorite </font><font color="#FF0000" 
size="2" face="century">band</font><font size="2" face="century">, 
Cemetery Soldiers, on the bag’s flap.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The Shetland sheepdog, Marrow, 
laid at her feet peacefully snoozing. The dog did only three things 
in this world: eat, sleep and bark at anybody who entered Bones’ home, 
but her master wouldn’t have her any other way. The only thing that 
could wake the dog from her sleep, other than kicking or tripping over 
her, was the smell of fresh food.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The train’s hostess entered 
the passenger car that Bones and Marrow were in pushing a cart carrying 
several tasty snacks, rousing the dog from its sleep with a jerk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “You hungry girl?” Bones 
asked, scratching the dog behind the ear. The sheltie looked up at her 
master and barked in answer. “Oneesan, over here please!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The hostess pushed the cart 
down the train, but stopped at the sight of Marrow. “Excuse me ma’am, 
but pets aren’t allowed on the train.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m sorry, but it’s seems 
the conductor forgot to tell you, I’m an exception,” Bones reached 
into her pocket, pulling out her badge and showing it to the hostess.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The hostess’s eyes widen and 
the color drained from her face. “F, Forgive me my lady! I swear I 
had no idea that</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">....Err...who</font><font size="2" face="century"> you were!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “It’s okay. I guess it’s 
hard for people to tell who I am while dressed so casually. Now, could 
we have some food and drink?” the young knight asked with a smile 
that </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">was</font><font size="2" 
face="century"> intended to be comforting, but lacked warmth.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Of course! Whatever would 
you like?” The hostess asked, trying to hide her fear.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’ll have an Evil Elixir 
and Marrow will have some sweet bread. I don’t suppose you would have 
any candy corn?” Bones asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I, I, I’m terribly sorry 
my lady, but, but</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">...</font><font 
size="2" face="century">” the hostess said, stuttering in fear.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I guess not. Then I take 
some caramel cubes. *Sigh*” <i>Damn they come out only once a year 
and I never stockpile enough.</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Here you are ma’am.” 
The hostess handed Bones an unopened soda can and bag of wrapped caramel 
cubes. She hesitantly leaned down to give the loaf of sweet bread to 
Marrow who snatched it out of her hand, causing her to yank it back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Marrow, where’s your manners? 
You never bite the hand that feeds you!” Bones scolded the dog who 
was already scarfing the bread down like there was no tomorrow. “I’m 
so sorry about that, Oneechan! I really need to teach her some etiquette.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I, It’s okay,” the hostess 
said, rubbing her hand gratefully. “Is there anything else I can get 
for you?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “No, thank you for asking,” 
the knight said, opening the soda can and sipping from it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “If you need anything, just 
call,” the hostess bowed and pushed the cart off. </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century"><i>To 
think, that</i></font><font size="2" face="century"><i> girl is one 
of ‘them’…</i> The hostess thought, risking a glance back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones opened the bag of caramels, 
picked out a caramel cube, unwrapped it and popped it into her mouth. <i>
It shouldn’t be much longer before we reach Coton. I wonder what kind 
of incident could cause Lord Cadaver to search me out personally…</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
The night before…</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>Arf! Arf!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
Marrow barked furiously at the intruder, but she was no determent. The 
intruder simpl</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">y</font><font size="2" 
face="century"> passed by without a glance in the dog’s 
direction as it entered the six by ten tomb. Instead</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">,</font><font size="2" face="century"> it headed straight towards the sole 
coffin 
placed in the center. Marrow continued to bark at him, but she was helpless 
to stop him as he reached the coffin and lifted open the lid.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The blade of nodachi pressed 
into his throat. “So we meet at last tomb robber!” Bones said, sitting 
up from within the coffin. She was dressed in only a T-shirt that was 
obviously a few sizes too small especially around the chest and a pair 
of boxers that immodestly exposed her smooth white legs.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “If you mean the man that 
Nev’rmor is cleaning up outside, I fear you’re too late,” the 
stranger said in a voice no louder than a stage whisper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>That voice! </i>
“Forgive me my lord! I had no idea it was you!” Bones hastily sheathed 
her nodachi, her face red with embarrassment.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “No need to apologize, though 
you need to learn how to sleep lightly. You’re still deaf when you 
sleep.” the man said, shaking his head. “You were lucky that the 
tomb robber didn’t slay the mutt or even run.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Forgive me my lord,” Bones 
said, looking away in shame.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “No, forgive me. Even though 
we’re equals, I chastised you. Besides I’m here to ask for your 
help,” the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “My help?” Bones asked looking 
at the man with curiosity.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “A serious of mysterious murders 
has been happening in the town of Coton that has the local law enforcement 
baffled,” the knight said, leaning against the nearest wall of the 
tomb and crossing his arms. “You see there is no question to who are 
the murders, but the problem is that they’re found dead and have been 
dead long before they supposedly murdered the victims.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones eyes grew wide. “You 
don’t mean?!”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I fear so… Somebody using 
necromancy to commit murder without exposing their true identity! As 
you know, the unlawful use of the dark arts is strictly prohibited by 
the Necronomicon, whose rules we, the Skullguard</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">,</font><font size="2" face="century"> enforce. To allow the culprit to go 
unpunished 
would not only put hundreds in danger, but would be an insult to the 
very order! That is why I have been forced to ask you to investigate.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “But why me, my lord?” Bones 
asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I, as you know, bear the 
title of Lord Knight and therefore cannot leave my people without much 
trouble both in leaving and what happens after I leave. I have no delusions 
about being loved by all my people and I know many of who want my position 
or merely oppose the Skullguard. I risk my very positions, much less 
my life, by seeking you out now. I also cannot entrust this mission 
to the green swords; they merely sit about twiddling their thumbs waiting 
for missions to fall into their laps and thereby lack the experience 
needed to take a difficult quest as this. You, who have made a name 
for yourself through taking initiative and hunting down all leads you 
hear detailing possible abuse of necromancy are far more experienced 
and skill for this; maybe a little too much.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “You speak too highly of me 
my lord, but I understand what you mean and will gratefully accept your 
offer.” Bones said bowing to the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “As modest as ever, though 
I must warn you. Because of your actions, the church has grown rather 
uncomfortable. You perform nearly the same miracles they do and rarely 
ask for more in return than you truly deserve where as the Church requests 
pricey donations before they even raise a finger. They are beginning 
to see you as a threat and never once have trusted us necroknights. 
If you let your guard down, you may find that the night mother has placed 
a dagger in your back.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I understand perfectly,” 
Bones replied, unsheathing her sword and looking into its blade.</font> <br>
</p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>Beep</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
“Arriving at Coton Station. Please gather your belongings before leaving. 
Thank you for riding the Armatra.” Spoke a prerecorded voice over 
the intercom.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “We’re almost there, girl,” 
Bones said, scratching Marrow behind the ear. As the </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">train</font><font size="2" face="century"> pulled into the station, the 
knight grabbed 
her messenger bag and Marrow’s leash before leaving the train once 
it pulled to a stop.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Coton was a little town with 
a bad location. Set on the border between the Gaiose Forest and the 
Dryad’s Cemetery, very few every came to this town and the residents 
dreamt of the day they could afford to leave the town. There was no 
tourism and most of the people who came did so only to get from one 
country to another as it was the only area on the border where the forest 
elves and the dread elves didn’t try to kill each other for being 
to close to their country.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Unlike in most towns where Bones 
would received a fair amount of double takes and worried glances, sometimes 
outright hatred or distrust for her pale complexion, the identifying 
feature of all dread elves, the residents barely lent a glance. However 
she also noticed that the atmosphere was far more gloomier. For forest 
elves who were normally calm, quiet and self kept, this was unlike them. 
The sadness, the fear, the despair; it felt like she had passed into 
the Dryad’s Forest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>No wander why mother left 
her homeland. This much dread isn’t</i></font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century"><i> 

right,</i></font><font size="2" face="century"><i> especially for a 
small town like this. Is this because of the murders? </i>
Bones thought, looking at the people.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>RARG!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Oops!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Before she knew, the knight 
was lying flat on her back, the wind knocked out of her body and somebody 
lying atop her with their head between breasts. “I’m so sorry, Inu-chan! 
I didn’t see you down there!” the person said to Marrow as she sat 
up. It was a young forest elf with long brown hair, gentle green eyes, 
and the golden yellow skin of her kind. It was obvious that she was 
a hunter of some sort by the camouflage hoodie and pants she wore, the 
quiver of arrows on her hip and the long bow on her back.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m so lucky that I landed 
on something so soft!” the girl said with a smile, her hands resting 
on Bones’ bosoms. “Why these are so soft, they feel just like bre-” 
Blush filled the girl’s face as her eyes widened in shock. Slowly 
she looked down at where her hands were and then at the confused and 
embarrassed face of the knight. The girl tumbled off Bones with a start, 
kneeling beside her and bowing repeated. “I’m so sorry! I swear 
I didn’t know you were underneath! I swear!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “It’s okay.” Bones said, 
sitting up and brushing herself up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Please, if there’s anything 
I could do for you, anything!” the girl pleaded.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Anything?” Bones asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Yes, e, even if it, it’s 
my body…” the girl’s voice trailed off.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  <i>Her body… </i>
the knight thought, her eyes trailing to the girl’s chest which was 
quite full. <i>Wait! What am I thinking? </i>
“Well, maybe you can help me, but she should somewhere a little more 
private.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Private?” the girl repeated.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “N, Not like that!” the 
knight exclaimed, realizing how the girl was interpreting her statement.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The Black Cat was a chain of 
a cafés that was quite popular in the Gaiose Forest where it spread 
like wild fire. It served an assortment of dishes, but most in particular 
were sweet and chocolaty. In most towns the popularity was so great 
that the customers had to make reservations. The little shop in Coton, 
by contrast, was so bear that Bones was surprised it was still open.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones, Marrow and the girl sat 
at the farthest table they could find in the corner of the store. Bones 
sipped a caramel milkshake and ate the rest of the caramel cubes she 
had got on the train while the girl had bottle of chocolate milk and 
ate a slice of chocolate cake. Marrow on the other hand, had scarfed 
down the steak bone Bones had bough</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">t</font><font size="2" face="century"> for her from the butchery and was 
staring 
at the two women with hungry eyes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Before I ask, why don’t 
we introduce ourselves? I’m Bones and I make a living for myself by 
investigating odd phenomenon.” the knight said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m Shiko Tsuryoshi. I’m 
a hunter,” he girl said, smiling. “Nice to meet you, Bones-chan.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Same here, Shiko-san,” 
Bones returned. “Now-”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Please call me Shiko,” 
Shiko interrupted the knight.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Okay. Shiko-san, I’ve heard 
that there’s been some odd murders… something about the culprits 
having been dead long before they committed the act. I know some things 
about magic, especially dark arts and I was wondering if this could 
be the workings of a necromancer.” Bones said.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m sorry, but I can’t 
help… I just got her</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">e</font><font 
size="2" face="century"> today myself so I don’t know about this 
town… No matter where I go, it seems I can’t escape death…” 
the girl said, looking down at the table sadly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Without thought the dread elf 
grabbed the girl’s hands and squeezed them comfortingly. “But we 
all die someday,” she said in a soft, gentle voice.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “It’s not dying I’m afraid 
of, it’s the dead,” the girl said, blushing as looked at the woman. 
“When I was little, the town’s bully locked me inside a tomb and 
wouldn’t me out. No matter how hard I screamed, nobody would help 
me! I screamed and screamed and screamed, but nobody came… I eventually 
found a hole in the wall large enough for me to escape and, and….” 
The girl’s face paled and her breathing became labored, tears formed 
at the rims of her eyes. “T, they were all dead! Everyone, my family, 
my friends; even the bully! Everyone was dead.” </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones’ heart stopped. The 
memories of years past… walking through the razed village she had 
once called home, crying over the corpses of the villagers. The memories 
vanished as quickly as they came and the knight found herself holding 
the girl in her arms, rubbing her back comfortingly and whispering soothingly 
into the girl’s ears. “It’s okay, you’re not alone.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I, I’m so sorry!” the 
girl said between sniffles. “We hardly know each other and here I’m 
wearing my heart on my sleeve,” the girl said, blushing in embarrassedly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “It’s okay. No matter how 
hard you try to forget them, those memories will haunt you for life,” 
the woman said, smiling warmly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Shiko looked at the knight in 
surprise. <i>Those words… there’s no pity in them. No, those are 
words of understanding. She knows how I feel… the pain, the loneliness, 
the sadness.</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
“Is something wrong?” Bones asked. <i>Everyone in her </i></font><font color="#FF0000" 
size="2" face="century"><i>village</i></font><font size="2" face="century"><i> 
dead</i></font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century"><i>,</i></font><font size="2" 
face="century"><i> could it been him?</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century"><i>  </i>
“It’s nothing…” the Shiko replied, blushing and looking shyly 
away. <i>She’s so beautiful and kind. Her breasts are so soft and… 
Why am I thinking of that! </i>Girl’s eyes grew as large as shields 
and her face turned beet red as the memory of Bones’ breasts appeared 
before her eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Excuse me, but I have some 
business in this town to attend. I’m glad we me and I hope we will 
meet again someday,” Bones said, getting up.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Um, yeah!” the girl said, 
watching the knight leave the café. <i>Why does my heart ache so?</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">The Coton town morgue was hard to miss 
and Bones felt like an idiot for asking for directions. The tallest 
building in the town, it was made of white marble with massive sign 
bearing a black coffin. To its left was the town’s funeral store and 
to its right was the town’s hospital, allowing for great convenience 
between the two businesses though (to no surprise) very few ever wanted 
to go to the hospital.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Marrow heel!” Bones commanded 
the dog that was sniffing an area of the hospital’s wall. Marrow turned 
to face her master and barked. “Don’t give me lip! Heel!” Moaning, 
the dog reluctantly followed the knight into the morgue.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “That was close…” Shiko 
said, lowering a sheet of paper </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">away 
from </font><font size="2" face="century">the wall of the hospital where 
she was hiding. “This is so wrong! If she catches me, I, I don’t 
know what she’d think of me. B, but my heart won’t stop aching unless 
I can see her…” The girl grabbed her chest and looked longingly 
at the door Bones disappeared through. “Of all places, why did she 
go into there!?!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The morgue’s interior was 
just as white as it’s exterior, if not whiter. The reception room 
was quite small, more a hall than a room with little to no actual furnishings. 
Then again, Bones didn’t expect many would want to visit the morgue 
unless they needed to. At the far end of the room was a counter accessible 
through a small door in the counter’s side and a door in the back 
wall leading to where the corpses were stored.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  At the counter stood a young 
forest elf girl nibbling a banana roll. She wore a white nurse’s outfit 
with the same black coffin symbol on her hat as seen on the morgue’s 
sign. Her brown hair was tied up in a bun under her hat save for the 
strands that framed her face. Her cold, brown eyes looked at Marrow. 
“Excuse me ma’am, but animals aren’t allowed.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m sorry, but I don’t 
want to leave her outside; I don’t know what trouble she would get 
herself into,” Bones said, reaching into her bag for her badge.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I, I’m so sorry!” The 
girl cried ducking behind the counter. “I had no idea you were in 
town!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones looked at the counter 
in confusion. <i>Does my reputation precede me? </i>
“I heard about the series of murders and decided to check them out. 
Is the mortician in?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’ll get Choku right away!” 
the girl said, </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">dashing</font><font 
size="2" face="century"> through the back door.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The adjoining room was lined 
with several slabs containing the tagged bodies of the deceased. A number 
of tables were located around the center of the room with trays of medical 
tools positioned beside for performing autopsy. Along the wall where 
the door was connected, there was a small oak desk where a woman in 
a lab coat over scrubs sat writing in a binder. When the girl entered, 
the woman looked up at her, nudging her glasses in place with her forefinger, 
and asked, “Nu Nam, what’s wrong?”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “T, t, the necroknight from 
Morlon is here!” Nu Nam exclaimed.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The woman’s eyes grew as large 
as shields as the color drained from her face. “W, What?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  The woman and Nu Nam hastily 
entered the reception room and bowed. “Long time, no see eh?” the 
woman said, laughing nervously.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Do I know you?” Bones asked 
looking at the woman.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m Dow Choku from Morlon?” 
the woman said. When it was clear that Bones didn’t recognize her, 
she added, embarrassingly, “The girl who kissed the corpse.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Bones eyes glowed with recognition. 
“I remember you now! What are you doing in Coton?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Neco Lee, the Necro-mistress, 
tried to kill me and enslave Nu Nam with her death-dolls,” the woman 
said, sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “You mean that horny necrophiliac 
that collected the corpses of beautiful girls to dress like dolls and 
animate as her undying servants?” Bones asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Yes, no matter where we hid, 
she’d find us so we were forced to ask the Skullguard for help. They 
made fake corpses of us and had them cut up to look like we were murdered 
brutally before escorting us to Coton for our own safety,” Choku said 
sadly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Such extreme measures. Couldn’t 
they just arrest her and force her to stand trial?” the knight asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “They tried, but she had disappeared 
from Morlon. They say her underground ‘play rooms’ were completely 
intact. They were investigating for any traces of magic in case she 
was magicked away before I left the town, but I haven’t heard anything 
from them so I don’t </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">know </font><font 
size="2" face="century">much </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="century">more 
then that</font><font size="2" face="century">. But, more importantly, 
why are you here?” The mortician said, folding her arms across her 
chest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I’m investigating the murders 
that have been happening recently,” Bones said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “I knew it was only a manner 
of time before one of you necroknights would be lured here, but I fear 
it’s for naught. I’ve already spoke with the suspects, if you haven’t 
forgotten I can carry conversations with the dead, but they just repeat 
some stupid riddle over and over again,” the woman said shaking her 
head. “I have spoken with some rather rude corpses before, but these 
guys are just absurd!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “If the corpses are speaking 
in riddles then it’s most likely they are unable to speak outright 
by either fear or by the effect of a spell. We necroknights are trained 
to interpret such riddles. I’d be honored if you took me back,” 
the knight said, bowing to the mortician.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Well, I guess it wouldn’t 
hurt. I don’t mind the business so much, but I don’t like the chance 
that Nu Nam could be targeted by one of these dead assassins,” the 
mortician said, pushing open the door and gesturing for the knight to 
enter.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Thank you. Marrow guard the 
entrance,” Bones said, instructing the dog before stepping through 
the door.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="century">  Once the door was closed, the 
dog lay in front of the door and began to fall asleep.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Nu Nam was too busy admiring 
how well the dog was “protecting” the door to hear the front door 
open silently or see Shiko creep into the reception room, quietly shutting 
the door behind and quickly ducking behind her paper screen, blending 
seamlessly into the room’s walls.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  Choku wasted no time locating 
the door where the one of the suspects from the murders was, opening 
it and pulling the slab where the body laid. A sheet covered the body 
which she removed. “As you can see, the cause of death was decapitation. 
There are no signs that he had put a fight </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="century">what</font><font size="2" face="century"> so ever, so it’s safe to assume to 
either 
the man knew the original murderer or he was never aware of the murderer’s 
presence.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Cause of death is irrelevant 
in this matter,” Bones said placing her hand over the corpse’s head. 
“(Speaking the Soul, Communing the Corpse, Answer my questions in 
Full.) Who killed you?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Charred to the bone, dressed 
in tattered robes, he reaps the mortal sown.” the corpse spoke.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “You see! What the hell that 
supposed to mean?” Choku said, sighing.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="century">  “Charred to the bone…” 
Bones whispered. <i>A hellborn skeleton. He was here.</i></font><font size="2" face="Times 
New Roman"> “Where were you when you died?”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Garden of dead, plot 
of sorrow, eternal rest in a dirt bed.” the corpse answered.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Wait, you didn’t 
tell me anything about that!” Choku cried angrily.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “When did you die?” 
Bones asked, ignoring the mortician.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Dotted sky, heavenly 
mirror, time of rest be nigh,” the corpse continued to answer.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Well I could tell 
you that much!” the mortician said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Thank you, you may 
rest now,” Bones said, removing her hand from above the corpse. “Thank 
you, corpse kisser-san, I wouldn’t have been able to learn this much 
if it weren’t for your help.” She bowed to the mortician.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I only did that once 
and it was an accident!” Choku exclaimed, her face turning beet red.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I wander how Nu Nam 
would react if she heard you refer to her as an acci-”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Slap!</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i>  </i>
“I don’t care how you joke with me, but don’t you dare play any 
damn mind games</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New Roman"> 
with</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> her!!! She’s simple 
girl that easy to upset I won’t tolerate you making her sad!!! You 
hear me!!! I don’t care if you’re a necroknight or about your damn 
laws!!! Cut me down if you like, but I won’t let you hurt her!!!” 
Choku screamed her anger visible in her face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I’m not so zealous 
to uphold every law in the Necronomicon, especially when I was in the 
wrong of the matter nor will I hold a grudge against for defending somebody 
close to you. I can only ask forgiveness and be at your mercy,” Bones 
said.  Though the manner in which spoke lacked any signs of emotion, 
her cheeks (beside where she was struck) were red with shame and her 
eyes reflected her guilt.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Even if I wanted 
to stay angry at you, I couldn’t. Even though I had the right to be 
angry, I let my own anger get out of control and acted without thought. 
For that, I must ask forgiveness,” Choku said, blushing in shame.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I will forgive you 
if you forgive me,” Bones said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “It’s a deal,” 
the mortician said, holding out her hand.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “With the dead as 
our witness,” Bones said, taking the woman’s hand and shaking it. 
“Now, if you would do me the honor of showing me out, I believe I 
have a murderer to catch.”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “This way, my lady,” 
Choku pulled opened the door and gestured for the knight to step through.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “My lady, are you 
alright?” Nu Nam said, rushing through the door. Having forgotten 
the dog laying before her, she tripped over Marrow (who snarled at being 
woken in such a rude manner) fell into the knight’s arms.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I’m alright. Choku 
was defending your honor. You should be grateful to have such a caring 
master,” the knight said with a soft smile. Helping the receptionist 
onto her feet and smoothing her companion’s ruffled disposition, the 
woman bowed to Nu Nam and Choku and departed the morgue with the dog 
in tow.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “She’s quite an 
exceptional woman isn’t she?” Choku said, sighing in relief. “She 
doesn’t let her position inflate her ego and is by far too forgiving.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “She even overlooked 
the fact you bringing me to life was an infraction of her laws,” Nu 
Nam said, smiling. “To think somebody like her can be a necro-”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “WHAT!?!” Shiko 
cried, gasping in shock and dropping her screen. Looking at the surprised 
women who were clearly weren’t aware of her presence, the girl grabbed 
her screen and tried to hide behind it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Um, we know you’re 
behind there,” Choku said, a large sweat drop falling over her head.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Shiko ducked through 
the front door, her face crimson red with embarrassment. Seeing Bones 
nearby, she ducked back into the ally hid behind her screen. <i>H, how 
can this be? What kind of cruel twist fate is this? Oh why is beautiful 
Bones a necrophiliac! </i>Tears gushed from the girl’s in a comical 
fashion as she watched the knight and dog walk off. <i>My aching heart, 
can I really have fallen in love with her, somebody I barely know and 
just found to be a necrophiliac? If this is fate, then I cannot deny 
my heart! I must </i></font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New 
Roman"><i>not</i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i> allow her to continue this 
unmoral 
love affair! I will save her!</i> With righteousness filling her heart, 
she began to stalk the knight from the shadows.</font> <br></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Night had fallen on 
the town of Coton, especially its cemetery where Bones and Marrow strolled, 
unaware that Shiko was tailing closely behind. The cemetery was like 
any other cemetery, a plot of grassy land covered with tombstones, above 
ground tombs and the random memorial statue. For the knight, she breathed 
easily, the dark and grim atmosphere making her feel at home while the 
hunter was doing her best to hide her labored breathing lest she be 
caught as she looked wearily at the tombstones.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  She heard the many of 
a tale of the dead rising from the grave and slaying all in their sight 
and ghosts of the angry deceased haunting the burial grounds cursing 
anybody who entered. The place she walked now was the setting of her 
every nightmare since she was traumatized with the massacre of her town’s 
residents when she was little and the slightest sound mad her jump. 
Neither the knight or the hunter noticed they were being followed by 
two others ever since they entered the cemetery.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Doesn’t this bring 
back memories Marrow?” Bones said, breathing in the cold, cemetery 
air deeply. She ran her hands over the tombstones affectionately as 
though she had been good friends with the people that they represented. 
Following the cobblestone path to the center of the </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" 
face="Times New Roman">graveyard</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">, where a 
massive statue sculpted in 
memory of the town’s founder stood. “Well this should be as good 
as any place else. Let’s start preparations.” The woman dropped 
her messenger bag on the ground and began to undress.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Shiko’s eyes grew 
as large as shields as she watched the knight’s clothes drop to the 
ground piece by piece. Holding up her screen with one hand, she modestly 
covered her eyes with her other hand, though by chance her fingers were 
held apart, allowing the girl to peek through the gap. When the woman 
was stripped down to her underwear and continued to undress, blood began 
to trickle from the hunter’s nose, down her upper lip and into her 
gaping mouth. Deep within the girl’s body, she felt something stirring.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Once the knight was 
nude, she opened the messenger bag and pulled out as small drawstring 
purse.  Opening the pouch, she reached inside with her hand even 
though its mouth was too small to have allowed her to do so. Even more 
impossible was what she drew from the pouch. Pulling forth a shirt and 
pants of black, elastic fabric, she put them on (too much of the hunter’s 
relief and disappointment). She drew next a pair of gloves and socks 
of the same black, elastic cloth which she donned before drawing a two 
piece suit of chain mail, greaves, and sabotons made of bone. To top 
things off, she drew out a black tabard with the insignia of the Skullguard 
on it’s breast to wear atop her armor. Reaching back in the bag that 
impossibly carried all of her clothes she drew out a nodachi sheathed 
with a lacquered ebony saya.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Skiko watched the knight’s 
process of dressing herself with shock and surprise. For such a tiny 
purse to hold so many items of such sizes was absurd. The knight failed 
to stop amazing her as she began to stash her discarded clothes into 
the purse including her messenger bag after retrieving her badge from 
within it. The girl hadn’t seen anything like it in all her life, 
but then again, despite living in a magically sustained world, she had 
never seen magic used for such out of the world usage of magic.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>She’s so awesome! </i>

The hunter thought, clutching her heart that was beating quite rapidly. <i>
Even if she is a, a necrophiliac, I can’t stop thinking of her.</i> 
Releasing a heavy sigh she began to direct her attention to the moonlit 
sky, but the sight of a black, scythe carrying silhouette standing atop 
the statue above the knight, preparing to pounce on her made the girl 
stop. She knew that she warn the woman, but instead- dropping her screen 
to draw her bow and nock a silver tipped arrow from her quiver, chose 
to shoot the assailant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones was taken back 
to not only see the hunter, but to see her with an arrowed nocked. At 
first she thought the arrow was aimed at her, but seeing the girl aim 
above before releasing the arrow, drew her attention to the assailant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The assailant fell to 
all fours, nimbly dodging the arrow while balancing atop the statue 
and keeping a hold of its scythe. Launching itself from it’s current 
pose, it sailed forth towards the hunter and swung the scythe in a killing 
arc.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones wasted no time 
covering the distance between her and the hunter, positioning her before 
the assailant and blocking its scythe with the blade of her nodachi 
as she drew it, forcing the assailant back with the attack. Marrow was 
at her heels, fangs bared and a threatening growl rumbling from within 
her throat and out of her mouth. “Marrow guard Shiko-san.” The woman 
commanded, quickly tossing a thankful nod to the girl, before turning 
her attention to the assailant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The assailant, who now 
was illuminated by the moonlight, was revealed to be a skeleton with 
charred bones, dressed in black, tattered robe carrying a scythe with 
a blood stained blade in its bony hands. Twin pin points lit its empty 
eye sockets leaving no mystery to its source of animism.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “As I thought, a hellborn 
skeleton!” the knight said. “As cool as skeletons are, your kind 
leaves a bad taste in my mouth.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The skeleton cackled, 
“Our lord knew that if we brought enough chaos, we’d draw one of 
you blasted necroknights here!”</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I, I, It spoke!!” 
Shiko said, the color draining from her face. “T, T, The skeleton 
spoke!!!” Her hands shook with fear as she tried to nock another arrow.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “And a little forest 
elf girl too! The o’ holy knight called you Shiko, didn’t she? I 
think </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New Roman">I 
remember</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">somebody crying that name out 
before I killed them, but I can’t remember which. I think it was the 
first town we ever razed under our master’s orders. We didn’t take 
the time to memorize every little village we slaughtered in it or the 
town after, but I think the town was called, Devi!” the skeleton said, 
cackling manically.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Tears streamed down 
Shiko’s face. “Y, y, you… It was you who killed everyone!?! My 
family! My friends! Everyone!!!” Centering her bow on the hellborn 
skeletons skull, she fired the arrow. As the arrow flew glowed a mysterious 
light.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The skeleton blocked 
the arrow with his scythe, but on contact, the arrow exploded with blinding 
light. The skeleton screamed in hideous pain as it backed away. “That 
stung you little bitch!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Soulpiercing silver? </i>
Bones thought. <i>Is she a necrobane?</i></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “You’ll pay for 
that you little bitch!” the skeleton cried, charging towards Shiko.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I won’t you harm 
her!” Bones roared, swinging her nodachi at the charging skeleton. 
Their blade’s clashed, sending sparks flying. Closing her eyes, the 
knight began to chant. “O’ holy night, starlit heaven, turn my soul 
into light!” The blade of the nodachi began to glow a dark, ominous 
light, turning the blade black with the darkness of night. With a war 
cry, she cut through the blade of the assailant’s scythe and cut into 
it’s robes, forcing the skeleton to jump back to avoid a more seriously 
wound.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Transmuting that 
blade into Soulpiercing silver! So necroknights can as easily slay undead 
as they can animate them!” The skeleton said, cackling. Tossing aside 
its destroyed scythe, it waved its hands in the air and began to chant. 
“Sulfuric taste, fiery breath, reduce everything to smoldering waste!” 
In haling a deep breath, it expelled a spray of blue fire at the elves.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Get down!” Bones 
cried, tackling Shiko and pressing her to the ground. Marrow fell flat 
on her stomach and tucked her head under her forepaws. The jet of fire 
struck the tomb that Shiko had been hiding against and reduced it to 
molten marble. <i>An infernal flamethrower spell. Not only is it sentient, 
but wise enough to use it’s immunity to hellfire to caste a spell 
that would normal scorched the lungs and mouth of the caster!</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Your reflexes are 
admirable, necroknight, but how will you slay me if you can’t touch 
me?” The skeleton said, smoking pouring from its mouth. Weaving its 
hands in the air, it began to chant again. “Fiery lush, charcoaled 
flesh, burn everything I touch!” The skeleton was lit afire with the 
same bright blue flames. Everything on the skeletons body and everything 
it touch caught afire and were reduced to ash within seconds. The cobblestone 
path under its feet melt. The very air around it crackled with hellish 
heat.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Shiko-san stay down! 
I will deal with it!” Bones said as picked herself up. <i>A hellfire 
armor spell also nicknamed the fiery suicide spell, only a creature 
born from hellfire could survive it’s unearthly temperature and wicked 
flames. Not even my nodachi, whose blade was folded a hundred times 
and forged in flames nearly as hot as hell itself, would last long without 
melting. I must end this quickly lest this entire cemetery will catch 
fire! </i>Leveling her nodachi to thrust, she charged forward. Seconds 
before she would connect, she raised it in the air, stepping on and 
leaping off a grave stone, launching herself into the air. “Men!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The skeleton caught 
the sword’s blade in its hand, causing it to melt. “Even silver 
melts at my touch!” With it’s other hand it reached out to grab 
Bones.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Don’t you dare 
touch my beautiful Bones!” Shiko cried, sitting up in a crouch and 
firing an arrow at the skeleton. The arrow glowed brightly as the one 
she shot before, connecting with the skeletons outstretched hand and 
exploding in brilliant light. As the light faded, the skeleton’s arm 
was gone.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  However, before the 
skeleton could get the chance to curse the girl, Bones reached out with 
her left hand, channeling a ball of black light in her palm and smashing 
it into its skull, disintegrating the skull while the hellish flames 
engulfed her arm. Pulling her arm back and jumping back, she watched 
as the chain mail and bone armor she had been wearing fell to the ground 
in molten puddles. Even the sleeve of her undershirt was gone. By pure 
luck her armed remained in tact save for some light burns.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The now decapitated 
skeleton fell to the ground, the flames dying as quickly as they were 
born, leaving behind a smoldering corpse that turned to ash soon after 
it touch the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Suddenly, a fit coughing 
over took the woman, forcing her to drop what remained of her nodachi 
and cover her mouth. Pulling the hand away, she that the white bones 
of her gauntlet were dripping red with her blood. <i>I poured too much 
of my soul into that attack. </i>The world began to darken around her 
as her sight got fuzzy. <i>At least I won… </i>
Her thoughts trailed off as it lapsed into unconsciousness, her body 
collapsing listlessly onto the ground.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Bones-sama!” Shiko 
cried, running over to the knight’s side.</font> <br> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Deep within a dark room, 
a pawn fell on its side, it’s top disintegrating. The chest board, 
along with the table it was set on were the few items visible in the 
room.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Uh-oh! Skelly’s 
dead!” chirped a cheerful forest elf dressed in a red Victorian gown. 
She was accompanied by several other elven girls who each was dressed 
like gothic dolls.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I have plenty of 
reapers left to sacrifice. As long as one of them makes it across the 
board, there’s nothing be worried about, right bishop Neco Lee?” 
a man enshrouded in shadows said, fingering one of the bishops on the 
chest board. He sat in a thrown of black velvet and sipped at a goblet 
of liquid that was too thick to be wine.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “So who you were trying 
to find with the Skelly, your majesty?” Neco Lee asked, looking at 
the man.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Nobody. I was just 
wanted to tell the council hi!”</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I, I, it’s all 
my fault… They died because of me! It’s all my fault!” A young 
Bones cried, hugging her hips to chest and hiding within the dark shadows 
of the crypt where her family had been charged to protect. At that time 
she still answered to her birth name</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New 
Roman">,</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> Marrona</font><font color="#FF0000" 
size="2" face="Times New Roman">, </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">and was young 
and innocent, unaware 
of the evils of the world. “He lied to me! He said, nobody would be 
hurt, but killed everybody…. But I was the one who showed him the 
way in so its all my fault! Mother, father, auntie, uncle! Please forgive 
me!” The girl sobbed into her knees.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  <i>Crick, crack</i></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The charred black skeletons 
had found her. Mindlessly they forged forward, reaching out with clawing 
hands seeking to tear the girl apart like they had with the rest of 
the village.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Please stop! Leave 
me alone!” the girl cried out in fear.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  That was when something 
happened that the girl could never understand then; they stopped and 
began to shuffle away. At first she</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New 
Roman"> 
was</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"> relieved, but then 
it struck her; they had obeyed. “Stop!” She commanded, wiping away 
the tears.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  They stopped.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  A grin crossed the girl’s 
face. A joyless, ironic grin. She had lost her entire family and village, 
but now, by some unknown power, could control the skeletons that killed 
the villagers and were in fact once her family. Laughing hysterically, 
she curled up into a ball and fell asleep from exhaustion. “Maybe 
I’ll wake up and find this is a just a bad dream,” the girl said 
before closing her eyes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  She would wake to find 
that was a dream. The dream that haunted her sleep every night, retelling 
how she lost her entire family and village because of her innocence.</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Waking was never easy 
for her. Her body, which had been stripped down was covered in a cold 
sweat. Yet, despite being nude, she was quite warm. Maybe it was because 
she wasn’t alone. Lying beside her fast asleep, equally as nude as 
her and embracing her with a death grip was Shiko. Confusion and shock 
over took the knight, leaving incapable of doing anything other than 
gawking at the girl. Trying to move, she jarred her left armed, sending 
a thousand jolts of pain through her arm and causing her to cringe.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  A light turned on without 
warning, blinding the knight. “You’re pretty lucky. If it weren’t 
for that armor, you would have lost your arm or more,” Choku said, 
standing in a very familiar doorway. “I also usually don’t allow 
the living to sleep on my work tables, but for you, I made an exception.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones looked around. 
The room where she laid was the back room of the morgue. “Um, why 
am I here?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Aren’t you comfortable. 
That girl was opposed to it, but the hospital next door isn’t very 
charitable and since you didn’t have any serious wounds, I thought 
you sleep more soundly with the dead. She assisted to be with you, so 
I had no choice. By the way, she’s the one brought you here,” the 
mortician said.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Is that so?” The 
knight said, smiling at the sleeping girl. “Though, why are we BOTH 
naked?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Well, I tried to 
explain to her that dread elves were also so cold, but she refused to 
listen and stripped naked to try and keep your warm. She seems really 
attached to you,” the woman said. “I made her promise to not do 
anything obscene in my morgue. And before you crack that joke, Nu Nam 
and I never did anything of that kind in here!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I wasn’t going 
to. I need only to have manners slapped into me once,” the knight, 
rubbing her cheek where she had been hit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “So whose the girl? 
I saw her hiding in the reception room earlier yesterday,” Choku asked.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Choku-san, are they 
awake? I made some Ginger milk cur-” Nu Nam said, entering the back 
room with a tray carrying bowls of Ginger milk curd, but ended tripping 
over Marrow who happened to be laying in front of the door and crashing 
into the ground with several shattered bowls.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Shiko woke with a start 
reaching for her quiver which had been removed and strewn on the ground 
with the rest of her clothes. Seeing Nu Nam on the flower, the rather 
grumpy canine and the mess surrounding them she sighed in relief. Seeing 
that Bones was awake, she pulled the thin sheet that would normally 
cover a corpse about her body.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “You were a great 
help back there,” Bones said smiling. “I’m sorry for what happened 
to your family… I knew that he had something to do with it…”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “Bones-sama… I know 
it’s not my place to say this, but can I come with you? I have nowhere 
else to go and I don’t think I can live with myself if we were part. 
Even though we hardly know each other, I, I think I’ve fallen madly 
in love with you,” the girl said, looking away embarrassedly.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I am a necroknight. 
I have a sworn duty to travel about this world, punishing necromancers 
who’d use the dark arts for their own game or the pain and suffering 
of others. Most of my time that I don’t spend in town resting, writing 
reports to the grand council or investigating supernatural phenomenon, 
I’m lurking about cemeteries, tombs and morgues. I can’t put you 
through so much-”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I don’t care! I’d 
walk through hell as long as it meant I would be at your side!” the 
girl said, looking into the knight’s eyes. “Please let me be with 
you!”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “There’s also a 
manner </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New Roman">of </font><font size="2" 
face="Times New Roman">funding. The council don’t mind funding 
my expenses because I serving the Skullguard, but they’d never agree 
to foot the bill for a nonmember like you!” the knight said. “The 
only people to ever receive exceptions are…” the woman looked at 
the girl from head to toe with a scrutinizing eye. <i>She seems pretty 
old to be a squire, but then there’s no exact laws restricting the 
age of a squire. Besides her ability to use soulpiercing silver without 
chanting an incantation would reduce the amount of training I’d need 
to give</i></font><font color="#FF0000" size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i>, 
</i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><i>and her archery is pretty top notch. 
Her body is even… Wait why am I thinking of that!?! </i>

“Shiko-san. I cannot deny you of your devotion, even if there’s 
a chance that it’s misplaced, or persuade you otherwise, so leave 
me no other option. With the dead as our witness, will you be my squire?”</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  The girl’s tear brimmed 
eyes glowed with unimaginable joy as the girl threw her arms around 
the knight’s neck and kissed the woman romantically. “I swear upon 
my very life to serve you my lady!” She said, tears streaking down 
her face.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Bones was left speechless, 
her very ability to think taken by the unexpected kiss.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  None saw the carrion 
crow that had been sitting in a window of the back room as it flapped 
its wings and took flight.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  Days later, in the dining 
hall of a distant castle, sir lord Cadaver sat at one end of the table 
along with the other members of the grand council of the Skullguard. 
Before formal gathering could start, the crow flew into the dining room 
and landed on Cadaver’s outstretched arm.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">  “I have a quite interesting 
report for you, o’ august council!” the Carrion Crow said. “I 
saw it all with my own eye!” The crow regurgitated a perfectly intact 
human eye ball that rested in his open beak. “Lady Bones of the Skullguard 
has made contact with one of the Hellfire Necromancer!”</font></p>
