<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>      &quot;Faye! Really, this is getting out of hand!&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s running. Maybe you should stop and we can talk this out.&quot;

      Erin highly doubted Faye wanted to talk and if she did, it would be with her mouth 
against Erin&#39;s body. They had now found themselves running in a field and Erin was quite a 
ways ahead of Faye... but the red head was catching up.

      This was ridiculous; she was the snake goddess and she was unable to outrun Faye. 
Wasn&#39;t there something she could do? Erin may not be completely in tune with her powers, but 
she had a great idea. She concentrated before an energy accumulated in her palm. She hoped 
she knew what she was doing...!

      Erin put her hand against the ground and let out a yelp as the snake golem emerged 
from the soil. She clung to its head desperately as it rose up. Erin had never been so happy 
to see a snake in her life. &quot;Oh it worked, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!&quot; She 
resisted the urge to kiss the snake&#39;s head when she suddenly heard a voice echo through her 
head.

      &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again, mistress,&quot; Erin looked up and realized the snake was 
actually talking to her. Of course, being the snake goddess, she should have figured she 
would be able to understand what they were saying... &quot;Er, thanks... um, can you take me away 
from here? I&#39;m being chased...&quot;

      The snake nodded, making Erin grip onto it harder before it increased its speed. Just 
when Erin thought she was safe... &quot;Like hell you&#39;re going to escape!&quot; Faye&#39;s shout made Erin 
sit up and she could only watch as red ribbons wrapped around her golem. She let out a 
shriek as it was pulled down into the ground and destroyed, making Erin launch into the air 
before landing ungracefully on her butt.

      Erin sat up to see red ribbons intertwined on Faye&#39;s fingers. &quot;It was a nice try, 
Erin, but I&#39;m sure I&#39;m the stronger of the two of us right now.&quot; The dark haired girl gaped 
at her. &quot;You... you just killed the golem...! What are you?!&quot;

      Faye just let out a sigh. Sometime during their chase, she lost the baseball cap and 
her strange red hair was no cascading down her back. &quot;Seriously. Erin... I wish you would 
remember...&quot; Faye said gently before walking over to her. &quot;And don&#39;t worry, your golem can&#39;t 
die. It just returned to the earth and will come back if you summon it.&quot;

      Erin scooted away before getting on her feet. &quot;Who are you...? I know I don&#39;t have all 
of my memories, but how do you know more about the golem than I do?&quot; Faye just shrugged and 
said, &quot;We can talk later, but I hope you&#39;re not planning on running anymore...&quot;

      The snake goddess gave her a sheepish smile and just as she was about to make a run 
for it... Faye, with a flick of the wrist, entrapped her with the ribbons on her right hand. 
Erin let out a slight shriek as Faye started to drag her towards her. Where did those 
ribbons come from anyway?! &quot;I didn&#39;t want to have to tie you up, like this, but it&#39;s for the 
best. I was hoping to save the bondage stuff for later, but hey, why not?&quot;

      Faye just giggled happily as Erin tried to pry at the ribbons wrapped around her arms 
and her waist. She had finally caught her, so now- Unfortunately for the red head and 
luckily for Erin, the ribbons were suddenly cut and the dark haired girl was carried off. 
&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve got to be kidding me!&quot; Faye shouted looking to see where Erin was carried off.

      &quot;I...Isaka!&quot; Erin said, surprised to find herself in the demon&#39;s arms. &quot;Man, you sure 
know how to get yourself in a mess,&quot; she replied, eyeing the now pissed off Faye. Isaka 
would have happily chatted some more with the 18 year old had Faye not shot a myriad of 
ribbons at them.

      The demon didn&#39;t have to dodge, thanks to her girlfriend. Krystal appeared in front of 
the ribbon and blocked it with her sword. &quot;Isaka, I want you to take Erin back and let me 
stall for you,&quot; the blonde said. Isaka didn&#39;t like that idea much, but... &quot;No! Krystal, 
she&#39;s a lot stronger than she looks,&quot; Erin whined out.

      &quot;I&#39;ll be fine. You guys will just be gone for a few minutes before Isaka comes back 
for me,&quot; Krystal said, turning her attention back to Faye. Isaka let out a sigh as she 
dissolved into the shadows with Erin in her arms. The red head tried to send more of her red 
ribbons after them, but Krystal sent a wave of holy energy with her sword, effectively 
shredding them.

      The blonde watched as the ribbons didn&#39;t fall to the ground as mere cloth, but instead 
dissolved. &quot;I know those ribbons are made from some kind of energy and not cloth... You 
aren&#39;t human, are you?&quot; Faye gritted her teeth, but didn&#39;t answer Krystal&#39;s question. &quot;How 
dare you take Erin away from me! I don&#39;t have time for this-&quot;

      Suddenly the red head grinned. She had a plan. She stared intently into Krystal&#39;s eyes 
before smiling. The blonde started to feel funny... she shook her head and focused. She 
didn&#39;t know what that strange feeling was, but... Suddenly, Faye pouted. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t 
charm you, but it was worth a try, Krystal,&quot;

      The exorcist took a cautionary step back. &quot;How do you know my name?&quot; Faye smiled. 
&quot;Call it a special talent. I also know that you&#39;re in love with that demon and she&#39;d do 
anything to save you, right? The last thing she would want is for her precious lover to be 
caught in a trap. I doubt she&#39;d risk letting me have fun with you if she didn&#39;t come to your 
rescue.&quot; Krystal didn&#39;t like the sounds of this, but all she had to do was stall for a few 
minutes.

      &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Krystal asked, lifting up her sword. Faye rose up one 
hand and the ribbons started to glow. &quot;You&#39;re about to find out.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;You need to go now!&quot; Erin shouted at Isaka. &quot;She took out my snake golem in one hit, 
so Krystal&#39;s in trouble!&quot;

      The demon had brought her back to Abby&#39;s house, but let out a sigh. &quot;Don&#39;t worry. 
Krystal won&#39;t get beat that fast,&quot; she said as she started to sink back into the shadows. 
&quot;Sit tight.&quot; Erin watched her disappear and sighed. At least she was safe, but she had a bad 
feeling. Faye wasn&#39;t evil, she was just a little... crazy. And crazy people did desperate 
things.

      &quot;What happened to your hair?&quot; Abby asked, almost shouting. Erin almost fell off the 
couch in surprise. &quot;Oh, it... it&#39;s a result of being the goddess... erm, my appearance 
changed...&quot; The blonde mother stared and sighed. &quot;Well, so how was the horrible torture 
session that our dynamic duo allowed you to endure?&quot;

      Erin just laughed. &quot;Oh, it wasn&#39;t that bad...&quot; There was an awkward silence. &quot;Okay, it 
was really bad.&quot; Abby rolled her eyes. &quot;If Eveon gets kidnapped, remind me to never allow 
those two to handle it... Seriously, when Krystal saved Mina, the girl ended up being gay. 
They don&#39;t have the best track record.&quot; 

***** 

      When Isaka emerged back into the field, she expected to see Krystal holding off Faye, 
or talking to her, or getting beaten or something, but... The demon felt a shudder go down 
her back. The field was empty and practically unscathed. She&#39;d only been gone a few 
minutes...

      She walked around, trying to find any sign of Krystal. Eventually, her foot hit 
something and she looked down to see Krystal&#39;s holy sword, just lying there. Krystal would 
never abandon her sword. Nor would she normally lose this fast, if lose at all. Isaka picked 
it up. 

***** 

      &quot;Ooh... I think your hair is pretty...&quot; Eveon murmured, running her fingers through 
Erin&#39;s dark green locks. &quot;Um, thanks Eveon.&quot; Abby bopped her daughter on the head before 
saying, &quot;You have a girlfriend and she&#39;s not looking too happy.&quot;

      Eveon rubbed her head before looking at Mina, who indeed had a displeased look on her 
face. &quot;I thought you liked my hair...&quot; The blonde girl became flustered. &quot;Yes, I do love 
your hair... don&#39;t look at me like that, Mina!&quot;

      She hugged her girlfriend before giving her a kiss. Abby and Erin exchanged glances. 
&quot;...don&#39;t you feel weird seeing that?&quot; Erin asked and Abby shrugged. &quot;After dealing with it 
for a year, you get desensitized.&quot;

      It was then that Isaka came back, solemnly holding Krystal&#39;s sword. &quot;...I think you 
were right, Erin. Neither of them were there when I went back.&quot;

      The snake goddess shot up to her feet. &quot;I knew it...! But, Faye wouldn&#39;t hurt her too 
badly... I mean, she&#39;s a bit crazy and she obviously did something drastic, but I&#39;m sure 
Krystal is fine.&quot;

      Isaka set down the sword on the coffee table. &quot;If Krystal&#39;s safe, then she kidnapped 
her to get you, Erin.&quot; The teenager sighed and looked down at her clothes. &quot;I will go get 
dressed. Faye wants to trade, since she knows how much you love Krystal.&quot;

      Isaka blushed as Erin ran upstairs to go find some clothes. Eveon and Mina exchanged 
glances. &quot;Krystal is going to be okay, right?&quot; Mina asked. Isaka nodded, &quot;Of course. Faye&#39;s 
not going to do anything to her.&quot;

      Abby just snorted. &quot;Right. Erin told me she uses ribbons as a weapon. Can&#39;t you 
imagine? Krystal is probably tied up somewhere... and this Faye girl, or whatever, being as 
crazy and desperate as she is, is probably having her naughty little way with your innocent, 
na&Atilde;&macr;ve, virgin Krystal. Well, she&#39;s not going to be a virgin for much longer, I suspect.&quot;

      Eveon gave her mother an exasperated expression while Mina blushed. Isaka felt her eye 
began to twitch as she imagined the scenario. Abby smirked in satisfaction as Isaka shouted 
up the stairs, &quot;Erin! You better hurry up and get changed!!!&quot; 

***** 

      Isaka looked around. &quot;Isn&#39;t this... the temple of the snake goddess?&quot; Erin said she 
knew where she was going and summoned her snake golem to take them there. &quot;Yes. I know Faye 
would choose this place because I know where it is.&quot;

      The demon followed the goddess with a skeptical look on her face. &quot;Really. You&#39;ve 
known Faye for a few days, but it sounds like more than that.&quot; Erin looked at her 
sheepishly. &quot;I... can&#39;t remember everything from my life as a goddess, but me and Faye knew 
each other a long time ago.&quot;

      Erin didn&#39;t voice it, but she was sure she and Faye were more than friends... Isaka 
followed along, looking at the walls and fallen pillars. &quot;This place must have been 
beautiful once.&quot;

      &quot;It was... but time...&quot; Erin sighed and stopped in front of the door to the altar. 
&quot;And I think Faye would be in this room.&quot; Isaka stepped forward and pushed open the double 
doors that had the crest on them.

      When they looked into the room, they found candles to be lit and a figure sitting on 
the throne. &quot;Oh, Erin, you came a lot faster than I expected.&quot; The duo at the door exchanged 
looks before walking in. Faye was sitting languidly upon the throne, a tied up and 
struggling Krystal sitting in her lap.

      Isaka resisted the urge to go whisk her lover away, seeing as it wouldn&#39;t be the 
wisest thing to do. &quot;Alright, why don&#39;t you just give Krystal to Isaka and then we can be 
alone,&quot; Erin said suddenly.

      Faye sat up, ignoring Krystal&#39;s muffled cries. &quot;Really? That&#39;s rather anti-climatic,&quot; 
she said. Isaka just stared at Erin. &quot;Are you sure? You don&#39;t want to negotiate or fight 
or...&quot;

      Erin just looked at them confused. &quot;Um, no. I seriously came here to talk to Faye. She 
wanted a trade off and that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing, right?&quot; Isaka scratched her head and sighed. 
&quot;Don&#39;t blame me if you end up tied to a bed by those ribbons with Faye ravishing you.&quot;

      Erin flushed bright red and Faye lifted up Krystal (still struggling and looking quite 
peeved). &quot;Well, you&#39;ve never been dramatic, Erin... so here you go Isaka!&quot; Faye threw the 
exorcist, who was caught by her loving demon. &quot;I bless your relationship and I hope your 
love shall grow ever brighter.&quot;

      Isaka and Krystal just exchanged confused glances. Faye was a nutcase. Erin smiled at 
them. &quot;Okay, you can leave. I will take my chances.&quot; Isaka shrugged and ran towards the 
exit. The doors shut behind her and Krystal tugged at the ribbon gagging her mouth before 
saying, &quot;Isaka! Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot;

      The demon looked down at the tied girl in her arms. &quot;They... wanted to be alone...?&quot; 
Krystal started to untangle herself from her binds. &quot;We need to sneak back in there. Aren&#39;t 
you curious? I want to find out about them...&quot;

      Isaka thought about it for a minute before holding Krystal closer. &quot;Alright, hang on,&quot; 
she murmured, kissing her as they dissolved into the shadows. 

***** 

      Erin watched as the doors closed and she turned back to Faye. &quot;I think I have it 
figured out now. You&#39;re Faye, the Goddess of Love.&quot; The red head blinked before smiling. 
&quot;I&#39;m glad you finally figured it out. What gave it away? Or did you remember?&quot;

      Erin laughed. &quot;A combination of both... I still don&#39;t remember completely, so please, 
tell me... everything, everything about us.&quot;

      Faye let out a slight groan. &quot;I wish you could remember so I could touch your body...&quot; 
Erin flushed bright red. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

      &quot;No, no... it&#39;s not your fault. I&#39;m sorry; it&#39;s just when you love someone so much... 
it&#39;s hard, especially for me. I&#39;m the love goddess, not the Goddess of Marriage. Love is a 
powerful thing,&quot; Faye said, smiling sadly. &quot;Oh, but you wanted to hear about us, right?&quot;

      Faye got off of the throne and went over to Erin. She grabbed her shoulders before 
pushing the dark haired girl down. Erin sat down and Faye sat across from her. &quot;It&#39;s a long 
story... so I want you to be comfortable.&quot;
