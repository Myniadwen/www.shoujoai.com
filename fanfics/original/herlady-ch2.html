<h1>Her Lady (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/13thknight.html">The 13th Knight</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/herlady-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>As quickly as she could, Kara rolled off of the knight, blushing 
furiously. Standing up, she started to apologize, &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I thought 
you were a bandit, and, and...&quot; She trailed off, as she noticed the 
knight was laughing heartily at her while he was trying to get to his 
feet. Unfortunately, the combination of his armor and the intense 
laughter made him fall back onto his backside. Thoroughly embarrassed by 
now, she continued, &quot;And, ah, I&#39;m please to meet you, Sir Bard... I 
think.&quot; 

Rolling over onto his belly, the unhelmed knight pushing himself to his 
knees. From there, he easily got to his feet. When he turned, she was 
once again struck by how handsome he was... She blinked, as he took the 
dagger from her hands. &quot;Nice... Wonderful workmanship, excellent 
balance, perfect for throwing or stabbing... Good Damascus Steel, too.&quot; 
Ignoring her rather unintentionally, he studied the dagger intently.

Profusely blushing, and insulted by his behavior, the young lady simply 
stood there, waiting for him to finish with the dagger and take notice 
of her again. &#39;How... utterly rude! Looking at a dagger while I&#39;m trying 
to introduce myself!&#39; After a few minutes of looking at the dagger, the 
knight calmly reversed the blade and handed back the dagger. He grinned, 
&quot;Sorry about that. I&#39;m somewhat of a weapon connoisseur.&quot; Then, noticing 
her furious facial expression, he said, &quot;Oh! Where are my manners?&quot; 
Rubbing the back of his head sheepishly, Bard began an apology, &quot;Sorry 
about scaring you like that. I didn&#39;t think your servant would tell you 
I was a bandit, even if my armor was covered up by my travel cloak.&quot; He 
grinned again. &quot;Then again, most ladies I know would have only been 
frightened out of their wits. I&#39;ve never actually been attacked by one.&quot;

Blushing and looking away, she mumbled softly, &quot;Well, I did think you 
were a bandit...&quot;

Still grinning, Bard patted her on the shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. 
It&#39;s a compliment. Now, since I&#39;ve already stopped you, why not go ahead 
and break camp here for the night? The gates of Mysidia will be closed 
by the time you get there, and I&#39;ve never heard of them opening them 
back up for anyone less than Royalty.&quot;

&quot;O-okay, I guess, but where will you sleep?&quot; Handsome as he was, there 
was no way Kara was going to let him sleep in her carriage. She wouldn&#39;t 
even allow Jark to sleep in there; he was stuck sleeping on top of the 
carriage in a sleeping bag, or, if it rained, underneath the carriage. 
Fortunately for him, it hadn&#39;t rained yet on their trip.

Nodding at his horse, the youthful knight replied waving his hand to the 
left, &quot;I&#39;ve got a sleeping bag over there, and it doesn&#39;t seem likely 
that it&#39;ll rain tonight. In fact, a nice campfire&#39;s all I&#39;ll need, and I 
can start that right now.&quot; With a simple, &quot;I&#39;ll be back later,&quot; the 
brown-haired lad leaped onto his horse and rode away. 

Kara was surprised at the knight&#39;s sudden departure. Usually, there was 
a bit of a lingering process after you meet new people... Blinking 
several times slowly, she turned back to the carriage. Jark was there, 
carefully taking down the camping items and her bags from the roof, 
where they were strapped in for travel. Walking carefully now, so as not 
to get the hem of her silken dress dirty (Ignoring the fact that the 
front was covered with dirt), she approached her elderly servant and 
took the bag he was currently holding. &quot;Let me help you.&quot;

Nodding, albeit reluctantly, Jark took another bag down, the cooking 
stuffs, and passed it down to her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, my lady, that I didn&#39;t 
give you the all-clear signal. I offer no excuses, only my apologies.&quot; 
Ashamedly, his steel-gray eyes looked down at hers.

Shaking her head, she quickly replied, &quot;No, no, Jark, it isn&#39;t your 
fault. You didn&#39;t know he was a knight. Neither did I, until I hit that 
armor of his.&quot; Rubbing her shoulder as inconspicuously as she could, the 
lady thought to herself, &#39;Not to mention I&#39;m going to have a bruise for 
days.&#39;

Pausing as he handed Kara another bag, a thoughtful expression mixed 
with an amused twinkle in Jark&#39;s face bloomed in the elder man. &quot;Well, 
it was rather funny to see you tackle him...&quot;

Giggling, she lightly punched him on the arm. &quot;Hey!&quot;

Chuckling, the older man hopped off of the carriage&#39;s foothold with the 
last bag in his hands. &quot;Well, if we&#39;re gonna stay the night here with 
that knight, why don&#39;t we break out the last of our flour and niceties, 
and you can bake up some of your biscuits!&quot;

She frowned. &quot;Biscuits? I can&#39;t cook biscuits, Jark. Last time I tried, 
they came out as black as Papa&#39;s beard.&quot; Jark merely looked at her 
expectantly, &quot;What? I already told you, I couldn&#39;t cook... Oh!&quot; 
Giggling, she nudged him with her elbow. &quot;They&#39;re called cookies, Jark! 
Not biscuits! But, yes, that&#39;s a great idea.&quot; &#39;Perfect, too, to 
apologize for attacking Bard...&#39;

Later, all three were gathered around a blazing campfire, the wood it 
was feeding off of having been gathered by Bard. The pale moon shone 
brightly overheard, making the landscape both gleam with silver and 
dance with shadows. Even the knight&#39;s horse was silver, looking almost 
like a mythical unicorn. The campfire too, contributed to the scene, 
cackling and burning merrily, showering the travelers with warmth and 
casting a soft orange glow about itself.

Though, truth to tell, they really didn&#39;t notice.

Jark and Kara simply sat there; gawking at their companion as Bard 
busily shoveled food into his mouth. &quot;Glmph mmph, great! Snarf, Totally 
awesome! I&#39;ve never had cookies this *Crunch* good!&quot; Trying to talk 
about eat seemed a particular ability of Bard&#39;s; Somehow, every single 
word of his came out as clear as if he spoke without food in his maw. 
&quot;Glmph, ah! That was tasty! Though, cookies do make one thirsty... I&#39;ll 
be back; I remember a stream only a minute or two away. No need to drain 
the canteens!&quot; Grinning at his newfound comrades with bits of cookie in 
his teeth, the young warrior jumped to his feet and bounded off into the 
shadows. For a moment, there was no sound but that of the fire, and the 
much louder sound of a large figure in armor clanking off in a seemingly 
random direction. 

Then, Kara turned towards Jark, her eyes wide with shock. &quot;I-is he 
human?!&quot;

Gulping, the bug-eyed older man replied, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen another human 
being eat like that. Not ever Baron Dral.&quot; In an attempt to regain his 
composure, he took a handkerchief and dabbed his brow. &quot;Well, we 
certainly can say that he has a healthy appetite. Just as well that 
we&#39;re going to be at Mysidia tomorrow. I doubt we have enough to feed 
him much more than a single meal. 

&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot; Almost unnoticeably, the young lady shivered softly. The 
young knight was handsome (quite cute in her mind) and she had begun to 
get the slightest bit of a crush on him. But... &#39;He eats like a starved 
snow leopard...&#39; she thought. 

With a slight sigh, she laid back and look up at the stars that 
gracefully adorned the night sky. &#39;Eiyaaahhh... The sky is beautiful 
tonight...&#39; Smiling at the sense of peace that the sight gave her, the 
young maiden started to trace the heavenly constellations in her mind. 
There was the great Fox, most wide known of all the constellations, with 
the Three Hounds always at his heels, ever chasing him across the sky. 
There was also Odin, the great warrior king who had never died, but had 
arisen to the Heavens as a shining star to guide future heroes and 
wanderers. Indeed, the current King of Damcyan, Edward De La Fere, had 
used it as a guide to lead him to victory in the Great Goblin War of 
46&#39;. Oddly enough, however, the blazing Sapphos dwarfed Odin that night. 
Sapphos was, traditionally, the Damcyan goddess of women, and the 
Mysidian goddess of romance. It was a powerful omen whenever any 
constellation or star outshone Odin. &#39;Very powerful...&#39; though Kara, 
&#39;Something to do with Sapphos is afoot. Ah, well... It&#39;s no omen to me. 
I wonder whose omen it really is...?&#39;

Heaving a deep sigh of both relaxed and bored nature, she slowly closed 
her eyes to the world. She knew she should go back to the carriage 
before she fell asleep, but the carriage was cold, and it was so warm 
here by the fire... Slowly, her breathing stilled, becoming no more than 
a gentle lifting and lowering of her chest. Her limbs were made of lead, 
and the day&#39;s traveling and events came back with a vengeance, making 
all the more obvious the aching bruises from tackling Bard. Sleep was 
irresistible, so she simply let herself fall into its comforting 
embrace. &quot;So.... *Yawn* Sleeeeeppyy....

~The Last Call, a bar in Mysidia~

Groaning, a dark brown haired lass slumped dejectedly on the table. Her 
cup slipped out of her hands and fell to the table with a clatter. This 
drew the attention of her two tablemates, one a brunette with longer 
hair, and the other with an odd mix of brown, blonde, and red hair. 
&quot;Ugh...&quot; Her two friends exchanged a glance, and the oddly haired one 
reached over and patted the sorrowful girl&#39;s hand. &quot;There, there, Sam. 
You were too good for her anyways. You should just go out there, honey, 
and find a nice, sweet girl to take home and-&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; Reddened, bloodshot eyes glared up from the table. With a drunken 
blush across her cheeks, and her nose wrinkled up in frustration, she 
looked like a rather cute guy that had just a bit of a feminine look 
about him. Her short hair did nothing to dispel that illusion. &quot;I don&#39;t 
want another one-night stand. I thought I had her this time. The One.&quot; 
She slumped back down, sprawled across the table. &quot;Maybe I&#39;m not 
supposed to have anyone. Maybe I should just stop looking.&quot;

Oblivious as she was in heartbroken self-pity, she didn&#39;t notice as her 
friend&#39;s hand abruptly left hers. What she did notice, however, was the 
sudden, warm embrace she found herself enveloped in. &quot;Never, ever stop 
looking, sweetie. You just haven&#39;t found the right girl yet.&quot;

After a few minutes of silence, Sam leaned back into the hug with a 
sigh. &quot;Fine... I won&#39;t, Sisi.&quot;

The cheery elder girl gave her a quick squeeze, then stood up. &quot;Okay. 
Now, I&#39;m gonna take my delectable little morsel of a girlfriend out on 
the dance floor. I expect a smile on your face by the time I get back, 
Hon, or else...&quot; She let her words trail off with a mischievous grin. 
Offering her hand to the third person at the table, she led her 
girlfriend across the dance floor, where they were quickly lost from 
sight amongst the enormous crowd of dancers.

For a while, the last girl left at the table made little movement from 
the position she was in. Then she began to laugh. &#39;Sisi... You&#39;re 
priceless.&#39; The shorter, but older girl had been the brunette&#39;s best 
friend for two years, since she was sixteen. In fact, she was also her 
first girlfriend. Even feeling as down as she was, the memory of the 
time Sisi had slept with her brought a blush to her cheeks and a smile 
to her lips...

~Two Years Ago~

Two women laid in bed, covered in but a sheen of sweet and a thin white 
sheet. They were content in each other&#39;s arms, basking in the afterglow 
of their earlier activities. &quot;Why,&quot; mumbled one drowsily, &quot;did you do 
that?&quot;

Giggling, Sisi, lying on top of her, kisses her collarbone. &quot;Because 
you&#39;re cute, sugar.&quot; She purred softly as a kitten as she trailed her 
fingers down Sam&#39;s sides. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;ve never done this before? 
You&#39;re very good.&quot;

She blushed, a faint rosy glow about her cheeks and other, 
unmentionable, places. &quot;No, I&#39;ve never done this before... But do you 
believe me now that I&#39;m not a boy?&quot; Running a hand down the purring 
girl&#39;s back, she used her other hand to brush her bangs aside. 

&quot;Oh, I knew you weren&#39;t a boy...&quot; The smaller girl nuzzled into the 
crook of her lover&#39;s neck. &quot;Though, if you had been I wouldn&#39;t&#39;ve 
complained.&quot; 

For a short time, there was silence again, Sisi drifting off into the 
gentle caresses of slumber, and Sam lost in her own thoughts. Then, just 
before sleep claimed the Sisi, she spoke up. &quot;Hey... Sisi?&quot;

&quot;Mmmn... yes?&quot;

&quot;Umm... I like you and all, but...&quot; She trailed off, wondering how to 
continue.

&quot;But...?&quot; Sitting up a bit, the shapely elder girl looked her straight 
in the face. &quot;You aren&#39;t attracted to girls, dear?&quot; 

&quot;No, no, no,&quot; she blushed, &quot;Last night was wonderful. Its just...&quot; She 
paused a moment, to plan her next words carefully. Then, taking a deep 
breath, she finished, &quot;I like you, but only as a friend. No offense, but 
I wouldn&#39;t be able to stand being around you every waking moment.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; With a sly look upon her face, Sisi moved around until she was 
straddling Sam&#39;s hips. &quot;Too bad, babe,&quot; she purred into the boyish 
girl&#39;s ear huskily, &quot;But I think I can survive... So long as we can keep 
doing *this*&quot; Slowly, too slowly, her hand-

~End Flashback~

Blushing profusely, she cut off the memory right there. &#39;As nice as that 
thought is, this isn&#39;t be nest time or place for that.&#39; Sighing, she sat 
up again and took a sip of the beer in front of her. &#39;I wish Susan 
hadn&#39;t left me... I thought we had something special, that it was 
love...&#39; Gazing around the bar, her eyes made their way slowly to the 
window, left open to let the breeze flow in and cool down the sweaty 
dancers. Looking out, up into the night sky, she noticed the star 
Sapphos, shining brightly in the sky. &#39;Sapphos... The goddess of 
love...&#39; slowly, a small smile drifted across her face. &#39;Maybe she 
wasn&#39;t the one... Maybe...&#39;

&quot;Whew!&quot; Coming seemingly out of nowhere, Sisi plopped herself down into 
the seat across from Sam, startling her. Grinning happily, she looked 
her friend over. &quot;You&#39;re smiling! What brought this about?&quot;

&quot;Just memories, and a bit of superstition.&quot; Still smiling softly at her 
best of friends, she went to take another sip of her drink. Stopping 
halfway and blinking, of course, as she caught a good look at her cheek. 
&quot;Sisi? What happened to your cheek?&quot; 

Laughing, the oddly haired girl lightly touched the enormous red 
handprint on her cheek. &quot;I tried to grope her out on the dance floor... 
I don&#39;t really think she&#39;s decided to be quite so open as you or me. Too 
bad... Fate&#39;s such a hot little minx in bed.&quot; With an exaggerated sigh, 
the cheerful young woman watched her best friend collapse onto the table 
again, shaking with tears of suppressed mirth.



~Author&#39;s Notes: Well, here&#39;s chapter two, folks! Now that I&#39;ve 
completed this, I&#39;m gonna take a slight break and focus on my RPing and 
writing a story for the Evil Spring Fanfiction Contest. Still, though, 
that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m gonna stop writing this! Much thanks to the real 
Sisi, who beta&#39;d this chapter for me, and tons of thanks to all the 
people who reviewed my story; It really helped me out a lot. Much thanks 
to everyone!
