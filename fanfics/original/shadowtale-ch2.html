<h1>A Shadowlander's Tale: One's Purpose (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowtale-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Kai opened her eyes to look up at the clouds. She had spent the last 
hour or so laying on the roof of the school letting her thoughts roll 
about in her mind. She found this to be the quietest place in the entire 
city, for no one ever seemed to visit there. Ever since her nightmares 
started to plague her dreams she would stretch out on the cool concrete 
gazing at the clouds. She wondered frequently about where she came from 
and how she got here. She had been told that she was discovered late at 
night near the edge of a dark forest that the residence have come to 
call the Western Woods, however no one seemed to talk very much about 
these woods or what was beyond them. She tried to ask on numerous 
occasions what was so special about the forest only to have her question 
either ignored or the person quickly changed the subject. 

She go to her feet and went to the edge of the roof, which was encircled 
by a large chain linked fence. She linked her fingers between the chain 
and looked out over the town. Far off in the distance she could see the 
Western Woods. It looked just like any other dense field of brush, yet 
she was told to steer clear of that area for it was filled with 
mysterious creatures that would stop at nothing to take her life. Part 
of her considered that maybe death would be better then this life of 
loneliness. She spun around and leaned heavily against the fence causing 
it to make that musical &quot;ching&quot; sound that she enjoyed so much. She 
staring up at the sky again. There had to be an answer to the mysteries 
that surrounded her and those woods. She just needed to know where to 
look. Then a light turned on in her head and she felt so stupid. The 
schools library was filled with information about this world&#39;s history 
and people. There should be something regarding the woods and maybe she 
could find reference to where she came from. 

Excitedly she pushed off the fence and sprung forwards. She opened the 
door to the stairwell and  skipped down the stairs inspired by the 
notation that she may be able to solve the puzzle that is her life. The 
library was located on the top floor of the school so Kai found it easy 
not to alert her presence to any of the teachers. The libraries doors 
were large and carved out of a thick old red oak, while all the other 
doors in the building were constructed of cold steel. Kai had never 
ventured into the library before, however the sight of the doors gave 
even more confidence that the answers would lay beyond them. She gripped 
the thick vertical brass bar handle of one of doors and pulled it 
slightly opened to peer within it&#39;s confined. When she was certain there 
were no teachers about she slipped into the room and silently closed to 
the door behind her.

Kai stepped into the room to find herself standing along a long narrow 
balcony that stretched around the edge of a round circular room with a 
gentle slope and books lining all the walls. Brass piping had been woven 
together to create an elaborate railing the extended along the entire 
edge of the balcony. She approached a railing and placed a hand upon the 
thick brass piping. She peered over the railing into the depths of the 
room. It was like the library spiralled downwards hundreds of floors 
which was beyond impossible because she knew for a fact that her home 
room rested beneath her very feet. She turned and blinked in awe at the 
scale of the shelves around her. Books could be seen covering ever inch 
of wall to a point that was dizzying to the small girl. Ladder with 
wheel on the bottoms stretch high above her on more brass railings that 
ran around the top of the shelves. Every so often she could see a door 
in amongst the shelves that she suspected would lead to even more 
shelves lined with even more books. She let out a frustrated sigh at the 
seer scale of the madness. All hope of finding anything useful fizzled 
from her mind at that moment and she turned to leave before even 
starting. When someone spoke to her. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; A young polite feminie voice said from behind Kai, &quot;Can I help 
you?&quot;

Kai nervously turned around to find a girl, not much older then herself, 
standing before her. The girl was slightly taller then Kai and had long 
straight black hair that hung over the girl&#39;s beautiful long dark  
Victorian dress. She wore pale white foundation, or Kai assumed it was 
make up, black eyeliner and black lipstick. She looked as if she had 
just stepped out of one of the many old books that lined the walls, 
&quot;I...&quot;  Kai found it hard to speak as she stared at the girl. Her mind 
raced as she tried to think of some excuse for her being there, &quot;We were 
told to do research project on our family history and I thought I might 
find something here...&quot; She cleverly lied and gave a nervous smile. She 
was struck by the girl&#39;s unusual beauty.

The girl blinked at Kai and thought for a moment, &quot;Are you not the one 
from the Western Woods?&quot; The girl hinted curiously as she took a step 
closer to Kai causing her to back up bit. 

Kai nodded ever so slowly and broke her gaze free of the girl to look 
around the Library again, &quot;I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m from so I thought...&quot; 
She was still in awe of the scale of the room, and the girl for that 
fact. She could not help her eyes from jumping back to her every now and 
then. 

The girl quickly moved even closer, catching Kai off guard and making 
her stumble slightly, &quot;I am so glad you came.&quot; The girl exclaimed with a 
smile that made Kai all the more nervous, &quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to meet 
you. I&#39;m had a fascination with the Woods for a long time now. I know 
where all the material you need will be.&quot; She took Kai by the hand and 
started to pull her down the walkway.

&quot;Uhh... thanks...&quot; Kai was baffled by the girl&#39;s sudden change in mood. 
Aside from Anita no one wanted anything to do with her. She was feared 
by many as some kind of demon in the guise of a girl. Even Anita took 
some time to warm up to her. This was the first time anyone treated her 
in such an usual manner. Kai was not sure how to handle the situation. 
She then noticed that the girl had a pair of small black leather wings 
poking out of the back of her dress. She was not sure if they were part 
of the girl&#39;s clothes or not, when one of them waved at her. She was 
unsure if it was waving or it was just her imagination. 

Kai was pulled towards a pair of large high backed golden wood chair 
with red velvet padding on the seat, back and arms. The chairs were set 
against the railing with a small night table of similar design. As they 
drew closer Kai&#39;s attention was drawn to the intriguingly carved arms 
and legs of the chair that were designed like large lizard like claws 
protruded from them. Two even larger birds claws had been carved into 
either side of the top of the chair.  Kai  pondered over if they 
represented dragons or some other monestrous lizard. When the girl sat 
Kai into the chair.

&quot;Get ready for a ride.&quot; The girl stated as she ran over to the other 
chair and sat down with a slight bounce. On the night table was a small 
brass lamp with a glass shade covered with stained glass images of 
winged creatures flying through the sky. There were odd looking markings 
around the base of the lamp. The girl ran a finger along the markings 
causing several of them to glow. Suddenly the chairs lurched, &quot;You might 
want to hold on to something.&quot; She commented with a mischievous grin. 
Before Kai could fathom what the girl was talking about the chairs rosed 
slightly off the ground. She turned her head to see that the bird claws 
on the top of the chair came to life and latched to the railing. Kai 
grabbed onto the arms of the chair unsure of what to expect when they 
were suddenly sailing around the balcony at an increasing speed. The 
book rushed passed them like a blur and Kai was beginning to feel like 
she was on some kind of warped amusement part ride. Downward they 
spiralled into the depths of the library. Shortly the books disappeared 
and the girls were plunged into complete darkness. 

&quot;Where are you talking me?&quot; Kai demanded. 

&quot;To the deepest part of the library.&quot; The girl stated with a grin of 
amusement, holding her hair in place as she turned to look at Kai, &quot;Some 
of the older books are down here.&quot; Suddenly the chairs came to a halt 
and the girl got to her feet, &quot;Here we are!&quot; The girl exclaimed with a 
twirl, she waved her arms around the room she had brought Kai too. This 
area looked nothing like the rest of the library. The ceiling was low 
and wood beams could be seen overhead. There was a small window high up 
on the wall that was covering in a yellowish film. Kai was certain that 
they had gone down and not up so what lay beyond that window was a 
curiosity. Lines of shelves comprised of a large portion of the room and 
the rest was filled with long wooden tables with small over hanging 
yellow lights. There was a layer of dust and dirt on the floor that made 
Kai wonder if anyone every ventured down here in years. It reminded Kai 
more of a dusty, dim attic then a library. Kai spun around the room in 
stunned bewilderment. She could not believe such a place existed within 
the walls of the school. The girl set her hands on her hips in 
satisfaction of Kai&#39;s wonder struck expression, &quot;Impressing is it not? 
You can find some of the oldest information about this town up here. 
Most stir clear so you don&#39;t have to worry about being bothered by 
anyone.&quot; She turned and gave Kai a broad smile revealing a set of tiny 
fangs, &quot;By the way, I&#39;m Vivienne. Pleasure to meet you.&quot; She extended 
her hand and presented the back of it to Kai. 

Kai stared at the girl&#39;s long black nails that poked out of holes cut in 
the finger tips of the lace gloves and scratched her head, &quot;I&#39;m Kai... 
same...&quot; She started to look around the room trying to think of where to 
start. 

Vivienne looked down at her hand then at Kai, &quot;You are not very 
gentlemanly now are you?&quot; She hinted with a mark of distaste. 

&quot;Since when are girls gentlemen?&quot; She countered with glaring at 
Vivienne. 

Vivienne blinked at Kai, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... I... You just look...&quot; She 
stammered and flushed. 

Kai rolled her eyes, &quot;I know... I&#39;m well aware... I checked myself.&quot; She 
remarked looking at the many shelves, &quot;Where would I find books on the 
woods?&quot; She inquired trying to change the subject. 

&quot;Here let me help you.&quot; Vivienne ran down the hall closest to where they 
stood, &quot;I have found several stories about the subject, however most are 
myths and legends so there is nothing concrete.&quot; She explained as she 
skimmed the titles of the books. 

Kai followed closely behind the girl not wanting to get lost, &quot;Anything 
is better than nothing.&quot; She remarked looking at the books. All looked 
extremely old and large, most of the titles had faded away. She had no 
idea how she would find anything in this mess. 

Vivienne ran a finger along the books until she came to a stop on a 
large tome about the size of her forearm, &quot;Here you go.&quot; She pulled the 
book off the shelf and handed it to Kai who had to use both arms to hold 
the monster, &quot;That covered most of the myths of the town and surrounding 
areas. The rest don&#39;t have much of anything wood itself. If anything, 
that will give you the answers you are seeking. 

Kai clumsily opened the book and looked upon it&#39;s pages, &quot;Dreams and the 
Ghost that haunt them?&quot; She read aloud. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Vivienne smiled delighted with herself, &quot;It is cool. There is a 
lot of things in there that I would never have thought about. Oh and...&quot; 
She stood on her tip toes to grab a smaller book from the topmost shelf 
and placed it atop the other in Kai&#39;s arms, &quot;This may have some more 
info about the town itself. Interesting but not very helpful. You can 
take it over to that tables near the front of the room if you like.&quot; She 
nodded towards the lines of table, &quot;but I can&#39;t let you sign them out 
and sorry for all the dust. Like I said none get&#39;s down here much.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Kai carried the tome to the tables. 

&quot;I need to go back upstairs.&quot; Vivienne said, a little saddened, &quot;I&#39;ll 
check on you every now and then, alright?&quot; She offered with a smile.

&quot;Sure.&quot; Kai replied coolly, then set the book down with a thud that sent 
dust everywhere and plopped into a nearby wooden chair while waving the 
dirt out of the air, &quot;Thanks... again...&quot; She half coughed with a wave 
over her shoulder.

&quot;Your welcome.&quot; Vivienne watch Kai begin to pour through the pages of 
the book. When she didn&#39;t get another response she frowned. She plopped 
down in one of the gold chairs, crossed her legs and headed back up into 
the main area of the library. 

Kai opened her backpack and pulled out a piece of paper with a sketch 
she had made of the image she had seen in Ashley&#39;s eyes and placed it 
beside the book. She started to read over the old text in search of some 
form of information about herself or the image. She stopped on a page 
with a drawing of a large dog made of fire and read the caption below, 
&quot;and from the depths of hatred  was formed a dog whose body comprised of 
nothing but flames and breath smelt of burnt flesh...&quot; She shuttered 
that the mere thought of meeting something like that. She picked up the 
smaller book and flipped through it&#39;s pages. As Vivienne had said this 
book was more technical and dealt with a lot of the theories about the 
inhabitants of the city of Darken. Before long she found herself 
engrossed in the fables and legends of the city only a year ago she had 
woken up in. Time drifted by and it was several hours before she came 
across the first mention of the forest and it&#39;s unusual history. 

	&quot;The Western Woods exists at the westernmost edge of Darken&quot; She 
read aloud, &quot;and covers most of it&#39;s boarder to the north and west 
making travel to the west near impossible without trying to journey 
around the dreaded woods. It is rumoured to be the home of demons and 
creatures related to death and decay. Many have claimed to have seen the 
shadows within the woods to move in unnatural ways. As if it were 
somehow alive in some way. Many dared to venture into the forest in 
search of some path to a nearby village only to never return again.  To 
this day only those wishing for an end even journey near the woods at 
night. 

	Even more unusual than the creatures of the woods are the strange 
appearance of children found near the edge of the forest. Every few 
years a child is found lying close to the edge of the woods with no 
recollection of how they got there or where they came from. Many times 
these children have no memories from before they appeared at our 
boarders. Some claim that spirits guided the children back from the dead 
so they could have a second chance at life. While others believe that 
there is a darker reason for these children&#39;s existence and that 
darkness will befall the town for allowing them to stay. To this day no 
one has a clear answer.&quot;

Kai slammed the book shut, &quot;Yeah, yeah and on my eighteenth year I&#39;ll 
steal everyone&#39;s daughters and lure them back into the realm of death.&quot; 
She flung the book over her shoulder in disgust, &quot;As if...&quot;

The book hit a surprised Anita in the middle of her face before falling 
to the ground with a heavy thud, &quot;KAI!!!&quot; She approached the girl with a 
clenched fist. 

Kai looked up to see her friend floating over her, &quot;Oh, hi Anita, I 
didn&#39;t see you there.&quot; Kai said unaware that she just hit the girl with 
a book. She looked around to see that the moving chair was nowhere in 
sight, &quot;How did you find me down here?&quot; She puzzled.

&quot;I drifted down.&quot; Anita explained, the anger melting away at the sight 
of her friend&#39;s eyes, &quot;Vivienne told me you were down here, but I 
couldn&#39;t believe it was true.&quot; She leaned over Kai&#39;s shoulder to see 
what it was she was reading, &quot;Were you here during all lunch? I was 
looking everywhere for you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been here since second period.&quot; Kai stretched and let out a 
small yawn, &quot;Why what time is it?&quot; She asked noticing for the first time 
that there were no clocks in the room.

&quot;Almost two o&#39;clock.&quot; Anita stated, &quot;What are you up to down here 
anyway?&quot; She inquired curiously floating a little higher while keeping 
her hands on Kai&#39;s shoulder to get a better look at the tome before her 
friend. 

&quot;I&#39;m studying.&quot; Kai replied leaning over the large book again. 

&quot;No really, what are you up to?&quot; Anita repeated with a small chuckle. 

&quot;If you really want to know,&quot; Kai said with a defeated sigh, &quot;I&#39;m 
researching something I saw when I looked into that girl&#39;s eyes.&quot; She 
explained, &quot;I&#39;m having troubles finding any useful info here. Have you 
any idea how huge this place is?&quot; She let her eyes drift over the pages 
of the book, &quot;Never mind how interesting the towns history is. Almost 
makes me wish I hadn&#39;t skipped all those history classes. Are there 
really demons in the Western woods?&quot; She inquired peculiarly.

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Anita was suddenly struck by how stupid she had been, &quot;That is 
right you when they found you near the wood you didn&#39;t have your 
memories. I didn&#39;t realize how much you didn&#39;t know about until now.&quot; 
She felt ashamed of herself for not considering this before. 

Kai shrugged, &quot;Here, take a look at this.&quot; Kai hands over the paper with 
the she sketch on it, &quot;I saw those marking surrounded by a pillar of 
flames.&quot; Kai explained as she turns back to the books, &quot;I remember 
hearing something about this kind of thing, but can&#39;t recall what it 
means. What do you think, Anita?&quot; She inquired and back to the book. She 
turned the pages awaiting her friends response. When none came she 
became worried, &quot;Anita?&quot; Kai turns back to her friend. Anita stood 
rooted to her spot staring at the sketch in her hands and tremble ever 
so slightly, &quot;Anita, Is there something wrong? You know what it means 
don&#39;t you?&quot; She probed her friend. 

&quot;This is a great sketch.&quot; Anita suddenly burst out into false 
cheerfulness, &quot;I was just thinking that you should look into become a 
comic book artist or an illustrator or something.&quot; She said with a fake 
grin. 

&quot;Stop fooling around!&quot; Kai got up from her seat and glared irately at 
Anita, &quot;I know when you are hiding something.&quot; She stormed over to her 
friend, not letting her eyes weaver from the girl&#39;s, stopping when their 
foreheads almost met. &quot;You were bragging for weeks about being the top 
of our class in Shadow and Dream Lore. You know what this means, so 
spill it.&quot; She demanded with teeth bared. 

&quot;Kai, you&#39;re scaring me...&quot; Anita whispered nervously. She lowered her 
eyes in defeat, &quot;Fine, since you insist.&quot; She turned and headed towards 
one of the further aisle. &quot;You&#39;re more than likely to discover the 
answer on your own sooner or later anyway.&quot; She stated dismally with Kai 
quickly stooping to grab the small book off the ground and followed 
after her, &quot;Almost everyone in Darken knows what it means,&quot; Anita 
continued, &quot;because we are told stories about it from the very day we&#39;re 
born.&quot; She spun around to glance at her friend causing Kai to stumble 
and nearly drop the book. Anite leaned against one of the shelves with 
her arms crossed and her eyes lightly closed, &quot;You already know how the 
Realms of Shadow and Death exist almost side-by-side right?&quot; She probed 
as she took off her glasses and cleaned them on the hem of her shirt.

&quot;Sort of.&quot; Kai sat down on the edge of a nearby table across from her 
friend and opened the book in her arms, &quot;It said here that there were 
several realms and that they were all linked in some way or another.&quot; 
She stated as she flipped through the pages. 

Anita replaced her glasses and fixed them around her ears, &quot;The main 
realms are Shadow, Light, Death, Dream and Nightmare.&quot; Anita explained 
further, &quot;They exist off one another. Somewhere in the Realm of Death in 
a place known as The Hall of Candles live nine sisters. The Sisters of 
Death as they like to be called. Angels of Death or Grim Reapers to 
others.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kai stopped on a page in the book, &quot;There was mention of them 
but I skipped it. I didn&#39;t think they would have anything to do with 
this.&quot; 

&quot;That is where you are wrong.&quot; Anita&#39;s look grew long and a depression 
filled her eyes, &quot;These sisters roam the worlds in search of those who 
have passed away. They bring the dead back to The Death&#39;s Corridor for 
their eternal slumber.&quot; She looked at Kai&#39;s sketch, &quot;There are two 
distinct things about the sisters that can tell you if you are facing a 
true dark angel. One is that usually they have huge wings growing out of 
their backs, sometimes they are feathers and other times they are 
something else, however their wings can fold up and entirely disappear 
making spotting one rather hard. They are instead replaced by an odd 
Tattooed winged pattern on their backs.&quot; She turned down the aisle next 
to her and grabbed a book off the top shelve and flipped through the 
pages of the book until she stopped on a page and brought it to Kai, 
&quot;Tattoos just like the one you have drawn here.&quot; She flipped the book 
around and handed it to Kai with her sketch placed between its pages. 
The book showed a page of winged drawings. Atop the page was the title, 
&#145;The Nine Sisters of Death.&quot;

Kai shakily took book from Anita and compared the drawings to her 
sketch, &quot;But wha... what does this mean?&quot; She stammered in  complete 
astonishment, looking from her sketch to each of the nine tattoos in the 
book until she found one that matched and read out the caption, &quot;Keelia: 
Sometimes referred to as the Destroyer of Souls or the Fiery eyed Demon 
of Death. Known to hunt down ghouls and faceless that escaped the Realms 
of Death. She is relentless and never gives up until the hunt is over. 
Probably the most distinct of all the sisters for she has six large 
wings and flame tattoos running along her entire right arm.&quot; She turned 
to her friend in confusion, &quot;What does all this have to do with me?&quot; She 
asked frantically.

Anita slumped in a chair beside Kai and laced her fingers together, &quot;It 
is said that if one sees any of these images in their dreams then that 
person will come face-to-face with one of these Dark Angels. Either to 
come for their soul...&quot; Anita trembled and clenched her arms tightly 
around herself, &quot;or someone close to them.&quot; 

Kai let out a forced laugh, &quot;That is a good one.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;You&#39;re 
always such a kidder. What does it really mean?&quot; She looked down at her 
friend who&#39;s head was lowered and there was a dark atmosphere drifting 
from the girl. &quot;Anita?&quot; She probed gently setting the book to her side, 
&quot;You were joking right?&quot; 

Anita turned her head away and remained silent.

&quot;Come on, tell me you were only kidding around.&quot; Kai demanded in 
frustration of the girl&#39;s silence, &quot;Anita?&quot; She reached out to touch her 
friend.

Anita only shrank into the chair even more and turned transparent.

&quot;Oh, I see...&quot; Kai said dismally. It all became clear to her now. Anita 
had never lied to her before and the lack of a response told Kai that 
this was certainly not a joke. She suddenly perked up, &quot;I know! You&#39;re 
the expert on this kind of thing. You can just explain to them that they 
have the wrong person. Problem solved.&quot; She resolved clapping her hands 
together in satisfaction. 

Anita instantly solidified and sprung to her feet knocking the chair 
back. She glared irately at Kai, &quot;You don&#39;t get it, do you?!?&quot; She 
yelled at the girl, slamming her hand down on the table, &quot;This is death 
we are talking about and I&#39;m a partial ghost. Half Dead!&quot;

&quot;Ack, A Zombie!!&quot; Kai pointed accusingly.

&quot;I AM NOT!&quot; Anita retorted outraged by her friend&#39;s lighthearted manners 
to the situation, &quot;For once in your life will you be serious?&quot; She 
screamed at Kai, &quot;If a Sister so much as catches whiff of me she won&#39;t 
think twice about finishing off what was already started and I&#39;m not 
ready to go yet.&quot; She exclaimed frantically, &quot;Kai, I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She 
sobbed and dropped back down into a new chair, the rage in her voice 
died away. Replaced only by fear and sadness, &quot;I can&#39;t... If it was 
anything else then you know I&#39;d be there for you, but why did it have to 
be something like this?&quot; Tears streamed down her face, she dropped her 
face into her hand and let out a series of chocked sobs. 
				
&quot;Anita...&quot; Kai jumped down from her seat and gingerly set an hand upon 
her friend&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Please don&#39;t cry. Everything will be fine&quot; She 
cooed softly, &quot;Neither of us are going anywhere. You&#39;ll see.&quot; She 
declared with a genuine smile. 

Anita set her sad eyes upon Kai&#39;s bright blue eyes, &quot;Promise me...&quot; She 
pleaded, &quot;Promise me that if one of those Dark Angels comes for you, 
you&#39;ll run like I did. Run as fast as you can. Promise that we will go 
to school like we always do. Just you and me...&quot; 

Kai smiled down at her friend, &quot;I promise.&quot; She stated firmly, &quot;We&#39;ll go 
to school together tomorrow and every day after that. Nothing will tear 
us apart... not even Death.&quot;
