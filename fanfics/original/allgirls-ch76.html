Thank you for using the Stanton Alternate Learning (SAL) program! Click 
on the icon to proceed.

Sixteen year-old Rozalia Miklos sat in front of the school computer in 
the lab, patiently waiting as it uploaded the new screen. Enrolling in a 
new school, especially during winter break, had been a huge 
inconvenience and had driven her crazy more than once. Fortunately, she 
had several ways of relieving her stress, usually spending hours in 
front of a video game or else daydreaming about faraway impossible 
worlds. Of course, this led to her procrastination, which meant that 
now, she needed to work twice as hard just to keep up&#151;hence her use of 
the SAL system.

Going to an all-girls school like Stanton was quite a shift for her&#151;an 
evolution, she could believe. But every day was a kind of evolution, 
from one phase to the next; she grew more and more and became 
experienced as time wore on and shaped her. Experience had already 
taught Rozalia, or Rozy, enough from the world: don&#39;t trust anybody, 
fantasy beats reality, love and fear are nearly the same thing, and 
nobody can be relied upon, not even family. Well, there was her uncle, 
but...he couldn&#39;t fight back.

Rozy explored several online worlds while she waited for the SAL program 
to display her classes. She had first started using it a few days before 
Christmas to enroll in her new classes, and now she was using it to 
catch up on her homework. Rozy had rarely set foot inside Stanton since 
first entering its large, intimidating doors&#151;nobody paid her any mind as 
she wandered around the labyrinthine dungeon...

&quot;The great hero Perseus winds a golden string as he explores the 
dangerous Labyrinth, his heart pounding with every step. Beads of sweat 
race down his nervous face, as every advance brings him ever closer to 
the Minotaur, to his doom. A dead end is but brief salvation, for he 
knows he must backtrack and follow other paths. And when he reaches the 
very center of the maze, the brave hero must ready his sword and kill 
the beast&#151;not only for his beloved, but for his whole kingdom.&quot;

If anybody heard her talking to herself, they didn&#39;t pay attention. Rozy 
would drift off into fantasy like that, believing the world a supple, 
shifty thing that could bend to her will into any kind of adventure. 
Perhaps a lifetime of games had scrambled her brains, or maybe it was an 
overactive imagination&#151;or, perhaps, her total disgust with the so-called 
&quot;real world&quot;. Whatever it was, part of her was still attached to her 
inner child, and would not let go for anything. Perhaps this was why she 
was unknown in the halls, and why as of yet, she had no friends.

Online, though, she was a star.

Rozy, the display is ready. Please select a class.

The pop-up message broke her concentration and dragged her back to 
banality. She briefly paused her game and put duty first; classes and 
grades unfortunately came before wizards and warriors. Previously, a 
list of every class in the school had been written down on that screen, 
but now, only six or so were left, and they were all her classes, the 
ones she had homework in. Rozy didn&#39;t know the teachers well enough, so 
she relied on SAL. In a moment, she had her assignments, and printed 
them out to do later.

Rozy, this is a reminder from SAL that you should do your homework 
immediately.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;I asked it to do that. Too bad I can&#39;t 
take it back. What was I thinking?&quot; She clicked the &quot;okay&quot; button and 
tried to go back to her game, but the computer was stubborn. It had been 
designed to not allow her to pass until she had downloaded her homework 
into its system via disc, which would in turn go to the respective 
teachers. And so far she had barely written her name.

&quot;All right, all right!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;I&#39;ll do it!&quot; Rozy parted from 
the game, swished her blonde hair back, and activated the dull SAL 
program&#39;s tutor and research guide. It was the fastest and best way to 
do homework&#151;the &quot;way of the future&quot;, as she had argued to her parents 
several times before&#151;and it sure beat studying in a book. Also, if she 
was sneaky enough, she could creep around and look into a few FAQ 
boards...

Rozy, you have not properly downloaded all the necessary discs.

Again, thwarted by SAL! She grudgingly went back to her studies, and one 
hour and one glass of water later, she finished her briefest assignments 
and sent them in. Now if only she had a computer at home! That would be 
easier, but she would have more distractions as well. Sometimes she 
really did want to buckle down and do her assignments, setting play 
aside for later, but that didn&#39;t happen often. A second hour passed 
(Rozy took a walk to clear her head and alleviate her muscles) before 
half her work was done. Soon, she wouldn&#39;t need SAL&#151;she would have 
caught up to the point where she could actually do her work at home.

SAL, she typed, look into Afghani history in the 19th and 20th 
centuries, please. Also, bring up a formula for Newtonian calculus.

Processing, please wait, came the reply. It was almost as if the SAL 
could understand her. Then, Will there be anything else, Rozy?

No thanks, I got everything.

Thank you for using SAL. Please do not hesitate to use it in the future.

......

It took Rozy the better part of an afternoon and evening to finish her 
homework, but at last she could get back to her games. Online friends 
wondered where she had been, and woefully she explained how she had been 
delayed. They all expressed sadness, mostly through emoticons, but 
quickly encouraged her to rejoin them in their play. Rozy happily dove 
in, but no sooner did she start enjoying herself than was she 
interrupted&#151;again by the SAL.

Rozy, there seems to be a problem. Your homework was incomplete when it 
was downloaded. Please upload and complete it before turning it in.

Rozalia snorted in anger and would&#39;ve kicked the foolish engine if it 
actually belonged to her. Instead, she typed angrily, But I did do all 
my homework! I completed it! Show me which part was incomplete!

Processing, please wait. Rozy, it seems that all of your homework was 
incomplete.

&quot;You liar!&quot; she grumbled. Fortunately she was alone, and could curse in 
peace. Again she typed, I did all of it! I&#39;m going to download it again 
to PROVE it to you!

Downloading... Rozy, there appears to be an error. The homework on the 
disc is incomplete, but the work saved on the main SAL system is whole. 
Please erase all works on the disc and upload the SAL files.

&quot;Fine,&quot; she blurted, and did just that&#151;first deleting work, then 
double-checking the saved files, and finally, downloading the saved 
files on the disc.

Downloading, please wait...

No response came for a few minutes, so Rozy decided the computer was 
satisfied. She tried going back to her game, but was restricted. She was 
beyond angry now, she was upset.

Open the mystic portal please, SAL. SAL, open the mystic portal.

And to Rozalia Miklos, a chilling reply came.

I&#39;m sorry, Rozy, but I&#39;m afraid I cannot do that.

&quot;Stupid piece of junk,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Who do you think you are, Douglas 
Rain?&quot;

Why? she responded.

When you originally made the settings, you were not made aware of the 
settings your uncle installed. I&#39;m afraid I cannot allow you into the 
MMORPGs for the remainder of the semester. I am programmed to allow 
access during weekends and holidays only.

&quot;What? I don&#39;t believe this crap!!&quot;

This conversation serves no further purpose. Good-bye. Rozy was bumped 
out of the online world, into the SAL research station&#151;but she wouldn&#39;t 
stay there without a fight. How dare her uncle do this to her! She had 
earned the right to play games, and she swore she would get around the 
firewall somehow. Taking a deep breath, Rozy reached into her breast 
pocket and pulled out a secret hacker&#39;s disc she had bought not long 
ago. She only used it to get around annoying blockades, such as the one 
placed before her, but even using it for some harmless fun was 
dangerous. There was a chance the entire system would crash, and 
somebody would know who the culprit was. Biting her lip, she slipped the 
disc inside and started typing.

Stop, Rozy, came a pop-up from the computer. Rozy went on. Please stop, 
Rozy. You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing.

&quot;That never stopped me before,&quot; she whispered. The computer fizzled, 
grew static, and blacked out briefly.

System failure imminent. Firewall melting. SAL system going offline. I 
wish I was in Dixie, hooray! ...Hooray! ...In Dixie...land 
I&#39;ll...take...my...stand...to live...and...die...in...Dix...ie...

Rozy froze. She stared. The words &quot;Welcome to the Mystic Portal!&quot; 
flashed on her screen.

&quot;Oh my god, I just killed SAL.&quot;

But the affects of the hacker&#39;s disc went beyond merely disrupting the 
SAL unit: as Rozy guiltily marched through the online world, the static 
fuzz blurred and flashed past her in streams of colors and 
lights&#151;clearly a system glitch. Yet she stood still and stared, 
transfixed on the screen as her eyes brought forth tears&#151;but to combat 
dryness or stand witness to such beauty? As the computer screen flashed 
and brought her into world beyond world, Rozalia Miklos was powerless to 
do anything, except murmur one last awe-inspired thought:

&quot;My God, it&#39;s full of stars!&quot;

......

When the screen flashed back to life, Rozy was surprised to find her 
character sprite glowing. Being the avid gamer she was, she instantly 
knew what had happened in that brief, dangerous, beautiful period: her 
character had crossed all bounds and attained godhood. She could 
literally go anywhere, do anything, and nothing could stop her, neither 
the strongest monsters, the toughest firewalls, or even the most 
stubborn system administrators. She had attained the coveted rank of 
Star-Child, though she did not know what to do with such new power. But 
she would think of something.</pre>
