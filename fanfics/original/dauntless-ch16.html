<p>“The Marriage of Diona:  Alala has a new stepmommy!”</p>
<p>            There was nothing particularly outstanding about Gonn, the world where the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> took rest.  The weather was fair and mild, the population simple and  peaceful, and the land had a quaint, rustic beauty, with a few small  cities dotted about dedicated to perpetuating the image of a relaxing  vacation spot.  This was Gonn’s one and only true claim to fame:  it  was a small, friendly, somewhat isolated world that pampered tourists  and strove to make everyone feel like they were back at home.  Firearms  were strictly forbidden and so most of the crewmembers were delayed as  they hung up their weapons and came into the world armed only with  their teeth and nails.</p>
<p>            Alala was sitting with the few  friends she had made during the long adventure, quietly picking at her  meal as she stared numbly at the table.  She wasn’t used to excitement  and had suffered from an overdose as the <em>Dauntless</em> hopped from  one quest to the next—so sitting still and enjoying the day, which she  once thought of as a luxury, had now lost its appeal.  She wanted  something to excite her and to challenge her, but lately, the only  thing that came close was—</p>
<p>            “What’s wrong, Lala?  You look so gloomy…but you’re still cute.”</p>
<p>             “Shut up, Marliir,” she grunted, stuffing food into her mouth.  It was  getting cold and had lost most of its flavor, but she was too stubborn  to throw it out.  “I am not in the mood to deal with you right now!”</p>
<p>            “But you’re never in the mood to deal with me,” she pointed lovingly.</p>
<p>            “That’s because for some weird reason, you can’t go five minutes without being a pain in the ass.”</p>
<p>            “I think you enjoy it!” she laughed.</p>
<p>“Shut  up!”  Alala rose and stormed off, but was stopped suddenly by a local  postal patrol robot.  With the decline and subsequent removal of paper  mail, nearly all messages and letters were sent electronically, which  was very convenient for people who were always on the move, like  Alala.  The little postal robot looked at her for a moment before  reaching out a short, flat appendage that lit up—it was a monitor.</p>
<p>Would  you like to check your mail? it asked her.  Alala felt her stomach knot  up as she realized she had not looked at her inbox since before leaving  on this trip.</p>
<p>“Oh, uh, yeah.  I am Alala of Tigris.”  She placed  her paw on the monitor and opened her eye for retina scan; voice and  palm print match confirmed it was her.  Predictably, most of the  letters were junk, and a few screamed out for her to pay her school  bills, but one in particular caught her eye.  It was from her mother on  Tigris, whom she had not heard from in years.  She opened the letter  with childish excitement and read; her eyes bulged wider and wider the  further down she went.</p>
<p>“What is it, kitten?” Yenae purred.  Alala was too stunned to show the annoying woman any ire.</p>
<p>“It’s  a wedding invitation from my mother,” she whispered.  “She…she’s  getting remarried.  She wants me to be her maid of honor.”</p>
<p>“Oh  goody, a wedding!”  Yenae threw her arms around Alala’s waist and  rubbed her cheek against her shoulder, yet even this did not disturb  her.  “It sounds fun!  Does it say you can bring a guest?  I want to go  too and see what kind of wonderful person this mother of yours is!  But  wait, if this is on Tigris, then…  Ah!  We get to see the planet of  cat-girls!”</p>
<p>“Get off,” Alala said emptily, shaking Yenae away.   “It’s not that simple.  I haven’t heard from her since before I entered  high school, and she drops this on me?  The…nerve of that bitch…”</p>
<p>“But  don’t you love your mommy?” Yenae pouted.  “This is supposed to be a  happy occasion!”  Alala suddenly exploded, throwing the defenseless  postal robot away with a thrust of her arms.</p>
<p>“HOW CAN THIS BE  HAPPY WHEN I HAVEN’T HEARD ANYTHING FROM HER IN SEVEN YEARS?!  SHE  NEVER EVEN BOTHERED TO CALL ME AND WAS PROBABLY FUCKING WITH THIS OTHER  WOMAN AND HAVING THE TIME OF HER LIFE WHILE I WAS SUFFERING IN  SCHOOL!!  I’M GONNA REAM HER WHEN I SEE HER AGAIN!!  COME ON!!”  And  not even knowing who she was grabbing, the infuriated cat-girl swiped  Yenae’s wrist and dragged her along, her eyes aflame and her teeth  bared.  Yenae was surprised, to say the least, and was also  shamed—mostly because she finally realized she was infatuated with a  woman she barely knew anything about.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe this sudden layover would change all that.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             Amy and the Acheron sisters seemed fine about redirecting their  path—Tigris was quite a good distance away, but they would be able to  make it in time—but in order to satisfy their curiosity, they asked  Alala why she was so angry at her mother.  Of course, in order to  understand that, she had to explain a lot of other stuff, and with  people interrupting her every so often (which led to one emotional  outburst or another), it became difficult to hear the whole story.  But  what it boiled down to was this.</p>
<p>            While Tigris was  certainly not the only planet where the Felinis people lived (just as  Gaea was not the only world exclusive to humans), it did boast the  remarkable phenomenon of having females take up its entire populace.   According to its history, a devastating plague about 200 years earlier  wiped out the entire male population, even going so far as to prevent  any future children from coming out male.  On the other hand, it did  give the surviving women the amazing ability to reproduce within their  own sex, and given the nymphomaniacal and polygamist nature of the  Felinis people, the population was easily replaced in a matter of  decades.</p>
<p>            Alala was not a purebred Felinis but  actually the bond between cat-girl and a human woman.  Her two mothers,  Diona and Clarissa, met when Clarissa, her human mother, visited Tigris  to study Felinis architecture.  Diona had hitherto been flirtatious and  free with her sexuality, but something about Clarissa made her choose  to devote all her love to this woman, to the disappointment of the  other cat-girls.  Not even Alala knew how Felinis women got other women  pregnant, but Clarissa had a child nevertheless, and Alala was born.   Clarissa was a sickly woman, though, and in spite of all Diona’s  efforts, she passed away quietly when Alala was still a child.  The  only memories she had of her birth-mother were pictures, portraits, and  stories.</p>
<p>            “Now don’t get me wrong,” she pointed to the  entranced crew.  “I’m not against this wedding at all.  My mother has  been a widow for fifteen years and it’s high time she found someone  again.  If it were that simple, I’d have all the happiness in the  world.  But she never even told me she was dating again, much less  getting married!”  Alala then went on to explain that she had spent the  last seven years of her life abroad, in Phobos and Ares academies, the  toughest schools that Mars had to offer (why Mars?  Clarissa was born  and educated on Mars, and it was the only real school Alala knew about).</p>
<p>             “That alone was good enough to get her aboard this ship,” Amy said to  the crew.  “Merely attending those schools is a feat itself, but she  got valedictorian for both.  I only know of three other people who  accomplished that feat, and one of them is the current Director for the  UCM.”</p>
<p>            “Anyway, mom never kept in touch for some strange reason, so you can understand why I’m so angry.”</p>
<p>            “At least you’ve calmed down!” Shana squealed.</p>
<p>            “Yeah, for now.  I can’t be angry for long, but once I see her again, I’m gonna give her a piece of my mind.”</p>
<p>            “Just don’t ruin the wedding,” Amy sighed.  Alala snorted and crossed her arms.</p>
<p>             “That goes without saying.  I’m only gonna give her what she’s got  coming.  I’m not stupid.”  The crew slowly scattered again and prepared  themselves for a visit to Tigris; Yenae felt a quiet sensation of joy  burning in her spirit that had very little to do with happiness.  She  always knew Alala was smart and adored her for that unsung brilliance,  but it was also clear she had lived through the worst of what life had  to offer, and emerged strong, proud, cynical, and defiant for it.  She  so desperately loved Alala for that invincible will of hers that  sometimes, she felt unworthy of her presence.  How could a goddess like  her ever love a mere woman like Yenae?  For all her personal  achievements and glories, she couldn’t even touch Alala’s strength and  dignity—but that only made her love the young woman more.  Yes, she  teased her, but only out of the purity of that love…and it really did  look like the kitten enjoyed it.</p>
<p>            Thanks to the speed of the <em>Dauntless</em>,  the peerless skills of the Acheron sisters, and a bit of teleportation  magic courtesy of Rachel (who loved weddings and cats just as much as  anybody), the crew made it to the exotic jungle world of Tigris with  time to spare.  Its spaceport was fairly primitive compared to modern  standards, and its technology was only slightly on part with 18th  century Gaea; the world was mostly covered with lush vegetation, small  mountains, grand oceans, and clusters of buildings that barely passed  as villages.  Once the <em>Dauntless</em> touched down and released its  crew (or at least those who wanted to come along), a throng of exotic,  sensual, sleek cat-girls came out to greet them, most of them already  dressed for the upcoming wedding, while some were simply not dressed at  all.  Their eyes bulged and their hearts raced as they saw all the  beautiful foreign women coming down to greet them, but one in  particular showed more love than all of them put together.</p>
<p>             It was fairly easy to see the family resemblance.  While Alala  inherited her birth-mother’s wild, fluffy, short silvery hair, it was  obvious where she got her big, bright, sharp green eyes.  Diona’s  womanly body was not a genetic trait they shared (though years of  practicing contortionism might have made Alala skinnier than most), but  they had the same wavy tail, the same pointy eats, the same pink nose  and lips, and the same sharp chins (Clarissa gave her daughter that  innocent oval face).  Diona pushed her way through the crowd and hugged  Alala fiercely, and for a moment, the feisty cat-girl forgot about her  anger.</p>
<p>            “You made it!  I’m so happy!  Here, let me  take a look at you.”  Alala’s eyes filled to the brim with tears—no  amount of rage can suffocate the bliss of a reunion—and she smiled with  love.  But then she remembered how mad she was and pushed her mother  away.</p>
<p>            “It’s good to see you, mom…but why the HELL DIDN’T YOU TELL ME you were getting MARRIED!?”</p>
<p>            “I’m sorry, honey buns; I didn't want you to be upset and take away from the fun you were having at school—“</p>
<p>             “Fun?  What fun?!” she shrieked.  “I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH NOTHING BUT  SHIT FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS!”  She went on to describe the ghastly  details of her hellish experiences, and because she had been holding it  in for so long, nobody dared to interrupt her.  “Everybody picked on  me, ya know why?  Because I was nothing but a sex-crazed catgirl to  them!  And I didn’t have any more money after I spent everything you  gave me!  And I was smarter than them!  I got beat up a lot, too, and I  never had any friends—except…except one, who saved me, who I fell in  love with, but she…she screwed with me and disappeared after graduation  without ever saying a word!  She left me just standing there at that  bus stop, freezing my tail off!</p>
<p>            “But that’s only the  beginning!  When I got to Ares, I fell in love again…and we…we really  had something.  She loved me back…but then she got engaged…she broke my  heart, mom…her parents wouldn’t let us stay together because I was just  some dirt-poor <em>cat-girl</em> to them…and she didn’t even put up a  fight!  I was so angry, sad, confused, frustrated, heartbroken,  devastated…I couldn’t do anything but cry!  And all this time, you were  fucking around with some other woman…ugh, I’m sorry, no offense,  wherever you are, I’ve got nothing against <em>you</em>…you were having all this fun and you didn’t even TELL ME you’re getting married!!”</p>
<p>            “But you never told me any of THIS!” Diona screamed.  “Why didn’t you ever send me any letters?”</p>
<p>             “I don’t know!” she screamed, her eyes flinging tears.  Diona’s temper  flared up as well—another trait the two shared.</p>
<p>            “I’M YOUR DAMN MOTHER, ALALA! YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TELL ME THESE THINGS!!”</p>
<p>             “YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED!!”  And so it went on as  mother and daughter screamed at each other.  Even the bravest  crewmembers didn’t want to be anywhere near that Maelstrom, and slowly  backed away.  A few started to have more respect for Alala, though,  after hearing her tale of sorrow—especially Naja, who suddenly found  herself attracted to more than just the cat-girl’s looks.</p>
<p>            “Should we interfere?” Lyara wondered.</p>
<p>             “Don’t,” said one of the cat-girls—a tall, tawny, serene-looking lady  with long fangs that reached to her chin—she was a rare saber-toothed  cat-girl.  “This is a matter that mother and daughter must settle.  I  will wait until the storm has cleared.  Are you Alala’s friends?”</p>
<p>            “Most of us,” Naja muttered.  The woman smiled and bowed slightly.</p>
<p>             “My name is Calliope.  I’m the current high priestess of Tigris, and  Diona’s fiancée.  I’ve heard a lot of things about my future  stepdaughter, and I must admit, the stories don’t do her justice.   She’s even stronger and more beautiful in person.”</p>
<p>            “She certainly is,” Yenae sighed.  “So if you’re the high priestess, who’s going to perform the ceremony?”</p>
<p>             “A special guest,” Calliope said proudly.  “Normally, it’s my job to do  this sort of thing, and to watch over our religious affairs.  We may be  a sexually frivolous race, but that doesn’t mean we don’t believe in a  higher power.  My forerunner will be handling the ceremony today.   She’s a friend of Diona’s as well, so it’s a matter of love and honor.   I’ll introduce you once they stop bickering—oh, it seems they’ve  already reached a happy medium.”  Calliope smiled and watched as the  squalling stopped and the two cat-girls finally made up, tears busting  from their eyes.</p>
<p>“All I ever wanted was for you to be happy!”  Diona sobbed.  “I'm sorry if I messed up on that, but no matter how  pissed you are, you're still the best thing that’s EVER happened to me  and I'll always love you!!”  Alala nodded fiercely and squeezed her  mother tight.</p>
<p>“I love you mom!” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Oh, I love  you too grumpy butt!”  The cat-girl crowd and most of the crew fawned  loudly at such a heartwarming display; they couldn’t help it.  Yenae  just cackled to herself in spite of how happy she was that all was well.</p>
<p>“Hee-hee-hee!  ‘Grumpy butt’!  I’ll have to remember that one!  Heheheh!”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             With that matter settled, Alala assumed the role of excited daughter,  stepdaughter, and maid of honor, and formally introduced herself to  Calliope, slipping several apologies in.  Calliope understood how hurt  her future stepdaughter was and didn’t blame her for it; she was just  glad the two had made up again.  She was a kind, soft-spoken,  beautiful, humble woman, and Alala grew to like her a lot (of course,  everyone started to wonder what it was like having sex with a  saber-tooth cat-girl, but they just assumed Diona enjoyed it since she  made no attempts to hide her affection).  The real treat came later on,  though, when the former Felinis high priestess was revealed.</p>
<p>             Every religion has their unique figurehead that all future successors  aspire to follow.  Hinduism has Mohandas Gandhi, Buddhism has Siddartha  Gautama, and Christianity has an army of saints and servants—and these  are just the Gaean faiths.  For the Felinis people across the Milky  Way, Marsa Rosemont was their role model—the woman they looked up to,  believed in, and followed.  Her beauty, grace, wisdom, and insight  seemed to keep growing with every year passed—and she was older than  Alala’s mother.  She was a patient, calm, generous, saintly woman, who  extended her tender heart out to all creatures and strove to love those  whom society deemed unlovable.</p>
<p>            But Marsa Rosemont was  also a revered heroine and warrior.  She used her influence and  strength to lead the Felinis through dark times, particularly when  roving bands of slave traders invaded their world.  Tigris might have  been stripped bare of its resources and its people would have been  shackled and caged if it hadn’t been for her.  Marsa’s true claim to  fame, though, was her ability to communicate with the spirit world,  particularly the dead.  She could even summon a specter from “the other  side” for seven hours, to partake in its wisdom and knowledge.  Even  outsiders considered her a holy woman—but Marsa had her quirks, too.   She showed no interest in the orgies and romances of her world, and  never gave in to sexual gratification; she claimed to prefer males  anyway, and put herself in exile in order to escape all that nonsense.   But she was back now, and for the moment, glad to be home.</p>
<p>             “I’m afraid I won’t be able to stay for long, though,” she said to the  group.  “I am only here for three days, and then I’ll have to be on the  move again.”</p>
<p>            “So what’s more important than visiting  dear friends?” Diona teased her.  Marsa smiled sadly; she tried not to  let her grave face show on this beautiful occasion.</p>
<p>             “I simply have some business to attend to.  My services are required.   But I’ll be here long enough to see you two on your way.  Dr. Miracle,  could you please escort your crew to the main square?  It’s an open  area enclosed by gardens and a fountain.  Please feel free to sit  anywhere you like.”  Miracle thanked her and led the way; now it was  just the former priestess, the two brides, and their maids of honor.</p>
<p>            “What should I be doing?” Alala said.</p>
<p>             “I need everybody to come with me.  Calliope, Diona, you already know  what we’ll be doing, so if either of you would like to explain…”</p>
<p>            “I think we’d all rather hear you say it, Mother Rosemont,” they grinned.  Marsa chuckled sweetly.</p>
<p>             “You don’t have to be formal with me.  Well, for those of you who don’t  know, a ritual of purification is required before the wedding ceremony  can commence.  Alala, Norn, the two of you and I will follow the brides  into the sacred pool.  We must remove our clothing and prepare pure  garments suitable for the ceremony.”</p>
<p>            “Y-you mean…we’ll all be <em>naked</em> together?”</p>
<p>             “There’s nothing sexual about it,” Marsa assured her.  “Calliope and I  have both performed this many times.  It’s a very holy ritual, my  dear.  The three of us are responsible for cleansing the brides and  making sure they are prepared for their journey together.  This honor  can only be given to somebody the bride trusts with her life.”</p>
<p>             “Oh.”  Her face flushed pink as she understood why Diona chose her as  maid of honor.  “So mom, who’d you get before this?”</p>
<p>             “I had your aunt Mavery perform the honors.  Clarissa chose her rival  for my affections; they had grown to become very unlikely friends.”   Alala nodded and breathed deep as she prepared herself.  The five of  them passed through the thick curtain of a weeping willow into an open  pond, with waters as clear as crystal and cool to the touch.  Alala and  Norn undressed the brides first, then removed their own clothes as they  followed the women inside the water.  Although Diona and Calliope  seemed totally at ease with each other, Alala was a little nervous.   She calmed down a little once she saw how frantic her stepmother’s maid  of honor was, and reached out to hold her hand.</p>
<p>            “It’s cold!” she exclaimed zestfully.  Norn grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>            “Yeah.  Your mother’s really pretty.”</p>
<p>            “Hey, are you checking her out?”</p>
<p>             “You’d better get an eyeful, Norn,” Calliope called as she waded close  to her bride-to-be.  “This is the last time I’ll let anybody ogle my  Diona.  Whenever you’re ready, Marsa.”  Rosemont braced herself and  undressed quickly.  She had pretty ginger fur and meek eyes that  flashed with hidden strength; however, the eyes clenched shut and the  fur shivered as she waded in.</p>
<p>            “I’ve forgotten how  cold it is!” she giggled.  She shivered and laughed, then became a  little more serious as she approached the brides and took their hands.   “The two of you will soon be bound for life,” she chanted, “and so let  this ritual cleanse you of your pasts so that you may begin anew.  Let  you not be shamed by one another, but delight in each other’s company.   Let Diona serve and honor Calliope and let Calliope cherish and obey  Diona.  Have no more dreams; have waking delights together.  Be not two  women but one team.  Do not grow cold to love, but be intimate and  fruitful.  Blessed be the goddess of our world who is called <em>Tigress</em> in our language, and in the ancient tongue, <em>Felindra</em>,  archon of the world of those descended from the great cats, able to  bear children with their own gender.  Blessed be she and her Master and  all those gathered here.</p>
<p>            “Alala, Norn, please come here and cleanse these women who love one another.”</p>
<p>             It was difficult at first to wash her mother’s body.  Even though Alala  loved her deeper than she could ever describe, it was awkward pouring  water over that naked body and guiding it where it needed to go.  But  soon she understood what Marsa said when she said this was a holy  ritual:  there was no shame or discomfort in her actions.  Pure love  poured out of her body and into her hands; Diona was being cleansed and  baptized with love.  A beautiful, quiet smile drew out of her mouth,  and she glanced over to see that Norn was now at peace.</p>
<p>            “I missed you, mom,” Alala whispered.</p>
<p>             “I missed you too, sugar muffin.  I promise I’ll try and keep in touch  with you from now on, but you’ll have to do your part, too.”</p>
<p>             “Ahuh, I will.  And I’m really happy for you, mom—for both of you.  I  know you’re going to have a wonderful life together.”</p>
<p>            “What about you?” Calliope said.  “I want to see my future stepdaughter happy as well.  Are you in love yet?”</p>
<p>            “Maybe,” she whispered bashfully.  “I don’t know.  I’ll have to see first.”</p>
<p>             “Take your time, dear.”  Calliope grinned—what a smile the saber-tooth  cat-girl had!—and splashed a little water on Marsa’s face.  The former  high priestess squealed and fought back, and soon Norn was in on the  game as well.  Alala was about to join in when she noticed something  strange about her mother.  While she had been clothed, the woman’s  girth had been hidden, but now her beautiful nudity revealed a rather  startling revelation.</p>
<p>            “Uh, mom?  Is it just me, or…are you a little plump down there?”</p>
<p>            “Oh, right!  I almost forgot to tell you, fuzzy-heart!  I’m pregnant!”</p>
<p>             The splashing, the laughing, the shrieking, the rippling of waves—all  creation seemed to stop at once as Alala was slapped with this news.</p>
<p>            “Heh…heh…heh…you’re what?”</p>
<p>             “I’m pregnant!  You’re going to have a little sister soon!”  Alala  grinned maliciously and reached out to pinch her mother’s cheeks.  She  stretched them out until poor Diona wailed quietly, all the while  seething with frustration.  “MOOOOOOO-THEEEEEEERRRRRR, WHY DO YOU KEEP  HIDING THINGS FROM ME?!”</p>
<p>            “I’m sorry, I’m sorry—things were moving too fast for me to tell you!”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             It was very difficult for most of the crew to behave themselves while  they waited for the ceremony to begin.  As much as the other people of  Tigris loved sharing their affections with each other, they liked  foreigners even more, as Rebecca could personally vouch for (in fact,  she even recognized several old “friends” from her last trip here).   The only reason the two sides didn’t break out into a massive lesbian  orgy was because the Felinis people had all made personal promises to  stave off their urges until after the ceremony.  It would shame and  dishonor the two brides if they came out of the pool only to discover a  massive heap of bodies engaged in carnal affairs, and as much as the  Tigris ladies loved sex, they wouldn’t dare disappoint two very dear  friends.  But of course, once the ceremonies were over, all restraint  would be cast to the side.</p>
<p>            “I wish this would hurry up,” Chandra sighed.</p>
<p>            “Me too,” Naja groaned.  “Hey, you think they’d mind if we snuck off and had a little ‘pre-game warm-up’?”</p>
<p>             “I’m sure they wouldn’t if we were discreet about it,” she giggled.   They didn’t even get the chance to stand up, though, as Marsa Rosemont  emerged from the willowy curtain dressed in her old traditional  priestess gown.  It was a humble white peplos, a sort of toga similar  to the type of dress worn by ancient Greek women, and a crown of lilies  circled her head.  Diona and Calliope came in from opposite sides,  escorted by their maids of honor; all five of them were beaming and  glorious.  Marsa understood how impatient everybody was and decided to  keep this one short and simple.</p>
<p>            “Twenty years ago, I  stood on this same spot to bless the union of Diona and Clarissa, two  women of different worlds who, in spite of their diversity, managed to  find love together.  Although the passing of our dear friend Clarissa  was tragic, Diona has found the strength to move on, and has since  opened her heart to another.  Ten years ago, I left this world we all  love to spread my message across the stars, and while my absence was  mourned, I felt assured that by leaving my dear Calliope in charge, the  goddess Tigress would smile down upon you and there would be prosperity  greater than what I have sown.  Today, now, we join these worthy souls  in the bonds of marriage—a rarity on this world, I must admit, and all  the more precious because of this rarity.  I am sure everyone is in  favor of this union, but if there is one among you against such a  blessed match, feel free to speak.”</p>
<p>            “You’ll have me  to answer to if I hear a single peep!” Alala growled.  The crowd, the  brides, and even Marsa laughed, and no objections were made.  Diona and  Calliope wept for joy as they sealed their union, and Alala fell upon  them, wailing happily even before Marsa could announce them as a couple.</p>
<p>             A day and a night passed.  For those who wished to attend, there was a  wedding celebration held after the ceremony—though calling it a  celebration seems a little tame since it was little more than an orgy  involving most of the guests, and even a few people from the <em>Dauntless</em> attended.  When morning came, the delightful absurdity of girls loving  girls roused those who had slept in late, and Marsa Rosemont quietly  dismissed herself for her next task.  Instead of hailing a ferry from  the Ozmund Company, like she did when she arrived, Marsa went straight  to Amy Miracle, who had spent the night alone in one of the hotels.   She was a bit surprised to see such a lovely woman sleeping all by  herself, but she just figured not everyone was into mindless lesbian  cat-girl sex.  She certainly wasn’t.</p>
<p>            “Good morning,”  Miracle sighed as she stretched and yawned.  She looked much older with  her hair flowing so freely, but she also looked very attractive as  well:  not merely beautiful, but magnetic and charming and even  compelling.  Marsa could understand why so many people were drawn to be  members of her crew, and quietly admitted to herself that she felt that  same unexplainable love.</p>
<p>            “Good morning, Dr. Miracle.  Did you sleep well?”</p>
<p>             “Hardly,” she groaned as she rubbed her eyes.  She also didn’t have her  glasses on; their absence made her look even more womanly and mature.   “I was up half the night trying to drown out all those sex noises.  Are  they like this all the time?”</p>
<p>            “It was a special  occasion today,” she explained.  “Group sex usually isn’t their thing,  or at least it wasn’t when I lived here.  At most, they usually have  three or four women at a time, but anything goes on Tigris.”</p>
<p>            “I see.  Well, you came all this way to see me, so what can I do for you?”</p>
<p>             “I was actually hoping you could do me a big favor.  I came here out of  love for Diona and Calliope, but my real destination is Rajani, the  so-called ‘dark planet’.”</p>
<p>            “Because of the curse.”   Amy stared directly into Marsa’s eyes and held the gaze with surprising  firmness.  The former priestess nodded quietly.</p>
<p>            “I’ve  been asked to lift it, if I can.  This will be very difficult and I was  wondering if you and your crew could lend me a hand.  The only thing I  can pay you with is my gratitude, of course…”</p>
<p>            “No,  don’t even think about that.  I’d be glad to help you.  You see…”  She  pulled her right foot out from the covers and unwrapped the bandage,  which was now almost soaked with blood.  A little trickle still bubbled  out of the wound, and Marsa gasped sharply.  She jerked out of her seat  and backed away, waving her hands defensively as she shook in terror.   Amy sighed and calmly redressed her injury.</p>
<p>            “So you  do know what this is.  Perhaps there is a way you can pay me back after  all, Lady Rosemont.”  Marsa slowly calmed down and tried to smooth out  her jitters.  She took a seat and rubbed her face; her hand came back  damp with sweat.</p>
<p>            “That does seem like a fair  exchange.  I can’t guarantee you anything, doctor, but I’ll do what I  can.  Just tell me one thing:  where did you get that?”  Amy took a  deep breath, raised her face to the ceiling, closed her eyes, and  quietly chanted—or sang—something that sounded like the fragment of an  epic poem, or a prophecy.</p>
<p>            “T’was wrought upon my sole along the shores of Death’s ferryman.”</p>
<p>            “And is this place close to your birth?”</p>
<p>            “In the cradle of the god of wealth, guardian of the underworld, did this Miracle come into being.”</p>
<p>            “What manner of creature gave you that mark?”</p>
<p>            “The one I have been destined to struggle against since my own mother began to age.”</p>
<p>            “And where is this creature now?”</p>
<p>             “The seed has been sown into the earth, and it is our human right to  reap…or crush.”  Marsa took a deep breath as well, and helped Amy braid  her hair.</p>
<p>            “I’m ready to leave whenever you are.  I’ve already said my farewells.”</p>
<p>             “That’s good.  You should always tell the people you care about when  you’re coming or going.  We’ll be ready to leave in two hours.  The  hard part will be trying to convince everyone to leave this place.   Lucky for me, the god of wealth gave birth to me.  How else do you  think I was able to enlist so many?”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             Just as Amy predicted, it was nearly impossible getting most of the  crew to leave their new sweethearts.  She knew she had promised them  that they could come and go as they pleased, but she also felt it would  not do any of them much good to stay on this planet, when their true  hearts were devoted to adventure, glory, and exploration.  During this  time, Yenae quietly pulled Diona aside, and smiled at her.  The  newly-married cat-girl had never seen a woman with horns before, but  she thought they were rather lovely and didn’t flinch.</p>
<p>            “Yes, can I help you?”</p>
<p>            “You’re Alala’s mother, right?  You two look a bit alike.”  Diona grinned.</p>
<p>            “I’m afraid she got most of her beauty from her other mother, Tigress rest her soul.  Are you a friend of hers?”</p>
<p>             “Yes, but she doesn’t know it yet.  Listen—I have a confession to make,  but this may seem a little awkward for both of us.  You see, Miss  Diona, I’m in love with your daughter.”  Diona suddenly gasped for joy  and reached out to embrace Yenae, but she was held back.  “Don’t make a  scene!  I don’t want her knowing yet—not like this, anyway.  I want to  prove to her how strong my love is.  Your daughter is the most amazing  woman I’ve ever known, and I’ve met some very brilliant people in my  lifetime.  I fell in love at first sight and I’ve grown fonder of her  ever since.  Of course, I don’t know how to tell her, so I just keep  teasing her.”</p>
<p>            “I think that’s the best way to go  about it,” Diona giggled.  “Alala is a very sweet, caring, kindhearted  young woman—she can just be a little temperamental at times.  She gets  that from me.  I think what she needs more than anything is someone who  will love her unconditionally…someone who will stay by her side even  when it hurts…someone who will fight for her, and challenge her.”</p>
<p>             “I promise, I will do all of that and more.  I just want your  blessings.”  Diona smiled sweetly and drew Yenae in for a rough hug.</p>
<p>             “I’d be happy to have someone as sweet as you as my future  daughter-in-law.  I know she’ll be leaving soon…she always has been a  big fish in a small pond…so I want you to take care of her.  Um…what’s  your name, dear?”</p>
<p>            “Yenae, Yenae Gwen Marliir.”</p>
<p>             “What a pretty name!  Please watch out for her, Yenae dear…and come  visit us soon!  I’d be more than happy to give my daughter away to  you.”  They hugged again, but were separated suddenly as Alala pulled  Yenae away.</p>
<p>            “Hey, what do you think you’re doing?  My mother’s a married woman now!”</p>
<p>            “I know!  We were just exchanging pleasantries, ‘grumpy butt’!”</p>
<p>            “Grumpy?  MOTHER, WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING HER?!”</p>
<p>            “Nothing at all, sugar muffin!”  Yenae laughed out loud along with everyone else in range.</p>
<p>            “That’s even better!  ‘Sugar muffin’!  I love it!  Got any more?”</p>
<p>            “Oh, dozens!”</p>
<p>            “MOOOOOOOOM, WHY DO YOU GOTTA EMBARRASS ME LIKE THIS!?”</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter:</u></em></p>
<p>Kyrie:  Yo, I haven’t been seen for a long time!  Wassup with that?</p>
<p>Vimmy:   I’ve noticed that nobody’s paid much attention to me either, I’ve  certainly been watching everyone myself, I have to say that being cast  aside doesn’t feel very good… (blah, blah, blah)</p>
<p>Herut:  The next  chapter has the idiotic crewmembers going to a dark planet to lift a  terrible curse.  Why do things like this keep happening to us?</p>
<p>Kyrie:  Who cares?  I need some star time!  And fire!  And sex!</p>
<p>Rachel:  I’ve barely been mentioned and I don’t mind at all!</p>
<p>Vimmy:   Yes, but who could ever forget a genie, whereas I keep getting the  short end of the stick, but I am the richest person onboard, I have to  keep track of finances and important business deals… (yak, yak, yak)</p>
<p>Herut:  All this excitement and more in, “The Dark World:  lifting a curse on a wing and a prayer!”</p>
<p>Kyrie:  And hopefully more lines!</p>
<p>Herut:  That too.</p>
