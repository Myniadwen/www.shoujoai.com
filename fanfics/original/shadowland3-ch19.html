<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 19 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Sophia slowly pulled into the station parking lot and into an empty 
spot, then placed the car in park, &quot;Well, we are here.&quot; She glanced at 
her watch once again, &quot;If we hurry we will make it on time. We don&#39;t 
want to leave the girls awaiting now do we?&quot; She commented as she opened 
the door and locked it before closing it after her.

Jessica did the same and glanced across at the old train station before 
them. It had been so long since she too arrived on that same train, 
ticket in her pocket and dreams of a safe place to stay. She recalled 
stepping off that train to find Sophia and Melissa awaiting her arrival. 
It was still a mystery to her how these two knew she would be arriving 
or why they even had an opening for her at the academy; but at that time 
she was grateful for their offer. She was so cold and hungry that she 
saw the two Head Mistresses as angels in the darkness. Since being Head 
of the Western Dorms she has witnessed many strange things that she had 
filed her meeting with the Heads of the school as just a normal 
occurrence at the school.

Sophia wrapped a scarf around her neck and started towards the front 
entrance of the train station, and then stopped and offered a hand to 
Jessica, &quot;You coming?&quot; Jessica took the woman&#39;s hand and noticed how 
warm it felt. She followed the Head Mistress towards the large stone 
entry to the building. There were two giant stone pillars that towered 
to either side of the entrance making Jessica feel tiny and 
insignificant. She huddled close to the Head Mistress as they passed 
through a set of glass double doors and into the station. The main lobby 
was massive, white and black marble floors rolled out before them across 
an interior that made Jessica think more of a ballroom then a train 
station. Off to either side stretched numerous ticket booths with brass 
bars to keep the workers secure. Red velvet rope drooped between brass 
stanchions to guide ticket buyers to the correct booths. However Jessica 
did not see any workers or travellers anyways in sight, she didn&#39;t see 
anyone for that matter, the place seemed deserted to her. 

Sophia looked up at a grand clock that hung over head taking up the 
entire ceiling, &quot;They should be here any minute now.&quot; Abruptly the air 
filled with the sound of rumbling, &quot;That must be them.&quot; Quickly she 
rushed across the marble floor, careful not to let her cane slip out 
from under her on the smooth marble floor, Jessica right at her side. 
Sophia stopped near a long set of stairs and glance at Jessica, &quot;Could 
you rush ahead of me? They should be on platform eleven. You will know 
who it is when you see them.&quot; Sophia hastily requested. 

&quot;Alright...&quot; Jessica puzzled for a moment on how she would know whom to 
look for when the air filled with the sound of a train whistle and she 
hopped down the stair as quickly as she could. Jessica quickened her 
pace, taking the stairs three at a time, she could hear the sounds of 
the train pulling in somewhere in the station and hoped that she would 
not be too late. She did not want to leave the girls lost and alone in 
such a large train station at this one. She landed upon the lower 
platform and scanned the signs, finding platform eleven was off to the 
right. She turned to see the train rolling into the large terminal, a 
maze of bridges and stairs leading everywhere. 

Afraid she may already be too late Jessica ran down the platform and 
discovered more signs which told her where to turns until she arrived at 
platform eleven. To her surprise she did not encounter another soul on 
her route. Not a single person seemed to come off the train as Jessica 
rushed down the platform in search of the new girl.
