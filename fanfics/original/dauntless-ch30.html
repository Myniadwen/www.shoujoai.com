<p>“Space Race: a great showdown!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>So much can happen in one  day—indeed, it really only takes an hour to <em>change</em> something. Kaori Chuunaru was quiet and awkward as she followed her  crew into the small space station orbiting the frozen Hagan 20.  Social situations had not been hammered into her nearly as hard as  they could have, and she ended up leaning off to the side, casually  watching as everyone else had their fun. Oh, she knew how to carry  herself in a more formal setting, and she wasn’t as harsh or direct  as her actions would lead you to believe—but it was hard for her to  let her hair down, mainly because she focused so <em>much</em> of her  time on her duties. One of her subordinates she had a fruitless crush  on brushed past her, smiled and offered a drink, and Kaori took it  eagerly.</p>
<p>“So this is Lady Damascus!” She  nearly retched and jerked her head to glare at Sati Yeriman, who had  been pawing and sniffling around up until then. It was difficult to  glare at her adorable face for long; she was bright, kind, and  loving, and wore her heart on her sleeve.</p>
<p>“And just where did you hear that  expression?” Kaori muttered darkly. Sati waved casually.</p>
<p>“From the friend of a friend, of  course.”</p>
<p>“You should probably forget you  ever heard that,” Eve said as she snuck up from behind, placing a  steely hand on Sati’s shoulder. She grinned lazily at Kaori and  used her finger like a gun. “Pow. Nice running into you, Chuunaru.  How’s the suit working?”</p>
<p>“You did a good job,” she nodded  curtly. “How’s your Zeta working?”</p>
<p>“He was great the last time I  checked. I still can’t believe I left him with the boss.”</p>
<p>“From the look of your company,  I’d say you forgot him in your haste. By the way, that bounty is  still out for you.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know,” she drawled,  removing herself from Sati, who made a beeline for Riene. “You can  keep it for as long as you like and raise it as high as you want, but  I’m still not joining up with you people. I’ve had my fill.”  Kaori approached her rapidly and drew so close that her impatient  breath splashed against Eve’s face.</p>
<p>“Don’t be so selfish, Kasberry.  I appreciate your commitment to freedom and independence, but don’t  let a talent like yours go to waste. The UCM can give you anything  you want, take you to any world you like, give you the best equipment  and funding, put you in the nicest house, give you the best crew…”</p>
<p>“But then I’d turn into a  military shill,” she countered coolly. “Thanks for the offer,  Kaori, <em>really</em>, but I’m gonna have to turn you down. It’s  not that I’m not flattered, it’s just…putting a bounty on  someone so you can force her back into your fold is really  disgusting.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You know I didn’t have anything  to do with that,” she snapped icily.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying you did. Our  relationship is peachy keen as far as I can see. It’s the rest of  the galaxy police I have trouble with.”</p>
<p>“Galaxy Police?” Fuuka chirped.  Athena sighed and snuggled her close.</p>
<p>“Don’t eavesdrop, Fuu-chan.”  Kaori ignored them and crossed her arms defensively.</p>
<p>“Why are you so antagonistic  towards us? You were only employed half a year, Kasberry—that’s  not long enough to make any enemies. Did we treat you poorly or not  give you what you needed? Was it because of that attack?”</p>
<p>“Hell no!” she exclaimed,  putting her hands on her head. Her mechanical eye scanned the room,  noticing how so many people were starting to pair up. Sati had just  kissed Riene in public, Shana and Mink were holding hands and  whispering intimately, Athena was gently kissing Fuuka’s neck and  shoulders while the good doctor blithely kept up a conversation, Naja  had her arms around Lil and Aseria, and Yenae was busy tickling  Alala’s ears. Even <em>Amy</em> was arranging something over a  monitor feed. It made Eve feel envious, isolated, and lonely, but  what good did love do for her? She had survived all this time without  it, right? She sighed and decided to answer Kaori before she got  impatient.</p>
<p>“I just didn’t want to be a part  of all that. Don’t get me wrong, Kaori: I don’t really hate the  military. I just hate the thought of losing myself in a group that  size. I wouldn’t be anything more than a rank and file drone. I  want to start my own business, be my own person. I don’t even care  if I fail—I just want to try.”</p>
<p>“And so that’s your answer.”</p>
<p>“That’s my answer,” she said  affirmatively. Chandra was wandering through the area around that  time and came across two beauties engaged in a mysterious discussion.  Since she was incapable of ignoring something so fascinating, she  popped in, chirped at Kaori, and saved Eve a world of trouble.</p>
<p>“Hello! You’re the woman we  talked to earlier, right? My word, you’re even more stunning in  person! I think I already know who you are, but why don’t we make  introductions anyway? I’m Chandra, the passionate one, a lover of  love. What grace has brought you here?”</p>
<p>“Captain Kaori Chuunaru,” she  stated. She blushed as Chandra batted her eyes and fought to keep her  gaze. Kaori knew it was rude not to look people in the eye when they  spoke, but it was tough to focus with the perfect vision of  loveliness grinning before her. “Y…you’re a pleasure unit,  right? Wait—you said your name is ‘Chandra’, right? Are you the  same Chandra who ran away from her owner in Andromeda Prime—and  stole his spaceship—and kidnapped a valuable repair unit?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Yes!!” Herut screamed,  gesturing vividly. “She’s the one! That’s the dirty whore who  ruined my life! You can arrest her now!”</p>
<p>“Behave yourself,” Valti said as  she ruffled Herut’s dark hair. “The good Captain’s not here to  make any arrests. If Shandra Hill didn’t do it, neither will Miss  Kaori!”</p>
<p>“It’s against the rules anyway,”  Kaori muttered as she brushed a particle of shame away. She was still  thinking about her truancy concerning the attack on the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>, and didn’t want to get mixed up in anymore moral  dilemmas. She gazed at Chandra a second time and saw the innocence  radiating in her eyes. Rules or not, she would never act against a  woman like her; there were bigger problems in life besides a lesbian  pleasure unit who committed grand theft.</p>
<p>“You mentioned something about a  date, if I’m not mistaken. I would like to see what you had in  mind, Miss Chandra. Perhaps you can alter my perception of your  criminal record.” Dear sweet Chandra lit up so brightly that it was  blinding; she squealed, latched around Kaori’s arm, and walked away  purring and humming merrily. Eve rolled her eyes: that earlier  sensation of isolation had just spiked. She grudgingly separated  herself from her crewmates and started wandering around the small  station, trying to adjust herself to the sporadic changes in gravity.  Most of the station was behaving itself and kept people pinned down  to the surface fairly regularly, but there were a few antechambers  Eve had to float through, their walls studded with bars and latches  to hang onto. She found herself half-hovering, half-walking into a  cafeteria, and spotted an empty table where she could rest. Of  course, being stuck in a crowd made her feel even more ostracized,  but at least it wasn’t punctuated by all that fuzziness she left  behind.</p>
<p>“Beautiful women shouldn’t sit  by themselves.” The voice startled Eve, and she jerked around only  to be kissed by two very soft, honey-sweet lips. Her heart jumped in  arousal, surprise, and even resentment as she saw the Jackal in front  of her, grinning sweetly and innocently, as if they had been lovers  forever. Eve croaked, incapable of proper speech. That was probably  for the best; words could not fit into this situation.</p>
<p>“Miss me much?” laughed the  older woman as she sat down. “We keep running into each other at  the weirdest places. It just goes to show that we’re destined to be  together. I’m actually here to watch the race, but I had a feeling  I’d see you here. I’ve got some money on that ship of yours, so  don’t let me down.” Eve’s face darkened as she numbly traced  circles on the table with her finger.</p>
<p>“I don’t actually drive it, I  just…help put some of it together.”</p>
<p>“Which means you’re still an  important part of the ship.” Quincy smiled and reached out to take  Eve’s hand; she didn’t jerk it back. “So how much time do you  have before you have to set out again?”</p>
<p>“We’re just stopping for the  night. I think our pilots are planning to run the rest of the way to  the finish line once we depart.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“The night, huh? That doesn’t  leave us much time. You know, there’s going to be a little dance in  the zero-g room later today. I don’t know if that’s your thing or  not, but <em>I’m</em> going, and I’d like you to be my date.” Eve  smiled shyly and nodded her head: wish granted. And how  serendipitous! She would have to show Lady Jackal she was not all  thumbs and left feet: Eve could take charge and fluster other people  as well. The rest of their day was spent as a dream; the whole night  slipped them by as they made love and slept peacefully in each  other’s arms.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“Damn it, I’m gonna be late! Why  the hell’d ya let me sleep in like that?! SHIT! Oof—damn it,  lousy friggin’ pants! Fuck this, I’ve gotta run! I’ll just put  the rest on in my room! I gotta leave, Quince—and if I see you  again, I’ll smack you so hard for keeping me up all night!”</p>
<p>The Jackal laughed out loud as she  watched Eve struggling to get dressed and leave before her crew  abandoned her. She <em>had</em> offered to give the fiery mechanic a  ride, but apparently Eve’s sense of duty to her ship and crew took  preference over everything else—not that it wasn’t an admirable  trait! Once little Kasberry dashed out of the room, Quincy crawled  over to the small articles of clothing her lover had left behind,  picked them up, and breathed in their scent. An undershirt, socks,  and a bra would make excellent trophies—and reminders that their  night together had been real.</p>
<p>Herut raised an intrigued eyebrow as  her hastily-dressed and windswept tutor burst into the ship, but  chose to stay quiet and not ask any questions. She was probably  better off not knowing, anyway. As Eve calmed down, Herut also  spotted Riene and Chandra walking on clouds, and grimaced as she  dared to imagine just what had transpired during that eventful night.  Chandra’s story would be easy to decipher, but Riene was another  matter. Did she finally get together with Rebecca, or had her  dalliance with Sati borne fruit?</p>
<p>“Whatever,” she muttered as she  went back to work. Aseria had volunteered to guide the <em>Dauntless</em> into the final stretch of the race, which was perfectly fine with the  Acheron sisters: they were tired of being isolated in the bridge, and  wanted to explore. A few of their crewmates still gave them  uncomfortable looks as they passed by, though they didn’t mean any  harm by it; the rest of the crew was more or less adjusted to their  unique appearance. Fittingly enough, Valti greeted them the warmest  and treated them like equals, probably believing that she would get  along better with her fellow “freaks”. Naja also acted  indifferently towards them, probably because a number of her own  species had two heads, but she spent more time with Lillianne than  the twins. They had a common enemy in Fuuka Fujiwara and became  unlikely friends because of it.</p>
<p>But back to Aseria’s trials. The  journey from Hagan 20 to the finish line on Centania was long,  grueling, stressful, and exhausting. It pitted a pilot’s skill and  stamina against the sheer emptiness and vastness of space: there were  no further checkpoints, and unless somebody flew completely off  track, there would be no celestial bodies to mark the passage of time  or distance. When Allegra asked Herut for a comparison, the young  mechanic answered that it would be like </p>
<p>going from Helios 8 (Neptune) to  Helios 3 (Gaia) nonstop, with every other planet in between obscured  by total darkness. Granted, nearly all modern vessels could make the  jump, but it would drain nearly all their reserves if they didn’t  pace things right. Aseria would therefore have to contend with  monotonous distance, any rivals that would come their way, preserving  fuel and supplies, and her own sanity before the end was over. It  wasn’t a very assuring assessment.</p>
<p>“That pointy-eared fruitcake’s  got enough screws loose,” the gunslinger exclaimed. “I heard Lil  say she has sex with her own sister! Ugh! And that’s <em>normal</em> compared to the other things I’ve heard them do--witchcraft and  demon-worship, summonin’ spirits and controllin’ the weather,  even rituals to suck away your soul! I won’t even touch the  Romanesque orgies they hold.”</p>
<p>“Orgies?” Chandra squealed.  Allegra snorted and dismissed her with a gesture.</p>
<p>“Go’way. I’m disgusted just  talkin’ about it.”</p>
<p>“And I’m sick of hearing it,”  Herut grunted. “So we have to rely on <em>her</em> to win this race  for us? I’d almost prefer Naja. She may be an obnoxious, selfish,  egotistical, backstabbing tyrant, but at least you can <em>count</em> on her doing that. Couldn’t we get anybody else to finish this up?  What about Amy?”</p>
<p>“That’s another thing, sug,”  Allegra sighed as she leaned back in her chair. “I keep askin’  her why she never flies her own ship, and she just feeds me the same  line over again: ‘Oh, you know, the Acheron sisters are doing a  better job.’ I love that gal, but she <em>could</em> be a lil’ more  proactive.”</p>
<p>“At least she gives us lots of  freedom.” Herut cast her eyes to where Chandra was seen last and  snorted. “Maybe too much freedom!”</p>
<p>“I do understand why you can’t  tolerate that hussy,” Allegra sighed. “She just ain’t ladylike  at all. I mean, it ain’t the whole Sappho-thing I’m against. Lord  knows I’ve done things a hundred times more shameful. If she could  just <em>commit</em> herself to someone and stick with them, I wouldn’t  have no problem.”</p>
<p>“She’d still be annoying, even  if she were a nun,” Herut concluded. She waved farewell to Allegra  and went back to work: the <em>Dauntless</em> was going to need her  full attention if it was going to survive this marathon.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Alala was doing everything she could  for the crew, if only to prove to them she was more than just an  adorable sex symbol, and while more people were beginning to respect  her and see her in another light, she still felt like their  perception was misconstrued. She knew deep in her heart that Yenae  was one of the few people that really admired and understood her, but  she preferred </p>
<p>to be in Miracle’s company. During  one of her breaks, she timidly walked into Amy’s room and was  invited to lay down on the older woman’s bed. Amy cradled Alala’s  head in her lap and softly petted her startling silvery hair,  sometimes touching her fuzzy ears. It was a sweet, serene feeling,  and the young Felinis almost fell asleep several times.</p>
<p>“Kyrie’s trying to think of a  way to make the ship go faster,” she reported numbly.</p>
<p>“Mm,” Amy hummed, “she must be  bored with no engine to maintain.”</p>
<p>“I knew she’d know why we had to  shut it off for this segment, and probably a few others knew, as  well. Yenae’s actually out there trying to explain it for all those  people who don’t speak scientist. I have to admit, as aggravating  as she it, there’s a sharp mind in that empty head of hers. Don’t  tell her I said that, okay?” Amy giggled and promised she wouldn’t.  She knew about Yenae’s feelings (everybody did by that point), and  was fairly certain that deep down, Alala was passionately drawn to  the free spirit; she just hadn’t come to terms with it yet. The  kitten yawned, stretched, and lazily waved her tail in the air.</p>
<p>“It’s almost too bad we can’t  keep using the engines, but what’s the point? We’re already going  as fast as we can, and we’re rationing our Lennethium. What do you  suppose will happen once we reach the finish line?” Amy smiled  sagely and stopped caressing for a moment.</p>
<p>“We’ll run into some familiar  faces, and there’ll be a chaotic struggle… But in the end, we’ll  cross that line. It really doesn’t matter to me what position we  end up in; I’m just glad for the experience. I would like to hurry  up a bit and concentrate on our next task.”</p>
<p>“That’s the one you promised to  do with Naja, right?” Alala flopped around so she was looking up,  and playfully batted Amy’s pigtails. “Why do you put up with that  she-devil, anyway? I mean, sure, she’s got her good points, but  come on! I’d rather hang around Yenae all day!”</p>
<p>“The Christian doctrine commands  us to love all,” Amy answered firmly. “Some people are just more  difficult to love than others. But deep down, I know that every  living creature wants others to love them. Some are just  inexperienced, or more unreceptive, or…not used to it. But there  are things about Naja, and all of you, that I find very easy to love.  In the end, she is very precious to me, because she has been given  the title of ‘Dauntless’…and we were both made by the same  hands.”</p>
<p>“Does this mean you love me too?”  Alala squeaked. Amy’s smile was golden and warm.</p>
<p>“Yes!! You’re very easy to  love.” Alala’s heart jumped, and she felt her eyes grow moist  from the elation she was feeling. It seemed worth all the trouble,  heartache, despair, and turmoil she had gone through in her life,  just to hear Amy say those words. For once there was someone who  loved Alala just for who she was, flaws and all, and that made her  happier than anything ever had.</p>
<p>“I love you too!” she whispered.  She sat up and touched Amy’s mouth with her own, taking hold of her  head with gentle hands--caressing, kissing. Amy jumped back quickly,  perplexed and </p>
<p>startled, her face red and her  glasses fogged up. She noticed Alala’s hurt expression and tried  settling her with a weak chuckle.</p>
<p>“Uh, I’m sorry…please don’t  be mad with what I just did. It’s not your fault, it’s mine.  People are always getting the wrong impression about me. I’ve  told…so many people that I love them, and they always get the wrong  idea. You’re not the first person--or even the first woman--that  was misled. I’m really sorry. I just <em>love</em> you, Alala, the  same way your mothers do. I care for you and I care about you. You’re  a great friend, but I can’t be anything more than that to you. You  really deserve better. Besides…and I probably should’ve said this  right from day one…I’m really not a lesbian. There are women I  love, but I can’t <em>love</em> them, not like that. Uh…is any of  this making sense, or am I just rambling?”</p>
<p>Alala stared at the floor for a  moment as she felt her heart being crushed once more. This was the  third time it happened…but it was certainly the easiest to bear.  Amy hadn’t been leading her on, and she had been so kind about  refusing Alala’s offer. She wanted to keep loving Alala; she wanted  her happy. The younger woman smiled sadly and slid her legs off the  bed.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s my fault as  well. I may have transcended the Felinis archetype, but I still have  a…sexual side. And I…I get misled too. My heart is a fickle,  foolish creature. I’m sorry for kissing you so suddenly.” Amy  grinned wearily and took her glasses off to clean them.</p>
<p>“It’s…not the first time a  girl’s kissed me. I’m afraid with this sort of crew, it may not  be the last!” Alala chuckled and stared at her friend with renewed  eyes; they sparkled like the phoenix whose potential is reborn and  renewed after a cleansing flame.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t mine either. I  think…I’ll go see if I can’t make myself more useful around  here. If you keep sitting in that bed, your other leg will wither up,  and soon your whole body’ll atrophy!”</p>
<p>“Good idea. I might take a dip in  the pool. Thanks for stopping by to chat.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for putting up with me,”  she grinned in return. Alala’s return to her duties had been  amazingly punctual: the ship’s readouts were indicating that a  swarm of competitors were crowding the spacious freeway, and it would  probably be a no-holds barred fight to the bitter end. Not even the  most dedicated race official bothered to flag anybody for aggression  at this stage in the game; it would be like trying to intervene in a  feeding frenzy.</p>
<p>“<em>Zephyr</em> and <em>Renegade</em> are ahead of us, and the <em>Einlanzer</em> and <em>Mishkin</em> have  caught up. Distance to finish line is fifty light-minutes and  closing. Raising particle shields and bracing for turbulence.”  Aseria had locked, bolted, and barred the door to the cockpit; not  even Lillianne would be admitted, not even if Aseria’s life was in  danger. She required total concentration to control and guide the <em>Dauntless</em> through this gauntlet; it was already shivering in  protest, and possibly fear as well.</p>
<p>“Two marks closing in from  starboard,” Shana reported. “They’re opening their boosters to  maximum. Our ETA is now at 48 and counting.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Fools,” Kyrie muttered as she  popped the top off a soda bottle. “What’s the point of using your  engines if you’re already at top speed? Don’t these idiots ever  take any physics classes?”</p>
<p>“I could frighten them away with  my reputation,” Yenae offered playfully. “Pirates and military  dogs all tremble at the mention of my name!” Alala rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“You mean ‘the Holy Annoyance’?  There’s a reason you have that nickname!” Yenae gasped and threw  her arms around poor Alala’s neck, squeezing her tenderly.</p>
<p>“Darling, did you just zing me?  You’re finally warming up to me! I’m so happy!”</p>
<p>“GAAH, get your demon cooties OFF  me!!”</p>
<p>“And now there are three from  stern side,” Shana deadpanned, ignoring their shenanigans. “We’re  running behind the <em>Zephyr</em>. It’s actually pretty quick for an  older model.”</p>
<p>“Kyle’s got some of the best  ships and pilots around,” Amy murmured. She pulled up a  communicator that channeled into the cockpit and barked into it:  “Aseria, activate Lennethium drive for seven point three seconds!  That should give us enough of a burst to wiggle our way out of this  mess! After that time has elapsed, decelerate until you reach  coordinates 17-456-90.”</p>
<p>“You know about that?” Herut  asked in surprise. Amy blushed humbly.</p>
<p>“I just learned about it from  Kyle.”</p>
<p>“What’cha talkin’ about?”  Valti said. Herut pointed to a spot on the monitor.</p>
<p>“You see that area? The screens  indicate there’s nothing there, but if you hit those exact  coordinates at a certain speed, an ether current will carry you off.  If we can manage to link onto that current, we’ll gain a distinct  advantage. It’s not an area that most outsiders know about.”</p>
<p>“You should’ve told us more  about this system so we’d have an advantage!” Naja sneered. Herut  returned her challenging gaze bravely.</p>
<p>“I’ve only lived on Centania.  Whatever I learn comes from the commercial and private pilots whose  ships I’ve fixed. Do <em>you</em> know everything about the Prayxus  system?”</p>
<p>“Not everything,” she countered  offensively. “But probably more than anyone here, ya little brat!!”</p>
<p>“That’ll be enough back there,”  Aseria commanded. “I swear, I don’t even <em>need</em> a radio to  hear you bickering! I have enough problems on my own. Shana, what’s  the status of our adversaries?”</p>
<p>“Four have passed us now, and two  are still neck-and-neck. We’ve got a clear path, though.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“All right, I’m going to  activate the Lennethium and set coordinates for the ether current.  Herut, is it possible to see on my readouts?”</p>
<p>“Just fly there and the current  will take care of everything.” Aseria grunted doubtfully.</p>
<p>“I’m not used to acts of blind  faith.” Everyone braced themselves for the sudden increase in speed  as the <em>Dauntless</em> moved beyond the spectrum of light itself and  folded time and space around its path. Aseria had programmed the ship  to move out at exactly 7.3 seconds, but something caused it to jump  out prematurely; it span out of control and rumbled fiercely.  Everyone screamed as Aseria fought to keep the ship steady—she  would have no assistance in doing so—and after several  gut-wrenching seconds, the vessel they had called their home became  stable once more.</p>
<p>“Ow,” Yenae groaned. Mink and  Kate helped her stand while Fuuka started going around checking to  see if everyone was all right. The damage was minimal, but now they  had no idea where they were, or what position they were in.</p>
<p>“S…status report,” Aseria  hissed. Yenae blearily squinted at the controls until she could get a  good reading.</p>
<p>“We were hit midway through the  jump by an unknown class of missile. I’m guessing it was fired  deliberately to catch us in the middle of L-drive and push us off  course. We haven’t been thrown very far, though, so it probably  wasn’t a direct attack. There are only two ships ahead of us, but  the distance is not that far.”</p>
<p>“So who did this?” Shana asked.  Yenae gave her a sour expression.</p>
<p>“Do you really need to ask? Ten to  one it’s the same guy that’s been on our back ever since this  race started. Shana, can you ID the <em>Backdraft</em> anywhere?”</p>
<p>“Well, I…oh, wait, here it is!  Not too far away, I think, and catching up fast. Whoa! Hey, we’d  better get moving! I think it’s about to fire again!!”</p>
<p>“Not if I can help it!” Allegra  shouted. She dashed off to the main guns with Eve at her side, and  nobody could stop them.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Yenae called. “I was  just about to say we’d better check to see if they can fire! Oh,  hell, forget about it! Aseria, evasive action! See if you can buy us  some time while we get the weapons back online!”</p>
<p>“You mean they’re <em>dysfunctional</em>,  at a time like this?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it must’ve been the shock  of coming out of an L-drive too soon. Are we anywhere near that ether  current?”</p>
<p>“Distance is two light-minutes,”  Shana stated. “The finish line is at 32 and closing!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“We’ll be fricasseed before  then!” Kyrie shouted. “I’m gonna go see if I can get the  engines moving! Becky, you’d better go check on our weapons!”</p>
<p>“I’m on it.” Everyone else  scrambled to make themselves useful as the <em>Dauntless</em> soared  through the heavens, racing not only against time and their rivals,  but the looming embrace of death itself. Aseria really proved her  mettle at the helm, and caressed the inky heavens like a celestial  bird, or the messenger of gods. The first missile blew up thanks to  Valti jettisoning the garbage, but two more ran out to replace it,  taking advantage of the confusion and the ship’s sluggishness.  Becky had her hands full trying to get the weapons back online, which  was quite frustrating for the two gunners who were fuming helplessly  in their seats. Shana and Alala were trying to reroute the ship’s  power to its thrust, but didn’t want to sacrifice its shield energy  in case they didn’t make it out in time, and Yenae worked with Naja  to keep operations running smoothly. Lil was there to calm and  encourage her partner, while the Acheron twins dropped hints and  suggestions. Everyone who was not kept busy by this crisis—and  there were very few of them—stepped out of the way and prayed for  success.</p>
<p>In spite of their efforts, however,  the <em>Dauntless</em> was knocked silly as one of the missiles struck  home, and the second one went off to increase the blast. Valti, who  took over monitoring outside activity for Shana, screamed that three  more missiles were coming their way, and poor, dear Herut was left to  wallow in anger as she reckoned what kind of damage all this would  deal to the ship. If they managed to survive, she would probably be  busy for months. As usual, she managed to blame Chandra for  everything (Chandra, meanwhile, had thrown herself at the nearest  woman and started smothering them with desperate kisses).</p>
<p>“Wait! Hold on a minute! The  missiles have detonated prematurely!” Valti covered her mouth so it  wouldn’t hang open, and double-checked her reading. “No two sides  about it, ladies: those little merchants of death are as good as  gone.”</p>
<p>“Duds?” Sharyn squeaked as she  pried Chandra away.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. They were…ah,  there’s our answer! Incoming vessel, ID is <em>Prince Mishkin</em>!  Becky, I could kiss that aunt of yours!”</p>
<p>“I’ll take you up on that  offer,” came Shandra Hill’s voice over the transmitter. “In the  meantime, you can leave this prick to my tender loving care. There’s  a large bounty on his head and I’m going to claim it when the race  is over.”</p>
<p>“Aunt Shandra!” Becky squealed  from the weapons room. “I thought you were going after the Dead  Roses!”</p>
<p>“First things first, Becky. Nobody  raises a hand to my niece and gets away with it. Not even the Dead  Roses are this bad. Stand clear, okay?”</p>
<p>“Copy that! Happy hunting!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Derian squealed for mercy and begged  the race officials to come to his aid as Shandra Hill pummeled him  with blasts and sonic disruptors, but his cries were unheard. The  crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> met with no further complications as  they crossed the finish line and ended the race.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Amazingly, the crew placed third in  rank despite all the recent trouble; only the <em>Zephyr</em> and <em>Renegade</em> had beaten them. That meant that the Ozmund’s  legendary vessel could retire on a high note, that Naja’s bargain  with Saki would be voided, and that the crew would be in the winning  circle to take home a portion of the prize. Of course, because the  aforementioned recent troubles had piqued their curiosity, the crew  split up so they could finish their business with the pilot of the <em>Backdraft</em>. This left the twins, Naja, and Aseria to soak up  their well-earned victory (Lyara would’ve bolted anyway); everyone  else met up with Rebecca’s aunt in the pursuit.</p>
<p>Vimmy Fonester’s influence and  wealth became indispensable once again as the petite entrepreneur  bribed her way through miles of red tape and security officers  (figuring that a portion of the earnings would go to her anyway). She  discovered that the <em>Backdraft</em> had been forced to drop out of  the race “through mysterious circumstances”, and was now  recovering at the docking station. Vimmy hired several cabs,  distributed comlinks, and sent the crew scattering, just in case  their enemy decided to give them the slip. As she predicted, the <em>Backdraft</em> had been completely abandoned, and according to  eyewitness testimony, a Pyrosian male had scrambled out and was  heading for the rental lot.</p>
<p>“Ah, you see, the perpetrator is  running scared, he would’ve left us if his ship were still in  shape, but we really must thank Miss Hill senior, yes, she did a  bang-up job blasting that thing apart, hmm, he’ll be on foot for  awhile, we’d better send a team to the rental lots around here and  intercept him, yes, I’ll keep making rounds on my side, I’m sure  I can ‘convince’ many more people to divulge this information,  what fun I’m having, I hope we catch him soon, I’d like to see  this scoundrel’s face!”</p>
<p>“And I’ll whoop the tar outta  him!” Allegra added. She grinned bashfully as Vimmy ended  transmission and stared at her.</p>
<p>“Saying things like that makes you  ladylike…how?”</p>
<p>“Aw, stuff it!”</p>
<p>Fittingly enough, Kyrie’s team  caught up with their enemy first. Kate and Athena tackled him and  pinned him to the ground, but he wriggled like a ferret and even  scratched them. Fuuka came by, gasped in fright, and stormed over to  avenge her beloved. Funny how a swift kick to the groin can calm  somebody down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Good work,” Athena said,  grinning sexily. Fuuka squealed happily.</p>
<p>“He had it coming. So who is he,  anyway? Kyrie, do you know him?”</p>
<p>“Nope, I’ve never seen this guy  in my life. Oh, quit whining, will you? It’s the least you deserve  after everything you put us through! Hey, the cavalry’s here!”  She waved her friends over as they drove by, and soon the entire  crew, plus Shandra and a few military officers, had gathered around  the disabled Pyrosian. Lillianne shoved them all aside as she  crackled her knuckles and cackled malevolently.</p>
<p>“Time to bring on the pain!!”</p>
<p>“We need to interrogate him  first,” said Amy as she held Lil back. “We have to find out who  he is, why he was after us, and who he’s working for.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m cool with that! I  never said I was gonna kill him. I just wanna wring him like a cloth  until he’s told us what we need to know. So start talking!” She  stepped on his ankle, crushing it instantly, and shivered giddily as  their prisoner started to howl.</p>
<p>“Good lord, woman!” Fuuka  barked. “Show some restrain! He may be our enemy but he still—“</p>
<p>“But nothing, bitch! And don’t  you step in to defend her, either!” she glared at Athena. Derian  suddenly broke out in a weak chuckle, and in spite of his pain, he  seemed to inflate with pride.</p>
<p>“Do your worst, Mulian scum! I  don’t care! Rip me up, chew me to pieces, dunk me in ice, suck out  my blood… There’s no way you’ll get me to say anything! No  amount of torture can compare to what’s in store for me if I talk,  so you may as well kill me!”</p>
<p>“You son of a…!” Lil dashed  after him in a rage, and had to be held back by five people,  including Kate. Athena decided to approach things more calmly and  drew her sword, resting it on Derian’s abdomen.</p>
<p>“We’ll take those suggestions of  yours into consideration if we have to. I am afraid that very few of  us are what the general population would consider to be moral  citizens. <em>I</em> wouldn’t mind killing you at all.”</p>
<p>“And she’ll do it, too,” Fuuka  warned him. “Athena looks calm on the surface, but if you get her  angry, she’ll explode. There may not be enough of you <em>left</em> to torture after she gets finished!”</p>
<p>“It still doesn’t matter!”  Derian laughed. “I’d rather be frozen in ice for eternity than  face the consequences. Do you really think your torture tactics scare  me? There’s not a single person alive that could get me to betray  my Masters. You’re wasting your time!”</p>
<p>“You’re wrong,” Amy said  firmly. “There is one way we can get what we need, and it isn’t  through torture. We’re just going to ask politely.” Derian stared  at her for a moment, then spat out in uproarious laughter. Amy was  dead serious, though, and turned around to gesture to </p>
<p>someone who had been waiting in the  background. She had anticipated something like this would happen, and  came prepared by bringing a friend who solved problems like this.</p>
<p>“You all know Kyle Ozmund,” she  said cheerily. “His ship won the race today. He’s graciously  decided to donate some of his time to help us out of this mess. Thank  you, Kyle.”</p>
<p>“Hey, cut it out. I may be a  corporate shill but we’re still friends, Ames. I couldn’t turn  you down if the whole universe was coming to an end. So what do you  need me to do?”</p>
<p>“Ask him who he is, why he’s  tried to kill us, and who he works for, please.” Most of the other  women stood dumbfounded as the leader of the Ozmund Company squeezed  through their ranks and approached the wounded Pyrosian. If Lil and  Athena couldn’t scare him, and if he preferred to freeze rather  than confess—a punishment no Pyrosian would willingly choose—what  could this man possibly do? Alala asked this question and Amy quickly  whispered before the process began:</p>
<p>“Well, you may not believe this,  but Kyle’s always been able to get people to tell him the truth.  It’s a kind of…specialty of his. Perhaps that’s how his  business has been so successful.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?!” Amy nodded  and told her to watch. Kyle knelt down until his eyes were level with  Derian’s, and he reached out to grab the red-skinned man by his  horns.</p>
<p>“Tell me your name,” Kyle  commanded in a strong, clear voice. Derian resisted only for one  second before succumbing to the overwhelming urges building up inside  him.</p>
<p>“D…Derian Kazcada!”</p>
<p>“There,” sighed Kyle, “now  that wasn’t so hard, was it? Okay, next question: why are you  trying to kill these women?”</p>
<p>“Several reasons,” Derian  stammered. “Spite, fear, hate, vengeance…their treasures. He told  me to steal their treasures when I had killed them all.”</p>
<p>“Who told you?”</p>
<p>“Master,” he sang eerily.</p>
<p>“Who is that?” Derian paused to  consider it. Master had never revealed his true name.</p>
<p>“Master is…master!”</p>
<p>“Come on, tell us! Don’t hold  anything back!” Lil screamed.</p>
<p>“I swear, I don’t know! Master  never told me anything! I was just small fries to him, honest!”  Kyle sighed and nodded his head.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It’s the truth. I guess this  means we can’t ask who you’re working for.”</p>
<p>“Master was my master,” Derian  squeaked in horror, “but he had <em>another</em> master over him. I  can’t tell you who that is!!”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’ll have to if  we’re to learn anything,” Kyle said. “So who is this higher  master? Are they in charge of everything, or is there someone even  higher?”</p>
<p>“No…they’re the top seed. No  one else is above them.”</p>
<p>“Do you know their name?”</p>
<p>There was an intermission so long  that Kyle wondered if Derian even heard him.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he croaked at last.</p>
<p>“What’s their name?” he asked  gently. Derian began shaking violently, and screamed so loud that  distant passersby craned their heads and started crowding around. The  police blocked as many as they could while Kyle endured the  squalling; he asked three more times, but every time resulted in  louder and louder protest.</p>
<p>“PLEASE, I BEG YOU, DON’T ASK ME  THEIR NAME! I’LL TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE, I SWEAR! <em>ANYTHING!</em> Ahh…don’t make me say it! Don’t make me say it! Don’t make me  say it!! Don’t make me say it!! PLEASE GOD VULCAN, DON’T MAKE ME  SAY IT!! KILL ME NOW!! <em>KILL ME!!</em>”</p>
<p>“Who the hell is this?!” Kyle  demanded. Derian croaked helplessly. He was crying and shaking  uncontrollably. His fists were clenched and his face was twisted. He  couldn’t resist anymore. His voice came out shrill, frail,  terrified, pitiful, and shaken.</p>
<p>“…Origin.”</p>
<p>A roar so loud that it pierced the  sky erupted from the bowels of horror itself, and before Kyle or  anyone else could stop him, Derian shot his hand out, buried his  nails in his neck, and ripped out his own throat. Amidst the ensuing  chaos, his final word hung ominously in the air, a foreboding menace  and a grim foreshadowing of things to come.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next episode</u></em></p>
<p>Naja: So what happened? Did they get  him? Shit, I should’ve been the one to clobber him!</p>
<p>Aseria: Weren’t you the one that  wanted to be in the winner’s circle?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Naja: Oh yeah! And I totally deserve  it, too! It’s too bad we only got third place, but I guess that’s  not too shabby considering how many people were in this race!</p>
<p>Aseria: No, it’s not. You  performed well. Maybe you do deserve this!</p>
<p>Naja: Hell yeah! Hey, wanna have  crazy sex later?</p>
<p>Aseria: Why not RIGHT NOW?!</p>
<p>Lalalalalala, lalalalalala!</p>
<p>Kay: …Um…yeah.</p>
<p>Tee: Heheh, lesbians are so cool.  Join us next time when we conclude the space race story arc and move  on to something else! But what are we moving onto?</p>
<p>Kay: You know, sis, it really  doesn’t matter. “Space Race: aftermath” should wrap everything  up pretty well.</p>
<p>Tee: Heh, I’d like to be “wrapped  up” myself—wink-wink, nudge-nudge!</p>
<p>Kay: …Um, yeah.</p>
