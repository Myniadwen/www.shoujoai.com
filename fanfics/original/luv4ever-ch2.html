<p align="justify"><strong>Elila&rsquo;s   POV</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   looked at the people who came rushing towards us. I saw three female   teachers and a male teacher in the dark. At the back of them were followed   by three male students. One of the students switched on the lights so   they could see us clearly. I looked down at Isabella and I saw her curling   herself up into a ball with a terror look on her face. I saw bruises   on her face where Mark had hit her many times. I felt my heart sank.   I felt that I had failed to protect her, failed to keep her safe from   harm. At the same time, I felt that she fears me now because the way   I acted was not&hellip;human. Like a monster. She looked at Mark and was   shocked to find the condition that he was in now and then looked at   me with fear. I turned away and looked at Mark. He was still unconscious   and most of his tanned skin became the colour of black, blue and purple.   His mouth was swollen with blood still dripping out from his cut lips.   In other words, he was injured in both face and body. I wanted to tell   myself that maybe I was too much on him, but then again I still felt   that he deserved it and may this be a lesson to him so he would NEVER   EVER go near Isabella again. A low growl came out from me when I thought   of that and I blinked in shocked. I was still not so sure why I reacted   this way&hellip;why do I have these unfamiliar yet strong feelings towards   Isabella? I became so confused. I do really need to discuss this with   my parents&hellip;after they know about this little incident that I did&hellip;&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   saw the females teachers went to Isabella&rsquo;s side to comfort her while   the male students went to Mark to check his condition. I stood still   with no emotions or whatsoever on my face as I looked around me. Then,   the male teacher named Mr. Collins came to me and asked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;What   had happened here?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His   face was serious yet curious of what had happened. I tried to speak   but I just shrugged and said.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t   really know what really happened here. Try to ask Isabella when she&rsquo;s   all right because she&rsquo;s the victim here.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"> &nbsp;<strong><em>&lsquo;And   to me too,&rsquo;</em></strong> I though sadly. But Mr. Collins somehow didn&rsquo;t   believe me and said to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t   tell me you don&rsquo;t know what happened young lady! You were here when   it happened! Could you just tell me for god sake?!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   got so annoyed with him and looked at him predatorily and said to him   with full of rage.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;That   bastard tried to rape her! That was what had happened! Satisfied sir?!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My   voice was low yet I growled at him and my eyes started glowing again.   Mr. Collins was shocked and stepped back a bit when he saw my eyes glowed   dangerously at him.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isabella   heard me growled and looked at me straight into my glowing silver eyes.   She was behind Mr. Collins; still seating at the same spot on the floor&hellip;didn&rsquo;t   have any intention to move at all. My glowing eyes started to fade and   I just stared at her, not wanting this to be over somehow. Then, I heard   Mr. Collins asked me with uncertainty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Did&hellip;did&hellip;you   used violence on Mark Harrison?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   didn&rsquo;t answer him straight away so I just took a deep breath. Then   I said to him, still looking at Isabella.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somehow   I knew that very soon, they will know who I am. They may either see   me as a future healer, or their worst nightmare. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">*******************&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An   hour later, Isabella and I were sent to the principal&rsquo;s office. Mrs.   Graham, our principal started to asked Isabella how did the incident   started to happen. Isabella told her that Mark had asked her out many   times before but she always turned him down politely. Then today, she   went to the library to find a book for some research and Mark was there   for he was a school librarian. There were a few students in the library   but somehow she noticed the students started to leave and she found   the library creepily quiet. She happened to be at the back of the library,   searching for a book when suddenly someone grabbed her from behind and   roughly pushed her down on the ground. She started to scream but her   mouth was covered with a rough hand. She then said that she couldn&rsquo;t   see her attacker for it was so dark but then, she heard his voice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Hello   Isabella, now we&rsquo;re alone.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She   knew it was Mark and started to struggle to get free but he was too   strong for her. He then started hitting her on her face, kissing her   neck roughly, calling her nasty names and also started to unbuttoned   her pants. She added saying that was when I came in and started <strong><em> &lsquo;beating&rsquo;</em></strong> Mark up. I looked at Isabella when she said that   and saw her, starting to tremble all over again. I wanted to hold her   protectively in my arms, whisper to her that everything would be all   right but I remembered that we were in the principal&rsquo;s office and   also the fact I knew that Isabella still feared me. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs.   Graham just nodded after she heard Isabella&rsquo;s story and then told   us that a female student who went to the library earlier today was told   by Mark that she and her friends have to leave the library, reasoning   that there was some <strong><em>&lsquo;cleaning up&rsquo;</em></strong> to do. Then later,   a student heard a scream coming from the library when he passed through   and quickly seeks out for a teacher to report what he heard. Then the   rest of the story we all knew what happened after that. She also added   that Mark was sent to the nearest hospital. I just nodded but felt no   sympathy towards Mark and looked at the side of my left eye. I saw Isabella   hugging herself tightly, and she started to tremble madly. Before I   could stop myself, I sent some comfort from my mind to her body to stop   her from trembling any further. She was surprised of the feeling of   comfort in her and started looking around the room, and then looked   at me but I just looked at Mrs. Graham, trying to avoid eye contact   with her. I saw Mrs. Graham taking off her spectacles and went to clean   it with a tissue. She then took out a piece of white A4 paper and a   black pen and handed it to us.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   going to call both of your parents to tell them what had happened today.   Please write down your phone numbers so I could contact them.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   wrote my phone number and handed the paper and the pen to Isabella.   She looked at me and slowly, taking the paper and the pen from me. She   then wrote her phone number and gave the paper back to Mrs. Graham and   placed the pen on top of the desk in front of her. We watched Mrs. Graham   calling Isabella&rsquo;s parent first. The environment in the room was quiet   yet intense, making Isabella and I uncomfortable towards each other.   After ten minutes later, she put the phone down telling Isabella that   her parents were on their way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;And as   for you, Miss Elila Savage&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   looked at Mrs. Graham with a serene face. She looked so serious and   I knew that she was going to find out something about me&hellip;very soon.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Saving   Miss Isabella Brooke from rape, I&rsquo;m glad that you did that. However   Mr. Collins told me that you were the one who used too much violence   on Mr. Mark Harrison&hellip;and also said that you growled at him and you   eyes&hellip;glowed at him which was very unusual&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs.   Graham just trailed off her words and dialled the number to call my   parents. A few minutes later, she put down the phone and Isabella&rsquo;s   parents arrived. They looked so worried when they saw Isabella&rsquo;s bruised   face as Isabella ran to them and hugged them. I just sat on my chair   staring at them and they stared back at me. I bowed my head slightly   and looked elsewhere while Isabella and her parents took their seats   on my left side. As Mrs. Graham filled in the information of the incident,   my parents came in and there was dead silence in the room.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs.   Graham, Isabella and her parents were shocked to see my parents. They   knew who they were. They knew that my father had the <strong><em>&lsquo;power&rsquo;</em></strong> to protect this city (after my grandfather&rsquo;s approval) and he was   a good-skilled protector&hellip;in an animal way. My mother, famous for her   beauty, friendliness and abilities to heal was well-known towards the   citizens of this city. They were powerful and well-known towards all   the citizens, and so are my other relatives too. Mrs. Graham looked   at me with a surprised look and they now knew that I was a blood kin   to the protector&rsquo;s family and also to my father&rsquo;s family that was   called <strong><em>&lsquo;The Savage family&rsquo;</em></strong>. Hey, Savage is a suitable   name for a hunter, don&rsquo;t you think?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,   my mother smiled and shook hands with everyone in the room. My father   was behind my mother and he just bowed to them and waited for my mother   to sit on my right side. Then he sat beside my mother. Isabella&rsquo;s   parents and my parents then discussed with Mrs. Graham while Isabella   and I kept quiet only. Then suddenly, Mrs. Graham turned to me, wanting   to ask a question.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila,   do you have&hellip;powers?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   was quite taken back of the question but just nodded.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Could   you heal someone? I mean, could you heal Isabella? Could you?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   felt like she was trying to test my powers or something. I had used   my powers to heal small cuts or small wounds of mine or little animals   before. I only used little of my powers till the incident that had happened   in the library. I looked at Isabella who sat near the wall. My heart   was telling me to go to her and heal her. I followed my heart and got   out from my chair quietly and walked towards where Isabella was sitting.   She became very alert when I came closer and closer so I stopped a few   centimetres away from her, giving her time to calm down. I felt everybody   staring at me especially my parents who they were trying to observe   how powerful my abilities were becoming. While waiting for Isabella   to calm down, I explored my mother&rsquo;s mind with mine, just wanted to   know how she&rsquo;s feeling now. I could guess that she was surprised when   she heard from Mrs. Graham at how I strike Mark with so much violence   until he was sent to the hospital. My mother used to say to me that   women who became healers in her family, were gentle. If they need to   defend themselves&hellip;they could create illusions or so. So in other words,   I was not like that. I just took a deep breath and looked at Isabella.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   felt my heart softened when I looked at her. My composed face started   to soften a lot. Somehow, I felt love in me for her. I started to caress   her cheek softly as I went nearer to her sitting place and kneeled down   so I could see her face clearly. She reacted to my touch immediately   and her body started to shiver; but I immediately sent comfort and warmness   in me through her body again with my mind. I heard my mother gasped   and quickly told something to my father for he was not a telepathic   like my mother and I. I just ignored my mother and concentrated on Isabella.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   took Isabella&rsquo;s right hand, turning it and boldly kissed her palm   softly. She gasped and stared at my eyes. I looked at her and I felt   so much love in me when I spoke to her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Shh,   my little belle. I won&rsquo;t hurt you. Please trust me enough to allow   me to heal you completely.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   kind of blinked my eyes for a minute, surprised that I called her <strong><em> &lsquo;belle&rsquo;</em></strong>. That was the first time I called her something   else besides Isabella or Isa. Then, I felt Isabella started to relaxed   and I touched her bruises gently. I closed my eyes and concentrated   as I felt a bright white and green glowing light coming out from my   hand as the light did its healing on her bruises. Not long after that,   I opened my eyes and saw my beautiful Isabella again without the bruises   this time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s   done.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   said to her gently with a smile. I heard a gasped of amazement from   everybody and Isabella slowly touches her face, not believing that her   face was healed. When she knew it was true, she cried happily and hugged   me tightly, saying a soft thank you. I hugged her back, overjoyed that   she was happy again. I didn&rsquo;t care that everybody were staring at   us because I wanted to enjoy this moment with bliss.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then,   my smile faded from my lips. I felt it again. The urge to bite her and   it was much stronger than the last time I tend to bite her. <strong><em>&lsquo;Why   the hell do I have this urge? Why now?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought as I cursed   myself softly. Before I could stop myself, I started kissing and licking   her neck erotically, growling at the same time. She was so stunned and   she tried to pull away from me yet I also received a whimper and a moan   from her. I didn&rsquo;t want to let her go so I hold her tightly. I started   nibbling her neck and whimpered softly to myself, begging myself to   stop this madness but somehow it was too strong to control this time.   It&rsquo;s like my body have its own mind, not wanting to obey me and at   the back of my mind kept on saying, <strong><em>&lsquo;Mine! You&rsquo;re mine!&rsquo;</em></strong> I tried to fight the urge but felt myself nearly giving in to the urge.   The need to bite her was unavoidable so I opened my mouth slightly and   settled my teeth on top of her soft skin neck to bite. I then felt fangs   began to grow from my white teeth as the fangs touches her soft neck.   I was just about the bite when I heard my mother&rsquo;s voice in my mind. <strong><em> &lsquo;Elila&hellip;stop!!&rsquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   jerked up to reality. I quickly pulled away from Isabella, saying mentally   to myself what have I done. I saw my mother standing beside Isabella   and my father was behind me, preparing a defence act if I started to   be out of control. Then I saw Mrs. Graham and Isabella&rsquo;s parents,   they looked shocked at my behaviour&hellip;also to see my fangs. My mother   was concerned and my father looked so serious. Isabella had that terror   look on her face again like in the library before. I was ashamed of   myself and looked down on the floor. I was so ashamed the way I acted   inappropriately in front of everyone and to most of all, Isabella. I   acted like an animal or something. I felt like running away yet I just   sat on the floor with shame as my fangs turned back to my normal teeth. <strong><em> &lsquo;Fangs? Where did that come from?&rsquo; God, what the hell happened here?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought mentally when I heard my father started to speak for the first   time since he and my mother first arrived. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;May I   speak to all of you? I will need to ask my daughter to sit outside for   awhile if you allow it Mrs. Graham.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   looked at him curiously. A lot of questions came to my mind. Was he   going to ask Mrs. Graham to get me out of school? Was he going to say   that I have mental problems? What was he going to say? Whatever would   it be? I just shook my head and went out of the room after hearing Mrs.   Graham&rsquo;s approval. I waited outside the room for forty-five minutes   and I saw my parents coming out from the room. They smiled at me and   told me that everything was all right. But I was too confused.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Everything   is all right? How is everything all right when I tried to&hellip;bite Isabella?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe   I said it too loud but everything was like a blur. My parents just smiled   and I saw Isabella, her parents and Mrs. Graham coming out of the room.   Mrs. Graham and Isabella&rsquo;s parents smiled at me yet there was something   that they need to get use to. I could see their expressions, though   they thought they could cover it from me. As for Isabella, she looked   troubled about something. I frowned a little, thinking it must be that   little incident of trying to bite her again. Then I heard my father   talking to me and I looked at him.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;From   now onwards, you will have an important duty to this city.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And   that was when my life started too changed. For two whole months after   that incident, my grandfather trained me to use my abilities and fighting   skills wisely. My father trained me how to use my abilities that he   had too. As my grandfather taught me the ways to fight and to protect,   my father taught me how to shape shift in any forms, using my senses   well and also the ways of a hunter. As for my mother, she trained me   to heal animals and people, also my mind to control things and to communicate   better and longer and lastly, patience. And for two whole hectic months,   I sparred with my male relatives from my mother&rsquo;s and father&rsquo;s family,   determined to be a better equal or a better fighter. And after that,   my grandfather officially gave me the power to be the <strong><em>one</em></strong>.   Not just a healer but also a protector; to protect this city as my other   male relatives. I was also asked to protect the school by Mrs. Graham   till I leave the school one day. I made friends and enemies in the city   and my family, but then again life&rsquo;s like that anyway. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In   present time, I sighed slowly as I felt my heart beating back to normal.   I run my right fingers through my hair as it was blown to my face by   the wind. I begin to relax and look down at the city. Yep, that was   how I became the protector and how I met Isabella. I look at the night   sky sadly. It&rsquo;s been a year that incident had happened. A year that   Mark was expelled from the school. A year I have become a protector   and a year Isabella kept her distance from me. <strong><em>&lsquo;God, I miss   her so much,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought to myself. There was this one time   that I still remembered my conversation with my father that somehow   changed my feelings towards Isabella&hellip;&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A   year ago after the incident, I was training with my father, learning   how to shape shift into a wolf. We then took a break and that was when   he wanted to discuss something with me. He looked so serious and I was   curious of what he was going to say. He sat in front of me and started   asking me questions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila,   when was the first time you had an urge to bite someone in particular?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   looked at him, quite taken back of his question yet I somehow felt that   this must be important. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;When   I was thirteen. But the last &lsquo;incident&rsquo; that I had an urge to bite&hellip;I   felt fangs growing from me. That&rsquo;s the first time.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As   I said that, I absently touched my front teeth slowly&hellip;still thinking   how I could grew fangs at that time. My father however, looked surprised.   I think he was surprised about my age&hellip;not the fangs thing. He then   looked serious again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Was it   someone in particular that you wanted to bite at first?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;No, only   Isabella actually.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   just shrugged when I said that but my father became more and more serious   each time I answered his questions. Patience in me began to lessen more   and more but I just kept quiet. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;So, you   only felt the need to bite Isabella and only her alone?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He   sounded somehow trying to be determined about something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;only   her.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then   he was quiet, thinking. I began to lose my patience and burst out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;What?!   Is there something wrong with me? Why do I want to bite her dad? And   why the fangs? Am I a freak or something?!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My   father was shocked at my outburst. As much as I respect him, I just   couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. He quickly got up from his sitting place   and his strong hands grip my shoulders, wanting me to calm down. I control   my breathing, using some techniques that my mother taught me how to   control my anger. I began to calm down a little but inside me, I needed   to know what was wrong with me&hellip;desperately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t   want to hurt her dad&hellip;I don&rsquo;t want to harm her&hellip;.please...&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Shah&hellip;shhh&hellip;there&rsquo;s   nothing wrong with you, Elila. The bite is&hellip;erm&hellip;part of your animal   side&hellip;my family side actually.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   felt relieved somehow, glad that there was nothing wrong with me. But   I still need to know what the bite was about and why the feeling had   to be so strong till I can&rsquo;t control it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;so   what is this&hellip;bite about actually? And do I grow fangs when I want   to...erm bite? &ldquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   was not that comfortable talking about this with my father. But he&rsquo;s   the only one who knew about this. I looked at him. He was quiet for   awhile, figuring how to say it to me.&nbsp; After a few seconds later,   I had my answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;The bite&hellip;is   a mating bite. Your whole body would react   to someone that you&rsquo;re destined to   &lsquo;mate&rsquo; with forever. The fangs only come out when you start to choose   and first &lsquo;claim&rsquo; your mate. So&hellip;your body reacts to Isabella.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   remembered that night I somehow fainted after I knew the truth about   the bite. I sighed tiredly. I felt my buttocks begin to ache painfully   because of sitting far too long. It takes me sometime to realize that   Isabella put a distance between us because she knew about the mating   bite. My father had told about it to Mrs. Graham, my mother, Isabella   and her parents a year ago. My parents keep on saying to me that they   will always love me even though my future <strong><em>&lsquo;mate&rsquo;</em></strong> would   be a female. My family from both sides knew about it and somehow the   rumour spreads in my school. Now you know why I have enemies in school   and in my family. Especially the males to be exact! But I tried to avoid   any fights that would surely turn into disaster. And, in one year&hellip;I   think back all the memories that I had with Isabella&hellip;and I knew that   I&rsquo;m starting to fall for her&hellip;.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;HELP!!!   AAAAAARRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I   jerked my face up and look down at the city, trying to focus my sense   in hearing. My alertness to protect the victim is strong in my mind.   The scream is far down in the city&hellip;somewhere. The scream is so loud   to my ears that it is so deafening; yet actually it was far away and   a human&rsquo;s hearing could not even hear it. I focus where it comes from.   Then it struck me as my eyes widen in horror. The scream&hellip;the voice   sounds so familiar. <strong><em>&lsquo;No, please don&rsquo;t let it be her,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought as I quickly jump up to the sky. I begin to shape shift and   turn myself into a hawk as I flew down to the location with a blur speed.   As I flew lower and lower, the scream becomes louder and louder to my   ears and I&rsquo;m confident of who is the victim; yet I beg to God, pleading   that she&rsquo;s not the one. And as I nearly arrive to the location, from   afar I see two men and a female victim. But my eyes are focus to the   victim; and there is only one word coming into my mind&hellip;as I flew down   faster and faster; adding with a scream of a hawk.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>&lsquo;Isabella&rsquo;.</em></strong>&nbsp;
