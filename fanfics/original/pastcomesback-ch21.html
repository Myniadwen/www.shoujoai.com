<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>      Krystal, having decided to leave, let out a small scream as her cell phone rang. She 
fumbled with it in her pocket, the ring tone reverberating throughout the empty house. Way 
to not get noticed. &quot;Hello?&quot; She breathed out, frightened.

      &quot;Krystal? Sorry, I was just wondering if you found your sword yet.&quot; The blonde let out 
a sigh of relief, feeling better now. Isaka&#39;s voice was calming her down.

      &quot;No... no I haven&#39;t. I think I might just leave without it and come back tomorrow. If 
anything happens, I&#39;m sure you could save me,&quot; Krystal said, walking.

      &quot;Oh, alright then-&quot; Krystal screamed as Isaka was talking for a mysterious hand 
clamped down on her shoulder. The blonde dropped the phone to the ground, the sound of the 
demon yelling over the phone still apparent. &quot;Krystal? Krystal, are you alright?&quot;

      Her voice was a faint murmur as Krystal laid her eyes on her unknown assailant. 
&quot;Krystal? What are you doing here?&quot; Hoshi asked, trying to smooth out her disheveled hair. 
Krystal felt sick to her stomach, knowing exactly why Hoshi&#39;s hair was messy and her clothes 
hastily put on.

      &quot;I-I just,&quot; Krystal started, fearfully. &quot;I left my sword here-&quot;

      Hoshi leaned down and picked up the phone. Isaka was still shouting over the other 
end. &quot;Did you now?&quot; Her voice had adopted a tone Krystal didn&#39;t quite like.

      &quot;...Hoshi, can I have my phone back?&quot; Hoshi just looked at her and snapped the phone 
shut.

      &quot;Why don&#39;t you wait here? I will go get your sword,&quot; Hoshi said, looking at Krystal. 
The blonde tried to maintain her composure. Hoshi knew that she knew exactly what had been 
going on in her room.

      The silver haired woman walked off presumably to get her sword. Krystal then realized 
that Hoshi still had her cell phone - that wasn&#39;t good. 

***** 

      Isaka was still holding the phone in her hands, even after she&#39;d been hung up on. That 
voice... the voice that was responding to Krystal... and Krystal said... Krystal called her, 
&quot;Hoshi&quot; and-

      The demon let Abby&#39;s home phone drop back into its cradle. If she had heard correctly 
over the phone and Krystal had really been talking to a certain woman, then-

      &quot;We have an emergency!&quot; Isaka shouted suddenly. Seth, who had been in the kitchen with 
Tycara came out.

      &quot;What are you talking about? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; He asked, carrying his little girlfriend.

      Isaka just looked over at Tycara. &quot;I think Hoshi is back.&quot; Tycara&#39;s eyes widened.

      &quot;What?! Hoshi? Isn&#39;t she... but,&quot; Tycara suddenly latched on to Seth. &quot;Wah! Seth, you 
have to keep me safe!&quot;

      The young man was confused, but gave her a comforting hug as Eveon and Mina peeked 
down at the trio from the top of the stairs. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Mina asked, still sleepy.

      &quot;I need you two to go get Tsuru and I will get your mother, Eveon,&quot; Isaka said, 
serious as she went up the stairs. The demon knocked on Abby&#39;s door and opened. Normally, 
she would have been pleased at the sight of two women naked and cuddling, but now wasn&#39;t the 
time.

      &quot;We have a problem,&quot; Isaka stated. Abby scoffed.

      &quot;You know, I think the problem is you. Who comes waltzing in on our special time?&quot; the 
young mother said, disgruntled. Her and Sakura proceeded to get dressed as Isaka headed down 
the hall.

      &quot;Hey you guys,&quot; Eveon said, opening Erin and Faye&#39;s room. &quot;Do you know where Tsuru-&quot;

      The blonde girl stopped speaking, her girlfriend just as shocked. How were they 
supposed to know that Tsuru was in the middle of... of... something... with the two 
goddesses? Faye was the first to notice, giving the girls a sheepish grin. Erin let out a 
small cry of surprise and immediately ceased pleasuring Tsuru. The blue haired girl sat up, 
confused as to why everyone stopped.

      Upon seeing the two girls, Tsuru blushed. Faye said, &quot;Er... we&#39;re just... haha, well 
Eveon, at least now you two get a visual demonstration, right?&quot;

      Isaka came by and went into the room. &quot;Can you guys get dressed? Tsuru, Tsuru I hate 
to interrupt, but Hoshi-&quot;

      Tsuru immediately got up. &quot;Hoshi? You mean that crazy-&quot;

      &quot;Yes, the crazy whore from forever ago,&quot; Isaka said. &quot;I will go get... your, uh, 
outfit and weapons and stuff. You may want to go back under the covers...&quot;

      Tsuru then realized she was naked in front of two teenage girls and her kind of arch 
nemesis. Great.

      &quot;What&#39;s all the fuss about?&quot; Abby asked, peering into the doorway. She immediately 
looked away upon realizing the sight. &quot;Goodness, you guys are ridiculous. You do realize 
that I&#39;m the one who has to watch the sheets and- Eveon, why the hell are you looking?&quot;

      Eveon&#39;s eyes were immediately covered by her mother. &quot;You litte- Gah! Mina is supposed 
to be the pervert here, not you!&quot; Abby complained.

      &quot;But... but! She&#39;s just... naked!&quot; Eveon whined out.

      Seth, being the smart one of the group, settled for sitting at the top of the stairs, 
going nowhere near the threesome that had just been walked in on by the other lesbians of 
the house. It also didn&#39;t help that he overheard Sakura saying, &quot;My... so that&#39;s what Faye 
meant when she said-&quot;

      He let out a slight sigh and the ruckus started to get under control. Tsuru was now 
wearing a robe and walking down the hall fumbling with her cell phone. &quot;I&#39;m going to call 
Bakra - we&#39;re going to need this help if it really is Hoshi.&quot;

      Isaka nodded and went down the stairs, passing by Seth and Tycara. &quot;Right, Seth, you 
try to call Krystal and if you get a hold of her, tell her she needs to get away from Hoshi 
as soon as possible.&quot; The young man nodded and went downstairs as well. The demon 
disappeared in the shadows, presumably going to get Tsuru&#39;s things.

      Tycara looked over at Seth as he dialed Krystal&#39;s cell phone number. &quot;I hope Krystal&#39;s 
alright... Hoshi is a very scary lady,&quot; the hybrid murmured. The phone kept ringing in 
Seth&#39;s ear and he only got Krystal&#39;s voicemail.

      &quot;I don&#39;t know who this Hoshi is, but... why the hell isn&#39;t she answering?&quot;  

***** 

      Krystal wasn&#39;t answering because she no longer had her phone. She really considered 
just running out of the shrine, but... well Hoshi had been screwing her sisters, but that 
didn&#39;t mean... She really just wanted to leave, but how would she get her weapon or her 
phone back? Call up Hoshi later and apologize for running out of her house?

      The young woman debated some more with herself until she heard a groan. It was coming 
from the basement. Krystal&#39;s breath caught in her throat. Hoshi said that it was because 
there had been a flood and there was creaking wood down there, but... but what if it was 
something else?

      She should really just leave the shrine and never come back or at least bring Isaka 
with her next time, but Krystal scurried over to the room with the trapdoor. She pulled it 
up and went downstairs. Heck, if Hoshi found her, Krystal would just have to tell her that 
she was worried about the sounds. It sounded like a groan and a creak. It was coming from 
the door behind the bookcase.

      Krystal was starting to feel like an idiot from a horror movie, but what else could 
she do? She shoved the bookcase to the side and opened the door. The room was small and 
unlit. She jumped as she heard a groan, definitely from a person. There was a shadowy lump 
leaning against the wall opposite of a makeshift bed. The room was like a prison.

      &quot;E...excuse me?&quot; Krystal murmured, heading over to what she presumed to be a person. 
She took off the hood of the cloak they were wearing to reveal silvery blue hair, not unlike 
that of Tsuru&#39;s. The woman was letting out small sounds, her red eyes bleary and clouded. 
She was too pale to be healthy and Krystal soon spied the object of her discomfort.

      There was a collar around her neck, decorated with all kinds of binding symbols, 
obviously used to keep the woman under control. Krystal gulped as the woman leaned against 
her desperately. They really were keeping a monster in their basement.

      &quot;I suppose it was only a matter of time before you found out.&quot;

      Krystal turned around to look at the woman in the doorway. Hoshi was holding her 
staff, giving Krystal a small smile. &quot;Me and my sisters didn&#39;t do such a great job of hiding 
our... well, we just didn&#39;t do a great job.&quot;

      The blonde woman inched away, still holding onto their prisoner as the other two 
sisters laughed. It sounded hollow. Hoshi straightened up, suddenly seeming so sinister. &quot;It 
was really Tsuki&#39;s fault though.&quot; She reached out and pulled her sister close to her. &quot;She 
just couldn&#39;t be quiet and submissive...&quot;

      Tsuki&#39;s eyes were blank and her smile lifeless as Hoshi gave her a sweet kiss on the 
cheek. &quot;Poor little Tsuki. She was so engulfed in your holy presence that the taint that 
kept her so under control began to wear away. You&#39;re such a bad influence on my sisters, 
Krystal. Even Hina started to crumble.&quot;

      &quot;What... what is going on?&quot; Krystal asked, not liking her odds.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry so much, Krystal,&quot; Hina answered. Her voice was still sweet and childish, 
though the purpose behind them was something much darker. &quot;You&#39;re just going to help us 
out.&quot;

      Tsuki nodded. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re going to help us bring back our master.&quot;

      Hoshi started to walk towards her. &quot;It&#39;s quite a shame you found Carmilla. We hoped 
you would have remained ignorant to her presence for a while.&quot;

      &quot;Carmilla?&quot; Krystal said, looking down at the vampire in her arms. Then she was 
Tsuru&#39;s... &quot;Why do you have Carmilla like this and who is your master?&quot;

      The three of them laughed again before Hoshi answered. &quot;I&#39;m sure if Isaka were here, 
she&#39;d love to explain it to you. Instead,&quot; she murmured, stepping closer. &quot;we can teach you 
all about it.&quot;

      Krystal shot up and started casting an art. If she could just clear them out of the 
doorway, she could make a decent run for it... she&#39;d have to leave Carmilla behind, but if 
she came back with help-

      She didn&#39;t even have a chance as Hina&#39;s spirit threads entrapped her and Tsuki recited 
something in a language she didn&#39;t recognize. Krystal was unable to defend herself as she 
was engulfed by a shock of dark energy, courtesy of Tsuki. With a groan, she staggered 
forward into Hoshi&#39;s awaiting arms.

      &quot;My... how pretty you are when you are defenseless,&quot; Hoshi whispered suggestively, 
running a hand through Krystal&#39;s hair. She... she couldn&#39;t move. Tsuki&#39;s attack had left her 
body too weak to struggle. How was she able to use demonic energy? Weren&#39;t they 
exorcists...?

      Hoshi began to carry her away from the room. &quot;Hina, please take Carmilla somewhere 
else. I anticipate we&#39;ll be having guests soon. Tsuki, let&#39;s go make Krystal... comfortable, 
shall we?&quot;

      Krystal blacked out, her last thoughts on Isaka and how the demon didn&#39;t even know 
where the shrine was. 

***** 

      Bakra stood on the doorstep of some house he didn&#39;t even know in the middle of the 
night. Tsuru and him were decent buddies - the last time they&#39;d talked had been last winter. 
So when he got a call in this late at night, he figured it had to be something serious. That 
and Isaka had also been on the line. He hadn&#39;t talked to her... in about four months when 
she was gushing about her new girlfriend that she loved more than her favorite dessert.

      That&#39;s when he knew it had to be SUPER serious, considering that both women were in 
the house, willing to work together for one cause. And that cause, was... well, he could 
have sworn Tsuru said something about Hoshi, though he was still wishing it was false.

      He snapped out of his thoughts when a young girl answered the door, reminding him so 
much of Mara when she was that age... it still made him a bit sad to think of her and Ark. 
The two of them had died forever ago, it seemed like. As a demon, he outlived them both, 
though he tried pretty dang hard to keep an eye on Mara&#39;s descendants.

      &quot;Oh, you must be that Bakra guy,&quot; Eveon said, holding the door open for him. He walked 
in.

      &quot;Yeah, I am. They called about some serious business, so...&quot; His words tapered off as 
he noticed a living room full of women. Wow. This wasn&#39;t awkward at all.

      Isaka stood up. &quot;Thank goodness you&#39;re here, Bakra. I guess we should introduce you to 
everyone before we start explaining what the hell is going on.&quot;

      The demon ruffled his dark hair and started going around in a circle. The girl he met 
at the door was Eveon and Mina was her girlfriend. Eveon had two mothers, an angel and a 
human somehow influenced with some angelic power. Alright... a bit weird. Then he met the 
two goddesses. Double weird. Then he said hello to Tsuru and Isaka, who were somehow not 
going at each other&#39;s throat. Crazy weird. Tycara had been turned into a little girl since 
the last time he saw her and literally had two mothers. Awkward...

      Finally, it was the other man in the room, Seth. &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; he said, shaking 
Bakra&#39;s hand. The demon gave him a smile.

      &quot;No, the pleasure is mine. It&#39;s great to know I&#39;m not the only guy here,&quot; Bakra said, 
shaking Seth&#39;s hand just a little too long. Handsome guy. Tsuru cleared her throat.

      &quot;Yeah, Seth is Tycara&#39;s boyfriend,&quot; the blue haired girl said, giving Bakra a look. 
The demon let out a sigh and resisted the urge to roll his eyes.

      Sure, all the lesbians could hit on straight women and go after taken girls, but if 
the gay demon tries to just admire a good looking boy, it was blasphemy. Talk about a double 
standard...

      &quot;Alright,&quot; Isaka said. &quot;I know you&#39;re all probably wondering what the hell is going 
on, but I think Krystal is currently in the clutches of a very psychotic woman - Hoshi. Not 
only that, but Hoshi has two sisters that are equally off kilter so...&quot; The demon trailed 
off thinking of what to say.

      Bakra sat down next to Seth, not caring about what his friends thought before saying, 
&quot;It&#39;s probably easier just to tell everyone what happened last time. I mean, only me, you, 
Tsuru and Tycara know what happened. Carmilla isn&#39;t here either, so I guess it&#39;s story 
time.&quot;
