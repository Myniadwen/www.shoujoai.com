<h1>Project Angelus (part 29 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>      Eveon looked around their surroundings, unnerved. They&#39;d originally stopped in a 
forest type area, before taking stairs up to a mysterious structure. It was half destroyed, 
but in the night, it had an almost alternate dimension feel to it.

      &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Alice asked.

      &quot;I think she does.&quot;

      Both girls looked to see Adrian standing at the top of another stone staircase that 
led to a different chamber of the ruins. Lilith was standing right next to him, 
scrutinizing Alice. &quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; he said with a smile. &quot;I also appreciate you 
not bringing along your pesky friends, Eveon. Perhaps we can do this civilly.&quot;

      Eveon frowned. &quot;I have no intentions of giving you that power.&quot;

      A smile seemed to appear on Adrian&#39;s lips. &quot;I know. I was thinking we could work 
something out.&quot; He then looked over at the girl accompanying Eveon. &quot;Alice... I can&#39;t 
believe you&#39;re alive.&quot;

      Lilith tensed up immediately. &quot;Th-that&#39;s Alice...?!&quot;

      Adrian nodded. &quot;Miki must have given up her soul... I can feel her presence. 
However,&quot; the blonde man said smoothly. &quot;I doubt she will be any match for the core you 
possess, Lilith.&quot;

      The purple haired woman was hesitant. &quot;I&#39;m sure Eric would be happy to see you,&quot; 
Adrian said off handedly to Alice. &quot;But I left him in another room so he wouldn&#39;t get 
caught up in the fight.&quot;

      &quot;How kind of you,&quot; Alice said, gritting her teeth as the blue green power started to 
envelop her.

      &quot;Don&#39;t kill her,&quot; Adrian told Lilith. &quot;I want her core intact.&quot;

      Lilith nodded, now over her initial surprise and hesitation. &quot;You should have never 
come back, Alice!&quot;

      The green eyed girl paid her words no mind as she charged with her sword right at 
Lilith. As the fight ensued between them, Adrian started talking to Eveon. &quot;I really do 
think we could come to an agreement.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m not into taking over the world, if that&#39;s what you want,&quot; Eveon said bitterly, 
watching the battle. Alice appeared to have the upper hand, her Demon Buster nearly 
smashing Lilith&#39;s energy swords.

      Adrian laughed, running a hand through his hair. &quot;I don&#39;t want to take over the 
world. There is... merely something I wish to find. I need lots of power - power that I 
thought Project Angelus would grant me.&quot;

      Eveon stared at him, confused, so he continued. &quot;Look at how powerful Alice and 
Lilith have become. If I could harness such power, I could accomplish my goals. However... 
getting some of the Creator&#39;s power would be just fine.&quot; He paused as Lilith was smacked 
into a pillar by Alice. &quot;You want to reverse Mina&#39;s Death Doll spell, the fiends want to 
turn others into fiends and I just want a little bit of that power. It can work.&quot;

      The blonde girl bit her lip. &quot;I&#39;d much rather not have you touch that power.&quot;

      Adrian&#39;s smile grew as Lilith was thrown down again. The purple haired woman was 
breathing heavily and barely avoided a slash by Alice. She ran back to Adrian, looking 
distraught. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I... I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m losing...!&quot;

      &quot;Miki&#39;s soul has a strong conviction,&quot; Adrian said, putting an arm around Lilith&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;It must be hard for you to reign in her hybrid powers.&quot;

      She nodded as Alice settled back down near Eveon, glaring at them. Adrian sighed. 
&quot;You&#39;re strong Alice - but that&#39;s alright.&quot; He held Lilith close to him before speaking to 
her. &quot;You&#39;ve done really well, Lilith. I appreciate everything, so you don&#39;t have to fight 
anymore.&quot;

      Lilith didn&#39;t even try to hide the happy blush on her cheeks. &quot;Of... of course! I 
love you, Adrian.&quot;

      &quot;Good,&quot; he stated with a smile. &quot;Thank you for everything - especially for incubating 
Miki&#39;s core for me.&quot;

      The purple haired woman was about to ask him what he meant until she felt his hand on 
her abdomen. Alice tensed up in horror, as did Eveon, when a strange energy began to 
emanate Adrian&#39;s hand. Lilith let out a piercing scream as he lowered his arm to her waist 
to extract the core.

      The core began to float out of her skin into his awaiting palm, the wide eyed Lilith 
too shocked to do anything. Adrian let her go, turning all his attention to the glowing red 
orb, crackling with energy.

      &quot;No!&quot; Alice shouted, running as Adrian threw Lilith&#39;s body down the stairs. She 
caught the older woman just in time for Adrian to lock eyes with Eveon.

      &quot;Why don&#39;t you and I continue this chat?&quot; He turned and ran into the next room as 
Alice shook Lilith.

      &quot;Are you alright?&quot; The purple haired woman stared up blankly in shock.

      &quot;A... Adrian...? I love...you...&quot; Her abdomen was no longer marked with the tattoo 
and was instead a horrifically pale color... Lilith&#39;s eyes were open, but she was looking 
at nothing.

      &quot;That... that jerk!&quot; Eveon exclaimed, running up the stairs.

      &quot;Wait!&quot; Alice called out, trying to get up before going back to Lilith.

      &quot;Alice!&quot; The young girl turned, with much relief to see everyone else coming towards 
her.

      &quot;You idiot!&quot; Isaka yelled. &quot;How could you run off with Eveon?&quot;

      Faye put a hand on Isaka&#39;s shoulder. &quot;They probably would have done it anyway...&quot;

      &quot;Please!&quot; Alice said, interrupting them. &quot;You have to help her!&quot;

      Krystal kneeled down next to her, looking at Lilith. &quot;Her powers... they&#39;re gone...&quot;

      &quot;Adrian extracted her core and threw her away and Eveon ran after him...&quot; Alice 
reported as Krystal started using her holy powers to try and lessen the internal damage 
Adrian caused Lilith.

      &quot;Most of us should go after Eveon-&quot; Josh was cut off as he began to notice the dark 
figures appearing before them.

      Solomon confidently strode down the stairs, his rapier in hand. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that 
can&#39;t happen... at least, not all of you are going to get past me.&quot; His eyes surveyed the 
group. &quot;I&#39;m sure some of you will inevitably.&quot;

      Hoshi frowned as she looked at all the Death Dolls. &quot;The strongest in our group 
should go.&quot;

      Sakura became engulfed in flames as her armor appeared. &quot;Most of us... should stay 
behind,&quot; she said in her raspy voice, looking over at Tycara and Abby.

      Tsuru brandished her swords as Seth came up with the plan. &quot;That means... Sakura and 
Alice should go.&quot;

      Everyone gave him strange looks before Carmilla cut in, understanding his reasoning. 
&quot;Tsuru will be able to take down Solomon, so she needs to stay so Sakura and Alice can go.&quot;

      &quot;M-me?&quot; Alice said, reluctant to leave Lilith.

      &quot;Did you forget?&quot; Bakra asked. &quot;You&#39;re pretty strong with that core of yours.&quot;

      Marx laughed as he played with his hat. &quot;Sakura, keep her safe. I&#39;m going to stay 
here with Dark, but I will follow you soon.&quot;

      As if on cue, the angel gave Alice a good luck hug, which prompted the two goddesses 
to laugh. &quot;Be safe Alice,&quot; Erin said with a small smile.

      &quot;Yeah! You better come back so we can hang out!&quot; Hina added.

      Tsuki giggled. &quot;There&#39;s still so much we want to do.&quot;

      &quot;And you,&quot; Abby said to Sakura. &quot;Don&#39;t do anything silly... I need you back alive.&quot;

      Sakura nodded and turned to Alice. Solomon cleared his throat. &quot;I see you&#39;ve made 
your choices... ready?&quot;

      He was so oddly formal, but the group who could fight circled around Lilith and those 
who couldn&#39;t. Isaka cracked her knuckles. &quot;It kind of sucks we don&#39;t get to fight in the 
final battle...&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head. &quot;Well, maybe if you were stronger...&quot;

      The Death Dolls came at them, but Tsuru immediately lunged at Solomon. He blocked her 
attack with some trouble, watching as Sakura and Alice hurriedly headed past him... He 
wasn&#39;t worried - Adrian would still be there to take care of it. 

***** 

      &quot;Jesus! Is there a war going out there?&quot; Eric asked, looking at Adrian. The blonde 
man continued to walk towards him, the core in his hand.

      Eric paused. &quot;...what happened to Lilith?&quot;

      &quot;I disposed of her,&quot; Adrian said coldly. &quot;Her core is still very good though.&quot;

      &quot;...disposed?&quot; Eric asked, shaking with anger. &quot;Disposed?! What the hell is wrong 
with you? She loved you... Lilith would have done anything for you.&quot;

      &quot;Exactly. And I&#39;ve used that to my advantage,&quot; Adrian held out the core to Eric.

      The scientist was off put. &quot;What are you going to do? Use it?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not for me,&quot; Adrian said with a grin. &quot;You&#39;re very important to me, Eric.&quot;

      Before the professor could retort him and tell him to stop being so homosexual, 
Adrian came towards him and lifted up his shirt. &quot;What the hell-?!&quot;

      Adrian shoved the core up against Eric&#39;s abdomen and watched as it was absorbed. &quot;I 
need you to be alive after all this is over, so think of this as a little protection.&quot;

      Eric tried to find the words to say as he was helpless to stop the core seeping into 
his skin. &quot;B...bastard! We&#39;ve never tested this on males!&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Adrian said, stepping back as the marks began to appear on Eric&#39;s 
stomach. &quot;You wanted the power to destroy me, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

      Eric buckled from the pain, falling over on his side. Adrian leaned down and sifted 
around in Eric&#39;s lab coat and finding a syringe. He took little time to fill it with a 
sedative and inject Eric. &quot;Relax,&quot; Adrian said, as Eric groaned. &quot;Alice is alive, by the 
way. When you wake up, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get to see her.&quot;

      The professor passed out as Adrian continued on. Eveon didn&#39;t even notice him as she 
continued to run to catch up with Adrian. She headed down another hallway, but the ruins 
started to recede and reveal a field. The sky was lit up with a strange energy and she soon 
understood why...

      A massive door was standing at the edge of the cliff and her hand began to glow anew. 
Adrian was leaning confidently against the door, smiling at her. &quot;Ready?&quot; he asked.

      Eveon swallowed. &quot;...I just want to save Mina.&quot;

      Adrian&#39;s smile didn&#39;t disappear. &quot;I won&#39;t stop you.&quot; He stepped away from the door 
slightly. &quot;Go ahead.&quot;

      Eveon took a deep breath, not trusting him completely. She placed her glowing hand, 
now the Key to God, against the door and it began to pulsate. The blonde felt a rush of 
energy as the door started to crack open.

      &quot;Not so fast.&quot;

      The gate was open, but both Eveon and Adrian whirled around to see Pandora standing 
there, Mina right behind her. &quot;I think we need to talk, Adrian,&quot; the fiend said in a sweet 
voice.

      Adrian seemed confused, but he covered it well. &quot;Is something wrong, Pandora? You&#39;re 
going to get the ability you seek very, very soon.&quot;

      The fiend pursed her lips. &quot;I don&#39;t think so. You&#39;re going to make Eveon into the 
vessel for the Creator, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

      He smiled. &quot;I guess you figured out my plan... but what&#39;s the problem?&quot;

      &quot;I can&#39;t make Eveon into a fiend if she becomes God,&quot; Pandora stated simply. &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid you&#39;ll have to use someone else as a vessel.&quot;

      Adrian took a moment to think, surprised. &quot;But... there is no one else more qualified 
than Eveon to do it... Plus, you&#39;ll find other young girls to turn into fiends once this is 
over.&quot;

      Pandora pointed her cane at him. &quot;All I need is a sliver of that power inside that 
door... So I think I&#39;m going to take some of that and turn both these girls into fiends.&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re being ridiculous,&quot; Adrian said with a frown. &quot;Only a human can become the 
Creator, so I can&#39;t allow that. Will you not just gain your ability after Eveon is God? I 
won&#39;t betray you.&quot;

      &quot;Like you did Lilith?&quot; Pandora asked, dark energy gathering around her. &quot;You and I 
both know that I&#39;m more than capable to destroy you.&quot;

      Adrian laughed as he drew his sword, a white, pristine holy blade. &quot;Perhaps if I beat 
you, I&#39;ll still consider granting your wish.&quot;

      Pandora sent a massive amount of dark energy at him, catching Adrian off guard as 
well as Eveon. Adrian barely dissipated it with his sword until he had to block another 
magical attack from Pandora. Eveon took that time to head over to Mina and grab the girl 
close to her.

      &quot;Mina!&quot; She said happily, hugging the girl, even though she was in Death Doll form. 
It didn&#39;t matter to her... Eveon tensed up as she felt Mina hug her back. That was weird... 
She didn&#39;t have time to contemplate it before she turned to see Adrian send off a holy wave 
of destructive energy right her way.

      &quot;No!&quot; Pandora cried out, distraught. The fiend hurriedly stepped in front of them, 
but she had no time to ready her cane or gather dark energy.

      Adrian smiled as his plan worked out perfectly - he never intended to harm Mina or 
Eveon. &quot;Pandora... you love your toys too much...&quot; She took the blow directly and was 
blasted away, bleeding from her side. Eveon watched, shocked that Pandora would protect her 
so readily. The blonde scampered over to the fiend, who was struggling to get up.

      &quot;Pandora... are you alright?&quot; Eveon asked, kneeling down and starting to heal the 
injury.

      &quot;Why are you helping me...?&quot; Pandora asked.

      &quot;You don&#39;t seem like a bad person...&quot; Eveon said, worried about the bleeding

      &quot;You would... both make such nice fiends,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Won&#39;t you and Mina... won&#39;t 
you join me?&quot;

      Eveon smiled. &quot;Maybe we&#39;ll talk about it when you&#39;re better.&quot; She continued to heal 
her wounds tenderly.

      As she was concentrating, Adrian called out to her. &quot;I&#39;ll see you inside,&quot; he said 
with a smile, holding Mina by the arm. The Death Doll was struggling against him, trying to 
shake off his arm as they went through the door.

      Eveon turned back to Pandora, but the girl had passed out... the bleeding was slowing 
and the wound was almost closed. She took a deep breath and continued to use the Key to 
God. Adrian was going to... he was going to use her to become God... the Creator.

      But she had to save Mina. Eveon stood up after Pandora&#39;s wound healed up decently, 
hoping she would be alright. A bright light was coming through the door and she went in 
without hesitation.
