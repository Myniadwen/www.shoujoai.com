Three days, twelve hours, nine minutes and seven&#151;eight&#151;nine&#151;several 
seconds after having sex with Abianne Cerio for the first time, Leena 
Marjanna Katajisto broke up with her.

............

Do you wanna be a poet and write

Do you wanna be an actor up in lights

Do you wanna be a soldier and fight for love

Do you wanna travel the world

Do you wanna be a diver for pearls

Or climb a mountain and touch the clouds above

Be anyone you want to be

Bring to life your fantasies

But I want something in return

I want you to burn burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn

Burn for me

Burn for me

Are you gonna be a gambler and deal

Are you gonna be a doctor and heal

Or go to heaven and touch God&#39;s face

Are you gonna be a dreamer who sleeps

Are you gonna be a sinner who weeps

Or an angel

Under grace

I&#39;ll lay down on your bed of coals

Offer up my heart and soul

But in return

I want you to burn

Burn for me baby

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn burn for me burn for me

Like a candle in my night

Oh burn burn for me burn for me

Yeah

Ah yeah

I want you to burn

I want you to burn for me baby

Ohh yeah

It just wasn&#39;t what she wanted in a relationship. Abi was good-looking, 
flirty, nice and sociable, but she was about as firm as wet sand, and 
putting any kind of relationship or trust on her shoulders would have 
been a bad idea, at least for Leena, who was looking for stability. She 
had gone out with Abi out of politeness and some boredom, and ended up 
having sex with her that one time only because she was too foggy in the 
head and too itchy in the crotch to say otherwise. She didn&#39;t really 
regret it&#151;Abi was attentive and gentle, and it hadn&#39;t been the first 
time for Leena&#151;but it left her hollow and wanting, and sex, she knew, 
should have fulfilled her if given properly.

Poor Abi sulked, but got over it in two days and went after Dr. Andrews, 
who preferred short-term relationships and feminine women anyway. Leena 
had no preference whether they were girlish or mannish, as long as they 
could hold her up, be there when she needed them, endure her follies and 
love her traits. Cerio was nice in bed and good to the eye, but those 
things quickly lost their luster. Leena needed someone with deep inner 
strength, with a powerful yearning for more than sex and skin, somebody 
who could just be, and not fuss over such silly things or worry so much 
or, or... gossip.

Her heart didn&#39;t tell her where she could or should go, so she spent 
many nights alone and many days coaching and training her beloved 
Badgers. The tournament wasn&#39;t until spring, but seasons tended to come 
faster than human reckoning, and time waited for no leisure. Her parents 
would just have to wait for news concerning her next beloved, because 
now she had a job to do.

Some of the soccer team took their shower at home, but most of the girls 
chose the stalls built into the school gym. Since it was a one-gender 
school, bathrooms and locker rooms were a little more open and personal, 
not to mention populous, and only the shiest girl had to hide her figure 
from everyone else. Walking around without clothes, at least in the 
locker room, was more casual and acceptable; the thought of men&#39;s eyes, 
perverse or honorable, was as far away as the nearest co-ed facility, 
some miles down the road.

Zane Klein talked loosely about how her date went. Most of the girls 
agreed that Olivia was indeed very hot, but she was also clumsy, bored, 
slightly bitter, and too serious for her own good, so naturally the date 
went south. The two had not even kissed; they shook elbows instead and 
let that be that. So Klein was open again; their beloved Captain was 
single and looking. Somebody teased her that she and Petra, her longtime 
rival, would be perfect lovers, but only when, as Aintzane put it, &quot;pigs 
fly and Stormtroopers shoot straight&quot;. Ouch.

Blake Baum was not teased but cheered for somehow managing to score two 
gorgeous girlfriends. Having Usha alone was a credit to her name; few 
people realized Krishnan was attracted to girls, even though she led the 
GSA. And Mira van Dijk! What unbelievable fortune had rested on Blake, 
to enable her to charm both van Dijk and Krishnan, two powerful rivals, 
two beautiful and beloved women, and be in the thick as they loved each 
other! She was a huge celebrity; Blake did not like showering with the 
others because of the attention she got, and avoided it whenever 
necessary. Her soccer and track records were barely even recognized.

Jocelyn McKeough was on the team as well, not on a very strong position 
but still an integral part, sort of what Zane had been during her first 
year. Joss liked watching sports more than playing them, but she did 
have some exceptional skill, and could fill in for anybody in a pinch, 
particularly Kathlyn, who had trouble being the goalie due to her lungs. 
The girls gave Joss as much love and support as they could, due to her 
losing her boyfriend and ending up a single mother; she thanked them for 
it.

Jocelyn&#39;s closest friend in Stanton was Erica Fox, who was on the team 
with her older sister, Alisha. The Fox sisters seemed unlikely players, 
due to Erica&#39;s solidarity and Alisha&#39;s punkishness, but having taken 
karate most of their lives, their appearance belied their skill. They, 
along with Jocelyn, made up the &quot;bones&quot; of the team; Alexis Walker, 
Blake Baum, Ivory Tran, and Zane Klein made up the &quot;meat&quot;; Kathlyn the 
&quot;brain&quot;, and Leena the &quot;heart&quot;. Alisha had Nomi Nakatori as a 
girlfriend; Erica was officially unattached, but was interested in Amina 
Washim.

Alexis Walker and Kathlyn Parkin had prematurely crossed over into 
lovers not long ago, and as for Ivory...

Well... what need be said?

But as it had been with Leena, Katt and X did not last long.

As a matter of fact, not long after having sex once&#151;sex &quot;with virginity 
on&quot;, as Parkin put it&#151;they broke off, saying that it had been more of a 
fling than a fire, and poor Katt could probably not keep up with Walker 
anyway. She was happier that way, though.

More than before, her heart turned to Leena.

If an outsider were to examine Kathlyn and hypothesize on what type of 
person she&#39;d want to be with, they would probably guess somebody young, 
shy, somebody she could protect. But in truth, Katt wanted to be the one 
to be protected; she was the shy one, though not young, being almost 
nineteen (she had been held back a year). Ever since reaching puberty, 
maybe longer than that, Kathlyn had yearned for somebody to take her in 
their strong arms, to say just the right words to make her feel better, 
somebody she could lean on and count on. She wanted a rock, she wanted a 
solid anchor; she was the ship set adrift in merciless water.

Hence her crush, now perhaps love, for Leena, and age and profession be 
damned, she declared. How old could she be anyway? Leena looked in her 
mid-twenties, early thirties at the most, and it wasn&#39;t as if Katt was a 
minor, and she wouldn&#39;t be a student long anyway. But Leena would never 
go for her, being a student and all, and such a weakling at that! She 
had ran out of breath before the midway point of the soccer field during 
practice, and sometimes had to carry her inhaler during games. She 
rarely ate, or ate well, and until her senior year, barely went outdoors 
or got exercise at all (of course, because of all the little 
improvements, she was getting stronger).

More so than that, Kathlyn&#39;s personality was, frankly, out of whack. 
Walker had ignored it for the time they were together, since her own 
personality was a few rocks short of a mountain, but a &quot;normal&quot; person 
like Leena would&#39;ve been offended. Katt&#39;s mood swung rapidly, 
uncontrollably; she was worse than Blake Baum, whose ADD was 
embarrassing at worst, cute at best. She got depressed a lot, or else 
offended, and constantly had a complaint, usually one well-justified, 
but sometimes it was just anger lashing out at very general things. She 
did not like very many people, although her kind and polite nature 
stopped her from snapping very often. Parkin had a dark mind; for 
somebody to love her, they would have to be patient and strong and firm 
as a mountain.

Even looking at things from the worst angles, Kathlyn had to admit to 
herself that if anybody had any kind of a prayer, it would be dear 
Leena, who had so far been more of a mentor than a teacher, more of a 
cheerleader than a coach, more of a friend and even big sister than an 
impersonal adult. As these feelings kept going round and round inside 
her already-jumbled head, her petrified heart softened, the burden 
lifted (she could physically feel herself becoming light), and she 
became... not happy, but happier, and certainly not as hopeless about, 
well, hope.

Then again, Leena was her teacher. And when she and Alex broke off (with 
no hard feelings), nobody teased her about her crush, because so few 
people were aware.

............

Poor Abi sulked when Leena broke up with her, but got over it in two 
days and went after Dr. Andrews, who preferred short-term relationships 
and feminine women anyway. She was unsuccessful though, due to the Doc 
going through some negative phase, but there were plenty of women in and 
out of Stanton, and there was one in particular that Abi knew liked her.

Cerio had not met Janna Raulson before her early career as a teacher, 
nor had she heard of the older woman until sometime during the year, 
when somebody had mentioned to her that a lady of particulars had an eye 
out for her. During the moment, Cerio was engaged with another, but it 
broke off for some reason and she had harbored the thought since. She 
came back to it as Leena left her for a solo act, and reasoned that the 
woman who liked her, Ms. Raulson herself, would not be a bad choice in 
love. She was tall and thin, dark-skinned from her Indian heritage (like 
Usha, though the two didn&#39;t know each other well), and was a very sweet, 
helpful, charming lady, albeit strict.

Raulson had not advanced at all towards Abi, whether out of shy nature 
or if she knew the young woman was already taken, or if she really 
hesitated when considering Cerio&#39;s &quot;romantic background&quot;. T&#39;was not age 
that separated them, at least, nor race or profession, and Abi certainly 
seemed to be Janna&#39;s type. She had to wonder, upon those days where she 
walked the halls of Stanton alone, what did keep Janna from making 
advancements. Was she unsure of herself, her sexuality? Did she fear 
rejection? Did she want to take things slow, what? Abi was afire with 
curiosity.

One early morning, well before school began, Janna happened upon Abianne 
sipping at a fountain. Abi noticed Janna by her dress shirt and khaki 
pants with belt, and the way her very long hair swayed as she walked. 
She stood and smiled, a dribble of water still on her mouth. She wanted 
to wait until the right time to remove it.

&quot;Good morning, Jan,&quot; she greeted, merry. Janna returned the smile and 
bowed her head.

&quot;It is, and to you, Abi. Oh, uh, your chin...&quot; Abi knew about the 
trailing drop, but smiled in surprise and let out the mutest of squeaks. 
She shyly grinned and lifted the water up by her finger, sucking on it 
politely before thanking her.

&quot;I&#39;m usually neater,&quot; she admitted. Raulson bowed her head again and 
smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s all right. If you don&#39;t mind my saying, I&#39;ve wondered something. 
You come here early every morning, Abi, and I have to wonder if you like 
it or if it&#39;s just a stop off from some other place.&quot;

&quot;Mm, I work out,&quot; she admitted, standing up straight and whittling out 
her feminine charm. &quot;I wake at five, exercise, shower, eat, and jog most 
of the way here. I&#39;m starting to jog now that the weather&#39;s cooler; 
before, I was melting with sweat at the end of a few miles. Do you work 
out?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; replied Janna bashfully, as she touched her stomach with regret, 
&quot;but I should. I&#39;m getting fat.&quot;

&quot;Oh nonsense, you&#39;re as skinny as I am, and I did some modeling in 
college.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s another thing I must question,&quot; she sang in her faint eastern 
accent. &quot;I&#39;ve always wondered: why work as a math teacher when you could 
model? Isn&#39;t that life more glamorous?&quot;

&quot;As glamorous as an old shoe that&#39;s worn too many times,&quot; she grumbled. 
She lightened a tad and waved her hand, &quot;I got over it, and besides, 
math is my true skill. Beauty fades quickly, but brains are guaranteed 
until senility. And maybe even after that. Besides, what was I doing 
back then but telling normal girls they&#39;d never be loved if they weren&#39;t 
pencils? At least now I&#39;m getting a good message across: smart chicks 
can be hot, too.&quot; Raulson chuckled politely, holding most of her laugh 
behind her hand. For added effect, Abi winked right in the older woman&#39;s 
direction.

&quot;And I don&#39;t just mean you.&quot; That got her attention. Raulson turned red, 
or at least reddish-brown, and grinned as she looked away. Abi gave a 
quaint smile and crossed her arms. Shyness it was, then. She cleared her 
throat and gave her elbow a lucky tap before going out on the limb: 
&quot;So... what? You, me, a date, this Wednesday, if you&#39;re not busy?&quot; Janna 
blushed even more, but at least she was looking at Abi and nodding.

&quot;Yes, I will not have anything on Wednesdays. And come over to my house 
Mondays and Thursdays; a few friends of mine come together and rob me of 
my money. Have I told you I&#39;m not good at gambling?&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; whispered Cerio enticingly, &quot;then I guess strip poker&#39;s out of the 
question.&quot;

.........

&quot;Elly?&quot;

Elspeth Post revived from slumping over her papers and gave Janet Keys a 
warm, if not relieved smile. It was apparent she had been working hard, 
most notably over the few play and musical entries she had received. She 
had most of her job narrowed down to a few, but her mind reeled and 
strained under the pressure. Having her coworker, friend, and former 
teacher present was refreshing, to say the least.

&quot;Janet, come in!&quot; she called. The beloved art teacher came into the 
classroom and sat down next to the younger woman, taking a brief glance 
over the papers.

&quot;Found any yet?&quot;

&quot;Mm, a few. Sarah&#39;s at my heels about musical arrangement. I&#39;m glad she 
volunteered to provide an original score, but if I knew she would be so 
uppity about it, I&#39;d have refused. Would you kindly extend your patience 
for the design and makeup department?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll wait as long as I need to,&quot; she assured her. Elspeth&#39;s shoulders 
lightened even more.

&quot;Good, good. At least one of you is cooperating. And I have Bernie and a 
few others on my side&#151;most teachers seem indifferent, which is rather 
annoying.&quot;

&quot;Mm, but it&#39;s going to be a great play. Quite an adventurous move, 
having the students write it instead of having to pay royalties for 
something somebody&#39;s seen before. How&#39;d you come up with that idea?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I just thought it&#39;d be a good idea, that&#39;s all. We have lots of 
creative students this year, and I&#39;ve received too many requests 
pertaining to this endeavor to ignore it. Besides,&quot; she muttered 
bashfully, &quot;we&#39;re rather low on budget this year. Bernie&#39;s been a saint, 
but she&#39;s stretching herself out too thin. I&#39;m just grateful she 
supports this.&quot; Keys made a satisfied humming sound and placed her hand 
on Post&#39;s shoulder, squeezing it once in support.

&quot;So am I. And don&#39;t be afraid to come to me if you need more help. Oh, 
by the way, did I tell you? My daughter&#39;s having a baby.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Naturally, Elspeth was shocked by the news and reeled from it, 
nearly pushing the art teacher backwards with her exclamation. Janet was 
happy, though, and affirmed the news. Elspeth shook her head violently 
as she tried to comprehend it. &quot;Little Jocelyn, having a baby at her 
age... it&#39;s simply implausible, the situation of the world today!&quot;

&quot;El, they were in love. I&#39;ve seen them together; they were perfect for 
each other.&quot;

&quot;Were?&quot; Elspeth held her breath and looked at Keys; her kind, matronly 
face was sketched by sadness. She took a breath and shook her head up 
and down.

&quot;Yes. Past tense. He&#39;s... with my husband now.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Janet...&quot; Post drew her former teacher into her arms, and Keys 
returned it as naturally as anything. Now that Elspeth had settled into 
her position as drama teacher, after having taken the baton from her 
predecessor, she and Janet became closer than before, so it was not 
uncommon to see them share affection. Janet took a cleansing breath and 
loosened the embrace to smile.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Jocelyn is very strong. She has a good friend, and a mother 
who&#39;ll look out for her.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot; asked Post, blue eyes glowing. 
Janet grinned.

&quot;You could buy me dinner, and keep me company while Joss goes out with 
her friend.&quot; Elspeth smiled humbly and shied away just a bit.

&quot;I was actually planning on doing that anyway,&quot; she confessed softly. 
Janet blinked, and looked at her to see if she really meant... a date. 
The sting of her husband&#39;s death had healed, her grudge against God for 
taking him was gone, and her loneliness had been eased by her foster 
daughter&#39;s arrival. She was still beautiful and still in her prime, 
literally at the top of the age-hill, and although she had never 
considered herself remotely close to being possibly near to a fraction 
of what even the most conservative people would faintly guess to be a 
lesbian, Elspeth was a longtime friend and she needed to get out of the 
house. One date would do her no harm.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said, though nobody had said the difficult D-word out loud, 
&quot;that&#39;s good. I&#39;m looking forward to it. Say, Wednesday night?&quot;

&quot;Wednesday is perfect for me.&quot;

.........

By now, Hitomi had gotten used to seeing Lilian as a student and not as 
a love interest. The awkwardness between them was gone; they were polite 
and warm to each other; they did love each other, though as one person 
would love another and not as romantic interests. Hitomi was already 
perched on her teacher&#39;s chair, reading Cervantes, when Lilian came into 
the room. Gabrielle was following her, trying to convince her to come to 
the pool with her friends so they could swim, tan, and show off to 
everyone else for one last time. Despite being weak against the rays of 
the sun, Lilian was sorely tempted to accept. Hitomi ignored them.

Alexis Walker soon came into the room, looking as if she had just gotten 
out of bed only to fight three people. She crashed on her chair and 
slumped down, making a bang as her head hit the desk. This caught 
Hitomi&#39;s attention; she looked up and stood, then walked over to the 
poor woman and touched her shoulder. Gabrielle and Lilian both expressed 
distant concern.

&quot;You okay, X?&quot; asked the redhead. X groaned and managed to raise her 
head.

&quot;What happened, Miss Walker? Did you hurt yourself? Are you sick?&quot;

&quot;Miss Madsen,&quot; moaned the poor woman, &quot;it&#39;s even worse than that.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; A pause. Walker rolled her eyes.

&quot;I got ditched.&quot;
