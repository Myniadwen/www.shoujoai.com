It was difficult for Odessa not to cry out in rapture; she had to force 
herself to be quiet, or else risk exposure. She was naked, from head to 
toe, a beautiful ochre symbol of womanly fertility, covered only with 
sweat and occasionally the hands of her two partners. Gardenia was 
behind her, slightly more modest in her underwear, squeezing her breasts 
and kissing her back and neck. Robin was in front- or rather below, her 
clothes on but askew from fondling and tussling, on her hands and knees 
with her tongue inside paradise. Odessa long thought she was the 
kinkiest out of them all, but as it turned out, holding their threesome 
in the restricted back room of Parody bookstore was something even she 
blushed at. The thought of getting caught, or even being overheard by 
customers and employees, was just as exciting as the thought that Odessa 
would have these two beauties to herself- eventually.

Her cell phone rang just before she hit orgasm. Damn.

&quot;Oh fuck, who could it be?&quot; she murmured hazily.

&quot;You stay shiny, lover. We&#39;ll play to answer it,&quot; Gardenia said. She and 
Robin stuck their hands out at the same time, one forming &quot;scissors&quot; and 
the other forming &quot;paper&quot;. &quot;Guess it&#39;s my job,&quot; Kemper sighed as she 
broke off to answer the impatient device. Robin resumed cunnilingus but 
it wasn&#39;t the same without her partner in crime.

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Odessa whispered.

&quot;Dunno. Hey, this is Odessa&#39;s phone. Milady&#39;s indisposed and she&#39;s asked 
me to be her answering machine. Leave your name and number at the honk.&quot; 
She squeezed a bicycle horn Robin always kept in the back (don&#39;t ask 
why, you don&#39;t want to know) and picked up pen and paper. &quot;Uh-huh. ...Oh 
wow. So you&#39;re that detective she hired! I remember you! ...Seriously? 
You really think it&#39;s what&#39;s causing the problem? ...Oh shit. No, no, 
it&#39;s no problem. Just, uh...give us a minute, okay? We&#39;re, uh, unloading 
for inventory.&quot;

&quot;Fuck you!&quot; Odessa giggled. &quot;What&#39;s she saying?&quot;

&quot;(She is here NOW!)&quot; she hissed frantically. Robin stumbled and fell, 
and Odessa nearly did the same.

&quot;What?! Here? NOW?&quot;

&quot;(That&#39;s what I said, dumb-ass!) Uhh, no, no, nothing&#39;s wrong. Just 
trying to direct and talk at the same time. ...Yeah, Robin and Odessa 
are here. Um- no, we&#39;re really not ready for you yet...&quot; She gestured 
wildly to her companions and scrambled to assemble her clothes. &quot;Just 
give us a second. ...No, feel free to browse. ...Yeah, we&#39;ll see you in 
a minute! ...Okay, bye!&quot; She hung up and stared desperately at her 
cohorts. &quot;We have two minutes!&quot;

&quot;Fuck!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll discuss that later! Put your clothes on!&quot; Robin blurted.

&quot;Odessa should be the one meeting her!&quot; Gardenia exclaimed as she 
buttoned up. &quot;You&#39;re the one that hired her! Leave us out of it!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s your employee,&quot; Robin pointed.

&quot;It&#39;s your store!&quot; Odessa hissed. Gardenia stumbled into her jeans and 
fell down. Odessa banged into the wall while adjusting her bra and 
knocked something over. Robin tripped over somebody&#39;s sock. They all 
froze as they heard someone knocking at the door.

&quot;You three all right back there? It sounds like you&#39;re reenacting a 
Three Stooges sketch.&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re fine!&quot; Robin called. &quot;We&#39;ll be out in a minute!&quot; She stared 
gloomily at her companions and rubbed her sore bottom. &quot;I told you we 
should have gone to my apartment.&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Discoveries&quot;

 

Agatha Doyle was skimming over a copy of Watchmen when Gardenia, Odessa, 
and Robin slipped out of the back room, still a little disheveled and 
flustered but otherwise presentable. Agatha put the graphic novel down 
and smiled cheerfully.

&quot;Ah, finished? Everything all right?&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure, everything&#39;s fine. Are you finished with your investigation 
already?&quot;

&quot;Already? This was a tougher case than I anticipated. Oh, the hoops I 
had to jump through! But I managed to crack it! The tougher the case, 
the brighter I shine! Now are you sure you&#39;re all right? I heard a lot 
of banging, and your faces are all red and your clothes are messed up.&quot;

&quot;Uhh...&quot; Robin was stuck for a moment but managed to come up with a 
plausible lie. &quot;It&#39;s rough work, you know, and we&#39;re the only ones that- 
&quot; Agatha interrupted her with an understanding smile.

&quot;Just say it&#39;s none of my business and leave it at that.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Uh, it&#39;s none of your business.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to be so rude about it,&quot; she pouted. Her mood swung 
immediately to playful and she grinned, &quot;Just kidding! So where do you 
want to hold this meeting? I&#39;ve got a PowerPoint presentation if you 
have a projector.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s that projector at the Lily Club, but it&#39;s not exactly private,&quot; 
Gardenia pointed.

&quot;I&#39;ve got a projector in my office,&quot; Odessa offered. Agatha clapped her 
hands.

&quot;Wonderful! Since your business won&#39;t open until dark, we&#39;ll have plenty 
of space to ourselves. You lead and I&#39;ll follow.&quot; Robin left control of 
the store to Fausta, who had just gotten back from her game, and 
followed Odessa outside. Out and About was only a few blocks away, so 
they could walk and enjoy the sunny day.

&quot;I&#39;ll also need a large table if you&#39;ve got one- to set up everything I 
collected along the way.&quot;

&quot;My desk should be good enough. Just a second...&quot; Odessa plunged her 
hand into her purse and pulled out an elaborate keychain decorated with 
at least eight novelty items, including a plastic Catwoman, a shark 
tooth, and two &quot;female&quot; symbols interlocked. Once they were inside, the 
quartet took the elevator up to the third floor where Odessa cleaned off 
her desk and Kemper and Granveldt set up the projector. Agatha was busy 
powering one of her laptops up (she had three) and produced a flash 
drive, which she put all of her findings on. The entire setup took the 
better part of five minutes; Detective Doyle invited her clients to take 
a seat and enjoy the presentation.

&quot;It&#39;s too bad I forgot my Sherlock Holmes outfit,&quot; she exclaimed as she 
put a bubble-pipe in her mouth. &quot;This presentation would&#39;ve been a lot 
more effective if I had it- but we all make do. Now: please pay 
attention to the slide show. It&#39;s time you get your money&#39;s worth!&quot;

The trio was in for a treat. Agatha may have been an eccentric, but she 
was also rather brilliant, as many eccentrics are, and she clearly 
enjoyed her work. The woman had a lot of energy and ran around, jabbing 
and gesticulating like a Southern Baptist preacher as her discovery 
blossomed. What she found certainly answered a lot of questions 
concerning Felicity&#39;s behavior, but it also revealed a darker side to 
the girl. Gardenia began to understand why her employee acted the way 
she did, and felt deep sympathy for her.

&quot;First,&quot; Doyle said, blowing a few bubbles, &quot;I must ask that you hold 
all questions for the end of my presentation. I work better when I&#39;m not 
interrupted. My search began by listing all probable causes for Felicity 
Velur&#39;s actions. I eliminated her job, her school, and her team based on 
my observations, so then I turned to her family. Coach Parkin-Katajisto 
was kind enough to reveal- indirectly, of course- a suspicious attitude 
towards Felicity&#39;s father, Samuel, and this is where most of my focus 
was directed. Samuel Velur, a lawyer in his mid-forties, was emotionally 
abused by his father, who deprived Samuel of his one true dream and 
forced a lifestyle upon him that conflicted with his desires. To be 
blunt, the boy loved sports, but was confined to his studies almost all 
his life, until he turned into a jaded shell of his former self. 
Naturally this discipline paid off, but Samuel harbored such a deep 
resentment towards his father that he inadvertently took after him, 
forcing Felicity to abandon all else for the sport he was never able to 
play- namely football, or soccer- thus enabling him to live vicariously 
through his daughter. It&#39;s my professional opinion that most of 
Felicity&#39;s anguish comes from her father&#39;s unreasonable expectations for 
her.

&quot;Naturally, I didn&#39;t just wrap things up there and call it a day. You 
paid me good money and I never like to leave any stone unturned. Since 
Mr. Velur was a lawyer, I managed to skim through a few of his cases, 
and I&#39;ve noticed he&#39;s actually arrested and sued a number of people who, 
in his twisted opinion, tried to inhibit his daughter from realizing her 
potential- mostly harmless soccer moms and dads who encouraged their 
kids more than he wanted them to. I even saw a few former coaches and 
players in the mix- the guy&#39;s wonderfully obsessive. Samuel and his wife 
Katherine have been divorced since Felicity was two, and she&#39;s never 
seen her or even received a letter from her mother since, except for a 
handful of Christmas and birthday cards. I contacted Katherine and 
learned that Samuel put a restraining order on her, forbidding her to 
contact Felicity, although the charges were trumped-up and I could see 
no legal reason to keep it. I also learned that Katherine has made 
multiple attempts to get in touch with her daughter- letters, phone 
calls, just motherly things like that, no harm done- and each attempt 
runs into a dead end, or so Katherine professes. It is therefore my 
opinion that Samuel Velur goes to great lengths to keep the two from 
speaking.

&quot;Now your anger is justified, and I understand how you feel, but you 
have to remember two things. First, Mr. Velur is not evil; he&#39;s simply a 
pathetic small-minded man with a psychotic, single-minded tendency to 
have his daughter live out his dream. He&#39;s oppressive and demanding, but 
he can&#39;t take all the blame. I&#39;d say that at best, two-thirds of 
Felicity&#39;s problems are thanks to his interference. The rest of it, 
besides her own personal lack of confidence and inadequacy, belongs to 
one Melissa Kemp. This part was the most difficult to research, let me 
tell you, but I had a lot of fun.

&quot;I remembered my father telling me that you can always know what makes a 
person happy by what they spend their money on, so I went to Felicity&#39;s 
bank, flashed my badge, and took a peek into her checking account. I 
didn&#39;t see anything out of the ordinary until I noticed that on every 
Monday, Felicity withdraws fifty dollars cash, and has been doing so 
since May of this year. The frequency and precision of these withdrawals 
was a real red light to me. What could she be spending that on, I 
wondered. Why that day, and why that amount? Believe me you, it wasn&#39;t 
easy finding out. I knew I had to look through Felicity&#39;s property to 
find a clue, but luckily, I didn&#39;t have to obtain a search warrant: her 
roommate was quite cooperative once I told her what was going on. Your 
employee is lucky to have friends who care about her like that.

&quot;Even though Miss Beckett was unable to figure out what she was spending 
that money on, I got to the bottom of it! Felicity was putting that 
money in blank envelopes, sealing them, and leaving them at a certain 
location every Monday night. To figure this out, of course, I had to 
tail her, so I&#39;d appreciate it if you didn&#39;t say anything. Poor girl&#39;s 
been through enough. I kept watch over the envelope until I saw someone 
approach it and take it. It was a young woman, early twenties, fairly 
well-off from her outfit, but not too conspicuous. I followed her to her 
residence but didn&#39;t obtain a search warrant. Instead, I ran the address 
through a police database, found a name, then ran that name through. 
Apparently, Miss Kemp was suspected of being a serial blackmailer, but 
nobody could pick up enough solid evidence for an arrest. According to 
the reports, a certain woman matching her description befriends young 
men, or sometimes young women- usually the upper-class- and convinces 
them to engage in public sexual activity. The victim is later contacted 
by an unknown third party who claims to have photos of the encounter, 
and who threatens the victim with exposure unless they pay a weekly 
ransom. The days and amounts differ, but you have to admit it sounds 
suspicious. This is as far as I got. I couldn&#39;t obtain a search warrant 
for Miss Kemp&#39;s house- sorry. Anyway, in my professional opinion, if you 
put severe fatherly pressure, a lack of motherly contact, and a 
blackmailer together, you have the solution to your problem!!&quot;

Agatha took a moment to let this information sink in as she blew bubbles 
from her pipe. She could not have gotten a more stunned reaction if she 
had revealed her audience to be directly related, and she their common 
mother.

&quot;Of course, I&#39;m still not satisfied,&quot; she murmured. &quot;As I said, this is 
only the result of my studies, and the conclusion is largely based on 
opinion and circumstantial evidence. I can&#39;t prove that Samuel Velur is 
living his dream through his daughter, or that he has no good reason to 
keep her from contacting her mother, and the whole blackmail issue rests 
solely on the similarity with the previous unsolved cases. Melissa Kemp 
obviously had alibis for all those times when the photos were taken, and 
she supposedly receives the same ransom letter, so it could all be 
coincidence. Or, it could be that Felicity may very well be suffering 
through some unknown emotional complex that&#39;s beyond my expertise, and 
since I haven&#39;t consoled my psychologist friend, that still remains a 
possibility. But you have to admit there&#39;s room for possibilities 
anywhere. Well, you know her better than I do- perhaps. I haven&#39;t spoken 
with her yet, which I had planned to do if I ran out of options. I don&#39;t 
usually involve the person directly unless I feel it&#39;ll do some good, 
and based on her emotional situation, an interview would be in very bad 
taste. In any case, those are my findings and this is my opinion. It was 
a fun case, and hopefully I&#39;ve done some good. If you ever need me 
again, don&#39;t be shy! Say, can I invite some of my lady friends here 
later?&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure,&quot; Odessa murmured, still reeling from everything she had seen 
and heard. Agatha squealed.

&quot;Perfect! They&#39;ll really get a kick out of it. I mean, I&#39;m not a 
lesbian, but...who knows! Room for possibilities! Ciao!&quot; Agatha&#39;s final 
disposition notwithstanding, the atmosphere in the room had gotten 
incredibly dark and heavy, like an ominous fog had settled. For Odessa 
and Robin, who only knew of Felicity through their common friend, this 
information was surprising, but not necessarily jarring. Gardenia, on 
the other hand, was floored, and sat with her mouth hung open as she ran 
everything through her head. Now her biggest problem was what to do with 
this knowledge, and how to go about breaking it to her employee.

&quot;Wow,&quot; she grunted, removing her glasses and rubbing her eyes. &quot;This is 
some seriously fucked-up shit.&quot;

Meanwhile, our unfortunate heroine was like a sailor whose ship had 
dashed against harsh emotional rocks and was now stranded on a desolate 
wasteland with slim chances for survival. Her father had caught up with 
her before she could leave the soccer field and gave her a piece of his 
mind that almost totally severed the thin cord of sanity that kept her 
from having a nervous breakdown. Also, Monday was pressing down on her, 
and that meant another fifty dollars donated to the mysterious lecher 
who hung over her head like a guillotine. Felicity was a wreck by the 
time she trudged into Lily for her afternoon shift, and not Nadia or 
Gardenia or anything else could lift her spirits. She would have to put 
everything aside, perhaps even homework and health itself, in 
preparation for the final game, merely a week away. And if she failed 
this time...

If she failed, not only would the team be lost, but...

She really planned on going through with it this time. No question about 
it. She would do it. Nothing would be there to stop her; she would see 
it through to the end.

&quot;Why is kittiez being sad?&quot; Nadia called sympathetically. Felicity 
stared at her and almost shattered. She felt like running over to her 
and bawling on her shoulders- then she would let it all out and tell 
her- then she would kiss that beautiful woman and tell her she was madly 
in love- then they would make love- and then everything would be all 
right. She wanted that so badly that it felt like walking through a 
volcano as she stepped away.

&quot;None of your business. Just let me do my job.&quot; She did not hear Nadia&#39;s 
response. Gardenia, however, was a little more proactive, and stepped 
into the kitchen to confront her employee. She was still shaken but now 
filled with righteous determination.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; she insisted. Kemper leaned against the wall.

&quot;Felicity, you know you can talk to me if there&#39;s a problem. For some 
odd reason, even though you keep pushing people away, Nadia and I both 
like you a lot, and it feels frustrating that- &quot;

&quot;Just mind your own damned business.&quot; She accidentally dropped a plate, 
swore under her breath, and marched over to get a broom. Gardenia bent 
down and delicately picked up the bigger pieces; she looked up to see 
tears coming down Felicity&#39;s neck. The older woman threw the shards away 
and finally went for broke, wrapping loving arms around her friend and 
holding her there. That was the last straw: Felicity howled and sobbed 
with a lifetime of anguish behind her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, honey, I&#39;m here. You just do whatever you need to. Sssh. I 
won&#39;t tell anybody.&quot; They stayed in that embrace for quite a long time, 
silent, alone, a rock and a house built on sand, a patient and loving 
friend and her tragic companion, the clay now finally ready to be 
molded.

&quot;Can I stay at your place tonight?&quot; Felicity whispered suddenly.

&quot;Sure, it&#39;s no problem. You want to go now?&quot;

&quot;Is it...okay?&quot; she whimpered. Gardenia nodded and gently kissed her 
cheek.

&quot;Sure. I&#39;ll give you a paid day off. Let&#39;s go this way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered, clutching onto her hand firmly. Gardenia 
left a note for Lau and led Felicity out the back door so that nobody 
could see her pained expression. They got into Gardenia&#39;s car and took 
off, holding their silence for several blocks. Then, the chink in the 
dam finally opened, and Felicity started to speak.

&quot;Uh...I don&#39;t mean to impose...and I&#39;m sorry for...making a scene.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right. I still love ya. Besides, I&#39;ve been meaning to invite 
you over anyway- well, you and everyone else. For a party, I mean. This 
just...uh, gives you the advantage.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she murmured. &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve been evicted or anything, 
and Kasumi hasn&#39;t raised any issues... It&#39;s just...&quot;

&quot;You need a change of scenery,&quot; Gardenia guessed. &quot;I understand. We all 
feel that way. I myself am only home about half the time- the other half 
I&#39;m either at Robin&#39;s or Odessa&#39;s.&quot; Felicity took a deep breath and 
gradually calmed down. She wiped the last of her tears away and took a 
shuddering sigh. The comfort of crying was a better salve than she 
could&#39;ve hoped for; already she was feeling much better.

&quot;My, uh, father really let me have it for screwing up the game 
yesterday,&quot; she said numbly. &quot;He said that if I mess up this next 
one...it&#39;s pretty much over. He&#39;s disowning me and cutting me off from 
my allowance.&quot;

&quot;I watched that game, Felicity. I cheered as loud as I could- me and 
Robin and Odessa. I don&#39;t think Pele himself could&#39;ve done better. Does 
your father always press you with unreasonable expectations?&quot;

&quot;Ever since I was four,&quot; she nodded. Gardenia&#39;s heart caught in her 
throat, and she stared at the road ahead in horror, almost completely 
missing a green light. Four?! So Felicity had been living under these 
conditions for fifteen years?! Either she must&#39;ve been the most 
resilient person on Earth, or else almost completely sucked dry, like a 
raisin left to fester in the sun.

&quot;How do you live with it?&quot; she demanded to know. Felicity gave a 
depressing shrug.

&quot;I guess I just keep delving deeper into soccer and hope that he&#39;s 
pleased.&quot;

&quot;Felicity, you don&#39;t have to put up with that crap!&quot; Gardenia exclaimed. 
&quot;Just tell that bastard off and be done with it! For God&#39;s sake, woman, 
you&#39;re nineteen years old! You don&#39;t live under his roof now! You don&#39;t 
have to obey his rules! Fuck his expectations! Fuck his demands! Do your 
own thing!&quot;

&quot;Do you really think it&#39;s that easy?!&quot; she bellowed. Gardenia was 
alarmed at her outburst, but glad her friend was finally showing some 
emotional behavior. Felicity calmed down quite suddenly and even 
chuckled. &quot;You know how they tame baby elephants at the circus? They tie 
them up next to the biggest, heaviest stake they can find, and no matter 
how much the elephant struggles, it can&#39;t break free. Sooner or later 
she understands that it&#39;s impossible to break out, and gives up. Now 
some last longer than others, sure, but they&#39;re all broken in the end. 
As the elephant grows up, that stake gets smaller and smaller, until 
it&#39;s only a tiny little thing in the ground. People wonder why she 
doesn&#39;t do anything, why she doesn&#39;t try to run. But the elephant 
remembers, and even though she&#39;s at that stage where she could break 
free...she just can&#39;t. It&#39;s the saddest thing in the world.&quot;

Gardenia finally arrived at her house, a quaint condo with a pool out 
back and plenty of room for visitors. She didn&#39;t say a word until both 
she and Felicity stepped out of the car- then, she took her friend by 
the head and stared deep into her eyes with loving conviction.

&quot;You&#39;re not an elephant, Felicity. A jackass, maybe, but not an 
elephant. Get that through your skull. Come inside- I have some things I 
need to tell you.&quot;

Considering that, for almost all of her life, Felicity had been screwed 
over in one way or another, she took everything Gardenia said rather 
well.

&quot;Son of a bitch,&quot; she whispered, looking pale and haggard on the couch. 
Gardenia smiled and touched her forehead with a cold can of beer.

&quot;I know. It&#39;s fucked-up shit, isn&#39;t it? Here, have one: it&#39;ll make you 
feel better.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t drink this!&quot; Felicity exclaimed as she took it. &quot;I&#39;m still 
underage, remember?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re in my house, and as a consenting party, I say it&#39;s all 
right. I&#39;ll be driving you home tomorrow anyway, so what are you worried 
about?&quot; Felicity tried to put her worries aside and popped the top. She 
had never imbibed before- her father damned alcohol as one of society&#39;s 
greatest vices- but today was a day for breaking precedents, and so she 
put it to her lips. &quot;Um, you may want to sip at it first. I&#39;m not sure 
if we have the same tastes, but that&#39;s the only beer I have with me.&quot;

&quot;You could always steal some from work,&quot; Felicity smirked.

&quot;No way!&quot; Gardenia exclaimed, grinning faintly. &quot;That&#39;s for the 
customers; this stuff is for me and my friends. Do you like it?&quot; She 
took a sip and was surprised by how sweet it was. She had known people 
who reeked of nasty-smelling beer and didn&#39;t expect this to be so 
pleasant- so much for trying new things. She took a bigger gulp, but was 
careful to savor it. It was a marvelous way for her to be introduced to 
the sauce, and she would always cherish it, insignificant though it was.

&quot;It&#39;s good,&quot; she answered warmly. She had a peaceful, solemn look on her 
face that Gardenia had never seen before; very few people had. It was 
the look of a person who had abandoned their burdens and now felt light 
enough to fly. It was the look of the traveler who had finally reached 
their destination; the artist after completing their masterpiece; the 
slave after finding their freedom. It was, quite simply, Relief in its 
most absolute form, blessed of all emotions and one of the few where 
abundance is no vice.

&quot;Good. How are you holding up? I hope you&#39;re not mad that we hired a 
private eye to snoop around.&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; she sighed, &quot;but your intentions were good. I was at my 
wit&#39;s end concerning that blackmailer. I can&#39;t be certain that it&#39;s 
actually Melissa doing that, but my woman&#39;s intuition says it is. As for 
why my father doesn&#39;t want me getting in touch with mom...well, I can&#39;t 
really prove that either, but someday I&#39;ll confront him.&quot;

&quot;Anytime soon?&quot; Felicity shook her head.

&quot;Father or no father, I want to focus on this game. But...now that I&#39;ve 
heard all this, I want to stop these destructive habits of mine. I want 
to start playing for me, not for him. I want to break away from the 
stake he&#39;s planted into the ground. I want to be friends with people and 
not...worry about how god-damned good I am at some fucking stupid 
sport!!&quot; The beer might have been more effective than Gardenia had 
planned, or maybe Felicity was just a lightweight and got tipsy after 
one can- or perhaps, more interestingly still, this was her true 
personality come to surface at last. The vulgarity was surprising, but 
not nearly as surprising as Gardenia&#39;s cheer. She never thought that 
hearing someone swear so casually and boldly could have such a positive 
effect on her. Felicity laughed and emptied her can.

&quot;Good stuff!&quot; she exclaimed, her face brightening even more. Well, okay, 
maybe she was just a lightweight. But Gardenia still loved her.

&quot;You look like you&#39;ve had enough!&quot; she giggled. Felicity nodded gaily.

&quot;It&#39;s the mark of discipline to know when to quit. I don&#39;t feel very 
tipsy, but there&#39;s definitely a buzz. Don&#39;t offer me anymore until 
tomorrow, okay?&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Gardenia grinned, finishing her own drink. What an adorable 
person!- and all it took to bring her out was a beer, a shoulder to cry 
on, several startling revelations, and someone to listen. Kemper could 
handle her alcohol a little better than her friend, but her next few 
questions were still motivated by a light-headedness. &quot;So, Melissa Kemp, 
huh? Did you two really...?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Felicity groaned, &quot;we went all the way. She wasn&#39;t even my 
first.&quot;

&quot;Really!!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she beamed. &quot;This girl named Lilly, when I was seventeen, she... 
She was my first. We had been friends for five years and I...oh wow, I 
fell for her like a rock. The happiest day of my life was when we made 
love...but then we got caught, and she got grounded, and they moved 
away... And there aren&#39;t enough beers in the world that could get me to 
tell you what my father did to me!&quot;

&quot;Oh my god...&quot; Gardenia gasped quietly and drew close to hug her; 
Felicity was crying again. They were not tears of desperation, 
thankfully- just tears brought up by bittersweet memories. 
&quot;Um...so...your first time was with...a girl.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she whispered, smiling feebly. &quot;The truth is that I&#39;m a lesbian 
and I have been since...what, sixteen? Fifteen? Maybe even earlier than 
that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; Kemper whispered. &quot;You hide it really well.&quot;

&quot;Right. I&#39;m so deep in the fucking closet, I&#39;m touching asbestos.&quot;

&quot;But you told me just now. Uh, never mind.&quot;

&quot;Does it count?&quot; Felicity asked, smiling thinly. Gardenia nodded 
lovingly and kissed her forehead. Apparently her intervention was all 
that was needed to get the ball rolling. The dam had broken completely 
and now everything it had held back was gushing out smoothly and freely, 
washing the world away. Felicity hugged her but pulled away quickly, 
standing up and taking a deep breath. Gardenia feared she had crossed 
the line, but that was not the case: her guess simply had to use the 
restroom.

&quot;Uh, which way to the bathroom?&quot;

&quot;Down that little hallway, straight on.&quot; Felicity hurried in while 
Gardenia started cleaning up. She put the cans in a recycle bin, 
straightened up the couch, and looked through her cabinets for something 
to eat. She usually just took leftovers from Lily home with her, since 
she wasn&#39;t good at cooking, but now her stores were empty, and so was 
her stomach. There was fruit, vegetables, more beer, and condiments in 
the fridge; there were only frozen dinners and some cheesecake in the 
freezer. Gardenia sighed and wondered if Felicity wouldn&#39;t mind getting 
a pizza. She was flipping through the phone book when her guest emerged 
from the bathroom.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m thinking about ordering a pizza. You in the mood for deep dish 
or thin crust?&quot;

&quot;Um...is there a difference?&quot;

&quot;Well, there&#39;s Old Chicago pizza, which has deep dish, and Donatos, 
which has thin crust. They are equidistant and do not charge for 
delivery.&quot;

&quot;Deep dish,&quot; Felicity said, feeling a little more sober. &quot;Could you also 
get Hawaiian pizza?&quot;

&quot;You mean with pineapples?&quot; Gardenia made a face: she hated pineapples. 
But, she wasn&#39;t the guest of honor, and after everything she had been 
through, Felicity deserved to be spoiled. &quot;Sure,&quot; she sighed, &quot;anything 
you like. But do you mind if we order half-and-half? Pineapples make me 
sick.&quot;

&quot;Four slices is plenty,&quot; Felicity relented.

&quot;Cool, just gimme a sec. Hey, why don&#39;t you look around for a movie you 
want to watch? Oh, that reminds me, I have to call Lau and tell her I 
won&#39;t be able to make it. Just pick whichever one you like!&quot; As Gardenia 
busied herself with two phone calls, Felicity discovered her hostess&#39;s 
collection and browsed through it. It was an unusual combination of pop 
culture (such as science-fiction, spaghetti westerns, anime, and Disney 
films) and lesbian features, both independent and mainstream. It ended 
up being a toss-up between Kurosawa&#39;s Throne of Blood, Bend It Like 
Beckham (her favorite), and Queen&#39;s Coffin, a lesbian erotica by Rio 
Rasmovanok.

&quot;So what&#39;d ya find?&quot; Gardenia said as she peered over Felicity&#39;s 
shoulder. She glanced at them all and smiled. &quot;Hey, you&#39;ve got great 
taste! Toshiro Mifune, Keira Knightley, and lovely Miss Rio! We should 
invite Nadia to watch a few of these! I&#39;ll bet she&#39;s a fan.&quot;

&quot;I might have heard something to that effect,&quot; Felicity answered, 
feeling a pang of regret at the mention of her name. Through her own 
senseless cowardice and inhibitions, she had missed out on one of the 
greatest opportunities ever given to her. But such is life. &quot;So is 
everything all right at the Club?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Lau and Robin have it covered. They&#39;re playing The Goonies and 
Red Dragon, if you were wondering.&quot;

&quot;Both excellent films. And the pizza?&quot;

&quot;Twenty minutes. Feel free to nab anything from the fridge; I&#39;ll get the 
plates. I guess we could watch all three if you want.&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; she said, putting aside her favorite for the two films she had 
never seen. She picked up Queen&#39;s Coffin and felt her stomach flip in 
approval. &quot;Let&#39;s watch this in celebration of my unofficial coming-out.&quot;

&quot;Good choice. It&#39;s pretty sexy.&quot; Gardenia cleared her coffee table, set 
up plates and coasters, and invited Felicity to snuggle in and make 
herself comfortable. Her couch was spacious, warm, and sinfully 
comfortable; you felt like you could sleep on it very naturally. She 
didn&#39;t start the movie yet: they watched cartoons until the pizza came. 
Even though Gardenia was seven years older than Felicity, it turned out 
her tastes were very childish- but there was nothing wrong with that, 
and Felicity was actually envious of her playfulness. The cartoon was 
about halfway over when the pizza came; the two women inhaled its rich 
scent anxiously and placed it on the table.

Soon they settled in together and witnessed a beautiful love story 
unfolding. There were no literal queens in the story, but it did seem 
like one of the main characters was trapped inside a coffin. Rio was 
careful to put male characters in a good light in her films, and several 
even ended up being fairly heroic by the end, but the story ultimately 
revolved around the tormented heroine and her loving companion. 
Felicity&#39;s ears burned and she itched a little in a &quot;compromising area&quot;; 
the love scenes left her panting and breathless. The two heroines could 
have easily passed as lovers in real life; she was surprised to learn 
from her hostess that one of them, a &quot;Rio regular&quot;, was actually 
straight.

It was late and dark outside once the film ended, but nowhere near 
bedtime. Gardenia invited her guest to watch another movie (the pizza 
had long been obliterated), but Felicity had had enough: one more would 
ruin the moment. She asked if she could go swimming; Gardenia said yes; 
she then asked (quite flustered) if she could go skinny dipping; 
Gardenia grinned and insisted.

&quot;Seriously? You don&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;Mind?! Hell, I&#39;ll join you!&quot; Felicity turned bright red and backed off, 
but Gardenia&#39;s intentions were pure. &quot;I won&#39;t do anything funny, Velur, 
I promise. I love you but not in that way.&quot; Gardenia undressed first to 
relax her guest, and gradually slipped in, wincing a little. Even though 
she had assurance, Felicity was still breathing hard as she took her 
shoes, socks, and accessories off. Gardenia grinned at her and turned 
around, even submerging so she would have the most privacy. Once 
Felicity was in, she burst back out and flung water everywhere, an 
unearthly creature radiating with starlit beauty, naked and stunning, as 
unashamed as the original Mother. Naturally Felicity had to put her in 
her place and dunked her several times.

It was finally late enough to sleep when both women quit their playing 
and emerged from the pool, one considerably less shy about herself than 
before. They dressed and dried each other off, chatting quietly and 
intimately. Naturally one of their discussions turned to Felicity&#39;s 
newfound self-expression, and where those energies might be directed.

&quot;So...is there anyone you&#39;re just burning with passion for? And don&#39;t 
tell me you don&#39;t, because I know you steal glances at work when you 
think nobody is watching.&quot;

&quot;You caught me,&quot; she grumbled cheerfully. Felicity smiled softly at her 
new friend and finally confessed with her mouth what she had yearned to 
say for a long time now: &quot;Actually, I was in love with Nadia.&quot;

&quot;Aaah, I knew it!!&quot; she exclaimed joyfully. &quot;So that wasn&#39;t just a 
one-way street! And...okay, I guess I can understand why you never 
jumped her bones, but...well, shoot, it&#39;s almost too late now. She and 
that British girl, uh...Lisa-something...&quot;

&quot;Elisa.&quot;

&quot;Right. Those two are too damn adorable together. You missed out on that 
one.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she sighed, looking melancholy but content at the same time. 
&quot;It&#39;s okay. At least now I can try and be friends with her. Maybe 
someone else will be even better for me.&quot;

&quot;Any ideas?&quot; Felicity smiled, but couldn&#39;t really think of anybody 
special. But that sometimes has its advantages. At least her options 
were wide open now.

&quot;Not yet. But you&#39;ll be the first to know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll hold you to that. Anyway, don&#39;t feel shy about talking to me about 
your problems from now on. I might be your boss on paper but I&#39;d much 
rather be your friend. And feel free to come over anytime you like! 
Speaking of which, about our sleeping arrangements... You want I should 
take the couch?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to force you out of your own bed.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind. You are my guest, after all. Besides, it&#39;s pretty comfy.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we...&quot; Felicity took a breath and revised her thoughts. &quot;Let&#39;s 
take a look at it first. How big is it?&quot;

&quot;What are you getting at?&quot; Gardenia asked, smiling mischievously. The 
bed was sufficiently big enough for both of them, so there seemed no 
issue to discuss: they would share it.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; she whispered. Felicity nodded solemnly.

&quot;I feel like holding somebody.&quot;

&quot;Okay then,&quot; she smiled softly. &quot;I can&#39;t sleep in my jeans or my bra, 
but if it&#39;s a problem...&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s okay.&quot; She smiled giddily- it had been far too long since she 
had cuddled next to someone she loved and trusted- and she never did it 
with anyone whom she shared a purer love towards, where sex was as far 
removed as greed and despair- so it was something to treasure. Felicity 
took her jeans off as well (neither of them wore their bras after 
swimming) and climbed into the bed, digging deep beneath the sheets. 
Gardenia removed her glasses and joined her; she was achingly beautiful 
in the soft nightlight. As they settled in, Felicity reached out and 
brushed against her face, and felt loving lips touch her forehead as she 
was turned around and embraced from behind.

 

The next day, Leena had to rub her eyes to make sure they weren&#39;t 
deceiving her. Felicity had always been one of the best and had 
distinguished herself as an exemplary player, even among the elite, but 
today something was significantly altered. What appeared to be the same 
young woman they had always known turned out to be someone completely 
different; even casual or indifferent observers could tell. Nadia saw 
the change at once and was stunned as her teammate and supposed friend 
arrived at practice, late, humming the opening movement of Beethoven&#39;s 
Sixth Symphony, and smiling, no less. There was a glow about her that 
shined out and told everyone that this was no longer Felicity, but some 
other entity, literally a completely different person with them on the 
field. She still played magnificently but now her skills were sharpened 
by an expression of utmost joy, and she even laughed, even when she made 
a mistake. It was both beautiful and unsettling.

&quot;All right then,&quot; Leena said stiffly as she tried to make some notes. 
&quot;I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on, but it looks like progress to me.&quot;
