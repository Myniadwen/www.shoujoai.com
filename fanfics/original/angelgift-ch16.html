<a href="../original/angelgift-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>        Roma looked out of the shop window curiously. It had been a 
fairly quiet day, some of the others scattered around the bookstore 
reading or talking softly. Quietly she noted, &quot;It appears water is 
coming down from the sky in an frozen form.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s snowing,&quot; Marilyn laughed, running outside. The blue 
haired young woman stretched her arms out and turned, the flakes 
swirling around her body and melting as they touched her cheeks.

        &quot;I&#39;ve never quite understood organic lifeform&#39;s fascination 
with frozen crystals of water,&quot; Roma admitted, watching Marilyn play 
as the snow began to come down harder.

        &quot;And I&#39;m not sure I can explain it,&quot; Kat came up beside her, 
her long brown hair flowing down her back in it&#39;s usual braid.

        Roma&#39;s cheeks reddened, her short red-gold hair falling into 
golden eyes. She hadn&#39;t heard Kat approach, looking over at her to 
ask, &quot;Could you try?&quot;

        Kat chuckled softly. A bit of brown hair had escaped her 
neat braid, falling down into her face as she softly said, &quot;A 
scientist would probably say that it&#39;s just our bodies reaction to 
the sudden cold or something. But personally, I just think we&#39;ve had 
fun out in the snow since we were kids and it gets to be a habit.&quot;

        &quot;I like your explanation better,&quot; Roma said softly.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&quot; Jenna noted from where she was 
sitting by Allison at the desk. Her black hair flowed around her as 
she turned to Allison, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

        Allison pushed her mop of short, sandy brown hair back from 
her face as she asked, &quot;You don&#39;t think that they&#39;re..&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Jenna admitted, &quot;but they sure are cute 
together.&quot;

        Allison had to smile, &quot;Maybe so.&quot; Jenna laid her hand over 
Allison&#39;s, and she gently slipped her fingers into the other woman&#39;s.

        &quot;Hey boss!&quot; Kat called from the front, &quot;It looks like the 
snow&#39;s picking up. Do you want to stay open, or close up early?&quot;

        Allison and Jenna walked out to the front window, looking 
out to where the snow was indeed swirling down much more heavily. 
Marilyn was out there trying to collect enough of the snow to make a 
snowball, a bit of white clinging to her blue hair.

        &quot;The first snow of the year?&quot; Allison chuckled softly. &quot;I 
kind of doubt anyone will be in, honestly,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Then let&#39;s go home,&quot; Jenna smiled, &quot;we can play in the 
snow.&quot;

        Not that far away from them Milly put the phone down and 
reported, &quot;They&#39;re coming home early, because of the snow.&quot;

        &quot;Wimps,&quot; Amara murmured, standing by the window to gaze out 
at the balcony, already covered by a few centimeters of snow.

        Milly gave the black haired bounty hunter a fierce little 
scowl, &quot;And why did you have to move in with us again?&quot;

        &quot;Because Jenna asked me to,&quot; Amara said with a little 
smile, &quot;probably so that she can keep an better eye on me.&quot;

        &quot;Well, yes,&quot; Milly admitted, the redhead&#39;s tail lashing.

        &quot;So are you going to start making up dinner early?&quot; Amara 
asked her loudly, trying to get all of the cat-girl&#39;s attention.

        &quot;I haven&#39;t decided,&quot; Milly admitted thoughtfully, then her 
eyes went very wide. &quot;EEAOW!&quot; she cried out in alarm as something 
both cold and wet was dumped down her back! The girl did a little 
dance trying to get it out, then once she managed it she turned to 
shoot a glare at the woman who had been standing behind her.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Sharin gave Amara a smile, the tall blonde looking 
very pleased with herself.

        &quot;Why.. you..&quot; Milly advanced on Sharin, the hair on her tail 
and cat- ears standing straight up, a fire growing in her green eyes.

        &quot;You&#39;re gonna regret that,&quot; Amara noted.

        Sharin backed away from the clearly furious Milly, &quot;Maybe, 
but it sure was fun.&quot; With that, she turned tail and ran, Milly 
right behind her.

        &quot;I hate wet!&quot; Milly growled as she tried to catch up with 
her,

        The two women bounded out the apartment door out into the 
hallway, then they all but flew down the flight of stairs. Sharin 
opened up the side door outside, running out into nearly a foot of 
fluffy snow covering the ground. She slowed, Sharin realizing that 
she&#39;d lost track of Milly.

        &quot;Now where did she get to...&quot; Sharin murmured to herself 
softly, the blonde warrior looking around her nervously.

        &quot;Banzai!&quot;

        &quot;.. oh,no.&quot; Sharin muttered.

        Pounce! Milly sent both of them crashing to the ground into 
the snow, struggling together as they rolled in the whiteness. &quot;Got 
you,&quot; Milly rolled them again, the cat-girl atop Sharin. &quot;Now who&#39;s 
cold and wet,&quot; she gloated.

        &quot;You&#39;re cute when you&#39;re being evil,&quot; Sharin smirked.

        &quot;What?&quot; Milly blinked.

        Before the cat-girl could even react Sharin lifted herself 
up slightly, gently pressing her lips to the startled maid. While 
the girl was stunned, she grabbed yet another handful of snow and 
dumped it on the back of her neck.

        &quot;Yahhh!&quot; Milly screamed again.

        &quot;Is it me, or is your maid trying to murder Sharin?&quot; Roma 
noted calmly as the group walked up the street towards the building.

        &quot;Looks like it,&quot; Jenna sighed.

        &quot;Should I go try to break them up?&quot; Allison offered 
gallantly.

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Kat shook her head. She had a standing invitation 
to have dinner with them, and today she had decided to take them up 
on it. &quot;Not only does Milly look pissed, but it looks like another 
fighter has entered the fray,&quot; she pointed.

        Pow! Pow! Two snowballs aimed with pinpoint precision sent 
both women falling to the ground. Amara grinned as both women rose 
with murderous looks, bouncing another snowball in her hand, &quot;I just 
couldn&#39;t resist.&quot;

        Sharin and Milly exchanged a long look, instantly deciding 
to make the interloper pay. They charged, Amara bolting away as soon 
as she saw them coming. Still, she wasn&#39;t quite fast enough and both 
women slammed her into the snow.

        &quot;You know, I&#39;m almost tempted to join in,&quot; Allison muttered 
as Amara was forced onto her back, cold snow being rubbed on her 
belly.

        &quot;Bwa-ha ha ha!&quot; Amara wiggled about weakly, &quot;No, stop!&quot;

        Jenna shook her head, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t get in their way.&quot;

        Kat, Roma and Marilyn looked at each other, then all three 
women nodded at the same time. &quot;Let&#39;s get &#39;em,&quot; Kat grinned, and 
they all quickly began to make up snowballs, building up their own 
little piles of snow ammunition.

        &quot;We&#39;d better get clear,&quot; Allison quickly grabbed Jenna by 
the arm, the two laughing as they ran for cover nearby.

        &quot;Incoming,&quot; Amara barely managed to wheeze out just before 
the first salvo of snowballs descended on them all.

        &quot;Ack!&quot; Sharin wiped snow from her face.

        &quot;Ooh, they&#39;re gonna pay for that,&quot; Milly bundled up some 
more snow while she glared over at Kat and the others.

        &quot;Shall we?&quot; Amara dusted herself off, packing snow into a 
tight little ball.

        &quot;Lets,&quot; Sharin agreed, and pretty soon a snowball war was 
begun.

        &quot;You&#39;re surprisingly warm,&quot; Jenna murmured as they sat 
together on the stairs to the front door, Allison&#39;s arm protectively 
around her shoulders.

        &quot;So are you,&quot; Allison pulled her closer. &quot;How long do you 
think it&#39;ll take them to decide to quit?&quot; she asked softly.

        Jenna chuckled, &quot;They&#39;ll get tired eventually.&quot;
