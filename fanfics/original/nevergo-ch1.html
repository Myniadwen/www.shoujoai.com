fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>{It&#146;s weird. After everything we&#146;ve been through together, I still 
feel that same flip-flop thing I felt when I first met her...My 
Tomo-chan. I can&#146;t control it. Nor can I control how I felt about her. 
But if I could, would I have wanted to go back to the way things were? 
No, I couldn&#146;t. I realize that now. I&#146;ll love my Tomo-chan forever and 
ever. I&#146;ll never let you go, Tomo-chan...} 
 
**********
 
Saturday night, in the calm, quiet depths of her bland room, again 
Tomoko Seiyunzuki was planning on going out and she intended on having 
the time of her life. This was all she could pretty much do right now. 
No job, no chance of getting back into school (well at least she 
didn&#146;t want to go back to school), meant that her options were 
limited. It had been hard before, with all of the pressure from her 
dad to do something with her life, but after her mom died...it had 
just become that much harder. Now if Tomoko had no chance in life, not 
mention anyone to hold her heart, she felt she might as well enjoy the 
freedom that having no ties gave her. 

The young nineteen-year-old girl walked over to her body length 
mirror. She took a minute to observe herself. Fairly tall, short, dark 
raven-like hair, crystal blue eyes. The form of her body, as much as 
she told herself it was not true, wasn&#146;t particularly feminine. In a 
sense, in suited her. She knew she wasn&#146;t a dainty, prissy type girl. 
She was athletic and strong, competitive and brash. Even when she was 
a kid, she had a life much more suited to a boy&#146;s. While other girls 
were indoors having tea parties and sleepovers, she was outside 
playing baseball with the guys. Although most had no problems with 
Tomoko, some people always got on her case, calling her a tomboy, or a 
butch girl. This used to drive her crazy, and she even went as far as 
to punch a girl when she got a little too rude. She got a reputation 
after that. Tomoko wasn&#146;t violent by nature, but she did have a 
disturbingly short fuse, and was not prepared to take the kinds of 
abuse that they handed out to her. 

Tomoko looked over herself once again, and blew a kiss to the mirror 
in approval of herself. The raven-haired girl walked over to her chest 
of drawers, grabbed her wallet, and quickly slid it into the back 
pocket of her jeans. As she then began to walk over to the door to 
leave, she took a look at the poster just above her bed. It was a 
poster of one of the most famous young actresses in Japan, Megumi 
Murasaki. 

Tomoko sighed a bit, and blushed faintly as her crystal blue eyes ran 
over the full body poster. Tomoko would never admit it, but she had a 
fierce crush on the young actress, ever since she was about fourteen. 
She saw all of the films that Megumi had been in, twelve in all, while 
none of them were exactly Oscar winning material; she was no slouch in 
the drama business. Aside from her skills as an actor, she was 
devastatingly beautiful, so mature and elegant. Her face; was (in 
Tomoko&#146;s opinion) the very definition of beauty. Megumi had such long, 
silky Aquamarine hair, hauntingly amazing clear diamond eyes, sweet 
cheeks, and full, crimson pouting lips. Megumi&#146;s body was probably the 
most lush, curvaceous and voluptuous body that Tomoko had ever seen. 
(But then again, maybe she was biased; after all, if you feel this 
strongly about someone, you&#146;re going to favour her aren&#146;t you?) 
Megumi&#146;s body, was almost god like, faint creamy skin, long smooth 
legs, petit disposition, her tight and flawless hips, slender waist, 
and...her perfect chest... 

Yes, Megumi Murasaki was gorgeous, and it almost frightened Tomoko, 
that a simple poster could turn her on like this&#133; Tomoko&#146;s attraction 
then turned to a quiet sadness, when she faced the truth. She had no 
chance with this girl. Tomoko wasn&#146;t exactly ashamed of her sexuality, 
but she wasn&#146;t exactly comfortable with it either. She had told no one 
about her inclination towards other girls, although Tomoko got the 
feeling that her best friend Yuri, already knew. And traipsing after a 
movie star with looks that could destroy an army; was not the best way 
to exorcise her orientation. Tomoko then cheered up her she remembered 
that this was supposed to be a fun night out with Yuri. The young 
woman then ran out the door down the stairs in her eagerness, until 
she was stopped by her father, Katsuhito, just metres before she 
reached the door...
 
&#147;Hold it right there young lady.&#148; He said, as her got up of his 
leather recliner, walking towards his only child, about to fly out the 
door without so much as a word.
 
{Dammit!} Tomoko thought, her chance to get out un-noticed, blown to 
tiny little pieces.
&#147;Yeah dad?&#148; Tomoko said, her voice overly sweet.
 
Katsuhito&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;And just where do you think you&#146;re going 
Tomoko? Is there something I should know?&#148;
 
Tomoko exhaled at her dad&#146;s mistrust of her.
 
&#147;I&#146;m going out to a bar with Yuri tonight. Is that okay with you, 
sir?&#148; Tomoko&#146;s rudeness was starting to get on her father&#146;s nerves. It 
wasn&#146;t enough that she almost charged out of here with out saying 
anything, but then she had the nerve to answer back like that?
 
&#147;You wont be going anywhere if you keep talking to me like that 
Tomoko. Understood?&#148; 
 
Katsuhito&#146;s final word &#145;understood&#146; was said with a bit of anger, and 
even though she didn&#146;t show it, she took note.
 
&#147;Yes sir.&#148;
 
&#147;Instead of going out and drinking at bars, you should be doing 
something with you life Tomoko. You have so much going for you, why 
waste it?&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;m not wasting my life dad&#133;I&#146;m just, trying to find myself. I need 
some clarity at the moment&#133; I just need a break to think things 
through.&#148; 
 
&#147;That&#146;s you&#146;re excuse for everything Tomoko. &#145;I&#146;m taking a break&#146;. 
When will you wake up and realize that you&#146;ll have no future if you 
keep on going on like this!&#148;
 
&#147;Why are you being so difficult? I&#146;m just having a night out with 
Yuri. Why is it that every time I talk to you we get into an 
argument?&#148; Tomoko began to yell. Why was father being like this?
 
&#147;I only want what&#146;s best for you Tomoko. You&#146;re all I have left in 
life. I want make sure you do all you can.&#148;
 
&#147;I know that dad. I&#146;ll pull things together, please just...give me 
some time. Can I go now?&#148;
 
Katsuhito sighed.

&#147;You can go.&#148; Katsuhito said, walking back over to his recliner, all 
the while, not looking back his daughter. Tomoko slowly exited the 
door. She got the feeling that her dad wasn&#146;t happy at all.

The raven haired girl walked out into the pavement and waited for 
Yuri. They were supposed to meet at around 10.15, but she wasn&#146;t here 
yet. And although Tomoko was still exited to be going out tonight, her 
little conversation with her dad put a damper on her will to enjoy 
herself. Tomoko squinted as she saw someone approach her, and the 
brunette smiled cheerfully as saw who it was.
 
&#147;Hey Yuri! About time!&#148; Tomoko said as her hugged her best friend.
 
Yuri smiled and grabbed Tomoko by the wrist.
 
&#147;Okay, so I&#146;m a few minutes late, it&#146;s not world war 3 is it? Now lets 
go, you&#146;ll love the place I&#146;m taking you!&#148;
 
&#147;Oh yeah, where are we going?&#148; Tomoko asked as her friend dragged her 
along.
 
&#147;It&#146;s a new club downtown, called the Fallen Angel, and like I said, 
you are going to love it!&#148;
 
********** 
 
On the other side of town, deep in the quiet suburbs of the city, in a 
large mansion, the young actress Megumi Murasaki lay. The actress was 
in one of the many rooms in her house, her bedroom, filled with masses 
of pictures and photos of herself. A gorgeous room, obviously 
belonging to a girl who had everything, but at the same time, had 
nothing. Her face, was matted with tears, as she looked up into the 
mirror, she felt like she saw nothing there, just a phantom...and the 
shame of it made her jerk her head away wildly. She knew if her fans 
saw her like this they would disapprove. Like being a celebrity meant 
that she wasn&#146;t human, or that she didn&#146;t have human desires... 

This crying thing was becoming a regular part of Megumi&#146;s life; in 
front of the people and the cameras she was a star, bright and 
beaming, unaffected by the harsh realities of normal, simple life. In 
private, she was just as fragile as anyone else was. But no one 
realized this, not even her parents Mika and Mamoru Murasaki. She was 
a desperate youth, just like anyone else her age, and she wanted to 
live her life like everyone else. But her &#145;profession&#146; restricted her 
from that world. It was always acting first, life second. She had no 
real friends, if anyone could actually consider themselves to be her 
friend, then it was most probably on a superficial level. Most people 
were too afraid or too intimidated to approach her. Even at school, 
when her career wasn&#146;t as big, Megumi put off people, so when her 
career skyrocketed when she was about sixteen, people then pushed 
themselves away from her even more, probably feeling themselves to be 
&#145;not good enough for her.&#146; Even though the guys give her plenty of 
attention, they were just so shallow and wanted nothing from her but 
the experience of seeing a celebrity, her money, or just (more 
commonly) her body. But it wasn&#146;t just guys she was interested in. Oh 
no, far from it. Megumi had an unmistakable attraction towards women. 
And once again, her work prevented her happiness, as a &#145;girl who likes 
other girls&#146; image would cripple it. And that was how it was for 
Megumi, trapped in a world that offered her everything, but gave her 
nonentity. 

The reality of the situation crushed her. And more sobs were let loose 
from her throat as she lay down on her large, plush bed. As she began 
crying again, Megumi heard a light knock on the door, which startled 
her. 
 
&#147;Megumi? Are you okay?&#148; It was her mother, Miki, and her voice was 
bathed in concern. Megumi became worried, as she thought Miki must of 
heard her crying stomped across her brain.
 
&#147;It&#146;s...okay mom. I&#146;m fine.&#148; Megumi may have been an actress, but she 
would win no awards for that performance. 
 
&#147;Megumi...Sweetie your father and I are worried about you...are you 
sure you&#146;re okay?&#148;
 
The young starlet wiped her eyes with her sleeve as she stood up. Her 
mother wasn&#146;t going to leave until she knew Megumi wasn&#146;t unhappy.
 
&#147;Really mom. I&#146;m fine just a bit tired, that&#146;s all.&#148; This time Megumi 
didn&#146;t sound as half-hearted, and it was enough to convince Miki. 
 
&#147;Alright then. Just tell us if...if you need to talk, wont you 
Sweetie?&#148; Miki asked.
 
&#147;Sure mom. Good night.&#148;
 
&#147;Night Megumi. I love you.&#148; Miki then began to walk away, as Megumi 
could her footsteps pacing across the hall. The young girl sat down on 
her bed again. She felt bad about lying to her mother. But at the same 
time, she didn&#146;t want to worry her either. Megumi lay back across the 
bed, when she saw a magazine that caught her eye. The young actress 
looked at an article about hot new spots in Tokyo. But for some 
reason, one particularly caught her eye...
 
{The Fallen Angel huh? Well I can&#146;t just stay her and sulk, I need to 
get out. I wont live my life in this cage.}       
 
**********
 
Now that I think about it, it *was* probably fate that made me choose 
the Fallen Angel. I just felt so stifled by my career and the 
restrictions that it brought to me, I had to go out and experience 
real life...and that choice led me to Tomo-chan. 
 
**********
 
Just outside the Fallen Angel, Tomoko and Yuri were standing in the 
cool breeze. Tomoko looked the place over. It was much larger then the 
other places they went to, and wasn&#146;t so much of a bar, as it was a 
nightclub. Tomoko seemed doubtful about it though; she didn&#146;t really 
want a loud, and wild night anymore, her father&#146;s anger at her lack of 
direction really got to her, much more than she originally thought it 
did.
 
&#147;I don&#146;t know Yuri, this place seems kinda&#133;&#148; Tomoko trailed off.
 
Yuri looked back at her friend. Ever since she picked Tomoko up, 
Tomoko had seemed miserable. She hid well though, she didn&#146;t actually 
say that she was in a bad mood, but it was obvious if you knew the 
signs.
 
&#147;What&#146;s with you? Normally if we went into a place like this I would 
have to tear your arm off simply to get you out! But today&#133; is there 
something that you&#146;re not telling me?&#148; Yuri walked over Tomoko, and 
wrapped her arm around the taller girl&#146;s shoulder. 
 
&#147;Well, I kinda had an argument with my dad. He says I&#146;m wasting my 
life the way I&#146;m going&#133;&#148; Tomoko&#146;s eyes fell when she remembered it.
 
Yuri scowled. &#147;That guy has always had a stick up his butt. I&#146;m sorry 
Tomoko, but your dad isn&#146;t the nicest guy.&#148;
 
&#147;I know that. But maybe he&#146;s right. Maybe I should do something 
worthwhile. You have college Yuri. I don&#146;t have anything.&#148;
 
&#147;Yeah. I guess I can understand that. But hey, you have plenty of time 
to figure out what to do with your life Tomoko. Just try and enjoy 
yourself tonight.&#148;
 
Tomoko sighed, and smiled at her best friend. 
 
&#147;Yeah!&#148;
 
The two then walked through the double doors of the Fallen Angel, to a 
hall full of music, with people dancing and drinking.
 
********** 
 
Outside the Fallen Angel, in the back entrance, Megumi was standing. 
People were lining up to get in, and Megumi was trapped in the crowds. 
She decided before she left her house (in secret) that she would make 
sure no one would be able to tell whom she was, as that would ruin the 
whole plan. So she wore a scarf and a pair of dark glasses. It wasn&#146;t 
the best of disguises but it served its purpose.  She had to admit she 
was a bit nervous though, even though she didn&#146;t have any real 
friends, she had never gone to a place like this on her own before. 
She knew that these clubs aren&#146;t nearly as dangerous as they were 
presented in films, but she was still worried about whom she might 
come across. 

Megumi walked up and entered the club as the lines filled out. She was 
surprised by the way people were so eager to get in. She heard it was 
popular, but she had never expected it to be this crowded. People were 
drinking, shouting, singing along to the beat of the music, and 
dancing especially. Megumi looked around for a table, but couldn&#146;t 
find anything that wasn&#146;t occupied. However she looked over to the bar 
at the far side of the dance floor, and decided to get a drink. Megumi 
wasn&#146;t a heavy drinker at all, but today wasn&#146;t about following the 
rules she had been pinned down to by her life. The young actress chose 
to walk around the floor, rather than risk being knocked over by one 
of the overly energized people dancing on it. As she reached over 
there, she sat down on a barstool and took a second to look at the 
people who were here. Most of them looked about her age, nineteen, 
although quite a few seemed to be older than that. The girl then 
looked over to a far table to her right, to see four young men, three 
of them just chatting amongst themselves, the other staring at Megumi 
with a surprising interest. He was fairly tall, short brown hair and 
had dark eyes. (From what Megumi could see) He was quite handsome, but 
then again, Megumi could tell that this was the type of guy who 
*really* fancied himself. At first, the Aquamarine haired girl was 
worried that her cover was blown, but then saw that he was more 
interested in her looks, as usually, when someone noticed her, they 
would charge over to her demanding an autograph, or a date. Megumi 
looked away from him, as not to give him ideas, and looked around to 
the bar to see what drinks were there, until a large bartender rubbing 
a glass with a washcloth behind the bar walked over to her. 
 
&#147;What&#146;ll ya&#146; have?&#148; He said to Megumi, still rubbing that glass.
 
&#147;Uh...I&#146;ll...have a glass of wine.&#148; Megumi said quietly.
 
The bartender&#146;s eyes bugged out in his sheer surprise to her order.
 
&#147;Wine?&#148; He repeated in shock. 
 
For some reason Megumi felt very stupid. &#147;Is that...bad?&#148;
 
&#147;I suppose not. It should be surprise enough that a high class lookin&#146; 
chick like you would even come to this place.&#148; 
 
&#147;So what do you recommend?&#148; The young woman asked. 
 
***********
 
On the other side of the dance floor, Tomoko and Yuri were sitting 
around a table, both with drinks handed to them by a waitress. Yuri 
seemed to be very excited, staring at all the men in the room, while 
Tomoko&#146;s mind was far from where she was now. 
 
&#147;Oh yeah! Hey Tomoko, check out that guy over there!&#148; Yuri yanked on 
Tomoko&#146;s arm and motioned her to look towards one of the men at a 
neighbouring table. Tomoko smiled at her friend&#146;s eagerness over a 
guy, but still couldn&#146;t bury what her father said.
 
&#147;Yep, he seems cute Yuri. Why don&#146;t you walk over and introduce 
yourself to him?&#148; Tomoko&#146;s lips curled into a sneaky smile as she 
watched Yuri&#146;s sudden nervousness.
 
&#147;Me&#133;? Go over there&#133;and talk to him? You&#146;re crazy!&#148; 
 
Tomoko&#146;s grin widened. &#147;What&#146;s wrong? Come on you don&#146;t honestly 
believe the system of guy-picks-up-girl still goes on do you? I 
thought you were a free spirit Yuri!&#148; Tomoko couldn&#146;t help it, she 
laughed out loud at her friend&#146;s sudden change of attitude.
 
&#147;Oh ha, ha. Very funny. I wouldn&#146;t even know what to say to him.&#148;
 
&#147;Just say you like him genius, and that you wanna dance with him.&#148;
 
Yuri then weighed her options. &#147;Fine. I&#146;ll do it, but if I make a fool 
out of myself I am never gonna speak to you again!&#148;
 
Tomoko chuckled again. &#147;You&#146;ll be fine, trust me I know.&#148;
 
&#147;Okay I&#146;m going in!&#148; Steely, Yuri stood up and walked over to the 
opposite table. Instantly she started talking to the guy she said she 
liked, still obviously nervous, but hanging in there. After about five 
minutes of talking, the man put a finger to her lips, and whispered 
into her ear. Yuri let out a giddy squeal, as the guy held her hand 
and led her to the dance floor. Yuri then looked back at Tomoko and 
mouthed a quick, &#145;thank you!&#146;. Tomoko waved and returned a quick, 
&#145;You&#146;re welcome&#146;. Tomoko sighed and leaned back on her chair, then 
suddenly felt the need to go to the washroom. 
 
**********
 
Megumi was sitting around at the bar, drinking a glass of white wine. 
Although it wasn&#146;t exactly the best of drinks to have in this kind of 
place, the bartender had some, and gave it to her, trying to hide his 
constant snickers. However Megumi did feel more comfortable now. And 
decided to ease up a bit. And as soon as she let her guard down for a 
while, the guy that was looking at her before came over, and sat next 
to her. Megumi shuffled uncomfortably on the stool, as she felt his 
eyes piercing into her. 
 
&#147;Hey there. You&#146;re new. Haven&#146;t seen you around before.&#148;
 
&#147;...How do you know that?&#148;
 
&#147;I think if anyone as good-looking as you were around normally I would 
notice it.&#148; He smiled again, looking around Megumi. Megumi&#146;s 
discomfort increased. She was sure that she didn&#146;t give out any 
signals that indicated that she had some sort of interest in him. Then 
again, a guy doesn&#146;t really need a signal to make his move.
 
&#147;You&#146;re right. I am new. This is my first time here.&#148; Megumi said, 
looking at the glass, not the guy.
 
&#147;The name&#146;s Kenichi. My friends just call me Ken.&#148;
 
&#147;Nice to meet you, Kenichi. Excuse me, but I just need to go to the 
bathroom.&#148;
 
&#147;Sure.&#148;
 
Megumi stood off the stool and quickly walked away. Her ploy to get 
out of that situation worked but for how long? It would be rude to 
just leave him waiting there, and she didn&#146;t relish the idea of having 
to avoid this guy all night. However, she kept walking.
 
**********
 
Tomoko walked over to the other side of the dance floor, through the 
dancing crowds, when she reached about half way through she realized 
this may not have been the best plan, but keep on walking, eventually 
reaching the other side. The raven-haired woman walked up to the 
bathroom. As soon as she reached the door, she bumped into a young 
woman around her age, wearing a scarf and a pair of dark glasses. The 
girl quickly apologized to Tomoko, and walked into the bathroom 
awkwardly. Even though it was a split second thing, Tomoko took a good 
look at her, and blushed.
 
{Who...who is she...?} Tomoko felt strangely drawn to this girl.
 
The girl was beautiful...and Tomoko couldn&#146;t control her desire. Part 
of her said walk away, you don&#146;t have a chance, and another part of 
her said go after her and try to get to know her. When she thought 
about it in her head it sounded completely ridiculous, and yet Tomoko 
couldn&#146;t help herself. It worked for Yuri right?

Tomoko looked around for anyone, and as she saw that no one was 
coming, she went inside. As she entered, Tomoko&#146;s eyes darted around 
for that girl she had just run into. And she saw her at the back of 
the bathroom. Tomoko looked at the girl...she was so 
beautiful...Tomoko took a step towards the girl, and racked her brain 
to think of something to say to her.

{What am I supposed to say to her? What could she see in me? Wait, no 
just be natural...yeah, natural...I&#146;ll just talk to her...can&#146;t be 
that hard can it?}    
 
&#147;Hey. You seem a little on edge. You all right?&#148; Tomoko said.
 
**********
 
Megumi looked up at the girl who had just walked up towards her, and 
stared blankly at her. Megumi seemed confused about the girl standing 
in front of her. It was the same woman she just bumped into outside 
the door. Why would she care about her welfare? And for some reason, 
Megumi kept staring at her. When the black-haired girl raised an 
eyebrow at her, she jerked her head away and let her hair fall down 
her face in an attempt to hide her embarrassment.
 
&#147;I&#146;m just new here. New to this kind of environment...that&#146;s all&#133;&#148;
 
Even Megumi realized how pitiable that sounded. 
 
&#147;Oh. Well do you really think you need the dark glasses? It&#146;s dark 
enough in here as it is.&#148; Megumi smiled. It was a genuine smile, and 
the first one that crossed her face in a while.
 
&#147;I just thought it might make me stand out less.&#148; 
 
&#147;Well you thought wrong girl. You might look even prettier without 
them.&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s head rose up and she looked at the taller girl. A faint blush 
crept across her face as she did so. However Megumi looked down again, 
towards the sink she was standing in front of. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m not pretty. Not really.&#148;
 
The dark haired girl then walked around the line of sinks and leaned 
in onto the one parallel to Megumi&#146;s. 
 
&#147;Modesty and beauty? That&#146;s a rare combination in women today.&#148; 
 
Megumi smiled again. For some reason her heart started beating faster 
and faster, and if the volume of that music in the background weren&#146;t 
as loud as it was, Megumi was sure the girl across from her would have 
heard it. 
 
&#147;Is that a smile? It suits you.&#148; The dark haired girl said. Megumi&#146;s 
smile became even brighter, and again she let her hair fall in front 
of her face as she felt her pale cheeks burning. Megumi was about to 
say something, when she saw the dark haired girl moving towards the 
door, the level of noise in the bathroom increasing as the door 
opened.
 
&#147;Where are you going?&#148; Megumi instantly regretted saying that after 
she heard the amount of panic in it. The dark haired girl chuckled to 
herself, but she didn&#146;t look back.
 
&#147;I&#146;m gonna get a drink at the bar. Are you coming?&#148; 
 
Megumi smiled a petite smile at this Dark-haired girl. &#147;Yeah.&#148;
 
**********
 
The two walked out of the toilets. Suddenly, Tomoko didn&#146;t feel the 
need to go anymore. And suddenly memories of her argument with her 
father seemed non-existent. Tomoko looked across to the girl beside 
her as they walked to the bar. She seemed less troubled now. She was 
smiling, and Tomoko was filled with a proud wave of elation as she 
figured that it was she who caused it. It was weird. This girl 
reminded her of someone...but whom? It didn&#146;t really matter to her 
though. Tomoko&#146;s attempt at flirting at another women seemed to be 
working. But she didn&#146;t automatically take that as a good sign. The 
girl was looking a little miserable before. Maybe she was just happy 
that someone managed to cheer up&#133; Tomoko then frowned as she saw 
people staring at the Aquamarine haired girl. The dark-haired Tomoko 
looked at her across to her also.
 
{Someone as cute as her must have a boyfriend. Am I just making a fool 
of myself?}  
 
Tomoko&#146;s mood dampened at that thought. She wanted to dismiss it but 
she couldn&#146;t. Was the idea of a gorgeous young woman like her being 
interested in a tomboy like Tomoko really that strange? Before her 
thoughts escaped her, Tomoko and the Aquamarine haired girl reached 
the bar and sat next to each other. Tomoko tried to focus on looking 
cool in front of the girl, but her close proximity put her off. She 
was so close to her, she could smell the sweet traces of her perfume. 
 
{Concentrate Tomoko, concentrate!} She thought to herself.
 
The Aquamarine haired girl squirmed in her seat. She seemed restless 
to Tomoko, and she kept looking around her as if she had expected 
someone.
 
&#147;So...what are we having?&#148; The girl said, her arms rested on the bar 
surface.
 
Tomoko looked over to the bartender. &#147;Two beers please.&#148;
 
The bartender nodded along and walked over to the other side of the 
bar to get the drinks, while the shorter girl stared at Tomoko, this 
time, with surprise and confusion in her eyes. 
 
&#147;A beer?&#148; The girl said doubtfully.
 
&#147;Yes...?&#148; Tomoko said that with a blatant scepticism as to why the 
girl was so confused.
 
The girl looked down to the bar surface, to strike attention away from 
the situation&#133;
 
&#147;Well...it&#146;s just...&#148; The girl seemed embarrassed about it, as she was 
unable to finish her sentence. Tomoko took a better look at her.
 
&#147;You don&#146;t get out much do you?&#148;
 
&#147;Depends on what you mean by, &#145;getting out&#146;. I just never had a beer 
before that&#146;s all.&#148;
 
&#147;Well there&#146;s a first time for everything!&#148; The bartender returned 
with the two beers, and laid them down on the bar surface. Tomoko 
grabbed hers and gulped some of it down. Just as she finished, she 
nodded over to the Aquamarine girl. 
 
&#147;Go on and try it.&#148; 
 
The Aquamarine haired girl was still hesitant, but after seeing Tomoko 
drink it so calmly, she bravely gulped it in the same fashion as 
Tomoko. And nearly spit it up as she got a taste of what it was really 
like.
 
&#147;(Yaugh!) It...it&#146;s so bitter!&#148;
 
Tomoko laughed at the girl&#146;s reaction to the drink. And as the girl 
looked back at Tomoko, she started to laugh to. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry it tasted so bad!&#148; Tomoko said as she laughed. As the mood 
lightened, Tomoko leaned forward and looked towards the aquamarine 
haired girl. 
 
&#147;Why were you so sad before?&#148;
 
The shorter girl seemed startled by her sudden question.
 
&#147;Huh?&#148;
 
Tomoko looked back forwards, away from the girl&#146;s confused face.
 
&#147;Before. You were sad. Why?&#148;
 
The girl stayed quiet for a while, just looking at Tomoko, and 
contemplating on how to answer her question. She sighed, and looked 
back at the bar surface. 
 
&#147;It&#146;s hard to explain...a long story...but when I came here I expected 
things to be different, to have a change of scenery and pace, but 
instead I just feel like a fish out of water.&#148;
 
Tomoko looked back at the girl. Her eyes were more different then 
before. They were distant and consumed, and Tomoko could see things 
about this girl already.
 
&#147;I kinda get where you&#146;re coming from. I wouldn&#146;t expect a girl like 
you to be in a place like this. Figures you would have other reasons 
in coming here.&#148; 
 
&#147;That&#146;s what the bartender said. Do I stand out that much?&#148;
 
&#147;Well in a sense, you do.&#148; Tomoko said calmly.
 
The Aquamarine haired girls face darkened. &#147;I am not special. I do 
have the same needs you do. I&#146;m not some kind of monster that doesn&#146;t 
feel.&#148;
 
Tomoko&#146;s eyes widened at the shorter girl&#146;s statement. The 
raven-haired girl got the feeling she touched a sensitive spot. 
 
&#147;You seem special to me.&#148;
 
The Aquamarine girl&#146;s mild anger changed into embarrassment, and a 
smile crossed her face again, and her former blush returned to her, as 
Tomoko&#146;s words sunk in.
 
The girl then looked towards the bar surface. &#147;Stop it.&#148;
 
Tomoko grinned at her. &#147;You see! There&#146;s that smile I like!&#148;
 
The Aquamarine girl&#146;s smile grew larger, and she looked as if she were 
about to say something, when a guy from a table to the right of the 
two girls walked up to them. Tomoko grew weary of him as he laid his 
eyes upon the Aquamarine haired girl. 
 
{Dammit! Things where going well...why did he have to come along? 
Maybe I should get rid of him&#133; no I don&#146;t have any right to do 
that...I don&#146;t...but I can&#146;t just sit here and let him ruin this&#133;}
 
The man moved next to the Aquamarine haired girl, and looked towards 
her, smiling a sneaky smile at her. She didn&#146;t seem too comfortable 
around him either. 
 
The man piped up. &#147;Hey, how &#145;bout a dance...?&#148;
 
The aquamarine girl looked back at Tomoko, whom had her eyes fixed on 
the guy. She looked back up at him.
 
&#147;Sorry, I don&#146;t think so.&#148; She said simply. The young man still didn&#146;t 
take no for an answer, and asked again.
 
&#147;Come on...why not?&#148; The man then let his hand drift down to hers, and 
the Aquamarine girl squirmed at his touch. 
 
&#147;I just don&#146;t feel like that right now. Will you let go?&#148;
 
The man&#146;s grip on the Aquamarine girl&#146;s hand tightened, and he started 
to lose his patience.
 
&#147;I asked you nicely girl&#133; I said I want a dance, and now you&#146;re...&#148;
 
&#147;Back off!&#148;
 
********** 
 
Megumi and Kenichi looked in the dark haired girl&#146;s direction as she 
yelled out at him. The dark haired girl stood up off the stool and 
walked over to Kenichi. The dark haired girl moved in front of him, 
and Kenichi let go of Megumi&#146;s hand as the tall young woman&#146;s gaze 
drilled into him. Although she was a girl, the dark haired woman was 
around the same height as Kenichi was, and she wasn&#146;t afraid of him 
one little bit&#133; 
 
&#147;I believe she said no to you. That&#146;s it. You&#146;re not going to force 
her into anything she doesn&#146;t want to do. Do you catch my drift?&#148;
 
Kenichi scowled at the girl, but didn&#146;t respond, and slowly walked of 
into crowds around them. Megumi sighed in relief and looked up at the 
dark haired girl.
 
{She&#133; she protected me&#133; why? She doesn&#146;t even know my name&#133;}
 
The dark haired girl looked back at Megumi. A tender, caring and soft 
smile crossed her face; her cheeks already flushed from her anger, and 
gave her hand to the childhood actress.
 
&#147;Come on. Lets go.&#148;
 
Megumi then looked dumbfounded at her. Why was she doing this? 
 
&#147;You...you want to leave, with me?&#148; Megumi stuttered, for the moment 
unaware of her temporary lapse in consistency.
 
&#147;Well I&#146;m not asking that guy to leave with me!&#148; 
 
Megumi looked down at the dark-haired girl&#146;s hand and let out a 
bashful sigh as she clasped it tightly. 
 
&#147;Yes.&#148; Megumi&#146;s eyes sparkled as she held the dark haired girl&#146;s hand, 
and let the woman gently walk with her towards the other side of the 
dance floor. Megumi then stopped as the dark haired girl stopped in 
front of her, and then became worried as the dark haired girl stood 
motionless before her. 
 
&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; If Megumi&#146;s voice became any quieter, she wouldn&#146;t 
have heard it herself. The Dark-haired girl then looked back.
 
&#147;I just have to tell my friend Yuri that I&#146;m leaving. Okay?&#148;
 
Megumi quietly nodded, she didn&#146;t really care what happened as long as 
she got a chance to get to know this girl better. The two then walked 
around the dance floor, and over to a table where a girl and a guy 
were sitting, silently talking to each other. The dark haired girl 
smiled at them, the casual situation they were in seemed to amuse her. 
 
&#147;Hey Yuri, I&#146;m gonna go now okay? I&#146;ll see you tomorrow.&#148;
 
Yuri didn&#146;t look back at her immediately, just looked towards the 
young man she was with, and quickly waved her off.
 
&#147;Yeah sure, sure. Have fun&#133;&#148; Yuri trailed off. The dark haired girl 
exhaled at her friend&#146;s obliviousness. 
 
&#147;Man, same old Yuri!&#148; The dark haired girl looked at Megumi. &#147;Shall we 
go?&#148; Megumi faintly blushed at the dark haired girl, and nodded again. 
Then the two left the Fallen Angel. About an hour later, the two went 
to an all night coffee shop, and had a real chance to talk. After 
speaking to the dark haired girl for quite sometime, she realized how 
late it was getting, it was already about 12.00, and she didn&#146;t expect 
to be talking so long but she liked this girl. She was so confident 
and brave, charming and sweet, and for some reason, she made Megumi so 
very happy with every word she spoke. Megumi really, really liked this 
girl, she was everything she expected a real friend to be, and she had 
only known her for a few hours...she had to see her again.
 
&#147;Wow it&#146;s so great talking to you, but it&#146;s getting late.&#148; The dark 
haired girl said, her head rested in her palms, looking at Megumi. 
 
&#147;I...was wondering...&#148; Megumi glanced back at her, her gaze dropping 
as she began say more.
 
&#147;...I-I&#146;d like to see you again.&#148; 
 
The dark haired girl grinned broadly at Megumi, and the childhood 
actress bashfully laughed at her newest friend&#146;s enthusiasm.
 
&#147;I&#146;d love to see you again too...but...&#148;
 
That &#145;but&#146; was probably the worst but she had ever heard, and it sunk 
into her like dead weight. 
 
&#147;I...understand.&#148; Megumi was prepared to leave, but the Dark-haired 
girl gently held her wrist.
 
&#147;Where are you going?&#148;
 
Megumi couldn&#146;t look back; she knew if she did, the tears would spill 
out and she didn&#146;t want to make herself seem anymore pathetic than she 
already felt. 
 
&#147;You said you didn&#146;t want to see me again.&#148;
 
The dark haired girl&#146;s eyes narrowed.
 
&#147;I never said that. It&#146;s just I don&#146;t know your name...My name is 
Tomoko Seiyunzuki...and you are...&#148;
 
Megumi looked around at Tomoko, and finally put a name to a face, and 
that name was Tomoko... Megumi would have been much more calm, but she 
then just realized that Tomoko was asking for her name. Normally it 
would have been no problem, but knowing her true identity might 
frighten her away. Megumi didn&#146;t want that. This was the first person 
she actually connected with, and Megumi wanted it to stay together. 
Her first inclination was to lie, but she did not want to do that 
either. She had been lucky enough to even find Tomoko, and lying to 
her off the bat was not an option. If she wanted this to go anywhere 
she had to be honest, and if Tomoko wouldn&#146;t accept who she was, 
better Megumi found out now.
 
&#147;Okay. Please try not to be shocked.&#148; Megumi asked.
 
Tomoko raised an eyebrow at Megumi, she didn&#146;t really know what she 
meant by that but followed along. &#147;Sure.&#148;
 
Megumi then exhaled and slowly peeled off the dark glasses and scarf 
that she was wearing and placed them on the table. 
 
&#147;My name is Megumi Murasaki.&#148;
 
**********
 
You know, I don&#146;t think I had ever seen Tomoko as surprised or as 
shocked as she had been when I revealed myself to her. But somehow she 
managed to pick her jaw up off the floor, and let the reality of the 
situation envelop her. Now I can understand Tomo-chan&#146;s difficulty in 
believing that it really was me but still, it was like she was spaced 
out or something...But I could understand it. After that we kept 
seeing each other, all most twice a day, and I couldn&#146;t keep away from 
her. There was just so much I liked about Tomo-chan and so little that 
I didn&#146;t like. She was the only person who I genuinely felt happy with 
back then...I needed her. Anyway we saw much more of each other, and 
for the next three months I could do nothing but be with her. Then at 
around three months and two weeks after we first met, our relationship 
started to change drastically. My Tomoko became my Tomo-chan...
 
**********
 
The shorthaired Tomoko was in her room, on Saturday, and was on top of 
the world. Ever since that day when she first met Megumi, life seemed 
to get better and better. She had gotten back into her father&#146;s good 
books when she got a job. It was in a garage, working on the repairs 
for certain motorcycles. It was a crude, dirty job to do, but Tomoko 
liked to work with her hands and it gave rise to her new lust for 
driving bikes. But more importantly, she had met Megumi, and things 
were great between them. 

At first she found it, strange and impossible to believe that she had 
actually met Megumi Murasaki, the girl that Tomoko had had a crush on 
since she was fourteen, the one and only girl that she had been 
totally besotted with for the past five years. But it was true; she 
was now a friend to Megumi. But part of this she did not like. She 
wanted more from Megumi. She had known that since she first saw her at 
the Fallen Angel. Tomoko actually tried to flirt with her then, but to 
her dismay, Megumi seemed to get the idea that she was just being 
polite. 

Tomoko tried to present her feelings to Megumi numerous times after 
that, but instead of announcing her love for the Aquamarine haired 
actress, it came out as babble or nonsense. Megumi had just come to 
consider this one more of the loveable traits to Tomoko. For some 
reason she had lost the confidence she had on the night she met 
Megumi, but couldn&#146;t come up with a suitable reason for it. The only 
thing that changed was that she knew her identity...

Tomoko then put on her clothes quickly, stood in front of the mirror, 
gave herself a quick look over, and the dark haired girl blew a kiss 
to the mirror in conformation of appearance. She giddily left her room 
and went downstairs, waved goodbye to her father and exited her house. 
Tomoko walked around to back, up to the garage and opened the large 
metal door after un-locking it. Tomoko strode happily and grinned as 
she walked up to her bike, covered with an old withered rainproof 
blanket. Clutching it in tight fists, Tomoko yanked it off and tossed 
it to one side, temporarily taking a moment to observe her bike&#146;s 
clear sheen.
 
&#147;It&#146;s perfect...just like she is.&#148;
 
Tomoko had named her motorcycle Megumi, and after doing so, she kept 
it in really good condition, as if in Tomoko&#146;s eyes, it was actually 
the young actress herself. The dark haired girl quickly mounted her 
bike when she realized that she might be keeping the real Megumi 
waiting, and as soon as she got into a comfortable position, she 
revved up and drove out on to the street.
 
In the quiet depths of her mansion, Megumi was in her room, going over 
herself, checking again and again to make sure she was absolutely 
perfect for Tomoko. Suddenly as she thought about the dark haired 
biker, Megumi&#146;s pale cheeks became a haze of crimson red. The young 
actress then sat down on her bed, remembering Tomoko and all the good 
times they had had together. Since that day, Megumi felt so much 
better. She had finally met someone who wasn&#146;t intimidated by her, and 
actually wanted to be around her. However, there was a problem. 
Megumi&#146;s feelings for Tomoko. Megumi had never told anyone about her 
orientation, not even Tomoko, for fear of scaring her off. In her 
heart Megumi hoped that Tomoko felt the same way, but her mind told 
her that was impossible. That made Megumi feel really bad, and 
although she never actually gave herself away, she was doing a 
terrible job of hiding it. The actress then stood up, and just as 
looked out of the window, that very same young biker drove up to the 
crescent pebble road around Megumi&#146;s mansion&#146;s front lawn. Tomoko 
honked for Megumi and even from this distance, Megumi could catch that 
devilish grin on her face. The aquamarine haired actress ran out the 
door, through two halls and down her pine spiral staircase going 
downstairs, as fast as her small feet could carry her. Megumi then 
zoomed out the door after quickly saying goodbye to her parents Mika 
and Mamoru. The large pine doors then slammed shut behind her as ran 
out, and greeted Tomoko. Megumi stopped running and quietly breathed 
out as she did so. Tomoko smiled at her.
 
{My gosh, she is sooo cute!}  Tomoko thought.
 
Megumi looked up at Tomoko, perched upon her new bike, beaming with 
pride and joy. She instantly felt the need to clutch her heart as she 
looked at Tomoko. Megumi realized that she couldn&#146;t keep this up for 
much longer. She had to know how Tomoko felt about her, and soon.
 
&#147;You ready to go Megumi?&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s cheeks turned a bright red again. &#147;Ready.&#148;
 
Megumi placed both of her hands on Tomoko&#146;s shoulders for support, and 
slowly hoisted her leg up over the bike and adjusted herself to the 
seat of the bike. The Aquamarine haired girl then gently rested her 
head against Tomoko&#146;s back, and let her thin arms wrap themselves 
around the biker&#146;s slender waist. Megumi revelled in the closeness 
between the two off them, and closed her eyes as Tomoko placed her 
hands along the handlebars. The dark haired biker became suddenly 
aware of her very heavy breath and the thundering of her 
heart...Megumi was so close to her now. Why did Megumi have to be so 
affectionate? Tomoko could hear the actress&#146;s peaceful breathing, and 
could smell her alluring scent. This was torture for her. It was 
taking all of her willpower to prevent herself from forcing Megumi 
onto the ground and ravishing her there and then. 
 
&#147;Tomoko...&#148; Megumi sweetly whispered Tomoko&#146;s name, and it made the 
dark haired biker shiver in delight, but also made her anxiety 
increase triple-fold. 
 
The young biker gulped. &#147;Y-yes?&#148;
 
&#147;Can we just drive around for a while? Please?&#148;
 
The young biker smiled. &#147;Of course...Megumi.&#148;
 
The two then drove off into the main road. Back at the mansion, Miki 
was watching the two of them through one of the front windows. She did 
not see that much, but from what she did see, she made some very 
accurate estimations. 
 
Mika looked back towards Mamoru, who was standing behind her, pouring 
himself a glass of brandy from the bottle on the sideboard. 
 
&#147;Mamoru...that girl who Megumi left with...&#148;
 
Mamoru swirled the glass in his hand as he listened to Mika.
 
&#147;Yes? What about her?&#148; He asked.
 
&#147;Do you think she is more than a friend to Megumi?&#148;
 
**********
 
Later that day, Tomoko and Megumi did drive around for a while. Megumi 
just wanted to be close to Tomoko. Nothing else seemed to matter to 
her. As long as she could hold Tomoko in this manner, she would be 
okay, and everything else was merely a distraction. The two eventually 
stopped driving around and reached the inner city. They stopped around 
at an outdoor coffee shop. Tomoko never really liked coffee that much, 
but Megumi did, and recently, the dark haired girl had been going out 
of her way to make Megumi happy. The two sat down on a table outside, 
and began to talk. Then a little later on;
 
&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, you&#146;re so funny Tomoko!&#148; Megumi couldn&#146;t control 
herself around Tomoko, and laughed out loud. 
 
&#147;Well thank you! You know I...hey!&#148; Before Tomoko could finish her 
sentence, she observed something behind Megumi. Megumi also realized 
something else held Tomoko&#146;s attention, and looked back over her 
shoulder.
 
Tomoko smiled happily as she saw Yuri walking up to them.
 
&#147;Hey there Yuri!&#148; Yuri waved back to Tomoko as she neared them. Megumi 
sighed and looked back down at the cup of coffee in her hands. She 
really wanted to be alone with Tomoko, but then... Yuri...it wasn&#146;t 
that she didn&#146;t like her, but Megumi couldn&#146;t help but feel jealous of 
the closeness between her and Tomoko. Yuri would always know Tomoko 
better than Megumi would and she resented that.
 
&#147;Hello guys, whatcha doing?&#148; Yuri asked.
 
&#147;Just hanging around, not much.&#148; 
 
Tomoko was about to say something in addition to that, but before she 
could, she heard her cell phone ring. Megumi and Yuri both looked at 
Tomoko as she held the phone to her ear, and answered.
 
&#147;Hello? Oh right. Huh...right now? Why? You gave me the day off...when 
do they need it by? That soon!? All right I&#146;ll come over there now 
okay? See ya.&#148; Tomoko sighed and put her cell phone in her pocket. 
 
&#147;Was that bad news?&#148; Megumi said, already aware of the answer.
 
&#147;Yeah, I have to get back to the workshop and take care of something, 
for the boss. That guy is a wreck without me.&#148; Tomoko sneakily winked 
at Megumi and the young actress blushed as she smiled. Yuri looked at 
the both of them. They did seem to be much closer now than before. And 
Yuri&#146;s confusion and suspicions increased greatly as she saw Megumi&#146;s 
entranced gaze. 
 
Tomoko took Megumi by the hands and spoke very quietly, loud enough 
for Yuri to hear but still low enough to try and hide something.
 
&#147;I have to cut this short. I&#146;ll speak to you later okay?&#148;
 
Megumi suddenly found extremely hard to breath, and was so fixed onto 
Tomoko that she didn&#146;t even notice Yuri&#146;s quizzical stares.
 
&#147;Okay Tomoko.&#148; The actress said breathlessly.
 
&#147;Can you get home on your own from here? Do you need me to drop you 
off back at your place or...&#148;
 
Megumi cut the biker off with shake of her head. 
 
&#147;No I&#146;m fine. It&#146;s okay, go.&#148;
 
Tomoko nodded and waved goodbye to Megumi and Yuri. Yuri waved back to 
Tomoko as she turned a corner, but Megumi just kind of stood there, 
almost spaced out. Yuri narrowed her eyes at the young actress and 
strode up to her. 
 
&#147;You like Tomoko a lot don&#146;t you.&#148; Megumi snapped into reality as she 
heard Yuri speak to her in a harsh voice. The actress turned around to 
face Yuri&#146;s piercing stare, and suddenly felt nervous.
 
&#147;...I do...she&#146;s my friend.&#148;
 
Yuri snorted and smirked at Megumi. &#147;Humph. &#145;Friend&#146;?&#148;
 
Megumi started to get defensive. She didn&#146;t like the way Yuri was 
talking to her.
 
&#147;Yes that&#146;s right. She&#146;s my friend. Is there anything wrong with 
that?&#148;
 
Yuri abruptly stopped smiling and glared hard at Megumi, who seemed to 
be getting a little angry.
 
&#147;Oh come on. You know as well as I do that you feel a little more than 
friendship towards Tomoko. Even a fool could see that.&#148; 
 
Megumi was prepared to retaliate to Yuri&#146;s words but felt she 
shouldn&#146;t. Yuri was right about that. She did care about Tomoko a 
great deal more than she let on. Megumi bowed her head and fixated on 
the floor beneath her, ducking her eyes away from Yuri&#146;s gaze.
 
&#147;Look I don&#146;t have a problem with that kind of thing, and I don&#146;t know 
what you want from Tomoko but don&#146;t go hurting her.&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s head jerked up and stared into Yuri, with such confusion and 
anger that she automatically clenched her fists to prevent herself 
from doing something Yuri might regret.
 
&#147;How dare you! I would never do anything to hurt Tomoko! How could you 
even think that?&#148; Megumi normally would have found someway to control 
the volume of her voice but was too angry to do so.
 
Yuri exhaled, and narrowed her eyes at the young actress.
 
&#147;Tomoko is my best friend Megumi. We have been since we were six. Her 
mom died just last year and she took it very hard. To top it off she 
doesn&#146;t get on well with her father. She has a lot on her plate at the 
moment. And I don&#146;t want you doing anything to upset her.&#148;
 
Megumi would have gotten madder, but then thought to herself, that 
Yuri must only be concerned about Tomoko&#146;s well being. Just like she 
was.
 
&#147;I couldn&#146;t hurt her. I care about her just as much as you do.&#148;
 
&#147;Maybe so, but I know Tomoko a whole lot better that you do, and 
believe me, she is nowhere near as tough as she makes herself out to 
be.&#148; Yuri said.
 
Megumi couldn&#146;t reply to her, she just felt too shocked by Yuri&#146;s 
accusations to muster a counter. Yuri sighed and took a step towards 
Megumi, gently resting her hand on the actress&#146;s shoulder.
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry Megumi. I just wanna make sure she&#146;ll be okay, that&#146;s all. 
I have to go now, goodbye.&#148;
 
Yuri quickly backed off, as Megumi offered no response, and walked 
away into the dense crowds along the shopping arcade. A stunned Megumi 
sat down by the table again and thought to herself. 
 
{I wouldn&#146;t do that. I care so deeply about her...I would never hurt 
Tomoko...never...}
 
**********
 
Tomoko was at home later that day. She had just finished her work in 
the workshop and was absolutely shattered by it. She may not have been 
particularly feminine but a warm bubble bath sounded like heaven from 
Tomoko&#146;s perspective. Just as the dark haired girl began to walk up 
the stairs to her room, the phone rang. Tomoko sighed and trudged up 
the steps a little faster, eventually reaching the top. Tomoko walked 
over to the hallway phone and placed the receiver to her ear.
 
Tiredly she answered, &#147;Hello?&#148;
 
&#147;Tomoko? Is that you, can I come over? I really need to speak with 
you.&#148; Tomoko instantly forgot about her tiredness as she heard 
Megumi&#146;s distraught voice on the other side.
 
&#147;Megumi? What&#146;s wrong?&#148; The concern in Tomoko&#146;s voice was evident, and 
she would have controlled it but she was becoming to worried about 
Megumi.
 
&#147;Please&#133; Tomoko, I just...I need to see you...please...&#148;
 
&#147;Sure, it&#146;s okay Megumi, do you want me to come and...&#148;
 
&#147;No,&#148; Megumi&#146;s sharpness cut the biker off. &#147;I want to meet you 
there...will you wait for me&#133;?&#148;
 
Tomoko became even more confused. &#147;Certainly.&#148;
 
Megumi quickly said goodbye and hung up. Tomoko could do nothing but 
stare into the receiver, her mind reeling with questions.  
 
&#147;Megumi...what&#146;s wrong...?&#148;
 
**********
 
An hour later, Tomoko sat down on her black leather coach, glad that 
her father was out for the night. It gave her the chance to talk to 
Megumi better that way. As soon as thoughts of Megumi came back to her 
mind, she became more and more worried. She didn&#146;t think she had ever 
heard Megumi sound half as fragile as she did then, and it scared her. 
Tomoko was about to go upstairs to call and see if Megumi had left 
yet, but the doorbell rang just before she could. Tomoko quickly 
shuffled to the door, and unlocked it to see a very worn out, sad and 
hurt Megumi.

Tomoko gasped as she saw her, her pale cheeks were even paler, and her 
once bright eyes seemed...somehow dead...and she was shivering from 
the cold. Megumi seemed so meagre and weak, like her body had lost 
that glow...
 
&#147;...Oh Megumi...&#148;
 
&#147;Can I please come in Tomoko?&#148; Megumi&#146;s voice was so bland...
 
Tomoko instantly led Megumi inside and onto the couch. The dark haired 
girl then ran into the kitchen, quickly whipped up two teas and darted 
back into the living room. Tomoko placed them both on the pine table 
in front of them and sat closely next to Megumi, wrapping her arm 
tightly around the Aquamarine haired girl&#146;s shoulder. 
 
&#147;Megumi...I&#146;m here, now what&#146;s wrong with you?&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s eyes trailed off of the lock they had on the floor, and moved 
up to Tomoko&#146;s searing blue eyes...Tomoko was so beautiful...
 
&#147;I...can&#146;t do it Tomoko...I&#146;ve tried so hard but it won&#146;t go away...I 
can&#146;t keep fighting it...I just...I can&#146;t stop!&#148; 
 
Tomoko&#146;s face twisted into confusion. &#147;I don&#146;t understand you, Megumi. 
What can&#146;t you stop?&#148;
 
Megumi looked away again and down to her hands nestled in her lap. 
Everything Yuri said had gotten to her. All of it.      
 
&#147;Tomoko...you...&#148; Megumi trailed off, confusing Tomoko even more.
 
&#147;Yes? It&#146;s me. I&#146;m here for you.&#148;
 
&#147;Tomoko, you do know that I would never do anything to hurt you, don&#146;t 
you?&#148; 
 
Tomoko tightened the hold she had around Megumi&#146;s shoulder.
 
&#147;Of course I do. I know that, Megumi.&#148;
 
&#147;I&#146;ve been so selfish. And I&#146;m sorry. Things are harder for you then I 
first realized. And for that I&#146;m sorry too. I&#146;ll make it up to you I 
swear Tomoko...I wouldn&#146;t want to do anything to hurt you...not to 
you...I care about you...&#148;
 
Tomoko smiled at Megumi when she heard her say that, and felt the 
butterflies churn in her stomach again... 
 
&#147;I care about you too, Megumi...&#148;

{Maybe it&#146;s about time I told her just how much.} 
 
Tomoko&#146;s head started to crack into gear as she thought about telling 
Megumi how she truly felt, so much so that the dark haired girl barely 
registered Megumi&#146;s soft hands reaching up and stroking her coloured 
cheeks. Megumi gazed helplessly into Tomoko&#146;s sparkling azure eyes, 
briefly forgetting Yuri&#146;s words.
 
&#147;Megumi...?&#148; Tomoko said, her soft voice now masked with incredulity. 
 
Megumi&#146;s eyes fell. &#147;I can&#146;t lie to you anymore. I can&#146;t...&#148;
 
Tomoko closed her eyes and revelled it the feeling of soft, gentle 
hands holding and stroking her blushing face, and by doing so, made up 
her mind. Megumi meant the world to her. And she was going to find out 
now. Tomoko tenderly clasped both of Megumi&#146;s hands and brought the 
down in front of her.
 
&#147;Please stop. I-I must say something to you...It can&#146;t wait.&#148;
 
Megumi looked surprised, as Tomoko suddenly became very nervous and 
tense, her palms shaking as they held Megumi&#146;s.
 
&#147;What is it Tomo-chan?&#148; Megumi said, at least not noticing the terms 
of endearment she placed upon that name. 
 
&#147;You said that you cared for me...and I don&#146;t think you understand how 
much that means to me Megumi...&#148;
 
Megumi was just about to say something in response to that, but Tomoko 
placed a single finger over her lips to silence her. 
 
&#147;I&#146;m not finished yet. Ever since I first saw you in that film, 
&#145;Forget not my love&#146;, I thought you were special. I was only fourteen 
when I first saw you acting, but I felt it even then. You were the one 
Megumi. I had to go through five years of nursing a crush over you, 
and every time I thought about it, it hurt me because I knew I&#146;d never 
meet you...and the very same day that I was beginning to forget about 
you, you walk into my life... It was fate that brought us together 
Megumi...I know that because ever since that day, I&#146;ve felt nothing 
but happiness. To be near you, to hold you...even simply to talk to 
you...it&#146;s made me so happy Megumi...and you&#146;re the cause of it 
all...I need you...I didn&#146;t realize how much until just recently, but 
I do need you...&#148;
 
Megumi would have started to cry at that point, but she held back 
tears to make Tomoko go on. She was about to say what Megumi had 
wanted her to say since the first day they met...
 
&#147;Megumi, what I&#146;m trying to say is...is that...&#148; Tomoko started to 
lose her nerve, but then took a look at Megumi&#146;s pale face, glowing 
red with her blush, her gorgeous diamond eyes...sparkling and 
bright...it was like the life was returning to her, and it only 
hardened the dark haired girl&#146;s resolve.
 
&#147;I&#146;m trying to say that I&#146;m in love with you Megumi!&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s body fell limp with disbelief, she had expected to hear that 
but when it happened...
 
Tomoko turned away. &#147;I know you don&#146;t feel the same way I do. I am so 
sorry Megumi. You probably hate me now I know, but I...just had to 
tell you how I felt. I&#146;m so...&#148; 
 
And just like that, Tomoko&#146;s soft apology was silenced by Megumi 
pressing her silky, crimson red lips up against Tomoko&#146;s. The dark 
haired girl&#146;s eyes widened significantly as Megumi gently kissed her&#133; 
she couldn&#146;t contain herself anymore though, and Tomoko closed her 
eyes as she returned Megumi&#146;s shy kiss. Tomoko involuntarily wound her 
arms around the slim waist of Megumi, and Megumi allowed passage into 
her mouth as Tomoko&#146;s tongue slipped in between her lips. 
Unexpectedly, Tomoko disengaged from the kiss, and rested both her 
palms on Megumi&#146;s shoulders, gently pushing her up to allow her to see 
the actress&#146;s face. Tomoko didn&#146;t know how but for some reason she had 
slid down onto the couch, laid out even with Megumi&#146;s supple body on 
top of her.
 
&#147;...Does this mean that...that you...?&#148;
 
&#147;Please Tomo-chan don&#146;t talk now...just...just kiss me...&#148;
 
Tomoko just smiled and pulled Megumi down closer to her, claiming 
those silky, soft lips for her own... 
 
**********
 
I always thought the first kiss with your loved one was the most 
special, and I was right. I can&#146;t really describe what it was like to 
kiss Tomo-chan; all I know was that it was so totally amazing, I could 
have spent an eternity there...in her arms...kissing each other so 
sweetly. I had now idea that Tomoko could be so compassionate, so 
delicate and charming...when she said that to me, I knew I would be 
hers forever. And that was the way I wanted it. That day was the start 
of our love...and I&#146;d never forget it. After that, Tomo-chan and I 
started dating. It was hard at first; we had to go out in secret 
because I had to conceal my identity, so any fans or photographers 
wouldn&#146;t bother us. But we eventually got used to it, well at least I 
did, and things seemed to be going so well... 
 
**********
 
Three weeks after Tomoko and Megumi confessed their love for each 
other, the two went to a secluded forest, overseeing a beautiful clear 
lake. The sun was setting after a really bright autumn day, so a 
luxurious ruby sunset enveloped the sky. Megumi and Tomoko had spent 
the afternoon there, a little distance from the bank of the lake. The 
two were having a picnic, prepared by Tomoko, just to get away from 
the flash of the city, and spend some real time alone. Megumi was 
sitting on the blanket over the grass, her legs tucked in neatly 
beneath her, while Tomoko was across from her foraging in the picnic 
basket, looking for something. Megumi looked up into the sky again.
 
&#147;It&#146;s beautiful...&#148; Megumi quietly whispered.
 
&#147;What&#146;s beautiful?&#148; Tomoko asked absently, still searching.
 
&#147;The sky...it&#146;s colour...it&#146;s so romantic...so pretty.&#148;
 
Tomoko stopped rummaging in the basket, and walked over to Megumi, who 
turned to look at her as the dark haired girl moved. Tomoko kneeled 
behind the actress, and smiled as she whispered into Megumi&#146;s ear. 
 
&#147;You&#146;re right, it is pretty, just not as pretty as you.&#148; Megumi 
shivered with the close proximity of the biker, and Tomoko grinned, 
pleased to have such an effect on her girlfriend. Tomoko then walked 
back to the basket, and continued to search, and after about five 
minutes of tearing the inside of that basket to shreds, the biker 
grinned triumphantly, and pulled out a long velvet box.
 
&#147;Hey Megumi, can you close you eyes for me?&#148; Tomoko asked.
 
Megumi smiled at her girlfriend. &#147;Why?&#148;
 
&#147;You&#146;ll see.&#148; Just as Tomoko asked, Megumi complied, and the actress 
closed her eyes. Tomoko the walked back behind her, lightly moving 
Megumi&#146;s long aquamarine hair to one side of her shoulders and gently 
resting her chin on the other. 
 
&#147;Now put your arms out in front of you.&#148;
 
Megumi giggled at the request but did so, and placed her hands out in 
front of her, palm facing upwards. Tomoko said nothing else, but 
placed the velvet box into her girlfriend&#146;s palms. Megumi&#146;s breath 
then quickened as she could feel the fabric of the case and already 
made assumptions about what was in it.
 
&#147;Now open your eyes.&#148;
 
Megumi&#146;s eyes fluttered open and her fingers gently worked their magic 
by opening the long velvet box, and Megumi&#146;s eyes widened as she 
looked at what was inside it. It was a more than exquisite silver 
necklace, with a hypnotically eye-catching blue sapphire stone 
dangling at the end of it. On the inside of the box was a note that 
was obviously written by Tomoko, saying &#145;To my darling Megumi, words 
can&#146;t really express how I feel about you, so I hope that this can, 
but understand this and only this, I love you.&#146;
 
&#147;Do you like it?&#148; Tomoko asked, and barely had time to adjust, when 
Megumi turned around abruptly, and kissed her with such passion, it 
shocked her. The actress then hugged the biker tightly as she looked 
at the necklace, the silver links and the sapphire stone shimmering in 
the sunlight.
 
&#147;So you like it?&#148; Tomoko joked, as her girlfriend pulled back from the 
hug for a second. 
 
&#147;I love it Tomo-chan...it&#146;s so wonderful...can you put it on for me?&#148;
 
Tomoko nodded at Megumi&#146;s request, and Megumi shifted around that her 
back faced Tomoko. The biker took the silver necklace and leaned 
forwards, moving the chain over Megumi&#146;s head and dragging it back up. 
Then she slowly attached the clasp and let it dangle freely, the 
actual sapphire jewel situating itself just below the nape of the 
actress&#146;s neck.

Megumi moved back around to look at her girlfriend, the other half of 
her soul, her Tomo-chan&#133; she was so sweet...the butterflies in her 
stomach made a roaring return, and wasn&#146;t scheduled to leave anytime 
soon...Tomoko had such power over Megumi. The actress would move the 
earth even if it simply meant seeing the beauteous biker smile...
 
&#147;I love you so much Tomo-chan...&#148; Megumi said, with half lidded eyes, 
and it was so true, she was hopelessly in love with the girl sitting 
in front of her...Tomoko kissed the actress tenderly, and drew her 
into another warm hug.
 
&#147;I love you too Megumi.&#148;
 
**********
 
After that day, things went very well for Megumi and Tomoko. Tomoko 
had been getting along great at the workshop, and for once, she 
actually started to get along with her father. Megumi had gotten a 
possible part in a film being shot in Okinawa. Things were going were 
going extremely well for the two of them, and after around five months 
after the two met, they returned to the very same place they did meet, 
the Fallen Angel. This time however, they went together. 

&#147;You sure you want to go to a club tonight Megumi?&#148; Tomoko asked, 
while they were standing in front of the Fallen Angel, in the middle 
of a large line that was slowly moving inside. It was at around 10.00, 
and Tomoko was desperate to get inside, as it getting really cold 
outside, and she had to keep running her hands over her arms to stay 
warm. Megumi was standing quietly next to her, and if she was cold she 
certainly wasn&#146;t showing it. 
 
&#147;Yes. It&#146;ll be fun Tomo-chan just wait and see.&#148; Megumi said. 
 
Tomoko looked sceptical &#147;But the last time you came you said that you 
didn&#146;t feel like you belonged here.&#148;
 
Megumi nodded. &#147;That&#146;s true. I did feel out of place. But I have you 
here with me now.&#148;
 
Tomoko smiled lovingly at Megumi, and then the line moved into the 
club more, just enough to allow Megumi and Tomoko to get inside. The 
two lovers then looked for a table in the packed nightclub, Megumi 
managed to spot a free table in the far corner. Tomoko and Megumi 
ploughed through the crowds and reached the table before someone 
snatched it. Megumi sat down on a chair opposite Tomoko, and Tomoko 
did the same. A little later a waitress came over, and the lovers 
ordered some drinks, that the woman brought over just after. For the 
next couple of hours, the two talked and drank, and danced a bit. 
After around three hours of this, Megumi started to get tired and 
chose to go home. 
 
&#147;You sure you wanna go?&#148; Tomoko asked as she sat back down on the 
wooden chair, staring at her aquamarine haired girlfriend, for a 
second, remembering when they had first met each other here. 
 
Megumi let out an exasperated yawn. &#147;Yeah, I&#146;m getting a little tired 
from tonight&#146;s fun, Tomo-chan.&#148;
 
Tomoko laughed as Megumi stretched out, but stopped sharply as a brown 
haired man from the dance floor came up to them with his eyes set on 
Megumi.
 
&#147;I knew it!&#148; The man said, &#147;It&#146;s you, that girl from before!&#148;
 
Megumi looked puzzled for a moment, she was sure she didn&#146;t know this 
guy, but then remembered with some loathing, that this was the man who 
tried to force her into a dance when she first came here, Kenichi.
 
&#147;You...you&#146;re Kenichi.&#148; Megumi said, with a look of disgust beaming 
from her face.
 
Kenichi smirked menacingly at her. &#147;Yep. Still that same stuck-up, 
pompous little tramp you were then, huh?&#148;
 
Megumi looked seriously hurt as he said that, and he would have 
continued to do so until he felt a palm rest on his shoulder. 
 
&#147;What is it?&#148; He said without looking back. &#147;Can&#146;t you see I&#146;m busy?&#148;
 
The hand on his shoulder blade then tightened in grip, and the 
person&#146;s fingernails dug viciously into his shoulder. He yelped a bit, 
and then faced the guy, and met the irate Tomoko, staring into him 
like he was a dead man. The cocky guy smirked again. 
 
&#147;I remember you too. You&#146;re the butch little slut that tried to spoil 
my fun. Oh yes I remember you very well...&#148; 
 
Tomoko felt the anger seeping out of her system, as her teeth grinded 
together, the veins above her head throbbing, and her fists, 
unconsciously clenching together so tightly that the skin around her 
knuckles were turning a pallid white.  
 
&#147;If you know what&#146;s good for you, you&#146;ll get the hell away from her.&#148; 
Tomoko said, unaware of the crowds that were forming around them, or 
the distressed and worried look on Megumi&#146;s face.
 
&#147;Or what? What are you going to do, scratch me to death? Ha, ha, ha, 
step back and let a real man take control honey, a butch little freak 
like you, is out of her depth.&#148;
 
Tomoko&#146;s eyes flashed wide open as she took in his words, and without 
any admonition or warning, the dark haired biker drew back her fist, 
and swung at him, a devilish grin wiping across her features as her 
knuckles smashed into his face, rending flesh apart under their fury. 
Kenichi stumbled backwards, feeling the blood running down his cheek, 
and became vaguely aware of the questioning stares he got from the 
crowds. The bleeding man then lunged at Tomoko, throwing them both 
onto the floor. Kenichi grabbed Tomoko by the throat, and gripped it 
tightly as he drew back the other arm.
 
Kenichi sneered at the biker, forcing her head down as she tried to 
free herself.  &#147;Anyone told you that you punch like a girl?&#148;
 
Despite her situation, Tomoko chuckled at Kenichi, as she grabbed the 
arm with a vice-grip on her neck.
 
&#147;Thanks...maybe someday you could too.&#148; 
 
The angry youth needed no further incentive, and thrust his fist into 
Tomoko&#146;s face. The biker yelped out, but Kenichi continued with his 
assault and punched her again. Megumi quickly ran over to the two and 
grabbed Kenichi by the arm, desperately trying to get him off of 
Tomoko.
 
&#147;Stop it! Please! Let go of her!&#148; Kenichi scowled at the young 
actress, and shoved her back. He then threw her fist at Tomoko again, 
and as it reached within inches of her face, Tomoko caught it with her 
free hand. The other hand wrapped around Kenichi&#146;s arm then snaked its 
way up to his throat, and grasped it so tightly that the young man 
started to choke. Her eyes narrowed into little slits after seeing him 
do that to Megumi, her grasp tightening through every second off 
thinking about it. Two large bouncers then forced their way through 
the crowds, and pulled Kenichi off Tomoko, and with some difficulty, 
freed him from Tomoko&#146;s grip. Kenichi was then pulled back, coughing 
and spluttering as she was dragged back through the crowds. Megumi ran 
up to Tomoko, checking to see if her girlfriend was okay, but the dark 
haired girl&#146;s cerulean eyes where fixed onto the path on which Kenichi 
had been dragged off.
 
{That son of a...I swear by God if I catch that guy again, I&#146;ll kill 
him. I&#146;ll never forgive him for doing those things to Megumi...}
 
&#147;Tomoko! Are you okay?&#148; Tomoko slipped back out of her anger, as she 
stood up, with Megumi&#146;s arms wrapped around her.
 
&#147;Megumi...&#148; Tomoko smiled at her girlfriend, pleased to see that the 
actress was fine. &#147;I&#146;m fine... let&#146;s go.&#148;
 
**********
 
&#147;I wish you wouldn&#146;t have fought that guy Tomoko.&#148; Megumi said. 
 
The two were back at Tomoko&#146;s house, and her father was out for the 
night, which was lucky enough, Tomoko didn&#146;t want to have to explain 
the situation at the Fallen Angel. Tomoko and Megumi were upstairs in 
Tomoko&#146;s room. The two were sitting on the bed; Tomoko had her eyes 
closed as Megumi pressed a cold compress over the slight bruise she 
had gotten from her fight with Kenichi. 
 
&#147;Why? He was asking for it Megumi. He had no right to treat you like 
that.&#148; Tomoko still remembered the things Kenichi said, and it gave 
birth to anger so strong that Tomoko felt overwhelmed by it.
 
&#147;I know, but it&#146;s just...he hurt you Tomo-chan...I didn&#146;t like it. It 
frightened me to know that he was hurting you.&#148; Megumi had now stopped 
pressing the compress on Tomoko&#146;s cheek, placing it the nightstand 
next to the bed. 
 
Tomoko held her girlfriend tight in a loving embrace, stroking soft 
strands of the actress&#146;s aquamarine hair.
 
&#147;It&#146;s okay Megumi. I&#146;m fine. But if you don&#146;t like it, I wont swing 
for anyone who tries that with you, okay?&#148; Tomoko had intended that to 
be sarcastic, but Megumi took it literally.
 
Megumi sniffled a bit. &#147;Thank you.&#148;
 
Tomoko looked hard at Megumi, she was so kind and sweet, so charming 
and cute. The biker loved the way Megumi was so affectionate. And it 
made her even happier to know that that affection was being directed 
to her. How Tomoko was lucky enough to be able to hold Megumi in her 
arms was something she would never know. Tomoko let Megumi go for a 
second, and the young actress gently kissed her. Tomoko unconsciously 
ran her hands through the actress&#146;s silky hair, and tenderly pulled 
Megumi even closer to her. So close that Megumi felt the biker&#146;s chest 
pressed up against her own. The young actress then withdrew from their 
kiss and looked up at her Tomo-chan...
 
&#147;Tomoko, please...make love to me...&#148;
 
Tomoko was initially stunned at what Megumi had just said to her, but 
her request was so fragile, so heart-felt and needing, that she could 
not refuse. Tomoko lightly pushed Megumi down onto the bed, and began 
to kiss her again. The young actress then gasped wildly, as Tomoko&#146;s 
hand slipped under her blouse...
 
**********                   
 
Megumi&#146;s eyes fluttered open as warm, morning sunrays of light shone 
through the window and lingered on her. She slowly turned her head 
around to see Tomoko, her slender arms wrapped lovingly around the 
actress&#146;s tight waist. Megumi rolled around slowly as not to wake her, 
or break to embrace Tomoko had on her waist, and smiled at the dark 
haired biker. The actress could have stayed like that forever, simply 
admiring her beauty...Megumi leaned up on her elbow, playfully kissed 
Tomoko on the forehead, and snuggled closer to her Tomo-chan, and let 
herself slip back into sleep, revelling in memories of last night... 
 
**********
 
I didn&#146;t like what happened at the Fallen Angel, but I did like what 
it led to. That was the first time Tomo-chan and I slept together. And 
it was amazing. I had at last found the love of my life and I was 
happy with her, just as happy as she was with me. So then why did 
things have to get so screwed up after that?
 
**********
 
Three weeks after that very night, things continued to run smoothly 
between Tomoko and Megumi. But good times have a habit of ending, 
especially when you least want them to...
	
&#147;Megumi!&#148; Miki shouted out to Megumi, who was upstairs listening to 
music, in the Murasaki mansion. Megumi than yelled back out to her 
mom, all the while, still not moving.
 
&#147;Yes Mom?&#148; She called out.
 
Miki sighed. &#147;It&#146;s your agent on the phone!&#148;
 
Megumi blinked in her surprise, and quickly stood up to go out the 
door. Megumi walked out into the corridor, and picked up the phone on 
the coffee table outside her door.
 
&#147;I&#146;ve got it Mom!&#148; Megumi yelled, and began to speak to her agent.
 
&#147;Hi sir. What&#146;s this all about? My part in that film in taking place 
in Okinawa? Yes I&#146;m looking forward to...what? Are you being serious&#133; 
how could you make a mistake like that? When is it? That soon? How can 
you expect me to just pick up and...well I didn&#146;t know it was that 
important...but...yeah, goodbye.&#148;
 
Megumi put the receiver down the cradle, and the aquamarine haired 
girl leaned back on the wall, burying her face into her palms, as sobs 
began to spring from her throat. 
 
Megumi silently started to whisper...&#147;How can I...how can I tell her?&#148;
 
**********
 
Later on, Megumi met up with Tomoko, and they went to a fast food 
restaurant. Tomoko would have preferred to eat in a different place 
but Megumi said she fancied a change of pace. Inside, the two were 
sitting across from each other, and while Megumi was very nervous and 
edgy, Tomoko was stuffing her face with the food before her.
 
&#147;Tomo-chan. Can we talk?&#148; Megumi asked quietly.
 
Tomoko took a bite of her burger. &#147;Sure Megumi.&#148;
 
Megumi clasped her hands together in a ball on the table. &#147;Well, you 
know that part I was offered about a month ago?&#148;
 
Tomoko sipped her milkshake. &#147;Yep. The one in Okinawa, right?&#148;
 
The childhood actress took a deep breath. &#147;Yes, well, there&#146;s been a 
little change of plan with that...&#148;
 
Tomoko snagged a fry. &#147;What&#146;s that?&#148;
 
Megumi sighed, and shuffled in her seat. &#147;My part isn&#146;t in Okinawa.&#148;
 
Tomoko took another bite out of her burger, all the while not looking 
up. &#147;Where is it then?&#148; Tomoko swallowed. &#147;Somewhere closer to home?&#148;
 
&#147;It&#146;s in America.&#148;
 
Tomoko suddenly stopped eating...
 
Megumi continued, the neutral glare that Tomoko was throwing at her 
scared her so much... &#147;It&#146;s a martial arts movie. I&#146;m supposed to play 
the little sister of an American star, who has been kidnapped...and if 
I take it...it will mean that I&#146;ll have to spend five and a half 
months there.&#148;
 
Tomoko looked directly at Megumi, and then smiled incredulously.
 
&#147;You&#146;re not actually thinking about taking it are you?&#148;
 
Megumi looked away from Tomoko&#146;s eyes, and squirmed on the seat.
 
&#147;My agent says it could really set me off...&#148;
 
Tomoko&#146;s eyes widened significantly, as what Megumi just said sunk in. 
 
&#147;You are thinking about it!&#148; Tomoko almost yelled, ignoring the people 
around them who turned to see what the commotion was about.
 
&#147;Tomo-chan I...&#148;
 
&#147;I can&#146;t believe you&#146;re actually thinking about leaving me!&#148; Tomoko 
yelled again, trying but horribly failing to control her voice.
 
&#147;I haven&#146;t said I&#146;m taking it yet Tomoko!&#148; Megumi yelled back. She 
didn&#146;t really like to yell that much but Tomoko could be so hard 
headed&#133;
 
Tomoko took in a deep breath, to try and calm herself, and fiddled 
with her hands to keep them occupied. At the moment she felt like 
kicking down a wall or punching a waiter.
 
&#147;If you confirm that you want to take this part, when will you have to 
leave?&#148; Tomoko asked.
 
&#147;I never said I would-&#148; before she could continue, the biker cut her 
off. 
 
&#147;When Megumi?&#148; Tomoko asked again, this time much more sharply.
 
&#147;...Tomorrow.&#148;
 
Tomoko&#146;s heart suddenly fell. &#147;...What?&#148;
 
Megumi lowered her head as a tear ran her left cheek.
 
&#147;I&#146;d have to leave tomorrow at 6.00, if I except it.&#148;
 
Tomoko felt the blood in her every vein run cold. The woman she loved 
was sitting across from her and by 6.00 tomorrow, she&#146;d never be able 
to see her again for the next six months. Megumi would be gone...
 
Tomoko lowered her head in sadness, and her fist clenched at the 
unfairness of the situation. Why did this have to happen to her?
 
&#147;You&#146;re gonna go aren&#146;t you?&#148; Tomoko said, her voice already broken.
 
&#147;Tomoko, I never said I was going to take it.&#148;
 
&#147;But you are thinking about it though. Aren&#146;t you?&#148;
 
&#147;...&#148; Megumi couldn&#146;t answer that. She was right...
 
&#147;You see. You can&#146;t lie to me Megumi. You wanna take it...&#148;
 
Tomoko quickly rose and began to leave, suddenly she didn&#146;t feel very 
hungry...just...empty... Megumi sprang up in surprise of Tomoko&#146;s 
motion to leave, and hastily grabbed the bikers&#146; wrist.
 
&#147;Where are you going Tomo-chan?&#148;
 
&#147;Come on Megumi,&#148; Tomoko&#146;s attempt at contempt wrought into a sob. 
&#147;W-we knew it was gonna end s-sometime...why drag it out...?&#148;
 
Megumi started to cry freely, tears staining her pale skin, still 
un-aware of the amount of people looking at them. 
 
&#147;Tomo-chan...I never...I never said that I was going to take it...&#148;
 
&#147;Stop saying that!&#148; Tomoko turned around abruptly as her shining 
dewdrop tears fell from her face.
 
&#147;You know as well as I do that your leaving me.&#148; Tomoko looked away. 
&#147;Don&#146;t you dare humour me by saying we still have a chance.&#148;
 
Megumi couldn&#146;t think of anything to say that could make this better. 
And now she became distinctly aware of what she was about to lose.
 
&#147;I love you Tomoko...&#148;
 
The biker&#146;s head jerked as she heard Megumi play upon her one 
weakness...She instantly felt the need hold the woman she loved in her 
arms, once more...but she knew if she did...she wouldn&#146;t be able to 
let go...Tomoko didn&#146;t respond to her, but bolted out the door, 
barging all those in front of her, out of her way. Megumi would have 
run after the biker, but felt that might not be the best thing to do, 
nor would it be what Tomoko would have wanted. The young actress 
collapsed to her knees, crying her eyes out. She had just lost the 
woman she cared about most in the world...forever. Yuri was right; all 
she would do in the end was hurt Tomoko. Once again, her career had 
succeeded in destroying her life.
 
**********
 
The next day, Megumi was a wreck. She hadn&#146;t slept a wink last night; 
the constant reminder that she would never see her Tomo-chan again 
plagued her. She had tried calling Tomoko&#146;s workshop, but the guys 
there said Tomoko had taken the day off. Megumi then tried to call her 
house, but Tomoko&#146;s father just kept saying she wasn&#146;t in. By now it 
was 4.59, and in just an hour&#146;s time she would have to leave Tokyo, 
and she would never see Tomoko again, at least not for a good half of 
a year. Megumi just broke into more sobs as she thought about it...is 
this what it all came down to?
 
**********
 
Tomoko was sitting on her couch, the very same couch she had first 
kissed Megumi, and she kept looking back at the clock. She tried to 
calm herself, as she felt like if she didn&#146;t do something soon, her 
life would be over...after she ran out of the restaurant yesterday, 
she felt extremely guilty about just leaving Megumi there, especially 
since the aquamarine haired girl had told Tomoko that she loved her. 
 
(I love you Tomoko...)     
 
Tomoko grimaced as she tried to shake the thoughts of Megumi out of 
her head. She didn&#146;t like this, but Megumi was gone. She had to except 
that. The biker then decided she needed some fresh air. Tomoko walked 
through the front door and then outside, and she sat down on the bench 
just beside her front door. Tomoko then observed someone walking 
towards her, in her minds eye she saw Megumi, but after closer 
inspection, was revealed that it was Yuri. 
 
&#147;Hey girl.&#148;
 
&#147;Hey.&#148; Tomoko would have offered a more polite greeting, but was just 
to...
 
&#147;I heard about Megumi leaving today.&#148; Yuri took a seat next to the 
biker. Tomoko looked away.
 
&#147;I don&#146;t disapprove Tomoko. But I do think you gave up to easily.&#148;
 
&#147;She&#146;ll be leaving in an hour&#146;s time, what&#146;s the point?&#148;
 
 Yuri face contorted into a mask of shock, disbelief and just a little 
anger.
 
&#147;Listen to you! &#145;What&#146;s the point?&#146; You have changed Tomoko. The old 
Tomoko wouldn&#146;t just sit here and whine, the old Tomoko would go out 
there get what she wants. It&#146;s more than obvious that you don&#146;t want 
Megumi to leave, so go out there and stop her!&#148;
 
Tomoko stared at Yuri, in bewilderment at Yuri&#146;s sudden interest in 
her relationship with Megumi.
 
&#147;Why...why do you want me to go after her?&#148; Tomoko asked, still 
perplexed by her best friend&#146;s concern with her and Megumi.
 
Yuri leaned back on the bench, and looked out in front of her.
 
&#147;It&#146;s because she makes you happy Tomoko. And I didn&#146;t realize that 
until now. Now go, go and get her back. Go to that airport and make 
sure that she doesn&#146;t leave.&#148;
 
Tomoko smiled, and hugged her best friend. 

&#147;Thanks Yuri. Tell my dad I&#146;m leaving for me yeah?&#148; Yuri nodded, and 
Tomoko ran out, around the back of her house, and within minutes she 
peeled out of the driveway on her bike and zoomed down the road, 
driving off into the far distance.
 
**********
 
Outside of the Murasaki mansion, Megumi waited. Standing on the front 
lawn, waiting for Tomoko to just drive up and stop her from leaving. 
But no such luck. A single tear slid down Megumi&#146;s pale cheeks. Not 
only was she leaving behind the love of her life, but she was also 
leaving behind her only true friend. But if Tomoko didn&#146;t value her 
enough to even say goodbye, then what was the point in staying? The 
actress then heard her parents honking from the car, and she walked 
over, opened the door, took one last look at the mansion and got in.
 
{Goodbye Tomoko.}
 
**********
 
About 45 minutes later, Megumi was standing alone in front of the 
airline gate, her parents had just dropped her off, and they would 
come to America with her in a few days, while Megumi stayed with a 
distant relative until they got there. The final boarding was about to 
start, and as soon as she got on that plane&#133; Tomoko would be lost to 
her. 
 
A voice over the intercom then told her that her row was supposed to 
enter. This was it. The dream was over. And as she looked into the 
passenger entry line, she realized the truth&#133;
 
**********
 
Tomoko ploughed through the crowds of people in her way, and she would 
have apologized to them but she had no time. Suddenly she saw the 
doors around the passenger entry closed up, and took note of the 
country it was going to. Tomoko stared blankly as she understood the 
situation. She blew it. The one woman she had ever really loved was 
gone. Gone for good. She had always known Megumi would be leaving, but 
it only just dawned on her that she was *gone*. She could neither see 
nor speak to the Aquamarine haired girl, and the worst thing was, she 
didn&#146;t even get the chance to apologize or say goodbye. The other half 
of her soul was here no longer. There would be no one to hold and care 
for her, no one to love and protect her, and there would be no one to 
call her Tomo-chan. Tomoko moved out of the crowds, back to the side 
hall and down the stairs. As soon as she got outside, she leaned in on 
the stonewall. The dark haired biker then leaned up and thrust her 
fist into the wall, ignoring the trail of blood that flowed down from 
it, laughing a scornful laugh full of self-loathing at herself.
 
&#147;And I was the idiot who gave it up.&#148;
 
**********
 
Tomoko drove back home, the sun setting down now, as it was just 
reaching around 8.00. Yuri was still waiting on the porch bench for 
some reason, but Tomoko barely noticed her...Tomoko pulled over as she 
drove into the garage, and the biker walked back out into the front, 
her steps groggy and her head throbbing after driving around for so 
long, cursing and mentally beating herself up for destroying her own 
love, thanks to her own damn irrational behaviour...Yuri ran up to the 
dark haired girl, with a questioning look on her face.
 
&#147;So did you do it? Did you stop Megumi from leaving?&#148; 
 
Tomoko&#146;s self-hating rut was at its peak.
 
&#147;Ha, ha, ha. No...she&#146;s gone. Forever. Megumi is gone and the last 
thing I did when I saw her was run.&#148; 
 
&#147;Tomo-chan, are you okay? You don&#146;t seem-&#148;
 
&#147;Don&#146;t call me that!&#148; Tomoko yelled irately, and shoved Yuri out of 
the way as she trudged across the road, towards the nearest bar. 
Anywhere but here. She just needed a drink or something. 
 
Yuri suddenly became very worried, Tomoko only ever acted like this 
when something really bad happened to her, just like when her mother 
died... 
 
&#147;Tomoko, I know how you&#146;re feeling, but please don&#146;t do this...&#148; Yuri 
yelled to her. 
 
Tomoko had just managed to hear what Yuri said, and smirked.
 
&#147;You don&#146;t have a clue how I feel...&#148;
 
**********
 
Tomoko was at a bar, she didn&#146;t know which bar, nor where it really 
was, she just kept walking until she found something. All she did was 
to just keep drinking, one after one, not noticing anything around 
her. All she could feel was the pain, and it&#146;s merciless nature ripped 
her heart apart...it was all over, and she had no one to blame but 
herself...
 
&#147;Tomo-chan?&#148;
 
Tomoko sneered at herself, as the simple and sweet voice of Megumi 
bore into her. The voice she&#146;d never hear again...
 
&#147;Tomoko?&#148;
 
The dark haired biker grimaced as she grabbed her pounding head with 
her shaking hands, and willed herself to gain control.
 
&#147;Get...outta my...head.&#148; She slurred, she speech impaired by alcohol.
 
The biker then forced her hands tighter on her head, trying in vain to 
exorcise the demons plaguing her mind. Tomoko then froze upright, as a 
hand rested itself on her left shoulder, and she heard her voice 
again...
 
&#147;Tomoko, please...&#148;
 
Tomoko was either going insane, or...the biker quickly span around on 
the stool she was on, and looked up at the one who had rested their 
hand on her shoulder. Tomoko rubbed her eyes twice, and them focused 
so hard so the figure before her, she could have seen through her, but 
after check and re-check, she realized she wasn&#146;t hallucinating. A 
beautiful young woman stood before her, her elfin like face enveloped 
in a shimmering waterfall of Aquamarine hair...
 
&#147;Megumi...? Is it really you?&#148; The dark haired biker asked, this time 
she was the one with the feeble and frigid voice. Megumi didn&#146;t say 
anything at all; she just flung herself into Tomoko&#146;s arms, and broke 
into deep, painful sobs.
 
&#147;Tomoko! I&#146;m sorry, just couldn&#146;t leave you&#133; I couldn&#146;t Tomo-chan...it 
was just so hard...I had to see you again!&#148;
 
Tomoko looked down and realized she wasn&#146;t going crazy...Megumi, 
she...she was here, in her arms...again. The dark haired biker hugged 
the young actress even harder, crying softly into her shoulder.
 
&#147;Oh Megumi...please...don&#146;t ever leave me...don&#146;t leave me...&#148;
 
Megumi then leaned up, softly wiping the tears out of Tomoko&#146;s eyes 
and her own, and the actress smiled lovingly at the dark haired woman 
before her, so happy to be in her arms again.
 
&#147;I won&#146;t Tomo-chan. Trust me. I&#146;ll never let you go...&#148;
 
**********
 
I&#146;m glad that I didn&#146;t go to America that day. There was too much that 
I would have been leaving behind for me to go. And when I got back, 
the first thing I did, was look for Tomo-chan...I couldn&#146;t imagine 
living a life without her...I needed her so much. And I still do. But 
after that day, we never really had another bad day, of course we had 
our arguments but we could barely keep away from each other. Our lives 
were pure, she relied on me, and I relied on her, Tomo-chan and 
I...and most of all, I never let her go.
 
**********
 
An older, more mature Megumi stood up from the desk she was sitting 
at, and placed the pen in her hand down, next to the thick book she 
had be writing in. She was just about to leave her study to get 
something to drink, but only chuckled, when she felt a pair of strong 
arms wrap lovingly around her waist.
 
&#147;Aren&#146;t you finished writing in that that damn diary yet sweetheart?&#148;
 
Said an older Tomoko, feigning frustration in her words. Megumi only 
smiled to herself, and turned around into her wife&#146;s embrace, gently 
kissing her on the nose. 
 
&#147;Just finished a part of it Tomo-chan. I still have quite a lot to 
write about. I haven&#146;t even gotten to the part where you proposed to 
me.&#148;
 
The dark haired girl grinned at her wife. &#147;Yeah, I guess that was 
kinda the best part wasn&#146;t it? So Mrs Megumi Seiyunzuki, what if you 
take a little break and devote some of that attention to me?&#148;
 
A sly smile traced its way onto Megumi&#146;s visage. &#147;To do what?&#148;
 
Tomoko whistled to herself, before answering. &#147;I&#146;m sure you can think 
of something now can&#146;t you?&#148;
 
Megumi only smiled, as Tomoko led her out of the study and towards 
their bedroom. Even today, nearly six years after they first met, 
Tomoko still had power over Megumi...
 
&#147;I&#146;ll never let you go, Tomoko.&#148;
