&quot;Hi, honey!&quot;

Emma McGowen smiled merrily as she burst through her front door. 
Awaiting her, she knew, was her current girlfriend, the displaced but 
warmhearted Andeira Torvald, who coincidentally was the foreign 
languages teacher at Stanton. She closed the door and slapped the mail 
on her kitchen counter as she went looking for her older lover.

&quot;Andy?&quot; she spoke, using the nickname she had given her. &quot;Andy, ya home? 
Your faithful sidekick has arrived. I&#39;ve got a special book I think we 
could read together. Are you home? Are you sick? In bed?&quot; Any of those 
could&#39;ve been a possibility. Though strong, Andeira was more of a 
recluse, a chosen hermit, and she would not have been out unless 
necessary. She had been going in and out of illnesses recently, and 
might&#39;ve been recovering somewhere, or else just napping, happily 
displaced from the world. A lot of things went on in the older woman&#39;s 
head, and that&#39;s what McGowen liked: chaos, controlled. She adored 
&quot;Andy&quot; and couldn&#39;t wait to pounce on her taller frame.

&quot;Andy?&quot; she said, poking her head through their bedroom. The sheets were 
made, which meant she had been there earlier, but was not in the room at 
the time. She tried the bathroom and kitchen, and found her, of all 
places, in the small garden she had. McGowen was a student of all 
sciences; horticulture and biology were just two of the fields she 
liked, so naturally she had a garden.

&quot;There you are!&quot; she exclaimed merrily. Andeira, beautiful albeit eight 
years Em&#39;s senior, stood up from her botanical reverie and put her hands 
behind her back in a very serious fashion. She had light-brown skin, 
mostly from ancestry since she didn&#39;t get out too often, and was half a 
foot taller than her girlfriend, although not nearly as intimidating or 
eccentric. Her eyes were glazed over, as if from years of dull living, 
but her smile persisted onward, though not at that moment. It was plain 
to see she had things on her mind.

&quot;Hi,&quot; she murmured as Emma put her arms around her waist. The smaller, 
younger woman kissed her jaw and cheek, and looked up with bright eyes. 
Andeira met her back with dull ones, and a sigh. Emma immediately became 
grave.

&quot;Something the matter, love?&quot;

&quot;Uh, well, yes Emma. I have something to say, and I&#39;m afraid it&#39;s going 
to break your heart.&quot;

&quot;Oh no.&quot; Emma chilled and took a step back. Her blue eyes turned sharp, 
her face cold and attentive. Andeira took a slow breath, and tried to 
remember all the words she had rehearsed during the time she arrived at 
the small house&#151;during the whole week she had been in contemplation. Her 
lips pursed before she started.

&quot;Emma,&quot; began, &quot;I don&#39;t think we can&#151;I don&#39;t think we should see each 
other like this.&quot;

&quot;How should we see each other?&quot; she replied, a bit of merriment still in 
her voice. Andeira was too serious for jokes or coyness.

&quot;We should see each other as coworkers in the same business,&quot; she 
answered, &quot;not as lovers. Em, you know I&#39;m not gay. You know I&#39;ve never 
considered a relationship with a woman, much less two. You know what 
happened the last time a girl came onto me, and... you know I swore to 
myself I&#39;d never let that happen again.&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Emma was sharp, but her girlfriend&#39;s speech was too much to 
take in at once. She had to fight to defend herself, and only from one 
thing at a time. &quot;Well what about me? I mean, you sort of became 
attached to me, and I started liking you, and... well, you know, I was 
in a difficult period of my life&#151;a transition, from college to 
professional life. I was still mixed up.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all you need to say,&quot; said Andeira sharply. &quot;Emma, I appreciate 
your friendship, and I&#39;m grateful I had somebody to fall on while I was 
getting my bearings, but... we just can&#39;t see each other. I was too weak 
and too confused to say something before, and... part of me did like it, 
even though I knew it wasn&#39;t what I wanted to get into. You said 
yourself you never thought you&#39;d ever be with another woman again.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but&#151;&quot;

&quot;Listen, Em,&quot; said Torvald firmly, &quot;I&#39;m trying to end this quickly and 
bloodlessly. I don&#39;t want to be your lover or any other woman&#39;s lover 
ever again. If for nothing else, my son would never approve. It&#39;d be 
like I had forgotten my entire ordeal back all those years ago, and I 
don&#39;t want to forget that. I was in transition too, Em&#151;but what we did 
was not good for me. And from what little you&#39;ve told me, it wasn&#39;t good 
for you either.&quot;

&quot;Andy...&quot; Emma had lost, she knew she had. Her scientific mind could not 
win against the heart, against painful reasoning like this. She had 
condemned herself, she knew she had. Just one glaring mistake after 
another; her life had been one big mess ever since graduation from 
college. She was losing another lover, her heart was being broken 
again&#151;they had a gun to her head and were ready to pull the trigger. But 
desperate times...

&quot;Andy, I love you. I&#39;ve grown to love you since&#151;&quot;

&quot;Em,&quot; said Andeira, but it sounded like she was growling, &quot;don&#39;t. Just 
don&#39;t. It will be better this way. I&#39;ll complete one more year of 
teaching here, then I&#39;ll move. I&#39;ve already decided that. I can&#39;t be 
anywhere near you, or anywhere else I want to be. If I wanted to follow 
my heart, I&#39;d be... oh, never mind. Just forget it. I&#39;ll need a few days 
to move my stuff; please don&#39;t help me. In fact, I think it&#39;d be best if 
you went to a hotel or something and stayed there until I was finished.&quot;

&quot;Andy...&quot;

&quot;Emma...&quot; Andeira Torvald frowned sadly, but did not touch her former 
lover like she wanted to. She didn&#39;t really do anything, except stare 
and express great pain through her hazy eyes. &quot;You go on and do what you 
must,&quot; she ultimately decided to say. &quot;I&#39;ll move on, and hopefully 
regain some semblance of a normal life. Those girls still need you, but 
I won&#39;t ever be missed.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but&#151;&quot;

&quot;Em.&quot; McGowen didn&#39;t relent.

&quot;You do know about Ms. O&#39;Brien, right? About how her class and yours are 
going to merge next year?&quot; Andeira shrugged indifferently, and walked 
back into the house she had shared with Em for a long time.

&quot;Bernie can find someone to replace me. I&#39;m sure there are better, more 
stable linguistics teachers out there than me. I just don&#39;t want to stay 
here any longer. Good-bye, Emma. And may that be the end of our 
relationship, though I did enjoy it while it lasted, and I wish you 
better fortune and knowledge in the future.&quot; Torvald went into the house 
and immediately busied herself with work. Emma hugged herself, weather 
notwithstanding, and stood out there in her yard for such a long time, 
her legs began to hurt. She avoided entering the house as she walked 
back to her car, not an hour after she had left it, and drove away. She 
didn&#39;t cry, but only because she felt too sick.

Emma McGowen ultimately ended up renting a cheap hotel room to give her 
ex-lover a respectable berth, but did not sleep very well. The upcoming 
promise of a weekend did not lift her spirits at all.

.........

The next day, Friday, Emma avoided Andeira out of respect for the 
woman&#39;s wishes. Her science classes sagged and dragged due to her 
tormented feelings, and even the students felt her turmoil. She was no 
longer the loveably weird woman they all knew, but snappy, impatient, 
more dangerous than usual, unpredictable, and worst&#151;to the students&#151;her 
tests were even harder and her grading was more merciless. A few griped, 
but those that knew McGowen well enough could forgive her, because they 
saw the hurt on her face.

Olivia Johnson knew what hurt felt like, because she lived with it 
daily. Her limp, given to her by mild cerebral palsy, was proof enough, 
and her emotional state of mind was just as skewed, so naturally, she 
was one of the first to confront her teacher.

&quot;Miss McGowen?&quot; she asked, once she and the teacher were alone. She had 
one more class to attend before the day was over, but she could afford 
to be late. &quot;Are you feeling okay? You really don&#39;t look your best.&quot; The 
smallish teacher sighed as she gathered her papers to her like chicks, 
not bothering to lie with an &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot;.

&quot;Oh, I got dumped,&quot; she answered sadly. Olivia, knowing what it was like 
to have a relationship broken off, gave her teacher a knowing look. 
&quot;Yeah,&quot; resumed McGowen, &quot;but I guess it was for the best, and she had a 
few good points. I really screwed things up.&quot;

&quot;How so? Did you neglect her or&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, no. Sorry, I don&#39;t think I can tell you. The teacher-student 
relationship shouldn&#39;t be affected because of my romantic 
happenings&#151;besides, the whole matter is personal.&quot;

&quot;You listen when we tell you our troubles,&quot; she defended, and it was 
true. Olivia could attest; she had counseled McGowen before. Emma nodded 
her head but still kept her silence.

&quot;Yes... but this is deeply, deeply personal, and there are many things 
you probably keep secret from your closest friends.&quot;

Olivia said nothing. This, too, was true.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; groaned McGowen, rubbing her eyes until they became bleary, &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t be acting this way. I&#39;ve got a lot of work to do. I didn&#39;t 
mean to make you feel&#151;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not. I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; Olivia&#39;s lip raised in a smile.

&quot;Well, I forgive you. I hope you can find some peace of mind, Miss 
McGowen. I have to get to class.&quot;

&quot;Mm, you go, Liv. Don&#39;t worry about me, I&#39;ll get over it. I just have to 
talk to somebody that can help me.&quot;

&quot;Miss Keeping?&quot; Emma paused and thought about it. That had not been her 
idea, but it was a good suggestion.

&quot;No, but I might speak with her later. You have a nice day, Liv.&quot;

&quot;I probably won&#39;t,&quot; muttered Johnson as she left, adjusting her glasses 
all the way. Emma sighed and splayed her head and arms on the desk 
wearily. She stayed that way until the first student of her last class 
of the day walked in. She picked herself up sheepishly, smiled in 
apology, and lifted herself back to her feet. She had been an emotional 
wreck all day, and she owed it to at least one class to appear normal.

Well, as normal as Em could get, anyway.

.........

Something deeper, much more painful than merely being apart from Andeira 
ate at McGowen&#39;s soul, something that crushed her and caused her to be 
so upset even during business hours. Parting with her beloved would not 
have been so terrible if that had been the whole matter, but 
unfortunately, it was only a small piece of a larger, more agonizing 
puzzle, one that Emma had irreversibly destroyed through her own foolish 
or selfish actions. She had done far worse to others, and she knew she 
would have to pay for it, because right after her last class, she went 
straight to the one person she knew she could talk to, the school 
doctor.

And she was the last person Emma should&#39;ve seen on that matter.

The door was open, which meant Dr. Andrews didn&#39;t have any patients. She 
would have time, perhaps, to listen to McGowen&#39;s troubles, but how she 
would react to them and advise the smallish woman, Emma could only hope. 
At best, the doctor would tell her the truth, objectively and 
professionally, like a true doctor. At worst, their relationship would 
be unrecognizable from the strain. Emma saw the tall, masculine outline 
of Doc Andrews from the hallway, and knocked meekly before letting 
herself in.

&quot;Uh, hi Jackie,&quot; she said quietly. Dr. Jean-Jacques Andrews frowned and 
nodded as courteously as she knew how.

&quot;McGowen. What brings you here?&quot;

&quot;Uh, can we talk?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m very busy.&quot;

&quot;Your door was open.&quot;

&quot;With forms.&quot; Em saw the impressive stack and chewed her lip.

&quot;Just a few seconds.&quot;

&quot;Unless you&#39;re ill or hurt, I&#39;ll have to ask you to leave.&quot; Em stood, 
though shyly (which was unlike her), and played with her fingers. Dr. 
Andrews was even taller than Andeira, reaching six feet in height, and 
could look over some men&#39;s shoulders. She was younger than McGowen and 
by no means as sprightly; the woman was all business at work and a dark 
mystery outside, and only Emma really knew her well, since...

&quot;Andeira broke up with me,&quot; whispered McGowen. Dr. Andrews gave her a 
very malicious stare.

&quot;And you&#39;re telling me because you think I&#39;d care? Or that it&#39;d make 
things better?&quot;

&quot;Jackie...&quot;

&quot;I am doctor during school hours, professor,&quot; she stated harshly. 
&quot;You&#39;ve done me enough discourtesy in the past; please don&#39;t continue 
anymore. Now. I was in a good mood today up until now, no patients and 
nothing serious from Miss Blair&#39;s department...&quot; At this, she indicated 
a very large file of papers, all taken from Furious Hail&#39;s medical past: 
drugs they were mostly, largely illegal, but some of it consisted of 
self-inflicted injuries, and worse, injuries she had given others. Dr. 
Andrews continued, &quot;So I&#39;ll spare you my cruelty by not taking pleasure 
in my... observations of your emotional state. If you needed somebody to 
talk to, Dr. Keeping is your woman; I only take care of physical 
ailments. Now, McGowen, are you in any physical pain?&quot;

&quot;...No,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Very well then, please leave my office.&quot; She turned her head, 
dismissing Em, and resumed her work, but McGowen, like a bad smell or 
memory, lingered behind.

&quot;Jackie, I know I deserve you being cruel to me, but I really&#151;&quot;

&quot;Leave, please, or I&#39;ll have Headmistress Marbel take you.&quot; It was a 
promise, not a threat, so McGowen took it and relented, for the time. 
She backed away from the doctor&#39;s office, hugged herself from the pain, 
and decided to leave for home, or perhaps the hotel if Andeira was still 
taking her things. Keeping was probably talking to somebody else, 
anyway.

But when Emma McGowen got on the road, and drove towards her hotel, she 
began to weep and silently whimpered to herself. The weather was oddly 
depressing in its late-summer warmth, the singing birds painful, the 
occasional couple of lovers an ironic stab. She just wanted to go to bed 
and ride out the weekend in peace, but the shackles of her past squeezed 
tighter, weighed down heavier, and shook louder than before. She was 
locked and bound; those who held the keys held them stubbornly, for good 
reason: McGowen deserved to be locked up, after what she had done.

When she got to the hotel, she undressed and showered, and went to bed 
naked, trying to pleasure herself into sleep and false bliss. She could 
still feel the arms around her, the legs rubbing up against her, the 
chest thudding and expanding with pulse and breath, the cheek happy and 
the lips warm. The memory was painful, like a cold barrel of steel to 
her neck. Click. Boom.

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

And if we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

And I&#39;ve got a twenty-dollar bill

that says you&#39;re up late night starting

fist fights versus fences in your backyard
Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor

Soaking in sympathy

from friends who never loved you

nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable...ohoh

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

If we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

You never knew

Well I never told you...

Everything I know about breaking hearts

I learned from you, it&#39;s true

I&#39;ve never done it with the style and grace you have

But I&#39;ve made long term plans

based on these mistakes

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Is this what you call tact?

I swear you&#39;re as subtle as a brick in the small of my back

so let&#39;s end this call,

and end this conversation

there&#39;s nothing worse...

(that&#39;s right he said, that&#39;s right he said it)

I swear, you have no idea

The jealousy that became me thinking

(that&#39;s right he said)

that you always had it way too easy

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!
Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!

McGowen shuddered, and drifted off, nude except for sheets, naked and 
lonely.

She rode out the weekend in discomfort, in her hotel room. Andeira had 
packed up by Sunday night and sent Emma an unemotional phone call saying 
she could come back&#151;and that was all. She returned home in the middle of 
the night, and showered, and undressed, and once again held onto 
memories, for they alone comforted her during those cold hours.</pre>
