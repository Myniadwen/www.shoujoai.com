<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Amber and Sarah lingered behind Jessica and Caitlin as Sophia led them 
out of the train station. 

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Sarah whispered to her sister, &quot;Do you believe this 
stuff about Jessica being found nearly dead by this woman?&quot; 

Amber shook her head, unsure what to think, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to 
believe anymore, but I do know we are not going to stay here for long.&quot; 
She stated firmly, &quot;We are going to find our sisters and get us all out 
of here.&quot; 

&quot;How are we going to do that?&quot; Sarah inquired worriedly, &quot;We have left 
reality back there and what if the others don&#39;t want to leave?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; Amber stated in a low growl, keeping her eyes on the 
back of Sophia&#39;s head, &quot;There is something strange about that woman and 
I don&#39;t trust her.&quot; 

Sarah crossed her arms, &quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone.&quot; She stated bluntly. 

&quot;That&#39;s not true.&quot; Amber corrected the girl, &quot;I trust you.&quot; 

&quot;Well, that&#39;s good.&quot; Sarah lightly chuckled, &quot;Don&#39;t you think we should 
give this place half a chance. I mean what are we going to do if we 
escape? We can&#39;t bring five girls home with us.&quot; 

&quot;Five?&quot; Amber inquired curiously, &quot;Who is the others?&quot; 

&quot;Jessica, Caitlin, April, Penny and Kimberly?&quot; Sarah counted on her 
fingers, trying to think of anyone she had forgotten, &quot;Or had you not 
considered Kimberly? She of our sisters as well isn&#39;t she?&quot; 

Amber thought to herself, a hand upon her chin, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking 
about that. Could Kimberly have entered our dreams just to lure us 
here?&quot; 

Sarah blinked at the girl in confusion, &quot;Why would she do something like 
that? Don&#39;t you remember what happened to her? Or how close Penny was to 
her?&quot; 

Amber let out a tired sigh, &quot;I don&#39;t know... This is just too much to 
believe at the moment.&quot; 

&quot;We just ask for you to give us a chance.&quot; Sophia suddenly said, not 
turning around, &quot;And no, Kimberly was not sent to retrieve you, she 
entered your dreams of her own will.&quot; 

Amber started and rubbed her head in embarrassment, &quot;You could hear us?&quot; 

Sophia turned to face the girls as she arrived at the front doors to the 
station and smiled warmly, &quot;I know a lot more then you think.&quot; She 
explained simply as she held the doors open for the girls. 

Amber stopped just before exiting and stared up at the Head Mistress, 
&quot;How do I know you are telling the truth? It&#39;s hard to believe that 
someone would build a school just for kids like us?&quot; 

Sophia lightly set a hand upon the girl&#39;s head and lightly stroked her 
hair, &quot;I can understand your suspicions, but I can guarantee you that we 
have no intent to harm, or use, you. We just wish to give you a place to 
heal and prepare for the world a head of you.&quot; She said sincerely.

&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Sarah inquired curiously, &quot;What can you 
teach us that we can&#39;t learn at any other school.&quot; 

Sophia continued to look at Amber, &quot;How about how to control that dream 
power of yours?&quot; She explained, &quot;How would you like to stop those 
nightmares from controlling your life?&quot; 

Amber stared at the woman aghast; &quot;You can help me with that?&quot; She 
glanced at Sarah and back to the woman, &quot;Can you help me save my sisters 
from their nightmares too?&quot;

Sophia stroked the girl&#39;s head once more, &quot;You are a powerful Dream 
Walker and it is possible for you to banish all the darkness in all your 
sister&#39;s hearts if you learn how to.&quot; 

Amber&#39;s face brightened, &quot;How? Tell me?&quot; She demanded. 

Jessica laughed, &quot;Its not that easy.&quot; She stated with a chuckle then 
looked up at Sophia, &quot;Wait a moment! Dream studies? Are they coming to 
the Western Dorms?&quot; 

Sophia nodded, &quot;Yes they are. Is there a problem?&quot; 

Jessica ran a hand through her short hair, &quot;There might be. We are 
pretty full up and may have to play some musical chairs if these three 
want to room together.&quot; She glanced at the three girls, &quot;I&#39;m guessing 
you two want to be roomed together don&#39;t you?&quot; She asked looking between 
Amber and Sarah.

Amber and Sarah nodded vigorously. 

Caitlin tugged on Jessica&#39;s sleeve and the girl turned to face her, &quot;You 
too hmmm...&quot; She let out a sigh, I don&#39;t know if we have a room large 
enough for three beds.&quot; 

Sophia thought for a moment, &quot;We will think of something, those corner 
rooms are rather large for one person and I think the East Wing has a 
few extra beds that we can borrow. It might be a tight squeeze, but we 
will manage.&quot; 

Jessica turned and started down the stairs, &quot;I hope no one else shows up 
anytime soon or we&#39;ll end up with girl&#39;s sleeping on the floor in the 
main lobby the way we are going.&quot; 

Sophia stepped through the door after Amber and Sarah then gazed up at 
the dark sky and frowned as circling clouds as they blanketed the sky, 
several flashes of sheet lightening lighting up several patches of the 
sky, &quot;We had better hurry, it looks like rain.&quot;
