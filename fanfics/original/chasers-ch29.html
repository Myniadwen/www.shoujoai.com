<a href="../original/chasers-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>        Kate growled low in her throat as the cruiser slid to a stop, 
the line of human&#39;s and androids blocking their access to the buildings 
up ahead of them. She popped open the door, ignoring Jen&#39;s attempt to 
stop her as she stood up beside the cruiser.

        Kate took off her sunglasses, giving the crowd a withering look 
as she asked, &quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re not letting you go in there to kill the android,&quot; the 
blonde said, her eyes flashing with restrained anger.

        &quot;And you are?&quot; Kate asked, the rangy officer dressed in T-shirt 
and jeans, her only official clothing the battered police jacket she 
wore.

        &quot;Bette,&quot; the blonde said, blue eyes narrowing. &quot;Why, are you 
going to add my name to some list to be arrested later?&quot; she demanded.

        &quot;Just being friendly,&quot; Kate said with a slight smile.

        &quot;Ladies and gentlemen,&quot; Jen stood beside the cruiser, all eyes 
falling on the neatly dressed blonde officer, &quot;we&#39;re just here to 
perform our duties, nothing more.&quot;

        &quot;Saying you&#39;re just following orders didn&#39;t save the SS,&quot; a 
heckler yelled from the group of protesters and Jen blinked in 
confusion, clearly not getting the historical reference.

        &quot;We&#39;re not Nazis,&quot; Kate said, obviously getting it. &quot;We&#39;re 
police officers, sent here to stop a individual who may be harming more 
innocent people while we debate,&quot; she said.

        Bette tilted her head to the side and asked, &quot;You&#39;re only here 
to stop it from hurting people?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not promising that I won&#39;t shoot it,&quot; Kate said simply, 
&quot;because that might be what I need to do to stop it. But my job is to 
stop lawbreakers, not hurt innocents.&quot;

        The protesters held their line, staring at them with grave eyes. 
Jen moved quickly, taking her safety off, putting a bullet in the 
chamber and then firing up into the underside of a overhead roadway. The 
shot jerked the people back, the loudness startling them all.

        &quot;Lets go,&quot; Jen jumped into the car, Kate seconds behind her.

        &quot;I was getting through to them,&quot; Kate said with a frown, using 
the protesters surprise to weave the cruiser through them, nudging the 
slower ones aside as gently as possible.

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Jen agreed as they drove into the complex of 
structures, &quot;but how long could we spend debating? We still don&#39;t know 
what&#39;s going on inside there.&quot;

        &quot;Point,&quot; Kate agreed grimly.

        The emergency call had been broken off, just providing the 
location and one word: murder. Jen and Kate had rushed here as Beth and 
Gwen tried to reestablish communications with the research facility, but 
so far they had heard nothing more from inside.

        &quot;Beth,&quot; Jen used the cruiser&#39;s terminal to call in, &quot;any news?&quot;

        The little redhead&#39;s face appeared on the screen, a frown of 
concentration on Beth&#39;s face. &quot;Nothing yet,&quot; she said, &quot;and Gwen&#39;s got 
some worse news.&quot;

        Section Chief Gwen Musashi had a oddly grim look on her face. 
&quot;They appear to have been researching androids there,&quot; the Asian woman 
said seriously, &quot;including new design configurations and enhancements.&quot;

        Kate began to swear, loudly and creatively. &quot;Does that mean our 
guns won&#39;t work?&quot; she asked as they slid to a stop in front of the 
massive tower.

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Gwen said honestly. &quot;I&#39;m putting as much 
pressure on them as I can to get data on what they were working on,&quot; she 
said, &quot;but it&#39;s slow going.&quot;

        &quot;Do we have building schematics, that sort of thing?&quot; Jen asked.

        &quot;That I can do,&quot; Beth said as she came back on, &quot;and I&#39;ve 
patched into part of their internal systems. We can track your progress 
and guide you, hopefully.&quot;

        &quot;Hopefully?&quot; Kate raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;The security systems are using anti-invasion programs,&quot; Beth 
said, &quot;I think I can stay ahead of them, but this place has top of the 
line security.&quot;

        &quot;Makes me wonder what they&#39;re hiding in there,&quot; Jen murmured.

        &quot;Guess we&#39;ve got to find out,&quot; Kate sighed. She pulled an 
earpiece from a compartment in the car, clipping it into place as Jen 
did the same. &quot;All right,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;re heading inside.&quot;

        The front entrance was beautifully decorated, live plants 
scattered about. A receptionist sat behind the desk, her nearly perfect 
appearance marking her as an android. &quot;Welcome,&quot; she smiled at them 
cheerfully, &quot;welcome to Nutech.&quot;

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Jen smiled wryly, scanning the room.

        Kate had the oddest look on her face as she looked at the 
android. &quot;Hold on a second,&quot; she said, walking towards her. &quot;Oh hell,&quot; 
she muttered, once she got close enough.

        &quot;What?&quot; Jen asked, walking over.

        &quot;Could you please reattach my arms?&quot; the android asked 
cheerfully, the sleeves of her dress handing empty from her shoulders.

        &quot;Who did...?&quot; Kate asked.

        The android shook her head, &quot;Unknown. I was attacked from 
behind, I didn&#39;t see the unit that removed them.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll have someone take care of you,&quot; Jen offered, her face 
pale.

        &quot;Come on,&quot; Kate said crisply, leading Jen by the android as they 
headed for the hallway just behind her.

        &quot;Have a nice day,&quot; the android called out her programmed 
farewell.

        Kate activated the communicator, &quot;Beth, you guys have any more 
details on this place?&quot;

        Beth&#39;s voice came through loud and clear, &quot;According to publicly 
available information Nutech is developing second or third generation 
android technology.&quot;

        &quot;We just found an android with it&#39;s arms ripped off,&quot; Jen said 
harshly, &quot;this thing is strong.&quot;

        &quot;Crap,&quot; Beth muttered.

        &quot;That was pretty much my reaction,&quot; Kate agreed, moving down the 
plushly carpeted hallway cautiously. She held her gun at the ready as 
she asked, &quot;Can the security system give you life signs of anyone left 
in here?&quot;

        &quot;Accessing data,&quot; Beth replied, then there was a moment&#39;s pause. 
&quot;I&#39;m picking up android and human lifesigns three levels down, according 
to their files it&#39;s the research labs,&quot; she said.

        &quot;Fading lifesigns or steady?&quot; Jen asked quickly.

        &quot;Steady,&quot; Beth replied.

        &quot;Then we&#39;d better get down there before that changes,&quot; Kate said 
seriously. Beth gave them the location of the nearest lift and the two 
of them were off.

        **********

        Beth noticed that Gwen was standing nearby her workstation, the 
Section Chief looking down with a frown on her beautiful face. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot; she asked her softly.

        &quot;The representative of Nutech was just giving me a briefing on 
what we might be facing,&quot; Gwen said grimly, &quot;but from what they just 
said I suspect he wasn&#39;t being entirely candid with me.&quot;

        &quot;So what are you going to do?&quot; Beth asked, fingers flying across 
her keyboard as she fought against the security system she was hacking.

        &quot;Get the information,&quot; Gwen flashed an entirely humorless smile. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; and with that Gwen left the computer center.

        The representative for Nutech was getting a coffee as Gwen 
entered, the middle management type looking up to see her come in. The 
black haired man smiled cheerfully, &quot;How are things going?&quot;

        &quot;Mr. Alexander,&quot; Gwen walked right up to him as she said coldly, 
&quot;they found your receptionist with her arms torn off. What are we 
dealing with, here?&quot;

        Mr. Alexander winced slightly. &quot;I&#39;ve already put a request in 
with my superiors to release that information,&quot; he said mildly, &quot;I 
should be able to tell you once they reply.&quot;

        &quot;And how long will that be?&quot; Gwen raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;We&#39;ll need to contact head office,&quot; Mr. Alexander sounded just 
a bit sheepish, &quot;it&#39;ll take a few hours, at least.&quot;

        Gwen closed her hand into a fist. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but we don&#39;t have 
that kind of time,&quot; she said regretfully. Before he could move she 
slammed the fist right into his face, hearing the satisfying sound of 
his nose breaking.

        &quot;You can&#39;t....&quot; Mr. Alexander grabbed at his bloody nose, &quot;How 
dare you?!&quot;

        Gwen closed the distance, grabbing him by the collar and yanking 
him forward. &quot;You said this was a simple research facility,&quot; she said, 
&quot;I don&#39;t like being lied to.&quot; She punched him in the gut, doubling him 
over.

        &quot;When I inform your superiors...&quot; he choked out.

        &quot;My superiors aren&#39;t here right now,&quot; Gwen said bleakly, &quot;you 
are. I hate being lied to, but punching you is making me feel so much 
better. I&#39;ll just have to keep doing it unless you&#39;d care to tell me 
what&#39;s going on....&quot;

        Gwen raised her hand and Mr. Alexander blurted, &quot;No!&quot; He took a 
breath, &quot;Military models are prohibited in the city, but we weren&#39;t 
working on that.&quot;

        &quot;So what is it?&quot; Gwen growled.

        &quot;A recon model,&quot; Mr. Alexander said, &quot;designed to go behind 
enemy lines and gather data. It&#39;s got enhanced strength, tactical 
programming, and chameleon technology.&quot;
