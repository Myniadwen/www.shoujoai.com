<a href="../original/chasers-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>Gwen slid the car into the flow of traffic to the
city&#39;s recreation district, the elegant Asian woman
smiling to herself wryly. Beth&#39;s casual flash of skin
had unsettled her a bit, and if she was honest, had
excited her as well.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you wore your suit tonight,&quot; Beth commented
softly as they drove through the high class upper
levels, &quot;you look good in them.&quot;

Gwen felt warm, glad that she didn&#39;t blush easily.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; she softly answered as she smoothly
cruised up a ramp, &quot;though I always thought I looked
scary.&quot;

Beth actually smirked, &quot;I think that&#39;s part of your
charm.&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll just leave that alone,&quot; Gwen remarked.

The soft chuckle that came from the passenger seat of
the little sports car was gentle as Beth said,
&quot;Actually, I think it&#39;s part of your charm.&quot;

There was a soft beep from the car&#39;s map-screen then
the artificial intelligence softly said, &quot;Nearing
destination, Ms. Harris.&quot;

&quot;Do you have the access pass for your reservation?&quot;
Gwen asked as they neared the gate to the high level
building.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Beth smiled and produced a wafer thin
clear card with a holographic rose on it, passing it
over to Gwen.

Smoothly Gwen passed it over the scanner, the
barricade raising to let them in even as the voice
said, &quot;Beth Harris and Gwen Musashi, priority A
reservations.&quot;

&quot;High security here,&quot; Gwen noted as they slid into a
lift, the car being carried up even farther before
autodrive systems parked them in a spot.

Beth surprised Gwen a bit by getting out first and
going around to open up Gwen&#39;s door. She smirked at
Gwen&#39;s reaction, &quot;Well, I was the one who invited you
out.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen conceded.

&quot;All the security makes sense,&quot; Beth commented as they
walked away from the car over to the doors together,
the smaller woman holding onto Gwen&#39;s arm,
&quot;considering the wealth of some of the people who eat
here.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Gwen conceded. She looked down at Beth
thoughtfully as she said, &quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to know
how you got reservations here.&quot;

&quot;Easy as pie,&quot; Beth purred, &quot;I hacked them.&quot; As Gwen
gave her a startled look Beth chuckled, &quot;I&#39;m doing
some computer security work on the side, and the Rose
has been suffering some incursions recently. I helped
upgrade their defenses in exchange for cash upfront
and tonight.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t scare me like that,&quot; Gwen murmured to
her as they entered a beautifully decorated entrance
way.

&quot;Welcome Ms. Harris,&quot; the green haired android at the
door smiled, taking in Gwen and her computer brain
quickly looking up a file, &quot;and Ms. Musashi, I hope
that you&#39;ll enjoy your meal tonight.&quot; She gestured,
&quot;She will escort you to your table.&quot;

&quot;Please follow me,&quot; the pink haired android bowed
slightly, turning to lead them into the restaurant
itself.

Designed after a building from more than two hundred
years old, it held a regal sort of charm that was
almost intimidating. Wood paneling, soft carpets and
hanging lights made it feel like another world, the
layout helping minimize the sounds of other guests.

The round table was lit from above, two chairs waiting
in the corner by the window. Beth and Gwen each took
their seats, the pink haired woman smiling down at
them warmly as she pulled a simple notepad from a
pocket in her uniform skirt. &quot;You have a meal plan on
file, Ms. Harris,&quot; she said brightly, &quot;do you want to
make any changes?&quot;

&quot;It should be fine as it stands,&quot; Beth smiled back at
her automatically, &quot;could you deliver the first course
after we&#39;ve had a drink?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the waitress agreed, &quot;what are your
preferences?&quot;

&quot;Sake, if you please,&quot; Gwen said at Beth&#39;s silent
prompting.

&quot;Some wine,&quot; Beth finished and the android slid away
silently, only to return a moment later with a chilled
glass for Beth and a warmed container and saucer for
Gwen.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Gwen murmured softly once the android
was gone, looking out a moment at the stars and the
tops of the giant towers that made up the city.

Beth flashed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad, I wanted us to do
something that was new to you.&quot; She reached out to
carefully pour Gwen&#39;s first drink for her, &quot;Not easy,
considering what little I&#39;ve been able to find out
about you.&quot;

&quot;And what was that?&quot; Gwen asked her a little warily,
knowing what sort of things that Beth could do with
computers.

Beth gave her a scolding look, &quot;I kept it legal, only
a surface check.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Gwen gave her a smile.

&quot;S&#39;allright,&quot; Beth admitted, &quot;I&#39;m still a bit
sensitive about that, I guess.&quot; She waited until the
waitress delivered the first course before continuing
to speak, &quot;But I do think I put together a good
overview of your public life.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Gwen took a bite of the pasta, savoring the
spicy flavor.

&quot;Raised by your moderately successful family, shipped
off to private academy for college and then
university,&quot; Beth recited the facts from memory, &quot;but
when you were of legal age you joined the United
Nations Armed Forces for the standard two year tour.
After that you went into the Japan Self Defense
forces, though I don&#39;t know the exact time you left,
and I suspect that was the first time you had to fight
androids.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to confirm that,&quot; Gwen said, feeling
just a bit impressed. She didn&#39;t even think the
department knew that much.

&quot;You went into the police academy about seven years
ago and ran the accelerated course, finishing in only
a few months,&quot; Beth said. She smiled, &quot;It wasn&#39;t that
long after we began to run into each other, on the job
so to speak.&quot;

&quot;It was one of my toughest cases when I was
transferred to the electronic crimes department,&quot; Gwen
remembered fondly.

Beth leaned forward, meeting Gwen&#39;s eyes frankly as
she softly said, &quot;Personally, I&#39;m glad that I met
you.&quot;

A waitress brought the next dish, the vat-grown steaks
smelling wonderful. Gwen waited until she was far
enough away to ask Beth, &quot;Why did you give up so
easily, back then? I really didn&#39;t have all that much
evidence against you.&quot;

Beth pretended to look shocked, &quot;No!&quot;

Gwen gave her a look, &quot;Seriously, why?&quot;

Beth cut her steak, chewing on the piece to give her a
few moments to decide how best to reply. &quot;I looked
into your eyes that day,&quot; she finally said, &quot;in that
dinky little office you were working out of then, and
I realized something. You weren&#39;t going to give up,
you&#39;d keep going after me until you did busted me.&quot;

It was odd, of the compliments she had been given over
the years, this one hit Gwen the most. She actually
blushed, managing to say, &quot;I wasn&#39;t that bad.&quot;

Beth looked at her warmly, &quot;You aren&#39;t the type to
give up until you&#39;ve gotten what you want.&quot; She
paused, &quot;A lot like I am.&quot;

Gwen almost knew she shouldn&#39;t ask, but as she
finished a bite she just had to do it. &quot;And what do
you want?&quot; her voice was quiet in the room.

Beth reached out, gently laying her hand on Gwen&#39;s.
&quot;You,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;I thought you were the party girl,&quot; Gwen felt her
defenses going up automatically, &quot;with dates lined up
around the corner.&quot;

&quot;I guess I deserved that,&quot; Beth winced, pulling back
her hand.

Gwen reached out, grasping it and giving a gentle
squeeze, &quot;No you didn&#39;t, that was a cheap shot.&quot; A
breath, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Beth smiled back tentatively, &quot;You take what you can
get, especially if you know you can&#39;t get what you
want.&quot; She looked a little sheepish and continued,
&quot;And to be honest, I was scared stiff about asking you
out, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve done my best to maintain my distance,&quot; Gwen
conceded. She studied Beth a moment, &quot;I&#39;m not ready to
leap into a relationship, especially considering my
track record, but I would like to go out with you
again.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Beth smiled happily.

&quot;No promises,&quot; Gwen quickly cautioned her, &quot;but I&#39;d
like to try.&quot;</pre>
