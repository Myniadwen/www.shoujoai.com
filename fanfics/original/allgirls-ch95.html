<h1>All Girls School (part 95 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch94.html">Back to Part 94</a><pre>&quot;Spring Break&#151;The Vacation&quot;

Kathlyn didn&#39;t think she&#39;d get away with it. A whole week spent abroad 
with the woman she loved, just the two of them set against the backdrop 
of a springtime Finland&#151;it sounded incredulous. Her present caretaker 
surely wouldn&#39;t allow it&#151;after all, she had forbade Kathlyn to live with 
Leena any more until she graduated, so why would she ever give her a 
week&#39;s worth of privacy and free time? Of course, all this sour thinking 
only made Katt&#39;s heart jump higher when Bernadette said yes, and she 
gave the older woman such a tight hug that even her toughened body felt 
crushed. Parkin was actually packed and ready to go in a manner of 
hours, easily fitting her entire life in just two large suitcases. 
Bernadette couldn&#39;t help but smile as she watched the young lady wait in 
anticipation.

Leena had offered to take Parkin with her on her annual vacation to her 
home country sometime around the Christmas season, and she agreed 
without hesitation. She had three months to come up with a way to 
convince Miss Marbel to let her go, and hearing her Headmistress give 
her permission was possibly one of the happiest moments in Katt&#39;s life. 
A whole week together with dear Leena, where they could do as they 
pleased without work or school getting in the way! It actually made 
Kathlyn short of breath (more so than usual), and she had to calm 
herself down with her inhaler.

One day, she swore, I&#39;ll free myself from this thing once and for all.

She took it with her too; Leena had a way of making her breathless.

The love-struck girl literally jumped when she heard the doorbell ring 
and bolted so quickly that even Blake would&#39;ve been impressed. 
Bernadette wisely distanced herself from the area, not wanting to 
distract the two lovebirds with her overbearing presence. No doubt Leena 
would feel a little guilty if she saw her boss standing there, watching 
her temporary &quot;daughter&quot; be taken off by a handsome suitor on a date. 
They would most likely want to hug and kiss a little as well, so 
Bernie&#39;s absence was also due to her consideration. Besides, how could 
she say no? Despite their age difference and their academic 
relationship, Katt and Leena looked too perfect together to oppose.

Since Leena didn&#39;t want to pay for long-term parking, she had gotten an 
understanding friend to escort them to the airport. Kathlyn smiled at 
Miss Cerio and waved; the three were on the road quickly, sharing sparse 
conversation the whole time. Spring was just starting to wake the world 
up, although the thermometers argued different. Kathlyn had worn a 
jacket and packed a coat, but Leena swore Finland would be the perfect 
temperature, in spite of its relative proximity to the North Pole. She 
said the coastal lowlands were particularly fertile, and the beaches 
were not to be missed.

&quot;When we get on the plane, I&#39;ll give you a little book that should 
explain everything,&quot; she said.

&quot;What about language? I don&#39;t speak Finnish or Swedish.&quot;

&quot;Ah, you&#39;ll have me around!&quot; she exclaimed, giving her girlfriend a 
nudge. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t leave you in the dark. I will be happy to 
interpret!&quot;

&quot;She certainly is gifted in foreign tongues,&quot; added Abi rather saucily. 
&quot;Why, when we were seeing each other, she always had the cutest way of 
pronouncing things...&quot;

&quot;Oh, hush!&quot; snapped Leena, slapping the driver&#39;s arm. Abi laughed and 
kept her focus; Katt turned a little pale. She knew of Leena&#39;s brief 
romantic relationship with the math teacher, and still wondered to that 
day why the two had broken up. Abi was so much prettier, smarter, and 
more sophisticated than she was, plus she was open and honest, and gay 
in the purest sense (she also was attracted to women). Leena noticed her 
condition and looked serious.

&quot;You okay, hon?&quot;

&quot;Uh, y-yeah, just a little nervous. I&#39;ve never been on a plane before.&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t?&quot; Leena grinned wildly and gave her girlfriend a passionate 
stare. &quot;Oh, sweetheart...you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. When that 
big hunk of metal flies off the ground and soars into the sky...whew! 
There&#39;s nothing that compares. Of course,&quot; she said directly to Abi, 
&quot;our wild nights of sexual promiscuity are a definite exception.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hush!&quot; snapped the driver, slapping Leena&#39;s hand. Leena laughed and 
gave Katt a wink; she blushed heavily and smiled.

Abi embraced them both when she dropped them off at the airport, telling 
them to be careful and behave themselves. Leena said they&#39;d take care, 
but as for their behavior... Cerio laughed and wished them a wonderful 
time, then scurried off to her next destination, the cruise she and the 
other teachers were taking. Now that they were alone, Katt and Leena 
looked at each other, smiled, and held hands. Going through the airport 
terminal was a long, mostly quiet affair, one that involved plenty of 
paperwork and quiet anticipation. Their luggage was placed on a conveyor 
and taken to the plane; their small carry-on bags they held onto, both 
of them containing a snack, something to read, and a secondary 
distraction.

The two women wound their way to their gate and waited for their plane 
to board. Kathlyn had been called aside randomly for a thorough 
screening, and stood still and compliant as the security guards checked 
her everywhere. Her belt went off, and so did her inhaler, but otherwise 
she was cleared, although a little stirred from the trouble. Of course 
she knew it was standard procedure, and couldn&#39;t blame airport security 
for being cautious. After the events of a certain day in September, 
everyone was a little more careful.

Kathlyn knew she was lucky for sharing a seat with her beloved. Somehow 
they had beaten the odds (or else they were seated together 
deliberately) and managed to share a space; Leena even gave Katt the 
window seat, even though she wasn&#39;t really supposed to do that. Oh well. 
For a long time the plane did nothing, even after the passengers had 
boarded. Kathlyn cracked open her book and read restlessly until, an 
hour later it seemed, the vehicle finally lurched to a start.

&quot;About five more minutes,&quot; said Leena, squeezing her hand. Kathlyn 
looked out the window and saw little but the runway moving gradually. 
The plane was getting ready to take off, but it took longer than she 
thought it would. At last the great mechanical bird sped up to an 
unbelievable degree, faster than anything Katt had felt before, and 
then...

WHOOM!!!

There was no other way to describe the thrill of a heavy mechanical body 
rising into the atmosphere, except through an awesome silence. Kathlyn 
felt like she was going into space, and hummed to herself &quot;Thus Spoke 
Zarathustra&quot;, the only thing she could equate to the majesty of liftoff. 
Leena was much more casual about it, having done this several times 
before, so she was content to leave Kathlyn alone in the thrilling shock 
of it all. At last her girlfriend snapped out of it, stared at Leena 
with eyes wide open, and breathed out an exclamation.

&quot;That was incredible!!&quot;

&quot;Told ya,&quot; she grinned.

.........

Kathlyn didn&#39;t much like the landing (way too bumpy), and having her 
ears pop several times as the plane flew in and out of turbulence was 
something she didn&#39;t want to repeat again. But at last they had arrived, 
taking their time across the Atlantic and Western Europe, finally here 
in Finland, only a few hours left in the day. It was already dark by the 
time Katt and Leena got off the plane and into the airport. They had 
eaten en route, but Kathlyn was hungry again and Leena wasn&#39;t stopping 
for snacks. Rather, she plucked her cell phone from her purse and was 
soon speaking into it, slipping completely into her native language. 
Katt was left out to dry.

Finland was not quite as cold as she feared, probably because they were 
in the lower part of the country and it was spring, but it was still 
chilly enough for her to huddle inside her jacket and seek the warmth of 
Leena&#39;s side (who, by the way, was unfazed by the cold). The older woman 
was on the phone for awhile before she hung up and returned to using a 
language Kathlyn actually understood.

&quot;It won&#39;t be long now. We&#39;ll be home soon.&quot;

&quot;Oh? I&#39;ll get to see your parents?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I called my mother and told her we had arrived. I called her 
earlier while you were sleeping and told her when we&#39;d be here.&quot;

&quot;I slept? I could barely keep my eyes closed. It was so noisy on that 
plane.&quot;

&quot;I know, but you slept anyway, if only for a few seconds. I dozed off 
too.&quot; A break in the conversation. Kathlyn shyly reached out to take her 
teacher&#39;s hand, and Leena smiled as it squeezed over her fingers. She 
was clearly a little worried about being seen &quot;together&quot;, even though 
nobody save Leena&#39;s mother and father would even know about them. Back 
in the States they had to be careful; would the same care have to be 
taken here?

&quot;Leena,&quot; spoke the younger girl very shyly. Leena could see Parkins&#39; 
concern and leaned in to give her cheek a kiss.

&quot;Yes, dear?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;re your parents like? I mean, you told me they were okay with your 
being gay and all, but...um...I mean, will they accept me?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why not.&quot;

&quot;But, I mean, I&#39;m a whole lot younger than you are. Won&#39;t they think 
you&#39;re just spending time with a...kid?&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t have a problem with it,&quot; Leena assured her. &quot;And actually I 
told them all about the two of us earlier. I mean, they are expecting me 
to visit them with my new girlfriend in tow. And don&#39;t worry about our 
age difference. For the last time, Katt, please don&#39;t worry about that. 
I&#39;ve had flings with women much further spaced out in age than you.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Like what? What was the biggest difference?&quot; Leena made a sad face 
that was trying to be happy, or maybe the other way around, and slipped 
her hand out of Kathlyn&#39;s grip and into her pockets.

&quot;Twenty years,&quot; she answered. Of course Kathlyn was alarmed; that was 
old enough to be her mother!

&quot;Twenty years?! Holy crap!&quot;

&quot;What can I say?&quot; said Leena, shrugging sadly. &quot;I was in love, stupid 
and blind and so young. She was forty-three, but she looked fifteen 
years younger. God, she was wonderful sometimes...but she ended up 
breaking my heart.&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot; Kathlyn couldn&#39;t help but feel jealous, even though many years 
had passed since those days, and Leena clearly had feelings for her now. 
&quot;But still, twenty years? How did you...&quot;

&quot;Oh, we were like reckless kids. But looking back, it was for the best 
that we ended things. I could have lived my whole life with 
Stephanie&#151;that was her name&#151;and not cared about the years, but...if I 
had, I would never have met the real love of my life, the 
third-time&#39;s-the-charm princess who swept me off my feet, blew me over, 
and picked me up before I could fall. Naturally I&#39;m referring to you.&quot; 
Kathlyn grinned and turned pretty red as Leena (she felt) exaggerated. 
They didn&#39;t say much else while they waited for Leena&#39;s mother to pick 
them up, except for a few things Kathlyn wanted to know about her 
girlfriend&#39;s family.

Anita Katajisto, Leena&#39;s mother, was a dreamy-faced, strong-looking 
fiftysomething Finnish woman with graying blonde hair and wrinkles so 
defining and carefree that they actually made her more lovely. Like her 
daughter (and husband), she spoke fluent English and smiled with delight 
as she got out to look at her daughter&#39;s new love. After a few seconds 
of toothy investigation, she walked over and gave Leena a bear hug, 
kissing her thrice before greeting Kathlyn. Feeling shy and unsure, Katt 
wanted to settle on a handshake, but got embraced and even kissed as 
well, once on each cheek and a little friendly peck right on her lips.

&quot;Beautiful!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Katajisto, looking Kathlyn right in her 
face. &quot;She is every bit as lovely as you say, Leena. But she&#39;s so thin! 
You&#39;ve not instructed her well?&quot;

&quot;Katt&#39;s...not the physical type, ma. She&#39;s got asthma.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s right, how dumb of me to forget. Well, she looks very 
lovely, and not nearly as young as you said. And such pretty eyes!&quot; 
Leena&#39;s mother smiled widely and couldn&#39;t help but stare at Kathlyn&#39;s 
icy blue eyes. This made Kathlyn very nervous, but if Leena was going to 
do something, she would&#39;ve already done it. Luckily the social hour 
continued on the road as Mrs. Katajisto drove the two ladies from the 
airport to her home, though much of the conversation was in Finnish. 
Poor Kathlyn felt like a fish out of water as the two women yammered on, 
and resigned herself to staring out the car window until somebody spoke 
directly to her.

&quot;How do you like Finland?&quot; asked Anita, her accent thicker than her 
daughter&#39;s. Kathlyn smiled shyly and answered.

&quot;It&#39;s a little cold, but really bright and clean. I don&#39;t really mind 
the chill; I guess it&#39;ll go away soon.&quot;

&quot;Chill? What chill? The weather&#39;s perfect outs&#151;oh, that&#39;s right, you&#39;re 
used to warmer climates. Sorry I forgot. Leena&#151;&quot; and then more words in 
Finnish. They exchanged thoughts until another query came up: &quot;Leena 
tells me she&#39;d like for you to move in with her when you graduate. Are 
you looking forward to this?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am. Um...are you, uh, okay with me being, you know, so young, 
and your daughter&#39;s student?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never questioned her judgment before. Leena has always seemed to 
love the right person, except for that one time. I&#39;m glad Steph&#39;s no 
longer in the picture. Did she tell you about Stephanie?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, and Hana as well, her friend.&quot;

&quot;Ah yes, Hana.&quot; Mrs. Katajisto sighed wistfully, her voice drooping as 
her face drooped. &quot;I thought they&#39;d stay together all their lives. I 
even had the poor girl calling me mother! I was about to plan their 
wedding when I got wind that they were breaking up.&quot;

&quot;Long-distance relationships aren&#39;t really that great,&quot; added Leena with 
a smile. &quot;We split ways because we were...splitting ways, literally. I 
had my teaching job and there was no way I could refuse, so I left poor 
Hana to find other lovers and she did the same to me. I stand by my 
choice now.&quot; She grinned and clearly winked at Kathlyn, even reaching 
over to touch her thigh. Kathlyn turned red, but didn&#39;t discourage the 
contact; in fact she held Leena&#39;s hand and kept their fingers entwined 
during the whole ride.

It was so dark and so late by the time they all arrived that Kathlyn and 
Leena only had time to eat before they settled in for bed. Leena&#39;s old 
house, now occupied solely by her parents, was a beautiful small 
two-story building nestled in a quiet neighborhood. Its interior was 
decorated with plenty of framed photographs, vases, lots of plants and 
enough lamps to ensure the darkness would never triumph. Leena&#39;s father 
was still at work, but by the time he would come, supper would be ready 
and so too would be their appetites.

Even though Kathlyn was an honored guest (she was told to make herself 
at home sixteen times throughout her stay), she volunteered to help 
cook. Dinner that evening would be small and practical, just enough to 
tide everyone over until breakfast, so it was not so much cooking as it 
was a good way to make hasty acquaintance with a certain girlfriend&#39;s 
mother. There is not many better ways to get to know someone than to 
cook with them, especially in a small kitchen. Mrs. Katajisto learned a 
few other things about her daughter&#39;s girlfriend, and tried her best to 
make her feel at home, smiling and listening as she spoke, even treating 
her like an adult and not a kid. By the time everything was ready, 
Kathlyn was more at ease, and prepared to meet her girlfriend&#39;s dad.

Mr. Leopold Katajisto was a tall man even compared to his tall daughter 
and tall wife. He was the kind of man who was rough and wild, but 
charming and loving to boot; he reminded Kathlyn of Ernest Hemingway. He 
looked like the sort of man who could wrestle bears and laugh, or walk a 
tightrope and whistle, or juggle knives and sing. He gave Kathlyn a bear 
hug that was almost painful, and kissed her hand instead of her face 
(although he did kiss Leena in the same manner her mother did). The two 
of them prayed over the meal&#151;Leena seemed to participate by closing her 
eyes and holding hands&#151;and dug in quietly, no television in sight. A 
normal person would&#39;ve found the silence deadening, but for Kathlyn, 
whose own house was filled with noise, it was as delicious as the meal.

After supper, Leena excused herself, kissed her parents again, and told 
them she was going to bed. Kathlyn was given the option of staying up 
late or sleeping, but in her heart she wanted to be with Leena. It had 
been so long since they shared the same bed! The feel of beautiful 
Leena&#39;s warm, gentle skin against her own, those needy lips, the gentle 
eyes, the seductive smile and the hair, everywhere, laughing and 
tickling and moaning so sweet...

&quot;Uh, sorry,&quot; she told them, falling back on a more practical excuse, 
&quot;but I&#39;m kinda tired and I have jet lag. Maybe tomorrow.&quot; Leena&#39;s 
parents understood and let her go. Kathlyn had no idea where her 
girlfriend&#39;s room was, but she knew it was on the second floor, so she 
waited until she saw a sign. One came to her quickly, from out of the 
bathroom, her hair all let down to its shaggy, yellowy, fluffy beauty, 
and she was quite breathtaking as well. Leena smiled at Kathlyn and 
invited her into her old room, a place not quite bare since the older 
woman used it annually. Once they were inside they shut the door, and 
Kathlyn stood stock still with her eyes bulging as the demi-goddess 
Leena Katajisto undressed.

She didn&#39;t go all the way, she just took everything off except her 
underwear and a T-shirt, but the mere sight of her standing there like 
that made Parkins&#39; heart pounce. She felt the overwhelming desire to 
take her beloved right there and then, ravishing her wildly as if she 
were a prisoner just now set free. Of course she didn&#39;t, she was 
paralyzed, but it was a near thing. Leena turned around and gave her 
sweetheart a penetrating smile.

&quot;Are you going to sleep in your clothes?&quot;

&quot;Um...no, uh...&quot;

&quot;Well, get undressed, silly! Come on, what&#39;re you worried about? We&#39;ve 
been naked together before.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but...it&#39;s been awhile.&quot; As she said this she took her clothes 
off, nearly everything except her underwear&#151;that included her shirts. 
Now clad in naught save a bra and panties, she gave her love a more 
confident smile, maybe trying to seduce her as she walked over and 
turned off the lights. Leena felt herself melt from watching this 
heavenly creature, and could barely utter her next words.

&quot;Yes...it has indeed been awhile.&quot;

.........

Kathlyn was happy to wake up in Leena&#39;s arms, even if they were in her 
old room. She ached to cuddle with the gentle, cute woman, but as soon 
as Leena noticed her, she rose out of bed. Katt groaned for her company 
and made a reaching gesture; Leena just smiled.

&quot;Oh, we can get cozy later, sweetheart. Right now I&#39;d like to spend time 
with my family. Come on, let&#39;s have some breakfast.&quot; Kathlyn forced 
herself out of bed, looking not quite so attractive anymore, and tumbled 
into Leena&#39;s grasp. Poor Leena laughed as she caught her girlfriend and 
rubbed her bare skin until some life came back. &quot;Listen,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;we&#39;ve got the whole week to spend together, and soon we&#39;ll have 
the rest of our lives. Believe me when I say I&#39;d like nothing more than 
an early morning make-out session, but it can wait. Besides, we can&#39;t 
have sex all week; we have to do something constructive. Erm, more so.&quot;

&quot;What do you have in mind?&quot; she said, looking up. Leena winced.

&quot;I think maybe we should brush our teeth. You&#39;ve got Angel Breath, but I 
must smell like an old crocodile.&quot; Kathlyn grinned and leaned up to kiss 
Leena briefly, saying there was nothing wrong with her scent. They went 
to the bathroom anyway, brushing their teeth and washing their faces. 
When they could kiss again, the result was much more pleasant. Kathlyn 
glared at Leena with aggressive passion as they embraced.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll take a shower,&quot; she purred; &quot;wanna join me?&quot;

&quot;I...I&#39;d love to.&quot;

&quot;Then what&#39;re you waiting for?&quot; Kathlyn deftly freed her beloved from 
the confines of the small white t-shirt, and in no time at all they were 
naked and underneath a spray of water, Leena the victim of a young 
woman&#39;s uncontrollable hormones. Kathlyn wanted her, now, and would have 
her no matter what&#151;not that Leena minded the sudden rise in her 
girlfriend&#39;s spunk!

During breakfast, Leena suggested that they all spend the day together, 
her parents and Kathlyn. Mom and dad liked the idea, but had to convince 
the young doubtful Miss Parkin that they did indeed want to be around 
her and to accept her. She was okay with the idea of being with them, 
it&#39;d just take time for the whole thing to sink in. She was afraid that 
her girlfriend&#39;s parents would somehow disapprove of her, one way or the 
other, but the Katajistos were so liberal that it took her of guard. 
When breakfast was over and everyone was dressed, Anita and Leopold 
asked Katt if she wanted to go anywhere.

&quot;This is my first time in a foreign country,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and except 
for visiting Helsinki and the beaches, I wouldn&#39;t know what&#39;s here.&quot; The 
two of them looked at each other and smiled, saying they would think of 
something nice. The morning was very bright and still a little chilly, 
but it wasn&#39;t unbearable, and Kathlyn barely needed a jacket. The 
foursome walked instead of drove, since Ma said it was good exercise and 
their destination wasn&#39;t far. They were headed to an art gallery.

On the way, Ma and Pa (as Kathlyn was encouraged to address them) told 
their daughter&#39;s &quot;sweet new girlfriend&quot; a lot about Finland, and about 
themselves. Finland had quite a system of lakes; they covered nine 
percent of the whole country and extended through the central Lakeland 
to create a system of labyrinths, some of which they would later visit. 
Most of the country was forest or swamps, but thirty percent was barren 
Artic tundra (this too they&#39;d visit, to see the nomadic Lapps herding 
reindeer). Later, Kathlyn would learn why Leena seemed smarter than she 
looked: Finland had high educational standards, and illiteracy was 
almost unheard of. Leena had attended one of the universities to study 
ballet and phys ed, but her true dream was cut a little short with the 
advent of her teaching career.

The art gallery was actually pretty cool. Kathlyn herself was a bit of 
an artist (as Mrs. Keys could attest), so she could appreciate the 
things she saw in there. More than once she had wanted to sneak off with 
Leena and neck in some private spot, but the older woman was right: 
they&#39;d have more time for that. Just being with her was enough; slight 
touches, whispers, and gentle stares gave every moment brief little 
jolts. The quartet had lunch in the gallery and then walked off to an 
outdoor concert they had bought tickets for. They all sat together on 
lawn chairs and were entertained for a few hours (Miss Parkin was too 
entranced to think of much else).

It became dark soon, and even though she knew it was going to happen, it 
still alarmed Katt. She was used to seeing the sun sink down later, even 
in the winter. Of course, Leena herself had been in the states long 
enough to almost forget, but she didn&#39;t want to embarrass herself and so 
said nothing. She huddled near her girlfriend and gave her a small 
(albeit public) kiss on her cheek, as if it was the most normal thing in 
the world. Imagine Kathlyn&#39;s surprise when nobody stood to gawk!

&quot;This isn&#39;t America, darling,&quot; Leena reminded her. &quot;We can get away with 
a little bit of public affection. Of course, we&#39;re not going to make out 
in the streets, but...&quot; Kathlyn giggled and kissed Leena back, then 
placed a quick, bold smooch on her lips.

&quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered needily. &quot;Can we hold hands?&quot;

&quot;S-sure,&quot; she stuttered, her face a little red. Whether her parents saw 
her was irrelevant; she wanted to take this angel&#39;s hand and keep it 
close. With the dark now almost complete, it was difficult to see, so 
the Katajisto family and their guest headed home. This time, vowed Ma, 
they would make a dinner worthy of their new guest.

Dinner was good, and since she had left early for selfish reasons, 
Kathlyn stayed up and chatted with Leena&#39;s parents, even when Leena 
herself left. What wonderful, hearty people they were! Leena clearly got 
her strength, good nature, and beauty from them both (Mr. Katajisto 
must&#39;ve been a heartbreaker in his youth), but her love of ballet came 
strictly from mother. Anita had been a ballet instructor for many years, 
and had performed for nearly as long. It was in a ballet where she met 
her husband&#151;

&quot;But that,&quot; she said, &quot;is a story for another night. I, for one, am 
tired. Leo, what about you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got some books to read,&quot; he said. The two touched hands and slowly 
slipped away, a sweet sign of affection to Kathlyn&#39;s eyes. She excused 
herself from &quot;Pa&quot; and went upstairs to join her beloved. When she got to 
her room, a...surprise was in store for her. Leena was completely nude 
and sprawled on her bed, breathing gently and waiting for the arrival of 
her dear-heart. Kathlyn stood petrified in the doorway as her lover, her 
teacher, her goddess in human form laid there, chest rising and falling 
hypnotically with each intake of breath.

&quot;Katt,&quot; whispered Leena huskily, &quot;hi. Come here, won&#39;t you? I need you 
so badly.&quot;

Of course, Miss Parkin was more than willing to comply.

.........

On the third day, Leena told her parents she wanted to spend the whole 
day just with her girlfriend. They understood and gave her free reign of 
the town, provided she &quot;come home before curfew&quot;. Giggles abounded, and 
so, after breakfast, the two lovebirds made their way outside. Leena had 
gone and done something rather sweet, and bought ballet tickets for the 
both of them. It was a production Katt had never heard of, nor could she 
even pronounce, but she was glad to go anyway and couldn&#39;t wait. They 
spent most of the morning shopping for appropriate dresses&#151;and oh what 
fun it was to have big, tough Leena try on so many pink, frilly, girlish 
dresses! Somehow she made them work, even with her size and mass. 
Perhaps that sweet smile of hers helped.

&quot;In two days we&#39;ll go up north,&quot; she said while they shopped. &quot;Mom and 
dad want to see the Lapps before it gets too warm, and I&#39;d like to take 
a chance with the Aurora Borealis.&quot;

&quot;You mean I could see the Northern Lights here?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we&#39;re just right about in one of the best areas for it. I&#39;m not 
gonna guarantee anything, because it&#39;s not like we can just turn them on 
and off at our will, but I...have a feeling we&#39;ll strike it rich.&quot; 
Kathlyn grinned and gave Leena a hug, one she was only too happy to 
return. They mostly walked around and talked for the rest of the day, 
Leena telling her sweetheart about her parents, wisely straying away 
from talk of her two past lovers. Even she could tell that Kathlyn was 
uncomfortable hearing about it, not that she had anything to worry 
about. Leena was hers, completely and absolutely, and there was nothing 
that would break them apart.

&quot;I do wish you&#39;d just accept it, honey,&quot; Leena said to her on the way 
home. &quot;I&#39;m free to choose who I love, and I choose you. Trust me, I love 
you with all my heart, and I&#39;m so happy we&#39;re together. Stop degrading 
yourself; you&#39;re a princess in my eyes.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said, grinning sheepishly. &quot;I guess I&#39;m just suspicious if 
something is too good to be true. And you are so very good to me...&quot; 
They both smiled and risked a kiss, not necessarily a good thing to do 
while driving. Luckily, only Leena&#39;s pride was damaged, though her ears 
could&#39;ve gone without all that honking...

When it came time to leave for the performance, Ma Katajito insisted on 
taking a picture of the lovely couple. The two &quot;lovebirds&quot; had already 
seen each other in their dresses&#151;Katt in a sleeveless ice-blue dress to 
match her eyes, Leena in a sexy red dress that knew what to show off and 
what to hide&#151;but Ma and Pa hadn&#39;t. When they both descended the stairs, 
they looked like great balls of ice and fire, and several photos were 
taken. The ballet itself was fairly dull, but it gave Kathlyn an excuse 
to sit next to a beautiful woman, one she loved so much, and hold her 
hand for two hours and more

.........

Day four was uneventful for a long time. The routine of breakfast, 
washing up, and lounging around in the morning air was beginning to 
become commonplace, and though Kathlyn liked sitting around doing 
nothing but reading and watching TV she couldn&#39;t understand, after 
awhile it got dull. Leena promised her they&#39;d go somewhere after lunch, 
but for now she wanted to take things easy and rest. Kathlyn finished 
her book quickly (in privacy, because her sweetheart would definitely be 
a distraction) and grew bored of TV, and so told Leena she&#39;d go out for 
a walk. Ma and Pa were at work, leaving the two of them alone, but what 
things they might&#39;ve done together in that time were best left to the 
imagination.

Leena made soup for them since she really couldn&#39;t cook anything else, 
and while they were eating she finally discussed what the plans were for 
that day. The two of them were finally going to the beach, but not just 
any beach, she said&#151;a nude beach. Kathlyn took the news fairly (by 
merely pausing and staring at Leena questionably), and stopped eating to 
really let it sink in. Leena knew she&#39;d react that way and smiled 
gently.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we won&#39;t be the only ones there naked.&quot;

&quot;I-I know, I&#39;m just...&quot;

&quot;Uncomfortable? You can relax, sweetie; you&#39;ve got nothing to be ashamed 
of. You&#39;ve definitely got nothing to be ashamed of.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but...&quot;

&quot;Earlier this morning you had a hard time keeping my clothes on, let 
alone yours,&quot; she commented. &quot;And now you say you&#39;re embarrassed? It&#39;s a 
nude beach, honey; you&#39;ll relax in no time once you see all those other 
bodies.&quot;

&quot;That is partially what is so concerning,&quot; said Katt with a dark blush. 
Leena laughed and reached out to reassure her.

&quot;Come on, it&#39;ll be fun and relaxing. You won&#39;t even notice it after 
awhile. C&#39;mon, I&#39;ll drive.&quot;

&quot;How do we...get there? I mean, not driving; I mean our clothes. Do we 
drive all the way there naked?&quot;

&quot;Of course not. You and I can take some bathrobes, or we can undress and 
keep our stuff in a locker. I&#39;ve been there before; it&#39;s a really nice 
place, and totally not sexual in any way.&quot; She had to say a few more 
things to convince Kathlyn to go, but had the most success with the &quot;Do 
you have anything better to do?&quot; line and the ole reliable, &quot;I&#39;ll bring 
the special suntan lotion with us.&quot; Even so, Kathlyn didn&#39;t want to go 
wearing just a robe, so they put on the bare amount of clothes possible, 
packed towels and other essentials, and were off in a quarter hour.

Having never been to a nude beach before (or for that matter, a beach 
period&#151;at least not one in many years), Kathlyn didn&#39;t know what to 
expect. Men and women wandering around, their genitals out for display, 
their hindquarters flashing shamelessly, lustful eyes wandering here and 
there, perversions everywhere? She braced herself for all this and more, 
but had to admit she also felt very adventurous. Nudity, even in her own 
room, was taking a more sensual position in her life now that she 
discovered her new sexuality, and being naked outside&#151;a simple childish 
fantasy&#151;especially with Leena, filled her veins with a thrilling rush. 
She held her beloved&#39;s hand until they got to the women&#39;s changing room 
(at least these were separated), and quickly, bravely, went about her 
duty.

Leena smiled without a bit of shame at Kathlyn as they turned to face 
each other again. Seeing one another by moonlight or starlight was one 
thing, but here out underneath the sun, amidst the general public 
(Finnish and open-minded though they were), was entirely different, as 
different as the nights and days themselves. Kathlyn was quite red by 
the time she trod out, naked hands clasping onto her lover&#39;s fingers, 
waddling without a thing on in the thick of the beach. It was scandalous 
and almost painful in its eroticism, and she couldn&#39;t help but blush, or 
wince, or make a face when another naked body swept past her. Everyone 
was probably older than her here, but they had the minds of adults and 
even artists, people who could appreciate being without &quot;restraints&quot;. 
She failed to take it all in before they found a spot to roost (and in 
fact never fully took it in, nor would she ever, no matter how long she 
stayed).

Leena Marjanna Katajisto never failed to be sexual, even if she didn&#39;t 
mean it. Kathlyn stared as her lover sprawled out on the bed of sand, 
nestled safely on a white towel, stretched until her breasts looked 
nearly flat, and let out a sigh of contentment. Her pubic hair, trimmed 
just a little, looked a few shades darker than the sand and Kathlyn 
found herself aching to do very unladylike things with it. She resisted 
and sat down next to her love, wondering if it was okay of her to start 
rubbing suntan oil all over that exquisite skin.

&quot;Oh, I almost forgot!&quot; Leena exclaimed, seeing the bottle. She smiled at 
her lover and said, &quot;Glad one of us has some sense. I better have some 
oil on me before I crackle up. Would you mind?&quot;

&quot;I would love to,&quot; said Katt in her most seductive voice. Of course, up 
until meeting Leena, she had been quite a shy, unpredictable, reserved 
person, certainly not one to dabble in romance or its relatives; but 
then again, love and kindness can do many things, especially if they 
come from a person who was, quite frankly, perfect for her. The oil was 
white and cold; Leena hissed and even let out a little moan as her 
lover&#39;s palms and fingers touched her skin, and might have even blacked 
out from time to time. If anybody had any objections to the two females 
attending to each other, they certainly didn&#39;t express them.

Kathlyn&#39;s turn came too soon for them both (time usually does rove along 
speedily in the process of sexual massage and other matters), and ended 
far too soon as well, even though it was safe to say that Leena took her 
time with the younger woman. They laid out under the sun for an hour, 
roasting their chests and bellies first, then flipped over to get their 
backsides and spines tan. They hardly spoke except to say a few words; 
it was one of those times, and places, and days that really didn&#39;t 
require a conversation. After their tan, they took a small walk and 
ended up wading together in the water. Katt was still surprised to find 
nobody groping anybody else, not even those who were together, and 
wondered if anything sexual ever happened at this place.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Leena said to her, &quot;but most likely at night, and not when 
there&#39;s many people around.&quot; She then made a promise to Katt to bring 
her to a &quot;regular&quot; beach on their last evening, so they could hold hands 
and walk the shores underneath star and moon, and perhaps go 
skinny-dipping in the cool air or even have outright sex right in the 
sand. It was something to look forward to, but for now they were both 
occupied with the brighter aspect of things. And soon, when they came to 
shore and dried off underneath the gay sun, Leena noticed something she 
never expected.

&quot;Oh my God!&quot; she yelled out happily. She stood up quickly, beaming the 
sun&#39;s rays out from her own face, and reached out to embrace (Kathlyn 
observed) a very beautiful, very naked woman. Her face turned red and 
her ears burned just by watching, and she stayed paralyzed as the two 
jabbered to each other in Finnish. This was clearly a friend of Leena&#39;s, 
possibly her best friend, her first lover called Hana (that name 
certainly came up a lot, so Katt merely deduced it). Hana, if that&#39;s who 
this was, also had a standoffish young woman as a companion, though her 
hair was long and way, something dark between brown and black. She 
watched her companion yak patiently, stealing glances at Kathlyn to 
share a knowing smile&#151;as if to say, &quot;Well, our friends have certainly 
forgotten about us.&quot; At last Leena addressed Kathlyn again, weaving in 
and out of Finnish with amazing skill

&quot;Katt,&quot; she said to her, &quot;this is my best friend, Hana Milovos. Hana&#151;&quot; 
and then more words in her native tongue. So, it was her ex-girlfriend! 
A pang of jealousy forced its way into Katt&#39;s lungs, and would not be 
expelled. Leena had harped about her relationship with Hana before, 
sometimes even forgetting that Katt was in the same room. She always 
declared herself freed from her ex-lover&#39;s binds, and now swore fealty 
to her, but still...

The only thing she could do was watch and feel left out. Leena explained 
that Hana couldn&#39;t understand or speak English, so she offered to 
translate. Katt really didn&#39;t want to socialize with the older woman, 
not even if she had her own girlfriend and was now just a friend of 
Leena&#39;s. She knew she was being foolish, but her young heart was frail 
and, perhaps, the closer you are to a person, the less space you desire 
to separate them from you. Hana was at least polite, and said how happy 
she was that Leena was in love with &quot;a proper woman&quot; this time (not 
sounding unlike Ma and Pa). She even expressed some modicum of jealousy, 
which didn&#39;t seem to upset her own companion (Katt didn&#39;t learn her 
name, but was informed that the two were indeed a couple).

Leena openly kissed Hana on the mouth, but it was a friendly peck and 
not the lover&#39;s embrace Katt was used to receiving. They separated after 
that, each one promising to keep in touch and wishing the other good 
luck with their girlfriends. Leena had a refreshing smile on her mouth 
when she returned to her girlfriend&#39;s side, but knew that her 
inattentiveness was going to cost her. With a sigh, she knelt down and 
caressed the gentle hands of her lover.

&quot;I know, I know. But it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve seen her. I knew she had 
a girlfriend, I just never saw her or met her. And she looks fantastic; 
they both do. The years have been kind to them.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m being a pain in the ass, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Kathlyn said; &quot;What with all 
this jealousy. I know I shouldn&#39;t, I just... God, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be.&quot; Leena drew her in and kissed her forehead. &quot;That stuff 
between us...happened a long time ago, when I was younger than you. 
We&#39;ve been apart for about eight or nine years now, and I don&#39;t plan on 
looking back. She seems quite happy now with that lover of hers, and I, 
of course, am like a clam.&quot; Kathlyn smiled shyly and kissed Leena, then 
decided to do something very sweet and looked her right in the eye.

&quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered, &quot;so deeply, Leena. And I will try hard not 
to be jealous the next time.&quot;

.........

The pillow talk they had that night, and later that morning, was sweet 
but personal and private, meant only for them to hear. Since it was 
nearly the end of Spring Break, and they would be forced to return to 
their normal lives soon, Kathlyn and Leena wanted to take their time 
with the fifth day&#151;which means they had quite a hard time getting out of 
bed! Most of that day was spent driving north to the tundra, where 
groups of reindeer, mostly wild, wandered the vast frozen plains with 
only natives to herd them. The family went further north after lunchtime 
and was able to make it pretty far up by the time night came. As 
promised, Leena and Katt cuddled together in the frost, watching the 
clear night sky for signs of celestial fireworks. Their efforts were not 
put to waste; the Northern Lights came and did not disappoint. By the 
time everyone came home again, it was so late it was almost morning.

The final day was spent packing and preparing for the plane ride home, 
even though it wasn&#39;t leaving until the next day. Katt and Leena had an 
early flight and wanted to be prepared. They also spent quite a few 
hours with Ma and Pa, and walked through a small town, and as soon as 
the sun was gone the two lovebirds drove out in search of an isolated 
place to fulfill their fantasies. Even though they would be leaving the 
house before dawn, and the country itself before breakfast, they wanted 
to enjoy the moment and everything it had to offer. First they kicked 
their shoes off and paraded slowly across the shores in their bare feet, 
then removed all their clothes and splashed around in the water, and 
finally, they fulfilled their desires and made sweet, sacrosanct love 
underneath a blanket of glittering lights.

When Kathlyn awoke alone in her bed in Miss Marbel&#39;s house several days 
later, she would&#39;ve called it all a dream were it not for the souvenirs 
she had purchased, or the sly, soft stare Leena always gave her from 
then on out.</pre>
