Childish Worries

&quot;Here we are.&quot; Amy stopped at the foot of a large tree and gestured to a 
plaque that lay at the foot of the tree. 

Jenn ran up to the tree and looked upon the plaque, &quot;In Memory of May 
Young, let her rest soundly and her heart finally be at peace.&quot; A tear 
rolled down her cheek as Jenn&#39;s knees started to give way and she 
crumbled to the ground, &quot;Oh May!!!&quot; She sobbed, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you come to 
me?&quot;

Kim dropped to her friend&#39;s side, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jenn.&quot; She could not take 
her eyes off the plaque. It was just like the one she saw only the other 
day, just a lot cleaner.

Jenn clenched onto Kim&#39;s bathrobe, &quot;Why? It makes no sense.&quot; Kim held 
her friend tightly letting Jenn continue, &quot;I just saw her the other 
day.&quot; Jenn buried her face in the girl&#39;s robes, &quot;Why didn&#39;t she say 
anything?&quot; 

Kim let out a sigh remembering the scene she had witnessed only the 
night before. May&#39;s confession and in turn her death, &quot;I...&quot; Kim found 
it hard to speak. She wanted to say something, but the words wouldn&#39;t 
form in her mouth. How could she tell her new friend the reason behind 
May&#39;s death?

Jessica stepped forwards, &quot;I&#39;d only heard stories about that day.&quot; She 
said quietly, &quot;They say she was found in the washroom. No one knows what 
brought her to doing such a thing.&quot; She spoke so softly, almost as if 
she didn&#39;t want to wake to girl that slept so far under the tree.

&quot;Why wasn&#39;t I told?&quot; Jenn cried hysterically, &quot;Why???&quot; She looked around 
at the girls that stood around her.

&quot;We have a rule around here.&quot; Jessica said gazing up at the tree, &quot;&#39;Let 
those discover for themselves what is trapped within their hearts and 
minds.&#39;&quot; She looked down at Jenn, &quot;It is hard to tell someone when you 
know it will only hurt them more.&quot;

Jenn stared down at the plaque once again, &quot;Why can&#39;t I remember?&quot; She 
whispered.

Kim suddenly glanced up to notice Kris and a couple of others 
approaching, &quot;Who are they?&quot; Kim asked part out of curiosity and part 
wanting to protect her friend from prying eyes. 

Natalie followed Kim&#39;s gaze and was startled to see Alyson standing 
there, &quot;Alyson?&quot; She said, discontentedly at way her friend was staring 
at her, yet not moving towards them. Then she saw her little sister 
running towards them, &quot; Nicole?&quot; Natalie blinked, even more surprised 
then before.

&quot;Hey Natalie!!!&quot; Nicole called out as she skipped their direction, &quot;Amy! 
I have those files for you.&quot; as if on queue Alyson started after the 
girl, leaving Kris nervously leaning against a tree. Jenn glared angrily 
at the girl from where she sat.

Amy stepped towards the bouncing girl, &quot;I completely forgot about 
those.&quot; She said shaking her head, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, you must have searched 
everywhere for me.&quot; She apologized to Nicole.

&quot;Alyson helped me.&quot; Nicole stated happily, &quot;And I met a new friend.&quot; She 
grinned handing the files over to the nurse. 

&quot;I see.&quot; Amy said returning the girl&#39;s grin, &quot;Thanks for bringing the 
files.&quot; She took the papers from the girl, and then turned to Alyson, 
&quot;And thank you also Alyson. It has been a while. How are you doing?&quot; She 
asked taking the papers from Alyson. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Alyson stated unkindly, it was very apparent that Alyson 
didn&#39;t stand for Amy&#39;s presence.                                         

&quot;I&#39;ll be the judge of that.&quot; Amy flipped through the papers; &quot;I would 
like to see you for a check up sometime soon.&quot; She stopped on one of the 
files and became lost in her thoughts. She peered up from the papers for 
a moment, &quot;I need to get going. I&#39;ll talk to you all later.&quot; She turned 
and started heading towards the school without waiting for a reply or 
goodbyes.    

&quot;Thanks again Amy!&quot; Jessica called out after the nurse only to receive a 
small wave in return.

&quot;Hey Alyson,&quot; Natalie finally found her voice.

Alyson glared irately at the girl, &quot;I don&#39;t know if I should hug you or 
hit you.&quot; She stated, both anger and tears could be seen in the girl&#39;s 
eyes. 

Natalie cringed at Alyson&#39;s harsh words, &quot;I&#39;m sorry... It was sort of an 
emergency... I found Kimberly.&quot; She nervously pointed to the redhead.

&quot;I see that.&quot; Alyson said not so much as giving the redhead a simple 
glance, &quot;We need to talk.&quot; She took the blonde by the hand and hastily 
pulled her away from the group.

&quot;Ohhh... lover&#39;s quarrel?&quot; Jessica teased. 

&quot;Shut up Jessie.&quot; Alyson snapped then dragged Natalie to a set of trees 
in the distance.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Alyson?&quot; Natalie asked uneasily, &quot;Are you mad at me?&quot; She 
suspected that Alyson would be a little angry at her disappearance, but 
was not too sure what to expect out of the girl.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I feel.&quot; Alyson bluntly stated dropping to the ground 
under a tree and watching the group of girls that they just left, &quot;So 
you finally found her?&quot; She asked dismally. 

Natalie sat down next to her friend, &quot;Yeah,&quot; She admitted looking over 
at the redhead, &quot;It was like you said. I followed those feelings and it 
brought me to her. It was rather weird though.&quot; 

&quot;Weird?&quot; Alyson broke from watching the girls to face Natalie, &quot;How so?&quot; 
She asked genuinely curious, she always had an interest in the 
disappearances and reappearances of the residents of the Academy. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Natalie thought about how to describe that night, &quot;I 
found her and that black haired girl sitting next to her in the school 
pool, but not exactly.&quot; 

&quot;The pool?&quot; Alyson turned her head to look in the direction of the pool, 
&quot;Do they have any idea how they got there?&quot; She asked puzzling over the 
situation.

Natalie shook her head, &quot;Nope, and stranger still was the shadow that 
was trying to pull then under. It was bigger then anything I&#39;d ever seen 
before and more then that there was a strange feeling of loneliness 
coming from the creature and I could feel another presence too. 
Something strong and dark with an intent to kill.&quot; 

Alyson looked down at the ground not saying a word. 

&quot;Alyson, are you alright?&quot; Natalie leaned over to get a closer look at 
her friend, &quot;You seemed rather down.&quot; Natalie suddenly got an idea. She 
produced a couple of small throwing daggers from the inside of her left 
sleeve. Smiling at the knives the girl gazed up at the tree to spot a 
few apples hung overhead. She tossed the daggers into the air and when 
then returned to her hands they protruded through two apples. She handed 
one of the apples to Alyson who took it and rolled the apple over in her 
hands. Natalie proceeded to extract the knife from her apple and began 
to peel it.

&quot;Natalie...&quot; Alyson took a deep breath while staring at the apple, &quot;I&#39;d 
like you to stop fighting the shadows.&quot; She said quietly. 

&quot;Why?!?&quot; Natalie was startled by the girl&#39;s requests and cut deep into 
the apple nearly cutting her own thumb, &quot;Haven&#39;t I been of use to you?&quot; 
She flustered. 

&quot;It is not that.&quot; Alyson tried to pick her words carefully, &quot;I don&#39;t 
think it is safe.&quot;

&quot;And what if I refuse?&quot; Natalie was frustrated, why would Alyson 
suddenly be pushing her away like this, &quot;I want to be with you. I was 
going to come back as soon as Kim was settl-.&quot;

&quot;YOU CAN&#39;T!!&quot; Alyson stood up sharply. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Natalie countered, &quot;Don&#39;t you love me?&quot; Natalie said bluntly 
then regretted her words when she saw the shocked look on Alyson&#39;s face. 
The fact was that neither of them had talked much about their feelings 
didn&#146;t help and Natalie clenched her shirt where she would feel the 
necklace against her skin, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry... I thought...&quot; Natalie 
stammered. The two of them had spent so many nights together that she 
could not help falling in love and she genuinely thought that it was the 
same for Alyson, &quot;Forgive me...&quot; Natalie dropped her apple and ran off 
towards the Dorms. 

&quot;Natalie!!&quot; Alyson called out to the girl, but couldn&#39;t find the 
strength to run after the girl. She slowly picked up the apple Natalie 
had just dropped, &quot;I&#39;m so stupid...&quot;
