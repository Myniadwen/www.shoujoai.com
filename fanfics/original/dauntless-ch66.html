<p>“Mystic Alfheim: home of ancient gods and  demons”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>One of the few universal truths in this life is that  every world has its wonders. For example, the fifth planet in the  Helios system is home to the largest and oldest known perpetual storm  in the galaxy, an unstoppable maelstrom as large as an inhabited  world. The second, it is said, has islands that float on the water;  the third is by far the champion when it comes to objects created by  intelligent hands. On Epitaph, there are tales of monsters living in  ancient underground passageways; on Utopia, there is a continent of  paradise floating high above the clouds, impossible to reach save for  the birds. The Elshyrin world has their famed “Cobra Tower”, the  Changelings of Maisa have their unique (and oftentimes ill-planned)  habitats, and the Felinis, their sacred Temple of the Feline, where  it was said their ancestors first conceived. But nearly all of them  are trumped by Alfheim, wonder amongst wonders.</p>
<p>While all the planets governed by the Sindarin and  their kind are magnificent, Alfheim stands above them all as perhaps  the second-most beatific world yet known, rivaled only by Venus, if  the scattered tale of its heavenly development can be believed. The  surface of Alfheim has not been touched for tens of thousands of  years, not since the United Cosmic Military was formed and Gaea was  overcoming her final Ice Age. To do so would be a grave taboo, and of  the few who dared break this law, none were ever seen or heard from  again. Instead, the elves have constructed floating cities on their  vast oceans, and even flying artificial continents in the sky. Many  of their cities, in fact, can be easily moved and have been known to  circumnavigate the globe in a matter of days; a few even move between  neighboring planets.</p>
<p>Despite this concentration of life in the lower  heavens, there are many natural— and unnatural— wonders of  Alfheim that continue to draw a small stream of tourists. One of the  flying continents has an island far away from its shores whose  surface is said to be composed of Mirror Crystals, while another  boasts a Rainbow Bridge, constructed from the fossilized remains of  Prisms. From the oceanic homes, one might glimpse upon the Living  Forest, a cluster of entities said to be plants whom the Sindarin  ancestors gave knowledge. Although there are no deserts, there stands  a Giant Cactus that can be seen once a month by the Imperial Palace;  its existence remains a mystery. There is also the Dawn Wing, a rock  formation shaped like a bird spreading its plumage, which can only be  seen at morning, and the Chimera, a race of deformed monsters who  live on the land. The uttermost north is home to the Ymir Ice  Sculpture, carved by the ancients in honor of their creator god,  while the apocryphal center of the world lays claim to an enormous  tree that is said to spring from the core and reach into the heavens,  lovingly dubbed Yggdrasil by the natives.</p>
<p>Wonders ascend into miracles at the very top of this  tree, which is said only the true Emperor may climb. From there, he  might be able to spot the Migrating Phantom, the roaming spirit of an  unknown Sindarin ghost, forced to orbit the planet until the end of  time. Descending into the ocean would lead this same Emperor to  observe the Undersea Civilization, a realm fashioned long ago by  creatures related to the Mer-folk. And perhaps, if he were brave  enough, he would set foot on the surface— for only the royal family  may do so, and only upon sacred occasions— he would look about, and  in the darkest recesses of the world, which no eye has yet seen, he  would perhaps find Valhalla, Throne of Heroes. Rumored to somehow  connect with the Imperial Palace through deep catacombs, Valhalla is  thought to be the relic of beings from another galaxy, colonists who  found the Milky Way and favored it with their crafts. It is believed  that Valhalla is both tomb and heavenly vessel, a “chariot of gods”  to bear the honored dead to their final resting place. It is also  thought that a powerful mechanical giant guards these tombs, and will  only permit the Emperor to pass.</p>
<p>“That,” said Lillianne Markus to her audience,  taking a conclusive breath, “is basically what we’re dealing with  here. It’s really unlike any world you’ve ever seen. I mean, Gaea  was definitely amazing, I’ll give you that, but Alfheim has her  beat.”</p>
<p>“I still think Venus will outshine them all,”  Aseria said numbly as she crossed her arms. “But even so, it’s  good to be home.”</p>
<p>“Why are we here again?” Valti said impatiently.  The dark-skinned elf sighed and flipped her hair.</p>
<p>“For one, Lil and I haven’t been home in ages, and  I don’t want to keep Father and Mother and the family worried.  There’s only so much that a letter or a call will do. Secondly, I  have some personal business to attend to; third, it would do us all  some good to explore solid land, and refresh our supplies, and see  that there’s more to the universe than just Venus  and…disappointments. Fourth, my half-sister Aria and her  handmaidens have been without my administrations for some time…”</p>
<p>“(Orgies that would make Chandra feel right at  home,)” Lil explained.</p>
<p>“Fifth, I think I’ve a promotion in the Sindar  Special Defense Forces coming; sixth…”</p>
<p>“All right, you’ve made your case! We’ll all go  down there for a few days. Well, most of us, anyway. <em>I’m</em> going, that’s for sure. I want to take a look at those Chimeras.”</p>
<p>“None may set foot upon the holy land save royal  heirs,” Aseria replied airily. “If you must study them, you’ll  have to settle for a telescope at Aqiya. And whatever you do, do NOT  approach the Imperial Palace, or even the surrounding property, if  you can help it, without my father’s or mother’s permission,  unless you’d like a slow and agonizing death. We don’t take  fondly to intruders.”</p>
<p>“So even I would be exempt?” said Lyara wryly.  Aseria smirked.</p>
<p>“You, my dear little thug, would be greeted by a hail  of stones the moment you stepped off the ship. I might tolerate you  but my kinsmen will not.” She waved with a bittersweet smile and  strolled away, Lillianne acting as her consort. Lyara snorted  gruesomely and wandered away in fury.</p>
<p>“Hmph, like I would really want to visit your world  anyway. They’re probably all like you, anyway.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>While a majority of the crew explored Alfheim (or at  least as much of it as Aseria’s friendship would allow), and while  the young Empress-to-be returned to the Palace for a familial  welcome, four other visitors were also making their descent to the  planet, each with their own business to take care of. The first was a  woman tasked with the gruesome occupation of Death incarnate, she who  was once a beloved daughter but was now merely Grave; it was her duty  to remove a life on this world of undying. The second was a minor  half-Inu bounty hunter named Sati Yeriman, come to Alfheim seeking  this Grave woman for the enormous price on her head (apparently, even  Death was not exempt from revenge); the third and fourth arrived  together, former High Priestess of Felinis Marsa Rosemont, along with  her companion and bodyguard— whom she had admittedly grown closer  to during their travels— the immortal Flying Dutchman; their  purpose was yet unknown.</p>
<p>“Tis’ strange to be here now with my mind so  altered,” he stated quietly upon landing. “I have usually not  made it a habit to change it so whimsically, but you, Marsa, fill it  with a reasoning it has not known since my days as a mortal. Once I  felt it necessary to kill the corrupted royal family, but this  behavior has been almost extinguished.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps all you needed was a woman’s touch,” she  smirked. “All the legends about you that I’ve read have suggested  a lady’s love will remove the curse. And it would be my greatest  desire in life to free you from the chains of immortality, Hendrick.”</p>
<p>“Would that it were so!” he exclaimed sadly. “But  venturing here will do little good, Marsa. The elves know life as I  do, or something of the kind. Methinks you believe that if death  could find them, there may yet be hope for me.” She nodded.</p>
<p>“I must also pay homage to a shrine and partake in  their religious ceremonies— and if I could, I would like to explore  their catacombs and learn more of their ancient past.”</p>
<p>“Thy steely resolve in the midst of such gloomy  environs brings a warmth to my cold heart,” he smiled. Barbarossa  had taken it upon himself to protect Marsa, while she vowed to free  him from his everlasting life; the two worked well together. Of  course, even a High Priestess of Felinis would have found it  difficult to maneuver around Alfheim, which strictly controlled and  monitored the foreign population, and while Barbarossa would have had  little difficulty, any effort on his part would certainly lead to  violence, so he would have to be content sheathing his sword while  Marsa negotiated her way through.</p>
<p>Sat Yeriman, on the other hand, had this to say as she  was greeted by the natives: “Hey, leggo o’ me! I said <em>let go!</em> Why’re you dragging me away for, anyway? What’d I do? I’ve got  a landing permit and everything! I’m trying to save someone from  getting killed! Hey!! LET GO!! I’m serious, I— hey, you put that  thing awuhhmn-muhhmn-mllln!”</p>
<p>Bound, gagged, blinded, and partially stunned thanks to  a jolt to the ribs, Sati Yeriman was thrown into a prison cell for  the third time in her life. Luckily for her, she was the kind of  person who learned from past mistakes. Once she escaped, Sati decided  to take a more…subtle route to her prey.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It was no stretch to say that the Imperial Palace was  the greatest wonder of Alfheim, exceeding even the spectacular Moon  Dance, a festival held once every fifty years when the world’s four  moons all rose at the same time. Carved from the rarest building  materials in the known galaxy, supported high in the atmosphere by  sacred land blessed by the last Sindar to leave the surface, and  surrounded by magnificent works of art, it was a legendary feat of  construction, all the more magnificent since no one outside of the  royal family and their attendants could enter it unbidden. The  Imperial Palace boasted some of the finest, most loyal, and most  powerful guards in all the galactic alliance, the elite of the elite,  each one hand-picked by the Emperor and Empress from the Sindarin  Special Defense Forces. A single soldier patrolling the Imperial  halls could wrestle a large boar with their bare hands; several  working in unison could take down a Scorpio in full heat. The palace  was also thick with sorcery, spells that enlightened and accentuated  the skills and minds of the people living there while guarding it  against higher invaders. It is said that in the entire Sindarin  history, no intruder has ever made it more than three levels into the  palace. Lady Aseria, on the other hand, was given an honor guard as  an escort, and her consort was free to wander every door and hallway  she desired.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, young empress,” her attendants said  as they bowed to her. “It’s good to see you again, your highness.  You’re looking healthier and stronger than before, your majesty.  Long life to the Empress Tolan! Your imperial father and exalted  mother will be overjoyed to see you again. Your most excellent sister  will be glad to hear of this news, your highness. Please make  yourself comfortable, your majesty.”</p>
<p>“Things haven’t changed around here much,” Lil  commented. She plastered a smile on her face and waved at a group of  young Sindarin men, who watched her with awe. Aseria looked like she  was in another world, far from happy upon her return.</p>
<p>“It’s Alfheim, what would you expect? Listen,  Lillith: my father’s summoned me to his side, so I’ll probably be  busy for an hour at least. It’s probably just another formality  regarding my promotion. I wish you could come, but you know his  laws.”</p>
<p>“Forward and backward,” she grumbled. “Gods,  leave it to an elf to take two hours to say hello to his daughter. I  guess I’ll go see how Aria and the twins are doing. Might wanna  call the sanitation department.”</p>
<p>“Why?” she smirked as they came to a crossroads.  “Are you planning on killing her or fucking her?”</p>
<p>“Let’s just see how the day goes first,” she  replied cattily. Aseria gave her lover a smoldering stare and touched  her rear end; that would have to hold her until she finished with  business. Just in case, Aseria did summon a sanitation crew and asked  them to remain on standby outside her room. Aria, her frail and  somewhat demented half-sister, loathed Lillianne with a passion, but  this hatred didn’t always lead to destruction. More than once she  had overheard them wrestling and cursing each other, then making love  at the drop of a hat. Hopefully they wouldn’t both be dead, or in a  compromising situation, when she got back.</p>
<p>There were no guards at the doorway to the audience  chamber. Emperor Tolan was so confident of his security that he  boasted that he would openly welcome anybody who had gotten that far,  whether they were friend or enemy. Of course, being one of the most  powerful men in the galaxy loaned the Emperor magnificent fighting  capabilities, which he fairly demonstrated some centuries back  against what seemed to be a superior foe. All visitors had to kneel  before Valorien and Corina; Aseria merely had to bow. She spied her  father whispering to her mother and waited for him to notice her. Not  even she would dare to interrupt them.</p>
<p>“Oh! Aseria!!” Valorien boomed. His voice carried  splendidly; some said he won a battle simply by shouting at the enemy  army. Valorien stood, steady and imposing as a mountain, and waved  his arm. “Many years ago, my younger daughter Aseria Guardea Tolan  was resigned to the fate of the <em>Eldar</em> when several of my  former councilors assigned her to a dangerous section of our glorious  empire! Because it was on fringe territory, she was not expected to  return. Instead, our auspicious offspring earned success in all her  missions, and turned a hopeless venture into a victory for the Sindar  people! Ever since then, she has been a growing figure in the Special  Defense forces, and even the eyes of the United Military are upon  her. People fear and respect her, and they fear and respect the  Sindarin Empire! Now, let us all give praise and be thankful for the  heroic return of the imperial heir!! Organize a banquet, and spare no  expense!”</p>
<p>To hear the Emperor was to obey, and so his attendants  immediately set out to follow his command. Valorien sat down after  giving his speech, and bade his daughter approach. Aseria first knelt  and kissed his feet, then his hand, and finally, his cheeks.</p>
<p>“Father. I am home.”</p>
<p>“My heart is overflowing with ecstasy,” he answered  warmly. He kissed both her cheeks and put his lips to her forehead;  she then stood back and bowed one more time. Minstrels began playing  and three trays of food were presented to the royal family. “There  is much for us to attend to now that you have arrived, Aseria,” her  father began. “Not the least of which is your promotion. Although I  do not believe you’re capable of handling the tasks of an Admiral  yet, you have proven beyond all doubt that you have the skills and  the leadership of a fine officer. Therefore, I would like to appoint  you the rank of Major, and apprentice you under the command of Rear  Admiral Djornyu. We shall have the ceremony in three days. Does this  please you?”</p>
<p>“Thank you, father. I am glad beyond expression.”</p>
<p>“Your face shines like the depths of deep heaven,”  he exclaimed proudly. “It is beautiful. Yes, you will be a fine  Empress. Now for a more pressing issue. It has come to my attention  that you’ve brought foreigners to our soil. It was my father’s  administration that relaxed our time-honored stance on outsiders, and  in my time, I have seen the grip loosen even more. Your companions  will not be killed, Aseria, or imprisoned, unless they give us reason  to do so. However, you will be responsible for them should anything  go awry. I have been informed that there are a few troublemakers in  the group.”</p>
<p>“Yes, father, but they are nothing you should fear.  Somehow our eclectic gathering has achieved balance.” Valorien  gazed at his daughter for a moment, rubbing his eyebrow, grumbling  quietly. Her exalted mother Corina finally spoke.</p>
<p>“We have received word that an escapee from a Rennai  penal colony is among your number, as well as a demonic creature  called ‘the Holy Annoyance’ by the United Military. There are  also a handful of smaller criminals with prices on their heads, a  Norgrim, and even a member of the great Elapidae family with you.  Most distressing are the rumors of Dr. Miracle’s involvement. How  is it that so many people have been able to find a balance?”</p>
<p>“It puzzles me as well, mother, but I do not question  the turn of events. There is a craft aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> that  I in my wisdom cannot explain.”</p>
<p>“Too true!” her father boomed as he rose to his  feet. “That is another matter! I really don’t care if your  companions wander around, but there is a strange power that has  arrived on my world that I have never felt before. The Sindarin  knowledge and skill is ancient and powerful, and it is no mean thing  to say I am a master of these skills. Ours is a craft that can give  life and shape worlds, and that craft flows directly through our  veins, as you have no doubt discovered by now, O my Aseria. But there  is something recently arrived on Alfheim that has my brow furrowing.  For the first time in centuries, I have felt honest fear, and I do  not like it.”</p>
<p>“I believe I know what is causing this, father,”  she replied with another bow. “Some time ago, our crew visited…I  mean, we were <em>allowed </em>to visit a world called Venus, named  after a Gaean goddess. There we came across a land so fertile and  perfect that it exceeded Alfheim’s glory by twofold.”</p>
<p>“Incredible!!” Valorien and Corina hissed, their  faces turning ashen. “Tell us more!”</p>
<p>“As you wish. There, on Venus, our benefactor and  guide recruited a peculiar man that made me feel the same thrills you  are experiencing, father. She said that he came from Numenor of old,  that his was a craft even older and more powerful than our own, and  he was of the Pendragon line.”</p>
<p>Valorien said nothing as he slumped in his throne. He  pulled, twisted, and rubbed his eyebrow, numbly flicking stray hairs  away until finally, he rubbed his face and recovered. “Pendragon,”  he mumbled. “That explains it. You have dangerous allies, Aseria.  Very dangerous allies. One would think you were on a conquest.”</p>
<p>“That does not appear to be the wizard’s intent,  father, nor is it Miracle’s.”</p>
<p>“Then what is their intent?”</p>
<p>“Forgive me, but despite the time I have spent with  her, even I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Corina spoke as her husband sat meditating on this.  “Let us abandon these dark thoughts and focus our minds on happier  news. Our daughter Aseria has returned and we shall soon rejoice it.  If by her word, her allies are trustworthy, then we ought to believe  in her. Let us celebrate her homecoming.”</p>
<p>“You are right,” Valorien replied slowly. “Yes,  the wife of my soul speaks the truth. Let there be festivities so  long as she is here, and let there be an excellent farewell for her  return into deep heaven. My daughter is home and we shall rejoice in  her. All the same, Aseria, I would like to meet this Pendragon.”</p>
<p>“O my father, from whom life itself flows, I will do  what I can. But he may not even obey your word. Regardless, I thank  you from the depths of my heart. May a thousand years of my love  repay you for this welcome!”</p>
<p>She bowed and kissed her mother in farewell, then  returned to her room, full of excitement and joy. She had nearly  forgotten about her earlier dread, but now it came back in full force  as she opened the door. The bedroom was predictably trashed, but at  least the two fighters had gotten it out of their system. They were  both completely naked and trying to out-stimulate each other, and  Aria’s maids were with them.</p>
<p>“Sister!” Aria exclaimed. She wrested herself from  the mounds of earthly delights and threw her arms around her younger  sibling. Aseria blushed and kissed the older woman’s face.</p>
<p>“I suppose old habits do die hard,” she chuckled.  “Forgive my absence, Aria, and my delay. I will do what I can to  make it up to you.” The young empress closed the door and smiled  slyly. Now that business was out of the way, it was time for  pleasure.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>When it was finally over, Lillianne retreated to the  adjacent spare room with Aria’s twin maids, and the three soon fell  asleep together on the large bed, one sister nestled comfortably atop  each of the Mun’s generous breasts. Aria and Aseria, however,  secluded themselves in the royal bedchambers, their bodies entwined,  still plastered with perspiration and sexual fluids. The silence  between the two half-sisters was serene, but somewhat stiff. After a  period where both ladies recovered from their ordeal, Aria looked  into her sister’s eyes, their noses faintly touching.</p>
<p>“It has been far too long.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What did father have to say?”</p>
<p>“Nothing outside of his ordinary pomp.”</p>
<p>“Did he tell you he was leaving Alfheim for a few  weeks, and that your mother would take care of everything while he  was away?”</p>
<p>“No, but father never discusses travel arrangements  with us, unless we’re involved. It’s nothing new.”</p>
<p>“He’s being summoned by the United Alliance.”  Aria’s voice was fringed with importance, but Aseria didn’t know  why. This was nothing unusual either.</p>
<p>“So? Father is a key member.”</p>
<p>“He has been discussing it for some time now. This  gathering will be different. Only a select few will be there. It  seems that the Director of the military and someone in charge of a  transportation service have been upset about something.”</p>
<p>“They’re humans,” Aseria sighed carelessly,  “being upset is what they’re about.”</p>
<p>“You may dismiss it if you like, Aseria, because you  have been out traveling with that Mun whore. You have been absent far  too long.” She clutched her sister with sharp fingers; whether out  of spite or lust, there was no telling. “Father is beginning to  grow concerned about something. There is a force at work stronger  than the <em>Eldar</em>, I can feel it. Stronger than that dog you’ve  got on your leash.”</p>
<p>“Lillith is not a dog, Aria. She’s very special to  me.”</p>
<p>“More special than me? <em>I</em> should be the one at  your side, not her!” Aria’s passion was boiling; the room began  to shake under her stress. She calmed herself before any damage was  done and caressed Aseria’s face, kissing it as a peace offering.  “Forgive me. I spoke out of place. I am the one without purpose  here; I simply wish to aid you. You will be Empress; I am nothing at  all. I am not jealous for your title, my only real love, simply for  your heart.”</p>
<p>“You have it all and more,” Aseria whispered  sweetly, licking Aria’s long pointed ear.</p>
<p>“I know,” she shuddered. “But I should still be  at your side. I fear for you sometimes. Whatever is concerning father  is stronger than you, I’m afraid. Perhaps even stronger than I.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is stronger than you, dear one,” Aseria  cooed. She kissed her several times and shifted her body so her bare  skin would send jolts of delicious friction down Aria’s spine. The  tactic only worked for a moment.</p>
<p>“I have felt it. And there are great disturbances  here on our world now. I do not mean your companions, though I sense  one has strength beyond reckoning.”</p>
<p>“That moronic genie, no doubt,” Aseria muttered.  “But what else could you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean— ” She was suddenly silenced, and offered  a frail, frightening smile. “Don’t leave me here anymore, I beg  you! Take me with you! I will become <em>her</em> lover as well, if  that’s what it takes! Just let me be by your side! Me and my maids—  nothing could make me happier!”</p>
<p>“I can’t,” she whispered desperately, “you know  that.”</p>
<p>“Please!!” she exclaimed, shrieking as quietly as  possible. Aria was frail but now her grip was smothering. She nearly  broke her sister’s arms pleading with her. “Is there no room on  your ship for us? I have to be with you! There’s something  terrible…I have to protect you…and I crave you more than my own  life! I beg of…”</p>
<p>Aria roared suddenly and threw herself, and her sister,  across the room, tumbling out of the bed into a cabinet, upsetting  several small trinkets. A perfume bottle broke against them,  saturating them with an alien fragrance. Aseria didn’t even have  time to think about what was going on before the ceiling caved in and  down came a figure swathed in dark robes, wielding a large scythe. It  carved the bed in two with a single stroke and charged after the  half-sisters the moment it spotted them cowering in the corner. Aria  screamed a brief incantation and thrust the intruder back against the  wall; they bounced off, slipped under the collapsed awning of the  bed, and threw their coat away.</p>
<p>“You cannot resist! There is no craft in this world  that can save you! Resign yourself to your final fate and come in  peace!” Aseria’s rage boiled as she composed herself and stood  alongside her sister, naked, to confront the menace. She would never  forget that face for as long as she would live.</p>
<p>“You’re as persistent as your title would claim,  angel of death, but I’m afraid you’re outmatched. There is a  legion of Sindarin warriors in this palace all hours of the day, and  they will tear you apart upon my command! You will not harm my  Lillith again.”</p>
<p>“I am not after your companion today, elvish  princess,” said Grave huskily. “My target is your sister, Aria  Felasse Tolan. She must die today.”</p>
<p>“Who are you to threaten me?” Aria shouted.  Suddenly she fainted, weary from exerting herself so much. Aseria  caught her, covered her with a robe, and glared daggers at Grave.</p>
<p>“This is a woman who thinks she has been given the  right to take lives. She has attempted to murder Lillith and many  others. I think you have underestimated my sister, fool. Though she  may be feeble, she has the power to wipe continents off the map and  slay immortals— and I, with my own royal lineage behind me, will  not suffer you the pleasure of her demise. Leave us while you are  still master of your fate!”</p>
<p>“You cannot negotiate with me,” Grave murmured  darkly. “Stand aside, young princess, for I despise taking lives  before their appointed time. Indeed, you have many years upon you,  Tolan, and a blessed reign, but this one is scheduled for my blade.”</p>
<p>The door to the other room burst open, splinters and  boards and jewels spewing everywhere. Aria’s twin maids, hastily  dressed and pale with fright, rushed to their mistress and shielded  her with their bodies, while Lillianne charged headlong into the  intruder, smashing her onto the floor and into the wall. Everything  happened fast but Aseria wasn’t the kind to be stunned so easily;  she quickly took her sister into her arms and rushed her outside,  sounding the alarm.</p>
<p>“That all you got, bitch?” Lil snarled, lifting  Grave by her shirt. The young woman was bleeding at the mouth and her  right shoulder was dislocated, but her eyes still smoldered.</p>
<p>“I am not after you today! The bastard heiress of  Alfheim is the one I’m chasing. Let me go so I can fulfill my  duty.”</p>
<p>“Whoa, seriously? You’re gonna knock off Aria? Well  why didn’t ya say so!!” Lil laughed and helped Grave to her feet,  dusting her off and straightening her hair. Grave grunted as she  reattached her shoulder and licked her bleeding lips; the wounds  healed magnificently for a human. “Gods, I thought you were after  Aseria! Hell, I’m sorry for roughing you up like that. Hey, if I  can help you out in any way, just let me know.”</p>
<p>“That won’t be— ” Grave was interrupted as a  score of hardened Sindar soldiers stormed into the room, armed to the  teeth. Since they knew not to attack the Mun, their only other  logical target was the sandy-haired girl next to her, the one armed  with the sickle that glowed like the four moons during the climax of  the Migrating Phantom.</p>
<p>“Leave her to us, Lady Markus! See to it that the  young mistresses are safe!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, guys, take it easy! Chill-ax, okay? She’s  cool. Miss Laval here’s only after Aria. She’s not gonna kill  Aseria!” The guards glanced at each other in bewilderment, and  resumed their approach. Grave covered her face in frustration.</p>
<p>“Why is it that I never get the simple jobs? They  always have to be complicated.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sati Yeriman tilted her water bottle back  for the last time, draining it completely. Escaping from her cell had  been easy enough, but the prison itself was another matter. She had  fought through two soldiers before she was overpowered by the third—  to her considerable humiliation— but luckily, she was spared an  execution when a certain Felinis Priestess came by. Marsa and Sati  didn’t know each other, and since the Inu and Felinis had been  enemies several centuries ago, the situation could’ve gotten a lot  worse. But Lady Rosemont did not become priestess for nothing, and  soon everything was smoothed over and the two were becoming friends,  of a fashion.</p>
<p>“I don’t think my face will ever stop being red,”  Sati admitted as she tucked the bottle away. “First I’m thrown in  prison, then I’m beaten by only three elves, and to top it all off,  I’m rescued by a Felinis! Not that I’m ungrateful, of course. My  pride’s just taken a beating, is all.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the worst of it, then you’re very  fortunate,” Marsa replied warmly. She and Sati liked each other  immediately; there <em>was</em> no grudge as far as they were  concerned. “But I’m confused. I thought foreigners weren’t  treated poorly anymore on Alfheim. You seem like a nice person,  albeit…ah, very spirited, so why were you in prison in the first  place?”</p>
<p>“How should I know?” she winced. “The damned  fools never told me anything. I thought people had <em>rights</em>,  even on a world like this. Anyway, I came here on business. There’s  a bounty I’m after, and I’m guessing she may have something to do  with my arrest.”</p>
<p>“That does sound reasonable,” Barbarossa said.  “More than once I’ve faced unnecessary obstacles thanks to  duplicity. Perhaps we might be able to help, although I do not  believe milady would get herself so involved.”</p>
<p>“Every story has two sides,” she quoted. “But I’m  also a Felinis, and curiosity runs in the genes. So who are you  after?”</p>
<p>“A young woman calling herself Grave, the Angel of  Death. There is a family willing to pay a high sum for her capture.  It seems she’s an effective killer.”</p>
<p>“One can hope,” Barbarossa whispered grimly. Both  women heard him and stared quizzically. Their attention was diverted  to more pressing matters as an alarm sounded, and soldiers mounted  flying machines heading for the palace. Sati watched them zealously,  knowing that they were probably after the same thing she was.</p>
<p>“I think I found her!” she exclaimed. She ran to  find a transport; Marsa called out for her to wait while the Dutchman  followed at a slower pace. A small group of Sindar spotted Sati and  surrounded her, grabbing her with hands as strong as granite,  shouting in their poetic language. They threw her and mounted the  machine; soon all the rides were gone, and Sati was left to shout and  curse by herself.</p>
<p>“Damn it, what a bunch of cocky bastards! I’m  trying to help them, for crying out loud!”</p>
<p>“The Imperial Palace is restricted unless you have  permission,” Barbarossa announced flatly. He crossed his arms and  stared at the hovering construction. “Or…if you’re a soldier  and there’s an emergency. Well, it looks as if something’s coming  back. I wonder if this is our friend.” Marsa looked at her guardian  and saw a glimmer of hope and excitement in his ancient sea-grey  eyes. She knew what he was thinking, that this Angel of Death might  possibly offer him release from his eternal prison, and didn’t know  whether to hope with him or feel concerned for his fatalism. Of  course she wanted to free him— but a part of herself wanted, very  slightly, for that day to be delayed a little.</p>
<p>The vessel did not contain Grave, but two elvish  princesses, the sisters Aria and Aseria. Aseria recognized all three  of them; she swung at Barbarossa and struck him on the jaw.</p>
<p>“Bastard! Go to hell! You’re as bad as that damned  maniac! You there— Sati, right? What are you doing with this  monster?!”</p>
<p>“Wait a second, I don’t know what’s going on! Why  did you hit him? Who’s that with you? And what the devil’s going  on at the Palace!!”</p>
<p>“Enough!” Aria exclaimed, grasping her forehead in  pain. She wobbled and swayed to Aseria’s side, and leaned against  her for support. “This was supposed to be a day for joy, but  instead it’s been nothing but havoc. Everybody and everything is  getting in my sister’s way. If we can’t have some peace and  quiet, I’ll see to it that you all burn in the fires of  Musphelheim!”</p>
<p>“Peace, your highness,” Marsa said firmly. “The  three of us mean you no harm. As for the young Empress, Lord  Barbarossa will keep to himself, and will cause you no concern. We  are journeying together and are caught in the middle of whatever  fiasco has erupted. Please, tell us what has happened.”</p>
<p>“Aseria, is she there?” Sati demanded, grabbing the  young empress. “Did you see a young woman calling herself an angel  of death?”</p>
<p>“Why, are you friends with her?” she snarled.</p>
<p>“Of course not! I’m after the price on her head!”  Surprise struck the Sindar’s face, and her shoulders relaxed. She  smiled feebly and let out a haggard breath.</p>
<p>“Forgive me. Aria’s right: this day has gone from  good to terrible in a very short time. That woman you’re looking  for jumped in on us and attacked us. Lil ran in to save us, and I had  the guards move in. I promise that if there’s anything left of her,  you can take her in and claim your prize.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, if anything’s left?”</p>
<p>“Everyone be quiet,” Barbarossa said, his voice  strong and commanding. “Empress Aseria, it seems you and your  sister were not the only people who escaped in the confusion.” They  all looked up, and sure enough, a small dark speck was heading  straight for them, growing larger until it took the shape of a  transport. Inside was Lillianne, the twin maids Sylpheed and  Sylvannas, and the new Angel of Death. She jumped out first, coughing  violently.</p>
<p>“Ugh, finally! Ten minutes locked up with a person  wearing that much perfume is a crime! Don’t you have any  restraint?”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s Aseria’s favorite brand, and I haven’t  worn it since I left! I need to get good and saturated in case I  don’t come back for awhile! Oh, hey there lemon tart! Sati, Marsa,  great to see you! Wow, you two have gotten sexy since I last saw you!  Aw, damn, downer patrol! You two freaks are still alive?!”</p>
<p>“<em>Her</em> again,” Barbarossa grumbled.</p>
<p>“Lillith, what <em>are</em> you doing with that  monster?!” Aseria screeched.</p>
<p>“Sylpheed, Sylvannas! They didn’t hurt you, did  they?” Aria cried.</p>
<p>“Holy crap, she’s gorgeous,” Sati murmured as  Grave took several cleansing breaths. She had no idea the new Angel  of Death was <em>beautiful</em>. Grave noticed her and smiled  awkwardly; usually she didn’t receive compliments. Lillianne  scratched her ear as she realized what this gathering meant.</p>
<p>“Whew, and it hits the fan.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“This is an unexpected blessing in disguise,” Aria  purred maliciously. “I have two enemies in my sight, and my anger  has been called forth. For my sister’s sake, Lillith, I have spared  you until now, but I can no longer abide by you. She is my blood and  we belong together. I have no idea what trickery you used to seduce  her, but it’s over now. I’m going to wipe you out once and for  all with the Soul Reaver!”</p>
<p>“If I had a gold coin for every time she’s said  that,” Lil answered casually. “Listen, Aria. Can’t you just  forget all this and drop dead? Aseria chose me over you, which is  really no surprise. Incest just isn’t that common a practice on  Alfheim anymore. Besides, I’m younger than you and in <em>much</em> better physical condition. You won’t believe the kind of fucking we  do while you’re wasting away in your cold little room. You know, I  really pity those poor girls, having to take care of a sickly little  weasel like you. They deserve to be with us!” She laughed out loud;  Aria retaliated by throwing one of the pins in her hair. It caught  Lil in the abdomen, silencing her very effectively.</p>
<p>“You witch! The only reason Aseria chose a whore like  you was because you cheated her away from the only person that ever  really loved her! You don’t even have that to claim! She’s just a  doll you can screw around with and pretend to care about whenever  it’s convenient! You know, I’m going to spare the Soul Reaver  until last so that I can steal the rest of your lives one after the  other! Each death is going to be more miserable and gruesome than the  last!”</p>
<p>“Are you following any of this?” Sati said to  Grave. Arine placed her hands on her head and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“Not really, no. It sounds like these three have a  history. Ugh— see, this is one of the reasons why I hate my job. I  mean, somebody’s gotta do it, but it causes nothing but trouble.”</p>
<p>“I know, and getting involved in something like this  has to happen a lot. I’m starting to feel sorry for you.” She  smiled at the sandy-haired girl, who gave her a rather sweet grin.  Sati blushed and played with her fingers; she never imagined she’s  be making friends with Death. “Um, you know, you sort of have this  price on your head. That’s why I’m here.”</p>
<p>“You’re a bounty hunter?” Grave’s smile  saddened and she put her arms on her pockets. “Sometimes people  can’t come to terms with their death. Their survivors seek  vengeance, and are willing to sacrifice everything they have to  satisfy their anger. It’s such a wasted effort…and it’s not  like I <em>enjoy</em> it.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it must be a tough job, and you seem like  a really nice person.”</p>
<p>“Normally I am!” she chuckled. “But every so  often, I’m called in for work, and I have to get it done.  Otherwise, people will continue to suffer. Did you know that if I  never stepped in to take anybody away, they’d just get older and  older, and the pain would grow and grow until it couldn’t even be  tolerated?”</p>
<p>“Really? Gosh, I never really thought about what  might happen if someone didn’t die.”</p>
<p>“Well <em>your</em> mother is so ugly, the sun won’t  even rise until she leaves the planet!”</p>
<p>“Your mother is so fat, she needs two zip codes!”</p>
<p>“<em>Your</em> mother is so fat, when she turn around,  she levels a mountain!”</p>
<p>“They’re becoming more juvenile by the minute,”  Sati groaned. “I almost wish they’d just fight and get it over  with.”</p>
<p>“They hate each other too much to resolve anything,”  Aseria mentioned. “The only time they make peace is when they have  sex.”</p>
<p>“So rip their clothes off or something! It’s  getting annoying! …Anyway, I don’t think I’ll be turning you in  or anything. I’m sure that you have your reasons for doing things,  and you’re just trying to live day by day like the rest of us.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Grave replied, beaming beautifully. “I  don’t meet many people as kind as you in my line of work. What did  you say your name was again?”</p>
<p>“Sati, Sati Yeriman. I think I already got yours.”  Grave faced her with outstretched hand, and Sati took it shyly.</p>
<p>“Arine, Arine Laval. Very pleased to meet you. Now if  you could please excuse me, Sati, I really do have to get back to  work. I hate to say it, but Aria Felasse Tolan is reaching the end of  her life. I must make the transition as smoothly as possible.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Hey, when you’re done, maybe we can  go out on a date later!” Arine was surprised at the sudden  proposition, but didn’t seem hesitant about it in the least, and  nodded enthusiastically. Aseria nearly had an aneurism.</p>
<p>“WILL YOU STOP FLIRTING WITH HER AND HELP ME OUT,  YERIMAN!!!”</p>
<p>“I’m not flirting!” she wailed, and jumped in to  break up the fight. Sati kicked Lil as hard as she could in the  stomach, and pushed Aria with all her might. She got a knuckle  sandwich to the face for her first effort (even though Lil did go  down), and a fire spell to her tail for the second (which Marsa  quickly helped put out).</p>
<p>“Damn— <em>kuff, kuff— </em>you’re strong, bitch!  Shit! We should…wrestle sometime…ugh.”</p>
<p>“It’s no more than you deserve for attacking my  sister like that!” Aseria yelled. “As for you, Aria, I am sorry  for neglecting you, but Lillith— I mean, Lillianne is…well, she’s <em>special</em> to me. You are the love of my life, Aria, and nothing  will ever change that, but…there’s just something that compels me  to be with her. I can’t explain it. It’s as if forces beyond my  reckoning are keeping us together.”</p>
<p>“To hell with that!” she shouted. “Open your  eyes! She’s a witch!”</p>
<p>“All right, that’s enough soap operas for today,”  Marsa said, stepping between them all. “Let’s try and solve  things peacefully. First off, I’m glad that Sati and Miss Laval  have come to terms. Secondly, we should all lay down our arms and  bury our hatchets for her highness’s homecoming. Lord Barbarossa  and I have been invited to her welcoming banquet, and I’d like for  all of you to come as our guests. We should be raising our cups  today, not our swords. Miss Laval, do you truly mean to kill this  young lady, when she has done you no wrong?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, but it’s this whole death thing. If I don’t  take her, she’ll wither up from her disease and end up worse than  before. I’d be doing her a favor.”</p>
<p>“We don’t need your favors,” Aseria snarled.  Grave sighed in defeat.</p>
<p>“I can wait for another time if it’s really that  important to everyone, but I <em>will</em> come back. You can’t stop  death, not even if you’re a Sindar.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,” Marsa replied.</p>
<p>“Who made you the high councilor?” Aria groaned as  her maids lifted her to her feet. As she limped back to her  half-sister, the elf quietly murmured the incantation for the Soul  Reaver, an attack she claimed could slay immortals. She would wait  until the proper moment to reveal her true intentions.</p>
<p>“I don’t see anybody else trying to calm you thugs  down. And I <em>am</em> a Priestess, or I was, at any rate.”</p>
<p>“She’s the best candidate in my opinion,”  Barbarossa said. He noticed Aria chanting something but didn’t  think too much of it until she approached Lil, who was still doubled  over in pain. Marsa was perched over the fallen Mun, trying to  recover her body if not her pride, hence the Dutchman’s sudden  concern. He didn’t know what the princess had planned, but he had  sworn to protect the Lady Rosemont at all cost, and rushed in to save  her from whatever mischief was in store. Of course, he also rescued  Lillianne in collateral— and was right in the line of fire when  Aria struck.</p>
<p>“If there was a god, this would kill him. SOUL  REAVER!!!”</p>
<p>The entire world seemed bathed in an unnatural  rainbow-hued light, as if a second sun had come to shine on the dark  side. The oceans shivered, and waves crashed against the forbidden  shores all across the globe. The floating cities vibrated, the  citizens fearful for their lives. The air became so thick that it  absorbed all sound, and so for one brief instant, there was silence  throughout the whole planet. Most dramatically, though, the sun in  the sky seemed to sink a little faster for a moment, before it  resumed its normal pace. This happened because for that one moment in  time, all of Alfheim raced four hours ahead on its axis, one for each  of the moons that floated in the heavens, alarmed at what they were  witnessing. The Deplorable Craft had been revealed for the first time  in eons, fully concentrated on one man.</p>
<p>Although the flash of light was not blinding, nobody  could see for a few seconds. Barbarossa was bathed by it as the Soul  Reaver took control of his body and, gradually, devoured him whole,  breaking his molecular structure down and throwing his atoms into a  vacuum. It all happened in a matter of seconds but the aftershock of  such a horrifying attack would last for the remainder of the week as  the coastline suffered flooding, clocks everywhere would have to be  reset, and the cities would be in need of small repair. Aseria,  Lillianne, Sati, Grave, and Marsa stood gaping in a circle, stupefied  and silent. Aria was the only one that could move, and she only moved  to drop into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>“Holy shit burgers,” said Lil. It was definitely  the most eloquent thing to say at the time. The others gradually  broke away from the shock: Aseria rushed to her sister’s side,  Grave ran fingers through her hair, thankful that she had avoided a  similar fate, and Sati, well… Sati took a little longer to recover.  Marsa was at least in a somber mood, and knelt down to examine the  area where the Dutchman last stood. Emotions swirled and clashed in  her heart— love, grief, sorrow, joy, relief, amazement, gratitude,  guilt— they overpowered her and drew tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, Hendrick…are you really gone? Did that do it?  Are you free? I’m ashamed to admit that I did not want this moment  to come so soon…but all the same, I am glad for you. No suffering  now shall you endure. For thy eternal years you gave me life anew—  you saved two souls for thy own! I thank you, Aria, though you did  not mean for this to happen. He may rest now.” Marsa put her palms  together and closed her eyes in solemn prayer. Sati finally snapped  out of it as Grave shook her.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you all right? Get a hold of yourself!”  She blew an exhausted breath.</p>
<p>“That was really freaky.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Rather than stay and bid her sister a painful farewell,  Aseria left as soon as the ceremonies for her promotion were over,  telling no one of her plans save her parents. Valorien also parted  for the alliance meeting; he understood his daughter’s desire to  return to work, and did not urge her to stay longer than she needed.  Aria’s maids would have to explain everything once their mistress  woke from her long slumber, and there was no doubt that she would be  stricken by the news. But she would endure the loneliness: it gave  her prime opportunity to eliminate all of her sister’s enemies and  rivals, from the youngest infant to the oldest noble, men and women  alike, until her sister’s path to the throne was cleared. Perhaps  one day she would be reunited with her sister once and for all, slay  the demon that had ensnared her, and live out the rest of her life in  servitude and devotion. The Venusian medicine Aseria left behind  would see to that.</p>
<p>True to their word, Grave and Sati abandoned the planet  for other pursuits, neither one finding any reason to return in the  future. Grave despaired at her work but was overjoyed to find a new  friend; Sati was merely excited and anxious for their date. What  would her parents think, she wondered, if she told them she was  courting Death herself? Or Kaori, for that matter! It would’ve been  disturbing if it weren’t so funny.</p>
<p>And so, in spite of a rather monumental setback, life  on Alfheim resumed its stagnant course, with politics swirling just  as the oceans below and the breeze above. Corina Guardea spent her  days tending to matters of state, and her nights in the arms of  temporary lovers, as it was custom for people to do when their  husbands or wives left. Aria soaked her hands with blood and watched  as her maids loved her, and each other. And on a cold, windswept  plain, not far from the landing platform for vehicles commuting from  the Imperial Palace, a small pile of ash was gradually forming,  slowly gaining shape, as winds blew more flakes and particles  together, until a mass had grown over long patient hours. From this  mass came a form— indistinguishable at first, but eventually  turning into something familiar, something alarming— something that  was alive.</p>
<p>A loud gasp signaled the dawn of a new day.</p>
