<a href="../original/testfire-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Jack took the pouch of coins, quickly weighing it by
feel then simply setting it aside. Davidson was the
Shogun&#39;s man, and Jack knew there was no way that he&#39;d
disrespect her or the Shogun by trying to play her
out. &quot;All right,&quot; she nodded as she sat on the corner
of her desk, &quot;who do I have to protect?&quot;

&quot;Motoko?&quot; Davidson turned while still leaning on his
cane, looking out to the hallway where Jack had heard
a presence moments before.

The redhead entered the room silently, keeping her
head downward respectfully. She stopped by Davidson&#39;s
side and looked up, green eyes set in a clearly Asian
face, her smile tentative as she said, &quot;It&#39;s an honor
to meet one so highly regarded, Scott-san.&quot;

&quot;Jack is fine,&quot; she answered crisply, feeling a flash
of anger when she was the bruises the young woman was
trying to hide. She had issues around people hurting
women, and if she could she liked to make them pay
personally.

&quot;Motoko Fitzgerald works as a hostess over at the
Nightingale,&quot; Davidson pushed up his glasses, &quot;it&#39;s
where I met her a few moths ago.&quot; He paused, looking
grim, &quot;It was outside of the club where she was
attacked.&quot;

&quot;Then whomever&#39;s after you, Mr. Davidson, also knows a
great deal about your personal life to target you,&quot;
Jack noted. She paused a second, &quot;You&#39;re married?&quot;

Davidson didn&#39;t answer, but he hesitated a telling
moment. Motoko colored slightly, opening her mouth to
say something then shut it.

&quot;Not any of my business,&quot; Jack tossed that aside, &quot;but
I&#39;ll have to keep it in mind.&quot; She looked over at
Motoko, brown hair falling over her blue eyes,
&quot;Motoko-san, you know that Davidson is hiring me to be
your bodyguard?&quot; She waited for the nod before
continuing, &quot;I&#39;ll do my best not to inconvenience you,
but there may be some disruption to your life.&quot;

&quot;I trust you know best,&quot; Motoko bowed again, her
simple black dress hugging her slim body, the gold
jewelry she wore subtle and tasteful.

&#39;Not at all what I expected when Davidson called her a
goodtime girl,&#39; Jack mused. She looked at the older
man, &quot;When do you want me to start?&quot;

&quot;Immediately, if possible,&quot; Davidson answered
promptly. He smiled grimly, &quot;I&#39;ll only be free to act
if Motoko is kept safe.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;m ready to go,&quot; Jack offered her hand and
Davidson shook it firmly.

&quot;I feel better already,&quot; Davidson answered as he
slipped his hand free. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse us a moment?&quot;
he took Motoko aside. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; he said to her in
unaccented Japanese, &quot;Jack Scott is very good, you&#39;ll
be safe.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Davidson-sama,&quot; Motoko answered in the
same tongue, &quot;I am glad that Scott-san turned out to
be less crude than I was expecting.&quot;

Jack had to fight back any sign of amusement. &#39;Wonder
if I should tell them I speak Japanese?&#39; she wondered
as she tidied her desk.

&quot;Things will be resolved in a few days,&quot; he continued
in Japanese, &quot;I promise.&quot;

Motoko bowed slightly, &quot;I look forward to hearing of
your success.&quot;

Switching back to English Davidson turned to Jack, &quot;I
advanced you five days fees, things should be resolved
before then.&quot; He walked to the door, hesitating a
moment before adding, &quot;And thank you for taking the
job.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Jack answered as she watched him go.
&#39;This Motoko is important enough for him to hire me to
protect,&#39; she mused, &#39;but not for a tender farewell?
Interesting.&#39; She turned to Motoko and studied her a
moment, &quot;So, do you have a preference where we hole
up?&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Motoko looked surprised, pushing her red hair
back nervously.

Jack smiled slightly, &quot;The best way I can guard you is
to take you to someplace reasonably secure and wait
there until things are resolved.&quot;

Motoko shook her head gravely as she said, &quot;I can&#39;t do
that, I have committed to work tonight at the
Nightingale.&quot;

&quot;Is your job worth your life?&quot; Jack asked curiously.

&quot;I gave my word,&quot; Motoko answered, though she had gone
visibly pale.

Jack did her best not to swear, though it took some
effort. Going out was spectacularly stupid if she
really was targeted, but Motoko seemed to be
determined. &#39;And I did take the job,&#39; Jack reminded
herself. &quot;All right,&quot; she nodded, &quot;then I&#39;ll be coming
along.&quot;

That evening the stars glittered in the night sky
above Vancouver, the lack of lights from the city
making it even more visible. The Nightingale was
safely within the Shogun&#39;s territory, a two floor club
off Main street in what had once been a business
office. Connecting walls had been knocked down and
rooms connected, the various decorations giving it an
almost 1950&#39;s feel.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t quite expecting this,&quot; Motoko commented as
they entered the main room, soft music playing in the
background. She looked elegant, the green dress
swirling around her legs as she nearly slinked across
the floor.

Jack tugged at the hem of her little black dress,
smiling wryly. &quot;I hope I don&#39;t look too bad in it,&quot;
she answered, reaching up to touch the discrete
earrings she was wearing. She grinned, &quot;Though I know
it&#39;s not my usual look.&quot;

&quot;You look lovely,&quot; Motoko murmured, a faint smile on
her face.

Jack plucked at the front of her dress wryly, &quot;Too bad
I&#39;m so pitifully endowed.&quot;

&quot;Welcome, Motoko,&quot; one of the servers beamed, the
little blonde looking amused. She looked Jack over,
&quot;Who&#39;s your friend?&quot;

Motoko smiled hesitantly, &quot;This is Jac...&quot;

&quot;Jaclyne,&quot; Jack stepped in smoothly to say, &quot;I&#39;m
visiting from out of town and I asked Motoko to show
me around.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; the blonde smiled, &quot;my name is
Chizuru.&quot; She looked over at Motoko, &quot;Are you taking a
shift tonight?&quot;

&quot;Yes, as usual,&quot; Motoko nodded. She looked over at
Jack, &quot;I&#39;m sure my friend understands.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jack smiled back wryly as she added, &quot;but
I hope you don&#39;t mind me tagging along as much as I
can?&quot;

Motoko was about to protest that when Chizuru chuckled
and said, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll be too much of a
problem.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Motoko agreed faintly.

They made their was through the front rooms where men
and women talked, drank and listened to the music.
Over on one side a small stage was set up, a oddly
familiar looking woman standing there, her voice sweet
as she sang to the eagerly listening room.

&#39;Jade Flower, Heather,&#39; Jack recognized her as she
followed the two to the back. &#39;Hope she doesn&#39;t call
attention to me or changing my usual look this way
will be for nothing,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Get ready,&quot; Chizuru smiled as she left, &quot;a few of
your regulars are here tonight.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Motoko nodded as she sat down at a dressing
table and threw a glance at Jack, &quot;and tell them
there&#39;ll be another girl guest.&quot;

&quot;Got it,&quot; Chizuru waved.

&quot;Are you planing to shadow me all night?&quot; Motoko
frowned, &quot;What if I decide to go home with a client?&quot;

&quot;Not going to happen,&quot; Jack said as she watched Motoko
clean her face then carefully begin applying makeup.
She smiled at Motoko&#39;s frown, &quot;This isn&#39;t a bawdy
house, you might keep them company but you don&#39;t go
home with them.&quot;

&quot;Very sharp,&quot; Motoko nodded slightly.

&quot;Which makes me wonder why Davidson lied to me at
first,&quot; Jack noted, &quot;claiming you were a goodtime girl
and his lover.&quot;


&quot;You&#39;d have to ask him that,&quot; Motoko finished her
makeup, her face now subtlety different, more western
and less Asian looking.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Jack&#39;s eyes widened as she finally saw
the resemblance skilled use of makeup had hidden,
&#39;she&#39;s not his lover, she&#39;s Davidson&#39;s daughter.&#39;

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Motoko asked as she smoothly
rose to her feet.

&quot;No, nothing,&quot; Jack smiled. &#39;If someone knows that and
is targeting her,&#39; she thought as they walked out
together, &#39;this could get a lot nastier than I had
thought.&#39;
