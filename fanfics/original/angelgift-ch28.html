<a href="../original/angelgift-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>A few days later the older man smiled tiredly, sitting
there in the station commander&#39;s office surrounded by
all the status files and damage reports. &quot;I don&#39;t know
how we can thank you,&quot; Hawke said honestly.

Allison Tennison shrugged, looking up at the image on
her bridge viewscreen. &quot;We were glad to help,&quot; she
answered honestly, her short brown hair tucked beneath
her uniform cap. &quot;But I will pass on your thanks to
the engineering crew,&quot; she added.

Princess Jenna smiled from where she sat nearby, the
black haired beauty looking over at her lover in
pleasure. &#39;And she&#39;s learning diplomacy, too,&#39; she
mused silently, &#39;I think the captain&#39;s role has been
good for her.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate that,&quot; Hawke agreed. He flipped
through some of his files, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say there
aren&#39;t many crew I can transfer over, but we do have
several midshipmen who were stranded here by the start
of hostilities.&quot;

&quot;Midshipmen,&quot; Allison echoed, wondering if the word
meant the same thing in English, &quot;officers who have
completed their training but haven&#39;t served yet?&quot;

&quot;Precisely,&quot; Hawke agreed. He checked his paperwork,
&quot;They were meant to have been picked up a few weeks
ago, but their assigned ship never appeared.&quot;

Commander Laurel D&#39;ken smiled wryly as the blue haired
officer said to Allison, &quot;We&#39;ll need to nursemaid them
a bit but I think they&#39;d be able to manage well
enough.&quot;

&quot;Then I think we&#39;ll take them,&quot; Allison agreed. The
young captain looked at Hawke, &quot;We&#39;ll slip-transit
them over when you&#39;re ready.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll signal you, ma&#39;am, and send over their
dossiers,&quot; Hawke agreed then signed off.

&quot;I wonder how long it&#39;ll take before I get used to
having someone older than I call me ma&#39;am?&quot; Allison
mused aloud.

&quot;You&#39;ll adapt,&quot; Jenna chuckled.

&quot;So, when will you be having your first captain&#39;s
dinner?&quot; Laurel changed the subject.

Allison looked sheepish, &quot;Now that someone&#39;s finally
told me about it,. I was thinking of tonight. Sort of
a get to know you better meal for the command crew...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve settled in to being captain so well, I forget
you don&#39;t know the customs,&quot; Laurel said a bit
apologetically.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t remind her,&quot; Jenna added.

&quot;Jenna and I will be there,&quot; Allison said quietly as
the bridge bustled around them, &quot;and you, Lucas Anais
and Sam C&#39;tarn. I&#39;m just not sure what to do with the
other three places at the table.&quot;

Laurel gave Allison a thoughtful look. &quot;You don&#39;t have
to have all the seats filled,&quot; she said mildly, &quot;but I
could make a few suggestions.&quot;

&quot;Which we were hoping for,&quot; Jenna smiled.

&quot;I&#39;d recommend your friend Sharin as she&#39;ll be working
with the command staff and our new gunnery officer
Amara,&quot; Laurel said evenly, &quot;and an ensign or middy of
your choice.&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Allison smiled, &quot;I was thinking about
inviting one of my friends but I was worried the crew
might think I was favoring them.&quot;

&quot;Allison,&quot; Jenna chided, &quot;they&#39;d never think that.&quot;

&quot;Actually they might,&quot; Laurel answered, &quot;if you hadn&#39;t
been bending over backward to be fair the past few
weeks. If anyone had any doubts they were erased when
you dressed down Kat in front of the crew for sleeping
on the job.&quot;

Allison really didn&#39;t know what to say, so she kept
silent.

There was a soft beep from Laurel&#39;s console and she
smiled slightly, &quot;I just received the Midshipmans&#39;&#39;
files, I&#39;ll review them before we transport them
aboard.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Allison nodded as Laurel got up and left
the bridge.

Sitting at the tactical station Amara exchanged a
questioning glance, but otherwise the black haired
woman kept her mouth shut. Sharin shrugged, the blonde
navigator turning back to look at the sentinel station
that hung out in space beside them.

Most of the crew had already heard about the &#39;Kat
incident,&#39; as it was being called. Kat had fallen
asleep on duty down in sickbay, not during an
emergency, thankfully, but still it was dangerous...
Allison had actually confined her to quarters for a
week, in addition to her still having to perform all
of her medical duties. Since then she had taken her
job much more seriously, and the crew had treated
Allison with a deeper respect.

Ensign Kayla Shen spoke up, disturbing the silence as
she reported, &quot;The sentinel station is hailing us
again.&quot;

&quot;Put them on,&quot; Allison answered crisply.

It wasn&#39;t Commander Hawke this time, but his second in
command David. He briskly said, &quot;The midshipmen are in
our transfer bay, waiting to come over.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll transport them over,&quot; Allison said simply, &quot;and
thank you.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; David said coldly then signed off.

&quot;Warm guy,&quot; Amara murmured.

&quot;I was in the academy with him,&quot; Kayla commented,
surprising them as the officer was usually very quiet,
&quot;he was like that then, too.&quot;

Allison activated a control on her chair and contacted
the transit room. &quot;The midshipmen from the station are
ready to transport over,&quot; she said to the officer on
duty, &quot;once they&#39;re here escort them to the
Commander.&quot;

Lieutenant Alex Keron replied, &quot;Will do, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Within the transit chamber a faint purple glow danced
along the walls, gradually growing brighter. On
command the light concentrated in the center of the
room as a group of four young men and women took shape
within the chamber. All wore the standard uniform of
the fleet, and looked around them with bright,
interested eyes.

&quot;My name is Lieutenant Alex Keron, I&#39;d like to welcome
you all aboard the Liberty&#39;s Sword,&quot; Alex said to them
warmly.

All of them stiffened and saluted, probably a bit
surprised to be greeted by a lieutenant. A young woman
who&#39;s uniform insignia showed she was a top graduate
stepped forward, her stance pure military. &quot;Thank you
sir, we&#39;re glad to be here,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;m Rachel
A&#39;Tor.&quot;

Col&#39; Tyrr, Cybele Merr and Valentee Fai all introduced
themselves before the group left the bay, heading
towards the lifts. Col&#39; Tyrr&#39;s green hair fell down
his back in a ponytail, the muscular young man
frowning slightly as he noted the few people in the
halls. &quot;Excuse me for asking,&quot; he hesitated, &quot;but is
this vessel under strength?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Alex answered frankly, &quot;this ship was under
repair when we were relaunched.&quot;

&quot;Intriguing,&quot; Cybele murmured to herself, the young
woman striking with her blonde hair, dusky skin and
red eyes.

&quot;What was so urgent that you had to launch under
strength?&quot; Valentee asked, her green hair swept back
from her face.

&quot;Save the questions for later,&quot; Rachel looked over her
fellows sternly. She looked a bit apologetically to
Alex, &quot;Sorry, sir.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s understandable,&quot; Alex agreed as they entered the
lift and rose smoothly through the vessel. He smiled
at them as he continued, &quot;Now I have a question for
you, how long were all of you stuck on the station?&quot;

&quot;Forever,&quot; Col&#39; groaned.

&quot;A few weeks,&quot; Cybele corrected, a slight smile on her
face. Quietly she conceded, &quot;It certainly began to
feel like forever.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully this will be more exciting,&quot; Valentee said
impishly.

&quot;I think we can pretty much promise that,&quot; Alex agreed
with a odd little smile.

&#39;Interesting, very interesting,&#39; Rachel thought.

They exited onto one of the upper levels of the
vessel, not far from the bridge itself. With a fast
stride Alex lead them down the hall, reaching a door
labeled the Commander&#39;s office. He pressed the door
signal and announced, &quot;The Midshipmen are here,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Send them in,&quot; Laurel answered crisply. She looked up
as they entered, eyes studying each of them intently.
She smiled slightly as they lined up nervously beside
her desk, waiting for her to speak. &quot;Welcome aboard,&quot;
she said gravely, &quot;we intend to work you to the bone,
I&#39;m sorry to say.&quot;

&#39;Just like my own middy cruise,&#39; Alex thought to
himself with amusement, &#39;I guess some things never
change.&#39;</pre>
