6:30 am

 

Batter my heart, that I may rise, and stand,

O&#39;erthrow me, and bend Your force,

To break, blow, burn and make me new...

Take me to You, imprison me, for I

Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,

Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.

&quot;May we honor those who came before us,&quot; Leena stated solemnly, breaking 
the circle. In the pre-dawn haze of the morning before what could very 
well be their final battle, taking a moment to step onto this sacred 
ground and cite the ritualistic chant that kept their hearts burning 
took a rather calming turn. Nerves were still frayed, but the 
tranquility of the field and the unity of the sixteen women standing 
there kept them under control; it was the difference between anxiety and 
determination.

&quot;Well,&quot; said the Coach as she looked at her watch, &quot;we have about six 
hours before we need to be here again, so what say we go out for 
breakfast and make sure we&#39;re ready? My treat.&quot; The general consensus 
was positive, so the girls headed off first, shaking the dew from their 
cleats. Leena noticed something out of the corner of her eye, and felt a 
pang of warm nostalgia clutch her heart. She turned to her team and 
said, &quot;You can go on without me; I&#39;ll catch up. Just walk right into 
that Perkin&#39;s we saw earlier and save me a spot. Remember, a light 
breakfast! You&#39;re eating for energy, not fulfillment. We can gorge 
ourselves later- win or lose!&quot;

She waved at them and turned to the vision that had captivated her. Not 
far away, on the other side of the field, was a group of young women 
standing around in a circle. A tear came to her eye as she recognized 
what they were doing, and- more importantly- who they were. She 
approached them once they finished their ritual.

&quot;May we honor those who came before us,&quot; the ladies recited. One of them 
spotted a visitor approaching, and shrieked for joy as she recognized 
her. &quot;Leena!!&quot;

&quot;Hello, Captain Baum. It&#39;s been awhile. How are you all doing?&quot;

Blake Baum, Erica Fox, Raisa Zanders, Rochelle Klein, Ivory Tran, Kula 
Nanahara, Rozalia Milkos, Janine Bautista, and Ayanna Montgomery rushed 
up to their former coach and gave her a big group hug.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Ivory squealed. Leena chuckled.

&quot;It&#39;s a long story.&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Dies Fatali, Part 1&quot;

 

Everyone noticed that Leena was acting unusually happy as they sat down 
together for breakfast. She was beaming when she walked in and 
practically skipped over to the table, humming merrily as she sat down 
and read her menu. One got the impression that she must&#39;ve been in a 
daze, for she didn&#39;t read through her choices so much as glance at them 
and make an idle decision. She put the menu down at once and leaned 
forward, staring into space as her cheeks glowed. She looked infinitely 
gorgeous but it was also unsettling.

&quot;Uh, C-Coach?&quot; Amy said. &quot;D-d-did something happ-pen? You l-l-look 
really happ-py.&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t have time to get laid,&quot; Fleur muttered. &quot;And she doesn&#39;t 
play the lottery.&quot;

&quot;I think she&#39;s in love,&quot; Freya sang.

&quot;Maybe she saw someone she knew,&quot; Lauren shrugged. Leena chose that 
opportunity to snap out of it and pointed at the young woman.

&quot;You win the grand prize, Miss Ofdensen. Although Freya is right too, 
but that&#39;s not what this is all about.&quot; She indicated the lovely 
radiation in her face and sat back in her chair, trying to calm down. 
&quot;It wasn&#39;t just one person I ran into: it was a whole bunch of them. 
They were alumna of the school I used to teach at before I came here.&quot;

&quot;We never knew about that,&quot; Felicity said. Freya looked baffled.

&quot;Yes, even I wasn&#39;t aware of it. My sources must be deteriorating.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no big secret,&quot; she gestured, &quot;Long before I came to Carnegie, I 
was the physical education instructor at Stanton public high school for 
girls. I met some of my former students earlier.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s nice! Were they here for the game?&quot;

&quot;You could say that,&quot; she smirked. &quot;Actually, they&#39;re on the other 
team.&quot;

&quot;Oh wow, that&#39;s epic,&quot; Jen murmured. &quot;So we&#39;ll be going up against 
people you&#39;ve coached.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the old versus the new,&quot; Fausta said, chortling faintly. &quot;Sounds 
like something out of a good drama, almost.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not too surprising,&quot; Leena shrugged as the drinks came. She had a 
few sips and continued: &quot;Most of those ladies were heavily into sports, 
so I expected we&#39;d run into a few eventually. I just didn&#39;t expect so 
many of them to be on the same team.&quot;

&quot;So is there anything you can tell us about them?&quot; Valencia asked 
hopefully. Kasumi nudged her.

&quot;Honey, she may not be willing to tell us secrets about her former 
players.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind telling you a little bit about them,&quot; Leena answered. &quot;In 
many ways, they&#39;re a lot like you all: the same problems, the same 
dreams, the same strengths, the same obstacles...most of them are the 
same age as you, too. A number of them are even still in the same 
relationships they had when they were in high school.&quot;

&quot;That long, huh?&quot; Leena smirked.

&quot;Yes, some of them prefer a steady companion. Anyway, I better tell you 
what you&#39;re up against, seeing as how we seem to be the underdog here. 
Their captain&#39;s name is Blake Baum. She used to have ADD, but she turned 
out to be a magnificent player.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard about her!&quot; Shannon exclaimed. &quot;We met a coupla times before 
I came to Cahnegie! She&#39;s a really nice gal and a really great playah.&quot;

&quot;Would you say...aggressive?&quot;

&quot;Not really. But she&#39;s a good leadah and a good spoaht. We should be so 
lucky.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s also Erica Fox,&quot; Leena resumed; &quot;her sister Alisha used to be 
on the team, but she moved away and the two don&#39;t talk very much. She&#39;s 
not as athletic as either of you,&quot; she pointed to Terra and Amy, &quot;but 
she could give you a run for your money, and she&#39;s got experience on her 
side. Rai Zanders is one you need to look out for.&quot;

&quot;Now I know that name,&quot; Fausta pointed. &quot;So she&#39;s here as well? It&#39;ll be 
some game.&quot;

&quot;Is she good?&quot;

&quot;She beat me at tennis once,&quot; she deadpanned. &quot;She&#39;s also quite 
exceptional with music...not that any of you rubes would appreciate it. 
Except you, Berkeley!&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Elisa grumbled.

&quot;The most aggressive ones are Klein, Tran, and Nanahara,&quot; Leena resumed. 
&quot;Aintzane- Rochelle now- isn&#39;t afraid to get dirty or bloody, and she 
once had a rivalry with Petra Rominostikovh.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, bad newz,&quot; Nadia muttered. &quot;If this girl iz good as Petra, we are 
not in good standz.&quot;

&quot;Ivory Tran&#39;s an all-around athlete and a huge flirt. She knows how to 
get in your head and mess with you. Kula Nanahara&#39;s small, but she&#39;s 
fierce, and fast as hell. Rozalia Miklos and Janine Bautista are a 
surprise, and I had no idea Ayanna Montgomery even liked sports, so 
watch out for anything. I didn&#39;t see their Coach there.&quot; The group was 
relatively silent for awhile as they took this information in. Leena 
must have been feeling a little at odds, having to confront her former 
students (even if it was only a practice game), but sometimes coaches 
have to do this: it was her trial just as much as theirs.

&quot;Well,&quot; Valencia exclaimed, trying to cheer everyone up. &quot;Why don&#39;t you 
tell us a little bit about your career there?&quot; Leena smiled and reached 
for another drink. Their food came while she was weaving her story.

&quot;There&#39;s not much to describe. I came from Finland because I had an 
excellent job opportunity at Stanton, and I stayed there until last 
year. During my tenure, I had the privilege of meeting several promising 
young ladies, like yourselves, and teaching them to hone their bodies 
and minds. America was a nation overwrought with obesity; I wanted to 
give these people the knowledge to fight this disease and live healthy, 
energetic lives. Of course, some of them used those skills for sexual 
purposes, but who was I to judge?&quot; The team snickered as she came to her 
inevitable conclusion. They thought she would lead to that eventually- 
and really, a school for girls only? Surely one or two of them must have 
found love in their own locker rooms.

&quot;During my first year, we got as far as the semifinals in the state 
championship, which was pretty good for a ragtag team. After that, we 
were on fire. We even went national one year.&quot;

&quot;So why&#39;d you change jobs? It sounds like you had a sweet life.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; Leena smiled, &quot;but there were certain circumstances that kept 
me from staying there. It wasn&#39;t jut one reason, mind. Stacie calling 
me- I mean, Ms. Rosewood- was probably the best reason for me to leave. 
I couldn&#39;t very well refuse such a heartfelt request.&quot;

&quot;So basically you&#39;re here for us,&quot; Fausta said, blushing a little. Leena 
smiled softly and nodded.

&quot;It&#39;s what I do. There&#39;s a certain joy that comes with bringing out the 
innate talents of young people. My own mentors felt it and I&#39;ve wanted 
to follow their example ever since. It&#39;s the duty of us old people to 
teach you young ones.&quot;

&quot;Yah hardly what I&#39;d call old, Coach,&quot; Shannon smiled. Leena smirked 
wryly.

&quot;Older, anyway.&quot;

 

- Elisa Berkeley, Favorite color: navy blue; left midfielder/reserve-

 

The gymnasium was already crowded and bustling with activity as 
Fitzgerald and his fencing team made their way in. The bleachers and 
seats were filled with spectators, judges, coaches, families, and loved 
ones; the floor was thick with the noise of steel lashing against steel 
as contestants practiced, warmed up, and measured their opponents&#39; 
skill. A group of referees were clustered in a corner and there were 
several registry booths set up. The tang of sweat and metal was mixed 
with excitement and energy: spirits rose and palms started to sweat.

&quot;So this is the regional fencing meet,&quot; Rain observed, thrusting her 
hands in her pockets. &quot;Cool.&quot; She glanced around for her parents but 
couldn&#39;t see them in the crowd. They were giving up a lot to come here; 
sometimes she wished they would just quit and leave her alone. Really 
now, was she worth this much trouble...?

&quot;Take your positions over there,&quot; Fitzgerald said, pointing to an area 
reserved for his students. A fairly decent banner reading &quot;CARNEGIE 
UNIVERSITY&quot; hung above it, impossible to miss. Rain blinked suddenly as 
she was assaulted by camera flashes, and glared in their direction. Oh. 
There they were.

&quot;What a bunch of dorks.&quot;

&quot;Parents?&quot; Merinas said. Rain nodded.

&quot;More like idiots!&quot;

&quot;Show a little more gratitude,&quot; she muttered as she put her mask on. &quot;At 
least they bothered to come.&quot; She called Straik out and started warming 
up on her lunges; Rain sighed and decided it was high time she begin her 
own routine. But...all those flashes...

&quot;Would you stop it already?!&quot; she yelled, waving her arms in the air. 
&quot;God, you&#39;re like the friggin&#39; paparazzi!&quot; Fitzgerald turned his head 
and glared at her, but resumed registration without delay. Hopefully 
that would be the last embarrassing thing Miss Howlet did today.

 

&quot;Leena looks pretty good!&quot; Ivory exclaimed as she undressed. Ayanna 
smiled.

&quot;I know. Hard to believe she&#39;s...what, thirty-five?&quot; Ivory counted the 
difference on her fingers and confirmed it. &quot;Do you think she and Katt 
are still together?&quot;

&quot;I saw her wedding ring,&quot; Janine said.

&quot;Wow. It&#39;s still hard to believe they got married!&quot; Ivory grinned at her 
foxily.

&quot;Hey, if I can do it, anybody can!&quot;

&quot;Are you worried about her?&quot; Janine smirked. Tran-Yi snorted.

&quot;Hells no! Annie&#39;s gonna go all Ides of March on those suckers! She&#39;s 
gonna kick Yuki&#39;s ass and take back her title! Sorry, Kula.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize to me,&quot; she snorted. &quot;She&#39;s not my girlfriend anymore.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but she is mine,&quot; Ayanna pointed. Ivory gave her a startled 
expression; apparently she hadn&#39;t heard yet.

&quot;Dude, seriously? When did this happen?&quot;

&quot;Somewhere between &#39;it&#39;s none of&#39; and &#39;your business&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t asking you, Hula-Kula.&quot; Kula glared but returned to dressing 
just as quickly, plainly aggravated but also trying to retain her focus. 
Ah, missed opportunities...

&quot;I&#39;m getting too old for this nonsense,&quot; Rai murmured.

&quot;We&#39;re girls, it&#39;s what we do,&quot; Rozalia shrugged. Janine smiled at 
Blake, who had been strangely quiet since earlier that morning. She 
touched her shoulder and roused her.

&quot;Hey, you all right?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; she grinned, sounding melancholy. &quot;It&#39;s just that seeing Leena 
today made me remember the old days.&quot;

&quot;For real. I didn&#39;t expect to see her at all. I mean, I know she moved, 
but...&quot;

&quot;I hate thinking about the past,&quot; Blake murmured, shutting her locker 
sharply. She groaned softly and leaned her forehead against the cold 
metal, looking like she was about to cry. Janine knew exactly what was 
going through her mind and embraced her captain from behind.

&quot;I know. It still feels like it only happened yesterday.&quot;

&quot;What happened yesterd- oh.&quot; Ivory&#39;s timing was horrible, as always, but 
she wasn&#39;t insensitive; she backed away with a gentle smile. &quot;I&#39;ll just 
leave ya to it then. I&#39;ll tell Anderssen you might be a little late.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bother, I&#39;m just reminiscing,&quot; Blake muttered. Her eyes were shut 
and her fists were trembling. She had been carefree up until now, but 
thinking about their times at Stanton, and what they all did when they 
graduated, and the tragedy that occurred later... Rai sympathized, and 
cupped Blake&#39;s cheeks. She smiled and kissed her forehead tenderly.

&quot;Tell you what: how about we all visit them together after this game? 
Would that be okay? It has been awhile.&quot;

&quot;Not nearly long enough for me,&quot; Blake whispered. A tear came down her 
eye as she fell into Rai&#39;s warm embrace.

&quot;I know. It still hurts. But we&#39;ll go see them. We&#39;ll ask Leena to come, 
too. We&#39;ll make a day of it. Does that sound all right?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; she nodded meekly. Rai kissed her again and patted her back. 
The mood was broken suddenly as another person burst through the door, 
smiling and jumping.

&quot;Hey everybody! Aww, you&#39;re already dressed? No fun for me! Kimmy, let 
me grope you for good luck!&quot;

&quot;Not now, sweetheart,&quot; Rozalia whispered as she approached the girl. She 
kissed Mira van Dijk on the lips tenderly and caressed her face. Mira 
noticed Blake and Rai hugging, and sharply apologized.

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Blake sniffled, standing up on her own again. &quot;I&#39;m making a 
scene. I just like to have a good weep at it once in awhile. How&#39;s the 
baby coming along, Mira?&quot;

&quot;Little Kimberly is resting so beautifully,&quot; she whispered, stroking her 
belly. Ivory gawked at her protruding tummy and laid her hand on it. She 
felt the life inside respond.

&quot;Damn, girl! You might just give birth right here! Ha...wouldn&#39;t that be 
a hoot?&quot;

&quot;I still have a few weeks left,&quot; Mira chirped. She kissed Rozalia again 
before leaving, giving her bottom a tiny tap. Ivory sprawled her arm 
over Rozalia&#39;s shoulders and grinned lecherously, just as she did once 
upon a time, back when they were all so young and full of promise.

&quot;You&#39;re a lucky woman, Rozy! We all are! I don&#39;t know about anybody 
else, but I want to see what these new people are all about! If Leena&#39;s 
coaching them, they gotta be good, right? So let&#39;s break these bitches 
in, baby!!&quot;

&quot;Always so elegant,&quot; Erica chuckled. She too had been silent, but her 
worries were different from the others&#39;. &quot;Captain, after you.&quot; Blake 
smiled and put her hand out; everyone piled theirs atop hers and they 
prepared for what would no doubt be an amazing game.

&quot;I dedicate this to our fallen sisters and loved ones, who are watching 
from above- those who could not be here today, but are with us in 
spirit- those who are yet to be born, who will bring us new life and new 
joys- and of course, to Leena, and her new team, that they may fight 
well and have a good game. Let&#39;s make them proud.&quot;

&quot;LOVELAAAAAAAAAACE...GO!!!&quot;

 

- Fausta Nazario, Favorite color: purple; sweeper-

 

&quot;Point: Howlet! The winner is...Carnegie!&quot;

Rain let out a relieved breath as she saluted to her defeated opponent. 
The first round of the preliminaries was over, and Carnegie&#39;s fencing 
team was sweeping the competition like dust. She didn&#39;t expect them to 
really win, but neither did she expect them to lose so thoroughly. Not a 
single one of Fitzgerald&#39;s students had been defeated; few of them even 
allowed their opponents to score. This was an unquestionable testament 
to Fitzgerald&#39;s methods, and it proved he had the capacity to bring out 
greatness in anybody (yes, even an &quot;enormous wreck&quot; like Rain). He 
applauded as Rain left the mat and even smiled a little- not at her, at 
the team, although Rain liked to fantasize that part of his praise went 
directly to her. She was, after all, something of a &quot;special&quot; case.

She sat with her team and sprinkled her face, neck, and lips with water; 
she drank slow, trying to make it last. Those last duels were really 
little more than an exercise: Fillmore was decent enough for a school 
its size, but they had no outstanding players, and their coach was 
something of a sluggard. But they did well enough. Yates was next, 
another unremarkable school; Lovelace and Turing were sending their 
students in later, and Fitzgerald made sure that everyone would observe 
them meticulously when the time came. As Rain watched several more 
schools competing, she looked at the gym clock and noted that the soccer 
team would be starting its game. Her greatest desire at that moment was 
not to win any awards, but to be there for her friends. She was already 
starting to miss them and wished she could pull away, even for an 
instant, even if only once.

&quot;This will take forever,&quot; Straik sighed next to her. He nudged Rain and 
smiled. &quot;Howlet, what say you come with us and catch the soccer match? 
Humbert smuggled a radio and I hear there&#39;s a pirate station 
broadcasting the game. Four of us are slipping away while we can.&quot;

&quot;Seriously? Isn&#39;t it just a practice match?&quot; He shrugged curiously.

&quot;People from Anolis came all the way to our school for theirs. Some 
people are just devoted.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure it&#39;s okay?&quot; He snorted and leered at his coach.

&quot;We&#39;ll only be gone for awhile. We won&#39;t be fighting anybody for a 
quarter-hour at least. I hear you have a friend or two on the team.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; She felt a knot in her stomach, but ultimately decided to 
follow them. They snuck away from Fitzgerald and their teammates, and 
slipped through the gym until they found an abandoned weightlifting 
room, complete with water fountain and television. Humbert already had 
his radio on, Rain listening attentively as the feed came to life.

&quot;- by Zanders. That gives Lovelace an early lead, 1-0. Carnegie&#39;s 
looking a mite sluggish out there, but they&#39;re bound to pick up the pace 
soon. Lovelace is only warming up and they&#39;ve yet to reveal their true 
colors, so now would be the time for Carnegie to strike. Lacroix has the 
ball and is driving it through. She&#39;s recovering from a twisted ankle 
from their first practice game, and is looking all the stronger for it, 
though I wonder if her footwork can hold out. Passes to Andre...Andre 
takes it deep...we haven&#39;t seen a lot of aggression from her in the past 
two games, but now she&#39;s acting boldly. Whoops- lost it there for a sec. 
Fox drives it hard and fast, passes to Nanahara, she goes down and makes 
another shot...that was pretty sloppy.

&quot;Ofdensen caught it with no trouble and throws it to Nguyen- well, 
hello! Nguyen just shot out of there like a cannon and...holy moley, is 
she going for another offensive? No, she&#39;s passing it to 
Khovansky...Khovansky to Velur...Tran-Yi is coming down and...whoa! Not 
a pretty fall! Velur takes a dive- she&#39;s okay, folks- the ref doesn&#39;t 
call it- but someone in the crowd doesn&#39;t like his call!&quot;

&quot;Probably her father,&quot; Rain smirked.

&quot;Tran-Yi&#39;s going down to finish what Nanahara started...she&#39;s going 
deep...Nazario and Threal are surrounding her...Tu is set to attack, 
but- whoops, there she goes! Tran-Yi&#39;s like greased lighting out there. 
She&#39;s going further...Nazario&#39;s hitting hard- and heeeeere comes Baum! 
Zanders and Baum, a pair for the ages! Nazario&#39;s got nothing on these 
two and...holy cow, Ofdensen caught another one! A strong kick by Ivory 
Tran-Yi, but Lauren Ofdensen grabs it anyway! How did she do that, 
folks? Now it&#39;s back to Tu, but will Zanders and Baum let that last save 
slide? Tu&#39;s taking it in...passes to Nguyen...Nguyen&#39;s really something 
out there, folks. She never showed this tenacity in either of the last 
two games, but- well, back to Velur, Velur sends it to Beckett... We&#39;ve 
seen good things from the &#39;secret weapon&#39; from Washington, DC. Beckett 
drives it hard down the line...Baum intercepts, kicks long to Fox, Fox 
drives deep- oops, Threal practically runs her over and gives Carnegie a 
BIG lead! She&#39;s going...she&#39;s going...wow, can that girl run! Here comes 
Khovansky to back her up...Lacroix is dealing with Nanahara...Zanders 
coming in fast- Zanders caught it!- no, Beckett&#39;s got it! She&#39;s going 
for the goal! She&#39;s going!! NO!! Saved by Klein! Wow! That&#39;ll wake you 
up in the morning! Beautiful play by both sides! You can tell they&#39;re 
really fighting for their lives down there!&quot;

Just as everyone was really getting into the game, another fencer burst 
in, saying their turn was up. They howled, hissed, and cursed, but their 
time was up, and so they stood up to return to their match.

&quot;Aww, damn it! Just when it was getting good, too,&quot; Rain sulked. Straik 
smiled sadly and put his arm on her shoulder.

&quot;We&#39;ll come back soon. Time to put your game face on.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know.&quot; Slinking back to the tournament and donning her mask 
was one of the most dreadful things she had done in recent years. Rain 
didn&#39;t just listen to the game: she had gotten absorbed in it, and not 
just for Carnegie&#39;s sake. Lovelace was performing brilliantly as well, 
and something inside her was igniting- something very strange and a 
little unwelcome. She almost wished, for a second, that she had actually 
been there, not just cheering but playing as well, shoulder-to-shoulder 
with friends, staring down an opponent that seemed worth all the 
trouble. Rain had loved fencing ever since she got into it, but for the 
first time ever, she was actually having doubts about her choice.

&quot;Do well,&quot; her coach stated as her turn came. Her focus was much looser 
now and she found herself wavering. Surely once she got into the spirit 
of things, she would forget about her ambivalence and be back to her old 
self.

 

- Felicity Velur, Favorite color: pink; forward-

 

Rain half-grumbled, half-sighed as she dipped her head down for a long, 
thoughtful drink. She had found her way back to the weight room which 
had become her hope, and turned Humbert&#39;s radio on. Right now the 
fencing matches were occupying the last space of thought in her mind; 
she was so overwhelmed with everything else that it was all she could do 
to swallow and keep everything down. She thought she had wanted to be 
here- to earn her glory after so many years of sacrifice and training- 
to repay Fitzgerald for his generosity and patience- to prove she wasn&#39;t 
just a disaster waiting to happen, that there was really something 
there. That had been her whole world, and her only true wish.

But. How three letters can suddenly change the course of one life. She 
turned the volume up a little, and heard that Carnegie was still 
trailing 1-0 near the end of their first half. Lauren had been injured 
after a fierce assault, so Valencia was called in to replace her. Elisa 
was beat, and Nadia was starting to get weighed down by the pressure. 
Even Kasumi had a worried expression in her eyes, according to the 
announcer, and Fausta...

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rain didn&#39;t hear anybody sneak up on her and 
jumped, her heart racing. She let out a ragged breath as she saw another 
fencer standing there, smiling apologetically. &quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to 
sneak up on you. I just noticed you looked really exhausted, and...I&#39;m 
sorry for intruding.&quot;

&quot;No, come on in, it&#39;s a free break room.&quot;

&quot;I mean in your... Well, if you insist.&quot; She gracefully entered the room 
and sat down on a bench. Rain sat across from her and gave the other 
woman a once-over. She was incredibly beautiful, tall and dark with very 
seductive doe-eyes, but her smile was honest and her poise was truly 
ladylike. The most astonishing feature about her was her hair, 
shimmering rich auburn, thick and lush, and the way it formed a halo 
around her body. Rain had never seen her before and was mesmerized. This 
was the kind of woman who could put Muses out of work. It was nearly 
love at first sight.

&quot;Exhausted, huh?&quot; Rain smiled palely. &quot;Was my performance really so 
terrible?&quot;

&quot;You won the match, so it couldn&#39;t have been that,&quot; the woman indicated.

&quot;My mind&#39;s not on the game,&quot; she muttered. She indicated the radio, and 
the brunette listened for awhile before the volume was turned down.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she grinned. She winked at Rain and seemed to sympathize with her 
feelings. &quot;Do you know someone there?&quot;

&quot;Just friends at Carnegie.&quot; The woman folded her hands; her every action 
seemed a work of art.

&quot;I have friends at Lovelace, people I know and love quite well...and one 
in particular who has held my heart all these many years.&quot; Rain leaned 
forward, feeling a strong connection with this woman now that they had a 
plight in common.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it bug you to be here while they&#39;re out there? Don&#39;t you just 
wanna...throw all this away and rush to their side?&quot; The woman laughed 
melodiously, a sound created by love for the sheer expression of joy, as 
far removed from a mocking cackle as her beauty was from the whole lot 
of mortals.

&quot;It&#39;s because I love her so much that I have the strength to stay here. 
I mean, at the tournament- dueling and such. And it&#39;s hardly the first 
time we&#39;ve been separated. There have been far longer hiatuses than 
this...and every time after, our love is strengthened and renewed. I 
have so much faith in her that I know exactly how she is feeling even in 
the middle of a match- that no matter what the circumstance, she will 
perform wonderfully and let her true heart shine. That is why...&quot; She 
looked down serenely at her hand, touching a band of gold around her 
left ring finger. Rain&#39;s heart caught in her throat; she was nearly in 
tears by the beauty and power of this woman&#39;s conviction.

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t have a bond that grandiose. I just want to be with them. 
I&#39;ve never questioned my decision as a fencer until now, but...my life 
seems so dull and empty next to theirs. And I haven&#39;t even known them 
for that long! It&#39;s like they&#39;ve broken in and disturbed everything I 
ever knew, and...I&#39;ve enjoyed every minute of it! Does that make any 
sense?&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she exclaimed proudly. &quot;I know exactly what you mean. Ivory 
was the same when I first knew her. Now we&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy for you,&quot; Rain whispered. &quot;But it&#39;s not that easy for me. Can 
I talk with you about it for a moment? Will you mind? I won&#39;t be up for 
awhile, and...I really need to get this off my chest. Will you keep this 
in confidence?&quot;

&quot;Of course! Who better to listen with an unbiased heart than a stranger? 
Besides, I&#39;m not busy either.&quot; Rain&#39;s shoulders slumped and she sighed, 
then broke all her barriers and poured her heart out. The nameless 
brunette sat through her diatribe patiently- sometimes smiling, 
sometimes petrified intently, sometimes reaching out to hold Rain&#39;s 
hand- what a touch she had! When at last Rain confessed that she felt 
she was at a crossroads now, the brunette simply shook her head, looked 
into her eyes, and spoke directly to her heart.

&quot;Long ago, I had to make the same decision. The fight was between two 
pieces of my heart: the cold shell I had put up, and the part where I 
wanted to love again, in spite of the cost. Do you know what I did?&quot;

&quot;You followed your heart,&quot; Rain guessed. The woman nodded.

&quot;I followed my heart.&quot;

&quot;But what if I&#39;m wrong? All those years...the sacrifices that had to be 
made...my promises...my devotion...&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s only one person who can answer that,&quot; the woman said as she 
stood up. She leaned forward to kiss Rain&#39;s forehead and smiled sweetly. 
&quot;But I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll make the right decision. I have to leave now- I&#39;m 
up next. Take care.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Oh! The name&#39;s Howlet- uhh, Rain. Rain Howlet.&quot;

&quot;Well then,&quot; she curtsied, &quot;take care, Rain. It was nice meeting you!&quot;

&quot;But what&#39;s your...&quot; She called out just as the other woman ran off to 
rejoin her team, leaving behind a mystery. Rain sulked for a moment, but 
then stood bolt upright, terrified out of her wits, as her coach entered 
the room and glared at her.

&quot;Return to your position immediately, Miss Howlet,&quot; he stated icily. Her 
mouth hung open but she could not even make a sound. His face was as 
cold and hard as a glacier: you could not tell if he was infuriated or 
merely annoyed. But Rain didn&#39;t want to test him, and so she followed 
him out of the room, but not before giving the radio one last chance.

 

Two to zero, Lovelace. Halftime.

Helmuth Fitzgerald sighed with relief as Rain won her third match 
(decisively, at that) and returned to her team. He was glad to find out 
one of his best pupils was just experiencing some last-minute rebellious 
behavior; he didn&#39;t want her causing any more trouble for him today, nor 
ever if possible. He didn&#39;t completely rebuke her for her rash behavior, 
though: he did suppose more than one of his students was curious about 
that game. He looked at his watch and noted they would be halfway 
finished by now, and wondered if, perhaps, he could slip away and drive 
down there to catch the second half. The tournament had a few more 
rounds to go and Carnegie would be given an extended rest: their next 
challenger was Lovelace, of all schools. How apropos that both the 
school&#39;s sports teams- one sponsored by him and the other by Rosewood 
and the board- would be facing the exact same school on two different 
grounds! It was enough to make him smirk.

&quot;I suppose I could spare a few minutes. I needn&#39;t remain long,&quot; he 
murmured to himself. He gathered his pupils around him for an 
announcement: &quot;I regret to inform you all that I shall be sojourning to 
the football field shortly, so that I may see the results of this last 
practice game. As some of you may know, I have a bit of an interest in 
it and I&#39;d very much like to see it through. Therefore, I will be 
leaving shortly; I estimate my return in about one hour. I will leave 
Wilkinson in charge until then, so please treat his instructions with 
the same respect as you would treat mine. Since some of you share my 
same curiosity,&quot; he added, glancing at Rain, &quot;you may observe this game 
in the private, just so long as you promptly return to this spot for the 
remaining matches. You will be facing Lovelace next, and I am confident 
you will make me proud. Show me what magnificence is.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir!&quot; He strolled away briskly and was on the road in minutes. 
Rain felt an enormous weight roll off her shoulders. Now was her chance! 
She could sneak away and nobody would notice! Screw the matches, she 
wanted to watch Carnegie- for it might be the last time they ever 
played. But then she got a look at who she was going up against next, 
and her jaw dropped to the floor.

The roster read, &quot;Howlet vs. Tran-Yi&quot;, and a search for her opponent 
showed that she would be facing the woman who had comforted her in the 
weight room. Ancelin Yi. Two-time national fencing champion. The glory 
Rain had been seeking all her life was right within her grasp. The 
moment of truth had finally come at last. Dies Fatali, the Day of Fate. 
She could do it. She could feel it. The title of Nation&#39;s Best was 
within her reach. If she could face Ancelin, and beat her- she could do 
it, couldn&#39;t she? Fitzgerald had taught her well! This is what she had 
been living for!!- if she could do all that, she would have everything 
she had ever wanted. If she stayed here, ignoring one desire for 
another...

But oh, how those doors beckoned her.
