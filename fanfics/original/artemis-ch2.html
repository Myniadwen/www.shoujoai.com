<a href="../original/artemis-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Jasmine paused before the full length mirror, pushing her long 
violet hair back from her face with a white gloved hand. Her tanned skin 
glowed with health, the purple dress that she wore hugging her 
generously proportioned body. Her eyes shone blue as she smiled, white 
teeth flashing in the dim light as she turned away from the mirrored 
glass.

        The door bell rang, almost on cue, and Jasmine walked over to 
answer it. The young woman out in the hallway smiled, her short red hair 
falling into eyes that were the most vivid shade of forest green. 
&quot;Jasmine,&quot; she smiled a bit shyly, &quot;I&#39;m Alex Conner.&quot;

        &quot;Good evening,&quot; Jasmine smiled as she took a half step forward, 
gently pressing her lips to the startled woman&#39;s cheek.

        Alex blushed, looking down to try and recover her composure. She 
hesitated before offering the bouquet of flowers, &quot;These are for you.&quot;

        Jasmine took the flowers, bringing them to her nose to take in 
the gentle mix of scents, the different flowers arranged to look lovely. 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jasmine said. She stepped back and waved Alex inside, &quot;Come 
in while I find a vase for these.&quot;

        Alex followed her inside, nervously tugging on her overcoat. The 
suit she had chosen had been custom tailored, a old fashioned black with 
white shirt. &quot;This suite is lovely,&quot; Alex commented, looking around at 
the almost decadently decorated room.

        &quot;It&#39;s a loaner,&quot; Jasmine carefully set the flowers into a fine 
vase, &quot;but thank you.&quot; She looked over at Alex thoughtfully, &quot;Did you 
have any plans for the evening?&quot;

        &quot;Not really,&quot; Alex admitted sheepishly. At Jasmine&#39;s questioning 
look she continued, &quot;My friends kind of sprung this on me a few hours 
ago in honor of my promotion.&quot;

        Jasmine walked back to where Alex stood, looking up at her with 
a impish little smile. &quot;Your friends neglected to tell me that Alex was 
going to be a woman,&quot; she said to her softly, &quot;I guess that we both had 
a surprise.&quot;

        &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind....&quot; Alex started.

        Jasmine reached up and put a gentle finger to Alex&#39;s lips to 
silence her. She smiled warmly as she said, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; She gently 
pulled Alex down and kissed her strongly, wrapping her arms around the 
taller woman&#39;s neck.

        &quot;wow,&quot; Alex managed softly as Jasmine drew back.

        Jasmine rested against Alex, the two women standing there 
closely as Alex unconsciously wrapped her arms around the smaller woman. 
&quot;I&#39;d really like to just take you back to the bedroom,&quot; she cooed, &quot;but 
we&#39;re both dressed up for a night on the town. And I think I&#39;d like to 
be seen out with a handsome butch like you.&quot;

        &quot;Considering my friends rented me a fancy car, too,&quot; Alex said, 
blushing at the handsome comment, &quot;we might as well get some use out of 
it.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;And I think being seen with a gorgeous woman like 
you would be great.&quot;

        The two walked out of the high-class apartment and down the 
hall, Jasmine with her hand resting on Alex&#39;s arm. They talked softly as 
they descended to the street, stepping out of the elevator and walking 
out of the front door.

        Jasmine smiled as Alex led her to the black sports car. &quot;Next 
time just let your date believe it&#39;s your car,&quot; she scolded gently, 
&quot;it&#39;s more impressive.&quot;

        &quot;Not my style,&quot; Alex held open the door for her, receiving a 
sunny smile from Jasmine in return. As she went around to the driver&#39;s 
side she continued, &quot;My regular car&#39;s a bit older but it works out well 
for my job.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re honest,&quot; Jasmine noted as Alex climbed in the car, 
giving the woman another of her warm smiles, &quot;I like that.&quot;

        &quot;Nah,&quot; Alex answered as she started up the car, the engine 
producing a deep, throaty purr, &quot;I&#39;m just a really bad liar.&quot;

        Jasmine chuckled softly. &quot;Do you have someplace in mind,&quot; she 
asked curiously, &quot;or would you accept a suggestion?&quot;

        &quot;As I have never done this before,&quot; Alex tossed her a smile, 
&quot;I&#39;d love a suggestion.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s this club I know of....&quot; Jasmine smiled.

        ************

        Alex smoothly pulled the sleek car up to the unmarked building 
Jasmine directed her to, quickly going around to open the door for her 
companion. &quot;You really are a gentleman,&quot; Jasmine noted, smiling as Alex 
gently pulled her up to her feet.

        &quot;Suppose so,&quot; Alex agreed. She looked at the Victorian style 
house curiously and asked, &quot;There&#39;s a restaurant in there?&quot;

        &quot;Private club,&quot; Jasmine answered, leading her up the walkway. 
They were met at the door by a tough looking blonde who nodded in 
recognition to Jasmine and opened a inner door.

        &quot;Bouncer?&quot; Alex blinked.

        &quot;If you aren&#39;t a member or know a member,&quot; Jasmine answered 
serenely as they entered a crowded room, &quot;you don&#39;t get in.&quot;

        Alex&#39;s eyes widened as she saw the back wall, a massive mural 
painted on it. The woman stood in the middle of a forest, drawing a 
longbow back smoothly, her slim athletic body scarred and battered by 
many battles. Still she was beautiful, a warrior that was facing her 
enemies with strength and courage. Just below the image a simple line of 
text read, &#39;The Daughters of Artemis.&#39;

        &quot;Daughters of Artemis?&quot; Alex repeated questioningly.

        &quot;The club&#39;s name,&quot; Jasmine agreed, &quot;it&#39;s been around for years, 
I&#39;ve heard.&quot;

        As they weaved through the tables to the bar itself Alex nearly 
froze as she recognized a familiar face. Jess Drake sat at a table, 
talking intently with another young woman. The two of them were an odd 
couple, the tough Jess sitting with the elegant looking lady but somehow 
they fit. Jess looked up at her and smiled slightly, then returned to 
her conversation.

        &quot;You know Jess Drake?&quot; Jasmine asked, a bit of surprise in her 
voice.

        &quot;Worked with her once,&quot; Alex admitted as they reached the bar, a 
blonde haired woman handling orders easily.

        &quot;Jazz,&quot; the woman smiled, &quot;haven&#39;t seen you around for a bit. 
Friend of yours?&quot;

        &quot;My date,&quot; Jasmine tossed Alex a smile before saying, &quot;Alex, I&#39;d 
like you to meet Circe, she runs this place with her partner, Diana.&quot;

        &quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Alex smiled back nervously.

        &quot;So what can I get you two?&quot; Circe asked them warmly.

        &quot;Tonic water,&quot; Jasmine said simply, looking over at Alex 
curiously.

        Alex blinked then ordered a soda. Circe raised an eyebrow but 
delivered the drinks quickly, leaving when she was hailed by a customer 
at the other end of the bar. &quot;No alcohol?&quot; Alex asked Jasmine the 
question softly.

        &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Jasmine answered simply. She looked up at Alex a 
moment, weighing her silently, then asked, &quot;When you were working with 
Jess, was it one of her more.... unusual jobs?&quot;

        Alex blinked, then she said, &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

        Jasmine took a drink, putting her glass down with a soft thump. 
For the first time that evening she looked nervous as she said, &quot;You 
see, I&#39;m not quite... normal.&quot; She looked up at Alex, &quot;Nothing bad, but 
I thought you should know.&quot;

        Alex took a drink of her own glass, stalling for time. She was 
remarkably comfortable with Jasmine, more so than she had really 
expected. In all honesty she had been dreading this night out her 
friends had sprung on her, and meeting Jasmine had saved the night.

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Alex smiled down at her, putting her hand over 
Jasmine&#39;s gently.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Jasmine brought their lips together for another 
kiss. This time she opened her mouth slightly, letting her tongue slip 
into Alex&#39;s mouth.

        &#39;Pointed,&#39; Alex thought in surprise as the tongue dueled with 
hers. Jasmine slid back, smiling up at her with a mischievous look on 
her face, waiting to hear what she was going to say. &quot;I wonder how that 
feels,&quot; Alex found herself saying.

        Jasmine cheeks colored slightly, then she laughed softly. &quot;I 
think you&#39;ll be finding out personally,&quot; she answered with a purr.

        Alex&#39;s face went beet red.</pre>
