<p><strong> Justice? <br />
  <br />
  </strong>The doorbell rang as Kris was in the midst of getting dressed for   school. Her dark blue jeans were only at her knees, and her white dress   shirt was completely unbuttoned. She quickly hauled up her pants, neglecting   to button, or zip them up for the time being. She was the only one home   at this hour in the morning, and opening the door for her sudden visitor   was her responsibility.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Coming!&quot; She yelled down the stairs as she half ran, half   hopped out of her room, holding up her pants with one hand, and attempting   to button her shirt with the other. By the time she got to the door   she had managed to get the middle button on her shirt done up, so that   she wouldn't be <em>completely </em>exposed to her guest.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris opened the door to find a small, shy, blushing Melanie.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Hey.&quot; Kris said nonchalantly, not noticing the scarlet blush   on the other girl's face. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Um… Hi.&quot; Melanie replied, looking away from Kris, to her   feet. &quot;Uh… Your shirt.&quot; She said, clearing her throat. <br />
  <br />
  Kris stared at Melanie for a moment, unsure of what the smaller girl   was talking about. Kris blushed lightly and looked down at herself,   remembering her state of undress. Kris rarely wore a bra, on account   of her chest being quite small, so her breasts were clearly visible.   Kris' face turned bright red at the realization that Melanie had seen   her bare chest. <br />
  &quot;S-sorry.&quot; Kris stammered while fiddling with the buttons   on her shirt. &quot;I didn't realize...&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Melanie fought to keep her gaze away from Kris' body, only giving in   to steal small, subtle glances, then quickly looking back down at her   feet. She nodded at the taller girl in front of her. &quot;I-It's alright…&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris hurriedly finished dressing, and slipped on her shoes before grabbing   her backpack and exiting her home. The walk to the bus stop was a quiet   one, as both girls were still quite embarrassed about the earlier exposure   on Kris' part.  <br />
  <br />
  The silence lasted through the bus ride to school, and until they gave   short farewells, and promises to see each other on the bus ride home   before parting.  <br />
  <br />
  It was the middle of second period, History, and Kris was still mentally   beating herself up because of her carelessness earlier that morning.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Why didn't I wear a bloody bra today?&quot; She grumbled before   hitting her head off the desk, making a loud bang that attracted the   attention of everyone in class.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Mrs. Sawyer, is there a problem?&quot; The teacher, Mrs. Baxendale   asked, raising an eyebrow at the young teen.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Nope. Nothing.&quot; Kris replied, her head still down on the   desk so her voice was muffled. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Well, I'd like an apology, for disrupting the class, Kristen.&quot;   The teacher said, her voice was serious; along with everything else   about her.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris lifted her head up off the desk and looked at the Mrs. Baxendale.   &quot;I'm sorry that your lectures are so boring, but I real-&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Kristen!&quot; Mrs. Baxendale growled, cutting her off. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I'd like an apology, for disrupting my apology.&quot; Kris replied,   a smirk playing on her lips.  <br />
  <br />
  The classroom erupted in giggles at the boyish girl's boldness, but   soon was hushed from the acidic gaze that the classroom's authority   was giving them.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;I will do no such thing. Now settle down, or I <em>will</em> send   you to the office, young lady.&quot; The  teacher replied, angered   by Kris' attitude.  <br />
  <br />
  Kris shrugged off the threat and stretched, letting out a loud yawn   that made her classmates burst into giggles again. Mrs. Baxendale merely   grunted and returned to her lecture. Kris decided to leave the poor   old lady alone for the rest of the class; she had much more important   things on her mind, after all.  <br />
  <br />
  ******************************************* <br />
  <br />
  Kris was in the middle of playing a random violent video game she had   picked up at the local gaming store when she heard the doorbell ring.   It was unusual for her to have visitors at this time of night - it was   10:30pm - so Kris was slightly curious to find out who it might be.   She cautiously got up from the couch and walked out to the door. She   looked out through the frosted glass, hoping that she could recognize   the silhouette on the opposite side of the door. The person appeared   to be female, and around the same height as Kris, so she knew it wasn't   an adult. She slowly opened the door and peered out. To her surprise,   she found a young girl with wavy blonde hair that reached the small   of her back, clear, fair skin, and piercing green eyes.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Cassie..?&quot; Kris asked, confused as to why the girl she had   saved from who-knows-what just a week ago was on her doorstep. At 10:30   in the night, none the less.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Erm… I'm sorry to be bothering you at this time of night…&quot;   The girl said as she took a small folded piece of cloth from behind   her back, and held it out to Kris. &quot;I thought you might want your   shirt back.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris smiled and took the shirt from Cassie. &quot;Thanks. But you didn't   have to come all this way, especially at this time of night. Um… Do   you want to come in for a bit for some hot chocolate? It's pretty cold   out…&quot;  <br />
</p>
<p>Cassie nodded and sheepishly followed   Kris inside.</p>
<p>The two girls sat down on the couch   timidly, holding their steaming glasses of hot chocolate. Kris took   a sip of her hot chocolate while she took a furtive glance over at the   beautiful blonde next to her. Cassie seemed to be off in her own world   as she stared at the blank television screen in front of them.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Um… So, how are things?&quot; Kris asked, wanting to break the   awkward silence between them more than anything.  <br />
  <br />
  Cassie snapped back into reality and shook her head lightly before replying.   &quot;Good, I suppose…&quot; She muttered back. <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Oh.&quot; Kris replied, looking down at the brown liquid that   was occupying the mug in her hand. &quot;Whatever happened to that guy   from last week?&quot; She asked, trying not to make the other girl too   uncomfortable.  <br />
  <br />
  &quot;Oh… Ryan… He…&quot; She started, clenching the mug in her   hand tightly. &quot;Nothing… He got off… But he hasn't tried anything   else… So that's good… Right?&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris looked up from her mug, to Cassie, a flash of anger showing in   her eyes. &quot;He got off with that?! That fucking pig did that to   you, and got off?!&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Cassie nodded her head and sighed. &quot;No one believes me. Ryan is   the quarterback on my school's football team… The star player. No   one would believe that he would do that sort of thing. It's stupid,   I know… But at least he's leaving me alone, for the time being.&quot;  <br />
  <br />
  Kris clenched her teeth in anger and shook her head. &quot;I'll get   back at him… I swear I will…&quot;  </p>
