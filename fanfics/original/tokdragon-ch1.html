Tswana Rock, Botswana, Africa

&#147;Put your backs into it men! We only have half an hour before the night 
patrol reaches here! I want our mission completed before then!&#148;

The beauty of African jungles was really beyond compare. Herds of 
elegant herbivores bounded into the background, amid the thick trees and 
bushes, to graze on their beloved fauna for a late night meal. Birds 
flew from above, crying into the night, flapping toward a heartless moon 
that gave light only to those considered nocturnal. But once the harsh 
sound of drilling entered that realm, the gentle animals ran from fear, 
darting back into the tall grasses from which they had emerged. Huge, 
towering drill machines stomped through the beautiful night scenery, 
adorned with burly armed soldiers, all eastern and Caucasian in descent. 
Once the drill machines passed through the thicket of the jungle, they 
broke into a clearing, a clearing of sheared grass (obviously a man-made 
venture, though not necessarily by these people). The clearing had only 
a few spectacles within it, that being the mighty Tswana Rock, and 
soldiers mining there way beneath it. 

Tswana Rock was a symbol of pride for all those so spoke the language of 
Tswana. Erected in 234BC, it was assumed by the Tswana-speaking people 
that their ancestors had built and sculpted the enormous rock with the 
aid of their respective tribal gods. It is also said that people from 
surrounding villages paid homage to Tswana Rock everyday, in the hopes 
of appeasing the gods and earning their favour for harvests and the 
future to come. But in the wake of modernization and the rise of 
machinery, the people indigenous to this land had abandoned these sacred 
beliefs to mingle with the rapidly changing world. The year was 1994. 
Many changes were taking place in the society of the world. It was only 
natural for Botswana and its people to follow along. In the midst of all 
this change, Tswana Rock had been abandoned. No longer a hub for worship 
to supposed gods, it was now just a ground for brave tourists to visit 
and marvel at. But, had the Tswana-speaking people known the true 
purpose of Tswana Rock, they might have defended it to the bitter end. 

The soldiers were swathed in green and brown combat attire, with a 
symbol on the backs of their uniforms. To most people, they knew not of 
its meaning, but that symbol represented a company most dangerous in the 
world today. A corporation called the KAIGA Group Those soldiers 
scrambled from the drilling machines and surrounded a hole that had been 
created in front of Tswana Rock previously. The hole was actually a 
mineshaft, 2x2 meters wide, and trailing down for a great distance. So 
great that it was impossible to see the bottom of the shaft. 

After the six soldiers surrounding the mineshaft opening readied 
themselves, they looked over to the mission leader, who was 
differentiated only by the medals on his lapel 

&#147;Now men!&#148; He yelled. &#147;Down there is what we&#146;ve been searching for! Mr. 
Schwarzluft is relying on us to bring it to him. The previous squad has 
created the shaft for us All we have to do is go down there and get it. 
Right?&#148;

The soldiers all nodded. One by one, they jumped into the mineshaft and 
picked their way downwards via the ladder attached to the muddy wall. 
They climbed down further and further, losing contact with the little 
light supplied by the moon. The journey to the innards of Tswana Rock 
took many minutes, but eventually the squadron reached the bottom. A 
moment emphasized by the sound of a boot scraping solid stone. The 
soldiers all came down from the ladder and turned on their flashlights. 
It was amazing down there. Beams of light flashed and revealed stone 
walls along with stone floors, scripted with symbols and pictures far 
different from those etched onto the surface of the upper Tswana Rock. 
These weren&#146;t even African in origin It was obvious to these soldiers 
that these symbols had their roots from Japan, which was plain to them 
because those soldiers themselves were Japanese. But even though they 
knew of this, they still had no idea what those symbols meant.

The six soldiers marched forward into the small opening into the Tswana 
Rock, crawling through it until they reached an area that was more than 
large enough to contain their presence in full. They all poured out of 
that tunnel into a huge chamber, which they suspected to be directly 
beneath the Tswana Rock. But that was not their concern. Their concern 
was the item in the centre of that huge room. Topped on a pyre of stone, 
was a rock. But it was no ordinary rock. It was immaculately shaped into 
the form of an egg, smooth and polished, beaming with a pure white glow. 

One of the six soldiers of the squadron stepped forward and smiled 
deviously. The efforts of his team had been met. &#147;We&#146;ve done it We&#146;ve 
found the Stone Egg.&#148;

Asagawa Training Facility, Tokyo, Japan 

&#147;Whoo. That was a workout.&#148;

With a sigh, Yoko flopped to her knees, spread out her hands and 
relaxed. She had been working out so much of her tension on that 
training dummy. You could see how battered it was by the punch marks and 
dents that had been chipped and hammered into the material  She hadn&#146;t 
been this sore and maxed-out since her training battle with her brother, 
Ryo, last year. Still, it made her wonder, just how was he doing out 
there?

Yoko leaned backwards till her back hit the cold stone of the Asagawa 
Family&#146;s training grounds. The stone clearing of this part was huge. A 
good twenty meters wide by fifty meters long. Perfect for training large 
amounts of people. Of course, only Yoko was practicing today. For now, 
she was the only fighter taking an active role in the Asagawa Training 
grounds. And being that she was of Asagawa blood herself, daughter of 
fighting legend Tsukasa Asagawa, she had quite the role to fulfil here. 

Yoko wiped the sweat from her face and forehead, gently scraping against 
the raven black of her bangs. Her dark hair itself was matted with 
sweat. Hard work was proving to be more of a stress on her, but it 
served her well. Seeing Yoko on the fighting level would prove that. 

As Yoko lay on the stone ground, spread eagled, her marble black eyes 
looked up at the sky, and old man walked in from one of the surrounding 
buildings. He slid the door open, and presented himself. Like Yoko, he 
was dressed in a white fighting Gi, contrasted only by a black belt at 
the waist. But unlike Yoko, he was aged and slow. The leathery face of 
the old teacher scooted over to look at a dozy Yoko.

&#147;Slacking off again, Yoko?&#148; The aged man spoke in his shrivelled voice, 
&#147;You and your brother are just alike Rest is the only thing you&#146;ll take 
on board.&#148;

Yoko smiled, leaning upward. &#147;Grandfather. Sorry. I&#146;m just a little bit 
pooped. I haven&#146;t worked so hard in ages Ryo hardly ever does any work. 
That&#146;s the difference between me and him. I just put in that little bit 
extra.&#148;

The adoptive grandfather of Yoko, Nobuo Ishizuka, smiled to himself as 
he looked upon his granddaughter She really was more of an effort-maker 
than Ryo was. But that was the kind of person that Yoko was. Even at the 
tender age of 17, she was determined, intelligent, kind, bright and 
dedicated. It pleased Nobuo to know that he had been taking good care of 
her for the past few years. Tsukasa Asagawa, Yoko&#146;s biological father, 
would demand nothing less. It was Tsukasa&#146;s dying wish that both Yoko 
and Ryo be taught in the ways of the Asagawa-style, three years ago. 
Tsukasa had died in the multi-cultural town of Sunset City, and had been 
raising Ryo and Yoko as best he could (without their mother, who had 
disappeared shortly after Yoko&#146;s birth). When he died, he left both Yoko 
and Ryo in Nobuo&#146;s care. Nobuo had trained them both in the 
Asagawa-style (which he and Tsukasa had both learned that style from 
Sousuke Asagawa, Yoko&#146;s biological grandfather). But while Ryo left to 
go see more of the world, Yoko stayed behind to learn more of the 
Asagawa style. And she had been coming along nicely. Nobuo was very 
pleased with Yoko&#146;s progress. He believed that she was even becoming 
stronger than he was. 

Nobuo continued hobbling over to Yoko, then withdrew two letters from 
his Gi. Both of them he presented to Yoko. &#147;Here.&#148;

Yoko stood upright. &#147;Letters?&#148;

&#147;Yes. Both for you. Which is strange, because you don&#146;t get much mail 
here, do you?&#148;

Yoko shook her head, staring at the letters. &#147;No. I don&#146;t. I wonder who 
is mailing me?&#148;

Well, she wasn&#146;t going to waste more of her time wondering. Yoko ripped 
open the envelope of one of the letters, then pulled out the letter from 
the inside Her dark marble eyes stalked over the letter, back and forth, 
until she realized who had mailed this to her. 

&#147;It&#146;s from Ryo!&#148; Yoko said eagerly, just before she read it aloud. &#147;Hey, 
Yoko and Grandpa Nobuo Sorry I haven&#146;t gotten in touch recently, I&#146;ve 
been busy with a whole bunch of stuff, mostly chicks, but then you guys 
wouldn&#146;t really approve of that, would ya?&#148;

Nobuo coughed into his fist before Yoko continued reading. &#147;I&#146;m just 
mailing you guys to tell you that I&#146;m heading back to Sunset City. It&#146;s 
been three years, and I know pops died there, but I feel that it&#146;s time. 
I&#146;m going to meet up with some of my old friends and see what&#146;s 
happening there. Once I get the low down, I&#146;ll tell you how it went. 
Later!&#148;

Yoko slowly put the letter back in the torn envelope. &#147;So he&#146;s going 
back to Sunset City. It seems so long ago that father was killed. Do you 
think he is going there for revenge?&#148;

Nobuo shook his head. &#147;I don&#146;t think so. Ryo really isn&#146;t the type. 
Besides, we don&#146;t know who killed you father. He is probably true to his 
word and just wants to see his friends. You remember how close he was 
with that bunch.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Yeah.&#148; Yoko did remember that. Ryo had a close bunch of friends. That 
American guy, Kayde, his English bar-owner friend, Jahn, and that 
Chinese girl who he so obviously loved, Yun-Yun. At times, Yoko felt 
jealous of the time that Ryo spent with them. Even now, she resented the 
fact that she saw so little of her brother.

&#147;What about the other letter?&#148; Nobuo asked.

Yoko snapped out of her thoughts and remembered that she had a second 
letter. The young girl tucked Ryo&#146;s letter under her arm and then opened 
the other letter. She pulled out the loose leaf of paper inside, and 
began reading, only this time she did not read aloud. Nobuo watched 
Yoko&#146;s eyes monitor the letter and grew curious at the surprised look 
that Yoko suddenly beamed

&#147;What does it say?&#148;

Yoko looked at Nobuo. &#147;It&#146;s an invitation to a martial arts competition. 
The God of Fighting Grand Championships&#133;&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Xiangdong Gravesite, Beijing, China

&#147;Mother, Father. I know it has been a long time since I visited you. I 
am sorry for that. But I have my reasons. And I know the truth. I know 
about everything you tried to keep from me. I know about the Eight 
Children of Gaia.&#148;

Li Ming lowered her head, her knees tucked underneath her body and her 
beautiful amethyst eyes locked shut. She sat kneeling before two graves. 
One for both of her parents, buried next to each other. The young girl 
felt a tear slip down her face, but did not think much of it. She had 
come to terms with the death of her mother and father. But what she had 
not come to terms with were the circumstances behind her parent&#146;s 
deaths. It had all just recently come to her. Even now, in the middle of 
the cold morning, surrounded by the hundreds of tombstones belonging to 
other deceased, Li Ming could only focus on the tragedy of her past. 
About that day, twelve years ago. Li Ming was only six when it happened, 
but she could remember it all. The fog-like smoke that made her eyes 
water. The screams of her parents, and the singeing heat of the 
swallowing fire. It was miracle that she had survived It was even more 
of a miracle she that had escaped it all without a scratch on her. That 
was a mystery if ever there was one.

Li Ming continued on. &#147;I also know that I am one of them. And if I had 
not have pressed Uncle about it, I might never have known. Why didn&#146;t 
you tell me? Why can you not tell me now? Why is there so much of my 
past that I do not understand?&#148;

The Chinese girl opened her eyes and looked up into the sky. Even in 
this bright morning, the sun smiling and the clouds bright, the mood of 
this graveyard brought that happiness to a halt. And made Li Ming&#146;s 
demeanour follow that exact same path. 

&#147;Tell me!&#148; She screamed, so loud that the caretakers of the graveyard 
could hear her. &#147;Why did you keep these secrets from me?! Why did you 
die like that? Before I had a chance to learn? Why&#133; can&#146;t you be here 
now&#133; when I need you the most&#133;?&#148;

The girl lowered her head again, looking away from the sky. In truth, 
she knew why her parents were dead. And she knew by whose hand this deed 
had been committed. She was wearing a standard red and black Chinese 
dress, split at the waist, but beneath it, was a letter. The letter was 
strapped to her leg via a leg-band, but she knew full well what the 
contents of that envelope were. It seemed like nothing, but in 
actuality, it held a great significance to Li Ming. It was her ultimate 
chance to discover her past. 

&#147;The KAIGA Group.&#148; Li Ming mouthed. &#147;It was them who did this. They were 
the ones who took you from me. I swear, I&#146;ll make them pay for this. I 
know that I am one of the Children of Gaia. And I do not pretend to know 
what that means; but I do know that it is something that can help me 
against the KAIGA Group. Please, Mother and Father. Give me the strength 
to fight them. Give me the strength to find out my past&#133; and who I am&#133;&#148;

Dead-End Nightclub, Nagoya, Japan

The Dead-End Nightclub. A place that stayed true to its name. Because 
only the dregs of society clamoured to this place. Though the partygoers 
seemed happy enough, their drunkard dancing and ill-fated actions 
presenting this, the illusion was not hidden. This was the place that 
people came to drown their sorrows. Maybe because they had lost their 
jobs, or because they had been beaten up recently or were even being 
threatened by an overzealous crime lord, it didn&#146;t matter. This was the 
place the underworld of Nagoya clung to for support. You needed cheap 
booze, you came to Dead-End. You needed hush-hush narcotics, you came to 
Dead-End. The owner, a rather gormless and petty money launderer called 
Mukasa, was more than happy to cater to the needs of the needy. For a 
price. Once you gave all you had, it was then that the more violent side 
of this place was shown. For example, if a man had scammed some Class-A 
drugs from a dealer in Dead-End, and he couldn&#146;t pay for them, the hired 
muscle would make an appearance. And this need was not an exaggeration. 
For long years, Dead-End had been seen as a hub of drug use. There were 
those who tried to scam the system so delicately crafted by Dead-End&#146;s 
owner, and there were also those who were hired to correct those foolish 
errors in judgement. 

With their fists, the majority of the time.

A dishevelled and malnourished man clumsily ran down a back street, just 
off the side of the Dead-End nightclub. He ran for his life, as hard as 
he could, but reached nowhere It was a dead end. How fitting. The 
frightened man turned around, his shoes splashing in the puddles of rain 
that had been coming down in the nightly downpour. Far to the end of the 
alley was a tall, strapping young man, seemingly unique from such a 
blasted place. His stride was excellent, boasting strong yet lithe 
muscles and a cunning cultivated by years of smashing in faces. He was 
dressed in a semi-formal black suit, his spiky silver glimmering in the 
moonlight. Along with the stern gold of his eyes. His face was neutral. 
His intention here was obvious, but he was unaffected by them. This was 
just work. Work. 

The young boy, who would have been no more than 21 years of age, stepped 
up to the snivelling man, his icy gaze piercing a hole of fear into the 
older guy. Today&#146;s youth were far more than intimidating. 

&#147;So,&#148; The silver-haired boy began, &#147;Have you got the money?&#148;

The man trembled &#147;L-Look, can&#146;t you just tell Mukasa that I&#146;ll p-pay him 
a-another day? I-I swear I&#146;ll have a-all the c-cash by tomorrow!&#148;

&#147;That wasn&#146;t what I asked you. So I&#146;ll say it again.&#148; The boy lunged 
forward, his hand latching onto the shaking man&#146;s collar. &#147;Do you have 
the money?&#148;

The man slowly shook his head as a no. They both knew what that would 
mean. The drug user cramped his eyes shut as the boy drew back his fist. 
And what a feeling of pain when the first punch was delivered. The older 
man, cried out, as his jaw was snapped with one clear striking left 
hook. The silver-haired boy did not relent at that call of agony, nor 
did he relish it, rather, he continued on, lacking the emotion that so 
many others would have had. He smashed his fist into the face and 
stomach of the druggie, until his facial features became hard to 
determine. In minutes of repeated punching, his face became nothing more 
than a crimson mass, blood oozing, bruises adorning, bones shattering, 
and teeth being beaten loose. One final punch and the drug user was 
unconscious, falling like a lump into one of the many puddles dotted 
along the dark alley. Blood ran down from his face like water. But 
still, the silver-haired boy remained calm, cool, and collected, as if 
inflicting such a brutality did not effect him. 

It didn&#146;t matter to him. Not anymore. This was just business. And 
business, as they say, is business. He idly kicked the beaten man over, 
to inspect the damage From years of doing this exact same thing, the boy 
had come to recognize the kind of damage he could do. By the looks of 
things, there wasn&#146;t much to worry about. Quite a bit of blood, ten or 
so bruises, a busted lip and most definitely a broken nose, but that was 
all. His boss, Mukasa, would be pleased that this all went so well. Just 
as the silver-haired boy turned to leave, he noticed something on his 
right. A man. 

A very curious man. He wasn&#146;t much to look at, his hair was tousled, his 
clothes dirty and his disposition lazy, but all the same, somehow 
interesting. The boy tried to shake off this feeling and kept walking, 
until that man spoke to him. 

&#147;What a waste of your powers. Beating the stuffing out of a poor man who 
has been dragged into a web of corruption. Such a waste.&#148;

The boy halted &#147;It&#146;s nothing personal. Just work. I don&#146;t take pleasure 
in it.&#148;

&#147;I see,&#148; The haggard-looking man replied, &#147;What is your name, boy?&#148;

&#147;I have no name.&#148; He replied. &#147;But people have come to regard me as 
Xiangau.&#148;

The worn-out spectator grinned. &#147;Xiangau, huh? What would your parents 
say if they knew what you got up to at night?&#148;

Xiangau closed his eyes. &#147;I have no parents.&#148;

&#147;Everyone has parents. Deceased or not. I think you see that misguidance 
as an excuse to waste your time in filthy dives like Dead-End. Using 
this miserable place as a distraction from your destiny.&#148;

Xiangau turned back, to look at the man. &#147;What do you know of me? 
Nothing. I have no destiny. This is my life. My power has only one 
purpose now. If that means my hands are stained with blood, then so be 
it. I care not for fools who would sell their souls to drug use. Nor do 
I care for people who interfere in my affairs&#148;

That smile of the sneak stranger developed. &#147;Ah! I see there is some 
passion in that icy shell of yours. Very good. It is fitting that you 
show some of it. Because, I know that soon enough, you will regard your 
strength as something more than a means to an end.&#148;

&#147;What are you trying to say?&#148; Xiangau asked.

The fatigued man stood up from the trash can he was sitting on, walked 
to Xiangau slowly, then handed him something. A piece of paper. 

&#147;You belong to a great heritage.&#148; The man spoke to Xiangau. &#147;You might 
not understand that now, or even what that means, but you will, 
eventually. You must come to learn about yourself. And you can start by 
participating in that.&#148;

Xiangau looked down to the piece of paper. &#147;What is this?&#148;

&#147;An invitation to a tournament, sponsored by the KAIGA Group. Your 
powers must no longer be wasted in this place. You can enter that 
tournament for pride, ambition, money, or whatever it is that you wish. 
Just make sure that you enter it. You might be surprised with what you 
find, Xiangau.&#148;

Xiangau looked up from the note, then to the man. There was something in 
his eye that made him distrustful of this. Something about this man&#146;s 
words seemed too&#133; convenient. But whatever that feeling was, he pushed 
it aside, and followed nothing more than his own instincts. Xiangau 
stuffed the note into the pockets of his suit, then walked away from the 
man whom had presented him with it. 

Though it seemed like no conclusion had been found, they both knew that 
Xiangau was going to enter that tournament. But for what reason? That, 
it seemed, remained to be seen.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kawaguchi Building, Shinjuku-Tokyo, Japan 

&#147;Everything is going smoothly, Mr. Schwarzluft. All 32 tournament 
invitations have been sent out, through mail, e-mail and personal 
couriers. The costs for the multiple flight arrangements is at an 
estimated total of 21,000 US dollars. But due to the extra reserves of 
this years budget, this little issue is&#133; less of an issue.&#148;

Reinhalt Schwarzluft.  Quite a man. Tall, proud, and devious, he stood 
before the window facing the massive Shinjuku streets. Buzzing with 
consumers and cars, zooming to individual destinations. And though the 
Japanese branch of the KAIGA Group had much to offer, he hated it here 
with a passion.

&#147;I cannot wait to be back in Germany.&#148; He said, pulling some of his long 
blonde hair away from his eyes. &#147;This puny island is annoying me.&#148;

The receptionist who had been speaking details to Reinhalt, continued. 
&#147;We can also up the revenue of this year&#146;s tournament by allowing it to 
go public, but with the plan you have made&#133;&#148;

Reinhalt looked back. &#147;None of the public must ever see what will take 
place at Kakuri Isle. I thought I made that clear to you, and the rest 
of the Japanese branch. We need absolute security and seclusion for 
this. I expect nothing less than that.&#148;

&#147;Forgive me. It was simply a suggestion, sir.&#148; She replied. 

&#147;I have no need for your suggestions.&#148; Reinhalt argued &#147;Continue with 
your report.&#148;

The receptionist looked back down to her clipboard. &#147;The search force 
that had been sent to retrieve the Stone Egg, had completed their 
mission by midnight of yesterday. The item is ready to be transported to 
Kakuri Isle and to be inspected by the science department there.&#148;

Reinhalt smiled, turning back to the window. &#147;Excellent. Continue.&#148;

&#147;It is about all I have to report. However, the tournament will begin in 
four days, and I have been told that some of the doctors on Kakuri Isle 
will like to speak with you about the outline for use of the Stone Egg. 
They believe that in the schedule that they have, they will not be able 
to complete a full analysis for it in time for the tournament.&#148;

&#147;Blasted white-coats!&#148; Reinhalt yelled angrily. &#147;Always procrastinating 
in the most critical of times with their &#145;caution&#146;. We cannot delay the 
tournament any longer than we have. The tournament invitations have 
already been sent out. Just have the Stone Egg shipped over to Kakuri 
Isle as quickly as possible. Whether they complete the tests or not, it 
will not change my plans. The project will go as planned, without any 
more setbacks. Is that clear?&#148;

The receptionist nodded, a little fear in her voice. &#147;Y-Yes sir.&#148;

&#147;Good,&#148; He replied, this time more calmly. &#147;Now be gone. I need a moment 
to think.&#148;

After nodding in acceptance of that, the receptionist girl quickly left 
the room to take care of her business. Reinhalt on the other hand, he 
slowly walked over to his desk and took a seat on his cushioned chair. 
The realization of his plans was coming together, but ever so gradually. 
It had taken nearly fourteen years to find the Stone Egg, but at last it 
had happened. Once the tournament took place in four days time, 
everything he had worked for would be legitimised. All it was now, was a 
matter of waiting. Waiting for the designated time. Reinhalt leaned back 
on the hair, shook his wavy blonde hair, and closed his eyes. For a man 
of  41-years of age, he was very active. Though it might not have seemed 
like it. But all he had left to do was wait. Then everything he had 
struggled for would be at his hand.
