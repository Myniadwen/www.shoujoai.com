The Sixth Orochi 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Room of Fates, Inside the Shinrin Jinja

&quot;...It&#39;s been seven long years...&quot; Hirotsugu spoke, &quot;...Welcome 
back, Mizuryu Yui...&quot;

Shiki scowled, seething. &quot;...Father...&quot;

Seven whole years since their last meeting. It was no surprise 
that this meeting was just as frosty and as chilling as the 
last.  How many times had Shiki pictured this in her mind? 
Seeing the older man. Her Father. Hearing him breathe. Watching 
him speak. Shiki had waited for this moment for too long. But 
now it was finally here. She was face to face with Hirotsugu. 
The Honshu Koga. The true ruler of the Island of Honshu, leader 
of the Mizuryu Clan and first of all four of the Koga. Hirotsugu 
smirked to himself and turned around to face his young daughter. 

He rested a hand on his waist as he spoke. &quot;Well. You&#39;ve 
surpassed what I expected of you. In more ways than one. I truly 
expected the likes of Zanmaru-kun, Ryoko-kun and Setsuki-kun to 
fall to you, Mizuryu Yui. But to defeat both Hibuki-kun and 
Yagami-kun... that is something I would not have expected. 
Kudos. I must admit that I seriously underestimated the value of 
your talents those years ago. Your Mother would be proud.&quot;

Shiki&#39;s fist shook. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare talk about my Mother! And 
don&#39;t try making any excuses for yourself! For seven years I&#39;ve 
thought of nothing more than this day. The day that I would get 
my revenge on you. And I won&#39;t weaken for you or your 
ill-conceived words. You are going to die, Father. Right now.&quot;

&quot;...You really have grown up strong,&quot; Hirotsugu admitted; 
ignoring Shiki&#39;s comments and threats of death, &quot;It is quite 
possible that you would have fulfilled the mission I set out for 
you. But I could not have been sure of that. Hence the Scroll of 
Kokomaru...&quot;

At that point, Shiki didn&#39;t understand what Hirotsugu was 
talking about. But she did have one issue remaining on her mind. 
The one she had told Yagami of. And now she needed the answer to 
it. 

Shiki&#39;s hand reached behind her back and gripped Miyuki. &quot;I 
really couldn&#39;t give a damn about what you expect of me. But I 
have one question. That only you can answer. Why did you abandon 
me? Why did you leave me for dead? How could anyone with a sound 
human conscience... do that to someone else?&quot;

Hirotsugu crossed his arms and let his smile become a frown. 
&quot;You still didn&#39;t heed my words back then, did you? A conscience 
is a weight on the shinobi back. To become a true ninja one must 
strip themselves of caring and love and emotions. We must be as 
ice. Lacking the warmth that binds normal people to each other. 
That final step towards my own journey into becoming a true 
shinobi came on that day. To forsake my own daughter... to cart 
her off in a squalid slum in Morioka... that was the last test 
of my humanity. But... there were more reasons than just that&quot;

Shiki probed him. &quot;...And...?&quot;

&quot;Since the time of your birth, Yui-chan, you were modelled,&quot; 
Started the Honshu Koga, &quot;To be the ultimate kunoichi. 
Possessing a heart born of ice and a will made of steel. I 
sought to bring this out in you. And though I was largely 
successful in bringing out your great talents for the art of 
killing... there was one thing about you that I simply could not 
erase. And that was the accursed kindness you possess. The 
kindness that prevented you from taking human lives... even 
though you were fully capable of such. The conflict between your 
kind nature and the killing urge I nurtured inside you led to a 
dual-persona. The kind side of you was reflected in your normal 
life as Yui. Outside of that, the darker part of you was marked 
by the trade name you took on as a shinobi. That name was Shiki. 
The name I believe that you regard yourself with when you wear 
that facial mask nowadays. And because I couldn&#39;t draw out your 
full potential... you were worthless to me. That was why you 
were sent off to some random location in Morioka.&quot;

So that was the truth behind her name. But still, it gave rise 
to more questions. &quot;You used me! I wasn&#39;t some ninja of your 
clan that you could throw away when you felt like it! I was your 
daughter! What possible aims could you have for me that were so 
unreachable that you had to throw me out into the streets for?!&quot; 

Hirotsugu chuckled. &quot;You just don&#39;t get it, do you? Did you not 
think it was odd that you have faced only five of the Orochi to 
get here? I honed your great talents for one reason and one 
reason only. To take your place in my ninja team. In other 
words... you are the Sixth Orochi!&quot;

&quot;W-what!?&quot; Shiki yelled, stunned, &quot;Y-you&#39;re... lying! That can&#39;t 
be! What made you think that I would have worked for you after 
what you did to me!&quot;

Hirotsugu answered that. &quot;You were intended to be the last of 
the Orochi, my dear. The final ninja that would complete the 
team. If you had joined us... then nothing could have stopped 
the Six Orochi. But when I saw that kindness in you seven years 
ago... I knew that you were unfit to hold the position. By 
abandoning you in Morioka, I hoped to instil a deep hatred and 
sense of betrayal inside of you. One that would overwhelm the 
good-hearted nature. I knew that one day you would be coming 
back to Tokyo. To take revenge. To kill me. It&#39;s time to become 
ice... like myself, Yui-chan.&quot;

Shiki&#39;s fist shook as his held Miyuki. &quot;S-shut up!! I&#39;m not 
listening to any of this! None of it! You&#39;re not my Father! 
You&#39;re just some manipulative ex-shinobi with illusions of 
grandeur!&quot;

And to that, Hirotsugu smirked. &quot;Good girl. That&#39;s it. The 
vociferous anger I hoped to make you suffer with, my dear 
Yui-chan. You feel it, do you not? A rage so strong and cold 
that it constantly threatens to consume you? You should not 
resist its will. Let it take you over. Let your hatred become 
your strength.&quot;

Shiki closed her eyes and tried to block all this talk out. &quot;I 
said shut up!&quot; 

&quot;Ah. Still some conflict left in you,&quot; Hirotsugu claimed, &quot;It 
seems that the soul of Yui has yet to fall to the soul of Shiki. 
Maybe hearing what I&#39;ve planned for Japan might make more sense 
to you.&quot;

&quot;J-Japan...?&quot;

The Honshu Koga nodded to that and then turned his back to 
Shiki. He crouched down and picked up the Scroll of Kokomaru. It 
was growing bright blue. A faint glow but a noticeable one none 
the less. He turned back around and faced his daughter. &quot;Do you 
happen to know what this is?&quot;

Shiki gave no reply. 

And Hirotsugu took that as Yui&#39;s way of saying &#39;no&#39;. &quot;It is 
called the Scroll of Kokomaru. I assume that Genryukai-dono 
neglected to mention it. But then he probably has no idea that I 
still possess the scroll. You see... the fate of the Tengu 
Kokomaru has more of a chain effect on today&#39;s society than he 
believes. When the Kagayaku Clan gained their great powers and 
the other leading lords banded together to stop them, our family 
of Mizuryu sought solitude to come up with ways to counter the 
threat. This gave rise to the Scroll of Mizuryu. The scroll that 
possessed the technique we documented as a new weapon against 
the Kagayaku. The one you must have read to learn the Mizuryu 
Gijutsu, the power of self-hypnosis. And yet... although it 
contained great power, the Scroll of Mizuryu was absolutely 
nothing in comparison to the power of the Scroll of Kokomaru. 
The other lords of the Tengu Kokomaru joined forces and created 
this Scroll. Which contains the most secret and sacred of 
shinobi techniques. A power so great that the Kagayaku ran in 
fear from it. And the strength of this skill decimated the 
Family so badly that only a few of their kind remain in this day 
and age. But the survivors of the internal wars of the Tengu 
Kokomaru were fearful of the power of this skill they had 
created. So they used all their remaining power to cast a spell 
upon it. It was a sealing rite. They bound the scroll with 
something called Fuin no Seishinryoku (Seal of Willpower). It 
was decided that the scroll should be entrusted to those who 
helped defeat the Kagayaku. The Mizuryu Clan. Our ancestors. 
Then the four remaining shinobi clans of the Tengu Kokomaru;  
Ishida, Matsumoto, Watabe and us the Mizuryu, all went our 
separate ways. Ending the will of the greatest ninja union of 
all time. But contact between the four clans did not end. The 
four leaders of each clan maintained union. And they always 
have. Even into the present day.&quot;

Shiki blinked with surprise. &quot;...You mean...&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; He confirmed, &quot;The Four Koga are the direct descendants 
of the leaders of the Tengu Kokomaru. The Scroll of Kokomaru was 
entrusted to me by birthright. And though dear old 
Genryukai-dono stole the Mizuryu Scroll from the Shinrin Jinja, 
he was unsuccessful in stealing the Scroll of Kokomaru.&quot;

&quot;So what do you plan do with it!? As if I have to ask!&quot;

Again, Hirotsugu chuckled. &quot;I am going to open Fuin no 
Seishinryoku. I will unbind that ancient seal because I have 
discovered the way to do this. Our forefathers decreed that the 
seal will be broken and the scroll will be opened once the 
&#39;spirit of nation&#39; is restored. They believed that use of the 
scroll would be safe if the country stood united rather than 
divided against each other like it was in our feudal past. But 
no one person in this country will ever stand on their own two 
feet as long as the western superpowers hold us by the throat.  
We need to return to the individuality and isolation of our own 
hearts and minds. Once that spirit of self reliance reaches a 
peak... it will give rise to the shattering of the Willpower 
Seal.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Now everything made sense, &quot;That was why you wanted 
Fujiwara-sama to announce the re-assertion of the Closed Country 
policy. So that we would learn to think as a self-reliant unit. 
That surge of &#39;willpower&#39; will break the seal. And allow you to 
unlock the power of the Scroll of Kokomaru...&quot;

Hirotsugu nodded. &quot;Correct. When the seal breaks I will have the 
powers of the ancient ones. The great skill that was able to 
destroy the Kagayaku Family. I will use all that ancient power 
to smash the other three Koga and take over Japan. To rule in my 
own name. The feeble people of this nation, growing lethargic 
and obese on the powers and influences of the west, will no 
longer serve a weak, helpless government and a pathetic Prime 
Minister. They shall bow to a new Emperor. Now, the seemingly 
deceased wish of the Tengu Kokomaru, the will to usurp the 
ruling powers... it will all be realized by my hand. I will 
become Kami-sama no Nihon (God of Japan). No military power will 
ever be able to stand against me, national or foreign. The three 
other Koga and their respective ninja clans will all die. It 
will be the glorious, beautiful birth of a new Japan.&quot;

Shiki gave him a scowl of pity. &quot;...And exactly how did I fit in 
all of this?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; Hirotsugu sniggered lowly, &quot;You have no idea 
how powerful you are. Or how important you are to my plans. I 
threw you away to strengthen myself and replace your kindness 
with hate. I let you stay at Morioka with your adoptive parents 
long enough to grow into a powerful kunoichi. And I sent each of 
the five remaining Orochi against you. But not specifically to 
kill you. Rather... to test you. To see if you had grown into 
the strength that I had beaten into you during your childhood. 
And you&#39;ve exceeded even my wildest dreams. You may still 
possess that disgusting kindness in your heart... but your 
strength makes you more than worthy.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; Shiki asked.   

&quot;...To be my successor,&quot; Hirotsugu answered, his face darkening, 
&quot;We of the Mizuryu Family are destined to rule. We were the 
primary Family of Tengu Kokomaru. We spearheaded the fight 
against the Kagayaku. We were entrusted with the Scroll of 
Kokomaru. We are the backbone of this nation. It is our 
birthright to rule Japan. Once I takeover... and when I die 
after doing so... I will need someone to follow in my footsteps. 
That will be you. You shall carry the blood of the Mizuryu Clan 
to new generations. You shall protect our rule until it is time 
for your offspring to take control. And so the cycle will 
continue. The Mizuryu will finally have what we deserve. 
Ultimate, un-shared and un-contested power over Japan.&quot;

The Burning Kunoichi&#39;s fist kept shaking at the hilt of Miyuki. 
The part of her that was Shiki was being seduced into this idea. 
And the other part of her that Yui was... frightened. So many 
emotions were swirling around in her head. Anger, hatred, fear, 
desperation, anxiety. But even deeper ones arose from the offers 
of Hirotsugu. Like greed and power hunger. The dark and yet 
somehow inviting idea of absolute power. Shiki released the 
handle of her sword and held a hand to her chest. Another 
internal battle between the personae of the dark Shiki and the 
kind (Hazumaru) Yui was taking place. And Hirotsugu could see 
it. 

His smile brightened. &quot;You can feel it, can you not? The will of 
the Mizuryu and the old Tengu Kokomaru. The will to rule. You 
cannot escape it. Even if you kill me now that will make you 
next in line to be the Honshu Koga. So join me. Follow me as the 
heir to my future empire and we will control this country as 
Father and Daughter!&quot;

The side of the girl that was Hazumaru Yui managed to hold out. 
&quot;...N-Not a chance!&quot;

&quot;A pity.  You do not seem to understand this situation. You are 
destined to be my heir. And if you will not become so with 
reason... then you shall become so with force.&quot; Hirotsugu shook 
his head, and pulled aside the large sleeve of his informal 
kimono. He was retired now; so he was not an active shinobi. But 
he was intending to do something. Shiki saw this but did not 
care. She gripped the hilt of Miyuki again and ripped it from 
its bamboo sheath. She gave a heart-rending scream of anger an 
then thrust herself straight for her Father across the Room of 
Fates. Hirotsugu pulled up his hand and his eyes hardened. As 
soon as Shiki reached him he forced out his hand and a bright 
white flash illuminated the dark hall. Hirotsugu&#39;s expression 
was filled with equal anger and zeal as he screamed out the name 
of the attack. 

&quot;Kokoroha!&quot;
(Mind Wave!)

And &#39;Kokoroha&#39; was the last phrase that Shiki heard as she felt 
herself thudded into a deep unconsciousness state, collapsing to 
the ground. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;...W-Where... am I...?&quot;

Yui sighed as her eyes fluttered open. That Kokoroha thing was 
some form of Ninjutsu. But she couldn&#39;t quite place it. But that 
became the least of her worries. Yui nudged herself up and held 
a hand to her forehead. Her free uncovered eye looked down at 
her body. And she noticed that she was not in her ninja gear. 
All her weapons (her bamboo sword Miyuki and the remaining 
shuriken created for her by Genryukai) were still with her; but 
she was dressed in her Kimagure Gakuen schoolgirl outfit. What 
was this about? What did Hirotsugu do to her? Yui stood up 
urgently and looked around. And she was even more shocked to see 
that she was not in the Room of Fates anymore. She was on a huge 
circular pillar. From one side to the other it was about fifty 
metres long. The pillar was erected in a void of space. Towards 
the bottom of that void were the colours of a beautiful sunset, 
all of them mixed together to create a wondrous background. The 
skies above were of a different tone. They were bleak and grey, 
full of thick dark clouds that broke with loud thunder and 
lightning every few seconds. Two settings that were meshed into 
one. What on earth could that mean? Where was she?

Yui searched around for something. Or someone. Aside from the 
pillar there was nothing at all at this beautiful-ugly place. 
How would she get home? How did Hirotsugu send her here? The 
heart of the young Yui began beating faster and faster from the 
worry of all this, but then that changed when she saw a new 
figure step onto the pillar with her. The body blurred into view 
via Ninjutsu teleportation. With a young woman&#39;s figure and 
dressed fully in light brown ninja clothing. With a bamboo sword 
similar to Miyuki on the back of her waist and twin shuriken 
pouches on both her legs. And... most distinguishing of all, was 
the chocolate brown hair, emerald eyes and facial wrappings...

There was a quiver in Yui&#39;s throat. &quot;...Is that... me...?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; The image chuckled to herself, &quot;We are not the 
same. I am Shiki. The darker side of you that was created from 
the training and brainwashing that our Father subjected you to, 
seven years ago. It was why the Room of Meeting felt so familiar 
to you. It was where you were trained. But because you could not 
abandon your kindness... there was a conflict inside your 
mind... one that gave birth to me. A second personality born of 
hatred and anger and killing. Unlike you, I am a true shinobi. 
Worthy to be the future ruler of Japan.&quot;

Yui shook her head. &quot;No! Hirotsugu-san is mad! He won&#39;t succeed! 
And I don&#39;t want to follow him into his grave! I&#39;m going to stop 
him before he can break the seal!&quot;

&quot;...Really...?&quot; Shiki chuckled again, then jumped into the air 
slightly. She swiftly blurred into nothingness and shifted 
behind Yui. The schoolgirl froze up as Shiki reappeared behind 
her, more than ready to kill. But no weapon had been drawn, 
&quot;...And what makes you think that you have it in you to be a 
killer? You&#39;re weak, Yui-chan. A snot-nosed little girl trying 
to be a kunoichi. There is nothing about you that is capable of 
killing someone. You&#39;re too feeble. You need my power to stop 
Hirotsugu-yarou. And as I see it... his influence would give me 
the kind of power I&#39;ve been nurtured to love. Even if I kill 
him... I could become Honshu Koga. I would control over one 
quarter of the political power in this country. With the Scroll 
of Kokomaru open, I could eventually kill the other Koga and 
take over rest of Japan. I could be Kami-sama no Nihon. But with 
you and your benevolence in the way... I will never have the 
glory that I so rightly deserve. As foretold by the birthright 
of all Mizuryu. Do you realize that? Your kindness is my 
weakness.&quot;

Yui again heard that subtle chime sound. The sound of blur 
movement. She blinked one second and looked forwards. Shiki was 
standing across from her again. But unlike before, she now had a 
weapon drawn. A shuriken from her left thigh pouch. The Dark 
Kunoichi smirked for a moment and then idly threw the shuriken 
at Yui. The schoolgirl gasped as it zipped past her right arm. 
Grazing it. She cried out as a second shuriken came and slashed 
her other arm, drawing a deeper gash and therefore a deeper flow 
of blood. The Kimagure Gakuen school uniform offered little 
protection from Genryukai&#39;s sharp shuriken stars. Yui gripped 
both sides of her shoulders with both hands. To contain the pain 
and to stop the flow of blood. 

Shiki continued to smirk. &quot;You fool. This is a battleground of 
the mind. If you fall here then your body becomes mine. Aren&#39;t 
you going to fight? Come on, fight! Submit to your anger and 
embrace your true nature. Embrace me...&quot;

Yui looked up at her. &quot;...I won&#39;t lie. I need your power. I&#39;ve 
always needed your power... your courage. As Hazumaru Yui... I 
am just another helpless human being. As Shiki... I am 
powerful... strong... brave... almost fearless. However I don&#39;t 
need your blood-thirst or your ambition! You might be the source 
of all my strength... but you represent every devious, evil act 
that Hirotsugu-san has committed against me and others, 
Shiki-san!&quot;

&quot;Stop resisting it,&quot; Shiki barked, &quot;I&#39;m the Sixth Orochi. I&#39;m 
the daughter of Hirotsugu-yarou. I&#39;m the one who defeated 
Yagami-san. And I&#39;ve done nothing but exist up until now. You 
could not hope to stand against Hirotsugu-yarou and the Mizuryu 
Clan without me. If you reject my influence here... you&#39;ll die 
by their hands. And what of Haruko-chan? Your feeble nature 
would never keep her safe. Do you realize that? By rejecting 
me... you&#39;re endangering the one who we care most for.&quot;

But, just then, a smile pulled across Yui&#39;s lips. She lifted her 
head upwards and looked over at the representative shinobi of 
the darker half of her mind. &quot;Wrong. You are my true enemy. You 
are... the Hirotsugu of my mind. And although I&#39;ve used you as a 
weapon against the likes of the Orochi and the Mizuryu... from 
now on, I will rely on... my own strength. And that strength 
will protect Haruko-chan...&quot;

Shiki began to scowl. &quot;Silence!&quot;

She hurled another of those razor sharp shuriken at her good 
half in that second. But Yui saw this and went for her own 
shuriken pouch. She quickly withdrew one and tossed it at the 
exact same speed. The two metal death stars clashed against each 
other noisily over the wide stone pillar. And Shiki&#39;s eyes 
widened as her attack was deflected. 

Yui still smiled, one eye shut. &quot;Well... how about that? I 
guess... you aren&#39;t the complete source of my power after all... 
huh?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a fool,&quot; Shiki barked, lowering her arms, &quot;If you think 
you can go this alone then so be it. But one day you&#39;ll be 
fighting an enemy that is far too strong for you. Then you will 
need my strength to add to your own. Be sure of it. One day... 
you&#39;ll come crawling back...&quot;

That image of her dark side soon began to shatter. Like glass. 
Shiki froze and then each piece of her began to float away into 
the winds of Hazumaru Yui&#39;s mind. Soon enough she was gone from 
the pillar. The stage of mental combat. &#39;Shiki&#39;, the darker, 
evil side of Yui that was sculpted within her from childhood; 
would always be there. But for now... that darker nature would 
remain buried. Allowing Yui to continue her work. 

It was time to finish the job.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Room of Fates, Shinrin Jinja

&quot;...It cannot be...&quot;

Hirotsugu was astounded. It was simply amazing. Even though she 
had been blasted with the Kokoroha, Shiki was waking up just a 
short few minutes later. The young woman groaned roughly into 
her long facial wrappings and slowly but surely pulled herself 
upwards from the awkwardly clumped position she fell into. Her 
bright emerald eyes fluttered open and looked up at the startled 
older man. The Honshu Koga. Her Father. Shiki slowly stood on 
two wobbly but determined legs and faced off with him. After 
waiting so long, after fighting so many fights, it all came down 
to this. Shiki locked eyes with her father and frowned from 
behind her facial wrappings. No matter what... it was time to 
end him.

Hirotsugu gave a surprised smile. &quot;Such strength... I assumed 
that the Mind Wave would have you down for some time. Time 
enough for you to see sense and join me. But you are not like 
other kunoichi. Or other shinobi for that matter. You are 
special. You truly are my daughter, Mizuryu Yui.&quot;

Shiki gripped the hilt of Miyuki. &quot;I abandoned the name of 
Mizuryu long ago. Just as you abandoned me. Now I have been 
hired to kill you. Your life ends today.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Hirotsugu grinned, closing those dark eyes of his and 
whispered to himself, &quot;I can guess who paid you to kill me. The 
Hokkaido Koga. Smart move, woman. No wonder I loved you so. Even 
though you are a member of the Ishida now...&quot;

Whatever Hirotsugu said to himself, Shiki ignored it. She went 
for the handle of her bamboo sword on her back waist and 
withdrew it in a flash. The young woman then charged straight 
ahead at the still, calm, close-eyed Hirotsugu. He knew what was 
coming. He didn&#39;t fight against it. His plans had failed. And he 
was about to die.

{I wonder...} Hirotsugu thought as Shiki neared him, {...Does 
Yui-chan know who the Hokkaido Koga really is? I suppose not. 
Well then, Fumiko. It seems as though you have your wish. My own 
daughter will kill me... and you will have your revenge. But 
once her darker, true nature comes to light... my wish to rule 
Japan will live on in her actions. Then we shall see... who the 
true victor is in all this...} 

Three seconds later...

...Hirotsugu&#39;s head was chopped straight off his shoulders. 

The decapitated corpse of the Honshu Koga collapsed to the 
ground, spurting vicious pints of blood from the sliced neck. 
That crimson red blood splattered all over the floorboards of 
the Room of Fates. While his head whizzed through the air in 
motion. Until it tipped back down to the ground and rolled into 
a stop. The lips of the head were still sporting a smile. 
Shiki&#39;s sliding slash came to a stop as she brought herself to 
one. She stood still for a moment. Then she dropped the now 
bloody Miyuki to the ground and absorbed the sudden silence in 
that room. 

A tear slipped down Shiki&#39;s cheek, over her wrappings. 
&quot;...Mission complete...&quot;

The Honshu Koga... was dead.

...But what would be the repercussions? 

Only time, it seems, will tell.

Now you hear me
For the things I see
Yeah, I believe in inner peace, yeah

Throw Out
Blow Up
Hold In

Show Fine
No Signs
Grow Blind

Kaiser&#39;s Afterthoughts
---------------------------

* My first ninja story. Some of the plot is quite basic at the 
heart of it, but this story was less about romance and revenge 
as it was about action and politics. I&#39;d like to think that I 
pulled off that amalgamation well, but if I didn&#39;t, there&#39;s 
always sequels to work with. I already have plans for Burning 
Spirit Kunoichi 2, I&#39;m just debating whether or not to follow 
through and actually start writing it. Especially since I&#39;ve 
started to get back into the fanfiction world. 

* One odd thing I did with this fiction was add suffixes (i.e. 
-san, -chan, -yarou, -sama). I don&#39;t usually do that with my 
Japanese-based stories because they can complicate matters, but 
I&#39;ve been giving them a whirl recently. I feel (to a certain 
extent) comfortable with them, but I won&#39;t be using them for 
stories other than those linked to Burning Spirit Kunoichi. 

* This was actually written shortly before Christmas of 2004, 
but I didn&#39;t think to post it anywhere. Sorry about that. 

* The songs &#39;Something to Believe In&#39;, &#39;Confusion&#39; and &#39;Shame in 
You&#39;  do not belong to me. They are property of the Offspring 
(Epitaph) and the former Alice in Chains (Columbia). I claim no 
ownership of them, whatsoever (as if I could write songs THAT 
good).
