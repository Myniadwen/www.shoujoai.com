<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 15 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>      Erin was eating breakfast as Faye was... actually she wasn&#39;t sure what Faye was doing 
in her room. She tenderly put the spoon in her mouth, careful of how she chewed her cereal. 
Fangs weren&#39;t the easiest to deal with. It was then that she heard Faye... talking to 
herself?

      She walked over to the bedroom to see Faye holding something. &quot;What happened to you? 
How&#39;d you get so small...?&quot; Erin pushed the door open slightly, but she couldn&#39;t see who 
Faye was talking to. &quot;Oh, you silly thing... you&#39;re still wearing that bell? You&#39;re so 
sweet, Posh-Posh.&quot;

      Erin froze. Posh-Posh...? She opened the door to see the tiny snake as lovingly 
wrapped around Faye&#39;s hand and arm. The red head looked up and over at her. &quot;Oh! Erin... 
haha, I found this adorable little snake and-&quot;

      &quot;Who are you?&quot; Erin asked, looking quite serious.

      Faye froze up. &quot;I... I&#39;m Faye. Are you alright-&quot;

      &quot;No, I&#39;m not! What aren&#39;t you telling me? How did you know his name is Posh-Posh? How 
do you know so many things about me?&quot;

      Faye let out a long sigh before letting Posh-Posh slither onto the floor. Erin moved 
to the side to allow the snake to leave the room. &quot;Oh, Erin... I was hoping you&#39;d remember 
this all by yourself... then again, I should have been happy enough to find you...&quot;

      Erin was getting unnerved. It seemed for the last couple of days, Faye had... well, it 
was like she was trying to hide something and doing a terrible job of it as time went on. 
&quot;You don&#39;t remember at all? Even though you must have realized you&#39;re a goddess, you can&#39;t 
remember yet?&quot;

      Faye startled Erin with that knowledge. &quot;How... how do you know all that?&quot;

      She just motioned for Erin to come over to her. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting so long, so it&#39;s 
been really hard... I... didn&#39;t want to scare you, but...&quot; Erin came over to her cautiously. 
&quot;...will you let me jog your memory?&quot;

      Erin tilted her head in confusion as Faye&#39;s hands grabbed her shoulders. She let out a 
muffled sound as Faye&#39;s lips engulfed her own in a steamy kiss. Erin was so confused; she 
thought Faye was strange, but... but... all thought started to melt from her mind as Faye 
continued to kiss her. Erin had made out with a boy or two, but... it had never been like 
this.

      So soft and passionate and... and... Faye moved one hand to splay across her back and 
another tangled itself up in Erin&#39;s hair. The snake goddess let out a moan as Faye nibbled 
on her bottom lip, and then took advantage of her open mouth with her tongue.

      Suddenly, Erin was aware of what they were doing. She was kissing a girl (a girl?!) 
who also happened to be slightly off kilter and knew she was goddess. Erin came for answers, 
not a hot... wonderful... make out session... She pulled herself together before tearing 
herself away from Faye&#39;s hold. She landed haphazardly on the bed, breathing heavily. Just as 
she was about to question Faye, the other woman straddled her waist, her hands placed on 
each side of Erin&#39;s head.

      &quot;You... do not know how long I have waited for this...&quot; Faye said, her voice husky and 
strained. Erin had to wonder if this was why the red head seemed so anxious earlier. &quot;What 
are you doing?!&quot; She said in a hushed whisper, only to find herself caught in one of those 
mind blowing kisses. Faye pulled away and started placing open mouthed kisses on the mark on 
Erin&#39;s neck.

      &quot;Mmm... I&#39;m going to help you remember me...&quot; Faye said, working on making a hickey on 
her shoulder. &quot;Wh-why are you doing this...?&quot; Erin moaned out, trying to gain her composure.

      &quot;Because I love you... everything about you - I never got a chance to tell you how 
much I love your voice...&quot; Faye said, pulling away to look down at her. &quot;I love how you 
appeared so cool and collected, but you&#39;re so shy... I love how I can embarrass you... I 
love how you make me think about who I am and how you humble me...&quot;

      Erin just stared at her blankly. &quot;That&#39;s really nice, but... I don&#39;t understand what 
you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;ve only known you for a few days!&quot; Faye looked peeved, but leaned in 
to kiss her again. Erin sighed happily into her mouth. Every time Faye kissed her, all 
thoughts went out of her head and... and...

      Why were Faye&#39;s hands under her shirt? When the red head pulled away, she started to 
pull up Erin&#39;s shirt, leaving kisses on her taut stomach. It was then that Erin realized 
what was going on. &quot;Um, Faye! I don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready for this kind of thing...!&quot;

      She was still trying to take off her shirt. &quot;Oh, hush! I&#39;ve come this far and I am NOT 
going to let a case of amnesia get in the way of us!&quot; Erin let out a whine as Faye&#39;s mouth 
made its way to her collarbone and started to suckle at her skin.

      Erin struggled before finally pushing Faye away. She scooted away, sitting on the bed, 
quite out of breath. &quot;Faye...! What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot;

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong with me? Are you kidding?&quot; Faye asked, eyeing her like a hungry 
predator. &quot;Do you know how long I&#39;ve waited for you? I&#39;ve been faithful this whole time, 
which is amazing for me, so I&#39;m sorry, Erin.&quot; She crawled over to where Erin was and she, in 
turn, scooted away. &quot;I just REALLY need you right now... I will explain it later, but right 
now, I need to feel your body...!&quot;

      With that, she pounced and Erin barely jumped off the bed in time. In any other 
situation, she probably would have thought the image to be funny. Erin scrambled out the 
bedroom and stopped before turning around and taking a few steps back. Faye came busting out 
of the room and Erin had to resist the urge to run away again.

      &quot;Faye, I think we just really need to talk,&quot; said Erin, breathlessly. &quot;Oh no we don&#39;t. 
You may not remember now, but when I&#39;m done with you, I&#39;m sure it will all come back,&quot; Faye 
murmured, licking her lips desperately.

      Erin almost looked around to see if there were cameras because she felt like she was 
on the set of a porno or something. She was pretty scared the Faye was going to grab her, 
drag her back to her love nest of a bed and have her naughty little way with her. Erin 
gulped audibly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I just... don&#39;t really want to do that...!&quot;

      Faye gritted her teeth. &quot;Damn amnesia... if you hadn&#39;t forgotten everything I would 
have you in my lap, mewling like the cute little kitten you are...&quot; Erin took a step back 
after that statement. &quot;You&#39;re so frustrating, Erin! Try and remember!&quot;

      She was frustrating?! Erin wasn&#39;t the one forcing sex upon- Frustrating. Someone said 
that to her before. &quot;You... you&#39;re that girl.&quot; Hope dawned upon Faye&#39;s face as Erin tried to 
make sense of the memories not her own.

      &quot;You&#39;re the young woman that always came and talked to me by the river... or well, not 
me, but you know what I mean!&quot; Faye nodded and smiled happily. &quot;Great! You do remember me, 
oh Erin it makes me so happy-&quot;

      &quot;Ah, but you were really rude. And kind of a brat...&quot;

      &quot;I am no brat! I... I mean that I&#39;m not a brat anymore, missy, jeez...&quot; Faye looked 
slightly perturbed but she walked over to Erin happily. &quot;So you remember everything, then?&quot;

      Erin gave her a sheepish smile. &quot;Uh, no... but... but if I met you a long time ago why 
are you still alive?&quot; Faye didn&#39;t answer that question and only said, &quot;You only remember 
that? When I was a total brat? And nothing else...?&quot;

      When the dark haired girl shook her head, Faye lunged at her. &quot;Then, I will just help 
you remember...!&quot;

      &quot;No! That&#39;s cool! Let&#39;s not get physical!&quot; Erin shouted, dodging the red head and 
making her way to the door. &quot;Erin! I&#39;m not going to hurt you,&quot; Faye said as Erin opened the 
front door. Oh, she was sure Faye wouldn&#39;t hurt her... she just didn&#39;t want to indulge in 
such an activity while totally confused as to what the hell was going on!

      The snake goddess decided that Faye was definitely off her rocker and this would be a 
perfect time to get in contact with her friends. She shot through the front door and started 
running down the sidewalk, totally disregarding the stares she was getting.

      Then again, Erin was quite sure that a teenager with strange colored hair and eyes 
running barefoot down the sidewalk would look strange. Very strange. That pretty much summed 
up her life at the moment, it seemed...

      She searched around frantically, before her eyes landed on a nearby coffee shop. She 
entered and said, &quot;I really need to use the phone; it&#39;s an emergency!&quot; Luckily, no one else 
was in the shop except for the teenage boy at the cash register and his manager behind the 
counter. They gave her a strange look before the manager told the boy to give her the phone.

      &quot;Thank you so much,&quot; Erin said hurriedly, grabbing the receiver. She stepped behind 
the counter and started to dial. When she got the operator, she told the woman on the other 
line that she was looking for the number of Abby Kasaguri.

      Erin looked out the windows of the shop to make sure Faye wasn&#39;t going to bust in and 
drag her back so she could... what did the red head say? Have her mewling in her lap like a 
kitten. Erin gulped as the operator patched her through. 

***** 

      &quot;Um, Krystal?&quot; The blonde woman looked up from her laptop to see Mina in front of her. 
&quot;Hmm?&quot; The ebony haired girl sat down on the couch next to her. &quot;I was wondering if I could 
ask you something...&quot;

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Krystal said, putting away her laptop. Mina just smiled. &quot;I just... I 
wanted to ask you about... well, you and Isaka haven&#39;t done it yet, right?&quot; It took a moment 
for the older girl to understand what she meant. &quot;No... no we haven&#39;t.&quot;

      Mina nervously bit her lip. &quot;...do you have any advice...? I mean you two are more 
experienced than we are...&quot; Krystal was starting to feel this conversation go done the road 
of awkwardness. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be asking Isaka? I mean, you and her... share similar roles 
in our respective relationships.&quot;

      The younger girl just shook her head. &quot;No... Eveon is actually a lot like Isaka. They 
both seem really confident and tough on the inside, but their so sweet and vulnerable on the 
inside!&quot; Krystal never thought about it that way, but...

      &quot;If you really want Eveon to melt in your arms, you just have to hold her really 
gently. Stroke her back and other loving gestures. If she is anything like Isaka,&quot; Krystal 
almost laughed at the thought, &quot;then she will love for you to take care of her. I don&#39;t 
know, but maternal girls really turn on Isaka.&quot; Now that Krystal thought about it, it was 
vaguely creepy. No wonder the brown haired woman thought Abby was a MILF.

      &quot;Ah, okay. I just wanted to make sure and stuff, you know... When you do have... or, 
well, when you make love to Isaka, can... you tell me about it?&quot; Krystal just flushed bright 
red. &quot;A-ah, I can ask Isaka instead if you&#39;re too embarrassed-&quot;

      Krystal shook her head. &quot;No, no, you&#39;ll probably be better off just asking me 
instead...&quot; Isaka would probably be a bit... explicit.

      Speaking of her beloved demon, Isaka was in another room having a similar discussion 
with Eveon. &quot;If I wanted to be a little more aggressive, what should I do...? I mean, I 
don&#39;t want to mess up or look like an idiot or something...&quot; Eveon murmured, &quot;I figured 
you&#39;d be the best one to ask...&quot;

      Isaka just scoffed. &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right? Eveon, you need to understand something - 
if your significant other has the control, it&#39;s hard for you to change anything.&quot; The blonde 
girl looked highly confused. &quot;What I mean is that you and I have special way we can affect 
Krystal and Mina. They have a great desire to nurture us and hug us and kiss us and do other 
things that you aren&#39;t old enough to do yet.&quot;

      Eveon pouted, but Isaka continued on. &quot;We have those desires as well, but... 
unfortunately, those two are in total control of us. Even if I play the top, I&#39;m so 
submissive to Krystal&#39;s will that she can do whatever she wants to me.&quot; Isaka let out a sigh 
at the thought. She didn&#39;t really mind the idea of Krystal taking advantage of her, but...

      &quot;Great. Thanks Isaka for telling me I can&#39;t do anything for Mina...&quot; Eveon said, 
sitting next to the demon. &quot;Just... tease her. Mina teases you all the time. You have a 
sarcastic streak, so maybe you have a mischievous one as well.&quot;

      The two exchanged glances before letting out a simultaneous sigh. They got up and 
decided to head to the living room, where Mina and Krystal just happened to be. Just as the 
two couples were about to start talking, the phone started ringing.

      &quot;Excuse me...&quot; Abby said, walking towards it. &quot;Sorry girls, didn&#39;t mean for the phone 
to interrupt you. If you&#39;re going to start an orgy, I recommend den, not the living room.&quot; 
When she picked up the phone, she was surprised to hear the frantic voice of Erin.

      &quot;Oh, Erin... you sound... a little crazy. You can thank our dynamic lesbian duo if 
you&#39;re still suffering from traumatic pain or- eh? You&#39;re not in a good situation...?&quot; At 
this moment, Krystal scrambled to the telephone and hit speakerphone. 

***** 

      &quot;Abby, I would love to listen to your scathing jokes, but this is an emergency!&quot; Erin 
said, practically shouting. That was when Krystal put it on speakerphone and started to 
talk. &quot;Erin? Are you safe? Where are you?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m safe - kind of. I had a lapse in my memory for a while and now I&#39;m getting chased 
by some crazy lady and I&#39;m... oh I don&#39;t know where I am...!&quot; It then that the boy at the 
register hesitantly handed her the business card of the coffee shop. She mouthed a quick 
&#39;thank you&#39; before looking at it.

      &quot;Krystal? Do you have a pen or something?&quot; The blonde said yes and Erin recited the 
address. When she finished, Eveon spoke to Krystal. &quot;That was the town where the museum was 
at...&quot;

      It was then that Krystal realized something. &quot;That flower shop is in this same town 
and that ribbon...&quot; She looked at Isaka and the demon massaged her temples. &quot;Oh, Krystal, 
you were right about that damn ribbon being suspicious...&quot;

      Erin wasn&#39;t sure what they were saying, but it was then that she saw Faye through the 
glass windows. She ducked down beneath the counter and motioned to the teenage boy not to 
give away that she was there. Faye walked in, baseball cap on her head, dressed casually.

      &quot;Have you seen a girl with greenish black hair? I think she ran this way and I really 
need to find her.&quot; The teenage boy just shook his head. &quot;Nope, &#39;fraid not.&quot; Faye pursed her 
lips together. The boy was lying, for sure. She leaned over the counter and presumptuously 
grabbed his chin. &quot;Tell me... where is she...?&quot;

      The boy stared at her for a minute before blushing and smiling like an idiot. Faye 
smiled a bit. Her ability to charm others came in handy... He pointed straight down and Faye 
grinned.

      &quot;Erin, don&#39;t worry, we&#39;re coming right now,&quot; Krystal told her, but Erin gulped, 
looking up. Faye was leaning all the way over the counter, grinning down at her. Erin 
giggled nervously as Faye grabbed the phone and put it back in the cradle. &quot;...Erin...&quot;

      &quot;...yes...?&quot;

      &quot;...do you want to come back to the apartment with me?&quot;

      &quot;N-not particularly... you&#39;ve been very kind, but um... haha...&quot;

      And thus began another chase as Erin bolted out the door after Faye lunged over the 
counter. The manager and the teenage boy just stared. &quot;Why are you blushing like an idiot? 
The counter&#39;s a mess thanks to them!&quot; The love-struck boy started to tidy up thanks to his 
manager&#39;s not so nice words. 

***** 

      &quot;Why did Erin hang up?&quot; Mina asked and all the women exchanged looks. &quot;We weren&#39;t done 
talking...&quot; Abby let out a sigh. &quot;Well, she did say she was getting chased by someone-&quot;

      Krystal started walking out of the room. &quot;I&#39;m getting my sword... get ready to go 
Isaka.&quot; The demon just nodded and followed her out. Eveon watched them, wide eyed. &quot;Isn&#39;t a 
sword a bit much...?&quot; Abby shrugged. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just Krystal&#39;s form of compensation.&quot;

      &quot;I heard that, Abby!&quot;
