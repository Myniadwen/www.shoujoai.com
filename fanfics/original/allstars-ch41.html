12:50 pm

 

Sometimes, the world revolves in very strange ways. Take one Shannon 
Wilson, Scandinavian in appearance and American by birth, now tending to 
St. Thekla&#39;s dwindling sports program as if she were the answer to so 
many prayers. Shannon, of all people, who had been another nameless face 
in the crowd until that year! Shannon, who most people only knew by weak 
association; Shannon the spoiled girl, Shannon the doll, Shannon the 
desperate rebel, Shannon the vibrant, the mouthy, the starving, the 
lonely. Damn, but she was human.

Still more dramatic was the change she had undergone in a year&#39;s time. 
Most people her age see enough turbulence as they grow, but Shannon&#39;s 
whole world was taken away, turned on its ear, and thrust back like a 
crumpled ball of paper. She had been forcibly expelled from her old 
school, along with all the other students and faculty, torn apart from 
friends and pushed into a world that neither understood nor accepted 
her. Thankfully, Shannon came from wealth, and her father still had 
enough influence to brush her underneath the protective carpet of a 
small private girls&#39; school until she graduated. St. Thekla&#39;s had not 
been her first choice for college life- she had wanted to travel to the 
western coast, perhaps in Washington or Canada- but a coincidental 
meeting with the university&#39;s miniscule athletics department altered her 
fate.

Like Carnegie, St. Thekla&#39;s was encouraging several sports teams of 
their own- not to win any prizes or prestige, but merely to provide 
their students with a pastime they could be proud of. In other words, 
&quot;something that would look good on a r&eacute;sum&eacute;&quot;. Shannon had little 
interest in sports outside of ice skating, but her uncanny ability to 
predict where a ball might fly in trajectory earned her passage into the 
school&#39;s soccer program, as its star goalie. From then on, her life had 
become a whirlwind, and she (and the school) were gaining a strong 
reputation. Shannon had little interest in the sport- she wanted to be a 
dancer one day- but she had her pride, and would not allow herself to 
back down because of a little indifference. Besides, she was gaining a 
few friends, and seemed to have something of a life again.

But there was a hole in her heart that only one person could fill- and 
they were halfway across the world, probably forgotten all about her and 
the time they shared. Oh well; that was the way things went. There were 
no happy endings; Shannon merely had fleeting moments to look forward 
to. And now it was time to make one.

&quot;Coming, Wilson?&quot; her coach said. Shannon stood up from her meditation.

&quot;You bet!&quot;

 

In this wide world

People you&#39;re meant to meet can be seen

Beyond the window, beyond the rainbow

I think you&#39;re aware of them

Take off that restrictive weight

Let your feelings go

Now keep your ears open and wait for that time

Awaken now

Cherish the little dream you&#39;ve drawn in the vast sky

If you do, you can always become happy

It&#39;s certain, whoa whoa!

 

&quot;Against a Wall&quot;

 

&quot;Well, folks, it hasn&#39;t even been five minutes yet and it&#39;s already 
shaping up to be a great game. Carnegie&#39;s Nguyen has taken the offensive 
early on, with Nazario and Howlet close at hand, and they&#39;ve bulldozed 
right through St. Thekla&#39;s defense. Nguyen&#39;s already made a shot, but 
up-and-coming superstar Shannon Wilson came forward to show everyone 
here what she was made of. People have been calling her &#39;the unbreakable 
wall&#39;, and even though Carnegie had an excellent attack, they stood no 
chance against their aptly-named opponent.

&quot;Now it looks as though they&#39;re playing things conservatively. St. 
Thekla&#39;s forward Omnerson has the ball now- whoa, she got sideswiped by 
Beckett and Velur. Beckett looks a little shaky out there today, but 
Velur&#39;s her same old stunning self. It looks like...yes, they&#39;re going 
for another offense. Velur&#39;s got it, Ramirez and Cocza block her, she 
swerves to a hard right, passes to Beckett, she holds...oh, and Ramirez 
intercepts! Was Kasumi Beckett asleep down there? Now Ramirez is taking 
it in deep. Howlet and Tu have drawn a bead on her and are closing in. 
Khovansky&#39;s going for the kill...she gets the ball back, sends it to 
Howlet...Howlet&#39;s playing things evasively, showing off those famous 
unpredictable moves of hers... Remember that Rain Howlet was the 
last-minute addition to the team during their decisive victory against 
Lovelace, and she&#39;s been...whoa, is she going for another offensive? It 
looks like...she is! Cocza and Figeroa are right on her heels- she 
swerves around, Khovansky comes up from behind to help, she shoots- aah, 
no good, Wilson easily deflects it.

&quot;Now it&#39;s back in Cocza&#39;s hands. This is a woman born and bred on 
soccer, folks. Raised in Brazil and currently studying music and 
athletics, she&#39;s solid through and through. Cocza takes it to Ramirez, 
Ramirez fades...back now to Omnerson- wait, here comes Beckett again! 
Beckett dives...wait, Wilson is moving somewhere. Does she think 
Carnegie&#39;s going to...HOLY MOLEY, was that Fleur Lacroix coming in from 
outta nowhere? Yes- she&#39;s completely aerodynamic today. Lacroix is 
flying like an arrow, takes the ball, makes a shot- BOOM, the goalie 
doesn&#39;t even budge! Lacroix hit her dead center and Wilson lives up to 
her nickname! Truly, this woman must be a tactical genius to see a play 
like that!

&quot;St. Thekla&#39;s got the ball now and they&#39;re going in deep. Andre and 
Khovansky are keeping a tight perimeter, but Hughes and Zweivalt keep 
them busy long enough for Omnerson to pass through. Khovansky&#39;s going 
straight for Omnerson, Zweivalt&#39;s keeping Andre busy...here comes Nguyen 
again, back for more- whoops, Threal&#39;s in on it now; she has the 
ball...one Shannon gunning for another...Hughes gets it back but- whoa, 
Threal sideswiped her and is taking it hard down the field! She&#39;s got 
Beckett and Lacroix at her side...Figeroa&#39;s coming in fast, but she 
can&#39;t seem to...there they go again! Beckett shoots but it&#39;s bad! Cocza 
easily intercepts, passes to Figeroa, she&#39;s going in far- Velur&#39;s got 
her, they fight for control- no, the ball&#39;s loose now! It&#39;s anybody&#39;s 
game. Cocza takes it, kicks it hard to Ramirez, Ramirez takes it all the 
way down to Zweivalt, Zweivalt shoots...oh, no good! Nazario takes it 
and doesn&#39;t give anything back! Wait, here comes Cocza and Figeroa 
again. They certainly don&#39;t give up. Nazario hits it hard down the field 
to Howlet, Howlet takes it again, driving it down the- hey, she shot 
again! Wilson stops it but she can&#39;t catch it! It&#39;s just sitting right 
there! She dives- WAIT, SHE DOVE IN THE OTHER DIRECTION!! She didn&#39;t go 
for the ball and the goal is wide open- THERE&#39;S BECKETT AGAIN!! She&#39;s 
got it, shoots...HOLY COW, what a hit! Wilson must&#39;ve seen that coming 
from a mile away, folks, because I don&#39;t know how else she could&#39;ve 
saved it!

&quot;Carnegie is playing wonderfully today, ladies and gentlemen, but St. 
Thekla&#39;s isn&#39;t letting their performance intimidate them. If anything, 
their game seems to have improved during the course of this match. Now 
Hughes has got the ball and is playing conservatively. Carnegie&#39;s got a 
tight defense with Threal and Nazario, but their weakest link is Nguyen 
and Tu. St. Thekla&#39;s might take advantage of their inexperience to pull 
out a surprise. Carnegie&#39;s best strength lies in its offense, as anyone 
who&#39;s watched Kasumi Beckett, Felicity Velur, Rain Howlet, and Nadia 
Khovansky can tell. These four women can go face-to-face with 
professional-level players. St. Thekla&#39;s either going to have to squeeze 
past them and strike their midfielders or beef up what defenses they 
have and rely on Wilson &#39;the Wall&#39; to catch those wild shots. Fifteen 
minutes left in the first half, score is still zero-zero.

&quot;Carnegie looks like it&#39;s starting to get serious now. Khovansky&#39;s 
driving it hard down St. Thekla&#39;s field, easily outmaneuvering their 
defensive line. She&#39;s meeting Omnerson and Hughes now...Vallan comes at 
her from behind, she passes to Andre...Lacroix wedges into the action, 
takes the ball, drives it; Vallan slides up and intercepts, Andre takes 
it back and shoots it, Khovansky knocks it with her head, Beckett picks 
up the slack...another shot, but it&#39;s lacking power. Wilson throws to 
Hughes, she takes it to Vallan and they ride past...no, Velur&#39;s got it 
and...wow, there she goes, folks! Felicity Velur&#39;s a regular Supergirl 
down there! I don&#39;t know where she&#39;s getting these bursts of energy, 
folks, but they&#39;ve worked for her before- OH, no, another save by 
Wilson! Carnegie&#39;s like a machine gun out here today, folks, and 
Wilson&#39;s not even fazed! You&#39;ve gotta wonder whether it&#39;s all sinking in 
or not: nothing gets past Shannon Wilson.

&quot;Now St. Thekla&#39;s on the offensive, and they&#39;re really running Carnegie 
ragged! They run past the offensive line just as Tu and Bguyen come up 
to intercept. Tu strikes...wow, she&#39;s got it! Cocza comes in and takes 
it like Tu was giving it away- no surprise from one of St. Thekla&#39;s 
best- down the line to Nazario and Threal...Cocza hesitates, gives it to 
Zweivalt, Zweivalt makes a shot...wait, here comes Ramirez again! A 
quick volley to Ramirez, right to Durante...it&#39;s no good! Not a 
particularly good offensive play, folks, but the first serious attempt 
at a goal by St. Thekla&#39;s today. You have to wonder if they&#39;re feeling 
bolder now with Wilson in top form. Now Carnegie has it again, Tu trying 
to take the lead after her last attempt. She&#39;s got everything under 
control so far- nope, there goes Zweivalt, and a quick pass to Figeroa- 
whoa, Tu strikes back! What a jump, folks! Isaac Newton himself would&#39;ve 
been surprised! That little firecracker almost jumped over the ball 
while it was in midair- now it&#39;s heading back to Khovansky, she knocks 
it to Howlet- whoops, Howlet&#39;s surrounded, she tries to fake right- OHH, 
Omnerson gave her a rough shove there, folks! The ref doesn&#39;t call it, 
though, and that&#39;s not making anyone out here pleased.

&quot;Omnerson relinquishes it to Vallan, Vallan shoots hard...here comes Tu 
again! Young Terra just won&#39;t give up, people! It&#39;s like she&#39;s taking 
this personally- no, Cocza got the ball again. That&#39;s the second time 
those two have clashed. Now she&#39;s taking it down to the goal line, 
Threal and Nazario come out- whoa, wait, where did Andre come from? I&#39;m 
serious, folks, even I didn&#39;t see her coming! She wrestles for control 
of the ball, takes it- now Vallan&#39;s got it- no, Andre took it back! Half 
of St. Thekla&#39;s team&#39;s on the wrong side of the field as Jennifer Andre 
goes for broke! Wilson looks ready...Andre gives it to Khovansky, 
Khovansky runs deep...look at that woman go! Khovansky shoots- no, wait, 
Ramirez took it back! Now Beckett and Velur are coming in to finish the 
job! Beckett takes it- ohh, not good! Kasumi Beckett misses by a mile 
and falls on the ground! What&#39;s happening down there? Is this the same 
girl people were calling &#39;the secret weapon of Washington, DC&#39;?

&quot;Velur picks up the slack and shoots. Wilson again. St. Thekla&#39;s 
regroups and Omnerson hit&#39;s the ball right over Beckett&#39;s head. Beckett 
doesn&#39;t look very well down there...there&#39;s just five minutes left, so 
the Coach might wait until halftime to trade her out. Figeroa has it 
now- wait, Nazario and Nguyen come out and take the offensive! They&#39;re 
running down the line, nobody&#39;s stopping them... Andre keeps watch over 
their flank...boy, they&#39;re going fast! Nguyen takes the ball now, 
Nazario keeps Cocza busy...Tu&#39;s returning to handle her old 
friend...Nguyen shoots...another miss! This might be the very first time 
that Amy Nguyen&#39;s tried to shoot, and despite Wilson&#39;s save, that was a 
pretty darn good shot if you ask me. Well, there&#39;s the bell: one down 
and one to go, Carnegie and St. Thekla still glaring at each other with 
zero-nothing. If one of them doesn&#39;t blink first, they&#39;ll have to go 
into penalty shots. We&#39;ve seen this happen a dozen times before, folks, 
and we all know where it goes. Let&#39;s just hope that Carnegie and Wilson 
can hang in there!&quot;

 

- Fausta Nazario, family: Alonza &amp; Maria; Piero &amp; Raul Nazario; sweeper-

 

Kasumi felt low as she entered the locker room, low enough to sit down 
on a bench and sulk. She knew what was at fault: she was still thinking 
about her parents, and her mother, and her sexuality, and the 
strangeness surrounding it all. She had wanted to think she was over 
this nonsense- that she could learn to accept it all, especially her 
sexuality, in time, and even be proud of it- but apparently not: it was 
affecting the way she played. Fausta gave her an angry look but nobody 
else seemed to notice.

&quot;Damn, she&#39;s good!&quot; Rain exclaimed. &quot;Every time, man! Every time! Not 
only does she catch it, but she moves to the exact spot the ball&#39;s 
heading! Every time!&quot;

&quot;We all saw it, Rain,&quot; Elisa said gently.

&quot;I&#39;m just saying that I&#39;m impressed, okay?&quot;

&quot;It does seem a little odd,&quot; Jennifer mused. &quot;Like, when Fleur tried to 
surprise her? I don&#39;t think either Lauren or Valencia could&#39;ve caught 
that, but she looked like she knew about it beforehand. Maybe even 
before Fleur did.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t say something so ridiculous!&quot; Fleur snapped. &quot;You make it 
sound as if she&#39;s clairvoyant.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she just got lucky,&quot; Alice offered. Fleur turned her nose up at 
the taller woman.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe in luck. Besides, she was in position before I kicked 
the ball.&quot;

&quot;Then how do you explain how she knew?&quot;

&quot;Ladies!&quot; Leena exclaimed loudly. &quot;A moment, please? Gather around.&quot; It 
didn&#39;t occur to the group how tired they were until they settled down 
and surrounded their coach. Although the beginners were starting to 
catch up in terms of skill and strength, everybody felt a little 
fatigued- psychologically if not physically. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to 
explain what Miss Wilson does,&quot; Leena said calmly, &quot;nor would I be able 
to venture a guess. All we know is that she&#39;s a good goalie, and we 
should step up our game to match hers. The rest of St. Thekla&#39;s team is 
giving us a healthy challenge, but it&#39;s nothing we can&#39;t handle so long 
as we keep our defenses tight. Beckett, are you going to be all right?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so, Coach. I&#39;ve been sloppy all day. I&#39;m kind of 
stressed.&quot;

&quot;You worked hard, Kasumi, and I&#39;m proud of what you&#39;ve done. You&#39;ve 
helped carry this team, and I&#39;m sorry if you feel burdened. I&#39;m going to 
put Khovansky in your place and Hawthorne in hers.&quot; Nadia paled and 
started waving her hands frantically.

&quot;Oh no, pleaze, you must not be doing that, I will not have better 
performance! I am not in working fair when put in important position! I 
will become breaking like tree branch!&quot;

&quot;If you can&#39;t handle that kind of pressure, Khovansky, then what are you 
doing here?&quot; Leena stared at her firmly, almost overbearing. Nadia 
turned red in humiliation and sunk her head. Felicity wanted to say 
something in her defense, but she and everyone there knew the coach was 
right. Nadia would have to get over her fears if she wanted to prove 
herself worthy of the team.

&quot;Get some rest,&quot; Leena sighed, putting her hand on Nadia&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;Take a few deep breaths and get some water. Everyone loses it from time 
to time. It&#39;s the only way we&#39;re tested. Now- before we head on back 
there, I&#39;d like to discuss possible strategies concerning the Wilson 
issue. I know from experience that there&#39;s no way she could be perfect; 
she has to have a weakness. What about wearing her out? Wilson&#39;s in 
decent shape, but she&#39;s no athlete. More like a dancer. I&#39;d recognize 
that type anywhere.&quot;

&quot;Yes, moved like ballerina,&quot; Nadia said.

&quot;We&#39;ve already tried pelting her with shot after shot,&quot; Rain said. &quot;She 
doesn&#39;t look like she&#39;s wearing out.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t really take her by surprise, either,&quot; Fleur added.

&quot;Hitting her with power shots doesn&#39;t do any good,&quot; Felicity noted.

&quot;Maybe if we tried confusing her,&quot; Terra said. &quot;Like, have two of us go 
up there, and one of us can hold the ball until the very end, then pass 
it to someone else. Like, I dunno, a lightning rebound.&quot;

&quot;Okay, good. Anything else?&quot; Rain raised her hand.

&quot;I could try angling it off the goalpost, then someone could run in and 
hit the ball when it&#39;s bounced off.&quot;

&quot;You sure you&#39;re focused enough for that?&quot; Fleur snorted.

&quot;What about you, Banjo Brown? Any thoughts? You do seem to be skeptical 
about her abilities.&quot; Fleur gave her a sour look before speaking.

&quot;I&#39;m just trying to be realistic here. You all have your heads in the 
clouds so much that it&#39;s a wonder they don&#39;t float off into space.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t speak for all of us,&quot; Fausta growled.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; Leena said coldly. She gestured for Fleur to continue.

&quot;I actually think we should try and wear her out. As Leena observed, she 
is not the athlete we are. She has more in common with Arina or Elisa: 
talented, sure, but no real skill. No offense, you two,&quot; she sang 
condescendingly.

&quot;Coach,&quot; said Arina, ignoring Fleur&#39;s slur, &quot;instead of putting Alice 
into the game, may I request you transfer me instead?&quot;

&quot;Any particular reason?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going about this the wrong way,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;We&#39;re of the 
mind that physicality will defeat her, when all it takes is a little 
psychological advantage. For example, when we hear that there&#39;s a goalie 
who can&#39;t be beaten, perhaps there&#39;s a subconscious part of our minds 
that believes this.&quot;

&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Lauren exclaimed. &quot;Arina, that&#39;s low, even for you!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s called the placebo effect,&quot; she answered calmly. &quot;If I gave you a 
sugar pill and told you it will cure your cold, would you get better? 
It&#39;s the exact same situation.&quot;

&quot;I still think that&#39;s a load of bull, Essylt. I don&#39;t care if someone 
thinks they&#39;re perfect, I&#39;m gonna beat their head in until I prove them 
wrong.&quot;

&quot;Barbaric, but you&#39;re on the right track. If we all believe that we can 
get just one ball through her, just one, it will happen. If we make 
certain victory the entirety of our actions- in short, if we will our 
futures according to what we want- then it will come to pass. Miss 
Wilson has been winning because she believes she can win. Now it&#39;s our 
turn.&quot;

&quot;What an asinine theory of yours,&quot; Fleur sighed. &quot;Honestly, Arina, I 
really thought you were better than this. Do you know what you just 
sounded like? One of these girls that watch those silly Japanese 
cartoons all day, then thinks they&#39;re living out those fantasies. Right- 
we&#39;ll really beat them with our thoughts and feelings.&quot;

&quot;You have nothing to lose,&quot; she answered with a wry smirk. &quot;If I&#39;m 
wrong, we&#39;ll try your plan. In any case, Miss Leena, please put me in 
Kasumi&#39;s position. I feel like I&#39;m finally ready to start contributing.&quot;

 

- Felicity Velur, family: Samuel Velur &amp; Katherine Brooks; forward-

 

&quot;This is a fine dilemma,&quot; Fleur pouted as the team returned to their 
positions. &quot;If we follow Arina&#39;s foolish idea, my pride as I know it 
will die. And if we lose...oh, god!&quot; she yelled, covering her face.

&quot;Who cares about your stupid pride?&quot; Jennifer snapped as she stretched. 
&quot;I just want to win. I don&#39;t care how we do it! Besides, if you&#39;re going 
to complain, you can switch places with Elisa or Alice.&quot;

&quot;That would also damage my pride,&quot; she retorted snobbishly.

&quot;Pride only hurts, it never helps. Ving Rhames, Pulp Fiction.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, get a life.&quot; Fleur rubbed her face and tried to brace herself. It 
was insulting, the way she lowered herself like this. Then again, she 
reasoned that she would lose face no matter which scenario she took, so 
the utilitarian in her chose to wish for victory, if only to have it- or 
to prove Arina wrong. St. Thekla&#39;s had the ball first and was heading 
for Jen. Arina chased after them, but was hopelessly outmatched, even by 
these mediocre performers; Nadia took the ball and sent it flying to 
Rain. She flew as far as the defensive midfield, then gave it to 
Felicity, who resumed command up to the goal. Arina closed her eyes and 
quickly wished for a score, but Wilson caught again, despite Velur&#39;s 
efforts.

&quot;What is she doing down there?&quot; Samuel Velur growled as he stared coldly 
at his daughter. &quot;She had every opportunity to score, and instead she 
practically let that goalie have the ball. I&#39;m going to have a few words 
to exchange with her once this is over.&quot;

&quot;What happened to Kasumi?&quot; said her mother. &quot;Why did the coach take her 
out all of a sudden?&quot;

&quot;She wasn&#39;t doing so well,&quot; Randy Beckett said flatly. &quot;I don&#39;t know 
what got into her, but she hasn&#39;t been playing like she usually does.&quot;

&quot;Do you think it&#39;s something we might&#39;ve said?&quot; Diana wondered. Randy 
shrugged; Sasha and Valerie Khovansky screamed.

&quot;[Take it home, Nadia! Drive it deep! Wait, pass! No- stop- wait- aha, 
there! That&#39;s it, go-go-go! Hit it hard! Make St. Thekla proud!]&quot;

&quot;Ay-yai, she&#39;s violent!&quot; Marina Durante gawked. &quot;Whatever happened to 
the sweet older sister I knew? What kind of person is this? She just 
jumped right out and landed on her face! Madre...at least she caught it, 
though.&quot;

&quot;Shannon the cannon! Shannon the cannon!&quot;

&quot;[I don&#39;t know where she gets it! I never experimented when I was her 
age! It&#39;s probably because of you and your sons! She only grew up with 
one woman in the house and she&#39;s overcompensating!]&quot;

&quot;[They&#39;re half your children too, Maria! Fausta has had plenty of 
chances to find role models. You made her too aggressive and 
independent; now she thinks she doesn&#39;t need a husband!]&quot;

&quot;[How else was she going to grow up in this world? I&#39;m sure that once 
she graduates, she&#39;ll quit this phase of hers and marry someone we can 
be proud of. It won&#39;t be forever!]&quot;

&quot;So Elisa just sits there and watches while all this is going on? I 
thought she joined this team to play.&quot;

&quot;You know her. She has so little confidence in herself that she&#39;d 
probably be too afraid to play. Oh- she&#39;s looking this way. Hello, 
Elisa, little bump on a log. I do wish she could go out for a few 
minutes, at least.&quot;

&quot;Those two are the forward and the striker, respectively. They&#39;re 
responsible for making most of the goals that win the games. Now the 
four in the middle are midfielders, the first line of defense. Their 
main job is to send the ball back to the forward and the striker, but 
they can also score.&quot;

&quot;Ohhh,&quot; said Ida von Hohenheim. &quot;I know the one in the net is the 
goalie, but which ones are those four?&quot;

&quot;No, Ida: say, &#39;what position do those four play&#39;.&quot; She repeated it and 
Alita cleared her throat. &quot;They are left and right back, stopper, and 
sweeper, the secondary line of defense. Their goal is to stop the ball 
before it can reach the net, and send it back to midfield. Usually they 
don&#39;t score.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Well, if too many of them run out for offense, there won&#39;t be anybody 
left to defend the goal.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So if there are...two, four, six...eight people keeping the ball 
away from the goal, how do those two in front score?&quot;

&quot;They cooperate with the players closest to them and run into the 
opponent&#39;s side. Most of the game is back-and-forth between both sides, 
as you can see, but sometimes they&#39;ll get aggressive and make a charge, 
usually accompanied by a few of their teammates. It&#39;s not hard to 
follow.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So why don&#39;t they try their hardest more often?&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;re smart enough to figure that on your own.&quot; Alita rubbed 
her young cousin&#39;s head and bit down on her lip, studying her younger 
sister. Freya wasn&#39;t having such a good day and could barely clap her 
hands. She decided to yell all the louder in her place, even though she 
didn&#39;t know anybody&#39;s names. &quot;All right, Carnegie, let&#39;s have some 
action! Keep that goalie guessing!&quot; Below on the field, the wearying 
players could not hear their families calling out to them, but many of 
them knew they were there, and sometimes that was good enough. Amy 
looked up into the sky, wondering if her mother, father, older brother, 
older sister, and younger sister were watching her. She swiftly took the 
ball away from Cocza and shot it far down the field, right into Arina&#39;s 
path. Every game she played was in dedication to their memory; she hoped 
they were proud of her.

Arina didn&#39;t have nearly the experience or the skill of her teammates, 
and it showed in the way she handled the ball. She managed to kick it 
wildly, and chased after it rather than swerving around with it nestled 
safe in her clutches. Hughes took it away from her but Felicity got it 
back; she raced down to the goal and stopped as three women blocked her 
path. Arina saw an opening and ran for it.

&quot;Felicity, over here!&quot; Velur looked her way and hesitated. Oh, why in 
the world did the coach allow this? It was one thing to give Arina a 
position, but making her a temporary striker threw everything off 
balance. Kasumi and Felicity could harmonize their approach and work 
together almost flawlessly, like a bow and arrow; this was more like a 
bow and nail file. Good thing Fleur showed up when she did, or Felicity 
might&#39;ve taken a big risk.

&quot;At least someone on the team has some sense!&quot; Lacroix muttered as she 
flew in from a vulnerable side. She thought she had a good shot, but 
Shannon Wilson proved her wrong once again. To make matters worse, she 
threw the ball farther than normal, and St. Thekla&#39;s turned aggressive 
and pounded Carnegie&#39;s defense. Nadia chased them but she was too late; 
Terra and Amy couldn&#39;t handle them; Valencia barely saved the day as 
another shot missed its mark. She tried not to look too pale as she 
threw the ball to Threal. Carnegie was still better all around, but St. 
Thekla&#39;s was improving quickly.

&quot;Next time, please give the ball to me,&quot; Arina said as she and Felicity 
returned to their positions. &quot;And trust me. Believe that we can win.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that easy,&quot; Felicity sighed. Arina made a face. The game 
rolled on for twenty more minutes, both sides staring at each other, 
ready to jump should the other one blink. Carnegie continued to pummel 
St. Thekla&#39;s defense but couldn&#39;t get past the Wilson barrier; St. 
Thekla&#39;s was a continuous thorn in their side that grew sharper and 
longer with each passing moment. Valencia looked a little winded. Arina 
was losing her patience. And the crowd was restless.

They began to chant: &quot;Wil-son! Wil-son! Wil-son! Wil-son!&quot; Helmuth 
Fitzgerald glanced at Stacie Rosewood coldly, wonder what she would do 
under this sort of pressure. The school&#39;s Dean looked on with an 
unyielding stare. Arthur Warren leaned forward in anticipation. Leena 
pursed her lips and clasped her hands together tightly.

&quot;Come on,&quot; she whispered, &quot;you can do it. I know you can.&quot; St. Thekla&#39;s 
was beginning to seriously harass Carnegie now. Amy was sideswiped and 
Terra was overrun. Fausta cursed violently as she missed catching a 
rogue shot, and Valencia got the wind knocked out of her as she saved 
the day again. Threal took the ball far but lost it as Cocza attacked 
again. Kasumi Beckett gnashed her teeth together and dried the angry 
tears from her eyes before they had a chance to fall. And Fleur 
Lacroix&#39;s day was just plain awful.

&quot;Give it here!&quot; she shouted as Jennifer ran towards her with a stolen 
prize. &quot;Let&#39;s see what Khovansky can do. I&#39;m not too proud to let others 
score! Don&#39;t choke, Bolshevik!&quot;

&quot;Am not communist!&quot; she spat as she took the ball away. Nadia kicked 
fiercely, forcing everyone to duck or else risk injury. Shannon saw it 
coming and jumped high in the air, catching something most professional 
goalies would&#39;ve missed. Nadia swore violently in two languages and was 
nearly flagged for it.

&quot;Don&#39;t let it get to you, Nadia!&quot; Shannon yelled.

&quot;Yeah, and at least your family came out to support you!&quot; Terra added. 
Nadia didn&#39;t feel much better but she tried to shake it off. Arina waved 
to get her attention.

&quot;Nadia, please give the ball to me. And wish with all your heart for our 
victory to come true. We have to be absolutely certain we&#39;re going to 
win.&quot;

&quot;I am sorry,&quot; she sighed glumly. Nadia pounded her palm with her fist, 
waved to the crowd, and blew a kiss to Elisa. &quot;Okay, I will be hoping 
for best result! Kitty and Jen hope too! Rain as well!&quot;

&quot;All right, we&#39;re gonna kick ass no matter what!&quot; Howlet yelled.

&quot;And why stop at just one goal?!&quot; Jennifer grinned.

&quot;What next?&quot; Fausta groaned, covering her face in humiliation. She 
suddenly spotted Ramirez coming straight for her, and resigned herself 
to this ludicrous task. &quot;Oh, fine, to hell with it! I&#39;ll try anything 
now!&quot;

&quot;Nazario captures the ball from Ramirez, drives it down the field. She 
swerves around Figeroa...passes to Andre...Andre fakes a right and sends 
it flying to Khovansky...here comes Hughes and Vallan. Khovansky makes 
for the goal...maybe she&#39;s going to try another shot. You have to wonder 
how many times Carnegie&#39;s going to try this. They get points for 
persistence in my book! Zweivalt joins her teammates in an assault on 
Khovansky- wait, she&#39;s sending the ball to Essylt! We haven&#39;t seen 
anything special from this one, folks, so I&#39;m wondering if maybe they 
have something up their sleeves. Essylt doesn&#39;t stack up to the other 
players, and trading her in for Beckett might&#39;ve been a poor choice. 
Velur&#39;s got her back...now here comes Howlet...there&#39;s only two minutes 
left in the game, and it looks like Carnegie&#39;s going for one last 
offensive. We&#39;ve seen this before, folks, and so has Wilson! Just look 
at that smile on her face! You know she can see this one coming, too.&quot;

&quot;No she can&#39;t,&quot; Arina murmured, as she closed her eyes and relied on 
blind faith to carry her. She envisioned herself approaching Wilson, 
that smug expression still on her face, crouched and ready to preserve 
her legend. Arina&#39;s self-loathing turned into pure optimism, and she 
imagined herself as an unstoppable force of nature- more like a presence 
than a being- something that had the audacity to run up against what 
seemed to be a certain future, and defy it.

I don&#39;t believe in predetermined destinies. We make our own through our 
will and our actions. If I want to win this game, then I&#39;m going to DO 
IT! Whether you can really see the future or not is no longer relevant. 
I have the future with me right now, and I&#39;m the one who&#39;ll decide what 
it is!!

Arina imagined that Wilson wouldn&#39;t even be able to move, and that the 
ball would sail undeterred into the net. All of Carnegie was with her as 
she made her dream come true.

 

The entire stadium was dead silent for a moment as they sat in awe at 
what had just happened. None more so than Shannon Wilson.

 

&quot;Ah...ah...I...I don&#39;t buh...believe it,&quot; the announcer stuttered. 
&quot;It...doesn&#39;t seem possible, but...OH MY GOD!!! LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DO 
YOU SEE THAT?! SHANNON WILSON MISSED THE BALL!! SHANNON WILSON MISSED! 
CARNEGIE HAS DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE! All of St. Thekla&#39;s- the entire 
stadium- they&#39;re so stunned that they can&#39;t even move! The game ends and 
Carnegie...Carnegie wins over St. Thekla&#39;s, one to nothing!! I don&#39;t 
mean to use a clich&eacute;, but...do you believe in miracles!?&quot;

The crowd was either on their feet roaring or blanched and gawking in 
disbelief. The girls of Carnegie rushed around Arina, hugging her and 
throwing her on their shoulders. Fleur flopped onto the ground shakily. 
Leena burst into tears. Amy raised her fists to the sky. The announcer 
was laughing. Even Fitzgerald smirked. There was no doubt in anybody&#39;s 
minds that they had witnessed something spectacular.

As for Shannon Wilson... She stood petrified and dumb at her post, the 
wind gently tickling her yellow hair and the sinking feeling of defeat 
and despair pulling down on her. Her friends and teammates were stricken 
as well, but recovered once Carnegie came over and congratulated them on 
a wonderful game. She was left by herself, saturating in what had 
transpired, lost and alone.

(Princess Nine song)

&quot;I failed,&quot; Shannon whispered, grasping her forehead. Suddenly, a voice 
called out to her from behind, like a robin&#39;s song amidst winter, or the 
gush of water in the desert, or the chime of love amidst gloom. It was a 
sound she had heard before, once, long ago, in a time and place she 
thought had been naught but a dream.

&quot;Shannon?&quot; She was already crying but now the tears turned into awe, and 
hope. She turned around shakily, and saw the very last person she ever 
hoped to see again, her guiding light and strength, her dearest friend 
and confidante, her one true love, lost to her and now found. She saw 
Xing-En Lee.

The two star-crossed souls didn&#39;t say a word as they stared at each 
other across that small distance, one weeping and the other glowing with 
love. That moment in time seemed so impossible and remote that even 
Wilson, with her abilities, never thought it would happen; she wondered 
if she could dare to dream even now.

(finish)

 

They ran into each other&#39;s arms and embraced passionately, reunited once 
more, silent and overflowing with joy. Upon that day, Carnegie may have 
won the game, but Shannon Wilson had the ultimate victory in the end.
