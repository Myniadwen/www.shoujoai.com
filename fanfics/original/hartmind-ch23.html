<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 23 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>Over the next week Sam caught a glimpse of Star every now and then, 
keeping her distance for fear of what might happen if they came in 
contact with each other. Beth had the same lunch hour with them as well 
as Star so she spent her lunches apart from Trish and Sam for the time 
being. This saddened Trish slightly, but she spent much of the time with 
Sam, trying to keep the girl&#39;s mind off the nightmare that was closing 
upon them. As the days passed all three girls became more and more 
uneasy and it showed. They began looking over their shoulders as they 
walked down the street, fearing that Star&#39;s father could be watching 
them at any moment. Even though Trish and Sam knew that the man would 
not be after them they still could not help feeling a bit paranoid 
knowing a killer was stalking the streets. Then the week before Sam&#39;s 
birthday she saw him. 

&quot;Trish...&quot; She nudged her friend as Trish looked over a t-shirt at the 
front of one of the shops in the mall. 

Trish glanced up at her friend and saw the frightened look in her eyes, 
&quot;What is it?&quot; She scanned around in search of what had caught her 
friend&#39;s attention when she saw him. He was sitting in the food court, 
not far from where they stood, eating a burger as he read the newspaper, 
&quot;Shit, is that him?&quot; She inquired anxiously.

Sam nodded, her fist clenched into fists, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; She quickly turned 
away from the man and started out of the mall. 

Trish raced after her friend, glancing over her shoulder a couple of 
times at the man, &quot;Oh my god, I can&#39;t believe he&#39;s really here. I mean I 
knew this day would come, but I never thought we would run into him 
before the final day.&quot; 

Sam shakily tried to put the key in her bike lock and failed, &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe he had the guts to just sit there in the open like that.&quot; She 
suddenly stood and looked around, &quot;Did Beth say she was bring Star to 
the mall today?&quot; 

Trish shook her head, &quot;They were going to the movies at West Mall.&quot; She 
stated with certainty. 

Sam continued to glance around her, &quot;What about her mother? Star&#39;s 
mother?&quot; 

Trish shrugged, &quot;I don&#39;t know. We have only been keeping an eye on Star. 
She could be anywhere.&quot; 

Sam felt panicked and started to head back to the mall, &quot;We have to see 
if she is here.&quot; 

Trish grabbed the girl by the hand, &quot;Then what?&quot; She insisted, &quot;He is 
not going to do anything for another couple of days so calm down. If you 
make a scene now he will know we&#39;ve spotted him and all of our plans 
will be ruined.&quot; 

Sam punched at the door in frustration, &quot;I can&#39;t believe we have to just 
let him sit there like that. I feel so helpless.&quot; She let out a tired 
sigh and sat down upon one of the railings that bordered the walkway to 
the entrance. 

Trish set a hand upon her shoulder and squeezed it lightly, &quot;We have no 
choice, but now we know for sure he is here. We are one step ahead of 
him so lets keep it that way.&quot; 

Sam took one final look at the mall and gave a nod of agreement, then 
snarled at the building, &quot;I&#39;ll make him regret ever coming after my 
Star.&quot;
