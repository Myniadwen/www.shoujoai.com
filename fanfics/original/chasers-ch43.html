<a href="../original/chasers-ch42.html">Back to Part 42</a><pre>&quot;All right, let&#39;s get those &#39;copters in the air,&quot; Kate
Williams roared out orders, the sandy blonde haired
woman scowling as she stood on the ramp, the darkened
towers stretching up all around the cluster of
officers.

Nearby several officers broke out the mini-helicopters
from their crates, their heavy flight gear making them
all look sort of fat and clumsy as they climbed into
their seats. With a soft hum of power the large rotors
started up and the officers were off, soaring up to
investigate the powerless upper levels of the massive
city.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; a young man ran up, the collar of his uniform
coat turned up to try to cut out the cold, &quot;looting
has been reported in Lowtown.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Kate scowled, &quot;is it a surprise?&quot; She looked
him over, &quot;Strife, right?&quot;

The white haired officer nodded, a unlit cigarette
dangling from his mouth. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; he nodded, &quot;do we
have anyone we can send to help?&quot;

Kate grit her teeth in annoyance, silently wondering
how the hell she had ended up in charge in the first
place. She had just been headed out to a friend&#39;s New
Years party when the first bombs went off, then like
everyone else had found herself stranded. Climbing up
emergency ladders she had made it to this police
station to find it chaotically disorganized, no
commanders available and without thinking had stepped
in.

&quot;With the lift system dead? Not a chance in hell,&quot;
Kate scowled. &quot;Do we have a radio link running?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Off and on,&quot; Strife handed it over then rushed over
to help pull people out of a malfunctioning lift
nearby.

Kate pressed the switch and said crisply, &quot;This is
Williams, Detective Third Class, who&#39;s in charge down
there?&quot;

&quot;I guess that&#39;d be me,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice answered,
&quot;Lt. Jessica Storm. Things are getting pretty crazy
down here, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Get your people together and hold up until we can get
you relieved,&quot; Kate made a snap decision, swiftly
weighing their options in her mind.

&quot;And let the looters run free?&quot; Jessica blurted.

&quot;Without the city powergrid half your equipment won&#39;t
even run,&quot; Kate explained, &quot;and stun guns and riot
gear won&#39;t cut it against a mob, they&#39;ll just
overwhelm you. No, we just have to cut our losses for
now and try to clean up the aftermath.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Jessica sounded much more agreeable. She
hesitated, &quot;I can&#39;t get through to City hall, is there
anything wrong?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Kate admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve got one eye
witness report they were hit, too, but no other
confirmation yet.&quot;

There was a long moment of dead silence as Jessica
processed that piece of depressing information. &quot;Thank
you, ma&#39;am, then I hope we hear from you soon,&quot; she
said to Kate stiffly before she signed off.

&quot;I hope so, too,&quot; Kate muttered.

Suddenly there was a soft squeal of static from their
various communications devices as a all bands notice
went out. &quot;This is Section Chief Gwen Musashi from
police headquarters to all units, we&#39;re switching to
frequency 229 for all command broadcasts. Report in
unit status and equipment resources immediate,
please,&quot; she said before hanging up.

&#39;Frequency 229,&#39; Kate blinked, &#39;that&#39;s what the
Chasers use. Does that mean she&#39;s set up a command
center there?&#39; Shaking off her surprise she turned to
her troops and barked, &quot;You heard her, we need a tally
of people and gear ASAP! Go go!&quot;

As her troops rushed to work Kate&#39;s phone chimed
softly. Answering it she heard Gwen&#39;s voice, &quot;Kate,
where are you?&quot;

&quot;29th and Blake, level 55 police station,&quot; Kate
answered, &quot;we just heard your broadcast. What are you
up to, boss?&quot;

&quot;That explains it,&quot; Gwen sounded amused, &quot;Beth was
wondering why that station was more active than most
on the emergency network. You took charge?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t have a lot of choice,&quot; Kate answered flatly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen sounded faintly amused. &quot;We&#39;ve got a
secondary command center going here,&quot; she said, &quot;we&#39;ll
coordinate emergency responses from now on.&quot;

&quot;That legal?&quot; Kate asked.

&quot;No, but I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s going to argue it,&quot;
Gwen answered.

&quot;Has Jen checked in yet?&quot; Kate asked, feeling
confident that the other officer would find a way to
do so.

&quot;Jen was with her family, but is on her way back to
headquarters,&quot; Gwen reported. She added with some
amusement, &quot;Your cousin is here, by the way.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Kate blurted.

&quot;Miss Naru made her way here once the power went,&quot;
Gwen said with amusement, &quot;she was concerned about
you.&quot; After a moment she said, &quot;No comment?&quot;

&quot;Not sure what to say,&quot; Kate admitted, &quot;can you keep
an eye on her?&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Gwen responded. Regretfully she continued,
&quot;I have to go, we need to keep most of the lines open
for emergencies.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try to keep things under control here,&quot; Kate
agreed the they signed off.

In the Chasers computer core the sound of muffled
cursing was heard beneath the main consoles, a woman&#39;s
bottom wiggling as she worked. &quot;God damned piece
of...&quot; Beth Harris started, then a crackle of
electricity was heard as the module slapped into
place. Not leaving her spot she called out the order,
&quot;Naru, give it some juice!&quot;

The tall, black haired woman hit the on switch as
instructed, watching as a three dimensional map
appeared in midair. Large sections of it were blacked
out but that was fine, it clearly was working. &quot;It&#39;s
on,&quot; Naru reported.

Beth grunted as she climbed out then sat beside Naru
in the main control chair, pressing keys as she ran
standard checks. &quot;Looks like it&#39;s as bad as we
thought,&quot; the redhead said grimly as she looked up at
the map.

Gwen Musashi went down the dimly lit hall into the
brightly lit main core, the elegantly dressed Asian
woman answering the question herself. &quot;Barely ten
percent of the city has power at this point,&quot; she
noted. She gave Naru a smile, &quot;I finally reached Kate,
she&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;Thank god,&quot; Naru sighed.

&quot;I&#39;m rather surprised Kate hasn&#39;t mentioned you,&quot; Gwen
said diplomatically.

&quot;My side of the family only learned of Kate&#39;s
existence a few months ago,&quot; Naru said as she got up
to walk over to a coffee machine in the corner, &quot;and
to be honest, she wasn&#39;t terribly happy to hear from
us.&quot;

&quot;Kate&#39;s a pretty private person,&quot; Beth said as she hit
a few controls, monitoring and directing emergency
services, &quot;so I&#39;m not too surprised, honestly.&quot;

&quot;I was,&quot; Naru sighed. She looked amused, &quot;I think my
parents were pretty shocked when the private
investigator reported back that her reply to our
overtures was, &#39;Go away.&#39; &quot;

Beth chuckled and Gwen had to fight back a smile. Naru
carried over a coffee for Beth and her and Gwen said,
&quot;You really don&#39;t have to do this.&quot;

Naru shrugged, &quot;I don&#39;t see a lot of staff around here
to help out while you try to get the city running
again.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s got a point,&quot; Beth bit her bottom lip in worry,
&quot;we can&#39;t even track down Julie.&quot;

Gwen thought about it a moment then nodded firmly.
&quot;All right, if only because here is safer than out on
the street,&quot; she said.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Naru smiled.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be keeping you busy,&quot; Beth
answered as she considered all of the things they&#39;d
have to do to help get things back to normal.</pre>
