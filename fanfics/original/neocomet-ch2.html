~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Setsuya grinned devilishly at his former training partner, his long time 
rival. Aarin Highland. It had been two years since they had last seen 
each other, but if Setsuya&#39;s memory was accurate, then Aarin hadn&#39;t 
changed much. Still blonde, still quiet, still fashionably late. While 
Setsuya couldn&#39;t stop smiling, Aarin&#39;s face was still as cold as stone. 
He had been waiting for this for a long time. Two years. Two whole 
years. And not once during that time, did Aarin have a half decent 
challenge to test his sword skills. It was the shameful truth. Setsuya 
was the only swordfighter on earth that could give him a true challenge. 
And after waiting for so long, that is exactly what he would get. 

After a few seconds of silence went by, Setsuya decided to speak for the 
two of them. &quot;What&#39;s up, Aarin? What brings you to this neck of the 
woods, eh?&quot;

The small gusts of wind around Aarin&#39;s feet began to die down a little. 
&quot;Do not joke.&quot; He said bluntly. &quot;You know exactly why I am here. Because 
you are here for the same reason.&quot;

Setsuya nodded. &quot;Yup. To send off the master, and to pay our respects in 
the process. But I doubt that&#39;s the only thing you&#39;ve come here for... 
right?&quot;

If Aarin could smile, he would have. &quot;Yes... I assume you have the same 
problems as me?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t find a good challenge?&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot; Aarin uttered. &quot;Your deductions are sharp. Lets just see if 
your skills have followed the same path!&quot; 

The wind around Aarin&#39;s feet picked up again, as he lifted his sword 
into the air. Like lightning, he spread out his feet and steadied his 
position, tightening his grip around the hilt of his blade. In an 
instant, Aarin span around on his heels, branching out his 
sword-wielding arm in a spinning motion. The blade cut through the air 
quickly, rending molecules and stray traces of dust, but not Setsuya. 

The dark-haired man swiftly jumped off the ground, sailing over Aarin&#39;s 
horizontal slice, clutching at the hilt of his own sword as he travelled 
through the air. Setsuya flipped over in a quick motion, then landed a 
few metres from Aarin. He landed in a crouching position, his head 
lowered, then slowly his head rose, pulling back the locks of dark black 
hair out of his eye line. 

Aarin took note of the grin he saw on Setsuya&#39;s face, watching his 
movements keenly. 
While Aarin stood away, watching him, Setsuya stood, drawing his 
sleeping sword out of its confining sheath at his waist. It was time for 
this. Instantly (upon drawing his sword) Setsuya rushed toward his rival 
Aarin, holding sword in a lower diagonal dragging position, the tip of 
her blade facing behind. His sword dragged along the ground in a streak 
of static, making a vivid &#39;clish&#39; sound as his feet pushed him across 
the courtyard. As Setsuya ran towards him, Aarin brought up his sword, a 
new gust of wind booming around the courtyard as he did so. The two 
swordfighters were before each other once more, and as Setsuya swung his 
sword forwards to strike, Aarin brought his around to counter this 
motion. The two swords of the fighters crashed against each other, the 
sound of the impact echoing into the dense buildings surrounding the 
courtyard, and frightening the restless crows perched on the rooftops of 
those said buildings. 

Setsuya and Aarin withdrew their swords from that clash, and attacked 
each other in that same way once more. A swing from Setsuya&#39;s blade came 
at Aarin&#39;s neck. Upon his instinctive desires, Aarin&#39;s body swerved out 
of the way from the waist up, lashing his thick ponytail of blonde hair 
around the frame of his cranium. Aarin&#39;s upper torso leaned backward, 
under Setsuya&#39;s viciously moving sword. Rather than grumble on his lack 
of position to strike, the Englishman capitalized on this, by launching 
his leg out. Setsuya was unprepared for this, and lost his balance as 
Aarin&#39;s brown-shoed foot rammed into his ankles. Setsuya dipped 
forwards, stumbling along as Aarin slithered back up into a better 
position. He lifted his windy sword into the air above his head, and 
then grabbed onto it with his other hand. A grounded Setsuya looked up 
to see Aarin about to bring his sword down on him, and leapt into 
alertness. Using one of his arms as support for his body, Setsuya 
balanced himself off the ground and deflected Aarin&#39;s overhead blow with 
the back of his sword. The swinging motion was so swift and powerful 
that the force of it knocked Aarin&#39;s sword back, though the blonde 
managed to maintain a grip on it. 

Setsuya saw his chance and span upwards to gain from Aarin&#39;s distraction 
thrusting his sword upward, stabbing through the air with all of his 
speedy skill. Aarin didn&#39;t wait to long to follow, and preformed the 
same move in a downward, lowering variation. The two halted as both 
their swords came within a centimetre&#39;s range of the other&#39;s throat. For 
a short while, the two just stood there like that, the sword of one 
ready to bloodily skewer the neck of the other. Then, after a short 
pause, the two Yuuga swordfighters smiled at one and other. 

Setsuya withdrew his sword and stood up. 

&quot;Sweet. I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d still be this much of a challenge after two 
whole years. You&#39;ve been eating your vitamins, alright...&quot;

Aarin withdrew his blade also, sheathing it. &quot;Is that your way of saying 
that I am still in top form? Then you are right. And I admit... that you 
are too. But... I am surprised that you didn&#39;t use any of your energy.&quot;

Setsuya rubbed his nose arrogantly. &quot;Me? Heh, heh! Not likely! Not 
unless you want this place blown up in smoke.&quot;

Aarin nodded, remembering just how destructive the Chi of a Yuuga 
swordfighter could be. &quot;I think we would be better off conserving our 
full strength. For now. We still have to finish our duel.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. Plus... Yurunosuke isn&#39;t really after any battles in the school 
right now. He gave me orders not to start anything. But you know how it 
is with orders and me. I can&#39;t follow &#39;um worth a damn.&quot;

&quot;So Yurunosuke is here?&quot; Aarin asked. &quot;I suppose I should greet everyone 
then.&quot;

Setsuya shook his head, sheathing his sword and placing his hand on 
Aarin&#39;s shoulder. &quot;That can wait, my friend. We need time to catch up 
and get up to speed. It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Sendou-rin Ramen shop, Osaka, Neo-Japan

True to his word, Setsuya and Aarin decided to get re-acquainted with 
each other. The last time they had seen each other was the day they both 
left the Yuuga school of Sword Arts, two years ago. A lot had gone down 
in that time, most evident of all was the death of their sword master. 
While Setsuya left to explore the rest of the world, Aarin left the 
compound to find a better sword. One that would put him on equal terms 
with his rival. And after constant searching, trudging through market 
after market, seeing arms dealer after arms dealer, Aarin finally found 
the weapon that suited him best. The sword that gave him a real chance 
at surpassing Setsuya. 

The two swordfighters of Yuuga School left the training hall and took a 
short walk into Osaka. Like the rest of the cites inside the Japanese 
Safe-Zone, Osaka was bristling with life and vigour. Many people 
scattered across the city relished the nightlife and glamour, while 
others remained faithful to the aging Shinto beliefs and maintained the 
shrine created in Pre-Impact Japan. But this indulgence was hollow and 
meaningless. In the torn world that was 2081, life was short and hard. 
Which meant that you had to enjoy it while you had it. When death was 
constantly hanging over your shoulders, it was only natural to enjoy 
what little you have. 

Shortly after they left the training school, Setsuya and Aarin came to a 
small ramen shop, known as Sendou-rin. Back in his days as a young 
trainee at the school, Setsuya always snuck out to partake of the fine 
noodle dishes here. Aarin didn&#39;t care much for Japanese foods but he had 
eaten them before, this time would be no different or anymore harsh. 

The two took a seat at the front of the shop, below the overhanging 
banner of the shop, scripted with the Kanji for Sendou-rin. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Setsuya yelled for the attention of the cook standing behind the 
counter. &quot;I&#39;ll have an order of ramen over here, throw in some pork and 
don&#39;t be skimpy with the ground pepper.&quot; 

Then he looked at Aarin. &quot;What are you having?&quot;

Aarin just sighed indifferently. &quot;Whatever.&quot;

Nodding, Setsuya looked over at the cook and spoke again. &quot;The same for 
my friend here.&quot;

The cook nodded, trying hard to ignore Setsuya&#39;s rudeness. &quot;Gotcha. 
That&#39;ll be about ten minutes, gentlemen.&quot;

The cook of the ramen place scrambled round the back to prepare the 
bowls of noodles for the two. While he got to work, Setsuya span around 
on his seat, facing the road and looked up into the starry night sky. No 
matter what happened to the planet, the sky would always be beautiful. 

Though Setsuya spoke, he didn&#39;t look away from the stars hanging above. 
&quot;So... what have you been doing with yourself all this time?&quot; 

Aarin slouched a little, still facing forward. &quot;That&#39;s not hard to 
answer, really. I&#39;ve been searching for a better blade. A weapon that I 
could be proud to call my own.&quot;

Setsuya grinned. &quot;Let me guess. You&#39;ve got a thing for travelling across 
the world to pick up a weapon?&quot; 

Unusual as it was, Aarin managed to smile. &quot;I suppose it really *isn&#39;t* 
that simple. In truth, I believed that I could improve upon my skills if 
I got a stronger weapon to fight with. And fate brought me to this.&quot;

Aarin&#39;s fingers rubbed along the sheath of his new sword. It was a 
broadsword, a much more sleek than Aarin&#39;s old Claymore, and its design 
was positively beautiful. Almost unearthly. 

Setsuya frowned, shutting his eyes. &quot;Y&#39;know, a sword doesn&#39;t make the 
man, the man makes the sword. Any strength you obtain, its because of 
your own skills and desire. The weapon is just an extension, as the 
master would have said. Still...&quot;

Setsuya&#39;s blue eyes opened and he showered Aarin&#39;s sword with curious 
glances. &quot;That&#39;s one sweet blade you&#39;ve got there. Better take care of 
it.&quot;

&quot;I assure you, I will.&quot; Aarin confirmed. &quot;So what have you been doing? 
Counting the days?&quot;
&quot;Ha, ha.&quot; Setsuya said sarcastically. &quot;I&#39;ve been training. And I&#39;ve been 
on the move. Exploring the world, seeing sights, running in bounties, 
and corrupting innocent women. I&#39;ve always been a bit of a 
heartbreaker.&quot; 

Aarin rolled his eyes. &quot;You satisfy your loins when you could be 
improving upon your skills. That is just like you, Setsuya.&quot;

&quot;Hey, to deny physical attraction is to deny the one thing left 
untouched in this screwed up world. Besides, lifetime expectancy says I 
only have about 11 years left to live. Might as well make the most of 
it. Even if I can&#39;t do anything to help the world.&quot;

Aarin snorted indignantly. &quot;Makes me wonder. Is there really anything 
worthwhile in this world? What&#39;s... what&#39;s the point of it all when it&#39;s 
all beyond redemption?&quot;

Setsuya looked over at Aarin from the corner of his eye. &quot;I happen to 
agree with you. Life is weak, and easy to lose. Makes it pointless to 
exist. But still... I can&#39;t believe that the people left should have to 
suffer like this. They deserve a better world than this... something we 
won&#39;t get but... at least we can set it on its way.&quot;

&quot;When did you appoint yourself as the world&#39;s overseer?&quot; Aarin asked 
challengingly. &quot;I thought that enjoying yourself was key?&quot;

&quot;That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t care what happens. If I could do 
something, don&#39;t think that I wouldn&#39;t. We&#39;re not all stone hearted 
here, y&#39;know.&quot;

Aarin lowered his eyes. &quot;I... want to care... but...&quot;

&quot;No, I understand.&quot; Setsuya said. &quot;Its ironic. Yurunosuke and me were 
talking about the exact same thing. He has faith but I&#39;m still curious 
about how things will get better. I know one thing though, things won&#39;t 
get better if we hide behind crap like religion.&quot; 

Aarin smirked. &quot;Another thing we disagree on.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you believe in all that?&quot; Setsuya said disbelievingly. 

&quot;...I&#39;m not sure.&quot; Aarin said. &quot;If there is a supreme master, I&#39;d want 
to know why all this happened. And what purpose my life has. But if it 
makes people happier... I suppose it&#39;s only natural for them to attach 
themselves to it.&quot;

Setsuya sighed, dropping his arms to his side. &quot;I guess we&#39;re both 
searching for something we lack, eh?&quot;

&quot;I would appear so.&quot; Aarin agreed. &quot;I need a reason to care more, and 
you need a little more faith in what&#39;s left of humanity.&quot;

&quot;I dunno if I can do that. But for now, I&#39;m just gonna go with the flow. 
Soon as the funeral is over, I&#39;m going back to China to meet up with 
someone special to me. What about you?&quot;

Aarin thought about it. &quot;I am... not sure. I suppose I will...&quot;

&quot;You have plenty of time to think about it.&quot; Setsuya said. &quot;And I don&#39;t 
think Yurunosuke will mind if you stay at the compound for a little 
while longer.&quot;

Just then, the cook arrived with two steaming ramen bowls in each hand, 
placing them both before Aarin and Setsuya. &quot;Dig in, gentlemen! That&#39;ll 
be 14 credits.&quot;

&quot;Finally!&quot; With a watering mouth, Setsuya quickly handed over a couple 
notes to the cook and stuck into his meal. Aarin, breaking apart two 
chopsticks, followed suit, using the two wooden sticks to slurp a ration 
of noodles into his mouth. No matter what happened in the future, it was 
for the future. Aarin would focus on the here and now, even if it meant 
hunching over a bowl of ramen.

Highland Mansion, Manchester, Neo-England

In a large room, furnished richly with fine things and decorated with a 
rich man&#39;s touch, a solitary girl shined off something you&#39;d never 
expect a rich girl to wear. 
A suit of armour. 

Not just any old suit of armour, it was actually quite significant. A 
replica of a suit of armour made back in 11th Century England. The girl 
was currently wearing a long satin white dress; her hair left hanging 
loose in a waterfall of soft blonde. And as she finished polishing the 
chest plate of her armour, her baby blue eyes gleamed with cheer and 
happiness. It was fitting. Anything that was to be worn by Ingrid 
Highland in battle was going to have to look good. Not that it mattered 
much. What Ingrid really wanted only her brother Aarin could provide. 

A rematch.

Though she was very different to Aarin, the two similarities that they 
had were contempt for the aristocracy and a desire for the sword. Ingrid 
had been drawn to the sword all her life. When Aarin left for Neo-Japan 
and became a swordsman, Ingrid knew what her purpose was. To become the 
world&#39;s greatest swordswoman. It was a difficult idea however. Most 
sword masters in England were extremely misogynistic. They would just 
laugh women out of their training halls most of the time. After a great 
struggle, Ingrid found a willing teacher, named Roundsman. He was pretty 
skilled, to boot. 

After a strenuous training session, Ingrid developed the skills that 
Roundsman believed she could obtain. Then finally, Ingrid realized that 
being a swordswoman is what she wanted to do. Her ultimate goal. To 
become to greatest swordfighter alive. And in the process, she would 
surpass her brother, Aarin. 

Soon after Ingrid&#39;s training, Aarin returned to England. Though she was 
happy to see her brother, what she really wanted was a battle with him 
to test her skills. Eventually, even though Aarin was reluctant, he 
agreed to this, and the two did battle. 
Ingrid was defeated. 

Aarin left Neo-England, leaving Ingrid behind with wave after wave of 
questions. 

&#39;Why did I lose?&#39;

&#39;What more can I learn?&#39;

&#39;Will I ever become the strongest swordswoman?&#39;

Ingrid searched herself, knowing that she could not answer her worries. 
However, one day, while she was walking through one of the markets in 
the city, a strange man dressed in dark black robes confronted Ingrid. 
He offered her a sword, a rather powerful sword that was called 
&#39;Lightning Tooth&#39;. It possessed great power, strong enough to rival the 
strength of Aarin&#39;s blade. Knowing this, Ingrid gratefully received the 
sword and decided that she would confront her brother once more, and 
defeat him.

Fire burned in Ingrid&#39;s eyes. &quot;Brother! I will defeat you!&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Bio-Technological Research Department (Neo-Japan Branch), Nagoya

Simon McAmish had been right about one thing. 

The Bio-Technological Research Department of Nagoya was no reflection of 
modern society. It was fully decked out with the technologies and 
designs of the Pre-Comet scientific world. Right from the pallid white 
of the walls and the hi-tech automatic doors, to the tight security 
systems and surveillance cameras. It was full of miniature labs that 
were meshed together to create one gigantic lab, half of it in plain 
view, the other half deep underground. The two sections of the lab were 
connected to each other by means of an elevator. That was Ayame&#39;s target 
to reach before she could hope to get near the lower part of the 
Research Facility. The Dark Katana stood poised in one of the many 
simplistically long corridors of the grounds. It was morning. Last night 
she had met up with the Scottish foreigner, Simon McAmish at the 
nightclub, Black Star. They had talked over what they both wanted. Simon 
wanted a mission taken care of. To rescue his daughter. And Ayame spoke 
with cash worries. And they quickly came to an agreement. With the first 
instalment of her payment given upfront, Ayame was duty bound to find 
and rescue the daughter of Simon, and her name was Julia. Once that had 
been agreed on, Ayame left the club to return to her apartment to get 
some shuteye. After all, one thing she had learned was that taking on 
dangerous missions was a bad idea if you weren&#39;t well rested. She had 
come to understand that lesson the hard way. As soon as morning hit, 
Ayame took a shower, had something to eat, got dressed and left for the 
Bio-Technological Research Department. Simon had given her the details 
for the location but it wasn&#39;t too far out of the city. 

A few years ago, Ayame was knee-deep in the gang land battle between two 
crime lords over a weapons deal. Throughout all of that chaos, she had 
acquired a motorcycle. A cycle that had been built before the landing of 
the Genesis Comet, which was very rare. It still worked like a charm, 
and Ayame had christened it &#39;Megumi-chan&#39;. That very same bike had taken 
Ayame to the Research Facility. The drive itself was not that long, only 
a hour or so, but it took her outside of the city as a whole. So far 
that the outer grasslands were the main topic of view outside of the 
lab. Now Ayame was inside the place. She had snuck in easily enough, and 
as long as she stayed one step ahead of the security cameras, she was 
safe. There was a significant lack of man-power in this place too. Ayame 
could estimate that there was about fifty scientists working here. And 
maybe ten or so men working as security guards. That number was quite 
small considering the great size of this place, but not surprising. The 
overall population of the world was nearly four times smaller than it 
was 30 years ago, thanks to the Genesis Comet. So a labour shortage was 
almost certain to be an issue with almost every company and business out 
there. 

Ayame&#39;s silver eyes stalked from one side of the corridor to the other. 
It was all clear. With one hand on the hilt of her sword (Nobunaga) she 
rushed forwards straight down the hallway to the other end of it. She 
proceeded to slow down as soon as she came to the doors of the elevator. 
The one that joined the upper lab with the lower one. According to the 
floor plans that she had received from Simon, the lower part of the 
complex was the one most likely to be holding Julia. It was a little 
harder to move around down there because of the tighter security, 
probably an indication of importance. It was a logical assumption to 
suggest that test subjects for the Shougatsu Financial Group&#39;s 
experiments would be there. As Ayame came to the doors of the elevator 
she was confronted with another keypad on the wall. Another security 
measure. The young woman exhaled, pulled out the ID Key and swiped it 
through the slight gap of space left in the keypad for that action. The 
videoscreen on the keypad brightened and projected the words &#39;ACCESS 
APPROVED&#39;. And the white doors of the elevator opened soon afterward. 
Ayame strode into the small lift and leaned up against the wall as the 
doors began closing behind her. She crossed her arms and shut her eyes, 
taking the time to think.

&quot;So far... so good,&quot; She spoke aloud, &quot;Now... I just have to hope that I 
can find Julia before the security teams get wind of my presence. If 
she&#39;s even here. Because the last thing I wanna do is get caught messing 
with the Shougatsu. They might have a pretty face in the public eye but 
I know full well what these people are capable of...&quot;

The lift began the slow process of shifting down the occupant to the 
lower levels of the lab. A good five minutes later, the lowering 
sensation faded and the doors began opening. Ayame opened her expressive 
silver eyes and clutched at the hilt of Nobunaga, looking to see if 
anyone had caught her out yet. No one was there. Ayame ran out into this 
new corridor before the doors closed on her again. Now she was in the 
lower level of the Research Facility. But it was quite a bit different 
from the upper level. That part of the building was obviously there for 
show. In a sense, a kind of mask for the public eye. But the real agony 
of science took place down here. The walls and floors were much like the 
above, but the ceilings were not furnished. They brandished the thick 
rocks of the underground. To each door around was a keypad lock, far 
more here than anywhere else. And the stink of abused chemicals hung 
with disquieting thickness in the air. This was the true side of the 
Bio-Technological Research Laboratory. It was unmistakeable. Though she 
kept one hand on her sword, Ayame sped up her run with less concern this 
time around. Something was telling her to get this over with quickly. 
And the Dark Katana was feeling in no mood to argue with it. She ran 
down the long main corridor of the lower level, darting around the view 
of each of the security cameras and blazing a trail straight down to a 
particular room. Upon it was a signboard. And the written phrase on that 
sign board was;

&#39;Magi-019&#39;.

Normally, Ayame would have just run past such a thing. It didn&#39;t seem to 
matter much. But she stopped herself from moving onwards. She froze, and 
then took a deep look at the door in front of her. Something was 
niggling at her to check this out. Julia or not. Ayame took out the ID 
Key again, and swept it through the keypad lock at the side of the door. 
After being told that her access was approved once more, that automatic 
door began to open up in a slow motion. It was pulled aside to one 
point, revealing the innards of that room. But it wasn&#39;t so much a room 
as it was a cell. Across from the Nakagawa-girl was another young woman. 
Who was probably a year older than the Dark Katana herself. Clad in a 
long white dress, medical-looking, obviously given to her by the 
scientists, the girl had a chilled, quiet look in her deep bright green 
eyes, while her lengthy chocolate brown hair swayed at her sides. 

Ayame blinked. Was this...? &quot;...Are you... Julia McAmish...?&quot;

&quot;Aye...&quot; The brown-haired girl acknowledged it, pushing forth a lighter, 
more feminine version of her Father&#39;s Scottish accent, &quot;...but who are 
you...?&quot;
