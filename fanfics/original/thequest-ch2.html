<a href="../original/thequest-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Snow White asked after nearly two days of travel and 
searching, her heavy traveler&#39;s cloak now partially stained with mud and 
dirt, &quot;she&#39;s been taken by a dragon?&quot; She looked confused as she 
continued, &quot;From the rumors that lead me out here I thought that 
Charming rescued Naomi from it.&quot;

&quot;He did,&quot; the village elder nodded cheerfully, &quot;but he couldn&#39;t actually 
kill it, m&#39;lady.&quot; At her fierce look he continued quickly, &quot;Dragon&#39;s are 
rare beasts, y&#39;know and her Majesty might be a wee bit upset if people 
were slaying them all.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Snow conceded the point, her black hair tied back in a messy 
braid. &quot;So Lady Naomi was out washing clothes down by the river and the 
dragon snatched her, again?&quot; she asked. A pause, &quot;From the exact same 
spot she got taken from?&quot;

&quot;Aye,&quot; a taller young man agreed.

The bar keep arrived with their mugs of dark beer, setting them down 
with a thump. &quot;Suppose she&#39;s unlucky that way,&quot; the heavily muscular man 
rumbled out.

Snow had a fairly annoyed look on her face, &quot;And I guess she was the 
last one to see the Prince?&quot; They nodded seriously and Snow sighed.

&quot;What do you want to do, ma&#39;am?&quot; the little town&#39;s mayor asked her 
seriously, holding onto his hat and turning it nervously in his hands.

She took another drink of the bad beer, visibly shuddering at the taste 
before looking around at the inn they were sitting in glumly. &quot;It looks 
like,&quot; Snow said seriously as she rose tiredly, &quot;I&#39;ll have to rescue 
her, myself.&quot;

Ignoring all of their protests Snow smoothly rose from the table, 
tossing some coins on the table top as she strode outside to see a 
familiar sight. Rosebud stood there by the post with a very self 
satisfied expression in the red stallion&#39;s posture, two young men 
writhing in pain nearby as they weakly clutched at their vitals.

&quot;I warned you to leave him alone,&quot; Snow said pleasantly as she untied 
her horse. Smoothly pulling herself up into the saddle she asked 
crisply, &quot;Is there an armorer in town?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; one of the men Rosebud had taken a disliking to painfully pulled 
himself up as he said, &quot;but our blacksmithy dabbles in it.&quot;

Snow nodded as she nudged her stallion forward, &quot;Good enough.&quot;

Nearly two hours later and the young woman was riding back out of town, 
fully dressed for battle. A helm covered her head, visor raised, and a 
gleaming shirt of chainmail covered her upper body. She awkwardly 
carried a wooden lance, tipped with metal, and along with her short 
sword a longer blade was slung over her back, a triangular shield 
strapped to one arm.

Rosebud puffed out a complaint at the added weight and Snow smiled to 
herself wryly. &quot;It could be worse,&quot; she sighed out as she patted his 
neck, &quot;they could have talked me into wearing the platemail armor that 
smith offered.&quot; With a grim smile she mused, &#39;Not that plate would help 
much. Hampers your movement too much, and against a dragon&#39;s flame or 
claws it wouldn&#39;t do much good.&#39;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; the mayor called out to Snow White as she passed the bar, 
the man now swaying slightly from the drink.

&quot;I&#39;m going to need it,&quot; Snow answered as she left the edge of town and 
headed out into the largely untamed forest beyond.

Following the old main road they traveled for a short while before 
veering off onto a roughly broken in trail. The thick forest that 
circled the town began to gradually disappear even as they eventually 
reached the river, following it up into the hills. The ground grew 
rougher, grass being replaced by dirt and rock, and soon there was a 
faint smell of brimstone hanging in the air.

&quot;We&#39;re getting close,&quot; Snow murmured, her blue eyes warily searching for 
signs of the dragon&#39;s den. Like the wyrms that the beasts were said to 
be related to dragons largely chose to make their homes underground, 
usually settling in naturally formed caverns. &#39;And this looks like 
dragon country,&#39; she thought to herself grimly.

All around them the bare stone had been scorched, even partially melted 
in places, and the surviving brush was withered and unhealthy, with 
sickly brown leaves and twisted branches. Few if any animals lingered 
nearby, only small creatures too little to be of any interest to 
something with a dragon&#39;s appetite. Even the skies were mostly clear, 
the usual sound of bird&#39;s song entirely absent as they went higher into 
the rocky hills.

Something spurred Snow to climb down from her horse, advancing quietly 
as she made her way forward to peer around a large boulder. &quot;Well isn&#39;t 
that interesting,&quot; Snow blinked in surprise as she took in the view that 
awaited her.

Lady Naomi was chained up to the cliff side, the lovely redhead dressed 
in the skimpy rags left of her clothes, rags that did little to hide her 
lush curves. Oddly she didn&#39;t even look very dirty, the dragon 
apparently having taken some pains to take good care of her to feast on 
later. The beast itself was curled up nearby, the red and gold scaled 
creature thick in body with a thin neck and tail along with a slightly 
larger triangular head.

&#39;It must be a younger dragon,&#39; Snow noted as she studied it&#39;s gleaming 
fangs and brow ridges, &#39;only a hundred or so, maybe.&#39; It gave her 
somewhat better odds, really, though she disliked the idea of hurting 
what amounted to a dragon child. &#39;Still,&#39; Snow mused as she quietly 
returned to Rosebud, &#39;it&#39;s not like I have a lot of choice.&#39;

Smoothly Snow climbed into the saddle, grabbing the lance and holding it 
ready pointing forward if a bit high. She took a steadying breath the 
used her heels to nudge Rose bud into motion, another signal pushing him 
to a run. Racing around the corner they saw the dragon rousing itself 
from a nap, looking around before instantly fixing on them.

&#39;There goes surprise,&#39; Snow thought as she lowered the lance to strike.

&quot;Sir Knight,&quot; Naomi cried out happily, her breath nearly popping her 
bosom free from the remains of her blouse.

A few beats of those massive wings began to push the ten foot long 
dragon up into the air, but Snow was prepared for something like that. 
Shouting out a half-remembered battle cry she ripped the lance right 
through the heavy leather wing, breaking the weapon but sending the 
beast crashing back to earth with a roar of pain.

Casting the broken stump of the wooden lance aside Snow swiftly slipped 
her feet free of the stirrups and dismounted onto the rocky ground, 
drawing the heavy sword slung over her shoulder. Almost on cue the 
stallion moved around to the other side of the dragon, facing off 
against the much larger creature with it&#39;s pure bad-temperdness.

&quot;Oh be careful, Sir Knight,&quot; Naomi cried out worriedly, tugging weakly 
at the chains that still bound her to the cliff.

Snow watched the beast warily, especially the tongue that darted out to 
occasionally taste the air. The dragon almost seemed reluctant as it 
swiveled it&#39;s head back and forth between Rosebud and Snow White, trying 
to decide which was the greater threat at the moment.

&#39;Now how did Naomi get tied to the wall in the first place?&#39; Snow found 
herself wondering, &#39;It&#39;s not like the dragon has hands....&#39;

The dragon reared up, great mouth opening as it looked over at Snow 
White then suddenly bleated in pain. Rosebud had just slammed his hooves 
down on the stunned dragon&#39;s tail, hitting it with a sudden burst of 
pain. Wheeling around it went for the horse, sleekly snaking forward 
before it realized it&#39;s fatal error.

Cursing the weight of her armor Snow got on top of the beast, getting 
her sword around to hold the weapon against the dragon&#39;s throat. &quot;I 
figured it out,&quot; Snow said coldly, &quot;finally. Change to your other form, 
now.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;Or I swear that I&#39;ll kill you, now.&quot;

The dragon was still as it weighed it&#39;s options, then the dragon 
shuddered. As Snow jumped down the dragon shrank, pulling in swiftly as 
the wings disappeared, scales lightened and the body reshaped itself. 
The golden haired woman rose stiffly, clutching a bleeding shoulder as 
she coldly asked, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

Snow turned back to the visibly stunned Naomi, walking over to unchain 
the woman. &quot;You couldn&#39;t have locked her up with claws,&quot; she said 
casually, &quot;you must have chained the lady up when she was unconscious.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Naomi managed, looking at Snow in confusion, &quot;you&#39;re... a 
woman?&quot;

Realizing the source of the confusion Snow took her helm off, smiling 
wryly as she said, &quot;Sorry.&quot; She turned to look back at the dragon, the 
almost metallic gold haired woman garbed in a simple red gown, &quot;Why do 
you keep capturing Naomi, anyway, Miss...?&quot;

&quot;I am called Dawn,&quot; the dragon said. She gave a sideways glance at 
Naomi, a faint blush coloring her cheeks as she said, &quot;In truth, it is 
difficult to explain....&quot;

Snow blinked, noting the thoughtful gaze that Naomi was now giving the 
dragon. &#39;I think she won&#39;t need rescuing from Dawn anymore,&#39; she mused. 
Clearing her throat to get their attention she asked, &quot;Naomi, after 
Prince Charming saved you where did he say he was going?&quot;

&quot;Further west,&quot; Naomi answered promptly, &quot;towards the High Queen&#39;s 
lands.&quot;

&quot;Even farther to go,&quot; Snow whimpered. She sighed and bowed, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 
After Snow climbed up on Rosebud and walked away she could still hear 
the two women talking.

&quot;Your poor shoulder,&quot; Naomi exclaimed.

&quot;There is a healing spring nearby,&quot; Dawn reassured her, &quot;I have used it 
before, like when Charming stabbed me.&quot;

&quot;Why have you been taking me captive, anyway?&quot; Naomi asked her softly, 
helping support the other young woman.

&quot;I saw you washing clothes down by the river,&quot; Dawn answered her shyly, 
&quot;and I was entranced by your beauty....&quot;</pre>
