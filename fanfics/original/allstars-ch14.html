7:31 am

 

&quot;That&#39;s not a good enough excuse, Velur, and I&#39;m going to keep poking my 
nose in your affairs until you give me a straight answer. If you won&#39;t 
go out with me because I&#39;m another woman, fine. But grow a backbone and 
say it.&quot; Fausta glared at Felicity, demanding she show the same 
pure-hearted drive and focus she demonstrated on the field- the singular 
quality Fausta sought above all others. She felt like she could really 
love Felicity- not like a flowery romantic, but a fiery, passionate 
force of nature, a destructive love, an explosive love- but only if she 
could stand firm and proud, and speak with certainty and clarity.

&quot;I just don&#39;t have the time,&quot; Felicity answered weakly. &quot;I have to focus 
on my schoolwork and practice.&quot;

&quot;Neither of which you&#39;ll have to worry about until later. I&#39;ve spoken 
with the Coach, and she says our first practice session isn&#39;t until this 
weekend. Besides, we have today and tomorrow all to ourselves. You 
cannot honestly think that- &quot;

&quot;Would you just get off my back?!&quot; she yelled. &quot;I said I don&#39;t want to 
and that&#39;s that! Now leave me alone!&quot;

&quot;Not until I get a good reason. You owe me that much at least. I don&#39;t 
buy any of this &#39;I don&#39;t have enough time&#39; nonsense. Is it a matter of 
dating the same sex?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not the point!&quot;

&quot;Yes or no, Velur?&quot; Felicity froze, suffocating, her voice gone, her 
body ready to crumble. She desperately wanted to come out of her coffin, 
out of the closet- she had admitted it to herself but not to others, not 
to anybody but her- but she couldn&#39;t, she couldn&#39;t, she couldn&#39;t. She 
hated herself so much.

God-damn you, you fucking coward. Just look at yourself! You&#39;re less 
than pathetic.

&quot;Just leave me alone,&quot; she whined. &quot;Leave me the hell alone. I just 
don&#39;t like you, that&#39;s all!&quot;

Even though you&#39;ve been staring at her nonstop since you first met her.

&quot;I&#39;m comfortable with that,&quot; Fausta replied calmly. &quot;I&#39;ve dated women 
that didn&#39;t like me. They came around.&quot;

&quot;Well I won&#39;t. Now leave me alone. I want to be by myself now.&quot; Felicity 
left the locker room with a huff, disheveled after dressing hastily. 
Fausta frowned at her, disappointed at this turn of events. Somehow, she 
just couldn&#39;t believe the older woman. Something was definitely holding 
her back.

&quot;Is that what you really want,&quot; she wondered.

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;The Last Minute&quot;

 

&quot;You see? I told you it would be worth it if we came here early!&quot;

&quot;But the library hasn&#39;t even opened yet.&quot;

&quot;That just means we&#39;ll be the first ones inside!&quot;

&quot;Actually, I think the librarian would be the first one in.&quot;

&quot;Semantics! It&#39;s only a fifteen minute wait. That&#39;s nothing compared to 
the time we might&#39;ve spent if we came here later.&quot;

&quot;I know, I saw the lines. I still can&#39;t believe the campus bookstore has 
to back order textbooks.&quot;

&quot;You know what the true irony here is, right? We&#39;re here waiting.&quot;

&quot;Well, we are ordinary students, but I know what you mean. Oh, look- I 
think that&#39;s her. She works here; I saw her here on Friday!&quot;

&quot;Ah, excellent! You came just in time!&quot; Elisa Berkeley had been 
strolling down the sidewalk in the early morning, just enjoying the nice 
weather after the rain. She didn&#39;t expect to be pulled away from her 
daydreams and back into reality so suddenly, but when she saw there were 
people actually waiting for her to open the library, she sighed- so much 
for fantasies- dug out her keys, and began her daily duties.

&quot;Just give me a few minutes,&quot; she requested. Her first two customers- an 
attractive young man and woman, both with sheer black hair: one short 
and spiky, the other long and wavy- were kind enough to stand back and 
give her some room, but once the door was open and Elisa had erected the 
sign, they burst through and made a beeline for the Student Textbooks 
bin.

&quot;Is there anything I can help you two with?&quot;

&quot;No thanks,&quot; said the man.

&quot;We&#39;ve got it covered,&quot; the woman said. They chattered to themselves as 
they assembled their texts; several other people came through the doors 
as Elisa was organizing her desk, and fanned out to explore and 
research. One of them, a tomboyish woman with short blonde hair and a 
slight figure, stood at the desk with her hands on her hips. It was 
difficult to discern her gender at first; she could almost pass for a 
man.

&quot;Mary! Jerry! Haven&#39;t you found them yet?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your hurry, Jillikins? Classes won&#39;t start for two days!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s so cute when she&#39;s impatient.&quot;

&quot;And lucky for us, Mr. Nails is always like that.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t bother me with that anymore,&quot; Jill stated dully, &quot;so you may 
as well stop.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a term of affection!&quot; Mary exclaimed.

&quot;A high honor between three friends,&quot; Jerry added. They smiled and 
nodded at each other.

&quot;I&#39;ll settle for a handshake,&quot; she grumbled. She turned to Elisa and 
smiled weakly. &quot;Um, old friends of mine. What do you have in college 
algebra?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, well, everything&#39;s been organized in those bins over there by 
subject.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay. Is that what&#39;s taking you two so long? Are you digging around 
for my books too?&quot;

&quot;Of course. We got here early just so we could claim all the leftovers.&quot;

&quot;And if we can&#39;t find your books, Jillers, you&#39;ll be out of luck.&quot;

&quot;So you can be generous, occasionally,&quot; she snickered. Mary and Jerry, 
evidently twins from the way they looked and acted, returned to Elisa&#39;s 
desk with an armful of textbooks each. This was just a preview of the 
squalling in store for her: ever since the main campus bookstore ran out 
of several texts, more and more students were relying on the library to 
supply their study material. This meant that Elisa would probably be ran 
ragged until Saturday, what with all the purchases and returns. To make 
things worse, her coworkers had all moved away, gone on to other jobs, 
or shifted their schedules around the &quot;busy season&quot;, leaving her to 
weather everything alone. Alas, the &quot;help desperately wanted&quot; sign she 
put up had been ignored ever since.

&quot;I hope mother doesn&#39;t throw a fit when she realizes we&#39;re paying for 
Jill&#39;s books as well,&quot; Mary said.

&quot;Knowing her, she&#39;ll probably give us medals for generosity!&quot; Jerry 
exclaimed. The twins gave Elisa a shockingly prestigious credit card, 
and she rang up all three orders without saying a word. Even now, with 
her curiosity piqued, she knew better than to interfere.

&quot;So what kind of help do you need?&quot; said Jill, tapping the sign. Elisa 
suddenly felt like hugging the woman just for asking.

&quot;Oh, thank goodness! Please tell me you&#39;re interested in a job! It&#39;s for 
the register during the semester. I need at least two more people up 
here and someone to organize everything and keep inventory.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re two people!&quot; Mary exclaimed.

&quot;And we don&#39;t have jobs,&quot; Jerry added happily.

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to work in a real library.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m sure I can squeeze in some time between studies and practice.&quot;

&quot;I thought I recognized you from somewhere!&quot; Elisa exclaimed. &quot;You&#39;re on 
the men&#39;s soccer team!&quot;

&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right. I&#39;m Jerry Belfiske.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m his cute older sister Mary.&quot; They both glanced at their 
accomplice, who had been skimming through her texts. They ribbed her and 
she jumped to attention.

&quot;Uh, right! I&#39;m Jill Haynes, their...uh, friend. So can we get 
applications?&quot;

&quot;Applications?&quot; Elisa whispered, breathless with excitement. &quot;Ha! You 
don&#39;t need any stinking applications! You&#39;re hired!!&quot;

 

- Valencia Durante, 21, 5&#39;7&quot; (1.7 m), goalie-

 

As excited as they were about working at the library, Mary and Jerry 
(and Jill) still needed time to put their books away and grab some 
breakfast. Elisa assured them that the real rush would not begin until 
sometime after lunch, so they could take their time and not feel 
pressured. She nearly fell over when they volunteered to start working 
that very day, and if she were any less of a lady, she would&#39;ve kissed 
them all for their charity.

The first few waves of last-minute customers and early clusters of study 
buddies were sufficient to keep Elisa busy until her new coworkers 
returned- busy, but not hectic. That would come later! She kept at a 
steady pace for an hour, and even managed to throw around a bit of 
cheer. Normally she didn&#39;t pay attention to her customers and patrons- 
they were all just faces that blended into the background- but she 
clearly recognized a few of them as they came through her doors, 
chatting and laughing obnoxiously. They were her teammates, but...oh, 
drat, she forgot their names. Well, the one with the Russian accent was 
Nadia, and the one wearing punk rocker clothes was Lauren- that was easy 
enough. Who could ever forget them? But the other two...

&quot;Hey there!&quot; Lauren exclaimed as she leaned on the reception desk. 
&quot;You&#39;re that badass chick from before, right? The babe with the hot 
British accent! I&#39;m Lauren.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she said, her breath caught in her throat as they shook 
hands. &quot;May I help you ladies?&quot;

&quot;Sure. Y&#39;wanna go out sometime?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?!&quot;

&quot;Ignore her. We&#39;re looking for advanced psychology and sociology books, 
please,&quot; said a serious-looking brunette with blue and green eyes. Elisa 
let out a breath and scurried to look for them. Lauren watched her and 
grinned as she bent down to peruse the lower shelves.

&quot;Mmm, nice.&quot;

&quot;Why must you make such a perverted fool of yourself?&quot; sighed her 
companion. Elisa pretended not to hear and came back with their orders.

&quot;I must apologize, but I still don&#39;t know most of your names,&quot; she said.

&quot;Iz okay, our acquaintance iz not being made everywhere,&quot; Nadia said. 
She grinned at Elisa, causing her to blush, as they exchanged names, and 
she also learned that Valencia, Jen, and Arina- Lauren&#39;s somber friend 
and rival- were with them.

&quot;We met each other by chance on the way to the library,&quot; Arina murmured. 
&quot;It&#39;s sort of like an abridged version of The Canterbury Tales.&quot;

&quot;I could go for some Canterbury Easter eggs right about now,&quot; Lauren 
sighed.

&quot;That&#39;s Cadbury, Lauren. Thank you, Elisa.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?&quot;

&quot;Just resist her charms,&quot; she answered kindly. Lauren snorted as her 
friend walked away, scooped her books up, winked, and trudged outside.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Jen wondered. &quot;Anyway, Leese, Val&#39;s asked me out 
on a date tomorrow, and we&#39;ve decided to hit that nightclub. Wanna come 
with? We can double up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure what you mean,&quot; she replied carefully. Elisa never 
considered herself very savvy on current events and popular places, but 
she was hardly out of touch.

&quot;The Out and About club,&quot; Jen pointed. She chuckled and said, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, you don&#39;t have to be gay to get in.&quot;

&quot;Oh, encouraging.&quot;

&quot;Look, just do this as a favor. Come and hang out with us. We are on the 
same team, and besides, Nadia won&#39;t have a date.&quot;

&quot;I promise we will have all the sexy fun you can take,&quot; she said.

&quot;And once school&#39;s out, we can head on over to Parody for game night! 
But I gotta warn you all: I&#39;m no pushover. Don&#39;t give me an excuse to 
PWN you.&quot;

&quot;PWN?&quot;

&quot;Defeat us utterly,&quot; Valencia answered. She laughed at Elisa&#39;s 
confusion. &quot;I know, it&#39;s really dorky, but I figured I could at least 
try it out. Jen&#39;s going dancing with me, so it&#39;s only fair.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m not taking my shirt off,&quot; she stated defensively.

&quot;I am!&quot; Nadia chirped. Elisa looked even more baffled.

&quot;Why would you...&quot;

&quot;Lordy, woman, time to get out from underneath that rock! Tuesday is 
Topless day at the O and A. It&#39;s normally not my thing, but since Val 
was kind enough to attend game night with me...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what makes dates so fun,&quot; she said warmly. &quot;You get to 
experience things you never would&#39;ve considered...providing you have an 
open mind and like to be adventurous. So how many dates have you been 
on, Elisa?&quot;

&quot;Oh, not enough to brag about,&quot; she replied humbly.

&quot;Have you ever been dating woman before?&quot; Nadia asked.

&quot;Um, not really...but you know, I really have no objection to it- I just 
haven&#39;t, well...you know. But I&#39;ll more than likely be busy those days. 
Oh! No, wait- I almost forgot! I just recently hired some help. I 
suppose that if you&#39;re okay with it, I could just take some time off.&quot;

&quot;More than okay!&quot; Nadia exclaimed. &quot;You should be taking entire day off! 
Pretty Eleeza needz holiday! You will being good date for next two 
dayz!&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; she chuckled feebly. &quot;But...ah...don&#39;t expect me to be very 
frivolous about it. And I&#39;m certainly not taking my...my top off. And 
I&#39;m not very interested in video games, except for a few online ones.&quot;

&quot;Just tagging along will be good enough,&quot; Jen said. Elisa agreed that it 
would, and promised she would be there. She processed their orders and 
prepared to say goodbye when her new coworkers came back. They greeted 
Nadia, Valencia, and Jen, and shimmied behind the reception desk, ready 
to begin their first day.

&quot;We got you something too,&quot; Jerry said as he offered her a sack. &quot;I hope 
you&#39;re okay with pancakes.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t have to do that! But thank you! I am rather famished. Do you 
think I could ask you three for a favor?&quot;

&quot;Sure, anything. We do owe you for giving us this job.&quot;

&quot;No, I owe you,&quot; she replied sweetly. &quot;But I was wondering if I could 
have...what days?&quot;

&quot;Tuesday and Wednesday,&quot; Valencia said.

&quot;If you would cover for me while I take those days off.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so is that why you hired us?&quot; Mary grinned wickedly.

&quot;The boss gets some extra help so she can skip work, is that it?&quot; Jerry 
snickered. Jill rolled her eyes.

&quot;Oh shut up, you two, she probably deserves it. Think about what time of 
year it is. You go ahead and take some time off, boss. We can probably 
work Thursday and Friday if you need a vacation.&quot; Elisa grinned warmly 
at Jill.

&quot;Thank you, but no: I&#39;ll be fine. I suppose everything has been settled, 
then?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, definitely!&quot; Jen exclaimed. &quot;Um, pardon me for a moment, but what 
are your all&#39;s names? I get the feeling we&#39;ve met before.&quot; When the trio 
introduced themselves, Jen&#39;s eyes bulged and she squealed ecstatically. 
&quot;Ohmygod, are you serious? Hahaha, no wonder I thought I recognized you 
guys! We&#39;re in the same bandit guild together! I&#39;m your leader, 
Sarishaun!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the bandit princess?&quot; Jill scoffed. &quot;Bullshit!&quot; Jen laughed and 
hugged them; apparently, they were online friends of hers.

&quot;Cool, I can&#39;t believe you&#39;re students here as well! Huynh the centaur&#39;s 
here too- I&#39;ll introduce you on Wednesday! Wow, it&#39;s like we were 
brought together by a higher power or something!&quot;

&quot;Coincidence,&quot; Jill grumbled. Elisa, Nadia, and Valencia were lost, of 
course, so Jen introduced them.

&quot;They&#39;re online friends of mine. Jill is my second in command, and these 
two are my underlings! So this is what Mr. Nails looks like- and I never 
thought Merod and Gerod were brother and sister. It all makes sense 
somehow.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re as bewildered as I was when I first learned,&quot; Jill sighed 
dramatically. Nadia and Valencia coughed, indicating that they wanted to 
leave.

&quot;We&#39;ll just step out so that you video game dorks can talk.&quot;

&quot;Yes, must not spend all day in library. Will have much time to see them 
later. Must be, how you say, getting back on track.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Jen groaned. &quot;But hey, you all should come with us to 
the nightclub and game night! Uh...sorry, Gerod- I mean, Jerry- but guys 
aren&#39;t allowed to O and A. Nothing personal.&quot;

&quot;Aw, nuts.&quot; He waved at the ladies as they departed, making sure that 
Elisa understood the particulars about their outing. Once the fresh air 
wrapped itself around them, Nadia started jogging to the Lily Club, 
leaving Valencia to stare at her new girlfriend.

&quot;Bandit princess, huh?&quot;

 

- Fleur Lacroix, 20, 5&#39;10&quot; (1.77 m), right midfielder-

 

&quot;I still can&#39;t comprehend why you decided to buy your books at the last 
minute. You do not even have an excuse. I at least enrolled later due to 
some unforeseen circumstances.&quot;

&quot;And you blame me for making excuses! Thanks.&quot; Lauren threw down another 
of her friend&#39;s bags, feeling exhausted, and laid down on the skewed 
couch so she could catch her breath. &quot;I didn&#39;t wait until the last 
minute, okay? It&#39;s still Monday, remember? Besides, we beat the rush, 
and we got our books, right?&quot;

&quot;Procrastination will never help you,&quot; Arina said pretentiously.

&quot;Ah, lay off,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I was too busy with my life to be bothered 
by some shitty schoolbook. Not all of us can be neurotic bitches.&quot;

&quot;Yes, apparently some of us are busy being lazy.&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t like taking things too seriously. Here&#39;s another bag.&quot;

&quot;Just put it anywhere.&quot; Arina&#39;s apartment was amazingly cluttered, even 
for somebody that was in the process of moving in. Lauren had 
volunteered to help her get settled; she knew how rough it was, 
transferring from the familiar into a strange new place. You didn&#39;t know 
your way around, or where anything was, and there seemed to be an 
unlimited supply of baggage to be carried and stuffed and broken and 
scratched and bumped around. But it was a necessary development: Arina&#39;s 
parents had moved out of their old house, leaving her no choice but to 
find another place, preferably a little closer to school. The first 
thing she set up was her cell phone and charger, placing them atop a 
small desk she and Lauren had brought in.

&quot;Man, why&#39;d you have to get a place on the third floor?&quot; Lauren 
grumbled.

&quot;It was the only one available at such short notice, and with my budget, 
it was really the only one I could afford. You can be bothered to 
perspire a little.&quot;

&quot;But my aching muscles,&quot; she groaned, lifting her shaking arms. &quot;And 
this isn&#39;t even the last of it. I need a shower and a drink.&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; she insisted. &quot;It&#39;ll save me from listening to your 
complaining, and there&#39;s only small items left.&quot;

&quot;Really? Thanks a bunch!&quot; She grinned and scurried off to Arina&#39;s new 
bathroom, peeling off her clothes as she went and throwing them on the 
floor. After all, what did Arina care? Her place was messy enough as it 
was! Arina sighed quietly and called out to Lauren before the rush of 
water drowned her voice out.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget, you&#39;re buying me a housewarming supper!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, kay!&quot; Her phone rang as Arina was throwing Lauren&#39;s sweat-soaked 
clothes in the laundry hamper: it was the Coach.

&quot;How may I help you?&quot;

&quot;Hey Arina, are you available tomorrow at noon? I&#39;m calling an emergency 
team meeting.&quot;

&quot;I just started moving in, but I&#39;ll make the proper arrangements. I&#39;ll 
tell Lauren about it as well; she&#39;s in the shower.&quot;

&quot;Okay, good. Say, do you have any of the other girls&#39; numbers?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m afraid not. Would you mind telling me what this meeting is 
about? You sound concerned.&quot;

&quot;I have every right to be,&quot; Leena stated. &quot;Arina, I don&#39;t like keeping 
people in suspense, but since I don&#39;t have all the details yet, I&#39;m 
afraid you&#39;re going to have to wait. Just be sure to be at the field 
tomorrow by noon.&quot;

&quot;All right, I understand. I&#39;ll be sure to tell Lauren as well.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Arina hung up and poked her head in the bathroom, where she 
saw her friend&#39;s silhouette behind the curtain. &quot;Lauren? Lauren!&quot; A 
sopping mat of dark red hair, strewn around a dripping face, popped out 
from the curtain and stared.

&quot;What? I&#39;m busy.&quot;

&quot;The Coach was on the phone,&quot; Arina pointed. &quot;There&#39;s a meeting tomorrow 
at noon.&quot;

&quot;Um, okay, what about? Practice isn&#39;t until this weekend.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure. She said she&#39;ll tell us later. You will make an attempt 
to be there, won&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, I&#39;ll be there! Jeebus, get off my case. Um, is there anything 
else?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then what are you doing here staring?&quot; she grumbled, waving Arina away. 
&quot;Go, go! This ain&#39;t a peep show!&quot; Arina made for the door, but she 
stopped to primp for a minute first. Eww- now she needed a shower. But 
there were still items to haul in, and it would be better to wash up 
once all the heavy work was done. After putting as many small items in 
her arms as she could, trudging up two flights of stairs, and placing 
them in a disorganized pile, she was just as tired as Lauren, who 
emerged from the bathroom wearing only a towel.

&quot;Crap,&quot; she muttered, &quot;I didn&#39;t bring a change of clothes.&quot; Arina smiled 
at her mysteriously.

&quot;Now what kind of a friend would I be if I never had any spares? 
Besides, we&#39;ve known each other how long? Just leaf through that bag 
over there. I&#39;ll be in the shower soon.&quot;

&quot;We should&#39;ve taken one together,&quot; Lauren snickered as she searched for 
something to wear. Arina only seemed to have T-shirts and jeans; 
however, they were exactly what Lauren needed, and most of them fit 
well. &quot;Hey,&quot; she called, &quot;I&#39;m heading out for your supper. Y&#39;want 
anything in particular?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your money, but I&#39;d like some pasta from Pizza Hut.&quot;

&quot;Cool, I&#39;ll go call it in. And hey, Essylt, welcome to the new pad.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so sweet,&quot; she chirped sarcastically as she shut the bathroom 
door.

 

- Rain Howlet, 19, 6&#39;0&quot; (1.82 m), no position-

 

&quot;It isn&#39;t that I don&#39;t have faith in your abilities or theirs, but since 
it was the Chairman&#39;s idea, you can bet he&#39;ll try to tip the scales in 
his favor. ...I&#39;ll do all that I can to find a team that can play on 
their level, but I won&#39;t make any guarantees. ...Yes, I&#39;ll be sure to 
call you again once I verify who your opponents will be. You&#39;ll be the 
first to know. ...You&#39;re welcome. The rest is in your hands, Leena. ...I 
will. You take care too.&quot;

Rosewood hung up and rubbed her temples- not out of frustration or 
anxiety, but because she simply needed to relax and put herself in a 
state of mind where she&#39;d be prepared for the new semester. Fitzgerald&#39;s 
challenge didn&#39;t come as a surprise at all: even if he hadn&#39;t been a 
sneaky, conniving, ruthless serpent, Rosewood would have just suggested 
it herself. She knew the best way to test the abilities of the teams was 
to let them practice against other players, ands the ultimatum, while 
concerning, certainly gave everyone an incentive to perform better.

Just as she was getting up to brew a hot kettle of tea, she heard 
someone coming through the front door- three people, actually, judging 
from the overall noise- and picked out extra cups for them. While she 
was busying herself, a young man and two young women came into the den, 
looking exhausted but satisfied. They took their shoes off and padded 
around, making themselves comfortable.

&quot;Mi casa es su casa, senor Nails!&quot; the girl chirped.

&quot;Thanks. Hey, somebody&#39;s brewing tea. Did you guys leave a kettle on?&quot;

&quot;No, we don&#39;t have a kettle. Mother must&#39;ve dropped by for a visit.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s unusual,&quot; the man said. Rosewood appeared before they could call 
out, and grinned warmly. She had four cups of tea on a tray and several 
snacks.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind my intrusion, but you did say 
I could come visit whenever I liked, and you did give me a copy of your 
key.&quot;

&quot;Guilty as charged,&quot; the man said. He took the trays from her and kissed 
her cheek dutifully. &quot;So what&#39;s the occasion today?&quot; Rosewood shrugged.

&quot;I just wanted to visit. Actually, I do have a bit of news to tell you 
two. Will you be staying long, Miss Haynes?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, the night. They said it was fine.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s their apartment,&quot; she answered. &quot;Anyway, about that bit of news: 
the Chairman has decided to push the practice schedule up by a few 
weeks. Jerry, you probably already heard this from Bracton, but you&#39;ll 
be going up against three teams late in this month, and if you lose two 
of those games, I&#39;m afraid the team will be disbanded and the program 
canceled.&quot;

&quot;Evil Lord Gary strikes again,&quot; the girl lamented. &quot;Just for once, I 
wish he was like the Gaios Gary.&quot;

&quot;I have to agree with the Chairman this time,&quot; Rosewood said carefully. 
&quot;You need some real experience. Do you think you&#39;ll do well?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got a good team, so we might just win all three games. Still, 
I&#39;ll try to practice as much as I can.&quot;

&quot;Good. You know that I&#39;m proud of you even if the team fails.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. But lucky Mary, not having all that pressure.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m the one Elisa chose as her right-hand woman! I&#39;ve got textbook 
mania to cover!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s all this about?&quot; Rosewood said, shaking her head.

&quot;We finally got a job,&quot; Jerry announced.

&quot;We&#39;re working at the school library,&quot; Mary added. They beamed at Jill, 
who was apparently meant to conclude their thought.

&quot;Oh, um, right! Elisa&#39;s our coworker, and she&#39;s on the women&#39;s team.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see. I believe Leena&#39;s going to inform her tomorrow, but if she 
misses it somehow, can I count on you two to fill her in?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll ask her about it at work.&quot; Nudge.

&quot;Oh! Um, right. Yeah, we&#39;re not going to miss it.&quot;

&quot;Good. Ah, there it goes. Let me get the kettle and I&#39;ll serve the tea. 
It&#39;s the least I can do after barging in.&quot; Rosewood left with a smirk; 
Jill plopped down on a couch as Mary and Jerry joined her.

&quot;It&#39;s still hard to believe the retired General Rosewood is your 
mother,&quot; she commented.

&quot;That&#39;s not so difficult to believe,&quot; Mary said. &quot;The kicker is that 
they found someone who can stand up to her!&quot;

&quot;The Chairman, you mean? Sheesh, where&#39;d they get him, anyway?&quot;

&quot;From somewhere in Europe, I heard,&quot; Jerry said. &quot;Helmuth is a German 
name, but I believe Fitzgerald is Scottish.&quot;

&quot;Well, he certainly lives up to his nickname,&quot; Jill scoffed. Meanwhile, 
in the kitchen, Stacie Rosewood smiled to herself as she poured the tea. 
Ever since her husband passed away several years back, Mary and Jerry 
had become even more precious to her, yet she had been gone from her 
children for so long thanks to her career in the military; she regretted 
missing so many vital years of their life.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;now&#39;s the perfect time for me to make it 
up to them.&quot;
