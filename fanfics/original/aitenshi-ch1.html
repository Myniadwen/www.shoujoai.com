<h1>Ai no Tenchi!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hnakamura.html">Hikari Nakamura</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes:

hehehe!! this is my first attempt at writing a fic since primary 
school, so pls excuse if it&#39;s poor :P anyway, just a few things...

first, this is supposed to be like an anime, but my fanart is so poor 
that it wouldn&#39;t do it justice for me to put in any drawings... no 
doubt comparisons will be made to card captor sakura shoujo ai fanfics 
(which has already happened...), which i&#39;ll explain by saying &#39;i love 
ccs fanfics!&#39; and no doubt they&#39;ve influenced me... also, i swear i 
named by character before i knew sakura&#39;s name was kinomoto. swear!! 
but sakura is a totally cool and cute name, and i actually copied it 
from sakura wars&#39; sakura...

ooh, before i forget... they main characters have japanese names, but 
the setting is not meant to be japanese, and i haven&#39;t included any 
japanese dialogue. sorta inspired by the dub of zoids shinseiki/0, 
which this&#39;ll eventually become a fanfic of...

also, the characters are girls, but i&#39;m a boy, so if some 
dialogue/actions/thoughts etc are completely unbelievable, pls excuse 
me, and possibly provide feedback! any feedback would be greatly 
appreciated!

can&#39;t think of anything else to add... pls enjoy!!

	&quot;Good morning class!&quot;
	&quot;Good morning, Miss Spencer.&quot;
	Miss Spencer&#39;s 6th grade class rose in unison as their teacher 
entered the room. The young but motherly looking Miss Spencer had 
always been well liked and respected by her pupils.
	&quot;I&#39;d like to introduce someone special this morning, she&#39;s our 
new classmate...&quot;
	Miss Spencer extended an open hand toward the doorway, and the 
children&#39;s eyes followed. With great hesitance, in stepped a young 
girl. She had lovely sky blue hair down to her shoulder blades and 
matching baby blue eyes. She was blushing visibly with embarrassment 
with the gaze of a room full of strangers centred on her, but still 
managed a slight bow.
	At the back of the class, Hikari Nakamura almost audibly gasped. 
This newcomer was the most beautiful girl she had ever seen. Not that 
Hikari was by any means an ugly duckling. The cuteness of her emerald 
green hair braided into pigtails was matched only by her mischievous 
azure eyes. As hard as it was to comprehend, she could almost feel 
that the new girl in the class would take up a special place in her 
life.
	&quot;... Let&#39;s all give a warm welcome to Sakura Miyamoto!&quot;
	Miss Spencer&#39;s sweet voice brought Hikari back to earth. The 
tension in the class eased with the sound of polite applause.
	&quot;Would you like to say something Sakura?&quot;
	&quot;... Hi ... Um, it&#39;s nice to meet you all...&quot;
	Sakura&#39;s voice sounded like bells from heaven to Hikari&#39;s ears. 
She could see through her nervousness that Sakura was a humble and 
caring girl, one who would make a most loyal friend...
	&quot;Sakura&#39;s family is new to Dawn Dew Village, so I&#39;d like you all 
to try and make Sakura and her family feel welcome here. Sakura, if 
you&#39;d like to have a seat now?&quot;
	&quot;Yes Miss Spencer. Thank you.&quot;
	Sakura bowed to the teacher and again to the class, before 
moving to the seat Miss Spencer was indicating to. The seat next to 
Hikari.
	Hikari couldn&#39;t take her eyes off her new classmate as she 
settled into her seat and unpacked her materials for class. When she 
was ready, Sakura noticed Hikari&#39;s stare and turned to face her. She 
smiled shyly and gave a quick nod.
	Hikari&#39;s face started to burn red.
	&#39;What&#39;s this tingly feeling inside me?? Why do I get these weird 
feelings aroung the new girl?&#39;
	Hikari managed to regain her composure and smiled her most 
charming smile. Despite already being one of the most popular girls in 
school, she was determined to make Sakura her newest friend.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	&quot;Hi Kari!!&quot;
	Sakura ran up to hug her best friend. It had been three years 
since they first met, and since then, had become closer than two girls 
could ever be. Sakura often thought of the effort that Hikari had put 
in to make her feel like this was her hometown, and how she had spent 
so much of her time with her even though she already had a host of 
friends .
	Hikari hugged Sakura close. The girl who was once the new kid in 
school had turned out to be everything Hikari had hoped. She was her 
best, most trusted, most caring and most loving friend. Sakura helped 
fill part of the emptiness in Hikari&#39;s life, being the only child in a 
family without a father, as he had passed away before Hikari was born. 
To Hikari, Sakura was almost... a sister, but then not...
	Hikari developed a crush on Sakura before they even met, but 
now, it was becoming something different. She didn&#39;t just love being 
with Sakura, or just see her as a beautiful girl, now she was getting 
attracted to her.
	&quot;What&#39;s our first class today, Kura?&quot;
	It was the start of a new semester, and Hikari was still getting 
used to her timetable.
	&quot;We&#39;ve got maths.&quot;
	&quot;Oh! I forgot to do the homework!&quot;
	&quot;Kari&quot;, Sakura chided in a motherly tone, &quot;Didn&#39;t you say you 
were going to do that yesterday afternoon?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah&quot;, admitted Hikari sheepishly. &quot;But I got distracted...&quot;
	&#39;Dreaming about being with you...&#39;, she didn&#39;t add.
	Sakura frowned mock disapprovingly, before taking her friend&#39;s 
hand, &quot;Come on, we&#39;re a little late.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hikari headed to her locker after her last class. After packing 
away the books she didn&#39;t need for homework, she headed to the hall 
entrance.
	&quot;Hey Hikari!&quot;
	Hikari turned, shook out of the half-daze she seemed to be in 
all too often.
	It was Jamie, one of her best male friends. He was leaning 
forward in a bow of sorts, and had a slight blush on his youthful 
face.
	&quot;Hey, what&#39;s up Jamie?&quot;
	&quot;Um... I was, um, thinking of the dance next week, and I, um, 
was wondering if you were going with anyone?&quot;
	Hikari blushed and tried desparately of something to say that 
wasn&#39;t completely daft. She had of course thought she was going to go 
with Sakura, but now that she had to seriously think about it, that 
perhaps wasn&#39;t such a good idea.
	&quot;Um, if you&#39;ve already got a partner that&#39;s fine...&quot;
	Jamie&#39;s face went a darker shade of red, and his clear brown 
eyes lost some of the hope they were filled with a minute earlier.
	&quot;Oh no, I haven&#39;t got anyone to go with! I, ah, I just hadn&#39;t 
really thought about it yet! Um, yeah, I&#39;d love to go with you Jamie.&quot;
	&quot;Really?! Um, that&#39;s great! I guess I&#39;ll see you on Monday then. 
Have a nice weekend!&quot;
	&quot;You too!&quot;, Hikari waved and smiled as a rather relieved Jamie 
ran out the door.
	&#39;Well, I guess I&#39;m not going to be going with Sakura...&#39;, Hikari 
lamented.
	As she left the school, she saw Sakura waiting by the gate, as 
usual. She seemed rather interested at something down the street.
	&quot;Well, Jamie is certainly pretty happy about something&quot;, she 
said as Hikari walked up.
	&quot;Yeah, he was beaming after I said I&#39;d got to the dance with 
him.&quot;
	&quot;Really? So do you like him then?&quot;, Sakura teased as she gave 
Hikari a slight nudge to the ribs.
	Her friend blushed profusely, &quot;Well, yes... but not like that!&quot;
	Sakura had a quiet little giggle to herself. As embarrassed as 
she was, Hikari couldn&#39;t help but smile at seeing her friend in such a 
jovial mood.
	&quot;Hey! It&#39;s not like I&#39;m in love with him or anything!!&quot;
	Sakura regained her composure, and put on a straight face. &quot;I 
think Jamie is cute. He&#39;s genuine about the way he feels about people, 
unlike some of the other guys at school.&quot;
	Hikari felt a tad guilty as Sakura said that, but quickly got 
over it.
	&quot;Hey Sakura? Do you want to stay over at my place tonight? We 
can watch some videos or something.&quot;
	&quot;Okay. Let me call my parents first.&quot;
	Hikari walked on with a contented smile as her friend beside got 
her phone from her shoulder bag.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hikari let out an overexaggerated sigh as she opened the front 
door of her home, and heaved her bag inside.
	&quot;Hi mum! We&#39;re home!&quot;
	&quot;We&#39;re home? Oh, hello Sakura. I should have known you&#39;d be with 
Hikari.&quot;
	Hikari&#39;s mother, Minako, welcomed the two girls with a warm 
smile. She was always congenial, but there her eyes always had a 
twinge of sadness, after the loss of her husband.
	&quot;Hi Aunty Mina&quot;, Sakura greeted her friend&#39;s mother with a 
familiar bow.
	&quot;How many times do I have to tell you, Sakura? You needn&#39;t be so 
formal around here. You should learn some manners from her, Hikari.&quot;
	Sakura giggled while Hikari gave her mother a &#39;don&#39;t embarrass 
me mum&#39; glance.
	&quot;Sorry&quot;, Minako said mockingly, &quot;Would you girls like a drink or 
something to eat?&quot;
	&quot;Yes mum, I&#39;m starving!&quot; All three walked into the kitchen, and 
the two girls took seats as Minako went to the fridge.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	After dinner that evening, Hikari and Sakura went upstairs to 
Hikari&#39;s bedroom.
	&quot;Did you want to watch a movie or something, Sakura?&quot;
	Sakura nodded and proceeded to pick out a video from Hikari&#39;s 
collection. The two girls ended up watching a soppy romance about a 
girl who was unlucky in love, but eventually fell in love with a sweet 
guy who was her best friend, and had been by her side throughout the 
story.
	By the end, Sakura had gone all watery-eyed. &quot;That&#39;s so sweet... 
falling in love with your best friend... that&#39;s so romantic...&quot;, she 
blubbered between sniffles. &quot;Do you think I&#39;ll be that lucky Kari?&quot;
	Hikari was immediately taken aback, having been in her own 
romantic fantasy for the last hour or so.
	&quot;Um... sure Kura, sometimes you never know how much your friends 
really love you...&quot;
	Sakura gave Hikari an innocent hug, which left her blushing. She 
felt a great desire to tell Sakura how she felt, but was so scared at 
how she might react. With her friend close to her like this, 
everything felt so right. Hikari&#39;s fingertips found their way into 
Sakura&#39;s delicate hair...
	&quot;Oh, look at the time! Do you think we better go to bed soon?&quot; 
Sakura gently freed herself from Hikari&#39;s arms and got up.
	&quot;Um, okay. I suppose you don&#39;t have anything to change into, 
huh?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, is it okay if I borrow something to wear tonight?&quot;
	&quot;Sure&quot;, Hikari opened up her wardrobe to see what she could lend 
to Sakura, &quot;What have we got in here?&quot;
	Hikari pulled out a cute nightshirt with an angel and lots of 
hearts on the front.
	&quot;How&#39;s this?&quot;
	&quot;Anything&#39;s fine, Kari. If you&#39;ll excuse me...&quot;, said Sakura as 
she made her way to the adjoining bathroom to bathe and change.
	Sakura emerged from the bathroom a short time later looking warm 
and refreshed. Her normally sky blue hair had taken a darker hue as it 
was still damp from bathing.
	&#39;She looks so lovely...&#39;
	Hikari&#39;s eyes glazed over as she stared at Sakura. Sakura looked 
back with a quizzical expression.
	&quot;Are you okay Kari?&quot;
	&quot;Mmmm... Hmmm... Oh? What? Oh, I better get my clothes, they&#39;re 
somewhere here...&quot;, Kari buried her head in her wardrobe to hide her 
blushes.
	When Hikari had finished showering, she found Sakura sitting 
patiently on her bed. She sat down beside her, leaning slightly 
against her shoulder.
	&quot;Kari. Your hair&#39;s all wet.&quot;
	Sakura buried her fingers in Hikari&#39;s hair and combed it gently, 
as if to illustrate her point. Small droplets of water ran down her 
fingers as she did so. Hikari lent back into Sakura and closed her 
eyes, savouring the pleasant caress of her friend&#39;s soft hands. It 
felt so nice!
	&quot;Kari, are you going to dry your hair?&quot;
	&quot;Oh, can&#39;t you just keep doing that? I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll get the 
water out.&quot;
	&quot;Stop being silly&quot;, Sakura teased, &quot;Your bed is getting wet 
too.&quot;
	&quot;Fine&quot;, Hikari conceded as she headed back to the bathroom.
	When Hikari had finished drying her hair and returned to the 
bedroom, she found Sakura already in bed, curled in a foetal position 
and sucking on her thumb. Both girls often shared a bed, as Hikari 
didn&#39;t like to make Sakura sleep on a bedroll on the floor, and her 
bed was large enough for two anyway.
	Hikari carefully lifted the covers and slid into bed, edging 
herself closer to Sakura. She had fantasised so often of what this 
might otherwise mean. Hikari bit her lip softly as she plucked up her 
courage and extended her hand, resting it lightly on Sakura&#39;s hip. 
Sakura stirred and moaned quietly, making a slight gurgling sound with 
her thumb still in her mouth. Hikari&#39;s resolve shattered and she 
quickly retracted her hand.
	Sakura rolled over to face Hikari. &quot;...Mmmm... I think I fell 
asleep... what&#39;s the time?&quot;, Sakura asked groggily.
	Hikari twitched nervously and tried desparately to stop 
blushing. &quot;Um, it&#39;s, um, about 12 I think&quot;, she stammered.
	&quot;Hmmm... I&#39;m so tired... I think I&#39;ll go back to sleep... 
goodnight Kari.&quot;
	&quot;Goodnight Sakura&quot;, Hikari whispered, switching off the lamp 
beside the bed.
	When she was confident Sakura was asleep, she leant over an 
planted a tender kiss on her friend&#39;s soft cheek. &quot;I love you...&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hikari was in a real dilemma. Two years ago she admitted to 
herself that she had genuine feelings about her best friend, but she 
still hadn&#39;t done anything about it. It was pretty hard to imagine 
that Hikari and Sakura had met only five years ago, because to Hikari, 
Sakura felt like a life-long companion. And hopefully she would be.
	Hikari stared blankly into the distance as she walked alone to 
school. She wondered what would be worse. Telling Sakura how she felt, 
and being rejected by her one true love, or living out the rest of her 
life with a repressed heart.
	It was already hard enough finding lame excuses to reject the 
numerous advances directed at her from amorous boys. Luckily for her, 
Sakura hadn&#39;t started dating, saying that she wasn&#39;t ready to get into 
those things... yet. What would happen if Sakura did find a boy she 
liked and wanted to be with?
	&#39;Arrgghhh!! There are too many questions and problems!&#39;
	It would be best if Hikari just told Sakura her feelings, and 
Sakura said she felt the same, and they&#39;d weep and fall into each 
others&#39; arms.
	&#39;Obviously! But it&#39;s not that easy!!&#39;
	Caught up in her thoughts, Hikari was surprised to find that she 
had already made it to school. She was daydreaming like this all too 
often. Sakura was waiting, as usual, by the school gate. Over the past 
couple of years, Sakura had grown a fair bit taller, and her figure 
had matured significantly. Hikari was always pretty surprised that 
Sakura wasn&#39;t more popular with the boys, although her opinion of her 
friend was probably a tad biased.
	&quot;Good morning!&quot;
	&quot;Hey Kura, how&#39;s it going?&quot;
	&quot;Not bad. Did you bring your gym gear?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t forget everything, you know&quot;, Hikari teased.
	&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean it that way.&quot; Sakura blushed slightly 
before Hikari jabbed her lightly in the ribs and both girls giggled as 
they headed to their first class of the day.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Gym was always complicated for Hikari, but then again, 
everything else was too. She was with Sakura for most of every day 
(physically and in her head), but what happened in the change rooms 
was a bit too similar to Hikari&#39;s fantasies than she was comfortable 
with. Despite it being the first class of the day, the students were 
still required to wear their uniforms into school, and change into 
their sports gear before gym.
	Hikari followed Sakura into the girl&#39;s locker room and set her 
bag on the bench beside her friend&#39;s. Sakura was totally composed as 
she slipped her uniform shirt over her head and reached into her bag 
to get her gym shirt, but Hikari was a different story altogether. She 
couldn&#39;t help but stare at her friend&#39;s gorgeous figure, and felt as 
if her face was on fire.
	Sakura noticed Hikari as her head popped out from under her 
shirt.
	&quot;Are you okay Hikari?&quot; she asked, as her arms emerged from 
hiding as well.
	Hikari had to use all of her powers of concentration to free 
herself from the daze she was trapped in. She quickly turned away and 
rummaged through her bag.
	&quot;Ummm... yeah, where&#39;s my shirt?&quot; Her voice could hardly be 
heard with her face stuffed so deep in her bag.
	Sakura let out an exasperated sigh and had a little smile to 
herself. Hikari was always so silly!
	&quot;Here let me help you.&quot;
	Hikari stepped back as Sakura quickly ducked into her bag and 
withdrew her gym shirt.
	&#39;Maybe she&#39;ll help me undress too...&#39;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	&#39;I really gotta do something about my crush on Sakura...&#39;
	That was it. Hikari had made up her mind and was determined that 
one way or another, she was going to let her best friend know how she 
really felt. It didn&#39;t matter if Sakura didn&#39;t feel the same way, and 
Hikari was sure that they&#39;d be able to remain friends at least.
	&#39;But what can I do?? I can&#39;t just tell her straight off, that 
just wouldn&#39;t be right.&#39;
	There was a long weekend coming up, and that gave Hikari an 
idea. She would plan a romantic getaway for the two of them, except, 
it couldn&#39;t be obviously romantic, and set the right mood to reveal 
her long-suffered secret. Now all she had to do was enact her 
brilliant scheme!
	&quot;Are you dreaming again Miss Nakamura?!&quot;
	Thinking it was her teacher, Hikari bolted to her feet.
	&quot;Hikari, what are you doing?&quot; Sakura sweatdropped as her friend 
stood to attention in the middle of their lunch.
	&quot;Huh? Oh... I don&#39;t know, what am I doing?&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re asking me? You&#39;re so silly Hikari!&quot; Sakura took her 
friend by the hand and got her to sit down again.
	&quot;Hey Sakura, I was thinking... Do you wanna do anything for the 
long weekend?&quot;
	&quot;Did you have something in mind?&quot; Sakura asked as she took a 
bite of her dumpling.
	&quot;Um, I thought maybe we could go up to the hot springs at Mount 
Altera.&quot;
	&quot;That sounds great!&quot; Sakura&#39;s face lit up, and Hikari&#39;s did too 
in response. &quot;But won&#39;t that be really expensive?&quot;
	&quot;I think my mum would let us go. I haven&#39;t been on a holiday in 
ages anyway.&quot;
	&quot;Hikari, I can&#39;t do that...&quot;
	&quot;Come on! It&#39;ll be so much fun! I tell you what, we&#39;ll go ask my 
mum after school and see if it&#39;s okay, alright?&quot;
	&quot;Okay. I wonder if the hot springs are really as nice as people 
say?&quot;
	This time, it was Sakura who slipped into a little daydream. 
Hikari, on the other hand, was busy planning the next step in her epic 
strategy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	The sun shone down cheerily as Hikari and Sakura stepped off the 
coach. A gentle breeze wafted through the trees, and looking down the 
hillside gave a spectacular view. They were here. Mount Altera!
	Sakura could hardly contain her glee, rushing to pick up their 
bags and getting ready to explore the resort. It looked fantastic. The 
walkways leading to the individual chalets were lined with beautiful 
flowers and shrubs that neither girl had seen before. From their 
position, they could just make out the steam rising from what had to 
be the hot springs.
	&quot;Let&#39;s go!!&quot; Sakura&#39;s face broke out into the biggest smile ever 
as she thrust an ecstatic fist into the air.
	&quot;Sakura, I&#39;ve never seen you this excited before! I think we&#39;d 
better get our room to leave all our stuff before we have a look 
around.&quot;
	After picking up their key from the resort reception, the two 
girls headed to their chalet. Each of the little houses was separated 
from the others by trees, and they seemed to be fused in with the 
natural surroundings. Even though there were many buildings in the 
area, it hardly looked like a village or town.
	When they got to their chalet, Hikari was impressed. The 
entrance opened up into a comfortable sitting area with a small 
kitchen and dining room at the back. Beyond this, the chalet opened up 
to a spacious balcony, which overlooked the valley below. A ladder led 
up to the bedroom upstairs, giving the impression of a child&#39;s bunk 
bed. This was going to be great!
	&quot;Do you wanna get changed while I unpack?&quot; Hikari asked.
	&quot;Yes please!&quot; It was usually impossible to get Sakura to leave 
the work to Hikari, but she could hardly contain her eagerness to get 
into the hot springs!
	It wasn&#39;t long before both girls were into their swimming gear 
and ready to hit the hot springs. As they approached the springs, the 
air became thick with mist, and their sense of anticipation grew. The 
springs were screened off to form rooms of sorts, and Hikari and 
Sakura were lucky enough to get one that was unoccupied. The resort 
had also provided flowers, floating candles and bath oils to make the 
experience that little bit better.
	Sakura was the first to dip a tentative foot into the water. She 
hesitated just as the tips of her toes got wet.
	&quot;Is it okay? There&#39;s nothing wrong is there?&quot;
	Sakura turned and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s just that this is my first time 
in a hot spring, and I want to savour the occassion!&quot;
	Hikari rolled her eyes and wade into the delightfully hot water. 
Although she was hardly tired, Hikari felt as if the water worked to 
relax her muscles and ease away her fatigue.
	&quot;Mmmm... It feels like the water&#39;s washing away all my 
troubles&quot;, Sakura muttered as if reading Hikari&#39;s mind. Both girls 
closed their eyes and lay back, murmuring contented sighs as they 
lapped up the hospitality of nature.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	That evening, as Sakura was bathing, Hikari made herself busy 
downstairs. She had already placed her order for their dinner to be 
brought to the room, and was hurriedly trying to set up candles to get 
the mood just right. With the sun quickly setting behind the hills and 
no lights on in the chalet, the candles basked the surroundings in a 
warm orange-yellow glow. Hikari hoped she hadn&#39;t forgotten anything, 
because everything seemed perfectly set!
	Hikari had to wait another couple of minutes before the room 
service arrived. It was delivered by a fresh-faced young boy, and had 
been magnificantly presented on silver dishes. Hikari was too anxious 
to be much conversation, and the valet left with only a brief exchange 
of pleasantries.
	As if on cue, Sakura emerged from the bathroom, still towel 
drying her hair. She blinked in surprise at the absence of artificial 
light in the chalet, but initially didn&#39;t think much of it. As she 
made her way down the ladder though, her impressions of the occasion 
changed considerably.
	&quot;What&#39;s with all this, Hikari?&quot;
	Hikari blushed profusely, and mentally kicked herself for not 
thinking of an innocent excuse. &quot;Um, I thought that... uh, to 
celebrate our holiday, we should have a special dinner!&quot;
	&quot;This looks so nice! Everything&#39;s been done really nicely&quot;, 
Sakura seemed genuinely impressed as she took in the ambience, and 
Hikari let out a relieved sigh.
	&quot;Shall we get started with dinner?&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hikari rose from the table at the conclusion of their dinner to 
finish of the night with a good coffee. Sakura leant back in her chair 
and stretched her arms contentedly.
	&quot;That was the best meal I&#39;ve had in a while. Thanks Kari!&quot;
	&quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t really do much&quot;, Hikari couldn&#39;t justifiably take 
the credit, but was inwardly delighted that Sakura had enjoyed 
herself.
	Hikari returned to her seat after serving Sakura a large mug of 
her special mocha. As she cradled her own mug, she looked deeply into 
her special friend&#39;s eyes.
	&#39;Everything tonight has gone according to plan... It&#39;s now or 
never!&#39;
	Hikari firmed her resolve and pushed all her fears aside. This 
was the perfect moment to tell Sakura how she felt, and she wasn&#39;t 
going to let this opportunity escape her.
	&quot;Sakura... There was actually another reason I set everything up 
tonight... I&#39;ve got something I really need to tell you...&quot;
	In her nervousness, Hikari could barely maintain eye contact. 
Conversely, Sakura had no idea what her friend was on about, and 
tilted her head quizzically.
	&quot;What&#39;s up Kari?&quot;
	Hikari leant forward and took Sakura&#39;s delicate hand in her own. 
&quot;Sakura... I... I love you...&quot; Hikari words were scarcely a whisper.
	Sakura blushed slightly and sat up, having unintentionally 
leaned forward to hear Hikari&#39;s confession.
	&quot;Don&#39;t be silly Hikari! I know you love me. I love you too. Ever 
since we first met I knew you were always gonna be my best friend...&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t mean like that...&quot;
	&quot;Oh...&quot; Sakura looked a little sheepish as she the realisation 
hit her. Her mind went temporarily blank as she tried to fathom what 
had just transpired.
	Sakura&#39;s dazed expression made Hikari even more nervous than she 
already was. Thoughts filled her head of Sakura being completely 
disgusted and leaving her forever. It was more than she could bear to 
imagine.
	&quot;Um... Sakura I&#39;m sorry... I shouldn&#39;t have said that... I can 
understand if you don&#39;t feel the same and...&quot;
	&quot;No, Kari, it&#39;s alright&quot;, Sakura reassured her friend, &quot;I was 
just surprised, that&#39;s all. I just never expected something like that 
from you. Do you really feel that way?&quot;
	Hikari&#39;s hopes lifted exponentially as Sakura&#39;s words reached 
her ears. &quot;Yes! Sakura, I loved you for so long, but I&#39;ve never had 
the courage to tell you. I was so scared you&#39;d stop being my friend or 
something...&quot;
	Sakura silenced her friend with a comforting smile, before 
rising to her feet and outstretching her arms. Hikari was almost 
delirious with joy as she got up and gratefully accepted her love&#39;s 
warm embrace.
	&quot;Kari, no matter what happens, I&#39;ll never stop being your 
friend. You should know that.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m so silly...&quot;, Hikari&#39;s voice was little more than a mumble 
with her head buried in Sakura&#39;s shoulder.
	&#39;So everything turned out just right! Or almost...&#39;
	A mischievous glint emerged in Hikari&#39;s eye as she leant back, 
and gazed straight into Sakura&#39;s eyes. Sakura looked back curiously, 
before her big blue eyes widened in astonishment as Hikari&#39;s lips met 
her own. Hikari clenched her eyelids shut and hoped that this wouldn&#39;t 
ruin everything that had happened tonight.
	As she kissed her girlfriend, all of Hikari&#39;s emotions exploded. 
For her, it was a catharsis, releasing all of the feelings she had 
held inside for so long. All the times she had wanted to express 
herself, but ended up repressing what she felt were now forgotten.
	Hikari slowly broke off from the kiss, her lips lingering the 
last precious moments before parting. As she eased her eyes open, she 
saw Sakura&#39;s eyes were also closed.
	&#39;Yes! That means she liked it!&#39;
	Sakura mumured something as she opened her eyes, before 
focussing on Hikari. &quot;Kari... that was so nice...&quot;
	Hikari&#39;s heart almost jumped for joy as she took her friend in 
the biggest, warmest hug imaginable.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Hikari set down her pen as she completed her story. Maybe it 
wasn&#39;t exactly what had really happened between her and Sakura, but it 
captured her emotions truthfully. Satisfied with her effort, she rose 
from her seat and went to the window. A light snow was falling, 
blanketing the neighbourhood with a bright white cover.
	As Hikari&#39;s thoughts lingered on her story, she felt a familiar 
presence behind her. She leaned back in anticipation just as a pair of 
loving arms wrapped themselves around her slender waist.
	&quot;What were you doing before, Kari?&quot; Sakura asked, as she nuzzled 
her love&#39;s neck.
	&quot;Why don&#39;t you take a look for yourself...&quot;
