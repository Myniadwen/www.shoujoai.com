<h1>All Girls School (part 61 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch60.html">Back to Part 60</a><pre>&quot;Evening with the Light&quot;

It was December 8th, snowing lightly, and Corona Marcos was about to go 
swimming. Her brother Alonso was happy to take her&#151;if anything, to get 
her out of the house so she could exercise and socialize where he 
worked&#151;provided she hung around for his full shift. Being winter, of 
course, they went to an indoor pool. Corona had not wanted to stay 
indoors anyway, not with all that homework and the surrounding chill of 
her small house, and since she hadn&#39;t been swimming in years, indoors or 
out, it was a good time to go.

Being a modest 5&#39;4&quot; and tipping the scales at a healthy, feminine 130 
pounds, Marcos was unashamed of her body as she went into the locker 
room and undressed. She had company, all strangers, all of them with 
varying degrees of body type and shape. Some were Rubenesque and large, 
like manatees, and a few were old and wrinkly, like plastic bags that 
had been crumbled up too long. A few were reasonably shapely, but none 
of them were the &quot;standard for women&quot;: none could&#39;ve passed as a model, 
or an athlete, or the sexy star of fantasies everywhere. They were just 
themselves, unwilling to aspire to anything else, but that in itself was 
beautiful.

&quot;Hey, great bod.&quot; Her ears burned as she received an unexpected 
compliment from behind, and smiled when she felt a cool hand touch her 
Latino-skinned shoulders. She turned, not all the way around, and 
blushed as she recognized her girlfriend, Alexandra Blair, still fully 
dressed in that Gothic-punk-raver mix she was known for. She 
grinned&#151;Blair&#39;s shaggy mane was unnaturally green and quite 
attractive&#151;and turned around again, not daring to allow the girl she 
loved a glimpse at her nudity.

&quot;Allie, god, don&#39;t you know how to knock?&quot;

&quot;Hey, I can&#39;t help it if there ain&#39;t no doors round&#39; here. So anyway, 
nice coincidence seein&#39; ya here, babe. Lookin&#39; good.&quot;

&quot;Can I have some privacy?&quot; she squealed. Alex smiled and traced a finger 
across Corona&#39;s naked back.

&quot;Sure thing, sexy. Unless you wanna watch me undress.&quot;

&quot;Go, go!&quot; She laughed quietly and went to the other side of the room, 
hiding behind a row of lockers so they could talk. Corona sighed and 
slipped into her monochrome red swimsuit, wincing just a little as it 
squeezed. Oof&#151;maybe she did need a new one after all.

&quot;So what brings you here?&quot; she called. &quot;I haven&#39;t called you and we 
haven&#39;t spoken since yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Eh. I guess I don&#39;t know. I&#39;d like to call it fate, but it&#39;s more like 
coincidence. I really didn&#39;t expect it, but I sure as hell loved it. 
Damn though, girl, you seriously have one hot body.&quot; Corona smiled 
humbly, despite knowing she really did not.

&quot;If you say so.&quot;

&quot;Too bad I didn&#39;t get to see all of it. Hey, if ya ever wanna see me and 
my jollies&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass. What&#39;s with you, anyway?&quot; she giggled. &quot;You&#39;re not ever this 
flirty and...bouncy. It&#39;s like you&#39;re high on sugar and not...you know, 
that other stuff.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;ve been clean for months. Got my head all straight and fixed up 
and everything. I&#39;m thinking clearly now, I&#39;m not as emo, I&#39;m being more 
careful, shit like that. I&#39;ve changed a lot.&quot;

&quot;You have indeed,&quot; she murmured to herself. She called out to Alex that 
she was done; the other girl came walking out quietly but proudly, 
grinning all the way. Corona stared, hard. Blair was always a little 
skinny, but ever since quitting drugs and her nightlife, she had filled 
out to a more reasonable size and looked better for it&#151;and the skimpy 
black bikini with skulls on the breasts and backside certainly helped 
accentuate her figure. Marcos was left breathless&#151;she had never seen so 
much of Alexandra&#39;s skin before!

&quot;And you think I&#39;m hot?&quot; she said mindlessly. Green-hair whistled.

&quot;In that thing? You bet, Roni! Damn, I kinda feel all horny now.&quot; Corona 
grinned at such attention, and gave her girlfriend a come-hither motion 
that could not be resisted, least of all by somebody who wanted it. 
Blair strolled over, squealing sensually, and descended into her 
girlfriend&#39;s arms to share several passionate kisses. Corona accepted 
her green-haired girlfriend as she wrapped her pale naked thighs around 
her waist and straddled her; their arms entwined around each others&#39; 
bodies, as lips so too entwined, and they stayed locked until 
interrupted.

&quot;Oh, get a room, you dykes.&quot;

&quot;Shut the fuck up, you&#151;&quot; Blair interrupted herself as she saw who 
interrupted them, and made a face. Not an angry one, not a happy one, 
not even one that could be defined. It was gnarled, wrought with 
multiple emotions&#151;her eyes glittered with more precision. Their guest 
rolled her eyes.

&quot;Well, well, well. If it isn&#39;t the homophobic friend of our dear Miss 
Tran! So how&#39;s the world of the penis, miss Kwan? Gotten fucked well by 
that prick yet?&quot;

&quot;Grow up,&quot; groaned Farrah, turning her back to the two as she changed.

&quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you? Corona and I are just spending some quality time 
together, and you&#151;&quot;

&quot;Just drop it, Allie,&quot; said Marcos gently, touching her emerald hair. 
Their eyes met as the less aggressive of the two touched Blair&#39;s naked 
skin, begging quietly. &quot;Okay?&quot; Alex smiled in defeat and pressed their 
noses together. Corona just loved Eskimo kisses.

&quot;Since when did you start calling me Allie?&quot;

&quot;Since now. Want me to stop, Allie?&quot;

&quot;God, no, you make it sound great. Allie, huh? As opposed to Haley?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Your whole name&#39;s a mouthful and I don&#39;t really like calling you 
Alex or Lexie cuz&#39; of that other girl, so you need a nickname of your 
own.&quot;

&quot;What, you don&#39;t like Haley?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not Haley,&quot; said Corona, tickling the girl&#39;s palms. &quot;You&#39;re 
Allie, my Allie, pretty and sweet.&quot;

&quot;Bah, don&#39;t say that.&quot; Hail&#151;&quot;Allie&quot; now, it seemed&#151;didn&#39;t like people 
sweet-talking her, and the attention embarrassed her. But it was Corona, 
so it was okay. &quot;Anyway,&quot; she said, giving a snide leer at Farrah, &quot;what 
are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t come for your heckling,&quot; she answered, putting her top on 
gracefully. &quot;Just to swim, so back off. And a word of warning: you talk 
trash about Tristan again in my presence, and I&#39;ll make you wish you 
were cleaning the school at Homecoming again.&quot;

&quot;Ouch,&quot; grimaced Alex. &quot;God, that&#39;s rough. Well, bitches of a feather 
flock together.&quot;

&quot;Allie, come on.&quot; Blair groaned.

&quot;But she&#39;s a frickin&#39; homophobe!!&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t think homosexuality is right,&quot; snapped Farrah as she left. 
&quot;I&#39;m not afraid of it, just intolerant.&quot;

&quot;May as well be the same thing,&quot; Hail muttered when she was gone. She 
sighed and refocused on Corona, but Marcos brushed her off and slipped 
away. &quot;Hey...&quot;

&quot;You were pretty cold back there, Allie. Looks like you still have some 
changing to do.&quot; She disappeared from the locker room and went to the 
pool; Alex grunted and ran her hand over her face. Defeated. From good 
to bad, just like that. Just for some remarks off the side to a girl she 
barely knew.

&quot;Damn it... Why do I always fuck this stuff up?&quot;

Alex scanned the pool for Corona, and found her, in all places, talking 
with Farrah. She walked over, ready to kiss butt and make up, but the 
two noticed her and warded her off with nasty looks.

&quot;I&#39;m not talking to you,&quot; said Corona bitterly. &quot;Not after the way you 
treated Farrah. She doesn&#39;t deserve it. Go off somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Babe, I&#39;m sorry, okay?&quot;

&quot;Go off somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Babe!&quot; Corona brushed her off with a wave. Farrah gave her a dirty 
look. Alex cursed loud enough to be overheard by several sensitive 
people, who in turn pointed her out and had her escorted out of the 
pool. She gave Corona a desperate look as she was forced out, but she 
didn&#39;t come to her defense. Alex cursed again, feeling the full familiar 
range of misery sweep over her again as she was shoved outside, in the 
freezing parking lot, with only her swimsuit and belongings. What had 
she done?

&quot;Shit, it&#39;s freezing!&quot; she hissed. She quickly got inside her rotting 
car, knowing anything was better than standing out in the cold, and 
cranked up the heater to full blast. It barely coughed. She swore again 
and bumped her head against the wheel. Well, another barrier to 
overcome...

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about Allie. She&#39;s not normally that rude.&quot;

&quot;You better watch that one, Corona,&quot; advised Farrah, who found the 
atmosphere much more pleasant with the furious one gone. &quot;She&#39;s bad news 
all the way through. I mean, okay, so my best friend messed with her 
mind, but she was twisted to begin with. What do you see in her?&quot;

&quot;I guess we&#39;re just two twisted souls. She and I...we&#39;re very alike. I 
can feel her pain...&quot;

&quot;Marcos, that thing doesn&#39;t feel pain, okay? She always gives and never 
receives&#151;real generous, huh?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; Corona murmured gently. &quot;Allie&#39;s got her problems but 
she&#39;s really good underneath. I&#39;ve learned to bear the worst of her 
because I&#39;ve borne it myself all my life, from my own experiences.&quot;

&quot;Corona... You have got to be seriously messed up to like her.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s me in a nutshell,&quot; she admitted with a gesture. &quot;I would take 
offense, but you have no idea how right you are.&quot;

&quot;Come on, I like you. You&#39;re all right. You&#39;re really sweet&#151;a bit weird 
and standoffish, but sweet. Furious Hail is a disaster.&quot;

&quot;I have to try, Farrah. She&#39;s been great to me. We understand each 
other. I mean, sure I&#39;m mad at her now, but I still love her too. 
Eventually we&#39;ll calm down and I&#39;ll have her apologize.&quot;

&quot;She insulted my Tristan,&quot; said Kwan stubbornly. &quot;The guy can be a jerk 
sometimes, but he doesn&#39;t mean it and he tries really hard. I still&#151;&quot;

&quot;Love him?&quot; Farrah nodded, but the full scope of what she was saying 
didn&#39;t strike her until a little later. She sighed and drew her legs to 
her chest, floating quietly in the shallow end. Corona sank down a 
little until her knees were touching the bottom.

&quot;So you feel the same way about Furious Hail as I do about my 
boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Farrah smiled sadly.

&quot;I guess we&#39;re both hopeless romantics. Corona, I still don&#39;t like the 
whole idea. I think you&#39;d be much better with a boyfriend. Are you sure 
you&#39;re gay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not gay, I just love Allie. If that makes me gay, fine. I 
just...want to love her. Sometimes I think that&#39;s really why I was born, 
to help her. People everywhere need help, but she needs it a lot. You 
know me. You know my affect on people, how I always seem to make their 
day go better. It&#39;s the same with Allie, but stronger. I just...love 
her.&quot;

&quot;Unconditionally?&quot;

&quot;Well, she does love me back. I can see it. She&#39;s really...very sweet 
around me. She just needs to work with her non-twisted soul relation 
skills. With you, for example. I bet there&#39;s nary a part of you that&#39;s 
messed up.&quot;

&quot;Oh, just enough.&quot;

&quot;But nowhere near our level.&quot;

&quot;Hey,&quot; she said defensively, &quot;those are your words, not mine.&quot; Marcos 
smiled graciously, and swam a few slow laps until she became tired. 
Farrah waded around, feeling good that she could carry such a meaningful 
conversation with the other girl. Just because she didn&#39;t tolerate the 
actions and lifestyle of a lesbian, that didn&#39;t give her the right to be 
mean to them, or isolate them. They&#151;all gay people&#151;had enough problems 
without her adding things. It was Alexandra that...

&quot;So what&#39;re you gonna do?&quot; she asked. Marcos was doing the backstroke; 
she answered carefully, not wanting to break her concentration.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m gonna swim until I start to prune, then I&#39;ll dry off and go 
read until Alonso gets off work&#151;he&#39;s that lifeguard over there, my 
brother.&quot; Farrah looked over and smiled.

&quot;Oh, him? Handsome guy.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. After that, I&#39;ll do my homework and get some other things done. 
Then I&#39;ll call Allie and see if we can&#39;t make up.&quot;

&quot;You really going through with it?&quot;

&quot;Sure, I want this relationship to last. I really do.&quot; Farrah grinned.

&quot;Girl, I hope you know what you&#39;re getting into. I&#39;d wish you luck, but 
I don&#39;t believe in that, and you&#39;d need more than I could give anyway. 
Just...try to keep her tolerable at least.&quot;

&quot;You should get to know her. She&#39;s really wonderful.&quot;

&quot;No thanks. Ivory is enough for me.&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s a story,&quot; laughed Marcos. &quot;How do you tolerate her?&quot;

&quot;Amigo, sometimes I wonder myself. But then I tell myself, &#145;Farrah, she 
owes you big-time, so until she makes it up to you, you can surely hold 
out&#39;. At least her girlfriend&#39;s doing a good job of keeping her leashed. 
Ancelin&#39;s...been nice to her. I hope they last. Ivory&#39;s not keen on 
long-term relationships.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot;

&quot;I hope you two last too,&quot; she whispered kindly. &quot;If for no other 
reason, to see that monster improve. God, I still can&#39;t get it around my 
head!&quot; Corona chuckled and splashed Farrah, who in turn gasped and 
splashed back so much that Alonso Marcos himself had to break them up.

.........

Allie. It sounded like a new version of her, like she had truly been 
reborn into a new life, away from the scum of Furious Hail and the bleak 
seasons of Old Alexandra. Allie. Like she actually mattered, and 
somebody loved her. Allie. Corona said it with such adoration. Allie. 
Allie. What a name. Blair liked it. She would have to ask everyone to 
call her that from now on. Allie. But she would keep the dyes. No way 
would she ever go back to her original hair color. &quot;Allie&quot; was good 
enough.

Allie Blair. It had a nice ring to it.

Ring? Her phone was ringing. It was Corona.

&quot;Yo.&quot;

&quot;Hey. Uh...you wanna meet before Keys&#39; class so we can talk?&quot;

&quot;Sure. And sit together too?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Pause.

&quot;I&#39;m real sorry, Corona. I really am.&quot;

&quot;I know, sweetheart.&quot; Sweetheart. What a thing to call her. Alexandra 
nearly wept. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m busy, so I&#39;m gonna hang up. Seeya tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, bye.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot; Click. Alex sighed.

&quot;I love you, Corona.&quot; And then, she did weep.

They smiled at each other as they met by the lockers across from the 
only class they shared together, but did nothing else&#151;no kiss, no hug, 
not even a handshake. Just a smile, but it was enough, and it was good.

&quot;Hey. You look nice.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Not going Goth today?&quot; Alex&#151;Allie now&#151;looked down at her 
button-down white business shirt and long black dress, and looked back 
with a smile.

&quot;Thought I&#39;d go classy today and prove to you I&#39;m not some punk kid.&quot;

&quot;I know you&#39;re not, Allie.&quot;

&quot;God, I love that name.&quot; The girls chuckled, breaking the little 
remaining ice around them, and finally touched as they sighed and went 
in for reconciliation. &quot;Hey, uh, I talked to Farrah today. God, she was 
pissed. She nearly smacked me, but said it&#39;d bring her down to my level. 
Whatever; she let it go and forgave me, but told me the usual shit: 
&#145;Don&#39;t talk that way again or I&#39;ll kill you!&#39; Just not in those words.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. So you&#39;re cool now?&quot;

&quot;As cool as possible. I wouldn&#39;t make her a friend of mine, but...&quot;

&quot;Yeah...she really thinks you&#39;re bad.&quot;

&quot;Oh, but I am.&quot; The gleam in her eye, the smile on her lips, the way she 
growled playfully and advanced...Corona laughed and slapped her gently.

&quot;Stop it, that&#39;s not what I meant!&quot;

&quot;You like naughty girls!&quot; said Allie, her voice muffled as she buried 
her lips in Corona&#39;s neck. Marcos half-laughed, half-moaned, and it was 
only by the grace of the bell and Mrs. Keys&#39; polite interruption that 
they were stopped at all.

&quot;As happy as I am seeing you two together,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;d be much 
happier if you were in your seats now.&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; So they went inside, grinning and holding hands, and waved 
to a few students who adored them as a couple (most notably Ana, 
Gabrielle, and yes, even Ancelin). As they began the day&#39;s 
projects&#151;really the last serious ones before winter break came&#151;Allie 
kissed her girlfriend&#39;s ear and whispered something while she was at it.

&quot;I was thinking...&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;d like to come over to my house for New Year&#39;s?&quot; Corona 
grinned happily.

&quot;I&#39;d love to. You doing anything on Christmas?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m spending it with Mrs. Keys. Yeah, my idiot father apparently got 
invited to her house for the holidays, so I&#39;ll have to shack up with 
Jocelyn and/or Erica. Probably both with the way they&#39;re going. Makes ya 
sick.&quot; Her smile said anything but.

&quot;Oh. Well, I&#39;m not really doing anything, just midnight mass. I&#39;m also 
visiting my mother, for what good it does.&quot;

&quot;Hey, at least you&#39;ve got a mom. I haven&#39;t seen mine since I was like, 
ten.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but she doesn&#39;t recognize me.&quot; Allie nodded.

&quot;I know how that feels.&quot; And kissed Corona softly, lovingly. She wanted 
to tell the girl how she felt, but...not here. Not yet. They still had a 
lot of work to be done, in more ways than one, before the final, fateful 
night of December 31st, 2004.
