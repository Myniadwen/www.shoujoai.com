<p align="justify"><strong><u>Inside   the girl's fitting room....</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella's   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Shamefully,   I couldn't stop myself from moaning at times when Elila gently heals   my back. I can feel the warm healing again for the third time, yet somehow   it adds with a gentle caress from her. I know she gave her word that   she won't take advantage of my situation, but as she touches my back   lightly, it seems my world wants to explode to pieces. I moaned softly   again, as she brings such shivers inside my body. I know that she meant   it well, but with her gentle touching, I don't seem to mind at all. <strong><em> 'Bad Isa...She&rsquo;s your friend!'</em></strong> my mind screamed at me. But   I couldn't help it; she makes me feel beautiful somehow. </p>
<p align="justify">I buried my   face in her soft hair, unconditionally caressing her hair with my fingers.   I sense her breathing coming short and fast as she struggles to control   herself again from me. I could even hear a soft plea from her, saying <strong> "Please God, help me to control myself!" </strong> and guiltily, I stopped myself from touching her hair and gave a sighed.   This is how I imagine myself to be friends with Elila at this moment...but   it seems weird that our behaviour towards each other...seems...not in   a friendship's category. I even could feel myself getting a little uncomfortable   between my legs that I still can't quite understand yet. And sometimes   when I keep shifting myself on Elila's lap, my nipples becomes so hard   and sensitive and somehow grinding with Elila's breasts with my movement.   I hear her whimper out loud and her body becomes as stiff as a rock.   I could even see from her shoulders; her left hand is gripping the wood   bench dangerously. I don't know why, but I couldn't help myself reaching   for it and placed it on my shoulder. I feel her body jerk in surprised,   but I huskily whispered to her ear. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Don't   hurt yourself. Just hold me." </strong></p>
<p align="justify">She holds my   shoulder softly as a response and continued her healing on my back.   There were still moans from me, adding with a little grinding with my   nipples on hers. I could feel her nipples harden painfully as her left   hand holds my shoulder, wanting me to just stop....but I couldn't. So   naively, I kept on doing that, loving the feeling of the sensation that   I had and sadly, I feel Elila's right hand placed on my other shoulder. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It's   done,"</strong> she said weakly. </p>
<p align="justify">I sighed sadly   yet relieved that I could now feel my back painlessly. I pulled away   from her and still see her closing her eyes still. She kept her word. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It's   your turn to guide me now,"</strong> she said like a soft command and   raises her right hand to me to take it. </p>
<p align="justify">As I look at   her hand, I see a green and white energy forming on her fair palm. I   look at it in wonder and slowly taking it with my right hand. First,   I guide her hand to my bruised arm, that Melvin had gripped it tightly   last night. Trying to not think about him, I placed her hand on my arm,   as she gently caresses it and the warmness of the healing spreads in   me nicely. I have gotten used of the feeling on that area for all the   times that Elila healed me. Not long after that, my arm was as fine   as before. And this is the nervous part now.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Now   it's your..."</strong> Elila asked nervously.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Yeah..."</strong> I squeaked and hurriedly take her hand to guide her to my breasts that   was roughly been hold by Melvin. He left a few bruises there for being   to rough on me last night. But because I didn't carefully placed it   a little distance from my breasts, I accidentally guided her hand very   near towards my breasts, as one of my nipples touches her palm. And   because my nipples are still sensitively hardened, I gasped in pleasure   and accidentally arch my back as my right breast is readily cupped by   Elila's hand. I hear her yelp and struggles hard to not open her eyes.   As for I, making the matters worse, I try to move a little for her to   be comfortable, but I make her even more flushed as my breast also moves   under her palm. And adding without much help to her, I moaned in intense   pleasure and closed my eyes, loving the feel of her hand on me. I can   hear her growling dangerously and I suppose to be scared...but I find   it very erotic of the thought of it. But then, she roughly yet softly,   holds me nearer to her until I could feel her hot breath on my neck.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Whatever   you do Isa, DON'T MOVE!"</strong> she growled. Obediently as I tried,   I kept still but still losing myself to the feeling of her palm on my   breast.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Outside   the girl's fitting room.....</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Elila   seems to be taking long in there," </strong> said Tara worriedly as she looks at her time watch.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"It's   ten more minutes before the bell rings,"</strong> said Tina a little   annoyed, as she is quite a punctual one.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Hush,   I believe in Cousin Lee...she will come out on time. Be patient with   her,"</strong> Leo said patiently to the female twins as Maria just   looked away sadly for a moment.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Yeah...she's   probably mating in there,"</strong> said Lucas grumpily under his breath. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What   did you say?!"</strong> demanded Leo to his brother.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   said I want some lasagne!"</strong> Lucas lied at his brother and giving   his best puppy eyes look. Leo just rolled his eyes and shakes his head,   and waited patiently for his cousin to come out.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong><u>Inside   the girl's fitting room.....</u></strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Elila&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I swear that   I just died and went to heaven! It&rsquo;s a little bit hard for me to control   the situation right now as my eyes are tightly shut right now. As much   as I want to open my eyes, but because I gave my word to little belle   and also the fact that she is half naked on my lap&hellip;my human side strongly   suggests not to. The beast seems to be quite aware that my future mate   is right where it suppose to be and demands for me to claim her&hellip;but   I couldn&rsquo;t. I won&rsquo;t!</p>
<p align="justify">Her moans is   quite deafening to my eyes. It sounds so beautiful and erotic but also   at the same time, quite a torture for me at the moment. I can feel Isabella   moving front to back on my lap, as if she is grinding on me. Her soft   breast that I now cupped accidentally was as hard as pebbles that I   so wish to caress it. I can feel the healing energy from me is doing   the work greatly on her&hellip;but right now, can I control myself from her?</p>
<p align="justify">I breathed   hotly on her neck and try not to nuzzle my lips on her skin. Her left   hand holds my head from the back firmly as she arches her back to me.   It was getting too much for me especially when she is not my mate yet&hellip;.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Isabella,   please! I need you to stay still!&rdquo;</strong> I growled loudly as I could   feel the fire in me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   trying Elila but&hellip;but&hellip;aaahhh&hellip;..feels good...please touch it firmly   please!&rdquo;</strong> she cried as she moans in pleasure and keeps pushing   her breast to my hand. Her lips eagerly nibble my earlobe, as I yelped   a little by the slight pain and pleasure. I groaned a little with a   slight hint of lust for her. I know what she meant by that as she eagerly   shows it by pushing her breast on my palm. By then, the healing has   stopped, finishing its last task. I wish I can obey her right now&hellip;touch   her right there and show her how much she means to me. But honestly,   I didn&rsquo;t even make a move.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;No&hellip;I   can&rsquo;t Isa&hellip;please stop before we both regret what happens next&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong> I said slowly.</p>
<p align="justify">I hear her   sigh in frustration as she tries to slow down her grinding. I wait for   her to stop as I hear her sobbing a little. I immediately felt angry   at myself for making her cry&hellip;but what can I do? She hugs me as she   cries a little and I try the hardest to ignore the feeling of her hard   nipples tightly to my breasts as mine became somewhat sensitive right   now. I hug her back and caress her hair lightly, giving her soothing   words.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Why&hellip;.don&rsquo;t   you touch me&hellip;god, it feels so good&hellip;.feels amazing&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> she   cried softly on my neck. I didn&rsquo;t know how to answer her; I&rsquo;m not   sure what&rsquo;s the right answer to say anyway. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I love   you Isa but I won&rsquo;t take you here&hellip;don&rsquo;t get me wrong ok?&rdquo;</strong> I soothed her gently.</p>
<p align="justify">I felt her   pulled away from me as she touches my cheek gently. My eyes were still   shut as I experience the soft touch that fills my stomach with butterflies   feeling.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You do   keep you word, do you?&rdquo;</strong> she asked me softly. I just nodded her   as an answer. I could feel her smile as I feel her leaning in and lightly   kisses my right cheek. I was surprised by the sudden intimacy that we   never had before but I just smiled back.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Now,   could you please&hellip;erm&hellip;dress up because I can&rsquo;t open my eyes at   this moment&hellip;..you know&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> I said nervously.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Oh right!   Sure! I&rsquo;ll&hellip;.go and get dress&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> she said, probably realizing   that she&rsquo;s still half-naked as she hesitantly got off my lap and I   hear her moving to get her clothes. I waited patiently for her to dress   up before opening my eyes.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   done! You can open your eyes now!&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p align="justify">I slowly open   my eyes, seeing if she is really wearing clothes before opening my eyes   fully. I check her appearances just to see if she&rsquo;s healed completely.   She&rsquo;s wearing a baby T-shirt that fits all the right curves on her   top body. Hmm&hellip;she must have extra clothes for emergency in her locker.   She still looks amazing&hellip;.and also quite inviting with her hair sort   of wild right now and also her skin seems to glow a little. I got up   from the bench, stretching my legs like a cat and moved towards her.   She just seems to stand there, looking at me calmly as if she is not   scared of me. I blinked a little, thinking is this a progress of mating?   Are we both in the middle of it right now&hellip;.or still the beginning   of the progress? <strong><em>&lsquo;Elila&hellip;she&rsquo;s your friend!! Don&rsquo;t think   like that! She doesn&rsquo;t want to have anything with you! Nothing romantic   remember?!&rsquo; </em></strong>I thought to myself, scolding myself. Simply ignoring   what I thought, I stand in front of her as I brought my hands up to   gently comb her hair, trying to make it not wild. She seems to be quite   obedient as she remains quiet and allows me to do my magic on her hair.   Few minutes have passed and I take a step back to admire my work. Her   hair looks great again as I signalled Isabella to say that I&rsquo;m done. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;</strong> she said shyly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re   welcome Isa. Now you go out of this room first so people won&rsquo;t be   suspicious later,&rdquo;</strong> I said softly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;But what   about you?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll   leave a few minutes after you left. Don&rsquo;t worry about me alright?&rdquo;</strong> I chuckled a little, find it weird that Isabella seems worried about   me but I felt somehow&hellip;loved. She nodded slowly and takes her bag and   books from the bench and quickly walks out to the door. But before she   opens the door to the world, she looks back at me and said, <strong>&ldquo;Thank   you!&rdquo; </strong>and opens the door and walk out of it. With that, I take   a few deep breaths, now trying to control my raging needs of intimacy.   I quickly went to the shower place&hellip;went to the sink and splashes cold   water on my face. I struggle hard and look myself at mirror, oh god!   I look wild right now&hellip;but in sense of someone that is in lust. My   hair was so wild and my clothes seem to be a little&hellip;well, in a mess.   I quickly comb my hair with my hands rapidly, trying my best to make   my hair to be at its place and also adjusting my clothes. My hands were   trembling because of still trying to gain control of myself&hellip;.not letting   the lust to win at all. It was a great struggle as I try to compose   myself greatly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;If this   is how I get just by getting grinded or so&hellip;I wonder how about making   love,&rdquo;</strong> I mumbled sarcastically.</p>
<p align="justify">After awhile,   confident that I&rsquo;m alright to get out from this room, I take a deep   breath and open the door. The breeze welcomes me and I welcome it too   by breathing in softly. I could see my cousins from the distance, sitting   down waiting for me as I waved at them to come to me. Immediately they   came as they rushed forward, ignoring the people&rsquo;s stares and lust   looks at them. I just stand right there, waiting for them; completely   oblivious of what is happening around me as my cousins come closer and   closer towards me. Leo reaches me first and hugs me protectively, then   the girls and Lucas.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;That   took long dear cousin, we thought something might happened to you in   there,&rdquo;</strong> said Leo with a concerned look. <strong>&ldquo;Was everything alright?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Ye&hellip;yeah&hellip;everything   went well&hellip;Isabella is as good as new!&rdquo; </strong> I said slowly, couldn&rsquo;t quite tell him what happened between little   belle and I in there.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes,   we saw her coming out from the room&hellip;.she looks great again! Good work!&rdquo;</strong> said Tina with her thumbs up. I just smiled back at her giving my thanks. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;So really   Cousin Lee&hellip;.did you have like&hellip;sex in there?&rdquo;</strong> said Lucas impatiently   as my face grew hot with embarrassment and a little hint of annoyance.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;LUCAS!&rdquo;</strong> said all my cousins at him, giving him a hard glare.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;What?   I&rsquo;m just asking her! Well, did you?&rdquo;</strong> said Lucas eagerly, still   not understanding why the question seems to be&hellip;a little too much somehow.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;</strong> I said firmly, trying to control my embarrassment and the desire to   hit him. </p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Man!   You&rsquo;re boring! You could be the first person to mate&hellip;.OWWW!!!&rdquo;</strong> Lucas shouted a little as my cousins hit him on the head many times.   As for me, I really think we should teach him what is appropriate to   say in public and also some manners!</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;So, you   guys did a great job too! Making the entire population of girls to not   enter this room,&rdquo;</strong> I said giving them a hint of gratitude.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Oh! You   must give the credit to Maria actually! She did it!&rdquo;</strong> Leo said   proudly, giving a pat on Maria&rsquo;s back as Maria just look down and   smiled shyly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Really?   So what did you do Maria? Did you make a illusion that the door was   not there?&rdquo;</strong> I asked eagerly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Uh, no,&rdquo;</strong> she said, shaking her head.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;a   barrier to not come through?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Ummm&hellip;an   illusions of rats crawling in front of the door so the girls won&rsquo;t   go through?&rdquo; </strong>I asked stupidly. My other cousins look at me with   a funny glare but I just shrugged.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Not that   I know of&hellip;&rdquo;</strong> said Maria, a bit surprised of my stupid question.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Okay&hellip;then?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She just pointed   to the fitting room&rsquo;s door. I look at me closely and didn&rsquo;t find   anything weird. It takes me awhile to realize that there&rsquo;s a sign   board right in front of the door saying;</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&ldquo;Cleaning   in progress.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Please Do   not enter&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; </strong> I said incredulously as she looks down shyly again. A very interesting   idea of hers&hellip;and I smiled at her and touches her left arm lightly,   wanting her to look at me. When she did, I gave her a soft <strong>&ldquo;thank   you&rdquo;</strong> and finally, the school bell rings the school is going to   begin.&nbsp; Pupils start to rush to their classes as my cousins and   I just slowly walk to our own classes. As we are nearer to our classes,   my cousins and I separated and each went to their classes individually.   On my way to my class, I bumped into Mrs. Graham as she asked me politely.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Morning   Elila, I expect everything is well with the school and so?&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes Mrs.   Graham, everything is going well</strong>,&rdquo; I said, giving myself a knowing   smile as I bowed a little at her and dismissed myself to enter my class,   Writing.</p>
<p align="justify">*********************</p>
<p align="justify">On my 3rd   period, Tina and I walk into our English Literature class. When every   time I walk into this class, my heart seems to be pounding faster and   faster. As we entered, I could see some people looking at us as we find   our sits in the middle of the class. I could hear voices of curiosity,   lust and admiration as some guys tries to <strong>&lsquo;court&rsquo;</strong> Tina while   some guys or mostly girls&rsquo; tries to flirt with me. We always give   our polite smiles and talk to them but never to lead them on if we have   no sexual feelings for them. While talking to them, I found two empty   sits and signalled Tina to come and sit down. She acknowledged me and   gives her polite smile to the guys and sat beside me. While waiting   for our teacher to arrive, Tina went to do some poetry reading while   I look around the class slowly. I know why I always seems to be doing   that. It&rsquo;s not because of the security. No. It&rsquo;s because at the   back of the class, I know that Isabella and her so-called popular friends   are sitting there, chatting the latest gossips and fashion and boys.   And now, as I laid my eyes on Isabella, I could hear my heart beating   loudly to my ears as I recalled what had happened to the both of us   in the locker room. Even though I was <strong><em>&lsquo;blind&rsquo;</em></strong> at that   time, but I felt that it was so erotic for me until it seems to effect   my whole being, awakening something inside. My breathing becomes a little   shallow as I feel my body feeling a little bit hot as I remembered little   belle&rsquo;s erotic moans a few hours back. It was a little too much as   I grip my books a little too hard on my desk.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Elila,   are you alright?&rdquo;</strong> asked my cousin worriedly.</p>
<p align="justify">A bit embarrassed   of getting caught, I just mumbled <strong>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m alright,&rdquo;</strong> to   her and take a few deep breaths to calm myself down. Tina just stared   at me for awhile, then shrugs it off and continues her reading. Once   I know that I&rsquo;m able to control my needs, I look slowly at Isabella   and somehow taken by surprised that Isabella is looking directly at   me from her sitting place. Did she catch me looking at her? I couldn&rsquo;t   seem to look anywhere to hide my embarrassment of getting caught again;   yet I just stare at her like she is this mysterious creature that I   just found&hellip;.just like when we first met four years back. What seems   to feel like eternity, I see her luscious lips curve into a big smile   that makes me realized that she didn&rsquo;t mind me looking at her, so   I smiled back and give a slight bow of respect. Things are getting a   little interesting between us and we have no idea what it is&hellip;are we   acting innocent <strong><em>&lsquo;victims&rsquo;</em></strong> towards each other or perhaps   something even more beautiful? But then again, that&rsquo;s just my wishful   thinking.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In the middle   of our conversation, I saw Elila coming in the class with her cousin.   Some people just seem to melt whenever they come in. Ha, what did my   friends called them? The Greek group? It&rsquo;s pathetic I know, but because   it seems all of them including Elila, seem to be unbelievably beautiful   or gorgeous like God has created another beautiful species than us.   Though they are not in the popular crowd, but everybody including us   popular crowd can&rsquo;t help admiring them. Unfortunately for my friends,   as soon as they found out that I was chosen to be Elila&rsquo;s mate, they   began to have doubts about her. Saying that she won&rsquo;t give me what   I want&hellip;she a girl&hellip;and many other things. Now I know it sounds a   little homophobic, but honestly, they are a bit narrow-minded when it   comes to their selfishness. Sometimes I even think it&rsquo;s a little pathetic   because I know some of these girls are so into Elila. But they think   I don&rsquo;t about it&hellip;they think I&rsquo;m so na&iuml;ve in this group. Ha! Yeah   Right! So&hellip;why am I in this so-called crowd? Hmm&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;I   can&rsquo;t answer that question yet because I&rsquo;m afraid to find the right   answer. Probably the need to fit in. Yeah, I guess that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p align="justify">I didn&rsquo;t   pay attention much during the conversation, just giving my fake smiles   to them and give my comments until I sense Elila&rsquo;s eyes on me. I slowly   look at her and I see her controlling herself again and her cousin was   asking her about something, looking worried. I can see Elila&rsquo;s face   flushed, but I&rsquo;m not sure why. Is she unwell&hellip;or is it because of   me? Okay, I don&rsquo;t want to answer that question. Apart of me keeps   on bugging me to concentrate on the conversation that lay before me&hellip;but   my heart just wants me to continue staring at her&hellip;as if there will   be a reward by doing that. I try not to chuckle with the thought of   that, because it sounds so crazy really. But when Elila looks at me,   realizing that I caught her staring at me just now&hellip;she tries to hide   it but couldn&rsquo;t seem to move her eyes away from me. In a state, she   looks unbelievably adorable like an innocent doe for the first time.   Then, I flash a smile at her&hellip;and she smiled back with her silver eyes   looking directly into my eyes. I suddenly stop breathing in a second,   staring into those eyes&hellip;as it reaches to my soul. Her eyes that is   so mysterious beautiful&hellip;that holds a lot of secrets&hellip;that makes me   drawn into her for the first time. Oh yeah&hellip;it&rsquo;s a reward that I   long for&hellip;to make me realize about myself.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>HELLO   ISA!! What&rsquo;s up with you girl?! Didn&rsquo;t you hear what I said?&rdquo;</strong> asked Pamela dramatically.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Yeah!   Whatcha looking at? Wait, are you looking at a cute boy?&rdquo;</strong> asked   Cherry excitedly, looking around the class room eagerly.</p>
<p align="justify">Realizing that   I was caught by my friends, I tore my eyes away from Elila&rsquo;s and try   to find the rights answer to say to them.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Huh?   Ermm..I&hellip;&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p align="justify">Okay, that&rsquo;s   not a good answer.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Girl?!   Who were you looking at?&rdquo;</strong> demanded Pamela.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Probably   that half-breed girl, Elila,&rdquo;</strong> said Lily, rolling her eyes.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Lily!   Stop calling her half-breed!&rdquo;</strong> I snapped back at her. Among the   group, Lily is really a pain in the butt. She&rsquo;s the top cheerleader   and knows well that she has a body of a model. She gets what she wants   and comes from a rich family.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>What?   I heard it from Melvin. Can&rsquo;t blame him right?&rdquo;</strong> said Lily levelly.</p>
<p align="justify">I stared at   her in surprised. Since when did Melvin and she talk to each other? <strong> &ldquo;Well&hellip;not that I have to agree with him. And don&rsquo;t be a hypocrite   Lily! I know you have thing for her   too!&rdquo; </strong>I said hotly, somewhat feeling a little jealous knowing   she is lusting after Elila.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Oh well,   can&rsquo;t help myself right? You see Isa, I have what everybody wants   to have in a woman&hellip;so I guarantee you that I can get Elila in a week,&rdquo; </strong> said Lily boastfully, shrugging off at the same time. Ugh! She&rsquo;s such   a slut!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>She doesn&rsquo;t   want you,&rdquo;</strong> I growled slowly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>And you   think she wants you?&rdquo;</strong> Lily asked, raising her eyebrow. I couldn&rsquo;t   answer her and look away.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Okay   girls, break it up! What&rsquo;s going on with you and Elila?&rdquo;</strong> asked   Pamela curiously.</p>
<p align="justify">I take a deep   breath. This is not going to be good&hellip;even I&rsquo;m feeling a little moody   right now. <strong>&ldquo;We are friends again.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>WHAT?!&rdquo;</strong> asked Pamela and Cherry.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Hmm,   figures. Melvin is not good enough for you?&rdquo;</strong> asked Lily again,   enjoying me getting the &lsquo;torture&rsquo; right now. How I hate her.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Look!   Elila and I are just friends alright!&rdquo;</strong> I said irritatedly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>So where   are you going to put Melvin then? He&rsquo;s gorgeous!   &rdquo;</strong> asked Cherry, only thinking that we popular crowds need to date   gorgeous people. I rolled my eyes when I heard her pathetic answer.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Well,   he left me last night, I nearly got raped and Elila saved me and then   Melvin hurt me in my room last night and then Elila healed me again.   End of story! You can guess what a boyfriend he   is!&rdquo;</strong> I said coldly. But I could see the girls still wants me to   be with him.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Isa,   you mustn&rsquo;t think like that. Probably he is just protecting what is   his. Next thing you know, you and Melvin are inseparable!&rdquo;</strong> said   Cherry excitedly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Yeah!   About Elila, try not to be close to her&hellip;she&rsquo;s part animal&hellip;that&rsquo;s   really bad!&rdquo;</strong> said Pamela with a disapproving look.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>A good   thing for me. Not to worry Isa, just leave Elila to me,&rdquo;</strong> said   Lily evilly and the girls laughed. I gritted my teeth and just keep   quiet and look down miserably</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Elila&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I didn&rsquo;t   mean to hear their conversation with my heightened sensitive hearing&hellip;but   I couldn&rsquo;t help it. But after what I had heard from the girls, I wish   I didn&rsquo;t hear what they had said. So I&rsquo;m not worthy for Isabella   because I&rsquo;m part animal&hellip;too dangerous. And note to myself, stay   away from Lily!!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Elila,   your thoughts are really loud,&rdquo;</strong> said Tina, looking directly at   me.</p>
<p align="justify">I look at her   and mumbled <strong>&ldquo;Sorry&rdquo;,</strong> as she patted my back and comfort me,   telling me that it is not true and I must believe in myself. Hot tears   drop from my eyes as I quickly wipe it off before anybody could see   me. Tina smiles to me with sympathy as I just shrug it off; making it   like it&rsquo;s not a big deal. The silence between us was a soothing one   until the teacher comes in and everybody starts to take out their poetry   books to start the class. As Mrs. Sandra teaches, describing a poetry   that she just read earlier, I was calm and silent as her words drowns   in my ears. I always seem to find poetry a mystery. Whatever we read   and whatever we write, there&rsquo;s a story behind it. Well, if you write   a meaningful one that is. Whether you write about your life is like   hell&hellip;or describing your feelings towards an object or something that   is alive in this world, it seems to captivate me in wonder.</p>
<p align="justify">I have quite   a collection of poetry or literature books in my home. Most of them   are probably past down by my ancestors 100 years ago or more. There&rsquo;s   a library especially for these books and the new millennium books that   are quite meaningful to read. I always seem to go there since I was   a mere child, trying to read the poetry even though I didn&rsquo;t seem   to understand what it meant. Till now, most of them still make me wonder   why the poets wrote like that&hellip;and the hilarious part is, I find it   absolutely appealing.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>So, I   have finished reading the poetry that I have pick for the day and telling   you class what I think about it, so anyone wants to try to read theirs?&rdquo;</strong> asked Mrs. Sandra to the class before her. Groans could be heard in   the class as some pupils try to lower their heads on top of their desks   so they would not be called by the teacher to read in class. Tina is   as usual, reading one of her favourite poetry books that I can&rsquo;t seem   to recall as she calmly yet eagerly wait on as if the teacher is going   to call her up. I quickly glanced at Isabella and her group and wasn&rsquo;t   surprised to see most of them weren&rsquo;t holding a book at all. Lily   was yawning, showing clearly that she&rsquo;s bored to death as Cherry and   Pamela ended up gossiping. As for Isabella, well she&rsquo;s holding a book   alright but her expression shows that she&rsquo;s completely lost. Instead   of controlling myself, I giggled out loud, knowing fully well that Isabella   has simply no idea about literature. She told me years ago that she   finds literature an intense pain in the butt when she tries to understand   what was the poet trying to say and mostly thinks that every poet are   a psycho. And when I told her that some poets could be hopelessly romantic,   she thinks that I had fed my brain to the wolves <strong><em>&lsquo;metaphorically&rsquo;.</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Miss   Savage? I see that you found something quite amusing. Is there anything   you wish to share with the class?&rdquo;</strong> asked the teacher suddenly.   In an instance, all eyes were on me and realizing I got caught giggling   like an insane person, I mumbled an apology to Mrs. Sandra. Unfortunately   for me, she just raises her eyebrow and still wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to   be excuse that easily. Knowing that I have lost the <strong><em>&lsquo;battle&rsquo;</em></strong>,   I looked at Tina, showing that I was deeply sorry because I know she   just love giving her point of views in class. The common thing between   us, are that we both love reading literature as we find helping people   are important. But at the same time there is a difference between us&hellip;.is   that Tina loves to give her opinions to other people and she is not   afraid to do so. While me, well&hellip;I&rsquo;m just a silent one. Tina gives   me a slight scowl and just looks in front, eager for me to get the embarrassment   in class. <strong><em>&lsquo;Why me?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought helplessly as I sighed   and got up from my sit and gracefully walk to the front besides Mrs.   Sandra. She backs out a little to give me some space, as I slowly look   around the class&hellip;feeling a little uncomfortable&hellip;feeling like a prey.   Some of the pupils have this hungry looks on their faces, while some   are eager for me to read my poem, and the list goes on and on. <strong><em> &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s now or never,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought helplessly as I open   a book that I was holding and take a deep breath before I begin.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>The poem   that I pick for the day was written by John Keats. A great poet yet   he writes some complex poetry that so far I have read, but nevertheless   a great poet. I&rsquo;ll read one of his poems called <em>&lsquo;Ode to a Nightingale&rsquo;</em>,&rdquo;</strong> I said out loud, looking calmly   to the class in front of me. Then turning to the page that lays the   poetry that I wish to read, I begin softly.</p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;<strong><em>My   heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>My sense,   as though of hemlock I had drunk,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Or emptied   some dull opiate to the drains</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>One minute   past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Tis   not through envy of thy happy lot,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>But being   too happy in thine happiness, -</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>That thou,   light-winged Dryad of the trees,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>In some   melodious plot</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Of beechen   green, and shadows numberless,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Singest   of summer in full-throated ease.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Dance,   and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>O for   a beaker full of the warm South,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Full of   the true, the blushful Hippocrene,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>With beaded   bubbles winking at the brim,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And purple-stained   mouth;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>That I   might drink, and leave the world unseen,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And with   thee fade away into the forest dim:&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">As I read on   and on with a slight confidence in my voice, I let my eyes closed for   awhile, knowing fully well that I had memorize this poem by heart. It   was one of my favourites and I allow the invisible words that I just   said dance around my shoulders playfully, letting me feel as light as   ever. And, as I open my eyes to look at the class, I know that I hold   them captive with an interest on their expressions&hellip;or probably some   of them are just drooling over of my voice. But never mind about that,   what I have succeeded is that I got their attention. And I don&rsquo;t wish   to brag but&hellip;it&rsquo;s good to have the power of the voice sometimes.   Smiling to myself, I read on and on as the class was as quiet as the   flowing river, not knowing that I even got Isabella&rsquo;s attention as   well.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Hearing Elila   reading poetry for the first time is really quite intriguing for me.   I always knew Elila as the quiet one. When we have our chats, she&rsquo;s   always the quiet one. When we walk in the park in the early evening,   she&rsquo;s the silent one. I find it puzzling but she always said that   she prefers to be the listener and that&rsquo;s that. But that was a long   time ago. Her voice sounded so soft yet so haunting as if it&rsquo;s not   possible for a human to have such a voice. It brings goose bumps everywhere   on my body. I see the pupils around me absolutely mesmerized when she   reads on. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s because she&rsquo;s hauntingly beautiful,   or her voice that also holds a seductive tone that she doesn&rsquo;t even   know, or the poetry itself. For me, well&hellip;all the above! <strong><em>&lsquo;Oh   god&hellip;it&rsquo;s true!&rsquo;</em></strong> I groaned silently, finding myself being   seduced by the haunting voice of hers but I try to remain in control   at least.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Damn&hellip;she&rsquo;s   just getting me hot all over!&rdquo;</strong> I heard Lily whispered. I&rsquo;m not   sure if she&rsquo;s saying it to us or to herself but I could hear her moan   a few times as she looks dangerously at Elila. I swear she&rsquo;s going   to pounce on her if she doesn&rsquo;t control herself. I watch Lily touching   her neck and necklace absentmindedly as she watches Elila reading in   front. Even Elila had caught Lily in interest! Well&hellip;not in literature&hellip;but   some other things&hellip;Watching this, I felt a pang of jealously building   in me. I even felt like shaking Lily and saying<strong>,   &ldquo;Stay away from Elila!&rdquo;</strong>&hellip;but I couldn&rsquo;t. It will be all too   confusing for me.</p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Fade   far away, dissolve, and quite forget</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>What thou   among the leaves hast never known,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The weariness,   the fever, and the fret</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Here,   where men sit and hear each other groan;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Where   palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Where   youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Where   but to think is to be full of sorrow</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And leaden-eyed   despairs,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Where   Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Or new   Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Away!   Away! For I will fly to thee,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Not charioted   by Bacchus and his pards,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>But on   the viewless wings of Poesy,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Though   the dull brain perplexes and retards:</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Already   with thee! Tender is the night,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And haply   the Queen-Moon is on her throne;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Cluster&rsquo;d   around by all her starry Fays;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>But here   there is no light,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Save what   from heaven is with the breezes blown</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Through   verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Hearing Elila   still reading in front, I could see her closing her eyes and she looks   as calm as the sea and so vulnerable in front. Part of me wants to go   up and embrace her passionately, wanting her, touching her. And other   part of me keeps reminding me that I belong to someone else. This makes   me in depressed but I just watch her read passionately. Even with her   eyes closed, her right hand rises up and touches something invisible   in the mid-air, caressing an <strong><em>&lsquo;object&rsquo;</em></strong> with ultimate   gentleness. In an instance, I remembered her caressing me in the locker   room earlier this morning&hellip;it was full of tender and love and makes   me arches for her. But I shake my head guiltily as I look at her sadly<strong><em>.   &lsquo;Why is it that you have to choose me and not someone else?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought to myself. If she could only love another, I&rsquo;m sure that   person would be the happiest person on earth to be with her. But no,   it has to be me!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>I got   to hand it to her, for a half breed; she does have such a beautiful   expressive voice. I wonder how she screams in bed&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong> whispered   Lily suddenly near my ear. I stiffened a little, feeling the anger building   up inside me. How dare she think of my friend that way? I tried to say   something but no words seem to come out of my own mouth.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Think   she would be interested to have some <em>fun</em>&hellip;with me?&rdquo;</strong> whispered Lily slyly, probably knowing   well that I would be insane with jealousy but I tried to calm myself   down by taking a few deep breaths. <strong><em>&lsquo;Patience Isa&hellip;she&rsquo;s just   playing with you&hellip;God I hope!&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought to myself, also   finding myself a little panic with the thought of Elila and Lily together.</p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>I cannot   see what flowers are at my feet,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Nor what   soft incense hangs upon the boughs,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>But, in   embalmed darkness, guess each sweet</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Wherewith   the seasonable month endows</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The grass,   the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>White   hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Fast fading   violets cover&rsquo;d up in leaves;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>And mid-May&rsquo;s   eldest child,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The coming   musk-rose, full of dewy wine,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The murmurous   haunt of flies on summer eves.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Darkling   I listen; and, for many a time</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>I have   been half in love with easeful Death,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Call&rsquo;d   him soft names in many a mused rhyme,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>To take   into the air my quiet breath;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Now more   than ever seems it rich to die,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>To cease   upon the midnight with no pain,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>While   thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>In such   an ecstasy!</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Still   wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain   &ndash;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>To thy   high requiem become a sod.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Trying my best   to ignore Lily&rsquo;s distasteful remarks, I just observe Elila and her   reading. Her every movements as she read seems to be as graceful as   a swan&hellip;.oh no&hellip;more like a wolf or a leopard. And sometimes, as she   looks up to look at us pupils, her silver eyes holds somewhat a mysterious   tale there&hellip;.that makes you want to look deeper into her eyes and yearn   for the tale to envelop you. Then at that moment, I begin to realize   that she has grown so much since we last spoke to each other a year   ago. Is it because of her increasing power or gift that changed her?   Or is it something else? Me? Gosh, could it be me that changes her&hellip;?</p>
<p align="justify">Without having   much time to feel the guilt, Lily continued her crude questions. <strong> &ldquo;You know, a <em>&lsquo;piece&rsquo;</em> like that must not only be <em>with</em> one person, you know what I mean Isa? Seems quite&hellip;unnatural,&rdquo;</strong> she said with a hint of laughter.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Stop   it Lily! She&rsquo;s my friend!&rdquo;</strong> I growled back at her, trying hard   to control my temper.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Right.   So listen, since you said that you&rsquo;re not interested in her; want   to give her to me? I could probably learn a thing or two being with   a <em>wild</em> girl; and if you want her in the end, I could just toss   her to you&hellip;&rdquo; </strong>said Lily with a smirked on her face.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Damn   it! I said stop it! And she&rsquo;s not a PIECE ok?! So don&rsquo;t you dare   throw her around before you regret it!&rdquo;</strong> I snapped at her loudly   as a few pupils near me turned to look at me before returning their   gazes at Elila in front.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Whatever   you say Isa&hellip;.Whatever you say,&rdquo;</strong> chuckled Lily as she leans back   to continue watching lustfully at Elila. I sighed deeply knowing that   she&rsquo;s not taking my word for it. And knowing Lily well at least, she   tends to get what she wants. Gosh, I do hope Elila would protect herself   from her.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Elila&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Part of me   was relieved that here I am, standing in front of the class and telling   them what literature seems to enlighten me about; but also part of me,   being the silent one is thinking, <strong><em>&lsquo;A few more paragraphs to   go and I could sit down!&rsquo;</em></strong> Feeling a little bit timid somehow   yet still trying to compose myself in front of the pupils, pretending   that I&rsquo;m doing fine in reading out loud, I open my eyes and looked   at them as I try to put my feelings in the poem.</p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Thou   wast not born for death, immortal Bird!</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>No hungry   generations tread thee down;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The voice   I hear this passing night was heard</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>In ancient   days by emperor and clown:</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Perhaps   the self-same song that found a path</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Through   the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>She stood   in tears amid the alien corn;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>The same   time oft-times hath</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Charm&rsquo;d   magic casements, opening on the foam</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Of perilous   seas, in faery lands forlorn.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;<strong><em>Forlorn!   The very word is like a bell</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>To toll   me back from thee to my sole self!</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Adieu!   The fancy cannot cheat so well</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>As she   is fam&rsquo;d to do, deceiving elf.</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Adieu!   Adieu! Thy plaintive anthem fades</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Past the   near meadows, over the still stream,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Up the   hill-side; and now &lsquo;tis buried deep</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>In the   next valley-glades:</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Was it   a vision, or a waking dream?</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Fled is   that music: - Do I wake or sleep?&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Content that   I have finally finished reading the poem, I closed the book gently and   look at the pupils and give a slight bow to them. I hear them clapping   their hands and a few cheering, which is a little peculiar for me. Standing   up straight and now facing towards Mrs. Sandra, I just simply shrug   in a saying that I had finished reading &ndash; just like a typical teenager.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>That&rsquo;s   very good Ms. Savage. An interesting poem and why do you pick this particular   one?&rdquo;</strong> asked Mrs. Sandra with interest. I thought for awhile before   answering the question. Sometimes I don&rsquo;t have the right answer for   a particular subject, but in literature I believed that <strong><em>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s   no right or wrong answer for everything&rdquo;.</em></strong> So, I faced the   crowd again and take a few deep breaths to calm my bundle of nerves.   Hey, I did say that I&rsquo;m the silent one so I&rsquo;m so not used to this.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>I chose   this poem, which is probably written in the year 1819 and was critiqued   that it had the unique and perfection in style. I also chose this because   of its meaning. I think I could relate to our lives in different ways.   In this poem, the persona is feeling rather down and has the desire   to drown himself to a river of forgetfulness, probably longing for alcohol   or so. But there he sees and hears a nightingale singing melodiously   and he doesn&rsquo;t envy of it but rather feeling and sharing the happiness   completely. Later the poem goes on, saying that the persona is tired   of this human life because everything seems to be temporary and nothing   last for long and with that, he thought that he would surely forget   the nightingale because he&rsquo;s aware that everything doesn&rsquo;t last   for long. The persona even asked the nightingale that he would follow   it, not to alcohol but through the poetry which will give viewless wings.   And as he walks further and further in the night, he cannot see the   flowers that&rsquo;s on his feet but could guessed in the darkness and as   he listens to the nightingale, he somehow loves the idea of dying and   had called Death to take him away, but also realized that if he&rsquo;s   gone then he would not hear the nightingale sing anymore and also thought   that it is immortal and not meant to die.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I cleared my   throat a little and begin to give my opinions.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Now,   that&rsquo;s the brief summary of the poem. What makes me wonder as I read   this; it&rsquo;s because of what we do in our lives. We humans most times   have the sad feeling of not fitting in this world, and we choose to   drown ourselves in many wrong paths. We think that we feel happy in   that way, but what if it is a lie?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I looked down   at my hand as I simply let a light blue-purplish energy ball formed   in my palm. I looked at it absentmindedly as I hear the pupils gasped   in awe. Still looking at my hand, I continued what I was trying to say.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>A powerful   person could even fall in love with the idea of death because he thinks   that he lost all hopes when the goodness is gone from him. Even a clan,   who are gifted with tremendous powers, could fall to the darkness and   so will I and the others.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Saying that,   I sighed deeply and closed my eyes, also closing my hand as the energy   fades away.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>But as   long there is the light, the goodness to fight, someone you love, it   is worth to go through the darkness and we will face our fears. If we   give up and let Death take us away from earth, then somehow in an eternal   life, we would regret leaving someone or something unfinished in this   world as we would somehow not reach it anymore. We will be just a gas,   soft foam in the air.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   I shyly bowed a little to the pupils and walked to my sit. I distractedly   hear clapping from the background, but was too meek of knowing what   they are thinking about right now. I guess I have put my poem into a   political case somehow. Not that I adore politics&hellip;.I&rsquo;m so not into   that. But seeing my cousin, Tina raising her eyebrow at me, asking,<strong> &ldquo;Are you making this class a Literature class or a Peace Club?&rdquo; </strong> I just looked down embarrassed by her firm question as I just telepathically   said to her, <strong><em>&lsquo;Sorry, you know I&rsquo;m not used to this!&rsquo; </em></strong> and giving her my best puppy eyes that I could manage. And knowing Tina,   aside of her strict and punctual manners and sometimes a perfectionist,   she just takes a deep breath and shakes her head and smiled at me, as   she looks in front hearing what the teacher is saying.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Well,   very motivating point of view Miss Savage and thank you for sharing   with us. Now, who&rsquo;s&hellip;..&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>RIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNG!!!!</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Students are   starting to clear up, cheering for joy that the 3rd and 4th period are   over. Hmmmm, it seems that my poetry takes most of the period time!   As all the students are ignoring what Mrs. Sandra is saying in front   because too eager to go for lunch period, Tina and I got up and pack   up our stuff to leave too when I suddenly saw a piece of folded paper   at the edge of my desk. I looked around, finding who was the one who   left it there but the students were leaving the classroom already. I   also looked at Tina but she just shrugs it off, not knowing the answer.   Curious, I slowly pick up the paper and unfolded it to see what was   written in it. As I read the short message, I groaned and rolled my   eyes.</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Hey,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Free to   have fun with me? ;)</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Approach   me whenever whatever.</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Lily.</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">Okay, first   of all, EEWWWWWWWW and second of all&hellip;..well, EEWWWWWWW!!!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>What&rsquo;s   wrong Elila?&rdquo;</strong> asked my cousin worriedly as she must have heard   my <strong><em>&lsquo;Eww Ewww&rsquo; </em></strong>in my mind.</p>
<p align="justify">Annoyed, I   rip off the message and dump it in the rubbish bin. What does that girl   thinks I am? A gigolo? Oh wait, that&rsquo;s for guys right? Ermm&hellip;then   for a girl is&hellip;..okay, I&rsquo;m soooo not going there! I&rsquo;m soooo not   that!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Elila&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong> growled Tina, still waiting for my answer. Tiredly, I sighed deeply   and looked at her.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Tina,   what do you think of me and Lily together? As in&hellip;.REALLY TOGETHER?!&rdquo;</strong> I asked patiently.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Huh?   What? That&rsquo;s so disgusting! EWWWWWWWWW!!!!! I could tolerate Isabella,   but Lily? EWWWWWWW!! YUCK!&rdquo;</strong> cried Tina as if she wanted to run   to the ladies room and throw up badly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>My point   exactly,&rdquo;</strong> I muttered as we both leave the classroom and went to   meet our other members for lunch.</p>
<p align="justify">Aaahh&hellip;.lunchtime.   A sort of heaven for the students, away from classes. Hahahaha&hellip;..that&rsquo;s   a funny thought although the cafeteria&rsquo;s food is not that bad here.   My cousins and I are sitting outside the school&rsquo;s garden, enjoying   the soft breeze and the mid-afternoon sun. I ate some chocolate sandwich   and chatted with my other cousins as Lucas was at the side, gobbling   almost ten burgers down his stomach. Damn, can he really eat! But then   again, he did say that he is a growing boy. Oh well, that&rsquo;s Lucas.   Anyway, Tina starts telling them that I have succeeded in making &lsquo;<strong><em>Literature   into Peace</em></strong>.&rsquo; They ended up teasing me madly but I try to change   the topic by accidentally blurted out about the message that Lily sent   to me, well indirectly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>EWWWWWWWW!!!!&rdquo;</strong> said the girls in disgust.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Here!   Here,&rdquo;</strong> mumbled Tina with agreement, raising her right hand up.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Cousin   Lee! Don&rsquo;t you dare make a move that doesn&rsquo;t belong to us!&rdquo;</strong> scolded Leo as I understand what he&rsquo;s saying but rolled my eyes nevertheless.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Who?   Lily? Damn she&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</strong> said Lucas excitedly but my cousins looked   at him dangerously, making him feel more confused and ended up saying, <strong> &ldquo;What did I just said?&rdquo; </strong>Groaning loudly, they ignored him and   turned back to me as if waiting for me to defend myself.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>What?!   I&rsquo;m not going to go after Lily! Promise! I swear under the Protector&rsquo;s   honour!&rdquo;</strong> I whined a little as I raised my hand up to show that   I meant it.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Where&rsquo;s   your other honour?&rdquo;</strong> demanded Leo greatly. Gosh, he is very guarded   when it comes to <strong><em>&lsquo;mates&rsquo;</em></strong> issues. I sighed irritatedly   yet still trying to be patient with him.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Fine!   I swear with my body and soul under the Protector&rsquo;s Honour and Hunter&rsquo;s   honour that had been pledged to me! And also for my future mate&rsquo;s   honour when the time comes,&rdquo;</strong> I said firmly, dramatically got up   from the green grass and jump to the nearest bench and said it out loud   for the world to hear. After being serious for a minute, I couldn&rsquo;t   help but smile a little when I see my female cousins giggling uncontrollably   behind Leo&rsquo;s protective back as he looks sternly at me with his arms   folded in front of him. Still seeing that he&rsquo;s still guarded, I drop   the act and jump down from the bench and went to him.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Oh, come   on Leo. You know I wouldn&rsquo;t do that. How could you doubt me now?&rdquo;</strong> I asked him as I walk closer and closer towards him. His greenish-eyes   look harshly at me for a moment, but then slump his shoulders and take   a few deep breaths. As I was near his presence, I stop elegantly and   gently take his hands into mine.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>I need   you to be at my side Leo&hellip;.as in to be there for me if I&rsquo;m ever at   lost.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>I know,   I&rsquo;m sorry I doubted you. But I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll give in&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Because   Isabella belongs to someone else? Is that what are you afraid of?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Leo didn&rsquo;t   dare to answer my question but in his eyes holds the truth. Feeling   slightly hurt, I closed my eyes and squeezed his hands.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Then   help me to not fall for the wrong person&hellip;..help me to be stable if   I lost control&hellip;&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>But I&rsquo;m   more animal than you are&hellip;.&rdquo;</strong> reminded Leo hesitantly, I explored   his mind gently and found him surprisingly afraid that one day he would   fail me to do this task that I asked him.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>But I   have found my mate&hellip;.a mate than I couldn&rsquo;t have,&rdquo;</strong> I said slowly.   Again, Leo kept his answer to him knowing that it&rsquo;s useless to answer   me now.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Then   it&rsquo;s a vow between us,&rdquo;</strong> he said suddenly. I open my eyes and   see him smiling caringly at me.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Promise?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Not a   promise&hellip;.a must!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">And with that,   I laughed out loud and hug him tightly as he did the same. Finally being   able to come back to reality, we see Lucas being <strong><em>&lsquo;cornered&rsquo;</em></strong> by my female cousins, probably bullying him about something ridiculous   and we could hear him asking us for help but we ignored him as we both   sit down to finish our lunches. And just like that, things seem normal   again. The breeze welcomes us by giving us <strong><em>&lsquo;a performance&rsquo;</em></strong> by suddenly gathering all the fallen flowers and leaves from the trees   and makes these colourful Mother Nature&rsquo;s <strong><em>children</em></strong> danced   with a slur in the blue sky. For a normal human hearing, they wouldn&rsquo;t   be able to hear an unheard music in the breeze, but I could and so does   my cousin, Leo. Well, I&rsquo;m not sure about Lucas because I think he&rsquo;s   still immature to accept nature as one as us.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Hey,   it&rsquo;s that Isabella coming here?&rdquo;</strong> whispered Lucas to us as we   quickly turned around and saw Isabella from a distance, walking here!!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>You have   got to be kidding! Probably she wants to meet someone else!&rdquo;</strong> I   said in panicky, quickly looking at my food and find it as if interesting   to see.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Riiighhht!   We are the only ones here doofus!&rdquo;</strong> said Lucas, smirking at me.   And then he added, <strong>&ldquo;Looks like this mate is scared!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Shut   up Lucas!&rdquo; </strong>I growled dangerously as my eyes glowed a little at   him but the punk doesn&rsquo;t seem to be scared and laughs out loud with   the others.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>She&rsquo;s   coming closer,&rdquo;</strong> whispered Tara softly and I could see Leo nodded   his head, could probably feel another presence close to us. Oh God!   What am I going to do? What&rsquo;s going on with me? I&rsquo;m not supposed   to be afraid! Right, after the incident in the fitting room, it&rsquo;s   kind of hard to shut out the intimate moment between us<strong><em>.   &lsquo;Okay Elila, you have to breathe and act normal! Your cousins are   all here so you could go through this just fine!&rsquo; </em></strong> I thought to myself as I find the thought quite calming for me.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Hey bro!   Do you think we need to do something with something?&rdquo;</strong> Lucas suddenly   asked his brother quickly.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Huh?   What?&rdquo;</strong> I asked blankly. What the heck is he talking about?</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Oh yeah.   Right! But I need help from the girls too. ALL THE GIRLS! So what do   you girls say?&rdquo;</strong> asked Leo charmingly towards my female cousins.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>What&rsquo;s   going on?&rdquo;</strong> I demanded impatiently. But the next thing I hear are <strong> &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; </strong>and <strong>&ldquo;Be right with you&rdquo; </strong> and<strong> &ldquo;Certainly&rdquo; </strong>from the girls as they pack up their stuff   and lunches and followed the boys quickly, leaving me behind sitting   on the grass alone with my lunch. I was still dumbfounded yet still   manage to see Leo flashing a smile towards me and hearing Lucas saying, <strong> &ldquo;YOU GO GIRL!!&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Realizing quickly   what had just happened, I immediately cursed at their departure and   thought, <strong><em>&lsquo;ARGH! Cursed you all! How dare you leave me here in   this situation?!!! What makes you think I won&rsquo;t screw up?!! You&hellip;you&hellip;ARGH!   You all will pay for this! Yes! You all will&hellip;.&rsquo;</em></strong></p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Hey,&rdquo;</strong> said a soft voice above me, immediately cutting my cursed thoughts as   I quickly look up and saw Isabella standing there, holding her lunch.   I didn&rsquo;t seem to say anything at first but just stare at her gaze   steadily, slowly wanting to study what&rsquo;s behind those dark brown eyes   of hers. But would she allow me to go through?</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Hi Isa,&rdquo;</strong> I said brightly and I stop just there, too comfortable gazing at her   from where I sat. Some parts of me doesn&rsquo;t seem to be working at the   moment but some good parts of me like my hands to be exact, automatically   patted the grass beside me to gesture Isabella to sit down. Isabella   probably saw my hand and response a <strong>&ldquo;Thank You&rdquo;</strong> to me and   went to sit down on the soft grass, with a little distance between us   of course.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Have   you finish you lunch?&rdquo;</strong> asked Isabella, breaking the gaze game   of mine. I jerked a little and find myself suddenly a little shy again.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Not really,&rdquo;</strong> I said with a smile yet puzzled thinking why is she here. But as the   breeze taunted me by blowing a little of belle&rsquo;s hair to her face   lightly, making her look like an angel, I stop breathing for a second   and think that I don&rsquo;t mind her being here with me.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>I thought   I might spend time with you, if you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</strong> she asked gently   as if she had read my mind.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>No! I   mean&hellip;I don&rsquo;t mind at all,&rdquo;</strong> I said quickly and we both laughed   shyly and looking away from each other once in a while.</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Just   like old times?&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p align="justify">After hearing   that, my heart seems to cry out with joy and happiness. At last, my   friendship has been official renewed!</p>
<p align="justify">&ldquo;<strong>Yes little   belle, just like old times,&rdquo;</strong> I said with a smile as I take her   hand and squeeze it, saying that I&rsquo;m grateful for this to happen.   And after a few awkward questions and answers, we come to a stage where   we&rsquo;re able to talk and laugh together just like the old times. Ah,   it&rsquo;s such a wonderful feeling.</p>
