Uncontrolled Affection

Alyson stormed into the house and straight into her room where she 
slammed the door hard and turned up her little stereo so the sound of 
Tori Amos would drown out the sounds of her own sobs as she leapt onto 
the bed and cried into her pillow. 

&quot;That bitch!!!&quot; Alyson cried, &quot;How could I ever love you?&quot; She screamed 
curling up into a ball clenching the pillow tightly in her arms, &quot;I hate 
her! I hate her!&quot; She mumbled into the corner of the pillow, and then 
suddenly sat up and walked across the room. Upon her dresser she found a 
small-framed photo of Natalie. She picked up the photo and stared at it 
for a moment before dropping the photo, frame and all, into a near by 
waste paper basket. 

&quot;Is everything alright?&quot; A voice asked from behind the girl.

Alyson spun around to find her bother standing in her bedroom doorway, 
&quot;B...brother!?!&quot; She stammered, frantically wiping away her tears. 

&quot;I could not help to hear your music and figured that you must be 
stressed about something.&quot; Drake said as he entered the room and sat 
upon the girl&#39;s bed. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Alyson said, trying to put up a strong front. 

&quot;Would this have anything to do with that friend of yours?&quot; He asked 
with a sign of concern in his voice. 

Alyson nodded, &quot;That slut was just using me till she found her friend.&quot; 
She growled angrily, &quot;I caught her with that redhead at the dorms.&quot; 

&quot;Redhead?&quot; Drake stood to his feet, &quot;You found her then?&quot; He asked with 
more interest then before. 

Alyson looked at her brother curiously, &quot;Natalie found her a couple of 
days ago. She is now staying with her at the Academy.&quot; 

&quot;I see...&quot; Drake began to think deeply, &quot;This does make things 
intriguing.&quot; He muttered. 

&quot;Who is she?&quot; Alyson asked curiously, &quot;At first I didn&#39;t think she was 
anything special and then...&quot; She remembered the heat she felt from the 
girl&#39;s wounds, &quot;She is not normal.&quot; 

&quot;That she is not.&quot; Drake started out of the room, &quot;I have some research 
to do. I hope things turn out well with you and that friend of yours.&quot; 

&quot;Brother? Haven&#39;t you been listening?&quot; Alyson asked desperately. 

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later.&quot; Drake was already lost in his own thoughts as 
he left the room. 

Alyson blinked several time at her bedroom door. She could never really 
figure her brother out. He seemed so distant at times, always in search 
of something. She flopped onto her bed and stared at the ceiling. She 
felt more alone at that moment than she had ever felt before. Rolling on 
her side she looked down at the waste paper basket and the corner of the 
frame that stuck out of the scrap papers. She sat up and gazed into the 
basket. Carefully she pulled out the picture frame, a small crack had 
formed on the corner of the glass however the photo itself was all 
right. Alyson had a strange felling come over her as she stared at the 
photo. She glanced at the bed where the two of them had slept so many 
times and remembered how they used to curl up together. So innocently 
and yet she wanted more, just didn&#39;t know how to voice what was inside 
her mind for fear the girl would laugh at her. She felt so foolish, she 
was the one who pushed Natalie away when she should have been keeping 
the girl close to her side. 

Then fear crept into her heart as the memory of her brother&#39;s threats 
that very morning entered her mind and the way he squeezed her arm so 
violently, along with his sudden, and new, interest in Nat and Kim. The 
idea of losing Natalie for real entered her mind. What would her brother 
do if he found Natalie? Would he hurt her, or worse, kill her? Alyson&#39;s 
heart began to pick up pace as worries raced throughout her mind. She 
needed to do something. Losing Natalie to another girl was one thing; 
however losing her entirely was something she could not bear with. 

Attentively she peered out into the hall, from her room she could see 
her brother pulling on his cloak and head out the door. Double-quick 
Alyson ran back into her room, and flung open the closet, grabbed a 
duffle bag and tossed the photo into one of the side pockets, and then 
proceeded to grab whatever clothes she felt would be needed and pitched 
them into the bag as well. Pausing only for a moment when she noticed 
that the drawers Natalie used were bare. She didn&#39;t recall the girl 
returning for her things, yet pushed that to the back of her mind as she 
pulled out more of her own things and stuffed them haphazardly into the 
bag and zipped it shut. 

Afraid her brother might be still nearby, she dropped the bag next to 
the patio door, behind the sofa, before returning to the front door to 
obtain her leather jacket and her swords, a pair of Katanas that her 
brother gave her for her birthday years ago. She was in the midst of 
grabbing her winter jacket when the door opened and her brother entered. 
He stared down at the girl as she stumbled backwards, falling over the 
umbrella stand with swords, umbrellas and coat tumbling to the ground. 

&quot;Alyshione?&quot; He stared down at the girl as he entered the house. 

Alyson back-pedalled, grabbing one of her swords, &quot;B... brother...&quot; She 
stammered nervously. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Drake asked, glancing at the coat and swords, &quot;What 
were you doing in the closet?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Alyson tried to think quickly. Her eyes darted over to where her 
bag was hidden, to make sure that it was not visible, &quot;I... I was 
looking for Natalie&#39;s jacket.&quot; She blurted out, &quot;I&#39;m tossing out all of 
her things. You... just surprised me.&quot; 

&quot;I see...&quot; Her brother studied her curiously, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I forgot 
something in my office.&quot; He walked past the girl to his room. Alyson let 
out a deep sigh as she stood the umbrella stand back up and began to 
carefully replace the swords and umbrellas one at a time. Her brother 
came back into the room, &quot;I&#39;ll be back late so don&#39;t worry about 
dinner.&quot; He stated opening the door, then stopping for a moment and 
looked down at his sister, &quot;And don&#39;t let that girl worry you. She will 
not harm you any longer.&quot; He said with a look in his eyes that made 
Alyson shiver, and then he proceeded to exit the house, closing the door 
behind himself. 

Alyson flopped to the ground as she tried to control the shiver that 
overwhelmed her entire body. Something about the way he looked at her 
made her fear for her friend even more. She didn&#39;t know what he was 
implying, but she somehow knew it was not good. She quickly got to her 
feet, threw on her jacket and grabbed the swords, then ran to the sofa 
to retrieve the duffle bag, which she threw over her shoulder. 

Cautiously she pulled the curtains of the patio open enough for her to 
peer outside. She could see her brother walking along the opposite side 
of the street until he disappeared around a corner in the opposite 
direction of the academy. Alyson let herself breath a little easier when 
she saw this, At least she knew that she would not run into her brother 
on the way to the school. For the most part Drake stayed far away from 
the school, always claiming that something about the school gave him an 
unsettling feeling. Alyson hoped that this would mean that her friends 
were safe from her monstrous brother&#39;s intents. 

She waited a few moments to make sure that her brother had no intent on 
another surprise return, and then she slipped out of the house, across 
the backyard and out into the back alleys.
