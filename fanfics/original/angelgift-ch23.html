<a href="../original/angelgift-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>        Sharin strode down the corridor to the bridge, the
blonde pausing in the doorway a moment as she took in
all of the activity there. Commander Laurel and
Allison stood to one side, talking softly. Amara and a
technitian were working over the tactical station, the
young man pointing out some of the quirks in the
weapons system. The navigation station was still open
but the various other positions around the bridge were
all occupied.

       &quot;A Galactic Patrol cruiser on aproach vector,&quot; Ensign
Kayla Shen reported, the pink haired woman monitoring
communications.

       &quot;Looks like they got it repaired faster than
expected,&quot; Amara muttered, running a hand through her
short black hair.

       In the main viewscreen the slim black vessel smoothly
settled into orbit not far from where the cruiser
Liberty&#39;s Sword waited. &quot;Or else they kept Marilyn
from slowing things down too much,&quot; a grinning Sharin
commented.

       &quot;We&#39;re being hailed,&quot; Kayla said, &quot;I&#39;m putting them
through.&quot;

       The image of the patrol vessel appeared and Milly and
Roma gazed out at them, a few engineers still at work
behind them. &quot;Reporting for duty,&quot; Roma said calmly,
&quot;we are hearby putting out vessel under your command,
Captain Tennison.&quot;

       &quot;I accept your assistance,&quot; Allison said after a bit
of quiet prompting from Lauren, &quot;dock with the
Liberty&#39;s Sword while we complete repairs.&quot;

       &quot;Looks like Allison is getting used to command,&quot;
Sharin noted quietly, completely unaware of the
presence coming up behind her.

       &quot;Sharin!&quot; Milly happily pounced on her from behind,
the redheaded catgirl sending her sprawling to the
deck.

       &quot;Do you have to do that?!&quot; Sharin roared from
underneath her.

       &quot;Yes,&quot; Milly bounced to her feet.

       Sharin got up, brushing her street clothes off.
&quot;Stupid question,&quot; she muttered, fighting back a smile
as Milly looked around curiously.

       &quot;Where&#39;s the princess?&quot; Milly asked, her tail lashing
behind her.

       &quot;Setting up the captain&#39;s quarters,&quot; Allison answered
her with a faint blush as she studied a display,
&quot;we&#39;ll be sharing them.&quot; She looked up towards Sharin
andf casually said, &quot;According to your file you have a
shiphandling certificate and reserve military rank?&quot;

       &quot;You want me on navigation?&quot; Sharin raised an
eyebrow.

       &quot;If you&#39;re willing,&quot; Allison nodded, &quot;you&#39;d be an
asset.&quot;

       A slight smile tugged on Sharin&#39;s lips, &quot;With a
compliment like that, how can I say no? Do I get
reactivated in the Fleet?&quot;

       &quot;Probably for the best,&quot; Allison agreed. She looked
over at her second in command, &quot;Lauren, do you want to
handle it?&quot;

       &quot;Right,&quot; Lauren nodded, the slim blue haired woman
walking over to Sharin&#39;s side.

       As the Commander was swearing Sharin in Milly looked
over at Allison, &quot;I&#39;ll go see if the princess needs
anything.&quot;

       &quot;Thanks,&quot; Allison grinned, her sandy brown hair
falling into her eyes.

       &#39;I can see why Jenna likes her,&#39; Milly thought as she
slipped away from the bridge. She exchanged nods as
she took the short walk to the captain&#39;s quarters and
rang the chime.

       Jenna looked up from where she was frowning at a
piece of art hung at the wall and brightened
noticably. &quot;Milly,&quot; she beamed, &quot;what are we going to
do about this place?&quot;

       &quot;It&#39;s not exactly fitting accomidations for a Royal,&quot;
Milly agreed, looking around the room with cat-like
curiously.

       The suite was two large rooms, a large living room
that also had a table for meals, couch and a few other
pieces of furnature. A few paintings of maritime
vessels from ancient days hung up on the walls, the
few decorations giving the place a masculine feel. The
bedroom beyond was unadorned, only a large bed with a
few other fixtures.

       Jenna nodded slightly, &quot;Still, we should be able to
make it more comfortable with things from the suite.&quot;
She smiled slightly, &quot;Did you and Sharin run into any
problems?&quot;

       &quot;Paying the manager in gold helped head off any
arguments from the manager about us leaving so
quickly,&quot; Milly smirked. She hesitated a moment then
asked a question she had meant to ask for days, &quot;Are
you sure you&#39;re ready to face your mother?&quot;

       &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Jenna admitted as she sat down on the
couch with a sigh. &quot;I know that she&#39;s going to be
upset with me and I have no idea how she&#39;s going to
react to Allison.&quot; She brightened, &quot;Though I do think
her sending this ship out here for us is a good sign.&quot;

       Milly perched on the arm of the couch, smiling
slightly as she said, &quot;The Queen might surprise you,
at least as far as Allison goes.&quot;

       &quot;Oh?&quot; Jenna looked up at her.

       Milly cautioned her, &quot;It&#39;s just a palace rumor but I
heard that Queen Jen&#39;ai has more than a...
friendly relationship with her servant X&#39;tahn.&quot;

       &quot;X&#39;tahn?&quot; Jenna blinked in surprise, thinking of the
white furred catgirl whom was the closest confidant to
her Mother. She nodded thoughtfully, thinking of the
occassional glances, the intimacy that existed between
them. &quot;I&#39;m surprised they could keep it a secret so
well,&quot; she added softly.

       &quot;Most of the servants know,&quot; Milly admitted, &quot;they
tend to notice when someone doesn&#39;t return to their
room at night.&quot; She flashed a smile, &quot;But most of us
are so loyal to her majesty that we&#39;d never reveal
such a secret.&quot;

       Jenna nodded thoughtfully, &quot;Then I&#39;m glad for them.&quot;

                               &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;

       Lieutenant Alex Keron stood at attention by the
hatch, the black haired young man smiling as
the airlock quickly cycled open. &quot;Welcome aboard,
ma&#39;ams,&quot; he said to the Patrol officers.

       &quot;Thank you,&quot; Roma said, the silvery skinned android
nodding to him respectfully. She smiled, &quot;Could you
please escort Marilyn to the bridge?&quot;

       &quot;Please?&quot; Marilym beamed. A bit sheepishly she added,
&quot;I don&#39;t really know my way around this class of ship
yet.&quot;

       &quot;Sure,&quot; Alex felt himself blushing slightly. He
looked over at Roma, the android crisp in her uniform
and asked, &quot;Do you need assistance?&quot;

       &quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Roma murmured, watching with a smile
as they headed off. She moved from the dock into the
corridors of the ship, having already commited the
standard layout to her memory. In minutes she found
herself at the medical bay, opening the door with a
gesture.

       Kat was reading a screen on the Medical equipment in
the facility, frowning in thought. She looked up and
grinned, &quot;Roma!&quot;

       &quot;How are you settling in?&quot; Roma asked, hesitantly
entering the room.

       Kat got up and walked over, the black military
uniform fitting her like a glove as her brown braid
bumped against her back. &quot;I grabbed a few essentials
from my apartment,&quot; she said with a little shrug, &quot;and
I&#39;m good to go.&quot;

       &quot;I&#39;m glad that you decided to come along,&quot; Roma said
quietly.

       Kat looked at Roma thoughtfully, a little smile on
her face. &quot;There was something I wanted to ask you
about,&quot; she said, &quot;I have a shy friend who I think
likes me.&quot;

       &quot;Yes?&quot; Roma asked nervously.

       &quot;She and I hang out all the time,&quot; Kat continued,
&quot;and I think she&#39;d like us to be more than friends.
Any advice?&quot;

       &quot;Maybe she should take a step forward,&quot; Roma said,
mustering up all her courage, &quot;and tell you about how
she feels.&quot;

       &quot;And?&quot; Kat asked with a little smile.

       Roma closed the distance between them, &quot;I think I&#39;m
falling in love with you.&quot;</pre>
