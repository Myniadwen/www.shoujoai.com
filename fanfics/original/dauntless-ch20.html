<p>“She’s a Pirate: the colossal  space battle!”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s finished,”  Kayleigh Acheron said as she pulled the headset away. “Even for  Herut, that was quick. It’s amazing how fast she can really work.”</p>
<p>“The <em>Dauntless</em> is just a  tough ship,” her sister argued. “Even after everything we and  those pirates put it through, it came out all right. But that’s  not our concern, Dr. Miracle. This ship cannot survive another fight  like that. It’s fast and it’s got a tough hide, but that’s all  there is to it. If we’re going to keep getting into dangerous  situations, we <em>need</em> weapons.” Amy stared at the twins  blankly, her weight shifted heavily on her left foot as always.  Whatever physical pain she was going through was trivial compared to  the moral problem she was facing. Her ship—her family’s ship had  always been designed for peaceful exploration and the pursuit of  truth and wisdom. Amy might have been a bit easier to fool than the  rest of the crew, but she wasn’t naïve: she understood that there  were just some people out there who were not interested in playing  nice.</p>
<p>“I had hoped to ask Rachel to  help us in that matter,” she murmured, teetering slightly. “However, her policy is to never get involved unless the other  party is incapable of helping themselves. Therefore, I didn’t  really want to rely too much on her. I think it would be wise to arm  ourselves for these encounters, but the <em>Dauntless</em> will fight  prudently and honorably—and we must not use the weapons unless we  have no other choice. Please realize that I’m only agreeing to  this so that everyone here will be protected. If we were to ram  somebody,” she muttered with a sad smile, “it would be  very…inconvenient.”</p>
<p>“It’s settled,” Teleah  stated. “We’ll dock at the first civilized planet and search  around. Since Vimmy’s the most experienced with merchants and  bargaining, we’ll let her handle the negotiations. You should  probably go with her, doctor, to make sure the little troll doesn’t  go overboard.”</p>
<p>“We also seem to have quite a few  women handy with tools,” Kayleigh murmured. “We could save a lot  on labor. I almost hate to ask Herut to chip in again…”</p>
<p>“She won’t mind,” Amy  replied. “Herut was made that way. It’d be like asking Chandra  to seduce two women in a row.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a certain excitable  inventor pricked her ears and perked up. They wiggled and darted  like little pixies on the verge of creating a new prank, and she sat  up, filled with a sudden strange energy, as her senses flared,  indicating it would soon be time for her to work her magic.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oooh, there’s a delicious  disturbance in the air!” she sang giddily. “I’ve got the  feeling that somebody’s going to need me in a big way! That means  I’ll get to work with LOTS of fire! Hey, d’ya think I’ll get  to weld something?! I hope so!” Kyrie’s devilish grin  disappeared suddenly as her lover rose out of bed sluggishly and  started getting dressed. It was as if she didn’t even hear her! “Wha? Hey, Val, what’s up? You tired of me already?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that,” Valti said  as she wove her superfluous limbs through her custom-made shirt. She  was only halfway finished before she paused, her back facing the  fiery Pyrosian. “Kyrie, I think we should…break up. I know this  is cruel of me right now… We just had sex and it’s the worst  possible time for me to say this, but it feels like we’re not  really right for each other. I mean, we’ve got a lot in common,  but it’s like… Uh, I’m not quite sure how to explain it. It  just doesn’t seem to click. Look, you’re a good friend and all,  and I enjoyed…sneaking around and having fun. We can still do  that, I mean, it’s just…”</p>
<p>“Aha!” Kyrie exclaimed,  snapping her fingers. “So you <em>are</em> tired of me!”</p>
<p>“No, I…well, jeez, I don’t  know how else to put it. We’re not right for each other.” Kyrie  took a moment to seriously process this, curling her hair absently as  she always did when she was stumped. Okay, so Valti really was a  good friend, and they certainly had a lot of fun together, especially  in the lab and garage. They had made love a few times, and it was  nice, but…well, now that Kyrie thought about it, it really <em>didn’t</em> seem right. She loved Valti, but could she honestly bring herself to  really <em>commit</em> to that deep level of devotion? No. Valti was  a friend, and while it did feel a little painful, it wasn’t fair  stringing her along like this.</p>
<p>“No biggie,” Kyrie resolved,  smiling faintly. “I get’cha. We’re just friends who…had sex  once in awhile. That’s all. I guess I’m not really right for  you, am I?”</p>
<p>“You sound disappointed,” Valti  sighed. Kyrie grinned and hopped out of bed; she dressed so quickly  that for a moment, it looked like the room itself was on fire.</p>
<p>“Well, I am gonna miss all the  freaky sex, but it’s cool. Don’t you feel too bad about it,  okay? I gave it a bit of thought and I have to agree. But let’s  not be shy around each other, okay? I…couldn’t stand it if we  couldn’t hang out.”</p>
<p>“Sure.” She jiggled all six of  Valti’s hands before running off to the cockpit, presumably to  check up on that feeling. Valti’s face turned scarlet as she  noticed an article of clothing Kyrie forgot, and picked it up with a  restrained giggle. “You forgot your pants, Miss Lastgear!”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>It was difficult landing on a  civilized planet with a half-dozen wanted women onboard—or rather  it might have been, if the <em>Dauntless</em> didn’t have so many  revered celebrities on the ship. While the twins were explaining to  Vimmy what their plan was, she decided to take control of  communications and weaseled the ship’s way into port, promising air  and space traffic control a few extra bucks for looking the other  way. As obnoxious as she was, they had to admit that Vimmy was very  useful, but they also knew that usefulness was conditional. She  promised to pay for the weapons as well but expected equal  compensation for her sacrifice.</p>
<p>“I’m not pretending I’ll see  any monetary profit out of this, of course,” she said as the crew  left the ship and stretched their legs, “I simply mean that the  entire crew owes me a debt, and it’s only fair they repay me  however they can, or else I can’t be expected to help out anymore,  just ask Sharyn and Mink, they’ll tell you I’m not a charity, now  please leave me to my business and oh my, are you coming with me, Dr.  Miracle, because I would like your company, I’ve really been  meaning to speak with you, get to know you better, see what sorts of  assets you…well, all that sort of thing, yes, don’t pay any mind  to my babbling, all that glitters may not be gold but not all gold is  bullion, I believe, but what a drab sense of fashion you have!”</p>
<p>“Look at them go,” Kyrie sighed  as she watched Vimmy waddling, Amy hobbling, and Mink gracefully  gliding beside them both. They made an unusual team and a strange  sight, but as long as nobody minded and Vimmy didn’t let her mouth  run <em>too</em> wild… “Well, guess we’d better get to work too,  huh ladies?” She grinned hotly at her small work force, which had  increased since word got out that the ship was being outfitted for  weapons. Along with Herut (who didn’t mind being put to work, as  Amy had predicted) and Kyrie (who insisted on all the welding), Eve  and Rebecca were recruited to work as well, for obvious reasons. They  were still a little shy around the gregarious Kyrie, but luckily  Herut was there to tip the scales towards a more mature area.</p>
<p>“Regardless of what Miss Fonester  buys, we’re going to have to redesign these areas,” she said,  pointing to the ship’s blueprints. Herut went into deep detail  about the intricacies of altering a ship’s exterior and interior to  allow weapons integration, including what new systems had to be added  and what they’d be forced to remove. The job would be quite  difficult since the <em>Dauntless</em> had never been laden with  artillery before; most vessels merely required a weapon “transplant”  or upgrade, since they already had most of the necessary systems  installed, such as cooling ducts and ammo storage. Fortunately,  Vimmy and Mink both had a loose understanding of these designs, the  former being accustomed to buying and selling weapons, so there was  no need to worry about missing anything. And as unconventional as  the mechanics themselves were, they were all really brilliant when it  came to their work, and they followed Herut’s design like lovers  follow poetry.</p>
<p>Once  Vimmy, Mink, and Amy came back  with the weapons (they had to be delivered on trucks and pallets),  the crew went right to work, and most everyone else chose to help out  rather than rest. Shana proved to be a quick study and was soon  acting as the chief gofer girl whenever anybody needed something. Mink  knew a little about machinery as well, and set herself up as a  relief engineer whenever </p>
<p>somebody needed to take a break. Kate handled all the heavy lifting, Chandra made lunches (though she  was distracted far too often by the sweaty, glistening bodies of  women at work), Naja took over as supervisor (she managed to impress  people with her competence, but was a little too strict), Allegra set  up the ammunition rounds, Aseria and Lil provided protection (just in  case someone wanted to slip through and disturb their work), and of  course, Fuuka was there in case a thumb was crushed or a toe was  stubbed.</p>
<p>Every two hours, all the chief  mechanics took a fifteen-minute break to rest, refresh themselves,  get some exercise, and take in the sights. Rebecca desperately  wanted to join Riene for lunch, but she was still uncertain of  herself—and lately her eyes had been drifting towards Lyara, who  made no attempt to mask her own “studies”. Herut was content to  work, but sometimes she went on a walk with Eve or Shana; Kasberry  herself drifted here and there aimlessly, more focused on blanking  her mind and relieving her muscles. It felt good to really  concentrate on a big project like this, and outside complications was  the last thing she wanted to deal with. She decided to sit down at a  restaurant, far away from Chandra’s watchful eye, and ordered a  milkshake. She had only taken a few relaxing sips when a haunting,  beautiful, familiar person joined her.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you had a sweet  tooth.” Eve paused in mid-bite to look up. It was the Jackal,  grinning craftily, more radiant than before now that she was no  longer covered by cloak or hat. She sat down quietly and stared at  Eve dreamily. “Did you know that you’re the answer to a wish? Now all I need is a straw…unless you’d rather be alone.” Eve  was too dumbfounded to ask any questions, and emptily pointed to a  concessions booth.</p>
<p>“There’s…some over there.”</p>
<p>“Oh, right! I’ll be back!” The Jackal quickly grabbed her straw and planted it into the  milkshake, sipping slowly. The front of her blouse was open,  revealing her silky skin prickling in the breeze. The woman wasn’t  wearing anything underneath it. “Now my wish is complete,” she  murmured peacefully. “So now we’ll answer that question we both  have. I’m here on business and pleasure—nothing criminal, of  course. Not yet, anyway. I <em>only</em> just arrived. And you?”</p>
<p>“Repairs,” she replied stiffly. The Jackal’s face stretched into a crescent smile and she reached  out for Eve’s hand. It felt cold from grasping the shake.</p>
<p>“You seem distant. Did I do  anything to upset you?”</p>
<p>“No,” Eve murmured hoarsely. “I just didn’t expect to see you here.”</p>
<p>“Well, what are the odds of  anybody meeting anybody these days? Since we’ve already had two  encounters before, I’d say there must be more to our meetings than  chance, Miss Kasberry. Was it destiny? Did God intend for us to be  together? If so, are we meant to be enemies or lovers…or both?”</p>
<p>“Please don’t ask me,” she  whispered softly—yes, soft and helpless, so unlike the Eve that put  on a cold, stony face in front of the others. This woman was so  charming and arresting that she drew out that hidden side of Eve she  kept buried and forgotten—that childish, pure innocence made out of  </p>
<p>absolute goodness, hope, and  fear—the Eve that, more than anything, desired love and  companionship. More than once she had fantasized about making love  to this mysterious person. “I’m not ready to decide. You’re  a…very unfamiliar part of my life now.”</p>
<p>“I’m not as complicated as all  that,” said the Jackal, leaning in to kiss Eve. She didn’t  resist, but she didn’t return the favor; she sat stationary and  calculated the spontaneity of such an intimate act. This was the  sort of thing real lovers did after they had been with someone for  years. They’re not shy about little displays of affection during  intermittent hours of the day, and they don’t have to have a reason  behind them either. Eve finally returned the kiss after staring at  the older woman for a few minutes, and slipped her tongue inside as  easily and gently as breathing.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured,  shirking back defensively. “I shouldn’t stay here much longer. The…repairs need to be done and…I’m part of the crew. Y-you’ve  got a schedule as well, I suppose, so you should… Anyway, you can  have the rest of my shake. I’m really not that fond of sweet  foods. So long.”</p>
<p>“And may we meet again,  regardless of the forces that may see to it,” Jackal answered  joyously. She chuckled sweetly, raised the cold glass in a salute,  and crossed her legs. Her voice called out to Eve one more time that  day: “Be careful of pirates, now. I’d stay far away from any  encounters if I were you. Thanks for the treat!” When Eve was out  of sight, the Jackal put the dessert down and fished her phone out of  her purse. She began to work her magic and nonchalantly altered the  fates and lives of countless people, all with the push of a button.</p>
<p>“Captain Chuunaru, this is the  Jackal. …Don’t be rude; I’m only here to help. Tell your  Admiral I know where the <em>Bloody Dove</em> will be, and if he wants  that information, I’d be happy to speak to him personally. Also,  unless I’m mistaken, I know the exact whereabouts of several wanted  criminals. …Now that’s not information I can tell <em>you</em>,  Chuunaru, is it? Although I do believe I have found your stray  mechanic. …Don’t be silly now, my dear Captain. You <em>know</em> of whom I speak.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Rose  had taken over the wheel from  Patches so that the scantily-clad woman could rest. Being infamous  pirates occasionally had disadvantages, such as whenever they had to  make port to buy more ammunition. There were few worlds these days  that openly welcomed pirates, and they were never savory places to  visit, and only the most desperate stayed longer than they had to.  Rose’s crew drew a lot of attention, of course—she only allowed  women to run her ship, and naturally a large number of them were easy  on the eyes—but she wasn’t shy about brandishing sword or  shotgun, and some in her </p>
<p>crew looked like they could bite the  horns off a rhino. They were safe and well-supplied now, though, and  were finally ready to visit New London, a world in the Alpha Centauri  system.</p>
<p>“Look lively, pussy-bangers,”  she announced to her crew. “Soon we’ll be wealthier than the  entire Norgrin race put together. Maybe then we’ll start searching  for that Nail our dear Elshyrin friend wanted so badly. You think I  should just hand it over, or make her work for it?”</p>
<p>“That’s an easy question,”  Henrietta answered as she mopped the deck. “You’ll make her  fight for it, bargain it for sex, steal something while she’s  asleep, and then go and seduce that two-headed woman. And after all <em>that</em>, you’ll take the Nail back just to piss her off.” Rose laughed out loud and winked.</p>
<p>“Am I becoming so predictable?”</p>
<p>“It’s happened before,”  Henrietta sighed.</p>
<p>“That’s what she did to me  before I came onboard!” Duchess exclaimed. Rose frowned with mock  guilt.</p>
<p>“No hard feelings, I hope.” Duchess smiled wickedly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t get mad, I got  creative. I got you back, right?”</p>
<p>“That you did,” she grinned  warmly. Rose resumed focus on the path ahead of her and noticed an  injured ship limping in the distance. She activated the long-range  sensors and found out it was leaking fuel and oxygen. A crafty smile  unfolded on her face as she noticed it was registered as the <em>Wily  Way</em>, another vessel she had sworn vengeance on.</p>
<p>“Captain!” Duchess exclaimed;  Rose waved at her casually.</p>
<p>“I know, I see it. O how the  venomous serpent grins as she slithers toward her wounded foe! Keep  your distance, though; they could be bluffing. Fire a warning shot  and see if they’re willing to beg for their lives.” Henrietta  scrambled to the cannons and let loose a mild barrage; in response,  the <em>Wily Way</em> fired back and initiated a sluggish retreat. Rose couldn’t help but chuckle darkly.</p>
<p>“Brave and stupid to the bitter  end. That’s what you get for fucking with a pansy, I guess. What  a waste of good looks. Continue firing and increase pursuit. I’m  gonna run that skinny-ass bastard right over!”</p>
<p>“The <em>Dove</em> is gaining,”  Torch called out. Patty and Natalie exchanged a puzzled glance.</p>
<p>“I guess the Captain really is in  the habit of sleeping with her enemies.”</p>
<p>“And just about everybody else in  between.” Rose slapped her sword against the wall sharply,  breaking them away from their gossip.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Less chatter and more splatter,  ladies! If I catch you muttering again, I’ll force you to wear <em>dresses</em>.” Patty and Natalie moved as fast as their outfits  allowed, or what little was left of them, anyway. Let it never be  said the Dead Rose enforced any dress code aboard her ship.</p>
<p>After a few volcanic moments where  the <em>Dove</em> assaulted the helpless <em>Wily Way</em>, the pirates  finally caught up and prepared to board. Fighting the stubborn ship  made their greed and bloodlust stronger still, and they had given up  their pirate’s cunning for passion. But perhaps even the Captain’s  guile could not penetrate through this clever trap: the wounded ship  fighting for its life had successfully drawn its prey close, and bit  down hard against her hull as an explosion ripped the <em>Wily Way</em> apart. Great huge spheres of fire and debris were flung everywhere,  punching holes in the <em>Bloody Dove</em> and setting it ablaze. There was cursing, chaos, and screaming everywhere as Rose recovered  from the blast and demanded to know what was going on.</p>
<p>“It must’ve been jury-rigged  and set to go off if we came too close!” Torch announced, yelling  at the top of her lungs. “That was a trap and we ran right into  it! I still can’t determine if there were people onboard or if it  was all done by remote. Doesn’t look like it matters, though!”</p>
<p>“Shit,” Rose grumbled, “that  was low. If they wanna come after me, why don’t the feckless  bastards do it in the open? Even pirates follow a code! Is anybody  killed down there? If you can move, you can help those that can’t!”</p>
<p>“Captain, the ship’s sustained  heavy damage, but we’re still alive. Not in any condition to  really fly or fight, though.”</p>
<p>“Captain, I’ve got several  girls wounded over here. No deaths so far!”</p>
<p>“Good, take them to the infirmary  and put out those fires when you’re done! Hopefully our good  doctors aren’t in any mood to seduce their patients this time.”</p>
<p>“Captain, I’m picking up an  approaching ship on the radar. I can’t see any registration yet… Hold on! It’s the military! The timing can’t be a coincidence,  Rose: this was <em>their</em> doing!”</p>
<p>“God damn it!” Rose roared,  smashing her fist on the controls, shattering a plating of glass. “How in the nine Hells did they figure out where we were?”</p>
<p>“We were sold out, more than  likely,” Duchess said softly. Rose turned ashen and dark; her eyes  narrowed and a flame seemed to spew forth from their depths.</p>
<p>“If there’s a rat here, I swear  I’ll rip off her skin and nail her to the mainmast. In the  meantime, we’ll send a nice little gift basket to our friends. Now  which military sweetheart is after me today?” As if in response,  the ship’s radio blared to life, and a strong, stern voice sprang  out like thunder.</p>
<p>“<em>Attention, </em>Bloody Dove<em>! This is United Cosmic Military Captain Kaori Chuunaru of the </em>Neo  Yamato<em>, requesting you stand down before further damage is done to  your ship. We are under no obligation to </em></p>
<p><em>exercise any restraint, so if you  value your health and your lives, you will come along peacefully—and  hopefully, fully dressed.</em>”</p>
<p>“You hear that?” Patty said as  she elbowed Natalie. “We’re famous!”</p>
<p>“Ladies,  I’ve got gowns in my  closet that are just your size!” Rose bellowed. Patty and Natalie  quickly shut their mouths and let the Captain finish negotiations. “So  the famous Captain Chuunaru was assigned to bring me in, huh? If your  body’s as sexy as your voice, I just <em>might</em> come  along peacefully. What I do once I’m in ‘custody’ is another  matter!”</p>
<p>“<em>Your sophomoric flirtations  won’t save you this time around, Rose. I wouldn’t touch you even  to beat your face in. This is your final warning, ‘Captain’. I  won’t hesitate to turn your ship into a cemetery.</em>” Rose took  a careful breath and considered her options. If the military hadn’t  sprung that dirty trick on her, she could’ve easily roused the ship  and turned the tables. The <em>Dove</em> might not have been equipped  with the finest military weapons, or staffed by an experienced crew  of hardened veterans, but it was one of the meanest, proudest, most  savage ships around, and could easily sail circles around those  sluggish military vessels. The <em>Dove</em> still had most of its  ammunition left, and a good majority of her crew was still healthy  enough to fight—but the ship itself was crippled and bleeding. So,  would she forfeit her life and the lives of her treasured crew to  that military bitch, or would they all go down in a blaze of glory?</p>
<p>“As if there’s a choice,” she  murmured serenely. Rose put her lips to the radio and made kissing  sounds, then belched as loud as she could and screamed to her crew: “ATTACK!”</p>
<p>“<em>You’ve chosen well,</em>”  Chuunaru purred maliciously. “<em>May the sound of screams be your  funeral dirge, pirate filth. </em>Neo Yamato, <em>clean up this  trash.</em>” A barrage of lasers surged through the darkness of  space to envelop the wounded <em>Dove</em>, and Rose braced herself for  her climactic finale. It was a good thing she kept her eyes open,  though—otherwise she would have missed seeing those lasers bounce  off the hull of an intercepting vessel as it came between her crew  and certain doom.</p>
<p>“Those morons,” she murmured  softly, fighting a smile. She was definitely in love with that pilot  now. “<em>Dauntless,</em> I’d ask what the hell you’re doing,  but I’m too damn grateful right now. I’d really like to know why  you’re here.”</p>
<p>“Shit, it’s that crazy pirate  lady! Hey, two-headed freak! You led us right to your fucking  girlfriend!”</p>
<p>“This was completely  unintentional, Naja. Or maybe the UCM corralled us this way.”</p>
<p>“You both realize the radio’s  still on! Naja, turn that blasted thing off!”</p>
<p>“No way, bitch! Um…bitches. I  gotta give that rum-swilling pig a piece of my mind! Just what the  hell kind of carnival is this, Dead Rose?”</p>
<p>“I gather the military’s after  you too,” she said, chuckling quietly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“<em>Excellent timing, Captain  Rover!</em>” Chuunaru exclaimed, apparently having forgotten her own  transmission was still running. “<em>Now we can kill two birds with  one stone. Leave the </em>Bloody Dove <em>out of this for awhile; they  can’t fight back anyway. …What do you mean, my radio’s still  on? Um…oh, shi—</em>“</p>
<p>Click. Rose snickered.</p>
<p>“Patches, see if you can’t steer  this wreck out and join the battle. Peggy—“</p>
<p>“My name’s Henrietta! How many  times do I have to tell you?”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she giggled. “Empty  as many shells as you can while we make our way over to the <em>Neo  Yamato</em>. We might be wounded, but we’re sure as hell not  helpless. Hey, <em>Dauntless!</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Dauntless</em> here,” said  the Acheron sisters (Naja had apparently been restrained).</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me you’re gonna  try and ram both these ships!”</p>
<p>“No, we were just recently  outfitted with weapons. The military chased us away once they  realized how many big bounties we have onboard.”</p>
<p>“So it’s a gallery of rogues,  eh?” Rose smiled to herself; this was getting better all the time. “All right, so we’re all involved in this now! Just don’t  hold it against us if we can’t keep up right now! We’ll try  boarding the <em>Neo Yamato</em>, so we’ll need you to cover us.”</p>
<p>“Copy that. They’re focused on  us anyway. Good luck, Captain.”</p>
<p>“You too, beautiful.” Rose had  a feeling both twins were rather red right now. She ordered Patty to  speed up and ignore the ship’s condition: by hook or crook, she  was going to show the United Military what the Dead Roses were really  capable of!</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Dr. Miracle may have owned the <em>Dauntless</em>, but Naja and Yenae were its commanders, and they  whipped the disorganized and disoriented crew into shape so quickly,  the military ships were taken aback. One minute they were in pursuit  of a ragtag group of felons, and the next, they were fighting for  their lives against a ferocious opponent! Captain Rove might have  been overwhelmed and unprepared for this sudden shift, but Kaori  Chuunaru observed with a hawk’s steely determination. She was as  calm and deadly as a glacier, and watched the two ships slug it out  for a few moments before engaging her crew.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“This is an unusual turn of  events, but if we perform well, we can turn this in our favor. The <em>Dauntless</em> is to be spared and its crew is to be kept prisoner,  so we’ll wear her down and make her waste what little ammo she has. Oh,  look! They’ve definitely got a great pilot on their side. But…well,  that’s impressive. Whoever put those weapons together  certainly knew what they were doing! Our source wasn’t lying: repair  and maintenance Unit 18273645 and Engineer Kasberry are  definitely onboard.”</p>
<p>“Ma’am, the <em>Bloody Dove</em> is slowly advancing on our bow dorsal side. I’m picking up a  massive wave of firepower.”</p>
<p>“She  knows she’s beaten; that’s  why she’s hitting us with everything she has so early in the fight.  Raise shields and veer fifty degrees starboard, then move into  attack position and return fire. If we can take out her cannons,  she’ll be as helpless as a caterpillar.”</p>
<p>“Copy that.” The <em>Neo Yamato</em> still shuddered as several blasts struck it, but the shields held and  the ship moved away safely. It struck back, but a second salvo  intercepted and blew the missiles clear away. Chuunaru showed no  signs of disappointment.</p>
<p>“Fire second volley.”</p>
<p>“Second volley firing!” The  entire galaxy shimmered and glowed with fireworks, and was then  silent.</p>
<p>“She won’t last much longer at  this rate. What’s the status of the <em>Dauntless</em>?”</p>
<p>“Current readout registers its  weapons at forty percent. The <em>Carapace</em> is severely damaged,  but it’s putting up a great fight. Thank goodness they’re  keeping the <em>Dauntless</em> busy.”</p>
<p>“Send fighters out to assist  them. Concentrate on taking out the <em>Dove’s</em> ammunition  first. We’ll have plenty in reserve to blow her away and capture  the <em>Dauntless</em>. This battle is as good as over.”</p>
<p>“Yes, ma’am.” Kaori sat back  in her chair and folded her fingers. Ridding the universe of the  blasphemous Dead Roses was an accomplishment in itself, but now they  were going to bag half a dozen wanted women as well! She smiled  craftily to herself as she imagined what sort of accolade she’d get  from this campaign. “Major Chuunaru” sounded nice…but “Colonel  Chuunaru” was even better.</p>
<p><em>Hell, I might even make Admiral…</em></p>
<p>Too bad her fantasy was  interrupted. “Captain, we’re receiving a message from the <em>Dauntless</em>! It…it’s being broadcast everywhere! The <em>Bloody Dove</em> and the <em>Carapace</em> are receiving it as well!”</p>
<p>“What? What could they possibly  have to say now?” An image suddenly glared to life on their  monitor, and soon every vessel in the area—pirate, military, and  independent—could see and hear the announcement. A thin, mousy,  brown-haired woman with pigtails and glasses was clinging to the  mainmast of the <em>Bloody Dove</em>, her hair sweeping in the breeze  as she stood proudly above her audience. Those who knew Amy were  amazed to find she was standing firmly on both feet, without her  cane, but </p>
<p>she showed no signs of pain as she  stared deep into the eyes of all who looked upon her. Even Kaori  Chuunaru got the chills.</p>
<p>“Proud pirates of the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>,” she announced boldly, “and valiant adventurers of the <em>Dauntless</em>, here we stand facing insurmountable odds as our  enemies close in—the very hounds of Hell who want to devour us and  take us captive! My name is Amy Blithe Miracle, and I have come  aboard the <em>Bloody Dove</em> as an emissary of hope to our  beleaguered sisters and friends! Having worked alongside such an  admirable crew for many weeks now, and having fought against these  stouthearted warriors, I have complete faith that not only will we  continue to fight for the virtues we love, the virtues that keep us  alive and define us as living creatures, but we shall also be  victorious, and our enemies will tremble evermore at the mere mention  of our names!! Let the love of freedom in all our hearts strike back  now, and force our enemies to come to terms with our might! TALLY  HO!!”</p>
<p>Then, to everybody’s surprise,  Miracle actually swung down on a rope, yelling at the top of her  lungs, cutting a cable that had been set up before by Rose’s  pirates. As it snapped, every cannon sounded off and the full fury  of the <em>Bloody Dove</em> was unleashed in that instant, pummeling  the <em>Neo Yamato</em> with every last shard and shrapnel. Chuunaru  struggled to keep her ship alive; the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> laughed even as their mouths hung open.</p>
<p>“Somebody’s been watching too  many Errol Flynn movies,” Fuuka giggled.</p>
<p>“I’ve got the feeling she’s  always wanted to do that,” Riene added. The <em>Dauntless</em> quickly launched its own massive attack against the <em>Carapace</em>—and  soon both ships were freed to focus their wrath against the stunned <em>Neo Yamato</em>. Kaori Chuunaru’s stomach turned cold, and could  actually feel that promotion slipping through her fingers as her doom  closed in.</p>
<p>“Retreat for now,” she ordered  numbly, trying to compose her posture and her dignity. “We’ll  report this incident to headquarters. I will take full  responsibility for our defeat. Any word from the <em>Carapace</em>?”</p>
<p>“They’re worse off than we are,  but they say they’ll manage. It looks like our enemies are willing  to let us go.” She felt her shoulders slump and her muscles  loosen. How insulting—a pirate extending a hand of mercy!</p>
<p>“<em>What was that you were saying  earlier, beautiful?</em>” Rose’s voice called out. “<em>As I  recall, you weren’t under any obligation to exercise restraint. Does this mean we’re better than y—</em>“</p>
<p>Click. Kaori glared flaming  daggers at anyone that so much as whispered.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>In a matter of hours, the <em>Dauntless</em> had returned to the planet where she received her weapons upgrade—but  now the <em>Bloody Dove</em> was with her, undergoing repairs. Captain  Rose Gillian and her salty crew of female pirates stared humbly at  their beaten and bent vessel, glad they had survived yet stricken  that they were not only grounded, but in the debt of others. Dr.  Miracle was being a great sport about it—who would’ve guessed  that the legendary entity would turn out to be an ordinary woman?—and  made sure nobody rubbed it in. In fact, she was nothing but kind and  generous, and kept asking if there was anything her crew could do to  help, barring a massive lesbian orgy (which several people  considered, no doubt). Rose blushed and turned her down: saving  their lives and fixing her precious <em>Dove</em> was help enough.</p>
<p>“Don’t draw me any deeper in  your debt, now,” she warned cattily. An idea came to her as she  watched Miracle’s crew interacting with her own, and she subtly  pulled a tattered scroll from inside her coat. “Actually, I may  have a way to repay your kindness. Have you ever heard of the  Panther’s Tomb?”</p>
<p>“No,” Amy said. Rebecca was  far away at the time, working hard on the <em>Dove’s</em> weaponry,  but even at that distance, surrounded by loud noises, she picked up  the conversation as easily as if it were broadcast all over the  world. A shiver of dreadful excitement crawled up her body, and she  quickly scurried over to catch the rest of what they were saying. She <em>definitely</em> knew about the Panther’s Tomb—there wasn’t  a soul on her home world that didn’t.</p>
<p>“To put a long story short,”  Rose said, “it’s one of those legendary places nobody’s ever  found but nearly everyone’s heard of. You know about Shangri-La,  El Dorado, Xanadu, Avalon…places like that, right? The Panther’s  Tomb is exactly the same. People say there’s enough treasure there  to buy a whole star system with change to spare, but it’s supposed  to be impossible to make it through. It’s the dream of every  treasure hunter, pirate, outlaw, and all the other punks out looking  to make a name for themselves, and up until now, nobody could say  whether or not it really existed. This is a stupid question, but you  remember when my crew attacked the <em>Majestic Hand</em>, right? That  was partially out of pirate revenge, but we also heard rumors that  they had the only existing copy of the map that led to the Tomb. If  you’ll swear to me we’re even, I’ll give you the map. Hell,  I’ll even come along with you.”</p>
<p>It was difficult to tell what was  going through Amy’s mind most of the time. Her face was usually  peaceful, full of love, and shining with pleasant secrets and a bit  of naïveté. Rebecca couldn’t see if from her perspective, but  even if it were right in front of her, it would be impossible to  read. Dr. Miracle was judging this turn of events very carefully.</p>
<p>“It sounds fun!” she exclaimed  suddenly, her face lighting up with childish glee. “I was hoping  we’d get a chance to make friends with your crew, and I think an  adventure for everyone is in store. I just hope we don’t meet any  danger we can’t handle.” Rose grinned confidently.</p>
<p>“After what I saw today, that’s  very unlikely.”</p>
<p>Rebecca felt her heart leap  anxiously as the two women shook hands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I hope you know what you’re  getting yourselves into,” she murmured.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter:</u></em></p>
<p>Athena: Wait, we’re going where?</p>
<p>Kate: The Panther’s Tomb. I  don’t know where it is, but Amy seems certain. The strange thing  is that we’re teaming up with those pirates to find it!</p>
<p>Riene: I guess we really clicked in  that battle!</p>
<p>Athena: Yeah. Hey, if this place  turns out to be real, and half as dangerous as I’ve heard, some of  you should probably stay behind so you don’t slow us down.</p>
<p>Riene: You mean your sweet  Fuji-san, right?</p>
<p>Athena: No, I mean you.</p>
<p>Riene: Hey…</p>
<p>Kate: Seriously, though, how bad  can it be? We’ve got a genie on our side!</p>
<p>Riene: I don’t know… These  ancient places always seem to have special barriers protecting them. I guess we should worry about getting there first!</p>
<p>Athena: Stay tuned for “Tomb of  the Panther: a pirate raid!” Um, Fuu-chan, you know those pirates  are trying to seduce you, right? They don’t care about your anime.</p>
<p>Kate: I don’t mind being seduced…</p>
