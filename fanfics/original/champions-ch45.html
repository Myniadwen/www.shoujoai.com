When Sally Rosa Redinger finally gained consciousness, she was surprised 
to find two things.  One, not only was her leg restored, but there were 
no scars, nor any stains of blood on her boots.  Whatever that guy in 
white did to her, he did it better than any surgeon could&#39;ve.  She 
didn&#39;t even feel pain, nor dizziness, which was actually pretty peculiar 
considering the amount of blood she must&#39;ve lost.  But she figured, why 
try and complain about something good?  A little wiggle of her toes told 
her that her leg worked just fine.  The second thing that surprised her 
was the shy presence of Sarah Neuss.  Sally took a deep breath, 
wondering why she had this girl, of all people, as a visitor.

&quot;...To what do I owe this visit?&quot; she asked calmly.  Sarah was bashful, 
hanging her head and wringing her hands, still probably uncomfortable in 
front of the older woman.  She barely squeaked&#151;&quot;Th...thanks.&quot;

&quot;That is...I want to...thank you...for saving Joyce yesterday.&quot;  Sally 
blinked until she got the meaning behind Sarah&#39;s words.  That&#39;s right, 
she had saved Joyce, but...yesterday?

&quot;Was I...out for a day?&quot;

&quot;For awhile, yes.  Everyone was really worried, especially Miss Weathers 
and Mr. McCray.  I think they were both crying.  Joyce was beside 
herself, and she looked really pale.  I...guess the whole ordeal took a 
lot out of her.&quot;  Sally sighed, and though she didn&#39;t feel tired, she 
rested her head back on the pillow.  She couldn&#39;t blame the girl, not 
after everything that had happened.  To catalogue it again would only 
make her sick.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry I&#39;m no better use to you,&quot; she managed, to which Sarah 
snapped angrily.

&quot;Don&#39;t you say that!  Look...I&#39;ve been a jerk, okay?  S-so I was mad at 
you, b-but...I had every reason to.  My brother...was really my whole 
world.  I didn&#39;t have anything else, except him and Kari.  
So...naturally, I was angry.  But...&quot;  Sarah then started to cry, and 
reached out to hold Sally&#39;s sapphire hand.  She whispered, &quot;You&#39;re not a 
bad person.  You&#39;ve been good to both Joyce and me, and to everyone 
here.  I can...tell...you didn&#39;t do...all that...because you&#39;re a mean 
person; you did it...to save others.  I just wish I knew what was going 
through Akio&#39;s head when he agreed to work for those people.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m sure he had your best interests at heart,&quot; Sally murmured.  
Sarah sniffled.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry,&quot; she wailed.  &quot;Saving Joyce like that, and getting 
hurt...  I&#39;m really sorry.  Please, you don&#39;t have to serve me anymore.  
Just...saving her life was good enough.  I&#39;m really grateful for that, I 
really am.  She means...so much to me...&quot;  Sally found herself hugging 
Sarah, letting the poor girl cry on her shoulder.  She had not 
experienced a bad childhood, and except for her recent injury&#151;which 
proved now to be cured&#151;her life had been pretty good in general.  She 
could not fathom how opposite situations would affect anyone, least of 
all a girl as young as Sarah Neuss.

&quot;I...forgive you,&quot; she managed.  Sarah pulled back and smiled.

&quot;Thanks.  So, feeling better?&quot;

&quot;Yes, actually.  What happened?&quot;

&quot;Mr. White did his magic&#151;that&#39;s what happened!!&quot;  Sally looked up and 
beamed as she saw her girlfriend (who had spoken) and Stevenson come 
through the door, a bouquet in their arms.  Merry got first dibs and 
kissed Sally sweetly while Steve ruffled Sarah&#39;s hair, giving it the 
tiniest of jolts so it stood on end (she giggled and flattened it down 
again).  After she thanked them for their gifts, Sally was filled in on 
everything she had missed, including the secret Kamaguchi had revealed.  
When it was all over, the blue in her skin seemed unnatural.

&quot;I&#39;m going to be sick,&quot; she moaned.  Merry laughed and ruffled her 
girlfriend&#39;s hair, then gave her another kiss.

&quot;No sweat, it&#39;s behind us, or most of us.  We&#39;re just glad you&#39;re on the 
mend.  Now Mr. White has you in his debt.  How he hooked that leg of 
yours back up is a mystery.  I&#39;m guessing the guy has strange powers.&quot;

&quot;No kidding.  So...does he still not know about you-know-who?&quot;  Merry 
turned grave, knowing exactly who Sally referred to.

&quot;Actually, no.  Somehow that girl is keeping her identity very secret.  
I thought that guy knew everything, but it looks like even his 
clairvoyance is not perfect.  So much the better, from what Amielle 
tells us.&quot;

&quot;You feel like you could eat something?&quot; Steve offered.  Sally smiled 
warmly.

&quot;Gosh, I&#39;m hungry enough to eat a table.  What&#39;s for breakfast?&quot;

&quot;Uh, lunch, actually.  You were out for awhile, but who could blame you?  
Merry and I both nearly fainted after seeing your leg cut off like 
that.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s not make her even more sick before she eats, Steve,&quot; muttered 
Merry playfully.

&quot;I&#39;m just saying we were both worried.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but I wasn&#39;t the one barfing in the bathroom.&quot;

&quot;Because you were too paralyzed with fear.  You looked white as a sheet 
and wouldn&#39;t talk to anybody!&quot;

&quot;Hey, my girlfriend got hurt!  It&#39;s not every day you see the woman you 
love mutilated.&quot;

&quot;GUYS!!!&quot;  Merry and Steve stopped, looked at each other, and turned 
red.  Whoops.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; they sang.  &quot;We&#39;ll get you some lunch right away.&quot;  The two of 
them left Sarah in her care, who didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or gag at 
their antics.

......

The match that would &quot;settle the differences&quot; between Rin and Setsuka 
was just as it had been in the tournament, only with no judges and honor 
as the only rule.  By that moment in their relationship, it could be 
said that they were pretty even:  Rin had fairly beaten Setsuka once, 
had tied her in their next match, and was now indebted to her twice, 
although she did technically repay one debt by helping the older woman 
reunite with her daughter.  It was agreed between the two warriors that 
this then would be the final deciding match, winner take all, and 
anything that happened between them after this would be based on 
friendly sparring.

&quot;I, the Ronin Rin Takamatsu, am hereby ready to challenge lady Setsuka 
&#145;Snowblood&#39; Hinomoto to a contest of fair combat, in which the victor 
shall be known forever as the superior warrior.&quot;

&quot;And I, the lady Snowblood, Setsuka Hinomoto, swear to battle my worthy 
adversary, the Ronin Rin Takamatsu, until a victor is claimed.  May this 
honorable duel settle everything between us forevermore!&quot;  The two bowed 
in respect, drew their weapons, and smiled.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rin, &quot;now that we&#39;ve dismissed with the formalities, let&#39;s 
get down to business, shall we?&quot;

&quot;After you, my friend.&quot;  Friend.  Now there was a word Rin never thought 
she&#39;d associate with Snowblood&#151;but sure enough, she had been an 
excellent friend ever since the day they met, even during those 
confusing times when she still worked for the Crimson Blades.  Rin held 
her ground and waited, but knew Snowblood well enough to know that the 
woman would never attack first.  It would be up to her.

&quot;No quarter!&quot; she screamed, charging after her rival and friend.  
Setsuka happily met the challenge and their wills clashed for one final 
round.  Rin was still clearly the strongest of the two, but Setsuka had 
psychic powers to aide her, and a body slightly more adept to 
flexibility, not to mention a year&#39;s advantage in terms of age and 
experience.  They fought to their heart&#39;s content, not needing to adhere 
to rules or overseers, knowing that there were no judges, no villains, 
and no daughters at stake&#151;just a good clean honorable fight, the way 
those things were meant to be done.

There were no witnesses to their friendly struggle save for the birds, 
so there was no point in chronicling their duel.  The warriors simply 
fought as warriors and friends did, giving it all they had and not 
holding a thing back.  Snowblood fought Rin like she had fought Kali; 
the Ronin fought Setsuka like she had fought Sashuo.  They wounded each 
other, spilling blood and breaking flesh, hurling and punching and 
kicking and slashing and everything else, but these were blows of love 
and respect, not enmity.

&quot;You&#39;ve...improved...drastically,&quot; said Snowblood, her breathing coming 
out harshly.  Rin wasn&#39;t breathing so hard, but she had plenty of scars 
and bruises to worry about.  Still, she grinned.

&quot;Well, ya know, being dead does give you a better understanding of your 
powers.&quot;

&quot;And yet you understand so little of my own.&quot;  Takamatsu soon understood 
what her friend meant:  before she knew it, Snowblood had performed a 
technique so secret and deadly, it froze her in place just to look at 
it.  She rubbed her eyes&#151;yes, there was no mistaking it!  There were 
eight Snowbloods right in front of her!

&quot;The hell!!!&quot;

&quot;This is my ultimate attack!  Mugen no kensin, senko jin!  The blade art 
that offers illusion.  Which is the real me, Rin, and which is false?  I 
must warn you, all of these copies can put up a fight.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a load of bull&#151;&quot;  Rin was suddenly knocked down by one of the 
Snowblood clones, but when she turned to strike, she just swiped through 
empty air.  &quot;The hell!&quot;  Two others ganged up on her, bringing their 
swords down; Rin had to struggle to avoid being split in two.  She 
pushed them back, but now every Snowblood copy was after her, 
suffocating her with their ghostly bodies!  The wild Ronin screamed in 
pain and frustration, and swung wildly at anything that moved, all the 
while being mocked by her rival&#39;s laughter.

&quot;If you can&#39;t even hit the real me, then why bother moving around like 
that?  You must look like a tree blowing in the wind.&quot;

&quot;Shuddup!&quot; she roared.  Rin decided to close her eyes, to see if 
thinking like her rival would do any good, and once she got her 
bearings, she did seem to get a slightly better &quot;feel&quot; of things.  The 
Snowblood copies were only echoes of the real woman, so she followed the 
least-hollow voice to the real person and thrust herself forward with 
all her might.  The feel of her connecting to skin and bone was quite 
satisfying.

Even though Rin tagged the real Setsuka, the fight lasted another hour, 
until both opponents literally wore each other out.  There was no way 
they could go on&#151;they were drained, and could barely lift their weapons, 
much less stand.  When they hoisted their bloody, dirty heads and looked 
at each other, they shared a great smile of respect, and started to 
laugh.

&quot;Again we are even!&quot; exclaimed Setsuka.  &quot;It seems we&#39;re forever to be 
equals, then.  I am glad, though, that this was the outcome of our 
fight.&quot;

&quot;Waitaminute, what about all that &#145;fight to the finish&#39; crap we talked 
about?&quot;

&quot;Do you really want to continue fighting?&quot; asked Snowblood, smiling 
warmly.  Rin fought to contain her chuckle.

&quot;No, absolutely not.  Don&#39;t wanna...ruin our relationship with some 
silly grudge.  I&#39;m willing to say we&#39;re even if you are.&quot;

&quot;Agreed.&quot;  The two limped over and shook on it, and then, to Rin&#39;s 
surprise, Snowblood drew her in for a hug.  &quot;I thank you again, my 
friend.  You&#39;ve made me very happy.  I only pray my daughter grows up 
adhering to such honor.&quot;

&quot;...Let&#39;s not turn me into a saint, now,&quot; said Rin humbly.  &quot;I&#39;m just 
glad you&#39;re both okay and everything&#39;s...well, not normal, but pretty 
fair going.&quot;

&quot;Indeed...&quot;  Rin smiled&#151;but soon screamed as she felt &quot;somebody&quot; reach 
down and squeeze her rear end.  Her face turned very red very quick, and 
needless to say, she proved who could win in a verbal screaming match.

&quot;YOU TWISTED PERVERTED SAMISEN-PLAYING...BLIND WOMAN!!  WHAT ARE YOU, 
SOME KINDA WEIRDO?!?!&quot;

Setsuka just laughed and followed Rin back inside the building once she 
calmed down.  If her eyes were functioning, she most certainly would&#39;ve 
been gazing at the round, wiggling shape of Rin&#39;s bottom all the way 
there.

.........

Soma didn&#39;t know where the man in white was taking her, but anywhere was 
better than staying with all the other &quot;freaks&quot;.  She didn&#39;t know why 
she felt so sick when she gazed upon him for the first time&#151;perhaps 
because his hidden powers were so fantastic, they seized up her immune 
system and threw it for a loop&#151;but she was clearly over it, since she 
was following him&#151;but where?

&quot;I have a special place I would like to take you,&quot; he said, wandering 
ahead of her.  Soma noticed that he was no longer hiding the fact that 
his feet did not touch the ground:  Mr. White was literally hovering 
above the earth.  Soma might&#39;ve been sick again if she weren&#39;t so 
curious about their destination.

&quot;And where is this &#145;special place&#39;?&quot;

&quot;It is an apartment located in the city.  Two of my servants live there 
together.  I think it would be a benefit to speak with them.&quot;

&quot;Oh?  Why?  They anything like me?&quot;

&quot;In a sense, all living beings are like every other living being.  Even 
you and I have things in common, Soma von Zomren.  However, if you are 
wondering whether they are specially gifted, the answer is yes.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ve just wasted my time,&quot; she stated, stopping right then and 
there.  The man in white paused as well, turned, and focused his eerie 
smile on her.

&quot;Oh no, not in the least.  As I said before, it will be a benefit to 
you.&quot;

&quot;How?  You know I hate those people.&quot;

&quot;I do indeed.  But these are, shall I say, monsters you could identify 
with.  Give them a chance.  Perhaps you will understand them better once 
you get to know them.&quot;

&quot;...Unlikely,&quot; she scoffed.  &quot;...But if there are only two of them, I 
could deal with it.  Better than living in a place clogged with em&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Good.  Well, this way.&quot;

&quot;Hold on; you&#39;ve obviously got powers, so why not just zip us there with 
teleportation or...whatever?&quot;

&quot;Because it is a nice day.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bullshit me, you...whatever the hell you are.&quot;  Mr. White stopped 
again, turned around completely, and gazed at Pandora with such power 
that it made her wish she could vomit.

&quot;I am more than you can imagine.  I am as beyond the whole lot of gifted 
individuals as they are beyond you.  Do not put me into the same 
category as them, is that quite understood?&quot;  Pandora could only shiver, 
so he just kept his smile and continued walking.  Eventually she snapped 
out of it, hugged herself from fear, then knelt down suddenly and began 
to retch.

Mr. White didn&#39;t seem like the type to knock, but he did, and the door 
was opened by an average-looking girl (in terms of those with freakish 
abilities; she was really quite beautiful).  She was slightly petite and 
light, had mannish brown hair and eyes as deep and penetrating and blue 
as the sky.  She had on a beautiful purple sundress and performed a 
curtsey before removing a pale-blue glove, so Mr. White could take her 
naked hand and kiss it.

&quot;Hello, Namie,&quot; he said fondly.  &quot;It is good to see you in such 
excellent spirits.  May I introduce Soma von Zomren, who I have asked to 
come here and speak with you and Shalis.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a pleasure,&quot; said Namie, curtseying again.  Soma just snorted.

&quot;This one of the two freaks?&quot;

&quot;Mind your tongue,&quot; muttered the man in white bitterly.  &quot;This lady here 
is a jewel, a person who deserves the love and respect of many.  Come 
inside, will you, and mind your manners.  I did not bring you here to 
insult my servants.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I&#39;m used to it,&quot; Namie sighed.

&quot;Shalis!  We have company!&quot;  Nobody answered, so Namie asked her guests 
to sit down and make themselves comfortable.  While she went to get her 
roommate, Soma couldn&#39;t help but ask who these two girls were, what 
powers they had, and why she had been asked to talk to them.

&quot;The one we met is Namie Ayako Chizuka, a nineteen year-old lady who I 
am well-acquainted with.  She was born with the unfortunate curse of 
involuntarily secreting acidic fluids from her skin.  I took her into my 
care and promised to give her a better life in exchange for her 
services.  As you can see, I have already held up much of my bargain.&quot;

&quot;Acid secretion?&quot;  Soma made a face and shuddered.  &quot;How the hell does 
she walk around without corroding everything, including her clothes?&quot;

&quot;With the help of a special acid-resistant bodysuit designed 
specifically for her.&quot;

&quot;So how come you could touch her?&quot;  He looked over and smiled, but this 
grin was sharp, like the fangs of a serpent.  That seemed to be his 
answer; he changed the subject.

&quot;The other is Shalis Torth, a twenty-four year-old woman who I am also 
acquainted with.  She is the one I hope you will befriend.  She was born 
a normal woman, just as you were.&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s not a freak?&quot;

&quot;She is...gifted right now.  Unlike most others who bear special powers, 
she was not born with it, but rather, infused with it.  Have you ever 
heard of a company called Enteragon?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, from the doc.&quot;  Soma suddenly sat up as she realized where she 
had heard that name before.  &quot;Oh yeah, now I remember!  Yohko told me 
about that.  She was involved with this human restoration project.  
Something about Enteragon wanting to advance its research and using one 
of their employees to experiment on.  That&#39;s her?&quot;

&quot;It is the same woman,&quot; he answered.  Soma shuddered again, feeling 
sicker than before.  Oh yes, Yohko had entrusted her with that devilish 
secret, and she had felt ill the first time she heard it as well.  She 
couldn&#39;t imagine what life would be like for a woman who had been normal 
one day, mostly dead the next, and revived as part-machine another day.  
If it had been her, she would&#39;ve killed herself.

&quot;I was right,&quot; said he, noticing her grimace.  &quot;My decision to bring you 
here was well-founded.  Ah, and it seems both our guests have arrived.&quot;  
He and Soma stood&#151;though it had been strange to see Mr. White seated at 
all&#151;and greeted the two guests.  Pandora couldn&#39;t help but stare at 
Shalis, a woman made ugly by science and technology.  Her throat had a 
scar, as did her eyes, and her arms were totally gone.  A generator was 
bolted to her shoulder and collarbone, and energy generators stood as 
substitutes for her lost limbs.  She had green hair, but this was the 
least of the surprises.

&quot;I apologize for Soma&#39;s reaction,&quot; said Mr. White, nodding to Shalis.  
&quot;It seems even she is capable of being shocked.  This woman has seen her 
fair share of surprises lately, have you not?&quot;

&quot;...Sorry,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I just...heard about you, is all, and I...&quot;

&quot;You pity me?&quot;  Shalis snorted, and with Namie&#39;s help, sat down.  &quot;I 
suppose it&#39;s my lot in life to be pitied.  Strange, too, that you know 
more about us than we know about you.  Just why did you bring her here, 
sir?&quot;

&quot;So she could get a better understanding of people with your skills&#151;and 
your curses.&quot;

&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got both in spades.  What do you want to know?&quot;

.........

The one thing Pandora the Gambler had not wagered on was an 
understanding and empathy of Shalis and Namie.  During their discourse, 
she was told horror story after horror story, where both women suffered 
countless days because of their affliction.  Most people gifted with 
powers cherished them, or abused them, but either way they saw to it 
that other people were miserable.  Namie and Shalis detested who they 
were, what they had been given and even how they were using it.  Namie 
could never know the feel of a lover, and Shalis teetered on the 
boundary between woman and robot.  Their tales made Soma change her 
perspective on the superhuman gene and those who bore it&#151;but only a 
little.

She especially sympathized with Shalis, one who had been made a monster 
by a company&#39;s thirst for advancement.  Her emotions ragged, her 
humanity nearly lost, Shalis existed a half-life, and until she had been 
rescued by Mr. White (and later, by Namie), all she cared for was work, 
her work, the company&#39;s work&#151;the work of the company that had almost 
killed her.  Now, of course, she was leading a much better life, 
although (in Soma&#39;s opinion) she was still a horrifying monster, but not 
one to be hated.  That Namie was deeply in love with her made the whole 
situation a little easier to bear.  At least now she had somebody.

Pandora the Gambler left their apartment with her body shaking and her 
mind reeling.  These two women were not bad people, just victims of 
their own genetic affliction.  She couldn&#39;t hate somebody that didn&#39;t 
deserve it, somebody that had never wished anybody harm&#151;just a peaceful 
life, that&#39;s all.  Whether her hatred for superhuman creatures in 
general faded or not was uncertain; she had a lot of thoughts to sift 
through.  When she came back, few people hailed her return.  Yohko was 
in her room, doing whatever she did in there, and nobody else liked 
Pandora enough to even say hello to her&#151;except one.

&quot;Where have you been?&quot; asked Alyssa Hunter.  For once, Soma didn&#39;t feel 
like snapping at the copper-skinned freak.

&quot;Just out.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t look so well.&quot;  Soma clutched her stomach.  No, she 
definitely didn&#39;t feel well at all.

&quot;I&#39;ve been a little sick.  I vomited today.  I&#39;m not the kind to throw 
up.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Is there...anything I can do for you?&quot;

&quot;You could get out of my way,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;Your presence sickens 
me.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;  Strangely enough, Alyssa smiled and backed down.  &quot;Well, it looks 
like you&#39;re back to your old self again.&quot;

&quot;...Shut up.&quot;

Later...

Soma was meditating quietly by herself at a table when she noticed 
somebody coming up to her with a tea tray.  It was Alyssa, dressed in 
another one of her strange suits.  Pandora didn&#39;t feel like company, but 
neither was she in the mood to dismiss anybody.  She felt sapped of 
energy and spirit&#151;maybe because of her unusual illness, maybe because 
she had been in close proximity to two freaks and had felt no hatred for 
them.  In any case, Alyssa joined her.

&quot;I thought you could use some tea,&quot; she said, setting the tray down.  
Soma watched as Alyssa poured hot tea from a kettle, and studied the 
steam for a few seconds as her &quot;guest&quot; sat down and sipped at her own 
cup.  Alyssa chuckled.  &quot;It&#39;s not poisoned!&quot;  Soma wasn&#39;t thinking that, 
but now that Alyssa had brought it to mind...

&quot;God,&quot; she groaned after Soma finally got a taste, &quot;I&#39;ve never seen 
anybody drink tea with such sarcasm.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; mumbled the older woman.  &quot;Why are you here, anyway?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m curious about you.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s there to be curious about?  I hate people with special powers.&quot;

&quot;But you have special powers.&quot;

&quot;Nope.  I&#39;m one hundred percent genuine human.&quot;

&quot;Then what about...&quot;

&quot;Machines,&quot; she explained, motioning to her back (which was absent of 
its accessory).  She pointed to her prosthetic eyeball and said, &quot;See 
this?  It determines the fate of the roulette wheel I carry around.  
Whole lot of nonsense involved, but basically how I get my so-called 
powers.&quot;

&quot;But if you hate superheroes so much...&quot;

&quot;Why do I even have them?  Simple&#151;to prove that not only can normal 
people like me wield these gifts, but we can fight and beat the ones 
with &#145;real&#39; gifts.  Basically it&#39;s a form of evolution I had created 
specifically for me.  And I&#39;m not the only one.  The doc has 
modifications as well.&quot;

&quot;You mean Yohko?&quot; said Siren with a gasp.  Pandora smiled grimly.

&quot;Oh yeah, but you don&#39;t notice it.  And I&#39;m not gonna tell you what they 
are either.  We&#39;re real close, see, the doc and I.  We agree on a lot of 
things because we&#39;re both very normal people who have responded to great 
tragedy by modifying our bodies so we can match and destroy that which 
has ruined us.&quot;  This information scared Siren more than anything else 
she had heard in the past few days.  That Pandora was telling her this 
freely without any hesitation only made it worse.  Once she got over the 
initial surprise and remembered to breathe, she had to ask why.

&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot;

&quot;No point in not doing it,&quot; she said, shrugging.  &quot;I figure sooner or 
later I&#39;ll kill you; you may as well hear why.&quot;

&quot;And why is that?&quot;

&quot;Because I hate people with special powers.&quot;

&quot;But why?  Aren&#39;t you becoming one yourself?&quot;

&quot;Not me,&quot; she said deadpan, sipping her tea.  &quot;I remain completely 
human; the doc even tested me to see if I&#39;d have the superhuman gene 
once I was &#145;modified&#39;.  The results were...pleasing.  As for why I hate 
them...it&#39;s a long story.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got time,&quot; offered Hunter.  Soma scoffed.

&quot;Any more time spent around you and my skin will crawl, so I&#39;ll give you 
the short version.  Basically, people with special powers took away 
somebody very precious to me, and I won&#39;t be able to sleep comfortably 
until I slaughter every single one and have my revenge.&quot;

&quot;But not everybody you hate did that!&quot; insisted Alyssa.  Pandora stood, 
grunting a little as her muscles propelled her from the chair.

&quot;No...and I know for a fact that you didn&#39;t kill him either.  But it 
doesn&#39;t make any difference to me.  You have unusual gifts, and that&#39;s 
enough to earn my revulsion.&quot;  She tipped her hat and left Siren cold, 
wondering what could&#39;ve been so painful to stir up such a sense of 
vengeance in the woman&#39;s heart.  &quot;Somebody very precious&quot;?  A family 
member?  A lover?  A close friend?  It could&#39;ve been anybody.  Alyssa 
took a deep breath, but decided not to follow Soma.  She just sat by 
herself, drinking tea, letting her thoughts settle in.

......

Sally was released from the medical ward later that day, and except for 
a bit of hunger, she felt no different than before.  If Mr. White had 
really worked a miracle on her, he certainly did it better than Sally 
could&#39;ve realized.  She didn&#39;t even feel dizzy or sick, like one would 
expect to feel after surgery.  Her leg was functioning like it hadn&#39;t 
been touched at all; she even tested it by running around and playing 
with Stevenson and Merry, who were both overjoyed to see her about.  
Sarah had quietly declined to join them; she tended to the garden that 
everyone still affectionately called Aura&#39;s own.

Oftentimes, it is the calmest day which brings the most severe storms. 

As Sarah was tending the garden (with Joyce, Aura, and Haanz) and Merry, 
Stevenson, and Sally were playing, a great black shadow fell over most 
of the property.  Those who were outside at the moment looked up, 
wondering if it was an eclipse&#151;but this was far worse.  A great 
bird-shaped creature was descending to the ground, so huge that it 
blotted out the sun, and created a shadow large enough to encompass the 
whole building and then some.  Sarah recognized it as her brother&#39;s Roc, 
the great deity of avian creatures he sometimes called to his services.  
But Akio was not riding on it, like an angel come back from the dead:  
the host was nine strong, all maliciously wicked.

When the bird landed, everyone flocked out to see their visitors, even 
Soma and Yohko.  Most of them recognized their diabolical guests&#151;they 
were the team of five men and two women called &quot;The Seven&quot;, and among 
them was also the wizened, tall, wild-eyed man called Ezekiel, the 
Seeker, greatest of the Dead Zodiac.  When he and Aura locked eyes, she 
couldn&#39;t help but cower.  But even these eight were just slivers of a 
shade, compared to the black void, the &quot;dark star&quot;, the cultist leader 
known only as Omega.

He and the man in white stared at each other, and together, the two 
otherworldly creatures understood what was about to transpire.
