Sunset City General Hospital, Brookwood East District

Ryo had been quick to get everything together after what happened to 
Yun-Yun and the Mao-Kung Dojo. He quickly called an ambulance for the 
downed Chinese girl and got in touch with Shun Son Lee, who had been 
visiting a friend at a neighbouring dojo. Once that had been taken care 
of Ryo then called Kayde. He had work to do at Whiteout but this was far 
more important. He took the night off and came as quickly as he could to 
Sunset City General Hospital. Thankfully Yun-Yun had no serious 
injuries. That was at least one thing they could be thankful for. The 
two youths stood outside the door to Yun-Yun&#39;s room. She was resting up 
in bed now and they stayed outside to keep things quiet for her. She had 
seen enough stress. The last thing they wanted to do now was to wake her 
up whilst they were talking. 

Ryo sat on one of the chairs on the outside of Yun-Yun&#39;s room, waiting 
around patiently for any more news about Yun-Yun (if any was coming). 
Kayde stood up, leaning against the wall of the room. Watching the 
doctors go by every few minutes. This all seemed so out of the blue. But 
they couldn&#39;t help but smell all the foul play that was at work. 

&quot;This is all just too convenient...&quot; Kayde said grimly, &quot;That Cyria 
woman invites you to a meeting that barely lasts three minutes and then 
Yun-Yun is attacked? Hmph. This was what they must have planned all 
along. But why?&quot;

Ryo shook his head. &quot;It&#39;s obvious. To get at me. I know I didn&#39;t say 
anything before, but when I was at the Rainthorn Building, I was 
attacked by some woman named Black Widow. She tried to kill me but she 
wasn&#39;t enough for that. I&#39;m sure that Cyria was the one who hired her to 
kill me.&quot;

Kayde thought about that. &quot;...Hmm. She must have thought that the 
assassin after you would not be enough. She must have had Rockeye attack 
the Mao-Kung Dojo for her while you were busy in the Rainthorn Building. 
I knew there was something wrong with the KAIGA Group. I have no idea 
what that Cyria is up to, but... Rockeye must be in her pocket.&quot;

&quot;...Rockeye...&quot; Ryo socked his fist into his palm, &quot;...That sneaky, 
muscle-headed son of a bitch! I swear that I&#39;ll kill him!&quot;

The American blonde shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t bother wasting that energy on 
Rockeye. He was just a lackey. A lapdog. He probably doesn&#39;t even know 
the real reason that Cyria had him attack the Mao-Kung Dojo. Right now 
we have to concentrate on Cyria. She&#39;s the real enemy here. It&#39;s about 
time we realized it.&quot;

&quot;So how are we gonna handle this?&quot; Asked Ryo.

Kayde crossed his arms. &quot;We&#39;re going to meet with that woman and see 
what it is she wants from you. If she&#39;s willing to use a street punk to 
attack an innocent in all of this then I can guess that she&#39;s up to no 
good.&quot;

Ryo thought about his meeting with her. Even then he didn&#39;t trust her. 
&quot;She did say something about my Father a couple of times. I wonder if 
she knows more about him and his death than she&#39;s letting on?&quot;

&quot;Hopefully you&#39;ll have your chance to ask her,&quot; Kayde answered, &quot;Because 
you and I are going to the Rainthorn Building for some answers.&quot;

Hutchingham Apartment Building, North-Western District

&quot;...You&#39;re getting ready to kill her, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Maya laid out under covers of her bedspread. They were clinging tightly 
to her body. The night had gone well for them. While at the Diamond Star 
they were able to relax and open up to each other. Which was good news 
for Maya. She was a journalist but she cared more for Liza than anything 
else. She wanted Liza to believe in her. To trust her even with her 
darkest secrets. Which was something that Liza had lots of. Secrets. The 
biggest being that she was a member of an elite Swiss family, the 
Argand, who were known to be in the business of assassination for as 
long as mankind had been walking the earth. The secrecy that Liza was 
bound to was proof of how much the Argand Family risked if their true 
nature came into the public eye. Which was why it might not have been in 
her best interests to date a journalist. It was the biggest problem that 
their relationship had. And although Maya had no intention of doing 
anything like that, it was just a matter of convincing Liza of as much. 

Liza herself was not in bed. She was buzzing around her apartment 
building to get ready for what she had planned. For her duty and 
mission. For the honour of the proud Argand Family. The snow-blonde 
assassin was dressed only in her pink bra and panties as she skirted 
around the room for the things she needed. Just her clothes mainly. But 
everything needed to be taken care of before anything happened tonight. 
She and Maya had had a good night up until now. Thus she wanted to leave 
on a good note.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Liza finally answered, &quot;Camilla has to die. There are no ifs, 
ands or buts about the issue. The honour of my Family is at state. She 
has broken our laws for far too long as it is.&quot;

&quot;I know that. But can you really bring yourself to kill your own flesh 
and blood?&quot; Maya questioned curiously. 

Liza stopped whilst searching through her chest of drawers. &quot;...I don&#39;t 
want to kill her. I am not her biggest fan... but... I can sympathize 
with her will to act on her own. To have personal glory rather than 
scraping at the coattails of the family. All members of our group have 
faced such a dilemma. Even me. It&#39;s nothing new.&quot;

&quot;...So then why?&quot; Asked Maya.

&quot;Because I didn&#39;t betray the Argand Family by acting on my misgivings,&quot; 
Replied Liza, &quot;Camilla wanted individual triumph at any cost. She 
forsook her right to live on the day she began killing in her own name. 
She broke our laws. Tore my Family apart. In the name of both my Uncle 
and my Father... she must die.&quot;

Maya lowered her face. &quot;I can&#39;t convince you to do otherwise, can I?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Liza retorted frankly, &quot;...You can&#39;t. It&#39;s out of my hands now 
anyway. Camilla has forfeited her right to wield the name of Black Widow 
and Argand. I have to right her wrongs. If I turn back on that now... 
then I&#39;m no better than she is.&quot;

That pretty much confirmed that there was no way she could convince Liza 
to let this whole &#39;family pride&#39; thing go. And so Liza got ready. From 
her chest of drawers she took a small white top with the image of a rose 
on it. From the next drawer down she took out a relatively short white 
leather skirt. And beside her chest of drawers was a pair of length 
white high heel boots. Liza put it all on bit by bit. Then attached a 
certain bracelet to her wrist. Maya remembered that. Liza had told her 
that the silver bracelet was given to members of the Argand Family who 
were in contention to become head of the house. Now Maya began to 
understand how important this was to the other woman. Liza was the 
future successor to the Argand Family. Thus she had to carry out their 
laws to the bitterest end. There was one last thing she needed. 

Liza pulled up her thumb and bit it. Blood slipped from the cut. Liza 
smeared her blood on her cheeks in a line, one over each of her cheeks. 
The marking symbol action of an Argand Assassin with the duty to kill 
one of their own. 

She was no longer Elizabeth Argand.

In this form, she was the fearless assassin, White Rose.

Rainthorn Building, North-Central District

It was the middle of the night. 

Kayde and Ryo stood at the front doors of the Rainthorn Building of the 
North-Central district. Yun-Yun was resting back at the general 
hospital. With Shun Son Lee finally there, she would be more than safe. 
Shun was an accomplished Grand Master. And far stronger than Yun-Yun 
herself (after all he was her teacher). She could have been left in no 
safer hands. The two of them left the hospital behind and went off to 
this particular district to meet up with Miss Cyria Mau herself. It was 
time they had some answers. About what her true intentions were. And how 
they involved Ryo. The two teens watched around for anything. The 
building had been closed up for the night. Most of the bodyguards were 
gone. The building probably had security systems but this thing couldn&#39;t 
wait. They had to find Cyria now.

Kayde looked up at the towering heights of the Rainthorn Building. &quot;So 
her office is at the top of the building, huh? I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll 
still be around but we might as well search the place. Even if she&#39;s not 
in there... we could find some info on where she lives or learn of some 
places she frequents often.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make her pay for this,&quot; Ryo seethed, &quot;First she tries to have me 
killed and then she orders that moron Rockeye to attack the Mao-Kung 
Dojo? Agh! It gets me pissed just thinking about it!&quot;

Kayde tossed his bangs. &quot;...Calm down. Getting flustered about this will 
do nobody any good at all. Just try to relax and focus any anger you 
feel into energy. Now lets just do this thing and find out the truth.&quot;

Ryo nodded in acceptance of that. The American youth Kayde rolled his 
head around his shoulders and stepped forwards, to the revolving glass 
doors that were currently locked. He pulled up one of his legs and then 
smashed it through the pane of glass on one of those doors. It shattered 
into tiny fragments, all falling to the ground like snow. Kayde then 
reached in and broke the inner lock on the door. It swerved open to 
allow access. Kayde gestured over to Ryo as he walked in. And the 
Japanese lad followed along. Though it wasn&#39;t filled with flair, Kayde&#39;s 
way had gotten them in easily enough. 

The whole of the building was pitch black in darkness now. It would be a 
chore to find the light now so they didn&#39;t bother. They simply walked 
forwards to the lift that would take them to Cyria&#39;s floor. Until...

&quot;Hold it!&quot;

Kayde and Ryo froze as the lights suddenly came on. The dark room was 
suddenly filled with luminosity and revealed that third voice. He was on 
his own but just the sight of him made Ryo&#39;s stomach turn. 

Ryo seethed out his name through gritted teeth. &quot;Rockeye...&quot;

The burly, hulking man stood at the other side of the room with his arms 
crossed and with a violent smile of intent on his face. He looked just 
as burly as ever. But from the expressions on Ryo and Kayde, they were 
far less happy to see him.

&quot;So,&quot; The giant began, &quot;You remembered me. After you humiliated me at 
the Whiteout I was gagging for a chance to get you back for what you 
did. Taking care of the Chinese girl might not have been very direct... 
but it did the trick, right?&quot; 

&quot;Bastard!&quot; Ryo shouted, &quot;You think I&#39;m gonna go easy on you again after 
what you did to Yun-Yun?! You scum, I&#39;ll rip your damn guts out!&quot; 

But before Ryo even got the chance, and believe me, he was ready to, 
Kayde stuck a hand out and blocked the Japanese fighter from kicking off 
anything with the titanic Rockeye.

&quot;What are you doing!?&quot; Ryo yelled out, &quot;He has to pay!&quot;

Kayde nodded. &quot;Yes. He does. And he will. I&#39;ll handle this guy. You just 
concentrate on Cyria. You said it yourself. This might be your only 
chance to find out the truth about your father. She might know 
something. And we can&#39;t assure Yun-Yun&#39;s safety, or our own, until we 
figure out what she&#39;s planning.&quot;

Though Ryo Asagawa was still burning with anger, he accepted that much. 
Kayde could take care of Rockeye. Cyria was the true enemy at the heart 
of it all. After throwing one last look of hatred at Rockeye, he ran 
towards the lift and pressed the button that would take him to the 25th 
floor. 

It was time... to find the truth.
