<h1>All Girls School (part 101 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch100.html">Back to Part 100</a><pre>&quot;The Magnificent Performance&quot;

At first glance, badgers looked like cute, cuddly, furry woodland 
creatures, timid and tiny, easily placed in the arms of a trusting 
child. But woe fell upon those who trusted the deceptive outer 
appearance, for inside the heart of this innocent little critter was a 
monster, a true force of nature. Badgers were some of the nastiest 
fighters in the whole animal kingdom, and was infamous for its lack of 
self-preservation. They&#39;d fight against anything: snake, cougar, wolf, 
owl, crocodile, bear, it didn&#39;t matter. This ferociousness no doubt 
inspired Stanton&#39;s all-girls school to adapt the badger as their motto. 
After all, the girls might&#39;ve looked harmless, but they were a force to 
be reckoned with.

Already the mighty Stanton Badgers were making a name for themselves 
this year. When soccer season came in full swing, they swept back, 
taking victory after victory, at home and abroad. Leena used her girls 
like a master chess player, or a General to her troops, guiding them 
through times warm and strict, cold and heated, slow and fast. Of 
course, half the time the team acted like it was wobbling on injured 
legs, probably due to the absence of two of its players and the weakness 
of another one. More often than not, Kathlyn was benched in favor of 
another goalie, usually Alisha Fox, and she spent a lot of time talking 
quietly with Jocelyn and Alexis, who were also considered bench-warmers.

&quot;I don&#39;t have anyone to blame but myself,&quot; said Walker, touching her 
abdomen tenderly. &quot;If I hadn&#39;t gone and done that, I could still be up 
there helping them. At least you two have a good excuse.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ve really been trying hard,&quot; Kathlyn shot back. &quot;You have 
to remember that I was no athlete when I first joined up with you all. I 
could barely run one lap. Now I can go all the way around the soccer 
field without feeling sick.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve definitely improved, I&#39;ll give you that.&quot; Alexis sighed to 
herself and looked at Joss, or &quot;Mother Joss&quot; as they now called her. She 
had been almost completely entrusted with the duty of providing water 
and medicinal aid, even a few days after the birth of her son. It was 
almost a guarantee that she wouldn&#39;t be in any condition to play for 
awhile, unless some miracle saw the whole team advance to the finals. At 
least Kathlyn was good in a pinch; Alexis was suspended because of her 
self-inflicted injury, of which Leena firmly disapproved of.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky she even let you watch this game,&quot; emphasized Katt. &quot;You 
had some nerve trying to kill yourself. Didn&#39;t you even think about the 
team?&quot;

&quot;No, okay? What do you want me to say&#151;that I&#39;m a selfish conceited 
suicidal bitch? Then fine, I admit it. Just get off my case.&quot;

The Badgers won that game, and the next, although each victory was 
marginal. The next game was the semi-finals, then would come the grand 
championship game for the state title&#151;no doubt against Rodgerson&#39;s, 
Stanton&#39;s fierce athletic rival. Before the night of the game, which 
would be held on Laudendale&#39;s home turf, Captain Aintzane Klein gathered 
together her worthy Badgers for a psych-up conference. They all knew the 
score, but Zane wanted to cement it into their minds. After all, she and 
the other seniors played every game like it was their last, and since 
they were closing in on state finals, games had a more special meaning 
to them.

&quot;I don&#39;t have to tell you what an honor it&#39;s been playing with you 
women,&quot; she announced to the team. &quot;We&#39;ve fought, bled, won, and lost 
together. Over the four years I&#39;ve been on the team, we&#39;ve seen a lot of 
good women go on to be excellent athletes, and we&#39;ve met a lot of new 
recruits who will no doubt continue our shining legacy. I stand before 
you all here tonight a contented woman. Even if we lose this next match, 
I will be happy if I&#39;ve given it everything I had. But since we&#39;ve made 
it this far, I say we shoot for a second straight year as the state 
champs!&quot; All the girls cheered out loud, and didn&#39;t calm down for a long 
time.

&quot;Also,&quot; said Klein, waving her hands to calm her teammates down, &quot;I&#39;m 
here to announce the person I would like to succeed me. All of you are 
worthy of the title Captain, but I think Blake...&quot; And at this, most of 
the girls gasped, whether in disbelief or joy, &quot;As loopy as she 
sometimes can be,&quot; Zane continued over the murmur, &quot;will make a fine 
Captain.&quot;

&quot;Speech! Speech!&quot; Now Blake stood up, embarrassed and shy. She ruffled 
her autumn-colored hair and coughed.

&quot;Oh, gee...uh, I dunno what to say. I guess making MVP that one year 
solidified my position. But are you sure you want me, Klein?&quot;

&quot;Either you or Ivory,&quot; came the reply. Ivory grinned.

&quot;What? Who, me? Sweet! But why&#39;d you pick miss Baum first? Don&#39;t I have 
the gumption?&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re as skilled as her. You just tend to show off more on the 
field, and the Captain needs to carry with them a degree of 
seriousness.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but...she&#39;s a friggin&#39; druggie!&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s why I mentioned you. If Blake&#39;s ever negligent about 
keeping her ADD under control, then Ivory, I want you to step up.&quot;

&quot;Awriiight, kick-ass!&quot; Ivory beamed and stuck her tongue out at Blake, 
who did little in her defense.

&quot;Look, it&#39;s not about who&#39;s Captain,&quot; she told the feisty blonde. With a 
smile she added loudly, &quot;It&#39;s about how badly we can kick the other 
team&#39;s asses!!&quot; Everyone agreed with this, and spent most of the evening 
pumping themselves up. They would all have to wake up early to board the 
bus for Laudendale, so no doubt there would be a few cranky people the 
next day.

Even when the Badgers first arrived, an hour before the game began, 
there were fans filling the bleachers, and not all of them were 
fanatical followers of Stanton: some were here to see the Laudendale 
Diamonds, and a few smart people from Rodgerson&#39;s had made it just so 
they could see what sorts of tactics the other teams would perform. The 
Badgers began their sojourn on Laudendale&#39;s home field with warm-ups and 
intimidation tactics. Alexis Walker proudly suffered herself the 
position of &quot;magnet&quot; by absorbing balls kicked in her direction, 
exposing her stomach to reveal the large white bandage covering her 
wound. Most of the balls were sent straight to her Solar plexus; they 
had to be excruciating. She just took it, grinned, and begged for more.

Alisha and Erica performed a martial arts ritual they first started in 
the beginning of the season, going faster and harder at the beginning of 
each game. Both sisters showed how well they could handle punishment and 
pain, and even meek little Erica unleashed her fury, fighting back like 
a demon. Ivory just had to act like herself; Aintzane and Blake ran laps 
around both goals, chanting a fight-song they had made up over the 
course of training. Even Jocelyn and Kathlyn were in on the act, though 
they were the ones doing most of the shooting. Finally, just for fun, 
the Stanton mascot herself came lumbering out of her hiding place, large 
and furry and full of violence. It befriended the girls and gave them 
all high-fives, then made clear her intentions by thrusting a 
papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute; Diamond in the air and smashing it between her paws 
(Mihoshi was the mascot this year; the previous one had already 
graduated).

Once all this was done&#151;about twenty minutes for them, fifteen for the 
home team&#151;the referees came to inspect both teams, including all the 
women who were not participating. Jocelyn was pegged as coach&#39;s 
assistant for the duration of the season, and Katt and X were &quot;emergency 
players&quot;, but even these three were dressed up and examined. Off came 
the necklaces, the earrings, the jewelry, even some of the 
piercings&#151;anything that could pose to distract or harm the players. Next 
everyone tapped their shinguards, confirming they had them on, then 
turned around and lifted their cleats in the air, proving their 
existence and legitimacy. It was boring, yes, but it had to be done.

Aintzane the Badger and Melissa the Diamond both met up with the 
referees once protocol was taken care of. Unlike her rival Petra, Zane 
had nothing against all the other players and Captains, and was happy to 
test her mettle against this new face, no matter what was said and done 
during warm-ups. The coin tossed and Klein called tails; she lost the 
flip and got stuck with the side farthest from the visitor&#39;s locker 
room. Whether this was the good side or the irregular side, she didn&#39;t 
know, but she wasn&#39;t troubled. She considered herself the Bruce Lee of 
high school soccer: fluid, like water, able to adapt to any environment. 
A Star-Spangled Banner later, and the game was on.

Klein gets to the ball at kick-off first; she passes to Tran; Tran 
dribbles down to midfield, passes to E. Fox; Fox takes the ball and 
dribbles up the field; she&#39;s attacked by a Diamond and sent into 
defense. Diamonds send it to midfield, go for the goal, intercepted by 
Baum. Baum fakes left, drives down the line, fakes a right, hurries 
towards the goal, makes a pass; E. Fox dribbles through the Diamond&#39;s 
defense and back to Baum; Baum shoots...and misses! Diamonds gain 
control of the ball and hurl it into the field. The Diamonds now make 
for the goal, swerve through the Badgers&#39; defense, dribbling around the 
center, they make a pass; Badgers intercept it, pass to Parkin; Parkin 
dribbles, passes to Tran; Tran kicks and sends the ball hurling through 
the air; Klein heads the ball, turns, shoots...and misses! Diamonds gain 
control of the ball.

Diamonds now playing defense, dribbling and kicking in random crossing 
patterns. Klein signals to Parkin and E. Fox, then signals to Tran; 
Badgers advance on the ball, attempt to intercept; ball is passed 
further down, Tran dives deep for defense; ball is shot to the 
goal...and A. Fox intercepts it! Badgers gain control of the ball and 
hurl it back to the field; Parkin bumps it with her chest and dribbles 
it through the line; she passes to Klein; Klein shoots for Baum; Baum 
weaves through the defense, and the ball is intercepted by the Diamonds. 
Diamonds take the ball defensively, luring the Badgers into their area, 
then shoot far into the opponent&#39;s field; Parkin intercepts the ball but 
is overwhelmed by the Diamonds; Diamonds shoot...and miss! A. Fox 
catches the ball and sends it into the field.

Diamonds break like billiards and intercept the ball. Three Diamonds 
take defense, the rest go in for the kill. Badgers run out and 
triple-team the dribbler; Diamonds fake a left and pass further down. A. 
Fox shouts insults and curses to break their focus; Diamonds shoot and 
miss. A. Fox throws it into the field, and the ball is caught by her 
sister. E. Fox drives in a circular pattern around the home field, 
dribbling through the defense to search for an opening. Klein signals; 
E. Fox passes the ball to her; Klein passes to Tran; Tran shoots...and 
scores!!

GOAL!!!!

Leena closed her eyes and took a breath. So far, her team was doing 
fairly well, but she knew they could do a whole lot better. These first 
few stints were just practice, an extension of the warm-up session, a 
way for the girls to gauge their adversaries. Katt was doing better than 
anticipated, so Leena was glad she had pulled her from goalie duty. 
There was a strong difference between being a goalie for girls in gym 
class and being a goalie in a real soccer game, and even though Parkin 
had talent, Leena didn&#39;t think she would like having all that 
responsibility and pressure on her. Alisha Fox, however, loved the 
attention, and grinned throughout the whole first half of the game, even 
though she missed three balls. The game was mostly tepid during the 
first half, and the score remained a tight 3-2, with the Diamonds 
leading.

When the game stopped halfway, the girls jogged to their bench to hear 
their coach prattle. Leena wasn&#39;t much for motivational speeches, but 
she knew how skilled her players were and knew the best places to put 
them. She briefly wondered if she could put Katt back in as goalie, but 
no&#151;the second half was considerably more important than the first. She 
was good as a defensive player, so that&#39;s where she stayed (and Katt had 
no problems with it). Alisha was a little sore, but still carried her 
enthusiasm around like a banner. Leena checked her watch after awhile, 
and made a mental note that the game would start soon.

&quot;You&#39;re all doing well, but this is the time for you to be doing your 
best. If what Klein told me is correct, then the seniors in this team 
have promised to give everything they have in these games. I suggest 
that now&#39;s the time to do this, ladies. Walker,&quot; she said, addressing 
the wounded woman, &quot;which do you think you&#39;re more capable of: running 
or guarding?&quot;

&quot;Neither one, to be honest,&quot; she said with a wince. &quot;I mean, I can still 
play, just not at a hundred percent. My stomach still hurts, and I don&#39;t 
have the stitches out.&quot;

&quot;Do you want to sit this one out?&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; she snarled, rising up suddenly. &quot;Hell, this might be my very 
last game as a Badger! If I don&#39;t play, I&#39;m gonna regret it! I&#39;ve 
already sat out enough games, so it&#39;s time for me to pay you all back. 
It&#39;s the least I can do, after all the trouble I&#39;ve put the team 
through.&quot; Leena was proud at her determination, but it would take more 
than that for the injured girl to put up any kind of a fight. At least 
Dr. Andrews had cleared her for this game&#151;she had completely banned 
Jocelyn and suggested the young girl sit in as the coach&#39;s aide all 
throughout the season. Joss didn&#39;t like this, but she was still weak 
from delivering her son, and was forced to comply.

&quot;All right,&quot; said Leena, &quot;you&#39;ve resigned yourself to this game. Girls, 
as my witnesses, let the record reflect that Miss Walker volunteered for 
this game out of her own free will. Now...need I ask which position you 
want to play on?&quot;

&quot;Offense,&quot; she said without hesitation. &quot;I can take the pain. Alisha&#39;s a 
better goalie than me anyway, plus she&#39;s a lot quicker. Remember, nobody 
can stop the Fox sisters.&quot;

&quot;Ya got that right!&quot; exclaimed Alisha. The two seniors slapped hands 
together, and together, the team smiled at Leena. She got them to pile 
their hands together and call out a victory chant.

&quot;May the mighty Stanton Badgers take this thing all the way!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re gonna kick their ass and look good doing it!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ready to run until I burst!&quot;

&quot;YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Our feet are filled with fury; our hearts strong with pride; our bodies 
bold and strong.&quot;

&quot;The spirit of the sport is within us all!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s go out and show the world what we&#39;re made of,&quot; Zane concluded. 
Leena smiled, feeling as if everyone was taking this too seriously. 
After all, it was just a game.

&quot;Ladies, let&#39;s just have some fun out there.&quot;

The crowd actually let out a cheer as they saw X Walker running out on 
the field, waving to all her fans and supporters. They had missed seeing 
her in the previous games, and assumed, as these hardcore fans had a way 
of doing, that the injury she sustained was now bearable enough for her 
to play on. The team would need her, too: Erica had been hurt late in 
the first half, and was benched for most of the game. Of course, she 
also took this time to socialize with Jocelyn, but that was another 
story for another time. With the Badgers now on the opposite side of the 
field, the fans supporting them and the whole season riding on this 
game, it was a good time to be alive.

Melissa of the Diamonds gets the ball first, and kicks it to her team. 
Suddenly Walker comes from out of nowhere, plows into her, and takes the 
ball into possession! She turns, she ducks, she passes; Tran has the 
ball, dribbles it through the defense, passes it; the Diamonds 
intercept, but Walker takes the ball again! She heads for the goal, 
fakes a kick, passes back; Klein&#39;s got the ball, kicks it round the 
goal, fakes a shot; passes to Walker, she shoots...she scores!

GOAL!!!

The score was tied now, with the Badgers controlling the ball. Fox 
taunts the Diamonds from her perch as the Badgers pass the ball around; 
Diamonds intercept it and carry it deep into visitor territory; they 
feign a pass and shoot wide; Tran and Walker break the kick and send it 
home; Diamonds retrieve the ball, they pass, they shoot...they score!

GOAL!!!

The score now in favor of the Diamonds, they take the ball and play 
defensive tag, running and sharing it between themselves to eat up time. 
Parkin and Klein head off the pass, the ball ends up free; Diamonds take 
it and bump it up further in visitor territory; Fox taunts them as Baum 
runs round to steal the ball; Diamonds shoot again...and miss! What a 
miraculous save! Fox, now winded, throws the ball back, and the Badgers 
take control. They wind up and pass to Walker; she plows through the 
defense with Klein and Tran covering her; Baum swerves in and handles 
it, dives deep, kicks it to Tran, she whirls suddenly and launches 
it...and scores!

GOAL!!!

The Badgers now tied with the Diamonds take the ball and move into 
defensive positions. Diamonds swerve in, miss the ball; three more 
intercept and pass it through the line. Fox resumes taunting as Parkin 
and Klein swoop in to take the ball; Tran and Baum close in for a pincer 
attack; the ball is wasted to center field; Diamonds pick it up and go 
for another goal. Klein breaks off from the team and pursues them, Baum 
flanking her; the Diamonds shoot and miss. Fox throws it back in, 
Diamonds intercept it suddenly, try for another shot...and miss! Alisha 
Fox is on fire! She hurls it back in, Parkin bounces it to Klein; Klein 
swoops around and passes to Tran; Tran goes deep but is intercepted by 
the Diamonds. Diamonds evade badgering (pun intended), go down the 
center, switch passes and keep their defensive line tight.

Badgers pursue their opponents; Fox starts to taunt (both of them now); 
McKeough gets up to work the crowd. Parkin hears Leena calling her name; 
she rushes in, takes the ball, skulks back and passes to Klein. Klein 
drives hard down the center, fakes a left, passes back to Parkin; Parkin 
drives down to Walker; Walker shoots, misses, the ball bounces, Tran 
captures it; Tran now runs to Parkin, waving her over; Parkin runs down, 
out of breath, but the crowd goes wild and Leena cheers for her; she 
takes the ball, fakes a shot, passes to Baum; she shoots...she scores!

GOAL!!!

The Badgers take their first lead since the start of the game! With the 
score 4-5 in favor of Stanton and the clock ticking down, the Diamonds 
know they&#39;re in a tight spot. They regroup and rally around their 
Captain, following through for an offensive blitz. Diamonds shield the 
Captain from the defense, she kicks and parleys; Diamonds jump back and 
volley the ball between them; Melissa gets a clear shot, she shoots, and 
scores! Alisha Fox does not like that! Now the Diamonds have the ball 
again; they feint back and make a pass for center field. Badgers run in 
pursuit; the offense closes in, defense hanging back to watch the ball; 
Diamonds make a sudden hard kick straight for the goal, Fox intercepts 
it; the ball&#39;s free; Diamonds swoop in to dunk it in; it&#39;s good!

GOAL!!!

The Diamonds have now regained their lead and are tearing the field 
apart. Klein rallies her team for one last blitz and pursues the 
Diamonds. Baum and Parkin head off the kicker and intercept the ball; 
they pass it between themselves down to the center; Tran comes along to 
take the ball; she&#39;s intercepted by the Diamonds who send the ball back 
to visitor territory; Badgers shuffle and fight over the free ball, Fox 
spewing vulgarities (her sister rolling her eyes); Diamonds come in and 
brawl for the rights; they take the ball and dribble it down the field; 
Melissa kicks it in...no good! Fox grabs it and hurls it back in. Klein 
tags the ball and sends offense down for a long pass. She sends the ball 
into the air; Tran taps it with her head, jerks around, shoots...no 
good! Diamonds throw the ball back in, Klein rushes in to intercept, 
Baum and Tran come up from the side, Parkin the rear; Klein sweeps her 
legs...

And a buzzer sounds. The game is over, with a score of 5-4 favoring the 
Laudendale Diamonds.

Aintzane Rikke Klein froze stiff, dead and dumb to the world as the 
sounds of adulation washed over her. She had lost. Her team had lost. 
They weren&#39;t going to the championship game. They weren&#39;t going to win 
state. They had just...lost.

No. They had not lost. The Badgers had merely been defeated by a worthy 
team. They did not lose&#151;nay, they could not lose. After all, hadn&#39;t they 
played their best? Hadn&#39;t they come through as a team? Hadn&#39;t they all 
fought hard, each woman contributing in her own way? As this new level 
of realization came over her, Zane brightened up, smiled, and let out 
the greatest victory cry she was capable of. Yes, the Badgers had not 
won the match, but that didn&#39;t mean they lost it, either. After all, 
there was nothing wrong with second place, nothing at all.

Soon, everyone caught their Captain&#39;s enthusiasm, and banded together 
for a massive victory huddle, confusing the other team. Together they 
lifted Leena in their arms and paraded her across the field, laughing 
and shouting all the way. Once they let her down, the Badgers played the 
role of good sports and congratulated their worthy opponents on an 
excellent game&#151;some, naturally, making mental notes to inquire about 
these beautiful strong soccer girls later.

Since Leena was the kind of person who would treat her team to a nice 
victory meal no matter what the outcome of the game, they all went out 
to the local Shakenstein&#39;s for burgers, fries, and the legendary shakes. 
The bus they took was thick with noise and jubilation; girls traded &quot;war 
stories&quot; and bragged about how everyone else had been so great in those 
few fleeting moments. Aintzane herself was a little quiet, so much so 
that she garnered the attention of her fellow soccer pals.

&quot;Whassa matta Zanie, you sad that you not gonna play with your Petra?&quot; 
crooned Ivory.

&quot;Yeah, Zaney was hoping to run into her bitch in the finals!&quot; added 
Walker. &quot;Oh yeah, let&#39;s play the rivalry game! Don&#39;t forget to take a 
peek in the locker room, Zane-honey!&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; she groused. &quot;And leave me alone.&quot;

&quot;Aww, why, you got a certain Russian on your mind?&quot;

&quot;I told you to knock it off,&quot; she bit. Most of the girls loved teasing 
her and making fun at her, and even Kathlyn was in on the fun. Leena 
didn&#39;t come to her defense, and was actually pretty tempted to tease her 
as well, but she knew better than that.

&quot;So what&#39;s the real reason you&#39;re all blue?&quot; she wondered. Klein 
sniffed.

&quot;Well...I&#39;m just pissed off that I won&#39;t be able to knock that bitch 
flat on her egotistical Kremlin-loving face in the finals. And don&#39;t say 
it&#39;s the love of one rival to the next: she seriously gets on my 
nerves.&quot; The other girls looked at each other knowingly, and shared a 
big, smarmy smile.

&quot;Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuurrrrrre!!!&quot;</pre>
