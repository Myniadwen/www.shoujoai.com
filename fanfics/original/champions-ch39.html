It was dark again by the time Rin, Aura, Kailin, Angel and the others 
arrived. Dr. Kamaguchi looked delighted to see the additions, and filled 
out nearly every room, placing Ferret with the Ronin (as they requested) 
and Snowblood in Lyn&#39;s room. Lyn actually took a liking to Snowblood, 
perhaps because they were both a little antisocial and independent, so 
it wasn&#39;t as if the arrangement was bad. Ferret herself loved the living 
arrangement and set about acquainting herself with her friends, both of 
which were very much alive. She began exercising odd traits once settled 
in, though, such as dressing and undressing in confined spaces and 
refusing to swim or bathe with anyone else, but otherwise her cheerful 
demeanor and friendliness was welcome. She even managed to get through 
to Joyce and Sarah, although those two spent most of their time with 
each other.

Since they roomed together, along with Alisti and Skye, it made sense 
that they would grow close. They were almost the same age, just a few 
months apart, and could relate to each other in terms of their painful 
experience. Joyce soon opened up to her new friend, as she had opened up 
to Aura, but also told her secrets that nobody else knew. She did not 
reveal anything about her power, not until witnessing Sarah&#39;s first. She 
noticed a gorgeous butterfly perched on the young lady&#39;s head, giving 
her an otherworldly look, and gasped in awe.

&quot;Her name is Kari,&quot; Sarah explained. &quot;Except for my brother, she was my 
only friend growing up. When we were born, my brother and I fell under 
the power of the kikai, the destructive bugs. They are tools that 
require our bodily energy to operate; in turn, we were blessed with 
their aide. I was given mastery over insects; my brother&#39;s power was 
weaker, but broader in aspect. He could control animals as well.&quot;

&quot;So that was him,&quot; murmured Joyce sadly. Sarah nodded. &quot;I&#39;m really 
sorry, Sarah. If I had known...&quot;

&quot;There was no way you could have,&quot; she assured her. &quot;And...even though I 
still hate that woman for what she did, I suppose I should be glad that 
Akio never killed anybody. Hey, guess what! I&#39;m going to make her my 
servant! She&#39;s going to take care of me for as long as I want!&quot; She and 
Joyce giggled&#151;Jameson wasn&#39;t that fond of G-Force either, despite the 
older woman&#39;s efforts at friendship. They scooted closer to each other 
and smiled, two girls with dreadful powers coming to terms with each 
other.

&quot;So what about you?&quot; whispered Sarah, slipping her hand inside Joyce&#39;s. 
&quot;I heard you were partially responsible for stopping that guy, Suo or 
whatever he was called.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; she croaked, lowering her face. &quot;I used my power. I didn&#39;t 
want him to kill Rin, but I didn&#39;t want to destroy him either. I don&#39;t 
know why I even have this stupid power! Was it because mom and dad died 
before I was even born? Is it because God hates me? Am I a devil, or am 
I possessed? I don&#39;t know!&quot;

&quot;What is it exactly?&quot; said Sarah, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking.&quot; Joyce 
whimpered and looked away, too frightened of herself and her abilities 
to say. But she liked Sarah, she trusted her, so maybe...

&quot;If I tell you, you&#39;ll just be afraid.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not afraid of my power, why should I be afraid of yours?&quot; 
Jameson smiled weakly.

&quot;Cuz&#39; it&#39;s scarier.&quot; Sarah giggled softly, squeezed Joyce&#39;s hand, and 
leaned in to show her support. Jameson finally sighed and gave in, &quot;But 
you have to promise not to tell anyone, okay?&quot;

&quot;All right. I won&#39;t.&quot; Sigh. Joyce stared directly into the Butterfly&#39;s 
silvery eyes.

&quot;If I concentrate hard enough...I can make people afraid. My power shows 
them their absolute worst fear, and makes it as if it&#39;s real. It then 
magnifies it to an unbearable degree, until their mind is destroyed from 
the load. Nobody can handle that much terror for long, not even scary 
people. And everybody has something they&#39;re mortally afraid of.&quot;

&quot;...That&#39;s it?&quot; whispered Sarah, who had to admit that it was a scary 
power. Joyce nodded.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it. It works on everybody too&#151;a psychological attack that 
has no defense, and I can do it on whoever I choose. I think Dr. 
Kamaguchi calls it a...telekinetic ability, or more like a 
phobia-kinetic ability. She said that she could help me treat it, but I 
don&#39;t like her.&quot; Sarah was still in shock from hearing about the 
dreadful skill, but she managed to smile and keep her grip on Joyce&#39;s 
cold hand.

&quot;Yeah, me neither.&quot; The two girls giggled&#151;then, as if it were nothing at 
all, Sarah changed the subject and asked Joyce what her favorite things 
in the world were. Seeing that her new friend really did accept her for 
what she was, not calling her a monster or a freak of genetic mutation 
(she had overheard Yohko herself saying that), Joyce opened herself up 
even more and talked up a storm.

.........

Sometime later that day, close to the evening, a strange visitor came to 
the gates of the building, claiming to be a refugee from one of the 
places that had been hit by the Dead Zodiac. He stumbled through the 
door and was quickly aided by the receptionist, while Sally rushed ahead 
and prepared a place in the clinic. The man, who gave his name as 
Darred, had been attacked while he left his town, and attacked again 
while at sea. Most of his fellow refugees had been killed or imprisoned, 
leaving him fortunate enough to escape. He only stayed in the clinic 
long enough to regain his senses, and asked to be sent to the leader&#39;s 
quarters.

Dr. Kamaguchi was off on a business call, and all the high-level 
associates were also away, but Aura was more than happy to accompany 
Darred. She brought him into the kitchen and gave him some soup, then 
sat back and listened as he revealed some very valuable information 
concerning their enemies. The remaining members of the Dead Zodiac had 
built a secret warehouse somewhere in the country, and it had been 
stocked full of modern weapons, including very powerful and volatile 
explosives. Darred and his crew had stumbled across it, and paid for it 
with their lives.

&quot;If your friends can capture or destroy this warehouse, they&#39;ll have an 
advantage for when the enemy mounts their next attack, they will,&quot; he 
said. &quot;The Dead Zodiac will be crippled and you will have secured 
yourselves a strong foothold. Miss Valeria, I wanna repay you and your 
friends for taking me in like this. Let me guide you to this warehouse, 
and see to it that its contents are ransacked and its walls burned to 
the ground.&quot;

&quot;I will consider what you have said,&quot; she replied thoughtfully. 
&quot;Stealing the enemy&#39;s weapons is a dangerous thing to do, and we have 
very few people here who could operate such things. I would rather 
destroy the weapons and the warehouse at the same time, so as to not 
allow anything to slip into the enemy&#39;s hands. Would you not think so?&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s your decision,&quot; he shrugged. She nodded her head.

&quot;We&#39;re grateful to you for this piece of information. We should probably 
set out there today. I will take some people along with me to oversee 
this. Be prepared in one hour.&quot;

&quot;Um, ducky, how do you expect to slip into the country so quickly? It&#39;s 
quite a distance, it is, very far away. Unless you got some teleporters 
or somethin&#39;, you&#39;re in for quite a stroll.&quot; She gave him a confident 
smile, and led him outside into the main hallway, down the stairs and 
into the commissary.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. We have ways of getting around. All you need to 
do is prepare and make sure we get there. I will take any opportunity to 
set the enemy back, if I can.&quot;

&quot;Very well. Good day.&quot; Darred smiled and watched as Aura jogged ahead of 
him, apparently already knowing who to take with her. He bit his lip and 
hoped that the plan would work; his enemies needed to pay for what they 
did.

......

Marissa Wainright took a breather midway up the trail, her knapsack 
weighing her down and her small team of travelers somewhat weary from 
the climb. It had been her idea to take them all exercising, hoping to 
get a few hours&#39; worth of muscle and stamina into their bodies before 
things started to heat up. It was a welcome change working with Alisti, 
Merry, Julie, and Amielle again, even though most of them were out of 
shape.

&quot;What a view!&quot; exclaimed Merry happily as she stood proud and tall on a 
cliff the trail led into. The pink-haired woman wasn&#39;t fond of heights, 
but even she knew she was safe on that dusty path. She stood a healthy 
distance away from the edge and smiled broadly as she viewed the entire 
surrounding land and parts of the city. The MERCS headquarters was like 
the connection point between civilization and the wild, standing out as 
a glint of pale gray and blue against the green and brown of the land. 
The hubbub of the city, far off in the distance, added a musical echo to 
the scene. Alisti smiled and wheeled next to her.

PRETTY. ALSO...TEMPORARY. LEAVING...SOON.

&quot;Not that soon,&quot; argued Amielle, crossing her arms to join them. &quot;We&#39;ve 
got lots of work to do before we can put our backs to this place.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re using an awful lot of plural words,&quot; remarked Marissa wittily. 
Amielle returned her smirk.

&quot;Well, I changed when I was away from you all. I think it was because I 
wasn&#39;t anywhere near you stinking girls.&quot; Merry bellowed and grabbed the 
younger girl in a headlock before she could fight back.

&quot;Aw, c&#39;mon, you like us!!&quot;

&quot;L...let go, you big oaf!&quot; She wrestled free and stumbled to the side, 
preferring the company of loneliness. Merry just chuckled, content to 
look at the landscape before them. Julie, looking bored, yawned.

&quot;We moving on or we stopping forever?&quot;

&quot;Hold your horses, kid,&quot; grunted Merry; &quot;let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t have a 
light snack first.&quot; She and the others set down their packs and dug into 
them, searching for their canteens. They each popped one out and swished 
their mouths with the water, then split their lunches, Marissa having to 
feed Alisti. Celestino loosened her limbs and secretly wondered how many 
years more they would serve her. Despite being a child of shadows and 
darkness, she knew she wouldn&#39;t last forever. She just couldn&#39;t. It 
wasn&#39;t right.

&quot;I guess we can rest for a few seconds, then,&quot; she stated flatly as she 
ate. The group would refresh themselves and have a brief snack, and 
then&#151;

Suddenly, Marissa shrieked as a fiery pain blasted her. The psychic 
powers she had been cursed with at birth were acting up violently.

&quot;AAH!!!&quot; She clutched her head and plummeted to the floor, overwhelmed 
by the sudden surge that had snapped at her. The others crowded around 
her instantly, wondering if she was okay or not. Marissa took in a deep, 
slow, hissing breath, grimacing from the sudden pain. What was that?

&quot;Hey, Wainright! Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;I dunno, Amielle,&quot; she cringed. &quot;It feels like my head is on fire! I 
wonder if something&#39;s wrong with&#151;&quot;

And then it hit her.

Aura! Something bad was going to happen!

&quot;Oh my god! I&#39;ve got to go! Everyone, run down the path as fast as you 
can and get to the base! We have to stop Aura from leaving!&quot;

&quot;But what&#151;&quot;

&quot;Just do it!!&quot; She couldn&#39;t help snarling at his crew; Marissa was 
frightened and desperate. She quickly sprinted down the trail with 
everything she had in her, gaining breakneck momentum the closer she 
came to the beginning. The girl nearly slipped and tumbled several 
times, and in fact did crash once as her speed was too great to contain. 
Dust and pebbles spewed down after her, pelting her as she rolled down 
the mountain like an unstoppable human snowball. Wainright scraped her 
hands and knees as she desperately tried to stop, and jogged down the 
rest of the mountain at a slower pace. The others were far behind.

Even with her increased speed to aid her, Marissa nearly burst her lungs 
and heart from so much intense activity, not to mention the minor damage 
she was putting on her new body. The feeling she had gotten was more 
intense than any pain she had felt, though&#151;she knew her friend would be 
in danger. Her psychic powers, damned though they were, never lied: it 
smelled deception and great peril. She gritted her teeth as hard as she 
could and broke out into a ferocious sprint once she was on level 
ground, covering a great distance but still not arriving at the base. 
She finally collapsed far on the outskirts of the territory, too 
exhausted to even crawl. Her harsh, struggling breath caught the 
attention of Mora, who was busy with her exercises.

&quot;By the spirits!&quot; she gasped, seeing Marissa sprawled on the floor. 
&quot;What happened?!&quot; The younger girl used up the last bit of strength she 
had to shout at her.

&quot;GET ME TO A TRANSPORT, NOW!!&quot; Cobra didn&#39;t ask questions as she saw the 
intensity of Wainright&#39;s eyes, and picked her up in her arms. She 
stirred herself to a speed she had never known before, racing faster 
than the wind as she carried her laboring ally towards the base, and 
nearly broke through the front doors. Marissa recovered somewhat during 
the journey, and tumbled inside just to see Yohko close the garage door, 
something she always did after somebody borrowed one of her transports. 
She was too late.

&quot;Doc! Where did Aura go?!&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, hi Riss! What are you&#151;&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have time for this, Doc!&quot; she blurted angrily. &quot;Where did you 
send my friend?!&quot;

&quot;Oh, goodness! Um, um, um, um...&quot; The poor woman stuttered for a second 
as all thought left her, and just before Marissa grabbed her in anger, 
she remembered. &quot;Oh yes! She said something about wanting to go to the 
other side of the city to destroy this warehouse! She took Miss Kailin 
and Miss Shou with her. Did you want to go with her?&quot;

&quot;More than anything, Doc. Hurry, she&#39;s in grave danger!&quot;

&quot;Oh, goodness! Well, I don&#39;t know if I have any reliable transports 
left...&quot;

&quot;Yohko, please!!&quot; she screamed, her wild violet eyes begging furiously. 
The poor woman jumped, and without a word, she quickly yanked open the 
garage door and rushed to the nearest transport, a beaten-up van. Sanaa, 
who had strolled by the area and stopped to see what the commotion was, 
approached her love.

&quot;Hey, Wainright, you look terrible.&quot;

&quot;Aura&#39;s in serious danger!&quot; she spat, still trying to catch her breath. 
Sanaa recoiled as she saw the intensity in her lover&#39;s eyes and voice, 
and understood immediately.

&quot;Then I&#39;m coming along, wherever you&#39;re going.&quot;

&quot;Whatever you want.&quot; Sanaa found herself becoming hollow as Marissa 
leaned on his knees, impatiently waiting for Yohko to start the car. She 
knew that Marissa had few friends, but she valued every single one with 
a priceless love, so she could understand why her lover was so upset. 
She placed her hand on Marissa&#39;s shoulder and attempted to smile.

&quot;No matter what happens there, Marissa, I&#39;m with you all the way.&quot; She 
smiled, and stood up to her full height just as the van roared to life 
at last. Yohko declined to come, saying she would just get in the way, 
but wished them luck. Both women gave her a haunting stare&#151;a grim choice 
of words, it was&#151;but got in and drove away as fast as the vehicle could 
go. An hour later, the foursome Marissa left behind at the trail came 
in, breathing hard and asking questions. Instead of being overwhelmed by 
all their voices yammering at once, Yohko sent them away and shut 
herself up in her room, plopping down on the floor to recover herself. 
What a day!

.........

Aura, Xianq, Kailin, and Darred arrived at the outskirts of the city, 
near the aforementioned warehouse. While Aura had her Vespa, she wanted 
to take a larger vehicle, and since she had asked Dr. Kamaguchi first, 
Yohko (or rather, Xianq) had loaned her the Diva&#39;s special jet-car, the 
one they had custom-made to help them go places quickly. Darred seemed 
amazed that such speed could be achieved, and was stone still for a 
second as he absorbed it all. Meanwhile, Xianq and Kailin looked around 
to see if they could find the secret weapons warehouse.

&quot;Obviously, it wouldn&#39;t be out in the open,&quot; surmised Bubblegum Black. 
&quot;Sir, you said you came across it. Where is it?&quot;

&quot;I stumbled across it somewhere over here, near this blasted area. Bit 
of a war went on; that&#39;s why me chums and I had to leave. Mind the 
mess.&quot; Darred led the trio into the ruins, across fields of ash and rock 
where smoke had long ago ceased to rise. Bodies had been buried, and 
even a few memorials had been erected for those lost in the blaze. 
Hidden behind the waste, easily camouflaged by foliage and the rocky 
surroundings, was a large warehouse that never would&#39;ve been noticed 
unless somebody knew where it was. Aura, Kailin, and even Xianq looked 
on in amazement.

&quot;After we was attacked, me crew thought that this would be the last 
place anybody would look for us,&quot; explained Darred. &quot;We came here in 
hopes of evading the Zodiac and police, and noticed the storage center. 
We looked inside out of curiosity, and found...rows and rows of guns, 
explosives, weapons, you name it. It was terrible, it was, all 
traumatizin&#39; and what. We left it and vowed to tell someone of this 
place, but many from me group was caught or killed. I was the only one 
to escape. Terrible experience, guv!&quot;

&quot;Goodness, that&#39;s quite a story!&quot; exclaimed Kailin. &quot;So this place 
wasn&#39;t guarded, right?&quot;

&quot;Aye. The recent turmoil in the city has caused all but a skeleton crew 
to withdraw. Now would be the perfect time to plunder its riches and 
destroy this place.&quot;

&quot;We should concentrate on destroying it, rather,&quot; countered Aura. 
&quot;Suppose these weapons fell into the hands of our enemy after we 
confiscated them. That would be disastrous. I&#39;d rather have them 
destroyed and out of our minds.&quot;

&quot;I understand, luv. Let me show you inside.&quot; Darred quietly led Aura, 
Xianq, and Kailin towards the warehouse, apparently not worried that he 
would be spotted. In the very back of their minds, something bothered 
them about the man&#39;s story and how coincidental everything seemed at the 
time. It was a strange feeling they couldn&#39;t quite place, and even when 
they tried, they just ended up countering it all with reason. Their 
suspicion was baseless.

Darred showed the trio to the very front door, and since Aura had opted 
to blow the entire place sky-high, he pulled out several sticks of 
powerful dynamite, &quot;Of which I had stolen from the bloody creeps,&quot; he 
explained, and boasted of their explosive capabilities. He gave a 
handful to Aura and some to Xianq, and kept the rest for himself. 
Naturally, Kailin wasn&#39;t even allowed to touch one.

&quot;Very good,&quot; he said once they were dispersed. &quot;All things seem proper! 
Now, Miss Shou, I want you to set those explosives all around the 
buildin&#39;. Use&#39;m all up. That&#39;s good.&quot; Xianq blinked her cloudy eyes in 
confusion, but did as she was asked. Darred continued, &quot;Now&#151;I&#39;m gonna 
open this door. Miss Valeria and I do not require your help, so please 
step back. Go on, go on. Now, once we&#39;re both inside, you, miss 
Kailin&#151;set a fire to these explosives, the ones I got and the ones 
around, then close this door and go back to your home.&quot; Kailin rubbed 
her eyes, trying to clear her thoughts, but there didn&#39;t seem to be 
anything worth clearing. She slowly lurched away from the door, Xianq at 
her side. Darred grinned eagerly.

Several things happened all at once just then. First, Kailin shot a tiny 
fireball to the explosives, just barely touching the fuse with her 
flame. Second, Marissa Wainright and Sanaa came rumbling out of the 
distance and flew from their vehicle, not even bothering to stop it. 
They landed right in between Kailin and Xianq, noticing Darred carrying 
an entire sack of explosives, and Aura standing next to him in a daze. 
Marissa&#39;s head burned considerably, but her pain was cleansing and pure, 
as the Truth of the situation finally came to her mind. Marissa 
Wainright, unaffected by lies and deceit, saw through the treachery of 
Darred the Numb-Mind, one of the Dead Zodiac, and it was too late.

Darred grinned cruelly, his ordinary appearance betraying the sinister 
powers locked inside of him, and thrust himself and Aura inside the 
warehouse, just as the fire closed in on the dynamite. Marissa screamed 
for her friend, willing her mind to spread its powers over the entire 
area. Xianq, Sanaa, and Kailin were instantly cleansed of confusion and 
saw Darred&#39;s scheme for what it was; Aura saw too, but was too petrified 
to do anything. As Marissa sprinted after the duo, they sunk deeper into 
the warehouse, Darred laughing and Aura screaming for her friend. The 
door shut&#151;boom&#151;and the fires sunk into the deadly sticks of 
trinitrotoluene.

Not even the psychic Marissa had time to react as the entire building 
burned up in a massive conflagration.

Her reflexes enabled him to use a mental shield to protect her body as 
she ducked down and dodged the brunt of the blast, but the sheer power 
of the great explosion sent her flying backwards. Wainright rolled and 
tumbled in the dirt, her whole body black with soot and part of it red 
from burns. She kept rolling despite the small injuries, and kept her 
shield around her, hoping its thick design would protect her from the 
holocaust. She stumbled past Xianq, Sanaa, and Kailin, who caught her as 
she came by. An immense fireball shot out into the sky, turning the air 
dark and the world into orange heat.

The warehouse, and anything inside of it, was gone.

Marissa Wainright, badly burnt and bruised, sat there in a numb stupor 
as she watched the remains of the warehouse burn up. The only thing she 
could do was scream.

&quot;NO!!!!! AAAAAAAAAUUUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!! 
AAAAAAAAUUUUUURRRRRRRRRAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!!&quot;

As falling chunks of debris and flame fell down from the sky, Marissa 
crumbled into a defeated ball, every bit of strength and will in her 
body sapped utterly. She screamed and wailed as a piece of her own self, 
her own soul, was ripped apart from her and sent into the very fires of 
Hell. Xianq and Kailin stood gawking at what they had seen; beneath 
them, Marissa covered her head with her arms and fell to the floor, 
where Sanaa came to her and held her as tenderly as she could, her own 
body shaken. The fires continued to burn and the smoke rose higher up 
into the air, until it clouded the area in dreadful darkness.</pre>
