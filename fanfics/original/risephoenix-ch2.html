<h1>Rival Rage 2x: Rise of the Phoenix (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/risephoenix-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;She did what?!&quot;

Kaira let her brown and blonde hair fall softly before her eyes. It was 
no secret that she was terrified of Yuki&#146;s reaction to what Motoko had 
said to her. Kaira couldn&#146;t believe it herself. Never before had Motoko 
forced herself on the gentle girl. And Kaira would have never predicted 
something like that. But it happened. And, considering their undying 
friendship, Kaira could not keep this a secret for long. So Kaira told 
her, just as the two stood in front of the steel metal gates of Hajime 
Seimei School. Kuragama Yuki&#146;s normally peaceful ice blue eyes were 
tinged with anger, her face contorting into images of confusion and 
utter disbelief. Before she even continued; Yuki grabbed Kaira by the 
arm and led her around the long path of gates that surrounded the 
school. This took to them to a different section of the school. Cut off 
and isolated from the rest of it. Which gave more room for Kaira and 
Yuki to talk. The last thing either of them wanted was for someone else 
to hear about this. 

Yuki released Kaira&#146;s arm, saying, &quot;...Are you sure about this, Kaira!? 
Did Motoko really... force herself on you?!&quot; 

&quot;Yes...&quot; Kaira didn&#146;t want to think about it as it was, &quot;she did. She... 
caught me behind Tomi Tomi Cake Shop and told me that she&#146;d make my life 
&#145;difficult&#146; if I didn&#146;t &#145;choose&#146; her. I didn&#146;t want to tell you... but 
you know I can&#146;t keep anything from you, Yuki...&quot;

And Yuki would have been pleased for that admission if not for the 
situation behind the admission. The fact that Motoko would actually try 
and force her grubby hands on sweet, innocent Kaira. Oh, the very idea 
just drove Yuki insane. For the first time since her father had gone out 
of his way to teach her the family fighting style... (Saigo jihi iegara) 
for the first time... she had an urge to use that power as ruthlessly as 
possible. 

&quot;I&#146;m going to kill her,&quot; Though someone else would have taken that as a 
jovial shout of Yuki&#146;s anger; Kaira knew full well that Yuki was 
serious. And very much capable, &quot;I swear to Kami-sama, I&#146;m going to kill 
her.&quot;

&quot;Stop!&quot; Kaira grabbed Yuki&#146;s arm sharply, before she could leave, 
&quot;Please don&#146;t do anything stupid, Yuki! You&#146;ll get into trouble if you 
do!&quot;

Yuki looked back at the girl, scowling, &quot;You think I can let her get 
away with that?! Just the thought of her touching you like that...&quot; 
Yuki&#146;s flesh visibly crawled, &quot;I won&#146;t let her get away with it! Motoko 
can&#146;t do that to people! Least of all you!&quot;

&quot;...Please...&quot; Tears began appearing at the fragile Kaira&#146;s eyes, 
&quot;...Please, Yuki...&quot;

The grip that Kaira have over Yuki&#146;s arm was tight. But breakable. She 
knew full well that Yuki was one of the toughest fighters in Hajime 
Seimei School. Yuki could have easily broken free of the grasp and 
leave. But she didn&#146;t. Yuki tensed a while, her feminine muscles 
throbbing with will to act but held in place by Kaira&#146;s demands. In time 
her body managed to ease a little. And from that, Kaira knew that Yuki 
had calmed down. Not that she had any real reason to.

The Kuragama girl released a puff of cleansing air. &quot;...Okay. I won&#146;t 
face her.&quot;

&quot;Thank you...&quot; Kaira offered, wiping tears from her eyes.

&quot;But...&quot; Kaira held her breath as Yuki, solid and strong, mouthed 
something sharply, &quot;If she ever happens to try something like that 
again... I won&#146;t hold back. And I&#146;m serious, Kaira. You know I am. I 
can&#146;t allow anyone to hurt you. Not you.&quot;

It was for those reasons that Kaira loved her. Though Yuki&#146;s back was 
turned, Kaira tried her hardest to smile, and wrapped both of her thin, 
girlish arms around Yuki&#146;s waist. Kaira settled her head against the 
back of the Lilac-haired woman, relishing the toned strength of flesh 
she felt beneath that confining outfit. Yuki calmed herself even further 
as that thankful embrace of Kaira&#146;s. If anyone were to have come along 
and see such a thing; they would have had a very hard time imagining 
that they were just friends. And Yuki thought the same. It was why she 
went so hard to protect Kaira. Not just because they were friends. Not 
just because Kaira lacked the strength to protect herself. But because 
she loved this girl more than life itself. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was a tough school-day today. By now the afternoon sun was getting a 
little darker. Soon night would be upon her. But Kaira really wasn&#146;t 
thinking about that. For the most part, all she could think about was 
how lousy this day was. First Motoko made a move on her; pretty much 
throwing her weight around and demanding more from Kaira than she was 
willing to give; then she had to spend the entire day keeping Yuki away 
from Motoko. And that in itself was no easy task. Yuki wasn&#146;t the type 
of girl that you could run rings around. Despite all her feminine charms 
and looks; Yuki Kuragama was as headstrong as any male her own age. And 
keeping her from beating the living hell out of Motoko (one step short 
from killing) took all of Kaira&#146;s innocent wiles to accomplish. She had 
spent all of the school day either keeping Yuki occupied with idle talk 
or leading her away any time Motoko and her crew got near them. And it 
really hadn&#146;t escaped Kaira&#146;s notice that her close contact with Yuki 
was warranting more jealous looks from Motoko. Maybe that was why she 
went as far she did. Even so, nothing could excuse Motoko for what she 
did. But since the day was more or less over; Kaira tried not to think 
too much about it. 

Kaira sighed as she slinked down Izura Street, the road that led down to 
the Phoenix Hill Temple. While she walked alone she nibbled on a pastry 
treat she had picked up at Tomi Tomi Cake Shop on her way here from 
school. She didn&#146;t want to think about this whole situation with Yuki 
and Motoko. Keeping them apart, steering a course between them, it was 
too hard. Maybe what she needed was to spend time with her family. Of 
course, her Grandpa Oburo might not be the best choice...

He ran the Phoenix Hill Temple and opened it to the public seasonally. 
Every once in a while he would also open his fighting school and teach 
his technique to whomever was willing to learn. At the right price. But 
he always ended the classes before anyone learned too much. 
Yatagami-style Japanese Karate was as powerful as it was well known. So 
Oburo taught within limits to those around him. And the old buzzard had 
worked hard at keeping the Phoenix Hill Temple together; especially 
since no one was helping him up until now. But he was getting old and he 
needed an extra hand here and there. And since Kaira and Reina were the 
only ones left in the immediate family, Reina had offered Kaira&#146;s 
services. She didn&#146;t much relish the idea of working and tidying up some 
old shrine but she did care enough about her grandfather to help him 
out. And, if it took her mind of the Yuki-Motoko issue, it was enough 
for her. 

Kaira finished off the little cake she had bought and turned a corner 
around the fence of that surrounded the urban open lot she was walking 
by. Further along that road, right at the bottom, was the temple that 
belonged by right to her Yatagami Family; the Phoenix Hill Temple. 

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Kaira thought to herself, &quot;I actually haven&#146;t seen my grandfather 
in a while. How long has it been? About three months? I guess this visit 
was sort of overdue. Especially since he closed down the Temple last 
season. I suppose I should start visiting him more.&quot;

The young Japanese girl strode down the street and paced over to the 
Phoenix Hill Temple. Before she knew it; Kaira was walking along the 
firm hundred stone steps that led up to the temple precinct. It was 
quiet. Aside from the odd &#145;caw&#146; from one of the crows or the rolling of 
the winds, the whole temple seemed more quiet than usual. Kaira looked 
from one side to the other; her sweet blue eyes hoping to get a glimpse 
of her grandfather. Where was he?

&quot;Grandpa?&quot; Kaira called to him, &quot;Where are you? It&#146;s me, Kaira.&quot;

At that point, Kaira froze as she felt a finger poke her in the small of 
her back. The girl soon jumped in fear and leapt forwards, turning 
around with a chilled look in her eye. But her frightened gaze soon 
eased as she saw her grandfather himself, Oburo Yatagami. The short old 
man grinned at the younger, taller girl with a cheerful and knowing 
smile. 

Kaira caught her breath. &quot;...Oh, Grandpa, don&#146;t scare me like that...&quot;

&quot;Eh, heh, heh, heh!&quot; The old man&#146;s wrinkled face creased with laughter, 
&quot;Letting your guard down like that is a very poor idea, Kaira! In this 
world, if you are not careful, someone will use that weakness of form to 
capitalize on your defencelessness. You must always be alert.&quot;

For a brief minute there, Kaira had almost forgotten just how eccentric 
her grandfather really was. &quot;...Grandpa, you talk about it like it&#146;s a 
life or death situation. I&#146;m not learning to be a martial artist or 
anything. I&#146;d be happy to keep away from all that.&quot;

Oburo blinked in confusion. &quot;Hold on a moment. Didn&#146;t that daughter of 
mine tell you what you would be doing with me today?&quot;

&quot;She told me that I had help you take care of the Shrine.&quot; Kaira 
answered. 

The old man of the Phoenix Hill Temple lowered his head and gave a 
sneaky chuckle. &quot;Oh well. I see that your Mother has a firm application 
when it comes to feminine wiles. Just as she always has.&quot;

&quot;Well what does that mean?&quot; Kaira asked.

Oburo grinned then turned his back to Kaira. He walked forwards over the 
thick flagstones of the Temple Precinct and stopped just a few paces 
short of the steps down to the main road below. He turned back, saying, 
&quot;It&#146;s simple, my dear grandchild. You have no need to help me take care 
of the Shrine. No matter what your Mother thinks, I&#146;m in the prime of 
life. No. What I need from you is different. What I need is...&quot;

Kaira tried to nudge him along. &quot;...Yes...?&quot;

&quot;I need...&quot; Oburo grinned again, &quot;...A successor.&quot;

And that could not have been more confusing. &quot;...Hold on a second. You 
want me to be your successor? And just what exactly do you mean by that, 
Grandpa?&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m getting old, Kaira,&quot; Oburo answered, &quot;I feel fit as a fiddle but 
even my ageless bones can&#146;t last forever. This Temple must been carried 
into the future. Along with its 1000 year history and its trademarked 
Yatagami Fighting Style You are the only one left in the Yatagami Family 
who can do this.&quot;

Kaira was, quite frankly, shocked. &quot;Y-You want me to take over after 
you...?&quot;

&quot;After I die, yes,&quot; Oburo said, &quot;I want you to run the Temple in the 
name of the Yatagami. I will teach you the Yatagami-Style. So that you 
may pass it down to future generations of our family.&quot;

She took the time to think about it. Take over the Phoenix Hill Temple? 
It was a huge place. And their family&#146;s fighting style was a big 
responsibility. How could she handle something like that on her own? She 
had no brothers or sisters, her mother was a modern working woman and 
had no time for Shrine duties. Her Father was an American diplomat and 
spent less than a couple of weeks in Japan each year. Who else was 
there? But if she had known all along, why didn&#146;t her Mother say 
anything? How ironic was this? Kaira had thought that coming to the 
Phoenix Hill Temple might help her clear her mind. And in fact all it 
had done was add even more stress to her shoulders. 

Kaira exhaled, her shoulders sagging. &quot;...I don&#146;t have much choice in 
the matter, do I...?&quot;

Oburo grinned that the young woman. &quot;I don&#146;t think you do. Now! It&#146;s 
time we prepared for your training! Which was long overdue in my 
opinion. I have a fresh Gi ready for you in the training hall. Go get 
dressed and we will being.&quot;

Now it was all happening so fast. Kaira lowered her book bag and slinked 
towards the Main Temple building in the centre of the courtyard. But it 
was true... she had no choice in the matter. The Temple and the Fighting 
Style needed to be continued. And that continuation meant a lot to her 
grandfather. Maybe this was the right way forward. Even if it was 
something that she couldn&#146;t quite cope with at once. The young girl 
strode up the smaller set of steps to the main hall. She slid the 
wooden-paper door to one side then walked inside, which was the main 
training hall. Nice and spacious, polished pine floorboards, scrolls 
mounted on the walls and kendo sticks hanging next to them. Kaira could 
only imagine what her grandfather would do with those. 
&#145;Kaira...&#146; 

But there was something else in that room that caught Kaira&#146;s eye...

&#145;Kaira...&#146; 

The Japanese woman looked over at the table towards the back of the 
room. On that wooden table was something. A statue. A stone one. Shaped 
like a bird that was wrapped in hot fire. Kaira&#146;s eyes locked with it. 
They were called to it. Like something was... calling her.

&#145;Kaira...&#146; 

The girl stayed in place. Watching this statue. Feeling something... 
draw her to it. It was a weird and abrupt feeling that Kaira was 
experiencing. All she could think of was that statue sitting on the 
table. What... did this mean? 

&#145;Kaira...&#146; 

She walked forwards. Something was calling to her. Like a wisp of a 
voice in the shades of the mist. Kaira stepped ahead, one foot after the 
other, treading ahead until she was standing before the table. In front 
of the statue. The Statue of the Phoenix. The voice was now vivid. 
Blunt. Inescapable. She had to act on it. Kaira&#146;s hand reached for it. 
To touch it. And before she knew it... the Phoenix Statue was tumbling 
backwards from the table to the ground. Kaira&#146;s daze faded as she heard 
that shattering sound of the statue as it broke upon the floorboards of 
the main hall. 

Kaira blinked and looked at the shards. &quot;W-What... was I doing...?&quot;

And for a few seconds nothing happened. But just as peace returned, it 
vanished. Sparks flickered around the shards of the statue and those 
flickers burst into flames. Large flames reared up in front of Kaira and 
loomed over her. Kaira was stunned, standing there being enveloped by 
its glow. What was happening here? The flames soon took shape, forming 
into a visage of a bird. Two wings shot from either side of the image. 
The top of the set of the flames took on the shape of a head. One that 
possessed a beak and two eyes. But unlike the rest of that flaming 
image, the eyes were very much real. Not made of flame. A pair of golden 
eyes that leered at the horrified Kaira. Their eyes met for the first 
time. They held each other by eyesight. And though she was terrified by 
what she was seeing, Kaira could hear something else. What she knew to 
be its voice.

...The voice of the Phoenix. 

&quot;Kaira...&quot; It spoke femininity and warmth, &quot;...Please don&#146;t be 
frightened. Don&#146;t be alarmed. I may frighten you now... but it was 
destiny that brought us together. We were bound to each other from the 
moment of our births. Fate has tied us as one. And now... we must 
finally live as one...&quot;

Kaira&#146;s chocolate brown eyes still brimmed with fear. &quot;W-What a-are 
you... t-talking about...?&quot;

Nothing more was said by the Phoenix. Its flames burst open again with 
fresh new glow and curled into itself. The flames circled around and 
around until it compressed itself into a smaller cluster of fire. And 
that fire lunged straight into Kaira&#146;s chest. The timid sixteen year old 
screamed as the Phoenix cleaved its way inside her spirit; fusing with 
her. Her mouth hung open and her eyes widened, just before they both 
slammed shut. Once the flames fused instantly with the girl, nothing was 
left. Nothing to signify that any of it had happened. But Kaira was too 
alarmed but what she had experienced to even notice. She slowly tumbled 
to the ground, fainting.

All was left quiet. 

&quot;My name is Jann Mei...&quot; But it spoke again, inside the body and spirit 
of the unconscious Kaira, &quot;...And now we are as one...&quot;
