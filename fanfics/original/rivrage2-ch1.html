<pre>I&#39;ve felt the hate rise up in me...  

Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...  

I wander over where you can&#39;t see...  

Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...  

 

Goodbye!  

 

I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time  

Everything is 3D blasphemy  

My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up  

This is not the way I pictured me  

I can&#39;t control my shakes  

How the hell did I get here?  

Something about this, so very wrong...  

I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn&#39;t like this  

Is it a dream or a memory?  

 

I&#39;ve felt the hate rise up in me...  

Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves...  

I wander over where you can&#39;t see...  

Inside my shell, I wait and bleed...

I swear... if it takes all my strength...

********** 

Ayane Yosukube&#39;s room.  

To all who knew her, Ayane was quite a &#39;personal-person&#39; (so to speak), 
reserved and private. Her room was a safe house for tired body, all her 
worries and all her joys. It was similar to her heart in a way. A place 
she once believed no one else had entry to. But that all changed. There 
was someone in this world that truly held the heart of the Spring 
Breeze Assassin leader.  

This was Rinako Ikatsuji.  

Ayane smiled delicately, savouring this moment. In her room, in her 
bed, in her arms, was the sleeping form of Rinako Ikatsuji, half 
dressed in a loose t-shirt tenuously clinging to her sylvan 
goddess-like body. Though Rinako was asleep, Ayane was wide away, 
watching her private &#39;Izanami&#39; rest in her dreams. The last three 
months had been tough on them both. Ever since that vicious encounter 
with the Kyoto New Force Strikers, Shizuku, Ranji and Zanga. Shortly 
after their defeat, the three of them returned to Kyoto-Central, and 
had never been seen again since. But it wasn&#39;t those guys that bothered 
Ayane the most. It was Rinako&#39;s actions on that day.  

Ayane could vividly picture that cold, demonic look in Rinako&#39;s usually 
warm brown eyes. It was unlike her to be so violent, so ruthless. 
Though that form she assumed did not last long. Almost as quickly as 
she appeared, that Dark Rinako subsided and gave way to the old Rinako. 
The Rinako whom Ayane fell in love with.  

But since then, Rinako had been acting normally. The explanation that 
Natsumi gave, some craziness about a possessive demon, was originally 
looked on with casual humour, but Ayane had to admit that it made 
sense. How else could they explain Rinako&#39;s sudden change in behaviour? 
Still, that was behind them now. Rinako was perfectly fine at present 
and their wishes to cement peace talks between the Cross Blade Lancers 
and the Spring Breeze Assassins were shaping up into a reality. Though 
it had been a struggle on both sides, Rinako and Ayane had convinced 
their respective gangs to drop their hatreds for each other and talk 
this out. Once the Cross Blade Lancers and the Spring Breeze Assassins 
joined forces, Tomeishuu High would be under no threat from outsiders. 
Which was important now, because Tomeishuu High&#39;s old rivals were 
popping out of the woodworks again.  

Tengoku Aijin School.  

For many years, all boy school of Tengoku Aijin had been a great rival 
to Tomeishuu High. This rivalry had been downplayed in the recent two 
years, Tomeishuu&#39;s internal unrest between the CBL and the SBA 
(heightened by Ayane and Rinako&#39;s misguided feelings) was a major 
reason, others were that the exams were taking place inside Tengoku 
Aijin. It was common knowledge that the TA boys were taxed to their 
limits in academic success. Also, there was much contest for the 
position of leader in TA&#39;s main gang, the Tengoku Dream Rebels. Two 
highly skilled candidates, Takami Kozue, and Keitarou Kusako. Aside 
from the leadership queries, most of Tengoku Aijin&#39;s problems had been 
sorted out. Now they were ready to re-ignite the flame of animosity 
between themselves and Tomeishuu High once more.  

Thusly, it was very important that Tomeishuu&#39;s inner conflict came to 
an end. Since the Cross Blade Lancers were the chief gang in Tomeishuu, 
there was no way Rinako and the CBL could handle the Tengoku Dream 
Rebels by themselves. But anyways, all of that could be sorted out in 
the future. For now, Ayane was content to stay here with Rinako in her 
arms.  

Just then, Rinako stirred a little, her eyes fluttering open. With a 
relaxed smile, the CBL leader shifted around in Ayane&#39;s arms to get a 
morning kiss from her love. Ayane instantly smiled as Rinako gave her a 
quick peck on the lips, the brown-eyed girl wrapping her own hug around 
the Yosukube woman.  

&quot;Morning.&quot; Rinako said, her voice slightly throaty from sleep. &quot;Did you 
sleep well?&quot;

Ayane smiled again. &quot;How could I not? Look who&#39;s in bed with me.&quot; 

Rinako almost forgot that this was Ayane&#39;s room. She had snuck in here 
last night to just quickly see Ayane for a short while, and some how 
they had ended up falling asleep together. Though she never intended to 
spend the night, Rinako was glad she slept over.  

&quot;I wish we could do this more often.&quot; She admitted, pulling the stray 
strands of her from her face. &quot;I always find myself missing you when I 
go to sleep at night.&quot; 

Ayane tightened her hug around Rinako&#39;s waist. &quot;So why do you not come 
around here more often? Nobody ever visits me at night, and it is... 
lonely in here sometimes.&quot; 

Rinako couldn&#39;t imagine Ayane sounding any sweeter. &quot;I wish I could. 
Really I do. But you know it&#39;s never safe. Not until we sort out this 
peace agreement. And then there&#39;s Minato...&quot; 

Ayane nodded. After the battle with Zanga and the KNFS, Rinako, Ayane, 
Mishizu, Natsumi, Minato and Izumi had formed a sort of secretive 
friendship between themselves. Of course, there were still some of the 
usual discrepancies, Ayane and Mishizu still didn&#39;t like each other 
much, same with Rinako and Izumi, but they did manage to put up with 
each other for the sake of the group. Because of this new bond, Ayane 
was more aware of the situations going on with Rinako and Minato. And 
she also knew that Minato was missing Natsumi a great deal.  

Natsumi had left just yesterday to visit her family in Osaka, back in 
the Yakume Shrine. She had been planning the visit for a while, but 
Natsumi was in no way looking forward to it. She had grown attached to 
Tomeishuu High, just like all others who had the privilege to enrol 
there. And even though it was just a visit, Minato had been missing 
Natsumi a lot. Rinako felt that she had to be there for her sister now, 
it was important to keep Minato&#39;s bright smile on her face.  

&quot;She is missing Natsumi, huh?&quot; Ayane shifted a little. &quot;I understand 
that, it is not easy when something keeps you apart from your 
girlfriend. We should know that by now, shouldn&#39;t we?&quot; 

Rinako chuckled a little. &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right about that. We have a 
little more experience than most in that area. But we got there in the 
end... and once the CBL-SBA war is over, we won&#39;t have to hide what we 
feel anymore.&quot; 

********** 

Early morning Tokyo.  

This was a very silent time in the usually bustling city. It was a time 
where businessmen, workers and consumers prepared for the day ahead. 
But not only this... it was also a time where battles were fought in a 
certain school. A school that house many powerful fighters.  

And this school was known as Tengoku Aijin.  

Unlike the Victorian design of Tomeishuu High, TA was of a stern modern 
nature. There were no cherry blossom trees or water ponds crested with 
6-foot statues, rather there were un-orderly bike racks and surrounding 
stonewalls un-chiselled by age. The main building was sleek and 
contemporary, fine grey brick spilt apart in sections by panes of clear 
double-glazing. The surrounding buildings were interlocked to the main 
building by small corridors, in a sort of veranda-like design. Tengoku 
Aijin was nothing out of the ordinary; it was just the kind of school 
you&#39;d expect to find in Tokyo of the later 90&#39;s.  

Round at the back of the school, there was a large grass field, TA was 
known for its great successes in sporting events. Large oak trees that 
gave the grounds cover from the main site surrounded this grassy field. 
Which was fortunate, because a battle was taking place. Or, it had just 
taken place, leaving behind the victor and the defeated.  

There were four people around the battle sight; two of them were 
particularly noteworthy. Both on one side, the side of the winner, were 
these two young men. One was known as Yuji Nijuurou. Yuji was 17, 
around 5&#39;6&#39; in height, with a thin build. His thick, yet short black 
hair cascaded gently over his scorching baby blue eyes, his gentle, shy 
smile completely the opposite of what you&#39;d expect from a gang member. 
His stunning intelligence and his feminine looks gave him an edge over 
most, although he was not a martial artist himself. Yuji was the eye of 
most girls in his area, though he had eyes for none of them. 

Yuji was what you might call a...&#39;Bishounen&#39; type of guy.  

The young man next to him was very much an opposite of Yuji. This was 
Danjuro Fushige. 18 years of age, 6&#39; in height, tanned skin, muscular 
build and a short temper. His long ponytail of dark green hair flocked 
over his shoulder in the chilling morning breeze, his confident smile 
accentuated by the equally confident glare of his dark brown eyes. 
Unlike Yuji, he *was* a martial artist, and a beginner in the Minami-oh 
style generously taught to him by his late grandfather, Yoshikuki 
Fushige. Danjuro was also a notorious fan of the beautiful Nagi of Last 
Bronx fame. You messed with her, you messed with Danjuro.  

But the real eye catcher here was one of the two young men whose battle 
had just been decided. This boy was aged 17, slightly taller than Yuji 
but a little shorter than Danjuro. His hair was bright, almost golden 
blonde, with three thick bangs overlapping his vivid face, obscuring 
one of his hauntingly dark blue eyes. His body was built strong without 
muscles, with lissom limbs that could effortless carry out the commands 
given to them by his battle-calculating brain. Though this young man 
was not an academic marvel like Yuji, he was a general in fighting. And 
his cheerful and caring yet serious nature gave this man the ability to 
see all situations from all angles.  

This man was known as Keitarou Kusako.  

Keitarou&#39;s sapphire jewel eyes looked down at the defeated half of the 
battle was just in. That boy was Takami Kozue. The leader of the 
Tengoku Dream Rebels. Or rather, the former leader. With his defeat 
came the exchange of power. This contest was for the leadership of the 
TDR... the whole gang was now in the control of Keitarou.  

Keitarou knelt over and offered Takami a hand up. &quot;Good fight, Kozue. 
You need a hand?&quot; 

Takami narrowed his eyes. &quot;Look after the Dream Rebels. They&#39;re in your 
hands now.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Keitarou said in earnest. &quot;I&#39;ll be doing my best.&quot; 

********** 

{Arggh!} 

Izumi growled fiercely as she chewed on her 8 HB pencil. Those blasted 
History essays were driving her crazy. Normally she would have asked 
Ayane for help, but she was probably still asleep now, it&#39;d be rude to 
disturb her. But curse it all, Izumi couldn&#39;t handle this stuff. Why&#39;d 
they have to learn about the past anyways? Its just a time gone by that 
was more or less unimportant. And 1940-50&#39;s Germany was not the best of 
times, either. Last thing Izumi needed was to make herself depressed by 
reading about it.  

The Spring Breeze Assassin girl was currently in a secluded booth of 
Tomeishuu High&#39;s library, sitting at a desk, hunched over a five-inch 
thick History book. There was going to be an important test in history 
in a short while, maybe a few weeks time. Izumi knew that she really 
had to pass this thing. She was already behind due to her lacking in 
other subjects; if she flopped History then she would fail the whole 
year. And Kami-sama knows her mother Motori would not be happy with 
that.  

Izumi sighed and shut the book. She really didn&#39;t want to have to do 
this now, no matter how significant it was. Not that she really took 
any notice of that either. Izumi was much more concerned with the 
outcome of these peace talks with the Cross Blade Lancers. She knew 
this was the right way forward and everything, but she was worried 
about how this would go down. The Cross Blade Lancer and the Spring 
Breeze Assassin gangs had been enemies long before Ayane and Rinako had 
shown up. And fighting between them had been ferocious in these recent 
two years. Could they all put that behind them and get along in the 
long run? There was a lot of history between them...  

{Geh.} Izumi thought. {I trust Ayane&#39;s judgement enough to know that 
this is the right thing to do. Even if its her love for Rinako talking. 
I just hope she&#39;s prepared for these talks to fail...} 

Just as Izumi was thinking this, a beautiful sight for sore eyes graced 
her. It was Mishizu Yakagi. Over at the other side of the library, at 
the main desk, requesting to withdraw a few books. Izumi sighed 
innocently from seeing her. Though her crush on Mishizu had lasted for 
nearly three years, it had never gotten weaker. It was now safe to 
assume that she was in love. And even though it took her a while, 
Mishizu had managed to get over her feelings for Rinako. And it had 
made her a happier person; you could see it in her eyes. Izumi was 
thankful for that. Not just because it gave her a chance with Mishizu 
but also because it meant that Mishizu would never have to suffer like 
that again.  

However, right at this moment, Izumi was not interested in Mishizu&#39;s 
love. Just her brains.  

&quot;Yo, Mishizu!&quot; She yelled. &quot;Over here!&quot; 

At the reception desk of the Tomeishuu Library, the beautiful Mishizu 
peered over her shoulder to see Izumi calling out to her from across 
the room. And a tiny blush appeared on her cheeks. Things had been very 
different for the two of them lately. Since she, Izumi, Rinako, Minato, 
Natsumi and Rinako had SBA the Tomeishuu Library, the beautiful Mishizu 
peered over her forged this quiet group friendship of there&#39;s, the 
situation between herself and Izumi had changed. No longer did they 
look at each other as rivals. They were friends. And for Mishizu, there 
was a growing attraction. The genius could not explain it, at all, but 
there was something about Izumi that she had never noticed before. 
There was a layer of courage and (slight) honour under that sneaky skin 
of hers. And it was driving Mishizu crazy, especially in recent weeks. 
The only problem was, Mishizu was very unwilling to open up these new 
revelations. Even to Rinako. She was glad that had finally gotten over 
her feelings for Rinako but... Izumi was different somehow. Somehow 
Mishizu knew that Izumi was right for her. After all, Izumi was the 
only person that had managed to suss out Mishizu&#39;s crush on Rinako...  

After handing the desk librarian her card, Mishizu walked over to the 
private booth that Izumi was sitting at. Since this way the early 
morning there was not much chance of any other CBL or SBA girls seeing 
this. None the less, Mishizu was still cautious. The diamond-eyed girl 
nodded politely to Izumi as they came before one and other.  

&quot;Good morning... Izumi.&quot; She said quietly.  

Izumi sighed and rolled open her history book. &quot;Hey. Could you help me 
out here? I know how good you are with this stuff, so would you throw 
me a bone here?&quot; 

Mishizu&#39;s eyebrow rose. &quot;You yelled out across a library just so I 
could help you out...?&quot;  

&quot;Well, yeah, what else would I call you out for? So will you do it? Or 
am I forced to tell my mother about the forthcoming &#39;F&#39; I&#39;ll receive 
from Nakamura-san?&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; Mishizu sighed in defeat. Somehow she knew that Izumi was going 
to tall her into this anyway. &quot;I will help you. So what is Nakamura 
teaching you?&quot; 

Izumi&#39;s dark eyes floated back to her book. &quot;Weeeeell... it&#39;s about 
Germany in the 1940&#39;s and 1950&#39;s. Pre and Post war Germany. But it&#39;s 
all so... boring, I just can&#39;t take it all in. Could you help me out 
here...?&quot; 

Mishizu scowled at Izumi. &quot;Boring? Are you insane? This is one of the 
most fascinating eras in all of the world&#39;s history. You should count 
yourself lucky that Nakamura-san lets you study this. My H-class deals 
in the correlation of political intrigue and social aspects of the 
Asuka-Nara period of Pre-Edo Japan. What you have is a cakewalk 
compared to that. Okay, lets try this out. First off, what were the 
exact years that you were given to study?&quot; 

Izumi thought for a second. &quot;Um... 1941 to 1958... I think.&quot; 

&quot;Okay then, I think I can help you out. First of all, what do you think 
is the key link between social...?&quot; 

With her cheeks nestled closely against her palms, Izumi just smiled 
dreamily and watched her angel go on her tirade of knowledge. This was 
all she could hope for in the world. So see Mishizu acting normally for 
once.</pre>
