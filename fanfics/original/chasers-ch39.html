<a href="../original/chasers-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>Later that afternoon Gwen Musashi sighed to herself
softly, shutting down her desk screen after reading
the rest of her messages. &#39;It looks like I&#39;m going to
have to give up on the idea of bringing in outside
help,&#39; the elegantly dressed Asian woman thought, &#39;at
least officially.&#39;

After several emails the chief of police had formally
put his foot down on the idea of using any ex-army
sweepers to assist them in the hunt for the rogue band
of recon androids, and she had reluctantly given in to
him. Officially she was forbidden to hire out, though
he had also been careful not to explicitly forbid her
from doing so unofficially.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Gwen thought bitterly as she got up, &#39;it
also leaves him free to hang me out to dry if it does
blow up on our face.&#39; Trying not to think about that
she left her office and walked into the computer
section, feeling an odd moment of confusion as she saw
Julie sitting in the computer center where Beth
usually worked.

&quot;Hello captain,&quot; Julie smiled, her black hair tied
back in a simple ponytail.

&quot;Any problems?&quot; Gwen asked calmly.

&quot;Not yet ma&#39;am,&quot; Julie answered seriously after double
checking the screens of data that surrounded her,
&quot;there are just the usual pro-android protests going
on over at City Hall, as well as another small riot in
Lowtown.&quot;

Gwen frowned slightly on hearing about the latest
riot. Things seemed to be deteriorating quickly in the
city&#39;s poorest region, a surprising degree of
militancy arising in the lower class citizens. Making
things even more complicated was the mix of humans and
androids who were participating in the protests and
violence, complicating an already difficult situation.

&quot;Were there any prominent faces in the media
coverage?&quot; Gwen asked her with a degree of concern
while walking closer to the data center.

Julie looked a little sheepish. &quot;Facial recognition
software picked up Dr. Alexis Jameson,&quot; she reported a
bit nervously.

Gwen winced a bit on hearing her former girlfriend&#39;s
name before shaking her head slightly. &quot;Were any of
the known movement leaders there?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; Julie shook her head, &quot;and they&#39;ve bee
very careful to keep the highest levels of their
organization secret.&quot;

&quot;Not surprising,&quot; Gwen conceded. &quot;Any messages?&quot;

&quot;Beth did check in from headquarters,&quot; Julie said and
felt a bit surprised to see Gwen brighten up a bit on
hearing that.

&quot;What did she say?&quot; Gwen asked with a smile.

&quot;The security systems for the headquarters computers
are, and I quote, more full of holes than Swiss
cheese,&quot; Julie said with a degree of amusement.

Gwen fought to contain a flash of annoyance. They had
both known there were problems already, that was why
Beth was looking into it, but she hadn&#39;t thought it
was this bad. &quot;Is she going to need more time?&quot; she
asked, bracing for the worst.

&quot;Not from the message she left,&quot; Julie answered
crisply, &quot;she&#39;s going to detail the problems in her
report and fix what she can before coming home.&quot;

&quot;Notify me when she checks in again,&quot; Gwen said,
turning to return to her office.

&#39;What was that all about?&#39; Julie wondered.

There was a sound from the lift and in a few moments
Kate and Jen appeared, hauling a very much alive and
mostly naked female android. &quot;Come on,&quot; Kate growled,
the sandy haired woman tugging her forward with
surprising gentleness.

Jen followed with a amused look on her face, her
cheeks faintly red. &quot;Well that was a first,&quot; the tall
blonde murmured.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Julie called, looking curiously at the
redheaded android. She was wearing what was left of a
waitress outfit, her top gone to reveal full, bouncy
breasts and the bottom only covered by a tattered
apron.

&quot;How may I serve you?&quot; the android asked, batting her
eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t answer that,&quot; Kate chuckled, hauling her
forward, &quot;you might regret it.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Julie blinked.

&quot;You know that flasher we heard about in the financial
district?&quot; Jen asked wryly. &quot;We got a sighting report
and headed out to look....&quot;



The police car swerved violently, zipping through
traffic in a manner that could best be called
reckless. &quot;Now where was the sighting?&#39; Kate turned to
look at Jen and away from the road ahead.

&quot;Eyes on the road!&quot; Jen squeaked, holding on to the
dashboard with a white knuckled grip.

&quot;The other cars are all on autodrive, they&#39;ll dodge us
on their own,&quot; Kate said, but she still turned her
eyes back to the road.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen puffed out a breath as she examined
the map displayed by the poor car&#39;s computer. &quot;We&#39;re
nearly there,&quot; she reported. Kate yanked the wheel to
the side and slipped them through the gap between
cars, so close that Jen almost expected to hear metal
scrape.

The sound of a beep from the computer let them know
they had officially reached the area and Kate grinned.
&quot;Here we go,&quot; she swerved across two lanes of traffic,
inspiring horns and squealing tires before she bumped
them right up on the sidewalk and stopped just short
of a wall.

Jen peeled her fingers free of the dashboard and got
out on shaky legs. &quot;After riding along with you,&quot; she
remarked, &quot;death has no fear to me.&quot;

&quot;Wuss,&quot; Kate chuckled as she looked around, the sun
peeking through the great towers all around them. On
the trip from police headquarters they had steadily
ascended, rising up through the levels until they
reached sunlight and the areas of the wealthy.

Slipping a police issue visor on she brought up the
heads up display, scanning the people that moved along
the sidewalks nearby. Androids were tagged by the
sensors, outlined by a halo of orange as the normal
humans walked on, mostly unaware. &quot;Wonder where she
is?&quot; Jen murmured.

Kate pulled a battered, old fashioned notebook out and
flipped over to a fresh sheet where a address was
written out, &quot;The report said it was the Imperitex
tower, entrance at the 150th floor.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t even use a personal comp?&quot; Jen blinked as
the two women set out.

&quot;They&#39;re annoying,&quot; Kate said flatly as they walked
on. Off in the distance they heard a woman scream and
they bolted, running as fast as they could.

&quot;All right,&quot; Jen yelled as they burst into the lobby
on their level, &quot;what&#39;s going on....&quot; They trailed off
in surprise, blinking.

&quot;How may I serve you?&quot; the topless android looked up
to beam at them, her breasts bouncing attractively as
she snuggled with a very appalled looking secretary.
The young woman was struggling to get free, a feat
made all the more difficult by the fact that she
couldn&#39;t push her away without touching at least some
bare flesh.

&quot;I think we found her,&quot; Kate said amusedly.

&quot;Get this thing of me,&quot; the secretary wailed, the
petite little brown haired woman struggling weakly in
the android&#39;s grip.

&quot;Right,&quot; Jen bounced forward, helping haul the busty
girl off the other woman.

&quot;How may I serve you?&#39; she asked Jen curiously,
snuggling close.

&quot;You could let go, for one,&quot; Jen sighed as the two of
them hauled her out of the office building, ignoring
the looks from passerby.

Kate was chuckling softly, noting how the android had
latched on to Jen. &quot;I think she likes you,&quot; she
quipped.

&quot;You&#39;re not helping,&quot; Jen gave her a look while the
android cooed something in her ear.



Julie looked amused as they related the story, helping
the two women haul the android off to the detention
center one floor down. &quot;So did she cause any problems
getting her back here?&quot; she asked them curiously.

&quot;Beyond showing her goodies to anyone we passed, no,&quot;
Kate shrugged, &quot;I suspect Gwen is going to end up with
a few complaints over that.&quot;</pre>
