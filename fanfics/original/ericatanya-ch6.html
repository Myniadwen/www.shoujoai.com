<a href="../original/ericatanya-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>&quot;I still can&#39;t believe that you said that,&quot; Erica chuckled as Tanya 
opened up her apartment door. The black haired woman imitated Marilyn 
Monroe as she quoted Tanya, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Mr. Director but Erica,&quot; a 
deliberate pause, &quot;keeps me very satisfied.&quot;

Tanya chuckled softly as the beautiful blonde swung the door open, &quot;Well 
the lecher wasn&#39;t getting the hint any other way.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s certainly made my reputation,&quot; Erica laughed, her black dress 
jacket slung over her shoulder casually. The boyish woman frowned as she 
continued, &quot;And it kept me from socking that putz when he nearly felt 
you up.&quot;

&quot;I noticed,&quot; Tanya smiled, flipping on the light switch, &quot;and I kind of 
liked it when it looked like you were going to leap to my defense.&quot; She 
waved Erica towards the couch, &quot;Grab a seat while I get into something a 
little more comfortable.&quot;

Erica smiled warmly as she sat down casually, looking Tanya over in the 
strapless little black dress that she was wearing. &quot;It may be 
uncomfortable,&quot; she said to her quietly, &quot;but I think you were the best 
looking girl there tonight.&quot;

Tanya blushed faintly but her smile was warm as she said, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Erica said with a grin. She watched as Tanya walked 
across the room, her hips swaying gently then disappeared into her 
bedroom. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I said that.&#39; she thought, &#39;we aren&#39;t dating, 
no matter how much it feels like we are.&#39; A bit of a blush colored her 
cheeks as she admitted to herself, &#39;Or how much I may want us to.&#39;

Tanya closed the bedroom door, leaning up against it for a moment. 
&quot;Damn, I wish I knew if she meant that,&quot; she sighed softly. Erica 
probably hadn&#39;t intended that compliment to come out that way, or 
realized how warm her gaze made Tanya feel.

She pushed off the door and walked across her bedroom, slipping her 
shoes off then quietly pulling open a dresser drawer. Tanya hesitated, 
looking down at the lingerie and imagining what Erica&#39;s reaction might 
be if she walked out in that. She blushed, her imagination running away 
with her and quickly slid it shut, getting her sweatpants and a T-shirt. 
The dress unsnapped and puddled around her feet as she quickly pulled on 
the shirt and pants.

&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; Tanya walked back out into the living-room, 
her blonde hair a bit messy from changing, the T-shirt draped over her 
generously proportioned body.

Erica quickly turned from where she was looking through the CD rack and 
smiled guiltily, &quot;Sorry, I was snooping.&quot;

Tanya chuckled back in her throat, &quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot; She walked across 
to Erica, standing beside the slightly taller woman, &quot;Do you want to 
pick something?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Erica took one of the CDs out and slipped it into the player, 
the stereo system starting up automatically. Soft Celtic music blended 
with pop began to play, several female voices raised in song as 
&#39;Forgiven, not forgotten&#39; started.

&quot;The Corrs?&quot; Tanya blinked then she smiled warmly, &quot;I almost expected 
you to pick something rock and roll.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just full of surprises,&quot; Erica said, turning to meet Tanya&#39;s bright 
blue eyes with her own dark brown ones.

Tanya&#39;s stomach loudly grumbled into the soft sounds of the music and 
she blushed brightly as she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Considering that our evening of fine dining amounted to one piece of 
chicken, sprig of veggie and a thin sauce I&#39;m feeling a bit peckish, 
too,&quot; Erica admitted.

Tanya chuckled and motioned towards the kitchen as she asked her, &quot;Well, 
do you want to share a snack with me?&quot;

Erica&#39;s own stomach grumbled quietly, too. &quot;Does that answer your 
question?&quot; she asked with a slight blush.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Tanya laughed. They walked into the kitchen and Tanya waved 
Erica to a seat at the table there as she opened up the fridge to peer 
inside. &quot;How would you like a burger?&quot; she asked, entirely unaware of 
the view she was giving Erica.

Erica gulped, Tanya&#39;s rounded bottom pulling the sweatpants tight as she 
bent over. She was so distracted it took her a moment to register the 
question. &quot;A burger would be great,&quot; she managed, &quot;as long as it&#39;s not 
too much trouble.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I have everything pretty much,&quot; Tanya said as she pulled an onion 
and tomatoes out, then opened the freezer to get some frozen beef 
patties out. She started a burner on her stove as she asked, &quot;Do you 
want medium or well-done?&quot;

&quot;I like my beef well done, please,&quot; Erica grinned. &quot;Is there anything I 
can do to help?&quot; she asked as she moved over Tanya&#39;s side.

&quot;How are you at chopping?&quot; Tanya nodded to the onion and tomatoes.

Erica didn&#39;t answer aloud, instead she got the cutting board down from 
where it hung on the wall then grabbed a sharp pointed knife. Smoothly 
she cut into the onion&#39;s outer layer and peeled the rough material away 
then set it down to swiftly cut it into even slices.

&quot;Nice,&quot; Tanya said admiringly even as she flipped the burgers over.

&quot;It was either learn to manage in the kitchen by myself,&quot; Erica took the 
tomato and carefully began to cut, &quot;or live off take-out Chinese.&quot;

Tanya chuckled warmly, &quot;And there&#39;s only so long that you can eat 
take-out before you start to loose your taste for it.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Erica nodded. She carefully stacked the various slices on a 
plate, &quot;But I do have to admit to sticking with bachelor foods, mostly.&quot;

&quot;Bachelor foods?&quot; Tanya looked over at Erica curiously while casually 
flipping the burgers over to avoid any sticking.

&quot;Easy to cook and fast,&quot; Erica smiled ruefully, &quot;I&#39;m an expert on making 
Kraft dinner, instant noodles and TV dinners, for instance.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re ready,&quot; Tanya murmured, getting the package of hamburger buns 
down and pulling one out each. &quot;You really need someone to take care of 
you, Erica,&quot; she laughed, using the spatula to slide one burger on each 
bun..

&quot;What, like a wife?&quot; Erica asked as the two of them loaded up their 
burgers with various toppings from the fridge.

&quot;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d go that far,&quot; Tanya murmured as they carried the 
burgers on little plates over to the table. &quot;Would you like some Cola?&quot; 
she smiled.

&quot;That&#39;d be great,&quot; Erica answered. &quot;So why not a wife?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It does sound a little old-fashioned,&quot; Tanya said as she took two tall 
glasses and filled them. She gave Erica a thoughtful look, &quot;Besides, I 
think you&#39;d rather have a partner.&quot;

&quot;You could be right about that partner thing,&quot; Erica admitted as she got 
up and took the glasses from Tanya before setting them down side by 
side. &quot;Here,&quot; she held out Tanya&#39;s seat as she said, &quot;for the lovely 
cook.&quot;

Tanya sat down, the chair smoothly pushed in behind her. &quot;Why, thank 
you,&quot; she smiled up at Erica, a bit of red to her cheeks.

&quot;Least I could do,&quot; Erica said as she took her seat beside Tanya.

&quot;Oh no,&quot; Tanya shook her head, &quot;I&#39;ve had a few boyfriends and they never 
do that.&quot; She paused, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if they&#39;d even think to.&quot;

Erica stopped, her burger part way to her mouth. &quot;Then they weren&#39;t 
worthy of you,&quot; she said simply before taking a bite with obvious 
enjoyment.

Tanya looked at Erica, blinking in surprise. &quot;That may be the single 
most romantic thing anyone has ever said to me,&quot; she said softly.

Erica felt her cheeks brightening as she met Tanya&#39;s eyes, feeling 
herself almost falling into the blue. &quot;I meant every word,&quot; she said 
simply.

Tanya put her burger down, her hands suddenly weak. &quot;Our dating these 
past few weeks,&quot; she questioned, &quot;it wasn&#39;t all just an act, was it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Erica confessed, her own burger sitting there forgotten as she 
said, &quot;I like you Tanya, maybe more than I should be.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Tanya&#39;s voice dropped to a whisper.

Erica leaned forward, her own voice soft as she said, &quot;You&#39;ve drawn the 
lines pretty clearly, you told me you were straight.&quot;

Tanya closed her eyes, shivering slightly at the feel of Erica&#39;s breath 
on her skin. &quot;When I went to get changed,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I wanted to 
come out in a nightie, not this.&quot;

Erica brought her hand up, resting it on Tanya&#39;s cheek. &quot;I don&#39;t want 
you making a choice you&#39;ll regret later,&quot; she said softly.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; when Tanya opened up her eyes they were clearly determined, 
&quot;there is no way I could regret this.&quot;

&quot;But....&quot; Erica started.

Tanya closed the distance and pressed her lips to Erica&#39;s, silencing any 
other comment. It was awkward for a moment, uncomfortable, then Erica 
shifted a bit, pulling their bodies gently closer as the kiss deepened. 
They slipped apart, Tanya&#39;s breath coming faster as Erica looked at her 
in surprise.

&quot;Is it all right?&quot; Tanya finally asked.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Erica gave her that cocky grin then pulled her into another 
kiss.</pre>
