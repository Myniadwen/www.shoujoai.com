<a href="../original/journend-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Nicole finished getting all the furniture arranged to her liking 
by the evening, the sweat soaking her body. Occasionally she would get 
that sensation of being watched, but after their very short talk back in 
the bedroom the ghost wasn&#39;t making her presence known.

        &quot;There,&quot; Nicole said as she finished the room she considered the 
most important, her office. A comfortable office chair, the old desk, 
her much more recent computer and printer were all set up. The 
bookshelves on one side were still bare, the books stowed away in boxes, 
but she could start with loading them up tomorrow.

        Nicole took a seat, letting her weight settle down on the chair. 
&quot;Not bad,&quot; she murmured, taking in the view of the sea outside her 
window. Once she put up some blinds she could block out that view when 
she needed to concentrate, but for now she just enjoyed the sight.

        Getting up Nicole groaned, feeling her aching muscles pull. 
Moving the furniture around had not been fun, not at all. She stumbled 
to her bedroom to grab a change of clothes and a robe, then walked to 
the bathroom. The perfectly modern shower was warm on her bare skin, 
scrubbing all the sweat of her labors away.

        &quot;Oh,&quot; a soft voice sounded surprised.

        &quot;Aaah!&quot; Nicole whirled around to see the stunned looking Laura 
gazing at her in honest surprise. The turn of the century young woman 
looked almost shocked at Nicole did, actually. Getting her rapid 
heartbeat under control she managed to joke, &quot;I usually don&#39;t share the 
shower with a girl until after the second date.&quot;

        Her eyes as big as saucers as Linda took a step back, thankfully 
passing through the glass door to the shower and out of sight. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; the soft voice came, and even the blurred image of Linda in the 
glass disappeared.

        Scrubbing herself off as quickly as possible Nicole climbed out 
of the shower, drying herself off with a handy towel. It was odd, she 
didn&#39;t really feel angry about it, just kind of bemused. &#39;I wonder if 
she didn&#39;t realize what a shower is for?&#39; she thought, belting the long 
robe around her and wrapping her hair up in a towel.

        Walking through the upper floor she didn&#39;t feel the ghost 
around, so she headed down to the main floor. Walking through the living 
room and parlor she still didn&#39;t find her, so with a soft sigh she went 
into the kitchen. The little place had a warm, homey feel, especially 
after she had unpacked some of the boxes of utensils and stuff. She 
opened up the kitchen cupboards, then the fridge and sighed.

        &quot;Nothing to eat,&quot; Nicole groaned. She hadn&#39;t done any shopping 
on her way up here, and what was stored away wasn&#39;t too appetizing to 
her right now. With a weary sigh she went back upstairs, dressing 
quickly before heading down to the front hall. In jeans, T-shirt and 
jacket she slipped her shoes on and was gone, unaware she was being 
watched.

        Laura stood in the hallway a moment, lost in her thoughts. &#39;Will 
she go away?&#39; she wondered. This place was her home, though over the 
years many others had tried to dwell here beside her. But after a time 
they would leave, leaving her here all alone once again. This woman, 
though, she seemed different somehow.

        A faint blush appeared on the pale cheeks as she thought about 
what she had done. Laura hadn&#39;t quite realized what Nicole was doing 
when she walked in on the redhead earlier, the woman&#39;s bare body beneath 
the cascade of water. She had frozen, admiring that slim form 
unashamedly, until Nicole&#39;s words had jerked her back to awareness.

        &quot;I hope she stays,&quot; Laura finally murmured softly, fading out 
once more.

        The car bounced down the road from the house towards the town, 
and Nicole had to grit her teeth when she hit a pothole. &quot;I really need 
to get someone to fix that,&quot; she muttered as she slid from the long lane 
onto paved roads. Thankfully the trip down to town was fast after that, 
and she found the supermarket in a few moments.

        Searching the market she found some decent looking frozen pizzas 
for dinner, and picked up a few other essentials before heading up to 
the checkouts. She passed by the bookshelves and had to smile slightly, 
seeing the romance paperbacks and spotting her name among them. &#39;As a 
kid I never thought that the words &#39;by Nicole Richards&#39; would be on 
romance novels,&#39; she mused. Still, the royalties paid well and she had 
always found it easy work.

        &quot;At least until recently,&quot; Nicole muttered to herself aloud.

        &quot;Eh?&quot; a woman&#39;s voice inquired.

        Nicole nearly jumped out of her skin. The black haired young 
lady was giving her an amused look, a slight smile on her pretty face. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Nicole managed to get out, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize that I was 
talking aloud.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; the lady laughed softly, &quot;I do that 
occasionally myself.&quot; She offered her hand, &quot;My name&#39;s Jane.&quot;

        &quot;Nicole,&quot; and she intentionally left her last name off. Standing 
here by the paperback racks, it would be pretty funny if she got 
identified as the writer of trashy romances.

        &quot;I haven&#39;t seen you around,&quot; Jane said curiously as they moved 
to the front of the store towards the checkout counters, &quot;did you just 
move here?&quot;

        &quot;Bought the house a few weeks ago,&quot; Nicole admitted as she 
unloaded her cart at the checkout, &quot;but I only just finished unpacking.&quot;

        Jane waited behind her, holding a small basket of groceries. &quot;I 
hadn&#39;t heard of any vacancies in town,&quot; she commented leadingly.

        Nicole noticed with some amusement that the young cashier was 
also listening intently to the conversation. He packed away the 
groceries, but at least some of his attention was on them. &quot;That&#39;s 
because I didn&#39;t move into the town itself,&quot; she said, &quot;I have a little 
place on the edge of town.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Jane encouraged.

        &quot;It&#39;s a nice little place,&quot; Nicole was curious to see their 
reactions as she continued on, &quot;I think it&#39;s called Journey&#39;s End.&quot;

        The cashier nearly dropped one of the pizzas, only Nicole&#39;s 
reflexes keeping the disk from hitting the floor. &quot;Sorry,&quot; he blushed, 
grabbing it from Nicole. He gave her an odd look, &quot;The guy who sold it 
to you, he told you everything about it?&quot;

        &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Nicole said cheerfully.

        Jane looked at her worriedly, &quot;Did he..&quot; she started, then she 
gulped. A breath and she continued, &quot;Did he tell you about the ghost, 
too?&quot;

        Nicole paid, then she picked up her bags of groceries. With a 
cheerful smile she told them, &quot;Yes, he did. I considered it a bonus, 
more or less.&quot; With that she offered them a cheerful, &quot;Have a nice day!&quot; 
At a steady pace she walked out to her car, only then breaking into a 
case of the giggles.

        &quot;The looks on their faces,&quot; Nicole laughed softly as she loaded 
the groceries into the trunk. She rather suspected that she was going to 
be the main topic of gossip in this little town for the next several 
days, but she thought that she could live with that. She went around to 
climb behind the wheel, started up the car and was off.

        The trip up to the house wasn&#39;t quite as bad as the trip down. 
Of course, that was mostly because she was getting used to it, and had 
learned to avoid some of the larger potholes. She pulled in front of the 
house and unloaded the trunk, only pausing to gaze up at the old house a 
moment. There was a flicker of movement in an upper window, then it was 
gone.

        The door opened up under Nicole&#39;s hand, and she blinked in 
surprise as the door swung wide open. She didn&#39;t see anything in the 
hallway, but she could hear a soft voice say, &quot;It looked like you had 
your hands full.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, thank you,&quot; Nicole managed, using her foot to push the door 
shut behind her. She carried the bags of food into the kitchen, her eyes 
searching for any sign of the ghost. It took a few moments of putting 
food away before she felt the presence once again.

        Laura was looking down at one of the frozen pizzas, an 
inquisitive look on the transparent blonde&#39;s face. &quot;Most interesting,&quot; 
she murmured softly. She looked up to give Nicole a tentative smile, &quot;I 
had not intended to interrupt your washing, before.&quot;

        Nicole actually had to fight back a smile. &quot;In all honesty,&quot; she 
looked over at the ghost thoughtfully, &quot;I think you were more 
embarrassed than I was.&quot;

        Laura looked startled, then she laughed softly, &quot;You could be 
right.&quot; She turned, her long gown flowing around her body. For a moment 
she looked so normal, then she walked right through a chair as she 
examined the other groceries on the table.

        &#39;I could get used to this,&#39; Nicole had to smile as she packed 
food away, the ghost watching curiously all the while.

        &quot;You&#39;re not afraid, are you?&quot; Laura finally asked

        Nicole turned from the fridge, meeting her eyes. &quot;No, I&#39;m not. I 
guess you just don&#39;t seem frightening to me,&quot; she shrugged.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Laura said, then she simply faded away.</pre>
