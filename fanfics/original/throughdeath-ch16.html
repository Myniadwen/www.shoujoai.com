<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>      Abby had succumbed to her weariness, no longer having the stamina to stay up and wait 
for Sakura. She was surprised she could fall asleep with her lover missing. She drifted off, 
barely noticing anything around her. At first, everything was fine, but... it didn&#39;t take 
long until she heard the sound. Was it... flapping? Dare she say it, Abby thought there was 
a bird right outside her window.

      There was no chirping... just flapping. Abby buried herself deeper in the covers, 
wanting to sleep, wanting to wake up and see Sakura. The sounds stopped. Abby paid it no 
mind, prepared to go to sleep, but... she felt a hand slip between the covers and caress her 
waist. The young mother let out a happy sigh as it drifted over her clothed form.

      She started to awake as the bed sunk. There were two hands now and Abby had no doubt 
as to whom they belonged to. She cracked her eyes open, but they fluttered shut as an eager 
mouth kissed her exposed nape. &quot;Sakura...&quot; she murmured out, only to be greeted by silence. 
Even with her eyes closed, Abby could imagine the gentle smile on the other woman&#39;s face.

      Sakura climbed on top of her with grace and started to remove Abby&#39;s clothes. The 
blonde soon realized that it was a very naked Sakura on top of her. Just as she was about to 
open her eyes and greet her, Abby was swept up in a passionate kiss. Sakura was in a 
wonderful mood today; she could tell from the emotions pouring into the kiss.

      Their bodies melded together perfectly and Abby&#39;s eyes fluttered open to meet Sakura&#39;s 
own. At first, the woman&#39;s snowy white hair obscured her vision, but... Abby frowned. 
Something wasn&#39;t quite right. Sakura smiling at her, but that wasn&#39;t it. Her normally 
piercing red eyes... were no longer there. Instead, there were silver eyes staring back at 
her.

      Abby was positive she wasn&#39;t going crazy. &quot;Sakura...?&quot; The woman on top of her only 
seemed to smile wider at her confusion. &quot;Yes?&quot; Abby sighed as one hand caressed her face. 
She heard the flapping noise again, but this time, it was much closer. Abby pulled her lover 
down, only to find something on Sakura&#39;s shoulder blades.

      The blonde&#39;s unasked question was answered as two pure white wings came into view, 
feathers falling from them. &quot;You... what happened?&quot; Abby sat up and found herself being 
wrapped up in the pristine wings, feathers rustling against her body. &quot;I&#39;ve been negotiating 
my situation,&quot; Sakura murmured, caressing Abby&#39;s cheek. &quot;I made a different kind of deal so 
you and I... can be together.&quot;

      Sakura laid her head on Abby&#39;s chest. &quot;I... told you before that I didn&#39;t want us to 
be torn apart by time, so I...&quot; The angel blushed. &quot;I exchanged everything - my eyes, my 
armor, my immortality.&quot; Abby looked shocked. &quot;Sakura, you didn&#39;t have to do that and your 
wings... how did this...?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;ve done such a competent job as the Living Inferno that my... superiors... allowed 
me to trade. Now, you and I will always be connected.&quot; Abby didn&#39;t quite understand. 
&quot;That&#39;s... wonderful, but I still don&#39;t get it. How are we going to stay together?&quot; Sakura 
grabbed Abby&#39;s hand and placed it on her chest. &quot;Can you feel it? My heartbeat?&quot;

      Abby nodded and Sakura made the blonde woman feel her own. She was startled when she 
realized that her and Sakura&#39;s hearts beat at the same time. &quot;This way... if one of us 
dies... then we&#39;ll go together.&quot; Abby let it sink in before smiling. &quot;I... wouldn&#39;t have it 
any other way...&quot;

      Sakura gently pushed her back down. Abby was laughing quietly. &quot;That still doesn&#39;t 
explain your wings...&quot; The angel blushed. &quot;You... you said you wanted to feel them, so I got 
them back for you.&quot; Abby ran a hand through one of her wings and Sakura shuddered in 
pleasure.

      &quot;They&#39;re rather sensitive...&quot; The white haired woman whispered, her face flushed. 
&quot;Tell me,&quot; Abby whispered against Sakura&#39;s lips. &quot;Is this all a dream?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry! Mommy will down soon...&quot; Eveon said to her &#39;little&#39; sister. She was 
currently sitting at the table, holding Tycara in her arms. The baby was slightly 
disgruntled without any food in sight, which in this case would be Abby. Everyone else was 
still asleep... Isaka handed Tycara over to Eveon and Mina last night, saying something 
about their special time being interrupted.

      Speaking of Mina, the young girl was asleep in Eveon&#39;s room, snuggling up against the 
sheets. The blonde left her girlfriend behind when she realized that she wasn&#39;t going to get 
up. Mina always said strange things about how nice Eveon&#39;s bed was, so...

      Her musings were cut off when she heard someone coming down the stairs.

      &quot;...they... they&#39;ve gotten bigger...&quot;

      &quot;Really? How can you tell?&quot;

      &quot;...I...I would never forget that part of your body...&quot;

      Eveon was trying hard not to blush. She just had to overhear this conversation. &quot;Yeah, 
but it&#39;s probably because of Tycara.&quot;

      &quot;Hmm... and they&#39;re more sensitive as well...&quot;

      As if on cue, Eveon heard a sharp gasp. Abby came into the kitchen, looking quite 
bashful. &quot;Y-yes, they are...&quot; The young mother tried to regain her composure upon seeing 
both her children in the kitchen. &quot;O-oh! Hi, Eveon, Tycara.&quot; Her baby suddenly reached out, 
grasping the air towards her new mother.

      With a sigh, Abby picked up her little hybrid and sat down. She made a point to turn 
away from Eveon as she started nursing her. Likewise, Eveon made a point to not even look at 
her mother. Which was why she was startled when she saw Sakura.

      &quot;What the crap!&quot; Eveon looked at Abby, soon regretted it and looked back at Sakura. 
The 15 year old was used to seeing Sakura now, but she was definitely surprised to see her 
wings and silver eyes. &quot;Seriously. I thought you were the boogey man, but you ended being 
the grim reaper. I thought you were a guy and you were actually a girl... and now...!&quot;

      Eveon rubbed her eyes tiredly and Abby just snorted. &quot;Oh please, Eveon. You weren&#39;t 
the one who was pleasantly surprised last night.&quot; The young girl made a face. &quot;Thank you 
mommy. I totally wanted to imagine how surprising last night was, seeing as how most of us 
could hear it.&quot;

      Sakura just smiled at their bantering a sat down next to Eveon. The blonde girl sighed 
as the angel started to fiddle with her hair. &quot;This is so weird. I have to mothers and one 
has wings...&quot; Abby finished feeding Tycara and gave Eveon a wicked grin.

      &quot;I can&#39;t wait until parent teacher conferences Eveon... I want to introduce all your 
teachers to your second mother.&quot;

      &quot;Do you exist to embarrass me?!&quot;

      &quot;Hey, that&#39;s what being a mother is all about. Maybe in the future, when science is 
advanced, you and Mina will learn that.&quot;

      &quot;Mommy!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Seeeeeeeeeetttthhhh!!!&quot; The young man had barely gotten into the house when he was 
attacked by a white blur. &quot;Gah!&quot; He caught his attacker and soon found his shirt caught in a 
death grip. &quot;I missed you!&quot; Tycara looked up at him with a bright smile. &quot;It... it&#39;s only 
been a day...&quot; Seth murmured out, picking up the girl.

      &quot;I love you so much Seth! Of course I would miss you!&quot; The young man let out a nervous 
laugh. &quot;That&#39;s really sweet, except you&#39;re only four years old!&quot; A couple of months had 
passed since her birth and Seth was extremely relieved when his girlfriend started to group 
rapidly. &quot;Just you wait,&quot; she said in her childish voice, &quot;I&#39;m going to be a big girl before 
you know it!&quot;

      Seth carried her over to the living room, where Eveon was doing homework with Mina. 
&quot;Oh, hey Seth,&quot; Mina said, laughing slightly at his situation. &quot;I love Tycara to death, but 
this feels really strange...&quot; Seth murmured and Eveon got up to help him. &quot;Come here, 
Tycara. Let me hold you.&quot;

      Tycara shook her head at Eveon and held onto Seth even more. &quot;No, I&#39;ll never let Seth 
go!&quot; Eveon sighed and said, &quot;Sorry, Seth. Looks like Tycara has no qualms with having some 
pedo-love. Tough luck.&quot; He let out a long groan. Where were Abby and Sakura when you needed 
them? 

***** 

      &quot;When I asked if you could fly... I never expected this.&quot; Abby stared at the expanse 
of sky above her, nestled securely in between her lover&#39;s legs. Sakura wrapped her arms 
tighter around Abby, her wings blocking the wind. The blonde woman&#39;s back remained close to 
Sakura&#39;s front as she continued to gaze at the stars.

      &quot;I... wanted to do something special for you.&quot; Abby had asked Sakura earlier if she 
could fly and the angel responded by sweeping her off her feet and into the sky. Abby began 
to kiss Sakura&#39;s fingertips. &quot;So much stuff has happened in less than a year... but I&#39;ve 
found a reason to keep going,&quot; Abby said, looking back into Sakura&#39;s silver eyes.

      &quot;...I don&#39;t think I need to tell you what it is.&quot;

      &quot;...you don&#39;t.&quot;
