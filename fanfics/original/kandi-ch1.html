Verse One: Kandi and the Swimming Instructor 

**********

The phone wasn&#39;t ringing.

It never rang. At least not with the person Kandi wanted on the other 
end of the line. And it frustrated her. You couldn&#39;t have seen it by the 
distracted look on her face, but it was there. The young redhead sighed 
miserably, laying stomach-down on the pink-tinted spread of her bed. In 
her arms was a large stuffed animal Like a panda. Kandi hugged it 
tighter and bounced her bare feet up and down off her pillow idly, 
gazing at the phone on top of her chest of drawers. 

&quot;Janny... you jerk,&quot; Kandi whispered unhappily, &quot;...why haven&#39;t you 
called me? I&#39;m tired of waiting. This is so not cool...&quot;

In her eyes, Kandi reflected a gaze at the phone that was less a stare 
on it and more of a probing into her own mind. She tried to think of 
what possible reason there could be for her little Janny not to call 
her. You see, this town was called Victoria A half-sleepy, half-bustling 
city in the state of Texas. But Kandi wasn&#39;t a Texan by birth. She was 
from South Dakota originally. During her upbringing there, she had 
fallen for a beautiful young cheerleader who was as sexy as she was 
fresh. And that woman was Janelle Campbell. Or &#39;Janny&#39; in Kandi&#39;s heart. 
They had been together for years. Sneaking around behind the backs of 
their friends and family, the two had been &#39;girlfriends&#39; since grade 
school. And their relationship became a sexual one once Kandi and 
Janelle started to mature a little. They were happy with each other 
really. Aside from a few differences in taste of music and food, they 
meshed well as a couple. But that all ended six months ago. It was the 
usual story. Her parents had issues to deal with in Texas, getting 
closer to grandparents, new job opportunities, a different scene. There 
were many reasons for leaving. But Kandi didn&#39;t really care about them. 
All she was aware of at the time was the fact that she would be 
separated from Janelle. And for all intensive purposes, Janelle was 
pretty bummed too. But that wasn&#39;t the only snag. Kandi knew that her 
moving to Texas would be a set-back, but she also knew that she wanted 
to maintain a long-distance relationship with Janelle. But the other 
girl wasn&#39;t up for it. She either wanted all of Kandi or none of her at 
all. Which didn&#39;t make sense to the redhead, but was logical in its own 
way. A long distance relationship wasn&#39;t an impossible feat, but it took 
tremendous commitment and trust on both sides for it to work. If Janelle 
wasn&#39;t prepared to undergo that, then there was no hope for them. 

And so they broke up.

In the six months between their break-up and now, Kandi and Janelle had 
stayed in touch with each other as friends. There would be times when 
Janelle would earn enough money from her part-time job to visit her in 
Victoria. The most recent case of that was at the birthday party of 
Summer Andrews; just a short few weeks ago. Janelle had flown out with 
all dedication in mind and met Kandi at Summer&#39;s party, which was where 
they exchanged one of their sexual &#39;goodbyes&#39; Kandi had enjoyed that 
night so very much. Mostly because she still cared for Janelle. But in 
truth, she got the feeling that Janelle was a little upset by having to 
say goodbye to Kandi once again. Which the redhead surmised as the 
reason for Janelle not calling her in the past three weeks. It made 
sense in its own way. But it didn&#39;t do Kandi any favours.

The young woman stared aimlessly at the phone. It still wasn&#39;t ringing. 
Was this Janelle&#39;s way of... dumping her? Of course, they weren&#39;t 
exactly a couple anymore, so that couldn&#39;t correctly be the case. But it 
was... complicated with the two of them. Kandi and Janelle weren&#39;t 
exactly lovers... but they weren&#39;t just friends either. In fact, even if 
Kandi did find someone else, she felt obliged not to do anything about 
it without Janelle&#39;s &#39;permission&#39;. It was her devotion that made the 
relationship between herself and Janelle so convoluted. Maybe this was 
Janelle&#39;s way of saying that she wanted out?

The moment she thought of that, Kandi pouted, her eyes narrowing. It 
made her angry. Very angry in fact. But from such a cute girl as 
herself, such anger could only look adorable. The redheaded teen 
uncurled her arms from her large panda bear, then slid off her bed and 
stomped out of her bedroom. Kandi ignored the sound of her mom cooking 
downstairs, the frying pan sizzling loudly from the kitchen, and just 
marched into the bathroom. She swung the door closed behind her, the 
vibration jittering the cosmetic appliances on the shelves. Her small 
feet then padded over the tiles of the bathroom and straight across to 
the shower compartment. Her hand reached in behind the plastic veil and 
grabbed the four-pronged tap, turning it. A warm jet of water gushed 
downwards from the valve and Kandi pulled her hand out from behind the 
shower curtain. Which was when she removed the only two pieces of 
clothing on her body. Her large Atlantic High sweatshirt came first. The 
girl crossed her arms over her chest, gripping its fabric, then pulled 
it off her body in one go The sweatshirt dropped to her ankles, while 
Kandi hooked her fingers into her white bunny panties and pulled &#39;um 
right off her thighs, legs and feet. Leaving her utterly naked. Kandi 
then stepped carefully into the shower compartment, pulling the curtain 
back then forward again. By now the water had warmed into a hot stream. 
And Kandi immersed herself in it. 

Hot water ran itself down the exquisite curves and bounces of the young 
woman&#39;s body. It was times like this when an external source would have 
understood just how beautiful she truly was. A vision of human 
perfection, you might say. 

Her full name was Katherine Monica Danders. 

But she was never very fond of the name &#39;Katherine&#39; or of the shorter 
version, &#39;Kathy&#39;. So her friends had nicknamed her &#39;Kandi&#39; for as long 
as she could remember. But no matter how anyone regarded her, they all 
knew one thing. She was absolutely gorgeous. 

Possessed of a pale milky skin tone, lusciously glossy strawberry blonde 
hair that trailed all the way down to the crests of her small and fully 
rounded ass, big and expressive baby blue eyes, a button nose and soft 
cheeks sprinkled with cute auburn freckles, a lithe and gentle figure, 
and a pert pair of moderately-sized breasts topped off with pink fleshed 
nipples. The kind of body that so many women would sell their souls to 
have, and yet Kandi was so very ignorant of her own beauty. In the 
humblest possible sense she loved herself. But as a person first. 
Perhaps that was why Janelle meant so much to her. The girl looked past 
Kandi&#39;s beauty and saw her for what she was. But now Janny was ignoring 
her. For whatever reason, the cheerleader was not calling her or 
answering her calls. And the more that Kandi thought about it, the more 
it... well, pissed her off.

Kandi&#39;s pretty little face contorted with anger again. &quot;...So you&#39;ve 
forgotten about me, Janny? Fine! If you&#39;re gonna forget about me then 
I&#39;m gonna forget about you!&quot;

While shower water continued to patter down from the valve, Kandi 
reached out a hand from the shower curtain and gripped one of the 
bottles of shampoo on the side shelf. Her fingers fumbled to grab the 
bottle, but she eventually snagged it, then dragged in with her. Kandi 
then squeezed a portion of the bottle onto her hands, still scoffing 
from the thought of Janelle abandoning her. Once she had gotten enough 
of it, she placed the bottle down on one of the shower compartment tiles 
and then ran the silky shampoo through her long tresses of red hair. In 
spite of everything she had to make herself look presentable. School 
started in just a few hours time And if Janelle could turn her back on 
Kandi, then Kandi would turn her back on her.

&quot;I wonder what Sarah&#39;s doing tonight?&quot;

**********

The Marson household, large as it was, could be a hectic place.

Never was that more obvious than today. Shannon Marson, teen popularity 
queen of the high school known as Atlantic High, had invited two of her 
friends around. Those two friends happened to be the closest members of 
her pack, Chloe James and Michelle Moore. They&#39;d come on Saturday night 
for what some people might have regarded as a &#39;sleepover&#39;. But in most 
cases it was just an opportunity for the three of them to drink, gossip, 
scarf pizza and gas on and on about who was rising and falling in the 
tricky thing that was teen high school hierarchy. 

While the three of them spent the weekend that way, a door down from 
Shannon&#39;s room was the bedroom of her headbanging, pot-smoking older 
sister, Terri Marson She was an isolated girl when she wasn&#39;t hanging 
with her friends at college, and so Chloe and Michelle hardly saw 
anything of her during their stay at Shannon&#39;s pad. The only thing that 
gave away Terri&#39;s presence from behind that door (with the mounted 
poster of a stop sign that said &#39;stay out!&#39;) was the sound of loud, 
wall-shaking nu-metal tracks banging out from the contours of her stereo 
system, and the faint waft of marijuana seeping out from the gaps of the 
door. Thankfully, Mr and Mrs. Marson were spending the week at a 
friend&#39;s house in El Paso, and they wouldn&#39;t becoming back until Friday. 

On this bright Monday morning, the same routine had overtaken the upper 
level of the house Shannon, Chloe and Michelle tried in vain to block 
out the sound of Terri&#39;s music and its profane, nihilistic lyrics while 
they did their thing. It was definitely a fruitless endeavour, as 
Shannon&#39;s teeth literally started grinding against each other in anger 
from the noise. The dirty blonde haired woman slapped her magazine down 
against her carpeted floor, pouting.

&quot;Dammit!&quot; Shannon whined, &quot;I&#39;m so sick of that girl! Plenty of people 
stay on campus when they want to, right? Why the hell couldn&#39;t she?!&quot;

Michelle, the youngest of the gathered, smiled softly from her seat on 
the floor, astride from her irate best friend. It was no secret that 
Shannon hated her older sister with a fiery passion, but Michelle wasn&#39;t 
the type to let people argue Especially not Shannon. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s not that 
loud, is it? Come on, Shannon, can&#39;t you just put up with it for now?&quot;

Shannon scoffed. &quot;Why the hell should I? Damn, I almost wish that mom 
and dad were back. I&#39;m gonna have to set her straight. Again.&quot;

Chloe, who was sitting on Shannon&#39;s bed and running a hair brush through 
her silky bangs, smiled at the two of them. &quot;Shannon, would you chill 
out a little? I like your sister. Sure, she&#39;s kinda odd, but it&#39;s just 
music, right?&quot;

&quot;Then you deal with it,&quot; Shannon muttered in defeat, &quot;I can&#39;t stand 
Terri.&quot;

And that was just the response that Chloe hoped Shannon would have. She 
had her own reasons for &#39;liking&#39; Terri, to no one&#39;s knowledge other than 
her own. Chloe swept the brush through her hair just once more, then 
dropped it to the bed, stepping off and slipping her feet into a pair of 
pink morning slippers she had brought with her. She walked out of the 
bedroom, the sound of the music in the background increasing from the 
opening of the door. Then she closed it behind her to spare Shannon the 
annoyance. Chloe strode down the long corridor past the guest rooms and 
over to Terri&#39;s door. 

The nubile teen giggled lightly with a knowing smile of intent, pressing 
her body against the banister. She then knocked on the door, as loudly 
as she could to be heard. Chloe heard the sound of movement shortly 
afterwards. The loudness of the music died down a little, and the sound 
of footsteps followed the action. As she drew near, Terri yelled, 
&quot;Shannon, can&#39;t you spend one goddamned day without bothering me? I&#39;m 
getting-&quot;

Once the door swung open and Terri looked out, she saw that the one 
waiting for her was not her younger sister, but rather Chloe, with a 
playful and seductive glint in her eye. The sound of music (though it 
had been turned down) increased once the door had been opened. And 
looking inside the room could show the faint clouds of distinct-smelling 
smoke from Terri&#39;s joint (or rather a culmination of them). Terri 
altered her tone of voice when she caught sight of Chloe. &quot;...It&#39;s you? 
Yeah... you&#39;re Sarah&#39;s sister, right? Sorry about that. Is there 
something you want?&quot;

Though she was surprised to see that Terri knew of her sister, Sarah, 
Chloe&#39;s cute smile widened. There was something she wanted. But for now, 
she&#39;d keep things just a little easy. 

Principally, Chloe James had a thing for &#39;bad girls&#39;. Though Terri 
Marson wasn&#39;t a perfect model of that. Sure, she was a chain smoker of 
pot, she listened the loudest possible punk/metal tracks she could find 
and she dressed in the most unfeminine clothes a Marson woman had ever 
seen (a favourite was the sheared denims and hooded sweatshirt). But 
Terri was surprisingly intelligent and rational. Although by 
personality, Terri wasn&#39;t all that bad of a person, it was her overall 
image that was a turn on for Chloe. A particular liking was of Terri&#39;s 
hair. It was short and black, but her bangs were almost as long as 
Chloe&#39;s. And more to the point, Terri had dyed her bangs pink, a la 
Agent M, which clashed vibrantly with the darkness of the rest of her 
hair. As hard as it was to believe, this little detail did a lot for 
Chloe. That &#39;neo-90&#39;s punk American teen&#39; look drove Miss James in just 
the right direction. Thus causing her little actions of flirtation. 
Chloe unconsciously crossed her legs, letting her one of her slippers 
dangle from her foot. One of her fingers absently curled a lock of her 
hair around it, while she herself was smiling.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Chloe said, &quot;I&#39;m one of Shannon&#39;s friends I&#39;m Chloe James? We met 
a little earlier?&quot;

Terri scratched the back of her head. &quot;We did? Sorry, I guess I forgot. 
So what do you need? Is it about the music? Did Shannon send you? Well 
you can tell that prissy little airhead where she can shove it.&quot;

Chloe winced. Terri and Shannon really couldn&#39;t stand each other. 
&quot;...Look, normally I wouldn&#39;t ask, but Shannon&#39;s a little peeved too. 
Could you cut me some slack this time around? As soon as we go you can 
turn it up as loud as you like.&quot;

&quot;...Eh, why not?&quot; Terri submitted, &quot;you seem nice enough But why in 
God&#39;s name do you hang out with my sister? She&#39;s such a...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s great when she&#39;s not angry,&quot; Chloe claimed, &quot;I mean she&#39;s not 
quite as pretty as me, but I like her a lot. But I like you, too.&quot;

Terri, unmindful to the true meaning of that, answered with, &quot;But you 
hardly know me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but that can change, right?&quot;

Chloe and Terri then began to converse. Flirtation mixing absently with 
obliviousness. While back in Shannon&#39;s room, the youngest Marson herself 
was happy that Chloe had somehow gotten Terri to turn down the music. It 
was still there, but not to such a degree as it was before, which was a 
bonus. With that, Shannon sighed and picked up her magazine again, 
flicking through the pages. 

&quot;Thank God for that,&quot; She mumbled, &quot;man, Terri&#39;s got no taste at all.&quot;

Michelle smiled bashfully. &quot;C&#39;mon. You know you care about her.&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding me? &#39;Shell, you know, you&#39;re far too nice about her. If 
you had a sister of your own that was even the slightest bit like Terri, 
you&#39;d understand where I&#39;m coming from. Yeah, you only-child families 
are so lucky.&quot;

The look on Michelle&#39;s face pretty much summed up the fact that she 
didn&#39;t see it that way. She would have loved to have had a sister, or 
even a brother; to look after or be looked after by. But Shannon only 
saw the problematic side to having siblings. It was one of those 
qualities that made Michelle wonder why she cared for Shannon in the way 
that she did. But it wasn&#39;t a detail so frank that she would ever stop 
caring for Shannon. Even now, Michelle looked on dreamily at the 
characteristically bitchy girl. Despite all her character flaws, Shannon 
was a Goddess to Michelle. When they had first become friends, Michelle 
just looked up to Shannon. She wore great clothes, she always had men 
eating out of her hand, she always got invited to parties, she was 
good-looking. That admiration continued for quite sometime. Until 
Michelle realized that her awe was becoming more of a lust. And that was 
so very apparent now. Just the thought of Shannon calming down made 
Michelle herself feel more at ease. And seeing Shannon in a happier mood 
better presented her hotness to the world. Michelle felt like she could 
spend hours just staring at Shannon.

But she obviously wouldn&#39;t get the chance.

The little ER-theme ringtone on Shannon&#39;s cell phone suddenly went off. 
Shannon heard this and reached for it on the bed, opening the flap and 
holding it by her ear. &quot;Hello? ...Ella? Well hey yourself. Where the 
heck are you? You said that you were coming over yesterday, right?&quot;

Michelle&#39;s smile suddenly fell whilst Shannon continued her 
conversation. One word had  been spoken in that little altercation that 
stuck in the girl&#39;s ears Ella. That Spanish girl who joined the 
cheerleading team a few months ago. And by far one of the most sought 
after girls in school, next to Shannon and Holly-Raine Johnson. In fact, 
when Michelle, Chloe and Shannon had gone to Summer&#39;s birthday party, 
the guys had shown more interest in Ella than anyone else. Victoria was 
a town very much set in its ways, and exotic women were a rarity. So 
when one reared her head, it was natural that people would be charmed. 
Shannon seemed to be one of those people. Sexual interest or not, it 
bothered Michelle that her best friend gave that much attention to Ella. 
And a brief hint of jealousy flickered through her eyes. Michelle didn&#39;t 
really think of it as a good thing.

But what exactly could she do about it?

**********

Sharon Daniels struggled to get her breathing back under control.

Her naked form lay out under the covers of her bed, prone, her breasts 
heaving, sweat clinging to her skin in tiny droplets. Her eyes were 
locked shut while her mouth was pulling a lusty smile, still reeling 
from what her lover had given her. That lover happened to be a certain 
girl named Holly-Raine Johnson. Arguably one of the finest, sexiest, 
more sexually active teen women in Victoria. She was also naked and 
rested below the covers. With a slow giggle, she dragged her head up 
from the gap between Sharon&#39;s thighs. Her cheeks, chin and lips were 
covered in the taller girl&#39;s slick discharge. Holly ran her tongue over 
her lips, lapping it up with appreciation; and then inched her way back 
up Sharon&#39;s torso, dropping little butterfly kisses up her naval, chest 
and neck. Holly&#39;s head of chestnut-brown hair popped up from the covers, 
grasping onto Sharon&#39;s serviced form tightly And the younger girl wound 
her arms around Sharon&#39;s neck, settling in an embrace, listening to the 
slowing pace of her breathing. Holly-Raine was very proud of her effect 
on women. But not more than she was for her power over Sharon 

Sharon herself sighed, eyes rolling, still running off the effects of 
her orgasm. When she found herself she managed to draw up her hand and 
run its fingers through Holly&#39;s chocolate brown hair. &quot;Man... the things 
you can do to me...&quot;

Holly smiled softly. Though she didn&#39;t often brag about it, she was no 
amateur when it came to the bedroom. &quot;Thanks. But try to keep it down, 
okay? Your mom and dad haven&#39;t gone to work yet, have they?&quot;

Sharon took the time to look around when Holly said that. Unlike most 
people, she had her bedroom in her attic. It had much larger space than 
one of the bedrooms below and was a lot cooler then the main house was 
in the summer heat. And best of all, it wasn&#39;t the kind of place that 
her parents got into easily. So she could be up here with Holly, 
screwing each other all night; and none would be the wiser. As long as 
they kept the noise down.

&quot;Nah,&quot; Sharon replied, &quot;but they&#39;ll be gone soon.&quot;

&quot;I suppose it doesn&#39;t make much difference,&quot; Holly said, &quot;school starts 
soon. We&#39;ll have to get out of bed some time.&quot;

Sharon smirked, wrapping Holly up around the waist. &quot;Do we? Man, I feel 
like just staying here for the day. Just me and you, no one else. How 
about it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to, but we can&#39;t...&quot; Holly said regrettably, &quot;I have that 
English report to hand in to Miss Blake today, remember? I&#39;ve been 
trying to stall her for weeks, but if I don&#39;t give it to her today, I&#39;m 
screwed. I&#39;d ask Summer or Jenny to do it for me, but...&quot;

&quot;But what?&quot;

&quot;Jenny&#39;s pretty occupied with her boyfriend right now. You&#39;ve met him, 
right? That football player from Saffron-Jameson High? Nathan, I think 
his name is. Those two are all over each other. And Summer? Well she&#39;s 
been in a bad mood for half a month now. I keep asking her what the 
problem is but she won&#39;t talk to me about it.&quot;

Sharon had a sneaking suspicion about it. But it wasn&#39;t necessarily the 
correct one. &quot;Look, Holly, I think Summer knows about us.&quot;

&quot;Huh? She does? Did you tell her?&quot;

&quot;Of course I didn&#39;t. I think she just guessed it. &#39;Member the first 
night we slept together? The day after... Summer was saying some weird 
stuff I think she&#39;s worried about you.&quot;

Holly-Raine blinked in confusion. &quot;But why couldn&#39;t she tell me that? I 
don&#39;t mind if she&#39;s worried about me. We&#39;re best friends.&quot;

The girl from Sacramento shrugged. &quot;Beats me. Ask her yourself when you 
get the chance. I don&#39;t see how it&#39;s any of her business, anyway. We&#39;ll 
do what we wanna do, right?&quot;

&quot;But Sharon, it *is* her business. Like I said, she&#39;s my best friend. We 
look out for each other when we have to. When she was dating that waste 
of space, Jackson, I kept nagging at her to dump the guy. And sure 
enough she did. That&#39;s just how it is between us.&quot;

&quot;Is that you&#39;re way of calling me a waste of space?&quot; Sharon suggested 
with a smirk. 

Holly leaned upwards, shaking her head. &quot;I didn&#39;t mean it like that!&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. I&#39;m just kidding around. Look, don&#39;t worry about it. 
Just talk to Summer and tell her that everything&#39;s good between us Maybe 
that&#39;ll stop her from worrying so much about you. And when that&#39;s 
settled, you and I can kick back and relax.&quot;

Another lusty grin came to Holly&#39;s face, still sticky with Sharon&#39;s gush 
of vaginal fluids. The green-eyed teen leaned downwards and kissed her 
girlfriend generously. Sharon moaned at the thrill of tasting her cum on 
Holly&#39;s lips, and so the two lay together, frenching like there was no 
tomorrow. The sounds of smacking lips and light moans started to fill 
Sharon&#39;s attic once again Sharon and Holly-Raine had been inseparable 
since they first got together, and there were no signs of that to be 
ending. 

...At least not now.

**********

Sarah James waited silently by the sidewalk for her friend. It was a 
nice day out. The summer sun was shining, there was a nice cool breeze, 
and it was as quiet as it would ever be. Atlantic High was just a short 
distance away, about ten minutes from where Sarah was right now. But she 
couldn&#39;t leave just yet. She was waiting for Kandi to make her 
appearance (at some point). The young woman sighed and tugged on a curl 
of her platinum hair, whilst smoothing out her skirt with the other 
hand. Sarah was the kind of girl that didn&#39;t like to wait, but was often 
forced to do so. But she was used to it by now. Her friend Kandi was the 
kind of girl that often came late. This was just one occasion in a 
string of others, realistically speaking. 

However, Kandi was never so late that Sarah had to think about leaving 
without her. She waited outside by the old gymnasium for her every 
morning, and like usual, Kandi arrived just five or so minutes late. 
Sarah&#39;s smile brightened when saw her friend strolling down the street 
in a pair of jeans shorts and a small white top, which had a heart 
printed on it, stating the phrase &#39;bad girl&#39;. In her arms was a little 
school folder, containing her homework and a few notes she had made 
while studying for a pop quiz in Physics. Kandi strode up to the blonde 
with a forced smile on her face. At first Sarah was pleased to see Kandi 
But then she noted that something was wrong with her.

&quot;Kandi?&quot; Sarah said carefully, &quot;is something wrong?&quot;

The strawberry-blonde haired girl blinked. Sarah could see right through 
her. They had been friends for a good five months now, and Sarah could 
de-fragment her expressions and moods effortlessly. Perhaps more so than 
even Janelle could. And Sarah was the only one of her new friends who 
actually knew about Janelle and her sexuality. &quot;...It&#39;s Janny, Sarah...&quot;

&quot;Still hasn&#39;t called you, huh?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so totally wrong!&quot; Kandi yelled, brandishing her inexplicable 
Valley accent/dialect, &quot;I thought things were going alright between us I 
mean, at Summer&#39;s party, she and I, well, y&#39;know, we &#39;borrowed&#39; one of 
Summer&#39;s rooms and...&quot;

Sarah sighed, blushing in embarrassment. &quot;I get the picture...&quot;

&quot;Well after that, everything was fine. We got dressed, enjoyed the 
party, then when she had to go, I saw her off in a cab. I thought she&#39;d, 
y&#39;know, call me to tell me that she had gotten home okay after the 
flight. So when Janny didn&#39;t call me, I called her. Her mom picked up 
the phone and said that she had gotten home, but that she was out at the 
time. And like, that same thing happened again and again. I left so many 
messages on her phone it&#39;s crazy! I know she&#39;s avoiding me. I can&#39;t 
stand it. I can&#39;t stand the thought that... y&#39;know, she doesn&#39;t wanna be 
with me anymore.&quot;

Though she tried her hardest to be angry (and anger was not an emotion 
that came to Kandi with any form of ease) it was obvious that Kandi was 
more hurt by this than anything else. It was her relationship with 
Janelle that occupied most of her time and thoughts So much so that it 
would have been hard to believe that Janelle lived in an entirely 
separate state.

&quot;I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;m following you, Kandi,&quot; Sarah admitted, &quot;aren&#39;t 
you and she just friends? I mean I know you still sleep with her from 
time to time, but... if you think of each other as friends at the 
most... doesn&#39;t that give her the right to move on?&quot;

Kandi looked upward, into the skies. &quot;I&#39;m not asking her to marry me or 
anything. I&#39;d just be nice for her to talk to me? I mean is that like, 
so unreasonable? I just can&#39;t stand the idea that she&#39;s, y&#39;know, forcing 
me out. Besides, she was the one who wanted to break up, not me I wanted 
keep in touch with her. I bet she&#39;s avoiding me out of guilt I bet she 
hooked up with someone else. I don&#39;t think she loves me anymore&quot;

Now it was overtly obvious that Kandi really was upset. Sarah pulled a 
smile and roped one of her arms around the redhead&#39;s shoulder, then 
started walking her forwards. If they stayed here any longer then they 
really would be late. Whilst walking, Sarah spoke up once again, 
stating,

&quot;Look, sweetie. If Janelle&#39;s not interested in you anymore then it&#39;s her 
loss. That&#39;s what I think. You&#39;re great, you know? You could have 
anybody you want. I know it might not mean much coming from me or 
anybody else, but, I wouldn&#39;t get upset about it.&quot;

A few seconds later, Kandi pulled a smile. A real one. &quot;...You always 
know what to say to me, Sarah. And here I am, totally talking about 
myself when I haven&#39;t even asked how you are. So what&#39;s going on with 
you?&quot;

&quot;Ah, not much,&quot; Sarah confessed, shrugging, &quot;did a little studying 
Saturday. Cassie and I went up to that poetry fair I told you about the 
day before You should have come.&quot;

&quot;Poetry fair?&quot; Kandi replied sceptically. 

&quot;It&#39;s not as boring as it sounds. But I know you don&#39;t like that sort of 
thing. Of course Cassie is ten times the writer that I am. Her poems won 
all the competitions that she put them in. But she wouldn&#39;t have entered 
them if not for her girlfriend.&quot;

Kandi didn&#39;t know Cassie all that well, it was only through her 
friendship with Sarah and Sarah&#39;s friendship with Cassie that the two 
were even aware of each other. &quot;Cassie has a girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t know? Well, I suppose you and she aren&#39;t that close It&#39;s 
that Alyshia girl. Cassie didn&#39;t tell me about it until yesterday, but, 
I can understand why. Not everyone&#39;s as up front as you are, Kandi.&quot;

&quot;Well I don&#39;t know about that, Sarah,&quot; To be honest, Kandi wasn&#39;t 
extremely explicit in detail and pride for her liking of girls. Though 
she was open with it to Sarah, their friendship made her an exception. 
The freckled wonder was never vocal about it to anyone else. In fact the 
only one who even partially seemed to suspect Kandi&#39;s attraction to 
other women was Holly-Raine Johnson, who was, in Kandi&#39;s rather humble 
opinion, the only girl in Atlantic High who she found to be as 
attractive as Janelle, &quot;...Look, I&#39;m feeling kinda bummed right now. You 
wanna do something later? You wanna hit the mall after-school?&quot;

Sarah smiled. &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;

**********

Monica Shane had hidden passions.

You didn&#39;t tend to expect it from substitute teachers. Growing up in 
Victoria, TX; few people made a point of taking any great notice of 
substitutes to really notice. In that background, the idea was that you 
didn&#39;t think too much about &#39;um. You screwed around in class, free from 
the normal restraints of your old, permanent teacher (who happened to be 
absent) and when they were gone the next day, it was like... having a 
&#39;day off&#39;. It wasn&#39;t the same with &#39;Miss Shane&#39;. Because she was a 
substitute teacher for a gym class; but not on a one-day basis. Monica 
was lumbered (or blessed) with the duty of teaching that particular gym 
class for the next two months.  

The class&#39; original teacher, Coach Jeffers, was off on Pregnancy Leave 
(and that in itself was shocking to more than a few people; after all, 
no one expected such a stereotypically butch looking woman like that to 
fall pregnant in her forties) and wouldn&#39;t be able to teach for quite a 
while. Thus Monica was fulfilling those duties for the time being. She 
had no problems with it. And when Monica moved here from San Antonio, it 
was bluntly apparent that she needed the money. With bills, rent, 
personal expenses and the payments of her car, it wasn&#39;t like she could 
be faulted with this. Of course, when Monica learned what particular 
class she would be teaching, her outlook changed from jaded to eager. 
She had the duty of overseeing Swimming Lessons. It was an optional 
lesson for the teenage beauties at Atlantic High, that much was sure, 
but those who chose it really wanted to be here. And they weren&#39;t they 
only ones.

Hence the earlier reference to Monica&#39;s &#39;hidden passions&#39;.

She was a substitute teacher in her late twenties, unlucky in love and 
cursed with a desire for the unappreciated and under-respected art of 
teaching. But the other thing she happened to have an abundance of was 
an attraction to the young women currently on display before her. A 
secret Monica kept even from her controlling ex-girlfriend, Samantha 
Byers (A/N see Misadventures of Holly-Raine, chapter four/five). One 
thing Atlantic High had going for it in every possible aspect, was its 
students There was no better display of that than here. 

Monica sat on a small indoor deck chair on the west side of Atlantic 
High&#39;s indoor swimming pool. That pool was at a length of about 55x12 
metres, and the whole hall boasted a faint aroma of chlorine and 
half-naked flesh. At the south end of the pool was Monica&#39;s class, a 
group of around twenty teen-women. All of them adorned in a multiplicity 
of swimsuits. Some colourful, some bland; some one-piece while others 
were two-piece (three guesses as to which was Monica&#39;s preference in 
that respect). Though the substitute&#39;s mind should have been on the 
education of her students rather than their bodily assets, a good 73% of 
Monica&#39;s mind was transfixed with sight of her &#39;girls&#39; all dressed this 
way. The other 27% managed to keep itself under control, for what it was 
worth. 

The class had just gotten dressed in their swimsuits and yet Monica 
could already feel the damp patch of her undies spreading in wideness. 
But she had a class to teach before she dwelled on... that. 

Monica quickly stood up from her deckchair and placed the whistle 
dangling from her neck to her lips. She blew into it, grabbing the 
attention of her students, then pushed the whistle from her mouth via 
her tongue. &quot;Okay, girls! We&#39;ll have a few warm-ups before we get into 
anything too detailed, alright? Split into pairs of two and take a 
plunge. Once you get to the other end, walk back around and line up 
again. We&#39;ll quit when I say when, okay? Go for it.&quot;

Her pupils did exactly as they were asked (although slowly due to all 
the whispers and girl talk) and got into pairs of two. The first pair 
lined up at the edge of the pool and then dove into the bluish mass of 
chlorine-addled liquid, just as Monica took her seat again. The two swam 
to outdo each other, kicking their lovely long legs behind them while 
the water around their bodies was swashed. Monica looked from those two 
to the next pair that was lining up by the edge of the pool. It was 
Sarah James and her good friend, that Dakotan girl by the nickname of 
Kandi. The moment Monica saw her, the teacher&#39;s cheeks flushed. Almost 
in a schoolgirl manner Though her attraction to young women was a 
predominantly universal thing, it was really Kandi who caught Monica&#39;s 
greatest attention. And that wasn&#39;t all that surprising. Out of all the 
girls whom Monica had had the pleasure to meet since coming to Atlantic 
High, the one who stuck out the most was probably Kandi. 

She was just so adorable. 

With those gorgeous baby blue eyes, those faint snowflake-like freckles 
and those firm yet well-rounded breasts, Kandi was almost bewitching. 
But the fact that Monica loved most about her was the hair. Those long 
tresses of strawberry blonde inched all the way down to the lowest part 
of her shoulder blades. Beauty was always in/rated by the eye of the 
beholder; but no one could argue with how sexy Kandi was. No one, 
especially not Monica, could really mistake that. Consequently, Kandi 
was definitely Monica&#39;s... &#39;favourite&#39;. And the teacher could have died, 
just right there and then, when she saw Kandi&#39;s breasts jiggle slightly 
as she and Sarah dove into the water. Though Kandi didn&#39;t really have a 
very happy expression on her face today (which was odd, &#39;cause Kandi was 
such a cheerful girl) it did nothing to deride her beauty. Or the 
attraction that Monica was feeling. But there was nothing that Monica 
could do to... &#39;ease&#39; the tension. At least not here. So she was forced 
to endure the glorious sight of Kandi as she swam in competition with 
Sarah, moving in swift but slightly uncoordinated strokes.

And Monica spent the next hour doing the same thing. Overseeing the 
young ones, giving them instructions on exercises and helping them 
polish their technique, until the bell rang. Gym was the last lesson of 
the day, as usual Atlantic High students broke up early on Mondays. But 
it couldn&#39;t come a minute sooner for the teacher The second that the 
girls rose up from the pool to either get changed into their normal 
clothes or take showers, Monica climbed up from her deckchair and 
marched down the edge of the pool, overstepping the small, watery 
footprints of her students, and out into the surrounding corridor of the 
swimming pool hall. She then strode into a separate room, one which 
happened to be the office (if a gym teacher needed such a thing) of 
Coach Jeffers. Once she entered, Monica locked the door behind her and 
gasped for breath, pressing her hand into her chest. Though she loved 
seeing her students that way, controlling herself around Kandi was a 
different story altogether Half the time Monica couldn&#39;t stop staring at 
her. And the other half, it was all Monica could do not to grab Kandi 
and drag her through the greatest bout of sexual pleasure she was ever 
likely to receive. 

That thought in itself drove the teacher wild. 

And with that, she couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Monica jogged over to the 
far window and shut the blinds. Then she sat down on the chair of the 
desk just a short ways ahead of it. Once she was settled, Monica leaned 
back and closed her eyes. With one hand she pulled back a strand of her 
shoulder-length black hair and with the other she undid the button of 
her baggy beige shorts. Considering the lingering warmth of the outside, 
this wasn&#39;t a bad choice of dress, but shorts that thin couldn&#39;t really 
conceal premature discharge for very long. So illustrated when Monica 
slipped her fingers under the elastic band of her lower garment. Those 
fingers curved in around the slick and terribly moist vulva. Monica bit 
her lower lip to keep herself from making any noise, just light moans, 
as she slowly rubbed the length of her middle finger between the slight 
indentation of her labia. The wetness was instantly prevalent, allowing 
Monica&#39;s middle finger to glide effortlessly back and forth in 
systematic rhythm. With her left hand trapped in her shorts, her right 
hand shoved its way up her overalls. She latched onto her left breast, 
and quickly plucked at her rock-hard nipple, adequately rolling the 
sensitive flesh between her fingertips. With one hand massaging her 
dampened snatch and the other teasing and massaging her breast, of 
course Monica couldn&#39;t sustain her silence. Her mouth opened and she 
released a hoarse cry; trapped within the luckily soundproof office 
room. But Monica&#39;s mind was conceiving a far different scenario within 
itself. While the substitute&#39;s breathless cries rallied to the tempo of 
her self-inflicted ministrations, her brain was imagining something 
else. 

In her mind, Monica stood beside her desk rather than on its chair. In 
her mind she could see herself dressed in a provocatively-cut business 
suit, in a slightly better decorated office. Then suddenly Monica could 
picture the office door swing open. Kandi stood thereafter. Still 
dressed in her tight and innocently revealing swimsuit Kandi and Monica 
locked eyes and stared into each other, mirroring the other&#39;s lust and 
passions in a way that only they could express. Kandi slowly began the 
walk up to Monica and the desk. The closer she got, the more apparent 
her own desire became. Monica stood dazzled by the sight of Kandi&#39;s 
erect pink nipples straining under the confides of her swimsuit. The two 
came face to face Kandi looked up at Monica with wide eyes of wonder, 
lust, curiosity and an ever so slight flicker of anxiousness. While the 
taller woman gazed down at Kandi with eyes possessing nothing more than 
carnivorous, wanton, sexual greed. Monica&#39;s lips lunged down on those of 
Kandi. The younger woman released a tiny gasp of surprise; one that 
melted away into a sigh. The two moaned into each other&#39;s mouths with 
their first kiss. Monica tilted her head to one side and delved herself 
into the dull sweetness  of Kandi&#39;s pink lips. Her stronger arms reached 
around the redhead&#39;s nubile young body, dragging her in closer with a 
firm yet soft embrace. Her tongue soon prised its way between Kandi&#39;s 
lips, opening their kiss fully. Kandi herself grasped onto Monica&#39;s 
cheeks and flicked her tongue around and about that of Monica. The two 
probed against each other, exchanging and heightening their individual 
desires. During the kiss, Monica&#39;s thigh and knee ran between the gap of 
Kandi&#39;s legs. There was a reaction when the strawberry-blonde felt 
Monica&#39;s thigh press possessively against the thin fabric that bound her 
honey pot from view. Her gasps of pleasure coalesced with Monica&#39;s moans 
of appreciation. And suddenly their kiss became more desperate. 

The two clung to each other even tighter and increased the intensity of 
their lip lock. With Monica&#39;s tongue buried down the girl&#39;s throat,  
they quickly ambled themselves into position with the desk. The teacher 
freed up one hand and swiped the desk clean of everything, knocking off 
the papers, forms, pens, pencil jar and water glass, so that it all came 
crashing down to the ground. Kandi held on tight as she felt herself 
being lowered onto the desk by her back. And before she knew it, Monica 
was on top of her, straddling her by the hips. The older woman broke 
their kiss seconds afterwards. Kandi gasped for breath upon that 
release. Her chest heaved up and down, her rigid nipples still poking 
hard into the upper half of her swimsuit. And while the freckled girl 
caught her breath, Monica left nothing to the imagination of her 
fantasies (even though this itself was a fantasy). The dark-haired one 
dragged her tongue over Kandi&#39;s cheeks and jaw. Her lips swiftly started 
dropping butterfly kisses over Kandi&#39;s face and then lower down to her 
neck, ravishing her youthful, milky, and inexplicably under-tanned skin. 
In addition Monica&#39;s hands  grasped and clawed at Kandi&#39;s body without 
any misgivings of possession. Her hands stroked up and down the girl&#39;s 
sides, the curves of her thighs, then finally, the breasts. Monica tore 
off the &#39;bra&#39; portion of Kandi&#39;s swimwear. And then her lips lunged for 
that left mound. 

Kandi cried out, muttering &#39;Monica&#39; when the older woman began a 
domineering suckle of her newly revealed nipple. Monica moaned from 
nothing more than that satiation of her own lust when her lips curled 
around that stiff nub. Her tongue flicked at it. Her teeth gnawed at it 
(albeit softly). Kandi&#39;s mouth was wide open but her eyes were firmly 
shut. She was in heaven. She felt it all the more so when Monica&#39;s other 
hand reached up and enfolded her right breast Monica&#39;s touch was so firm 
and yet so gentle. The manipulation of Kandi&#39;s tits was handled so well. 
Not too much force and not too little, either The tingling Kandi got 
from feeling this educated woman of the world&#39;s tongue around her nipple 
was indescribable. And yet it would only better. By time that Monica 
pulled her mouth from Kandi&#39;s small right breast, the aureole was 
drenched in saliva. 

The teacher then quickly slid down Kandi&#39;s body, dropping gentle and 
momentary kisses over her flat stomach, descending towards the hips. 
Which the redhead knew was significant in action. She leaned her head up 
to observe what Monica was about to do. The teacher simply lowered 
herself along the desk so that her lips were hovering mere centimetres 
from Kandi&#39;s larger set of lips. There was a brief moment of silence. 
One that was blocked out by a scream that rent a sigh; as Monica pulled 
apart the girl&#39;s labia and pressed her tongue against the opening to 
Kandi&#39;s vagina. The younger woman dropped her head back to the surface 
of the desk and yelped girlish cries of ecstasy. With her masses of hair 
splayed out all around her head like a halo, Kandi whimpered and sighed 
aggressively, helplessly mumbling &#39;oh God... oh God...&#39; to herself. The 
powerful feeling of Monica&#39;s tongue running up and down her vaginal 
opening simply overwhelmed her. Kandi&#39;s little toes curled into her feet 
and her long legs wrapped themselves around the upper section of 
Monica&#39;s torso The Dakotan teen then ran her fingers into Monica&#39;s dark 
tresses and held on for dear life to the sensation. Monica, with her 
face buried deep into Kandi&#39;s purposely hairless crotch and her nose 
filled to overflowing with the scent of arousal; could have been on no 
higher cloud. This was what she wanted above all else. To hear Kandi 
gasping with pleasure. To be able to smell and taste the girl&#39;s 
bitter-tangy/sweet-sour arousal. To see her writhing and coursing in 
bliss. It was all Monica ever wanted. Kandi then bit her lip when she 
felt something build. Like something was gonna burst or be &#39;let loose&#39;. 
And so it happened. Kandi attempted in vain to keep her herself in 
control when the-wave-that-was-orgasm overtook her. Monica didn&#39;t relent 
from her kissing and licking of Kandi&#39;s opening. So she tasted the 
results of her work first hand. Kandi&#39;s cum spurted forwards from the 
cleft of her fleshy cunt, splattering over the lips and chin of Monica. 
The older woman pulled back a little when it ended, only to dab her 
tongue over her lips and sample Kandi&#39;s zesty flavour once again.

Kandi, stunned, tingling and breathless by the tide of her orgasm, 
slowly opened her eyes and adjusted them to the first thing she saw. The 
ceiling. Then she looked downwards She could see her small but rounded 
breasts heaving up and down, Monica&#39;s saliva trickling down from her 
left nipple along the curve of the mound. Finally Kandi&#39;s eyes settled 
on Monica&#39;s face, smeared by her own vaginal juices.

&quot;...Miss Shane... Monica...&quot; Kandi corrected herself, &quot;I love you so 
much...&quot;

When a knock came at the door in the real world, Monica&#39;s fantasy ended. 
Her head jerked up with a start. Then she remembered the actual 
situation. One of her hands was buried in her panties and the other was 
trapped around her breast. With an awkward and extremely embarrassed 
look on her face, Monica called out to the person on the other side of 
the door. 

&quot;Uh... w-what is it...?&quot;

&quot;Are you okay in there?&quot; Judging by the voice it was Summer Andrews, 
&quot;You rushed in so fast you didn&#39;t get the chance to tell us to clean 
up.&quot;

&quot;...Um... sorry, Summer. I&#39;m fine. Go get changed, alright? I have a few 
things to sort out in here first.&quot; Summer replied with a brief &#39;okay&#39; 
and left. Monica sighed afterwards. Summer didn&#39;t hear anything 
(thankfully). She&#39;d have to be more careful about this kind of thing in 
the future. Of course... with girls like Kandi Danders running around...

...life for a substitute teacher could be surprisingly difficult.

Chris Angel says,

* Whoo! The first chapter of the Misadventures of Kandi. I hope you 
enjoyed it. I decided to back off from the Debbie/Linda thing from now 
on, since their relationship problems were more or less resolved in 
MoHR, but I wouldn&#39;t mind devoting a chapter to them if there is a 
request for it at some point. 

* If you read chapter five of the Misadventures of Holly-Raine then you 
might notice that Kandi&#39;s personality has changed a bit. I decided to 
make her a little more assertive when I realized that she bore too many 
similarities with Anna. I hope that wasn&#39;t too much of a 180 for anyone. 

* If you have any comments be sure to get in touch with me. I love 
hearing from the people who enjoy my stories. And I&#39;m still taking 
requests now, but Sharon and Sarah are off limits. I have specific plans 
for &#39;um. Anyone else is good ^_^ 

* Thanks to &#39;Chase&#39; for his Monica request. I don&#39;t usually do 
relationships between teachers and students but I have to say that I 
loved your idea.
