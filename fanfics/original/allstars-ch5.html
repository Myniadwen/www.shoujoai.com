6:55 am

            For sixteen years now, the wail of sirens bleeding through 
the thin walls of a ramshackle apartment in the darker corners of the 
nation&#39;s capital have served as her alarm clock, waking her well before 
any shaft of light could penetrate through her window.  There is no such 
thing as a good siren--ambulances carry the wounded, fire trucks go to 
put out blazes, squad cars fight crime--but she has grown accustomed to 
them; they&#39;re as much a part of her life as the house itself, and its 
only other resident:  her father, who is her inspiration, even in this 
pit.  It&#39;s one of the worst places for a person to live, especially if 
they are a young lady, and she has been forced to evolve and adapt 
because of this harsh environment.  But behind that tomboy surface was a 
gentle heart, and a flicker of hope that broke through just like the 
first rays of the sun brought morning to her noisy world.  This was most 
evident in a needlepoint stitch her mother gave her about nine years 
ago, just after the divorce.  It had guided her through some hard times, 
and it would still be there for her today.  It read:

&quot;The mind is its own place, and in itself

Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.&quot;

            &quot;Just another day,&quot; she yawned, rising slowly.

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Just Another Day&quot;

            &quot;I tell ya what, Bracton, I sure am glad we took the &#39;late&#39; 
shift!&quot;

            Arthur Warren stretched his limbs as far as they could go, 
yawning and groaning as he basked in the warm air of early August.  It 
was the afternoon of the second day of try-outs and the end of the men&#39;s 
shift, and so far, they had been fairly prosperous.  Seven guys had made 
the cut on the first day; four more were added earlier, although the 
coach was considering reducing their number.  He wanted to put his men 
through a series of tests to find out which of them were most apt to 
represent the fledgling team.  Mr. Warren was not so concerned about 
that; he was just happy to sit back, relax, and wait for Leena to 
relieve him.  As he leaned back, admiring the sky&#39;s golden-blue warmth, 
he saw the beautiful blonde and her young companion approaching, a bag 
of towels, fresh water bottles, and a clipboard in tow.

            &quot;Say, look who&#39;s here!  Afternoon, ladies!&quot;  Warren climbed 
out of his chair, yawning and stretching again, and smiled lazily.  &quot;I 
tell ya, this is the sweetest job I&#39;ve ever had.  Maybe I should go 
thank ol&#39; Rosewood for twisting my arm.  How&#39;d it go yesterday?&quot;

            &quot;As fair as we expected it to,&quot; Leena answered, grimly 
optimistic.  &quot;Out of about ten or so applicants, we managed to put six 
on our list, but half of them are beginners.  They do have potential, 
but it&#39;ll be like turning coal into diamonds.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, I see.  Well, knowing your track record, I&#39;m sure you 
could whip them into shape.  Stanton did win those championships.  So 
are there any areas you&#39;re lacking in?&quot;

            &quot;What we really need is a balanced offensive player.&quot;  Leena 
showed Arthur her clipboard, pointing to different names.  &quot;These notes 
were written on the sly, but I think you&#39;ll understand the gist.  
Nazario here is amazing, but she&#39;s like a sword that&#39;s been sharpened 
too much.  I&#39;ve been thinking about making Khovansky here the team 
captain, but she holds back far too much, and she&#39;s vulnerable under 
pressure.  Velur is one of the best I&#39;ve seen, but she&#39;s like a balloon 
with too much air.  We must find at least one more strong player to 
balance all this out.  It&#39;s too bad most of the girls from Stanton have 
moved away and gone on to other things--I really could&#39;ve used the Fox 
sisters, or Miss Walker.&quot;

            &quot;So you need a solid player with a level head and just the 
right amount of aggression, huh?&quot;  Warren pursed his lips, humming, and 
raised his eyebrow as he thought of something.  &quot;I might just be able to 
help you out there, Leena.  Yo, Bracton!  You can go on without 
me--this&#39;ll take awhile!&quot;

            &quot;All right.  Men, that was fine work you showed today.  I&#39;d 
advise you to keep it up if you want to stay on the team!&quot;  The coach 
and the new recruits left the field, and so Arthur got the privacy he 
wanted.

            &quot;As I was saying,&quot; he resumed, &quot;this might be a long shot, 
but if it works out, you may have just the gal you need.&quot;

            &quot;Oh?  Do you know of someone?&quot;

            &quot;Uh...sort of,&quot; he grinned, rubbing his chin sheepishly.  
&quot;Ya see, once the last semester ended, I took Tia and the kids to 
Philadelphia and Washington, DC for our summer vacation.  They&#39;ve never 
been, so as a history buff, I was itching to show them the sights.  
Anyway, while we were wandering around the parks in DC, we saw this 
soccer game going on.  This is where things got interesting.  I didn&#39;t 
really think much of it until I saw this one woman come onto the field.  
The players called her their &#39;secret weapon&#39;, and I gotta tell you, 
Leena, that was no exaggeration.  She blew through the other team like 
they were kindergarteners--and these were guys in their prime!  This 
girl turned the tide of the game and didn&#39;t even seem to break a sweat.  
Of course, I might be exaggerating things a little, but I haven&#39;t been 
that impressed since I went mano-a-mano with the Sultan of Sw--uh, I 
mean, since I heard Tia sing at the opera.&quot;

            &quot;Just what are you saying, Arthur?&quot; Leena wondered.  He 
smiled craftily, a sure sign of trouble.

            &quot;I&#39;m saying...why not let me run off and see if I can find 
her?  DC&#39;s not that far away, and it&#39;s not like I have any real 
responsibilities here.  Bracton&#39;s got all the guys he needs.  Hell, he&#39;s 
even got the luxury of getting rid of a few!  Tia won&#39;t mind, and 
Rosewood will encourage it!  &#39;It&#39;ll keep you out of trouble,&#39; she&#39;d say 
with that wily smile of hers.&quot;

            &quot;But what are the odds that you&#39;d actually find this woman 
again?  Do you know her name, or where she lives?  Do you even know 
where that park is?&quot;

            &quot;Look,&quot; he answered smoothly, &quot;don&#39;t sweat the details, 
okay?  I&#39;m pretty good at finding people.  If you&#39;re still feeling 
uncertain about it, why not let some of the players accompany me?  Who 
knows, they might help me close the sale.&quot;  Now it was Leena&#39;s turn to 
think.  It didn&#39;t seem like a bad proposal, but would anybody be willing 
to go along with him?  She was certain most of the women would like to 
start practicing, or at least get to know their teammates.  Who would 
even volunteer for such a thing...

            &quot;Coach?  Are we going to start this thing or not?&quot;  A voice 
barked at her from behind, pulling her thoughts away.  Nobody from the 
team should&#39;ve been there, so who...

            &quot;Now Fausta, really!  What gives you the right to say that, 
especially since we shouldn&#39;t even be here?  Oh, Coach Leena, I am sorry 
for the intrusion!  We were just getting ready to go about our 
business!&quot;  Elisa Berkeley was glaring at Fausta Nazario, but they 
weren&#39;t the only ones on the field:  Felicity Velur was there as well, 
performing warm-up exercises by herself.  Leena stared at Fausta, 
wondering why the hotheaded young woman was there, right when the next 
batch of applicants were coming in.

            &quot;Excuse me, ladies, but can I help you?&quot;

            &quot;Oh no, Coach, we really have no business here,&quot; Elisa 
blurted.  Fausta preempted her and spoke up loudly, puffing her chest 
out defiantly.

            &quot;We&#39;re here to practice, of course.  This is the nearest 
soccer field I know of.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, don&#39;t listen to her, she came to...ugh, how 
absurd...she came to examine the ladies you were going to recruit.&quot;

            &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with seeing who your future teammates 
are,&quot; Fausta argued coolly.  &quot;It&#39;s all for reference, Leena.  I just 
want to see what I have to work with.&quot;

            &quot;You mean who you have to work with,&quot; she replied sternly.  
Leena suddenly grinned and turned to face Arthur Warren.  &quot;You know, I 
think I have just the volunteers you need.&quot;

And so...

            &quot;Just sit back and enjoy the ride, ladies!&quot; Warren exclaimed 
proudly.  &quot;Before ya know it, we&#39;ll be in the nation&#39;s capital, 
recruiting another fine young player.  You go ahead and chatter to your 
heart&#39;s content.  I&#39;ve got a girl around your age; I&#39;m used to it!&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ll pass,&quot; Fausta sighed.

            &quot;No thanks,&quot; Felicity mumbled.  She couldn&#39;t understand why 
she had been asked to go.  Her intentions had been pure, and she hadn&#39;t 
been doing anything wrong.  She was obviously practicing for the coming 
season, and wanted to squeeze as much time as she could into her day, 
before school started.  Did Leena really think she was Fausta&#39;s 
accomplice, or was there another reason she was here in this car?  
Perhaps it didn&#39;t really matter:  she was literally going along for the 
ride now, and unless she jumped out--ooh, bad idea with the way this 
lunatic was driving!--she was in it for the long haul.  At least 
Washington, DC wasn&#39;t far away, and Fausta wasn&#39;t nearly as pesky as 
Nadia.

            But Nadia&#39;s not that annoying.  I really like her.  I just 
can&#39;t pursue that.

            &quot;Sheesh,&quot; Warren groaned, &quot;quiet as a tomb!  And here I 
thought you women would be talking up a storm.&quot;

            &quot;We don&#39;t really know each other very well, Mr. Warren,&quot; 
Fausta replied.

            &quot;So what better time than right now!?&quot;  The two teammates 
looked at each other, one an Italian who dominated her game, and the 
other an American who was pushed to perfection:  perfect ingredients for 
a storm.  Arthur was lucky they chose to hold their tongues.

            &quot;Maybe later,&quot; Fausta sighed.

            &quot;Yeah.&quot;  Felicity rested her head against her seat and took 
a short nap.  Her father would certainly disapprove of this course of 
action--riding in a car with a stranger just to scout for a player who 
might not even be there!--but right now, she didn&#39;t care.  He wasn&#39;t 
around and, God willing, he&#39;d never find out.  She slipped into a dreamy 
unconsciousness for a moment, but was woken up as the car came to a 
crawl and stopped.

            &quot;Everybody out!&quot; Warren shouted, rapping the windows like an 
eager frat boy.  &quot;We made pretty good time getting here, so let&#39;s not 
waste it.  Uh, ladies, quick:  names?&quot;  They introduced themselves to 
him (how silly of him to never ask!) and he started issuing commands.  
&quot;Okay, Fausta, dig through that jacket over there and find my cell 
phone.  Felicity, there should be a map underneath my seat.  I&#39;ll see if 
Tia can&#39;t remember the park where we found that girl...ah!  Thanks!&quot;

            It turned out that Tia Warren did not remember the park 
where they had spotted &quot;that one soccer player&quot;, nor did any of Arthur&#39;s 
maps help out.  Aside from historical sites, there were at least three 
parks in the general area, and two of them could certainly hold a few 
soccer fields.  As expected, Fausta and Felicity were asked to split up 
and explore one park each, so they all traded phone numbers and started 
walking.  Fausta was infuriated that she had been forced into a 
degrading task like this, while Felicity worried that her practice time 
was going down the drain.  She was so obsessed with how her father would 
react to this that she paid very little attention to the park or the 
people in it.

            Arthur Warren, in the meantime, was praying as he searched.  
He hoped that, if none of these parks was the one that &quot;the one soccer 
player&quot; frequented, then at least he would find it soon, and maybe 
squeeze in some time to speak with her.  He was pretty certain that a 
talent like hers must&#39;ve been scouted already, and she was no doubt 
living the high life in some fancy college, riding comfortably on her 
scholarship.  He had to try, though, because he believed in Rosewood&#39;s 
ambitions as well as Leena&#39;s skill.  Plus, it would really rub dirt in 
the Chairman&#39;s face!  As he entertained these thoughts, he came across a 
game being played, completely by chance, and decided to watch.  One team 
was falling behind by two points, and he later learned that this was the 
second half, and there were only fifteen minutes left in the game.

            Then, somebody called out, &quot;I found her!&quot;, and presented a 
fairly tall, fit, black-haired woman, wearing an oversized torn man&#39;s 
shirt and jeans that seemed far too large; she was forced to wrap a belt 
around them.  Arthur did a double-take and nearly fell on his back as he 
recognized a peculiar strand of silvery hair in her bangs, and knew that 
this was the same woman he had spotted a year ago.  But there was only 
one way to be sure.

Growing up rough and unrefined, a woman who doesn&#39;t hesitate to fight.

She strongly believes in the underdog, going the distance, and tenacity.

Her family is a deformed jewel too precious to throw out.

Kasumi Beckett

            &quot;You can do it, Kasumi!&quot; one of the spectators shouted.  
&quot;Yeah, kick their butts!&quot;

            &quot;Hey, what are you bringing that slum trash in here for?  Is 
she gonna distract us and put out?  You really think that bitch can take 
us?  You outta your mind!&quot;

            &quot;They don&#39;t know who they&#39;re dealing with, Kasumi!  Yeah, 
show em&#39; what you&#39;re made of!&quot;

            &quot;Haha, I bet she sucks balls better than she can kick them!  
Whaddya say, bitch?  Feel like giving the winning team a few blowjobs?  
Or maybe you like girls more!  Yeah, she can fuck some pussy if she 
loses!&quot;

            &quot;And who says humans aren&#39;t civilized anymore?&quot; Warren 
groaned.  But all jokes aside, his eyes were locked onto the dark-haired 
woman as she quietly stretched, jogged in place, and casually juggled 
the ball with her knees.  She certainly had a calm demeanor in spite of 
all the insults, but perhaps it was only a matter of time before the 
straw broke the camel&#39;s back.  The game resumed after a brief time-out, 
and as Arthur watched the woman called Kasumi, he reached into his 
pocket and dialed Felicity&#39;s number.

The game ended with a dramatic victory for the underdog team.

Arthur&#39;s quest was at an end.

--Kasumi Beckett, 20, Undeclared, striker position--

            Instead of prowling around the soccer field scoping out 
their potential teammates, most of the other players had better things 
to do:  Lauren was relaxing with several friends in her dorm, Nadia was 
covering Felicity&#39;s shift, Elisa was reading a romance novel, and Terra 
was brushing up on her Tae Kwon Do.  Out of all the girls, Terra 
probably had the least number of friends, but only because she had left 
so many of them behind, and was just now starting her life as an 
independent being, away from family and all the familiar things.  She 
was happy to discover a martial arts dojo in the area, although she 
wondered if she&#39;d be able to invest any time there, since she now had 
school, work, and practice devouring her precious time.  She managed, 
though, and she even made a new friend in the process.

            It all started when Terra humbly showed off a few of her 
skills.  She had a third-degree black belt, and a few of her teachers 
had entertained ideas of her turning pro, or even going to Olympic 
games.  Most of these students were rather embarrassed to see an 
average-looking young woman handling techniques they could never master, 
but one had a smirk on her face, and watched very intently.  The 
instructor called on her next--the group generally regarded her as their 
&quot;shy sempai&quot;, and even though she detested the attention she got, the 
woman performed just as well as Terra, if not better.

            Instead of feeling jealous and petty, Terra was inspired and 
attracted by the woman&#39;s exceptional speed and strength, and even though 
she was normally reserved, she couldn&#39;t pass up the chance to meet 
someone like this.  She looked pretty cute, but she wore &quot;street&quot; 
clothes to put up the impression of being tough or cool; however, her 
left shoulder was bare, revealing a solemn wolf.  Terra caught her 
attention, bowed, and smiled awkwardly.  She had no idea how this other 
woman would receive her, and didn&#39;t want to cause offense.

            &quot;Uh, hello.  You were excellent out there.  Uh, I hope 
that&#39;s not a strange thing to say.  I mean, I just thought it was really 
great, is all--not like in a &quot;cool&quot; sense, but like...you&#39;ve got real 
talent.  Um...is any of this making sense?&quot;

            &quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; she nodded.

            &quot;Oh.  Uh, so anyway, I was thinking about joining up--I 
mean, I guess I&#39;m pretty good, too--and, uh, so I guess we&#39;ll be on the 
same team, or whatever.&quot;

            &quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; she nodded again.  Terra sighed.  In spite of her 
clumsiness, however, she was performing better than expected.  She just 
wished she had a better response from the other girl.

            &quot;So anyway, I&#39;m Terra, or at least that&#39;s what my friends 
call me.  I think we&#39;re the same rank--third degree black belt, right?  
What&#39;s your name?&quot;

            &quot;Mmn,&quot; she sighed.  Her shoulders drooped and she hung her 
head, summoning up the courage to reveal herself.

Orphaned at a young age, victim of violence, she prays for respite.

She only confides in animals, for she trusts their pure souls.

Helping others is her raison d&#39;&ecirc;tre, her driving force.

Amy Nguyen

            &quot;Are you Vietnamese?&quot; Terra asked in her native language.  
Amy nodded but didn&#39;t respond in kind.

            &quot;I w-was born there, b-but my f-family m-m-moved when I was 
t-t-t-two.  I d-d-don&#39;t kn-know much V-Vietnamese.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.  Um, so how long have you been into martial 
arts?&quot;

            &quot;S-since I was th-th-thirteen.&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re very good,&quot; Terra smiled.  She giggled and added, 
&quot;You should be on the soccer team as well!&quot;

            &quot;W-w-what team?&quot; Amy asked.  Terra explained it to her--but 
not in the jilted, choppy, shaky dialogue she had used before; Terra 
became animated and livid, gesturing wildly and even smiling.  She was 
truthfully shy, but only around strangers; she could easily open up and 
become the life of the party, providing her friends were around or she 
had an attentive audience.  She soon realized how differently she was 
acting, and calmed down so the rest of the students wouldn&#39;t stare.

            &quot;Sorry.  I&#39;m just excited, is all.  I&#39;ve got a nice job, I&#39;m 
away from my tight-ass family, and in spite of all my misgivings, I made 
it to the team.  Thanks for putting up with my rambling.&quot;

            &quot;Y-you shouldn&#39;t s-s-say such things ab-b-bout your 
f-f-family.  At least y-you have one.  Y-you&#39;re l-lucky.&quot;  Terra was 
stricken; she felt idiotic and low.

            &quot;Uh...I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t know.  But they&#39;re really awful, 
Amy, they really are.  Sometimes, nothing is better than something, you 
know?&quot;

            &quot;N-no!&quot; she exclaimed fitfully.  &quot;Y-your family is th-th-the 
most imp-p-portant thing you have!  Y-y-you sh-should cherish it 
wh-wh-while they&#39;re still ar-r-round!&quot;  She started to gasp for air; now 
Terra felt worse.  She didn&#39;t mean to get Amy so riled up, and while she 
did apologize again, and admitted that &quot;most&quot; families were probably 
great, she would never have anything good to say about her own.

            &quot;Anyway, it seems we&#39;ve gotten off on the wrong foot.  You 
seem like a really nice person, and I didn&#39;t mean to upset you.  Can you 
forgive me?&quot;  Amy nodded firmly--not because she was exceptionally 
merciful, but because she believed it was the right thing to do.  Terra 
sighed with relief and thanked her.  &quot;So now that we&#39;ve patched things 
up, do you go to school anywhere?&quot;

            &quot;Y-yes, actually, I&#39;m g-g-going to C-C-Carnegie.&quot;  Terra&#39;s 
face lit up like an angelic host.

            &quot;Oh, really?!  That&#39;s where I&#39;m going!  Is this your first 
year?&quot;  Amy nodded.  &quot;Wow, mine too!  I guess we&#39;ll be seeing more of 
each other.  What classes are you taking?&quot;

            &quot;B-biology, ch-chemistry, some engin-n-n-neering courses, 
and basic m-medicine.&quot;

            &quot;Holy crap,&quot; she paled, &quot;you&#39;ve gotta be like a genius or 
something!&quot;  Amy grinned and blushed, refusing the compliment.  &quot;I&#39;m 
taking Computer Graphics, Object-Oriented Programming, Calculus, some 
Japanese, and of course, the general education requirements!  I&#39;m also 
taking a bit of music theory.  Uh...say, Amy, would it be too forward of 
me to invite you to soccer try-outs later today?  Just for fun, of 
course.  I mean, if a girl like me can make it, you&#39;d probably do even 
better!&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ve n-never thought ab-b-bout it bef-f-fore,&quot; she 
confessed quietly.

            &quot;At least give it some thought,&quot; she negotiated.  She 
decided to go out on a limb and gave Amy her phone number; she didn&#39;t 
know why.  The two of them barely knew each other, but in spite of their 
difference in opinion, there was definitely a connection as well.  Amy 
vowed that she would come with Terra later on and try out, but made no 
further guarantees.

--Amy Nguyen, 18, Biochemical engineer Major, no position--

            &quot;Excuse me.  You&#39;re Kasumi, right?  The so-called &#39;secret 
weapon&#39;?&quot;

            The dark-haired woman with a silver streak in her hair 
turned around, moving into a defensive position as she glared at the 
suspicious man.  He was about the same age as her father, and while he 
didn&#39;t seem like the physical type, he had a somewhat sleazy expression 
in his eyes, like he was mentally undressing the young woman.  Kasumi 
had dealt with perverts before, and when she did, she never had to deal 
with them again.

            &quot;And what if I am?&quot; she demanded.

            &quot;Oh, just wondering.  I&#39;ve got this proposal if you&#39;re 
interested.&quot;

            &quot;No thanks, creep,&quot; she snorted.  &quot;I don&#39;t go for men like 
you.  In fact, the whole gender seems to bug me.  Get lost.&quot;  She turned 
around and hastily jogged away, ignoring the compliments her teammates 
threw at her.  The pervert--poor old Arthur Warren--just stood there 
smiling in defeat, scratching the stubble around his jaw.

            &quot;Boy, if I had a dollar for every time that&#39;s happened!  It 
looks like I&#39;ll have to do things the hard way.  Let&#39;s hope those two 
girls are up for a little bit of espionage.&quot;

            While Arthur schemed away, Kasumi found her bicycle and rode 
home, away from the park and into a seedier side of town, the type 
tourists didn&#39;t usually see.  She stopped in front of Nathan Hale 
apartments, home sweet home, and not being the type to trust such an 
artifact to chance, she hefted her bicycle into the building, up a 
flight of stairs (only one, thank God), and laid it beside the front 
door, where it would stay until tomorrow.  Since her father wasn&#39;t home, 
and she didn&#39;t have to work, Kasumi decided to make dinner herself, and 
went hunting through creaky cupboards and a rusty fridge for something 
nice.  There was one particular recipe she wanted to try--but oh, she 
left it in her room (delays, delays).  She took her shoes and socks off, 
and strolled over the ugly carpet, down a hallway and into--

            Wait a second!  There&#39;s someone in the game room!  Oh, shit, 
are we being robbed?  Damn it!  Gotta go back to the kitchen for a 
knife--

            &quot;Kasumi!&quot; she heard someone call, a voice that froze her in 
her tracks.  Dad!  &quot;Come on over here!  There&#39;s someone who wants to 
meet you!&quot;  She slowly backtracked and inched her head through the 
doorway, eyes wide and fists curled.  Her father was definitely home, 
and he was chatting with someone--no, three people, two women her age 
and...

            &quot;Holy shit, you&#39;re that pervert from the park!&quot; she 
screamed.

            &quot;Language, young lady!&quot; her father barked.  Arthur Warren 
smiled cheerfully.

            &quot;Yo!  Wasn&#39;t it lucky that I ran into your old man, Miss 
Kasumi Beckett?  Us old foxes seemed to hit it off right away!&quot;

            &quot;Dad, what the hell is HE doing here?  And who the hell are 
these other two people?!&quot;

            &quot;I told you to watch your language, Kasumi,&quot; he warned her.  
&quot;Now please, dear, stop being bashful and get in here!  These people 
came all the way from out of state just to see you!  The least you can 
do is hear him out.&quot;  Kasumi was still a little hesitant and pale, so 
she crept in carefully and chose to lean against the wall, as far away 
from the &quot;visitors&quot; as she could.  She crossed her arms and glared at 
Warren, but then decided to take a closer look at the women, and focused 
mainly on them while the men lectured.

            Wow, they&#39;re both so gorgeous!  I wonder what they&#39;re doing 
with this old guy!  They can&#39;t be his daughters, can they?

            &quot;I&#39;m sorry for her behavior,&quot; Randy Beckett sighed.  &quot;My 
daughter&#39;s gotten tough from growing up in a neighborhood like this, and 
she doesn&#39;t usually trust people.&quot;

            &quot;You can&#39;t really blame her,&quot; Fausta snorted as she gave 
Arthur a sharp nudge.  &quot;Remind me--who approached her like a lecherous 
old man?!&quot;

            &quot;I said I had a proposal for her, not that I was gonna make 
one.  Anyway, if I caused the wrong impression, I&#39;m sorry.  My name is 
Arthur Warren, and I&#39;m a history teacher from Carnegie University.  We 
don&#39;t have much time, Miss Beckett, so I&#39;ll get straight to the point.  
The school I&#39;m representing is starting a new sports program, and we&#39;re 
trying to recruit great soccer players like you for our team.  When I 
saw you playing, I knew we had to have you on our side.  You might even 
say that we need you, Miss Beckett.  I know that a talent like yours 
must&#39;ve been wooed by every university from coast to coast, but if 
there&#39;s anything we can do to get you to play for us, just name it!&quot;

            &quot;Don&#39;t be so stupid,&quot; she muttered, clenching her eyes shut 
as she bared her teeth.  Kasumi was shaking, surprised, and a little 
angry.  &quot;Do you really think I&#39;m that good?  That I&#39;m just sitting here 
biding my time until I decide where I want to go with my life?  That I 
can have my...pick of the litter?  Get real, old man.  Colleges like 
that don&#39;t care about...about gutter-trash like me.  They don&#39;t give a 
sh...a care about my sports record, or even my academic record.  It all 
boils down to money--money, money, nothing but fucking money!&quot;

            &quot;Kasumi,&quot; Randy sighed.

            &quot;Sorry, dad--but it&#39;s true.  We barely have enough to scrape 
by on, and now these people come here dangling this carrot in front of 
me.  It&#39;s probably another private school for spoiled little rich brats!  
Well you can just tell your fucking Dean--sorry, dad--that I&#39;m too good 
for your sh...your garbage school.  I&#39;m going to my room.&quot;

            &quot;Now hold on!&quot;  Warren bolted to his feet, his voice 
authoritarian and austere, something that stunned Fausta and Felicity.  
&quot;I apologize if I gave you the wrong impression again, but you have to 
understand that Carnegie University wants you to attend and play soccer.  
Your father has shown me your academic records, and they&#39;re more than 
sufficient to get you in.  There just happens to be a scholarship for 
people like you, Miss Beckett:  a full scholarship.&quot;

            When Kasumi showed her face again, it was still hard as 
stone, but tears were brimming in her eyes, and they gracefully fell 
down, softening her expression.

            &quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you I&#39;d do anything to get you to come?&quot; 
Warren grinned coolly.  &quot;Carnegie is more than willing to bend over 
backwards for you, Miss Beckett, and as an instructor, let me be the 
first to assure you that this is not some private school for snobs.  I 
mean, they did hire a guy like me to teach there!  But I can&#39;t force 
you.  You have to come to the decision yourself.  I will say that if you 
agree, you&#39;ll have people like this at your side...&quot;  He pointed at 
Fausta and Felicity, who had not been able to speak on their behalf yet.  
&quot;And as an added bonus,&quot; Warren concluded with a laugh, &quot;you won&#39;t have 
to deal with me unless you take history!  A man coaches the men&#39;s team, 
and a woman--a hell of a woman, I might add--coaches the women&#39;s team.  
So now comes the hard part.  You&#39;ve gotta decide, Miss Beckett.  We only 
have a week left to recruit a full team.&quot;

            Something must be understood about Kasumi before she says 
anything.  She had been living in that stinking hovel for ten years, 
putting up with crime, mugging, potential rapists, drug dealers, 
constant sirens, and the worst that humanity had to offer.  It was a 
living Hell, and yet she tried making the best of it, always 
concentrating on her dreams of moving out to a better world, finding a 
real purpose in life, making friends who cared about her--maybe even 
falling in love.  Playing soccer was actually the humblest of her goals; 
all she really wanted was to be happy, and to be at peace.  At twenty 
years old, barely living above the poverty line, she was afraid that her 
chances at getting into college were slim, if not nonexistent.  She 
yearned to break away from DC, away from her job, away from this 
pointless life of hers...and now it was being offered to her on a silver 
platter.

            She looked into her father&#39;s eyes as she took a breath and 
sealed her fate.

            &quot;There they are,&quot; Leena exclaimed in relief.  She looked at 
the women she had recruited for the day--a decidedly smaller number than 
before--and clapped her hands, drawing their attention.  &quot;Well, ladies, 
now we&#39;ll find out if we get another volunteer or not.  Of course, this 
wait would&#39;ve been much easier if Mr. Warren had remembered to call me, 
but I digress.&quot;

            Amy Nguyen stood off by herself as she watched a middle-aged 
man and two girls her own age--a brunette and an Italian woman--emerge 
from the vehicle.  The man, presumably Mr. Warren, faced Leena and waved 
his arm in the air, flashing a thumbs-up.  Then a tall, dark-haired 
woman came out of the car, crossing her arms defensively, looking like 
all of this was too good to be true.  After speaking with this girl for 
a few minutes, Leena happily added another name to her list.
