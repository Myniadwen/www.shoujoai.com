<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 22 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>The next couple of weeks sped by a lot quicker than Kris expected. Sarah 
met up with her every morning at the front of the school and left with 
her at the end of the day. The two of them spent more and more time 
together with each passing day. Kris could tell that Sarah was worried 
about Jason taking revenge on the two of them which was why the girl 
stuck to her like glue. Kris didn&#39;t mind the attention as much recently. 
She did wish though that Tanya could be one of her friends again. 

During the last week before the dance the two of them talked about 
whether they should dress up as something or if they should just come as 
they were. In the end they both decided that they would surprise each 
other. On the final day Kris needed to go home and decided that since 
the dance wasn&#39;t until later that night they would meet up later on. 
Sarah walked with Kris part of the way to the girl&#39;s apartment.

&quot;There is where I live.&quot; Kris pointed to a set of apartment buildings 
off in the distance.

&quot;So you walk from there everyday?&quot; Sarah asked trying to think of 
something to talk about. 

&quot;It really is not that far.&quot; Kris proclaimed, &quot;Only about ten minutes or 
so for me.&quot; She smiled. 

&quot;I should get back home,&quot; Sarah suddenly stopped and nervously looked at 
her friend, &quot;So you&#39;ll be here at 7 pm right? You promise?&quot; Part of her 
was worried that Kris was going to go home and never return. 

&quot;I just want to have a bath and get dressed.&quot; Kris answered, &quot;I&#39;ll be 
back before you know it. It should not take me too long. I&#39;ll make sure 
to get here around quarter to 7 alright? Will you meet me here or should 
we meet up at the school?&quot; Kris casually asked like she went to dances 
all the time. In fact she had only been to one other dance and that was 
in Junior High with Jenn. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be here with my brother.&quot; Sarah looked at the sky and noticed how 
dark it was already, &quot;My parents are afraid of me walking around the 
neighborhood at night so he said he&#39;d watch out for me while they are 
away for the weekend.&quot;

&quot;Must be nice to have a brother like that.&quot; Kris mentioned looking up at 
the sky.

Sarah stuck out her tongue, &quot;Nah, he&#39;s a pain. He just graduated from 
college and hangs around the house all the time. My parents even rented 
out the basement to him now that he has a job. I wish he would go away 
so I wouldn&#39;t have to fight with him over the bathroom.&quot; 

Kris laughed. The sound startled her. She tried to wipe the smile off 
her face which caused Sarah to also break into laughter. Kris began to 
slowly walk backwards not wanting to take her eyes off of Sarah. She 
turned to look towards her apartment, a few street lights had turned on 
and she could see her building glowing in the twilight. She turned back 
around to Sarah before running off, &quot;Your brother will be here right?&quot; 
She didn&#39;t want to admit it, but she was afraid of the dark.
She felt like at any moment something would jump out of the shadows and 
grab her. 

Sarah nodded &quot;Yes, now hurry up and go home so you can get back in 
time.&quot; 

Kris jumped twice on one foot then turned and broke into a light sprint, 
&quot;I&#39;ll see you soon.&quot; She called out waving to the girl over her 
shoulder. She poured on the speed, running as fast as her legs would let 
her. Still, by the time she got home the moon was high in the sky and 
the sky was black except for a small patch of red clouds on the horizon. 

Kris forwent the elevator and quickly ran up the stairs, taking two at a 
time. Upon reaching her floor she pulled out her keys and rushed into 
the apartment. She flicked on a light and tossed her jacket to the floor 
before entering the kitchen. Her cat wrapped itself around her ankles as 
she opened the fridge where she found herself a couple of eggs and 
decided that they would do for now. Kris grabbed a cast iron frying pan 
and dropped it on a burner and turned the heat on full. Leaving the 
frying pan to heat up, she stripped off her clothes and added them to 
the pile in the corner. At first she grabbed her favorite dress shirt 
from the closet, the one Jennifer gave her, looked at it for a moment 
then tossed it back into the closet. She pulled a different top over her 
arms, not bothering to button it up, and ran back into the kitchen. 
Breaking three eggs open and letting them drop into the pan. They 
sizzled upon hitting the cast iron. Grabbing a spatula she
flipped the eggs twice. She was in such a rush that grease splashed out 
of the pan and hit her in the stomach. Kris bit her lip against the pain 
and grabbed the frying pan with her bare hand. The pan was so hot that 
it caused her to drop it in the middle of the stove. Cursing to herself 
she turned on the cold water and stuck her hand into the sink. With her 
free hand she grabbed a towel, soaked it and placed the towel against 
her stomach. 

Kris stood there for a moment standing in her underwear with her hand 
under the stream of water and wet towel dripping down her legs and 
laughed. &quot;Why couldn&#39;t I start to feel pain on another day?&quot; She snarled 
to herself, &quot;Why did it have to be on a day when I&#39;m in a rush of all 
things?&quot; Using her burnt hand to hold the towel in place she used her 
now free hand to scoop out the eggs onto a plate, then set the plate 
down on a chair and sat down next to it. She took a few deep breaths and 
tried hard not to think about the pain and instead focused on trying to 
get something into her stomach before heading out the door. 

When Kris was done, she moved to the bathroom and filled the tub. Maybe 
a cold bath would heal the burns enough to face the dance. She found 
herself actually looking forward to the night, and she wasn&#39;t going to 
let a little burn stop her from going out. She stripped off the last of 
her clothes, then slipped into the cold water and sat there for a 
moment. There was a group of red circles across her tummy and her 
fingers were red as well, at any rate nothing blistered just yet so she 
felt she could still face the night ahead. 

After a quick bath she got dressed into the best clothes she could find 
in the house, which equated to a white silk shirt, black silken blazer, 
black tie, and black dress slacks. She brushed her curls back until they 
stayed in place leaving only one lock to fall in front of her eyes. Then 
grabbed her dress shoes. She felt she was ready to go, and still had an 
hour to kill, so she turned off the lights and sat in the dark watching 
the small digital clock on the shelf. The minutes felt like hours, the 
burns dulled from the sharp pains to a  tingling that she was sure she 
could easily ignore. Half an hour passed by, Kris got up and started 
towards the door. If she left now she would only be a little early, and 
right now that was better then sitting in the dark listening to herself 
wander, because if she let her mind think too much, she knew it would 
convince her of some stupid reason not to go. 

So she grabbed her keys, leather jacket, wallet and was out the door. 
She took her time walking down the stairs to the lobby, like she was on 
her way to  taking one of her normal nightly leisurely strolls through 
the street. She stopped at a cross walk that would take her to meet a 
girl that only a couple of months ago insisted she would never fall in 
love with. Was she really in love? Kris wasn&#39;t sure she could answer 
that question. Sarah was cute, however Kris couldn&#39;t think of the
girl in the same way as she did Jennifer. No one would be able to 
replace Jennifer. At least she wasn&#39;t trying to push herself onto Kris 
like Tanya did. Kris&#39;s heart started to hurt as she waited for the 
lights to change. She was about to turn back to her apartment and call 
the night when the lights suddenly turned green. Kris looked at the 
light for a moment. Part of her told her to run, however Kris was 
growing tired of running. She straightened her collar and stepped across 
the
street.                                                

Kris didn&#39;t realize that she was walking even slower than usual. 
Battling with the urge to take off in a different direction. Any 
direction. She didn&#39;t arrive at her destination until around ten to 
seven. She looked up to see Sarah standing under a street light in a 
long white gown that made her almost look like a ghost in the night. If 
it wasn&#39;t for the tall boy in a t-shirt and jeans, who Kris suspected to 
be Sarah&#39;s brother, standing next to the girl, Kris would have thought 
she was a
trick of her imagination. She stopped for a moment and watched the girl 
as the wind played with the hem of her dress. 

Sarah finally looked up to see Kris standing in the distance,&quot;You made 
it!&quot; Sarah gleefully said with a hop. Kris started to walk towards the 
girl again. Sarah was stopped when Kris came closer, &quot;Wow.&quot; She stood 
there staring at the girl.

Kris could not find the words to express how she was feeling. She could 
not take her eyes off of Sarah, she looked even more beautiful than ever 
before, &quot;Yeah, I guess I did.&quot; She said bashfully, &quot;A pair of flying 
eggs almost made sure I didn&#39;t.&quot; She laughed to herself.

Sarah didn&#39;t know if the girl was joking or not. Then her brother 
stepped forward, &quot;So this is little Sarah&#39;s new boyfriend.&quot; He smiled.

Sarah glared at her brother, &quot;Brother, what did I tell you!&quot; she snarled 
at the boy.

He put up his hands defensively, &quot;It was just a joke, cool down.&quot; He 
looked Kris over, &quot;I have to admit she looks sharp.&quot; He walked around 
Kris studying her, then returned to his sister&#39;s side and leaned over to 
whisper in her ear. &quot;Good to see you have some taste in girls.&quot; 

&quot;Will you quit it?&quot;Sarah yelled taking a swing at her bother only to 
have him ducking out of the way.

Her brother just laughed at his little sisters attempt to attack him and 
Kris wondered if this boy really was a college graduate. He didn&#39;t act 
old enough to be out of high school. He then turned to both of the 
girls, &quot;Come on you two, we have a dance to get you too.&quot; He started to 
walk towards the school with the girls following closely behind him. 

&quot;You... you look good.&quot; Sarah stuttered and blushed. 

&quot;You look beautiful.&quot; Kris ventured, her heart felt like it was going to 
pound out of her chest. Almost as if Sarah sensed her friend&#39;s distress 
she warily slipped her hand into Kris&#39;s. Kris looked down at the girl&#39;s 
hand then up at Sarah who was redder than before. Kris squeezed the 
girl&#39;s hand to reassure her that everything would be alright.

The group stopped at the corner of the school ground. A line up of teens 
could be seen entering the gym. Sarah&#39;s brother turned to his sister, 
&quot;So, what time do you think you&#39;ll need me to pick you up about? 
Ninish?&quot; He asked. 

Sarah looked at Kris then back at her brother, &quot;Can I call you when we 
are ready to go?&quot;

He smiled and gave the girl a wink. Kris noticed that he had the same 
smile as his sister, &quot;Sure thing, I&#39;ll be watching movies with a few 
friends. Mom said I could use the tv in the living room so you can find 
me there. Don&#39;t bother calling my number because I probably won&#39;t hear 
it.&quot; He turned to Kris, &quot;Take care of my sister and no funny stuff, you 
hear?&quot; He poked Kris on the nose before turning around laughing. 

&quot;Remember not to tell mom!&quot; Sarah called out after her brother. 

&quot;I won&#39;t.&quot; He said as he left the two girls alone. 

Sarah turned to Kris, &quot;Ignore him. He just likes to tease me.&quot; She froze 
as she noticed Jason walking towards them. She grabbed Kris by the arm, 
dragging her quickly into the school. 

They got in line and paid their fees before entering the auditorium 
turned dance floor. Actually it wasn&#39;t much of an auditorium, more like 
a second gym with a stage at one end. The lights were low and there were 
Halloween decorations hanging on the walls and from the ceiling. Music 
played loudly from speakers on stage where a DJ could be seen taking 
requests. A few kids were already dancing in the middle of the gym while 
others stood along the walls. For the most part the girls were on one 
side and the boys on the other. Kris felt herself smile because for the 
first time there would be an advantage to dating another girl. A small 
laugh escaped her lips. 

Sarah looked at her date, &quot;What is so funny?&quot; She inquired. 

Kris tried to wipe the smile from her face, &quot;Nothing, it was nothing.&quot; 
She looked up to see Shannon standing with the former Kris fan club. The 
news was that the Principal shut down the club and Shannon got three 
days detention for harassing Kris. Shannon saw Kris with Sarah and 
glared across the gym, however Kris had already turned away so didn&#39;t 
receive the greeting. Kris searched the crowd hard and was disappointed 
to see Tanya was nowhere in sight. She had heard that the girl was going 
to a Halloween dance at the youth group, but wished she could see the 
girl again.

The two girls ventured over to where the teachers had laid out a set of 
tables with chips and paper cups of soft drinks set out along it. Mr. 
Klark watched the girls from behind the table, he had a cape wrapped 
around his shoulders in a vain attempt to look like a vampire or at 
least that was what Kris thought, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see the two of you could 
make it.&quot; He smiled, &quot;Most of all you, Kris.&quot; He turned his grin to 
Kris, &quot;You are looking sharp. I almost didn&#39;t recognize you. How have 
things been going?&quot; 

Kris shrugged as she picked up a cup of what looked like orange juice, 
&quot;Better I guess.&quot; She said taking a sip of the drink noting that it was 
actually watered down orange pop. Kris turned to see Miss Thomson 
filling cups and setting them on the table. The councilor&#39;s jaw was 
almost on the floor when she saw the way Kris was dressed. Kris put her 
arm around Sarah&#39;s shoulder and smiled at her councilor. Sarah looked at 
Kris&#39;s arm, then up to see the councilor staring that them. Sarah 
nervously waved at Miss Thomson before grabbing a drink with one hand 
and Kris&#39;s hand with the other, dragging the girl to the other side of 
the gym. She leaned against the wall and took a long swallow of her 
drink. She noticed that she was still holding Kris&#39;s hand and quickly 
let go. 

&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to make you nervous.&quot; Kris apologized examining 
her own drink, &quot;I just couldn&#39;t help it when I saw the way Miss. Thomson 
disapproved with us being together.&quot; 

Sarah sipped at her drink, &quot;It&#39;s alright, I just wasn&#39;t prepared for 
it.&quot; It was obvious how nervous she was. She seemed to be fine outside, 
but now that they were around other people it was a different story all 
together. 

Kris watched the girl and wondered if this was such a good idea. Sure, a 
lot of girls and boys came with their friends, however none were famous 
for being openly gay at the school like she was. Kris could tell that 
there were a few gay kids amongst the crowds, nevertheless none of them 
showed up with a date of the same sex except for Kris. She was used to 
being stared at in this way but she doubted if Sarah could handle it. 
She started to wonder if maybe they should have gone to the gay dance 
instead. At least there they would be able to feel more comfortable, but 
it was too late to change their plans now and if they did go they would 
certainly run into Tanya for sure. Kris was not sure how the girl would 
take seeing her with Sarah. 

Song after song passed by and the two didn&#39;t say more than two words to 
each other. A slow song finally started and Sarah&#39;s ears perked up as 
the gym filled with sound of the tell tale piano music of Bryan Adam&#39;s 
&quot;Everything I do (I do it for you)&quot; Sarah set her cup on a bench 
slipping her other hand into Kris&#39;s and pulled the girl onto the dance 
floor. 

&quot;Whoa, Hey, I don&#39;t dance.&quot; Kris protested tossing her empty cup into a 
passing garbage bin, &quot;Sarah?&quot; Before she knew it, they were in the 
middle of the dance floor. 

Sarah wrapped her arms around Kris&#39;s neck, &quot;Come on, it&#39;s just one 
song.&quot; She pleaded looking Kris in the eyes. Kris looked around to see 
if anyone was watching them, everyone was too busy dancing with their 
own partners to notice the two of them so she gave in. 

Kris looked down at Sarah amused, &quot;You are weird, you know?&quot; She 
mentioned with a half smile.

Sarah pulled back, &quot;I am not... I just...&quot; She blushed as she felt her 
eyes fall on Kris&#39;s. As the song played Sarah couldn&#39;t take her eyes off 
the girl in front of her. The two stared at each other while the music 
played in the background. Kris closed her eyes and Sarah heard the girl 
begin to softly sing. Sarah looked around to see if anyone else could 
hear and when she was sure that the song was only for her ears she 
turned back and set her head on Kris&#39;s shoulder and enjoyed her voice. 

The song came to a close and most of the kids moved off of the dance 
floor. Kris and Sarah held hands as they moved to a small set of stairs 
that led up to the back stage. They stood in the stairwell and didn&#39;t 
say a word. Kris sat on the stairs and watched the other kids dance. 
Sarah joined her and rested her head on Kris&#39;s shoulder. 

After a few more songs Kris slowly stood up, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back, I just 
need to go to the washroom. Wait here, alright?&quot;

Sarah nodded and watched her friend disappear across the gym and out one 
of the doors. 

In the restroom, Kris washed her hands, splashed some water on her face 
and fixed her hair when she heard the door open and turned to see 
Shannon enter the room. She was dressed in a tight cat suit that showed 
how little the girl had developed for her age. 

&quot;Look at the Dyke!&quot; She snarled at Kris, &quot;Having fun with your new 
little girlfriend?&quot; 

Kris walked over to the girl, reached out, grabbed her by the throat and 
pulled the girl close to her face, &quot;You can call me names all you like, 
but if you ever try to hurt Sarah I will personally tear out your 
throat. Is that clear? And I am the insane one remember, so don&#39;t think 
I won&#39;t do it.&quot; She let go of the girl and walked out the door before 
Shannon could reply, across the hall and back into the auditorium. 

Sarah wasn&#39;t sitting in the stairwell where she left her. Kris nervously 
looked around the gym in search of the girl and spotted her near the 
snack table, talking to a small group of girls. Kris let out a sigh of 
relief as she cut through the middle of the dance floor and walked up 
behind Sarah. For some unexplained reason Kris suddenly flopped around 
Sarah&#39;s shoulder&#39;s. Sarah was so startled that she almost dropped her 
drink. 

&quot;Kris, you scared me!&quot; She exclaimed to the head on her shoulder. 

Kris smiled &quot;Isn&#39;t that what Halloween is all about?&quot; She didn&#39;t move 
her head from where it lay and wrapped an arm around the girl&#39;s waist. 
Sarah&#39;s friends looked amused at Kris&#39;s actions. Sarah introduced the 
group to Kris who waved. She then gave Sarah a slight squeeze before she 
went to find herself another drink. She was finally beginning to loosen 
up and was actually feeling like life might be turning around for her. 
She talked with a couple of girls from class that usually avoided her 
and danced to two more slow songs with Sarah. Before they knew it it was 
past 9:30 pm and a lot of the teens were already beginning to head on 
their way home. 

The two girls spilled out into the hall. Both of them were giddy with 
happiness. Either that or someone slipped something into the drinks, 
which was very unlikely because Kris couldn&#39;t go near alcohol and would 
have been sick instead of giddy. Kris fell against Sarah and pinned her 
to the wall. The hall was empty, so Kris took a chance to move in closer 
to the girl. Their heads touched and Kris could feel Sarah&#39;s breath 
against her lips. Their lips were only an inch away from touching when 
Sarah slipped out from between Kris&#39;s arms. 

&quot;I should call my brother,&quot; Sarah said nervously as she walked to the 
payphones that hung down the hall, &quot;He&#39;s probably getting worried.&quot; 

Kris nodded in disappointment, &quot;Yeah.&quot; She watched as Sarah turned and 
ran to the phones, then sunk to the floor and let out a sigh. She 
watched Sarah pick up the receiver and dial. Kris wondered to herself if 
maybe she was moving too fast. She&#39;s only known Sarah for not even a 
couple of months. She had to stop pushing herself on the girl, however 
she couldn&#39;t seem to help herself. Something inside her kept stirring. 
Sarah was just so pretty and she wanted nothing more than to feel her 
lips. Kris hit her head on the brick wall to stop the thoughts that 
tried to invade her mind. 

Sarah hung up the phone and skipped back over to where Kris sat, &quot;He 
said he will be here in a minute. We don&#39;t live very far away so he just 
has to get his shoes and jacket and he will be on his way.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Kris tried to force herself to sound trilled, however no matter 
how much she tried she just couldn&#39;t. She really didn&#39;t want the night 
to end just yet. Didn&#39;t want to return to the nightmare of her life. She 
got up and took Sarah by the hand. If she wasn&#39;t going to be able to 
kiss this girl on the lips today she will at least try to taste a piece 
of her before the night ended. Kris knelt and  lightly placed a kiss on 
Sarah&#39;s hand. She did it so quickly and gently that Sarah didn&#39;t have 
time to pull her hand away or protest. 

Sarah flushed, but didn&#39;t pull away. Kris looked up from the girl&#39;s hand 
and gazed her in the eyes. It looked like Sarah was about to fall over 
right there. Kris realized that maybe it wasn&#39;t the fact that Sarah 
wasn&#39;t in love with her, but more like the girl wasn&#39;t as... experienced 
as Kris was when it came to this kind of thing. For Kris dating was the 
hard part. She was unlucky enough to have had a father who had done 
everything else to her. 

Kris stood up, not letting go of Sarah&#39;s hand. Slowly the two of them 
walked down the hall and out the front door. The Principal was there to 
greet them a good night as the students started on their way home. Many 
ran off to see if they could still get some candy from the neighbors 
while others got into their parent&#39;s cars and headed straight home. 

The two girls were too busy looking at each other to notice that they 
were no longer on the school grounds and passed where they were supposed 
to meet up with Sarah&#39;s brother and instead they started to walk to 
Sarah&#39;s place themselves. 

The moonlight danced through the trees as the two girls walked along the 
road. Then something stepped out of the shadows and grabbed Sarah, 
pulling her out of Kris&#39;s hand. Kris could hear Sarah call out to her as 
fists hit her hard in the side. Kris fell to the road, scrapping her 
hands on the gravel. She tried to control her anger as a foot kicked her 
in the ribs causing her to roll into the curb. Kris tried to stand, 
attempted even harder to fight against the fog. It was like a nightmare 
come true. She looked around and tried to find Sarah as over and over 
again hard blows hit her. Finally she went down with her face in a 
puddle. She saw a bright light and heard feet running away. Everything 
suddenly turned dark and muddled.

Sarah dropped to Kris&#39;s side. &quot;Kris! Kris speak to me!&quot; She called out 
to her friend. 

Kris opened one eye to see Sarah kneeling over her. She pulled her face 
out of the mud, &quot;Did... did they hurt you?&quot; She asked through a veil of 
pain.

&quot;No, No they didn&#39;t.&quot; Sarah said shakily. Kris could see tears forming 
in Sarah&#39;s eyes, &quot; I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Sarah cried.

Kris forced herself to smile, &quot;It&#39;s alright... as long as you... are 
alright...&quot; She allowed the darkness to take a hold of her and collapsed 
to the ground.
