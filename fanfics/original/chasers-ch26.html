<a href="../original/chasers-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>        As Kate walked up the hallway in her apartment building she 
blinked in surprise as she heard a familiar sounding if rather irritated 
voice. &quot;The damn door doesn&#39;t even take messages?&quot; Gwen complained 
aloud, looking at the door angrily.

        &quot;Hey,&quot; Kate called out to her as she came around the corner, 
giving her boss a smile, &quot;the thing was chirpy and irritating, a fatal 
combination.&quot;

        &quot;One of there days,&quot; the elegant Asian woman shook her head, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to buy you a modern answering service and make you use it.&quot; 
Gwen sighed as Kate walked up to her, &quot;Could I talk to you for a 
moment?&quot;

        &quot;And here I was wondering what you were doing out here,&quot; Kate 
smiled, the rangy looking young woman producing an old fashioned 
key-card to unlock the door.

        &quot;You even took the voice recognition system out, too?&quot; Gwen 
blinked as she followed the sandy brown haired woman inside.

        &quot;That was a rhetorical question, right?&quot; Kate smiled as she 
waved Gwen inside, &quot;No lectures, please, I get enough of that from 
Beth.&quot; Kate walked towards the kitchen as she asked, &quot;Do you want 
something to drink?&quot;

        &quot;Whatever you have that&#39;s cold,&quot; Gwen calmly answered. She moved 
into the living room, taking a seat in one of the battered chairs. The 
place wasn&#39;t bad looking, but it was rather like going back in time a 
few decades.

        &quot;Here you go,&quot; Kate came in with two cans of soda, passing one 
over to Gwen. She sat down in the other seat, &quot;So what can I do for 
you?&quot;

        Gwen took the can with a gracious, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She tapped it 
once, the seal clearing, then took a delicate drink. &quot;I just wanted to 
let you know you don&#39;t need to go in today,&quot; she explained, &quot;and your 
answering machine isn&#39;t working.&quot;

        &quot;Huh,&quot; Kate took a more vigorous drink of her own can, &quot;guess 
the bosses don&#39;t want us there, considering the leak. What happens if 
there&#39;s an emergency?&quot;

        &quot;I get paged,&quot; Gwen shrugged, &quot;then we&#39;ll have to see.&quot; She took 
another drink, looking up to coolly meet Kate&#39;s thoughtful gaze.

        &quot;You aren&#39;t thinking of not answering an emergency call, are 
you?&quot; Kate drawled out, a slight smile teasing her lips.

        &quot;I think the Chief needs a little reminder why I talked him into 
forming the Chasers in the first place,&quot; Gwen said gravely.

        &quot;You know you&#39;re going to get in trouble,&quot; Kate pointed out, 
taking a slurp of her drink and leaning back casually in her seat.

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Gwen shrugged, &quot;but I&#39;ve been in trouble before.&quot; 
She took a drink, &quot;The force needs us more than we need them.&quot;

        Kate chuckled wickedly. &quot;Well, if you need a spear carrier for 
this little brawl,&quot; she said, &quot;give me a call, I&#39;ll back your play.&quot;

        Gwen turned the can in her hands, then took another drink. She 
looked over at Kate, &quot;Do you think I did the right thing, forming the 
Chasers?&quot;

        Kate blinked, &quot;Are you getting philosophical on me?&quot;

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Gwen sighed. &quot;If the Chasers weren&#39;t 
around, the freewills wouldn&#39;t be in the situation that they are, with 
the threat of the police going after them hanging over their heads.&quot; She 
hesitated, &quot;And Lynn would still be alive.&quot;

        Kate had the oddest look on her face, her sandy hair falling 
into her eyes. &quot;Or maybe Lynn would have gone after that killer anyway,&quot; 
she finally said softly, &quot;and had to have done it without the training 
you and I gave her.&quot;

        To say that Gwen was surprised by that would be something of an 
understatement. She took another drink, finishing off the can of soda 
before saying, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have expected to hear that answer just a few 
months ago.&quot;

        &quot;Your friend Alexis is a pretty good headshrinker,&quot; Kate 
acknowledged. &quot;And it helps, knowing that we got the bastard that did 
it,&quot; she added.

        &quot;That we did,&quot; Gwen quietly agreed. She gave Kate a slight 
smile, &quot;We&#39;ve never talked about this before, have we?&quot;

        Kate got up out of her chair, walking over to the window to look 
out at the city. &quot;I wasn&#39;t ready to talk about it before,&quot; she admitted, 
&quot;I was still too wrapped up in my pain.&quot;

        &quot;You do seem happier,&quot; Gwen noted. She smiled slightly, &quot;Is it 
because of your new friend in lowtown, or maybe a fellow officer?&quot;

        Kate fought back a blush as she replied with as much dignity as 
she could muster, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about.&quot; She looked 
back at Gwen and smirked, &quot;And are you and Alexis getting back 
together?&quot;

        Gwen laughed softly, &quot;No, I don&#39;t think so.&quot; She paused, a 
slight smile appearing on her face as she continued, &quot;I think we&#39;re 
becoming friends.&quot;

        &quot;You weren&#39;t before?&quot; Kate asked, noticing that Gwen was out of 
soda. She retrieved two more cans, carrying them back over to where she 
sat.

        &quot;We were just ex-lovers,&quot; Gwen shook her head firmly, &quot;there was 
a period of time when we weren&#39;t even talking.&quot;

        &quot;You almost sound like Jen and her ex,&quot; Kate noted, sitting down 
across from her as she put the drinks down. &quot;So you&#39;re not seeing 
anyone?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;No,&quot; Gwen said, a slight blush appearing on her cheeks. &#39;I have 
been noticing someone lately, but I am not telling you that,&#39; she 
thought.

        &quot;Too bad,&quot; Kate said as a soft knock came on the door. She got 
up to her feet with a scowl, &quot;What is this? This is the most visitors 
I&#39;ve had in weeks.&quot;

        The door swung open, and Jen blinked up at her in surprise. &quot;Ah, 
hi,&quot; the pretty blonde smiled, &quot;I was trying to get a hold of you, but 
there was no answer.&quot;

        Kate smiled wryly, &quot;So you had to come all the way over here?&quot; 
Not waiting for an answer she stepped aside to let her by, &quot;Come on in, 
join the party.&quot;

        &quot;Party?&quot; Jen repeated, taking a hesitant step inside the 
apartment. She saw Gwen sitting there and stiffened slightly, &quot;Ma&#39;am!&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s Gwen,&quot; the elegantly dressed Asian woman reminded her. She 
smiled, picking up her can, &quot;Besides, we&#39;re all off duty here.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry, Gwen,&quot; Jen blushed faintly. She stood there hesitantly a 
moment, taking in Gwen&#39;s clearly relaxed posture. She looked over at 
Kate, &quot;I guess I came over at a bad time.&quot;

        &quot;No, no,&quot; Kate shook her head, &quot;we were just talking.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re certainly welcome to join us,&quot; Gwen offered, holding up 
a can of soda.

        Jen looked between Kate and Gwen, then she walked back to the 
door. &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll catch up with you at work,&quot; she said to Kate. She 
looked over to Gwen, &quot;And I got your message not to go in tomorrow, 
thanks.&quot; With that, she was out the door and gone.

        &quot;What was that about?&quot; Kate blinked, standing there looking 
clearly confused.

        Gwen sighed, &quot;I think Jen may have jumped to certain 
conclusions.&quot; At Kate&#39;s continued confusion she elaborated, &quot;I mean, 
about why I&#39;m here in your apartment.&quot;

        Kate looked at her in shock, &quot;What?!&quot;

        Gwen couldn&#39;t help it, the stunned look on Kate&#39;s face was just 
priceless. She giggled softly, chuckled, then finally began to laugh 
aloud. Kate kept a dour look on her face for awhile, then she began to 
see the humor in the situation, too.

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Gwen managed to get her laughter under control, wiping 
at the tears in her eyes.

        &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Kate conceded, &quot;it is pretty funny, in a twisted 
sort of way.&quot; She flopped back down in her seat, &quot;Wonder how I&#39;m going 
to explain this tomorrow?&quot;

        &quot;Tell her the truth,&quot; Gwen advised with a smile, &quot;that you and 
your friend were talking and having something to drink, and that&#39;s all.&quot;

        &quot;Jen probably won&#39;t believe it, though,&quot; Kate noted.

        &quot;That&#39;s not my fault,&quot; Gwen shrugged. She finished her second 
can off, then got up to stretch, &quot;I&#39;d better get going, before I get you 
in trouble again.&quot;

        &quot;Not a problem,&quot; Kate said quite seriously as she walked Gwen to 
the door. &quot;If you do need to get in trouble with the Chief,&quot; she 
reminded Gwen of their earlier conversation, &quot;I&#39;ll back your play.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Gwen smiled at her, &quot;that means a lot.&quot;

        &quot;Nah,&quot; Kate waved her hand casually before she flashed Gwen a 
sudden grin, &quot;I just love being in the middle of a good fight.&quot;

        Gwen stepped out into the hallway, then looked back at her. 
&quot;There isn&#39;t anyone who I&#39;d rather have watching my back,&quot; she said 
simply. With that she strode down the hall, leaving a thoughtful Kate 
leaning against the doorway.
