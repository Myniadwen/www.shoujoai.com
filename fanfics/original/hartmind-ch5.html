<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Samantha opened her eyes to find herself sitting in the front passenger 
seat of a car. In her hands she held her Meephit, however it looked 
different then she remembered. She ran a hand across the creatures fur 
and noticed that it felt old and worn, as if the toy had been though 
many hand instead of fresh out of it package. She let her fingers trace 
over the toy&#39;s plastic eyes and could feel small bumps and scratches 
upon its surface. How could the creature suddenly age the way it had and 
where was she anyway? 

&quot;Don&#39;t you like your toy?&quot; A warm, loving, voice nervously inquired from 
the drivers seat. 

Samantha turned to see a strange woman smiling back at her. Here hair 
was black as ash and her skin fair and white. Samantha could see 
motherly love in the woman&#39;s eyes when she glanced her way, &quot;It is 
great, thank you mom.&quot; Sam heard herself suddenly say. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I could not afford a new one for you.&quot; The woman said 
dismally, &quot;Money is tight with your father gone.&quot; 

Samantha set her hand upon her mother&#39;s. &quot;Don&#39;t worry.&quot; She soothed, &quot;I 
love it. I really do. Thank you.&quot; 

The woman smiled at her then turned to face the road again. 

Sam puzzled over what had happened to her. She glanced out the window to 
see a familiar series of houses pass by. She was still in her hometown, 
but that did not explain the strange woman sitting next to her or the 
fact that she could not control her body. She caught a glimpse of 
herself in the car&#39;s side mirror and was stunned by what she saw. 
Staring back at her was the face of a beautiful young girl with long 
black hair that shone like strains of ebony and skin so pale that they 
make Beth look like she had a tan. The girl&#39;s eyes were dark blue with 
large eyelashes that nearly touched the girl&#39;s fine dark eyebrows. 
Samantha found herself transfixed by the image before her. Had she been 
reborn in a new body? Was this her birthday present after all the 
hellish things she had suffered through? She pondered over this as she 
stared down at the toy in her hand. Maybe it was this toy&#39;s doing. Could 
the Meephit have the power to transport her into a different body 
entirely? The thought of which was exciting and somewhat frightening. 
She tried to think of what to do when a voice entered her mind. 

((What are you doing in here?)) The voice gently inquired. 

Samantha looking around in search of the voices, she tried to speak but 
could not find her own voice. 

((Don&#39;t try to speak.)) The voice remarked calmly, ((Just think of what 
you wish to say.))

((W... who are you?)) Samantha thought, her own voice suddenly echoing 
in her mind. 

((I am Star.)) The voice stated, ((This is my body. I should be asking 
who you are?)) She added firmly. 

((What?!?)) Samantha tried to fathom how she could end up inside someone 
else&#39;s mind, ((I... I&#39;m sorry... I... I...)) She stammered, she did not 
know how one was supposed to act when they found themselves inside 
another&#39;s mind. 

&quot;Star, are you alright honey?&quot;  Star&#39;s mother asked, giving her daughter 
a curious look. 

Star smiled at her mother, &quot;I&#39;m fine mom.&quot; She replied, &quot;Just another 
lost soul trying to find its way home.&quot; 

The woman&#39;s smile faltered for a moment, &quot;Alright dear. Just help them 
along their way quickly.&quot; She nervously stated and she turned her eyes 
back to the road, &quot;We should be home soon.&quot;

((You&#39;re taking this rather well.)) Samantha remarked, thankful that she 
did not end up in a hostile mind, ((Although your mother seems to be bit 
uneasy.))

Star shrugged, ((It happened to me a few times as well, when I was 
younger.)) She remarked simply, ((She get&#39;s a little worried when other 
people enter my mind is all. Now, what is your name and do you remember 
how you got here?)) She inquired gently. 

((Oh, sorry...)) Samantha apologized for her rudeness, ((I&#39;m Samantha. I 
was heading home and suddenly the door opened and the next thing I know 
my mother hit me in the head with a vase.)) She frantically explained. 

((Ouch!)) Star cringed at the mere thought of the accident, ((Well 
Samantha, I am Star. It is nice to meet you. You probably were knocked 
out and you need to return to your body before it dies, along with 
you.)) She stated collectedly. 

Sam wondered how anyone could take something like this so calmly. She 
must have had to deal with a lot of death in her years in order to not 
be phased by the idea of meeting someone who may soon be dead, ((Do you 
know how I can get back to my body?)) She inquired worriedly. 

((Sometimes it&#39;s easy and others it isn&#39;t.)) Star stated weakly, ((Once 
I had a little boy&#39;s mind inside of my head for three months before I 
was able to return him to his body.))

Samantha shuddered at the idea of being trapped in someone else&#39;s mind 
for that long, ((I hope that won&#39;t happen this time.)) She remarked 
restlessly, ((Not to say you are not a nice girl, you are beautiful. I 
mean that is... Well...)) She felt herself flush and hoped that the girl 
did not notice. 

Sam felt Star blush, it was a warm feeling that made Sam smile to 
herself, ((Thank you...)) Star said shyly, ((I am sure you are pretty 
too.))

Sam shook her head dismally, ((I&#39;m rather boring looking.)) She 
explained solemnly, ((My hair is a pain and my body still looks like a 
child&#39;s. I hate the way I look.))

((Maybe I will get a chance to see for myself.)) Star remarked with a 
grin, ((Now is there anything else you remember before you blacked out? 
Like something you were holding or wearing that you felt a special 
attachment too, every small detail helps.)) 

Samantha glanced down at the stuffed toad in the girl&#39;s hands, ((I had a 
Meephit just the one you have, only it was newer.)) She mentioned 
curiously. 

Star held the toy up and looked at it, ((My mother picked this up from a 
garage sale. It was a gift for my sixteenth birthday, which is 
tomorrow.))

((Really!?!)) Samantha exclaimed excitedly, ((I got mine for my 
sixteenth birthday as well and guess what? It is tomorrow too. Wow!!)) 

((That is interesting.)) Star milled over what she had been told, ((Well 
then, let&#39;s see if this works. Try lightly closing your eyes and think 
about that toy. If we are lucky it is still close to you and you will be 
able to use it to track your body.))

((Are you sure this will work?) Sam inquired nervously, ((I mean what 
will happen if I get stuck in someone else&#39;s body?))

((Not likely to happen.)) Star informed the girl, ((Once you have 
grounded yourself in one person&#39;s body you are more likely to simply 
return to that body if you don&#39;t find your own. If that happens we will 
just try to find another way to work things out.)) She explained. 

Samantha was still sceptical of the plan, but decided it was better then 
nothing, ((I&#39;ll try it then.)) She half-heartedly agreed. 

Star gave a warm smile, ((It was nice meeting you, Samantha.)) She said, 
((I hope to be able to meet you again in the future.))

((I like the thought of that.)) Samantha stated then frowned, ((That is 
to meet up in my real body and not return to your mind... you know...)) 

Star nodded, ((I know what you mean. Good luck)) 

Samantha lightly closed her eyes and tried to concentrate on the feeling 
of that strange toy. She could feel its warmth in her hand and the 
fuzziness of its body against her fingers. She suddenly realized that 
its fur had returned to its original soft plush. Excitedly she focussed 
upon that feeling and her mind abruptly flew through the air. A world of 
Technicolor images rushed through her mind and she soared with the wind 
in her hair. Just as she was beginning to enjoy the feeling she abruptly 
stopped and began to fall from the sky. She was plunged into complete 
darkness as her body toppled downward at an increasing rate. Terrified 
of what was happening she clenched her eyes shut as she prepared for the 
inevitable impact, however her body landed upon something soft and 
bounced ever so slightly then settled back down again. 

&quot;I think she is coming too.&quot; A strange voice from above her said. 

Sam could feel a warm bed beneath her body and something soft in her 
right hand. Cautiously opened her eyes to see her Meephit was tightly 
gripped in her hand, its fur as new as she remembered it and its eyes no 
longer covered in scratched. She let out a sigh of relief at the sight 
of the things. For the first time she was glad to have the strange toy 
in her hands. Star was right; it was still close to her. Someone must 
have placed it in her hand while she lay unconscious. She smiled down at 
the creature.

&quot;Oh my, she has opened her eyes!!!&quot; Someone exclaimed in excitement. 
Samantha glanced up to see a tall, thin woman dressed in a nurse&#39;s 
uniform hovering over her with an expression of extreme happiness upon 
her face. 

&quot;I&#39;ll find a doctor.&quot; Another woman out of Samantha&#39;s sight said then 
rushed off. 
 
&quot;Samantha? Samantha can you hear me?&quot; The nurse called softly out to the 
girl.

&quot;W...who are you?&quot; Samantha choked. Her voice felt dry and her eyes 
darted around the room to find herself lying in a hospital with wires 
attached to her body, a tub coming out of her arm, another from her 
nose, and a monitor beeping over her head as many people rushing around 
her.

&quot;I am Nurse Janis.&quot; The woman stated, &quot;You had a bit of an accident.&quot; 
She explained softly, fluffing the girl&#39;s pillows and checking an IV on 
a pole next to her bed.

&quot;I want to go home.&quot; Samantha tried to sit up only to have the woman 
hold her down. 

&quot;You need to lay down.&quot; The nurse demanded, &quot;You have a nasty bump on 
your head and you are lucky to not be coma.&quot; 

&quot;Or worse...&quot; Samantha mumbled and touched the bandages upon her head 
and wincing at the pain that shot through her skull, &quot;How long was I out 
for?&quot; She asked through clenched teeth.

The nurse glanced at her watch, &quot;About eight or nine hours. It is two 
a.m. now. Happy birthday by the way.&quot; She congratulated the girl. &quot;You 
are now sixteen. How does it feel?&quot;

Samantha layback on the pillows as a wave of dizziness circled about her 
head, &quot;I didn&#39;t miss it.&quot; She breathed with sigh of relief. 

((I&#39;m glad to see you made it back.)) Star&#39;s voice echoed through her 
head, ((And you didn&#39;t miss your birthday either.)) Samantha could hear 
a smile upon the girl&#39;s voice.

Samantha&#39;s eyes opened wide in surprise, &quot;STAR!?!&quot; She exclaimed aloud, 
&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; 

The nurse jumped at the girl&#39;s words and looked around herself, &quot;Who are 
you talking to?&quot; She inquired frantically.

Star shrugged, ((Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m not in your body.)) Star assured the 
girl, ((However, our minds seem to be linked in some strange way. I&#39;m 
not sure how but it looks like we will get a chance to know each other 
after all.))

Samantha abruptly sat up, &quot;WHAT!?!&quot;
