<pre>Just another day in Tokyo, 1994...

On the suburban edge of Shibuya was a small but cosy little 
semi-detached. With an average door, an average hallway, an average dog 
(named Inuko) and an average chain of rooms that were meshed together to 
create an average Japanese household. The &#39;Endou&#39; household. Sounds kind 
of average, don&#39;t you think? Of course; out of the two people that 
currently lived in this household; one of them was not so average. 

And her beautiful little name was Minako Endou. 

The second bedroom to the right of the upstairs bathroom was her room. 
Just like the room of any other girl her age. Messy. The blue carpeted 
floor of Minako&#39;s room was covered with used fast-food wrappers, un-used 
schoolbooks, abused manga,  old soda cans and pink lace panties. You 
know the kind. The kind any average perv wants to have a sniff of from 
time to time. It was a total dump in that respect; but if I&#39;m gonna spin 
the tales of Minako Endou to you then you might as well get used to it 
from now. The young woman, no older than sixteen, snored roughly with a 
comically wide mouth. Limbs spread out all over her bed, her left leg 
hanging off the edge of it. Her wide mass of strawberry-blonde hair was 
messy and frayed; her thick eyelashes fluttering from the beam of light 
pouring onto her face from the gaps between her window curtains. They 
niggled at her. She seemed to be unaware that this was morning light. 
Monday morning light. Which also meant, horribly enough, school. And 
then the alarm clock did the waking up for her. A loud, almost deafening 
sound rang in the air of Minako&#39;s bedroom. And the young woman&#39;s drowsy 
emerald eyes shot open with a jarring swiftness. Bang. 

&quot;Wha...?&quot; 

The tired young woman&#39;s head slowly rose from the white pillow of her 
bed. One hand went to her face and slowly wiped the matter from her 
eyes. While the other hand went through the now tangled locks of her 
fire orange hair. That damn alarm clock might not have been very polite 
but it did its job. But this caused her to take a good look at the clock 
that had woken her up. Or rather the time that was on it. And Minako&#39;s 
eyes went wide with worry and surprise when she saw the exact time on 
it. 

&quot;Oh crap!&quot; Minako bellowed, &quot;It&#39;s 8.20! I overslept AGAIN!&quot;

Curse the charming allure of the bedspread. Minako scowled like a 
madwoman and pressed one palm into her mattress. The rest of her body 
swung straight over the bed with that arm as support, landing Minako 
down upon the messy bedroom floor of hers. But she couldn&#39;t deal with 
that right now. She swiftly ran to the other side of the room and dove 
into her chest of drawers. Everything was ironed out from last night, 
school uniform and all. So none of the aggravation of ironing her 
clothes out in the morning was needed today. Minako tossed the articles 
she needed from the drawer into the air. She double-backed a little, 
then grabbed them all, and began dressing. Ten minutes later she busted 
through the poster-laden door to her bedroom and began dashing around 
the banister of the upper floor, straight down the stairs to the lower 
floor of her house. As you can imagine, barging down the stairs at that 
speed makes a lot of noise. Minako&#39;s Father, Hiroyuki, with his nose and 
face buried inside a newspaper, could hear all the loudness all the way 
from the living room of the Endou Household. 

&quot;Minako!&quot; He yelled, eyes peering upwards from his paper, &quot;Would you 
keep it down up there?! Anyone would think you didn&#39;t have a school to 
attend!&quot;

The young woman rushed quickly through the hallway, ignoring that 
comment for now, then ran straight into the kitchen. And she rustled up 
the first thing she could find that was edible. Some leftover gyuu-don 
from last afternoon&#39;s lunch. The feisty girl smiled at the small bowl 
left of it in the fridge. Which she soon pulled out, popped into the 
microwave across the counter, and set the time for three minutes. While 
it got ready, Minako walked out of her kitchen and into her living room 
to meet with her Dad. It also had her backpack in there, but that was 
just a minor detail. 

Hiroyuki slapped his paper shut and looked up at his nubile daughter as 
she clasped her book bag in one hand whilst waiting for her gyuu-don to 
re-heat. &quot;You&#39;re going to end up with an upset stomach if you keep 
eating breakfast when running to school. Minako Endou, you should know 
better.&quot;

&quot;Stop nagging at me, Dad,&quot; Minako replied, &quot;What&#39;d you expect me to do?&quot;

&quot;Wake up earlier? Eat properly? Get to school on time? Achieve good 
grades? Stop making so much noise while I&#39;m trying to read a newspaper 
which may contain an add for a better job than the monotonous crap I&#39;m 
currently working at to support you as your sole male parent which by 
the way is a stressing, difficult and taxing twenty-four-hour commitment 
when your daughter happens to be one of the-&quot;

&quot;I GET IT, DAD!&quot; Minako yelled, slinging her bag over her shoulder, &quot;Now 
stop fussing like an old maid and get back to your newspaper. I&#39;ll be 
gone as soon as my food is ready.&quot;

And (bing!) went the timer on the microwave. Three minutes was pretty 
much up. The girl nodded to her Dad once more then ran straight out of 
the living room, into the hallway and back into her kitchen. Minako went 
into one of the drawers at the side counter and pulled out a set of 
chopsticks. Then opened the microwave door and pulled out the small bowl 
of gyuu-don. Now hot and steaming from the three minute wait. Minako 
chortled deviously at her delicious looking meal and snagged a quick 
layer of beef into her mouth. As she chewed she walked out into the 
hallway again and gave a muffled &#39;Seeya Dad!&#39; to Hiroyuki. Two seconds 
later she was gone. The door slammed shut and the patriarch of the Endou 
Family sighed. 

&quot;Will that blasted girl ever listen to me?&quot;

But Minako was far too focused on eating and getting to school on time 
to have actually listened to her Father. And who could blame her? At 
that age, no one ever really gives a damn about what their parents have 
to say. And considering the fact that Minako was... quite unusual... she 
had more right to do so than anyone else. The girl strode down the quiet 
street of her road and began the short march to her school, Soryuusuke 
Gakuen. She really didn&#39;t care much for schoolwork. Minako herself was 
more interested in food and rock music. But she had been given detention 
so many times for coming to school late that she couldn&#39;t allow it to 
happen again. 

And so the Endou girl made her way through the quiet streets, munching 
on her gyuu-don, ignoring everything and anything that could possibly 
make her late. Until she heard a certain something that just made her 
freeze in position. As she turned a corner she came into the area of a 
park. A lovely little park called Ueda. The staging ground for a lot of 
happy days and... not so happy events. Minako chewed on her food a 
little slower as she saw four people standing across from her at the 
entrance to Ueda Park. Three of them were male. All rough, tall, 
school-uniformed boys. And from those uniforms, Minako could tell they 
all attended Soryuusuke Gakuen. The forth figure was female. Name? 
Minako could place it. But what she could place was that the girl was 
completely hot. Which, obviously, was the reason those four guys were 
all clamouring around her. But the girl didn&#39;t seem too pleased with all 
that testosterone-ridden attention she was getting. 

&quot;Hey...&quot; One of the tall thugs said smoothly, &quot;...Your name&#39;s Yuki 
Inoue, right? You&#39;re that new kid that&#39;s starting in school today! I 
know I&#39;m right, right? Right? RIGHT?!&quot;

Yuki nodded quickly and nervously, pulling a strand of her snow white 
hair from her face and tucked it behind her ear. &quot;...Um... that is the 
case, sir. But if I don&#39;t hurry I&#39;m going to be late on my first day...&quot;

&quot;Hey come on,&quot; Another of the burly male youth piped up, &quot;Forget about 
school! That&#39;s for nerds and geeks and ugly people! Why not cruise 
around with us for the day? I&#39;m damn sure that we could show you a good 
time...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a tempting offer... but I think I&#39;ll decline...&quot; Yuki responded. 

The third of the punks then scowled at her. &quot;What makes you think that 
you have a choice in the matter, little girl?&quot;

Then that particular male grabbed Yuki by the collar, giving her a 
lecherous smile with all the pent up lust a sexually repressed teen 
could wish for (or be cursed with). Yuki froze up and blinked as the yob 
knelt over her, until the un-ordinary Minako stepped into the fray.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Minako yelled out to the lot of them, still eagerly snacking on 
her bowl of hot gyuu-don, &quot;Don&#39;t you realize how clich&eacute; it is for a gang 
of boys to be hassling a young girl for a date? And don&#39;t you realize 
how clich&eacute; it&#39;ll make this scene look when I save her by kicking all 
your asses?&quot;

The first of the bunch sneered at her. &quot;Don&#39;t blame us! Blame that 
blasted untalented author who came up with this idea! Anyways, what we 
do with our property is our business! This girl is ours now! She belongs 
to the Hitou Koku Mi Gang!&quot; 

As ridiculous as &#39;One Aviation Fruit&#39; is for the name of a powerful 
school gang, Minako expressed a little bit of concern. Just a little 
bit. &quot;Hitou Koku Mi? You must be members of that pack that runs around 
the heels of Kazuya Futaba, right?&quot;

&quot;You know the boss?&quot; The second of the thugs looked over Minako&#39;s 
uniform, &quot;You must go to Soryuusuke Gakuen too then?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;You betcha.&quot;

The third one, who still had his hand gripping Yuki by the collar, 
looked over at the female student of their school. &quot;Well that doesn&#39;t 
matter at all. This girl is coming with us. We are going to have our way 
with her over and over again. We&#39;re gonna make any serious Hentai fan 
proud, understand me?&quot;

The Endou girl lowered her bowl a little. &quot;...Uh... yeah... I get the 
picture. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be going through with it. After all. 
Who&#39;d wanna get freaky with a broken jaw?&quot;

Thugs #1 and #2 pulled away from Yuki and Thug #3, walking up to Minako 
and cracking their thick knuckles with rhythmic intimidation. &quot;You&#39;ve 
got a big mouth, little girl. I don&#39;t know who you think you are... but 
we don&#39;t take kindly to people who threaten us. Those people are more 
than likely to get themselves hurt, catch my drift?&quot;&quot;

Minako snacked on another slice of beef from her bowl, speaking between 
bites. &quot;(munch, munch) ...Do you really... (munch, munch)  think that 
I&#39;m (munch, munch) scared of (munch, munch)  a gang called (munch, 
munch) One Aviation Fruit (munch, munch)...?&quot;

Thug #2&#39;s anger grew sharply. &quot;Are you making fun of the name of our 
feared and fearless gang? That name is a testament to our boss&#39;s great 
genius! We&#39;re gonna make you suffer for messing with our gang&#39;s girls 
and our gang&#39;s name!&quot; 

And that guy didn&#39;t waste any time in putting that declaration to the 
light of day. He growled menacingly and lunged straight at Minako, not 
caring that she was almost half his height. Now, at the beginning of 
this chapter I mentioned that Minako Endou was no ordinary girl. And 
know you&#39;re about to see why. As that meaty fist came swinging by her, 
Minako swiftly sidestepped the blow with the grace of an eagle. Still 
nibbling on her gyuu-don. Thug #2 skidded past her with the miss, 
completely confused. But his buddies weren&#39;t so confused as Minako made 
her second move. The girl smiled to herself and viciously shot a violent 
kick straight into the back of Thug #2. The young punk screamed in agony 
with Minako&#39;s sneaker snapping into his spine. And his huge, over-sized 
torso was sent sailing. Thug #2 was thrown into the air and came to a 
stop only when his head banged into the red-painted metal of a post box. 
He passed out in that second, and Minako retracted her leg, leaving 
shocked looks on the faces of Thugs #1 and #3, as well as the seemingly 
timid Yuki. 

You see, Minako Endou was blessed with the powers of superhuman agility 
and strength. 

Thug #1 shook visibly. &quot;...Who are you...?&quot;

&quot;The name&#39;s Minako Endou,&quot; The girl put forth, &quot;And you? Well... you&#39;re 
toast...&quot;
