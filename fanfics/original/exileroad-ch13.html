<a href="../original/exileroad-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The Queen&#39;s Council

The council room was lit by torches, the great table
laden by dishes for their lunch. Papers were scattered
between plates, copies of diplomatic matters,
treaties, messages and other matters. Personal guards
lined the walls, reliable men chosen for their honor
and trustworthiness as well as an ability to keep
their mouths shut.

&quot;She&#39;s WHAT?&quot; Queen Gwen blurted, looking at Commander
Hudson in surprise as she set the piece of beef she
was chewing on down. The slim blonde wasn&#39;t exactly
beautiful, her face was too strong for that, but she
was clearly striking.

The grizzled old soldier smiled grimly, Hudson dressed
in his uniform with his steel gray hair clipped short
as usual. &quot;Jantha&#39;s new bodyguard Midori is the
princess of Edo,&quot; he explained, &quot;who disappeared after
her father was overthrown.&quot;

&quot;So what in the nine hells is she doing here as a
hiresword?&quot; Richard blinked, the white haired viceroy
sitting across the table from Hudson. His clothes were
fine, the best silks and lace but his manner was
casual as he ate hungrily.

&quot;The Shogun put an order of death on the old royals,&quot;
Hudson said, &quot;though in truth Midori had left years
before in a dispute with her honored father. According
to the bards they never got along and it was quite a
scandal at the time.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Gwen frowned, looking thoughtful. &quot;Does the
Shogun know she&#39;s here?&quot; she asked, ripping into a
loaf of bread to mop up the juices from her meat.

&quot;Sasoke knows,&quot; Hudson named the ambassador to Edo,
&quot;but according to our spy in his residence he hasn&#39;t
sent word.&quot;

&quot;We thought he was in disfavor with the Shogun due to
his loyalty to the old king,&quot; Richard mused, &quot;I
suppose this proves it.&quot; He ripped a chicken leg off
the bird and chewed happily, a bit of grease dripping
down his chin.

&quot;Too bad the knowledge is no earthly use to us,&quot; Gwen
noted glumly.

&quot;Well, yes and no,&quot; Hudson mused. &quot;We can&#39;t use Midori
politically, the Shogun would try to eliminate her as
soon as he knew that she was alive,&quot; he smiled
faintly, &quot;but militarily she&#39;d certainly be an asset
to us.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Richard looked curious.

&quot;You see, the reason Midori feuded with her father was
over her military ambitions,&quot; Hudson explained, &quot;if I
understood the translations properly she&#39;d have been
considered a general here.&quot; A grin, &quot;An&#39; she was damn
good at her job.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope that isn&#39;t necessary,&quot; Gwen reminded both
men. She grasped her goblet of wine and drank, &quot;What
do you think of the latest proposal?&quot;

&quot;From the Guild of Gentlewomen?&quot; Richard quirked an
eyebrow. He smiled slightly, &quot;They could be useful to
us.&quot;

Hudson frowned, &quot;I can&#39;t say I&#39;m impressed that they&#39;d
make their support conditional on gaining official
status.&quot;

Richard smiled with amusement as he pointed out, &quot;It&#39;s
not like they have many options or leverage,
Commander.&quot;

Gwen nodded with a sudden grin, &quot;An&#39; I&#39;d have to
confess to being a supporter of theirs, too, though
they don&#39;t know it yet.&quot;

&quot;M&#39;lady!&quot; Hudson scolded.

Gwen laughed, &quot;You know as well as I do that I&#39;ve
pushed for many of the rights that the Gentlewomen
want, I just tend to be more subtle than that.&quot; She
sighed, &quot;The problem is, I can&#39;t publicly admit to
such support, not without driving the conservative
lords away.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s still some grumbling from the conservatives
to remove you,&quot; Richard offered up that fact, &quot;and
they have some pretty impressive private armies.&quot;

&quot;The city guard and the Queen&#39;s Own are ready to
defend you,&quot; Hudson said firmly.

&quot;I notice you didn&#39;t say anything about the army at
large,&quot; Gwen said wryly.

&quot;They&#39;re torn, m&#39;lady,&quot; Hudson admitted, &quot;most are
drawn from the districts of various lords an&#39; many are
loyal to them, first, then to the crown. While many
lords have pledged to you publicly others have not,
and that makes the fighting men nervous.&quot;

&quot;And without a loyal army I can&#39;t make the lords
acknowledge me by force,&quot; Gwen sighed. She drank
again, &quot;And how&#39;s the diplomatic situation?&quot;

&quot;Improving, actually,&quot; Richard said with a smile.
&quot;Jantha and your high level diplomats have managed to
secure non-aggression pacts or full treaties with the
majority of our neighbors,&quot; he reported, reaching
across the plates to heft several scrolls.

&quot;But?&quot; Hudson asked, feeling certain there was more.

&quot;The King of Xiang to the east has rebuffed our
diplomats and his army is recruiting,&quot; Richard
admitted, &quot;I suspect he had unfriendly intentions.&quot;

&quot;And he lies between us and the far border of Edo,
too,&quot; Gwen mused, mentally envisioning a map. Her
kingdom bordered on the sea on one side, smaller
kingdoms to the north and south. To the east was
Xiang, a mountainous region that was difficult to pass
to those who didn&#39;t know the land well, then beyond
that the great kingdom of Edo that stretched across
much of the continent.

&quot;Why would he dare pursue a military attack on us,&quot;
Hudson frowned, &quot;with Edo waiting to snatch him up?&quot;

Richard frowned, &quot;It&#39;s difficult to know the mind of
such a man, but I suspect he hopes that taking us will
make him enough of a power for Edo to negotiate with.&quot;

&quot;If he thinks that he&#39;s dreaming,&quot; Gwen shook her
head, &quot;only the loose alliance of the kingdoms of the
west has kept Edo from taking us before now.&quot;

Hudson smiled grimly, &quot;And if Xiang falls we&#39;ll be the
next one to go.&quot;

&quot;Do you think the others will stand beside us if Edo
does decide it&#39;s time to move?&quot; Gwen asked Richard
softly.

&quot;They know if we are taken they&#39;re doomed, too,&quot;
Richard said. He smiled slightly, &quot;I suspect we can
use this threat to start bringing the nobles in line,
m&#39;lady.&quot;

Hudson snorted, &quot;The fools will fall in line if only
for their own safety.&quot;

Gwen changed the topic, &quot;Have we found who sent the
Genin after Jantha?&quot;

&quot;Lord Darthan,&quot; Hudson said simply.

There was a moment of dead silence as both nobles
heard that. &quot;Didn&#39;t he just have a deadly accident?&quot;
Richard blinked.

Gwen smiled faintly, &quot;One of your special agents, I
take it?&quot;

Hudson nodded firmly, &quot;I apologize for not informing
you earlier, but I thought you wouldn&#39;t want to know
officially yet.&quot;

&quot;Why not just bring him to trial?&quot; Richard demanded.

&quot;Richard, think about it,&quot; Gwen said softly. &quot;He&#39;s was
a leader of the conservatives and my greatest enemy,
if I tried him it would automatically look bad no
matter how fair I am.&quot;

&quot;And a political assassination is better?&quot; Richard
scowled.

&quot;Yes, especially with these,&quot; Hudson took a set of
scrolls and passed them to Richard, &quot;Here are the
sworn statements of his vassals regarding what he did.
You can hold them over his cohorts, especially if they
continue to be stubborn supporting the Queen.&quot;

Richard hefted the papers as he looked at Hudson with
reluctant admiration, &quot;You can be a real bastard at
times.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Hudson smiled.

&quot;So with him dead will the Genin attacks stop?&quot; Gwen
asked.

&quot;Sadly, no,&quot; Hudson made a face,. &quot;the Genin feel
honor bound to complete a contract to the best of
their ability.&quot;

&quot;So they&#39;ll keep going until...?&quot; Richard trailed off.

&quot;Until they feel certain they&#39;ve fulfilled the debt to
their employer,&quot; Hudson sighed. A grim look,
&quot;Apparently Darthan wanted Jantha dead so that once he
eliminated Gwen there would be no successors
available.&quot;

&quot;Bastard,&quot; Gwen growled.</pre>
