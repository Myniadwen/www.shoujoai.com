<a href="../original/descent-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Grace blocked the punch, the black haired woman in the
formal business wear moving with surprising speed. She
yanked the police officer forward then twisted the arm
behind the man&#39;s back. &quot;All you had to do was play
ball,&quot; she murmured into the blonde haired man&#39;s ear,
&quot;look the other way when we asked.&quot;

&quot;Go to hell,&quot; he gasped, struggling weakly.

&quot;You first,&quot; and with that Grace grabbed him with her
other hand by the chin and in a violent motion broke
his neck with a sickening crack. &quot;They always have to
do it the hard way,&quot; she shook her head regretfully.
Dialing her cellphone she waited until it was picked
up then said, &quot;I need a cleaning crew sent out to the
docks.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Lina said, &quot;I&#39;ll send one out immediately.&quot;
She paused before adding, &quot;There may be some good news
on the Descent front.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Grace asked as she cleaned off her hands.


&quot;It seems the kamikaze gambit may have worked,&quot; Lina
reported calmly, &quot;the two targets were at ground zero
when the blast went off.&quot;

&quot;Bodies?&quot; Grace asked promptly.

&quot;None yet,&quot; Lina reluctantly conceded that point,
&quot;they may have been given assistance in leaving the
scene. The weapon was laced with the holy essences we
were recommended, it should be quite lethal to a
demon.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t report any of this to the Lady until we have
the bodies,&quot; Grace said to Lina finally, &quot;I have no
wish to give her good news that would be proven wrong
later on.&quot; A pause and she added wryly, &quot;That tends to
annoy her.&quot;

A much more subdued Lina signed off with, &quot;Of course,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

Grace hit the off button, then turned the phone back
on and dialed quickly, &quot;Aileen?&quot; A smile, &quot;We used the
ingredients that you suggested and the bomb may have
been successful. However, your personal touch might be
required to finish it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to that,&quot; Aileen answered, the
smile evident in the redhead&#39;s voice.

Grace smiled back at the former Templar&#39;s eagerness
and replied, &quot;I&#39;ll contact you when we know more.&quot;
Signing off once again Grace left the building,
nodding a greeting as a vehicle pulled up, several men
and women climbing out to walk over to her.

&quot;How do you want this handled, ma&#39;am?&quot; the leader
asked, her long silvery white hair flowing down her
back.

&quot;I want the body found later as a warning to any other
officers who don&#39;t cooperate,&quot; Grace answered her,
&quot;clean of fingerprints and all other traces, of
course.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll get right to it,&quot; and they filed by her into
the little room.

Grace&#39;s mind was already on other things as she
climbed into her car, starting the engine and driving
away. &#39;Where could that demon bitch have ran too?&#39; she
wondered.

&quot;How is she?&quot; Alex Conner called from the front seat
of the squad car.

&quot;Her bleeding is getting worse,&quot; Sister Samantha
Teresa, also known as Sam, answered the woman grimly,
her black priest&#39;s coat off and being used to try to
slow the blood that was gushing from Descent&#39;s
shoulder wound.

The demoness who was laying on the back seat was a
mess, frankly. Descent had used her body to shield Sam
from a series of explosive devices, taking the brunt
of both the blast and flying shrapnel. Her reddish
skin was now a pale pink, the dark blood staining the
seat beneath her.

&quot;Considering the hit she took,&quot; Alex answered, her red
hair falling into her eyes as they raced along just
under the speed limit, &quot;it&#39;s understandable.&quot; She was
tempted to use the lights and siren, but that would
draw too much attention to them.

&quot;No she heals almost instantly, usually,&quot; Sam answered
Alex grimly, &quot;there&#39;s got to be something else
involved.&quot;

&quot;Which doesn&#39;t leave us a lot of choice,&quot; Alex said
seriously.

Sam made a face, her brown hair falling into her eyes.
&quot;No, I guess not,&quot; she answered, &quot;get us to Jess Drake
as fast as you can.&quot;

A few moments later they pulled up in front of the
little tattoo parlor, one that was situated just
beyond what was considered to be the Lady Diana&#39;s
territory. It existed in an odd demilitarized zone, an
area where no gang or major organization would dare to
intrude. Why this was, few police or residents knew,
only those in touch with the real powers in the city
understood that it was due to the manager of this
place that the area was free.

Sam picked up Decent with a grunt, rushing by the
large windows that were hung with girlie art. Gorgeous
women bent and twisted there seductively, at least
until you looked into their dark eyes. Then you began
to realize that these were dangerous women pictured
there, not toys for one&#146;s amusement. The front room
served only a certain kind of customer, and even fewer
knew about the room in the back, and what might be
going on in there.

&quot;Jess,&quot; Alex yelled as they burst in through the front
door, the bell hanging above it loudly ringing out
into the shop.

Almost as soon as she was called Jess Drake came out
of the back room of the tattoo parlor, the slim black
haired young woman&#39;s eyes narrowing I concern. &quot;What
the hell&#39;s going on?&quot; she blinked, taking in the three
figures.

&quot;Drake,&quot; the look on Sam&#39;s face clearly said she did
not want to be there as she continued, &quot;we need your
help.&quot;

Jess was all business as she quickly took in Descent&#39;s
still form, then she said &quot;Get her into the back room,
now.&quot;

The four of them rushed past the curtain into the
darkened back room. the scent of incense and ink,
blood and certain fragrant oils hanging in the air.
With surprising gentleness Sam laid Descent on the
cloth covered table even as she looked over at Jess,
&quot;Please, save her.&quot;

&quot;Do my best,&quot; Jess answered dryly as she bent over
her, unmindful of the blood staining her clothes,
&quot;what happened?&quot; Sam quietly sketched in the details,
starting with her and Descent&#39;s war with Lady Diana
and ending with the explosion.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Alex managed softly.

Jess was scowling, &quot;A simple explosion wouldn&#39;t do
this damage....&quot; She held her hands over Descent&#39;s
still form and chanted, power rising up around the,
The demoness&#39; body seemed to fade, conduits of power
flowing through her form only to break off at certain
points.

&quot;Poison?&quot; Sam realized.

&quot;Blessed silver fragments, probably,&quot; Jess answered
grimly, &quot;I&#39;ll have to pull them out.&quot; Just then the
door bell rang out and Jess cursed softly, &quot;I&#39;ll be
right back.&quot;

Sam held a piece of damp cloth to Descent&#39;s shoulder
wound, watching it darken with blood as seconds
swiftly ticked by. Her patience waning as she heard
conversation in the background Sam called, &quot;Get back
here, Drake! We don&#39;t have much time.&quot;

A few moments later a pale Jess came back as she
grimly said, &quot;Your timing sucks, Sam.&quot;

&quot;The wounds aren&#39;t closing,&quot; Sam said tersely, &quot;but
the flow of blood is slowing a bit.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s bleeding out,&quot; Jess realized grimly. She looked
at Alex and Sam, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be able to do this
neat, so you&#39;re going to have to hold her down, hard.&quot;

&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; Alex asked as she grabbed
at Descent&#39;s legs, Sam reluctantly taking hold of her
upper body.

&quot;Get all the contamination out in one go,&quot; Jess said
coldly. The words that she spoke grated on the ears,
teasing the brain with fear as she gestured, red light
dancing around her hands, then she grabbed at mid
air.....

....and Descent jerked wildly as her flesh tore.
Shining fragments burst from all over her body,
splattering the other women with blood as they swept
over to where Jess stood. It took only seconds then
Jess dropped the wet mass of glittering fragments into
nearby basin with a thump, looking at Descent&#39;s bloody
form intently.

Free of contamination the wounds began to close, but
so slowly, her body remarkably pale. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
Sam asked.

&quot;She&#39;s lost a lot of blood,&quot; Jess answered grimly,
&quot;and she&#39;s not strong enough to replenish it all on
her own.&quot; She looked up at the two women, &quot;It&#39;s going
to have to be at least partially restored by an
outside source.&quot;

Sam looked down at Descent a moment, then up at Jess,
&quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Give me your arm,&quot; Jess gently cut into the flesh
then pressed the blood into Descent&#39;s chest as she
murmured something.

&quot;God!&quot; Sam staggered, feeling suddenly weak as blood
pumped from her body into Descent&#39;s, Alex steadying
her. Jess counted softly a few seconds then with
another word pulled Sam free, briskly tying up the
wound with a piece of bandage.

&quot;You all right?&quot; Alex asked.

&quot;Just dizzy for a moment,&quot; Sam waved off the officer&#39;s
concern. She looked at Decent was relieved to see her
color coming back. &quot;Is she going to be all right?&quot; she
asked Jess.

Jess wiped her hands, looking almost as tired as Sam
felt. &quot;It&#39;ll be a few days before she regains her
strength,&quot; she said frankly, &quot;but yes, she&#39;ll be
fine.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sam murmured before smiling a bit wryly,
&quot;I guess this puts us even for that whole skin-walker
mess.&quot;

&quot;I guess it does,&quot; Jess agreed. She looked over at
Alex, &quot;Though I&#39;d say the two of you owe this officer
for going above and beyond the call of duty.&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t need to....&quot; Alex started to protest.

Sam reached out to silence her, &quot;Thank you. I suspect
she would have died before I could have gotten Descent
to help.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: Alex and Sam first dealt with Jess Drake in
chapters four to six of &#39;Blood, sex and Magic&#39; also on
fictionpress and For those who don&#39;t read that series
Jess is an occultist and tattoo artist who chooses to
use her gifts to make up for the unsavory things she
had done in her past.
