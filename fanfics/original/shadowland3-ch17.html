<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>Alyson stumbled down the dorm stairs as she hastily searched for 
Natalie. If she knew the girl well enough she would be outside, 
somewhere near the Western Woods, lying under the shade of a tree. She 
hoped that her friend had not decided to change her habits all of a 
sudden because she was not sure how long she could last with that crutch 
under her arm. Resisting the urge to toss the crutch to the bottom of 
the stairs Alyson hopped the last few steps to the bottom, recalling her 
conversation with Natalie in that very stairwell earlier that day and 
shook the memory from her mind as she pushed through the doors to the 
lobby. She took a quick glance around to be sure that Natalie was not 
among the several kids that were standing around the room. Several of 
the girls were arguing about something, but Alyson paid no attention to 
them as she headed out of the building and into the fields that 
surrounded the Academy grounds. The moment she got a foot outside of the 
dorm she realized something was very wrong, her eyes gazed to the skies 
and the dark clouds that bordered the school grounds. 

&quot;This is not good.&quot; She breathed, her eyes not being able to tear away 
from the foreboding sky. Forcing herself to turn away from the sky she 
glanced around the grounds as she tried to figure out what she should do 
next. Unsure where Natalie was she decided that maybe going to talk with 
Amy first might be for the best. With her mind made up she turned around 
and started down the long path behind the back of the school and passed 
the Head Mistress&#39;s house. 

She stopped for a moment outside of the wide fenced yard that spread out 
before the small house the was the home to Sophia and Melissa, the Head 
Mistresses of Whispering Hills. She always got a strange feeling when 
around the two women and knew that they were not normal humans. They 
held a power to them like nothing she had ever experienced before, it 
was not a power that made her frightened, in fact they felt more 
welcoming then anything else. She could only feel a faint presence of 
one of the women coming from the building at that time and figured that 
they were more then likely out helping the many students around the 
school. That wave of energy that emitted from Kimberly&#39;s death must have 
affected quite a few of the kids around the school and they more then 
likely had their hands full around the school. She was about to turn 
away from the house when she saw something moving in one of the second 
floor windows. She was not sure what it was, but she was almost certain 
she saw a small stuffed toy of a white rabbit in the window. Her mind 
turned to the Bug Bear that was in Penny&#39;s room and worry filled her. 
She could not just leave the place not knowing if another of those 
tattered patchwork teddy bears still roamed the school. Without a second 
thought she pushed through the small wooden fence and passed between two 
large rosebushes that bordered a long stone path to the front door. 

Cautiously she crept up to the small porch and peered into the large 
front picture window. Inside the house was dark and she could not see 
anyone around. She was about to turn back to the front door when 
something moved in the shadows. She cupped her hand around her eyes and 
squinted to get a better look. She saw it again, another stuffed rabbit, 
this time yellow, was walking across the living room floor with what 
appeared to be a throw pillow carried over its head. The creature turned 
and Alyson swiftly stepped to the side so the creature could not see 
her. Holding her crutch tightly she wished she had grabbed her sword on 
the way out for she was not able to handle these monsters without a 
weapon, but she needed to do something that was for certain. She glanced 
around the porch for something that would make a good weapon when she 
found an umbrella leaning against the wall next to the door, a large 
umbrella, the kind of a metal spike at the end. She quickly moved to the 
object and picked it up, testing it weight. It might not have been a 
sword but it would work in a pinch on these little critters. 

Carefully she approached the front door and peered through the long 
frosted glass windows that bordered it. Unable to see much of anything 
through the distorted glass she adjusted her hold on the umbrella and 
tested the door with her wounded arm. Her arm might have been useless, 
but her hand could still move and she managed to grip onto the doorknob 
and gave it a slight turn to find it unlocked. This fact left an 
unsettling feeling inside of her. She was not sure if the Head 
Mistresses locked the door when they left or not, but it made the 
possibility of someone else being in the house very high and that would 
mean that those creatures might have already found a meal to feast on. 
If that was true she would need to battle them inside the person&#39;s 
dreams first and she was not sure she was ready for that in her current 
condition. Taking a hold of the door handle tightly in her hand, being 
sure not to allow it to slip and make any sound, she decided that she 
needed to at least find out if someone was in trouble or not.

Convincing herself to check out the house and then seek more help she 
slowly opened the front door and prayed that it wouldn&#39;t squeak.  When 
the door was opened enough to allow her to enter she slipped inside and 
carefully closed it after her. The inside was gloomier then she 
remembered it. When she first came to the Academy she was introduced to 
the Head Mistresses in their home. They were not at all surprised by her 
arrival and in fact had been awaiting her, even had a platter of snacks 
waiting for her. Natalie had convinced her to come to the school. She 
found out that Natalie had been a part of the Eastern side of the 
Academy for a long time and she thought it would be the place for Alyson 
as well. Back then Alyson was sceptical, but her brother seemed very 
interested in the idea of her attending the school, and she discovered 
much later that his intensions were not all just. He would question her 
everyday after school was about, whom she made friends with, and what 
she was taught. He was extremely interested in the school&#39;s inner 
workings and she was his little spy. She didn&#39;t realize this until 
recently and felt guilty for relaying information to him. She rubbed at 
her head as emotions began to swell inside of her head and she forced 
herself to clear her mind and stay focused. 

She glanced around, keeping a sharp eye out for any sign of movement. 
When she was certain nothing was hiding in the shadows she began to move 
down the long hall, taking a quick look inside of the living room before 
moving further along. She discovered a kitchen to the left with a large 
dinning table at the far end under a long window. There were several 
pieces of paper attached to the refrigerator with magnets; recipes, and 
notes from one sister to the other, and a couple of photos. One of the 
photos caught Alyson&#39;s attention and she moved in to get a closer look. 
It was a photo of several young girls along with the Head Mistresses and 
Amy as well as three large men in the background. Although younger she 
recognized Kris right away, sitting next to her sister Kai, and next to 
her was the girl who was with Kai and helped capture Akaime, Gwen, that 
was the name she remembered being mentioned. The other girl&#39;s she 
suspected must have been the other Sister&#39;s of Death that Amy had 
mentioned earlier. She found the smallest of them, dressed in a small 
pink skirt and powder blue hoodie, and guessed that one must have been 
Carey and could not understand how such a sweet innocent looking child 
could commit murders. Actually she would not have thought any of the 
girls to be Angels of Death if she had not been told about it. One of 
the men in the background was what really attracted her attention. While 
the two others appeared normal, although very large in comparison to the 
rest of the girls and dressed in Victorian flair, it was first man, on 
the left that drew in Alyson&#39;s eyes. He stood off to the side of the 
group and was covered entirely in black with dark brown hair falling 
into his mask-covered face, a mask that was two colours, silver on one 
side and white on the other with many red markings that resembled the 
tattoos on the Sister&#39;s of death. His gold and blue eyes stared out of 
the picture at Alyson, almost as if he could see her standing there in 
the kitchen. She was almost sure he could see her and this thought 
frightened her. Her eyes darted around the many other photos to find the 
man only in the one. What was his connection to the Head Mistress? Could 
he be their father? No she was almost sure he wasn&#39;t their father and as 
his eyes stared out at her she found herself backing away from the 
photo. 

Abruptly a sliding patio door in a small study to her right slide open 
with a bang and a girl in a long black cloak came crashing into the 
room, a child cradled in her arms, and collapsed to the ground.
