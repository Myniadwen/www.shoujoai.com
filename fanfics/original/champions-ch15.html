<a href="../original/champions-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>I am the one who takes care of them all

I drew them in from their own damning fall

I am more than I seem, yet never revealing

I simply seek out the lost to use all my healing

But every coin has two sides, every smile has its frown

And mine is a fate that will bring this world down

For though I walk now in shimmering white

And though I smile now in hospitable light

A deeper side still is there to be found

It is for alternative purposes that I am bound

I seek the lost, yea, but that is the start

While the world may be dying, I continue my part

And I am not lost, I am totally whole

And yet fittingly, so far from my goal

So patience, I ask you, while I continue my trek

Hold fast, all my friends, and beware of your neck

I go to destroy, I go to save all

I go to bring them in from their own damning fall

The Dead Zodiac

Naked and in the sexual embrace of his lover, Yan couldn&#39;t imagine any 
better way to spend his afternoon. Garnet was, as men usually were, both 
shy and fantastic in bed, and attended to Yan as they laughed, kissed, 
rubbed each other&#39;s chests, teased their genitalia, and made sweet love 
for hours on end. In fact, the pleasure could&#39;ve gone on all night long, 
but Yan had his phone go off&#151;and at the worst time, too! He and Garnet 
were trapped in a lover&#39;s embrace and didn&#39;t want to break for anything. 
Finally, Garnet dismounted and hissed in his lover&#39;s ear.

&quot;Your phone&#39;s ringing.&quot;

&quot;Screw it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather screw you.&quot; Yan laughed and giggled as Garnet pinned him 
down. He stretched his arms out, exposing his manly chest in full glory 
to Garnet&#39;s lusty hands, as he reached for the phone by his bed. He 
picked it up, recognized the number, and purred into it.

&quot;What up, bitch?&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Yan. I&#39;ve just been informed of a meeting.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, sure thing, hon. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s why you called me. Maybe I was 
just on your mind and you couldn&#39;t get me out.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, that&#39;s disgusting!&quot;

&quot;You know you want some of me, bitch,&quot; he sang. &quot;You may think you&#39;re a 
lesbo but I know you want my ass.&quot;

&quot;The only place I want your ass is in a grinder! Now get over here!&quot;

&quot;What, so you can fool around with me? Sorry, bitch, I don&#39;t do women. 
You&#39;ll just have to find yourself another man-slut.&quot;

&quot;Screw you, Yan! I wouldn&#39;t touch you even to strangle you! Just come on 
over and lose your whore.&quot;

&quot;Mm, feeling horny, are we?&quot; The girl on the other end grunted in 
exasperation and hung up rudely. Yan laughed, threw the phone away, and 
grinned at Garnet. &quot;Mm, we&#39;ve been a very patient boy today, haven&#39;t we? 
Very good, too. Good boys get rewarded.&quot; Garnet grinned and accepted 
Yan&#39;s embrace; they pounced and rolled around on the bed until the phone 
rang again. Yan sighed wearily, promising to &quot;put that bitch in her 
place&quot;, and picked up the phone again. Garnet traced his finger along 
his lover&#39;s lower back, edging nearer to its bottom.

&quot;Miss me already, bitch?&quot; sang Yan. The voice on the other end, however, 
was not the girl&#39;s.

&quot;Yan, you malfunctioning pile of animal refuse, how dare you speak so 
insubordinately to me!!!&quot;

&quot;ACK! S-sir!!&quot; Yan bolted up, throwing his lover for a loop, and stood 
perfectly straight in spite of being several miles from his master&#39;s 
wrathful gaze.

&quot;You listen to me, you whorish swine! If you don&#39;t drag yourself here in 
the next ten minutes, I will gouge out your eyes, force you to eat them, 
and drag you here myself by your empty sockets! Do I make myself 
clear?!&quot;

&quot;Yessir, absolutely, sir! I&#39;ll be there!&quot;

&quot;You had better be.&quot; Slam. Yan stood catatonic as the dead phone hummed 
back at him. He barely even felt Garnet crawl up to him and purr.

&quot;Who was that, your other boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; he snapped, pushing his lover away. Yan immediately began 
dressing, disappointing Garnet to the point of actually being in a bad 
mood. &quot;Look,&quot; he said hastily as he dressed, &quot;I have to go now. I can&#39;t 
tell you why, I just have to go. It&#39;s none of your business, so don&#39;t 
ask. I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll be back, but hopefully it won&#39;t take long.&quot; 
He kissed Garnet quickly and said goodbye so fast that the poor young 
man barely even knew it. He groaned, cursed, and flopped back down on 
the empty bed, wondering what force in the world could&#39;ve made his 
boyfriend leave like that.

Wherever the Crimson Blades went, their reputation preceded them. Entire 
towns became abandoned at the mere mention of their name; shopkeepers 
were forced to stay behind and attend their needs, too afraid to run and 
too afraid to stay. The Crimson Blades were ruthless and powerful in all 
aspects, and none were more feared than their esteemed leader, the man 
bestowed with the very Crimson Blade itself, a sword rumored to have 
been forged by the blood of a god. They had settled camp outside a 
mountain pass one evening, on their way to enforce their laws in one 
disobedient section of the world, and were in the middle of discussing 
plans.

&quot;Hail, hail!&quot; cried riders on horseback. &quot;Hail, and heed my words, if 
you value your lives! Our great lord and master is coming through these 
areas! Hail, and prepare yourselves!&quot; The Crimson Blades were known for 
their fearlessness, but even they buckled in terror at the mere mention 
of their leader. Dozens of troops organized themselves as if the very 
world depended on it, and stood in greeting as the great Sashuo himself 
marched past their ranks, his green samurai armor standing out brightly. 
He entered one tent at random and growled.

&quot;Who is in charge here?&quot; A noble-looking, older man came and knelt 
before him.

&quot;My services are yours.&quot;

&quot;Report.&quot;

&quot;Milord, scouts have spotted a group of dissents a mile away from here 
bearing a white flag. They have asked your personal permission to greet 
them.&quot;

&quot;Make sure there is a pike for every head in their number.&quot;

&quot;It will be done, milord. Also, we have a report from headquarters.&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot;

&quot;Tent six, milord.&quot; Sashuo left without any hesitation and marched to 
tent six. There were men in there already waiting to greet him; one held 
the letter out, knowing his lord hated to wait. Sashuo silently opened 
the letter, read it, and handed it to its former bearer.

&quot;Burn it,&quot; he ordered, &quot;and the town. Leave ten survivors to spread the 
news: three men, three women, two children, two elderly. I will be going 
now.&quot;

&quot;There are horses waiting for you in tent five.&quot;

&quot;Good!&quot; Sashuo saddled up, armor and all, and looked down at the Crimson 
Blades surrounding him. He pointed to them all and gave them one last 
order: &quot;Above all else, do not forget to send me any word regarding the 
Takamatsu family. Until I get back, Lady Snowblood is in charge.&quot;

&quot;It shall be done, milord.&quot; Sashuo was off quickly, and in moments even 
the dust he had kicked up had settled.

......

Jason McReedy had a wife, two kids, a small group of sturdy men under 
his command, and a huge problem. Five from his unit had already been 
wiped out; three more came back with grievous injuries. Doctors didn&#39;t 
think their chances were good, and urged him to pull out and save what 
was left of his team. He would&#39;ve refused, but for one fact: there were 
fifteen men including himself there, and only one enemy. The doctors had 
a different viewpoint.

&quot;Sergeant, this one enemy has wiped out eight of your men, by itself! 
Why risk sending any more in?&quot;

&quot;I will not go home with my tail between my legs, doctor, and I will not 
retreat from one enemy! How could I show my face to my wife and children 
after such a shameful act?!&quot;

&quot;Better to be a living dog than a dead lion!&quot;

&quot;But I will not die, and neither will anybody else. Isn&#39;t that right, 
men?&quot; His troops cheered, but the doctor looked skeptical. He advised 
them once again to reconsider, but his words were useless&#151;Sergeant 
McReedy was already heading out with his men, weapons in every hand. 
Their lone enemy stood before them, not even a stone&#39;s throw away, and 
waited patiently for their attack. Ever since it had arrived to bar 
their way, it had never spoken or given any signs of surrender, even as 
five men surrounded it. The creature&#151;for it did not seem human&#151;had gold 
skin, fabulous jewels and clothes, and six arms, each one with a deadly 
weapon. It was hairless, speechless, and merciless; Jason refused to die 
without a glorious fight.

&quot;Whatever you are,&quot; he called to the monster, &quot;you will soon cease to 
be. There is nothing that my unit cannot overcome.&quot; The men cheered and 
charged the beast, all fifteen of them shining, screaming, whirling, and 
dying. The monster became a tornado of attacks, spinning its six weapons 
around so quickly that no defense could be made. Body parts fell, blood 
spurted out, heads rolled and intestines fell to the floor as every 
mother&#39;s son fell dead. In a matter of seconds, the creature had 
decimated all but one if its enemies&#151;all but the Sergeant. His heart 
raced as he stared at the monster who would inevitably kill him.

&quot;Your name,&quot; he demanded. The beast sliced him into nine pieces. Its 
earring gave off a soft buzz as it walked past the carnage.

&quot;Indira, return to base at once. I repeat, return to base at once.&quot; The 
creature called Indira put the call on hold, and continued to walk, ever 
so slowly and patiently, towards the medical clinic. The doctors saw him 
and screamed, scrambled, anything to get away. Indira murdered four of 
them and put every single recovering patient out of their misery before 
leaving.

......

When I was a child, I heard stories of the were-wolf, the creature who 
was a man by daylight and a wolf by the full moon. I was frightened of 
these stories at first, but when I got older, I outgrew them. I found a 
husband, got married, and raised three wonderful children, with whom I 
shared tales of the were-wolf. They too were frightened, but after every 
story, I assured them that there was no such thing, that it was all 
fancy&#151;perhaps a warning in disguise, or maybe some religious teaching. 
Whatever the origin, were-wolves simply did not exist, except in those 
stories, and stories, my children, cannot hurt you.

When I woke in the morning, the sky was gray with rain. The crops were 
singing happily and our flock of hens were out playing in the mud. I 
laughed and danced, and went to wake the children. I knocked and called 
for them, but they did not answer, so I opened the door carefully. 
Inside, there awaited me a mother&#39;s worst fear: my children were gone, 
and in their place was a trail of blood. I fainted and blacked out for 
hours. When I came to, my husband had terrible news: all of our children 
had been taken away, murdered, and stripped of their flesh. I screamed 
and screamed until I fainted again.

For a whole month, I was dead to the world. My only joy, the fruit of my 
loins, had been taken from me in the most horrible fashion 
imaginable&#151;how was I supposed to go on after that? I sat and knitted a 
scarf, trying to forget and distract myself, but it only made things 
worse. My husband tried comforting me, but I could hear his tears in the 
night. When the moon came out in the dark hours, I shuddered at the 
howling of wolves. Three days later, my husband was gone as well, 
leaving behind only a trail of blood. I wept, but vowed to face the 
monster that had destroyed my family.

I prepared for a whole month, training my body and spirit to face my 
attacker. I kept a knife under the pillow and the windows in my house 
barred shut. I slept with the lights on. I plowed deep ditches around 
the house and filled them with water so I could hear my family&#39;s 
murderer splish-splashing to finish our line off. I asked the local 
priest to bless my house, and to leave symbols over my front door and my 
bed to ward off anything unnatural. I prayed and fasted, and kept the 
holy days, and openly damned evil. But this was all in vain: my killer 
came when I least suspected it.

As I scurried to my house during one dark evening, I noticed an old 
friend of mine, Jane Brewe, hobbling along. Jane had finished collecting 
herbs for the autumn and was storing them in her home; she paused to 
smile at me. Knowing her and her family well, I invited her into my 
house for some tea. My nerves were shot, but her presence calmed me. She 
had been praying too, and collected herbs believed to ward away 
attackers. I thanked her for her help and let her inside my home. I then 
went in search of candles, and tinder for the fire, but when I came 
back...

The most horrifying moment in an adult&#39;s life is when they realize that 
all of those fairy-tale bedtime stories their parents had told them were 
really true. For me and my family, it was too late: the legend of the 
were-wolf was real, and right inside my home. I met my attacker and 
prayed that if I should die, I would curse the friend who betrayed 
me&#151;the were-wolf in sheep&#39;s clothes.

After that, Jane was never seen in the town again.

......

Darred was having a rough day, and having to walk in the smog and the 
smoke of the city certainly didn&#39;t make things any better. On top of the 
bad air, he also had to content with the never-ending noise, the thick 
crowds of people, the screaming cars, the demanding vendors, and the 
children, ugh! The children! He sneered at any who came close and 
threatened to strike them. Darred was not having a good day, and the 
last thing he needed was to get mugged. Which did happen, of course. A 
robber jumped out at him suddenly, waving a gun and shouting.

&quot;No funny business! Your money or your life!&quot; Darred rolled his eyes. He 
didn&#39;t need this nonsense. Not today. Not to him.

&quot;Bother. Go scare somebody else, mate. I&#39;m in no mood to deal with 
hoodlum foolishness.&quot;

&quot;I said gimme your money!&quot; Darred snorted&#151;really, he was having an awful 
day&#151;and glared straight at the man in spite of his gun. He locked eyes 
and spoke in a very calm, hypnotic tone.

&quot;But you don&#39;t want me money.&quot;

&quot;I...what?&quot;

&quot;You do not want me money,&quot; he said evenly. &quot;You should let me go. 
Pretend you never saw me, mate. Go and make something of your life. Get 
a job, an honest job, and leave me the hell alone.&quot;

&quot;Get...a job...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the way. Off ya go now. Oh, and you should put that gun of yours 
to some better use. Stick it to your head and pull the trigger next 
time.&quot;

&quot;Head...trigger...&quot; Darred snorted and shoved his way past the confused 
man. In a few moments, an explosion ripped apart the air of the city, 
causing people to scream in terror. A man had shot himself right in 
broad daylight, for no reason at all, and Darred found it oddly 
relieving. Maybe this day wasn&#39;t so bad after all. He ducked inside his 
hotel, trying to whistle, and greeted the receptionist, a man far more 
attractive than he.

&quot;Hello, sir. We received a message for you while you were away, um&#151;top 
priority, it was. Hmm. I didn&#39;t get the name of the sender, though...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have it now, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; The receptionist handed Darred a 
manila folder, and inside was a notice of extreme urgency. Darred 
chuckled&#151;well, this day was just getting better and better&#151;and crumpled 
the folder and letter up. &quot;Thanks, mate. I&#39;ll be checking out now.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes. Um, your bill.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not paying no bill.&quot; The receptionist blinked.

&quot;You&#39;re...not...paying...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, I&#39;m not paying. It&#39;s on the house, see?&quot;

&quot;On the house... Y-yes, sir, I understand...&quot;

&quot;Glad to see we have an agreement. Well, so long.&quot; Darred smiled and 
waved, leaving the hotel deeper in debt and his pocketbook unscathed. He 
hailed a cab, told them where to drive, and left without paying. He 
slipped into the building, and as far as the world was concerned, that 
was that.

......

As far as the eye could see, there were trees, and as far as the eye 
could see, there were loggers cutting down those trees. Chainsaws 
drowned out the cries of birds, and shouts of lumberjacks replaced them 
as little by little, the forest was cleared away to make room for 
civilization and advancement. In the racket and confusion, few of the 
older men noticed that among their ranks, a young child was wandering 
around, a sparrow on his shoulder and a rabbit hopping before him. This 
child slowly made his way to the foreman of the group, who was impatient 
and not too fond of children.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said, his voice mature for his age. &quot;Excuse me. Why are 
you logging in this forest?&quot;

&quot;Kid, I don&#39;t have time for questions, now get outta here before you get 
hurt.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; he said again, &quot;but this forest is not for logging.&quot;

&quot;Ha! Says who? Listen, we got a letter of permission from the Parks and 
Wildlife group saying it&#39;s okay for us to cut this place down. We&#39;re 
gonna build a lot of nice lakeside homes, and maybe you&#39;ll live in one.&quot;

&quot;I already have a home. This forest is not for logging.&quot;

&quot;Kid, I already told you, we have permission. Go wave your environmental 
flags somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Mother Nature does not like her children to be killed so your kind can 
thrive off her misery.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe this.&quot; The foreman picked up a sheet of paper and waved 
it right in front of the child. &quot;There, see? Written permission&#151;and this 
guy&#39;s an environmentalist, too! Can&#39;t argue with that. Look, we&#39;re not 
choppin&#39; down the whole friggin&#39; forest here, just enough to make way 
for new homes.&quot;

&quot;But these trees are homes to dozens of my friends. And they don&#39;t like 
their homes destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; The foreman hadn&#39;t noticed it before, but more and more birds had 
nested in the branches of the doomed trees. Wolves had come panting into 
the area, and had now surrounded it. Bees hovered around the kid&#39;s head. 
Several great birds of prey circled around, and a family of bears 
lumbered in, snorting and growling quietly. The foreman didn&#39;t take 
notice of this yet; he had a schedule to keep.

&quot;Leave now,&quot; said the child, &quot;and never come back.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Finally losing his patience, the foreman grabbed the kid by his 
shirt and pulled him close. &quot;Who do you think you are, huh? You&#39;re just 
some punk kid who got brainwashed by his hippie parents!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not a kid,&quot; he said eerily. &quot;I&#39;m Valmont, the Summoner, and it&#39;s 
time you gave back to this planet.&quot; The foreman barely had time to grunt 
in confusion before a loud noise, a screaming, silenced him. His men 
were running around helplessly as all the birds in the trees swooped 
down and attacked them. The wolves sprang and tore the stragglers apart; 
the bees smashed into people&#39;s faces, pocking them with stings and 
sores, and the bears stood quietly watching the foreman. They were on 
their hind legs.

&quot;You had your chance,&quot; said the kid coldly. &quot;Now, they will have theirs. 
Let us observe the conflict between man and nature.&quot; The foreman 
screamed and ran, but the bears could run faster, and in no time at all 
they had caught up with him. Valmont laughed as he heard his screams 
come to an end, and in moments, the only sound he could hear was the 
quiet buzzing of the bees. He sighed, extended his arm, and let one of 
the birds perch on it.

&quot;Silly men,&quot; he said idly. The bird twitched its head, dropping 
something small and white on the boy&#39;s arm. He plucked it up and noticed 
it was a letter from home. After reading it, he smiled and handed it 
back to the bird. He then whistled twice, and from out of the sky came 
an enormous bird, its wingspan like an airplane, its body covered with 
feathers of red, gold, green, blue, yellow&#151;the magnificent Roc, last of 
its kind, emperor of all avian creatures. It bore Valmont on its back 
and flew into the sky faster than human reckoning could believe.

......

&quot;This one&#39;s tough.&quot;

&quot;I know. We&#39;ve tried everything, and he still won&#39;t talk. What&#39;s this 
guy made out of, iron?&quot;

&quot;I know. Nothing short of mutilation will get him to say anything.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. ...Think we should ask her to do it?&quot;

&quot;You kidding? She&#39;ll kill him.&quot;

&quot;But she always gets the job done.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and she gets the guy done as well.&quot;

&quot;You got any other ideas?&quot; Sigh.

&quot;I personally wanna see this prick turn into jelly. Send her in. Tell 
her...she gets to do things her way.&quot;

&quot;And I thought she was a sick kid.&quot; They laughed, pressed a button, and 
spoke into the phone: &quot;Uh, Alia? Uh, hi. Listen, we...got a job for you. 
Room 509&#151;think you can handle it? Good. Over.&quot; They pushed the button 
again and gave each other a grim stare.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to be in his shoes.&quot;

&quot;Shoes? Hell, I wouldn&#39;t wanna be in the same room.&quot;

Their prisoner looked up as the door opened and closed. He had sat 
through their worst methods of interrogation and had come out laughing 
and spitting&#151;but certainly not singing. They had declared him 
unbreakable, he heard, and seemed stuck on how to get anything out. But 
he was like a coconut, and they were trying to crack him using 
toothpicks. He could stand worse, too&#151;that&#39;s why he was used by the 
agency. As the door closed, he laughed and barked, expecting more 
childish games. What he got was a killer.

Alia stood tall and gaunt before him, dressed in a white suit and white 
pants. She had on a black derby and carried a cane, either used to walk 
or strike people. She had a sadistic smile on her face, a black teardrop 
tattoo on her cheek, and hummed merrily as she walked up to the man. He 
whistled.

&quot;Hey, finally, a pretty face. I was wondering when I&#39;d get to see a 
lady. Huh, but if they think I&#39;ll talk, they got another thing comin&#39;. 
There ain&#39;t no woman good enough to get me singin&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; howled Alia giddily. &quot;And under what circumstances do you think 
you would finally break, O my brother bound in chains?&quot;

&quot;None, bitch!&quot;

&quot;That remains to be seen,&quot; she said merrily. Alia stepped closer, so 
close that her crotch was nearly in his face, and she ran her finger 
along his scalp, tracing his hair roughly. &quot;I&#39;ve a mind to prove you 
wrong, O my hairy foe, but it is not your information I seek. If you 
think I am here to glean words from your mouth, you are mistaken. I do 
not torture for information, I just do it because I like it. For fun, 
see? And we are going to have a delightful time.&quot;

&quot;...Whuh?&quot; Alia laughed out loud as the man gawked at her, and slashed 
his face with a scalpel she had kept hidden. A thin red scar formed on 
his forehead, and he screamed as a musical waltz boomed to life on the 
PA. Alia laughed and sang, making up words to the waltz as she slammed 
the butt of her cane in his belly, punched his ears until they bled, and 
made random cuts on his face and shoulders. She jammed the scalpel in 
his thigh, laughing and singing, and smashed his nose with her cane 
until it broke to pieces. His screams were easily drowned out by the 
booming song.

She stood and twirled around, dancing with the air as the waltz reached 
a climax. He screamed, but she was oblivious to him and everything 
else&#151;until she pulled out a cigarette lighter. She gave him a giddy 
smirk&#151;he yelled&#151;and she twirled over to his back, where his hands had 
been tied behind the chair. She lit the flame and held it directly 
underneath his naked palms, and kept it there, humming and howling. She 
chuckled at his screams, and drove the scalpel into his back, carving up 
huge gashes of flesh, ignorant and happy.

&quot;Screaming will only make it worse, brother!&quot; she called. She threw the 
scalpel away, skipped back to his front, knelt down, and removed his 
footwear. She giggled and tickled his naked toes, and to the man&#39;s 
horror, pulled out large wire cutters from her pocket. She squeezed them 
over his smallest toe and looked up at him. Then she wrenched her hands 
shut.

&quot;You can stay silent if you like,&quot; she said as he roared. &quot;Or you can 
talk, it doesn&#39;t matter to me. One way or another, all these piggies 
shall be mine.&quot; She put the cutters over his other toe and was about to 
squeeze shut, but was interrupted by a sudden break in the music. She 
bolted up quickly and glared at the one-way mirror, knowing her fellows 
were behind it in secret.

&quot;What is the meaning of this, O my friends? I cannot work without 
beautiful music! Turn it on or I shall cancel my services.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, Alia, but we have a message from a man who claims to be your 
boss. He said you should return home and await orders. That&#39;s...all we 
were told.&quot;

&quot;...Home?&quot; She smiled and raised an eyebrow. She turned to the bleeding 
man in the room and slapped him. &quot;Home again, home again, jiggedy-jig. 
It looks like you&#39;ve been spared. Next time, if we meet, I shall cut off 
your hands and use them as beverage coasters. Or maybe I will just slap 
you with them. Does that not sound divine?&quot; He spat at her; she jumped 
away, grinned, and kicked him. She span around, tipped her derby, and 
left whistling through the door she had came in from. The mess she left 
behind began weeping uncontrollably; he was scarred forever.

......

&quot;Longshot&quot; Larry had always been a womanizer, but it was his partner and 
brother-in-arms &quot;Deadeye&quot; Dan who got the girl&#151;and what a girl! 
Athletic, sumptuous, exotic, and sensual, Emily was everything that any 
man could want, all wrapped up in a nice, blue-skinned package. Longshot 
envied his partner, who seemed to draw women towards himself 
effortlessly. He hadn&#39;t gotten a single girlfriend in years, and it 
wasn&#39;t as if he was unattractive or untalented. Heck, he was one of the 
best snipers there were! So why&#39;d Deadeye always end up with some hot 
new chick? It didn&#39;t make any sense.

He kept his gun out as he walked far behind his partner and the girl. 
She clung onto him and squealed; he kept silent, kept vigil, and kept 
his guard up. Deadeye was a man whose aim was lethal; he and Longshot 
combined to make a powerful, albeit odd team. Emily was just a trophy; 
she&#39;d probably be long gone before tomorrow afternoon&#151;and knowing 
Deadeye, she wouldn&#39;t even hold a grudge. If Longshot so much as looked 
at a girl wrong, though...

Deadeye Dan suddenly gave a cry of pain as he jerked backwards and fell. 
Longshot shouted out to his partner and ran to help, but he was too 
late: an arrow the length of his arm was imbedded in Deadeye&#39;s chest. He 
screamed and pointed his sniper rifle in the direction the arrow came 
from, but he couldn&#39;t see a thing. Emily, on the other hand, didn&#39;t seem 
fazed at all. She put her finger in her mouth and smiled coyly.

&quot;Oh my, it seems I broke his heart. Oh well, that&#39;s what he gets for 
sleeping with my Naoma and Yubami.&quot; Longshot roared at her.

&quot;What? Hey, I know those names! Those were his ex-girlfriends! You 
saying you had him killed because of that?!&quot;

&quot;What, me, kill anybody?&quot; She whimpered defenselessly, but it was too 
late: Longshot had his gun and now, he had his target too. He blasted 
Emily right in her abdomen and left her for dead as he ran to find his 
best friend&#39;s killer. He climbed to the top of a building and set his 
scope to the longest range available, but still couldn&#39;t see anybody. 
The air whistled above him; he barely had time to react as another arrow 
whizzed by and plunked in the ground, merely a hair away from where he 
had been. Clenching his teeth, he rose and aimed right where the arrow 
had originated, and cursed as he still couldn&#39;t see anything. How could 
anybody shoot him from so far away?!

He jerked forward unexpectedly as he felt a blow come at him from 
behind. Turning around, he expected to find an attacker ready for the 
grave&#151;but nobody was there. Confused, he looked around, but he was the 
only one on the roof. Longshot buckled suddenly as a blow struck him in 
the knee, then his gut, then his chest. He fell to the floor and felt 
his torso being crushed by some unknown force. Longshot tried 
brandishing his rifle, but to his shock, it was pulled out from his arms 
and actually started floating in the air!

&quot;Who&#39;s there?!&quot; he shouted. He got his answer in the form of a laugh.

&quot;A phantom, handsome. Or maybe...I&#39;m just invisible.&quot;

&quot;No...I know that voice, but it can&#39;t be! I shot you! There&#39;s no way&#151;&quot;

&quot;Oh, is there?&quot; And to his surprise, Emily materialized out of thin air, 
totally unharmed and smiling. He gawked at her, and was so stunned that 
he couldn&#39;t even feel the arrow whizzing into his back, ending his life 
just like that. He fell dead, his story over, his brief legacy soon to 
be forgotten. Emily shrugged, tossed the masterless weapon away, and 
descended down to the surface. She turned on her earpiece and spoke to 
her partner, who was stationed a mile away in her own sniper&#39;s quarters.

&quot;We got him, Yubami. He never knew what hit him. Meet us at the usual 
spot. I&#39;m gonna go thank Naoma.&quot; Yubami didn&#39;t answer&#151;she didn&#39;t need 
to&#151;and Emily smiled in anticipation. On the surface, a plain-looking 
woman in colorful robes awaited her, hands crossed over her stomach in 
anticipation. Emily smiled and welcomed the patient girl into her arms, 
and licked her ear as she purred seductively: &quot;I owe you one, lover.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Emily grinned and stared right into the other girl&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Oh, but I want to repay you. My sweet little Naoma has saved my life 
once again; the least I can do is show her how grateful I am.&quot; Naoma 
smiled, then gasped, as Emily kissed her neck, pressing her lips gently 
on the woman&#39;s pulse. They managed to control themselves as the stoic 
third member of their group joined them, and together they headed off to 
a more private area to officially &quot;celebrate&quot; their revenge. After all, 
with that trio, it was always pleasure before business, and to Hell with 
their master if he got angry.

......

There was once a legend about a creature made from clay and stone, 
brought to life for some great purpose, but its immense strength and 
size caused it to become confused. It did not achieve its purpose and 
thus became a monster. There was a similar being walking through the 
remains of a city far on the other side of the world: as tall as a 
building, as strong as a wrecking ball, and as tough as the world 
itself, the mighty golem of legends had come to life and was now 
destroying everything in its path. The military had been called in to 
stop it, of course, but their weapons seemed ineffective on its granite 
hide. Even missiles only made dents, and these little holes could repair 
themselves whenever the golem touched the ground.

Though it was slow and mindless, the creature could level a building in 
just a few swipes, or tear a helicopter from the sky, and it could smash 
a tank simply by stepping on it. The ground shook underneath every 
step&#151;windows shattered, the streets were torn to pieces, metal and brick 
were turned to dust as it plowed through buildings brainlessly&#151;and aside 
from nuclear power, little could be used to halt the monster. Nobody 
noticed the ancient, wild-looking man dressed in a simple gray habit 
high up above, watching the creature demolish the city, and if they did, 
they&#39;d never think he was related to the monster. Yet with a single 
gesture, he stopped the beast, apparently satisfied that it had done its 
work.

&quot;That is enough for now, Titus,&quot; he said softly, though the golem was 
well beyond him. &quot;Cease and return to the earth. It is high time for us 
both to be returning to base. You, as usual, shall only show a portion 
of yourself; I shall speak as your voice. Come! Our master awaits us!&quot; 
The golem gave a low, earthy groan, and burrowed into the ground where 
it could move at incalculable speeds. It had returned to base almost 
instantly, despite being a hemisphere away, leaving barely enough rubble 
for the rats to sift through. The army was wasted, the people gone, and 
the message there to stay: Thou Shalt Not Cross the Dead Zodiac.

The old man arrived precisely on time, shoving aside the great entrance 
door as if it were made of paper. He strode in and made his presence 
known with a bow, humbling himself before his master. One by one, 
members of the group he led arrived, some gravitating more towards some 
people than others. A few looked eager to be there, some looked peeved. 
But they were all there, every last member of the Dead Zodiac&#151;all 
twelve, and their master, the thirteenth. He stood before them all and, 
as was his custom, smiled.

&quot;Welcome, Dead Zodiac. Ever since my second-in-command, the great 
Ezekiel, found you and brought you before me, I have relied on you to 
perform works that most people would be unable to: Titus the Golem, 
master of earth, you demolish and destroy; Sashuo the Crimson Blade, 
your troops spread the message of fear wherever you go; Indira, the 
one-man army, you have fought the deadliest foes; Jane of the Fang, my 
prized hunter; Yubami the Great-Bow, queen of all snipers; Naoma the 
Healer, who can recover any wound; Emily the Vanisher, my great spy; 
Darred the Numb-Mind, who influences men&#39;s thoughts with your words; 
Valmont the Summoner, a champion of animals and nature; Alia the 
Harmonious Killer, my great interrogator and warrior; Yan of the Air, 
the wind&#39;s very master; and Ezekiel, my Seeker, my greatest asset in 
this life, and the greatest of the Twelve. Welcome all.

&quot;You know why I have summoned you here?&quot; he continued. &quot;There is a 
certain girl I am looking for&#151;two, really. I have a feeling they are now 
working against me. You must put all of your resources and skills to 
this one task: you must find Pale, and the human called Kagemusha, or 
Stalker&#151;her name is Amielle Celestino. Find them, and bring them both to 
me alive, and undamaged. If anything stands in your way...it will soon 
regret it. That is your task, my Zodiac. Fail me not.&quot;

He flashed a deadly smile, and the Twelve dismissed themselves and 
spread out into the world, each approaching the hunt according to their 
own skills. The man in white, who had many names, knew that it was only 
a matter of time before the second half of his sojourn on that world 
would soon draw to a close...

Only a matter of time.

.........

Inside the sterility of the good doctor&#39;s room, Barner Henson rubbed his 
chin, wondering how the MERCS were going to get out of their mess. Dr. 
Kamaguchi seemed to be out of tricks and resources, and the pressure was 
building on them more and more as people&#151;special people with 
talents&#151;began using the MERCS&#39; resources. If progress was going to be 
made, the doctor would have to seriously start working, or else find a 
new means of research. He cleared his throat.

&quot;Excuse me.&quot; Yohko looked up from her studies.

&quot;Yes, Henson?&quot;

&quot;Doctor, you&#39;ve noticed how...wounded your secret operation has become 
in the past. While your formal operations are still thriving, in a 
sense, your informal&#151;all those skeletons in your closet&#151;is rotting away. 
Soon you will collapse on yourself. Your research has come to an end, 
doctor; you&#39;re out of subjects to experiment on.&quot;

&quot;Am I now?&quot; She gave him a look of guile and went back to her work. He 
growled.

&quot;I don&#39;t appreciate how nonchalant you are about this. You&#39;ve lost all 
your subjects: Wainright, Masterson, Project Sanaa, Kreager, that 
werewolf, the Lurker-child, that Inferno girl, everyone! And the 
facility that conducted these experiments was destroyed by fire, don&#39;t 
you remember?&quot;

&quot;I remember.&quot;

&quot;Reports are coming in that people with unusual abilities, calling 
themselves &#145;superheroes&#39;, are gathering together. Most of them are 
putting a stop to our business, and the ones helping us are very 
questionable. I am just in grave doubt about your abilities, doctor, and 
the way you&#39;re handling your brother&#39;s organization.&quot; Yohko didn&#39;t 
flinch when her brother was mentioned; she stood up calmly and faced 
Henson at eye level.

&quot;Henson, I do admit that we have lost a lot on all fronts, but that 
doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;ve lost everything. As a matter of fact, I&#39;ve 
retained two special operatives who could very easily tip the balance of 
power back in our favor, and I&#39;ve discovered the location of a third who 
could solidify it.&quot;

&quot;They had better be damned good, that&#39;s all I say.&quot;

&quot;They are better than that,&quot; she said happily. &quot;The first one you know, 
Pandora the Gambler.&quot;

&quot;You mean von Zomren?&quot; She noticed the look of surprise on his face and 
grinned.

&quot;That make you feel better, Henson? Yes, Pandora&#39;s been a secret ally of 
mine ever since my brother died. We see eye to eye on many things, so 
naturally we&#39;d team up. She&#39;s no &#145;superhero&#39;, as you say, but she could 
certainly put many in their place. She&#39;s already begun, as a matter of 
fact; I have her on a special mission.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; Henson rubbed his face, but couldn&#39;t erase the smile. So the 
infamous Pandora the Gambler was on their side, and had been for some 
time. That certainly made things easier to bear. &quot;And the other two?&quot;

&quot;Well the third is just a rumor, but one I&#39;m interested in. It&#39;s said 
that she improves the luck of everyone around her. I&#39;m not exactly a 
believer in that sort of thing, but if it works...&quot;

&quot;I see. If it&#39;s true, it could be a good help, so I can see why you&#39;d go 
after that. What about the second?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that?&quot; She gave him a dark smile, knelt by her desk, and pressed 
the intercom button. &quot;Yui, could you escort miss Jameson into my office 
now? I have someone who&#39;d like to meet her.&quot; She released the button and 
waited for Henson&#39;s inevitable query.

&quot;Who&#39;s miss Jameson?&quot;

&quot;Mr. Henson, even if I didn&#39;t have Pandora or this so-called Lady Luck, 
as long as I have my wild card in my hands, the world will still fall to 
its knees. The person you are about to meet is the greatest test subject 
I&#39;ve ever come across. She easily has the potential to become the most 
powerful human being in the entire world. I myself feel the touch of 
God, per se, whenever I&#39;m around her. Oh...she&#39;s a little sensitive, so 
try not to upset her.&quot;

&quot;Umm...&quot; Henson coughed and kept his tongue. The door opened, with Yui 
Miyamoto leading a young girl by the hand. She looked no more than 
twelve, was painfully shy, and held a scraggly brown teddy bear in her 
arm. She hung back and rubbed her eyes as Yui tried coaxing her into the 
office. Yohko thanked her longtime friend and took the girl inside, 
where she shyly stood in the corner, her eyes on the floor. Yohko knelt 
down to her level and spoke gently.

&quot;Joyce, this man is Mr. Henson. I want to introduce you to him since he 
is one of the people who is giving me money to run my business. Barner,&quot; 
she said, looking at him, &quot;this is Joyce Jameson, my pride and joy.&quot; The 
young girl meekly hid her face away as Henson examined her. He did not 
seem pleased.

&quot;Yohko, is this some kind of joke?&quot;

&quot;I assure you, I&#39;m quite serious.&quot;

&quot;But this is a child! And not a very capable-looking one at that. I&#39;d 
find better on any common school ground.&quot;

&quot;I do not believe you know what you are saying, Henson,&quot; she said 
coldly. &quot;There is more to Joyce than you know. I am too afraid to even 
ask her to give a short demonstration of her capabilities. Joyce,&quot; she 
said, kneeling down again, &quot;say hello to Mr. Henson.&quot; The girl weakly 
shook her head and wandered off, clutching her bear. &quot;Joyce, please, 
just say hello.&quot; Joyce refused.

&quot;She&#39;s rude, too.&quot; Yohko snorted and asked Joyce to follow Yui back to 
her room. After escorting the child out, she gave Henson a glare.

&quot;Don&#39;t push me, Henson. You haven&#39;t seen what that child can do. I have. 
She put somebody in the mental hospital for life without even lifting a 
finger.&quot;

&quot;So she has psychic abilities, so what? Miss Wainright had them and 
she&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;This child is beyond anything I&#39;ve encountered&#151;anything you&#39;ve 
encountered. It would be wise of you to not doubt my judgment or 
experience.&quot;

&quot;My doubts will not be quieted whether you ask them to or not.&quot; He 
huffed and excused himself; Yohko made a face and sighed. She had a mind 
to fully demonstrate to Mr. Henson just how dangerous Joyce was, but for 
the moment, she needed his support. When she was sure he had left the 
compound, she ducked inside the bathroom, and was not seen for some 
time.

Meanwhile, in Joyce&#39;s room, the young girl squeezed her teddy bear and 
began to cry softly...
