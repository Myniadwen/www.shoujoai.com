<h1>Tales of Sappho (part 3 of 3)</h1>

<a href="../original/talesappho-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Efterpi lounged out under the canopied veranda that was separated from 
the main apartment by a large heavy red curtain. She&#39;d only recently 
finished taking her bath (bringing a bathing tub to the room was a 
simple enough matter, but heating up enough water for a warm bath and 
lugging bucketful after bucketful into the room had taken awhile), and 
now sat back under the canopy, closing her eyes to take a nap. Clara 
meanwhile silently paced the room as she wondered where her beloved was 
and how she may have fared.

At length a knock came at the door, and Sappho stalked in. One look at 
her companion was enough to tell Clara that things had not gone as she&#39;d 
hoped. Getting up from the bed, she slowly walked over to her. &quot;Sappho 
my love?&quot; she said in a hushed tone so as not to be overheard by Efterpi 
behind the curtain, &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;Where is the girl?&quot; Sappho responded, nodding as Clara pointed to where 
the red curtain was. &quot;Well,&quot; Sappho sighed, &quot;This little enterprise is 
becoming more and more complicated by the minute.&quot; She then gave a rough 
outline of all that had happened, including the indecent demand for sex 
on the part of Lady Phedra.

&quot;You refused of course,&quot; Clara said almost as a half-question.

Sappho looked hurt, &quot;Of course I refused,&quot; she said, taking Clara&#39;s 
hands in hers as she added, &quot;Though that strumpet has no doubt had more 
Greeks in her than the Trojan horse, she&#39;ll not be adding my name to the 
list.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Clara said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I should&#39;ve known better than to 
even ask if you&#39;d been faithful. Still,&quot; she said pensively as she 
looked back at the curtain, &quot;It&#39;s a shame the poor girl won&#39;t be coming 
with us...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; Sappho asked as she stepped back a bit from 
Clara, &quot;Of course she&#39;s still coming with us!&quot;

&quot;What? B... But you just said...&quot;

&quot;I said that this whole thing had become more complicated, not 
impossible. We can&#39;t stow her away, she&#39;d be sure of being found. Still, 
that woman has made the mistake of angering me, and for that reason if 
for no other I...&quot; a knock at the door interrupted the poet&#39;s tirade. 
Clara went quickly to open it, and bowed respectfully as the Princess 
Gyrinna entered the room. The princess nodded her head politely to the 
older woman, then apprehensively turned and approached Sappho.

&quot;Sappho,&quot; Princess Gyrinna said nervously, &quot;I... I&#39;ve been sent by my 
father to invite you and your companion to a late brunch, but...&quot;

&quot;&#39;But&#39;?&quot; Sappho asked with raised eyebrow.

Gyrinna took a deep breath as she tried to calm herself. &quot;I know you&#39;re 
no doubt busy preparing for tonight&#39;s party, but I need to speak with 
you most urgently.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the poet answered, leading the princess further into the 
room as she quickly motioned for Clara to close the door, &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;My mother the queen, along with my father, wishes me to go with you to 
the Isle of Lesbos so that I might be educated in the social arts and 
thus be a good queen myself when the time comes. But, alas and alack, I 
do not wish to leave. By all the gods I...&quot; she was cut off by the sound 
of snickering.

&quot;&#39;Alas and alack?&#39;&quot; Sappho repeated with a smirk, &quot;Do people really talk 
like that here in Athens?&quot;

Gyrinna looked crest-fallen, &quot;Too much?&quot; she asked ruefully.

&quot;Not if you&#39;re a writer of tragedies or epic poetry, but otherwise yes, 
it was a bit over the top.&quot;

&quot;Sappho,&quot; Clara said with a stern look, &quot;Stop picking on the poor 
child.&quot;

Noting the look of discouragement on the young princess&#39; face, Sappho 
sighed and went over to her, &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said as she put an arm around 
Gyrinna&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Force of habit. Now then, what say we drop all the 
flowery prose and get to the point of why you don&#39;t want to leave 
Athens? It wouldn&#39;t happen to have anything to do with a certain young 
street performer you&#39;ve been sending love notes to, would it?&quot;

Gyrinna&#39;s eyes widened in shock, &quot;How do you know...&quot; she was cut off by 
Sappho placing a finger to her lips. The lyricist took the princess by 
the hand and led her back to the heavy red curtain in the back of the 
room.

Efterpi woke up to the sounds of the heavy canopy being drawn back. She 
opened her eyes lazily at first, but when she realized the young girl 
she loved from a distance was now here with her on the terrace her eyes 
shot open in excitement.

Both young ladies were speechless as they looked at one another, neither 
one knowing what to say now that they were finally really together. 
Finally, Sappho came up behind Princess Gyrinna and smiled. &quot;Princess 
Gyrinna,&quot; Sappho said as she motioned toward Efterpi, &quot;I&#39;d like you to 
meet a friend of mine. Her name&#39;s Efterpi, and don&#39;t let her shyness 
fool you; I think she likes you,&quot; she said with a wink.

&quot;S... Sappho,&quot; the princess whispered, &quot;How...&quot;

&quot;Never mind that,&quot; she said as she walked the princess over towards the 
other girl, &quot;Now Efterpi will be coming with us tomorrow when we leave 
for Lesbos, so I want you two to get to know one another while I go to 
brunch with Clara.&quot;

Gyrinna looked from Efterpi to Sappho, her eyes moistening as she hugged 
the older woman. &quot;Thank you. I don&#39;t know how or why, but thank you.&quot;

Sappho smiled warmly as she returned the hug. She then turned and, 
pulling the curtain back, left the two young lovers alone under the 
cloth canopy of the terrace, safe from prying eyes. She then looked over 
to Clara, who was smiling.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Clara conceded, &quot;They do look cute together. I can see why 
you&#39;re so adamant about helping now.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Sappho said returning the smile, &quot;We&#39;ll show that conniving 
stepmother yet.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Clara quipped as she crossed her arms, &quot;So what started out as 
a somewhat noble attempt to help out a poor pair of star-crossed lovers 
has now degenerated into a means to spite a woman who made the mistake 
of angering you?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Sappho replied. A few seconds of silence passed before both 
women broke out into laughter. &quot;Seriously though,&quot; Sappho chuckled, 
&quot;We&#39;d best head off to brunch, after which we&#39;ll still have to figure 
out how to get them both out of Athens with us.&quot;

&quot;Wait, we&#39;re going to leave them here alone? Unsupervised? Sappho, do 
you have any idea what might happen?&quot;

&quot;Nothing if we don&#39;t give them their privacy,&quot; she replied with a wink, 
&quot;Now come,&quot; she said as she turned to leave the room. Clara shook her 
head in exasperation and followed soon after.

As they walked through the royal halls, a set of footsteps announced 
that they were no longer alone. &quot;Sappho,&quot; Clara whispered.

&quot;I know,&quot; the poet murmured, &quot;We&#39;re being followed,&quot; she said, adding 
with a sigh, &quot;Probably a servant wondering why we aren&#39;t already at the 
royal meal. Just ignore them and...&quot; a tap on the shoulder caused Sappho 
to pause mid-sentence. Turning around, she saw Queen Deianira standing 
in a purple and beige toga that showed off her ample cleavage. She had 
an aquiline nose that always seemed to be stuck up in the air, and her 
honey-yellow hair was done up in curls and a gold tiara resting proudly 
on her head.

&quot;Sappho, I need to speak with you,&quot; she said, adding with a disdainful 
look to Clara, &quot;Alone, if you please.&quot;

Sappho frowned; she&#39;d disliked the queen ever since first meeting her 
yesterday, and was about to lash out at her for slighting her love, when 
Clara herself intervened. &quot;It&#39;s alright, I&#39;ll wait for you in the dining 
hall,&quot; she said as she gave Sappho a pleading look, silently imploring 
her not to insult their too much.

Sappho silently watched her companion walk off. As Clare walked around a 
corner, the poet was startled by a pair of arms reaching around to hug 
her from behind. &quot;M... My good woman,&quot; she gasped, &quot;What on earth do you 
think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot; the queen purred as she rubbed up against the 
smaller woman&#39;s back.

Sappho scowled, &quot;Not you too.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she responded deadpan as she pulled herself away from 
Deianira, &quot;Does the king know what you&#39;re up to?&quot;

Deianira laughed. &quot;Of course not,&quot; she said, adding, &quot;He never knows, 
that&#39;s part of the fun.&quot;

As upset as she was, Sappho couldn&#39;t help but smirk at the answer, 
&quot;Maybe so, but...&quot;

&quot;Oh, right,&quot; the queen interrupted derisively, &quot;Her. Well, if it&#39;ll make 
you feel better we can invite her as well I guess. Or better yet, I know 
this young boy who tends the palace gardens. He stutters a bit, but he 
more than makes up for it with the size of his enormous...&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure he does,&quot; Sappho interrupted, pinching the bridge of her 
nose as she felt a headache coming on, &quot;Again, I&#39;m very flattered 
but...&quot;

Queen Deianira sighed, &quot;Very well. But don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to give up 
on you, Sappho of Lesbos. I&#39;ll be looking for you tonight at the party,&quot; 
she said as she turned to leave, but not before causing the famous 
lyricist to let out a surprised screech when she smacked her playfully 
in the rear.

Sappho reached behind to feel her butt, rolling her eyes as she did so. 
In her youth, she was courted by the best and brightest of Lesbos, both 
men and women. She&#39;d been lover to fellow poet and mentor Alcaeus, as 
well as some of the most beautiful and handsome members of the artistic 
and musical community, who were able to stimulate her thoughts and 
imagination as well as her body.

&quot;Now look at me,&quot; she grumbled under her breath, &quot;All I seem capable of 
attracting nowadays are lascivious queens and avaricious stepmothers. 
Thank the gods I&#39;ve Clara, or else I&#39;d go mad.&quot; She quickly shook 
herself out of her momentary self-pity to focus on the more pressing 
matter of how to get Lady Phaedra&#39;s signature on a release for Efterpi 
without having to give into her demands.

She closed her eyes and slowed down her breathing. &quot;Aphrodite,&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;Deathless daughter of Zeus, something tells me you&#39;re 
laughing at your servant from your golden palace on Mt. Olympus. I ask 
of your help now once again. The girl Efterpi and Princess Gyrinna love 
one another and I wish to help them if I can, but there are so many 
obstructions. Tell me, what would you have your Sappho do?&quot; Her prayer 
finished, she opened her consciousness up as she waited patiently for 
her Patroness to answer her.

Suddenly, the corners of Sappho&#39;s lips began to rise into a wide grin. 
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s wicked,&quot; she whispered with an almost malevolent cackle, 
&quot;Wicked, but absolutely perfect!&quot; Opening her eyes, she hurried to the 
dining hall to join Clara at brunch. She now knew what to do, and once 
the meal was over both Clara and herself would be busy setting up for 
tonight.

------

As Helios in his fiery chariot neared the end of his daily route and the 
sun began to set, Athenian Senators, nobles and wealthy merchants who&#39;d 
received invitation began to arrive at the palace for the farewell gala 
for Princess Gyrinna. Some were happy for her and her parents, while 
others were sad to see the beautiful and courteous maiden go. Most 
however were here for the promise of sumptuous food, strong drink, and 
the chance to hear one of Sappho&#39;s songs performed on the lyre by the 
woman herself.

Meanwhile, in the royal apartment set aside for Sappho and Clara, final 
preparations were being made...

&quot;Now then,&quot; Sappho said to Efterpi, &quot;When we leave to go to the party, 
count to a thousand and then take some of the powdered soot in the 
leather satchel on the dresser next to the curtain, mix it in the clay 
bowl next to it with some water and a bit of the gum in this jar,&quot; she 
said, placing the red clay jar in her hand, &quot;And once the ink is of a 
smooth consistency, go out through the curtain onto the terrace and 
remain as quiet as possible. No matter what you hear or what may happen, 
do not come out unless Clara or I come to get you.&quot;

&quot;This idea is crazy,&quot; Clara muttered.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Sappho responded, &quot;But it&#39;s Aphrodite&#39;s plan, and for the 
moment it&#39;s the only one we have. Now do you know your part?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to know?&quot; she asked with a shrug, &quot;I pour wine and make sure to 
lead Queen Deianira to the apartment at the given time. But if something 
should go wrong...&quot;

&quot;Nothing will as long as everyone plays their role properly.&quot;

&quot;Mistress Sappho,&quot; Gyrinna interrupted, &quot;Isn&#39;t there anything I can do 
to help?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you can do your best to keep that covered,&quot; she said, pointing to 
a small hickey on her neck that Efterpi gave her, &quot;Other than that, no. 
The less you&#39;re involved in all this, the better.&quot;

&quot;Perhapse, but I wish I could do something. If only I could just explain 
my feelings to my parents. Why can&#39;t they understand and accept my 
feelings?&quot;

&quot;Because they&#39;re parents,&quot; Sappho answered, &quot;And parents and children 
have been at odds ever since Zeus castrated his father Cronos, so I 
doubt that&#39;s going to change any time soon. Now come,&quot; she said, leading 
the way as she opened the door. Efterpi watched the three of them leave 
and then began her counting.

A few minutes later Sappho, staff in hand, entered the large hall set up 
for the party accompanied by Princess Gyrinna and Clara, who was 
carrying the poet&#39;s ornate gold lyre with inlaid ivory decorations she&#39;d 
brought from Lesbos. The three were met by applause from the assembled 
guests, and as the princess was surrounded by well-wishers and Clara 
carried the lyre to a sort of makeshift stage platform near the back of 
the room, Sappho began to make her way through the party guests. As the 
poet scanned the crowd, a balding aristocrat with his wife, along with 
another couple, made their way towards her.

&quot;Madam,&quot; the man said with a smile, &quot;Are you truly Sappho?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; she said, hardly paying any attention as she continued to 
look around at the other guests, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the nobleman said, &quot;My wife and I, as well as our friends here,&quot; 
he said as he motioned to his wealthy friends, &quot;Wish to ask you a 
question.&quot;

Sappho now turned her attention to the lord, &quot;Very well,&quot; she said with 
a smile, &quot;Ask.&quot;

&quot;Well, you were married and had a child with your husband, correct? And 
both before and after your marriage you were romantically involved with 
both men and women. Just out of curiosity,&quot; he asked as he lowered his 
voice, &quot;Which do you prefer, men or women?&quot;

Sappho put her hand to her chin as she considered the matter, a hush 
falling among her listeners as they awaited her answer. &quot;Well...&quot; she 
said at last, &quot;Each has their strengths and weaknesses I suppose, but in 
the end I have to say I prefer women over men. Oh sure, men are far less 
likely to backbite, but women are far more attentive, much more soft and 
tender, and far less likely to leave you sore the next morning. Now if 
you&#39;ll excuse me,&quot; she said with a bow of the head before turning to 
look once more for her prey. As she walked off, she could hear the noble 
teasing his wife by suggesting that she&#39;d been eyeing her while 
answering his question. As his wife began to giggle, she finally saw one 
of her quarry.

Lady Phedra looked to be where she felt most comfortable; at the center 
of attention. Dressed far more conservatively than she&#39;d been when 
Sappho last saw her, a small group of admirers laughed at a naughty bit 
of gossip she&#39;d just shared. As an aged senator began to raise a point, 
she finished the drink in her hand. Sappho looked around and, finding a 
large pitcher of wine on a nearby table to her right, picked it up.

&quot;That may be, Senator Myron,&quot; Phedra responded, smiling graciously as 
her listeners seemed to eat up every word poured forth from her mouth as 
if it came from the oracle at Delphi itself, &quot;But is the Spartans and 
Macedonians truly feel that way then...&quot; She stopped when she felt a 
weight in her right hand. Looking over, she saw Sappho, pitcher in hand, 
refilling her cup. &quot;Why look everyone,&quot; she said, refusing to show 
surprise as she kept up appearances, &quot;It&#39;s my good friend, the great 
Sappho.&quot;

Sappho looked into Phedra&#39;s amber eyes and smiled, &quot;To Dionysus,&quot; she 
said with a smile, pulling the pitcher away. Feeling a hand on her 
shoulder, the poet turned to see her companion Clara, &quot;Is the lyre 
ready?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; the younger woman responded, adding &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to be 
good enough to introduce us?&quot;

&quot;Oh, where are my manners. Lady Phedra, this is my beloved, Clara. 
Clara, this is my... good friend, the Lady Phedra.&quot; Clara nodded her 
head respectfully, while Phedra simply cast a cold glare back. &quot;Now 
Clara, be a dear and make sure to keep Phedra&#39;s cup full at all times. 
And let there be none of that watering down of her drink either; she&#39;s a 
cultured lady, and she can take it strong like we of Lesbos do.&quot;

Lady Phedra raised an eyebrow at that; wine in Athens, as well as in the 
rest of the ancient Greek world, was extremely strong. So strong in 
fact, that it was customary to dilute it with a bit of water to make it 
less potent. By saying she would drink it strong, the poet had put 
Phedra on the spot as it were in front of those she was eager to 
impress, and she could not afford to lose face here at the palace.

&quot;Yes, of course,&quot; Phedra responded, &quot;I should like my drink straight, 
just as Sappho says.&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Clara answered before turning around to disappear once more 
in the crowd. Sappho watched her leave, then turned her attention back 
to Lady Phedra.

&quot;Have you thought of our conversation earlier, &#39;friend&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Have you made your decision.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sappho answered. She leaned in close and whispered in her ear so 
those around them couldn&#39;t hear, &quot;We will leave together for the royal 
apartment King Adrastos has set up for me, and I on a soft pillow will 
lay down my limbs for you,&quot; she then ever so softly stroked Phedra&#39;s 
earlobe with the tip of her tongue before turning to leave.

As a momentarily stunned Phedra watched her disappear into the crowd, 
Sappho found Clara and together they began to look for Queen Deianira. 
They had not been looking long before the Queen herself found them.

&quot;There you are!&quot;

Sappho and Clara both jumped a bit as they spun around to face the 
queen, &quot;Queen Deianira, what a pleasant surprise. Clara,&quot; she said as 
she turned to her companion, &quot;Be a dear and fetch the queen some wine. 
And don&#39;t be watering it down this time; she&#39;s a queen, she can take it 
strong.&quot;

Deianira smiled at the suggestion, and as Clara left she came closer to 
the poet, &quot;I told you I wouldn&#39;t give up.&quot;

&quot;So you did,&quot; Sappho responded, &quot;And I&#39;m glad to hear it.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;I was a fool, Deianira, a stupid fool, for ever since I first saw you 
Eros shook my mind like a fallen wind falling on oak trees,&quot; she said, 
trying to summon up as much of her poetic elegance as she could to woo 
the queen, &quot;You came and I was crazy for you, and you cooled my mind 
that burned with longing when you held me in the hall. I dared not give 
in though, for fear of your husband, but I can hold back no longer.&quot;

Queen Deianira was dumbfounded, &quot;Oh, Sappho...&quot; she began, only to stop 
as Clara came over with a cup of wine for her.

&quot;Clara,&quot; Sappho said, &quot;Later tonight, take the queen to my chambers. In 
the meantime, keep her cup full.&quot;

Clara nodded her head and walked off. Sappho then turned to Queen 
Deianira and, mindful that no prying eyes should see, leaned in close. 
&quot;Tonight,&quot; she said softly as she planted a kiss on the Queen&#39;s cheek. 
She left her and made her way back to where she saw the king. Adrastos 
saw her coming towards him and smiled graciously.

&quot;Ah, at last,&quot; he said joyfully as he now addressed the crowd, &quot;Ladies 
and gentleman, in honor of my daughter Princess Gyrinna&#39;s departure, 
Sappho of Lesbos has graciously agreed to entertain us with some of her 
songs.&quot; As the attendants applauded and the king moved aside, Sappho 
walked past him towards the low stage set up for her. As she sat down 
upon a stool provided for her, she brought the lyre up and balanced it 
on her right knee. After playing a few opening notes, she began to sing.

You, o Dika, bind your hair with lovely crowns,
tying stems of anise together in your soft hands.
For the blessed Graces prefer to look on one who wears flowers
and turning away from those without a crown...

As she sang, out in the audience, Clara silently refilled Lady Phedra&#39;s 
cup.

And many gold bracelets and purple
perfumed clothes, painted toys,
and silver cups innumerable and ivory...

Queen Deianira, lost in the silvery tones and haunting melody, 
absentmindedly sipped from her now half-empty cup of wine. As she 
withdrew it from her lips, Clara came up next to her and quickly 
refilled it to the brim as Sappho continued her song.

...and sweetflowing flute and kithara were mingled
with the clip of castanets and piercingly then the maidens
sang a holy song and straight up the air went
amazing sound...

And so the evening went, with Sappho singing her songs of love and loss 
and tenderness as Clara continually filled Lady Phedra&#39;s and Queen 
Deianira&#39;s wine goblets. Neither women gulped their wine down; indeed, 
both were careful to merely sip. Because of this, and because neither 
one&#39;s cup ever went below halfway before Clara filled them, the effects 
of the wine snuck up on the two women unwittingly.

After an hour and a half, Sappho ended the concert to a standing 
ovation. Taking her bows, she quickly made her way to where a now tipsy 
Lady Phedra stood waiting for her, swaying in place like a reed blown by 
the east wind.

&quot;Sa-a-apho,&quot; she slurred out, &quot;Th... The ti-ime has come.&quot;

&quot;And so it has,&quot; Sappho said with a smile. Taking her leave of the king 
and the assembled guests, Sappho gave Clara a knowing look before 
offering her arm to Phedra. Clara watched the two women leave, and began 
to slowly count to a hundred before she made her move.

&quot;I&#39;m sur... surprised you g-gave in,&quot; Phedra said as she leaned heavily 
on Sappho for support, the poet leading the way to the apartment.

&quot;Well, in the end I realized I was beaten. Besides,&quot; she said as she 
stopped and opened her door, &quot;As you said yourself, your not exactly 
unattractive.&quot;

Phedra laughed at that as the two crossed the threshold. Inside the 
apartment was dark, with no lamp lighted. Sappho led her to the 
cushioned bed and sat her down. &quot;I have to go to take care of 
toiletries,&quot; she said in a sultry tone as she leaned in and kissed her 
softly on the lips, &quot;But I&#39;ll be back momentarily, I promise.&quot;

&quot;H-hurry,&quot; Lady Phedra pleaded as the poet got up and exited the room.

Once she&#39;d closed the door behind her, Sappho quickly went further up 
the hallway, took a turn down a side corridor, and made her way back to 
the party by a different route. While she was heading back around, 
elsewhere Clara was leading Queen Deianira to the royal apartment for 
her date with Sappho.

&quot;Y- you say sh... she&#39;s already in there?&quot; the queen asked.

Clara nodded, &quot;She&#39;s waiting for you in the large bed in the back right 
corner of the room. She asks only that you not bring in any lamps or 
candles. She likes it better when it&#39;s dark,&quot; she added as she opened 
the door to the queen.

Deianira smiled happily and, in her drunken state, stumbled forward into 
the dark room where she soon enough found the bed. Feeling blindly 
around, she felt the figure of a woman and, supposing it to be Sappho, 
climbed into bed with her. Soon enough, mouth found mouth and tongue met 
tongue as clothing was shed.

It was then that Sappho, accompanied by King Adrastos, came around the 
corner towards the room.

&quot;It&#39;s all very simple,&quot; Sappho said in a reassuring tone, &quot;We just need 
to go over some of the finer points of your daughter&#39;s tuition.&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, I understand,&quot; the king muttered, &quot;But I don&#39;t see why this 
couldn&#39;t wait until...&quot;

&quot;We leave early tomorrow morning,&quot; Sappho explained as she reached over 
for a small lamp in an alcove on the wall, &quot;And while I could care less 
for legal matters, your nobles and my own government may later make much 
ado over these little details,&quot; she said as she passed the lamp to the 
king. Then, grabbing a second lamp for herself, she went and opened the 
door.

Lit up by Sappho and Adrastos&#39; lamplight was a startling scene indeed; 
at first the king wasn&#39;t sure what to make of the writhing figures in 
the shadows, but bringing the light closer his jaw dropped. &quot;Deianira!&quot; 
he cried out, &quot;What in Hades do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

The queen looked up from between Phedra&#39;s legs, &quot;Adrastos!&quot; she shrieked 
fearfully, &quot;It&#39;s n... not what you th-ink, I...&quot; it was then that she 
saw Sappho standing next to her husband, and in bewilderment looked over 
at the woman she was straddling, &quot;W... who-o-o are y... you?&quot; she asked, 
&quot;I... I thought y-ou were Sa... Sappho.&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; an equally puzzled Lady Phedra gasped as she tried to get out from 
under the queen, &quot;I th... thought you were Sappho!&quot;

The king, queen, and Phedra all exchanged confused glances with one 
another before all three turned to Sappho. The poet now strode forward, 
ignoring King Adrastos and Lady Phedra as she addressed Deianira, 
&quot;Thought she was me?&quot; she asked, &quot;Of all the impudence! You think I 
would bring shame upon the good King of Athens on the eve of his 
daughter&#39;s departure for my finishing school by making him a cuckold? 
I... No, wait!&quot; she said as she turned to face the king, &quot; Now I see it 
all; this was all a ruse, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;A ruse?&quot; Adrastos asked, taken off-guard by the befuddling accusation, 
&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;I see it all now,&quot; Sappho growled, narrowing her eyes at the king as 
she feigned anger, &quot;You thought to take advantage of both my good name 
and my reputation, you bring me here under pretense of diplomacy, and 
then you try to trap me in a compromising position,&quot; she said, pointing 
at the two drunks on the bed, &quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself! What 
did you hope to blackmail out of me? Did you think I brought some sort 
of treasure with me, or was it something else? I came here on a mission 
of peace on my government&#39;s behalf, in good will, agreeing to admit your 
daughter into my school, and all the while you&#39;ve intended to bring 
shame down upon me! When word reaches Lesbos of the way that Sappho, her 
favored daughter, has been mistreated by King Adrastos of Athens...&quot;

The king was horrified; the last thing he needed was for enmity to once 
more ignite between Lesbos and Athens (especially when Lesbos had 
defeated them so thoroughly the last time they came to blows). &quot;N... 
No,&quot; Adrastos stuttered out, &quot;I&#39;ve no idea of what&#39;s happened here, or 
why my wife and this harlot are lying in wait for you, I swear! Please, 
the last thing I ever wanted was to offend you, or to strain relations 
once more between our lands,&quot; he pleaded, adding, &quot;I&#39;ll make this up to 
you, I swear! I&#39;ll bring both these rascals, my wife Deianira and her 
lover, to the square tomorrow before you leave to have them both 
stripped and flogged publicly for this insult.&quot;

&quot;W... What?&quot; Lady Phedra asked fearfully.

&quot;Aaaadrastos,&quot; Queen Deianira slurred out, &quot;Y... You ca-a-ant be 
s-serious...&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; the king roared, &quot;You&#39;ve cheated on me in my own palace, and 
made me a laughingstock!&quot;

&quot;King,&quot; Sappho said, her tone now soothing as she rested a hand on the 
deceived monarch&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Wait, please. I... I spoke overly hasty 
just now, I see that now. Clearly you are just as wronged in this whole 
affair as I am, and you knew no more about this than I did. But at the 
moment only you and I know of your cuckolded shame. Were you to deliver 
these two wretches to be publicly scourged all of Athens really would 
know your shame, and you truly would be a laughing stock.&quot;

The king&#39;s fury was now abated a bit by Sappho&#39;s carefully chosen words. 
&quot;You&#39;re right of course,&quot; he muttered, adding, &quot;What do we do then?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Sappho said, turning her gaze to Phedra, &quot;Unless my eyes deceive 
me, the woman laying in bed with your wife is none other than Lady 
Phedra, the woman whom I&#39;d asked earlier to turn her stepdaughter over 
to me. No doubt this was mainly her plan,&quot; the poet said thoughtfully as 
she stroked her chin, &quot;Probably hoping to extort more of a price out of 
me for the girl than I&#39;d been willing to pay for her. However, I&#39;m a 
poet of love, and sworn to the service of gracious Aphrodite. I&#39;ll 
forget all that has transpired this evening, and I&#39;ll even ask clemency 
for both your wife and Phedra, in exchange for her signing over the 
stepdaughter to me, no strings attached.&quot;

Even in her inebriated state, Lady Phedra was finally able to pull the 
threads together, &quot;W... Why you l- little...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll do it,&quot; the king snarled menacingly, &quot;Or by all the gods 
I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;Adrastos,&quot; Sappho reproached gravely, &quot;Remember; I myself, chosen by 
the gods, have asked clemency. Now then,&quot; she said as she reached under 
her robe and retrieved a small scroll, &quot;I just so happen to have drawn 
up this little document earlier for her to sign, and still have it on me 
from when I visited the stepmother earlier. I was going to finish my 
poem I&#39;d begun beneath your roof, so there should be a fresh bottle of 
ink on the dresser,&quot; she said, pointing to the ink Efterpi had mixed 
earlier in the evening, &quot;If she signs this now we can forget all about 
this unfortunate incident.&quot; Turning to Phedra, her eyes narrowed as she 
held up the contract. &quot;Well?&quot; she asked with a smirk, &quot;What do you say?&quot;

------

The next morning, as a large crowd assembled on the docks, a pair of 
figures looked on from a nearby rooftop.

&quot;Mom,&quot; a rather portly girl asked, &quot;Are you still feeling sick?&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; Phedra hissed, her head still aching from the 
excessive drinking of the previous night.

The girl looked back down at the group at the port, &quot;I don&#39;t get it. If 
me and sis aren&#39;t going to Lesbos then why are we here?&quot;

&quot;Because,&quot; she growled, &quot;I want to see that bitch leave with my own 
eyes.&quot;

Down at the pier, after explaining that the queen had come down with an 
illness and couldn&#39;t attend, King Adrastos and Princess Gyrinna hugged 
each other tenderly, father and daughter then separating as the princess 
boarded the ship where Sappho, Clara and Efterpi were awaiting her. 
Weighing anchor, they were soon underway, and as Efterpi and Gyrinna 
watched Athens slowly disappear from view, on the other side of the ship 
Clara walked over to Sappho, who smiled contentedly at her. &quot;Well,&quot; she 
said smugly, &quot;Didn&#39;t I tell you Aphrodite&#39;s plan would work?&quot;

&quot;Humph, &#39;Aphrodite&#39;s plan&#39; indeed,&quot; Clara said dismissively as she 
crossed her arms, &quot;You could&#39;ve started another war between Lesbos and 
Athens, you rascal.&quot;

At that Sappho&#39;s face lit up, &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she said as she came towards 
Clara, &quot;I&#39;m a rascal and worse, a scoundrel, a monster even! But then,&quot; 
she said as she wrapped her arms around her beloved, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t have 
me any other way, would you?&quot; with that, she brought her lips to 
Clara&#39;s, even as elsewhere on the boat the two Athenian maidens Efterpi 
and Gyrinna likewise enjoyed love&#39;s embrace.

-Finis-

End notes: Several portions of Sappho&#39;s dialogue with Lady Phedra and 
Queen Deianira actually came from fragments of the poet&#39;s extant poems. 
For example, &quot;...and I on a soft pillow will lay down my limbs...&quot; comes 
from fragment 46, while &quot;...Eros shook my mind like a mountain wind 
falling on oak trees,&quot; comes from fragment 47.

I&#39;m glad so many people seem to have liked this little tale, and 
hopefully everyone will enjoy future episodes just as much.</pre>
