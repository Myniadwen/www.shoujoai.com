&quot;Endurance&quot;

Andeira Torvald was just finishing her resignation papers when a knock 
came at the door&#151;was it opportunity? No, she knew better than 
that&#151;probably some student or teacher come by to beg her to stay. She 
opened the door and found Kula Nanahara on the other end&#151;not necessarily 
a surprise, since the fiery young woman was both a student and a 
confidante. Torvald was one of the few teachers whom Kula trusted and 
liked, probably because she knew the pain of leaving one&#39;s home very 
well, and also things like a language barrier were absent between them 
(Torvald spoke both Hawaiian and Japanese, amongst others). But on that 
day, well after classes had ended, she was surprised to find the 
hotheaded Kula weeping.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, maternal instincts rising once again. She 
didn&#39;t know how long Kula had been like that, but apparently the sight 
of a trusted friend and mentor uncorked whatever plug kept the dam at 
bay, and Kula rushed forth to be held in Torvald&#39;s arms. She even let 
out a cruel wail as she tried to explain herself.

&quot;They&#39;re taking her away,&quot; she managed. &quot;They found out about us. We 
were so careful! So careful, and they found out. They&#39;re moving her 
again. What am I gonna do, T?&quot; Andeira&#39;s heart, broken though it already 
was after so many years of torment, went out to the poor woman, and she 
put her arms around Kula, offering some meager protection in this storm 
of hers.

&quot;Oh, honey, I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she whispered. As Kula broke down and wept, 
Andeira Torvald knew that one of the great romances Stanton would ever 
know had reached its finale.

Late February, that same year...

When Usha Krishnan broke up with me, I was destroyed. I fell in love 
with the woman I hated, and I was so sure our passion would last and 
last, hot and swirling like the sun, until even the end of all things 
was powerless to stop us. But then she went and trampled over me, 
telling me that she had deceived us both. &quot;My heart was not into this,&quot; 
she said, or some trash like that. Whatever. It was such a big mess that 
I barely even remember it. All I could feel was anger&#151;no, not anger, but 
rage, pure and undiminishing. I hated and loved Usha, and now I lost 
her&#151;that fiend, that beauty, that creature who captured my heart and 
choked it with razor wire. And she was gone, off on a quest of truth, to 
find someone she wouldn&#39;t need to deceive. She ended up with Blake, of 
all people, right back to where she had begun, leaving me in the cold.

Just until now, I had forgotten how much I really hated the cold. I 
vaguely remember despising that frosty chill&#151;after all, Hawaii was a 
tropical paradise, and the most frigid days there are heatwaves on the 
mainland&#151;I hated the snow, I hated the ice and sleet, and the layers 
upon layers of jackets, coats, mittens, scarves, and mufflers I was 
forced to wear because of it. With Usha, I never did really feel 
cold&#151;our passion was too fiery&#151;but with her gone...I was thrust into the 
ninth circle of Hell, darker and deeper and colder that the most distant 
reaches of space. And I wept, too. But not for long. My anger consumed 
me again.

Let&#39;s just fast-forward in time, okay? To spring break; that&#39;s when 
things started looking up. One day I was sent to detention&#151;as usual, for 
starting or participating in a fight&#151;and I had to endure Keeping&#39;s sweet 
scathing presence all over again. Sigh. Psychologists&#151;what&#39;re you gonna 
do? Anyway, I just sat there quiet until another kid came in; I was the 
only one until then. I guess I was the only bad girl left that Stanton 
hadn&#39;t broken! Anyway, when I saw her come in, I gave a little smirk. 
Sweet adorable Mihoshi, sent to detention for dueling, or whatever 
nonsense was going through her head now. I was glad that a familiar face 
would be joining me, and hailed her over to my seat. From the look of 
her face, she was glad to see me, too.

What a bold girl! She challenged me to a duel right there in detention! 
I said yes, of course&#151;I needed to whack something, and Yuki was one of 
the few people I knew of who would fight back. I also knew that, in her 
mind, challenging someone to a duel was her way of saying &quot;I like you&quot;, 
and that I accepted suggested that I liked her too. Why? Oh, I dunno. I 
mean, she was really cute, and pretty strong and stubborn from what I 
heard, but there was something else, too. I think I was one of the few 
people who really got a kick out of hearing her say all that Bushido 
nonsense. I just laughed and smiled, not in a mean way, and wondered 
what cool saying she&#39;d come up with next. I think I had a crush on her 
well before our first shy kiss on New Year&#39;s.

As we went outside, I couldn&#39;t help but stare at her. The weather was 
now very warm and slightly windy, quite easily a perfect day. Spring was 
in full bloom, but I missed the exotic flora of my native land. Even as 
I reflected on this, though, something more beautiful and exotic stood 
before me, her snow-white hair flapping in the breeze like a banner. I 
held my breath and stared at this thing, not knowing whether it was 
really a girl or a goddess.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; I told her that windy day. She had such a cute 
smile!

&quot;Arigato. Are you ready?&quot; I had been given a shinai, a bamboo sword, and 
bowed politely to my opponent. Yuki was absolutely striking in the wind, 
wearing not school clothes but the gi and hakama of a real master, and 
her white hair, flecked with red, made her all the more ethereal. I 
began to wonder what powers were in effect that would lead me to face 
this beauty, and why I had never really noticed before. Being drawn into 
your own world, especially one of anger, does that to ya.

At first we fought professionally, but soon every grievance I felt in 
the past came resurfacing. The move away from Paradise into Hell. The 
increasingly cold weather. Usha the Bitch. The Homecoming dance. The 
Protest. The War. The Tsunami. The death of Johnny Carson. Usha&#39;s two 
girlfriends. Our breakup. Everything. Every injustice I had felt was now 
being delivered in full physical force, against this humble individual 
who I had begun to like: stroke after stroke, like a lumberjack, until 
even the redwood called Kogure fell, struck down by my violence.

It&#39;s a good thing I came to my senses.

&quot;Ohmygod, I&#39;m so sorry! I didn&#39;t mean...&quot; But Yuki, damn her, smiled 
through the tears of pain. I had never told her why I acted the way I 
did. We were never as close as we could&#39;ve been; never the way I wanted 
to be. She didn&#39;t know, and yet...

&quot;What strength!&quot; she whispered, clutching her torso. &quot;What a skill! 
You...are truly...my superior...oh!&quot; She stumbled as she rose; I was 
there to help her. I took her hand and held it, and felt just how rough, 
how worn-out, how perfectly beautiful and calloused it was. I think my 
heart skipped a beat. Our eyes met. I felt shame. I really did cry this 
time&#151;&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Yuki. I didn&#39;t mean to.&quot; But what else could I say? 
I had no right to get mad at her. Yuki never did me any harm. She had 
always been good to me. I&#39;d&#39;ve been better off hitting myself with that 
stick!

I then let it all out, why I was so mad. It just blurted out from my 
mouth, words and words, until I had spoken a whole volume and was tired. 
I told her everything, as if an explanation would really excuse me. But 
she sat next to me anyway, so pretty and patient, and she was still 
there when I was finished. Then, she did the unthinkable, and took my 
hand. It was such a beautiful feeling, us and the wind and nothing else. 
She leaned over to kiss my cheek, pulled back a little, smiled, and 
blushed.

&quot;You have a strong spirit, Kula-chan,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Stronger than 
mine. You have persevered through much sorrow, and still managed to come 
out fine.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not fine, Yuki, I&#39;m messed up. You saw me, you felt it.&quot;

&quot;But you were not mad at me.&quot; A pause.

&quot;No, I wasn&#39;t. I...actually like you. A whole lot.&quot; She looked over to 
smile at me, and once again, I let flow my words. &quot;I know a lot of 
people can&#39;t stand to be around you because they think you&#39;re weird. 
Well, a lot of people can&#39;t stand to be around me because they think I&#39;m 
dangerous&#151;which is true, by the way. But I don&#39;t think you&#39;re weird,&quot; I 
added, slowly caressing that sweet field of moonlit flax. &quot;I like you. 
You&#39;re funny, you&#39;re sweet, and you&#39;re the bravest woman I know of. And 
I think all that Bushido stuff you shout out is really awesome.&quot; Poor 
Yuki was summer rose red by this point, bashful and quiet, our hands now 
intertwined.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re dangerous,&quot; she whispered, competing with the 
wind. &quot;I really like you too. You&#39;re very strong, and you&#39;re very 
honest, and you know when you are wrong. I am personally attracted to 
the kind of fiery passion that must go coursing through your veins every 
moment of your life.&quot;

&quot;Stop it,&quot; I giggled, &quot;you&#39;re embarrassing me!&quot; We both shared a smile, 
grinning like silly little idiots, and slowly found our way to each 
other&#39;s eyes. We stared for eons. The moon and the sun might&#39;ve 
crumbled, and the world brought to ruin, but that stare would&#39;ve 
remained for all of time, a &quot;Connection&quot;, if you will, of hearts, minds, 
and souls. She touched my cheek, the one she had kissed, with her hand.

&quot;Remember that kiss we shared on New Year&#39;s?&quot; she whispered. I nodded. 
&quot;I liked that. Do you...&quot; I answered her question, though she trailed 
off without ever finishing it. I leaned in and took her pearly lips by 
surprise&#151;first cautiously, then with invigoration, and finally wild, 
explosive passion. I had read several erotic stories where girls always 
yammered on and on about how their lover&#39;s lips were so soft, and I 
really had no idea what that meant. Usha tasted pretty good, but I dunno 
about soft: well, Mihoshi&#39;s lips were soft, and I mean that in a wild, 
dangerous, exciting, rock-and-roll, tidal wave, mind-blowing way (all 
that and more). We didn&#39;t just kiss, we yearned for each other, 
smothering and smunching with a flame far greater than desperation, and 
it lasted too long and too short.

I guess I can safely call it love.

We never called ourselves girlfriends or anything flowery after that, 
but one shared look between us, and we knew what was going on. We 
must&#39;ve went on a hundred dates and took part in a hundred romantic 
activities, some so meaningless and trite that they were beautiful. We 
used to lie out in the park for hours, immersing ourselves in the leaves 
of grass, holding each other&#39;s hands and watching the clouds pass us by. 
I being somewhat good with the Japanese language, we could speak to each 
other in a tongue that comforted us both, especially Mihoshi, who told 
me of her home country and how she, too, hated being torn apart from 
there.

&quot;I left behind my very first crush,&quot; she said with a blush. &quot;Her name 
was Mika, and she was the one who really opened me up to the ways of 
Bushido. Up until meeting her, it was just a passing fancy, a belief I 
had. I always did tell people I was descended from a great samurai 
warrior&#151;a woman, no less&#151;but Mika really brought it out of me. We were 
both cheerleaders too, and very fierce rivals, but good friends as well. 
She was so kind and friendly...and really pretty.&quot;

&quot;Did ya see her naked?&quot; I asked her. Yuki laughed quietly.

&quot;Well, when one is a cheerleader, one sees many young women in that 
state. But...nothing came of it. I never told her how I felt. I was too 
scared of my parents finding out. I never heard from her again, even 
though I sent her letters.&quot;

&quot;Gosh, that&#39;s rough,&quot; I sighed. &quot;But why would your parents ever be a 
problem?&quot;

&quot;They are what the Americans call &#145;homophobes&#39;, but I just think they do 
not tolerate it. It&#39;s not a matter of fear, just...hate, pure and 
simple. They say it&#39;s horribly wrong, and women should be with men. If 
that were really so, then all the world would be that way. But it&#39;s not, 
is it?&quot;

&quot;Nope, certainly not. You raise a good point, Yukester,&quot; I said, rolling 
over on my side to look at her. &quot;If we were meant to be a heterosexual 
world, we wouldn&#39;t have gay people, just like if people were meant to 
fly, they&#39;d have wings. Um...bad analogy, I know, but you get the idea.&quot; 
She smiled back, and we clasped hands. I kissed her softly and asked how 
on Earth she had finally gotten the guts to reveal her feelings.

&quot;Simple,&quot; she answered. &quot;Parting with Mika carved a great hole in my 
heart, and I swore that no matter what my parents thought, I would not 
be ashamed to profess my feelings the next time I fell in love. And so 
far,&quot; she added with a blush, &quot;I have not been having much success. My 
friends say I try too hard. I just follow my heart. That is not a bad 
thing.&quot;

&quot;...No, it&#39;s not.&quot; I kissed her again. I love you, Mihoshi Kogure. And I 
told her that, without any shame or fear. After all, she said she liked 
my honesty. In return, she smiled and told me that she loved me too.

For one single, magical evening, we had each other in the sweet blossom 
of sex.

We were so careful. We hid it so well outside of the school. We were so 
careful.

But not careful enough.

Mihoshi&#39;s parents found us out&#151;and worse still, they discovered our 
union while we were still in...that union. There&#39;s nothing more 
humiliating than having your lover&#39;s intolerant parents discover you 
wearing nothing but their daughter&#39;s skin. I fought past them, grabbed 
Yuki and my clothes, and made a race for the door. But she thrust me 
away at the last moment, begging me to go, save myself, or some stupid 
hero nonsense like that. I screamed and cursed those fools who dared to 
separate us&#151;but in the end I ran, like a coward, and I went to the only 
person I knew that would understand me and my sorrow. Not mom. Not dad. 
Not even Avelina. Miss Torvald.

Full circle.

.........

After calming her student down a little (a bit of hot tea in a thermos 
and a lot of love will do it), Andeira heard Kula&#39;s story. She knew 
about the semi-secret romance, being Kula&#39;s confidante, and also knew 
that Kogure&#39;s parents were more than against same-sex relationships. But 
she didn&#39;t know they had been discovered, till&#39; just recently, and she 
didn&#39;t know what happened after that. But then again, nobody did; this 
was all recent news.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have run away,&quot; mumbled Nanahara, glowering to herself in 
the corner. &quot;I should have stayed there and helped her. We coulda told 
em&#39;, ya know, that we were in love. We coulda told em&#39; and flung it in 
their faces, and dared them to say anything about it. The two of us 
together, that&#39;s what I mean. But I ran,&quot; she snorted, disgusted at 
herself. &quot;Now she has to face all that nonsense on her own. Damn it...I 
oughta go back there and help her.&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t let you set foot near the house,&quot; Torvald said. &quot;Intolerant 
parents have a way of making the love life of their children 
complicated, especially in this case. I think you did the right thing, 
so beating yourself up over it isn&#39;t going to help.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, don&#39;t say that, Tee!&quot; shouted Kula. &quot;If I had stayed there&#151;&quot;

&quot;They would&#39;ve forced you out anyway. The best thing you can do now is 
stay out of this.&quot;

&quot;What&#151;and let Mihoshi&#39;s parents just move? Ya know, I think that&#39;s what 
they&#39;ll do: they&#39;ll pick their daughter up, move her away, and have her 
home-schooled for the rest of her life. I mean, she can&#39;t go to any 
school now that they know she&#39;s a lesbian! Whatever the case,&quot; she 
murmured, &quot;it&#39;ll be painful. I love her, Tee. I love her more&#39;n I ever 
loved anyone before. She understood me, y&#39;know? And it&#39;s not just that! 
She even liked what other people hated about me! You know: my temper, my 
rash behavior, my bluntness, so on and so forth. She liked all that 
stuff. She didn&#39;t just accept me for who I was&#151;she loved me for who I 
was. And I loved her too, every bit of her.&quot;

She wiped her eyes with her sleeve, not bothering to explain away the 
tears. She was comfortable crying in front of her teacher; there was no 
emotion hidden. Andeira&#39;s motherly instincts wanted to hug Kula again, 
but that alone wouldn&#39;t get anything done. Comfort could only go so 
far&#151;there needed to be action done as well.

&quot;I know you loved each other,&quot; she said, looking her student in the eye. 
&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m going to do everything in my power to keep the two of 
you together.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be the day,&quot; Kula said, chuckling bitterly. &quot;What, you gonna 
walk on over to the Kogure&#39;s house and tell Ma and Pa that it&#39;s okay 
their precious weirdo daughter&#39;s homosexual? They already think she&#39;s 
weird cuz&#39; of the way she acts. This just added more fuel to the fire.&quot;

&quot;Actually, I was thinking of going over there to flex my diplomatic 
muscles,&quot; she replied, surprising Kula a little. &quot;I do speak fluent 
Japanese, so maybe I could reach them. I&#39;m also a teacher to the both of 
you, so I have credibility on my side, plus I have a few other wild 
cards in reserve.&quot;

&quot;Such as?&quot; Andeira gave the young Hawaiian hothead a foxy smile.

&quot;Oh, secret things. Things only a parent could understand.&quot;

&quot;You have a kid?&quot;

&quot;Like I said, secret things. Look. Don&#39;t worry. Just go back home so 
your parents don&#39;t worry about you. I&#39;ll call you if something comes 
up.&quot;

&quot;My parents don&#39;t care about me,&quot; she snorted. &quot;If they had found us 
humping in bed, they wouldn&#39;t give it a second glance. Heh...guess I 
should&#39;ve stayed at home, no? But what can ya do when your girlfriend&#39;s 
sitting on her bed, dressed in that foxy cheerleader outfit, practically 
begging you to&#151;to, uh...well, you know.&quot; Kula was about to say something 
salacious, but even she knew to keep such things under control, whether 
around friends or enemies. And Mrs. Torvald didn&#39;t need to hear about 
&quot;that&quot;.

&quot;Well, go home anyway. And let me handle the Kogures. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve 
faced worse situations. I promise I won&#39;t let you down.&quot; Kula smiled, 
reluctantly but sweetly, and gave the older woman another hug before 
leaving. There was no need to thank her, and even if there was, she 
could never express it, not with a whole library.

.........

Torvald braced herself for everything as she waited for the door to 
open. Preparing for the worst wouldn&#39;t cut it: perhaps the Kogure family 
was not quite as intolerant as the rumors said they were. Maybe she 
might even slide through this without having to play any of her wild 
cards&#151;just a few peaceful words here and there, and the problem would be 
solved. Of course, this probably wouldn&#39;t be the case, but why prepare 
only for the worst when the best was also a possibility?

&quot;Me, being optimistic?&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;Heh, that&#39;s a laugh.&quot; 
She took another breath to be sure, and put on her most polite smile as 
the door opened and a mid-sized, mid-aged Japanese man poked his head 
through.

&quot;May I...help you?&quot; he managed, his English slow. Torvald bowed and, in 
perfect Japanese, replied back.

&quot;Hello, Mr. Kogure! My name is Andeira Torvald, and I&#39;m the foreign 
languages teacher at Stanton Public High School for Girls. Mihoshi is 
one of my students, and it&#39;s my understanding that she&#39;s been in some 
trouble recently. I was hoping I might speak with the family as a whole 
to see if I could placate things.&quot; Mr. Kogure was mildly surprised that 
an American could master his language so well, and at first returned her 
smile with equal length and merriment. But mentioning &quot;Stanton&quot; caused 
him to falter a little, and mentioning Mihoshi&#39;s troubles nearly erased 
it. But no matter what he was, he wasn&#39;t impolite, and asked her to come 
in.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you know my language,&quot; he said, switching back to Japanese. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know English very well, as you&#39;ve heard, and I&#39;m not comfortable 
listening to it either. Please, come, sit.&quot; Andeira took her shoes off 
and joined the man in the den; his wife came in at his bidding, but 
Mihoshi was nowhere to be found. In her room, perhaps?

&quot;I first want to tell you what a delight Mihoshi is,&quot; Torvald said, not 
sure whether she could call her by her nickname in the presence of her 
family. &quot;She&#39;s very helpful and enthusiastic, and keeps most of the 
school in...good spirits. Of course, she&#39;s not without her problems, and 
I have not seen her attempt to tone down her...actions. You know the 
ones I mean?&quot;

&quot;Only too well,&quot; gestured Mr. Kogure. &quot;We&#39;re tired of it ourselves. We 
are glad that Mihoshi embraces our culture, but to this extent? 
Honestly, sometimes I don&#39;t know whether she is really serious, is still 
playing like a child, or has developed a charming insanity.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not dangerous,&quot; added his wife, and everyone agreed on that. &quot;I 
think she simply needs something to guide her, some other activity. 
Cheerleading and kendo are both good, but perhaps it&#39;s her mind that 
needs placating, not her strength.&quot; Andeira nodded, not sure what else 
to add. She pushed Yuki as hard as she could without overwhelming the 
girl, so any other holes would have to be filled by the other teachers. 
Then, Mr. Kogure brought out the main course: he pointed at Torvald and 
stared suddenly.

&quot;You mentioned something about her troubles. What do you know of them?&quot; 
Well, here went nothing. Torvald sat up, looked Mr. Kogure in the eye, 
and spoke calmly, slowly, and graciously.

&quot;I have been informed that she found a relationship the two of you did 
not approve of. I also heard that you took actions to prevent this 
relationship from continuing.&quot;

&quot;Most correct,&quot; grunted Mrs. Kogure, almost growling. &quot;Mihoshi has 
surprised and shamed us with this newest oddity. We thought we could 
just ignore the last one. She did nobody any real harm, except by 
causing us embarrassment. In time we even learned to smile at some of 
it. But this!! This is outrageous! Never before have I imagined my own 
daughter to be like...that!&quot;

&quot;This is not only shocking and humiliating,&quot; added Mr. Kogure, &quot;but it 
goes against everything we believe, everything we know and trust. Are 
you aware of the societal structure in our homeland?&quot;

&quot;Certainly not as well as you two,&quot; admitted Torvald. The answer pleased 
the couple.

&quot;No, I suppose not. But you are aware that we, and many others, 
encourage what is called the &#145;nuclear family&#39;. It must consist of one 
husband, one wife, one child at least&#151;three or more, perhaps&#151;and time 
permitting, a pet for companionship. This is not merely a choice or a 
belief; it is a system, a priority. And as you must know, values may 
change, but priorities do not.&quot;

&quot;I understand completely,&quot; said Andeira. &quot;May I ask you a question?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead.&quot;

&quot;Do you hate your daughter for what she has done, or do you only hate 
the action?&quot;

&quot;We abhor it!&quot; barked Mrs. Kogure. &quot;Up until now, Mihoshi was a good 
child, one whom we both loved. We had high hopes for her and her 
sister.&quot;

Ah, so Yuki has a sister, mused Torvald. Something to think about. But 
back to the subject.

&quot;But then,&quot; sighed Father, &quot;this falls into our lap. What are we to do, 
except move again, where she cannot be influenced by that girl we saw 
her with. It pains us to move&#151;we only just arrived, and we love it 
here&#151;but if we stay, the two will have contact between them. Even now 
our daughter is under house arrest, and is confided to her room except 
when it is time to eat. Tomorrow we will petition for her withdrawal 
from your school.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mean to sound disrespectful,&quot; Torvald said, &quot;but doesn&#39;t that 
sound a little extreme?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; they both said, looking shocked that she should ever suggest such 
a thing. &quot;It does not.&quot;

&quot;Did you talk to your daughter about this?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to talk about? We know what she&#39;ll say. She will only insist 
that she loves this girl, and does not want to be apart from her. 
Children are so foolish sometimes!&quot;

&quot;Mihoshi may be young, but she&#39;s old enough to think for herself. Don&#39;t 
you think she knows what&#39;s best for her?&quot;

&quot;How could she? She&#39;s not even eighteen yet! Kids that age don&#39;t know 
what they want! They&#39;re like a river with too many tributaries, all 
going in multiple directions until you can no longer keep track of it. 
What she needs is guidance. She is too young for independent thought.&quot;

&quot;I disagree.&quot;

&quot;With all due respect, you are only her teacher, and you do not see her 
every day. We do.&quot;

&quot;But surely you must know that kids will act differently in different 
environments. Surely you don&#39;t expect Mihoshi to&#151;&quot;

&quot;Acting differently is what caused this in the first place!&quot; screamed 
Mr. Kogure suddenly, standing up with a jerk. He continued, blasting at 
poor Andeira: &quot;Why would she hide something like this? Why not tell us, 
spare herself the future humiliation, and allows us to change her mind 
before she gets herself in a hole? Or maybe being in a school where only 
women teach has affected her! Perhaps you encouraged her along the way!&quot;

&quot;I did nothing of the sort,&quot; Torvald replied, her voice still even. &quot;I 
only encouraged Mihoshi as a teacher should. What she did with her 
relationships were entirely up to her. And I see no reason to shout.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve agitated me,&quot; he spat, trying his hardest to sit down again. His 
wife seemed a little suppressed, but then she came around and offered a 
more icy palette.

&quot;I know why Mihoshi kept this from us. It&#39;s because she knew we would 
react this way if we found out! That&#39;s why she kept it a secret. And yet 
she dares to defy our wishes, and goes along with this anyway. 
Apparently she is not only foolish, but forgetful as well.&quot;

&quot;I do agree with that,&quot; murmured Torvald throatily. &quot;But your daughter 
also loved this other woman very much&#151;so much that she would fight to 
keep it hidden for as long as she could. Do you know how much she wept 
when you put her in her room&#151;or how badly the other girl must&#39;ve felt?&quot;

&quot;She deserved it; she seduced our own daughter!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s incorrect. Mihoshi might have been like this long 
before either one of you knew about it.&quot;

&quot;And nobody did anything to tell us!&quot;

&quot;Because they knew what would happen! Mihoshi&#39;s a good student and a 
good friend. Nobody wants to uproot her! Why are you even doing this!&quot;

&quot;We already told you!&quot; they both shouted. &quot;Now&#151;excuse us, we have 
nothing else to say. We will move and our daughter will not see that 
other girl again.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; wailed Torvald suddenly. She then pulled out one of her aces, and 
threw herself on the floor in abject humility. &quot;Please, reconsider what 
you&#39;re doing,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I beg of you. Mihoshi is your daughter, 
for God&#39;s sake. Can you not rule her with love, and let her do things on 
her own, instead of dictating everything for her? I beg of you, esteemed 
parents, not to do this. Don&#39;t do this, please, I beg you. Don&#39;t uproot 
her. It will kill her.&quot;

&quot;She should have thought of that before she went to bed with that 
whore!&quot; snapped Mother. Andeira flashed the other woman a rare 
expression of anger.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare speak that way about my students. Especially the ones 
that confide in me their secrets. Yes...I knew about this too,&quot; she 
added, ignoring their harsh stares. &quot;I&#39;ve known about it for a long 
time, and I was happy for them. I was happy for them. In my life, I&#39;ve 
know nothing but sorrow. I&#39;ve been exiled from my own country for an 
accidental discretion I wanted nothing to do with. My husband and my son 
are miles away, and I&#39;ve not heard one word from either of them since 
the incident. One of my students was killed back then, and I was forced 
to come here so I would not further humiliate my family. But even so, I 
can still be happy.&quot;

&quot;Did you have a relationship with another woman?&quot; barked Father. Torvald 
glared.

&quot;I did, but I did not want it. Regardless, it happened. And it happened 
again when I came to the states, so you could say I didn&#39;t learn my 
lesson. Even now, I&#39;m planning on running away so I won&#39;t have to 
confront the ghosts of my past. But if I do run.........then I&#39;ll just 
make more ghosts, I know. I know I have to face everything now. I have 
to stop, turn around, and look at my demons right in the eye. I have to 
find a definition of happiness; I have to make a heaven out of this 
hell, and not just for myself, but for Mihoshi, for people like your 
daughter, and the girl she loves. They need me here. I know that now. 
After speaking with you, I know they need me now more than ever.&quot;

Andeira took a few breaths after being winded from her speech, and 
waited for their reaction. But all they did was walk away, leaving her 
laying there on that floor. She went to pursue them, but they shouted 
back&#151;&quot;Leave! Or we&#39;ll call the police!&quot; Torvald was a tough woman, and 
she stuck up for her students like a mother, but even she knew when to 
back away, and calmly walked out the front door, feeling like she had 
accomplished nothing, save encourage the Kogures to move away.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kula,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I failed you. But I&#39;ll spend the rest 
of my life making it up to you, I swear.&quot;

.........

Andeira hardly ever drank, and when she did, it was hardly anything to 
get excited about. But she went to a nice bar later that evening, and 
had a nice alcoholic beverage to clear (or muddle) her thoughts. She 
only had the one, knowing she would need sobriety for the ride home, but 
that one might&#39;ve been enough. Besides, this now gave her the time to 
think. She had professed, before two total strangers, that she would not 
leave Stanton so long as somebody else needed her. After all the fuss 
she went through, and all the trouble she caused Bernie and the others, 
it took two stubborn Japanese parents to make her realize what was 
important. And she would live up to her word&#151;after all, she owed it to 
Kula, if nobody else.

She finished her drink and sighed, deciding to wait a few minutes just 
in case the alcohol took its time going through her system. The bar was 
colored with rich red velvety wallpaper&#151;it was almost like curtains 
surrounding the room&#151;and the music was sometimes jazz, sometimes 
classical. Everyone dressed up, showered, and shaved for that kind of 
place, and if anyone smelled improperly, it was probably because of the 
nice cigar smoke or the awful cologne/perfume they wore. It was a classy 
place, right up Torvald&#39;s ally&#151;one she didn&#39;t expect to find a familiar 
face in.

&quot;Two martini,&quot; said a familiar accented voice to her right. She glanced 
around and saw Mr. Kogure, of all people. He reached for the martinis, 
and offered one to Torvald, smiling broadly. She declined.

&quot;No thank you, sir,&quot; she spoke, again in his language. &quot;One&#39;s my limit. 
I have to drive home.&quot;

&quot;Nonsense, I&#39;ll call a cab for you! Here, drink, relax! Have a good 
time! I owe it to you for being rude earlier.&quot; She really didn&#39;t want to 
imbibe any further, but neither did she want to appear rude, so she took 
the drink, one sip at a time. He practically guzzled his down, then 
asked for beer.

&quot;What, no sake?&quot; she asked playfully. He scowled, she apologized&#151;then he 
chuckled.

&quot;I deserve a little ribbing. I was most disrespectful to you earlier. 
I&#39;ll buy the drink and hail a cab as an apology. You don&#39;t mind if I sit 
next to you, do you?&quot;

&quot;No, please.&quot; He did so, and took the great big mug of beer in his 
hands, smiling broadly. The man must&#39;ve had an excellent constitution, 
because he downed almost a quarter of the glass without backing down 
once. Then he slapped his hand on the counter, sang &quot;Madadayo!&quot;, and 
chuckled at Torvald. She merely smiled back.

&quot;I like Kurosawa as well. Might I ask why you&#39;re suddenly in a good 
mood?&quot;

&quot;Ehh...I&#39;ve been naughty,&quot; he said with a drunken chuckle. &quot;Actually, 
I&#39;ve been terrible. I thought about what you said and discussed it with 
my inner being. Then I felt like I needed to apologize for my outburst. 
I didn&#39;t know where to look for you, so I called your school and was 
able to contact a few friends of yours who told me where you&#39;d be. You 
certainly do have excellent taste!&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t come here very often,&quot; she admitted. &quot;Mostly when I 
really want to clear my head.&quot;

&quot;Booze will do more than clear your head,&quot; he chuckled, ribbing her. 
Then he got serious again. &quot;I want to say I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve been nothing 
short of an ass, and so has my wife. But you have to understand, Mrs. 
Torvald, the truth behind our intolerance is not close-mindedness. A 
true man, or woman, cannot hate what they cannot understand. For 
example, if I don&#39;t know how a volcano works, it would be foolish of me 
to shake my fist at it when it erupts. Only by understanding the inner 
workings of the volcano may I come to better terms with it. I may even 
respect it. The same goes for my daughter&#39;s condition.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot; asked Torvald, even though she could guess where this was 
going.

&quot;My wife and I are not strangers to same-sex relationships,&quot; he sighed, 
becoming woeful all of a sudden. &quot;For example, when I was Mihoshi&#39;s age, 
I fell in love with another boy. I thought I was going to live with this 
young man for the rest of my life. His parents were not as intellectual 
as we are, I humbly say, and they hated him for what he did, and they 
hated me. In the end, he chose them over me, and I was crushed. A few 
years later, I met the woman who would become my wife, and the two of us 
gradually fell in love. But she had her share of heartache as well.&quot;

&quot;She was in love with another woman?&quot; Torvald guessed. He sighed.

&quot;I think so. I really don&#39;t know all the details. She tells me she did, 
and she cries every time it&#39;s mentioned. &#145;For Mihoshi&#39;, she said, &#145;we 
cannot allow her to experience this. We must hate same-sex relationships 
because they&#39;ve devastated us both in the past.&#39; I agreed with her. You 
must understand, Mrs. Torvald. We love our daughter very much, and we 
want to spare her as much pain as possible. We know we can&#39;t shield her 
from every arrow that grazes by, but we want to do what we can. This is 
just one of our methods.&quot; He stopped talking then, and attended to his 
beer.

So, this was the whole truth, then. Andeira knew it all now.

And, not for the last time, she forced herself to wonder why people did 
this.

Was it really genetic? Or was it a choice? If it was a choice, why 
choose pain? If it was genetic, why not fight it?

There must be some greater meaning behind the whole puzzle. She was just 
not wise enough to decipher it.

&quot;Will you really go through with the whole thing?&quot; she asked quietly. He 
sighed.

&quot;Better to give our daughter a lash across the back than stand witness 
as her heart is torn in two.&quot;

&quot;But you do realize that you&#39;ll be breaking her heart even if you do 
move.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; he moaned, covering his head in agony. &quot;It&#39;s so hard for all 
of us. But it&#39;s better for Mihoshi this way. We know it is.&quot;

&quot;Is it really?&quot; she whispered. &quot;What would happen if you didn&#39;t move? Or 
else, what will happen in the future if, say, a man breaks her heart?&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t know,&quot; he moaned, &quot;I just don&#39;t know!&quot;

&quot;That woman will face heartbreak no matter where she goes,&quot; murmured 
Torvald, now talking about Yuki and herself. &quot;No matter where she runs 
off to, there will be ghosts to face. She can&#39;t just keep running; 
otherwise, she will never find the strength to fight back. But if you 
stay, where you love it and your daughter loves it, she can be given the 
chance. You all can.&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t, we can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t leave,&quot; she told him, placing her hand on his shoulder. &quot;Before 
all this happened, I was really going to leave Stanton for good&#151;put my 
back to my problems and go somewhere else, somewhere where nobody would 
know my name. But talking to you has made me realize that I&#39;ll just face 
more problems along the way, no matter what. And I can&#39;t run forever. So 
I&#39;m going to stop, turn around, and look my problems right in the eye. 
&#145;I am Andeira Torvald,&#39; I&#39;ll say, &#145;and I am no longer afraid of you&#39;. 
I&#39;ll stay behind, and I will do everything in my power to help 
Mihoshi&#151;and to help the two of you&#151;with every crisis that comes up. I&#39;ll 
stay as long as it takes.&quot;

For a long, long, long time, Mr. Kogure said nothing; he just kept 
rubbing his face. He finally released himself, drank a few sips, then 
turned to look at Andeira. &quot;You are, without a doubt, the strongest 
person I have met. You have more guts than anyone I know, including 
myself. I was fearful for my daughter, but now that I know you will be 
here to help her...perhaps the Kogure family can settle down and find 
roots here. But there is still the matter of this other girl. I 
wonder...is she the kind who will break Mihoshi&#39;s heart?&quot;

&quot;For all I know, Kula is a great, sweet, strong woman, and she loves 
Mihoshi for who she is. She even likes her oddities.&quot;

&quot;That such a love could exist,&quot; he sighed, staring into his golden 
drink. &quot;That anyone could find happiness with what our daughter does. A 
person like that could never break her heart.&quot; He then finished his 
drink, and the smile returned. &quot;It is good that we spoke, Mrs. Torvald. 
Sometimes the ass needs a gentle word before it can move on.&quot;

&quot;Indeed it does,&quot; she said. &quot;And sometimes it needs to be reminded of 
what it could leave behind if it runs off. Here&#39;s to two abominable 
asses and the hopes that they learn from their ways.&quot; They clinked their 
glasses together, and Mr. Kogure ordered one more round for the both of 
them. Luckily, Andeira&#39;s intoxication was almost gone by that point, so 
she could tolerate one more drink before she hit the road.

I got off lucky, she reasoned on the cab ride home. If the Kogure family 
had been any different, Mihoshi and Kula would both be devastated. I&#39;m 
just glad they have some wisdom in their heads. More than I do, anyway. 
So, I guess I kept true to my word to Kula after all, but Bernie and the 
others are going to have a field day when I tell them of my decision. 
(Sigh), I&#39;ll never hear the end of it!

.........

The next day, Kula walked to school like she was carrying the rock of 
Gibraltar on her back. Yuki was probably gone by now, and Mrs. T, bless 
her, would be moaning and groaning about how she failed her. It wasn&#39;t 
Tee&#39;s fault&#151;Japanese people could be so stubborn sometimes, and she knew 
that from being raised by one. She would miss Yuki horribly, and might 
never stop mourning her absence. To think, the one person who honestly 
loved her for who she was, taken away by bigoted parents! Such was the 
fate of many couples, but why did it have to happen to her?! She knew 
she had done bad things in her life, but nothing this dire!

As she absently trudged down the hallways to her first class, she 
thought she heard her name being called. Probably some idiot out for a 
prank. But there it was again, a sweet song-maiden&#39;s melody, Kula! She 
turned around&#151;be still, my beating heart!&#151;and beheld the snowy-haired 
samurai she believed lost forever. The smile she had on was greater than 
a mountain of diamonds.

&quot;...Yuki?&quot; she dared hope. The other girl nodded, and the two ran 
towards each other, their hearts drawing in for a wonderful collision. A 
few doors down, watching the reunion with a quiet smile, was the one 
responsible for making such a dream possible. She was merely content to 
observe; there would be plenty of time later to celebrate. After all, 
she was here to stay.
