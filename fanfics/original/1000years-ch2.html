<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I have the feeling that Susanou no Mikoto must be conspiring
against me. I’m serious, honestly! Why else would they sky stay ominously clouded
for three days in a row, I ask you? And just exactly what is <i>wrong</i> with
the rain anyway? Why doesn’t it just pour down once and get it over with? The
way it keeps dripping for every half an hour or so and then stops just to begin
again ten minutes later is maddening, really! Thanks to this, I have two
basketfuls of wet clothes sitting there and unable to do a thing about them. Considering
how modest my wardrobe is, if this continues, I may just run out of clothes….
What am I going to do?! No, Nikki-chan, I’m definitely <i>NOT</i> wearing
Koto-chan’s! Sure, her size and mine are roughly the same, although she’s
fuller in the chest, not to mention that her clothes smell really nice in the
same way she herself does, and that I was reminded of the feel of her silky
skin against mine every time I touched the fabric….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>What are you trying to make me say, Nikki-chan you pervert
diary!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Who Koto-chan is? Ah, that’s the nickname I gave the
Priestess Fuyuu Kotonoha a couple of months after she took me in as her
assistant. I called her Fuyuu-san whenever I spoke to her in the beginning,
though. As to why the change in the way I addressed her…. Well, it’s a long
story. I better pick up where I left off yesterday first, I think.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Once I had agreed to Kotonoha’s request, she told me that
what she required from an assistant was by no means onerous.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You are to open all the mails addressed to<i> Furisame Jinja
</i>and reply to them in a timely fashion,” she said. “You are to keep a
planner for all the events we hold every year and remind me of what to do in
preparation for them. Of course, your duties also include serving teas and
refreshments to the petitioners who come to the <i>Shrine</i>, helping out
during the festivals, and several other things that should be easy for a
servant.” I nodded along as she spoke, smiling slightly at amount of work I
must perform in her service, thinking it’d be a piece of cake. What was that,
Nikki-chan? You don’t believe me? Well, excuse me! I did grow up as a little
pampered, spoiled girl but for I had been working all kind of chores for other
people before coming to Unomichi, you know.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Other than that, I fear there is nothing else that can keep
boredom away from you, Amano-san,” the raven-haired girl concluded with a
smile. “Of course, there shall be days in which you find yourself overwhelmed
by your job, but there shall also be ones in which the only thing you do more
often than not is watching the sun travel across the sky.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I think I’ll be okay,” I said. What I actually meant by that
was <i>‘I think I’ll be too busy trying to come up with a way to get Sennen no
Inori for Kugimiya Karasu to be bored.’</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Very well.” Kotonoha chuckled softly and turned toward the
Mayor. “Now that is settled, we will take our leave, Shichou-san.” Sadamoto
Shun'ichi gave his assent with a bright smile on his lips. Nothing could have
pleased the man more now that I would be on my way to <i>Furisame Jinja</i> and
let him be.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Where are we going?” I tugged at the sleeve of her white
robe as she prepared to rise to her feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I think to the clothing shop first, Amano-san.” Kotonoha
gave her lips a thoughtful tap. “You came to Unomichi empty-handed. It would be
troublesome if you ran out of clothes. Then of course you will accompany me to
your new home, <i>Furisame Jinja</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The merchant managing the clothing store, a widow named
Yamazaki Mai who still looked quite lovely even in her forties, was so eager to
please the Priestess that she decided that she wouldn’t take even a coin for
all the clothes – newly woven! – she gave me. It turned out that Fuyuu Kotonoha
cured her late husband’s sickness when all the doctors in Unomichi and other
neighboring towns threw up their hands and said she should consider buying him
a coffin. The man broke his neck falling down the stair three months later, but
Yamazaki Mai was eternally grateful to my employer nonetheless.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On the way to the <i>Jinja </i>afterwards, I got time to
think about a couple of things. First, I realized how was it that Fuyuu
Kotonoha didn’t burn me to a crisp in our first encounter the way she did the
demon Akiba. It was rather simple. She didn’t because she couldn’t afford to.
We were in the town square then, so we were surrounded by houses and shops. Spells
were all well if they hit the target, of course. But if they missed and struck
one of the buildings, there was no guarantee the people inside would survive.
Such was the reason why she chose to wield <i>Sennen no Inori</i> against me.
Or so I believe it was.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The second thing I thought of was Akiba’s attitude toward me.
I was under no false illusion when I sensed that Akiba hated me. He did, until
the bitter end. I believe he knew the risk of chasing me to Unomichi, where the
Priestess was. <i>Death</i>. Luck had been the only thing that saved me from
being killed by Fuyuu Kotonoha. Luck deserted Akiba when she destroyed him. He
was simply another pawn moved by Kugimiya Karasu’s hand, an expendable one at
that. He, too, got the short end of the stick. He either disobeyed Karasu and
died a painful death, or faced the Priestess for a chance of survival. His
situation and mine were more alike than I had thought. At that time, I only
hoped I wouldn’t end up like him. Yet, even now, after all the time I spent
with Kotonoha, I still <i>do</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I think I’m sidetracking. Sorry, ne. let me get back to the
point.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was quite a walk from the merchant’s shop to <i>Furisame
Jinja</i>. Kotonoha and I had to go all the way through the Main Street of
Unomichi to reach the Northern Gate, which led to a thick forest named Kagemori
where trees were woven in a labyrinthine pattern. As we ventured deeper,
treading upon roads that seemed to change direction haphazardly and climbing on
slopes that were sometimes too steep, the light from the sun grew so dim we
could only see a few yards ahead. Yet, no matter how treacherous the ground
beneath our feet became, no matter how the dead silence, punctuated by our soft
footfalls, shattered my courage, Kotonoha refused to be fazed. Face calm and
collected, she glided ahead in an even pace. Sometimes she stopped and waited
for me, sometimes she slowed down, but once every often she would turn her head
and look at me with an expression that reminded me of my old neighbor’s
daughter, who was overjoyed when her parents gave her the kimono she had nagged
them to buy her for one whole month.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Then the forest finally gave way to a large clearing, where I
found the tall red-lacquered Torii Archway marking the territory of <i>the
Shrine of the Falling Rain</i>. A short walk brought me the sight of the Shrine’s
Main Gate, a pair of rectangular doors under a gable-roofed arch that towered
over the gray brick walls surrounding <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. With a small push
of her hand, Fuyuu Kotonoha opened the doors and showed me what lay beyond
them. “Welcome to your new home, Amano-san,” she said, smiling gently at me. I
didn’t feel welcomed at all, knowing that stepping into the <i>Jinja</i> was
the same as stepping into a trap. Little did I know that soon, it would no
longer feel like one.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The first thing that a visitor would see once they walked
past the Main Gate was the <i>temizuya, </i>the Purification Font, which was
simply a stone basin filled with water under a roof supported by wooden beams.
The Priestess informed me that this would be the place where people who arrived
at the Shrine would purify their hands and mouths and rid themselves of the
impure things they had accumulated before they came into the presence of
Susanou no Mikoto the God of Storms. Of course, I had to do it too.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> Fuyuu Kotonoha, as graceful as ever, handed me a long bamboo
ladle she named <i>hishaku</i>, which was attached at one end with a <i>go</i>
cup half the size of my hand. After I had received the thing from her, I dipped
it into the stone basin, filled it with water, and then proceeded to purify
myself. First I rinsed my left hand, then my right, then finally my mouth with
the water. Nikki-chan, I was laughing in my head the whole time. Isn’t it
ironic that I, one who is viewed as an abomination and filth in both humans and
demons’ eyes, had to cleanse myself before coming in contact with a God? You
know ne; I’ve always wanted to learn what Susanou no Mikoto thinks about having
a half-breed living next door. Don’t suppose he’s pleased, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Anyway, the main precinct of <i>Furisame Jinja</i> is
organized into two sections on either side of an oval pond probably knee-deep.
On the left is the Residential Area, comprised of the spacious living quarters,
the kitchen, and the restrooms. On the right is of course the Shrine Complex
which is formed by four separate structures – the Hall of Worship, the Hall of
Sacred Dance, the Hall of Offerings, and the Inner Sanctuary – one linked to next
by a gable-roofed wooden portico that’s a few inches off the ground. One
notable thing, all four of them form something that looked like a dipper around
the pond. There are several <i>touro</i>, stone lanterns, placed around the
Shrine, too, so when they’re lit up at night, they provide illumination in the
dark.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>After having given me a tour around <i>Furisame Jinja</i>,
Fuyuu Kotonoha took me to the living quarters. Mine was a large tatami room
that already had what I could possibly need. As you already knew, Nikki-chan,
Kotonoha’s room was right next door. At first, I was rather nervous about
having someone who might kill me should she learn my secret living so close.
After a while, well….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>From that point onward, my life with Fuyuu Kotonoha began. I
did what she expected from an assistant while being mindful of my behaviors,
fully aware that my chance of survival depended on how well I acted. I kept my
distance from her as a result, trying to talk to her as little as I could lest
I accidentally let slip something that could bring about my demise. Kotonoha,
appearing quite aloof in her demeanor the way she always was, made my life even
easier. She mostly stayed in her room and rarely spoke a word while I spent
most of my time sniffing around <i>Furisame Jinja</i> in the hope of getting
Kugimiya Karasu what he wanted so that both he and the Priestess would leave me
be. Cool disinterest seemed to reign between us the way we minded our own
business then. We were a little more than strangers to each other around that time,
I suppose. And of course, my apprehension toward Kotonoha only made it even less
likely for us to become something more.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Two months later, an unexpected incident changed our
relationship forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It happened in a cold night in the eighth month of the year,
when Kotonoha and I were visiting Yamazaki Mai in Unomichi. The Priestess was
invited to join the merchant’s family in celebration of her daughter’s
twentieth birthday. I wouldn’t have gone with Kotonoha to town, actually, had I
not been practically dragged there by the wrist despite my protest. Nikki-chan,
you should have seen her that night. She seemed almost <i>afraid</i> to go by
herself, which was something one could not associate with Fuyuu Kotonoha, the
slayer of demons. It turned out that she <i>was</i>!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It started out quite fine. Yamazaki Mai greeted the raven-haired
girl warmly at her doorstep, slightly surprised upon noticing me standing
behind her. Any fool could see that Kotonoha was the only one to whom the
invitation was extended. The merchant was still very nice, though, for she
immediately acted as though she did want me to come.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Once we had settled down in the living room, Yamazaki Mai introduced
me to her whole family. She had three children, her only son being the eldest.
His name’s Koutarou, a government official working in the Colonization Office.
He was twenty-five, and handsome to boot. According to his mother, he’s so
popular around town that girls who came after him in swarms had to be chased
away from his house with a stick. Her second child was a pretty girl called
Shizuka, who spent the better part of her time helping her mother in the shop.
Her youngest daughter, the ten-year-old Miyuki, was attending the local school.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Five minutes after meeting them, I realized what bothered
Kotonoha so much she barely spoke a word to the Yamazaki family except the
congratulation on Shizuka’s birthday. You know ne, Nikki-chan, every single
member of the Yamazaki people absolutely <i>adored</i> the raven-haired girl.
The mom, driven by gratitude, saw the Priestess as her own daughter while her
children vied for Kotonoha’s attention and love. Well, there was no doubt Miyuki
thought of the Priestess as a second sister the way the little girl kept
tugging at the older’s sleeves and hanging onto her neck, calling her “<i>Koto-nee-chan</i>”…
but her brother and sister were a <i>different</i> story altogether.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, I admit that I’m a rather dimwitted girl. I have
always been slower than people my age but even <i>I</i> could tell at a glance
that Miyuki’s brother and sister were both interested in Fuyuu Kotonoha <i>romantically</i>.
Why else would Yamazaki Koutarou keep glancing at the girl and commenting on
how gorgeous she always looked? Why else would Yamazaki Shizuka keep sticking
to Kotonoha’s side and try to take advantage of every occasion to link arms with
her or touch her hand? And why else would they look at me with envy blazing in
their dark, calculating eyes? They amused me a lot.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>We gathered around a circular table in the dining room,
Kotonoha herself flanked by Koutarou and Shizuka while Miyuki and I sat on
either side of the little girl’s mother. The whole thing was extremely comical;
I have to tell you that. Koutarou and Shizuka appeared to be participating in a
race to see which one could feed more food to the Priestess. From the way they
acted, they obviously believed that Kotonoha was incapable of using the
chopsticks in her hand. Yamazaki Mai, who had gulped down quite a few cups of <i>sake</i>,
merely nodded at the siblings in a very encouraging manner. The merchant, face
red as the content of a watermelon, didn’t seem to <i>register</i> what was
going on. The raven-haired girl, on the other hand, <i>did</i>, which was why
she appeared decidedly ill.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>By that time, I already realized the reason why Kotonoha
dragged me there. The girl knew all too well that Koutarou and Shizuka would be
all over her the moment she stepped past the door. She had already foreseen
that they would never give her a moment’s peace. The Priestess brought me along
because she hoped the presence of a stranger would somehow hold the Yamazaki
siblings back. It didn’t. If anything, they seemed even more fired up and
engrossed in trying to win Kotonoha over. I suppose that was because they
thought someone else had entered the competition. Their little sister, Miyuki, on
the other hand, caused little problem for she went to bed soon after the party
started.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My amusement hit its peak when the merchant announced that
Fuyuu Kotonoha and I were going to stay for the night due to the <i>“obvious”</i>
reason that a girl like <i>her</i> should not cross the forest so late to
return to <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. Kotonoha protested, of course, but her efforts
were in vain, as Yamazaki Mai was too drunk to listen to reason. The Priestess
was devastated and then became horrified at the sudden delighted glow
encompassing the face of Yamazaki Shizuka, who began to fill the raven-haired
girl’s <i>sake</i> cup to the rim. I’d say that the merchant’s daughter was
planning to knock Kotonoha senseless with the rice wine, carry her to bed, and
then have her ways with her. Me? I simply smirked. What? She nearly killed me
once, in case you’ve forgotten, Nikki-chan! It’s only fair that I enjoyed her misery.
Besides, I didn’t think so fondly of her then the way I do now….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Anyways… back to the party. Well, life had its ups and downs.
My ups were seeing Fuyuu Kotonoha being <i>mauled</i> by the Yamazaki siblings.
My downs were what came as a result. Just when the raven-haired girl seemed to
be on the verge of breaking for the door, the merchant decided that it was time
for bed. One problem, there were no spare rooms. Well, they used to have one on
the second floor, where Kotonoha stayed whenever she visited the Yamazaki, but
it was under repair at the moment. From what, the merchant didn’t say. Oh how
Kotonoha had freaked out upon hearing that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, well,” Yamazaki Mai glanced at the Priestess and me. “Kotonoha-sama,
would you share Shizuka’s room? I think Amano-san would not mind staying in
mine for the night.” Kotonoha’s face paled to the shade of a blank sheet of
paper. She also quivered as if struck, to which I almost laughed aloud. “Now,
now, Shizuka, go grab a spare futon and put it in your room for Kotonoha-sama,
would you?” From the birthday girl’s expression, she would be much happier
should she be able to share the same futon with the Priestess… and the latter
knew it. Horror crept across her face. Of course, there was no guarantee that
Yamazaki Shizuka would not jump her in the middle of the night… or the moment
they drew the door shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Suddenly, determination lit Fuyuu Kotonoha’s obsidian eyes.
She spoke firmly, “I will be very grateful if I am allowed to stay with my
assistant, Mai-san.” My amusement suffered from a fatal blow and died the
moment I heard her say that. Deafening silence hung in the dining room.
Everyone was looking at the Priestess, appearing utterly confused.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“But I have so many things to talk to you about,
Kotonoha-sama,” Shizuka insisted. “Amano-san lives with you in <i>Furisame
Jinja</i>, she can survive one night without you, I’m sure.” She glared at me
afterwards. No doubt the birthday girl would fetch a knife and lunge at me should
I choose to say otherwise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She can, but I cannot,” Kotonoha said dryly, “if I had to
spend the night away from her.” The glance she sent my way left no uncertainty
what she could have meant. My eyes went as wide as they could while those of
the Yamazaki family looked ready to jump out of their sockets. Shizuka in
particular grunted as though she had been struck by a hammer across her chest.
I thought I should say something, but the shock had stilled my tongue.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh,” the merchant managed. Her mouth only worked soundlessly
after that. In the end, she snapped it shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Kotonoha-sama, is Amano-san your…” Yamazaki Shizuka sounded
strangled. “… your….”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes, she is my girlfriend.” Fuyuu Kotonoha nodded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Hey, wait just a minute,” I blurted. “I don’t remember being
your….” I stopped abruptly, for Kotonoha’s obsidian eyes had already swiveled
to meet mine. <i>‘Please, Amano-san, just go along with it,’</i> the
raven-haired girl’s voice said pleadingly in my head, <i>‘I beg of you.’ </i>I
closed my own mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“We do not have to hide it here, <i>Hikari-san</i>,” Kotonoha
smiled tenderly at me. “These people are like my family.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Right…” I answered curtly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“That’s… interesting,” Yamazaki Koutarou commented while
tapping his lips thoughtfully. He was the least fazed by the news, I think. “Seeing
that you’ve been… together for barely a couple of months.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“So?” Fuyuu Kotonoha rose to her feet and settled down at my
side. Then she put her hand atop mine, squeezing it in a very loving manner. “Many
things can happen in two months.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A fine joke to play on <i>my</i> birthday, Kotonoha-sama.”
Yamazaki Shizuka narrowed her eyes at the Priestess, then at me, voice reeking
of disbelief. I seriously doubt the girl bought Kotonoha’s lie, or was even
willing to. “You can’t be serious.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I assure you that I am,” Kotonoha replied coolly. “In fact,
I can even prove it.” I was stunned, for I had no idea how the Priestess would
prove one of the most outrageous lies I ever heard. I learned just exactly what
she planned the very moment she slipped an arm around my waist and placed her
hand firmly against my back, pulling me closer. Her lovely face was but an inch
away from mine as she used her vacant hand to cup my chin gently and lift it
up.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i>‘I am terribly sorry for this, Amano-san. Please forgive
me,’ </i>a message arrived in my head. Her lips, soft, warm, and sweetened by
the <i>sake</i>, engulfed mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My heart stopped beating. My whole body went rigid in shock.
My face felt like a pot boiling atop a stove, and a voice somewhere at the back
of my head was screaming. It took a lot of effort to make my body still and not
push the raven-haired girl off of me. It couldn’t have been more than a few
seconds, yet when Fuyuu Kotonoha finally drew her lips away, it was as if a
century had passed. I wanted to slap her.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh… okay,” Yamazaki Mai said faintly. Koutarou’s face was
painted with utmost disappointment while his sister’s contorted in rage. “Shizuka…
get your room ready for Amano-san and Kotonoha-sama. You’re sleeping in mine. Koutarou,
you help me clean up the dishes.” The birthday girl stalked out of the dining
room, face a thunderhead.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The merchant turned to the Priestess and said with a shaky
smile, “Please make yourself at home, Kotonoha-sama, and have a nice sleep. I
will see you at breakfast tomorrow. And of course, you too, Amano-san.” So the
woman said but the look she gave me was definitely murderous. From that point
onward, I decided that I would never step into the Yamazaki household ever
again. If I do, a certain <i>someone, </i>or maybe <i>two</i>, will be waiting
with a knife.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Fuyuu Kotonoha gave an incline of her head as she stood up
again, drawing me along. She never let go of my hand even when we climbed the
stair to the second floor, the first room on the right-hand side of which belonged
to Yamazaki Shizuka. She held it even more firmly when we found the birthday
girl standing inside, looming over two futon straightened neatly upon the
tatami mats. In the silvery moonlight spilling in from the opened window, the
merchant’s daughter appeared death personified. Kotonoha merely looked at the
girl calmly, then said, “Thank you, Shizuka-san.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“My pleasure, Kotonoha-sama,” the girl said, voice strained,
eyes’ corners tight, and hands clenched into fists. “Well then, please excuse
me. Have a good night.” She left, slamming the shoji door behind her with a
loud crack. Angry footsteps faded into the distance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Amano-san,” Fuyuu Kotonoha said with a deep sigh as she
settled on her knees in the <i>seiza</i> fashion. “I have no excuse, but I beg
for your forgiveness.” She bowed so deeply toward me that her forehead touched
the tatami mat. Her voice was low lest it carry to the wrong ear, but I could
sense the sincerity of the apology. The guilt was tormenting her. Having
realized that, my irritation toward her decreased at least by three-fourths, if
not all. I’m just a soft-hearted girl after all.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Cheap to just say sorry, you know,” I muttered darkly and
sat down next to her, my back leaning against the wall, arms hugging my knees.
“It’s my first kiss.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“If I know how to compensate to you, I would,” the
raven-haired girl said frantically. “I... I... did not know what to do at that
time. I was… only trying desperately to find a way to avoid staying in the same
room with Shizuka-san.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She scared you, didn’t she?” I said, peering at the
Priestess in sheer curiosity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You have no idea how frightening that girl is.” Kotonoha sighed
again, this time much more deeply. “Once she came to <i>Furisame Jinja</i> on
her own, insisting that she was possessed by a demon and demanding that I
perform an exorcism on her. Before I knew it, she had stripped herself bare in
front of me and refused to put the clothes back on even after I had explained
that no exorcism rituals require nakedness.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Eh?” I laughed aloud. “What did you do?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I sent a dove carrying a message to her mother and brother
to pick her up,” Kotonoha replied. “It had been the longest hour of my life
waiting for them to show up in the <i>Jinja</i> while trying with all my might
to fend her off.” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She really likes you, so it’s kinda inevitable that she
wants you, don’t you think?” I pointed out, all the while trying to suppress
another burst of laughter. I barely succeeded.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Just so you know, Amano-san,” Kotonoha muttered. “I do not <i>like</i>
her romantically, much less <i>want</i> her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, tell her that!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I did! On numerous occasions!” the raven-haired girl
clutched her forehead with her hand and exclaimed in a frustrated tone. “She pretended
that she did not hear me <i>every single time</i>. It was like talking to a
brick wall, but one that can move around and hell-bent on becoming my lover.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Surely you can complain to her mom?” I asked, still deeply
amused by the raven-haired girl’s tale. Who could have thought that someone
like <i>her</i> could be chased after by another so insidiously?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You seriously do not believe I have not tried that now do
you?” the Priestess said wryly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“If you had, how come Mai-san did nothing but watch her
daughter pinning herself to your skirt?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Shizuka-san got her mother’s approval from the beginning;
that is why.” Kotonoha gave a small shake of her head and a mirthless laughter.
Despair filled her melodious voice. “When the merchant said the guestroom was
under repair, she was lying. She only wanted to stuff me in her daughter’s bed.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“EH?” I blinked at her in shock. “Really?!” You see,
Nikki-chan, I only thought that the widowed woman was mad at me because I stole
Kotonoha away from her <i>son</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes.” The raven-haired girl nodded in exasperation. “She is
so grateful toward me that nothing will please her more than me becoming an <i>official</i>
member of her family. That means she would not mind if I ended up being <i>either</i>
Koutarou-san or Shizuka-san’s lover. And of course, it does not sit well with
her at all now that I have announced you to be my romantic interest. I would be
careful around the Yamazaki were I you, Amano-san.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh, thanks for the advice, Fuyuu-san, I haven’t noticed,” I
said and stuck out my tongue at the raven-haired girl. To my astonishment, she blushed,
and I found myself staring unblinkingly at her sheepish face. Honest to the
heavens above, Nikki-chan, nothing in this whole wide world could have looked
more adorable than the girl that was sitting by my side. Her downcast obsidian
eyes and her reddening cheeks only emphasized her striking beauty. With her
sitting there, embarrassed, the majestic silver moon on high appeared at best a
glowing rock, and the flickering candle flame on the table at the corner might
as well never exist.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“My most sincere apologies to you, Amano-san,” Fuyuu Kotonoha
muttered. “I have given you nothing but troubles.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“This is really unlike you, you know,” I commented.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh?” She blinked, surprise evident on her stunning face.
“How so?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s just that I’ve only seen <i>you</i> pushing people
around during the two months I lived with you, not the opposite,” I explained.
“The townsfolk always did what you wanted them to. Those who refused oftentimes
ended up obeying anyway. So you see, it’s kinda hard to imagine that you’re
powerless against the Yamazaki… um… mob.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It would seem that I appear a bully in your eyes,
Amano-san,” she said while give me a sidelong glance, the corners of her small,
pretty lips curving upward in a little smile.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I thought you are,” I told her frankly, which made the smile
slid off Kotonoha’s face and her complexion darken considerably. The
raven-haired girl was red all the way to her ears. Sitting so close to her in
that room, I could almost feel the heat being given off. She only appeared lovelier.
Dear Nikki-chan, during the first sixteen years of my life, I never once
imagined how one day I would find myself mesmerized by the sight of a beautiful
girl, one who had attempted to kill me at that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Anyways.” Kotonoha coughed delicately into her small hand.
“You are right. In front of the Yamazaki, I do not act the way I usually would.
You see, most people in Unomichi see me as a <i>useful</i> sword to slay the
demons inhabiting this land. I have to look strong to them, or they would lose
their faith in <i>Furisame Jinja</i>.” She paused for a second and then
continued, “The merchant’s family, on the other hand, simply treats me as a
fellow human being. With them, I can be myself and let go of the façade I have
been putting up. To Yamazaki Mai-san, I am a girl she means to see married to
her son, or romantically involved with her daughter. To Shizuka-san and
Koutarou-san, I am first among equals… and a prey. My status as a Priestess and
all my powers might as well count for naught.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I bet you sometimes wished that you never saved the
merchant’s husband, ne?” I gave a start. “I’m sorry!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Do not be,” she told me, voice taut with guilt and shame. “I
<i>did</i>.” She then looked down in embarrassment and took up a serious study
of the tatami mat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Guess being stalked does that to you.” I laughed nervously.
Fuyuu Kotonoha only kept silent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I think it is time for bed,” Kotonoha decided finally. “I
wish to leave as early as possible tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I don’t understand.” I looked at the raven-haired girl
quizzically. “You already told Shizuka-san that I was your lover. You even
kissed me to prove your point.” Color once again flared in the other girl’s
smooth cheeks. “There’s no reason you should be afraid of her now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You do not know Shizuka-san well enough, Amano-san,”
Kotonoha muttered. “I lied only because I did not want to become her… toy
tonight. That was <i>it</i>. Dogs would climb trees and cats would swim before
she gives up. <i>If then</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Tough to be you,” I said, smiling, and tried to stand up. I
failed. Halfway rising to my feet, I tripped over the hem of my yukata and fell
down. Fortunately, Kotonoha was there to catch me. For reasons incomprehensible,
I found myself kneeling between her legs, cuddled in her tight embrace, hands
placed on her full bosom, waist encircled by her firm arms, and face inches
from hers, that of the most gorgeous girl in the world. She was soft. She was
warm. And for the first time I ever, I realized that she smelled faintly of the
same fragrance on the handkerchief she lent me during our first official
meeting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You know, I can understand why Yamazaki Shizuka’s so
obsessed with you,” I said quietly, my hands rising up to touch her smooth,
silky cheeks. I swear to the Gods of Heaven I didn’t even know why I did that. “Look
at you. You’re so… beautiful.” She blushed furiously; her skin seemed to burn
against mine. “Anyone would kill to fall into your arms. Anyone would kill to receive
your kiss. And they would kill <i>me</i> if they learned you had given me both.”
I giggled nervously, meanwhile wondering in my head what in goodness’s name I
could be blabbering about. I sounded almost like a flirt!</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ah…. Thank you.” Fuyuu Kotonoha swallowed audibly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“So, who’s the person that was lucky enough to have claimed
your first kiss?” I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You,” came the hesitant answer from Kotonoha’s delicate
mouth. No thunder could have been louder than that one single word, and no
revelation could have been more shocking, I can tell you that, Nikki-chan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I guess that made us even, then,” I said, smiling weakly.
Only then did I become terribly conscious of the fact that she was <i>still</i>
embracing me, and that I was <i>still</i> touching her cheeks. A fraction of an
inch separated the tips of our noses, and practically none between our bodies.
Somehow, without me noticing, I had leaned in close enough to take in every of
her fragrant breaths, close enough to feel her heart race. Although I was
suffering from a sudden blow of embarrassment, I neither could move nor wanted
to move. The only wish in my heart at that moment, mysteriously, was to drown
myself forever in the obsidian pools of light that were her eyes. Strangely
enough, Kotonoha herself didn’t seem wanting to shove me off of her either. She
merely held me and studied my face. The situation somehow managed to be
awkwardly embarrassing and utterly comfortable at the same time.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Actually, it was <i>so</i> comfortable that I never noticed
Yamazaki Shizuka opening the door and stepping in to our – her – room. Fuyuu
Kotonoha did, for she didn’t give a surprised squeak and hastily scramble away
the way I did when Shizuka spoke practically on top of us, “I brought you clean
yukata, Kotonoha-sama, Amano-san.” My name was invested with so much scorn and
hate anyone could have thought that I had killed someone in her family. I guess
her face was absolutely terrifying then, too, but there was no way I could have
known, for I was avoiding looking at either one of them.</p>

each other goodnight before we slipped into the futons. Lying on my side,
beneath the warm and thick blanket, my back facing her, I drifted off to the
land of sensuous dreams… but not before I spent a good hour or so hearing my
heart going wild in my chest. It beat so strongly it was almost painful, and every
part of my skin that had come into contact with the raven-haired girl was as
hot as any roaring flame. It was open wonder how I could have fallen asleep.</p>

with the merchant and her eldest daughter – Miyuki was still snoozing cozily in
her bed and Koutarou had already headed to the Colonization Office – seeing us
off. Well… seeing Kotonoha off, not me. They still looked at me the way hunting
hounds would a fox. Had the girl not been there, I would have been kicked off
their house long since.</p>

nothing had ever happened, and Kotonoha never mentioned the lover’s act again.
She was as icy and aloof as she ever was before we went to Yamazaki Shizuka’s
birthday party. She would stay in her room like always, she wouldn’t speak to
me unless she needed me to run an errand for her, and she wouldn’t look at me
more than five seconds even when handing out instructions. To sum it up, we
were again strangers who happened to live beneath the same roof.</p>

of the ordinary, just like I used to, yet I couldn’t. Dear Nikki-chan, it upset
me that Fuyuu Kotonoha didn’t show me her true self anymore. It depressed me
that she treated me the way she would people who wanted to use her for personal
gains. And it maddened me that I wasn’t as close to her as the members of the
Yamazaki household, or worse, that Yamazaki Shizuka who spent every waking moment
chasing after her red <i>hibakama</i>.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>I tried to shrink the distance between us, I even came into
her room once or twice just to talk, but she only gave me odd looks in response
and continued to be close-mouthed as a mussel. On the surface, a tree was
probably a better conversationalist compared to Fuyuu Kotonoha, except that I
know it wasn’t true. The girl who sat next to me that night, who spoke to me
about her troubles, who blushed at me, who held me in her arms and told me I
was the lucky person who received her first kiss, was much livelier and
lovelier than the ice block I saw every day. I only wished she could act that
way toward me again.</p>

I insisted on tailing her like her own shadow regardless of where she went –
well… short of the bathroom, restroom, and her own living quarters – in the
hope of making her open her heart to me. I wasn’t making much progress around
then, seeing how she barely spoke two words to me unless out of necessity, but
I was contented, and strangely so, with following her. It disturbed me somewhat
that I was rather obsessed over her, obviously, but I managed to convince
myself that I was fed up with being all alone in the Shrine. It worked.</p>

traveled to town every time a dove carrying a message reached Shrine. Usually
it was because a sickness that no doctors could cure had befallen some poor
folks, most likely demon-related in some ways. And of course, Yamazaki Shizuka
just had to appear <i>every single time </i>we emerged from the Kagemori
Forest. I still don’t know how the merchant’s daughter managed such a feat. She
couldn’t have hounded the Colonization Office, where the doves were stationed,
all day… could she?</p>

predicted that Yamazaki Shizuka wasn’t going to give up just because the former
announced that she had a girlfriend. It was the opposite. The whole drama
episode at merchant’s daughter’s birthday party only made her chase after the
Priestess in a much fiercer manner. She simply <i>refused</i> to admit defeat!
There were times I thought that she had the tenacity of ten men. I don’t think
I was mistaken.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

the merchant’s daughter tagged along. Yet… eventually I noticed that I had a
tendency to glare at other people, sometimes even snapped at them, whenever the
three of us treaded upon the same street. The closer Yamazaki Shizuka was to
Fuyuu Kotonoha, the worse my mood got, and the thinner my patience grew.
Nikki-chan, I’m ashamed to admit that sometimes when I watched the merchant’s
daughter clung to the raven-haired girl’s arm, when I coughed before I reminded
her that she should pay attention to common decency and was blatantly ignored
afterwards, I dearly wished that choking people to death was legal. She ticked
me off so badly that I had to spend much of my strength just to keep my hands
still lest they go for her <i>throat</i>. I didn’t think I could stop myself,
or wanted to, once that happened.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>And you know what, Nikki-chan, Fuyuu Kotonoha didn’t exactly
resist the merchant’s daughter, which blew my mind. See, the raven-haired girl
had elaborated at length how much it bugged her that all Yamazaki Shizuka
wanted to do was getting into her bed. Yet, the way she acted nonchalantly toward
the girl’s most indecent and unacceptable behaviors gave out the impression
that she didn’t mind.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>I came into Kotonoha’s room one day and suggested to her that
if she wanted Shizuka to stop pestering her, she had better be more serious
about it. The blank stare the Priestess greeted me with was most discomforting.
You could have thought that I had spoken in a different language. There wasn’t
anything else I could do at that point so I left, mumbling angrily to myself
how the raven-haired girl could be so detached. Never <i>once</i> did I stop to
think why I was <i>that</i> worked up about <i>her</i> dating issues.</p>

believed, when the Mayor of Unomichi sent a dove to the Priestess. The stocky man,
who was Kugimiya Karasu’s secret servant in Unomichi, as it turned out, wanted
to talk to Fuyuu Kotonoha about a few government proposals concerning the
Shrine.</p>

walking out from Kagemori Forest was Yamazaki Shizuka. Despite the fact that I
was rather upset, too upset for my own comfort in fact, I noticed something
strange about Shizuka on that day. The corners of her lips were tight, and
there were signs of tiredness around her red, swollen eyes. Some would say that
the merchant’s daughter had spent the night before in tears.</p>

just peeling an onion before I came here, that’s all.” A pathetic lie, that.</p>

you, Shizuka-san,” Kotonoha said in a very gentle voice. I almost gritted my
teeth. “You know I care about you.” My mouth dropped open.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Yamazaki Shizuka looked up at the raven-haired girl –
Kotonoha was a head taller than Shizuka, but only half a hand taller than me –
in a way that spoke volumes of genuine anguish. Tears welled up in her eyes. My
housemate blinked in shock, and I was slightly taken aback by the reaction.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then… would it be okay if we can talk in… private?” Shizuka
said, gesturing toward an empty alley nearby. Without giving me the merest hint
of a glance, the raven-haired girl nodded, took Shizuka’s hand, and led her
toward the alley, where they stood opposite each other and talked. I wasn’t
sure how I myself looked then, but when several passers-by saw me, they gave a
violent start and scurried off. I wonder if I seemed that frightening.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I merely stood there, watching the two other girls standing
and talking in the alley. At first, Yamazaki Shizuka was an arm away from the taller
girl but after every minute, her body drew closer, her mouth moved faster, and
her fists would clench harder as tears silently dropped from her face.
Kotonoha, on the other hand, betrayed no emotion that I could see. Back
straight as an oak tree, the Priestess spoke to the merchant’s daughter with an
expression that would fit more on a rock.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Then it happened. Kotonoha opened her mouth and said
something. I couldn’t possibly guess what she said just by looking at the
movements of her lips, but whatever it was, it made Yamazaki Shizuka weep
harder than ever. After a while, the merchant’s daughter looked up at the
raven-haired girl with a tear-drenched face and muttered something as she
grabbed Kotonoha’s shoulder and shook it. Slowly, Kotonoha nodded. My mind went
blank the moment the Priestess put her arms around the shorter girl’s shoulder,
pulled her closer, and kissed her on the lips. My head could have done for any
roaring furnace. My heart could have been housing the heaviest thunderstorm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not saying anything, I walked back toward the Northern Gate,
which led me to Kagemori Forest. Upon its treacherous paths, under its dim
light, surrounded by its sacred silence, I merely stepped forward. I’d been
living with Fuyuu Kotonoha for a little more than three months and a half, every
day of which she spent an hour or two helping me learning the ways in Kagemori
Forest, so I was able get home without her, or maybe even with my eyes squeezed
shut.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, I hated crossing Kagemori Forest all by myself –
the atmosphere was too creepy – but on that day, I could have been walking on
any of Unomichi’s crowded roads. The tall trees, which usually resembled
monsters at first glance with their thin, weirdly shaped branches, looked to me
as dignified as any of the townsfolk. The deep gorges and the sheer cliffs
might have not been there. In what seemed as short as a heartbeat, Kagemori
Forest gave way to <i>Furisame Jinja</i>, the Shrine of the Falling Rain. I
found myself in my room in a blink of an eye. It was as if I never walked
beneath the Torii Archway, pushed open the Main Gates, and arrived at the
Residential Area of the <i>Jinja</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>It was still early in the afternoon, but there was nothing I
needed to take care of, and I was feeling extremely terrible, so I changed my clothes,
spread out the futon, climbed inside, and pulled the blanket over my head. I
tried to sleep. I couldn’t. As soon as I pulled down my eyelids, the scenery in
which Yamazaki Shizuka was lip-locking with Fuyuu Kotonoha popped up in my
mind, and my eyes would spring open immediately. The same thing repeated for
several more times before I gave up. I curled up in a ball beneath the thick
blanket, trembling slightly while having no idea why. My eyes stung, and my chest
hurt. I cried. I couldn’t make myself stop. All I managed to do was keeping my
voice down. The more tears I shed, the sadder I became, and the harder the cold
hand around my heart gripped. My thoughts started to wander.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Between the sobs that I failed to smother, I recalled what I
had seen between Yamazaki Shizuka and my housemate in that empty alley. The
only conclusion I could come up with was that the merchant’s daughter had
finally conquered the icy Priestess Fuyuu Kotonoha, which would conveniently explain
why Shizuka burst out crying. Anyone would have said that those were tears of
joy. It was only logical to assume that way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Slowly, an explanation for my strange behaviors dawned on me.
<i>“You haven’t heard that you can’t choose the one you fall in love with, no?”</i>
Kugimiya Karasu’s voice whispered faintly in my head. It suddenly made so much
sense why I was feeling so depressed just because Yamazaki Shizuka clung to my
housemate, why I was crying my eyes out just because Kotonoha smooched another
girl in front of me. I’m dimwitted, agreed, but not so much so that I wouldn’t
recognize love when it hit me in the face. And you know, Nikki-chan, the
knowledge squeezed more hot tears and strangled sobs out of me. What could be
more painful than realizing that you had fallen helplessly in love with someone
who treated you like a stranger, who happened to have chosen another person for
her romantic interest? There’s none.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

voice spoke almost on top of me. Hastily, I used my sleeves to scrub at my face
and dry the tears I had shed.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

raven-haired girl continued coolly after a moment of dead silence.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I fear you have a serious misunderstanding, Amano-san,”
Kotonoha said calmly, if a tad breathily. “The fact that I kissed a girl does
not necessarily make her my girlfriend. I was merely <i>granting</i>
Shizuka-san’s request.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What was that? You kissed her just because she wanted you
to?” I exploded as I sat up straight on the futon, hurling the blanket away
with my hand. Then I found Fuyuu Kotonoha sitting there, her face <i>glowing</i>
with a strange expression which I didn’t know how to read. The cool mask of
serenity she always wore was nowhere in sight. In front of me was the
raven-haired girl who had talked to me on that fateful night at the Yamazaki
household. My tongue froze, and my anger subsided like a tide ebbing from the
beach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

and shrugged. “All she wished from me was something to remember me by. Their whole
family is moving to Nagano next month, you see.”</p>

Colonization Office?” the raven-haired girl continued at a nod of my head. “His
work records have been nothing short of excellent, so the Chief of the local
Office had nominated him to his supervisors, who in turn appointed him to fill
a vacant post in Nagano. Apparently, Koutarou-san is going to become a very
high-ranking official.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Indeed so.” The other girl nodded. “However, Koutarou-san
dearly cherishes his family, so he insisted on bringing them with him. Yamazaki
Mai-san, proud of her son and moved by his love, agreed. There is no other
choice for Shizuka-san except going along.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Is that the reason why her eyes were so red this morning?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes, she cried herself to sleep last night.” Kotonoha
grimaced. “She came to me this morning to ask if there was some way she could
work and live in the Shrine.” The raven-haired girl smiled at the anxious look
on my face. “I refused. I explained that the Shrine’s financial situation left no
room for a third person. And that <i>you,</i> my girlfriend in name, would not
be pleased.” She pulled a hand over her mouth and chuckled softly. Those were
the most beautiful sounds I ever heard.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I... I can care less!” I stuttered, feeling blood rushing to
my face and warming it up rapidly. “She can move in any time.” Kotonoha’s chuckle
grew richer, deeper, and much more amused. She knew I lied…. She let it slide,
though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Shizuka-san was distressed,” Kotonoha said. “She was aware
she would not be able to see me for a very long time, so she requested that one
kiss, which I gave to her.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I see,” I murmured, and was startled by the joyous note in
my tone. The raven-haired girl gave no evidence that she noticed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You have not answered my question, Amano-san,” Kotonoha
said. “Why did you leave me in Unomichi and return to <i>Furisame Jinja</i>?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I... um…” I said after a deafening moment of silence. In my
head, I hurriedly searched for an excuse. I found one immediately, much to my
relief. “I wasn’t feeling well… so I wanted to head back home and sleep.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Are you alright?” Without the slightest hint of a warning,
Kotonoha leaned over and put her forehead against mine. Had I not kept my mouth
shut in time, I would have gasped. Had I not forced my arms to stay still, I
would have thrown them around her back and hugged her. “Your face is red, your
forehead is burning, and your breaths are heavy.” Kotonoha frowned while slowly
drawing her slender frame back. “I should bring you to a doctor.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No, no, it’s okay!” Words rushed out of my mouth. “I’ll just
need a good night’s rest, that’s all!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“But your face is wet,” the other girl said softly. “You have
been sweating, have you not?” she took out her handkerchief from inside her pocket
and used it to dry the tears on my face, which she called sweat. Her gentle
touch upon my cheeks lit up a furious flame beneath my skin. I thought that
should I let her keep it up, she’d cook my brain alive.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s… it’s okay,” I stammered. “I’ll… do it on my own!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Sure.” She smiled at me and gave me the piece of white cloth
the corner of which was sewn with an elegant golden lily. It was the same
handkerchief she had lent me during our meeting in the Colonization Office. It was
smooth like her skin was, and it smelled faintly of her fragrant scent.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Are you quite certain that you are alright?” the raven-haired
girl’s voice dragged me back to reality. “Very well,” she said after several
frantic nods of my head. “But Amano-san, if you had felt unwell in the first
place, you should have told me. I would have never let you go back to the
Shrine in such a condition.” Her voice grew firmer and firmer. She seemed
stern, and somewhat scary, yet were she to yell at me for the rest of the day,
I would be happily sitting there, listen to her every word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You can’t blame me for not telling you, though,” I said. “You’ve
always acted as though you never cared if I dropped dead.” I winced at the
unintended accusing tone.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Where did you get such an idea?” Kotonoha appeared shocked
to the base of her foundation. “I would never forgive myself if something
happened to you. Amano-san, you are very important to me, do you not know?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, if the Emperor waltzed in and announced that he
would abdicate the throne to me that instant, he still couldn’t possibly make
me as happy as Kotonoha did by saying those simple words. Warmth flooded my
whole body, bliss welled in my heart. I took her hand, folded on her lap, into
both of mine and squeezed it with as much affection as I could manage without
hurting her. The raven-haired girl’s face turned a little pink. Still, she
didn’t take her hand back, so I continued to relish the feel of her silky skin,
wishing I could hold her hand forever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I am?” I said softly. “Why?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Because…” Kotonoha hesitated, “you are the most efficient
employee anyone could have asked for. And you really helped me out on
Shizuka-san’s birthday, to which I am still grateful. So, I... well… you see… I
am very… fond of you.” The pink shade of her complexion went beet-red as she
struggled to get the last few words out, which sent my heart galloping.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You are?” I murmured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Of course.” Kotonoha sighed. “If I were not, I would not
have been so anxious when you disappeared in town. I was so afraid that
something bad had happened that I even canceled the meeting with the Mayor to
search for you.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Thanks,” I mumbled, “and I’m sorry I worried you.” Nikki-chan,
that had been such a touching moment for me; too bad it was ruined by a growl
that came from my empty stomach. My face burned in embarrassment while Kotonoha
laughed quietly to herself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“That reminds me,” she said afterwards. “I should make
dinner.” She paused, and we stared at one another for another while before she
dropped her obsidian gaze and murmured softly. “Amano-san…. My hand?” I gave a
slight start and let go of her. Freed, Kotonoha rose to her feet and walked
toward the shoji door to my room, her ears so red anyone would have thought
they were burning. I wasn’t sure mine were not the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Fuyuu-san,” I called.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes?” she answered, smiling faintly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Your handkerchief….”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, why don’t you keep it, Amano-san?” she said as her
smile deepened. “If I remember correctly, you do not have one. Or do you not
want it?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I do!” I said, maybe a little bit faster than what I could
have wanted. My face warmed up so rapidly I thought it was on fire. “Um,
thanks,” I mumbled quietly, my hand pressing the silky piece of cloth to my
heart. I was so happy at that time, knowing that I then had in my possession
something that belonged to the one I loved. I even vowed that I would treasure
it forever and ever. Little did I know what Kotonoha had in mind when she gave
me the handkerchief.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You are very welcome.” She chuckled softly into her hand,
appearing so happy that anyone would have thought she was the one who received
the gift.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Um, Fuyuu-san, would it be okay for me to come and help you prepare
the food?” Noticing the sudden frown on her lovely face, I added, “I’m feeling
better already! Please?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Very well,” the Priestess nodded. “However.” She raised a
peremptory finger. “You must promise me that you will not overwork yourself,
okay?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I promise,” I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then what would you like for dinner tonight, Amano-san?” A dazzling
smile bloomed on her lips. The sunset had never seemed more dazzling when we
walked alongside each other to the kitchen, where we spent an entire afternoon
making a feast that would put a shame to the best restaurant in town. I only
did the slight stuffs, of course, like cutting vegetable or handing Kotonoha
spices and dishes. I had nothing to do most of the times in the kitchen – or
rather she didn’t let me – so I usually ended up standing around, watching the
raven-haired girl cook. Even when her face was drenched with sweat, her white
yukata stained by oil, and her hair slightly disarrayed, her beauty wasn’t
marred in the least bit. I was so charmed by the occasional smiles she gave
when she turned to look at me that I almost forgot how to breathe.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Oh, it’s time for me to leave again. I’ll see you tomorrow,
Nikki-chan. Jaa ne.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in'>&nbsp;</p>
