<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>      &quot;She kind of makes me think of Eveon,&quot; Abby said, looking down at Hina sleeping in the 
bed. &quot;Actually... Eveon was right around her age when all this madness started.&quot;

      Sakura smiled lightly and sat down on the bed. &quot;They seem a lot... better now.&quot;

      The blonde mother grinned. &quot;Probably because they&#39;re not trying to kill us. I just 
hope they&#39;ll be alright - I&#39;m not much of a psychologist, but after being brainwashed like 
that...&quot;

      Sakura began to absent mindedly stroke Hina&#39;s hair. &quot;They&#39;ll be okay... I mean, 
we&#39;ll... we&#39;re all going to help them, right?&quot;

      Abby nodded and watched as Hina started to wake up. Sakura quickly pulled her hand 
away as the girl sat up and looked at her sleepily. Suddenly, the angel was caught up in a 
huge embrace by the blonde girl. &quot;Big sister! I was so scared!&quot;

      Sakura just sat there stiffly, exchanging looks with Abby. It was then that Hina 
pulled back and noticed that while the white haired woman she was holding had looked like 
Hoshi when she first woke up, she wasn&#39;t her.

      Hina shot back and covered herself with the sheets. &quot;You... you&#39;re not big sister...&quot; 
Her cheeks were bright red in embarrassment.

      Sakura slowly shook her head as Abby laughed. &quot;Nope, this is Sakura and she most 
definitely isn&#39;t Hoshi...&quot; She trailed off, thinking. &quot;Hina, do you want anything to eat or 
drink or...?&quot;

      She shrunk back more into the covers. &quot;Um... I... don&#39;t know.&quot; She looked between the 
two of them. &quot;I&#39;m sorry! I never... wanted to do those things to everyone, but... we 
couldn&#39;t help ourselves...&quot; She looked down at her knees instead of meeting the gazes of the 
two women.

      &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Sakura said, getting up. She held her hand out to Hina.

      The girl tentatively took it and the couple led her out of the room. 

***** 

      &quot;She&#39;s still sleeping,&quot; Mina said, looking over at Tsuki. Eveon shrugged.

      &quot;I guess she must be really tired. They seemed kind of okay when they first woke up.&quot;

      With a sigh, the two girls sat down in the chairs by the bed. Eveon let out a slight 
laugh. &quot;I hope we&#39;re done with most of this magical stuff. Things keep happening and we&#39;re 
so out of the loop.&quot;

      &quot;Ugh, tell me about. I gave up explaining it to my parents last year. My dad still 
doesn&#39;t get it and all my mom knows is the demon that kidnapped me isn&#39;t evil and Abby has a 
new... err, partner.&quot;

      The corner of Eveon&#39;s mouth twitched. &quot;Partner...?&quot;

      Mina shrugged. &quot;I have no clue what our moms talk about when they get together and I 
just don&#39;t want to take a chance on how little she may know about what goes on over here.&quot;

      &quot;So they have no clue that we used our virgin powers to save the day?&quot;

      &quot;Basically.&quot; Mina smiled. &quot;Though I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be happy about the virgin part.&quot;

      They heard a groan and turned their attention to Tsuki, just now awakening. The 
brunette turned a few times in the bed and seemed startled to see the two other girls. She 
shut her eyes and took a deep breath. &quot;I... I&#39;m going to guess that this all isn&#39;t a 
horrible nightmare.&quot;

      The sympathetic looks on the young couple&#39;s faces affirmed Tsuki&#39;s suspicions. 

***** 

      &quot;Uh, um, Krystal...!&quot; The blonde turned around in the hallway to see Isaka right 
behind her. The demon swallowed, trying to think of something to say. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

      Krystal was confused. &quot;What are you sorry for? You haven&#39;t done anything wrong.&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, but I feel like... I haven&#39;t been treating you as good as you deserve.&quot; As 
Isaka finished her statement, her girlfriend hugged her.

      &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you? Just having your love is enough,&quot; Krystal murmured as she 
felt the demon&#39;s arms wrap around her waist.

      &quot;I just feel like such an idiot since some of the stuff Tsuru said was true. I have a 
hard time with expressing myself and-&quot; Isaka was cut off with a searing kiss and Krystal 
giggled as she pulled away.

      &quot;You&#39;re usually the one kissing me,&quot; the blonde said. &quot;If I didn&#39;t understand how you 
felt, would I have stayed this long with you?&quot;

      The demon let out a slight laugh before nuzzling into Krystal&#39;s neck. &quot;You&#39;re much too 
kind for your own good... letting an evil demon like me have you all to myself...&quot;

      Krystal pulled away and motioned down the hall. &quot;I&#39;m going to go check up on Hoshi. It 
maight be better if you wait here since you gave her a bit of a tongue lashing.&quot;

      Isaka sighed but sat down in the hallway, up against the wall. &quot;But if you need that 
tongue of mine to motivate her, just call me.&quot;

      There was an awkward silence as Krystal&#39;s face turned red. Isaka looked away with a 
giggle. &quot;That sounded naughty, huh?&quot;

      Krystal just went into the room to see Hoshi. 

***** 

      The woman had been awake for a while, settling for staring at the ceiling. The sheets 
were comfortable and her body ached with the beginnings of sore muscles, so she had every 
reason to stay in bed. The reality was she didn&#39;t want to go face the world.

      As the door opened, she turned over on her side, trying to pretend she was asleep. She 
must not have moved fast enough because Krystal said, &quot;Hoshi?&quot;

      The silver haired woman let out a slight sigh as the blonde sat down on the bed. &quot;Are 
you ready to get up?&quot;

      &quot;...I don&#39;t think I will ever be ready.&quot;

      &quot;Are you still worried about your sisters?&quot; Hoshi flinched. &quot;I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t blame 
you... you were under someone else&#39;s control, so-&quot;

      &quot;But that&#39;s not true,&quot; Hoshi whispered. &quot;I allowed myself to be controlled because it 
gave me something to hide behind. As long as I could tell distance myself from my guilt, 
then there was nothing to worry about...&quot;

      Krystal was silent for a moment. &quot;If you tell them that it wasn&#39;t because you wanted 
too, then they would understand-&quot;

      &quot;I wanted to do it Krystal. It started... I don&#39;t know when it started, but I&#39;ve had 
these perverse feelings for both my sisters for a long time.&quot; Hoshi curled up in the bed. 
&quot;And those feelings are still inside of me.&quot;

      There was another pause as Krystal let it all soak in. So Hoshi had really been 
lusting after her sisters for that long and everything she said under the influence of the 
Demon Lord was true...

      &quot;You think I&#39;m disgusting, don&#39;t you?&quot; Hoshi asked. &quot;It&#39;s alright - there&#39;s something 
horribly wrong with a woman who would desire not only her sisters, but one who is still a 
child...&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not disgusting,&quot; Krystal said almost immediately. &quot;It&#39;s sad, but not disgusting. 
You never told them that you loved them like that, did you?&quot;

      Hoshi shook her head. &quot;No, no of course not. I thought I could pretend it was alright, 
but once I had the opportunity, I took away their innocence.&quot;

      Krystal peered over at her. &quot;But when I was with all three of you at the shrine, you 
were all so close.&quot;

      Hoshi opened her mouth and merely mumbled, &quot;It was probably the curse forcing them...&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t think so. Even if they don&#39;t reciprocate your feelings, you need to talk to 
them.&quot; Krystal only watched as Hoshi buried herself deeper under the covers. &quot;You... you 
don&#39;t have to do it right now... I&#39;m going to go get you something to eat, alright?&quot;

      &quot;Thank you, Krystal... even after everything-&quot; Krystal cut Hoshi off.

      &quot;It&#39;s fine. I&#39;m sure if our situations were reversed, you&#39;d do the same.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Do you... do you need any help?&quot; Sakura was quickly ushered out of the kitchen by 
Eveon after asking her question.

      &quot;Nah, me and mommy got it. Just go sit down and relax.&quot; The angel plopped down with a 
sigh at the dining room table.

      &quot;They don&#39;t need help?&quot; Mina asked.

      Sakura shook her head. &quot;I... I tend to burn things so they don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t let me do anything 
anymore...&quot;

      Tycara flinched. &quot;Yeah, that time you helped was... pretty bad mommy...&quot;

      Seth let out a slight laugh. &quot;I guess old habits die hard... they didn&#39;t call you the 
Living Inferno for nothing, did they?&quot;

      Sakura went a barely noticeable shade of pink as she sunk further into her seat. The 
other two girls sitting at the table were very quiet. Tsuki was staring awkwardly at the 
placemat as Hina just looked around the house. After apologizing profusely to most of the 
guests of the house, they were told not to worry about it.

      Tsuki was deep in thought as Krystal came into the room, but Hina only had one thought 
on her mind. &quot;Krystal!&quot; The blonde girl exclaimed, startling the older woman.

      &quot;Oh, Hina. You and Tsuki are awake... that&#39;s good,&quot; she said with a smile.

      Hina just continued. &quot;We... we wanted to apologize, but I was wondering if big sister 
was awake yet?&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s smile faltered. &quot;No, she&#39;s really tired so I was going to bring her some 
food.&quot;

      Hina started to get out of her seat. &quot;Can I come with you? I really want to talk to 
her-&quot; However, she was stopped by Tsuki who caught Krystal&#39;s eye.

      &quot;Hina, I think you shouldn&#39;t.&quot; The blonde girl looked confused until Tsuki rephrased 
her words. &quot;I mean, big sister needs more rest and she will be too tired to talk if we go 
see her.&quot;

      Hina settled back into her seat with a frown. Krystal understood what made Tsuki stop 
her sister. While Hina was young enough to write off their past transgressions to an evil 
influence, it seemed Tsuki knew the truth - or at least, part of the truth about their big 
sister.
