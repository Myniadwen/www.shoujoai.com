<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 25 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>      &quot;Oh, I hope nothing has happened to her,&quot; Isaka whined out, biting her thumb.

      &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;s okay. Whatever they&#39;re planning hasn&#39;t been done yet so she&#39;s okay,&quot; 
Tsuru said, though obviously just as distraught as her demon companion. Behind them were 
Bakra and Seth, discussing the intricacies of the Demon Lord and such. The demon male was 
currently receiving death glares from Tycara, who wasn&#39;t too fond of him talking to her 
boyfriend.

      Abby and Sakura watched with much amusement, their young daughter walking between 
them. She was almost nearing the age of puberty and after that... well, she&#39;d be able to 
normally date Seth again - going to the playground just didn&#39;t cut it.

      At the very end of the group, Faye was doing her best to keep from laughing. Erin 
squeezed her hand, hard, to try to get her to stop. The two goddesses were making sure 
nothing happened in the rear and little Posh-Posh was slithering around to check for traps. 
Of course, the red head was too amused by the conversation of the pair in front of her, much 
to the disdain of her lover.

      &quot;...what do you think about?&quot; Eveon was confused by Mina&#39;s question. The two girls 
were under the watchful eyes of a set of goddesses, one laughing discreetly.

      &quot;What do you mean? I think about a lot of things,&quot; the blonde replied, not sure where 
the conversation was going.

      &quot;I meant, what do you think about when... you know...&quot; Mina made some funny hand 
gestures and Eveon let out a long groan.

      &quot;Seriously Mina? I&#39;ve already been embarrassed in front of everyone by my mommy and 
now you want to know more about it?&quot;

      Mina just gave her a small smile. &quot;It&#39;s okay - I do it too. I just want to make sure 
that it&#39;s about me.&quot;

      Eveon flushed bright red. &quot;Fine, it&#39;s you, alright? Can we drop it?&quot;

      The ebony haired girl peered closer at her girlfriend. &quot;...but you don&#39;t think about 
any other girls, do you?&quot;

      The blonde froze. &quot;H-hey! We don&#39;t have to explicitly share about those kind of 
things... you don&#39;t see me asking who you think of.&quot;

      Mina gasped. &quot;So you do think of someone else! I knew it!&quot;

      Her girlfriend tried to calm Mina down. &quot;Sorry, but it&#39;s mostly you, I promise!&quot;

      &quot;But who else?!&quot; Mina&#39;s question was soon answered as Eveon&#39;s eyes swiveled none too 
discreetly to a certain angel walking in front of them.

      It was Mina&#39;s turn to freeze up, but it wasn&#39;t long until she yanked on the collar of 
Eveon&#39;s t-shirt and hissed into her ear, &quot;That&#39;s gross! She&#39;s your mom!&quot;

      &quot;Not really! I can&#39;t help it,&quot; Eveon protested, trying to wrench away from Mina. 
&quot;Shoot, she&#39;s really pretty and sometimes she helps me with baths and she tucks me in at 
night and... and...&quot; She trailed off, noticing the look she was getting. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me 
like that - you&#39;re the one that said you thought my mommy was attractive and Sakura and I 
aren&#39;t related.&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, but I only think of your mom occasionally-&quot; Mina stopped upon realizing what 
she just said. Eveon looked just as surprised.

      &quot;You... you really think of my mommy like that?&quot; Eveon whispered as her girlfriend 
tried to cover it up.

      &quot;No , no! I... uh... why wouldn&#39;t I think so highly of the woman who gave birth to the 
girl I love?&quot;

      Eveon let out a sigh. &quot;Mina, you&#39;re attempt to turn something sleazy into a romantic 
moment is cute, but it totally failed. You&#39;re never going to live this down...&quot;

      With that, the blonde started to walk a bit faster, Mina having to increase her pace 
to catch up. &quot;Wait, Eveon! Please, it&#39;s not like that! I promise I&#39;m not weird...!&quot;

      She couldn&#39;t see the small grin on Eveon&#39;s face so she didn&#39;t know she was being joked 
with. Faye, on the other hand, found it hilarious. Erin sighed and pinched her cheek. &quot;You 
shouldn&#39;t use those abilities of yours to eavesdrop on them...&quot;

      The love goddess pouted. &quot;I do it out of good will. I didn&#39;t do any harm, anyway. I 
can only read people&#39;s passion, not affect them.&quot;

      Speaking of the two goddesses, as they continued down the long corridor of the 
labyrinth, Isaka took a peek at them, then at Tsuru. &quot;Hey... uh, how was it?&quot;

      Tsuru looked at the brunette. &quot;How was what?&quot;

      &quot;Erin and Faye...?&quot; The demon asked, hoping her companion would pick up on it.

      Tsuru took in a breath of air. &quot;It was... it was awesome. I don&#39;t know what I was 
thinking when I tried to get out of it.&quot;

      The demon smirked. &quot;See! I knew you just needed a good night of tender-&quot;

      &quot;That doesn&#39;t mean I forgive you.&quot; Isaka&#39;s bit of joy died. Back to square one.

      They walked next to each other for a few minutes before Tsuru spoke again. &quot;...and you 
were right about Erin&#39;s tongue.&quot;

      Isaka would have started professing how she was right about the whole thing until 
Erin&#39;s golem snake shot out of the ground in front of them to take a few knives in the head. 
&quot;We&#39;re under attack,&quot; the snake goddess said, in case her companions didn&#39;t notice.

      Hina laughed at the sight, &quot;Wow, they&#39;re so many of them. Much more than last time.&quot;

      &quot;True - but we have a new ally too so it should even out,&quot; Tsuki responded, having a 
tight hold on the incapacitated Carmilla.

      Isaka recognized her right away. &quot;Carmilla?! How did you get a hold of her?&quot; Her 
question was left unanswered as Tsuki forced the vampire to summon a shadow beast. It 
immediately went about attacking Erin&#39;s golem.

      Bakra drew his sword and stepped in front of Seth. &quot;Alright, here&#39;s the plan. Me, Erin 
and Faye will take care of these three while Abby and Sakura make sure no else gets hurt. 
Tsuru and Isaka - you should go further to take out Hoshi.&quot;

      Isaka grinned and grabbed Tsuru by the wrist. &quot;Don&#39;t need to tell us twice!&quot; The two 
started to go past the shadow beast, but another was summoned before meeting its demise at 
the hands of holy magic.

      Eveon and Mina were staring at Sakura, who managed to take out the monster in a quick 
blast. &quot;That&#39;s so cool,&quot; the blonde said.

      &quot;I didn&#39;t even know she could do that,&quot; Mina replied.

      Abby on the other hand was having trouble with what to do. &quot;Tycara, you said I have 
some of your power... so how are we going to make this work?&quot;

      Seth chose that time to run away from the midst of the battle and give advice. &quot;If 
Tycara has one component of her abilities and you have the rest, if you both concentrate and 
establish physical contact, it should work.&quot;

      Abby gave him a deadpan look. &quot;So just hold hands and pray we don&#39;t get slaughtered?&quot;

      Tycara grabbed her mother&#39;s hand with a smile. &quot;Heed my call! Blades of heaven and 
hell!&quot; Abby felt a shock run through her as the swords appeared in front of them. So Seth 
was right...

      Faye let out a sigh. &quot;Okay, less yapping, more helping.&quot; Isaka and Tsuru were facing a 
flurry of knives, but they were no match for the love goddess&#39;s ribbon work. Even Bakra was 
able to help out by getting close enough to Tsuki to distract her from making a seal... but 
he was immediately blasted off by a pyre art. Great.

      Isaka looked back at the mess behind her, what with giant dragons, snakes, floating 
swords, ribbons... yikes! &quot;Hurry up!&quot; Tsuru called to her.

      &quot;Right, right, I&#39;m coming, don&#39;t worry...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...so do we just suck at this whole entire fighting thing?&quot;

      Mina shrugged at Eveon&#39;s question. &quot;I dunno. Maybe they&#39;re just really good.&quot;

      &quot;Well, I suppose it has something to do with the fact that those girls are bound 
servants of the Demon Lord and are exorcists. With their ability to use holy skills and dark 
magic, they can effectively attack each member of the current fighting force. Then, they 
have Carmilla and her shadow beasts. By continuously spawning those giant monstrosities, 
they give trouble to everyone, especially when couple by Hina&#39;s intuitive weapon skills,&quot; 
Seth replied, taking a deep breath.

      &quot;Thank you, nerd...&quot; Eveon murmured and turned back to the scene with disdain. Okay - 
they weren&#39;t losing, but they sure as hell weren&#39;t winning. Abby and Tycara were providing 
back up while Sakura flew around to make sure there were no surprise attacks... Erin&#39;s golem 
was taking a bite out of shadow beasts... Bakra was deflecting weapons, taking out shadow 
beast and trying not to get friend by Tsuki... and Faye was doing a little bit of 
everything.

      Yet, they weren&#39;t winning. It was like the sisters were purposefully stalling - not 
actually going for the kill. Eveon sighed. Boring... she&#39;d gotten tired of the flashy 
attacks about 15 minutes ago and this was plain ridiculous. Where was the combo breaker? 

***** 

      Speaking of ridiculous.

      &quot;Goddamn it Isaka! We&#39;ve passed this same corridor seven times!&quot;

      &quot;I can&#39;t help it if the Demon Lord is a fan of mazes!&quot;

      &quot;Can&#39;t you sense out Krystal?&quot;

      &quot;Do I look like a dog demon?&quot;

      &quot;Well, with the way you act with women, you might as well be one-&quot;

      &quot;Shut up!&quot;

      The pair of woman took a deep breaths before heading down another path. They ran head 
first into a maze and didn&#39;t even know how to get out... Tsuru wished she&#39;d brought chalk 
with her. That would have made things easier. After some point, Isaka let out a gasp.

      &quot;This area is totally new!&quot;

      &quot;No it isn&#39;t - this was where I shoved you into the wall. There&#39;s still a mark there,&quot; 
Tsuru said, ruining the moment.

      The demon let out a slight growl and kept walking. After sometime, they came to a dead 
end with two paths. One to the left... one to the right. This was definitely new.

      &quot;Should we split up?&quot; Tsuru nodded in response to Isaka&#39;s question.

      &quot;Yeah... and if we hit a dead end or start going in circles, we&#39;ll just head back here 
and go down the opposite corridor. We&#39;ll for sure meet up like that,&quot; the blue haired woman 
said.

      &quot;Sweet! I&#39;ll take the right.&quot; With that, Isaka ran down her path, leaving Tsuru to run 
down hers... She was hoping she&#39;d find Krystal before the demon and get... well...

      Tsuru couldn&#39;t help but imagine getting a kiss as a reward for saving her. Of course, 
that would only happen in her daydreams. With a sigh, Tsuru started running down her path, 
not knowing what was at the end. 

***** 

      Tsuru finally found herself in a rather large, dark room. She could see a door at the 
end, but stopped walking towards it at the sound of a jingle. Hoshi was behind her, staff in 
hand.

      &quot;It didn&#39;t take you too long to get here,&quot; she said with a smile.

      &quot;Where&#39;s Krystal?&quot; Tsuru asked, keeping a hand on her large sword.

      &quot;You&#39;re here to save her aren&#39;t you? Instead of Isaka?&quot;

      Tsuru looked confused. &quot;We&#39;re both here to save her.&quot;

      Hoshi just gave her a secret little smile. &quot;Yes, but you want to be the one, don&#39;t 
you? You&#39;ve always wanted to be the one to get your way - to get revenge, to get what you 
want, to get Krystal.&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re spewing about, but you&#39;d best hand her over,&quot; Tsuru said, 
walking towards the exorcist.

      &quot;Of course, of course, but first,&quot; Hoshi took a step back. &quot;Tell me what you want.&quot;

      Tsuru froze on the spot. What she wanted? Wasn&#39;t it simple - everything Hoshi said. 
She wanted revenge, a life, but... most of all... she wanted Krystal to love her.

      &quot;How do you know about my feelings?&quot; Tsuru asked, tensing up. Something wasn&#39;t right.

      &quot;It&#39;s so painfully obvious that you want her. You want Krystal to hold you, to kiss 
you, to love you...&quot; The silver haired woman trailed off. &quot;Isn&#39;t it infuriating to know that 
she&#39;s in love with Isaka and will never give you a chance? You, one so much better than that 
simple demon?&quot;

      Tsuru looked away. It was all true, but... why did Hoshi-?

      &quot;I can give it to you, everything you want.&quot;

      The blue haired girl stood, shocked. &quot;You can, but how-&quot; She stopped as soon as she 
felt a jolt through her body. She couldn&#39;t move and her eyes swiveled to Hoshi, who was 
grinning like a cat who set a trap.

      Tsuru could only watch as the symbols lit up around her and she suddenly realized she 
had stepped right into a ritual seal. The jolt entered her body again and she fell to her 
knees as the energy was sapped out of her. It was like, it was like-

      Something was taking her over, so dark and cold. It clutched at the inner reaches of 
her own person and Tsuru realized she was in trouble. As she tried to pull away from 
whatever was attacking her, Hoshi came closer. The silver haired woman kneeled down next to 
her and murmured, &quot;Don&#39;t fight it. You&#39;re going to get exactly what you want.&quot;

      Tsuru held her stomach as she started to lose herself in the darkness. She watched 
Hoshi walk over to the edge of the seal.

      &quot;Eternal gates of damnation, unseal before me...&quot;
