<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch56.html">Back to Part 56</a><pre>Amber sat upon her spot in the window, watching Kimberly and Penny 
curled up in their bed. Sarah had helped them carry Kim to the bed. Kim 
seemed to be in some kind of coma like state and would not respond to 
any form of stimulate. Hoping that the girl would soon awaken they 
dressed her before tucking the girl under the covers with Penny resting 
next to her. Amber recalled the many time she would lay next to Jessica 
in the wee hours of the night, her love fast asleep in her arms. She 
would try to resist the urge to brush a lock of the girl&#39;s messy curls 
out of her eyes for fear that it would only awaken Jessica. So she would 
simply lay there with the moonlight played shadows across the girl&#39;s 
face and envision all the things she wished to do with Jessica when they 
escaped the madness of this house. She frowned as she reminded herself 
that none of those dreams would ever come true. Jessica abandoned her 
the moment she got a chance and was never returning. She was going to be 
trapped within these walled until she was old and grey or when her 
brothers finally got tired of her and put an end to her miserable life, 
as Sarah had envisioned they would. 

&quot;Can&#39;t sleep huh, Amber?&quot; Sarah inquired from her spot on the top bunk. 

Amber nodded, &quot;I can&#39;t get what has happened today out of my mind.&quot; She 
glanced over at Penny to see the girl&#39;s silk belt hanging off the back 
of the bed, &quot;I can&#39;t believe that thing actually existed. Where did Kim 
find it anyway?&quot; 

Sarah glanced over the railing at the belt below, &quot;I thought Penny made 
the thing up actually. It makes no sense.&quot; She looked at Amber, &quot;And 
what was with that black stuff in the tub earlier? It looked like it was 
trying to drown Kimberly.&quot; She let out a shudder at the memory of the 
black tar writhing in the tub and Kim&#39;s small hand forcing itself 
through the surface from time to time, &quot;How did you know that that stuff 
would not pull you in with it?&quot; 
 
Amber shook her head in confusion, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know.&quot; She admitted 
sheepishly, &quot;At first I was scared then seeing Kim fighting with it made 
me feel the need to help her so I shoved my arm in as deep into the mess 
as I could. It felt cold and my hand felt numb. It was almost as if the 
tub had no bottom.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just glad you managed to pull Kim out of that gunk.&quot; Sarah stated 
gratefully, still amazed by what she had witnessed, &quot;It was like 
something from my nightmares. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m brave enough to stick my 
hand in that goo.&quot; She remarked guilty, &quot;I&#39;m worthless. I can never 
protect anyone like you or Kim or Jessie even.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not brave.&quot; Amber turned her head and rest it upon the cool glass 
of the window, &quot;I&#39;m not brave at all.&quot; She glanced down at the trees as 
they swayed in the breeze. Suddenly something small hit the window under 
her head, &quot;What was that?&quot; She scanned around the darkness in search of 
what could have hit the window when another object tapped against the 
window again. 

&quot;What was what?&quot; Sarah inquired as she quickly, but quietly, descended 
the bunk bed&#39;s ladder. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Amber continued to search for what could be making the 
sound when she saw a small shadow in the middle of the lawn. The shadow 
darted around as if in search for something, &quot;I think there is someone 
down there.&quot; Again something hit the window, &quot;I think they&#39;re throwing 
rocks!&quot; 

Sarah approached the window and tried to help with the hunt, &quot;Who would 
be down there?&quot; Sarah inquired curiously, &quot;And how would they know we 
are up here?&quot; 

The shadow stepped into the light of a street lamp and waved up at the 
girls. Amber became stunned by what she saw before her, &quot;JESSIE!!!&quot; She 
cried out loud, not realizing she had raised her voice. 

&quot;Shhhhh.&quot; Sarah hushed the girl and quickly glanced around to see the 
other girls were still fast asleep, &quot;You don&#39;t want to wake everyone up, 
do you?&quot; 

Amber quieted her voice, &quot;But it&#39;s Jessie.&quot; She exclaimed, softly this 
time, &quot;She came back to us.&quot; 

Sarah squinted out the window; there in the streetlight she could see a 
small girl in baggy overalls, white t-shirt and a mess of wavy hair upon 
her head, &quot;My god!&quot; She exclaimed aghast, &quot;It really is her. Why did she 
return if she had already escaped this place?&quot; She puzzled. 

&quot;She came back for us.&quot; Amber stated confidently as she struggled to get 
the window to open, &quot;Dammit, why did they have to lock the windows too.&quot; 
She remarked in frustration, &quot;It&#39;s not like we are going to jump off the 
roof.&quot; She pulled on the window as it squeaked in protest. 

Sarah anxiously glanced at the bedroom door and back to Amber, &quot;Are you 
crazy?&quot; She inquired nervously, &quot;You are going to get us all sent to the 
basement. Or worse... the cupboard and I don&#39;t want to end up there.&quot; 

The window was now open a crack and Amber jumped off the sill as if she 
had given up her efforts, &quot;Where are they?&quot; She inquired frantically as 
she started to scramble around the loose clothing in the corner around 
where Caitlin slept 

Sarah ventured over to her sister, &quot;What are you going on about?&quot; She 
whispered, not wanting to wake the other girls. 

&quot;Ma&#39;am had given April some colouring books and crayons.&quot; Amber 
explained as she sifted through the clothes, &quot;I remember seeing her 
playing with them around here the other day. AHA!&quot; She pulled a tattered 
colouring book out from under a sweater then began her search for the 
crayons. 

&quot;What are you going to do with that thing?&quot; Sarah inquired curiously, 
then stepped on something hard that snapped under her foot, &quot;I think I 
found a crayon.&quot; She remarked, picking up a broken red crayon off the 
ground. 

Amber quickly snatched the crayon from Sarah&#39;s hand, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She 
rushed back to the window and started to write on the only page of the 
colouring book that she could find that was not covered in scribbles. 

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Sarah repeated, curiously watching the girl. 

&quot;I&#39;m writing Jessica a note.&quot; Amber explained simply as she scribbled 
out a few words upon the page in hopes that Jessica would be able to 
read it. Without another word to Sarah she tore out the page out of the 
book and folded it several times, &quot;I just hope she sees this.&quot; She 
tossed the paper through the small crack in the window, and then waited.
