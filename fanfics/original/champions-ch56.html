Dear Friends Farewell Tour

 
Two weeks passed.

It took little time for Yohko to recover from her physical trauma, but 
the mental and emotional storms raging in her head would take months 
more.  Yui was always a steadfast part of her recovery, and hardly left 
the doctor&#39;s side during those difficult moments.  Although everyone had 
their own idea of how to deal with the deranged woman, eventually it was 
decided that they would leave her in peace, to rectify her own problems 
and to experience the punishment her wicked deeds gave her.  In time, 
Yohko even atoned for this, and made a total change in her philosophy.  
Although she still hated the so-called superheroes for what they had 
done to her brother, she could forgive them a little after feeling what 
it was like to be one of them.

MERCS was transformed during this time.  Its claim of offering housing 
and work for drifter heroes had been a front for Yohko&#39;s research; now, 
it was dedicated to science and technology, a place of discovery and 
healing for those who sought it.  Yohko and Yui spent the rest of their 
lives taking people in and mending their wounds, and except for rare 
circumstances, never saw any of their old &quot;comrades&quot; again.  And that 
was just fine with them.

Alyssa Hunter was one of the first to leave her temporary home.  With 
the war over, Lyn back in their number, their enemies defeated and 
everything more or less tied up, she had no further business in staying.  
She was scheduled to leave with the other Battle Divas, whose number had 
shifted slightly with the addition of Miss Shival, who proclaimed fealty 
to Mora.  As the Siren was packing the last of her bags&#151;making sure her 
women&#39;s suits were tucked away carefully&#151;she spied Pandora the Gambler 
passing her room, perhaps off to skulk or say farewell to some nice 
member of staff.  Alyssa pursued her; naturally she was promptly told to 
leave the older woman alone.

&quot;Nothing has changed between us,&quot; Soma said, giving Siren a one-eyed 
glare.  &quot;I still cannot forgive your kind for what you&#39;ve done.  One of 
these days, I will have my revenge.  But...not today.&quot;

&quot;No?&quot;  Soma let out what might have been a smile.

&quot;I&#39;m not a total barbarian.  You may think I&#39;m evil, but I know how to 
express gratitude.  And I do admit, you have saved my bacon a couple of 
times.  Alyssa,&quot; (and that, to her recollection, was the only time Siren 
ever heard Soma address her by name), &quot;I hate the heroes, but not what 
they stand for.  Not some of them, anyway.  And...if it&#39;s any comfort, I 
don&#39;t hate you.  But don&#39;t get me wrong.  Just because I don&#39;t hate you, 
that doesn&#39;t mean I like you or anything.  Just stay the hell away from 
me, and everything will be fine.  Got it?&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot;  She waved politely&#151;a tiny little gesture, that&#151;tipped her hat, 
and mumbled out a &quot;So long.&quot;  Siren never saw or heard from her again, 
but that did not mean that the world had not seen the last of Soma von 
Zomren.

&quot;You okay?&quot; came a sound from behind.  Siren turned and smiled at Xianq, 
cheerful as ever.

&quot;Yeah.  That weirdo bitch is finally out of our hair.  Maybe now I can 
pine after a nice girl.&quot;

&quot;Hmm.  Good luck with that.  You almost done?&quot;

&quot;Just about.  You guys go on ahead; I&#39;ll catch up.&quot;  Xianq made herself 
scarce and left Alyssa alone.  She took a deep breath, examined her room 
for the last time, and stepped out of it and her two-time home, never 
once looking back.

Finding a new hideout for the Battle Divas wasn&#39;t as hard as the girls 
thought it&#39;d be.  When he wasn&#39;t investigating something or getting his 
hands dirty, Jacob Pochanski had been scouting out a new residence for 
his ever-growing team.  The surviving members of the Savage Six 
suggested using their old headquarters, which was conveniently in the 
middle of a big city and could easily house thrice the Diva&#39;s numbers.  
Pochanski went ahead to prepare a place for his team; that left the 
others to pack their belongings and prepare for another move.

&quot;Another foreign home,&quot; Kathlyn Shival said to herself, moments before 
she and her lover Mora left MERCS for good.  The silver-haired maiden 
was taking a break, and stood poised on one of the many balconies that 
overlooked the sprawling wilderness that surrounded her one-time home.  
The wind seemed worn-out&#151;who could blame it after that violent storm 
fourteen days earlier?&#151;so her hair only shifted when she willed it to.  
Two strong arms were grasped around her waist, squeezing possessively as 
if they were afraid the body would abandon them again.  Mora kissed 
Lyn&#39;s shoulders daintily, her words scarcely accompanying her lover&#39;s 
thoughts.

&quot;But home is home, Lyn.  And this time we may stay.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...  Being in that big huge place with all those girls?  
Spending most of my time with you by my side?  Having the noise of the 
city infect my every waking moment?  I&#39;m starting to yearn for the 
jungle.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have to go there.  You and I could just run off and live in 
the woods together.  It could work.&quot;  Lyn smiled and pressed her palms 
against Mora&#39;s hands, adding pressure to her midsection.

&quot;No...I&#39;ll just have to get used to it.  It&#39;s all right if I don&#39;t have a 
&#39;real&#39; home; what&#39;s important is that I just have a home, nothing more.  
And yeah, it&#39;d be nice if you were there with me.&quot;

&quot;All that space to ourselves,&quot; Johsen sighed, tickling Lyn&#39;s ear.  &quot;We 
could hump like sex-crazed fiends and nobody&#39;d know.&quot;

&quot;Who said we would?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just saying,&quot; she giggled, the sound husky and erotic.  Lyn drew a 
deep breath, turned slowly, and touched Mora&#39;s cheek with her lips.

&quot;I guess...it won&#39;t be so bad, will it?&quot;

When Julie Smith heard that Kris was moving into the city, she literally 
jumped at the chance to go with her.

&quot;But don&#39;t you have your own set of friends?&quot; Masterson asked her.

&quot;Yes, but they all going their own way.  Some going far, some going 
places I never hear of.  I couldn&#39;t go with them all, so I go with you!&quot;  
Both girls smiled; Kristen was touched that Julie would want to go with 
her and the other Battle Divas.

&quot;So, you want to become a Diva, huh?  It&#39;s not easy work, Jules.  Father 
Pochanski might seem like a nice guy in public, but he really gives it 
to us when we&#39;re training.&quot;

&quot;I not mind.  I be with Krissy, so I happy.  Are Beeg, Lyssa, and Mora 
coming too?&quot;

&quot;We all are,&quot; said Xianq, who was passing by with a large box in her 
hand.  &quot;Now if you two are finished flirting with each other, we&#39;ve got 
a lot of moving to do.  I haven&#39;t even had a break yet, but you don&#39;t 
see me slacking off, now do you?&quot;

&quot;Whatever,&quot; Kris groaned.  Julie giggled and said the exact same thing.  
The two of them eventually loaned their aid to the moving process; 
Pochanski himself pulled Xianq aside, gazing into her young face with 
visible concern.

&quot;Are you all right with this?  You won&#39;t see your boyfriend as much if 
you stay with us.&quot;

&quot;Father, please!  What else would I do, move in with him?  I&#39;m only 
eighteen; I&#39;m not ready for any of that yet.  And it&#39;s not like we live 
far apart from each other; it&#39;s the same darn city.  We&#39;ll run into each 
other a lot.&quot;

&quot;Is that so?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s so, now help me with these boxes before I collapse!  I dunno 
why you won&#39;t even let me have a candy bar.  If I crumble into pieces, 
I&#39;m blaming you!&quot;  Pochanski laughed quietly and did as he was told, 
muttering something about how he was getting too old for this sort of 
thing.  Nobody in the Battle Divas saw a need to say farewell to 
anybody, since they anticipated seeing one another now and then.  After 
all, it was a small world, and there would always be crime to thwart.

There were two people that nobody would ever see again, so everyone said 
goodbye to them.  Skye and Alisti were the last to leave MERCS 
headquarters, and they only left last because they felt obligated to 
personally part with everyone.  Most people merely spoke a few awkward 
words, but some leaped forth and embraced the two, and a few even wept.  
It wasn&#39;t as if nobody cared; Alisti and Skye just seemed more distant 
than anyone else.  The only world they were caught in was each other&#39;s, 
so it was fitting that, once everybody left their home to forge a new 
path, they found their own corner of the planet to reside.

Mr. White was no longer with them and so could not make good on his word 
to send the two companions off on a deserted island, but that was merely 
a setback.  After all, Skye did have the ability to fly, and for many 
days and nights, she bore Alisti on her back as she sought a new home 
for them.  After a long journey, the two came across a small island 
completely untouched by the hand of man, and settled down on the beach.  
For the first few moments, they merely stood on the shore and beheld 
their new home, their only movement being the slight twitch of fingers 
as they reached out, clasped hands, and squeezed lovingly.

Evil Eric as Alisti &quot;Disintegrator&quot; Kreager

 
&quot;Alisti said she was going with Skye,&quot; Namie indicated.  &quot;Julie&#39;s going 
with Kristen, no surprise there, and Merry&#39;s going to find an apartment 
in the city.  I think she wants Sally to move in with her.&quot;

&quot;And what about us?&quot; Shalis asked.  Namie smiled brightly.

&quot;Well, I did grow fond of that place we shared before we moved in here.  
We could just settle in there and live comfortably.  You could start 
your own company, and I could be a happy little housewife.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Shalis retorted, chuckling a little.  &quot;I don&#39;t want you cooped 
up in the house all by yourself.  You need to find a job, kid.  What do 
you like to do?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot;  Namie blushed a little and folded her hands neatly.  &quot;I&#39;ve 
always wanted to run a nursery.  Even when I was cursed, I wanted to be 
a mother, as futile the hope was.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m able to have kids 
or not&#151;I needn&#39;t even ask you&#151;so this is about as close as I might 
come.&quot;

&quot;All right, that sounds good.&quot;  Namie was quiet for awhile as she stared 
at her lover.

&quot;Wait&#151;are you serious about this?  You really want to move in, get jobs, 
do all that stuff?&quot;

&quot;Sure, why not?  What else are we going to do?  I feel like retiring 
from the so-called superhero business anyway.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Namie sighed.  &quot;I&#39;ve seen enough action to last me a lifetime.  
So...you&#39;re really serious about this.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, are you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m dead serious, Shalis.  ...So...um...what about...the housewife 
thing?&quot;  Shalis looked over and winked, then returned to her work.  Just 
a few more files to secure...

&quot;Oh, we&#39;ll take care of that when we get there.  Don&#39;t worry; I fully 
intend to make an honest woman out of you.&quot;

&quot;Oh, and now I&#39;m not?&quot;

&quot;Namie, don&#39;t argue with me,&quot; Shalis said playfully.  &quot;You won&#39;t win.&quot;

&quot;What if I flutter my eyelashes, or tickle your arm?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s cheating, honey.&quot;  Namie laughed; she tickled Shalis&#39;s arm 
anyway, just to rouse her.  A new life for the both of them...

&quot;I can hardly wait.&quot;

And so, when they only had each other as company, Amielle and Alicia 
wandered into the world, each resuming their travels with each other, 
now no longer burdened with the havoc of a fugitive&#39;s life.  Their 
individual levels of darkness had been lifted; they were now free to 
really live, to see what else the world could give them, and to 
experience the boundless love they shared for each other&#151;two fallen 
angels, saved by the greatest of all powers...

As Sanaa and Marissa clasped hands, two souls united in death and life, 
and everything in between, they beheld their own misty future, and 
looked at it without fear or worry&#151;for those who have true souls need 
not yield to terror, as a life spent alongside a loved one awaits them 
no matter which place they may occupy.

&quot;Let&#39;s go, Marissa,&quot; Sanaa said.  &quot;If we don&#39;t make it in time, we&#39;ll be 
late.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m right behind you.&quot;

&quot;Just look at them,&quot; Rin said, hoisting her arms atop her head as she 
walked beside her lover, her rival, her closest friend and greatest 
challenge, the lady Snowblood herself.  &quot;Aren&#39;t they the cutest?&quot;

&quot;Rin...&quot;

&quot;I know, I know, it&#39;s just an expression.  But you don&#39;t need to see to 
know what they&#39;re doing.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot;  Setsuka laughed quietly as she picked up the sound of 
squealing.  Kailin, Kathy, BaoBao, and little Kohona were playing with 
each other, their shrieks piercing the sky with a beautiful melody.  The 
Ronin, as they were all calling themselves, had set about their aimless 
journey as soon as they could, feeling that their time spent chained 
down was over.  None of them knew where they were going next&#151;not that it 
mattered&#151;so the overwhelming sense of freedom was a welcome experience.  
Setsuka felt she could truly be happy from then on out, although 
coupling herself with Rin and the others might&#39;ve negatively affected 
her income in the long run.

She edged closer to Rin and took her hand, smiling shyly.

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever get used to this,&quot; Rin said, breathless.  How 
strange it still felt to think of Setsuka as a lover!  But then again, 
nobody else could pluck heartstrings&#151;or samisens&#151;quite like her.

&quot;There&#39;s trouble brewing,&quot; Kailin said, referring to Rin and Setsuka&#39;s 
closeness.  Kathy giggled.

&quot;Yeah, definitely.  At least we&#39;re cute together.  I&#39;m surprised they 
still aren&#39;t trying to kill each other.&quot;

&quot;No, they got that out of their systems, thank god.  I think they&#39;re 
just happy to be rivals instead of enemies.&quot;  BaoBao, feeling neglected, 
made a little yawp, crying for Kathy&#39;s arms.  The Guardian Angel bent 
down and scooped the ball of fuzz into her grasp, chuckling merrily as 
she tickled the panda.

&quot;I think there was a song that goes along with this,&quot; she said, pointing 
to the road.  &quot;Something about wanderers not knowing where they go, as 
long as they have a journey together.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never heard it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll bet Miss Hinomoto has.  We should ask her to play it; it&#39;s really 
quite lovely.&quot;

&quot;Can you sing?&quot;

&quot;Yes, actually, but it&#39;s better with an instrument.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;  Kailin smiled, and then, randomly, kissed her girlfriend on the 
cheek.  Kathy smiled, blushing prettily, and took Kailin&#39;s hand (keeping 
BaoBao nestled safely in her other arm) as they all went down the same 
path.  It didn&#39;t matter where; sometimes the journey is better than the 
destination.

When the restoration team came to the city, they knew they had their 
work cut out for them.  It had been devastated in the war, and there was 
hardly anything left worth saving.  The whole place was in ruins...but 
human spirit and determination (and a bit of stubbornness) can see 
anything through, and so the team got to work, the ghosts of countless 
others slowly being put to rest...

&quot;You&#39;re not going with them?&quot; Aura asked as she and Joanna watched the 
Ronin leave.

&quot;No, not yet anyway.  I&#39;ve done a lot of bad things in my life, and I 
have to start making up for them.  I still feel guilty for it all, 
especially the things I did for Dr. Kamaguchi.&quot;

&quot;You had no way of knowing that what you were doing was helping her 
achieve more power,&quot; Aura said, squeezing Joanna&#39;s hand.  &quot;It&#39;s not 
entirely your fault.  You were just being used.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so...but I have no excuse for being a thief.  Before I can join my 
friends, I have to start giving back to the people.  Aura, you can do as 
you please; you don&#39;t have to follow me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really?  Well then, it pleases me to follow you.&quot;  She leaned up 
and kissed Joanna&#39;s cheek, making the tan person flustered.

&quot;H-hey, don&#39;t do that.  You&#39;ll embarrass me.  Why do you even&#151;&quot;  Before 
the Ferret could say another word, Aura put her finger over Joanna&#39;s 
mouth, silencing her.

&quot;Because I want to.  Because I like you.  Stop thinking you&#39;re worthless 
just because you have...extras.  I think you&#39;re good enough.&quot;  Aura then 
kissed her finger, nearly brushing Joanna&#39;s lips.  If the Ferret had 
been flustered by a mere peck on her face...

&quot;O-oh, r-really?&quot;  Aura giggled and took the older person&#39;s hands.

&quot;Yes, r-really!  And since you&#39;re going to be doing good deeds, I think 
we should start by going to that village that Christine Velshoni is in.  
I have something I need to return to her.&quot;

&quot;Your good-luck coin, right?&quot;  Aura nodded, bright and cheerful as ever.  
&quot;You have a kind heart, my lady.  I am glad to be within its vicinity.&quot;  
The younger woman gave a little squeal, kissed Joanna again, and 
together the two of them took off into the next phase of their lives.

Neither Joyce Jameson nor Sarah Neuss had a home to go back to; MERCS 
was the only one they really knew.  They feared to stay behind&#151;they 
wanted nothing more to do with Kamaguchi&#151;but they also feared living on 
their own.  They were both still too young to live by themselves, and at 
first it seemed like nobody could (or would) take them in.  A stroke of 
good fortune came their way at long last when Haanz Glucklig, the 
inimitable Spoon Man, volunteered to let them live in his own home.  The 
two girls were relieved, and thanked him by throwing their arms around 
him.  Regrettably, they were too young for him to make a pass at...

&quot;Can you give me just a second?&quot; Joyce asked before they left.  &quot;I have 
something to take care of.&quot;  He told her to take her time, and so she 
scurried back into the building, racing up the stairs and through 
winding passageways until she came to Yui Miyamoto&#39;s room.  Out of 
everyone there, only Yui had ever treated Joyce fairly, and so it was 
fitting that the young girl say farewell to her at least.

&quot;Yui?  Can I come in?&quot; she said as she knocked.  The door was open; Yui 
was doing paperwork, but of course she was.  As the new vice-president 
of the building, she had more and more duties to fulfill, and little 
time for anything else, save the needs of the child she took in.

&quot;What can I do for you, Joyce?&quot; she asked.  The young girl paused for a 
moment, still shy in the presence of others.

&quot;Umm...I just wanted...to say thank you, for being nice to me, even when 
everyone else was afraid.  Thank you for what you did.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re very welcome.  Are you leaving soon?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll see you again......&quot;

&quot;I can give you my contact information.  Just because we live apart, 
that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t exchange pleasantries.  Look, Joyce, I 
know you hate Yohko for what she did to you, but please don&#39;t hold that 
grudge for too long.  She really was a wonderful person before 
this...disaster happened.&quot;

&quot;If you say so.&quot;  Yui handed Joyce several business cards, all of them 
printed with phone numbers and addresses.

&quot;Here you go.  Please don&#39;t hesitate to call me&#151;after all, you&#39;re like a 
daughter to me.  Oh, wait&#151;your bear!  Do you want to take him?&quot;  Joyce 
faltered only for a second before looking up at Yui&#39;s face and smiling 
confidently.

&quot;No...no thanks.  I don&#39;t need it anymore.  Why don&#39;t you keep it, and 
give it to someone else?&quot;

&quot;...All right, if you say so.  Goodbye, for now, and good luck.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;  Joyce did a little curtsey, and was out of the room in a 
flash.  Yui gave a little melancholy sigh&#151;that girl was growing up 
quickly.

On the way to their new home, Joyce fell asleep.  Sarah kept her head 
nestled in her lap, and caressed the girl&#39;s beautiful black hair all the 
way...

And then, there were three.

Two weeks had gone by&#151;Sally&#39;s sentence would be just about over now.  As 
soon as she could, Miss Redinger had returned home to her family.  After 
much weeping and mirth at the return of their daughter, her parents 
promptly grounded her for going so long without contacting them.  They 
were now literally sick with worry, as Stevenson was prone to become, 
and made their daughter pay for it in the worst way possible.  Not one 
to sit idly while their friend was encaged, Merry and Steve joined 
forces to find a new place for their blue-skinned friend, just so that 
this sort of thing wouldn&#39;t happen again.  Their search was 
unfortunately fruitless, and they were forced to reunite with Sally 
empty-handed.  At the time, though, it didn&#39;t seem to matter.

&quot;What great friends I have,&quot; she gushed, embracing them both.  &quot;It&#39;s all 
right if you didn&#39;t find a new place.  I need to spend some time at home 
anyway, to make up for my absence.  Mom and dad are still a little 
pissed off, so I hope you understand.&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; Merry said.  &quot;Just...whenever you&#39;re ready.  And hey, since 
you&#39;re not grounded anymore, how about a date?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love one.  Sorry Steve, girls only.&quot;

&quot;Bah.  Like I&#39;d want to be around a couple of weirdo lesbians like you.  
My girlfriend may be hyperactive, but at least she&#39;s normal-looking.  I 
mean, blue skin and pink hair?  Get real!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just jealous,&quot; they said.  Steve sighed, and gave Sally his 
final regards before leaving the two girls to their devices.  It was 
going to be a great day, they could tell.

Two days later...

To make up for her immaturity the other day, Sally spent the day with 
Steve, her first and closest friend.  Both Merry and Xianq were busy 
doing their own thing, which left their respective love interests free 
to catch up on old times.  They mostly wandered around outdoors, taking 
advantage of the weather, but dashed inside for lunch.  It seemed like 
ages, they agreed, since they had met so long ago.  The world seemed 
more romantic and ideal back then, their future unlimited and their 
possibilities broad.  Now, countless experiences later, they were a 
fully-grown man and woman, stronger and wiser from it all.  They could 
reflect on the past all they wanted; it wouldn&#39;t change anything.

&quot;So,&quot; Sally said as they sat in the McCray kitchen, &quot;what do we do now?&quot;

&quot;You mean today?  Or in general?&quot;

&quot;In general.&quot;  Steve finished chewing his food before answering.

&quot;I dunno.  We do what we need to do, I guess.&quot;  The kitchen phone rang; 
Steven smirked and said, &quot;Speaking of which...  Hello?  Yes, this is he.  
.........Really.  ...Really?  ...You&#39;re kidding!!  ...Oh, you&#39;re not 
kidding.  Oh, gee.  ...Wow.  Wow, really?  Okay, um&#151;yeah, yeah...  Yeah.  
Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be right there.  Okay, thanks, bye!&quot;  He hung up; 
Sally peered at him questionably.

&quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;One of my father&#39;s police friends.  He got a hot tip from a local 
witness saying that there&#39;s a new villain team in town calling 
themselves &#39;Maelstrom&#39;.  They&#39;re raising all kinds of trouble and the 
police want us to do something about it.&quot;  Sally immediately put her 
food down and jumped to her feet, ready for anything.

&quot;Well what are we waiting for?  Let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;I was hoping you&#39;d say that!&quot;  It took only a moment for the two 
seasoned heroes to don their costumes and head out the door, and from 
the looks of things, they would need every moment available to them.  
Steve and Sally&#151;Thunder-Claw and G-Force&#151;smiled at each other and 
clasped hands in camaraderie.

&quot;Well,&quot; he said, &quot;here we go again!!&quot;
 

Another day, another evil rises,

Another day, another hero answers the call.

This never-ending cycle continues,

For the world will always have a need for champions.

 
THE END
