The group of four girls sat upon the couch in the basement, happily 
eating pizza. Star and Am&#39;s presents lined up on the table, a crystal 
frog from Star to Sam and a stuffed bear from Sam to Star. They both 
hugged each other and loved their presents dearly, surprised that each 
knew what the other would want. Now they were relaxing with a movie 
lightly playing on the TV.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe we made it through that alive.&quot; Trish breathed, 
shuttering at the thought of Star&#39;s father with the gun in his hand, &quot;I 
thought we were dead for sure.&quot;  

Beth pulled Trish into arms, &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t die, I don&#39;t know what 
I&#39;d do without you.&quot; She said and lightly kissed the girl. 

Star stared at her cousin in shock, &quot;Since when have you liked girls?&quot; 
She inquired curiously. 

Beth turned and smiled at her cousin, &quot;A lot longer then you I suspect, 
I just didn&#39;t tell you because unlike you I keep my private life 
private.&quot; 

Star looked at the two girls suspiciously, &quot;Have you two had sex yet?&quot;

Trish chocked on her pizza that she just pit into and Beth handed her a 
can of pop, who took it gratefully and drained it, &quot;STAR!?! You are as 
bad as mom.&quot; Beth shouted at the girl. 

Star shrugged, &quot;I was just curious, I wanted to know what it felt like.&quot; 

Beth glanced over at Sam, &quot;Well now is your chance to find out.&quot; She 
said with a sly grin. 

Star flushed brightly and Sam mimicked the blush, &quot;Bethany!!!&quot; Star 
shoved her cousin playfully. 

Beth put up her hands in defence, &quot;Well are you two going to start 
dating at the very least?&quot; 

Star stopped hitting Beth and turned to face Sam, who was still 
blushing, &quot;I... I never really thought about that.&quot; 

Sam scratched the back of her head, &quot;I was too busy worrying that you 
would reject me to think about anything else.&quot; 

Star turned on the couch to face the girl, &quot;Now why would I reject you? 
I told you we were friends didn&#39;t I?&quot; She stated confidently. 

Sam continued to blush and could not return the girl&#39;s gaze as she 
fiddled with the hem of her shirt, &quot;Yeah, but that was before you saw me 
in person. You could have chanced your mind.&quot; She admitted miserably. 

Star leaned forward and turned her head so she could look up at the 
girl&#39;s face, &quot;You are right, you are not very pretty when you frown like 
that.&quot; She smiled up at the girl, causing Sam to smile slightly. Star&#39;s 
grin broadened at the sight of Sam&#39;s smile, &quot;That is better. Your smile 
is very cute.&quot;

Sam shook her head at the girl, &quot;You are silly, you know that.&quot; 

Star lowered her eyes, &quot;Silly... is that a good thing.&quot; 

Sam nodded, &quot;I like insanity, it is better then normality that is for 
sure.&quot; Sam&#39;s face brightened and she called out to the girl in her mind, 
((And who would give up a connection like this.))

Star looked into Sam&#39;s eyes, ((You really don&#39;t mind our minds linked 
like this?)) She inquired nervously. 

Sam nodded, ((It means we&#39;ll never be apart, no matter what happens.)) 

Star&#39;s eyes darted about then back up at Sam, ((Do you really want to be 
with me? I mean don&#39;t you find any of this kind of strange.)) 

Sam laughed, ((I&#39;m used to strange.)) She remarked. 

&quot;Alright you two.&quot; Beth said staring at the girls, &quot;Could you let us in 
on your little conversation?&quot; 

Trish glanced between the two in disbelief, &quot;Does that mean your minds 
are linked again.&quot; 

Star curled up in Sam&#39;s arms and grins at the girls, &quot;Yep!&quot; She said 
gleefully, &quot;And nothing will ever pull us apart.&quot; She glanced up at Sam, 
&quot;Right?&quot;

Sam nodded, &quot;Right.&quot; She lowered her head to lightly kiss the girl upon 
the lips. Star pulled back for a moment and then smiled and returned the 
kiss, pulling herself up onto Sam as she deepened the kiss. 

Beth batted her cousin on the back of the head, &quot;Enough of that. Get a 
room.&quot; She said playfully. 

Star parted from the kiss and shivered, a mischievous look in her eyes, 
&quot;Do you want to go to your room?&quot; 

&quot;WHAT?!?&quot; Trish and Beth both exclaimed in shock. 

Star gave the girls a wide grin, &quot;Gotya!!&quot; She cried out happily, 
clapping her hands together.

Sam let out a deep breath, &quot;You had me going there too.&quot; Sam said, 
trying to slow her heart down. 

Star smiled at the girl, ((Who knows what the future will bring.)) She 
said with a wink. Abruptly the sound of muffled chimes and beeps drifted 
through the air and the girls looking around in search of the sound. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Star picked up her handbag off the coffee table and pulled out the 
toad Meephit from inside, &quot;I forgot all about this thing.&quot; She said with 
a smile. 

The girls all leaned in close to look at the toy, &quot;It really does look 
like the one I got Sam last year doesn&#39;t it?&quot; Trish inquired curiously. 

Sam nodded, &quot;I can&#39;t believe all of this is because of that silly toy.&quot; 
She remarked uneasily. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad it did.&quot; Star stated happily and preceded to retrieve the 
device from its stomach, &quot;I wonder what it is trying to tell us?&quot; She 
stared at the screen and blinked, &quot;Hey Sam... look at this...&quot; 

She leaned closer to the girl so she could get a better look. Blinking 
across the screen was a series of word, &quot;Congratulations Samantha and 
Star. Your Meephit has evolved to the next level, thanks for playing. I 
hope you enjoy our next game.&quot; 

&quot;NEXT GAME!?!?&quot;

The End
