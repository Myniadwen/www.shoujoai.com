<h1>Through Death Comes Life (part 4 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>      In fact, the Living Inferno did come, later that afternoon. Abby wouldn&#39;t have noticed 
him if it weren&#39;t for the fact that he was standing in the backyard. Again. Actually, she&#39;d 
been passing the glass sliding door that led to the backyard when she noticed him. She 
wasn&#39;t sure why he acted the way he did, but she reckoned he wouldn&#39;t come in unless 
invited.

      &quot;You know you can knock,&quot; she said, poking her head outside. He looked over at her. 
&quot;I... do not wish to disturb you.&quot; Abby could only guess that he was embarrassed. &quot;It&#39;s 
alright, come inside. I&#39;ll make you some tea.&quot; She left the door open and he walked in, 
silent as ever, before carefully closing the door. For a man with metal claw-like hands, he 
handled things with such care.

      Abby started the kettle on the stove again, getting out the tea bag and a cup for the 
Living Inferno. &quot;Did you leave because of Krystal and Isaka?&quot; She didn&#39;t even bother 
explaining who they were - if the Living Inferno had such great powers, he would already 
know who they were. She saw him nod out of the corner of her eye. &quot;Why?&quot;

      He looked over at her, before looking at the table. &quot;...I am... what you may call... 
timid.&quot; Abby tried not to laugh. Something about that struck her as funny. Here he was, a 
man wearing fierce armor and he was scared of a pair of lesbians. &quot;They told me that you 
were like a grim reaper and that you might steal Eveon.&quot;

      For the first time, Abby thought she could hear some real emotion in his voice. &quot;I-I 
would never steal away Eveon! Parents... a mother is everything to a child. I would never 
want to separate you,&quot; he said, sounding distraught and waving both armored hands back and 
forth. Abby started to pour the hot water into the tea cup. &quot;I know. Plus, Eveon&#39;s a bit old 
to be kidnapped, huh? Speaking of which, she&#39;s coming over with her girlfriend today.&quot;

      Abby set the tea cup in front of him and watched as the Living Inferno took it 
tenderly in his hand before meandering over to the corner. The blonde woman held up a hand 
to stop him, but decided to let him go. He was probably more comfortable in that corner. She 
briefly entertained the idea of making him a sign. She listened to him drink and he 
eventually said, &quot;Thank you. It is very good.&quot;

      Curiosity was starting to get the best of her. &quot;You can take the armor off, can&#39;t you? 
Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t be able to eat or drink or go potty. Why do you wear it?&quot; She could 
visibly see him stiffen, crouched in the corner. &quot;...It is my form of atonement. I did 
something unforgivable so now I guide lost souls. I am hoping to be forgiven for my sin and 
the person I am looking for is the person I need to protect and beg forgiveness from.&quot;

      The rather tense atmosphere of his words dispersed as Abby listened to him sip at the 
tea again. She sighed and rested her head in the palm of her hand. There was just something 
so funny about him crouching in the corner, sipping tea, as he explained that he needed to 
atone for his crimes. Abby was going to crack a joke and point the irony out to her 
oblivious friend, but she heard the door open and close.

      &quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; Eveon called out and Abby could make out the sounds of Mina talking as 
well. The Living Inferno left his corner and set his tea cup in the sink. The two girls came 
into the kitchen and Mina visibly froze at the sight of the Living Inferno, but said 
nothing. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s the Living Inferno. He&#39;s some guy my mommy met,&quot; Eveon said simply and 
Mina just gave him a strange look.

      Then again, after meeting so many strange people, the ebony hair girl just waved and 
said, &quot;Nice to meet you!&quot; Everyone else in the room visibly relaxed. Abby was kind of afraid 
Mina would flip a lid like Eveon, but then again, the young girl didn&#39;t meet the Living 
Inferno by waking up in the middle of the night and finding him next to her bed. He seemed 
to feel very awkward and there was a moment of silence.

      &quot;Well,&quot; Eveon said, &quot;Me and Mina have to go do homework-&quot; Abby just snorted, &quot;-but, we 
can hang out later, okay?&quot; The Living Inferno nodded and started to relax when Mina gave him 
a reassuring smile. As the two girls went upstairs, Mina said, &quot;He&#39;s pretty creepy 
looking...&quot; Eveon just sighed and took her hand. &quot;Tell me about. He&#39;s actually really nice 
though.&quot;

      As they entered Eveon&#39;s bedroom, Mina closed the door before presumptuously wrapping 
her arms around Eveon&#39;s neck. &quot;Pray tell, how much homework do you think we&#39;ll actually get 
done?&quot; Eveon let out a sigh, but didn&#39;t complain as Mina started to kiss her. 

***** 

      &quot;GAH! How could we lose,&quot; shouted Abby&#39;s favorite lesbian couple. After finishing 
their homework (both girls&#39; clothing was suspiciously disheveled) Eveon and Mina decided to 
spend time with the Living Inferno. And by spend time, they decided to play chess. 
Unfortunately, even with the two girls working together, they were beat quite badly.

      The Living Inferno just said, &quot;Together you&#39;re doing much better...&quot; The two girls 
were sure he was just saying that to make them feel better. &quot;Rematch!&quot; Eveon called 
triumphantly and started setting the pieces up. Mina on the other hand was thinking 
carefully to herself, trying to figure out how they lost so quickly.

      Abby just sighed and turned a page in her magazine. &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re going to 
lose again.&quot; Eveon pouted, &quot;So? It doesn&#39;t hurt to try.&quot; The young mother got up with a 
sigh. &quot;Oh please. You&#39;re facing the Living Inferno. With a name like that, I&#39;m quite sure he 
doesn&#39;t lose.&quot; Abby headed over to the kitchen, absent mindedly listening to the 
conversation in the living room.

      It was touching, really, that both Mina and Eveon were able to spend time with the 
Living Inferno. She was sure her strange guest appreciated it. He wasn&#39;t kidding when he 
said he liked kids... Abby let out another long sigh as she started to cook dinner. This was 
all a bit... weird, now that she thought about it. Here she was, allowing some complete 
stranger in, who, according to her friends, was actually the grim reaper. Or something like 
it.

      A smile touched her lips as she heard the anguished cries of Eveon and Mina. They lost 
again, predictably. 

***** 

      Mina had gone home, but not before giving Eveon a long, embarrassing kiss in front of 
everyone. Currently, Abby was sitting on the couch, watching TV for once. She had somehow 
misplaced her nameless magazine. Her ever amusing friend, the Living Inferno, was sitting on 
the loveseat, rigid as... well, a suit of armor. His rigidity was actually due in part to 
Eveon.

      The blonde girl had fallen asleep, using his lap as a pillow. Abby was sure that 
armored thighs would not make a good pillow, but hey, Eveon wasn&#39;t always known for her 
common sense. Abby could sense the awkwardness coming off of him in waves. &quot;Don&#39;t be so 
tense,&quot; she said suddenly and saw him visibly jerk out of the corner of her eye. &quot;I&#39;m not 
going to tear her away from you and call you a monster.&quot;

      He looked down at Eveon before looking over at Abby. She was attentively watching the 
program on the TV. The Living Inferno allowed one clawed hand to gently stroke Eveon&#39;s head. 
Abby wondered if this was the first time in a long time he had ever been so physically close 
to someone. It gave her a chill to look at those hands because... that armored hand of his 
was being so gentle, so careful when it brushed against Eveon. At the same time, each finger 
tapered out to a sharp tip and his hand was big enough to crush the girl&#39;s head, should he 
so wish it.

      Abby&#39;s thoughts were interrupted when the Living Inferno suddenly said, &quot;Perhaps she 
should go to bed.&quot; He looked over at Abby and there was an unspoken question left hanging in 
the air. &quot;Well, you know where her room is already... I&#39;m feeling a bit lazy.&quot; She winked at 
him and the Living Inferno, got up slowly, cradling Eveon in his arms. How her daughter 
could sleep like that would forever remain a mystery.

      She watched as he carried her daughter with such grace and care that Eveon could have 
been made of glass and be safe in his arms. Abby herself got up and walked upstairs after 
him. She watched from Eveon&#39;s doorway as he dutifully tucked her in. He turned off the 
lights, but not before running one armor clad hand over her cheek. As he exited the room, he 
let out a long, sorrowful sigh.

      Abby didn&#39;t think she&#39;d ever heard him sound so... depressed. &quot;Did you ever have 
kids?&quot; He looked over at her, but made no indication of an answer. &quot;Well, you seem like 
you&#39;d be a good parent,&quot; Abby murmured, shutting Eveon&#39;s door. &quot;I... think not...&quot; He 
answered in his raspy voice, looking down. Abby started pushing him along. &quot;Oh, whatever. I 
seriously think I&#39;ll have to keep an eye on you. Don&#39;t want you to get so charmed by Eveon 
that you&#39;ll want to kidnap her.&quot;

      He whirled around suddenly, exasperated. &quot;I would never do that!&quot; Abby just laughed. 
&quot;It&#39;s a joke! Don&#39;t you understand humor?&quot; He gave her a blank stare. &quot;I&#39;ve forsaken all my 
emotions in order to carry out my atonement.&quot; Abby just rolled her eyes and headed to her 
own room, with the Living Inferno in tow. &quot;Mm-hmm, right... which is why you were so happy 
to spend time with Eveon and Mina. You&#39;re just... I dunno. Lonely?&quot;

      He said nothing. Abby entered her room and looked back at him. &quot;Come in. I don&#39;t sleep 
well these days, so may I have your company?&quot; The Living Inferno nodded and she lied down on 
top of her bed, looking over him. He awkwardly pulled a chair over and sat down. &quot;I&#39;m happy 
you didn&#39;t make a big deal out of it, but... you don&#39;t mind that Eveon and Mina are 
lesbians?&quot;

      &quot;...no... It&#39;s love, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Abby smiled. &quot;You&#39;re a cool guy, even if your choice 
of clothing is... hmm...&quot; She reached out and grabbed his hand. The metal was cool to the 
touch and she&#39;d been right... his hand was quite large. &quot;Hey, Living Inferno.&quot; He looked 
attentively at her. &quot;You know what they say about guys with big hands?&quot;

      She only smirked at the confused look in his eyes. &quot;No, what do they say?&quot; Abby just 
stared at him and he stared back. She felt a strange shiver run down her spine and realized 
that he was looking into her mind again. The feeling abruptly stopped as his eyes widened. 
He apparently found his answer. Abby thought it much more hilarious that he actually 
searched for it in her head... that was kind of scary. &quot;It&#39;s strange... you have so much 
power and yet you&#39;re so gentle.&quot;

      He said nothing. Abby got off of the bed and let go of his hand. &quot;I&#39;m going to take a 
shower. I guess you can stay in my room if you want... or go to that other room. Are you 
going to stay the night?&quot; He nodded. &quot;If I may... I would like to.&quot; Abby let out a yawn and 
proceeded to take off her shirt. Right as she was lifting the hem of it and exposing her 
midriff, she remembered that her austere friend was still in the room.

      She looked over her shoulder and he looked over at her. They locked gazes and there 
was a bit of silence. The Living Inferno tilted his head in confusion before catching on. 
&quot;Am I invading your privacy?&quot; Abby nodded. &quot;Yeah... just a little bit, Mr. Living Inferno. I 
haven&#39;t taken my clothes off in front of guy since Terry died so...&quot; The Living Inferno, 
stood up, turned his chair around and sat back down. Abby thought the gesture was quite... 
cute. In an awkward &#39;I&#39;m-the-grim-reaper-fear-me!&#39; way.

      Abby quickly diverged herself of clothing before entering the bathroom. She started 
the water and sat on the edge of the tub. She felt happier. Maybe it was because she had 
someone to talk to? Someone like the Living Inferno didn&#39;t exactly seem to be the most 
positive person, but... she smiled to herself as she started taking a shower.

      When she exited, he was still sitting in his chair, facing away from her. &quot;It&#39;s okay 
now,&quot; Abby said, drying her hair with a towel. She tried not to laugh as he stood up, turned 
the chair back around and sat down again. She was dressed once again in shorts and tank top, 
sitting on the edge of the bed. &quot;Tell me, did you find the person you were looking for?&quot;

      The Living Inferno diverted his gaze to the ground. &quot;...yes...&quot; Abby raised a brow 
before getting up and grabbing her comb off the dresser. &quot;Alright... I&#39;m guessing you 
haven&#39;t even spoken to them, have you?&quot; He looked over at her to see her combing through her 
wet, blonde hair. He gave her an embarrassed nod.

      Abby sighed, but continued combing. &quot;Seriously, why haven&#39;t you approached them? Well, 
I know you&#39;re a bit conscious about your appearance, but I doubt they&#39;d mind after you have 
a talk with them.&quot; The Living Inferno seemed to slump in his chair. &quot;...I just... There is a 
problem. Either she will recognize me... or she won&#39;t.&quot;

      The young mother stopped combing, giving him a confused look. The Living Inferno said, 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid of her recognizing me because I would much rather protect her from the 
shadows... but, I will be disappointed and upset if she doesn&#39;t know me.&quot; Abby just let out 
a sigh. &quot;You should just speak to her and when the time is right, if she doesn&#39;t know you, 
then just... reveal yourself or however you want to do it.&quot;

      He nodded, obviously taking her advice and turning it over in his head. Abby lied back 
down on the bed, looking over at him. Some time passed and he finally looked up at her. 
&quot;I... should get going soon,&quot; he said simply. Before he could get up, she reached out and 
grabbed his hand. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be pushy, but stay? Just until I&#39;m asleep?&quot; He sat rigid, 
but no longer moved. Abby let go of his hand with a smile. &quot;I have bad insomnia. I&#39;m sure 
good company will help it.&quot;

      He gave curt nod and they passed the hours by talking of menial things. &quot; You said you 
needed to protect somebody,&quot; Abby said, suddenly. He nodded and she continued on, &quot;What do 
you need to protect them from?&quot; He took a moment before answering. &quot;There is a man out there 
willing to manipulate all those around him to gain power. The person... she is his target. I 
hope to eliminate such an evil man before he can even make contact with her.&quot;

      Abby just nodded, looking a little tired. &quot;I see...&quot; There was a bit of silence again. 
&quot;Do you ever,&quot; she murmured sadly, &quot;...feel like giving up?&quot; He just stared, silent. &quot;I 
mean, not giving up, but... after everything is said and done, do you ever feel like letting 
go and just dying?&quot; He gave a slow nod. &quot;Yes... once I&#39;ve been forgiven, perhaps... it would 
be best for me to disappear, but you... you still have a long life ahead of you.&quot;

      She just shook her head. &quot;No, not really. Once Eveon&#39;s out of the nest and flying on 
her own... I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll do. There&#39;s a big hole in my life, even with her here. I 
think, once she&#39;s gone, I may just lay down and die.&quot; She laughed a bit to herself. &quot;Kind of 
like an old dog, you know? But by then I&#39;ll only be forty or so...&quot; Suddenly, the Living 
Inferno grabbed her hand. &quot;That&#39;s not true... you&#39;ll find your purpose. Mine is to protect 
somebody and find forgiveness, yours... you&#39;ll find it. Eveon needs you.&quot;

      She gripped his hand tightly. &quot;She does, but there will come a time when I just won&#39;t 
have anything left to do for her,&quot; she giggled, &quot;It sounds like I&#39;m going to commit suicide, 
huh? I&#39;m just planning on passing away from... well, people die everyday without a purpose, 
don&#39;t they? They waste away and the world moves on.&quot; The Living Inferno said nothing. &quot;No 
worries though. I need to make sure Eveon is safe before I plan on giving up...&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t give up,&quot; he said, &quot;You&#39;ll find something. Maybe it won&#39;t be there a few years 
from now, maybe not until your sixty, but it will be there.&quot; She just smiled at him. 
&quot;Thanks... you&#39;re a great friend, you know that? Are we friends? Can I call you that?&quot; He 
nodded slowly. &quot;I think you&#39;re my only friend...&quot; He whispered in his raspy voice, but Abby 
shook her head. &quot;Nah, I&#39;m sure Eveon and Mina think of you the same way.&quot;

      He started to thank her for her kindness, but her eyes had fluttered shut and her 
breathing became slow and even. His words tapered off and he stared at her. Abby was 
sprawled on top of the bed, her head resting on the back of her hand. With as much as care 
as he had used with Eveon, the Living Inferno lifted her up and pulled back the covers. He 
carefully slid her inside, successfully tucking her in.

      He stood there, staring at her for at least five minutes. Finally, he allowed one hand 
to caress her face. It was the first time since he donned his armor that he truly wished to 
feel another.  &quot;...but sinners like me don&#39;t deserve to touch beauty with tainted hands,&quot; he 
whispered to himself, backing away and ultimately leaving Abby&#39;s house.
