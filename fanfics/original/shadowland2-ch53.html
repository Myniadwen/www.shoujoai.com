<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch52.html">Back to Part 52</a><pre>Jessica&#39;s face twisted as she tried to force back a bout of tears, &quot;You 
do not understand.&quot; Jessica stated uneasily, &quot;That house....&quot; Her eyes 
fell upon Penny, &quot;I tried to warn her. Tried to get her out of there, 
but she refused to leave.&quot; Her eyes drifted to Kim as they brimmed with 
tears, &quot;It was my fault they were being hurt so I needed to leave in 
order to save them. &quot; The tears tumbled over her eyelashes and splashing 
against her glasses, &quot;I can still feel them all over me. Touching me... 
touching her... I... I can&#39;t return there. Never....&quot; 

&quot;Oh, geez...&quot; Jenn sat heavily upon a couch.

&quot;I nearly shoved it all out of my mind.&quot; Jessica explained in a frenzy, 
&quot;I was nearly rid of those damned nightmares and then...&quot; She glanced 
angrily at Penny, &quot;Then she showed up. I knew it was her the moment she 
showed up in the lobby, but didn&#39;t want to believe it. She didn&#39;t seem 
to recognize me, but I knew it was her. I could never forget those eyes 
or that face. Every since seeing her again the nightmares have 
returned.&quot; She glanced up at Amy; &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to leave her there. I 
was young and scared.&quot; 

Amy held the girl tight, &quot;Shhh... It&#39;s alright...&quot; She soothed, &quot;They 
are not here. They can&#39;t get you anymore.&quot; 

&quot;But I can still feel them.&quot; Jessica muttered, &quot;I can still taste her 
and I liked it.&quot; She buried her face in Amy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;and I can never 
get enough...&quot;

&quot;Oh hell...&quot; Amy could not believe what she was hearing, in all her 
years of working at the Academy she had heard many stories from these 
tormented girls and yet this was something even she was not prepared to 
hear.

Jessica stared down at the bandages on her arms and shook her head in 
dismay, &quot;If only she had not come here.&quot; Jessica snapped, &quot;If she only 
stayed away I would be free of this place. I don&#39;t belong here.&quot; 

&quot;Jessie, you can&#39;t keep running away.&quot; Amy commented, &quot;It will just eat 
from the inside out. How many years have you been here?&quot;

&quot;Almost six years.&quot; Jessica replied down-heartedly while crossing her 
arms. 

&quot;And in all that time you never felt like telling anyone about your 
past?&quot; Amy gently asked. 

Jessica lowered her head, &quot;I wanted to, but...&quot; and started to rubbed 
her arms. 

&quot;But what?&quot; Amy probed, &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell us?&quot; 

&quot;Because...&quot; Jessica licked at her lips and lightly closed her eyes, 
&quot;Because you would all hate me if you knew the things I have done. 
Things I did while in that house.&quot;

Kim fell upon the mattress next to Amber, sobbing and shivering in the 
nude. 

&quot;Kimberly?!?&quot; Amber pulled the shaking girl into her arms, &quot;Kim, are you 
alright?&quot; 

&quot;She will be fine.&quot; The thin man stated with a smile, &quot;She was a very 
good girl.&quot; He reached out to touch Kim on the cheek only to have to 
girl shrink away from him. He stood up as the other man entered with 
Penny and pushed her into the room, &quot;You girls be good and don&#39;t tell 
mother or you will be punished more then anything mother could come up 
with.&quot; He threw their clothes to the ground and left the room, locking 
it behind him. 

Trembling Penny picked up their clothes and sat down on the mattress 
next to Kim. 

&quot;Penny, what happened?&quot; Amber inquired still holding Kim, &quot;What did they 
do to her? Did they touch her? Did they force her too... touch them...?&quot; 

&quot;N... no...&quot; Penny stammered and slowly shook her head. 

Sarah jumped down from her spot on the top bunk and knelt next to Penny, 
&quot;Did they make you touch her?&quot; She inquired worriedly. 

Penny curled her legs up close to her body then glanced at Kim, &quot;She 
protected me.&quot; Penny stated softly and flushed. 

Amber stared down at Kim who was sobbing uncontrollably, &quot;Kim? Hold in 
there. You have to stay strong.&quot; She soothed.

Kim wiped her mouth with the back of her hand while crying. Her eyes 
darted around the room with a look of shame upon her face. She licked at 
her lips nervously then suddenly bolted for the washroom and proceeded 
to vomit into the toilet. 

Amber got to her feet and followed the girl, &quot;Oh Kim...&quot; She lightly 
patted the girl on the back as she sat upon the edge of the tub. 

&quot;I can still taste her.&quot; Kim sobbed uncontrollably. 

Amber lightly closed her eyes and let out a sigh, &quot;I know...&quot; She agreed 
dismally. 

Kim quickly glanced up at the girl as she wiped at her mouth, the sweet 
scent from her fingers filling her nostrils and she struggled to keep 
herself from throwing up again, &quot;Y... you..?&quot; Her lips quivered and she 
tried to force herself to swallow. 

&quot;All of us.&quot; Amber stated unhappily, &quot;Even little April was forced to do 
it to Caitlin.&quot; 

Tears streamed down Kim&#39;s face, &quot;Why?&quot; The one question that circled 
through her head the entire time she was forced to have sex with Penny.

Amber shrugged, &quot;I stopped asking that years ago.&quot; She replied weakly 
and wrapped her arms around her waist, &quot;We just pray that someday we&#39;ll 
be freed of this place.&quot; 

&quot;I feel disgusting.&quot; Kim remarked looking at her hands as cum began to 
dry around her fingernails. She quickly got to her feet, turned on the 
sink faucet and grabbed the soap, vigorously scrubbing at her hands 
trying to remove that feeling from her skin.

Amber moved to the girl&#39;s side and took Kim&#39;s hands, stopping her from 
scrubbing, &quot;Try not to scrub to much. You&#39;ll only hurt yourself.&quot; She 
gently warned. 

&quot;But the smell...&quot; Kim sobbed, thinking about how much she wanted 
another taste and cried.

&quot;I know.&quot; Amber carefully washed the girl&#39;s hands for her, &quot;It&#39;s not as 
bad as the taste. It lingers with you forever.&quot; 

Kim blinked at the girl, &quot;You can still taste it?&quot; 

Amber nodded, &quot;All the time.&quot; She admitted. 

&quot;D... did you enjoy it?&quot; Kim nervously asked feeling herself trembling 
again. 

Sadness filled Amber&#39;s eyes, &quot;Not really enjoyed... but... it felt 
nice...&quot; She admitted helplessly, &quot;How about you?&quot; 

Kim rubbed at her eyes with the back of her hand and nodded, &quot;Am I 
sick?&quot; She anxiously inquired.

Amber shook her head, &quot;Those men are the sick ones.&quot; She stated firmly, 
&quot;Jessica always said it was alright to enjoy it. She was something 
special.&quot; She remarked with a sigh. 

&quot;D... did you love her?&quot; Kim asked, wanting to change the subject. 

Amber&#39;s eyes dropped to the ground, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; She turned 
around, &quot;Do you want a bath? I can fill the tub for you.&quot; 

&quot;Please.&quot; Kim nodded vigorously, she felt dirty all over and wanted to 
wash that feeling away, &quot;What about Penny?&quot; 

Amber turned on the water, &quot;Penny should be fine.&quot; She smiled at Kim, 
&quot;After all it was you who she was with and not one of those guys.&quot;

Kim flushed the toilet, &quot;I only wanted to protect her.&quot; She stated 
uneasily. 

&quot;You are a lot like Jessie you know.&quot; Amber leaned close to Kim&#39;s ear, 
&quot;I know you love her.&quot; She whispered, &quot;I can see it in your eyes.&quot; 

&quot;I... I...&quot; Kim stammered in embarrassment. 

&quot;Get in the tub.&quot; Amber directed, &quot;I&#39;ll check on Penny for you and don&#39;t 
worry. I&#39;m sure she feels the same for you.&quot; She began to leave the room 
when Kim spun around. 

&quot;Amber!&quot; Kim called out. 

Amber stopped at the door, &quot;Yeah?&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Kim said with a weak smile. 

&quot;What are sisters for right?&quot; Amber remarked then left the room.
