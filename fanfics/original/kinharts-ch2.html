<a href="../original/kinharts-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Fond Memories

	Kylie and Eric sat in my room with me for almost 6 hours. We 
talked about memories, Keiko&#39;s stubbornness, the time left until the 
year&#39;s lessons started, and we tried to move forward with our lives, for 
Keiko&#39;s memory. &#39;I will always love you, my angel.&#39; Kylie and Eric bid 
me farewell as they parted to get their rest.  Shortly after they left, 
I started thinking about my favorite memories of Keiko, my missing 
angel.
	&#39;The memories I cherish most, is they day we met, and the day our 
circle became whole.&quot; I close my eyes and think about those two days, 
and it brings a soft smile to my face. I replay the day I met you first.
--------------------------
	Eric, Kylie, and I had just finished our &#39;History of the Magi&#39; 
double lesson and it was my off period. &#39;Might as well get some of my 
assignments out of the way.&#39; I ascended thee stairs and made a beeline 
for the school library. I was too lost in thought to notice someone walk 
in front of me.
	&quot;Oh, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot; You had said. &quot;I really wasn&#39;t paying 
attention to where I was going.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s quite a1right,&quot; I replied jovially. &quot;I must admit that I am 
just as guilty as you are. My name is Aimee Reynolds. What is yours?&quot;
	At that moment, I lifted my head, and found myself gazing into the 
most beautiful set of amethyst-colored eyes I had ever seen. I found 
myself slightly inebriated, and quite lost in their depth.
	&quot;Natsuhiro, Keiko,&quot; came her reply.
	&quot;What ...?&quot; I mumbled
	&quot;Oh, right. It&#39;s Keiko, Keiko Natsuhiro,&quot; She said again, not 
noticing my dazed state of being.
	Recovering from my stupor, I managed to reply in a coherent 
sentence. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s nice to meet you Keiko.&quot;
	&quot;Ditto, where exactly are you headed?&quot; Keiko asked.
	&quot;Oh, I&#39;m uh ... on my way to the library to do work on my History 
homework,&quot; I replied.
	&quot;Really!? I was going to do the same, after I got a completely 
unhealthy and totally fattening lunch. Would you care to join me?&quot; You 
asked sweetly
	&quot;Sure, I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; I replied.
	During lunch and afterwards, at the library, I couldn&#39;t help but 
eye your body. I had guessed that you stood about 5&#39;5&quot; and noticed that 
you were a little slimmer than me. Your waist and hips were accentuated 
by the tight fitting pants you loved wearing, just to entice me. Your 
legs were long and slender, and were well toned. You often tossed that 
long, shiny raven hair of yours over your shoulders, as though you 
wanted to toy with me. Those deep, amethyst eyes nearly made me melt 
every time you looked at me. I was totally mesmerized by your goddess 
given beauty.
---------------------------
	Eventually, it dawned on me that you hadn&#39;t run into me on 
accident. Sly little you had orchestrated the entire afternoon. I gave 
another smile at the thought. &quot;You&#39;d been after me for a while, and I 
hadn&#39;t even noticed.&#39; That day led to a fast friendship, and you and I 
became really close. Even though you were in half of my classes, you 
hadn&#39;t really met Kylie and Eric, so I introduced them later, on 
another, rather interesting day.
----------------------------
       &quot;Keiko, I want you to meet my two best friends today. I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ll all get along great,&quot; I said during one of our afternoons in the 
school&#39;s lounge.
	&quot;I think that would be nice,&quot; Keiko beamed. &quot;If they are like you, 
we are sure to become the best of friends. And I&#39;ll get to know more of 
your little personal quirks too.&quot;
	&quot;You wouldn&#39;t ... would you?&quot; I asked, more than knowing the 
answer. All I got was a mischievous grin in response.
	I knew that if she asked, they would list off ALL of the little 
things I did that they found funny. I would probably be embarrassed for 
days. As we made plans to set up the day, I couldn&#39;t help but imagine 
what Keiko would do when Kylie told her my biggest and most embarrassing 
foul up. My faced flushed a bright crimson and I moaned with dread.
----------------------------
	I remember going to the town&#39;s plaza for a small shopping bender 
before going to meet them that day. We had agreed to meet at a popular 
Burger Palace near Kylie&#39;s, parents&#39; house. Keiko and I got there early 
and decided to wait for the couple to wander in. While we were waiting, 
I managed to notice Keiko eyeing me. I followed her gaze as she slowly 
looked over my trim legs, the curve of my hips, up the flatness of my 
stomach, over the modest swell of my breasts, and slowly up to my lips. 
I watched, letting her gaze on as she observed my lips as I spoke to 
her. Then, when you looked directly into my hazel eyes, our conversation 
ceased completely. We were both too wrapped up in each others eyes for 
the forgotten conversation to go on.
	&quot;You won&#39;t need to worry if they are all over each other; they&#39;ve 
been together for almost a year now,&quot; I warned you, regretfully breaking 
the moment.
	&quot;I figured that one of you was dating Eric,&quot; You answered coolly.
	&quot;And how did you come to that conclusion?&quot; I asked warily.
	&quot;It was fairly obvious,&quot; You said rolling your eyes and tossing 
your hair.
	&quot;Oh it was, was it?&quot; I quipped.
	&quot;Of course,&quot; You replied, giggling. &quot;Two girls and one guy? He had 
to go for one of you at some point.&quot;
	I looked at you for a long second before brushing the whole thing 
off. At the moment, I was completely oblivious to your now obvious 
underlying hints and plans. I would soon figure out why you had smiled 
so widely at me afterwards. I resumed a small conversation, just to pass 
the time.
       Ten more minutes pass as we talked, and you soon began wondering 
where those two were. I took a second or two to think, but, being their 
best friend, only one conclusion came to mind. I gave a faint smirk and 
waved it off.
	&quot;Why haven&#39;t they come yet?&quot; You asked, a little impatiently. 
&quot;They should have been here already right?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, but, unfortunately, I know them too well NOT to know that 
they&#39;ll be late, somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 minutes,&quot; I said 
giving her a look. She just eyed me for a second before it dawned on 
her.
	&quot;OH ... I see, I see. Ok then,&quot; you said with a faint blush.
	We talked a little more while waiting for about another fifteen or 
so minutes. We had begun to discuss all of the self-absorbed, pigheaded 
people at the school when Kylie came through the door breathless.
	&quot;Sorry we&#39;re late Aimee,&quot; Kylie said between breaths. &quot;Eric and I 
got a little ... um ... sidetracked.&quot;
&quot;We figured,&quot; We said together. 
&quot;It&#39;s cool though, Keiko and I had some real bonding time,&quot; I laughed
	&quot;Good, cause I was worried.&quot; Eric said, sporting his cool guy 
charm.
	&quot;Hey guys, this is Keiko Natsuhiro,&quot; I said pointing to Keiko. 
&quot;Keiko, this is Kylie Asano and Eric Sargoza.&quot; 
	&quot;It&#39;s good to finally meet you Keiko,&quot; Eric said kindly. &quot;Aimee 
has told us all about you.&quot;
	&quot;She has been asking us to meet you for almost two weeks now &quot; 
Kylie added jokingly. &quot;It&#39;s as if she wants us to meet the love of her 
life, and give some sort fo approval. It&#39;s really interesting to listen 
to her talk about you so often.&quot;
	&quot;Oh really?&quot; Keiko responded casting a look of intrigue at me. 
&quot;It&#39;s good to finally meet you as well. Aimee tells me you two are her 
best friends.&quot;
	&quot;Ha ... yeah ...&quot; I giggled nervously. &quot;Let&#39;s get some food guys.&quot;
	&quot;What&#39;s the rush Aimee?&quot; Eric asked, casting a suspicious glance. 
&quot;Nervous or something? We&#39;ve got all the time in the world.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah Aimee, nervous?&quot; Kylie inquired grinning.
	&quot;No!&quot; I replied blushing.
	&quot;You are,&quot; you giggled, &quot;and ... you&#39;re blushing. About what I 
wonder. Are you hiding something from us?&quot;
	&quot;Uh ... heh ... no ...&quot; I hesitated. &quot;Why would I hide something?&quot;
	&quot;Maybe ... you have a crush on someone?&quot; Eric smiled. &quot;Let&#39;s take 
a guess at who it could be. I suppose it&#39;s one of us here.&quot;
	&quot;Hmm ... now who could it be?&quot; Kylie asked sarcastically. &quot;Maybe, 
just maybe, it&#39;s Keiko.&quot;
	&quot;Me!?&quot; You sputtered, completely surprised. &quot;How could she have a 
crush on me?&quot;
	&quot;You mean to say that Aimee hasn&#39;t told you?&quot; Eric asked, 
confused.
	&quot;Told me what?&quot; you responded, still quite surprised. &quot;What hasn&#39;t 
she told me?&quot;
	&quot;She&#39;s Bi,&quot; Kylie said bluntly, her softest voice. &quot;She isn&#39;t too 
open about it though.&quot;
	&quot;I didn&#39;t tell her, because I didn&#39;t want her to be afraid that I 
might fall for her,&quot; I growled.
	&quot;It&#39;s alright Aimee,&quot; you whispered. &quot;I am glad you didn&#39;t tell me 
before. I wasn&#39;t quite sure if I was right, but I know now.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot; I asked, intrigued.
	&quot;I&#39;ve been watching everything you do for a good while,&quot; you said 
seriously. &quot;I noticed that many times, you were attracted more towards 
the girls you met than the guys. I was a little surprised at first, but 
then, I planned the whole little bumping into each other, and then made 
sure that the rest of the day worked out in this favor.&quot;
	&quot;I knew it!&quot; I shouted triumphantly. &quot;It&#39;s not like you haven&#39;t 
been doing the same though.&quot;
	&quot;Guilty as charged,&quot; Keiko confessed. &quot;I must admit though; I&#39;ve 
paid more attention to you than any other girl I&#39;ve seen.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you captain obvious, my name is Eric.&quot; Eric 
joked.
	&quot;Don&#39;t be a jerk Eric,&quot; Kylie said slapping him on the back of his 
head.
	&quot;OW! That hurt Kylie,&quot; Eric whined.
	&quot;Good,&quot; the three girls giggled.
	&quot;Enough pleasantries,&quot; Keiko interrupted. &quot;I need to eat.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah!&quot; I agreed. &quot;I haven&#39;t eaten at all today.&quot;
	We went up and ordered our food and then Kylie, you, and I found a 
seat and started chattering on like high school girls. After Eric 
brought the food; we started talking about me again. We ate while we 
chatted, and Eric and Kylie continued to share my little quirky secrets 
with you, even without request. When we finally stopped talking, the 
four of us parted ways. I walked you home because my car was in the shop 
and we wanted to have more time to let the day slow down. 
----------------------------
	We got involved in deep conversation on our way to your campus 
house. We had started to talk about our tendencies and the enjoyment we 
shared staring at other women. We discussed several girls that we liked.
	&quot;Are you interested in me?&quot; You asked boldly, catching me off 
guard.
	&quot;Uh ...well ...&quot; I blushed, &quot;I ... I, uh ... yes, yes I am.&quot;
	&quot;Do you think I&#39;m pretty?&quot; You asked, gazing into my eyes 
expectantly.
	&quot;Pretty is and understatement,&quot; I said bluntly, returning her 
stare. &quot;You are astonishingly beautiful, and that&#39;s the truth.&quot;
	&quot;Thank you,&quot; Keiko said, lowering her head. &quot;Aimee, can you 
promise me something?&quot;
	&quot;Anything, you just have to name it,&quot; I answered quickly, and 
honestly.
	&quot;I ... I want you to promise me that ... that you will always tell 
me the truth,&quot; you said quietly.
	&quot;Yes, of course, as long as you promise me that you will never 
abandon our friendship,&quot; I replied seriously.
	&quot;I would never abandon you, or our friendship, but ... I was 
hoping, that we could expand on that friendship,&quot; you said placing her 
soft hand on my shoulder.
	&quot;I was thinking the same thing,&quot; I replied truthfully.
	We took a hesitant glance into each other&#39;s eyes, and then took 
the leap of faith. Our lips drew close, and our breaths grew shallow in 
anticipation. I remember losing all thought the instant you sweet lips 
touched mine. I could only focus on the pure elation I felt within the 
moment our kiss lasted. We parted, our breaths coming out short.
	&quot;Wow...&quot; I sighed touching my lips.
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Keiko whispered.
----------------------------------

Kaiton&#39;s Afterthoughts:
	Okay, I wanted to show a drop into how the four became friends, 
and as how to the way Keiko&#39;s and Aimee&#39;s relationship came to be. There 
will be plenty of lovey-dovey scenes coming, and a surprise hits early 
next chapter. Thanks for reading. And send me a review already!!! For 
Goddess&#39; Light too you meanies!
