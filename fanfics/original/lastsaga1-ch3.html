PART THREE
**********

&quot;What did you mean by that?!&quot; Rain barked angrily, &quot;Destroy the world?!&quot;

The wizened sage known as Mr. Oro crossed his arms behind his back and 
smiled at the Princess of Souru-Kai. While Teela and Gatou observed him 
curiously. They were still confused as to how this old man knew so much 
about them and what was going on with the Seraphic Maiden. She seemed to 
know a lot more about things than he was letting on. 

Mr. Oro chuckled. &quot;Ah. I can see that you have much of your father&#39;s 
fire inside of you. That will serve you well in the future, my dear.&quot;

&quot;Answer the question!&quot; Rain shot back, &quot;What did you mean by that?&quot;

&quot;It cannot be the first time you&#39;ve heard it. I understand that you had 
a bit of a scuffle with the sorceress Branwen Kalia Mortiria a few weeks 
ago? Right before the Seraphic Maiden appeared? Did she not tell you 
that using the Atama sword against her would be disastrous?&quot;

Rain blinked. &quot;She did. But what does that have to do with anything? And 
how would you even know about that?&quot;

&quot;I have my ways,&quot; Mr. Oro said, &quot;And to answer your question, I will 
fully explain. You see, you wield something called the Atama sword. It 
is very powerful in the right hands. However it once was even more 
powerful. It had a mass of energy inside of it called the Ortega. Which, 
in some respects, is the &#39;soul&#39; of the blade. But the two were broken 
asunder in a battle which has long since faded from human memory. A 
battle between the first king of the Souru-Kai, Anshiva, and the 
previous Ashidah. The battle was great and costly. When Anshiva struck 
the Ashidah with the fully-powered Atama sword, the energy generated was 
immense. One that both killed the Ashidah and unhinged the foundations 
of the earth. Wounding it so badly that thousands of Metanim had to be 
summoned from across the world to heal the lesion before it meant total 
doom for the people of the earth. They were successful. And though it 
was not Anshiva&#39;s fault, he still held himself to blame. He took his own 
life with the Atama sword after the healing of the world. Those events 
eventually became known as the Day of the Apocalypse. And Anshiva Palace 
was built in the king&#39;s honour. Most people have forgotten what happened 
then. But to prevent something like that from ever happening again, the 
sword had its soul removed from it, limiting its power. Then the Atama 
sword, the body, was entrusted to the strongest warrior class of that 
time, the Souru-Kai. While the Ortega, the soul, was given to the most 
skilled Metanim bloodline of that time. The Mortiria Family. It was 
decreed that the two weapons would never meet again. Joining or fusing 
their existences after the Day of the Apocalypse would have caused the 
same tragedy.&quot;

Gatou nodded. &quot;I see. So re-fusing the Atama and the Ortega would 
generate enough energy to eliminate the White Devil. But the energy born 
of doing that would threaten the stability of the world.&quot;

&quot;Correct. You&#39;re not all muscle are you, Kahn Gatou?&quot;

The master swordsman coughed into his fist with a smile, while Teela&#39;s 
face showed a lot more concern. &quot;But I don&#39;t get it! If we can&#39;t use 
that way of killing the Seraphic Maiden then what are we supposed to do? 
Just let it stomp around the world and kill everyone? That thing was 
once my sister! I didn&#39;t know her well... but I can feel that she was a 
good person! She wouldn&#39;t want that thing to be doing all this!&quot;

Mr. Oro chuckled once more. &quot;And once again, you children ask me the 
wrong questions. I said that the Seraphic Maiden cannot be killed by the 
use of that method. But I did not say that it could not be stopped.&quot;

Rain, Gatou and Teela now paid full attention. But Rain was the very 
first of them to speak. &quot;Are you saying that... you might know of a way 
to stop the Seraphic Maiden? Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Of course I am,&quot; Mr. Oro said, &quot;Old Adepts like myself never lie. But 
before I tell you of that method, I must explain a few other things to 
you so that you understand the situation fully. That woman you met 
before, her name is Branwen Kalia Mortiria. She is the daughter of Allen 
and Sophia Mortiria. And the rightful owner of the Ortega. When she was 
born, Allen was a member of the Black Metanim. He served directly under 
the God King himself, Saul. But Allen grew resentful of his own lack of 
power. From this resentment and jealousy came anger. And from that anger 
came the will to dominate the Western Empire. But Allen was not a fool. 
He knew that he was not strong enough to defeat God King Saul&#39;s armies 
on his own. So on the eve of the anniversary of the Day of the 
Apocalypse, Allen took up Ortega and began to tap into the dark arts of 
magic. Allen grew to be even more powerful than he once was. No longer 
Allen Mortiria; he became something that was far different. He became 
Sunderarajan, the Demonic Metanim. When Sophia discovered what Allen was 
doing she hurried to stop it. She stole away the Ortega and broke 
Sunderarajan&#39;s connection to the dark way. Thus ceasing the flow of 
negative energy into his body. Leaving him incomplete. Sophia tried to 
reason with Sunderarajan. To make him see that invoking this sort of 
power was dangerous to himself and others. But he would not listen in 
that state. And he attacked Sophia. She would have been killed by him. 
But then she used her powers to send Sunderarajan into something called 
the Instrumental Rapture. Which is a small alternate dimension created 
by the Mortiria Family for unknown reasons. Sunderarajan was locked away 
and his plans to take over the Western Empire were foiled. Sophia then 
decided that the Ortega was too powerful to be used. And so she buried 
it inside the Shrine of the Ancient Ones, a set of ruins which are 
nestled inside the very heart of the Siren&#39;s Forest.&quot;

Teela sighed, shoulders sagging. &quot;And how is ANY of that important?&quot;

&quot;Do you not see, child?&quot; Mr. Oro questioned, &quot;The Seraphic Maiden cannot 
be killed without doing serious damage to the world. But it could still 
be imprisoned. Sealed away inside of the Instrumental Rapture.&quot; 

Teela then pulled a smile. &quot;Hey! He&#39;s right! If we could find a way to 
get the Seraphic Maiden inside of this Instrumental Rapture thingie; we 
would get rid of it without even having to fight it!&quot;

&quot;Alright then,&quot; Rain spoke, &quot;Lets do it.&quot;

&quot;Hold your horses, Princess,&quot; Mr. Oro smirked, looking downwards, &quot;It is 
not as simple as that. You see Sophia was the last person to have 
knowledge of the magical spell that seals things inside the Instrumental 
Rapture from an external position. For me to trap the Seraphic Maiden 
within Instrumental Rapture, I would need to be inside of it myself. And 
more importantly, only one being can be sealed in that place at any 
given time. Which means...&quot;

Gatou answered this time. &quot;Sunderarajan. He would still be inside of the 
Instrumental Rapture, would he not?&quot;

&quot;Right again, Kahn Gatou,&quot; Claimed the shorter man, &quot;For us to seal the 
Seraphic Maiden inside the Instrumental Rapture, I would not only need 
to perform the spell from its innards, we would have to kill 
Sunderarajan.&quot;

Rain narrowed her eyes. &quot;How strong is this Sunderarajan? Is he as 
powerful as the Seraphic Maiden is?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Answered Mr. Oro, &quot;Seraphic Maiden is far more formidable. Even 
so, Sunderarajan will still be VERY dangerous. But as you know, the only 
way to stop the Seraphic Maiden is to place it inside of the 
Instrumental Rapture. So I believe that we really have no choice in the 
matter.&quot;

Gatou grinned, socking his fist into his palm. &quot;Fine then! All we have 
to do is enter the Instrumental Rapture, kill Sunderarajan and then seal 
the White Devil into it!&quot;

Mr. Oro chuckled yet again in that way of his. &quot;I admire your zeal, Kahn 
Gatou. But there is also the issue of getting to the Instrumental 
Rapture.&quot;

&quot;How do we get there?&quot; Teela asked.

&quot;The physical gateway to Instrumental Rapture is called the Inferno 
Gate. It is based on top of a building known as Qinghua Tower. And 
Qinghua Tower was built on an island in the middle of the Great Sea.&quot;

Rain sighed miserably. &quot;So we&#39;d have to sail there?&quot;

&quot;No, no, no.&quot; Mr. Oro assured, &quot;I can get you there myself. This Grand 
Library holds many secrets and one of them is the Teleportation Chamber. 
I can take you straight to the island upon which Qinghua Tower exists. 
But there is still one other problem.&quot;

&quot;Another problem?&quot; Rain whined, &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I do not think that you, I and Gatou alone can defeat Sunderarajan. I 
think that we need more. We need the woman who has the deepest 
connection to him, the wielder of the Ortega. We need Branwen Kalia 
Mortiria.&quot;

Gatou growled. &quot;That arrogant witch?! She was the one who created the 
White Devil in the first place! How could we even trust her, knowing all 
that she had done!?&quot;

&quot;She was blinded by love,&quot; Mr. Oro said softly, &quot;Mia Bannockburn was 
taken from Branwen unfairly; even though Mia&#39;s Father did do the right 
thing. Branwen is to blame for her own actions, but surely you can have 
sympathy? It is the cruelty of fate. And I know that she will help us.&quot;

Rain thought about this. &quot;She was quite strong. But we don&#39;t know where 
she is right now. How would we even find her?&quot;

Mr. Oro pulled a toothy grin. &quot;You leave that to me, Princess Rain.&quot;

**********

Branwen and Baja flew over the skies of the coastal grasslands towards 
that untouched village. They would deal with the Seraphic Maiden issue 
after getting some sleep in them. But there was little either of them 
could do to stop the Unholy Angel. What could fight a creature like 
that? Branwen did not pay the idea any mind. And she concentrated on 
getting herself and Baja to the village. That was, until she heard a 
voice.

{...Branwen...}

The woman in question stopped in the air, lowering the magical sphere 
that was moving herself and Baja to the village. She hovered in the air 
and looked around for the owner of that voice. As did Baja. But the old 
bird couldn&#39;t help but feel a tingle of familiarity from the mysterious 
voice.

Branwen&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Who is that? Who&#39;s out there?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Baja mused, &quot;Where have I heard that voice before...?&quot;

&quot;You know the owner of that voice, Baja?&quot; Asked the Ortega-wielder. 

Baja nodded to her. &quot;I think so.&quot;

Then again came the foreign, distant voice. {The two of you look well. I 
am glad for that. And Sophia would have been particularly proud of how 
far you have come, Branwen. Even though you haven&#39;t always made the best 
choices in life, Sophia always predicted that great things from you.}

Whoever this guy was, Branwen noted that he was familiar with her 
Mother. But now Baja knew exactly who that voice belonged to. &quot;..I can&#39;t 
believe it! After all these years! Master Oro!&quot; 

Branwen looked at Baja. &quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Master Oro,&quot; Baja replied from his little beak, &quot;He was a good friend 
of your late mother&#39;s. He was the one to teach her all of her arts. And 
he schooled me on all the prophecies and scriptures of the ancients that 
he felt I was ready for. He did not spend much time with your mother and 
I in the Western Empire, only about five or six years, but he is 
exceptionally knowledgeable in the ways of the world and magic.&quot;

{You give me too much credit, Baja,} Mr. Oro&#39;s voice said aloud, 
{However a situation has arisen. You know that the Seraphic Maiden, that 
which used to be Mia, is on a destructive campaign that threatens to 
consume even more lives that it already has. We have come up with a plan 
to stop the Seraphic Maiden. But we need your help, Branwen.}

Branwen sneered, &quot;I just assisted the Western Empire in carrying out 
some half-baked scheme to stop Mia. It was a total failure. What makes 
your plan any different? And why should I even begin to trust you?&quot;

{Well I cannot make you trust me. But I can tell you this. This mission 
is relevant to your past. If you wish to know the actual realities 
behind the disappearance of your father, I can explain them to you. And 
in helping us to carry out our plan, you can settle your guilt and end 
the rampage of the Seraphic Maiden forever.}

Branwen crossed her arms. &quot;You truly know of my Father?&quot;

{Yes,} Mr. Oro said, {What you wish to learn from me will come even if 
you help us or not. I will not mimic the Western Empire and blackmail 
you into something you&#39;d rather not be involved in. But we could use 
your help in this matter.}

&quot;We?&quot;

Mr. Oro&#39;s voice spoke up again. {That is correct. Me and those that will 
help in stopping the Seraphic Maiden. Princess Rain of the Souru-Kai, 
Kahn Gatou and Teela Bannockburn. We are at Anshiva Palace. If you wish 
to help us then we would welcome that help with open arms.}

Branwen picked her brain for an answer. This probably wasn&#39;t a trap. 
This Oro man did not seem the type for something like that. And Rain and 
Teela also seemed rather trustworthy, in the brief five minutes Branwen 
had met with them. She turned her eyes to Baja again.

&quot;Can I trust him?&quot; She asked. 

Baja bobbed his little head up and down. &quot;Of course. Master Oro was a 
good man, if not a little eccentric. I would trust him with my life in 
even the worst of situations.&quot;

Well the Dark Sorceress still wasn&#39;t sure about the guy. But she trusted 
Baja&#39;s judgement. If he had faith in Mr. Oro, then Branwen believed that 
she could too. &quot;Alright then. I&#39;ll help you.&quot;

Mr. Oro&#39;s voice acknowledged that. {Good.}

There was no point in dragging this out. Branwen shut her eyes and 
focused the power of the Ortega. She didn&#39;t like to teleport between 
such great distances but there was little choice she had in the matter. 
The bright plum-coloured glow encircled her and Baja once more. Then in 
the blink of an eye, they both vanished. Leaving behind only a strolling 
wind over the skies of the coastal region.

**********

&quot;I see...&quot;

It didn&#39;t take long for Mr. Oro to retell the story of what happened to 
Sunderarajan/Allen Mortiria. Branwen digested it all with a rather 
unmoving expression of understanding on her face. She had never been to 
familiar with her father. He had disappeared when she was a young girl. 
But it did comfort her to know that she at last had the understanding of 
what happened to him. And Baja was pleased that Branwen had finally been 
told of those events. He had promised Sophia that he would not tell 
Branwen the truth about Allen and his sealing inside the Instrumental 
Rapture. But he did feel that Branwen deserved to know the truth about 
both of her parents. In this way the Dark Sorceress had gained that 
knowledge without Baja breaking his promise to Sophia. 

Branwen, Baja, Mr. Oro, Rain, Teela and Gatou had all be gathered in the 
large hall of the Grand Library. And Branwen had been told everything of 
their plan to stop the Seraphic Maiden once and for all. Gatou and Rain 
were still mistrusting of her, but for now they held those feelings 
back. The mission was all that mattered now. And there was only one 
question remaining that Branwen needed to answer before they carried it 
all out. 

Mr. Oro asked it. &quot;So Branwen. Do you understand the significance of all 
this? If we go to Qinghua Tower, pass through the Inferno Gate and enter 
the very seat of the Instrumental Rapture, you will have to help us to 
defeat and kill Sunderarajan. It is selfish and cruel of me to ask this. 
Because that being was once your Father. But-&quot;

Branwen cut him off. &quot;It&#39;s fine. I have no emotions towards him. I was 
raised by my Mother and Baja. Killing him is in no way beyond me. All I 
care about now is stopping Mia. I owe her that much for causing all this 
agony.&quot;

Mr. Oro smiled at her, nodding his head. &quot;I can see that you are 
maturing into a fine woman. I know that you will have made Sophia proud 
in your own way. Now. We must go to Qinghua Tower immediately. I can 
sense that the Seraphic Maiden is currently laying waste to the town of 
Jumah.&quot;

Gatou shook his fist with anticipation. &quot;Then what are we waiting for!? 
Lead us to these so-called Teleportation Chambers!&quot;

Mr. Oro nodded to the Kahn and ordered them all to follow him. He walked 
around the many bookcases of the Grand Library with the others in tow. 
When they came to a far wall, Mr. Oro pressed a loose stone back into 
the wall. That particular section of the wall parted slowly and loudly 
to reveal a new hallway. The gang followed Mr. Oro when he strode down 
that hallway and came to a new room. The wise sage opened the door to 
that new room by touching a magical runic symbol on the side of that 
wooden door. It opened for him. And then they all entered. Into a far 
larger room than that of even the Grand Library. Rain, Teela and Gatou 
gasped at the size of this place. It was a gargantuan chamber built of 
stone. On the floors of the Teleportation Chambers were ancient ruins 
symbols carved as art work by the original creators of this place. Just 
as the ceiling was. Into the walls of this room were stone archways. 
They were made as extensions from the stone itself. But inside them were 
swirling masses of energy. Which they could all see acted as portals. 
There were at least 500 of these portals built into the walls of the 
Teleportation Chamber. From this place, you could go to almost anywhere 
in the world in the mere blink of an eye. 

Rain was astounded. &quot;Amazing. There is so much about this Palace that I 
still have yet to learn, isn&#39;t there?&quot;

&quot;Correct, Princess Rain,&quot; Mr. Oro agreed, &quot;And recognizing that is the 
first step towards truly knowing what you&#39;ll inherit when you become 
Queen of the Souru-Kai Tribe.&quot;

&quot;Which portal leads to the Island of Qinghua Tower?&quot; Baja asked. 

Mr. Oro pointed to a distant one on the far left. He and the others 
walked over to it. And one by one they all passed through the portal in 
its stone archway. Until they were all gone. 

**********

The waves of the Great Sea crashed against the small shores of a remote 
island. Crabs scuttled by the beach alongside seaweed. Seagulls sung 
from above, in the air. The unbound sun shone its light down on a 
peaceful place free from humanity and the struggles they were suffering 
with; against the Seraphic Maiden. Then a loud sound disturbed the 
serenity of the scene. A sparkling, circular energy materialized on the 
beach. A portal. And soon people began to leap out from it and onto the 
golden sands of the beach. One by one they came. First Mr. Oro, then 
Branwen and Baja, Rain, Teela and finally Gatou. The portal remained in 
place even after the exited it. And thus the group had been brought to 
the very island of Qinghua Tower. 

They all looked up as Mr. Oro pointed to it, no more than fifty metres 
from their location. It was a reasonably tall tower built with both 
stone and metal to form something utterly unique. Possessed of 
crenulations, angular extending roof points and a faint red glow at its 
top. That which had to be the Inferno Gate. 

Mr. Oro introduced it. &quot;This is Qinghua Tower. Not even I know how or 
why it was built. But I do know that the Mortiria Family created the 
Inferno Gate in it because they knew it would be safe here. Very few 
people have actually been inside of the Instrumental Rapture. They 
wanted to keep it that way.&quot;

&quot;Lets keep moving.&quot; Rain suggested.

They all nodded and started the march to Qinghua Tower. It did not take 
long to reach there. By crossing over the beach and what little grass 
that was there. Mr. Oro had actually been underestimating the smallness 
of the place. The island could have been no more than two hundred metres 
in total diameter. Even so, the group came to the doors of the tower. 
Mr. Oro made an ancient incantation pass through his lips and the metal 
doors soon opened thereafter. They all walked inside and marvelled at 
the antediluvian tower. It was adorned with old artwork from a bygone 
civilization that had ceased to be a part of modern memory. These 
artworks showed conflicts between great creatures such as Shrike and 
Dragons. Human beings were also pictured there, but with an air of 
powerlessness, beneath the iron fists of monsters. But at even higher 
status than the monsters were the gods. Old images of the Lords of 
Reality, such as the Earth Goddess Serene, the Goddess of Love and War, 
Ishu, the Thunder Goddess Divinity, the Goddess of Darkness Aeraph, the 
God of Death Necros, the Water God Zaiki, the Fire God Nai, and most 
importantly, the Light God Onreld; who was king of the Gods and master 
of all creation. Such artwork showed the importance of the Gods and the 
worship of them to past civilizations.

The group all took note of what they were seeing but kept moving. 
Following Mr. Oro as he led them up a flight of stairs that spiralled up 
the tower. And the further they got up Qinghua Tower, the more that the 
images of the paintings changed. Six-winged images became prevalent. 
Which they all knew were the ancestors of the Seraphic Maiden. It seemed 
that more and more of them existed in the past. Strangely enough; the 
pictures seemed to show that there was conflict between the Gods and the 
ancient Seraphic Maidens. But this conflict was evenly matched. If what 
was painted on these walls was true, then the Seraphic Maidens, the 
fully-evolved forms of the Ashidah, were on equal terms with the Gods 
themselves. Which perhaps made it easier to understand why they were so 
powerful and feared. While climbing up the tower, Branwen took glimpses 
at Teela. She remembered that she actually caused the girl great pain in 
taking Mia&#39;s soul from her. And yet Teela did not seem to bare her any 
resentment. 

Then Teela noticed that Branwen was staring at her. &quot;Is something 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;...You look a great deal like your sister did,&quot; Branwen stated simply, 
&quot;She was a beautiful woman. Very kind. Very caring. You&#39;ve grown up to 
be very much alike with her.&quot; 

Teela pulled a small smile. &quot;You loved her very much, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I did. I couldn&#39;t handle losing her. I lost my mother when I was 
young and I never knew what became of my father until today. All I&#39;ve 
had in my life were my memories. That and Baja. When I finally found 
Mia, I just couldn&#39;t stand the thought of losing something else I cared 
about. So I fled from the South to the West and became a Black Metanim. 
Not to serve Saul, but to help me find a way of bringing Mia back. I had 
no idea of the problems I would unleash.&quot;

&quot;Well, now you have your chance to make things better. I&#39;m sure that my 
sister would have wanted it that way.&quot;

Branwen nodded. And the group kept moving. Ever upwards. Until the stair 
led to an opening to the outside. Beams of light came from that opening. 
They were quite close. Mr. Oro was followed by the rest when he walked 
through that opening. And the found themselves walking up a smaller set 
of stairs that had been built on the outside of Qinghua Tower. Giving a 
clear view of the soft blue seas surrounding the island. And a few 
minutes later those stairs led them to the very top of Qinghua Tower. 
The group stopped and took note of their surroundings. In the centre of 
the roof stood the Inferno Gate. A red and unattached version of the 
stone archways in the Teleportation Chamber of Anshiva Palace. The 
portal inside it was very much active. But beside the Inferno Gate were 
two tall stone statues. One was armed with a spiked club and the other 
with a mace. They seemed harmless enough but both Mr. Oro and Baja knew 
better. They were the Guardians of the Inferno Gate. El Kholti and Al 
Kaheotl. Both made by the Mortiria Family to protect the entrance into 
the Instrumental Rapture. Their eyes lit up when the group approached 
the Inferno Gate. 

Mr. Oro became alert. &quot;Beware of those statues. They will attempt to 
prevent us from entering the Instrumental Rapture.&quot;

&quot;This is not a problem. My girls have been calling out for an adversary 
for far too long.&quot; Gatou said aggressively. 

He reached down and gripped the hilt of Sahara, unsheathed it, and then 
charged for El Kholti. The stone giant lifted its spiked club and 
brought it back down. Gatou dodged to one side of the attack. The club 
smashed the stone of the floor in that very instant. Leaving behind a 
large dent. But that didn&#39;t intimidate Gatou. He ran forwards again at 
the ankles of the tall stone apparition. With one smooth rushing motion 
he sliced through its legs. The stone titan cried out with a ghostly 
scream and toppled over, smashing to pieces. 

Al Kaheotl was left to fend for itself. It slowly marched towards the 
gang, not taking any real note of El Kholti&#39;s death. This time Branwen 
took the fight to the stone monster. But without the Ortega. She simply 
pressed out her hand evenly. Gathered up her strength. And then fired an 
amethyst tone blast of crystal-like energy. Al Kaheotl let off a scream 
of its own when struck with that single blast. It stumbled back on its 
feet and fell down to the ground, shattering into pieces. 

&quot;Well that&#39;s that.&quot; Declared Gatou, sheathing Sahara. 

Rain nodded, then looked over to the Inferno Gate. &quot;We can&#39;t waste 
anymore time. Lets go.&quot;

&quot;Wait a moment.&quot; Mr. Oro said haltingly. 

Rain looked back at him. &quot;What&#39;s the problem?&quot;

In a word, Teela. The old sage looked over at the southern girl with a 
worried expression on his wise face. &quot;I am worried about Miss 
Bannockburn. She has no magical power or any form of weapon/weapon 
training. If she enters Instrumental Rapture with us then she will be in 
constant danger.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll protect her with my life. She will be safe.&quot; Rain responded.

Mr. Oro shook his head. &quot;You cannot be sure of that. Can you assure her 
safety while locked in combat with Sunderarajan? I do not believe so. 
And he would more than likely use her helplessness as a shield. Thus she 
cannot enter Instrumental Rapture. Teela must remain here.&quot;

&quot;But will Miss Teela be safe on her own?&quot; Gatou asked. 

She would be. But Mr. Oro got the feeling that none of them would be 
willing to believe that. Well there was something he could at least do 
about that issue. The old adept pulled up one of his hands and put 
together his index and middle fingers. He shut his eyes and mumbled in 
that ancient tongue once more. All eyes turned to the shattered pieces 
of Al Kaheotl. They all were surrounded in Mr. Oro&#39;s naturally green 
magical energy. And those pieces began to reform until Al Kaheotl was 
standing proud and alive once more. Gatou, Rain and Teela were all 
astounded by such magics.

Mr. Oro gestured to Al Kaheotl. &quot;I have rebuilt Al Kaheotl under my own 
spell. If anything should happen to come by while we&#39;re in the 
Instrumental Rapture, it will protect Miss Bannockburn to its end.&quot;

Rain still didn&#39;t like the idea of leaving Teela alone but what else 
could they do? The future Queen turned to the former slave and smiled 
warmly. Rain plainly could tell that Teela was worried about what might 
happen in there. Teela had such an expressive face. But Rain intended to 
return. She had a tribe to defend after all. Teela took that warm smile 
from her friend as an assurance that things would be okay. Then Rain 
walked up to the Inferno Gate with Gatou and Mr. Oro. 

While Branwen&#39;s eyes rolled to Baja, on her shoulder. &quot;Stay here with 
Teela in case of anything, Baja. It would be safer for you, too.&quot;

&quot;Okay. Just remember to come back alive, Branwen. I still have to keep 
my promise to Sophia and watch after you, in the end.&quot; Baja then flew 
off the Dark Sorceress&#39; shoulder and flapped over to Teela. 

Branwen then walked up to the Inferno Gate with Rain, Gatou and Mr. Oro. 
And in that second, the three of them jumped into the portal. First 
Rain, then Gatou, then Mr. Oro, and then finally Branwen. While Teela 
and Baja both hoped and waited for their safe return.

**********

The Instrumental Rapture was unlike anything that Rain had ever seen 
before. Four wisps of figures materialized into the realm. They were 
Rain, Mr. Oro, Gatou and Branwen. Each landed upon the grounds of the 
place. But were amazed to see it. When Mr. Oro had described it as a 
kind of prison dimension, Rain had gotten a different image in her head. 
This place was so opposite of that picture. It was a space of reality no 
bigger than 200 metres. It was surrounded by ferocious winds that 
happened to be the colour of purple and pink. The whole of this 
miniature dimension gave off these colours. They fused into a kind of 
sickly appearance of beating flesh, while the hard ground replicated 
that image but in stillness. Every now and again, you could hear screams 
and weeping. Not from any specific person. Just sounds that hung in the 
air of a reality that few people would ever see. 

Gatou gazed around the confined area. &quot;So this is the Instrumental 
Rapture, eh?&quot; 

But soon all four of them had more to worry about. They looked over at 
the centre of the Instrumental Rapture. And there stood the half-God 
they were after. In all his glory.

Sunderarajan.

Branwen took note of that which used to be her father, Allen Mortiria. 
He was extremely tall, around nine and a half feet in height. But that 
was not his most distinguishing feature. His body was a representation 
of how his ascension was made incomplete by Sophia. The left half of his 
body was warped into demonic flesh and structure. With charcoal black 
skin, covered in hideous beige veins that pounded up and down with his 
heartbeat. His muscular left arm was far longer that than of his right, 
with long claws and a bright red jewel fixed into the palm of that hand. 
From the left side of his skull extended a huge ivory horn that curled 
outwards. His teeth on the left side of his mouth were sharp and jagged, 
while his left eye was the colour of blood; glowing hauntingly in the 
darkness of his face. The right half of his body was more humane. But 
just as frightening. The right side of him was his visible skeleton with 
his former human flesh eternally rotting off of it. There was no eyeball 
in the right socket of his skull. And in Sunderarajan&#39;s bony right hand 
was a long staff called Balmung. It had rings attached to its tip that 
jingled every time moved. The only piece of clothing that Sunderarajan 
wore was a kind of blue loincloth around his waist. 

This was the terrible half-god, half-man that attempted to reach the 
Dark Side and attain ultimate power. The being that Sophia Mortiria 
could not defeat. Sunderarajan.

&quot;Is that him?!&quot; Rain asked loudly.

Branwen sneered. &quot;...Father...&quot; 

&quot;HA, HA, HA, HA!&quot; Sunderarajan&#39;s voice echoed loudly in the Instrumental 
Rapture even though it was not his intent, &quot;SO SOMEONE HAS FINALLY DARED 
TO ENTER THE INSTRUMENTAL RAPTURE, HAVE THEY!? AND MY LOST DAUGHTER HAS 
JOINED WITH THEM! WELL WELCOME TO MY DOMAIN! OR SHOULD I SAY, MY PRISON! 
SOPHIA&#39;S POWERS WERE STRONGER THAN I HAD PLANNED FOR BACK THEN! AND NOW 
I HAVE BEEN GIVEN A SECOND CHANCE TO CONQUER THE WESTERN EMPIRE!&quot;

&quot;What do you mean by that?!&quot; Rain questioned.

Sunderarajan chortled once more. &quot;HA, HA, HA! YOU CANNOT SEE IT, CAN 
YOU? MY POWERS ARE AS DEADLY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN! AND YOU HAVE JUST 
OPENED THE DOOR TO MY FREEDOM! ONCE I KILL YOU THE PORTAL OF THE INFERNO 
GATE WE REOPEN! I CAN EXIT INTO THE WORLD AGAIN! AND WITH BOTH THE 
ORTEGA AND THE ATAMA SWORD IN MY POSSESSION, NOT EVEN THE TWELVE ARMIES 
OF THE GOD KING WILL STAND A CHANCE AT DEFEATING ME! YOUR FOLLY IN 
ENTERING INSTRUMENTAL RAPTURE HAS COST YOU YOUR WORLD! IT IS MINE!&quot;

Mr. Oro took on a fighting stance and spoke. &quot;Incorrect. The reason we 
came here was to destroy you, Sunderarajan. We have objectives that 
demand such action. Prepare yourself!&quot;

&quot;OLD MAN! YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE ME IN MY OWN DOMINION?! YOU SHALL PAY 
FOR YOUR ARROGANCE WITH YOUR LIFE! AND THE EARTH SHALL BE MY REWARD!&quot;

None of them were prepared to allow that. Gatou growled fiercely and 
drew the blade Shinae from its sheath. Then withdrew Binu in the other 
hand. Rain took a deep breath and pulled the Atama sword from out of its 
own sheath on her back. Mr. Oro watched Sunderarajan with both caution 
and a firm momentum. While Branwen unlocked her Ortega powers. Her 
amethyst glow returned to her, along with the wings. This was now the 
time to use all of their powers. 

&quot;Attack!&quot; Gatou bellowed, charging straight across the grim dimension to 
the towering Sunderarajan. He pulled back his sword Binu and lunged at 
his foe, slashing downwards in motion. But Gatou gave an equally stunned 
yell as the sword bounced off a very potent energy field. One that held 
such authority it threw him back down into the ground. 

Branwen blinked. &quot;A magical shield?&quot;

Mr. Oro would not wait to test that theory out. The old master mumbled 
in his ancient language to himself, shutting his eyes and summoning 
together his magical power for the following spell. His eyes shot back 
open and he thrust out one of his hands. A blazing sphere of flames was 
fired from him and then thrown at Sunderarajan. Again he did not move so 
much as an inch. He remained as he was and stood with more of that 
horrible laughter. The Fire Ball magical attack collided with 
Sunderarajan&#39;s magical field with a glorious roar and burst of cinders. 
But nothing of it had hit the half-god. 

Mr. Oro lowered his hand. &quot;It would seem that he has some form of 
magical protection. Far stronger than usual.&quot;

The battle-drive that Rain inherited from her father was now showing 
itself to everyone again. &quot;Then we will just have to wear it down until 
we break it! Yaah!&quot;

Rain ran straight for Sunderarajan with her sword at the ready. The 
taller being did not move. Just like before. Rain called out a feminine 
battle cry worthy of a warrior princess of Souru-Kai and slashed at 
Sunderarajan. Even the blade of Atama bounced off the shield when it 
struck. Rain staggered backwards from the force of being repelled. But 
did not give up her attack. She put some room between herself and the 
former Ungod, and summoned power into the Atama. It glowed brightly with 
a silver gleam that Sunderarajan smirked at. Rain then tilted the 
beaming sword into a diagonal position and it fired a searing beam of 
white-hot fire at the target. The beam crashed straight into the force 
field that was protecting Sunderarajan and burned into it continuously. 
But the beam could not get through. Rain gritted her teeth and 
maintained the power of her Silver Storm attack but did nothing to break 
the force shield that was protecting Sunderarajan. The blast ended when 
Rain could no longer maintain it, and all that hot silver energy faded 
away. Sunderarajan laughed once more as Rain caught her breath and Gatou 
climbed back up to his feet. 

But that was the most Branwen wanted to hear. Her crystalline energy 
wings fluttered and she flew straight for her father. Her enemy. As she 
swooped towards him she gathered up power into her right hand. An orb of 
newer magic powers grew before that hand. Branwen grunted and threw that 
power ball at Sunderarajan. The blast crashed against his 
almost-invisible shield of enchantment. It shattered without leaving 
behind any damage whatsoever. Branwen landed and scowled at this. 

Sunderarajan sneered at her. &quot;SO! MY OWN DAUGHTER ATTACKS ME, EH?! YOU 
WOULD TEMPT FATE BY BITING THE HAND THAT FED YOU, CHILD?! YOU OWE ALL 
YOU ARE TO ME!&quot;

&quot;I owe you nothing!&quot; Branwen responded angrily, &quot;I am my own and no one 
else&#39;s. To me you are nothing more than an obstacle! I&#39;ll smash through 
you if I have to!&quot;

&quot;HEH, HEH, HEH, HEH.&quot; Sunderarajan chuckled, &quot;YOU HAVE GROWN UP STRONG, 
MY DEAREST BRANWEN. JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER. I WOULD HAVE MADE A PLACE FOR 
YOU IN MY KINGDOM, YOU KNOW. HAD SOPHIA NOT INTERFERED, YOU WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE PRINCESS OF THE ENTIRE WESTERN EMPIRE. WITH ALL THAT POWER AT 
YOUR FINGERS YOU STILL OPPOSE ME? YOU SHARE TOO MUCH WITH YOUR MOTHER! I 
SHOULD HAVE KILLED HER WHEN I HAD THE CHANCE! BUT I WON&#39;T MAKE THAT 
MISTAKE WITH YOU, DEAR BRANWEN! THIS IS YOUR LAST DAY OF LIFE!&quot;

Branwen did not plan on her death any time soon. But Gatou was the first 
of them to react. He sheathed Binu and withdrew Sahara in one hand, then 
lunged for the Half-God again. Focusing more power into the slash. But 
it was the same result as before. Gatou yelled out with surprise and was 
tossed back into the ground of the Instrumental Rapture. Rain then ran 
ahead her herself and attempted the same. With the same outcome. She was 
thrown back with equal force when the Atama sword was resisted 
violently. 

&quot;That&#39;s a strong shield,&quot; Mr. Oro mused, &quot;All of you! Stop! Do not face 
him individually! We must combine our efforts to break that shield!&quot;

Rain, Gatou and Branwen all nodded to and acknowledged that. But the 
target of said plan, Sunderarajan, simply laughed it off. &quot;PETTY 
INSECTS! FUSING YOUR FORCES TOGETHER WILL DO YOU NO GOOD EITHER! MY 
POWERS TRANSCEND YOUR LIMITED UNDERSTANDING! YOU WILL ALL DIE!&quot;

None of them took heed of that. Rain scrambled back onto her feet and 
evened out the Atama sword like before. Gathering the strength necessary 
to cast the Silver Storm attack. Branwen extended her right arm and 
wrapped her left hand around the wrist. She too concentrated herself. 
And pieces of summoned amethyst energy met together before her hand to 
create an all new attack. Mr. Oro made that two-fingered sign and 
chanted to himself to prepare his own magical attack. While Gatou 
stepped back. He would follow up the assault. Rain reached her peak 
first. The silver shine of Atama now vividly apparent. She turned her 
head to the left and looked at Branwen. The blast at her hand was ready. 
Mr. Oro too was ready. Then each of them zoned in on Sunderarajan. Rain 
fired the Silver Storm, Branwen shot her energy sphere, and Mr. Oro cast 
a gushing ball of isolated wind at the enemy. The Tiger Wind technique. 
All three of the magical skills crashed with the shield positioned 
around Sunderarajan. This time the Half-God did not looked as composed 
as before. The shield struggled to hold back the three attacks of magic. 
Until it could do so no more. There was a bright flash of that that 
surrounded the taller creature, destroying the shield that was 
protecting him. 

The Balmung jingled when the shield was shattered. Leaving Sunderarajan 
without his previous defences. &quot;YOU FOOLS!&quot;

The shield was gone. Gatou beamed a victorious grin and rushed ahead to 
attack. But now that the shield was gone, it also meant that 
Sunderarajan could now attack. Gatou swung Shinae around to slash at the 
upper thigh of the taller creature. But Sunderarajan growled an echoing 
howl at him. He twirled Balmung around to meet with the slash. The two 
weapons collided and the attack was blocked. Gatou looked up with a 
grimace at Sunderarajan. He got the feeling that Branwen&#39;s Daddy was 
feeling angry. Sunderarajan pulled back Balmung and then thrust it 
straight into Gatou&#39;s stomach. The force of the blow was so strong that 
Gatou coughed up blood just a few seconds after the strike. Sunderarajan 
then swung that staff around and smacked Gatou across the face. The Kahn 
of Souru-Kai was knocked back with a flash of blood. Rain blinked and 
ran to protect him from a second blow. When the mighty Sunderarajan 
swung Balmung back down, Rain swiftly got between the it and Gatou. With 
a two-handed grip on the Atama, Rain blocked the staff from landing a 
blow on him. She shut an eye and grit her teeth when she felt how 
physically strong this being was, weapon-locking with him.

&quot;GAAAH!&quot; Sunderarajan growled under his breath, &quot;YOU DARE TO STAND 
AGAINST ME WITH THAT SWORD?! YOU DON&#39;T EVEN KNOW THE ROOT OF ITS POWER! 
I WILL MAKE ALL OF YOU SUFFER FOR YOUR ARROGANCE! YOU AND THAT 
TRAITOROUS DAUGHTER OF MINE SHALL ALL BE RETURNED TO THE ABYSS!&quot; 

Rain struggled to hold back Balmung with the Atama sword. While Gatou 
pulled himself together, Mr. Oro and Branwen began to react. The older 
one performed that two-finger sign again and repeated his mumblings of 
those old chants. The words flew freely from his wrinkled lips and the 
power began to circulate. A cloud formed above Sunderarajan as a result 
of this new spell. Mr. Oro lowered his hand swiftly and it awoke. From 
that grey cloud came dozens of thin drops of rain. But they all came 
down like icy needles to irritate and tear at the flesh. Sunderarajan 
lowered the great pressure he was placing upon the weapon lock and 
scowled at this attack. Mr. Oro&#39;s Rain Dance magic forced Sunderarajan 
away from the princess as the sharp droplets of rain came down at him 
savagely. He swung Balmung straight at the cloud and destroyed it before 
it could do him any damage. Meanwhile Branwen had already charged up an 
attack of her own. Her long locks of black hair jerked back when she 
fired another of those purple energy bolts. Sunderarajan scowled as he 
felt it crash into his back, striking him forwards. Smoke rose from the 
patch at his back where her had been hit. And he looked over his 
shoulder at his daughter with a furious expression on the demon side of 
his face. 

Sunderarajan pointed the Balmung directly at her. His demon-side lips 
moved up and about as he chanted his own magical incantation. Just like 
Mr. Oro did to use his own magic. A ball of intense flame surged in 
front of the staff. Fire that roiled and circled around itself. 
Sunderarajan tapped the Fire Ball with the tip of Balmung. The ball was 
then sent straight for his progeny. Branwen readied herself and threw 
her hands down before. She created a momentary magical shield of her own 
and the Fire Ball attack burst against it, protecting her. As the 
Half-God ambled over to Branwen to take up the fight with her, Rain 
inspected Gatou. There was a nasty gash across his face. Blood oozed 
freely from the dark wound crossing over his cheek. It wasn&#39;t a mortal 
wound. But it would make thing harder for him.

&quot;Gatou,&quot; Rain said caringly, &quot;Are you okay?&quot;

The sword-master smiled at her. &quot;Of course I am. These bones aren&#39;t make 
from chalk. But I get the feeling... that I am outclassed in this 
battle.&quot;

Rain smiled. &quot;You just take it easy. We&#39;ll handle it from here.&quot;

With that said and done, Rain stood up and re-doubled her grip around 
the Atama sword. Across from them was Branwen and the demon-man himself. 
The younger one stepped back and fired another magical wave at her 
father. Sunderarajan slapped the shot away effortlessly with Balmung. 
Then his meaty, demonic hand reached out and gripped her around the 
neck. Branwen widened her eyes with the sudden loss of air and was 
hoisted upwards by nothing more than sheer strength. 

Sunderarajan looked into her eyes. &quot;YOU IMPETUOUS CHILD. I CAN GUESS WHO 
YOU GET THAT FROM. WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES I CAN SO CLEARLY SEE 
SOPHIA. THE WOMAN WHO CURSED ME TO THIS LIVING HELL! THE WOMAN WHO 
BETRAYED ME! YOU DARE TO FOLLOW IN THE FEEBLE FOOTSTEPS OF YOUR MOTHER?! 
YOU DARE TO BETRAY ME LIKE SHE DID?! I&#39;VE NEVER BEEN MORE SURE OF IT! 
YOU DESERVE NOTHING BUT DEATH!&quot;

And while Sunderarajan was mouthing all of that, Rain was charging him 
from behind with the Atama sword at the ready. But that was foreseen. 
The large Sunderarajan swung Balmung back behind him while his other 
hand held up Branwen. Rain crossed her arms over her face and tightened 
up when the Half-God&#39;s actions triggered a wave of force to come 
careening her way. Princess Rain skidded backwards on her shoes from the 
power of that wave. Preventing her attack from seeing the light of day. 
Mr. Oro hopped off his position in the back and pulled his fingers 
together for more magic. But this time; Sunderarajan could see that as 
well. He pointed Balmung behind him without looking back. Another wave 
force was created. But this time far closer to its target. Mr. Oro 
gasped as the wave struck him threw him off his feet. He slipped and 
fell upon the ground of the Instrumental Rapture. 

Branwen choked as Sunderarajan&#39;s grip grew tighter and tighter around 
her neck. His physical power was amazing. But before she passed out, 
Branwen slowly pulled up one of her hands. She pointed it even in 
Sunderarajan&#39;s face and blasted him with one more of those purple 
magical strikes. The tall creature scowled and stepped back, releasing 
Branwen from the flash of light in his eye. The Dark Sorceress dropped 
to the ground, coughing and spluttering, while a drip of blood trickled 
down from her left nostril. 

Sunderarajan held his demon hand to his face and yelled; &quot;YOU WHORE OF 
AN OFFSPRING! YOU DARE TO STRIKE ME, AGAIN?! FOR THAT, I WILL MAKE YOUR 
DEATH EVEN MORE PAINFUL! I&#39;LL MAKE YOU BEG ME TO END YOUR MISERY!&quot;

But Rain came at him again in his reverie. Sunderarajan looked up with 
surprise as he saw Rain jump through the air to slash at him. The girl 
cried out and slashed straight across the demon-side of his face. So 
hard it caused the monster to scream.

&quot;ORRAAAAGGGGHHH!&quot;

Blue blood splattered over the smooth glass-like floor of the 
Instrumental Rapture. Rain, Branwen, Mr. Oro, and Gatou all gazed at 
Sunderarajan. And saw a long slash down the dark fleshy side of his 
face. Light blue blood flowed freely from it. Sunderarajan held a hand 
to his face and looked down at the woman who had struck him, Princess 
Rain of the Souru-Kai. 

&quot;WHY YOU...&quot; He seethed, &quot;YOU DREW MY BLOOD! NO ONE HAS EVER DRAWN BLOOD 
FROM ME! I WILL MAKE YOU SUFFER FOR THAT! YOU WILL SUFFER!&quot;

There was no second warning Sunderarajan pointed Balmung straight at the 
princess. She attempted to do something but realized that she was being 
stopped. She couldn&#39;t move. The blood red eye in the demon-side of the 
Half-God&#39;s skull glowed even brighter. And an electric charged passed 
from Balmung to Rain. The blonde shrieked in torture and writhed 
aggressively as that lightning-based magic shocked her entire body. So 
powerfully and so painfully that tortured Gatou just to watch it. Rain 
continued to jerk and scream from the pain of the electrical attack, but 
could not escape it. 

&quot;Princess!&quot; Gatou yelled. 

Mr. Oro pulled himself together and stood back up from the ground after 
that previous shot. He made the sign and performed the incantations. A 
loud roar thundered around the Instrumental Rapture. Great light 
surrounded a point before the old wizard. A wolf-like apparition rose up 
from that, made entirely of light itself. The Luminescent Fang magic 
skill charged across to meet with Sunderarajan head on. And he was so 
focused on punishing Rain that he didn&#39;t notice it. The wolf of light 
crashed into him with a noisy echo. A wave of light passed away from 
that point and the spell on Rain broke. The princess collapsed to the 
ground. Alive, but running out of gas thanks to that last trick. 
Sunderarajan shook his head to knock off the effects of the Luminescent 
Fang magic. But before he could finish the job, Branwen pushed her hands 
out and blasted her Father again with more magic energy granted from the 
Ortega. Streams of amethyst light that hammered into the hideous being 
at his chest. Sunderarajan struggled against that beam of power, 
weakened by both the Lightning Fang and Rain&#39;s slash of his face. Thus 
he could not respond quickly. 

While Branwen held him off, Mr. Oro yelled to Gatou. &quot;Quick, Kahn Gatou! 
The staff! Cut it from his hand!&quot;

The sword-master nodded and ambled up to his feet. He withdrew Shinae 
from the sheath at his waist, and then drew Yoona; the long dagger 
strapped to his back. He then began a slow and chugging run towards 
Sunderarajan. Once he was close enough, he swung Yoona in an upwards 
slash which cut a deep gash into Sunderarajan&#39;s bony left arm. Then 
Gatou sliced downwards with Shinae. The second strike was the 
money-maker. Sunderarajan howled out as his left hand was cut from its 
arm. Along with the Balmung Staff. Gatou then backed out of the way as 
Mr. Oro began his new assault. His feet shuffled around as he performed 
the hand gestures and the chants to ready his skill. Once he had charged 
the suitable amount of energy inside himself the attack began. The sage 
thrust both hands right at the demi-god. A glorious and amazingly 
powerful beam of white light was hurled in the direction of Sunderarajan 
from his hands. It was the Strataga magic skill. That energy struck 
Sunderarajan firmly in the back. Drilling into him with all the force 
that Mr. Oro could muster. The part-demon himself grunted at the 
additional magic being cast on him. But he could not reply to it. And 
while Branwen and Mr. Oro kept up the attacks, Gatou shouted to Rain,

&quot;Now, Princess! While he&#39;s distracted! Finish it!&quot;

She needed to second urging. The woman, still dazed by the electric 
attack, got back up and summoned every ounce of power she could into her 
sword. The silver glow began to encircle the Atama sword. She jumped up 
into the air above and then descended to Sunderarajan, while he was held 
off by the dual attacks from Branwen and Mr. Oro. Rain roared another 
brutal war cry and thrust the energy-charged Atama sword straight 
through the neck of the monster. Blue blood splurged from the neck and 
all the energy of the Atama sword was planted into it. Rain ripped the 
sword from his neck, jumped back from him and landed away. Mr. Oro and 
Branwen dropped their attacks and stood back as Sunderarajan&#39;s body 
started to erode. His left bones began to melt and his dark flesh on the 
right of his body rotted away. Streaks of light appeared all over his 
torso, as if he were about to shatter. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Hollered the forgotten tyrant of Instrumental Rapture, &quot;NO! NO! 
THIS CANNOT BE! THIS CANNOT BEEEEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;

In that instant, he exploded. Rain, Gatou, Branwen and Mr. Oro looked 
away as the demon-human was blown apart by a combination of all their 
efforts. Not a single shred of his was left when the light disappeared. 
All four of the victorious warriors looked astounded. 

Gatou blinked. &quot;We are victorious?&quot;

&quot;There is still one thing we need to do,&quot; Mr. Oro pulled his hand up and 
started to chant, just after saying, &quot;All of you come to me. 
Instrumental Rapture has nothing sealed within its innards now. So the 
Seraphic Maiden must be placed inside of it.&quot;

Rain, Gatou and Branwen slowly ambled over to Mr. Oro, weary from the 
fight with Sunderarajan. The wise old man continued with the spell that 
would summon the Seraphic Maiden here from wherever it was currently. It 
was out by the shores of the Western Empire. A nearby village of people 
were in a panic about what to do against it. Some fleeing, some staying 
to defend. But before the Seraphic Maiden even came to their shores, it 
was surrounded in an orb of light. Imprinted with runic symbols. That 
orb soon after vanished from their sight. It reappeared inside 
Instrumental Rapture. Rain, Gatou and Branwen watched this. Bit by bit, 
the fragments of magic energy that surrounded the Seraphic Maiden fell 
away. Leaving the six-winged angel in full view. Mr. Oro put the 
finishing touches on the spell and collapsed from the strain. Gatou 
quickly grabbed him before he fell.

&quot;Now,&quot; Mr. Oro said tiredly, &quot;The Seraphic Maiden has been sealed inside 
the Instrumental Rapture. We must escape before it attacks us.&quot;

The Seraphic Maiden began to shriek as Rain and Gatou hurried away to 
the portal barrier they had come through. Mr. Oro moved to escape 
shortly after they did, but turned back and saw an unmoving Branwen 
stare at that which used to be her love.

Mr. Oro shook his head. &quot;She is not the Mia you knew anymore, Branwen. 
We have to leave now before it reacts.&quot;

&quot;I know. It&#39;s just... hard to let go of someone you&#39;ve cared about for 
so long,&quot; And then she turned to join Mr. Oro and the others as they 
escaped the Instrumental Rapture. She simply took one last look at the 
Seraphic Maiden before she exited that place, &quot;...Goodbye, Mia.&quot;

Destiny always has its price. 

**********

And that was how the saga of the Seraphic Maiden was ended.

I can imagine that it was very hard for Branwen to seperate from Mia. 
But the truth was that Mia had ceased to be, long ago. The dreaded 
creature she had become, that unholy demon of destruction, was now 
locked away. It was better for her and for others. And on the day of our 
victory, we all returned to our new lives. 

Kahn Gatou, the masterful and imposing swordsman, helped restore Khnum 
to what it had been before the attack of the Sky Dragon Army. 
Resurrecting both its Metanim and his own trained group, the Ashkar 
Swordsman. He now teaches his Gatou-ryuu to everyone willing to learn. I 
have a feeling that the Souru-Kai Kingdom is in safe hands with him as 
the head of its armies.

Mr. Oro, the eccentric wizard whose knowledge saved the world, returned 
to his life in the large library of Anshiva Palace. He said that his 
years should be spent preserving the knowledge for future generations. I 
can imagine that he will play a big part in my decisions in future, 
however...

Branwen Kalia Mortiria, the former Black Metanim, vanished without a 
trace. She had won her freedom from the Western Empire by participating 
in the failed Operation Jumah, something that even God King Saul would 
respect. She and her faithful &#39;guardian&#39; Baja disappeared into the 
night, leaving behind all her past. Some say that she went back to the 
South to visit Mia&#39;s grave. Others claim that she returned to the North. 
I have no idea which story is true. But I am aware that she was a woman 
I greatly respected. I wish you all the best luck possible in future, 
Ungod.

Of course, the little slave turned heroine, Teela Bannockburn, is still 
hanging around Anshiva Palace with me. She is the woman closest to my 
heart, after all. We&#39;re kind of lovers now, but you have to keep it a 
secret! I&#39;m betrothed to some prince from a different tribe... so I 
doubt the Advisors would be too pleased to hear that I&#39;m sleeping with 
my best friend. But can you blame me?

As for me, Rain of the Souru-Kai Tribe, I&#39;m preparing for my coronation. 
The princess shall soon be Queen. I know that when I ascend to the 
throne, I&#39;ll have to settle down from battling Shrike with the Atama 
sword. It&#39;ll be a little boring. After all, I&#39;m the kind of girl who&#39;s 
used to risking her life on the battlefield with her soldiers. But peace 
is what my father wanted and so it&#39;s what I want also. Thankfully we 
have been able to talks with the Western Empire over the treaty. So a 
repeat performance of what happened seems less likely. Yep, it all looks 
to be wonderful from now on. I guess the adventure that I had with Teela 
and Gatou... will be my Last Saga.
