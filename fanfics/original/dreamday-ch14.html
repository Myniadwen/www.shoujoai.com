<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 14 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>A group of boys circled around a small Kris and laughed as they each 
took turns kicking a little girl. &quot;Tomboy&quot; one of them yelled out as his 
foot connected with the girl&#39;s head. &quot;Crybaby&quot; another laughed as he 
kicked her against a wooden fence. Kris crouched on her hands and knees 
while holding her ribs. She could taste blood in her mouth and one of 
her eyes wouldn&#39;t open. The boys watched as she wobbly got to her feet. 
She looked around bewildered. Her eyes were clouded over as her mind 
worked away at shutting off the pain. One of the boys approached her and 
she suddenly turned to face him. Before he knew what was going on, the 
girl struck out and punched him in the nose, she turned quickly and 
kicked out at another boy. Yet another one grabbed the girl only to get 
bitten on the arm, he tossed her to the side and she rolled across the 
ground. Once more she stood up. She licked the blood off of her hand 
before turning her attention back to the group of boys. They were all 
older than her, yet, right now, all sense of reason was gone from the 
girl&#39;s mind. All she seemed to care about was blood. 

Kris prepared to rush back into the group when a pair of small arms 
wrapped around Kris&#39;s waist and held her from jumping back into the 
fray. Jennifer struggled with Kris&#39;s flailing arms. The boys began to 
step forward when they saw Jennifer&#39;s mother running towards them. They 
each split up and run in different directions. Jennifer&#39;s mother dropped 
down beside her daughter and tried to help her calm her friend. 

Jennifer held Kris tightly in her arms whispering softly into her ear, 
&quot;Kris, it&#39;s me. You are safe now.&quot; Slowly the anger drained from Kris&#39;s 
eyes and she grew limp in Jennifer&#39;s embrace. Without a word, Jennifer&#39;s 
mother scooped the child into her arms and carried her back to their 
home. 

Kris woke up to find herself in Jennifer&#39;s bed. She felt the bandages on 
her face, then sat up to look at herself in the dresser mirror. Her lip 
was puffy and she had a black eye, there were a couple of bandages on 
cheek and forehead. All she could think of was how was she going to 
explain this to her mother. Every week since entering Junior High she 
had been in a fight of some kind. The boys liked to tease and push her 
into walls  because she refused to dress, or act, like a girl. Her 
parents didn&#39;t care and the teachers only told her she wouldn&#39;t get into 
this kind of trouble if she behaved like everyone else, after so much 
abuse Kris finally snapped. 

She didn&#39;t remember what happened. All she could remember is the fog 
rushing around her and everything turning red. It was beginning to 
really scare her. Once a boy pushed her into a wall at school and the 
next thing she knew she was on top of him and hitting his head on the 
ground. The teachers hauled her off to the office and called her mother. 
She received a beating that she would never forget on that day. Now she 
had been in another fight and she knew she wouldn&#39;t be able to hide it 
from her mother for very long. It was kind of funny; her mother told her 
that she didn&#39;t want to hear that she had been crying in school so she 
didn&#39;t tell her, and then her mother would get angry because she lied. 
Then her mother told her to stop letting people pick on her and do 
something about it, so she started to fight back and then her mother got 
mad because she hurt
someone who was trying to hurt her in the first place. Her mother even 
sent her to martial arts classes to learn to control her rage and learn 
to defend herself. She was only doing what they taught her to do, 
however that was not how everyone else saw things. 

Kris lay back in Jennifer&#39;s bed and pulled the pillow around her head. 
She could smell Jennifer&#39;s scent all over it. The smell made her forget 
the pain in her head. Kris stopped and wondered what her mother would do 
if she knew about Jennifer and her. Jennifer&#39;s mother caught the two 
girls kissing once and she gave them a long talk about how they were too 
young for that kind of thing, however she didn&#39;t tell them to stop. In 
fact, Kris thinks that Jennifer&#39;s mother knew more about the two girl&#39;s 
&quot;activities&quot; then she let on to. Kris rolled over and hugged the pillow 
close to her and rubbed her face against it when she noticed Jennifer 
standing in the door smiling. 

&quot;You are cute when you do that you know.&quot; She smiled, &quot;You almost look 
like a cat in a way.&quot; Jennifer had become even more beautiful over the 
past years, Now thirteen the girl was starting to look more like a young 
lady then a little girl. Kris was embarrassed for she was still a thin 
flat chested child, nevertheless Jennifer loved her always and to prove 
this she walked across the room and kissed Kris softly on the forehead. 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you close the door?&quot; Kris asked not really caring, but 
thought it should be mentioned, &quot;I mean what if your mother passes by?&quot;

Jennifer grinned playfully, &quot;She went out to get some food. How&#39;s your 
head?&quot; She touched the back of the girl&#39;s head.
                                                            
Kris shrugged &quot;It&#39;s alright I guess.&quot; All she could feel was a dull 
throbbing. &quot;I have a hard head remember?&quot;

Jennifer rubbed her own forehead as she was reminded of the other day 
when she tried to give Kris a surprise kiss by sneaking up on her 
friend, except that Kris turned around before she could kiss the girl 
and their heads collided, knocking Jennifer to the ground, &quot;How can I 
forget?&quot; The two girls laughed. Jennifer sat on the side of the bed, 
&quot;Mom said you should lay still for tonight. She called your mother and 
explained things.&quot;

&quot;Explained things?&quot; Kris sat up fast and felt a dizzy spell take hold of 
her, &quot;She didn&#39;t tell her what happened did she?&quot; The girl seemed close 
to a panic attack.

Jennifer lowered Kris back to the bed, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. How many 
times has my mother fixed things with yours? She&#39;s great at this kind of 
thing.&quot; She reassured the girl that everything was going to be alright.

Kris let out a sigh. She was right, Jennifer&#39;s mother had smoothed 
things out for Kris on several occasions. She just wished that she could 
live here with Jennifer and would never have to face her mother, or her 
father for that matter, ever again. She once ran away from home to stay 
with Jenn, but was sent back at the end of the day. Her parents never 
knew she was even gone.

Jennifer, noticing Kris was thinking too much, leaned over and softly 
kissed the girl on the part of her lips that weren&#39;t badly hurt. Kris 
quickly forgot about her parents and everything else as she wrapped an 
arm around Jennifer and pulled her closer.
