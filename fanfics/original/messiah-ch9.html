Chronicle Nine - the Fat of the Land 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Leviathan was a mighty battleship. It could cruise over land, sea 
and air with its great powers. However the one piece of terrain it could 
not traverse was space. The ship was too large in size to be able to 
make it to space. The fundamental problem with all battleships like the 
Leviathan. Such a scenario made it easier to acknowledge the importance 
that Protocol (both New and Holy) placed on its few leanings in space. 
Travel into space was significantly more difficult than scientists of 
previous eras could have predicted. Thus getting entire armies into 
space was not a three minute thing. It had taken nearly a day to get the 
Chrysalis Meta Suit forces (comprised heavily of Gusions and led by 
Terry/Bishamon and Celaph/Orobas) into the Sky Cord. Something that was 
confirmed when  morning started to descend on the Leviathan and the 
landscape around it. But now the easy part was over, here came the hard 
part. Pulling off this little coup. 

Three people stood at the platform of the Leviathan&#39;s bridge. One of 
them was the commander of this whole operation, Colonel Cecelia Faye 
Beatrix. Beside Beatrix was her second in command and future wife, Major 
Sophia Mariette. And next to Sophia was the co-leader of this mission, 
put in that position at the behest of Celaph himself. And that woman was 
Chizu Yagata. 

Things didn&#39;t change much on this ship. Chizu and Beatrix still didn&#39;t 
like each much. But for the sake of the mission, they would be forced to 
work together. Chizu pressed her left hand into the railing (brandishing 
her engagement ring) and called out to the helmsmen of the ship. 
&quot;Report. What&#39;s the current status on Celaph and Terry&#39;s team?&quot; 

Helmsman #1 replied slowly. &quot;All 202 Gusions, the Bishamon and the 
Orobas have ascended the Western European Sky Cord, ma&#39;am. It will take 
only ten minutes for them to launch from it now. Which means that they 
should reach space in time for the battle.&quot;

Chizu nodded in acceptance of that. Then she leaned over the railing and 
stared at the distant image of the Sky Cord on screen. It was a fabulous 
piece of machinery, really. In terms of height it was about three 
kilometres straight up. Thus its peak could not be seen from the ground 
level. Its white metal presence climbed up from the hills of the 
countryside and inched its way into the clouds. From there on it could 
give means to reach space. It most cases the Sky Cords were more like 
lifts with an additional propulsion than anything else. Ascending them 
did not take long However they were constructed for the transportation 
of goods and light shuttles, not Meta Suits. Adjusting to that change 
meant taking things slowly lest the Sky Cord was overstressed. Chizu 
knew that better than anyone. It was the reason that getting their half 
of the Anti-Holy Protocol army into the Sky Cord had taken so long.

Chizu adjusted her headset and sighed. &quot;I see. And what of Miss Mishima? 
Have you been able to restore communications with the Oriax yet?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no ma&#39;am,&quot; Said helmsman #2, &quot;the Oriax has shut off all its 
transmissions with Chrysalis, the Leviathan, and EDEN. And there&#39;s no 
way to trace Lieutenant Mishima on that suit, either.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not surprising,&quot; Chizu commented, &quot;The Oriax was built with 
radio frequency jammers to block... or at the very least, distort; radio 
frequency signals for stealth missions. And yet I can&#39;t help but wonder 
why you&#39;d let Terry Hennig walk off scot-free after knowing that he 
aided in Yumi Mishima&#39;s escape.&quot;

Sophia answered that one. &quot;Lieutenant Mishima didn&#39;t &#39;escape&#39; because 
she is not a prisoner Though she may have temporarily absconded without 
permission, we will take full steps of punishment against her. And the 
reason Lieutenant Hennig was not punished after he admitted aiding her 
escape is because we have more important things to worry about. Don&#39;t 
we?&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Chizu stated, &quot;but the Oriax is still Protocolian property.&quot;

&quot;Holy Protocol or New Protocol?&quot; Sophia asked sarcastically 

&quot;The Oriax was created in the Ochiai Underground Research Facility, 
below the Shinrai Building. The scientists controlling the site were 
loyal to Celaph above even the Upper Council at that point. Naturally, 
we regard the Oriax as a possession of New Protocol now.&quot;

Sophia scowled. &quot;Is that all you can think about? Protocol and Celaph?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m only investing myself in New Protocol&#39;s best interests,&quot; Chizu 
said, &quot;that is what I consider most of all in my work. How can you blame 
me for that?&quot;

The Major stared at Chizu for a moment. &quot;...You&#39;re nothing like the girl 
I met six months ago.&quot;

Chizu closed her eyes. &quot;Chizuru Matsubana was just a fabrication. A 
disguise I used. And those days are over now. My concern is for the 
continued success of my group and its leader. Such a thing is not a 
crime, is it?&quot;

The two subordinates, Chizu and Sophia, the two women who were in love 
with the people that commanded them (Celaph and Beatrix) glared at each 
other. Sophia knew from the beginning that Yumi had left partly because 
of her feelings for Chizu. And it angered her to think that Chizu still 
only looked at Yumi as a disposable pawn for her organization&#39;s plans. 
Even Celaph had made moves to change himself and his opinions on the 
rights of the people. Yet Chizu was still the same as always. Still icy 
and cold. And Sophia couldn&#39;t trust someone like that. Especially not 
Chizu. 

Helmswoman #3 suddenly interjected. &quot;Colonel Beatrix! It&#39;s started!&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Beatrix uncrossed her arms, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;The battle, Colonel! The Panzer Satellite has detected battle contact 
involving the first half of our military forces! The Divine Blade have 
already begun their assault upon the New Protocol Meta Suit Division!&quot;

Sophia altered the position of her glasses. &quot;Damnit. Bring the 
satellite&#39;s images up on screen, please.&quot;

The overhead video screen that framed the front half of the Leviathan&#39;s 
bridge switched from the outside view of the Western European Sky Cord 
to space. Though the cameras of the world&#39;s most powerful earth-orbital 
satellite, the Panzer, they could see the battle beginning between the 
Divine Blade and the New Protocolian half of the Anti-Holy Protocol 
Resistance Forces. In the close distance was the glowing white presence 
of the moon, surrounded in stars and darkness. On the moon was the Lunar 
Station, the thing that Holy Protocol was gunning for. Soon the 
explosions of defeated Meta Suits began. The trail of exhaust burning 
from the thrusters of all those Meta Suits illuminated space. As well as 
the exchange of laser fire. The Amons, Baals and Zagans of the Divine 
Blade went head-to-head with the Amons of the NPMSD. All seven of the 
people on the bridge watched the clash begin from their positions. This 
was it.

Chizu folded her arms. &quot;What suits are the Divine Blade using? And how 
many of them are there on the battlefield?&quot;

&quot;The Divine Blade&#39;s troops seem to consist of Zagan-types, Baal-types, 
but the vast majority of them are Amon-types,&quot; Said helmsman #2, &quot;The 
suit leading the DB is definitely the Morax suit of Selena Fol, the new 
leader of the Divine Blade. And according to these readings the DB 
definitely number at about 570 suits.&quot;

Sophia mused. &quot;That&#39;s more than we were expecting I guess Meta Suit 
production was increased in Holy Protocol after all that&#39;s happened in 
the past six months.&quot;

&quot;How many Meta Suits does the NPMSD have?&quot; Beatrix asked Chizu.

&quot;Around 250. That was the most we could manufacture since the Great 
Schism The costs of training, production, and materials set us back in 
such a way that we could not do more to bolster the force.&quot;

&quot;So the NPMSD are outnumbered by more than half,&quot; Beatrix replied, &quot;the 
battle will not last long if Lieutenant Hennig&#39;s team procrastinates. 
How long will it take for the Chrysalis forces to enter in the battle?&quot;

Helmswoman #4 answered that. &quot;About 1140 seconds, Colonel!&quot;
 
Beatrix&#39;s face hardened. &quot;...That should be enough time for the NPMSD to 
hold out on. Lets just hope that they can muster the courage and 
strength to do that. It will be disastrous if they can&#39;t.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Antarctica

The continent surrounding the South Pole, arbitrarily defined as the 
region lying south of the Antarctic Circle. Occupying 10% of the world&#39;s 
surface, it was almost 1.5 times the size of the USA. Antarctica 
contained 90% of the world&#39;s ice, representing nearly three-quarters of 
its fresh water. It had an area of 13,000,000 sq km/5,019,300 sq mi; ice 
shelves which fill the surrounding seas add a further 1,300,000 sq 
km/501,930 sq mi to this figure. Antarctica could be divided into two 
regions, separated by the Transantarctic Mountains, which extend for 
3,500 km/2,175 mi and whose peaks, many of them exceeding 3,000 m/9,850 
ft in height, protrude through the ice. The larger region, known as 
Greater or east Antarctica, is comprised of ancient rocks lying mostly 
at sea level, which are approximately 3,800 million years old. In 
contrast, Lesser or west Antarctica is 150-200 million years old and had 
mountain ranges buried under the ice. These include the Antarctic 
Peninsular and the Ellsworth Mountains, in which the highest peak in 
Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, is located; height 5,140 m/16,863 ft. The 
few peaks that are visible above the ice are known as nunataks. Two vast 
seas, the Ross Sea and the Weddell Sea, cut into the continent. Between 
them lies the mountainous Antarctic Peninsula, which was originally 
connected to South America before continental drift. Only 2% of the land 
was ice-free. With an estimated volume of 30 million cu km/7.2 million 
cu mi, the ice-cap has an average thickness of approximately 2,000 
m/6,600 ft, in places reaching depths of 4,000 m/13,000 ft or more. Each 
annual layer of snow preserves a record of global conditions, and where 
no melting at the surface of the bedrock has occurred the ice can be a 
million years old. 

It was because of all this that Antarctica was the perfect place for 
isolated Meta Suit battles. The ice and snow was easily traversed by 
mecha, and more importantly, there was little that could get in the way. 
In a snow field of the most southern part of Antarctica, Victoria Land, 
the Raum Meta Suit stood it wait. Its large metallic arms were crossed 
against each other while snow slowly descended on its armour from the 
clouds above. Freeman sat in the cockpit of the Raum with closed eyes 
and crossed arms, waiting for the one he knew he was destined to face. A 
twinkle went off in his heart. One which he knew to be his senses 
telling him that the Eros was near. Then the sensors of his Raum went 
off. The video screen in his cockpit focused on something in the 
distance. It was the Oriax, flying at him at a tremendous speed. She had 
found him.

&quot;So you&#39;ve come, Eros...&quot; Freeman remarked.

The Raum lifted its mighty right arm and opened its palm. Out from it 
came the Palm Gatling barrel. A barrage of bullets was shot in the 
Oriax&#39;s direction, the rapid-fire sound echoing throughout the snow 
fields. The Oriax darted to one side of the shots, flying around their 
path and descending. The heavy twin feet of the Machine God landed then 
to the ground, their sensors acting in place of traction. The Raum and 
the Oriax faced each other across a space of 300 metres. Which was not 
very much, considering the size and speed of the Meta Suits.  

Yumi pressed a few keys on her control pad to assume direct 
communications with Freeman, enough so that she could see his face on 
her video screen. &quot;Freeman I have come as you asked.&quot;

&quot;So you have,&quot; Freeman said with a smirk, &quot;...and I knew you would find 
me. You and I are drawn together by fate. Both as descendants of the 
Novus Deus... and as parents to that which should have been a true God. 
We are the next step. The true force and light. The alpha and the omega. 
We are not members of the flock. We are selected to be its leaders.&quot;

The Japanese girl frowned. &quot;I didn&#39;t come here for debates about the 
relevance and importance of our shared existences. I came here to settle 
this thing between us. But before we begin... I have questions that only 
you can answer.&quot;

&quot;Speak.&quot; Freeman offered. 

&quot;Rain Harland. The boy at Green Cloud. He was swallowed up by a sphere 
of his own Qi energy. That same thing happened to me. And I suspect that 
it happened to you as well. Explain that to me. What is that 
experience?&quot;

Freeman chuckled in his cockpit. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. Some might argue our 
unworthiness because such things can take place within our hearts. Even 
I don&#39;t want to believe that. But I can&#39;t renounce the possibilities, 
either.&quot;

&quot;Answer my question!&quot;

&quot;Very well, Eros,&quot; The Westerner began, &quot;By now you must have heard the 
tale of the origin of mankind. Novus Deus came down to the world and 
breathed life by spawning the Bio-System entity. That entity divided 
itself into multiple forms which would become known as humanity. The 
sustained mental connection between humanity was shattered by the thirst 
for knowledge by a single woman. The Second Sin. The sin that provoked 
the death of the Novus Deus. That is the way modern homo sapiens came 
into being. Those were the events dubbed as the &#39;Seven Keys&#39;. However 
those times were far more important and detailed than Protocol would 
have originally suggested to you. Which says much of the organization&#39;s 
true nature when taking into consideration the importance of the Novus 
Deus to its doctrines.&quot;

Yumi growled &quot;What&#39;s your point?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m getting to it. The Second Sin cast a darker shadow over the world 
than most people actually realize. When that woman, who solely attempted 
to monopolize the data of the Interlink, committed the Second Sin, it 
hailed the first ever divergence from our God&#39;s true grace Because of 
her action, the first and penultimate evil was  generated. The Second 
Sin itself was given an incarnation, becoming manifest in a solid, 
physical form That form is what the ancient humans called Astaroth.&quot;

&quot;Astaroth?&quot; Yumi blinked.

&quot;That&#39;s right. The counterpart to the Novus Deus,&quot; He said, &quot;as Asch 
Metzereph, the second Tablet of Destiny, states; &#39;Where there is a God, 
so too shall there be a Devil&#39;.  A force that would oppose the virtue of 
the Novus Deus to the bitterest end. There was a meeting between the two 
before the death of the Novus Deus. The nature of that meeting is 
unknown to us. Though we do know that the Astaroth died shortly 
afterwards. While the Novus Deus died and its corpse transformed into 
the original Eros and Thanatos, the Astaroth underwent a similar demise. 
Its being separated into two forms. That of its body, and that of its 
soul. The corpse of the Astaroth remains buried somewhere beneath the 
ice of this continent we now stand on. Far too deep for Protocol to 
reach. And its spirit? The spirit maintained its own psyche and foresaw 
its own revival  We now refer to that spirit as the &#39;Heart of the 
Astaroth&#39;. In a bid to reassert itself on the face of the world, the 
Heart of the Astaroth soon sacrificed its mentality to yield a wave of 
spores which have been dubbed as the &#39;Seed of the Astaroth&#39; Each of 
those seeds were embedded within select human beings across the globe. 
Thus the Heart of the Astaroth could preserve itself in the souls of a 
small portion of humanity. The modern-day descendants of those people, 
people whose genes were infected by the Seed of the Astaroth, are called 
&#39;Ashtars&#39;. That boy you spoke of, Rain Harland, happens to be an Ashtar&quot;

Yumi narrowed her eyes with thought. &quot;...Rain...&quot;

Then Freeman continued. &quot;Ashtars are unique in that they have the 
ability to fuse their essence with the Heart of the Astaroth. What 
happened to your friend is the beginning of that. We call it Periodic 
Phase Sealing Phenomenon or &#39;Divine Hibernation&#39;. The Qi of the Ashtar 
in question will consume them upon experiencing some sort of mental 
surge as a result of a traumatic event. Sadness seems to be the most 
preferable emotion to cause it. Once an Ashtar undergoes Divine 
Hibernation they then become tantamount with the Heart of the Astaroth, 
giving them great powers and all new control of Qi-flow. This state is 
the first level of symbiosis with the Heart of the Astaroth, referred to 
as &#39;Demi-Gnosis&#39;. This Demi-Gnosis state is something both you and I 
have attained. If an Ashtar surpasses that level and achieves a full 
symbiosis with the Heart of the Astaroth, a Complete Gnosis, they become 
an entity known as an &#39;Ishtar&#39;. Not even I know the powers that are on 
offer to a form of such strength, but... an Ishtar would far transcend 
our own strength. I suspect that the Triad of the Inquisition have 
delved their hands into the Ashtar legacy because they seek to 
manipulate the powers of an Ishtar. If there is ever anyone strong 
enough to reach that level.&quot;

Though Yumi consumed all that was said to her, she focused on Freeman&#39;s 
mention of the Triad of the Inquisition. &quot;...That name. The Triad of the 
Inquisition. I know that they are the ones pulling all the strings. Even 
Princess Ashura is just a puppet to them. Who are they?&quot;

&quot;The Triad of the Inquisition, Aherg, Ein and Karahi, are three ancient 
Ashtars who have attained Demi-Gnosis. But rather than gain an increase 
in fighting ability or Qi strength, they were blessed with increased 
intelligence, trans-dimensional presence, and physical longevity. They 
are all at least 2,400 years old. However they do not have the ability 
to sustain themselves in the natural world. With their combined Qi they 
made a slight alteration in the fabric of time and space and weaved 
themselves a small and personal dimension in which they could exist. 
That dimension can only be reached by an Ishtar, or by summoning from 
one of the Triad. Consequently only a few people like myself and Celaph, 
have ever met them face to face.&quot;

&quot;What are their plans?&quot; Yumi questioned.

&quot;Alas, not even I know that,&quot; Freeman replied, &quot;all I know is that they 
seek a holy redemption in the eyes of God, knowing themselves to be 
Ashtars, ones tainted by the seed of the original evil They somehow did 
that by removing the Seed of the Astaroth from their bodies. I am at a 
loss to explain how they could have retained the Demi-Gnosis state if 
that is true, but it would probably explain why the Triad of the 
Inquisition cannot sustain themselves in the physical world.&quot;

&quot;...I see,&quot; Yumi said softly, &quot;I just have one last question. Are we 
Ashtars? Do you and I possess the Seed of the Astaroth like Rain?&quot;

Freeman sniggered derisively. &quot;...The answer is no. The Tablets of 
Destiny do not say that our forefathers were possessed by the Seed. 
There is absolutely no one who has a universally accepted explanation as 
to why you and I have attained Demi-Gnosis. Some say it&#39;s because our 
bloodlines are still &#39;impure&#39; because of the Second Sin. And since it 
was the Second Sin that gave birth to the Astaroth in the beginning, the 
Triad of the Inquisition seem to share that view. As well as that 
bastard doctor who had the nerve to address me, Geist Fahlem. But know 
this, Eros. Our fates are tied to this point only. Our child was 
forsaken by destiny and became nothing more than a pale Vulnus Deus. 
However God&#39;s will is righteous and he has decreed our fate. One of us 
will enter into the new era. And it will be me...&quot;

Yumi&#39;s face hardened, re-gripping the control sticks of the Oriax. She 
wasn&#39;t about to die here. Not when she had heard that. She had to keep 
living. To know the full truth about everything. And the first step 
towards that was defeating Freeman.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The space region outside Sector 4 of the Moon Block was now swamped in 
the flames of destruction Already wrecked and burned pieces of defeated 
Meta Suits lay drifting in the gravity-less void of space. Their dead 
pilots were nowhere to be seen in the wreckage, lost forever after being 
blown to bits. But the battle was still on. And slowly, slowly but 
surely, the Divine Blade was wearing down the New Protocol Meta Suit 
forces. The energy trails of the exhaust of the Meta Suits still flashed 
from point to point as the two armies proceeded to destroy each other. 
Both knowing that they had a mission to fulfil. 

At the head of the Divine Blade&#39;s assault was the Morax. Inside the 
Morax was the new leader of the Divine Blade herself, Selena Fol. The 
Morax flew out into the crowds of NPMSD Amons that were heading her way. 
At least four of them. NPMSD Morax #1 and #2 raised their hand cannons 
and aimed in the Morax&#39;s direction. The chain of fire came seconds later 
from those cannons. The Morax ignited its thrusters and darted to one 
side of the laser fire. Flying to one side it jetted forwards with its 
own laser cannon in hand. The Morax pulled up its gun and fired into the 
torso of NPMSD #2. Hard laser fire was buried into the armour of the 
mecha. Soon after it exploded, hurling its scraps of oil and painted 
steel every which way. The other three Amons owing themselves to New 
Protocol rushed at the Morax from opposing sides. One of them shot out 
blasts from its own beam rifle. The Morax vaulted upwards to avoid those 
shots. Which them nailed the other Amon behind her. While &#39;above&#39; the 
two remaining suits she fired two heavy blasts in either direction of 
her from below. The blasts from her cannon hammered into the heads of 
the last two NPMSD Amons in her way. The following damaged triggered off 
explosions in the memory circuit of the suits. Effectively, this 
immobilized them. 

While the Morax retracted its gun arm, Selena sighed within the cockpit. 
&quot;Hmph. What a bunch of no-account amateurs. And I left Earth for this?&quot;

The leader of the Divine Blade tapped a few keys on her control panel, 
which brought up a screen of what was taking place on the far west 
quadrant of the battlefield. Her soldiers were having the hardest time 
there. So she would probably have to go other there to help them out, 
considering that this side of the battlefield was under control. Just as 
Selena was prepared to fly to the west sector of the fight, her sensors 
picked up something else coming towards the battle from directly behind 
her. The Morax shifted around to see what was coming. And when her 
cameras caught onto the sight, Selena gasped. 

&quot;Goddamn it!&quot; She expressed, &quot;Chrysalis!&quot;

The Fol girl would have known those Gusions from anywhere It was them. 
In all their glory It was an army of a few hundred Uvalls headed off by 
two custom-model Meta Suits, the Bishamon and the leaner Orobas. They 
came into the battle between the NPMSD and the Divine Blade with 
exceeding speed and made their mark as soon as they did In moments of 
entering the battle, fresh explosions from the DB side of the conflict 
began to rend the quiet of space. The Bishamon M-2 charged in head first 
for the fight. It pulled up its right arm and the steel of its gauntlet 
parted. Out came the Bishamon&#39;s Wrist Cannon. A blast of pure, 
concentrated Qi energy was fired from it in a beam pattern. That beam 
then burned through the steel torsos of at least eight opposing mecha. 
The Bishamon came flying through the thick cloud of smoke that resulted 
from the following explosion. Which put it on the other side of the 
field. It extended its hand and its Gatlings came from its palm. A 
shower of bullets was blown across everything in the Bishamon&#39;s 
crosshairs. Hundreds of bullets were buried into the armour of the five 
Amon flying in its way. They were all gunned down by that rapid fire 
attack, causing them to be engulfed in their own combustion. The 
Bishamon then retracted its Wrist Cannon and its palm Gatling. Terry 
pressed a few keys and scanned the field for what was going on so far. 
The battle had suddenly taken a turn for the better now that Chrysalis&#39; 
Uvalls had entered into the fray 

&quot;Heh,&quot; Terry smiled, &quot;Looks like we got here just in time.&quot;

Suddenly gunfire came down in his direction. The Bishamon burst its 
thrusters on and jetted to one side of that incoming fire. Its head 
cranked back to get a good look at the one shooting at it. It was the 
Morax. The Meta Suit of the Divine Blade&#39;s leader floated downwards 
until it was hovering at a similar height as the Bishamon.

Then Selena called out to the Bishamon&#39;s pilot. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. I didn&#39;t 
want to believe it. When I saw your mecha at Green Cloud, I didn&#39;t even 
recognize you. But after what Leena told me... there is no doubt that 
you are the one...&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?!&quot; Terry yelled, &quot;You&#39;re Selena Fol, right? 
That chick who&#39;s taken Naam&#39;s place as leader of the Divine Blade?&quot;

Selena smirked at her video screen. &quot;Don&#39;t play dumb. I know it to be 
true. Now throw off your guise! Show me your true self! I don&#39;t want to 
fight you at a Qi rating of 7,400! I want to fight you at your full 
power! Evolve into your true form! Show me the power you presented when 
you destroyed the Third Defensive Line of Ix Nos Babel!&quot;

Terry&#39;s eyebrows arched. This girl had to be insane. He was not the one 
who beat the Third Defensive Line, six months ago. That was done by the 
Asmodeus, piloted by the living corpse of his mother. &quot;What the hell are 
you on about? I destroyed the first two lines but the other one was...&quot;

&quot;Silence!&quot; Selena barked, &quot;I know who you are! Terry Hennig! Nephew and 
murderer of General Naam! No matter what your true power is, I won&#39;t let 
you get away with it! I won&#39;t let you get away with it!&quot;

&quot;What the?&quot; 

The Morax came screaming forwards with its gun at the ready. Blasts were 
fired. The Bishamon flew upwards and a diagonal angle to avoid those 
shots. It then reached behind its back and gripped the hilt of its Giant 
Energy Katana. The Bishamon quickly withdrew the sword and converted Qi 
energy from its generator to the sword. Terry&#39;s Meta Suit then slashed 
downwards to produce a huge, sweeping arc of Qi force. That arc hacked 
right through the metallic hands of the Morax. The beam rifle was 
thereafter dropped.

Selena scowled. &quot;Damn you!&quot;

The Bishamon then flew forwards and did a half-loop through the air of 
space, then came back around while twirling. The sword, charged up with 
bright green Qi, was thrust up with the Bishamon&#39;s charge. Which was 
buried straight into the shoulder of the Morax. Selena grit her teeth 
and shut her eyes, expecting her suit to blow. But it didn&#39;t. The sword 
had struck a non-vital area. But her Morax&#39;s right arm could not move an 
inch (not that she would have been able to do anything with it now that 
the hands of both arms had been cut off). 

Terry spoke out to Selena. &quot;...I&#39;m guessing that General Naam was 
important to you. I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m surprised. That guy was tough. If 
not for the improvements that the engineers made to my Bishamon, I 
probably would have lost to him again But Naam was also the destroyer my 
village. The murderer of my father, his own brother. And he had those 
bastards in Ix Nos Babel implant the living remains of my mother inside 
the Asmodeus Meta Suit; the suit that wasted the Third Defensive Line. 
He screwed around with the Hennig Family for years. And I had to settle 
my debts for that. If that hurts you then I&#39;m sorry. I never wanted this 
life for myself. But I have a job to do now. Your people are threatening 
life itself. And there&#39;s a world down there that needs defending If it 
means taking you out then...&quot;

The Bishamon withdrew its blade from the &#39;wound&#39; it had carved into the 
Morax&#39;s right shoulder. Oil leaked from it. A double-grip was then 
applied to the Bishamon&#39;s sword. And it was buried straight into the 
chest of the Morax. A fatal blow. The red suit then flew back on the 
charge of its thrusters to escape the following explosion It killed 
Selena Fol instantly.

Terry lowered his head with a sigh. &quot;...I have no choice.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

As they always did, the Triad of the Inquisition stood surrounding the 
circular pool that acted as their window to the world. Inside of their 
spectral dimension, woven into being by the force of their own Qi. Such 
was the people of people who could attain the state of Demi-Gnosis. It 
might not have been the perfection of Complete Gnosis, but it was enough 
to cement themselves as superior. Aherg, Ein, and Karahi watched the 
circular window to the activities of the world. On it they could see the 
space battle between the Divine Blade and the combined forces of the 
NPMSD and Chrysalis 

&quot;Hmm. It seems that Celaph&#39;s helpers have arrived,&quot; Aherg stated, &quot;I 
would have never believed that he would so debase himself as to join 
ranks with our enemies. We should have foreseen this.&quot;

Ein nodded &quot;It is a disappointment. But our plans continue regardless 
The Kingdom of God will be rebuilt anew and we shall ascend. Celaph and 
his dreamers will not stop fate. Not even if has deduced our plans.&quot;

&quot;Forget not the reason, correct?&quot; Karahi suggested, &quot;this is only an 
offering to the Novus Deus and to fate. Now that all the pieces are in 
place for the final reckoning of the Sermo Period&quot;

&quot;Yes. You speak truly,&quot; Aherg looked behind himself, &quot;Now reveal 
yourself, Destroyer of the World, the Second Star.&quot;

The shadows behind Aherg suddenly parted by his command. And this 
exposed their knight apparent, Deathcatcher, the one who was formerly 
Rain Harland. Stood behind him was the darkened reflection of a Meta 
Suit. One of the three Gods of Wrath, the Diablos. The Meta Suit to 
which Deathcatcher&#39;s Qi was currently resonating A smog-like aura of 
purest sapphire blue rose up from his body. 

&quot;Your time is now.&quot; Aherg commented. 

Deathcatcher lowered himself to one knee. &quot;...It shall be done.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The semi-organic wings of the Oriax flapped back when the suits 
thrusters kicked in and pushed the Oriax backwards across the 
snowdrifts. A trail of bullets followed the mecha along as it did so. 
Each bullet buried itself in the snow, leaving behind a trail of 
indentations. And those bullets were raining down from the Gatling Palm 
of the Raum. The black opposition to the Oriax followed its white 
counterpart through the air with its arm extended and jerking with the 
force of rapid fire. The Oriax flapped backwards then separated its 
arms. The power of the Qi generator enfolded Yumi&#39;s mecha in the shape 
of a circle. The Qi Barrier took over and shielded the Oriax from the 
bullets of the Raum. Those bullets bounced off the force field until the 
Raum withdrew its Gatlings. The black suit stopped moving and then dove 
straight downwards at the Oriax in a head first dive. The Oriax flapped 
its wings and flew away from the Raum&#39;s diving point. Freeman&#39;s mecha 
smashed into the build up of snow that was beneath their feet. That snow 
was forced across the near landscape, unsettling the many snow heaps 
that had gathered up around them. The shockwaves unhinged them all in 
the current area, and those shockwaves did not end until the Raum burst 
back up from the snow at a thirty metres distance from which it had 
entered. When the Oriax was faced with the Raum again, a burning glow 
emanated around its right fist. That glow of Qi energy cast itself into 
the shape of a blade. The Gauntlet Blade. The Oriax then rushed at the 
Raum with the emerald-tone blade of energy at the ready. The two suits 
reached within striking range of each other. And the Oriax slashed at 
the lower torso of the Raum. The Raum itself darted away to escape the 
possible damage of the blade. Oriax&#39;s slash was flowed by more when it 
started swiping its arm back and forth, in and out, to strike down the 
suit. The Raum continued to dance and dart its way out of those attacks. 
Then shot out its fist from nowhere. The punch smashed the Oriax&#39;s 
&#39;face&#39; directly, cracking the steel outline of the mouthpiece. The force 
of that punch knocked the Oriax back, its feet skidding across the snow 
of the Antarctica continent. The Oriax lowered itself to two knees and 
dug its steel hands into the snow to slow down its skid. Which was when 
the Raum came flying in with its thrusters going at full blast. The Raum 
led forwards with its shoulder protruding. Then banged into the body of 
the Oriax. There was a loud crash. One so loud that it could be heard 
within half a mile&#39;s distance. The Raum pushed the Oriax forwards along 
with it in a charge. The two Meta Suits both smashed violently into a 
rocky hillock, covered in snow. The brunt of the blow was received by 
the Oriax  which was left in a gigantic crater in the frame of the 
stone. The Raum flew upwards with that, then pushed its arm outwards. 
The compartment in the palm, the one with the right Gatling barrel in 
it, opened thereafter. And another stream of bullets, along with the 
echoing sound of their rapid firing, cut through the chill air. The 
Oriax was still for a moment, pinned down on the rock. Then it acted. 
The Wave Generator inside its body now began humming with action. And 
from the mouth of the mecha came that result. A sonic discharge, 
something akin to a scream, radiated from the Oriax. Its extremely high 
frequency decibels instantly shattered the stone the Oriax was trapped 
on into shards of rock. And then those sonic vibrations made contact 
with the bullets fired from the Raum. The moment that those bullets 
entered the radius of the Oriax&#39;s Sonic Upsurge Wave (or SU-Wave), they 
were disintegrated The Raum reacted to that action. And produced an 
SU-Wave of its own, a violently soft sound that matched the Oriax&#39;s 
tranquilly rigid one. The hymns of destruction collided with each other 
in an invisible collision. Though it would have seemed that the two Meta 
Suits were simply singing at each other, it was more along the lines of 
a battle of sound. Both forces trying desperately to outdo the other. 
The undetectable sound waves continued to strain against each other. 
Causing damage to the land around them. The ice that made up the frozen 
fjords leading out to sea started to shatter. Cracking in places that 
scattered in motion across the ice. The rocky build up within the 
vicinity of the SU-Waves starting breaking up along with the ice. The 
ground beneath soon started shaking because of the stand off between the 
two forces of sound. The increasing aggressive tremors caused by the 
confrontation of the SU-Waves shook the snow above it. The ground itself 
started to part directly below the point of exchange. Until it began to 
collapse into itself. The miniature  earthquake tore apart the ground 
within a 168-metre distance of the conflict. The snow, ice and rock 
within that area found itself crushed under the combined might of two 
sonic discharges that struggled to overpower each other. Then the war of 
sound ended. Both the Oriax and the Raum were forced to end their 
SU-Waves at the same time, exhausting that ability for the time being. 

The Raum then jerked its metal right arm to its side and its hand 
started glowing. A blue Gauntlet Blade shot out from the hand, with a 
straighter broadsword shape as opposed to the scimitar-shape of the 
Oriax&#39;s. The Raum then dove down in the Oriax&#39;s direction. White suit 
itself reproduced its own Gauntlet Blade. The Oriax flapped its wings 
and bolted forwards into the air The two suits met in the air and locked 
blades with each other. Bolts of friction escaped the point of 
connection; the green blade of the Oriax now locked with the blue blade 
of the Raum. The faces of both Meta Suits were facing each other. 
Presenting a clear view to their pilots.

Yumi scowled inside the cockpit. &quot;I refuse to lose this fight, Freeman!&quot;

&quot;Eros...&quot; Freeman said to her, &quot;...only one of us can make it into the 
new era. Only one of us will see the end of the Sermo Period, and carry 
this planet into the divinity of God&#39;s bosom. That person... shall be 
me!&quot;

The Raum then kicked from the leg. Its foot knocked the stomach area of 
the Oriax. Yumi&#39;s suit was pushed out of the Gauntlet Blade battle and 
thrown downwards in the air. Oriax shot up its left hand in reply and 
opened the palm. Its Gatlings poured out a heavy surge of bullets. The 
Raum lowered its Gauntlet Blade and reformed its Qi Barrier. The bullets 
shooting from the Oriax&#39;s Gatlings bounced off the shield without so 
much as a dent. Once the Oriax retracted its Gatlings at the fruitless 
nature of the attack, the Raum went on an attack of its own. It down 
straight down at the Oriax in the morning sky. It energized its Gauntlet 
Blade again. Then, mid flight, it slashed. The keyed up Qi manipulation 
cut straight through the left arm of the Oriax, slicing it off in a 
single stroke. Oil and electricity leaked from the circular joint of the 
arm And inside the cockpit of the Oriax, Yumi released a bloodcurdling 
scream. All the pain Oriax felt, she felt. The metal arm fell downward 
until it landed on some loose rock under the snow, destroyed by the 
SU-Wave crash. The Raum then acted again and slashed at the Oriax again. 
Yumi was too caught up in the agony to notice But she knew the results 
implicitly when a searing pain crossed the upper half of her leg. Yumi 
shrieked with agony once more when the Raum cut the right leg off the 
Oriax. It was a blow that was so frank and so strong that the Oriax 
could not sustain its hovering. The white suit fell out of the 
Antarctica skies and crashed into the snowy ground, the light in the 
Oriax&#39;s glass-plastic eyes flickering. All the while the Raum remained 
hovering in the air. 

Freeman smirked. &quot;Just as I thought. No one is more worthy than I am 
This is the end of the road, Eros. A silent hymn to the one who owns my 
heart. The mother of my child. I bid you farewell.&quot;

In the water-sphere cockpit of the Oriax, Yumi whimpered and groaned at 
the pain she had received from the damage done to her Meta Suit. Though 
there was no actual bleeding or damage done to her own body, the nerves 
of her flesh had the same pain threshold as the Oriax when she piloted 
it. Ever since that day, six month ago. The day she underwent Divine 
Hibernation. The day she gave birth to another worthless Vulnus Deus. It 
had all come down to this. There was no way that she could continue to 
fight in this condition. 

&quot;Am I finished...?&quot; She asked herself. 

Things around the area fell quiet. Eerily so. Beads of sweat dripped 
down the outlines of Yumi&#39;s face when she lay in the seat of the 
cockpit, waiting for Freeman to deliver his finishing blow. It was then 
that Yumi heard a blip. It was an indication of a recorded message being 
opened by the central processing unit of the Oriax. It startled her for 
a moment. Yumi knew that it was not Freeman who had sent it, and there 
was no one around for miles who even knew of where she was. So the 
message had to have been programmed into the Oriax itself. The message 
needed no ushering from Yumi for it to be opened, and suddenly it 
started. The face of a man came on screen. A man who looked to be in his 
late twenties, wearing glasses and bearing Asiatic looks. He was a 
stranger to Yumi, but strangely enough... he looked familiar to her. As 
if she had seen him before. 

&quot;I have no way of knowing who it is that will be listening to this,&quot; 
Began the recording, the man&#39;s lips moving in unison with the words, 
&quot;but my suspicions are that it will be you, Yumi. When I worked with 
your father, his bitterness towards the Ochiai Underground Research 
Facility provoked me into investing myself in the development of the 
Oriax. I knew he would have wanted some form of assurance in terms of 
your safety. I have not forgotten that in the many years since Doctor 
Katsuragi&#39;s death. So I am doing this for you. By now I have undergone 
many changes, so you will not recognize me. But for now, you can refer 
to me as Doctor Geist Fahlem. The fact that you are seeing this message 
means two things. One, that you have attained symbiosis with the Heart 
of the Astaroth, and two, that you are in a situation that has caused 
the Oriax serious damage. Thus, to protect you, I have installed means 
inside this data cube to warp the Spectral Circuit and provoke the 
Oriax&#39;s full metamorphosis into its true form. The bio-mechanical device 
you are piloting contains the same restraints on itself that Dr. 
Katsuragi once placed on your own powers. This is not my own doing, but 
rather that of the commanding scientists in the development of the 
Oriax. The beauty of this machine is that it contains a nano-molecular 
&#39;derider&#39; which renders it unconnected to either Meshezabel or the 
Ragnarok System. Taking this into consideration, your suit has no 
immediately foreseeable destiny. You are free, Yumi. And the fact that 
you are seeing this shows that you are in danger. Therefore I have no 
choice. Because I believe that you are a fundamental part of this 
planet&#39;s final destiny. You will have to see and confront the 
revelations yourself... but in this way, I can aid you. If you still 
have the strength, tap the code Q5F6XS97HI into the control panel. This 
will activate the derider and that will override the restraints placed 
on the Oriax. However, know this. When you press that code, you will not 
be in full control of your actions. And if you have attained 
Demi-Gnosis... there is an extremely good chance that you will resume 
Divine Hibernation. Thus if you are receiving this message AFTER your 
&#39;union&#39; with the Thanatos... the world will be a very different place 
when you awaken. The choice is yours.&quot;

Yumi closed one of her eyes and breathed in heavily. This seemed like a 
fateful choice she was making. But if this thing that Geist Fahlem had 
spoken of could help her, then she could not afford to ignore it. Yumi 
tapped the code into the control panel as she had been told. And then 
leaned back on the seat to wait for the results. At first nothing 
happened. All she could hear was the sound of her own arduous breathing 
But then there was a reaction. A huge one. One that would have untold 
ramifications The video screen ahead of her was suddenly filled with the 
text &#39;De Mundo&#39; over and over and over again. Then from the underside of 
the panel, five cables slithered out. Yumi blinked. The cables were 
actually moving as though they were alive. Like snakes, those thin 
cables shot out at Yumi The girl yelped and felt five small but stinging 
pricks on her flesh. One cable latched onto her left arm. Another cable 
latched onto her right arm. The third reached out and attached itself to 
the right side of Yumi&#39;s neck. The other one touched the right side. The 
final cable touched Yumi&#39;s left temple. Very thin needles embedded 
themselves inside Yumi&#39;s skin from those cables. Giving them direct 
access to Yumi&#39;s bloodstream. And the one at Yumi&#39;s temple had connected 
to her brain. A certain substance was pumped from the control panel 
through the cables and into Yumi&#39;s blood. Suddenly she released a horse 
shriek of pain, reverberating louder than her previous ones. A set of 
sallow blue veins started popping up all over her skin. And the glint of 
blue in Yumi&#39;s turned a dark red. The flaming silver force of her Qi 
once again appeared, enveloping her whole body. And she could not move. 
Only scream in total agony, while her actions had their effects on the 
Oriax.

Freeman looked stunned as he stared at his video screen. The Oriax was 
moving again. It somehow, with only one arm and one leg, managed to 
shift itself up into a standing position. Then something miraculous 
happened. Something that not even Freeman could have predicted. Qi 
energy extended from the damaged shoulder of the Oriax. One that shone 
brightly and then wove itself into the shape of an arm. Once the glow 
faded away, a new metallic arm, polished and shining, was left in its 
place. As if it had never been damaged. Then the same thing happened 
with the leg of the Oriax. A new one was created in place of the absent 
old one. More of that glowing Qi surrounded the torso of the Meta Suit, 
while Freeman looked on dumbfounded.

&quot;Regeneration?!&quot; He stated angrily, &quot;that&#39;s impossible!&quot;

Suddenly a transmission came into him from an outside source. Freeman 
scowled and pressed a button on his control panel to see who it was. 
Then the visage of Dr. Geist Fahlem appeared on screen. &quot;Greetings, 
Freeman Ronove.&quot;

&quot;You?! What do you want?!&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no point in getting angry now,&quot; Fahlem assured, &quot;your fate has 
already been decided You see Mister Ronove, I have been monitoring your 
actions via the satellite uplink provided to the Temple of Tlazolteotl. 
I know all that is happening. And the phenomenon taking place before 
your eyes is the only thing you were needed for. You see, this event was 
not destined to happen. According to the Tablet of Destiny known as Asch 
Metzereph, the force that the Oriax is becoming was not ordained to be 
born yet By all accounts this battle should have taken place anyway. The 
child that you and Yumi produced should have been a Novus Deus. However, 
by Protocol interfering as it did in the process, fate has been 
re-written. Thus we must adhere to the Second Cycle of Asch Metzereph. 
This era we are now in is called Sermo. It should have been the third 
and final period before the age of Synesis, the eternal time when God 
and the Earth shall be reunited. The interference of man has provoked 
the awakening of a new era. That era is Anthropos. And if the prophecy 
of Asch Metzereph speaks true, then Yumi Mishima is one of the three 
most important people to that new era. She is the First Star, De Mundo. 
Thusly she must be preserved until she can take the place that destiny 
has provided her with. The only way to do that was to incite a second 
Divine Hibernation. And as you know, Divine Hibernation only occurs with 
extreme mental surges. At this point, the only thing that could have 
triggered a mental surge strong enough to warrant the Periodic Phase 
Sealing Phenomenon is the unsealing of the Oriax&#39;s true form. That was 
your purpose all along.&quot;

Freeman&#39;s blood ran cold. &quot;...What? True... form...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Fahlem said, nudging his glasses up his nose, &quot;the Oriax is a 
masterpiece of bio-mechanical engineering  Not only was it made with 
cells owed to the 40th Vulnus Deus, but its operating system and Qi 
Generator are completely linked to the thought processes of the user&#39;s 
brain. That combined system is called the &#39;Soul Gear Engine&#39;&#39; The Soul 
Gear Engine itself functions systematically with the Oriax&#39;s inner self. 
A creature bound inside the Oriax by the physical restrains of the 
armour and the psychological restraints of the Soul Gear Engine. That 
entity I have dubbed Seraphiel. It is the foetus of a creature that our 
research teams found inside the Ancient Ruins 45 years ago. And it has 
the ability to manipulate the power of the Heart of the Astaroth. The 
existence of Seraphiel is inside that Meta Suit, both restrained and 
controlled by the Soul Gear Engine. It was a concept that was inspired 
by the work of the scientists at Ix Nos Babel, those who created the 
Asmodeus under this thesis. But that experiment failed because they had 
no system of control. My team at the Ochiai Underground Research 
Facility built the Oriax around the Seraphiel sample with the Soul Gear 
Engine as a control system But that proved just as austere. Because the 
combined force resulted in almost demonic form. The true form of the 
Oriax. That state is called &#39;Demiurge&#39;, the ultimate form of the Oriax. 
But because of its power, the scientists placed a restraint on the 
Demiurge. Preventing Seraphiel from exerting any sort of will upon the 
suit, and as a consequence, limiting its overall power by untold 
amounts. However... I knew one day that Yumi would need the full power 
of the Oriax in its Demiurge form. And that day has come. Though the 
Second Cycle states that &#39;the First Star shall not attain the true power 
of her weapon until the Anthropos era&#39;, destiny had to be bent in order 
to ensure Yumi&#39;s survival to that period. Only a Meta Suit such as the 
Oriax could allow that. Now behold, Freeman. Behold the true form of the 
Oriax.&quot;

Freeman looked out through his video screen once Fahlem&#39;s image went 
off. And he found himself staring at an Oriax that was no longer the 
Oriax. The silver glow of Qi was now gone. What was left was a darker 
version of the previous suit. The colour of the armour had changed from 
white and blue to silver and amethyst The two wings extending from its 
shoulders were now accompanied by six more, making a total of eight. 
Each of those wings were at least 200 metres long, dropping large 
feathers from its expanse. This was the Demiurge. The mouthpiece of the 
mecha&#39;s head broke open to reveal a mouth. Framed with jagged teeth and 
green-coloured saliva. A loud and ferocious scream came from that mouth. 
One so loud and so vibrant that it shook the mountain ranges off in the 
distance. Demiurge then flapped its wings and forced itself into the air 
at the Raum. 

Freeman looked on in terror at the Demiurge came for him.  The Qi 
reading on his  control panel was reading in at over 70,000 units. 
&quot;...No... this can&#39;t be...&quot;

Instinctively he tried to defend himself. The arm of the Raum pushed 
forwards and the palm opened, firing a hail of bullets in the ascending 
Demiurge&#39;s direction The Demiurge didn&#39;t even have to block them with a 
Qi-Barrier They simply rebounded off its armour. Not making a single 
mark or dent. The Raum retracted its Gatlings and then extended its 
Gauntlet Blade. Once the Demiurge came within reach, the Raum swung its 
arm downwards to slash at it. Demiurge swung back and raised its godly 
arm. The molecules of that arm started to dissolve. Then reassembled 
themselves into a hybrid version of the arm, one which extended like a 
whip. Demiurge&#39;s whip arm was hurled forwards with a lash that wrapped 
itself around the descending arm of the Raum. Stopping its attack dead.

Freeman gasped. &quot;No! This... thing can alter its own molecular 
structure!?&quot;

With little effort, Demiurge tugged at the arm of the Raum. Then ripped 
it clean off. Freeman screamed in the same way as Yumi had done before, 
feeling the pain of that action Demiurge swung its whip-arm away and 
tossed the dismembered arm of the Raum to the snowy ground below. Its 
arm reverted back to its normal state and then Demiurge blasted ahead, 
ramming into the Raum. Its hands gripped around the Raum&#39;s neck, forcing 
it back down to ground. Snow splashed upwards and stone was broken when 
the two Meta Suits returned to the floor. Demiurge pinned the Raum to 
the ground, its legs straddling the black suit. Then it opened its 
mouth. The SU-Wave was once again produced. And Demiurge released a huge 
current of sonic energy. But unlike previous ones this SU-Wave homed in 
on one point. The head of the Raum. Inside the cockpit, Freeman covered 
his ears and screeched with pain. His eardrums would pop at that rate. 
Then the head of the Raum exploded from the sonic tension. Freeman 
screamed again, while blood dripped down from his ear canals Both drums 
had been burst open. Demiurge released what was left of its neck and 
grabbed a hold of the Raum&#39;s other arm. Its grip was unbreakable And as 
it crushed the steel of the Raum&#39;s arm, Freeman wailed as his own arm 
felt that pain. The Demiurge gave one hard jerk of its shoulders and 
ripped the Raum&#39;s remaining right arm off the other shoulder The cockpit 
with filled with more of Freeman&#39;s shrieks, his confidence shattered at 
this outcome. 

&quot;It... can&#39;t ... be...&quot; He strained to say, &quot;...Eros... please...&quot;

From his cockpit, he could see Demiurge lifting its arm and clenching it 
into a fist. That punch was aimed at the stomach. Where the cockpit was 
located (inside its own mini-dimension. Before Freeman could see more of 
what was about to happen, the image of Geist Fahlem reappeared on his 
video screen.

&quot;...Y-You...&quot; Freeman seethed in agony, &quot;...you&#39;ve... done this...&quot;

&quot;It is the will of fate,&quot; Fahlem decreed, &quot;as I told you before. You are 
worthless. Your only task after the conception of the Vulnus Deus was to 
put Yumi and the Oriax in a life or death situation. One that would give 
her the necessary circumstances to unlock the true form of her suit. In 
that aim, oblivious as you were to it, you have been successful As a 
gift in respect of that, I shall tell you one last thing before you 
die.&quot;

&quot;...W-What...?&quot;

Fahlem smiled. &quot;...Have fun in hell.&quot;

Three seconds later the fist of Demiurge smashed straight through the 
stomach armour of the Oriax. It broke right through the torso and 
entered into the cockpit dimension, shattering its potency. Once the 
Demiurge ripped its arm out of the Raum, traces of blood and bone were 
covering its hand. Those were the remains of Freeman Ronove Knowing that 
victory had been attained, Demiurge tilted its head back and screamed a 
thunderous, bestial war cry. Its shriek ripped open the skies 
themselves, as the clouds parted around its area. New light shone down 
from above in the parted clouds, beaming down on a screaming Demiurge 
and the mangled remains of the Raum Then suddenly the silvery Qi of Yumi 
expanded around Demiurge. The creature continued to scream and yell 
while it was consumed by a sphere of Qi. This was the second Divine 
Hibernation that Yumi was subjected to. The second one caused by contact 
with Freeman. Soon all that was left was a gigantic sphere of silver Qi, 
and a cold, quiet snowfield. 

The fate of Yumi Mishima had not been decided... 

...but rather carried on to a new age.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Far to the northwest of Antarctica, in Middle America, lay the Temple of 
Tlazolteotl. By now the Anti-Jupiter Wave defences had been levied 
around the temple itself to protect it from what was to come. In a 
corner of that temple was Doctor Geist Fahlem&#39;s private office since his 
stay there. The scientist stepped back from the computer he was manning 
and stood upright. The satellite link to the Temple could be manipulated 
from his computer. Giving him the means by which he could monitor the 
battle between Freeman and Yumi. 

&quot;All has gone as planned,&quot; Fahlem commented, &quot;Freeman is destroyed and 
Yumi has undergone a second experience with the Periodic Phase Sealing 
Phenomenon. Though I would have preferred not to unleash Demiurge so 
soon... necessity often makes for some very difficult choices. Now all 
that remains is for the Second Star to fulfil the last act of the Sermo 
age.&quot;

A knock then came at the door. Fahlem said &#39;come in&#39; to the person 
there. And the one who walked through the door was Leena Fol The teenage 
Holy Protocolian walked in the room and closed the door behind her For a 
moment she just stared at all the paintings, diagrams, schematics and 
blueprints that were littering the walls and floor of the doctor&#39;s cosy 
little room. 

She then spoke. &quot;Hello, Doctor. Did you send for me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I did,&quot; Fahlem said, walking up to a nearby coffee table, &quot;you see 
there is something that I must ask you, Miss Fol.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

Geist adjusted his glasses, then straightened out some papers. &quot;Would 
happen to be in a relationship with Princess Ashura?&quot;

Leena gasped, blushing visibly. Someone had figured it out? &quot;W-well, 
I...&quot;

&quot;You needn&#39;t worry,&quot; Fahlem said with a chuckle, &quot;I have no problem with 
such a thing. Another one of my &#39;children&#39; is a homosexual And I have 
not told anyone else about your relationship.&quot;

&quot;T-thank you for that.&quot; Leena answered. 

Fahlem pressed his palm onto his ornamental katana. &quot;There is no need 
for that. But let me tell you a certain story I think you will enjoy. 
The woman you call Ashura was not always known as Ashura. She was once a 
young girl named Leah Cloud. An Ashtar with incredible strength, in both 
will and Qi. Thus she was incorporated into the experiments of the 
Protocol organization. But I knew from the beginning that she was 
destined for great things. Perhaps that was why I was the most adamant 
in applying life-extending drugs to her, much in the same way that I had 
done to myself. Of course, though she is significant, that significance 
cannot shine through until she achieves her Gnosis. And she will not 
attain that level until she undergoes a Divine Hibernation.&quot;

Leena blinked. &quot;Why are you telling all me this?&quot;

&quot;Do you know what the biggest problem is with Divine Hibernation?&quot; When 
Leena shook her head for a no, Fahlem continued, &quot;...it is a phase that 
can only be brought on by trauma and sadness That is the most 
heartbreaking aspect of it. Only through our own suffering can the power 
of the Heart of the Astaroth be attained. And when I ask myself why 
Princess Ashura has not yet attained Gnosis... I pondered on the reasons 
for it. Thus coming to one. Happiness.&quot;

&quot;What are you saying?&quot;

Suddenly a rush of adrenalin surged through Fahlem. Leena blinked when 
she saw him rush forwards in a stride. The seemingly frail young doctor 
launched himself at her and withdrew his sword. And seconds later, Leena 
was coughing up blood. Fahlem&#39;s katana had skewered her right through 
the cleft between her breasts 

Leena looked up, stunned and bloody. &quot;...W-why...?&quot;

&quot;Happiness is the bane of Astaroth,&quot; Fahlem said, &quot;though it is a 
detestable force, Astaroth is needed for the new era. It is needed to 
build a Kingdom worthy of the Novus Deus. And it is needed for Princess 
Ashura to reach her true destiny. The happiness you are providing Ashura 
with is preventing her from achieving Gnosis. Therefore... you must 
die.&quot;

Fahlem yanked his sword right out of Leena&#39;s carcass. And she toppled 
over, dropping to the ground. The doctor sighed, swept the sword to one 
side, and wiped the blood off of it with a cloth. He then sheathed the 
blade, and stared down at the motionless corpse of Leena Fol. &quot;...I&#39;m 
sorry. But as you said, child. One moment of slaughter for an eternity 
of happiness. Now that the Sermo age is coming to its end...  we have no 
choice but to go on... and that boy, the one formally known as Rain 
Harland, now begins the last act.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

In the black heart of the space surrounding the moon, a sole Meta Suit 
flew. The force powering its flight through the darkness was far 
stronger than any normal Meta Suit could have imagined. That suit was 
the Diablos. Its dark amethyst armour shone off the glint of the moon&#39;s 
light. The wing-like structures extending from its back possessed 
thrusters of their own. Thus giving the Diablos a greater level of speed 
than any average Meta Suit could have possibly dreamed off. Inside the 
cockpit of the Diablos was the Second Star himself, Deathcatcher And in 
his eyes was an unmistakable glint of intent. He knew were he was going 
and he knew what he was going to do. Not too far ahead of the Diablos 
was his destination A place that was going to be the hub of mankind&#39;s 
evolution 

That place was known as Meshezabel. 

It orbited one side of the moon, a few miles in distance from the Lunar 
Station. And to look at it would be to see the creative and engineering 
powers of Protocol at its fullest There was no sight in the universe 
that could have been more ostentatious. The structure known as 
Meshezabel was huge. It was utterly gargantuan. Being at least 3.4 miles 
wide by another 3.7 miles long. Its structure was circular, almost like 
a hexagon, dividing itself a towering wall-like frame that ran in a 
skeletal structure across the expanse of the layout. In most cases it 
was the size of a small city But it was big enough to hold at least 0.5 
billion people. Weighing in at an estimated weight of 
7,612,550,440,670,450 tonnes; Meshezabel was at the least the perfect 
home and foundation for a race. However it was completely empty. All the 
internal buildings and external way stations of Meshezabel were totally 
empty. The scanners of the Diablos proved as much. It was almost as if 
Meshezabel was forgotten by time. 

But that would continue no longer.

The Diablos flew over the wide vastness of the empty space city. Even at 
the full power of his thrusters, it took over ten minutes for the 
Diablos to fly into the centre of Meshezabel&#39;s presence. Putting it in 
Block D of the layout. There was a very large opening in the surface of 
Block D. The Diablos flew into that hole and descended into its 
cavernous innards. A long trail downwards was waiting for it. Once the 
Diablos reached the bottom of that elevator crevasse, the Diablos zoomed 
down the middle of one of three paths. Into that long corridor it flew, 
all the way to the end. The hall ended when a new room was exposed. The 
smell of metal was ripe in it. In the central part of that enormous room 
was a machine that would decided the fate of the world. It was the 
machine that Meshezabel would become most feared for. 

The Elymus Drive. 

Deathcatcher&#39;s Meta Suit landed to the titanium ground and it strode up 
to the tall machine. He pressed some keys on the control panel of his 
cockpit, a code which made the doors into the Elymus Drive open. Somehow 
electricity was still running on Meshezabel, even though no one had set 
foot on it for years. The Diablos marched into the Elymus Drive itself, 
its metallic feet clanging against the floor with each step taken. Once 
the Diablos was inside the Elymus Drive, the lights and controls of the 
machine started to come to life. And instantly, the Diablos started to 
link itself with the inner workings of the Elymus Drive. Thus giving it 
full access to all of Sky Continent Meshezabel&#39;s power. The chestplate 
of the Diablos broke off. Showing its heart stone, the item which 
controlled Qi projection in all Qi Generator Meta Suits. The stone 
started to glow with a very vibrant blue. The power from Meshezabel, 
magnified by the workings of the Elymus Drive, was fuelling an all knew 
ability in the Diablos. One that could only be unlocked once the Elymus 
Drive was activated. And now that day had come. 1/8 of a mile up, on the 
surface of Meshezabel, the automatic doors opened up for the execution 
to take place. But the space was then covered over by a thick pane of 
transparent plastic, one that acted as a kind of magnifying glass.

Once the Diablos had been fully charged for the attack, Deathcatcher 
chuckled idly behind his mouthpiece and said, &quot;You poor lost sheep of 
fate&#39;s advent. Hark the end of the Sermo Era. And let the sword of God 
baptise you all.&quot;

And with that, Deathcatcher commanded the Diablos&#39; to fire by pressing a 
single button. There was a thunderous and deafening impact when the 
Diablos fired its Jupiter Maelstrom attack from its chestplate. The beam 
travelled straight up the wide shaft overhanging the Elymus Drive. The 
beam then zoomed through to the top where it hit the magnifying plate. 
Because of that plate the beam almost tripled in power. It shot up from 
the surface of Meshezabel and rose until it hit something else. An 
invisible pane of Qi-resistant glass that framed the upper half of 
Meshezabel&#39;s layout. The Jupiter Maelstrom bounced off it and was thusly 
redirected at the Earth. Upon that refraction, the Jupiter Maelstrom 
split off into billions of smaller blasts, each one thinner, but each 
containing the destructive force of a full one, still magnified by the 
machinations of the Elymus Drive. The attack became the Jupiter 
Maelstrom Omega, the ultimate power of the Diablos And each one of its 
blasts encroached on the Earth.

A fair distance from Meshezabel was the battle between the Divine Blade 
and the combined forces of New Protocol and Chrysalis. The Orobas, 
Celaph&#39;s suit, raised its right arm and fired a shell from its rocket 
launcher. That shell crashed into an enemy suit and blew it up, taking 
down another target. But his mindset changed when he looked to his left, 
and saw those billions of beams inching down towards the Earth. From his 
position they looked small. And at first Celaph didn&#39;t realize the 
significance of it all. Until it hit him

A haunted look passed through his eyes. &quot;No... it can&#39;t be! It can&#39;t 
be!&quot;

The Bishamon, which was not too far from the Orobas, picked up on that 
from its transmitters and Terry addressed Celaph accordingly. &quot;Heh, 
soldier boy! What&#39;s up with...&quot;

Terry silenced himself when he saw those beams heading for Earth. 
&quot;...What is that?&quot;

&quot;No... no...&quot; Celaph repeated, &quot;how could I have been so stupid!? How 
could I have been so blind!? The target of Holy Protocol was NEVER the 
AM-Cannon! They were after Meshezabel!&quot;

The half-German, half-American pilot was confused. &quot;Meshezabel? What are 
you talking about? Do you know something about those lights coming from 
that side of the moon or what?&quot;

&quot;...Meshezabel...&quot; Celaph began with horror, &quot;...is a space city that 
Protocol created over a ninety year period. It was designed to be the 
future of space life. But when it reached 92% completion, we abandoned 
the project. Space life was considered too difficult to pursue... and so 
many had died from suffocation with just the slightest of mistakes. So 
we forsook the project... but inside Meshezabel is a powerful system 
called the Elymus Drive. It amplifies force projections from cannons and 
Meta Suits and scrambles their power into divided beams which attack 
multiple points over a specific area... that is the horror of 
Meshezabel... someone has activated the Elymus Drive and used it. When 
those blasts touch ground... it won&#39;t be a matter of how many people are 
killed... but a matter of how many people survive...&quot;

Terry&#39;s heart raced. &quot;But everyone&#39;s still down there! We have to do 
something!&quot;

&quot;There is absolutely nothing you can do,&quot; Celaph said dejectedly, &quot;it 
has already begun. Therefore it is already over.&quot;

And so it was. 

Each of the blasts of the Jupiter Maelstrom Omega scattered over the 
face of the planet Cutting through the stratosphere and the clouds, 
right before making contact with the living world. No one could have 
understood what was happening. People in the Meta Cities and villages 
over the world saw the lights of blue descending at them A beauty that 
transcended any other sight. But those beams were the lights of absolute 
destruction. God&#39;s judgement had been brought down on the world. And 
there was no one who could stop it. Once the first beams of the Jupiter 
Maelstrom Omega touched ground, that fact was made perfectly clear. 
Explosions the size of mountain ranges overtook the world. Meta Cities 
across the globe were bombarded by them. Everything within range at 
least a mile&#39;s range of those blasts were literally vaporized into 
nothingness. Meta London, Meta New York, Meta Tokyo, Meta Beijing, Meta 
Paris, Meta Berlin, Meta Sydney, Meta Calcutta, Meta Moscow, Meta 
Dublin, Meta Baghdad, Meta Madrid, Meta Johannesburg, Meta Washington, 
Meta Warsaw; ALL cities in ALL countries in ALL continents were attacked 
and thereafter destroyed. Lives, homes, and memories were burned into 
nothing in the space of seconds. Everything without a sufficient defence 
was obliterated Including the Leviathan. By the time reports came in 
about the damage being done the world over, one blast consumed the 
entire ship. Sophia, Beatrix, Chizu and everyone else on it were killed 
instantly. And the Leviathan was transformed into nothing more than 
traces of warped metal. Even EDEN, the home of the rebel forces, was 
incinerated. Killing Father Bartholomeus as well as the 900,000+ people 
living there. Devastation and death overwhelmed the world. No one was 
safe. And in the five minutes it took for the Jupiter Maelstrom Omega to 
cast its last beam, no one could have done a thing to escape it. 

Of the 2.5 billion people still living on the Earth, only 23.7 million 
of them would survive the carnage. Shortly after the deliverance of that 
attack, rain started to fall on many of the worst effected areas. 
Liberals of future generations would one day argue that to be the tears 
of God.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

In the distant region of the Triad&#39;s dimension, they observed all that 
had happened to the world from the activation and use of the Elymus 
Drive. From the circular window, placed in the stone ground of their 
hall, they could see what had occurred and all the after effects. Though 
it could not be seen, there were smiles of glee on all their faces. But 
they were not the only ones who were in that dimension this time. They 
were joined by someone else on this occasion. Someone who was neither 
Freeman nor Deathcatcher. That someone was the man know as Doctor Geist 
Fahlem. Fahlem stepped out of the shadows and presented himself before 
the Triad of the Inquisition. All three, Aherg, Ein and Karahi, turned 
to him with auras of satisfaction. 

But Ein was the first to address him. &quot;Excellent work, Doctor. You have 
proven yourself to be a worthy emissary to Bahaman. Your role as 
successor to the Keeper of the Source should be assured now.&quot;

Though he was congratulated, there was not a smile on Fahlem&#39;s face 
&quot;...I simply did as I was ordered, sir.&quot;

&quot;Nevertheless. It was good work you did, Shugo Yamamoto.&quot; Aherg stated. 

Fahlem&#39;s eyes rolled downwards. &quot;I no longer use that name. That name is 
that of a human. And I abandoned my humanity a long time ago. What has 
happened now should be proof of that.&quot; 

&quot;Do you grieve?&quot; Karahi asked, &quot;Should you not know better? This is the 
fate of the world. Death was brought down up the world as proclaimed by 
the Tablets of Destiny. Now that the rules have changed... we have no 
choice but to carry on ahead, is that not so?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Aherg bobbed his head. &quot;Good. The Sermo era is over. Deathcatcher has 
done his job well and so have you. But this is not the end. This is only 
the beginning. Now that the fat of the land has been swept from the 
board, we can concentrate on the construction of our kingdom. You will 
travel to Meshezabel at once and activate the nanotechnological 
factories on it. Once you do that we can begin the next stage in our 
plans.&quot;

Fahlem nodded. &quot;Yes, sir. Though I do have one comment.&quot;

&quot;Which is?&quot; Ein probed.

&quot;Demiurge was freed a good 6000 years ahead of time. All though it is 
restrained by Yumi&#39;s Divine Hibernation, and shall eventually be 
re-controlled by the Soul Gear Engine, it does mean that... Seraphiel 
has a much greater chance of gaining a humanoid incarnation. The 
consequences of that could be catastrophic...  even in comparison to 
what has just taken place.&quot;

&quot;Do not worry,&quot; Karahi affirmed, &quot;even if it were to gain its own 
incarnation, with combined forces of the Elymus Drive, the Ragnarok 
System and Ix Nos Babel, we cannot be defeated.&quot;

&quot;I understand, then,&quot; Fahlem said, &quot;I&#39;ll focus on Meshezabel and the 
finishing of the other two Gods of Wrath; Vassago and Mammon. A separate 
committee will have to be instigated for Lord Bahaman&#39;s total 
resurrection in the mean time... and Princess Ashura must be brought to 
Meshezabel. But all things concerned, our plans have not run into any 
problems. Things should go along smoothly from here on in.&quot;

Aherg bobbed his head with a acknowledging grunt. &quot;Good. We shall 
construct a new world in the true image of the Novus Deus. The age of 
Anthropos has finally begun.&quot;
