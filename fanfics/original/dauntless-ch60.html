<p>“Beautiful Place in My Heart: Amy and the  Argonauts?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>After dropping off Allegra, Kate, and everyone that  made a special request, Teleah and Kayleigh Acheron were exhausted.  They had circled the globe more times in the past day than they had  during most months of their career, visiting Italy, Ireland, China,  America, and now returning to Italy for Riene. They were so tired  that not even sex would rouse them; they slept like rocks as the rest  of the crew stretched their legs. Latoli came to them by taxi,  looking a little more confident and brighter for her experience. She  kept most of the details of her family reunion a secret, but was at  least willing to say she was glad she went. It had been very <em>informative</em>.</p>
<p>“So where is everyone else?” she asked, noticing  their dwindled numbers. “Don’t tell me they actually left the  ship.”</p>
<p>“If you mean, ‘leave it permanently’, I don’t  know,” Amy replied, her eyes hazy as she wiped her forehead. Her  foot-pain had returned with a vengeance, despite Fuuka’s best  treatment, and she could not walk without assistance. “But they  certainly left,” she continued weakly— “presumably to explore  on their own. It’s happened before, so I don’t think there’s  anything to worry about. Oh, Rebecca says hello.”</p>
<p>“Becky said that? To you?” Amy shook her head.</p>
<p>“She asked me to give <em>you</em> the message.”  Riene’s lips parted in a polite little gasp, and her cheeks became  warm and rosy. She smiled to herself and took a satisfied breath.</p>
<p>“I see, thank you. Um, this may not be the best  question to ask right now, but do we have another destination, or are  we resting?”</p>
<p>“I’m not really sure. The Acherons are wiped out,  and the only other native we have with us is…uh, busy.”</p>
<p>“You mean Eve? Is something wrong with the ship?”</p>
<p>“No,” Amy smiled, her pale complexion darkening a  little, “she’s just <em>busy</em>.” Riene held her hands up in  understanding.</p>
<p>“All right, none of my business. So nobody knows  where else we could go?”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” she murmured, wincing and hissing. Riene  approached her with concern, but Amy waved her off; she was fine.  “Rachel’s been thinking about seeing the Middle Eastern region.  It’s as close to her birthplace as we can find. Mink wants to see  the Grand Canyon, and Kyrie wants to visit Hawaii. Is there anywhere  you’d like to go?” Before Riene could answer, Naja called Amy  over the PA, announcing they had a visitor.</p>
<p>“Why is she…” Riene pointed. Amy made a face as  she shifted in her chair.</p>
<p>“Because it makes her happy. Rachel? Rachel, where  are you?” The perky Efreeta materialized from the ceiling, floating  upside-down and yawning. She squeaked, “Here,” before rubbing her  eyes and righting herself. “Rachel, come with me and see who our  visitor is, will you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master. Would you like for me to carry you?”</p>
<p>“No thank you,” she answered, pulling back the  armrest and revealing a control panel. Riene hadn’t noticed the  wheelchair and stood back as Amy moved out. She still looked to be in  considerable pain as she rolled out of her room towards the  gangplank. Several other women were already gathered there, wondering  who could be after them. Most of them were armed. Eve was at the  guns. An unnecessary precaution.</p>
<p>“Is this any way to greet fellow outlaws?” Most of  the women put down their arms and relaxed as the visitor revealed  herself and her crew— yes, most, but certainly not all. Trusting  “Dead” Rose Gillian certainly didn’t come easy.</p>
<p>“Can’t be too careful,” Kyrie grunted as she put  her flamethrower away. Rose chuckled warmly.</p>
<p>“Believe me, I know how you feel. So are the Acherons  still with you— and that sweet, sexy Miracle of yours? Ah, there  she is now, more stunning than ever. What happened, did you break  your leg?”</p>
<p>“I just got into a bad fight,” Amy muttered. She  and Rose shook hands, but then Rose knelt down and kissed Amy’s  knuckles. Miracle smiled timidly and Rose suddenly grimaced as her  new first mate pinched her ear.</p>
<p>“Darling, behave yourself. How is everybody doing?  Oh, where’s Sharyn?”</p>
<p>“Off in Ireland getting one of her mystic thingies,”  Rachel answered. “Lyara’s with her if you’re worried she might  start trouble.” Ferrara crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“I’m not startin’ no trouble! If any trouble  comes, it won’t be from me, got it?!”</p>
<p>“See, darling?” Alto said as she draped gentle arms  over her Captain. “Our angel knows how to behave herself. Anyway,  about why we’re here.”</p>
<p>“Right: this ain’t no social call. I’ve got a  business proposal.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” Amy smiled, “from one group of  outlaws to another, let’s find someplace comfortable so we can hear  it.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“<em>Nice</em> ship,” Rose drawled, her face lighting  up as she explored the <em>Dauntless</em>. “Really nice! Heh…enough  room to hold twice your usual number. You know, you really can’t  appreciate a ship of this quality just by looking at it from the  outside. Where’d you buy it?”</p>
<p>“It was a gift,” Amy replied.</p>
<p>“A gift, huh? Pretty sweet. Wow, you even got saunas.  We gotta start running into each other more.”</p>
<p>“Darling, the business,” Alto whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, I’m on it. Boy, what could I do  without her, huh? All right, this room seems to be big enough.  Wassup?” She smiled at Mink, who had been asked to prepare the  conference room, and put a holographic chip on a desk in the center,  tapping it twice to open up a screen. “I came across this little  trinket after I saved this really hot Scorpion-woman. Unfortunately,  uh…this was sort of my only payback. Tsk, woman was straight as  hell. Anyway, this happy little doohickey was on one of the people I  saved her from, so I, uh, liberated it. Yeah. Of course, the irony is  that even after all the trouble I went through, I couldn’t even  read the damn language it was written in, but I could recognize the  pictures well enough.” She tapped it three more times: an  unfamiliar language lit up, and behind it, the unmistakable visage of  Gaea, mother Earth.</p>
<p>“We were hoping we could get an interpreter, or maybe  some kind of cryptologist, who could tell us what these words mean.  So first we came to Gaea, right— and then, luckily for us, Cirrus  spotted you beautiful people floating around, and since I hear you’ve  got a mixed-bag crew— ”</p>
<p>“It’s Greek,” Riene said as she gazed at the  message. Rose grinned and slapped her back.</p>
<p>“See, I knew we’d luck out! So what’s it say?”  Riene peered at the letters very carefully, poking her finger through  the translucent screen as her cogs began to turn.</p>
<p>“Uh, ‘behold the messenger god who sends a chariot  from Olympus, bearing the king’s children to Colchis. Here it was  unmade and put to rest upon a tree protected by the watchful dragon.  If you seek the god’s favored chariot, you must traverse the flying  menace, past crashing rocks into wild lands where gods are imprisoned  on stone. Prove yourself to Aetes, and in the dragon’s defeat, make  your claim’. That’s the best I can make of it. Anyone know what  that means?” She looked around and saw clueless faces, but Amy was  sitting up sharply, in spite of her pain.</p>
<p>“It can’t be,” she whispered. “I thought it was  just a myth. But after everything we’ve been through, I probably  shouldn’t jump to conclusions.”</p>
<p>“What? Do you know what it is?” Rose asked. Amy  nodded her head solemnly and removed her glasses.</p>
<p>“This is a map to the fabled Golden Fleece.” Riene,  the Acherons, and Eve drew back at once, feeling their skin prick and  crawl with unfamiliar excitement. They knew precisely what she was  talking about and stood alongside her in awe. The others didn’t  have quite such a dramatic reaction, but they were nevertheless  affected: it was like being told a very powerful secret that only a  few people know. Even the simplest among them couldn’t deny that  fleece made out of pure gold sounded amazing.</p>
<p>“Hold on a second,” Eve sputtered. “Are you  referring to <em>the</em> Golden Fleece, the one Jason and the  Argonauts went after?”</p>
<p>“Do you know of any other?” Amy said. She asked  Riene to recite the hologram’s message again and made sure to  record it all. “Look here: the messenger god of Greek mythology was  Hermes; the chariot from Olympus was a golden ram that bore the  children of King Phrixus away from Greece to Colchis, which is in  modern-day southeastern Europe…or the Middle-East; I’m not sure.  The King’s daughter was lost, but his son sacrificed the ram and  hung its fleece on a tree, where it was protected by a serpent— I  guess it could be interpreted as a dragon. Jason and the Argonauts  went through those exact same trials to get it: it’s exactly the  same as the story! I’d know; I wrote a thesis on it and the  correlation between superheroes of comic books.”</p>
<p>“Seriously?” Amy nodded. “But it’s a myth,  right? I mean, it’s just like King Arthur and the Ring of  Nibelung.”</p>
<p>“Up until humans left the Earth,” Kay said, “we  used to believe that gorgons, sphinxes, centaurs, and mer-folk were  myth as well. Galactic archives have proven us wrong before.”</p>
<p>“But you can’t <em>seriously</em> believe— ”</p>
<p>“That’s why we’re going on this journey,  beautiful,” Rose said. “We’re going to find out whether this  thing’s the genuine article or if I got stiffed. Half of  treasure-hunting is seeing if the treasure’s real, right?” Eve  let out a defeated sigh and shrugged.</p>
<p>“I guess so… But why do you need us? I mean,  besides to interpret it?”</p>
<p>“That was all,” she smirked.</p>
<p>“That’s <em>it</em>? But you said you had a business  proposal.”</p>
<p>“I certainly did,” she grinned wolfishly. The  pirates drew their swords and guns, surrounding the crew.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you doing!?” Kyrie roared. Rose  blew her a kiss.</p>
<p>“We’re pirates. Now we’re pirating.” Caution  turned to defeat as the women put down their weapons and surrendered.  “The proposal was that you stay out of my business. I’ll take  your ship, too: I’ve been thinking of starting my own fleet.  Nothing personal, ladies; I’d just like to get filthy stinking  rich. You know, in case I need to finance a campaign.”</p>
<p>“You’ll use that money to buy whores and  brothel-girls,” Ferrara muttered.</p>
<p>“Hey, nothing wrong with that. My fleet needs a crew,  don’t it?”</p>
<p>“Sorry about this,” Cirrus mumbled as she wandered  around tying everybody up. “We won’t harm you. It’s just  that…when Rose sees something she wants…”</p>
<p>“No explanation needed,” Shana sighed. The general  consensus among the crew was disgust and anger, but Amy and Rachel  looked at ease. Rose caressed Miracle’s face seductively but Amy  merely stared at her, neither appearing betrayed nor annoyed. Finally  the rogue smiled, stroking her russet pigtails.</p>
<p>“Hell, I can’t leave a sexy girl like you stranded  here. It’s not in my nature. Tell you what: whoever wants to can  join my crew. I can’t allow you back on <em>this</em> ship, of  course, but it’s better than scrambling around this dung-heap. What  do you say?”</p>
<p>“Why not let us go?” Amy smirked. “Hear me out,  Rose. There’s no need for you to be so diabolical. You’re our  friends, all of you— we should treat each other as such.”</p>
<p>“All of my friends are with me on my ship,” she  grinned fiercely. “I like you all, but most of ya I wouldn’t  trust with my garbage. Besides, what part of <em>pirate</em> didn’t  you understand?”</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean. Why not make a sport of  this? That’s what you <em>really</em> want, isn’t it? It would be  too easy for you to just sail over there with both our ships and grab  the Fleece without any obstacles. It wouldn’t be fun.” Rose’s  ferocious expression softened, and she raised her eyebrow.</p>
<p>“I’m listening.”</p>
<p>“Let us go and we’ll compete with you. The <em>Dauntless </em>can’t sail on water, so you’ll get a head start  while we scramble to find a ship. Those that don’t want to come  will have to stay behind. Since we’re friends, we can make this a <em>friendly</em> contest— no wars or anything like that.” The  pirate rubbed her chin and laughed softly; she had always liked Amy’s  bold personality.</p>
<p>“It does sound pretty entertaining. But I’ve got  issues. First, how do I know you won’t use your ship— the <em>Dauntless</em>, I mean— to gain an unfair lead? Second, what  happens if one of us gets the Fleece before the other? And third: I  don’t trust that genie of yours. That’s too great an advantage.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Let’s see…first, I’ll take the  master key with me. Nobody will be able to get in and nobody will be  able to start it. Second, you can ask any member of my crew about how  I use Rachel’s powers. She is more like my friend than my servant,  and I would never ask her to do anything unless there was no  alternative. In short, you’ll just have to trust me. As for the  reward…” She smirked, but her face twisted as the pain  intensified. Fuuka demanded that she be released but Rose denied her  request.</p>
<p>“Miracle’s tougher than that. Go on.”</p>
<p>“Uh, yes,” she breathed. “If we win, you have to  apologize for tying us up. If you win, you can spend one night with  me.”</p>
<p>“Is that so!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Amy, you can’t do that!” Kay shouted.</p>
<p>“Send us instead,” Tee insisted. “We’re the  ones she wants anyway.”</p>
<p>“I’d prefer to have all of you, of course,” Rose  muttered as she signaled to her crew. They started untying everybody,  though some were more wary than others. “But if it came down to it,  I’d definitely choose Miracle. Mmm…something about brunettes with  glasses and pigtails really excites me. Okay, little lady, you’ve  got a deal. Don’t disappoint me, okay?” She winked and walked  away— but as the last of her crew went through the door, she  couldn’t resist barring it and running away laughing. “Don’t  dawdle, Miracle! A night with me can be longer than you think!”</p>
<p>“That awful rat!” Shana exclaimed as she shook her  binds off. Athena, Naja, Mink, and Kyrie had gotten loose on their  own, and Rachel had simply turned into mist, ready to attack at her  master’s word.</p>
<p>“What could you expect?” Herut said. “A pirate  will always be a pirate. Are you really going through with this,  doctor?”</p>
<p>“Well, I said I would, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“But why?” Athena snorted. “Don’t tell me  you’re serious about this.”</p>
<p>“It was the only way I could think of keeping the  ship,” she whined helplessly. “Look, Rose isn’t a bad person,  okay? I really want us to stay friends and this was the best way I  could think of to maintain that. Besides, it might be fun, and it’ll  give us something to do.”</p>
<p>“And suppose she wins. Are you prepared to sleep with  her?”</p>
<p>“She won’t do that,” Amy smiled as she adjusted  her glasses. “I trust her.”</p>
<p>“You do realize you’re talking about a pirate. A <em>lesbian</em> pirate. And she’s not exactly monogamous.”</p>
<p>“I trust her,” she repeated, glowing warmly.  “Still, there’s no harm in putting some action behind my faith.  It’s time we find a ship. Rachel?”</p>
<p>“Yes, master!” Miracle tossed her a bag of Gold.</p>
<p>“Go into town and find a rental, then bring it back  here. Those of you that want to, you may stay behind. The rest of  you, take whatever supplies you can and move out.” Amy hobbled out  as firmly as she could, making a rather striking impression on her  crew. They knew she was capable of crossing the line between ditz and  director; it just happened so infrequently that it came as a  surprise.</p>
<p>“Does she really know what she’s doing?” Naja  wondered. Suddenly, Amy lost her balance and fell over on her bottom.  The Elshyrin groaned. “Looks like she’ll need all the help she  can get. All right! All hands on deck! We’ve got some catching-up  to do.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Rose winced as the sea-salt and sea-wind splashed  against her face, into her eyes and down her cheek, permeating her  clothes and touching her many battle-wounds with a fiery kiss. Yet  there was naught but pleasure as she stood at the bow, clasping onto  the rail that separated her from watery destruction, merely a few  seconds away from Poseidon’s clutches— pleasure that can only  come from braving the mightiest and most frightening waves, when all  other senses tell you to stay back. A Mediterranean breeze tossed her  flaxen hair, filling her lungs with Grecian, Roman, Turkish, and  Egyptian perfumes, the center of humanity’s greatness on Gaea for  thousands of years— and now she was headed to what could possibly  be the living embodiment of this greatness, not merely a golden  fleece but a chance to connect with mythology, to touch the very muse  that set the poets aflame, to see, even to glimpse, the very cradle  of imagination and Story, the chance to be a part of it all. No  wealth in the universe could compare.</p>
<p>“A flying menace,” Ferrara said out of the blue,  standing half-naked at starboard, her breasts taut and her abdomen  roasting. Seldom did the feathered folk wear garments, for theirs was  a society not normally accustomed to modesty (or frost). This was the  Breathless one in her element; she took to the skies nude and only  dressed herself out of necessity, or when it fancied her. Rose gazed  at her as she drew out her thought. “D’ya think they meant me?”</p>
<p>“Even you’re not that egotistical, dear,” the  Captain gestured. “If what Miracle said is correct, all this  happened about three thousand years ago. It’s probably referring to  some natural creature that the ancients thought was a monster. You  know how these things go.”</p>
<p>“I heard that the ancient Gaeans once had giant  lizards roaming their world,” Alto said as she joined her lover.  Three identical sisters were with her, triplets named for the  seasons: doctors, and the people who had saved the Captain from death  and imprisonment.</p>
<p>“Giant lizards?” Rose blurted. “Someone must’ve  been drinking battery acid! Intelligent lizards I could understand,  but giant ones?”</p>
<p>“And not all of them carnivorous. Could that be the  dragon Miracle spoke about?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve seen dragons in my travels. There are  such thing as <em>flying</em> lizards, but giants? Really, now. Next  they’ll be seeing fish that fly or squid that live on land.”</p>
<p>“I just wish we knew more about Gaea,” Alto  fretted. She sidled next to her lover and gave her a loving little  bump. “You should’ve cooperated with them, love. From what you’ve  told me, they have several natives to this world with them. We’d be  a lot better off— ”</p>
<p>“That’s why I wanted to take a few of em’ with  us!” she exclaimed defensively. “I wasn’t gonna leave em’ <em>all</em> there, just a few. Sorry— I kinda got caught up in Amy’s little  challenge.”</p>
<p>“That’s certainly you, all right,” she smiled  sadly. Alto kissed her cheek and borrowed the telescope. “So, seen  any flying menaces yet? Or are you just staring at Ferrara’s bare  chest?”</p>
<p>“If we are going to encounter any, I haven’t seen  any yet, unless you count gulls.”</p>
<p>“I’m more worried about the crashing rocks,” one  of the sisters said.</p>
<p>“And gods imprisoned on stones?”</p>
<p>“If there’s going to be a dragon, let’s let those  other people fight them.”</p>
<p>“One at a time, ladies,” Rose waved. “Ferr-Ferr,  see if you can’t scout ahead of us for trouble. Cirrus? Now where’s  that daughter of yours…? Summer, go see if you can’t find her,  and tell her to prepare all our anti-aircraft cannons. Autumn, you  hop to it. Arms for every woman, a sword and a gun each. Winter, get  back to sick bay and get it ready. Friend or foe, real or not, we’ll  be ready for these menaces.”</p>
<p>“What about me?” Alto asked as she massaged Rose’s  shoulders. The pirate turned around, glanced down, and touched her  face.</p>
<p>“We’ll try the diplomatic approach first. If we can  talk our way through without a fight, so much the better. That’s  where that delicious silver tongue of yours comes in.”</p>
<p>“I figured as much,” she laughed. They were about  to kiss when suddenly, Alto’s daughter came barging up to the deck,  a frantic look in her eyes.</p>
<p>“We’ve got something on radar! It’s not big, but  there seems to be a group.”</p>
<p>“What’d I tell ya, huh?” Rose grinned. “Okay,  battle stations, everyone! Don’t fire until I give you the word!  Thirty days of chastity for whoever breaks my command! Where do you  think you’re going?” she purred, pulling on Alto’s arm. “We’ve  got unfinished business.”</p>
<p>“Really now,” she blushed as Rose gave her a deep,  passionate kiss. The “flying menaces” came much faster than  Cirrus had calculated, arriving in a great throng with their wings  beating a foul air and a mockery to the aroma Rose had known till’  now. Half-human, half-bird, deformed and vile monsters with jagged  feathers, talons like the jaws of an anglerfish, their beaks like the  scythe of death, bodies bloated and dripping with blood, their naked  breasts swaying, their voices a horrible screech. <em>Harpy</em> sounded too gentle and distant a description for them, yet these were  not harpies but feathered-folk like Ferrara, but so far removed from  her limited graces that lunacy and depravity would be an improvement.  You or I would have the same reaction to a mutilated sewer-dweller  gleefully enjoying his own torture.</p>
<p>“Do you really think I could talk to them?” Alto  winced. Rose pulled out two guns but kept them from view.</p>
<p>“You could try. I got’cher back.” The former  Queen steadied herself and made a friendly gesture to the devils  above.</p>
<p>“We come in peace! Please, allow us to pass and we  will cause you no further trouble! If it’s provisions you seek,  we’ll gladly share some in the name of goodw— ” She shrieked  and dove for cover as the harpies rained down on her, pelting the  ship and ripping the deck apart with their hideous talons. Rose  cringed and started firing.</p>
<p>“So much for that! Cirrus, Summer, fire at will! The  rest of you, swords out! Don’t shoot unless they’re right in  front of you! They’re too damn fast!” Unfortunately, by saying  “the rest of you”, Rose really meant Alto and Autumn, poor odds  against a host of this multitude. Still, the skies were black with  feathers, flesh, blood, and falling carcasses as the pirates fought  bitterly and bravely. Smoke and fire burst as the ship’s guns kept  the harpies away, while Rose and Alto fought back to back, hacking  and blasting until their arms felt like dead weights. It was  horrible, and it went on for so long that the women nearly felt like  dropping dead.</p>
<p>“Keep shooting!” Autumn cried. “I think we’ve  got em’ on the run! Oh darn, we’re almost out of ammo! I wonder  whose fault that is!”</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me!” Cirrus cried. “I just  maintain whatever we have with us! I’m not in charge of inventory!”</p>
<p>“Well it wasn’t me, and it wasn’t Winter, and  Summer’s in charge of food… Darn! And here comes another one!”</p>
<p>“Wait, don’t shoot! She’s not one of them!”  Autumn felt her blood turn to ice as she jerked her fingers away from  the triggers. She had been a hair’s breadth away from blasting  Cirrus’s lover from the sky. Ferrara had returned from her scouting  at last: a little late, but with impeccable timing. She was like an  eagle thrashing against dragons, a white night to dispel the  darkness, a saint amongst devils, true beauty and purity at last.  Cirrus burst into tears and nearly sang; it was all she could do to  remain at her post and not cover her angel with kisses.</p>
<p>“Mother-fucking ass-wipes! Stay the fuck away from my  friends, you shit-covered cannibals! God-damn devilspawn bitches!  I’ll rip your fucking wings off and throw you to the freakin’  sharks!”</p>
<p>“Boy, it’s really great to hear her voice, isn’t  it?” Autumn winced. Cirrus laughed helplessly.</p>
<p>“I don’t care, she’s still my angel.” Ferrara  finally swooped onto the deck and joined her comrades in the battle.  It was like the police arriving at a robbery: the surviving intruders  scattered almost at once, leaving the others to rot and die. Rose and  Alto made sure there were no stragglers left alive.</p>
<p>“Goddess damn,” the Captain barked as she kicked  the last one in the drink. She took a deep breath and wiped her  forehead. “If I had known we’d run into those ugly bastards…  Shit, I should’ve just asked Miracle to help us. Duchess is gonna  laugh at me for all eternity when I see her again. ‘What’s more  important, Rose: your pride or your life?’ Damn, but that wore me  out.” She looked around her battle-weary crew, waved her sword, and  sat down on the deck. Alto quietly approached and joined her Captain,  resting a loyal head against her.</p>
<p>“That’s just who you are, Rose. And what’s an  adventure without a little danger? Besides, I’ll bet anything our  rivals are having just as hard a time.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“I am bored out of my mind,” Herut groaned. Naja  moaned alongside her.</p>
<p>“You said it, kiddo. I never thought a sea-voyage  would be so outrageously dull. And I’ve been in <em>space</em>. At  least shit happens there.”</p>
<p>“Hello, slackers!” Eve waved as she walked by the  duo, smiling cattily. As usual, she was covered with a mixture of  grease, oil, and lubricant, yet somehow managed to look beautiful—  probably because she was smiling and not sulking. “Why the long  faces? Isn’t this exciting? A real voyage at sea! Can you believe  it? I’ve already got my sea-legs, too! I tell ya, these babies are  paying for themselves!” She stomped her two artificial feet and  beamed; it was a little scary seeing her so chipper.</p>
<p>“What happened to you, sensei?” Herut mumbled. “Did  someone spike your orange juice this morning?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, but that’s not why I’m so happy.  I’ve never even <em>seen</em> the ocean, except from outer space! And  I think I just saw a dolphin!”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t the engine need repairing or something?”  Naja snapped. Eve almost fell over laughing.</p>
<p>“Engine?! You’re joking, right! <em>Engine</em>! Ha,  that’s a good one! This is pure wind driving us, baby! Nothing but  a breeze and a sail! I mean, we’ve got <em>steam</em>, if that’s  what you’re referring to, but we haven’t used it yet, and  besides, Kyrie’s down there making love to it or something. Hey,  look who’s coming up here to join us!!”</p>
<p>“Hello,” said Mink as she toddled along. She gave  Eve one of her indistinguishable glances, twitched her lips, and  leaned against starboard side, absorbing the sea with a Yun’s  appreciation for natural wonder. Eve joined her, still smiling,  overlapping their hands, an expression shared and understood by the  both of them. Herut raised her eyebrow with intrigue, then returned  to being bored</p>
<p>“Oh, so that’s what’s happened. Is everybody  hooking up with everybody here?”</p>
<p>“Present company excluded?” Naja yawned. The  maintenance unit grumbled.</p>
<p>“Shana’s one of the few people on this ship of  fools that actually understands me! Our connection is <em>so</em> on  another level. You wouldn’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Don’t care,” she gestured. Naja stretched and  decided to take another walk around the ship, maybe climb the crow’s  nest or seduce Kyrie. Anything was better than this monotony.  Meanwhile…</p>
<p>“Goodness,” Fuuka paled. It was one thing to watch  someone get seasick; it was another to watch the Acherons go through  it. The truly horrible part was that only Teleah was affected:  Kayleigh bore her sister’s illness with disgust.</p>
<p>“Oh god,” she groaned. “Oh god. And there she  goes again. Oh, god. Fuji-san, could you please…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I always carry some medicine with  me.” She gave it to Teleah and stood back. A few draughts seemed to  have the proper effect, and she thanked the good doctor. “Keep it.  Oh, it must be the worst. Now me, I’ve always lived next to the  ocean, and I couldn’t imagine getting sick. I’m afraid you’ll  just have to get used to it.”</p>
<p>“At least we don’t have to steer,” Teleah  groaned. She drank a few more drops and calmed herself. “Damn, I  hate you, Kay.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m the one with allergies, remember?  Besides, how does a pilot get seasick?”</p>
<p>“Because we’ve never been on a boat that rocks like  this. Ugh…hold on a sec.” She half-emptied the bottle and  wondered if Fuuka had more. Athena kept a firm watch on the horizon  as their small rental ship plied the waves and penetrated into the  heart of the Aegean. According to the natives with them, the  archipelago they were heading into was divided into three main  groups: Cyclades, Dodecanese, and Sporades. Whenever she could, Amy  came up and explained a little of their mythological history: the  Minotaur of Crete, the <em>Iliad</em> and the <em>Odyssey</em>, Sappho’s  poetry (the mere mention of an island called Lesbos attracted  everyone’s attention), the seven wonders of the ancient world, the  Spartan three-hundred, and of course, the parallel journey they were  imitating.</p>
<p>“I guess being a diehard bookworm does have a few  advantages,” Naja admitted. “So even though you’re from Helios  9, you know all this stuff about number three. Damn, I wouldn’t be  surprised if you knew more about it than the natives!”</p>
<p>“I told you, it was all part of my thesis. And I’ve  never actually been to this planet before— or did I mention that? I  think so. Oh, God in Heaven, it’s back! Agh, it hurts! No, no, it’s  all right. I’ve felt worse. But I have to rest now. Ugh— I hope  we don’t run into those crashing rocks.” Rachel helped carry her  master back into her quarters, leaving the others to stew in a grim  pot. Crashing rocks…?</p>
<p>“I wonder what that was about,” Athena muttered.  She looked around for Riene, logically assuming that she who  interpreted Rose’s holo-map would know more about it. Latoli was  playing a game with Shana, and losing very poorly. “Riene,” the  Usagin called, “about that map you interpreted. What did it say  about crashing rocks?”</p>
<p>“Just to beware of them. Your move.”</p>
<p>“Rocks can’t crash together,” Shana answered as  she defeated Riene again. “Since we’re out at sea, all the stones  are attached to the seabed. However, I have heard about primitive  societies that can create a crude engine to move two large stones and  make it seem as if they’re crashing together, but that’s either  for some theatrical performance or security.”</p>
<p>“We have those on Joff,” Mink said. “We use  magnetic forces to pull them around. It’s useful when we have to  clear some land or gather a quarry.”</p>
<p>“There was a word there I couldn’t identify,”  Riene mused. “Simple gates? Sym-pleg? Sympla…I can’t pronounce  it.”</p>
<p>“Symplegades!” Amy exclaimed, bursting back onto  the deck in spite of her injury. Her hair was unkempt and her glasses  were askew. “That’s what they were called! I remember now!  Athena, what do you see?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh— wait a moment. Forgive me, I was  distracted.” She turned her sharp eyes back to the horizon and  turned pale as she saw— and heard— two immense stones perpetually  banging against each other. Before anyone else could notice them, she  called out, “Turn the ship around! We’re going to crash!”</p>
<p>“Like hell!” Kyrie yelled from the engine room.  “The current and the wind are too strong! We’d use up too much  power turning around now.”</p>
<p>“It’s not the current,” Kay said as she peered  over the side. The sail was flat as a board and the water was dead  calm. “We’re being pulled towards it!”</p>
<p>“Oh shit, I hate being right at times like this,”  Naja cursed. “It’s either dull as hell or life-threatening! Why  can’t we ever go somewhere safe <em>and</em> exciting?! But NO, we  have to throw ourselves into the most horrible— ”</p>
<p>“Shut up and help me!” Kyrie shouted. “There  should be some buckets up there! Fill them up and bring them down  here! We need steam— lots of it!”</p>
<p>“Belay that!” Amy exclaimed, hobbling to the bow.  “Slow down but don’t turn around! Kyrie, do you still have that  remote control airplane?”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, it’s with my stuff.”</p>
<p>“Bring it here, Rachel.”</p>
<p>“What are you planning on doing?” Riene said as the  genie scurried away. Amy had that familiar impenetrable look in her  eyes, a warrior’s stare, the same she exhibited whenever the chips  were down.</p>
<p>“Testing the laws of physics. The Argonauts made it  through, and we can too.”</p>
<p>“But that’s just a story,” Eve groaned.</p>
<p>“So explain the rocks.”</p>
<p>“Mediterranean security measures! Probably some  Gigantes-operated checkpoint— I don’t know! The point is, it  doesn’t matter. We can’t risk it.”</p>
<p>“It’s already being risked,” she stated as the  genie returned with a toy airplane. “Thank you, Rachel. Someone  time me! I’m sending it through!”</p>
<p>“You’d better not wreck it,” Kyrie said as she  popped her head out of the engine room. Amy bit her lip and guided  the machine through the rocks, just as they were closing. The plane  reached them as they opened again, and by the time they were opened  all the way, it was halfway through. It made it out with meters to  spare as the rocks crashed again.</p>
<p>“Ten minutes forty-three seconds,” Teleah  announced. “It was going faster than we are now, though.”</p>
<p>“All right. Kyrie, Herut, Eve, get down there and  keep those fires going! Teleah, Kayleigh, take this ship and run her  straight at the rocks! When they close all the way, full speed ahead!  We’ll slip through as they’re opening again and be out long  before they shut. Are you all with me?”</p>
<p>“I can create some more wind if you like,” Rachel  said. “Or I could just stop them from smashing entirely.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Amy smiled, “but let’s see if we  can do this on our own. If it looks as though we’ll be crushed,  then you may come to our rescue.”</p>
<p>“Are you insane, Amy?!” Fuuka screamed. “If it  will increase our chances of survival, we have to stop those rocks  completely! Otherwise, there’s no telling what might happen to us!”</p>
<p>“And what effect might Rachel’s intervention have  if it’s used unnecessarily? Do you operate on a patient who has  just a scratch? No. Only on those who need it. Now trust me!” Fuuka  pouted angrily as Amy ran around directing everyone. There was a time  and place for bravery, but not now, not when everyone’s lives were  at stake. Their rental ship picked up speed, and by now, everybody  could see and hear the smashing rocks. There was still no explanation  offered for their purpose— not that it mattered now. The ship drew  closer and closer as the stones closed, and several women winced as  the bow drew nearer. BOOM— they shut. The ship kept moving. The  stones remained motionless.</p>
<p>“Uh, Amy!!” Riene shouted. Miracle took off her  glasses and started singing loudly.</p>
<p>“Farewell and adieu to you fair Spanish ladies,  farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain! For we have received  orders to sail back to Boston, and ere nevermore will we see you  again!”</p>
<p>“That’s it!” Naja roared. “I’m calling a  mutiny!” But before she could strangle their demented leader, the  rocks opened up again, and the ship slowly wedged through.</p>
<p>“FULL POWER!!” Rachel shouted. She fanned the sails  a little as Kyrie stoked the fires and Herut kept the engine going.  The ship bucked and jumped as it skipped on the waves; water churned  up and slapped against the crew; buckets were being tossed down to  Eve; Amy continued to sing as the stones reached their greatest  width, and came closing in on them. They were halfway through.</p>
<p>“Whoa, fifteen men on a dead man’s chest! Yo-ho-ho  and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil hath done for the rest!  Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!”</p>
<p>“We’re not going to make it!” Shana screamed as  the rocks sped closer. The sun was blotted out and their world grew  dark; the other side seemed distant and cold.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, Rachel! What are you waiting for?”</p>
<p>“Master hasn’t told me to act yet!”</p>
<p>“Who cares?! WE…ARE GOING…TO DIE!!”</p>
<p>“Not yet! Master!” Amy stumbled as her foot  throbbed, and steadied herself on the railing. It took a great deal  of strength to stand up, in that wind and that water, as the ship  bounced and groaned in fright, with the curtains of death closing in  on them.</p>
<p>“Hold fast! We’re not called the Dauntless for  nothing!”</p>
<p>“Now’s not the time to— OH, FUCK!!” Naja wailed  as the walls tightened and smashed against the ship— but no, they  closed too late, as one final burst of power from the engines sent  them flying out, mere centimeters to spare. The whole ordeal had  taken less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>“My god,” Riene heaved, collapsing on the deck as  she caught her breath. “That took years off my life!”</p>
<p>“Let’s not…do that…again,” Naja panted.</p>
<p>“I thought it was fun,” Mink smirked. Eve laughed  at her.</p>
<p>“Freak! Whew, boy…that’ll get the old ticker  going! Is everybody all right?”</p>
<p>“Fuuka’s fainted,” Athena said, stroking the face  of her lover. She glanced over at Miracle, who had finally staggered  under the weight of everything and laid shaking on the deck. She was  beatific in her victory. The Usagin snorted and smiled. Looking back,  it turned out the rocks were part of an elaborate dam, which opened  and closed floodgates at regular intervals in order to power a  generator. If Rachel had stopped those, tens of thousands of people  would’ve been without power, and several might have died. Was that  the reason why…</p>
<p>“Idiots,” Herut moaned. “They’re all idiots,  every last one.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“So what now, fearless leader?” asked Autumn. Rose  smirked.</p>
<p>“Well, we didn’t run into any smashing rocks, so I  wonder if we’ve gone off course. If I knew these waters better, I’d  be able to go there without all these meaningless detours. From what  the natives told me, however, our destination was once a country  called Turkey, somewhere in the European or Middle Eastern regions: I  couldn’t tell which one they meant. I bought a few old maps, but  they don’t help much. This archipelago is loaded.”</p>
<p>“Is it true that a fabled Island of Lesbians is here  somewhere?” Winter gasped.</p>
<p>“You mean Lesbos? I think we should find that out <em>after</em> we get the Golden Fleece. You know, so you girls aren’t  distracted.”</p>
<p>“That could apply to you too, you know!” Summer  exclaimed. Rose shrugged.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Miracle and her bunch are going to check  that out. I didn’t see that pleasure unit of theirs with their  crew, but if she were there… Well, knowing her, she’d sail right  on without even sparing a glimpse. And there’s no way I’ll let  her get the better of me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so it’s pride again,” Autumn smiled. Rose  drew back in mock offense.</p>
<p>“Hey, there’s nothing wrong with a little bit!”  Ferrara soon thrust her head into Rose’s room, announcing that she  had discovered some things that required the Captain’s attention.  Rose grunted as she sat up. “Well, break’s over, girls. Back to  work now.”</p>
<p>“Aww.” The blonde made her way topside and took a  spyglass. The first thing that caught her attention was another boat,  much smaller than theirs but still worthy of their respect, crewed by  women Rose knew very well.</p>
<p>“It’s them,” she said with a smile. “They  managed to catch up with us. I’m not surprised: they’ve got an  excellent crew. Huh, looks like a steam-engine boat. Pretty decent  for a rental.”</p>
<p>“I hope you’re not planning on doing anything  devious,” Alto said. Rose grinned at her first mate wolfishly.</p>
<p>“Relax! Sometimes I really am a woman of my word.  Besides, I haven’t had this much fun in weeks.” She peered back  through her glass and noticed something far more amazing: an enormous  statue of a god chained to a boulder, his face writhing in agony as  an eagle poised above him, ready to strike. Rose’s mouth hung open  as she lowered her glass, wanting to see it in its full glory. No  doubt their rivals were also stunned at the awesome portrayal of  mythology.</p>
<p>“Prometheus chained at the rocks,” Riene whispered.  Her skin shivered and she hugged herself.</p>
<p>“Magnificent,” Mink whispered, her eyes bulging  wide in wonder. Eve held her hand a little tighter.</p>
<p>“You can say that again.” Together, the two ships  sailed past the mighty sculpture, nearly two-dozen women from every  world, society, species, and civilization imaginable, united by a  common purpose and thrust into an era where gods, monsters, and  heroes lived. Not a call or a shot was made between the two as they  sailed past the statue: the world was dead calm, save for the lulling  lap of waves. At last Prometheus was a speck in the horizon behind  them; before them was a wall of solid rock, with a cleft in the  middle broad enough for both vessels to pass through. The wall was so  high that it blocked out the sun and nearly all of the sky as they  coasted through it.</p>
<p>An awed hush fell over both crews, deeper and thicker  than the silence brought on by the statue. They began to realize that  they were being drawn into something: not merely another world, but  another era, another reality, where harpies and crashing rocks are a  living truth— where monsters do exist— where stories become real  and where anything, anything, is possible. The sea carried them  through the passage and into a clearing, where a new silence, full of  awe and wonder, struck every tongue and mouth, so that they could  only gasp and shiver in wonder. They had come to pass through the  barrier between reality and mythology, for the ruins of King Aetes  awaited them.</p>
<p>Every mind realized they were entering a place that had  not been seen for millennia, and if it had, it had been mistaken for  something it was not, hidden behind modern rationalization that such  a world could not be. An adult sees a dragon and thinks “dinosaur”;  they see a one-eyed giant and think “genetic mutation”; they see  ancient magic, harpies, and ruins, and think “theatrics”. But  these mossy stones, weathered and worn and bleached white, were all  quite real; the seas were real as they led the two ships to the old  harbor; the magnificent palace of Aetes was real as it stood  defiantly atop the mightiest hill; the wild grasses and wild trees  were real; the insects were real; the air and sun and surface were  all real. Only a fool could cover their eyes now; the others landed  and knew this land for what it was. Simply put, it was their  Destination.</p>
<p>And there was the Golden Fleece, a mere glint of light  in the far distance, hanging by a tree just as the stories said.</p>
<p>“I…guess it’s a tie,” Rachel said, finally  breaking the long silence. “The contest, I mean. We both came here  first.”</p>
<p>“But the rule was that whoever took the <em>Fleece</em> first wins,” Rose pointed out. Yet in spite of her pirate’s greed  and pirate’s pride, she could not run there and claim it; she could  barely lift her feet at all. A sense of foreboding kept her  paralyzed— it stopped everybody from approaching— a feeling that  if any of them went any further, they would be desecrating this  hallowed land. Either they all moved as a group, or they could not  move at all. They started to move as a group— gingerly, gradually,  as if even now, they felt their presence was a sin.</p>
<p>“Well, no witches or kings,” Miracle murmured. “And  no dragon either.”</p>
<p>“Do you suppose we could just take it and leave?”  Rose wondered. Amy shook her head.</p>
<p>“We must prove ourselves. Coming here was an ordeal,  but it wasn’t enough.”</p>
<p>“What do you propose, then?”</p>
<p>“Just keep walking. We’ll have our opportunity soon  enough.”</p>
<p>“What about the Argonauts? What did they do?” Amy  smiled at her grimly.</p>
<p>“You don’t want to know.”</p>
<p>“You really don’t,” Eve said as she joined them,  Mink at her side. “Say, Kyrie, you left the engine off, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course I did! I’m not an idiot.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying that there’s lots of steam in  the area— in the middle of the afternoon— in the spring.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s steam,” Mink murmured  warily. She pointed to the gathering mist-clouds, which had slowly  been roiling over the ruins ever since the two crews arrived. Athena  drew her sword and stood protectively before Fuuka. The Acherons took  melee weapons and Kyrie lifted her flamethrower. Rose’s pirates saw  what they were doing and drew their weapons.</p>
<p>“Enemies?”</p>
<p>“Fog Ninjas,” Mink answered. “Our ordeal has been  provided.” Rose cursed under her breath and asked Ferrara to start  beating the mist away with her wings; meanwhile, Rachel started  blowing it away, but to no avail. The fog was becoming dangerously  thick and soon everybody was blinded on all sides. The mist-monsters  that sprang forth from this shroud revealed themselves, but now they  used their habitat as a shield, to protect them and hide them as they  struck. Alto felt something sharp slash at her, and jerked aside as  blood spilled from her back. Herut screamed as a shuriken buried  itself in her arm and dissolved. Athena barely managed to attack  before her lover could be impaled.</p>
<p>“Damn it, I can’t see!” Eve shouted. She swung  haphazardly in the fog, angered by her enemy’s laughter. In her  rage she nearly struck the Acheron twins, who glared at her  furiously.</p>
<p>“Watch where you’re going, grease monkey!”</p>
<p>“Like I could in this weather! Damn it, Miracle, ask  Rachel to help out, will ya!”</p>
<p>“I don’t think that will be necessary,” she  murmured eerily. Eve was just about to ask what that meant when a  terrible roar shattered the chaos, and an enormous wall of fire  lunged at them, instantly dispelling the mist. Everyone fell back as  the guardian of the Golden Fleece approached, tearing the ground  asunder in its berserker rage.</p>
<p>“Ohhhh, dear,” Riene whispered. The Fog Ninjas  looked even more puzzled: they had not expected this to interfere  with their work. They could not attack it, for a single swipe of the  dragon’s tail flattened nine of them; its claws could tear three  apart in one stroke, and its breath vaporized nearly all of them.  Their shield was gone and their numbers had been halved, but they  knew no fear and did not retreat unless their master permitted it.  They turned to their enemies and conscripted themselves to battle.</p>
<p>“Trapped between Scylla and Charybdis,” Amy said.</p>
<p>“This is no time for your fucking Gaea-myths!” Naja  screamed as she clawed her way through the fog-monsters. “Either  start fighting or get out of my way!”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll choose both!” Athena roared as she  waded into the teeming masses. Scores of ninja evaporated at her  blade; they slashed and scarred her but she persevered, mowing them  down with blinding rage. Rose, Alto, and Ferrara approached the  dragon, the former Queen lashing with a whip. She slashed one of its  eyes but the creature roared even louder, enraged. Ferrara jumped in  the air as it struck— and again— she dove down and scratched it  with her talons, but was blown away by its scaly wings.</p>
<p>“Go after the Fleece! Take it and let’s get out of  here!”</p>
<p>“I’m not gonna leave you all to fight this bitch by  yourselves! Whoa, look out!!” She pushed Alto out of the way just  as the beast’s tail came crashing down. It screamed and  regurgitated magma; Rachel suddenly swept in and shielded everyone by  raising a slab of rock from the ground.</p>
<p>“Kill that mother-fucker!” Eve shouted. Her rifle  was doing no harm, so she continued to fight the ninjas.</p>
<p>“Not yet! Master hasn’t asked me to!”</p>
<p>“FUCK THAT!! Get rid of him! And help us with these  goddamn Fog Ninjas!”</p>
<p>“Trust me!” Amy shouted as she swung her crutch.  Even she had beaten off a few, but she stumbled and fell to the  ground, her foot bleeding profusely. Kyrie kept them away from her  with her torch while Fuuka ran in to check on her.</p>
<p>“Amy!!!”</p>
<p>“I’m asking you to trust me, Evita Renchina!” Eve  backed away, stunned that she had addressed her like that: not as a  senator’s daughter but as a mechanic’s, the offspring of a good  woman, not some xenophobic rich slob. Her heart broke and she numbly  nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Okay! But you better have a plan!”</p>
<p>“Of course,” she called back. Fuuka didn’t have  very good news: Amy’s wound looked worse than ever, and none of her  treatments had any effect. All she could do was administer  pain-killers and clog it up. Miracle grabbed her suddenly, her  strength failing as she slipped into unconsciousness. “Fuuka…a  spot underneath its left forearm, near the breast… There should be  a weak spot! Have Athena stab it.”</p>
<p>“How would you know that?!” she cried. Miracle  laughed quietly.</p>
<p>“A little hobbit told me. You trust me too, right?”  Fuuka had no choice but to say she did. Besides, Amy had seen them  through disasters before, right? She would deny it, of course, but  not for nothing was she named Miracle. Fuuka left Amy in the care of  Rose’s triplet doctors, then rushed to tell Athena the news.</p>
<p>“You realize that’s suicidal,” she said— but  then smirked. “But I might be the only one who can pull it off. All  right, I’ll give it a shot, but I’ll need a distraction.” She  turned around, stabbed a stray ninja, then rushed at the dragon with  a scream. Fuuka didn’t know what else to do, so she decided to  dance and wave her arms around wildly.</p>
<p>“Come on, dragon! Here’s a delicious fox-girl for  you! Doesn’t she look scrumptious? A perfect meal for a lordly  dragon! Look at me, you filthy serpent!”</p>
<p>“What the hey?” Naja muttered, smiling grimly. “Has  she lost her mind?”</p>
<p>“I’m not complaining,” Rose purred. “Damn, I  think I’ve been ogling the wrong girl. Alto, we seriously need to  kidnap a Kitsune if we find one.”</p>
<p>“Focus on the fight, Miss one-track mind,” she  grumbled. The dragon’s attention was drawn to Fuuka just long  enough for Athena to act. As he raised himself up to lunge at her,  the Usagin quickly darted in, found the chink in his scaly armor, and  plunged her sword in all the way to the hilt. The monster roared and  recoiled violently. Athena had no time to pull it out, so she made a  run for it. The beast collapsed like a mountain, shattering the ruins  and tumbling into the sea, where it was lost to the deep. The  remaining Fog Ninjas appeared to be stunned, and a few wondered if  they really should retreat. Fortunately, they didn’t need to make a  decision: everyone surrounded and destroyed them first. Whew.</p>
<p>“Down I go,” Riene said as she collapsed. Everyone  took several minutes to breathe and rest from the intense battle.  Fuuka and the three doctors took less time, however, since there were  plenty of injuries to heal: bruises, scratches, cuts, and more than a  few burns. Amy had passed out from blood loss, while Athena stood  quietly where the dragon fell, mourning the loss of her sword. Fuuka  had given it to her, and it had seen her through many battles.</p>
<p>“Farewell, dear friend Morisato,” she whispered.  “Be at peace now. Sorry, Fuuka.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay,” she smiled warmly. “It’s only a  sword. We can get you a new one.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but it was <em>our</em> sword.” She smiled  helplessly and nuzzled her dearest one. Suddenly, Ferrara jumped up,  shouting.</p>
<p>“I completely forgot! So long, losers! Long live the  Dead Roses!” Before anyone could stop her, she flew up to the tree  and snatched the Golden Fleece, laughing proudly. Herut pinched the  bridge of her nose in frustration.</p>
<p>“Like I said before, they’re nothing but a bunch of  idiots.”</p>
<p>“And you’re the fool for going along with them,”  Shana giggled. She snuggled up next to her friend and kissed her  cheek; Herut turned red and glanced away sheepishly. Rachel let out a  little moan as she flew over the two parties.</p>
<p>“I guess this means my master’s staying the night  with you, huh?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Rose smiled, “but we’ll let her stay  with you all for awhile. I want Miracle good and rested when she  enters my bedchambers!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Nearly everybody spent the night restlessly, waiting  and worrying about their fearless leader. Of course Amy would keep  her word: there was no question about it. Even if it meant  surrendering herself to the whims of a lustful pirate, Amy would  choose her duties over her desires: that was the kind of person she  was. They could be grateful, at least, that she was not headed into  any special danger— in fact, for some of the crew, the thought of  being loved by Rose, and presumably the rest of her pirates,  certainly sounded pleasant enough. But Amy had made it very clear she  only gave her heart to men, and while it became a comic punchline  whenever this line was crossed (by now, at least half the crew had  kissed her, and a handful had been even more intimate), nobody should  be forced to deviate from their choice of lifestyle. It was as awful  a thought as asking Chandra to give up seduction, or Fuuka her anime,  or Kyrie her inventions.</p>
<p>Rachel, Naja, Herut, and the Acherons were the only  ones that spent the night in relative peace. Naja couldn’t help but  laugh at Miracle’s predicament, while Rachel trusted that all would  be well and Herut didn’t care either way. Fuuka tossed in bed and  stopped counting sheep after an hour; she decided to take a walk to  calm her nerves. Shana was burning through puzzles and works of art  like a woman possessed: she kept herself frantically busy so she  wouldn’t let her imagination run wild. Eve double and  triple-checked everything on the ship, Riene worked out at the gym,  Mink and Kyrie assisted with the repairs, and Athena stepped outside  to practice with a bokken. Fuuka dropped by later with a towel and  some water.</p>
<p>“You’ve changed,” she smiled. Athena glanced at  her curiously.</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“You’re worried about Amy.”</p>
<p>“What about it?” Fuuka giggled and put her arms  around her lover.</p>
<p>“Because normally you’re only worried about me. You  don’t trust easily.” Athena performed three more swings before  resting. She ran long fingers over her face and ears.</p>
<p>“I see what you mean. I’ve been thinking a little  about that myself. I thought I came out here because I was restless  like you, but…well, maybe I am concerned.”</p>
<p>“You’re so unfair,” she said, kissing her cheek.  “It took you more than a year to trust little old me, and only half  that time to warm up to Amy.”</p>
<p>“Only because you were such an important figure in my  life,” she replied, smiling gently. Fuuka drew back a little,  glowing in the soft darkness, and untied the sash around her  nightgown.</p>
<p>“So I had that great an influence on you, eh? And  speaking of important figures…” She beamed for joy as she let her  robe slide off; the Kitsune was nude underneath. Athena drew back,  blushing, stricken with awe by Fuuka’s beauty and bold behavior.  The Kitsune approached her lover with sweet seduction in her eyes as  she put her arms around Athena’s neck and began undressing her.</p>
<p>“Make love with me, darling. Right here. Right now.”</p>
<p>“Yessss,” Athena hissed, her body tingling with the  cool air and dewy grass. They fell to the ground and began rolling,  kissing, caressing, moaning. Fuuka was in heaven until she noticed  someone approaching them through the clearing. She and Athena both  froze, comically stuck in the middle of lover’s business, as they  stared at their intruder. It was Amy Miracle.</p>
<p>“Uh…I’m back.” The awkward silence hovered for  another moment or two.</p>
<p>“Yes. Yes you are.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult rousing everyone so they could  hear Amy’s story— but her tale was so anticlimactic that everyone  wondered why they were even bothered.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she grinned sheepishly. “I don’t have  any juicy gossip to share. The truth is that Rose Gillian is a true  lady at heart and a wonderful romantic. She may fool around, but her  heart’s gone completely over to Queen Alto— she even gave her the  Golden Fleece. I can only assume that was her plan all along, so  let’s not have any hard feelings.”</p>
<p>“Are you serious?! She didn’t try anything <em>at  all</em>?”</p>
<p>“No. We just talked all night and she took me on a  tour of her ship. Well, she did kiss me, but really, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“And another one,” Kyrie grumbled. “Damn it, what  does she have that I don’t?!”</p>
<p>“Sanity?” Shana offered.</p>
<p>“The ability to express herself without burning  anything?” Athena muttered.</p>
<p>“Me?” Rachel pointed. Naja crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“So I guess this means we went through another world  of trouble for nothing. You know, I’m sorely tempted to leave this  ship and get my wedding over with. I’m actually that aggravated. My  god, I never thought it would come to that.”</p>
<p>“Stay those wedding vows, my serpentine friend!”  Amy cried out wildly. “The Dead Rose saw fit to give us a  consolation prize! Not for <em>free</em>, of course— there were  negotiations made— but I figured you all deserved something for  your time. I was willing to pay.”</p>
<p>“Pay?” Amy nodded and blushed. “Oh. So what do we  get?”</p>
<p>“Why, the other treasures, of course!” she  exclaimed. “Or did you think Rose’s small crew could carry them  all?”</p>
<p>“Great, leftovers,” Naja grunted. But she had seen  that pile; there were more riches than the Golden Fleece in those  ruins, enough for three ships. She sighed and gave Amy an apologetic  smile. “Still, it’s better than nothing. You did good. Thanks.”  And with that rare expression of gratitude, the Elshyrin slithered  away, leaving behind a dozen stunned women.</p>
<p>“Did Naja just…<em>thank</em> someone?” The  Acherons rubbed their eyes. “We have now officially seen  everything.”</p>
