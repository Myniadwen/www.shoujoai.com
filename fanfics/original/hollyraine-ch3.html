<h1>The Misadventures of Holly-Raine (part 3 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hollyraine-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Cassie still couldn&#146;t believe it. Summer had invited her to her birthday 
party. It was unimaginable. Maybe she and Jenny even regarded her as a 
friend? Who knew? But at least, Cassie was glad to have been invited. Of 
course, she had nothing to wear, and clothes would be a necessity (duh!) 
but Cassie had more than enough money put away from her after school 
job. 

The blonde dug around in her gym bag. Though she hated Gym with a fiery 
passion that outshined hell itself, it was a necessary evil. It was the 
only lesson she was bad at, and worse was that it  was a lesson that she 
didn&#146;t take with Holly She had opted for swimming in her gym class (give 
you three guesses why) while Cassie was sick on the day the year had 
been given the option. So she was stuck with the only thing that had a 
space left, which was softball. Cassie hated it. She more than made a 
fool of herself out on that grassy field, swinging a bat aimlessly at a 
ball. Sometimes she felt that she would die of embarrassment every time 
she was picked last for a team. 

Still, she had no choice. Academic spirit demanded that she at least try 
her best. What more could she do? Cassie slowly slipped out of her 
normal clothes (her staple flowery dress and flip-flops) and dressed 
herself in the gym kit her mother had pack for her in the morning. The 
young girl quickly pulled the white shorts up both her thin legs, and 
pulled the white top over her small chest. She wasn&#146;t too comfortable 
with her own nakedness, either. And all though she was the first to get 
dressed, the other girls all left the changing rooms before her. Well, 
so she believed. Cassie waited until the last girl she saw left, then 
stood up to follow them. They were all headed to the softball pitch to 
start this period&#146;s lesson. Though Cassie wanted to waste as *much* time 
as possible, Couch Jeffers was a real bear when it came to tardiness. Of 
course, out of all the faculty members, she was all muscle and no brain. 
Hard-headedness was a given when dealing with that teacher. 

Cassie stood to leave, and walked over to the doors that lead out into 
the grass fields. But before she even left, her ears picked up on the 
sound of mocking sniggers. Cassie looked back to see who was doing that, 
but then wished that she would have walked away when she saw the girl. 

Of all people, it had to be... 

&quot;S-Shannon.&quot; Cassie said with a tremor in her voice &quot;It&#146;s you...&quot;

The contemptuous, foul-mouthed and cocky girl with the &#145;dirty blonde&#146; 
hair, Shannon, made her presence known. She, like Cassie, was dressed up 
in a pure white sports outfit, just for softball, but where Cassie 
looked puny in it, Shannon made it look glorious. Her larger breasts 
were in deep contrast to Cassie&#146;s smaller ones, and her long, shapely 
legs follow the same idea in comparison to Cassie&#146;s thin ones. 

Suddenly, Cassie felt like a mouse. Shannon was one of those popular 
trendies. And she seemed to enjoy every bit of power that status gave 
her. Conceited, stuck-up, rude, and well, just plain bitchy. Aside from 
her authoritative movie-star looks and sexy cerulean eyes, Shannon 
didn&#146;t have much going for her (in terms of personality). Though others 
might have disagreed, Cassie felt dwarfed by her Shannon had looks, 
popularity (though lord knows why), and seemed to be everything that 
Cassie wasn&#146;t. In fact, Cassie was a little afraid of her. Not from 
physical violence, but from the fact that she was too intimidated by 
Shannon to put the girl in her place. 

Shannon was well aware of this. &quot;Hey Cassie. You&#146;re looking well. I see 
you didn&#146;t stuff your bra today.&quot;

Cassie looked downwards. &quot;I-I never do... that...&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#146;s okay,&quot; Shannon tossed her hair, walking forward 
seductively. &quot;Pancake-chested girls like you need all the help they can 
get. We can&#146;t all be gorgeous.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot; Cassie hated herself inside for swallowing that kind of crap 
from Shannon. But words, meaningless as they are, had scary effects to 
some people. It frightened her to know that she once had a crush on such 
a superficial person.  &quot;I ... should be going now...&quot;

Shannon didn&#146;t move to stop her, but kneeled downwards and leaned into 
Cassie&#146;s bag when she turned her back. Cassie was just about to head 
into the softball field, until she heard something that made her freeze 
with fear

&quot;O, unforeseeable fate, can&#146;t thou hand me my prize? I stand alone in 
the realm of shadows, longing for the sweet touch of my precious My 
precious Holly-Raine. My tears leak endlessly as I see her only in my 
dreams, and my heart burns sadly as my fingers perform that which I 
desire Holly to do Please, fate, give me my angel...&quot;

Cassie turned back instantly. &quot;Don&#146;t read that! Please, Shannon!&quot;

Shannon burst into laughter as she read a few excepts from Cassie&#146;s 
poetry diary. But while she did that, it was all Cassie could do to keep 
from crying. Nobody was ever supposed to see that book. It was one of 
the few outlets for her passion. And now, Shannon had violated that. And 
at the same time, she had discovered the crush that Cassie had for 
Holly-Raine. Her deepest, darkest secret. 

Shannon continued to giggle. &quot;Oh, Cassie. You crack me up. To think, all 
this time, you&#146;ve had a thing for Holly. Poor baby! Now I understand why 
you were so desperate to get into Holly&#146;s swimming class Hoping to check 
her out in a swimsuit, were you? I bet the thought of that really gets 
your &#145;fluids flowing&#146; if you know what I mean.&quot;

Cassie felt like she could just die from embarrassment. &quot;Please give me 
that back.&quot;

&quot;Come and get it.&quot; 

And from that saying of that, Cassie gulped. She was so intimidated by 
Shannon that she could barely keep her knees from knocking. But through 
fear, Cassie stepped forward, foot-by-foot, till she came in close with 
Shannon. As she reached out to get it, Shannon dropped the book, grabbed 
Cassie by the shoulders, then forced her into the lockers of the 
changing room. Cassie gasped suddenly, her cheek meeting with cool 
metal, but was even more shocked as she felt Shannon&#146;s form pressing 
closely into her body. Shannon&#146;s hips melted into Cassie&#146;s, her large 
breasts pressing into Cassie&#146;s back . And more shock followed, as Cassie 
felt Shannon&#146;s breath against her ear. 

Shannon spoke leisurely and lustfully. &quot;Holly might not be so forgiving 
when she hears you&#146;ve been writing about her. What would she say, I 
wonder? What would the rest of the school say?&quot;

Cassie&#146;s eyes were wide with shock . &quot;Please! Don&#146;t say anything! 
Please, Shannon!&quot;

Shannon grinned deviously, then curled her tongue into Cassie&#146;s ear. The 
shorter girl squirmed, her breath short and heart pounding. Shannon 
always made Cassie&#146;s skin crawl, but now, she felt somehow... calm. But 
that couldn&#146;t be right. She loved Holly.

&quot;I&#146;m very good at keeping my mouth shut.&quot; Shannon said, withdrawing her 
tongue. &quot;As long as I have an incentive. Just be nice to me.&quot;

Chills were running up and down Cassie&#146;s spine. &quot;N-Nice?&quot;

&quot;Oh c&#146;mon,&quot; The taller girl whispered. &quot;You know what I mean. You&#146;ve 
wanted to do it to Holly over and over again. I&#146;ve seen the way you look 
at her. You used to look at me like that, didn&#146;t you?&quot;

That was true. Cassie remembered those times with some shame. She had 
first seen Shannon nearly two years at a burger place, and had been 
bewildered by Shannon&#146;s good looks. Of course, when Shannon transferred 
into Atlantic High, it was revealed that the personality didn&#146;t reflect 
those looks Shannon was as bitchy as she was beautiful. Which made it 
easy for Cassie to slip out of the crush she had on Shannon. It took a 
couple months though. And through those months, Cassie was faced with a 
fixation similar to her current one on Holly-Raine. But she had no idea 
that Shannon had known of her crush. Was Cassie really that obvious?

Shannon intently watched Cassie&#146;s neck as she took a moment to think. 
With a throbbing at her heart and her crotch, Shannon watched the nape 
of Cassie&#146;s neck rise and fall with every hurried breath. She watched 
the sliver necklace roll away and back as Cassie&#146;s soft flesh continued 
to pulse. It was obvious that Cassie was struggling to take this all in. 
But Shannon didn&#146;t see that as an obstacle. She saw it as an opening. 

The girl with the dirty blonde hair lunged for that smooth neck, 
nibbling along its tender flesh. Cassie froze with a start, then felt 
herself melt into it. Her eyes slipped shut, her heartbeat raced, and 
her mind ran a mile a minute, as Shannon continued to suckle and bite at 
her neck. Shannon made her way downwards, to Cassie&#146;s collarbone, 
leaving a trail of reddish bite marks and idle saliva in her wake. One 
last kiss was placed against Cassie&#146;s collarbone, before Shannon pulled 
back. To go any further she&#146;d have to remove that damn gym shirt. Cassie 
felt relieved yet at the same time disappointed that the taller blonde 
had stopped what she was doing. But that made no sense. She loved Holly, 
her Holly. Cassie had been in love with Holly-Raine for so long now, why 
would Shannon still excite her like this?

Even Shannon noticed Cassie&#146;s indecision. It was written all over her 
face

&quot;Thinking about her, aren&#146;t you?&quot; Shannon said, &quot;She doesn&#146;t give a damn 
about you, Cassie. She doesn&#146;t give a damn. She&#146;ll never look at you 
that way.&quot;

&quot;But ... I ...&quot; 

Shannon&#146;s hand slowly wound up to the buttons that were trying up the 
front half of Cassie&#146;s shirt. Had Cassie not have been so bamboozled by 
all that was happening, she might have had the foresight to realize that 
Shannon wanted more. 

Shannon continued to unbutton Cassie&#146;s shirt while she spoke. &quot;You know 
I&#146;m right. I bet Holly doesn&#146;t even know who you are. Why chase after a 
girl like that? She&#146;ll never have eyes for you.&quot;

Cassie opened her eyes. &quot;H-Holly...&quot;

&quot;You can say her name a billion times,&quot; Shannon&#146;s hands moved down to 
the band holding up Cassie&#146;s gym shorts. &quot;But she&#146;ll never love you And 
if I tell her about your little notebook, it&#146;ll prove that. You want 
that? You want me to tell her?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Cassie said, her voice was shaking from both fear and arousal. 
&quot;Please don&#146;t. Please don&#146;t do that. I&#146;m begging you&quot;

Shannon grinned &quot;That&#146;s what I like to hear. You&#146;ve always been mine, 
Cassie Robbins. Did you really think I&#146;d let airhead Holly-Raine slobber 
all over you? No way. You&#146;re all mine. Say it. Say that you&#146;re all 
mine.&quot;

Cassie&#146;s head lulled to the side, heat running up and down her body, 
peaking at the areas at which Shannon administered her delicate but 
lusciously possessive touch. She couldn&#146;t even think clearly. Suddenly, 
all she could think about was Shannon&#146;s touch. How she had desired this, 
those past years ago. How she so greatly desired this from Holly. How 
light and delicate that touch made her and how reluctant she was to pull 
away. What did that make her? She couldn&#146;t rightly claim to love Holly 
then get thrilled by a virtual bimbo-bully groping her up in the locker 
room... could she? 

What did this mean?

Shannon left Cassie to mentally remonstrate with herself, while she took 
action. The older girl pulled her hands upwards, over the smoothness of 
Cassie&#146;s navel, then under the fabric of the gym shirt. With hurried 
glee, those two hands sought out their prize. Cassie gasped with 
astonishment and unexpected delight as Shannon cupped both of her small 
breasts into both palms. The younger blonde breathed in quickly and 
harshly, unable to gather all the emotions swirling in her head. It was 
all she could do to just go with the flow. Shannon began a slow, firm 
kneading of both mounds. Though Shannon looked to be a mindless clothes 
freak of the trendies, she knew her way around the female body. A fact 
that Cassie was starting to learn first hand. Cassie&#146;s sky blue eyes 
blinked and rolled in their sockets, while her head titled back onto 
Shannon&#146;s shoulder Shannon grinned when her fingers started to playing 
with Cassie&#146;s nipples. They were as stiff as ocean rock. That spoke 
volumes. 

&quot;Say it, Cassie,&quot; Shannon barked, &quot;Tell me that you&#146;re mine.&quot;

Cassie mumbled to herself, barely noticing anything aside from the 
glorious feel of Shannon dainty fingertips, plucking at her sensitive 
nubs. &quot;I&#146;m... I&#146;m...&quot;

&quot;Say it!&quot;

&quot;I-I&#146;m... I&#146;m yours!&quot; She finally declared. &quot;I belong to you! 
Please...Shannon... just...&quot;

The taller woman placed a kiss on the shorter girl&#146;s shoulder. &quot;That&#146;s 
good. I knew you&#146;d admit one day. Now, sweetness, turn around.&quot;

Shannon finally pulled away from Cassie, dragging her hands away from 
the other blonde&#146;s breasts and stepped away. Cassie stood still for a 
moment, then swung around and faced her &#145;owner&#146;, Shannon. 

&quot;You sweet little thing.&quot; Shannon placed a solitary fingertip to her 
lips. &quot;Take off your clothes. They&#145;re bothering me.&quot; 

Cassie&#146;s face was flushed with embarrassment, her heart was pounding 
relentlessly, and her eyes were trained on both doors leading into the 
changing rooms, but she did as she was tolled. Cassie slowly crossed her 
arms over her waist, clasping her shirt. In one motion, she pulled the 
article over her head and put it down by her gym bag. Her hands then 
went down to her waist. From Shannon&#146;s earlier actions, her gym shorts 
had already been slipped down, revealing the edge of the band that 
belonged to her pink coloured panties. She would have been more 
self-conscious by that, if not for the fact that Shannon was about to 
see her panties in their entirety. Cassie pulled down the shorts in the 
same way, further stimulating Shannon&#146;s lust and imagination. Cassie 
stepped out of them, while kicking off her shoes and socks. 

Cassie looked at Shannon and gave her a look that begged &#145;is this 
enough?&#146; but was responded to with a look that said, &#145;not a chance&#146;. 
Cassie sighed, then worked her arms around her back to unclip her bra. 
It was loose already, again, thanks to Shannon&#146;s fun and games, so 
popped off easily, falling into the rest of Cassie&#146;s clothes pile. Last 
to go was her panties. Cassie worked her thumbs under the material of 
the pink underwear, keeping her wide eyes on Shannon, then slowly 
brought them down. Cassie was completely unaware of how wet this made 
Shannon. But her own wetness was now in complete view.

Shannon smiled at the sight of Cassie&#146;s wetness, glistening off the 
faint blonde of her pubic hairs. &quot;You get off on this, don&#146;t you? Being 
told what to do.&quot;

Cassie remained still. It was cold. And embarrassing. But having Shannon 
watching her nakedness was somehow... a turn on. Shannon walked forward, 
moving up to Cassie so that they were locked in closeness again. The 
powerful Shannon loomed over an innocent Cassie, her eyes burning with a 
carnivorous hunger.  With one push, she forced Cassie against the cold 
metal of the lockers. Cassie opened her mouth to protest, but was 
silenced with Shannon&#146;s before she had the chance. The dominating girl 
thrust her tongue into Cassie&#146;s unusually willing mouth, probing and 
darting. Shannon&#146;s tongue explored and invaded the warm innards of 
Cassie&#146;s mouth, flicking against her newfound lover&#146;s tongue. Cassie 
remained still, while Shannon claimed her. She loved Holly so much, but 
why couldn&#146;t she resist Shannon? Why was Cassie allowing herself to be 
taken by a woman that had gone out of he way to make her miserable? And 
why did her reluctance fade every time Shannon touched her? 

Shannon moaned in Cassie&#146;s mouth, dragging her tongue around and about. 
Her hands went on the move, reaching up to both of Cassie&#146;s newly freed 
breasts. Cassie sighed breathlessly into Shannon&#146;s forceful kiss as both 
of her mounds were seized with fervour. This time the touch was more 
frank, Shannon&#146;s hands erratically took what they wanted, pinching 
Cassie&#146;s taut nipples. Cassie squirmed internally and externally Her 
body was being claimed by a girl she had believed she hated. 

And she loved every second of it. 

But what did that mean for her feelings for Holly? Still, Cassie could 
not concentrate on that. Shannon gave off a light moan as she 
nonchalantly retracted her tongue from Cassie&#146;s mouth, ending their 
kiss. Shannon gave her a dark grin, then lowered herself, releasing 
Cassie&#146;s nips with a twist She slid down Cassie&#146;s body, inch by inch, 
until she came face to face with Cassie&#146;s wet opening. As soon as she 
felt Shannon&#146;s warm breath against her most private area, the blonde 
looked downwards. Her body trembled as she saw and felt Shannon pull 
apart both of her lower lips, spreading open the gateway to a woman&#146;s 
most sacred place. 

&quot;Aaaah!&quot;

Cassie screamed with passion as Shannon&#146;s mouth lunged into her crotch, 
her tongue grazing a sensitive clit. She juddered, bucked and moaned, 
desperately struck by the stimulus of her love spot by the dominating 
Shannon. It was more than she was prepared for. She had written about 
this moment over and over, but never thought it would be like this. 
Cassie thoughtlessly grabbed two bundles of Shannon&#146;s dirty blonde hair, 
and forced her hips closer to her lover&#146;s mouth. Her dreaming of Holly 
seemed so distant now, as she was brought to a powerful release... 

***********

Cassie slammed her notebook shut.  She had forgotten that she had 
brought her &#145;Shannon&#146; notebook to school today, not her &#145;Holly-Raine&#146; 
one. It was a mistake, she had meant to carry the other one with her, 
but must have mixed it up with this one. Even though that story was 
nearly two years old,  it still made Cassie shudder. She had edited it a 
couple times, to include Holly in there, the original copy held no 
mention of her (since Cassie really didn&#146;t know of Holly-Raine back 
then). 

Cassie looked up from her position on the locker room bench. She had 
fallen over during softball (much to the humour of Shannon and her 
group, in reality, Shannon didn&#146;t give a damn about Cassie) and so Coach 
Jeffers sent her to the showers Cassie didn&#146;t really have much to do 
here except read her poetry diary, and as it turns out, it was the one 
she had written for Shannon. Even though it was more-or-less complete 
fiction, it did present one thing that was true to Cassie&#146;s heart. That 
unexplainable attraction. Why she had ever been devoted to such a 
heartless woman was beyond her. But Cassie felt like the hopelessness of 
her crush on Shannon seemed so similar to the hopelessness of her crush 
on Holly-Raine. 

Cassie&#146;s deepest worry was that nothing would become of her feelings. 
Just like her feelings for Shannon. Which was why she had to act soon. 
No more playing around, trying to catch a glimpse of her during a class 
or, trying in vain to sit next to her at lunch. If Cassie was going to 
make this work, she had do to something now.
