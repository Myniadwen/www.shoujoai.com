KC

&quot;Kristen Carty, Age: 18, 11th grade post secondary school.&quot; The 
councillor looked up from the papers she just read, at the teen that sat 
across from her. In all the years Miss. Thomson had been a councillor 
this was the first time she had ever encountered a student quite like 
this one. The student stood a little over 5&#39; 5&quot;, had wavy, short cut, 
copper red hair, and cold, emotionless eyes. 

The girl - Miss. Thomson was sure it was a girl - wore a tight, black, 
leather jacket with zippers up the sleeves, a white t-shirt and jeans. 
Jeans so faded and worn that there was a huge hole showing off most of 
her right knee. A silver eagle hung around her neck on a bright, silver 
chain and a black Ankh with a silver star inlaid on the surface dangled 
from her left ear while a silver stud decorated her right. Freckles 
sprinkled across her pale, boyish face and she looked a lot younger then 
her years. Miss. Thomson found the new student&#39;s looks far from amusing. 
After taking another look at the file, she reconsidered saying anything 
just yet. &quot;Um, Is that all correct?&quot;

Kris nodded slowly, &quot;I like to be called Kris, please.&quot; She clenched the 
eagle tightly in her hand until the wings cut into her hands. She wanted 
nothing more then to bolt from the room. She hated being interrogated by 
school officials, all the same she knew that if she was going to get 
back in to school that she was going to have to fight for it. 

&quot;I see. It also says here you tried to commit suicide and were just 
released from the county  psychiatric hospital. Is that also correct?&quot;

Again the girl slowly nodded, clenching the necklace tighter. She could 
feel the councillor&#39;s eyes begin to burn into her. Kris kept her eyes on 
the desk that sat before her, and the objects that were lying there. A 
pen caught her eye; she began to take it apart with her mind, 
visualizing every side and every angle from how the sun from the window 
reflected off the metal clip to the wood grain in the casing.

Miss. Thomson waved a hand in front of the child&#39;s eyes. &quot;Miss Carty? 
You there?&quot;

With a blink, Kris returned her attention to the woman across from her. 
&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Kris apologized.

&quot;Are you going to be alright? I mean..&quot; Miss. Thomson added with a fake 
note of concern and a flick of her tongue.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kris finally let got of the eagle and set her cold eyes 
on the councillor, &quot;Yesterday was yesterday and today is today. I&#39;m no 
longer the person I used to be, and I have no plans to die anytime soon 
if that is what you want to know.&quot; Her eyes were void of all emotion. 
Any pain that might have been there before was gone.

&quot;Yes, I see.. how can we be certain that you won&#39;t-&quot; The councillor 
began, but she was suddenly cut off when Kris abruptly stood.

&quot;You won&#39;t be, and neither will I. But I promised someone I&#39;d live, and 
that is what I plan to do.&quot; She was getting sick of people talking down 
to her like she was a child all the time. She was very aware of what she 
did and didn&#39;t need to be reminded about it every passing day. 

&quot;It also says here that you got into many fights. Have you thought about 
trying to not be an instigator?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean by that? I didn&#39;t do anything to those kids. They 
attacked me.&quot; Kris said, getting upset by the accusations, &quot;The judge 
let me go. I didn&#39;t do anything wrong.&quot; 

&quot;Well...&quot; The councilor clicked her tongue again and looked Kris over, 
&quot;Have you ever thought about changing the way you dress?&quot; 

&quot;Why? What&#39;s wrong with my clothes? I like this jacket.&quot; The girl looked 
herself over trying to see why the woman would ever think of changing. 
Her cousin gave her the jacket to protect her and that it had. The 
leather was getting cracked and old, nevertheless that was the way she 
liked it. The jeans were her favourite, they were so well worn from 
practising dance and covered in paint. They fit perfectly.   

&quot;Uh... but..&quot; Miss. Thomson began, stopping when Kris set those eyes 
back on her.

&quot;But what?&quot; The teen&#39;s tone was flat, but held an edge to it. It was 
almost like she wanted the councillor to try and continue the argument.

Miss. Thomson finally gave in. &quot;Nothing.&quot;

&quot;That is what I thought,&quot; Kris said calmly while placing her hands in 
her pockets, &quot;Is that all?&quot; 

&quot;N.. no...&quot; Miss. Thomson was visibly nervous, &quot;W welcome to Westmire 
High School. You&#39;ll have morning art class as home room. Which will 
be... Class 109.&quot; She double checked and nodded.

&quot;Thanks, now can I go?&quot; Kris wanted nothing more then to escape this 
woman&#39;s gaze. It felt like her eyes were crawling over her and made the 
girl shiver. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Miss. Thomson stood up from her chair, &quot;I hope you enjoy your 
stay here.&quot;

 &quot;I hope so too.&quot; Kris grabbed her art portfolio, which leaned against 
the foot of her chair, before turning on the heels of her shoes and left 
the room.

Kris walked out of the guidance councillors office area and down the 
school hall. Everything was silent except for the sound of her shoes on 
the tile floor. No one would be at school until tomorrow, when the new 
school year started up again. She couldn&#39;t be happier, because she could 
feel her grip was loosening with every step she took. Seeing the girl&#39;s 
rest room she took a deep breath and ducked out of sight of the world&#39;s 
eye.

As soon as the washroom door banged shut the tears began to fall. Kris 
tried hard to keep them at bay, but was quickly losing. She leaned 
against the wall and let her tears flow. Everything became washed out as 
her eyes overflowed with tears. Finally, she couldn&#39;t stand the thought 
of someone stumbling upon her like that so the girl staggered over to 
the sink and splashed water on her face and through her hair. The 
coldness snapped her back into reality and she was finally able to force 
the tears back. She leaned over the counter and stared at herself in the 
mirror. Her eyes were red when compared to her pale white skin and she 
knew if anyone saw her on the way back home, they would probably ask if 
she was alright and want to help and right now human interaction was 
something she could do without.

Opening her portfolio, Kris found a pair of circular mirrored 
sunglasses. They were her favourite, because they were a gift from a 
very special person that Kris held close to her heart. She held the 
glasses to her chest and whispered to herself, &quot;I won&#39;t let them win. 
I&#39;ll live on for you, I promise you that.&quot; She slipped the glasses over 
her eyes and prepared to leave when something in the mirror caught her 
attention.

There, standing beside Kris, was the white form of a young girl with 
long flowing hair and a beautiful white gown. The figure reached out and 
placed one hand upon the mirror. Kris proceeded to mimic the ghostly 
reflection when the door to the washroom banged open.

Kris spun around to see another girl about her own age standing at the 
rest room door. For a moment the two just stared at each other. &quot;What 
are you doing in here?&quot; The new girl asked in disgust.

Kris just blinked, not sure just how much this newcomer had seen.

&quot;Can&#39;t you read the sign, stupid?!? This is the girl&#39;s washroom!!!&quot; She 
held the door opened and pointed out of the room, &quot;Now get out of here!&quot; 
She almost spat. 

Kris took one last glance at the mirror, only to be greeted with her own 
image. She turned back to the other girl, shrugged and casually walked 
out of the rest room.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to say anything?&quot; The girl yelled frustrated as Kris 
started down the hall.

Kris slowly turned to face her accuser. The girl wasn&#39;t much taller than 
herself, but mother nature was proving to be kinder to her. She had 
brown hair that was pulled back into a pony tail so her soft round face 
was free of anything obscuring it from view. She wore a pleated plaid 
skirt, white shirt, a small tie, knee length socks and black runners. 
Kris looked the girl over one time, then returned back to the girl&#39;s 
eye. &quot;What is to be said?&quot; Kris said calmly, almost as if she didn&#39;t 
really care.

Angry, the pony-tailed girl stomped over to Kris, &quot;Who do you think you 
are? You walk into the girl&#39;s washroom and think you can just walk away 
without having to explain yourself?&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s to explain? Can&#39;t a girl use the girl&#39;s washroom?&quot; She looked 
over the rims of her glasses, deep into the other girl&#39;s brown eyes. &quot;Or 
do you have to look like a girl in order to use the girl&#39;s washroom now 
a days?&quot; She put her hands in her jean pockets causing her jacket to 
open to show her body a little more.

Startled by Kris&#39;s gaze, the girl stepped back and glanced down at how 
Kris&#39;s white t-shirt clung tightly revealing her rather athletic form 
and small chest, &quot;Uh no.. .I mean...&quot; The girl blushed and stammered, 
suddenly realizing that maybe she was the one at fault. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
just thought..&quot; She said as her eyes dropped to the floor.

&quot;I know what you thought.&quot; Kris said running a hand through her damp 
hair. She gave the girl a weak sad smile, then turned to leave.

The girl looked up quickly. &quot;W wait... What is your name? I mean... I&#39;m 
Sarah... Sarah Richards.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Kris,&quot; Kris said over her shoulder as she pushed through a set of 
doors and quickly descended a set of winding stairs out of the school 
not wanting that girl to follow her. Kris stepped out of the school to 
be greeted by a breath of future autumn breeze. The cool wind felt good 
on her skin and she breathed in the scent of flowers that bordered the 
path leading off the school grounds. She looked down at the flowers and 
smiled to herself. With a slight skip in her step she started down the 
path, darted across the street and into a small flower shop on the 
corner. 

The scent of flowers felt like a warm embrace. The rainbow of colours 
made Kris smile as she knelt to get a closer look at some of the Lilies. 

&quot;Can I help you?.&quot; A voice said from behind her. When Kris looked up she 
found herself being watched by woman in a long apron. 

&quot;I&#39;m looking for a flower for someone.&quot; Kris said turning back to the 
flowers.  

The woman stepped closer to Kris, &quot;What exactly are you looking for?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kris stood and stretched, wincing against the pain in 
her back and leg. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; The woman asked suddenly concerned. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kris lied, the truth was she would never be &#145;fine&#39;, 
however she learned to block the pain. Only on those occasions when she 
was stressed did it actually bother her. 

The woman eyed Kris closely, &quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kris said taking a deep breath and continued to look at the 
flowers. 

&quot;Is there something in particular you were looking for?&quot; The woman 
followed Kris&#39;s glance. 

&quot;She liked purple.&quot; Kris said softly, &quot;Mostly lilies.&quot; She looked at the 
tiger Lilies, then lifted her glasses to wipe at her eyes. She could 
feel her emotions boiling over again. 

&quot;Well we have just got an order of Stargazer Lilies. They are a very 
beautiful purple and are right over here.&quot; The woman gestured toward a 
set of three Lilies in a vase near a cash register, &quot;Would you like 
one?&quot;

Kris slowly moved across the room and gently touched one of the flowers, 
&quot;They are beautiful.&quot; She had never seen such a flower before in her 
life. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure your lady friend will like them too.&quot; The woman said 
confidently as she rushed around the counter, &quot;Is it her birthday?&quot; She 
asked curiously.

&quot;She would have loved them.&quot; Kris&#39;s expression grew long, &quot;I&#39;ll take 
one.&quot; Kris said with a weak smile. 

The woman quickly wrapped the flower without a word and handed it to 
Kris who dug in her pocket for some money. She gave the woman a twenty 
and awaited her change before quickly leaving the store and running down 
the road. She stopped and plopped down on one of the many wooden benches 
that lined the streets. She looked down at the neatly wrapped flower, 
struggling against the tears that threatened to overwhelm her.

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; A small voice called out. When Kris looked up there 
was a small girl, merely 10 or 11 year in age, looking up at her. Kris 
had to blink for a moment to make sure she wasn&#39;t dreaming. The girl 
looked so familiar that she had to rub her eyes to make sure she was not 
dreaming. The girl had a concerned look on her face, &quot;You look sad.&quot; She 
said as she sat down next to Kris

&quot;I am,&quot; Kris said smiling down at the child, &quot;but I&#39;ll be alright.&quot;

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; The girl asked her eyes wide with curiosity. 

&quot;Heather! What are you doing with that boy?&quot; A woman yelled as she ran 
down the road, &quot;What have I told you?&quot; She took the girl by the hand and 
forced her off the bench. 

&quot;But mom, she is hurt.&quot; The girl said not taking her eyes off of Kris as 
her mother pulled her away. 

&quot;She?&quot; The woman took another look at Kris and blushed in embarrassment, 
&quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry. My child gets easily confused.&quot; 

&quot;No, you are the one confused.&quot; Kris leaned back on the bench and stared 
up at the woman. She turned back to the girl and patted her on the head, 
&quot;Thanks for being concerned.&quot; She said softly, and returned her glare on 
the woman, &quot;You should listen to your child more often.&quot;

&quot;See I told you.&quot; The girl said to her mother proudly. 

&quot;Well, you still shouldn&#39;t be talking to strangers.&quot; She pulled the girl 
away while giving Kris a look of disgust. 

Kris smiled. For some reason the purity of a child always made Kris 
smile. It was like there was some level of hope in this world. That is 
if the child didn&#39;t become corrupted by their parents. The girl reminded 
her so much of her old friend of hers.
