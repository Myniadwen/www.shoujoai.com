<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>The Academy bells chimed signally the arrival of lunch hour and Misty 
could not have been happier. Every since Jessica left her room she has 
felt uneasy and a knot of worry had built up inside of her gut. She 
needed to get back to the dorm to make sure everything was all right. 
She had known Jessica for several years now and they had been sleeping 
together for the past six months. She knew that Jessica did not have the 
same feelings for her as she had for Jessica, but she did not really 
care. As long as Jessica needed her then she would be there for the 
girl, just like Jessica was there for everyone else in the dorm. She 
quickly closed her books and shoved them into her backpack before 
rushing for the classroom door in search of her lover. 

&quot;Hey Misty wait up!!&quot; One of her classmates called out as Misty reached 
the door. 

Misty stopped and turned around to see a short girl with shoulder length 
blonde hair running towards her, &quot;Sorry Emily, I was in a rush.&quot; She 
explained as the girl caught up and they both head down the hall. 

&quot;Your mind on Jessica again?&quot; Emily inquired with a sly grin; &quot;You had 
sex with her this morning, didn&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;It is none of your business.&quot; Misty replied. 

&quot;Why won&#39;t you tell me?&quot; Emily pouted, &quot;I want to know all the juicy 
details. Did she eat you out?&quot; 

Misty flushed lightly, &quot;You really are perverted Emily.&quot; She shook her 
head in disbelief of her friend, &quot;You&#39;re the only one I know who can ask 
something like that with a straight face.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m just the curious type.&quot; Emily explained sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;ve always 
wanted to know what making love to another girl would be like. I&#39;ve 
heard Jessica&#39;s touch can make a girl squeal out loud. Is that true?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Misty said dreamily, &quot;It&#39;s nothing compared to her lips...&quot; 
She said with a shiver.

&quot;So you two did do the nasty this morning.&quot; Emily exclaimed, triumphant 
that she was right, &quot;I knew that look on your face was more then just 
your usual good mood.&quot; 

Misty watched her friend curiously, &quot;Do you study me that often that you 
know when I&#39;ve made love?&quot; 

&quot;I try.&quot; Emily stated with a smile, &quot;You&#39;re my friend after all. It&#39;s my 
responsibility to make sure that Jessica doesn&#39;t hurt you.&quot; Her face 
grew long in a frown, &quot;She hasn&#39;t hurt you, has she?&quot; 

&quot;No, no.&quot; Misty replied, &quot;Far from it. She has been a prince.&quot; She let 
out a sigh of uncertainty. 

&quot;But?&quot; Emily probed. 

&quot;Did you notice her acting weird this morning?&quot; Misty inquired uneasily. 

&quot;You mean other then the fact that she has been swamped with all these 
new girls and is spending all her time around them?&quot; She inquired 
knowingly. 

Misty rubbed her forehead, &quot;Maybe it is just in my head. I just get this 
bad feeling.&quot; She explained as she pushed through the doors out of the 
school and onto the path to the Western Dorms 

&quot;Well, I would feel nervous if my lover was rooming with that Kris 
girl.&quot; Emily stated restlessly, &quot;She&#39;s something else. I hear she used 
to be an angel. How do you compete with that?&quot; 

Misty thought about the look upon Jessica&#39;s face when she met her in the 
hall that morning, as if she was embarrassed about something, &quot;You don&#39;t 
think that she could be interested in Kris, do you?&quot; She inquired 
nervously.

Emily shook her head, &quot;Even if she was I hear Kris is deeply involved 
with Jennifer North, the girl from East Wing who disappeared a while 
back.&quot; 

Misty let out a sigh of relief. 

Emily eyed her friend carefully; &quot;You do realize that Jessica doesn&#39;t 
love you right?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Misty took a deep breath and let it out, &quot;But I can&#39;t help 
loving her.&quot; She spotted Amy walking along an adjoining path towards the 
dorms, &quot;Afternoon, Nurse Amy.&quot; She waved to the nurse. 

&quot;Afternoon Amy.&quot; Emily greeted the girl as their paths intersected, 
&quot;What is with the crutch?&quot; She inquired eyeing the wooden support 
curiously. 

Amy patted the crutch, &quot;It is for Alyson.&quot; She stated, &quot;It has been a 
busy morning today I can tell you.&quot; 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Misty inquired interested in learning more about her 
new roommate. 

&quot;What hasn&#39;t happened?&quot; Amy replied with a tired sigh, &quot;I just hope that 
there are no more surprises today.&quot; She remarked as she stepped heavily 
up the stairs and opened the door for the girls, &quot;After you ladies.&quot; She 
offered.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Misty smiled. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Emily added as the two of them entered the dorm. The moment 
they were inside they could feel something was wrong, there were a few 
girls standing around a cluster of couches at the back of the lobby 
whispering to each other and as Misty approached she noticed Jessica 
laying motionless upon one of the couches and quickly ran to her side.

&quot;Jessie!!&quot; Misty tossed her book bag to the ground and dropped down next 
to her friend. 

&quot;Careful.&quot; Alyson warned pointing to the two redheads asleep at Misty&#39;s 
feet, &quot;You don&#39;t want to disturb them.&quot;

&quot;What the hell happened here?&quot; Emily glanced around at the group of 
sleeping girls, &quot;Is this a slumber party?&quot; 

Amy handed the crutch over the couch to Alyson, &quot;Here you go little 
lady. I do not want to catch you speeding with those you hear.&quot; She 
stated then scanned the group of girls, &quot;Do I want to know what happened 
to them?&quot;

&quot;They are Dream Walking.&quot; Alyson explained simply, &quot;Jenn was in trouble 
and Kim wanted to rescue her so they used Penny&#39;s dreams to get to 
Jenn&#39;s.&quot; 

Amy stared at Alyson, horror-struck by what she was hearing, &quot;You helped 
those two slingshot off someone&#39;s dreams?&quot; She exclaimed furiously at 
Alyson carelessness.

Alyson shrank into the couch at Amy&#39;s outburst, &quot;She demanded to be told 
how to get into the girl&#39;s dreams.&quot; Alyson explained distraughtly, &quot;I 
figured she knew what she was doing. She came from within a dream after 
all.&quot; 

Amy placed her head in her hands, &quot;I knew we should have spent more time 
on dream studies.&quot; She remarked dismally. 

Misty waved a hand in front of Jessica&#39;s face, &quot;What happened to her? Is 
there something wrong?&quot; 

Amy was about to explain when she spotted the group of girls listening 
in on them, &quot;Would you girls please stop gossiping and get your lunches. 
This has nothing to do with you.&quot; She ordered. The group did not wait 
around for Amy to repeat herself and rushed to the cafeteria. Amy then 
approached Misty and touched her shoulder, &quot;You should go too.&quot; She 
suggested softly.

Misty shoved the nurse&#39;s arm away and glared up at her, &quot;I&#39;m not leaving 
Jessie.&quot; She boldly stated, &quot;You can ground me to my room for a month if 
you like, but I want to be here when she wakes up.&quot; She glanced down at 
Jessica&#39;s sleeping form, &quot;She needs me.&quot; She explained in a tiny voice.

&quot;Alright.&quot; Amy patted Misty on the shoulder then turned to Emily, 
&quot;Emily? Could I ask you to go?&quot; 

Emily simply nodded, &quot;Misty, I&#39;ll catch you later alright?&quot; She gave the 
girl a quick hug, &quot;I&#39;m sure she is fine.&quot;

Misty gave a slight nod but did not take her eyes off Jessica&#39;s face, 
&quot;Later then.&quot;
