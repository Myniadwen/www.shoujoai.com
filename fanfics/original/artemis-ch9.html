<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 9 of 19)</h1>

<a href="../original/artemis-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>&quot;Hey!&quot; the tall blonde called with a laugh and a wave,
smiling happily as she ran a little to catch up to her
friend. Both women wore casual clothes, dressed for a
Saturday out, and in the sunlight they looked very
good.

&quot;It took you long enough, Nadine,&quot; the black haired
woman answered cheerfully, her short skirt hugging her
hips.

Nadine shrugged, her long blonde curls bouncing on her
bare shoulders. The dress she wore as a strapless
black number, with a white coat and purse. &quot;I slept in
Amy,&quot; she confessed sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry.&quot;

Amy had to smile slightly, unable to resist the girl&#39;s
puppydog eyes. &quot;You could sleep through the end of the
world,&quot; she joked as they walked down the street
together.

&quot;I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; Nadine protested.

&quot;Right,&quot; Amy smirked.

Nadine blushed, remembering certain sleeping in
incidents in the past. &quot;So what are we doing today?&quot;
she asked brightly.

Amy snickered at the obvious attempt to change the
subject. Still, she let it go as they walked on, &quot;I
thought we should go clubbing.&quot;

Nadine made a face, &quot;But we&#39;ve gone to most of the
good clubs in this city.&quot; She sighed, &quot;Not that
there&#39;s many in this town to start with.&quot;

They walked on a moment, Amy hesitating slightly. &quot;I
heard about a new place that we could try,&quot; she
finally said.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Nadine looked over at her curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s a wild place, from what I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Amy
cautioned.

&quot;We&#39;ve been to wild places before,&quot; Nadine reminded
her, &quot;hell, I can think of a few we went to more than
once!&quot;

&quot;The Daughters sounds like it&#39;s on a whole different
level,&quot; Amy shook her head. She tilted her head, &quot;If
even the rumors are true it&#39;s a dangerous sort of
place.&quot;

Nadine chuckled softly, looking over at Amy
thoughtfully. &quot;Something about this place has you
spooked,&quot; she said tauntingly.

&quot;I am not,&quot; Amy said with a great deal of dignity,
&quot;spooked.&quot;

Nadine reached out to take Amy&#39;s hand, grinning
impishly. &quot;Then let&#39;s check this place out, huh?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;You&#39;re relentless,&quot; Amy smiled back, &quot;but yeah, let&#39;s
go.&quot;

Together they walked to Amy&#39;s car and got in, smoothly
pulling out into traffic. With the top down the wind
gently ruffled their hair, the sun shining down on
them as they drove on. It didn&#39;t take long for them to
reach the bad side of town, then eventually pulling up
to a unmarked building.

&quot;There&#39;s a club here?&quot; Nadine blinked in surprise as
they got out.

Amy shut her car door with a thump, &quot;Yeah, they don&#39;t
advertise.&quot; She lead the way up the sidewalk towards
the door, the two heading in without knocking.

Going inside there were a few people who gave them
curious glances, but both girls ignored that. As they
walked forward into the bar itself they saw the back
wall, a massive mural painted up on it. The woman
stood in the forest, drawing a bow back smoothly, her
slim athletic body scarred and battered by many
battles. Still she was beautiful too, a warrior facing
her enemies with strength and courage. Just below the
image a simple line of text read, &#39;The Daughters of
Artemis.&#39;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Nadine murmured.

&quot;Quite a painting,&quot; Amy answered softly, &quot;I heard it
was done by one of the patrons.&quot;

Weaving through the tables they felt the eyes of men
and women falling on them, the assessing looks that
newcomers always received. Nadine smiled back at a few
of the handsome men, even as she felt a thrill at the
frankly sexual gazes a few women gave her and Amy.

&quot;Is this a gay bar?&quot; Nadine asked softy.

&quot;It&#39;s a mix,&quot; Amy answered with a shrug, &quot;gay,
straight, bi, and any other variation you can think
of, I&#39;ve heard.&quot; She smiled at Nadine&#39;s look, &quot;Not
normally my scene, but a friend invited me here and we
had a good time.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to the Daughters,&quot; the woman with the long
brow hair smiled slightly, studying the two of them as
they reached the bar itself. &quot;My name is Diana,&quot; she
said to them smoothly then asked, &quot;what can I get
you?&quot;

&quot;Rum and coke,&quot; Nadine smiled engagingly.

&quot;Beer,&quot; Amy shrugged.

Diana poured and mixed smoothly then passed over the
glasses with a wry look. &quot;I hope you have a good time
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Thanks, we will,&quot; Nadine smirked, giving another
speculative look around the bar.

Amy rolled her eyes then whispered once Diana had
moved off a little, &quot;You&#39;re acting like we&#39;re at a
meat market!&quot;

Nadine blushed a bit, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Be a bit more subtle, please,&quot; Amy said as they
walked over to a side table. She sat down gracefully,
&quot;Not that you&#39;ve ever been....&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Nadine said as she sat down with her
own drink. She gave Nadine a thoughtful look, &quot;How the
heck did you hear about this place?&quot;

Amy sipped at her drink, seemingly stalling a bit for
time. &quot;Girlfriend&#39;s birthday party,&quot; she finally
explained, &quot;a group of friends chipped in to take her
out and we ended up here.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Nadine looked thoughtful.

&quot;Are you ladies here alone?&quot; the soft voice asked.
Both looked up to see the older man looking down, his
face handsome if a bit rugged. The clothes were
elegant, if a bit old fashioned, and his eyes shone
with amused interest.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Nadine murmured, eyes wide.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Amy said firmly as she took Nadine&#39;s hand
in hers, &quot;but we&#39;re here together, sir.&quot;

He smiled, black hair almost gleaming in the light as
he said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that.&quot; Turning to go he
added, &quot;If you change your mind, I&#39;ll be here most of
the night.&quot;

&quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Nadine squeaked out once he
moved off.

&quot;He&#39;s a predator,&quot; Amy warned softly, &quot;didn&#39;t you feel
it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Nadine bit out, finishing off her drink. &quot;I&#39;ll
catch you later,&quot; she got up and went after the man,
stopping him as she spoke to him softly.

Amy felt her heart sink as they talked, the man
weaving a web of charm over her friend. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot;
the woman&#39;s voice was gentle, &quot;he doesn&#39;t eat
newcomers.&quot; Amy turned to see the tall redheaded woman
who has silently slipped up behind her, the woman
adding impishly, &quot;Well, at least not on the first
date.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Amy replied wryly.

:&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she chuckled. The gorgeous redhead
took the chair without asking as she continued, &quot;My
name is Dominique, little one.&quot;

Amy raised her eyebrows slightly and Dominique
smirked. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m that young,&quot; she decided
to say, studying the odd woman.

Dominique wore all black leather, and not the nice
sort of leather that a city girl might wear going out
clubbing. No, this was a darker looking costume, a
plunging neckline, high skirt and so tight it looked
like it had been painted on. Thigh high boots hugged
each long leg, matching gloves on each arm and a
expression that was entirely comfortable.

&quot;Young enough,&quot; Dominique purred. She smiled in
amusement at her look, &quot;What do you think of my
outfit, then?&quot;

&quot;Daring,&quot; Amy conceded, a blush coloring her cheeks.
Dominique crossed her legs and her blush darkened as
she realized the woman wasn&#39;t wearing panties.

&quot;You look like you&#39;ve been abandoned for now,&quot;
Dominique and Amy&#39;s gazes were drawn to the dancers
where Nadine and her companion were necking furiously.

Amy looked away, her jaw tensing. &quot;I guess so,&quot; she
sighed.

&quot;Then would you care to join me?&quot; Dominique asked
softly, resting her unusually pale hand on Amy&#39;s. She
smiled, showing what almost looked like fangs as she
continued, &quot;But I should warn you, I do bite on the
first date.&quot;

Amy met those seemingly bottomless eyes, almost
feeling her will slip away as she breathed out her
surrender, &quot;Yes.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: Dominique is a vampire featured in the series
Descent, as well as appearing here in Daughters. This
episode is intended to show that Daughters, while a
interesting place, is not the safest place for a
unaware newcomer....</pre>
