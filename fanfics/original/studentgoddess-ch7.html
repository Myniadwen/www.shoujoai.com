<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 7 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>      Finally, she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. The demon quietly exited the room, deciding to 
leave Krystal to her reading. She started to sulk down the hall, not really wanting to run 
into anyone at the moment. However, as she retreated to the back patio, Isaka found that she 
was far from alone.

      &quot;No, not there Posh-Posh, don&#39;t-aiee!&quot;

      Isaka could now recognize that scream from anywhere, but what the hell was a 
Posh-Posh? As if answering her thought, Erin noticed her. The tiny snake with the bell was 
curled up underneath her shirt. Poor Erin was trying to get rid of it, so Isaka came to her 
rescue and pulled the snake out by its tail.

      &quot;Th-thanks Isaka,&quot; the young woman said before sitting down next to her on the patio. 
The little snake jumped into Erin&#39;s hands, regardless of her flinching.

      &quot;Posh-Posh?&quot; The demon said, quirking a brow.

      &quot;Ah, I think that&#39;s his name... he seems to like it...&quot; Erin watched as the snake 
nodded, its bell jingling. &quot;I-I think something strange is happening to me. I was going to 
tell you and Krystal this morning, but, uh...&quot; Her face flushed bright red.

      &quot;You walked in on us... don&#39;t worry, so did everyone else.&quot; The thought made Isaka 
sad. Was that how Krystal felt during those moments? Did she feel uncomfortable because 
Isaka was egging her on to have sex with her? Granted, they had yet to go all the way, 
but...

      &quot;...did something happen?&quot; Isaka broke out of her reverie due to Erin&#39;s question. 
&quot;...yeah... I think I may have screwed up or... or... I dunno.&quot; The look on the other girl&#39;s 
face told Isaka that she was going to have to elaborate.

      &quot;Krystal thinks I just want her for the sex.&quot; Her blunt wording added a nice shade of 
pink to Erin&#39;s complexion. &quot;Ah... okay. That&#39;s not good... you love her right?&quot;

      Isaka just nodded dumbly. &quot;Hmm... I&#39;m not sure what to say. I mean, did she say it to 
you straight out?&quot; Great, just what the demon needed. Lesbian love advice from the vessel of 
the snake goddess.

      &quot;Yeah... she said she doesn&#39;t like it and said something about how she likes my 
vulnerable side better...&quot; For some odd reason, the demon wanted to tell the whole story. 
Maybe she was just so depressed that she needed someone to listen... &quot;You see, she used to 
date Seth. Then Seth thought she was in love with me and dumped her. That was when I swooped 
in... but... I&#39;m afraid... that she might not... love me because of the way I&#39;ve been 
acting.&quot;

      Erin was silent for a second. She was no love counselor, but... &quot;Well, seeing as 
you&#39;re in a lesbian relationship, the norms for a hetero relationship don&#39;t fit in. Because 
of the lack of definition of roles, you&#39;re encountering a problem.&quot; Isaka just gave her an 
&#39;oh-really?&#39; look, but Erin kept going.

      &quot;You&#39;re afraid that if you aren&#39;t masculine enough, Krystal will turn away to men and 
leave you behind. At the same time, you feel as though if you don&#39;t take this step in your 
relationship, it won&#39;t be consummated or if you don&#39;t do it, you can&#39;t show how much total 
affection you have for her.&quot;

      Erin took a pause before continuing. &quot;Krystal, on the other hand, has already accepted 
that no real stereotypical roles should exist in your relationship. She&#39;s getting upset 
because you&#39;re trying so hard when all she really wants is to see your vulnerable side and 
take care of you. Plus, she thinks you&#39;re only after her because of the thought of having 
her. She&#39;s afraid that once you have... you know...&quot; Erin blushed, not wanting come right 
out and say sex.

      &quot;She&#39;s afraid that you&#39;ll leave her, but at the same time, she&#39;s afraid of stringing 
you on because of that one thing. It&#39;s because she loves you that she&#39;s afraid of getting 
hurt or not being enough for you. I&#39;m sure she just wants to hold and nurture you just as 
much as you wish to show her how devoted you are.&quot; Erin suddenly laughed. &quot;I find it funny 
that you try to be so dominant... I mean, Krystal is so maternal and you seem so needy. Your 
relationship will probably much better off should you let her take care of you...&quot;

      A bit of silence passed, with Isaka quite sure her jaw was unhinged. How... how did 
Erin know all that off the top of her head? Was the snake goddess also a love guru? Did Seth 
forget to mention that...?

      Erin sheepishly rubbed the back of her head. &quot;...but that&#39;s just my view on you 
guys... it&#39;s probably totally wrong!&quot;

      Isaka wondered if she&#39;d just wandered into the twilight zone. Erin may have just 
solved her problem...

      &quot;I&#39;m going to go see if Posh-Posh knows how to swim, so, um... good luck with 
Krystal!&quot; It was only after Erin left that Isaka said, &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Troubles in lesbian paradise?&quot; Krystal didn&#39;t exactly agree with Abby&#39;s wording, but 
it sounded right.

      &quot;Yeah... I just... I dunno. I thought that two girls weren&#39;t so... you know...&quot; Abby 
sighed and rolled her eyes. &quot;If you don&#39;t come right out and say it, I&#39;m not going to be 
able to help you, Krystal.&quot;

  The blonde girl nervously nibbled on her thumbnail. &quot;I&#39;m afraid Isaka just wants me for 
the sex.&quot;

      The young mother suddenly stood up from the table they&#39;d been sitting at. &quot;Okay, I am 
not ready for this. As much as I would like to have practice for when me and Eveon have this 
talk next month, I just can&#39;t do it.&quot;

      Krystal watched as her only hope for support walked off. She resisted the urge to bang 
her head into the table. She&#39;d already gone and made Isaka upset and now even Abby couldn&#39;t 
help her...

      &quot;Krystal?&quot;

      Said young woman looked up to see Tycara holding a glass of water. &quot;Abby just told me 
that you needed somebody to talk to... she said something about how you&#39;re situation is 
about people, not action.&quot;

      Krystal smiled to herself. So maybe Abby didn&#39;t want to get involved because she 
didn&#39;t know Isaka that well... how kind of her to send Tycara in her stead! The white haired 
woman sat down next to her. &quot;You seem down... is Isaka treating you good?&quot;

      Krystal nodded dully. &quot;Yeah... I just feel like she doesn&#39;t love me-&quot;

      &quot;Oh no! She loves you, most definitely!&quot;

      Krystal smiled at the encouragement, but it did little to help ease her worries. &quot;I 
mean, I think she&#39;s just in it for...&quot; She wasn&#39;t quite sure how na&Atilde;&macr;ve Tycara was, but, &quot;I&#39;m 
afraid she just wants to have... or, um, do it with me.&quot;

      Tycara tilted her head in curiosity. &quot;Do what...?&quot;

      &quot;Um, that thing that Isaka keeps threatening to turn Seth into a girl for if he does 
it with you before you&#39;re married.&quot;

      &quot;Oh... oh!!! That thing! Alright I get it!&quot; There was a bit of silence between them 
before Tycara started giggling. &quot;Isaka isn&#39;t in it for that. She told you about her first 
love, didn&#39;t she?&quot; Krystal could vaguely remember that conversation, lying on Isaka&#39;s bed.

      &quot;When Isaka was a human girl, she was taken in by another girl who cared for her like 
an older sister. Over time, Isaka fell in love and wanted nothing more than to be loved by 
her...&quot; Tycara sighed and ran a hand through her hair. &quot;Unfortunately, as you know, it was 
highly frowned up in that time.&quot;

      Krystal nodded solemnly as Tycara continued on. &quot;I&#39;m not sure how much she told you, 
but she was beaten severely and disowned by her sister... it was after living a few months 
without love or shelter or purpose that Isaka succumbed to darkness.&quot;

      The blonde woman did not exactly remember that part of the story... &quot;A normal person 
would have become a blood thirsty beast, but she never forgot what it felt like to be in 
love. I haven&#39;t known Isaka all her life, but I know she spent so much of her time secretly 
trying to find a person just like her sister... except that person would love her back and 
be everything she needed.&quot;

      Tycara took a sip of her water and gave Krystal a knowing look. &quot;You see, even though 
Isaka tries to be all tough, she&#39;s really fragile on the inside. She&#39;s just like a little 
child who wants to be held and cared for... I don&#39;t want you to think you&#39;re some kind of 
replacement for her because of what happened with her sister, but... to her, you are like 
the light who is kind enough to shine for a shadow.&quot;

      Krystal still felt unsure about the whole thing. &quot;But... how do you know all this...?&quot;

      &quot;Me and Isaka are a lot alike. I&#39;m really lucky that she took such great care of me. I 
was a ravaging bloodthirsty monster when she found me...&quot; Tycara flushed bright red. 
&quot;Actually, she beat me to a pulp and then started to take care of me. While she did, she 
always talked about her older sister and things her sister used to do for her...&quot;

      Tycara smiled secretively. &quot;Now, Isaka only talks about you and all the nice things 
you do. Isaka is afraid that she&#39;s not loving you enough... after years of seducing other 
girls, she feels like she needs to have your body and not just your mind. She&#39;s just 
scared...&quot;

      Krystal couldn&#39;t quite imagine Isaka being scared... but... She&#39;d never stopped to 
wonder what Isaka needed. &quot;You&#39;re quite literally the light of her life. Without light, a 
shadow cannot exist.&quot;

      With that, Tycara finished her glass of water and stood up. &quot;...but, that&#39;s just my 
two cents. I mean, I&#39;m straight, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;ll affect my advice. Plus, Isaka 
changes moods every hour...&quot;

      As Tycara walked off to go find Seth, Krystal was in awe of how perceptive the 
supposedly na&Atilde;&macr;ve angel-demon hybrid was. &quot;Thank you so much...!&quot; She whispered before 
standing up. 

***** 

      Isaka was trying her best not to pace. Here she was, in the living room, trying to 
come up with a good plan to make up with Krystal. She couldn&#39;t go right up to her and say, 
&#39;Please let me be the submissive one from now on! All I want is your maternal affection!&#39; 
That would just not do, no matter how much Isaka wanted to be held and consoled by Krystal.

      The demon was starting to wonder if she was losing sight of why she loved Krystal. 
They were polar opposites and yet... Oh, who was she kidding? Erin was completely right; she 
was just a sick little kitty trying to be a big bad lion. And that was getting her no 
where... Isaka had a firm decision in her mind to be more true to Krystal and show her that 
what she really loved was how kind she was.

      Little did the demon know that Krystal was going through the same process in the 
kitchen. The exorcist nervously bit on her thumbnail. This whole time she thought it was 
just about sex, but all Isaka truly wanted was someone to give her attention and care for 
her... and Isaka just thought that the sex was necessary to show Krystal how much she loved 
her. The blonde haired woman stood up from the table. Tycara was right; Isaka needed her 
more than anything and Krystal needed her just as much.

      Krystal hadn&#39;t noticed how clingy Isaka was, nor had she considered how horrible her 
early years must have been. Her lover had been so deprived from love that it made sense for 
her to be so uneasy. Krystal was now sure of what she was going to do; she was going to 
provide Isaka with all the tender love she needed. The demon didn&#39;t necessarily want sex; 
all she wanted was for Krystal to love her!

      The two lovers wrapped up their final thoughts and proceeded to find one another. Of 
course, the kitchen and the living room were scarcely separated by a hallway, making their 
confrontation all the more easier.

      Isaka spotted Krystal first, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, this is all my fault... I lost sight of what 
our relationship was really about-&quot;

      &quot;No, it&#39;s not you,&quot; Krystal said, interrupting her, &quot;I completely disregarded how much 
you needed me...&quot;

      &quot;No... no, it just took me a little while to realize the real reason I love you and I 
shouldn&#39;t keep pushing such silly physical needs on you. I thought that it was the only to 
show how much I care-&quot;

      &quot;-but, Isaka... I didn&#39;t realize until now how vulnerable you are and how much my love 
means to you, just as much as how your love keeps me going too...&quot;

      &quot;-all I need is to be with you, because I love your presence-&quot;

      &quot;-you&#39;re my other half, so I want nothing more than to hold you-&quot;

      There was a bit of silence between them before the two lovers smiled.

      &quot;A world without you is a dismal place,&quot; Isaka murmured.

      &quot;And a world without you has no purpose,&quot; Krystal said, taking the first step forward.

      With that, the demon launched herself into the exorcist&#39;s arms, nuzzling into her 
shoulder. Krystal buried her face in Isaka&#39;s long brown hair and they stood their, 
whispering to each other.

      &quot;God, I don&#39;t care if I am the submissive ninny, just don&#39;t ever leave me...&quot; Isaka 
whispered before pulling back.

      &quot;I won&#39; t... so long as you let me hold you,&quot; Krystal murmured, making her demon 
smile. &quot;Like I would allow you to let go...&quot;

      The two lovers then engaged in a kiss more passionate than any one they had thus far. 
It was innocent and sweet, but at the same time so meaningful. As they pulled away, Isaka 
laid her head on Krystal&#39;s shoulder. &quot;No wonder Eveon likes to be so submissive to Mina...&quot;

      Krystal giggled and lovingly rubbed her back. &quot;And no wonder Mina likes to be so 
dominant to Eveon...&quot;

      They heard a slight cough and turned to see that the aforementioned couple had 
returned from their walk from the bus stop. &quot;You know I&#39;m standing right here,&quot; Eveon 
muttered.

      &quot;Ah, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;ll make it up to you later,&quot; Mina said, lovingly caressing Eveon&#39;s 
hand.

      Krystal and Isaka just smiled at the two girls. Of course, this touching little scene 
couldn&#39;t be without some voyeurs.

      &quot;...and troubles in lesbian paradise are solved...&quot; Abby muttered. Erin was smiling to 
herself, trying to stop Posh-Posh from going down the stairs. The two women were currently 
peeking down at the scene below from the railings. &quot;I&#39;m happy for them... even if it isn&#39;t 
normal... but I have to say hi to Eveon and Mina now!&quot;

      Near the kitchen, Tycara was also watching with a smile on her face. However, Seth was 
turned the other way. &quot;Why aren&#39;t you looking? Doesn&#39;t it make you happy?&quot; Her boyfriend 
just looked quite uncomfortable. &quot;Imagine you&#39;re in a house with a bunch of guys, most of 
them gay. Wouldn&#39;t you feel a little intrusive for looking?&quot;
