<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 12 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>It turned out that hugging was only the beginning of what the &#39;Kris fan 
club&#39; had in store for her. The next week was utter hell for Kris. She 
had to endure groups of girls in the hall who&#39;d giggle and disappear 
around the corner, love letters stuck to her locker, which she tossed in 
the garbage not really reading it entirely. Things were bad enough with 
her emotions being the way they were, but this was getting out of hand. 
She entered the cafeteria deep in thought. Trying hard to figure out how 
she would get these girls off her back. She was so deep in thought that 
she didn&#39;t even notice Tanya waving at her from a table in the corner of 
the cafeteria. Tanya ran up behind her friend and wrapped her arms 
around the girl&#39;s shoulders causing Kris to spin around and swing a fist 
at her. Tanya dodged out of the way. 

&quot;Woah there Kris, it is just me.&quot; Tanya said, astonished by her friend&#39;s 
speed. She forgot how jumpy Kris could be at times. 

&quot;Oh, Tanya I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Kris apologized rubbing her forehead, &quot;I didn&#39;t 
realize...&quot; She ran a hand through her hair in embarrassment.

&quot;That is alright.&quot; Tanya chuckled, &quot;Remember when I tried to sneak up on 
you and you flipped me over your shoulder.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m still sorry about that.&quot; Kris answered shyly. She really thought 
she had hurt her friend badly back then. She hated being so jumpy all 
the time. 

&quot;No problem.&quot; Tanya reassured her friend with a pat on the shoulder, 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you come sit with me for lunch?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Kris responded with a smile, &quot;Just let me get something first, 
okay.&quot; 

&quot;Good luck.&quot; Tanya nodded her head towards the line up for food, &quot;You&#39;ll 
be lucky if you can get anything at all before the bell rings.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll see.&quot; Kris slyly grinned. She examined the line up. She was not 
sure what she was trying to find when she heard someone near the front 
call out to her. 

&quot;Hey Kris!&quot; Sarah yelled, &quot;You looking for something?&quot; 

Kris walked over to the girl, &quot;Yeah, but it seems like I won&#39;t be eating 
today. This line is insane.&quot; She concluded waving her arms at it.

Sarah looked around, &quot;What do you want?&quot; She asked with a smile as she 
reached the pile of plastic food trays and set one down on the track in 
front of a long buffet.

&quot;Hey no butting in!&quot; A boy growled angrily from behind Sarah. 

&quot;She is not butting in.&quot; Sarah returned, &quot;I&#39;m offering to buy her 
lunch.&quot; 

&quot;No really that is alright.&quot; Kris protested. 

&quot;Stop trying to be charming and just tell me what you want.&quot; Sarah said 
bluntly, &quot;It is not like this is a date or anything.&quot; 

&quot;If you insist.&quot; Kris smiled at the girl, &quot;I&#39;ll just have a cheese 
burger and maybe a butterscotch pudding if you don&#39;t mind.&quot; 

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; Sarah opened one of the glass cabinets and pulled out a 
foil wrapped burger, &quot;See that wasn&#39;t so hard now was it.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Thanks, you&#39;re a life saver.&quot; Kris said, making sure she kept close to 
the girl, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I keep treating you so badly.&quot; She softly spoke.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; Sarah reached the cash register and payed for 
the meal, &quot;I know you have gone through a lot.&quot;

&quot;That is the understatement of the year.&quot; Kris took the tray from Sarah, 
&quot;Let me help you with that.&quot; She started through the crowd, &quot;My friend 
is holding a seat for me and I bet we can find another.&quot; 

&quot;Friend?&quot; Sarah asked curiously, &quot;Do you mean that red headed girl from 
the other morning?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kris let out a sigh, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Tanya can be a bit much at 
times, she is just a little overprotective at times. She is harmless.&quot; 
Kris rethought that, &quot;Maybe not harmless, but you are safe with me 
around.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know who to be more worried about.&quot; Sarah laughed, &quot;You or 
her?&quot;

Kris turned to face the girl, &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; She wondered 
confused by this statement.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; Sarah answered quickly, trying to hide her grin. 

&quot;I&#39;m starting to think you are the dangerous one.&quot; Kris responded 
turning around in search of Tanya again. Her eyes fell on the redhead 
waving at her, &quot;There she is.&quot; Kris dodged around a couple of kids &#39;till 
she found herself at Tanya&#39;s table, &quot;You think we can find another 
chair?&quot; Kris asked looking around.

&quot;Already taken care of.&quot; Tanya grinned patting two chairs that she had 
held for the two of them.

&quot;How did you know?&quot; Kris startled, sitting down next to Tanya giving 
Sarah the seat next to herself. 

Tanya leaned over close to Kris&#39;s ear, &quot;I knew what you were planning, 
you sly girl.&quot; 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t planning anything!&quot; Kris protested, &quot;Sarah was nice enough to 
get my lunch for me.&quot; 

Tanya stretched over the table to get a look at Sarah, &quot;Is that so?&quot; 

&quot;Tanya, leave her alone.&quot; Kris rebuked, handing a burger to Sarah, &quot;She 
is off limits do you understand?&quot;

&quot;Ahhh... You are no fun Kris,&quot; Tanya leaned back in her chair, &quot;Can&#39;t I 
tease her just a little.&quot; She
sighed disappointed.

&quot;Be a good girl Tanya.&quot; Kris ordered in the best commanding voice she 
could muster. 

&quot;You two are silly.&quot; Sarah giggled as she unwrapped her burger.  

&quot;Please don&#39;t encourage her, Sarah.&quot; Kris reproved, giving Sarah a 
glare. 

&quot;So, Sarah is it?&quot; Tanya smirked with a broad grin, &quot;What brings a nice 
girl like you to this end of the world?&quot; She pulled out a Cadbury Cream 
Egg from her book bag and started to peel the foil off. 

&quot;What makes you think I&#39;m a nice girl?&quot; Sarah queried taking a bite of 
her burger.

Tanya bit the top of the chocolate egg off and looked over at Sarah with 
a sly grin, &quot;Is that so? Do tell?&quot;

&quot;Tanya!&quot; Kris snarled.

&quot;She started it!&quot; Tanya protested. She stuck her tongue in the hole she 
created in the egg and licked out the cream filling. She stopped and 
starred at the egg, &quot;You know I think I enjoy eating these things this 
way far too much.&quot;

Kris choked on a piece of hamburger. She coughed and tried to catch her 
breath. 

&quot;Here, drink this.&quot; Tanya handed Kris a can of pop. 

Kris grabbed the drink and drained half of it. When she was able to 
breathe again she set the can down and took a deep breath, &quot;That was 
bad.&quot; Kris told them between pants. 

&quot;I thought it was funny.&quot; Sarah stated trying to keep herself from 
bursting into laughter. 

&quot;I tell you, sometimes I really think Tanya is trying to give me a heart 
attack.&quot; Kris uttered placing her hand on her head feeling dizzy. 

&quot;I was just telling the truth.&quot; Tanya told her bluntly. 

&quot;Since when?&quot; Kris realized after the words left her mouth that she 
didn&#39;t want to know, &quot;Wait don&#39;t answer that!&quot; 

Tanya leaned over to Kris, &quot;You can&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t enjoy it too.&quot; 

&quot;Tanya quit it!&quot; Kris shook her head, &quot;Since when have you become so 
blunt?&quot; She wondered rubbing her temple. 

&quot;A lot has happened while you were gone.&quot; Tanya said then fell silent.

&quot;How long have you two known each other?&quot; Sarah inquired. 

&quot;I think we met back in Grade Two.&quot; Tanya recalled thinking back to the 
past, &quot;She was such a cutie back then. The girls were always over her..&quot; 
She remembered with a smile. 

&quot;Lies.&quot; Kris protested, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&quot;

&quot;You always chased girls?&quot; Sarah asked septically.

&quot;It is not like that.&quot; Kris justified herself, &quot;Tanya is making it up. 
They chased me around.&quot;

Tanya looked Kris in the eyes, &quot;Remember the twins Natalie and Nicole?&quot; 
She recollected with a grin. 

Kris swallowed a piece of her hamburger hard, &quot;They... they don&#39;t 
count...&quot; She was getting nervous. The thing was she was having trouble 
remembering a lot of the past since the day she woke up in the hospital. 
She didn&#39;t even remember who she was for a while and had to piece her 
memories back together of the last year, however there were still a lot 
of holes here and there. 

&quot;Twins?&quot; Sarah snickered. 

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her.&quot; Kris tired to defend herself, &quot;They were just a 
couple of girls from school. Nothing more.&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh..&quot; Tanya slyly smile, &quot;That is what you would like people to 
believe.&quot; 

&quot;We were only seven.&quot; Kris proclaimed, &quot;It was only a innocent kiss.&quot;

&quot;From both of them.&quot; Tanya smirked, &quot;Keep telling yourself that and you 
might start believing it.&quot; 

&quot;Ummm...&quot; Sarah was beet red, &quot;Were you two always... interested in 
girls?&quot; 

&quot;As long as I can remember.&quot; Tanya stated bluntly. Kris nodded in 
agreement. 

&quot;Oh,&quot; She stared down at the last bit of her lunch. 

&quot;Does that bother you?&quot; Kris asked concerned that she may have just lost 
a friend.  

&quot;No no.&quot; Sarah nervously finished her burger and tossed the foil in a 
nearby garbage pail, &quot;Listen, I need to get going,&quot; She stood up and 
smiled at Kris, &quot;Thanks for letting me join you.&quot;

&quot;Anytime.&quot; Kris thanked, sadly looking up at the girl. 

&quot;And Tanya,&quot; She looked over at the other girl, &quot;Thanks for a memorable 
day. It was nice to finally get to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;Uhhh...&quot; Tanya seemed rather stunned by the thanks, &quot;Oh before you go. 
I was about to ask Kris if she wanted to go to a youth group I found not 
long ago. They gather at a place called the &#39;Coffee House&#39; on Thursday 
nights. What do you think?&quot; She asked enthusiastically, &quot;Would you two 
want to go?&quot; 

&quot;Youth group?&quot; Kris gave her friend a uneasy look, &#39;What are you up too 
Tanya?&#39; She thought to herself.

&quot;What does the group do?&quot; Sarah asked curiously. 

&quot;They just play pool and watch movies from time to time.&quot; Tanya informed 
nonchalantly, &quot; Just a bunch of kids hanging out is all.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll have to ask my parents,&quot; Sarah sounded interested, &quot;but I&#39;ll see 
if I can make it. What time?&quot; 

&quot;Thursday at 6:30pm.&quot; Tanya said with a grin, &quot;How about we meet up at 
the Burger King down town around six? We can eat and head over to the 
club afterwards.&quot;

&quot;Deal!&quot; Sarah piped aroused by the idea of going to a club, &quot;I&#39;ll see 
you tomorrow then, kay?&quot; Sarah asked as she started out of the 
cafeteria. 

&quot;See you there!&quot; Tanya waved at the girl as she pushed through a set of 
doors. 

&quot;Ta-n-ya...&quot; Kris glared at her friend, &quot;What have you done?&quot;

&quot;What???&quot; Tanya uttered under her breath, trying to act perplexed by her 
friends question. 

&quot;What exactly is this &#39;Coffee House&#39;?&quot; Kris tried hard to hide her anger 
at the fact that her friend had not only set her up on a date with a 
girl she just met, but arranged it to be at a pool hall of sorts. 

&quot;You have nothing to worry about, Kris.&quot; Tanya relaxed in her chair, 
folding her arms behind her head, &quot;It is just a group for 16 - 22 year 
old gay kids.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT!?!&quot; Kris screamed causing kids from all around their table to look 
up at them. Kris didn&#39;t seem to care as she grabbed Tanya by the shirt, 
&quot;What do you think you were doing?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just testing her.&quot; Tanya explained, trying to calm her friend down, 
&quot;She seems to be alright with everything, however do you want to know 
how open minded she is or not?&quot; 

&quot;What if you give the girl a bloody heart attack?&quot; Kris started to 
panic, &quot;I just wanted to have a normal high school life. Don&#39;t you 
understand? Normal!?!&quot; She shook her friend. 

&quot;Will you calm down.&quot; Tanya was getting worried about all the stares 
they were getting, then she noticed a teacher heading their way, &quot;Craps 
you have attracted a teacher. Will you calm down?&quot; She removed Kris&#39;s 
hands from her shirt, &quot;You panic to much you know that?&quot;

Kris sat back down into her seat and put her hands on her head, &quot;A gay 
club. I can&#39;t believe this.&quot; She shook her head in dismay at her friends 
actions, &quot;I&#39;ve never been to a gay club before myself.&quot; She mumbled to 
herself.

&quot;Well here is your chance.&quot; Tanya put up with a broad grin, &quot;They are 
just a bunch of harmless kids.&quot; 

Kris gave Tanya a glare, &quot;If you are part of this group I find it hard 
to believe that they are anything, but harmless.&quot;

&quot;Is everything alright over here?&quot; A teacher asked as she arrived next 
to the two girls. 

&quot;Everything is fine.&quot; Tanya informed leaning over the back of her chair 
to look at the teacher
upside down, &quot;My friend just got some shocking news is all.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah everything is just bloody well peachy.&quot; Kris cursed as she got out 
of her seat. 

&quot;Watch your mouth young man.&quot; The teacher ordered. 

Kris spun around and glared at the teacher with anger in her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m 
not a boy so leave me the hell alone!&quot; Kris said baring her teeth, then 
turned and stormed out of the cafeteria, &#39;What the hell was Tanya 
thinking inviting Sarah to a gay club? What is that girl up to this 
time?&#39; Kris thought as she walked down the halls. &quot;She is such a pain at 
times.&quot; She mumbled aloud.
