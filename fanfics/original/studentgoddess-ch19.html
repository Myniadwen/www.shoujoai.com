<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>      &quot;We were together for a few decades, but it felt like... well, it felt very short. 
Once a vessel becomes one with a god, aging stops once you reach your peak age... for us, it 
was when we were twenty,&quot; Faye sighed, relishing the memories. &quot;You and I were still in our 
vessels and we were so happy.&quot;

      Erin bit her lip nervously. &quot;...what happened? I mean, something happened if I&#39;m here 
now, right?&quot; Faye&#39;s expression turned to one of sadness. &quot;The gods... we all serve humans, 
but... if humans no longer want us, then we are doomed...&quot; 

***** 

      There had been a lot of talk in meetings and between gods about new religions 
attacking their own. People were starting to turn away from the gods and go for other 
religions. Some were worried about it, but most of them were confident that once people 
turned away, they would miss the protection of their gods.

      Faye wasn&#39;t worried in the least. She still received prayers and humans couldn&#39;t just 
get rid of them... and she was more focused on Erin. Actually, it was Erin who was beginning 
to worry. &quot;Their scripture says idolatry is sin,&quot; Erin said, eating some of the food laid 
out before her. They were currently at her temple, enjoying brunch.

      &quot;Idolatry? Is that how we are labeled? Suppose they do have an almighty god... why 
would we be called sin? We are merely beings on this earth, so why would He label us as 
sin?&quot; Faye said, a little confused. &quot;It worries me because it is popular... also... for a 
man to be with another man is sin.&quot;

      &quot;What?! That&#39;s blasphemy...&quot; Some of the servants glanced their way after Faye&#39;s 
outburst. &quot;We support all kinds of relationship and love... love comes in all forms,&quot; Faye 
murmured, looking at Erim.

      &quot;I&#39;m worried, Faye... the scripture says sin leads to Hell and we are associated with 
the devil,&quot; Erin said, looking at her servants. The snake goddess was getting a bad feeling 
about this all. All the humans seemed a bit antsy... that wasn&#39;t good.

      &quot;Relax,&quot; Faye said, holding her hand gently. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; The 
Goddess of Love didn&#39;t know it then, but she was wrong. Dead wrong. 

***** 

      Faye was content to be walking down the hall hand in hand with Erin, but... the snake 
goddess was looking around, anxious. They were currently in a hallway inside her temple. 
&quot;Erin? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; The dark haired woman looked over at Faye. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s... My servants 
aren&#39;t usually down here, but my priestesses usually are...&quot;

      The red head laughed and gave her a deep kiss. &quot;I told you not to worry. They&#39;re 
probably doing some work.&quot; Erin gave her a strained smile. &quot;I guess you&#39;re right, but... 
Faye I want you to be careful,&quot; the snake goddess said, looking around. Faye laughed. &quot;Erin, 
nothing is going to happen to us. Even if we die, our vessels will be found and prepared.&quot;

      They were about to continue speaking, but they heard footsteps coming their way. Erin 
recognized her head priestess and some of her other servants, but... most noticeably were 
the armored men behind the priestess. They were armed and the solemn looks did nothing to 
alleviate Erin&#39;s worry. &quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot; She shouted.

      &quot;You so called gods are nothing but demons,&quot; her priestess replied. &quot;Before us stands 
a disgusting representation of lust and one who wields serpents. We all know that serpents 
are messengers of the devil.&quot; Erin grew wide eyed. She knew it. Even her servants had been 
converted. &quot;Faye,&quot; she whispered to the woman behind her. &quot;I want you to run. Posh-Posh is 
going to show you where to hide and you mustn&#39;t go back to your temple. No matter what 
happens, wait and I will find you again.&quot;

      Faye shook her head. &quot;No! I&#39;m not going to leave you here-&quot; Erin hissed something out 
and a Posh-Posh slithered into the hallway. He had grown quite a bit and without warning, 
wrapped around Faye and took her out of the hallway.

      Erin couldn&#39;t risk Faye getting hurt, even if the goddess was shouting at Posh-Posh to 
be let go. She turned back to her priestess. &quot;Why are you doing this? The gods are here to 
serve the people of this world.&quot; The priestess just shook her head. &quot;No, you are not gods. 
You are demons who&#39;re trying to lead the people into sin.&quot;

      The priestess continued to speak. &quot;And you having such a relationship with another 
woman! How can you say you are good when you support such blasphemous actions? That&#39;s why we 
must cut out all sin in our lives so we may start anew.&quot; Erin watched as the armored men 
unsheathed their swords. &quot;Please, I do not wish to hurt any of you...&quot; she murmured, but her 
plea fell upon deaf ears.

      Their followers had turned against the gods... Erin summoned horde of snakes and as 
they gathered behind her, she watched in confusion as her priestess pulled out a bag. From 
it, she tossed a powder at Erin.

      Her snakes began to writhe before they fell down dead and Erin herself was unable to 
move as the powder entered her lungs. The dark haired woman fell forward, wide eyed. &quot;Ah, 
you were right, priestess,&quot; one of the armored men said. &quot;It was good that you gained her 
trust and was able to find her weakness.&quot;

      Erin tried to move, but she couldn&#39;t. She lied there twitching on the ground... 
this... this couldn&#39;t be happening! The people she&#39;d once served... the priestess whom she&#39;d 
always trusted... They had turned on her. She watched in paralyzed fear as one of the men 
walked over.

      &quot;Cut off the demon&#39;s head and then we shall seal her spirit away,&quot; the priestess said 
and the man nodded. As Erin watched the steel blade come towards her neck, she could only 
think of one thing.... Faye... 

***** 

      &quot;Posh-Posh! You must let me go!&quot; Faye continued to struggle, but the snake had carried 
her into a secret den. It was something Erin had created for emergencies. The love goddess 
was worried. Posh-Posh... suddenly grew solemn. She could feel the depression coming off of 
him in waves.

      &quot;...Erin... do you know what happened to her?&quot; Posh-Posh made no sign, but kept the 
exit blocked. Faye walked over to the bed that was in the secret chamber and lied down. She 
would... she would wait.  

***** 

      It was the next morning when Faye awoke and found Posh-Posh missing. She frantically 
ran out of the chamber and found the exit led to the middle of a forest. Faye headed 
directly towards Erin&#39;s temple... but stopped when she saw many armored men outside of it, 
smashing the pillars and desecrating the building.

      That... that didn&#39;t mean Erin was dead... right...? Faye backed away and instead head 
towards another temple she knew of. Humans couldn&#39;t kill off the gods, right? She kept this 
thought in mind, but it soon died off when she arrived at her destination. Faye had intended 
to go to the Goddess of Parenting and God of Marriage, but... She started to cry. Men were 
setting fire to the temple and cheering.

      She sunk to her knees and bit down on her fist to keep herself from sobbing. How... 
how could this have happened? Faye had no where to go... she trekked back to the secret 
chamber and started to go through the clothes in there. If the gods were being massacred, 
then... then she couldn&#39;t just walk around normally.

      Tears slid down her cheeks as she pinned up her hair and tried to find suitable 
clothing. &quot;Oh, Erin... please... please be safe. I will be back...&quot; 

***** 

      It wasn&#39;t until a hundred years later that she returned to Erin&#39;s temple. Faye had 
pretended to be a gypsy and traveled throughout the land. By playing the role of matchmaker 
and fortune teller, she was able to thrive off the love of her clients. Even if she no 
longer received prayers, she could still gain power off of that.

      She stared at the remnants of the great structure in disdain. Wildlife and foliage had 
grown over much of it and it was starting to sink into the earth. Faye walked solemnly down 
its halls, trying to find her... Erin.

      Faye cried and cried as she walked. Part of her knew Erin was dead, but it didn&#39;t keep 
her from hoping. As she made it down to the last chamber, she knew that her beloved had been 
sealed and there was little to no chance for her revival. Faye walked into the altar room 
and fell to her knees.

      &quot;Erin! Erin...!&quot; She sobbed, placing her hands on the seal on the floor. &quot;Erin... I&#39;ll 
pray for you every night... I&#39;ll find a way... I will find a way to bring you back! 
...Erin...&quot; She wasn&#39;t sure how long she stayed there, crying, but when she left she 
promised herself that nothing would stop her from regaining her beloved. 

***** 

      &quot;...and here we are, centuries later,&quot; Faye said. Erin looked down into her lap. Faye 
had only spoke of what happened when Posh-Posh took her, but... Erin remembered how they 
killed her and her spirit was sealed away by the very people she swore to protect.

      When she looked up, she saw Faye looking at her gently. No wonder she&#39;d been so 
desperate... when she found Erin, she had to restrain herself not to scare her. Erin smiled 
back and cupped Faye&#39;s chin. She leaned in and kissed her deeply, not minding Faye&#39;s 
desperate hands wrapping around her waist. They pulled away for a second and Faye stared at 
her lovingly. &quot;Are you sure? If we start, I am not going to stop.&quot;

      Erin giggled, &quot;Yes... you jogged my memory, but... I don&#39;t want to do it with voyeurs 
around.&quot; Both of them took a look towards the shadows. Isaka and Krystal emerged, smiling 
sheepishly. &quot;S-sorry, I just... I just had to know what happened!&quot; Krystal said.

      Isaka shrugged and looped an arm around Krystal&#39;s shoulders. &quot;We&#39;re sorry to 
eavesdrop, but that was a real touching story.&quot;  Faye laughed and hugged Erin tightly. &quot;Now, 
all we need to do is find a place to enjoy each other... except, Erin, I hope you don&#39;t plan 
on leaving the room for at least a day.&quot;

      The snake goddess gulped. Great... as much as she loved Faye, this was going to be one 
heckuva night.
