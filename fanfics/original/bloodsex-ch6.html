<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 6 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>        Alex Conner raised an eyebrow, the redheaded young woman 
having heard at least some of the phone conversation. &quot;Sister,&quot; she 
frowned slightly, &quot;are you calling in a nun?&quot;

        Jess didn&#39;t choose to answer that, instead she strode on by 
the woman and out into the tattoo shop itself. The black haired 
woman waited there until Alex caught up to her and said, &quot;Don&#39;t ask 
any dumb questions when she gets here.&quot;

        &quot;Ask who..&quot; Alex started when a figure strode by the windows 
outside.

        The front door slammed open, the young lady striding inside. 
She let the door bang shut, a slim black clad figure standing in the 
dim light of the shop, a bit of white at her throat. Long brown hair 
was pulled away from her face, tied severely back in a ponytail.

        &quot;Jess,&quot; the woman&#39;s eyes glowed with a fierce anger as she 
glared at the taller tattoo artist, &quot;I told you that I&#39;d kill you if 
we ever met again.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, too, Sam,&quot; Jess seemed entirely 
unpreturbed by the death threat. A slight smile, &quot;You might want to 
hold off on killing me until later.&quot;

        Alex watched the two of them warily, seeing the electricity 
crackle between them with wide eyes. &#39;Is Jess nuts?&#39; she wondered, 
even as she tried to guess why someone dressed as a female priest 
would want the lady dead. &#39;Not that what I&#39;ve heard about the lady&#39;s 
reputation doesn&#39;t make me wonder,&#39; she admitted.

        Sam smiled slightly back at Jess, a very cold expression. 
She looked casually over at Alex and asked, &quot;Who&#39;s the cop?&quot;

        &quot;Alex Conner,&quot; Jess introduced her with a nod, &quot;I&#39;d like you 
to meet Samantha Teresa, a member of an obscure religious order 
called the Templars.&quot;

        Alex looked down at her plain clothes and sighed, &quot;How come 
everyone seems to know that I&#39;m a cop?&quot; She looked up to meet Sam&#39;s 
slightly amused gaze, &quot;Nice to meet you..&quot; she trailed off. The 
oddest look appeared on her face, &quot;Templar?&quot;

        Sam made a face at that. &quot;You really love throwing that name 
around, don&#39;t you?&quot; she gave Jess a scolding look.

        &quot;Of course I do,&quot; Jess smirked.

        Sam looked at Alex and fiercely said, &quot;Before you ask, yes, 
I am a member of the Knights of the Temple, and no, I&#39;m not going to 
explain any more than that.&quot; Back to Jess, &quot;So why have you risked 
calling me?&quot;

        &quot;Skinwalker,&quot; Jess said simply, then she quietly filled in 
the female priest about what they knew about the bodies found. 
Quietly she finished, &quot;It&#39;s hunting the bad part of town, probably 
because it can get away with it easier here.&quot;

        Alex frowned, looking at Sam. There was such a dangerous 
aura about the woman, one oddly like the one around Jess. Both women 
seemed to have seen things that others normally hadn&#39;t, experienced 
things far different that most people had. Taking a closer look, 
Alex&#39;s eyes widened. This priest had a shoulder harness on, probably 
for a pistol.

        &quot;So we need to find this thing and send it back where it 
came from,&quot; Sam said thoughtfully, &quot;not so difficult.&quot; She nodded 
towards Alex, &quot;And why is she here?&quot;

        &quot;This thing is killing people in my city,&quot; Alex decided to 
answer that one herself, &quot;and I want to see it stopped. Jess looks 
like my best bet to do that.&quot;

        Sam gave her a look, &quot;Don&#39;t rely on Jess, you&#39;ll regret it.&quot;

        Before Alex could try to form a reply to that Jess smiled 
slightly. &quot;Let&#39;s get to work, shall we?&quot; she suggested.

        Sam looked a bit surprised that Jess hadn&#39;t taken the 
bait. &quot;Right,&quot; she answered and with that the three walked out of 
the shop together.

        &quot;So how to we find this thing?&quot; Alex asked, the fall air 
just a bit cold, the sun fully set.

        &quot;Sam?&quot; Alex gave her a look.

        Sam closed her eyes, holding a cross in her two hands 
against her chest, above her heart. Her lips moved slightly, her 
voice barely a whisper as she murmured something in Latin. All 
around the silver cross a light slowly built up, shining brighter 
and brighter, until what looked like a lance of light struck out 
into the darkness.

        &quot;There,&quot; Sam said crisply.

        Not far away the bookstore was slowing down as they began to 
close up. The manager Alice Sinclare closed up the till, then she 
looked up to see a woman standing over by the magazine racks. Waving 
the rest of the staff to go the black haired woman made her way 
over, &quot;Hello, I haven&#39;t seen you here before. I&#39;m Alice.&quot;

        The woman smiled back, her teeth glinting oddly in the 
bright light. &#39;It&#39;s always nice when I know their name,&#39; the thing 
hiding within the red- gold haired beauty thought. &quot;It&#39;s nice to 
meet you, Alice,&quot; it said.

        A bright flash of light outside the window, even as Alice 
felt the oddest chill come over her. The beam of light seemed to 
come right through the wall, lighting up the odd young woman in a 
halo of white. The door slammed open, three figures running into the 
store.

        A muscle in Jess&#39; jaw clenched as she muttered, &quot;I knew I 
should have trusted my hunches.&quot; Long black coat swirling around her 
Jess looked right past Alice to the woman who was standing beside 
her, &quot;Get away from her!&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; the red-gold haired woman pushed Alice away 
from her casually, slamming her up against the wall and knocking her 
out, &quot;there&#39;s such a nice variety of skins here.&quot;

        &quot;Alice,&quot; Jess so wanted to go to her, but she focused on 
their enemy.

        Alex had her gun in her hand, holding it on the woman. &#39;She 
looks so.. human,&#39; the young police officer thought 
nervously. &quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; she ordered.

        &quot;No,&quot; the woman began to walk to wards them. Bang! The gun 
went off, then again. Bang! Both bullets were dead on target, but 
the woman merely stopped, swaying a bit. With a little frown she 
stuck a finger into one of the bullet holes, &quot;You damaged this skin.&quot;

        Ignoring Alex&#39;s stunned look Jess softly said, &quot;Sam?&quot; She 
reached into her black coat, grabbing at something as she warily 
watched the creature.

        &quot;We need to get it out of the skin before I can take it 
out,&quot; the brown haired priest said crisply, Sam having pulled a 
pistol from beneath her black garb.

        &quot;I think I can manage that,&quot; and Jess sounded truly furious 
as she pulled three gleaming throwing blades out of her coat, She 
threw, driving two deep into the startled creatures eyes, then 
another between it&#39;s breasts.

        Streams of black ooze exploded from the eyes sockets as it 
weakly cried out, &quot;You ruined this skin! Ruined it!&quot; The flesh 
touched by the ooze seemed to be corrupted, breaking down somehow.

        &quot;You haven&#39;t seen anything yet,&quot; Jess hissed. She raised her 
hands, the words coming easily to her. The knives buried in the now 
slowly rotting flesh exploded into flames, the fire spiraling up and 
out over the thing&#39;s entire body. The fire danced in a perfect 
column, burning just the body within not any of the store around 
them.

        In seconds, the tatters of flesh fell away, revealing 
something... else. It looked almost like a cloud of knives, gleaming 
blades on tendrils of flesh that bobbed and weaved in a delicate 
dance. It&#39;s didn&#39;t speak aloud anymore, instead it&#39;s voice seemed to 
cut into their brains, &quot;You ruined my skin, so I&#39;ll just have to 
take away yours.&quot;

        Sam and Alex exchanged a glance, then both guns went up and 
opened fire, Spent shells dropped around them, bullets racing into 
the cloud as it jerked and twisted in midair. The smell of gunpowder 
and oddly incense filled the air, and the thing splatted wetly to 
the ground.

        &quot;Think it&#39;s dead?&quot; Jess asked, another knife in her hand.

        &quot;Nope,&quot; Sam walked over and took a vial out of her pocked. 
Unscrewing the cap she poured the fluid over the creature, smoke 
rising from the body.

        &quot;Is that holy water?&quot; Alex asked weakly.

        &quot;Acid,&quot; Sam answered crisply, &quot;it&#39;s more effective.&quot;

        &quot;Oh,&quot; Alex blinked.

        Jess strode right by the smoking remains, reaching Alice&#39;s 
side. A bit of blood marked her brow, but other than that she looked 
all right. She got one arm under her legs, the other under her 
shoulders, then picked her up.

        Sam had the oddest look on her face as she watched Jess go 
by her, carrying her friend over to a couch. She drew a black bag 
from her pocket, calmly sweeping what was left of the creature 
inside. At Alex&#39;s curious look she said coolly, &quot;I intend to dispose 
of this thing.&quot;

        &quot;I suppose I couldn&#39;t ask you to give me that as evidence?&quot; 
Alex asked. Sam shook her head gravely no, and Alex sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know how I&#39;m going to write a report on this.&quot;

        &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; Sam advised gently, &quot;let it remain unsolved. 
There&#39;s no way that anyone on the police force would believe you 
anyway.&quot;

        Jess looked down at Alice worriedly, feeling a bit of relief 
that her eyes began to shift beneath her eyelids. Alice finally 
peeped out, looking relieved at seeing Jess there. &quot;What happened?&quot; 
she asked, wincing as she sat up.

        &quot;Nothing you need to worry about,&quot; Jess said softly.

        It was nearly a half an hour later that they all met up 
again back in front of Jess&#39; shop. The tattoo artist had taken Alice 
home, refusing to explain until tomorrow. She wasn&#39;t really looking 
forward to it, but Jess figured that Alice did deserve some answers.

        &quot;Is your friend all right?&quot; Alex asked.

        &quot;Pretty shaken up,&quot; Jess shrugged, &quot;but I put a sleeping 
charm on her. She&#39;ll sleep soundly until morning, free of 
nightmares.&quot;

        &quot;Hmm,&quot; Sam studied Jess thoughtfully.

        &quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Alex smiled wryly, offering her 
hand. &quot;I think I&#39;ll head back to the station, let the Doc. know that 
the killer&#39;s been dealt with.&quot;

        Jess shook the hand firmly, and without hesitating at all 
said, &quot;If something else like this comes up, come get me.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; and with that Alex climbed into her unmarked car 
and was gone.

        Jess turned to look at the priest, trying to read something 
in the woman&#39;s calm gaze. Finally she had to ask, &quot;Well?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve changed,&quot; Sam finally had to say, &quot;you aren&#39;t like 
when we met before.&quot;

        &quot;I guess so,&quot; Jess quietly agreed. There was a haunted look 
in her eyes as she continued, &quot;I know the evil that I did, and I 
can&#39;t even claim any good intentions. I was just a bitch, and I did 
what I was told.&quot; A pause, &quot;Happily.&quot;

        &quot;What finally pushed you too far?&quot; Sam sounded curious.

        &quot;Kids,&quot; Jess&#39; voice dropped down to a whisper, &quot;I don&#39;t hurt 
kids.&quot;

        &quot;Forgiveness isn&#39;t mine to give,&quot; Sam said, and Jess closed 
her eyes, &quot;only vengeance.&quot; A pause, &quot;So I guess I&#39;ll just have to 
kill you another time.&quot;

        A long moment of silence, and Jess opened her eyes to find 
the priest gone.</pre>
