<h1>Kindred Hearts (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiton.html">Kaiton</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A/N: Alright, you may be wondering why I have another fic in the works 
while I still have yet to finish Goddess&#39;. Thing is, this one&#39;s older 
than Goddess&#39;. I wrote the bulk of this over a year ago. I&#39;m reviving 
and revising it. I took the original first chapter and scrapped it, then 
wrote this. I have 8 chapters finished, but only the first two have been 
revised so far. I&#39;ll have the rest finished and write a completed nine 
before New Years (I hope). Ja ne, and enjoy!

Living through the pain

	I&#39;m crying, again. &#39;I can&#39;t stop crying. It&#39;s just too painful.&#39; I 
sob into my pillow yet again. &#39;I&#39;ve soaked at least half of the pillows 
I own.&#39; I turn away from the tear-stained pillow, and I see the pictures 
on the nightstand. My heart shatters further as I see your smiling face. 
&#39;My angel, my angel&#39;s gone. Gone, forever.&#39; I pass out again from the 
grief.
-------------------------------
	Sunlight pours through the cracks in the curtains. &#39;Damn you sun. 
Curse you and your cheery rays.&#39; I turn from the window as I slowly wake 
from my grief-induced slumber. I purposely slam the pictures down on the 
nightstand. &#39;I can&#39;t cry anymore right now.&#39; I turn onto my back and 
stare at the ceiling. &quot;Why?&quot; I murmur sadly.
	My thoughts are broken by the sudden, incessant knocking on my 
room&#39;s door. &quot;Go away!&quot; I shout tiredly. &quot;I don&#39;t want to see anyone!&quot; 
The knocking grows louder and more demanding. I sigh deeply and look at 
my bedside clock. It glares back at me, red and annoying. &#39;5:30 p.m.&#39; it 
reads. &quot;Damn,&quot; I curse. &quot;Go away!&quot;
        &quot;Aimee!&quot; Kylie shouted, almost pleading. &quot;Let us in! Damnit, 
we&#39;re your best friends! Let us talk to you! You can&#39;t shut yourself in 
there forever. You&#39;re going to die of starvation or dehydration. Please, 
I can&#39;t lose another friend. AIMEE!&quot;
       &quot;C&#39;mon Aimee, snap out of it!&quot; Eric commanded softly. &quot;We miss 
her too. You&#39;re not alone in your pain. Let us help; we can&#39;t get 
through this without each other. Keiko ... Keiko needs us to stand 
together. In honor of her memory, I want you to let us in. Can you at 
least talk to us?&quot;
       &quot;Shut up!&quot; I yell hoarsely. &quot;Just ... shut ... up...&quot; I break 
into tears again. &quot;I can&#39;t ...&quot; I sob. &quot;I just ... can&#39;t.&quot;
       &quot;Aimee ...&quot; Kylie&#39;s close to crying too. &quot;Please, let me in. I 
can&#39;t lose you too. We lost Keiko already. I can&#39;t ... I don&#39;t want to 
lose you too. Aimee, please, let us in.&quot; She places her hand on the 
door. &quot;Please ...&quot;
       I lay there silently. I could hear Kylie start crying as she slid 
down my bedroom door and onto the hallway floor. I closed my eyes and 
tried to shut the out, but their pleading voices wouldn&#39;t give me the 
silence I wanted. &quot;There&#39;s a key ...&quot; I whispered, &quot;under the carpet 
near the left hand door frame. You can unlock the door with it.&quot;
       &quot;Aimee,&quot; Eric sighs, &quot;thank you.&quot;
       &quot;You wouldn&#39;t let me alone if I didn&#39;t tell you,&quot; I reply sourly. 
&quot;Just say your piece and let me grieve in solitude.&quot;
       &quot;Aimee,&quot; Kylie whispers sadly. Her normally rosy cheeks are puffy 
and pale. She&#39;s been crying almost as much as I have. Her honey-brown 
eyes are dull and blood-shot. Her clothes are in disarray and her 
normally stylish, golden hair is unkempt and wild. I look at her and see 
the deep fear and grief in her eyes.
       &quot;We didn&#39;t come here to give you a lecture,&quot; Eric sighed softly. 
His chestnut-hued hair isn&#39;t combed, and it&#39;s barely clean. His normally 
deep grey eyes are cold and surrounded by dark circles. They&#39;re both 
probably suffering from insomnia. He looks at me and pulls a box of 
tissues from his bag. &quot;Look at you. You&#39;re crying yourself to death. We 
want to grieve with you, not tell you to get over her. She&#39;s our best 
friend, and she&#39;s already missed.&quot;
       &quot;I&#39;m ... sorry,&quot; I whisper hoarsely. I wipe the moisture off my 
face. My eyes are sore and puffy. The shimmer that used to fill their 
hazel hues is gone. Just like Keiko. My pajamas are soaked, and my 
red-gold hair&#39;s grimy and lifeless. There are at least twelve boxes 
worth of Kleenex scattered around me. I cough loudly and sigh again. 
&quot;Thank you for being honest. I feel alone without her.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kylie agreed. &quot;It&#39;s not the same without her. We also 
wanted to talk to you two about how close you had gotten, but now ... I 
guess we can&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;We kinda ... kinda already knew, ya know?&quot; Eric said, trying to 
grin.
	&quot;Don&#39;t ...&quot; I sniffed. &quot;Please don&#39;t. I&#39;m ... not ready. I&#39;m just 
not ready.&quot;
	&quot;Sorry,&quot; Kylie apologized. &quot;We&#39;re not trying to pry, but we just 
wanted to talk about it.&quot;
	&quot;I ... can&#39;t,&quot; I said, fighting back more tears.
	&quot;I understand Aimee,&quot; Eric comforted. &quot;You want us to stay?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; I sighed. &quot;I feel a little better with you two here. You 
can sit down if you want.&quot;
	&quot;You want to ... um ...&quot; Kylie got lost, as she sat on the edge of 
the bed. &quot;Well ... now that we&#39;re here, what do we do?&quot;
	&#39;Typical Kylie,&#39; I think quickly. I give a small chuckle and look 
at her sternly. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to be mourning, not laughing,&quot; I say 
jokingly.
	&quot;Laughing&#39;s good,&quot; Eric says in a doctor-like tone. &quot;It helps the 
mind and heals the heart.&quot;
	I can&#39;t help but laugh as he puffs out his chest. I look at him 
with sharp glare and still can&#39;t help but laugh at the face he makes in 
return. &#39;I missed these two,&#39; I sigh ruefully. &quot;Thanks guys,&quot; I say 
softly. &quot;I guess I needed that.&quot;
	&quot;Well,&quot; Kylie starts in a motherly tone, &quot;it won&#39;t do to have you 
cooped up in here crying your eyes out, slowly wasting away in grief. 
Besides, I thought you&#39;d be hungry.&quot; She whips out a small basket 
holding a small lunch for me.
	&quot;I knew you had that thing hidden somewhere,&quot; I moan. &quot;Why do you 
use your sub-space techniques to store stuff like that?&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s convenient,&quot; Eric answers for her. &quot;I do the same thing.&quot;
	&quot;Figures,&quot; I say gruffly. &quot;What&#39;d you bring?&quot;
	&quot;Your favorites,&quot; Kylie answers, opening the box she pulled from 
the basket. &quot;Eat up.&quot; She hands me the box and a set of plastic 
silverware.
	&quot;Thanks,&quot; I mutter through a full mouth.
	Eric and Kylie&#39;s jaws drop as they watch me wolf down the food 
unceremoniously. They glance at each other, and then turn back to me, 
completely speechless.
	&quot;Wha?&quot; I say through a mouth full. &quot;I WAS hungry, so sue me.&quot;
	With that, Kylie and Eric burst into laughter. I look at them 
incredulously. &quot;What!?&quot; I demand.
	&quot;Oh ... oh goddess,&quot; Kylie moans through her laughing fit. &quot;Geez, 
you should have seen how wolfish you were with that food, Aimee.&quot;
	Eric can&#39;t catch his breathe enough to string two words together. 
He moans and grabs his ribs. &quot;Hurts ...&quot; he laughs.
	&quot;You ...&quot; I growl. &quot;It wasn&#39;t THAT funny, you dope!&quot; I proceed to 
whack him over the head with my soaked pillow. There was a slight squish 
and a disgusted groan from Eric.
	&quot;Wet ...&quot; He murmured. &quot;Ick ...&quot;
	&quot;Oops!&quot; I laughed.
	&quot;Oops indeed, Aimee,&quot; Eric said dryly. &quot;May I have a towel now 
that I was hit by a sopping, tear-filled pillow?&quot;
	Kylie gave him a bemused smirk as she went into my linen closet to 
fetch a dry towel. &quot;Guess it&#39;s good I didn&#39;t laugh that hard,&quot; She said, 
her voiced laced with controlled mirth. As soon as she came into view, 
she was hit by the same pillow that Eric had been struck by a minute 
ago. &quot;Spoke too soon. Good thing I grabbed a more than one towel. Here 
take it.&quot; She offered a towel to Eric as she wiped her face dry. &quot;At 
least you feel a little better, right Aimee?&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, I do,&quot; I answered. &quot;But, I still hurt. I wish I could have 
stopped her.&quot;
	&quot;Feh,&quot; Eric sighed. &quot;Fat chance of ever doing that. She always was 
stubborn as a damned mule. You know that better than both of us Aimee.&quot;
	&quot;Point,&quot; I conceded. &quot;That, I always found, to be one of her most 
charming qualities. Never backed down, and always did what she set out 
to do. I guess, in a way, that&#39;s what I&#39;ll miss the most.&quot;

Kaiton&#39;s Afterthoughts:
	Well? I wanted to be as realistic as I could; writing from a 
female&#39;s POV. I hope to hear what you all think. This happens to be my 
favorite fictional work to date. You can always e-mail me, or you can 
hit me up on MSN. Thanks for reading!
