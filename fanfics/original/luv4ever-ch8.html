<p align="justify"><strong>Elila&rsquo;s   POV</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Patrol seems   to be slow tonight as I lazily jogged and hopped on buildings to buildings   as I come across, while focusing below the city with a determination   of mind. I had just reported to Inspector Lester about the incident   last night, while leaving out the specific reason why I was careless   enough to not even finish the duty last night. But it all turns out   good as my father had cleared up my mess and brought the two guys to   the police station with the help of my cousin, Ross Savage as he could   feel my whereabouts here and there, for his blood flows deeply in me.   Good old Inspector Lester for he thought I was perhaps too weary and   in need to finish my school work for today&rsquo;s school. I tried to chuckle   at that moment but just politely agreed with him and went off to start   my duty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I find it peculiar   that this night the criminals seem to be in their best behaviour. Hmmm&hellip;I   should be in high spirits, not puzzled by this thought of mine so I   guess I&rsquo;m the odd one. Taking a sigh, I finally slowed down and jumped   down a 10th floor storey &ndash;building and landed gracefully   at a small park and start wandering around. I looked up at the sky and   it seems to be filled with beautiful shinning stars and the half moon   seems to be so bright for sensitive eyes. As I stared directly towards   the bright moon, in an instant my silver eyes glowed brightly and sort   of frightened the locals that were walking around the park, yet relaxes   when they realized who I was and just walk pass me and greeted me politely   before leaving me alone. After a few short bows of responding their   greeting, I then started exploring the river and sit near the bushes   just to hear contently the sound of its water. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">My thoughts   seem to be busy this night, simply thinking about the lunch time with   little belle that seems to be so clear in my mind, repeating the scene   that was captured photographically again and again. The shy glances,   the innocent touches and a re-born friendship&hellip;or was it something   else? I could even feel the beast within me, seemingly being content   by this knowledge and wagging its own tail, while my human side seems   to be in such a daze mode. Now which part of me is mad at the moment?   The beast within me or my human self?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I shake my   head aggressively as both of my hands went on top of my head, thinking   to myself if I have gone insane. I seem to be feeling different as every   hour or minutes have passed by and I&rsquo;m suddenly feeling afraid. <strong> &ldquo;I have to see her,&rdquo;</strong> I whispered to myself, feeling somewhat   overwhelmed by the realization of that. How could this feeling be so   strong as if our <strong><em>&lsquo;friendship&rsquo;</em></strong> seems to be growing   closer for a decade or more, while I have only managed to meet her face-to-face   again just last night. How much stronger this mate bond would go? Would   it make us both go to the edge until we would find passion one day&hellip;or   would we find regrets? I shook my head again and thought, <strong><em>&lsquo;Enough   of that, it is time to see her again.&rsquo; </em></strong> Feeling my heart beating faster and faster by the thought of that, I   got up from my sitting place and sprint a little as I jumped up high   to the sky so I could shape-shift into a falcon and flew as fast as   I could to reach my faithful destination, Isabella&hellip;whom I fear to   call it my home.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">As I passed   the forest below me, knowing fully well that I&rsquo;ll be reaching her   house soon, even with a body of a falcon, I could feel something funny   in my stomach and the feeling of wanting to smile goofily seems to betray   my controlled features. Am I already in love? Oh god I don&rsquo;t think   so. I mean, I know I can feel the love for Isabella, the love to protect   her&hellip;the love of being her best friend and all of that. But falling   in love? Isn&rsquo;t that too soon? Yes&hellip;it&rsquo;s too soon. I won&rsquo;t let   this mate bond manipulate my thoughts!! Ignoring what I was thinking   slightly, I finally reached little belle&rsquo;s window&rsquo;s balcony and   shape-shifted back to human. Once I landed gracefully yet silently,   I quickly check the surroundings with alertness. Alerting my sensitive   hearings to hear any heartbeats or noises in the house, I found two   heartbeats that seem to be sleeping soundly in the other room, which   probably would be Isabella&rsquo;s parents. And of course, another heartbeat   that belongs to a person I found her sitting on the floor at the end   of the room just at the edge of the bed, and that heartbeat belongs   to Isabella herself. But yet, I feel saddened when I see her upset face,   as if she has been crying before I arrived. Her eyes were a little puffy   with redness and I see her cell phone besides her. <strong><em>&lsquo;Did she   just argue with Melvin?&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought angrily. How could he do   that to her?! She belongs to him, what MORE does he wants?!&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I clenched   my fists tightly, knowing fully well that if I clench any more tighter   than this, I&rsquo;ll surely draw out blood from my very own hands. My visions   somehow became red again and inside me, I panicked a little&hellip;wondering   how am I going to control myself. My parents are not here to help me   this time&hellip;would I get out of control and seek for vengeance? The beast   in me awakens for the need of Melvin&rsquo;s blood and somehow able to control   my body to turn around and wanting to fly outside to seek for the prey.   I tried to shape- shift when&hellip;&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila?   Is that you?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I immediately   turned around to look at little belle. Even with the state she is in,   she looks at me with such tenderness that somehow my vision becomes   colourful once again. My beast seems to calm down and starts wagging   its tail happily and the thought of blood clears out of my mind and   been replaced with concerned and loved for her. I blinked for a moment,   quite surprised by how effective Isabella&rsquo;s voice could do to me.   But she didn&rsquo;t look at me long as she turns her head and leaned back   on the bed, seemingly too upset to give a proper greeting. Feeling ashamed   that my duty as a friend is suppose to cheer her up, not to actually   find vengeance at this moment, I tried to think of ways on how to cheer   her up. <strong><em>&lsquo;Give her flowers? Nope&hellip;too plain. Give her chocolates?   Is every girl&rsquo;s best friend&hellip;nope&hellip;not at this condition&hellip;you don&rsquo;t   want her to be fat right? Good point,&rsquo; </em></strong> I thought to myself. Puzzled, I take this minute to think something   different. Then, I got the perfect idea&hellip;something simple yet somehow   effective for my little belle.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I quietly got   off the window, taking small steps towards her, not wanting to shock   her in any ways. Then slowly, I shape-shift myself to something that   I never really thought of doing since my hectic training a year ago   - and that is a baby greyish adorable wolf. Okay, I know it wouldn&rsquo;t   be the perfect idea to cheer up all the girls as for sure they would   be running the other way, but I remembered how little belle loves wolves   yet at the same time, feared them. So I take this chance to be a baby   wolf&hellip;not a adult wolf as she would probably be overwhelmed so a baby   wolf would do just nice.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">As I neared   her, I barked which comes out more like a <strong>&ldquo;Yip! Yip!&rdquo;</strong> sound. <strong><em> &lsquo;Great, now I sound like the perfect baby wolf,&rsquo;</em></strong> I thought   to myself sarcastically. But it did get little belle&rsquo;s attention as   she slowly turned to look at me and somehow froze in place. I wanted   to tell her that it was me and tried yet I could hear myself saying <strong> &ldquo;Yip! Yip!&rdquo;</strong> again, and slowly I moved towards her and placed   my muzzle on her legs. She somehow just stared at me with wide eyes   and I suddenly begin to think if this was a good idea or not. But somehow,   she looks up ahead, perhaps looking at the window and realized that   I wasn&rsquo;t there now, and then she looks at me questioningly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yip!   Yip!&rdquo;</strong> I answered her and begin wagging my small fluffy tail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Realizing that   it was me, she just stared at me&hellip;then slowly touches my forehead with   a little bit of hesitation. <strong>&ldquo;So soft,&rdquo;</strong> she said as she slowly   becomes braver and pat my forehead softly. As for me, being a little   bold, I crept towards her lap and lay there, and looking at her as if   a baby received his first Christmas present from Santa. Isabella then   chuckled and starts playing with me, touching my fur coat and scratching   my tummy once in a while until sometimes I wonder if she forgets that   I&rsquo;m not really a real baby wolf. But then again, I realized that she   would be a wonderful person to bring and meet the wolves later. Making   her happy is such a wonderful thing as she continues playing with me   and sometimes I&rsquo;ll bite her hands playfully yet not hurting her at   the same time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Wolfie!   My little Wolfie,&rdquo;</strong> she giggled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Hearing that,   I hurriedly wanted to get away from her but I heard her laughter as   she hugs me to her tightly, not wanting to let go of me. I struggled   with a few <strong>&ldquo;Yip Yip&rdquo;</strong> from me and then she reluctantly let   me go as I hurriedly changed back to my human self. Once I did that,   I looked at her with such horror and said, <strong>&ldquo;Wolfie?! You called   me Wolfie?!&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Isabella starts   laughing out loud and managed to say, <strong>&ldquo;Well, it suits you! You&rsquo;re   not really the big bad wolf you know.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">That was it.   She had playfully <strong><em>&lsquo;insulted&rsquo;</em></strong> me. This means punishment! <strong> &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! You will be punished for calling a protector a Wolfie!&rdquo;</strong> I said playfully and pounced on her as I hear her shrieked and tried   to struggle to get away from my punishment. I was straddling her thighs   as I pinned her on the floor, holding both of her hands above her head   as I start my torturous punishment. Knowing that she couldn&rsquo;t escape   from me, she cried and asked for forgiveness with a hint of laughter&hellip;but   I would not have that. And so the punishment starts now as I tickle   her ribs gently and hear her squirmed beneath me and her cries of saying   stop&hellip;but I still continued until she was already <strong><em>&lsquo;tortured&rsquo;</em></strong> by my so-called-punishment. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I let her calm   down as I unexpectedly watched her breasts heaving up and down from   her breathing. Then I suddenly realized it was such a intoxicating to   see such a display as I slowly look up to her and amazed by how her   face seems to glow. Her hair was spread everywhere and she was such   a goddess to see. She looks at me calmly when she tries to get her breath   back to normal and I still have he pinned on the floor and my right   hand still holding her hands above her. I think she wasn&rsquo;t aware that   she starts moving her legs up and down as much as she can and I felt   slightly uncomfortable between my legs as I shifted uncomfortably, realizing   I&rsquo;m grinding on her thighs! Then I suddenly felt my body responding   a little too strong and my eyes glowed a little too bright yet I wonder   why little belle looking at me so contently. But shaking my head, I   got up from her and put some distance between us and went back to the   window to sit there, just to control my body again. Oh god, how am I   going to do this EVERY DAY? Taking a deep breath, I leaned on the sides   of the window and look outside the forest. There was not a sound to   hear, just the rustling of leaves when the wind blows at them every   once in a while. Feeling that my body is back in control, I take a deep   breath and look outside tiredly. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila?   Are you alright?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I turned my   head to see her, couldn&rsquo;t help thinking she was such a goddess, wearing   a white sleeping gown that shows off her body. I felt my mouth went   dry yet I try to not think anything sexual and be calmer. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   alright little belle. Are you?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Much   better. Thank you for cheering me up.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re   welcome.&rdquo; </strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Then silence   approached us for a while yet it was a calm one. I see her wrapping   herself, unconditionally rubbing her arms with her hands as she shivers   slightly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Are you   cold little belle?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">She didn&rsquo;t   answer as she just shakes her head to say yes. I just look at her, not   really knowing what to do. Should I leave her now? But I feel like I   don&rsquo;t wish to go yet. Do I ask her to sleep now? What should I do?   But while thinking, I was surprised that Isabella approached me with   the need of something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Hold   me.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I looked at   her blankly, just too surprised to hear such a request from her.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m   really cold Elila. Please hold me?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Seeing her   face that she really needs it, I nodded and open my arms wide enough   to invite her to come and curled on top of me. She didn&rsquo;t for a moment,   as she looks out of the window, fearing that we both would fall but   I gave her my silent nod that I won&rsquo;t let us fall. For a moment, she   thought about it but being too cold she lay on top of me and began to   make herself comfortable. She put her hand on my breast as she lays   her head on my chest. I thought to myself that this is a little too   intimate but brushed that thought off as I let my black wings grew so   it could wrap us with it&rsquo;s warmness. After Isabella settles herself,   I tried to make some ways to make us a little more comfortable, or at   least for her so if I&rsquo;m going to suffer an extreme back pain, I&rsquo;ll   deal with it later. Right now, I have to focus on little belle&rsquo;s comfort.   Slightly moving here and there, I hear her sigh contently, and I start   to relax slowly and wrapped my arms around her as my wings folded us   tightly yet with ease.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Comfortable?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Yes&hellip;thank   you.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re   welcome,&rdquo;</strong> I whispered softly and half-smiled, as I withdraw my   right hand from her waist and bring it out from the protected wings   of mine, so I could caress her hair softly. She moaned softly from my   touch and curled in deeper to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Elila,   you&rsquo;re making me sleepy.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Then   go to sleep little belle. It&rsquo;s been a long day for you.&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;But&hellip;&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>&ldquo;Hush   hush little belle. I&rsquo;ll be here till you sleep. Now sleep,&rdquo; </strong> I softly command her and somehow she gives in and curled deeper and   deeper until her face was nuzzling my neck and hands are now on my chest.   I should find this somehow intimate and a little sexual yet I&rsquo;m surprised   that my body doesn&rsquo;t seem to respond at this moment. So feeling content,   I keep on caressing her hair until I hear her breathing become somewhat   different and realized that she has fallen asleep soundly. I waited   for awhile as I look outside, feeling the slight breeze passing through   us. I could hear the crickets moving at the nearest bushes, which was   placed in Isabella&rsquo;s garden and I look at the sky and sense that dawn   is coming soon. Knowing that this is the best time to leave, I pulled   back a little so I could kiss her forehead and I slowly and gently pick   Isabella up so I wouldn&rsquo;t wake her up. Seeing that she is still asleep,   I walked up to the bed, using my mind to separate the bedspread that   was neatly placed on her bed and gently placed little belle on the bed.   She whimpered a little from being away from my warmness in a sudden,   so I quickly took the bedspread and covered her so she won&rsquo;t feel   cold. And when I see her sleeping comfortable on her bed, I told myself   to go now yet couldn&rsquo;t help looking at her face&hellip;such fragile that   held there and amazing beautiful.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I touched her   face with such care and I felt overwhelmed with emotions in me. I felt   confused again, thinking why these emotions too strong all of a sudden.   Then flashbacks of meeting Isabella for the first time since we were   thirteen years old somehow makes my heart glee for joy&hellip;of putting   a distance between us stabs my heart with a knife that was so painful&hellip;then   meeting again face-to-face for the first time in a year gives my heart   a new meaning of life somehow&hellip;and then knowing Melvin and her together   that I somehow accepted it yet gives my heart a whole new meaning of   the word &ndash; poison. Why am I feeling these again? Could it be&hellip;no   it can&rsquo;t be! It&rsquo;s too soon&hellip;or is it not? &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Battling with   my emotions, I again look at her but for the first time, with a different   perspective. I caressed her face with softness and felt overpowered   with the softness of skin I felt there. I looked at her differently,   as not like a friend but as my&hellip;future mate. Her thick long hair spread   along the pillows and her fair face holds such beauty that could take   my breath away. As I dared myself to look downwards, her breasts are   full and rounded&hellip;like an art that is so hard to find and her slender   body has such curves like a Venus goddess. And the thought of that,   her love of friendship for me and at times, her trust towards me is   unlimited. Even after all the odds that happen, she somehow wishes to   know me again. How hard to find that nowadays? In conclusion, I felt&hellip;happy.   Does this mean I have the perfect mate? My half soul? But isn&rsquo;t it   too soon? But if it is, is not that bad right?&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Tears now fall   freely from my eyes as I smiled in realization. I leaned in closer to   her face and whispered with a full meaning from the bottom of my heart   and soul, <strong>&ldquo;The path in front of us would be hard, that I could   feel. But no matter what, I want you to know that whatever happens ahead   of us whether you would choose me as your own or not, I wish to let   you know that I&rsquo;ll always love you&hellip;I&rsquo;m in love with you, Isabella   Brooke with all my heart and soul. I&rsquo;ll protect you with every power   and love I have for you to keep you safe from harm. I promise you that.&rdquo;</strong> Not caring whether she had heard my confession or not, I lightly kissed   her cheek and watched her sleep contently before leaving her. Walking   towards the balcony window, I jumped out and gracefully landed on the   grass and entered the forest. &nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I could feel   a different breeze as it lightly brushes my skin&hellip;a morning breeze.   I breathe in the fresh air that has a slight mixture of the forest&rsquo;s   scent. Morning has come and I realized with all the emotions these past   two days, makes me want to sleep in peace&hellip;finally. I started taking   a slow walk back to my home through the forest when I hear a cry of   the wolf nearby.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>&ldquo;Wolf-girl,   what seems to make your heart sing?&rdquo;</strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">It is so strange   to hear a wolf&rsquo;s cry near to day time as mostly the wolves would be   active in howling and be very playful when the night falls especially   during the full moon. So I slowed down for a moment and focus on where   the wolf might possibly be.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;Brother,   reveal yourself as I&rsquo;m exhausted to play hide and seek game,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Should   you not be protecting your offspring at this hour?&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">As I waited   for its reply, a huge black wolf appeared from behind a tree as we silently   acknowledged each others&rsquo; presence. I recognized him as a great hunter   and a great father to its children. But I&rsquo;m puzzled why he is so away   from him territory. So I asked him mentally.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;What   makes you leave your own territory, brother?</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Are your   cubs and mate well?&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Then he answered   me with a little of a friendly bark and comes closer towards me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;I feel   you&rsquo;re somewhat changing wolf-girl, yet it&rsquo;s pleasant,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>I have   seen you grew from a mere child before I have my mate,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Your changing   makes me wonder and I must leave my home to ask you what is.&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I chuckled   and walked towards him to give him a pat on his forehead. I remembered   him since I was a child as he protected me in the wild when I was very   new and scared of every living creature. He was the first to seek my   trust and everyday I watched him grew from a loner to finding a beautiful   loving mate, and now having his own family and territory. I couldn&rsquo;t   wait to tell him how I feel at this moment.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;I found   the one brother! I found my mate! And I&rsquo;m in love at long last!&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">My confession   makes him howl aloud with joy as he came nearer and nuzzled my legs   playfully. I touched his soft black fur happily yet at the same time;   the nagging feeling of doubts comes to my mind.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;But   what if she doesn&rsquo;t feel the bond?</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>What is   she chooses the other rather than me?&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">The wolf didn&rsquo;t   answer me as he just walks away from me slowly. I questioned by his   sudden changed of behaviour yet I quietly followed him. As I walked   besides him, I placed my hand on his fur as we walk together.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;Are   you troubled wolf-girl, of what the consequences would come?&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">Hearing his   question, I stayed silent yet he seems to know what my answer would   be.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;Mating   is a wonderful thing but for humans I have no clue,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Whether   you face the light or the dark when the time comes,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Do not   fear for you are loved by many,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Have faith   in your bond between the two of you,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Nothing   is easy though nothing is impossible,</em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Just have   faith and what you dream would be true.&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I thought for   awhile on what he said. He is such a wise wolf and sometimes I think   I&rsquo;m still a mere child to him.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>&ldquo;Thank   you wise brother.&rdquo;</em></strong>&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="justify">I hear him   howl a little and he starts to sprint forward. I watched him going through   the trees, thinking he would now disappear in the woods to go back to   his family. But he turns around and looks at me with an invitation to   join him as he howls with so much joy. I laughed at his sudden giddiness   and give in to join the run, as I changed to a black-white wolf, slightly   smaller than him and run towards him. He waits for me as we both nuzzle   each other, acknowledging each other as wolves and run through the woods   so we both could go back home.&nbsp;</p>
