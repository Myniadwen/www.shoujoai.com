<a href="../original/wild-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>It was the crackling of a fire that finally woke
Carmen Henderson, the warmth o her face and a reddish
glow just beyond her closed eyes. The redhead opened
her eyes, trying to gather jumbled thoughts back
together while she sat up... then stiffened as memory
rushed back.

&quot;You&#39;re awake,&quot; Diana said tentatively as she emerged
from the woods, the glossy black haired young woman
returning to the campsite with a load of small
branches. She set them down by the fire, giving Carmen
some space as she sat across fro her, the flames
flickering between them. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Carmen asked, her voice breaking as
memories of impossibilities raced across her mind.

Diana hesitated, taking a twig and then absent
mindedly poking at the fire with it. &quot;You met my
mother out there in the woods,&quot; she deliberately
didn&#39;t meet Carmen&#39;s eyes, &quot;I guess the shock was too
much for you.&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Carmen blinked, &quot;I almost expected you to tell
me I imagined it.&quot;

Diana smiled grimly, &quot;I was tempted, believe me.&quot;

Carmen put her chin on her knees, wrapping her arms
around her legs as she softly asked, &quot;So why didn&#39;t
you?&quot;

Diana stirred the flames slightly before laying a few
more twigs on the golden coals. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to lie
to you,&quot; she finally said, &quot;I like you too much for
that.&quot;

A blush colored Carmen&#39;s cheeks and she looked away
from Diana shyly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she murmured softly.

&quot;If you think you&#39;re going to be all right,&quot; Diana
said reluctantly, &quot;then I think I should go.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Carmen looked alarmed, &quot;But why?&quot;

Diana stood up jerkily, the firelight putting her face
into shadow as she looked away. &quot;What I&#39;ve told you,&quot;
she said, looking like she was ready to bolt, &quot;it&#39;s
all so strange and bizarre... I don&#39;t want to force my
strangeness on you.&quot;

Carmen spoke up before Diana could walk away from her,
&quot;Yes, it is strange.. but I don&#39;t want you to go.&quot;
Diana looked back curiously as Carmen continued a bit
nervously, &quot;I think I like you too much to do that,
too.&quot;

Diana studied her a moment, trying to read her
sincerity, then with a wry smile Diana sat back down
again, this time a bit closer. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she smiled
in a sudden, self-mocking sort of way, &quot;I didn&#39;t
really want to sleep in a bush again, anyway.&quot;

&quot;You sleep where?!&quot; Carmen blurted.

Diana actually chuckled softly as she explained,
&quot;Considering my parentage, most animals tend to just
leave me alone.&quot;

Blushing faintly Carmen admitted, &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought
about it.&quot; She looked at Diana curiously, &quot;But isn&#39;t
it uncomfortable?&quot;

&quot;Somewhat,&quot; Diana chuckled as she continued
thoughtfully, &quot;I try to do it more to... understand my
mother and her people.&quot;

&quot;Not my style,&quot; Carmen admitted. She looked towards
her tent and vehicle, &quot;This is about as rough as I
like to get.&quot;

&quot;I do like the comforts of civilization, too,&quot; Diana
conceded impishly, &quot;my apartment in the city has all
the conveniences.&quot; She looked up into the night sky,
the stars twinkling overhead, &quot;Mother wouldn&#39;t
approve, I suspect.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Carmen nodded, gazing at Diana&#39;s face. &#39;She&#39;s
so beautiful,&#39; she thought, her pulse beating loudly
in her ears. &quot;What do your adoptive parents think?&quot;
Carmen asked, more focused on the shape of her lips
than her actual answer.

&quot;I&#39;ve never told them about the wolf thing,&quot; Diana
admitted, &quot;they&#39;re nice people, but I think they
wouldn&#39;t be able to cope.&quot; She studied Carmen a
moment, &quot;You know, except for the fainting you&#39;re
handling this well.&quot;

&quot;I fainted,&quot; Carmen echoed, blushing. &quot;God,&quot; she
laughed and covered her face with her hands, &quot;I&#39;ll
never live that down.&quot; Mock mournfully she added with
a dramatic sigh, &quot;If this gets out my street
credibility is shot.&quot;

Diana laughed softly, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll keep it our
little secret.&quot; A moment&#39;s pause and she added
impishly, &quot;Besides, I thought it was cute.&quot;

&quot;Oh, cute is it?&quot; Carmen laughed, her cheeks flushed.
Behind the amusement she could feel the thread of
attraction between them once again, and it was a good
feeling. &quot;Watch it,&quot; she warned, &quot;or I&#39;ll make you
sleep outside the tent.&quot;

That made Diana snicker softly, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s only one problem with you staying over,&quot;
Diana looked up at her as Carmen continued, &quot;there&#39;s
only one sleeping bag.&quot;

Diana studied her face a moment, &quot;So I guess we&#39;d have
to share?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Carmen said, glad to see the slow smile
spreading across Diana&#39;s face.

Diana reached out to lay her hand on Carmen&#39;s, &quot;I
can&#39;t think of anyone I&#39;d rather be sharing a sleeping
bag with.&quot;

&quot;You say the sweetest things,&quot; and Carmen gave into
the temptation and bent over to press her lips to
Diana&#39;s. It began as a chaste kiss, a soft brushing of
flesh, then Diana gently grasped her shoulders and
pulled her close. With increasing passion they
continued, mouths opening so that tongues could wetly
duel.

Finally pulling apart Diana panted softly, &quot;This isn&#39;t
the best place to be doing this.&quot;

Carmen pulled herself to her feet on visibly shaky
legs then offered Diana her hand, &quot;Then let&#39;s go in
the tent, huh? Otherwise, I&#39;m going to take you right
out here.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to that first night we shared hot-dogs,&quot;
Diana admitted as they crossed the camp, only taking a
moment to make sure the fire was safely hemmed in by
it&#39;s ring of stones.

&quot;I knew you only wanted me for my hot-dog,&quot; Carmen
joked as she pushed the flap of the tent aside,
getting a snort of laughter from Diana.

&quot;Trust me,&quot; Diana purred as she tugged Carmen towards
the sleeping bag, &quot;I&#39;d want you with or without the
hot-dogs.&quot;

&quot;You really are sweet,&quot; Carmen chuckled, flipping open
the bag to that it spread out over the floor of the
tent. She knelt, reaching up to tug Diana down beside
her where they joined together in another intense
kiss.

&quot;No, I&#39;m the big bad wolf,&quot; Diana gave her a grin as
she slid down, kissing her neck the down to the
junction of her neck, &quot;and I&#39;m going to eat you all
up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to make any jokes,&quot; Carmen laughed
softly, then gasped as Diana slid down to her aching
breasts.

&quot;I don&#39;t know about joking,&quot; Diana bit just once,
gently, &quot;but we&#39;re going to have a good time tonight.&quot;

&quot;Is that a promise?&quot; Carmen asked breathlessly.

&quot;More like a guarantee.&quot;

0o0o0

Carmen couldn&#39;t explain what woke her, but she found
herself alone on the sleeping bag, her body still
sated from the night&#39;s activities. &quot;Diana?&quot; she
murmured drowsily, but there was no reply. Opening up
her eyes she was disappointed to see that she was all
alone, then her eyes widened when she saw the note
resting beside her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; it began in elegant script, &quot;but I lied
to you yesterday. I am a were, like my mother, I just
choose to split my time between a human life in the
city and here as a wolf. I didn&#39;t want to scare you,
and I was too attracted to you to dare tell you the
truth.&quot;

Carmen looked at the note, fighting back a few tears
as she murmured, &quot;The way I felt last night, I&#39;d never
be scared of you.&quot;

The note continued, &quot;I couldn&#39;t continue to lie to
you, and I was too frightened to stay once you knew
the truth. If you can forgive me my deception I&#39;ve
left my business card here, in hopes that you&#39;ll
contact me. If not, I will always treasure this night.
Love, Diana.&quot;

Scrambling around Carmen found the card, noting with
some amusement that in her city life Diana was a
professor in biology, specializing in land predators.
On the back her home and pager numbers were written,
both in the same lovely print as the note. Without
thinking too much she put the card and note in her
wallet then began to dress, right before packing up
her camp.

&quot;Yes I&#39;ll contact you,&quot; Carmen murmured as she climbed
into the cab of her truck. A fond smile teased her
lips, &quot;I still owe you for last night, Diana.&quot;
