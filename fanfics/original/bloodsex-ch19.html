<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 19 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>The punches weren&#39;t delivered with grace or style, but
they certainly had a great deal of force. She hammered
the punching bag, hands carefully wrapped in bandages,
jerking the heavy object back and forth as she struck.
First right then left, forming a graceful rhythym that
seemed to soothe her even as the sweat flew.

As Jess Drake powerfully punched away she tried not to
think at all, blanking her mind to everything that was
going on in her life... or any recent complications.
&#39;Like the fact I&#39;m being followed,&#39; Jess thought, her
wet black hair falling in front of her eyes.

Over the past week Jess had caught sight of tails
twice, a young man and a classy sort of woman and she
suspected there were more. With care they had
sdhadowed her to and from work, over to the Daughters
and a few other places, too. That annoyed her,
especially since it limited what Jess could do... for
instance she had deliberately avoided the Sisterhood
bookstore. As much as she wanted to try to talk to
Alice, she was not leading a unknown enemy right to
her.

A final blow and Jess stopped, pantig softly as she
tried to fight back the slight quiver in her arms. She
was out of shape, at least a little, and it showed in
the burning of her arms and shoulders. Walking over to
where she left her towel she mopped up the sweat, not
really caring how her sweat soaked top clung to her
flesh along with her matching shorts.

The old gym had seen better days, in fact it could
even be called a dive, but it suited Jess nicely. It
wasn&#39;t far from her work or home, it wasn&#39;t too pricey
and most of the staff minded their own business. Even
better most of the customers didn&#39;t mind sparing with
her, especially when she wanted to work off some
steam.

&quot;Hey, Drake,&quot; Matt said with a grin the younger man
looking at her with a smile... and pointedly trying
not to look at the body revealed by her tight clothes.

&#39;He&#39;s trying to be a gentleman,&#39; Jess thought with
amusement, &#39;how cute.&#39; Aloud she asked, &quot;Still stayig
out of trouble, Matt?&quot;

&quot;Trying, anyway,&quot; Matt conceded, his red hair a little
messy from his own work out. His ow muscle shirt was
damp with sweat, along with the boxing trunks he
normally wore, At nealy six foot tall he looked down
at her a little, but not by much.

Jess gave him a look, &quot;If you&#39;re looking for me,
you&#39;re already in trouble.&quot;

Matt laughed quietly, &quot;No, not this time... I just
wanted to tell you that a strange woman was asking
around here about you.&quot;

Jess felt a flash of interest, &quot;Oh?&quot;

Matt passed a card over, &quot;She even left this.&quot;

Jess turned the card over, frowning slightly as she
read it. &quot;Yamazaki Investigations?&quot; she blinked, &quot;What
does a private investigator want with me?&quot;

&quot;Been getting into trouble lately?&quot; Matt asked.

&#39;Well, yes,&#39; Jess thought, &#39;but I spotted the first
tail a bit before I hit the drug house.&#39; Instead she
said, &quot;Thaks Matt, stop by the shop and I&#39;ll give you
a break on a tattioo.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Matt laughed.

Carrying the card Jess headed for the change room,
considering what she was going to do about this.
&#39;Other than paying our friends at Yamazaki
Investigations a little visit,&#39; she thought as she
stripped, dropping clothes into her gym bag and
walking to the shower.

Clean, changed and with a bounce to her step Jess
headed out, glad to be doing something active rather
than reactive. She headed home first, dropping her
gear off before heading out again, this time back to
the shop. she reluctantly put a notice up that she was
going to be closed for the dat, then headed into the
back to get ready...

Over at the offices of Yamazaki Investigations there
was a long moment of silence, then Lucy Yamazaki
repeated, &quot;What do you mean, we&#39;ve dead ended?&quot;

Tom looked glum, but the younger man still was willing
to meet her eyes directly. &quot;I mean exactly that,&quot; he
answered her, &quot;I can&#39;t find anything on the woman
called Jess Drake before five years ago, when we found
out she first turned up in the city.&quot;

&quot;And we know Drake is probably a assumed name,&quot; Lucy
noted, the gorgeous asian woman rubbing at her eyes
tiredly. &quot;No luck with the facial recognition
software, either?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I ran Drake&#39;s pic through the department of motor
vehicles, police databases and even the FBI,&quot; Tom
answered promptly, &quot;no dice.&quot; He smiled grimly, &quot;I
even thought she might have had plastic surgery, but
nothing came up there too.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Lucy murmured.

Rose didn&#39;t wait for a prompt, instead the brown
haired young woman handed over a set of papers. &quot;I&#39;m
much the same,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;I can give chapter
and verse on what she&#39;s done in the city, but nothing
before that, I&#39;m sorry to say.&quot;

&quot;No one&#39;s talking?&quot; Lucy asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Rose shook her head, &quot;it&#39;s more like no one
really knows anything. They&#39;ll happily talk about what
Jess had done either for or to them, but her
background... is a blank.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Lucy looked up at the ceiling for a moment then
asked, &quot;Give me the Readers Digest version of what we
have so far, then.&quot;

&quot;For the first few months after Jess arrived at the
city she was a street magician and tattoo artist, not
too powerful but skilled,&quot; Tom said, &quot;when she came to
the attention of the Lady Diana. She made some kind of
deal to have Jess&#39; help exclusively and kept her on
for two years, until they had a falling out.&quot;

&quot;Wonder how she got clear of the Lady?&quot; Lucy mused.

&quot;There&#39;s a couple different stories on the street,&quot;
Rose took up the story, &quot;but they all have some
elements in common. Apparently Diana asked Jess to do
something so repugnant that she balked, and was
brutally punished by the Lady. Jess struck back at the
Lady, how no one&#39;s quite sure, but whatever it was
scared the Lady badly enough that she leaves Drake
alone.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Lucy murmured.

&quot;For the next few months Jess goes on a legendary
drinling spree,&quot; Tom said with some amusement,
&quot;busting up bars and picking fights. She even ended up
painting a mural at the Daughters of Artemis when she
couldn&#39;t pay up for the damages.&quot;

&quot;She did the archer painting?&quot; Rose blinked in
surprise, having not heard that story before. &quot;She
must be a good artist...&quot;

&quot;It was sometime after that period that she first went
back to tattooing, first in a shop with another artist
the in her own business,&quot; Tom continued. &quot;She also
begins what I&#39;d call her crusader phase, working over
the last two years to drive organized crime out of her
area as well as protecting the citizens from any kinds
of supernatural badness,&quot; he said.

&quot;And her personal life?&quot; Lucy asked thoughtfully.

&quot;Drake was a bit of a cad,&quot; Rose said to them
honestly, &quot;I&#39;ve talked with more than one of her
one-night stands, and she often didn&#39;t even call them
back or anything else.&quot; She frowned in memory, &quot;Jess
didn&#39;t seem to favor a certain type, either, she&#39;s
dated people in both the butch and femme end of the
spectrum. However, that mostly stopped a few months
ago.&quot;

&quot;About the time she started to see Ms. Sinclaire?&quot;
Lucy asked and Rose nodded.

&quot;The only other woman Jess saw during that time was
Elizabeth,&quot; Rose fished a photo of the blonde from the
report and passed it over, &quot;and that was on an
irregular basis.&quot; Delicately she continued, &quot;It seems
she was seeing her purely for the sake of erotic
relief.&quot;

Lucy flipped through the papers, nodding to herself
thoughtfully. &quot;I think this&#39;ll do for a preliminary
report to Ms. Sinclaire, but I still wish we had more
of her past....&quot;

The bell out in the office rang, announcing that
someone had come inside. &quot;I thought I locked that,&quot;
Tom hopped to his feet, &quot;I&#39;ll get it.&quot; He hurried out
into the front office as he put his best
&#39;professional&#39; face on. &quot;Welcome to Yamazaki
Investigations, how can I....&quot; he trailed off in
surprise.

&quot;I understand you&#39;ve been asking about me?&quot; Jess Drake
asked him casually, standing there dressed in her
usual jeans and t-shirt.

&quot;Uh, boss?&quot; Tom called, looking nervously at the woman
they had been following.

Lucy Yamasaki and Rose strode out off the inner
office, even as Drake looked at them with a thoughtful
look. &quot;So,&quot; Jess said coldly, &quot;why were you following
me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lucy said calmly, &quot;I can&#39;t name my
client.&quot;

Drake smiled back, studying the three of them, &quot;Why
did I know you were going to say that?&quot;</pre>
