Slash Four: Feelings 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The castle gardens of Katsubana-jo were really quite lovely. In the 
spring and summer, the flowers blossomed rather well. To form mixes of 
colours that spoke heavily about the extravagance of their owner. Around 
the precinct of those gardens, towards the back of the castle, there was 
a layer of pathways. Each one no wider than a metre. They cut through 
the sections of the garden like a road. Each section holding a different 
flower or tree. Some holding sumire, some holding cherry blossoms, some 
even holding roses grown from seeds that were imported from the West 
more than 300 years ago. Both white and red. The rose sections of the 
gardens were apart from each other by one of those interlocking 
pathways. And to pass them by, if you had understanding of Nippon&#39;s 
ever-present worries, would suggest the true nature of the nation&#39;s 
position against the world. Isolation. Divided by seas and waters 
stretching over miles. 

The white rose of the West and the red rose of Nippon. 

How long could the two be kept apart?

It was something Minagawa Ryouichi had spent many times in his life 
thinking about And was quite a topic for the big-wigs in Edo. The 
problem of the west was never really off the agenda. The British Empire, 
the Dutch, the Spanish, the United States; they were always pushing for 
the opening of Japanese ports and for better trade relations. The 
&#39;Southern Barbarians&#39; as people called them, struck the upper classes 
(or at least those with the sense to know that they should be worried 
about the west) as no more than greedy interlopers with expansion on 
their minds. It was the will of the people to prevent the west from 
interfering with Nippon, even if national pride had to be re-invoked by 
clamouring to the flag of the emperor. 

Ryouichi kneeled down, observing the red roses with his devious eyes 
fixed in place. &quot;The nation born of the goddess of the sun. From the 
heavens came the ruler. A third descendant to him born, Nippon&#39;s beloved 
forefather, Jimmu In this day and age... the offspring of Jimmu are 
nothing more than puppets The will of Heian-kyo falling to that of the 
Bakufu so many years ago. Is this Amaterasu&#39;s revenge, I wonder? The 
nation usurped from its proper authority now at risk once again from the 
ambitions of the foreigner? That is something we shall never know.&quot;

&quot;Stop your daydreaming!&quot;

Ryouichi&#39;s cocky smile turned into a focused frown when he heard a 
familiar yell from behind him. As well as the sound of naked swords. The 
Gun Murderer stood up from his crouched position, taking one last sniff 
of the roses in the gardens. He then turned around and faced what he 
knew he heard. Behind him was once of the retainers of Satou&#39;s court. 
And behind that man were four of the retainer&#39;s personal guards. Each 
one holding an unsheathed katana and each one casting Ryouichi glances 
of hatred and disgust. Ryouichi once again smirked, dropping his head 
with a chuckle. 

But the retainer was not in a mood for laughter. &quot;You dare to laugh? Do 
you not understand what will happen here? I&#39;ve watched you leech off 
this court for far too long! If Lord Satou will not do away with you by 
his own will, then I shall do so myself!&quot;

Ryouichi continued to chuckle, until, &quot;Is that right? Tell me, is this 
it? Is this the grand force to bring about my demise? Think again, old 
man. I am Minagawa Ryouichi The Teppo Satsujin-hannin. It will take far 
more than this to kill the likes of me. But don&#39;t take my word for it. 
I&#39;ve always been a firm believer in the ideal that states...&quot;

The Gun Murder swiftly withdrew the long steel of his nodachi from its 
sheath, whilst claiming, &quot;it is better to FEEL than it is to THINK!&quot;

There was a savage, almost voracious burst of momentum in that instant. 
Ryouichi rushed forwards with the free Izata in a rapid, blurry dash. 
One so fast that the retainer and his warriors could barely see it. The 
ruthless sound of steel cutting through air and then on to flesh and 
bone was heard. When everyone finally adjusted to what was going on, the 
head of one of the bushi was already airborne. The decapitated body of 
the samurai collapsed to the ground with a splurge of blood over the 
stone of the garden pathways, splattering over the white and red roses 
alike. The image of Ryouichi blurred back into vision across from the 
retainer and his other four soldiers. Shared looks of fear were now 
prevalent in all but the retainer. But Ryouichi would show them no mercy 
either. The young man shut his eyes and focused his power into his long 
blade, its bloody tip touching the stone of the path. Two of the bushi 
ran forwards to attack, thinking the green-haired one to be out of 
breath. Then seconds later Ryouichi&#39;s eyes flashed open once more. He 
lifted Izata high into the air above him and then cried out with a 
fierce bellow The sword was slashed downwards. With such strength and 
speed that a transparent ripple of razor-shape force was thrust through 
the air at the two attacking men It was too late for either of them to 
do anything about it. They both screeched death cries when the Wind 
Blade Slash technique sliced through their bodies, chopping up their 
ribcages, dicing their internal organs and out through their backs. 
Blood exploded from their torsos while they both dropped dead. Ryouichi 
ignored their fates and vaulted into the air. His form vanished into a 
blur again, using even more of that superhuman speed of his. Then his 
body blurred back into vision directly above the last bushi. Ryouichi 
yelled out another battle cry, pulling back the sword and then slashing 
downwards. The blade of Izata hacked right through the torso of the 
samurai. Through the bone of the cranium, the tissue of the brain, the 
bone of the nose, the roof of the mouth, through the windpipe, down the 
outline of the ribcage, through the internal organs then directly 
through the crotch -- ultimately through the penis and scrotum. By the 
time that Ryouichi&#39;s sandals touched the ground again, that last 
swordsman&#39;s body was cut into two even halves that toppled to either 
side of Izata with waves of blood spraying around the path. The sallow, 
grim colours of the man&#39;s organs became clear. His entire internal 
make-up was now spread across the path itself. His liver, heart, 
intestinal tracks, bladder, kidneys, lungs; all of it dropped out of the 
two halved sections of the corpse, a metre-wide pool of blood forming 
beneath all of it. Ryouichi had murdered all of the retainer&#39;s men in 
little under seven and half seconds. And yet he hadn&#39;t even broken a 
sweat. 

The retainer was left shaking in fear, while the wafting, wet smell of 
blood surrounded the immediate area. &quot;You&#39;re... not... human...&quot;

Ryouichi&#39;s shoulders bobbed up and down as he laughed dryly. With one 
strong jerk he twirled Izata around, swinging off the scraps of bone, 
blood and muscle. He then sheathed it and turned around to gaze at the 
retainer. 

&quot;I&#39;m very human, actually. But unlike you... I am not a weakling&quot;

The older man stepped back in fear. &quot;...I...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Replied Ryouichi, &quot;Do you feel like begging for your life now? 
Do you feel like throwing yourself at my feet?! Well you can calm 
yourself I&#39;m not going to murder you. That would incriminate me. And I 
still have something I must do before I can say goodbye to Natsumura. 
Your life is safe for now. So be gone. I&#39;ve no use for weaklings.&quot;

The retainer stepped away and made his escape, startled by Ryouichi&#39;s 
slaughtering of his men. The Gun Murderer simply scoffed at him and 
turned his back. Kneeling down once more to admire the roses. Yet when 
the pathways around him were stained with the blood and intestines of 
his victims, such an act came with a far more sinister light to it. This 
was the world of the Teppo Satsujin-hannin.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Nanase looked up when she heard the distinct sound of her sliding door 
being opened. Just as she had thought, it was Hinata. The samurai woman 
waltzed up from the murmurs of the streets outside and slid the door 
closed once more to block it all out. But both Hinata and Nanase now 
knew what those murmurs were being caused by. Lord Satou&#39;s new laws. 
They had the whole town on edge. Earlier on, Nanase had left to get some 
water from the local well. In doing so she saw the stage with the lord&#39;s 
edict on it. And she also saw the anger on the faces of those who would 
have to suffer those laws.

It was not the first time that someone had passed a radical change in 
law in this domain. But from Lord Satou it seemed to have a particularly 
foul smell to it. All these laws catered to his better needs. A new tax 
would provide him with more money A curfew would keep the people in 
check after nightfall, securing the streets. And most importantly, no 
one could complain about it now. Leaving Natsumura was forbidden. And 
smuggling messages via trade would be equally difficult. It seemed that 
Satou wanted to enforce a new stranglehold of strength over the han. But 
what could the people do about it? 

Hinata exhaled softly and took a seat by the central table of the living 
area. Just across from Nanase. Who felt herself becoming awkward again 
when her friend was in the room, blushing and chewing on her tongue. 
Once Hinata settled, she addressed the other girl, saying,

&quot;Have you heard?&quot;

Nanase nodded. &quot;Yes. Lord Satou has passed new laws. Restricting 
movement. I don&#39;t know how well those villagers are taking it, but, I 
know that the rest of Natsumura&#39;s people will be horrified when they 
learn of them.&quot;

Hinata bobbed her head in agreement. The farmers of Natsumura already 
seemed to have their hands full with work on the fields. These new laws 
would greatly reduce the little freedoms they already had. While a 
person could be subject to suspicion if leaving their village for no 
apparent reason, banning the right to leave entirely was drastic Very 
much so. And Hinata couldn&#39;t help but feel responsible for it. From the 
reaction of the townsfolk, Satou&#39;s actions came as a shock. Which showed 
to Hinata, conclusively, that this was not a regular pattern. Such 
stringent laws being passed just as Hinata had arrived seemed to say 
much of her involvement If Hinata had never come here, would the good 
people of Natsumura, like Nanase, have ever had to put up with this? She 
had thought that she did the right thing when she saved Takahiro from 
those samurai from Katsubana-jo. But was it really the right thing? How 
could it be so if it triggered off something like this?

Was Hinata destined to cause misery wherever she went?

The plum-eyed swordsman looked downwards at her lap with a guilty, 
frustrated expression One that Nanase eventually caught on to. Even she 
could see that Hinata was blaming herself for what Satou was doing. But 
all the same, she didn&#39;t see it that way.

Nanase clutched her hands together, looking away. &quot;Miss Shinmyouji?&quot;

&quot;...Yes?&quot;

&quot;Why did you decide to stay?&quot; Nanase asked, cheeks fiery, &quot;I mean, in 
Natsumura. Why did you want to stay here? Someone of your skill could 
leave this place behind and never look back. And Lord Satou is not the 
best of rulers. So why?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re asking me why I stayed?&quot; Hinata asked for clarity.

&quot;Uh huh.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Hinata answered, &quot;in meeting with that shinobi woman, 
that Asakura Riki, it became clear to me that there was more going on in 
Natsumura than I was aware of. Perhaps that is why I remain. Or perhaps 
I&#39;m attracted to the sleepy life of this town, so much alike with my 
place of birth. Or maybe I remain to protect you from harm. Who can say? 
I&#39;ve certainly never understood the way my own mind thinks.&quot;

Nanase found herself smiling. &quot;You want to protect me?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve shown me great kindness. I couldn&#39;t rightly ignore that. Not 
even if I wanted to. The Circle of One states that kindness from a 
person must be repaid in kind with an equal kindness. Protecting you 
from harm is the only way I can see to repay you.&quot;

Well Nanase didn&#39;t think that she needed to be repaid in any way, but 
what she did do was dwell on a certain comment that Hinata made. That 
was, &quot;...Circle of One?&quot;

&quot;Yes. The philosophy of my people. The Ennoichi Clan. It states that 
life is a periodical shift between four stages. Like a cycle. And those 
stages begin afresh when we bear children. Those who adhere to the 
Circle of One must also adhere to its laws. Something that both my 
mother and Kanae were very strict about. Hmph. I suppose my fate was 
quite ironic, then. It&#39;s strange how love can confuse matters.&quot;

Nanase fiddled with her fingers. Again Hinata brought up comment of this 
&#39;Kanae&#39; woman. The village girl didn&#39;t even know the full extent of the 
connection between Hinata and Kanae, and yet she already felt jealous of 
it. 

And yet she was dead. 

Nanase actually found herself in envy of the dead. &quot;That woman. Kanae. 
You speak very highly of her. I don&#39;t know many people who would show so 
much devotion to a teacher.&quot;

&quot;She wasn&#39;t just my teacher,&quot; Hinata corrected, looking up, &quot;she was far 
more than that. Far more...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Why not try a ten-stroke symbol, this time?&quot;

It was summer. 

The heat gathering around Akaitaiyo-shima was immense. Much hotter than 
usual. It came during a period when many things were taking place. The 
77th Asuka, leader of the Ennoichi Clan, was preparing to go on a trip 
to the mainland to survey what was becoming of it. It was a tradition of 
the leader to leave the isolated island at least once a year to catch up 
on the goings on of Nippon. That would occur in two days time. While the 
77th Asuka was away, the would-be 78th Asuka, &#39;Hinata&#39;, would be 
maintaining her studies for leadership There would soon a festival 
hosted for the 77th Asuka, to wish her good luck for the trip. That 
would happen later on in the night. Most of the townsfolk would be 
watching it. But for now, preparations had to be made. 

Hinata sat, scoffing, with her fingers running a wet sumi block over a 
tray of water to create ink for her calligraphy lessons. It was 
essential that an Asuka know how to write well, but this lesson just 
felt so annoying to her. Hinata had actually found herself lusting after 
the rigours of Genryu&#39;s training rather than writing with a paint brush. 
The only thing that made the studies of calligraphy bearable was the 
fact that Kanae was teaching it today. Normally the one to instruct 
Hinata in calligraphy was Kadama Ogawa. But since he was off making 
things ready for her mother&#39;s send-off, Hinata was blessed with the 
instructing hand of Kanae. The brown-haired swordswoman-in-training sat 
at a wooden table with her legs folded under her. She placed the sumi 
block down on a compartment of the water tray, and took out a piece of 
paper. With one hand she dipped the tip of her paint brush into her 
water/ink tray and wrote down the ten-stroke symbol of &#39;toku&#39; 
(advantage). Shortly behind her was Mitomi Kanae herself. Thanks to the 
hot weather she was wearing a sleeveless kimono today. Eventually she 
peered over Hinata&#39;s shoulder to see how she was getting on. The girl 
had done the symbol as asked of her, but in a sloppy, tired way. The 
strokes were overly curved and smudged. Though she knew that Hinata 
wasn&#39;t very good in the calligraphy art, it was something she had to 
perfect before she became the next leader of the Ennoichi Clan. 

&quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; Hinata asked of her teacher, half-expectant (for Kanae&#39;s 
sake) and half-indifferent (for her own). 

Kanae wriggled her nose. &quot;...You are getting there. But you still have a 
few... problems.&quot;

&quot;Such as?&quot;

It was better to help out the girl than instruct her lifelessly, 
especially in this heat. Kanae leaned over Hinata fully, so much so that 
the two were brought close together. The teacher&#39;s head settled just at 
the frame of her pupil&#39;s left shoulder, which, much to Hinata&#39;s pleasure 
and frustration, pressed Kanae&#39;s large breasts against her back. The 
young woman went red in the face, far more so than usual, feeling the 
tips of her love&#39;s nipples pressing against her back through the thin 
fabric of their kimonos. It caused an effect on Hinata that was 
unnoticed by Kanae, who simply grabbed Hinata&#39;s hand (the one holding 
the brush) while her other hand grabbed a new piece of paper She placed 
the square paper sheet over the used one and guided Hinata&#39;s writing 
hand over to it.

&quot;Now,&quot; Kanae whispered into her ear, &quot;try again. Keep your fingers firm 
around the shaft of the brush. And even out your palm a little more Then 
begin, using lighter strokes, carefully moving the brush so the tip of 
the bristles flatten out slightly during the process.&quot;

Hinata, who was struggling even to hear what her teacher was saying, 
somehow managed to catch onto that and she changed her approach based on 
what Kanae had said. Soon afterwards she flicked at the paper in ten new 
strokes, creating the same symbol, toku, but with far greater finesse. 

Kanae smiled at the result. &quot;There, you see? It looks wonderful.&quot;

The compliments she was receiving through her ear were heard but not 
quite understood at the time. Hinata&#39;s throat quivered roughly from 
feeling Kanae&#39;s cool tree-leaf breath playfully lingering on her ear. 
That, along with the sensation of having Kanae&#39;s breasts against her 
back, brought Hinata to a place she hadn&#39;t gone to in a while. Lust. The 
pounding of her heart, the butterfly-fluttering of her stomach, was now 
accompanied by a growing wetness between her legs. The plum-eyed girl 
gulped hard and tried to keep her mind on the lesson. In so doing;

&quot;T-thank you,&quot; Hinata said, &quot;...you&#39;ve always known what to do.&quot;

Kanae then pulled away from Hinata&#39;s back and shoulder, eliciting a sigh 
of regret from the younger female. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly. You know what to do. 
You just need a guiding hand sometimes, Asuka. And I know that you don&#39;t 
like this lesson, but you must keep at it. One day it will all be over. 
And you won&#39;t need me to teach you anything. You&#39;ll have learnt it all 
yourself.&quot;

That was the one prospect that Hinata couldn&#39;t face. Entering a stage of 
her life when Kanae no longer needed to be there. The younger girl was 
not looking forward to it. In fact, these days, it almost broke her 
heart every time she was separated from Kanae. Even if it was only for a 
few minutes. Hinata tightened up, putting down the brush and pressing 
her palms into her kimono-covered lap. 

&quot;I don&#39;t want that.&quot;

Kanae blinked. &quot;You don&#39;t want what?&quot;

&quot;To be,&quot; Hinata tried acclimate herself, &quot;so trained that... I don&#39;t 
need you anymore. It&#39;s not true. I need you. I need you a lot...&quot;

The older woman smiled generously at her pupil. &quot;Maybe now you feel that 
way But that&#39;s because you haven&#39;t learned to rely on your own talents 
yet. Once you come of age and become leader, then you&#39;ll-&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Hinata shook her head from side to side, &quot;that&#39;s not what I mean! 
You&#39;re so wonderful and intelligent and pretty and dignified and... what 
I want to say is... what I mean is...&quot; 

Now it became clear that Hinata was actually trying to tell her 
something. Kanae&#39;s head tilted to one side with a look of concern, and 
she shifted next to Hinata in the seiza, observing her. &quot;Hey... what&#39;s 
wrong, Asuka? Did I upset you somehow? If I did then I apologize.&quot;

Hinata then shook her head again, this time a little slower than before, 
to indicate a no. And it was then that Kanae noticed a tear drip down 
from the corner of Hinata&#39;s eye. Something was upsetting her, that was 
for sure. But what?

&quot;Asuka,&quot; Kanae began, &quot;if something is on your mind, then please feel 
free to tell me about it. Remember what we agreed? You shall be my rock 
and I will be yours.&quot;

How could she say anything? Hinata softened when she felt Kanae wrap an 
arm around her shoulder as comfort. But still she was so afraid of what 
Kanae&#39;s reaction would be. How could you walk up to your teacher and 
wildly profess your love without warning? Hinata turned her head around. 
Ever so slowly and slightly. Until she and Kanae were eye-to-eye with 
each other. It was at that point that something odd happened. The two 
only looked at each other. Hinata gazing into Kanae&#39;s strong, dark eyes, 
and Kanae probing Hinata&#39;s tearful purple ones. They just stared quietly 
at each other for a few moments. One studying beauty, the other looking 
for answers. Until the point came at which Kanae&#39;s eyes widened It was 
the look of realization. Hinata&#39;s nervous smile made its return, as a 
new tear slid down her cheek from an eye. The look in her teacher&#39;s eyes 
said it all. She knew. Kanae knew about her feelings. And it had taken 
only one slip-up of emotion to undo everything she had done to hide her 
feelings for the past two years. 

Perhaps that was why it took her sometime to adjust to the fact that 
someone was kissing her moments later. 

For an instant, things went black in Hinata&#39;s head. Then a split second 
later, the situation was completely different. Her back was on the 
ground. She could feel someone&#39;s thigh pressing between her legs and 
prising apart her hips Causing her wetness to seep through the silk 
fabric of her undergarments. Hinata could now feel someone&#39;s lips 
against her own. Someone else&#39;s breath mingling with her own, someone 
else&#39;s ever so elongated tongue gliding over her teeth. In the three and 
half seconds it took to register what was happening, Hinata opened her 
eyes and saw, with tremendous shook, a lust-ridden Kanae mounted over 
her, partaking of the only kiss that Hinata had ever experienced in her 
life. It was quite frankly the most startling and desired moment that 
the Ennoichi successor could have hoped for. Kanae was kissing her. No 
peck on the cheek, no goodbye kiss. It was the kind of kiss exchanged 
between lovers. And to know that it was Kanae that was kissing her; was 
a shock that paralysed Hinata. So much so that she could barely bring 
herself to respond. Only feel and enjoy. Feel Kanae&#39;s gentle warmth over 
her. Enjoy Kanae&#39;s light moans of pleasure. Feel the cerise softness of 
Kanae&#39;s lips against her own. Enjoy the light stroke of the older 
woman&#39;s thigh between her hips; up and down, down and up. It was more 
intense than Hinata could ever have pictured it. And yet it lasted for 
only a short few seconds. 

Before Hinata could even settle into Kanae&#39;s kiss, the teacher broke it, 
shaking her head violently. She stood up swiftly, mouthing &#39;Kami-sama, 
what am I doing?&#39; to herself, smoothing out the length of her kimono, 
which, as it happens, was now stained with traces of Hinata&#39;s premature 
discharge in a wet patch. Hinata caught her breath, still addled, just 
arising as Kanae turned her back on her.

&quot;...K-Kanae...?&quot;

The dark-haired beauty pressed her forehead into her palm. &quot;No. I 
shouldn&#39;t have done that. I shouldn&#39;t have done that. I shouldn&#39;t have 
done that.&quot;

&quot;Kanae, please...&quot; Hinata tried to reach out to her, &quot;do you feel the 
same way as I do?&quot;

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t have done that.&quot;

&quot;J-just answer me!&quot; Hinata yelled shakily, some of her haughty Asuka 
dominance becoming apparent. 

&quot;...Asuka,&quot; Kanae&#39;s arms shook, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Hinata pressed the palm of her hand against Kanae&#39;s back, stroking her 
fingers up and down, suddenly finding the courage to express herself 
properly. &quot;...I&#39;m not. I love you. I&#39;ve loved you ever since I started 
bleeding with the moon. I think about you all the time. When I wake, 
when I eat, when I train, when I bathe, even when I dream. I don&#39;t want 
to live a day without you in my life. I love you, Kanae.&quot;

Kanae visibly shook, her back still turned. &quot;Asuka... this is insane. 
You&#39;ve only just turned eighteen. I&#39;m twenty-seven years old. I&#39;m nine 
years your senior. Your engagement to that Nobutami boy is already being 
arranged. And what of our code? You know that Circle of One forbids...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care!&quot; Hinata cried, wrapping her arms around the waist of her 
love, &quot;I don&#39;t care if our laws say that it&#39;s wrong! All I want is to be 
with you! I don&#39;t care about being a bushi, I don&#39;t care about the 
Ennoichi Clan! I just want us to be together! That&#39;s all I want!&quot;

Hinata then burst into tears, sobbing against the back of Kanae&#39;s loose 
white kimono. Never before had Kanae heard such an outburst from the 
younger woman. Hinata was true in all that she said. She was in love. 
This was not the childish crush of two-years ago, this was something 
real. A true love, forbidden but not unrequited Kanae weighed this all 
in her mind. She could feel Hinata crying into the gap between her 
shoulder blades as they stood together. And she knew that this was wrong 
That two women of Akaitaiyo-shima could not be together. But she 
couldn&#39;t deny what she was feeling. Hinata was no longer the little girl 
staring at the sea. She was a woman. Old enough and mature enough to 
know what she wanted out of life. What she wanted was Kanae. The older 
woman sighed, then turned around, keeping Hinata&#39;s arms firm and secure 
around her waist. They came to be face to face again, tear tracks 
already staining the cheeks under Hinata&#39;s eyes. Kanae smiled warmly and 
stroked those cheeks with the back of her index finger, bringing a new 
smile to the swordswoman&#39;s face.

&quot;You&#39;re a very emotional girl,&quot; Kanae commented, &quot;some people think of 
that as a weakness.&quot;

Hinata blushed, smiling. &quot;Is that really what you... want to say to me?&quot;

&quot;Maybe not,&quot; Kanae commented, lowering her face to Hinata&#39;s, &quot;maybe I 
just want...&quot;

The future successor of the Ennoichi Clan shut her eyes and pursed her 
lips, awaiting that same thing she had wanted for so long. The lips of 
the two closed in on each other, to gain that second kiss. Until the 
opposing door was slid open. Both Hinata and Kanae froze. Then they 
looked back at the open door. To see Hinata&#39;s ageing mother, the 77th 
Asuka, staring dumbfounded at the pair of them

The older Asuka was knocked for six. &quot;W-what in name of Kami-sama...?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Nanase was stunned by what Hinata had told her. The feeling between her 
and Kanae were not just platonic. They loved each other. Hinata loved 
this woman. And from what the swordswoman had told her, her mother had 
caught them just as they were about to express their love again. 

Nanase sat apart from Hinata by only a short distance. So she could see 
the tremendous weight that those memories had on the older girl. Hinata 
had been struggling with these recollections. And it explained a lot 
about her current personality. Hinata was a bubbly, bright girl back 
then. Now she was passionless and emotionally vacant Almost devoid of 
life and spirit. A result of her feelings for Kanae. From what Hinata 
had said, and from the very fact that Kanae was dead, Nanase could tell 
that her friend&#39;s story did not have a happy ending. Yet all Nanase 
wanted to do was comfort her. The villager shifted closer to Hinata, who 
was already distracted by what she recalled from her past. The samurai 
only realized that Nanase had slid closer to her when she noticed 
Nanase&#39;s hand placed warmly on her knee

&quot;...Nanase?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for what you went through,&quot; Admitted the girl, &quot;I know that 
it must have been hard for you. But you don&#39;t have to be alone forever. 
I could... take the place of Miss Mitomi...&quot;

Then things fell silent for a poignant fourteen seconds. Hinata remained 
perfectly still as Nanase leaned into her, partly closing her eyes. For 
just a tiny moment Nanase possessed the strength she needed to do this. 
To kiss her &#39;Miss Shinmyouji&#39;. And just as their lips were about 
connect... 

&quot;Stop.&quot;

Nanase opened her eyes fully, startled. Hinata had told her to stop. The 
swordswoman looked on at the villager from Natsumura with those same 
cold, lifeless eyes. 

&quot;I never want to be in that position again, Nanase,&quot; She said, &quot;you 
could never take her place. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Nanase&#39;s startled look became a sad smile. Hinata turned away, unable to 
look at it. The last thing she wanted to do was to hurt Nanase. But she 
couldn&#39;t betray her feelings for Kanae now, either. She then stood up 
and walked over to the door. She slid it open, walked outside, then slid 
it closed again. Leaving Nanase alone to contemplate her actions. She 
bit her lip and tried to suppress a sob, eyes watering. 

There was no room in Hinata&#39;s heart for anyone else. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The following day had finally come. When the sun arose for the next 
morning, the plan began. Takahiro, Hayate and Masahito got up on 
horseback, then rushed to the very edges of the han along the dirt 
tracks of Shirokawa Pass. They split off on the edge of road leading 
from Natsumura Village. Takahiro&#39;s horse galloped to the north. While 
Hayate and Masahito&#39;s horses rushed to the southwest By the time they 
all reached their destinations, the groups who had pledged their support 
for Hayate&#39;s rebellion were already waiting. 467 able-bodied, 
sword-armed men from the Satsuma domain in the southwest, and 323 men to 
the north from the Higo region. They had all come, pledged samurai and 
ronin alike. All of them rubbing shoulders together, breaking through 
society&#39;s stigma to join in the fight against tyranny. Once things had 
been settled, like pay and duty, Masahito and Hayate led the Satsuma 
troops back up Shirokawa Pass. While Takahiro led the Higo troops down 
from the north of the pass to meet with Hayate and Masahito&#39;s group at 
the Natsumura Junction of the Pass. With the group fully gathered 
together, they marched from the Natsumura Junction to the east of 
Shirokawa Pass This was not the way towards the village. It was the way 
towards Katsubana-jo. Through the forests of the east was the wide and 
imposing layout known as Ichigateki Shrine. An ancient Shinto structure 
that had been built many years ago after the death of Oda Nobunaga, a 
sort of testament to the local&#39;s appreciation of his work against 
Buddhism. Of course, he was considered to be the first of the Tokugawa 
powerhouses, so southern support of this nature was a fleeting thing. 
The loud clapping of hooves of the horses of Hayate, Takahiro, and 
Masahito ended when they rode up to the stone clearing of the shrine. 
Hayate pulled on his reins and came to a stop. By the time he and his 
788 men were here, Hiroko and her troops were already ready to go. All 
30 of them, masters in the art of rifle-handling. Hiroko stood with 
them, her Naginata unwrapped and her body fully decked out in female 
battle gear befitting a former miko - red hakama and all. 

Masahito and Takahiro also dismounted, their horses tended to by one of 
the smaller boys amongst the group. They then marched behind Hayate into 
the shrine&#39;s main hall, across the wide expanse of that cobblestone 
courtyard. Hiroko joined them, as did a few of the more significant 
members of the Higo/Satsuma troops. Then a lot of the other men joined 
them. Until the entire hall was packed with as many men as it could 
possibly contain. This would be Hayate&#39;s final speech before the attack 
on Katsubana-jo. The hey-haired samurai walked up to a slight rise of 
wood that acted as a platform, and looked out unto the hundreds of men 
who had come together in the name of his cause. This was what he wanted. 
Individuals standing as one in the face of darkness, allied in their 
desire to see a new future for Nippon.

&quot;We have all gathered together,&quot; Hayate said, raising his voice to be 
heard by all who could, &quot;in defiance of a man who has abused his 
position as a leader. Some of you may have other reasons. Be they money, 
honour, or restoration But what we ALL feel is clear! A hatred of the 
corrupt nature of the Bakufu! For far too long we have had to watch our 
many brothers and sisters suffer in famine and poverty for the 
dishonourable men in Edo! We have had to watch as they feed themselves 
off the suffering of our peers and we have been forced to watch as they 
sacrifice the futures of our people by ignoring the power of the west. 
Well no more! We must unite and summon up the strength of will blessed 
upon us by our hearts and our swords! The Tokugawa must fall! And the 
destruction of both Katsubana-jo and Satou are the first step of that 
attainable dream! Consider this NOT to be your time to stop a tyrant. 
Consider this to be the beginning of the salvation of all Nippon! Dream 
not for a better present, but rather a greater tomorrow! And years from 
now your grandchildren will be able to look upon you with pride, and 
know, implicitly, that he or she belongs to the bloodline of a man who 
gave them not just freedom, not just life, not just money, but the one 
thing that all men, rich or poor, tall or small, deserve! And that one 
thing, that ONE thing, is our honour!&quot;

The whole crowds of men burst out with unanimous cheer, raising their 
sheathed swords into the air and proclaiming Kagami Hayate with the 
respect that he was able to conjure from almost all that he met. Amongst 
those men was Takahiro, who fully agreed with Hayate&#39;s dream of a new 
tomorrow, his zeal almost transcending that of the crowds around him. 
Masahito smiled at his master, proud of his ability to rouse this group 
into action as one. While Hiroko (who stood at the side wall with her 
arms crossed) just shut her eyes with a grin. Hayate had an amazing 
ability to charm and rally people to his cause. But it was a cause that 
they all believed in. Something that they were prepared to lay their 
lives for, something that would start with the destruction of Lord 
Satou. 

The overthrowing of the Tokugawa Shogunate. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

South east of Dairyu Port, along the shores of Natsumura, there was a 
large, secluded cave. The waves of the sea crashing into the beaches 
could be heard loudly from them. Overhanging the cliff face that the 
cave had been carved into was the highway road leading into the west 
towards the village. That, and the fact that this area was close to 
Dairyu Port, made this a common place for the more underhanded dealings 
of the village in the past. Now no one used it for those purposes 
anymore. Aside from one person. That person was Satou Genpachiro.

The large cave was now packed with many wooden barrels that had been 
stacked together in certain space. Two bushi from Katsubana-jo stood 
watch of the barrels, marching up and down and speaking to each other. 
But, unbeknownst to them, they were not alone. A shadow crouched behind 
one of the barrels to keep out of sight. 

Riki 

The kunoichi peered around the barrel she was behind and listened in to 
the conversation that the two samurai were having. One of them yawned 
aloud and said, &quot;Damn. This is boring. I wish I were at the castle.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The other one asked, &quot;And have to put up with that crazy 
Minagawa bastard?&quot;

Riki&#39;s eyes widened, whispering to herself as she listened. 
&quot;...Minagawa?! So he really IS here... our intelligence wasn&#39;t 
incorrect...&quot;

If she and the two bushi were thinking of the same person, it meant that 
there was a whole new issue to deal with in Natsumura. But she tried not 
to complicate this any more and assumed that they were not talking about 
Minagawa Ryouichi. The first warrior replied to the second with,

&quot;Yeah well, it&#39;s better than this! I heard last night that the three 
guards stationed at Dairyu went missing! I thought that we might get 
some action because of that, but, we aren&#39;t lucky enough.&quot;

The second man scratched his beard. &quot;You won&#39;t have to put up with it 
much longer. Once Lord Satou sells this load then we won&#39;t be on guard 
duty here for another year. How&#39;s that sound?&quot;

&quot;Not bad. As long as I can get a share of the profits!&quot;

The two men chuckled at that, while Riki thought this over from her 
position. She then crawled over to another barrel and silently lifted 
the lid. When she peered inside, she was more than startled to see rice. 
And judging by the number of barrels here, there was over 5700 koku. But 
this year&#39;s harvests were over. And the annual evaluation given of them 
had already been sent to Edo. This could not have been part of the main 
harvest, if it were then why would they keep it in this dank cave? Now, 
Riki was now beginning to understand what Satou had done. The evidence 
was completely clear.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Riki mused, &quot;...very clever, Satou...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Night had fallen on Katsubana-jo. 

As normal, the few guards stationed around the footpath curling around 
the precinct of the castle left their jobs with idle hands. Holding 
their positions until they were later allowed to retreat to the warmth 
of their quarters. A number of twenty guards marched around the outline 
of the castle walls as lookouts for trouble in the night. But had they 
been doing their job a little better, they would have noticed the bright 
colours of fabric in the grass of the surrounding forests. Secluded in 
the tall bushes of the woodland were the insurrectionists of Lord 
Satou&#39;s rule. The armed men and women of Hayate&#39;s army. 

Deep in the grass Hayate crouched down with hundreds of men behind him 
in the exact same position. Beside him was his closest friend, Kubo 
Masahito, fully dressed in his battle armour. Shortly in front of Hayate 
and Masahito were the frontal troops of his army. The gunmen. They 
waited for Hayate&#39;s command to attack. As did the fifteen archers to the 
right of him. 

Masahito&#39;s focused eyes were directed towards the walls of Katsubana-jo, 
more specifically the gates, but he aimed his words at Hayate. &quot;Should 
we attack now, sir? Hiroko and Takahiro&#39;s team are probably in position 
by now.&quot;

Hayate nodded, whispering, &quot;Right. Archers! Now!&quot;

The group of fifteen archers nodded in reply and took arrows from the 
quivers on their back. They pulled them back on the strings of their 
bows and lined them up at the wood. Then they all kneeled in unison. 
Before them were containers with burning wood inside them. The group 
pointed their drawn arrows into the fire to allow them to catch aflame. 
With that said and done, the group rose up with the flaming arrows 
Taking aim at the walls and keep of Katsubana-jo. Hayate raised his arm 
into the air as a signal for the first wave of fire arrows. He then 
swung the arm right back down. The fifteen archers released their arrows 
in a completely co-ordinated wave. Fifteen flaming arrows were shot into 
the air curling upwards and over, glowing in the darkness of the night. 
Some of the guards caught onto the sight of flashes of light from the 
wall patrol. But by then it was too late to do anything about it. The 
arrows staked into the keep and walls of the castle. The points they 
touched then quickly caught fire. Setting parts of the main wall and the 
castle keep alight The guards at the north wall became alert, looking 
around for the point of fire, yelling &#39;an attack!?&#39; or &#39;are we under 
assault?!&#39;. The fact was made very clear to them when Hayate nodded to 
the gun squad in the shadows of the grass. They all nodded back. Thirty 
of them. All lined up in rows of ten. The first ten had already stuffed 
their matchlocks with gunpowder and were ready for the attack. They all 
kneeled down in sync and aimed at the guards of the castle&#39;s north wall, 
who were patrolling for the source of the attack. They then all fired. 
Picket shots of force were propelled ahead right at the forward troops 
of the castle. They all cried out when they were shot, blasted in the 
chests and knees, throats and stomachs. Blood splashed everywhere. 
Across the walls of the castle and the dirt track grounds around them. 
The guards toppled over, falling to the ground. At least those at the 
front. 

The bushi at the east and west walls, heard the gunfire from the front 
of the castle They mobilized out of instinct, grabbing the hilts of 
their swords and rushing forwards to the north of the castle. Hayate 
signalled to the gunmen to prepare the second wave. The first ten men 
crouched to the ground and reloaded gunpowder, while the currently 
loaded second line stood up to fire from behind the first. When the 
bushi from the west and eastern walls joined again in the north, they 
all took aim and fired. The claps of gunfire rung out into the night and 
forests once more. The men at the front of Satou&#39;s guard were blown down 
in one go. The blood and scraps of bone blown from the bodies and faces 
thrown into the clothes of the other samurai. The 17 or so men that 
survived the attack now knew conclusively that there was an attack on 
the castle. But they didn&#39;t quite know the magnitude of it. 

One of them yelled, &quot;We&#39;re under attack!&quot; to the guards behind the 
castle wall, those who had also heard the gunfire. Those troops then 
passed word to those inside the castle itself. The yells of &#39;arm 
yourselves&#39; and &#39;we&#39;re under attack&#39; now became prevalent in the field. 
The burning of the fires caused by the flaming arrows was staring to 
spread across the precinct of the castle. From the north of the walls to 
the northeast of them. Smoke started to rise with embers into the dark 
skies above them. Those castle samurai who had come to inspect the 
ruckus caused at the front, joined the dead bodies of their compatriots 
as corpses. The third wave, the ten gunmen behind the second line, took 
aim and fired at the north wall once again. The remaining guards were 
shot down instantly before they even had time to withdraw their blades 
and charge the forests. As their bodies toppled over in blood and 
groaning, the sounds of the battle could be heard all the way from the 
back of the castle. The ten samurai stationed at the south wall were not 
moving from their posts, thinking that the others could handle it. But 
they had no idea that in the southern tip of the forests, Hiroko (with 
her Naginata at the ready) and Takahiro (fully armoured and carrying a 
katana) were lying in wait with their few hundred men crouched behind 
them in the high grass. They noted the sound gunfire and death cries 
lingering in the air from the north of Katsubana-jo&#39;s walls. Hiroko knew 
that to be her gun squad. And the fires around Katsubana-jo&#39;s northern 
walls were started by the flame archers. Hayate and Masahito had begun 
their part of the attack. Now it was time for her own part. 

Hiroko looked over to Takahiro (who still was not comfortable with the 
prospect of women fighters, but retained his ill sentiments within 
himself for the time being), &quot;Now?!&quot;

&quot;Now...&quot; Takahiro stood upright, unsheathing his blade, &quot;NOW!&quot;

The few castle samurai positioned at the south wall were dumbstruck when 
they heard the loud and intimidating chorus of yells from hundreds of 
disenfranchised men, along with the conjoined sounds of them undressing 
their thirsty blades. The whole group rose out of the high grass of the 
forests and yelled aloud with combined zeal, then charged at the 
southern wall. The ten men gasped with fright at the sight of hundreds 
of sweaty, bloodthirsty, Tokugawa-hating bushi charging in their way And 
they knew full well that this was their end. But they unsheathed anyway, 
bidding themselves to die in the name of honour and loyalty. Hiroko and 
Takahiro led the front of the charging southern half of Hayate&#39;s armies. 
Hiroko grinned deviously and jumped into the air, her hakama waving 
around her legs in the air, the blade of her polearm suddenly fixed 
itself with a sparkling and crackling golden energy. That of her Chi. An 
aura of gold encircled her Naginata (named as Chinosotsuke) and she 
descended at the men protecting the south wall, yelling,

&quot;Kubo Naginata-style! Falling Dragon Blade!&quot;

The roar of the dragon was heard with the crackle of Chi, as Hiroko&#39;s 
golden-forced weapon came slashing through the torso of one of the 
castle bushi. Her Naginata hacked into the man&#39;s shoulder, straight 
through the body until it chopped through chest and stomach in a curved 
slash. Both cutting and burning the warrior When the blade of the 
polearm bashed against the dirt ground with resistance, the upper-left 
half of the samurai fell from the rest of its body. His blood and guts 
spilling onto the ground. Hiroko caught her breath and stood up, her 
Naginata losing its golden glow. The nine other south-wall bushi were 
hacked to pieces by Takahiro and a few of the others. Finally swords 
began to clash, the trademarked sound of the battle, and Satou&#39;s lower 
men fought their ground. But out of posterity, not hope. Some of them 
managed to kill a couple of Hayate&#39;s second forces. But they were 
bitterly outnumbered. Takahiro came up to one, who incidentally happened 
to be related to the same castle warden that had tried to kill him days 
ago. Takahiro growled as his sword clashed with that of the bushi He 
then batted the other man&#39;s blade away and stabbed. The blade pierced 
right through the non-protective fabric of his kimono. Takahiro sneered 
at the other one, watching him gargle on his own blood. Then pulled his 
sword out of the man&#39;s body, letting him fall to the ground. By the time 
Takahiro had killed him, the other castle guards were dead. Bravely as 
they fought, they were simply swept away by the 360+ men at Hiroko and 
Takahiro&#39;s command. 

Some members of group then took grappling hooks of their arms. At least 
fifty men swung their grappling hooks around and around for momentum, 
then through them towards the castle walls. The ropes hooked onto the 
southern wall of the castle, securely Then Hayate&#39;s men started to climb 
up the robes to make their way over the castle walls. Takahiro and 
Hiroko oversaw the climbing of their troops. They scaled the walls with 
nothing other then revolution of their minds. Yells of &#39;the head of 
Satou&#39; and &#39;death to all Tokugawa&#39; were screamed from their throats in 
their anger. The first number of men to reach the top of the southern 
wall jumped down from the top to ground level, now in the precinct of 
the castle itself. They rushed forwards with angry cries to the bushi 
that lay in wait. While their allies threw up more grappling hooks and 
climbed over the walls to join them. The clashing of swords began again. 
The inner troops of the castle layout fought their ground on their own 
turf, and the screams of death came upon them. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Hinata sat quietly at the centre table of the living area of Nanase and 
Takahiro&#39;s residence. Though she had a greater concern on her mind. 
Things between herself and Nanase had been awkward since she had 
admitted her attraction to the samurai woman yesterday. It had also been 
the time for Hinata to admit her past relationship with Kanae; the 
reason she could never give herself to anyone else romantically The time 
she and Nanase now spent together was strained by those revelations. 
Hinata didn&#39;t know how to act when Nanase was around, and Nanase could 
barely be around Hinata without becoming tearful. It was hard on both of 
them. And made the possibility of Hinata looking for somewhere else to 
stay more of a possibility

Hinata exhaled and tried not think too much, until Nanase slid open the 
door from the outside and walked in, with a worried expression on her 
face, one that showed her concern quite plainly. Hinata was now curious 
about it.

&quot;Nanase?&quot; She said, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

The villager blinked. &quot;It&#39;s my brother. He has not yet returned. He said 
he had business to take care of this morning but I didn&#39;t think he would 
be out this late.&quot;

&quot;Are you worried?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Nanase answered, &quot;every time he goes out at night I worry. And 
now that the curfew has been placed, he could get arrested by one of the 
castle samurai. Oh, why does he always do this?&quot;

Hinata sighed, then shifted off the ground. Walking over to the sliding 
door, the awkwardness between them forgotten for the time being. The 
samurai woman looked back and said, &quot;Do not worry. I will find him. And 
bring him back to you.&quot;

&quot;...Miss Shinmyouji...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Hinata affirmed, &quot;I know that he means much to you. And I 
know that I risk arrest myself by leaving at night. But... I think I owe 
this to you. If I cannot give you my heart... I can at least give you 
assurance of your brother&#39;s safety.&quot;

Nanase didn&#39;t know what to say to that. She would be eternally grateful 
for all that Hinata had done for her and her brother, even if she could 
not return her feelings. &quot;...Thank you.&quot;

Hinata nodded to her, then left, sliding the door open and closed with 
her entry and exit Once she stepped out into the quiet night streets of 
Natsumura Village, she looked from one side of the road to the other. 
And then she saw something off in the distance The light of fire in 
dots, burning around the distant image of Katsubana-jo in the hills. Now 
she knew exactly where Takahiro was. 

&quot;They&#39;re attacking Katsubana-jo already!?&quot;
