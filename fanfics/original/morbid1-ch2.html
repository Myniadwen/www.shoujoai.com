On the northern side of town the Holland Manor was a bustle of activity 
and delight, completely unawares of the dark mood that was forming over 
their quaint little town. Lord Holland, a squatish middle aged man with 
a thick curly moustache and beard upon his face, was giddy as a school 
boy to see his home filled with so many of his fond friends and family. 
For once in his life he felt as if things would be moving forward again. 
All the servants had arranged a long table of food and beverages in the 
main hall, and one by one the guest who received notice of the 
development and came to meet the new Knight in town. Burnwell, the 
butler, was enjoying his new found attention as nobles from all around 
the area were arriving to meet and congratulate him on his newly found 
knighthood. 

Lord Holland fixed his top hat upon his head and place a monocle to his 
left eye while scanning the crowd, seeing his butler he crossed the main 
hall and gave Burnwell a hearty pat on the back, &quot;Good going Burnwell!&quot; 
He congratulated the butler in his deep cheerful voice and took a sip 
from a tall wine glass, &quot;It&#39;s not every day someone is knighted around 
these parts.&quot; He remarked with a smile and glimmer in his eyes.

&quot;It is a great honour indeed, my lord.&quot; Burnwell replied proudly as he 
straightened his white tie around his neck, &quot;And thank you so much for 
the party, my lord.&quot; He said with a smile as his dark eyes skimmed over 
the crowd at all the noble faces there to greet him.

&quot;I should be thanking you for bringing such grand news to this house 
after so many dark days.&quot; The Lord said spiritedly, &quot;It has been way to 
long since these halls were filled with laughter.&quot; In fact it had been 
over fifteen years since the halls heard any sound of cheer. There had 
been very little time for celebration or parties in the Holland Manor. 
The death of the Lord&#39;s dear wife hung heavy over the mansion. The fact 
that she passed away while giving birth to their two adorable twins did 
not make matters better. Even the presence of the twins could not 
brighten the atmosphere surrounding their home. 

&quot;So true, my lord.&quot; Burnwell agreed heavy heartedly, &quot;I miss those days 
so dearly.&quot; He wiped at his eye as a tear began to form, &quot;Oh, My lord 
have you met Charles Langton?&quot; He asked gesturing to a rather gangly 
androgynous man. The man held a martini glass between two fingers, his 
black hair was slicked back against his head and a stylish black tux 
hugged snugly to his body. &quot;He is an actor from the Westmire Playhouse 
in the town square.&quot; There was almost a note of pride in the butler&#39;s 
tone.

&quot;Ahh yes!&quot; The Lord extended a hand to shake the actors long thin 
fingers, &quot;I saw your enactment of Shakespeare&#39;s Macbeth. Who did you 
play again?&quot; He inquired more trying to create conversation then showing 
any real interest.

&quot;Please, don&#39;t call it that, my lordship. It is the Scottish play if you 
will.&quot; Charles corrected the man in a dramatic manner, &quot;And I was lady 
Macbeth.&quot; He remarked with a sip of his drink.

&quot;Yes yes.&quot; The Lord noted with a nod and fixed his monocle upon his eye, 
&quot;I think you did a marvellous portrayal of her madness.&quot; He complimented 
with a genuine laugh.

&quot;Why thank you, my lordship.&quot; The actor took a deep bow.

Holland glanced around the room, his smile suddenly replaced by worry, 
&quot;Burnwell, have you seen the Twins?&quot; He asked frantically searched the 
crowd for his adoring little girls. &quot;I asked them to join us, but have 
yet to see them.&quot;

Burnwell stretched his long neck out to look over the crowd, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
my lord. I do not see hide nor tail of them about.&quot; He too was becoming 
worrisome. Whenever those girls vanished, horrible things would follow 
and this was one night that he did not want to be ruined by those girls&#39; 
antics. 

&quot;You mean those adorable twin little girls dressed all in black, my 
lordship?&quot; Charles remarked with profound interest, &quot;I thought I saw 
them going out the front door a bit earlier.&quot; He pointed towards the far 
doors in which more guests were still entering.

&quot;Where is that Nanny when we need her?&quot; Lord Holland asked in a huff. He 
spotted his eldest daughter over by the wine table, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, if you 
excuse my rudeness. I need to attend to a few things.&quot; Holland stated, 
not letting his eyes off Lilian. 

&quot;It was a pleasure and an honour to meet you, my lordship.&quot; Charles said 
with a flourish and another bow.

&quot;The same.&quot; The lord replied not really paying much attention to the 
actor, as his mind was too busy fretting about his children. He ventured 
cross the hall in search of Lilian and found she had moved not far from 
where he last saw, &quot;Lilian? Lilian, have you seen Alison and 
Alexandria?&quot; He asked with a note of concern that was increasing in 
distress with ever passing second. 

Lilian was about to put a tall glass of white wine to her lips when she 
stopped and lazily looked around, &quot;I thought I saw Ansurez looking for 
them a moment ago. They are probably outside playing the maze or getting 
into trouble again, as always.&quot; Lilian commented indifferently. Lilian 
had just turned twenty, but it would seem her father was more concerned 
with the twins then to notice her. She tried to provoke the man by 
wearing sensual black strapless gowns, like the satin one she wore at 
that moment, dresses that showed the world how much of a beautiful woman 
she was growing up to be. Yet her father seemed to be oblivious to her 
actions and didn&#39;t even flinch no matter how many men she was on the arm 
of, &quot;You spoil those two far too much Father. Why not let them be?&quot; She 
sneered then drained the entire glass and waved it at one of the servant 
behind the wine table in indication that she needed another refill.

The Lord ignored his daughter&#39;s remarks, &quot;That Nanny is too much at 
times. I should really try to find another, but no one seemed to 
understand the children the way she does.&quot; He said still looking around 
the crowd for some sign of his children or the nanny.

At that moment Gladys Ansurez was muttering curses under her breath as 
she found herself venturing down the main road from Holland Manor in 
search of the twins, last she had sight of the children they were 
heading out of the main entrance to the hall and down the road, towards 
those dreadful hedge mazes. Gladys was hired on as the nanny for the 
Holland twins even before their birth. Some speculate the true 
intentions of the woman and her connection in the death of Lady Holland 
on that dreadful day, however few were willing to speak up for fear of 
what the woman would do to them. While not inanely evil in any way that 
people would put their finger on. She simply had this way of glaring at 
people that made even the bravest of men back down and then she would 
switch back to that loving smile that made so many of the other servants 
at Holland Manor shutter. 

She plodded along the only one road in and out of the grounds in hopes 
that she would come across the children. The road led from the main 
gates to a fountain outside the hall entrance where it circled around to 
come back towards the gates. The walls of a huge hedge maze stretched 
the entire length of the road, to either side. Topiaries marking the 
many entrances into maze, each trimmed to the likeness of some mythical 
creature. Gladys looked up at one of the topiaries and her black heart 
to shutter. Gladys prayed that the children would not be playing 
somewhere within that dreaded maze, but she knew the way those two were 
drawn to the mysteries of the mazes.

Her mind was forced from her prays by the sound of horses trotting down 
the road. She turned to see a rather impressive carriage coming here 
way, four beautiful white horses pranced along in front of a large white 
carriage with red curtains that cut out the view of anyone wanting a 
peek at who could be within. Gladys found she had to quickly move off 
the road and into the maze or she would have been run down and she had a 
feeling that the driver would have no animosity of doing so. 

The carriage rounded the fountain to come to a stop at the front steps 
to Holland Manor. A servant rushed over to the carriage to open the door 
for its patron. A thin man dressed in a white suit, top hat and gloves 
stepped out of the carriage, and then approached the front door. The 
servant rushed past the man to get the door for him. The man stepped 
through the foyer and came to an abrupt halt in the entrance to the 
hall. He turned to the servant and whispered something into the man&#39;s 
ear then handed him a letter before he sent the servant off with a wave 
of his hand while he stood patiently at the entrance. 

The servant rushed through the crowd until he found Lord Holland and 
swiftly moved to his side to whisper into the lord ear before handing 
him the letter. Lord Holland looked up at the man in white with a 
baffled expression upon his face, however upon opening the letter his 
expression paled ever so drastically. With haste the Lord searched the 
crowd, he anxiously bit on his knuckle as he looked for Burnwell. He 
found the butler standing near the drink table with his daughter and the 
actor. 

&quot;Burnwell!!&quot; He called out as he rushed over to the man, pushing his way 
through the crowd, &quot;Bu-rn-we-ll!!!&quot; This time he added emphasise on each 
and ever syllable of the man&#39;s name. There was displeasure in his eyes 
as he shoved a servant out of the way, knocking a tray of hors d&#39;oeuvres 
and the man to the ground. The Lord paused for only a moment to make 
sure the servant was all right before bolting after Burnwell again.

&quot;My lord this is a marvellous party.&quot; The butler stated with rosy cheeks 
as his lord appeared out of the crowd, &quot;The best in all of Holland 
Manor&#39;s years.&quot; He gestured slightly drunkenly.

&quot;We have a problem.&quot; Lord Holland stated in a hushed voice that only 
Burnwell could hear, &quot;Or rather YOU have a problem. Look near the front 
entrance. The man in white.&quot; He nodded his head slightly as not to alert 
others of the man&#39;s appearance.

Burnwell scanned the area and found the man in question, &quot;He looks like 
a rather elegant gent, my lord.&quot; He waved at the man only to not receive 
one in return, &quot;How ungentlemanly of him.&quot; Burnwell commented turning 
his nose up.

&quot;You fool.&quot; The lord spat, &quot;Can you not tell one of the Queen&#39;s royal 
messengers when you see one?&quot; He asked bluntly, now he seemed to have 
caught Charles&#39;s attention. 

&quot;Is there a problem, my lordship?&quot; The actor asked trying to see what 
the two men were squabbling over.

&quot;The Queen?&quot; The butler slobbered up quickly and blinked at the lord in 
confusion, ignoring the actor&#39;s comments entirely, &quot;Do you think I will 
be knighted by the Queen herself, my lord?&quot; He straightened up to look 
about, &quot;Is she here? How do I look?&quot; He straightened his jacket and tie 
in an attempt to look his best. 

Charles helped straighten the butler&#39;s tie, &quot;You look ravishing sir.&quot; He 
said with a loving smile that made Burnwell restless and knock the 
actor&#39;s hands away. He glanced over to see a rather displeased look upon 
his lord&#39;s face.

The Lord grabbed Burnwell by the collar and hauled him away from the 
actor, &quot;You idiot. He is not here to congratulate you. This is all a 
mistake.&quot; He shoved the letter into the man&#39;s hands, &quot;Take a look for 
yourself. You are not being knighted at all. I should have seen this 
coming.&quot; Holland stated with a frustrated sigh. 

&quot;This can&#39;t be!&quot; Burnwell opened the letter to find only a few lines 
were written and they simply said this:

&quot;We would never knight a man of such a disgraceful character... 
See to it that this farce of a party ends or you will find 
yourself as a guest of the tower..
Queen Victoria.&quot; 

The butler pulled on his tie as his neck became hot with worry, &quot;This is 
a joke right?&quot; The butler asked dumbfounded by this turn of events, &quot;I 
deserve it as much as any other man.&quot; 

&quot;That he does.&quot; Charles interjected, trying desperately to defend the 
butler. 

&quot;You stay out of this!&quot; The Lord snapped, &quot;And you...&quot; He turned his 
angry eyes upon to the butler, &quot;What have you done to deserve such a 
thing? I cannot believe I allowed myself to be apart of this mockery. 
How did you come across that summons for knighthood anyway?&quot; 

The butler shrugged, &quot;Here and there.&quot; He remarked with a sly grin as he 
snatched a glass of wine off a passing drink tray and took a sip only to 
have to taken out of his hands by the lord. 

&quot;That is enough out of you.&quot; The Lord demanded in disgust, &quot;You have 
some explaining to do.&quot; He then mounted the stairs so he could get a 
better vantage point, &quot;Everyone could I get your attention?&quot; He called 
out over the crowd. It took only a moment for the murmurs to die down so 
they could better hear what their Lord had to say. 

&quot;Thank you...&quot; Lord Holland felt distressed by the multitude of eyes 
upon him at that moment. &quot;Ummm... I would like to thank you all for 
joining us on this wonderful autumn night. It has been exceedingly 
wonderful to see all your faces again after so long a time. It burdens 
me so to have to tell you all that tonight&#39;s party must be cancelled.&quot; 
The air filled with the sounds of moans of disappointment, &quot;I am so very 
sorry. It would seem there has been a grave misunderstanding and 
Burnwell is not being knighted after all.&quot; The moans turned to the 
sounds of infuriate anger as one by the people started to understand the 
situation. The lord backed up the stairs as the crowd started to turn to 
an irate mob, &quot;Burnwell, this is your problem.&quot; The lord stated before 
rushing up the stairs and out of the hall. 

&quot;My lord!?!&quot; Burnwell called out after his master. He turned to find 
hundreds of furious faces staring up at him, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Was all 
he could muster.    

&quot;Well, this does not look good in the least bit.&quot; Charles muttered 
aloud. 

&quot;You are not helping!&quot; Burnwell snarled at the actor.
