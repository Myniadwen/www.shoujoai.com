Brand-new You

Natalie and Kima exited the mall with several bags in their hands. A 
fresh spring breeze rushed passed them, causing their hair to flutter. 
Kima smiled at the feeling and ran a hand through her newly cut hair, &quot;I 
wish I&#39;d cut my hair earlier.&quot; She exclaimed, then ran off across the 
field with her arms out stretched and spinning around, &quot;Do you really 
like it Natalie?&quot; She asked her friend. 

Natalie surveyed her friend&#39;s new look once again. Kima&#39;s hair was cut 
shoulder length with the back layered, she left the front with intent to 
let the bangs grew out, Natalie thought the hairdresser going to have a 
heart attack when Kima told her how short she wanted it. Kima also 
sported new attire comprised of a pair of baggy brown cargo pants and a 
tight black tank top. Natalie still found it hard to keep from staring 
at the girl in astonishment over the transformation. Even though she had 
been there during the whole process Natalie still found herself stunned 
by how different her friend looked and how well this new style suited 
her, &quot;You really look great.&quot; She finally mustered to say, &quot;Really.&quot;

Kima blushed and spun around one last time then gazed up at the sky, &quot;I 
never felt so free before.&quot; She smiled and closed her eyes while staring 
at the sun, a small tear formed in the corner of her eye, &quot;Too bad it 
won&#39;t last.&quot; She said sadly and lowered her head. 

Natalie approached Kima and set her hand upon the girl&#39;s shoulder, 
&quot;Everything will work out, you&#39;ll see.&quot; 

&quot;But what if I don&#39;t want to go back?&quot; Kima said in almost a whisper, 
&quot;What if she never accepts me?&quot; She rubbed her eye with the back of her 
hand. 

Natalie watched this for a moment. No matter how different the two 
Kimberly&#39;s acted they were still very much alike. She wrapped her arm 
around the red head and pulled her close, &quot;It is alright.&quot; Natalie said 
ever so softly, &quot;She just needs some time to sort things out. She&#39;ll 
come around. You&#39;ll see. You both are a part of each other.&quot; 

Kima pulled back a little, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right.&quot; She wiped at her eyes 
one last time then took a deep breath, &quot;She needs me.&quot; She said with a 
smile, and then spun around and started to run towards the western dorm, 
&quot;Come on Nat. I want to show Kim our new look.&quot; She exclaimed excitedly. 

Natalie rubbed the back of her head. She felt it was not going to be 
easy to get used to this new Kim, &quot;Hey wait up!&quot; Natalie called out as 
she ran after her friend. The two of them laughed as they crossed the 
grass towards the Western Dorm and bust into the building still laughing 
and giggling however their cheerfulness died away the moment they 
stepped into the lobby. 

Sitting upon one of the couched was Kimberly, Kris and Jessica and 
across from them was none other than Head Mistress Sophia. She turned to 
watch the two girls as they entered the room, &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you are 
enjoying yourselves.&quot; She said with a smile. 

&quot;H... head Mistress!?!&quot; Natalie nervously glanced from the head mistress 
to Kima, who was now hiding behind her, &quot;Jessica!?!&quot; She glared at the 
dorm head.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me.&quot; Jessica put up her hands defensively. 

&quot;I came of my own accord. &quot;Sophia stated as she stood, &quot;I was worried 
about Kim here, after Amy told me about her wounds I wanted to check on 
her myself. Then I received this.&quot; She tapped on a brown folder in her 
lap; &quot;I thought something was unusual for I have never received a double 
copy of any file before.&quot; She peered around Natalie, &quot;However, this is a 
little unexpected.&quot; She smiled at Kima, &quot;I will not harm you. Let&#39;s have 
a look at you.&quot; Kima nervously stepped out from behind her friend. 

Kim abruptly stood in shock, &quot;You cut my hair!?!&quot; She exclaimed, stunned 
to see herself with short hair, silently she had always wanted to have 
short hair, to feel the breeze on her neck but was too afraid to ask. 
Now here was her other half, a braver half, doing all the things she 
only wished she could do, exposed arms and a tight sure that showed off 
just how much she had developed over the years, along with a new 
haircut. Sadness filled the girl&#39;s eyes that Kima noticed and was about 
to open her mouth when Jessica jumped to her feet.

&quot;Wow!!!&quot; Jessica said in astonishment as she approached Kima, eyeing her 
up and down, &quot;I thought you were a cutie before, but now this sight 
really makes my heart ache.&quot; She reached out to run a hand through 
Kima&#39;s hair, causing her to shivered at the girl&#39;s touch and gave 
Jessica an intense look that Jessica could only describe as hunger. Kima 
bit her lip and reached out to caress the girl&#39;s cheek with the back of 
her hand and it was Jessica turn to step back from the red head, 
swallowing hard and blushing. 

&quot;Carefully Jessie.&quot; Natalie said with a sly grin, &quot;This girl can give 
you a run for your money.&quot; She chuckled softly.

&quot;I... I can see that...&quot; Jessica had to shake her head, &quot;Maybe we should 
put a sign around her neck warning the other girls.&quot; 

Kima blushed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She turned her gazed to the ground, ashamed 
of herself. 

Sophia approached Kima and examined her over closely, &quot;This is 
definitely something.&quot; She remarked, &quot;You look exactly like Kimberly and 
at the same time.&quot; She took the girl&#146;s chin in her hand to raise her 
eyes to meet her own, &quot;There is something there that was not present in 
your counterpart&#39;s eyes.&quot; Sophia herself found it hard to pull away from 
those ruby red eyes. She too needed to shake her head to clear it before 
proceeding to open the file she held in her hand, &quot;It never ceases to 
amaze me how accurate these files can be.&quot;

&quot;What does it say?&quot; Kim asked curious what was written about her 
reflection. 

&quot;Nothing special.&quot; Sophia said lightly, &quot;Just that she has a fresh cut 
along her left arm.&quot; Nodding towards Kima&#39;s arm, causing the girl to 
wrap her arms around her stomach, &quot;The most interesting thing is the 
photo.&quot; Sophia turned the file around so that the others could see. Upon 
the upper right corner of the first page was a small picture. It showed 
Kima with the same short hair and clothes that she wore at that very 
moment. 

&quot;But I just cut my hair!&quot; Kima stated in confusion, &quot;How could...?&quot; 

&quot;How can a reflection come to life?&quot; Sophia simply returned. 

Kima nervously fiddled with the bottom of her shirt, &quot;I don&#39;t know... I 
just...&quot; She felt cornered and was looking for a place to hide when 
Sophia gave the girl a reassuring pat on the head.

&quot;No need to worry.&quot; She said with a grin, &quot;You are both welcome here. No 
one is going to take you away.&quot;

&quot;Really!?!&quot; Kima&#39;s eyes brightly light up, &quot;I can stay here???&quot; She 
asked excitedly. 

&quot;Yes, you can stay as long as you like.&quot; Sophia stated with a nod, 
&quot;However, I would like you and Kim to see Amy tomorrow if possible.&quot;   

&quot;Why me?&quot; Kim protested. 

&quot;You got cut as well did you not?&quot; Sophia replied. 

Kim shyly gazed at the ground, &quot;yeah...&quot; 

Sophia knelt next to Kim, &quot;I know that you may not like your reflection, 
but try to get along with her, okay?&quot; She gave the girl a wink, and then 
stood up, &quot;Now that you all are aware that we know of Kima&#39;s presence 
you don&#39;t have to worry about hiding her anymore. She is welcome here 
just like the rest of you.&quot;

Jessica let out a sigh of relief, &quot;I was really worried about how we 
were going to handle that.&quot; She said. 

Sophia turned to look at Jessica, &quot;The next time you find a new girl 
here don&#39;t be afraid to tell us. We more than likely already are aware 
that they will be arriving, we just need to be told when they get here. 
Alright?&quot;

Jessica felt embarrassed, &quot;Sorry Head Mistress&quot;

&quot;No need for apologies.&quot; Sophia assured, &quot;Which reminds me. You will 
have a new addition to the dorms sometime soon. I hope there is enough 
room.&quot; 

Jessica ran over to the office and brought out the book of room 
listings, &quot;We still have some openings, however it is becoming a crowded 
year.&quot; She expressed a bit concerned. 

&quot;That it is.&quot; Sophia said with a sigh, &quot;I&#39;m sorry if this is a rough 
year on you all.&quot; She apologized.  

&quot;Nah.&quot; Jessica closed the book and glanced at the group of girls that 
she&#39;d just made into friends. Her eyes fell on Kris and she smiled then 
returned her gaze to Sophia, &quot;I think this is going to be a great year.&quot; 
She said enthusiastically. 

&quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; Sophia said, &quot;Myself or Missy will return from time to time 
to check up on things. Have a good evening girls.&quot; She started out of 
the building with the girls saying their farewells at her feet.
