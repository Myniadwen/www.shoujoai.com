<h1>Prophecy of Krishinda: The Kusagana Myth (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/krishinda-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>It had been three days since the Heaven Slayers arrived at the 
Soujumah temple from Mitsuki&#146;s wedding. The actual preparations had 
been running quite smoothly, and any outstanding queries concerning 
both clans were taken care of by Kazue and Genzo. 
 
Finally, the wedding was ready to get underway. Things had not been 
running smoothly between the Heaven Slayers though. Mitsuki and Akira 
were too afraid to talk to each other. Anju and Miki were closer then 
ever, but Anju was distrusted by many of the Soujumah clan, including 
Kazue. And Akira was mad at Genzo for allowing this wedding to pass. 
 
Despite these problems, there was nothing that stood in the way of 
Mitsuki&#146;s marriage to Kai.
 
Today was the day.
 
Mitsuki was in her quarters. She was sitting down, in her long, 
shimmering white wedding dress that took twenty seamstresses half of a 
year to make. It was beautiful, Mitsuki knew that, but it didn&#146;t make 
her feel special. It felt...empty. The same way Mitsuki had felt for 
the past day or so. Mitsuki had not spoken to Akira since that night 
on the upper tower. 
 
She was too afraid of what she might say or do if she did speak to 
Akira. Problem was that as soon as the wedding was over, the Heaven 
Slayers would be moving out to find the last devil. Then she would 
probably never see Akira again. 
 
Every time Mitsuki thought about that, she had to choke back a sob. 
Mitsuki could not stand the idea of losing Akira. Not only that, but 
would also have to leave her grandfather, Miki and Anju. The young 
healer didn&#146;t know *anyone* here accept for Kai. In fact the only 
Soujumah clan member that Mitsuki knew personally was Miki.
 
Mitsuki sighed as a knock came on the door to her room. For some 
reason, she hoped it was...well no need anymore.
 
&#147;Come in.&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
Miki walked in and faked a smile. The Soujumah priestess had seen how 
dejected and cold Akira and Mitsuki had become since they found out 
about the marriage. It was also a bit of a kick in the crotch for 
Akira when Miki agreed to be Mitsuki&#146;s bridesmaid, but this really was 
only because Akira had refused outright.
 
&#147;You okay? How are you feeling?&#148; Miki asked concerned. 
 
&#147;Fine I guess...how&#146;s Akira?&#148; 
 
Miki gaze turned distant. &#147;She is...doing fine...you really shouldn&#146;t 
worry.&#148;  
 
&#147;I can&#146;t help it. I wont see her or any of you again.&#148; Mitsuki said.
 
Miki sat down with Mitsuki on the bed, and she pulled her arm around 
the young healer, pulling her into a friendly hug. 
 
&#147;We&#146;ll come and visit. All of us will. Even Akira. I&#146;ll make her come 
even if I have to drag her here by the neck.&#148;
 
Mitsuki giggled slightly. &#147;Thanks. I&#146;m going to miss you all.&#148;
 
**********
 
On the other side of the Soujumah temple, inside the training hall, 
Akira was sharpening Dragon-edge. She was wearing a male&#146;s wedding 
uniform, which is compulsory after you become a knight for the 7th 
Order. Kinda typical when you thought about it. The only clothes that 
a knight could wear were male ones. Unless told not to. 
 
Akira ran the flint rock in her hand over the Dragon-edge. Although 
she wasn&#146;t wearing her armour, she would keep Dragon-edge with her. 
Though the actual risk was minimal, there was always a chance that the 
last devil would attack the wedding. So she had to keep her sword with 
her at all times. 
 
The young knight wouldn&#146;t have minded if a devil destroyed the wedding 
though. In Akira&#146;s head it was all bogus. Mitsuki did not love Kai; 
therefore she shouldn&#146;t have to marry him. 
 
As Akira continued to sharpen her blade, Kai walked through the doors 
of the training hall. The fist that Akira around Dragon-edge 
tightened, and Akira closed her eyes in disbelief. The one person who 
Akira absolutely did not want to be around her had just appeared. 
 
Kai walked up to Akira slowly. &#147;Hello, Miss Kusagana.&#148;
 
Akira could have done something to quell her nerves, like punch him, 
or at least insult him, but Akira wouldn&#146;t do that. Mitsuki *was* 
going to marry him, so she had to at least be civil. If not for him 
then for Mitsuki.
 
&#147;Hello.&#148; Akira had to force politeness into that.
 
&#147;I&#146;ve noticed that you and Mitsuki seemed to have grown apart these 
past few days...is anything wrong?&#148; Kai asked.
 
{Is it any of your business, you slimy little sh-}
&#147;You&#146;re imagining things. Mitsuki and I are fine.&#148; Akira said.
 
Kai coughed into his fist. &#147;Okay then. Forgive my intrusion.&#148;
 
Akira stopped sharpening the Dragon-edge, and after admiring it clear 
sheen for a few seconds, she sheathed the blade. Akira pushed herself 
up onto her feet and then looked directly at Kai, her will to keep her 
cool fading fast. 
 
&#147;Thanks for your concern, but we&#146;re fine. However, you could do me one 
little favour.&#148;
 
Kai thought to himself. &#147;What is it?&#148;
 
It was then that Akira looked stone hard at Kai, and for the first 
time, Kai actually seemed nervous. &#147;Look after Mitsuki.&#148;
 
&#147;Sure, I-&#147; Akira didn&#146;t give Kai a chance to finish. 
 
&#147;Because I don&#146;t care if you are a priest, if you hurt Mitsuki,&#148; 
Akira&#146;s eyes narrowed into very thin slits. &#147;I&#146;ll kill you.&#148;
 
&#147;Uh...yeah...sure...I&#146;ll guard her with my life.&#148; Kai said nervously.
 
Akira walked close to Kai, and stared at him coldly. &#147;You better...&#148;
 
**********
 
Later on that day, the ceremony was about to begin. Much like Akira&#146;s 
appointment as a knight, Mitsuki&#146;s wedding would take place inside 
temple walls, in this case, the Soujumah temple. Many people had 
gathered up from across Juukumei to see this. Soujumah/Kiryu clan 
members, people from Daitoshi city and Hakumakyuu, priests from over 
clans and other guests were here. 
 
Genzo was at the side of the chapel with Anju, awaiting the arrival of 
Mitsuki and Kai. Akira was sitting in the crowds, because she didn&#146;t 
want Akira to see her, and Miki was up front next to the altar and the 
priest who would conduct the ceremony. 
 
Kai walked up the aisle waving to a few of hundreds of guests that 
were present, and stood parallel to Miki. Then, the pianist started to 
play a warming theme, and everyone in their seats arose as Mitsuki 
walked into the large chapel, with her clear white veil over her face 
and Genzo on her arm. 
 
The two walked up to the front of the chapel, and Mitsuki disengaged 
from Genzo&#146;s arm, walking up to Kai.
 
Akira had to grudgingly admit it, but Mitsuki really did look really 
beautiful in that dress. 
 
Eventually, the pianist stopped playing that music, and everyone that 
stood up sat back down. Eventually, the priest began the vows, and 
Akira just tuned it out. 
 
Until it got to the end of the ceremony...
 
&#147;Do you, Kai Hashumaki, take Mitsuki Kiryu to be your eternally bonded 
wife?&#148; said the priest.
 
Kai looked at Mitsuki and smiled. &#147;I do.&#148;
 
The priest looked back at Mitsuki. &#147;Do you, Mitsuki Kiryu, take Kai 
Hashumaki to be your eternally bonded husband?&#148;
 
Mitsuki didn&#146;t answer.
 
The priest became a bit more forceful. &#147;Do you?&#148;
 
Mitsuki still didn&#146;t say anything, and people in the crowd began to 
mutter and whisper to themselves. Then Mitsuki spoke.
 
&#147;I&#146;m sorry,&#148; Mitsuki said, tears in her eyes. &#147;I can&#146;t...&#148;
 
Mitsuki then gathered up her dress and ran for the doors. Akira 
quickly stood up from her place in the crowds and ran after her, 
barging past the people in her way. 
 
**********
 
About fifteen minutes later, Mitsuki had ran out of the whole Soujumah 
temple, and out to the grassy areas on the cliffs. She was curled up 
into to a ball, shivering. Her dress matted with soil and grass from 
the ground. Akira walked up to see Mitsuki, curled up and crying her 
eyes out. 
 
{She wasn&#146;t ready.} Akira thought. 
 
Still crying, Mitsuki only stopped briefly when a pair of strong arms 
wrapped around her and held her close. It was Akira. Akira pulled 
Mitsuki up onto her feet, and held her in an unyielding embrace. 
Mitsuki managed to say something, but her wracking sobs and the fabric 
of Akira&#146;s uniform only muffled it.
 
&#147;What are you trying to say?&#148; Akira whispered.
 
Mitsuki pulled herself away from Akira&#146;s shoulder, and she stared at 
her best friend apologetically, tears streaking down her pale cheeks.
 
&#147;I&#146;m so...sorry...&#148; She said. Akira took no notice, and brought 
Mitsuki&#146;s back to rest on her shoulder.
 
&#147;Stop apologizing, you&#146;ve done nothing wrong. You weren&#146;t ready...&#148;
 
Suddenly, a shot was fired at the Soujumah temple, and the main tower 
came down in flames, smashing into the main courtyard. Akira&#146;s eyes 
shot open, and off in the distance, a huge hulking creature was 
walking towards them. 
 
It was about eight feet tall, in massive steel plated armour, with an 
imprint of a gold panther on its chest. Its fists were protruding 
three-inch long spikes, its helmet had on large spike facing 
diagonally forwards. The only biological part of its body was its 
white eyes, barely visible through the small rectangular slit in its 
helmet. It was holding a giant sword in its left fist, and the demon 
was walking straight towards Akira and Mitsuki.
 
&#147;The sixth devil...&#148; Akira gasped.
 
Mitsuki stopped crying enough to see its slow methodical advance. 
Akira pulled Mitsuki quickly behind her, and drew Dragon-edge from the 
scabbard on her back.
 
&#147;Mitsuki, stay back.&#148; Akira said. 
 
Mitsuki nodded to her best friend, and Akira ran towards the devil, 
quickly before it could do any more damage. 
 
Akira and the sixth devil slowed to a stop as they faced each other. 
 
The young knight held firm. &#147;I suppose it&#146;s no good to tell to get the 
hell away from here, huh?&#148;
 
The devil spoke slowly, but deeply, his voice echoed by the large 
helmet it was wearing. &#147;You...killed...siblings...I kill you...&#148;
 
The sixth devil roared in anger and swung its gigantic sword at Akira. 
The dark haired girl jumped out of the way to avoid the strike and the 
sixth devil&#146;s sword crashed into the ground, creating a long crack 
along the grassy terrain. 
 
When Akira landed, she had no time to think, as he sixth devil swung 
his sword horizontally, and the young knight ducked down to avoid the 
backlash of the swing. 
 
The devil managed to raise the huge steel sword back into the air, and 
watched Akira scramble to her feet.
 
The young knight stepped back quickly, and observed a tree that was 
behind her. It was hanging down in a slumped position, cut at the 
middle. Akira then realized that the devil&#146;s last swing had done that 
with *just* the air pressure. That meant that one clear hit from that 
sword would kill.
 
It was then that Akira started to become wary of the devil. It was a 
little more powerful then she gave it credit for. The sixth devil 
brought the sword down again, and Akira dove to the left to avoid the 
attack, tumbling across the grass of the ground. 
 
Akira gradually pulled herself back onto her feet, using the 
Dragon-edge for minor balance. Casting a dark glare at the devil, she 
started to think to herself on how to beat the thing.
 
{This thing is tough. It&#146;s not fast, but strong as hell. But I can&#146;t 
just keep on running from it. I need to attack...if I could just get 
inside...}
 
Akira smiled as she got an idea. The young knight casually strolled up 
to the devil, and jeered at it. 
 
&#147;Come on, swing that sword at me again and see if you can hit me!&#148; 
Akira yelled mockingly.
 
The sixth devil growled furiously at her, and swung its sword in 
Akira&#146;s immediate direction. Rolling swiftly under the swing, Akira 
got back onto her feet and used the devil&#146;s wasted motion against it. 
Akira ran up to the devil, and slashed at its armour, ducking down 
again as the devil brought its sword back around.
 
Akira slid back to see the damage she had done, but gasped as she saw 
that she had done absolutely nothing. 
 
The devil&#146;s steel plated armour wasn&#146;t even scratched, and then Akira 
seriously began to wonder if she could beat this thing alone. 
 
The sixth devil brought the sword up its chest and put the out end of 
the sword, the blade, into its free hand. The sword was now spread out 
horizontally, facing Akira. It started to glow with an eerie jade 
light, and a powerful energy blast shot out from it. 
 
Even though Akira did manage to avoid the attack, the explosion was 
unavoidable, and she was tossed into the air, hurled across the flat 
grassland outside the Soujumah temple. Akira landed on her back, a few 
metres away from the actual blast point and was barely holding onto 
the Dragon-edge. All she could do was cough, and wipe the small trail 
of blood that was dripping down the side of her mouth. 
 
Akira then began to wonder why the devil didn&#146;t finish her off, it was 
in the perfect position to, but then saw that it was aiming its next 
wave at...
 
{Mitsuki!} Akira thought in urgency. 
 
Akira coughed again and rolled onto her side, the emerald flaming 
energy from the sixth devil&#146;s sword charging up again. By the time 
Akira had gotten back up it was too late, the devil shot a blast at 
Mitsuki, the emerald wave heading directly for her. Mitsuki became 
distinctly aware of what was about to happen, and started running, but 
it was too little, too late. The blast was awkwardly aimed so it 
missed Mitsuki&#146;s direction it the same way that missed Akira, but the 
explosion knocked Mitsuki off her feet, and over the cliff hanging 
above the Vestaile Nostrum. 
 
Time suddenly slowed down for Mitsuki, rubble and cinders from the 
cliff face falling alongside her. Closing her eyes in preparation for 
death, Mitsuki suddenly saw flashes of everything she had experienced 
in her life. Her training to become a healer, her parent&#146;s deaths, her 
meeting with Akira, the journey for the six devils.  This was how it 
all ended for Mitsuki. But what affected her most was the great irony 
of the situation.
 
She had never told Akira how she felt.
 
Mitsuki clamped her eyes shut even tighter, waiting for the end, and 
it took her time to realize that she wasn&#146;t falling anymore. The first 
thing she did was look down. She was about fifty metres above the 
water and jagged rocks below her. Then she looked forwards to see 
Akira&#146;s face smiling at her, her arms wound around Mitsuki&#146;s body. The 
blonde smiled back, held Akira even closer to her, momentarily 
forgetting the situation they were in. 
 
Soon after that, Mitsuki did question *how* she was still alive and 
*why* she and Akira were floating in midair. Until she actually saw 
why...
 
She and Akira were floating in midair, because a long pair of angelic 
wings protruding from Akira&#146;s back...were holding them aloft...
