Angel of Ra School, (City of) Cath Maige Tuired 

&quot;That&#39;s it! Keep up with the swift attacks!&quot;

It had been two months since that dark event known as Ten Sekai Sentou 
Kyousou. All participants had escaped off the island alive. And the 
details over the events had reached the Neo World Federation. But Ra El 
Khahid did not bother to focus on any of it. The staff fighter and 
former mass-murderer gave warm smiles to his pupils as he walked back 
and forth ahead of them. In that large echoing gym they all made 
synchronized attacks with their individual staffs until the instruction 
of Ra. They were all progressing well. And if he could pass this style 
onto as many people as possible, it would help future generations of 
people deal with evils that were at work in this world.

Ra had broken free of the control of the Quetzacoatl. And thus returned 
to his normal self. Though his hands had been stained with much blood 
along the way; he knew that the blame lay with nothing else other that 
the Quetzacoatl staff. But thankfully had been sealed away in one of the 
shrines in the city of Cath Maige Tuired. There, it would never be able 
to hurt another living being. And Ra kept close to it. He knew the kind 
of damage it could do. So he stayed near by to make sure no one ever 
used it again. 

Ra smiled at his students again. &quot;Alright, Class! That&#39;s enough! Take a 
break!&quot;

The collective group of about twenty or thirty people stopped in their 
actions and flopped to the floor. They took deep breaths and regained 
their energy. Ra could be one tough task master. Not that it wasn&#39;t 
worth it. For such an extensive training regime, he didn&#39;t charge a lot 
for an entrance fee. While his students took a break, Ra El Khahid 
walked back to the front of the room and took a look at the wooden table 
that was there. It had a thick stone there, with some of the names of 
the people that the Quetzacoatl had killed. Ra clapped his hands 
together and gave a short prayer for them. But thoughts also turned to 
Setsuya Seisuji. He would eternally be in that boy&#39;s debt. For finally 
breaking him free of the curse. 

Ra smiled to himself. &quot;I thank you from the bottom of my heart, 
Setsuya.&quot;

Mazda Family Training Camp, Fuzhou, Neo-China 

&quot;Do you have any idea what you have done!? Adding two failures to our 
previously untarnished name! You have forsaken yourself, Ming Lo!&quot;

Ming Lo Mazda, the only current female descendant of the Mazda Family 
slapped one of her eyelids shut as she listened to her grandfather, 
Ahura Mazda, bellow his fury. She had gone to Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou 
to defeat Ra El Khahid. But even more than that; to prove that she was 
worthy of the Mazda name. And that women should have every right to be 
apart of the First Assassin Line. To fight alongside the men. But Ming 
Lo had failed. And it didn&#39;t go down too well with the Family. Least of 
which, her grandfather. Ming Lo had left Baal in her room. And had come 
to Ahura&#39;s room in the main tower. She had expected him to be angry 
after what she had done. But he was even more furious than she could 
have possibly imagined.

&quot;You foolish girl!&quot; Ahura yelled, &quot;You have brought shame to me and our 
Family! How dare you take up an assassination attempt when I warned you 
not to get involved? Not only did you deceive me but you failed the 
mission anyway!&quot;

Ming Lo lowered her head, bowing before her grandfather. &quot;I apologize, 
sir. I know what I did was wrong. But I only wished to show you that my 
merits as an assassin have nothing to do with myself as a woman. Women 
should be allowed the same status in the Mazda Family as men have.&quot;

Ahura curled his hand into fist and rested his cheek on it. &quot;Merits? 
Status? What does any of that mean to you now? You failed. You added to 
our problems. You did not rectify them. Such actions are unforgivable. 
But since you wish to be treated like a male Mazda, you shall be.&quot;

Ming Lo&#39;s eyes brightened as she looked up. &quot;Really, grandfather?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ahura replied, &quot;Just like any male member of the Mazda 
Family who fails to kill their target, you will be excluded from our 
camp and our family.&quot;

And suddenly enough, her smile fell. &quot;W-What are you saying, 
grandfather...?&quot;

Ahura Mazda&#39;s dark and powerful eyes looked down upon the young Ming Lo. 
He had cared deeply for her. It was one of the reason he sent her to 
train in Japan under the best teachers he could find. But she had done 
further damage to the image of the Mazda Family. Her time as one of them 
was over.

The old assassin stood upright from his throne. &quot;The failure of someone 
in our own ranks is never tolerated. Ming Lo Mazda. From this moment on 
you are formally banished from our family and our order.&quot;

Ming Lo&#39;s heart fell. 

Was she... no longer a member of the proud and illustrious Mazda 
Family...?

McAmish Manor, Edinburgh, Scotland

In two months of life in Scotland, Ayame Nakagawa could officially say 
that it was nothing like Neo-Japan. Since it lacked its own Safe Zone, 
life here was far more loose and rural. There was very little good that 
could be said for life outside of the Safe Zones, but this country was 
the slight exception. Its people were friendly and polite in most ways. 
She could understand why Simon was so patriotic about the place. Which 
was one of the reasons she had come to visit him today. In the morning, 
Ayame had quickly got out of bed, got dressed, and walked up the snowy 
hills of the outer reaches of Edinburgh. On a tall, wide hill over 
looking the so-called &#39;Frozen Lake of the Snow Maiden&#39;, was a tombstone. 
One that had been erected for the late Simon McAmish. Ayame walked up to 
the tombstone, wading through the snow, and stepped up to the slab of 
stone. She wiped off all the snow that had gathered up on it during the 
night and let out a visible puff of air. 

&quot;Hey, sir,&quot; She spoke, &quot;It&#39;s me, Ayame. I know its sort of weird, me 
coming to visit you in the cold-ass morning like this. But I guess I 
needed to say a few things. Life these past five months has been hard. 
First with losing you and falling for Julia, then that fiasco with Ras 
es-Shamrah. And then adjusting to life here in a foreign land. But I&#39;ve 
come through it all so well. And so has Julia. We love each other and we 
wanna make it work. But... I wouldn&#39;t have her in my life if not for 
you. If we hadn&#39;t met on that day, five months ago, then I&#39;d still be 
the Dark Katana. I&#39;d still have Nobunaga perpetually strapped to my 
waist. And I&#39;d probably wind up dead eventually. It&#39;s thanks to you that 
I&#39;ve avoided that and found something worth while to live for. So I 
guess what I&#39;m trying to say is... thank you.&quot;

Ayame crouched down and stroked the black-tone tombstone. &quot;Thank you so 
much, sir.&quot;

&quot;Ayame!&quot;

The girl of Neo-Japanese origin stood up as she heard a beautifully 
familiar voice coming from behind her. She swung around and stumbled a 
bit as Julia flung herself into Ayame&#39;s arms, with a noticeably large 
diamond ring on her wedding ring finger. 

&quot;Where&#39;ve you been?&quot; The shorter woman prodded, giggling, &quot;I didn&#39;t see 
you in bed this morning when I woke up. It was kinda lonely...&quot;

Ayame shook her head quickly. &quot;I just had to say a few things to your 
Father before we made all the arraignments. I still can&#39;t believe they 
allow same-sex marriage in your country.&quot;

Julia waved a finger at Ayame, smiling. &quot;Well remember that this isn&#39;t a 
Safe Zone! Things are different here. And we are going to be so happy 
here together. I even heard that the leader of the Shougatsu Financial 
Group was killed a while back. I doubt we&#39;ll ever have to worry about 
them again. Now we can concentrate on the important things. Like what 
we&#39;ll be doing for our wedding. You know, what we&#39;ll all be wearing, 
who&#39;s coming, what we&#39;ll be serving at the reception. Stuff like that.&quot;

And Ayame sweat dropped. All she really wanted to do was just get 
married! &quot;Uh... I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m the right person to handle all of 
that stuff... you know I&#39;ve never been that kind of girl. I&#39;d just be 
happy with some beer or something...&quot;

Julia frowned playfully. &quot;Forget it! We&#39;re a couple. We make joint 
decisions, remember? Consider it my last act as a McAmish. After all, in 
a month or so, I&#39;ll be Julia Nakagawa.&quot;

And that was the only real thing Ayame cared about. Julia being her 
wife. The two of them living together alone, maybe adopting a kid and 
starting a family. The silver-eyed woman smiled and stole a quick kiss 
from Julia, then began walking back down the hill with her. It was the 
beginning of the rest of their lives. Together. &quot;I&#39;ll live to make you 
happy... Julia Nakagawa.&quot;

Dragon&#39;s Breath Forest, outside Neo-China  

There was a great party taking place in Lin-Lin&#39;s village. She had just 
gotten back home today, even though Setsuya had freed her two months 
ago. It was decided that Lin-Lin should see a little more of Europe 
before she went home. And that was what happened. With Setsuya as her 
guardian, Lin-Lin toured the European Safe-Zones. Enjoying the left she 
thought she would lose at the hands of the Shougatsu Financial Group. 
Eventually Lin-Lin and Setsuya met up with Ingrid and Aarin in Prague. 
From there they went back to China so that Lin-Lin got home okay. It was 
a proud moment when Lin-Lin returned there. Everyone was pleased to see 
her. Especially her grandfather, Chen Hu, whom had been worried about 
her the most. But they were also equally cheerful and thankful to the 
three heroes who rescued one of their own. Setsuya, Aarin, and Ingrid. 
The village held a party in their honour. The whole of the village 
populous turned out to give a hand in the preparations for it. And 
Setsuya couldn&#39;t resist in giving them a hand. Soon a huge assortment of 
Chinese foods were gathered together around a burning fire in the centre 
of the village. And the party was started. It carried on into the 
darkness of the night. But the people here had no intention of stopping 
the celebrations. It was in honour of the people who risked their lives 
for a member of their own village. They were actually bound to such 
activities. And it was no less than what the trio deserved for their 
efforts. 

Ingrid sat within a small ring of boys her own age who, unsurprisingly, 
were spellbound by the beautiful young woman. And being the kind of 
person that she was, Ingrid took no qualms in enjoying that attention. 
Lin-Lin sat with her grandfather; telling him all that had happened to 
her after the Shougatsu Financial Group&#39;s kidnap of her. But the one 
person who kept back from all the festivities was Aarin. The English 
swordsman stood leaning against a tree just a few paces away from some 
of the other villagers who sat around the fire. He was never very 
comfortable with big crowds of people. And Setsuya had noticed this. The 
Japanese man stood up from his seat next to Lin-Lin; while the villagers 
sang, drank and ate, and walked up to the pensive blonde. 

Setsuya stopped in stride and snacked on a bowl of rice he was carrying. 
&quot;Penny for your thoughts.&quot;

&quot;I was...&quot; Aarin looked up to the starry sky above, &quot;Thinking about what 
Zephaniah said to us back on the Island of Creation. He said that we 
would one day see the &#39;true nature&#39; of the world. What did he mean by 
that, I wonder?&quot;

Setsuya shrugged. &quot;Who knows? But we have nothing to worry about now. 
The word is that the Shougatsu have disbanded ever since Neuschwanstein 
Castle. I guess they didn&#39;t have all that much organization after 
Zephaniah died. Good riddance, if you ask me.&quot;

&quot;But Zephaniah wasn&#39;t the only issue,&quot; Aarin&#39;s mind cast back to that 
day, two months ago. And the woman he saw within the halls of the 
castle, &quot;Diana. What of her?&quot; 

&quot;Probably dead,&quot; Setsuya said bluntly, &quot;Unless she escaped 
Neuschwanstein before it burned down. And I seriously doubt that, Aarin. 
But you shouldn&#39;t worry about things like that. It&#39;s a good day. Lin-Lin 
is back home where she belongs. And the world is safe from whatever 
plans the Shougatsu have. Once the Neo World Federation enshrine these 
swords from the public; nothing like that will ever happen again.&quot;

Aarin cast his glare upon the Wind Soul, strapped to his waist. The Neo 
World Federation had decided that the swords must be buried away; never 
to be used again. They found the Shadow Edge within the ruins of 
Neuschwanstein Castle. Setsuya, Aarin and Ingrid had readily accepted 
that the swords be put to rest. They could not be destroyed but their 
power was too great for the world. It was better that way.

The young Aarin let a smile cross his lips. &quot;...I hope so.&quot;

Fifty Years Later...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Great Desert, Arabia

The past fifty years had been a blur for Diana Angelinous. She had felt 
like the whole of the earth was beyond her. Nothing felt the same 
anymore. Even though she had only been dead for three years before 
revival. The woman had escaped the fires of Neuschwanstein but for no 
reason other than the fact that she couldn&#39;t bare to stay there after 
Zephaniah died. She managed to savage his body and bury it in a secret 
gravesite back in Bristol, Neo-England. But no funeral was held for him. 
Diana did it all on her own. And burying that man she loved was the most 
haunting thing she had ever had to do. Ever since she did that; Diana 
had been a walking ghost.

She drifted from country to country like a phantom. No goal. No 
destination. Just travelling throughout Europe in the hopes of 
forgetting the death of her intended husband. But it obviously wasn&#39;t 
working. Diana had finally begun moving out of Europe and moving towards 
Asia. When she ended up in a huge place known only to the common folk as 
&#39;The Great Desert&#39;. Diana had found herself in this shabby shanty town 
that surrounded her presence. Full of poor people, foul-smelling homes 
and no hope. This was the kind of place that world was like outside of 
the Safe Zones. Diana held much hatred for it. It was one of the few 
emotions that Diana could still feel.

Hatred. 

The girl looked downward from the sight of the shanty town to the dusty 
ground below her, as she sat upon one of the ramshackle benches dotted 
around the town. She didn&#39;t look up until she felt a shadow being cast 
over her.

&quot;You must be... Diana Angelinous.&quot;

Her beautiful eyes looked upwards again. Someone who knew her? Standing 
above the girl was a tall man of Arabic Descent. He was aged, looking to 
be about 60 years of age; his light brown face covered with age marks 
and wrinkles. He was dressed in black and gold robes that were far 
richer in design than anything else that the people wore around here.

Diana spoke to this elderly man cautiously. &quot;W-Who... are you...?&quot;

&quot;My name is Al Gul Jehed...&quot; He replied, &quot;...and I have been waiting a 
long time to meet someone like you, Miss Angelinous...&quot;

Little did Diana know... this man called Al Gul Jehed was going to have 
an impact on the fate of the world as she knew it.

Scary&#39;s on the wall
Scary&#39;s on his way

Watch where you spit
I&#39;d advise you wait until it&#39;s over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better

And we die young
Faster we run

Down, down, down, you&#39;re rollin&#39;
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer
Take another hit
And bury your brother

And we die young
Faster we run

Scary&#39;s on the wall
Scary&#39;s on his way

Another alley trip
Bullet seek the place to bend you over
Then you got hit
And you shoulda known better

Faster we run
And we die young
