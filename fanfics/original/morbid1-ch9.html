Burnwell found himself lost amongst the wonders of life at the circus. 
Admittedly some of the attractions were far from interesting, for 
instance the illustrated woman who was so shy that she refused to show 
any of her tattoos off to the point of wearing a long dress and a veil 
to cover her body, and the bearded man that was covered in so much hair 
that it sent chills through Burnwell&#39;s spine. All the same Burnwell 
spend the entire night under the big top watching the many performers do 
their thing. Before long he had completely forgotten about his problems 
on the other side of the lake and he found himself exhausted and sat 
down at water&#39;s edge to watch some passing ducklings. Soon he found 
himself drifting off to sleep only to be rudely awoken by something 
prickling his side. 

&quot;HEY!!!&quot; The butler sat up straight to find a porcupine had brushed up 
against his side. Double quick he back peddled a fair distance from the 
creature before it felt like impaling him with those long quills. 
Burnwell clenched at his chest trying to will his heart to slow down as 
he watched the porcupine waddle off into some bushes. 

&quot;Are you alright there my friend?&quot; The Ring Master seemed to have 
appeared out of thin air and offered his hand to the butler. 

&quot;I just startled me is all, sir.&quot; Burnwell took Morbius&#39;s hand all the 
same and got to his feet, &quot;I didn&#39;t realize I&#39;d fallen asleep.&quot; He 
muttered in embarrassment. 

&quot;That is quite alright.&quot; Morbius assured with a grin, &quot;Did you enjoy the 
show?&quot; His grin was broadening. 

&quot;That I did, sir.&quot; Burnwell admitted, &quot;Is it alright if I look around 
some more?&quot; He inquired eagerly.

&quot;Go right ahead.&quot; Morbius patted the man on the back, &quot;You can roam 
around all you like. You are my personal guest after all. Do you like 
clowns?&quot; The ringmaster suddenly asked curiously.

&quot;Actually I do, sir.&quot; Burnwell confessed, once again he allowed himself 
to be lured back to the ring of tents. 

&quot;Well then you just have to meet Mister Titter.&quot; The ring master boosted 
as they wove their way through the tents, &quot;He is the most interesting of 
clown around and I&#39;ve seen a quite a few in my years.&quot;

&quot;Oh I see.&quot; Burnwell remarked intrigue to meet the man. 

&quot;I&#39;ll introduce you to him myself. He should be finished with his act by 
now.&quot; Morbius explain as they walked around another tent to find the 
bearded man running at them with a rather distressed look upon his face. 

&quot;Morbray sir, there is a problem.&quot; The man stated panting heavily. 

&quot;Not now Jacob.&quot; The ringmaster snapped, &quot;Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m escorting a 
guest. We are on our way to see Mister Titter. Is he finished with his 
act yet?&quot; 

&quot;That is the problem, sir.&quot; Jacob replied taking a deep breath, &quot;He has 
been attacked by his circus mice. He tired to get them to jump through 
the hoop and they turned on him and then the mice freed the tigers and 
well... He is cut up rather badly.&quot; 

&quot;I knew training mice was a worthless endeavour.&quot; Morbius stated letting 
out a disappointed sigh, &quot;Hopefully Mister Titter is not harmed to badly 
to perform. It is so hard to find a good clown these days.&quot; The three of 
them rushed to the big top back entrance. Morbius pushed his way through 
the crowd of circus performers to find a man lying on a stretcher. 
Minnie, a rather oversized diminutive diva the width of three men, was 
hovering over the man while holding his hand and tears in her eyes. 

&quot;How is he?&quot; Morbius asked Minnie. 

&quot;He is hurt, Mr. Morbray.&quot; Minnie stated with a mighty sob, &quot;Those mice 
were cruel. They didn&#39;t have to free the tigers.&quot; She blew her nose with 
a tiny handkerchief. 

Burnwell shoved his way to Morbius&#39;s side and gasped in horror. The 
clown was dressed in a colourful red and orange baggy clown outfit that 
hurt Charles&#39;s eyes when he first caught a glimpse of it. Parts of the 
outfit has been torn apart and there was a small pool of blood forming 
under the stretcher. However the most frightening things was his face. 
Most of the clowns skin was missing leaving rather skeletal feature, &quot;My 
lord what happened to his face?&quot; He asked in shook. 

&quot;Oh he always looked like that.&quot; Morbius admitted nonchalantly, &quot;Mister 
Titter, are you alright?&quot; He asked in distress.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine once Minnie stops sitting on my arm!&quot; The clown announced 
through a haze of pain. 

&quot;Oh!&quot; Minnie stood to her full height, which towered over the tallest of 
men nearly touching the roof of the tent, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry Titter.&quot; She 
apologized with a blush. 

The clown sat upright and brushed some of the blood off of his shirt, &quot;I 
just got this cleaned too.&quot; He muttered as he fixed his colourful clown 
wig upon his skull. 

Burnwell staggered backwards, &quot;Wait... you should be dead...&quot; He could 
not take his eyes off the clown&#39;s hideous face. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t notice?&quot; Morbius turned his eyes on Burnwell, &quot;Do you think 
Circuses just appear out of thin air?&quot; His eyes shifted to a sinister 
red glow. 

Burnwell turned to find himself surrounded by the circus performers. 
What he first saw as every day people had been replace with corpses 
pinned to poles. Several had their eyes gouged out or intestines hanging 
at their feet. The only people who were not pinned up were Morbius, Mr. 
Titter, Minnie and Jacob, who now looked like a werewolf, &quot;T...his 
can... not be happening.&quot; He stammered as he stumbled backwards bumping 
into a hanging foot and batting it away. 

Minnie stepped forwards, &quot;You should have thought of that before joining 
us.&quot; She giggles. 

The butler fled from the tent and for the first time he noticed that all 
the tents were in tatters and there were several dead bodies laying 
about. One of them had his head in the peanut machine that Burnwell had 
only recently ordered from. The sight made his stomach turn, &quot;What is 
going on around here?&quot; His eyes turned to the sky above as they turned 
an awful shade of red and the clouds circled above the town.

&quot;It is almost time.&quot; Morbius announced with glee, &quot;Soon we shall no 
longer be bound by this annoying circus.&quot; His laughter filled the air 
causing bird to scatter to the winds.
