Marissa Wainright thought she recognized the young warrior who went up 
against Pandora in the first round, and when the announcer called her 
name, Inferno, she was almost certain. Seeing her up close confirmed it: 
it was her friend from the lab, Hsu Kai Lin! As soon as she could, 
Marissa put everything on hold and ran over to the younger girl, calling 
her name out as she dashed.

&quot;Kailin! Kailin!!&quot; The sensation of hearing one&#39;s name called by a 
familiar voice&#151;Hsu turned, gasped in surprise, and ran after Marissa, 
whom she recognized instantly. They crashed and embraced so hard that it 
was almost painful; they wept and called out each other&#39;s names, too 
happy to do anything else except hold each other and burst with joy.

&quot;You&#39;re safe! I&#39;m so glad!&quot;

&quot;I know, and you finally got out of there!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I did. Wow. It&#39;s amazing to see you again. I never thought 
we&#39;d...oh, Hsu!&quot; They embraced again&#151;Kailin giggled just a little&#151;and 
sighed as they calmed down at last. Both Rin and Rancor watched the 
reunion out of the corner of their eye, and decided not to get involved. 
They had never heard of the other girl, but any friend of their friend 
was welcome.

&quot;So what have you been up to?&quot; asked Marissa happily, taking Kailin to 
the side.

&quot;Lots. Did you hear about that lab exploding?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, the reports said it was arson.&quot;

&quot;The reports were only...slightly off.&quot; She smiled mischievously; 
Marissa wouldn&#39;t need her telekinesis to figure out what she meant.

&quot;You did that?&quot; she gasped. Kailin grinned.

&quot;Well, not all of it. Rin helped me. We went back for you too, but you 
weren&#39;t there. Did you escape?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...well, actually, I was taken away by this guy named Mr. White. He 
took me to this really strange place and let me stay there. I&#39;ve made a 
few friends, one of whom just won over that girl, and the 
others...should...be around here somewhere.&quot; She stood on her toes and 
peeked over the crowd, but there was no luck&#151;said friends were nowhere 
to be found.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll catch up soon. Oh, I want to introduce you to my 
friends. First, Rin&#151;that loud girl over there.&quot; Marissa looked and saw a 
young woman older than Kailin but younger than herself, wearing strange 
blue samurai armor, her inky hair in a topknot, hakama pants, and for 
the moment, tinted goggles. She was shouting at the action in the ring, 
ignorant of everything else; Kailin rolled her eyes.

&quot;My next little buddy is a lot cuter. Say hello to Captain Cuddles!&quot; 
Reaching into her pack, she pulled out whatever was left of BaoBao, to 
Marissa&#39;s delight. The majority of the panda had been wasted on naps, a 
constantly cramped space, little food, and far too much noise. She 
growled and yawned, and found cuddling next to Marissa was much better 
than the little sack Kailin usually stuffed her in.

&quot;He&#39;s so cu&#151;&quot;

&quot;She.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry. Uh, she&#39;s cute. Captain Cuddles, right? Unusual, but it 
fits. So soft!&quot; The two girls shared beautiful laughter as Marissa and 
the panda made fast friends (apparently she reminded her nothing of 
Rin). Once BaoBao was given something to chew on, Marissa attended to 
her old friend again.

&quot;I have a few friends with me today as well, as I&#39;ve said. That woman in 
the tournament is Rancor. The others are Lurker and Venom, and there are 
more back where I live. I&#39;ll introduce you once I find them&#151;now where 
the heck are they?&quot; She stood on her toes again, vainly searching for 
the girls, not knowing whether they were getting into trouble, drawing 
unwanted attention, or worse.

......

Julie Smith, the Lurker, was not in trouble nor drawing attention nor 
anything else, just lost. Now in the Iron Arena Games, people of all 
different physical forms came and went, some stranger than the 
green-skinned, white-haired, red-eyed &quot;monster&quot; wandering around 
aimlessly, so it was an unusual sensation to be out of the center of 
attention for once. Julie liked it so much, she pranced around and 
completely missed some of the big fights, and now she was exploring to 
her heart&#39;s content. She met a few people who stared, and some men who 
apparently saw past her looks (they made passes), but was unseen by 
those she was looking for.

&quot;Excuse me, are you lost?&quot; Hearing a kind voice, Julie stepped around 
and saw a slightly older girl&#151;pretty, with her dark hair parted in the 
middle, wearing a purple top that left her midriff wide open and black 
everywhere else. Her skin was light brown except for an area beneath her 
eyes, which had suddenly turned red. Julie grinned.

&quot;Yes, yes! I am the Lost.&quot; Of course, her answer didn&#39;t exactly fit the 
question, but the other girl understood. She gaped and stared, perhaps a 
bit rudely, and stuttered to try and get some words out.

&quot;Um...oh my. Uh...hi, uh...were you, uh...were you looking for 
somebody?&quot;

&quot;Friends, friends,&quot; sang Julie, &quot;many friends have I here, here, where 
are the friends? And thee, thistle, where is my whistle, you, who, art 
thou oh who?&quot;

&quot;I...wow. What language&quot; The girl grinned, plainly flustered, and bowed 
several times. She had never seen anything so...utterly beautiful in all 
her life. Simple and...clean. Like a soft green towel, warm from a day 
in the sun...

&quot;Lang which? Which lang? I am not a lang. I&#39;m Julie. 
Julie-Lurker-Smith.&quot;

&quot;Julie...Lurkersmith?&quot;

&quot;Yes-yes. And you?&quot; The girl smiled.

&quot;Uh...Kris...uh...I mean, BK Power.&quot;

&quot;Beekay. Long, long, sounds like beaker, long nice name, sounds good to 
the ear. Beekay!&quot; Julie giggled and waved; BK Power blushed, unable to 
look away. The girl was just so...gorgeous to her eyes. So utterly 
gorgeous. And she...could not...do...anything.

&quot;Julie...Lurkersmith. It&#39;s a pleasure...to meet you.&quot;

&quot;Pleasures everywhere when Beekay is here.&quot; Masterson stifled a grin.

&quot;Uh, yeah.&quot;

&quot;There you are!&quot; Julie grunted as she was grabbed by someone older, 
taller, more distinguishable&#151;apparently a caretaker. She howled and 
scratched her silky white hair, laughed, and pointed to her friend.

&quot;Namie! Sounds that make when you touch, too much! Meet Beekay, Lurker&#39;s 
new friend. Julie, Lurkersmith, I like this one. Pretty and she says my 
name in a nice way.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; said the one called Namie, clutching onto Julie&#39;s wrists. &quot;She 
makes such mischief everywhere she goes, but the girl&#39;s completely 
harmless. I&#39;m so sorry if she bothered you.&quot;

&quot;Um...no,&quot; managed &quot;Beekay&quot;, &quot;not at all, it was...a pleasure.&quot;

&quot;Pleasure!!&quot; howled Julie merrily. &quot;Pleasure for all! Good to meet you, 
good to meet me. Good for all.&quot;

&quot;Yes-yes,&quot; sighed Namie wearily, &quot;and soon we&#39;ll all make no sense if we 
hang around you, dear. Come&#151;God knows what we&#39;ve missed already. Sorry 
once again.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot; BK Power waved farewell&#151;Julie was the only one who waved 
back&#151;and when they were gone, she sighed and composed herself. Whew! Was 
that really love at first sight? Such a strange girl, too! Strange, and 
innocent, and incomparably beautiful. Kristen, in truth, had a secret 
love of the color green; she kept her walls that color and had once dyed 
her hair like emeralds. And that hair...the white hair that must&#39;ve been 
so smooth and fuzzy...

&quot;Get a hold, girl,&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;It&#39;s just a stranger. 
It&#39;s not like you&#39;ll meet her again.&quot;

......

Marissa had no idea why, but she was being drawn towards that strange 
combatant that her friend had defeated&#151;that &quot;Sanaa&quot; girl. She didn&#39;t 
know why. Was it because, in that crowded coliseum, she was off by 
herself, leaning up against a wall, silently reading? Was it because she 
had spoken to Marissa, and Merry accused them of flirting? Was it 
because she had a good body, a standoffish demeanor, or a mind that 
couldn&#39;t be easily read by the standard psychic evaluation? Maybe it was 
dumb curiosity, but whatever the case, Miss Wainright found herself 
right next to the loner.

&quot;...Hi,&quot; she said with a meek smile. Sanaa quickly marked her place and 
waved. &quot;Um, Sanaa, right? Is that your full name?&quot;

&quot;Do you always begin conversations this way?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Marissa grinned bashfully, &quot;I&#39;m not used to...um...never mind, 
sorry. So what&#39;re you reading?&quot;

&quot;Just something I brought from home. A second-rate story I never 
finished.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I like to read.&quot;

&quot;A lot of people do.&quot; She returned to the book, sensing the conversation 
was over. Poor Marissa floundered.

&quot;So what are you doing here? I heard you work with the sponsor of the 
games, Dr. Kamaguchi.&quot;

&quot;Not with, just for. She&#39;s helping me regain my lost identity in 
exchange for favors such as this. I didn&#39;t expect to get far, but I 
didn&#39;t expect to lose in the first match either. But not much I can do 
against a girl who can turn her skin into armor.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...my friend.&quot;

&quot;I picked that up.&quot; She pointed to her ears, then returned to the book 
again. Marissa once more found herself speechless.

&quot;You said something about your lost identity?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s private territory.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to. It&#39;s just...I don&#39;t quite know who I am 
either.&quot;

&quot;Welcome to the world of the living.&quot; She closed her book and looked 
like she was ready to move on. &quot;If you&#39;ll excuse me. I&#39;d like to see if 
I can finish my book, and I can&#39;t read unless I have silence.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Uh...sorry. Oh! My name&#39;s Marissa.&quot;

&quot;Not that I&#39;ll really need it, but okay.&quot; She waved lamely, and was 
gone, moving with exceptional speed. Marissa grimaced, feeling glum over 
what she believed to be a lost cause. Well, perhaps she couldn&#39;t make 
friends with everyone she met. She still had Kailin and the so-called 
Lost Girls, after all.

Still. Sanaa lingered in her mind like a song stuck in her head. She 
would have to ask Shalis for some favors once she came back home.

.........

&quot;Welcome back, one and all! I, William the Cat, am so excited to see 
everyone here, ready for the semifinals! And after that, the match that 
will determine this year&#39;s champion! WHO WILL IT BE?!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so hard to tell!&quot; exclaimed Bonnie. &quot;We&#39;ve seen lots of great 
fighters today! First, we have Siren, an awesome young woman who, I&#39;m 
told, can manipulate spiritual energy itself! Next there&#39;s Pandora the 
Gambler, a mysterious character who uses chance to gain the upper hand 
over her opponents! On the other side is Rancor, a woman whose rock-hard 
skin has dominated the competition, and Snowblood, the savage and 
beautiful psychic girl. I can&#39;t decide who I like more, Willy!&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s not wait anymore! First up is Siren versus Pandora! Let the 
match begin!&quot; The crowd roared, and the two semifinalists climbed into 
the ring, neither of them basking shamelessly in the adoration. They 
were fixed solely on each other: Pandora studying her doomed opponent, 
Siren staring the older woman down. Cobra had mentioned earlier that her 
ex-lover had let her eyes wander far too much over the Gambler, but 
Siren couldn&#39;t help it. There was just something about that woman that 
allured her...

&quot;So what&#39;re you looking at?&quot; she demanded. Siren blinked and shook her 
head, unaware that she had been staring still.

&quot;Um, nothing. May the best woman win.&quot;

&quot;You gotta be kidding me!&quot; Pandora scoffed and shook her head; Alyssa 
didn&#39;t know why. As it turned out, when she shook her head, the 
eyeball-sized Magic 8-Ball lodged in her socket rattled around a small 
fortune, and like its larger counterpart, relayed that fortune to its 
user. Pandora&#39;s large roulette wheel strapped to her back would then 
light up and spin; where it landed was largely due to the 8-Ball&#39;s 
decision, although the Ball itself had more of an influence over 
Pandora&#39;s performance in battle. That it had foreseen victory the past 
two times was no small miracle, for it was as fickle as fate itself.

The Gambler grinned. &quot;Absolution,&quot; she declared, knowing exactly what 
her prophesying prosthetic had told her. The roulette wheel came to 
life, as it always did, and Siren found herself temporarily unable to 
move, perhaps stricken with amazement. The light finally stopped 
spinning and landed on one of the large options: hand-to-hand combat. 
Pandora grinned, pleased with the fates&#39; answer, and unfolded the staff 
attached to her wrist. It was really more like a spear, with a blade at 
the end; she twirled it around with the dexterity of a pro. Alyssa met 
the challenge with her sword.

Okay, so I kind of have a crush on this woman, she admitted to herself. 
That doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m giving her this victory. ...She does have really 
sexy hair, though&#151;GAH! What am I thinking?! They circled each other 
carefully, like lionesses fighting over a downed zebra, studying and 
seeking out weaknesses. Alyssa felt somehow unable to concentrate&#151;her 
powers were much less responsive than before&#151;and Pandora seemed to grow 
stronger. She grinned and lunged, catching Siren off guard, and the 
spear-staff plunged right into arm.

Not one to take a blow without retribution, Siren absorbed the attack, 
refusing to scream, and slashed with her sword, cutting Pandora&#39;s arm. 
The older woman jumped back, and now both damsels were bleeding, nearly 
in the same place. They clutched their arms and stared at their 
opponents with new feelings, and new handicaps.

&quot;No matter,&quot; Pandora murmured, switching the staff to her other arm. 
&quot;I&#39;m ambidextrous.&quot;

&quot;That makes two of us,&quot; Siren countered. They went after each other in 
earnest this time, swiping and slashing madly, neither having much grace 
or style. It was somewhat reminiscent of the Rin-Snowblood match, only 
these two didn&#39;t seem to have the finesse nor the noticeable dominating 
strengths. They just fought, and fought madly. Blood spewed out with 
every blow that went undefended. Bruises came when bone and flesh 
collided. Bodies tumbled as they were tossed or pushed. Pandora always 
seemed to take longer than Siren to stand.

Their match went on and on, fascinating viewers and judges alike, who 
had not seen a full-on battle drag for so long, at least not without the 
two opposing sides agreeing to a rest. The audience ate it up; Siren&#39;s 
friends chewed their lips and clenched their fists with hope; Dr. 
Kamaguchi stood in her skybox, a crafty smile decorating her face. She 
had faith in her warrior-friend; she knew what the outcome would have to 
be. Of course, since she was the only one...

&quot;I don&#39;t know what the outcome will be!&quot; shouted Bonnie. &quot;Will it be 
Siren? No, Pandora! No wait&#151;Siren! Pandora! Ack, they seem to be 
evenly-matched, and who knows how far they can take this! They&#39;re really 
going the distance here, folks!&quot;

&quot;Siren is giving it all she&#39;s got!&quot; continued William. &quot;But Pandora 
refuses to back down! How can these two beautiful warriors keep on going 
after each other after all they&#39;ve been through?! It boggles the mind, I 
tell you folks! And here comes a&#151;OOOH!! Ouch! Ladies and gentlemen, I 
don&#39;t care how tough you are, that has got to hurt! Pandora just smashed 
her weapon on Siren&#39;s forehead, sending the woman tumbling to the ground 
like a logged redwood! She&#39;s down for the count! I repeat, it&#39;s a total 
knockout! The woman is unconscious! Pandora wins! Pandora wins!&quot;

......

Alyssa&#39;s wounds were fixed by Naoma, but her stasis would take longer to 
recover. Her friends took her in and nursed her, each one battling the 
emotions of relief and disappointment: relief that she was okay, 
disappointed that none of the Divas would be in the finals. Siren came 
to after the second semifinal fight concluded, and turned ill as she 
contemplated over what kind of horrors the last match would bring. 
Pandora had looked so wicked when she glared at her and struck her down, 
like she was enjoying it, or worse&#151;like she was trying to kill her. But 
why? Siren had never done anything bad to her.

She had worn that same jackal&#39;s smile when she fought Inferno and 
Bloodbane, almost as if she had something against every single one of 
them. But what?

Lady Snowblood didn&#39;t think she stood much of a chance against 
Rancor&#151;not because she doubted her skills, but because she was so 
confident of her opponent&#39;s. Merry Weathers could toughen her hide at 
will, rendering even the strongest blows useless. Snowblood wasn&#39;t 
exactly a powerhouse warrior either&#151;all she had was the unusual ability 
to predict her opponent&#39;s next move, but what good would that do against 
a woman who could just sit there and take it? And even if she did win, 
there was Pandora to consider. All of her matches had been won because 
of that roulette machine and (though nobody knew it at the time) the 
prosthetic 8-Ball in her right eye.

&quot;Hey, Snowblood!&quot; Blind as she was, she could tell it was Rin.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Rin ran up as close as she could come and shouted to her.

&quot;If you lose, you can forget about killing me! I could kick that 
Rancor&#39;s ass any day of the month! So what kind of an opponent would you 
be if you lost?&quot; Snowblood cracked a smile, at long last, and even 
chuckled.

&quot;May you never lose that fighting spirit of yours.&quot;

&quot;Just kick her ass, okay?&quot; Rin gave her a thumbs-up that would never be 
seen, but her encouraging words were enough. Snowblood faced her 
opponent with a new resolve, and determined that she would be the victor 
no matter the cost. But how to beat her? Surely she had a weakness&#151;every 
armor has its chink, her old grandmother had told her. She just had to 
find it...

Two places? One at the right thigh, the other underneath her left arm...

She would have to rely on her clairvoyance to be her guide. No problem.

She felt the aura of defenses being raised around her opponent. She 
sensed, though they were small, the two weak spots in Merry&#39;s armor. She 
felt the ground tremble as the armored woman slowly lumbered towards 
her. Snowblood was glad she had sacrificed power for speed, for what 
good was strength when one&#39;s enemy could outrun it? She followed the two 
tiny beacons like a bat, and before Merry could raise her heavy arms, 
she struck twice, once on each of the weak spots&#151;and for good measure, 
she stabbed the one in her thigh. Merry cried out in pain and lowered 
her defenses so she could attend to her bleeding leg. Snowblood 
honorably backed off.

&quot;What the hell did you do to me?!&quot; demanded the tall, pink-haired one. 
&quot;I thought I was invincible!&quot;

&quot;Such thoughts alone will lead to your downfall. I determined you had 
weaknesses, and exploited them.&quot; Merry fumed so much that Snowblood 
could almost feel her rage with her fingertips. She stood again, making 
a few members in the audience gasp and whisper: Uh-oh. Miss Weathers was 
about ready to demonstrate why she bore that violent nickname of hers.

She donned her armor again, making it thin enough so she could move 
around comfortably, but something else was added that nobody knew about: 
rows and rows of small, sharp spikes poked out from the hard skin, 
making it all the more difficult to strike her. Snowblood did not know 
about this, of course, but she could sense the danger. Rancor charged 
after her like a raging bull; Snowblood dove to the side, but a simple 
slap raked numerous scars across her body. She rolled along the ground, 
spreading streaks of blood, and got up only to assess the damage.

Avoid touching her, her premonition spoke. No, really?

But Snowblood had a plan. Merry was fast now, which meant her defenses 
were only so-so. If she were well-protected, she would barely move at 
all. This too was a weakness of hers, and Snowblood once again decided 
to exploit it. She waited for the enraged woman to come around and chase 
after her again, and just as she was within touching distance, Snowblood 
jumped&#151;scraping herself against the spikes&#151;twisted in the air, and 
smashed her walking stick against the back of Merry&#39;s neck so hard that 
it shattered.

And apparently, so did Merry&#39;s chances of making it to the finals. She 
was floored, and she did not get back up, not even after the referee 
counted to ten.

&quot;Merry!&quot; G-Force pushed aside friends and security alike to check up on 
her new girlfriend, and felt her pulse before anyone else. Thankfully, 
it was still there&#151;the blow had not killed her. She was gently ushered 
away by the resident healer, who assured her that there was no wound, 
fatal or otherwise, she could not heal. Naoma bent down over the fallen 
warrior and touched her neck, mending it with her glowing hands. It took 
one minute for Rancor to recover and sit up; a sigh of relief came out 
of more than one person&#39;s mouth.

So, it was going to be Pandora versus Snowblood in the finals.

......

&quot;This is the moment you&#39;ve been waiting for, folks! Two fighters who 
require no introduction, who have both waded through countless forces of 
opposition, now together to determine who is the greatest!&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s not torture them anymore, William! Let&#39;s go right to the main 
event! Ladies and gentlemen! Are YOU READY TO RUMBLE?!&quot; The crowd went 
wild, the gong sounded, and the two warriors leaped into the ring, 
prepared to battle it out in what promised to be a glorious spectacle. 
Snowblood had been given a new weapon for the final fight; she stood 
poised with it, determined to be the one to debilitate Pandora at last. 
After all, a woman who gambled constantly surely had an equally strong 
weakness.

Pandora shook her head and grinned, at least until the 8-Ball gave her a 
fortune.

&quot;Outlook terrible?&quot; she blurted. The roulette wheel spun around, as it 
always did&#151;Snowblood waited patiently, wanting to fight this woman at 
her best&#151;but she never got the chance. The light stopped, of all places, 
on Retreat. &quot;What?! NO!!!&quot; Before Pandora could stop herself, the 
bandoliers tied around her shot out a gush of steam and air so powerful, 
it blew her backwards, out of the ring and straight into the wall.

Which meant, of course, that Lady Snowblood had won.

Just like that.

Needless to say, everybody was surprised.

&quot;...Oh my,&quot; said Bonnie, plainly stunned. &quot;It seems as if our would-be 
champion had a run of bad luck at the last second. I hate to say this, 
but it looks as if the fight&#39;s over before it began! Lady Snowblood wins 
by default!&quot; The crowd naturally went ballistic with rage, booing and 
hissing madly. They didn&#39;t care about the winner&#151;for all they knew, if 
Snowblood had genuinely beaten Pandora, it was just as good&#151;they just 
wanted to see blood. Shocked, and speechless, Snowblood shakily walked 
out of the arena (knowing that Rin would be aggravated), and stood numb 
as she was given a laurel wreath, a trophy, and...and...

&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; exclaimed William. &quot;Where the hell&#39;s the prize money?! 
Bonnie, what did you do with it!?&quot;

&quot;Why are you asking me? I&#39;m not the one in charge of it!&quot;

&quot;Something&#39;s wrong! Search for it! Find it! Don&#39;t give up until it&#39;s 
found!&quot;

Meanwhile, a young, feminine person was grinning ear to ear as they 
presented Dr. Kamaguchi with the prize money.

&quot;Well done, Ferret,&quot; she said, giving them an embrace. &quot;You see? I told 
you you&#39;d have a use. Naturally, I was hoping to win this legally, but 
no matter. You have proved your worth by far today. Who knows, I may 
trade in those others for you.&quot;

&quot;You flatter me, doctor,&quot; said Ferret with a grin. &quot;It was no big deal. 
I&#39;ve swiped bigger things than this. So what&#39;s my cut?&quot;

&quot;As much as you can carry in one hand.&quot; Ferret seemed satisfied, and 
since large masses of money would look suspicious in those pockets 
anyway, a sizeable wad was stuffed inside, and once the rest of 
Kamaguchi&#39;s team came around, the money was divided just as evenly. 
Yohko sighed as they left the arena, undetected and undisturbed. &quot;Well,&quot; 
she reasoned, &quot;this should certainly compensate for what I put into this 
thing. Sayonada should be pleased too. After all, without him, none of 
us would be here.&quot;

The case of the missing prize money was never solved.

But those who parted ways with friends, adversaries, and enemies would 
soon be brought together again.

Very soon.

To be continued.

Mora: ...I can honestly say I didn&#39;t see that coming.

Alyssa: Uh...yeah...

Mora: Well, with that over with, our team goes back to its temple, but 
there&#39;s no R&amp;R for this group! The Battle Divas are attacked by a hoard 
of enemies on their own turf before they even have time to unpack!

Alyssa: WHAT? No way! I gotta get a shower first!

Mora: We&#39;ll have to put the pleasantries on hold, Siren. There&#39;s some 
enemies to whack! Please stay tuned for the next part of our story, 
&quot;Battle Diva Rumble&quot;.

Alyssa: It&#39;s so exciting, we&#39;re required to give you time to brace 
yourselves!</pre>
