<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>&quot;What do you mean, you&#39;re dropping the case?&quot; Alice Sinclair looked
faintly surprised as she talked into the phone. The well dressed
black haired woman kept the cellphone by her ear as she served a
customer, ringing up her books with a smile.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t quite put it that way,&quot; Lucy Yamazaki said a bit stiffly
in reply, &quot;I just think that we&#39;ve exhausted our avenues of enquiry.
If you like I can fax over our report right now, as well as a bill
for our services.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Alice agreed, silently wondering why Lucy seemed to be
so uncomfortable. &quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; she finished and hung
up.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot; Hunter asked her as the sandy blonde restocked
the bookmarks and pins in their display up front.

&quot;You remember that private investigator I told you I was hiring?&quot;
Alice said as she went over to the fax machine, &quot;She&#39;s finished her
check on Jess.&quot; With a soft whir of machinery the sheets came out of
the fax, five of them piling up neatly.

&quot;You serious?&quot; Hunter instinctively moved to go take a look at the
papers, then she visibly stopped herself.

&quot;What?&quot; Alice blinked as she sorted the papers in order.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to know,&quot; Hunter admitted.

Alice flipped through them thoughtfullly, scanning the contents
while feeling relieved they were in what she thought of as the early
afternoon break. Unless it was a regular, they&#39;d be alone here for
awhile. &quot;I don&#39;t think you have much to worry about,&quot; she
said, &quot;there&#39;s not much here.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Hunter looked at the pages.

&quot;Jess Drake, probable alias,&quot; Alice snorted, &quot;Like I didn&#39;t guess
that. Place of residence, business licence, know associates....&quot;

&quot;This is interesting,&quot; Hunter pointed to a line on the first page.

&quot;Firearms licence?&quot; Alice blinked, mildly surprised. She wouldn&#39;t
have expected Jess to use guns, in all honesty. She kept skimming
the page, face paling when she hit the criminal record
section, &quot;Charged with murder?&quot;

&quot;And dropped less than three weeks later,&quot; Hunter pointed out. She
looked thoughtful, &quot;Wonder if that&#39;s where she met the medical
examiner?&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Alice finished the front then went to the next
page. She flipped through the pages then shook her head wryly, &quot;It
looks like they just compiled all the rumors about Jess and put them
in the right order.&quot;

&quot;At least they made a note of which one&#39;s they could verify,&quot; Hunter
offered.

&quot;That&#39;s something,&quot; Alice agreed.

&quot;Did you notice the way they traced her movements?&quot; Hunter said
tentatively as she gestured to the last page.

&quot;Home, work, the gym and Daughters,&quot; Alice tapped the sheet
thoughtfully.

&quot;Unless Jess is very good at having quickie sex she isn&#39;t sleeping
around on you,&quot; Hunter said softly. A sigh, &quot;Hell, according to this
she isn&#39;t doing much at all.&quot;

Alice felt a surge of relief she coundn&#39;t quite deny. Some part of
her had been expecting Jess to go wild, sleeping around while they
were apart but instead she was living like a nun. &quot;I just wish I
knew what to do now,&quot; Alice sighed.

Hunter looked at her a moment then sighed softly. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying
to stay out of this,&quot; she admitted, &quot;you&#39;re both my friends.&quot;

&quot;But...?&quot; Alice smiled faintly.

Hunter smiled gently as she warned, &quot;You aren&#39;t going to like
hearing this, but did you ever tell Jess what you expected when you
and she started dating?&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; Alice admitted, &quot;I guess I thought I didn&#39;t have to.&quot;

&quot;Jess comes from a very different world than you do, and it&#39;s not
just the magic,&quot; Hunter said as she leaned up against the counter.

&quot;So in her world sleeping around on someone is okay?&quot; Alice frowned.

&quot;No, it wasn&#39;t okay,&quot; Hunter said to her gently, &quot;but did Jess
really know that you expected her to be exclusive?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Alice admitted.

&quot;Even some of our regulars here have open relationships or practice
some form of non-monogamy, partner,&quot; Hunter actually smirked as she
cheerfully boasted, &quot;trust me, I know from first hand experience.&quot;

Alice rolled her eyes, &quot;You scare me at times, you know that?&quot;

Hunter snickered.

Alice sighed. &quot;I guess I should at least see Jess, huh? It wouldn&#39;t
hurt to talk and...,&quot; she smiled as she admitted, &quot;I miss her.&quot;

&quot;I bet she does you, too.&quot; Hunter smiled gently, &quot;If you want to go,
I can keep an eye on the store for awhile.&quot;

Alice straightened up, determination showing in her eyes. &quot;Thanks,&quot;
she said with a smile, going to the back to grab her coat. As Alice
shrugged the garment on she added, &quot;Don&#39;t get into trouble while I&#39;m
gone.&quot;

&quot;Would I do that?&quot; Hunter purred.

&quot;The mind boggles,&quot; was Alice&#39;s amused answer.

The city street was bustling as Alice left, a bounce in her step for
the first time in weeks. The walk to the tattoo parlor took her from
the edge of the hip brownstones to the bad side of town, the
occassional hooker standing on corners and drunks sleeping it off in
doorways. Still she wasn&#39;t too frightened, as far as it went, having
made this trip more than once over the past several months.

With a faint smile Alice paused at the window to the tattoo parlor,
noticing a few new images had been added. &quot;Going to complain about
them again?&quot; the voice asked tentatively.

Alice turned, looking up at Jess Drake with a faint smile. &quot;Oh I
don&#39;t know,&quot; she answered, &quot;I thought things went pretty well the
first time, considering.&quot;

Jess smiled back tentatively, &quot;It&#39;s good to see you, Alice.&quot;

Alice saw how Jess wanted to get close but held herself back and
felt a surprising rush of tenderness. &quot;You, too,&quot; she said gently.

Jess turned away a moment, looking at the display of her art
work. &quot;I never had the chance to say I&#39;m sorry....&quot; she started,
then trailed off. A sigh, &quot;I&#39;m not very good at this.&quot;

&quot;What, relationships?&quot; Alice looked over at her curiously.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jess nodded. She took a deep breath and confessed, &quot;I&#39;ve
missed you... more than anything I&#39;ve ever experienced.&quot;

Alice reached out, taking her hand and squeezing slightly. &quot;Do you
normally date more than one woman at a time?&quot; she asked, her voice
surprisingly gentle.

Jess winced visibly. &quot;I used to,&quot; she said frankly, &quot;when the women
I was dating didn&#39;t matter to me. After I met you, that began to
change.&quot;

Alice nodded, thinking about things as they stood together outside
the shop. &quot;I think I&#39;ve gotten over my anger, but I&#39;m still hurt,&quot;
she said softly.

&quot;If I could undo it, I would,&quot; Jess said softly.

&quot;I think we all feel like that at times,&quot; Alice agreed. She smiled
at Jess, &quot;I&#39;d like to try again, but I... Hunter suggested I tell
you what I expect, more or less.&quot;

Jess chuckled softly, &quot;She&#39;s a good friend, I think.&quot; She gestured
to the shop as she said gentlemanly, &quot;Would you care to join me
inside for tea?&quot;

Alice took the offered arm and said, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;</pre>
