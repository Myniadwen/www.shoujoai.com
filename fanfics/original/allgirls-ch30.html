&quot;Crown of Light&quot;

Corona De Luz Marcos lay awake for a long time, breathing unevenly in 
long, frightened gasps. Her fingers curled around her sheets like claws, 
her body frozen stiff for ages. Her heart paced frantically. Another 
nightmare&#151;another. That had been the second one that night. It had been 
too gruesome to endure, so she forced herself to wake, 4:53 at night, 
mere hours before her first class in Stanton. She wished she could never 
go to sleep again. She shook herself and gradually, slowly, bit by bit, 
she relaxed and breathed normally. It was 4:57 now; her alarm would go 
off in two hours. She took another breath and tried to lay quietly, but 
her dreams had jarred her too deeply. She had no choice but to wake.

For the fifth night in a row, Corona failed to get a full night&#39;s sleep. 
Dreams came to her often, no matter what she ate or how stimulated her 
mind was, and more often than not they were terrible. War, torture, 
suffering, damnation, horrible violence... it happened so often in her 
most defenseless hours, where she should&#39;ve been resting, but now, as 
she had so many times before, she was awake long before sunrise and 
walking around, trying to occupy herself&#151;trying to silence her thoughts. 
She would be early for school, but she would be groggy and snappy all 
day for it.

She had once tried to forcibly silence the nightmares forever, but that 
ended her up in a worse situation than before. As penance, she would 
have to pay her debts, to suffer, to endure it, until insanity claimed 
her as it had claimed her mother, nine years before, or else death, as 
it had taken her father.

When her alarm went off at 7:00, she was already fed, washed, dressed, 
and ready to go. School wouldn&#39;t start for an hour; the bus she took 
would be there in three-fourths the time. With forty minutes to spare, 
she dug through her backpack and completed whatever homework assignments 
she had been ignoring. Then, she began to write a little, and draw the 
characters in her stories, and made up some poems and songs to sing. Her 
creative outlet relieved the madness considerably&#151;having something good 
to concentrate on always made her feel better&#151;and in no time at all, she 
left her tiny house she shared with her older brother, made it to the 
bus, and prepared herself for another day.

She leaned her head against the bus window as it rolled towards her 
school. Bumps and sharp turns were nothing new; she could handle them. 
The chill was something different, for autumn was approaching and the 
cool air of the morning already bore telltale signs. Trees turned rusty. 
Flowers wilted or went into hiding. Birds frequented the branches less. 
Geese honked as they flew overhead. Her breath didn&#39;t make ghosts yet, 
as she sighed on the windowpane, but it would. Nobody sat next to her, 
unless they had to. She began to think about somebody she knew at 
Stanton; her thoughts drifted deep until the bus arrived.

Corona was a somber, quiet type, who never attached herself to anyone or 
gave them many emotions to pleasure in; she was a cold, distant young 
woman in a shell, reluctant to come out unless by the guidance of an 
affectionate and nurturing person, which was unlikely considering how 
many people strayed from Corona&#39;s path. The people at Stanton were 
&quot;nice&quot;, and some certainly seemed like the type who could calm her 
dreams and return her namesake to her, but of course, many of them 
already had lovers.

Mostly, Corona had noted, female lovers.

She never believed herself capable of falling for someone from the same 
&quot;side&quot;, but lovers were lovers and she would take what she could.

Corona had Miss Raulson for history and Ms. McGowen for science because 
graduation required their courses; Mrs. Keys for art and Miss Johansson 
for music due to her innate talents; and Ms. Keeping for psychology, 
for... obvious reasons. In most of these classes, she kept to herself 
and only spoke out when necessary (except during music, where she loved 
singing; she even had a few fans in-class), but in psychology, she 
poured herself out to Ms. Keeping, who despite her training and amicable 
relationships with her students, found Marcos&#39; case a difficult one. She 
had spent several hours after school speaking with the troubled girl, 
and while her efforts seemed uplifting, they still couldn&#39;t help the 
poor girl.

It was in Janet Keys&#39; art class where Corona found the most liberation. 
The middle-aged woman was more of a matron than her own mother had been, 
and combined with Keeping&#39;s appointments and Johansson&#39;s sessions, 
Corona&#39;s sanity seemed to be at a norm. Keys not only endured the young 
girl&#39;s unusual traits, she encouraged her to express them through her 
work. Her art was usually dark, lonesome, and bleak, but Keys loved it. 
Corona quickly learned to trust the motherly art teacher, and met with 
her several times a week after school to talk.

Most of Keys&#39; students had similar talents in art, and Corona respected 
and even liked a few. Amina Washim was a natural sketch artist, and had 
had Marcos as a model several times in the past. Lilian Nachtheim, as 
quiet and reserved as Corona, made haunting drawings and paintings that 
seemed to reflect other worlds, and sometimes the two girls collaborated 
on more Gothic projects. Hero Love was fun and wild&#151;Corona really didn&#39;t 
like her exuberance&#151;and Ana Lu was too bubbly and goofy to endure, but 
her so-called girlfriend Rai was easier to get along with.

Corona was loose friends with Olivia, whose problems seemed to pale in 
the wake of the Hispanic&#39;s traumas. Olivia&#39;s dour mood always did 
lighten around Corona, but then again, everyone seemed a bit happier and 
brighter with her around. Perhaps Corona acted as a sort of vacuum, 
sucking up negative energy and storing it in her own mind, so that while 
everyone else got brighter in her presence, she became darker still. 
Perhaps this negative energy was the source of her nightmares, or else 
God just felt like playing cruel jokes on her (hence her atheism). Ms. 
Keeping, reasonable and sharp, preferred the first theory over the 
second.

&quot;Do you really think it&#39;s my lot in life to make other people happy, 
while I continue to remain depressed?&quot; Corona had asked once. Keeping 
had stuck a pencil in her mouth before answering, which meant she had to 
give it thought.

&quot;Many people have felt that way in the past. Some glean joy from the 
act, and turn into very selfless people, and eventually, they too are 
cleansed. Others do become more miserable, and end up with a tragic 
ending to their life. Yet I can&#39;t tell you what you&#39;re supposed to be 
doing in life; that&#39;s ultimately your decision. I know you feel you have 
no choice, but really you do. And there is always more than one path.&quot;

Keeping&#39;s words had given her little solace. Corona snubbed the pretty 
teacher, mostly because it seemed she had never had a bad day or a solid 
doubt in her life, much less agonizing nightmares and endless self-pity. 
She left the session hopeless, as always; at least Keys didn&#39;t try and 
sound superior or more well-off. She knew what misery was; Corona could 
see it in her lovely, aged face. She had been widowed without child, but 
managed to continue going, if only to teach and enrich others&#39; lives.

There was one girl in particular that Corona was drawn to, but it was 
the darkest, bleakest, most turbulent soul she had ever encountered in 
her life. Most people had minor-to-major problems in their life, and 
while in Marcos&#39; company, their mood lightened and their burden became 
easier, while Corona felt worse. They were shadows, but this girl was as 
black as a bottomless hole, twisted and warped with years of anger, 
abuse, neglect, despair, and loneliness. If a mere shadow could cause 
Corona to have wretched dreams, what would the great darkness bear her? 
If somebody like Lilian, Olivia, or Rai set her into fits, what would a 
person like Furious Hail do?

The very first time Corona got the nerve to speak to Hail, she didn&#39;t 
dream a nightmare, she met one.

But something very strange happened during that first encounter. 
Usually, people walked away from Corona in a healed state of mind, as if 
her namesake had been true to its word, while Corona herself suffered. 
But when she spoke to Hail, to Alexandra Blair, Corona didn&#39;t find 
herself wretched or miserable or despondent, as she usually did, and 
Hail certainly didn&#39;t walk away refreshed. On the contrary; Marcos&#39; own 
burden seemed lighter, while Hail grew worse and worse. Something like 
that had never happened before, so naturally, she was intrigued.

Marcos spoke to Hail again, and got a kinder reception&#151;perhaps it took 
her longer to recover since her darkness was so intense? Furious Hail 
was not her bullish self then: she didn&#39;t snap or bite or curse, she 
just spoke grudgingly and snarled, then laughed grimly and muttered to 
herself. A week later, she actually looked pleasant, though Corona was 
unaware that Hail had found her first lover, the rambunctious and saucy 
Ivory Tran, whom Corona knew through reputation (and Farrah Kwong). She 
and Corona didn&#39;t speak to each other very often, but when they did, it 
was amiable, as if it had been Ivory that had lifted the burden.

But hope was a serrated knife, stabbing into her chest. Every time she 
attempted it, it only ended up cutting her more, sawing through bones 
and tender organs, until at last it would eventually leave her 
butchered, broken, and depraved. Furious Hail did not stay with Ivory 
long; as a matter of fact, Ivory soon broke up with her in order to 
pursue somebody else, and unfortunately, Hail had a pretty good idea who 
that somebody was.

For many nights, Corona had unsettling fits of sleep, but no nightmares. 
Speaking with Hail had lessened their impact, or sometimes driven them 
away completely, but now that Ivory had left her, the fury of her 
namesake came out in full, unbearable force. Corona had went one whole 
night not sleeping at all, so terrible were her thoughts and feelings.

&quot;She&#39;s grieving,&quot; she groaned to herself in the darkness. &quot;I can feel 
her grieving! A misery like this would drive anyone to madness and 
death; how on earth can she tolerate it?&quot; Corona realized that Hail had 
been tolerating it all her life, that this was just a new level of pain, 
that if she did recover, she would be even more hollow and bleak than 
before. Corona hated getting attached to people, and she shunned 
relationships and people in general, but something inside told her that, 
more than anything, more than ever, she was needed. Furious Hail, 
Alexandra Blair needed the vacuum of Corona&#39;s presence to wipe away all 
that harshness, but with a vortex that deep, what would happen next? 
Would Corona break under the strain and die? Would she lose her mind? Or 
would she simply fail, having nobody to wallow with in the agony?

Nobody except, perhaps, the only other person who could ever understand 
her, the only other one so encompassed by the horror.

She came to realize she loved Furious Hail very much.

As this clarity settled onto her, she found a strange peace of mind, 
like some calm eye of a great storm. She had passed through the first 
part, bitter and torn apart, but she had survived. She felt calm, in 
control, unafraid for the first time since... ever, maybe, and she knew 
what she had to do. There were no doubts. There was no question. There 
was no reasoning against it: Corona Marcos had to pull Furious Hail out 
of that darkness, even if it took her own life.

Then again, perhaps it was the only way she could be cleansed. Saving 
someone so deep in turmoil just might save her as well. It was worth a 
shot, and what did she honestly have to lose? Even her life didn&#39;t seem 
like her own.

That gray September morning, Corona woke up with her alarm. No nightmare 
had plagued her. She was too clear for that.

She rested her head against the window of the bus. Her breath started to 
become visible in the late summer air.

She walked to her first class with conviction. Art was just a few hours 
away.</pre>
