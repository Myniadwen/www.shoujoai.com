<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 20 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>      Krystal was glad she had driven with Isaka instead of using the demon&#39;s shadow 
abilities. Okay, maybe she was playing mediator by leaving the two of them alone, but how 
was anything going to change if they didn&#39;t talk about it? The blonde let those thoughts 
leave her head as soon as she arrived at her destination.

      It had taken a little while to get to the forest where the shrine was, but luckily, it 
was located between her home and Abby&#39;s house. Krystal parked and got out. The air was still 
nice and warm so she hurried down the path. After a few minutes, she came upon the silent 
shrine, the sisters probably asleep.

      She&#39;d just sneak in, grab her sword and leave a note. She was going to come by 
tomorrow anyway. As Krystal went inside and headed towards her guest bedroom, she heard the 
murmur of voices. Were they still awake?

      If someone was still up, then it was probably better for her to tell them that she was 
just stopping by. Krystal stepped closer to the Hoshi&#39;s bedroom. The door was slightly ajar 
and she froze in front of it, peeking in. The young woman felt a strange chill down her back 
as her limited vision allowed her the view of...

      Hoshi was leaning over Tsuki and her hand was... her hand was at the brunette&#39;s chest. 
Krystal&#39;s eyes widened. They weren&#39;t... she wasn&#39;t - they weren&#39;t really doing that were 
they? As Hoshi pulled away, Tsuki curled up on the floor, her sleeping robes completely 
disheveled.

      &quot;There, you should be all better now,&quot; Hoshi murmured, in a way that made Krystal more 
anxious. &quot;Now, Hina, don&#39;t be scared,&quot; the silver haired woman said, presumably looking to 
her younger sister. Krystal couldn&#39;t see Hina.

      Hoshi walked out of the blonde&#39;s view, but she could still see part of Tsuki&#39;s body, 
lying on the floor, dejected. There was the rustling of clothes in the room and then a sharp 
cry from Hina. Krystal backed away from the door as the girl&#39;s cry was quickly muffled by... 
by something and Krystal no longer wanted to think about.

      Then there was a sound of a giggle, then another and when it continued, Krystal was 
already down the hallway, just wanting to find her sword and leave.

      For some reason, she was sickened on the inside at their... just at what she just saw 
- there was something so wrong about it. It wasn&#39;t like how she and Isaka made love or 
touched each other. What Hoshi was doing... doing to her &quot;sisters&quot; and the way they were 
reacting was just...

      Krystal wondered if she even wanted to get her sword. 

***** 

      Isaka was proud of herself. She and Tsuru managed to have a perfectly civil 
conversation, reminiscing on mutual friends and times with Tycara. That was good... but 
then... well, Isaka found out about Tsuru&#39;s little opportunity.

      &quot;Ah, Tsuru, I&#39;ve been looking for you!&quot; Erin had walked into the kitchen, happy to 
find the blue haired girl. Tsuru flushed a bright red. &quot;Me and Faye were wondering if 
you...&quot; The goddess trailed off and looked over at the demon.

      &quot;We were just wondering if you were still up to that offer,&quot; Erin finished. Tsuru 
really couldn&#39;t believe this was happening. She hoped that Erin, being obviously the more 
demure of the two goddesses, would talk her lover out of a three way. No such luck for 
Tsuru...

      Isaka perked up at Erin&#39;s words. &quot;Offer...? What offer?&quot; Tsuru flushed and the demon 
laughed. &quot;Oh, are Faye and Erin going to give you an &#39;informative&#39; talk about sex, like they 
did with Eveon?&quot;

      Tsuru however, just covered her face with her hands and Isaka frowned. &quot;What? That 
isn&#39;t it? What are you talking about, Erin?&quot;

      The goddess just gave her an awkward smile. Isaka was still confused and decided to 
drink some water. Unfortunately, Faye chose that moment to walk and saw, &quot;Tsuru! Are you 
ready for some sexual healing?&quot;

      The demon spurted out all her water at Tsuru, much to the blue haired girl&#39;s relief. 
Maybe the cold water would help her face cool down... &quot;Sexual healing... as in...?&quot; Isaka 
looked between the three other females before shouting, &quot;Tsuru, you have to do it!&quot;

      &quot;What? What are you talking about?! They&#39;re in a loving relationship and want me to... 
it&#39;s just not right!&quot; Tsuru shouted back, standing up from her chair.

      &quot;But they want to help you and by God, you are going to have a threesome with them!&quot; 
Isaka said, also standing up. &quot;I owe you for all the things I&#39;ve done and like hell I&#39;m 
going to let you back away from this opportunity!&quot;

      At that moment, Sakura quietly entered the kitchen, causing the two feuding woman to 
stop. The angel murmured, &quot;Faye? I had... a question.&quot; She rustled her wings and Tsuru 
couldn&#39;t help but stare. She was still in awe at the pretty lesbian angel who also happened 
to be the mother of a girl she once liked.

      Faye nodded. &quot;Sure, what did you want to ask me about?&quot;

      &quot;Earlier... earlier you were talking to Eveon about foreplay and I&#39;m always afraid I 
don&#39;t do that enough with Abby and-&quot; The angel was speaking uncharacteristically fast and 
the love goddess soon guided her to a corner.

      &quot;Alright, let&#39;s talk over here... the first thing you want is to set the mood and be 
sure to...&quot; Faye&#39;s words tapered off. Tsuru couldn&#39;t believe that Sakura was periodically 
screwing Abby. The thought of it was just...

      Goodness, that little daydream made her feel like a pervert. Isaka caught her look and 
grabbed her by the shoulders across the counter. &quot;See! Faye is an expert on sex because 
she&#39;s the flipping Goddess of Love! And Erin - Erin, well she and Faye probably have nothing 
better to do but screw themselves senseless because they&#39;re totally in love!&quot;

      Erin nodded with a faint, &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; as Isaka started to shake Tsuru. &quot;Erin&#39;s also 
the Goddess of Serpents! You know what that means, right?&quot; Tsuru shook her head. &quot;Just think 
- what do snakes have that&#39;s special?&quot;

      Tsuru gave her a confused look. &quot;P... poisonous fangs...?&quot;

      Isaka let go of her. &quot;No you idiot - if that was true, then Faye would have pretty 
nasty love bites everywhere. I was talking about the fact that snakes have really long 
tongues and if Erin-&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m right here,&quot; Erin screeched, able to hear their entire conversation.

      &quot;...and that should have her trembling. Just be sure not to stall bringing her 
pleasure. The point is to build her up, not tease her,&quot; Faye said expertly as she lead 
Sakura to the stairs.

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; the angel said. &quot;I will be sure to try it tonight with Abby.&quot; She went 
quickly up the stairs, probably eager to spring a surprise on Abby.

      &quot;Faye...&quot; Erin murmured. &quot;If you keep this up, everyone will know about our sex 
life...&quot;

      The other goddess shrugged. &quot;Well, we learn things by experience, right? But I guess 
you&#39;re right - I&#39;m starting to rub off on everyone just a bit...&quot; The red head adjusted her 
baseball cap and then leveled her gaze at Tsuru. &quot;Ready?&quot;

      She was going to bolt, but Erin clamped her hands down on Tsuru&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Now, 
don&#39;t try to go anywhere. We want to help you. All your experiences in bed haven&#39;t been 
great, so we&#39;re going to assist you in getting comfortable in your body,&quot; the green haired 
girl explained.

      Isaka snorted. &quot;I&#39;m not horrible in bed, okay? But Tsuru - do you really want your 
last experience to be with me, or do you want a nice, relaxing, sensual night with them?&quot;

      Tsuru shook her head. &quot;But, it&#39;s weird! I don&#39;t want to kill their relationship and- 
and-&quot;

      Faye laughed. &quot;Oh no. Like Erin said, we&#39;re doing this to help you, not because we 
want to screw you.&quot;

      Isaka thought the second part was questionable, but she said, &quot;Exactly. Whether you 
like it or not, you&#39;re doing this.&quot;

      Tsuru yelled as she was dragged away, &quot;If you were a real friend, you&#39;d save me!&quot;

      Isaka just waved at her. &quot;You&#39;ll thank me later.&quot; 

***** 

      Sakura had been pleasing Abby when she heard strange sounds out in the hall. The angel 
stopped kissing the blonde&#39;s inner thigh and looked up. It sounded like an argument... 
maybe? Or perhaps someone was being dragged down the hall. She could hear voices, so it must 
be-

      &quot;Sakura...&quot; came a groan from the woman beneath her. She turned to look at Abby, who 
was lying there in a haze, her hair spread out. Sakura figured that what Faye taught her was 
working very well. She leaned down to give Abby a quick kiss and started a trail back down.

      &quot;Please,&quot; Abby whined out. &quot;Don&#39;t tease me...!&quot;

      Sakura readily complied with her lover. 

***** 

      Faye, Erin and Tsuru froze upon hearing a piercing scream from the room they just 
passed. Faye let a sheepish smile creep on her face from the look Erin was giving her. 
&quot;Dang... I guess Eveon wasn&#39;t kidding when she said her mom was loud.&quot;

      Tsuru blushed and stared at the door. Sakura had just... she and Abby... Sakura 
learned that from Faye, so... so...! &quot;Alright, let&#39;s get going,&quot; Erin said cheerfully, 
pulling the stunned woman along.

      Faye sighed as Tsuru still spurted out excuses. &quot;I-I need to use the restroom and... 
and... I need to take a shower and I don&#39;t have a change of clothes and-&quot;

      &quot;Fine,&quot; Faye said with a small smile. &quot;You can take a shower once we get to the room. 
Don&#39;t worry so much - we already said that this was going to be a relaxing experience.&quot;

      As soon as they entered the room, Tsuru was directed to the shower, leaving Erin and 
Faye in the bedroom. She sat on the edge of the tub, letting out a long sigh. How was she 
going to get out of this...? She figured she should at least try to take a shower before the 
goddesses knocked on the door to see if she was alright.

      Tsuru let a small smile creep on her face as she washed herself. At least they were 
helping her forget all about the incident with Krystal. And at least Isaka was attempting to 
be apologetic. But would it ever be enough? She&#39;d lost so many things and she was continuing 
to lose to the demon... could she ever move on?

      Tsuru dried herself off and decided that she could at least try to get over it. Hell, 
maybe her and Isaka would meet halfway. Or maybe Tsuru would be three fourths of the way 
their, since Isaka could probably only manage a fourth. Whatever.

      It was then that she realized how stupid it was to take a shower. As she dried her 
hair with a towel, Tsuru became aware of her lack of clothes. She only had one pair and they 
were currently on the floor of the bathroom. She wasn&#39;t going to put them back on, but... 
then she&#39;d have to walk out in the room naked, just covered by a towel. Crap.

      Tsuru gathered up her dirty clothes in her hands and cautiously opened the door. 
&quot;Uh... Do you guys have extra clothes?&quot;

      Erin got off of the bed and grabbed Tsuru&#39;s dirty clothes. &quot;Nope - what would be the 
point of that?&quot; the snake goddess said, depositing the clothes in a laundry hamper. Tsuru 
froze on the spot, resisting the urge to stare at the other woman and failing miserably.

      Erin had diverged herself of all clothing except for some rather frilly, suggestive 
lingerie. No wonder Faye had been trying to get her clothes off earlier... Tsuru snapped 
away from the sight to see Faye sitting on the bed, laughing.

      &quot;I know, isn&#39;t she beautiful?&quot; Faye asked, playing with a strand of red hair. Tsuru 
gulped. Even Faye was just as attractive, now with her hair down and only wearing her 
undergarments. The blue haired girl wasn&#39;t sure what she should do... escape looked 
impossible, but getting caught-

      &quot;Please don&#39;t be so tense,&quot; Erin murmured into her ear, wrapping her arms around 
Tsuru&#39;s waist. Even if the towel was preventing her from feeling Erin&#39;s body, it was still 
all too nice and warm. Faye stepped off of the bed and grabbed Tsuru&#39;s hands.

      &quot;She&#39;s right. We want you to relax and be comfortable with yourself.&quot; Faye started to 
guide Tsuru to the bed as Erin guided her from behind.

      &quot;A-are you sure? I mean, both of you would probably rather not have a third wheel 
involved in your sexual relations and this is just awkward and... and...&quot; Tsuru&#39;s words 
tapered off as she realized she couldn&#39;t talk her way out of this.

      She wasn&#39;t sure if she was supposed to be happy or upset. But when Erin undid her 
towel, Tsuru was quite sure she was happy.
