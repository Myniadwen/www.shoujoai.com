<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 9 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>      Isaka could have ripped Seth apart when she entered Krystal&#39;s room. The couple was 
entangled, but thankfully, it was rather chaste. The demon had already pledged to be 
Krystal&#39;s one and only. No way would some male idiot get in her way! Krystal started to stir 
and Isaka put on her best apologetic face.

      As the exorcist awoke and saw a teary eyed demon next to the bed, she almost jolted 
from surprise. &quot;Kry-Krystal! I&#39;m sorry... I shouldn&#39;t haf bitten his hand... I&#39;m sorry, 
please don&#39;t be mad at me!&quot; With that, Isaka jumped into Krystal&#39;s arms, crying.

      This awoke Seth seeing as Krystal was frantically trying to assure the demon that it 
was alright that she had mutilated her boyfriend&#39;s hand. As the couple set about forgiving 
and trying to calm down Isaka, they didn&#39;t know that she was really crying crocodile tears.  

***** 

      Abby let out a sigh as she rearranged the table and the chairs. Eveon had thrown a 
total fit (and most of the furniture) because of her joke. Jeez, in a few years her daughter 
would be graduating from high school. Abby just rubbed her temples. &quot;God, my daughter is 
getting more action than me...&quot;

      Her train of thought was knocked off track as she heard a commotion outside. Probably 
another hung over citizen or maybe a few badgers asleep in the trash can. When Abby opened 
the door, she was greeted by frantic people of the town. &quot;

      &quot;Abby!&quot; one man said, &quot;Where&#39;s the exorcist? Some demon has come here, attacking the 
place.&quot;

      It didn&#39;t take long for the woman to go get Krystal and tell her to prepare for an 
attack. 

***** 

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry about all the stuff my mommy said,&quot; Eveon murmured to Mina.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright. She&#39;s just... having fun, I guess.&quot; The two of them decided to take a 
nice walk in the woods and reach the field on the other side. Granted, it was kind of close 
to Isaka&#39;s hidden mansion, but they didn&#39;t mind. They were lying down in the grass, staring 
up at the clouds as they passed by. It was then that Eveon felt Mina&#39;s hand ghost across her 
own. She blushed and turned to see her girlfriend staring right at her.

      &quot;It&#39;s funny,&quot; said Mina. &quot;...even though we do the same things we did as friends, 
everything feels so much better.&quot; She sat up and leaned over Eveon. The blonde girl pushed 
herself up on her elbows. Mina pushed her lips up against Eveon&#39;s, but their precious kiss 
was predictably interrupted.

      &quot;My, my... isn&#39;t that touching.&quot; The unfamiliar, childish female voice rocked both of 
them out of the moment. They sat up and saw a young woman standing there, looking quite out 
place. Eveon instinctively stood up with Mina behind her. The woman who was watching them 
with mischievous silver eyes had matching hair and was wearing a white dress. She was only 
about 18 or so and she was giving Eveon a really bad feeling.

      &quot;Seeing the way you two are... I assume that you must know Isaka. Can you tell me 
where she is?&quot; Eveon exchanged a quick glance with Mina before speaking. &quot;I... don&#39;t know 
who you&#39;re talking about. I&#39;d really appreciate it if you&#39;d leave us be.&quot;

      The woman just giggled menacingly, even though her voice was sweet and lilting. 
&quot;You&#39;re sorely mistaken,&quot; The woman&#39;s hand began to crackle with a strange energy. &quot;You must 
know Isaka. I&#39;ve been dying to get even with her... I wonder if I should start with her 
little lesbian friends.&quot;

      As the energy came flying at them, Eveon quickly pulled Mina out of the way. The woman 
looked rather surprised. &quot;Hmm... that&#39;s a lot better than I expected. Of course, you can&#39;t 
expect to beat me-&quot;

      Her taunting was cut off as she avoided a strike from Krystal&#39;s blade. The young woman 
had literally just jumped into the fight, dressed in her full exorcist outfit. &quot;I&#39;ll take 
care of this, you two should go with Abby.&quot;

      Mina nodded and said, &quot;Alright, be careful!&quot; She let herself be dragged from the field 
by Eveon as they ran to where Abby was standing near the edge of the forest with Seth and 
Isaka. As soon as they got there, Eveon said, &quot;She&#39;s after Isaka. Did you piss her off?&quot;

      Seth looked down expectantly at the demon, whose eyes widened as she recognized the 
woman fighting Krystal. &quot;Oh no! You haf to be kidding... why is she here now of all times?!&quot;

      Krystal barely dodged the last attack thrown at her. Who was this woman? &quot;Demon, tell 
me your name!&quot; The woman just pouted. &quot;Demon? I find that insulting. You&#39;re an exorcist, 
right? If you know what&#39;s good for you, you&#39;ll tell me what happened to Isaka.&quot;

      Like Krystal was going to tell her where Isaka was... &quot;My name is Tycara Shishamaru 
and I am no simple demon!&quot; Krystal swung her sword at the next volley of energy thrown at 
her, but it did nothing. She felt the shock of the hit before falling to her knees.

      &quot;You mistake me for a demon, correct? That&#39;s why none of your attacks are working.&quot; 
Tycara allowed the energy to gather once again in her palm. &quot;You see, I have control over 
light and dark energy, so you can&#39;t hurt me, but I can hurt you.&quot;

      Krystal decided that this was not good. A gunshot rung out and Tycara caught a bullet 
in her hand. She looked at it quizzically, then at the pistol in Seth&#39;s hands. The young man 
didn&#39;t expect the shot to affect Tycara, but he didn&#39;t think she would actually catch the 
bullet! Of course, his real purpose was to distract the woman not hurt her.

      &quot;...and what do you think your doing?&quot; Tycara asked, flicking away the useless piece 
of metal. He tried to think of some manly response, but hell, his girlfriend was the one 
with the holy power and experience. &quot;...don&#39;t worry about the exorcist. Let me be your 
opponent.&quot;

      Tycara gave a slight pout, but she suddenly disappeared from his sight. Seth felt his 
heart stop as he heard her from behind. &quot;You&#39;re kind of cute, but not much of challenge.&quot; He 
ducked just in time to avoid the punch directed at his head. Tycara was just playing with 
him, but that was okay... Isaka would so owe him for this.

      Speaking of the little demon, she raced over to Krystal&#39;s side as Seth distracted 
Tycara. &quot;Krystal! You can&#39;t beat her, not like this!&quot; The exorcist turned to the demon as 
she continued on, &quot;Tycara is half-angel, half-demon, don&#39;t ask, long story. I defeated her a 
long time ago, but she must be back for me... It didn&#39;t think she&#39;d come back at this 
moment.&quot;

      Krystal nodded and stood up. &quot;Alright, that means I can&#39;t rely on my power, huh?&quot; 
Isaka shook her head furiously. &quot;You can&#39;t beat her! I&#39;m the only one who can, with your 
help, we can do it!&quot; Krystal was starting to see where this was going. &quot;I... need you to 
release the soul prison on me.&quot;

      The exorcist bit her lip nervously, but she watched as Tycara knocked Seth to the 
ground. &quot;I trust you, Isaka.&quot; Krystal placed her hand on Isaka&#39;s head and started to whisper 
quietly to herself to release the spell. That was when Tycara looked up and saw Isaka.

      &quot;There you are! What happened to you?&quot; She giggled at Isaka&#39;s form before sending a 
maelstrom of energy at the two of them. &quot;No!&quot; Seth shouted as he scrambled to his feet. 
Krystal turned to see it coming at them, surprise clearly evident on her face.

      Tycara just laughed to herself until it dispersed. Isaka rose to stand at her full 
height, her body and powers restored. She smirked at Krystal. &quot;I&#39;ll protect you now.&quot; The 
blonde woman sprawled on the ground, her clothes and disguise decimated, but everything was 
fine. &quot;...Isaka?&quot;

      The demon conjured up her own power and Tycara just grinned. &quot;I&#39;m a lot stronger this 
time, so you aren&#39;t going to beat me!&quot; Isaka&#39;s attack was easily nullified by Tycara who 
aimed a kick at the demon. She dodged and went for a punch. Seth raced over to Krystal and 
tried to help her up. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      His girlfriend nodded and watched the fight. Isaka wasn&#39;t fairing too well... sure, 
she was able to keep up with Tycara, but her breathing rate had increased and she was tiring 
a lot faster. Krystal gripped the hilt of her sword before standing up. &quot;Just stay here, 
Seth. I think me and Isaka can beat her together.&quot;

      With that, she hurried over to Isaka&#39;s side, swinging her sword at Tycara. The woman 
only dodged and backed up, not liking her odds now. &quot;...Krystal. If we hit her at the same 
time, it should work out fine.&quot; The blonde woman nodded at the demon&#39;s suggestion.

      Tycara grounded her teeth in frustration as she watched the two of them gather up 
energy. She barely had enough time to summon up a barrier against it as Isaka let out a 
maelstrom of dark energy and Krystal let out a stream of holy energy from her sword.

      The huge blast that occurred blinded Abby as she held her hands over the eyes of both 
Eveon and Mina. When it dispersed, she could only see spots, while the two young girls could 
only see the smoke. By the time it cleared, they were surprised to see that Seth, Krystal, 
Isaka and Tycara were no where to be found. In fact, the field was unscathed so they 
couldn&#39;t have been decimated...

      &quot;Where... did they go?&quot; Mina asked and gave Eveon a concerned look. &quot;How... about we 
worry about that once I stop seeing spots,&quot; suggested Abby as she tried not to trip over her 
own two feet. 

***** 

      Seth began to come up a speech in his head. &#39;Krystal... you know, maybe we should 
consider taking this exorcist thing a little more seriously. I mean, we just go blasted to 
oblivion and all, not to mention-&#39; His train of thought was knocked off course as he stirred 
out of his dream-like state.

      &quot;Oh goodness! You&#39;re awake.&quot; The sweet, childish voice was kind of familiar. Seth 
opened his eyes and nearly screamed as he saw Tycara right next to him.

      Instead of voicing his concern of being so close to such a dangerous person, he 
accidentally fell off the bed, creaking his fall with his previously mangled hand. This time 
he did scream. Tycara pulled him back on to the bed, her face distraught. She had been 
sitting next to the bed on a chair before Seth had fallen gracefully out of bed.

      &quot;Are you alright?! I&#39;m so sorry I scared you. I didn&#39;t mean to, honest!!!&quot; Seth 
started to inch away from her, wondering why Tycara was so worried about him. He gave her a 
concerned look, &quot;Did you get a major concussion in that blast?&quot;

      She just gave him a cute, albeit embarrassed, smile. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. Let me 
rebandage your hand...&quot; Tycara took out a nearby first aid kit and started treating his 
reinjured hand. Seth took this time to look around. It appeared they were in a rather nice, 
spacious room. As the gears started to click and whir in his head, it became rather apparent 
that something was wrong. Very wrong.

      &quot;...where are Krystal and Isaka?&quot; Tycara just gave him a strange look. &quot;Umm... I don&#39;t 
know...&quot; He would have believed her if it weren&#39;t for the fact that &#39;liar&#39; was branded all 
over her face. &quot;Tycara... I know that you&#39;re an evil demon-angel thing, but where is my 
girlfriend?!&quot;

      She held up her hands in defense. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! It was all a trick, but Isaka guilt 
tripped me into doing it!&quot; Seth just gave her a confused look. &quot;Wait. Isaka said you... were 
her greatest enemy so how could she...?&quot;

      Tycara just smiled guiltily. &quot;Actually... she&#39;s like my big sister and she needed a 
favor... and so, umm... 
we-set-up-this-elaborate-plan-to-get-her-out-of-the-soul-prison-please-don&#39;t-be-mad!&quot; Even 
though she spoke quite fast, Seth understood it.

      That meant... 

***** 

      Krystal wasn&#39;t quite sure what happened after her and Isaka joined forces to defeat 
Tycara, but she did know that the surface she was lying on was quite comfortable. As she 
awoke, she realized it was an extremely comfortable bed. The bedspread she was lying on had 
to be filled with feathers or some wonderful cotton substance.

      She pushed herself up on her elbows and surveyed the foreign room. There were candles 
lit nearby, but the room seemed elegantly fashioned. It was quite roomy with antique like 
furniture... it was more or less something she would expect to find in a mansion-

      It suddenly clicked as to where she was.

      &quot;...hmm... so you&#39;re finally awake.&quot; The husky whisper against her ear startled 
Krystal. She almost jumped from the bed, but a firm arm was already wrapped around her 
waist. &quot;I thought you would never wake up.&quot;

      Krystal craned her neck and gulped as she recognized Isaka&#39;s mischievous lavender 
eyes. Unfortunately, she left her neck open for a kiss from the demon. After letting out a 
sharp gasp, she heard Isaka speak again.

      &quot;No matter how much I want you...&quot; Isaka pushed her down on the bed and lied down next 
to her. &quot;...you&#39;re the kind of girl who will only do things with the one that you love.&quot; 
Krystal was bright red from the situation, but she let out a mental sigh of relief as she 
nodded furiously.

      &quot;In that case, we&#39;ll just take it slowly-&quot; Isaka&#39;s hand reached into Krystal&#39;s 
tattered shirt and splayed across her exposed stomach, &quot;-because there will be plenty of 
time for &#39;that&#39; later.&quot;

      Krystal started to sputter, well aware that her soul prison wasn&#39;t going to save her 
now. &quot;I-I-I don&#39;t like you like that, Isaka!&quot; The demon just leaned in closer.

      &quot;Oh, that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to have a little... sharing time.&quot; Isaka whispered into 
her ear, &quot;What&#39;s your favorite color?&quot;

      &quot;L-l-light b-b-blue...&quot; Krystal response was awarded with Isaka&#39;s tongue darting out 
at her neck. &quot;Really? ...Purple is my favorite color.&quot;

      The blonde haired woman knew that this &quot;share time&quot; of theirs wasn&#39;t going to be so 
innocent. And that was confirmed when Isaka &quot;accidentally&quot; skimmed her hand over her breast.
