<a href="../original/artemis-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The intense looking blonde stretched out gracefully in
the middle of the floor, the light streaming in
through the open window, a gentle breeze stirring her
hair. Athena smiled wryly as she walked back towards
the bed, her oversized shirt making a simple nightie,
otherwise still mostly undressed. What was visible of
her body was marked by war, old scars and burns
scattered across her arms and crisscrossing those long
legs.

Moving with a kind of wary energy the lady dug out
clothes from the closet nearby, tossing a clean shirt
and pants on quickly and easily. Athena tied her hair
back with an elastic band, peering in the mirror a
moment then decided to skip wearing any makeup.
Slipping socks and shoes on she was off, only pausing
to lock the door with a casual wave of her hand.

The old apartment building was just behind the
Daughters, owned lock stock and barrel by Circe and
Diana as well as under the same soft of protections
the bar had. While a little run down looking on the
outside the apartments were all quite comfortable,
though Athena had been mildly surprised at some of the
neighbors.

&quot;Good morning Athena,&quot; Jasmine said, the purple haired
lovely smiling up at her impishly. One of the
semi-regulars she kept a room in the building,
frequently sharing it with her lovers like the police
officer Alex Conner.

&quot;Morning Jazz,&quot; Athena said with easy familiarity as
they fell into step together going down the hall to
the elevator.

&quot;You&#39;re still all alone?&quot; Jazz teased, &quot;I could always
stop by and keep you company.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d think Alex is keeping you busy enough,&quot; Athena
said dryly, &quot;and besides, I&#39;m too old for you,&quot; She
still wasn&#39;t quite sure how to take the other woman&#39;s
teasing offers, and after much thought had decided
just to politely ignore them.

Jazz chuckled as they stepped into the older lift and
headed for the lower floor. &quot;You can&#39;t be much older
than I am,&quot; she protested.

The former goddess of war tried to hide her amusement.
&quot;Trust me, I have a few years on you,&quot; Athena said as
they came to a stop with a bump, the door sliding
open.

Jazz lead the way outside, tossing a grin to Athena as
she said, &quot;I always liked older lovers.&quot; With that she
was off, bouncing out of the little lobby and out onto
the street.

Shaking her head with a smile Athena walked over the
lawn towards the Daughters itself, using the key that
Artemis had given her to unlock the door. &#39;I have to
remember to call her Diana,&#39; she reminded herself once
again.

&quot;Urrgh,&quot; the soft groan drew Athena&#39;s eyes up to where
Circe was laying on the bar, her long blonde hair
fanning out around her.

&quot;How did...?&quot; Athena blinked, walking up to the
polished surface and gently but firmly shaking the
woman&#39;s arm.

Circe opened one oddly orange eye and groaned again.
&quot;God I have a headache,&quot; she managed, pushing herself
up so that she could clutch at her head.

&quot;Hung over?&quot; Athena asked sympathetically.

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Circe winced. She carefully slip off the bar
and onto the floor, her leather skirt and white top
splattered by beer and other stains.

&quot;And where is Diana?&quot; Athena asked as she reached out
to help steady Circe a bit.

&quot;Here,&quot; the voice came from behind the bar, then
Diana&#39;s hand appeared as she pulled herself up,
smiling a bit sheepishly under her sister&#39;s glare. Her
long brown hair fell messily out of it&#39;s usual
ponytail and she looked terrible, bloodshot eyes and
all.

&quot;Did I miss a party last night?&quot; Athena had to ask
them.

&quot;It&#39;s not what you think,&quot; Circe winced as she
clutched the side of her head, &quot;we had a full Circle
last night, to upgrade our defenses.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t feel....&quot; Athena blinked.

&quot;You have to admit you&#39;re not the most mystically
sensitive of the family,&quot; Diana reminded her gently.
She rubbed at her eyes as she said, &quot;We proofed the
place against most kinds of semi-divine attack, we
think.&quot;

&quot;Think being the operative word,&quot; Circe sounded a bit
sheepish. &quot;Nobody has tried this kind of defense
before, we think,&quot; she revealed.

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Athena was curious as she led the
two women over to a table, sat them down then went for
some coffee.

&quot;We cross-connected our protective shields and wards
to several other-wheres,&quot; Diana related once Athena
returned with the two steaming mugs, &quot;like Hel,
Asgard, Olympus itself, the Dreamtime and a few
others.&quot;

&quot;So any magical or divine attack will simply be bled
off into those other realms,&quot; Athena nodded, &quot;but
won&#39;t the gods in those realms object?&quot;

&quot;We have Lady Hel&#39;s permission,&quot; Circe smirked, &quot;and
Asgard got conquered by the Frost Giants back in the
fourties. The others are either unruled or....&quot;

&quot;And I don&#39;t really care if this bounces back on the
remaining Olympians,&quot; Diana admitted with a dangerous
little smile.

Athena shook her head, even though the purely rational
side of her personality admitted she was probably
right. She looked at the two of them thoughtfully
before changing the subject, &quot;Do you two want some
breakfast?&quot; Both women nodded vigorously and Athena
fought back a smile. A few moments later she emerged
from the bar&#39;s little kitchen with eggs, bacon ad
porridge, all balanced on a large tray.

&quot;You know, with cooking this good I&#39;d marry you if I
weren&#39;t taken,&quot; Circe said happily.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you having any?&quot; Diana asked her sister even
as she dug in.

Athena munched on a piece of toast even as she blushed
slightly from Circe&#39;s comment. &quot;I don&#39;t usually get
hungry until I&#39;ve had my morning run,&quot; she answered
her sister.

&quot;Way too healthy for me,&quot; Circe shook her head with a
smile. &quot;How far do you go?&quot;

&quot;Several miles,&quot; Athena admitted, &quot;closer to ten if I
want a real workout.&quot;

&quot;If you head west that&#39;d put you out by Sisterhood
books by the time you&#39;re done,&quot; Diana mused, knowing
the city&#39;s layout pretty well.

&quot;True,&quot; Athena smiled slightly, &quot;I stop in for a
coffee occasionally.&quot;

Circe smirked as she scooped some of her eggs, a bit
of salsa dribbled over them. &quot;Has Hunter hit on you
yet?&quot; she asked.

Athena&#39;s cheeks colored faintly. &quot;Well, yes,&quot; she
conceded, &quot;but I turned her down.&quot;

Diana was calmly eating her food as she said, &quot;You
should take her up on the offer, I&#39;m told she&#39;s very
educational.&quot;

Athena early choked on her toast, &quot;Sister!&quot;

Diana looked over at her lover with a wry smile, &quot;As
you may have noticed, my sister is remarkably
traditional in some ways.&quot;

&quot;Straight?&quot; Circe asked.

&quot;Bisexual,&quot; Athena said firmly, &quot;not that it&#39;s any
business of yours.&quot;

Diana looked interested, &quot;So who was the lucky lady,
if I may ask?&quot;

Circe looked amused, &quot;Or are you bi in name only?&quot;

Athena had a pained look on her face as both women
looked at her eagerly. &quot;You two are terrible,&quot; she
sighed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Diana smirked, &quot;so?&quot;

&quot;Hippolyta,&quot; Athena finally conceded, &quot;the queen of
the amazon tribes.&quot; She smiled wryly as they blinked
at her in surprise and continued, &quot;She called upon me
as her patron goddess and as I got to know her I...
fell in love with her.&quot;

Surprised Circe blurted, &quot;Hippolyta, she was the one
that Heracles raped....&quot; She trailed off in pure
embarrassment.

A muscle in Athena&#39;s jaw jumped as she clenched it in
sudden anger, &quot;Yes.&quot; She smiled grimly, &quot;Another debt
I owe Zeus and his favored son.&quot; With that she pushed
away from the table and strode from the room with
barely an, &quot;Excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Way to go,&quot; Diana sighed, &quot;she was actually cheering
up a bit until you said that.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Circe sighed meekly.</pre>
