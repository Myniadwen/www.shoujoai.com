It was the first time Sally Rosa Redinger saw the man known only as Mr. 
White, and she had to admit, the stories did him no justice. Tall, 
somewhat pale, glowing with an effervescent aura, a smile eternally 
chained to his mouth, eyes gleaming with every color and voice calm, 
melodious, and careful, he didn&#39;t seem real, not even as he walked past 
her politely and assigned himself a spot in the lobby. He could&#39;ve been 
there for many reasons, possibly for Kamaguchi, possibly for Amielle (or 
worse, Pale), possibly for no reason at all. Sally didn&#39;t feel like 
getting involved, so she stepped aside and asked, out of politeness, if 
there was anything she could get him.

&quot;No, thank you. I do not require anything.&quot; His feet seemed to hover as 
he walked. Sally wondered if they really touched the ground, or...

&quot;Holy Hell!&quot; she heard a familiar voice shout. It was Merry; she had 
probably seen her old benefactor and reacted. Sally rushed in and found 
Mr. White standing before Merry, as well as half the population gathered 
there in the building, as if he were a teacher before his students. 
Those few that knew the man better than others seemed appalled that he 
had found them. Marissa drew in a deep breath, and was the first to 
approach him.

&quot;S-sir? What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that question cannot be answered so simply,&quot; he sang, his grin 
becoming wider. &quot;Let us just say for now that...I would like to see dear 
Yohko&#151;and anyone else that would like to meet me. Anyone at all.&quot; The 
hairs on the back of Sally&#39;s neck stood on end. Did he suspect anything? 
Did he know about Amielle, and Alicia, and the girl&#39;s secret identity? 
Sally could only join her girlfriend, keeping wary eyes on the 
foreboding person...if he really was a person. The time passed quickly 
as several of the girls, mostly those from &quot;The Lost&quot;, peppered him with 
questions.

&quot;Sir, do you know anything about Namie and Shalis?&quot; asked Merry 
desperately. He nodded slowly.

&quot;Yes, I do. I know quite a bit about them. They are quite safe and 
sound, I assure you.&quot; A sigh of ultimate relief came from the tall 
woman. So, her actions that one day had not killed any of her friends. 
That was good.

Then, &quot;So where are they? Do they know about this place?&quot;

&quot;They are residing somewhere...peaceful. The compound was unfortunately 
decimated, so they had to be relocated. I...came across them amidst the 
ruins and rubble, and offered to...help them in their way. Many new 
bargains were made thereafter.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean? What bargains?&quot;

&quot;Those contracts are only meant to be observed by the parties in 
question,&quot; he said, which was just his way of saying &quot;mind your own 
business&quot;. Weathers frowned.

&quot;Well, all right, but why don&#39;t you bring them here?&quot;

&quot;All part of the deals.&quot;

&quot;Are they working for you now?&quot;

&quot;In a sense.&quot;

&quot;So I guess you&#39;re pissed off that we abandoned you, huh?&quot;

&quot;Not at all. Considering what has happened, it can be expected.&quot;

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; Marissa interjected, &quot;I heard a few things being 
said from our attackers, something about an...Omega person? Do you know 
what they&#39;re talking about?&quot; If Mr. White did, he didn&#39;t show it.

&quot;Omega? I suppose.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re hiding something.&quot;

&quot;If you want the truth, then I know about him and his operation in 
explicit detail.&quot; A pause. He looked too serious to be doubted. Marissa 
took a breath.

&quot;Where were you on that day anyway? Why did you constantly come and go?&quot;

&quot;I am not one to be tied down,&quot; he stated, sounding even more serious 
than before. &quot;I am not a tame...individual. I came and went as I saw 
fit, to do what I needed to be done.&quot;

&quot;What about Amielle?&quot; asked Lurker. &quot;You search for Amielle, for Pale. 
Why?&quot;

&quot;Pale is lost, just as you all were. I sought her so that I might find 
her.&quot;

&quot;Not how we heard it.&quot; Several people winced. Julie had pretty much let 
the cat out of the bag with that one. The only way she could&#39;ve &quot;heard 
it&quot; was from Stalker herself. Mr. White&#39;s smile became darker.

&quot;Really. How did you hear it?&quot; The Lurker then realized her error and 
shirked away. The man in white laughed once, sharply, and dismissed her. 
&quot;No matter. That is not why I came here.&quot;

&quot;So why?&quot; He tipped his hat.

&quot;To give my respects to the good doctor, of course. She has helped me 
along, and I have done the same for her. Of course, she thinks I have no 
knowledge of what she is truly doing here.&quot;

CONFUSING!

&quot;Alisti right!&quot; barked Lurker. &quot;Make sense, make sense! I head going to 
blow up soon!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Lurker,&quot; sighed Mr. White sadly, &quot;you are far more intelligent than 
you give yourself credit for. But to be blunt, I am here to see Yohko, 
and to inform everyone here of some...developments. If I am not 
mistaken, five people here have already met up with one of my main 
objectives.&quot;

&quot;I believe we asked you to simplify yourself,&quot; snarled Merry, but 
Marissa held her arm, stepped forth, and nodded lowly. Sanaa was not 
there, nor Rin, Kailin, and Setsuka, but if they were, they probably 
would&#39;ve been just as somber.

&quot;You...are talking about Kali, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; he said. &quot;You faced her, and you almost defeated her. That is 
quite an accomplishment, but I suppose I ought not be surprised. You are 
after all what a more foolish person would call an &#145;evolved human&#39;.&quot;

&quot;A what?!&quot; Mr. White smiled sweetly.

&quot;As if you did not know. Both you and your friend, Sanaa, that work of 
beauty, are evolved humans. Did you not come to that conclusion 
yourself?!&quot; Marissa froze, her insides brewing darkly, her mind sent 
hurtling, then crashing, then flailing, through its dark abyss. Everyone 
else was stunned, but she was astonished to a whole new level, deeper 
and darker than she had ever known. The worst thing about it was that 
she knew it to be true, and had known it for a long time.

&quot;I suspected,&quot; she whispered, sounding quite dead. She felt his hand on 
her shoulder, and became flush when his eyes penetrated her living soul.

&quot;You have nothing to be ashamed about. A part of you was brought into 
this world by an offspring of the Parents, but another part, a truer and 
more real part, was given to you by Kurios, Almighty One, and that is 
something that you can hold your head up to.&quot; He smiled, genuinely, and 
squeezed her shoulder. Marissa looked ready to crawl into a closet and 
hide for weeks. She didn&#39;t hear Mr. White continuing, she just...shut 
herself off, until Sanaa came.

What she didn&#39;t hear was, &quot;Kali, the one I am mentioning, was 
responsible for the deaths of Rin Takamatsu, Hsu Kai Lin, Sanaa, Marissa 
Wainright, and countless others, many people who did deserve death and 
many who did not. The only one to have survived an encounter with her, 
save her very creator, is Setsuka Hinomoto, the Lady Snowblood.&quot; What 
she did hear was, &quot;I have come to give you all the information I have on 
her, in the hopes that you will use it to destroy her, once and for all. 
That is one of my missions in this world: I am, with the help of the 
inhabitants of this world, to destroy the biological weapon named Kali, 
the so-called goddess of death!&quot;

......

Most everybody was now crowding around Mr. White as the hour closed. He 
was answering questions, but never spoke of anything terribly major. 
Most of the time he explained about the Seven, or Namie and Shalis, and 
seemed to know just about everything about everybody there. Amielle, 
Alicia, and Yohko were just a few of the people missing from the 
ensemble, but their absence had nothing to do with his presence: Yohko 
was away in a conference (or so Yui Miyamoto said), and Amielle and 
Alicia were most likely in their room (nobody had seen them all day).

Eventually both girls came within viewing distance. Their thirst was 
what drew them there&#151;the gathering was right next to the kitchen. For 
awhile, neither party noticed the other, but then Amielle got a glimpse 
of the crowd, and wondered what new idiocy her allies were up to. She 
brought Alicia&#151;perhaps the gravest mistake she ever made in her life. 
When the two girls came into the room, attention was immediately drawn 
towards them, and Mr. White&#39;s eyes fell on them first. His face 
brightened in a rare flash of joyless shock.

&quot;Amielle!!&quot; he exclaimed. Celestino gawked and felt her entire body turn 
into a glacier: skin, blood, organs, hair, the whole lot. Overwhelming 
guilt and hopelessness followed&#151;and after that came fear, then rage, 
then above all else, the desire to protect the one she loved most. But 
if Mr. White had any animosity towards her, he kept it well-hidden, and 
approached her as a father would come to his daughter.

&quot;Amielle Yeshua Celestino!&quot; he exclaimed, his face bold with new 
thrills. &quot;Not even I thought I would come into contact with you here! 
My-my, it has been awhile, has it not? You are looking superior lately, 
as if something or someone has influenced you for the better. I wonder 
what it could be. Tell me, child, what news of Pale?&quot;

Alicia Moore was right in front of him, breathing quietly.

&quot;...Bastard,&quot; Amielle snorted. The man in white just laughed. &quot;What the 
hell are you doing here? Were you tracking me? What do you want? Come to 
kill me, or press me for answers? Maybe make another bargain? I don&#39;t 
want anything to do with you any more!&quot;

&quot;Well, you certainly have not changed in that aspect. Still rude...but I 
can understand. You did have a hard life. Tell me,&quot; he said, now calmly 
leering at Alicia, &quot;who is this? Oh, please, do not say it is Pale 
herself.&quot; He chuckled. Amielle growled.

&quot;Oh, yes, it&#39;s Pale!&quot; she spat, trying to sound as sarcastic as 
possible. &quot;Here, see, show the nice bastard your wings, O angel of the 
morning! Yes, and while you&#39;re at it, stop some crime and step on this 
man&#39;s kidneys! Yes, here she is, in all her angelic glory! Take her away 
and leave me the hell alone!!&quot; The man in white leered with much less 
pacifism now, giving Amielle a warning gaze.

&quot;You should not be so impetuous in front of me. You could have just said 
no.&quot; With that he walked away; Amielle couldn&#39;t help but smile and wink 
at Alicia once his back was turned. Moore had to fight to suppress the 
giggle in her mouth. Apparently, her secret was that well-hidden from 
him.

When Yohko Kamaguchi first laid eyes on Mr. White, she didn&#39;t look 
surprised at all. In fact, the only thing she did was say a few 
enigmatic words: &quot;I was wondering when you would show up...Nort.&quot;

&quot;So you figured it out, Doctor. How astute...but I ought not expect less 
from you...should I not, Doctor?&quot; His leering eyes eventually corroded 
her calm expression, and she shuddered. Pandora the Gambler had been at 
Yohko&#39;s side, as she always seemed to be, but once she got a look at Mr. 
White, her face exploded in such fear that she ran away and could later 
be heard vomiting in the bathroom. She was promptly ignored; all eyes 
and ears were now focused on the guest, who had been saving his 
explanations for this very moment. Now that he had everyone&#39;s attention, 
he could tell them why he had came.

The history of Kali, the goddess of death, goes back longer than any of 
you could imagine, and further than any of you will believe. Once upon a 
time there was a man named Malchior. He was born in a small tribe in a 
place so far away, the distance cannot be measured, and he is so old 
that only one other person on this planet exceeds his age. The early 
years of his life, he was harassed and scorned by the other children of 
the village, and was daily beat by them. When he was ten, his mother 
died of illness, and his father blamed him. Malchior was sent into exile 
from his home.

For days, he wandered&#151;hungry, alone, and cold&#151;until, quite by accident, 
he stepped on the wrong tract of peat, and fell through, right into the 
tomb of an evil king. It was in that tomb that he discovered the Book of 
Shadows. Although illiterate, he taught himself to read using that book. 
When he emerged from the dark of the tomb, five years later, he was 
changed. His eyes blazed with power, and he could defy the very laws of 
God Himself&#151;extending or shortening life, controlling aging. Days later, 
an army of corpses raided his former village and burned it to the 
ground. He made sure there were no survivors.

Since then, he has lived much the same for years. He has traveled often, 
and often

rubbed elbows with the movers and shakers of history. He has always 
craved power, and yet he has only been able to have power in certain, 
often covert ways. Many times, he has had to flee his &quot;kingdoms of the 
dead&quot; as he calls them, to escape the church. Over time, he has had many 
lovers. But his one great love was a young girl from another country, 
long ago and far away. She, like him, had been scorned&#151;for her scarred 
face&#151;and had fled in her youth. He had found her in the woods, scared 
and alone. Feeling pity for her, he took her in, and taught her magic. 
She was one who understood him, who did not judge him, who loved him 
unconditionally. He healed her scarred face, and she helped to heal his 
scarred past. As she grew, so did their relationship. They loved each 
other, and thought that it would last forever. Sadly, an inquisitor 
captured her when she left him to go find a new city to live in. She was 
burned at the stake.

He mourned her loss, and his inability to do anything. There was no 
corpse to revive for even a zombie form, and her soul had disappeared. 
Her name was Venus, a name that he had given her. Ever since her death, 
Malichoir has poured himself into further studies, trying to find some 
way, any way, to bring her back. His best theory thus far was to store 
her spirit in a new vessel. This is where Kali came in&#151;but in order to 
totally realize his plan, he needed two bodies that would eventually 
fuse, through some means, into one&#151;which is where Kali&#39;s lost sister 
Celine comes in. The first time that Malchior attempted to revive his 
lost love, it was about two-hundred of our years ago, on a very distant 
planet called Earth.

Several exceptional people from this planet were able to put a stop to 
Malchior, but it took far greater powers to destroy Kali. Defeated but 
undaunted, Malchior picked up the remains of his first experiment and 
went into hiding, until Celine died from old age. He then bided his time 
until the technology of Earth was advanced enough to remove him from the 
planet&#151;for he had gained too many enemies over the course of his long 
life, and reviving his &quot;daughters&quot; required a world with a different 
flow of life. This led to their second incarnation, upon a planet that 
is now lost. The two sisters, while only mild rivals on Earth, were 
bitter enemies in this new world, and destroyed the planet and each 
other. Malchior was left to face defeat a second time.

He relocated before the world was wiped out, and recently settled on 
this planet, drawn by its radical surges of unusual power&#151;for on this 
planet, as many of you have noticed, exist many people whose abilities 
far exceed those of other people. This seemed to be the ideal place to 
set his design into motion, so once again he set to work. This is where 
the third and present incarnation of Kali comes into being, and by far 
the most powerful. As to where her sister is... Well, only Celine 
herself knows that, if indeed she knows anything.

And now, let me tell you a brief history of this planet, from its 
conception to the present era. Long ago, before our star Zeruel was 
placed in its position, Kurios the Almighty brought forth from the 
Father Star the Parents, Father and Mother. Almighty Kurios showed the 
expanse of darkness to the Parents, saying that such desolation needed 
life, or else it would have no purpose. The Creator then instructed 
Father to enter the sacred garden, which no mortal may step into without 
His approval, and retrieve the fruit that would bear Celestial Seeds&#151;the 
beginnings of a star system.

Father took the fruit, and buried it in the soil, and Mother helped 
nurture it in its earthly womb. However, the fruit was incomplete&#151;in his 
desire to taste the fruit, Father created sin: the sin of disobedience, 
as well as the sin of false testimony and the sin of irresponsibility. 
Therefore the star system was incomplete, and sin purged the new world 
quickly. Father and Mother were then given a task: to guide and instruct 
their children, to give the strong a throne and the weak a scepter, and 
to await the day when the perfection of the world could be realized. 
When Father and Mother perished, their bodies were planted deep in the 
world&#39;s core, wherein it was given the name of Gaios, &quot;our world&quot;. It is 
said that they will wake again when the world ends, their bodies and 
souls at last perfect.

As for their children, they were divided in two, although one group was 
not better than the other. They were called the Strong and the Weak, and 
were both assigned roles that suited them. Since the Strong vastly 
outnumbered the Weak, they were assigned to rule over the whole world, 
to govern their fellow brothers and sisters atop a throne. The Weak were 
then compensated for their losses by being bestowed incredible powers 
that enabled them to fight&#151;not only for the Strong, but for themselves. 
This is their scepter, this is their destiny. All creatures in this 
world that have exceptional powers are known as &quot;the Weak&quot;. All 
creatures that do not&#151;in other words, the so-called &quot;normal humans&quot;&#151;they 
are known as &quot;the Strong&quot;. Strong and Weak cannot live without each 
other.

However, now there is a third category: &quot;The Evolved&quot;. One person saw to 
it that she could improve upon the genetic build of the Strong, to give 
them powers that not only met those of the Weak but exceeded them as 
well. She experimented on many subjects&#151;Kristen Masterson, Alisti 
Kreager, Shalis Torth, Jane Brewe, the Lurker-child, Hsu Kai Lin, Joyce 
Jameson&#151;but only found perfection with two; that is of course Marissa 
and Sanaa, and the researcher in charge of the entire project was none 
other than Dr. Yohko Kamaguchi herself! It was she who created these new 
beings, those that were both Strong and Weak&#151;a combination of the two, 
utilizing all the best parts to evolve even further, in the hopes that 
soon every human being would become like them! Yes, yes, this is her 
plan, but it is not all of it. She experimented on one other person, and 
to this day is experimenting on them.

I will now confirm what a few of you have already suspected from the 
start: I am not only none of these three, but am something so totally 
different that I shall not describe it, for I know that none of you will 
believe me. I was sent here to this world for four reasons: I was to 
gather those that I knew were &quot;Lost&quot;, to shield them and to love them 
and to see to it that through my intervention, they would have another 
chance at life. I was also assigned to destroy Kali, and to send 
Malchior to judgment. My third assignment was to find the rogue angel 
Pale, to bring before Almighty Kurios, and the fourth...

My final task upon this world is the act of battling the dark one, 
Omega, and his legion of cultists. Yes, that is why I am truly here. But 
I was forbidden to do these tasks alone, so I gathered aides. You, the 
Lost, were not the first; I had others well before your time. You know 
them as the Dead Zodiac, twelve so-called apostles of mine that I 
gathered to help with these four tasks. I must admit, you have all 
performed marvelously against them, slaying all but four. Ezekiel, my 
right-hand man, has foreseen much of this; he is a great soothsayer from 
yet another world, neither Gaios nor Earth, but from a land where a 
power called &quot;magic&quot; exists, called Galroth. It is this magic which 
gives him his abnormal abilities, but even they pale in comparison to my 
own. Well, I suppose I have said enough for you all to linger on for 
some time. The day has grown long, has it not? And if I am not mistaken, 
we have one more guest to attend to. I think one among you has been 
calling for her.

Mr. White&#151;Nort&#151;Alpha&#151;Thirteen&#151;he was correct in saying this. The group 
knew it to be true; their guest was right in front of them. Five in 
their number knew her at once, for they had fought her, and the only 
survivor could not have identified her face, but rather knew her by her 
black aura. Not a single soul in the room, save Mr. White himself, stood 
firm against her; they all quivered in fright, for they faced the bane 
of all living things, the goddess of death and the instrument of sorrow, 
Kali herself.

She had found them.
