<p>VOLUME TWO: RIVALS AND RELATIONSHIPS</p>
<p>“Rise of the Jackal: a rival hunter spells trouble!”</p>
<p>Aseria  Tolan expected a long line waiting to read the Tome of Treasures, so  she was amazed to discover conditions to the contrary: the book was  just lying there, unused. She picked the unremarkable-looking book up  and opened it, breathing sharply as beautiful holographic pictures  blinked to life. Since by that point in history, the only paper books  were antiques kept in museums (or by deranged fans), it wasn’t unusual  to see interactive three-dimensional images leaping out from the  covers, but only a few civilizations could boast a quality this  immaculate. The pictures were not hazy or monochromatic like the  pioneering holos had been around half a millennium ago; these were so  real that Aseria felt like she could touch and smell them.</p>
<p>“Now  which trinket are we after today?” she wondered aloud. Not even the  Tome of Treasures could respond to a question like that, but if she  changed it to, “Please show me which artifact was researched last,” the  image would switch to the last page that had been opened, thus leading  her to figure out their destination. Rachel had apparently selected a  location very close by, but Aseria was unfamiliar with the planet and  the item it guarded. She made a mental note of it and then asked the  Tome to look up anything pertaining to the worlds of Valar.</p>
<p>Ever since she was a child, Aseria had heard the story of the lost Dreadnought <em>Valhalla</em>, the “throne of heroes”, which was rumored to be hidden beneath the waves of Alfheim’s vast oceans. As the legend goes, <em>Valhalla</em> was a vessel that originated from an incredibly ancient, vastly  superior race, and had been drawn to her home world in the hopes of  communicating with Aseria’s primordial ancestors, who were perhaps the  most advanced people in the galaxy at the time (their technology was on  par with ancient Egypt’s). Somehow, <em>Valhalla</em> became trapped on  Alfheim and ended up becoming a tomb for the thousands of warriors who  were its crew, thus the name “throne of heroes”. Theories abounded  concerning its validity, location, age, purpose, and contents, but  since there was no scientific evidence of an actual vessel down in the  depths, the entry for <em>Valhalla</em> was labeled UNCONFIRMED.</p>
<p>As  she researched that familiar story, Aseria picked up sounds of a  visitor. The footsteps were very familiar and she smiled quietly as she  waited for those protective arms to wrap around her. She winced  slightly as she felt her chest being squeezed: Lillianne had very  strange ways of showing her affection.</p>
<p>“Couldn’t help yourself, huh?” Aseria closed the book, removed her friend’s hands, and turned to smile at her.</p>
<p>“I was just curious. Don’t tell me you haven’t stolen a peek yourself.”</p>
<p>“I  thumbed through it. I didn’t expect it to have anything about Mu in it,  but it seems I was wrong.” Aseria knew very little about Lil’s home  planet, aside from the scant details provided by its sole native. Gaean  legends mentioned it several times as a prehistoric, advanced city,  lost in the cloud of time along with Atlantis and Shangri-La. Even the  Tome of Treasures called Mu an “unconfirmed world that might have  existed at one time”, but Lillianne swore to it and Aseria believed her  implicitly.</p>
<p>“But it’s not much,” she admitted with a shrug. “Come  on, we can fool around with that later. We’ve landed and I wanna  stretch my legs. That means you’re going.”</p>
<p>“But what if I don’t want to?” Lil grinned dangerously; she had seduced people before with that wild smile.</p>
<p>“Who  says I gave you a choice?” She quickly picked the squealing Aseria in  her arms, placing one hand on her back and another on her rear, and  carried her to the meeting room.</p>
<p>“At least tell me where we’re going!” laughed the elf.</p>
<p>“I  have no idea; I’ve never heard of it. Some obscure world nearby.  There’s some valuable bust there that’s worth about ten K in gold. I  figured it was a waste of time, but I really need some exercise. You’re  starting to look a little pudgy yourself.”</p>
<p>“What do you care?”  Aseria pouted as she was placed down (Lil giving her rear one last  squeeze). “You said you’d love me no matter what.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but when I get you in bed, I don’t want you wearing out on me before I can work my magic.”</p>
<p>“Stop  it,” she whispered, pushing Lil away. The pointed ears of the  elf-people are incredibly sensitive and are sometimes regarded as  objects of worship in sexual foreplay. Merely buzzing in a sultry voice  or touching them suggestively can cause a pleasant reaction, so  Aseria’s face was quite flushed.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Lil grinned. “We’re all girls here, and it’s not like we’ve never slept together before.”</p>
<p>“You’re  embarrassing me, and it’s inappropriate.” What began as playful  bantering turned into a lover’s quarrel—except that neither woman would  say she was expressly in love with the other. They had a complicated  relationship and it only grew worse with the addition of about twenty  other women, who shared their space and saw them interact every day.</p>
<p>Dr.  Fujiwara greeted everyone in Amy’s place, and explained that Miss  Miracle was not feeling very well. She was in agony because of her  injury, and no matter what Fuuka tried, her efforts were never  effective for long. She could relieve Amy of the pain for a few hours,  clean the wound, and dress the bandages, but the cut refused to heal  and the blood continued to trickle. She had never been so baffled in  her whole life, and the only reason she didn’t express greater  concern—aside from Athena’s awkward assurances—was that the injury was  really not so bad, just a nuisance.</p>
<p>“We’ll be arriving on Olria  soon,” Fujiwara said to the crew. “According to the tome, the treasure  we’re after is the bust of the UCM’s very first director, Yade Sterling  of Epitaph. It went missing three years ago in Fourth City and there’s  currently a reward of 10,000G for it. While this may seem like a poor  way to start this adventure, I believe that taking gentle steps early  on will prepare us for future endeavors. This is also a good time for  everyone else to bring up their own suggestions. For those of you who  wish to leave, Kay and Tee Acheron will drive you to the bust’s last  known location. They will be taking volunteers presently.”</p>
<p>“Ooh, ooh, me, me, pick me!” Shana exclaimed. “Epitaph is my home world! I know all about Mr. Sterling! Let me go, let me go!”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll pass,” Naja yawned. “Olria is such a backwater. I’m gonna go shed now, so if anybody interrupts—“</p>
<p>“You’ll kill them, we know.” Everyone groaned; Allegra had performed her task quite well, and Naja made sure they never forgot.</p>
<p>“Aseria  and I are going,” Lil said. The dark-skinned elf smiled feebly. It was  pointless to argue; Lil stuck to her friend like a habit. A breeze  suddenly kicked up, battering and blowing around anything not held down  fast (Chandra purred as several skirts were buffeted), and Rachel the  genie appeared out of the little storm, crashing into the wall and  falling flat on her face.</p>
<p>“Oww… Did somebody say we were going  somewhere?” Vimmy was at her side at once, but not because she was  concerned for Rachel’s health.</p>
<p>“Oh my, are you all right, that  was a nasty smash you went through, yes indeed, but I’m glad you didn’t  knock my hair off, did you break any bones, you seem to be all right,  Mink dear, if she’s going with the team, perhaps you should follow her  to make sure she’s, ahh, taken care of, I don’t want her to be in poor  health, she’s a valuable crewmember, run along now, I’ll be fine right  here.”</p>
<p>“You know she won’t grant you any wishes, master,” Mink  sighed. She helped Rachel up anyway and made sure she was okay. Clumsy  genies are not as uncommon as you might think—in fact, Rachel was  almost a stereotype.</p>
<p>“Thank you, you’re very kind,” she said to  Mink, who just nodded. “So who else is going? Do we count the Acheron  sisters as two people or just one?”</p>
<p>“Count me in,” Eve said  wearily. “I’ve had my nose crammed in circuitry for the past several  hours; I need some sun. Just don’t expect me to get friendly with any  of you!” Of course, the real reason she wanted to leave was to avoid  Chandra, whom she felt oddly repulsed by, and to avoid Herut, who was  no doubt ashamed of Eve’s fornication. But she was welcomed regardless  and the crew set off since no more volunteers came forth (Chandra  wanted to follow, but she also wanted to try and seduce several other  women, and pleasure units are not very consistent with their conquests).</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>Shana  Suing stared idly at her chatting companions as the Acheron’s vehicle  tumbled and rolled across the Olrian landscape. This section of the  world was dark and drizzly, thanks to an overcast sky that foreshadowed  storms to come. The cities were grimy, polluted, wet, and overcrowded  with grizzly, gnarled people, their stares cold and their greetings  curt. It was a bleak, bleary world, but the weather probably  contributed to this dystopian atmosphere. No doubt that on a sunny day,  the best and brightest would be out to give the travelers a better  impression of their world.</p>
<p>Self-portraits were not Shana’s style.  She only saw herself one way, and that perception never changed,  because only she saw herself for what she was; a painting would not  really depict what others wanted to see. But she sketched everyone else  once she was finished painting the landscape of Olrian. She doubted her  audience would like this gray, empty world, but she wanted to record  everything for posterity. First on her list was Rachel, the  surprisingly bouncy and bubbly genie. She sat grinning and rocking in  the car, eager for the adventure to start, her exotic clothes and  roasted skin blatantly standing out against the pallor around her. She  smelled heavenly but was not successful in making friends: most of the  passengers were used to people staying out of their affairs.</p>
<p>Aseria  and Lillianne came next; she grouped them together since it didn’t feel  right creating separate entries for them. Lil’s eyes glimmered like  bullion, two spherical treasures that hid dark secrets and wild  passions, and her heliotrope mane, when not held up for prudence’s  sake, slithered all the way to her ankles and could almost substitute  as a robe (Shana was fairly jealous). While her attitude was prickly,  selfish, and scathing, she was certainly pleasing to the eyes, boasting  a voluptuous, seductive body, sculpted perfectly through years of  vigorous martial arts training, milky white and glowing with radiance.  Her favorite hobby, aside from talking down to others and clinging to  Aseria, was dressing up and modeling her clothes—she was as vain as a  peacock. She claimed that most natives of Mu looked like her, but she  couldn’t prove this.</p>
<p>Aseria Tolan was as proud and beautiful and  mysterious as the rest of her elvish kin. Her eyes were like oceans,  deep and dark and deadly, and her hair cascaded to her waist (yet  another person with enviable locks!); she was nearly a living  waterfall. She was smaller and slightly lighter than her  second-in-command, and despite her frail appearance and strategic  knowledge, she was Lil’s match in combat and the two sparred fairly  often (which usually included swapping sexual innuendo). Unlike  Lillianne, her skin was quite black, but not unattractive in the least;  she had a more honest beauty surrounding her and might have passed as  “the girl next door” if she weren’t a Captain of the Sindar Special  Defense Forces, one of the major branches of the UCM. She also dressed  sensibly and professionally—to impress and not to seduce—but she  quivered with a malicious light that pierced her kind appearance.</p>
<p>Eve  Kasberry was the only person in the transport Shana could call a  friend. She had already sketched her before but wanted to see if there  was anything she missed. She had fair skin from working so many hours  indoors, and her clothes—even the cleanest ones—were stained with oil,  antifreeze, lubricant, and grease. She was quite muscular but not  necessarily masculine; her single blue eye glowed with a feminine  sparkle (the other had been lost in an accident and had to be  replaced), and her face, when not scowling sarcastically or tight with  concentration, was actually nice to look at. The whole of her left leg  and her lower right leg were also artificial, covered with  synthetically produced tissue (which came in handy when they were all  fighting those Executioners). All of this made her a very intimidating  character, but both Shana and Herut (and Chandra, to an extent) knew  that behind this rough curtain was a good soul.</p>
<p>Mink had a  simple, plain beauty about her, and in spite of her emotionless  expressions, she was very receptive and friendly, eager to lend a hand  and take care of anybody who needed her. Shana was glad that Vimmy  appreciated and praised her gray-skinned servant so highly, although  she still didn’t understand how the two polar opposites met, or got  along for that matter! Mink was fairly tall for a woman and, except for  the shade of her skin and her short, simple mop of white hair, she  could easily pass for a human. Her eyes were dark but very gentle, her  voice was steady and slightly husky, and she was much stronger than she  looked. Shana beamed at her, trying to coax out a little smile. Mink’s  lips twitched just long enough for her to capture the humble woman’s  spirit.</p>
<p>The Acheron twins were much harder to portray. Shana  wanted to make them look attractive and not freakish, but she had never  painted conjoined twins before, and Kay and Tee were dicephalic: the  two women merged so perfectly that they shared a single body but had  two heads between them. They had very distinct personalities and tried  to customize their appearance to avoid confusion: Kayleigh, the woman  on Shana’s left, was soft-spoken and let her dyed-black hair grow long;  Teleah, the woman on Shana’s right, was more outspoken and harsh, and  had short dyed turquoise hair. There were surgical scars on their neck,  chest, and back, indicating the sorts of troubles they had been  through, but these were covered by a custom-made black flight suit that  allowed each twin her own collar. The sisters were armed, but for the  moment, their hands were steering the vehicle.</p>
<p>“Shit, girl,” Lil  murmured as Shana displayed them. “You’re good! That’s some real talent  right there! Aseria, check this out! Not even the Sindar could match  this!”</p>
<p>“That remains to be seen,” she muttered cynically. The  sapphire-haired elf flipped through the sketches mechanically and  handed them back to the artist. “Impressive. Where did you learn how to  do this?”</p>
<p>“I just practiced a lot.”</p>
<p>“You’re self-taught? That is impressive.”</p>
<p>“Plus I have a really good memory, and an eye for detail.”</p>
<p>“It shows. Well, I don’t mean to sound like a brat, but how much farther do you two think it is?”</p>
<p>“Keep  your shirt on,” Tee grumbled. She looked back and grimaced: whoops, bad  choice of words. Lil was grinning perversely. “Just hang tight. Keep in  mind that once we reach the place, we’ll have to start searching for  clues. Unless we’re too late, nobody’s seen this bust in three years.”</p>
<p>“I think the book would’ve mentioned it if the bust had been found,” Kay noted.</p>
<p>“Probably, but who knows. There’s the city, elf-girl! Lil, please tell me you didn’t—“</p>
<p>“No, but she tried,” Aseria muttered. Lil grinned and winked at the others, but not everyone thought it was so funny.</p>
<p>Because  three years had passed since Fourth City lost its prized treasure,  leads were dry, clues were scarce, and people had basically given up on  finding it. A new bust was being made in the meantime, though there  were groups opposed to the recreation. These fanatics insisted that the  search continue—and if it could not, then all attempts at remaking the  bust should cease in order to preserve its original memory. But these  people were in the minority and so the new sculpture was underway. This  led the travelers to scout out the locations of those against the  recreation, but they had been searching hard ever since the artifact  first turned up missing three years ago.</p>
<p>“We kept it in our  museum, along with all the other pieces,” explained one of the members.  “Once there was a time when we displayed all sorts of commemorative  paraphernalia concerning the history of our galaxy, and Sterling’s bust  was one of our most prizes pieces.”</p>
<p>“Did somebody take it?” Shana asked. The man rubbed his chin.</p>
<p>“That’s  what we believe. Three years ago, we redesigned the UCM wing of the  museum and had to move everything to an undisclosed location. We  thought we had recovered everything when the construction was finished,  but a few days later, we discovered someone had switched the real bust  with a facsimile. We’re still not sure if it’s robbery or just a prank,  but all this time has gone by and we still haven’t solved the case.”</p>
<p>“What  does the bust look like?” He showed Shana a picture and she memorized  its details perfectly. The galaxy had been a fairly lawless place for  several centuries before the major powers banded together and formed a  single unified military force, and Yade Sterling, who had been current  ruler of Shana’s home world back then, was first elected to lead the  organization. That had been centuries ago, well before the first  rockets from Earth penetrated the heavens, so a bust of Sterling was  naturally very valuable. Aseria suggested they examine the room where  the items had been stored, but Olrian police and detective forces had  already combed every inch of the room, and every other room they could  think of. Security cameras had shown no interference and nobody had  broken through security on that fateful night, which led most people to  believe the switch happened before everything was moved out.</p>
<p>“We  suspected an employee,” he continued, “but we performed tight  background checks on everyone, and we’ve even searched their homes. Ah,  here’s one of them now. Nanette, these people are asking about the  Sterling bust. Could you take over for me please? Don’t worry, I’m not  ducking out or anything!” He smiled thinly and left the crew to speak  with this new woman. Shana and Eve were stricken by how pretty she was,  and how warmly she treated them all. She looked everyone in the eye and  was even able to charm Lillianne, though she was forbidden to approach  Aseria. Only Mink showed no reaction, but inwardly, she was happy to be  in the company of such a sophisticated lady.</p>
<p>“Before you start  asking, I can guarantee that none of the employees were involved,” she  said. “Even if one of us did steal it, why would we keep it since we’re  so devoted to its preservation? Everyone here is against the bust’s  recreation, including the curator. It’s everything or nothing with us;  we won’t accept anything in between.”</p>
<p>“Sounds stubborn to me,” Lil muttered, though she raised an impressed eyebrow. Nanette glowed warmly and grinned.</p>
<p>“Yes,  I know, but like I said, we’re all devoted. I’ve actually performed a  little private research myself, and I was hoping I could have some  assistance—if you’ll be so kind.”</p>
<p>“That’s what we came here for,”  Aseria said. Everyone followed her except Rachel, who had been soaking  everything up. She wondered if magic had anything to do with this  disappearance, as doubtful as it was. She didn’t sense any on that  world, but that didn’t always mean there wasn’t any at all.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>Eve  had been fascinated by Nanette’s presence ever since she first glided  into sight, and she could scarcely rip her eyes away without yearning  for another look. Many women aboard the <em>Dauntless</em> were beauties  beyond compare, and quite a few had good, pure hearts, bursting with  love—but Nanette seemed beyond all this as the majestic lion is beyond  the common alley cat. She invited everyone to her home and gave them  the tour of her investigation, but while they were busy piecing  together these clues, she gravitated to Eve’s side, gave her a  heart-stopping grin, and leaned forward to whisper:</p>
<p>“So, are you  in it for the money or the fun? Or maybe you’re the bandit and you’ve  come to confess.” Her eyes squinted as her cheeks glowed; she was a  merry, sensual, attractive creature, nearly a goddess and yet humble  and wholesome. She didn’t seem disturbed by Eve’s appearance and even  appeared quite at ease. Eve had been deceived before, however, and kept  her distance, suspicious of people who favored her for no reason.</p>
<p>“The first two, I guess. So is everybody this committed, or just you?”</p>
<p>“I  don’t know. I’ve never been to their houses. But I believe them when  they say they want to recover this bust. Olria was nothing until they  decided to build that museum. It’s the only thing that keeps us from  slipping back to the Silicon Age. I still can’t believe somebody would  desecrate our only significant source of culture like this…but to tell  you the truth, the bust isn’t the only artifact that was ‘misplaced’.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” Nanette nodded.</p>
<p>“The  museum has lost seventeen other items under different circumstances.  Sometimes they’re recovered, other times they’re not, and once in  awhile, we get a practical joker who sends us a fake. Compared to the  Sterling bust, however, everything else is meaningless. He was the  first director of the UCM.” She gazed at Eve again, and this time,  there was no questioning her intent. She was obviously checking her out  and even the jaded mechanic caught on. She physically backed away, her  mind awhirl with doubts.</p>
<p>“Oh—uh—yes. So…you said you needed some assistance?”</p>
<p>“Yes  please. I may have found the location, but it would be impossible for  me to get there by myself, and anyway, if I brought it back without any  witnesses, people would suspect me.”</p>
<p>“So why not get your friends at the museum to help?”</p>
<p>“One,  nobody believes me. I was hoping you could have a little faith in me,  Eve.” (Oh, how her ears burned when she heard that!) “Two, they’re all  so busy with their own theories that they couldn’t help me even if they  wanted to. Third…well, let’s just say that normal people wouldn’t be  able to reach it anyway. Eve, I know this is forward of me, and quite  sudden—maybe even a bit impolite—but you and your friends are the only  people who can help me. You’ve got so much free time and you’re clearly  capable of handling whatever life throws at you. I just need your  faith.”</p>
<p>Asking Eve Kasberry to believe in anybody except herself  was normally a fatal request. She understood the dark, selfish side of  humanity all too well, and had seen what happened to people who were  lulled by a similar song. Her own father was the perfect example of  human scum: he appeared virtuous and caring on the outside, but when  the doors were closed and the eyes were off him, he was a vehement  isolationist, and even more xenophobic and racist than the Elshyrin.  She had nearly been destroyed by his beliefs; there was no way she  would be sucked back into that world.</p>
<p>“Look somewhere else, lady,” she muttered. “I’ve given up on faith.”</p>
<p>“Then  at least come along and judge for yourself. Don’t people say that  actions speak louder than words?” She caressed Eve’s hand and looked  directly into her eyes. Eve cursed her attraction to pretty women and  agreed to Nanette’s request. She wouldn’t even have to trust her; she  could just be there keeping watch over the situation. Nanette thanked  her with a smile, and touched Eve’s face with the sincerity and love of  a saint. For a moment, Eve hoped she’d be kissed by this angelic  being…but maybe it was better that she didn’t. It made the desire grow  stronger still.</p>
<p>“So how did you find the location?” asked Shana  innocently. Nanette had apparently forgotten about everyone else, and  turned round to attend to them. Shana also liked this older woman and  even had a little crush on her, not that Eve could really feel sore  about it.</p>
<p>“Making contacts, exploring, asking questions,  following clues… Three years of hard work, whenever I could. In the  end, though, it’s just a theory. I can’t prove it, but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ll come along anyway! I’ve got nothing else to do, and this sounds like fun! Are you all with me?”</p>
<p>“Definitely,”  Lil grinned—and that meant Aseria would be along for the side. Mink  merely nodded, and Rachel bounced up and down. Only the Acheron sisters  were skeptical, but Nanette wasn’t offended.</p>
<p>“I don’t blame you.  I’ve tried to be scientific about this, but I can only go so far. The  rest is merely a belief and a hope. You don’t have to come.”</p>
<p>“If you need a driver…” Kay started to say, but Tee interrupted her.</p>
<p>“Why not? We did volunteer for this job, after all.”</p>
<p>“Um, yes, we did.”</p>
<p>“Great. Come along and I’ll show you where I think it may be.”</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>The  ocean did seem like a logical choice to dump a valuable treasure, so  nobody was surprised when Nanette rented a submarine and gave her  suggested coordinates to the Acherons. Shana instantly busied herself  drawing the marine world and found it to be a delightful alternative to  the drab surface (she even did Nanette’s beauty some justice). Lil was  quickly growing bored and started to complain; Aseria assigned herself  the difficult task of soothing her (she was the only one that could)  and tried to balance the pure love she was sure she felt and the  forbidden lust she wanted to conquer. Kay and Tee were left alone, as  always, since Nanette seemed to favor Eve’s company, but they had her  coordinates and they didn’t require any further assistance. Mink was  her usual patient, stoic self, and kept Shana company since she seemed  to appreciate the beauty of the natural world just as much.</p>
<p>“Can  I ask you a question, Eve?” Nanette said. She spoke graciously and  politely, like one who always considered the needs of others. Even her  posture and body language gave the impression of tranquility and  safety. Either she was trying to assure Eve that she could be trusted,  or else setting her up for the biggest disappointment yet. But Kasberry  was weak; she hadn’t felt this much attention lavished on her since  leaving Chandra in bed, and she craved the genuine love and affection  Nanette was no doubt willing to give her.</p>
<p>“I guess so,” she answered numbly. Again with the disarming smile…</p>
<p>“Are  you afraid of me or something? You seem to keep your defenses up. I’m  sorry if I’m prying; I just…like you for some reason. Call it an  attraction.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m an infamous mechanic?” she snorted. Nanette grinned.</p>
<p>“I  didn’t even know you were infamous. No offense, but I’ve never heard of  you. You just seem…attractive. You’re not only beautiful, intelligent,  and independent, but…there’s something that drew me to you. I’m not  sure what it was.”</p>
<p>“These babies most likely!” she said, lifting  her pants up and knocking on her mechanical legs. Nanette smiled  patiently and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m not that kind of woman. I’m  sorry if I can’t describe it better. So are you going to answer my  question?” Eve sighed and uncrossed her arms. Only two people knew her  as more than just a moody, distant mechanic. She wasn’t sure if she was  capable of adding a third.</p>
<p>“I’m just not used to being around people,” she mumbled.</p>
<p>“But what about all these people here?”</p>
<p>“We just…work together. I don’t have that many friends—maybe two or three.”</p>
<p>“Think  you could add another?” Eve actually blushed as Nanette scooted closer.  This was different from being eyed by Chandra: a pleasure unit doesn’t  know any other life than the one they were given, but normal humans  have a choice, and if it was really Nanette’s choice to be in love with  Eve…</p>
<p>“Miss Nanette, we’re here!” Kay called suddenly. What rotten timing.</p>
<p>“I  don’t see anything,” Tee grunted. “You sure we’re in the right place?”  Nanette sighed quietly and excused herself, leaving Eve to recover her  racing heartbeat.</p>
<p>“Do you see that large pile of rubble down  there? If my theory is correct, our thief hid it here after lifting it  from the museum. You see, I believe they took off with it and replaced  it with a fake long before the renovation.”</p>
<p>“It would be the most  probable solution,” the twins admitted. They steered the sub as close  as they could, and carefully reached its grappler arm out to brush away  the debris. Boulders, chunks of coral, and the remains of a small boat  were all piled together, most likely caused by an accident. Kay smiled  faintly as she tried to guess how this could come about.</p>
<p>“It seems they ran into some trouble.”</p>
<p>“That’d explain why they hid it here to throw off the trail,” Tee added. “How’d you figure all this out, anyway?”</p>
<p>“I  saw it on the news, of course,” Nanette tittered. “There was a story  awhile back of a burglary. The report said the crook got away on a  boat, but there was no mention of a wreck, so nobody bothered to check  the seabed. But even if they did, doesn’t that pile look natural?”</p>
<p>“The perfect place to hide a smuggled treasure,” Kay said.</p>
<p>“But how did you know it’d be under this pile?” Nanette laughed gaily at the twins.</p>
<p>“My,  aren’t we suspicious? Actually, even I didn’t know about the wreck; I  just pinpointed these coordinates because I overheard the friend of a  friend talking about hearing a disturbance. Most people thought it was  a shark or a dugong, and it usually is. It may not actually be under  this—“</p>
<p>“I found something,” Kay said. The twins had been picking  away for awhile and uncovered a secret passage that had been blocked by  the boulders. It was large enough for the submarine to pass into, and  after puttering beneath the seabed for a moment, it came out in a  cavern. A pocket of air seeped in through the winding labyrinth, so  everyone got out to investigate. Nanette shivered like one who was  anxiously waiting the unveiling of a terrific secret, and she took  Eve’s hand for comfort. Eve attempted to smile and tried to be gentle,  but with her rough hands… Nanette didn’t seem to mind, though, and  grinned quite sweetly.</p>
<p>“Ooh,” Shana sang. “You’re holding hands already? You sure move fast!”</p>
<p>“Be  quiet,” Lil sighed. “Public displays of affection are a lost art.  Right, Aseria?” She reached out and smacked the elf’s bottom, causing  her to jump. Rachel laughed while Mink just stood there, impassive as  ever. Nobody could tell if she was amused or irritated. Once everyone’s  nerves had calmed down, they made their way into a cavern and  discovered quite a trove of treasures stockpiled there. Not only was  the bust waiting for them, but there were manuscripts, medals,  uniforms, scale models, holo-tomes, personal effects, and all sorts of  items pertaining to the history of the military. Even the most jaded  among them paused to soak all this in—one felt like sinking down and  scooping everything up like grains of sand on a beach.</p>
<p>“This is certainly serendipitous,” Aseria murmured.</p>
<p>“Yeah, really. It’s like a ‘find one, get fifteen free’ treasure hunt. So Nanette, are we going to load all these up?”</p>
<p>“If you would, please. And be careful: we can’t replace anything here, no matter what the heathens think.”</p>
<p>“Get  a grip, lady!” Shana chortled as they started loading. “It’s just a  pile of junk. It’s not like these are holy relics or anything.” Loading  everything onto the submarine was more difficult without Rachel’s  assistance. Shana begged her to use her magic, but she declined.</p>
<p>“I only use it when I need to. You can carry these things yourselves—and I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>“That’s  no fun,” she muttered. Eventually it was all packed up and ready to go.  The trip back was considerably easier than the descent: Kay and Tee  just had to surface and head towards the shore. When they docked,  Nanette stood to congratulate everyone, even going so far as to give  Eve a hug. Shana cooed mischievously and winked at them both; Eve  rolled her eyes and quickly jerked back. Nanette’s bracelet was flung  off her wrist as Eve tossed herself away, and since she felt guilty for  rejecting what could possibly be her first real lover, Eve bent down to  pick it up.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh,” Rachel said as Eve raised the bracelet up.  “Bad move.” Nobody expected it to be rigged with sleep gas, and they  had no time to struggle or escape before the toxins took their effect.  Nanette calmly placed a mask over her face, pulled out a cell phone,  and made the call she had promised several hours earlier.</p>
<p>“It’s  me. The plan worked. Thanks for telling me about them. …I found  everything, so come on over to my place whenever you like. …My cover’s  probably blown, so I’ll need a ride out. …No, I just knocked them out.  They’re all right; I’m not a killer. Besides, I think I might be in  love with one of them. …Yeah, I know. I’ll be expecting you soon.” She  bent down and stuffed a note in Eve’s hand, then held her breath,  lifting her mask just long enough to touch her soft lips to Eve’s  mouth. She only paused for a moment to see Rachel glaring at her,  unaffected by the gas but not in any hurry to stop her.</p>
<p>“Can I help you?” she asked. The Ifritah just growled.</p>
<p>“They trusted you, you know. Evie’s gonna be heartbroken when she wakes up.”</p>
<p>“It’s  nothing personal—and I didn’t hurt any of them. Just think of me as…a  rival, nothing more. And tell that sweet Dr. Miracle that the Jackal  says hello.” The woman who called herself Nanette opened the submarine  door and loaded everything out long before anyone could wake up. Rachel  sighed and fanned as much of the fog out as she could. She wanted to  stop the woman, but she had to take care of the crew first—and besides,  their rival had only succeeded for the time being!</p>
<p align="center"><strong>……</strong></p>
<p>             Eve woke up in a nearby Olrian hospital, surrounded by people who  looked vaguely familiar.  She definitely recognized the serene, foxy  face of Dr. Fujiwara, and moaned softly as Shana and Herut shared the  task of tending to her.  She numbly remembered hugging Nanette, then  dropping something, then there was…well, there was a whole lot of  nothing for a long time.  But now she was awake, encircled by her  companions, still quite unsure if this was a dream.</p>
<p>             “Did you enjoy your rest?” Fuuka asked.  “You slept longer than the  others.  They’re already onboard; Rachel called me down here once she  carried everyone out of the sub.”</p>
<p>            “Slept?” Eve moaned.  Her mouth was dry and she whispered for a drink.</p>
<p>             “Yes.  You succumbed to an anesthetic that doctors use in operations.   From what Rachel told me, the toxin spewed out of beads in a bracelet  worn by a…well, I suppose it was a rival.”</p>
<p>            “Nanette?” she groaned.  Eve suddenly felt sick, and not from her prolonged sleep.</p>
<p>             “It turns out that was a fake name,” Shana said.  “She was actually  working undercover in that museum for three years.  She was the one  responsible for stealing all those artifacts.”</p>
<p>             “That’s impossible,” Eve whispered as she stood up.  Her head swam as  the blood swished around, suddenly stirred after such a long rest, and  Herut gently placed her back on the bed.</p>
<p>            “Maybe you  should read her letter.  She left it for you after knocking everyone  out.”  This was the same note the woman slipped into Eve’s hand; she  unfolded it numbly and started reading.</p>
<p><em>“Eve—</em></p>
<p><em>“Try  and be professional about this.  I didn’t mean to harm any of you; I  just needed someone who could drive a sub down to where I hid  everything I stole for the past three years.  Yes, I’m the thief, and  your suspicions were true, but I’m not an evil person.  I only steal to  survive; I make sure never to harm anyone, unless they’ve got it  coming.  All those excuses I threw around were about me:  I wrecked my  boat and stored everything in that cavern, but a landslide blocked  everything off.  One of my contacts informed me that the famous  ‘Dauntless’, captained by the legendary Dr. Miracle, was making port on  this humble little world, and so I did everything I could to gain your  trust—just so I could take all the treasures I had amassed and leave  the world a little richer than when I came.  It’s quite all right if  you feel betrayed, and if you want revenge, I won’t stop you—nor will I  resent you.  I may have lied to you time and again, but one thing is  certain:  I <u>was</u> attracted to you and I <u>have</u> fallen for  you.  I hope we’ll meet again soon, beautiful Eve, even if we are on  opposite sides.  Until then, I’ll be dreaming of you.</em></p>
<p><em>“With sincerest wishes and fondest farewells, ‘Nanette’—also known as ‘The Jackal’.”</em></p>
<p>            “We’ve got competition,” Eve muttered.  Her only two friends in the world nodded.</p>
<p>            “But I don’t think she’s bad.  She really looked like she was sweet on you.”</p>
<p>             “Yeah,” she sighed, crumbling the note up.  “Just my luck.  I always  get the psychos, don’t I?  Doctor, when can the ship leave?”</p>
<p>            “As soon as you’re feeling better.”</p>
<p>             “Then start the engines,” she grunted, hauling herself out.  Of course,  Eve didn’t realize she was wearing a hospital gown, but that didn’t  stop her at all.  Herut sighed as she made a “revealing” exit.</p>
<p>            “Maybe she and Chandra <em>would</em> go together.”</p>
