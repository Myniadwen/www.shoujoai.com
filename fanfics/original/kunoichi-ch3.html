~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shinrin Jinja

In its normally grim way; the Room of Fates remained dark. 
Illuminated only by the one hundred torches that had been 
scattered around the walls of the hall. And inside the room this 
time was the Honshu Koga himself; Mizuryu Hirotsugu. He sat upon 
on no great seat of power; no mighty chair to symbolize the 
influence he and his Mizuryu ninja clan had over the island of 
Honshu. He simply sat, cross-legged, upon the polished 
floorboards of the Room of Fates. Before him was a large scroll 
that had been rolled up to about a metre&#39;s length ahead of him. 
On one side of him was a small clay jar. Filled to the opening 
with black ink. Between his fingertips was a thin brush. The 
bristles dabbed with the ebony black ink of the jar. The Honshu 
Koga dipped this small brush into the black ink and withdrew it. 
Then began writing in Kanji upon the unrolled scroll. Writing 
such scrolls was less a pastime as it was a habit. Nothing more. 
But the information that those scrolls contained...

Hirotsugu stopped his actions when he heard that mighty iron and 
wood door creak open from fifty metres behind him. It was a very 
large room. But such noise could be heard easily in the 
quietness that overtook the Room of Fates. Hirotsugu gently 
placed his paint brush down and looked forwards; knowing full 
well who this was. 

&quot;Yagami-kun,&quot; His aged lips uttered, &quot;What are you doing here? I 
thought I told you to keep your eyes on our dear friend, 
Fujiwara-san...?&quot;

Yagami nodded, standing in place. &quot;I know, sir. But I thought it 
best to inform you of the news in regards to the kunoichi from 
Morioka.&quot;

Hirotsugu became a little more focused on this. &quot;...And what was 
the outcome?&quot;

&quot;Zanmaru-san failed,&quot; The young Shinobu replied, &quot;He went to 
Kimagure Gakuen and fought the girl but she was too much for 
him. He was defeated. So Setsuki-san had what was left of him... 
disposed of.&quot;

The Honshu Koga closed those powerful and wise eyes of his. 
&quot;...So Zanmaru-kun has failed his mission. How utterly 
predictable. Nevermind. He was weak and expendable in any case. 
You are ten times more powerful than he is, Yagami-kun. And a 
hundred times more talented. The girl might have alluded us in 
this case; but the other Orochi are entirely different. Have 
Ryoko-kun deal with the rebel. And this time make sure she has 
some lower-class ninja alongside her. If this girl of Morioka 
honestly wishes to deal with the power of the of the Mizuryu 
Clan and that of the Six Orochi... then she must learn what that 
means.&quot;

Yagami nodded to his master. &quot;Yes, Lord. I will inform Ryoko-san 
of your commands and then return to the Diet Building to observe 
the Souri-Daijin (Prime Minister).&quot;

After Yagami bowed for respect, his body zipped backwards and 
teleported straight out of the Shinrin Jinja with the speed of a 
demon. Yagami was truly a ninja like no other. But that was not 
Hirotsugu&#39;s worry at the moment. He knew of the power of the Six 
Orochi. He had absolutely nothing to fear from a renegade 
kunoichi. What could one woman do on her own?

&quot;...Yui-chan...&quot; Hirotsugu spoke softly, &quot;...You are a fool. You 
should know that to take a stand against a Koga is to write away 
your own life. But are you capable of surviving the Orochi...? 
Are you really worthy... to step into the next era of Japanese 
History?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kimagure Gakuen

&quot;Darn it. That was the bell. Okay then class, I think that was 
about it for now. Remember to keep your notes for our next 
lesson... and I expect to see an improvement in your lacking 
attentions spans.&quot;

After the defeat of the Lightning Shinobi, Zanmaru, things went 
well for Yui. The rest of the day went by without fuss or 
hassle. As soon as she reverted from the vicious Shiki back to 
her own normal persona; Yui caught up with Haruko and resumed 
the tour of Kimagure Gakuen. It was even larger than it looked 
from the outside. But once that had been taken care of it was 
time for the second period class. Which was Japanese History. A 
staple lesson for any Japanese school; Tokyo or not. And it went 
by without a hitch. Thankfully; Haruko was there to help her out 
with any kind of problems she might have faced. Though Haruko 
might have come off to others as a kind of busybody; that 
penchant suited her class representative role well. It was 
clearly a post that she was comfortable in. But soon enough; the 
bell went for the next period. It was a lunch break. There were 
usually three periods before lunch breaks but since this day 
ended early; one lesson period was skipped. That meant straight 
to lunch. 

Yui heaved a sigh and shuffled her History book back inside her 
school bag. She did this just while everyone else was packing up 
and leaving alongside her. She was so thankful that the people 
at the school were so accommodating. You tended to hear horror 
stories about what happened in Tokyo High Schools up in the 
north of Honshu. It was one of the reasons why Yui was both so 
nervous and excited at the prospect of coming here. Just as Yui 
closed her book bag and shifted up from her wooden desk; Haruko 
ambled over from her own respective desk with a bright smile. 

&quot;So then, how was your first class?&quot; She asked curiously.  

Yui nodded to her. &quot;It was great. I didn&#39;t think that the other 
students here would be so...&quot;

&quot;On top of the game?&quot; Haruko offered, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s us. It&#39;s no 
secret that this school is rated one of the best in Tokyo. It&#39;s 
why I wanted to come here in the first place. Graduating from a 
good school means a better shot at getting into a good college. 
But it&#39;s going to be tough; I know.&quot;

Yui tilted her head to the side, a wondering expression on her 
face. &quot;Why is getting into a good college so important to you, 
Haruko-san?&quot;

Now that was something that Yui could see held a great weight in 
Haruko&#39;s mindset. The blonde eased back a little and took a 
distant glance, past Yui through to the glass window they were 
standing near. 

And Haruko gave one word in reply. &quot;Politics.&quot;

&quot;...Politics?&quot; Yui gave a face of hidden but ample concern. In 
spite of everything, she knew the real situation behind the 
political affairs of Japan. Parliament was virtually powerless 
in the face of the Four Koga. &quot;Why would you... want to get 
involved in something like that?&quot; 

Haruko gave Yui a focused eye. &quot;There aren&#39;t enough women 
involved in the political life of this country. I know it might 
sound like a boring ambition to you; but I really want to stand 
up for women like myself. Women who want more of a say in how 
Japan is run. Can you understand that, Yui-san?&quot;

She could. Maybe more so than Haruko actually realized. But Yui 
didn&#39;t let any of that on. &quot;Um... sure, Haruko-san.&quot;

To that, the class rep just looked away. With a rather superior 
grimace on her face. That air of ambition she once had faded for 
her &#39;busybody&#39; mode. &quot;Oh sure. You know, you&#39;re just like 
everyone else here, Yui-san. You guys are so concerned with what 
happens now that you ignore what happens in the future. All you 
guys think about is who you want to date or when the next 
Gentatsu Boys mini-CD is coming out&quot;

Yui nervously ran a hand through the back of her thick chocolate 
hair. She actually hated the Gentatsu Boys. &quot;Well... we are just 
High School students after all, Haruko-san.&quot;

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Haruko shrugged, then gripped Yui by the wrist, 
&quot;But whatever. It&#39;s lunch break now so we better get going. I 
eat with my Brother everyday so we can&#39;t be late.&quot;

And Yui soon began to realize that lateness was something that 
Haruko was not a fan of. The two girls made their way out of 
their classroom and dashed around to the lunchroom. By which 
time it was packed. It seemed that different year groups entered 
the lunchroom at different times. Some stayed in there to eat; 
some went out to the grass fields and ate there. It was Haruko&#39;s 
choice to do the same. But first they had to get something. 
While the class rep and her &#39;charge for the day&#39; lined up to get 
lunch; Yui couldn&#39;t help but cast her mind back to the short 
conversation she had with Haruko back in the Japanese History 
room. 

Haruko really wasn&#39;t like most girls you met in modern Tokyo. 
Most young girls here were frivolous and un-focused. School 
itself was just an annoyance to them, no matter how much work 
they were forced to put in due to the influence of their 
parents. But it was different for Haruko. She had serious goals 
in life. Ones she had made for herself, not just offshoots of 
her parent&#39;s will. They might have been beyond her in years; but 
they were honest and noble aspirations. Which was one of the 
reasons that Yui liked her so much. They had only known each 
other for a few hours; but she valued the small friendship that 
had sparked between them. Haruko didn&#39;t seem the type to reveal 
her future goals to just anyone. Which made Yui appreciative of 
what she had been told. Far more than she let on. It was one of 
those rare times in her life that Hazumaru Yui felt liberated 
from the dark shadow of Shiki. 

It only took ten minutes for that lunch line to die down enough 
for Yui and Haruko to get something. Which they did. Both girls 
picked up a tray and were served by one of the large lunch 
ladies/men who worked behind the counter. It wasn&#39;t a usual 
practice for Yui to take lunch like this. But Japanese society 
had undergone a process of deep westernisation for the past 
eight years. In this year of 2023, life in major Japanese cities 
was very similar to life in the west. Once Yui and Haruko had 
loaded up their trays; the girls left the lunch lines and took a 
detour through one of the side doors out of the lunchroom; 
ignoring all the loud banter of the others students as they 
chattered and ate. Haruko led Yui around the cafeteria to a 
grassy area that was located right behind it. It was close to 
the gates that blocked off the school from the outside; so the 
two girls got a good view of all the parks, roads and houses 
that were dotted around the precinct of the school.

&quot;C&#39;mon, Yui-san,&quot; Haruko prodded, sitting cross-legged on the 
grass,  &quot;Take a seat.&quot;

&quot;Okay...&quot; 

Yui timidly followed suit. Back in Morioka, Yui and her friends 
really weren&#39;t allowed to eat outside of the lunchroom. 
Something about not spreading unnecessary litter about the 
place. That was not the case with Kimagure Gakuen, it seemed. 
The young woman placed her tray down evenly and soaked up the 
climate. It was nice day today. The sun was shining, there were 
no clouds in the sky to block it out; and there was a nice 
breeze to follow it along. Aside from the battle with Zanmaru 
and the appearance of Setsuki; it was a good day.

Haruko dabbed her chopsticks into the bowl of Wantan-men that 
had been place on her tray. She took a sample and ate; her eyes 
looking around her. &quot;Where, oh where is that brother of mine? He 
should be here by now. This is our usual spot.&quot;

&quot;I was thinking...&quot; Yui pressed her palms into her lap as she 
sat, &quot;Do you think that your brother will mind that I&#39;m here? I 
don&#39;t want to intrude or anything.&quot;

Haruko waved that comment off. &quot;Don&#39;t be silly. Onii-san will 
love you. Which is likely because almost all the girls in this 
school seem to love him as well. He&#39;s a senior so he&#39;ll be 
leaving next year; but the women in this school can&#39;t seem to 
get enough of him. I&#39;ll never understand why though.&quot;

A male voice spoke back. &quot;...So. Is this the kind of thing you 
say about me to newcomers?&quot;

Haruko&#39;s eyes brightened all in one instant. Then lowered in 
irritation. &quot;...Do you realize that you&#39;re late? You know how 
much I hate it when someone is late.&quot;

The seated Yui looked up with Haruko at the taller, older boy. 
No wonder they were brother and sister. They looked exactly 
alike. Aside from his hair (which was more of a silvery-blonde 
tone as opposed to Haruko&#39;s platinum blonde) they could almost 
pass for twins. The older man absently ran a hand through his 
silvery bangs and took a seat on the grass just a little ways 
ahead of Haruko and Yui, facing them.

&quot;Haruko-chan,&quot; He spoke, slowly, &quot;You&#39;ve got a hang up when it 
comes to punctuality. Let it go. I have a huge art project due 
in on Friday and I&#39;ve barely gotten started. Plus, Okaa-san and 
Otou-san keep asking me to visit Oji-san over in Roppongi. And I 
think we both know who&#39;s turn it is this month.&quot; 

Haruko scowled at him playfully, then looked over at Yui. 
&quot;...Well, this wonderful image of manhood is my Brother. Uchida 
Hibuki. Hibuki-kun, this is my new friend, Hazumaru Yui.&quot;

Something of an alertness passed through Hibuki&#39;s eyes in the 
instant that he heard the name &#39;Hazumaru&#39;. But this went 
un-noticed to Yui. The older boy held out a hand. Yui nodded to 
him and shook hands. But the moment that Yui shook hands with 
him; she froze. She looked up into his clear blue eyes and 
probed. She could actually feel... a strong aura from this boy. 
And Yui wasn&#39;t the type to make mistakes about this sort of 
thing. But before she read too much into that, she released his 
hand and nodded once more.

&quot;... It&#39;s nice to meet you, Hibuki-san,&quot; Yui said timorously, 
&quot;...I hope we can be friends.&quot;

Hibuki nodded to her, in reply. &quot;Of course. Any friend of 
Haruko-chan is a friend of mine. No matter how high maintenance 
she is.&quot; 

Again, Haruko scowled at her brother. &quot;What did you just call 
me? You know, you wouldn&#39;t have a problem with Art Projects and 
keeping to times if you weren&#39;t so flashy and vacant. You know 
what your problem is, don&#39;t you?  You have no real 
responsibilities, Hibuki-kun.&quot;

The older youth pointed at Haruko and looked over at Yui. &quot;Do 
you see what I have to deal with?&quot; 

Yui giggled cheerfully while she watched Haruko and Hibuki go at 
each other. You could tell they cared a lot about each other. 
They were so hung up on the other&#39;s failings that it was pretty 
obvious. It made Yui wish that she had some siblings of her own. 
For now she blocked out all thoughts of schoolwork and her... 
other work; and just enjoyed being around two of her newest 
friends. Life in Tokyo didn&#39;t seem half as threatening as 
before. Of course; if she had any idea of the plans going on 
around and about her; she wouldn&#39;t nearly have been as relaxed 
as she felt right then. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kimagure Gakuen

But not like it was before. Darkness had overtaken the school. 
It was night. Around 8.00 at night, to be frank. All students 
had left the school. Those who remained where simply the 
janitors that cleaned up after the messes left by the pupils. 
But far from the burly men and women who cleaned up that mess; 
new forces were gathering. Atop of the Humanities Department of 
Kimagure Gakuen. A lone ninja stood atop the roof of the 
building. Dressed in electric pink ninja gear and with a thick 
leather belt around the waist; armed to the teeth with Kunai 
knives. The woman kneeled down to the stone of the ground, and 
placed her hand over it. As if to probe for something.

&quot;Hmm...&quot; She mused upon her thoughts, &quot;...Zanmaru-san was 
definitely killed here. That idiot. He probably got so caught up 
in the thrill of fighting this rogue kunoichi that he let his 
guard down. Oh well... Hirotsugu-sama wishes me to take care of 
this little matter myself. So it shall be done.&quot;

The young kunoichi stood upright from the crouched position she 
once was in. With her gloved right hand she made the two 
fingered sign of the shinobi; and slipped her eyes shut. The 
free hand began a series of katas; while the girl mumbled to 
herself in an ancient Japanese tongue. Then came the reaction. 
There was an illumination in the ground beneath her. It was a 
golden light that took on the form of a puddle. The bright gold 
illumination was the spiritual representation of Zanmaru&#39;s 
bloodstains. Someone had washed away the blood; but that didn&#39;t 
matter to this particular ninja. After all; one main essence of 
her Ninjutsu style was tracking. The spiritual bloodstains 
trailed off the roof of the humanities department and went 
downwards. Perfect.

The girl opened her eyes and smiled from behind her protective 
pink mouthpiece. &quot;Brilliant. It looks like this will be easier 
than I first thought. Foot soldiers!&quot; 

As soon as the girl called on them, they were ready. Five 
shadowy shinobi vaulted inwards from a midair teleportation; and 
landed around the Pink Kunoichi. They bowed to her with respect, 
their chests bearing the Kanji symbols for Water Dragon, 
&#39;Mizuryuu&#39;. These were lesser shinobi of the Mizuryu Clan; the 
ninja clan that followed under the coat tales of the Honshu 
Koga; Hirotsugu. They all bowed their heads to the kunoichi in 
electric pink, knowing full well who she was. The First Orochi.

She looked down at the poised ninja. &quot;Good. You&#39;ve all come 
quickly. Now. The spell I cast will allow you to find the girl! 
Follow that trail and eliminate her! Hirotsugu-sama will expect 
nothing less from us!&quot;

They all nodded to her, yelling; &#39;yes ma&#39;am!&#39;. Then jumped into 
the air and teleported away. To follow that trail of Zanmaru&#39;s 
blood. This was a technique designed by the Pink Kunoichi to 
track the killer of a person. It would lead them straight to 
this rebel without fail. While she took time to think of this; 
another Orochi made an appearance. There was a figure standing 
on the small box-way room that lead into the main building. 
Yagami. 

The ruthlessly powerful ninja looked down on the younger girl 
with a disapproving glare on his face. To say that he had doubts 
was an understatement. &quot;This is foolish. You should know that 
those minor ninja will not stand the slightest chance against 
this woman that our Lord wishes dead. Only the Orochi are 
capable of killing her.&quot; 

&quot;I know that,&quot; The Pink Kunoichi retorted, &quot;Those men will 
merely soften her for me. I can handle this whole thing myself. 
With my mastery of Gensou-jutsu (Art of Illusion) no mere girl 
stands a chance against me.&quot;

Yagami crossed those his muscular arms of his. &quot;Do not 
underestimate her. Hirotsugu-sama would not bother with such a 
woman unless he had good reason to.&quot;

The Pink Kunoichi smiled at her superior. &quot;I say you worry too 
much, Yagami-sama. I will deal with this and make our Lord 
proud. Nothing must stand in the way of his plans.&quot;

The woman then ran forwards and jumped into the air. Her form 
zipped into the air as a blur, and she vanished. To follow her 
troops as they hunted down the girl who defeated Zanmaru. Yagami 
simply watched the quiet flow of the wind and remained silent. 
The Pink Kunoichi had such a passion for the hunt. In the same 
way that Zanmaru had passions for killling. It was her mark of 
distinction. But could she win? That would be for fate to 
decide. She had more than enough power to impress the likes of 
Yagami. And she did have an impressive hit list of successful 
kills. 

She was called &#39;Ryoko&#39;, the Imageless Kunoichi.
