~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Following Day, Field 01, West Jungle, Kakuri Isle 

&#147;You have both been debriefed about the rules of this tournament. When 
the winner is decided, they will take their owned crystal and earned 
crystal to the next field where you will fight your next opponent. 
Though you will not be monitored in person, you *will* be monitored by 
security camera. Anyone seen to be breaking any of the tournament&#146;s 
rules will be immediately disqualified. Do you both understand?&#148;

Yoko just nodded along with the opponent across from her. It was a 
beautiful day to fight There wasn&#146;t a cloud in the sky, there was a 
cooling breeze from the east, and Kakuri Isle itself was a serene and 
gorgeous place. The thick rows of tropical trees surrounding the stone 
arena showed that off. Field 01 was a simple field, 50-by-50 metres of 
soft stone paved into the ground and grass. There were 16 other fields 
just like this one, surrounding the inner arenas like an outer ring. Out 
there somewhere were Jun and Xiangau. Even Li Ming.

Yoko shook her head. There was no time to think about Li Ming. She made 
her choice. If she wanted to push away the people who cared about her 
for some stupid secret, then Yoko would just let her do it. For now, she 
had to focus on the task at hand. Defeating her first opponent. 

Yoko looked across at him. This man, apparently called &#145;Senmaru&#146; was of 
Japanese decent. A pretty good fighter who had won a regional 
championship or two in his past. He was tall, looked about 26 -7 years 
of age, had dark hair, and was stubbly around the chin. Dressed in a 
navy blue Gi, he was definitely a fighter of Traditional Fighting 
Karate. For the most part, he didn&#146;t pose much of a challenge for Yoko. 
But she had to keep up her guard. 

The Asagawa-girl was dressed up the full-fledged Asagawa-style dress 
code that had been taught to her by her adoptive grandfather. A pure 
white Gi, with black lining around the tips and edges, her hands and 
feet taped, and a white headband around her head, one with the symbol of 
her family, the Black Sun. Her hair was tied up into a long ponytail 
that flicked around at the small of her back. The girl drew up her hands 
One against her side, the other near her chin, body slightly tilted. 
Senmaru bowed for respect, then brought up his guard. The tournament 
coordinator at the edge of the ring spoke once more.

&#147;The first round of the God of Fighting Grand Championships begins!&#148;

Yoko and Senmaru narrowed down on each other. Both remained still at 
first, then slowly inched closer to each other, step by tiny step. The 
gap that was between them began to decrease after time, until Yoko and 
Senmaru were within striking range of each other. 

&#147;Yah!&#148;

Yoko was the first to attack. She launched a kick straight for the head 
of Senmaru. Senmaru leaned to the side and blocked the quick strike, 
shuffling his feet to the left He crouched down as soon as Yoko 
retracted her leg, then swung his body around Yoko blinked as Senmaru&#146;s 
leg whipped around the stone floor She hopped up, avoiding the sweep, 
her feet springing off the ground. She landed just a metre away, then 
brought her guard back up. Senmaru span his body all the way around, 
then stood. He charged Yoko, and punched at Yoko. Yoko&#146;s head jerked 
back as her jaw was hit by Senmaru&#146;s punch He followed it up with a 
second blow, via the left fist. Yoko leaned back again as she was hit by 
a second. Senmaru cried out as he gave a kick, this time at the waist, 
that made Yoko bend forward from the waist. Senmaru withdrew his leg 
from Yoko&#146;s gut, swung his leg up and around, then brought it down, heel 
first, into the back of a bent-over Yoko. 

Senmaru drew back his leg, stepped away from Yoko, and caught his 
breath. His so-called &#145;Two-Four Piston Combo&#146; took a bit of breath away 
from him. But he assumed that Yoko would be downed for good with that 
one. So when he saw Yoko move, he was shocked beyond believe. Yoko drew 
up her hands, ambled up by the knees, till she was standing firm and 
proud, a cute smile on her face 

&#147;Hey!&#148; She said happily. &#147;That wasn&#146;t half bad!&#148;

Senmaru tightened his fist. &#147;H-How&#133; did you maintain&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Maintain what?&#148;

The older man shook his head. It didn&#146;t matter, he had to proceed with 
the tournament. Senmaru yelled a battle cry, then came at Yoko. He 
attempted a swift punch, the young girl swung her upper body to the side 
to avoid it. Senmaru punched at her again with the right hand, Yoko 
leaned back so far that the fist travelled over her. Yoko kneeled down, 
pressing both of her hands into the ground, then swung a violent 
sweeping kick in a similar way to Senmaru&#146;s previous one.  This, he did 
not avoid. Senmaru gasped as Yoko&#146;s taped foot slammed into his ankles. 
He was struck off of his feet, and right into Yoko&#146;s hands. In a split 
second motion, Yoko pulled her leg back in, then shot her palm up into 
Senmaru&#146;s stomach with one swift blow.  

Senmaru winced and gasped. Yoko leisurely pulled her hand away from 
Senmaru&#146;s gut and stood upright. The older man slowly stood up, not even 
checking to see if Yoko was about to attack him. He looked over at her. 

&#145;She&#146;s far stronger than I expected.&#146; He thought. &#145;I was careless&#133;&#146;

Shortly after that, he passed out. Yoko giggled with delight, knowing 
that she had won her first round. Over by one of the tropical trees 
outside of the ring, was an a sort of intercom stereo. It boomed out a 
computerized voice to tell the details of the match

&#147;Winner&#133; Yoko Asagawa.&#148; It said soullessly. 

Yoko couldn&#146;t stop smiling. &#147;Alright! I won! Hmm&#133; I guess I have to take 
his crystal now.&#148;

There was a pouch at Senmaru&#146;s waist. All fighters had that pouch. It 
served as a container for the eight crystals needed to enter the quarter 
finals Yoko bent over, thrust her hand into his pouch and withdrew the 
crystal that was there. She put it into her own pouch, then walked off 
to the edge of the arena and stepped off. There was a dirt path that led 
deeper into the island. That was the direction the next ring was at. 
Yoko followed it. 

While walking down that path, she thought, &#145;I wonder how Jun is doing?&#146; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Field 09, Central Jungle, Kakuri Isle

&#147;Huh! Huh! Hah!&#148;

Jun swung and dodged each of this man&#146;s punches like they were 
absolutely nothing. Back and forth, back and forth, Jun&#146;s form swayed 
from one side to the other with polished speed. The man that was 
striking at her (or at least trying to) stopped when he needed to catch 
his breath. He leaped back, out of harm&#146;s reach, and proceeded to gather 
himself and his thoughts. 

Jun didn&#146;t even bother to chase after him. She waited and watched as 
this man got his breath back. It was at that point that she took to time 
to properly assess him. This man, a full head taller than Jun, was 
probably American. He was black, dressed in silver and red shorts, 
silver sports shoes and wore a pair of red and silver boxing gloves. A 
boxer. The Mohawk on his head made him more noticeable, though. Jun 
herself was wearing something far less formal that fighting kit. She was 
in a tight ashen shirt (tight enough to show off her &#146;womanly assets&#146; to 
the world), which was below a small jeans jackets On her legs were a 
pair of equally tight (without being restrictive) blue jeans, made in 
Italy. Her feet were knocked up with &#145;flashy&#146; brown moccasins. She 
didn&#146;t even bother to wear any gloves. The way she saw it, these were 
just preliminaries. A way of wheedling out the crap before the real 
fight got started. All she had to do was eliminate this man, and she 
could proceed. Jun looked over at the man she was fighting. His name 
under entry was &#145;Sean Riot&#146;. Though she hadn&#146;t heard of him, some people 
on the Grand Soma had recognized him. That probably meant something. 

Sean got his momentum back. And was not refocused. He looked back at 
Jun, who was giving him those overconfident glares of hers. 

&#145;Damn kid!&#146; Sean thought to himself. &#145;How&#146;s a cut-off little half-pint 
like her so strong? And how the heck did she dodge all my punches? Guess 
I&#146;m gonna have to take this up a notch&#133;&#146;

Sean stamped his booted feet into the ground. If he was going to 
proceed, he&#146;d need something that could tip the scales. His trump card. 
Jun remained relaxed, till she felt Sean gathering energy into himself. 
That was unusual. Most American/Western fighters used their 
overabundance of strength to win matches. This Sean Riot character on 
the other hand, he seemed to know how to manipulate Chi. Sean&#146;s eyes 
flashed with readiness, and he ran forwards at a now alert Jun. Sean 
branched out his arm, fully extending it, and screamed with battle 
passion.

&#147;Haaaah!&#148; He hollered loudly. &#147;Corkscrew Flame Knuckle!&#148;

The air around Sean&#146;s fist ignited, and Chi-powered flames surrounded 
his powerful punching technique. Jun dove to one side, avoiding Sean&#146;s 
fiery fist, then lunged back in, her knee projected. Sean gave a grunt 
of pain when Jun&#146;s rock hard knee attack pounded his ribs. His feet 
stumbled to the side, till he tripped up onto the stone of the arena. 
Jun watched for his next move. None came. But she never expected a boxer 
to use &#145;Chi-infusion&#146;. To think, that a westerner could use Chi to power 
up the force of their blows. Of course, this man had to be a beginner if 
that was the best he could do. 

Sean breathed a sigh, looking downwards. Jun was superior to him. &#147;I&#133; 
surrender.&#148;

Jun smiled &#147;Heh, heh, heh! Not to worry, you&#146;re the sharpest boxer I&#146;ve 
seen in a while. Now if you&#146;ll hand me that crystal of yours, I&#146;ll be on 
my way.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Centre Field 02, Outer West Jungle

Yoko stepped up to the second stage of the road to the quarter finals. 
Just winning this fight would bring her into the quarter finals of this 
tournament. When she got to the top of the steps, she looked over the 
distance of the stone arena (exactly the same as the one before) her 
opponent had already gotten here. That was a concern Considering how 
fast she beat Senmaru, she was expecting to have to *wait* for her next 
challenge to arrive. 

She took a brief gander at him. This man was quiet. From the tone of his 
skin, he looked like he originated from the Philippines. He was of 
medium height, just a little bit taller than Yoko herself, and was 
dressed in Muey Thai clothing (shorts, taped hands and fists). Yoko knew 
nothing about him. But that didn&#146;t matter much. All she had to be aware 
of was proceeding to the next stage. Yoko walked slowly towards the Muey 
Thai fighter. His eyes remained closed, till Yoko got close enough. They 
flashed open, to reveal strong determination to win. 

&#147;You&#146;re Yoko Asagawa, are you not?&#148; He asked. 

Yoko nodded &#147;Who is asking?&#148;

&#147;My name is Bon Fau.&#148; He said silently. &#147;Before we fight, I must ask 
you. Will you submit, and let me pass?&#148; 

&#147;Excuse me?&#148; The girl questioned.

Bon Fau shook his head. &#147;I am not trying to trick you. I have entered 
this tournament for one reason and one reason only. I come from Paoji 
village. A very poor section of the world. I entered the tournament in 
the hopes of winning the prize money needed to help my family through 
the hard times they are facing. Please let me help them. Let me through 
without violence.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry to hear that.&#148; Yoko responded. &#147;I hate to hear of people&#146;s 
suffering. But I entered this fight to test my limits to their maximum. 
And I have a deeper need. To meet with someone I haven&#146;t seen in a 
while&#133; and give her the chance to explain herself. For that reason, I 
cannot submit to you.&#148;

Bon Fau sighed &#147;I see. Well, I respect your dedication. We will settle 
this with our fists!&#148;

In that instant, he charged. Yoko watched his motions as Bon Fau flung 
himself at her, in a quick tackle. She swerved to one side, avoiding his 
charge, but didn&#146;t move any further than that. Bon Fau swung the back of 
fist around his body, sharply, fiercely, and blindly. Yoko ducked under 
it speedily, and ducked away as a second punch came for her from above. 
It smashed into the ground, cracking the paved floor of stone. Yoko back 
peddled and watched the furious Bon Fau charge he once more She 
sidestepped him like a matador, avoiding the raging bull, and moved 
around to get a better position to strike. 

Suddenly she realized just why Bon Fau had gotten here so quickly. He 
was a carnivorous fighter, his will to save his family was unparallel. 
But, his recklessness was working against him. That desperation wasn&#146;t 
allowing him to think clearly As much as she hated to do this, she had 
to show him that rage would get him no where. 

Yoko stood still, spreading her legs. She pulled her arm up above her 
head, and pushed her hand downwards, spreading the palm. Bon Fau did not 
even bother to think about what Yoko might be planning, and instead went 
for another charging stride. Bon Fau jumped off the ground, extended his 
leg and drew the other one close, screaming with passion, fire and the 
will to win. 

The altercation happened in seconds. Yoko brought up both of her arms to 
cover her face from Bon Fau&#146;s flying kick. With the kick successfully 
blocked, she grabbed his leg by both hands. From the speed of the kick, 
it was easy to perform a throw. It took little for Bon Fau to realize 
that his momentum had worked against him. Yoko&#146;s arms and upper body 
weight hurled Bon Fau over and away. He landed sharply, the ground 
grazing his legs and shoulder. But what was worse was that he had landed 
outside of the ring. And it also occurred to him that it was his own 
fault. If he hadn&#146;t pushed Yoko so close to the edge of the ring, he 
wouldn&#146;t have been thrown out. And we wouldn&#146;t of lost his chance to 
save his family. 

The intercom gave off the outcome. &#147;Winner&#133; Yoko Asagawa&#148;

Bon Fau punched the ground in his anguish. &#147;I am defeated&#133;&#148; 

Though her special reversal technique, &#145;Crystal Goddess&#146;  had won her 
the fight, she didn&#146;t feel too happy about her victory. Yoko sighed, and 
walked to the edge of the ring. She leaned over it, and did her best to 
smile for Bon Fau. &#147;If I win this&#133; I&#146;ll give you my prize money.&#148;

Centre Field 06, Central Jungle

&#147;Oh, ho, ho, ho!&#148; Steinler laughed heartily. &#147;So you made it this far, 
my Japanese princess?&#148;

Jun smiled back at Steinler. Truly she didn&#146;t expect to meet with this 
guy at this point. She actually expected him to be knocked out by one of 
the other fighters long before he reached this stage. In actuality, he 
had reached this stage point before she did. Maybe he wasn&#146;t all mouth, 
like Yoko had suggested. 

Jun took on a fighting stance as she thought, &#145;Doesn&#146;t matter&#133;&#146; 

She then ran at the large western man. Jun gave an effeminate cry as she 
charged at Steinler, pulling back both of her hands against her sides. 
This man was very heavily built, Jun knew that the only way to take him 
down would be to quickly knock him out. Using her throwing techniques 
would be a worthless action against him. Jun delivered a swift punch to 
the stomach as she came close, her fists pounding the core of his gut. 
Without removing her hand from his lower torso, she looked up. She 
looked up and saw a smile. 

&#147;Heh, heh, heh!&#148; Steinler kept laughing. &#147;You&#146;ll have to do better than 
that to finish me off!&#148;

A large, thick hand came from nowhere and grabbed Jun by the throat. 
Though she was confused, she knew that it was Steinler holding her. A 
sentiment that was quickly confirmed as the Irish Wrestler hoisted her 
up from the stone floor of the arena. Jun felt her feet dangling in the 
air. Her hands tried to grab his wrist. Her two small hands struggled to 
hold on to Steinler&#146;s solid arm. But it was no use. His grip was so 
strong. Now it was no wonder that this man had gotten this far. His 
speed might have been lacking, but Steinler made up for that in strength 

Jun&#146;s struggles became urgent when she felt herself slipping away. She 
had committed enough knockouts via choking in her time to know that this 
was going to win Steinler the match. Jun swung her body back and forth, 
gaining some momentum in her legs, then made a final swing from the 
shoulders. Jun&#146;s legs smacked the side of Steinler&#146;s head, catching the 
older man off guard. Jun used that time to break free of the grip, then 
shot away from his calloused hand as speedily as she possibly could.

&#145;If I&#146;m to beat this guy before he uses more of that strength on me, I 
have to finish him off, right here and now!&#146;

Jun dove hand first into the ground, tumbled into a forward roll and 
avoided the swing of Steinler&#146;s long arm. She stood up, then leaped up 
so her knees pressed into his back. Her arms wound around his arms, and 
before Steinler knew it, he was locked in Jun&#146;s patented, flawless 
technique, the Stunner Grab. 

A few minutes later, the Irish Wrestler, Steinler,  was well and truly 
down for the count.

&#147;Winner&#133; Jun Magami.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

E. K. J. C (East Kakuri Jungle Checkpoint)

Yoko walked up the one of the two guards at the checkpoint. This place 
was deep in the heartland of the Kakuri Jungle. The wooden and stone 
strip of a gateway seemed to dissolve into the thickness of the 
surrounding trees. It was obviously connected to the other checkpoints 
that lead to the Quarter Final ring. Of course, she couldn&#146;t see that 
connection, but  that was just a little thing that Yoko observed One of 
the two guards addressed her as she walked up to the checkpoint for the 
Quarter Finals. 

&#147;Got your four crystals as proof of candidacy?&#148;

Yoko nodded, and went into the pouch at her waist. She withdrew her own 
crystal, along with the three she had won in victories over Senmaru and 
Bon Fau. The second of the guards rudely grunted in acceptance of that, 
then turned around and tapped a security code into the door. It opened, 
and Yoko stepped through, handing her crystals and pouch to the other 
guard. Then, she beheld the Quarter Final Arena. It was different to the 
rest, much different. The stone it was built from was lighter, and the 
blocks that made up the arena were better taken care of. The surrounding 
grass was trimmed to its lightest, and the arena itself was a little 
larger, about 75x75 metres. A very wide space for a martial arts battle. 

She walked over to the steps, and climbed them, reaching the face of the 
arena floor. And when she looked across it, Yoko was surprised to see 
that her opponent had already reached there. And she was even more 
surprised to see who her opponent was. All he wore were a pair of black 
leggings, a white belt, Chinese flat soled shoes, and some shades. On 
his toned back was the tattoo of a Chinese Dragon, the colours of blue 
and red&#133; the symbol of the martial arts master of the movie world&#133;

Yoko was shocked. &#147;R-Ryoma Taneda? *I* am going to fight Ryoma Taneda?!&#148;

The man in question called out to her. &#147;Yo, kid! Think we can hurry this 
up?&#148;

The girl hushed her way forward, barely taking her eyes of the man in 
the centre of the ring She still could not believe that she was going to 
go head-to-head with &#145;Ryoma Taneda&#146;. Aside from being a martial arts 
movie legend, he was said to have made his way up from illegal 
underground fights with the &#145;furiousness and savageness of a demon&#146;. He 
was famous, both in the east and west. Yoko was a member of his fan 
club. She had even been surfing on his official web page! But now she 
was supposed to fight him? Yoko had a hard enough time separating the 
fictional Ryoma on screen, from the real one, standing in front of her 
now. 

When Yoko got close enough, she bowed for respect. &#147;Mr. Taneda, I&#146;m so 
honoured! I-I hope that I won&#146;t embarrass myself against you&#133; I love all 
your films and everything&#133; I um&#133;&#148;

Ryoma yawned discourteously. &#147;Yeah, yeah, you&#146;re one of my greatest 
fans. Whatever. Look, lets just get this over with.&#148;

Whoa! Yoko recoiled, stunned by Ryoma&#146;s blunt rudeness. She had no idea 
he was such a jerk. Sure, it was annoying for famous people to have to 
deal with their fans, but that was part of the price paid for being in 
the public eye. There was no need to be rude about it. Now Yoko couldn&#146;t 
wait to fight this guy. The young woman clenched her fists, spread her 
legs, brought her right hand to her side, the left to her chin, body 
slightly tilted to the left. Ryoma finally wiped that smug look off his 
face then got ready. His feet began dancing back and forth in slow, 
steady rhythms, his loose hands flaying about from their raised 
positions. Yoko had never fought someone who was a master of Jeet Kune 
Do before, but there was a first time for everything. And she was having 
a hard enough time believing that she was actually going to fight *Ryoma 
Taneda*.

&#147;Whoooooo&#133;. wata!&#148;

Yoko quickly recoiled and darted back as Ryoma&#146;s fist came out of 
nowhere to strike. It happened again, an attack which Yoko managed to 
see better, and she swung left from the waist up to avoid it. A third 
came. This one was too strong to avoid. Yoko winced as she was struck 
dead-centre in the face, her head jerking back. Ryoma smiled and 
followed up with a lightning fast kick to her stomach, one that made her 
crouch over. Yoko&#146;s hair whipped up and then down as her whole upper 
body leaned downwards. 

&#147;Woooyah!&#148;

Ryoma screamed another of those passionate cries, and his elbow was the 
next to attack. Yoko gasped as the elbow strike hammered her back, 
completely wiping out her balance. She toppled over to the group, face 
first, while Ryoma drew back his arm and smiled victoriously 

Ryoma adjusted her glasses. &#147;You&#146;re out of your depth, kid.&#148;

Yoko fluttered her eyelids, looking downwards. Gingerly, she pressed 
both of her palms into the ground and pushed, making her upper body rise 
somewhat. She dragged her legs into herself, then shook her head. Yoko 
barely saw those strikes being thrown. Ryoma&#146;s speed was impeccable. And 
his attacks packed some serious punch. Yoko had always thought that the 
speed Ryoma displayed in his films was just a special effect or 
something. But he actually was that fast. No wonder he was so arrogant. 
He probably thought no one could beat him with that kind of skill 

But Yoko wasn&#146;t like most people. 

Even at an early age, Yoko showed and interest in and an aptitude for, 
martial arts. And so far, it had served her pretty well. The 
Asagawa-girl looked over at Ryoma, who was half convinced that he had 
already won the fight. When he saw that he hadn&#146;t, Ryoma was confused, 
but still mightily arrogant about himself.

&#147;Take a siesta, kid.&#148; Ryoma sneered, running a hand through his dark 
black hair. &#147;I&#146;m a professional Not a youngster out for a kiddie&#146;s game. 
Put your tail between your legs and make my life easier.&#148;

Yoko didn&#146;t take that for a warning. More like a challenge. &#147;Hiya!&#148; 

The girl flung her fist at the older guy, and Ryoma saw it coming a mile 
away. He dodged the punch and the one that was to follow. Yoko swapped 
sides of her body and balanced on one leg, thrusting the other 
outwardly. Ryoma kneeled below the kick, and hopped over the sweep that 
Yoko unleashed in response. Yoko attacked him again, throwing 
combination after combination, but all hit nothing but air. Ryoma was so 
fast that Yoko could barely keep up with him. Yoko growled, drew back 
her palm, then thrust it forward at Ryoma&#146;s chest. Ryoma grinned, 
grabbed it before it reached within inches of his chest, then spun the 
arm around, which in turn spun Yoko&#146;s body around. 

&#147;Aahh!&#148;

Yoko was slammed into the ground, below the feet of Ryoma, her assault 
ending with not even one landed blow. Dust was whipped up as she fell, 
and she coughed from it. It didn&#146;t take much for her to stand again, but 
it did take a lot to think up a strategy. What strategy could Yoko use 
against this man? He was so fast that attacking him was almost 
impossible. What&#146;s more, using that speed didn&#146;t seem to tire him out at 
all. It looked like matches would be getting far tougher from this point 
on. But if she couldn&#146;t figure out a way to defeat Ryoma, she&#146;d never 
make it to the Semi-Finals.

&#147;So you&#146;re up? You just don&#146;t know when to quit. I don&#146;t wanna hurt a 
little girl, but I think you need to be put in your place before you 
*do* get hurt.&#148;

Yoko narrowed her eyes. &#147;What&#146;s that supposed to mean?&#148;

He did not reply. Ryoma removed the dark sunglasses from his eyes, 
folded them, and slipped them into the white belt around the waist of 
his leggings. His smile became a serious expression, a sort of glare 
that spoke of victory before it had been claimed, but with a good reason 
to believe so. His stance became still, rather than flailing, but his 
body began tense with subtle shaking, as if something inside his body 
was surging to get out. He spread his legs apart, bending from the 
knees, and focused his energies. Ryoma&#146;s shaking in that position grew 
little by little, until his fists were visibly shaking. Yoko could sense 
the Chi in Ryoma&#146;s body growing with each second. But she was so drawn 
by this that she didn&#146;t realize that this was a ripe time to attack 
Ryoma parted his lips and bellowed another fierce cry.

&#147;Whoooooooaaaaaaaahhhhhhh&#133;!&#148; 

Ryoma&#146;s open palm shot out like a cannon, surrounded by surging waves of 
electrical energy drawn from his Chi. Yoko cried out, Ryoma&#146;s palm 
pounding her in the stomach, the waves of Chi passing through her body 
and shocking her flesh. The girl was hurled back by sheer force and 
speed, and her head collided brutally with the ground again, downed and 
shocked. Literally. Ryoma slowly drew in breath, his muscled chest 
heaving, streaks of electricity passing visibly up and down his body. He 
eased his position, lowering his palm and standing up straight 

Ryoma withdrew his shades and put them back on. &#147;The &#145;Rairyuuken&#146;. Not 
exactly a beginner&#146;s move Sorry I had to be so rough on you, but you 
should feel lucky, kid. I don&#146;t usually use that on amateurs.&#148;

Yoko opened her eyes gradually, realizing that she had retained 
consciousness. She was stunned Ryoma was using &#145;Chi-infusion&#146; techniques 
Physical abilities or strikes that are enhanced by powering them with 
Chi-energy usually used for wave attacks. Maybe he did have a good 
reason to be so confident But, Yoko couldn&#146;t give up like that. She 
couldn&#146;t. She wouldn&#146;t. Yoko looked back over her shoulder, at Ryoma. 
She&#146;d have respected his power more if her wasn&#146;t such an egotistical 
narcissist. 

&#145;That&#146;s it!&#146; Yoko suddenly had an idea. 

An idea which she was going to put into plan. Her eyes rolled over from 
one side of the ring to the other, and smiled when she looked at the 
south side, the one they were closest to. She got up, slowly at first, 
but she managed to stand, then turned around and faced Ryoma at a 
distance. But instead of giving him a angry look or a mean glare, she 
smiled deviously. While doing so, she clutched her left fist and began 
drawing energy into it, just as Ryoma had done. 

&#147;That all you got?&#148; She quipped. &#147;That was child&#146;s play! I barely felt a 
thing! What a pitiful little technique!&#148;

Ryoma grew annoyed. &#147;What&#146;d you say, kid?&#148;

&#147;I said that attack sucked. What&#146;s it sound like?&#148;

&#147;Oh man!&#148; Ryoma said angrily. &#147;You really picked the wrong man to mouth 
off to, kid! I tried to let you off the hook with a warning and this is 
what I get? That&#146;s it! I&#146;m not gonna take it easy on you anymore. This 
time we go for real!&#148;

Yoko just shrugged, indifferently. &#147;You mean you weren&#146;t before?&#148;

&#147;Raaah!&#148; Ryoma ran for Yoko, drawing back both fists and narrowing in. 
Yoko smiled at him, pulled up her guard, and let her feet do the work. 
Ryoma erratically flung punches at Yoko, some hit violently, some missed 
narrowly, but all were thrown with anger. Yoko continued to smile even 
when she got hit, and kept back peddling, drawing Ryoma with her, until 
he was dead centre within her trap. The energy within Yoko&#146;s fist was 
still growing Ryoma crouched down and swept at Yoko&#146;s feet, probably to 
keep her from walking back anymore. Yoko vaulted straight upwards, over 
the kick, and somersaulted forwards. The moment she landed on both feet, 
Yoko pulled back her energy charged fist. It exploded with a whoosh, and 
was surrounded by bright orange flames of Chi. The punch went straight 
for Ryoma&#146;s back, its force blasting him over the edge of the ring. Just 
where Yoko had lead him to. 

Ryoma fell to the ground, the tattooed skin of his back singed by Yoko&#146;s 
newfound attack. The younger girl smiled, her hand still burning with 
those gingery-gold flames of hers. 

&#147;The Asagawa Fist.&#148; Yoko said slowly, confidently &#147;Made it just for 
you&#133;&#148;

The action star was bamboozled. He just now realized what had happened. 
The little girl had tricked him. She enticed him into attacking by 
inciting him. Then she lead him to the edge of the arena so she could 
knock him out of it. Clever little plan for a youngster. Ryoma stood up, 
removed his glasses (one of the lenses were broken now) then turned back 
to the girl. He looked hard at her for a moment, then his hard glare 
became a defiant smile. 

&#147;Not bad, kid.&#148; He said gruffly.

Yoko smiled back innocently. &#147;Thank you, sir.&#148;

The intercom came over again, giving out the result, &#147;Winner&#133; Yoko 
Asagawa.&#148;
