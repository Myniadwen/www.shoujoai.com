<a href="../original/descent-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        The guns were warm in the redhead&#39;s hands as
she ran forward, firing them continuously and dropping
several of the security guards in bursts of blood.
Alarms wailed across the summer home, the finely kept
lawn outside littered with dead dogs and fallen men.
The front door swung open, the men who had been
guarding them laying in still warm pools of their own
blood.

        &quot;Alpha team, respond! Beta, where are you?&quot;
the head of security called, but silence was his only
answer as he flipped through the various frequencies.
&quot;It&#39;s just one woman,&quot; he growled into the radio
before ordering, &quot;somebody kill that bitch!&quot;

        &quot;Then the bitch is back,&quot; the voice purred
from right behind him then with a soft sound the whole
world went black.

        The young woman casually stepped over the dead
body, humming to herself cheerfully as she bent over
the computers of the security center. She slid an
unmarked disk in and booted it up, sending several
different viruses into the system. Then she shut all
the cameras and other security equipment down before
leaving the room.

        With unerring precision she made her way
towards the back bedroom, following along the map that
she had memorized days before. The two guards standing
by the door actually got a shot off before she dropped
them, the silenced shots giving no additional warning
to who waited inside. Quietly she opened the door, the
black business suit she was wearing making her nearly
a perfect match for the usual security goons.

        &quot;Miss, there&#39;s been shots fired,&quot; she reported
as she walked towards the bed where the woman lay,
&quot;but no indications that they&#39;ve broken in this far
into the mansion.&quot;

        &quot;Any indications on numbers?&quot; the older woman
asked, her brown hair streaked with a bit of gray. The
head of one of the largest crime families on the east
coast she was in frail health, but sadly not frail
enough for some people.

        &quot;It&#39;s just one attacker, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; she
casually pulled out her federal issue pistol once she
was close enough, all ready to fire.

        &quot;Wait,&quot; the older woman protested, &quot;I can pay
more than....&quot; The gun was nearly silent as she fired,
splattering the lady&#39;s brains up against the back
wall.

        &quot;I&#39;m not in it just for the money,&quot; she
murmured as she slid her gun away and pulled out a
digital camera, snapping off all the photos she needed
quickly. Just as fast she put the camera away and
left, calmly blending in with the confused security
staff as she slipped away from the building.

        Her earpiece chirped as she climbed into her
car out in the woods beyond the mansion, swiftly
stripping her black coat off. &quot;Aileen, how did it go?&quot;
she heard from the car phone as she unbuttoned the
white shirt to reveal her bra.

        &quot;Smooth as silk, Cathy,&quot; a smiling Aileen
answered, slipping her dress shoes off and then
tugging her pants down. &quot;That virus should help get
you into their financial records as well,&quot; she added
as Aileen bundled up all of the clothes that she had
been wearing and tossed them aside with her shoes not
too far from the older car.

        &quot;Make sure you do the guns, too,&quot; Cathy added,
&quot;this is a big job.&quot;

        With a bit of regret Aileen tossed her pistols
on top of the pile, the woman standing there nude for
a moment. She swiftly pulled on a matching set of
sweatshirt and pants even as she asked, &quot;Is there
anything on the police band?&quot;

        &quot;Nothing, as expected,&quot; Cathy answered smugly,
&quot;the old bat was wanted in ten states, they can&#39;t call
in the cops without admitting they are harboring her.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Aileen said as she fished the small
device out of her car, pulled the pin and then easily
tossed it onto the pile.

        The thermite charge burned searingly hot,
scorching the clothes to ash and searing the guns
clean of any genetic remnants. The guns themselves
could be traced by serial numbers but all they&#39;d find
was a former CIA black ops organization. The car
smoothly slipped onto the roads away from the mansion,
traveling at a moderate speed along a heavily traveled
route.

        &quot;I&#39;ve got another job lined up,&quot; Cathy&#39;s voice
came from the car&#39;s speakers.

        Aileen looked up as a helicopter whirred by
overhead, sweeping towards the mansion with grim
purpose. &#39;Wonder which of her greedy sons is running
in to take over?&#39; she wondered. &quot;That was fast,&quot; she
answered Cathy, &quot;but why would I be interested?&quot;

        &quot;You and you challenges,&quot; Cathy muttered under
her breath. &quot;Well, how about this,&quot; she continued,
&quot;the bounty is on a demon.&quot;

        &quot;Seriously?&quot; Aileen&#39;s eyes lit up slightly.
&quot;So who&#39;s putting it out?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Lady Diana, over on the east coast,&quot; Cathy
reported crisply, &quot;seems they&#39;re having some real
problems with this critter.&quot; She paused a moment
before adding, &quot;And a Knight Templar.&quot;

        &quot;My old brotherhood,&quot; Aileen&#39;s voice dropped
to a deadly purr, &quot;yes, I&#39;m very interested in this
job.&quot; Her voice became business like, &quot;Make the
arrangements, Cathy, I&#39;m going to need several
untraceable guns, holy water, and bullets from our
renegade priest.&quot;

        &quot;They&#39;ll be ready,&quot; Cathy agreed, &quot;I&#39;ve
already got a flight out ready at the airport,
passport and basic gear there to be picked up.&quot;

        &quot;Then I&#39;ll see you soon,&quot; Aileen shut the
phone down, her thoughts already occupied on planning
out the upcoming job.

        Meanwhile, halfway across the country the
crack house burned away merrily, the flames rapidly
consuming the older building as it&#39;s occupants awoke
from their beatings, gazing in shock from the lawn as
their livelihood went up in smoke.

        &quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; Sam asked, the
brown haired young woman watching intently from their
position of concealment.

        Descent shook her head, her black hair blowing
in the breeze as the demoness waited patiently. &quot;They
were selling tainted merchandise,&quot; she answered
coldly, &quot;much of which was intended to enslave the
users. I won&#39;t allow that to continue.&quot;

        Sam pulled one of her pistols, checking it
over efficiently before sliding it away. &quot;So how will
this help us find the killer?&quot; she asked coldly.

        &quot;Shaking down the small fry hasn&#39;t helped us,&quot;
Descent answered her, &quot;so we need to move up the food
chain a bit. Loosing this operation means that they&#39;re
going to have to contact a superior, and we&#39;ll be
watching.&quot;

        Sam saw a young man pull out a phone and
hissed, &quot;Here we go.&quot;

        Descent&#39;s vision was frighteningly sharp,
seeing the numbers he was pressing as if she was right
beside him. She jotted it down then passed it to Sam,
&quot;So how do we track this?&quot;

        Sam pulled her own phone out and dialed as she
said, &quot;I&#39;ll pass it on to a contact of mine, he&#39;ll be
able to find out who it belongs to.&quot;

        The two slipped away, walking through the long
abandoned building to where Sam had parked the sports
car. Once belonging to one of Diana&#39;s people they had
liberated it for their use, rationalizing that they
were using it for a better purpose.

        &quot;Isn&#39;t that illegal?&quot; Decent asked with a
little smile, sitting down in the passenger&#39;s side.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Sam said dryly from the driver&#39;s side,
&quot;so?&quot;

        &quot;Besides which,&quot; Descent actually smirked,
&quot;we&#39;re on a mission from god.&quot;

        Sam thumped her head on the steering wheel and
groaned out, &quot;You know how often I get the Blues
Brothers jokes?&quot;

        Descent just chuckled, &quot;Couldn&#39;t resist.&quot; A
bit more seriously she said, &quot;I know we&#39;re both living
outside the law, but it still bothers me
occasionally.&quot;

        &quot;Me, too,&quot; Sam admitted as they pulled out,
moving onto a side street. Her eyes narrowed
dangerously, &quot;I just try to keep in mind the sort of
things were fighting against.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Descent looked out on the
houses and buildings passing them by, the breeze
gently ruffling her hair.

        Sam&#39;s phone rang and she answered it,
listening intently as her eyes widened. &quot;Could you
repeat that?&quot; she asked, then nodded seriously. &quot;Thank
you,&quot; and she disconnected.

        &quot;What?&quot; Descent demanded as Sam sat there
silently a moment.

        &quot;The phone number is registered to a company
that handles bulk services,&quot; Sam said quietly, &quot;in
this case to the Mayor&#39;s office.&quot; She puffed out a
breath as she bitterly asked, &quot;How deep does the
corruption go in this city?&quot;

        &quot;Where ever it goes,&quot; Descent answered, &quot;we&#39;ll
follow.&quot;

        Sam nodded, &quot;You&#39;ve got that right.&quot;

        Across town in a high-rise office building an
icy looking blonde listened to the report calmly. &quot;I
want the house reopened,&quot; Lina coldly ordered,
&quot;acquire another dump in the area and resume
operations by tomorrow.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s too soon, we can&#39;t....&quot; he started.

        &quot;Do you really want to report failure in
this?&quot; Lina asked, the threat only carried in her tone
of voice. After a moment she said, &quot;I&#39;ll ensure you
have no difficulties with City Hall.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; he acknowledged and she hung up.

        Lina left her office and strode down the
hallway, opening a door at the end of the hall. The
leather clad woman looked up fearfully, then curtsied
formally as she said, &quot;Ma&#39;am.&quot;

        &quot;Madam Mayor,&quot; Lina smirked, taking in the
leather straps that bound the sexy older woman so
cruelly into her fetish uniform, the shining metal
collar that was locked around her slim neck, &quot;I have
some more work for you.&quot;</pre>
