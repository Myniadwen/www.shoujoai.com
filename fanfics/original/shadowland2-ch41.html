<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 41 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch40.html">Back to Part 40</a><pre>Jenn watched in horror as Carey plucked each of her stitches out of her 
wrist, blood starting to slowly ooze out of the opening and run down her 
arm, &quot;P... Please... stop...&quot; She pleaded with the Sister of Death. 

&quot;You are coming back with me this time.&quot; Carey explained, grinning at 
the blood, &quot;I will not allow anyone to interfere again.&quot; She pulled 
another stitch came free and she giggled as the blood squirted out, 
&quot;Father will be so proud of me. Finally I&#39;ll be able to return home.&quot; 

Kim and Jessica suddenly burst through the library doors and ran into 
the middle of the room, &quot;J... Jenn?&quot; Kim stared up at her friend and the 
strange angel above her. 

&quot;Kim!! Jessica!&quot; Jenn screamed, &quot;Run!! She is Death!!&quot; 

Carey spun around to face the intruders, &quot;How did you get in here?&quot; 
Carey hissed at the girls then glared down at Kim, &quot;Why can&#39;t you learn 
to stay away when you are told!&quot; She pulled Jenn off the ground by her 
arm and held her out before the girls, &quot;You are in time to watch your 
friend die.&quot;

&quot;Let her go!&quot; Jessica ordered.

&quot;As you wish.&quot; She giggled gleefully as her glass feathers swiftly 
slashed both of Jenn&#39;s wrists allowing the blood to flow freely, &quot;She is 
mine now.&quot; She dropped Jenn&#39;s limp body to the ground, &quot;There is no way 
you can save her.&quot;

Jessica grabbed a small chair, &quot;Get away from her!&quot; She shouted and 
tossed it at the stained glass angel.

Carey&#39;s wings ripped the chair to shreds and let the splinters fall to 
the ground, &quot;You have no power here.&quot; She boosted, &quot;This time I win.&quot; 

Kim rushed across the room to where Jenn laid, &quot;Jenn! Jenn, you can&#39;t 
die on me now.&quot; She cried while cradling the girl&#39;s head in her arms. 
She glanced at the girl&#39;s wrist in alarm as blood poured over the floor, 
soaking the carpet. 

Jenn&#39;s vision blurted as she stared up at Kim, &quot;K... K... kima....&quot; She 
said weakly. 

Jessica tore off her tank top and proceeded to tie it around Jenn&#39;s 
elbow and pulled it tight, &quot;Kim I need a piece of your dress.&quot; She 
requested as she picked up a chair leg and placed it under the makeshift 
tourniquet then twisted it to cut off the blood flow. 

Kim tore at the hem of her skirt and handed the strip to Jessica, 
&quot;Here!&quot; 

Carey sat upon the top of a shelf and watched them, &quot;Fight all you like 
she is already dead.&quot; She stated with a broad grin upon her face.

&quot;Will you shut up!!&quot; Jessica shouted at the angel, &quot;Kim hold this.&quot; She 
ordered nodding at the piece of wood, &quot;Hold it tight and do not let go.&quot; 

&quot;Alright...&quot; Kim shifted around Jenn to get a better grip on the piece 
of wood. Blood was pooling up at her knees and covering her dress, but 
she tried not to think about it and concentrated on Jenn, &quot;Oh, Jenn... 
I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She could see fear in her friend&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I... I am going to die...&quot; Jenn stammered, &quot;She... she has won...&quot;

&quot;Dammit.&quot; Kim swore, &quot;If I hadn&#39;t got lost in that dream again. If only 
I didn&#39;t let it get to me.&quot;

Jessica glared at the redhead, &quot;This is not your fault!&quot; She stated, &quot;If 
you want to blame someone then blame that insane girl up there.&quot; She 
said as held the other tourniquet tight. 

Jenn smiled up at Kim, &quot;T... tell... K.. Kris... I am... sorry...&quot; She 
lightly closed her eyes as if drifting off to sleep.

&quot;Jenn?&quot; Kim shook her friend, &quot;Jenn wake up!!&quot; Tears break free and 
rolled down her cheek, &quot;Please don&#39;t leave me like this.&quot; She sobbed 
over her dying friend, &quot;Please...&quot; 

&quot;Come on Jennifer!!!&quot; Jessica shouted, &quot;You can&#39;t die now. You are 
stronger then this.&quot;  

Carey giggled with glee as a dark swirling mass of clouds formed on the 
ceiling, &quot;Well this is my exit girls. Bid your friend farewell for you 
won&#39;t be seeing her for a long time.&quot; She stated as she flew over to the 
dark tunnel and prepared for it to open.

&quot;NO!!!&quot; Kim pulled her friend into her arms, &quot;She can&#39;t die. Not when 
I&#39;ve finally found her.&quot; 

Carey ignored the girl&#39;s cries as she glanced up into the tunnel of 
death, &quot;Finally Father allow me back into the Si-&quot; Her speech was 
abruptly cut short by something falling from the gloom tunnel and Carey 
fell to the ground hard enough to send pieces of concert floor to fly 
about the room. 

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Jessica stared at the cloud of dust that had formed 
around the angel. As the dust settled she could see Kris standing over 
Carey with her fists clenched. Brilliant glowing wings spread out behind 
Kris almost filling the entire room, &quot;Kris..?&quot; Jessica stared in awe at 
the girl and could feel her heart pounding at the sight of the girl&#39;s 
magnificent wings. 

&quot;Carey!!!&quot; Kris snarled at her sister, &quot;I-&quot; She slammed Carey&#39;s head 
into the ground, &quot;Will-&quot; Again the stained glassed angel&#39;s head 
rebounded off the concrete floor, &quot;Never - Let - You - Have - Her!!!&quot; 
Kris repeatedly smashed the girl&#39;s head into the ground with each word. 

Carey grinned up at Kris&#39;s wings, &quot;You are a sister again.&quot; She 
commented gleefully, blood tricking down from the corner of her mouth, 
&quot;Father accepted you back.&quot; She frowned when her eyes fell upon the 
pendent swinging around Kris&#39;s neck, &quot;A stone of Malith? Then you are 
not a Sister?&quot; She inquired baffled by the sight of the stone.

&quot;Why would I want to be?&quot; Kris pulled the girl to her feet by the collar 
of her hooded shirt, &quot;Milai gave me this stone so I can finally be rid 
of you.&quot; She flew at the wall and slammed her sister against it with 
enough force to burst through the brick wall and out onto the lawn. 

Jessica glanced up in disbelieve at the rage and raw power that Kris 
held, &quot;Wow...&quot; She breathed staring at the gaping hole in the wall.

&quot;She can have quiet the temper.&quot; Gwen remarked as she drifted down from 
the dark tunnel overhead. 

Kim held Jenn&#39;s body close, &quot;You can&#39;t have her!!!&quot; She exclaimed 
frantically. 

&quot;Gwen is not here for Jenn.&quot; Kai assured as she to floated into the 
library. 

Gwen simply smiled at the Kim, &quot;We have a rules in the realm of death 
too.&quot; She remarked glancing down at Jenn, &quot;A Sister of Death is not 
allowed to kill anyone. We are merely guides for those that have lost 
their way.&quot; She explained. 

&quot;But...&quot; Kim looked into Jenn&#39;s paling face, &quot;She is already dead.&quot; 

&quot;Only her body.&quot; Kai knelt beside Jenn and placed her hand upon Jenn&#39;s 
chest, &quot;Her soul is very much alive.&quot; Her palms began to glow, &quot;Come 
back, it is not your time yet.&quot; Gwen commanded, Jenn suddenly opened her 
eyes and sucked in a deep breath.

&quot;Jenn!!!&quot; Kim hugged her friend tightly, &quot;You&#39;re alive.&quot; 

Jenn glanced around in confusion, &quot;What happened?&quot; She inquired glancing 
at the two death angels standing over her, their wings taking up most of 
the room. &quot;Am I dead?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Gwen lightly placed her hand upon Jenn&#39;s wrists, &quot;I am sorry we 
were a little late. I hope you accept my apologies.&quot; 

&quot;Uhhh... I guess so...&quot; Jenn watched as the angel removed her hand and 
her wrists were healed only leaving a jagged white scar, &quot;T... thank 
you...&quot; Jenn turned her wrist before her eyes; they twitched ever so 
faintly, &quot;Why are there still scars?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

&quot;Carey may have tried to kill you this time.&quot; Gwen remarked, &quot;But you 
did try to kill yourself before.&quot; 

Jenn held her hand to her chest and glanced down in embarrassment, 
&quot;Oh...&quot;

Jessica crept over the hole in the wall and peeked up into the sky at 
the aerial battle high above, &quot;Is Kris going to be alright?&quot; She 
inquired worriedly. 

Kai hopped over to join Jessica, &quot;She tore off Carey&#39;s wings before 
which is the reason why Carey was forced to create wings of glass.&quot; She 
stated keenly, &quot;The stone brother gave her normally increases the powers 
of a Sister, only in Kris&#39;s case it granted her limited power for a 
short time. However even with limited power Kris is more then enough to 
take on Carey.&quot; 

Kris drove Carey hard into the ground creating a small crater upon the 
library lawn, &quot;How dare you toy with my life.&quot; She screamed as she 
punched the girl in the face several time, &quot;You tried to take my 
girlfriend from me.&quot; Her fist smashed into one of Carey&#39;s glass wings 
shattering it into pieces, &quot;You sent May to keep her locked within that 
nightmarish world.&quot; She crushed the other wing with her foot and ground 
the bits into the dirt, &quot;Then you torment Jenn until she is nearly 
insane.&quot; She tore the girl free of the remaining shards so they were 
face to face, &quot;Why Carey? Why?&quot; She inquired angrily.

&quot;B... but sis...&quot; Carey coughed up a bit of blood, several shards of her 
own wings had impaled her back and she clenched at one that protruded 
slightly above her hip, &quot;I thought you would be happy.&quot; She explained 
with a bloody grin, &quot;With her gone father would have accepted you back 
into the family and me as well. We would all be sisters again, is that 
not grand?&quot;

&quot;Did father tell you that?&quot; Kris demanded shaking the girl. 

&quot;No... not exactly...&quot; Carey admitted sheepishly, &quot;But Father did say he 
wanted that girl dead, didn&#39;t he?&quot; 

&quot;I do not care what he wanted. I do not want to return.&quot; Kris stated 
coldly, &quot;There is no way I would return to that place, not when I am not 
allowed to love the ones I care for.&quot; She raised her fist level with 
Carey&#39;s face, &quot;And how will killing the one I love bring me back? You 
are one sick kid and I let you off easy last time but this time I&#39;m not 
going to be so forgiving.&quot;

&quot;You can not kill me.&quot; Carey stated, her grin broadening, &quot;Sisters are 
not allowed to kill.&quot; 

&quot;I am not a Sister.&quot; Kris reminded the girl, &quot;And neither are you. I&#39;ve 
had enough of your games.&quot; Her fist began to crackle with the last of 
her energy, &quot;Good bye Carey.&quot; She swung at the girl with every ounce of 
her strength when something suddenly flew through the air and sliced 
through Kris&#39;s arm causing her to drop Carey. Kris clenched at her wound 
and searched for her assailant. 

Drake strolled across the library lawn, a sword in hand, &quot;Step away from 
Carey.&quot; He demanded, pointing his sword at Kris.

&quot;So you must be Drake?&quot; Kris snarled and started towards the man, &quot;What 
are you doing here? Why do you want my friends?&quot; 

&quot;I do not have to answer to you.&quot; Drake remarked, nodding up at Kris&#39;s 
wings. &quot;And you are in no condition to fight me so I would suggest you 
stand down.&quot; 

Kris let out a disappointed breath as her wings began to flicker and 
faded away. 

&quot;Stop right there!!&quot; Kai demanded as she flew through the air and landed 
in front of Kris. 

Drake took up a fighting stance, &quot;This is not your fight little girl.&quot; 
He stated coldly, &quot;I do not wish to hurt you. I have only come for 
Carey.&quot; 

Carey stumbled to her feet and pushed passed Kai, &quot;Dalfort!!&quot; She 
staggered towards the man, her right leg not responding to her command 
as she hobbled to him. 

&quot;Come back here!&quot; Kai rushed at the girl only to have Drake appear 
before her. Before Kai was aware the man had moved he hit her squarely 
in the chest with the hilt of his swords sending the tiny angel rolling 
across the lawn. 

&quot;Keelia!!&quot; Gwen flew to her sister&#39;s side and helped her up, &quot;You 
bastard, she is just a child!&quot; 

&quot;Do not make me laugh.&quot; Drake snorted, &quot;I know all about you angels and 
I will not hold back if you come after us.&quot;  

&quot;So he is your lap dog is he, Carey?&quot; Kris inquired coldly, &quot;What is it 
you are after Drake? Do you work for Carey or for yourself?&quot; 

Drake scooped Carey into his arms, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know?&quot; Carey 
grinned at her sister, &quot;We will be back Aigneis.&quot; She gave Kris a small 
wave as Drake turned around and walked away, &quot;See you in your dreams.&quot; 
Carey&#39;s giggles drifted through the air as the two of the vanished with 
the wind. 

&quot;I should have known.&quot; Gwen stated as she help Kai to her feet.

Kris spun around to face her sister, &quot;You should have known?&quot; She 
inquired in disbelief, &quot;Why did you not tell me about Carey before?&quot;

&quot;What would you have done if I did?&quot; Gwen inquired plainly, &quot;Come on, 
your friends are waiting for you.&quot; She started back to the library with 
Kai at her side. Kris reluctantly followed her sisters back into the 
library. 

&quot;Kris!!&quot; Jessica wrapped her arms around the girl and hugged her tight, 
&quot;I was so worried about you. Are you alright?&quot; She inquired; gingerly 
she touched Kris&#39;s wounds.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Kris remarked then gave the girl a warm embrace.  She 
glanced over Jessica&#39;s shoulder to find Kim helping Jenn to her feet. 
The girl looked weak and there was a terrified look in her eyes as she 
gazed at Kris and Jessica, &quot;Jenn are you alright?&quot; Kris inquired 
stepping around Jessica towards Jenn.  

Jenn watched the long face that spread across Jessica&#39;s face then stared 
at Kris and staggered out of reach, &quot;D... don&#39;t come near me...&quot; She 
weakly demanded, there was a deep sadness in her eyes that cut through 
Kris. Jenn&#39;s eyes kept darting between Kris and Jessica as she recalled 
the images that May had shown her.

&quot;Jenn...&quot; Kris frowned and followed the girl&#39;s gaze to Jessica and 
lightly closed her eyes, &quot;I... I am sorry...&quot; 

&quot;I know...&quot; Jenn leaned into Kim, &quot;Can we go now?&quot; She inquired, eager 
to leave that nightmare behind. 

Gwen counted the girls, &quot;Wasn&#39;t there one more? Where is the other red 
head?&quot; She inquired peculiarly. 

Kim and Jessica exchanged glances, &quot;Kima stayed with Penny.&quot; Jessica 
explained with a long face.

&quot;Penny is here too?&quot; Kris asked worriedly, &quot;Where are they?&quot; 

Jessica tapped her head, &quot;In my worst nightmares.&quot;
