<h1>Magical Sword Princess Aoi (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/aoi-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&#147;I suppose we should do some explaining then.&#148;

Aoi, Kazuki and Natsuna were all seated before this mysterious magical 
girl and the village elder. They were all in the large manor house 
belonging to the elder&#146;s family, just a short distance from Yuki-mura. 
Luckily, the fire had been put out by the combined efforts of the 
townspeople and this magic girl, but the Kagami Bandits had been the 
ones who drove off the Himitsu Rikugun. That earned them a seat at the 
elder&#146;s home, in honour of their help. While Natsuna and Kazuki 
gratefully accepted this, Aoi was rather reluctant to formalize with 
these people. All she desired was to get this mission over and done 
with. 

Natsuna crossed her legs as she watched the dark-haired magic girl 
speak. &#147;It would be nice to know what&#146;s going on here.&#148;

The magic girl nodded, and took a seat on the chair next to the elder. 
&#147;My name is... Tsubasa Tsuyoshi. You guys probably know this, but I 
can use black magic. And those guys have been chasing me for a while 
to get there hands on it, I think.&#148;

Aoi, with her arms crossed and her eyes shut, chipped in. &#147;Are you 
sure? They seemed to want you dead more than anything else.&#148;

The elder and Tsubasa stared oddly at Aoi for a few seconds, then 
Tsubasa responded. &#147;Well, yeah I guess so. I don&#146;t really know what 
they want from me. But I know for sure it&#146;s because of my magic.&#148; 

&#147;So how long have the Himitsu Rikugun been chasing you?&#148; Kazuki asked. 

Tsubasa thought about it for a second. &#147;Well... there was a incident 
before in the village and I had to use my powers to stop it from 
getting out of control. That was about three months ago. Ever since 
then, those guys have been attacking the village in pursuit of me. We 
usually fend them off, but this time their attacks were really quick 
and confusing. Somehow a fire got started, and then, well, you know 
the rest.&#148;

Natsuna nodded. &#147;I see. So, those guys are after you because you wield 
black magic. Hmm. I get the feeling that more of them will be coming 
after you, Tsubasa.&#148;

The village elder, and old man, suddenly interrupted. &#147;We were just 
overwhelmed by their sheer numbers this time. We can defend Tsubasa 
well enough in the future.&#148;

Aoi snorted. &#147;I fail to see that happening.&#148;

The village elder turned to look at Aoi. Natsuna was very respectful 
towards him and Kazuki was too, if not a little rough around the 
edges. But Aoi was completely lacking in respect for him. And the 
elder was not the only one to notice this. 

&#147;Do you doubt the abilities of Yuki-mura?&#148; The elder asked, a hint of 
anger in his voice. &#147;We will protect Tsubasa will all we have.&#148;

Aoi just looked away. &#147;With your rakes and pitchforks? Yes, great 
plan. It&#146;s obvious that the girl needs proper protection from the 
Himitsu Rikugun. They are obviously professionals at their business. A 
small village such as this will be crushed in the long run.&#148;

The village elder was once again angered by Aoi&#146;s tone and 
disposition. Tsubasa sensed this and stepped in before stronger words 
were spoken. &#147;Elder, she is right. You can&#146;t protect me here forever. 
They will keep coming back again and again until the whole village is 
destroyed.&#148;

&#147;Well...&#148; Kazuki began. &#147;That might not happen. We didn&#146;t just come 
across this village by chance, we journeyed here.&#148;

&#147;For what reason?&#148; The elder asked. 

Kazuki shifted his glance from the elder to Tsubasa. &#147;Her.&#148; He said, 
pointing to Tsubasa. &#147;Emperor Ietsuna Kagutaira of the Eastern Regions 
wants to meet with you at his imperial grounds, Kyuukyoku Castle.&#148;

Tsubasa&#146;s eyes went wide. The emperor of the entire Eastern Lands 
wanted to see her? &#147;Emperor Kagutaira? He wants to see me? Why?&#148;

&#147;We do not know.&#148; Natsuna said honestly. &#147;He really didn&#146;t say much 
about his intentions, he just wants you brought to Kyuukyoku Castle. 
Ietsuna hired us to ensure your safe passage to his fortress.&#148;

&#147;So you guys... came here to come get me?&#148; Asked Tsubasa.

Aoi spoke up again. &#147;Yes. We weren&#146;t ordered to take you by force so 
you can refuse if you wish.&#148; 

Tsubasa lowered her eyes and thought about this. In all fairness, she 
loved Yuki-mura and did not wish to leave it behind. But at the same 
time, she did not want to bring harm to the village either. Her 
presence would bring nothing but suffering to Yuki-mura if more of the 
Himitsu Rikugun came by... was this the best option?

&#147;...I don&#146;t know why...&#148; Tsubasa began, &#147;But I feel like I can trust 
you guys. If you&#146;re willing to protect me on the way there, then I&#146;ll 
go with you to Kyuukyoku Castle.&#148;

The elder looked over to Tsubasa in urgency. &#147;Are you serious, 
Tsubasa? Do you really want to leave the village?&#148;

The cheery young girl nodded. &#147;Yup. I know it seems strange right now 
to just pick up and leave, but this is the best for all of us. The 
longer I stay here, the more trouble I will bring. Maybe Ietsuna has 
some special interest in my powers and wants to talk to me about it? 
I&#146;m not sure if it&#146;s the right thing to do, but I know it&#146;s the thing 
I *want* to do.&#148;

The elder sighed. &#147;I see...&#148;

&#147;We can guarantee that you&#146;ll get there in one piece,&#148; Kazuki said 
happily. &#147;There is absolutely no need for you to worry. But, since 
we&#146;ll be travelling together for a while, we might as well introduce 
ourselves. I&#146;m Kazuki Ougano, master of Advancing Wolf-style martial 
arts and scourge of every innocent woman&#146;s heart.&#148; 

Natsuna sighed, ignoring Kazuki&#146;s dry humour. &#147;I am Natsuna Tsunagu. 
My grandfather originally formed this group that we are in. My 
speciality is healing/defence power. In some respects, you could call 
me the &#145;shield&#146; of the group.&#148;

Kazuki rolled his eyes. &#147;Oh yeah, you got that right.&#148; Then he turned 
his attention over to a cross-armed Aoi. &#147;And that cranky workaholic 
over there is Aoi Ryudouji. Master of Shingetsuken and the 99th female 
swordfighter of the Order of Hizashi.&#148;

Tsubasa smiled at Aoi. &#147;It&#146;s... it&#146;s nice to meet you.&#148;

Aoi nodded in response, not really bothering to look at her. Tsubasa&#146;s 
attention went back to Kazuki. &#147;So you guys are the Kagami Bandits?&#148;

Kazuki chuckled arrogantly. &#147;So you&#146;ve heard of us, eh?&#148;

&#147;Well of course we have.&#148; Tsubasa said. &#147;You guys have done so many 
things in the eastern lands that tales of them have reached all the 
way up north to Yuki-mura.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m glad to hear that.&#148; Kazuki said. And he was to be honest. Kazuki 
wasn&#146;t vain, but it made him happy to know that his name was getting 
around, even if it was just with farmers and remote villagers.      

Just then, Aoi stood up off her chair and walked over to the door 
without a second glance to the others. Before she left, her head 
turned slightly while saying,

&#147;Lets not waste time discussing it. I think we should leave here as 
soon as possible. More of the Himitsu Rikugun will be on their way and 
it will do us no good if we are still held up in this village. I 
suggest we leave tomorrow.&#148;

Natsuna nodded to Aoi, then looked over at Kazuki to see his choice. 
He was okay with it too. Then, Natsuna&#146;s gaze turned to Tsubasa.

&#147;Is that okay with you, Tsubasa?&#148; She asked. 

The dark-haired magic girl nodded politely. &#147;Of course. I&#146;m ready 
whenever you guys are.&#148;

&#147;Then it&#146;s agreed.&#148; With that, Aoi slipped out of the elder&#146;s house 
through the doorway. When she left, the elder scrunched his eyes at 
the remaining Kagami Bandits. This confused Kazuki, but Natsuna was 
already a step ahead of him. The elder was thrown by Aoi&#146;s rudeness 
and lack of respect.

The elder did not let this go unheeded. &#147;Why is that woman so 
discourteous? In my day, outsiders showed respect to the senior 
members of a village.&#148;

Natsuna lowered her head as an apology. &#147;I do apologize for Aoi. 
She&#146;s... had a hard life.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, poor kid.&#148; Kazuki said solemnly. &#147;Don&#146;t be too hard on her. 
She&#146;s really a sweet girl when you get to know her, but otherwise, 
Aoi&#146;s a bit of a pistol.&#148;

While Natsuna, Kazuki and the village elder continued to talk between 
themselves, Tsubasa&#146;s gaze slid over to the door that Aoi had stepped 
through. With an inquisitive glint in her eyes, Tsubasa followed Aoi&#146;s 
path to the outside.    

The blonde swordswoman was sitting quietly on the ground next to the 
elder&#146;s mansion wall, unsheathing her blade. Tsubasa was a little 
thrown by that, and wondered if there were any remaining troops of the 
Himitsu Rikugun left hanging around. But she mellowed when she saw Aoi 
take a stone to sleek edge of her sword and brought it along in smooth 
motion. She was just sharpening her weapon. Tsubasa smiled a bit from 
the corner of her lips. Though she had only met this Aoi character a 
short while ago... there was something about her that just made the 
black-haired magic girl very... curious. 

Still donning that petite smile of hers, Tsubasa strode over to Aoi 
and crouched down to get a better look at her. Aoi was aware that 
Tsubasa was watching her, but said nothing to the girl, rather she 
continued sharpen her shining sword, Raiha. 

Since Aoi wasn&#146;t speaking, Tsubasa decided to break the ice. &#147;You find 
that fun?&#148;

After a short silence, Aoi spoke. &#147;Its not supposed to be &#145;fun&#146; by any 
length. I simply do this to keep my blade in top shape.&#148;

Tsubasa tried to ignore Aoi&#146;s hostility. &#147;Yeah, I guess so. I&#146;m kinda 
stupid like that. So... does your sword have a name?&#148;

Aoi remained silent. 

&#147;Hey, I asked if-&#147;

&#147;Yes, I heard you.&#148; Aoi cut in, startling Tsubasa a little. But all 
the same, she wasn&#146;t going to be put off here.

&#147;Well?&#148; Tsubasa probed playfully. &#147;Are you gonna tell me the name of 
your sword? I&#146;ll keep bugging you until you tell me.&#148;

The blonde Aoi surrendered with a perturbed sigh. Obviously this girl 
wouldn&#146;t leave her alone until she spoke up. &#147;Her name is Raiha.&#148;

Tsubasa&#146;s smile brightened. &#147;See? That wasn&#146;t so hard was it? Raiha. 
That&#146;s a really beautiful name. I can see why you take good care of 
her. Is that why you&#146;re sharpening her now? &#145;Cause you wanna take care 
of her?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148; Said Aoi harshly. &#147;Now are we done here? I really don&#146;t have 
the time for small talk, okay?&#148;

Even though she could see that Aoi was getting a little annoyed, 
Tsubasa didn&#146;t show any signs of caring much. That tiny little smile 
of hers did not go away. And for the first time, Aoi made actual eye 
contact with Tsubasa. From that, the magic girl&#146;s smile became even 
brighter. 

&#147;You have really pretty eyes.&#148; Tsubasa said softly. &#147;You know, baby 
blue has always been my favourite colour.&#148;

Aoi&#146;s eyes narrowed out and her cheeks flickered with the palest of 
light reds. Who was this girl to just come up and embarrass her like 
that?

&#147;What does that have to do with anything?&#148; Aoi spluttered quietly. 

Tsubasa giggled a little. They had only been talking for a few seconds 
and Aoi had already lost that cool disposition of hers. &#147;Well its 
true, isn&#146;t it? I really like blue eyes. I think they look cute but 
the same time, sorta mysterious. Don&#146;t you think so?&#148;

Aoi looked away from Tsubasa&#146;s probing gaze, her blush deepening a 
little. &#147;Do you desire something from me?&#148; She asked quickly, almost 
in haste.

Tsubasa shook her head. &#147;Nope. Not really. I just wanted to thank you 
for helping us all out. Those guys might have captured me if it 
weren&#146;t for your help. So... thank you.&#148;

&#147;I was just fulfilling my contract.&#148; Aoi declared quietly. &#147;If they 
took you, then we would not have been able to take you to Kyuukyoku 
Castle for Emperor Kagutaira.&#148; 

&#147;All the same thank you.&#148; Tsubasa stood slowly from her crouched 
position, still smiling at a clammed-up Aoi. &#147;I bet I&#146;ll have to repay 
the favour someday.&#148;
