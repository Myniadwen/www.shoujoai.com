<a href="../original/journend-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Nicole stood there frozen in the doorway, a confusing
mix of emotions swirling through the redhead&#39;s mind.
There had been times that she would have prayed for
Lynn&#39;s return, had longed for her on long lonely
nights, but now... that fire was gone. Instead she
felt irritation and more than a bit of anger at the
interruption.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to invite me in?&quot; Lynn asked,
pushing her glossy brown hair back with a practiced,
almost sensual gesture. She stood there apparently
casually in the morning sunlight, but her stance was
designed to highlight her beauty.

&quot;No,&quot; Nicole even surprised herself with that answer.
&quot;What do you want, Lynn? I thought we settled things
months ago.&quot;

Lynn was clearly taken aback. &quot;I was just hoping we
could catch up,&quot; she reached out to touch Nicole&#39;s
collarbone, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you.&quot;

Nicole shrugged the unwanted hand away angrily,
wondering how she could have ever found such a total
fake attractive. &quot;You aren&#39;t the type for making
casual visits,&quot; she answered her coldly then asked,
&quot;what do you want?&quot;

Lynn looked confused, almost as if things weren&#39;t
going the way she had scripted them out. &quot;I&#39;m
beginning to wonder why I followed your little friend
Rachel up here to the boonies,&quot; she sniffed, looking
innocently hurt.

&#39;Remind me to tell Rachel about that,&#39; Nicole made a
mental note, &#39;boy is she going to be annoyed that Lynn
followed her.&#39;

&quot;Here, I took the liberty of opening this for you,&quot;
Lynn drew out a large brown envelope from her coat and
passed it over to Nicole.

&#39;Ah, a light finally begins to dawn,&#39; Nicole thought
as she instantly recognized her publisher&#39;s name on
the envelope and realized that they had sent the
details on her last romance novel to her old address.
&quot;You shouldn&#39;t read other people&#39;s mail,&quot; she replied
as she took the package from her. Along with the usual
stuff the publisher sent was a separate envelope with
her cheque for the next advance, thankfully still
unopened.

&quot;Considering how much I&#39;ve contributed to writing your
novels,&quot; Lynn said smoothly, &quot;I only thought it fair
that I get a cut of this....&quot;

It took a great effort not to hit Lynn just then,
though the mental image did make Nicole feel a bit
better. &quot;If by contributed you mean that you cheated
on me and gave me plenty of writing material,&quot; she
said grimly, &quot;then maybe.&quot;

&quot;I thought that half the advance would be
appropriate,&quot; Lynn continued as if she hadn&#39;t heard,
&quot;if I don&#39;t get it I&#39;ll have to take steps.&quot;

Nicole toyed with the envelope a moment, a profound
sense of relief filling her. &quot;You know,&quot; she said
mildly, &quot;I wondered for awhile there if you just
stayed with me for my money.&quot; A sudden smile, &quot;It&#39;s
nice to have it confirmed.&quot;

Trying to get money out of an unwilling ex-lover was
one thing, but being accused of being a money grubber
was another, apparently, as the beautiful woman&#39;s face
went bright red with anger. &quot;Why you...&quot; Lynn snarled
out.

&quot;What&#39;s taking you so long?&quot; a gentle voice
complained.

Nicole turned and had to do her best not to laugh
aloud. Laura had walked into the room, looking sleepy
and very sexy, half in a very scanty robe. Her blonde
hair looked like spun silk, and her rich body was
clearly visibly beneath the thin material. She was
still a ghost, Nicole could see through her just
slightly, but a newcomer probably wouldn&#39;t notice.

&quot;Who,&quot; Lynn looked shocked.

Laura looked over at Nicole with a sultry smile, &quot;If
you don&#39;t come back to bed soon, I may have to start
on my own.&quot; With that she turned to walk out of the
room, her hips swaying slightly as she disappeared
around the corner.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Nicole gave Lynn a false smile, &quot;but we&#39;re a
little busy right now.&quot;

&quot;You.. I... &quot; Lynn stuttered before glaring at Nicole.
&quot;This isn&#39;t over,&quot; she bit out then swiftly turned and
walked over to her car.

Once she was gone Nicole shut the door with a happy
little sigh even as she heard Laura&#39;s voice come out
of nowhere, &quot;Did it work?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s gone,&quot; Nicole agreed. She raise an eyebrow,
&quot;Where did THAT come from?&quot;

&quot;A few of those novels you brought home, actually,&quot;
Laura admitted, &quot;I rather thought that subtle wasn&#39;t
going to work with her.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; Nicole laughed. She looked
curious, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you visible?&quot;

&quot;It took a great deal of effort to look that human, as
well as to become solid last night,&quot; Laura explained,
&quot;it&#39;s easier not to manifest visibly.&quot;

&quot;Not a problem,&quot; Nicole agreed. She yawned, sighing,
&quot;I need some coffee.&quot;

Laura chuckled softly, &quot;Just like every morning.&quot;

&quot;This from the person who likes startling me once a
day,&quot; Nicole said casually as she walked to the
kitchen, &quot;it&#39;s like clockwork.&quot;

A soft laugh was her only reply.

The writing that day went well, the words practically
flying on the pages. Momentum was built up as they
neared the home stretch, her and her characters, and
the final roadblocks to a happy ending were beginning
to fall. It was difficult at times to balance the
needs of the plot with her occasional inspirations but
she managed.

And throughout the day she and Laura talked. Nicole
enjoyed the conversation as much as the writing, Laura
occasionally nagging her away from the computer first
for brunch then a small midafternoon meal. The spirit
had adapted to the computer well enough to read over
Nicole&#39;s shoulder, doing a bit of beta reading and
amusing commentary. By evening Laura had regained
enough strength to be visible, a ghostly wrath sliding
through the rooms.

Dinner in the kitchen was pleasant, the steak and
potatoes Nicole made quite enjoyable. Laura eagerly
kept an eye on anything that needed watching on the
stove, turning things on and off as needed. &quot;Do you
ever miss things like eating?&quot; Nicole asked curiously.

:No,&quot; Laura shook her head with a little smile as she
said, &quot;it&#39;s been so long, I&#39;ve mostly forgotten what
it was like.&quot;

Nicole met her eyes, &quot;You&#39;re lying.&quot;

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Laura sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Nicole shrugged. She looked over at
Laura with a warm smile, &quot;You don&#39;t need to spare me
things, you know.&quot;

Laura nodded slightly, her expression thoughtful. She
looked curious, &quot;Do you think that Lynn will be back?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Nicole took a drink of soda,
&quot;she&#39;s not that stupid.&quot; She made a face, &quot;She&#39;s petty
enough to slag me around Vancouver, though.&quot;

Laura hesitated, &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, how did you two
become involved?&quot;

Nicole smiled, &quot;I was young and stupid?&quot;

&quot;Seriously,&quot; Laura replied.

Nicole picked at her food, &quot;When I first met her, Lynn
seemed like a lovely lady. She was beautiful,
exciting, all that.&quot; She sighed, &quot;The only problem
was, it took me a long while to figure out those
qualities were all surface, that she was shallow.&quot;

&quot;Beauty can be deceptive,&quot; Laura agreed. She looked at
Nicole after a moment, smiling seductively as she
added, &quot;I hope you haven&#39;t got anything planned for
tomorrow night.&quot;

&quot;I take it I&#39;m having company?&quot; Nicole asked, feeling
a tingle of anticipation.

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Laura agreed with a grin.</pre>
