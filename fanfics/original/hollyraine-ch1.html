<pre>Stage One: Holly&#39;s Book Report

**********

&quot;Oh, this one sounds great! What do you think, Jenny?&quot;

High noon at Victoria, Texas. If you took the time to circumnavigate the 
city streets and keen alleyways, you&#39;d come across the dozens of teens 
leaking out into the afternoon scenery. It was a bright Monday 
afternoon, and all schools in the area ended at 12.00, for some reason 
or another. This fact was not lost on Atlantic High School, as its fine 
female students were free to do as they pleased. Two of those students 
just happened to be shopping for CD&#39;s at a store on the local high 
street.

One of those two girls just happened to be the sexiest teen Texan girl 
in creation, Holly-Raine Johnson.

Holly&#39;s long probing fingers searched through the shelf of CD&#39;s and 
eventually they came across something her emerald eyes took a shine to. 
Holly withdrew the CD and flashed it in front of her friend, Jenny.

&quot;Not bad.&quot; Jenny said, observing the track list. &quot;I never knew you were 
a fan of rock music, Holly.&quot;

Holly shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not. But Summer is and it&#39;s her birthday next 
week. I just wanted to get her something special, y&#39;know?&quot;

Jenny nodded She could understand that. That was the sort of thing they 
always did for each other. Holly-Raine Johnson, Summer Andrews and Jenny 
Taylor had been the best of friends since they were crawling along the 
ground as kids. So it was no surprise that they pushed the boat out for 
each other when birthdays came around. Holly wanted to do something 
really special for Summer this year. Usually she just bought her 
something expensive, like a designer blouse or a piece of jewellery. 
While Jenny always got something that really made Summer happy, 
something that the girl always wanted, whether it was cheap or not. 
Holly decided that she was going to head in Jenny&#39;s direction, doing 
that exact same thing.

The brunette placed some of her shoulder-long hair behind her ear, and 
decided that was the CD that she wanted to buy for Summer. It was on 
sale too, even better.

&quot;Are you finished yet?&quot; Asked Holly-Raine directly.

Jenny continued to muse through the E-F section of the CD rack. The girl 
really was a finicky shopper Still, Holly shouldn&#39;t have questioned it. 
She herself was a bit picky, when it came to something like clothes. 
Jenny sighed and looked away from the CD rack. Maybe it was the 
environment that was making Holly-Raine so impatient. She was never much 
of a music person, not unless she heard a song that really charmed her. 
But that was the least of it. As Holly shopped with Jenny, she was not 
oblivious to the stares and lusty gazes she was receiving from the boys 
and young men dotted around each aisle. Sure, she was flattered by the 
attention, but that was not the kind of thing she was into.

Little Holly had her interests set *elsewhere* if you catch my drift.

&quot;There isn&#39;t anything I like.&quot; Jenny said. &quot;I&#39;m telling you, this is the 
last time I&#39;m coming to this place to buy a CD. The selection is 
terrible. Man, I was hoping to get rid of these gift vouchers, too.&quot;

&quot;Then lets go.&quot; Holly was already beginning to walk towards the payment 
desk, just at the corner of the room. In her haste, she grabbed Jenny by 
the waist and walked toward the desk arm in arm with her friend, 
Summer&#39;s CD in her hand. Jenny gave no resistance though; it looked like 
she wasn&#39;t going to find anything she wanted there anyway The two girls 
walked over to the payment desk, and got in line, behind a middle-aged 
woman. Eventually the line receded, until Holly and Jenny were next in 
line As Jenny walked up to the front to pay with Holly, she noticed the 
person working behind the counter.  Jenny noted her as a girl from their 
school, Atlantic High Her name was Cassie Robbins, a less-than-life girl 
who was a mere year younger than Jenny and Holly. Bashfully, she 
regarded her two fellow classmates with her smooth brown eyes. Cassie 
was a blonde, though her hair was awkwardly tied upwards to give her 
more of a `working girl&#39; look. While Jenny noticed her right off the 
bat, Holly didn&#39;t even realize that she went to school with Cassie, 
which wasn&#39;t a puzzler. Cassie was a very personal individual, a shy 
kind of girl that didn&#39;t mix in easily, which in turn meant she had very 
few friends. She wasn&#39;t exactly a grand picture either. The dress she 
was wearing was a full body daffodil print, the kind of thing that 
popular girls at school made real fun of. Plus, the metallic braces 
around Cassie&#39;s teeth were the perfect targets for the teasing she 
experienced at school.

Despite all that, Cassie always had a smile on her face. And to be 
honest, Holly-Raine loved shy girls, they were so endearing in their 
innocence, but Cassie was so much of a reserved person that Holly had 
never really noticed her.

Which was a shame for Cassie, because from the shy blush on her pouting 
cheeks, it was more than obvious that she had a crush on Holly-Raine.

Jenny noticed the yearning looks that Cassie was giving to an oblivious 
Holly, but said nothing about them. The last thing she wanted to do was 
embarrass Cassie by saying something

&quot;...Hey guys&quot; Cassie said shakily. She barely even trusted her voice 
around Holly.

The beautiful Holly-Raine looked over the counter as she heard herself 
regarded with familiarity Did she know anyone that worked in a CD shop? 
Holly stared at Cassie for a short while, as Jenny said hello. Still, 
she couldn&#39;t place the girl.

&quot;Do we know each other?&quot; Holly asked curiously. She didn&#39;t mean it to be 
rude, she just wanted to know how they knew each other.

Cassie didn&#39;t take it that way though. Her eyes lowered and the smile on 
her face fell a tad Holly barely even knew that she existed. &quot;We&#39;re in 
Miss Blake&#39;s English class together... I... um... I&#39;m Cassie Robbins...&quot;

Holly blocked out everything after `Miss Blake&#39; in abrupt horror. &quot;Oh my 
god!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Jenny asked.

&quot;Miss Blake&#39;s English class!&quot; She declared. &quot;She asked us to do a book 
report on any book we wanted, and she said it would be important! Well I 
forgot to write the paper! I read the book but I didn&#39;t write the paper! 
Geez, where am I gonna find the time to finish it?&quot;

Cassie&#39;s eyes brightened with an idea. &quot;Hey, I could help you ou-&quot;

Though Holly, in her panic, didn&#39;t hear a word Cassie said, and 
accidentally cut her off. &quot;Look, could you ring this up for me please, 
sweetie?&quot; Holly requested, slapping Summer&#39;s CD on the counter.

Cassie lowered her eyes again, their brief happiness lost once more. All 
she wanted was to just be with Holly, that was all. But the sexy 
brunette was hardly aware of her. Cassie sighed, and did as she was 
asked, rushing the CD over the scanner.

&quot;That will be $15.99.&quot; Cassie said dejectedly.

Holly nodded, went into the money purse in the back pocket of her denim 
jeans shorts, and withdrew the money she needed, $16.00. Cassie 
exchanged the money for the CD, the receipt and the one cent change. The 
moment Holly was handed the goods, she grabbed Jenny by the arm and 
dashed to the front glass doors to leave. Soon as Holly left, Cassie&#39;s 
head hung loosely. What did she have to do to get Holly-Raine to notice 
her?

**********

&quot;Um... Nadine and Dennis... struggle for love... desperate heart ache... 
ugh!&quot;

Holly-Raine scowled and slapped her HB pencil down in one go, breathing 
a puff of annoyance There was no way she could finish the book report 
before tomorrow morning. The young girl slumped into her elbow-raised 
palms, sighing deeply. She had gotten home by about 2.30, she had to 
help Jenny pick something out for Summer&#39;s birthday present. In the end, 
Jenny had bought Summer a silver neck chain, not too expensive, but it 
was one that Summer had apparently said she liked while window shopping 
After getting an ice cream for each other, Jenny and Holly-Raine 
separated and both went home. The moment Holly got home she climbed up 
the steps to her room and shut the door behind her. In an instant she 
was at the books, trying hard as all hell to get the book report 
started. She had done so, but Holly eventually realized that she just 
could not concentrate on the sucker.

The Texan teen flicked with her pencil on an empty sheet of A4 paper, 
sitting just beside her white painted wooden desk. She reprimanded 
herself while remembering her ill choice in book. She had chosen to 
write her report on a book called `The Calm Sea&#39; a romance of a 
half-decent calibre. At first, Holly had chosen the book because she 
thought it was a lesbian love story, between two women called Nadine and 
`Danni&#39;. As it turned out, `Danni&#39; was just a nickname for Dennis. The 
moment Holly learned that she lost interest. And even though she managed 
to bring herself to read through it all, she still couldn&#39;t be bothered 
memorize any of it. There was little to no hope that she could start and 
finish the book report in time for tomorrow&#39;s English lesson. It may 
have seemed strange that Holly was so desperate to get the work done, 
considering that she wasn&#39;t much of a work-friendly gal, but it was more 
than getting good marks. The teacher who taught English was Miss Blake.

Miss Blake was one of those rare teachers that you just don&#39;t meet 
everyday. Unlike most who were old, boring, miserable and stiff, Miss 
Blake was young, fun, joyful and loose And even more importantly (To 
Holly at least) Miss Blake was astoundingly gorgeous At the age of 26, 
Linda (Miss Blake) was a statuesque marvel. Her light grey eyes gave her 
a most mysterious look, along with that short, cropped blonde hair. She 
wasn&#39;t too tall, maybe a few inches more than most of the students. Her 
figure was striking though. A curvy, rounded body cleaved with tight 
creamy skin and long, thin legs. Her breasts were just the right shape 
and feel for Holly, small and firm, it matched her body in all aspects. 
Holly was sure that Linda was one of the hottest teachers in Victoria; 
the only teacher who surpassed her beauty was Miss Debbie Harding, who 
reigned proud and strong as Atlantic High&#39;s sexiest educator It was for 
these reasons that she didn&#39;t want to let Linda down, or get her mad 
Holly couldn&#39;t say that there were many adults that she respected, there 
were dozens she was hot for, but very few that she respected.

She wasn&#39;t to be misunderstood though. Holly would have loved to be with 
someone like Linda, even if it was just once, but she didn&#39;t know if it 
was possible. There was a rumour that she and Miss Harding were in a 
relationship. When some over eager students asked them about it, both 
Miss Harding and Miss Blake denied the claims. Holly-Raine wasn&#39;t stupid 
though. She could see they were in love; all you had to do was stare at 
them for a while. The hidden glances they exchanged in the hallways were 
just one of the many clues that aroused suspicion. But, whether she had 
a chance with Linda or not, Holly did not want to let her down.

The brunette sighed. In all truth, she didn&#39;t care much for academics. 
Her mom and dad had high expectations for her, but Holly wasn&#39;t 
interested in school. Or work for that matter Holly-Raine remembered 
that when she was younger, she used to dream that she&#39;d be married to 
some rich, sophisticated English princess, and they&#39;d move into a huge 
castle over looking the English Channel, living an easy, carefree life. 
Of course that was a crazy dream, and Holly had done some serious 
growing up since then, but she still loved the sound of the idea. That&#39;s 
the thing about dreams. They were always so appealing.

Holly let her sweet head of dark cinnamon-brown hair rest against her 
crossed shoulders and arms, as she leaned in on the table. &quot;If only 
dreams were real.&quot;

**********

&quot;...Holly...&quot;

Cassie sobbed into her tear-stained pillow. It was getting harder and 
harder to contain her feelings for Holly-Raine. She wasn&#39;t the first 
person to have a crush on Holly, and she most certainly would not be the 
last, but her feelings for Holly were a lot stronger than those that 
other people had. All you had to do was look at Cassie&#39;s room.

The floor was covered in used wet tissues, her notebooks were adorned in 
love hearts, with the phase `Cassie 4 Holly&#39; written in them. She even 
had a framed picture of the young brunette on her bedside table. Cassie 
managed to wipe the tears from her eyes and control her breathing, as 
she clasped the picture of Holly.

It wasn&#39;t an amazing capture; it was just a picture of a distant Holly 
in a tight fitting dress, talking to her friends, Summer and Jenny. The 
picture had been taken when 25 students from Atlantic High were taken 
for a weekend trip to San Antonio, for a state progress competition. 
Cassie had been entered in one of the competitions, in a poetry contest. 
She made the poem for Holly but had not given it to her, and 
unfortunately she came in second. But at the time, Cassie was too 
concentrated on Holly-Raine to even care. And that was still the case, 
four months later. Cassie had been struggling with this crush for nearly 
half a year, but it still didn&#39;t seem to pass. The only thing that could 
keep Cassie from crying all day was her job and her fiction stories, 
dedicated fully to Holly-Raine and herself.

Cassie snivelled as she recalled one of those stories, called `Save Me&#39;. 
Cassie would be at her locker during the day, doing nothing much, then 
the doors at the other end would burst open in a haze of light, 
Holly-Raine stepping through them. Cassie would simply stand there, as 
Holly walked up to her with eyes full of unhidden love and the unbridled 
lust that came with it. Without permission, Holly would press Cassie 
against the lockers and force her lips against Cassie&#39;s, claiming her in 
the middle of the hallway. The surrounding teachers and students would 
burst out into cheers of appreciation, as the two walked hand-in-hand 
out of the school and spend the rest of their lives together.

Of course the reality was VERY different. Holly-Raine didn&#39;t even know 
Cassie&#39;s name, let alone love her. It was probably that notion that made 
the unrequited feelings hurt so much. But those weren&#39;t the only stories 
that Cassie had written about Holly There were more *cough, cough* 
`stimulating&#39; stories that had stemmed from Cassie&#39;s overactive brain, 
ones that were certainly sexual in nature. They were nothing utterly 
weird though, just happy fantasies of she and Holly `merging&#39;, their 
mind, soul and body as one.

Cassie let her eyes slip shut and her head lull back onto the pillow. 
She stared at her framed image of Holly, held up by one hand, while her 
right hand pushed under the waist of her indoor skirt. It slipped past 
her panties, till the rogue hand reached the silky, slightly dampened 
curve of her steaming crotch.

&quot;...Holly...&quot; Cassie sighed as she manipulated herself, her mind 
dreaming of one of the many stories she had written about herself and 
Holly-Raine, `consummating&#39; their love...

CASSIE 4 HOLLY-RAINE FILES, ENTRY 107:

~*~ Set Me Free, Give Me Your Heart ~*~

&quot;It is almost midnight? I though we had agreed to meet at eleven? Why 
isn&#39;t she here yet?&quot;

Cassie&#39;s eyes looked over at the clock hanging above her door. It was 
five minutes to midnight, and Holly still was not there yet. They had 
agreed to meet with each other at Cassie&#39;s place at school, after their 
brief kiss behind the trees surrounding the sports field. Cassie was so 
excited about it. Holly could no longer contain the love she felt, and 
it was bubbling to the surface in remarkable fashion. The blonde decided 
to wear nothing much, just a simple chequered skirt and top, something 
she wouldn&#39;t dare wear to high school but was more than happy to wear 
for Holly.

Just at that moment, the door swung open. Holly-Raine&#39;s silhouette 
appeared from the light beaming upon her entrance, those silky tresses 
of brown hair flowing down her sweet elfin face. Cassie was at once 
ready to stand, to embrace her with strong caring arms, till she saw 
that distressed look on her lovely Holly&#39;s lips. It was then that she 
realized that Holly had been running here in the rain, her hair was 
clearly dampened by the rapidly growing bouts of drizzle from the night 
sky. But the look of unquiet was much more significant. It was almost as 
if Holly had made a realization that would change her life entirely.  
Cassie had to address the concern.

&quot;Holly...?&quot; Her voice called out. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

There were tears in Holly&#39;s eyes. &quot;Oh Cassie...  Cassie... I can&#39;t do 
this anymore. I can&#39;t. I know we kissed, but... I don&#39;t want that from 
you. I want... no I *need* your love, I need you to love me, I need you 
to hold me like no other has... I need you with all my heart...&quot;

&quot;Holly...&quot;

The girl in question slowly ambled across the room, moving towards a 
stunned Cassie. She sat down easily on the bed, staring into Cassie&#39;s 
eyes with her own emerald ones; they contained all the love you imagine.

&quot;I am in love with you, Cassie Robbins.&quot;

That was the simple statement that struck Cassie in the heart. To know 
that her Holly-Raine was in love with her, no mere crush but real love, 
was an experience that simply cannot be described. The elation Cassie 
felt was so enormous she felt that she might burst. But Holly had 
decided that those would be the last words she would speak. No other 
words needed to be said. Holly smiled at Cassie, a smile of un-revoked 
admiration and a deeply hidden desire. The brunette Texan clasped 
Cassie&#39;s cheek with both hands, and leaned in, tilting her head to the 
side.

Cassie&#39;s body was set on fire as she received her most desired kiss.

Holly-Raine sighed with contentment as her pink rosy lips connected with 
Cassie&#39;s, relishing that soft feel of the blonde teen. Holly wasted no 
time with patience, and pushed her tongue from between her lips to the 
slight separation of Cassie&#39;s, and thrust that wet digit into her love&#39;s 
mouth. Cassie&#39;s eyes opened up from surprise at Holly&#39;s forthrightness, 
her own tongue forced into action with Holly&#39;s more active one. Still, 
Cassie picked up the idea swiftly, their tongues began massaging each 
other, teasing and probing. At that point, Holly let herself become more 
loose, a form she was more prone to, and released her hands from 
Cassie&#39;s continuingly reddening cheeks. One of her lithe arms wound 
itself around Cassie&#39;s neck and into her mess of blonde hair. Holly ran 
her fingers though the tousled hair, pushing Cassie&#39;s head as close to 
hers as possible. The other hand moved down Cassie&#39;s body, giving quick 
squeezes to her breasts, shielded from view by the shirt. Holly&#39;s hand 
slowly moved downwards, until in reached her love&#39;s waist.

Holly broke the kiss with a gasp, drawing in air. Cassie did the same, 
her hands respectfully at her sides. She knew full well of what was 
about to come. Holly disentangled her hand from Cassie&#39;s hair, and used 
it to help the other hand undo the button skirt. After some effort it 
came off, and Cassie trembled as Holly pushed that (and her panties) 
down her legs. Removing Cassie&#39;s shoes and socks, Holly-Raine followed 
her desire and took off the panties and skirt. The lower half of 
Cassie&#39;s torso was completely revealed. Though she kept her mind and 
eyes focused on Cassie&#39;s wet womanhood, her busy hands yanked up her 
shirt as far as Cassie&#39;s body would allow, leaving the sweet teen&#39;s 
breasts in full view.

With one hand grabbing on to Cassie&#39;s left mound, the other hand poised 
at her thigh, Holly thrust her face into the ridge between Cassie&#39;s 
hips. The blonde girl cried out, her head dropping back onto her pillow. 
Cassie saw stars as Holly-Raine&#39;s long piercing tongue split apart the 
folds of her sopping recess.

The moans and cries poured out into the night as the two lovers 
expressed their love physically, un-afraid of what anyone else might say 
or think. That was all that mattered, the simple fact that they were in 
love.

**********

Cassie cried out, her voice coarse and drawn. Her eyes were tightly 
shut, her mouth wide open Cassie worked over her left breast with her 
left hand, squeezing the light flesh and pinching the pink nipple that 
topped it off. Her right hand she used to masturbate herself, pushing 
two fingers, index and middle, as deep inside herself as her body would 
allow. Her hips bucked against the penetrating fingers, her cries in 
rhythm with thrusts she made. Cassie continued to please herself with 
those wracking dreams of her sweet midnight angel, the luscious 
Holly-Raine. With one final jerk, Cassie buried her two fingers up her 
pussy as deeply as ever, eliciting its usual reaction, a throwing, 
rending, powerful climax that her body had no power to resist.

Though her screams seemed to indicate that she was enjoying herself, 
there was the unmistakable glint of dewdrop tears in her eyes.

**********

&quot;We shouldn&#39;t be doing this here... Linda...&quot;

Debbie Harding, better known to the student body of Atlantic High as 
Miss Harding, rolled her head backwards, as Linda Blake (Better known as 
the English teacher, Miss Blake) kissed and nibbled gently at the sweet 
flesh of her smooth neck. Her long fingers clamped down hard on the desk 
that behind was gently leaning on, while Linda, besotted with her eager 
lust, softly placed those butterfly kisses. The two of them were in one 
of the three main English Studies rooms, fairly concealed from view. The 
blind over the door window had been pulled down; there was no other way 
for someone to see what was going on. They were alone and free to do as 
they pleased for the next two hours. But Debbie still felt... nervous, 
fooling around with Linda at school like this. But then, after what 
happened last night, Debbie had doubted that she could stand to be 
around Linda.

Linda pulled back enough to speak. &quot;Why not? It&#39;s Tuesday morning; the 
kids won&#39;t be here for hours. Let&#39;s just enjoy the moment, okay?&quot;

Debbie pulled back, as best as she could. &quot;Stop for a second. I just 
came to ask you about the student report for Jenny Taylor. She&#39;s in my 
History class as well and I&#39;d-&quot;

Taking no notice of Debbie&#39;s wishes, Linda clasped Debbie by her full 
cheeks, by both hands, and drew her in for a short, abrupt but forceful 
kiss. It was a sort of way to silence her worries.

&quot;Who cares about that right now?&quot; The younger woman said, withdrawing. 
&quot;What matters is that I just want to be with you.&quot;

The moment Linda&#39;s hand touched her thigh, Debbie became much more 
direct. &quot;...You are trying to make me forget about last night, aren&#39;t 
you?&quot;

It was that comment that finally made Linda back away. The shorthaired 
blonde rolled her eyes in exasperation, removing her hand from Debbie&#39;s 
silky thigh. &quot;Do we need to bring that up? Lets just forget about it.&quot;

Suddenly, anger filled Debbie&#39;s eyes. &quot;Why won&#39;t you commit to me?&quot;

The statement was said with power. Its echo hung in the following 
silence like a wound in the flesh. Linda suddenly felt awkward around 
Debbie, the itch between her legs was now a fond memory. But this was 
not the first time this issue had gotten in the way of their 
relationship. The two had gotten together about eight months ago, during 
a particularly taxing school progress inspection. Debbie and Linda never 
really knew each other, but after that inspection, the school&#39;s teachers 
banded together and started to coerce themselves into working as a team. 
Unlike the rest of the teachers, Debbie and Linda genuinely liked each 
other. So much so that they started to see each other outside of school, 
at parties, clubs and bars. They really enjoyed each other&#39;s company, 
and respected each other academically, which made for an interesting 
combo. But, as fate would have it, simple friendship can always spring 
up into something more. After two months, Debbie and Linda were 
admitting the attractions to each other.

Since that day, the two had been having a secretive relationship, 
friends and co-workers at school, lovers at home. They had to keep the 
connection under wraps, lest fellow teachers or parents didn&#39;t approve. 
Things were great for the both of them though, and nothing seemed to be 
wrong. But then, just recently, their relationship had hit a snag.

Debbie had been talking about commitment.

Now although she didn&#39;t look it, Debbie was 34 years old and she had 
been around the block quite a few times. She couldn&#39;t count the amount 
of times she had started a relationship with a woman only to know three 
months down the line that it was going nowhere. She was at the stage in 
her life when she needed to have stability, as well as mind-blowing sex. 
It wasn&#39;t much to ask was it?

Needless to say, Linda didn&#39;t quite see it that way. She was 26, a full 
eight years younger than Debbie was. Though she was walking on the 
latter half of her twenties, she still felt 18 at heart. It was why the 
students liked her so much. Linda seemed to understand them on some 
level. She wanted to be spontaneous and carefree, life was a gift and 
she didn&#39;t want to waste it doing one simple thing for extended periods 
of time, hence the clash of opinions.

It wasn&#39;t revealed until last night. Linda made an evening lunch for two 
of them, just some lamb and side salads she had whipped up. Debbie came 
over as planned, at 11.00, and she planned to stay the night. During the 
meal, Debbie stopped eating and eagerly presented her lover with a 
velvet box. You didn&#39;t have to be an award-winner to know what that 
meant. The moment she opened the box, Linda was stunned at the gift 
Debbie had purchased. It was an exquisite silver ring, capped off with a 
beautiful sapphire stone. Linda was speechless. She loved it, she really 
did, but she froze the moment Debbie said,

`It&#39;s a sort of commitment ring. I see it as a symbol of my love for 
you.&#39;

Two words in that statement literally paralysed Linda. `Commitment&#39; and 
`Love&#39;. Linda cared for Debbie, that was in all respects a certainty, 
but they had never spoken about commitment, let alone love. After Debbie 
realized that no declaration of Linda&#39;s respective love was coming, she 
simply made her apologies and left, leaving behind the ring.

That was the real reason Debbie was not willing to `fool around&#39;. And it 
had also not escaped her notice that Linda wasn&#39;t wearing the ring. 
Linda stepped away from Debbie, walking around the desks that still had 
stray pieces of paper hanging around them

&quot;Maybe we shouldn&#39;t be doing this.&quot; Linda replied curtly.

Debbie&#39;s exotic eyes narrowed. &quot;Why are you avoiding the question? Why 
can&#39;t you commit to me?&quot;

&quot;I just can&#39;t, okay?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not an answer.&quot; Debbie retorted.

Linda continued to pick up papers. &quot;Well it&#39;s the only answer I&#39;m giving 
you, Debs.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t believe this,&quot; Debbie said quietly. &quot;Do you really need to act 
likethis?&quot;

It was then that Linda gained her own anger. &quot;Stop doing that!&quot;

&quot;Doing what?&quot;

&quot;Talking to me like I&#39;m one of your students! God, Debbie, you can be so 
patronizing sometimes, do you know that? I said I can&#39;t commit to you, 
end of story. Stop treating me like I&#39;m a child.&quot;

&quot;Then stop acting like one.&quot; Debbie jabbed. &quot;You know what? Maybe I need 
someone with a bit more maturity. Maybe we should just forget the whole 
thing.&quot;

It was then that Linda stopped picking papers. &quot;Huh? Wait a minute 
Debbie, we-&quot;

Too late. The door slammed shut with a jarring thud as Debbie stepped 
out of the room. Linda couldn&#39;t believe it. Had Debbie... broken up with 
her?&quot;

Chris Angel says,

- Hey all! Sorry for my absence, but I&#39;ve come back with a new fiction 
for you all. Now I know what you must be thinking, `why is Chris Angel 
starting a spin-off for Holly-Raine when he hasn&#39;t finished with Anna 
yet?&#39; Well I wanted to do a story that people could have a say in (i.e. 
what they&#39;d like to see in a certain chapter, who they&#39;d like to see 
doing the big nasty) and this way, I can be more flexible. So if you 
have a chapter idea you&#39;d like to see, just drop me a line. Be aware 
that the Debbie/Linda storyline is inflexible; I have definite plans for 
it so I can&#39;t change them around. Anything you might want for Holly is 
fine though. This was just an introduction chapter. I plan to be a 
little more `creative&#39; when it comes to future chapters I know we all 
can&#39;t wait for that! ^_^

- From the 20th of January, I will also be taking commissions. So if 
there is a story you&#39;d like me to write for you, e-mail me or if you&#39;d 
just like to talk and get to know me better, e-mail me at 
kandiface@hotmail.com

- There&#39;ll be two storylines in this fiction, one about Holly&#39;s exploits 
(before the arrival of Anna to Atlantic High), the other about the 
relationship between Debbie and Linda. I felt it was necessary to have a 
humoured, carefree storyline (Holly) to cheer people up and remind them 
of the fun a girl can have. And at the same time, I wanted to show a 
serious lesbian relationship (Linda and Debbie) to be real and present 
the snags and pitfalls a genuine relationship can go through.

- Thanks to all for the support and e-mails you&#39;ve sent me. And 
apologies to everyone who emailed me after the 15th of December, I 
wasn&#39;t home to reply to you. It&#39;s all your kind words that give me the 
strength to keep writing.
