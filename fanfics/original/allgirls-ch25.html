Ancelin Yi sighed. Ivory tried too hard. She wanted little to do with 
the persistent woman; Ivory was obsessed over her. Shouting her love out 
for hundreds to hear was apparently just the beginning: she had stuffed 
love poems in Ancelin&#39;s lockers, had sent flowers of all kinds to her 
home and classes, had sent her poor friend Farrah time after time to 
speak for her, and had sent her presents. She had even hung a 160-foot 
banner across the school&#39;s entire roof, openly declaring her abstinence 
from sexual conduct (the rumor she believed floored Ancelin the most), 
just to say how serious she really was. The sign had sent some people 
into awe, but it scared many others. Marbel tore it down before lunch 
and had put Ivory to hard labor to repay the debt (she didn&#39;t believe in 
suspension).

Now, in the second September week, mere days after her silent 
observation of the eleventh, Ancelin felt that at last, Ivory had to 
have run out of ideas or else gave up. She was wrong, of course: as soon 
as she stepped out of school grounds and onto the sidewalk, she saw the 
most outrageous stunt yet. The words ANCELIN IVORY had been carved on 
the side of a tree, with a big heart enveloping it. Despite feeling sour 
about her so-called fan, Ancelin couldn&#39;t help but snicker. Then she 
blanched: the next tree over had the word FOREVER carved on it; and the 
next one had AND EVER, and the one after that had the same, and so on 
and so forth.

Standing at a faraway tree was Ivory, busy cutting in the words to her 
latest declaration. Six trees so far had those words! Ancelin&#39;s face 
flew into ghastly surprise as Ivory turned around and waved happily. She 
scampered away once the police sirens could be heard, and in spite of 
the trouble she knew Ivory would get into, Ancelin couldn&#39;t help but 
laugh.

.........

Furious Hail had never been in a good mood or even a near-good mood, but 
she wasn&#39;t in a bad one either as she greeted Ivory. Tran was 
unreceptive towards her attentiveness. Having become more and more 
distant to her one-time bedfellow, Ivory all but ignored the wild, 
wretched woman in her quest to regain Ancelin&#39;s trust and love. Having 
Hail fawn over her so was tiresome, and deep down inside, Ivory knew it 
was wrong. She decided that she would just end their relationship, call 
it off, say what she needed and go about her business. After all, how 
could she pursue Ancelin with that other girl hanging onto her?

&quot;Listen, Haley,&quot; she began in a hurt voice, &quot;I don&#39;t think we should see 
each other anymore&#151;as a couple, I mean.&quot;

&quot;...What?&quot; The news stabbed her like an icicle.

&quot;I just... think...&quot;

Ivory had to be honest with herself, and with Hail. This would hurt them 
both.

&quot;I think you deserve better,&quot; she admitted sadly. Hail shook her head.

&quot;What? What do you mean? Ivory...&quot;

&quot;Look, I&#39;m a no-good sleazebag who&#39;s got too much of a violent and 
sexual past to be of any good to anybody. You shouldn&#39;t have to settle 
for me as a lover; you should be with somebody who understands you, 
and... wants to be with you.&quot;

&quot;What...? You mean...&quot;

&quot;I know I&#39;ve been inattentive; it&#39;s because, well...&quot;

Time to come clean, girl.

&quot;My sexual past permitted me multiple lovers. Sometimes I had three 
girls at once. I never thought I&#39;d actually begin to care for any of 
them outside of how they could pleasure me, or see them as anything else 
other than a good fuck. I... kind of... had a change of heart. I guess I 
really only went with you because I was horny and I needed sex, but... 
well, that&#39;s why you need somebody better, somebody who will love you 
and not just fuck and be fucked. I&#39;m sorry, Haley.&quot;

&quot;So... you had another girlfriend while you were with me.&quot;

Colder words might never have been uttered before under the sun.

&quot;Not... necessarily, but I was sort of in love with somebody else. 
Actually... I was in love with her before I started... anything with 
you. So... I&#39;m a slut, and that&#39;s not the first time I&#39;ve admitted it. 
It&#39;s just the first time I&#39;ve really been ashamed of it.&quot; Ivory hung her 
head bitterly, not brave enough or proud enough to keep it raised. So, 
the rebel had been defeated, the rogue crushed, the wild bed-hopper cast 
down in the dust, and by her own actions and words. Ivory really felt 
like she had wounded herself more than Hail; Hail felt like Ivory had 
reached into her body to pull her spine out&#151;from the front.

&quot;I don&#39;t fucking believe this.&quot; Hail&#39;s words were barely a whisper. She 
covered her agonized face with her hands and moaned. &quot;I can&#39;t believe 
this, I just can&#39;t fucking believe it!&quot;

&quot;There is nothing I can say that can make you feel better,&quot; moaned Ivory 
in response, &quot;except that you deserve better than me&#151;much, much better. 
And I know a woman like you can find it.&quot; Ivory&#39;s words felt like they 
were being branded on Hail&#39;s naked skin, by fire and ice and malice. She 
uncovered her face and bit back at her former lover with everything she 
had.

&quot;Fuck you!!! Fuck you, bitch! Fuck you!&quot; She stormed off before Ivory 
could say anything, off to cause more grief or wallow in misery or maybe 
even to kill herself out of hopelessness. Ivory Tran felt the same way, 
and but for the impossible promise of an unreachable love, she would 
have followed Hail in action. Feeling worse for the wear, but otherwise 
relieved that the nasty business was over, she took her breath and went 
forth to her next class.

Furious Hail went to see Ancelin.

............

Usha cradled helplessly in Blake&#39;s arms. She was silent and feeling 
miserable. Blake had said nothing. She combed her girlfriend&#39;s long dark 
hair, feeling its unbraided freedom as Usha breathed and searched for 
the right words to say. She had argued bitterly with Mira not long 
before, and felt wretched because it looked like the poor girl had been 
wounded, not merely offended. Usha knew she could get preachy at times, 
but Mira had touched upon delicate subjects: she had said just the right 
words to get Usha flying off her handle, and now the sweet girl was 
stubborn and angry, and refused contact. So Usha went to Blake, who took 
her and held her and was wise enough not to say a thing.

&quot;There are things I will apologize for,&quot; began Krishnan at last, &quot;and 
things I never can apologize for. I will say I&#39;m sorry for sounding 
bitter and superior, but my ideas stay. I just wish she realized this 
and incorporated a few into her own scheme. Could she not be flexible?&quot; 
Blake said nothing, so Usha looked up into her kind face, desperate for 
an answer.

&quot;Uh... listen, Ush, I&#39;m not smart like you, and I&#39;m not into politics. 
Olivia&#39;s the one to ask for about that stuff. Besides, I could never pay 
attention no matter how often I took my meds. But if you want my 
opinion, it&#39;s really not a good idea to change a person&#39;s beliefs. It 
sounds like that was what you were doing. You&#39;re basically saying Mira&#39;s 
wrong and you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she answered sharply, but Blake cut her off.

&quot;Now don&#39;t be stubborn; I heard it plain as a bell. You two are friends 
and girlfriends, but you&#39;re also rivals. So of course you&#39;ll have 
different ideas. And while we&#39;re on that, I thought you liked Mira&#39;s 
ideas.&quot;

&quot;Most of them, yes. This one... For goodness&#39; sake, she thinks women 
should stay at home until their children reach school age!&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s wrong with that? Isn&#39;t it good for mothers or even fathers 
to take care of their family for the day, at least until teachers can&#151;&quot;

&quot;But that is what nurseries are for!&quot; replied Usha quickly. &quot;Families 
can entrust children to nurseries, or after-school programs, and work to 
attain whatever dream or goal or potential they have.&quot;

&quot;But what if they want to stay home? Usha, you can&#39;t&#151;&quot;

&quot;They shouldn&#39;t!&quot; she snapped defensively. &quot;I think it&#39;s a repressive 
form of ancient societal ritual to keep women trapped in the cage of the 
house while men perform duties and&#151;glory&#151;and who-knows what else, social 
life and outings&#151;and you can factor in the dangerous increase of affairs 
if one goes and the other stays! And economical affairs, if nothing 
else, would certainly be eased if two paychecks came in instead of one.&quot;

&quot;But Usha, if the mother or father chooses to stay home&#151;&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t see how anyone could&#151;&quot;

&quot;Could I say a whole sentence without being interrupted?!&quot;

Usha froze. Blake expressed rare anger that even her close friends had 
not seen. They both took deep breaths.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for yelling,&quot; said Baum, calmer. &quot;I just think it&#39;s rude for 
people to interrupt.&quot;

&quot;I agree, and I deeply apologize for doing that, but I just...&quot;

&quot;Your beliefs, I know.&quot; Blake took Usha&#39;s hand and caressed it, then 
touched her face, then kissed her gently. &quot;I like you and respect you 
for it, especially since it&#39;s a life I&#39;ll never know. But everyone has 
an opinion, Usha, even me. You can&#39;t say that one is better than the 
other, especially if it&#39;s your own. You can only suggest, advise, speak 
when you&#39;re welcome, be silent when you&#39;re not, and listen when you&#39;re 
not sure.&quot;

Usha smiled lovingly, and caressed her girlfriend&#39;s face. Blake&#39;s words 
were simple but astoundingly powerful, like a mind clarified upon a 
mountain. She kissed her again and cradled herself into her arms. Blake 
held her and stroked her hair and disliked her not for her earlier 
arguments.

&quot;I think you should apologize to Mira,&quot; she said at last. &quot;You know, 
kiss and make up. It&#39;s the least you could do. I&#39;ll go and intervene on 
your behalf, but there are some things you should say that I can&#39;t. I 
don&#39;t want to mediate between you two every time you get into a fight 
you can&#39;t resolve.&quot;

&quot;We won&#39;t always be fighting, Blake,&quot; reminded Usha, slowly stroking the 
younger girl&#39;s arm. &quot;I care for Mira deeply, and now that I think about 
it, I do miss her and wish to make amends. I won&#39;t say she was right, 
but I will not say she was wrong either. I shall just... let our beliefs 
be, and hope they do not conflict with our relationship like that 
anymore.&quot; Blake smiled proudly at her girlfriend, and kissed the top of 
her head, smelling the scent of hair along the way.

&quot;Atta girl.&quot;

.........

Mira, of course, had been stubborn to accept apology.

Usha pleaded and spoke very kindly, but Mira kept her arms crossed and 
her face locked in a pout. Eventually Usha gave up, but not without at 
least saying how much she cared for Mira and wished the friction between 
them to be over. Blake intervened and got more out of her Dutch 
girlfriend, including how bad Mira felt and how she wanted to make up 
with Usha. Pride kept the two rivals apart, as it usually did in 
relationships like that. Usha was proud of her esteem, her intelligence, 
and her grasp of topics; Mira was proud of the fact that a laywoman like 
her knew so much and could affect the entire junior class as she did. 
They had both been hurt in their last argument, and neither had seemed 
willing to cave. When Usha voluntarily fell, Mira began feeling 
superior.

&quot;She loves you so much, and I do too, but you&#39;re being a cunt about it,&quot; 
said Blake gently, holding Mira&#39;s head in one hand and her fingers in 
the other. &quot;She apologized and admitted to being wrong about her method 
of arguing; you could at least do the same. Look, I love both of you 
equally, but you&#39;re starting to hurt even me with this discord. Now I 
know how you hold grudges and how you can&#39;t apologize easily when you 
think you&#39;re right, but Usha did something very brave, and you owe it to 
her to do the same.&quot;

Mira frowned. They were both right, and yes, she admitted to not liking 
it much.

&quot;Go on,&quot; whispered Baum, kissing her girlfriend&#39;s ear. &quot;Look, I know 
she&#39;ll accept your apology.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not worried about that, schat,&quot; sighed Mira, using a phrase Blake 
knew to be affectionate. &quot;I have been in thought for a long time. I am 
starting to feel afraid. Maybe you were right that time: what if this 
does not work out?&quot;

&quot;You mean our threesome?&quot;

&quot;Ja. I love you Blake, as much as I can love anyone I asked so suddenly 
and know so well. You are sweet and I think we would be good together. I 
also know you and Yusha like each other very much.&quot;

&quot;Well don&#39;t you like Usha?&quot;

&quot;I love her,&quot; sighed Mira, cuddling closer to Blake. &quot;She is rival, but 
good friend, and very sweet and beautiful. But she is also...&quot;

&quot;Stubborn? Like you?&quot; Mira frowned. &quot;She has a political mind, and 
speaks it whenever she can, like you? Intolerant to many things, like 
you? Honey, schat, you two are more alike than sisters. Hell, I&#39;m more 
worried about you two breaking it off with me than&#151;&quot;

&quot;No fear of that,&quot; whispered Mira gently, taking Blake&#39;s face in her 
hands and caressing it lovingly. She gazed into the other girl&#39;s eyes, 
her nose, her cheeks and forehead, her lips&#151;she kissed them all 
longingly, whispering words of comfort and love in her own language.

&quot;So you think Usha&#151;&quot;

&quot;She loves you, she loves you, she loves you so much, schat...&quot;

&quot;But you&#39;re scared of you two...&quot;

Mira said nothing.

&quot;Go apologize to her, you nut. And accept hers. And make out for a few 
minutes. Tell her how you feel. My God, if you never tell her anything, 
you will...&quot; Blake trailed off, but she knew her words had affected her 
girlfriend. Mira gradually slipped her arms away, released her grip, and 
stood, helping Blake to her feet. They embraced again, and Mira parted 
with a humble, slightly sad smile.

&quot;Doei. Wish me luck.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t need to.&quot;

The next day, Blake welcomed both her girlfriends with open arms. They 
attempted to share a mushy three-way kiss, and walked with arms around 
each other as they stepped, carefully and prudently, further and deeper 
into their relationship. They were all concerned about the odd 
arrangement working out&#151;whether or not they could stand each other, or 
get along, or bear it when one loved on the other more. But all 
relationships were like that; theirs was just special. And it was just 
getting started.

............

Hitomi drank deep of her mug. Abby brought her glass up and sipped 
through its straw. The younger woman rested her hand atop her head, 
elbow on the table. The elder rubbed her hands together. Madsen rubbed 
her face. Keeping sighed and smoothed out her long skirt. The mug became 
cold. The ice shrank. Silence.

&quot;Now what will you do?&quot; asked Abby. Hitomi shook her head.

&quot;Eat my dinner... pay my bill... walk you home... watch some TV... 
masturbate, take a shower, go to bed, and spend the weekend alone. Same 
thing I always do.&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s back to normal?&quot;

&quot;I can only hope. I can take it, but I&#39;m not sure about her.&quot; Sip.

&quot;She&#39;s strong. And she sounds very lovely. You did the right thing, 
though.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the only comfort I have.&quot; The mug went to her lips, paused, and 
returned to the table, empty. Keeping stirred her cold drink mindlessly. 
She decided to poke around a bit further.

&quot;So... any potential love interest?&quot;

&quot;None for awhile; I think I&#39;ll take a break. Funny, though: I&#39;ve not had 
a girlfriend since I was 22, and here comes one three years later, 
filling me up&#151;and I let her go. I did the right thing, but I can&#39;t help 
but think I passed up something good. Ah...&quot; With that last exasperated 
sigh, Hitomi became quiet and figuratively fell into Abby&#39;s grasp. She 
stretched her hand out and clasped the younger woman&#39;s palm lovingly.

&quot;Some day,&quot; she whispered, her voice nearly giving herself away, &quot;I hope 
you find the one you can love comfortably, and be they man or woman, I 
know they will love you likewise.&quot;

Even if it&#39;s not me.

&quot;Thank you, Abby. You are... so wonderful.&quot;

&quot;Hush,&quot; she said with a warm smile. &quot;A girl can only take so much credit 
before she bursts. You&#39;re quite good too; you&#39;ve no idea how much you 
meant to me these past two-plus years.&quot;

Someday, you will. Some day, not too distant, when all is right and I 
see you smile again, you&#39;ll know. I can&#39;t wait to tell you, but I will 
wait anyway.

Dinner was delicious, but more fulfilling to both women was the touch of 
their hands, the pleasure of their company, and the strength of their 
bond. They parted soon, and resolved themselves to the care of evening.

.........

Gabrielle joined Lilian in art class, and together they spoke and helped 
each other construct their current project. They both still looked like 
they had seen better emotional days, although Gabrielle&#39;s mood was 
better due to her friends&#39; attentiveness. Janine, Victoria, and Olivia 
helped her and comforted her and offered her their strength, especially 
young Miss Johnson, who assured her friend that her cousin meant no ill 
will. But Lilian had nobody, save her pets and now Gabrielle&#151;but that 
seemed to be enough, for Miss O&#39;Shannon&#39;s company brightened her and 
made her burden seem less impossible to bear.

Gabrielle invited Lilian to stay at her house for the night, but she 
refused politely, saying that it would be best, for the time, to stay at 
home and assure her parents she had not abandoned them or her 
birthright. The two parted at the end of the day, still feeling empty, 
but the void was not so big as it might&#39;ve been. Night came quickly, 
resolving very little, and many problems stayed to stare everyone down 
the following day, and week, and month, for no day has conclusion, no 
night has end, no trouble has easy solution.

But love would find a way. It always did.

&quot;Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it 
is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily 
angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but 
rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always 
hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails. ...&quot; &#150;1 Corinthians 13: 4-8</pre>
