<pre>&quot;OH YEAH! I AM THE GREATEST!&quot; The man behind the counter stared as the 
girl in front of him completed a triple spin with an air punch. He had 
to admit that she was one of the most beautiful women he had ever seen. 
Long white hair and a skin tight outfit consisting of hot pants and a 
bikini top neither of which could be called concealing. On her head she 
wore a black bandana, on her hands a pair of matching fingerless gloves 
and a backpack.  Up until now it had been a quiet friday morning at the 
mall and now everyone had stopped to stare at this lunatic. Shaami held 
up the gold necklace letting the light reflect off it in pretty 
patterns. &quot;Maam that necklace costs over twelve thousand dollars. I 
think this one here might prove to be a little more affordable...&quot; The 
clerk at the jewellery store fell silent. The girl had just placed a 
diamond the size of his head on the counter. &quot;I&#39;ll take it!&quot; She shouted 
gleefully. Shaami dashed out of the jewellery store and looked to the 
elevator. It was full. Oh well, she was only five floors up. With this 
thought in mind she leapt over the railings and began her descent.

In a small dojo not so far away Lilly woke up. She shook her blonde head 
back and forth. Something was stuck to her forehead and she had a very 
good idea of what it was. She removed the stickee note, reached for her 
glasses and began to read.

HAPPY ANNIVERSARY! Just lettin&#39; ya know that I cooked breakfast (well 
sorta) and that I&#39;ve just gone out to pick up some stuff.

PS When I get back you&#39;re gonna be so proud!

PPS You look cute in bunny PJs!!!

Lilly blushed as she read the last line. Something was bothering her 
though but she couldn&#39;t put her finger on it. Then it hit her. Shaami 
cooked?! She jumped out of bed and rushed into the kitchen expecting the 
worse. She was surprised to find the room intact. What surprised her 
even more was the pile of delicious looking pancakes on the table. Still 
unsure she took a tentative bite. Lilly grimaced and made a mental note 
to tell Shaami that you shouldn&#39;t put salt on pancakes.

After falling five floors Shaami looked pretty good. She would probably 
have looked better if she wasn&#39;t soaked through. Who puts a fountain in 
the middle of a store anyway? Good thing she was about to go buy a... 
Shaami cringed, a dress. The image of Lilly in her PJs popped unbidden 
into her mind. Standing knee-deep in water she pointed to the clothes 
department and said &quot;For the woman I love I will find the perfect dress! 
Today WILL be perfect and there is nothing anybody can do about it!&quot; 
With great swiftness she somersaulted out of the fountain and ran into 
the store. She also ran into the back of a sales assistant. The woman 
was thrown about five feet into a clothes rack and was not happy in the 
slightest. Shaami quickly picked the woman up and placed her on her feet 
apologising profusely. Shaami reeled as inspiration snuck up on her like 
a rhino. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry. Umm... could you help me, I really need to 
find a dress.&quot; The woman almost said no until she looked into Shaami&#39;s 
eyes which were quickly filling with tears. &quot;What kind of dress are you 
looking for?&quot; She asked. Shaami&#39;s face lit up with joy as she said, &quot;I 
want a pretty one, ya&#39; know all fancy and stuff.&quot; They wandered into the 
dress area and Shaami shuddered. As she sat on a stool the nice lady 
brought forth a variety of garments in a wide range of colors. They 
spent hours searching. Shaami started sobbing. For some reason this 
soaking wet girl brought out the assistant&#39;s maternal instincts. &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong dear are you OK?&quot; She said softly. &quot;I just want to look special. 
Lilly looks special everyday so why can&#39;t I for just one night?&quot; Shaami 
wailed in response. Shaami&#39;s crying stopped abruptly. She shut her eyes 
and pointed randomly. Opening her eyes she looked at the dress she had 
chosen. It was black like every outfit Shaami owned but it sparkled. 
&quot;Thank you so much kind lady I want that one!&quot; Reaching into her pack 
she drew forth a handful of perfectly cut diamonds. Giving these to the 
kind assistant she took off at top speed.

Lilly was sweeping the dojo wondering when that crazy girlfiend of hers 
would get back, when she heard an almighty crash. That would be Shaami 
knocking the door off its hinges. Another crash, probably her bedroom 
door and then... Shaami lifted Lilly into the air and kissed her on the 
cheek. Lilly was shocked into silence. Shaami was wearing a dress and 
had taken off her bandanna. In her left hand she held another small 
stickee note. &quot;Lilly I kinda wrote a poem for you I hope you like it 
*ahem: I love you so much

          You mean everything to me

          My flower, Lilly.&quot;

The blonde blushed for the second time that day. &quot;I got reservation 
thingies for a restaurant too.&quot; Shaami added. Never in their three years 
of dating had Shaami put so much thought into... anything. Lilly hurried 
into her room and changed into a pale pink cocktail dress.

A table for two, candlelight and violin music. The two girls looked into 
each others eyes knowing that at that moment there was no place they&#39;d 
rather be. The food was delicious and the music soothing. Shaami then 
got out the golden necklace and placed it in Lilly&#39;s hand. She was so 
happy she almost cried. It was when they left the restaurant that things 
turned sour.

Choosing to take the scenic route through the park they found themselves 
surrounded. A gang of thugs had followed them out of the restaurant. &quot;Ok 
girlies hand over the chain and we promise not to rough you up too 
badly.&quot; The tallest of the five said holding up a dagger to emphasise 
his meaning. &quot;TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE PERFECT!&quot; Shaami screamed 
slamming the guy into a tree knocking him out instantly. The second thug 
slashed at her with his own knife but succeeded only in tearing a hole 
in her dress. Tears of rage were now pouring down her face a she said, 
&quot;Why did you have to ruin it?&quot; She grabbed the man by the throat and 
threw him into a trash can. The three remaining criminals lunged for 
Lilly, hoping to take the necklace and run. &quot;HOW DARE YOU!? You are not 
going to touch her!&quot; Within a minute all five men were out cold. Shaami 
leaned against an oak trying to catch her breath. But she couldn&#39;t. 
Holding her side she could feel something warm and wet and as she 
slipped into unconciousness she guessed it had to be blood.

When she finally woke up she was in for quite a surprise. She was in her 
room and her torso was wrapped in bandages. She quickly sat upright 
looking for Lilly. &quot;Shaami! You&#39;re OK I was so worried.&quot; Lilly was 
sitting in a chair right next to her. &quot;I was so afraid you weren&#39;t going 
to wake up, I don&#39;t know what I would do without you... Shaami I love 
you.&quot; Lilly had never said it before but now that she had Shaami was the 
happiest girl in the world. &quot;Lilly, as long as your here I&#39;ll always 
wake up cos&#39; for you I would do anything.&quot; Shaami leaned over and kissed 
the love of her life on the lips.

Maybe the day had gone perfectly after all.</pre>
