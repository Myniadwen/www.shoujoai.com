<a href="../original/testfire-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Motoko Fitzgerald smiled as she set the cards down,
the Asian redhead looking very satisfied as she
purred, &quot;Read &#39;em an weep.&quot;

Jack Scott blinked at her cards then sighed, tossing
down her hand. Pushing her sandy blonde hair from her
eyes she said, &quot;Who would have thought a hostess would
be a card shark?&quot;

Motoko&#39;s eyes twinkled with amusement as she asked,
&quot;What do you think we do, in between dealing with our
clients?&quot;

&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; Jack chuckled. Her jeans
and white T-shirt suited the slim young woman, hugging
her body while leaving her plenty of freedom of
movement. &quot;I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re not playing for money,&quot;
she added.

&quot;I&#39;d let you run a tab,&quot; Motoko suggested impishly.

Rummaging through Jack&#39;s closet they had found a
oversized sweatshirt and a pair of old jeans for her,
much more comfortable than the clothes she had been
wearing last night. They fit her well enough, but
whenever Motoko bent over the loose shirt revealed a
startling expanse of breasts and the jeans looked
painted on her curvy hips and legs. Taken all
together, it was not helping Jack concentrate much on
her playing.

&quot;In fact...&quot; Motoko started when Jack held up a hand
to silence her.

&quot;There&#39;s somebody coming up the hall,&quot; Jack said as
she reached to the table between them and picked up
her pistol.

&quot;How do you know....?&quot; Motoko blinked at Jack in
surprise.

&quot;There&#39;s a squeaky floorboard in the hallway,&quot; Jack
explained shortly. In a moment they saw a figure on
the other side of the frosted glass and Jack called
out before they could knock, &quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;My name is Cole,&quot; she said as she turned the door
handle and went inside, &quot;and I hope to be of
assistance to you, Miss Scott.&quot;

Jack&#39;s eyes swept up over the woman, studying her
intently. The black hair was a lovely mane on her
head, then flowed smoothly over the catgirl&#39;s body in
a thin layer of fur. Over that she wore pretty skimpy
clothes, a short skirt and tight top, giving her a
sexy, almost trashy look. Still, those golden eyes
were dangerous, as was the muscle under the fur.

&quot;She works for Bannon,&quot; Motoko hissed softly to Jack.

&quot;Which doesn&#39;t necessarily make her a black hat,&quot; Jack
answered mildly. Raising her voice she addressed Cole,
&quot;And how can you assist me, Miss Cole?&quot;

&quot;I can think of so many ways I could... help,&quot; Cole
purred as she studied Jack with a predatory look on
her lovely face.

Motoko frowned eve as she unconsciously moved closer
to Jack, &quot;I&#39;d think she could find that kind of help
on most street corners.&quot;

&quot;Dressed like that,&quot; Cole studied Motoko a moment as
she cattily added, &quot;you&#39;d probably know all about
that.&quot;

Jack never understood why, when two beautiful women
ended up in a room together, they just had to snip at
each other this way. Still, as entertaining as it was
to watch there was business to attend to. &quot;I assume
you&#39;re here on behalf of Bannon,&quot; Jack said as she cut
off Motoko&#39;s return salvo, &quot;state your piece, please.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for reminding me,&quot; Cole smiled faintly.
Taking a breath and not incidentally making her
breasts bounce under her shirt she said, &quot;Yes, the
mayor sent me, he wanted to offer his help in dealing
with Miss Fitzgerald&#39;s situation.&quot;

&quot;Out of the goodness of his heart?&quot; Motoko asked
softly.

&quot;No,&quot; Jack said dryly, &quot;because he quite reasonably
expects that I think he could have made the threats,
and wants to ease my suspicions.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Cole admitted, &quot;but Bannon has no
motive in doing this.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on,&quot; Motoko rolled her eyes.

&quot;She&#39;s right,&quot; Jack said as she gave Cole a hard look,
&quot;Bannon does have a motive. If he can blackmail
Davidson into working for him he could use that
influence to weaken the Shogun&#39;s defenses at a
critical moment.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s clumsy, chancy and too dangerous for Bannon to
try,&quot; Cole said flatly, &quot;my employer isn&#39;t that
stupid.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think he was dumb enough to try screwing
with the courier guild,&quot; Jack indirectly referred to
her earlier run in with Bannon and his men, &quot;but he
did.&quot;

Cole winced, &quot;Point.&quot;

Motoko clearly wanted to ask about what Jack was
talking about, but she also was pretty sure Jack
wasn&#39;t going to tell her. &quot;For all we know,&quot; Motoko
frowned, &quot;Bannon could just want you close enough to
take a shot at me when you get the chance.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Jack murmured, &quot;you&#39;re sounding properly
paranoid.&quot;

&quot;As if I&#39;d ever get a chance,&quot; Cole scoffed, &quot;Jack is
good, you know.&quot;

Sadly, that was when all hell broke loose. The window
facing on the street exploded inward as Jack tackled
Motoko aside, glass scattering around the office while
the flier hit the ground, gun at the ready. Still,
Jack was faster, gun in hand even as she shielded
Motoko and took a shot, slamming the flier out the
window again with a bullet.

&quot;I hear people coming up the stairs,&quot; Jack barked as
the half dragged Motoko to the door.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we try to defend here?&quot; Motoko asked her as
she followed Jack out of the office into the hallway.

&quot;No place to easily retreat from,&quot; Cole said as the
followed them out, her eyes sweeping the long hall and
ears twitching.

&quot;I am not starting a fight with my back to the wall,&quot;
Jack said as she ran to the other end of the hall and
the stairs there. From behind them they could hear the
other stairwell door slam open and people begin
running out.

&quot;There&#39;s gone,&quot; a man&#39;s voice yelled.

&quot;Then find them, you idiots,&quot; a familiar sounding
female voice said, &quot;search the whole floor, she can&#39;t
have run far!&quot;

&quot;Rose,&quot; Cole recognized the name almost instantly, not
to mention the strong scent of the perfume the lady
wore.

&quot;As in the Denman street enclave?&quot; Motoko asked as
they raced downstairs together, eventually reaching
the first floor.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jack&#39;s thoughts raced as she continued,
&quot;though I doubt Wolf approved it. She&#39;s too busy
digesting the territory they recently acquired to want
to pull something like this.&quot;

A figure lay slumped in the lobby, blood smeared on
the side of his head. Cole moved over to check him,
recognizing the building&#39;s manager, Mike. &quot;He&#39;s alive,
looks like someone got a bit enthusiastic knocking him
out,&quot; she looked up at Jack with a frown.

&quot;He probably would have objected to them coming in,&quot;
Jack said with barely controlled rage. Together they
dragged him in behind the front desk then she studied
her two companions. &quot;I know somewhere we can go, but
it&#39;s going to be dangerous,&quot; she warned.

&quot;You&#39;ve protected me so far,&quot; Motoko looked at her
trustingly, &quot;I&#39;ll follow your judgment.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d call the boss for troops,&quot; Cole frowned, &quot;but
we&#39;re on the Shogun&#39;s territory. Ad I bet you can&#39;t
ask him for help.&quot;

&quot;I could,&quot; Jack said, &quot;but I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be doing
him any favors, since it would force him into a war
with the Wolf.&quot;

&quot;And he&#39;d have to go right through Bannon&#39;s territory
to do it,&quot; Cole added. She studied Jack a moment, &quot;Are
we bringing Mike along?&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t, not where we&#39;re going,&quot; Jack said firmly,
&quot;besides, Rose has no reason to hurt him with us
gone.&quot;

Cole&#39;s eyes widened as she realized where Jack
intended them to go, &quot;You have got to be kidding.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re basic charter is to help women in trouble,&quot;
Jack said as they headed out to the street, &quot;I&#39;d say
we fit the bill nicely.&quot;

&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Motoko asked them patiently,
having fallen a few steps behind in the conversation.

&quot;The Sisterhood,&quot; Jack shrugged.

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Motoko whimpered.</pre>
