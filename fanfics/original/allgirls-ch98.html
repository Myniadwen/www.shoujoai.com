<h1>All Girls School (part 98 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch97.html">Back to Part 97</a><pre>&quot;Bizarro World: All Boys School&quot;

Victor Grissom knew he was late to Frederick Douglass Public High School 
for Boys, he just hoped none of his friends would make a spectacle of 
it. Wheeling before him, as always, his boyfriend Augustus Tramble 
looked irritated that he, too, would be tardy for classes, the first 
time it had happened since he had the chicken pox. It honestly wasn&#39;t 
Victor&#39;s fault they were late&#151;his pet scorpion Tracey Richards had 
gotten out again, and it took time to find the little critter and 
convince the other Grissoms to not squish him.

&quot;I swear,&quot; lamented poor Augustus, &quot;sometimes I really do think you like 
that scorpion of yours more than me.&quot;

&quot;Now, now,&quot; said Victor, playing with the older boy&#39;s dark hair, &quot;you 
know very well I can&#39;t hug a scorpion, and they&#39;re not much for kissing 
or other fun activities.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but if there&#39;s a crisis, you usually choose her over me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because I know you can take care of yourself, Gussy-boy.&quot; Augustus 
snorted and resolved to not speak to his lover for most of the day. He 
still considered himself lucky if being tardy was the least of their 
worries: his brother Julius and Victor&#39;s close friend Jean were still 
trying to solve some &quot;issues&quot;, and to go into that would take all day. 
Speaking of which...

&quot;You know Madsen&#39;s gonna fry you,&quot; said Augustus, taking his boyfriend&#39;s 
hand before exchanging a kiss. Victor smiled sadly.

&quot;Yeah, well, I kinda needed the extra credit, and knowing him, he&#39;ll 
really lay it on me in the worst way. See ya.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, bye.&quot; Victor knew he didn&#39;t have time to watch his boyfriend 
scurry off, so he knocked on Mr. Madsen&#39;s door and waited for it to be 
open. Soon, the familiar, handsome, stern face of Thomas Madsen greeted 
the truant, and Victor turned red.

&quot;You show this class a great discourtesy,&quot; said the half-Japanese, 
half-American Literature and Writing teacher, &quot;by coming here late, Mr. 
Grissom. Take your seat; I&#39;ll deal with you later.&quot; Poor Victor couldn&#39;t 
have been more red if he had dunked his face in a can of crimson paint, 
so amidst stares of his classmates he shriveled into his seat. A few 
spared him sympathetic glances: the loveable Irish bug Gabriel O&#39;Shannon 
knew what it meant to be late to Madsen&#39;s classes, Oliver Johnson 
greeted his old friend with a wave, Jean Bautista gave him a sad shrug, 
and Blake Baum...

Well, three out of four wasn&#39;t bad. If only somebody had taken their 
meds.

&quot;I hope,&quot; said Tommy Madsen as he walked around the room, &quot;that you all 
have been studying for your big Shakespeare test. I&#39;ve given you every 
warning I know of, and I&#39;ve quizzed you and pushed you well beyond the 
reasonable point, so now nobody has any excuses. Now since it is test 
time, I feel a little music&#39;s in order. Any suggestions?&quot;

&quot;Beethoven sounds nice,&quot; suggested Lilo Nachtheim. Madsen smiled.

&quot;Ah yes, who but a German can best understand his works? Very well; you 
may all begin once the music starts. The test is over when it ends. 
Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve chosen a long symphony.&quot; That wasn&#39;t much of a relief, 
but it was better than nothing. The boys all buckled down and began 
their test once the song played (it was the Seventh Symphony), and even 
the most troublesome among them didn&#39;t feel compelled to cheat. Madsen 
had the eyes of a hawk anyway, and he was totally merciless towards 
those who looked at other&#39;s answers.

As Alexander Blair filled in blanks and circles, his mind drifted to his 
boyfriend, Ronnie Marcos. They had suffered yet another argument, this 
one originated by Ron himself. Alex felt bad because he had said some 
things he didn&#39;t mean, and he missed seeing Ronnie that morning, as he 
usually did. He spoke it over with Madsen, who offered his best support 
and words of wisdom. Funny how once upon a time, Blair had despised 
those awful maxims, and now he sought them out!

Julius Tramble was totally focused, but last night...ugh! He 
successfully got it out of his head (music always was a better 
distraction), but he knew he would have to confront him again once it 
was all over. They had stayed over at his house, Jean and himself, and 
the two ended up, for lack of a better term, reenacting their 
tongue-wrestling of New Year&#39;s Eve. He didn&#39;t mean for things to turn 
out that way, but Jean looked so adorable with his shirt off, and he 
fought so hard to not touch that soft bare chest. Ugh! And now he was 
thinking those awful thoughts in class! So much for getting over it.

Jean, for the record, was thinking of a different Julius. Lousy Caesar.

&quot;Shit,&quot; grumbled Ivan Tran as he trudged out of class. &quot;I totally tanked 
that test. Madsen is gonna kill me. But how the fuck am I supposed to 
pay attention to Shakespearian shit like that?! It&#39;s boring!&quot;

&quot;Aw, quit complaining,&quot; grumbled Xavier Walker, giving his soccer pal a 
shove. &quot;At least you&#39;re in good condition for the next game. Thanks to 
my idiocy, I have to sit out a game. If Madsen&#39;s gonna kill you, then 
Lino is gonna kill me.&quot;

&quot;Nah, Lino&#39;s cool, and it&#39;s not like the team will die without you. 
We&#39;ve got the incredible amazing asthmatic Kit Parkin, after all.&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;re also missing Ross cuz&#39; of his cancer. Poor fella.&quot; Ivan 
moaned an agreement, and had to admit, failing a test did seem to be the 
least of his worries. He and X would part ways soon, one to his 
boyfriend and the other to his class.

&quot;Well, I better go. Ancel&#39;s expecting me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that hot French guy? Man, I still don&#39;t know how you hooked up with 
a stud like him!&quot;

&quot;Good timing, I guess. Aw, who knows; maybe it was meant to be.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah right. Later.&quot; The guys went down two different hallways, each 
to a brief destiny, and the clockwork of Douglass continued to grind...

......

Janelle Raulson&#39;s history class was hardly exciting, even when the Hindu 
gambling addict got to the &quot;good parts&quot;, like the Crusades or the French 
and American Revolutions. Personally, Miron van Dijk was bored with it, 
and wished just for once that his teacher would talk about fantasy 
instead. He wanted to slump down and just sleep&#151;he had stayed up all 
night watching Neon Genesis Evangelion for the sixth time&#151;and visions of 
Evas, Angels (especially Kaworu!), and Instrumentality danced through 
his head. Now if only there were a committee like that here in the real 
world...

&quot;Mr. van Dijk?&quot; said Raulson, glaring hard at the poor Dutch guy. &quot;Are 
you paying attention?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mr. Raulson.&quot;

&quot;Then kindly outline the Panama Canal discussion for us.&quot; Uh-oh. Miron 
was caught. He only knew two things about the Panama Canal: it was in 
Panama and Teddy Roosevelt helped get it off the ground. He walked up to 
the board and utterly failed to satisfy his teacher. &quot;I guess,&quot; Raulson 
grumbled, &quot;you&#39;ll be needing more homework then.&quot;

&quot;But sir, my anime club is having an emergency meeting! I have to be 
there!&quot;

&quot;I suggest you get your priorities straight, Mr. van Dijk,&quot; said Raulson 
coldly. &quot;Graduating from this school is just a little more important 
than watching your shows.&quot; Miron made a fuss, but Raulson could get 
scary when he was really pissed like that. Since it was no use arguing, 
Miron glumly returned to his chair, wondering how he was going to get 
through this. Without him, the anime club would be in ruins!

&quot;Boy,&quot; muttered Jon Lu to himself, &quot;that&#39;s harsh. Maybe I can help poor 
Miron somehow.&quot;

&quot;Mr. Lu!&quot;

&quot;Y-yessir! A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!&quot;

&quot;Very good, Mr. Lu. However, we are not studying palindromes.&quot;

&quot;Y-yessir.&quot; Raulson gave the flustered blonde one last gaze, then 
returned to his lesson. Lu felt relieved that he had dodged the bullet; 
Ray Zanders just rolled his eyes, wondering if his mischievous lover was 
ever going to grow up.

When Heero Love explained the situation to his drama teacher, Elmer 
Post, he rubbed his chin and dove into thought. If Raulson knew just how 
important this anime meeting really was to Miron, he wouldn&#39;t have 
burdened him like that, even if he wasn&#39;t paying attention in class. 
There was no changing the past now, but perhaps somebody would be 
willing to take his place...

&quot;I really can&#39;t go,&quot; said Post. &quot;Soma and I have a date, you know, and I 
don&#39;t like being late.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, how&#39;s it going between you two?&quot;

&quot;Fantastic,&quot; sighed Post, staring dreamily into space. Few people in 
Douglass could withstand the sickening sweetness that was Elmer and 
Soma, and they were either very kind, very patient, or a little on the 
stupid side.

&quot;Oh, uh, that&#39;s great. So you&#39;re out, huh? You think I should ask Mr. 
Keeping?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Abbot&#39;s always busy with his own lover. He and Tommy may as well be 
Siamese twins.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what people are saying about you and Soma, sir,&quot; remarked Yancy 
Montgomery. Elmer made a face and cleared his throat.

&quot;Uh, ahem. Let&#39;s move on to a different subject. Heero, I&#39;ll do Miron 
this favor, but I expect him to get his grades up by the middle of this 
month. You know that May is coming soon, and if he doesn&#39;t shape up, 
he&#39;ll be held back a grade.&quot; Heero understood, chewing his lip grimly 
until Miron actually showed up. He looked miserable, which was a 
terrible contrast to his happy-go-lucky attitude.

&quot;Goodness, the Dutch Dijk looks like he got dumped by Vash the 
Stampede,&quot; muttered Gabriel. Miron plopped down in his seat, ears and 
hair drooping like a horse&#39;s, and was immediately seen to by his 
friends. Everybody offered to help, but Miron had really set his heart 
on that meeting. One soul in the group, however, was brave enough to 
stand forth in spite of the bullying that Miron had put him through.

&quot;Hey, uh, if you can&#39;t be there, I can go. I mean, I know I&#39;m just a new 
member now, but...&quot; Miron looked up and smiled broadly at the shy face 
of Kim Miklos, his new crush. Kim was a beautiful but shy blonde, 
somebody Miron ached to know better (through one way or another!), and 
seeing him volunteer like that out of nowhere really lifted Miron&#39;s 
heart.

&quot;You&#39;d do that?&quot; Kim shrugged.

&quot;What, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s hard.&quot;

&quot;Ohh, thank you!!!&quot; Miron rushed at Kim and flung his arms around the 
poor boy, squeezing first in thanks, then with a slight, warm feeling of 
lust. Mmm, so soft...

&quot;Uh, n-no problem,&quot; he stuttered, prying Miron off. Those who knew Miron 
knew he was a thousand times happier already&#151;and not just for the 
offer&#151;and those who did not were, suffice to say, better for the 
experience.

.........

Lino Katajisto had Kit on the mind, but that could wait for another day: 
he needed to train his team, or rather, retrain. Soccer season oddly 
fell during April that year (it was usually an autumn sport and the 
change mystified Lino), and since he had already gone through the 
session with everyone around September, he was loathe to do it again&#151;but 
winter had dulled their skills and made their joints rusty. It was back 
to the old drawing board, then&#151;what else could he do?

Lino&#39;s semi-secret lover Kit wanted to be more than just a good goalie 
and a good boyfriend to Lino; he wanted to be a good student as well, to 
absorb as much of Douglass as he could before graduation so he&#39;d come 
out of the experience a much wiser man. He had wasted the first four 
years (this was his fifth since he was held back), and nearly all of 
this one, and was afraid the rest of the year was going by too fast for 
him. Playing soccer was not his long-term goal, nor was being a 
musician, although admittedly he was good at that. Parkin didn&#39;t know 
what he wanted to do with his life, but he figured he had plenty of 
years to find out. After all, he was turning nineteen soon.

The rest of the soccer team made poor Kit look scrawny and out of place, 
but they loved him like a brother and supported him, since he was the 
weakest overall. One of their good players would be missing for the rest 
of the season because of the terrible testicular cancer treatments he 
was undergoing, and another would be out of commission due to a 
self-inflicted injury (Lino had pulled Xavier off to the side and spoke 
to him, but the matter had already been resolved and everything was 
cool). That left the team straggling, but there were plenty of boys in 
reserve.

Brothers Eric and Alistair Fox volunteered to make up for Xavier, and 
between the two of them they could easily pass it off. After all, they 
were both martial artists, even the meek Eric, and they could get pretty 
nasty on the field, although the older Alistair was clearly the more 
aggressive Fox out there. It was Eric&#39;s best friend Ross who had the 
cancer; Eric was a brick and more to poor Mr. McKeough during this 
painful crisis.

&quot;It makes me sad seeing those two together,&quot; Alistair said as he and his 
boyfriend showered together (it was actually Oliver&#39;s idea, which was 
surprising). He turned around and asked, &quot;You know why?&quot;

&quot;I can sure guess,&quot; said Oliver Johnson calmly. &quot;They were an item once, 
right? And before that, very close friends. Eric was the gay one, and 
Ross was not. They gravitated when Ross&#39; girlfriend was killed in Iraq, 
and they came even closer when Ross found out he had cancer in his, 
um...family jewels. It flared, it fizzled, and lots of nonsense happened 
since. It breaks the heart to see Eric pining over such an unrequited 
love.&quot;

&quot;It breaks my heart more,&quot; murmured Alistair, turning around so he could 
wash his boyfriend&#39;s chest. &quot;They were so...perfect for each other. They 
connected in ways I could never understand.&quot; Oliver didn&#39;t know that 
Alistair once had a small fling with his younger brother, but it 
wouldn&#39;t have changed their relationship anyway. After all, he had once 
made love to a man that was like a brother to him, so who was he to 
judge?

&quot;By the way,&quot; he asked, &quot;is the cancer treatable?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the only good thing in this mess. They found it early, and Ross 
has been going through some chemo. Looks fucking sexy without his hair, 
I must admit.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so should I go bald?&quot;

&quot;Only if ya want to!&quot; squealed Fox, draping his arms over the 
dark-skinned man.

Emil McGowen didn&#39;t feel like having class that day (he just wanted to 
HURRY UP and go on his date with Harry already), so he showed an 
astronomy video he liked, featuring the voice of Patrick &quot;Picard&quot; 
Stuart. He knew it was lazy of him, but even he, the loveable eccentric 
scientist, had to take a day off now and then. Even in the darkness, he 
could see the boredom on some students&#39; faces (Oliver looked that way 
all the time, for the record). Augustus and Victor were chatting 
quietly, Xavier was twiddling his thumbs, Zane was doodling more designs 
for his clothes, Arish and Blake were more into each other than the 
film...

&quot;I honestly can&#39;t wait till&#39; next year,&quot; sighed McGowen to himself. &quot;I&#39;m 
just about sick of these kids.&quot; It was hard to be sick of McGowen 
himself (unless one were Dr. Andrews), or of his class, but that was the 
Catch-22. Ronnie Marcos suppressed a yawn and tried to remain focused. 
He already knew plenty about the solar system, but he never passed up 
the opportunity to watch a film. Now if only his boyfriend were here, 
then things would get interesting!

Alexander... Ronnie sighed. He hated it when they fought&#151;he cherished 
Alex so much&#151;and already his pain was clearing his head. Why did they 
ever, ever fight at all&#151;over some silly belief or system? Was it just 
tempers that had flared, or bad timing, or loss? He knew he needed Alex 
in his arms, now, and yearned for class to be over so he could run up, 
apologize, and smother the dear man with kisses. He had been wrong, and 
he was ready to admit it, if only to be around him again...

&quot;Man,&quot; sighed Rocky Knox, &quot;this is so dull!&quot;

&quot;Make the most of it, Rox,&quot; whispered Zane, who was sitting beside him. 
He gave the older man a smile and added, &quot;Soon we&#39;ll be out of this 
prison and in the real world. Scary, no? You and I, man, seniors 
already! Does it feel like it&#39;s been four years?&quot;

&quot;More like...four thousand. Every one more awful than the last.&quot;

&quot;Aw, why do ya say that?&quot; said Klein with a smile. &quot;I had some fun! I 
like it here in ole Freddy Douglas. Suffice to say, better here than 
with Petrov, right?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s your rival; you know him better than I do.&quot; Zane Klein smiled, and 
wished he could wink at Virockene Knox, just to fluster the poor boy&#151;but 
Rocky&#39;s eyes were on the film, and nothing save a poke in the back would 
tear them off.

But even this did nothing but earn Zane a little slap on the arm. 
Phooey.

.........

Evan Rohani wondered if there would ever come a time when he could 
double-date with Rocky. He had been on one with Kama and Yuga, but they 
weren&#39;t nearly as close to him as Rocky Knox, and they were both 
surprisingly quiet in each other&#39;s company. Maybe it was because Kama, 
who had one kind of a reputation, and Yuga, who had another, could 
understand each other very well and didn&#39;t need to talk. Either that, or 
they were just shy, or worse, they simply had nothing to say.

Evan sat next to Rocky during lunch, and witnessed the older man give a 
rare smile. Rocky smiled so infrequently these days! Evan knew it was 
more than just seriousness directing the man&#39;s life; Rocky had a deep, 
secret, inner pain that few could understand. He felt out of place in 
the world, which was quite believable since he had two fathers. Being 
left without a motherly figure in his life must&#39;ve done some kind of 
damage to his system, and being thrust into this pit of testosterone 
certainly didn&#39;t make things any better. The boy needed a girlfriend, 
and Evan was determined to find one.

&quot;Don&#39;t bother,&quot; sighed Rocky, stirring his food around. &quot;It&#39;s not like 
anyone would want to be with me anyway.&quot;

&quot;Natalie seems to like you.&quot;

&quot;Natalie is your girlfriend, Ev,&quot; pointed Knox. &quot;I mean, she&#39;s a sweet 
woman, yeah, but unless she has a sister or something, I&#39;m out of luck.&quot;

&quot;My point was that there&#39;s one girl you know of out there that likes 
you.&quot;

&quot;Who is considerably taken by my friend&#151;yes, I know that.&quot; Evan frowned. 
From the corner of his eye, he could see, of all things, Miron and Kim 
sitting together. Now there was probably no way of that realistically 
happening, but if she knew Douglass, then she knew that Mr. Madsen was 
probably behind all of it. Well, good. Poor Kim needed some friends, 
even if they did pick on him and admire him from afar.

&quot;Let&#39;s forget about it,&quot; sighed Knox; &quot;it only makes me more miserable. 
I&#39;d much rather focus on graduation.&quot;

&quot;Oh, me too. But it&#39;s bound to be different for you; you&#39;ve been here 
longer than I have, man. You&#39;re probably gonna miss this place, and I 
barely know it.&quot;

&quot;Miss it?&quot; he said with a laugh. &quot;Ev, are you kidding me? I&#39;ll turn 
right around and never look back! Frankly, I can&#39;t wait for summer 
vacation. I already have a good job lined up, and I stress the word 
good. At least it&#39;s better than my current job.&quot;

&quot;Hey, no job is better than my job,&quot; remarked Rohani, smiling sadly. 
Both guys made a face and vowed once again to never talk about it. Then, 
&quot;Hey Rocky?&quot;

&quot;Hey Ev.&quot;

&quot;Um...would you...I mean...if I offered, and she agreed, would you date 
Natalie?&quot;

&quot;HUH??&quot;

&quot;Not really; I mean, just to see what it&#39;s like. It&#39;s not going to be 
like a &#145;date&#39; date. Just...go out and have some fun.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So I&#39;m taking Mia Wallace out for a good time, am I?&quot; Evan gave his 
friend a puzzled look, and Rocky smiled. &quot;Pulp Fiction reference. You 
know? ...Never mind. I&#39;m touched, but I just couldn&#39;t do that, not to my 
friend&#39;s girlfriend. It&#39;s not right.&quot;

&quot;All right, no problem. I just thought it was a good idea.&quot;

.........

Harry Johansson felt an awful lot like Simon Cowell as he sat behind a 
desk (his own aegis shield, in a sense) and listened, or sometimes 
endured, voice after voice. The school was going to have a small chorus 
sing for graduation, and Harry knew he&#39;d need some good vocalists. So 
far, most of the guys auditioning didn&#39;t quite sound up to par, and only 
a few were sufficient. One frankly made Harry want to stab his ears so 
that the blood would clot enough to thicken, providing an excellent 
muffler (it was Jon Lu).

Now Evan Rohani was a shoe-in, and he also wanted Ronnie Marcos and the 
sweet Irish twang of Gabriel O&#39;Shannon, but these were the only ones 
accepted so far. Harry went over the list of applicants several times, 
and jumped suddenly when he felt two hands grab his shoulders and 
squeeze. He turned around and hissed as he saw his friends and 
coworkers, Bo Cerio and Abbot Keeping smiling down at him.

&quot;Sheesh, don&#39;t sneak up on me like that!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Bo with a chuckle, &quot;we didn&#39;t realize you were so deeply 
enthralled with your work. Still trying to fix the kinks?&quot;

&quot;That and then some,&quot; sighed Harry, rubbing his temples. He pointed to 
two chairs and asked the two men to sit, but they declined. &quot;What? Don&#39;t 
tell me you came here just to startle me!&quot;

&quot;No, to recommend other artists,&quot; said Abbot. &quot;We know how hard you&#39;re 
working, Harry Jo, so we thought we&#39;d pitch in and ask around. Have you 
tried Jean Bautista?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t aware that he sang.&quot;

&quot;Oh, he can sing,&quot; said Keeping with a smile. &quot;Let&#39;s see... Ray Zanders 
would do well.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m having him in the orchestra, at least until the big moment.&quot;

&quot;What about Victor Grissom? He&#39;s got talent.&quot;

&quot;Look, I appreciate this, but since I&#39;m the musical coordinator around 
here, and the instructor, I think I know what I&#39;m doing&#151;not to sound 
harsh, but no thanks.&quot;

&quot;You made a poor attempt,&quot; moaned Bo, clutching his heart. &quot;Your words 
penetrate my breast and shake me to my spine.&quot;

&quot;Ah, grow up. The only thing that penetrates you is&#151;&quot;

&quot;I,&quot; sang Abbot, knowing the conversation had worn out its welcome, 
&quot;think it&#39;s time for us to go. Harry, if you want your hairs to turn 
gray over this, be my guest. We just wanted to help. Come, Beauregard, 
and leave this tone-deaf cabbage to his work.&quot;

&quot;Chrono Trigger!&quot; exclaimed Cerio. Both men gave him an understandably 
puzzled look.

Bernard Marbel didn&#39;t know what to do. One foreign language teacher was 
quitting, and the other was being obstinate. If only Andru Torvald would 
stay, then everything would work out so much better! Without his veteran 
experience, Samuel O&#39;Brien would have no support in his new class, and 
would flounder with the work load before September. He certainly 
couldn&#39;t teach any other language, and if he was left high and dry, he 
was probably better off looking for another job. This was one of 
Bernard&#39;s methods of negotiation, but Andru wouldn&#39;t hear it.

&quot;I am sorry for you, Sammy,&quot; he said to the rotund man, &quot;but I can&#39;t 
stay here. There are just too many bad memories.&quot;

&quot;Bad memories?!&quot; he bleated. &quot;What the hell kind of excuse is that? 
Forget about those memories; what about me? I&#39;ll be handed my 
resignation papers if you go!&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t happen,&quot; said Bernard, who still fought night and day to 
keep his old friend afloat. &quot;Sam, I promise you, I&#39;ll do whatever it 
takes to keep your job. I owe you that much at least.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re damn right,&quot; he muttered. Marbel wasn&#39;t afraid to show his 
anxious, worrisome face, at least not around close friends and 
coworkers. It softened Samuel&#39;s heart, and with a sigh he apologized. 
&quot;No, you&#39;ve done enough. If I&#39;m fired, I&#39;m fired. There are plenty of 
colleges willing to take a guy like me in, and plenty of students who 
want a Latin class. I just...never ran into any.&quot;

&quot;I can help with that,&quot; said Marbel. He placed his hand on the younger 
man&#39;s shoulder and smiled; Samuel grinned and gave a cheerful shrug.

&quot;Bernie,&quot; he grumbled, &quot;you&#39;re going through a lot of trouble for this 
old worn-out instructor, and if I was a smarter man, I&#39;d&#39;ve realized how 
good I have it, with a pal like you. Sad to say that I&#39;m not. Andy,&quot; he 
said, looking at Torvald, &quot;you go and do what you need to do. I figure 
I&#39;m messed up no matter where I go, and well...we both may be wanting 
this change of scenery. Don&#39;t know why I&#39;m surrendering like this,&quot; he 
added with a cough. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s senility already, or the fact that I&#39;m 
tired of fightin&#39; this. Eh...I dunno. I&#39;m old and weary. If any o&#39; you 
lunkheads need me, I&#39;ll be in the teacher&#39;s lounge.&quot; He left with 
bravado; Marbel and Torvald didn&#39;t know what to make of this, but 
reasoned that if O&#39;Brien had at last accepted his fate, then things 
should be easier to bear in the future.

Janus Keys looked over his charges and smiled&#151;another day, another 
project. What was everyone doing now? Ronnie Marcos was probably 
constructing something blue to fit his mood&#151;but wait, Alexander Blair 
was approaching him. They were sitting together and talking liked they 
used to! Well, that was good; Keys loved young Mr. Blair like a son, and 
soon, if things went well, that bond would be solidified further. Most 
schools discouraged such parent-teacher relationships, but this was a 
definite exception. After all, Alex needed a father figure, and who 
better to fill that role than a man who had always wanted to sire a son?

Of course, Gabriel O&#39;Shannon and Lilo Nachtheim worked together. They 
had been oddly distant from each other for awhile there, but the way 
they carried on and smiled, they seemed back together again, all loving 
and sweet like before. That was good news. And Heero was with Yancy 
again as well, though the other boy wasn&#39;t in any of Keys&#39; classes this 
year. Everyone seemed bonded (or re-bonded) with somebody, and Janus 
couldn&#39;t help but think that Spring Break had something to do with it. A 
week away from all this drama did wonders.

But just as many people had problems to sort out. Mickey Washim, his 
star sketcher, had issues with Namae Nakatori that Janus just didn&#39;t 
want to get into, and poor Larry Kwong always seemed to have some 
problem or another. Larry Kwong... Janus heaved a sigh and felt sorry 
for the young boy. He was like a rock when it came to friendships&#151;he 
stuck by his pal Ivan Tran when everyone else would&#39;ve abandoned the 
wild man, and even helped set him up with Ancel Yi&#151;but when it came to 
his own relationships, he floundered. Janus didn&#39;t even know if he was 
still seeing Trista or not, but odds were that the two were in some kind 
of feud. He decided to pull Larry aside and have a private chat. Ancel 
said goodbye to his friend and left to see Ivan; Larry frowned and 
crossed his arms once the two were alone.

&quot;I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve been very distant recently, Larry,&quot; said Keys. &quot;Is 
something the matter? Is it Ivan, or your girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;No...more like a combination of things,&quot; he sighed. &quot;Ivan&#39;s such a gay 
butthead, and he keeps on telling me that he&#39;ll pay me back for all this 
trouble I&#39;m going through for him, but I&#39;m not seeing anything. 
And...yeah, Trisat&#39;s a handful. I seriously think she&#39;s cheating on me 
now.&quot;

&quot;You two seemed inseparable from the start.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, not all couples look like they were drawn from a fairy 
tale. We have problems.&quot; He stopped himself suddenly, cast his face 
down, and dug his hands in his pockets. &quot;I&#39;m a desperate man, Mr. Keys. 
I had sex with Trista two nights ago because I thought it would seal our 
relationship together, once and for all. Neither one of us are virgins 
anymore because of it. I promised myself I wouldn&#39;t do that until I was 
married, but...I&#39;m scared to lose her. I don&#39;t necessarily hate her, 
just the things she does.&quot;

&quot;...Do you think she&#39;s ever sorry for them?&quot; asked the older man.

&quot;Oh, she says she is, but lately I&#39;ve really started to wonder! ...I 
know she does mean well sometimes,&quot; he added quietly, &quot;but it&#39;s 
difficult to trust a person who is no longer reliable.&quot; Janus Keys 
nodded, a bit empathetically, but the two were separated from their 
conversation by the tardy bell. Larry made a face and turned pale. 
&quot;Shoot, I&#39;m late.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay; I&#39;ll give you a note excusing your tardiness. Even Madsen 
won&#39;t have anything to say if he sees one of my papers.&quot; Larry smiled 
weakly and looked at his teacher&#39;s face.

&quot;Why, do you have him whipped or something?&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s just say that he respects my authority in this school,&quot; said Keys 
with a smirk. &quot;And though I may not look it, I can become even scarier 
than him if I have to. Just a sec.&quot; Larry kept his smile as he watched 
Keys write up a note, but on the inside he was far from happy. Every day 
seemed to have too many problems and never enough solutions; it was 
always one step forward and two steps back; he seemed trapped between a 
rock and a hard place, et cetera.

Chef Soma Verela figured it was about time he forgave Mr. Marbel for 
lying to him, and to also forgive Dr. Andrews for breaking his heart. He 
confronted both his past loves one at a time; the former was gracious, 
and glad to have the whole matter now officially behind him, plus he was 
subsequently thrilled to hear of soma&#39;s relationship with Mr. Post. The 
latter, however, was his usual frosty self, and except for a faint smile 
and a &quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; Soma didn&#39;t get much out of Jean-Jacques Andrews. 
Oh well.

&quot;Let em&#39; stew in his own juices,&quot; recommended Gabriel O&#39;Shannon, one of 
the students Soma freely called a friend. &quot;That dam&#39; doctor has broken 
too many hearts. You were a saint to forgive him; if all was right, he 
shoulda forgiven you! I vow to you,&quot; he pointed, &quot;one o&#39; these days, 
he&#39;ll get what&#39;s comin&#39; to him, mark my words.&quot;

&quot;I think he already has,&quot; murmured Soma faintly. &quot;But...he did not 
deserve it back then. That&#39;s why I think he&#39;s so cold; it&#39;s because he 
got his comeuppance prematurely.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like Mr. McGowen isn&#39;t sorry or nothin&#39;,&quot; muttered O&#39;Shannon, 
chewing on his food. A pause, for digestion&#151;&quot;Lord knows he&#39;s gone down 
on his knees enough times. If the doc were a better man, he&#39;s forgive 
and forget, know what I mean? That&#39;s the sad thing about people, though: 
they want their own wrongs to be forgiven, but they can&#39;t abide to 
forgivin&#39; others. Saints be praised...&quot; The two empathetic men nodded in 
agreement, and went about a quiet meal until the sweet albino Lilo 
Nachtheim came around, greeting first his Irish lover and second his 
good friend the school cook.

&quot;And people say Elmer and I are sickening,&quot; chuckled Soma as she watched 
them rub noses. The two lovebirds groused at her and said that he was 
just jealous.

Kama Nanahara felt a lot better after confronting his one time object of 
love/hate, Arish Krishnan, and glibly remarked that he had now probably 
apologized to the poor guy at least a million times. Arish said to not 
worry about it, all was forgiven, and besides, they all seemed to be 
happy (after all, he was with his sweet soccer star Blake again!). Kama 
wasn&#39;t so sure. He had agreed to go out on a date with Yuga Kogure, but 
he wasn&#39;t so sure.

&quot;Why not?&quot; said Blake. &quot;The two of you would look so freaking adorable! 
And you&#39;re half-Japanese, aren&#39;t you? So you&#39;d be able to relate to him 
better than any of us guys. Besides, who else but a wild Hawaiian 
thrasher like you could stand to be around that wacky samurai wannabe 
for more than an hour? You two would fit like a key and a lock.&quot;

&quot;How well you judge me,&quot; growled Kama. He hated it when people told him 
his own life story&#151;after all, what did they know?&#151;but for once, somebody 
was right on the mark. Kama did relate to Yuga better than anyone, and 
he actually liked those random recitations of bushido pride and honor 
Kogure was infamous for. That they had something of a past together 
might have helped push things along, but Kama wasn&#39;t so sure. He wanted 
to get the whole story from Yuga, maybe without the samurai-style 
interruptions.

&quot;...It would be nice to be in love with somebody that wasn&#39;t afraid of 
me,&quot; he muttered later. &quot;God, I hate my rep these days. Course, it&#39;s 
nobody&#39;s fault but my own.&quot;

&quot;Times have changed,&quot; said Arish, taking his hand. &quot;You&#39;ve become a 
better person&#151;we all have. And you had a darn good excuse for acting the 
way you did. I&#39;m just glad that the three of us can be friends without 
too much conflict.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so are Kama and I buddies now?&quot; said Blake with a smile. Arish 
shrugged.

&quot;Well, you do seem to get along, and he would look good on the soccer 
team.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not gonna ogle him are you?&quot; teased Blake, poking his boyfriend 
in the ribs. Arish laughed and slapped him away; Kama watched with mild 
interest. Boys! Honestly...

.........

Ray Lance Zanders remembered that once upon a time, he had been the 
awkward object of affection for all the boys in Douglass. He couldn&#39;t 
help it if he was a feminine-looking pretty boy&#151;what Mr. Keeping called 
a &quot;bishonen&quot;&#151;he just happened to have the right figure, the right length 
of hair, the right clothes, and the right attitude. He honestly could&#39;ve 
had any woman (or man) he wanted, and either gender would flock to 
attend to his every beck and call. He ended up choosing the spunky, 
blond, puckish Jon Lu, and though he had to suffer an eviction from his 
own home for it, the rewards were well worth it.

&quot;I just want you to know,&quot; he said softly, staring deep into Jon&#39;s 
everlasting blue eyes, &quot;that I love you, and I love you more ever time 
the pulse of my heart thrums through my body.&quot;

&quot;Aww! That&#39;s so sweet!&quot; squealed Jon. Lucky for Ray, Jon was crazy about 
him, though at first he had been a defiant heterosexual who had a thing 
for feminine people. Their journey together was itself a strange tale, 
and currently it was in that one particular chapter where they held each 
other, soft and naked, underneath their bed covers as they made sweet 
love.

&quot;Hey Ray?&quot;

&quot;Mmn.&quot; Eleven thirty-eight; they had been engaged in sex for nearly half 
an hour, on and off. This was the calm after the storm, so to speak.

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking.&quot;

&quot;...Oh? You know, smart blond boys are really sexy, and hard to come 
by.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; giggled Jon, slapping his boyfriend&#39;s bare chest, &quot;and let me 
finish. I was just thinking about alternate realities again.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Been playing Chrono Cross? Staring at poor Glenn, Karsh, and 
Guile?&quot;

&quot;Be quiet!&quot; he squeaked. &quot;I was saying, Mr. Interruption, that I was 
just wondering if there are other versions of us out there.&quot;

&quot;Oh, like what?&quot;

&quot;Like...you know how Douglass is a school for guys, right? Well do you 
suppose that somewhere out there, there&#39;s a school for girls? And not 
just that, but most all the girls in that school are gay, or bisexual, 
like the guys are here? I know it sounds crazy, but it&#39;s been on my mind 
for awhile and I can&#39;t get it out.&quot;

&quot;...An all-girls school,&quot; murmured Ray, unleashing a yawn. He shrugged 
and smiled at his lover, saying, &quot;I guess...anything&#39;s possible.&quot;</pre>
