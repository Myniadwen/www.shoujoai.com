<a href="../original/hartmind-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>The weekend of Sam&#39;s birthday come around much quicker then any of the 
girls were prepared for. Unlike the past year which Sam&#39;s birthday 
landed on a Saturday this year it fell on a Sunday, which worked out 
perfectly for their plans. They arranged to have a sleepover at Beth&#39;s 
place Saturday night, much to Diana&#39;s disappointment, so they could go 
over their plans with Jasmine one last time and head out first thing 
Sunday morning to stop the madness that was about to happen. 

&quot;Tomorrow is the day girls, you sure you are ready to go through with 
this?&quot; Jasmine nervously. 

The three girls nodded confidently. They spent much of the night talking 
over school and movies, while trying to not think about what it was they 
were planning to do first thing in the morning. Each of them harbouring 
fears of what might happen if they made one wrong calculation. They all 
knew the risks they were taking and were prepared as they would ever be 
to do what it took to save the lives of Star and her mother. 

The night was the longest in their lives as they lay in sleeping bags on 
the living room floor. They set the alarms for the crack of dawn knowing 
that Star would be leaving extremely early in order to attempt a visit 
with Sam at the hospital. None of them got much sleep that night as they 
worried over the possibilities of the upcoming day. None more then Sam, 
who found herself unable to sleep and finally went to the balcony to get 
some air, shortly after she was accompanied by Jasmine, who offered the 
girl a cup of hot chocolate. The nights had gotten cool quickly and she 
accepted the drink gratefully. 

&quot;You going to be alright?&quot; Jasmine inquired seriously as she gazed out 
over the cityscape. 

Sam looked down at her mug and let out a long sigh, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m 
so worried about tomorrow and what will happen when Star seems me in 
person.&quot; She said restlessly, &quot;She never got to see what I look like so 
I&#39;m afraid she will be disgusted with me and not want to even be my 
friend.&quot; 

Jasmine turned and lightly placed a hand under the girl&#39;s chin, studying 
the girl&#39;s features, &quot;You&#39;re right, you are a little demon aren&#39;t you?&quot; 
She kidded with the child only to have Sam pull back irately and stare 
out at the stars, brooding. Jasmine stepped up behind the girl and 
hugged her in a way that only a mother could, &quot;You are beautiful.&quot; She 
insisted softly, &quot;If I had a second daughter I would like her to be like 
you.&quot; 

Sam lowered her head in shame, &quot;I&#39;m not beautiful.&quot; She stated 
miserably, &quot;I&#39;m so plain I can&#39;t stand it. Not even my own mother wanted 
me.&quot; Tears began to roll down her soft cheeks, &quot;She gave up any chance 
of seeing me, she didn&#39;t even fight with the courts about it, she just 
let me go without even looking back.&quot; She shook with a sob. 

Jasmine tightened her hug, &quot;She doesn&#39;t realize how lucky she was to 
have a child like you. I think you are the best thing that ever happened 
to this family.&quot; She glanced over her shoulder at her daughter as she 
curled up with Trisha, softly sleeping, &quot;You have no idea how much 
happiness you bring to people.&quot; 

Sam followed the woman&#39;s gaze and smiled at her friends, &quot;I had nothing 
to do with them. They found each other.&quot; She said sheepishly. 

Jasmine shook her head as she turned to look upon the girl again, &quot;You 
don&#39;t give yourself much credit. If you were not around then neither of 
them would have confronted their issues and come to be together.&quot; She 
let go of the girl and sat upon a plastic garden chair, &quot;You see Bethany 
is a rather troubled child. She doesn&#39;t tell me everything, but I know 
she has gone through a lot, not as a psychic, but as a mother. I could 
see the wounded look in her eyes over the summer before she met you and 
wished that there was some way to mend her broken heart.

&quot;One day she came home all excited. She told me that she met a couple of 
wonderful girls at school and that one of them did not treat her like an 
outcast like so many others did. You see she spent most of her 
elementary and junior high school days alone and I think she started to 
dress that way to conceal the loneliness she was feeling. All she could 
talk about for weeks on end was this girl who talked to her like she was 
one of her gang, like a real friend.&quot; She looked up at the girl with a 
smile upon her face, &quot;That girl is you Samantha. You are the one who 
made her feel welcome and not alone in this world and I thank you from 
the bottom of my heart.&quot; 

A bright blush crossed Sam&#39;s face and she gazed down at her hot 
chocolate, as she nervously stirred, &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything special.&quot; She 
stated shyly, &quot;I was just happy that someone wanted to be part of my 
little group of friends. I should be the one thanking her for being 
there when I needed her. If it wasn&#39;t for her, and Trish, I don&#39;t think 
I would have made it through the year.&quot; 

Jasmine stood and smiled down at the girl, &quot;That is what true friends 
are for.&quot; She stated firmly, &quot;They stick together and help each other 
through everything.&quot; 

Sam returned the smile and frowned, &quot;I hope Star will join our group, I 
have this nagging feeling that I&#39;m going to scare her off and she&#39;ll 
never want to talk to me again.&quot; 

The woman&#39;s smile only broadened, &quot;I think you will be surprised to find 
Star will be more then happy to be friends with a girl like you.&quot; She 
gestured to the balcony door; &quot;It is getting cool out here so why don&#39;t 
we go inside and you try to get some sleep.&quot; 

Sam sipped at her drink a little more, &quot;I don&#39;t think I can sleep.&quot; She 
stated miserably, &quot;I think I want to stay out here a little longer if 
that is alright.&quot; 

Jasmine nodded, &quot;Don&#39;t stay out too long, you are going to need your 
rest for tomorrow.&quot; 

Sam returned the nod, &quot;I&#39;ll come in in a bit.&quot; She agreed. 

Jasmine yawned, &quot;Well, I&#39;m off to bed myself. You have a good night 
dear.&quot; 

&quot;Night.&quot; Sam said and then turned to look over the city again. Somewhere 
out there Star was sleeping, she glanced down at the watch upon her 
wrist to see it was two in the morning and recalled that was the time in 
which she awoke from her coma, so that meant that Star was sitting up in 
her room talking to her right now. Her eyes scanned the many lights 
below, hoping to find Star&#39;s window amongst them. Her mind played over 
that night&#39;s conversation clearer then ever before and she smiled at the 
thought of the girl. Star was really excited to be able to meet Sam in 
the morning so maybe, just maybe, Star will be happy to see her in the 
morning after all. Finishing off her drink she moved back into the 
apartment, closing the balcony door behind her, and crawled into 
awaiting sleeping bed, drifting into a fit filled sleep.
