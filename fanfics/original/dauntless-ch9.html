<p>“The Real Voyage Begins at Last!  Huh?”</p>
<p>            Chandra  rolled over in bed hoping that Eve was ready for more loving, but she  woke up to an empty bed, cold and desolate and very unfamiliar.   Usually those who fell under Chandra’s spell were only too happy to  stick around, sometimes desperately clinging to her for more, more,  more…and she always delivered; that was her job.  But discovering that  her latest lover had abandoned her came as a complete shock, and she  laid there trying to reason why this would happen.  Eve had wanted and  needed her, right?  She had accepted Chandra’s embraces and returned  them in kind, burning with a fury she had rarely seen, even in the most  amorous women.  Certainly she couldn’t be feeling guilty, and it didn’t  seem like she had second thoughts either.  There was only one way to  solve this problem, and that was by getting out of the bed they had  shared.  She wanted to explore the ship in the nude, as was her custom,  but something told her to get dressed—an impulse she never usually  obeyed.  Chandra put her clothes on and went to look for Eve.</p>
<p>            The <em>Dauntless</em> seemed dead to her now.  It had landed in the Finelo spaceport  according to Miracle’s proposed schedule, and as Chandra realized they  were now at the end of their journey, the crew was more than likely in  the large community room where Miracle had first appeared—and thus, Eve  might be there too.  Oh, so that’s where she went!  She just wanted to  get paid and be on her way.  But did that mean she was tired of  Chandra, or did she intend to bring her along?  Chandra sincerely hoped  it was the latter, and raced through the quiet halls.  Normally the  ship would be pulsing with beautiful women just waiting for her tender  care, but now it resembled just another vessel, cold and sterile and  lifeless.  Everyone was in the room, even the enigmatic mastermind of  the voyage, though now Miracle resembled a solid black orb, so smooth  and clear that the blackness was now purity itself; white seemed almost  evil now.</p>
<p>            Chandra is here, Amy, spoke the orb, its  voice predictably mechanical.  The entire crew has made it.  We must  begin the farewell ceremony.</p>
<p>            “Yes, thank you.  Well  everyone,” said the mousy brunette in a clear, nostalgic voice, “this  is the end of the road.  You have successfully recovered the treasure  Dr. Miracle has been seeking, and now, no doubt, you want your money.   We’re more than happy to deliver it to you—after all, you have earned  it all.  Time and again you have proven yourselves worthy of the title  ‘Dauntless’, but now I’m sad to say that the journey is over.  Please,  take your compensation, and peace be with you.”</p>
<p>            All  this time, the crew had wondered just how they were going to be paid.   With fifty-seven women onboard and a proposed 30,000 gold for each  person, that would mean that Dr. Miracle would have to pull one  million, seven-hundred ten-thousand (1,710,000) units of gold from  somewhere, and unless the doctor was very rich or had a hidden stash…   But just as soon as this question rested on the minds of the crew, the  black orb spewed forth a cloudy, bluish haze, its smell like orchid and  lilac, and out of this fog came 30,000 units of gold for each woman,  each pile labeled accordingly.  Mink hoarded two piles as Vimmy yawned  carelessly; Rebecca and Kate savored their payment with a hunger that  only the poor know of.  So much for the journey, then.</p>
<p>             A handful of women were already leaving with their reward, their hopes  high and their prospects good, but a few stayed behind, brooding in  their questions.  Amy stared at them and asked them what the problem  was, and Kate—bashful despite her appearance—stepped forth and  questioned the two very generous people.</p>
<p>            “I’m  grateful…we all are…but I was under the impression that this voyage  would last for a long time.  I figured we’ve have to travel around the  entire galaxy to look for this treasure.  But now we already found it,  and I was just wondering…is that all there is?”</p>
<p>            “Um, yes,” Amy answered, “Miracle and I were after the Tome of Treasures.  We have it now, so…”</p>
<p>“What  a load of shit!” Lil groused, kicking the ground.  “We came all this  way and barely spent a week here!  If that’s not a rip-off, I don’t  know what is!”</p>
<p>Are you dissatisfied with your pay? boomed the orb.</p>
<p>“No,  wait,” Amy said, interrupting her master.  “I have not been completely  specific.  Originally I said you could come and go as you pleased; that  freedom still applies to everyone here.  I’m sorry if you got the wrong  idea; we’re merely allowing anyone that wants to leave the chance to.   Um—excuse me, everyone?  If you want to leave the ship, you can, but if  you want to stay, you may.  Lyara, make sure everyone hears that, all  right?”</p>
<p>“So we don’t have to leave?”  A thrilling hope surged in  the hearts of more than a few women there.  Plenty had come for the  treasures, but more were there for the fun and adventure, or to escape  their troubled pasts.  Having the option of staying gave them hope, but  even then, several more left.</p>
<p>“I really don’t want to,” Naja  muttered, “but if it’s a choice between here and home, I’ll stay here.   But you and that bowling ball better keep me busy!  The time of an  Elshyrin is very precious; I won’t have you wasting it!”</p>
<p>“Not at all!” Amy assured her.  Chandra clapped her hands and almost sang.</p>
<p>“Then I’m staying!  I won’t abandon all these gorgeous women!”</p>
<p>“I  guess that means I’ll leave,” Herut stated.  Shana grabbed her arm  gently and penetrated into her heart with soft glowing eyes; there was  love and innocence radiating from her that rendered all words  meaningless.  Herut only had one reason for leaving, but her reasons  for staying seemed to be stronger.  She sighed; “Or I could just keep  avoiding the slut.”</p>
<p>“Oh piss off, kid!”</p>
<p>“Now-now,” Amy  giggled, wobbling slightly on her cane.  “Everyone is entitled to their  freedom.  We’ll let those who want to leave, while the rest can stay as  long as they choose.  And just for a record, Dr. Miracle and I have an  announcement for those that are staying.”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>             It didn’t even take half an hour for the crew to declare its intentions  and slim itself down to size.  Of the initial fifty-seven women, only  twenty-two remained—thirty-five decided to call it quits and move on to  other things.  There were no hard feelings and little love lost between  the two groups—in fact, more than one woman was glad to see her former  comrade leave.  Once the rest of the crew was situated, Amy invited  them back into the gathering room, only this time, Miracle was nowhere  to be found.  She was now almost completely independent of her cane,  only pressing the occasional weight against it.  Only Fuuka and a  handful of others showed concern; the rest were wondering what this big  announcement could be.</p>
<p>            “It seems we have more room  now,” Amy observed with a smile.  “Well, twenty-two brave women out of  fifty-seven left!  I feel quite honored, and I’m sure that my master  feels the same.  No doubt you’re wondering why I called you all here,  or why I emphasized your personal freedom.  You have chosen to stay  with this ship even though your mission is complete, and for that great  loyalty, you’ll be rewarded with some very interesting information.”</p>
<p>             She took a breath and was prepared to speak, but before she could,  Lyara stepped forth, pointed at her, and said, “You’re Dr. Miracle,  aren’t you?”  The crew was petrified momentarily as this accusation was  thrown in the air, and their reaction was intensified as Amy blushed,  smiled sheepishly, and admitted it.</p>
<p>            “Yes,” she  whispered, “I’m Dr. Miracle—Amy Blithe Miracle, doctor of theology and  literature.”  She even pulled out her driver’s license and degree, and  they each confirmed Lyara’s suspicions.  The unassuming, quiet, cheery  Amy, pigtailed and bespectacled, wobbling around with one bad leg, had  in fact been masquerading all along, and now the ruse was over, the jig  was up, and the truth was liberating everyone.</p>
<p>            “How did you know?” Riene whispered.</p>
<p>            “More importantly, what was the point of this stupid charade?” Naja snorted.</p>
<p>             “And if you’re Dr. Miracle, what the hell was that…thing?!” Kyrie  squealed.  Amy Miracle tittered, sat down on the nearest couch (her  foot was starting to throb), and wiped her brow.</p>
<p>            “Now-now, I’ll explain everything.  First of all, Lyara, how <em>did</em> you know?”</p>
<p>             “I can just read emotions very well,” she answered.  “I couldn’t get a  good lock on you for a long time—you kept us quite busy—but when I did  get the chance, I sensed feelings of secrecy, doubt, suspicion, glee,  and even some remorse.  You were definitely hiding something…  I really  just guessed, but it seems my guess was right.”</p>
<p>             “Seems so!” Amy laughed.  “As for the purpose of this illusion, I’m  sure some of you are aware of what curses come with being a celebrity.   In order to successfully complete the retrieval of this sacred Tome, I  had to disguise myself against all possible suspicion.  Needless to  say, with a presence like mine, it wasn’t very difficult.  Nobody would  believe I was <em>the</em> Dr. Miracle unless I had proof.  Even so, I  had some help.  The being you saw pretending to be me is actually a  dear friend of mine who was in on the act.  If you’ll permit me to  introduce you, I think you’ll find she’s quite a lively character.”</p>
<p>             Since this would answer Kyrie’s question, everyone stood patiently as  the fake Dr. Miracle appeared.  The room shuddered, lightning flashed,  and unimaginable fear and beauty permeated the room, just as it did  when the entity first appeared—but now Amy was completely in control of  the situation, and even rebuked the approaching phantasm with her cane.</p>
<p>            <strong>“Who dares summon the all-powerful Mirac—ow!  How dare you strike me, servant!”</strong></p>
<p>            “<em>Doctor</em>, you can drop the act now.  It’s that time.”</p>
<p>            <strong>“Oh, really?</strong><strong>  Sorry—I didn’t know.  Ahem:  brace yourselves, everybody!”</strong></p>
<p>POOF!</p>
<p>             This time the transformation was so quick and anticlimactic that it was  comic.  The Miracle impersonator required nothing more than a cloud of  smoke and a silly noise to appear—and maybe a little thud as she landed  right on her rear end.  Of all the things that could’ve come from that  unnecessary display, none of the women expected to see a girl roughly  their own age and build, vaguely human but as far removed from  humanity’s gene pool as the planets and the stars themselves.  Her skin  was a few shades darker than Chandra’s ochre shade, she had sassy eyes  that darted and cut like knives, regal purple hair lashed in a bouncy  tail, and very exotic clothes that harkened back to the days of Arabian  harems.  Her pointed ears were pierced, as was her belly button, her  eyebrows, and even her nose, and she wore exotic jewelry and smelled  like paradise.</p>
<p>            “Ow,” she wailed, rubbing her sore  bottom as she stood.  “I keep telling myself I’ll watch out for that  landing, but…  Oh, hey, how’s everyone doing?  So is this the crew?   That’s totally neat!  Wait, do people still say neat?  Master Amy, you  should’ve given me more time to prepare!  I should’ve had a speech  planned out and everything!”</p>
<p>            “Calm down, sweetheart,”  Amy laughed.  “I think they’ll like you just the way they are.  My dear  friends, remnants of the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em>, brave souls  gathered together under a single banner, it is my great pleasure to  introduce my dearest friend and servant, the guardian who has been  pretending to be me this whole time.  Please welcome her as one of us.”</p>
<p><strong>Name:  Rachel Ifritah Jinniyah</strong></p>
<p><strong>Species:  Genie (<em>Efriti</em><em> djinni</em>)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Origin:  Deep Heaven</strong></p>
<p><strong>Age:  15,500 (approximate)</strong></p>
<p>            “A <em>genie?!</em>”   Mouths hung open and eyes bulged, and for a very good reason.  Up until  then, the women had all considered themselves educated people, or at  least not gullible enough to believe that fairytale creatures such as  genies existed (of course, elves, dwarves, giants, and evil stepmothers  were all very real).  But this feminine creature was hovering right in  front of them, tendrils of perfume wafting from her head, her eyes  glowing with a truly alien luster.  They had all witnessed the  transformation and could see that this perky, inquisitive entity was  the result, but it was still hard to wrap the mind around.</p>
<p>             There is one error people tend to make concerning genies, and it must  be cleared now (Amy also emphasized this, and what she said more or  less follows this statement).  Genies (Ifrits or Djinn, as they’re  formally called) are not normally benevolent creatures.  Many are  actually quite devilish and sinister, and to meet one would usually  lead to an early and agonizing demise.  They despise creatures with  high intelligence and sometimes go out of their way to inflict strife  on their victims, usually by making Faustian bargains.  It is true,  sometimes, that men and women can master these Ifrits and command them  to grant wishes (usually one wish or a lifetime of wishes), but they  must never be thought of as selfless, humble, servile creatures.  But  in rare occasions, such as the relationship between Amy and this  particular Ifritah, they are benign and trustworthy souls who greatly  respect their masters.  As soon as Amy cleared this up—and as soon as  she emphasized the fact that Rachel was not in the habit of granting  wishes—things could proceed smoothly, even though plenty of women still  stared.</p>
<p>            <em>I’ve felt this power before,</em> Lyara thought to herself as she fixated her gaze.  <em>This  is the same emotional energy I picked up from that ghost I saw.  That  would make sense, then:  what I saw was just another form this Jinniyah  takes.  She must have been guarding Dr. Miracle’s door when I wandered  there…probably guarding the “secret”, more than likely.  Very  interesting…</em></p>
<p>“Now that I have revealed these secrets, it’s  high time I expose the nature of the treasure I hired you all to find.  The Tome of Treasures is the most accurate record of valuable and rare  artifacts in the galaxy. Painstaking research has been put into the  location, appearance, estimated value—and in some cases, the purpose—of  every conceivable treasure since the dawn of civilization. This means  that what we have in our hands is a foolproof, absolute, accurate guide  to every treasure in the Milky Way, including where it can be found,  what it looks like…everything you could think of. Wrap your minds  around that for a moment and you’ll begin to appreciate the security  surrounding this manuscript, why I required so many specialists to  retrieve it, and why only a tiny percentage was allowed to glimpse at  it.”</p>
<p>“It also means we’re in a heap o’ trouble,” Allegra groaned.  “I mean, we stole something that’s prolly worth trillions, wrecked  almost half a planet gettin’ to it, busted up a pile o’ killer robots…”</p>
<p>“If  you’ve got a problem with that, you can leave anytime ya want,” Naja  muttered. Allegra fancied herself too ladylike to argue, so she just  raised her nose and turned her back. Amy just smiled and weathered the  storm.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about the authorities. I’m sharing this gift  with all of you. I barely did anything to earn it; I merely organized  things and selected the people I thought would be the most useful. You  all deserve the credit—therefore, you deserve to use this book however  you please.” Now of all the wild imaginations in that room, Vimmy’s was  perhaps the most intense. Already she was envisioning herself swimming  in precious jewels and priceless artifacts, rich beyond the  comprehension of mortals, perhaps wealthy enough to rival the  Vicegerent himself. Just thinking about it caused her to jump and  vibrate like a big purple doll; her hair suddenly fell off as she  danced, revealing a very naked scalp. Most of the women gawked and  guffawed, but Mink calmly reached down and affixed the wig back onto  her master’s head.</p>
<p>“Don’t be staring now, a bald member of my  society has far more advantages than you can realize, why just the  other day I changed the length and color of my hair, and tomorrow who  knows, I might sport locks spun from pure gold or hair that shimmers  like a clear mirror, or I may choose to wear a rainbow that glows  gloriously as I move, it’s all about fashion and style, that’s why I  don’t understand people who keep their natural hair, it’s much more  liberating to use wigs and go bald, you can change whenever you like,  and we all do it where I come from, but anyway, tell us more about  these treasures, Amy dear!”</p>
<p>“I think you look very pretty,” she replied gaily.</p>
<p>“Don’t encourage her,” Mink warned.</p>
<p>“I  would like this issue to be clarified before we reach any rash  conclusions,” Lyara stated. “What you’re saying is that this crew is  free to look into this book, pick out any treasures we like, and tell  you where to go.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s exactly what I mean.”</p>
<p>“Interesting.”  Her eyebrows raised and the hint of a smile curled on her lips. “Most  interesting indeed. Looks like staying here was a good idea after all.”  But now a great problem arose that would no doubt affect everyone  there. They all had their own ideas about treasures and how to  prioritize them, and an encyclopedia of this magnitude offered so much  freedom that it seemed overwhelming, as large and endless and  intimidating as the universe itself. Even if every crewmember asked the <em>Dauntless</em> to find one treasure, that would be twenty-two  treasures spread across the heavens (twenty-four if Amy and Rachel had  any input). The enormity of the task silenced just about everybody,  except those too giddy to shut up (like Vimmy).</p>
<p>“We can worry about all that later,” Kay said.</p>
<p>“Yeah! Let’s just pick one treasure and go there!” Tee shouted.</p>
<p>“Those that do not feel like going can stay here contemplating our next destination.”</p>
<p>“And those that go will have one hell of a hunt!”</p>
<p>“Sounds  like a plan!” Shana chirped. Of course, now the whole crew had  something new to argue about, so Amy asked Rachel to choose a location  for them. The genie closed her eyes and pointed to a holographic image  at random—and that was designated as the new destination. From such  humble beginnings came the greatest treasure hunt of all time—and the  true start of the voyage of the <em>Dauntless</em>.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Rachel:  Yahoo!  I finally get to do the previews!</p>
<p>Lyara:  How in the world did Amy score a hot babe—I mean, a ditzy weirdo like this?</p>
<p>Mink:  You’re jealous.</p>
<p>Lyara:  No, of course not!  I mean, it’s not as if I want hot genie sex all of a sudden.  No, wait—that came out wrong!!</p>
<p>Mink:  Heh.</p>
<p>Rachel:  Guys, can I please finish the preview?</p>
<p>Mink:  Sure.</p>
<p>Rachel:   Coolsies!  The next chapter begins the true voyage of our courageous  crew!  What sorts of dangers and fortunes await them?  A new enemy  shows up next time in, “Rise of the Jackal:  a rival hunter spells  trouble!”</p>
<p>Vimmy:  I wish I had a genie… (sniffle)</p>
