<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 22 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Alyson crept out of the kitchen; umbrella ready in hand, and down the 
small set of stairs into the study, which comprised of a large fluffy 
sofa, an end table with a small lamp upon it and a long coffee table, 
which she remembered Sofia used for her office table.

The new arrival was clad in long deep brown robes with a rope sash 
around her waist and a hood pulled over her head. Alyson could not see 
who the person was, but she sensed that it must have been one of the 
Sisters of Death for she emitted the same sensation as Gwen and Kai did. 
If this was another Sister, then she hoped this one was as friendly as 
the others or she would have no chance in hell of defending herself 
against the girl. 

Abruptly the figure raised their head to reveal young girl of maybe 
sixteen or older with deep bluish hair that hung loosely over the left 
eye while the right side was kept in a neat tight braid off to the side 
of a long face. Large dark eyes stared out from the shadows of her hood 
at Alyson, studying her up and down, eyeing the umbrella. 

&quot;Where are Sophia and Melissa?&quot; The girl inquired urgently, keeping a 
protective arm around a small child in at her side. The child appeared 
to be much younger, in her early teens at the very least, with long wavy 
sandy brown wet hair that hung over a sleeping face. 

Alyson shook her head, &quot;I have no idea.&quot; She said mesmerized by the 
appearance of the girl, &quot;Who is asking?&quot; She demanded still holding the 
umbrella pointed at the girl

The Sister scooped the child into her arms and began to stand, &quot;I have 
no time for this. I need to find Sophia or Melissa quickly. This girl&#39;s 
life depends on it.&quot; She slowly turned to face Alyson with a stern look 
upon her face, &quot;If you do not know where they are then could you point 
me in the direction of the Amy&#39;s place and be quick about it.&quot; She 
demanded. 

Alyson was about to protest the girl&#39;s rudeness when she noticed that 
the child&#39;s hand was dripping water upon the floor and she lowered her 
guard, &quot;What happened to her?&quot; She inquired with sincere concern. 

&quot;She is dying.&quot; The girl stated bluntly, &quot;Her life is bound to me at the 
moment, but if I don&#39;t find her help soon she will die.&quot; 

Alyson stared into the angel&#39;s yellow eyes, &quot;Bound to you? You are 
keeping her alive?&quot; 

The girl nodded and started passed Alyson, &quot;If you can not help me then 
I will have to find someone else.&quot; 

At that moment Melissa staggered down the stairs in a pink nightgown 
covered in images of bunny rabbits, &quot;What is all the commotion?&quot; She 
sleepily asked with a stretch and scratching the back of her neck. She 
blinked at Alyson and a bright smile crossed her face, &quot;Alyson! I have 
not seen you around here in a while. What brings you by?&quot; She happily 
inquired of the girl.

&quot;Aunt!!&quot; The Death Sister exclaimed as she pushed passed Alyson.

Melissa smiled at the girl, &quot;Angelina, what a happy surprised. It has 
been a long time since I last saw you. What have you been up too?&quot; She 
asked cheerfully. 

Angelina held the child in her arms out to the woman, &quot;She needs your 
help.&quot; She stated urgently. 

Melissa frowned down at the child and brushed her wet bangs out of her 
face, &quot;What a beautiful child. What happened?&quot; She asked worriedly

Angelina shook her head, &quot;I was asked by Brother to give her a letter, 
but I could not find her at her home. I searched around her home to find 
her at a bridge, looking down at the river below. I gave her the letter 
as I was told, but when she opened it she started to cry and suddenly 
jumped over the railing and dove into the waters below. She left the 
letter on the railing and I noticed a ticket to here so proceeded to 
fetch her from the river and bring her here. She was not breathing so I 
tied her soul to mine and brought her here. &quot; 

Melissa shook her head; &quot;You know that is a dangerous thing to do.&quot; She 
said disappointedly. 

Angelina gave a quick nod of her head, &quot;I am aware, but she is a friend. 
I couldn&#39;t just let her die there.&quot; 

Melissa motioned for the girl to follow, &quot;Come on then. Amy should be 
able to help her, I hope...&quot; She started down the hall out of the house 
and opened the door for Angelina and turned to find Alyson still 
standing at the end of the hall, a stunned expression upon her face and 
her eyes staring at the ground, at a small line of stuffed bunnies that 
followed behind the Head Mistress. Melissa smiled, &quot;You like them? They 
are my eyes and ears around the school.&quot; She explained simply and the 
toys turned to look up at Alyson, &quot;You coming?&quot; Melissa inquired of the 
girl. 

&quot;But... But...&quot; She pointed at the bunnies, &quot;Are they not Bug Bears?&quot; 

Melissa laughed, &quot;No, they are not Bug Bears. Think of them as the 
complete opposite. They watch over children and make sure Bug Bears and 
Dream Ghouls do not invade their dreams.&quot; She explained with a smile, 
&quot;You do not have to worry about them. They will not hurt you.&quot; 

Shaking the shock from her head Alyson circled around the stuffed toys 
to the woman where she finally found her voice, &quot;I thought you left.&quot; 
She said dumbfounded by the appearance of the woman. 

Melissa blushed in embarrassment, &quot;Sorry to worry you. I&#39;d never leave 
you all. I love you too much.&quot; She explained as she closed the door 
behind her and turned to Angelina, &quot;Amy&#39;s office is down the path to the 
left, you can&#39;t miss it.&quot; She informed the Death Angel.

Angelina started down the path and through the front gate when she 
turned around, &quot;Are you not coming?&quot; She inquired worriedly. 

Melissa slowly, almost cautiously, moved across the patio and down the 
front steps, &quot;I&#39;ll be along soon enough. I&#39;m not feeling too well so you 
run ahead.&quot; 

Alyson dropped the umbrella where she found it and followed the Head 
Mistress, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She inquired, hopping down the stairs on 
one foot and placing the crutch upon the stone pathway when she reached 
it. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Melissa breathed as she reached the bottom of the stairs 
and let out a deep breath, &quot;I&#39;m just not myself today.&quot; 

Alyson cocked her head at the woman and for the first time noticed how 
much weaker her aura was, which she realized was why she could barely 
sense the woman being inside of the house before, &quot;What happened to 
you?&quot; She inquired concernedly. 

Melissa gave the girl a crocked smile, &quot;I&#39;ve just strained myself too 
much recently.&quot; She explained as she strolled down the path with her 
hands crossed behind her back, &quot;I&#39;ll be right as rain soon enough.&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Alyson asked sceptically, keeping pace with the woman as 
they left the yard and turned left towards the nurse&#39;s office. 

Melissa simply nodded, &quot;It is nothing to worry yourself about.&quot; 

&quot;Is it because of the cracks in reality?&quot; 

Melissa flinched slightly, &quot;How would I nice girl like you know about 
that?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Alyson turned her eyes to the ground, she did know very 
well for her brother had told her numerous times about how unstable the 
walls between this world and the next were, which was why so many 
creatures from Dream Realms kept leaking into Whispering Hills. Back 
when she was young she could see things that no one else could and Drake 
saw the same things, he taught her how to focus on those things and make 
them clear, which is how she was now able to see auras and the cracks in 
the fabric of reality. 

Melissa turned her eyes to face the path before them, &quot;I would not 
believe everything that brother of you tells you.&quot; She said with a touch 
of hostility upon her words. 

Alyson glanced up at the woman in amazement, &quot;How do you know what he 
told me?&quot; 

&quot;Sophia and I know a lot more then just that.&quot; Melissa frowned at the 
girl and ran a hand through the girl&#39;s hair, &quot;For instance we have 
always known about your Promise to that man and the link he has to you.&quot; 

Alyson looked away, ashamed of her blind promise, &quot;You know about 
that...&quot; She muttered regretfully. 

Melissa stopped and took Alyson by the hand, forcing her to turn to face 
her. She took the girl&#39;s cheeks in her hands and looked her in the eyes, 
&quot;We know you are struggling with something that most of us never have to 
deal with, but no matter what you belong here. You are one of our girls. 
Do you understand me?&quot; She touched the girl upon the nose and smiled. 

Alyson slowly shook her head in disbelief as tears threatened to escape 
her, &quot;H... how can you say that? If you only knew...&quot; She stammered. 

&quot;But I do know.&quot; Melissa stated confidently, &quot;You were born Alyshione, 
neither male nor female. Your mother decided to not allow the doctors to 
change you because she wanted you to have the choice about who you were. 
She wanted to give you an androgynous name, but part of her wanted a 
girl so much that she felt ashamed about her pushing her own desires 
upon you. I also know that if she could see you today she would be so 
proud of the person you have become, gentle and kind at the same time a 
strong and protective, the best of both worlds.&quot; She said proudly. 
Alyson broke into tears and Melissa stepped towards the girl, &quot;There 
there.&quot; She soothed, wrapping her arms around the girl and holding her 
tight, stroking her hand through the girl&#39;s mangled curls. 

After a moment Alyson&#39;s sobs subsided and she wiped at her eyes with the 
heel of her hand, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry... I don&#39;t know what is wrong with 
me...&quot; 

Melissa rubbed the girl&#39;s back, &quot;Nothing is wrong with you. You are 
perfectly normal.&quot; She glanced up to see the nurse&#39;s office in the 
distance. &quot;We should catch up to my niece and find out how that child is 
doing.&quot; 

Alyson nodded as she wiped the last of the tears from her face and 
adjusted the crutch under her arm, feeling a hundred times better about 
herself and life at Whispering Hills. There was something about knowing 
her secret was out, and well kept, that made her feel safe here, safer 
then she has ever felt in her entire life. Before long they approached 
the nurse&#39;s office and were surprised to find a long line up of kids 
standing at the door. 

Angelina pacing impassionedly as she tried to find a way passed the 
crowd. She spotted her Aunt and ran over to the woman. &quot;I can&#39;t get 
inside.&quot; She stated uneasily, glancing at the crowd of girls who seemed 
to be in many stages of disarray. 

Melissa scanned the line in confusion, &quot;What is going on here?&quot; She 
asked curiously, &quot;How long have I been out for?&quot; 

Alyson let out a deep sigh, &quot;I&#39;m afraid this is because of Kimberly&#39;s 
death. It seems to have affected a lot more people then I thought 
possible.&quot; 

Melissa spun around to face Alyson, a stunned look upon her face, 
&quot;Kimberly...&quot; She rubbed at her head, &quot;I completely forgot to ask Sophia 
about that.&quot; She mumbled and turned to Alyson, &quot;What happened while I 
was gone?&quot; She hastily inquired. 

Alyson told the Head Mistress the entire story from the moment Kima and 
Kim entered Penny&#39;s dream in attempt to save Jenn from Carey to Kima 
being trapped inside of Penny&#39;s dreams and Jessica needing to enter 
those dreams in order to save them, and up to Kim&#39;s disappearance and 
strange wave of emotion she felt emit from the girl as she vanished. 

Melissa nervously curled a lock her hair around her finger as she 
listened, not interrupting once and only speaking when she was sure the 
girl was finished with her story, &quot;This is worse then I thought 
possible.&quot; She turned to face the Western Dorms, a long frown upon her 
face, &quot;I had a feeling something had happened, but nothing like this. I 
wish Sophia had not taking off to get those new girls.&quot; 

&quot;New girls?&quot; Alyson inquired, &quot;Is the dorm not full up already?&quot;

Melissa rubbed the back of her head, &quot;Seems we have no choice in the 
matter.&quot; Melissa turned back to the crowd; &quot;Well hopefully Amy has more 
information for us.&quot; She started towards the doors to the nurse&#39;s 
office, &quot;We need you girls to move to the side please.&quot; She politely 
requested of the girls standing outside of the building, &quot;We have an 
emergency here.&quot; She declared, ushering Angelina and Alyson passed the 
crowd that parted for them, and through the doors. 

Inside the found the office busier then usual as several sets of girls 
were sitting and laying upon the hospital beds, Amy running between them 
as she checked each girl over carefully. 

&quot;Amy? Sorry to interrupt you.&quot; Melissa called out over the low murmur of 
sobs and conversation. 

Amy lifted her head from the current girl she was examining and waved to 
the Head Mistress, &quot;Sorry for the crowds, we seem to have an epidemic 
here.&quot; She explained wearily as she ran down the hall to the woman, 
&quot;What can I do for you?&quot; 

Melissa placed her hand upon Angelina&#39;s shoulder, &quot;We have an emergency 
case for you.&quot;

Amy smiled at Angelina, &quot;Hey there! Haven&#39;t seen you around here in a 
while. What&#39;s up?&quot; Her eyes moved down to the child in the girl&#39;s arms 
and she needed no explanation, &quot;Oh hell, quickly bring her over here.&quot; 
She gestured to the nearest bed and signalled for the girls sitting 
there to move, &quot;Sorry ladies I need you to move for a moment.&quot; There 
were a few grumbles of disapproval, but the girl&#39;s moved from their seat 
to the other side of the room to give the nurse space to work, craning 
their necks to get a better look at the new arrival. 

&quot;What happened here?&quot; Amy asked as she opened a draw next to the bed and 
started pulling out some supplies.
