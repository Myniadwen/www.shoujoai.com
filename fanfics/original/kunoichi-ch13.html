~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shinrin Jinja

The following corridor out of the Room of Meeting led to the 
Room of Present. Just like Setsuki had told Shiki. This wooden 
door was not one to be slid. But opened. And beyond that door 
would be Yagami. Shiki took a deep breath before she pressed her 
hand into the door to open it. Her last fight with Yagami had 
been almost a complete disaster. If not for Hibuki... then 
Yagami would have killed her. Without a doubt. After Genryukai 
gave her the Mizuryu Scroll and she read it... she was made 
aware of the one thing that could stand against the 
Kuro-houhou-jutsu. It wasn&#39;t the only scroll that contained 
secrets to the defeat of the Kagayaku Family. But it did hold 
the technique that had been created specifically to take down 
Kagayaku bloodline members. Or rather... it was a technique that 
allowed them to counter the Kagayaku power. But Yagami was no 
ordinary ninja. From his current skill, he would surely grow to 
be a Grand Master of Ninjutsu. 

Would Shiki have enough to beat him?

&quot;Love is worthless in the face of power. The only way to live 
life to its fullest is to forsake emotions such as love and 
caring. Affection can be a ninja&#39;s greatest weakness...&quot; 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

It was time to find that out. The young woman forced her weight 
onto the door and shoved it open. It swung to one side of the 
doorway and revealed the next room. The Room of Present. It was 
just like the Room of Meeting. Spacey and bare. With only one 
difference. The walls of this room were adorned with open 
scrolls. Each one was of a different colour and they were all 
attached in symmetry. And on the very far side of the Room of 
Present was the bloodline descendant of Kagayaku Family. 

Yagami.

They locked eyes with each other. Shiki&#39;s stern green orbs with 
Yagami&#39;s equally confident red ones. Shiki took the time to 
observe him a little more. He was clothed differently this time 
around. His slacks were different. They were still of a light 
brown but now marked with gold prints of an intricate set of 
lines and corners. A sort of Aztec-like pattern. The red belt 
that had been wrapped around his waist in the Shinrin Jinja was 
now replaced with a white one. That possessed Kanji markings 
that Shiki couldn&#39;t quite make out from that distance. Over his 
torso was an Indian-style garb. A milk chocolate-colour shirt 
shaped like a mix between an Indian Sari and Greek toga. It had 
only one shoulder; over the left, while the right shoulder and 
right half of Yagami&#39;s chest was left exposed by it. Attached to 
his back was the crescent moon glaive he was do deadly with, 
Mikazuki Satsujinki. His braided brown ponytail flocked behind 
him. His deep red eyes studied his rival. Shiki had not 
forgotten how intimidating this man could be. Maybe even more so 
now. Because she knew what he was really capable of. And how 
well he could use that power. 

Shiki was the first between the two of them to speak. &quot;I had a 
feeling I&#39;d run into you again. I know all about you now.&quot;

Yagami sneered. &quot;Then you should know that you stand no chance 
against me. I assume that Setsuki-san wasn&#39;t enough to stop you. 
I did not think that he would win.&quot;

Shiki blinked, a little confused by that, until she realized 
that Yagami probably wasn&#39;t aware of Setsuki&#39;s true gender. So 
just ignored that and focused on what she needed to. This 
battle. And what she was going to use to win.

&quot;Setsuki-san was powerful,&quot; Shiki admitted, &quot;But I&#39;m stronger. 
In the end, that&#39;s all it amounts to. And if I were you... I 
wouldn&#39;t be so sure that I&#39;m going to win. It might not seem 
like it now. But I have improved a lot since the battle at the 
Diet Building. Give up and get out of my path so I can meet with 
your master. I don&#39;t have to kill you if you do that.&quot;

Yagami chuckled. &quot;I am not too sure about your power... but your 
confidence shines well. But what less can be expected of a woman 
who literally decimated the Six Orochi? You have done well for 
yourself, girl of Morioka. But here in the Room of Present... we 
shall conclude our battle. And you will die. Because in my veins 
flows the crimson blood of a ninja people so powerful that we 
suffered virtual genocide because of it. I will destroy you in 
the name of the Kagayaku Family and Hirotsugu-sama. Prepare 
yourself!&quot;

He wasted no time in this shot. Yagami bent ahead from the waist 
then charged straight over the large distance between the two of 
them. His speed allowed him to cover a good 85-metre gap in the 
space of a few seconds. But Shiki remained focused and calm. 
Watching his blurry image come at her. He was reaching back for 
his glaive. They soon reached striking distance of each other. 
Then his body just vanished into a blur. The relentless speed of 
the Kagayaku bloodline. Shiki&#39;s eyes flashed with understanding 
and her whole body dove backwards. To the naked eye, it looked 
like she was dodging nothing but air. She skidded backwards on 
her sandals and pressed her hand into the ground to stop moving. 
Yagami appeared again. With his Glaive at the ready. 

The older youth smiled. &quot;...You seem a bit faster than before. 
But not by much. If that is the improvement you spoke of then 
you&#39;ve signed you own life away by challenging me once again.&quot;

Shiki&#39;s eyebrows shot up, while her right hand made the 
two-finger sign. A cold anger passed through her. &quot;Don&#39;t you 
worry about me, Orochi. I&#39;ve been made aware of things that you 
couldn&#39;t dream of. Like the truth behind the Mizuryu, the 
Kagayaku and Tengu Kokomaru. But there is one question left that 
remains unanswered. And your master&#39;s gonna answer that question 
as soon as I&#39;m finished with you!&quot; 

Shiki fixed her eyes on Yagami. Stating the seriousness of her 
point. There was no more time to be spared for holding back. It 
was time for... that technique. The Secret of the Scroll. As she 
focused her Chi energy into a central point in her body; bright 
green flames started to engulf and surround the Burning 
Kunoichi. Yagami watched this curiously. He could feel that she 
was generating a large amount of Chi for this. But what was she 
doing? Shiki looked over at the older ninja; tightening her free 
hand into a fist. Her body became nothing more than a black 
silhouette with comparison to the raging green flames of her 
spiritual power. And while Yagami couldn&#39;t quite notice it... 
those flames were growing bigger. More intense. Shiki&#39;s lips 
parted swiftly and she began mouthing a chant before she was 
even partly aware that she was doing so.

&quot;Oooouuaaaaagggggggghhhhhhhhh!!!!&quot; She screamed, &quot;Chi (Blood), 
Rei (Spirit), Jiko (Self), Shinzou (Heart). Chi... Rei... 
Jiko... Shinzou...! Chi... Rei... Jiko... Shinzou...! Chi, Rei, 
Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, Jiko, Shinzou! 
Chi, Rei, Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, 
Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, Jiko, Shinzou! Chi, Rei, Jiko, 
Shinzou!&quot; 

Yagami suddenly blinked in disbelief. &quot;...It can&#39;t be! Kakegoe 
no Reiteki Jiko-Chouwa (The Chant of Spiritual Self-Unity). This 
girl... actually read the Scroll of the Mizuryu? That&#39;s 
impossible! Genryukai-san knows that only bloodline members of 
the Mizuryu Clan are allowed to read the scroll! Even HE 
wouldn&#39;t break that oath!&quot;

An evil expression was shown in Shiki&#39;s face as she burned in 
her spirit fire. &quot;...What makes you think that he broke the 
oath!? Genryukai-sama, your grandfather, is an honourable man. 
He knows full well about me and my past. The only one in the 
dark is you. And it&#39;s time you learned a bit more about me, boy. 
And about the innate powers of the only shinobi family that was 
ever capable of withstanding the might of the Kagayaku 
bloodline!&quot;

Yagami was so stunned he could hardly react. &quot;...A-Are you... 
Hirotsugu-sama&#39;s...?&quot;

Shiki said nothing more, not bothering to wait for the time to 
answer his questions. She leapt from that position and travelled 
like a bullet, knee-first. Yagami grunted hard as Shiki&#39;s smooth 
knee (still burning with green spirit fire) rammed brutally 
against his cheek. Blood spurted from his jaw as he stumbled 
back. Shiki ignored the fresh draw of blood and leapt up into 
the air with almost twice the speed as before. Her hand 
reflexively shot into one of her shuriken pouches and withdrew 
three shuriken. Her whole hand burst with more green fire, 
igniting the three shuriken on it. Her eyes viciously locked on 
the momentarily stunned Yagami. 

Her voice bellowed the attack. &quot;Mizuryu Style! San Shuri-Hou!&quot; 

Shiki&#39;s thin arm whipped around her in an arc motion and cast 
the three shuriken straight for the target below. But unlike the 
regular San Shuri-Hou, these were decorated with the lethal 
green flames of her spirit. Yagami looked upwards as he felt a 
burst of danger. His sheer adrenalin kicked in. And Yagami 
jumped backwards to avoid them. The three shuriken attack spiked 
the ground one by one. The split second after Yagami dodged the 
attack; Shiki blurred behind him with a powerful scowl. She 
rotated her hips with a frightening swiftness and extended her 
leg. Yagami grunted as Shiki&#39;s foot thrust into his ribs. It 
forced him straight back; his own sandals slid across the 
floorboards. Shiki landed in a crouched position. Her emerald 
spirit fire still burned on her body. The deep representation of 
her true powers now manifest in the physical world. Yagami wiped 
his jaw of the blood that had been drawn from his mouth during 
the first blow. Now he understood. 

&quot;Ah...&quot; He mused, &quot;...You are a member of the Mizuryu Family. I 
don&#39;t even have to ask to whom you are related. It was obvious 
from the start...&quot;

Shiki grinned at him. &quot;...So you&#39;ve finally figured it out. I 
was surprised that he didn&#39;t tell you himself. But I won&#39;t 
mistake it as shame. Rather as... hiding the facts for the 
benefit of the &#39;greater good&#39;&quot;

Yagami ignored that issue and focused on the more glaring one. 
&quot;...Regardless of that. You have mastery over the sacred skill 
of the Mizuryu Scroll. The only scroll that rivals the power of 
the Scroll of Kokomaru. It&#39;s interesting. By chanting the 
Kakegoe no Reiteki Jiko-Chouwa over and over and over again you 
are able to hypnotise yourself into believing that your powers 
are peerless. And thusly... bringing out the full potential of 
the physical body and the hidden soul. The Mizuryu Gijutsu 
(Mizuryu Technique). But this ability works within reason. At 
your age you probably couldn&#39;t keep this up for more than ten 
minutes without passing out. Even the Mizuryu and Kagayaku have 
their limits.&quot;

Shiki reached back behind her for Miyuki. &quot;I won&#39;t need ten 
minutes to take you out, Yagami-san. You are the only thing left 
that stands between me and Hirotsugu-yarou. I will kill him. 
That is my mission. And I will kill anyone who stands in the way 
of me completing my mission.&quot;

Understood. Yagami nodded. Then eased upright, taking his fist 
away from his mouth. Shiki was clearly more than he first 
thought. But Yagami of the Kagayaku Family was not leader of the 
Six Orochi for nothing. &quot;Wonderful. You really have improved 
since our battle at the Diet Building. But it presents a good 
opportunity. A rare opportunity. To express the full scope of 
the Kagayaku bloodline...&quot;

Shiki waited for his next move. She felt more ready than ever. 
Yagami watched her. But he wouldn&#39;t be using his eyes much for 
what he had planned. The Fifth Orochi made the sign of the 
shinobi and took a deep breath. Gathering strength. Gathering 
Chi. Focusing his thoughts. Just like Shiki, when he did this, 
Yagami&#39;s mustard gold spiritual fire made an appearance over his 
body. Shiki took note of this action. He was invoking the powers 
of the Kagayaku that existed within him. Then the focus turned 
on his left hand. The free one. The flames that circled it grew 
stronger and writhed more. His vision glazed over. Then he 
clutched his free hand into a fist. And extended the index 
finger of that fist outwards. And Yagami then brought his hand 
to his face in this position. He grit his teeth and then; 
defying all logic, he shoved his left index finger straight into 
his right eye socket. 

&quot;Uggh!&quot; Yagami scowled and Shiki retched as the young man 
punctured his right eye socket. He yanked the finger out of the 
hole in his skull, and  now it was coated with the pureed 
remains of what used to be his right eyeball. Effectively 
blinding himself in one eye. Yagami then brought his goo-laden 
finger to his other eyeball. And Shiki had to force her to 
resist the urge to regurgitate as Yagami ruthlessly poked out 
his second eye. New blood surged from it as well, running down 
the frame of his cheek and dripping to the floor. She couldn&#39;t 
believe it. The man had willingly blinded himself. What on earth 
was that about? Surely this had nothing to do with Ninjutsu? 
Yagami pulled his finger out of his bloody eye socket and 
breathed heavily. He had never expected to use this against 
anyone. 

Yagami flicked the scrambled remains of his eyeballs off his 
finger. &quot;...Now then. Shall we?&quot;

&quot;You insane lunatic...&quot; Shiki replied, disgusted, &quot;Why on earth 
would you mutilate your own body like that? Has your own power 
driven you mad?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh. Thanks to the supernatural properties infused 
into the blood of the Kagayaku Family, my eyes will regenerate 
in a few hours time. But for now they are useless. I wish to 
introduce you to a technique that my ancestors invented. Shinda 
Koukei (Dead Sight).&quot;

Shiki had no idea what this maniac had planned but killing a 
blind man was not out of her range. The girl lunged forwards 
with all the increased speeds given to her by the Mizuryu 
Technique. Her hand gripped the hilt of Miyuki ready to draw it. 
One quick kill and then Hirotsugu would be next. Shiki sharply 
withdrew the sword and brought it around in an arc motion, to 
cut through the head of Yagami. Things seemed to slow down from 
then. The blade of the short sword reached closer and closer to 
a blow through the cranium. But one second Yagami was there... 
then the next he was gone. The now blind Fifth Orochi swung 
himself straight out of the path of Shiki&#39;s attack and rotated 
around the younger shinobi. He zoomed behind her with more blood 
dripping from his punctured eye sockets. Then reached for the 
Mikazuki Satsujinki. He pulled it from his back, twirled it 
around and slashed violently at the back of the Burning 
Kunoichi. Shiki grunted from the pain as the curved edge of the 
glaive sliced her open from her back waist upwards. She 
staggered ahead to get away from a second offensive. 

She peered over her shoulder with a stunned glare. &quot;...How did 
you...?&quot;

&quot;Sight isn&#39;t everything,&quot; The self-blinded Yagami said with a 
grin, &quot;At least not the physical sight of the body. My Mind&#39;s 
Eye compensates for the loss of my eye sight. You see in this 
form of Ninjutsu... when I wound a sense that my body possesses 
(in this case; sight) I can enhance the reflexes of my other 
senses. So you might have increased your speed and power with 
the Mizuryu Technique... but I can recompense that with a boost 
to my ability to reprise any attack you so choose to launch. 
This in effect... negates your slight advantages over me.&quot;

Shiki scowled as Yagami stated laughing at her. &quot;...Clever 
bastard...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Outside the Shinrin Jinja

The Hibuki Clone rushed forwards at one of the eight lesser 
ninja that were surrounding him. It gripped the copy of 
Tsumeitai Ryuu Ga and went straight for the neck of the closest 
ninja. The short sword slashed straight at the throat of the 
unknown minor shinobi. As soon as that sleek blade found its 
mark, the Hibuki Replica ripped the sword straight out. The 
gagging chokes of the ninja continued as he dropped to the 
ground. Dead as a doornail. His corpse simply joined one of many 
that laid dead over the front way of the Shinrin Jinja. The 
Hibuki Clone had left its sizable mark on this place. More than 
twenty shinobi for the Mizuryu Clan had been killed by it 
already. But more were making an appearance to it. They were 
very zealous. The bona fide Hibuki could see that from his 
position on one of the far oak trees. Those men and women were 
more than willing to die for the Mizuryu Clan and its leader, 
Hirotsugu. And in some respects, Hibuki could relate to that. He 
had things to protect too. Like his family. Now that his secret 
was out, now that Hirotsugu knew Hibuki was secretly working 
with Genryukai; the other members of the Uchida Family were 
bound to be targeted by him. Unless Shiki was successful in her 
assassination attempt. And Hibuki could only pray that she would 
be. They really couldn&#39;t afford to fail now. 

So until Shiki got the job done, he had to keep the Mizuryu Clan 
out of her way. Hibuki used his right hand to wipe the sweat 
from his face while the other made the two-finger sign. This 
Mizuppoi Gizou Harada technique (derived from Ryoko&#39;s abilities) 
put a large amount of strain on his Chi supply. Maybe not as 
much as the Kogoeta Kankyou did, but it was a battle all the 
same. All the same. Hibuki had no choice in the matter. Keeping 
the Mizuryu busy with a copy was a good strategy in that would 
hold out for a little longer. The Uchida Brother then took a 
deeper look at the battlefield. His watery copy had slaughtered 
another three of the lower class ninja. But the remaining four 
were getting into position for a conjoined attack. Something 
that Hibuki had forgotten the Mizuryu were aware of. 

There were five main styles of Ninjutsu in the modern world. 
Weapon-based (involving tools like kunai, swords, shuriken and 
any individual/personal item the user could develop a use for), 
Elemental Chi-based (attacks involving the spiritual elements of 
the person&#39;s Chi; like fire and lightning), Physically Chi-based 
(skills that used the body and Chi with magical influence, like 
martial arts and illusions), Forbidden (ancient skills that are 
generally tied to blood and are very rare) and last came the 
Contemporary (modern skills invented in recent years of memory). 

Hibuki remembered that the Mizuryu Clan specialized in 
Contemporary Arts (hence most of the Six Orochi were familiar 
with Compound Ninjutsu, a sub-style of Contemporary Arts). One 
of those Contemporary skills happened to be Kessoku-jutsu (Art 
of Unity). Which involved working as a team to give out even 
stronger attacks than any one individual could muster. It wasn&#39;t 
a good thing; but Hibuki was pleased that these lesser ninja 
were going all out. It probably meant that they hadn&#39;t figured 
out that the target for their attack was just a water-borne 
imitation of the real thing.  

The four lesser shinobi surrounded the Hibuki Clone and all 
withdrew a kunai, holding it above their heads. Hibuki began to 
sense a strong gathering of Chi energy from them. Now he knew 
what this technique was. And it wasn&#39;t good news. A heavy 
variation of Compound Ninjutsu. Triple Compound Ninjutsu. Using 
three techniques fused into one. Hibuki knew each one of the 
three techniques they were going to use from memory of this 
assault. One would be Kunai-jutsu (Art of Kunai), obviously. The 
second was going to be Kessoku-jutsu, due to the team effort. 
The third would involve forms of Elemental Chi-based attacks. 
All three skills/styles meshed into one attack. It was bound to 
be powerful. 

Over at the front of the Shinrin Jinja, the kunai of one of the 
lesser ninja burst with a bright red flame above his head. &quot;Hi!&quot; 
(Fire!)

...The second ninja&#39;s kunai did the same. But with blue flames. 
&quot;Mizu!&quot; (Water!) 

...As did the third ninja with his brown flames... &quot;Tsuchi!&quot; 
(Earth!)

And finally the fourth one with green flames. &quot;Kaze!&quot; (Wind!) 

Each of them the pointed their flaming kunai to the centre of 
the ring they had formed around the target of their attack. That 
was the Hibuki Clone. The counterfeit copy looked at all four of 
them. Keeping its eyes open. It would have to dodge this rather 
than block and hope for a counter-offensive to come to mind. All 
of the lesser ninja shouted the attack at the fake man who was 
about to receive it. They all screamed in unison, 

&quot;Renzoku Shuugeki! Genso no Ha!&quot;
(Sequence Attack! Element&#39;s Wave!)
 
Each of the four warriors threw their element-flaming kunai 
straight for the centre of the ring. A bright light flashed from 
that point onwards. The combined lights of the elemental Chi. 
The Hibuki Clone leapt upwards so fast that the action appeared 
to be nothing more than a judder of movement. Its body climbed 
skywards until he was a good twenty-metres above the four 
attackers. It then quickly went for the kunai pouches at its 
thighs. Two kunai to either hand. The copy then aimed the kunai 
down and began spinning its body in motion; while the four kunai 
in his hands gathered an icy presence of their own. 

&quot;Yon Kunai-Kori!&quot;
(Four Kunai-Ice!)

The Hibuki Clone flung down the four kunai to strike the lesser 
ninja. They were so thrown by the failure of their Triple 
Compound Skill that avoiding the iced kunai would have been 
impossible. Each one of the minor Mizuryu Clan members were 
struck in the chest by the icy sharp kunai of the Yon Kunai-Kori 
attack. Each kunai striking a vital point in the body. Each 
ninja falling down dead seconds later. The Hibuki copy slowly 
descended from the air; body still spinning, and landed to the 
ground safely. The second he did this; another eight shinobi 
from the Mizuryu blurred into sight for a new challenge.

From the distant oak tree, Hibuki was growing impatient. These 
Mizuryu guys were not stupid. They might have had the 
disadvantage now but their attacks were slowly wearing the Ice 
Shinobi down. It would only be a matter of time before the gas 
in Hibuki&#39;s tank ran out. And Hirotsugu had more than enough 
shinobi to spare until it did. 

&quot;...C&#39;mon, Yui-san...&quot;
