<a href="../original/angelgift-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>The black haired young man smiled slightly as they
strode down the corridor together, both of their black
with silver trim uniforms crisp and neat. &quot;So what do
you think of our new arrivals?&quot; Alex Keron asked
curiously.

Kayla Shen raised a delicate eyebrow, &quot;I haven&#39;t seen
enough to judge.&quot; A bit more sternly the pink haired
woman added, &quot;You might be careful making that sort of
comment, this is a military vessel not one of our
usual Corps of Engineer ships.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Alex admitted.

They entered the ship&#39;s mess hall and headed to the
banks, tapping in requests then watching as the trays
slid out loaded with food. The seats were mostly
empty, reflecting the skeleton crew that currently
staffed the Liberty&#39;s Sword.

&quot;I noticed you were working with our new tactical
officer,&quot; Kayla noted as she began to methodically cut
and eat her vegetable.

&quot;Amara,&quot; Alex nodded to herself thoughtfully. He
leaned forward to add, &quot;You know, I&#39;m pretty certain
that she must have had some military experience,&quot; he
paused to eat a bite before adding, &quot;or else was a
privateer.&quot;

Kayla looked amused, &quot;The privateer wouldn&#39;t surprise
me, actually.&quot;

&quot;She does have that... rebellious look,&quot; Alex agreed
as he took a drink. &quot;Sharin should be good on the
helm, though,&quot; he mused.

&quot;Her file ratings are impressive,&quot; Kayla quietly
admitted, &quot;but as a Questor I think she&#39;d have some
authority issues.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Alex nodded glumly.

&quot;Well, let&#39;s just hope we don&#39;t run into a fight
before we get back to the Throne,&quot; Kayla sighed,
slicing her serving of fish carefully.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t bet on it,&quot; Alex said.

&quot;Incoming,&quot; Kayla murmured as the two women walked
inside, talking quietly.

Kat held Roma&#39;s hand, the brown haired young woman
smiling to herself happily. &quot;You know,&quot; she said
gently, &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for you to finally say
something.&quot;

If Roma could blush, she probably would have. &quot;I was
worried about how you felt,&quot; she scolded, &quot;we do come
from very different worlds.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Kat conceded as they sat down at a
table to talk, keeping a respectful distance from the
other officers. &quot;I&#39;m really surprised at how few
people there are on board.&quot;

Roma nodded thoughtfully, &quot;This ship is running below
even the minimum requirements for crew.&quot; At Kat&#39;s
curious look she continued, &quot;According to the
regulations I downloaded, a vessel of this class
should have at least fifty-one officers.&quot;

&quot;And how many do they actually have?&quot; Kat asked.

&quot;Twenty-five,&quot; Roma answered, &quot;stretched thinly over
three shifts.&quot;

&quot;That explains the relieved looks some of the bridge
crew got when they heard we&#39;re joining,&quot; Kat blinked,
digesting that.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Roma agreed. She tilted her head to the
side and asked, &quot;How is the reviewing of medical
guides going?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s remarkably simple,&quot; Kat said with a relieved
smile, &quot;the equipment in there can handle almost any
sort of injury.&quot; She paused, &quot;Though sorting through
all of the alien species on board is going to take me
some time.&quot;

&quot;How many are there?&quot; Roma looked curious.

&quot;All seven of the Empire&#39;s major species,&quot; Kat frowned
as she tried to remember them all, &quot;Throneworld
natives, Rimborians, D&#39;Kenites, the Catwomen of
Grimbor, some Magi, Erehwon colonists and you, a
synthoid.&quot;

Roma quietly chuckled to herself, &quot;I&#39;m not sure that
Synthoids count as a species, but I thank you for the
compliment.&quot;

&quot;I was glad to read some of the information on you,&quot;
Kat added, &quot;it was very informative.&quot;

&quot;Like?&quot; Roma blinked.

Kat smiled with pure wickedness, &quot;Not only are your
people anatomically correct, you can restructure your
bodies for other... functions.&quot;

It took Roma only a second to get that then she
scolded, &quot;Kat!&quot;

Kat just smirked.

The engine room, Allison had to admit to herself,
really did remind her of some science fiction she had
read. The brown haired woman had quietly entered to
look around, scrolling through a hand-held data file
on the systems as she looked around.

The engine itself operated via hyperspace, more or
less. It generated a unique energy field that
interacted with the fabric of space, creating gates
into another realm with very different physical laws.
Traveling just a short distance there equated to much
larger distances here, allowing for rapid but not
instant travel across space.

Throughout the ship flux nodes were in place, modules
that helped produce the field that opened the gate to
hyperspace. Their power consumption was hideous,
however, which was what required these massive
generators. There were three fusion reactors, columns
that towered above the crew around them, each one able
to run a massive city.

&quot;What are you doing in here?&quot; a curious voice asked,
calling Allison&#39;s attention away from the technology
she was studying.

The golden haired woman was rake thin, almost
delicate, but her eyes were sharp as she looked
Allison over. &#39;Glad I didn&#39;t wear my rank insignia,&#39;
Allison thought as she said, &quot;I&#39;m one of the new
arrivals, I wanted to try and see where I could help
out.&quot;

&quot;Chief Engineer Lucas Anais,&quot; she introduced herself
distractedly, &quot;sorry I haven&#39;t been up to greet you
all, but I&#39;ve been pretty busy.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully my friends can help put some of your
engineers back to doing their regular jobs,&quot; Allison
offered.

&quot;It&#39;ll be nice,&quot; Lucas nodded, then looked down at her
curiously to ask, &quot;what is your job going to be,
anyway?&quot;

&quot;Ah....&quot; Allison looked sheepish.

&quot;Captain,&quot; the lift popped open as Lauren emerged,
looking around the room until she saw Allison, &quot;what
are you doing down here?&quot;

&quot;Captain?&quot; Lucas blinked at Allison in surprise.

&quot;It&#39;s new to me,&quot; Allison sighed as Lauren rushed up.
To her second in command she said, &quot;Sorry, I wanted to
take a look around.&quot;

&quot;You might want to give me some warning next time,&quot;
Lauren frowned.

Allison smiled slightly, &quot;I left Sam in command, he
didn&#39;t object.&quot;

Lucas smiled slightly, watching the two of them
interacting. &quot;You&#39;re not quite what I was expecting,&quot;
she conceded.

&quot;Let me know what I can do to help,&quot; Allison smiled
wryly, &quot;as it seems my attempt to covertly find out
what&#39;s going on failed.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make blanket promises,&quot; Lauren quietly added,
&quot;any engineer usually has a shopping list of things
they want.&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Lucas smirked.

&quot;All right,&quot; Allison conceded the point, &quot;how about a
reasonable list of requests? Considering we&#39;re leaving
in a day or so....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass it on,&quot; Lucas frowned as another officer
signaled her then excused herself.

Allison meekly followed Laurel to step into the lift,
the fields swiftly drawing them upwards through the
ship. &quot;Any emergencies?&quot; she asked crisply.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Lauren smiled, &quot;but the day is young.&quot;</pre>
