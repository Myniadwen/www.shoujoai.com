<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch50.html">Back to Part 50</a><pre>Natalie let out a sigh, they had been sitting in the lobby in silence 
for an hour and it was beginning to drive her nuts. Jessica seemed to be 
lost deep in their own thoughts while Amy spent much of her time in the 
office cleaning up and sifting through files. Natalie figured that Amy 
was probably looking for something that will help her with Jessica 
because she kept glancing at the girl from time to time. Alyson slept 
curled up upon the couch, earlier Natalie had asked if she wanted to go 
back to her room but she wanted to let Misty be alone and Natalie 
figured she was right. Kim also had no room to return too with Jenn 
upset so was curled up on Natalie&#39;s lap. She considered turning on the 
television when Jenn slowly entered the room. 

Natalie cocked her head curiously at the girl, &quot;You alright?&quot; She 
inquired noticing the way Jenn&#39;s eyes flickered to Jessica as she 
crossed the room. 

Jenn approached the couches and glanced down at Kim then to Kima, &quot;I 
only came to see how Kim and Kima were doing.&quot; She stated coldly, making 
sure that Jessica heard her. She knelt next to Kima and lightly touched 
the girl&#39;s forehead, &quot;She feels cold.&quot; She commented worriedly. 

&quot;Actually it is a little cold.&quot; Natalie agreed, rubbing her arms, &quot;Are 
their blankets down here?&quot; 

Jessica pointed to the storage closet next to the entrance, &quot;Back 
there.&quot; She muttered softly. 

Jenn moved around the couches to the storage room and opened it. The 
room was actually rather large with many shelves and boxes scattered 
about. She found the blankets on the shelf closest to the door and piled 
a few in her arms before closing the door behind her, then she returned 
to the girls and handed one to Alyson.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Alyson took the blanket groggily and pulled it over herself. 

&quot;How is your arm?&quot; Jenn inquired, glancing at the bandages as she walked 
around to Natalie. 

Alyson shrugged, &quot;I don&#39;t notice the pain much.&quot; She remarked with a 
half smile, &quot;Thanks for asking though.&quot; 

Jenn placed one blanket on the coffee table as she unfolded the other 
and placed it over Kim, &quot;How is she doing?&quot; She asked worriedly. 

&quot;She is strong.&quot; Natalie replied, &quot;I hear she arrived just in time.&quot; 

Jenn gave a weak smile, &quot;Yeah, she is always rescuing me when I wanted 
to be the one to rescue her.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s strange that way.&quot; Natalie stated with a soft laugh, &quot;I&#39;ve been 
trying to rescue her for years and always seem to get there after the 
action is over. What a pathetic heroine I&#39;m turning out to be.&quot; 

Jenn shook her head in disagreement, &quot;You&#39;re a true heroine and a good 
friend too.&quot; 

Natalie gave a warm smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot; Her smile suddenly turned to a 
frown as an intense pain ripped through her chest.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Jenn concernedly ask. 

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Natalie clenched at her chest, &quot;M... My ch... 
chest feels like it is on fire. Like someone is trying to rip my heart 
out.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll get Amy.&quot; Jenn was about to turn around when Kimberly&#39;s eyes 
suddenly fluttered open and she let out a howling scream that was a mix 
of agony and pain. 

&quot;Kim!?!&quot; Jenn dropped to the girl&#39;s side.

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Amy inquired, rushing out of the office to see what the 
commotion was about. 

&quot;H... hurts...&quot; Kim gasped as she grabbed at her chest and rolled off of 
Natalie&#39;s lap to the floor. 

Natalie also held on to her chest and buckled over as a wave of sorrow 
engulfed her heart.

&quot;Nat?!?&quot; Alyson reached out for the girl, &quot;Nat, are you alright?&quot;

&quot;K... Ki... ma...&quot; Natalie gasped as she struggled with another wave of 
emotion, this time of intense fear, &quot;Some... thing... is happening to 
her.&quot; 

Amy ran around the couches and knelt beside Kim, &quot;Where does it hurt?&quot; 
She asked trying to figure out how to relieve the girl of her pain. 

&quot;E... Every... where...&quot; Kim cried out. She quickly rolled over and 
puked on the floor, then collapsed to her side, as another wave of sobs 
ripped through her. 

Amy pulled Kim&#39;s eyelid back to look into the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;This is not 
good.&quot; She stated trying to keep calm. Suddenly Kim&#39;s face faded and for 
a brief moment Amy thought she could see the floor beneath the girl.

Natalie glanced at Amy, &quot;K... ki.. ma...&quot; She stated, struggling against 
the pain that was trying to overwhelm her, &quot;S... she... &#39;s in 
trouble...&quot; 

Amy shook her head skeptically, &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; She watched 
as Kim flickered transparent again and this time staying that way, 
almost like a ghost, &quot;What the hell?&quot; She quickly got to her feet and 
glanced between Kima and Kim.

Jessica got to her feet and rushed over to see what was happening, &quot;Is 
she going to be alright?&quot; Staring down at the redhead as she faded from 
existence.

&quot;Kim is dying.&quot; Amy explained in despair.

&quot;What? How?&quot; Jenn exclaimed aghast, looking between the two redheads. 

Amy rubbed her temple in frustration, &quot;I never told you girls before, 
but Kima is not Kim&#39;s reflection.&quot; She explained, sitting heavily upon a 
couch as she tried to figure out what to do. 

&quot;Then what is she?&quot; Alyson inquired, curious to learn more about the 
mysterious mirror girl. 

Jenn eyed the nurse, &quot;I thought she was Kim&#39;s inner feelings. The stuff 
she pushed aside.&quot; 

Amy rubbed the back of her neck, &quot;She is so much more.&quot; Amy gazed at 
Kima then to Kim, who was fading with every second, &quot;But it is Kim that 
is the reflection.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Jenn stared at Kim in astonishment, &quot;How can that be? I mean Kim 
was the one to save me from my dreams. Kima didn&#39;t show up until after 
we arrived here.&quot; 

&quot;That is true.&quot; Amy agreed, &quot;However, Kim never existed. Kima created 
her so she could cope with her past, giving her someone to protect and 
with there being two of her Kima did not feel she needed to restrain 
herself as much because she knew being sexual was expected of her.&quot; 

Natalie struggled to stand, &quot;That&#39;s insane.&quot; She stated, not believing a 
word she was hearing, &quot;Kima had a cut on the opposite arm as me. If Kim 
is not the real one then why was I mimicking her pain?&quot; 

&quot;Not mimicking.&quot; Amy explained, &quot;You were mirroring Kima&#39;s pain. You 
thought Kim was the real one because she had the same wounds as you, but 
in fact the real Kim would have opposite wounds. You never considered 
that before so you rejected Kima before getting to understand her. Now 
she is finding a home inside Penny&#39;s dreams and has no reason to return 
or a need for Kim anymore.&quot;

&quot;There must be a way to wake her up.&quot; Jenn stated, desperately searching 
for some kind of answer.

&quot;If we wake her now we risk losing her mind entirely.&quot; Amy stated 
calmly, &quot;We also risk hurting Penny and Jessica.&quot; 

Jessica nervously ran a hand across her face, &quot;I can feel her in there. 
She is taking my place in that nightmarish world.&quot; She rubbed at the 
back of her neck in frustration, &quot;You have to get her out of there.&quot;

&quot;I want to help her.&quot; Jenn exclaimed frantically, &quot;How do I get into 
that dream?&quot; 

&quot;You can&#39;t&quot; Alyson remarked collectedly, &quot;You are not a dream walker. 
You are only a dreamer.&quot; 

&quot;What about Kris?&quot; Jessica asked starting for the door. 

&quot;No. Jessica, you are the only one who can get to her.&quot; Amy bluntly 
stated, &quot;You share Penny&#39;s experiences and dreams. You are the only one 
who can get in there safely. If Kima is in as deeply as I think, Kris 
could cause more damage then help. We need someone who was from the 
dream originally.&quot;

Jessica violently shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; Jessica clenched at the 
side of her head, &quot;I can&#39;t go back there.&quot; She protested, terrified of 
the thought of having to face that house again.

&quot;You have to.&quot; Amy returned, &quot;You said it yourself, Kima is taking your 
place in your dream. She is losing a piece of herself every moment she 
is there. Without her Kim will simply disappear and Kima may never 
return to us again.&quot; 

&quot;Why is that my problem?&quot; Jessica shouted at the nurse, &quot;She was the one 
who invaded my dreams. I did not ask her to come after me.&quot; 

&quot;It is not your dream.&quot; Alyson stated numbly, &quot;It is Penny&#39;s.&quot; She 
nodded at the girl on the couch. 

Penny was trashing about and moaning. Her body trapped by the effects of 
some eternal night terror.

&quot;You must go back.&quot; Amy insisted, &quot;You are the only one who can stop 
this. You have to free her of that nightmare. You have to save them 
all.&quot;
