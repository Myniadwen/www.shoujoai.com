<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch60.html">Back to Part 60</a><pre>Jessica twitched in her sleep and hit her head against one of the 
bench&#39;s legs. She painfully stretched; it felt as if she had fell sleep 
on several nails. Her right side had fallen asleep and she could feel 
pins and needles through her body. She glanced up to see that the sun 
had finally risen in the sky and forced her body to stand, hobbling 
around the shed in an attempt to get some of the blood circulating 
through her legs. 

With the aid of the newly raised sun she finally got a good look at her 
surroundings and the many tools that lay skewed about the shed. There 
were old rusty hedge clippers that she figured had not been used in a 
decade or two. Dozens of small gardening shovels for when Ma&#39;am felt 
like planting flowers and other plants around the outskirts of the 
house. The woman was a slave when it came to the look of the house. It 
was as if she did not want the neighbours to know that she was keeping a 
farm for children in the place. Jessica then came across a pair of 
baseball bats that were covered in cobwebs, one aluminium and the other 
wood painted black, she pondered if either ever had the chance to be 
used by a child. She figured they were probably brought here by some of 
the other kids over the years and confiscated the moment they entered 
the house. The rest of the room was filled with more rusty tools that 
probably had not seen the light of day since before she was born. 

Suddenly she heard the faint sound of the back door to the house opening 
and rushed to the back of the shed, where she hid in the corner. She 
could heard the sound of dry leaves crunching under foot as someone 
crossed the lawn and preyed that it was not the old witch. The shed door 
slowly opened and a young girl entered the room, &quot;Jessie?&quot; The girl 
called out softly as she let the door close behind her. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Jessica replied, cautiously stepping out of her hiding place. 
Before her stood a small girl with orange curly hair and a warm smile 
upon her freckled covered face, &quot;A... Amber?&quot; She inquired nervously. 
She felt as if it had been decades since she had last seen the girl, but 
she could never forget that smile. 

Amber rushed across the shed, curls bouncing around her shoulders and 
skirt fluttering around her knees as she ran, &quot;Oh Jessie,&quot; She exclaimed 
as she threw her arms around Jessica&#39;s neck, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you so much.&quot; 
She said through tears of happiness. 

Jessica squeezed the girl tightly, allowing herself to breath in the 
girl&#39;s scent, how could she have forgotten this smell and the softness 
of Amber&#39;s cheek brushing against her own, &quot;I...&quot; She found it hard to 
speak and her heart was pounding wildly in her chest. She pulled back to 
look upon the girl&#39;s face. It had been so long since she gazed into 
those loving green eyes. So long since she held the girl that she 
thought only existed in her dreams. She tried to tell her heart to calm 
down but it would not listen, all it cared about was being able to hold 
Amber once again. Jessica struggled with the need to touch the girl for 
fear that this world would shatter into a million pieces and she would 
find herself back in her bed all alone again. However she found it 
impossible to take her eyes off Amber and she hugged the girl again in 
an attempt to stop the hammering of her heart. 

&quot;Jessie, are you alright?&quot; Amber inquired curiously, &quot;You are acting 
strangely.&quot; 

&quot;I... I just... need to...  hold you.&quot; Jessica explained simply as she 
set her head upon the girl&#39;s shoulder. The scent of Amber&#39;s hair drifted 
to Jessica&#39;s nose and she licked her lips, struggling with a deep 
longing to once again taste the girl. Unable to hold back the urge any 
longer she lightly kissed Amber upon the neck. 

&quot;Ummm... Jessie...?&quot; Amber weakly protested, after watching Kim and 
Penny all day she was feeling the need for a kiss herself and right now 
Jessica was not helping, &quot;J... jessie... we... we... shouldn&#39;t...&quot; She 
stammered as Jessica slowly placed kisses along her neck and up to her 
jaw line. A shiver over came her body and she bit lightly at Jessica&#39;s 
shoulder. Quickly she pulled back and placed a kiss upon the girl&#39;s 
lips. 

For a moment Jessica was startled by Amber&#39;s suddenness, but did not 
protest. She wrapped her arms around the girl and pulled her in close. 
The feeling of that kiss suddenly opened up a door in the back of 
Jessica&#39;s mind, a door that she had long locked and nailed shut. She 
suddenly understood what it was that she had been searching for in all 
those other girls over the years and Amber was that missing piece to the 
puzzle piece in her life. She could always remember that smell like a 
fleeting memory that was just out of her grasp and now as she held the 
girl in her arms she felt that she finally was where she belonged. With 
this newfound awareness she came to accept that the thing she wanted 
more than anything else was to taste the sweetness of her first love 
once again, to savour that feeling before she lost it yet again. Her 
entire body shivered with the feeling of the girl&#39;s fingers playing with 
the back of her hair.  

They intensified their kiss, Amber slipping her tongue into Jessie&#39;s 
mouth and dancing around her tongue. Soon Jessica found herself shoved 
up against the bench as Amber&#39;s body pressed up against her own. Jessica 
felt herself being drawn into the sensation of Amber&#39;s lips as a heat 
rose up over her body. She had forgotten how good Amber tasted and felt 
as if she would melt in the girl&#39;s arms. Amber&#39;s hands move through the 
side of her overalls, down the back of her spine and caress her butt. 
Jessica pulled back from the kiss and stared at the girl before her, was 
this the Amber she had left all those years ago? She had a hard time 
remembering, she had blocked everything about this place from her mind, 
the good and the bad, and now wished that she could savour this 
experience forever. 

Amber grinned back at her then moved in for another kiss. Jessica could 
feel her control slipping even more. She needed to stop this before 
something bad happens, but she couldn&#39;t force herself to step away. All 
she needed to do was to walk away and the nightmare would be over, but 
she thirsted for more. Amber was the only person she wanted to touch her 
and now she was getting that wish. A tear welled up in her eyes and she 
felt an urge to let her hand wander over her body. She wanted to feel 
Amber&#39;s smooth skin under her fingers. Wanted to run her fingers along 
the girl&#39;s thigh and between her legs. As she thought of these desires 
Amber&#39;s hand moved along her thigh and up the leg of her boxers. She let 
out a quivered moan as the sensation of Amber&#39;s fingers lightly petting 
her damp crotch ran through her body. Jessica knew she should stop, knew 
that nothing good would come from this but she finally gave into the 
desire. She unbuttoned one of the straps of her overalls and moved 
Amber&#39;s hand down the front of her boxers. Amber&#39;s fingers were lightly 
tracing Jessica&#39;s outer lips when the door abruptly opened and Ma&#39;am 
stormed into the shed.

&quot;Why you sluts!!&quot; The woman screamed at the girls. For an old woman she 
moved quickly and was upon the girls in seconds, her hand coming down 
hard upon Jessica&#39;s surprised face with a slap that sent Jessica to the 
floor. 

&quot;Owww.&quot; Jessica shrunk away from the woman&#39;s blows. 

&quot;Ma&#39;am, No!!&quot; Amber cried out as the woman hit her lover, &quot;It&#39;s not her 
fault.&quot; 

The woman turned to glare at Amber, &quot;I&#39;ve seen the way she looks at you. 
She is sinful. I should have known she would try to corrupt you the 
moment I laid eyes on her.&quot;  

&quot;But Ma&#39;am!&quot; Jessica tried to explain her actions only to be hit across 
the head again. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you talk back to me,&quot; Ma&#39;am shouted hatefully, &quot;I&#39;ve seen the way 
you curl up with her at night. I&#39;ve suspected that something was up for 
months now but I trusted Amber to not be pulled into your spell. I guess 
I was wrong.&quot; 

&quot;She didn&#39;t put a spell on me.&quot; Amber desperately protested, &quot;I love 
her.&quot; She cried out. 

Ma&#39;am was appalled by what she was hearing, &quot;You are too young to 
understand love.&quot; She remarked then grabbed Amber by the arm, &quot;I&#39;ll make 
sure that little slut learns her lesson, but good.&quot; She dragged Amber 
out of the shed and glared back at Jessica, &quot;You will learn to keep your 
hands to yourself and to be a good little girl.&quot; She stated firmly. 

Fear and hatred filled Jessica&#39;s mind, fear of losing Amber and being 
locked away in this shed again, anger for the woman who ruined her life 
entirely and gave her so many sleepless nights. Without hesitation 
Jessica stormed across the shed, her hand came across the discarded 
aluminium baseball bat and she swung it at the quickly closing shed door 
with enough force to knock the woman off her feet, in turn causing her 
to let go of Amber. Jessica leapt through the door and upon the woman 
with the bat held high over her head and brought it down with all of her 
strength. It struck the woman&#39;s head with a muddy thud and sunk deep 
into the woman&#39;s skull like it was made of warm wax. Jessica pulled the 
bat free of Ma&#39;am head and stared down at the mess. Her skull was 
smashed in and there was a strange green slime oozing out of the wound. 

&quot;S... she was not human... She really was a witch.&quot; Jessica breathed as 
she watched in disgust as the woman&#39;s head began to boil over and her 
body melt away. Jessica began to laugh hysterically, &quot;Who would have 
thought that Sarah would be right?&quot; 

Amber cautiously approached Jessica&#39;s side and stared down at the women 
as she sizzled and dissolved into the grass, &quot;Y... you killed her.&quot; She 
stammered, horrified that Jessica could kill someone. She suddenly 
covered her mouth against the foul smell that began to drift in the air. 

Jessica smiled at the girl, &quot;I can save you after all.&quot; She remarked 
gleefully. She turned to the house and was about to enter it when it 
started to shift and transform. The walls began to decay and crumble as 
if years were passing by in mere seconds and the sun quickly dropped 
from the sky. Fear filled Jessica&#39;s eyes as the house took on the form 
from her nightmares, &quot;N... no... anything but this...&quot; She pleaded 
worriedly, &quot;Why does it have to be this?&quot; 

Amber watched the house in horror as it took on a new life before her 
eyes, &quot;Jessica... what is happening?&quot; She asked nervously, unsure if she 
wanted to know the answer. 

&quot;It&#39;s becoming like in my nightmares.&quot; Jessica explained with a deep 
breath and clenching onto the bat, &quot;I hope Penny is ready to leave this 
time. With or without that belt of hers.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Kim found Penny&#39;s belt.&quot; Sarah explained happily. 

&quot;What?&quot; Jessica glanced at her lover, &quot;How did she do that?&quot; 

Amber only shrugged, &quot;She fought with some kind of creature in the tub 
and had it in her hand when she returned.&quot; 

Jessica shook her head in disbelief, &quot;To think that girl has only been 
here one day when I could not find that thing for years. Maybe she is 
the key to getting out of this nightmare.&quot;
