10:37 am

 

&quot;A team meeting at noon today? That&#39;s a little irresponsible! Why wasn&#39;t 
I told sooner?&quot;

&quot;I just learned about it myself,&quot; Shiki said. Fleur didn&#39;t sound pleased 
at all, not that Araya could really blame her. She barely had ninety 
minutes to get ready; being new to the team made her feel like people 
were deliberately keeping her out of the loop. &quot;Leena and milady have 
been calling people all day, and I only recently got your number. I 
didn&#39;t even know you were on the team until then.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay, it&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Fleur blared with scathing sarcasm. 
&quot;I expected them to drop the ball on this. God forbid we ever work with 
competent people. Well, you may as well tell me the wheres and 
wherefores.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re doing the best with what they have,&quot; Shiki growled. &quot;You don&#39;t 
have to insult them. Leena only called it recently, and we&#39;ve been 
working hard trying to let every- &quot;

&quot;Yes, yes, you&#39;ve told me all this before. So where am I supposed to 
go?&quot;

&quot;The field,&quot; Shiki stated as she felt her patience draining. Fleur had 
every right to be angry, but she didn&#39;t have to be venomous about it. 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to bring anything either.&quot;

&quot;Fine. I guess I should thank you for letting me in on this, even if it 
is at the last minute.&quot;

&quot;Someone always has to be the last to know,&quot; Shiki countered. Fleur 
laughed out loud.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re right! And I did feel like it would be me. Well, I guess 
this means I&#39;ll be seeing you later.&quot;

&quot;Um, right. Sorry about all that.&quot;

&quot;I told you not to worry,&quot; she giggled tartly. They both hung up, and 
Shiki drew a deep breath as she marked the last name from her list. If 
her labors were any indication of the problems to come...

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;A Preview of Things to Come&quot;

 

The world seemed more alive as it took its last melancholic sigh of 
summer before the autumn term began. The heavens were purified, clear as 
a still mountainside lake, the moon a shy, ghostly virgin hanging limply 
in the sky. The air was sweet and the wind was peaceful, invoking the 
sensation of a gentle lover, stirring up the first rusty leaves gliding 
down. The grass looked like it was made out of a million individual 
shards of emerald, pliable and tender, each bursting with the 
jewel-blood of the earth, their aroma rising and spreading, dancing to 
welcome the team. But beauty can be lost on some people; they are 
tragically doomed never to see anything past their own nose.

&quot;See? Look at where your bitching brought us. We&#39;re early.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t force you to come along.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but it was the only way to stop all that harping.&quot; Lauren 
Ofdensen sighed, stuck her hands in her pockets, and wandered off, 
muttering to herself and kicking the grass. Arina, who was really no 
more stable than her companion, sought out the benches and sat 
patiently, taking out a compact and making sure she was presentable. 
They came thirty minutes early; not even the Coach and her assistant had 
made it yet. Lauren eventually got tired of marching around, and 
swaggered back to her rival.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m gonna go find something to eat. You want anything?&quot;

&quot;Your treat?&quot;

&quot;Shit no! Do I look like fucking Fort Knox? Fork over some cash first!&quot;

&quot;No thanks, I&#39;m not hungry.&quot; Lauren snorted and stumbled away.

&quot;Then why the hell&#39;d you ask if I was buying?&quot; Once she was satisfied 
with her appearance, Arina reached into her book bag and pulled out her 
Advanced Psychology textbook. Even though classes wouldn&#39;t start until 
tomorrow, she wanted to skim through it for a preview of the material. 
While she was reading, Leena and Kathlyn came by at last, along with 
Freya and her hangers-on. Arina ignored them until they called out to 
her.

&quot;Hello Arina! See, I told you I&#39;d remember her name!&quot;

&quot;Only because you talked to her over the phone.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t pout, I&#39;m just smart like that. You can put those bags over 
there.&quot; Maria and Shiki were hauling two large sacks each; they placed 
them next to the bench, and Arina couldn&#39;t help but inquire.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Your uniforms,&quot; Maria said. &quot;I finally finished them, so I&#39;ll be giving 
them out now. We made three pairs for each of you, and I can always make 
more if you need them.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thanks. Could I see them now?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re supposed to wait until everybody gets here,&quot; Shiki said- just as 
Freya was pawing through the bags.

&quot;So which one is mine again?&quot;

&quot;Milady, didn&#39;t you hear what I just said?&quot; Shiki gently pulled her 
mistress away and chastised her in private. Arina rolled her eyes and 
marked her place.

&quot;Why would she need a uniform anyway? Won&#39;t our illustrious manager be 
exempt?&quot;

&quot;From the games, yes,&quot; Freya answered, &quot;but I&#39;d still like to represent 
our team.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me I have a uniform in there somewhere!&quot; Kathlyn exclaimed.

&quot;No, don&#39;t worry,&quot; Maria smiled. &quot;Staff members are the ones with 
exemptions. Besides, I never got your measurements.&quot;

&quot;Um, that really doesn&#39;t make any sense, but I guess I&#39;m okay with 
that.&quot; Leena checked her watch and noted that the meeting would start in 
fifteen minutes, so she and the staff began setting up. Lauren came back 
while they were working, and she had Elisa, Valencia, and Jennifer in 
tow.

&quot;So you guys are going to O and A later on? Cool! Mind if I tag along?&quot;

&quot;Sure, everybody&#39;s invited! How about it, Coach? Feel like celebrating 
the last day of freedom with us?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;m probably too old for that sort of thing 
anyway.&quot;

&quot;Not from where I&#39;m standing you&#39;re not,&quot; Valencia said in awe. Leena 
smiled but let her flattery slide. Fausta came next, a calm aura 
surrounding her as she prepared for what was inevitably a revelation. 
She also looked like she was ready to begin intensive practice, but then 
again, she always looked like that. In spite of her arrogance and 
ruthlessness (or perhaps because of them), Fausta&#39;s devotion was solid. 
Lauren grumbled about how &quot;all the fun had left the room&quot; when she 
arrived.

&quot;So just sit on the sidelines and sulk,&quot; Jen muttered. &quot;We already have 
a perfectly good goalie right here.&quot; She nudged Valencia and winked, and 
the Hispanic woman winked back.

&quot;Are we flirtin&#39; with each othah already? Ya don&#39;t waste time, do ya?&quot; 
Shannon waved at them as she stepped onto the field, Kasumi following on 
her bike. &quot;Say, can any o&#39; you gals do me a lahge favah? I got a double 
and I won&#39;t be able to affoahd the whole rent for much longah, so I was 
wonderin&#39; if any o&#39; you knew of somebody I could room with. It&#39;s big 
enough for two, and the rent ain&#39;t bad if we split it.&quot;

&quot;Dude, it would be totally copacetic if I could split a bill with you,&quot; 
Lauren said. Shannon took one look at her and turned her nose up; Arina 
began whistling the theme song to The Odd Couple. &quot;Aww, for crying out 
loud, why not? I&#39;m not a slob or nothing!&quot;

&quot;But you are a rampant diesel dyke,&quot; Arina pointed out.

&quot;And proud of it, but what&#39;s that got to do with anything?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rathah have a less flamboyant roommate if it&#39;s all the same to 
you,&quot; Shannon muttered. Lauren grumbled and rubbed her neck; Fausta 
stepped up and made a slightly better offer.

&quot;I know for a fact that Elisa&#39;s been looking for a place. You&#39;d be 
hard-pressed to find a steadier and more reliable roommate, and she&#39;s 
meticulous about rent.&quot; Fausta smiled at her friend, who was blushing 
very prettily.

&quot;Um, well, it&#39;s true that I&#39;d like to be able to split the living cost 
for a change...um, if that&#39;s okay with you. I mean, I&#39;m not particularly 
tidy, but I&#39;ll always pitch in for my share of everything, and I promise 
I won&#39;t be a bother.&quot; Shannon grinned and slapped her back roughly, 
rougher than Fausta or Lauren, and shook her hand.

&quot;Well, ya sound good enough to me! Long as you got a good job and don&#39;t 
play no loud music past midnight, you got&#39;cha self a deal! But let&#39;s 
talk about it latah, okay?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Terra came in later, waving to Fausta, and Amy followed, still 
wearing her kenpo gi. Freya waved politely to her, but remembered to 
stay emotionally distant. She liked Amy, but she couldn&#39;t be anything 
more than a friend; her heart had already been reserved. She dreaded 
hurting Amy&#39;s feelings, so she decided to keep a barrier between them, 
hoping that the taller woman would get the hint and move on. Freya was 
very experienced in this matter, since Amy was hardly the first person 
to be infatuated by her; she had broken many hearts before. Shiki cast 
Nguyen a sharp glance, but turned away and resumed her work.

&quot;Yikes,&quot; Maria muttered under her breath, &quot;what&#39;s got Araya-chan so 
pissed off?&quot; Another woman made her grand entrance several minutes 
later, but not many people recognized her. They couldn&#39;t help but stare 
as she laid her purse on the ground, poised on the bench, and crossed 
her legs, studying everything around her with frigid eyes.

&quot;Ah, you must be Fleur!&quot; Freya exclaimed as she approached the newcomer. 
&quot;I&#39;m so glad you came! I apologize for calling you at the last minute- &quot;

&quot;Cut the crap,&quot; she drawled lazily. &quot;You weren&#39;t the one who called me, 
and besides, I didn&#39;t expect to be treated specially. I am a last-minute 
addition, after all. Well, I&#39;d say this little get-together is just 
about ready to start. Oh,&quot; she said after noticing everyone staring at 
her, &quot;that&#39;s right, most of you don&#39;t know who I am. Fleur Lacroix, your 
newest player. I&#39;ll learn the rest of your names on my own.&quot;

&quot;You certainly know how to draw attention to yourself,&quot; Arina commented. 
Fleur&#39;s smile was like a knife; her eyes glittered with sharp frost. Two 
more people came onto the field before long, both of them rather tall 
for women, but one was particularly outstanding. Everybody recognized 
Alice thanks to her unusual physical trait; this made the poor girl feel 
exposed, but nobody glared at her like she was a monster, even though 
she believed they did. The other woman was totally unfamiliar; not even 
Leena knew her. Fleur had to do the honors, as she was the least 
perplexed by this sudden appearance.

&quot;I thought you weren&#39;t trying out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not. This emergency meeting of yours interrupted a very steamy date 
I was on.&quot;

&quot;The meeting wasn&#39;t my idea,&quot; Fleur countered with silken bitterness. 
The other woman chuckled quietly.

&quot;I believe you, but is that jealousy I see?&quot;

&quot;Of course. What&#39;s a beauty like that doing with a beast like you?&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d like her,&quot; she grinned, casting a seductive eye on 
Alice. &quot;She is your type, after all.&quot;

&quot;Since you&#39;re not signing up, quit wasting time and tell us what you&#39;re 
doing here,&quot; Fausta demanded coldly. Rain stepped back and glanced at 
her in offense.

&quot;Well! Don&#39;t you ladies have a prima donna with you!&quot;

&quot;I am afraid to say that she&#39;s always like that,&quot; Elisa sighed. 
&quot;However, I do think the rest of us would like to know who you are, at 
least.&quot;

&quot;Seems fair,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;I was the bane of this past weekend. The 
name&#39;s Rain Howlet, and as for my business, I&#39;m here working as a spy 
for Chairman Fitzgerald. He sent me here to determine if the team has 
any flaws which he can exploit.&quot;

&quot;Bullshit,&quot; Lauren groaned. Rain laughed.

&quot;Exactly! Very astute! But seriously, I&#39;m here so my date doesn&#39;t run 
off with someone else- and I would like to see what all the fuss is 
about. Just consider me your first fan.&quot;

&quot;She said with mounting sarcasm,&quot; Fleur smirked. Leena shrugged.

&quot;I don&#39;t have any problem with spectators, and you can go ahead and spy 
for all I know: I&#39;ve got nothing to hide. It does seem we&#39;re missing 
some people, though.&quot;

&quot;Felicity and Nadia,&quot; Kathlyn reported, glancing at the roster she had 
drawn up. &quot;They said they&#39;d be here as soon as they could when I called 
them, but they&#39;re probably being held up. It&#39;s the busy hour for the 
Lily Club, and I don&#39;t think even Gardenia would let them go. Not for 
long, anyway. We might have to cut the meeting short.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s bad,&quot; Leena murmured ominously. &quot;I had planned on getting some 
practice in. If worse comes to worse, though, I guess somebody here can 
make sure they keep up with us.&quot;

&quot;I can do that,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;Felicity&#39;s my roommate.&quot;

&quot;Oh, great! And hey, here they come, unless I&#39;m mistaken.&quot; Two figures 
were seen running up to meet them, pale and frantic and only a few 
minutes late. Kathlyn smiled at them and marked their names off: the 
entire team had finally assembled.

&quot;Sorry we&#39;re late!&quot; Velur gasped. &quot;Gardenia had to find people to take 
our shifts.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay; it&#39;s my fault for calling everyone during such a busy time. 
I&#39;m afraid, however, that you may not get an opportunity to resume your 
activities for several hours.&quot;

&quot;What the hell! Why not?!&quot; several women whined.

&quot;It relates to the news I called you all here for,&quot; Leena said. 
&quot;Chairman Fitzgerald has apparently thrown a gauntlet down and issued 
the teams a challenge. He proposed that we participate in three practice 
games sometime around the end of the month, and if we cannot win at 
least two of these matches, we&#39;ll be forcibly disbanded and the athletic 
program will be canceled.&quot;

&quot;He can&#39;t do that! What gives him the right? But that&#39;s only a few weeks 
away! Didn&#39;t the Dean fight him on this? What is this crap?&quot; Many of the 
girls protested; only a few remained silent, and fewer still- Rain and 
Fausta in particular- understood why the Chairman made such a 
proposition. Leena held up her hand and blew a whistle, silencing 
everyone.

&quot;I understand your frustration, but let me explain. Rosewood didn&#39;t 
fight this because she knew how necessary it was, and as heartless as it 
may seem, I have to agree with them both. We need something to test 
ourselves against, a real goal to aim for, and there&#39;s no sense in 
dragging our feet. If we can&#39;t get our act together and prove the 
Chairman wrong by the end of this month, then this team has no right to 
exist.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m listening to this bullshit!&quot; Lauren exclaimed.

&quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re not intelligent enough to grasp its concept,&quot; 
Fausta muttered.

&quot;Hey, shut the fuck up, ghibli! How come you&#39;re so fucking calm when 
they&#39;re throwing this shit in our face?&quot;

&quot;Because I agree as well. Just look at yourself, Ofdensen: you&#39;re the 
only one here that&#39;s upset.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, cuz&#39; I&#39;m the only one that thinks this shit&#39;s unfair!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not the only one,&quot; Jen grumbled as she crossed her arms. &quot;I know 
that we need to play against a real team in the future, but by the end 
of this month?&quot;

&quot;It would be quite feasible if you all stopped complaining and started 
practicing,&quot; Fleur replied crisply. She glared at Jen and Lauren with 
poisonous eyes, and smiled. &quot;This is survival of the fittest here. If 
you want to give up before you even try, then you&#39;re very free to leave 
the team. I think we have a good chance.&quot;

&quot;Not me,&quot; Terra sighed. &quot;And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair for you to assume 
we&#39;re all in agreement. Looks like the team&#39;s split in two.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, see? This stuff&#39;s retarded.&quot;

&quot;Then do something about it or leave,&quot; Fausta said as she stood up. She 
walked over to the sacks that Maria and Shiki had hauled in. &quot;Our 
uniforms are in here, right? I&#39;d like to have mine now, if you don&#39;t 
mind. Two weeks isn&#39;t much time, so I&#39;d like to get started.&quot;

&quot;Same heah,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;I ain&#39;t gonna sit around on my ass! Let&#39;s 
get to work!&quot; Freya knelt down and fished through the bags, sorting out 
uniforms and handing them out to her teammates. Maria did a great job 
with them: the shirts were beautifully light yet durable, with 
microscopic holes woven in for ventilation, and they shimmered like a 
river in the morning, dyed silver with a navy blue number on the front 
and the player&#39;s name on the back. They also had cleats, shorts, socks, 
sports bras, and shin guards to match; Lauren and Valencia even got 
their own pair of keeper&#39;s gloves.

&quot;There&#39;s a locker room in the gym,&quot; Felicity said as she headed there. 
Shiki suddenly remembered that Fleur didn&#39;t have a nametag erected yet, 
so she rushed over as fast as she could, startling many others.

&quot;She&#39;s showing unusual enthusiasm,&quot; Freya noticed.

 

- Elisa Berkeley, DOB: Oct. 15, Libra, left midfielder/reserve-

 

While the players were changing, Shannon secluded herself in a bathroom 
stall, preferring to dress in private. This had been a habit of hers 
since last year in middle school, when puberty struck the hardest and 
people changed the most. In high school, this became even more evident 
when a few of her friends started using their time in the locker room to 
do more than chatter and change outfits: they started necking, petting, 
even experimenting with oral sex. That was all fine and dandy so long as 
Shannon wasn&#39;t around to have it thrown in her face, so in order to 
avoid the disgust or the preaching it would produce, she simply had 
nothing to do with it. She didn&#39;t think any of her contemporaries would 
be so bold the first time around, but it was better to play it safe.

Fausta, meanwhile, was glad that the fighting had stopped, at least for 
awhile. She wasn&#39;t so heartless as to completely feel alienated from the 
team&#39;s indignation- it did seem a little unfair that they had to be 
tested so quickly- but this was a matter of strength and ability, of 
earning the privilege to play, the final sieve that would weed out all 
unnecessary elements. If they were given a month to write a seven-page 
essay, everyone would slack off, but if the deadline was in four days, 
everyone would work hard so they could finish. There was no room in the 
team for slobs, procrastinators, the lazy, the apathetic, or the 
amateur: everyone had to take this seriously or it would crumble like a 
house made out of straw.

&quot;Where iz angry kittiez going?&quot; Nadia said suddenly. Felicity was 
leaving the locker room with her uniform in tow.

&quot;I&#39;m going to change in private.&quot;

&quot;Why? Nobody haz germ. Iz kitty afraid of going naked for us?&quot;

&quot;Never mind,&quot; she grumbled. Nadia blinked in confusion and tried 
following her, but Felicity hid inside a bathroom stall, two away from 
Shannon&#39;s.

&quot;Mind your business, Nadia,&quot; Elisa said gently as she touched her 
shoulder. &quot;If she wants to dress in private, that&#39;s her decision.&quot;

&quot;Besides,&quot; Valencia smiled, &quot;I think you&#39;ve got enough to ogle around 
here.&quot; She grinned at Jen, who was wearing red panties, and bumped their 
butts together, causing the other woman to jerk in surprise. A few bold 
others followed her example: Rain brushed her fingers against Alice&#39;s 
bra, Lauren poked Terra&#39;s abdomen, and Freya temporarily broke her 
chastity as she groped Nadia from behind, pulling her back into the 
fold.

&quot;Now I&#39;m glad I hid somewhere,&quot; Shannon sighed with relief as the noise 
increased. Felicity could not agree.

I wish I was there with them. I wonder if anybody would do that to me...

&quot;Right, Felicity?!&quot; Shannon chirped. Velur swallowed nervously.

&quot;Sure, who needs distractions like that?&quot; She finished changing- the 
uniform fit her perfectly, smooth as silk yet as tough as leather- and 
left the bathroom in a hurry, running the gauntlet of lesbian 
flirtation.

&quot;Velur!&quot; Nadia squeaked at her.

&quot;What&#39;s your hurry, kitty?&quot; Valencia called. She was out the door before 
she could answer, and Fausta went with her.

&quot;We should follow her example,&quot; she stated. &quot;This is no time to be 
fooling around. Come with me if you want to win.&quot;

&quot;Like Terminator!&quot; Nadia exclaimed. Kasumi smiled and followed her, 
along with a few other hardcore players.

&quot;She is kind of a bitch, but I have to agree with her, too. Still, I 
wish she&#39;d take that stick out of her ass.&quot; Shannon soon filed past the 
throng of half-dressed ladies, an expression of fiery determination and 
supreme confidence on her face. She looked more like a warrior preparing 
for battle than a soccer player.

 

- Fausta Nazario, DOB: Sept. 18, Virgo, sweeper-

 

&quot;This&#39;ll be fun,&quot; Rain crowed as she rocked on the bleachers next to 
Maria and Kathlyn. Even though she only knew two of the players, she had 
gotten a strong impression from the others, and if that squabble was any 
indication of their chemistry together, it would certainly be worth 
sacrificing her date to watch them practice. Oh, she had no doubt that 
they would perform well, but skill is only part of the game: knowing 
your opponent and your fellow players was just as important. The girls 
looked good in their uniforms- some sexy, others cute- even Alice was a 
little more relaxed. In spite of her eccentricities, Maria was an 
excellent designer.

&quot;I was hoping we&#39;d get these designs,&quot; Valencia said as she flapped her 
shirt.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you like them! You all look great!&quot;

&quot;Okay, enough of this Madison Avenue crap,&quot; Jen said as she picked a 
ball up. &quot;Let&#39;s get some practice time in. We&#39;ll probably have to do 
this every single day until the end of the month if we want to win.&quot;

&quot;Are you serious?&quot; Lauren groaned. She looked to Terra and Amy, who were 
performing stretches. Even Alice was warming up; everybody was taking 
this challenge seriously, except for her. &quot;Oh, hell,&quot; she grumbled, 
&quot;what&#39;ve I gotten myself into? Shit. Here, throw me that ball, Jen! I 
may as well get in on it too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re supposed to kick it, not throw it!&quot; Rain shouted.

&quot;Spectators should be quiet,&quot; Shiki murmured, glaring at her. Suddenly, 
Freya jumped up and waved a homemade flag.

&quot;Go get em&#39;, everybody! Let&#39;s kick some ass out there! We&#39;ll show 
everyone what we&#39;re made of!&quot; Araya groaned and covered her face in 
shame.

&quot;Oh, milady, honestly...&quot; Even though everybody&#39;s expectation for their 
very first practice session together as a team was low, they did their 
best and put some serious effort into it. The veterans dominated the 
field during the whole run, but a few of the newcomers managed to slip 
in and have a go at it as well. Leena supervised their plays carefully, 
making notes and offering suggestions, with Freya and Rain cheering and 
Kathlyn on hand with water bottles. Everybody worked up a heavy sweat 
over the next three hours, but some women were naturally more soaked 
than others. Alice felt worn-out but exhilarated after running around 
with everyone, and she even managed to pull Rain in for a few &quot;pretend&quot; 
kicks and passes.

&quot;What an athlete!&quot; Kathlyn exclaimed as she watched the fencer perform. 
Rain didn&#39;t know the first thing about soccer, but her quick reflexes 
and graceful agility transferred well, and she even managed to keep up 
with the vets. Leena couldn&#39;t help but agree- it was too bad Rain had no 
intention of ever joining them. She would&#39;ve made a terrific left 
midfielder. Even so...

&quot;Is that a spot of drool I see?&quot; she teased. Kathlyn wiped her mouth and 
giggled.

&quot;Now Coach, you know I don&#39;t go for younger women!&quot;

&quot;Is that a fact?&quot; she smiled, humming to herself. Kathlyn scooted a 
little closer as she watched her wife take more notes.

&quot;What&#39;cha writing there?&quot;

&quot;Just some observations. Rain&#39;s quite an excellent player. I can see why 
Fitzgerald would keel over if she were serious about switching. He&#39;s got 
one heck of a fencer on his team.&quot;

&quot;Who does?&quot; Freya asked.

&quot;Never mind. You know, Miss Hohenheim, you&#39;re free to walk around the 
field and catch stray balls if you&#39;d like. I&#39;d hate to see you just 
sitting there all day not exercising.&quot;

&quot;Milady is very frail and cannot exert herself for more than- &quot;

&quot;I suppose I could take a look around and cheer for them from other 
angles,&quot; she said, jumping up from the bench and trotting around slowly. 
Shiki stared with an open mouth and rushed to her mistress&#39;s side.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t she ever listen?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Freya for you!&quot; Maria laughed. She smiled sweetly as her best 
friend and lover stretched her legs; she always had believed that what 
Freya needed more than anything else was a moderate workout. She managed 
to circle the entire field twice (retrieving five balls in the process) 
before practice ended and fifteen sweaty women rushed to the locker room 
to wash up. Not everyone took a shower together, of course: Shannon 
predictably waited until everyone was finished before claiming a stall 
for her own, and Felicity went straight home, but not before a disrobing 
Nadia invited her to go to the nightclub with everyone.

&quot;Which nightclub?&quot;

&quot;Iz called Out and About. I think iz Sappho place. Will kitty be going 
with us later?&quot;

&quot;Of course not!&quot; she stated as she put her accessories in a duffel bag. 
&quot;For one, I&#39;m not...I&#39;m not into that sort of thing. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s 
for me.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be gay to go there,&quot; Lauren said. &quot;I got a lot of 
straight friends that pop in all the time, like Arina over there. You 
should at least check it out once.&quot;

&quot;No thank you,&quot; she huffed. &quot;Besides, classes start tomorrow and I can&#39;t 
stay out late.&quot;

&quot;Aww, come on, iz not going to be having fun without Velur.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ll have a lot more fun without me,&quot; she said sharply.

&quot;But iz No Top Tuzeday, da?&quot;

&quot;I almost forgot about that,&quot; Fleur said. She gave Felicity a smoldering 
grin and purred, &quot;Tuesdays, we get to take our shirts off and dance 
around.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the main reason we&#39;re heading there,&quot; Valencia said. Nadia 
grinned cutely.

&quot;Da, bouncy-bouncy, bouncy-bouncy!&quot;

&quot;NO,&quot; Felicity growled. She took a deep breath and closed her locker. 
&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what: I&#39;ll go if the vote&#39;s unanimous.&quot;

&quot;I guess yah doomed, then,&quot; Shannon said. &quot;I ain&#39;t going eithah. Gay 
nightclubs ain&#39;t my thing.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m passing this time as well,&quot; Arina murmured, to Lauren&#39;s 
disappointment.

&quot;Uhh, and I probably won&#39;t be very comfortable, either,&quot; Terra muttered. 
Amy nodded.

&quot;S-same here.&quot;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; Lauren grumbled. &quot;I thought more people would be into it! 
Jeebus, what a letdown! Come on, Essylt, just this one time! I swear I 
won&#39;t take my shirt off.&quot;

&quot;Liar,&quot; she giggled darkly. &quot;I actually have an early class tomorrow, so 
I&#39;m going to bed soon. If you&#39;re set on placing your desires before your 
duties, don&#39;t come whining to me later.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, I won&#39;t,&quot; she groaned. Alice decided to go, since Rain was 
going to be there, and even though Fausta had early classes as well, she 
figured a few hours of fun wouldn&#39;t do any harm. Out and About was right 
up her alley, actually, and she even convinced Freya to come along.

&quot;I would like to see what it&#39;s all about,&quot; she remarked. The girls that 
wanted to all headed into the showers together, whereas the others left 
for home, never to be seen until the next day. For the sake of privacy, 
there were shoulder-high partitions separating each booth, and a small 
curtain to keep the water from spraying everywhere, but a stray eye 
could still take an appraising peek at their neighbors- whether to 
measure up potential rivals, or- in some cases- to examine the flesh for 
more lustful purposes. Fleur, Freya, Elisa, and Jenifer minded their own 
business, but the others glanced around, risking exposure as they stared 
at their teammates. Alice, for all her reservations, was really a 
lesbian at heart, and she enjoyed looking around, thankful of the 
advantage her height gave her. But with delight also came jealousy: many 
of her comrades had strong, graceful, athletic bodies; they were all in 
better shape (and better-tanned) than her. Even Elisa and Jennifer 
looked like they could run circles around her, and while Freya would be 
no match for her, her beauty was dazzling, and it pained Alice to look 
at her. She felt something sharp strike her rear end as she was peeking 
around, and jumped with a start. Two arms enveloped her from behind as 
another naked body joined her in the shower.

&quot;You&#39;re not a member of the team,&quot; she heard Fleur scoff.

&quot;I know, but I couldn&#39;t resist. Besides, I wanted to get nice and clean 
for our date.&quot; Fleur laughed.

&quot;It&#39;s not like you to be so bold.&quot;

&quot;What can I say, I like her.&quot; Alice felt Rain&#39;s hands touch her breasts- 
it was definitely Rain, brazen and carnal, the one person Alice had 
wished for more than any other- she submitted to the tender caresses and 
slowly lost the strength in her legs.

&quot;Is this a preview of things to come?&quot; Valencia grinned, glancing at 
Jen. Her date shrugged, unconcerned. Kasumi, meanwhile, had 
inadvertently let her eyes rest on Nadia Khovansky. She was very skinny, 
almost wiry, her breasts no bigger than oranges, and there was a 
scattered scar on her left pelvic area, but she had a very feminine and 
cheerful face, which is what drew Kasumi to her in the first place. Her 
hair was like honey, thick and golden-brown, wrapped around her 
shoulders now that she had untied her ponytail. Nadia noticed Kasumi 
staring, and shot a frisky smile.

&quot;Doez Kazoome want something?&quot;

&quot;Um, no,&quot; she muttered, shrinking away. &quot;But you know, if we&#39;re going to 
Out and About later today, maybe I can get us some kind of discount.&quot;

&quot;Why, do you work there or something?&quot; Lauren said.

&quot;Yeah. I just started, though, so I may not get any benefits.&quot; The 
redhead shrugged.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t hurt to check.&quot; Nadia leaned over the partition and beamed at 
Kasumi in admiration.

&quot;Kazoome awesome, get us inside with very fast! So what iz the Sappho 
place being like?&quot;

&quot;I just work with inventory and finances,&quot; she replied. &quot;I&#39;ve never 
actually been on the floor for more than a few seconds. It&#39;s loud, 
though: I can say that much.&quot;

&quot;Very many sexiez?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, c&#39;mon, tell us about the sexies!&quot; Valencia laughed. Kasumi rolled 
her eyes and got out: she was clean enough.

&quot;How am I supposed to know? Find out for yourself. But watch out for 
Odessa: she&#39;s a pretty big flirt.&quot;

&quot;Ah, did you have to learn that the hard way?&quot; Rain asked, briefly 
pulling away from her activities. Kasumi huffed.

&quot;It&#39;s none of your business.&quot; She dried off and went to change into her 
normal clothes, leaving Rain disappointed.

&quot;Hmm, she&#39;s kind of a cunt. And speaking of which...&quot;

&quot;I was wondering when you&#39;d come back!&quot; Alice squealed.

 

- Felicity Velur, DOB: June 21st, Gemini, forward-

 

Topless Tuesdays at the Out and About was precisely what you&#39;d expect, 
but it wasn&#39;t completely populated with half-naked horny lesbians; in 
fact, there was as much variety in their lack of clothing as there was 
in the attendance. There were plenty of women who chose simply to go as 
they were, leaving everything on save their shoes and socks; Elisa and 
Jennifer were with them, quite content to go dancing barefoot. Valencia, 
however, unbuttoned her shirt as soon as she passed through the front 
door; she wasn&#39;t wearing a thing underneath, which made her date blush.

&quot;What happened, did you forget your bra?&quot; she yelled.

&quot;No!&quot; Valencia replied. &quot;I dressed like this on purpose. I think it&#39;s 
sexier than just going topless.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. Uh, well, I guess that&#39;s okay if you like!&quot; The outgoing 
Hispanic woman laughed and enticed Jennifer close, where they danced and 
flirted. Freya laughed and unbuttoned hers as well; her ovular breasts 
swung hypnotically as Shiki and Maria sandwiched her between them, each 
sliding towards a state of undress. Fleur was a little more 
conservative, and only popped a few buttons; her bra was just barely 
visible as she hung out in the corner, ordering drinks with a fake ID. 
She was hardly the sexual creature she pretended to be around Rain and a 
select few others- in fact, sex disgusted her a little. But it was only 
human nature to crave pleasure, and according to Fleur&#39;s outlook, it 
would be pointless to deny that- both the fact and the action. If 
somebody really looked like they wanted to fuck her, it was better just 
to get it over with than keep teasing them. Thankfully, everyone had 
something more enticing to look at, and she was left alone for the most 
part- also an expected occurrence.

Nadia let out a whoop the moment she stepped through, and whipped her 
shirt off in a flash. She first sidled next to Elisa, her &quot;date&quot; for the 
next two days, and nudged her in the ribs as she seductively slipped her 
brassiere off. Elisa smiled palely, nudged her back, and felt her face 
go hot as Nadia&#39;s beautiful naked chest swung and gyrated; she even 
whipped her golden ponytail around, swishing the blood around her head 
until she went dizzy. Elisa was just coming to understand that she was 
attracted to spirited girls like Nadia- because they were so wild, free, 
uninhibited, and open with themselves, so very un-Elisan- but she also 
needed somebody older and more stable in her life, someone not quite so 
gay and giddy as this, an experienced woman who had seen the world and 
was smarter and stronger for it. Nadia was the life of the party, but 
Elisa needed someone who could be sober as well. She smiled at her date 
but refused to do anything risqu&eacute;.

&quot;Eleeza not having fun time?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really not my thing!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I am having fun, I&#39;d just 
prefer a quieter place!&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see what you mean. Iz okay by me! I go dance with other sexies 
now. You must go have the fun!&quot; She said something encouraging in 
Russian and Elisa replied back, since she was fluent. Nadia lit up as 
she realized somebody actually understood her own language, and leaped 
out to hug her. Elisa was petrified, and lit up like a neon sign.

&quot;[Since when could you speak Russian?]&quot; Nadia squealed.

&quot;[It&#39;s just been a hobby of mine,]&quot; Elisa replied meekly. &quot;[We should 
talk later when we can actually hear each other!]&quot;

&quot;[Oh yes, the noise. It&#39;s pretty obnoxious, no? But I guess nightclubs 
have to be this loud.]&quot;

&quot;[I wouldn&#39;t know. Anyway, you go have some fun. I&#39;m going to the 
ladies&#39; room.]&quot;

&quot;[All right, see you later. But don&#39;t stop having fun, okay?]&quot;

Kasumi eventually became the next object of Nadia&#39;s attention, and when 
they met, they smiled at each other like two silly toddlers. Beckett had 
actually been looking out for Odessa, who was no doubt clubbing with 
everyone else, probably wearing a pair of shorts and nothing else. She 
was relieved that her boss never made a pass at her, but only so far: no 
telling what the future would bring. When Nadia approached her, 
half-naked and bouncing with energy, Kasumi laughed and blushed. She had 
unbuttoned her top and had her bra exposed; she felt sexy and powerful 
for the first time ever, and was glad to be so open about it. Normally, 
she would be shy about her physique, especially around other girls, but 
the move from DC to Carnegie had changed her life. She had wanted to go 
here, not only to have fun and &quot;see what it was like&quot;, but to share in 
her sexuality with other women: she wanted to be herself for once. Nadia 
smiled and winked at her.

&quot;Kazoome very sexy today.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. You&#39;re looking pretty hot yourself!&quot;

&quot;Iz why I took shirt off, silly!&quot; she laughed. Kasumi laughed as well; 
she never thought of it that way.

&quot;Makes sense. Uh, hey, Nadia...&quot;

&quot;Kazoome want dance?&quot; she said, smiling sweetly. Beckett blushed and 
grinned.

&quot;I&#39;d love to!&quot;

&quot;Banzai! Take top off also?&quot;

&quot;Not this time,&quot; she reprimanded playfully. Nadia stuck her tongue out, 
but that didn&#39;t matter: she could always try again next week.

Now if only Felicity were here, they both thought to themselves. Fausta 
had her shirt off the moment she stepped through the door, and her bra 
followed suit; she actually looked very comfortable walking around 
half-naked, and casually flirted with several women as if it were just 
another day. Lauren disrobed as well; she hadn&#39;t been wearing any 
undergarments at all. It was safe to say that the room got a little 
hotter after that, and when Rain began slow-dancing with Alice, both of 
them in their brassieres, sweat streaking down their silky skin, steam 
began to rise as the night grew long and the beat rolled on...
