<a href="../original/descent-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Sister Samantha Teresa, also known as Sam, hefted her
pistols calmly as they raced across the rooftops
towards the sounds of sirens. &quot;You ready?&quot; the brown
haired woman in priest&#39;s garb asked her partner
grimly.

Descent wasn&#39;t even trying to hide her demonic nature
tonight, the raven haired woman&#39;s beauty almost
inhuman as she followed Sam. &quot;No, to be honest,&quot; she
answered flatly, &quot;but there&#39;s no choice.&quot;

&quot;You could just leave it to me and Aileen,&quot; Sam
pointed out as they leapt the gap between two
buildings, the faint scent of smoke in the air.

&quot;They want me,&quot; Decent said grimly, her eyes glowing
red, &quot;and I won&#39;t have any more innocent deaths on my
conscience.&quot;

There was a crash of breaking glass and Sam called,
&quot;Incoming!&quot; even as the roof exploded into flames
around them.

Descent swiftly grabbed Sam in her strong arms even as
she focused her will, her back bulging a moment as she
swiftly grew leathery wings. With a sweep of those
powerful wings she gently carried them over the flames
and over to the next roof, dropping down to where a
young man waited for them calmly.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Pyre admitted.

&quot;Die,&quot; Sam fired fast, bullets hissing through the air
but Pyre was ready, dodging even as he tossed another
vial at the priest.

Descent shoved her backwards as the glass broke
against her back then screamed in pain as her wing
burst into flames, shining like some torch. Howling
her body shifted, trying to put the flame out, finally
managing it after half a minute or so. Pyre watched in
fascination, a erection obviously tenting the man&#39;s
pants.

&quot;Ha! First blood to....&quot; Pyre started to gloat when
there was a bark of a weapon then a bead of red
appeared on his forehead. He swayed, then dropped as
the bullet wound in his forehead finally registered.

&quot;Fool,&quot; Sam scowled as she put her gun back under her
priest&#39;s garb and hurried over to Descent&#39;s side. &quot;Are
you all right?&quot; she demanded, kneeling down to where
Descent was crouched on the ground.

&quot;Hurts like hell,&quot; Descent said flatly, &quot;I think there
was some Holy Water mixed in with whatever he hit me
with.&quot; She straightened up, biting back a groan,
&quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Sam said. She picked up the radio that Alex
Conner gave her and listened, &quot;Two women are reported
on the loose downtown... and there&#39;s chaos all over
though.&quot;

&quot;Diana put a bounty on us to draw out freelancers,&quot;
Descent said flatly, &quot;they&#39;re probably seizing the
chance, too.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s get to work,&quot; Sam said as she calmly
refilled her gun&#39;s clips.

In a small corner store nearby the cashier stepped
back from the till, raising her hands as the blonde
said, &quot;Please... I gave you all the money!&quot;

&quot;And I appreciate it,&quot; the well dressed young man
smiled, his black hair perfectly neat, &quot;but you&#39;ve
seen my face.&quot; He raised his pistol then stiffened,
&quot;Urk?&quot;

&quot;You okay?&quot; Descent asked the cashier as she calmly
let the boy&#39;s body drop to the floor, blood on her
clawed fingers.

&quot;Ye..yes,&quot; the woman stammered.

&quot;You&#39;d better close up,&quot; Sam called from where she
watched from the doorway, &quot;I doubt things are going to
get much safer.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; the blonde smiled weakly as she watched them
go. She looked down at the body and her eyes widened,
&quot;Does that mean I have to clean this up? Ewww!&quot;

&quot;Freeze!&quot; the police officer raised his gun as the two
women left the store, his black hair falling into his
eyes. His uniform gleamed but his eyes more than a
little wild as his hands shook just a bit with nerves.

&quot;No,&quot; Descent said, &quot;we&#39;re a bit busy.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; he blinked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry but we&#39;ve got a army of killers chasing
us,&quot; Sam explained, noticing that the young man seemed
to be a little less high strung when they talked,
&quot;once we take care of that we&#39;ll get back to you.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; he brought his pistol up once again.

&quot;Fuck,&quot; Descent swore as she leapt, moving with
inhuman speed.

&quot;Mommy,&quot; the officer squeaked out as the dark shape
descended on him then the world went black.

&quot;You didn&#39;t...&quot; Sam sounded alarmed.
&quot;He fainted,&quot; Descent said flatly. She dragged him
over to the corner store and banded on the door,
&quot;Hello!&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; the cashier unlocked the door, hefting her
attacker&#39;s gun.

&quot;I hate to ask,&quot; Descent gestured apologetically
towards the out cold cop, &quot;but I can&#39;t just leave him
on the street.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; the blonde nodded, dragging him in. &quot;Oh,&quot; she
smiled wryly, &quot;thank you for saving my life.&quot;

Descent smiled and shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s what I do.&quot;

&quot;I think you&#39;ve made another conquest,&quot; Sam said as
they walked away.

&quot;Don&#39;t start,&quot; Descent said with a sigh, seeing yet
another maniac coming.

&quot;Die!&quot; she cried, twin swords whirling in a complex
dance.

&quot;No,&quot; Sam capped her calmly, dropping the swords
wielding woman with a single shot.

&quot;Didn&#39;t I see Indiana Jones do that once?&quot; Descent
asked with gallows humor.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Sam checked her radio once again.
&quot;Multi-vehicle pile up in the fashion district,&quot; she
reported grimly, &quot;and someone&#39;s taking pot shots at
the rescue workers.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Descent said as they headed off.

Meanwhile Aileen watched her companion warily as they
charged the bar, the sounds of chaos within growing
louder. The redhead let Rosette go in first then
followed up with her guns blazing, killing the gang
members with no mercy. The owner lay in a bloody wreck
on the bar where one of the scum had been cutting him,
the others scattered about the place killing the
customers or waitresses.

&quot;God may forgive you,&quot; Rosette cried as she tossed a
cross, the end filed to a point, &quot;I will not!&quot; As the
man dropped, blood splattering she followed up with a
swing of the weighted rosary, sending him crashing to
the earth.

&quot;Oh god oh god oh...&quot; the waitress squealed fearfully
as Aileen leapt over the table she was hiding under.

&quot;Stay there,&quot; Aileen ordered the woman as she fired
once again, efficiently sending a third man to a early
grave.

&quot;Ashes to ashes, dust to dust,&quot; Rosette cast a powder
into another man&#39;s eyes, making him squeal in agony as
it burned. She kneed him in the balls then struck with
her rosary, drawing the heavy metal beads aside to
reveal the razor wire beneath.

&quot;No,&quot; Aileen put her hand on Rosette&#39;s arm to stop her
as she nodded towards the hysterically crying
waitresses who were all slowly emerging from their
concealment, looking at their two saviors in awe.

Rosette ground her teeth together but nodded, putting
on the rosary once more. &quot;The judgement of god awaits
you,&quot; she said as she swiped one of Aileen&#39;s pistols
and fired, splatting blood on the end of her robes.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; a young man wept weakly from nearby.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Aileen reclaimed her gun as she hurried
over to the badly wounded man laying on the bar.

&quot;Do you intend to put him out of his misery?&quot; Rosette
asked, looking at the bleeding man with a unholy
fascination.

&quot;Not the way you mean,&quot; Aileen said flatly, laying her
hands on him. Despite being expelled from the Knights
Templar she had never lost her faith...or the gifts
that faith granted. A soft glow danced around them as
Aileen prayed, the cuts and wounds that covered the
man fading, closing up in seconds.

Rosette crossed herself, for a moment actually looking
like a real nun. &quot;I forget at times that you are
touched by god,&quot; she confessed.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; Aileen said. The idea of this notoriously
unstable women around these innocents scared her,
honestly, and she wanted them out of here as soon as
possible.</pre>
