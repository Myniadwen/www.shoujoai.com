<a href="../original/allstars-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>August 25th, Saturday, Carnegie women&#39;s locker room

2:03 pm

 

The locker room was quickly overcome by screeching, squealing, spastic 
girls, jumping and waving and hugging and flinging their clothes off in 
victory. Hugs and kisses abounded with little restraint or thought; it 
was as if they had won a war and not a practice game. They certainly had 
reason to celebrate, but this frivolity was uncalled-for. Fausta too was 
happy, but she whistled loudly and got everyone to stop what they were 
doing.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Now before you all go and make complete asses 
of yourselves, just remember we still have two games left, and if you 
thought Laudendale was difficult, you&#39;re going to be in for a rude 
awakening. But by all means, take some time off and rest on your laurels 
if that&#39;s what you want. We&#39;ll lose, of course- and badly, might I add- 
but at least today&#39;s victory will be with us, even if the team is 
dissolved prematurely.&quot; She peeled off her sweaty underclothes and 
stepped into a shower, casual and indifferent under the cool spray.

&quot;Good God, woman, don&#39;t you ever chill out?&quot; Jen snorted.

&quot;We can &#39;chill out&#39; once we win another game. But I won&#39;t stop you.&quot; The 
celebrations ended frostily. Fausta&#39;s words stung everybody, and as 
painful and irritating as they were, they all knew she was right. She 
had good intentions, but she didn&#39;t have to be such a wrecker about it. 
Once the atmosphere became more solemn, Fleur was seen limping inside, a 
subtle twitch of pain on her face, Kathlyn supporting her. The doctor 
had given her a good diagnosis and said that as long as Fleur rested and 
didn&#39;t put any unnecessary strain on her foot, it would heal quickly. 
She would need a splint and a crutch, though, and probably wouldn&#39;t 
recover in time for the next game.

&quot;Do you need any help undressing?&quot; Kathlyn asked with sincere concern.

&quot;No thank you,&quot; Fleur replied bitterly. &quot;I&#39;m not a child, and I told you 
I&#39;ve had worse. If you&#39;re interested in me in that way, you&#39;ll just have 
to wait until later.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t flatter yourself,&quot; Kathlyn chuckled. &quot;If you&#39;re healthy enough to 
snap at me, then I suppose my services have ended. Uh, ladies, great 
game today! I&#39;ll be outside helping the Coach if you need me.&quot; She 
saluted and was on her way; Lauren ribbed Alice playfully.

&quot;Hey, she&#39;s pretty cute for an older girl, huh? And that tattoo of hers 
is wicked. She acts like a wallflower but I bet there&#39;s a wild side to 
her.&quot; Alice shrugged numbly; she was more concerned with Rain. It had 
taken everything she had not to punch Fitzgerald in the face for the way 
he treated her girlfriend. Because of this, she had not even smiled 
earlier. This caused Lauren some concern. &quot;Hey, Al, you okay? Oh shit, I 
totally forgot about Rain! Fuck, man, that sucks! I&#39;m sorry, Al. But 
maybe we can go see her later on.&quot;

&quot;Forget about it,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;Just leave me alone for awhile.&quot; She 
undressed and turned the shower as cold as it would go. This was her way 
of protecting Lauren: she couldn&#39;t bear the thought of lashing out at 
another good friend. Arina approached Fleur, half-dressed, and offered 
to help her in the shower.

&quot;I said I didn&#39;t need anybody&#39;s help. God, don&#39;t you people listen? And 
I especially don&#39;t want it from you. You&#39;ll probably just rub it in my 
face, you smug little ass!&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t going to do anything of the sort. I only do that with Lauren.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s true,&quot; she replied, flinging her sports bra off. Fleur snorted 
and, with great difficulty and some pains, undressed and hobbled into 
the shower. Arina watched her stubborn defiance with a faint smile of 
admiration.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you like that A-hole,&quot; Kasumi said in disgust. Arina 
shrugged.

&quot;What can I say, her tottering mental state fascinates me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank god!&quot; Lauren gushed. &quot;You only want her for her mind.&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;The Time Between&quot;

 

True to her word, once she was dressed and had left the locker room, 
Kasumi sought out Valencia and took her up on her earlier offer. &quot;You 
remember, right?&quot; she said with a silky smile. &quot;You asked me out on a 
date, and I said I would once we have the time.&quot;

&quot;And now we have the time,&quot; Valencia answered. &quot;So what would you like 
to do? I&#39;d like to go dancing somewhere if you don&#39;t have any ideas. Not 
at Out and About, I mean: real dancing.&quot;

&quot;Like...ballroom dancing?&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s your thing. I can teach you if you don&#39;t know how.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m actually pretty starved,&quot; Kasumi said, and her stomach groaned in 
accord. &quot;Could we go to lunch first, please?&quot;

&quot;It is around that time of day, and I guess we need a moment to get the 
pointless small-talk out of the way. I hope you&#39;re not thinking about 
fast food.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, no. I ate at Dairy Queen once and got sick as a dog. I&#39;m not 
lactose intolerant; I just can&#39;t eat that processed crap. Somewhere like 
Arby&#39;s and Subway is all right.&quot;

&quot;What about that Denny&#39;s a few blocks away? We could almost walk there.&quot;

&quot;Sounds great. Uh...you know, this will actually be my first date,&quot; she 
emphasized nervously. &quot;And not only that, but my first date with another 
woman. I&#39;m not exactly familiar with the protocol.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my first date too,&quot; Valencia smiled. &quot;I mean in America. You&#39;re 
probably only my fourth or fifth overall.&quot;

&quot;Jeez, I feel outclassed.&quot; Valencia laughed and offered to drive them; 
Kasumi preferred taking her bike. They parted and met again in front of 
the restaurant; Kasumi already knew what she wanted.

&quot;I&#39;m really craving some chicken fingers. Hey, uh, before we get into 
this- oh, uh, table for two, please.&quot; The restaurant was almost full of 
people, making it more difficult to find a table. Kasumi actually 
spotted Elisa, Nadia, and Svetlana secluded in a corner and waved at 
them. Apparently they all had the same idea.

&quot;You are finally being on date, Kazoome? Sugoi!&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah, you could say that. Anyway, I don&#39;t want to disturb your 
meal, so...&quot;

&quot;[Introduce us, Nadia!]&quot; Svetlana gestured. &quot;[Are these more romantic 
conquests of yours, or just friends?]&quot;

&quot;[Really, Nana, I&#39;m not a pervert heartbreaker like you. I&#39;m committed. 
This is Valencia and Kazoome- Ka...su...mi. They&#39;re on the team with 
us.] Kazoome, Valencia, this iz Nana Svetlana.&quot;

&quot;Yes, hello,&quot; she said, reaching out her hand. &quot;You...in game, 
fantastic!&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Valencia smiled. &quot;It was really hard.&quot;

&quot;Family also watching?&quot; Both ladies shook their heads. Elisa offered to 
interpret, and Nadia said they were more than welcome to join them, but 
Kasumi and Valencia refused: they preferred to spend the rest of the day 
in private.

&quot;[Let them do as lovers will,]&quot; Svetlana quipped. They didn&#39;t catch 
this, and Elisa and Nadia didn&#39;t feel like interpreting or correcting. 
Once the two women finally found their seats, Kasumi recalled her 
original train of thought.

&quot;Anyway, as I was saying, I wonder which of us will pay the bill. I 
mean- &quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s easy,&quot; Valencia waved. &quot;We split it. I pay for my food and 
you pay for yours.&quot;

&quot;You have done this before,&quot; Kasumi smiled. Valencia sat back proudly.

&quot;Far be it from me to impose outdated gender roles on us. It&#39;s much more 
fair this way.&quot;

&quot;I agree. So tell me about yourself.&quot; And so Valencia opened the 
floodgates, letting a considerable gush of information out as she 
explained her reason for being: her Spanish origins, her job as a 
fashion designer- one who never wore her own designs, no less- her 
social adaptability, her spontaneity, charisma, and flirtatiousness; the 
lawsuits she had filed against people; her newfound sexuality; her 
independence; a sister named Marina and a mentor named Adrien F&eacute;lix; 
playing the violin; physics and geometry, and the private schools she 
went to; passion and a love for romance; her defense for friends. She 
went on and Kasumi didn&#39;t dare interrupt. She was staring into another 
world; she was meeting alien life for the first time. Once Kasumi 
fancied herself a spectator, but now she was being chosen to 
participate; she was investing herself in another person.

&quot;Whew,&quot; Valencia said at the end. She excused herself to visit the 
bathroom: talking that much made her thirsty. Their food was already 
there when she returned. And what did Kasumi have to show for her years 
spent on this stage? Flak for her height, and her bosom; her split 
family, and her father&#39;s boxing, and the poverty she was subjected to, 
and the dreams she had, which were only recently being realized. She 
could sing well. She waxed poetic of the fights she got into. There was 
a romantic inside her. There was a brother Charlie whose birth defects 
put the Becketts in the red, and a mother she resented who left her 
husband for other women. She worked in a gay bar using a fake ID. She 
had been a breath away from being named Grace or Danielle, but was 
impulsively named after a waitress. She had never been in love and gave 
her virginity away like a cheap trinket after drinking too much. And she 
absolutely idolized Rocky Balboa.

Above all, the two women had a certain grace about them that allowed 
them to fake a good dancing skill once the time came. They soon became 
entranced with each other and realized that as opposite as they were, 
they had both been seeking a particular lover all of their lives, some 
figurehead who shone out brighter than the others in their most 
secretive dreams, and that it was entirely possible for their date to 
fit this hallowed description. They still refrained from kissing each 
other at the end- Valencia knew she would swoon and Kasumi knew she 
would not be able to control herself- but they were more than willing to 
wait for further opportunities.

 

- Jen Andre, 115 lbs (52.3 kg), English, defensive midfielder-

 

Due to her condition, Fleur was the last one to leave the locker room; 
even Shannon got finished with her shower sooner. As she struggled to 
put fresh clothes on, hissing and cringing whenever she so much as 
brushed against her sprain, she noticed Arina preening in front of a 
mirror, her narcissistic devotion almost religious. Although such 
meticulous attention to her appearance paid off- she was, admittedly, 
one of the prettiest women on the team- Fleur looked down on such 
obsession. She would have left the girl to herself were it not for 
academic obligations.

&quot;You are sure you don&#39;t need any help?&quot; Essylt asked with finality.

&quot;Positive. I&#39;m not a child, and you&#39;re hardly the kind of person I&#39;d 
trust to take care of me anyway.&quot;

&quot;I just needed to be sure,&quot; she murmured. Fleur twitched with anxiety as 
she watched Arina comb, re-comb, powder, plaster, wash, and massage her 
face. Soon even the subtlest actions became acutely irritating.

&quot;Look, it stinks in here, so hurry up.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not forcing you to stay here. I&#39;m just here because it&#39;s more 
private.&quot;

&quot;I mean about the psychology thing. I can&#39;t get it over with while 
you&#39;re standing there like a...a brainless peacock. Hurry up and let&#39;s 
go outside. Nobody gives a damn about your looks.&quot;

&quot;Calling myself Nobody would enhance the insignificance of my own 
existence,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Then it&#39;s settled: I am Nobody. But are we 
all not meaningless bits of matter wasting our energies on silly 
pursuits? The struggle for power and social status is a fool&#39;s game when 
compared to the vast potential of time, space, and nature. Humans wallow 
in their own base stupidity and fear leaving this world without giving 
proof that they were there. A wasted effort.&quot;

&quot;I completely agree,&quot; Fleur stated. &quot;Now are we getting out of here so 
we can finish this project or what?&quot;

&quot;Are you in a hurry?&quot; Arina said, breaking away from her meditation. The 
mirror would be lonely. &quot;If you&#39;re so enthusiastic about this, you may 
please wait outside. I&#39;m not finished here yet.&quot;

&quot;The sooner the better for me,&quot; she snorted. Arina finally gave up and 
abandoned her labors. Fleur was injured and in a bad mood, and she knew 
better than to test someone in that condition.

&quot;Fine, whatever makes you happy. I suppose I&#39;m presentable enough. 
Still, what an ugly girl.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t understand why you do it,&quot; Fleur muttered as she 
limped out. &quot;Lord knows I don&#39;t exactly hurry along in the morning. But 
there&#39;s a difference between caring and obsessing.&quot;

&quot;I thought you didn&#39;t care at all,&quot; Arina remarked, smiling wryly. Fleur 
made an indistinguishable face, something between aggravation and 
amusement.

&quot;I do have a reputation to uphold.&quot; Once they were in a better place- 
outdoors was as good as any, and now that everyone had left, they would 
have all the time and privacy in the world- Fleur got comfortable and 
cleared her voice. &quot;Fleur Victoire Lacroix, born November third, twenty 
years old, French. I bet you&#39;re wondering why I go for days at a time 
without eating- weeks even- then suddenly decide to bulk up for the 
games. The answer is simple: soccer and my social life are two different 
worlds, and I have no intention of mixing the two. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t 
bother proselytizing any of you to my cliques, nor do I expect my other 
hangers-on to attend the games. I suppose you could say I&#39;m dipping my 
toes in two worlds, but I like to keep the distinctions separated and 
sharp.

&quot;Basically, I&#39;m nothing more than a rich girl bored and jaded by the 
corruption and materialism of my upper class society. I believe human 
beings to be fundamentally evil, or at least utterly stupid, and since I 
think all displays of nobility and honor are pretentious, I set out to 
prove them so. By bullying and humiliating these people, I justify and 
reassure myself that nothing beautiful exists, and that nothing is 
admirable. Are you with me so far?&quot;

&quot;Quite,&quot; Arina replied. She looked like she was having the time of her 
life. Tottering mental state indeed!
&quot;All right, then. The presence of my teammates is something I accept 
with a sort of...resignation. I train and play with them, but I don&#39;t 
extend a gesture of friendship to anyone other than whom I deem worthy. 
People deserving my mutual respect are those who either share my social 
and financial ranking, such as Fausta, Elisa, Freya, and Valencia, or of 
similar personality, such as Rain and Alice. This might be a source of 
conflict,&quot; she added cattily, &quot;as people might not be willing to trust a 
right midfielder with an ego problem.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have a problem.&quot;

&quot;Even though I didn&#39;t mention you?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would,&quot; she smirked. Fleur laughed.

&quot;I&#39;ll put it into consideration. As for my love life, I&#39;d like to say 
I&#39;m asexual, and I just screw around with whoever I can manipulate, but 
I suppose I could go for someone as realistic as I myself. I mean, 
there&#39;s not going to be anyone stupid enough to &#39;love me as I am&#39; or 
&#39;stick with me through the end&#39;. That sort of nonsense doesn&#39;t happen in 
the real world. &#39;Love&#39; is just the word people use when they mean 
&#39;power&#39;. For example: I&#39;m stronger than you, so I can get away with it, 
or you&#39;re stronger than me, so I&#39;ll stick with you and leech out 
whatever I can. Still with me?&quot;

&quot;Enthralled,&quot; Arina said, her voice very pure.

&quot;Well then, maybe I should just go with guns blazing,&quot; she purred, 
bringing out her darkest secret: &quot;I&#39;ve been sexually abused by my father 
since I was 11, up until my previous school year, when my mother walked 
in on us. I don&#39;t think this abuse traumatized me; rather, it enabled me 
to open my eyes what people truly are, and at such a young age! The poor 
bastard gave me anything I wanted to keep me quiet, and I took it- abuse 
and privilege- very impassively. His incarceration was as emotional to 
me as a weather report in another country. Oh, on that note, I ousted my 
first best friend and lover from all social circles by blowing the 
whistle on her own incestuous activities. I thought I was in love with 
her, but now, I don&#39;t regret a thing. In short, there is no soft, gentle 
girl underneath my icy shell. My entire being is the icy shell.&quot;

Arina was half-crazed with wonder as she finished jotting everything 
down. She had never encountered a mind quite like Fleur&#39;s- so frank, so 
stoic, so nihilistic and perversely pleased- she was as attracted to it 
as you or I might be attracted to a portrait, or a symphony, or a film, 
or a favorite novel. The draw for her was not sexual in the slightest, 
but intellectual and incorporeal; it stoked a fire that had not been 
warm in ages.

&quot;Are we finished?&quot; she asked wearily. &quot;I have things to do. I hope I 
didn&#39;t disturb you too much, Arina dear.&quot;

&quot;On the contrary,&quot; she replied, almost giddy with excitement. &quot;I would 
like to hear more. Thank goodness we were put together.&quot;

&quot;It was the luck of the draw,&quot; Fleur resigned like a true Stoic. &quot;And we 
would&#39;ve done it eventually. Well, I will admit that I learned something 
fascinating, and I will also admit you&#39;re not half as bad as I pegged 
you to be. But that doesn&#39;t mean anything good.&quot;

&quot;Seems like a tentative respect.&quot; Fleur smiled faintly; that answer 
suited her.

 

- Valencia Durante, 132 lbs (60 kg), Spanish, goalie-

 

Felicity Velur looked horrible when she came into work the next day. Her 
eyes were wide and bleary, her hair unkempt and ragged, her clothes were 
disheveled, and her hands rattled; even her voice was a little off 
tempo. She put her work clothes on numbly, and mechanically started 
bussing tables, more dead than alive. Nadia and Gardenia noticed 
immediately, of course, but soon the other employees caught on, and even 
Robin and Odessa saw a change in her when they stopped by.

&quot;Is she okay?&quot; Odessa pointed. &quot;You&#39;re not overworking her, are you?&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Gardenia muttered. &quot;I gave her the day off yesterday. 
This is the first time she&#39;s worked in a week, ever since the team went 
into training.&quot;

&quot;Too much practice, then?&quot;

&quot;Well, that was my theory at first, and Nadia thinks so, too. I mean, 
they all worked hard, but from what I hear, Felicity always tries going 
the extra mile. I talked to her Coach once, and she swears she isn&#39;t 
forcing her to do this. She&#39;s just as concerned as I am.&quot;

&quot;So why does she push herself like that? Is it really that important to 
her?&quot;

&quot;See, this is why I never got into sports,&quot; Robin gestured. Gardenia 
stared impatiently.

&quot;Honey, that&#39;s not helping. There&#39;s obviously something wrong, but I 
can&#39;t get her to talk to me about it, and Nadia isn&#39;t having any luck, 
either. Normally I&#39;d say it&#39;s none of my business, but I can&#39;t sit by 
while someone I like does this to herself. Besides, it&#39;s affecting the 
way she works.&quot;

&quot;Then you need to perform an intervention. Maybe we should ask her 
friends on the team and her Coach to help us out.&quot;

&quot;Good idea. I&#39;ll let Nadia in on it. Could you ask your employees- uh, 
Terra and Fausta, right? And Odessa, you ask that, uh, Kasumi girl, 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Will do, but I think I might have a better idea.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Do you remember me telling you about that dealer that smuggled her 
goods into my place a few months ago? When I called the police, I was 
interviewed by this really weird woman. She got the job done, though. 
Impressed the hell out of me.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, I remember that. But do you think this justifies hiring a 
private detective?&quot;

&quot;You tell me,&quot; she said; &quot;you know her better than I do.&quot; Gardenia 
glanced back, watching as Nadia tried in vain to console her distraught 
friend. In spite of her standoffish nature, Kemper and Khovansky both 
cared about her, so there was definitely something there that was worth 
going through so much trouble.

&quot;Okay, no question about it. Let&#39;s just hope it&#39;s nothing disastrous. In 
the meantime, we&#39;ll set up that intervention.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll get right on it.&quot; Odessa left without her usual flirtation, 
an indication of how serious the situation had gotten. Once she was 
outside, she found a quiet place and dialed the number that detective 
had given her. She didn&#39;t know Felicity or her situation, but she was 
Gardenia&#39;s friend, and that was good enough for her.

A voice on the other end said, &quot;Taskforce Aegis, this is Kokoro 
speaking.&quot;

&quot;Hi, could you connect me to, uh...Detective Doyle, please?&quot;

&quot;Yes, one moment, please.&quot;

 

Agatha Doyle was playing Sudoku when she got a phone call on her company 
line. She wished she could give her professional number out to more 
people, but after that &quot;Bloodlust incident&quot;, her boss had been adamantly 
opposed. Oh well; this was nearly as effective, and Kokoro did a fairly 
good job of screening most of the prank calls.

&quot;Taskforce Aegis, Doyle&#39;s on the line!&quot;

&quot;Detective,&quot; she heard the other person say, &quot;you may not remember me, 
but a few months back, you interviewed me at a nightclub regarding a 
drug smuggler. Anyway, I- &quot;

&quot;No, I remember!&quot; she said, flipping through a notebook until she 
arrived at the corresponding case. &quot;Odessa Beill, owner of lesbian 
nightclub Out and About, famous for its Topless Tuesdays and- except for 
that particular incident- its clean record. The club is located on 59 
Gateway Boulevard, two miles from Carnegie University, but you live on 
2431 Golden Street, a good half-mile away. As I recall, the perpetrator 
was apprehended and charged, and she&#39;s currently serving time in...oh, 
drat, I didn&#39;t write that part down. That&#39;s not like me! Anyway, Miss 
Odessa, what can Aegis do for you today?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I&#39;d just like you to do something,&quot; she answered. Odessa was 
surprised that anybody could remember all those details, but then again, 
she was dealing with a detective. &quot;There&#39;s this friend of a friend who&#39;s 
having some problems, and we&#39;d like to know- &quot;

&quot;Well, we do have a psychologist on staff, but I&#39;m not sure if she&#39;ll go 
for it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that.&quot;

&quot;We also have a fairly competent medical unit, but again, it might be 
asking too much.&quot;

&quot;No, I...I called you, all right? I need your help looking into this!&quot;

&quot;No need to get impatient; I just want to make sure we&#39;re both clear on 
the matter. I&#39;m not a psychologist and I&#39;m not a doctor, so if it turned 
out she had those maladies... Anyway, I&#39;m wasting your time. You&#39;re 
basically asking me to poke around and see if I can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s 
causing these problems, right?&quot;

&quot;Right. I know it sounds a little underhanded...&quot;

&quot;Nonsense!&quot; she laughed. &quot;Happens to me all the time. Anyway, it might 
be fun to exercise my skills for a case like this. Normally my work 
involves some life-threatening matter. Uh, this isn&#39;t a matter of life 
and death, I hope?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m asking you to help us. I can&#39;t really pay you much- &quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; she groaned. &quot;I didn&#39;t get into this line of work for the 
money. Just promise to cover a few expenses, maybe treat me to lunch, 
and we&#39;ll call it even. I&#39;ll call you once I&#39;m on the road: do we meet 
in the same place as last time?&quot;

&quot;Uh, sure. You know where my office is, right?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh, past the throngs of dancing lesbians and up the elevator to the 
third floor. I&#39;ll see you then.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. I owe you one, Miss Doyle.&quot; They both hung up and Agatha jotted 
everything down on her pad. Then, wasting no time, she took her phone, 
her purse, and her Sherlock Holmes outfit (complete with monocle and 
bubble-pipe), and headed for her boss&#39;s office. She knocked once and was 
let in.

&quot;Hey, Miss Josephine! You got a minute? Listen, I&#39;ll get right to the 
point: I&#39;d like some time off so I can look into this new job. Think you 
could accommodate me?&quot;

 

- Fleur Lacroix, unknown weight (thin), French, right midfielder-

 

Odessa wasn&#39;t particularly embarrassed when Agatha came into her office 
wearing those odd clothes- as a matter of fact, she had seen far 
stranger things at the O and A. Many of her patrons had fetishes that 
would put this eccentric woman to shame. She did, however, feel sorry 
that she didn&#39;t know much about the case.

&quot;All I know is that the employee of a friend is in some kind of bad 
situation, and there&#39;s more to it than we believe. Her name&#39;s, 
uh...Felicia, I think- no, wait, Felicity. Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Aaaahhh,&quot; she sang, blowing bubbles. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about the details. 
I&#39;ve had less to work with and managed to succeed. Where does she work?&quot;

&quot;A place called the Lily Club; it&#39;s just a few blocks away. Um, her 
manager&#39;s name is Gardenia Kemper. I think Felicity&#39;s on the soccer 
team, too. Yeah, she is.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;d have more luck talking with Miss Gardenia?&quot; Odessa nodded, and 
Agatha thanked her for her time. She was already hypothesizing that 
Felicity&#39;s troubles could stem from work, school, or practice, and in a 
few minutes, she would know for sure.

It definitely wasn&#39;t her job. The Lily Club seemed like a wonderful 
place for a weary soul to rest- Agatha certainly had a good time- and 
since Felicity&#39;s condition apparently didn&#39;t improve, even with a jovial 
friend working with her, Agatha had to eliminate that. She didn&#39;t want 
to talk with Felicity herself unless she had exhausted all other 
resources; she felt the situation would only worsen. Next came her 
school, and the team, but those turned out to be dead-ends as well. Her 
classes were appropriate for a young woman with a job and a sport, she 
was getting good grades, and her Coach promised that, except for a few 
weeks of &quot;crunch time&quot;, their practice schedule was fairly lenient. It 
was from Leena where Agatha gleaned the most information.

&quot;Some of her problems might come from her father,&quot; she murmured. &quot;I&#39;ve 
never met him in person, but after reading Velur&#39;s dossier, I got the 
impression that he was living vicariously through her. She has so many 
awards, trophies, ribbons, and plaques that I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if 
she dedicated a whole room to them, but she still acts like she&#39;s not 
good enough. I&#39;ve heard of parents pressuring their kids to work hard, 
but this is borderline psychotic. I saw him talking to her after our 
first practice game, and while I couldn&#39;t hear what they were saying, it 
wasn&#39;t exactly a warm conversation. Personally, I think she was 
excellent, given the circumstances.&quot;

&quot;Does she try to make friends?&quot; Leena only had to shake her head.

&quot;A few of the others seem to like her, though, especially Nazario and 
Khovansky.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, I interviewed Miss Khovansky, but I couldn&#39;t get very many 
facts.&quot;

&quot;Right, she is a little difficult to understand,&quot; Leena murmured, 
smiling faintly. Agatha rubbed her neck casually.

&quot;No, I speak Russian. I understood her- she just didn&#39;t know very much.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Anyway, sorry I couldn&#39;t be of any help.&quot;

&quot;On the contrary!&quot; she exclaimed, proudly chewing on her pipe. &quot;Now that 
I know for sure she can&#39;t be suffering due to school or practice, that 
leaves me fewer possibilities. Once you eliminate the impossible and the 
improbable, the solution presents itself! I am misquoting him, of 
course- Sir Arthur Conan, I mean- but those are my thoughts.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Is there any relation?&quot;

&quot;Because we have the same last name?&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. Well, 
I&#39;ll be on my way soon, but don&#39;t hesitate to call me if you discover 
anything else. This is proving to be an intriguing case!&quot; She cackled to 
herself and walked away; Leena couldn&#39;t help but grin at Doyle&#39;s utter 
silliness. Only a real genius could afford to be that eccentric.

 

Samuel Velur, apparently the root of Felicity&#39;s anguish, didn&#39;t seem 
like such an awful bloke at first. He could be forgiven for his paranoia 
when Agatha announced that she was a private detective (she didn&#39;t 
mention Aegis), but he calmed down once he realized she was a few screws 
short of a toolbox. He even invited her inside, and smiled as he offered 
her drinks.

&quot;I don&#39;t drink anything with caffeine in it: turns me normal,&quot; she 
stated. &quot;Root beer or green tea will be fine. Ooh! Anything citrus?&quot;

&quot;Um, well, I have some grapefruit juice, if that&#39;s what you mean.&quot;

&quot;Perfect!&quot; Agatha drank a whole glass down before asking a single 
question. &quot;Whew! Well, I must say, your hospitality is great. But 
anyway, about while I&#39;m here. To make a long story short, several of 
your daughter&#39;s friends, coworkers, and teammates are showing concern 
for her...well, I don&#39;t know how to put it, but I believe it&#39;s some kind 
of social or emotional deterioration.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he asked sharply.

&quot;Well, her work environment is one of the healthiest and most uplifting 
I&#39;ve seen, and she&#39;s managed to get at least two people who&#39;ve grown 
fond of her, and yet she never seems to be in a good mood.&quot;

&quot;She really should not be working in the first place,&quot; he muttered 
darkly. &quot;Felicity should be concentrating on school and sports.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s where I thought the problem was,&quot; she announced patiently. 
&quot;But her academic life is smooth sailing, and her Coach has nothing but 
praises.&quot;

&quot;That sounds correct,&quot; he agreed, &quot;even though that woman could 
certainly use her more- and Felicity could work harder.&quot;

&quot;As could we all. Her Coach thought it might have something to do with 
the family, so I did a little research and- &quot;

&quot;How dare you interfere in my private life!&quot; he roared, standing up as 
if she had threatened his own mother. Agatha continued undeterred.

&quot;- and discovered that you divorced your wife when she was only two 
years old. Felicity&#39;s barely had any contact with her mother her entire 
life, aside from a few birthday cards. When was the last time they met?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve never seen each other since,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;I had to file a 
restraining order on that woman.&quot;

&quot;But for what purpose? My investigation led me to believe she&#39;s an 
exemplary person. Of course, I haven&#39;t actually spoken to her- &quot;

&quot;Then how can you decide based solely on what you&#39;ve seen?&quot; he replied, 
almost seething with anger. &quot;I&#39;ve known that woman for many years, and 
she brought me nothing but disappointments. She would have dragged this 
family to ruin and wrecked everything I had worked for. I only want my 
daughter to succeed and become a renowned individual. You don&#39;t win at 
life by being a fifth-rate nobody.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps, but I still think it&#39;s unusual to deny your daughter some 
visitation with the woman who gave birth to her, especially since she 
has no criminal background- &quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve heard just about enough from you!&quot; he exclaimed, fighting to keep 
himself from lashing out. &quot;I would like you to leave my house 
immediately or I&#39;ll call the police and have you arrested!&quot;

&quot;Funny thing, that,&quot; she squeaked, flipping her Aegis badge open. &quot;I 
actually work with the police! How about that, huh? But since I don&#39;t 
have any warrants, and I don&#39;t want to encourage your temper- and I 
believe I have sufficient data as is- I&#39;ll leave anyway. Call me if you 
need my help!&quot;

&quot;Just leave,&quot; he demanded, nearly pushing her out the door. Agatha 
dusted herself off and, as casually as she could, started blowing 
bubbles to calm her nerves. &quot;Sheesh, what a dickweed. But he&#39;s 
definitely an interesting case. I wonder what would happen if I threw 
him in a room with Dr. Baquero. Ha! Nothing good, I&#39;ll bet. Welp, onward 
and upward! This trail won&#39;t blaze itself!&quot;

And so the hunt continued, Agatha unsatisfied with her results. Sure, it 
was likely that all of Felicity&#39;s torment came from her father, but 
there was always another side to these cases, and Agatha didn&#39;t feel 
right putting all the blame on Samuel Velur&#39;s shoulders. He was really 
more pathetic than evil, and in time, if she was strong enough, Felicity 
could overcome him and emerge as the person she was meant to become. No, 
there was something else to this puzzle, something more elusive, and 
after countless hours of snooping, digging, interrogating, 
badge-flashing, and eliminating possibilities, Agatha finally hit the 
jackpot.

&quot;So,&quot; she whispered, peering at Felicity&#39;s bank statements, &quot;the name of 
the game is blackmail, eh? Heheheh...eureka!&quot;
