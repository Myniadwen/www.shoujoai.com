<a href="../original/hartmind-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The rest of the day Sam found herself restless and she could not get 
that toy of Lisa&#39;s out of her mind. She kept wondering if there was some 
connection between it and the strange things that have been happening to 
her all her life. There was, of course, the animals that seemed to have 
no fear of her, the strange way she would know it was going to rain and 
how she would know that the phone was about to ring before it actually 
did. She always passed it off as just nothing and yet after the incident 
with that toad and now this horoscope device Samantha was beginning to 
wonder if it was much more then just coincidence. She was so lost in her 
thoughts that she didn&#39;t even notice the final bell had rung until 
someone bumped into her arm on their way out of the class. She shook the 
fog from her head and started to gather her things when she felt 
something pass by. She glanced up to find Beth standing in front of her 
desk, watching her.

&quot;BETH!!&quot; She jumped at the sight of the girl and grabbed at her heart in 
an attempt to slow it down. The way the girl&#39;s dark eyes staring out 
from under her bangs made Samantha tremble. She felt as if the girl was 
trying to peel away at the layers of her mind and reach into her 
thoughts, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; She inquired nervously as she 
continued to stuff her things into her pack. 

&quot;We have English class together.&quot; Beth reminded the girl in her usually 
monotone voice, she did not seem phased by Samantha&#39;s reaction to her 
suddenly appearance or really care that her friend had forgotten that 
she was in the class, &quot;I thought we could walk together... or 
something....&quot; Beth&#39;s voice trailed off as if she wanted to say more but 
did not know how to form the words.

The moment they had first met it was apparent to Sam that the girl was 
not used to talking and the fact that Beth was actually asking to spend 
time with her was more of a shocker, &quot;Uhhh... Sure.&quot; Sam slung her 
backpack over her shoulder and started out of the class, &quot;I need to drop 
by my locker. Where&#39;s yours?&quot; She inquired realizing just how little she 
knew about the girl.

&quot;Across from yours.&quot; Beth replied nonchalantly. 

&quot;Really?&quot; Sam was even more astonished; &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing you 
around my locker before. How come you never said hi in the morning 
before?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Beth merely shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m not much of a morning person.&quot; She lowered 
her head and stared down at her Mary Jane shoes as they strolled through 
the school halls.

&quot;Neither am I.&quot; Sam admitted, keeping in step beside her friend, &quot;I 
nearly killed the alarm clock this morning.&quot; She stated with a chuckle, 
&quot;I never seem to be in a very good mood first thing in the morning. I 
don&#39;t know why.&quot; 

Beth seemed to be about to say something then stopped herself, then 
continued as if she changed her mind again, &quot;Maybe we are meant for the 
night. I always felt more alive and awake during the night.&quot; She 
explained then glanced at Samantha, &quot;How about you? What makes you feel 
alive?&quot;

Samantha thought for a moment, &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; She replied, she had 
never really thought about something like that before, &quot;I guess I feel 
like that when I&#39;m riding my bike through the woods. The wind rushing 
through my hair makes my mind seem more awake and I wish I could ride 
forever.&quot; She suddenly realized what she was saying sounded stupid and 
stop herself from continuing, &quot;Sorry, I guess that is kind of dumb.&quot; She 
stated with an embarrassed flush.

Beth shook her head, &quot;I figured you for an Earth or Wind Spirit so what 
you said makes sense.&quot; She explained softly. 

Samantha&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Earth or Wind Spirit? What does that mean?&quot; 
She asked in confusion.

&quot;Nothing...Never mind.&quot; Beth ran a free hand through her dark hair 
revealing her eye shadow covered deep green eyes. Eyes so vibrant that 
Sam wondered why the girl would hide them behind her bangs. Beth&#39;s eyes 
darted from Sam and back to the ground, then she let go of her hair and 
allowed her bangs to veil her eyes from sight yet again.  

Sam felt the urge to reach out and push that hair out of the girl&#39;s eyes 
again. Just to get another look at those immaculate eyes. She tried to 
think of how to phrase the words that were working through her mind. She 
wanted to compliment Beth on her eyes but everything she thought of 
saying sounded so cheesy to her and as such the two of them fell into an 
awkward silence.  

Abruptly Elizabeth stopped in the middle of the hall and pointed at a 
group of lockers, &quot;My locker is over there.&quot; She stated, trying to put 
an end to the unnerving silence. 

Sam stared in disbelief. Beth&#39;s locker was exactly across from her own, 
just as the girl had said. She swallowed her bewilderment and smiled at 
the girl, &quot;Well, I&#39;ll try to say &#39;hi&#39; next time.&quot; She promised as she 
started towards her own locker. 

&quot;Samantha?&quot; Beth&#39;s voice had a touch of worry to it that made Sam turn 
to face the girl.

&quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Samantha inquired curiously.

Beth fixed her glasses upon her nose and nervously glanced up and down 
the hall, &quot;Y... your birthday is tomorrow right?&quot; She anxiously 
inquired.

Samantha gave the girl a peculiar look, &quot;Yes...&quot; She replied feeling 
guilty that she did not invite the girl to her slumber party tomorrow, 
&quot;I&#39;m turning sixteen. How did you know?&quot; She did not remember mentioning 
her birthday at all to Beth before.

&quot;Be careful tonight.&quot; Beth stated then quickly turned to her locker 
without another word. 

Samantha watched the way the frills of the girl&#39;s dress flowed around 
her lace covered legs as she moved and tried to make sense of the 
conversation. This day was only getting stranger by the moment and she 
was not sure if she wanted to know what would happen next. As she shook 
her head of her worries she noticed Tristan standing near their lockers, 
&quot;Hi Trish, what is up?&quot; She waved as she headed over to her friend.

Tristan did not reply her attention seemed to be drawn to Beth, a fierce 
look upon her face. Sam could sense a thick cloud of unease hovering 
over her friend&#39;s head. She glanced over at Beth to see the girl slowly 
close her locker then head out of the school without so much as a look 
over her shoulder back at them. 

Sam returned her gaze back to Tristan, whom was still glaring at Beth, 
&quot;Tristan?&quot; Samantha poked the girl in the arm. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Tristan blinked at Samantha, &quot;Oh, hey Sam.&quot; The clouds quickly 
dispersed the moment Tristan set her eyes on Sam. It was as if the mere 
sight of her friend brightened her very mood, &quot;What were you and Beth 
talking about?&quot; She inquired eagerly, a smile painted across her face. 

Sam watched her friend cautiously, she was almost certain she could hear 
a hint of bitterness in her friend&#39;s tone. She had never seen her friend 
reacting so strangely to another girl before and it worried her, 
&quot;Nothing much.&quot; She said apprehensively, &quot;She asked about my birthday 
then told me to be careful tonight. That was about all.&quot; She added with 
a shrug, &quot;She&#39;s a nice girl, even if she&#39;s a little odd.&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t invite her to your birthday party, did you?&quot; Tristan asked 
uneasily. 

&quot;Nope.&quot; Samantha milled the idea over in her head, &quot;You think I should 
have?&quot; She inquired, considering running after Beth to ask if she would 
be interested in a sleep over.  

&quot;I think your mother would have kittens if she saw Beth.&quot; Tristan 
remarked as she closed her locker, &quot;Hey, you want to drop by the mall 
with me for a sec?&quot; She asked, changing the subject.

A flash of Sam&#39;s mother&#39;s angry face entered her mind from that morning, 
&quot;Yeah sure.&quot; Samantha would do anything to spend as much time away from 
home as she could and a trip to the mall sounded like a grand idea. 

&quot;Let&#39;s go then.&quot; Tristan gestured towards the school exit and the two 
girls left in search of their bicycles. 

****

It did not take them long to arrive at the local mall, if you could call 
it a mall. The building was a large slab of grey concrete that reminded 
Samantha more of a fallout shelter from some old Zombie Movie then an 
actually mall. The inside was not much better, it was a labyrinth of 
honey combed shaped halls lined with too many stores. To make matters 
worse many of the corridors went in circles or simply ended abruptly 
leaving a person feeling lost and confused. Samantha thought that was 
the building designers exact plan, to make everyone so confused that 
they were trapped with in its bleak walls with no sign of escape, giving 
them no other choice than to shop. While everyone complained about the 
headaches the building caused there wasn&#39;t another mall for miles so no 
one was willing to go elsewhere. 

Samantha and Tristan passed through the giant tinted glass double doors 
into the gloomy interior. The only light inside was provided by the dim 
glow of a few scattered lamps that lined the corridors. The lack of 
windows gave the place a feeling of never-ending dusk. As if the mall 
had been constructed for a clan of vampires and other sunlight-loathing 
creatures. 

&quot;What did you want to come here for?&quot;  Samantha asked as she glanced 
down the long hallways at the many stores.

&quot;Actually...&quot; Tristan lightly flushed, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to get you for 
your birthday so I thought...&quot; She drifted off in embarrassment.

&quot;We&#39;ve been friends for other for ten years now and you still don&#39;t know 
what I like.&quot; Samantha shook her head in disbelief, &quot;I thought you would 
be the first to know what to get me.&quot;

Tristan shrugged, &quot;What can I say? You aren&#39;t an easy person to shop 
for.&quot; She stated sheepishly, &quot;You&#39;re unique and I like you that way.&quot; 

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Samantha let out a sigh of defeat, &quot;Where do you want to 
go?&quot; 

&quot;I was going to ask you that.&quot; Tristan remarked with a smirk. 

Samantha took a deep breath, &quot;You&#39;re impossible sometimes.&quot; She noted 
then scanned the many stores and shrugged, &quot;I&#39;ve no idea what I want. 
You know me. I have trouble picking out clothes to buy.&quot; She reminded by 
pulling on her shirt.

Tristan nodded knowingly, &quot;True...&quot; An idea formed in her head, &quot;Hey, 
your mother agreed on Lisa and me staying overnight tomorrow, right?&quot; 
She inquired hopefully. 

Samantha nodded, &quot;Yeah, she didn&#39;t seem to like the idea but I managed 
to talk her into it.&quot; She did not want to tell Tristan that the sleep 
over might be called off if her mother upheld her threat to postpone her 
birthday.

&quot;How about we rent a bunch of horror movies?&quot; Tristan inquired suddenly 
motivated. 

&quot;I&#39;m only turning sixteen and you&#39;re still fifteen.&quot; Samantha reminded 
the girl, &quot;How are we going to rent good horror movies?&quot; She inquired, 
stressing the word &#39;good&#39;.

Tristan felt her idea burst and fly away, &quot;Well, it was worth a try.&quot; 
She remarked sadly when her stomach began to grumble loudly, &quot;How about 
we go to the food court while you think of what you want?&quot; She 
suggested, patting her tummy.

&quot;Sure.&quot; Samantha&#39;s stomach was getting slightly hungry as well and the 
mention of food woke it up all the more, &quot;Maybe I should tell mom where 
I am.&quot; She remarked, remembering her mother&#39;s speech about being 
responsible, &quot;You know how she gets when I don&#39;t leave a note when I&#39;m 
out.&quot; She stated dismally, not really wanting to talk to her mother just 
yet, but knowing if she did not she would be risking her birthday even 
more.

&quot;Well, the phones are over there.&quot; Tristan pointed to a set of payphones 
in circle. 

&quot;Be right back.&quot; Samantha ran to the phones while digging out a quarter 
from her pocket. She dropped the coin into the slot and dialled her home 
number.

After a couple of rings it picked up, &quot;Hello?&quot; a deep voice inquired 
through the receiver. 

&quot;Dad?&quot; Samantha was surprised to hear her father&#39;s voice on the other 
end of the line, &quot;What&#39;re you doing home?&quot; She could feel panic 
beginning to build up inside of herself. It had been over a month since 
her mother had finally kicked her father out of the house and she would 
never forgot for that day for the yelling had been more intense then any 
other on that day and it really upset her. Her mother&#39;s screams could be 
hear through the floor boards as she commanded her father to leave and 
never come back, however he drunkenly refused to leave, stating he had 
no money for a cab. Samantha finally got so fed up with the noise that 
she stormed down the stairs and handed her father ten dollars from her 
own pocket and asked him to go away. She had not seen him since that day 
and was much happier with the arrangement. Now if she could just get rid 
of her mother as well then her life would be great.

&quot;Hey baby girl.&quot; Her father&#39;s voice rang over the phone, snapping Sam 
out of her reminiscing. His speech filled with that chipper tone that 
she had begun to loath because it usually meant he wanted something, &quot;I 
was hoping to run into you at home before your mother came back from 
work, but I guess you&#39;re not here.&quot; He stated with a nervous chuckle. 

&#39;Well at least he isn&#39;t drunk.&#39; Samantha thought as she tried to figure 
out what to say to the man, &quot;Listen... dad, could you leave a note for 
mom for me?&quot; She asked hopefully, not really wanting to talk to the man 
anymore then she did her mother.

&quot;Sure thing.&quot; She could hear here father search for some paper, &quot;Shoot.&quot; 

&quot;Tell her I&#39;m with Tristan and she offered to buy me dinner as a 
birthday thing.&quot;  She explained quickly. &quot;So I won&#39;t be home for dinner, 
but I should be home later.&quot;
								
&quot;You&#39;re having dinner with Tristan?&quot; She could hear her father&#39;s heart 
breaking over the phone; &quot;I thought I could take you out for dinner 
tonight.&quot; He said unhappily, &quot;You know... like I used to do on your 
birthday.&quot;

&#39;Sorry dad, but I don&#39;t want to deal with your drunkenness the day 
before my birthday.&#39; She wanted to say but bit her tongue. She saw 
Tristan move in closer and she cupped her hand over the receiver, &quot;My 
father is home.&quot; She whispered loud enough for Tristan to hear. 

&quot;Your father?&quot; Tristan&#39;s face grew long with worry. 

Samantha returned to the phone, &quot;Listen dad, I&#39;m sorry but I have to go. 
Could you make sure you leave the note for mom? You know how she gets 
when I don&#39;t leave a note. Thanks.&quot; Before the man could reply she hung 
up the phone and took a deep shaky breath. 

Tristan gingerly set her hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You going to be 
alright?&quot; She inquired, concerned for her friend.

Samantha closed her eyes leaned against the phone booth as she tried to 
steady herself. She could feel the warmth of Tristan&#39;s hand upon her 
shoulder and focussed on it in an attempt to gain some form of control 
over her senses. She could almost feel Tristan&#39;s anxiety filled eyes 
carefully watching her. Sam suddenly wanted to be in the girl&#39;s arms, to 
be held and protected from the madness that was her family, &quot;C... can I 
stay at your place for a bit tonight?&quot; She finally managed to ask, 
feeling drained from the short conversation with her father. 

Tristan brightened and rubbed her friend&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Sure, you know my 
mom loves you.&quot; She exclaimed cheerfully. Tristan always seemed to 
lighten up at the idea of Samantha coming over, even if it was for a 
short bit. 

Sam was so glad she had such a good friend as Tristan. The girl was 
always there for Samantha in so many ways. Sam was almost sure that if 
she asked to live in the girl&#39;s closet she would jump at the idea and 
even clear out a spot for her in a moments notice. &quot;At least someone 
loves me.&quot; Samantha remarked miserably as she glanced up at her friend&#39;s 
beaming face.

Tristan opened her mouth as if to say something then changed her mind 
and glanced around nervously, &quot;Hey! Look at those things.&quot; She quickly 
moved away from Samantha towards a toy store not far from the payphones. 
Out front of the store Samantha spotted the strange toys that Lisa had 
during lunch, &quot;Would you look at these things!?!&quot; Tristan exclaimed 
picking up a pink Meephit that slightly resembled a rabbit and showed it 
to Samantha. 

&quot;I thought you told Lisa you weren&#39;t into those things?&quot; Samantha 
inquired as she approached the spinning rack of toys. There was a large 
variety of creature on display; everything from cats to crocodiles could 
be seen staring out of their sealed plastic containers, pleading for 
someone to free them from their prison.

Tristan gave a sheepish grin, &quot;I lied.&quot; She remarked as she picked up 
another of the creatures and scanned it, &quot;I just wanted Lisa to shut 
up.&quot; She admitted bluntly, &quot;You know how she can be at times. It&#39;s like 
she will never quit.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Samantha agreed as she turned the rack around, gazing from one 
critter to another.

&quot;You know how much I love strange stuffed animals.&quot; Tristan continued 
then stopped abruptly and blinked in stunned bewilderment at the 
Meephit&#39;s packaging and then another, &quot;Hey, would you look at this.&quot; She 
handed one of the toys to Samantha and pointed at the labels. 

Sam took the toy in her hand, being careful to hold it by its plastic 
box. In bright rainbow colours were the words &#39;MEEPHIT!!&#39; and underneath 
is exclaimed that this was &#39;Your new psychic pal.&#39; Samantha chuckled at 
the caption, and then noticed what her friend had been pointing at. 
Along the side of the package there was a small warning on the label, 
&quot;&#39;Some effects may very with each person and Meephit&#39;s persona.&#39;&quot; She 
read, &quot;What is that supposed to mean?&quot; She exclaimed in confusion. It 
made her think that it was possible for these toys to suddenly turn on 
its owner and attack them for no apparent reason. The thought made 
Samantha shudder and she quickly place the creature back on the rack.

A female store clerk with a wide smile upon her face approached them, 
&quot;They are cool, aren&#39;t they girls?&quot; she stated in a bubbly voice. Sam 
presumed the woman must have been a collage student and probably did not 
think that these creatures were cool at all. She was probably told that 
she needed to sell these things any way she could or she would be fired, 
&quot;They tell your fortune and can even tell you about the person who is 
your perfect soul mate.&quot; She happily continued on. 

Samantha glanced at the toy sceptically then recalled the one Lisa owned 
and frowned.

&quot;How do they work?&quot; Tristan asked, staring at the bunny with extreme 
interest.

&quot;I&#39;ve been told they look into your dreams.&quot; The clerk stated happily, a 
little to chipperly for Samantha, &quot;They are able to read your dreams and 
see what lays in your future.&quot; She explained.

Sam was about to tell Tristan she wanted to leave when she spotted a 
Meephit that looked like the toad from that morning, complete with large 
black eyes that stared out at her. She reached out and took the toad off 
the rack and gazed into its dark eyes curiously. A faint tingling filled 
her arm and felt the slight sensation of wind flowing passed her. She 
glanced around in search of the source of the breeze, but when she could 
not find it she turned back to the creature and those eyes.

&quot;That one just came in today.&quot; The clerk remarked with a grin, &quot;Every 
week a new member of the Meephit family arrives and I&#39;m always curious 
to see what they will come up with next.&quot; 

Samantha&#39;s face grew long as the creature transfixed her. She was about 
to set her hand upon the animal when Tristan grabbed her by the arm, 
&quot;Samantha? Are you alright?&quot; She inquired, worriedly giving the girl&#39;s 
hand a squeeze. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Samantha pulled her eyes away from the toy to fall on the 
distressed face of her friend. A smile broke out across Sam&#39;s face and 
she handed the toy to her friend, &quot;Would you get me this for my 
birthday?&quot; She inquired shyly. 

Tristan took the toy from her hand and glanced at it then back to her 
friend, &quot;Are... are you sure?&quot; She inquired uneasily. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Samantha said with a nod, &quot;He will make a great addition to my 
collection.&quot; 

&quot;But I thought your mother told you to get rid of your stuffies?&quot; 
Tristan asked leerily. 

&quot;It&#39;s not up to her what I get for my birthday.&quot; Samantha remarked 
angrily. 

Tristan took a step back from her friend, slightly startled by the anger 
in Sam&#39;s eyes. She glanced down at the toy toad again and shrugged, &quot;If 
you insist.&quot; A smile suddenly crossed her face and she scooped up the 
bunny, &quot;I&#39;ll get one too. Then if your mother complains we can say that 
all the girls have them, kay?&quot; 

Samantha nodded in agreement. 

&quot;You have made a good choice.&quot; The clerk remarked as took the toys from 
the girl&#39;s hands then gestured to the cashier&#39;s counter, &quot;Would you 
follow me and I&#39;ll ring up your purchase?&quot; She inquired as she rounded 
the counter.

Tristan dug in her pocket for her wallet, a black leather wallet with a 
white skull sewn onto the outside, &quot;It&#39;s a good thing mom gave me some 
extra spending money yesterday.&quot; She stated as she pulled a couple of 
twenties out of her wallet and set them on the counter. 

Samantha did not hear her friend, she was too busy watching the clerk 
punch numbers into the register and place the new toys into a plastic 
bag, &quot;Here you go, Enjoy!&quot; The clerk stated as she handed some change 
and the bag to Tristan who counted the remaining money and sighed. 

&quot;How about we go to my place for dinner?&quot; She inquired anxiously. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Samantha agreed happily, &quot;Maybe your mom will rent us a movie or 
something?&quot; 

&quot;Worth givin&#39; it a shot.&quot; Tristan remarked with a shrug, &quot;I just hope 
she doesn&#39;t kill me for spending all this money on these things.&quot; 

&quot;Just tell her it was a gift for me and she&#39;ll understand.&quot; Samantha 
suggested as they headed back out of the mall. 

&quot;I hope you&#39;re right.&quot; Tristan remarked as they hopped on their bikes 
and headed for her house.
