<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 58 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch57.html">Back to Part 57</a><pre>Jessica was certain that someone up there had seen her. She could see 
two shadows moving about in the room now and was almost sure that she 
had heard someone call out her name. She wondered what they were up to 
at that moment, if she remembered correctly the room was locked and the 
windows barely opened. In the summers it was nearly unbearable with the 
sun blazing through that window with no way to get much of any fresh 
air. She watched in curiosity as the figures rushed about. Then one of 
the shadows returned to the window and she could see something flutter 
down on the wind. She chased the object; afraid the wind would run off 
with whatever it was that the girls were trying to send her. She caught 
the paper as it drifted through the air and unfolded it to see someone 
had scribbled on a piece of colouring book paper. 

&quot;Meet me in the shed. 
I will come for you when I can.
Love Amber.&quot; 

Jessica smiled at the note; it really was Amber in the window after all, 
just like she remembered. She rushed over to the streetlight and waved 
up at the girls, pointing at the note, then gesturing to the back of the 
building. When the shadows waved back she started around the building, 
new hope in her heart and a spring in her stride. She barely noticed 
that her body had reverted back to that of a twelve year old and her 
pants were bunching up around her ankles. Something about getting a note 
from Amber made her heart sing and she skipped along in hopes that she 
would see the girl again soon. 

As she entered the backyard another memory flickered to mind. Her eyes 
darted to the dying leaves and a set of racks leaning against a small 
rickety wooden shed near the back. Her heart began to race as she 
recalled that day not too long ago. Jessica and Amber had been ordered 
to rack the leaves out back, but Amber had other ideas. Jessica tried to 
be serious about her chores for she did not want to end up in the 
cupboard again. Ma&#39;am had been on Jessica&#39;s case ever since catching her 
kissing Amber one-day and Jessica planned to not let that happen again. 

However, Amber seemed to enjoy the risk of being caught doing something 
they were not supposed to. While Jessica racked the leaves into a large 
pile Amber grabbed a handful of leaves and tossed them at Jessica. At 
first Jessica tried to ignore the girl&#39;s attempts at being playful, then 
finally she could no longer hold herself back and she leap at the girl, 
tackling her to the pile of leaves. Jessica lay on top of Amber for a 
moment when Amber suddenly raised her head and kissed Jessica ever so 
lightly upon the lips. 

The memory of that kiss sent shivers through Jessica&#39;s body, she 
suddenly recalled the sweet taste of the girl&#39;s lips and the beautiful 
scent of her body, a combination that was deadly for Jessica and 
weakened her resistance. She did not want to get in trouble again, but 
she could not withstand Amber&#39;s touch. Just as Amber&#39;s hands moved under 
Jessica&#39;s shirt, along her side, the back door abruptly opened and Ma&#39;am 
stormed towards them. She had kicked Jessica off of Amber and hit her 
repeatedly across the face, forcing Jessica back into the tool shed, 
where Ma&#39;am shoved Jessica inside and locked the door, leaving the girl 
there for several days with only a few scraps to eat. 

Jessica&#39;s heart ached as she stared at the old weather worn tool shed. 
Now she wished that Amber had not chosen such a place for her to hide, 
but she knew it would be the last place Ma&#39;am would ever enter. Ma&#39;am 
only sent the girls to the shed to gather gardening tools for the 
backyard and never entered the shed herself, as much as Jessica could 
remember. Jessica swallowed back her fears as she approached the shed 
and cautiously tested the door, just like always Ma&#39;am had not locked 
the door. She seemed to only lock the shed if there was someone she 
wished to stay within, not to keep people out of it. Slowly Jessica 
opened the door to find it dark and musky inside, a smell she would 
rather not repeat inhaling. She glanced back at the house as she tried 
to think of another plan to get the girl&#39;s out of the infernal place. 
Her eyes darting to the windows and doors in search for a way in and 
out, but she had tested those escape routes so many times over the years 
that she knew there was no hope of escape other then being let out by 
Ma&#39;am. Realizing this she let out a deep sigh of defeat, she had been 
lucky the first time she found a way out but knowing Ma&#39;am, she would 
have doubled the locks on that window or even nailed them tightly shut 
if she felt no need for opening them, leaving not even enough room for a 
spider to enter or leave.

Jessica reluctantly entered the shed and firmly closed the door behind 
her. Light inside was only proved by the small cracks in the ceiling 
panels. She only hoped that it did not rain that night as it did that 
day she had been left in here before. She moved to the back of the 
cramped space where there was a large unused worker&#39;s bench and curled 
up under it. The cold air seeped through the cracks in the small shed 
and Jessica curled up tight, hugging her legs to her body for warmth. 
With hope that the sun would rise soon and with it Amber&#39;s return to her 
arms.
