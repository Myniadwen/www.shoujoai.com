<h1>The Misadventures of Holly-Raine (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hollyraine-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Note: This chapter is special/different from previous ones. It&#146;s a sort 
of introductory chapter for a character named &#145;Kandi&#146; who&#146;ll appear in 
her own story (The Misadventures of Kandi)  as soon as the Misadventures 
of Holly-Raine is complete. Make a note of her, but for now, she&#146;s not 
seriously important. It&#146;s also worth saying that this chapter also hosts 
two requests in one shot. 

**********  

Silence. 

Well, not complete silence. The odd scrape of a button entering a hole 
or the hike up of a skirt were common sounds. But aside from the noises 
of two girls dressing themselves, and the muffled music of Summer&#146;s 
sound systems, there was nothing to be heard. Holly didn&#146;t exactly know 
what Summer was thinking, but whatever it was, it was making the 
situation kind of uncomfortable. 

Holly-Raine slowly fastened the clothes that had come loose in her 
experience with Summer. While she did that, just a few metres across 
from her was the birthday girl herself, who was getting dressed. There 
was, as stated, a silence between them. 

In the midst of carnal passion, logic is really a secondary thing. What 
takes control is your heart, your desire. But once that moment of 
passion was over, rationality returns. And you are forced to weigh the 
consequences of your actions. Holly-Raine squirmed when she looked at 
Summer. There was a blank expression on her face. Before, when she had 
first climaxed, Summer had a grin that could melt diamonds. Now she 
seemed... stoic. As if she had verged on a subject that she had wanted 
to avoid, or, couldn&#146;t completely understand. 

It was then, at that point, that Holly began to feel some misgivings for 
sleeping with Summer. Maybe it wasn&#146;t the right way forward. It was 
supposed to be just one night. Just one little outing to show how much 
Holly valued Summer. But it wasn&#146;t quite that simple, if you *really* 
looked at it. 

Friendships can be strong, but can also be brittle. They change the 
moment you take things a step further. Which was rational. How can you 
go back to being &#145;simple best friends&#146; when you&#146;ve had your tongue 
inside that person&#146;s vagina? It occurred to Holly-Raine that she had 
altered their relationship already. They would never be able to look at 
each other in the same light again. And from the look on Summer&#146;s face, 
she was realizing the same thing. Maybe more. 

Holly had been aware of her sexuality long ago. From the time she had 
been dreaming of marrying her favourite movie starlet, when she was a 
kid, she had known what she was. But would Summer adjust so easily? Sex 
is never the best way to discover who you are. It takes caring and 
compassion to do that. And it takes a whole lot more to understand your 
sexuality. A tingle of a chill passed through Holly&#146;s body, when she 
realized that she may have made one hell of a mistake. 

She had to know. &quot;S-Summer...?&quot;

The girl in question turned her head. &quot;...Yeah?&quot;

&quot;We&#146;re still cool, right?&quot; Holly asked quietly. &quot;I mean... what happened 
between us... was just one night. It won&#146;t change our friendship, will 
it?&quot;

Summer looked at Holly-Raine for a second, then shook her head. &quot;No. 
Don&#146;t worry. I&#146;m okay with this. I said so, remember? I... I guess I&#146;m 
just a bit confused. Hell, I&#146;d say confused is an understatement. Of all 
the people in the world, I just never expected my first time to be 
with... you. I guess I thought it would happen differently. Like with 
Jackson, or something.&quot;

Holly frowned. &quot;Oh, Summer, you&#146;re not still thinking of him, are you? 
That guy&#146;s a waste of space. Besides, I heard that he&#146;s dating someone 
from Saffron-Jameson High right now.&quot;

Summer smiled. &quot;He and I are over, Holly. I just mean that... I never 
expected it to be like this. I know I put up a big front for you and 
Jenny, but I&#146;m just as romantic as you guys.&quot;

Holly shook her head, urgently. &quot;I didn&#146;t mean to take anything away 
from you, Summer. I really didn&#146;t. I just wanted to give you-&quot;

Holly couldn&#146;t finish her sentence. By the time she tried, Summer was by 
her side, placing a long finger on her rosy pink lips. &quot;Hey, it&#146;s okay. 
Like I said, I wanted it and I enjoyed it. And it was just one night. 
We&#146;re friends, you know? Nothing will come between us.&quot;

Holly smiled sweetly from hearing that. She was happy that things 
wouldn&#146;t change because of her &#145;present&#146;. You could dub her a slut or 
whatever you liked, but Holly&#146;s main concern was always for her friends. 
Though she tended to think with her libido rather than her brain, that 
was one thing Holly could never be faulted with. The two girls got back 
to re-dressing (mostly for Summer, since Holly hadn&#146;t removed much of 
her clothes) then prepared to walk back out into the hallway. Holly did 
the honours, unlocking then opening the door. And their eyes and ears 
were once again bombarded with the sounds and sights of a teen house 
party.

**********

&quot;Quite frankly, my dear, I don&#146;t give a damn.&quot;

The sound of sobbing. Tissues littered across the floor like the fallen 
petals of a rose. A woman wrapped in the warmth of her bedspread. With a 
bucket of partially melting ice-cream in one hand, and a TV remote in 
the other. Tracks of dried out tears stained her flustered cheeks. And a 
classic movie, rolling into the end credits, was playing in the 
background. 

These were the signs of a woman, broken.

Linda sighed, dropping the remote. She went for the metal spoon lodged 
into her tub of ice-cream, and swirled it around a bit. She pulled it 
out, then thrust a portion of her &#145;comfort food&#146; into her mouth. She 
sobbed again, but leaked no tears. If there was one thing she didn&#146;t 
want to do, it was cry. Debbie dumping her was probably one of the 
lowest points in her adult life. But goddamn, she wasn&#146;t going to cry 
about it. Not anymore. Linda hadn&#146;t shed a tear since her father died 
eight years ago. She couldn&#146;t allow herself to weaken now.  Not even for 
Debbie Harding.

But god, Linda missed her so much...

Why is it that you miss the person the most, straight after the break 
up? It made the situation so unbearable. To have to constantly remind 
yourself of the mistakes you&#146;ve made, or where things went wrong. To 
know that, eventually, someone else would be holding the woman you love 
in *their* arms, not yours. 

Linda slumped deeper into her bed, her lip trembling. It was so alarming 
for her to see the state that she had been put into by Debbie. Though 
Linda was an educated woman, here she was, moping over a bucket of 
ice-cream, wishing her problems would disappear. But would they? Hell 
no. 

But why was Linda feeling like this? 

Did Debbie really mean that much to her? If so, why was she so afraid to 
commit to her? No matter how hard she searched herself, Linda could not 
come up with the answer to that. It seemed like no matter what she did, 
this break up couldn&#146;t be avoided. There was absolutely nothing that 
could solve the situation. Linda stifled another sob, then went for the 
tub of ice-cream again. It was Saturday night, and maybe she should have 
gone out with her friends or something, but she couldn&#146;t bring herself 
to. All she could really think about was her sadness. How Debbie had 
dumped her. And how hopeless the circumstances really were. How was 
going to look Debbie in the eye when they went to work on Monday? There 
was no way she could avoid Debbie all day, they would eventually cross 
paths. And they almost always did. 

It was then that the phone rang. The one on her bedside chest of 
drawers. Though there was a twinge in her heart, Linda remained 
motionless. She knew full well that it would not be Debbie. She didn&#146;t 
answer the phone, as she had no desire to speak to anyone right now. In 
fact, Linda even doubted that she would even turn up for work next week. 

Once the phone reached its fourteenth ring, it was obvious that whoever 
it was wasn&#146;t going to give up. Linda snarled, then yanked the receiver 
up to her ear.

&quot;What the hell is it?!&quot; She asked indignantly. 

There was a sigh on the other side of the phone. &quot;I see you&#146;re not doing 
any better.&quot;

She knew that voice. It wasn&#146;t Debbie, rather a friend of hers, named 
Janet. Janet and Debbie had been friends for quite sometime, before 
Linda even knew Debbie. She was a nice person, but Linda couldn&#146;t 
understand why Janet would be calling her. Aside from their shared 
acquaintance of Debbie, there was very little that Linda and Janet had 
in common.

&quot;Janet,&quot; Linda said apologetically. &quot;I&#146;m... sorry. I&#146;m just kind of 
upset right now.&quot;

&quot;I can guess. Debs told me about what happened between you two. She&#146;s 
not so happy herself.&quot;

Linda sneered, scathingly. &quot;She isn&#146;t, huh? Oddly enough, she didn&#146;t 
seem the least bit hesitant to cut me loose. She doesn&#146;t give a damn 
about me.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s not true, and you know it.&quot; Janet responded. &quot;If she didn&#146;t 
care, she wouldn&#146;t be this angry with you, Linda. I know she&#146;s crazy 
about you. Just try one more-&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Linda cut Janet right off. &quot;Forget it. She&#146;s made her choice. You 
think I&#146;m gonna ring her up again and make a bigger fool of myself? 
Begging her to take me back? No way. I haven&#146;t done anything wrong. I 
can&#146;t commit to her, and if she can&#146;t handle that, then maybe she&#146;s 
right. Maybe we aren&#146;t meant for each other.&quot;

Janet sighed again. &quot;I know you don&#146;t mean that. She loves you, please 
just give it a go.&quot;

&quot;Why do you even care this much?&quot; Linda questioned.

There was a little pause, before Janet replied. &quot;I&#146;ve never seen Debbie 
happier than when she&#146;s with you. You&#146;d be surprised at how empty her 
life was before she met you. She really believes that you&#146;re the one for 
her. She&#146;s just angry right now, Linda. Please try again. If you 
don&#146;t...&quot;

Linda piped up as Janet trailed off. &quot;If I don&#146;t... what?&quot;

&quot;You... you might lose her to someone else.&quot;
 
It didn&#146;t take ten guesses to figure out who that was. The &#145;friend&#146; that 
Debbie had mentioned over the phone. Linda had no idea who that was, but 
she had quite an accurate idea of what this woman wanted with Debbie. 

Linda tried to ignore her jealousy. &quot;...And?&quot;

&quot;Stop playing games!&quot; Janet yelled angrily. &quot;If you don&#146;t do something 
soon you may lose Debbie to that woman! You want that? Do you really 
want to watch her fall for someone else?&quot;

Again, Linda just ignored her jealousy. &quot;Maybe you didn&#146;t hear me. 
Debbie wants to move on. She was the one who broke this off. I called 
her twice. The first call she ignored, and on the second, she dumped me. 
I&#146;m not in the driver&#146;s seat on this one. Debbie&#146;s calling all the 
shots, okay? So if you&#146;re really serious about keeping me and her 
together, I&#146;m not the one you should be talking to.&quot;

&quot;I tried talking to Debbie.&quot; Janet replied.

Linda could guess what happened. &quot;And?&quot;

&quot;She&#146;s just as difficult as you are.&quot;

&quot;Well there you go.&quot; Linda sighed again. &quot;Debs wants to get on with her 
life. And if she&#146;s not prepared to save our relationship, then I&#146;m not 
either. I&#146;ve made a big enough fool of myself for calling her this 
morning, anyway.&quot;

Janet gave a groan of defeat. &quot;It looks like I won&#146;t be able to change 
your mind.&quot;

&quot;...Looks that way.&quot;

&quot;Okay. Fine. If you two can&#146;t act like adults and just talk this thing 
through, then I guess I can&#146;t force you to. But... Debbie is going to 
meet that woman tonight. At a midnight caf&eacute; on Hillcrest street. I think 
you should go there and put a stop to this. It&#146;s up to you.&quot;

Janet hung up. Leaving Linda with a fresh set of worries. Janet made it 
seem like *she* was the one in control here. But she wasn&#146;t. It was 
Debbie&#146;s wishes that ended their relationship. It wasn&#146;t like Linda set 
out for a break up. Quite the reverse. She wanted Debbie more than 
anything. For what other reason would Linda be wrapped up in her bed 
sheets with a tub of rum and raisin? But... she couldn&#146;t commit to 
her... she just couldn&#146;t...

**********

&quot;So um... have you seen Holly-Raine anywhere?&quot;

Jenny shook her head for a no, whist leaning up on the wall of Summer&#146;s 
large and jam-packed living room. Cassie lowered her head and wondered 
to herself. Where was Holly? She saw the brunette come into Summer&#146;s 
house, they had even spoken to each (for two brief seconds). So where 
was she? Even Summer herself had gone on something of a disappearing 
act. 

Honestly,  Cassie just wanted to present her feelings now. And carry her 
plan out. For many reasons. One, being that she was sort of 
uncomfortable at this party. The music was so loud, place was packed 
with half-drunk girls and boys, and Cassie felt somehow... misplaced. 
Another reason was, as always, Shannon. The older girl stood with her 
usual pack, on the other side of the room, pointing and smirking in her 
direction. Though Cassie was standing with Jenny, she highly doubted 
that Jenny was the subject of their humour. It was because of that, that 
Cassie was loosing her nerve. Humiliating herself in front of Holly 
would be one thing, but in front of Shannon, well that was another. 

&quot;I haven&#146;t seen her since she arrived!&quot; Jenny said loudly, to be heard 
over the music. &quot;What do you need to speak to her about?&quot;

Cassie&#146;s cheeks flowered a pale redness. &quot;N-Nothing much... really...&quot;

Jenny noticed that look of anxiousness on Cassie&#146;s face. &quot;Hey, is 
something wrong? You seem kinda down about something.&quot;

Cassie said nothing, but nudged her head over to Shannon and her group. 
Jenny looked over at them. They were laughing and giggling to 
themselves, looking at Cassie with disparaging but humoured glances. 
Shannon was centring it all. She made some comment every now and again, 
which Jenny could not hear, then the girls around her all burst into 
laughter. Their eyes did not move from Cassie. Which was what made Jenny 
realize that Cassie was being laughed at by them. 

Jenny sighed. She had no idea why Summer invited Shannon to her party. 
But then, in some respects, Summer didn&#146;t have much of a choice. Shannon 
Marson was one of the most popular girls in school, albeit her rudeness. 
She was invited to every party that had taken place in their year group. 
There was little Summer could do. If she refused Shannon&#146;s desire to 
come to the party, chances are that Summer would lose the &#145;semi-popular&#146; 
status she had acquired. 

Which was a shame for Cassie. Because she deserved to enjoy herself far 
more than Shannon ever did. &quot;...Ignore them.&quot;

Cassie nodded to Jenny&#146;s advice, then turned to walk away. She was well 
aware that Shannon was making fun of her, but there was no chance she 
was going to stand around and be laughed at. The timid blonde strode 
through the crowds of inebriated, dancing teens, towards the door which 
led out into the main hallway. While she did this, Shannon and her 
groupies whispered to themselves, and laughed a laugh of acceptance. 
Shannon winked at them, then strode over in Cassie&#146;s direction. Before 
Cassie reached the door, Shannon was in front of her, with a bottle in 
hand.

Cassie tried to ignore her, but couldn&#146;t. Shannon deliberately walked 
into Cassie&#146;s shoulder, bumping against her. As soon as Cassie jerked 
back, Shannon flicked the small bottle quickly. Cassie yelped with 
surprise as the clear drink was spurted from the tip of the uncapped 
bottle and doused the pink blouse she was wearing.

Shannon&#146;s groupies burst into fits of laughter, while some of the guys 
around who noticed this, chucked at it. Shannon stifled her giggled to 
speak.

&quot;Watch where you&#146;re going, huh?&quot; Shannon said, amused, &quot;I mean I know 
some of the boys here would like a wet t-shirt contest... but there 
really isn&#146;t much to enjoy, is there?&quot;

Though there were at least 30 or so people in that sizable room, around 
ten of them broke into erratic laughter. The blonde girl couldn&#146;t have 
possibly been more embarrassed. All of a sudden, she was wishing a hole 
would just crack open beneath her and swallow her whole. Cassie clenched 
her hands together and ran out of the room, before anyone could see her 
crying. Shannon just continued to chortle, walking back over to her 
group with a satisfied smile on her face. Cassie stumbled through the 
crowds of the hallway. There were so many people that she couldn&#146;t get 
to the door. Instead, she just ran up the stairs leading to the next 
floor of the house. There was no given restriction about the upstairs, 
but nobody had gone up there other than to use the bathroom. Cassie 
didn&#146;t much care at that point though. She ran up the stairs, turned the 
corner and entered into the nearest room she could find. The moment she 
did, she slammed the door behind her. She was in a spare bedroom. Cassie 
just sobbed, wrapping her arms around herself and closing her eyes. Even 
though she did, her tears could not be stopped from pouring down her 
cheeks. 

She knew that something like that was going to happen. She just knew it. 
Shannon always made trouble for her. Why? It wasn&#146;t like Cassie had said 
something to irritate her. Cassie didn&#146;t say things behind Shannon&#146;s 
back, either. All she wanted to do was to tell Holly how she felt. How 
could she do that now? Her blouse was ruined, stained by a 
Pineapple-flavour Barcardi Breezer, and her spirit was broken. Why did 
this have to be so hard? Why couldn&#146;t Holly just arrive on a winged 
horse and carry her off to a shared paradise? Was she ever going to 
catch a break?

Cassie sobbed once more, but managed to keep her crying under control. 
Shannon was still down there, and it would simply give the trendy more 
fuel for her tank to see Cassie in bits. For the moment, the girl just 
walked over to the bed and took a seat. 

The door opened a crack when she did so. Whoever it was, Cassie really 
didn&#146;t feel like talking to anyone. Least of all in this state. The door 
then swung open, the music growing louder while it happened. A figure 
was standing there, but was obscured by the clash of light from the 
outside and the darkness of the room. Cassie looked up at the person, 
quickly rubbing the tears out of her eyes. This girl was blonde, just 
like Cassie was, but of a darker tone, a sort of sandy blonde. That 
blonde hair had been tied up in firm braids, which spilled onto her 
shoulders and down against her back, quite elongated. Through the light 
provided by the open door, she could make out the girl&#146;s toned and 
tanned skin, her pouting lips and striking hazel eyes.

Cassie felt some familiarity from her, but couldn&#146;t quite place where it 
had come from. The girl closed the door behind her, then looked over at 
Cassie, her expression concerned. 

Her voice mirrored her expression. &quot;Hey. Are you okay? I can&#146;t believe 
Shannon did that to you.&quot; 

&quot;...I-I&#39;m fine...&quot; Cassie didn&#145;t even know this girl. But for some 
reason, some odd and peculiar reason,  she felt like she could trust 
her. &quot;I just... I hate Shannon so much. Why does she enjoy seeing me 
suffer?&quot;

&quot;Girls like that... they&#146;re just insecure. So shallow and pre-occupied 
with their looks that they have to make everyone else around them feel 
low. Just so that they can feel better about themselves.&quot;

Cassie lowered her face. &quot;But she&#146;s right though, isn&#146;t she? I&#146;m ugly.&quot;

&quot;No you&#146;re not,&quot; The girl walked away from the door towards the bed that 
Cassie was sitting on. She took a seat next to Cassie, but looked 
forwards whilst idly kicking her feet. &quot;I think you&#146;re pretty cute.&quot;

A little red blush appeared on Cassie&#146;s cheeks. &quot;Y-You don&#146;t mean that.&quot; 

&quot;Sure I do. I never tell a lie. And I never hesitate to say what I&#39;m 
thinking, either. You&#146;re cute. Don&#146;t let anyone tell you otherwise. 
Least of all Hairspray Queens like Shannon.&quot;

Cassie looked to her side, staring at this young woman. &quot;..W-Who are 
you?&quot; 

&quot;Alyshia,&quot; She supplied. There was a quiet firmness in her voice. It was 
playful, yet also, so very compassionate and romantic. &quot;Alyshia 
Hildabrant.&quot;

A smile finally came to Cassie&#145;s face. &quot;It&#146;s nice to meet you... 
Alyshia. I&#146;m-&quot;

&quot;I know who you are. Your name&#146;s Cassie Robbins, right?&quot; The fellow 
blonde asked. 

That had the shorter girl confused. &quot;You know me?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Alyshia nodded in earnest. &quot;We&#146;re in Miss Pennyworth&#146;s Chem. 
class together.&quot;

So that was where she knew this girl from. Chemistry. Out of all the 
classes Cassie took at Atlantic High, that one held the most trendies. 
It was therefore, one of the harder lessons for Cassie to deal with. It 
was also one of two classes she shared with Shannon, so it was a lesson 
she absolutely dreaded taking. It was for that reason that she did her 
best to keep her head down in class, lest Shannon and her cohorts drew 
attention to her. Which was also why Cassie hardly knew anyone in 
Chemistry. But what surprised Cassie the most, was that Alyshia had been 
the one to notice *her*. 

&quot;...I&#39;m surprised you noticed me.&quot; Cassie admitted. 

&quot;How could I not? You get the best grades in class! There&#146;s no way I 
could ignore that. Heck, if I had your brains, I doubt I&#146;d ever be 
unhappy.&quot; 

A grim chuckle. &quot;I hate it.&quot;

Though Alyshia could sense the blatant overtone of Cassie&#146;s comment, she 
couldn&#145;t help but lighten the mood with a little playful 
absentmindedness. &quot;Chem. class?&quot; 

&quot;Getting the best grades,&quot; Cassie corrected swiftly. &quot;People like 
Shannon hate me for it.&quot;

&quot;Hey, what did I tell you about listening to Shannon? She&#146;s nothing for 
you to worry about. When you&#146;re older, you&#39;ll be sitting pretty with 
some fancy upmarket job in Wall Street. And Shannon? She&#146;ll be flipping 
burgers until she&#146;s fifty.&quot; 

This time, Cassie did more than smile. She giggled. &quot;...Thanks.&quot;

&quot;For what?&quot; 

&quot;For talking to me. Cheering me up.&quot;

Alyshia just shrugged. &quot;Hey, no biggie. Talking with you is better than 
being downstairs and having to put up with Shannon Marson&#146;s crap. She&#146;ll 
get what&#146;s coming to her, one day.&quot;

&quot;One day soon?&quot; Cassie asked expectantly. 

Alyshia just cast another of those reserved smiles. &quot;Hopefully! So, you 
wanna get something to drink?&quot;

&quot;...Okay.&quot; Outlandishly, Cassie felt a bit more confident about going 
back downstairs. Even though Shannon was going to be down there. &quot;But 
I&#39;m not much of a drinker.&quot;

&quot;Neither am I. But it&#146;s free, and hey, that&#146;s what parties are for, 
right? C&#146;mon.&quot; 

The two girls smiled at each other. For the first time today, Cassie 
didn&#146;t feel nervous. Nor scared. Even after what Shannon had done to 
her. As soon as Alyshia presented her hand, Cassie received it 
cheerfully, then followed Alyshia out of the room. In just a short half 
hour of attending this party, Cassie had already made a charming new 
friend. 

**********

This was the place.

Debbie Harding studied the street carefully. Being that it was getting 
sort of late, there were fewer people out and about right now. The dark 
street, luminous only by the chain of street lamps, was mostly barren. 
But most of the shops and clubs in this section of the Hillcrest 
district were open. And on deeper inspection, Debbie noted that more and 
more people were located inside those buildings. But Debbie stood 
waiting, waiting by the edge of the road, for her &#145;friend&#146; to make her 
appearance. For some reason, the History teacher was nervous. 

Though she didn&#146;t think of it as such, to look at Debbie, you would have 
thought she was on a date. Her clothing certainly accommodated that 
belief. For the first time since her initial argument with Linda, she 
had made a serious effort to look good. Clad in a sleeveless, dark black 
top (tight around the chest), long silvery-white khakis and a pair of 
gleaming midnight pumps. Dangling from her ears were a pair of large 
silver hoop earrings. They were sort of gaudy in this day and age, but 
Debbie could pull off their look seamlessly. Her long tresses of raven 
black hair had been tied back into an uplifted ponytail, swishing 
loosely behind her back. 

Quite frankly, she looked gorgeous. Maybe excessively so. Considering 
that this wasn&#146;t a date. The person she was meeting... wasn&#146;t a 
girlfriend, just a friend. Debbie herself didn&#146;t know what she expected 
from tonight. Was she looking to cut her ties with Linda by meeting 
someone new? Or was this just some desperate act to get Linda out of her 
head as well as her heart? 

It brought dismay to Debbie when she realized that the latter was 
probably true. But she couldn&#146;t let that ruin this night. 

She was meeting Sammi. Her internet pseudonym was &#145;Forest Baby&#146; and her 
real name was Samantha Myers. But Debbie had taken to using the nickname 
&#145;Sammi&#146; for her. It had not escaped Debbie&#146;s mind that Sammi had 
feelings for her. Though she really had no answer for Sammi at that 
point, she was prepared to hear the woman out. If she was going to get 
there any time soon...

&quot;...Debbie...?&quot;

The History teacher swung around, carefully, due to the heels. She 
assumed it was Sammi. And sure enough, she was right. It was Sammi. 
Debbie cast her eyes on her internet friend for the first time ever. And 
to be truthful, Sammi was actually cuter than she looked in the picture 
that she e-mailed to Debbie. A little younger, too. Maybe it had 
something to do with her slightly taller height, her wavy brownish-gold 
hair,  or her babyish green eyes. Though Sammi was actually 32 in her 
years, she looked about the same age as Linda (26).

However, her voice presented more maturity than Linda ever did. &quot;It 
really is wonderful to see you, Debs.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s nice to see you too,&quot; Debbie replied, motioning to the caf&eacute; across 
the street. &quot;Shall we take a seat?&quot;

Sammi nodded with a smitten smile, then walked with Debbie across the 
road, to the caf&eacute; on the other side. It was more of a coffee shop, a 
sort of rare sight in Victoria, but welcomed magnificently. The two went 
over to one of the outside tables, below the overhanging parasol, and 
sat down respectively at the surrounding chairs. It was awkward at 
first. It was like, they had spoken to each other electronically for so 
long that they had not prepared for each other in person. For Debbie, it 
was even more cumbersome. Being that she had Sammi&#146;s feelings to 
consider...

Sammi was the first to speak at the table. &quot;So... this is a bit weird, 
huh?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Debbie chuckled nervously. &quot;We have known each other for a some 
time now, but now I&#146;ve met you, I can hardly think of what to say.&quot;

&quot;How about, how are you feeling?&quot;

Debbie looked downwards. Sammi seemed pretty quick when it came to her 
issue with Linda. Maybe for the purpose of confirming something. &quot;I... 
ended our relationship this morning.&quot;

Sammi narrowed her eyes curiously. &quot;You didn&#146;t do that because you were 
meeting me, did you?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Debbie shook her head to accentuate that point. &quot;She just isn&#146;t 
ready to give me what I need at this stage in my life. I need stability, 
assurance. I want to know that four months down the line, my partner and 
I will still be together.&quot;

Sammi cast her strong eyes to Debbie. &quot;I meant what I said, Debbie. I am 
ready to give you want you want. Even if that other woman isn&#146;t.&quot; 

The teacher wasn&#146;t sure how she felt about that. She liked Sammi, but as 
a friend. She was nice, sweet, and Debbie really did enjoy talking to 
her. But that wasn&#146;t the same as what it was with Linda. Linda Blake 
made Debbie&#146;s knees weak, her heart shudder. It was the classic 
struggle. 

To be with someone you love, or someone who loves you. 

Debbie looked up at Sammi. &quot;I-I can&#146;t give you that, Samantha. I really 
can&#146;t. As much as I like you... I&#146;m still in love with Linda. I don&#146;t 
know why she makes me feel the way I do. But... I can&#146;t turn my back on 
it just yet. I do not have that strength. I need more time.&quot;

Sammi sighed gently. It was more than obvious that she was disappointed 
by that, but she cared enough about Debbie to hide it. For the most 
part, she expected Debbie to have a hang-up on Linda. For now, she just 
had to act as an outlet for Debbie&#146;s anxieties. Then, slowly but surely, 
win that love she was craving.

**********

&quot;Dude, is it me, or have I seen that chick before...?&quot;

A collective group of young men, in a cluster of five, stood around at 
the back of Summer&#146;s teen/music populated living room. But while most of 
them jeered and laughed to themselves, some drinking, others chatting, a 
couple members of the group noticed someone. And the moment they did, 
they were in awe of her. 

A girl, or moreover a young woman, stood across from that group of boys. 
Against the armrest of one of Summer&#146;s many sofas, with a confident yet 
somehow anxious look on her face. The guys who were watching her 
couldn&#146;t have been more smitten. And with good reason. She was totally 
stunning. There was something about her that was just eye-catching.  
Boasting wonderfully feminine curves a her youthful body, luscious black 
shade of hair, dark marble eyes and creamy cinnamon-tone flesh. And, 
when she&#146;s dressed in an outfit like *that*, it was kind of impossible 
to ignore her...

One of the other boys noticed her. And his eyes widened with shock. 
&quot;Holy crap. I think I know that girl. When I was living with my pops in 
Dakota. Yeah! It&#146;s gotta be her! She was in a Miss Teen South Dakota 
competition. Just a couple years back.&quot;

The boy he was talking to cast another look at her. &quot;You&#146;re kidding me. 
Man... that probably means that I stand less of a chance... what&#146;s her 
name?&quot;

&quot;Janelle Campbell.&quot; He replied. &quot;And for the record, you stand no 
chance.&quot;

But while the two young men of the group mulled over their potential 
odds with the beautiful girl, Janelle herself was far too distracted to 
even notice them. In her eyes, there was a hint of anxiousness. Normally 
she would have enjoyed this party, considering the kind of freedom with 
it, but she was a bit more concerned with Kandi. It had been a while 
since they had dated. Almost half a year. And although they were friends 
now, Kandi&#146;s tone over the phone had been less than friendly. More like 
seductive. Janelle knew what to expect from that. Still, the current 
situation did beg the question, why?

She didn&#146;t have the time to answer that for herself. Across from her was 
the door leading back out into the hallway. Ambling through it was 
Kandi. In all her glory. Janelle felt angels pull at her heartstrings 
from watching her. Kandi was always so unbelievably hot. In every 
possible sense of the term. 

Katherine &#145;Kandi&#146; Danders. 

Only God or the Devil could accurately describe just how beautiful Kandi 
was. Terms like &#145;transcendent beauty&#146; and &#145;brutally perfect&#146; came to the 
minds of those who saw her. She was flawless. From her waist-long 
tresses of glossy strawberry blonde and her pale milk-tone skin, to her 
blindingly bright smile and the cute freckles that were sprinkled 
lightly over her nose. Her body lived up to that perfection, with 
elongated and beautifully sculpted legs and small firm breasts clinging 
to a thin torso. The curves of her thighs ran sweetly around her body, 
tormenting the weak and tempting the strong. Many a head turned as Kandi 
graced that room with her presence, mostly male, a couple female. But no 
matter who looked at Kandi, they were in no way safe from being 
bewitched by her.

She was of a submissive nature, a gentle and innocent personality 
wrapped inside a body that demanded to be shown the many pleasures and 
perversions of the flesh. Janelle&#146;s heart throbbed from simply watching 
the girl. To think, that Kandi had been the one to call her. 

But it was really very obvious what Kandi was expecting of her. And in 
the brief moment that they locked eyes on each other, this feeling was 
established. Janelle ran a hand through her silky black hair, then 
strode across the room, walking past all other party goers in her way. 
Kandi&#146;s smile deepened when Janelle approached her. Considering the 
history between the two of them, this really was no surprise...

&quot;Kandi.&quot; Janelle said, slowly. 

Kandi, the luscious redhead, smiled back at the taller girl. In an 
instant, she threw her arms around Janelle&#146;s neck, leaning in for a 
tight hug. It was, to others, a simple act of friendship. For Janelle 
and Kandi; it was a symbol of their previous love for each other. Kandi 
leaned into Janelle&#146;s ear and whispered, loving the closeness between 
them.

&quot;Janny... It&#146;s been a while, huh?&quot; The redhead spoke with increasing 
allure, &quot;We haven&#146;t spoken in weeks, really. Are you ignoring me?&quot;

Janelle grinned. &quot;Be damned if I would. You know what it&#146;s like. I&#146;m 
going back to Dakota tomorrow... and phone calls just aren&#146;t the same.&quot;

Kandi tightened her hug. &quot;You can&#146;t go... not until I get to say goodbye 
to you properly...&quot;

And that statement there was a no-brainer. At least for Janelle. Though 
Kandi was an innocent seeming girl, she was in no way reluctant about 
her sex drive. In fact, Kandi was more comfortable with herself than 
most girls her age. 

Not that she had a reason to be insecure... when you looked like she 
did, self-esteem was a given. Kandi slowly unwound her arms from 
Janelle&#146;s shoulders, then clasped her wrist. The two girls needed to 
exchange no words. It was their form of goodbye. When Kandi first moved 
from Dakota to Texas (Victoria) it was the fuel behind their previous 
break-up. Kandi wanted a long distance relationship, Janelle didn&#146;t see 
the point in one. Because of that disagreement, it was decided that they 
should just be friends. That was over six months ago. Janelle made it a 
personal quest to visit Kandi in Victoria as often as possible, but due 
to the troublesome issue of money (and parental permission) this was 
limited to about once a month. 

Because they saw so little of each other, Janelle and Kandi made every 
second count when they did. Which was why it was so obvious about 
Kandi&#146;s intentions tonight. Both girls smiled to each other as they made 
their way out into the hallway. They ambled through the masses of 
smashed teens sprawled across Summer&#146;s house, then made their way 
upstairs. 

Janelle had reservations about using someone else&#146;s bedroom to &#145;say 
goodbye&#146; to each other. And considering that Janelle, personally, didn&#146;t 
know Summer from Adam (she had come to this party to meet Kandi), it 
made it seem more intrusive. But Janelle just followed along as Kandi 
led her up the flight of stairs, around the upper hallway and into one 
of the four spare bedrooms. 

As they entered, Kandi closed the door behind them and locked it, from 
the silver-tinted latch lock. Then she cast her eyes at Janelle again. 
It was a little bit quieter up here. Though you could still hear fragile 
beats of music and all the laughing and banter from downstairs, this was 
perfect for them. And, if need be, Kandi would apologize to Summer later 
for the use of one of her spare bedrooms. 

Janelle squirmed inside from thinking about this. It was hard sleeping 
with Kandi. Being able to touch her was like heaven. Being able to kiss 
her, to drown in her natural wildflower scent. But then, having to leave 
her once again felt like hell itself. Even though they had ended their 
relationship a while ago... and these sexual &#145;goodbyes&#146; had been taken 
up between them, it didn&#146;t feel... enough.

She wanted 100% of Kandi, 100% of the time. &quot;... It gets harder and 
harder to say goodbye to you, y&#146;know? I can&#146;t keep doing this.&quot;

Kandi sighed, walked up to Janelle, and planted a hand on her soft 
cheek. &quot;... I know, Janny. It&#146;s hard for me too. But... I&#146;d rather have 
this than none of you at all. Can&#146;t we just enjoy this night for... what 
it is?&quot; 

It was quite hard to argue with an argument like that. So Janelle did 
the smart thing. She didn&#146;t bother.  Instead, she slowly worked her 
hands towards Kandi&#146;s neck, through to her elongated masses of red hair. 
Slowly, ever slowly, Janelle titled her head towards the redhead&#146;s. A 
kiss was initiated as soft brown lips met rosy pink ones. Kandi sighed, 
grabbing a hold of Janelle&#146;s waist and embraced her. Their bodies 
juddered. There really is nothing like seizing something after waiting 
so long to have it. And nobody understood that notion more than Kandi 
and Janelle did. 

The redhead focused all of her attention on Janelle&#146;s lips, exchanging 
light kisses then breaking erratically into long ones. But Janelle&#146;s 
hands didn&#146;t stay as they were. Both hands left their posts at Kandi&#146;s 
mane of strawberry blonde hair. Janelle&#146;s hands moved downward, slowly 
brushing against Kandi&#146;s pale skin, then ever downward to her shoulder 
blades. They moved in slow, idle circles. It was as if Janelle were 
trying to re-establish her memory of Kandi&#146;s body. A second moan escaped 
Kandi&#146;s lips, brought along by Janelle&#146;s touch. And the older girl 
wasted no time in exploiting that. With lust-driven speed, Janelle 
widened her lips and titled her head to one side. Her tongue was 
immediately forced through the minimal gap between Kandi&#146;s lips. And 
again, Kandi moaned from the sensation. Her mind ran for the wind as 
Janelle&#146;s tongue probed her mouth. From along the polished white of her 
teeth to the tip of her own tongue. In and out, up and down, Kandi could 
breathe only through her nose as Janelle laid claim to her oral cavity.

It thrilled her immensely to know that Janelle&#146;s tongue was thrusting in 
and out of her mouth. To know that Janelle, her Janelle, was touching 
and enjoying her in ways that no one else would. Kandi moaned her 
arousal into Janelle&#146;s mouth as they mingled. She instinctively wove her 
hands into Janelle&#146;s glossy locks of black hair. In an instant, Janelle 
got the message. The girl kept up their kiss, but slowly ambled them 
towards the bed on the other side of the room. It was a delicate 
process, but they eventually made it. Janelle reluctantly broke their 
kiss, and gently motioned Kandi onto the bed. The redheaded girl landed 
softly on it, her limbs and hair splayed out around her. 

Janelle just took a second, to not only catch her breath, but to observe 
her lover. Kandi was so immensely beautiful. More so than any other girl 
she had ever met. The way Kandi&#146;s long legs were spread openly, looked 
so inviting. The way her sparkling ginger hair contrasted the pure white 
of the bedspread, looked so charming. And the way her small yet pert 
breasts heaved as Kandi drew in breath, looked so tempting. 

Kandi&#146;s voice was breathless and endlessly alluring. &quot;...Make love to 
me...&quot;

Janelle wasted no time. But who could blame her? The swimsuit hottie 
climbed onto the bed, and mounted Kandi from the waist, staring down at 
such a perfect vision of innocent beauty. Her lips quickly sought out 
Kandi&#146;s ones, her kiss more fierce and more demanding. As if this would 
be the last time she ever got to enjoy those sweet lips. Kandi&#146;s breath 
quickened rapidly, and a hot wetness began dampening the cotton white 
panties she had worn to the party. Words could not describe how much 
Janelle excited her. While Kandi continued to moan and writhe under 
Janelle&#146;s passionate lip-lock, she took no notice to the fact that her 
clothes were being removed.

Janelle worked as deliberately slow as possibly, maintaining the kiss 
while at the same time, popping open each button that bound Kandi&#146;s 
breasts from attention. The shirt came undone after two minutes of work, 
and Janelle was with presented with Kandi&#146;s bra-restricted chest. She 
lazily dragged her tongue from inside of Kandi&#146;s open mouth and 
instantly went for the neck, nibbling that tender skin. Janelle moved in 
trails, kissing and biting Kandi down the frame of her neckline. Her 
tongue slid down towards Kandi&#146;s breasts, and Janelle found her chin 
rested comfortably between them. 

Janelle could just picture herself between Kandi&#146;s breasts for the rest 
of her life. No place felt any more comfortable than there. Still, she 
pulled away all the same and attacked the bra again. It unclipped open 
from the front, an obvious indication that Kandi had been planning for 
this. Janelle pulled it from under Kandi&#146;s torso, then tossed it to the 
floor. Before feasting on those two gorgeous mounds, Janelle&#146;s hands 
slid down her body to the bottom of Kandi&#146;s outfit. She took it off. 
This time rather quickly, yanking it free from Kandi&#146;s luscious legs. It 
joined her shirt and bra on the floor and eventually the dampened 
panties, too. In moments Kandi was completely and utterly naked (save 
for her socks), her beautiful body bared for Janelle&#146;s pleasure and 
Janelle&#146;s pleasure alone. 

Kandi shut her eyes, feeling Janelle&#146;s body weight descending on her 
once more. And a gasp escaped her lips as her lover&#146;s tongue flicked at 
her right breast. It ran over the erect nipple, first slowly in speed, 
then faster and faster. Kandi sighed, and ran her hand into Janelle&#146;s 
hair once more. Her hands surrounded the back of Janelle&#146;s head and 
urged her closer, to consume her rosy nipple. Which is what Janelle did. 
Kandi&#146;s nipple and aureole vanished into the taller girl&#146;s mouth. And a 
deeper sigh was expelled from her throat. Her nipples were strangely 
sensitive. Far more than the rest of her body. The stimulation of her 
breasts was almost as powerful to Kandi as the stimulation of her clit. 
Janelle was well aware of that, so was careful not to push Kandi too 
far. If this was going to be the last time they slept with each other 
for a while, might as well make it last. 

Still, Janelle continued to suckle on Kandi&#146;s soft breast, and began to 
massage the other one with her free hand. Kandi&#146;s head collapsed back 
onto the pillow. Her breath grew even sharper, her toes curled under 
themselves and her pussy ached with need. Janelle&#146;s oral attentions 
drove her straight to an edge. But Janelle was knowledgeable in the 
workings of Kandi&#146;s body. And knew when to stop. The girl pulled her 
head back  slowly, her lips freeing from Kandi&#146;s rounded mammary. That 
rosy nipple was now drenched with Janelle&#146;s oral juices. And Janelle 
wanted repayment in kind. She wanted her lips to be swathed in Kandi&#146;s 
vaginal liquids. Just as Janelle began to lower herself down Kandi&#146;s 
body for that gift, the younger girl stopped her.

&quot;W-Wait,&quot; She said, her voice weaker. &quot;I want us to... come together...&quot;

Janelle nodded in reply. &quot;...Sure.&quot;

And so, Janelle acted accordingly. She leaned upright, opening the 
buttons that were fastening her jeans jacket together. It came off 
rather quickly, as did the denim skirt that Janelle was wearing. Once 
those were off, so too did the high heel leather boots follow, until all 
of her clothing was in a crumpled pile next to Kandi&#146;s own. Janelle 
moved herself over Kandi&#146;s laying torso, pulling one of those long legs 
to either side of the redhead&#146;s body. Soon Janelle had positioned 
herself in such a way that her hips were clinging to Kandi&#146;s sides, her 
ass gently brushing by the soft mounds of her chest. Kandi could see 
nothing but her back, and the raven black hair that splashed against 
Janelle&#146;s shoulders. Janelle leaned downwards, and pushed her body back. 
In this way, her face was positioned right above Kandi&#146;s steaming 
crotch, and Janelle&#146;s pussy hung demandingly over Kandi&#146;s face. She had, 
to great effect, motioned them both into the 69 position. Even though 
there was a slight height difference between them, this didn&#146;t effect 
the contact that one of the girls had with the other girl&#146;s opening. 

It was Janelle who began it. Her head titled between Kandi&#146;s thighs, and 
her tongue directly went for her swollen, un-spread labia. Kandi gave a 
throaty cry as she felt this, Janelle&#146;s tongue passing along the moist, 
hairless folds. Her hips squeezed together, locking Janelle&#146;s face in 
place, with the taller girl&#146;s  mop of black hair spread out over Kandi&#146;s 
trembling thighs. What started as a sensual caress via the tongue, 
became something more. Janelle&#146;s long pink digit ran up and down Kandi&#146;s 
damp lips, lapping up the fragrant pre-juice that oozed from the opening 
they guarded. Kandi cried out, and squirmed so that more of Janelle&#146;s 
tongue could reach her. She was so far into it that Kandi had forgotten 
to give Janelle what she deserved, too. 

The redhead girl looked up at Janelle&#146;s swelteringly captivating 
womanhood, obscured by her vulva. A clear musk of arousal centred around 
it, little beads of premature discharge soiling soft, sensitive flesh. 

Kandi was drawn to it. To the smell, the sight, everything. She leaned 
upwards, her head moving up in-sync, then opened her mouth to branch out 
her tongue. With her hands, Kandi parted the two labial creases of 
flesh. And plunged her tongue between them. Janelle shuddered as she 
felt something warm enter her, knowing instinctively what it was. The 
brunette paused, and gave a long awaited grunt of passion, as Kandi&#146;s 
tongue tasted her. Exploring along the inner walls of her sex. Lavishing 
it with her tongue and lips. Janelle moaned into Kandi&#146;s hairless 
crotch, her voice slightly deeper. To think that she had waited months 
for this. Now it was happening, it was finally happening.

Janelle settled her hips, and thus, her snatch, deeper against Kandi&#146;s 
face. Her thighs settled around the shorter girl&#146;s head, while Janelle 
herself resumed her attentions on Kandi. But this time, she focused on 
her hooded clit. The two girls then set about pleasuring each other. 
Their muffled, respective cries soon began filling the room, drowning 
out even the sounds of the booming music and laughter below them. And it 
wasn&#146;t just a desperate act to get laid. Though they would part 
tomorrow, this was an act that the two of them had desired from each 
other for months. And so neither of them could have enjoyed it more than 
they did.

As time passed into the minutes, their lively cries became desperate 
screams, and both were sent over into the throws of shockingly powerful 
orgasms. Simultaneously. Their bodies were sent into individual spasms, 
their breathing ran wild, and their limbs thrashed erratically. Kandi 
and Janelle ceased those screams only to fervently drink the gushing 
discharge that spurted from one girl&#146;s pussy to the other&#146;s mouth. 
Kandi&#146;s mouth pulled away from Janelle&#146;s wet snatch, just to breathe in. 
Her lips were smeared with wetness, and the taste of it hung 
delightfully on her tongue. Janelle followed that action shortly 
afterwards, Kandi&#146;s cum literally dripping from the corners of her 
mouth. 

Janelle slowly rolled off Kandi&#146;s limp body, then ambled around so that 
she lying next to the redhead. Kandi smiled tiredly and rolled onto 
Janelle&#146;s shoulder, snuggling up to each other. And they looked so 
angelic together. They complemented each other so well. In particular 
the way Kandi&#146;s pale flesh melded seamlessly with that of Janelle&#146;s 
light brown. They looked in many ways, perfect.

Kandi sighed as Janelle wrapped an arm around her. &quot;...I&#146;m gonna miss 
you, Janelle.&quot;

**********

&quot;Ha, ha, ha! And I told her that the pop quiz was on Friday! You should 
have seen her face! Ha, ha, ha!&quot;

Debbie giggled softly. &quot;I can imagine.&quot;

This was nice. Just an evening out with a friend. Debbie rolled the tip 
of her finger over the rim of her coffee cup as she listened to Sammi. 
She had almost forgotten that the older woman was a teacher, just like 
herself. Sammi taught Biology over at a school in San Antonio. She 
decided to check out the schools in this area. Mostly because she wanted 
to move into Victoria, but she had also been thinking of transferring 
over to another school due to the higher wage packets on offer. Debbie 
loved the idea of Sammi transferring to Atlantic High. She was a really 
good teacher, with some rather innovative approaches to the job. You 
could see it in her brilliantly designed lesson plans. 

It was one of the reasons why Debbie liked speaking with Sammi. She was 
a very capable educator. Her only weakness, was her frigid stance with 
the students. Sammi had such trouble standing up to them. It was 
understandable, though. Samantha had been teaching younger students for 
most of her career. She had just recently made the transition to high 
school. And she was have a tiny bit of trouble coping with the drastic 
change in attitude. 

Sammi took a sip of her half-empty cup of coffee. &quot;So... what problems 
do you have with your students then, Debbie?&quot;

&quot;Usually,&quot; Debbie responded, &quot;It&#146;s a struggle to just keep them focussed 
on the lesson. Being a History teacher, I have to cope with my kids 
getting bored or tired. Usually I try and find some video sources to 
keep them entertained, then pile on the heavy work later on. I find it 
helps to use masses and masses of visual aids, too.&quot;

Sammi nodded in agreement. &quot;Yeah. My students seem to respond better to 
audio-visual too. Biology books can get fairly tiresome for them, I 
suppose.&quot;

&quot;I think all books have that effect on kids,&quot; Debbie added with a smile. 
&quot;It&#146;s just the way things are these days. If I had more of an option, 
I&#146;d talk to someone about adding more field trips to the yearly 
calendar, but I doubt we&#146;d see the day.&quot;

While Debbie and Sammi continued with idle, cheerful banter, they were 
unaware that someone had just arrived across the road. Someone who had 
been watching them chatter like two long lost friends. That someone was 
Linda. The blonde teacher&#146;s eyes stalked over the two other women, as 
they sat down. Sipping their coffee and nattering about whatever. Linda 
was livid. Her crystal blue eyes clearly reflected the jealousy she was 
feeling. But whatever she was feeling, Linda could easily see what that 
woman was after. 

She was gagging for Debbie. 

You could see it in her actions. From the way she rested her cheek on 
her palm, rolling her eyes up and down Debbie&#146;s upper torso, that 
attraction was obvious. Linda didn&#146;t know who the hell that woman was, 
or even why she was so jealous, but there was no way she was going to 
allow her to make a move on Debbie. Sooner than thinking things through, 
Linda charged over there, stomping in stride. Neither of the two women 
sitting down noticed her until the sound of sharp footsteps approached 
them.

Sammi felt a shadow being cast over her, and looked up to see who it 
was. &quot;Can I... help you?&quot;

Linda cast harsh eyes away from Sammi towards Debbie. &quot;I don&#146;t think you 
can, honey.&quot;

&quot;Linda?&quot; Debbie spoke with confusion, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

The English teacher gave a low chuckle. &quot;Janet called me. Said you were 
meeting someone. She also said I should do something about it. But hey, 
looks like the two of you are cosy enough as it is without me barging 
in. You rebound so well, Debs.&quot;

Debbie was alarmed with Linda&#146;s harsh remarks. It wasn&#146;t a date, and it 
wasn&#146;t a rebound. How little did Linda really think of her? Though her 
eyes were less than quiet, Debbie remained silent, till Sammi stood 
upright.

&quot;Linda, right?&quot; Sammi asked slowly, &quot;Look, this isn&#146;t what you think-&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, sure!&quot; Linda yelled mockingly, so loudly that she drew 
attention from other tables. &quot;Do you think I&#146;m so blind that I can&#146;t see 
what you&#146;re trying to do?!&quot;

Sammi shook her head slowly. &quot;I am not trying to &#145;do&#146; anything. And it&#146;s 
not like it&#146;s any of your business, even if I were. From what I hear, 
you and Debbie aren&#146;t even seeing each other anymore.&quot; 

Linda just ignored that, looking back at Debbie. &quot;Are you really serious 
about this?! Dating some random woman you don&#146;t even know?!&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Sammi piped up, &quot;I&#146;ve known Debbie longer than the two of 
you have been seeing each other, okay? Our relationship has nothing to 
do with you.&quot;

The blonde threw a sharp look at the Biology teacher. &quot;Stay out of this. 
This is none of your concern.&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Sammi corrected. &quot;I&#146;m involved now, whether you like it or 
not. So just calm down and leave us alone.&quot;

Linda chucked darkly, again. &quot;You&#146;re kidding, right? Let me get this 
straight. You seriously expect me to just walk away? To just let this 
roll off my back and go home? You expect me to listen to a complete 
stranger, like you? Some two-bit internet hussie?!&quot;

Sammi scowled. &quot;I don&#146;t have to stand here and take this!&quot;

&quot;Then get lost!&quot; Linda roared, catching the full attention of the people 
at the surrounding tables, not to mention the waitress. &quot;Nobody wants 
you here!&quot;

&quot;You can&#146;t keep me from her!&quot; 

With a jerk of her head, Linda spread her arms open and smirked, as if 
to provoke the Biology teacher. &quot;I&#146;ve got two fists that speak 
differently, baby.&quot;

It was then that Debbie took action. The moment Linda and Sammi squared 
off with each other, Debbie stepped in between them, offering cautious 
glances to them both. &quot;That&#146;s enough! Now just calm down, both of you!&quot;

Though Debbie was between she and the other woman, Linda didn&#146;t stop 
throwing deathly glares in Sammi&#146;s direction. And Sammi was very much 
the same way. It was no secret that the two women hated each other. Even 
though they had only known each other for the best part of three 
minutes. At that moment, Debbie stepped up to Linda, throwing one last 
look at Sammi.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry about this, Sammi.&quot; The educator said. &quot;We&#146;ll have to 
reconvene other day.&quot;

Sammi said nothing, just watched Debbie grab Linda by the wrist and 
virtually drag her away from the midnight caf&eacute;. Linda just found enough 
of her bearings to cast another hateful look in Sammi&#146;s direction. In 
seconds, Linda and Debbie turned a corner around the street, to a more 
secluded area. The moment they got there, Debbie spun Linda around to 
face her.

&quot;I have never been so embarrassed in all my life,&quot; Debbie&#146;s eyes were as 
hard as diamond, and the tone of her voice was very much the same way. 
&quot;Why on earth did you come here? And then go and pull that performance?&quot;

The blonde woman just looked away.

&quot;Answer me, Linda!&quot; Debbie urged. 

Linda rolled her eyes slowly. &quot;Oh, well pardon me. Who am I to get 
pissed off when some floozy tries to get lucky with my girlfriend, eh?&quot;

Debbie lowered her voice, then placed her two hands against Linda&#146;s 
cheeks. They were so warm, so reddened with anger. She had never seen 
Linda like this before. In her heart, Debbie was extremely flattered by 
Linda&#146;s jealousy (not so much by the anger though), but she couldn&#146;t 
understand why the other woman was feeling this way. After all, Linda 
was the one who said, no commitment.

&quot;Why are you acting this way, huh?&quot; Debbie&#146;s voice was now far more 
calm, more sensual, and more understanding. A blind monkey in the dark 
could see that she still had feelings for the English teacher. &quot;I&#146;m not 
interested in Samantha. Not at all. That was one of the first things I 
told her when we met this evening.&quot;

Linda released a cleansing breath. She had never been this angry in all 
her years. &quot;I&#146;m... I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t mean to...&quot;

Debbie smiled a reassuring smile, rubbing her thumbs over Linda&#146;s 
flustered cheeks as she held them. Who would have thought that Linda 
could be so feisty? 

&quot;It&#146;s okay, sweetie. It&#146;s okay. But you have to understand something. 
The only reason any of this is happening is because you can&#146;t commit to 
me. I admit it. I do love you. I feel very strongly about you... but you 
have to figure out how you feel about me, Linda. I can&#146;t have a 
relationship with you if it has no future. Surely, you can understand 
that?&quot;

Linda nodded austerely, relishing Debbie&#146;s sweet touch. &quot;...Yeah. I 
think I do.&quot;

&quot;So you have to make a decision.&quot; The brunette said. &quot;We can be together 
in a committed, loving relationship, or we can end this for good and see 
other people. Make your choice, Linda. Please.&quot;

Nothing else was said. Debbie Harding released the soft hold she had 
upon Linda&#146;s face, then leaned inwards, pressing a brief kiss against 
her left cheek. They separated in that instant, and Debbie walked away, 
giving one last smile of encouragement. And once again, Linda was left 
with a haze of questions. But, in actually, only one question mattered.

Would she commit to Debbie?

Jenny smiled innocently, taking a sip out of the bottle she was 
drinking. Across from her, at the other side of Summer&#146;s living room, 
was a guy that had been giving her the eye all night. Jenny actually 
liked him. Of course, she couldn&#146;t make it seem like that. She would 
just hold out and play her cards right. She was just about to take 
another sip of the drink she was holding, until she saw her two friends 
stumble through the door into the living room. 

Summer and Holly-Raine. 

The two girls walked over to Jenny. But they were acting in a very 
peculiar way. They seemed somehow worn out, or worked, their expressions 
were sort of smirking, and their clothes looked messed up. Especially 
Summer. The moment the two girls reached Jenny, the girl enquired about 
it. 

&quot;What happened to you two?&quot; Jenny asked loudly. &quot;You&#146;re both looking a 
state.&quot;

Summer exchange a knowing glance with Holly-Raine. &quot;...It&#146;s been a... 
very &#145;interesting&#146; night so far.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Holly added, smiling at the birthday girl. &quot;You got that 
right.&quot;

Jenny just shook her head. She still didn&#146;t know what they were talking 
about. But it really didn&#146;t matter, as long as Summer was enjoying her 
party. &quot;Well, whatever you guys. Anyways, you see that guy over there?&quot;

Summer and Holly-Raine looked over in the direction that Jenny just 
happened to point at. Summer was the first to respond when she looked 
back at Jenny. &quot;Yeah, what about him?&quot;

&quot;I think he likes me!&quot; Jenny said with a giggle. &quot;He&#146;s been staring at 
me all night.&quot;

Holly titled her head to the side. &quot;You want me to set the two of you 
up? I could just go over there, talk to him and arrange it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#146;t you dare...!&quot; Jenny said, blushing. &quot;You know what I&#146;m like with 
guys...&quot;

Summer just rolled her eyes. &quot;Yeah, I do. This guy likes you, Jenny. You 
are not backing out of this. C&#146;mon. Just leave it to me.&quot;

The birthday girl then grabbed her friend by the hand and took her 
across the living room to the boy that had been checking Jenny out. 
Holly-Raine laughed sweetly at the expression on both Summer and Jenny&#146;s 
faces. She was eternally grateful that she had those two as her friends. 
And even more grateful that her encounter with Summer would not effect 
their friendship whatsoever.

Chris Angel says,

* This chapter was a little different from others. And a bit longer than 
I intended it to be as well. Still, I enjoyed writing it. It was more 
about the story than sex this time around, I&#146;m hoping that&#146;s okay.

* I liked the pairing that Kandi/Janelle made. It was sort of refreshing 
to write a sexual encounter between two people that *actually* seem to 
care about each other. Like I think I said at the start of the chapter, 
Kandi will appear in her own Misadventures series once I&#146;m finished with 
Holly-Raine. 

* Thanks to all for the requests! Two were primarily carried out in this 
chapter. One being Janelle, the Swimsuit Hottie (written at the request 
of Anna. D, I&#145;m hoping you don&#146;t mind me making Kandi your girl ^_^ ), 
and the second being Alyshia (thanks for that too!). I really enjoy 
writing out the requests my readers have, so keep tossing &#145;um to me, 
people! ^_^
