<a href="../original/angelgift-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>        Allison was getting ready for bed when the phone rang out into 
the quiet of the penthouse suite. Marilyn and Roma were both out, 
Milly was cleaning up the kitchen, and Allison had heard Jenna 
puttering about in the bedroom. &quot;Yes?&quot; she asked, picking it up. 
Allison had, rather reluctantly, given out Jenna&#39;s number to her 
friends, so it was quite possibly for her.

        &quot;Hey, boss,&quot; Kat&#39;s cheerful voice came over the line loud and 
clear, &quot;did I interrupt you and Jenna in a romantic moment?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s nothing to interrupt,&quot; Allison said through grit 
teeth. &quot;What was it you wanted?&quot; she asked her impatiently.

        &quot;I would have you know,&quot; Kat sounded a just bit indignant as 
she continued on dramatically, &quot;that I have personally solved our 
serious personnel problem in the shop! They&#39;ll be in the bookstore 
tomorrow for you to meet them.&quot;

        Allison felt a deep surge of relief, &quot;Good work!&quot; She&#39;s been 
covering extra shifts the last while along with Kat, all because they 
weren&#39;t able to find reliable help.

        &quot;See you tomorrow,&quot; Kat said cheerfully, and disconnected.

        As Allison put the phone back down on it&#39;s receiver, she 
realized that she had completely forgotten to ask about the new 
employees. &#39;Oh, well,&#39; she thought, stretching out a bit, &#39;I guess 
I&#39;ll find out about them tomorrow.&#39; She walked towards the bedroom but 
stopped to look out the window up at the twinkling stars.

        A few moments later Allison was startled out of her thoughts 
by a softly spoken, &quot;They&#39;re very beautiful, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Jenna had 
come up to stand at her side, looking up through the glass at the 
night sky.

        Allison looked over at the dark haired woman and for a few 
moments was stunned by her beauty. It wasn&#39;t just Jenna&#39;s good looks, 
the finely formed face, the waves of long black hair, or the sculpted 
body, it was a combination of all those things, coupled with the 
warmest, kindest personality that Allison had ever net.

        &quot;They&#39;re not as beautiful as you,&quot; Allison said softly.

        Jenna seemed startled a moment, then a happy smile appeared on 
her face as she murmured softly, &quot;Thank you, Allison.&quot; She leaned into 
her side, looking up at her with a sweet little smile, then she 
reached up to cup Allison&#39;s chin as Jenna said, &quot;And you are a 
handsome devil.&quot;

        Allison blushed faintly and softly admitted, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;ll ever get used to someone calling me handsome.&quot;

        Jenna shrugged, &quot;It&#39;s true, m&#39;love.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Allison said softly.

        Jenna hesitated a moment, then she stepped forward and gently 
pressed her body to Allison&#39;s before she kissed her gently on the 
lips. &quot;See you in bed,&quot; she smiled, and walked down the hall to the 
bedroom they shared.

        &#39;I&#39;m straight,&#39; Allison tried to remind herself firmly, but 
somehow the thought seemed to emerge more like a question. A few 
minutes later she hesitantly ventured down the hall, pushing open the 
bedroom door and stepping inside.

        &quot;Allison, are you going to get changed for bed?&quot; Jenna asked, 
turning towards her so that the nightgown she was wearing swirled 
slightly.

        A soft gulp was the only answer Allison could manage. The gown 
was long enough, covering all the essentials, but it was gauzelike, 
and Jenna was lit by the lamp light to make it almost entirely 
transparent. Underneath that, Jenna seemed to have neglected to wear 
her bra and panties.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Jenna asked Allison softly.

        &quot;Uh, right, change for bed,&quot; Allison stammered out. She picked 
up her folded pair of pajamas and quickly retreated to the attached 
bathroom to change, only to be stopped by a gentle hand resting on her 
shoulder. She turned to see Jenna&#39;s concerned gaze, and tried not to 
look down at the breasts that Jenna&#39;s gown so clearly highlighted.

        &quot;You don&#39;t have to leave to get changed,&quot; Jenna said softly.

        Allison fought back an blush, &quot;I&#39;m.. shy.&quot;

        Jenna gave Allison a gentle smile and her voice was almost 
teasing as she said, &quot;Unless my people&#39;s understanding of your anatomy 
is very wrong, you don&#39;t have anything that I don&#39;t have.&quot; A soft 
laugh, &quot;It&#39;ll be all right.&quot;

        Jenna fumbled a moment with Allison&#39;s tie and she reached up 
to help her, their fingers brushing together gently. The buttons of 
the white shirt and cuffs came undone quickly, and Jenna helped 
Allison shrug it off.

        Letting the blushing Allison keep the bra for modesty&#39;s sake 
she undid the slim leather belt, drawing it through the loops gently. 
The top button was undone, and the zipper slid on down, the pants 
swiftly pooling at Allison&#39;s bare feet.

        &quot;Jenna, I...&quot; Allison started.

        &quot;Shhh,&quot; Jenna shushed her gently. The pajamas forgotten, she 
gently pulled the slim young woman over to the bed, where they lay 
down side by side.

        The next morning, and Allison was still blushing faintly as 
she walked down the street towards her bookstore, Jenna holding onto 
her arm and cuddling to her side. &#39;I can&#39;t believe I did that,&#39; she 
thought to herself dazedly.

        The doorbell rang as Allison gentlemanly pushed the door open 
for Jenna then followed her inside. Kat looked up from where she was 
sorting books and smiled at Jenna. She got a good look at Allison and 
her eyes grew wide.

        &#39;What?&#39; Allison thought frantically.

        Kate grabbed Allison&#39;s arm and dragged her away eve as she 
said to Jenna, &quot;Excuse us, I need to ask her something about the 
shop.&quot; Jenna waved cheerfully, but once they were far enough away Kat 
eagerly asked Allison, &quot;What happened? Something happened, didn&#39;t it?&quot;

        &#39;Damn this blush,&#39; Allison thought to herself even as she 
quickly answered her, &quot;Nothing happened. Nothing at all!&quot;

        Kat gave her a skeptical look, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;

        Still blushing, Allison admitted, &quot;She helped me get ready for 
bed.&quot; Kat obviously expected more, and after a few more seconds of 
glare she added, &quot;She helped me undress.&quot;

        &quot;Heh, not bad,&quot; Kat grinned, &quot;at least Jenna&#39;s making a bit of 
progress with you!&quot;

        &quot;Oh, goddess,&quot; Allison blushed.

        Kat raised her eyebrow, &quot;I thought you didn&#39;t believe in...&quot;

        &quot;At this point,&quot; Allison sighed, &quot;I&#39;ll try anything.&quot;

        Out in the shop they heard Jenna cry out, &quot;Marilyn, Roma. What 
are you two doing here?&quot;

        Allison could be slow occasionally, but not right then. She 
looked at Kat desperately and asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t!&quot;

        &quot;Well, they both needed jobs,&quot; Kat grinned, &quot;and it&#39;s not like 
they can run off and leave us in a lurch with their ship busted.&quot;

        Allison just sighed softly.
