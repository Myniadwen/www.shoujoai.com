<h1>All Girls School (part 14 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;Abi, Abby, and Sarah: Time Off&quot;

On their days off, most of the teachers in Stanton spent time alone or 
with their loved ones. Abi Cerio always liked to have somebody with 
her&#151;she was a social bird by nature&#151;and since she had gone through the 
trouble of asking if a few of her fellow instructors would be busy the 
following weekend, two had said no and gone with her.

Now Cerio was a flirt by nature and radically attracted to women, so her 
motives were two-sided. She loved diving into social situations and she 
loved diving into sex or sexual encounters (as a rule, she never got 
around to intercourse until the 8th date), and although neither Ms. 
Keeping or Miss Johansson appeared to be her type, she still invited 
them over to a nice spa she knew for a few hours of pampering.

Sarah Johansson, the music teacher, went because she was just as 
outgoing as Cerio, although her interest in the other woman was purely 
friendly. Abigail Keeping, the psychology teacher, knew she had to get 
out somehow, so she went and accompanied the younger women into the spa. 
There would be absolutely no chemistry between any of the three women, 
although Cerio would still flirt regardless (to differentiate between 
Keeping and Cerio, they settled on addressing themselves as Abi and 
Gail).

Keeping loved montages, and if she had been an outside observer watching 
a film of her outing with the younger women, she would&#39;ve seen one, and 
with good reason. They had mud baths and massages, long talks and steam 
baths, flirts and fruit-snacks, and (though it would have been edited 
from the montage) had seen each other naked enough times to be 
desensitized from it in any future encounter.

&quot;Do you do this often?&quot; asked Sarah of Abi while the trio rested in the 
sauna. They had colored towels on, but they wouldn&#39;t stay.

&quot;Do what? Oh, go to a spa? No, not really. Maybe bi-monthly, or whenever 
I feel like I&#39;ve been haranguing too long. It&#39;s not like me to keep 
stress inside for long.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I&#39;ve never done anything the like. You, Gail?&quot; Keeping parted her 
hair from her ears, staring intently at the wall as she spoke.

&quot;I used to, but that was way back in college. I want to thank you for 
this, Abi, but why so nice to us? We barely know each other and frankly, 
I feel like a third wheel.&quot;

&quot;I love being with people, that&#39;s all I can say,&quot; explained the youngest 
of the three. &quot;Besides, Sarah and I being the newest to the group, I&#39;d 
say it&#39;s warranted that we acquaint with the veteran faculty.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a nice way to say that I&#39;m old.&quot;

&quot;Oh, bullshit, you&#39;re not even thirty yet. I&#39;ve went out with lots of 
women who would make you feel like a child.&quot; (Abi had told them both how 
she felt towards women, and at first, this outright frankness attracted 
Sarah, who felt the same. She quickly realized that although Cerio was a 
bit of an imp, she was perhaps too sweet and showy for her)

&quot;Are you seeing anyone now?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well, no, I&#39;m really not. I&#39;ve been going into and out of flings here 
and there. I&#39;d have to say that if I wanted to go searching, I&#39;d like to 
date an older woman, one who knows what she&#39;s doing. Besides, there 
aren&#39;t many legal younger girls out there, and I&#39;m stuck with my youth 
for awhile.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; said Keeping, &quot;you&#39;d be interested in...&quot;

&quot;Not you, dear,&quot; assured Abi politely. &quot;I like you and you&#39;re very 
gorgeous, but I&#39;ve a feeling you&#39;re not into women.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Keeping smiled knowingly and blushed. Oho, if only the little 
novice knew!

&quot;You, Sarah Jo?&quot; inquired Abi, looking into the Swede&#39;s direction. She 
expanded with, &quot;Anyone you&#39;re interested in?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll first say that I think it&#39;s odd that two lesbians are in a steam 
room together with only their towels on and yet they appear to act quite 
civil and, uh, generous to each other.&quot;

&quot;Well we can&#39;t be attracted to everyone.&quot;

&quot;Point taken. And the third hasn&#39;t been hit on once.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m smart enough to see that it&#39;d make her uncomfortable.&quot;

&quot;You can,&quot; noted Keeping casually, &quot;it&#39;s just that it won&#39;t ever be 
returned.&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s the fun in that?&quot; Abi and Sarah smiled at each other. The 
youngest one whistled in exhaustion and stood up. &quot;Whew! Ladies, you 
mind if I take this towel off? Would it be okay? Would you...&quot; Keeping 
nodded.

&quot;Go ahead, we&#39;ll probably do the same.&quot; Cerio smiled and with a heave of 
relief, disrobed. As promised, the other two fell off as well, and 
despite seeing them as respectful friends, Abi couldn&#39;t help but smile 
in satisfaction at what she saw.

&quot;You&#39;re both quite excellent.&quot;

&quot;Uh, thanks.&quot; A piercing laughter broke through the room.

&quot;Was that flirty? I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no offense. I&#39;m used to people telling me I&#39;m pretty.&quot; Cerio 
grinned and turned to Sarah.

&quot;You&#39;re pretty too!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not my type.&quot;

&quot;Darn.&quot; Again, laughter.

&quot;Okay, answer me this,&quot; spoke Sarah after a few minutes of idle chatter 
passed. &quot;If it weren&#39;t illegal, and it wouldn&#39;t cost you your job or 
reputation, would you date one of your students?&quot; Only Keeping had to 
really think about it; Abi knew instantly.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Not me,&quot; admitted Sarah. &quot;I&#39;d date a girl that age, yes, just not... It 
would be embarrassing and awkward!&quot; The younger ones turned to Abigail, 
who still pondered in her nude suit.

&quot;I don&#39;t really know,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;I have a feeling that even if 
it were okay, most of my students would be against it. I don&#39;t even 
really like any of them that way. Even if I were their age, it wouldn&#39;t 
happen.&quot;

&quot;You sure? Who do you have?&quot;

&quot;Uh, let&#39;s see...&quot; Abigail, and eventually, each of the three women 
rounded off their students, or tried to, and the conversation turned to 
them. Sarah had the least; Abi had the most, but probably because her 
subject was the only one required by the state.

&quot;Do you suspect any of them of being lesbians?&quot; asked Sarah. Cerio 
shrugged.

&quot;Oh, I know for a fact that at least one is.&quot;

&quot;A fact?&quot;

&quot;She confided it in me,&quot; answered Cerio&#151;in truth, though, she knew 
because she had slept with that student. &quot;I have suspicions about two,&quot; 
she resumed, &quot;but the rest probably aren&#39;t. But what do I know? What 
about you two?&quot;

&quot;That isn&#39;t something that concerns me,&quot; answered Keeping. &quot;And in any 
case, I think that any relationship should have a strong founding and a 
long history behind it. Case in point, say I wanted to start dating a 
good male friend of mine. Neither of us would find this awkward, but 
we&#39;d know it couldn&#39;t get too far too fast. But then again, on the other 
hand, a stranger could be nice because of the development factor.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean... we wouldn&#39;t know each other, so we&#39;d get to know each other. 
Our mothers and grandmothers called it &#39;courting&#39;; I&#39;d guess we&#39;d call 
it extra-personal acquaintanceship. The younger generation&#39;d call it... 
well, there are a hundred names for it.&quot;

The three women were silent for a long time, but probably because they 
had ran out of things to talk about.

&quot;So what is your type, Sarah?&quot; spoke Abigail. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind my 
asking.&quot; Johansson smiled.

&quot;I like the dangerous type. My ideal woman would be a short-haired, 
athletic biker-type woman with a spark in her eyes, a snigger on her 
lips, and a firm, in-control grip. She&#39;d be a demon in the sack but 
sweet when I&#39;d need her to be.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a fantasy woman,&quot; mumbled Abi. &quot;I mean, of course it is, it&#39;s 
your fantasy, but odds are that she doesn&#39;t exist. You should try to 
compromise, and don&#39;t underestimate a woman that seems to be a 
goody-goody. I myself try and date or socialize as much as I can; I 
don&#39;t believe I have a type. What about you, Gail? What kind of man or 
woman are you into?&quot; Abigail Keeping steepled her fingers and leaned 
forward, keeping a catty smile.

&quot;No comment.&quot;

............

The day at the spa went well and ended well, with the three teachers 
parting and two promising to meet again later: Abi had asked &quot;Gail&quot; on a 
date, and since she really wasn&#39;t doing anything, the older woman 
agreed. It would probably end up being friendly and barely intimate 
enough to count, but at least it was a distraction and a good way to get 
out more often. Abigail hated being confined in her small home, and she 
didn&#39;t have too many friends outside of a small loose circle.

In truth, Abigail had her eyes on one woman already&#151;she had for quite 
some time. She knew that most of the students did as well, but few of 
them would have any kind of chance. Gail&#39;s &quot;crush&quot; was prudent about 
relationships and knew very well what consequences would draw from them. 
So what if she had not been in a serious one for some time, or even with 
another woman for a longer time? She still knew how to play the big game 
and she played it well: very well, very slowly, and with great care. She 
had been disappointed twice; the third would have to be treated gently.

Her next psychology class not scheduled to start for awhile, Keeping 
walked over to the room where her object of admiration and one-sided 
love taught, and waited for her to appear. The class ended not long 
after she arrived, and several waves of girls came out, some of them 
much more polite and cheery to their teacher than others. One stayed 
behind and seemed to be engaged in secret or intimate conversation with 
her teacher, and though Abigail hated herself for spying, she couldn&#39;t 
help but notice that teacher and student shared an embrace. Her heart 
briefly wailed as she considered what was happening. The girl in 
question was an albino.

&quot;Good afternoon, Abby,&quot; greeted the woman once she realized she had 
company. Keeping smiled politely and put her suspicions on hold.

&quot;Hi, Hitomi. Busy so far?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, plenty. And you?&quot;

&quot;I have no complaints. I went to a spa recently and got a lot of stress 
off my back.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?! Did you like it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes. You should go sometime.&quot; Abigail&#39;s crush, Hitomi Madsen, 
smiled.

&quot;I could never go by myself, and I don&#39;t know who else would go with 
me.&quot;

&quot;I would.&quot; Madsen smiled again.

&quot;That&#39;s very generous of you, but I&#39;ll be busy for several weekends. 
Sometime next month, perhaps.&quot;

&quot;All right. Oh, is your next class starting soon?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is. You should go to yours as well. Maybe later we can have a 
better discussion.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot; The women smiled and parted with two waves, Keeping 
letting out a sigh she had, well, kept. That went well.

............

The date with Abi Cerio that weekend had went just as Keeping expected. 
Abi was flirtatious and touchy, but on the whole she was friendly and 
polite, and certainly didn&#39;t ooze the sexuality she was rumored to. 
Maybe she saw the &quot;other&quot; Abby as just an older friend, one not inclined 
to feel so attracted to women, at least those not of her type. Cerio 
committed a faux pas later that evening by telling, or confining in 
Abigail, who she really had her eye on (at least during that month).

&quot;So you&#39;re telling your date who you&#39;d like to go on a date with?&quot;

&quot;Well, I won&#39;t if you&#39;re serious about us.&quot; Abigail smiled cordially, 
not feeling the least bit offended.

&quot;I&#39;m not. I just find it weird.&quot;

&quot;Ah. Well, let&#39;s just say that I like you enough to be honest.&quot; Abi 
paused, then leaned in close to whisper her devilish secret into the 
older woman&#39;s ear: &quot;I&#39;d really like to go out with Janna Raulson.&quot;

&quot;...The history teacher?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; grinned Cerio. &quot;She&#39;s very beautiful and well put-together, if 
you take my meaning. I know she&#39;s smart enough for me, and word has it 
that she likes younger women.&quot; Abigail shook her head in wonder.

&quot;My, my...&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; she pressed. &quot;I picked up some hints in the sauna. You 
were nude but not entirely naked, if you take my meaning, and I could 
see you had something to hide. So, come out with it! Are you a lesbian?&quot; 
Keeping just laughed.

&quot;I can&#39;t be considered gay if I&#39;m only attracted to one woman!&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s true!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not!&quot; she insisted, irritated at how childish Abi seemed. &quot;Look, 
I&#39;m not gay, I&#39;m really not. In my whole life I&#39;ve only been genuinely 
attracted to three women, so I don&#39;t think it counts. I&#39;d have to be&#151;&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay, I get it.&quot; Abi laughed and gave her friend a sideways hug, 
wrapping her arm across her shoulder. &quot;So your foot&#39;s in the water but 
you&#39;re not quite wet, is that it?&quot;

&quot;You could put it that way.&quot;

&quot;All right, so who is it? Come on, I told you mine.&quot; Abi was now 
literally clinging onto the older woman, begging like some middle school 
girl who had just heard her best friend got laid the other night.

&quot;All right, all right,&quot; sighed Keeping, &quot;if it&#39;ll keep you off my back, 
it&#39;s... Hitomi.&quot;

There was only one Hitomi in the whole school, so Cerio knew who it was.

&quot;Madsen?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I&#39;ve had a crush on her for a few years.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t say I blame you. She&#39;s real hot, and smart to boot.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Abi gave her older friend a quirky smile and pushed her.

&quot;So? Talk to her!&quot;

&quot;I did.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re getting together sometime next month.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, better late than never.&quot; Keeping just shrugged, and the two 
kept silent except for idle chatter for the rest of the date. Because 
she was the elder, Abigail drove Abi home and saw her inside.

&quot;Let me ask you one more thing,&quot; said Cerio as she leaned against her 
door. &quot;When was the last time you kissed a girl?&quot;

&quot;A friend&#39;s wedding when I was 23, four years ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh, ouch. That&#39;s too long.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;ve never had sex, either. That&#39;s about as far as I&#39;ve ever been.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Abby...&quot; Abi gave her a look of pity, as if it were shameful to go 
so long without any kind of romance. Keeping just laughed.

&quot;That&#39;s in terms of women. I&#39;ve had a few boyfriends since then, so it&#39;s 
not like I&#39;m wasting away.&quot; Abi gave a playful snort and pulled the 
older woman close to her.

&quot;Well, something has to be done about it. Here, let me&#151;&quot;

&quot;Abi...&quot; Cerio placed her mouth on Keeping&#39;s lips, holding it there for 
a time. Not finding it unpleasant, Abigail simply held on and waited 
until it finished, and smiled in thanks.

&quot;So much for my record.&quot;

&quot;Hush. G&#39;night, Abigail.&quot;

&quot;G&#39;night, Abianne.&quot; The women smiled and parted with a wave, and Keeping 
returned to her car. With a few hours to spare, she drove back home and 
found her way to the bathroom, where she disrobed and showered before 
retiring to a book and bed.</pre>
