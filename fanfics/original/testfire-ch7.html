<a href="../original/testfire-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The cycle smoothly slid into the improvised gas station sitting there 
nearby Hastings and Commercial, the battered tanker truck resting on the 
empty industrial lot. Jack Scott climbed off her bile smoothly, her 
sandy brown hair falling into bright blue eyes as she scanned the area 
around her cautiously, ready to move if needed.
 
&quot;Gasoline, Miss?&quot; the older man asked, sitting on a battered chair by 
the hose connected to the back of the fuel tanker.
 
&quot;How much is it?&quot; Jack asked him warily, reaching into a inner pocket of 
her leather jacket for her money pouch.
 
&quot;Gold mark,&quot; he shrugged, his white hair wild and messy. Not far behind 
three younger men stood guard, carrying heavy lead pipes in case anyone 
decided to just take the gas and not pay.
 
&quot;Used to be half,&quot; Jack frowned. He took the hose and splashed a bit ion 
the ground, confirming for Jack that it really was gasoline, then once 
she gave him the coin he began to pump.
 
&quot;Haven&#39;t seen you around,&quot; the older man noted as he pumped, &quot;or that 
bike you&#39;re on. You just moved here?&quot;
 
&#39;Well well, someone who doesn&#39;t know me,&#39; Jack thought, feeling 
pleasantly surprised. &quot;Jack,&quot; she answered, &quot;just moved back to town.&quot;
 
&quot;Fred,&quot; he said as he drew the hose out, shaking a bit to make sure the 
last drops fell into her tank, &quot;swing by again when you need more.&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jack gave a small smile as she screwed the cap back on then 
swung aboard, pulling out onto Hastings and headed west for downtown. It 
didn&#39;t take long to pass her temporary lodgings at the Victoria, then 
she slowed a bit as she reached Main and entered the Shogun&#39;s territory.
 
The old Woodwards building was only a street or two up Hastings, the 
building nearly taking up the next entire block. Once just a big store, 
it had been converted to a mix of housing, offices and storefronts back 
before the comet hit. Because of modern construction and reinforcement 
it had held up well to the years or rioting and madness, only the first 
floor had been badly damaged in the chaos.
 
Out front people lingered as Jack pulled up in her bike, watching her 
curiously as she got off. &quot;Don&#39;t mess with the bike,&quot; she cautioned them 
all calmly as she strode to the entrance, &quot;if you aren&#39;t lucky the booby 
trap can be lethal.&quot;
 
The manager was waiting as she went in, the same man she had known back 
in the old days. Mike&#39;s long brown hair was tied back, a few more lines 
creasing his face, but he still looked much the same. &quot;About time you 
got here,&quot; he grumbled, turning to lead her to the stairs.
 
&quot;Nice to see you, too,&quot; Jack answered, entirely unruffled by his 
abrasive manner.
 
&quot;Hmph,&quot; he grumbled, stomping onward. Mike pushed the door open to the 
second floor, &quot;You look like shit.&quot;
 
&quot;So I lost some weight,&quot; Jack shrugged. They walked down the hall as she 
asked, &quot;I was wondering if I could get my old office, and maybe the room 
I used to rent...&quot;
 
Mike stopped cold, looking down at her in pure amusement. &quot;I kept them 
both open, Jack,&quot; he answered with a smirk, &quot;just like you left &#39;em.&quot; He 
barked a laugh, &quot;Well, except for having a friend clean them up a bit, 
anyway.&quot;
 
&quot;Wait a minute, why?&quot; Jack blinked in surprise.
 
Mike barked a laugh, &quot;Jack, you&#39;re an idiot. You saved my life twice,&quot; 
he started off suddenly, making Jack hurry to catch up, &quot;not to mention 
helping my security hold off that idiot Bannon&#39;s people when they tried 
that territory snatch and grab.&quot;
 
&quot;They were shooting at me, too,&quot; Jack shrugged uncomfortably.
 
&quot;Whatever,&quot; Mike just shrugged before saying, &quot;the place is yours if you 
want it, under same deal that we had before.&quot;
 
&quot;Rent has to have gone up since then,&quot; Jack frowned up at him as she 
added firmly, &quot;I want to be paying the going rate.&quot;

&quot;Considering the tensions between Bannon and the Shogun this isn&#39;t the 
safest place,&quot; Mike answered with a sigh, &quot;I can&#39;t really raise rates 
much.&quot;
 
&quot;Bannon&#39;s ambitious,&quot; Jack agreed, thinking of her last courier trip.
 
&quot;Here we go,&quot; Mike said as they reached the corner office.
 
The door had frosted glass, an indulgence Jack had paid for years back, 
with &#39;Jack Scott, Investigations, Negotiations, Problem Resolution&#39; 
inscribed on it. She pulled her old keys from her pocket and slipped the 
right key in, smiling slightly when it opened with a soft click. The 
hinges were quiet, obviously oiled, and while it was a bit stale inside 
the place was spotlessly clean.
 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jack said softly, her voice rough with emotion.
 
&quot;I&#39;ll let you get settled in,&quot; Mike answered with a wry little smile, 
&quot;come down to my office later if you change your mind.&quot; With that he was 
gone, striding away with a bounce to his step.
 
&#39;I&#39;d have to be a fool to change my mind about staying,&#39; Jack thought, 
looking around fondly. The old carpet was comfortable as she ran her 
hand along the wall to the old filing cabinets. They rattled as they 
opened, empty as when she had left. The desk was battered but familiar, 
the dust that lingered swept away with a wave of her hand. Jack settled 
into her chair, swinging to sit behind her desk as she put her elbows on 
the scarred surface.
 
Outside the view was familiar, the street below and the older region of 
Vancouver just beyond. Gastown was mostly abandoned now, the old 
buildings burned and battered by riots and chaos, but they still had a 
sorrowful beauty to them. Out in the distance the ocean waited, battered 
but still serviceable docks bringing ships in from up and down the west 
coast.
 
&quot;My home,&quot; Jack murmured as she got up, walking over to the other door.
 
She unlocked it too, walking into the large second office that she had 
converted to a set of sleeping quarters. A couch with a hideabed, mini 
kitchen and a battered computer/entertainment system were all as she had 
left them. With a happy sigh jack flopped down onto the couch, coughing 
in surprise as dust flew up around her.
 
&quot;Not exactly how I left it,&quot; Jack choked, rushing over to a window and 
getting to open. &quot;Going to need to do some dusting,&quot; she smiled wryly, 
listening to the noises of the street. Horses hooves, bicycles and the 
occasional motor vehicle rang out, mixed with the sounds of human 
traffic. A flier whizzed by the window, then a streak raced through the 
crowds as a speedster ran along.
 
The sound of knocking brought Jack to the office, noting a figure 
standing outside the main door. Old reflexes had her sitting behind her 
desk then she called out, &quot;Come in.&quot;
 
He leaned on a cane, glasses gleaming on the end of his nose as he 
stepped inside, his clothes crisp and neat. With a practiced eye Jack 
scanned him for concealed weapons, but none were visible his clothing 
laying smooth on his lean form. His hair was white and thinning, face 
oddly unlined despite his appearance of advanced age.
 
&quot;Ms. Scott,&quot; he nodded, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time.&quot;
 
&quot;Mr. Davison,&quot; Jack offered a half bow to him in respect as she asked, 
&quot;how is your master, the Shogun, today?&quot;
 
&quot;Quite well,&quot; Davison answered calmly.
 
The Shogun&#39;s man, Davison was unusual in that he was one of the few that 
were not Asian by birth. Still, the Shogun rewarded signs of loyalty, 
not race, and Davison had proven himself more than once to the man. The 
last time Jack saw him he had been one of the Lieutenants, the leaders 
two steps below their master, and it wouldn&#39;t have surprised her to see 
him rise to a greater rank.
 
&quot;So,&quot; Jack leaned forward to study him thoughtfully, &quot;take a seat, can I 
get you anything?&quot;
 
Once he sat and politely turned down the offer Davison looked at her 
curiously, &quot;Your being here, are you intending to return to your old 
business?&quot;
 
&quot;For the time being, at least,&quot; Jack admitted. She asked him, &quot;What can 
I do for you, sir?&quot;
 
&quot;I have a bit of a private commission for you,&quot; Davison admitted, his 
eyes narrowing slightly in anger. &quot;A good time girl I&#39;ve been known to 
frequent,&quot; he said uncomfortably, &quot;was assaulted recently, and I want 
you to protect her.&quot;
 
&quot;You think it&#39;s connected to you?&quot; Jack asked. Gently she added, &quot;If 
they pick up the wrong sort of trick, things can happen....&quot;
 
&quot;They told her specifically to send their regards to Davison,&quot; he 
answered bleakly.
 
&quot;Then yes, I&#39;d say it&#39;s personal,&quot; Jack nodded. She looked at him 
thoughtfully, &quot;I take it you know who did this?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Davison nodded, &quot;and I&#39;ll have it dealt with soon. I just want 
her safe while I do it.&quot;
 
&quot;My standard rate is ten gold marks a day plus expenses,&quot; Jack said 
crisply, &quot;once I take the retainer, I&#39;m yours.&quot;</pre>
