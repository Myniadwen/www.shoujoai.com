Alisha Fox stared at herself in the mirror and sighed. She felt like 
Atlas, the weight of the world on her shoulders. What a year. It was 
already mid-May, and Prom was just a few hours away. Soon she would be 
dressed and dancing, and then after that, the finals, and graduation. 
Alisha Fox was going to graduate. She was going to be among the class of 
2005. She would truly be an independent woman, free to do whatever she 
wanted&#151;maybe too free. It was all happening so fast. Where had the time 
gone? Had it really been that long since she first stood in front of 
this mirror, proud at herself for coming out to her family? Or even 
before that, when she was just a child, seeing this reflective glass for 
the first time?

She groused. Of all the days for Prom to fall on. She was having her 
monthly period, and she wasn&#39;t in a good mood. Erica was already with 
Jocelyn, tittering away. Lousy bitches. Why should they be so close, 
anyway? Joss dumps Erica, and they stay best friends, and now she wants 
the girl back all of a sudden? No, no, that was her cramps talking; 
Alisha was happy for her sister. And it wasn&#39;t like she was going to 
Prom alone: she had the dark-skinned goddess Olivia Johnson as her date. 
By all means, she should&#39;ve been happy, but she wasn&#39;t. Even if she was 
in perfect health, she wouldn&#39;t feel happy. It was just too much. She 
felt too heavy...

&quot;Sis?&quot; A knock came at the bathroom door, Erica&#39;s patient fist. Alisha 
sighed. &quot;You okay? You&#39;ve been in there a long time.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; she answered grittily. &quot;You know how these periods are. I 
need some &#145;me time&#39;.&quot; Erica slowly relented and told her sister to take 
her time. Alisha felt exhausted and brimmed with pinching pain. 
Ow&#151;ow&#151;everything hurt. She winced. Ow. She might be better off wearing 
barbed wire in her panties. Ow&#151;&quot;Shit,&quot; she muttered. Sigh. She felt 
awful, but...it was Prom. She was obligated to go. She had been planning 
this day for three years, and though her date was different than what 
she originally thought (Olivia instead of Erica), she had to go through 
with it. It was her last chance. Bracing herself, she did what she had 
to do and bit the proverbial bullet.

&quot;Erica?&quot; she called. &quot;Could you do me a favor?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Could you like lay my dress out for me? I&#39;m coming out now.&quot;

&quot;Oh, okay. Are you feeling better?&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she said, more to herself. &quot;But I&#39;ll live. Wouldn&#39;t wanna 
disappoint my girlfriend.&quot;

......

It took her about fifteen minutes to get dressed, and another ten to 
doll herself up. Since Olivia was attracted to redheads, Alisha kept her 
original copper hair color and let it hang loose, all over her 
shoulders. She wore a red dress with straps, but didn&#39;t put too much 
stock in her appearance since she didn&#39;t believe she&#39;d wear all that 
stuff for long&#151;heh-heh! When she displayed herself to her family, Erica 
smiled and said she looked gorgeous, her parents applauded, and even 
Jocelyn whistled. Now that that little debacle was over with, it was 
time to pick up her date. Olivia was with her friends; they had all 
congregated at the O&#39;Shannon residence, girlfriends and all, and awaited 
for the convoy to be completed.

And of course, Alisha felt her cramps the whole way there. But her 
arrival smoothed things out: Gabrielle and Lilian were already out, 
showing off their respective green and black dresses (the same things 
they wore for Nachtheim&#39;s formal birthday party). Usha was finished and 
waiting for her girlfriend; she looked beautiful in red, but dressed 
even more conservatively than Alisha, like she was going to one of her 
snooty parties and not the Prom. Olivia, Alisha learned, was still 
getting ready, probably chatting with Blake too.

&quot;I swear,&quot; Gabrielle sighed, &quot;that kid can be so irritating when she 
forgets her medication. Yeah! She left them at her house, can you 
believe it? And we all know she can chat up a storm and forget where she 
is once she&#39;s clean.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been known to do the same thing, schatz,&quot; Lilian mentioned 
coyly. Her girlfriend grinned.

&quot;Yeah, but when I do it, it&#39;s cute.&quot; There didn&#39;t seem to be much point 
in chatting, so the gang was largely quiet, waiting for their poky 
friends. It was another ten minutes before they arrived, both of them 
descending the staircase at the same time, most likely a stunt 
coordinated for its effect. Alisha and Usha had to admit, it worked: 
Blake and Olivia were sizzling hot, one wearing a dark blue and the 
other a pure white. Alisha gave a wolf-whistle and wondered briefly if 
she could get away with taking both of them.

&quot;You look outrageous,&quot; she breathed upon seeing Olivia. With her glasses 
absent, her face was free to showcase that beautiful smile of hers, and 
wearing white really brought out the beauty of her dark skin. Usha gave 
her girlfriend a cute little hug from behind, and the whole team posed 
for photos before taking off. Lilian, bless her, had arranged for one of 
the Nachtheim&#39;s personal limos to whisk them all away, and she even 
helped her girlfriend inside. It felt like they were all in a fairy 
tale.

......

Since Miss Marbel really didn&#39;t know the first thing about throwing 
parties, especially for young ladies, she consorted the faculty and 
members of the student body. Together they threw together quite a fancy 
shindig, taking the entire party to a local hotel and booking an entire 
dance room just for the one night. Sonia herself provided the catering, 
and Sarah Jo the music. The theme for this year&#39;s Prom was &quot;It Takes 
All&quot;, an ambiguous term that could mean whatever the guests wanted to 
interpret it as.

Alisha, Blake, Gabrielle, Lilian, Olivia, and Usha arrived ahead of 
schedule, but there were already dozens of students there, dancing and 
congregating and nibbling at the buffet. Nobody quite felt like dancing 
just yet, so the girls flocked to the tables and waited for their 
friends. The room was mostly dim, but flashy lights of all sizes and 
colors gave it a fantastic, fast aura. The music was sufficient, and was 
mixed up to suit all kinds of tastes; the food was significantly better.

&quot;You figure they&#39;ll know where we are?!&quot; shouted Olivia. She nearly had 
to yell in Blake&#39;s ear to be heard.

&quot;Yeah, I hope so! Let&#39;s keep an eye out!&quot; The sextet hovered at the 
table for awhile longer, then the song changed to something up-tempo. 
Gabrielle started twitching, already infected by the dancing bug, and 
took Lilian out on the floor as smooth as silver. The remaining four 
looked at each other and shrugged.

&quot;There&#39;s May and Janine,&quot; Usha indicated. It was hard to see the two 
girls in the flickering darkness, but June Tramble&#39;s presence confirmed 
it. Blake balked.

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe they came here with each other!&quot;

&quot;I find it harder to believe that Vicki got grounded!&quot; Olivia shouted. 
&quot;Imagine the nerve of her parents, keeping her away from this! Honey,&quot; 
she addressed to Alisha, taking her hands, &quot;would you mind waiting a 
bit? I think I&#39;ll dance with June for awhile and keep her company.&quot;

&quot;Sure!&quot; came Fox&#39;s reply. She didn&#39;t really feel like dancing anyway, 
what with her body acting up like that. She watched Olivia walk over, 
and turned around listlessly to the food, scooping up a half-sandwich. 
Then, gesturing to Blake and Usha, &quot;You two go on without me. I&#39;m gonna 
go have a snack.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t get into some trouble later 
on.&quot;

&quot;Good luck!&quot; Usha called out. She and Blake were soon on the floor, 
dancing wildly&#151;sometimes flitting around like fairies, sometimes 
twisting and grinding sensually. The two were not as sexually active as 
they wanted to be, so this dance was a good time to make up for all 
that. They had both been busy; they needed time to unwind and be kids 
again. Kids. Alisha grunted at the thought. She was already eighteen, 
officially an adult. Soon she would have to grow up completely, have 
some responsibilities, get a job&#151;nonsense like that.

&quot;May as well enjoy this night,&quot; she reasoned, clawing at some chips.

Avelina Rohani took one look at the dance floor and beamed.

&quot;Awesome! Let&#39;s dance, Ethe!&quot;

&quot;After you, my princess,&quot; he replied. His leg be damned; Ethan was not 
going to let some silly little handicap ruin his girlfriend&#39;s big night. 
All he had to do was look over and see Olivia and June dancing. They 
both knew what it was like to not have their legs function properly, and 
yet they were having the time of their lives. He owed this at least to 
his girlfriend, and so with a wince, took her and twirled her like a 
top.

&quot;Woo-hoo!&quot; she squealed, whirling around mindlessly. Neither of them 
could dance, but hey, nobody could&#151;not really. Avelina was just glad she 
was there, having fun with her boyfriend, letting all her stress seep 
out in the wild fast movements. It didn&#39;t matter what they did; 
everything was fast and brainless anyway. She bumped into a few people, 
sure, but it was nothing a laugh couldn&#39;t fix.

&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going, you drunk rug-cutters!&quot; squealed Ana Lu as 
they ran into her. She said it jokingly, and gave the two lovebirds a 
hug. &quot;So how you two doing? Everything okay in paradise?&quot;

&quot;So far so good,&quot; came their simultaneous reply. She beamed.

&quot;Cool! Hey, looky here, Rai&#39;s actually in a dress. Who&#39;d a-thunk it?&quot; 
Ethan and Avi waved politely at Rai, who still managed to look manly 
even though she had a pale blue dress, makeup, and a flower in her hair.

&quot;Did you two just get here?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes, the traffic was unimaginable.&quot;

&quot;I know. I wanted to rent a horse and carriage, make everything 
romantic, but...well, that boat passed. I hear somebody actually did 
that.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wow, really? Do you know who?&quot;

&quot;Somebody I don&#39;t know,&quot; she shrugged. &quot;Anyway, I&#39;m glad to see you two 
together. I had a feeling our combined efforts wouldn&#39;t be enough to 
break you two up!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it,&quot; muttered Ethan playfully. He and Avelina both knew 
what Zanders was talking about, and it was all water under the bridge. 
&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; he said, &quot;I heard that Miss Renchina was here 
somewhere. Miss Love told us about it.&quot;

&quot;Is there anything that woman doesn&#39;t know?&quot; muttered Rai. Ana started 
bouncing and dragged her over, impatient little thing, so she politely 
excused herself and attended to her blonde girlfriend. Ethan smiled as 
they left, and looked to his girlfriend, a stunning piece of art dressed 
in gray. Her hair had been styled and was now worn up with pins, making 
her look every bit the Brazilian beauty. He kissed her once and let his 
charming eye linger just a second longer.

&quot;Have I ever told you,&quot; he said, &quot;that you&#39;re lovely?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but it never gets old. Say, look.&quot; She pointed, and he turned 
around. Now even Ethan knew the rumors about Stanton being a school 
largely populated by lesbians, but here at this social gathering, he 
didn&#39;t expect everything to look so...well, heterosexual. There were a 
lot of girls dancing around with male dates.

&quot;I see it. Wonder what that means.&quot; Avelina beamed prettily.

&quot;That these girls are realizing how great you men are!&quot; She leaned up to 
kiss his cheek, and guided him into another dance, this time a slow one.

......

Alisha finally got her chance with Olivia several songs later. The young 
beauty queen came over and offered a quiet apology, and kissed her 
patient girlfriend to make up for it. Alisha shrugged it off, and took 
Olivia to the floor, wary of her limp. Theirs was a strangely odd 
relationship: one slightly promiscuous, the other cautious and wary. 
Only recently had Olivia admitted to and embraced her sexuality, but it 
was more like a dam bursting than a flower blooming: she had already 
engaged in sex with two girls, one of them her close friend, and she 
felt dirty for it. Alisha certainly didn&#39;t judge her, having experienced 
her own fair share of odd episodes&#151;one of them her own sister.

&quot;I have to admit, babe,&quot; she said, folding her arms around Olivia&#39;s bare 
neck, &quot;I&#39;m not feeling too well. I mean, I&#39;m happier now than I&#39;ve been 
in awhile, it&#39;s just...well, it&#39;s physical and chronological stuff.&quot; She 
paused and grimaced&#151;&quot;I&#39;m having my period today.&quot;

&quot;Ugh. You sure you want to stay? We can leave if you want.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s a nice offer, but not just yet,&quot; she managed with a wink. 
&quot;It&#39;d be rude of me to ditch this place early. Besides, I&#39;ve been dying 
to slow-dance with you.&quot; Olivia grinned and held her girlfriend close. 
Unfortunately, the song playing was lightning-fast, and all the guests 
were going all-out to keep up.

&quot;Not for awhile, it seems,&quot; she gestured. Alisha laughed at her 
friends&#151;even Lilian was showing off her moves!&#151;and turned to smooch 
Olivia. Sure, they could wait. It wasn&#39;t like Alisha hadn&#39;t dealt with 
her period before. Besides, being with Olivia made the pain go away a 
little.

Hero and Ayanna tore up the dance floor until a slower song came up, 
then they traveled to the buffet table, dehydrated and out of breath. 
They spied Katt, dressed in gold, parading around quietly with Leena, in 
bronze. A lot of the teachers hung back and chatted with one another, 
but a few were out there with the students, sharing moments of sweet 
harmonious intimacy (the Headmistress was noticeably absent). The two 
self-proclaimed pixies refrained as well, waiting until they caught 
their breath before going back in. They pointed at a few couples, and 
like Ethan and Avelina before them, noticed just how many girls there 
had male dates.

&quot;Must not be the lesbian school we all figured it was,&quot; Ayanna said. 
Hero grinned.

&quot;Or else they could still be in the closet.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m the one with the dirty mind in this relationship. You&#39;re the 
voice of reason.&quot;

&quot;Meh,&quot; she grunted, sticking her tongue out (her lips had clip-on rings, 
making it that much nicer to kiss her). &quot;I can be dirty too. Of course, 
I don&#39;t mind getting clean in the process.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. You&#39;ll be showering alone all summer if you keep that up.&quot;

&quot;No fair,&quot; she whined. Ayanna laughed and drew her girlfriend close, 
staring deep into her eyes. They twisted and revolved, dancing a little 
right there, not caring if anybody saw them. Kathlyn Parkin, out there 
with Leena, clung onto the older woman tenderly, remembering the time 
they had danced naked together under the moonlight. Wearing such 
beautiful costumes made it just as erotic; being around all those 
people, now openly public about their relationship, made it special. It 
was their night; they both deserved it. And Marbel had told Kathlyn she 
could stay out as long as she wanted, provided she be back at her home 
&quot;sometime around dinner&quot; the next day. That certainly left her quite a 
window of opportunity with Leena...

Meanwhile, Avelina and Ethan found their benefactor, Carlisle &quot;the 
Wrench&quot; Renchina, and stopped her to thank her for her small role in 
keeping them together. It was nothing, she said&#151;anything for cute kids 
like them. She then introduced them to her date, an ecstatic (and 
perhaps high) Alexis Walker, who had paid for the whole evening as a way 
of settling her debt with the Wrench.

&quot;Normally I don&#39;t do girls,&quot; said Carly to the young couple, &quot;but when 
one of them&#39;s in your debt, what can ya do? I just wish some guy owed me 
some money&#151;then I&#39;d be really happy!&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; whined X, &quot;I&#39;m not that bad, am I?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not even remotely gay, Walker,&quot; Carly told her. &quot;I know it&#39;s hard 
to accept, but please get that through your thick skull. Nikholai, 
Rohani,&quot; she nodded, &quot;a pleasure seeing you.&quot; She winked and waved 
farewell, leaving the two grinning. They continued slow-dancing until 
the song ended, then decided to check up on the third member of their 
party. It came as no surprise to see poor Vai just standing there like 
the wallflower she was, her hands folded and her face marred with 
boredom.

&quot;Poor girl,&quot; Avelina crooned. &quot;It sucks that she wasn&#39;t able to get a 
date. Ethan, be a dear and dance with her. I don&#39;t want her going all 
night without someone to dance with.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot; he said, ribbing her. She blanched.

&quot;Um...well, I&#39;m saving it for later! You slow-dance with her, and I get 
the fun stuff. That&#39;s more your department anyway, so get to it!&quot; He 
smiled sweetly and bowed.

&quot;Anything for you, fairest princess.&quot; He turned around and walked over 
to poor Vai, who didn&#39;t look like she was enjoying herself. She had 
wanted to come, certainly, but having no date meant that she went by 
herself. Not wanting her first real female friend to be so lonely, 
Avelina invited Vai to come with her and Ethan&#151;a sweet gesture, but 
unless one of them went over and brought her onto the floor, she would 
be better off staying at home.

&quot;Hello, Vai,&quot; Ethan greeted her, bowing politely. She grinned bashfully 
and let the nice guy kiss her hand. Now if only this boy had a brother, 
a cousin, a long-lost twin or something! He asked her to dance&#151;she 
accepted, naturally&#151;and Avelina watched them with glee. She wasn&#39;t 
jealous at all; the woman was just a well of loving kindness, waiting 
for someone to dip in and drink. Their turn on the floor ended after 
about five minutes&#151;a long dance! Avelina then cut in politely, took her 
friend&#39;s hand, and twirled with her wildly when the tempo of the dance 
music picked up.

It was definitely one of the few happy moments Vai had as of late.

......

&quot;Some party, huh?&quot; said Janine to May as they backed off and watched the 
others dance. They were only in it for the fast songs&#151;no slow-dancing 
for them that night, not yet at least. Earlier, the two girls had 
tentatively agreed to be each other&#39;s dates, but only because neither 
one had any boyfriends lined up around the corner. They also agreed not 
to tell anyone they were going as dates: it would only add fuel to the 
fire. So far, they were having fun, and treated each other more like 
friends than real actual dates, but the night was young and the sensual 
energy in the room was just starting to rise.

&quot;Right&#151;some party. Whew! I&#39;m hot!&quot;

&quot;Hey, show some modesty,&quot; Janine muttered playfully. May chuckled and 
nudged her.

&quot;You know what I meant! ...Boy, what a night. I&#39;m already worn out. It&#39;s 
sort of sad that June doesn&#39;t have a date.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; said Janine, eyeing her friend&#39;s twin sister. &quot;But she doesn&#39;t 
seem to mind. There&#39;s not much a girl in a wheelchair can do at Prom, 
except sit back and socialize. Hey...&quot; Her voice lowered, indicating she 
had something serious on her mind. May leaned in to hear: &quot;Do you really 
think she&#39;s going to walk again one day?&quot;

&quot;Of course. She&#39;s really started to pick up. That buddy of yours, 
Grissom, is like a pair of crutches to her. At first, when June told me 
she was gay, I was totally surprised. I mean, this is my twin sister; we 
hardly kept any secrets. But after everything that&#39;s happened, I&#39;m glad 
she&#39;s happy. This whole thing has really put a boost on her outlook&#151;and 
mine.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Janine couldn&#39;t help but blush a little. &quot;So...wait&#151;you&#39;re not gay 
too, are you?&quot;

&quot;No comment,&quot; May stated. Bautista chuckled and slapped her friend&#39;s 
back.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not a no! So why aren&#39;t you out there keeping your little 
sister company?&quot;

&quot;Because she&#39;s perfectly capable of finding her own company,&quot; May stated 
quietly, and it was true. June went up to several other wallflowers and 
managed to have a few moments with them. She even went up to Vai, who 
didn&#39;t have the heart to decline an offer from a handicapped girl.

&quot;Poor stupid Vicki,&quot; sighed Janine. &quot;It&#39;s her own lousy fault she got 
grounded. She&#39;s missing out on such a good time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah... Hey.&quot; May ribbed her friend and pointed. Off in the distance, 
Janine could see Mira van Dijk and her &quot;non-date&quot; Rozalia Miklos walk 
off for a private moment together. Her eyebrows rose.

&quot;Oh. Looks like we&#39;re not the only ambiguous couple here. You really 
think they&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to comment on that,&quot; May said. She finished her drink and 
took Janine by the hand, asking her to dance. The two became a little 
flustered when they actually went on the floor and put their arms around 
each other; it was a slow dance.

......

One thought was shared between the two girls as they sought privacy: 
neither one could believe that Miklos actually agreed to go to the Prom 
with Mira. Of course, they plastered the whole thing with a big 
&quot;Non-date&quot; sticker, feebly justifying their time spent together. Mira 
was giddy with excitement; Rozalia carried a chip of uncertainty on her 
shoulder. She wanted to go to Prom, this was true, and her day spent at 
the convention proved that Mira wasn&#39;t a complete pill, but something 
about all this still racked her nerves. Mira had been nice to her so 
far, dancing only when Rozy asked to, hanging back when she wanted to 
stop. And now Miklos had her by the hand, guiding her away from the 
noise and the populous, out into the warm mid-May evening.

And then, time slowed down. They stood for awhile outside, admiring the 
muffled sounds of slow music and the quiet stars above. As they stood 
there, Mira wanting her new friend to make the first move, Miss Miklos 
remained silent until she felt comfortable talking. The fact that Mira 
had once been a bully to her, and was now infatuated with her, didn&#39;t 
quite escape her system even as the throbbing serenity of the evening 
drifted on.

&quot;Mira,&quot; Rozy spoke up, &quot;I guess I&#39;m glad I came here with you. I 
mean...uh, do you think I&#39;ve been a jerk? Because sometimes I get the 
feeling that I&#39;ve been nothing but a pain in the butt.&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;ve been pleasant,&quot; Mira replied warmly. &quot;I like you. I like us 
as friends. We are friends, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; came the lame reply. She looked over at the redheaded Dutch 
and forced out a grin. &quot;Friends, huh? So you&#39;ve abandoned the whole love 
thing?&quot;

&quot;Well, I still have a big crush on you. But I think it would be better 
to be your friend first. If you really aren&#39;t comfortable with all this, 
then I won&#39;t go any further. I guess I&#39;ll be happy no matter what, as 
long as I&#39;m with you.&quot; Rozalia couldn&#39;t help but turn red, and faltered 
considerably. Okay...take it easy, girl. Just because nobody has ever 
said that to you, that doesn&#39;t mean anything. I mean, Mira&#39;s a nice 
girl, right? ...When she&#39;s not teasing me or being weird, sure. Well, 
she&#39;s not even all that bad when she&#39;s being weird, and she has stopped 
making fun of you. She wants to be your friend. What if she weren&#39;t gay? 
Would you still want to be her friend?

Rozalia knew the answer. Of course she would.

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; she replied at last. Then, she took a big breath, 
suddenly deciding to test the boundaries of this new relationship. 
&quot;Hey...Mira? Can I trust you with a secret?&quot;

&quot;Sure, sure. I am very loyal when it comes to secrets.&quot;

&quot;All right. I&#39;m really not supposed to tell this to anyone, but...well, 
you won&#39;t tell, will you?&quot;

&quot;No, of course not. ...Wait, are you going to come out?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s nothing like that,&quot; stated the young blonde. &quot;I...look, this 
is really deep, so please, you can&#39;t tell anyone.&quot; Mira swore she 
wouldn&#39;t, on her own life, so Rozy drew a deep breath and let her little 
clandestine piece come out of hiding.

&quot;...My real name is Kimberly Green,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Rozalia is just 
a name I was given to protect my identity. This is something I only told 
my teachers; they&#39;re the only ones who are allowed to know. I&#39;m part of 
the witness protection program, which is why I had to change my name. A 
little while before I transferred, I met up with someone who I thought I 
could trust, a friend I met online. ...He wasn&#39;t exactly prince 
charming,&quot; she muttered darkly. &quot;I was almost raped, but I escaped 
unharmed. When I told my parents and the Feds...well, my mother and 
father blew a fuse. They disowned me right in front of the FBI and threw 
me out of the house.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Rozy,&quot; Mira whispered, completely stricken by this unbelievable 
tale. &quot;I...I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be; that place was stupid anyway. My parents were total 
perfectionist control freaks; it was like living in a cage. Anyway, the 
Feds moved me in with my uncle, Garver Miklos, which is where I get my 
new surname. I had to alter everything about me. You wouldn&#39;t believe me 
if I told you, but once I wore skirts and had longer hair. I have no 
idea if or when I&#39;m supposed to testify against this guy&#151;I guess when 
they catch him&#151;so until then, I&#39;m just walking on eggshells and trying 
to fit in with this new place. Pretty weird, no?&quot; Mira gave Rozy a sad 
look, and wanted nothing more than to cuddle the girl in her arms, where 
she&#39;d be safe.

&quot;I...didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Rozy said cheerfully; &quot;how could you? It&#39;s a secret 
now, so don&#39;t go telling anyone, all right? Just keep calling me Rozy 
and everything will be all right.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I can do that,&quot; Mira said, stepping closer. &quot;Kimmy is such 
a cute name. It suits you.&quot; Rozy&#151;Kimberly Green&#151;turned red and looked 
away shyly. That was definitely something nobody had ever said to her 
before.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You can call me that if you want, but only in 
private, okay?&quot; Mira nodded and promised she would, then drew any closer 
and slowly, carefully, took Rozy&#39;s hand.

&quot;Your secret is safe with me...Kimmy.&quot; Rozalia smiled gently, and 
squeezed Mira&#39;s hand back.

.........

Even though Prom wasn&#39;t officially over until everyone left the hotel, 
some groups and couples left early, either because they were tired or 
because they wanted to...acquaint themselves with their loved ones in a 
more secluded environment. And hey, the whole thing took place right in 
a hotel, so what could be more convenient? A lot of people had booked 
rooms, and one by one, they retired to these rooms, whether to nobly 
sleep the night away or to engage in sexual activity. Alisha and her 
&quot;group&quot; all shared one big room, the couples each bunking in one of the 
three beds. This made it understandably difficult to &quot;explore&quot; one 
another, but somehow, Blake and Usha managed.

&quot;Sex fiends,&quot; mumbled Olivia, who could hear their muffled cries and 
moans. Luckily, not all the beds were in the same area; some were at 
least closed off by doors. She turned to her date, who only wore a 
T-shirt and panties, and donned a gleam of wanting. &quot;Not that there&#39;s 
anything wrong with it. You wanna...&quot;

&quot;Honestly, yes,&quot; Alisha said. Olivia laughed and effortlessly undressed 
her girlfriend. All the pain Alisha Fox had felt earlier that evening 
quickly fled away as she melded her fair skin with Olivia&#39;s sweet silky 
body, and the two writhed in the joys of blissful lovemaking for quite 
some time. Gabrielle, for the record, fell asleep almost instantly, 
Lilian cuddled close by.

Hero and Ayanna elected to see each other home. After all, they had 
already experienced enough, and didn&#39;t want to ruin the evening by 
tempting each other.

Avelina, Ethan, and Vai all shared one small room in the hotel, with Vai 
on the couch. She wasn&#39;t lonely, though; she had television privileges 
for as long as she wished.

Rai stayed over at Ana&#39;s house. Alexis and Carly, who were roommates 
anyway, were content to go home, and for the first time in her life, the 
Wrench understood what it was like to make love to another woman. &quot;Not 
bad,&quot; she declared when all was said and done, &quot;but I&#39;ve had better.&quot; 
Alexis just poked her and curled up beside the older woman.

Kathlyn and Leena...took Bernadette Marbel on her offer. What else 
needed to be said?

Mira and Rozy shared a room, stayed up all night watching a 24-hour 
anime network, and went their separate ways in the morning. Mira wanted 
to kiss her new friend, but even she knew that Rozy&#151;Kimmy to her&#151;was not 
ready yet. A simple squeeze of the hand sufficed.

As for May and Janine...well...

......

&quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s over,&quot; sighed the younger girl, plopping down on the 
bed. Between the two of them, they had just enough money to afford a 
single-bed room for one night. Having already undressed, they were now 
ready to settle in for the evening, though technically it was already 
the next day. May gave her friend a smile of agreement and plodded over 
to dig herself underneath the covers.

&quot;Yeah, tell me about it&#151;oof, I&#39;m sore.&quot; She winced and complained about 
how all danced-out she was...and then, a comfortable silence fell over 
both of them. There was nothing in that moment except the warmth of 
their bodies, the sweet silent intimacy, and a mixture of weariness and 
satisfaction. Prom hadn&#39;t been the big romantic extravaganza TV and 
movies made it out to be, but it certainly had been worth going. After 
laying there on the bed for awhile, Janine rolled over and looked at her 
friend.

&quot;So, May...ready for graduation and the finals?&quot;

&quot;Smalltalk,&quot; she muttered, making it sound like a curse. Janine laughed. 
&quot;Um...about as ready as a girl my age can be. What&#39;s on your mind?&quot; 
Janine&#39;s smile turned shy, her eyes gleaming with secrets.

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want to know what&#39;s on my mind.&quot;

&quot;Yeah I do, tell me.&quot;

&quot;No...it&#39;s inappropriate.&quot;

&quot;Now you have to tell me.&quot; Janine grinned; the two were now facing each 
other, one eager and the other unsure.

&quot;Well...it&#39;s...this,&quot; she said, leaning over to press her lips on May&#39;s 
mouth. She kept them there, softly quivering, long enough to prove her 
point. When she withdrew, May&#39;s face looked clear and focused, maybe a 
little startled.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she said. This was going to take some processing. Janine touched 
her face tenderly, caressing the soft skin beneath the blanket of 
darkness.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; answered May, smiling. &quot;I just...didn&#39;t think...after what 
we discussed, you&#39;d... I mean, are you scared?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m petrified,&quot; came the honest answer. Now she put both her hands on 
May&#39;s face, and added with a sparkly smile, &quot;but I&#39;m excited as well. 
May, I don&#39;t want to pretend anymore; I don&#39;t want to make all this an 
act. I want to be real. I want to...be like this.&quot; She kissed her again; 
this time the older woman reciprocated, taking Janine&#39;s hair into her 
fingers and clasping softly. Their tongues instinctively protruded out 
for a moment before flicking against one another shyly, and the embrace 
slowed.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you afraid of losing your identity?&quot;

&quot;My identity sucks. I hate being this cowardly person. I hate denying 
the fact that I&#39;m enjoying every minute of this. I hate how this tension 
drives us apart and draws us together again. I need a new identity, I 
need to start over. I don&#39;t know if this means I&#39;m really a lesbian or 
not&#151;I just want...to be with you.&quot;

&quot;That is so corny,&quot; chuckled May. Janine pinched her gently.

&quot;Hey, gimme a break, it&#39;s not like this was rehearsed! Besides, I&#39;m 
pouring my heart out to you. The least you could do is listen.&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m sorry sweetie.&quot; May smiled and kissed Janine&#39;s eyebrows, then 
her cheeks, and her nose. They gazed at each other when she was low 
enough to kiss those honeysuckle lips...and drew together as one, 
neither afraid nor shy.

They sat up on the bed together, hardly daring to part from one another 
as they explored this new, yet familiar intimacy. Their legs came 
wrapping around their waists, arms holding the other woman tight, so 
tight that their pulses became synchronized. Now they no longer had fear 
or uncertainty, even when they paused just to look at each other, to 
smile, to caress the beautiful face before them. May lowered her head to 
start pecking at Janine&#39;s neck, an area she had never touched before; 
Bautista started to see little spots every time those flowery petals 
tickled her skin. The sensation of fingers fumbling for cloth came to 
her as May&#39;s hands dug underneath her shirt, and subtly started to pull 
on it.

Janine raised her arms without needing any more instruction. She felt a 
rush of sexuality, adrenaline, and white cotton as May lifted her shirt 
off and discarded it, leaving her sitting in her blue panties. They 
looked at each other, hearts racing, understandably unsure about this 
path they were treading. Without hesitation, Janine took May&#39;s hands and 
kissed them delicately. She trailed up the woman&#39;s arms to her 
shoulders, then her neck, finally stopping to suckle the girl&#39;s cute, 
generous earlobe.

&quot;You too,&quot; she whispered huskily. May lifted her arms slowly, and within 
a moment their chests were bare, naked nipples smiling at one another in 
greeting. The two ceased their activity just to stare at the new beauty 
before them, and dove in carelessly to cuddle, mold, embrace, caress, 
and pinch their bare bosoms. Janine had May pinned down on the bed after 
endless ages drawled by, meshing their underwear and their breasts 
together in the first stages of carnal, saccharine love.

She pulled down on May&#39;s underwear and exposed the woman for every 
honest area she had. May did the same. And after that...oh!
