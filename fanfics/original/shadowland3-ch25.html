<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 25 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>Sophia led the group of new arrivals down the front steps of the train 
station, wanting to get back to the academy posthaste. She did not know 
what was coming, but the cloud overhead gave her a disconcerting feeling 
and she needed to make sure all was well with her girls. If her sister, 
Melissa, was at full health she would not have a care in the world, but 
with both of them at half strength she had a cause for worry and the 
increasing size of those thunderclouds overhead was starting to make her 
think that they maybe in for one hell of a night if she did not return 
to the school soon. 

Her uneasy over the weather caused her to fumble with her keys, dropping 
them back into her pocket several times and finally fishing them out 
only to fumble with them as she tried to find the right one, her car 
seeming to be kilometres away.

Jessica watched the woman as she sifted through the many keys upon the 
key chain, her eyes always at the skies overhead, &quot;Is something wrong, 
Head Mistress?&quot; She inquired worriedly, finding her own eyes searching 
the dark skies for what the teacher could be anxious about. 

Sophia&#39;s eyes dropped back to her keys as she found the one to her car, 
&quot;Its nothing.&quot; She glanced over her shoulder to find the three new 
arrivals were right behind her. Suddenly her eyes spotted movement above 
the train station and she squinted at it to get a better view when she 
spotted an enormous set of shimmering wings spread out on the roof of 
the building. Not the wings of a Sister of Death, even from this 
distance she knew that those wings were not made of feather, flesh and 
blood, no these wings were made of fragments of stained glass and that 
only meant one thing. 

&quot;Run!!&quot; She cried out to the girls and handed her keys to Jessica, 
&quot;Jessica, unlock the door and get everyone inside.&quot; She urgently 
commanded. 

Jessica stared at the keys in confusion, &quot;Why? What&#39;s going on...?&quot; She 
followed Sophia&#39;s gaze to see glass wings spread out atop of the train 
station and suddenly take flight, &quot;Carey...&quot; She breathed and quickly 
turned on her heels as she did as the Head Mistress had ordered. 

Carey flew high upon the storm&#39;s winds and suddenly dove at the Head 
Mistress.  Sophia brought up her hands and spread out her fingers, 
&quot;Leave here Carey. These girls are not yours!&quot; She called out over the 
increasing winds that began to howl about her head, causing her hair to 
whip about ferociously. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Amber inquired frightenly, taking a glimpse over her 
shoulder to see a small child of no more then twelve or thirteen years 
gliding upon the winds to land atop of a street lamp and perch atop it, 
&quot;That girl is flying!!&quot; She exclaimed in shock at what she was seeing. 

&quot;No time to explain.&quot; Jessica said as she struggled to get the key into 
the lock, cursing her trembling hands. &quot;Lets just say she is not here to 
welcome us.&quot;

A sinister grin crossed Carey&#39;s face from her perch, &quot;Who said I was 
after those girls?&quot; She inquired of the Head Mistress, her wings turned 
so their sharp feathers pointed towards Sophia, &quot;Maybe it is you I 
want?&quot; Suddenly the several feathers broke free from their place over 
the girl&#39;s shoulders and flew at the woman. 

Sophia waved her hand and the feathers exploded into tiny fragments that 
twinkled to the asphalt parking lot, glistening in the light of the 
streetlights, &quot;Stop it Carey!&quot; Sophia demanded.

&quot;Shit!!&quot; Sarah cursed as she watched the display before her, &quot;What kind 
of world have we walked into?&quot; She inquired, wrapping an arm 
protectively around Caitlin as the girl sobbed softly. 

Jessica turned the key in the lock and smiled gratefully as she watched 
the bolt pop up and she quickly opened the door, &quot;Get in everyone.&quot; She 
commanded, jumping into the car and reaching around to pull the lock on 
the back door. 

Amber quickly opened the door and crawled into the car, &quot;What about that 
lady?&quot; She inquired nervously.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Sarah agreed as she helped Caitlin into the car, &quot;Who&#39;s going to 
drive this thing?&quot; 

Jessica put the key into the ignition and turned it, &quot;I can drive.&quot; She 
stated confidently. 

Sarah slid into the car next to Caitlin, their bags cramped upon their 
legs, &quot;Do you have a licence?&quot; 

Jessica shook her head, &quot;Nope.&quot; She glanced around to peer into the rear 
view mirror to see how the Head Mistress was doing. Last time Jessica 
had encountered Carey it took all of Kris&#39;s strength to take the girl 
down. This time it appeared that Sophia would not be so lucky and 
Jessica prayed that she was wrong. 

Sophia glared up at the death angel overhead, &quot;What would you want me 
for?&quot; She inquired, glancing over her shoulder to see the girls were 
safely in the car, but unsure how she was going to distract Carey long 
enough to get to the car herself. 

&quot;You should pay more attention to me and less to them.&quot; Carey shouted 
angrily, &quot;I am your opponent here.&quot; She spread her arms wide and 
hundreds of feathers responded to her gesture, flying in every direction 
and circling around towards the Head Mistress. 


Sophia quickly glanced around at the many gleaming blades of colourful 
glass as they came spirally towards her. Abruptly she leapt into the 
air, several shards colliding into each other, shattering upon impact. 
Her feet touched the ground again and she felt pain race through her 
knees, causing her to stagger ever so slightly and lean heavily upon her 
cane. She struggled to get her legs to respond only it was too late and 
a chunk of glass struck her in the shoulder with enough force to rip its 
way out the other side, leaving a gapping wound and splashing blood to 
the ground. 

Jessica jumped up from her place at the driver&#39;s seat, &quot;SOPHIA!!!&quot; She 
cried out as she watched the woman stagger to the ground and struggle to 
get to her feet again. 

&quot;GET OUT OF HERE!!!&quot; Sophia demanded, waving for the girl to move, &quot;Go 
on, Ge--&quot; Her word were cut short as three more shards stabbed her in 
the chest and she slummed to the ground on all fours, panting for 
breathe. 

Carey laughed manically, &quot;Not so tough now are you?&quot; She stated 
gleefully, &quot;Once you are gone I will take the souls of ever last one of 
her precious students. 

Sophia&#39;s head snapped up and she glared at the Angel, &quot;You... will... 
do...&quot; She struggled to her feet, resting heavily upon her cane as she 
rose, &quot;no... such thing.&quot; She snarled at the girl. 

Carey was taken back by the Head Mistress&#39;s strength, &quot;What can you do? 
You&#39;re near your own death bed.&quot; 

&quot;Jessie?&quot; She called out to the girl. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Jessica took a step closer to the woman. 

&quot;Tell my sister I love her.&quot; Sophia said with that warming smile that 
she had so frequently gave the girl&#39;s over the years. Quickly she turned 
and charged at the lamppost on which the Stained Glass Angel perched and 
hit it with all her strength, causing the metal post to bend and the 
girl to fall from her seat. 

&quot;Hey!!!&quot; Carey cried out, her wings not able to catch flight for having 
not formed again since her assault, causing her to be at the will of 
gravity itself. Her hands slipped from their grip on the light and she 
feel to the ground with a heavy thud, right next to the Head Mistress 
who turned and grinned down at the girl, not a warm loving smile, no 
this was the grin of someone who had just won the game. 

&quot;What did you say you were going to do to my girls?&quot; The Head Mistress 
inquired as she stepped over the girl and grabbed her by the throat. 

Carey clawed at the woman&#39;s arm in vain, &quot;Let me go you witch.&quot; 

&quot;Never.&quot; Sophia declared as electricity started to leap out of the 
ground at her feet and around her legs, &quot;You will never harm my children 
again.&quot; She stated as the blue energy bolts enveloped her and the girl, 
&quot;I&#39;m going to make sure of that.&quot; She assured the girl, a maniacal grin 
upon her face. 

Carey struggled against the woman&#39;s grasp only to have Sophia wrap her 
other arm around the girl and hold her tight, &quot;Let me go!&quot; Carey 
screamed out in distress, &quot;I&#39;ll kill you. I&#39;ll KILLL YOUUUU!!!&quot; Several 
shards of glass began to twitch from their place on the ground and began 
to slide towards the girl. 

Sophia glanced around herself to see an increasing number of glass 
fragments had encircled her, &quot;You are not getting away from me.&quot; She 
snarled at the girl. Abruptly several shards leapt to life and stabbed 
the woman in the back just as the blue energy completely encircled them 
and there was a huge flash of white light. 

Jessica, blinded against the light, rubbed at her eyes in a vain attempt 
to rid herself of the white spots that appeared. When the spots began to 
subside she found Sophia and Carey were nowhere in sight. 

Sarah was watching the scene with her head stuck out the window and 
shook her head in disbelief, &quot;What the hell just happened? Are they 
dead?&quot; 

&quot;I hope not...&quot; Jessica slowly sat in the driver seat again and set her 
head heavily upon the steering wheel. 

Amber reached out and touched the girl upon the shoulder causing her to 
turn around in her seat and look upon the girl&#39;s she once called her 
sister. Amber gave the girl a weak smile and Jessica returned it. 
Knowing full well that couldn&#39;t just sit around at the train station 
Jessica pulled the door shut, put the car in reverse and started out of 
the parking lot on their way back to the school.
