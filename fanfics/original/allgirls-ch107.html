<h1>All Girls School (part 107 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch106.html">Back to Part 106</a><pre>There comes a time in one&#39;s life where they face a great turning point. 
Usually it&#39;s whenever they come of age, or when they retire, or perhaps 
during a wedding or a funeral. But sometimes, this change can just 
occur, right out of the blue, and how you handle it shapes your entire 
future from then on out. It&#39;s the inevitability that we all look forward 
to and we all avoid, the absolution that all of us hate and all of us 
love.

I myself have had many turning points in my life, most of them not 
recorded in these tales of mine. I can remember this one event 
especially well: it came by without an alarm, without a warning, and 
forced me to change my entire outlook on things in the matter of a few 
minutes. I know, it sucks, but you have to be prepared for changes like 
this. In my profession, you can&#39;t get too comfortable, or something bad 
might happen.

Or worse yet, something good might happen, but you&#39;re so occupied with 
other things, you&#39;re too blind to notice it. And once this good thing is 
gone, you may never get another chance like it. But like I said, you 
have to prepare for these things, good or bad. Keep your eyes and ears 
open, try not to forget anything, and always remember that you need to 
sleep and eat just like everyone else.

Bernadette Marbel&#39;s last lesson was short, quick, and very private.

&quot;Remember, young ladies, no one is an island.&quot;

Well, here goes nothing.

&quot;The Ode to Finals&quot;

It was now down to the week of finals, where the loyal students would 
run one last gauntlet before being released into the outside 
world&#151;whether temporarily or for good. Those taking these finals for the 
last time felt a great sense of freedom come over them; those who had 
studied and knew the material smiled with relief, recognizing problems 
here and there, and quickly formulated solutions. Those who had merely 
sat there absorbing it all took the strain wearily, oftentimes pausing 
to ponder how well (or unwell) they would do. A few muttered prayers.

&quot;It&#39;s just like the saying goes,&quot; muttered Miss Keeping to herself as 
she watched her students scribble. &quot;As long as there are tests, there 
will be prayer in schools.&quot; Neither she nor her fianc&eacute; believed in 
taking tests in silence, so they had both brought their little CD 
players and an arrangement of classical music to accompany the girls. It 
soothed them a little and gave them something to drift off to when they 
were lost or finished. Abby spent her time grading papers at the last 
minute, but she was also drawing up plans for her summer vacation.

She and Hitomi had set their wedding date circa the New Year, but they 
were both open to even later times. Right now they didn&#39;t feel they 
needed to rush&#151;and actually, Abigail did think her proposal had been a 
little sudden. After all, they had not been genuine lovers for that 
long, and even though every moment she spent with her &quot;Tomi-chan&quot; was a 
dream come true, she wondered if asking for the woman&#39;s hand in marriage 
so soon was a mistake. Well, no use thinking about it now; they were in 
it for the long haul. They actually decided to wait until after summer 
vacation was over before announcing it to their friends and 
coworkers...but there was also the issue of Hitomi&#39;s parents.

Abby sighed as she thought about them. Her lover hadn&#39;t even spoken to 
them since they disowned her six years earlier. As badly as they had 
treated her, she still wanted to meet them and have them at the wedding. 
Her own parents were in Romania, vaguely involved in some company she 
didn&#39;t know about, and probably wouldn&#39;t be able to make it even if it 
was their only child tying the knot. Ah, mother and father...Abby smiled 
warmly as her thoughts drifted. She never came completely out to them 
(and even to this day referred to herself as a bisexual), but from what 
little she did reveal, they didn&#39;t seem concerned.

&quot;I just wish,&quot; she murmured, &quot;Hitomi had grown up in a home like mine. 
But if that happened, she&#39;d probably be a spoiled brat like me and not 
the tigress I know and love.&quot; She then chuckled&#151;tigress. Hitomi had 
given her an extra special treat for that compliment.

&quot;Miss Keeping?&quot; called Usha about forty-five minutes into the test. &quot;If 
we finish early, may we recreate quietly?&quot;

&quot;Oh, of course. And if everybody gets done ahead of schedule, you can 
chat to your heart&#39;s content. I mean, this is technically the last time 
I&#39;m going to see this class, so you may as well have some fun. No 
pressure, of course.&quot; Usha smiled and began scribbling notes. Ah, test 
days: a marvelous excuse for students to shut up and teachers to just 
sit back and daydream.

......

Sonia hadn&#39;t been teaching and cooking at Stanton as long as her lover, 
but even she knew that the last few days before winter and summer 
vacations were wild cards when it came to culinary delights. The 
students either loaded up, bought fast food, or brought lunch from home 
so they could eat while testing. Sonia was required to make something 
for them, even if nobody bought anything, so she set to work with the 
other kitchen staff like it was any other day.

&quot;Hey, Chef Vee!&quot; Sonia grinned warmly and stuck her head out to the main 
serving window, spotting a group of students waving at her. Sonia 
already had a small fan club, mostly consisting of girls who looked up 
to her as a role model. She was very tall for a woman, but humble; 
successful, yet sweet and earthy; gorgeous, but very shy, and above all, 
completely open and honest about herself.

&quot;Be with you in a second!&quot; she called. She darted back to her staff&#151;they 
knew how popular she was, and besides, the whole kitchen wouldn&#39;t 
collapse if she left to chat for a few minutes&#151;and rushed back out to 
the students, giving them a precious smile. &quot;Well, hello ladies. How are 
finals?&quot;

&quot;Ugh, terrible. I totally bombed history.&quot;

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t there be laws against that level of difficulty?&quot;

&quot;Miss Cerio is sooooo cruel.&quot;

&quot;And yet sooooo hot.&quot; Giggles abounded; even Sonia laughed.

&quot;I think she&#39;s just trying to prove that a gorgeous blonde bombshell can 
also be an intelligent woman.&quot;

&quot;If that&#39;s so, then she could sure tone it down. Hey, Vee, you hear any 
rumors about her latest girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Ladies, I don&#39;t spread rumors,&quot; replied the tall woman. &quot;As far as I 
know, Miss Cerio seems quite content to be single.&quot;

&quot;I hear that she and Miss Raulson are dating again.&quot;

&quot;Ohmygosh! What if they hook up for real this time? That would be soooo 
cute!&quot;

&quot;No way, it&#39;s Cero and Doc Andrews for life. They&#39;re like the perfect 
couple.&quot;

&quot;Not as perfect as Chef Vee and Miss Post,&quot; pointed another girl. The 
others let out a fluttery aww, batting their eyelashes at Miss Verela. 
Sonia blushed timidly and asked her fans to not say such embarrassing 
things.

&quot;But you are dating her, right?&quot;

&quot;Well, of course. We love each other so much.&quot;

&quot;Awww!&quot;

&quot;So are you doing anything over summer vacation?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m visiting my family in South America.&quot;

&quot;Are you gonna take Miss Post with you?&quot; Sonia turned an even darker 
shade of red. Have her dear sweet Elly ride on a plane with her to a 
beautiful location so she could meet her parents? And then spend the 
whole summer there, parading around like kids? It was almost too much to 
hope for.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;that depends on whether or not she has plans. I would 
certainly like to.&quot;

&quot;Awww!&quot;

&quot;You see?&quot; came a familiar catty voice from behind. &quot;This is why 
everyone thinks you two are so disgusting. The sugary sweetness is just 
overwhelming.&quot; Sonia rolled her eyes and turned around, smiling down at 
the diminutive Em McGowen. The bizarre science teacher might&#39;ve been on 
the petite side, but she was crazy enough to stare down the likes of 
Sonia, who was gentle as a lamb.

&quot;Emma, don&#39;t you have a class to teach?&quot;

&quot;Well, yeah, but the finals do it for me. I just snuck out to grab a 
snack.&quot; Sonia sighed, smiled, and went inside the kitchen to see what 
she could cook up. Once she was gone, Emma snickered and gathered the 
other girls around her, determined to soak up as much last-minute gossip 
as she could.

......

Andeira Torvald smiled as the last of her students filed out of her 
class, onto the next. And to think, she had actually thought about 
leaving these precious ones! Looking back, though her decision to stay 
hadn&#39;t been that long ago, she wondered how on Earth she could be so 
selfish or cowardly. Her coworkers were right: these girls needed her, 
not just as a teacher but a mentor and confidante as well. Even when 
people like Mihoshi or Kula graduated, there would always be another 
troubled girl out there, always another soul floundering away, reaching 
out for a savior. If Andeira left, then who would reach out to them? Who 
would cross barriers as only she could, and heal their scars?

In the end, she was glad she had stayed, and so was everyone else. Even 
Dr. Andrews gave her a kind smile, and for a moment Torvald actually 
believed the woman had a shard of warmth in her after all. Later, 
Andrews made a clear pass at her, mentioning how glad she was that 
&quot;Andy&quot; would continue to grace the school with her natural beauty and 
charm. Torvald politely shoved the doctor&#39;s hand off her shoulder and 
walked away, leaving her to stare. Oh, yes. Today&#39;s prey was tomorrow&#39;s 
play.

&quot;Enjoy your vacation, Andy,&quot; Jean swore seductively as she watched the 
older woman turn a corner. &quot;When you get back, you and I have some 
catching-up to do.&quot;

&quot;Can I come in?&quot; Janna looked up and noticed that Abi, her 
once-and-present girlfriend, was standing at the door, completely cool 
as always. She smiled and waved her inside, professing how ungodly she 
felt being swamped underneath all these finals. Abi sighed and traced 
her hair from her forehead, perching herself on Janna&#39;s desk.

&quot;My students all hated me this year,&quot; she said. &quot;Such spoiled girls. I 
don&#39;t think I gave them anything they couldn&#39;t handle. Isn&#39;t it sad, 
Jan, that in this day and age, a kid&#39;s not expected to push herself to 
her best? That the public school can just shove any mediocre girl out 
the door and tell her good luck? I swear, the old days are long gone. I 
remember when people had to work to be successful.&quot; Janna laughed 
politely, and drew Abi&#39;s hand in for a comforting kiss.

&quot;And therefore, they hate us for harkening back to those glory days,&quot; 
she added. &quot;Dear me, what&#39;s this world come to? You know, it&#39;s not just 
us who expect the most out of their students. Em and Hitomi work them 
like taskmasters, but the girls seem to love them. Sarah and Abby have 
their own methods of pushing them, and yet they&#39;re well-respected. What 
makes us so different?&quot;

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Abi relented. &quot;Can&#39;t be our charm. We&#39;ve got more than most 
people in here. And it can&#39;t be our good looks&#151;why, you&#39;re even prettier 
than I am!&quot; Janna blushed and whispered a thanks. She knew this wasn&#39;t 
true; she just wanted to humor her girlfriend. Abi took Janna&#39;s hand 
into her own and kissed it softly, staring at the older woman with a bit 
of regret in her eyes.

&quot;...What is it? You look so doleful.&quot;

&quot;Do you really think we can make this work?&quot; Abi whispered. &quot;I mean...I 
love you, but I&#39;m not a commitment girl, not even when I&#39;m faced with a 
goddess like you. I get scared, Janna. I guess it&#39;s just an addiction to 
the newness of the relationship. And if you get too attached to a 
person, you can get hurt.&quot;

&quot;But I won&#39;t hurt you, Abi.&quot; Cerio smiled sadly, slid down, and wedged 
herself onto Janna&#39;s lap, making the older woman groan in pleasure. How 
many girls had wished they were now in this circumstance?! Abi curled an 
arm around Janna&#39;s shoulders and stroked her face.

&quot;I know you won&#39;t, sweetheart, I know. But I get...scared. I know it&#39;s 
childish... Listen, someday I&#39;ll tell you why I&#39;m so messed up. It&#39;s a 
really tragic story, you know, full of pain and heartache. For now, 
though...please...don&#39;t leave me. Don&#39;t give up on me. Don&#39;t let me give 
up on myself, please...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t,&quot; she promised, taking Abi&#39;s hands to her lips. Cerio quickly 
pulled their faces together and laid a deep, loving kiss on Janna&#39;s 
mouth, holding the sweetness in until they were interrupted.

&quot;Umm...&quot; They turned around and grinned shyly at Ana Lu. &quot;As much as I&#39;m 
enjoying this free show, I kinda have a test to take. Sorry, Miss 
Cerio.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I should get back to my room. You two lovely ladies take 
care now.&quot; She turned around and gave them both a wink, then walked back 
out the door, hips swaying sensually. Even Ana stared.

&quot;Miss Lu,&quot; groaned Janna, &quot;please keep your eyes off my girlfriend.&quot; Ana 
giggled and apologized, and waited for the others to arrive.

.........

With a mighty cry of triumph, Blake Baum threw her hands up in the air 
and rushed out the door as quickly as she could, a mere blur in the sea 
of women pouring out of the school after the very last bell of the very 
last day went off. Only the teachers and faculty stayed behind, hardly 
containing their grins as they watched their students plow through, some 
clearly more eager than most to get out and start their summer vacation. 
They would see the senior class one more time, at graduation, but still, 
the feelings of nostalgia wouldn&#39;t let go. Hitomi Madsen sighed as the 
last woman left her sight, and regarded the now-empty school with an 
exaltation of relief. What a year!!

&quot;Miss Madsen!&quot; Uh-oh, one left. But Hitomi was more than happy to see 
this one: it was, after all, one of her favorite students, the 
metamorphosized Alexandra Blair. She ran over to her amazed teacher, and 
before either of them could say anything, she gave her a big hug.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered, from the bottom of her heart. &quot;Thank you so 
much. For everything.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome, dear. I hope to see you again next year.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll try and sign up. And don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll help you whip the new 
girls into shape.&quot; Hitomi chuckled merrily, hugging Allie again and 
again. What a sweet young woman! And to think this girl had once been 
the muck of society, dredged up from the sewers like a rat. It was 
people like her that kept Hitomi and the other teachers going, amidst 
turmoil and uncertainty and worst of all, awful paychecks. They were 
here not only to teach, but to guide and improve, and no doubt their 
efforts would impact countless other girls for many years to come.

&quot;I will miss you, Alex,&quot; Hitomi whispered at last, touching the girl&#39;s 
golden hair affectionately. &quot;I&#39;ve had such a wonderful year. I don&#39;t 
know how next year will surpass it, but somehow this school always 
surprises me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...anyway, I better go. I&#39;m sure you have, uh...more important 
matters to attend to.&quot; She nodded in the direction behind her teacher, 
where Miss Keeping hung back shyly. Hitomi looked around and grinned.

&quot;And you do too, I suppose. I hope you and Corona have a long and happy 
life together.&quot;

&quot;Same to you, &#145;Tomi-chan&#39;.&quot; Allie beamed mercilessly, embarrassing her 
poor teacher before skipping off. Abigail Keeping shook her head, sighed 
wearily, and wondered just how many strange things would happen once the 
next year came along.

That evening, a small party was held at Shakenstein&#39;s, where everything 
seemed to start and now, would end. The burger-and-shake restaurant was 
going out of business due to customer negligence, and these few 
bittersweet days would be its last. To celebrate the end of another 
great year, Lilian invited as many of her friends as she could imagine 
to the restaurant to see it off in style. Sitting next to her was 
Gabrielle, her wonderful girlfriend and soulmate; across from them were 
Blake and Usha, chatting wildly about how they&#39;d spend three whole 
months languishing in freedom. Olivia was also there, celebrating the 
end of her worst job with the Fox sisters, and even Mira and Rozalia had 
made it.

&quot;I feel good now that those finals are gone!&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed. 
&quot;Jeez...they were killers. A dyslexic like me shouldn&#39;t hafta be 
subjected to such torture.&quot;

&quot;Oh, pipe down!&quot; Blake belted, mirthful and loud. &quot;We all had it tough! 
I forgot my stinking meds! Olivia was having leg cramps! Victoria had 
the cold! And I don&#39;t even wanna know what Janine was going through.&quot;

&quot;She looked so cosmic,&quot; Olivia mused. &quot;Whatever could make her face 
contort like that? I tried interrogating her, but she...well, she just 
said she&#39;d tell me later, as if it was something important.&quot; An eerie 
pause overcame the girls as their minds started working and theories 
began to formulate.

&quot;You don&#39;t think...?&quot;

&quot;What? You mean with May?&quot;

&quot;Girls, let&#39;s not talk about that,&quot; Usha insisted, having to raise her 
voice. &quot;I&#39;d much rather focus on what we&#39;re doing for vacation. I&#39;m glad 
that Blake and I don&#39;t have any obligations to fulfill this summer. We 
have some catching up to do!&quot; She and the soccer star grinned at each 
other and rubbed noses, delighting some and sickening others.

&quot;T-M-I,&quot; called Rozy. She looked over at Mira and laughed. &quot;God, I&#39;m 
surrounded by weirdoes and exhibitionists. Can you believe it?&quot;

&quot;Get used to it,&quot; Mira mumbled; &quot;they&#39;re like that all the time.&quot;

&quot;I noticed.&quot; Mira chuckled and gave her new friend a nudge.

&quot;You don&#39;t like it?&quot;

&quot;Public displays of affection sicken me. It&#39;s like they&#39;re slapping me 
with their romance and stuff. I hate it.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t like romance?&quot; cooed Mira, taking Rozy&#39;s hand softly. Miklos 
shrugged.

&quot;Well, considering my past, I&#39;m not exactly open to it. I got scared off 
by a girl I thought was a guy, and then I almost get raped by this other 
person. Coincidentally, both people I met online.&quot; She chuckled sadly 
and added, &quot;I guess I better start looking around the real world, huh?&quot; 
Mira nodded, then scooted a little closer. She lowered her voice and 
caressed her friend&#39;s hand, wanting to comfort her without alarming her.

&quot;I am sorry you have had such experiences. You must understand, Kimmy, 
not every man is like that. I&#39;ve known plenty of great guys who I would 
love to date if I weren&#39;t a dyke. And I&#39;ve also known plenty of women 
who could be total assholes, like Yusha over there.&quot; She looked over and 
stuck her tongue out; Usha didn&#39;t see it, for her attention (and tongue) 
was wrapped around something else.

&quot;But why were you afraid of that girl?&quot; she asked gently. Rozalia felt 
horrible on the inside. Mira was being sweet to her and she liked the 
attention, but did she really want to open that door up? Of course, she 
had already let one big skeleton out of her closet, so why not another?

&quot;At first I thought she was a guy. The name was &#145;Joe&#39;, so of course I&#39;d 
be confused. I had a big crush on Joe after about a month, and thought I 
was in love. I even sent her&#151;Joe, I mean&#151;a really steamy email, mostly 
about how I wanted to kiss...them. When I got a reply, it was from 
someone named...Joella, and she...well, she said she wanted to kiss me 
too. I was so freaked out I actually deleted the whole thing and stopped 
playing. I even renounced my subscription to the game. Of course now, I 
feel horrible about breaking her heart. I didn&#39;t mean to, I just...well, 
you know, I was just scared.&quot;

&quot;So how do you feel about girls now?&quot; asked Mira, maybe pushing things 
too far. She got burned for it.

&quot;I don&#39;t know!!&quot; Rozy screamed. &quot;Damn it, I don&#39;t know. Don&#39;t ask me 
that question, Mira, please.&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to push you. Sorry.&quot; She 
caressed Rozalia&#39;s hand tenderly, wishing there was more she could do to 
heal this wonderful woman. For the time being, there was only one thing 
Mira van Dijk could do, and she was doing it now. &quot;Kimmy,&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;I just want to be your friend, that&#39;s all I want. I 
just...want us both to be happy. You really are special to me.&quot; Rozalia 
finally calmed down, and took a few breaths. She then looked at Mira, 
right into her deep eyes, and finally squeezed her hand back.

&quot;Thanks, Mira. You&#39;re...a really good friend.&quot;

......

The group finally went their separate ways an hour after lunch, but not 
without saying one last farewell to Shakenstein&#39;s. Olivia and Alisha 
left to spend quality time together (the younger Fox sister tagging 
along impatiently), and Blake and Usha went to the Baum household for 
some &quot;extracurricular activities&quot;. That left Gabrielle and Lilian all by 
themselves, all the better since they exchanged several steamy kisses.

&quot;I need to go, schatz,&quot; Lilian whispered after the third long embrace, 
smiling just faintly. &quot;I&#39;ve got some things that still need to be done. 
I&#39;ll call you as soon as I can in the morning, all right?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Gabrielle gave her soulmate a beautiful smile and one last peck 
before letting her drift away. Since Lilian was going to graduate from 
high school in just a few days, she was already going through the 
process of finding her own place. Earlier, she had went with Gabrielle 
to look for apartments, and found a nice cozy one that would allow her 
to keep her two dogs. Gabrielle noted with some interest that Lilian&#39;s 
future bed could easily house two, and wondered just what kinds of 
purposes it would serve.

&quot;I will have lots of company,&quot; Lilian had purred, stroking her 
girlfriend&#39;s shaggy red hair. &quot;I will need somewhere for them to sleep, 
won&#39;t I?&quot; O&#39;Shannon had giggled and leaned in for a smooch, the innuendo 
fairly obvious. Lilian had already filled out the paperwork and even 
paid for the first month&#39;s rent, so now all that was left was moving. 
Gab and her pals volunteered to help, but Lilian didn&#39;t want them to 
worry. She had hired professionals to do the job, and they were almost 
finished.

Gabrielle got Lilian&#39;s call around eleven the next day. She was happy to 
finally be able to sleep in, and was glad that Lilian chose a more 
suitable time of day to call her up. She said the apartment was finally 
ready, albeit missing one small, redheaded, cheerful piece. Gabrielle 
squealed and drove over as soon as she could, packing breakfast with her 
as her pulse skyrocketed with anticipation. At seventeen years old just 
recently, she was still too young to live on her own, but there were no 
doubts that come this time next year, she would move in as Lilian&#39;s 
solid roommate and lover, spending the rest of her days with the 
beautiful albino who had so readily captured her heart.

So even though it was raining, the future looked bright for the two of 
them.

......

Blake and Usha spent their first day of summer vacation (the day after 
the last day of classes) with each other&#151;but things didn&#39;t get romantic 
until later. The two girlfriends spent most of the day playing soccer in 
the mud. It was a rainy, drizzly day, wet and slippery everywhere, and 
the mud was a nice rich brown color, bubbling and churning with life. 
Usha put on her most expendable piece of clothing&#151;sweatpants and an old 
blue T-shirt she didn&#39;t care for&#151;and took to the fields with excitement. 
She and Blake stayed out for hours, getting soaked to the bone and so 
muddy that not a single area of skin was spared. They didn&#39;t keep score, 
and actually wrestled more than they played.

They went inside before they drowned, laughing and dripping mud 
everywhere. Naturally, Blake&#39;s parents would be furious if their 
daughter and her girlfriend trekked mud through the house, so they both 
stripped down to their underwear and carried their filthy clothes into 
the nearest bathroom, which was just a few careful steps from the back 
door. Seeing as how they were now inside a bathroom, they decided to 
just go buff, and peeled each other&#39;s clothes off, exposing pale pink 
and beautiful ochre.

&quot;You are so sexy,&quot; Usha breathed, taking in the full sight of her naked 
girlfriend. Blake blushed and tried to shy away, still self-conscious 
about her bust and thighs. Usha thought she looked terrific, and gave a 
squeal as she chased the younger woman down and tackled her. &quot;Oh no you 
don&#39;t! I&#39;m going to clean you up, you dirty little girl!&quot; Blake laughed 
and screamed with delight as she and Usha stuffed themselves in the 
shower...although cleaning each other was not necessarily high on their 
list of priorities. And this was just the first day of summer&#151;who knew 
what mischief these two new lovers would find in the endless weeks to 
come?

......

Mihoshi and Kula didn&#39;t get the chance to see each other when school let 
out until very late in the month. Yuki was going to attend a special 
karate camp over summer, and wouldn&#39;t be able to see her new girlfriend 
until the weekends. Kula might&#39;ve hated this arrangement if she had been 
given a blank slab for a schedule, but her parents surprised her by 
enrolling her in a two-month &quot;surf camp&quot;, a place specially designed for 
people who wanted to surf but couldn&#39;t make it to the beach. This also 
let her off on the weekends, so both girls were too busy having the time 
of their lives to worry about romance.

Each weekend was special, though, with most of their meetings being held 
in the Nanahara household. Kula&#39;s parents only expressed mild surprise 
that her daughter had a girlfriend (her brothers teased her about it and 
got an optical beating), a warm surprise to Yuki, who feared the worst. 
She spent many beautiful Friday and Saturday nights in that house, going 
on friendly dates, learning how to skate and surf, and even introduced 
Kula to the samurai film genre, which she soon became addicted to. In 
return, Kula gave Mihoshi love, sweet love, for many endless starry 
nights and beyond.

One weekend, Mihoshi suggested they do something risky: stay the evening 
at her house. Mihoshi badly wanted Kula to meet her parents, even if the 
whole thing would be awkward. Over the time they had spent together, 
Yuki constantly assured her girlfriend that her parents were no longer 
so intolerant to her sexual preference, that they were apprehensively 
okay with it, and to meet the object of her affections would be a high 
honor. But still, Kula was unsure.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Yuki-chan,&quot; she sighed, looking down at the Kogure House 
welcome mat. &quot;I still get the feeling they won&#39;t like me. I mean, let&#39;s 
face it, I ain&#39;t too delicate. You like me fine, but...&quot;

&quot;Trust me, Kula-chan,&quot; whispered her love, reaching out to squeeze her 
hand. Kula smiled and squeezed back, and together, they knocked on the 
door and waited to be let inside.

......

To celebrate the end of a momentous school year, Allie and her father 
(and Corona) were invited to Janet Keys&#39; house for supper. While the two 
adults talked and helped each other with the meal, Allie and Corona 
idled away in front of a TV, watching sitcoms together. Jocelyn was 
away, visiting her biological mother for the first time since the 
abusive woman was taken away. There was no doubt in any of their minds 
that some strain would come up&#151;after all, so much had happened since 
those early, bleak days&#151;but Janet had given her foster daughter all the 
support she could, so now it was up to Jocelyn to see things through.

After going through customs, Joss approached the Plexiglas window and 
sat down before it, reaching for the telephone. Her mother had never 
been beautiful, but now she looked scraggly and defeated, just as Joss 
hoped she would. The woman deserved to be in places much worse than this 
place for what she did, and no amount of talking would ever make up for 
the abuse. Jocelyn didn&#39;t even know if she could forgive the person she 
had once called Mom.

&quot;You&#39;ve grown up,&quot; came Mrs. McKeough&#39;s tight voice. She sighed and 
stared at her daughter intensely. &quot;You&#39;re a real woman now, Jocelyn. I&#39;m 
glad to see you&#39;re all right. How has your foster family been treating 
you?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she answered, not wanting to say any more than necessary to this 
monster. Her mother sighed again, as if it was a strain just to sit 
there.

&quot;You have every right to hate me, Joss, and I wouldn&#39;t blame you if you 
did. What I did was wrong, and I know I couldn&#39;t apologize enough for 
it. You may not believe it, but I&#39;ve really been trying to change in 
here. I&#39;ve gone to counseling, I&#39;ve seen a psychiatrist, I&#39;ve been to 
group therapy...I&#39;ve even spoken with the prison chaplain. I&#39;ve been 
going to the church in here a lot.&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t care,&quot; Jocelyn whispered softly. &quot;I just came...to tell 
you that my life now is ten times better than it&#39;s ever been. The woman 
who&#39;s taking care of me is more like a real mother than you could ever 
be. I have lots of friends, somebody I love very much...I even have a 
son. Everything&#39;s going so well.&quot;

&quot;A son? You&#39;re a mother now?&quot; Mrs. McKeough sounded doubtful. She 
remembered a boyfriend hanging around in the past, but were they really 
that serious? Yet her daughter was not the kind to lie, and why lie 
about a new baby? She managed a smile and whispered, &quot;That&#39;s good. 
You&#39;ll be a wonderful mother. Much better than I was. ...I really miss 
you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your own fault you&#39;re in here,&quot; Joss bit. &quot;What you did was 
reprehensible. I stopped thinking of myself as your daughter a long time 
ago. Janet Keys is my mother now. I don&#39;t ever want to see you again.&quot;

&quot;Joss, wait!&quot; Jocelyn hung up the phone and stood to leave, her mother 
wailing for her. &quot;Jocelyn, please! Forgive me! In the name of Christ 
Almighty, I beg of you to forgive me!&quot; Jocelyn paused in her exit, and 
turned just enough so her mother could hear her chilling retort.

&quot;Didn&#39;t I beg you?&quot; And then she was gone, leaving her mother to weep in 
despondency.

When she came home, she buried herself in Janet&#39;s arms and wept quietly.

&quot;This is my home,&quot; she said, her voice muffled. &quot;This is my real home. 
You&#39;re my real mother.&quot; And with a smile, she looked over and saw Allie 
and Corona, waving her over. &quot;And they,&quot; she added quietly, &quot;are my 
friends. Soon, hopefully, members of this same family.&quot; She gave her 
mother a kiss and joined the girls, who welcomed her in their embrace, 
three women who had known the deepest limits of pain&#151;only to come out 
shining and strong in the end.

......

Amina was happy that she was staying over at Nomi&#39;s for the night, and 
even happier that their first year at Stanton had gone so well. She 
never expected to find a kindred spirit in that school, let alone one 
her own age&#151;and yet there they were, as close as sisters, staying in the 
same house and later, sharing the same bed, as they had so many times 
before. The two young girls, both of them now fifteen years old, spent 
most of their evening sharing sweet, short, tender kisses, holding hands 
as their lips met and danced. Sleepiness overcame them shortly before 
midnight, and they were soon at rest, nestled in each other&#39;s arms.

Amina woke up to a bleary darkness somewhere around two in the morning, 
her bladder pulsating. It was the price she paid for drinking so much 
soda... After carefully padding to the bathroom and flushing quietly, 
she came back and cuddled under the covers, next to her sweet Nomi, who 
was blissfully unaware of this sojourn. Amina took a long time to stare 
at the other girl in the darkness, and reached out to comb her smooth 
hair. Such a pretty sight...

&quot;(I have to tell you now,)&quot; she dared to whisper. &quot;(I have something I 
need to say to you. It&#39;s...unusual, so I think this is a good time. I 
know it&#39;s cowardly, but I still can&#39;t gather the courage to say it to 
you. I&#39;ll just...let it out while you&#39;re asleep.)&quot; She leaned down to 
gently kiss Nomi&#39;s ear, and with her veins jammed with a nervous pulse, 
she barely breathed out her confession.

I&#39;m in love with you, Nomi Nakatori.

&quot;Odd, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she murmured, burying herself under the covers. &quot;When 
the year began, I didn&#39;t consider myself into girls at all. I went on a 
friendship date with Erica Fox, and I really liked her, but I didn&#39;t 
think I would like her in that way. And then we became close, like two 
stars that must run through the dark skies for ages until they meet each 
other at last. I don&#39;t quite know how you feel about me&#151;maybe all this 
kissing has you thinking I&#39;m just a really good friend&#151;but I love you, 
no mistake. And someday,&quot; she added, &quot;I&#39;ll tell it to you for real. 
Until then, let&#39;s hold each other close and dream.&quot; She kissed Nomi on 
her cheek, and held the girl in her arms until she returned to that hazy 
land called Nippon, to wait until dawn.

......

&quot;So what&#39;s this you wanted to show me?&quot; asked Ayanna as Hero led her 
into her room. The other girl turned around shyly.

&quot;Don&#39;t get the wrong idea here,&quot; she warned as she delicately lifted her 
shirt up. Ayanna&#39;s eyes flew open. Was Hero stripping for her?

&quot;Uh, wrong idea? Why no, why on Earth would I get that?&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Hero grinned as she removed her brassiere. Ayanna had seen 
her girlfriend&#39;s generous breasts before, amongst other private things, 
but it was always a treat revisiting familiar territory. This time, 
Hero&#39;s fleshy globes were decorated with more than just happiness and a 
clean smell: each nipple bore a shining, tiny gold ring around it, 
making them even more alluring than usual. Ayanna balked.

&quot;Oh my God, did you get them pierced?!&quot;

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Hero said, sheepishly tugging at the rings. &quot;They&#39;re 
clip-ons. I&#39;m too much of a chicken to have them pierced for real. 
Anyway, this way I can put them wherever I want, like my nose or 
eyebrow.&quot; Ayanna grinned, unable to stray her eyes from the hypnotic 
golden bands. Hero always was a wild kid, and getting such an erogenous 
part of her body decorated was just another example. Too bad they 
weren&#39;t authentic! Otherwise, Ayanna would&#39;ve really had some fun.

&quot;They&#39;re gorgeous,&quot; she said, touching them delicately. Hero whined from 
the slightest brush and buckled, feeling orgasmic shockwaves coming at 
her from all sides.

&quot;Ahh, don&#39;t, please, it&#39;s torture. I better put my bra on before you go 
nuts. Jeez.&quot; Ayanna laughed and apologized, and did admit that her 
girlfriend looked more sophisticated with clothes on. &quot;Well, now that 
that&#39;s over with, maybe I can retire from exhibitionism and discuss what 
I really brought you in here for.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so you used your sexy little nipples as bait? Honestly, Hero, 
that&#39;s not very Christian of you.&quot;

&quot;Shut up,&quot; she said as they both giggled.

&quot;So what is it, if I may ask?&quot;

&quot;Well, here&#39;s the thing. I told you this before, but it warrants another 
explanation. You know how I said I always went to church camp every 
summer for two weeks, right? And I never miss it, not for anything else. 
Well, it&#39;s coming up, so...&quot;

&quot;So...you&#39;re going to be gone for two weeks,&quot; she surmised. &quot;Ah, I see. 
So that&#39;s the announcement. Well, it sucks, but&#151;&quot;

&quot;Wait, wait, why does it suck? I&#39;d like to invite you to come along with 
me.&quot; Ayanna gave Hero a doubtful look, shaking her head with a subtle 
sadness. Hero knew that Ayanna and Church didn&#39;t mix, and if she went 
with her on this two-week getaway, amidst a whole flock of 
Bible-thumping kids&#151;most of them, no doubt, sorely against the thought 
of two girls in love&#151;she would probably regret it. But...it was two 
whole weeks, and it was up to her to decide whether she wanted to spend 
it with her girlfriend or without her.

&quot;...And those are my options,&quot; she mused, crossing her arms in deep 
thought. &quot;Hero, honey, you know I&#39;d love to come with you, and I&#39;d miss 
you badly while you were gone, but...I dunno. I wouldn&#39;t feel 
comfortable there. I&#39;d feel like everyone would be judging me and 
watching my every move. And...I don&#39;t want to hide from them the fact 
that I love you. I&#39;ll want to share your dorm, hold your hand, and kiss 
you as I please. That&#39;s who I am; I&#39;m gay and I&#39;m proud of it, and I&#39;m 
proud to be your girlfriend. But...Love, church and Ayanna Montgomery do 
not mix.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s up to you,&quot; relented Hero. &quot;There&#39;s no pressure. I just thought 
I&#39;d invite you since...well, you know. I&#39;m going to go no matter what, 
but it won&#39;t be nearly as fun without you. I have a blast each year, 
trust me, and I know you&#39;d have fun too.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sitting around a campfire singing hymnals.&quot; Hero winced. 
Yeah...that was something these camps were infamous for, amongst other 
things. Ayanna gave her a reassuring smile and placed her lips on the 
girl&#39;s nose. &quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; she promised quietly. &quot;When should I 
give you my answer?&quot;

&quot;Well, camp doesn&#39;t start until sometime in June, so you&#39;ve got until 
then. Don&#39;t worry&#151;like I said, no pressure.&quot; Ayanna grinned, and agreed 
to have her answer by that time. Until then...

......

Ivory had planned to spend her entire &quot;summer of love&quot; with Ancelin and 
her family, but she received some distressing news that turned her whole 
schedule upside-down. Madeline Yi had finally amassed enough money to 
afford a real vacation, and she and her daughter were going to fly to 
Versailles, France to visit some family. Kiki was going as well, though 
she paid her own fare. The girls really wanted Ivory to come along, but 
even between the four of them, they couldn&#39;t scrounge up enough for 
another plane ticket. Ivory was crestfallen when she heard the news, but 
she tried to put on a good face.

&quot;You two deserve to have a vacation,&quot; she said, holding Ancelin close. 
They wouldn&#39;t part for a week, but every day until then would be 
difficult. The three women would be gone all summer long and wouldn&#39;t 
return to the states until two weeks before the next school year, so 
Ivory dreaded the day she would have to part with her beloved. &quot;You&#39;ve 
earned it,&quot; she reasoned. &quot;Go on, have a good time. I mean it. Just 
please don&#39;t forget to call me and write a few letters.&quot;

&quot;Of course we won&#39;t,&quot; Ancelin promised her, stroking that beautiful face 
she had grown to love. &quot;We&#39;ll keep in touch as often as we can. Besides, 
you need to spend more time with Farrah anyway. I think she&#39;s just about 
at her breaking point.&quot;

&quot;The girl does know how to bitch effectively,&quot; Tran agreed. She sighed 
and embraced Ancelin again, despite the considerable stretch of time 
they had before they left each other. They had grown so close in such a 
short period of time! Had it only been nine months since they first met? 
It seemed like it was eons ago. Already she was crying a little&#151;imagine 
how many more tears she would weep once the fateful day came!

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay, honey,&quot; Ancelin whispered lovingly. She kissed Ivory&#39;s 
lips and hands delicately, treasuring each touch. &quot;It&#39;s only for about 
two months. We can last that long. Think of it as a turning point in our 
relationship. And...you know,&quot; she added seductively, &quot;when I get back, 
I&#39;ll have a special treat for you.&quot; Ivory&#39;s face turned red as she 
grinned.

&quot;Wonder what that could be.&quot; She and Ancelin kissed again, and left each 
other&#39;s company for the day, each to her own thing. Two whole months 
apart... Well, it wasn&#39;t really so bad. Ancelin needed the vacation, and 
Ivory owed it to Farrah to keep her company over the summer. That 
boyfriend of hers was so unpredictable...

As it stood, Farrah announced she was getting back together with Tristan 
again, sounding elated and bubbly. Ivory muttered some unintelligible 
curse, all the more glad that she was attracted to girls, and 
specifically, her treasured Ancelin. Kwong said that her friend was just 
jealous.

&quot;Hey Fare-fare,&quot; she murmured one slow day, her lover gone and her 
friend silently present, &quot;can I ask a personal question?&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; They were close enough for it; they didn&#39;t mind. Ivory sat up.

&quot;What&#39;s it like, making love to a man? I&#39;ve been curious for awhile, and 
seeing as how you two are sleeping together...&quot;

&quot;Well, not so much anymore,&quot; Farrah told her. &quot;We&#39;ve only had sex twice, 
but it was great each time. I don&#39;t know how to explain it, it&#39;s 
just...well, I guess it&#39;s sort of when a girl fingers you, but better. 
It&#39;s five times better than masturbation.&quot;

&quot;No shit,&quot; Tran gawked. &quot;But what about...I mean, when he comes inside 
you? I mean, did he wear a condom?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; she snorted. &quot;I don&#39;t plan on getting pregnant for at least 
five more years. I guess I can&#39;t explain it any better than that. A 
goofy lesbo like you would obviously never find out, unless Annie-kins 
decides to wear a strap-on!&quot;

&quot;You be quiet!&quot; snapped Ivory, grabbing her friend in a headlock. The 
two wrestled and giggled together for awhile until Ivory&#39;s mother 
interrupted them. Tran personally detested the older woman, and spent as 
much time apart from her as possible. Mrs. Tran usually didn&#39;t allow 
horseplay when Farrah (or for that matter, any of Ivory&#39;s flings) was 
around, so she was probably going to yell at her for that. But this 
time, it was something different.

&quot;Ivory!&quot;

&quot;Whaddya want?&quot; she belted, and muttered under her breath, &quot;Stupid 
bitch.&quot;

&quot;Phone for you!&quot; Ivory&#39;s heart suddenly raced with hope. Could it be?

&quot;Is it Ancelin?!&quot;

&quot;Who? No, god&#151;it&#39;s your father. He wants to talk to you.&quot;

&quot;My father??&quot; Ivory nearly went into cardiac arrest. The Tran girls were 
not on speaking terms with their absent patriarch&#151;Mother hated him for 
various reasons, and Ivory resented him for never calling or sending 
letters before&#151;yet the mere prospect of talking to her father outweighed 
all other problems. Ivory could only think of the good times they had 
had together as she excused herself from Farrah, ran to pick up the 
phone in her room, and shakily spoke into it.

&quot;......Papa?&quot;
