<h1>Descent: Child of Shadows (part 7 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/descent-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>        Samantha Teresa looked over at the black haired woman, taking in 
the transformation that she had just undergone. Gone were the most 
obvious signs of demonic nature, instead she simply looked human. &#39;A 
beautiful, black haired woman with an aura of evil, but human,&#39; Sam 
mused.

        &quot;What?&quot; Descent asked her curiously.

        &quot;So how are we going down to the docks?&quot; Sam asked curiously.

        &quot;This,&quot; Decent led the way towards a sports car that waiting in 
the shadows. Sitting low to the ground and painted blood red it glowed 
in the darkness, a expensive little ride.

        &quot;This is yours?&quot; Sam blinked.

        &quot;Nope,&quot; Descent twirled a set of keys around her finger as she 
climbed into the driver&#39;s seat, &quot;I grabbed the keys off one of those 
goons back in the alley.&quot;

        &quot;Oddly poetic,&quot; Sam admitted, climbing into the passenger side. 
She tossed a worried look at Descent, &quot;You do know how to drive, right?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Descent started up the car, pulling out on to the 
street. She kept her eyes focused on traffic as she said, &quot;I wasn&#39;t 
always a demon, you know.&quot; Quietly she began to explain, a tale of a 
foolish sorceress, a badly made deal, and the eventual possession of 
this demon&#39;s form.

        Sam listened, considering the comforting weight of the guns she 
wore under her priest&#39;s garb. &#39;Whatever she is,&#39; Sam mused, &#39;&quot;she&#39;s not 
without guilt in this.&#39; Aloud she asked, &quot;So why are you attacking 
Diana&#39;s operations?&quot;

        &quot;I can&#39;t undo the harm I allowed the demon lord to do,&quot; Descent 
said, &quot;or restore the lives taken. The best I can do is try to balance 
the scales in whatever small ways I can.&quot;

        &quot;Jess would be very amused to see me working with you,&quot; Sam 
muttered to herself.

        &quot;Eh?&quot; Descent blinked.

        &quot;Never mind,&quot; Sam shook her head. She grabbed the dashboard 
nervously as they squealed around a corner, &quot;So what are you planing?&quot;

        &quot;Get the slavers,&quot; Descent flashed a smile, &quot;save the captives, 
more or less.&quot;

        &quot;Great plan,&quot; Sam muttered.

        Descent nodded, &quot;I thought so.&quot; She looked over at Sam and said 
more seriously, &quot;I do have a plan, one that you could help me with, 
Samantha.&quot;

        &quot;Sam,&quot; she corrected calmly.

        Descent grinned and began to explain her idea....

        Lina felt a stab of irritation as she watched them herding the 
kids up onto the boat. This wasn&#39;t her sort of job, the slim blonde much 
preferred the drugs or weapons trade. At least there you didn&#39;t have the 
product looking up at you in fear.

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; one of her men ran up, his black hair messy as he 
passed the phone over, &quot;I think you&#39;d better hear this.&quot;

        &quot;Yes?&quot; Lina barked irritably. She listened for a few moments, 
then with a snarl she passed the phone over to her minion. &quot;Get the 
stragglers together,&quot; she said with a fierce scowl, &quot;the boat needs to 
move out now.&quot;

        &#39;They&#39;re working together?&#39; Lina thought as she headed over to 
the gangplank. A team had been sent to try to stop Descent in case she 
might have discovered this operation. They were probably going to loose, 
but at least they&#39;d delay the bitch. Instead she and that warrior priest 
had allied together, leaving the battlefield talking. &#39;I have no idea 
what will happen when they compare notes,&#39; she thought as a black haired 
man dragged a struggling girl aboard, &#39;and I don&#39;t want to find out.&#39;

        &quot;Where are the slaves kept?&quot; the roughly dressed young man 
demanded, holding on to the still struggling young girl.

        &quot;That way,&quot; the nearest man nodded towards a door leading below. 
The man in the suit turned towards the nearby dock, watching nervously 
as he held his machine pistol ready.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; and with fighting girl in tow he went through the 
door, looking around a moment to see if the coast was clear. Sam 
grinned, &quot;You can change back now.&quot;

        The little girl grew, her form shifting to a full grown Descent. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she smiled, &quot;I didn&#39;t know if I could have pulled that little 
deception off on my own.&quot;

        &quot;Hope my clothes will be all right back in the car,&quot; Sam 
muttered to herself, looking down at her borrowed black T-shirt and 
jeans. She pulled her pistol from it&#39;s concealment in the back of her 
pants, checking it over quickly.

        &quot;If not I&#39;ll get them back,&quot; Descent said as she made her way 
down the stairs. The two of them went below, discovering a set of bars 
and a group of young women secured behind them. She grabbed the lock and 
broke it with a single pull, &quot;Time to go.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am?&#39; one of the girls asked them tentatively, the redhead 
clearly creeped out by Descent&#39;s almost inhuman aura.

        Sam stepped forward to offer her hand, &quot;We&#39;re come to get you 
out of here.&quot;

        &quot;Where did she..&quot; one of the other girls squeaked.

        Sam turned, realizing that Descent had disappeared on her like 
smoke. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she muttered softly, &quot;what&#39;s she up to?&quot; The sound of 
gunfire exploded to life up above them and Sam groaned, &quot;I just had to 
ask.&quot;

        &quot;Shit,&quot; Lina cursed as the door exploded outwards, sending 
splinters and pieces of metal flying randomly across the deck. Then the 
icy blonde saw what had exploded the door and felt her stomach drop in 
fear.

        &quot;You know, the drugs and prostitution I really don&#39;t mind,&quot; 
Descent said conversationally as she picked a gunman up and tossed him 
off the deck, &quot;but slaves? That irritates me.&quot;

        &quot;Kill her,&quot; Lina yelled, her people moving almost as soon as she 
spoke.

        As her people charged to battle Lina ran to the aft of the ship, 
pausing as she stood there looking at the churning water. She knew how 
this fight was going to end, and wanted no part of it. With a smooth 
gesture she pulled her coat off, dropped her gun and dove off.

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Descent growled, grabbing a machine gun before it could 
go off. She yanked it away, tossing it just before she threw the owner 
after it.

        &quot;Die!&quot; the man swung down with a sword, nearly taking her head 
off.

        Descent found herself moving without a thought, the shape of her 
body shifting instinctively. &quot;Cool,&quot; she blinked, the newly formed sword 
gleaming in her hand. She parried his next two strikes, disarmed him, 
then kicked him somewhere painful.

        &quot;Bitch,&quot; a voice hissed angrily.

        Two men, the last of the goons, stood as a distance, pistols 
trained on Descent. They were far enough away to make disarming them 
difficult, at least one would be able to get a shot off. The other man 
grinned, &quot;We may not be able to kill you, but we can make you hurt!&quot;

        Bang! Bang!

        The guns flew away as two shots rang out. Smoke and the odd 
scent of incense curled up as Sam held her gun on them steadily, the 
look in her eyes dangerous. Behind the woman the captives looked at 
their former captors with murder in their eyes.

        &quot;Oh shit,&quot; the first man groaned. Both men ran to the side and 
threw themselves over, deciding to take their chances swimming to shore.

        Descent smiled slightly as she looked over at Sam and said, &quot;I 
didn&#39;t really need the help, but thanks anyway.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Sam said with a smile. She slipped the gun away, 
looking around them curiously, &quot;Do you know how to drive this boat?&quot;

        &quot;Sail,&quot; Descent corrected her, &quot;and we&#39;ll figure it out.&quot;

        A few mishaps with the engine and wheel later they were at the 
docks once more, the girls streaming down the gangplank to waiting 
police officers. Descent had gotten her and Sam clear, growing a set of 
leathery wings to carry them away by air.

        &quot;Can we trust turning them over to the police?&quot; Sam asked softly 
as she pulled her priest&#39;s garb back on. Grimly she added, &quot;I understand 
that the Lady has a great deal of influence.&quot;

        &quot;News media,&quot; Descent nodded to where reporters were converging 
on the police and victims. &quot;Even if they wanted to cover this up, they 
won&#39;t now,&quot; she shrugged.

        &quot;Good enough,&quot; Sam agreed. She turned to walk away, then paused. 
&quot;Lady Diana tried to use me. I don&#39;t like that. So for the time being, 
I&#39;ll be sticking around town,&quot; she said. With that she walked to the 
edge of the roof, climbing down via a emergency ladder.

        &quot;Wonder if that&#39;s good or bad,&quot; Descent murmured to herself 
softly.

        Not that far away, Lina pulled herself to shore, her clothes 
soaking wet. She rummaged though her pockets, finally pulling out a 
cellphone. She flipped it open and hit the speed dial, &quot;Grace? The 
slaving operation just went up in smoke.&quot;

        Grace&#39;s voice was as smooth as velvet, &quot;The lady will not be 
happy to hear that.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve got worse news,&quot; Lina said calmly. She waited a moment, 
&quot;It seems that the demon and the priest are working together.&quot;</pre>
