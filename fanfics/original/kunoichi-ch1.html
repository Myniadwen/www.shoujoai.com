<h1>Burning Spirit, Kunoichi! (part 1 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Year is 2023. For the past two decades the respective 
nations of Japan and America have sought dominance over the 
military weapons industry. Through a mysterious chain of events 
that appear to have been influenced by both political and social 
stimulus, America finally gained victory. In a calculated surge; 
the economic structure of Japanese society collapsed when a 
barricade was placed upon its major exports of electronics, 
steel and chemicals, by America and Western Europe. With its key 
sources of trade blocked from its main demand; waves of societal 
unrest seeped into the land. Fearing a political ousting from 
parliament, the Prime Minister of that time sold off his 
democratic influence to the four people who could help restore 
Japan to what it once was. These mysterious benefactors were the 
Four Koga. Each one a member and leader of an elite family to 
have existed throughout Japanese History. With the Prime 
Minister in their debt, and financial supremacy in their favour; 
the Four Koga set about fully establishing their grips on power.  
Each Koga was assigned to rule over a respective major island of 
Japan. Honshu, Kyushu, Hokkaido and Shikoku. Each island fell 
victim to the rule of one of the powerful shinobi lords while 
the Prime Minister and Parliament controlled the country in name 
only. 

Few know the truth about the Four Koga. Those that do never live 
long enough to utter a word about them. Because under the 
service of each Koga is a powerful modern ninja clan that 
eliminates anyone standing in the way of their leaders. 

But, in this year of 2023, there is unrest between the Four 
Koga. The bonds that once linked them as kin are now breaking to 
facilitate their own desires for Japan. Will the country be 
swallowed up by the corruption of the Koga? Or is there someone 
willing to take a stand against them before that happens...?

Yui&#39;s Apartment

It was her first day in Tokyo.

To be honest about it all, she was a little nervous. After all, 
this was Tokyo. Centre of the Japanese world. And Yui had known 
of it only through the media. Up until now. Now she was living 
the experiences of the wonderfully big city. It was vast, 
colourful, quick-paced and overwhelming; something the people 
might expect little country-girl Hazumaru Yui to be intimidated 
by.

She was.

But there was something that ran deeper than her intimidation. 
Like a feeling. Palpable and at the same time, remote. But still 
echoing there; somewhere back in Yui&#39;s head. It was a tingling 
that made her feel... strangely at home here. In a city where 
westernisation was the norm and Japanese traditions were seen 
for the state practices they were. It had only been a day since 
she left her parents in the Northern Honshu city of Morioka to 
come here. They were a little apprehensive too, but who could 
blame them? Tokyo was famous for all sorts of things. Most 
positive, some negative. For the folk who lived in the 
countryside and tried hard to maintain their prudent sense of 
national traditionalism; the negative aspects of the town took 
centrefold. And the same could be said for Yui&#39;s family. But 
they had decided it was her choice. A 17-year-old girl should be 
allowed to study where she wanted to. It was Yui&#39;s option and 
she had opted for Tokyo schooling. It was a little late in her 
high school life to be making such a drastic change in location. 
Especially since it meant leaving home early and living alone in 
the city. That in itself was the major reason that Yui&#39;s parents 
had been so difficult in being persuaded to allow this. And to a 
certain extent; Yui could understand their concern. But she had 
to do this. Start a new life. Meet new people. 

Settle old scores. 

The girl from Morioka slowly eased up from the slanted position 
she had slept in on her sofa. It had taken so long for the 
movers to shift everything in from the street last night that 
Yui collapsed onto her mauve couch the second they were done. 
She had actually woken up about an hour ago. But sometimes, 
after sleeping, it was just nice to wake up think for a little. 
About life, about the day, about herself. And about the real 
reason she was allowed to come to this city. Her parents were 
caring but could not afford the kind of tuition fees they charge 
at an elite Tokyo School. As hard as it was to believe; Yui&#39;s 
financial support came from the Hokkaido Koga herself. To think. 
The underground ruler of Hokkaido needed someone like Yui in her 
debt. It was a strange thought to her. But then... Yui was no 
ordinary 17-year-old girl. There were secrets within her that 
the many didn&#39;t understand and the few couldn&#39;t rightly mistake. 
She might not have been aware of the depths of these secrets in 
herself; but that made no difference to those who recognized her 
for what she truly was. 

Yui gave a quick yawn, blowing into a curled up fist. Then took 
a gander at her wrist watch. The sparkling green eyes of the 
country girl widened with shock at the time. She was actually 
running late for school! On her first day, no less! There was no 
time to be thinking over her other issues in Tokyo. For now, 
school came first. Her folks would kill her if they found out 
she was lazing about when she had to get to school. Yui peeled 
off the mauve of her couch and turned to the hallway of her 
apartment. She instantly went into the adjacent door which lead 
her right into her kitchen. Yui flicked to one side of the small 
kitchen and plugged in that electric kettle her parents had 
bought for her. It had been filled with water last night so 
there was no need to refill it. She flicked on the switch and 
let it stay until it came to the boil. The girl couldn&#39;t rightly 
start off her day without a cup of coffee. Even if caffeine was 
&#39;bad&#39; for her. &#39;Liquid Nicotine&#39; her Mom called it. Yui then 
scampered back out of the kitchen, into the hall and through to 
her bedroom. If there was one single benefit about living in a 
one-floor apartment it was the fact that you could get around it 
easily. The chocolate-haired teen strode up to her unmade bed 
and cast her eyes down on her uniform. That charmingly 
predictable navy blue and pearl white &#39;sailor-type&#39; uniform. She 
had taken the liberty of ironing it last night; while all the 
movers took care of her stuff. Which meant it was more than 
ready now. 

&quot;Alright then,&quot; Yui whispered to herself, &quot;It looks like I 
should start getting ready for my first day at my all new school 
before I&#39;m late!&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

National Diet Building 

&quot;What you are asking of me! It is madness!&quot;

Politicians.

Hirotsugu could only find one phrase suitable for them. But he 
was calm enough to withhold his anger on this account. They both 
needed things from each other. The Prime Minister, Fujiwara 
Jiro, needed the financial power of the Honshu Koga to retain 
his position. Even if it were in name only. And Hirotsugu needed 
that poser as a figurehead. The Koga had decided that it was 
better to rule Japan from the shadows and allow for a &#39;Puppet 
State&#39;. Prime Minister Fujiwara was the perfect candidate for 
the position of cover-boy. Whether he liked it or not. But it 
seemed that Fujiwara had forgotten his place. Mizuryu Hirotsugu 
was not the kind of man you turned down when he asked you for a 
favour. Or when he gave you an order. 

Those who knew him by the name, Honshu Koga, weren&#39;t so foolish. 

With fine ancient Japanese robes and smoothly woven tongue, 
Hirotsugu pulled a steep smile from his thin lips. He turned his 
back to both the Prime Minister and his desk, looking across 
this office from which the country was run. 

&quot;What I ask of you... is madness...?&quot; The iciness within the 
speech set the tone for the intent, &quot;I must ask you. Is a time 
tested policy of two-hundred years of peace the groundwork for a 
nightmare? I doubt this... just as I doubt your ability to see 
the inevitable.&quot;

Prime Minister Fujiwara stood up from his sleek plastic chair 
and slapped his hands upon his desk in urgency. &quot;Please 
reconsider! I cannot risk such radical announcements this close 
to my re-election! It is political suicide!&quot;

Hirotsugu tilted his head to one side. His ankle-long ponytail 
of tied grey hair danced around his legs with the action. 
&quot;Political suicide, you say? Interesting phrase you&#39;ve used to 
classify this. But I cannot imagine what you would mean. After 
all...&quot;

The older man&#39;s head swung back around and he cast the Prime 
Minister a glare that would send shivers down any sane man&#39;s 
spine. &quot;...You control this country in name only. The Four Koga 
are the real strength of Japan. We are the sword upon which the 
country must rely. And as I am sure you realize... there are 
hundreds of men who would die to possess the position that you 
hold. Regardless of how powerless it is.&quot;

And that statement made the Prime Minister shrink back with what 
little courage he was able to muster. Hirotsugu&#39;s truth hit home 
brutally. Fujiwara held no power at all. His actions all those 
years ago made the Four Koga the true controllers of Japan. He 
couldn&#39;t even stand up for himself anymore against their 
decisions. And this one was so much more crucial than the 
others. What Hirotsugu was speaking of... could Fujiwara 
actually propose such notions to Parliament and retain any sense 
of personal credibility? 

The Prime Minister slinked back into his chair and lowered his 
head downwards. His thick glasses tilted over his nose a bit. 
When he nudged them back into place with his index finger, a 
bead of sweat tricked down his cheek. &quot;...Please, 
Hirotsugu-dono. Please rethink this idea. No one will take to 
it... especially if it comes from me. My policies have been 
greatly frowned upon since...&quot;

&quot;...Since the Four Koga have started making those policies for 
you,&quot; Hirotsugu filled in those blanks for the PM, &quot;It is 
understandable. The populace you have governed have grown to 
distrust you. It was your xenophobic intent against the United 
States of America that brought along the Koga rule.&quot;

The PM blinked, pressing his palm into his chest. &quot;You regard me 
as xenophobic? What you have asked of me simply personifies it! 
Do you honestly wish me to decree a Closed Country to the 
members of Parliament!?&quot;

&quot;It worked for the Tokugawa,&quot; Hirotsugu quipped, &quot;It will work 
for the Four Koga. This nation of Japan has grown too reliant on 
foreign power. This is why the trade blockage with the 
Westerners damaged us so. What we need is a period of 
self-reliance. Of purity. To show ourselves that we have the 
strength to stand on our own two feet again. Once that is 
assured then nothing like the economic crisis of fifteen years 
ago need ever happen again.&quot;

Prime Minister Fujiwara&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Y-You are serious about 
this... aren&#39;t you...?&quot;

&quot;Of course I am. I always speak my mind about the issues that 
concern me. So be aware. I want you to declare the new law in 
one week. I want this whole country isolated from the rest of 
the world. As do the other three Koga. See to it that our wishes 
are met. And while you think this over; take the time to remind 
yourself of what I can do to you if you refuse me.&quot;

And that last sentence drilled away the remaining scraps of the 
Prime Minister&#39;s resolve. The threat of death. Hirotsugu was 
more than capable himself. Not to mention his feared Mizuryu 
Clan. The shinobi that worked under Hirotsugu were some of the 
most powerful in all of Japan. There was nothing Fujiwara could 
do against a force like that. The PM lowered his head once more 
and solemnly nodded to Hirotsugu. As if he were signing his life 
away. A devious smile of appreciation crossed the Honshu Koga&#39;s 
face once more. It was done. With that said and done; Hirotsugu 
arrogantly walked away, his grey ponytail just about grazing the 
carpeted floor of Fujiwara&#39;s office. He opened the door and 
walked through it; entering surrounding halls of the outside. 
This was the second time that Hirotsugu had come here to the 
Diet Building in this week. But the pressure he had been placing 
on the PM had paid off. He was ready to make the decree. As 
Hirotsugu walked out into the halls of the Diet Building, he 
stopped in stride. His thin lips pulled into another smile. Then 
he cranked his neck back to take a glimpse above.
 
A young man, in his early twenties, stood with both feet pressed 
firmly in the ceiling of the hallway. His rippled and muscled 
upper body was unhindered by clothing. While his waist was 
wrapped with a tight crimson belt which held up his 
multi-coloured dragon-print slacks. He made the two fingered 
sign of the shinobi with his right hand; while his other hand 
stood against his side. He was also armed. Across his back was a 
large glaive with a crescent moon shaped blade. The relentless 
power of his smouldering Chi was so strong it could be smelt as 
vividly as a wafting stink of blood. But while he wielded great 
strength to even the naked eye, the shinobi standing upside down 
on the ceiling gave Hirotsugu a curious glimpse. One that just 
happened to indicate servitude.  

&quot;How did things proceed?&quot; The young man asked, his spiky russet 
hair lulling downwards.

&quot;The plan is ripe, Yagami-kun,&quot; Hirotsugu spoke to him with 
great zeal, &quot;I need you and the other members of the Six Orochi 
to stand on watch of the Diet Building. We cannot risk anything 
happening to Fujiwara-san until he declares the re-use of the 
Closed Country policy.&quot;

&quot;I thought that he was disposable.&quot; Yagami answered. 

&quot;He is,&quot; Hirotsugu turned to look back at the office door, &quot;And 
he seems to have forgotten that. But no matter. He is just a 
puppet in spite of everything. Whether he wishes to accept it or 
not. Once we have want we need from him... you may kill him.&quot;

Yagami nodded with unquestioning loyalty. &quot;As you command, 
Master. I actually came here to inform you of the actions of the 
girl.&quot;

Hirotsugu&#39;s habitually calm black eyes turned far more alert. 
&quot;...So she is in Tokyo now?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yagami nodded, &quot;We lost track of her after she left 
Morioka. But we do know that she has entered Tokyo. And more 
specifically, enrolled in Kimagure Gakuen. Zanmaru-san has been 
sent to take care of her before she serves to cause you anymore 
grief, Hirotsugu-sama.&quot;

Hirotsugu crossed his arms, breathing deeply. &quot;Good. We can have 
no such problems now. My plans must go ahead without fail. Once 
Fujiwara does as I have commanded, it will begin. If things all 
go to plan...  the Fuin no Seishinryoku (Seal of Willpower) will 
soon be broken.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kimagure Gakuen

Yui&#39;s soft emerald orbs could hardly take in what she was 
seeing. The school was so large! A mightily standing 
establishment for education. It was made up of four large 
buildings built into close-knit locations around the site. 
Towards the back of the school were three large parks (two 
grass, one tarmac) built for sports use and recreation. It was a 
co-ed school; and was rated as one of the top twenty high 
schools of Tokyo. Kimagure Gakuen clearly reflected the 
technological climate of the country; with a gigantic science 
and technology department; all the while retaining its sense of 
quaintness and dignity. It had a genuinely friendly feel to it; 
probably supported by the front gardens which were lined with 
cherry blossom trees. The actual grounds were based in a 
suburban area just on the edge of Tokyo. Yui&#39;s apartment was a 
short bus ride away; but this part of the city seemed somehow 
cleaner and more fresh. But not just in spirit. The school 
itself adhered to the aura of the area. There was very little 
litter or rubbish, the streets were far quieter, and fewer cars 
drove up and down the roads that had been interwoven into the 
district.  

Yui slowly walked up to the tall black front gates of the 
school, her book bag in front of her, and her uniform all 
pressed and looking cute. Though she had far more important 
things to worry about then school, Yui was looking forward to 
coming here. It took her mind off other things that she didn&#39;t 
need to stress herself with at this precise moment in time. Yui 
looked around her at all the other students as they chatted and 
marched reservedly into the school via the open front gates. In 
this bright sunny morning everything seemed great. Then Yui took 
a quick glance at the main gate. And gave a curious look at 
someone standing beside it. A youthful schoolgirl; probably the 
same age as Yui herself; seventeen. This girl awkwardly ran a 
hand through her long blonde tresses; alternating glances 
between her wrist watch and the road. 

Yui could imagine who that would be. She had been told that on 
the day she came to the school her class representative would 
wait for her at the front gate. Just to show her the ropes 
beforehand to help the settling in process. The Girl from 
Morioka blushed a little. The class rep was actually a little 
cuter than she would have originally believed. After all, such 
duties in the student body were sort of classed to the &#39;nerd&#39; 
list. But Yui couldn&#39;t just stand there admiring the other girl. 
Her face looked sort of irritated as it was. Best not to keep 
her waiting any longer. The brown haired Yui sped up her walk as 
peacefully as she could make it seem and stopped just ahead of 
the class rep. 

Yui nodded to her for a brief second, trying to ignore her 
blush. &quot;Hajime mashite. Um... I guess you must be waiting for 
me? You&#39;re my class representative, right...?&quot;

&quot;Hajime mashite. Are you Hazumaru Yui?&quot; The girl questioned 
immediately. 

Yui nodded cheerfully to that. Which was where the class rep&#39;s 
facial expression changed from stoic to mildly angered. She 
rested her hands upon her hips in a matriarchal manner, and 
leered over Yui with a disparaging glance. &quot;Well now! It&#39;s about 
time! Do you know that I&#39;ve been waiting for you for over 
fifteen minutes?&quot;

The gentle Yui ran a nervous hand into her bangs. &quot;...Um... 
sorry about that... I had a lot of hassle moving my stuff around 
last night and I didn&#39;t get much sleep because of it. If I&#39;ve 
delayed you in anyway I&#39;ll try and make up for it as best as I 
can.&quot;

After giving Yui one last condescending look, the class rep 
softened a little and eased up from her tense disposition. She 
held out her hand to Yui. &quot;Okay. Don&#39;t worry about it. Lets just 
get started. My name is Uchida Haruko. Nice to meet you.&quot;

Yui clasped Haruko&#39;s hand into her own, shivering a little from 
the softness of her flesh. &quot;Nice to meet you too, Uchida-san. 
Kimagure Gakuen looks like a really great school; I hope I&#39;ll 
like it here.&quot;

The blonde girl, Haruko, nodded and then turned towards the 
gate. &quot;I hope you&#39;ll like it too. I&#39;m sure a couple people will 
badmouth the school to you but I wouldn&#39;t listen to those guys. 
Now. We&#39;ll have to miss the first period so I can show you 
around the school grounds. Come on, quick now.&quot;

Well it wasn&#39;t like she wanted to be left behind. She wasn&#39;t 
expecting anything less. But if Yui weren&#39;t so excited with her 
new school, she would have probably noticed that she was being 
watched. By someone with intentions just a little bit past 
ominous.
