fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Kima lay atop of her bed with her arms spread out to either side and her 
eyes lightly closed as she listened to the bustle of feet in the hallway 
outside her room as the girls rushed about in preparation for school. 
Time slowly ticked by and the sounds began to lessen until finally there 
were only a few drifting murmurs outside of the door. Still she waited a 
moment longer to be certain that another surge of bodies wouldn&#39;t flood 
the corridors once again. She slowly opened her eyes and stared up at 
the ceiling as she counted down the voices beyond her door. 

&quot;Five... four... three...&quot; She got to her feet and picked up her clothes 
off the back of the chair. She hoped that the lack of commotion meant 
that there would be fewer glares when she went to take a shower. She 
planned to lay low for the next while in hopes that maybe her prior 
actions would soon be forgotten.

She touched the doorknob, took a deep breath and bid a silent prey to 
anyone who would listen. When the door opened she was greeted by 
silence, the long hallway was devoid of any presence other then her own. 
Happy her prayers had been answered she quickly headed for the showers, 
not wanting to test her luck anytime soon. She rounded the corner and 
almost collided into her twin, whom was dripping wet and clenching 
tightly to her bathrobe. 

&quot;Kimberly!?!&quot; Kima clutched her chest; as her heart tried to jump from 
her ribcage, &quot;Don&#39;t scare me like that!&quot; She exclaimed. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Kim&#39;s eyes darted around the hall. 

&quot;Are you being hassled by the lovely ladies as well?&quot; Kima asked slyly 
and with a wink, hiding her own worries. 

&quot;N... no...&quot; Kim stammered shyly.

&quot;Oh right.&quot; Kima mused, &quot;You don&#39;t like showering with others in the 
room. Still embarrassed of those scars are we?&quot; 

Kim clung to her bathroom securer around her neck, &quot;Leave me alone.&quot; She 
said firmly. 

Kima rubbed her head and sighed, &quot;We&#39;re not getting anywhere with this. 
Why can&#39;t you stop pushing me away?&quot;

&quot;Because I hate you.&quot; Kim stated angrily, &quot;You&#39;re dirty, hurtful, 
disgusting.&quot;

Kima rolled her eyes, &quot;and you can sound like a broken record at times.&quot; 
Her ears perked up as she heard something drifted down the hallway 
behind her and quickly spun around to face the sound, &quot;Do you hear 
that?&quot; She asked uneasily. 

&quot;Hear what?&quot; Kim moved around her double and strained to hear what she 
was talking about. 

Kima stood motionlessly, her ears twitching at the slighted noise, &quot;This 
way!&quot; She announced then rushed down the corridor. 

Kim glanced around in confusion, &quot;Kima?&quot; She considered leaving her twin 
to her own volition when she turned to see that the lights down the 
hallway behind her were slowly turning off and plunging them into 
eternal darkness. Kim stepped away from the blackness as it seeped 
towards her, &quot;No... No no no...&quot; She mumbled and started to run after 
her twin, &quot;Kiiimmaaa!!!&quot; She called out in fear and found her double 
standing at one of the dorm room doors at the far end of the hall, in a 
corner. 

&quot;Shhh!!&quot; Kima urged with a wave of her hand as she placed her ear 
against the door, &quot;It&#39;s a waltz...&quot; She puzzled then turned to Kim, 
&quot;Wasn&#39;t that waltz from film with the sleeping princess?&quot; 

Kim gave Kima a perplexed look, &quot;Sleeping Beauty?&quot; she returned. 

&quot;Why couldn&#39;t I remember that?&quot; Kima mussed while running a hand across 
her chin. 

&quot;What about i-&quot; Kim suddenly could hear the waltz as well and stared at 
the door curiously, &quot;What is so special about a waltz?&quot; She demanded, 
turning to glance back down the hall to see the lights continuing to 
grow dimmer. 

&quot;I get a strange feeling from this door.&quot; Kima reached out her hand to 
touch the doorknob.

Kim spun around to see her twin was about to open the door and her mind 
filled with images of the toothy mass of darkness that lay beyond her 
bedroom door at home. Suddenly fear took over her mind and she lunged at 
Kima, &quot;NO!!!&quot; She grabbed Kima&#39;s hand in an attempt to stop her, the 
moment that her fingers touched the knob tendrils of darkness quickly 
seeped through the cracks of the door and plunged the girl&#39;s into 
complete darkness.
