<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 28 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>      &quot;Alright,&quot; Mina said, placing a few books on the table. &quot;Me and Seth went to a couple 
of occult stores and found these.&quot;

      Faye grabbed one of the books and flipped through it with Erin looking over her 
shoulder. &quot;Jeez... all this material about one person?&quot;

      Erin frowned. &quot;Me and Faye don&#39;t know that much about the Lord of Demons since he&#39;s a 
human made being, not a god... He&#39;s been around a long time, though.&quot;

      Sakura suddenly spoke up. &quot;As we know, demons are just a different form of humanity - 
those who have given in to dark desires or those who have become one with nature. Demons 
like Bakra and Isaka are descendants of the humans who gave in to darkness and demons that 
affiliate with animals are simply descendants of those in tune with nature.&quot;

      Abby was looking at the pictures in another book. &quot;So the Demon Lord is the leader of 
all demons, but really one of those dark desire demon things?&quot;

      The angel shook her head. &quot;It&#39;s hard to explain, but...&quot;

      Seth finished the thought for her. &quot;He was one of the first demon leaders that began 
interaction with humans and his soul was preserved after he died. Since then, it has been 
passed along to others deemed worthy of containing it. The power of his soul grew with each 
new Lord, who then passed on their powers when they died and so on. Thus, each successive 
Demon Lord is far stronger than the last.&quot;

      Bakra sighed and plopped down on the couch. &quot;We&#39;re so screwed, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

      At that point, Tycara, now almost 15, came down the stairs, a solemn look on her face. 
&quot;Isaka is still unconscious... her wounds are healing up alright, but I don&#39;t think we can 
find out what happened inside that room for a while.&quot;

      There was a moment of silence. Then, a scream rang out that soon dissolved into a 
whimper. Abby sat up, a shocked look on her face. It was then that she realized she 
shouldn&#39;t have told Eveon to keep an eye on Carmilla... but she&#39;d been tired after fighting 
with Tycara and she&#39;d been lying on the couch when Eveon asked if she needed help. She just 
had a memory lapse... about the fact that her daughter was in a room with a dangerous 
person.

      Mina recognized the scream instantly. &quot;Eveon!&quot; She took off up the stairs, to the 
guest bedrooms. Bakra scrambled after her as well, worried about the girl&#39;s safety. Everyone 
else gave Abby a look.

      &quot;I know - I&#39;m a terrible mother, but I was tired! I wasn&#39;t thinking straight!&quot;

      &quot;Well, we all know you can&#39;t think straight anymore-&quot; Faye&#39;s joke was cut off when 
Erin bopped her on the head.

      Sakura got up. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Abby. I&#39;ll go see if she&#39;s alright.&quot;

      When the angel finally made it to the room, she was treated to an interesting sight. 
Eveon had been pulled into the bed by Carmilla and was currently struggling to get the 
vampire off of her. Bakra had grabbed the woman around the waist and was attempting to 
disengage Carmilla&#39;s fangs from Eveon&#39;s neck. Mina was desperately pulling the blonde girl 
away from the vampire, shouting different phrases and sentences about how Eveon belonged to 
her and no magical creature was going to molest her girlfriend.

      Bakra pulled on Carmilla&#39;s hair, causing her head to jerk up. Some blood dripped from 
her mouth and from Eveon&#39;s wound. Unfortunately, the vampire was not giving up without a 
fight as she held on to Eveon and tried to sink her teeth back in.

      &quot;Let me go! I&#39;m so hungry and she&#39;s such a delicious girl!&quot;

      &quot;Like Hell! Get a hold of yourself, Carmilla!&quot; Bakra was barely keeping her away from 
the still trapped Eveon.

      &quot;How dare you do this to me girlfriend! You can&#39;t have Eveon,&quot; Mina shouted out, 
trying to keep the vampire from devouring her poor little Eveon.

      As Sakura went over to help, the crisis was averted when Bakra put his hand in 
Carmilla&#39;s mouth, causing the vampire to bite him. As soon as his blood entered her mouth, 
she recoiled and let Eveon go. Mina quickly pulled her into a hug, examining the tired 
girl&#39;s bite wound.

      &quot;Gah!&quot; Carmilla yelled, wiping her mouth with her hands. &quot;Nasty boy demon blood! 
That&#39;s not what I want!&quot; She looked behind her to see Eveon getting a hold of herself. The 
blonde became frightened as those red eyes zeroed in on her. &quot;I want... fresh virgin girl 
blood!&quot;

      Just when she was about to pounce for a second time, Bakra caught her in a head lock. 
&quot;I understand you&#39;ve been trapped and abused by the crazy sisters from Hell, but now is not 
the time to attack poor, innocent girls!&quot;

      &quot;B-b-but! You don&#39;t understand! I&#39;ve been malnourished this whole time and my powers 
used against my will... then I wake up with an inviting young girl next to me... how can I 
not eat her?!&quot;

      Bakra let out a long sigh and Sakura kneeled down to help out Eveon. &quot;Are you 
alright?&quot;

      Eveon let out a shaky breath. &quot;Yeah... I&#39;m just really tired.&quot;

      With that, the angel helped her up and Eveon looked away from Mina, because her 
girlfriend wasn&#39;t happy about her being so close to Sakura. The white haired woman began to 
heal up Eveon&#39;s neck wound as Mina turned towards the still struggling vampire.

      &quot;What does she mean by malnourished?&quot; The ebony haired girl asked Bakra.

      &quot;I bet those girls didn&#39;t feed her the right kind of blood she liked or a lot of it. 
The weaker they kept her, the easier it would be to control her with that collar. Plus, I 
doubt they would have wanted to attract attention by kidnapping girls for her.&quot;

      Mina let out a sigh and kneeled on the bed. &quot;Carmilla, right?&quot; The vampire nodded as 
much as she could under Bakra&#39;s grip. &quot;I&#39;ll... let you drink some of mine too, if you leave 
Eveon alone.&quot;

      Carmilla eagerly jolted forward. &quot;Really?! You would?&quot;

      Bakra gave the girl a small smile. &quot;Well aren&#39;t we feeling chivalrous today?&quot; He let 
the vampire go and in an instant, she pounced on the younger girl.

      Eveon watched the whole display, uncomfortable. Carmilla had shoved Mina down on the 
bed before biting into her neck. &quot;Is that... all really necessary?&quot; she murmured to herself, 
now understanding why her girlfriend had flipped out... besides the blood sucking thing.

      Carmilla had taken one gulp when she suddenly pulled away, wiping her mouth. She had a 
rather disappointed look on her face. &quot;Hmm... you taste pretty good... but she&#39;s a lot 
better,&quot; the vampire said with a grin, pointing to Eveon. The blonde girl immediately hid 
behind Sakura.

      &quot;What? You said you&#39;re malnourished and I give you some of my virgin blood and you&#39;re 
complaining?&quot; Mina asked, perplexed. She put a hand on the bite marks on her neck. &quot;...this 
is kind of embarrassing.&quot;

      Carmilla got off and started to go over to Eveon until Bakra caught her again. &quot;Nice 
try,&quot; he said. &quot;The bar is closed, but how about we go downstairs and have a talk?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;So, when I had finally caught wind of where Tsuru was, those girls came out of 
nowhere and ambushed me,&quot; Carmilla said, stirring her tea. Everyone was intent on listening 
to what had happened to her, though Eveon made a point to stay cradled between Sakura and 
Mina. The vampire was still shooting her looks... &quot;I didn&#39;t expect the three of them to 
attack at the same time so they took me out and then kept me captive and... all they would 
feed me was dead animal blood, from steaks and stuff,&quot; the vampire whined out, looking over 
at Eveon again.

      Abby rolled her eyes. &quot;We&#39;re not letting you eat Eveon, no matter how badly you were 
treated.&quot;

      Carmilla pursed her lips in annoyance and drank her tea. &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to 
kill her. And if I did, I would just turn her into a vampire so she&#39;d still be alive.&quot;

      Eveon held on tighter to Mina. &quot;Please don&#39;t leave me alone.&quot;

      Erin cleared her throat awkwardly and asked, &quot;Is Isaka still asleep?&quot;

      Tycara got up and went over to the stairs. &quot;I&#39;ll go check up on her.&quot;

      Faye stretched and let out a sigh before wrapping her arm around Erin&#39;s shoulders. 
&quot;How about we leave this studying stuff to everyone else?&quot; She gave her lover a look and 
Erin smiled. They got up and left.

      &quot;Goodness, don&#39;t they realize that I have to wash the sheets when they decided to do 
that?&quot; Abby asked, leaning against Sakura. Of course Erin and Faye would be the only couple 
bashful enough to screw each other with a powerful demon lurking around, Krystal and Tsuru 
missing and Isaka licking her wounds.

      Bakra suddenly interrupted. &quot;I was reading this book and... uh... it seems the Demon 
Lord is divided into three parts?&quot; He frowned and flipped through the pages again. &quot;Or 
something like that.&quot;

      Seth peered over his shoulder. &quot;Yeah, I saw that too. The three parts are the body, 
the soul and the heart. The soul is the basic part of the Demon Lord, which is what those 
three sisters intended to release.&quot;

      &quot;But wouldn&#39;t body make more sense? I mean, whatever got Tsuru and Krystal had to have 
been a body of a person,&quot; Eveon asked.

      Seth shook his head. &quot;Nah, the body is referred to as a physical representation of 
power. The soul is the actual Demon Lord...&quot;

      Carmilla chose that time to pipe up. &quot;Seth&#39;s right. I was mostly in a daze for a good 
portion of my imprisonment, but I heard them talking about the three parts. The soul is what 
enters the vessel, the body is something the new Lord of Demons can obtain and I believe the 
heart is... I&#39;m not really sure. The heart is supposed to be another key to ultimate power.&quot; 
The vampire paused and took a sip of tea.

      Abby sighed. &quot;We&#39;re all doomed, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

      &quot;Me and Bakra can finish up the research if you guys want some food and rest,&quot; Seth 
said, sitting next to the demon. Bakra, of course, had no qualms with the closeness.

      All the females exchanged looks. &quot;My,&quot; Carmilla murmured. &quot;You&#39;re Tycara&#39;s boyfriend, 
right?&quot; Seth nodded and the vampire let out a little giggle before switching her attention 
to someone else.

      &quot;Eveon, do you want to go get something to eat in the kitchen?&quot;

      The blonde girl shook her head. &quot;No, no thank you. I&#39;m sure me and Mina can get it 
just fine!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...Isaka?&quot; The sobbing was still pretty loud as the figure beneath the covers 
shuddered with every outburst.

      Tycara anxiously closed the door before walking over to the bed ad sitting down. All 
of Isaka&#39;s wounds had been treated, so she wasn&#39;t in danger of dying, but... &quot;It&#39;s okay to 
cry,&quot; Tycara murmured. &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;

      Isaka shook her, head her back facing Tycara. The 14 year old sighed and reached over 
to smooth out the demon&#39;s hair. &quot;Whatever it is, I&#39;m sure it will be fine.&quot;

      &quot;No, no it won&#39;t,&quot; Isaka choked out. &quot;Tsuru... she... Tsuru...&quot; She just trailed off, 
burying her face in the pillow. &quot;Krystal, I want Krystal, but she&#39;s not here anymore!&quot;

      Tycara tried to give her a hug, but the demon pushed her away. &quot;Please, just please... 
I want Krystal, please...!&quot;

      Tycara sat there for a few more minutes as her big sister figure continued to cry. 
After a few minutes, she asked, &quot;Do you want to go downstairs? If you tell us what happened, 
we can help you.&quot;

      Isaka just buried herself further in covers. &quot;It hurts so bad...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;You don&#39;t want to eat dinner with me?&quot; Krystal entertained making a witty, clich&Atilde;&copy; 
comeback, but she just shook her head.

      Tsuru frowned, saddened by the news. &quot;I see... if not the dining room, do you want to 
eat in here?&quot; Krystal shook her head again. The blonde was sitting on the bed, her knees 
drawn to her chest. She&#39;d long changed into a different dress, but was now focused on the 
woman standing in the doorway.

      &quot;...do you just not want to eat with me?&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru, please, I&#39;m not hungry.&quot; Her protest didn&#39;t fool the Demon Lord.

      &quot;You haven&#39;t eaten anything since I&#39;ve brought you here... what&#39;s your favorite food? 
I can cook it for you.&quot;

      Krystal laid her head against her knees, obscuring her face from view. &quot;...Tsuru, I 
want to see Isaka.&quot;

      The ebony haired woman frowned. &quot;You only think you do. If we were to spend time 
together instead of you being stubborn, I&#39;m sure your depressing mood would pass.&quot;

      Krystal didn&#39;t say anything and after a long period of silence, Tsuru left the room. 
She hadn&#39;t expected the exorcist to be so... depressed. She supposed it was better than 
having Krystal lash out, but still! The Lord of Demons walked down the hallway of her 
current residence - one of the many castles spread throughout the world.

      She finally came to Hoshi&#39;s room and opened the door without a second thought. Tsuru 
froze upon what she discovered, but merely stepped into the room before closing the door. 
She could hear small coos and whimpers, not from the younger sisters, but from Hoshi. The 
silver haired woman either didn&#39;t notice Tsuru come in, or she just didn&#39;t care.

      With her robes completely open and her pants pooled at the base of the bed, Hoshi was 
too caught up with Hina teasing her breasts and Tsuki kissing her most sensitive spot. 
Eventually, she opened her eyes and turned her head towards Tsuru.

      &quot;Oh... master,&quot; she said, out of breath as her sisters continued. &quot;Tsuki... Tsuki&#39;s 
all healed... so I&#39;m just, just...&quot; A spasm rocked her, so she shut her eyes again and let 
out a perverse sound.

      The dull look in both of the younger sisters&#39; eyes wasn&#39;t lost on Tsuru. A small smile 
graced the Demon Lord&#39;s face. &quot;Good job, Hoshi... you&#39;ve been keeping your sisters under 
control.&quot;

      Hoshi&#39;s only reply was a sharp scream from finally getting a release from her sisters. 
With that, she sat up, gave Hina a light kiss and pulled Tsuki up from in between her legs. 
As she busied herself with tidying up the mess on Tsuki&#39;s mouth, Tsuru spoke.

      &quot;I need your assistance to get my weapon.&quot;

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Hoshi murmured with a grin. She got off the bed, unabashed at her nudity. 
She tugged at the front of her robe, but it did little to cover anything. &quot;Just give me the 
word.&quot;

      &quot;Soon,&quot; Tsuru said, watching as Tsuki drew Hina into a hug. The two sisters still on 
the bed were now engaging in some perverse activities of their own. &quot;I want to get it by the 
end of this day...&quot; It was still early morning.

      Hoshi followed her gaze and looked at her sisters. They were currently kissing each 
other in an almost mechanical fashion. &quot;I love having that effect on them,&quot; she said with a 
laugh. The silver haired woman suddenly leaned on Tsuru&#39;s shoulder. &quot;But you, master, 
haven&#39;t been getting the attention you deserve. Would you like us to...?&quot;

      Tsuru let out a sigh. &quot;No, Hoshi - I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t do that.&quot;

      Hoshi just laughed again, before heading back over to her sisters, the robe sliding 
down one of her shoulders. &quot;I understand. You want to be with Krystal... right? As your 
servants, we just want you to feel good...&quot;

      Tsuru gave her a small smile as she started to exit the room. &quot;But I&#39;m going to have 
Krystal... I doubt she&#39;d want me sleeping around with other girls. I&#39;m not Isaka.&quot;

      She left with a laugh as Hoshi crawled back onto the bed. &quot;Tsuki, Hina,&quot; she purred 
out. &quot;Why don&#39;t you let big sister in on the fun?&quot;
