<a href="../original/testfire-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Cole blinked as she looked at her contact, the black
haired catgirl trying not to show her surprise.
&quot;Davidson hired Jack Scott?&quot; the black haired catgirl
asked.

Ryo nodded, his red hair contrasting his Asian looks.
&quot;That&#39;s the rumor,&quot; he agreed as he sat with her in
the cafe, the morning light shining in through the
handblown windows. Steaming coffee sat I front of him
while steamed milk waited for Cole. &quot;There was a shot
taken at Motoko, a friend of Davidson, but nobody
seems to know who did it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve bee to the Nightingale to hear her perform,&quot;
Cole mused, &quot;she&#39;s good.&quot; She looked at Ryo, &quot;And the
Shogun&#39;s reaction?&quot;

&quot;He doesn&#39;t officially know,&quot; Ryo answered, &quot;I think
he&#39;s letting Davidson run with it first.&quot;

&quot;Makes me wonder if the Wolf or Professor are
involved?&quot; Cole mused. She looked at him thoughtfully,
&quot;What&#39;s the odds in the betting pools?&quot;

&quot;They favor the Professor,&quot; Ryo answered promptly, &quot;
if only &#39;cause the Wolf is strengthening her position
out in Denman street right now.&quot; A half shrug, &quot;Of
course we don&#39;t know if her lover Rose could have
pulled something on her own.&quot;

&quot;Rose is a wild card,&quot; Cole admitted. She put a gold
mark on the table as she finished her drink, &quot;Keep on
watching Scott for me, Ryo.&quot;

Ryo bit the coin to check then slid it into his
pocket, &quot;Of course, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&#39;He doesn&#39;t trust me any more than I do him,&#39; Cole
mused as she strode out onto the street, her dress
short and slinky. With her coat of fur clothes were
only for modesty&#39;s sake, and she had never been
terribly modest. &#39;Still, his information was usually
good,&#39; she admitted.

Walking up towards the Bay building Cole nodded to
familiar faces, observing the passers by. Some looked
entirely human, some almost inhumanly transformed, and
the majority carried within them some secret gift. It
was because of those gifts that humanity had survived
the long darkness after the meteor strike, and it was
those gifts that now made the world such a complicated
place.

One of the guards nodded respectfully as he opened the
door, &quot;Ms Cole.&quot;

&quot;Mac,&quot; Cole smiled up at him. Seriously she continued,
&quot;Put the word out that the troops need to be more
alert, there may be trouble from the Shogun or
Professor.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Mac nodded.

Cole headed upstairs to Bannon&#39;s office, grimacing at
all the stairs. She reached the door and knocked
lightly, &quot;Sir?&quot;

&quot;Come in,&quot; Bannon called. The brown haired man nodded
as she came in, his eyes intent as he asked, &quot;What did
you mean, trouble from the Shogun or Professor?&quot;

&quot;I only told Mac a few minutes ago,&quot; Cole sauntered
inside, &quot;I still don&#39;t believe how fast information
gets back to you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a gift,&quot; Bannon said dryly. &quot;So?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s bee an indirect attack on one of the Shogun&#39;s
lieutenants,&quot; Cole explained, &quot;Davidson&#39;s lover and/or
girlfriend Motoko was assaulted.&quot;

Bannon quickly added it up, &quot;You think it might be
part of some larger scheme of the Professor&#39;s or that
the Shogun might suspect we&#39;re behind it.&quot;

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Cole agreed as she sat down. She gave him a
thoughtful look, &quot;I know I didn&#39;t order anything like
this...?&quot;

&quot;Nor did I,&quot; Bannon said to her coldly. &quot;It&#39;s far too
clumsy a move and likely to backfire,&quot; he said with a
sigh.

Cole acknowledged the rebuke silently. After a moment
she continued, &quot;It seems out of character for the
Professor, he&#39;s usually more elegant.&quot;

&quot;Not to mention starting a two front war for him,&quot;
Bannon sighed as he ran a hand through his thinning
hair. &quot;What is that idiot thinking of?&quot;

&quot;It could be he&#39;s hoping to get us in a two front
war,&quot; Cole offered.

&quot;Eh?&quot; Bannon blinked.

&quot;By threatening Davidson the Professor might be hoping
to start something between us and the Shogun,&quot; Cole
explained. &quot;With our forces split between both borders
it might give him the chance to make that territorial
grab he&#39;s been hoping for.&quot;

&quot;That bastard,&quot; Bannon murmured. He closed his eyes a
moment then asked, &quot;What is the Shogun doing about
it?&quot;

&quot;Officially nothing,&quot; Cole answered promptly,
&quot;Davidson hasn&#39;t brought it to his attention, instead
he&#39;s handling it privately.&quot;

It took Bannon only a second to come up with the name,
&quot;He&#39;s called in Jack Scott?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Cole nodded, &quot;she&#39;s guarding the girl while
Davidson takes steps.&quot;

&quot;Normally I&#39;d be happy to see a conflict between
Professor and the Shogun, but this has too much
potential to splash on us,&quot; Bannon worried.

&quot;What do you want to do?&quot; Cole asked, knowing from the
look on his face that the Mayor had something in mind.

&quot;Contact Jack Scott,&quot; he said firmly, &quot;offer her help,
but discretely.&quot; Bannon smiled at her quizzical look,
&quot;It helps show we&#39;re innocent, as well as maybe
getting on Scott&#39;s good side, after our men tried to
put the muscle on her.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Cole rose with feline grace, her smile
impish. She looked at him curiously, &quot;Should I try
to...?&quot;

&quot;I suspect Scott will be largely immune to your
charms,&quot; Bannon said dryly as he watched her leave,
&quot;but you&#39;re welcome to try.&quot;

&quot;Those are the ones that are the most fun,&quot; Cole
laughed as she closed the door behind her.

Cole had a spring to her step as she descended the
stairs, exiting the building on the Georgia side. She
headed towards Granville street, the busy commercial
heart of Bannon&#39;s territory then waved down a cycle
driven carriage.

&quot;Where to, miss?&quot; the young man at the pedals asked
cheerfully, his slightly angular appearance almost
making him look foxlike.

&quot;The Woodwards building on Hastings,&quot; Cole said as she
climbed in and passed him a gold half-mark, &quot;you don&#39;t
have to rush.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; he grinned, pocketing the coin and heading
off.

They coasted downhill on Granville street, past the
Pacific Center Mall and towards the waterfront before
taking a right turn onto Hastings. They bounced along
the cracked road, the cyclist careful not to tend too
near the Harbor Center tower. Once a public building
and tourist trap it had been taken over by the
Sisterhood, a rabid separatist cult.

&quot;Has there been any trouble lately?&quot; Cole asked,
noticing his tense shoulders.

&quot;They&#39;ve been taking pot shots at passerby again,&quot; the
driver explained.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Cole muttered. Bannon had tried to root them
out once before but the Sisterhood was too dug in and
well armed, and their people had taken bad losses.
Still, it was beginning to look like it might be time
to take another shot at it.

They traveled on a block or two, then the driver
announced with some relief, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Cole said as she gracefully climbed down,
giving the boy a charming smile.

&quot;Do you want me to wait here for you?&quot; he asked Cole,
warily watching the neighborhood around them.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ll be,&quot; Cole said gently,
&quot;maybe next time.&quot; With a sway to her hips she walked
up to the building, knowing that the boy was watching
her hungrily. &#39;Now if only Jack Scott is as easy to
handily,&#39; she thought.

&quot;Bannon&#39;s people aren&#39;t welcome here,&quot; the older man
at the desk growled, his long brown hair tied back and
a few lines creasing his face.

&quot;I&#39;m here to see a resident,&quot; Cole said, feeling a
flash of annoyance, &quot;not to start any trouble.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; he puffed out a breath but grudgingly waved
her towards the stairs.

&#39;Long memory, considering it&#39;s been a few years since
we tried to take this place from the Shogun,&#39; Cole
noted. Jack Scott had played a major role then, too,
helping the defenders here stop Bannon&#39;s people cold.
&#39;Hope that isn&#39;t a hint of what&#39;s to come,&#39; Cole
thought as she reached the right floor. Walking up the
hall she found the door, smiling as she saw the
frosted glass reading &#39;Jack Scott, Investigations,
Negotiations, Problem Resolution.&#39;

&quot;Yes?&quot; the voice called before Cole could even knock.

&quot;My name is Cole,&quot; she said as she turned the door
handle and went inside, &quot;and I hope to be of
assistance to you, Miss Scott.&quot;</pre>
