Prologue - Opened

Philadelphia, Pa United States 2009 July 6th (5:14 P.M.)

Titus woke up from the jerk of the bus and the jingle of his 
chains.  He then remembered where he was.  It wasn&#39;t his mother&#39;s 
house in his dream; Titus was on a prison transfer bus on the way to 
his last stop before he was put down.  He was sentenced to death for 
the murder of over 70 some men.

Of course Titus had his reasons, but no matter what most people 
believed he still had no right to do what he did.  Even the ones who 
backed him up were edgy about it.  Titus was one of those people who 
lost everything he loved and felt only right to punish the evil just 
like a vigilante you would see in a comic.  Except there was no happy 
ending, no heroics, and Titus was most definitely human.  He had 
plenty of scars from his exploits.

A slight dizziness passed over Titus.  He figured it was 
probably the same thing that had put him in a coma for a week last 
month.  Since then he&#39;s had double vision as guards and other inmates 
walked by his cell.  What was weird about it though was he would 
always see the blurred version a second before the actual person came 
by.  It made no sense but it didn&#39;t matter anymore.  He was a dead man 
in 2 weeks.

Titus decided to just look up and watch the road for a while.  
It was soothing for a while until he saw a semi drive across the 
median and crash right into the bus.  Titus closed his eyes in fear 
but nothing happened; the bus still hummed down the highway.  Two 
seconds after he closed his eyes he opened them and this time a semi 
really did ram into the bus.

As the bus turned and tumbled Titus watched in horror as a 
glowing green rod shot through his stomach.  He jerked around in the 
tumbling bus as the rod disappeared leaving him unharmed.  Because of 
his tossing he fell to the floor and watched as a rod pierced the seat 
above him where he would have been.  The rod was the exact same as the 
green one, except it wasn&#39;t green or glowing AND IT WAS REAL!

The bus finally stopped moving.  As the smoke started to clear 
Titus saw his escape.

********

Tokyo, Japan July 6th (3:16 A.M.)

Karen shot straight up stiff as a board and grasped her pounding 
heart.  She could fell it pounding on her hand, trying to escape her 
terrified body.  As her heart slowed down her body loosened up and she 
fell back down on her bed.  Karen gulped in air as her lungs started 
to work again.  Her body was covered in cold sweat to the point that 
the bed sheets were soaked.

All of a sudden she realized it wasn&#39;t all sweat that was making 
her bed wet.  She was looking at her left hand and it was covered in 
blood.  When Karen brought up her right hand to wipe away the blood it 
too was covered in blood.  She quickly ran to the bathroom and turned 
on the water, spreading her blood all over the sink.  The clear liquid 
washed away the red and revealed the wounds.

Karen started to cry hysterically and within seconds her mother 
was in there with her.  &quot;What&#39;s the matter honey, why are yo... Good 
God, where&#39;d all the blood come from?&quot;

Karen raised her hands to show her mother that her hands had 
reopened, that the stigmata had returned.  This was the last thing 
Karen wanted to deal with.  The first time it happened she was under 
constant questioning from press, priests, skeptics, and her friends.

It was her father&#39;s fault really.  He was the one who went to 
everyone telling them about it.  For up to two years after it happened 
people would go as far as stop in the street bow and kiss her hand and 
asked to be blessed, or anyone who believed she did it to herself for 
fame would yell profanity at her and flip her off.

What was worse was the fact the dream she had seemed too real 
and vivid.  Something told her life was never ever going to be simple 
from now on.




Chapter 1 (Karen) The Bleeding Girl

Karen saw Kumi waving to her as she neared Tomeishuu High.  She 
quickly swung her hands behind her back and looked away.  Kumi was 
Karen&#39;s best friend but she still was embarrassed about the stigmata.

&quot;Hey.  What&#39;s got you so down?&quot;  Kumi asked as she raced up to 
Karen.  &quot;Was vacation really that bad with your family.&quot;

&quot;No, nothing like that.&quot;

&quot;Then what&#39;s eating you?  I bet its a romantic problem, like you 
love someone but they don&#39;t love you back.&quot;  Kumi teased.

Karen took Kumi by the hand quickly and looked into her eyes.  
They stood frozen for a few seconds before Kumi pulled her hand away.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me...&quot; Kumi stuttered.  &quot;You&#39;ve been secretly in 
love with me all these years?&quot;

&quot;YOU&#39;RE TOO DAMN MELO DRAMATIC KUMI!  I wanted you to look at my 
hand nit-wit.&quot;  Karen raised her hand to Kumi palm forward.  &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe you thought I was in love with you.  Besides you know I can&#39;t 
keep any secretes from you.  If I was like that you&#39;d know.&quot;

&quot;Karen... Your Stigmata reopened.&quot;

&quot;No, I did a hand stand on a picket fence.  Of course it 
reopened.&quot;

&quot;Did you have a dream like last time it happened?&quot;  Kumi asked 
as they started walking again.

&quot;Yeah but it was really different this time.&quot;

&quot;Remind me what the first one was about again.&quot;

Karen sighed out of frustration.  It seemed like every year she 
had to remind Kumi.  She wasn&#39;t so angry about it though because no 
one had asked her about it for awhile now, but that would probably 
change now.

&quot;It was when we were seven, do you remember that?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, ten years ago.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, the first time it happened was during the day at a 
restaurant.&quot;

&quot;I know that Karen, just tell me about the dream.&quot;

&quot;Ok, ok.  I was older, maybe in my twenties.  I&#39;m in a park 
during twilight and there&#39;s this demonic figure standing about 30 
meters in front of me.  The creature then throws a evil looking knife 
or blade and I jump in front of it.  The knife goes in my gut and I 
collapse on the ground.  I&#39;m looking up at the sky as I see a woman 
with blue hair lean over me and grabs hold of me around the shoulders.  
She then says &#39;Don&#39;t die on me please!  I love you too much for this 
to happen.  I&#39;m sorry...&#39; then the next thing I know I&#39;m in a 
hospital.  End of dream.  Why do you always ask me?&quot;

&quot;Karen you know me.  I analyze every thing.  I guess I&#39;m trying 
to figure out what it means and how it is related to your stigmata.  
Was your new dream similar?&quot;

&quot;How do you mean similar?  If your talking about hauntingly 
realistic, yes.  What happened in it seemed to have no relevance with 
the last one.&quot;

Before they knew it Karen and Kumi were already in their 
classroom.  Kumi asked Karen to wait till lunch to tell her anymore.  
Her grades were slipping and she needed to get them back up if she was 
going to be aloud to go to America on the foreign exchange program.

The morning went by pretty quickly for Karen.  She thought it 
was going to be horrible with a ton of questions about her hands.  The 
only ones she did get were if they hurt or not.  No one asked her why 
she had gauze on hands, knowing full well why.

Finally came lunch time.  Karen and Kumi sat under the same tree 
they do every day.  The first thing Kumi said was &quot;Hey, your hand is 
bleeding.&quot;

Karen looked down at her left hand and noticed that the blood 
had soaked through the top of bandage.  She searched through her bag 
and pulled out another gauze wrap and held it to Kumi.

&quot;Whaf?&quot;  Kumi asked as she took a bite out of her rice ball.

&quot;Would you please wrap my hand?&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t you do it?&quot;

&quot;My right hand has a hole in it the size of a large spike.&quot;  
Karen responded sarcastically.  &quot;It hurts to the point breathing hurts 
it.  Please just do it.&quot;

Kumi put down her food and started to unwrap the old bandage.  
&quot;So what was the new dream about?&quot;

Karen breathed in and went right to it.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t me in this 
one.  I was this guy on some bus.  It was full of bars and the man was 
chained.  I think it was a prison bus, I can&#39;t be sure.  Anyway the 
bus got ran into and the bus started to roll on its side.  As a result 
this bar was dislodged and was supposed to go through the guys body, 
but he saw it happen before it really happened and narrowly avoided 
it.  After the smoke cleared he got up and escaped off of the bus.  
That&#39;s it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s you in a past life.&quot;  Kumi suggested as she finished 
wrapping Karen&#39;s hand.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so.  It was different, like I knew everything 
that was happening.  The time, the day, I even knew the guy&#39;s name and 
his thoughts.&quot;

Kumi picked up her rice ball and finished it off. &quot;Sho whaf wath 
the day and whaft wath hisf knam?&quot; (So what was the day and what was 
his name?&quot;

&quot;Well it happened yesterday evening and his name was Titus D. 
Hope.&quot;

Kumi dropped her sandwich right in the dirt.  She knew the name 
Karen said too well.  Karen looked over at Kumi who was staring 
blankly down at the ground.

&quot;Oh get over it.  You can have my food, I&#39;m not really hungry 
today.&quot;

&quot;Are you lying to me Karen!&quot;  Kumi said as she grabbed her 
friend by the shoulders.

&quot;No!  Have you lost your mind?&quot;

&quot;You mean to tell me you never have heard that name before you 
had that dream?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;  Karen responded confused as hell.  &quot;Why, do you know 
something about this guy?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, only everything.&quot;  Kumi said as she let go of Karen and 
fell back up against the tree.  She understood how Karen could be 
confused.  Kumi herself would have never even heard about Hope if she 
weren&#39;t going to go to America.

&quot;Well spill it.&quot;

&quot;I researched the guy when I was learning current events in 
America, to get myself ready for the trip.  He&#39;s a convict, a killer, 
and a saint.  He was a author and made a ton a money on a trilogy and 
two other stand alone novels.  He made a killing on movie rights as 
well.  Hope then invested on realastate increasing his earnings even 
more.  Next he started his own video and music stores, but not before 
becoming a record producer.  He had a quick rising empire and more 
money than he knew what to do with.  So he started to donate to 
charity big time.  Not just money to organizations, but he actually 
set up his own programs.  Hope himself went to other countries and 
personally helped build houses, shelters, and give out food and 
medicine.  He practically owns some of the poorest countries in the 
world, except they are not poor anymore thanks to him.

&quot;One day he gets a letter stating that the pope himself would 
like to meet Titus in person.  So he flies his family and himself out 
to the Vatican.  While Hope was visiting with the Pope his daughter 
and wife went to visit one of the churches.  It turns out while 
praying a bolt on a giant cross in the church they were in, was 
defaulty and snapped.  The cross swung down and literally liquefied 
his family across the stain glass windows.&quot;

Karen held her hands up to her mouth in shock.  Kumi saw this 
but decided to continue.

&quot;You probably already know with most incidents like this, the 
person can either find acceptance, or become bitter.&quot;

Karen did know what she meant.  Karen had become very bitter 
after the first time she got the stigmata.  Unfortunately she has yet 
to seen the acceptance side of someone after a tragedy.

&quot;Hope became very bitter and denounced God.  He declared in his 
final book that he decided that it would be easier to get rid of evil 
in the world by killing all the ones who caused it.  Hope said he 
would sacrifice his soul, God or no God because he wouldn&#39;t want to be 
near anything that vile.  Hope then proceeded to act out as a 
vigilante and killed any one who killed others, raped others, beat or 
harassed others in a horrible way, and anyone who cheated on their 
significant other.  Of course incase your wondering that book I talked 
about a minute ago was published after the police figured out who it 
was and arrested him.

&quot;That was a very stupid thing of him to do, because he was going 
to get off.  They didn&#39;t have enough evidence to win a trial, only 
enough to get him into one.  The book condemned him and he was given 
the death penalty.&quot;

Karen was stunned.  For some reason she got the feeling that she 
lived this out.  The dream seemed to come back to her again and she 
saw flashes of Titus&#39;s past memories.  Luckily it stopped as quickly 
as it started.

&quot;Maybe I should tell someone this time after all.&quot;  Karen 
whispered.

&quot;In the meantime I need to cheer you up.&quot;  Kumi exclaimed as she 
stood up.  &quot;Come on, our next class is ancient history.  You always 
love it, so lets go.&quot;  Kumi grabbed Karen by the forearm and helped 
her up.

As they headed back into the school Karen realized that neither 
her nor Kumi really got to eat.  Karen always did feel bad about 
wasting food and she couldn&#39;t save it for later.  It would be unsafe 
to eat it once school was over so she was forced to throw it out.

The class went as usual, but today was different.  They started 
their section on ancient Egyptian mythology.  Both Karen and Kumi 
loved learning all they could about ancient Egypt.  Kumi raised her 
hand when Mrs. Ijaiko asked which Egyptian God was the highest deity, 
but was to slow as Karen actually stood up to answer.

&quot;Some ones excited?&quot;  Mrs. Ijaiko said with a smirk.  &quot;Ok miss 
Kim give us the answer.  Uh, miss Kim... Are you ok?&quot;

Karen made no reply and just stared at the ceiling as her eyes 
started to dilate.  She then started to seizure and collapsed to the 
floor.  This shocked the entire classroom.

&quot;Karen!&quot;  Kumi yelled as she rushed over to her friend.

Kumi turned her over and there was blood all across her head.  
Kumi knew she probably hit her head pretty hard when she fell, but it 
would have only hurt the one side.  Karen had cuts all across her 
head.

Karen couldn&#39;t see anything while this happened but she could 
still hear everyone.  The last thing she heard before she blacked out 
completely was &quot;Call for help!&quot;

********

Karen opened her eyes and found her self-looking up at the open 
blue sky.  She quickly sat up and looked around.  Flat and endless 
grassland surrounded her.  There was nothing in sight except for 
grass.

Karen stood up and turned around.  She nearly fell back down.  A 
very tall man in a gray suit was standing behind her.

All of a sudden wings spread out from behind him and he said, 
&quot;You may be wondering what is going on.  You have been chosen to 
complete a mission for God.&quot;

&quot;Whaa... What?  God... Why?&quot;

&quot;It is simple my dear girl.  You are a Scion.&quot;
