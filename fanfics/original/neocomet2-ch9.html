~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;...Damn...!&quot;

Saizaki struggled to roll onto his back. Things were so up in the air. 
One minute he was battling Diana, the next Lilia was pelting her with 
some golden sphere thing. It was all so overwhelming. But first things 
first, he had to get on his feet and see how the girl was doing. Saizaki 
struggled up onto weak knees. That shot from Diana had not only bruised 
his ribs,  but also tired him out. There was hardly any energy left in 
his tank. But the boy still managed to get his bearings. Saizaki reached 
for the Fire Cutter as soon as he stood up, sheathed it, then went to 
Lilia&#39;s side. With urgent hands, Saizaki rolled the girl gently over to 
her back. Lilia&#39;s body came over easily. 

&quot;Lilia...&quot; Saizaki said desperately. &quot;Are you alright? Lilia?&quot;

It was no good. She was out cold. But Saizaki thanked the lucky stars 
that she was still breathing. Hopefully she would wake up soon. As 
Saizaki tried to make things more comfortable for the sleeping woman, 
the Neo-German Captain, Rainhande was walking up to the two of them. He 
had managed to awaken during the noise that had been created by that 
Charade Sphere attack. He had woken up and seen Lilia force Diana away. 
With magic. Rainhande cast an emotionless glare at the sleeping girl and 
the boy who was next to her. Saizaki was so consumed with Lilia&#39;s 
welfare that he had not noticed that Rainhande was awake. Or the 
unreadable glares he was casting at Lilia. To a point.

Saizaki finally noticed him. &quot;...You? Finally decided to wake your lazy 
ass, eh? Just give me a hand here. We gotta get Lilia to the village. I 
know the people at Ravensburg will be able to help her.&quot;

Rainhande didn&#39;t move a muscle. He just stared at the downed girl. As if 
he was in shock.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you hear me?&quot; Saizaki prodded. &quot;Gimme a hand!&quot;

The Neo-German swordsman backed up a step. &quot;She... has used magics...&quot;

&quot;Well no shit, smart guy!&quot; Saizaki growled under his breath, not 
forgetting the confrontation he had with this man just a short while 
earlier. &quot;What&#39;d you think wiped her out? We&#39;ve gotta to take Lilia to 
an infirmary.&quot;

Rainhande&#39;s steel eyes narrowed. &quot;No. She is one of the enemy.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Saizaki blinked, completely surprised by that remark. &quot;This is 
Lilia! She&#39;s been fighting for us! So what if she uses magic? She&#39;s 
still on our side!&quot;

&quot;How can you be so sure of that?&quot; 

Saizaki sneered at Rainhande. &quot;Because I understand her. And I care 
about her. But you wouldn&#39;t know anything about that, would you, 
Schaidler? A heartless guy like you. So look. You can stand here and 
debate the situation until you&#39;re blue in the face. But I&#39;m taking her 
to an infirmary now. If you wanna make yourself useful, grab the Wind 
Soul and follow me.&quot;

Saizaki grunted as he shifted Lilia&#39;s body into his arms. He waited for 
a moment to get used to the extra weight, then stood upright and slowly 
began walking towards the eastern part of the forest. That is where 
Ravensburg would be. Rainhande picked up the Wind Soul, as Saizaki 
suggested, then thought of something. 

&quot;What about Commander Highland? He will be coming back here.&quot;

Saizaki just focused on Lilia. &quot;Then wait here for him. For god&#39;s sake, 
Aarin will understand. Now are we done talking? I&#39;m taking her out of 
here.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Public Infirmary, Ravensburg, Neo-Germany 

The doctor was very understanding and careful with Lilia. As she lay 
rested on the comfortable looking bed at the centre of the far wall, 
Saizaki and Rainhande observed her progress. She hadn&#39;t woken up just as 
yet. But Saizaki at least kept hope alive. Hope that she would be okay. 
Lilia was hurt now, and Saizaki blamed himself for it. If had of been 
strong enough to take that Diana down, Lilia would never have had to 
push herself like that. And Saizaki would never forgive himself for 
this. 

It had been over five hours since Diana&#39;s ruthless attack. Saizaki had 
taken Lilia to the nearest infirmary in Ravensburg with little effort. 
Rainhande decided to come with Saizaki, leaving a message of explanation 
back at the ruined campsite for Aarin. For now, Saizaki&#39;s concern was 
with Lilia and Lilia alone. The Japanese boy was leaned up against one 
of the walls of the infirmary. Rainhande was sitting on a chair across 
the room. He seemed to want to keep as much distance between himself and 
Lilia as possible. The doctor tending to Lilia went beside her bed and 
took a small washcloth from the cabinet next to it. He dipped the cloth 
into the cool water, drained it, then draped the damp towel over Lilia&#39;s 
forehead.

Saizaki nudged him about that. &quot;What&#39;s the verdict, doc? Is she gonna be 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; The doctor smiled generously, &quot;Your friend has just over-exerted 
herself. I&#39;ve said this before. I don&#39;t know why the Order of Light lets 
people as young as you lot fight in these dreadful wars. At your age you 
should be enjoying your lives.&quot;

Saizaki looked out the window from his position. It was still dark out. 
&quot;Not much of a world left for us to enjoy our lives in.&quot;

&quot;Well regardless, Miss Morin should be fine in a few days. She&#39;ll 
probably awaken in a few hours. I don&#39;t want her disturbed beforehand, 
so, just keep things quiet while you are around her. Understood?&quot;

Saizaki nodded to the doctor. If anything, he wanted Lilia to recover as 
soon as possible. There was no way he was going to aggravate this 
situation. Once the doctor had been assured of that, he left. Leaving 
the three sword wielders to themselves. Those three sword wielders who 
were now also the only members of the of Special Mission Corps. Diana 
had completely annihilated it. These three were now more isolated than 
ever. The reality of this was beginning to weigh on Saizaki&#39;s mind. 
Diana&#39;s forces must have suffered heavy losses too after that last 
battle; but it was essentially the Order of Light that was suffering the 
most. The Special Mission Corps was the last bastion of defence for the 
South of Neo-Germany. If the Covenant&#39;s armies broke the front line 
completely at the Neo-German border... that was it. Game over. 
Neo-Germany was completely theirs. And this was one of the few countries 
left in Europe, un-conquered by the Covenant of Sorcerers. Neo-Russia 
and Neo-Japan were the only two Safe-Zones left in the world that were 
completely free from the Covenant. How long would it be before they 
fell?

Saizaki lost some of his anger towards Rainhande when he realized this. 
&quot;This is serious, isn&#39;t it? The Special Mission Corps is gone... Lilia 
is down... I don&#39;t even think we would have gotten this far if we didn&#39;t 
have these swords. This fight is over. The Covenant has won.&quot;

&quot;I did not take you for a quitter, Saizaki.&quot;

Rainhande and Saizaki looked over at the door when they heard a third, 
more mature voice call on them. It was Aarin. With that large 
Double-Cleaver sword strapped to his back, it could not have been more 
obvious. The wise old swordsman was draped in a musky grey cloak, which 
obscured his face. As soon as Aarin walked through that door, he pulled 
down the hood to reveal himself. 

&quot;Commander Highland.&quot; Rainhande could not say he was unhappy to see him.

Saizaki remained stoic. &quot;You know what&#39;s been going on?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Aarin confirmed it, &quot;I got the message. I saw the damage done to 
the campsite. And I know of Lilia&#39;s outburst. Things have spiralled out 
of control in this situation. And I doubt that Diana will stay hidden 
for long. She&#39;ll eventually recover, and then strike at us with all her 
might.&quot; 

&quot;So what did the council say?&quot; Rainhande asked simply. 

&quot;The council,&quot; It got on Aarin&#39;s last nerve thinking about them, but, 
&quot;The council have a plan. A method of strategy for our next assault. 
They have ordered us to travel to Neo-England and assassinate the leader 
of the Covenant of Sorcerers, Al Gul Jehed.&quot;

Rainhande blinked. &quot;They want us to kill Al Gul Jehed?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. They believe that if we defeat Al Gul then the Covenant 
will be weakened. Then they will use that opportunity to make one last 
push against their armies. It might just be what we need to make this 
terrible situation better.&quot;

Saizaki frowned. He was not as convinced as Aarin and Rainhande were. In 
fact, his conviction for fighting in this army was growing weaker by the 
second. &quot;So the council thinks they can order me head-first into enemy 
territory to kill Al Gul for them, eh? Those arrogant bastards. It&#39;s 
their fault that we went to Rosenheim in the first place! It&#39;s their 
stupid orders that got the Special Mission Corps in the state it&#39;s in 
now! Why the hell should I lay my life on the line for those cowardly 
pen-pushers!?&quot;

Aarin shook his head, sympathetically. &quot;I understand what you must be 
feeling. The shock of what happened to Lilia is affecting all of us. But 
this truly could bring us a step closer to victory. It could change the 
fate of the planet, Saizaki.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what you said about these swords!&quot; Saizaki shot back, &quot;And now 
we&#39;re even worse off than we were without them! Why am I even fighting 
this war? It&#39;s not like the magic-users are bunch of evil demons bent on 
human extinction. Lilia&#39;s a magic-user and she&#39;s more innocent than 
anyone I know. Why the hell should I keep fighting like this?!&quot;

Aarin looked over at the Japanese man. &quot;You have a point, Saizaki. It 
was the Anti-Magic Law of the Neo World Federation that started this 
whole thing off. I doubt there would have ever been war between normal 
human beings and magic users if it not for that law. But this is our 
opportunity to finish the war. End all the killing, end all the 
suffering. What more can we ask for?&quot;

&quot;You can ask for whatever you please. As for me...?&quot; Saizaki kicked off 
the wall, then went for the strap holding Fire Cutter around his waist. 
The sword dropped to the ground, along with the strap. &quot;...I&#39;m done with 
this shit. I can&#39;t take this anymore. I won&#39;t fight for the cowards in 
the council. They caused the deaths of all my friends at Rosenheim. The 
only thing I had left was Lilia, and now she&#39;s in this state. I will not 
fight for people who think that my life is cheap!&quot;

Rainhande was starkly surprised. &quot;You are quitting the Order?&quot;

&quot;You better damn believe it,&quot; Saizaki shot back. 

Just then, Aarin felt an anger arise in him. They really had to time for 
this. &quot;Do not be a fool, Saizaki! You cannot just walk away. Setsuya 
would have never walked away from a battle like this.&quot;

&quot;My father...&quot; Saizaki froze at the mention of him, but was still 
resolute. &quot;...Is not the same man as me. We&#39;re two different people now. 
And I won&#39;t be shackled to a fake salvation. This entire Order is 
crooked! The council is playing us! Why didn&#39;t they tell us that the 
front line was broken three months ago? And why did they send us into 
Rosenheim so quickly? Something about all of this just stinks! And I 
can&#39;t be the only one that thinks so!&quot;

Aarin was still just as relentless. &quot;Giving up is worse than never 
trying at all! You cannot turn your back on the thousands of people that 
need your protection!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Saizaki replied. &quot;I&#39;ve made up my mind. Coming into the Order 
of Light was a mistake. I&#39;m gonna join the regular army. Of the World 
Federation. They may have caused this war but at least they&#39;re committed 
to ending it. Without treating their soldiers like crap.&quot;

&quot;Saizaki, please re-think this,&quot; Aarin pleaded. &quot;We need your skills for 
this mission,&quot;

Saizaki scowled, then walked over to the door, which Aarin was standing 
in front of. Saizaki cast a furious glare at his second teacher, but it 
was met with an equally defiant one. It was apparent that Aarin would be 
in no hurry to move out of Saizaki&#39;s way. More so to the opposite. Aarin 
refused to move. 

&quot;...Get out of my way, Aarin. I&#39;m not gonna fight for a cause when the 
people commanding me act like they&#39;re better than everyone else. Toying 
with my life. Toying with the lives of my loved ones. The council can 
just find themselves another assassin.&quot;

&quot;...So... you&#39;re... running away...?&quot;

All three men, Saizaki, Rainhande and Aarin looked back at the bed over 
the other side of the room. It was Lilia who was speaking to them. She 
had woken up even earlier than the doctor had said she would. But 
Saizaki was the one most pleased to see her up and going.

His heart confirmed it. &quot;...Lilia.&quot;

The stare that Lilia gave to Saizaki was less than comforting. Soon her 
weak lips began to part in speech again. &quot;...Why... are you... 
quitting...? This... isn&#39;t... like you... Saizaki...&quot;

The Japanese man lowered his gaze. &quot;... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

&quot;... Then... stay... with the... Order... for now...&quot;

Saizaki always thought that he could do anything that he wanted. That no 
one could herd him into a corner if he didn&#39;t want to be. But Lilia was 
the one person who he could refuse nothing to. She was the one person in 
his life that he cared the most about at this point. His sword was 
primarily used for defence of her. There were no morals in this. If 
Saizaki had only one good reason to fight, it would be to protect Lilia. 
Just one more mission... 

Saizaki took a moment, and the others could tell there was a brief but 
brutal internal battle going on in there, but he eventually reached a 
conclusion. &quot;...Okay. I&#39;ll help you kill Al Gul Jehed. But that&#39;s it. 
Period. Once he&#39;s dead, I&#39;m leaving the Order of Light. And I don&#39;t give 
a damn what anyone says about it.&quot;

Lilia smiled at him. &quot;Then I&#39;ll... come with you... when you leave...&quot;

&quot;You intend on quitting the Order as well?&quot; Rainhande asked.

She nodded to him. &quot;Saizaki... was right about... one thing... the 
council are... playing us. It is... thanks to them... that the Special 
Mission Corps... is gone...&quot;

Aarin ran a hand through his beard. &quot;I think we are all in agreement 
about the council. I have long suspected corruption. But we do need them 
in this fight. Once we defeat Al Gul Jehed, we can concentrate on where 
we stand with the Order of Light.&quot;

The young captain, Rainhande, lowered his eyes to his sword. &quot;If we can 
defeat him...&quot; 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Helgolander Butch, Neo-Germanic Sea 

Lilia&#39;s recovery was swift. Probably had something to do with the 
magical lineage of hers. But none the less it was swift and so Lilia, 
Saizaki, Rainhande and Aarin could leave for the occupied Neo-England to 
kill Al Gul Jehed. Reaching the northern half of Neo-Germany was 
difficult, but the fastest way to get to Neo-England was by sea. And to 
do that they had to leave for the port of Cuxhaven. It took over two 
weeks of travel, but the four warriors made their way up the Safe Zone 
and reached the very boundaries of it. After spending one night at 
Cuxhaven, they rented out a private boat. It was small in comparison to 
the other ships that were active in this time, but could easily hold the 
four soldiers and the sailor that was taking them to Neo-England 
herself. But no one was prepared for what might happen when they got 
there.

Saizaki leaned over the edge of the railing, looking out into the sea. 
It was a bright day today. But the closer you got to Neo-England, the 
colder it got in return. You could see from the small sheets of ice that 
were smeared over these seas. This part of the world was getting colder 
and colder as the years went by. It probably had something to do with 
the Genesis Comet. Obliterating the fabric of the climate was not 
outside of its power. 

While Saizaki continued to stare out into the distant seas of the north, 
Lilia was walking up to him from behind. They were the only people on 
deck right now, Aarin and Rainhande in their private cabins. The girl 
said nothing, just flopped next to the wistful boy and looked at the sea 
in the same fashion. 

&quot;...Couldn&#39;t sleep, huh?&quot; Saizaki remarked.

Lilia nodded. &quot;Same for you?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

The Neo-French girl took note of that one-word answer. Saizaki was 
usually so loud and conversational that he couldn&#39;t shut up. &quot;Is 
something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Lilia,&quot; He took a look over at her, &quot;Did you mean what you said? That 
when I leave the Order of Light... you will come with me?&quot;

&quot;Of course I will. I made a promise, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

Saizaki squirmed. &quot;But why? I mean... you&#39;re one of the strongest female 
swordfighters they have. You could earn a big position one day... you 
know? Why would you wanna abandon all that...?&quot;

Lilia gave a generous smile and then rested her head upon Saizaki&#39;s 
shoulder, still looking out to that frosty sea. &quot;Because I wouldn&#39;t be 
around you.  What&#39;s the point of having strength if I&#39;m not using it to 
defend the ones I care most about? Besides, I think that when word gets 
out I&#39;m a magic user... I won&#39;t have much time left here.&quot;

Saizaki had been thinking about that a lot. He thought that he knew 
Lilia better than anyone. So why didn&#39;t he know of her biggest secret? 
Surely Lilia trusted him to know? It wasn&#39;t like he was going to freak 
out about it.

The youth put his thoughts ahead. &quot;...Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know myself,&quot; Lilia answered, &quot;I just... I saw you hurt, and I 
saw Diana floating there like it wasn&#39;t a big deal. Something clicked 
inside me and it just came out. It felt like I was in a trance, you 
know? Like I was there but at the same time I wasn&#39;t. It all seems so 
hazy now. I can&#39;t even remember how I cast that thing.&quot;

Saizaki lowered his chin to his crossed arms. &quot;You called it Charade 
Sphere, I think. Pretty damn powerful too. It blew Diana away like she 
was nothing. And it made my attacks look like child&#39;s play.&quot; 

That was one thing that made it less threatening. Lilia giggled 
deviously, then curled her arm around Saizaki&#39;s neck. The girl stood up 
straight on her tip-toes then nudged her fist into Saizaki&#39;s flowing 
brown locks, ruffling them. The two laughed, as Saizaki struggled to 
escape.

&quot;That&#39;s right, Saizaki!&quot; Lilia said between laughs, &quot;I&#39;m a whole lot 
tougher than you, so pay your respects, little boy!&quot;

There was a genuine smile on Saizaki&#39;s face that he hadn&#39;t cast in a 
while. Not since his times with Setsuya. It was hard to explain, being 
that his head was in the middle of a noogie by a girl shorter than he 
was; but it made him happy. Happy that Lilia was calm about her magical 
lineage. And equally calm about the prejudices she was bound to face 
because of them. At no other point was he more sure that he wanted to 
protect her. If there was one thing left on this stinking planet for 
Saizaki to worship and lay down his life for; then it was Lilia. She was 
more than a friend. At least it felt that way to him. The gears of 
realization started turning in the Japanese boy&#39;s head. Saizaki was 
finally beginning to understand why he needed to protect Lilia to his 
last breath. 

He was in love with her.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shrine of Quetzacoatl, Cath Maige Tuired

&quot;Where on earth is the Highland girl and that blasted magic-user?&quot;

The time had come.

The Shrine had not been attacked once since the first attempt made by 
Ursula and her partner and protector, Gram. Though it was not certain if 
it was because of Rhiannon&#39;s twenty remaining troops being stationed 
around the building but it was certain that things were more or less 
secure. Six soldiers wee posted outside at the frontal part of the 
shrine. Where the stone doors had been shattered. The other fourteen 
were on the inside, on constant watch over the Quetzacoatl. The seal was 
going to break any time now. They had to be more vigilant than ever 
considering this. While the soldiers all waited around for the 
performing of the sealing rites with their swords at the ready, Leignitz 
was also with them. But he didn&#39;t group himself in the same category as 
those people. In his opinion, they were just cluttering up the shrine. 

Leignitz stood with his scythe Plague at the ready. He was expecting 
trouble and did not plan on relying on Rhiannon&#39;s forces to defend the 
Quetzacoatl. From what happened two days ago, it was clear that they 
couldn&#39;t stand up to the power of Gram, much less that of Ursula. But he 
was still focused on his true mission rather than just fighting. Which 
was why he was so annoyed to see that Rhiannon and Bonnie were taking so 
long to get here. But he would have to wait no longer than he already 
had. It was a bright day out. The sun pandering through the crater were 
the doors used to be was the only source of clear light coming into the 
shrine. So when two figures appeared in that bright light, Leignitz to 
figure out just whom they were without too much effort. Rhiannon and 
Bonnie stood at the broken doors into the Shrine of the Quetzacoatl. 
This time Rhiannon was dressed fully in her Order of Light tunic. And 
with her weapon at her side. The sword called the White Devil. It was 
crafted for her Grandmother, after the Lightning Tooth was enshrined in 
Tuatha De Danann, by the legendary English sword master, Roundsman. It 
was then given to Rhiannon shortly before Ingrid began training her. It 
had power, but to Rhiannon it had more of a sentimental value. Both she 
and Bonnie walked through the crumbling stone doors to the shrine and 
towards the altar of the staff itself. And while Rhiannon nodded to each 
of her troops in order to make sure that everything was okay, she was 
pleased to see that they were all treating Bonnie with respect. Those 
men and women had been fighting against magic-users for so long that 
they tended to forget that most common magic-users were completely 
normal and peaceful. 

The two women stopped before the altar and the three soldiers standing 
ahead. Rhiannon crossed her arms and spoke. &quot;Is everything okay here? 
Has there been any trouble at all?&quot;

&quot;None, Lieutenant,&quot; One of the troops replied, &quot;There has been no sign 
of the attackers or of anyone else around the shrine. We have everything 
secure for the sealing rites. Just as you ordered.&quot;

Rhiannon nodded to him. &quot;Good. When we report back the smoothness of the 
operation might help the failure two days ago to be overlooked. Now 
then...&quot;

And then she turned to the blonde. &quot;Are you ready to go, Bonnie?&quot;

She nodded. Bonnie was fine about this. She had been preparing for it 
for a while. Now it was time to re-seal the Quetzacoatl and all it 
powers. Rhiannon stepped to one side of her girl and stood away from the 
altar. And Bonnie climbed up the stone steps of it to come face to face 
with the staff itself. Everyone watched while she did this. Then they 
murmured to themselves in wonder as a light purple glow began to 
surround the girl. It was darkness magic. Which was pretty ironic 
considering how friendly a girl Bonnie was. She closed her eyes slowly 
and clasped her hands together. Then began mumbling some ancient tongue 
to herself. Her glow grew in size and brightness. And while she did 
this, the magical seal around the Quetzacoatl stopped flickering in its 
usual manner. The seal stood firm. And which each passing second it 
became stronger than it was. Rhiannon gasped. Bonnie&#39;s energies were 
even stronger than she would have imagined them to be. It would take at 
least twenty minutes of constant effort to re-strengthen the seal but so 
far Bonnie was doing extremely well. 

But two shadows were now descending upon that shrine... 

...The shadows of two people who would not stand for this. 

Outside of the shrine, floating above it in the sunny air of the 
morning, was none other than the child magic-user Ursula and her 
subject, Gram. Gram stood in the sky with his sword Fafnir fully 
energized in one hand. While Ursula sat upon his shoulder like always. 
They had come. And none too soon by the looks of things.

&quot;It&#39;s started.&quot; Gram mouthed slowly.

Ursula nodded. &quot;Yeah. I didn&#39;t expect them to drag their feet after what 
happened last time we came here. Humans scare so easily when it comes to 
magic. And yet they are willing to use a magic-user to protect what they 
fear from others. That proves it. Mankind is just as guilty as the 
Covenant are.&quot;

&quot;How do you wish to do this?&quot; Gram asked, &quot;As we discussed?&quot;

To that Ursula nodded. &quot;Yeah. That would be fine. But try not to kill 
the magic-user before I get a fair idea of her powers.&quot;

Settled. Ursula floated off Gram&#39;s shoulder as she always did, hovering 
back into that warm morning air. While Gram plummeted straight down, now 
out of the influence of Ursula&#39;s more than powerful magics. His steel 
sandaled feet smashed into the ground below him with a great echoing 
crash. And this drew the attentions of the four guards that had been 
posted at the front of the shrine for the sealing ceremony. They all 
gasped as Gram began to rear up from the shallow crater his clunky 
landing had made. The description of Gram had been given to them by 
Leignitz before today. They knew what this creature was. The soldiers 
all nodded to each other then ran straight for the thing. And Ursula 
watched from up above with a potent smile on her face. She knew as well 
as anyone that Gram was far too powerful to be stopped by normal people. 
He was a Genocide Weapon after all. Even as a prototype for the 
Deities... he was amazing.

Gram evened out Fafnir horizontally and waited for the attacks. The 
first soldier came with an overhead blow with his drawn sword. Gram 
thrust his sword against the strike, parrying it. From the rebound came 
the opening. Gram then shot Fafnir straight through the ribcage of the 
first soldier. He coughed violently, spewing blood all over his tunic, 
then faded with a death sigh. Gram ripped his sword out of the carcass 
and let it collapse to the ground in a haze of blood. Soldier #2 came 
from the left. And soldier #3 came from the right. A double attack. Gram 
chucked under his mask and crouched down. Both slashes from the soldiers 
passed over his head as quick as can be. Then Gram stuck Fafnir outwards 
and made a brutal 350 degree spin, slicing right through the bodies of 
soldiers 2 and 3 at waist height. Both of the corpses collapsed into two 
halves on the ground in their own respective pools of blood, bile and 
guts. The final soldier stood shaken as he watched his partners&#39; get
