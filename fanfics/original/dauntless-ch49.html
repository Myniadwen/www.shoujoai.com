<p>“The Holy Annoyance: Yenae’s audacious story  is told!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Booo-ring,” Yenae drawled, yawning and stretching  her arms. Neither the pilot of the <em>Dauntless</em> nor its mousy  owner were to blame for the lag in activity: it had nearly been three  weeks since the incident with Franklin Hill, and nobody had been  willing to go anywhere or do anything afterward, not for a long time  at least. Even so, at least half of the crew was used to a fast-paced  life full of adventure and excitement— and danger— so even though  everybody was still recovering from the ordeal, flying around the  emptiness of space with nothing to do was like Hell for those  innocent few.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” Kyrie said sharply as she  walked past the restless Changeling. “Do you actually miss risking  your life for pointless treasure? Let’s not forget all the freaky  people we’ve run into, some of them even worse than me! Oh yeah,  and what about all the dangerous worlds we’ve seen? I for one am <em>glad</em> that we have a reprieve.”</p>
<p>“Not me,” Yenae grumbled. “Taking a break is  fine, but letting it drag on is irritating. We don’t even have a  destination, do we? If this Origin person is really a problem, we  should be looking for clues!”</p>
<p>“It’s not like we know where to start,” Kyrie  gestured. “Listen, why not keep yourself busy with a hobby— and I  don’t mean chasing after that catgirl.” Yenae sighed.</p>
<p>“She’s taking a bath right now and didn’t want me  to join her. Maybe I’m going about the whole seduction thing wrong.  What do you think I should do?”</p>
<p>“About Alala?”</p>
<p>“No, about all this boredom! At least you have your  gadgets.”</p>
<p>“That I do. I would ask if you wanted to help, but a  novice like you would only get in the way! Besides, Eve and Herut are  perfectly sufficient. If you need some suggestions, why not look  through the Tome of Treasures for a new destination?”</p>
<p>“Don’t you have any?”</p>
<p>“Only one,” she grinned. “I asked Aseria to take  us to Vulcannis, my homeworld. I’ve been meaning to go back there  for some time and catch up with my family. Hey, if I’m not  mistaken, Maisa is on the way there!”</p>
<p>“So it is,” Yenae murmured. Maisa was <em>her</em> homeworld, but she hadn’t visited in years. She had been restless  and eager to explore the universe all of her childhood, and now that  she had the chance, she wouldn’t go back for anything, not even if  it meant her life. She had severed her ties and burned her bridges—  there <em>was </em>no going back for her. Kyrie dismissed herself,  saying she needed to get back to work, leaving Yenae to listlessly  stare at the wall. She decided to go to the gym and work out; maybe  she’d catch a stray TV transmission. Along the way, she ran into  Alala, who was furiously drying her silvery hair. Unfortunately for  Yenae, she was completely dressed and dried off, but at least she  smelled nicer and had a certain glow to her. Yenae’s mood perked up  and she waved for joy.</p>
<p>“Hello, kitten! You’re looking fine today! Did you  get yourself good and clean?”</p>
<p>“Buzz of,” Alala yawned. “I’m having a late  lunch and you’re not invited!”</p>
<p>“That’s not nice,” she pouted. “I thought we  were friends! Let me join you, please? I’m lonely and bored.”</p>
<p>“So go bother somebody else.”</p>
<p>“No one’s as interesting as you!” she gushed,  throwing her arms around her beloved. Alala squeaked and almost fell  over; she pried Yenae off with a snarl.</p>
<p>“Why the hell are you so ANNOYING?!”</p>
<p>“If only I had a gold coin for every time I’ve  heard that,” she chirped. Alala glared at her, but a thought passed  through her head that changed her mood.</p>
<p>“Say, how <em>did</em> you get that nickname of yours?  The ‘Annoyance’ part I can understand, but what about the  ‘Holy’?”</p>
<p>“It’s because I’m such an angel,” she purred  seductively. Alala rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“A <em>fallen</em> angel, maybe! But seriously.”  Yenae leaned forward and smiled.</p>
<p>“Invite me to dinner and I’ll tell you all about  it. We’re approaching my homeworld anyway, so I’m feeling  nostalgic.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? Where is it?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere between here and Vulcannis. I haven’t  been there in ages.”</p>
<p>“Don’t expect me to follow you down!” she  snorted.</p>
<p>“That’s all right: I don’t think I’ll be going  down either. Just passing by is good enough. So how’s everything on <em>your</em> homeworld these days? I’ll bet Dionne and Calliope are  looking forward to that baby.”</p>
<p>I’ve actually been corresponding with my mother a lot  more,” Alala said as she and Yenae walked to the dining room. Their  tails entwined, an unspoken understanding between them that kept  their bond solidified even if they quarreled, but they didn’t hold  hands: Alala jerked hers away.</p>
<p>“That’s wonderful!” Yenae exclaimed. “I’m  happy you and your mother are communicating. I really love her; I  hope she becomes my mother-in-law someday!”</p>
<p>“Just as soon as we start having boys on Tigris,”  Alala muttered— in other words, not a chance at all. Yenae laughed.</p>
<p>“Considering your mother’s pregnancy— and who  knows, maybe she knocked up that wife of hers, too— that might yet  come to pass! Hey, just think, you’ll probably have two little  sisters in about a year!”</p>
<p>“That’s a little disturbing!” she exclaimed with  a shudder. They were at the dining room now, so they gave Chandra  their order and sat down at a table. “Hey, is it just me, or is  Chandra a little ‘off’ these days?”</p>
<p>“Considering she didn’t make a pass at either one  of us, I’d say there’s something wrong. But hey, if a lesbian  pleasure unit isn’t flirting with women, maybe I’ve got a better  chance than I thought!”</p>
<p>“It’s worth considering,” Alala muttered darkly.  “So tell me about yourself. One of the most aggravating things  about you is that I don’t know you very well.”</p>
<p>“Aww, do you wanna get to know me better?”</p>
<p>“Just think of it as morbid curiosity,” Alala  grimaced.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p><em>As you might have known, I was born and raised on  Maisa, a little planetoid that flew around a little sun. Who knows,  it might have been a moon at one point. It’s a world covered in  massive trees, where we lived, and stalagmites as large as mountains,  where we built our main cities, kind of like termites. Most members  of my kind are content to stay there and go about their daily lives,  but not me. I spent every day dreaming I was somewhere else. And then  one day…</em></p>
<p>“Booo-ring,” Yenae drawled, yawning and stretching  her arms. It was just another day on Maisa, where the Changelings  continued to build chaotic houses wherever they wanted and however  they wanted; some even chose to live upside-down, just because they  could. Those who did not build swung from the trees like monkeys,  avoiding the few bridges made for the tourists who actually stopped  there to look around. Yenae Marliir, child of two nameless faces in  the crowd, had long ago mastered the giant forests and had explored  every stalagmite-city she could find, but each day brought her even  more restlessness. It was true that many Changelings felt this way,  but they put their energies to work, creating bizarre cities that  never lasted very long, destroying them and then erecting them  somewhere else. The women gave birth, hunted, and prunes the forests;  the men made the homes and prepared the meals. Yenae was given the  freedom to be wild and anxious, so long as she remembered to follow  her destiny.</p>
<p>“I’m nearly ready to give up!” she exclaimed to  herself as she shimmied up the highest stalagmite-city. Maisa looked  like a hairy pincushion from that height: the cities rising up as  spikes from the dense greenery, and not a bit of surface area could  be seen. Nobody had ever been to the surface and returned, and today  Yenae felt like taking her chances. “Let’s face it,” she  groaned, “I’ve been everywhere and done everything this stinking  world has to offer! I’m not even 240 years old yet— don’t tell  me I’ve accomplished everything already!” She had no audience to  assure her; she despised the company of her relatives and had  isolated all of her friends. Yenae was simply starved for something  that Maisa did not have, and she ached to go out past the boundary of  the sky in order to satisfy herself.</p>
<p>“I can’t go back to Laminas again,” she muttered,  referring to her mentor.</p>
<p><em>Oh, right, I never told you. This filthy old hobo I  ran into sort of taught me a few things about fighting. He used to be  an assassin, but now he spent his time getting wasted in the gutter!  I guess I sort of had pity on him at first— yeuch, he thought of me  as his daughter or something— but I quickly got over him and went  on to better things. I would say that I owed him, but after he tried  to take advantage of me, I’d say we’re pretty square. Now where  was I?</em></p>
<p>“I can’t go back to Laminas again, and it’s not  like I have any money to charter a spaceship. Rates have gotten worse  ever since the Ozmunds ran into those Dark Star Stalkers, or whatever  the hell they’re calling themselves. Of course, it’s not like a  ship <em>comes</em> here very often…”</p>
<p><em>No, honey, I didn’t start out at the boring part.  This is actually the moment when I decided to sneak aboard a ship and  run away with it. You just ruined the moment! Oh, all right, I can  see you’re impatient, but try to relax. I’ll get to a good part  soon.</em></p>
<p>Yenae knew that if she got a job on Maisa, she would  probably never leave, so she stayed unemployed, surviving by hunting  in the forests. She was a natural tracker, thanks in part to the  skills Laminas taught her, but somehow, survival didn’t appeal to  her. She kept pestering the Tourist Center for information regarding  incoming ships, until at last they banned her from ever approaching  (and you know that whenever a Changeling irritates another  Changeling, there’s something very troubling about them). Not one  to be discouraged, Yenae visited the Maisa Observatory, the Air and  Space Division, the Astronomical Watch, even the Ladies’ Amateur  Rocketry and Propulsion Club— all of which she was banned from a  few days later. Even a Changeling would have surrendered by that  point and followed their dreary destiny, but Yenae was incredibly  persistent, and followed whatever organization she could find that  would get her one step closer to the heavens.</p>
<p>And then, one day, a tourist came to Maisa. She  immediately snuck onboard, secluded herself, and flew away unseen,  waiting for the ship to land somewhere else— anywhere, really. Once  it made port (on a strange world called Mercury), she immediately  swapped vessels, mostly because she didn’t like the looks of the  place. That ship took her all the way to Silvanus, where she stayed  for a few weeks before jumping onto another outbound vessel. To make  a long story short, Yenae kept this wild pace up for two years,  always jumping from ship to ship whenever she felt bored, always  ready to confront new worlds and new adventures. Her dream had been  realized at last, and yet she still felt unfulfilled. Something was  missing.</p>
<p>And then came the Dark Star Stalkers…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It wasn’t unusual for one of Yenae’s ships to run  into space pirates, especially if they wandered into Fringe  Territory, which was not yet protected by UCM jurisdiction. It was,  however, unusual for them to put up a fight. Usually they just fled,  or were shot down, and Yenae would either have to escape or take out  the pirates herself.</p>
<p><em>Don’t give me that look! One time I single-handedly  wiped out an entire galleon of rogues! But since that doesn’t  figure into my story, I’ll tell you about it later.</em></p>
<p>But to go toe-to-toe with the galaxy’s worst? That  was something she had never seen before, and she admired her new  friends for it, even if they were doomed. The battle was long and  bloody, and both sides suffered great casualties, but in the end, the  merchants simply stood no chance, and were overwhelmed. Yenae took  this opportunity to cram herself inside an empty barrel, pack herself  in, and seal herself up, knowing that a respectable pirate wouldn’t  resist a good haul. After about an hour of cramped, impatient  waiting, Yenae felt herself being jostled around— hoisted, carried,  and put back down again, not without a few bumps and bruises. Once  she was settled, she waited another hour, burst out of her cage,  stretched her aching muscles, and went about her conquest.</p>
<p>“One ship’s as good as another,” she reasoned.  All that waiting had paid off: the pirates had celebrated their  victory with women, wine, and lots of food, so by the time she crept  out and began slinking around their ship, all but a handful were dead  asleep. She immediately went to the Captain’s quarters, expecting  him to be shoulder-deep in whores and loot, but was mildly surprised  when she discovered he was gone. The whores and loot were still  there, so he must have just stepped out. Figuring that, after all  that beer and beef, he would probably be in the toilet, she slithered  past the drowsy women and approached the Captain’s private  bathroom, which was locked. As soon as he came out, she snapped his  neck, plundered his pockets, and sounded the alarm.</p>
<p>The crew was so drunk and disoriented when they came  out that they accepted their Captain’s demise and his transferal of  leadership with nothing more than a shrug. Yenae tossed his body  overboard, and promised to lead her men with even more reckless  enthusiasm than before, which garnered a cheer. Nobody sobered up  until the next day, and when they learned what had happened, many of  them chose not to be angry, and those that did were soon persuaded.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t as pretty as this Captain is,” they’d  say, or, “He never would’ve let us get away with that. She’s a  bright ray in a gray world. That’s mighty poetic, that is. Yeah,  she’s a good Captain. But I hope the last one rests in peace.”  Yenae actually proved to be an excellent Captain, and for many years,  she plundered, stole, and terrorized half the galaxy, earning enemies  and colorful nicknames everywhere she went (but the only one that  stuck wouldn’t come until later).</p>
<p><em>So that’s how I became a Captain. Now let me tell  you what happened to the pirates, and how I got my nickname.</em></p>
<p>All those years of marauding and mischief couldn’t go  on without repercussions, and Yenae was smart enough to realize this.  Sooner or later, even the best pirates and criminals are captured—  or killed— so Yenae began formulating a plan for this eventuality.  One day, as her ship was just setting sail from the port in New  London, a UCM scout ship alerted the armada of their presence, and a  galaxy-wide hunt and chase commenced. It lasted nearly three months,  with Yenae’s pirates fighting against their pursuers in skirmishes,  or sending them on fool’s chases through asteroid fields and black  hole clusters, until finally the UCM became serious and sent out its  Dreadnoughts.</p>
<p>“That will be the end of us,” her men murmured. “We  can do fine against a ship or two, but a Dreadnought?”</p>
<p>“I hear they’re starting to recruit ten percent of  the entire armada to fight us,” another shivered.</p>
<p>“So why haven’t we been recruiting as well?”  Yenae asked.</p>
<p>“But we have, we have— anybody willing to stand up  against them! Why, the Dead Roses said they’d be meeting up with us  somewhere around Centania! We also got the Green Eagles on our side,  and we all know how much the pigs are afraid of them!”</p>
<p>“Okay, good— so why are <em>we</em> afraid?” The  pirates glanced at each other ominously.</p>
<p>“Well, three reasons, Cap’n. First off, they got  this military brat genius with em’ that’s been makin’ off with  all our other allies. Whoever we can’t recruit, she captures and  hangs, and I’m afraid to say that she’s worked faster than we  have so far. Second of all, due to all this huntin’ their new fox  has been undertaking, they’ve got numbers on us now. Finally, what  I heard is that they’ve got solid connections with the Ozmund  people, and they’re banding together to block out all the ports.  They don’t have all of em’ yet, I mean, but they got plenty  enough.”</p>
<p>“So their goal is to starve us, steal our friends,  and intimidate us. Hmm.” This was actually a better opportunity  than Yenae had hoped. Her original scenario would have simply led her  to jump ship at the last minute, like she always did, but now that  they had this high probability of losing… “All right, I’ve come  up with a plan! So you say their new Captain is something decent, eh?  Then let’s hit her with everything we have and take her hostage!  Even if we are outnumbered, a blitzkrieg will at least turn the  intimidation tables around. Sometimes a high morale is better than a  strong ally.”</p>
<p>“That’s our Captain!” they shouted. “I knew  she’d come up with a plan! Wipe out that bitch first and take her  pretty head home! And who knows, we might have some fun with her!”</p>
<p>And as the days and hours drew closer to the decisive  battle, Yenae couldn’t help but wonder what her old partner the  Jackal would think if she were here.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Years of plundering and creating havoc across half the  galaxy had its repercussions, but it also had its rewards. Yenae’s  pitiful little band of outlaws had now grown into an entire fleet,  thanks to years of hard work, negotiations, saving a few lives here  and there, blood-oaths, and wild promises made (plus a few backs  stabbed along the way). Realistically, they could hold their own  against at least a fourth of the entire United Military army and  armada, so when they sailed into battle against the new Captain’s  ship, spirits were high and songs were loud. The fight started out as  a skirmish, with both sides exchanging fire, Yenae’s flagship and  the military newcomer locking horns in single combat.</p>
<p>“I gotta hand it to that Captain they found,” she  purred. “For a recent graduate, she can handle herself well. I  wonder if she’s that tactical in bed.”</p>
<p>“I sure do hope so!” her men sighed dreamily. Yenae  rolled her eyes and pressed the attack. Any moment now, she was  expecting the Captain to call upon her backup, just as soon as her  knees were scraped a little. But that woman had more pride and skill  than Yenae gave her credit for: even when the ship was crippled, she  still continued to fight.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, give it up, bitch! Nobody can defeat the <em>Preemptive</em>!”</p>
<p>“Our Captain’s the best! She’s never been beaten  and she never will be beaten!”</p>
<p>“Run back home to mama! Or maybe you can surrender  and we can have some fun!”</p>
<p>“Just settle down,” Yenae warned them. “She’s  an excellent opponent. It’s poor sportsmanship to insult your  equals, especially if they’re down. I take my hat off to her.”</p>
<p>“But, uh, Captain, you’re not wearing a hat.”</p>
<p>“I was talking metaphorically,” she groaned. The  fight tottered in Yenae’s favor, until at last the enemy Captain  called her reserve forces. Twenty Dreadnoughts, fifty galleons, a  hundred police vessels, and countless fighters poured out of the  darkness of space, having waited just for this moment. Yenae called  her entire armada to bear, and one of the most intense space  conflicts in recent history began.</p>
<p><em>This part’s actually pretty long, so I’ll gloss  over it and move on. Well, you’ll find out who that enemy Captain  was in a moment, but I think you already know.</em></p>
<p>After a titanic struggle, the United Cosmic Military  was forced to admit defeat, which caused every soul in the pirate  armada to let out a cheer. At last, their oppressors had been  defeated, and the freedom and indulgence of piracy could continue  until the end of eternity, unchecked and unchallenged. All of their  names would go down in history, and would be feared for generations  to come. Captain Yenae Marliir was not only a hero, she was a legend,  and the other Captains unanimously elected her to act as their  Supreme Commander of piracy. All of these praises and accolades would  have satisfied anybody, but there was still something missing in  Yenae’s life: she felt her calling was taking her somewhere else.  She could not be an outlaw forever— it just wasn’t what she was  looking for.</p>
<p>“Pardon me, O defeated Captains of the United  Military,” she announced. “My name’s Yenae, and I’m sort of  the leader of this salty bunch. I’d just like to say that you  really gave us the fight of our lives, and we’ve enjoyed being your  enemies over the years. I can’t remember the last time we’ve had  this much fun.”</p>
<p>“What an ass,” the enemy Captain muttered.</p>
<p>“But since we’ve sort of reached the pinnacle of  our career, I really don’t see any point in continuing. Besides,  we’re badly damaged over here, and we only won by a hair!  Therefore, I would like to surrender my entire armada over to your  forces, and place myself in your generous hands. Thank you, and have  a wonderful day!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Both sides were so dumbfounded that the whole area  experienced total silence for five minutes.</p>
<p>“Sorry, boys,” Yenae gushed as she left the bridge  for the escape shuttle. “It’s nothing personal; I just don’t  want to settle into this sort of life. You understand, right? Piracy  was fun for a few years, but I want to experience more! Besides, you  all seem to have something against women. It’s like a sausage fest  every day for me, and— don’t take this the wrong way, brothers—  I’m really not into that. But have fun in prison, okay? Just tell  them Yenae the Angel of Chaos sent you! Buh-bye!”</p>
<p>They would never see her again.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“You’ll have to excuse me for the sharp greeting,”  Yenae snarled as she held a knife to the Commodore’s throat. “I’m  sort of under the impression that you’re going to arrest me and  have me executed. I’m enjoying my life a little too much right now,  so I can’t afford to get killed just yet. Why don’t we make a  deal, and we can forget we were ever in this ticklish situation?”</p>
<p>The Commodore couldn’t understand why the leader of  the pirate armada surrendered just when she had achieved victory—  and a very humiliating victory at that, one that would be permanently  erased from military archives— and he certainly couldn’t  understand why she abandoned her crew just to sneak aboard his ship  and strike a deal with him. The Captain in charge of this section, a  shining new recruit called Chuunaru, rushed to the bridge as fast as  possible once she heard the news, holding a gun and aiming it right  at Yenae’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Drop him now and put your hands up where I can see  them!”</p>
<p>“Oh please, spare me the hostage melodrama,” Yenae  yawned. “Nobody’s going to kill anybody so long as my humble  demands are met. Say, you wouldn’t happen to be the Captain of the <em>Neo Yamato</em>, would you?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so that was you! Well met, friend! Nobody’s  ever given me that much of a challenge before, and I gotta say, if we  weren’t enemies right now, I’d come over there and kiss you!”</p>
<p>“Annoying vermin,” Chuunaru snarled. Yenae sighed  wistfully.</p>
<p>“Ah, if only I had a gold coin for every time I’ve  heard that. Listen, Captain Sexy— ”</p>
<p>“It’s Chuunaru, scum!”</p>
<p>“Right, right, Chuunaru. Listen, drop the gun and the  attitude, Chuunaru. I like you and I want us to be friends. You put  up a great fight, and that’s something I can respect. I just want  to negotiate with your superior, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Drop him now and we can talk!”</p>
<p>“Now is this any way to treat the woman that handed  over a third of the galaxy’s criminals and pirates? Your gallows  will be stuffed for weeks! Show me a little gratitude, okay? Now,  Commodore Puppy— ”</p>
<p>“It’s Wolfe!” he barked. He certainly looked like  one.</p>
<p>“Very apropos,” she giggled darkly. “Commodore  Wolfe, then— let’s make a deal. I gave you the pirates and I’ve  got a knife on your throat. I like this new Captain of yours a lot: I  can see her going places. In fact, why not make <em>me</em> a Captain,  too? Sure, why not! Hell, I’ll even serve under you! I do have  experience, after all.”</p>
<p>“You’re out of your mind!” Chuunaru snapped,  brandishing her weapon. Yenae pointed to her and smirked.</p>
<p>“Ah-ah-aaah, that’s no way to speak to your new  best friend, Chuunaru. I’d like to be in the military for awhile so  I can work alongside my dear Miss…uh, what’s your first name,  sweetheart?”</p>
<p>“Last warning, fool! Drop the gun or say farewell to  your brains!”</p>
<p>“But aren’t you going to give me amnesty in  exchange for all the information I’ve gathered over the years?”  she purred. A malicious glow burned in Yenae’s eyes, and she  gradually let the Commodore go. “That’s right: amnesty and a  Captain’s position in your little club. Those are my demands. In  exchange, the Commodore doesn’t get to have his throat punctured,  and I’ll answer any question you have about pirate activity. I’m  perfectly willing to cooperate if you will.”</p>
<p>“Lower your weapon, Captain Chuunaru,” Wolfe  growled, rubbing his neck as Yenae released him. “That’s an order  now. I don’t like it any more than you do, but if she’s willing  to cooperate like that, we can give her the benefit of the doubt.  Besides…” He pulled her close and whispered in her ear: “(If  she’s under my command, or if she’s close to you, we can keep an  eye on her. I don’t know if this devil-woman is a fool or a genius,  but either way, somebody needs to watch over her. I trust you’ll  accommodate her.)”</p>
<p>“If those are your orders, sir,” she muttered. The  Commodore straightened himself up, turned around, and reluctantly  saluted to Yenae.</p>
<p>“Very well then, we accept your demands. From here on  out, you are Captain Yenae Marliir, under my command. And may God  help us all.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!” she squealed, throwing her arms around  them both. “I have a feeling we’ll be great friends! I am, after  all, the Angel of Love and Peace!”</p>
<p>“If that’s true, then you’re the holiest  annoyance I’ve ever met,” Chuunaru grumbled. Yenae liked this  comment so much that the nickname has stuck ever since.</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“After I climbed up the ranks and honed my skills, I  decided to leave the military and start my career as a freelancer. I  was never bored, of course, but it just didn’t feel the same. After  a few weeks of that, I read Amy’s cute little ad, and I felt like I  had finally found my calling. And the rest, as they say, is history.”</p>
<p>Yenae’s story had dragged on for so long that the  dining room was now closed, forcing Alala and Yenae to move to  another room to continue. They hopped from the library, the gym, the  research center, the observatory, and finally to the baths, where the  story ended as they took a relaxing dip. Yenae had spoken with a  mixture of pride, shame, nonchalance, humor, and longing, and she  finally concluded it with a sweet, silent smile, aimed directly at  her meditative audience. Alala honestly didn’t know what to think  about it. On the one hand, she couldn’t help but admire Yenae for  her swashbuckling and double-crossing— but this also caused her to  distrust the Changeling even more. She realized what a crafty,  manipulative, charming, and elusive creature had joined their ranks,  and viewed her with equal amounts of respect and caution.</p>
<p>“That’s…some story,” she admitted quietly. She  couldn’t think of anything else to say.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve had some life. But even after all that,  I’d like to think that I’m a generally good person. I just made a  few powerful enemies along the way!”</p>
<p>“It’s a wonder that Captain Chuunaru didn’t try  to capture you at the Race!”</p>
<p>“Or Becky, for that matter,” Yenae said. She smiled  gently at Alala and scooted a little closer. “So does this change  your opinion on me?” she whispered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but I don’t know how. I mean, I don’t know  whether to admire you or be afraid of you.”</p>
<p>“How about the first option?” she replied warmly.  “I may be a mischievous little imp, but I’m not evil: I just set  out to survive whatever’s coming my way. Just like you!”</p>
<p>“We’re nothing alike,” Alala grumbled.</p>
<p>“Oh, we’re more similar than you think. But you <em>are</em> smarter and cuter than me.”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she grumbled. “But you said in your  story you were almost 240 years old. Are the Changelings a long-lived  species?”</p>
<p>“No, not by most standards. Maisa just orbits our sun  very quickly. That’s the thing about ages: they all depend on the  planet you were born on. On some worlds, I’m 245 years old, while  on others, I’m barely three. According to galactic standard  measurements, I’m twenty-five years old, more or less. Why, did you  think an older woman was flirting with you, grumpy butt?”</p>
<p>“Knock it off,” she growled. “I still don’t  know why you tease me like that.” Yenae smiled warmly and reached  for her hand again, breathing deeply.</p>
<p>“You know…the only reason I do that is because I  don’t know how else to show you I care. But if you want the bare  truth, I can give it a try. I’m absolutely in love with you, Alala,  and I’ve felt like that for a long time. Someday, I’d like to  gain your trust.”</p>
<p>This made Alala smile, just a little. She looked Yenae  in the eye and saw that, behind the crazed wildfire she was  irresistibly attracted to, there was a genuine love that only came  out for her. For all her maddening nuances, Yenae really did care;  Alala just wasn’t sure if she could completely trust her or not. In  truth, she badly wanted to give her heart away, but being rejected so  many times before had made her bitter and wary. It wasn’t her  fault: none of her past lovers ever felt they could measure up to  her. Perhaps even Yenae didn’t consider herself Alala;s equal, but  even so…</p>
<p>“Maybe. You know, you can actually be pretty nice  when you want to.” And then for the third time they kissed, with  all of Alala’s hopes being thrown in. She longed to savor Yenae for  days on end— she wanted it, she wanted it, she wanted it so badly—  Yenae drove her crazy and she loved it so, so, so much— but she  couldn’t allow herself to trust, not yet, not yet. They broke off  and she pointed at Yenae threateningly.</p>
<p>“Don’t you dare tell anybody I did that!”</p>
<p>“My lips are sealed,” she purred. Alala rolled her  eyes and demanded that Yenae get out first, so she wouldn’t be able  to ogle her.</p>
<p>“And what will keep <em>you</em> from staring at <em>me</em>,  fluffy muffin?”</p>
<p>“Just get out! You’re relaxed enough!”</p>
<p>“True, true,” she sighed. Alala couldn’t resist a  little peek, and washed her face so it wouldn’t look like she was  dazed. Yenae frustrated her to no end, and she loved her for it.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>But there was no WAY she would ever tell her!</p>
