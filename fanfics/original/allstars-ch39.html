5:00 pm

 

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all wondering why I&#39;m standing here before you and 
Leena isn&#39;t. The simple truth is that Miss P.K. was obliged to take care 
of some business back home, and had to take some time off so she could 
see to this. Of course, this means that she&#39;ll be out of the country for 
at least a week, which means that she needed a substitute coach for her 
soccer team- and since Bracton was not available to fill the gap, I 
guess that leaves one other person as your temporary coach. In other 
words,&quot; said Arthur Warren smugly, &quot;ME.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Shannon groaned.

&quot;And with five days before our next game,&quot; Fausta sighed.

&quot;We&#39;re doomed,&quot; Kasumi deadpanned. Oblivious to their protests, Warren 
grinned proudly and snickered as he stood before the stunned sixteen.

 

All he has to do is just walk around downtown,

He&#39;s a playful man who catches the eyes of those he meets

Oh! That&#39;s why you see he will be our hero from now on,

So let&#39;s begin the countdown for change!

One two three four five,

Take a deep breath and one-two,

Now stride out with your head held high,

Downtown dance!

 

&quot;The Irresponsible Coach Warren&quot;

 

Day 1

 

&quot;Run that by us again,&quot; Fausta groaned, squeezing the bridge of her nose 
in frustration.

&quot;Why, are you hard of hearing? I said I&#39;ll be your coach for the next 
week. It&#39;s as simple as that.&quot;

&quot;That can&#39;t be,&quot; she grunted. Elisa nervously wrung her hands, just as 
concerned as her friend and teammate.

&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Warren, but really, are you quite positive those were 
Leena&#39;s instructions? I think we all want to be perfectly clear on this. 
No need to jump to any, uh...rash conclusions.&quot;

&quot;Look, I don&#39;t see what all the fuss is about!&quot; he said, throwing his 
arms up. &quot;Leena needed someone to take over for her and she chose me. I 
really don&#39;t see why that&#39;s so hard to swallow.&quot;

&quot;There are lots of reasons,&quot; Fleur grumbled, &quot;and even if we had a 
month, we wouldn&#39;t have time for me to get into them. Mainly, sir, 
you&#39;re the laziest, sloppiest, most laid-back and irresponsible sloth of 
a man I&#39;ve ever seen.&quot;

&quot;Besides, didn&#39;t you say yourself that you don&#39;t know anything about 
soccer?&quot; Felicity pointed. Warren raised his eyebrow at them and, 
surprisingly, began to laugh boisterously.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I just thought I was here to instruct a team, not a pack of 
whiners.&quot;

&quot;But your credentials are- &quot;

&quot;My credentials are fine. Rosewood trusts me, and I guess Leena does 
too. Look, there&#39;s nothing to worry about. It&#39;ll be fine! At any rate, 
miss...uh, La-croicks- &quot;

&quot;La-croy,&quot; she snarled. Lauren muffled a laugh.

&quot;Oh, my bad. At any rate, La-croicks, if you&#39;re worried about wasting 
time, you&#39;ve let five whole minutes slip by already! All this bitching 
and moaning about poor old me, who&#39;s only doing somebody a favor, and 
you&#39;re supposed to be training?&quot;

&quot;I forgot to add frustrating to the list!&quot; Fleur snapped. Rain put her 
arms on the brunette&#39;s shoulders and started massaging.

&quot;Now-now, it&#39;s only for a week. We&#39;ve already improved from our last 
game against Braithwaite, so I doubt he&#39;d be able to unravel all that by 
the time we go against St. Jeanne.&quot;

&quot;Actually, I was hoping you all could do all the work,&quot; Warren admitted 
gruffly as he scratched his head. &quot;I mean, what with me having no 
knowledge of this sport.&quot;

&quot;See? I told you! Lazy!&quot;

&quot;Whatever helps you sleep at night, Miss La-croicks,&quot; he resigned. He 
meandered away, yawning and stretching his arms, and found some 
bleachers to sleep on. Half the team stood gaping at him, while the 
other half tried to remember there were more important things at stake.

&quot;So is this really going to be hands-off?&quot; Felicity called. &quot;You&#39;re just 
leaving this to us?&quot; Warren waved numbly.

&quot;If I step in, I&#39;ll just undo everything Leena worked for, right? You&#39;re 
all adults; you can take care of yourselves.&quot; He covered his face with 
his arm and seemed to drift away; that left the team standing around 
with no direction to take.

&quot;Just great,&quot; Shannon grunted. &quot;Well, I ain&#39;t standin&#39; around waitin&#39; 
for Rip Van Winkle to snap outta it! Rain, Amy, let&#39;s do some laps 
togethah!&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan.&quot; The three of them started jogging; gradually, the 
other women dispersed and began performing drills. Those most heavily 
opposed to this new direction found it hardest to return to &quot;business as 
usual&quot;, but it was either that or neglect their training, and since 
their pride was on the line...

&quot;Kasumi,&quot; Fausta said in a commanding voice, &quot;let&#39;s just go ahead and 
start working. Lauren and Valencia are waiting for us.&quot;

&quot;All right. You coming, Fleur?&quot;

&quot;I suppose,&quot; she resigned. Warren opened one eyelid and watched them all 
return to their duties with a smile. So far, he had not even lifted a 
finger, and it looked like they were working harder than ever.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t so hard. Wonder how long I can keep this up.&quot;

Day 2

 

Once classes were over, the team headed to the locker rooms, got 
changed, and met outside for their daily pep talk- except that they 
didn&#39;t have Leena&#39;s beauty, charm, and wisdom to look forward to. 
Instead, they met up with a disheveled, bleary-eyed, yawning, 
middle-aged man sporting a five o&#39;clock shadow, clothes that looked like 
they had been slept in (several buttons were askew), and a disquieting 
smile. Valencia cautiously raised her hand as he greeted them.

&quot;Ah, afternoon, one and all! So how&#39;d practice go yesterday? I kind of 
nodded off before I got the chance to see. ...Uh, yes, Miss, uh...&quot;

&quot;Durante. Um, practice was fine, Mr. Warren- &quot;

&quot;It was awful,&quot; Fausta spat. &quot;We were sloppy and unorganized. I&#39;ve never 
seen us flail around like that before.&quot;

&quot;Why, was something wrong?&quot;

&quot;Of course something was wrong!&quot; Fausta cursed violently in Italian and 
didn&#39;t stop until Warren yawned and turned his attention back to 
Valencia.

&quot;So you were saying?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t turn your back on me! It&#39;s your responsibility to get this- &quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, one second, will ya? Now, Miss Durante, you were saying.&quot;

&quot;I think Fausta&#39;s saying it better,&quot; she replied sheepishly. &quot;We&#39;re just 
frustrated, is all. Are you really just going to lie there while we run 
around without a clear direction? I mean, you&#39;re our coach! You should 
do something!&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot; he grunted.

&quot;I...I don&#39;t know!&quot; she sputtered. &quot;I don&#39;t know what a coach is 
supposed to do! I&#39;m still new at this!&quot;

&quot;Then what are you complaining for?&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;If you don&#39;t know, 
how the hell should I?&quot;

&quot;Because Leena put you in charge of us for a reason!&quot; Shannon yelled. 
&quot;Y&#39;ain&#39;t supposed to sit around sleepin&#39;!&quot;

&quot;So are you saying you&#39;re all totally incompetent without someone 
holding your hand? Is that it?&quot; The smug, condescending look on his face 
was the last straw. Fausta and Shannon both balled their fists up, ready 
to strike.

&quot;Oh, hell no. That&#39;s all we can take.&quot;

&quot;You gonna fight?&quot; he grunted. &quot;Just look at you! You&#39;re a mess! And you 
think I&#39;m incompetent? At least I ain&#39;t the one blaming someone else for 
their own mistakes, or getting angry over nothing. You all look like 
you&#39;re about to tear me apart! If you&#39;re really this flimsy, it would be 
pointless for me to try and direct you. And if you can&#39;t even get one 
practice session right without someone there watching over you, what 
else can I do except sleep?&quot; Fausta had heard enough; she blindly threw 
a punch. Warren&#39;s hands were surprisingly quick, though, and he caught 
her fist easily- along with the follow-up blow.

&quot;All this energy going to waste! Calm down for three seconds, will ya? 
Kasumi, Terra, hold her back, please. Now take a deep breath, everyone, 
and think about what I said. You&#39;re really terrible but you think it&#39;s 
my fault. The fact of the matter is, you can&#39;t adjust to change. 
Something throws a wrench in your designs and you go ballistic. Now I&#39;m 
not saying I&#39;ll be Leena&#39;s match when it comes to telling you guys what 
to do, or how to play. Hell, I don&#39;t know why she picked me in the first 
place. But I made it here all the same. If you wanna play like you mean 
it, you gotta give me something in return. But if you&#39;re happy running 
around like chickens when the fox comes, that&#39;s your call too. Decide 
quickly before I go catch some more Zs.&quot;

Warren&#39;s words struck deep in their hearts, and deeper still in their 
pride. Few wanted to admit he was right, but what he said made perfect 
sense. Even though he knew next to nothing about football, after only 
one day of observation, he could tell it like it was quite accurately, 
and understood their weaknesses and what they needed to get the job 
done. Fausta, Shannon, and a few of the other hotheads gradually 
regained their senses, and wondered if maybe, there was some outside 
chance he was right. The change had been a great shock, and none of them 
were prepared.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Shannon murmured. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;ve been a jackass.&quot;

&quot;Changes happen during the game all the time,&quot; Arina noticed. &quot;We can&#39;t 
rely on what was in order to win; we can only see what is.&quot;

&quot;Or in Sh-Sh-Shannon Wilson&#39;s c-case, what m-m-might be,&quot; Amy smirked.

&quot;And if we can&#39;t adjust to these changes and turn them in our favor, 
we&#39;ll lose.&quot; Arine glanced at her teammates with a wry expression: 
psychology at work.

&quot;Okay, so a few of us screwed up,&quot; Fausta admitted. &quot;And I guess we put 
too much pride on the line. But Lord knows I&#39;m willing to sacrifice some 
to win.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to have to give up every last morsel before you come even 
close to winning,&quot; Warren stated in a voice too serious for his 
appearance. &quot;When it comes to sports, pride is the first thing that has 
to go. But luckily,&quot; he cackled, &quot;with me at the helm, you won&#39;t even 
know what pride is! I&#39;ll humiliate you so fast, it&#39;ll make your head 
spin! Waahaahahahahaha!!!&quot;

&quot;Okay, shaddap!&quot; Shannon screamed. &quot;We&#39;re all sorry for bursting out 
like that, but now we&#39;re ready to play! So whaddya have in mind...um, 
coach?&quot;

&quot;Oh, not much,&quot; he beamed humbly, rubbing his stubble. &quot;Just a little 
contest. Miss von Hohenheim, could you go to my car and bring me the 
buckets and cups you see there?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes sir.&quot; She walked away with Alice tagging along to help. Nadia 
crossed her arms.

&quot;Something iz telling me, I will maybe not like what he haz for 
storing.&quot;

 

The team was divided into four teams of four, all on one side of the 
field, armed with small measuring cups. On the other side was acting 
Coach Warren, arms crossed as he stood guard over four buckets. Behind 
the teams was a tub of water. Most of the girls caught on to what he had 
in mind once they surveyed the field, but then he threw a curve and 
asked for their arms to be tied behind their backs.

&quot;The game is hands-free Water Relay, ladies,&quot; he announced. &quot;The object 
is simple. Using those measuring cups, you must take the water from that 
pool and pour it into these gallon buckets until they&#39;re filled to the 
brim! Of course, that&#39;s easier said than done, since you can&#39;t use your 
arms and those are one-fourth cups! The four teams will be graded on how 
fast they can fill up the buckets, AND how few trips they have to make! 
Take some time to form a strategy, girls. When you hear the whistle, get 
er&#39; done!&quot;

&quot;I have been thinking we came for football practice and not games,&quot; 
Nadia said.

&quot;Who knows what&#39;s in that man&#39;s head,&quot; Jennifer stated. &quot;I guess we just 
have to get through it. Okay, how are we going to do this?&quot;

&quot;I think he means for us to use our teeth,&quot; Elisa said. &quot;Take the cups 
in our mouths, dip them, and head towards those buckets with as much 
water remaining as possible. That means no running.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a balancing drill,&quot; Jennifer noted. &quot;I think I&#39;m starting to see 
his method.&quot;

&quot;Warren doesn&#39;t have a method,&quot; Shannon sighed. &quot;He&#39;s just a lunatic.&quot;

&quot;But you have been saying &#39;I will do this no matter what&#39;, and this is 
&#39;what&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Yer crazy too, ya know,&quot; Shannon glared. Nadia giggled and volunteered 
to go first; Warren blew the whistle and havoc ensued. It was difficult 
enough dipping the small measuring cups into the pool, which was at 
ground level- you had to squat down and thrust it in with your whole 
head, which oftentimes meant getting soaked- and transferring them to 
the bucket was a chore, to say the least. Some of the more unbalanced 
girls spilled all but a few drops on their first go, while people like 
Jennifer, Terra, and Arina were smaller and had more stable centers of 
gravity. Andre practically flew across on her first try, while Alice 
actually had to go back and get a refill before making it halfway. Some 
teams sent their people out one at a time, while others sent all four at 
once. Freya had organized her team to send people out in intervals: when 
one had reached a certain distance, another would begin her run. This 
way, there would always be somebody running, filling, and pouring. 
Thanks to this strategy, her team filled the bucket up first, although 
Jennifer&#39;s team had the least number of runs.

&quot;Great job, everyone!&quot; Warren shouted once everyone had filled their 
bucket. &quot;Boy, that was some fun, huh? I only wish I had brought my 
recorder!&quot;

&quot;That was hard!&quot; Lauren exclaimed. &quot;And I got soaked, too.&quot;

&quot;Well, maybe later on, we can do this without anybody getting wet. But 
for right now, it&#39;s safe to assume that you&#39;re all ready for my next 
task! And it&#39;s even tougher and more entertaining than this one!&quot; 
Everyone groaned, but they had no choice: not if they wanted to keep 
winning games, anyway.

&quot;Please, Leena, come back soon,&quot; Alice moaned.

Day 3

 

The team dreaded what Arthur Warren had in mind for today&#39;s bizarre 
training session. True to his word, his tasks were becoming more 
humiliating, although a handful of girls took the punishment well and 
even had a bit of fun. Yesterday, he made them maneuver through a series 
of erected poles, with a long foam tube clamped in their teeth. Everyone 
fell down at least once, but as embarrassing and unusual as it was, none 
of them were ready to give up their pride completely. To show how great 
a sport Warren was, he brought them to Parody bookstore for their next 
session, and allowed them a few moments to shop before unveiling his 
latest scheme.

&quot;With your permission, Miss Granveldt... All right, women, break&#39;s over! 
Down to the basement!&quot;

&quot;What are we doing?&quot; said Terra, who was beginning to feel homesick for 
her job. Robin gave her a sympathetic smile and joined them as they 
headed down the stairs to the large cellar. Since this was game night at 
Parody, Robin had already started setting up a few consoles. However, 
today was a special day, and instead of regular free-for-all gaming, 
Granveldt had scheduled a Dance-Dance Revolution tournament, which meant 
there would be plenty of machines open for use.

&quot;You have got to be joking me!&quot; Elisa balked. &quot;Oh, please say you&#39;re 
joking, Mr. Warren! You know I can&#39;t dance!&quot;

&quot;Then now would be a good time to learn, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; he leered. 
&quot;That&#39;s right, ladies. You&#39;re all going to play Dance-Dance Revolution 
for today&#39;s training. Divide into your teams from yesterday and get 
cracking. Miss Granveldt, I hope you brought a recorder!&quot;

&quot;And plenty of snacks!&quot; she grinned. Terra didn&#39;t mind playing this game 
in front of other people, but Fausta was another matter: she adamantly 
refused until Valencia took her aside and tried to explain.

&quot;Listen, I think Senor Warren wants us to focus on our footwork. Dancing 
has always been a great way to improve the legs; most football players 
in America take ballet just for this reason, don&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;In that case, I wish Leena had given us a ballet instructor.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be like that!&quot; she smiled, giving her a playful nudge. &quot;It&#39;s not 
every day we get to have fun like this. You should loosen up and get 
that stick out of your ass.&quot; She winked and joined her team, leaving 
Fausta to groan. It looked like she would have no choice but to get up 
there and bust a move. Not surprisingly, years of playing this game put 
Jennifer in the lead, and years of denying her skills put Elisa flat on 
her bottom more than once.

&quot;Graceful as swan,&quot; Nadia laughed as she helped her up. &quot;Make 
Baryshnikov jealous.&quot;

&quot;You are awful sometimes, you know that?&quot; she blushed. Nadia laughed 
huskily and gave her a quick kiss on the cheek to support her; Elisa&#39;s 
next attempt was considerably less gruesome.

 

Day 4

 

As if water relay races, foam tubes, and arcade dancing games weren&#39;t 
enough, Warren&#39;s next surprise was even more bizarre. He first had the 
girls take over grounds-keeping duties and mow the school lawn- with 
push-mowers- then he had them run up and down an escalator, always going 
against its flow. Once they were all thoroughly exhausted, Warren gave 
them a break and let them explore a shopping mall, but soon after, he 
threw his final wrench into their plans and forced them to race each 
other- balanced precariously atop railroad rungs.

&quot;I swear,&quot; Kasumi groaned as she was helped up from a particularly 
memorable fall, &quot;he looks like he&#39;s doing this for his personal 
amusement! I&#39;m almost twenty-one years old- I don&#39;t have to take this!&quot;

&quot;I know what&#39;cha mean, but&#39;cha gotta admit it&#39;s effective,&quot; Shannon 
said. &quot;Warren may be all nuts and no bolts, but whatevah he&#39;s got in 
mind, it&#39;s workin&#39;. Mowin&#39; the lawn gave us bettah strength and 
endurance, the escalatah helped our leg muscles, this is givin&#39; us 
bettah balance...&quot;

&quot;Okay, you&#39;ve made your point. I just hope it doesn&#39;t blow up in our 
faces when the game starts. I don&#39;t know about you...ugh...but I can&#39;t 
wait...until Leena gets back.&quot; Kasumi stretched until her sore muscles 
were soothed; a bit of tender care from Valencia helped ease the more 
stubborn joints. Frankly, she wasn&#39;t worried about the game against St. 
Jeanne, so much as the one versus St. Thekla. St. Jeanne had all-around 
talent, similar to Anolis and Lovelace, but it was a beginner team, like 
theirs, and had no noticeable advantages. Not St. Thekla, with its 
impenetrable defense and superstar goalie. Recently, Kasumi had been 
watching videos of St. Thekla&#39;s games, trying to discern any weaknesses 
that Shannon Wilson might have. If there was one, she had not noticed it 
yet.

&quot;Whoa, Earth to Kaz there.&quot; She felt her girlfriend nudging her back, 
and smiled warmly as her hand slipped to her bottom. Lately they had 
been getting more daring with each other: not just heavily making out, 
but sharing the same stall after games, getting undressed together, even 
some petting and moaning. Valencia didn&#39;t appear reluctant to go further 
and Kasumi was slowly losing whatever control she thought she had. She 
wondered if it would really be okay to start having sex now, and if not, 
what catalyst could possibly lead to it?

&quot;What&#39;s the matter, having too much fun?&quot; Valencia kissed her cheek and 
their fingers entwined.

&quot;My mind&#39;s going everywhere. You know, my dad never mentioned anything 
about my coming out in any of his letters.&quot;

&quot;Maybe he just thinks it&#39;s not a big deal.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she sighed forlornly, &quot;he didn&#39;t raise too much of a stink when 
mom left us. ...Umm, did I ever tell you about that? My parents divorced 
when I was seven, and just when I went into high school, I found out my 
mother was bisexual. Dad blew it off like it was nothing, but I&#39;ve 
always blamed my parents&#39; separation on that. I&#39;ve always felt that my 
mother&#39;s lied to us all.&quot; Valencia really didn&#39;t know what to say. She 
knew Kasumi had grown up in a single-parent household for most of her 
life, and that her relationship with her mother was strained most of the 
time, but she had been reluctant to say why. A matter like this was 
beyond her wisdom, so she decided to keep her peace and squeezed 
Kasumi&#39;s hand instead. Still.

&quot;Doesn&#39;t it bother you that you&#39;re the same way?&quot;

&quot;A little, but at least I didn&#39;t get married before I realized it. I 
want to be with someone I can be totally honest with, you know? Even to 
the end. I guess that sort of thing&#39;s going out of style, huh?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, my parents are still together.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lucky,&quot; she said. Kasumi smiled and snuck a kiss in a more 
intimate place. &quot;Okay, enough about that. Let&#39;s just prepare for 
whatever crazy scheme Mr. Warren has in mind for us next.&quot;

&quot;Nothing special, champ!&quot; he called as the ladies slipped into the cars. 
&quot;Tomorrow&#39;s the last day! After a few relays, I&#39;ll cap my fountain of 
wisdom with a good old-fashioned game of dodge ball!&quot; The reactions were 
just as mixed as their personalities; Kasumi was starting to wonder if 
facing St. Thekla&#39;s was really worse than all this.

&quot;Hang in there, everyone!&quot; Freya cheered. &quot;Only one more day before the 
big game, and two more before Leena gets back! Let&#39;s all make sure she 
knows how much we missed her!!&quot;

&quot;That won&#39;t be hard,&quot; Fleur sighed.

Day 6, Carnegie University vs. St. Jeanne&#39;s Catholic Women&#39;s College

 

Arthur Warren waited patiently outside the players&#39; locker room, 
naturally prohibited from entering due to regulations of modesty. Not 
merely content to break tradition by asking the girls to play games in 
lieu of training, he also cancelled their early morning meeting- not 
because he felt it was wrong or unnecessary, but just because he 
couldn&#39;t bring himself to wake up that early. Admittedly, most of the 
team was relieved when he made this decision; even Fausta didn&#39;t bother 
complaining. Then again, Warren was also late to the game, and didn&#39;t 
arrive until thirty minutes before it started.

&quot;I sweah, he&#39;s the most oafish and irresponsible man I&#39;ve evah met,&quot; 
Shannon grumbled as she tightened her cleats.

&quot;That&#39;s just his way,&quot; Terra said as she negotiated her sports bra. &quot;He 
may act like a buffoon, but he&#39;s a lot sharper than most people give him 
credit for. And remember what he said when he first started. We&#39;re not 
children that need someone to pamper us.&quot;

&quot;I know, but it woulda been bettah if he had come here on time.&quot;

&quot;He can&#39;t come in here anyway, so I really don&#39;t see the problem,&quot; Freya 
admitted. Nobody was surprised anymore to see her wearing the team 
uniform; that was her decision as much as anyone else&#39;s &quot;He&#39;s not Leena, 
schatz, so we shouldn&#39;t lump all these expectations on him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still worried about the game,&quot; Lauren sighed. &quot;If he had just given 
us baseball training like he normally does, we would&#39;ve been fine. I 
mean, they&#39;re awfully different sports, but they&#39;ve got a few concepts 
in common. I don&#39;t see how playing dodge ball or DDR will help us.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still a little sore from that game, too,&quot; Felicity groaned. She 
rubbed a tender spot on her forehead; Amy bent down to take a look at 
it, causing Felicity to turn pink.

&quot;Uh, yeah!&quot; Rain exclaimed. &quot;I think I got hit pretty hard too! Right on 
the thigh, see? Alice, could you take a look at it for me?&quot;

&quot;What!&quot; she shrieked. Jennifer rolled her eyes and, after assessing 
their situation, walked to the door and opened it.

&quot;You can come in now, coach,&quot; she said to Warren. &quot;We&#39;re all decent.&quot;

&quot;Ha, and you ladies call me slow. I&#39;ve known firefighters who get 
dressed quicker! It&#39;s not like you&#39;re going to Milan or anything. All 
right, let&#39;s get this show on the road.&quot; He strutted into their room, 
hands in pockets, still as unkempt as ever, and yawned twice before 
sprawling on an empty bench.

&quot;Um, coach?&quot; Freya said fretfully. Warren sat up and rubbed his neck.

&quot;God, how do you ladies do it? These things are like slabs! I&#39;d be more 
comfortable lying down on a sidewalk! Sheesh!&quot;

&quot;Coach!!&quot; she screeched. &quot;Say something! What kind of plan do you have? 
St. Jeanne&#39;s is out there waiting for us and we don&#39;t even have a 
strategy!&quot;

&quot;I thought that was your department,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Or...was it Miss 
Essylt&#39;s? I forget.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s the coach&#39;s job to organize us. Look, we all know you&#39;re 
capable of doing this! You&#39;ve run a baseball team; why not impart some 
advice here?&quot;

&quot;Advice, huh?&quot; Warren squeezed one eye shut as he rubbed his sandpapery 
cheek. The entire team leaned forward in anticipation. Surely now, at 
the final hour, he would start acting like a proper instructor. &quot;Some 
advice, you say? Well, I&#39;m not very good at passing on mantras or 
anything, and they always sound forced when I do, so...maybe something 
encouraging?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine. Just give us something to go by.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, that could work. Well then.&quot; He suddenly bolted upright and 
glowed with the light of the sun as his face burst with excitement. 
&quot;When you&#39;re all out there playing, I&#39;m going to cheer really loud!!&quot;

 

It obviously took them some time to recover from that.

 

&quot;That&#39;s...not what I meant, coach.&quot;

&quot;Well, I meant every word! Hey, it sounds like it&#39;s just about time to 
start! You ladies have got some work to do, so I&#39;ll just mosey outside 
and get outta your hair. Ciao!&quot;

&quot;Mr. Warren!!&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, good luck with your game! Remember, I&#39;m cheering loud and 
clear!&quot; Everyone growled and tried to suppress a nasty headache that had 
been irritating them all week long. Fleur took a deep breath and tried 
to stay calm. Since everything else seemed so screwed up, it only seemed 
fitting that she be the voice of reason.

&quot;Well, since Leena never told us to do our best, I guess it&#39;s only 
fitting that Mr. Warren doesn&#39;t, either. And the fact that he said he&#39;d 
be supporting us may be the best form of encouragement there is. You 
have to admit that even Leena doesn&#39;t say that very often.&quot;

&quot;At l-least n-n-not with th-that much g-gusto!&quot; Amy laughed. And so for 
the first time, the Carnegie soccer team stepped out amidst a cheering 
crowd without their Coach, without their early morning prayers, without 
the blessings of those who passed before them, and most unsettling of 
all, without any strategy or even much preparation.

&quot;And there they are,&quot; Chairman Fitzgerald observed from the stands. He 
turned to glance at Warren, who was reclining lazily, a smile of deep 
satisfaction on his face. For once the Chairman didn&#39;t bother to hide 
his disgust. &quot;Well, whatever prestige they may have boasted will surely 
be lost today. I honestly don&#39;t know what that Coach you supplanted was 
thinking, but this farce will only go to show how great a lack of 
judgment she has. Mr. Warren, sir, you are the most idiotic person I 
have ever met.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; he grumbled, sitting up briefly. &quot;Then that means... I&#39;m 
number one!!&quot; He laughed and held his finger high with pride; Fitzgerald 
covered his face in shame.

&quot;I suppose that&#39;s what I get for talking to him in the first place.&quot; 
Alice, Elisa, Valencia, Freya, and Arina nestled in the bleachers, 
feeling lonely without Leena to guide them- but a single howl from a man 
in the crowd gave them new cheer.

&quot;He certainly has the loud part down,&quot; Alice smirked.

&quot;All right, ladies! Time to strut your stuff! Hit em&#39; high, Felicity! 
Hit em&#39; hard, Kasumi! Don&#39;t give them an inch, Shannon! Or a centimeter 
in your case, Fausta!&quot;

&quot;I think he&#39;s stealing your job,&quot; Valencia grinned as she ribbed Freya. 
The blonde smiled feebly and wiped the sweat from her forehead.

&quot;He can have it. That kind of exercise is harder than it looks. You 
know, for all the sleeping and slouching he does, I have to wonder where 
he gets all that energy.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe somebody actually married him,&quot; Alice stated as 
she leaned back. The game was just now underway, and St. Jeanne&#39;s was in 
peak form. They had already made it past Jen and Fleur, and were working 
their way to the defensive midfielders.

&quot;Nadia, Rain! Do the DDR now!&quot; Warren shouted suddenly. Khovansky and 
Howlet were confused, but did as they were instructed. St. Jeanne&#39;s was 
confused by these peculiar orders, and more confused when the two ladies 
literally danced their way across the field, snatched the ball away, and 
shot it far. &quot;WAHOO, great footwork! Okay, Felicity: the pole in the 
forest! Kasumi, railroad racer!&quot;

&quot;What the devil is that fool talking about?&quot; Samuel Velur grunted. He, 
Fitzgerald, and most of the fans for St. Jeanne were stunned silent as 
they saw Felicity swerving around her opponents like a squirrel in the 
treetops, while Kasumi ran down a razor-thin with the grace of a cat. 
They carried the ball between them past the goal, running up the score 
with only five minutes on the clock.

&quot;That&#39;s the way to do it, girls!!&quot; Warren shouted. &quot;Way to go! Okay, 
Fleur, it&#39;s your turn! Mow the law, mow the lawn! Jennifer, don&#39;t just 
stand there! Escalator, now!&quot;

&quot;If you say so,&quot; Andre muttered. She surprised herself as she soared up 
the field, intercepting St. Jeanne&#39;s like a bullet train. Fleur 
practically bowled into the opposition, retrieving the ball and carrying 
it back to the center. She and Jen knocked down everything in their path 
as they blazed back to the goal, and together they put another tally on 
their board.

&quot;Wonderful! Hurry, Shannon, water relay! Just like Freya showed you! 
Nadia, Terra, water relay, hurry! Amy, DDR!&quot; The team flew into motion 
and knocked the wind out of St. Jeanne&#39;s offense. They formed a chain 
line and kept it solid, just like the water relay, always one girl 
running, intercepting, defending, and ready to fire. Terra even went so 
far as to make it to the goal line; she handed it to Nadia for another 
easy score.

&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; Elisa whispered.

&quot;I know,&quot; Valencia murmured. &quot;I just got the chills.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe those cockamamie methods of his are actually working.&quot;

&quot;Truly, his is a mind that no one could plumb the depths of,&quot; Arina 
added.

&quot;Shake it, girls! Loosen up their defenses! You didn&#39;t log all those 
hours at the mall escalator for nothing! Rain, clamp that foam tube 
hard! Don&#39;t touch any of the trees! Hey, Lauren, they&#39;re coming right 
for you! Dodge ball!&quot;

&quot;I thought the object was to dodge the- hiiiiiiieeeeeee!!! Holy shit, 
that hurts! Damn, but at least I stopped the little bastard.&quot;

&quot;Shannon, Fausta, quick recovery! You&#39;ve got a measuring cup in your 
teeth and a pool of water right in front of you!&quot; The two of them 
quickly crouched down and smacked the ball with their heads, bouncing it 
away from a puzzled St. Jeanne&#39;s and back into Nadia&#39;s care. She took 
off down the railroad, or pretended to at least, and socked it to Fleur, 
who almost gave Carnegie another point before halftime. St. Jeanne 
stopped her attack but the damage had been done: the score was 3-0 in 
Carnegie&#39;s favor.

And Helmuth Fitzgerald sat wide-eyed and pale as chalk, hands still 
folded in an unbreakable grip.

 

- Fleur Lacroix, Hair/eye color: dark brown, deep green; defensive 
midfielder-

 

Today was a day for precedents. Not only was it the first time 
Carnegie&#39;s team went without their usual coach- or their usual training 
method- or their usual pre-game meditation- but it was also the first 
time they completely shut out an opposing team, and they also entered 
their locker room without a sound. They were all stunned to total 
silence at what had transpired, and rightly so. Winning with the methods 
they had used was odd enough, but winning decisively, without their 
opponents even scoring...

&quot;No matter how many times I pinch myself or bite my tongue, the results 
are still the same,&quot; Fausta said in a hollow voice. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we 
won five to nothing. I mean, after everything we&#39;ve been through...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know whether to call it dumb luck or an act of genius,&quot; Arina 
agreed.

&quot;And did you see the Chairman&#39;s face? He looked like he just saw a 
ghost!&quot;

&quot;This victory seems oddly empty,&quot; Kasumi moaned. As everyone settled in 
and tried to accept their unusual victory, their acting coach stepped 
in, glowing with pride, still disheveled and yet strangely gallant as 
well.

&quot;Ah, basking in the glory of victory, are we? Take your time, girls! 
You&#39;ve earned every minute! And in a few short hours, I&#39;ll be outta your 
way and you&#39;ll have your regular coach back! I bet you can&#39;t wait to say 
goodbye to my sorry self!&quot; He laughed and leaned against the wall, 
digging through his jacket pockets for a cough drop. &quot;Ugh, but my throat 
is really sore. I guess all that cheering is to blame. Well, what can ya 
do? If you don&#39;t believe in your team, you&#39;re better off without a voice 
anyway! Say, anybody need one of these? I&#39;ve got lemon, peach, 
tangerine, coconut, cinnamon...&quot;

&quot;Coach, uh...&quot; Amy shyly stepped forward, smiling sheepishly as she 
wrung her hands. &quot;L-listen. I j...just want to say, on b-behalf of the 
team, that w-we&#39;re sorry if we g...g-ave you a hard time. And I&#39;m 
s-s-sorry for doubting y-you.&quot;

&quot;Doubting? Whaddya mean? All I did was cheer and make you play silly 
games. A coach is nothing but a face, someone who represents the team, 
but in the end, is completely powerless. Of course, I should be the one 
to apologize for wasting your time, but come on! It was just too much 
fun! Whelp, I&#39;ll see you all later- some of you sooner than most. 
Remember, we&#39;ve got that test on the Scandinavian conquest of Russia 
coming up! Miss Khovansky better not be the only one with an &#39;A&#39;!&quot;

He walked out of the locker room as suddenly as he came in, with more 
than one woman gawping. Nadia rubbed her face.

&quot;How can he be like that? He is too strange for me.&quot;

&quot;Like I said, dumb luck or an act of genius,&quot; Arina sighed.

&quot;I suppose even the lackadaisical can make an art out of it,&quot; Fleur said 
in resignation. As the girls got undressed and started crowding the 
showers, Amy and a handful of others thought about their mentor&#39;s 
parting words. Warren might have been a slob, a slouch, a disorganized 
slacker, and a careless, irresponsible wreck, or maybe he merely acted 
that way to make people lower their guard, to penetrate their defenses 
and cause them to expose their true selves. Perhaps he only made them do 
those exercises to see how far they were willing to go, and what they 
were willing to do. And what other reason would he have to shy away from 
the affairs of the team, other than trying to strengthen their 
independence? If that had been his idea all along, then truly, his was a 
genius that no rule could contain.

 

Even so, Leena had one hell of a welcoming.
