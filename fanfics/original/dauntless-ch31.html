<p>“Space Race: aftermath”</p>
<p>Clarissa Esriel  Astor, Director of the United Cosmic Military, skimmed through her  notes one last time, wanting to make sure she was as clear as  possible about the situation. Suicides were not uncommon following  the Space Races, if a particular gambler or business had been  especially ruined by an embarrassing loss, but they were usually  committed in private. The sudden death of subject Derian Kazcada,  successfully identified by Kyle Ozmund and military forensic  specialists, was a rare exception, and a grisly one at that, and  standard procedure demanded that an investigation follow. Due to the  bizarre circumstances leading to Derian’s demise, however, the  entire crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> was called in as a witness, as well as Mr. Ozmund and Shandra Hill,  who submitted their own reports. Astor believed she had every angle  covered, but wanted to be certain.</p>
<p>“Well, if there  is nothing left to discuss, I’d appreciate it if everyone here  leaves their signature. Your identities will remain secure and you  will not be further questioned without my authorization and your  consent. Needless to say, I’d like to keep this matter as quiet as  possible. I don’t believe I have anything else to say, so if you  feel the same…”</p>
<p>“I think that’s  everything,” Kyle said stiffly. He got up and scrawled his name  first, gave Astor a stern look, and walked away bleakly; Shandra Hill  mimed his actions to the letter and walked away in a hurry,  presumably to collect her bounty. The Director sat patiently as  everyone else stepped up to complete the process: Herut, Chandra,  Shana Suing, Valti Brignor, Riene Latoli, Kate Shepherd, Naja  Elapidae, Rebecca Hill, Eve Kasberry, Kayleigh and Teleah Acheron,  Allegra van Landingham, Lillianne Markus, Aseria Guardea Tolan, Vimmy  Fonester, Mink, Kyrie Lastgear, Yenae Marliir, Alala, Sharyn, Athena  Sifr, Fuuka Fujiwara, Lyara Tanith, and Amy Miracle. The room was  deathly silent as the women filed up and stated that “the following  is true to the best of my knowledge”; the tension was so thick that  Chandra refrained from flirting with the Director when it was her  turn. Then again, it’s not every day that you watch somebody die  like that--and to think that Derian chose to end his own life rather  than face the consequences of his actions…</p>
<p>“It’s  unfortunate this had to happen,” Clarissa stated once she acquired  the twenty-five signatures. “It truly does seem as if someone is  after you all. I’d like to tell you to…take care of yourselves  in the future, and…I’m praying for your safety, but I don’t  think you’d appreciate such empty sentiment. I am aware that some  of you have prices on your own heads, but now is not the time to be  bogged down by trivial concerns. There is a greater force at work  here, and I will do my best to commit my strength to unraveling this  mystery. You’re all free to go.</p>
<p>“Except you, Miss  Kasberry, if you don’t mind,” she pointed suddenly. The women  stopped and jerked around to ogle her, wondering just what kind of  mess their resident mechanic had gotten into. Kasberry made a face  and crossed her arms defensively.</p>
<p>“Why, am I in  trouble?”</p>
<p>“No. I’d like  to speak with you in private, please.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“I just want to  talk. I promise I’ll be civil. The rest of you, please leave us,  and thank you for your cooperation.” The crew followed her  direction and left the room, but a few couldn’t help themselves,  and called out to her teasingly.</p>
<p>“Have a nice chat  with the warden, Evie! Ooh, you’re in for it now! Don’t be  going all psycho on us now! She <em>is</em> pretty hot, Eve--maybe you’ll get lucky for once.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Aw, bite me!” At last the two women were free of company, and Eve returned to the  seat she had perched at when the interview first began. She gave the  Director an impatient glare, to which Clarissa returned with  unexpected fondness. She even <em>smiled</em> after a few seconds. For a moment, Eve really did think the older  woman was coming onto her, but her mannerisms and voice didn’t  indicate anything of the sort.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if  I’m staring, but you bear a remarkable resemblance to an old friend  of mine. Your name <em>is</em> spelled K-A-S-B-E-R-R-Y, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Evita  Elvira Kasberry, if you wanna know the whole truth.”</p>
<p>“The same as <em>Senator</em> Kasberry on Gaia?” Eve rolled her eyes in exasperation. She knew  having political connections would make her a target on Earth, but  she didn’t anticipate them following her this far.</p>
<p>“If you’re  asking if Jackson Kasberry is my father, then yes, okay? It’s the  same. What’s your point?” Clarissa smiled softly, looked away  for a moment, and tucked her report away so she wouldn’t have  anything distracting her.</p>
<p>“So I see there’s  some friction between you two.”</p>
<p>“Get to the  fucking point!” Eve shouted, vaulting out of her chair. “Okay,  you wanna know about our relationship? Fine! My father was some  fucking isolationist Senator who used every dirty trick to keep  foreigners out of his backyard and gold in his wallet. He didn’t  like people from other planets or even other countries, and he  influenced <em>me</em> so much with his fucking close-minded shit that I’ve ended up  turning into a miserable, lonely little misanthrope! God damn, I  hate that man. If he didn’t have papers with DNA evidence on them,  I’d swear he wasn’t my real father. If you want, we can get into  my stepmother, but I think I’ve pissed you off enough. Can we get  to the friggin’ point?”</p>
<p>By all rights,  Clarissa should have been a shaking, fuming powder keg ready to  explode. She already had people out looking for this woman, and Eve  certainly wasn’t making things easier for herself by ranting so  furiously. Instead, Astor laughed quite graciously, and invited her  guest to sit back down.</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’m  sorry. You just reminded me of that same person again.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“You’re right,  I should focus on why I asked you to stay behind. There are two  things I’d like to discuss with you, and familial relationships is  one of them. We’ve covered that quite well, so we’ll just put it  to the side for now. I want to ask you one more time if you’d be  willing to come back to work for us.”</p>
<p>“The answer’s  no,” she grunted, “always and forever, and if you keep pissing me  off with the same question, I really <em>will</em> start to hate the military! I’d rather start my own small business  and fail than become a nameless cog in your grand design.” Once  again, Clarissa kept her composure, but now she seemed to soften even  more, and her face glowed with a warm expression.</p>
<p>“Just the way she  would answer,” she murmured. “Let me change the subject for  awhile. I have a sheet here--somewhere--that says you lived at  Hallow’s Point for a few years--the satellite colony around  Silvanus. Would you be okay telling me what you did there?” At  the mention of her first home away from home, Eve relaxed and even  released a humble smile. She had very fond memories of Hallow’s  Point and was glad the Director was finally talking about something  pleasant.</p>
<p>“I learned the  tricks of my trade there. I found this really eccentric mechanic who  took me under her wing, and she taught me everything I know. She had  a husband, too--and kids </p>
<p>around my age. They  were like family to me, in a way. That was probably the happiest  I’ve ever been. Of course, I also got into a little accident while  I was there, and I guess you could say I lost a piece of myself. There’s not a doubt in my mind that the old lady’s alive--hell,  the whole universe could explode, and she’d just kick back and  laugh right in its face.”</p>
<p>“She sounds like  a wonderful mentor,” Clarissa emphasized. Eve smiled fondly and  sighed.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I should  go back there one of these days, just to give that stinker a heart  attack. Why are you asking me about this, anyway?” Clarissa  chuckled and said to never mind.</p>
<p>“I was just  curious. Was your mentor’s name, by any chance, Carlisle  Renchina?” Eve sat bolt upright and stared so hard that she almost  pushed Astor away through sheer amazement.</p>
<p>“Yeah! How the  hell did you know that, anyway?”</p>
<p>“She’s the  friend I mentioned to you earlier,” Clarissa laughed. “She had a  nickname, too: ‘the Wrench’, but she hated being called that. Ahh…just talking about it really takes me back.”</p>
<p>“Unreal!” Eve  proclaimed, now flopping back into her chair. It was utterly  inconceivable that the Director of the galaxy enlisted forces would  know someone living on a backwater colony like that. Clarissa’s  smile became a little more serious as she folded her hands, wanting  to prepare Eve for the true reason she had asked her there.</p>
<p>“In any case, now  that I’ve heard your decision, I’d like to leave you with two  bits of knowledge. The first is the knowledge that you are granted  your freedom. I’ll lift the bounty on your head and call off all  searches. I don’t wish to lose someone with so much potential,  especially if she was taught by my old friend, but if I forced you  into it, I’d only be betraying the beliefs <em>she</em> stood for, and I’d never be able to look her in the face again if I  did.”</p>
<p>“Nice!” Eve  grinned. “About time you people got the message! I guess this  means I can’t hate you anymore!”</p>
<p>“I’m  glad to  hear that. The second bit of information might be harder to swallow.  You already told me about your father, but you didn’t say much  about your mother.”</p>
<p>“She’s my  stepmother,” Eve corrected, “and there’s not a whole lot to  say. She’s not exactly the epitome of motherhood, and sometimes  she can be scum, too, but I’d say she’s the lesser of two evils.”</p>
<p>“I meant your  mother--your biological mother, the woman who gave birth to you.” Eve snorted and shoved her hands in her pockets.</p>
<p>“Pssh! Who, her? Damned if I know. My father never told me. He’d always point to  his wife and say, ‘<em>this</em> is your mother, Evita, and that’s all you need to know!’ I gave  up trying to find her a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“What if I told  you I knew who she was?” Clarissa asked. Eve stopped to think for  a moment, rolled her eyes, and got out of her seat.</p>
<p>“Lemme guess: another friend I resemble, right?”</p>
<p>“You could say  that.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah? Who?”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“So what did she  say?” asked Quincy Winchester as she and Eve laid naked in their  bed, </p>
<p>cuddling happily  after another thrilling episode of lovemaking. Quincy laughed and  kissed Eve’s naked shoulder, biting very gently. “She didn’t  tell you <em>she</em> was your mother, I hope!”</p>
<p>“No! The  Director’s only 44. She would’ve been seventeen at the time.”</p>
<p>“So? That’s  old enough for most humans to have kids.”</p>
<p>“She doesn’t  have any children. I don’t even think she has family.” Quincy  playfully rolled Eve on her back and hovered over her, breasts  swaying hypnotically.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at  me either, princess! I’m only seven years older than you.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say  that!” Eve guffawed, swatting her face gently. Winchester lived up  to her name, the Jackal, as she swooped down and gnawed at Eve’s  collarbone lustfully; Kasberry squealed and soon started to moan as  her lover penetrated her, gently and lovingly just as Eve had hoped  she would.</p>
<p>“So who is it,  then? Don’t keep me in suspense, lovely.” Eve glanced up  skeptically and grinned.</p>
<p>“It was my old  boss! Can you believe it?! That’s just as crazy as your first  suggestion! I mean, sure, Carly was <em>like</em> a mother to me, but there’s no way we’re related! That woman was  whacked off her military gourd.”</p>
<p>“Probably,”  Quincy purred. “But it sounds romantic to me.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like  idealistic bullshit. There’s no way I have a real family out  there--and if Carly <em>was</em> my mother, she would’ve told me! I was just an apprentice to  her--well, maybe a friend, too. But there’s no way.” Quincy  smiled sadly, caressed Eve’s face, and bent down to kiss her  tenderly. She knew better than to push the subject, so they just had  sex again, and slept cuddled close together, wanting to believe that  they were really in love. A few minutes after midnight passed, the  Jackal quietly slipped away from her beloved’s arms and went to  attend her toilet. Since she was up, she decided to make a call, so  she grabbed her cell phone and a robe, and stepped outside to feel  the cool night air dancing on her skin. She only needed to wait for  one dial tone before the line was picked up.</p>
<p>“What is it you  want?”</p>
<p>“I noticed your  emissary failed in his mission. I also noticed he committed a  serious <em>faux  pas</em> and betrayed your trust in him.”</p>
<p>“His life was  completely meaningless, and whatever drawbacks we may suffer due to  his incompetence can be easily mended. He was a fingernail that was  cut off, nothing more. I will refer back to my opening question: what is it you want?”</p>
<p>“To offer a deal,  of course. I can give you the exact location of the Dead Roses, if  you still want to find them, and all I ask is the usual fee. Wasn’t  it nice of Mr. Kazcada to neglect his mission earlier? Why, if he  had succeeded, you wouldn’t need <em>me</em>,  would you Mr. Nephele?”</p>
<p>“You  certainly  live up to your reputation,” he commented with a sliver of respect.  “What a pity that I must rely on you for this information, Miss  Jackal. Very well--tell me what you know. I assure you, though, we  shall never require your services concerning these pirates after  today.”</p>
<p>“I hope you’re  wrong!” she snickered, and revealed the location of the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>. After reaching an understanding, they both hung up and she put her  phone away. Gentle arms embraced her from behind, and the Jackal  sighed in content as Eve leaned up to kiss her neck.</p>
<p>“What are you  doing here, and what’s with the clothes?” Quincy grinned and  turned around, discovering her lover wasn’t quite as discreet about  her nudity as she was.</p>
<p>“I just needed  some fresh air. Some asshole called my number, too, so I gave him a  piece of my mind. I didn’t mean to wake you, sweetheart.” Eve  giggled and stealthily untied the older </p>
<p>woman’s robe; she  let it drop and the Jackal hummed sweetly as a cool breeze kissed her  naked body.</p>
<p>“Mmm, come to bed  and forget about that. It’s lonely and cold just laying there by  myself.”</p>
<p>“I’ll make it  up to you somehow,” she purred.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  back on  the ship, Herut observed Shana Suing work with quiet fascination. Most  people just saw her as a cute, petite, precocious artist, but  Shana was dangerously sharp when properly motivated, and attacked a  puzzle like a shark overpowering its helpless prey. Combining a  nearly flawless memory with an insatiable thirst for  challenges—rolling it all into a deceptively adorable package—Shana  could be called the trump card of the <em>Dauntless</em>,  and Herut admired her deeply. But she also liked Shana as a friend,  because no matter how advanced the little lady got, she still managed  to brighten other people’s days and find amusement in the smallest,  silliest, slightest things.</p>
<p>She was trying to  figure out what sort of connection Derian had with the <em>Dauntless</em>,  and who his masters might be, and what the significance or meaning of  “Origin” was. Shana knew all the obvious connections and kept  them written down on a separate data sheet, sometimes referring back  to it when she made another breakthrough. Herut just happened to be  in the area, taking a well-earned break from repairing the ship (most  of the work was done by a professional pit crew), and decided to stop  by for a closer look. One of the things she liked about her friend  was that Shana was never too busy to greet people; she highlighted  her place and gave Herut a horrifyingly sweet smile.</p>
<p>“Hi there! Wanna  come sit next to me? I think I’m on the verge of another  breakthrough.” Herut felt honored by the invitation and pulled up  a chair; she immediately noticed that Shana was wearing a fragrant  perfume that could only be noticed by someone if they were very  close. Most people had to remind themselves that this was an adult  woman, and a very mature one as well; she just had a bounce in her  step as well. Herut didn’t require this reality check and simply  thought of Miss Suing as an equal, and a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>“What do you have  so far?”</p>
<p>“Well,  Kyrie  already explained that she never heard about Mr. Kazcada prior to  enrollment, and from what I’ve been able to gather, his motive for  destroying us had nothing to do with her family or their inventions. It  was completely coincidental that they were the same race. However,  thanks to Miss Latoli’s help, I’ve been able to find  something about his employer—or master, whichever you prefer. Remember  at the beginning of the race, when they announced that  someone called Nemo Nephele was sponsoring him? Those words  translate as ‘nothing’ and ‘cloud’. Since those are words  from the Gaean languages, I’ve theorized that our adversary may be  based on Helios 3, but it could just as easily be a red herring. If  Kazcada’s sponsor really wanted to remain hidden, he or she  would’ve chosen a much more obscure language to draw names from. They  wouldn’t be anonymous, because that draws too <em>much</em> attention.” Herut smiled and shook her head in amazement.</p>
<p>“You’re  brilliant, you know that?”</p>
<p>“Not really!”  Shana exclaimed cheerily. “I had lots of help. You could say I’m  only connecting the dots. I also have a theory that claims Kazcada  has a connection with the Nurogrim race, the Rennai penal colonists,  and the Elshyrin, due to how brazen they were when he attacked us  that one time. Also, when Chandra got back from her date with  Captain </p>
<p>Chuunaru, I asked  her if she picked up any information concerning that dogfight the <em>Backdraft</em> orchestrated.”</p>
<p>“I can guess  where that conversation went,” Herut mumbled. Shana giggled and  shuffled her files around so a new set of notes were on top.</p>
<p>“Well, I didn’t  get a whole lot, but she did mention that Captain Chuunaru was  involved. Apparently, Kazcada’s also got issues with the Dead  Roses, so we’re not the only victims here.”</p>
<p>“Maybe they  deserved it,” Herut shrugged. “After all, they are pirates.”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm, I put  that into consideration as well. I wanted to interview Miss Rose,  but it seems she’s already left the planet. I guess she didn’t  want to give her antagonists an unnecessary head start. Anyway, I’ve  been looking into this ‘Origin’ that Kazcada mentioned, but I  haven’t been able to find anything. Dr. Miracle’s even looking  through the Tome of Treasures, and I’ve asked everyone on the ship  except you.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help  you there,” Herut sighed. Shana chuckled warmly and reached out  for her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I  didn’t expect to solve anything right away. We’re just not in  total darkness anymore, that’s all. Would you like to help me  research?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” she  grinned. Herut liked Shana; she felt more human around her; she even  considered her the closest friend she had. Before the  gold-and-green-eyed girl could stand, Herut impulsively leaned close  and kissed her lips: it was something she had wanted to try and  discover for awhile now. Her actions were clumsy and inexperienced,  but Shana didn’t retract or make Herut feel any worse for her  decision. It was her first kiss, too.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she  grinned bashfully, “I just wanted to see why Chandra finds it so  stimulating.”</p>
<p>“And?” Shana  whispered. Herut’s deep brown eyes glimmered as her cheeks turned  rosy.</p>
<p>“Um…I liked it. Don’t tell her I was curious, okay?”</p>
<p>“Okay!” she  laughed—before scooting closer to return the favor. Shana was just  as awkward and uncertain, but in her innocence, she could pour purity  into her works, and her pure love for Herut became evident as the  other girl closed her eyes, cradled Shana’s head, and gasped  quietly as they both accustomed themselves to this new sensation.</p>
<p>“Did you like  that too?” Shana whispered shyly. Herut blushed and nodded  sweetly. There was a little trail of saliva connecting their lips.</p>
<p>“Yeah. So…are  we going to study or kiss?”</p>
<p>“I don’t see  why we can’t do both!” she giggled.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Kaori Chuunaru  liked her date with Chandra so much that she arranged another one  before leaving. Their last meeting had been a bit too passionate and  personal for Kaori’s novice tastes: they had danced together at  the zero-g ball, and Chandra made every attempt possible to sneak  ghostly kisses whenever possible. She had touched Kaori’s hands,  her waist, and even the small of her back with seasoned intimacy, and  later proved just how good she was with her hands by giving the older  woman a massage. Kaori knew she needed one—life in the military  was stressful, and it made her muscles sore and joints stiff—and  she felt like butter underneath the </p>
<p>caring touches of  the ochre-skinned goddess. Chandra even snuck a kiss in, placing her  lips upon Kaori’s mouth and finalizing Chuunaru’s deeply-buried  sexuality. She called an end to their first date prematurely, out of  fear and duty—she had no idea where Chandra meant for the evening  to go, and was frightened of the possibilities.</p>
<p>But the second date  put her more at ease. They had dinner by a beautiful Centanian lake,  went for a boat ride, and even attempted to paint together. Kaori  was surprised by how romantic Chandra could be, and wondered if this  was really “just” a pleasure unit, or a real woman falling in  love. She had seen how lustful these models could be and shunned  them as abominations, but this one seemed different—more genuine,  maybe. Whoever gave her new life must’ve certainly loved his or  her work (Kaori theorized it was a man, since Chandra only seemed  interested in women). They ended their day by taking a walk around  the lake, holding hands, forgetting about the world outside their  idyllic umbrella. Chandra stopped her once to deliver a deep kiss,  and was mildly surprised as Kaori nestled her soft moist tongue  through her lips, exploring the insides of her mouth. The biggest  disappointment was being forced to cut their evening short: Chandra  wanted to make sweet blissful love to this woman, and even Chuunaru  toyed with the idea. But in the end, one was a lesbian pleasure  unit, and the other was a Captain in the United Military. They would  probably not see each other again.</p>
<p>“I’d like to  see a lot more of you,” Sati Yeriman said as she caressed Riene’s  face. Just hearing those words sent her heart soaring, even though  she preferred they come from Rebecca’s lips. “I know we’ll  have our own things once we leave, but I’d like to make some effort  to meet up with you. I’m really quite smitten with you.”</p>
<p>“You’re so  sweet to say things like that,” Riene chuckled. “I’m not  accustomed to being romanced. I’m afraid I’m going about it the  wrong way.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re  doing fine. Anyway, I’ve been thinking. I’d like to be your  girlfriend—you know, make a steady relationship out of this. But  I’d also like you to be my partner.”</p>
<p>“Your partner?”  Riene’s eyes glowed quizzically; that one word could mean anything.</p>
<p>“Yeah, travel the  galaxy with me, meet interesting people, go to strange places, that  sort of deal. I’m not saying you should commit to anything now,  because of what you’re doing, but…give it some time. When you’re  ready to make a decision, meet me on the dark side of Selena. I’ll  be over there in about a month, so take your time.” Riene nodded  absently, and drew closer as Satine kissed her. Their parting  embrace was too brief; Riene wished it could go on and on. Her skin  danced ecstatically as Sati made a trail down her neck and ended at  her shoulder; she pulled the other woman back up, kissed her firmly,  and let her go, silently promising she would think about her answer.</p>
<p><em>Let’s  make a deal, Riene: if by the time a month passes by and you’re no  closer to Rebecca—closer in any way, shape, or form at all—I  mean, if it looks like there’s no hope at all—then you should  accept her offer. I would only be lying to myself if I stayed after  that. Besides, it’s not like you have anything else keeping you  here, and you </em><em><u>did</u></em><em> want to explore and all that. I wonder if anybody will miss me.</em></p>
<p>She grinned at  Rebecca and even made direct eye contact as she boarded the ship,  just to test the waters, and noticed the younger woman smiling  bashfully as she looked away. If only Riene knew just how furiously  Miss Hill’s heart was beating at the time, she would already have  her answer.</p>
<p>Once everyone had  said their farewells to old friends and new faces, the crew of  twenty-four packed themselves into the vessel, ready to head for new  horizons. The Space Race had </p>
<p>been  an entertaining  and educational distraction (though it became gruesome at the end),  but now it was finally time to return to their normal schedule:  searching the galaxy for treasures, and experiencing everything the  great heavenly unknown had to offer. Next stop: Saigrim!</p>
<p>“And it’s about  time,” Naja huffed.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“She’s late  again,” Patches commented as she brought more supplies onto the  ship.</p>
<p>“Rose is always  the last one to board—you know that,” her sister said.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but why is  it that every time <em>we’re</em> late, she tans our hides?”</p>
<p>“Maybe the  Captain wants us to set a higher standard,” Duchess suggested. “Or  maybe she’s just twisted that way.”</p>
<p>“Rose does enjoy  giving a good spanking,” Henrietta grunted, setting down four bags. Not all the pirates were on the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> just yet: some were still scrounging for supplies, bribing race  officials, gathering information, or (as it was in the Captain’s  case) concluding a romantic conquest. They were scheduled to leave  in an hour, but not even Duchess was that punctual, so they didn’t  expect to really set sail for at least ninety minutes. That would  give everyone plenty of time to load the ship up, say their  farewells, and maybe sneak in a “quickie” if they were quiet  about it. Since Duchess was frailer than most of her mates, she kept  a tally of the items coming in and made sure every woman checked in,  so they wouldn’t leave anybody behind (it only happened once, but  it left a very profound impact on the poor girl, and Rose had sharply  implemented the system ever since). As the crew worked hard to fill  the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> with necessities and goodies, Duchess spotted an unfamiliar person  approaching the ship. She jumped down from her perch, drew her  sword, and smiled bittersweetly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but  only a member of the Dead Roses can come aboard. I’m afraid that  if you don’t have an invitation or the Captain’s permission, we  will have to ask you—“</p>
<p>Duchess never spoke  again as the stranger sliced her head clean off in one stroke.</p>
<p>“Holy  mother-fucker!” Women started screaming and yelling brutally as  their beloved helmswoman tumbled to the floor, and they swarmed the  invader like a horde of berserkers, blind with rage. The intruder  waded into their ranks, hacking and slashing with merciless  brutality, slaughtering everyone in sight. The pirates quickly fell  back, shocked at his amazing strength, and a roar of gunfire sounded  off as Henrietta led the next wave. She pointed her machine-gun leg  directly at the killer, but felt her blood run cold as he stood  there, absorbing the torrent, hardly even flinching. Henrietta  roared and ran in to blast him at point-blank range: she buried her  artificial leg into his crotch and emptied her supply. His eyes  merely squeezed in annoyance before he cut off her other leg,  flinging her to the ground. Henrietta screamed once before her voice  was cut off: his sword went right through her head.</p>
<p>“YOU SON OF A  BITCH!!” The man stood with lifeless eyes and a dull, kingly face  as Patches and Natalie charged at him. They threw knives, tomahawks,  and even grenades at him, but nothing seemed to work. The weapons  remained buried in his body, like he was a living </p>
<p>pincushion, and he  waited patiently as they slowed their attack, and gazed at each other  in horrible realization. Quick as a flash, the unknown assassin  dashed after the sisters, running Natalie through before slamming  Patches against the floor, so hard that her spine shattered and her  skull cracked instantly. A fatally wounded woman, her trademark  nudity glossy with her own blood, reached out to her dear sister, her  fierce rival, her treasured friend, her passionate lover, and smiled  as her life came to an end.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t so  bad…was it, Patty?”</p>
<p>The man continued  his patient, unstoppable rampage, killing everyone in his way. He  took care of the main deck before diving down into the lower  quarters, and here was where he met the greatest resistance. Torch  had scrambled deep into the weapons storage room and was preparing  for a last-ditch effort when the assassin came her way. She kicked  down a door, rolled out a large cannon, straddled it, and waved her  trademark blowtorch in the air. The nozzle was pointing right at his  torso.</p>
<p>“Say hello to my  little friend!” The explosion knocked the man back, carving  shrapnel and steel and fire into his body; he crashed against the  ship’s wall, splintering wood and dislocating boards. The impact  actually made the entire ship tremble, and Torch kicked her weapon  like a horse, yawping triumphantly. Six seconds after the dust  cleared, however, the man slowly climbed up from the rubble, unfazed  and unharmed, and stepped over to meet his assailant as if he had  years to kill her.</p>
<p>“You’re KIDDING  me!” she roared. The man shook his head calmly, and carved her  body in half with one blow. Inevitably, the rest of the pirates  fell, regardless of the fight they put up. Some were cut apart, or  stabbed, or decapitated; others were smashed against the ship, flung  around by tremendously powerful arms. A few tried to run—not out  of cowardice, but hopelessness and fear—and one or two escaped, but  the warrior caught most of them, and executed them on the spot. One  hour after Duchess first spotted him in the distance, the invincible  assassin had killed nearly every crewmember of the <em>Bloody  Dove</em>;  he had hardly spared a single soul.</p>
<p>As he climbed back  to the deck, he saw the Captain, her face pallid beyond the spectrum  of color, sweat trickling down her skin as her legs and arms shivered  uncontrollably. Rose had seen countless horrors in her day and had  been able to laugh at them all, but this… It was not merely  horrific, but nightmarish, atrocious…and unforgivable. Rose  abandoned reason for revenge, and charged at the assassin with all  her fury, burying her sword in his belly up to the hilt. He jerked  faintly, grunted, and stared deep into her oceanic eyes—not out of  hatred or spite, but pure, absolute apathy. They were the eyes of a  noble king, the eyes of a wise sailor, the windows of a man who had  no soul, and they were darker and more ominous and more engrossing  than anything Rose had ever seen before. She felt like a child  standing next to an Emperor.</p>
<p>“So it’s true,”  she whispered in awe. “The legends are true. You do exist.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Rose  stepped back humbly as the man took her sword in his hands, twisted  it, and slowly lifted it up—not out, but <em>up</em>,  like you would slice through jelly. The blade passed through his  chest, beyond his neck, and slowly—Rose felt like vomiting at this  point—up through his head, until it came out of his scalp, and he  handed it back to her.</p>
<p>“Take  it,” he  said. “You’ve earned the right to die with it in your hands.” Rose  shakily grabbed her sword, hugged it close, and collapsed on the  ground, grief-stricken and scared beyond mortal comprehension. She  felt his sword go through her body, fluidly as if she were made of  butter, and wept as he took the helm. The <em>Bloody  Dove</em> slowly took off, guided by a </p>
<p>master navigator,  and left Centania for the distant black shores.</p>
<p>“Where the hell  are you taking us?” she groaned.</p>
<p>“To  the star of  this system,” he answered. “I will guide this vessel into the  eternal flames, where your crew and your ship shall not be defiled. I  believe it is a proper ending for our kind.” Rose glanced at her  crew, wincing whenever she moved, and slumped her head in morose  relief.</p>
<p>“Yeah… So who  sent you? I think I have the right to know, before I go up in  flames.”</p>
<p>“That you do,  Captain Rose. An entity named Boole was the one who commissioned me  for this task, but the one who pointed me in your direction was a  person called Jackal.” Rose suddenly revived and stood up to her  full height, leaking red humours everywhere. Even with pain shooting  through her body and the assassin’s sword still lodged inside her,  she had strength enough for shock and rage.</p>
<p>“Did you say the  Jackal?! Do you mean Quincy Winchester?!”</p>
<p>“I was not given  any other name.” Her mouth hung open, and she sat down again,  stunned.</p>
<p>“So, she really  did betray me in the end. That heartless, wicked monster… I  promise you, Jackal, I will haunt you from Hell for the rest of  eternity! Everything I have suffered today will be returned a  hundred fold when we meet at Lucifer’s throne! By my own blood,  and the blood of my fallen comrades…”</p>
<p>She became silent,  and said no more. The man patiently guided the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> towards her fiery demise, and jumped out before the ship was sucked  into its gravity and was instantly consumed. Now all he had to do  was wait for someone to find him and pick him up, so he crossed his  arms and studied the cosmos, patient as time itself. Barbarossa, the  immortal Captain of the infamous <em>Flying  Dutchman</em>,  had been alive for over a thousand years; spending a few hours  drifting through the heavens wouldn’t inconvenience him at all.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Valti: Ah, so we’re  finally headed to Saigrim, are we? What were we going there for,  again?</p>
<p>Eve: I think to get  some nail that Naja wanted.</p>
<p>Valti: Oh yeah, I  remember now! She said she wants to use it to break out of her  marriage contract!</p>
<p>Allegra: If she  wanted to do that, she should’ve just asked my advice! Lady van  Landingham could’ve given her a few pointers…</p>
<p>Eve: Well, you’d  think that someone as repulsive as Naja wouldn’t <em>have</em> a fiancé.</p>
<p>Allegra: It just  goes to show that there’s somebody out there for everyone.</p>
<p>Valti: Even <em>me?!</em></p>
<p>Allegra: …Almost  everyone.</p>
<p>Valti: You’re  mean!</p>
<p>Eve: Hopefully  we’ll get back on track in the next chapter, but only time will  tell. With this crew, there’s a distraction every day!</p>

<p>Eve: … (nervous  tic)</p>
<p>Valti: What?</p>
<p>Eve: No,  Valti—just…no, okay?</p>
