<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 11 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Kris was awoken by her alarm. She peered around in search of where the 
sound could be coming from. Moving a couple of books she found the 
infernal clock and hit the snooze button, rolled over and looked up at 
the ceiling. She felt her body shiver as she recalled the night&#39;s 
dreams. Again her night was haunted by Jennifer&#39;s last days. It was 
almost like she didn&#39;t want Kris to forget. The alarm again startled 
Kris out of her musing, forcing her to finally face the day. She shut 
off the clock this time, then got up to go about her morning activities. 

Still half asleep she grabbed herself a clean bowl from the dish rack. 
Why put the dishes away when she was the only one who lived there? She 
filled the bowl with cereal, added milk, found herself a spoon, then 
started wandering around the apartment preparing for the day ahead. 

She looked down at her clothes that still lay on the floor outside of 
the bathroom in a heap and kicked it into the corner. Today, she 
decided, she was going to try something different. She set her bowl on a 
chair and opened the closet to see what she could find. For the most 
part she only had  a few clothes, a blazer for family gatherings, some 
dress shirts and silk tops along with many t-shirts. She took out a pair 
of black slacks and set them off to the side. Then she ventured over to 
her dresser where she hid the clothes she felt the most comfortable in, 
but didn&#39;t like wearing in public. She sifted through the clothes until 
she could find a clean pair of underwear, bra and socks, then ran out of 
the room to scoop the shirt she found the other night off the ground 
next to the futon where she left it.

She first bandaged her arm better before pulling on her dress shirt and 
loosely hung a tie around her neck, then pulled on her slacks not 
bothering to tuck the shirt in.  She grabbed her cereal, looked herself 
over in the mirror one last time while she finished off the last of the 
bowl. She briefly fought to fix her hair before dropping the bowl in the 
kitchen sink and quickly running a toothbrush across her teeth then ran 
out the door. She didn&#39;t get far down the road before running into 
Tanya.

&quot;Hey there sexy!&quot; Tanya called out when she saw her friend walking down 
the street with her hands in her pockets, &quot;Aren&#39;t you looking sharp. I 
haven&#39;t seen you dressed like that in ages. What is the occasion?&quot; Tanya 
asked giving the girl a nudge. 

&quot;Nothing special.&quot; Kris mused out loud with a shrug, &quot;I just felt like 
trying something different.&quot;

&quot;Well it is good to see the old Kris back.&quot; Tanya smiled happily, &quot;I 
liked the &#39;Charming Kris&#39; better then &#39;Deep and Depressing Kris.&#39;&quot; 

&quot;Who said I was out to charm anyone?&quot; Kris asked eyeing her friend 
suspiciously. 

&quot;Whenever you dress like that you are out to cause some girl some heart 
ache.&quot; Tanya ascertained with a sly smile, &quot;And you know it.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what you are talking about.&quot; Kris replied turning away 
from her friend, &quot;I&#39;m just here to study and that is it.&quot; She firmly 
stood her ground on the issue.

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Tanya nodded not believing a word her friend said, &quot;You just 
keep trying to convince yourself.&quot; 

Kris glared at Tanya, &quot;I&#39;m telling you the truth. I just felt more 
comfortable in these clothes. Will you stop thinking I&#39;m up to something 
when I&#39;m not.&quot;

Tanya raised her hands in defence, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I was just joking 
around.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m not in the mood right now.&quot; Kris snarled. The truth was she 
was hoping that she would sleep off the feelings from yesterday, however 
she could not get her mind off Jenn&#39;s first kiss and this was causing 
her a load of problems. She truly thought she was only dressing 
comfortably, but the more Tanya pushed the more she wondered if the girl 
was right. Tanya knew her better then she knew herself and that bothered 
her at times.  

As they approached the school a small group of girls rushed up to Kris, 
&quot;There she is! I told you she is cute.&quot; One of them squealed.

&quot;I love the tie!&quot; Another one chirped.

&quot;Kris can you sing for me?&quot; Yet another pleaded.

Kris set a hand on her head. What had she gotten herself into? Why did 
she have to sing in the middle of the hall? She felt overwhelmed by the 
girls as they surrounded her. One tried to touch her arm and Kris pulled 
away quickly. 

&quot;Okay,&quot; Tanya got between Kris and the girls, &quot;Kris has a head ache 
today and needs some space so why don&#39;t you try another day.&quot; She told 
them with a mischievous grin. The girls all moaned in disappointment, 
but they at least understood. They all gave Kris their regards before 
running off to their individual classes.

&quot;You&#39;ve become very popular, haven&#39;t you?&quot; Someone sweet-talked from 
behind Kris.

Kris didn&#39;t turn around. Somehow she already knew it was Sarah and she 
couldn&#39;t look the girl in the eye. Not this morning at least. &quot;Well, 
who&#39;s fault is that? I seem to remember some girl begging to hear me 
sing in a stairwell the other day.&quot;

Sarah appeared at Kris&#39;s side with her arms crossed, &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t beg. 
I just asked. It isn&#39;t my fault you have such a cute voice.&quot; She tried 
to see Kris in the eye, but the girl&#39;s eyes where half closed and 
looking at the ground. 

Kris started to move toward the school, &quot;Yeah, well... don&#39;t ask again, 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Alright, I promise.&quot; 

&quot;So you are the infamous girl she sung to?&quot; Tanya piped all of a sudden. 
A grin broadened across the girl&#39;s face as she looked Sarah over. 

&quot;Infamous?&quot; Sarah asked curiously, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Kris tried hard to ignore both of the girls, wishing they would leave 
her alone. The memory of that kiss was not helping much either and it 
was beginning to drive her nuts. So Kris decided that for today she 
would try to avoid any girl that approached her. &quot;Listen, could you not 
talk to me today. I&#39;m... not feeling well.&quot; It was a lame excuse and she 
knew it, but she couldn&#39;t think of anything better, &#39;Stay away from me 
or I might kiss you.&#39; just didn&#39;t have the right ring to it. 

Sarah put her hand on Kris&#39;s forehead testing the girl&#39;s temperature, 
&quot;You feel fine to me.&quot; She established smiling. 

The feeling of Sarah&#39;s hand against Kris&#39;s skin caused a shiver rush 
through her body and quickly pulled away from the girl, &quot;Don&#39;t&quot; was all 
she could muster. 

Tanya laughed from behind her, &quot;You two seem rather close.&quot; She coughed 
through chuckles. 

&quot;Tanya will you cut it out?&quot; Kris pleaded, her head was feeling like it 
was about to split and the one things she didn&#39;t need right now is a 
fight between two of her friends, &quot;She is just a new
friend. Nothing more.&quot; 

&quot;Is that so?&quot; Tanya looked Kris in the eye, &quot;You certain there isn&#39;t 
anything more?&quot; 

&quot;More?&quot; Sarah stared bewildered at the two girls, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 
She asked innocently. 

Tanya blinked at the girl in disbelief, &quot;You really don&#39;t know?&quot; 

&quot;Will you shut up!&quot; Kris snapped and stormed off towards the school. 
Kris could not believe Tanya, &#39;What was she thinking she was doing?&#39; 
Kris thought to herself, &#39;Trying to destroy her first new friendship 
since Jennifer&#39;s death?&#39; She grumbled to herself as she stomped down the 
halls. 

Kris entered the class and flopped her desk. She panted, trying to 
control her emotions. Already she could feel this was going to be a long 
day. She sensed someone approaching and stop at her desk. She looked up 
to see Jason standing overhead and let out a deep sigh. &quot;I&#39;m really not 
in the mood today so if you could say whatever it is that is on your 
mind quickly so we can all get on with our lives, that would be great.&quot; 
She started to pull out her note pad and pencils as she spoke. 

Jason just stood there stumped. &quot;Nice tie.&quot; He said coldly, then turned 
and left Kris alone. 

Kris let go of the breath she was holding. She couldn&#39;t believe what she 
just did and was even more surprised by what Jason said. She opened her 
eyes and saw Sarah standing in the door watching Jason, she gave Kris a 
small smile as their eyes met for the first time that day, then walked 
to her desk. Again Kris felt her heart begin to race, so she quickly 
looked down at her sketchbook and tried to clear her mind of anything, 
but the pencil in her hand. 

Art class could not have gone by faster. The entire time she was plagued 
by the dreams she had the other night and the longing to be held again. 
She found it hard not to glance at Sarah from time to time during class. 
She felt an urge to draw the girl. To memorize her features, however 
stopped herself. The hour dragged on with Kris battling with her senses. 
Soon enough the bell rang and all Kris could think was &quot;One down 3 more 
to go.&quot; She looked at a copy of her schedule that she stuck in her 
binder to see what was next and hit her head on her desk. 

Sarah hugged her sketchbook as she cautiously approached Kris who was 
rolling her head back and forth on her desk. &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She 
asked. 

Kris stopped rolling her head so she could look in the girl&#39;s direction, 
just not enough to see her face. &quot;Oh, I&#39;m just fine. I&#39;d be better if we 
didn&#39;t have gym class next.&quot; She let out another deep sigh. All she 
needed today is to have to see a bunch of girls changing. This was 
wreaking havoc on her nerves and she couldn&#39;t say a thing about it 
because she was afraid of what everyone would think. 

Sarah watched as everyone began to shuffle out of the room toward the 
gym. &quot;I know what you mean. I hate gym class too.&quot;

Kris sat up and looked at the girl, thinking. &#39;How could you know how I 
feel? It&#39;s not like you are the one cursed after all.&#39; was what she 
wanted to say.

Sarah looked down at Kris, &quot;Well, we&#39;d better get going or we&#39;ll be 
late.&quot; She picked up her backpack and started towards the door. 

Kris slowly gathered her things and walked behind the girl. Kris thought 
to herself, &#39;Maybe if I walk really slow then most of the other girls 
will already be changed and I can slip in and out quickly.&#39; She slowed 
her pace even more dropping by her locker to grab her change of clothes 
she left in there the day before, then started on her way towards the 
gym again. There were two entrances to the gym, one lead to the girls&#39; 
change room and the other to the boys&#39;. A pair of double doors with 
glass windows lead to a hall. In the middle of the hall was a door to 
the change room and at the end of the hall stood another pair of doors 
to the gym. Kris stood at the first pair of doors and watched as girls 
came out of the change room and entered the gym. Only when she felt it 
was safe did she venture into the hall and into the change room. 

Inside she could hear a couple of girls still changing on the other side 
of a row of lockers. Kris quickly found a locker and started to strip 
off her shirt. She looked around to make sure no one was around, tore 
off her shirt and pulled on the sweater as fast as she could so no one 
would get a look at her scarred body. Since the sweatshirt was long she 
didn&#39;t feel as rushed changing her pants. She then shoved everything 
into a locker and locked it before running out of the room and back into 
the hall. 

She leaned against the wall for a moment catching her breath. She wasn&#39;t 
feeling too well, the fog beginning to circle around her again. Just 
then Sarah stepped out of the change room and noticed Kris standing 
against the wall. 

&quot;When did you get changed?&quot; She asked slightly confused. &quot;I didn&#39;t even 
see you in the locker room.&quot;

Kris pushed herself off of the wall and steadied herself, &quot;I&#39;m just fast 
is all.&quot; She gave a weak smile and entered the gym. 

Inside most of the girls were already stretching. The gym teacher was a 
small lady with long brown hair pulled back into a pony tail. She was 
wearing baggy green jogging clothes as were most of the girls. 

The teacher called out for Kris and Sarah to join them. After a few 
minor stretches they were told that they would be going outside for the 
day and the teacher began to lead the group of girls out the door and 
into the cool autumn breeze. 

The cool air felt good against Kris&#39;s face. She closed her eyes and let 
the wind ruffle her hair and wash away most of the feelings that had 
been bothering her for the day. Maybe this was what she really needed. 
To get out and get some fresh air. She opened her eyes to see everyone 
gathering around the teacher at one of the soccer fields. The teacher 
already had a cart of soccer balls ready on the field and she started to 
pull them out and toss them to each of the girls. 

Kris found a spot on the edge of the field and sat down. She watched the 
girls run around chasing their soccer ball. &quot;You&#39;re Kris, right?&quot; She 
heard the teacher call out to her while she pointing at
her. 

Kris only nodded, &#39;Why does everyone seem to know me?&#39; she thought to 
herself.

&quot;Here!&quot; The teacher threw a ball at the girl. Kris brought up both hands 
and caught the ball. She looked at it then back at the teacher. &quot;Come 
on.&quot; The teacher signalled for her to join the group. 

Kris stood up not taking her eyes off the ball. She turned her eyes to 
the teacher and stared at her in such a way that the lady couldn&#39;t help, 
but stop and watch the small girl with curiosity. Kris tossed the ball 
high up into the air. The ball slowly turned in the air and started to 
come back down. Suddenly Kris jumped into the air, spun around in mid 
air and kicked the ball with all her might. The teacher watched the ball 
fly past her and into the goal. She looked back  in time to see
the girl land on one foot and continue to spin until she stopped with 
her back to the teacher, then, almost with no effort at all, turned the 
spin into a stride and walked away towards a small set of stairs that 
lead to a back door of the school. 

Most of the class stood in awe and those who didn&#39;t see asked the others 
what just happened. The teacher dropped the ball she was holding and 
called out to the girls to continue what they were doing as she ran 
after Kris, &quot;Wait!&quot; She called out. 

Kris stopped in place, but did not turn around.

The teacher stopped a few feet from the girl, &quot;Why don&#39;t you join us? I 
know you&#39;re good at sports so you can&#39;t use that as an excuse&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t like sports.&quot; Kris said flatly, &quot;Will that work?&quot;

The teacher put her hands on her hips, &quot;That&#39;s not what I&#39;ve heard. 
Didn&#39;t you win a set of track and field ribbons in your junior high 
school? High jump, triple jump and 100 metres, am I right?&quot; 

Kris slowly turned around to face the woman, &quot;Who really cares.&quot; She 
enumerated with a sigh not really caring. She had heard people 
constantly remind her about how good she was at sports over and over 
again that it was getting on her nerves. She never wanted to be part of 
track or soccer or gymnastics. She just happened to be good at it so 
every teacher would pull her into everything under the sun and her 
parents never let her quit no matter how much she complained. It made 
her sick. Kris looked at the ground, &quot;That was years ago and I don&#39;t 
play sports anymore so don&#39;t bother trying to get me interested.&quot; The 
truth is she used to love track and field. She liked to climb on the 
balancing beam and walk back and forth. She enjoyed the feeling she got 
when she ran as fast as she could. However that was only because 
Jennifer was there cheering her on. It just
wasn&#39;t the same without her around, so Kris decided she wouldn&#39;t play 
any more sports, &quot;You can fail me if you like, but I&#39;m only here for the 
arts and don&#39;t really care if I fail gym. It is not like I really need 
it.&quot; with that she turned around and continued towards the stairs. 

Kris sat on the cold stairs and watched the teacher go back to the 
class. A couple times she saw the lady look over at her, probably trying 
to think how to convince her to join the group, but Kris was not going 
to move from this spot until the bell rang. She closed her eyes and 
leaned her forehead against the cold steel railing and tried to focus on 
regaining her composure so she could face the second half of the school 
day. Now that she has gym class under control all she had to worry about 
is how she is going to avoid everyone during lunch hour. 

She was startled out of her thoughts by the sound of someone sitting 
down next to her. Kris slowly opened her eyes to see Sarah sitting only 
a few feet away on the step below the one Kris sat on. She was leaning 
back so her elbows rested on the top stair, her eyes were shut as she 
looked up at the sun. 

Kris was the first to break the silence, &quot;Did she send you to convince 
me to join in?&quot; she asked coldly.

Sarah did not move. &quot;Nope, I told her is was my time of the month so she 
let me go.&quot; A small smile formed in the corner of the girl&#39;s mouth.

Kris watched the girl with amusement. For the first time today Kris 
really looked at the girl. She had her hair pulled in a tight pony tail 
like the first day they met and was wearing a set of bright pink jogging 
clothes. Sarah finally opened her eyes and looked over at Kris &quot;You 
feeling any better?&quot; She asked with concern in her eyes. 

Kris curled her knees up close to her chest and rocked on her toes. &quot;It 
all depends on what you consider better. I live...&quot; She said softly. 

Sarah leaned forward and tried to look at Kris&#39;s face, but the girl&#39;s 
eyes kept darting from Sarah and back to the ground. Kris found it hard 
to keep her eyes in one place. Finally, Sarah spoke, &quot;Did I do something 
wrong?&quot; She inquired, hurt by Kris&#39;s avoidance. 

Kris raised her head and looked at the sky. She wasn&#39;t sure how to put 
things into words. &quot;No, I&#39;m just having a weird day is all.&quot; She hoped 
that would be the end of the questions. She just couldn&#39;t explain how 
she was feeling right now. All the strange feelings that she thought 
were locked away kept stirring in her mind, &quot;It is hard to explain.&quot; She 
stated with a tired sigh. 

&quot;Oh,&quot; Sarah continued to look at Kris for a long while before turning 
back to watching the other girls chasing the ball around the field. 

Kris felt herself glancing at Sarah from time to time. Sort of doing 
mental snap shots. She learned how to do this trick years ago. She would 
look at a part of someone for a brief moment then turn away before the 
person noticed and slowly she would form a full picture in her mind to 
come back to later. In a way it was an odd game she would find herself 
playing from time to time. Sometimes if she had a pad of paper with her 
she would try to sketch the person without them knowing about it. She 
found this was not very easy because you couldn&#39;t let your target know 
they were being watched and at the same time had to move quickly before 
they moved or walked  away. 

Right now Kris was just content with filing away every detail about the 
girl that sat beside her. She started low, with the feet, and worked her 
way towards the face. She always made this the last part, because not 
only was it the most detailed and the part Kris wanted to remember the 
most, it was more likely that she would get caught taking a glimpse if 
their eyes met. Kris worked her way up to Sarah&#39;s body towards her face 
finding herself stopping at the girl&#39;s lips. She found herself unable to 
move on. Once again struggling with that strange urge from deep within. 
She wanted nothing more than to reach out and brush the back of her hand 
against Sarah&#39;s soft cheek and taste her lips. Kris couldn&#39;t pull her 
eyes away. She kept staring and licking her lips. 

Sarah noticed that Kris was watching her. She turned to look at the 
girl, &quot;Is something wrong? Do I have something on my face?&quot; She reached 
out to touch her face to see if she could find what it was that the 
other girl was staring at. 

Kris felt herself take a deep breath and swallow hard. Her heart was 
hammering in her chest. Abruptly she stood up, rubbing her head, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, I&#39;m not feeling too good.&quot; She ran off towards the gym and 
stormed into the locker room. She fought with her locker and pulled it 
open. Took off her clothes and shoved them into the locker, quickly 
headed for the shower and turned on the water. She let the water pelt 
off her face, she felt dirty for some reason and needed to wash that 
feeling away. She could not believe she was being so childish. They only 
met the other day and here she was battling over wanting a kiss. She hit 
her head on the wall under the shower forcing the feelings to return to 
their cage deep inside of her heart.

Kris heard the bell ring and knew that meant the others would be running 
back soon. So she quickly rushed to her locker. Dried off and tried to 
get her clothes on before anyone arrived. She only got her pants on when 
the other girls started to enter the room. She was fumbling with her 
belt when Sarah came in. She stopped when she saw Kris and, for the 
first time, noticed the girl&#39;s bare upper body. Kris paused for a 
moment, then threw her dress shirt over herself and tie around her neck 
before stuffing her things into her back pack and pushed past Sarah, who 
was still standing near the door. Shoved her way out of the locker room 
not really caring anymore that her top was not buttoned up. 

Sarah quickly chased after the girl, &quot;Kris, wait!&quot; She called down the 
hall. Kris didn&#39;t know why she stopped. She wanted nothing more than to 
hide. She clenched at the front of her shirt feeling exposed. Wishing 
that she had at the very least worn a bra, however she never felt her 
chest was big enough to warrant wearing one. Sarah called out again. 
&quot;Just wait for a moment.&quot; The girl ducked back in the locker room and a 
moment later came running out in her school clothes. She stopped beside 
Kris and smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Kris looked at the girl, she couldn&#39;t for the life of her, figure out 
why she bothered to wait, &quot;Don&#39;t you need to take a shower after gym 
class?&quot; she asked coldly.

Sarah laughed &quot;All I did was sit around, remember?&quot; She reached out and 
flicked one of Kris&#39;s curly wet bangs that hung in the girl&#39;s eyes,&quot;but 
it looked like you needed one. Feeling any better now?&quot; She said with a 
chuckle, &quot;You took off so fast that I was wondering where you ran off 
too.&quot;

Kris pushed through the double doors out into the main school hall. &quot;I 
thought the shower would help, but it didn&#39;t really.&quot; She looked at 
Sarah again as they walked down the hall, &quot;Why do you want to stay 
around me? I mean I&#39;m no- AAHHHHH&quot; She suddenly screamed as a pair of 
arms wrapped around her waist, under her shirt and grabbed her breasts . 
Almost as soon as the attack began, it ended and the girl Kris 
remembered saving the day before ran out from behind her. The girl was 
about Kris&#39;s height with short cut hair and parted down the middle. She 
smiled at Kris and then disappeared down the hall. Kris leaned over with 
her hands on her knees trying hard to regain her breath. She looked up 
at where the girl disappeared to, &quot;What the bloody hell was that all 
about?&quot; She panted

&quot;The Kris Carty Fan club strikes!&quot; Sarah tried hard not to laugh.

Kris looked up at the  girl. &quot;You are kidding, right?&quot;

Sarah laughed, &quot;Did you forget about that group of girls from this 
morning? I&#39;ve heard that you have gained a few followers already and it 
is only the second day.&quot;

Kris did not look amused, &quot;They wouldn&#39;t be fans of me if they knew what 
I was really like.&quot;

Sarah smiled &quot;You&#39;re right, They would run in fear if they knew how kind 
and friendly you can be.&quot; She said with a chuckle.

Kris glared at the girl, &quot;I don&#39;t have time to deal with this today.&quot; 
She stormed away off, buttoning up her shirt as she went.
