<p align="justify"><strong>Isabella&rsquo;s   POV</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I could feel   the cool wind blowing to my face, as Elila holds me protectively in   her arms and flew to the direction that goes to my home. We didn't talk   much after we took off from the dark alley just now. I was relieved   to get out from there because it was such a fear for me for the second   time.... and also embarrassing! <strong><em>'God, what were you thinking Isa?!   You particularly like 'rape' her!!'</em></strong> I thought angrily to myself.   I felt so ashamed and slowly look at Elila, trying to see her features   of her face.</p>
<p align="justify">Her face looks   so calm with full of concentration as she flew in such a leisure speed   that I'm beginning to like it. I felt so touched because she was trying   to be extra gentle with me after all that I have gone through. Or is   it just for now...or would it be other times too? I couldn't help thinking   how fair and beautiful she is and how could she ever be chosen for a   protector. From the outside, she looks like a fragile young girl who   people have to defend for her...but seeing her fight surprisingly deadly   just now, I guess that's what people say, <strong><em>'Don't judge the book   by its cover.'</em></strong> Right! I have to remember that now. I wanted   to touch those cheeks, wanting to know how soft it feels under my fingertips.   But no, I have to stop myself...I can't do this again...I have a boyfriend   for god sake!! But being so near to her body, I could almost feel her   heartbeat pounding faster and louder and I could even see her silver   eyes glowing sometimes. I see her struggling silently, not wanting to   show how obvious it was...how obvious it is that she's struggling hard   not to mate me. The sound of it somehow terrifies me, but I couldn't   help feeling excited and so desired thinking about it. Unintentionally,   I slowly moved to her neck, touching her and nuzzling her with the tip   of my nose. I could hear her gasp a little and holds me tighter - as   her flying began to unbalance a little. It then occurs to me how evil   I was being to her, being such a tease. But I didn't mean to...I just   couldn't help but follow these...new feelings. New feelings I have never   felt before, not even with Melvin. Guiltily, I pulled away and look   away from her as I hear her sigh softly.</p>
<p align="justify">I dared myself   to look down and I realized that we're passing the forest below us.   The forest is actually beside my home; my bedroom's big window is facing   directly at the beautiful scenery of woods. My family and I are really   drawn of the beauty of it when we moved here, as I was thirteen years   old and started going to school here too. And that was when I met Elila   for the first time where I saw her jumping from a tree to a tree outside   my bedroom's big window. I found her amusingly unique yet so mysterious   when I first made eye contact her; and when she first saw me, I could   see her body language...moving like a wolf and so curious as if I was   another new creature that never exists in this world. Till this day,   I still find it weird at how we became friends at that moment. But no   matter how drawn I was to the forest, yet I was never allowed to enter   because there were rumours that there are wild animals roaming freely   in the big forest. This makes me always wonder how on earth Elila always   seem to enter the forest after she walks me back home. Saying that it   was the shortest path to go to her home - was she just plain crazy and   was she telling the craziest truth? But after knowing who she's actually   was, I guess that answers everything that I find weird about her during   our years of friendship.</p>
<p align="justify">My mind was   still busy thinking when I felt Elila starting to stretch her wings   high up and starts to descend slowly. I realized that I have reached   my humble home. As she landed on the ground, in front of my house's   entrance door, she gently put me down from her arms. I whimpered a little,   missing the contact of warmness of her body immediately. Then she just   stands there in front of me, keeping quiet and unmoved, waiting for   me to get inside. <strong><em>'Gosh, this is so awkward!'</em></strong> I mentally   said to myself. I start to nervously rub my arms up and down as if I   was cold from the cool night. What am I going to say to her? Then I   hear Elila said something, simply to stop the awkwardness between us.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You're   home."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">After hearing   that, I couldn't help but giggled a little.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Of   course I'm home silly! Don't be such a goof!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Excuse   me?! I'm so not a goof here!"</strong> I heard her scoffed playfully.</p>
<p align="justify">I don't know   how, but we suddenly started our ridiculous playful argument by calling   silly names to each other. It was light and fun...makes me forget about   what really happened to me in the alley. The next thing I know, I was   laughing so loud and start punching lightly on Elila's firm stomach.   How I missed the old days...And how....</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   miss you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   miss you too little belle."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>'Ooops?   Did I say that out loud?'</em></strong> I thought blinking. I look at her   and she was smiling at me softly. There were so many emotions in her   eyes that I'm kind of afraid if I figure out what is she's feeling now,   I'll be freak out or just give in to what I'm feeling now. So, I quickly   change the topic before things get awkward between us. <strong><em>'Remember,   we are trying to patch up and be friends again,'</em></strong> I thought to   myself.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You   know, I always thought you're going to get a death wish or something   whenever you run into the woods...but now I know why."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She starts   looking at the forest on her right side, trying to remember the times   she always walk me back home I guess. She then looks at me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   told you that my home is near...quite in the middle of the forest actually   and this path is the shortcut to my home. Actually, if you want to know,   most of my father and mother's kin stays around, near or inside the   forest. Just like your home. The forest is enormously big so there're   lots of spaces to build houses or cabins for people who are drawn to   the forest. But so far, my blood kin are the only ones staying here,   so your house is actually the only one that is closest to the forest."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Wow...that's   interesting. So, have any of your members been like...watching me?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I felt somehow   uncomfortable with the thought of anybody stalking me. It's creepy.   Did Elila watch me when we were not friends? Did Melvin spy on me?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"So   far, not that I know of. I have warned others not to spy on you, if   not they will have to come to me. So you don't have to worry."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You?   Did you spy on me?!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I look at her,   accusing her a little. She was taken back a little of my slightly harsh   tone. How I wish I could take back, but I need to know if she did spy   on me. I need to trust her. Her face suddenly looks calm as she steps   a bit closer to me, closing a gap between us.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Isa,   I know it's going to be hard for you to trust me. I may realize that   you're my...ermm my..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Mate?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Elila looks   down and cough a little. I was surprised that she blushes a little as   she looks at me again.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Ermm   yes. My mate. I know that you belong to Melvin now and I know that I   wasn't truthful about whom I really was. I'm really sorry for a lot   of things; of what you have to see the truth about me in a violent way,   of what I have done to you, I'm sorry. But I'll always respect you and   your privacy. So to answer your question, I have never spied on you   for I would never do that to you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She takes my   hand as I felt like I stop breathing in an instance. Her warmth hand   covered my cool hand; it was full of warmth and love as it spread through   my body.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   wish for us to be friends again. Will that be alright?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>'Oh God!   I think I'm going to melt! Come on, say yes!'</em></strong> My mind was screaming   like mad at me. But I couldn't even say a word as I look deeply into   her eyes. I could get lost to it forever. So I just shake my head to   answer her. Then I see her mouth giving a soft smile. <strong><em>'Oh God!   I'm so going to melt AGAIN!'</em></strong> I thought as she pulled my hand   to bring me closer to her and pulled me into a hug. Without a thought,   I put my arms around her neck and buried my head into her warm neck,   noticing a slight smell of lavender. It was comforting my mind gradually   as Elila hugged me tightly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Thank   you little belle. This means a lot to me."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I didn't answer   her because I'm afraid my tears will fall if I talk now. So I just hold   her tightly. It was surprising that our bodies fitted perfectly together.   It seems our hug takes way longer than a friend's hug but I don't seem   to mind. Neither does her. It was a loving hug that I never had before...not   even from Melvin. This now makes me feel a bit guilty for comparing   him to her.</p>
<p align="justify">Then suddenly,   I felt Elila shot her head up, looking around. I pulled back a little   and see her face looking serious with concentration. I think she was   sensing something...but I have no idea because I have no abilities like   her. I'm just an ordinary human. Then she looked at me seriously. Something   was bothering her I know.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What's   wrong Elila?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">She kept quiet   but her expression says all - hurt and upset.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Somebody   is waiting for you inside."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I sighed in   relief. Maybe I figured her expression wrongly?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Oh!   That must be my father. He always waits for me to get back from an outing."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">But she still   kept awfully quiet. Her expression still hasn't change but she just   pulled me in a hug. It felt like a protective hug...what was she afraid   of? I can't figure her out. But she just whispered to my ear.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Take   care little belle. You still remembered my home number and cell phone   number don't you? I'll always be there for you. Good night."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Then she pulled   away and left me in confusion. But I just watch her as she starts running   towards the forest. As she was near to the forest, I could see her feathered   wings start to fade and big black feathers starts dancing lightly around   the air. In astonishment, I could see her shape shifting into a black-silver   wolf and disappeared into the woods. I hear the other wolves howling   suddenly from the distance. Do the wolves know her? Will she be alright?   I began to worry but I have to keep telling myself that she's a protector   and able to protect herself. I shook my head a few times for thinking   too much for this night and notice one of her feathered wing near my   doorstep. I squat down a little to pick it up and caress it. It was   unbelievably soft, like velvet. Wanting to keep it, I hold it and open   the entrance door of my home.</p>
<p align="justify">As I was inside,   I already start feeling the warmness that was coming from the fireplace.   I turn to the living room and see my dad sitting on his favourite couch,   reading one of his literature books. I come closer to him and give a   soft peck on his cheek. He glanced at me with a soft loving smile, gesturing   for me to sit in front of him. My father is always dear towards me.   He always wants me to sit with him and talk about my day outing whenever   I come back home. But how am I going to tell him about tonight? What   will he say? What would his reaction be if I mention Elila's name? But   nevertheless, I take a sit in front of him as he put his beautiful-craved-hardcover   book at the side table and turn to face me with a warm smile.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"So   Isabella, how was your date?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I tensed a   little when I heard <strong><em>'date'</em></strong>. It makes me think about Melvin   and I can feel my blood boiling gradually. Even I could see my father   tense a little but for a different fact. It seems that my father does   not quite approve of Melvin because he is not <strong><em>'the one'</em></strong> for me. I think back of a time when we had a brief discussion about   Elila and me after the incident in the principal's office a year ago.</p>
<p align="justify">After I had   realized that Elila was not the person that I thought she was and also   the fact that I am to be her mate - I freaked out! Don't get me wrong   because I'm not a homophobic....it's just that I couldn't imagine myself   with her. Maybe it is because that Elila could be so violent and it   scares me so. I remembered my father comforting me many times whenever   I had this panic feeling that one day Elila will take me against my   will. And whenever I see her in school, I'll run to another direction   with such fear in me. I remembered my father saying to me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Isabella   dear, you have to stop this. It's been 8 months."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Stop   what? What did I do?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Avoiding   her. Sooner or later, you both will reunite back."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">When I heard   that, I was horrified. Was my own father matchmaking I behind my back?   What is he doing?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What?   You want me to give in to her? I WOULD NOT!!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I heard my   father sighed slowly. I was acting much of a child to him but I was   determined not to give my body to Elila.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   did not say that you must BE WITH Elila, dear. I'm saying; no matter   what she is a loyal and good friend to you. I have seen it in the years   you both been together."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Well,   maybe she was playing sweet so she could get me."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was bitter.   Too bitter. I couldn't even believe that I could be so bitter in all   my living years.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Tell   me dear. Did you ever think that Elila knew that you are her mate before   her father makes a huge announcement in Mrs. Graham Office?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I thought about   it slowly. I remembered Elila's shocking face when she started being   slightly intimate with me in that office. The thought of it makes my   legs move uneasy and I have no idea why.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"No......"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Did   she ever make a move on you before that even a little bit dear?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"No......"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I finally felt   ashamed of my behaviour. I didn't hear my father speaking for awhile.   He just waited for me to understand my years of friendship with Elila.   I realized that it was honest and innocent between me and Elila. Then   my father put his hand on my left shoulder.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Dear,   it's alright to take a break from your friendship. Take your time. I'm   sure that Elila will understand you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Hearing that,   I felt myself crying a little. My father held me as tears fell from   me. Sometimes I wish things would be the same as it used to....but it   won't be anymore.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"And   dear....if it comes a time you agree to be with Elila....I won't stop   you."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was shocked   and I quickly pulled away from my father and looked at him. He looked   calm with an understanding that was shown in his eyes.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"If   you agree to be a mate to her, you have my approval. She is a good person   and comes from a good background. You'll have my blessing when the day   arrives if you want to be with her."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Still in shocked,   I was speechless. I couldn't believe what my father had just said. But   then....</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Thanks   dad...but I don't think I will be with her...."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Oh?   And why is that?" </strong>my father asked, as he raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p align="justify">I looked at   him with confidence.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Because   I'm into boys and I'm starting to date this guy named Melvin."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">That was 4   months ago. I can't believe time flies so fast. It feels like I was   having that conversation with my father just yesterday. And 4 months   I didn't even know that Melvin is a protector. I hear my father asking   me again as I start to focus on him.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Oh...my   date was....was..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Well?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I sighed in   frustration. I didn't have any idea how to cover up from my father.   I might as well say the truth.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Dad,   Melvin left me alone."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">After muttering   those words, my father suddenly got up from his couch immediately. I   could see a hint of anger in his eyes and I tried to be as calm as I   could.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"He   WHAT? If I get to meet this Melvin boy..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Dad,   I don't think that's important right now...please sit down, please?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was pleading   with him softly as I look up at him. I somehow don't feel like talking   about Melvin with my father but one way or another, his name would surely   come out. But I guess I should tell my father about another near rape   incident I had earlier this night. My father slowly sits down on his   couch and his face became serious.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What   is it dear? Did something happen?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I take a deep   breath and told him what happened. About the near rape from the two   men in the alley; about how Elila saved I and she healed my bruises   again. I told him everything that had happened except the part where   I <strong>'sexually attacked'</strong> Elila in the alley. The thought of it made   me shiver with a hint of pleasure. <strong><em>'Oh god, I can't feel like   this right now, and certainly not in front of my father!' </em></strong> I thought as I tried hard to sit properly, avoiding the sudden uneasiness   between my legs. After telling him everything, my father lay back on   his couch and probably trying to understand what I told him. There was   a tension in the room; me acting as a nervous wreck wondering what my   father will say next. But surprisingly, he moved slightly forward from   his couch quietly, looking at me with a calm face.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Do   you feel any pain? Are you all right?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Uh   no. No pain. Elila healed me completely. I'm all right really but perhaps   a little traumatic about the incident just now."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He smiled a   little and holds both of my hands, giving a tight squeeze. I could see   that he's tired while he was waiting for me to come back, but he never   complains at all...although he does give a disapproval talk whenever   I'm going out with Melvin.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"So...Melvin   is actually Elila's cousin. Isn't that weird for you?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"A   little actually,"</strong> I said, still not getting where this topic   is heading.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"And   you and Elila is getting back together...as friends?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">My father was   asking me this with a hint of a humour. I find it irritating because   he still won't believe me that I would not choose Elila....or would   I? Inside I was growing with a deep frustration.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Yes   dad. We're just going to be friends."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">And then, ridiculously,   he starts to giggle, thinking that I was telling a light joke. I was   becoming annoyed and pouted a little in front of him. He just looked   at me and tried to be serious. Then he just got up his couch and lean   forward to hug me. I really didn't get my dad at all but I just sighed   and hug him back too. Then he softly said to me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You   have grown Isa but there are still some things that you need to find   out on your own."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He pulled away   from me and stood up, bringing his book and leaving the living room,   as if he was off to bed now. Before he left the room, he turned towards   me and said calmly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"There   is a reason that I don't approve of Melvin   even though he is a protector too. But whatever decisions you make Isa,   choose it wisely in the near future. Good night girl."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   he smiled softly and left. I was a bit surprised by his sudden calmness.   He wasn't even upset about the near rape experience. Or was it that   Elila was there again to save me that he felt such relieved? I shake   my head several times as I got up and went up the stairs to go to my   room.</p>
<p align="justify">As I walk up   the last steps of the stairs, I start to feel the exhaustion washing   through my body as I reach to my room. I sighed tiredly and turn the   doorknob and enter my humble room that is filling with darkness. I went   inside and close the door and start searching for a switch light. After   how many times trying to find for the switch in the dark, I finally   found it and gratefully switch it on. But as I turn around, I was shock   to see a figure on my balcony window, grinning boyishly at me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Hey   babe."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Melvin?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>'Maybe   I shouldn't have switch on the lights,'</em></strong> I groaned to myself   as I stare blankly at him.</p>
<p align="justify">Melvin got   up from the balcony window and starts coming towards me. His handsome   yet somehow devilish face starts to show under the lights in my room.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"How   is my baby tonight?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">It took me   awhile to REALLY think that he was here in my room, and not a dream.   It also took me awhile to realize that Elila must have sense that Melvin   was up here earlier. <strong><em>'So that's why she looks slightly upset,'</em></strong> I thought to myself, somehow apart of me feeling guilty about it. Then   I realize that Melvin's arms are around me as he tries to kiss me. I   tensed up suddenly in his arms but he doesn't seem to notice my discomfort   as he pulls me tighter towards him, somehow quite possessive in a way.   But I wasn't in the mood for romance with him now for I was still mad   at him for leaving me tonight. If he didn't leave me alone, none of   these incidents would happened tonight...but I could see that he's trying   to get his way with me now, making it quite charming. But what I feel   now is suffocation!</p>
<p align="justify">I pushed him   away from me as roughly as I could. I need to breathe, so I went to   my balcony window and look outside. The slight breeze is very welcoming.   It's cooling towards my face. Then suddenly I felt Melvin trying to   put his arms around my waist but I angrily pushed him away again. And   then I hear his irritated sighed from behind me, very different from   the Melvin that I knew. Is this the real him?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What   the hell is wrong with you Isabella?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He roughly   takes my left arm and turns me around so I look at him directly. I winced   at the pain on my arm but I try to be brave. I look at his face - it   has a slight accusation, like the entire night was my fault. The thought   of that makes my blood boils deeply as I angrily hissed at him.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"YOU   LEFT ME ALONE TONIGHT MELVIN! For God's sake! Don't you want to know   what had happened to me tonight?!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He snorted   a little that holds his arrogance.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Aw   baby, you know you could take care of yourself..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   WAS NEARLY RAPED DAMNIT! AND WEREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT ME?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He suddenly   went speechless but I could still see that he has a big rock in his   head. I know I was becoming...well hysterical... just a little. But   I couldn't help myself. I still kept on <strong><em>'bitching'</em></strong> at   him even though I have a great feeling that it would somehow lead me   into a bad time. But I still kept on and on bitterly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Aren't   you a protector Melvin? You think you could hide your real identity   from me? So what if you are <em>'one'</em>? For all I know, you did not   do a good job!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">As he heard   that, he hissed at me and simply grabs my left arm, squeezing tightly.   I think he's trying to find my obedience towards him for I could feel   my arm getting numb from his great brutal strength. Inside me, I was   crying, wanting him to release my arm but I stupidly wanted to stay   strong.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Shut   up Isabella! Or you'll be sorry..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"What?   If Elila didn't save me from the rape..."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"WHAT?!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">His sudden   screamed wasn't what I expected. He roughly pushed me and I was suddenly   flying towards the wall, and before I could slump down, his hand just   grab my neck with a firm grip, probably forgetting that he has a greater   strength than other humans or either he doesn't care at all. I was in   pain. I was crying from the inside. I always thought Melvin was such   a gentleman....but things starts to change when he reached the age of   18. Why? As I try to focus on reality, he was standing quite close to   my face and snarled at me. Oh god..</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Why   is that half-breed helping you? ANSWER ME!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was confused.   Half-breed? Who? Is he asking about Elila?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Elila?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"YES   YOU SLUT! HAVE YOU BEEN GOING OUT WITH HER BEHIND MY BACK? ANSWER ME!"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">After trying   my hardest to stay strong, I couldn't take it anymore. I let the tears   flow down on my face. He called me a slut....just like Mark called me   when he tried to rape me last year. Why do I get this punishment? I   just shake my head, answering him no. I see him grinning sickly as he   let go of me and I slump down from the wall hard. I was crying harder   and harder as I could feel all the pains and new dark bruises every   part of my body. I didn't even realize that he suddenly pick me up and   bring me to my bed. He put me down surprisingly gently and sits beside   me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I'm   sorry baby. I just get scared if you're going out with that half-breed.   Do forgive me?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I look at him   thinking he is crazy. His face looks calm all of the sudden. But I could   still hear the bitterness when he says <strong><em>'half-breed'</em></strong>. Does   he hate her so much?</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Why   do you hate her?"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">He just gave   an arrogant chuckled and look at me with such pride.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"She   may be my 2nd cousin but with that filthy animal blood in her...I don't   think of her as <em>one of us.</em>"</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was too shocked   to say anything. Even more shocked and greatly uncomfortable as he takes   possession by kissing me roughly.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Now   quiet baby, I came here for a reason."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   he firmly pushes me down so I was flat on my back on my bed. All the   physical pains and possibly mentally is killing me greatly. But he doesn't   seem to care as he goes down to my neck and nibble it. I didn't feel   any pleasure for he was somehow being rough and hurting me at the same   time. I couldn't take it anymore and I pushed him away again. He didn't   budge at all as he continuously rubs my breasts roughly. The word <strong><em> 'slut'</em></strong> keeps on screaming in my mind....I somehow feel dirty   so I pushed him really hard.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Melvin,   I don't think it's a good time. I need to go to school tomorrow. Please   leave."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Though I meant   it, I said it softly like a whisper. I was too scared to be brave again.   I can see the disappointment in his face deeply but he immediately forced   a smile on his face.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"Alright   baby. I'll leave."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   he just went to the balcony window, leaving all the arguments unsolved.   Making me the bad one. As he steps out the window, he turns his head   towards me.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You   know, I have needs Isabella."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">I was too tired   to think of what he had said.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"I   love you baby. But we need to discuss of our intimacy. You can't leave   me like this as you play with your games."</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong><em>'What?'</em></strong> I thought. I can feel a big headache coming.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>"You   only belong to me. Remember, the half-breed can't give you what you   want."</strong></p>
<p align="justify">With that,   he just jumps off the window and leaves me with a big headache. Slowly,   I got up off the bed, walking towards my bathroom very slowly because   of the great pain I felt on my back. As I reach inside the bathroom,   I cried a little as I tried to take off my clothes one by one. My body   was once again - bruised. Not by rape or so....but my own boyfriend.   And as I step inside the shower stall and adjust the warm water, I slumped   down and cried all my heart out.&nbsp;</p>
