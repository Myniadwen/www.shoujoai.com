<a href="../original/morbid1-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Olaf House

Deep in the gloomiest area of the southernwoods lived the Olaf family. 
Though they were large in numbers they lived scattered throughout the 
land. Long ago they were a prestigious family, one that rivalled all 
others, now they were forced to hide amongst the trees like rats. It was 
none of their faults that creditors crippled them. A sly salesman had 
promised to bring them great wealth in a foolproof scheme. The man 
turned out to be nothing more then a rat in disguise and the Olafs 
turned out to be the true fools in the end. They were forced out of 
their homes and set to live in shacks that they could barely afford. The 
troubles took a large toll on many and strife soon finished the latter 
off, leaving only the remaining few still living in obscurity, awaiting 
their return to high society. 

On that solemn night Mrs. Olaf stood upon the pouch of their rickety 
home, a building that was even older then she and should have been 
condemned ages ago. She watched the skies as she prepared her plans to 
take back what her husband lost all those years ago. Now with him long 
buried she had become known as a murderous matriarch, brutal in ways of 
dealing with those in the family that step out of line. She was a 
malicious old woman with a black heart. Her hair always pulled back in a 
tight bun at the back of her head and held in place by a pair of 
knitting needles, a black mourning gown cut to mid forearm showing her 
long wrinkled arms and hands to the world, its lace neckline hugged 
tightly around her thin neck, only her long withered face to be seen. 
Thought lines creased her brow as she squinted at the stars, reading 
them for some hint of the coming day. She was an old gypsy of sorts and 
knew a lot about the arcane arts and fortune telling. Tonight the stars 
seemed worrisome and their patterns intrigued the old woman.

&quot;Auntie?&quot; A child&#39;s voice broke through the old woman&#39;s musing, &quot;Is 
everything alright?&quot; A small girl of merely thirteen years looked up at 
the woman with curious concern in her eyes. Her hair pulled to either 
side in pigtails and an oversized dress covering her frail body. A large 
bloodhound stood at the girl&#39;s side also watching the woman. 

The old dam turned her deep sunken eyes upon the child, &quot;The stars tell 
me that a great evil is about to befall our lands.&quot; She simply remarked.

The child glanced up at the stars and tilted her head curiously at them, 
&quot;They do? Are you going to help stop them, Auntie?&quot; She asked with huge 
pleading eyes. 

The old woman&#39;s laugher filled the empty woods causing many crows to 
scatter to the air, &quot;My dear Alice, your innocence is so reassuring at 
times.&quot; She pointed up at the sky, &quot;This evil is what we have been 
awaiting all this time. It will free us from our bounds and raise us 
back up to the height of nobility.&quot; She hissed, &quot;It just needs a little 
help along the way.&quot;

&quot;Will me and Macbeth get to play too?&quot; Alice asked patting the dog on 
the head. 

&quot;We will all get to play soon enough my child.&quot; Mrs. Olaf rung her hands 
together greedily as she glazed across the yard towards the twinkling 
lights of town then down upon the child&#39;s curious face again, &quot;I have 
just the job for you.&quot; She touched Alice&#39;s little button nose with one 
of her long nailed causing the girl to wiggle it, &quot;Come with me.&quot; She 
signalled for the girl to follow as the old dam opened the door to the 
house with the girl and dog following. 

The door creaked in protest of being moved, its hinges long in need of 
repair. Inside was a single large room that served as a kitchen, dining 
area and den. The old woman walked across the room, her footfalls echoed 
upon the old floorboards, under which she had buried her old husband, a 
toothy smile playing across her face every time she treaded over the 
man&#39;s shallow grave. She only wished that she had killed the man 
earlier. She pulled out a chair from around the old table and placed it 
next to the fireplace at the far wall, where a large black caldron hung 
over a roaring fire. 

&quot;What is that?&quot; Alice asked plugging her nose from the smell that 
emitted as the woman lifted the lid off the caldron with a mittened 
hand. Macbeth sniffed at the air then yelped as if in pain and ran out 
of the room to lie upon the patio once again.

&quot;A special something for our noble friends.&quot; The old dam chuckled softly 
as she stirred her brew with a large wooden spoon, and then stood up to 
look upon the many jars that were set along the fireplace mantel. She 
grabbed jar filled with a brown powder and sprinkled a pinch into the 
caldron, &quot;That should do it.&quot; She exclaimed with hideous glee.

&quot;That should do what?&quot; A voice asked from the door. A rugged man with a 
large scruffy black beard covering his full face and a corncob pipe 
sticking out of his mouth stepped into the house, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to intrude, 
but your door was open.&quot; He carefully closed the door behind him. 

The woman turned to look at the man, &quot;It is about time you arrived, 
Henry.&quot; She stated coldly as she pulled an empty glass jar off the 
mantle, &quot;The day is at hand and I have a job for you.&quot; She spooned a 
large scoop of deep green goo from the caldron into the jar until it was 
filled to the brim and screwed the lid on tight.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am.&quot; The handyman apologized, &quot;I was busy in town. There 
is a rather agitated mood to the folks today.&quot; He explained taking off 
his fisherman&#39;s hat, &quot;Made my job rather difficult.&quot; 

&quot;Well, the days of working for others are about to end.&quot; Mrs. Olaf 
stated as she filled yet another jar of the brew, &quot;Alice, dear?&quot; She 
called the girl to her side, &quot;I want you to do something for your 
Auntie.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; The girl&#39;s eyes glimmered with excitement.

The old woman patted the girl on the head, &quot;I love that eagerness of 
yours.&quot; She said with a warm smile, &quot;I want you to take this to the 
Holland Manor and break it upon the building walls. Can you do that for 
me?&quot; She asked politely. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; She asked curiously gazing at the jar in the woman&#39;s 
hands. She was almost certain she saw something swimming amongst the 
foggy green substance in the jar.

&quot;A gift.&quot; Mrs. Olaf explained gently, &quot;Now I want you to be careful not 
to drop it.&quot; She picked up a basket from under the table, placed both 
jars carefully within before handing it to the girl, &quot;Also, could you 
take your lonesome cousin Cecil with you?&quot; She asked politely, &quot;He broke 
three of my best plates and I really do not wish to see the likes of him 
for a while.&quot; She added in distaste.  

Alice nodded in understanding; &quot;I think I saw him near the bog. I&#39;ll go 
find him.&quot; She took the basket in hand and skipped out the door, 
&quot;Ceeeeccciiilllll!!!!&quot; She called out for the boy. 

Henry Basset watched the girl&#39;s peculiarity, &quot;What was that all about 
just now, ma&#39;am?&quot; He asked feeling left out.

The old woman was filling yet another jar, &quot;Just a concoction I&#39;ve 
created to spice things up in town a little.&quot; Mrs. Olaf stated as she 
placed another jars gentle into another basket, &quot;Is Lady Greystoke still 
planning renovations of the castle tomorrow?&quot; She asked and gave him a 
smile that set a shiver through his spine. 

&quot;Y... yes, ma&#39;am.&quot; Henry answered nervously, &quot;and I joined the work crew 
just as you asked too.&quot;

The old woman&#39;s grin broadened, &quot;Good, good.&quot; She picked up the basket 
and handed it over to the man, &quot;Tomorrow Lady Greystoke will be in for a 
surprise.&quot; She stated with a light chuckle. &quot;Come pick me up first thing 
in the morning. You will find your pay in the basket. Do not be late.&quot; 
She demanded. 

&quot;Ah... Alright...&quot; Henry anxiously stammered and scratched his head, 
&quot;Whatever you say ma&#39;am.&quot; He quickly left the house. Not sure if he 
should ask any more questions.

&quot;Cecil, Where are you?&quot; Alice snarled in annoyance as the branches of 
yet another bush tugged upon the hem of her dress. Her innocent 
demeanour all but faded now that she was out of the earshot of her Aunt, 
&quot;What does he find so compelling about this hellish brush?&quot; She 
struggled with her garment getting increasingly frustrated, &quot;Let me go!&quot; 
She hissed and with one final tug the twig broke free causing the girl 
to stumble backwards and nearly trip over something. She managed to hold 
tight onto the basket as she regained her balance. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; A young boy of maybe fourteen years got to his feet, &quot;Watch where 
you are goin&#39;?&quot; He snapped as he spun around to face the intruder to his 
domain. His eyes widened in shock as they fell upon his younger cousin, 
&quot;Alice, what are you doing out here?&quot; He asked in surprise to see the 
girl so deep in the forest at night. 

To say the girl disliked the boy would be a large understatement. She 
glared menacingly at the boy, glancing at his muddy trouser and torn 
shirt in disgust. Alice took a deep breath to calm herself, &quot;Our aunt 
wants you to come to town with me.&quot; She stated with a sigh, loathing the 
idea of being with her filthy cousin. 

&quot;Why?&quot; Cecil asked, scratching his head in dismay. 

Alice shook her head and tried to cover her disdain, &quot;Why can&#39;t you be 
more a gentleman for once. Are you just going to let a young lady go to 
town alone after dark?&quot; She posed. 

&quot;What lady?&quot; Cecil inquired looking around the woods. 

Alice clenched her teeth, &quot;Me, you fool!&quot; She announced now seething 
with anger, &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll just have to explain to our Aunt why I was 
forced to go on my own.&quot; She turned with a twirl and started towards 
town. 

Cecil stood watching the girl push her way through the trees. He milled 
over his options weighing both outcomes. While he did not really care 
what happened to his cousin he feared the wrath of his Aunt even more. 
As Alice began to disappear into the shadows the decision became very 
apparent and he started after the girl, &quot;Wait!&quot; The boy called out after 
his cousin, &quot;I&#39;ll go with you.&quot; 

******

Not far from Holland Manor a large old cemetery stretched out across the 
land, where many of the towns ancestors now lay. Travellers to the hall 
found themselves venturing closer to this hallowed land of the dead then 
they would normally dare. There always seemed to be a light fog drifting 
over the ground making it hard to see anything apart from a few 
headstones peeking out here and there. On that late night the Holland 
Twins wove their way through the many headstones. Their black clothes 
almost making them seem as one with the shadows. They crept sure-footed 
through some of the less travelled areas of the graveyard. All of a 
sudden the eerie silence was broken by the sounds of giggles in this 
dead land.

&quot;What have you found, Alison?&quot; One of the girls queried as she jumped a 
small bush to come to her sister&#39;s side. 

&quot;Nothing much Alex.&quot; The other girl announced, &quot;Just an old friend.&quot; She 
stated pointing at a wooden cross sticking out of the ground. The 
cross-comprised of two pieces of floorboard and had a name carved 
hastily upon its surface.

Alexandria smiled down at the sight of the cross, &quot;Poor little Amanda. I 
wonder if she is doing well?&quot;

&quot;Shall we see?&quot; Alison suggested with a wicked grin while holding out a 
shovel to her sister. 

The twin took the tool in hand, &quot;Yes, let&#39;s give the girl a little 
hello.&quot; She set the spade upon the dirt, placed her foot along the flat 
and gave a quick shove causing the blade to cut through the soil. It did 
not take them long before Alexandria hit something other then dirty. 

&quot;I think I hit something.&quot; Alexandria stated pulling her shovel out of 
the dirt. 

Alison was the first to drop to the ground, digging at the soil with her 
bare hands, &quot;I found her!&quot; She called out in excitement as she uncovered 
a socked foot. 

&quot;I thought for sure that we buried her deeper then this.&quot; Alexandria 
uttered slightly distressed, &quot;Good thing a wolf did not find her.&quot; 

&quot;A wolf!&quot; Alison&#39;s eyes brightened with glee at the idea, &quot;She could 
have been torn to shreds.&quot; A small giggle emitted from her lips. 

Alexandria shook her head at her sister, &quot;You and your fascination with 
animals.&quot; At that moment Alexandria thought she heard a sound from 
behind her, &quot;Someone is coming!&quot; She exclaimed anxiously as she ducked 
low to the ground, &quot;Bloody hell this is not good. We can&#39;t be caught 
here.&quot; 	

Alison peeked her head out of the shallow grave, &quot;It is perfect.&quot; She 
said with a malicious glint in her eye. She caught a glimpse of movement 
from the corner of her vision, &quot;To your left.&quot; She whispered. She pulled 
a small dagger from the sash around her waist, then leapt out of the 
hole and darted between the stone with her sister moving with equal 
stealth right behind her. Within seconds Alison found her prey and was 
upon them. She sprung out of the shadows swiftly and her knife found her 
victim&#39;s throat with ease. She jabbed the blade deep into the person&#39;s 
neck and grinned in delight at the sight of the crimson that covered her 
hands. She pulled the blade free and ducked out of the way as her sister 
sprung from her hiding spot. Alexandria brought her shovel hard across 
the person&#39;s face with enough force to cause the person to fall 
backwards into someone else and send the lot of them tumbling to the 
ground. 

&quot;Cecil!?!&quot; A voice screamed out and the twins stepped forwards to face 
their new prey to find Alice struggling from beneath her cousin. 

&quot;Evening Alice!&quot; Alison merrily greeted the girl while wiping the blood 
off her knife with her dress. 

&quot;Alice, it has been so long!&quot; Alexandria exclaimed in excitement, &quot;Where 
have you been?&quot; She asked, offering a helping hand to the girl. 

&quot;Hi Lady Alison, Lady Alexandria.&quot; Alice greeted the girls in a bit of a 
daze then blinked at her dying cousin and let out a sigh, &quot;Stupid boy.&quot; 
She freed herself from under the boy, took Alexandria&#39;s hand pulled 
herself to her feet. She took on more look at her cousin and shook her 
head at the sight of him. 

There was a bloody smear where his nose used to be and an awful gash 
along the side of his neck, which was spewing blood; Alice felt it made 
quite an improvement to his rather ungodly face. He clenched at his 
throat as he choked on his own blood. He reached out his other hand 
towards Alice, &quot;Agg...lic...sss&quot; He stuttered with his dying breath.

Alison looked down at the boy and cupped her hands over her mouth &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry...Was... he someone special to you?&quot; She inquired, slightly 
doubtful of her actions, but not entirely. 

&quot;No, Lady Alison.&quot; Alice answered bluntly, shaking her head, &quot;Just my 
foolish cousin. I told him not to investigate those sounds. I knew it 
had to be the two of you.&quot; She stated still watching the boy&#39;s blood 
spill out over the ground and then turned to face the twin. &quot;What were 
you up? Burying someone?&quot; She asked as she eagerly peered over Alison&#39;s 
shoulders. 

&quot;Just checking on someone.&quot; Alexandria stated nonchalantly, &quot;What about 
you? Out for a nightly killing?&quot;

Alice let out a disappointed sigh, &quot;No, Lady Alexandria. Unfortunately I 
was on an errand for my Aunt.&quot; Alice explained, she suddenly became 
aware that she was no longer holding the basket, &quot;Oh no! Where did the 
basket go?&quot; She searched around her cousin to find the basket had fallen 
to the ground not far from his head and the jars smashed upon a 
headstone. The brew completely absorbed into the earthen soil, &quot;Oh no! 
Auntie is going to kill me!&quot; 

Alison looked down at the shards of glass, &quot;What was in the jar?&quot; She 
asked curiously. 

Alice spun around to Alison, her face distraught with worry, &quot;It is a 
potion my Aunt made for your family, Lady Alison. This is horrible.&quot; 

Alexandria stabbed the end of her shovel into the ground and set her 
hand upon the end, &quot;There is nothing we can do now, however we should do 
something about him.&quot; She nodded towards Cecil. 

Alison clapped her hand together with glee, &quot;We can put him with Amanda. 
They will not be lonely that way.&quot; She stated with a giggle.

Alex scratched her head, &quot;You are something else you know that.&quot; She 
remarked uneasy about her sisters increasing peculiar nature, &quot;I will 
never understand you, even with you being my twin. Well, let us get a 
move on then.&quot; She stepped over to the dead boy and grabbed him by a 
foot, &quot;Someone willing to help me here?&quot; She pleaded. 

&quot;I&#39;ll dig the hole bigger!&quot; Alison exclaimed, grabbing the shovel from 
where her sister&#39;s had planted it and skipping ahead. 

&quot;I guess that leaves me.&quot; Alice said with a sigh as she reluctantly 
grabbed a hold of her cousin&#39;s leg and prepared to heave, &quot;You know 
there is a better way to dispose of him then burying him here, Lady 
Alexandria&quot; She commented. 

&quot;Burning him is out of the question.&quot; Alex returned coolly, &quot;We do not 
want to attract to much attention so close to my home, now do we?&quot; She 
inquired giving the girl a knowing glance. 

&quot;Darn.&quot; Alice responded dismally. She enjoyed the way the flames crawled 
across a human body, but she knew that Alexandria was right. Alex had 
been the brain of the group of little killers since they first met three 
years ago, seeing as the twins were years older then Alice she respected 
their decisions when it came to who to kill and how to dispose of the 
evidence. She was just glad that they allowed her to be part of the fun. 
She found herself glancing over at her friend as they dragged her 
cousin&#39;s body through the graveyard. A blush came across her face as she 
realized she was staring at the girl when Alison&#39;s screams shattered the 
silence of the graveyard. Both girls dropped what they were doing to run 
to Alison&#39;s side. They found the girl standing before the shallow grave 
that only moments before they had been digging. She was pale white and 
shaking violently. 

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Alexandria asked distressed by the look of fear that 
was etched across her sister&#39;s face, &quot;You look as if you have seen a 
ghost.&quot; 

&quot;I... h.. have...&quot; Alison shakily said and pointed at the bottom of the 
hole in front of them, that which now stood emptiness. Were before lay 
the body of Amanda were now only signs of a person clawing at the edge 
of the pit and muddy foot prints could be seen leaving the hole. 
Alexandria and Alice exchanged fear filled glances as they wondered what 
could have happened to the body.
