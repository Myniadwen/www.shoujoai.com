<p>VOLUME SIX: UNDER LOCK AND KEY</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“The Nail of Saigrim: a grave  situation?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The first place everybody headed to  once they boarded the <em>Dauntless</em> was the washroom. Spending the  better part of a week on a harsh planet, building up sweat and grime,  forced away from perfumes and lotions, had caused some serious damage  to the crew’s hygiene, and sadly, Kyrie was the very last to wash  up (yes, even <em>she</em> had missed the cleansing touch of water),  since she was required to keep the water hot. Twenty-two people  showering at the same time really takes a toll on plumping. At least  they were all alive and healthy, although it would be a stretch to  say that any of them were <em>well</em>: Lyara, Rebecca, and Riene kept  their distance from each other, and rarely even spoke to the other  crewmembers. Sharyn’s heart went out to the Valar’s, and they  shared another bath together in the hot springs, while Rebecca sought  solace in Eve’s world-weary presence, and Riene battled against her  demons alone. Her thoughts turned to Sati as she stood underneath the  weeping spigot.</p>
<p>Most of the women were in high  spirits, though, particularly Amy, who felt ten times better after  Fuuka reexamined her foot. The crew was surprised to see their frail  little friend in such great condition, particularly because she was  the least accustomed to wilderness survival, and she had faced the  elements by herself (she didn’t tell anyone about her “encounter”).  Because Amy’s foot had to be examined for infections and further  hemorrhaging, she had been one of the last to clean up, so the public  shower room was all hers. She took off her broken glasses first,  reminding herself to buy a new pair, and undid her braids until her  bland brown hair was free once more. She disrobed, a monotonous  ceremony, and set the water to a cooler temperature, stepping  underneath it with a gasp. Ah, that felt better! She groped around  for a razor and lathered her legs, embarrassed that she had let them  “go feral” for so long.</p>
<p>When she finished shaving her right  leg, Amy heard the washroom door opening, and wondered who her  visitor could be. Kyrie was probably still at the boiler, and Fuuka  and Athena were sharing a shower in their room. It wouldn’t be  Rachel— she didn’t need to bathe— and surely nobody was so  neurotic that they would shower <em>twice</em>. She looked up just in  time to notice Chandra coming in, letting her terry cloth robe ripple  down her skin as she explored the showers. Her eyes met Amy’s, and  she made a beeline for the stall next to hers. In the few moments it  took to make those few steps, Chandra soaked in the older woman’s  simple, beautiful nudity.</p>
<p>For starters, she looked more mature  with her hair hanging straight and her glasses abandoned, and was no  longer merely attractive: Miracle could be beautiful as well. But she  would never be stunning, arresting, or even gorgeous: she was pale  from too many years spent in libraries and </p>
<p>classrooms, and though she was  skinny, her body had some fat as well, since her tummy and hips  bulged a little. There were no visible muscles on her limns, and her  rear was flat and unappealing. Amy’s bosom was still in full bloom,  albeit small, and she balanced like a turtle struggling to right  itself as she shaved her leg. Hers was a very realistic, plain  beauty, like a loaf of warm bread and butter, but Chandra lusted  after her all the same.</p>
<p>“I can help you if you like,”  she offered. Amy breathed a sigh of relief. Shaving her left leg had  been difficult ever since she was inflicted with her injury,  especially her upper thighs. Putting any weight on her right foot was  usually out of the question; normally she just sat in a tub to  perform this chore, or relied on Rachel.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you! That’s so sweet  of you. Ugh, here. Say, pleasure units don’t have to worry about  that sort of thing, do they?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully not,” Chandra said  as she knelt down to trim the rest. She was now enticingly close to  Amy’s private area, a humble tuft of sweet angelic fuzz guarding  her womanhood, and if she had any less restraint, Chandra would’ve  leaned closer to fulfill her desires. But haste makes waste; she  wanted to savor every moment, and right now, massaging Amy’s legs  and washing the foam off was perfect enough.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t be able to primp  myself like that so much,” Chandra sighed. “I don’t see how you  all can bear that.”</p>
<p>“Well, we don’t do it every  day,” Amy smiled, “and I’m one of the lucky ones. This is as  bad as it gets for me.” Chandra grinned sweetly and reached out to  caress the silky smoothness.</p>
<p>“You <em>are</em> lucky…and  unbelievably sexy.” Amy giggled.</p>
<p>“You’re just saying that.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean it. You’re petite  but very pretty. There, that’s the last of it. It’s like velvet  now. Would you like me to wash your back, or your hair?”</p>
<p>“Oh, both, please!” Chandra  chuckled sensually and stood, placing herself directly behind Amy,  focusing her eyes on the womanly treasure. Every millimeter of a  lady’s body was an ode to beauty, and Chandra’s senses were tuned  in to appreciate them to their fullest. She poured soap on her bare  palms and massaged with the experience of a professional, caressing  Amy’s bare back, shoulders, neck, arms…even slithering down to  her bottom.</p>
<p>“Ahh! Hey! I can get that part  just fine!”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Chandra giggled, “it’s  just so cute! And now for your hair.”</p>
<p>“Oh, this’ll be fun,” Amy  sighed as she felt firm fingers clawing through her mane. She hadn’t  felt this good since she was a young child, when her mother used to  wash her hair in the kitchen sink. She became so absorbed in the  purity of the moment that she failed to notice Chandra’s </p>
<p>kisses, jumping from her ear to her  neck, over her cheek and finally, as silky hands touched her breasts,  onto her lips, where they rested for one heavenly second. Amy backed  away in surprise and revulsion, her eyes livid.</p>
<p>“Don’t!” she hissed. “I’m  not like that, Chandra. Goodness, if I had known this would happen so  many times, I would’ve just told everyone up front on the first  day!”</p>
<p>“You mean you’re not a lesbian?”  she giggled.</p>
<p>“No!! I’m sorry if you got the  wrong impression, but I’m not like that at all! I just want us to  be friends— that’s it.”</p>
<p>“That’s no fun,” Chandra  pouted. “Aren’t you curious in the least? It’s actually very  pleasant.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure it is,” Amy sighed,  stepping out of the shower and heading for the towel rack, “but  what’s fine for you isn’t fine for everyone else, and I hate that  you assumed so much.” She covered herself so Chandra wouldn’t be  tempted anymore, then ran a second towel over her hair, arms, and  legs. “I love each and every one of you dearly, and that will never  change. I don’t care if the whole lot of you are lesbians, I really  don’t, and if you can do some real good and find some genuine  happiness out of that, it’s wonderful. It’s your right and your  life, but if you want people to respect that, you have to respect  theirs as well.”</p>
<p>“Sounds boring,” Chandra sighed.  She wasn’t quite as conservative and, after shutting the water off,  she claimed only one towel and took her time drying off. “How can  you know you really don’t like something unless you try it?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t the first time a  girl’s kissed me,” Amy grumbled, almost comically. “<em>Believe</em> me, Chandra, I know what I want. If you can’t even respect  people’s…” Amy interrupted herself, jerked her head around  suddenly, and stared at Chandra with unalloyed pity. “Oh, Chandra,  you’ve never loved anybody, have you?”</p>
<p>She knew the pleasure unit would  laugh out loud. On the surface, it did seem like a silly thing to  ask.</p>
<p>“Did that steamy kiss of ours  really do so much damage? Or have you forgotten just what I was made  for? I’ll admit, it wasn’t exactly my <em>choice</em>, but I’ll  run with it all the same.”</p>
<p>“So just how many women have you  been with? Just give me an estimate.”</p>
<p>“I’m not even sure I could do  that,” Chandra sang proudly. “It’s definitely well over a  hundred, maybe 275. And for your information, I loved every single  one of them.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t love them,” Amy  sighed as she combed her hair. “Can you remember any of their  names?” Chandra’s face darkened.</p>
<p>“A handful, sure.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“How about their personalities?  What about their fears? Do you remember what their favorite food was,  or what music they hated? How about their homes, or their families?”</p>
<p>“I see the point you’re trying  to make,” Chandra groaned, frustrated and impatient. This  inquisition had stopped being fun a long time ago.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you do,” Amy  stated as she started to dress herself. She hid behind one of the  stalls so Chandra wouldn’t see, not that the nymphomaniac was  interested anymore. “You may have <em>thought</em> you cared about a  few of them, but I promise you, Chandra, if we made a list of every  woman you slept with, you wouldn’t be able to point out a single  one you actually loved. Let me finish,” she gestured as Chandra  protested. “In order for me to fully explain, I’d have to tell  you what real love is, because I’m sure you don’t know. Love is  more powerful and more painful than hate. It stems from unreasonable  passion and leads to illogical tenacity. Love is about sacrifices,  and doing what is best for your partner, even if that means giving  them up entirely. Love is staying by their side even when it hurts.  It’s patient and generous, and it will last beyond the limits of  beauty and desire, beyond needing and wanting, beyond distance and  measure. To love someone is to forsake yourself for <em>them</em>, and  I do not believe you have ever felt that way about anybody.</p>
<p>“I’ve probably said something  that offended you, so I’ll leave you to your thoughts. But know  this, Chandra: I am a long, long way from loving anybody like that.  Sometimes, everyone on this ship infuriates me so much that I just  want to throw them out and forget about them. But…they’re  precious to me. They came here because they <em>wanted</em> to. The  very least I can do is love them for their devotion. I hope one day,  you understand what I mean. We’ll be arriving at Saigrim in a few  hours, so I’m going to take a nap and get a bite to eat. If you’d  like to talk, please wait until I get back.”</p>
<p>And thus, Chandra was left alone  with those words haunting her.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Naja was impressed that Amy actually  kept her promise, and finally gave the meek woman a rare measure of  Elshyrin respect. The two of them were ready to descend ti Saigrim  until they were stopped by the only other friends Naja had onboard:  Lillianne and Aseria. This dangerous duo proposed to come along for  the adventure, and vowed they would do everything they could to help  Naja retrieve her item and ward away her fiancé.</p>
<p>“How sweet!” amy exclaimed.  Aseria giggled, but Lil rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t get the wrong idea,  Miracle! Naja’s the only other person on this flying junk heap that  actually gets me, and I’ll be damned if she wastes her life slaving  away for some bastard.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You enjoy fucking each other too  much,” Aseria sighed coldly. Lil was unperturbed.</p>
<p>“Hell yeah! Of course it’s a  matter of sex! Even you have a tough time keeping up! Besides, the  Mun worshipped snakes as gods, so it’s like a fucking dream come  true!” Everyone laughed at the delightful entendre, even Amy, and  agreed that at the very least, four would be better-suited for this  mission than two. Since two of the most unpopular members of the crew  were going along, nobody else decided to join them; on the other  hand, the few that still doubted Amy’s strength and integrity were  silenced at last. Anyone who could handle being around this  terrifying triumvirate must have nerves of steel and a glacier’s  patience. Amy just hoped she could <em>keep</em> those qualities as the <em>Dauntless</em> settled down and the four women disembarked.</p>
<p>Saigrim was unlike any world the  crew had visited so far. The first thing the four women saw was a  great wall of stone, a mesa that rose up like a mountain, amber in  the afternoon light. The image of a gargantuan creature, a humanoid  titan with the head of a serpent, had been carved into the mesa,  welcoming them to his world. There were other colossi scattered  around in very rigid formations, some even bigger than the first,  others only about five meters tall. They had all been chiseled into  (or out of) the same red stones: mighty gods with dozens of eyes,  humble servants kneeling before lords and ladies, frightening demons  with tusks and fire for hair, benevolent entities with seven heads,  meditating sages waving a multitude of arms, solemn guards towering  so high that they almost blotted out the sun, and finally, an entire  garden filled with these idols, one of them boldly waving his  oversized genitalia in greetings.</p>
<p>“Groos,” Naja snorted as she  covered her face. Amy giggled.</p>
<p>“It’s a standard fertility  symbol, Naja. The ancient races from Gaea did the exact same thing.”</p>
<p>“So they were a bunch of  dick-worshipping cultists?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly,” Amy grinned as  she pointed to another statue— a nude woman standing firmly on the  ground, her legs spread apart and her breasts large with potential.  “Fertility works two ways.”</p>
<p>“Not on my home world,” Aseria  boasted as they made their way past the garden. “Homosexuality has  been a practice of ours for centuries. For those couples who wish it,  they can breed a child based on the combined genetic structure of  both parents. It’s sort of like cloning, only much more refined.”</p>
<p>“Test tube babies?” Naja  cringed. “Eww, now that sounds disgusting. I don’t <em>ever</em> want to have children.”</p>
<p>“Never?” Lil said as she wrapped  her arm around Naja’s scaly shoulders. The Elshyrin was adamant.</p>
<p>“Ugh, no. For one thing, it’s  custom on Jelrin for the children to usurp their parents, and  siblings fight each other for their approval. Do I <em>look</em> like I  want that shit thrown on me?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind having a few  babies,” Aseria cooed. “I was actually hoping that Aria and I  could conceive. Naja, are you <em>sure?</em> I’d love to have a  Sindar-Elshyrin mixed son.”</p>
<p>“And a Mun-Sindar daughter,  right?” Aseria smiled sweetly and licked Lil’s lips, the closest  she ever got to honest affection. Naja groused angrily, and for once,  preferred the company of (shudder) other people.</p>
<p>“You people are making me sick!  Just…sick, sick, sick!! RRAAGGH!! Let’s go, Amy! You won’t  gross me out with your parental instincts, will you?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do my best,” she  muttered feebly. In all honesty, Amy wanted to be a mother as well,  but she wasn’t going to admit this with Naja the way she was.  Another time.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Moving along, the four women left  the garden behind and ventured into what was once a courtyard. The  tiled roads were cracked and broken, and grasses sprouted freely,  some slithering up the sides of ancient pillars. There were three  small shelters in the courtyard (nobody knew what else to call them),  their domed roofs supported by columns that still stood against time  and disrepair, and a fountain was in the center, rusted and filthy  with algae. A few rodents, rabbits, and snakes were seen, and birds,  insects, and spiders flitted in and out of the ruins, but on the  whole, the area was totally deserted. Soon, the women learned the  fate of the world’s inhabitants, as they moved from the courtyard  into a temple. Naja shrieked as she recognized the Elshyrin’s  ancestors on the relief— but what was most startling was the  revelation that they had been slaughtered and forced to abandon their  world: there were pictures of war and great flying machines on the  temple walls, and the very last picture was most startling, something  that chilled even Naja’s blood:</p>
<p>A victorious Kitsune holding the  fabled Nail aloft.</p>
<p>“That solves a few riddles,” Lil  whispered as she touched the image. She gave Naja a look that  bordered on sympathy, and she even reached out in an attempt to  comfort her. “You want I should defile this piece?”</p>
<p>“Leave it,” she murmured darkly,  turning around to explore the temple’s inner lair. “If another  member of my kind…of <em>our</em> kind comes here, they’ll want to  know how this happened. Come on, this isn’t what we came here for.  Amy!”</p>
<p>“I’m coming,” she sighed,  hobbling along helplessly. The Elshyrin are a fast species, and Naja  was almost going to full speed, brimming with righteous anger and  determination. She had to remind herself that Fuuka, and the Kitsune  in general, were the least of her concerns. Right now she had to  secure her freedom, even if that meant teaming up with others.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“I’m here,” Amy gasped as she  finally caught up with Naja (she was only able to achieve this  because Naja had stopped). Gracious, you…shouldn’t go quite…so  fast! It’s hard…for us to keep…up!”</p>
<p>“Sorry for storming off like  that,” Naja mumbled. Her entire being had softened, from her  relaxed shoulders to her loosened fists, and even her voice was low  and civil. She had learned a secret about her ancestors and allowed  her rage to explode, but also wanted to be focused and pure— a  metal to be shaped after being smelted. Because Amy was now one of  the few people she honestly respected, Naja could afford to be  remorseful.</p>
<p>“You know, you’re being very  sweet by coming along. I know it’s partially my fault we’ve been  delayed so long, and I know…I have no right to tell you what to do.  It’s your ship and your rules— you just gave us all a lot of  freedom. And even after all the shit I put the others through, you’re  still willing to come along. Hell, you even went through a week of  survival by yourself in that godsforsaken world! You know, when I  first signed up for this stupid road trip, I didn’t think a pussy  like you would last three days. Heh…gods, I couldn’t have been  more wrong. You’re the toughest bitch I’ve ever met…and the  nicest. Ahh, I wish we had met sooner, Amy.”</p>
<p>“Please,” she beamed, “don’t  put me on such a high pedestal! You have no idea how frail I really  am! It takes everything I have just to <em>walk</em>, for pity’s  sake. And confidentially, I didn’t even think I’d last three <em>hours</em>, let alone three days. It’s only because I have the  best crew in the galaxy with me that I got this far.”</p>
<p>“The best?” Naja coughed. “Ha!  Maybe four or five of us. Ah, and speaking of, here come the  lovebirds. Don’t you two realize we’re on a deadline here?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t aware of any  deadline,” Aseria said innocently.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you never told us we were  in a hurry,” Lil huffed. Naja glared like a woman scorned.</p>
<p>“Duh! My arranged marriage! <em>Hello!</em> I’m not the one who set the time, and if I’m not there for the  ceremonies, I’ll lose all my wealth, titles, status, everything!  Shit, they might even kill me! So you’d better move your lazy asses  if you wanna keep me around! I mean, damn! Even <em>Amy</em> got here  faster than you two! What the hell <em>kept</em> you, anyway? Don’t  tell me you snuck off to have a quickie!”</p>
<p>“Actually, we thought we saw  somebody,” Aseria muttered stiffly. “We were delayed because we  investigated.”</p>
<p>“And?” They shook their heads.  Nothing. “So you just wasted your time. Fine, be that way. I’m  not going to allow you to hold me back! Come on, Amy: at least <em>you</em> can keep up with me.”</p>
<p>“Barely,” she squeaked as she  started to limp again. Aseria and Lillianne followed at a distance,  nursing their pride. “So how do you know where to go?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I can smell it!” Naja hissed.  “The Nail has a distinct aroma; I read about it in an old book.  It’s supposed to have a unique odor that any Elshyrin will  recognize at once. I caught it right away when we landed, and I’ve  been following it ever since. It’s very strong now. Hey, lovebirds!  Maybe <em>you</em> can be our lookout since you’re already accustomed  to jumping at shadows!”</p>
<p>“Bitch,” Aseria sighed. Lil  grinned.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but that’s what makes her  so gosh-darned sexy.” Aseria sighed and pressed on, lighting  torches the deeper in they dove. Unlike so many of their previous  adventures, there were no traps, tricks, switches, or levers to worry  about, and nothing guarded the Nail of Saigrim except the emptiness  and stillness.</p>
<p>“That makes sense!” Naja crowed  proudly. “If my ancestors really did build this place, they  wouldn’t need such lowly subterfuge! They’d just swarm the  invaders with superior might! There must have been <em>piles</em> of  Kitsune bodies during the last battle!”</p>
<p>“Ssh,” Aseria hissed.</p>
<p>“Don’t shush me! I don’t  interrupt you when you’re bitching about <em>your</em> people, do I?”</p>
<p>“I think I heard something, too,”  Amy whispered. Naja sighed and came to a halt, but only because she  liked the older woman and trusted her judgment. Elvish ears are  sharp, but if Amy heard it (over Naja’s raving, no less), that  meant the disturbance was close. Everyone put their guard up and  waited, listening and watching carefully. The shadows at the end of  the room danced, and a figure emerged from them, silent and dark as  the void itself, limply carrying a sickle-and-chain in its hand.</p>
<p>“Not such a waste of time anymore,  huh?” Lil muttered. Aseria rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Shut up. I recognize this person.  Look!” she thrust a beam of magical light at them, causing the  figure to shirk from the glare. It was a young lady, completely  covered with a black cloak, and a hood was cast over most of her  face. The women could see her mouth and nose, but the eyes were  hidden. Gradually, the memory of this entity began to surface, until  everyone realized who this was.</p>
<p>“Aw, shit! You’re the psycho  reaper chick we saw on that planet! Uh, uh…damn, what’s its  name?”</p>
<p>“Rajani,” Aseria said. “If  memory serves, she calls herself Grave, the New Angel of Death.”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” the entity  whispered, her voice raspy and distant. “We have all come a long  way since our last encounter, but I shall not fail today. Lillith of  Mu, your time has come. Accept your fate and follow me to the other  side.”</p>
<p>“Like hell I will!!” she roared,  moving into a fighting stance. Aseria stood next to her partner,  unveiling a much larger scythe, glowing blue with magical energy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You will have to get through me  first, demon.” She expected Naja to pop up and join the defense,  but the Elshyrin was running in the <em>opposite</em> direction,  laughing and shrieking.</p>
<p>“Okay, have fun with your new  friend! If I don’t see you again, I’ll avenge your deaths! Let’s  find that Nail, Amy!” Miracle’s integrity kept her from bolting,  even though she knew she didn’t stand a chance against this  creature.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Naja, but I can’t  abandon them. I want to confront her as well.”</p>
<p>“Confront?” Aseria snarled, her  muscles tensing as she prepared to pounce. “I’m going to <em>kill</em> the fucker!” Aseria flew into the air and swung, but the grave  woman was blindingly fast, and delivered her own stroke in a single,  fluid flash, cutting deep into the Sindar’s abdomen. Aseria fell to  the ground, coughing and bleeding; Amy hopped after her and stood  directly in front of a stunned Lil, arms stretched out and eyes  defiant. Grave merely slapped her away, sending her to join the elf;  Naja saw her new friend going down, and an unfamiliar boiling rage,  the kind many cold-blooded Elshyrin never know, filled her up and  sent her shrieking.</p>
<p>“You’re gonna regret that, you  fucking psycho! I’ll send you screaming back to Hell!” Before  Naja could perform any heroics, however, Grave thrust her sickle and  chain out, wrapping it around Naja’s waist. She stumbled and  coughed, the blade coldly tickling her scales, and screamed as Grave  flung her makeshift whip around, slamming her victim into the wall,  where she collapsed and laid still.</p>
<p>This was much more than a disturbing  chain of events for Lillianne Markus. Naja and Aseria were two of the  strongest people she knew (the third being herself), and yet this  devilish monster had defeated them effortlessly. She remembered  fighting Grave on Rajani— how futile all her efforts had been—  and she wondered if now, after growing and learning a little bit  about the world, she could win. Grave didn’t wait for her to  approach any realizations: she stepped closer, her pace casual,  materializing a scythe as large as she was from a pillar of shrieking  white fire. Lil gnashed her teeth together and charged, feinting her  directions randomly in the hopes of throwing this abomination off her  guard. Grave simply stood back and watched patiently, waiting for Lil  to tire herself out. Her foot suddenly lashed out, but Grave was  amazingly fast, and snapped her weapon with such intense precision  that it carved right through the leg. Lil screamed and rushed at  Grave with her whole body, trailing pools of pure sapphire blood that  would have Fuuka screaming.</p>
<p>What happened next was really too  fast for the eye to see, so words are best to describe it. Lil threw  a hard punch that was guaranteed not to miss, but Grave whirled  around once again, digging her scythe right into the knuckles and  cleaving the arm in two. Before a single drop of azure blood could  touch the ground, Grave spun around, winding her scythe up, and  lopped off Lil’s head with a magnificent gesture, standing  victorious as her foe’s life-force spewed out. The body fell to the  ground and Aseria screamed; Naja balled her fists up, still too  beaten to put up a decent fight; Amy covered her mouth and shut her  eyes, shivering with fright.</p>
<p>“How many was that?” Grave  whispered absently. “She said it was ‘number four’ the last  time, so that must’ve been five. She’s halfway there.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Mother-fucking demon!” Aseria  struggled to stand, and threw her strongest spell of devastation at  the murderous scum. Grave shrieked— she knew even she could not  survive that— and flew out of the spell’s path, narrowly avoiding  destruction. A clean, perfect hole was punched through the wall where  the spell landed, and a shaft of light poured in, striking the Angel  of Death</p>
<p>“Why in Heaven’s name did you <em>do</em> that?!” Amy shrieked as she climbed to her feet. Naja was slowly  recovering as well, but her anger was gone: there was nothing she  could use it for anymore. Grave removed her hood, revealing a very  normal-looking girl’s face, sunken with a depression too great to  imagine.</p>
<p>“Because I’m the new Angel of  Death, and as much as I hate it, I still have a job to do. If you  want to kill me, you’re more than welcome to, but I must warn you:  it will only bring you even greater suffering. I was assigned to take  this woman’s life because it is her time to die, nothing else.”</p>
<p>“But who gives you the right?”  Naja growled, dizzily standing up. She leaned against the wall and  shook her head, regaining her senses. There was no malice in Grave’s  eyes or words: she truly felt horrible for what she had been forced  to do.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the last Angel of  Death did. It’s too long a story to tell, and anyway, she’s  coming around.”</p>
<p>“Coming around?! You’re even  more insane than you look! She’s <em>dead</em>, you fucking idiot!”</p>
<p>“Not yet,” Aseria moaned. What  happened next was beyond shock or horror: it was something abominable  and even vulgar. Lillianne’s body started going into mild seizures,  and her severed body parts, leg and head, flopped and bounced around  on the floor, slowly being drawn back towards the body. All the blood  she had spilt began pouring back, and gradually, flesh, skin, muscle,  and bone were grafted together again. The leg flew back into place,  sewing up the seams quickly, and the arm repaired itself, clasping  together with a grotesque slurp. Amy couldn’t watch the rest; she  turned away and moaned. Aseria looked like she had seen this before,  however, and a grim look of determination flashed in her eyes.  Finally, Lil’s body recovered itself, and a flash of light gave the  woman back her existence.</p>
<p>She gasped desperately and coughed  for about thirty seconds before focusing her rage on Grave. A  sinister smile curled on her lips: “Well, isn’t this a funny  show? Nobody’s ever managed to kill me <em>twice</em>. Think you got  what it takes to make it an even three?”</p>
<p>“Don’t tempt her, Lillith,”  Aseria barked. “This creature is one of the most powerful entities  I’ve ever faced. If Aria were here, maybe we could win…”</p>
<p>“Bah, we don’t need your bitch  of a half-sister here to save us! I’ll just plow through her next  attack and rip that pretty little head out!”</p>
<p>“You’ll lose, fool!” Grave  snapped, swinging her sickle and chain around. “Just surrender! Why  waste your remaining five chances in a pointless battle?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Pointless?!”</p>
<p>“Five chances?”</p>
<p>“That’s enough!” Nobody  expected Amy to come running in— yes, <em>running— </em>least of  all Grave, which was why her guard was down. Amy took that rare  opportunity and actually kicked the woman in the jaw with her bad  foot, spewing blood everywhere. Most of it was hers— she almost  tripped as she regained her bearings— but there was also a trickle  running down Grave’s mouth, and she wiped it off in amazement. Naja  nearly had babies.</p>
<p>“Holy shit! You kick ass, Amy!”</p>
<p>“I just want your attention,”  she gasped, wincing from pushing herself too far. Amy showed Grave  her wounded foot, which was apparently a startling revelation, for  she shrieked and backed away, clutching her weapons greedily. “Aha,  so you do know what this is! I didn’t want to do this, but you’ve  pushed me too far! In the name of Maleldil, I command you to listen  to me!”</p>
<p>A paralyzing sensation washed over  the group, and even if a gorgon had slithered by, they would not have  been able to tell the difference between these women and an earlier  victim. Strange, horrifying emotions stabbed their hearts, and they  felt like cowering, running away— but not before obeying what the  bold woman had to say. Grave was the first to move, and she snarled  with alarming respect.</p>
<p>“Your masters have given you  dangerous toys to play with, woman. Very well, I shall listen to what  you have to say, but know this: I cannot go back on my duties.”</p>
<p>“Nor would I ask you to,” Amy  said gently. “But Lil is my friend, and she’s a member of my  crew. She has the name <em>Dauntless</em> forever etched upon her soul.  We are on a mission, dearest Arine— that is your real name, isn’t  it?— and we cannot have our crewmembers perishing before the  mission is complete. I promise that once we are finished, you may  fulfill your oath. But not a moment sooner.”</p>
<p>“An arrogant request,” she  muttered darkly— but there was no mistaking the look of joy that  fell upon her. She even smiled. “None of you will be able to escape  me in the end. I promise to stay my touch until you are finished,  Miracle, but you had better be prepared to see me when this is all  over. I pray I shall not have any excuse to meet your companions  beforehand. Until then, doctor— and Lillith. Do treasure those  final five lives of yours. No doubt each one will be more precious  than the last.”</p>
<p>She saluted and vanished, naturally  leaving everyone with plenty of questions. Naja decided to put them  aside for later, since she really only cared about getting the Nail,  and with no further obstacles, she sniffed her way to the treasure.  Saigrim’s most famous treasure was a curved fingernail protruding  out of a skeletal finger, sharp as a saber and potent enough to  silence the most stubborn Elshyrin. Now Naja just had to hope her  family would accept this treasure in exchange for her freedom. If  not…</p>

<p>Amy Miracle sighed wearily as she  ducked underneath the cool spray of water: she had forgotten how  messy adventures could get. She promised to “fill in all the  blanks” once she was out; she just needed some time to herself  before the interview. As she washed her body free from worry and  anxiety, she heard the washroom door opening, and feared that Chandra  had returned, ignoring Amy’s advice. Really, though, it might have  been better for her if this were true. A happy, inquisitive, nude  Naja greeted her instead.</p>
<p>“Hey, need someone to wash your  back?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, not again!!”</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Kyrie: I deserve to be the star next  time since all I did in this chapter was work!</p>
<p>Lyara: Yes, but you did such a  marvelous jobs with the baths!</p>
<p>Sharyn: Aye, Lyara and I were <em>very</em> cozy.</p>
<p>Lyara: You should invent a system  that replicates the sensation of being in a hot spring. You’ll make  a fortune!</p>
<p>Kyrie: Really? Well, I have been  wanting to study heating and cooling…</p>
<p>Alala: Hey, slackers! None of this  has anything to do with the next chapter!</p>
<p>Sharyn: But milady, we’re so warm  and toasty in this bath! Prithee, won’t you join us?</p>
<p>Alala: Myow, NO, too many prying  eyes.</p>
<p>Yenae:</p>
<p>Alala: I SEE YOU HIDING BACK  THERE!!</p>
<p>Kyrie: …Uh, ahem. Anyway, the next  chapter has the crew visiting…HUH? A world made entirely out of  corpses?!</p>
<p>Sharyn: Pleasant.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lyara: That means we’ll have to  take another toasty bath when we get back.</p>
<p>Sharyn: Huzzah! May our sexuality be  ever ambiguous behind the mists of our open-air baths!</p>
<p>Kyrie: Um, okay, maybe I DON’T  want to be star next time. Somebody else can have it!</p>
<p>Alala: Ooh, me, me! I heard that  Marsa Rosemont will be returning! She’s my hero!</p>
<p>Yenae: All the more reason for us to  go down there, lemon pie! A beautiful priestess and a chance to take  a nice, hot bath afterward!</p>
<p>Lyara: And corpses! More than you  can shake a stick at! But see for yourself in, “Corpse World: the  morbid, the merrier!”</p>
<p>Sharyn: Is this stick big enough?  (she whips out a big stick!)</p>
<p>Kyrie: KYRIE MUST BURN WOOD! FLAME  ON!!</p>
<p>Yenae: Quick, Alala! Take off your  clothes so they don’t burn, and jump into the water!</p>
<p>Alala: …………I’ll take my  chances.</p>
