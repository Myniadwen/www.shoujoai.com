<a href="../original/exileroad-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The thick windows distorted the rays of the morning
sun, but the light was still enough to rouse Jantha
from her sleep. The elegant blonde fought back a yawn
as she sat up, rubbing the sleep from her eyes as she
pushed the thin woolen covers away. Rising from the
bed her nightgown hung over her body, the thin cloth
warm and comfortable. She made her way to her dresser,
using the basin of water left there to wash her face
and hands, drying them with a towel.

&#39;I wonder how my new guardians are doing?&#39; Jantha
mused.

Diner last night had been remarkably civilized with
Midori and Laur&#39;ien, both women seeming on their best
behavior. The tawny haired Laur&#39;ien had even seemed to
charm some forgiveness from Jantha&#39;s personal maid
Elise, somehow. Conversation had stayed neutral,
pleasant, and both ladies showed a remarkable depth of
knowledge, especially Midori.

&#39;Midori,&#39; Jantha walked to her closet, wondering what
to make of the intense foreigner. Picking out a set of
riding pants and a fine blouse she dressed, the black
haired woman not far from her restless thoughts.

Jantha and her bodyguard had only reluctantly entered
the bar called the Drunken Bard, just hoping to escape
the storm. Taking a corner table she ordered the only
passable wine they offered, watching the crowd warily
until she first spotted her. With merely a glance
Midori stopped two fighters, softly spoken words
sending them back to their seats. Tall as a man,
dressed in her usual leathers she dominated the room,
Midori radiating a strength and confidence few could
match. Her dark hair and pale skin, the cast of her
features, they all marked her as an outlander.

&quot;Who is that?&quot; Jantha had to ask the barman, feeling
the eyes of the customers on her.

The grizzled old soldier smiled slightly, wiping off
the bar smoothly. &quot;That&#39;s my bouncer, Midori,&quot; he
said, his gray hair short, thinning at the top, but
his arms still bulging with muscles, &quot;may I ask why
yer asking?&quot;

Jantha didn&#39;t blush, she had spent too much time in
politics for that, but she wanted to under his amused
gaze. &quot;Curiosity,&quot; she answered him evenly, &quot;I haven&#39;t
seen an outlander like her before.&quot;

&quot;Name&#39;s Garrison,&quot; the older man nodded, &#39;welcome to
my place.&quot; He smiled again, &quot;Shall I tell Midori about
who&#39;s curious in her?&quot;

&quot;Jan...&quot; she stopped herself then continued, &quot;Jane.&quot;

Garrison clearly noticed the hesitation but didn&#39;t
comment on it as he passed her glass of wine over.
&quot;Then I&#39;ll look forward to seeing you again,&quot; he said
gravely.

With dignity she returned to her seat, her bodyguard
looking on with pure disapproval. Jantha ignored him
as she watched Midori stop to speak with the bar for a
moment. They spoke a moment, he obviously pushing her
for something, then finally she relented. His lute was
well made, the tone and power stilling conversation,
then surprisingly Midori raised her voice in song as
well. It was an older ballad of love found and lost
the bard surprisingly taking the lady&#39;s part while
Midori easily carried the man&#39;s role, her voice smooth
as warm velvet.

Jantha found herself joining in the applause when they
finished, both taking their bows. Midori moved on to
the bar and bent her head to hear Garrison&#39;s words,
then raised her head. Garrison pointed Jantha out and
she felt Midori&#39;s eyes resting on her, weighing her
cautiously. Jantha raised her wine glass in salute,
taking a drink to hide any nervousness she might be
feeling.

&quot;We have to go, m&#39;lady,&quot; her bodyguard reminded her,
&quot;this isn&#39;t safe.&quot;

Jantha fought back her annoyance, but knew he was
right. &quot;Lead on,&quot; she picked up her still damp cloak
and slipped away into the storm.

In her bedroom Jantha made up her face carefully,
styling her blonde hair so that it fell in the waves
that were so popular this season. Her eyelids were
touched likely with shade, her lips made a bit more
rosy but other than that she left herself as nature
had made.

Ready for the day Jantha walked to her bedroom door
and opened it, only to look in surprise at the tawny
haired woman who was leaning up against the wall
there. Laur&#39;ien looked up at her with a smile, pushing
herself to stand up straight and salute, &quot;Morning,
Duchess.&quot;

&quot;Why are you...?&quot; Jantha started.

Laur&#39;ien fell into step behind Jantha as they went
towards the kitchen, &quot;Midori and I felt it would be
best to have someone standing guard outside your door,
just in case.&quot; She flashed a smile as they headed to
the rear of the house, &quot;In fact I offered to slip into
your room to guard you better, but Midori put her foot
down.&quot;

&quot;Thank the gods,&quot; Jantha sighed as she opened the door
to the kitchen, Laur&#39;ien just chuckling softly. &quot;And I
assume Midori is sleeping before she takes your
place?&quot;

Laur&#39;ien stifled a yawn as she said, &quot;I was just going
to suggest we go wake her, since she doesn&#39;t want you
left alone.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jantha felt a flutter of nervousness.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Elise smiled in greeting, giving Laur&#39;ien a
more wary look as the little redhead carried over a
cup of thick, dark coffee.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jantha nodded, shuddering slightly at the
taste as she gulped down some of the hot liquid.

&quot;It does taste better with cream and sugar, miss,&quot;
Elise said respectfully.

Jantha flashed a smile at her trusted servant,
&quot;Doesn&#39;t wake me up as well, though.&quot; Finishing off
her drink she set the cup on the stone counter,
&quot;Breakfast for two, in half an &#39;mark.&quot;

Elise gave a little nod, &quot;It&#39;ll be ready, m&#39;lady.&quot;

&quot;You mind waking me around noon?&quot; a smiling Laur&#39;ien
asked Elise, oddly without any of her normally bold
manner.

Elise looked at her thoughtfully, &quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;That went well,&quot; a thoughtful Jantha noted as they
entered the hallway, out of hearing range of the young
maid.

&quot;I&#39;m not so thick as to repeat my mistakes,&quot; Laur&#39;ien
answered dryly, leading the way this time. They made
their way over to the servant&#39;s wing where she rapped
on a door with her knuckles.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be quartered here,&quot; Jantha frowned,
&quot;neither of you are true servants.&quot;

&quot;Visit the barracks sometime,&quot; Laur&#39;ien looked amused
as they heard movement inside the room, &quot;this is
lovely in comparison.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Jantha blinked. The servant&#39;s quarters were
small rooms, mostly bare except for whatever the
resident brought in, and warmed by the kitchen stoves
not far away.

&quot;Morning,&quot; the door opened to reveal Midori, the
smiling woman looking still just a bit sleep rumpled.
Her short black hair had been carefully wetted down,
and her usual leathers covered the intense fighter&#39;s
form.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Laur&#39;ien went inside as Midori left, &quot;Elise will
be waking me around noon.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re sharing a room?&quot; Jantha asked, a confusing
rush of emotions filling her.

&quot;Not exactly,&quot; Midori said as they walked away, &quot;it&#39;s
not like we&#39;re going to be in the same room all that
often.&quot;

&quot;A good point,&quot; Jantha conceded. She looked up at
Midori hesitantly, &quot;Would you care to join me for
breakfast?&quot;

&quot;If it&#39;s as good as last night&#39;s dinner,&quot; Midori
answered with a smile, &quot;then I&#39;d love to.&quot;

Jantha smiled in amusement, &quot;I&#39;ll pass the compliment
on to Lisa and Chris, then.&quot;

&quot;So what are the plans for today?&quot; Midori asked as
they entered the dining room they had ate in last
night.

&quot;I&#39;ll need to visit the palace to see my cousin,&quot;
Jantha said as she gestured to seats near one end of
the long table, &quot;and find out what diplomatic duties
I&#39;ll be facing today.&quot;

&quot;You sound eager,&quot; Midori said as she sat down at
Jantha&#39;s side.

&quot;I find I enjoy it,&quot; Jantha admitted with a smile, &quot;it
reminds me of a game of strategy, each side
maneuvering to victory.&quot;


&quot;Ideally each side wins something,&quot; Midori noted.

Jantha looked over at Midori thoughtfully, &quot;Have you
been involved with diplomacy, then?&quot;

There was an odd look on Midori&#39;s face as she
answered, &quot;Once, long time ago.&quot;
