<h1>LoveStruck (part 7 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jpoulos.html">Jennifer Poulos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/lovestruck-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Heart had tried to watch television in the morning, but there were 
mostly religious services on, and she quickly found she couldn&#39;t abide 
their ridiculous posturing and bloated self-importance. She crawled back 
into bed with Seraph, who was still asleep and would probably not be up 
until early afternoon. Stretching out on the bed and cradling her head 
in her arm, she spent several hours merely observing the succubus, 
memorizing every curve of her face, every soft heave of breath, every 
strand of hair.

She fascinated over her high cheekbones, the arch of her lip. Every lash 
held new splendor, the cleft of her throat was a rapture, the softness 
of her bosom a treasure. She engrossed herself in the pale white skin of 
her torso, which arched so gracefully down her hips and became the 
treacherous power of her nimble legs. Her thighs were like sculpted 
marble, and made a graceful curve down to her calves, from there 
tapering down to her gleaming lilac hooves, which twitched so cutely for 
a moment as she seemed to be having a dream.

She longed so much to touch her, to wake her, to be able to talk, and 
cuddle, and laugh. She did not want to wake her because she didn&#39;t want 
to interrupt her fitful sleep. But she longed so much for Seraph&#39;s 
company that just being with her was well enough. Finally, after several 
sighs from the succubus, Heart realized she was awake.

&quot;Beloved?&quot; she asked, worried. &quot;I didn&#39;t wake you, did I?&quot;

Seraph rolled over. &quot;No, beloved, I&#39;ve been awake for about twenty 
minutes. How long have you been laying there?&quot;

&quot;Since I woke up,&quot; Heart replied with a smile.

&quot;Since sunrise?&quot; Seraph asked, shocked. &quot;What have you been doing all 
this time?&quot;

&quot;Gazing at you,&quot; Heart blushed. Seraph blushed, too.

&quot;Weren&#39;t you bored?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No, beloved,&quot; Heart smiled. &quot;I just wanted to be with you. I had fun 
watching you sleep! You&#39;re so beautiful.&quot;

Seraph turned even redder as she snuggled herself into the crook of 
Heart&#39;s arm.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you weren&#39;t bored,&quot; she rebutted.

Heart chuckled and squeezed the succubus.

&quot;Looking at you can never be boring,&quot; she said definitively, putting all 
end to the discussion.

They stayed in bed, arms wrapped around each other, for almost another 
hour, just enjoying the feel of each other&#39;s skin on their own. It made 
them both feel so comfortable, so secure, just lying there, just 
touching. The strength of their unity was expressed in their embrace, 
which only tightened as they occasionally nuzzled one another.

Finally, Seraph looked up at Heart with mischief in her eyes.

&quot;Are you ready to try the Jacuzzi yet?&quot;

Heart&#39;s eyes brightened at the suggestion.

&quot;Yes!&quot; she cried eagerly, jumping up and following Seraph into the 
bathroom.

Very quickly, Heart discovered that Mama was quite right to push the 
Jacuzzi as a selling point. She was sure that if this were the only 
splendor offered by their humble home, she would have been perfectly 
happy, as long as she could spend long hours luxuriating in this state. 
She and Seraph chatted about the possibility of going to the Central 
Park Zoo the next weekend, filling the earliest parts of the afternoon 
with delight.

Their recreation suffered a momentary interruption, however, when with a 
sudden urgent jingle, the phone rang. It startled Heart, who had never 
heard a phone ring before, but Seraph sighed and rose.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; she sighed. A few moments later, she reappeared at the 
bathroom door, and Heart noticed the gravity in her expression.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, worried that their day was spoilt.

Seraph shook her head. &quot;A pipe burst in the club, and the whole floor is 
covered in water.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no! You&#39;ll have to go in, won&#39;t you?&quot; Heart&#39;s tone of voice made 
her disappointment evident.

&quot;No, beloved,&quot; Seraph smiled. &quot;Tony&#39;s got it under control. He&#39;s got all 
the bouncers wet-vaccing the floor. He just wanted Thor&#39;s cell number.&quot;

&quot;Oh, goody!&quot; Heart clapped in delight. &quot;But those poor bouncers. Should 
we go in and help them?&quot;

&quot;Beloved, we&#39;re relaxing. It&#39;s Heart Rest Day,&quot; Seraph insisted. &quot;Tony 
was eager to do it. I think he&#39;s trying to brown-nose me, but at least 
he&#39;s doing a good job.&quot;

Heart blushed with the first comment, and was pleased to hear that Tony 
was obliging, but she felt it necessary to reprove Seraph for her 
character assessment. This only endeared Seraph into a passionate kiss, 
and a lot of splashing and giggling, as they settled into a day destined 
for them to enjoy each other.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Lipton had awakened to find breakfast had already been prepared, and 
Thor was flipping through an issue of a Guns and Ammo from Lipton&#39;s 
coffee table. He was not altogether happy finding the Thunder God in his 
apartment once again, but Thor&#39;s cheerful demeanor and clever 
observations were such a compliment to his own that he found he liked 
the big lug&#39;s company. The fact that Thor could cook much better than he 
could also inclined him not to ask the god to leave.

&quot;What the heck do you do for fun?&quot; Thor said when Lipton sat down, his 
hands full with a loaded plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, and pancakes.

&quot;Shoot guns. Fight with swords. Kickboxing. You know, totally 
unaggressive pursuits.&quot;

Thor chuckled. &quot;No, really, Lipton, what do you do when you&#39;re not 
working, or training for work?&quot;

Lipton sighed. &quot;Not much. Sit here and watch the world self-destruct.&quot;

&quot;Self-destruct? How?&quot; Thor was shocked at his friend&#39;s cynicism.

&quot;What do you mean how, Thor?&quot; Lipton demanded heatedly, brandishing his 
fork about as he gestured. &quot;Every day I go out there, and I see kids 
who&#39;ve been shot by other kids. I see girls who should be in eighth 
grade offering themselves to strangers for sex. I see mothers and 
fathers who have turned their children into cowering wrecks. Humanity 
sucks.&quot; Chuckling, and remembering who he was addressing, he added, &quot;I 
don&#39;t need to tell you that.&quot;

&quot;No, you don&#39;t, &#39;cuz I&#39;ll never believe it,&quot; Thor snapped back, but only 
in the spirit of the conversation. &quot;I see all those things, too. And I 
see other things. Look at what happened to this city with the World 
Trade Center! All those supplies that flooded in from all over the 
place, donated by people who weren&#39;t there&#151;&#148;

&quot;I&#39;d like to forget the World Trade Center, thank you,&quot; Lipton shot 
back. &quot;In my professional opinion, it was a shitty day.&quot;

Thor chuckled without mirth, catching his friend&#39;s meaning.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Lipton continued. &quot;Why can&#39;t people do that all the time? Why 
can&#39;t people be nicer to each other? It would make my job a helluva lot 
easier.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re not a total pessimist,&quot; Thor observed, astutely, &quot;because 
you have the job you do.&quot;

Lipton sighed. &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; he grudgingly agreed.

The gravity of the moment was relieved by a faint sound that grew louder 
as Thor removed its source from his pocket. That it was a cell phone 
amused Lipton, but the musical ring was &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; in 
digital beeps. Suppressing the urge to sing about killing rabbits, 
Lipton instead burst out laughing. He couldn&#39;t contain it all through 
Thor&#39;s conversation, which except for the greeting was mostly silent on 
his end.

&quot;Be right there,&quot; Thor said at the end.

Despite his disappointment at those words, Lipton couldn&#39;t resist 
delaying him a minute to poke some fun.

&quot;What the hell does a god need with a cell phone?&quot;

Thor shrugged. &quot;People might suspect I&#39;m not normal,&quot; he said, deadpan.

&quot;Yeah, but Thor &#151; &#39;Ride of the Valkyries&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Hey, any one o&#39; those girls could kick your ass, boy!&quot; Thor scolded 
good-naturedly. Sighing, he added, &quot;I gotta go to the club. They got a 
busted pipe, and we have to clean up the carpets before Miss Seraph&#39;s 
paintings are damaged. She&#39;d have a shit-fit if that happened.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t know?&quot; Lipton asked innocently.

&quot;She&#39;s not even there,&quot; Thor imparted. &quot;She&#39;s spending the day with Miss 
Heart. Alone.&quot; He emphasized the last with a pointed glare before 
exiting.

Lipton grinned when he shut the door. He quickly finished breakfast, 
showered, and dressed. He checked the ammo in his 9mm and his .38, 
slipped into his trench coat, grabbed several extra clips, and looked 
out the window. Grinning like the Cheshire cat, he too left the 
apartment and hurried downstairs, out to the street, and around to the 
alley. There, he poked at a small pile of rags &#151; one with a most 
suspicious halo that only he could see.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go see Seraph Darkfell,&quot; he said. Mary looked up at him in 
shock.

&quot;Why are you telling me?&quot; she demanded.

&quot;Because you&#39;re invited, if you promise to behave.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea,&quot; Mary cautioned. Lipton was 
immediately suspicious.

&quot;What did you do to her, Mary?&quot; he demanded in a voice that threatened 
wrath.

&quot;Nothing!&quot; Mary desperately protested. &quot;I just can&#39;t do it!&quot;

He grabbed her arm and pulled her to her feet. She made no protest as he 
walked her down the street, and even relaxed her glamour, smoothing out 
the rags into her normal attire.

&quot;Why can&#39;t you do it?&quot; he wanted to know.

&quot;Lipton,&quot; she warned, eyeing him. Then, sighing in resolution, she 
replied, &quot;I made a promise.&quot;

Lipton laughed. &quot;A promise! From you? All right, I get it now.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; She turned to him, color heightening in her cheeks.

&quot;You made a promise to leave her alone,&quot; Lipton said in a teasing voice. 
&quot;And of all people, you definitely keep your promises.&quot;

&quot;So then why don&#39;t you let go of my arm?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re coming with me,&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going alone, and I can&#39;t go with Thor. You&#39;re the only 
other supernatural being I&#39;m friends with. You don&#39;t have to do 
anything, just stand there and look all holy. All right?&quot;

Mary thought about it for a moment, thought about what had transpired 
the day before in her son&#39;s office, and her promise to him. She had said 
she wouldn&#39;t harm the succubus, but she had never said a thing about not 
paying the demon a visit. Besides, JC wouldn&#39;t make such a radical 
decision without reason; she knew him better than that. If there was a 
practical purpose for him leaving her alone, she wanted to see what it 
was.

In short, she wanted to see for herself this love from so unholy a 
creature.

&quot;Fine, whatever,&quot; she said, trying to sound much less eager than she 
felt. &quot;But if trouble starts, you&#39;re on your own.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I wanted to hear,&quot; Lipton grinned, and they both hastened to 
the Village.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Gabriel and Michael had passed a rather dull night atop the building 
that overlooked Lipton&#39;s, and had whiled away the hours playing gin 
rummy. That had worn thin, though, with the dawn, and finally, each of 
them had slipped into private reverie, neither one of them really 
needing sleep, and thus not bothering with it, as they might miss their 
target. Mary had not stirred all night, and she showed no signs of doing 
so all morning. Gabriel mused that the two might have to live there, if 
this kept up.

Michael&#39;s chuckle was cut short with an exclamation that made Gabriel 
wince. But the latter knew his partner&#39;s temper, and knew such words 
were reserved only for the severest of circumstances. He was immediately 
on his guard.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Thor&#39;s taking off,&quot; Michael pointed.

The big man was making his way down the street, talking on his cell 
phone. Gabriel raised an eyebrow.

&quot;I wonder why he&#39;s deserting his post,&quot; he said.

&quot;It better be pretty damn important,&quot; Michael began to fly off after 
Thor.

&quot;Wait! We&#39;re supposed to be watching the Scion!&quot; Gabriel protested, 
flying off after his partner.

&quot;I didn&#39;t trust that guy,&quot; Michael narrowed his eyes at the war god 
below. He had largely ignored Gabriel&#39;s protest, and was focused only on 
Thor now.

&quot;He must have a good reason,&quot; Gabriel urged.

&quot;Like I said &#151; he&#39;d better.&quot;

Michael was not to be stopped, and Gabriel scrupled to desert him, 
although it meant they, too, were deserting their posts. Mary hadn&#39;t 
gone anywhere in the last twelve hours, and showed no signs of leaving 
her own perch under Lipton&#39;s apartment. Recalling her reaction to her 
son&#39;s questions, he chuckled inwardly and realized she was there waiting 
devotedly for the detective. Even now, she might be with him, admiring 
him in what Gabriel presumed was her demure manner. He really didn&#39;t 
know from experience what Mary&#39;s heart was like, but he knew a crush 
when he saw one, and thought they would probably be in this strange and 
futile courtship.

Or at least he hoped so. These thoughts calmed him, but they did not 
pacify him. He followed Michael in a silent state of turmoil, knowing 
he&#39;d never forgive either of them if the detective were harmed.

It was in this way that they failed to observe Lipton and Mary&#39;s 
departure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

It did not go wholly unnoticed, however.

Resolved, Alphonse Lorenzo watched as Lipton exited his building, 
conversed with that rather striking young homeless girl, and then 
departed with her. He trailed them at a distance with such stealth as 
would have made his friend proud, had he not been the object of it. His 
particular attention was given, however, to his friend&#39;s companion. At 
first glance, sitting in the alley as she was, she&#39;d looked like she was 
dressed in rags, but Lorenzo soon realized that this must have been a 
trick of the light, because her leather trench coat was unscathed, and 
of expensive make.

He observed her for some blocks, enjoying the way the sunlight hit her, 
which gave her the illusion of having a bright halo. Lost in his 
reflections, he changed his opinion quickly; not a halo, a crown. 
Certainly a crown, as her regal and self-assured walk suggested. The sun 
never seemed to leave her, either, so he was left with this pleasant 
thought even in the darkness of the subway, as he covertly joined them 
on the train to Greenwich Village.

The girl had such an ethereal quality to her that Lorenzo was unable to 
place her age; she could have been sixteen or sixty, but her face, or 
what few glimpses he caught of it, was pure beauty. His thoughts fleeted 
for a moment to the ammo Lipton had let him handle the previous evening, 
and for just a moment, he wondered if this was his holy friend that he 
thought was Mary. If it was, Lorenzo decided, he could see why Lipton 
believed this, as the girl was grace itself in every sense of the word.

Soon, he began to just gaze at her, and his mind wandered to much more 
intimate thoughts. He tried to imagine ministering to her, which drifted 
him into pleasant reflections of what the velvet of her touch must feel 
like, what rapture the soft glide of her caress must be. Before he knew 
it, his mind had fixed on the taste of her lips, the scent of her 
perfume, her figure pressed against him as he held her in his arms...

Starting, he crossed himself. Lipton&#39;s demonic mistress must be 
infecting my mind!

This caused him a brief glance of suspicion directed at Lipton&#39;s 
companion, but very brief. She was above and beyond such reproach. 
Lorenzo didn&#39;t know why he knew this, and that made him uneasy, but she 
was the most pious woman he had ever set eyes upon. He was ashamed of 
his lustful thoughts, especially of fixing them on a creature so 
perfect, so... holy.

He spent the rest of the ride in silent prayer, dutifully saying his 
rosary, feeling all the more miserable because he could not even get her 
image out of his head long enough to pray for forgiveness for his own 
lust of her.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;The time has come!&quot;

Bhaalor raised his club to the garrison of demons on the field before 
him.

Today, no mines, no explosions wracked it. Today, from the front stairs 
of his castle, the Warlord of Hell addressed his troops, all in the 
orderly ranks they kept, and prepared them for war.

&quot;Seraph Darkfell is going to die, and she will die today!&quot;

The demons cheered, growled, sneered; they were beginning to taste the 
blood that was soon coming.

&quot;We&#39;ll tear off her arms and legs, and feast on them tonight!&quot;

Another cry of agreement issued from the crowd.

&quot;We&#39;ll shit on her bones!&quot;

His minions liked this idea, too.

&quot;Are you ready to kill?&quot;

The crowd was enthusiastic in its confirmation.

&quot;ARE YOU READY TO KILL?&quot; Bhaalor demanded again, his voice echoing all 
over the battlefield.

&quot;YEAH!&quot; the crowd roared back.

Bhaalor then turned his attention to the surface world, and waited for 
Temporiel&#39;s signal.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Observing this spectacle from afar, Faust and Aphrodite could only shake 
their heads.

&quot;Poor Seraph,&quot; Aphrodite said sadly.

&quot;Bhaalor&#39;s as witty and eloquent as ever,&quot; Faust observed bitingly.

&quot;I wish there was something we could do,&quot;

Faust glanced at her for a moment, his mind struggling with an abhorrent 
decision. But his conscience actually got the best of him, and he placed 
a hesitant arm around Aphrodite.

&quot;Seraph is no mere trifle,&quot; he said by way of comfort. &quot;She&#39;s gracefully 
evaded every obstacle in her path. She&#39;ll be quite all right... I hope.&quot;

&quot;Why Faust, I do believe you care!&quot; Aphrodite teased, snuggling closer 
to him despite his flinching.

&quot;Well, I must urge secrecy,&quot; was the reply. &quot;If everyone found out, it 
could cause more uproar in this place than our errant friend&#39;s new 
romance.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, relaxing became too much for even Heart and Seraph, and they 
got dressed and sat out on the balcony to play backgammon. They chatted 
happily some more about life on the Surface, and Seraph tried to tell 
Heart as much as she could about how humans structured their world.

Finally, after muttering something to herself, Heart asked, &quot;And what do 
cops do?&quot;

Seraph wrinkled her brow. &quot;Cops are policeman, dear.&quot;

&quot;Oh! Law-enforcers,&quot; Heart said.

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s homicide?&quot;

Seraph narrowed her eyes. &quot;Those are the guys that investigate murders,&quot; 
she explained. &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Murders!&quot; Heart exclaimed, aghast. &quot;Well, then why would that &#39;homicide 
cop&#39; want to talk to you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Seraph said, puzzled. &quot;I haven&#39;t killed any humans. And 
you know everyone I have killed.&quot;

&quot;Do you think he would be asking about the death of demons?&quot; Heart 
asked. &quot;I don&#39;t know how much sense that makes...&quot;

&quot;Why are you wondering about all this?&quot; Seraph queried, conjecturing 
suddenly what Heart had been muttering about.

&quot;Well, that &#39;homicide cop&#39; is here, in the building,&quot; Heart said, 
staring off into space. Concentrating really hard, she added, &quot;But he&#39;s 
on the floor below ours.&quot;

Seraph&#39;s eyes widened.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna kill Thor,&quot; she growled.

&quot;If Thor gave him the address, dear, he&#39;d already be here,&quot; Heart 
pointed out. &quot;He just knows it&#39;s somewhere in the building. Oh! He&#39;s on 
his way up.&quot;

&quot;Is he alone? Or are there other cops with him?&quot; Seraph asked fearfully.

&quot;He&#39;s not alone, but I don&#39;t think the other lady&#39;s a cop,&quot; Heart said. 
&quot;In fact, she looks familiar, but I can&#39;t quite place her&#151;&quot;

She broke off and went to the door, opening it to a stunned detective. 
His fist was poised to knock, and the expression on his face was one of 
sheepish embarrassment mixed with recognition and resolve. It was 
quickly replaced with a look of horror, and he suddenly pushed Heart 
aside to charge into the room with his weapon drawn.

Heart turned in shock, watching his partner follow him, but a moment 
revealed the source of Lipton&#39;s alarm.

Angels. A host of them, led by Cherubiel, headed straight for the 
balcony, their chariots drawn by Pegasi so fierce their breath steamed.

&quot;Seraph!&quot; she screamed. &quot;Get off the balcony!&quot;

The stranger grabbed the detective.

&quot;No, Bruce!&quot; she cried. &quot;It&#39;s too dangerous!&quot;

Seraph charged toward them, weapon in hand, and stood beside Heart. She 
noted with interest that the detective made no move for her; his eyes 
and gun were trained at the incoming host.

Heart had her sword ready, but she looked at the detective.

&quot;Excuse me, Mr. Bruce?&quot; she asked.

&quot;It&#39;s Lipton, Bruce Lipton,&quot; he corrected. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Bruce, look!&quot; Before he could answer, Mary grabbed his arm and pointed 
out to Cherubiel and his squadron. The gargoyles were shaking away their 
slumber and setting to flight as the horsemen approached. The first one 
fully awake rent the air with such an awful cry that even the 
supernatural beings in the room covered their ears. They all took up the 
cry, leaping toward the Charioteers, who tried to beat them back with 
their whips. Soon Angels and gargoyles were in an all-out dogfight, 
crisscrossing through the air with the sounds of thunder and piercing 
wails. The occupants of the apartment looked at one another, stunned.

&quot;There&#39;s something rotten in the state of Denmark,&quot; Heart scowled, her 
mind at alert.

&quot;Be ready for anything,&quot; Seraph added.

As Lipton nodded in silent agreement, the whole building began to shake. 
The entire room was a bounce-house of twitching, shaking, rumbling, as 
though an earthquake had begun in the floor beneath their feet. A sound 
like a freight train echoed through the apartment.

&quot;My God, what is that smell!&quot; cried a voice behind them.

They all turned to look at the doorway, where another human man stood. 
Short and stocky, with a thick, close-cut mane of almost-black hair 
covering his head and in a goatee around his chin, he was dressed in the 
livery of a priest. His round face was kindly, but his stern eyes meant 
business as they focused on Seraph.

&quot;It is the stench of Hell!&quot; he added, pointing at Seraph. &quot;And you, 
demon, have brought it!&quot;

He took a step into the room, and began to feel the pitch and roll of 
the ethereal earthquake. This did not lessen his determination. Lipton, 
however, matched it by making his way so that finally, he stood before 
the succubus and blocked the priest&#39;s line of sight.

&quot;Lorenzo, you&#151;&quot; he began to shout, but was cut off by a loud, shrill 
whistle, like a pot of tea finished steeping. Their attention was now 
collectively drawn to the center of the room, where a hole began to 
open, pouring fourth steam, and various imps, demons, and devils, as 
though a volcano had erupted. They began to attack, howling a battlecry 
as they swept in.

Heart and Seraph started swinging at them wildly with their weapons, but 
Lipton was having trouble shooting them, keeping up with their speed. He 
wished like hell he&#39;d brought more and other weapons with him... when 
suddenly his mind was brought to a weighty item in his inside pocket. He 
grabbed it as the little bastards began to gnaw at his ankles and 
calves, the bolder ones scaling his trench coat and biting for his arms 
and neck. Hilt in his hand, he started peeling them off and hurling them 
back down the hole from whence they came, and then he leaped onto the 
kitchen counter. Finally clear of them, he held out his new toy, 
acquired only two nights before in another battle.

&quot;Hasen!&quot; he cried, and the flame blade sprang from the sword, merrily 
flickering with a holy light that seemed to drive the lesser demons and 
devils away.

Mary had sauntered very gracefully over to Lorenzo and stood at his 
shoulder. Before the demon-volcano erupted, she had had a chance to hiss 
in his ear, &quot;What you smell is shit. Shit and brimstone.&quot;

To Lorenzo, she might as well have been singing the &quot;Halleluiah Chorus,&quot; 
for all of the melody her tone created in his ears. He had remained 
stunned for a moment by her voice. As the wave of demons flooded from 
the unnatural hole that had formed in the floor, he stood there, 
petrified, shocked that he could be witnessing this. He believed in 
demons, and knew much about them through his dealings with Lipton, but 
he had always believed them to be figurative. He never expected to be 
confronted with such a vivid proof of their existence. As he fumbled for 
his holy water, kicking at them as they approached, he kept an eye on 
Lipton, and saw him invoke the sword.

As soon as Lorenzo realized what Lipton had, his entire body went numb, 
and he began to have the sensation of floating. His vision and hearing 
were fine, but they seemed to be happening to someone else, with him as 
a mute observer. With sudden sureness, he found his vial of holy water, 
and opened it, glad of the generous amount he had brought. He noticed 
the smaller demons didn&#39;t come too close to him, and so he began to 
advance. They backed further and further away, frustrated anger on their 
faces. When he finally came to the head of the group, positioned between 
his allies and the demons, he raised his arm and splattered a line of 
holy water across the floor.

Lipton was impressed as a shining blue line of holy energy etched itself 
into the floor, the light driving the demons further back. Deep 
admiration coursed through him as he realized his old friend was a more 
powerful ally that he&#39;d originally thought. He jumped back off the 
counter, heading for the edge of the line as Lorenzo repeated the action 
on the opposite direction.

&quot;Hey!&quot; Seraph cried, backing away from the line herself. He&#39;d almost hit 
her with the splatter the second time. &quot;Watch where you throw that 
crap!&quot;

Lorenzo began to advance upon her.

&quot;Ye spawn of Satan,&quot; he cried, trying his best to sound like Peter 
Cushing. He poised his arm to splash her with the lethal fluid in his 
vial. &quot;I will send you back to the Hell that created you!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Heart cried, jumping in front of Seraph and taking the hit 
herself. It absorbed into her skin and caused her halo to glow so 
brightly, Seraph had to back away and the humans covered their eyes.

&quot;Ooh! Holy water!&quot; she squealed with delight.

&quot;Hey, priest!&quot; Mary approached him. &quot;Let me have a hit of that!&quot;

Lorenzo frowned at her verbiage, but splashed her nonetheless. How could 
he deny the one true angel in the room?

&quot;There, demon,&quot; he glared at Seraph, who had to back even further away 
from the two angels. &quot;Cower from the light of God&#151;&quot;

He was cut off by the look of terror that crossed the faces of everyone 
in the room, Lipton&#39;s being the most grotesque mask of all. He had never 
seen his friend so frightened, so afraid... but the heavy hand on his 
shoulder and the deep growl behind him paralyzed him again with fear. He 
didn&#39;t even look behind him, although as he was picked up and thrown 
through the air he caught a glimpse of a massive chest and deadly twin 
spikes rising from a nearly neckless head. Then things went black for a 
few minutes.

&quot;Bhaalor,&quot; Seraph growled, her fear turned to anger, &quot;What an honor.&quot; 
Violet fire flared around her trident.

Finding his voice, Lipton said, &quot;The Demon Lord of No Neck.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t piss him off,&quot; Mary whispered. &quot;This is not a nice guy.&quot;

Bhaalor only smirked at him and turned his attention back to Seraph. He 
didn&#39;t waste any time as he swept down his great morningstar, slamming 
it into the floor as Seraph nimbly leapt back. The line of holy water 
dimmed in the sight of such evil, and he passed right through it and 
pursued her.

Before anyone had a chance to move, five more demons sprung from the 
hole. Licking their chops, they each picked a target without regard for 
who was around. Lipton recalled the recognition the demons had had in 
his first encounter with Mary, and also noticed the clothes these demons 
were wearing.

They had to be elite. There was no question. One wore an SS uniform, and 
a couple of them had various ornaments collected from past victims 
displayed on their attire. There was even a redcoat, making Lipton&#39;s 
Longfellow echo through the recesses his mind. The redcoat went after 
Mary, licking his lips in gleeful anticipation, showing he knew full 
well who he was advancing upon.

Two of them faced off with him. They were both dressed in the armor of 
some Renaissance culture, but they also had slings of ammo around their 
torsos, and really big guns.

Lipton looked at those guns and thought, Oh shit. Then he leaped over 
the counter, wishing the sword&#39;s blade would retreat. To his surprise, 
it did, and he dropped it when he&#39;d reached cover, grabbing the pistol 
Mary had given him. He was not ignorant that a trail of bullets had 
followed him the entire way, one even nicking his coat.

Mary, with a flap of her wings, heaved herself in the air, then showered 
a rain of gunfire on all three of the demons that had advanced on her 
and Lipton. They were all too willing to fire back, though, and she 
found herself crouching in the chandelier, taking cover once again.

Heart stole a glance around as the remaining two demons advanced on her. 
One, who was dressed in black fatigues and a turban, had a machete and a 
sawed-off shotgun. The other was the SS officer, who looked quite at 
home with his Luger. Heart could see the taint of damnation and sickly 
bruise-like aura that floated around the guns, and decided to follow 
Mary. For cover, she blew a burst of holy light right in their faces, 
which burned them a little and dazzled their eyes just long enough to 
fly up to the chandelier.

&quot;This won&#39;t hold both of us, sweetie,&quot; Mary cautioned between rounds.

Heart considered this as she dodged the too-close shots of all five 
demons. She looked down at the detective, the poor human all alone 
behind the counter, and said to Mary, &quot;Cover me, please?&quot;

Mary frowned and nodded, switching to a semi-automatic and drawing their 
fire with her own. She watched, though, with admiration as Heart bravely 
flew straight for Lipton, ducking with him behind the counter while the 
shooters were aiming for the chandelier.

Heart looked at the detective, who was bewildered at the sudden company.

&quot;You&#39;re here to help us, right?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Kind of.&quot; Lipton leaned over the counter to take a few shots, then 
ducked again. The demons had regrouped, and had overturned furniture to 
use as cover. He wondered what the couple thought of the mess their new 
home was becoming.

&quot;Seraph thinks you&#39;re here to hurt her,&quot; Heart observed, starting to 
draw shapes on the floor. They blazed with a pale blue light which 
extended itself from the rest of her aura, and Lipton allowed his mind 
to briefly wonder what kind of spell she was casting.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;Homicide. You are a homicide cop, right?&quot;

&quot;Who did she kill?&quot; Lipton replied dismissively.

&quot;Well, demons and those angels the other night&#151;&quot;

&quot;Demons? No such thing,&quot; Lipton said, but he winked. As he leaned up and 
started firing again, he continued, &quot;Officially, all the demons I know 
your girlfriend killed were mob hits. Seraph&#39;s not connected with the 
mob, is she?&quot;

Heart thought of Tony, and said, &quot;Well&#151;&quot;

&quot;Okay, I know about Tony Scorciano, but his family is harmless. Their 
button-men are all old farts, and most of their business is laundering, 
like Tony does.&quot; He gave her a pointed glance as he ducked back down.

&quot;What does that have to do with killing people?&quot;

&quot;Nothing, and technically neither do you guys.&quot; He offered her a wry 
grin.

&quot;Then why are you here?&quot; Heart had finished her drawing, but she waited 
patiently for an answer.

&quot;Well, if you hadn&#39;t noticed, I&#39;m not exactly clueless as to what you 
are,&quot; he explained, raising an eyebrow at her. &quot;And you wouldn&#39;t believe 
what&#39;s happened to me ever since you got here. If you had any idea what 
I&#39;ve been through, you&#39;d understand.&quot;

&quot;Tell me,&quot; the angel prodded.

He looked at her incredulously, weapon reloaded and ready for the next 
futile attempt.

&quot;Um... later,&quot; he said. &quot;Just do your thing, so I can do my thing.&quot;

He leaned over the counter again, but he heard Heart&#39;s voice chanting 
behind him in a language that was so symphonic, so beautiful, that it 
brought tears to his eyes. It was almost as though she were singing, and 
that song touched his heart, pulling at it with an overwhelming love. 
Her words were no less beautiful, and the icing on the cake for him was 
that he could understand them.

&quot;O essence of Love that is in me/grant my love the potency/to spread 
through the vicinity/and protect those who are helping me. &quot;

Heart sat in the center of her glowing glyph, and her aura did seem to 
expand, a soft blue mist that spread around the room. The more it 
expanded, the louder the screeching from the minor minions was, and 
there was an audible sizzle as the holy power became too much for them. 
Several of them disappeared to ash on the floor. The survivors jumped 
down the hole to escape the poisonous air.

The higher minions, though, weren&#39;t affected by it at all. The worst it 
did for them, and for Bhaalor, was diminish their field of vision. For a 
few moments, gunshots stopped, from both blinded sides. All that could 
be heard were the cries of gargoyles and the beating of hooves from 
outside.

Seraph, after dodging Bhaalor&#39;s first blow, had found herself dodging a 
flurry of them, and the detective&#39;s blessed ammo hadn&#39;t made her life 
easier. She had tried to go for the spare bedroom, but it was blocked by 
the other demons, and when they had finally retreated into it, she&#39;d 
realized it was off-limits. She couldn&#39;t dodge Bhaalor&#39;s blows forever, 
but the others seemed to be at a stand-off with his minions, and Seraph 
had known she was on her own. The priest was still out cold, and she had 
been surprised at herself by being disappointed by that. He would have 
come in handy...

She had tried to stay away from the cross-fire, but Bhaalor seemed 
determined to work her toward it. Then, suddenly, a fog as thick as 
smoke rolled through the room, comprised entirely of what felt like... 
Heart. It was as though the angel had turned herself into this thick 
mist, and was using it to envelope Seraph. She couldn&#39;t see a thing, 
but, more importantly, neither could Bhaalor.

She knew the counter was to her left, and she immediately hurled herself 
in that direction as she heard the grunts of surprise and frustration 
from Bhaalor and his lieutenants. Gliding in, she misjudged the distance 
and bounced off the far wall, crashing into Heart.

The mist abruptly fell.

As Seraph rose to her knees, Lipton turned and offered her a hand.

&quot;Seraph Darkfell, I presume,&quot; he said. She took his hand and shook it.

&quot;But of course,&quot; she replied wryly. She chanced a peek over the counter, 
then ducked quickly as several bullets turned the toaster oven next to 
her into scrap.

&quot;Do you still have that happy little toy of yours?&quot; she asked him. 
Lipton nodded, brow wrinkled in confusion. &quot;Good. We&#39;re all going to 
rush him.&quot;

There was no time for questions or complaints. All three of them rose 
and ran around the counter, the blade of Lipton&#39;s sword burning angrily 
at the sight of so much unholiness. Lipton took his left, Seraph his 
right, and Heart found herself at his back. She immediately gave up her 
position as a hail of bullets came flying toward her. All of them hit 
Bhaalor squarely in the back, but bounced off with a prolonged and 
sickening thud. Heart found herself on the floor next to the priest. She 
put a hand on his head.

&quot;Holy light within this soul/Shine ye bright and make him whole.&quot;

As the priest began to stir, she jumped back behind the counter and cast 
another spell.

&quot;With my love that never ends/protect my lover and my friend.&quot;

A pale blue aura surrounded Seraph and Lipton, all of whose blows were 
being effectively blocked by Bhaalor&#39;s club. However, the aura seemed to 
lend both of them, especially Seraph, a bit of strength as well, and 
suddenly Bhaalor was overmatched. Caught between Seraph and Lipton, he 
could only continue to parry and dodge.

Heart looked at this in satisfaction, then looked at the demons who&#39;d 
taken cover in the spare bedroom. Mary was firing semi-automatic rounds 
at them still, and all they could do was fire wildly back &#151; at her, at 
their boss and his tormentors, and everywhere around the room. She 
crawled behind the counter and into the bedroom, watching as Cherubiel&#39;s 
minions fought the gargoyles. Neither side seemed to be able to secure 
the upper hand, which was both a distress and a relief to her. There was 
nothing she could do to either empower the gargoyles or weaken the 
Charioteers. She sat by, feeling helpless for a moment, trying to think 
of a spell to help, when an idea struck her.

Jumping up, she ran to the side of the balcony and looked up at the sky. 
Except in the very early morning, it had been overcast. Seraph had said 
it might snow. Snow had a nasty effect on feathers...

Thor is real, which means there are others who are real...

&quot;Gods of rain, gods of snow/unleash your arctic storm below!&quot;

The effect could not have been greater. The dark sky darkened, and the 
wind rose to a howling crescendo. The Charioteers began to have trouble 
keeping their glide-paths, as the ever-shifting gale had no clear 
current. Worse for them was the snow and ice that collected in their 
wings and the wings of their steeds, which burdened them down and made 
them slower. None of this affected the sturdier gargoyles, whose stone 
bodies could cut more effectively through the wind, with snow rolling 
off their backs.

Heart laughed with joy as the Charioteers were forced to retreat. She 
waved at the gargoyles as they flooded the apartment and flew straight 
into the spare bedroom. Her glee diminished, however, with Cherubiel&#39;s 
departing glare.

Meanwhile, Lorenzo was battling his fear, ill-aimed bullets, and the 
freezing wind, which had blown open both balcony doors. Moments later, 
when he&#39;d finally somewhat composed himself, a huge cloud of black came 
billowing through the door and into the next room.

What most occupied his attention, however, was the behemoth that was 
fighting Lipton and the succubus. He&#39;d come here to do an exorcism; here 
was the perfect candidate. He began to realize that if he timed things 
just right, he might be able to ensnare them both, sending them back to 
Hell where they belonged. Giddily, he began the rites. As he hit the 
giant demon with the holy water, it steamed, and Bhaalor howled in pain.

Swinging wildly in blinding agony, the massive demon caught Lipton full 
in the stomach. The detective, winded but amazingly still conscious, 
found himself flying through the air. He crashed into the wall, 
imprinting it with his body, and slumped to the floor, momentarily 
dazed. After a few moments, he shook his head to see a blurry but very 
bright angel kneeling before him.

&quot;No,&quot; he moaned, free-associating. &quot;I&#39;m not ready to go.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not time yet,&quot; a familiar voice pierced the gloom.

&quot;Mary!&quot; he exclaimed, still in a stupor. &quot;I love Mary.&quot;

The Virgin Mother started, her eyes widening for a moment. He loves me? 
she wondered. No... he can&#39;t... She shook her head, trying to reason 
that he&#39;d meant something else, something more platonic and far less... 
tempting. She set to work on rousing him before he said anything else.

Lorenzo had heard the exchange as well. Never at any moment had he ever 
thought himself capable of the emotions running through his mind. 
Despair, anger, jealousy, hatred, all coursed through his veins. He 
couldn&#39;t understand it, couldn&#39;t like it, but he was unable to let it 
go. He glared at the dueling demons. It had to be their influence. He 
read faster.

Seraph was matching Bhaalor thrust for parry, but she was unable to 
equal him in strength. She found herself losing ground to him until the 
thin sheen of snow that had piled on the balcony was beneath her feet. 
She couldn&#39;t duck around him; he&#39;d swing his club in a wide arc and 
force her back further. The air around her crackled with pale blue 
energy, contrasted by the cold glow of the fire from her trident.

As Bhaalor stepped out into the open air, the snow beneath him sizzled 
with the sudden hellish heat. Small wisps of steam floated from various 
parts of his skin the moment the snowflakes touched it. Outside, the 
wind blew away the foul and sickening stench of Bhaalor and his demons, 
but in turn blew snow across their fields of vision. Seraph very soon 
found herself at a major disadvantage as the surface of the balcony was 
slick with a sheen of ice. The footwork she had to do to continue 
eluding his crushing blows had doubled in difficulty, and keeping her 
balance was now the more urgent priority.

Heart watched this with dismay, and realized that she&#39;d had enough of 
snow. She looked up, wondering if she had the strength within her to 
counter her original spell. What could she possibly cast to make the 
storm go away? She fumbled for the words to make it happen.

&quot;Winds of passion, winds of change,&quot; she began, then faltered, her mind 
a tornado of chaos. &quot;Leave, go away, disperse... this, this... This 
squall, storm, gale!&quot;

As they always did when she evoked a spell, her words echoed through the 
wind, but the storm just shook more snow on them as though spicing them 
up for a meal. Desperate, Heart stole a glance at Seraph, anguishing 
that she couldn&#39;t think straight. It was cold, she felt as though 
someone had lumped a great stone on her back, and Seraph was having more 
and more trouble with the ice.

All the frustration at seeing her lover thus encumbered finally strained 
Heart&#39;s patience, and she cried out, &quot;Stop the snow!&quot;

Suddenly, and as though with great purpose, the snow stopped falling. A 
thin ray of sunlight pierced the sky, and seemed to push the clouds 
aside. The clouds looked as though they were reluctant to leave, yet 
scared to argue; they swirled about threateningly for just a moment 
before being cast off toward Connecticut on a steady and swift wind. It 
was still cold, and there was still snow on the ground, but the white 
city was now bathed in sunlight that made it sparkle like a jewel set on 
the green cloth of the river. Heart&#39;s breath caught in her throat.

Right at that moment, though, Seraph let out a yell. Heart didn&#39;t have 
time to wonder why the storm had suddenly decided to listen. She looked 
over just in time to see the succubus completely lose her footing on the 
ice. Seraph folded forward in an attempt to catch her footing, but left 
herself completely undefended. Bhaalor took the opportunity afforded him 
and swung for some point halfway across the city, Babe Ruth reborn. 
Seraph&#39;s limp form sparked more brightly as her body left the business 
end of the club, then dimmed out altogether as she was thrown over the 
balcony and off into the distance.

Heart jumped up and, on reflex, leaped off the balcony to save her 
lover. She was gliding through midair over lower Manhattan, nearly 
reaching the end of the Village before it occurred to her to be afraid. 
She was free-floating through the air, keeping a surprisingly steady 
altitude, gliding like a rocket. Washington Square Park went beneath her 
in a green blur, and moments later, Union Square was another spot of 
green among the grey. As the Empire State Building loomed closer and 
closer, her fear grew greater and greater, but so did her awe.

She was flying. Somehow, she was airborne, and staying that way. She 
wasn&#39;t sure what was keeping her aloft, until she felt the tingling pain 
in her back. And then her joy was overwhelming. All of the hope that had 
left her feeling empty and desperate now flooded back in a bright, warm 
ray of light. She could face the entire Heavenly Host, could back down 
Bhaalor in a heartbeat.

Her wings were back, as though they&#39;d never been gone.

She hadn&#39;t been able to feel her wings before because somehow, they&#39;d 
been numbed. The sudden activity was now arousing them from their 
slumber, and feeling rushed into them in tiny daggers of circulation. 
She didn&#39;t dare move them, but she could even feel her feathers brushing 
against her back, a sensation she thought she&#39;d never feel again. She 
wanted to fly up into the clouds, and let the whole world hear her 
elation, feel the swelling in her heart as she flew close to the bright 
sun.

For now though, that was impossible. Heart&#39;s wings had captured the 
updraft provided by the stormy wind, as well as the city below. Seraph 
was the priority, and she was ever closer. Heart risked one last glance 
at the Empire State Building, then formed an idea based from a movie 
she&#39;d caught back when they were living in the hotel. In that one, a 
giant ape had climbed the building, and, gripping the antenna on top, 
had fought off fighter pilots that were shooting at him. It wasn&#39;t till 
he let go of the antenna that he&#39;d fallen.

She had to stop Seraph&#39;s unwanted voyage, but needed her wings to wake 
up to make the stop herself. There was no time for chants or magick, 
there was only her, Seraph, the building and the wind. With a mighty 
effort, she flexed her wings, the circulation exploding all over her 
back in sparks of newly-roused nerves. She was rewarded by just enough 
of an increase in speed to allow her to grab Seraph, embracing her 
tightly in one arm as she desperately grabbed for the antenna with the 
other. Gripping it despite the resistance of their momentum, she cried 
out from exertion. The force was almost crushing as it wracked through 
both her and Seraph&#39;s bodies, waving them like flags atop the landmark.

Then, finally, they were released, and dropped down to rest on the 
building&#39;s roof.

Heart pulled Seraph up, allowing the dazed succubus to grab the antenna. 
They worked themselves up, supporting themselves from it as though it 
were a walking stick. Seraph shook her head, trying to clear the dimness 
that had taken over when the full force of Bhaalor&#39;s blow caught up with 
her. There were deep cuts in her abdomen that were bleeding profusely 
down the front of her skirt, and she was having trouble standing all the 
way up. Heart muttered to herself in angelic and touched the area 
lightly, infusing it with her pale blue aura.

Gulping for breath, Seraph asked, &quot;How am I still alive?&quot;

&quot;The shield I put up around you absorbed Bhaalor&#39;s blow,&quot; Heart replied, 
trying to check the succubus&#39;s wounds. &quot;Are you hurt anywhere else?&quot;

&quot;No, I just need to catch my breath,&quot; Seraph heaved.

She promptly lost her breath again, as well as her footing, when she 
looked around to see the entire city stretched out before her from its 
highest point. If she squinted, she could barely make out home, which 
was exploding with blue flashes.

&quot;How the hell did we get up here?&quot; she asked, looking at Heart in 
wonder. Her eyes widened when Heart flexed her wings, which were finally 
back to full capacity. &quot;Your wings! But... how?&quot;

&quot;I think maybe the Virgin Queen gave them back to me,&quot; Heart breathed.

&quot;Yeah, I was wondering what she was doing there,&quot; Seraph replied, her 
voice laced with suspicion. &quot;But she wasn&#39;t trying to kill me, so she 
demanded secondary attention.&quot;

&quot;Well, we have to get back,&quot; Heart told her, taking a shaky glance back 
toward their apartment. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll survive,&quot; Seraph replied, rising to her full stature. Her abdomen 
still ached with a dull flame, and each breath was fire in her lungs, 
but she flexed her own wings. &quot;If you give me a push, anyway.&quot;

Heart smiled, and took Seraph&#39;s hand. They looked at one another, their 
eyes full of mutual admiration, their love flooding between them in an 
almost-visible current. Then they both jumped, feet-first, from the 
building. Down, down they sailed, Heart beginning to panic for a moment, 
still unsure of her wings. They&#39;d caught the air, but she hesitated for 
just a moment.

Then, flexing muscles that had grown a bit weak from disuse, she managed 
to heave her wings several times, carrying them both up over the city, 
over the wind and weather. They were so high, they could see the outline 
of the island to their east and the rolling suburbs to their west. From 
this height, Heart began a deep, spiraling descent, an arrow fired 
straight for the top floor of their building. She had to point her wings 
to steady them when they hit the wind again, but it served to slow them, 
the wind rushing across their faces, plastering their lips into smiles. 
Their landing was controlled, Heart passing the balcony and hooking up 
to alight them upon it like butterflies.

Seraph had her weapon at the ready, but glanced around for her 
adversary. Puzzled, she wondered aloud, &quot;Where&#39;s Bhaalor?&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Bhaalor had had little time to enjoy his victory over Seraph. Moments 
later, he could feel all his muscles stiffen, his body dragging back 
toward the portal that led to the Highway. He struggled to turn, only to 
see the priest through the haze of smoke and debris.

The young human had a cross in his hand, held aloft as though it were 
Excalibur, and his other hand was busy with the decanter of holy water, 
splashing it on the Lord of War liberally. He hadn&#39;t been paying 
attention to the puny little man, and thus allowed the cleric to get 
most of the way through the Rites of Exorcism. Bhaalor could feel the 
pull, as though the hole were a great vacuum trying to suck him back 
down to Hell. He cried out, the sounds of his agony echoing over the 
gunfire and explosions from the bedroom. He tried to swing at the priest 
before he could finish, tried to distract him or somehow just stop him.

&quot;In nomine Padre!&quot; Lorenzo cried out, splashing the huge crimson-skinned 
beast with the decanter.

&quot;Fili!&quot; He splashed the fiend again.

&quot;Et Spiritu Sancti!&quot;

With this last and final blow, Bhaalor&#39;s skin was ablaze with pain and 
holy light, the gravity becoming more powerful than he could handle. His 
yell reached a crescendo as the force seemed to rip through his back, 
into his abdomen, and yank him down, pulling harder and harder until he 
crashed all the way back into Hell.

Lorenzo took a deep breath and wiped his sweaty brow, secretly awed by 
the effect he had created. Then he turned as another explosion of stone 
and debris blasted out of the bedroom, blowing him down on the seat of 
his pants. Everything seemed to move in slow motion as he watched the 
last of the gargoyles chase the wounded and dismembered demons out of 
the bedroom, and toward the hole. Breathing hard and fumbling through 
his bag, his hand wrapped in dismay around the grip of his pistol. He 
pulled it out and wildly pulled the trigger, aiming toward the hole, 
toward the demons as they ran by the balcony door.

The shot echoed throughout the whole apartment, stopping everything as 
Seraph halted her charge into the room. One of the demon-minions slammed 
into her as he made for the hole, knocking her over and landing on top 
of her. One of the gargoyles grabbed him and, with all the power of its 
stone claws, quartered the demon by its limbs. A shower of black blood 
exploded over Seraph before the pieces were hurled down the hole near 
her head. She rose, and looked over at Heart, crying out in pain and 
panic.

Lorenzo, Lipton and Mary watched in grief as the bullet hit the angel 
square in the chest. The impact knocked her full off her feet, and she 
landed flat on her back, the dull sound echoing through the apartment 
and stunning everyone to silence. Lipton glared at Lorenzo as the priest 
pushed himself to his feet. The former walked over to his friend, 
smacking him with an upward sweep across the back of the head, like he&#39;d 
seen Al&#39;s mother do.

&quot;What the hell are you doing!&quot; the detective exclaimed. &quot;Do you know 
what you just did?&quot;

Lorenzo stood there, frozen, stunned, staring at the havoc he&#39;d wrought. 
His whole body felt numb, but his mind was blazing with pain, the scene 
before him branding itself into his moral code, his very judgment of 
himself.

Seraph had scrambled to her lover, and was now cradling the angel in her 
arms, rocking back and forth, softly calling her name. Everything had 
gone dull; all color had removed itself from the room. A huge angry lump 
was forming in her throat and she had to fight it to softly call Heart&#39;s 
name. Tears stung her eyes and crumbled her whole face with anguish.

A bladed boot-heel to her side prompted her to look into Mary&#39;s face, 
the golden halo searing her eyes and reddening her skin.

&quot;You can kill me now,&quot; she said, tears streaming down her face. &quot;She&#39;s 
dead; I want to be, too.&quot;

Mary was taken aback, both by the demon&#39;s words, and by the visible 
torment that she displayed. Curiously, she reached down, using a finger 
to wipe a stain of tears from Seraph&#39;s face, then licking them from her 
finger.

&quot;Tears? From a demon?&quot; she said aloud, confused. She looked at Lipton, 
knowing, and fearing, the truth.

&quot;I told you,&quot; Lipton smirked. From beside him, however, Lorenzo fumed.

&quot;If you won&#39;t do it,&quot; he announced, striding purposely forward with his 
satchel on his shoulder. &quot;Then I will.&quot;

Mary&#39;s face contorted with sudden indignation. She rose a finger and 
pointed at the priest, surrounded suddenly by a bright golden light. Her 
trench-coat seemed to blend into itself as her halo shaped itself into a 
bright golden crown; unadorned but delicately-wrought. Her dark grey 
wings spread out, covering the demon and the angel, blocking them from 
Lorenzo&#39;s line of sight.

The aura permeated the room, bringing with it a terrible yet 
comfortable, almost safe, feeling. There was eternal love welling from 
her golden light, but also an even hand of force that would brook no 
misbehavior. There was the joy of angels, and the sorrow of a mother 
grieved, thickening in the room as her holy light grew more and more 
intense.

&quot;Alphonse Lorenzo,&quot; she intoned, her voice echoing with power. &quot;You have 
been a pest.&quot;

Before he even had time to be anguished by the weight of her ire, Father 
Alphonse Lorenzo disappeared in a flash of exploding golden motes. 
Lipton hopped up, looking at Mary, his hand on his gun.

Mary laughed, harmony itself. &quot;Would you take me on, Detective? Would 
you really try to hurt me?&quot;

Lipton holstered his gun.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t stand a chance,&quot; he conceded. &quot;But for the record, the 
artists definitely got it wrong.&quot;

The bright and gentle smile Mary proffered him proved him wrong. He 
stared at his feet, scowling, feeling his face get hot.

&quot;Your friend is safe,&quot; she told him. &quot;He&#39;s just not... here.&quot;

Purposefully, finished with Lipton for the moment, she turned her full 
attention to the succubus and the wounded angel. She could see Heart&#39;s 
aura glowing dimly, almost imperceptibly, and knew her time was running 
out. She leaned down, and pressed Seraph&#39;s hand onto the wound.

Seraph was in awe. She had always presumed that Mary could incinerate 
her just with the glow of her halo. She was certain Mary had come here 
to kill her. At its worst, Mary&#39;s radiance was agitating, bright, and 
hot on her skin. The swell of emotion accompanying Mary&#39;s aura brought 
fresh tears to her eyes. The lump in her throat threatened to cut off 
her breath, and a warm coal burned deep in the pit of her stomach and 
she let the Virgin Mother handle her.

Mary&#39;s glow overtook both Heart and Seraph for just a moment, and then 
faded out as it was replaced by Seraph&#39;s crimson and jet hues. Strands 
of demonic energy wove themselves into the paleness of Heart&#39;s aura, but 
all Seraph knew was that she could save Heart if only she loved her 
enough. She didn&#39;t know how she knew this, but the conviction of it made 
her press her hand harder against the bleeding flesh of Heart&#39;s bosom, 
made her close her eyes and concentrate with every ounce of her being on 
making Heart all right again.

Slowly, as though the pale blue was seeking its own place, tendrils of 
energy began snaking through the black and red, illuminating both of 
them in a soft lavender glow that lit up the room like daylight. They 
wove a net that surrounded both angel and demon, reaching the height of 
its intensity between Seraph&#39;s hand and Heart&#39;s chest. Lipton had to 
shield his eyes, but he noted with intrigue Mary had to as well. The 
lavender light reflected in shimmering sparkles from her pale habit, and 
Lipton wound up turning to avoid the glare.

Suddenly, Heart stirred, taking a deep breath, as though rising to the 
surface of murky waters. Seraph, shocked, moved her hand away from 
Heart&#39;s chest, revealing it to be as white and smooth as it had been 
before. The light faded, seeming to fall into them in layers, drifting 
like fallen cobweb. Seraph pulled Heart closer, and the two embraced one 
another as if their lives depended on their hanging on tightly. Seraph 
sobbed, rocking them back and forth, the angel&#39;s head buried in her 
bosom.

&quot;Well,&quot; Lipton approached Mary. &quot;I guess you&#39;ve done your good deed for 
the day.&quot;

Mary arched a brow at him.

&quot;Some of us do more than one good deed in a day,&quot; she quipped, prompting 
a smirk from him. After a pause, she added, &quot;Besides, I didn&#39;t do 
anything. They did.&quot;

Lipton nodded. &quot;Are you shocked?&quot;

Mary frowned.

&quot;Shocked? No. Surprised. Awed. The balance we&#39;ve come to accept has been 
severely disrupted. I&#39;m curious to see what the future will bring them.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re going to leave them alone?&quot; Lipton asked hopefully.

&quot;I&#39;ve got to leave town for a bit,&quot; she replied. &quot;I won&#39;t be anywhere 
near them.&quot;

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Lipton asked, his face lengthening in dismay.

Grinning, Mary replied, &quot;To do my good deed for the day.&quot;

A wry smile on his face, Lipton poked her teasingly.

&quot;I see how it is,&quot; he said. &quot;You&#39;re going off to help someone else, and 
you&#39;re just leaving us high and dry.&quot;

Mary glanced at him coquettishly, her countenance widening in mirth.

&quot;I never said that,&quot; she said, spreading her arms out wide and 
illuminating the room with her glow.

Heart and Seraph both turned to look at her as a forceful wind began to 
blow around the apartment. Mary&#39;s figure was lifted about two feet from 
the floor with no movement from her majestic, outspread wings, and a 
shower of golden motes flowed around her in a spiraling pattern. She 
glided forward, withdrawing from her robes a tarnished silver circlet, 
the one Lipton had seen her with the very day they met.

&quot;Harteriel Serafina,&quot; she said. &quot;I believe this belongs to you.&quot; She 
handed the item to Heart, then turned her full attention to Seraph. 
Heart took it with a limp arm, then let it drop. She said nothing, only 
stared in awe. The Virgin Mother smiled benevolently down at the 
succubus, her arms outspread, as though looking for a hug from a 
favorite child.

&quot;Seraph Darkfell,&quot; she announced, her voice full with the authority and 
regality of her rank. &quot;You are forgiven.&quot;

The golden dust collapsed in on itself as Mary vanished from its center, 
punctuating her ordinance with an air of finality. The whole room became 
completely silent, no one daring to move or even breath, lest they break 
the ambiance Mary had left behind.

It was Lipton who moved first, striding over to the girls and offering 
them each a hand up.

&quot;What just happened?&quot; Seraph asked him, incredulous.

&quot;I think you just got the Mother&#39;s blessing,&quot; Lipton replied, a charming 
smile on his face.

&quot;Did she say why she restored my wings?&quot; Heart asked, still woozy from 
her near-death experience.

Lipton frowned. &quot;She didn&#39;t do anything to them,&quot; he replied, stunned. 
&quot;Didn&#39;t you notice yourself flying up to the chandelier?&quot;

Heart frowned for a moment, then her face lit up. &quot;I did, didn&#39;t I!&quot;

Seraph turned, enamored, stroking her wings.

&quot;My angel,&quot; she whispered, awed by the shimmering white feathers, soft 
strands of pearl that swept gracefully down Heart&#39;s wings.

&quot;And when I first saw you at the caf&eacute;, you had them then, too,&quot; Lipton 
finalized. Heart&#39;s breath caught in her throat.

&quot;Seraph... do you know what this means?&quot; she breathed.

Seraph was snuggling Heart&#39;s wing, but she met Heart&#39;s excited gaze with 
a contented smile.

&quot;It means I haven&#39;t Fallen!&quot;

The effect on Seraph was immediate and intense. She grabbed Heart in a 
bear hug, jumping up and down with glee. Heart&#39;s head bobbed up and down 
with the impact, chagrinned by her lover&#39;s delight, but enjoying it all 
the same.

&quot;You&#39;ve got your wings back!&quot; Seraph singsonged over and over with 
child-like joy.

&quot;Seraph!&quot; Heart broke the embrace and held up the halo with a puzzled 
glance. &quot;Maybe this will explain it.&quot;

&quot;Whose halo is that?&quot; Seraph wondered, reaching out for it. It lit up 
with a light blue flame and she jerked her hand back, chuckling. &quot;Oh. 
Must be one of your spares.&quot;

Heart wasn&#39;t paying attention.

&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; She looked at Lipton with dismay. Seraph stopped and looked 
at her with curiosity. &quot;We have a guest! Our first guest!&quot; She glanced 
around the house, wincing at the damage to walls, furniture, appliances.

Seraph gave Lipton a once-over, her lips curled in a suspicious sneer.

&quot;I was sorry to hear about the club,&quot; Lipton said, hoping to placate 
her. In reply to Seraph&#39;s raised eyebrow, he added, &quot;Thor told me, on 
his way out from my place.&quot;

&quot;What else did he tell you?&quot; she hissed back.

&quot;Just to stay away from you.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Heart stopped her survey of the damage and gave her his undivided 
attention as well.

Lipton looked at both their expectant faces and quickly said, &quot;That&#39;s 
gonna take awhile to explain.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got time,&quot; Seraph said, checking a non-existent watch and tapping 
her hoof.

&quot;Seraph, let&#39;s at least try to be hospitable,&quot; Heart scolded. &quot;Why don&#39;t 
you offer our guest a drink, while I tidy up a bit.&quot;

The strained expression on Seraph&#39;s face as she followed her lover&#39;s 
suggestion amused Lipton. The succubus was reluctant, nervous, shifting 
uncomfortably from hoof to hoof as she mumbled, &quot;What do you want to 
drink.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll have a beer if you&#39;ve got one,&quot; Lipton sighed. &quot;It&#39;s been a long 
day.&quot;

As Seraph went to the kitchen, Heart wandered around the house, chanting 
in angelic. Lipton marveled once again at the simplicity and directness 
of her magick, the symphonic chords of her native language.

&quot;Clean the carpet, clean the halls/clean the kitchen, mend the 
walls/Sweep the dust and throw it out/we&#39;ve got visitors about!&quot;

Lipton ducked as a chair and a sofa flew over his head, their broken 
frames melting together into wholeness once again. Motes of dust and 
debris flew about the house, watering his eyes and running his nose, to 
fix themselves into the spots from whence they came. Plaster reapplied 
itself flawlessly to the walls, and the hardwood floor reclaimed its 
long, slender tiles from where they&#39;d been scattered by Bhaalor&#39;s 
entrance. A coffee table nearly brained him, but he took cover under it 
once it came back to its proper place.

Then came a sound from the spare bedroom that Lipton could only describe 
as a rockslide. He had but a moment to puzzle this before the gargoyles, 
fully healed by Heart&#39;s magick, flew out the door and resumed their 
perches on the balcony.

Lipton shielded himself for long moments from the flying debris, before 
he noticed the tapping hoof beside his head. He peered out from under 
the table, getting a liberal view beneath the succubus&#39;s skirt. He could 
feel himself rise to the occasion and quickly averted his eyes.

Seraph leaned over and handed him a frosty mug.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; she wondered. &quot;Scared of a little flying 
furniture?&quot;

Lipton looked past her to the angel, who was lounging in a plush 
armchair with a glass of wine. Her constructive storm was over, and the 
room was no longer the battleground it had lately been. It was the 
apartment of two beautiful girls, who loved each other more than most 
could love in a lifetime. It was a home.

Crawling out from under the table with a sheepish grin, Lipton placed 
his beer on a coaster set out for him. He sighed, reaching for a slice 
of cheese and a cracker from a dish Heart had set out. Seraph had sat on 
the sofa across from his chair, and was looking at him expectantly.

Finally, after finishing his snack, he said, &quot;I&#39;m here because almost a 
week ago I was assigned to a murder case. Multiple victims, all alleged 
gang-members. They&#39;d tried to rape a girl, and another girl came in and 
kicked their asses.&quot;

Heart and Seraph glanced at each other, their expressions in direct 
opposition. Seraph scowled, Heart winked at her.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Seraph coaxed, squirming in her seat.

&quot;Since then, I&#39;ve been laid off my case by Archangels, fought angels 
alongside a mythological god, and am being lusted after by the Mother of 
Christ. All because of you two.&quot;

&quot;Us?&quot; Heart asked, dismay marring her pretty face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry if we made 
you have a bad week.&quot;

Lipton offered her a quick grin in response.

&quot;Tell me more about the Archangels,&quot; Seraph leaned forward, now 
interested. &quot;Was it those horse-heads that tried to come in through the 
balcony?&quot;

Lipton shook his head. &quot;No, it was Gabriel and Michael.&quot;

Seraph whistled and sat back in her seat. Heart&#39;s jaw dropped at the 
mention of the names, and her face paled.

&quot;I don&#39;t think they&#39;re after you guys!&quot; Lipton assured her. &quot;They&#39;re the 
ones who closed my case. They&#39;ve got it explained as a mob hit, nothing 
to do with either of you. Besides, they&#39;ve seen you dance, Miss 
Darkfell, and they didn&#39;t attack then.&quot;

Seraph refused to be placated. To Heart, she said, &quot;We&#39;ve got to watch 
our backs for a bit, beloved.&quot;

Heart nodded, but without much conviction. She looked at the detective, 
eyes pleading.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you think they&#39;re after us?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Lipton began, after a huge swallow of beer. &quot;When I got handed 
the case, I suspected a few things right away...&quot;

Before Lipton had a chance to continue, the slight draft that was 
slipping under the balcony doors became a sudden breeze. All three 
turned warily to the doors, wind whipping the girls&#39; hair, but the doors 
remained shut. Before they&#39;d completely turned back to give one another 
a puzzled glance, a rainbow shower of sparkling motes appeared over the 
edge of the table that was closest to Heart. She stood in surprise; 
Seraph likewise rose, her trident in her hands.

The magical glimmer took on a rectangular shape, began to solidify. With 
a final punctuation from the wind, it formed the shape of a sealed 
envelope, which drifted, feather-like, down to the table. It was a plain 
white envelope with a tiny heart logo in the return address corner.

Heart tore open the envelope and pulled out a single sheet of white 
paper with red lettering, and a very short message in the center. The 
letterhead was a pair of hearts, linked together in a stylized airbrush 
scrawl, bearing the words &quot;Heavenly Hearts; a division of Fisher 
Enterprises.&quot;

The words in the center were: Harteriel Serafina and Seraph Darkfell: 
MATCH APPROVED.</pre>
