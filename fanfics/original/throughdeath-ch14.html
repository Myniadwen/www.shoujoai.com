<h1>Through Death Comes Life (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/throughdeath-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>      &quot;...you&#39;re...what...?&quot; Eveon asked, slowly, looking between the two women sitting in 
front of her. &quot;I&#39;m pregnant,&quot; Abby said gently, hoping her daughter was listening. The 
blonde adolescent gave Abby a strange stare before looking incredulously at Sakura.

      &quot;Sakura is a woman, right? Like, everything about her is female... right? I mean, if 
you weren&#39;t, Sakura, that&#39;s be cool too, but, uh,&quot; Eveon bit down on her lower lip, &quot;They 
didn&#39;t cover this is health class.&quot; There was a moment of silence.

      &quot;But Mommy, there&#39;s no way you can be eggo prego.&quot; Abby let out an exasperated sigh, 
while Sakura scratched her head awkwardly. &quot;Eveon, seriously. I took like, six pregnancy 
tests and they&#39;re all positive. I&#39;d also bet all my savings that I&#39;m giving birth to a 
girl.&quot;

      Sakura blushed at that and instinctively ran her hand over Abby&#39;s stomach. Eveon took 
a deep breath and smiled. &quot;So, uh... that means I&#39;m going to be a big sister, right?&quot; Both 
women nodded. &quot;...but, how do you know it&#39;s going to be a girl...?&quot;

      Abby and Sakura looked over at each other. &quot;I think,&quot; Sakura murmured, &quot;we should 
consult everyone else before we sort this out.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;You have got to be kidding me.&quot;

      Isaka&#39;s statement practically summed up everyone&#39;s reactions upon finding out. &quot;Last I 
checked, no female of any race, be it demon, angel, human or something in between, could 
impregnate another woman,&quot; Krystal said. Mina was currently gushing with Eveon about having 
a little sister and all the things they could do as big sisters and such.

      Seth looked like he&#39;d been hit with a train. &quot;Abby&#39;s pregnant... with Sakura&#39;s kid?&quot; 
He murmured this quietly to himself, as though trying to wrap his mind around it. Erin and 
Faye, however, didn&#39;t seem the least bit faze. &quot;Well,&quot; the Goddess of Love said, &quot;I think we 
need to give Tycara a lot more credit... that sly, sly girl...&quot;

      Abby smiled. &quot;I had a feeling it was her... she used to say she wanted me to be her 
mother, so...&quot; She looked over at Sakura. &quot;The two of us can take care of her as her 
parents...&quot; The angel had a rare smile on her face, holding the hand of her lover.

      Erin scratched her head, looking confused. &quot;I realize it&#39;s possible for Tycara to do 
that, but how...? Faye, you were best friend with the Goddess of Parenting, so...&quot; The red 
head nodded before adjusting her baseball cap.

      &quot;Since Tycara&#39;s soul was dormant inside Abby&#39;s body, we can assume that she realized 
what was going to happen. Tycara wouldn&#39;t want Abby to die for her, so as their souls 
started to mingle a bit, she was able to manipulate Abby&#39;s body... and by manipulating 
Abby&#39;s body, I mean preparing for herself to be reborn,&quot; Faye said triumphantly, everyone 
else secretly wondering how she knew so much.

      &quot;Except... well, the soul is the blueprint of a person, so it keeps the most important 
things, like important memories, individuality, and all that great stuff. However, Tycara 
couldn&#39;t just remake herself solely using Abby&#39;s body.&quot; Everyone looked over at the pair and 
Sakura noticeably fidgeted.

      &quot;Tycara&#39;s soul must have known you were her biological mother, even if her conscious 
mind wasn&#39;t aware of it. So, as soon as you two...&quot; Faye paused, trying to think of a 
euphemism, &quot;As soon as you two consummated your love, Tycara was able to access the 
remaining parts she needed to initiate her rebirth.&quot;

      Abby kind of felt like a jackass now. No wonder Tycara said &#39;the seed is planted&#39; in 
her dream! She was trying to tell her that she was pregnant... Suddenly, Seth stood up and 
said, &quot;Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! If Tycara&#39;s going to be reborn as a baby, then... then...&quot; He 
sunk down in his chair, dejected. &quot;...does this make me some sort of pedophile...?&quot;

      Erin piped up on his behalf, &quot;Considering Abby and Sakura have only been together a 
few days, the pregnancy tests shouldn&#39;t have worked so well... I&#39;m guessing since Tycara&#39;s 
angel-demon heritage is within her soul, she has enough power to accelerate her growth. 
She&#39;ll probably give birth in... a month or so?&quot;

      &quot;What?&quot; Eveon said in disbelief. &quot;That&#39;s... wow...&quot; Mina said, sounding just as 
amazed. Abby shrugged. &quot;I&#39;ll take one month instead of nine any day.&quot; Isaka stood up and 
said, &quot;Only a month? That&#39;s my little sister you have inside of you! Krystal,&quot; She looked 
over at her lover, &quot;We only have a month to plan a baby shower and get everything Abby needs 
to have a good birth and... and... gah!&quot;

      As Krystal tried to calm her demon, Mina said, &quot;Don&#39;t you... need a doctor to give 
birth?&quot; Erin chuckled, &quot;I don&#39;t think a doctor would believe this... since she&#39;s giving 
birth soon, it&#39;ll have to be a home delivery.&quot; Faye nodded in agreement. &quot;Yep, I&#39;ll take 
care of it. And I thought I would never have to use those child rearing skills I learning 
from the Goddess of Parenting...&quot;

      As everyone started talking about preparations, what to buy and how to console poor 
Seth, Abby slipped away with Sakura. 

***** 

      &quot;...I&#39;m afraid that she&#39;ll hate me...&quot; Sakura said in choked whisper, lying next to 
Abby in the bed. &quot;Shh, she doesn&#39;t hate you. If she did she wouldn&#39;t have been so happy in 
my dreams.&quot; She ran a hand through Sakura&#39;s snowy white locks before giving her a nice, long 
kiss.

      &quot;...I&#39;m so happy...! Everything I&#39;ve ever wanted is here,&quot; Sakura said, holding Abby 
in a tight embrace. The blonde woman returned the hug best she could, running her hands up 
and down the scars on Sakura&#39;s back.

      &quot;I&#39;m happy too. I just hope that after I give birth, I start growing old again. Being 
younger is nice, until you realize you can&#39;t go out in public,&quot; Sakura pulled away to let 
her forehead rest gently against Abby&#39;s. &quot;Sometimes... I wish that you were immortal so I 
won&#39;t have to watch you die and we can... we can stay together forever... other times, I 
want my humanity back so we can grow old and depart life together.&quot;

      Abby let out a happy sigh before propping herself up on her elbow. &quot;...whatever makes 
you happy, Sakura... whatever choice you wish to make, then make it.&quot; She started to absent 
mindedly traced the scars on Sakura&#39;s back, the woman below her shivering in response. 
&quot;...no matter what you do, I&#39;ll always love you...&quot;

      Abby leaned down and began leaving slow, sensual kiss on Sakura&#39;s shoulder blades. She 
shuddered and let out a happy sigh. Abby nipped at her neck and said. &quot;...even if I am 
pregnant, I haven&#39;t started showing yet. I doubt Tycara will mind...&quot; Sakura got the hint 
and turned over.

      Without warning, the blonde was flipped onto her back, her ardent lover on top of her. 
&quot;For someone so shy and mysterious, you do like being on top...&quot; Sakura gave her a soft 
smile. &quot;Only so I can see the beauty of your soul come out when I make love to you.&quot;

      Abby&#39;s laugh soon melted into a soft moan as Sakura&#39;s mouth trailed down to sensitive 
places. 

***** 

      &quot;There are many things you have to decide now, Abby,&quot; Krystal said, thumbing through a 
parenting book, &quot;I wish me and Isaka could have children...&quot; The demon sitting next to her 
looked a little downcast and whispered to the two goddesses behind her, &quot;Don&#39;t you guys have 
a spell or something so we can have kids?&quot;

      Faye shook her head and Erin only said, &quot;If we knew a way, I&#39;m sure one of us would be 
pregnant right now...&quot; Isaka let out a long sigh before looking over at Krystal. Imagining 
her sweet little exorcist pregnant with her demon children was such a thrilling thought. So 
thrilling that she was half tempted to drag Krystal to a bedroom and try.

      Seth, on the other hand, was busy writing a shopping list. Eveon had just come home 
with Mina, so the two girls were helping the young man. It had been a week since Abby found 
out she was pregnant and her belly swelled since then. She was currently sitting on the 
couch, leaning happily against Sakura. &quot;...you guys are acting like I&#39;ve never given birth 
before...&quot; Eveon shrugged. &quot;Well, mommy, it&#39;s been over 15 years... lots of things have 
changed.&quot; The blonde let out a sigh as Sakura gave her a comforting kiss.

      &quot;Alright,&quot; Krystal said, looking at the book, &quot;Abby, Sakura... you need to decide if 
you&#39;re going to breast feed Tycara or use formula so Seth can finish the shopping list.&quot; 
Everyone looked at the soon to be mothers in anticipation.

      Abby looked over at Eveon. &quot;Well... I breast fed Eveon and we all know how she turned 
out.&quot; Eveon flushed a bright red and Mina just kind of stared at Abby&#39;s chest before saying, 
&quot;Wow. I can understand how that might affect somebody.&quot;

      &quot;Mina! That&#39;s gross,&quot; Eveon said, trying to hide her red face. Mina just laughed and 
said, &quot;Well, don&#39;t worry... if you ever have the urge to be an infant again, I&#39;d be happy to 
help.&quot; The blonde girl looked about ready to dig a hole.

      &quot;I... I think you should use formula, then,&quot; Seth said. Isaka scoffed and said, &quot;Hell 
no. Breast feed her.&quot; Seth whipped around at that. &quot;What? Are you trying to sabotage me, 
Isaka? It&#39;s already bad enough that I have to wait for Tycara, even if her growth is 
accelerated...&quot;

      The demon grinned an evil grin. &quot;Don&#39;t you see, Seth? My little sister will be reborn 
and I will have a second chance to convince her that guys aren&#39;t the way to go! Don&#39;t get 
your boxers in a bunch... I keep offering to turn you into a girl, anyways.&quot;

      Seth gritted his teeth and stood up. &quot;Do you think I&#39;m going to take that chance?&quot; 
Isaka stood up as well. &quot;Oh please, pretty boy. You&#39;re the odd man out, so why don&#39;t you 
want to be a lesbian? It&#39;s like a male fantasy!&quot; The young man massaged his temples. &quot;What 
is wrong with you, Isaka?&quot;

      As they continued their fighting, Erin said to Faye, &quot;This is even more heated than 
those commercials about formula vs. breast feeding...&quot; The love goddess nodded. &quot;Indeed... 
but Seth would make a cute girl...&quot; The red head got a little nip at the ear for that.

      Suddenly, amidst the chaos, a voice whispered, &quot;I think you should breast feed her.&quot; 
Everyone turned to see that it was Sakura who had spoken. &quot;I breast fed Tycara so I think 
it&#39;d be better this way.&quot; Isaka smirked at Seth, but the young man shrugged. &quot;Whatever would 
be better for Tycara is fine. I mean, breast feeding has no correlation with preferences 
seeing as how she still likes me.&quot;

      Isaka rolled her eyes and sat down next to Krystal, who was still thumbing through the 
parenting book. &quot;Alright,&quot; Mina said, holding up a list. &quot;We&#39;ve finished the list, but... 
who&#39;ll do the shopping?&quot; Obviously, the two teens and young man who compounded the list 
couldn&#39;t do it without being embarrassed so...

      &quot;Me and Isaka will take care of it,&quot; Krystal said, taking the sheet of paper from the 
young girl. 

***** 

      &quot;...How can there be so many types of diapers?&quot; Isaka stared at the store shelves, one 
hand on the cart. &quot;Well, there&#39;s all kinds for age, protection, size absorbency...&quot; Krystal 
was perusing through the packages, trying to guess at what kinds to buy.

      &quot;Can&#39;t we wait until Tycara is actually born to do this?&quot; Krystal shook her head and 
finally picked a package. &quot;Since it&#39;s going to be a home delivery, we&#39;ll need diapers. I 
don&#39;t doubt Tycara, it&#39;s just... I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not going to be used to her body. Plus,&quot; 
Krystal said with a smile, &quot;I doubt she&#39;ll mind. She&#39;s going to have two wonderful mothers.&quot;

      Isaka watched Krystal place the diapers in the cart before sighing. &quot;I&#39;m kind of 
jealous,&quot; the demon said, &quot;I would love for you to have our kids.&quot; Krystal blushed at the 
thought. &quot;Oh, Isaka... that would be great, but it&#39;s kind of impossible. Unless you want 
Seth to be a sperm donor-&quot;

      When Isaka shouted no, half the store turned to stare at the pair of young women. As 
if they hadn&#39;t looked strange enough with a cart full of baby products. 

***** 

      &quot;...so this is what a pregnant woman looks like...&quot;

      Abby found Eveon&#39;s comment quite strange. &quot;You&#39;ve seen pregnant women before.&quot; The 
blonde girl placed a hand on her swollen abdomen. &quot;Well, it&#39;s kind of funny. You&#39;re still 
skinny except for, you know.&quot; It had already been three weeks and Abby felt weird.

      Then again, having the pregnancy process sped up would make her body feel strange. 
&quot;Where&#39;s Sakura?&quot; Eveon asked, sitting down next to her mother on the couch. Abby shrugged. 
&quot;She just disappears. She says she has &#39;work&#39; which means she&#39;s guiding souls to the 
afterlife or whatever it is she does...&quot;

      Silence permeated the room as both females contemplated the thought. &quot;So... since you 
and Sakura are... you know, she&#39;s like my other mommy right?&quot; Abby only nodded and said, &quot;I 
guess so... and soon you&#39;re going to have a kid sister!&quot;

      Eveon grinned, but Abby couldn&#39;t help but wonder where Sakura was. 

***** 

      Abby had been sleeping on her side when she awoke to a pair of arms wrapping around 
her. Soft, gentle hands caressed her belly and an eager pair of lips moved against her neck. 
&quot;Mmm... Sakura... where were you?&quot; Abby would have turned over, but she couldn&#39;t in her 
state. &quot;...just working on a few negotiations...&quot;

      That made little sense to the blonde woman, so she went back to sleep. 

***** 

      &quot;Just pop already!&quot;

      Krystal gave Isaka a small whack on the head for saying that. Abby knew she was close 
to giving birth, but the demon didn&#39;t have to be so crude. &quot;Alright, when her water does 
break, me and Erin will take care of her,&quot; Faye said, her lover currently setting up the 
birthing room.

      The blonde mother rolled her eyes. &quot;Oh, come on. I think I may have a day or two...&quot; 
Seth was sitting in a chair wringing his hands. &quot;Oh, what if Tycara doesn&#39;t have a growth 
spurt? What if I have to wait 18 years?&quot;

      Krystal patted him on the shoulder. &quot;Don&#39;t worry Seth... I&#39;m sure Tycara will grow up 
fast. She is the only angel-demon hybrid to ever exist.&quot; He didn&#39;t look too relieved.

      Eveon and Mina were still at school, but Sakura was right next to Abby, caressing her 
hand. Her belly had swollen up and she knew the baby would be coming pretty soon.
