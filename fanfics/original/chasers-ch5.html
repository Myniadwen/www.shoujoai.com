<a href="../original/chasers-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Kate sat in the chair silently, her gaze meeting the young woman in the 
suit sitting across the office from her. Her short brown hair fell into 
her eyes occasionally, but other than that the scruffy looking young 
woman just sat there.

The quiet stretched onward, until finally the woman said, &quot;I can&#39;t do 
anything to help you, if you don&#39;t talk to me at least.&quot;

A little smirk crossed Kate&#39;s face, &quot;They ordered me to attend these 
sessions with you, but they didn&#39;t say anything about actually 
participating in them.&quot; She sat up, looking at the clock, &quot;Are we done 
yet, doc ?&quot;

&quot;Close enough,&quot; the young woman quietly sighed. In a moment Kate was up 
out of her chair and out the door labeled Dr. Alexis Jameson. The dark 
hared woman took off her glasses a moment to gently rub at her eyes. 
&quot;That woman is infuriating,&quot; she growled.

Alexis got up to look out her window at the nearby elevated roadway. 
Kate was pulling on her jacket as she almost ran out of the building, 
jumped into her car, and squealed the tires as she was leaving. Alexis 
sighed softly and walked over to her desk.

&quot;Gwen, if I find out that you arranged for her to be sent to me on 
purpose, I will so kill you,&quot; Alexis muttered under her breath before 
sitting down behind her large desk. She pulled her computer out of a 
desk drawer and reactivated it, scrolling through the records she had 
been sent until she finally reached Kate&#39;s file.

Kate Williams: Born 2045, Chicago, North America. Parents emigrated to 
Tokyo in 2053, killed in android related incident in 2057.

&quot;What?&quot; Alexis blinked in surprise, and hit the link for more 
information.

One of the first Android related homicides, the Williams&#39; household unit 
had a serious logic failure. Operating under delusion that humans were 
simply machines in need of repair, it disassembled both Mr. and Mrs. 
Williams. Their daughter was trapped in the suite with the android until 
rescued by police units responding to her cries for help.

&quot;That explains a lot,&quot; Alexis murmured. Part of why Kate had been 
ordered to attend these sessions was because of her over-reaction to an 
android crime a few months ago. &#39;I suppose from her point of view, it 
wasn&#39;t,&#39; she mused before continuing to read.

Placed in the state&#39;s care until she reached the age of twenty. She 
demonstrated a classic rebellion against authority during this period, 
and was charged several times with misdemeanors. After a short period in 
prison she applied to join police force and succeeded on her second 
attempt.

&quot;She was in jail?&quot; a startled Alexis said aloud.

Kate&#39;s rather long police file came up next, a mix of both glowing 
commendations and harsh reprimands. Just a casual perusal showed Alexis 
that Kate had actively sought out the android crimes even before the 
Chasers were formed. At times, she had even put herself in serious 
jeopardy just to stop a android criminal.

&#39;Self-destructive impulse, maybe?&#39; Alexis wondered. She closed down the 
file, deeply troubled by what she had just read. &#39;Obviously she was 
deeply traumatized by what happened to her parents. No record of her 
receiving any therapy back then, either. It certainly explains her 
hatred for AI&#39;s in general, too,&#39; she thought.

Her com&#39; chimed, and with a frown Alexis picked it up. Her expression 
became even more hostile, if that was possible, once she saw who was 
calling her. &quot;Gwen, what can I do for you?&quot; she asked her former lover 
coldly.



Gwen had to fight the urge to smile at the peeved look on Alexis&#39; face. 
&#39;Obviously, Kate&#39;s been a tough nut for her to crack,&#39; she thought. &quot;So 
how are things going with Kate?&quot; she cheerfully asked her aloud.

Alexis gave the stylish Asian woman a glare that could have melted 
steel. &quot;You know I can&#39;t discuss someone who is my patient,&quot; she 
growled.

&quot;I&#39;m also her commanding officer,&quot; Gwen said with deceptive mildness, 
&quot;and I need to know if she&#39;s a danger to herself or others.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Alexis sighed. Rather reluctantly, she confessed, &quot;She 
won&#39;t talk to me, just sits there until the session&#39;s over.&quot; She winced, 
as Gwen hooted with laughter.

Gwen quickly managed to get herself back under control, &quot;I&#39;m terribly 
sorry.&quot; She took a steadying breath, &quot;I just found myself imagining her 
sitting with her arms crossed and holding her breath like some little 
kid.&quot;

A smile quirked Alexis&#39; lips, too. &quot;After reviewing her records I can 
say this,&quot; she said a bit more seriously, &quot;she&#39;s been bottling up stuff 
for a long time, and I&#39;m concerned that one day she&#39;s going to explode.&quot;

&quot;Stuff?&quot; Gwen chuckled.

&quot;If you&#39;d prefer I can use more sophisticated psychiatric terms,&quot; Alexis 
answered dryly. She paused, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

Gwen sighed softly. &quot;I think you may be right,&quot; she admitted. They 
exchanged pleasantries for a few moments, then she asked, &quot;How about 
dinner?&quot;

Alexis looked a bit startled. &quot;It&#39;s dead, love, and I doubt even you can 
revive it,&quot; she smiled at Gwen wryly, referring to their abortive love 
affair a few months ago.

&quot;Just a friendly meal,&quot; Gwen held up her hands, &quot;no funny business, I 
swear.&quot;

Alexis looked at her skeptically, then finally nodded, &quot;All right, just 
dinner.&quot; They set a time and a place to meet, then Gwen signed off.

Gwen slid up her sleeve to check her chronometer, then got up from her 
desk and strode over to the lift. She ascended quickly, rising above the 
levels of middle management right to the executive levels. The meeting 
room was unlocked, and she noticed the caliber of brass admiringly. She 
walked up to the podium and began her briefing.

&quot;Some of this you may already know,&quot; Gwen began, &quot;but I&#39;m going to run 
through it all anyway. After my presentation, I&#39;ll be taking questions 
and comments.&quot;

She took a deep breath, then began, &quot;An advanced robotics technology was 
developed in the late 2040&#39;s, allowing for the creation of robotic 
brains with the capacity to learn. Picking up the likes and dislikes of 
their owners and coupled with far more humanoid bodies, these robots 
became a craze, spreading around the world. However, it took a few years 
before the fundamental flaw in the brains became apparent.

Accumulating knowledge and experience, a small percentage of the robots 
began to become truly self aware. They often simply slip away from their 
owners, burning away their ID numbers and any other tracers, then 
slipping away into the underground.

But other robots cannot reconcile their masters irrational and confusing 
behavior with their machine logic, and suffer what becomes known as a 
&#39;logic-failure&#39;. They effectively go insane, and some become violent.

Ironically, we&#39;ve discovered that the best way to deal with violent 
androids has been to fall back on more primitive technology. Chemically 
propelled slugs can penetrate Android bodies quite effectively, and a 
properly placed shot can easily disable them.&quot;

One of the captains of a neighboring district got up, &quot;We&#39;re beginning 
to look into the prospect of capturing free-wills. What is your 
opinion?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a bad idea,&quot; Gwen said simply.

A moment of silence, then her own superior asked, &quot;And why is that?&quot;

&quot;The precise legal status of the free-wills has been largely undefined 
so far,&quot; Gwen calmly said, &quot;but if we start arresting or even destroying 
them, I feel certain some pro-bono lawyer will raise the question of 
whether they qualify as being sentient.&quot; She paused, &quot;Either way it 
turns out, it will be a media and political firestorm.&quot;

A long silence, as the brass digested that. Several of them who were up 
for advancement or considering possible political careers looked quite 
uncomfortable at the prospect. Finally, her superior spoke up, &quot;I think 
we&#39;ll put that on hold, for the time being.&quot;

&#39;I&#39;ve bought you some time,&#39; Gwen thought to herself grimly even as she 
smiled pleasantly and sat back down.



Kate strode into the Chasers&#39; wing of the headquarters, &quot;Where&#39;s Gwen?&quot;

Beth blew a bubble, popped it, &quot;Upstairs, dealing with the brass.&quot;

Kate shuddered, &quot;I don&#39;t envy her that.&quot; She looked at Beth curiously, 
&quot;You went out with Jen on the last one, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Beth frowned. Her T-shirt was so badly torn it didn&#39;t conceal 
very much, and the skin tight leggings she wore weren&#39;t that modest 
either.

&quot;How&#39;d she do?&quot; Kate asked impatiently.

&quot;She handled her self fine,&quot; and Beth chuckled softly, remembering. 
Quite cheerfully, &quot;Can you believe she volunteered for this duty?&quot;

An odd look passed Kate&#39;s face. &quot;Some people do,&quot; she said quietly, and 
then quickly headed off to her little office.

&#39;Oh hell,&#39; Beth remembered, &#39;Lynn volunteered, didn&#39;t she?&#39;

Jen smiled at Kate, &quot;Good afternoon.&quot;

Kate just snarled at her in reply.

&quot;I&#39;m beginning to think she doesn&#39;t like me,&quot; Jen sighed to Beth 
quietly. Beth shrugged helplessly in reply.
