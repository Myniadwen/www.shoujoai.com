<h1>Magical Sword Princess Aoi (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Even a life-long prosperity is but one cup of sake; 
A life of forty-nine years is passed in a dream; 
I know not what life is, nor death. 
Year in year out-all but a dream. 
Both Heaven and Hell are left behind; 
I stand in the moonlit dawn, 
Free from clouds of attachment.

Uesugi Kenshin 1530-78  (Suzuki Zen and Japanese Culture pg. 82) 

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Chapter One: Mysterious Child of Magic 

A desperately cold wind blew through ashen base drifts of mountain 
born snow. Aoi Ryudouji clung tightly to the outer robes she had 
donned in preparation for the trip to Yuki-mura, the snow village. As 
she plunged through the ankle-high pillows of snow in her way, she 
took a look behind her. Tagging slowly behind were her partners and 
friends, Kazuki Ougano and Natsuna Tsunagu.  

The powerful martial artist and the skilled healer. Alongside Aoi, the 
master of the self-styled Shingetsuken style of swordplay, they formed 
the dreaded team of mercenary warriors known as the Kagami Bandits. 
The three of them took up any mission that caught their fancy, and 
travelled the exotic world of You&#146;aen as they so pleased. 

Right now, there was no frivolous journey they were taking. This was 
strictly business. They had a mission to tend to. Slowly, Aoi turned 
her head around, lowering the hood over her head to stare at Kazuki 
and Natsuna. 

&#147;Kazuki...&#148; She began. &#147;How much further do we have to go before we 
reach Yuki-mura?&#148;

The man in question thought for a second. Though he took a laid back 
look at life, he always liked to know where life would take him. And 
so Kazuki was a man that took great pride in travel and journeying. 
There was no place he did not know of in You&#146;aen. 

Kazuki clutched the sides of his arms and rubbed feverishly to warm 
himself up. &#147;Not too far, Aoi. I&#146;ve been here a couple of times 
before; it&#146;s not a long trip. Just try to relax a bit. Once we take 
care of this mission, we&#146;ll be swimming in gold pieces.&#148;

Natsuna heaved a sigh. True, the mission did pay well, but the person 
paying the fee... &#147;I still have misgiving about trusting Ietsuna 
Kagutaira.&#148;

Kazuki looked over to the raven-haired Natsuna. &#147;Why do you say that? 
He seems trustworthy enough. And he offered us 20,000 gold pieces for 
a pretty easy job.&#148;

&#147;That is exactly my point.&#148; Natsuna said directly. &#147;He hired us, the 
Kagami Bandits, and is going to pay us with a sum of money that would 
cure any poor village&#146;s worries. All to retrieve some girl? Does that 
not seem to be a bit much?&#148;

As they continued walking, Aoi (as rare as it was) interjected. &#147;But 
this isn&#146;t just any ordinary girl. She is a magic user. Not like you, 
Natsuna. A *real* magic user. They were supposed to have died out 
hundreds of years ago during the Great Wars. If you believe in that 
sort of thing.&#148;

Natsuna thought about that for a second. The Great Wars were a bloody 
time in the history of You&#146;aen. Twenty years of war against foreign 
enemies that were &#145;unnatural&#146; in nature. Hundreds of thousands of 
lives were lost in those battles. The aged and now extinct religion of 
Shinkou argued that those wars were punishment from God for humanity&#146;s 
self-indulgence and greed. This was a long time ago however, and most 
people had come to believe the wars never happened at all. But magic 
was very real. So real that it was feared. And by following history, 
the last recorded magic user died out at the same time the Great Wars 
ended. So it was no surprise that some people believed that the Great 
Wars were real. 

Natsuna was not sceptical. She believed in the wars with all her 
heart. Which was why she was looking forward to meeting this so-called 
&#145;true&#146; magic user. &#147;I&#146;m anxious to meet her.&#148; Natsuna said, with a 
small smile on her lips. 

With his usual, flirtatious self, Kazuki chipped in. &#147;Yeah! I hear 
she&#146;s fairly...&#148;

Natsuna looked at Kazuki oddly as he stopped himself. &#147;Fairly what?&#148;

&#147;You smell that?&#148; The auburn-haired man said, thinking hard. &#147;It 
smells like... smoke or something.&#148;

Aoi and Natsuna looked away from Kazuki and stared around the snowy 
area of this mountain path. As they continued walking forward, they 
came across a high cliff over looking the snowy village of Yuki-mura. 
A village that was in flames. 

Natsuna&#146;s dark brown eyes went wide. &#147;Oh great, this is all we need. 
Somebody is attacking the village.&#148;

Kazuki looked at the village down below. Dozens of people were 
screaming in terror, and more were being chased by an odd group of 
people. They were dressed in pure white body suits, with swords 
strapped to their backs. It looked like there were searching for 
something, or someone. 

&#147;I don&#146;t know who those guys are,&#148; Kazuki cracked his knuckles. &#147;But 
if they&#146;re gonna tear apart a village just to find something then I 
think my fist is gonna get itself involved.&#148;

The quiet Aoi spoke up. &#147;I don&#146;t want to involve myself with the 
affairs of this village but... our charge is living inside it. We&#146;ll 
have to go get the girl before those people injure her. We might as 
well help the villagers expel them.&#148; 

Kazuki grinned at Aoi. &#147;That&#146;s cute, Aoi. I didn&#146;t know you cared so 
much.&#148;

Aoi crossed her arms, looking away. &#147;I don&#146;t care either way. We have 
a job to do and if we fail, we&#146;ll lose face. Not that I care about 
Ietsuna&#146;s opinion, either.&#148; 

Kazuki chuckled a little. Aoi was very cold person, but he could 
always see through that frozen shell of hers. &#147;Okay Aoi, you loving 
humanitarian. Lets clean those guys out.&#148;

With that, Aoi, Kazuki and Natsuna expertly leapt down the snowy 
cliffs towards the burning Yuki-mura.   

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&#147;Tell us where the girl is!&#148;

A poor man, of around 38 years in age, trembled in fear as one of the 
attacking assailant. He sleekly pulled out the Tanto knife from the 
back of his suit, and held it up to the pauper&#146;s neck, still spouting 
hateful and direct orders.

&#147;Tell me!&#148; He screamed, &#147;Tell me where the girl is or I will kill you 
here and now! Do you wish me to do that?&#148;

The poverty stricken man shook his head. &#147;N-No, please, don&#146;t! I don&#146;t 
know who you are talking about, I&#146;m sorry!&#148;

&#147;Errgh!&#148; The white-suited attacker tossed the poor man to one side of 
the sidewall of a small hut. He stood up and looked around the place. 
The eastern and northern parts of the village were on fire, and many 
of the villagers were being cut down like cattle. This was not what 
they had come for. But still, they had their objectives. Nothing, not 
even innocent lives, could get in the way of it.

Just as the man turned around to meet up with the rest of his group, 
Aoi leapt down from a neighbouring hut to meet with him face to face. 

The attacker took a look at this girl. Her face was garlanded by short 
blonde hair, with long tresses at the front, keeping only one of her 
shining blue eyes in view. At her neck was a precious necklace, a 
sapphire stone linked to a silver chain. Her attire was suited to a 
swordfighter of You&#146;aen. A Yoroi hitatare form of dress, obviously 
adapted for a woman, coloured in white and blue. There was a symbol on 
the back of her garments, one that indicated the house of her 
swordplay style. The attacker could not recognise it, but he would 
have a fun time figuring it out.  

Aoi placed a firm hand on the hilt of her sword, keeping her blue eyes 
on this man. &#147;Who are you? Why are you attacking this village?&#148;

The man smiled, sheathing his Tanto and drawing his long sword. &#147;So 
you are a swordswoman, eh? Women have absolutely no place on the 
battlefield, my dear. You do not follow the Codes of Hokori, do you?&#148;

Aoi&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;Woman or not, that does not alter skill. Don&#146;t 
mistake femininity for weakness. The Codes of Hokori are antiquated 
and obsolete. I follow the Order of Hizashi.&#148;

&#147;It figures.&#148; He said, lifting his sword into both hands. &#147;Then lets 
see what you know. Anyone who stands in our way must be cut down.&#148;

Breathing a hard breath, Aoi gripped her sword, &#145;Raiha&#146; and pulled it 
free from its sheath. She grabbed it with both hands, holding a steady 
grip on her blade and locked eyes with this man. He wasn&#146;t like the 
other attackers; he seemed to actually be in control of their whole 
group. This was good for Aoi, however. When the brain is crushed, the 
body will follow. 

The attacker charged at Aoi with his sword at the ready, and as soon 
as he got close enough, he slashed at her in a diagonal cutting 
manner. Aoi tilted Raiha to a horizontal position, blocking the move 
with a streak of gold friction passing along two clashing blades. The 
assailant swished his sword at her again, in a vertical swipe. Aoi saw 
this with ease, and sidestepped to one side of his body. 

&#147;That&#146;s a foolish mistake.&#148; Aoi thought. 

Now that she had a clear advantage over him, Aoi prepared to strike. 
However the man just grinned, crouching down and slashing his sword at 
Aoi&#146;s ankles. The Kagami Bandit was caught well off guard, and did the 
only thing she could think of, and that was jump. She leaped straight 
off the patchy snow and into the cool night air. The second she 
reached the peak of her jump; Aoi slashed her sword around her body in 
a half moon motion, creating a thin slicing wave motion. The attacker 
leader was confused, she was attacking from such a great distance, but 
he gasped as the sleeve of his shirt was cut open, revealing a shallow 
gash in his flesh. 

Aoi landed a short distance away, still holding her sword in defensive 
stance. The man just stared at Aoi, shocked, but also in some crazy 
way, thrilled. 

&#147;I do not believe it...&#148; He said surprised. &#147;That was air wave stroke 
of the Sajia&#146;en School. Are you a student of Sajia&#146;en Kaira?&#148;

The gaze of her strong sky blue eyes did not weaken, but Aoi allowed 
herself to answer that. &#147;That is correct. Master Kaira instructed me 
long ago. How do *you* know of him?&#148; 

The man grinned. &#147;He and I trained together when we were children. We 
mastered that move together. But he had never told me that he adapted 
that move aerially. So... he ended up training women. He always said 
he would.&#148;

&#147;Who are you?&#148; Aoi pressed that harder. Training with Sajia&#146;en Kaira 
and his son, Sajia&#146;en Keiichi was a very personal thing. Kaira was the 
man who raised and trained her. This man was more than he seemed. 

The attacker sheathed his sword. &#147;My name is Koukuji Yoshinaga. I lead 
this group, the Himitsu Rikugun. In honour of your teacher, I will 
spare your life today. But we will come back for the girl. Just be 
ready to face me then.&#148;

Yoshinaga leapt up to the top of the hut with a grin then whistled 
into the air. Each of the white-clad attackers listened well, stopped 
what they were doing and began to flee. It was a call to retreat. Aoi 
watched on as the twenty or so men dashed out of the village rapidly, 
along with Yoshinaga. Quickly sheathing Raiha, she ran over to the 
other side of the settlement to see how Kazuki and Natsuna were making 
out. 

Kazuki fought off the last of the Himitsu Rikugun troops, while 
Natsuna took care of some of the ailing villagers. Aoi slid to a stop 
as she neared Kazuki. 

&#147;Are you alright?&#148; She asked. 

Kazuki just grinned. &#147;I&#146;m fine! You think I can&#146;t handle those 
amateurs? I took care of them in no time at all. Natsuna&#146;s handling 
all the injuries of the villagers too. But we have more important 
things to worry about.&#148;

Kazuki turned around to look at the fire raging a few metres away from 
him and Aoi. &#147;We gotta put out that fire. But the natural well that 
they draw water from is all the way across the village. We can&#146;t get 
water here to stop it from spreading into another area.&#148;

Aoi gritted her teeth hard. She didn&#146;t want to be involved in this and 
she was more pre-occupied with Yoshinaga, but it was the right thing 
to do. But before she even made a step, Aoi and Kazuki&#146;s ears rang 
with the sound of a woman&#146;s voice... chanting.

The girl stood by the fire, her arms outstretched and her long black 
hair flowing in the now hot breeze. 

&#147;Mahou shiki... Mizu!&#148;

A jet of powerful, compressed water shot from her hands, in a spinning 
tornado. The blast instantly doused the hot raging fire before her, 
leaving behind damp remains of wooden crates and boxes charred in the 
fire. As the flames died down she instantly drew back her arms, 
turning around and dashing for other fires to put out. 

Kazuki smiled generously as he watched this girl go to work with her 
magic. &#147;Aoi...&#148; He started. &#147;I think we&#146;ve found the girl.&#148;
