<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch31.html">Back to Part 31</a><pre>Kris, Natalie, Kai, Tanya and Cherilyn burst into the Eastern Dorms and 
quickly moved across the lobby when a girl ran towards them, &quot;What are 
you doing here?&quot; The girl demanded, &quot;Westerns are not supposed to be in 
he-&quot;

&quot;Shut up&quot; Natalie snapped at the girl causing her to jump.

&quot;This is not good.&quot; Kris remarked as she scanned the many girls that had 
gathered for lunch, &quot;We need to find them before someone gets hurt.&quot; She 
turned to Tanya, &quot;Tanya, where is she?&quot;

&quot;Up stairs.&quot; Tanya pointed to the stairs, &quot;Third floor washroom in the 
far corner.&quot; 

&quot;You can not be serious?&quot; Kris stared at Tanya in disbelief, &quot;The 
washroom May killed herself in?&quot; 

&quot;I didn&#39;t think about it until afterwards.&quot; Tanya explained uneasily, &quot;I 
figured she just wanted to use the washroom. I didn&#39;t think something 
bad would happen.&quot; 

&quot;Did something happen to Jenn?&quot; One of the Eastern girls inquired 
nervously. 

&quot;We hope not.&quot; Natalie stated as she pushed passed the girl, &quot;We need to 
get to her before one of her memories do.&quot; She exclaimed as she headed 
for the stairs. 

&quot;I hope she&#39;s alright.&quot; Cherilyn remarked as she followed the others 
towards the stairs. 

&quot;I hope so too.&quot; Tanya worried, &quot;I hope so too...&quot;   

They climbed the dorm stairs in a flash; Kris was the first to reach the 
washroom to find it locked. She took no time hesitating as she slammed 
her shoulder into the door, breaking the lock and forcing herself into 
the room. The group stumbled into the washroom to find it empty. The 
mirrors were unbroken and there was no sign of the struggle that had 
just ensued. 

&quot;Jenn?!?&quot; Kris called out as she opened each stall door in search of her 
friend. 

&quot;Where could she have gone?&quot; Natalie inquired, &quot;The door locks from the 
inside so she has to be here somewhere.&quot; 

Kai hurried passed Natalie to examine the mirrors. She gingerly touched 
one of them and quickly pulled away as if the mirror was on fire. She 
spun around to face her sister, &quot;Carey was here...&quot; She stated with 
uneasy. 

&quot;Carey!!&quot; Kris exclaimed, her worry suddenly turned to fear, &quot;No... Not 
her...&quot;
