~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The contemporary kunoichi stood upright and looked from one side 
of her location to the other. It was a long corridor. That 
stretched from a fifty metre long path to a tall slide-door at 
the other side of the way. Hibuki had told her that following 
corridors would eventually lead her to Hirotsugu&#39;s main place of 
operation. A place in the shrine called the Room of Fates. So 
she ran down that corridor as quickly as possible. She had to 
get to Hirotsugu fast. And she bounded across that long stretch, 
slid open the door and the end, and moved onwards. The process 
she repeated with every corridor and following room she came to. 
She worked her way deep into the halls and passageways of the 
Shinrin Jinja, not stopping a single second to catch her breath 
or soak up the Pre-Modern vibe of the place. Eventually she came 
to a newer section of the shrine. One that was at first marked 
by the gigantic hall that Shiki found herself in. She bust open 
the door that led inside it. And stopped as she came to a whole 
new section of the shrine. This room in particular was 
different. It was a lot larger. Almost 90x90 metres in size. A 
training room. Kendo sticks were mounted on the walls on one 
side of the hall. On the other were a chain of open air windows 
that poured fresh light into the room. 

But the difference in the size of design wasn&#39;t the only thing 
that bothered her.

This place felt so... familiar...

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

&quot;...You&#39;re going to be very strong... I am going to make... sure 
of it...&quot; 

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Shiki&#39;s sweltering eyes narrowed as she looked around this 
place. She felt the greatest pang of nostalgia when she looked 
at it. But that was absurd. She&#39;d never been here before in her 
life. Why would this place have a... familiar feel to it? 
Whatever the reason; Shiki ignored those  palpable inklings 
inside that were nagging at her. Just in time to notice that she 
was not alone in this room. Shiki&#39;s green eyes focused on a new 
issue as they rolled over to the far side of this large training 
hall. Across from her at a great distance was the Wind Shinobi 
of the Six Orochi himself. Kugure Setsuki. With a rose in one 
hand and an unsheathed katana (named Utsukushii, or &#39;Beautiful&#39;) 
in the other. Shiki anticipated that she&#39;d run into one of the 
Orochi before she managed to kill Hirotsugu. Setsuki was not the 
Orochi she had been expecting. In all truth... she was expecting 
Yagami. But Setsuki, with a charming smile on his face and 
holding the rose to his nose to smell the fragrant aroma, spoke 
his piece first. 

&quot;Once I saw you defeat Zanmaru-san,&quot; The slightly older youth 
started off, &quot;I knew that one day we would have to face each 
other. I have said it once and I will say it again. You are as 
deadly as you are beautiful. But even the brightest of stars 
must suffer the overwhelming presence of night. And yet I would 
rather not see your exquisite star swallowed up in the darkness. 
Such a mixture of beauty and death must never go to waste. 
Especially not by my sword. Will you not end this futile battle? 
Surely you realize that a fight against the Honshu Koga is a 
fight that cannot be won?&quot; 

Shiki had forgotten how much of a poetic romantic this guy was. 
&quot;Sorry. But I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m not afraid to take a stand 
against him. I don&#39;t care if I have to die to stop him. Because 
I know that to let him live... would be turning my back on 
Japan. On the nation that spawned me and my power. His 
corruption festers in this country like a virus. Him and the 
other three Koga will bring nothing but calamity. But even more 
than that... Hirotsugu-yarou is my prey. My target. All shinobi 
exist as are tools for assassination. Consequently, I&#39;m simply 
carrying out my duties as a ninja. Those responsibilities are to 
kill him and kill anyone else who gets in my way. And right 
now... that includes you.&quot;

Setsuki smiled, shutting his eyes. &quot;...I also knew that you 
would be headstrong from the very first moment we met. My glass 
heart is always drawn to intensity and passion. Even if my eyes 
cannot quite see it from the surface. But I am also bound to my 
obligations as the third of the Six Orochi. As you say... we are 
nothing but weapons in the face of those to whom we pledge our 
allegiance. My master&#39;s wish is simple. The death of the one who 
opposes him. Such a pity. Such a waste of a beautiful life.&quot;

It was comments like that that made Shiki wonder why this guy 
thought she was the one about to die here. But no matter. She 
had to get past Setsuki as quickly as possible so that she could 
finish off the Honshu Koga. The Wind Shinobi grasped Utsukushii 
in a two-handed grip and then held downwards diagonally from his 
waist. Shiki&#39;s eyes widened in realization of that. That was the 
Kazehashisei (Wind Blade Stance). She remembered that a 
swordsman  she had been fighting a few years back had used that 
against her. It stuck heavily in her mind because contemporary 
shinobi who still used the long blade as a weapon were scarce. 
But from the hakama and that headband... Setsuki appeared to be 
a master of it. That was a little interesting. But Shiki didn&#39;t 
have much time to think that over. Setsuki swerved Utsukushii 
into a horizontal grip at his side and ran straight for Shiki in 
a frontal assault. A seemingly odd move to make. Shiki leaned 
forwards and reached down to her right shuriken pouch with her 
right hand. The girl stuck her hand in it and pulled out one of 
Genryukai&#39;s new, swifter batch of shuriken. She then threw it 
straight at the charging Setsuki. The dark-haired swordfighter 
looked up at the swirling shuriken. One that moved faster than 
most customary ones. Probably due to a better design. Setsuki 
growled and slashed to the right, batting the metal death star 
out of the way. The star struck the floorboard ground with a 
small clattering sound; while Setsuki continued to charge ahead. 

&quot;Shuriken are worthless against me!&quot; He yelled, mid-charge. 

By now they were too close to each other for Shiki to dodge so 
she brought out Miyuki from the sheath strapped to her back 
waist. Two potent blades of steel clashed against each other. 
The thinner, sleeker Miyuki against the longer, thicker 
Utsukushii. The clap from the clash rang in the ears of both 
shinobi. As they battled to outdo the other in a sword lock. 
Which made Shiki realize that she was not going to be able to 
out-blade this guy. Setsuki forced all of his weight into the 
sword lock. Shiki grunted and pushed her foot back to keep 
herself braced against the floor. The Wind Shinobi was 
reasonably strong for someone who looked so thin and lithe. 
Strong enough to win sword locks like this one. Shiki didn&#39;t 
back down from it. But something had to give. Her sandaled feet 
began sliding backwards. There was little traction that could be 
gathered over the floorboards of this room. Before she even knew 
it; her back was pressed up against the back wall of the 
training hall. Shiki had forgotten how close she was to it. 
Setsuki leered over her, sporting a distant and romantic smile. 

&quot;...You know...&quot; His voice sounded strained. Which was no 
surprise since he was still trying to overpower the Miyuki short 
sword, &quot;...Your demeanour is enormously attractive... when you 
make an effort in defeating someone...&quot;

Something a bit inappropriate to say in a heated battle. But not 
as inappropriate as Setsuki&#39;s following action. Shiki&#39;s 
mistrusting green eyes glazed over in pure astonishment as 
Setsuki pressed his full, feminine lips against the outline of 
own; bound by the facial wrappings over her mouth and chin. The 
wrappings were thin. So Shiki could feel the kiss almost as 
clearly as she would have done if she didn&#39;t have them on. She 
blushed a deep crimson and was so stunned by this that she 
actually lessened the pressure on Miyuki. For an abrupt moment 
of confusion; Shiki remained stoic. Just feeling the ever so 
slight force and heat of Setsuki upon her lips. This quick 
moment faded and she regained her senses after it. Shiki widened 
her eyes and drew one leg up to her chest. Then kicked with a 
powerful thrust below Miyuki and Utsukushii, which were still 
locked together. Setsuki grunted and broke the kiss with the 
younger girl as her kick forced him backwards, striking him in 
the stomach. Once Shiki had gotten some distance between herself 
and Setsuki; she turned around and began running up the wall 
like she would a street. Once she got close to the top of the 
wall, she back-flipped off it; using its great foundations as a 
spring board for the action. Her torso writhed like demon in the 
air. And she landed down in a crouched position; behind Setsuki, 
who was now reassuming the Wind Blade Stance. 

Though the thin wrappings around her face securely hid her 
acerbic scowl, they could not hide her more than vivid blush. 
&quot;A-Are you out of your mind?!&quot;

&quot;...No,&quot; He replied with a smile, &quot;...I&#39;m just thrilled to be 
fighting someone as powerful and as beautiful as you. Like I 
told you beforehand, the amalgamation of beauty and death is a 
uncommon and astonishing quality. Pardon me for indulging myself 
in it before we conclude this fight.&quot;

Shiki had actually forgotten that the Third Orochi had a little 
thing for her. But she didn&#39;t want to drag this out. Hirotsugu 
was the issue now. Yet at the exact same time... Shiki was kind 
of reluctant to kill this guy. He might have had his head in the 
clouds but Setsuki was (outside of Uchida Hibuki) the only 
Orochi she had actually taken a shine to. Despite his flirty 
nature.  But whether or not Shiki wanted to step this up, it 
appeared that Setsuki was making that choice for her. Using one 
hand to make the two-fingered sign, the Wind Shinobi brought 
Utsukushii over his head. Shiki could feel him gathering that 
willowy Chi of his. 

&quot;Time for a Kaze-jutsu technique,&quot; Setsuki declared, &quot;Your great 
beauty deserves an even greater power. Thus I will use the best 
of all my abilities. If you can withstand this attack then 
nothing can stop you! My special technique! Tatsumaki Ten Shou 
Zan!&quot; 

Setsuki brutally slashed through the air, cutting downwards with 
a one-hand grip. And then brought it back up with the same 
ferocity as the one before it. A huge howling sound echoed out 
into the vast size of the training hall. The flowing length of 
Shiki&#39;s facial wrappings flocked behind her head. She covered 
her face as a gigantic wind awoke in the room from Setsuki&#39;s 
actions. Those seemingly unfocused currents of air gathered 
together before the poised Wind Shinobi. They circled around and 
around each other until they took on the shape of a miniature 
tornado. One that was so powerful it tore up the floorboards 
beneath it. The chunks and splinters were thrown into the air 
and danced around the conjured twister which was beginning to 
inch its way towards Shiki. The Burning Kunoichi blinked at the 
Tatsumaki Ten Shou Zan (Whirlwind Heaven Rising Slash). It was 
tall enough to touch upon the wood of the ceiling. And strong 
enough to tear that wood to shreds. In what way could a person 
fight something like that? Shiki growled under her breath (which 
was completely drowned out by the loudness of the Tatsumaki Ten 
Shou Zan) and reached within her left shuriken pouch. Shuriken 
would be useless against that compact tornado. But Setsuki had 
to be distracted by the conjuration of it and the focus needed 
to maintain it. She then threw one of her shuriken straight at 
the peak of the twister as it neared her.  The shuriken retained 
its sharp trajectory until it was sucked into the cluster of 
wind and hurled around inside it. 

Shiki then made the two-finger sign and took a deep breath. 
&quot;Damn. This isn&#39;t going to be easy. Shunhenkou!&quot; 

A puff of smoke surrounded her. When it vanished, the shuriken 
was left there, falling to the ground. And that put Shiki right 
in the centre of the twisting hurricane. From the outside, the 
waves of the wind were like knives. Sharp enough to cut and 
kill. But the weakness of a ninja conjured tornado was that the 
wind was a lot softer to handle on the inside. Which was why the 
ripped up planks of pine wood were simply tossed around and not 
chewed up. Shiki held herself as stern as she possibly could as 
she was thrown around the innards of the tornado. It was a risky 
move to make (one obvious reason was  that the Tatsumaki Ten 
Shou Zan was a vacuum and possessed no air; hence the previous 
deep breath) but she had no choice in the matter. It was the 
most unlikely place to attack Setsuki and therefore the best. 
The girl held her breath as best she could and made the sign 
once more. Then reached into her right pouch and hooked her 
fingers into three shuriken. She pulled her hand out of the 
pouch and then held them close to her face. If Setsuki could 
invoke the power of his spiritual element then so could Shiki. 
As they were held in her hand, the burst with three individual 
flames. Time for the San Shuri-Hou. Using all of her strength 
she threw out the three shuriken which all burst through the 
walls of the tornado, flaming. None of them were on target. But 
Shiki closed her eyes and focused all of her mental strength on 
each of them. 

&quot;Zanmaru-san left behind a legacy,&quot; Shiki thought to herself, 
struggling to hold her breath, &quot;The Art of Control... 
Kanri-jutsu...&quot; 

Setsuki watched all of the three shuriken from outside of the 
tornado. His eyes widened as all three of them began swerving 
around in the air and made a b-line for him. Then he looked into 
the whirlwind and saw Shiki. She was controlling them! The Art 
of Control&#39;s most basic skill, manipulating the route of 
projectile weaponry (like shuriken and kunai). Setsuki was far 
too confused to block them. So he acted on reflex. His body 
dodged the first one. Then the second one. But the third one was 
too quick and came from a completely different angle. Above. It 
sliced straight through his headband and the front of the outfit 
he happened to be wearing. It did no physical damage... but 
revealed something that Setsuki never wanted others to see. The 
Wind Shinobi&#39;s dark eyes widened with horror and almost 
immediately, the focus for the Tatsumaki Ten Shou Zan was lost. 
Setsuki lowered Utsukushii and shrank to the pine wood ground, 
gripping something at his chest together. Inside of the whirling 
miniature tornado; Shiki was running out of oxygen fast. But by 
that point it didn&#39;t matter. The winds of the attack were 
finally starting to subside. Setsuki&#39;s concentration had been 
broken and thus the control needed for the Tatsumaki Ten Shou 
Zan was gone. Shiki broke free of the rotating rhythm that had 
been made for her due to the tornado, and slowly began 
descending to the ground. Her sandals touched upon the pine of 
the floor again. And all the stray floorboard bark that had been 
tossed up into the air was falling back down again. Tumbling 
into the ground bit by bit. Shiki gripped her skull and sighed; 
her head had been rattled by the force of that twister. Then she 
looked over at Setsuki. And Shiki visibly gasped. Her facial 
expression beamed sheer astonishment at the sight. For a good 
reason. The headband at Setsuki&#39;s  head had been sliced off. 
Revealing a lush mane of ebony black hair that splashed upon the 
ankles in length. But that was the least of it. At Setsuki&#39;s 
chest was a healthy &#39;bounce&#39; that was suddenly brought to life. 
Something the Burning Kunoichi was not expecting...

...Breasts. 

&quot;...Y-You&#39;re...&quot; Shiki gave Setsuki a stunned glare, &quot;You&#39;re 
a... woman...? All this time you were really... a woman...?&quot;

Kugure Setsuki blushed and looked downwards, covering her 
exposed breasts as best as she could. The thing that had been 
cut were the wrappings that kept her breasts close to her chest 
and therefore hidden from view. They now rested in a shredded 
pile under her ankles, which blew Setsuki&#39;s deep secret straight 
from security. The young woman gave a hurt expression at 
herself, self-reprimanding... and at the same time... holding an 
embarrassment that should not have been as powerful or as frank 
as it was.

Setsuki&#39;s eyes lulled. But she couldn&#39;t say a word. &quot;...&quot;

The side of the Burning Kunoichi that was Hazumaru Yui was 
shocked. For the simple reason that she had been kissed by older 
woman in the same way that she had kissed Haruko. But the other 
part of her that was Shiki had more mature and important 
concerns. Like why Setsuki had masqueraded as a man. And also an 
even deeper question than that. Such as...why should she even 
care? Shiki looked down at the exposed woman, uttering,

&quot;...Come on! Don&#39;t you have anything to say?&quot;

She did, but they were not the words Shiki had expected to hear. 
&quot;...Kill me.&quot;

&quot;...What...?&quot; That wasn&#39;t an explanation of anything. And 
considering the fact that Setsuki was one of her enemies, that 
comment had a chilling ring to it, &quot;...Why are you asking me 
this? What is the matter with you?&quot;

Setsuki&#39;s shamed gaze didn&#39;t leave the floor. &quot;...A woman like 
myself can&#39;t hope to get the same respect as a male shinobi 
would. To the shinobi of this day and age... women are nothing 
but tools for pleasure and reproduction.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s crap. Ryoko-san was a girl and she was the First Orochi&quot; 
Shiki replied. 

&quot;...Ryoko-chan was unusually gifted. That was the only reason 
she was a member of the Six Orochi. Because of her great powers 
in Gensou-jutsu. But for me... life is much different. How would 
you react to a woman who loves women? It just wasn&#39;t feasible. 
Pretending to be male was the easy option and so I took it. The 
prestige given to me as an Orochi male was worth it. And I still 
got to express myself. Even if it meant donning a disguise I 
resent... and serving a man I cannot stand. But you&#39;ve taken 
away that guise. Thus I will surely be killed for my deceit. So 
you might as well take my life now. I would greatly prefer to 
die by the blade of a woman so beautiful... than to fall someone 
unworthy of my love.&quot; 

Shiki looked the slightly older woman up and down. Killing her 
would be easy. Just as it would have been easy to kill Hibuki. 
But she didn&#39;t. And look how well that turned out. Shiki shook 
her head at the Wind Shinobi and heaved a sigh. &quot;...I&#39;m not 
gonna kill you...&quot;

Setsuki at last looked back up after hearing this. &quot;W-Why 
not...?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you,&quot; Shiki replied, &quot;You&#39;re not in my way anymore 
either. I would be a coward if I were to strike you down now. 
Besides. You shouldn&#39;t be ashamed of what you are. My worth as a 
shinobi has nothing to do with my life as a woman. It doesn&#39;t 
change my resolve to kill Hirotsugu-yarou. Or my need to protect 
the ones I care about from his corruption.&quot;

Then Shiki began walking ahead. To the door that was on the 
other side of the room. The one that led deeper into the Shinrin 
Jinja. She strolled past Setsuki; who was still a bit 
shell-shocked from the revelation of her secret. But before 
Shiki left the room; Setsuki turned her neck slightly and looked 
over to the Burning Kunoichi. A smile was playing on her lips. 

&quot;This room is called the Room of Meeting,&quot; She spoke, &quot;The next 
room along is called the Room of Present. You will face 
Yagami-san of the Kagayaku Family when you get there. Beyond 
that room is the Room of Fates. And in there... you will find 
the Honshu Koga.&quot;

Shiki looked back at her, winking. &quot;Thanks. Setsuki-san.&quot;
