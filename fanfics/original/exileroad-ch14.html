<a href="../original/exileroad-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Swords clanged together as they swept in, weapons
flashing. Back and forth they fought, moving almost
faster than they eye could see, then suddenly the
black clad figure stiffened in surprise... before
collapsing bonelessly to the ground.

&quot;Damn&#39;t,&quot; Midori cursed softly as the black haired
woman shook the blood from her sword, &quot;I wanted to
take him alive.&quot; The warrior slid the sword back into
it&#39;s wooden sheath and twisted it slightly, once again
disguising it as a simple staff.

&quot;Nicely done,&quot; Jantha said dryly, the lovely blonde
standing not far away, guarded by the tawny haired
fighter nearby. She tried not to notice how attractive
she found Midori, lightly touched by sweat and a bit
breathless...

Laur&#39;ien nodded in agreement, &quot;Not bad at all.&quot; The
tawny haired woman kept one throwing knife in her
hand, a few others hidden beneath her clothes as she
looked around them warily and asked, &quot;Any more
coming?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t see more tha&#39; the two we defeated,&quot; Midori
said as she briskly headed to Jantha&#39;s side, &quot;I think
that&#39;s it for now.&quot;

Jantha raised a delicate eyebrow as they set off to
continue their trip to the palace, &quot;What do you mean,
for now?&quot;

Midori took on a faintly lecturing tone as she
explained, &quot;The Genin are very devoted to following
their code, part of which insists on just single or
paired assaults.&quot; Her eyes warily swept the crowds as
they walked along the rough stone road while she
explained, &quot;But as the funds devoted to a contract run
down, they&#39;ll throw greater numbers at us... assuming
the bastard who paid for the contract doesn&#39;t renew
it.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t be renewed,&quot; Laur&#39;ien surprised them all by
saying.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jantha looked curious.

Laur&#39;ien shrugged slightly, &quot;According to Commander
Hudson, anyway.&quot;

&quot;Seems the commander&#39;s been busy,&quot; Midori murmured
softly. She shook herself and went back to the topic,
&quot;The Genin will feel honor bound to complete the
contract... so as it runs out they&#39;ll throw greater
numbers of assassins at us.&quot;

Jantha nodded as one of the gate guards challenged her
and she produced her papers. The guards had been lax
until Midori had torn a strip off of them, pointing
out how bad it had been. One took it as a slight to
his honor and challenged Midori, a grave mistake. Just
using her staff against his sword Midori had beaten
him bloody, in the process guaranteeing that there
would be no more arguments over her suggestions.

&quot;Think we can take those kind of numbers?&quot; Laur&#39;ien
asked as they went through the courtyard and into the
castle itself.

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll just have to,&quot; Midori said flatly,
acknowledging another checkpoint. The halls were
packed with busy courtiers, men rushing between
offices with documents to sign or deliver, paperwork
the bane of any government.

Laur&#39;ien gave Jantha a mildly cross look and said, &quot;I
do wish we didn&#39;t have to keep running between your
home and the palace.. every time we do makes you a
target. Why not get a room in the Queen&#39;s suites?&quot;

Jantha frowned, &quot;To do so would be a giving in to my
foes.&quot; She gave Midori a sly look, &quot;A loss of face, as
the kingdom of Edo would say.&quot;

There was a oddly haunted look in Midori&#39;s eyes as she
agreed, &quot;Jantha has a point.&quot; She gave the Dutchess a
look, &quot;Besides, I think she&#39;s luring the Genin to
attack deliberately.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Laur&#39;ien blurted.

&quot;If we don&#39;t give them a chance at me they might
attempt an attack at my home,&quot; Jantha shrugged as they
reached the doors to the Queen&#39;s court, &quot;my maid and
servants could be hurt. If they attack us on the
street, we three are only at risk.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien opened her mouth to protest, thought about
it, then shut it again. &quot;Can&#39;t argue with that,&quot; she
admitted.

Jantha smirked, satisfied. Addressing the guard at the
door she asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

Knight Daniel nodded respectfully, &quot;M&#39;lady, the
ambassador from Xiang is speaking... and I fear it&#39;s
not going well.&quot; Respectfully he asked, &quot;Do you wish
me to announce you, Dutchess?&quot;

&quot;No, thank you,&quot; Jantha said as the three strode
inside.

Midori and Laur&#39;ien took point, pushing through the
mob so that Jantha could reach the front where a
figure paced back and forth, waving his arms. He was a
slim man, brown hair slicked back and clothes fine yet
somehow shabby on him. The word that irresistibly came
to mind looking at him was weasel, mostly due to his
pointed face and beady eyes.

&quot;The river lands have been ours for years,&quot; he waved
an arm, &quot;years I say...&quot;

&quot;You moved a encampment there three months ago,
Shinka&quot; Queen Gwen said dryly, the blonde looking
rather bored.

&quot;Our people have an ancestral claim to those lands,&quot;
Shinka swiftly switched tactics.

&quot;You mean,&quot; Richard noted from where the white haired
councilor stood nearby, &quot;your ancestors tried this,
too, and got defeated.&quot;

&quot;It was not a defeat,&quot; Shinka drew himself up straight
as he said, &quot;we merely chose to... concede the ground
temporarily.&quot;

&quot;In the histories I read they ran with their tales
between their legs,&quot; Midori drawled just loud enough
to carry.

Shinka whirled to look at her with a glare, instantly
assessing her with a glance. &quot;Silence, peasant,&quot; he
scowled.

Queen Gwen hid her smile with a hand, bringing her
emotions under control. With her face suitably grave
she said, &quot;Ambassador, you have no right to speak to
my citizens like that... especially when they merely
speak the truth.&quot;

Shinka turned to look at Gwen, fighting to hide his
displeasure. &quot;So,&quot; he said flatly, &quot;you will not
return our lands to us?&quot;

&quot;They are not your lands,&quot; Gwen said firmly, &quot;and you
have no claim on them.&quot;

Shinka nodded stiffly, &quot;Then we have nothing more to
discuss.&quot; And with that he strode from the room, his
guard taking up position beside him.

Richard gave the queen a thoughtful look then turned
to address the court. &quot;The Queen is fatigued and will
be hearing no more requests today,&quot; he said and with
grumbles of disappointment lords and ladies began to
file out.

&quot;Do we...?&quot; Laur&#39;ien asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Jantha shook her head, &quot;we&#39;re here on a
summons.&quot;

Just then Richard saw then pushing forward through the
leaving courtiers and nodded welcome &quot;Thanks for
coming,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll take you to Gwen.&quot;

The table was piled with documents as they entered the
private chambers behind the throne room, the place
where much of the real work in running the kingdom was
done. Gwen looked up with a smile of welcome, but her
expression was worried. &quot;Welcome, cousin,&quot; she nodded.

Once the greetings were over Jantha demanded, &quot;What&#39;s
going on?&quot;

&quot;The King of Xiang is an even greater fool than I
thought,&quot; Gwen said wryly.

&quot;You warned me a few days ago he might move, but...,&quot;
Jantha looked surprised.

Richard nodded as he sat, &quot;He&#39;s moved faster than
anyone expected.&quot;

&quot;So this king has moved his men into the river plain?&quot;
Midori murmured as she listened, &quot;A bold move.&quot;

&quot;Or a stupid one,&quot; Laur&#39;ien whispered back, &quot;unless he
has far more men than we think.&quot;

&quot;Depends on his objective,&quot; Midori shrugged, her
expression thoughtful.

&quot;You know, my best generals came up with much the same
analysis,&quot; Gwen said loudly, having overheard. She
looked to Jantha, &quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a obviously provocative move,&quot; Jantha shrugged,
&quot;he wants a war. But why?&quot;

&quot;From what I&#39;ve heard he tends to think with his..
lower parts,&quot; Gwen grimaced with distaste. &quot;He may
honestly believe a woman won&#39;t have the nerve to face
him.&quot;

&quot;If so,&quot; Richard smiled grimly, &quot;he&#39;s in for a great
surprise.&quot;</pre>
