<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 9 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Saturday, 2.00, Rose hill mall

It had been one whole week after that furious battle with the former 
Dark-General, Demon-Tanzanite. Things had been quite quiet after that. 
No demon attacks, or any demon scares, but there were other problems 
to consider&#133; Yai&#146;s power for one. Alana and Yai were at the Rose hill 
mall, in on one of the various clothing stores in there. Yai was 
exited about it and for once, she wasn&#146;t as love struck and Keiya 
crazy as had been recently. The Chestnut-haired girl held a shimmering 
emerald dress up to her shoulders, and motioned for Alana&#146;s verdict on 
how it looked on her. Alana only nodded in approval, eliciting a 
bright smile from the Chestnut haired girl, and Yai quickly walked 
away to buy it. Alana thought to herself for a second.

&#147;Hmm. She seems to be perfectly normal. Yai is not acting any 
differently then she usually does. But what is saw in her, that day, 
when she first used that awesome attack against Demon-Tanzanite&#133; it 
was like Yai was&#133; a whole new person. Not like the Yai I know&#133; it was 
like her powers had taken control of her. I know I did some research 
into that kind of power using the books of Tarn, but all I saw were 
shredded pages about the something called the Sacred Crest and some 
kind of&#133; clan, the Seiyunzuki clan. Could Yai have some kind of 
connection to that? And if she does, what will this power mean? I know 
I should talk to Yai about this, but I don&#146;t want to worry her about 
something that could be nothing.&#148;

Alana still continued to think to herself, until Yai stepped behind 
her and lightly tapped the blonde&#146;s shoulder. 

&#147;What&#146;s with you? You&#146;ve been acting really spaced out lately Alana.&#148;  
Yai said, with the dress she bought just a minute ago. Alana looked at 
Yai confusedly, but shook it off and smiled.

&#147;I&#146;m alright. Just contemplating a few things.&#148; Alana then smirked 
amusedly, and leaned back on the wall she was next to.

&#147;But hey, what about you? You&#146;re not with Keiya today huh? What&#146;s 
wrong, did you two have a fight?&#148;

Yai frowned and stuck her tongue out at the grinning blonde.

&#147;Keiya and I are perfectly fine thank you very much! And besides, we 
don&#146;t spend all our time together you know.&#148;

Yai was right the two didn&#146;t spend a great deal of time together; at 
least not alone. Alana knew this was because Keiya didn&#146;t want to 
reveal anything about the two of them right now. Although she didn&#146;t 
agree, Alana could sympathize with the Lilac-haired girl&#146;s attitude. 
And she knew that Keiya would open up as soon as she felt she was 
ready. Alana then put her arm around Yai and drew her into a friendly 
hug.

&#147;She will be ready someday you know.&#148; Alana consoled.  

Yai sighed to herself, not really registering Alana&#146;s statement for a 
while.

&#147;I know she will be ready&#133; I know but&#133;&#148; Yai trailed off.

&#147;You don&#146;t want to have to wait any longer?&#148;

Yai nodded. &#147;Right. I love her but we always have to keep it a secret. 
And I&#146;m tired of that. I want the world to know how I feel about 
Keiya. It&#146;s not like this sort of thing isn&#146;t common, and I know all 
our friends will stand by us if they know how much we love each other, 
just like you did Alana&#133; I just wish Keiya could see that&#133;&#148;

Alana smiled at her friend&#146;s optimism. Some would have called it na&iuml;ve 
thinking, but Alana knew better. It was all a part of Yai&#146;s charm.

&#147;You just have to hope I&#146;m afraid. Keiya will come around in time.&#148;

&#147;Yeah&#133;&#148; Yai then grinned, and looked up at Alana when she added, 
&#147;besides, forget about me&#133; what about you&#133;?&#148;  

Alana looked confused. &#147;What about me?&#148;

Yai&#146;s grin widened, and she moved out of Alana&#146;s embrace to look out 
of the window of the clothes store.

&#147;We need to get you a boyfriend Alana Hiramu&#133;&#148;

Alana&#146;s eyes bugged out, and a fiery blush stomped across the blonde&#146;s 
face. A boyfriend? For her&#133;?

&#147;Umm, Yai I don&#146;t think&#133; I mean&#133; I am not sure about&#133; me&#133; and a&#133; a 
guy&#133; not right now&#133; I think&#133; I mean I&#133;&#148;

Yai smirked at Alana. Her uncharacteristic stammering only hardened 
the resolve to set her up. She knew that Alana was really awkward 
around guys, but that wouldn&#146;t stop Yai from finding a guy for her 
best friend.

&#147;Don&#146;t you worry Alana, I am the queen of matchin&#146; people up! You&#146;ll 
have a guy by the end of the day, or my name isn&#146;t Yai Kitana!&#148;

Alana exhaled at Yai&#146;s forthrightness. It wasn&#146;t that she didn&#146;t want 
someone special to hold her; it was just that&#133;

&#147;Yai I don&#146;t think that&#133;&#148; Before Alana could finish talking, Yai 
quickly grabbed her hand, and led her out the store. Alana could only 
sigh helplessly as she was dragged towards a crowd of men&#133;

**********

Meanwhile, in the depths of the Negative Dimension orbital space 
fortress, a maniacal laugh echoed in its long ivory statue filled 
halls. The laugh belonged to Garnet, one of the four (now three) 
Generals of Queen Asumasa&#146;s court. The young woman was ecstatic about 
Tanzanite&#146;s demise. She had been waiting for this moment forever, and 
now that it was finally here, she couldn&#146;t contain herself.

&#147;Finally!&#148; Garnet thought. &#147;Finally Tanzanite is out of my way. You 
weakling&#133; you deserved to die. I still can&#146;t believe her highness 
entrusted such an important mission to you. Well now that you&#146;re dead 
and berried, I can continue the little work that you did.&#148;

Just as Garnet stopped speaking, the red crystal across from her shone 
brightly, making some extremely strange sounds. Garnet only smiled, 
tossing her blood red hair behind her with a jerk of her neck, and 
walked over to it. Garnet pressed the jewel, and the jewel turned a 
light blue, and Garnet smiled even brighter, as a voice made itself 
known from the jewel.

&#147;Greetings Garnet.&#148; 

Garnet bowed before the jewel, even though no one could see her.

&#147;Greetings your highness, what have I done that warrants your presence 
in the Negative Dimension?&#148;

Queen Asumasa spoke, after a very delayed wait. &#147;I had heard from 
Amethyst and Zirconia that Tanzanite has been killed. Is this true?&#148;

Garnet grinned at memory of her rival&#146;s destruction, but kept her 
shifty voice quite humble, as not to offend Asumasa&#146;s concern. 

&#147;Yes my Queen. I don&#146;t know how, but Tanzanite must have gotten the 
idea that you were prepared to kill him if he didn&#146;t bring you the 
Talismans soon, so he ended up making some grave mistakes.&#148;

Asumasa voice darkened. &#147;You don&#146;t think that this has something to do 
with the power of the Starsoldiers?&#148;

&#147;Well, partially your majesty. Tanzanite invoked the forbidden arts 
simply to defeat those little gnats. He toyed with powers that he 
could not fully grasp and he died for it. That&#146;s what it all comes 
down to.&#148;

&#147;He did a fusion? Are you serious?&#148;  

Garnet stood up. &#147;Uh huh. I&#146;m afraid so my Queen.&#148;

&#147;Well then maybe I misjudged his powers. Never mind, he was always 
expendable. I am relying on you Garnet.&#148;

Garnet saluted, even though Asumasa still could not see her. The 
Crimson-haired vixen was incredibly devoted to Queen Asumasa, no 
matter what happened. That was also partly why she really wanted 
Tanzanite out of her way. Garnet was only happy to be the apple of the 
Queen&#146;s eye, and by heading the mission of the Lunatic Andromeda&#146;s 
succession, no one would be able to take her place&#133;

&#147;You can count on me your highness. I wont let you down.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure that you wont. By the way, how goes our mission?&#148;

Garnet brought her hand to her chin and thought to herself.  
     
&#147;Well we have two of the Talismans already, and we know the location 
of one of the others. However, I&#146;ve come to believe that those vile 
Starsoldiers may have the final one.&#148;

&#147;What about our human energy supplies?&#148;

&#147;Well Tanzanite actually did gain quite a bit of human energy for us. 
Around 75% of the amount we need for the Deadstar. All I need to do is 
gather up the other 25% and transport the full amount to you. That 
should take no more than a day or so.&#148;

&#147;Very good Garnet. I should have entrusted you with this mission from 
the beginning.&#148;

&#147;Yes, you should have.&#148; Garnet thought.

&#147;It&#146;s my pleasure your highness. I serve only to please you.&#148;
  
&#147;Okay. I see you have everything under control. Report back to me when 
you have made more progress.&#148;

&#147;Yes my Queen.&#148;

Asumasa seemed as if she were about to leave, when she said something 
else to her Crimson-haired general. 

&#147;Oh and Garnet?&#148;

&#147;Yes, Queen Asumasa?&#148; Garnet asked.

&#147;The Starsoldier who destroyed Tanzanite&#133; the one called Lovestar&#133;&#148;

 &#147;Yes&#133;&#148; Garnet trailed off.

&#147;Do what you want with the other Starsoldiers, but her&#133; bring her back 
to me at Zone Tower, and bring her back&#133; alive.&#148;

Garnet looked shocked. Allow someone as powerful as that girl to enter 
the court? Asumasa must be joking.

&#147;But your highness!&#148; Garnet spluttered, &#147;Why bring that Starsoldier to 
the Tower? I mean wouldn&#146;t we be better off killing someone with that 
kind of power?&#148;

There was an under tone of anger in the Queen&#146;s voice as she replied 
to Garnet.

&#147;Yours is not to question me Garnet. Yours is to do as I say and bring 
me the rest of the Talismans for the Lunatic Andromeda. Understood?&#148;

&#147;Yes my Queen.&#148;

Garnet sighed. She didn&#146;t want Asumasa to be angry with her. But she 
also didn&#146;t see the need to bring Lovestar to Zone Tower. Garnet 
pressed the jewel to it return it to its normal red configuration. 
Garnet walked away from it, but froze as she heard something rustle 
behind her. Garnet turned around to see Wong-Lao, the mercenary that 
was hired by Tanzanite to search for the Talismans. Garnet grunted at 
his presence. She didn&#146;t trust people who had such amorphous loyalties 
as a mercenary. Wong-Lao ignored the bout of rudeness, and spoke to 
the Crimson-haired woman regardless.

&#147;You lap dog.&#148; Wong-Lao said.

Garnet&#146;s eyes flared at Wong-Lao&#146;s remark, and walked straight up to 
him, with a look of anger that did not suit her beauty.

&#147;What did you say to me?&#148; Garnet said angrily, her fist already 
clenching&#133;

&#147;You heard me. Not only are you a subservient dog but you&#146;re also a 
liar. You told Tanzanite that Asumasa would kill him if he didn&#146;t pull 
his act together didn&#146;t you?&#148;

Garnet sneered for a second, temporarily forgetting about her anger by 
remembering her handiwork.

&#147;Heh. It was his own fault for being stupid enough to believe me about 
that. Now he is out of the way, there will be no need for your 
services.&#148;

Wong-Lao crossed his arms and leaned back into the wall. Garnet was a 
coward, but what she did have, was plenty of cunning.

&#147;I don&#146;t think you&#146;ll be getting rid of me that easily.&#148;

&#147;And why would that be?&#148; Garnet hissed.

&#147;Because if you want to find the third Talisman and keep your Queen 
happy, you need to know its location. And the only one who knows its 
location, is me&#133;&#148;

Normally she would have destroyed someone as arrogant and as 
discourteous as Wong-Lao was, but he did have a point. Tanzanite was 
dead, and only he and this mercenary knew the location of the third 
Talisman. Garnet&#146;s fist shook at her side in her frustration&#133;

Keneda high school, 2.35    

Keiya was sitting down at a bench just beside the running track the 
back of Keneda high. Gently tapping the sole of her shoe, she looked 
out at the track team and smiled. She had been given the position of 
leader of the track team after Katsuhito&#146;s death at Yai&#146;s hands. She 
actually did enjoy it. It gave her a chance to experience things 
outside of her duty as a Starsoldier, and at school. And it also gave 
her quite a few responsibilities, and she commanded a lot of respect 
from the guys. Even though she didn&#146;t like having to practice on a 
Saturday, she was glad that she was now a part of something. Keiya 
stood up, and walked over to the team. While walking she noticed a new 
guy. He seemed unique somehow&#133; he wasn&#146;t particularly bulky, he was 
actually quite weedy in his appearance, with thin limbs and such pale 
skin&#133; but at the same time&#133; Keiya felt something from him&#133; Keiya 
stopped and greeted the team.

&#147;Hey guys.&#148; Keiya pointed to the boy. &#147;Who&#146;s the new guy?&#148;

One of the track team members walked up behind the boy and introduced 
him.

&#147;This Keiya; is Shokei Kizuno. Shokei, this is Keiya Shindo, the 
leader of the team, and one of the cutest girls in school.&#148;

Keiya blushed at the comment, and shook Shokei&#146;s hand.

&#147;Nice to meet you Shokei.&#148;

Shokei gave Keiya an icy look. Keiya suddenly felt awkward about this 
guy. It wasn&#146;t about the way he looked or his hand shake, it was 
simply this weird feeling she got from him&#133; somehow she got the 
feeling that this guy could be a problem&#133; before she let her thoughts 
get too carried away, she let go of the boy&#146;s hand. Keiya gave him a 
strange, questioning look, but Shokei only smiled at her.

&#147;So I hear from the rest of the your track team that you&#146;re extremely 
capable runner Keiya&#133; might I have a chance to test this out for 
myself?&#148; Shokei said. 

Keiya still looked at him questioningly, but answered him all the 
same.

&#147;Uh&#133; sure&#133; how about right now?&#148; Keiya suggested.

Shokei smiled again. &#147;That&#146;d be fine.&#148;

The two of them walked over to track, and knelt in position for the 
run. The coach then yelled out for the two of them to go, and Keiya 
and Shokei zoomed off. The two started with Keiya in the lead by a 
small distance, with Shokei behind her. Keiya held back a bit, she 
didn&#146;t want to humiliate the boy, but as she chose to do that, Shokei 
pushed ahead of her, looking back enough to fire another ominous smile 
at her. Even though she was a humble soul, she didn&#146;t like it at all 
when people toyed with her, and ran even harder after Shokei. After 
narrowing him down, Keiya advanced and slipped past the finish line. 
Keiya then kneeled down on the floor and caught her breath. She had 
never expected to get a challenge from Shokei&#133; she actually had to 
almost go all out to beat him&#133; Shokei walked up, not panting or 
breathing heavily, fairly calm and conserved&#133;

&#147;That was a good race. The stories about your speed were not 
exaggerated. I just hope we can do it again.&#148;

Shokei smiled, and walked back over to the team, who were shocked 
about the amount of trouble, he gave Keiya. The Lilac-haired girl only 
looked at the young man. There was something that just was not right 
about him&#133;

Golden Dragon Training Dojo, 3.15

&#147;Raine!&#148;

The pony tailed redhead walked over to the heavily banged dark-haired 
girl, clutching at her waist. The two of them were in the living room 
in their apartment over the dojo. Raine had stood up and tried to walk 
over to her dark-haired companion, but it only made her worry. Krista 
rushed over to her friend and put her arms around the redhead&#146;s waist, 
and led her to the couch. Raine gently sat down, being careful not to 
aggravate the damage done to her by Demon-Tanzanite, when she was 
fighting him as Firestar. Krista sat next to Raine. Although she would 
never admit it, she cared about the redhead a great deal. Which is why 
she didn&#146;t want to see her up and about. She knew that Raine was tough 
and that her healing powers would repair the damage soon, but she 
didn&#146;t like the idea of Raine not resting.

&#147;Why aren&#146;t you in bed Raine?&#148; 

Krista asked, allowing her gaze to travel to the door. Raine only 
stared at the ground, ignoring the concern in Krista&#146;s voice. She 
didn&#146;t like it when Krista worried over her unnecessarily. 

&#147;Stop fussing over me. I&#146;m not a invalid.&#148;

&#147;I am not fussing over you. I just need to make sure that you are 
okay.&#148; 

Raine looked over at Krista apologetically. 

&#147;Sorry.&#148; Raine said. &#147;I don&#146;t mean to make you feel bad I just&#133;&#148;

Krista nodded. To a certain extent, she could understand how Raine 
felt. She wasn&#146;t the type that allowed herself to be rescued or 
protected by others.

&#147;It&#146;s okay. Why did you get up anyway?&#148;

Raine looked seriously at Krista.

&#147;We need to talk about the others.&#148; The redhead said.

Krista only replied to Raine&#146;s request by giving her a confused look, 
but that look transformed into realization. Krista then looked away. 
The violet-eyed girl knew exactly what Raine was talking about but she 
just didn&#146;t like it&#133; 

&#147;Krista&#133;&#148; Raine said exhaustedly. &#147;We can&#146;t do this alone.&#148;

Krista then immediately looked back at redhead.

&#147;Does that ultimately mean that we have to merge with those weaklings? 
You said it yourself, we don&#146;t know anything about them, and they 
already have a Talisman. What makes you think that they are deserving 
of our trust?&#148;

&#147;They saved our lives Krista! You know as well as I do that if we 
fought Tanzanite alone we would have been killed. I don&#146;t think we can 
hold out any longer then we have. We must join them.&#148;

Krista only grunted at Raine&#146;s comments. She knew that she Raine was 
right but she still did not like the idea of uniting with the other 
Starsoldiers: Lovestar, Waterstar and Sunstar.  

Raine held Krista&#146;s hand in her own, in an effort to calm her 
dark-haired friend down. Krista never really liked change.

&#147;It&#146;s the best course of action right now. We wont stop the Darkforce 
by ourselves. And besides you can&#146;t call them weak, at least not 
Lovestar. You know what we saw on the news today. Officials still have 
no clue as to what made that massive crater in the Northern Road Park, 
but we both know don&#146;t we? It was the girl&#146;s power Krista. Her power 
is enormous. We gotta make use of that.  Even if we don&#146;t join with 
them, we still need the Talisman that they have.  If it falls into the 
wrong hands, that&#146;s it. Game over. Is that what you want?&#148;

Krista, still not looking at Raine, stifled out an answer to Raine&#146;s 
question.

&#147;&#133;No.&#148;

&#147;So then why not? And don&#146;t tell me that they could be a threat 
because you know as well as I do that they seem to be nice people.&#148; 
Raine said. 

Krista looked up at Raine again. She did raise some good points. Raine 
could be extremely rational when she needed to be. The dark-haired 
seemed to have forgotten this.

Krista smiled. &#147;You still seem to surprise me Raine Masami.&#148; 

Raine grinned in approval, letting go of Krista&#146;s hand and crossing 
her arms Guru style.

&#147;That&#146;s right. You better believe it!&#148;

Krista giggled at Raine. She liked it like this. The two of them 
having a quick little argument that would end up with the both of 
them, joking around. 

&#147;And anyway Krista, you can&#146;t say that that unions are a bad thing. 
Look at you and me. When my Grandpa invited you into the Dojo, you and 
me both had doubts. But we learned to put up with each other and now 
look where we are.&#148;

Krista nodded. That was true. Krista recalled first meeting Raine. It 
was at the martial arts tournament, the World Fighters Competition. 
Krista had entered the tournament to test out her skills, and train to 
become stronger. The Dark-haired remembered that at that point in her 
life, all she cared about was revenge&#133; revenge for the death of her 
father, and the only way that she saw to do that was to get stronger. 
Nothing else really seemed to interest her then. That was until she 
entered that tournament though&#133; Krista remembered how she smashed all 
of her challengers, with little or no effort. And how she strolled 
through the preliminaries, constantly surprising the judges. Even the 
semi-finals were a breeze for her, and in no time at all, she was up 
against Raine. Raine had also had a fairly easy time in getting to the 
finals, and it was considered to be one of the two of them who would 
win the match. Krista and Raine then fought each other, for the most 
part; giving it their all. And the two reached an unmistakable 
equilibrium. Neither could defeat the other but neither was prepared 
to yield a single step either. After about an hour of dead lock, 
Krista was really thinking about getting serious with Raine, but 
before she could, a Demon-monster attacked the arena. Raine 
transformed into Firestar, and fought the demon, but was eventually 
beaten. Then Krista wasted no more time, and transformed into 
Earthstar. With a little effort and time, Earthstar managed to finish 
off the demon. Krista then took Raine back to her home, to the Golden 
Dragon Training Dojo to recuperate.  Krista then explained everything 
to Raine&#146;s grandfather, and the wise old man requested that she stay 
with the two of them and join forces. Both Krista and Raine were very 
reluctant to unite, but Krista accepted, realizing that her father 
would have wanted her to join up with them. Although things didn&#146;t run 
smoothly, Raine and Krista came to like each other, then care about 
each other greatly. 

Raine was right though, unification brought more strength, it didn&#146;t 
reduce it. Krista exhaled at the realization, and closed her eyes.

&#147;Alright. You sold me. Lets join up with them.&#148;

Raine smiled in approval, happy to have changed her best friend&#146;s 
thinking, but frowned when she thought of something else.

&#147;Now lets just hope that they wanna join with us&#133;&#148;

Neo-Tokyo shopping arcade, 4.50

Hovering just above the masses and masses of people who where shopping 
and looking around, a solitary figure stood. Garnet smirked at the 
humans. Oblivious&#133; uncoordinated and foul, but they would soon be 
extinguished though, as long as things went to plan, the earth would 
belong to the Darkforce&#133;

Garnet snorted again, and shook thoughts about the spineless humans 
out of her head as she raised her hand into the air, with one swift 
swipe. The Crimson-haired general then mumbled an ancient chant to 
herself, and watched in delight as the people down below her began to 
pass out and collapse in the dozens. Each and every one on the arcade 
slowly fainted, dropping their newly bought possessions onto the cold 
hard floor. Garnet pushed both of her arms down then, and focused her 
power onto one spot. It then cracked open a small portal, and Garnet 
raised her hand into the air once more, saying that chant again, this 
one very similar to the one that Tanzanite used, only this time it 
served a different purpose. The bodies that were now laid out across 
the arcade began to shake violently, not under their own control but 
under that of the chant.  The dozens of human bodies twisted and 
convulsed because of the chant, and rays of shimmering blue light flew 
out of each of them, shooting straight towards the miniature portal 
that Garnet created. Each blast was sucked into the void, and more and 
more poured into it from other parts of the city. Garnet laughed 
wildly at the scene before her&#133;

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!! Now you puny earthlings! You will be 
put to real use, for her highness Queen Asumasa! Nothing can stop me 
now! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!!!&#148;

Meanwhile at Northern Road Park, the Demon mercenary Wong-Lao was 
looking for the third Talisman, in his Demon form. He had come here 
before but was stopped by Waterstar and Lovestar. Tanzanite then ended 
up searching for the final one at Keneda high school, but he ran into 
the two other Starsoldiers, Earthstar and Firestar. Wong-Lao was sure 
that if he had not have been interrupted but Waterstar and Lovestar 
that he could have found the third Talisman. 

Wong-Lao had dug deep into the earth, in the middle of the gigantic 
crater that was left by Lovestar&#146;s Gates of Eternity attack. For a 
minute, Wong-Lao took a second to look around and survey the damage 
done to the park. 

&#147;The amount of power it must have taken to make a crater like this&#133; 
what are we dealing with&#133; these Starsoldiers are way too powerful to 
be just Starsoldiers&#133; this is unlike anything I&#146;ve ever experienced 
before&#133; unreal&#133;&#148;

Wong-Lao continued to dig at the ground, deeper and deeper, until he 
hit a hard stop. The mercenary smashed his fist into the earth around 
it, and raked it up with his claws. Taking a quick look at the ancient 
artifact, a silver quarter circle, shinning and clear, despite the 
mounds of dirt on it, and quickly put it in his pocket. Wong-Lao 
smiled. He would be paid handsomely for this heist. Before he forgot 
his plan though, he teleported out of the Northern Road Park, to the 
shopping arcade. Wong-Lao grimaced the amount of human bodies that lay 
across the whole arcade. But his was not to question, only to obey 
orders. Wong-Lao then sat down, and waited for the Starsoldiers to 
arrive&#133;

**********

Yai and Alana were pacing down the halls of the Rose hill mall, 
desperately trying to reach the area at which they sensed a black 
power&#133;it was horrible&#133; for the first time, the sensing Demon power 
ability had chilled her to bone. Yai and Alana jetted down the stairs, 
and exited the mall. Yai gasped as she saw dozens of lifeless, 
soulless bodies strewn across the shopping arcade&#133; Alana stepped 
forwards, looking around her and shaking her head, a look of disgust 
plastered on her face.  Yai&#146;s face paled considerably, and she began 
to shake violently&#133;

&#147;This is&#133;awful&#133; how could they&#133; do something like this? I know what 
they are capable of but&#133; but this&#133;&#148;

Alana looked over to Yai. She seemed extremely disturbed by this. The 
blonde walked over to her best friend, and clasped her shoulders, 
trying to shake the terrified Yai out of her hysteria.

&#147;Hey Yai&#133; you alright? Listen to me Yai, pull yourself together! You 
need to be strong for me okay? You need to be strong!&#148;

Yai slowly glared at the blonde. What she was saying was right but&#133; 
she had never seen anything like this before. It made her stomach 
churn to see the butchery of the Darkforce&#133;

Yai clenched her fist for a second, in an effort to control herself, 
and looked directly at Alana.

&#147;I-I will.&#148; Yai said bravely.

&#147;Now lets transform, and kill whatsoever it was that did this okay?&#148;

Yai only nodded, her eyes darkening at the thought of that which did 
this. It wasn&#146;t Tanzanite, but if it were prepared to kill all these 
innocent people then she would take great pleasure in destroying it&#133;

&#147;Lovestar power&#133; transform!!!&#148;

&#147;Sunstar power&#133; transform!!!&#148;

A bright flash of light sprang across the entire shopping arcade, as 
Yai Kitana and Alana Hiramu transformed into Lovestar and Sunstar, the 
Magic Starsoldiers. The two were then about to go out and look for the 
one who did this, but stopped when a figure teleported in front of 
them. Lovestar looked closely at the creature&#133; dark purple skin, 
shredded trousers, a massive ivory horn coming out from the back of 
his head&#133; 

Lovestar realized who it was&#133; &#147;Wong-Lao!&#148;

Wong-Lao smiled as he crossed his arms, looking between Lovestar and 
Sunstar.

&#147;I am flattered. You remembered me.&#148; The mercenary looked over to 
Sunstar. &#147;I don&#146;t believe we&#146;ve met.&#148;

Sunstar chose not to say anything to that. &#147;Did you do this?&#148;

&#147;No. But I do know who did it. And she ordered me to take care of you, 
my little dolls&#133;&#148;

Lovestar clenched her fist, so tightly that her knuckles were losing 
their color. She had no patience for this at all. She wanted to 
demolish the monster that did this, even if it destroyed her&#133;

&#147;You will tell me who did this immediately!&#148; Lovestar shouted.

&#147;Nope, I don&#146;t think so&#133;&#148;

Lovestar couldn&#146;t contain her rage anymore&#133; they would pay for this&#133; 
even if it took her an eternity&#133; they would pay&#133;

&#147;Then I&#146;ll blast the truth out off you!!! Crushing Love Blast!!!&#148;

Wong-Lao and Sunstar gasped as Lovestar&#146;s golden energy wave blew out 
of her hands and flew towards Won-Lao. The mercenary quickly leapt 
into the air to avoid the attack, and it when careening into a nearby 
wall, blowing the whole thing up. Lovestar would have normally felt 
bad about blowing up public property like that, buts she was far too 
mad to care. Lovestar was about to jump into the air to chase after 
the Demon, but before she could, Wong-Lao smiled at her, and flung a 
strange energy disc at the Goddess of love and peace. She would have 
at least attempted to avoid it, but it was simply too quick for her. 
The disc split open and wrapped itself around Lovestar&#146;s neck, 
freezing her in place.     

Wong-Lao landed next to Lovestar, reaching out the Goddess of love and 
peace, and clasped her comatose body. 

&#147;Heh, heh. If you want her back, bring me the Talisman you have in 
three hours. Meet me at the Northern Road Park&#133; see you soon&#133;&#148; 

Sunstar&#146;s eyes widened and she ran straight for her best friend, 
lunging at the two of them, and went straight through their 
silhouettes. The blonde crashed into the stone ground, sliding past 
one of the dead bodies that were drained of its life energy. Sunstar 
looked around for the two of them, darting and searching with 
attentive eyes, but it was in vain&#133; they were gone&#133;

&#147;&#133; Yai&#133;&#148;

**********

&#147;No!!&#148;

Keiya grasped Alana&#146;s shoulders, shaking the blonde genius repeatedly, 
to try and get the real story out of her. This couldn&#146;t be happening! 
Yai couldn&#146;t, wouldn&#146;t leave her! The two of them were at Keiya&#146;s 
house and Alana was giving her the news. Needless to say, Keiya wasn&#146;t 
taking it well at all&#133;

&#147;What do you mean she&#146;s gone?! That can&#146;t be!! I trusted you with her, 
how the hell could you let that happen Alana!!&#148;

Keiya was yelling furiously. She knew this was not Alana&#146;s fault but 
she was too distraught to care about that. It was taking everything 
she had to hold back her tears, which threatened to spill over.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry&#133; I tried to stop him Keiya&#133;&#148; Alana said, her head bowed in 
shame. She also knew it wasn&#146;t her fault but she couldn&#146;t help but 
feel responsible. Yai was still a beginner despite her power, and it 
was Alana and Keiya&#146;s duty to watch over her.  

Keiya wiped the tears out of her eyes. &#147;Don&#146;t be sorry. We&#146;re going to 
find Wong-Lao, kill him, and bring Yai back.&#148;

&#147;But what about the Talisman?&#148; Alana asked.

Keiya contemplated that for a second. Neither of them really knew what 
the Talismans would do in the Darkforce&#146;s hands, but that didn&#146;t 
matter to Keiya at all. All that mattered was Yai. Keiya stood up off 
of her bed, and walked over to the desk beside the window. She pulled 
out the Talisman, and walked a back over to Alana.

&#147;We wont let them get it Alana. We will find a way to keep the 
Talisman and get Yai back. You ready?&#148;

Alana looked up at Keiya and smiled. &#147;Yes.&#148;

The Northern Road Park, 7.48

Waterstar and Sunstar arrived at the Northern Road Park, waiting for 
Wong-Lao&#146;s return. Waterstar looked around the place. The crater that 
Lovestar had left in it was subject to a great deal of media 
attention. It had been cordoned off with police wire, but that didn&#146;t 
stop the two Starsoldiers from getting in. Waterstar had never liked 
this place. Not since the day she first fought Wong-Lao, and Lovestar 
got hurt. And it still had that foul stench. The smell of Tanzanite&#146;s 
charred flesh that had been there since his death.

It had been three hours, but still no sign of Wong-Lao or Yai. 
Waterstar was beginning to seethe with irritation, until she and 
Sunstar had heard something behind them. The two swung around at the 
sound, but eased gently when they saw whom they were. It was Earthstar 
and Firestar. Sunstar automatically inspected the two of them. 
Earthstar had seemed to recover from her injuries well, but Firestar 
still looked worn out. 

&#147;Hello.&#148; Firestar said, keeping her face neutral. She didn&#146;t want to 
make it seem like she was desperate to join them, but at the same 
time, she also didn&#146;t want to push them away.

&#147;Earthstar, Firestar&#133;&#148; Sunstar said.

Waterstar frowned at them. She was not in the mood for the other two 
Starsoldiers right now. She did not know whether it was Yai&#146;s kidnap 
or her own misery, but she had absolutely no patience for their 
arrogance today&#133;

&#147;What do you two want?&#148; Waterstar hissed.

Earthstar ignored the hostility in Waterstar&#146;s voice and walked up to 
the two of them.

&#147;We came to help.&#148; She said, looking at Sunstar, who nodded back. 

Waterstar&#146;s eyes narrowed at them. Lovestar saved their lives, nearly 
killing herself in the process, and they didn&#146;t even thank her. Now 
they come here as if nothing happened and offer their support?

&#147;Forget it. We didn&#146;t ask for your help. You told us to stay out of 
your battles, well stay the hell out of ours.&#148;

Earthstar suddenly became angry. &#147;Now wait a minu&#133;&#148;

Sunstar put a hand on Earthstar&#146;s shoulder to cut her off, just before 
anything got started between them. The Goddess of Knowledge then 
gently held Waterstar&#146;s hand to reassure her. She could understand 
Waterstar&#146;s attitude, but she could not let it get the better of her.

&#147;I know how you are feeling Waterstar, but you must try and keep calm. 
We could use their help.&#148;

Waterstar reluctantly nodded, but not before shooting Earthstar and 
Firestar a portentous glare. Firestar sighed and looked up and around 
the crater that had been left here in the park. While doing so, she 
caught sight of something in the distance. Hovering above the four 
Starsoldiers were Garnet and Wong-Lao.

&#147;Look!&#148;

Earthstar, Waterstar and Sunstar looked up into the sky as Firestar 
yelled out and pointed to that area. Waterstar instantly felt a rage 
burn in her as she watched Wong-Lao&#133; so smug and cocky, and it only 
added to her anger when she did not see Lovestar with them. 

&#147;Where the hell is Lovestar?!&#148; Waterstar almost screamed, not 
concentrating on anything besides her love&#146;s safety.

Garnet pointed to the four of them. &#147;First the Talisman, then the 
girl.&#148;

&#147;We wont give you anything until we know that she is okay.&#148; Sunstar 
said calmly, trying at least to maintain her disposition. 

Won-Lao smirked at them. &#147;Heh, heh. We&#146;re calling the shots around 
here&#133;&#148; 

If there was a string that was holding all of Waterstar&#146;s hatred and 
anger back then it must have snapped there and then, because the 
Goddess&#146;s fury erupted at Wong-Lao&#146;s indignity.

&#147;Crystal Frozen Fra&#133;&#148; 

Before Waterstar could call out her attack, one of Wong-Lao&#146;s energy 
disks zoomed forward and ensnared her neck, instantly freezing the 
woman in place. Sunstar run over to Waterstar to help her, but fell to 
the ground as a second disk caught her neck also. Firestar and 
Earthstar were also about to attack, but become immobile as two more 
energy disks hit them. All four of the star soldiers collapsed to the 
ground, and Garnet preformed a second chant. Four beams of light then 
instantly enveloped them, and in no time at all, they were all 
transported away. Garnet laughed in her victory, and she sensed that 
one of the girls had the final Talisman. Wong-Lao only frowned at her&#133;

&#147;You better make sure you get me my energy crystals, Garnet.&#148;

The Crimson-haired general just smiled, not looking at the mercenary. 

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, you&#146;ll get paid&#133;&#148;

Wong-Lao snorted at her, and teleported away from the park. Garnet 
just continued laugh&#133;

&#147;Heh, heh, heh&#133; welcome to the Deadstar, girls&#133;&#148;
