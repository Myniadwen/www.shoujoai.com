<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Sarah got to her feet as the train slowed to a stop and gave her friends 
a nervous smile, &quot;Well, that was not to hard.&quot; She gave her sisters&#39; 
hands and helped them to thier feet.

&quot;If you insist...&quot; Amber shook her head. 

Sarah glanced out the window to see a long train station platform 
outside &quot;Looks like we&#39;re here.&quot; She said with a stretch, &quot;Looks like an 
ordinary station to me.&quot; 

&quot;If you remove the creepy forest and strange building on the top of that 
hill, maybe.&quot; Amber stated, still looking out the window recalling the 
landscape she caught a glimpse of before pulling into the station. For 
the most part Sarah was correct; Whispering Hills did appear to be an 
ordinary little town. From the train they could see a sparse clutter of 
houses mixed amongst the colour of many trees. However the forest left 
an unsettling feeling in her stomach that was only doubled when Sarah 
pointed out the unusual old building at the top of the hill that was 
surrounded by the forest and spiralling dark clouds. She could not get 
that place out of her head and Sarah needed to nudge her twice to get 
the girl&#39;s attention. 

&quot;Are you coming or what?&quot; Sarah inquired as she dropped the girl&#39;s 
duffle bag onto her lap. 

Amber let out a fake pained sound as the bag landed heavily upon her, 
&quot;I&#39;m coming already.&quot; She said as she got to her feet and hauled her bag 
over her shoulder, &quot;You don&#39;t have to be in such a rush.&quot; 

Caitlin struggled with her own bags on the other side of the train. 

&quot;You need a hand with that?&quot; Amber offered reaching up for the bag and 
helping untangle the handles from a post.

Sarah placed her hands on the girls&#39; shoulders and urged them down the 
hall, &quot;I don&#39;t want to miss our stop. Who knows where this train is 
going next.&quot; 

Amber suddenly realized what her sister was implying and hurried on her 
way, &quot;I don&#39;t want to know.&quot;

&quot;Me neither.&quot; Caitlin agreed as they descended the back stairs and 
headed for the door. 

Amber stepped out onto the flat cement platform and glanced around. The 
station looked no different then the one they had just left and part of 
her thought they maybe they never left their home afterwards. Her 
thoughts quickly vanished when she turned to see a tall thin girl with 
short spiky hair walking her way, the girl&#39;s raised in the beginnings of 
a wave and then she stopped, as if she noticed something. Amber stared 
at the girl curiously and took a small step closer. Her eyes widening in 
disbelief as she realized who it was that she was looking at. It 
couldn&#39;t be possible, could it? How did Jessica know she was coming? Did 
she actually send the letters? The surprised look upon Jessica&#39;s face 
said otherwise, she appeared to be as thrown by Amber&#39;s appearance as 
Amber was by Jessica. 

&quot;J... Jessie?!?&quot; Amber finally managed to sputter as she slowly shook 
her head, &quot;It can&#39;t be...&quot; 

Amber?&quot; Jessica breathed in awe, &quot;How? When?&quot; 

&quot;Amber you are in the way!!&quot; Sarah stated as she pushed passed her 
sister with Caitlin, &quot;What is wrong with you lately?&quot; She asked as she 
glared from Amber to the new girl and back, her eyes darting back to 
Jessica in astonishment, &quot;Jessica?!?&quot; Sarah called out in confusion. 

A tall woman in a dark business suit, white cloak and short shimmering 
black hair stepped onto the platform and approached Jessica&#39;s side, 
&quot;Jessica I would like you to meet your newest arrivals, Amber Gaites, 
Sarah Richards, Caitlin Rogers and...&quot; She introduced as she gestured 
from one girl to the other and looking around as if in search of one 
other, &quot;Were their not four girls aboard the train?&quot; 

The girls shook their head, &quot;Just us.&quot; Sarah assured.

The woman blinked and a look of concern crossed her face, which quickly 
disappeared and was replaced by a warm smile, &quot;Well then ladies, let me 
introduce myself. I am the head of Whispering Hills Academy, Sophia, and 
this young lady is the head of the Academy&#39;s Western Dorm, Jessica 
Wright. We would like to welcome you to the Academy and hope you enjoy 
your stay.&quot; 

Amber dropped her duffle bag to the ground as she stumbled towards 
Jessica. Everything felt washed out and dream like. She had thought 
about this day for years and now that it was finally happening and she 
was lost for words, only able to stare at the girl who left her so many 
years ago. 

Sarah snapped her fingers in front of Amber&#39;s face, &quot;You alright there 
Amber?&quot; She inquired softly. 

&quot;Pinch me... this has to be a dream.&quot; Amber said in a dazed voice. 

Sarah did as her sister requested and pinched her on the arm, hard. 

&quot;Ouch!!!&quot; Amber cried out, &quot;I wasn&#39;t serious.&quot; 

&quot;Well, now you know it isn&#39;t a dream.&quot; Sarah remarked with a grin and 
patted the girl on the shoulder, &quot;Here is your chance. Don&#39;t you want to 
talk to her?&quot; She encouraged with a sly grin.

Amber leaned in close to Sarah and whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t know what to 
say.&quot; 

&quot;Ask her where the hell she has been.&quot; Sarah suggested in a low hush, 
keeping an eye on Jessica, to make sure she did not come closer just 
yet, &quot;Ask her why she ran off on us. Why she left us at that house all 
on our own.&quot; There was an edge of anger on Sarah&#39;s voice that startled 
Amber. 

Amber glanced up at her sister, &quot;Your still angry with her, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

Sarah stepped back, &quot;No, I just think she has a lot of explaining to do. 
Don&#39;t you agree Caitlin?&quot;

Caitlin rubbed her arms anxiously and shrugged. 

Amber turned back to Jessica, &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right about that.&quot; She 
walked over to Jessica, leaving her bag behind, and moved right up to 
the girl. 

&quot;Amber...&quot; Jessica smiled at the girl and spread her arms wide in 
anticipation of a hug. What she got startled her immensely as Amber 
punched her in the shoulder, &quot;Hey! What the hell was that for?&quot; Amber 
swung at the girl again only to have her hand caught this time by 
Jessica, &quot;Hey!&quot; Jessica shouted out, catching the girls other fist as 
she proceeded to try to pumble the girl, &quot;What is the matter with you?&quot; 

&quot;Me?!?&quot; Amber glared at Jessica furiously, she felt a confused mix of 
anger and sadness fill her heart. She had thought for sure that when she 
finally got to see Jessica again she would run into the girl&#39;s welcoming 
embrace and be drawn into a wonderful kiss. &quot;ME?!? What about you?&quot; She 
growled, &quot;You disappear without a word and don&#39;t even send a letter or 
anything telling me if you are alright. I thought you were living off 
the streets or dead and here I find you health and happy without me. Why 
shouldn&#39;t I be angry?&quot; She inquired coldly. 

Jessica flinched at the girl&#39;s words, they stung her heart, taking 
chunks out of it, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She lowered her head in shame, &quot;I 
don&#39;t have a good explanations for you.&quot;

Sophia stepped forward and placed a hand upon Amber&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You 
should not place your anger on Jessica.&quot; She said in a calming voice, 
&quot;She is not to blame.&quot; 

Sarah rushed to her sister&#39;s side, with Caitlin right behind her 
carrying both their duffle bags, &quot;She has a right to be angry.&quot; She 
stated boldly, &quot;Who are you tell her she can&#39;t be angry?&quot; 

Sophia glanced over at Sarah, &quot;The reason you shouldn&#39;t blame your 
friend is because when I found her she had very little of her memories 
from her past. She had been living off the streets and was near death 
when she arrived at our school. We gave her a new life and it was 
through that new life that she was able to remember the two of you, 
which is how you came to be here today.&quot; 

Sarah shook her head in disbelief, &quot;Are you trying to tell me that we 
were invited here because Jessica remembered us?&quot; 

&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Sophia paused in thought, &quot;It is more of a coincidence 
that her recollection came at the same time as your invites. It might be 
that the Lords could not see you before Jessica stumbled into your 
dreams and that in turn brought you here. Tell me, would you have 
followed those tickets if Jessica had not appeared in your dreams?&quot; 

Amber looked up at the Head Mistress in astonishment, &quot;How did you know 
we saw Jessie in our dreams?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

Sophia simply smiled, &quot;You will find I know a lot of things.&quot; She 
answered modestly. 

Jessica raised a hand to the girls, &quot;Trust me, you don&#39;t want to know.&quot; 

Sarah crossed her arms and glared at Sophia, &quot;If that is so, then tell 
us where are April, Penny and Kimberly?&quot; 

&quot;You will find Kimberly and Penny awaiting you at the Dorms.&quot; Sophia 
stated and frowned slightly as she glanced around the platform yet 
again, &quot;Are you certain that April was not on the train with you?&quot; 

&quot;No, we only found Caitlin.&quot; Amber insisted, &quot;Why was she supposed to be 
on the train?&quot;

Sophia closed her eyes lightly as if in deep thought; &quot;I feel her here, 
but I don&#39;t know where.&quot; She said sadly. 

Amber blinked in shock, &quot;She is here then?&quot; She glanced at Sarah, &quot;We&#39;re 
actually be able to see them all again.&quot; 

Sarah gave her sister a peculiar smile, &quot;It looks that way.&quot; 

Jessica glanced up at Sophia, &quot;She isn&#39;t in the Woods is she?&quot; Recalling 
one of the ways students arrived in the school, &quot;Or did she come through 
the pool, or a mirror?&quot;

Sophia shook her head, &quot;No... she is with someone else at the Academy. 
We should hurry if we want to find her.&quot;  

&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell us twice.&quot; Sarah exclaimed, swinging her bag 
over her shoulder, &quot;What is this academy anyway?&quot;
