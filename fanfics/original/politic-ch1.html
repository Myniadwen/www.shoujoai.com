<h1>Politically (in)Correct as Always (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Once upon a time two women lived together in both love and friendship.

Both were soul mates, yet were also as different as night and day.

One was an Asian woman of so-so height and strong stature. Her hair was 
short and raven black, her eyes dark and piercing, her face strong yet 
beautiful. She wore the black uniform of her status as a Judgment well, 
as well as her cursed katana blade which was slung over her back.

Her name was Keiko Yamanaka, the 7th Judgment. Originally born on the 
dream continent of Nippon, she wandered the Grimmlands (the dream 
continent of Germany, named after the Brothers Grimm) dispensing 
judgment upon both creatures of light and dark.

The other was a European woman of tall height and soft-spoken nature. 
Her hair was blonde and flowed down her back, her eyes soft and light 
blue, her face gentle and stunning to behold. She wore the white 
uniform of her status as a SpellThrasher well, as well as her headset 
gear which pumped tunes into her mind which helped her &quot;thrash&quot; spells 
through the beat of the music. Her name was Eve, she would not speak of 
her last name, and she was a SpellThrasher. A native born of the 
Grimmlands she wandered the continent with her beloved Keiko, working 
with her to do right and protect the innocent.

It was on this strange day that the two stumbled onto a young woman, 
named Red Riding Hood, who lived with her mother on the edge of the 
Greymalkin Woods. On that day--

&quot;My mother asked me to take a basket of fresh fruit and mineral water 
to my loving, nurturing matriarchal grandmother.&quot; Red announced with 
straight face and honest intent.

Keiko stared at her as if she couldn&#39;t quite believe what the girl was 
saying, Eve simply smiled her warm gentle smile and said nothing.

Red went on to say, &quot;I&#39;m doing this not because it&#39;s womyn&#39;s work, but 
because the deed was generous and helped engender a feeling of 
community. Furthermore, grandmother is not sick, but rather in full 
physical and mental health and quite capable of taking care of herself 
as a mature and responsible adult.&quot;

The look of utter befuddlement did not leave Keiko&#39;s face for a single 
moment. &quot;Womyn?&quot; she muttered, looking at Red as if she just grew a 
rather inappropriate sexual organ right in front of her face. &quot;You hail 
from your own private home world, don&#39;t you. (Just staring at you makes 
me want to close my &#39;hailing frequencies&#39;.)&quot;

Red, undaunted by Keiko&#39;s confused words, set off with her basket 
through the woods, with the two following close behind. Why? Because 
the woods she set through was believed to be a dangerous place to 
wander. And, in truth, a few Darklings have been sighted there in the 
past few days which is why Keiko found herself in those woods that day. 
This girl, however, seemed to just prance in without any concern to her 
own health or well-being.

At this protest, however, Red simply shrugged and replied that she was 
confident enough in her own budding sexuality that such obvious 
Freudian imagery did not intimidate her.

That left Keiko even more baffled.

&quot;Remind me to be not be concerned when the &#39;obvious Freudian imagery&#39; 
starts to feast on her intestines as if they were spaghetti.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she knows these woods better than us?&quot; Eve offered, to which 
Keiko replied &quot;Or she&#39;s the worst kind of nutter this continent has 
ever produced. Either way we better stick close to her.&quot;

On the way to Grandmother&#39;s house, Red was accosted by a Greymalkian, 
from which these woods were named. The Greymalkian race was a species 
of wolf slash humanoids which were rather peaceful in demeanor, and 
tended to be shy towards non-Greymalkians. This one, however, was 
overcome with curiosity which is why he came so close to Red, with an 
inquiry about the contents of her basket clinging to his lips as he 
spoke to her.

&quot;Some healthful snacks for my grandmother, who is certainly capable of 
taking care of herself as a mature adult.&quot;

The Greymalkian glanced warily at Keiko, who only shrugged and said 
&quot;Don&#39;t ask. She must be getting too much of a good thing.&quot; (Waving her 
free hand about to note the fresh air around them and how it must be 
damaging Red&#39;s mental capacity).

The Greymalkian shrugged, taking the briefest moment to sniff the air 
(just in case it was as dangerous in large quantities as Keiko said) 
before speaking, &quot;Darklings showed up in the woods two days ago, this 
isn&#39;t a safe place for a young woman to walk alone. It&#39;s a good 
thing--&quot;

Red&#39;s eyes narrowed as she huffed her breath, her head rising slightly 
in indignation, &quot;I find your sexist remark offensive in the extreme, 
but I will ignore it--&quot;

The Greymalkian and Keiko exchange glances again, Keiko merely 
shrugging, &quot;At least she&#39;s talking to you.&quot;

&quot;--The stress of which has caused you to develop your own, entirely 
valid, worldview. Now, if you&#39;ll excuse me, I must be on my way.&quot;

Silence followed her as she walked off leaving the three to stand there 
confused.

A cold wind blew across the scene.

&quot;Did she -- insult me?&quot; the wolf asked, to which Keiko replied &quot;I think 
she insulted you.&quot; to which the Greymalkian muttered, &quot;How can you 
tell?&quot;

The three parted company, Keiko hurrying to catch up to the girl with 
Eve close behind, while the wolf went a different way. Red, a slave to 
rout and discipline, wandered the main path to Grandma&#39;s, but because 
the Greymalkian was more of a free thinker and a bit of a know-it-all 
about the woods, it quickly took the fastest route to the only house he 
knew of which contained a human. He burst into the house and -- 
stopped.

-----

&quot;I think she was dropped on her head as an infant.&quot; Keiko muttered, the 
two finally catching up to Red. &quot;Explains her brain-dead speech.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s just very educated and quite informed -- for someone of her age, 
that&#39;s quite an accomplishment if I do say so myself.&quot;

Keiko, however, wasn&#39;t buying it. &quot;She&#39;s an accomplished pain, that&#39;s 
what she is! Snooty girl! She thinks she&#39;s better than us!&quot;

&quot;She didn&#39;t say that--&quot;

&quot;EVE!&quot; Keiko spat out, eyes narrowing, &quot;She speaks at us like we&#39;re 
mindless! She babbles on about stuff that only she seems to care about, 
and she has a smarter-than-thou attitude. She&#39;s a total bitch -- hate 
to see the kind of woman she&#39;ll turn in -- what?&quot; (noticing Eve&#39;s 
smirking face) &quot;You said bitch.&quot; Eve noted, pointing at Keiko who 
smiled at the remark, &quot;Sorry. My bad.&quot; (silence) &quot;How much longer do we 
have to walk? This is boring!&quot;

True enough it took four hours (with stops and breaks and Keiko&#39;s 
endless nagging) to get to Grandma&#39;s. Even Eve&#39;s tireless banter and 
calming nature couldn&#39;t keep Keiko from taking an endless strings of 
potshots at Red, all of which seemingly flew over the girl&#39;s head as 
she ignored the 7th Judgment and walked on without replying. This, of 
course, solicited a string of comments from Keiko as to how Red&#39;s head 
was as dense as Tritanium Armor, but that also got no reply.

Finally the trio reached the cottage and Red entered, saying &quot;Grandma, 
I have bought you some fat-free, sodium-free snacks to salute you in 
your role of a wise and nurturing matriarch.&quot;

At this Keiko pushed Red aside, grabbed the basket, and whistled, &quot;YO! 
GRANNY! GRINDS!! Get your bad self in here and let&#39;s pound down this 
stuff -- got any cheese? Your grand-daughter&#39;s an idiot! (What kind of 
dolt brings crackers but no cheese?!?)&quot;

Suddenly Keiko stopped, her hand passing the basket back as her other 
reached for her blade, her teeth clenched as she glanced nervously at 
Eve, &quot;We&#39;re not alone.&quot;

She quietly snuck up to the bed, grabbed the sheets, and pulled them 
open blade held high.

From the bed, the Greymalkian said softly, &quot;I can&#39;t move -- oh god I 
can&#39;t move -- I feel so floaty. Is this heaven?&quot;

Red stared at the wolf and said, &quot;Grandma, what big eyes you have!&quot;

The wolf and Keiko stared at Red intensely. &quot;Speaking of eyes, you must 
be blind as a major league umpire.&quot; Keiko muttered, her patience with 
Red finally gone. Suddenly her attention went right back to the 
Greymalkian. &quot;Why are you in Granny&#39;s bed? You didn&#39;t-- oh god you 
did.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t know I knew her granny until -- oh we&#39;ve been friends for 
years now but -- goddess I&#39;ve seen so much today -- so much -- and 
experienced more -- goddess I&#39;m in love!! I never thought me -- and her 
-- we were friends but -- I can&#39;t live--&quot;

Keiko gulped hard, sweat forming on her brow. &quot;Your not -- oh what am I 
saying, you are--&quot; At this Red remarked, without missing a beat, 
&quot;Grandma, what a big nose you have --&quot;

Keiko turns back to Red, eyes narrowed, but Red continued to speak 
ignoring her &quot;--only relatively, of course, and certainly attractive in 
its own way.&quot;

&quot;Rape is far too good for you.&quot; Keiko hissed, patience gone. Eve simply 
patted Keiko on the back whispering to her as their attention went back 
to the Greymalkian who was now grinning a big silly grin. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think her smell will ever leave me. I don&#39;t want it to leave me. I want 
to smell her on me forever. It&#39;s so beautiful I think just from 
remembering it&#39;s sweet soft fragrance I&#39;m going to--&quot;

&quot;OH-KAY!!&quot; Keiko blurted out, stopping his thought in mid-sentence, &quot;I 
get the point.&quot;

Red, same calm expression nodded, &quot;Yes. Grandmother does smell good 
enough to--&quot;

Keiko rudely interrupted her before she continued, Keiko&#39;s features 
drooping as she took on a look of utter shock, which quickly reformed 
into her usual deadpan expression &quot;--can I kill Red? If you&#39;re not 
going to eat her I want to do the deed, if only to shut her up.&quot; Keiko 
groused in an irritated manner.

&quot;Grandma, what big teeth you--&quot;

&quot;ALL THE BETTER TO RIP YOUR THROAT OUT, YOU SIMPERING LITTLE FREAK!!&quot; 
Keiko screeched, bringing the room into total silence. Eve, her face 
still calm, walked Keiko to a chair as the wolf checked his now 
perfectly normal teeth. &quot;God I hope it&#39;s still not big. The dentist was 
expensive but it&#39;ll all be worth it because she said I could give her 
oral pleasure and--&quot;

&quot;AGGHHH!!&quot; Keiko screamed, hands covering her ears and head dropped in 
pain, to which the Greymalkian replied honestly &quot;I am quite happy with 
who I am and what I am. And I&#39;m in love with Ms. Hood, thank you very 
-- are you crying?&quot;

Keiko, tears flowing down her face, suddenly jumps out of her chair 
intent on decapitating Red, the person she blamed for her &quot;problems&quot; 
right now. Red screamed, and it took quite abit of effort on Eve&#39;s part 
to &quot;stop&quot; Keiko with a &quot;jamming&quot; spell which froze Keiko in place. The 
effort? Wasted since Keiko was endlessly strong and had no &quot;ceiling&quot; to 
hit stamina wise. The spell was only a stopgap to hold her, even as she 
was in the motion to bring her blade about to swipe Red&#39;s head from her 
shoulders.

Seconds later a huge man carrying an ax burst into the house, stopped, 
and sighed. &quot;Oops. Sorry, I--&quot;

&quot;And just what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Red hissed, no longer paying 
attention to the Judgment behind her who was trying to kill her. 
&quot;Bursting in here like a Neanderthal, trusting your weapon to do your 
thinking for you!&quot;

&quot;But -- that woman&#39;s trying to--&quot;

&quot;Sexist! Speciesist! How dare you assume that womyn and wolves can&#39;t 
solve their own problems without a man&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!!&quot;

All eyes turned to Keiko who had finally struggled free of the spell, 
rushing up to get right into Red&#39;s face as Eve falls back a few steps 
shocked by Keiko&#39;s breaking loose of the spell. &quot;FIRST OFF IT&#39;S WOMAN, 
NOT WOMYN!! (What are you, part Wyrm Dragon?!?) Second , if I ever see 
you again after I walk out of this house it&#39;d be far too soon, then I&#39;d 
have to KILL YOU!! Third, you make me sick you freak of nature you! 
Fourth, BRING CHEESE!! Crackers suck without cheese! Five, did I 
remember to mention that I hate you, you freak, you! Six--&quot;

&quot;Hi, Keiko.&quot;

All eyes turned again towards the bathroom door, where a beautiful 
30-ish woman stood (bare naked). Keiko sighed, pouted, and nodded her 
head. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you.&quot;

&quot;What &quot;Oh, it&#39;s you&quot;, after so long? I&#39;d have expected better.&quot;

Eve and Red looked on in confusion. Understand, the woman explained. 
&quot;Keiko here beat me down once when I was a crazed old broad cursing 
people. She got me fixed up, rehab and here I am all cured and no 
longer evil. She can be nice when she wants to be--&quot;

Keiko flips the bird at Ms. Hood, to which she mutters, &quot;She just 
doesn&#39;t want to be nice right now it seems.&quot;

&quot;Bite me.&quot;

She smiled at Keiko, turning to lay down next to the Greymalkian, and 
favor him with her smiling face as they embraced lovingly, &quot;We&#39;ve 
decided to become mates for life.&quot;

Keiko mumbled under her lips, and made quick motions with her free hand 
as if mocking them.

Eve didn&#39;t understand, so Ms. Hood explained, &quot;Keiko doesn&#39;t like 
happily ever afters between men and women, she&#39;s not too into men as 
you noticed.&quot;

&quot;I noticed.&quot; Eve nodded, glancing over at her companion who wasn&#39;t done 
mocking Ms. Hood, to which Eve replied &quot;She&#39;ll get over it though, she 
always does.&quot;

Ms. Hood nodded, speaking as she did &quot;Well, today&#39;s the first day of 
the rest of our lives --&quot; (smiling as she hugged the Greymalkian) 
&quot;--so this is an anniversary of sorts, and--&quot;

Keiko&#39;s grim features suddenly slid, and became more grim -- but for an 
entirely different reason. Her teeth clenched, eyes widened, and a look 
of utter shock came over her suddenly, &quot;OH NO!!&quot; Keiko yelled. Eve, at 
first, didn&#39;t understand, but then it dawned on her. &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right. 
It&#39;s our anniversary--&quot;

&quot;Yesterday.&quot; Keiko muttered in defeat, &quot;It was yesterday.&quot; she 
repeated, her head drooping back down.

-----

Clearly Keiko wasn&#39;t having a good day.

It didn&#39;t help her when they ran into the Darklings they were hunting 
right after departing Granny&#39;s place. Keiko, in turn, was not in the 
mood for banter with them.

She tore through them in a far more brutal manner than any wolf could 
tear through any human.

She was clearly NOT in her happy place.

Nothing Eve could do would make Keiko any happier. Once she realized 
she had forgotten their anniversary she had become a sullen thing that 
just dragged herself along with her head dropped low. &quot;I don&#39;t mind. 
It&#39;s only one year after all.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s one whole year &#39;til the next one--&quot; Keiko muttered, head still 
drooped.

Little did they know that they were nearing another trouble spot that 
needed fixing.

Once there were three little pigs -- well, little is hardly the word 
since they were about 4 foot something and taller than the average pig. 
They lived together in mutual respect and in harmony with nature -- or 
maybe they just lived together because there was strength in numbers?

Using materials found in the areas they each liked, they each built a 
beautiful home -- or, to be more precise, conned others to build for 
them.

One pig, who lived in a wide field of straw, lived in a house of straw.

One pig, who lived in the woods, lived in a house of sticks.

And one pig, who lived in a valley, lived in a house of bricks made 
from natural materials.

But this story isn&#39;t about the pigs, it&#39;s about the rather distressed 
wolf that crossed Keiko&#39;s path.

The wolf, miffed and quite angry, came storming onto the road talking 
to itself. Keiko for her part ignored it, still dragging herself along, 
but Eve took a moment to listen to it.

&quot;Do that to my wife will they? I&#39;ll show them! Pigs can&#39;t treat a woman 
in such a -- a --&quot; (wolf suddenly grounds to a halt, nearly causing 
Keiko to walk right into it in her downer mood) &quot;--?--&quot;

&quot;In a piggish manner?&quot; Eve offered, to which the wolf nodded &quot;Yeah! 
That&#39;s it! Pigs shouldn&#39;t act like pigs! Pigs should act -- ?&quot;

&quot;In a non-pig related manner?&quot; Eve put forth, to which the wolf said 
&quot;Uhhh -- ok, that works.&quot; the wolf replied, looking over at Keiko with 
a curious expression as he spoke, &quot;Is she alright?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Eve noted with a smile, tapping Keiko on the shoulder, &quot;She&#39;s 
just having a bad day-- but sir--&quot; she started, looking at the wolf 
with an expression of honest curiosity, &quot;What did the pigs do to get 
you so riled against them?&quot;

The wolf rolled it&#39;s eyes, almost as if it was debating just how to put 
his words, a bit of a blush forming on it&#39;s furry cheeks, &quot;Those -- 
those -- well, they are pigs, but I mean in a sense of their mannerism 
rather than their species. I mean sure they&#39;re pigs and--&quot;

&quot;What did they do.&quot; Keiko asked, cutting him off and looking at him 
with a dull expression.

&quot;They -- they harassed my wife! They whistled at her and made rude 
gestures and then - they-they tried to proposition her for SEX!! The 
perverts!! Waving money at a woman like her body was for sale!! The 
un-gentlemanly nerve of them! The avarice! The -- where is she going?&quot;

Sure enough, as Eve turned to look, Keiko was trudging up the hill 
towards the house of straw, which she proceeded to knock upon as she 
reached it&#39;s door. Eve, while sweating a bit from worry, followed behind 
as the wolf fell into pace in turn behind her.

&quot;Alright gentlemen, am-scray out here. Judgment!&quot; (she waits until she 
notes a few eyes staring at her from the shuttered window) &quot;Keiko 
Yamanaka--&quot; (shows badge to the few eyes peering out at her) &quot;7th 
Judgment. If you would please step outside--&quot;

&quot;Your fascist tactics hold no fear for pigs defending their homes and 
culture, you police state bitch!&quot; the three pigs screamed in unison 
(two of them at least).

Keiko shook her head silently, grousing over their refusal as she did. 
Eve stood her ground, even with the wolf glancing at her as if to ask 
why she wasn&#39;t going towards Keiko, &quot;She likes to work alone sometimes. 
When she needs me she&#39;ll ask for my help.&quot;

Suddenly the dark haired woman started to pace in front of the door, 
staring at it intensely, &quot;Gentlemen there&#39;s no need to get on my bad 
side. Come out and let&#39;s talk this over like--&quot;

Fifty dollars pops out the door through the mail slot. &quot;Here you 
fascist whore! Shut up and blow me like the good little--&quot; The sound 
of muffled voices, and arguing could be heard, but it was far too late. 
Keiko drew her blade and with one motion raised it high above her head.

&quot;I think you made her mad.&quot; one of the pigs whispered inside.

&quot;Who cares if I made the slut m--&quot;

With one swipe she cut the door down the middle and kicked it in.

&quot;She cares.&quot; the pig who whispered the warning grunted, before all 
three quickly am-scrayed out the back and fled. Keiko, walking quietly, 
followed the three into the woods, with Eve and the wolf close behind.

&quot;Told you! I told you they were perverts! Saying things like that! Why 
we oughta--&quot;

Eve stops him, waving him off. &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s that angry yet--&quot;

Silence followed the trio as they walked on, until finally Eve walked 
forward and nudged Keiko. &quot;Uh -- Keiko? Are you angry??&quot;

&quot;Mostly at myself.&quot; she replied, eyes panning about for any sign of the 
pigs. &quot;I feel so stupid.&quot;

&quot;Shake it off. It&#39;s only one day.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s our special day.&quot; Keiko retorted, stopping for a second to catch 
her breath, &quot;I always thought shallow inconsiderate men forgot their 
anniversaries but this -- this just blows. I can&#39;t believe I forgot the 
most important day of our lives -- the day we committed ourselves to 
each other. Our special day.&quot;

Eve smirked, tapping Keiko&#39;s gloomy face as she did, &quot;The mere fact 
that your beating yourself up over it is flattering enough --&quot; (her 
face turns serious) &quot;--but still I&#39;d rather if you didn&#39;t do this. I 
like it better when your smiling.&quot;

Suddenly the wolf ran ahead, and the two spotted a house of stick upon 
which the wolf set upon with them close behind. He banged on the door 
and yelled, &quot;Oh you three are in TROUBLE!!&quot;

Silence. The three either didn&#39;t hear him (unlikely) or were ignoring 
him. Gently Eve nudged him aside as Keiko rapped on the door with her 
free hand, sword still at the ready. &quot;Don&#39;t make this harder on 
yourselves! Come out alre--&quot;

&quot;GO TO HELL, you oppressive police state whore!! Freedom to the 
oppressed!!&quot;

Keiko&#39;s face dropped and her eyes narrowed, &quot;So you have the freedom to 
wave money at innocent women and act like a bunch of--&quot;

&quot;SHE WANTED IT!!&quot; two pigs screamed, &quot;Sweet little rear bending for 
wolves! She takes five wolves a day the slut that she--&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; the wolf screamed, &quot;DON&#39;T TALK ABOUT MY WIFE THAT WAY!!&quot;

&quot;Your old whore likes having all the boys up her--&quot;

Something hissed inside.

&quot;You&#39;re making her angry!!&quot;

&quot;Who cares? His--&quot;

&quot;I MEANT HER!!&quot;

Silence.

&quot;Oh, right-- forgot about her--&quot;

Keiko ran her indestructible blade through the door, and yanked it off 
it&#39;s hinges as she wrest her blade free. As the pigs fled again Keiko 
was in hot pursuit, now chasing a little faster.

As they entered a huge valley, Keiko stopped and looked at Eve (giving 
her a minute to catch her breath) &quot;You OK?&quot;

&quot;Fine -- but -- question--&quot;

Silence greeted Eve as she stared at Keiko, &quot;Is a day really so much to 
be so angry about?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not angry.&quot; Keiko replied, to which Eve shook her head, &quot;Come on. 
I&#39;ve seen men scream worst at you and you haven&#39;t flinched like this. 
What&#39;s up? Is missing our anniversary--&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lot, alright?&quot; Keiko finally admitted, &quot;I mean I see men doing 
shit like that -- what&#39;s my excuse? I thought I&#39;d never forget it. 
Every time we hold hands, kiss, or make love I remember that moment we 
became one so long ago -- how could I have forgotten that day? It-- it 
sucks.&quot;

Suddenly, Eve snapped her fingers and with a flourish announced, &quot;Well 
that explains it then!&quot; to which Keiko could only shake her head and 
ask &quot;Explains what?&quot;

&quot;I obviously need to give you oral more often.&quot;

Keiko blinked, confused. Eve elaborated, &quot;Since you seem to remember so 
well after a good suck I figured--&quot; she smiles a bit wider as she 
swings at Keiko playfully, &quot;You get the point, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Stop being a mope.&quot;

At the house of bricks (protected by a door of steel) the trio stopped, 
Keiko (mood changed back to fair) lightly rapped on the door. &quot;Guys? 
I&#39;m willing to cut you some slack if you --&quot;

This time in response, the pigs sang a song in Winterian and shoved out 
letters to the Alliance Council in protest.

Keiko at first stood silently, then shook as her hands trembled and her 
eyes widened. She then gripped her blade tightly, veins popping up in 
her forehead, and a look of death on her face.

Eve blushed, which only confused the wolf.

&quot;What? What?? What are they singing? Whiney protest songs from the 
60&#39;s?&quot;

&quot;It sounds like they&#39;re singing a rather dirty Winterian song about two 
women who were into having sex with each other--&quot;

&quot;Is that so bad?&quot;

&quot;Well -- the song -- I think they&#39;re saying the two had a brother -- 
well it&#39;s kinda nasty and --&quot;

&quot;YOUR SO FUCKIN&#39; DEAD!!!&quot; Keiko screamed, kicking the door hard. After 
a few times (and some laughs from the pigs) she took her blade and 
worked it into the door frame between brick wall and metal door. Then, 
she stepped back and lashed out kicking her blade hard.

The blade, firmly jammed into the door would not budge. And since the 
blade was indestructible it would not break under the pressure, so it 
stood fast. And, with each kick, the sound of the metal door&#39;s hinges 
slowly wearing away could be heard. After several kicks she finally 
popped the door open as the hinges snapped, leaving the pigs to her 
&quot;mercies&quot;.

&quot;NOW YOU&#39;VE DONE IT!!&quot; One pig squealed like -- a pig.

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; the other one yelled, &quot;I&#39;m going to make her take me up 
her--&quot;

The sound of gurgling and slicing could be heard next as Keiko entered 
through the doorway.

The problem with this house, unlike the others, was that it&#39;s resident 
was a bit lazier than the first two -- and had forgotten to build a 
backdoor. Either it be from ego, or false confidence in the construct 
of his home, he felt it unnecessary to have such a thing.

That was clearly a mistake as it turned his fortress of a home into a 
deathtrap.

The screaming didn&#39;t stop for five whole minutes, and when silence 
returned Keiko stepped outside covered in blood. In her hand she held a 
sheaf of music which she tossed aside, &quot;Pigs shouldn&#39;t act like pigs.&quot;

Eve watched her pass, her face a bit pale. &quot;Oh. Did you--&quot;

&quot;Talking pigs aren&#39;t safe to eat -- too much fat in the head.&quot;

&quot;--&quot; Eve blinked, pretty certain that wasn&#39;t the answer she was 
soliciting for. Meanwhile, as for the wolf? &quot;What about my wife? Did 
they--&quot;

Keiko stopped and shrugged, &quot;Forgot to ask them. Sorry. If you&#39;d like 
you could always gather up some mystical artifacts and bring them back 
to life--&quot;

&quot;No thanks.&quot; the wolf replied, and left it at that with Keiko.

He didn&#39;t speak, nor did he bother her again for the trip back to his 
hometown.

----

That night as the two laid on a hilltop near an inn (where they were 
staying), watching the stars, Eve asked her question again. &quot;Are you 
angry?&quot;

&quot;You asked me that already.&quot; Keiko retorted, to which Eve replied &quot;I 
mean right now.&quot;

For a bit Keiko didn&#39;t reply, but finally she whispered &quot;--I guess--&quot; 
and left it at that.

&quot;Can&#39;t we just celebrate our day today?&quot;

Keiko rolls over, and stares into Eve&#39;s eyes. &quot;It&#39;s not the same. It&#39;s 
not special -- it&#39;s not -- I wanted to make it so special, I-- I feel 
like--&quot; Keiko stops as Eve presses three fingers on her lips to silence 
her, &quot;Less talk, more love.&quot;

The two kiss, rolling over and over in the grass as they held each 
other, for a time forgetting what happened and just focusing on each 
other.

----

The words Eve spoke the other night was starting to sound more and more 
appealing.

Have an anniversary party even if the anniversary is passed. But still, 
Keiko wanted it to be special. Those thoughts kept Keiko going as she 
made plans and considered her choices for gifts and plans for Eve. 
Shopping was the easy part. She kept sending Eve on fake errands while 
she did her shopping, and kept her stuff hidden in a tesseract 
backpack. Right now she was ogling the bounty of gifts and wondering 
how to celebrate, that is until she nearly ran right into Eve&#39;s back, 
which nearly caused a panic as Keiko covered her purchases (more than 
half belonging to Eve). &quot;I&#39;m not doing anything!&quot; she complained, 
shutting the pack tightly. Eve merely smiled and nodded toward her 
things, &quot;I thought of that too, but that&#39;s not important now.&quot;

&quot;What is?&quot;

&quot;I think I found work here for us. Look--&quot;

She pointed to a newsstand and one of the city&#39;s daily papers, on it 
below the headline &quot;Prince Hunted by Angry Mob&quot; was the heading &quot;How 
she became a rich woman in one week - find out her secrets from the 
little man behind the scenes&quot;.

-----

The story was one Keiko had heard one too many times.

&quot;So your telling me that some months ago local miller offered up his 
daughter in that she had the ability to spin straw out of gold, right?&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; the local bar owner replied, busily cleaning the bar as Keiko 
spoke to him.

&quot;And nobody in their right mind could figure out that what this person 
was offering was probably way too good to be true?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d a-reckon. But then again they did take up &#39;til last week to make 
him an offer he couldn&#39;t refuse so I&#39;d a-say it took awhile for a 
gullible sort to appear.&quot;

&quot;The prince.&quot; Keiko finished, looking at him oddly, &quot;And, by the way, 
not to be overtly mean or anything but you speak with a funny accent-- 
you know that, right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d a-reckon.&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; (Keiko left it at that as she continued) &quot;And -- uh -- where 
might we find this girl from the story?&quot;

&quot;The castle over yonder. You might find the Prince too, if the angry 
mob hasn&#39;t killed him yet.&quot;

&quot;Uh-- sure, thanks. I&#39;d better hurry then, huh?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d a-reckon.&quot;

Keiko pretty much couldn&#39;t get Eve away from the male fast enough.

&quot;Local accent?&quot; Eve asked, to which Keiko replied &quot;Yeah, that was 
pretty whacked if I do say so myself.&quot;

Eve - &quot;(That&#39;s not what I mean by &quot;local&quot;.)&quot;

Keiko - &quot;(I know, I know, just kiddin&#39; -- maybe.)&quot;

As the two marched over a hill in towards a huge structure in the 
distance, Keiko pointed it out and mumbled &quot;That&#39;d be them thar&#39; place 
over yonder, I&#39;d a-reckon?&quot; (in a bad accent)

&quot;I&#39;d a-reckon.&quot; Eve remarked glibly, mimicking the old guy from
earlier.

As they reached the drawbridge screams could be heard, and instead of 
the bridge coming down to greet them out from a window flew a well 
dressed corpse that landed right in front of them.

Looking down at the body, Keiko came to one conclusion. &quot;That&#39;s one 
dead pretty boy prince.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t say. Think he&#39;s the one from the newspaper?&quot;

&quot;Know of any other princes with angry mobs after them?&quot;

&quot;Not really, no.&quot; Eve replied as the two entered the palace. Inside 
(after bypassing the now rather deceased form of the Prince) the two 
were greeted inside the castle by the now formerly angry mob (who had 
settled down and became a rather sociable rowdy gathering of folk). As 
they greeted the two newcomers, they set to discuss the &quot;change of 
power&quot; which had just occurred. As Keiko listened, she began to groan 
and grumble -- only to stop and push her way past their &quot;welcoming 
committee&quot; and into the castle. Clearly their idea of talk didn&#39;t 
impress Keiko none -- maybe it was the accents which made Keiko wince 
at every sentence they said. Eve, confused by this, quickly followed 
behind. Sure enough as she followed she had a distinct impression that 
Keiko was going to the source of the story, which they found in an 
upper palace bedroom, her diminutive visitor still there.

He turned, smiling, as he told Keiko how they met, and how he helped 
her turn straw into gold. Keiko, nodding her head as he spoke, sat down 
to examine a nearby spinning wheel and the small pile of straw 
remaining near it. As she touched it, and carefully moved her hand 
around it&#39;s frame, she removed a small blade from her pouch and started 
to carve into the nearby spinning wheel. Meanwhile, Eve was listening 
intensely to the little man.

&quot;It&#39;s quite simple really, to be turnin&#39; straw into gold. All we did 
was took it to a nearby farmer&#39;s cooperative, where it was used to 
thatch an old roof. With a drier home, the farmers became healthier and 
more productive, and they brought forth a record harvest of wheat for 
the local consumption. The children of the kingdom grew strong and 
tall, went to a cooperative school, and gradually turned the kingdom 
into a model democracy with no economic or sexual injustice and low 
infant mortality rates.&quot;

&quot;And the dead disposable body down below?&quot; Keiko remarked, motioning 
back the way the two had came as she worked on the wheel, &quot;The Pretty 
Boy Formerly Known as Prince?&quot;

The little man shrugged, &quot;That&#39;s the Prince&#39;s doing, it was. He was a 
bad boy and got on people&#39;s nerves. He got captured by an angry mob and 
was stabbed to death with pitchforks.&quot;

&quot;--so I see-- too bad.&quot;

&quot;Not really.&quot; the little man added, &quot;He squealed like a stuck pig all 
the way -- oh, sorry.&quot;

Without stopping Keiko only replied &quot;No problem.&quot; and kept working, the 
little man continuing where he left off with Eve. &quot;Anyway, as new 
investment money poured in from all over the world, the farmers 
remembered Esmeralda&#39;s generous gift of straw and rewarded her with 
numerous chests of gold. That, by the way, is how you turn straw into 
gold.&quot;

Keiko nodded her head, bored expression on her face. This kind of 
attitude really miffed the little person who grumbled, &quot;Are you paying 
attention?!?&quot;

Keiko finally stopped carving, and looked up for the briefest second 
before going back to work, ignoring the little man once again as she 
did. This further enraged the little man. &quot;Well? I&#39;d like to see you do 
BETTER than that! I don&#39;t think--&quot; he stopped as Keiko stood up from 
her kneeling position, making a few final adjustments. With that she 
grabbed a handful of straw, spun the wheel, and tossed the straw into 
the spinning wheel. From there out came gold coins that clanked onto 
the floor nosily. As she watched she noted &quot;The one hole in your so 
elaborate plan -- it CAN make gold, if your willing to wait 20-30 years,
not 7 or so days.&quot;

The little man, white and paler than usual, slowly began to back away 
only for Eve to block his retreat by stepping behind him. Keiko 
continued as she stopped the wheel, &quot;If the Prince was truly the jerk 
you say he was? No way in hell he would have waited 20-30 years, since 
jerks are seldom patient people. So -- then I noticed the faint 
markings on this wheel--&quot;

Before the little man could run, Eve quickly bound him in an entrapment 
spell to hold him. Keiko, on a roll, continued her sermon with her now 
&quot;captive&quot; audience. &quot;These etchings are the spell craft for a 
&quot;indestructible wheel&quot;. Why? Well, if you toss straw into a gold making 
wooden wheel the coins would eventually dent and damage the wood until 
it started to break down after spinning quite a few bags of gold -- 
that is, unless the wheel was indestructible then it could spin and 
spin and never wear down.&quot;

Keiko&#39;s foot taps the floor where the coins were piling up. &quot;There&#39;s a 
&quot;Gravity Well&quot; here around the wheel that drags down to this spot. I 
felt the pull as I waved my hand around the wheel. That keeps the coins 
piling up in one place and not scattering willy-nilly all over when 
they&#39;re formed. That keeps personal injury from happening, and again 
insures nothing is damaged.&quot;

Finally she pointed to the needle. &quot;This is a GlitterEye, a gold making 
needle. It can turn inanimate lifeless objects of a thin quality 
(string, straw, etc) into gold. Living objects wouldn&#39;t be affected by 
the GlitterEye, but it&#39;ll spin things like thread, yarn, straw or even 
wheat or rice into gold. Vines and weeds won&#39;t work because their 
organic structure is too dense for the eye to process. It also doesn&#39;t 
work on artificially created threads like polyester, and since this 
Prince had a castle full of stuff with artificial twists the only thing 
that could be used to make gold was straw.&quot; (Keiko snapped her fingers, 
looking straight at the little man for the first time) &quot;I&#39;m more than 
willing to bet that it was you who whispered the ludicrous idea into 
this girl&#39;s father&#39;s ear about the whole &quot;straw into gold&quot; scheme. 
Later, once the story spread, you whispered it into the prince&#39;s ear 
and got him all hot and bothered by it, all to set this little gold 
minting place up.&quot;

The little man, sweating bullets, struggled in Eve&#39;s spell as Keiko 
leaned down to look him in the eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me, let me guess -- 
we&#39;re back to baby selling, right? And you would be -- let me see -- 
Rumpelstiltskin?&quot;

&quot;AGGHHH!!!&quot; shrieked the little man, &quot;But-- but-- how did you know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the one who hauled your butt into jail the LAST time you tried 
this stunt, remember?!?&quot;

&quot;--&quot; (he looked at her intently) &quot;--I thought you were abit 
taller--&quot;

&quot;--&quot; (Keiko glared at the little man until he promised not to speak 
again).

-----

Outside the castle, Esmeralda (the woman in question earlier, the 
&quot;miller&#39;s daughter&quot;) thanked Keiko and Eve. &quot;With the Prince&#39;s gold I 
plan to move to the Dream Continent of the United States, open a 
birth-control clinic, and show other womyn how not to be enslaved by 
their reprod--&quot;

&quot;AHEM!!&quot; a female voice rang out, bringing Esmeralda&#39;s head about, &quot;And 
what about me?&quot;

She smiled sheepishly and blushed, &quot;Oh, Gaia-- eh--&quot;

A tall woman with flowing green hair walked down the stairs giving 
Esmeralda a stern look, &quot;What did I say about that god-awful &quot;Birth 
Control&quot; clinic? The dream world has few Dreamlings already, and my 
&quot;children&quot; are SUPPOSED to &quot;multiply&quot; and be fruitful!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s so male-centric.&quot; Esmeralda replied, to which Gaia shot back, 
&quot;I&#39;m the Goddess of the Living Dream Earth, so shoot me if I happen to 
like the idea of multiplying fruitful things!&quot;

By this time Keiko had rounded up Eve and Rump and they made good their 
escape. On the road Keiko gave Rumpelstiltskin a severe look, &quot;Why do 
you ALWAYS pick the losers to exploit?!?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a genetic weakness of character I suppose.&quot;

Eve merely shrugged, &quot;At least she didn&#39;t invite us to stay for 
dinner.&quot;

Keiko - &quot;--don&#39;t jinx us, please--&quot;
