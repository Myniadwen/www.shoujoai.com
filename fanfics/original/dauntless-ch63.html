<p><strong>VOLUME NINE: MIDDLE OF NOWHERE</strong></p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Drifting: life’s meaningless without goals”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It’s quiet.</p>
<p>We’ve been drifting in space now for a few days, our  next destination uncertain, our nerves on edge, our doubts and  concerns growing. Venus has changed us all, some far greater and far  more obvious than others— Chandra the most, by far, although I’ve  noticed that Amy hasn’t been “herself” either, whatever that  means. If what she says is true, then this has been the second time  she forced herself away from that paradise, back into the dreary  world of clouds, cold, and shadow, where nothing good or pure ever  exists, only its dim reflection. None of us have any idea what she  was like before her first visit, but if her present condition is any  indication, we probably would not have recognized her. Sometimes I  wonder if the person in the mirror is really me, or merely a  “potential” me.</p>
<p>There is now a twenty-fifth member of the crew, the  only male among us, and I believe, the most frightening and awesome  person I have ever met— more so because he is so <em>subdued</em>, so  very subtle and quiet that he can’t help but radiate a certain  energy, an essence, a life-force even beyond Rachel’s. Miracle  introduced him as Oris Pendragon, first and last to hold that office,  and she spent many hours trying to adjust him to our world, and us to  his. We learned that he was old, very old, insurmountably ancient,  and equally powerful, last of the true Wizards— or Art-wielders, as  he calls it. He came from a land called Numenor, which was once a  glorious continent of Gaea, but was destroyed, leaving few survivors.  I’m not sure how, but when he speaks, we can all understand him in  our own native language. Riene theorized that it must have something  to do with a tower her ancestors built, or a curse, and that people  born before that time must not be affected by it.</p>
<p>Idiots.</p>
<p>He makes all of us look like idiots.</p>
<p>Every one.</p>
<p>There were several things Oris understood that I didn’t  think someone like him would, and just as much he couldn’t grasp  that I thought was perfectly clear. He seemed intimately familiar  with the ship and worked his way around as if he had built it, and  also easily acquainted himself with the kitchen, the bathroom, the  gymnasium, library, and laboratory. That it flew through space didn’t  seem to concern him; it felt like something very ordinary to him. Of  our food, he only seemed interested in bread, cold meat, cheese, some  fruits and vegetables native to Gaea, and wine. However, he seemed  puzzled by our baths and our beds, our windows and our eating  utensils (he ate everything with his bare hands), our rooms and our  clothes.</p>
<p>For example, a conversation I overheard: “Mirari,”  (which is how he addressed Amy), “I give you great thanks. I cannot  understand the way you live, and your ship is strange to me. Oh no,  not its construction, for those with the mind for it could imbibe the  Craft and create vessels of even greater design. Nay, I speak of your  daily customs, which must seem commonplace outside of my alien  experience. You give me a bath that the King himself might envy, but  no one attends me to it; a bed soft as clouds, but when I rise, I  must dress myself as if I were a peasant. I lie in a room with  windows of pure crystal so you can see Deep Heaven as clearly as the  darkest night, but I lie in it alone with no more honor than a  prisoner. Your people eat strange, tasteless food but it is off  plates as smooth as ivory and as round as a halo. In all the ship  there is warmth that might put one in mind of terrestrial paradise;  but no glory, no splendor, no might nor bard nor majestic craft. You  seem to me to live neither like a rich woman nor a poor one; neither  like a lady nor a nun. Mirari, I tell you these things because you  have asked me. They are of no importance. When the construct designed  for the reparation of devices has left, it will be time for us to  open counsels to each other.”</p>
<p>I got out of there as soon as I could, the hairs on my  head standing bolt upright. I suppose the Pendragon could sense  things like that. Naja tried robbing him in his sleep, but he sat up  at once, as if he had been merely lying down, and commanded her to  leave, which she had little power to resist. It also seemed no  strange thing to be surrounded by green-skinned people, crazed women  with six arms, anthromorphic beings, and everything else our eclectic  menagerie might have, but he was stunned when he heard what Chandra’s  purpose was:</p>
<p>“In Numenor old, scarce were dens of prostitution,  yet I was not blind to their presence or their function. Yet even in  their darkest corners there was honor made. The eons have weathered  away this small prestige, and I have been prepared for evil changes,  but never in all my years would I suspect a whore designed, by birth,  for indiscriminate lechery and perversion. You have the falsest woman  yet in your fellowship, Mirari. The cold marriages of Sulva depend  entirely upon dolls made to imitate flesh and warmth; here now I see  their personification among you.”</p>
<p>“Lord Pendragon,” Amy said in her defense, “she  is not in control of her actions. It is said that sometimes destiny  chooses our paths for us, and here it has worked its fell hand. True,  an outside force designed her that way, but she has a mind and a  heart of her own. The lady is virtuous enough once you get to know  her.”</p>
<p>“If she were under my authority, I would have her  head and be done with it,” he gestured. “Yet she is yours, and I  shall only give you council. I am also concerned with the actions of  the other women of this vessel. The Felinis I may dismiss from  judgment since their discourse is necessary for continuation of the  species, but have the others not cast aside proper marriages and  honored lords to congregate with their own sex? Have the practices of  Sulva spread so far, or have the great laws bent during my long  exile?”</p>
<p>“It is not within my authority to say, even though I  may carry Solomon’s ring,” she replied. “These unions may very  well be my fault for encouraging their close quarters over a long  time. Two people may learn to love each other if they spend enough  time in one another’s company, even if they are enemies.”</p>
<p>“You speak truthfully. I have answered your question  only because you asked it of me. However, office or no, my greatest  concern is directed to those two who have so blatantly refused such  an open invitation. Much as I may normally oppose a union, theirs is  crucial to our survival. How has it come to pass that they ignored so  many blatant signs? Can even this destiny you speak of fail?”</p>
<p>“Men and women have grown doubtful and uncertain of  themselves since your day. There is time yet, Lord. And they have  progressed so far since I first met them. Like all humans, they make  the greatest strides in times of adversity. Perhaps one last  calamitous push is all they need. But we are straying too far; we  must discuss more immediate concerns. After all, since you have  arrived, I have come that much closer to my goal.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.” I couldn’t bear to hear anymore and  went walking, to clear my mind and to keep myself busy. For the  longest time, none of us attempted to continue with our daily lives  and hobbies. I believe we are all still stunned by what we witnessed  on Venus— and the actions we performed once her spell robbed us of  our senses. For once I could not roll my eyes in disgust and feign  chaste superiority over one and all: I too succumbed. So, at last I  understand why people obsess over sex and sexuality, though it has  cost me dearly for the knowledge. Maybe I’ve been a little too hard  on Chandra. Anyway, during these days of stillness, the Pendragon  toured our ship and met all the crew. I gave him a wide berth and  tried not to look like an idiot, but I doubt everyone else was so  considerate.</p>
<p>“Wh-what do you want?” Kate Shepherd stood staring  at the Pendragon cautiously as he slipped into the hallway, silently  and invisibly despite his size and the color of his robe. Friedrich  Nietzsche once said that “if you gaze into the abyss, the abyss  gazes also into you”; I think Kate must’ve been experiencing this  as the two beings stood still in Middle of Nowhere. I watched them  from afar and had to forcibly remove myself in order to continue my  journey; otherwise I might have stood paralyzed beyond the flow of  time, as HE did when he was in exile, or Kate had been for that one  little moment. I can’t imagine what a person must be feeling when  they leap away from time’s flow, nor would I want to. In any case,  the Pendragon finished his impromptu study and made a gesture that  apparently freed Kate from his spell.</p>
<p>“Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster,”  he warned her, melting her with his liquid-crystal eyes. Kate broke  free, slipping to the floor, muttering about sensations I’d never  heard of before picking herself up and moving along. I get the  feeling that he looked into her mind during those long seconds and  knew her in a way even more intimate than Allegra could claim. It  wasn’t until an hour later when I learned he had also been quoting  Nietzsche, which stunned me into a stupor.</p>
<p>He interacted more fully with the crew a day later,  when life seemed to be at its lowest. The old man was wandering  around, either completely aimless or else on some high quest that  none of us could fathom, and slipped into the garage, which I had  been keen on entering myself, seeing as how things were so dull  around here and I needed something to occupy myself. I knew for a  fact that he was aware of my presence— he seems to know exactly  where everybody is at every time of day— but I was prepared for the  surprise this time. Thankfully, I wasn’t at the foremost of his  thoughts: he was, as I suspected, more interested in the maintenance  crew.</p>
<p>“What have we here?” he stated, tapping his glowing  staff on the floor. I could see nothing but heard everything: I was  in hiding, for what good it did me. “What secrets have passed from  the smelting-pots of elder days, what charms and concoctions have the  epochs of recent years given us? I espy a craft that can replace  limbs. And thee…” He paused. Rebecca spoke next. She had been in  there a lot; sometimes I forget that she can modify things like  weapons and tools.</p>
<p>“What about me?” she said, her voice shaky. Poor  woman. Everything stopped in the garage, and I held my breath. I  could hear the Pendragon gasping slowly and quietly, like he was  preparing to sing or yell and needed a show of force to brace his  audience, but nothing came from it. That startled me more, if that  makes any sense.</p>
<p>“Nothing. For now, I hope. One among you will shortly  be the cause of great discord. She will betray all the hours save  two.” The Pendragon stumbled away in silence— and I mean that  literally; he was leaning heavily against his stick and clutching the  wall for support, his reddish face fairly pale, his eyes blazing as  he caught his breath. I might have forgotten to mention, but…he  makes prophecies sometimes. Don’t ask. I watched as he left the  garage, and slipped inside after a moment. Eve, Mink, Kyrie, and  Rebecca were all resuming their work on some new contraption that  would be of use to us, and it was clear from the look in their eyes  that they had been stricken by the Muses. I stood watching them until  Kyrie noticed me and waved.</p>
<p>“Hey babe, number five is here.” Eve looked up from  her work and grinned; she was covered in grease and oil, but still  looked fairly beautiful, I guess. She approached me, looking into my  eyes, and I stared back, wondering what this was about.</p>
<p>“Great timing. You come to help us out?”</p>
<p>“With what?” I replied. She pointed to a desk, and  what looked like a large operating table with scraps strewn around.  There was an ambiguous metal skeleton on the slab, presumably their  project, the metaphorical canvas still white and eager for shape.</p>
<p>“Oh, just a secret project of mine. I’ve been  toying with the idea ever since I lost Zeta. Come on over and check  out the specs. You’d be perfect for my new crew.”</p>
<p>“Your crew?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she said as I joined them. “Once I feel  I’m good and ready, I’m gonna open up my own shop. I won’t just  be fixing things; I’ll be making them, as well. Mostly custom jobs,  of course.”</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>“You see that thing that looks like a large hand?  Yeah, that. I’m gonna need your tiny fingers to get in there and  regulate the energy flow from up here. Mink, see those big metal  plates over there? I need you and Kyrie to weld those here…and  here. Becks, give her a blow torch, will ya?”</p>
<p>“Why both of us?” Mink said.</p>
<p>“See how big this is gonna be? I need a strong Yun  and a skilled Pyrosian to pull it off. God, I’m lucky! I got the  best crew in the universe right here!”</p>
<p>“So what’s this going to be again?” I asked as I  booted the pseudo-hand’s power up. It didn’t look like anything:  even <em>skeleton</em> was being generous.</p>
<p>“Let’s call it an <em>advantage</em> for the time  being,” Eve replied.</p>
<p>“She says that because she doesn’t even know,”  Rebecca said as she handed Mink a blow torch, a face guard, an apron,  and gloves. “She just started putting something together and asked  us to help. I don’t mind, of course: it’s good to be modifying  parts again. Takes my mind off a lot.”</p>
<p>“I think Helios 2 affected our creativity <em>and</em> sexuality,” Kyrie said. Eve smiled at Mink, nudged her, and resumed  her work, I following with renewed zeal. Rebecca was my partner and  we were mainly responsible for making sure that the machine had the  right amount of power in the right places. Eve and Kyrie traded ideas  at a ferocious speed, like they were in a competition to see who  could outsmart the other, and Mink was our muscle and gofer, filling  in whenever we needed an extra pair of hands. Before I knew it, three  hours had passed and we had earned our first break, but when I sat  back and stared at our handiwork, it still looked like a formless  lump of scrap. Eve and Kyrie were smiling, though, with bright eyes  and rosy cheeks. Whatever.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>I don’t get other people. I mean, I know I’m some  construct created for the sole purpose of repairing and maintaining  spacecrafts, and I’m not <em>supposed</em> to understand how the  human mind works, but I’ve been up and running for eighteen years,  quickly going on nineteen, and you tend to pick up things when you’re  around long enough. Going on this voyage helped me with this more  than you know— I really became human. First off, although I am  loathe to admit it, I’m a little worried about Chandra. I mean,  Venus really changed her, too, and now that I’ve had a taste of her  life, I can understand her a little more. But she’s been hanging  around Amy a lot, either to seduce her or seek guidance, and Amy’s  changed so much that I’m actually worried about a woman I used to  despise. Neither of them are the same person. I’m a little  frightened when I look at them. But whatever.</p>
<p>Eve’s got me puzzled the most. I had to use the  bathroom one night and I heard her making love to Kyrie as I was  walking back to my room. It wasn’t any of my business, but didn’t  she and Mink have a special connection? I mean, I don’t know why I  should be worried— Mink and Shana are close, right, and one less  rival out of the way… Urgh, there I go again. This is confusing.  What’s worse is that a day later, I saw Eve and Mink heading into  the same room, muttering about taking a shower together. Ugh. I  questioned my teacher about it and she chalked it up to heredity. It  seems her mother was a regular heat-breaker back in her heyday, and  all that sleeping around finally cost her in the end. You’d think  that Eve would know better after hearing about this, but…like I  said, I just don’t understand people. Or Yuns and Pyrosians, for  that matter.</p>
<p>I’ve been seeing less and less of Valti. I wonder why  that is. I mean, don’t get me wrong: the woman’s insane, I think,  in a pleasant sort of way. She’s nice to Rebecca and the twins, but  it’s kind of nice not having her around to freak me out. I did  catch her saying something to Kay and Tee one day, though: something  about an experimental process that could separate them from each  other. It was all science-fiction, something she would definitely  try— her or that insane lover-mentor of hers, Rebecca’s deceased  mad scientist father. Now that I think about it, I’m not sure what  could’ve possessed him to give his daughter those wings, or to make  Valti sprout arms, or to keep a vial of every living creature’s  genetic coding lying around. I knew I couldn’t ask Rebecca, and I  couldn’t very well forget about it (it plagued me when Eve didn’t  have anything for me to do), so I asked the only other person who I  thought might know something about it.</p>
<p>For a man two meters tall that can carry his voice  across the entire ship and gives off a radiation like sunlight, the  Pendragon was amazingly difficult to find. Amy said that “if he  doesn’t want to be found, he won’t be,” but suggested I keep  looking, as he was “bound to show up”. I decided to ask her while  I was at it, but all she did was grasp her foot and say she didn’t  know. There was a distant look in her eyes, like she was trying to  look at something at the edge of the universe, and she felt cold as I  touched her. I was about to get Fuuka when she recovered and said she  was all right.</p>
<p>“But one idea does come to mind,” she stated as I  left, so quietly that I almost missed it. “All life is a pursuit of  knowledge and happiness. Professor Hill must have been working for  some higher goal back then. Perhaps he crumbled under the weight of  his own revelations.” In any case, he certainly wouldn’t be  around to give the twins their own individual bodies, and he wouldn’t  be able to make Valti normal again.</p>
<p>Now that’s something that even Rachel could never do!</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>There was at least one certain positive outcome from  our trip to Venus. Fuuka, along with everybody else, came back a  changed woman, but she diagnosed her change in medical terms, and  came to a very shaky, very striking conclusion. Whatever had been  debilitating her (or whatever <em>would</em>) had completely passed,  gone away forever like a bad dream. She checked herself five times  before she arrived at this conclusion, and after taking a few hours  to come to terms with this information, she announced it to the ship  in no steady terms. I know what happiness is, but I wasn’t familiar  with joy until now, yet what I saw there convinced me it was a real  thing, and far different from the casual word I know. Fuuka was  frightened to death and yet wonderfully at peace, as if some dreadful  task of hers had been completed by somebody she never even knew. I  think I understood what she was feeling, but…</p>
<p>Anyway, she hypothesized that it was the work of Helios  2 that cured her. Whether it was the air, the water, the food, or  some magic woven into the world, she was restored and stronger than  ever: much stronger, in fact, than many of her race are wont. I’m  not saying she could match Athena, or even Mink, but she’s far more  energetic now than she used to be, and of course, more enthusiastic.  She made merry during our long stages of Nothing and spread her  cheerful virus all around the ship. She played with me and made love  to Athena for hours on end. But more importantly, she had hope anew:  not for herself, but for Alan Suing, Shana’s brother.</p>
<p>“So if you’re cured,” Shana logically concluded  when she heard the news, “then does that mean…uh…maybe…”</p>
<p>“There could very well be a cure out there for your  brother after all.” She cast her somber Kitsune’s eyes upon Oris,  and he cast his upon hers, an abyss also gazing. “One could hope.  Lord Pendragon, dare I hope that Helios 2 played some part in this?”</p>
<p>“But of course,” he replied quietly. “How can you  help but acquire a stronger health after setting foot upon that  blessed realm? And so it was with the forbearers of Man: that they  who left Paradise behind did not easily find death. Though none of  your number will achieve such longevity, having but a taste will cure  diseases that may normally confound the best of us.”</p>
<p>“Then we must go back, for one among us has a brother  who is as close to death’s door as I once was.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a destination to me,” Aseria smiled.  Oris squinted his eyes and furrowed his bushy brows, glaring with  cool disapproval.</p>
<p>“Nay, none of us are permitted to return there now.  Not a soul among us will ever set foot upon Perelandra’s blessed  shores.”</p>
<p>“But we have to go b— ”</p>
<p>“I know your mind, good doctor,” he stated, brows  arching in a firmer glare. “But tell me, were we to return, what  remedy would you seek? What nostrum would you select from  Perelandra’s cornucopia to repair the damage done? You know not,  and our chances of returning are still impossible. But there is hope  yet, always hope so long as the fruit of the tree still bears seeds.”  For once his words had an obvious connotation to them, and our eyes  fell upon the living staff he carried, the one Amy said he plucked  from a branch deep in Venus’s womb. He gently pinched one of the  staff’s leaves, and we all understood what he meant.</p>
<p>“So then…” Shana started to cry and ran up to the  old man, but she couldn’t make the distance; he rebuked her with a  gesture.</p>
<p>“The leaves of this Tree are not to be used lightly.  If it were my council, we would spare them for greater peril, and  indeed, we shall face them before journey’s end. Not for nothing  did I ensconce on this ship. But I am merely a servant and will take  my predecessor’s words before my own.” He bowed to Amy, who might  have stammered and blushed under such pressure. That measureless,  glassy expression in her eyes remained even in this casual setting,  and without hesitation, she made it so.</p>
<p>“Then it is agreed. We have our destination. We will  see Epitaph. But understand this, Singing Cherubim: thy brother will  see death soon or late, and no potion can save him from that fate,  nor any Craft I am aware of, save the Creator’s divine will. And by  sparing him, other lives may be forfeited. The weight of your  consequences must rest on your shoulders, as mine are upon mine.”  He left without saying another word, not even to prophesy. A chill  ran up my spine and I approached Shana, to comfort her. What a  useless gesture: she was beyond comfort and consolation now.</p>
<p>But Mink watched me try before going away. She had  something to work on.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Shana: We’re going to Epitaph… We’re going to cure  my brother!</p>
<p>Fuuka: Kami-sama willing.</p>
<p>Valti: Hey, what’s going on here? Did I miss  something!?</p>
<p>Shana: EEK!! D-don’t sneak up on us like that!!</p>
<p>Valti: Hee hee hee.</p>
<p>Fuuka: Where’d you come from, anyway? And where <em>have</em> you been?</p>
<p>Valti: Oh, just a little place I like to call THE  FUTURE. Oh yeah, I’ve been there.</p>
<p>Shana: Oh, brother, here we go. Do tell. (Sarcasm!)</p>
<p>Valti: You probably won’t believe me even if I tell  you, but…in the next chapter…the <em>Dauntless</em> gets overrun…BY  GHOSTS!</p>
<p>Shana: EEK! Stop doing that!!</p>
<p>Fuuka: Is this one of those “obligatory ghost ship”  chapters? Well, it did happen in <em>Tenchi Universe</em> and <em>Irresponsible Captain Tylor</em>…</p>
<p>Valti: Bwahahaha!! Your expansive anime knowledge can’t  save you this time! It’s a creepy and a kooky, an eerie and a  spooky time in the next chapter, “Haunted Dauntless: unwelcome  visitors from beyond the grave!”</p>
<p>Shana: Darn it, why does this stuff always happen in  science-fiction stories?!</p>
