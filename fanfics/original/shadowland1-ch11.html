You Don&#39;t Belong Here 

The day grew dark and long shadows stretched out across the streets as 
Kris walked down the road with thoughts of her studies in her mind. She 
tried hard to shake them from her head and think about Jenn. Jenn... to 
Kris she was her closest and dearest friend, almost family. For the past 
while she had been holding onto a secret and now with this new arrival 
Kris was beginning to wonder if that was truly the right idea. Something 
about Kimberly&#39;s sudden appearance bothered her. She couldn&#39;t put her 
finger on it right that moment, but she had a feeling that something big 
was about to happen, and she didn&#39;t like surprises. Loathed them to be 
exact. Her life had been filled with one surprise after another and she 
longed for a day when she could relax a little and not have to be on 
edge all the time. Finally when she felt that things were settling down 
this red haired girl drops in out of nowhere and it gave her an 
unsettling feeling and she felt her nerves on edge the entire afternoon. 
Whatever was going to happen she hoped it was nothing special and would 
pass by with ease, but she suspected that would not be the case here, it 
never was.  
                                                       
Arriving at the front of Jenn&#39;s house, and seeing the darkened windows 
made her stomach sink. She had a sensation that her wish for things to 
play out quickly was coming true, however this was not going to be the 
simple breeze she wished for. Jenn should have been home by now and to 
she double checked her watch, which told her it was well past eight pm, 
only to increase that worry that was building up inside of her. Hastily 
she scanned the streets, expecting, no hoping, to see her friend come 
running towards her, however she was only greeted by the lines of 
streetlights as they flickered to life and the red sun disappearing 
behind the silhouette of houses off in the distance. Slowly, and 
cautiously, she moved through the front gate, cringing as it squeaked on 
its hinges and freezing in place as her eyes studied the house before 
her. Shadows nearly encased the entire house, almost as if they 
stretched out like long finger greedily embracing the building, claiming 
it as their own. This sight only stirred Kris&#146;s stomach all the more as 
a pit of dread began to burrow its way through her insides. Something 
about the shadows did not sit well with her, they should have been some 
light shining across the house from the falling sun and not this level 
of darkness. To reassure that she was not acting paranoid she glanced 
over at the neighbouring houses to see that they were indeed not 
completely shrouded in darkness. Something unnatural was causing these 
shadows to act in this matter and these only made her need to find out 
if Jenn was inside intensify all the more and she continued her way up 
to the house. A part of her wanting to believe that Jenn was simply 
napping inside but somehow she knew that wouldn&#39;t be true. Carefully she 
stepped up the wooden stairs to the porch, being sure to not make a 
sound, and opened the screen door, She was about to test the knob when 
she noticed the shadows move ever so slightly at the far end of the 
porch and slowly she stepped away from the door, squinting slightly to 
get a better look at what was hiding just out of her range of sight. 
That was when she saw it. At first she did not know what she was seeing 
and then it came into clear focus. A long leg stepped casually out of 
the shadows, a leg belonging to a rather tall man, so large was this man 
that there was no way he could have been hiding without Kris seeing him 
and yet somehow he melted with the shadows as if they were one with 
them. The fact that he was clad in long white cloak flowed around him, 
occasionally revealing the black suit he wore underneath, only 
reinstated that this man could not have been hiding easily, he should 
have stood out against the darkness of the buildings paneling. Even his 
hair was stark white hair almost, glowed in the streetlight, surrounding 
a long narrow face. He slowly turned to face Kris, towering over the 
girl, who was used to feeling like she was the tallest and currently was 
having troubles finding her voice. She took a step back as his menacing 
black eyes bore into her, almost examining her very soul. 

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; She demanded boldly, finally finding her 
voice. The man moved swiftly, as if he truly was one of the shadows, and 
before Kris knew what was happening there was a thick hand around her 
throat and she was slammed against the side of the house. She clenched 
her teeth against the pain as the man lifted Kris off the ground to eye 
level and examined her even closer, as if he were studying her. 

&quot;You don&#39;t belong here.&quot; He said slowly, almost carefully, his face 
merely inches from hers and she could smell something sickening upon his 
breath that made it even harder to breath. 

Kris struggled with the man&#39;s large arm, her feet dangling above the 
ground and his fingers digging into the flesh of her throat. &quot;I&#133; could 
say the same for you.&quot; She choked, trying to conceal the fear that was 
creeping up inside of her. 

&quot;Where is the child?&quot; The man demanded, slamming the girl against the 
wall another time, &#147;Tell me now.&#148; 

Kris grinned as she realized that it was Jenn that this monster was 
after, however that would mean she was right and her friend had not 
arrived home yet. &quot;If I knew I wouldn&#39;t tell you.&quot; Her voice came out in 
a low snarl as she bared her teeth at the man, showing off small fangs 
for the first time in years. 

The man smiled back at her, baring teeth that were also jagged and 
gleaming white, &quot;How long has it been?&quot; He asked sinisterly, in almost a 
mocking tone.

&quot;W.. I don&#39;t know what you are talking about.&quot; Kris stared at the man in 
confusion. 

&quot;Oh yes you do. I can sense it on you.&quot; He cocked his head and sniffed 
at the girl&#146;s hair. &quot;You came for her too, didn&#39;t you?&quot; He whispered 
into her ear, his breath like acid upon her skin. 

The fear that Kris had been hiding slowly seeping out of its cage and 
she squirmed against his grip, &#147;What do you want with her?&#148; She 
demanded, frantically clawing at the sleeve of the man&#146;s jacket, &#147;She is 
a normal little girl. She has nothing to do with the Shadows, so why 
would you want her.&#148; 

He simply smiled at her and appeared to be about to say more when the 
iron gate squeaked the arrival of another party to their conversation 
and someone began to approach them.. The man turned his head around, 
still keeping Kris pinned to the wall, and watched as Jenn approached 
them, busily fumbling with her keys, so deep in her own thoughts that 
she didn&#39;t even notice the man and her friend until her foot rested upon 
the first step of the porch. The moment she saw the man she somehow knew 
that he was the same one Kimberly had mentioned earlier. Her eyes 
quickly moved along the man&#146;s long arm to see her friend pinned 
painfully against the wall, &quot;KRIS!!&quot; She heard herself yell out in shock 
and she took another step closer. 

Kris glanced down at her friend. &quot;RUN! RU-&quot; Kris tried to yell, however 
the man started to squeeze his thumb into her throat, closing off her 
windpipe. 

He turned his attention back to Jenn and reached out his free hand 
towards her. &quot;Do not be afraid. I am here to help you.&quot; He offered, his 
upturned hand, clad in white glove.

Jenn considered fleeing, but she could not leave Kris with this monster, 
and founder herself frozen in place, unable to decide what move to make. 
&quot;I&#133;If I c&#133;come with you will you let Kris go?&quot; She asked reluctantly. 

&quot;This child?&quot; The man studied Kris carefully as he considered this 
proposition, &quot;Yes, I suppose I could leave her here.&quot; He said with a 
broad grin that made Kris shiver. 

&quot;Never!&quot; Kris snarled and something snapped within Kris and she swung 
both of her legs up around the man&#39;s arm and twisted it, causing the two 
of them to tumble over the porch rail and fall into the small garden 
below. Jenn started to run towards where the two had fallen when she saw 
the man suddenly appear out of the shadows and casually walk towards her 
with his cloak billowing around him, as if the fall had no effect on him 
what so ever. Kris jumped to her feet, lunging at the man.  &quot;Get out of 
here!!&quot; She yelled to Jenn. &quot;GO ON!!&quot; 

Jenn dropped her keys, all of a sudden finding the strength to move as 
she turned and started to flee. The man began to pursue when something 
yanked on his cloak pulling him to the ground. Jenn didn&#39;t see what 
happened after that, as she was too busy running down the street in the 
direction of the only person she could think of, Kimberly. 

The man pulled his cloak free of Kris&#146;s grasp and backhanded the girl 
across the face. To his surprise Kris blocked his blow with little 
effort and gripped onto his arm with all her strength. &quot;You will not 
have her.&quot; She growled, steadying her stance as she prepared for the man 
to try to break free once again.

The man clenched his fists, &quot;I have no time for your games, little 
girl.&quot; He stated through bared teeth.

&quot;Well, you have no choice now, do you?&quot; Kris smiled, twisting her arm 
around his and digging her heels into the ground.

&quot;Why do you stand in my way? Don&#39;t you want to help your friend?&quot; He 
asked almost with some sincerity. 

&quot;What I want is none of your business. You can&#39;t just waltz in here and 
take what you want.&quot; Kris was visibly angry. She had never felt so much 
hatred for anyone in years.

&quot;And how is your way much better?&quot; The man smiled when he saw Kris 
flinch at his word. &quot;Could it be she doesn&#39;t know? That you never told 
her?&quot; He thought to himself for a moment, &quot;Or is it that you lov_&quot;

&quot;SHUT UP!!&quot; Kris yelled, hitting the man squarely in the chest with both 
of her palm, forcing the man to the ground. &quot;Just shut the hell UP!!&#148; 
She stomped over to the man with intent to continue her assault only to 
have the man quickly get to his face and glare at her. His eyes held a 
piercing look to them that stopped Kris in her tracks. 

The man&#146;s eye reverted back to normal and he began to clap his hands 
together. &quot;So I am right. Maybe I will leave this girl to you... for 
now.&quot; He deeply bowed and faded back into the shadows from which he 
came. Kris glanced around to make sure the man wasn&#39;t trying to trick 
her and jump out of another shadow. Only when she was certain he was 
gone did Kris finally move from where she was stood and run after Jenn. 

                             *****

&quot;Mom, I wish you where here.&quot; Kimberly spoke softly to the photo on her 
dresser, her head resting under her arms, &quot;Everything is so confusing.&quot; 
She rolled her head over and placed her palms under her chin while 
gazing at her refection in the dresser mirror. &quot;Why do things like this 
keep happening to me? I finally get to see Lauren, but she wasn&#39;t the 
same... and then there&#39;s Natalie... and Jenn...&quot; She let out a sigh at 
the thought of the dark haired girl, &quot;I wish I knew what to do.&quot; She 
buried her face in her arms, &quot;Why can&#39;t I live a normal life?&quot; She let 
out a soft sob. 

Ever since leaving the caf&eacute; she could not stop thinking about both Jenn 
and Lauren and it was beginning to get to her. Jenn was nice to her and 
helped cheer her up on the way back to her place. The more Kimberly saw 
Jenn&#39;s smile the more she felt her heartache and she couldn&#39;t understand 
why. What was it about this girl that was drawing her in? What was it 
about any girl for that matter? Her eyes peeked out from behind her arm 
and she gazed at herself in the mirror again. Her nightgown loosely hung 
off her small frame, making her appear even more tiny and frail then she 
was. She could not understand why anyone would find an interest in her. 
She felt ugly and so small, her hair was a mess of long locks of bright 
red hair that she despised and her face covered with more freckles then 
she truly desired. Even her eyes were strange, and if anyone got to know 
her really well they would run away for she was overtly depressing to be 
around. Tears streaked her cheek in frustration as she stared at her 
face. 

For a while she tried to convince herself that she was not interested in 
girls in that way; that Lauren looking like a boy was the true reason 
she fell in love with her, but that didn&#39;t explain Jenn. Sure Jenn was 
charming and all, but her appearance was that of a normal girl, so Kim 
could not state that it was her boiish looks that she was attracted to. 
The more Kim thought of Jenn&#146;s smile it made heart melt and hurt all in 
the same moment and that was confusing her more then anything else. She 
had only met the girl that day so she shouldn&#146;t be having these feelings 
towards Jenn, she shouldn&#146;t. Then there was Lauren&#39;s kiss, so soft and 
sweet. Her smell and everything about her was just so... Kimberly felt 
herself blush as memories rushed through her head. She turned to her 
mother&#39;s photo, &quot;I&#39;m sorry mom...&quot; Again she buried her face in her arms 
and cried. 

Suddenly there came a knock at the door and Kimberly quickly lifted her 
head and glanced around in surprise of the sound, &quot;Dad?&quot; she inquired 
quietly, afraid of whom would answer, thinking the knocking was coming 
from her bedroom door. When there was no answer she cautiously she got 
to her feet and glanced down the long dark hall outside her room. At the 
far end of the hall she could see the small flickering of light coming 
from the television in the living room, but nothing more. Gingerly she 
crept down the hall, stopping when she approached the living room 
entrance and peeked inside. There in his sofa chair, between her and the 
little fourteen-inch television on a wobbly metal TV tray, sat her 
father. A few beer bottles could be seen on the little wooden folding 
table that sat next to him and the sounds of snoring emitting from deep 
from within his chest; a low rumbling sound that made the young girl 
relax a little for she knew that it would not be until lunch the next 
day that he would possibly wake up, and this meant another night of 
freedom for herself. 

Another knock came at the front door and Kimberly was scared out of her 
musing. She swiftly moved across the living room, through the kitchen 
and to the front door of the apartment. Along her way she wondered who 
it could possibly be as she reached for the doorknob and prepared to 
open it. Guardedly she opened the door a crack, being sure that the 
chain was in place, and peered outside. &quot;H..hello?&quot; She asked in almost 
a whisper. 

&quot;Kimberly, it&#39;s me.&quot; Jenn stood at the door shivering in the night air.

Kimberly quickly removed the chain and opened the door wider, &quot;Jenn? 
What are you doing here?&quot; She continued to keep her voice down and 
signalled to her friend to do the same. 

&quot;I...&quot; Jenn glanced around fearfully, &quot; I didn&#39;t know where to run to. 
You were right. I didn&#39;t tell you the truth before. I&#39;ve felt it too. 
Something is wrong about this place and I&#146;ve felt it for sometime.&#148; She 
explained in a hasty confused ramble. &#147;I keep seeing things, things that 
are not really here, but are.&quot; 

&quot;Seeing things?&#148; Kim stepped out into the hall, partly closing the door 
behind her, but not entirely, &#147;You don&#39;t mean?&quot; She whispered softly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Jenn continued to glance nervously over her shoulder 
as she spoke, &quot;I&#39;m so confused right now.&#148; She explained as she rubbed 
at the sides of her head, &#147;You&#146;re the only one I know who&#146;d understand. 
C&#133; could I please come inside? I&#39;m scared.&quot; She wrapped her arms around 
herself tightly as if a cold breeze just swept past her.

&quot;Inside?&quot; Kimberly tried to see what it was that had scared her new 
friend, scanning the halls for any sign of someone following the girl, 
or something&#133; Then glanced inside her house and thought about what her 
father would think if he found Jenn here. &quot;Ummm... I don&#39;t know...&quot; She 
said nervously.

&quot;Please,&quot; Jenn begged, reaching out to lightly tug upon Kim&#39;s sleeve, &quot;I 
have nowhere else to go.&quot; Her eyes were wide with fear as she again 
glanced down the hall and back at the girl before her. 

Kimberly took another look around as she nervously licked at her lips 
and then glanced back into the house, and then nodded for Jenn to enter, 
but put a finger to her lips to signal that she could not say a word. 

Jenn gladly nodded as she followed the girl into the apartment, silently 
closing the door behind her before kicking off her shoes on the mat near 
the front door, then followed as the redhead soundlessly crept back 
through the kitchen. Kimberly stopped for a second when she came to the 
door to the living room and made a silent prayer to her mother, before 
continuing towards her room. 

&quot;Kim, &#145;ho was dat at the dor?&quot; Kim&#39;s father groggily called out, not 
moving from his chair. Kimberly stared at Jenn with worry in her eyes. 
She tried to think fast but it wasn&#39;t fast enough because her father was 
beginning to turn around and Kimberly froze in place as she felt his 
eyes set on her.    

Jenn could not see who had spoken because he was backlit by the 
television, but she could feel his eyes move over her, inspecting her 
with such scrutiny that it made her skin crawl. Finally he turned back 
to Kimberly, &quot;Kim, &#39;ho is dis girl?&quot; he asked with a drunken slur. 

&quot;She is... a...&quot; Kimberly gazed at Jenn and stammered, trying to think 
of some kind of excuse that would get them both out of that room and 
safely into her bedroom.

&quot;I&#39;m a friend from school, sir.&quot; Jenn suddenly cut in, willing her legs 
to stop shaking as the man&#146;s eyes moved back to her, &quot;I was the one who 
dropped Kim off earlier.&quot; She tried hard not to let her voice betray 
her. &quot;I forgot something--&quot; 

&quot;I was speakin&#39; to my child &#39;ere.&quot; He said pointing at Kimberly as he 
started to stand.

Kimberly quickly stepped forward, standing between Jenn and her father, 
&quot;Dad, she just came by to... help me catch up with school.&quot; She hoped 
her father was too drunk to see through her lie, but feared that was not 
likely. 

&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me.&quot; He spat, &quot;You are jst like you mother. De both of 
you.&quot; He pointed from Kimberly to Jenn and back again. 

Kimberly realized that she was not going to get away easily but she 
didn&#39;t want Jenn to get involved. &quot;I&#39;m not lying. She is from my cla-&quot; 
Her words where cut off by a sharp smack across her left cheek that sent 
the small girl crashing head long into a nearby wall. 

Jenn felt herself cringe as the sound echoed throughout the room the 
tiny room, a hollow thud that sounded as if Kim&#146;s skull had cracked on 
impact. Jenn breathed a sigh of relief as she watched her friend slowly 
push herself into a seated position. 

&quot;How many times do I have to tell you not to talk back to me?&quot; He 
snarled as he towered over the girl, Kimberly glanced up just in time to 
receive another blow to the face. She landed on her hands and knees and 
let out a small cry of pain. Her left eye was bruised and she knew that 
in the morning it would blacken, but this wasn&#39;t so bad. No, she learned 
years ago how to shut off the pain. It was what usually came after that 
really scared her. When her father would drag her back to her room to 
teach her the real lesson. 

Her father raised his fist once again and was about to bring it down on 
his daughter when Jenn threw herself at the man. &quot;STOP IT!!&quot; She yelled 
out as she grabbed onto the man&#146;s arm in an attempt to stop the blow 
from connecting with her friend, &quot;She didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I 
dropped by without calling. I&#39;m sorry, just stop hitting her!&quot; The man 
turned and with one easy sweep of his arms Jenn was thrown backwards off 
her feet and came crashing down on an end table knocking beer bottles to 
the floor with a crash, sending shards of glass sprinkling across the 
ground, reflecting the static of the television. 

The man unstably turned his attention on Jenn as he moved across the 
living room, tossing the remains of the table off the girl and grabbed 
her by the back neck, &quot;It would seem we have someone else who needs to 
be taught a lesson.&quot; He stated as he leaned over the girl&#39;s shoulder and 
spoke into her face, &quot;Don&#39;t you think so?&quot; 

Jenn closed her eyes tight as his beer soaked breath invaded her senses 
and it made her cough. She felt his rough fingers tighten around her 
neck as his other hand began to ensnare the hairs at the top of her head 
and he suddenly dragged her to her feet and started down the hall.

&quot;Wa-&quot; Jenn tried to speak only to feel the man&#39;s other hand tighten 
around her throat. Eyes widened in as every possible torture this man 
had prepared for her began to enter her mind. She struggled with all her 
strength as the man dragged her through the door to his room and slammed 
it shut.

Kimberly wobbled and tried to stand, only to find dizziness overcome her 
and she dropped to the ground once again. She knew exactly what her 
father had planned for her friend, knew the suffering she would go 
through on this night, but could not find the strength in her to fight 
her father and as such she sunk to the floor, sobbing to herself. Then 
she heard Jenn&#39;s screams and it was like a knife in her heart. She could 
not allow this to happen to her new friend. She knew how to shut off the 
pain -- She knew how to block out everything -- but Jenn wasn&#39;t her. 
Jenn was her friend. Someone she cared for. Someone she... loved? 

Kimberly&#39;s eyes suddenly opened wide and willed her legs to stand. 
Hastily she moved to the kitchen, using the wall to stabilize her, and 
tossed the contents of one of the boxes onto the floor. Silverware of 
all types clattered to the ground making such a ruckus that she had to 
hold her hands to her ears as the sound echoed off the kitchen walls. 
She nervously glanced over her shoulder to be sure that her father had 
not heard her, or realized what she was about to do. She imagined him 
coming burling out of the bedroom, death in his eyes as he prepared to 
finally put an end to his daughter&#146;s life. A death that she would be 
more then willing to accept, but at this moment she could not leave her 
father alone with her friend and the sounds of another muffled scream 
snapped Kim&#146;s mind back into focus and she turned back to the silverware 
upon the floor. There, amongst the spoons and forks, she found a long 
kitchen knife, almost the length of her forearm, its blade gleaming 
brightly in the kitchen light. Carefully she picked up the knife she 
moved down the hall to her father&#39;s room. When she arrived at the door 
she was only greeted by a silence that came from the room and Kimberly 
found herself frozen with her hand on the doorknob. Taking a deep breath 
she quickly twisted the doorknob and flung the door open wide. 

There before her she saw her father on top of Jenn holding her down upon 
the bed with his back to the door. An image flashed through Kimberly&#39;s 
mind from long ago. An image of her mother stumbling upon her father in 
her room, on top of her just as he was now on Jenn, and tried to get him 
off of her. Her mother screamed as she threatened to call the police, 
but before she could get to the phone he grabbed her mother and hit her 
head off the corner of the night table. Kimberly recalled watching her 
mother bleeding on the floor beside her bed, her blood soaking into the 
white plush carpet turning it a deep shade of red. Kim quickly shook the 
thought from her head and again her eyes fell once again on father and 
Jenn. With a newfound hatred filling her heart and mind she lunged at 
her father&#146;s back and drove the knife deep between his shoulder blades. 
He let out a howl that was less then human, standing up and tossing 
Kimberly to the ground. He tried to pull the knife from his back but 
could not reach it, staggering around the room, knocking objects off the 
dress as he struggled to free himself of the blade from his back. 

His eyes fell upon his daughter and he suddenly understand what had 
happened, &quot;You little...&quot; He turned towards Kimberly with death in his 
eyes just as Kim expected that he would.

He reached out for the girl as she back-pedalled in an attempt to escape 
his wrath. Just as his hands were about to clamp around her small throat 
she closed her eyes and let out a terrified scream. Her father 
unexpectedly stopped in his tracks, as if an invisible force grabbed 
hold of him and held him from touching his daughter. He struggled in an 
attempt to break free of whatever held him and abruptly he was thrown 
off his feet, across the room, over the bed and crashing through the 
window at the far side of the room.

Kimberly warily opened her eyes, afraid that her father&#146;s was still 
standing before her. She scanned the room nervously and relaxed ever so 
slightly when she noticed that her father was nowhere in sight. Then her 
eyes fell on the broken window and she hesitantly stood to her feet, 
walking towards the window and over the shards of broken glass. Jenn sat 
up in the bed, rubbing at her tear streaked cheeks as she fix her skirt 
and tried hard not to think about what just about happened to her. She 
quickly slid off the large bed and tested her wobbly legs, then glanced 
over at Kim, who was now staring out the window.

&quot;W... What just happened?&quot; Jenn stammered as she joined the girl at the 
window, being careful of the glass strew across the floor. She was sure 
she saw Kimberly throw her own father out the window but that couldn&#39;t 
be possible, Kim was merely seventy pounds and that man had to be no 
less then three hundred. With a glance out the window she confirmed that 
the man had indeed fallen to this death and let out a sigh of relief, 
then looked at Kimberly to see the horror stricken look upon the girl&#146;s 
face and suddenly regretted feeling grateful for the man&#146;s death. 
Lightly she placed a hand upon the girl&#146;s shoulder, &#147;Oh, Kim&#133; I&#133; I&#146;m 
sorry&#133;&#148; She said, not really sure what to say considering the 
circumstances

Kimberly suddenly dropped to the floor, not caring that she was now 
sitting on shards of glass, &quot;I&#133; I killed him.&quot; She said in a daze, 
staring down at the palms of her hands as they began to shake 
uncontrollably. 

Jenn blinked at Kim, &quot;It&#133; It wasn&#39;t your fault...&quot; She was still trying 
sort out herself what just happened and knelt next to the girl, being 
sure to not step on any of the glass, unlike her friend, whom Jenn 
noticed has several small pieces of glass protruding from her feet. &quot;Are 
you going to be alright?&quot; She asked, examining at Kim&#39;s face and 
grimacing at the painful looking bruises that had begun to form around 
the girl&#146;s eye and cheek. 

Tears began to fall from the redhead&#39;s eyes, &quot;I killed him,&quot; She 
repeated, clenching her arms around her body and curling up into a ball, 
&#147;I&#133;&#148; A soft sob began to emit from the girl&#146;s chest as tears dripped 
upon the shards of the window. 

Jenn didn&#39;t know what to do. How do you comfort someone after something 
like this? In her mind the man deserved to die, he was an evil that 
needed to be purged from the world and deserved his fate more then 
anyone in the world, however she did not like seeing her friend in pain 
and longed for a way to take that pain away, to ease her worries in some 
way at all. 

Kimberly gazed down at the shards of glass and shakily picked up a large 
piece. Turning it over in the light as she watched her tears run down 
its sleek surface. &#147;I&#133; I&#133; I don&#146;t deserve to live.&#148; She muttered as she 
slowly she moved into a seated position and lightly placed the edge of 
the shard against her flesh and prepared to allow the glass to cut 
through her arm.

&quot;NO! DON&#39;T!!!&quot; Jenn cried as she grabbed the shard of glass with both 
her hands, &quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault! It wasn-&quot; The glass slashed deep into 
Jenn&#39;s fingers as her hands frantically tried to remove the harmful 
devise from the girl&#146;s hands. &#147;You can&#146;t do this. I won&#146;t let you.&#148; She 
sobbed as the glass became slick with her blood and their hands touched. 
All of a suddenly Jenn notice tingling like the first time they touched 
and suddenly something wash over the two girl, almost like electricity 
running through their bodies and a bright flash of light blinded them.
