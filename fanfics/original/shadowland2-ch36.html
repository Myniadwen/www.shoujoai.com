<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>Kima carefully climbed the basement stairs, each step creaking in 
protest under the girl&#39;s weight. She could feel herself holding her 
breath with every sound that the stairs emitted, not wanting to disturb 
whatever it was that terrified Penny so much. Within minutes she reached 
the top and stared up at the wooden door trying to will herself to open 
it. Panic was finally beginning to set into her mind and she found she 
needed to force the feeling away before it over took hold of her mind 
causing her to flee back down the stairs to the safety of Penny&#39;s hiding 
place, the thought of Penny made Kima glanced down to see the girl still 
waiting at the bottom of the stairs. Kima forced herself to smile at the 
girl, and then she wiped her sweating palmed against the legs of her 
pyjama before she took hold of the doorknob. She sucked in a deep breath 
and held it, unsure if she really wanted to know what was beyond that 
door. Summoning every ounce of courage she could muster she cautiously 
gave the knob a test turn. It made a slight squeak, however Kima felt if 
she turned it quick enough it would not make too much noise. Still 
holding her breath she place both hands upon the knob and quickly gave 
the knob a quick jerk then pushed the door open. As she suspected it 
only gave the slightly of sounds and opened smoothly

The light from a slightly ajar refrigerator door told Kima that she must 
be in a kitchen. She crept though the door and felt along the wall in 
search of a light switch when something quickly slammed the refrigerator 
door and scurried across the floor. Quickly Kima backed away from the 
shadowy thing and ducked low behind a counter in an attempt to hide from 
whatever was in the room. She cautiously scanned the room in search of 
who ever could be with her when she spotted something moving in the 
corner of her eye. The small amount of light from a window over the sick 
did not prove to be enough for Kima&#39;s eyes to focus and she needed to 
squint in the darkness to see anything. Then she saw it again, this time 
closer, it was making its way towards Kima and she was sure that it 
would be upon her soon enough. It was small, whatever it was, and could 
not have been over knee height. Kima nervously searched for the creature 
when she noticed one of the lower cupboard doors slowly creaking on its 
hinges. She slowly turned to face the cupboard, not willing to let this 
creature get the jump on her or slip passed after Penny. A pair of 
burning red eyes peered out from within the dark recess of the cupboard, 
staring directly at Kima. She shuddered in fear as those beady eyes 
glared at her through the darkness. She could feel them burning through 
her skin. It felt as if the creature was examining her soul, she 
clenched at her chest in an attempt to conceal her soul from those eyes. 
She was certain that the creature was licking its lips wanted to tear 
its claws through her flesh and feed upon her core.  

&quot;I see you.&quot; Kima muttered under her breath, &quot;You are not going to get a 
taste of me without a fight.&quot; She spotted a broom hanging on the wall 
near the counter. Slowly she moved to grab the broom, careful not to 
attract the creature&#39;s attention too much. She wrapped her fingers 
around the pole when the creature suddenly dashed across the kitchen 
floor at the redhead. Kima quickly freed the broom from its hook and 
brought it down hard on the beast&#39;s head. The blow only seemed to stun 
the creature slightly as it shook it&#39;s head and prepared for another 
attack. It shrugged the broom off of its back and rushed at Kima again. 
This time Kima punched out at the creature with her fist, tossing the 
creature high in the air. Kim was almost certain the creature felt soft 
and fuzzy, not like any animal she had ever felt before. The creature 
careened through the air and land in the sink. Hastily Kima was to her 
feet and flipped on the lights to discover a grey teddy bear laying face 
down in the sink, its limbs flailing about as it struggled to right 
itself.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kima watched the bear carefully as she approached it. Now that 
she got a better look at the creature she realized that it was not an 
ordinary stuffed animal. There appeared to be something moving under the 
fur. Like the creature was wearing the teddy bear&#39;s skin for clothes. 
Flaps of torn fabric could be seen hanging around long sharp claws. It 
reminded Kim of the teddy bear that attacked Kai in Penny&#39;s room earlier 
that same day, but much nastier. She held the broom firmly between her 
hands like rapier and prepared for the critter to move. 

Suddenly the bear lifted its head and glared at Kima. It hissed at the 
girl, the muzzle of the toy partly falling off revealing hairless grey 
features beneath its skin and jagged teeth. Teeth that Kima was sure 
would sink into her skin if she gave it a chance. Without hesitation 
Kima shoved the tip of the broom at the teddy with enough force to stab 
it directly through the chest. Green fluid burst forth from the wound 
down the sink&#39;s drain. The bear screamed out in pain as it struggled to 
free itself of the broom handle, which Kima held firmly against the bear 
not allowing it to escape. She glanced around the room to find a block 
of knives on the counter nearby. She pulled the biggest knife from the 
bunch and smiled sinisterly at the stuffed animal.  

The bear stopped fighting with the broom to stare at the gleaming blade 
in the girl&#39;s hand and the grin that broadened across her face. One 
would almost think that there was a flitter of fear in the creature&#39;s 
beady eyes as Kima brought the knife down upon it, repeatedly stabbed 
the thing, sending greenish blood flying across the room. Globs of goo 
covering the curtains that hung over the sink and splattering Kima&#39;s 
clothes as she furiously hacked the creature to bits. Only when Kima was 
sure it finally stop twitching did she discontinued her assault. Her 
mind cleared of the haze and examined the scene before her. There was 
bits of stuffing and tattered remains of the bears fur mixed with thick 
green blood all over the counter. 

Kima shakily wiped at the blood from her face as she tried to catch her 
breath. Terrified of what she had just done she dropped the knife to the 
floor and backed up to the basement door, &quot;It was only a bugbear.&quot; She 
muttered to herself, &quot;It&#39;s not the same as before.&quot; She tried to 
convince herself but she did not feel her words sinking in. 

&quot;K... kima...&quot; Penny&#39;s voice softly drifted up the stairs, &quot;Are you 
alright?&quot; She anxiously inquired. 

&quot;Penny!!&quot; She called out down the stairs, &quot;We need to hurry.&quot; She 
ordered, not taking her eyes off the gory mess. 

Penny nervously stepped upon the first stair then took a step back, 
&quot;I... I can&#39;t...&quot; She cried up at Kima. 

Kima held her hand out through the door, &quot;You need to.&quot; She commanded, 
she was almost sure that there were more of those creatures coming and 
she would not be able to fight them all, &quot;Please.&quot; She added in a 
gentler tone. 

Penny glanced around the basement then up at Kima. She took a deep 
breath then charged at the stairs, taking them two at a time. Kima 
watched in astonishment, the girl&#39;s age reversed with every step she 
took and by the time she reached the top step she was ten years old. 
Penny ran into Kima&#39;s arms that hugged her tightly. 

&quot;Good girl.&quot; Kima soothed as she stroked the back of the girl&#39;s hair. 
She figured what ever it was that lived up here must have a great amount 
of power to cause Penny to become a child again. This fact alone filled 
Kima&#39;s heart with dread. She was not sure she was ready to face whatever 
nightmares held this girl in its grip, &quot;We need to get out of here.&quot; 
Kima urgently stated, trying hard to hide her own fear.

&quot;But...&quot; Penny glanced around the kitchen, &quot;My belt...&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ll find it later.&quot; Kima promised, taking the girl by the hand and 
pulling her across the kitchen until she found a light switch and hit 
it. The room was flooded by light and for the first time Kima could 
really see where she was. They stood within a old, run down kitchen with 
water stained walls that Kim&#39;s suspected might have once been white at a 
time. There were two exits out of the kitchen and Kima was considering 
which to take when Penny began to cry. 

&quot;I... can&#39;t leave without it.&quot; She stammered vulnerably, trembling at 
the mere thought of leaving, &quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; 

Kima let out a sigh; she had no idea how she would find this belt or 
what it looked like for that matter. For all she knew it might not even 
look like a belt at all. It could be some odd symbolism that appears in 
dreams that never made any sense. She considered telling this too Penny 
when looked down into those frightened eyes as they stared at the dead 
bugbear. Kima ushered Penny&#39;s eyes away from the grotesque sight then 
glanced around the room Whatever this belt was it must be special and 
Kima finally gave in to the girl&#39;s wishes and nodded in agreement, &quot;I&#39;ll 
help you find it.&quot; She agreed.

Penny wrapped her small arms around Kima&#39;s waist and hugged her close, 
&quot;I hope you can.&quot; She stated dismally, &quot;No one else has.&quot; 

Kima let out a sigh of despair, &quot;We&#39;d better get moving.&quot; She stated and 
scanned the two exits, &quot;You have any idea where we are or which way we 
should go?&quot; 

Penny pointed to the larger opening that lead to a long dark hall. 

&quot;Of course.&quot; Kima slouched, &quot;It always has to be the darkest hallway.&quot; 
Pulling herself back to her full height she took the girl&#39;s hand and 
started across the kitchen towards the hall.
