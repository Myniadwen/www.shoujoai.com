<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 22 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>      &quot;Can&#39;t we play with her?&quot; Krystal began to awake at the sound of two girls talking.

      &quot;No, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re supposed to,&quot; Tsuki said to her little sister. She was 
currently finishing up a seal on the floor of the room. Krystal was in the middle of it.

      &quot;Not even... not even a little bit?&quot; Hina pleaded, looking at the blonde woman. 
Krystal was trying to get up. Tsuki let out a small giggle.

      &quot;Maybe, but just not too much. Hoshi says the master wants her in tip top condition, 
but she&#39;s obviously not a virgin.&quot; Hina smiled at her sister and walked over to Krystal.

      &quot;Look, she&#39;s starting to wake up...&quot; Hina murmured, leaning over the older woman. 
Tsuki finished up with the circle and also went over.

      &quot;Hmm, yeah, but she&#39;s still weak,&quot; Tsuki said, helping Krystal up to a sitting 
position. With a grin, Hina tied her up in spirit threads again.

      &quot;Now we can have some fun.&quot; Krystal tried to struggle, but her body was aching and the 
threads were keeping her immobile. She let out a small cry as Hina&#39;s wandering hands grabbed 
a breast. &quot;They&#39;re so soft...&quot;

      &quot;Are they?&quot; Tsuki asked, nuzzling into Krystal&#39;s neck. As she felt the brunette&#39;s 
kisses against her neck, a sick feeling welled up in Krystal&#39;s chest.

      This couldn&#39;t really be happening - the girls she&#39;d been training with couldn&#39;t really 
be lusting over her and now violating her. Hina soon tired of her clothed chest and let her 
hand instead go under Krystal&#39;s shirt.

      &quot;Stop it!&quot; Her yell went unheeded as the two girls tried to seek out more of Krystal&#39;s 
body. They both froze upon the jingling sound in the doorway. Hoshi, now fully dressed in 
her exorcist outfit, was holding her staff.

      &quot;B-big sister,&quot; Tsuki stuttered out. &quot;We were... we just wanted a taste...&quot;

      &quot;Yeah! And... and the master isn&#39;t going to know since she&#39;s already given her body to 
someone else,&quot; Hina added.

      &quot;You two are such bad girls... I may have to punish you later, but...&quot; Hoshi set down 
her staff, much to Krystal&#39;s dismay and came closer. &quot;She&#39;s been so tempting ever since she 
walked into our shrine, hasn&#39;t she? Krystal, you shouldn&#39;t have been such a tease.&quot;

      The silver haired woman kneeled down closer to her. &quot;I&#39;ve waited a long time for 
this...&quot; Tsuki and Hina moved away, leaving Krystal tied up and at the mercy of their 
sister.

      Hoshi ran a hand through her blonde hair before forcefully kissing Krystal on the 
lips. She tried to struggle, thinking only of Isaka and how she wanted this to stop. Hoshi&#39;s 
hands began to wander around and Krystal struggled anew as the silver haired woman tried to 
unbutton her jeans. Hoshi pulled away from her lips and let out a frustrated sigh at 
Krystal&#39;s clamped legs.

      &quot;You can&#39;t have that,&quot; Krystal said, giving her a defiant look.

      &quot;Oh, not even one touch?&quot; Hoshi teased, her voice adopting a lustful tone. &quot;Just one 
little taste of such a sweet girl like you... a delicious girl.&quot;

      Krystal let out a yell as Tsuki and Hina began to work on getting her pants off. &quot;Such 
cute underwear!&quot; Hina squealed out.

      Tsuki started to fiddle with the waistband. &quot;But what lies beneath it is probably 
cuter.&quot;

      Krystal felt tears stream down her face out of embarrassment. This couldn&#39;t really be 
happening to her, could it? Hoshi kissed away her tears and looked down at the underwear in 
appreciation. Krystal let out a sob and Hoshi got off of her.

      &quot;That&#39;s enough - she&#39;s reserved for the master,&quot; Hoshi said, smiling.

      &quot;What?&quot; Tsuki said. &quot;We can&#39;t even touch her?&quot;

      &quot;I know the master wouldn&#39;t mind,&quot; Hina whined out. &quot;Just a little tiny taste! She&#39;s 
probably super yummy!&quot;

      Krystal couldn&#39;t believe they were talking about her like... like she was some treat 
or a prize. &quot;Now, now... Hina, I can take care of you later. Krystal belongs to the master 
and... well... maybe later we&#39;ll get a chance to play with her,&quot; Hoshi murmured, looking 
over at Krystal with a smile.

      Tsuki started to pull up Krystal&#39;s pants, purposefully touching her inappropriately 
along the way.

      &quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot; Krystal cried out, still tied up. Tsuki and her 
sisters stepped outside of the circle. It began to glow and Krystal felt something strange 
come over her. Hina&#39;s spirit threads dissipated and she realized that it was a binding seal.

      Her limbs were heavy and the room spun as she sat up. Krystal knew that she was 
trapped.

      &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Hoshi said. &quot;We promised we would explain it to you, didn&#39;t we?&quot; 

***** 

      Bakra let a small sigh pass through his lips. It had been a long time since Ark and 
Mara died, but he still couldn&#39;t get used to traveling by himself. Having a human lover was 
hard - much harder than he wished it would have been. As he walked through the field, 
something began to glow in his pocket. It was a piece of that red jewel Mara had gotten so 
long ago.

      Was Tsuru nearby? He smiled at the thought, hoping to catch up with her. At least 
having a friend around would be good... how was she doing these days? The jewel began to 
glow longer until he found himself in a field of flowers, soft humming reaching his ears. A 
girl was sitting down, collecting flowers for a bouquet. She looked up as he stepped closer.

      It definitely wasn&#39;t Tsuru, but the red jewel around her neck was glowing all the 
same. &quot;Uh, hello,&quot; he said awkwardly.

      The girl gave him a suspicious look but said, &quot;Hi.&quot;

      &quot;Er, you wouldn&#39;t happen to know a girl named Tsuru, would you?&quot; Bakra asked and the 
girl perked up at the name.

      &quot;Tsuru? Yes, I know Tsuru! She&#39;s a good friend of mine - have you seen her recently? 
She said she was going to come visit me this week...&quot; Tycara murmured out, standing up.

      &quot;No, I haven&#39;t seen her, but I&#39;ve been hoping too. Is it alright if I stick around for 
her?&quot; Tycara nodded before introducing herself and Bakra did the same. They walked for a 
while, discussing this and that, when Bakra felt a strange presence. He instinctively placed 
himself in front of Tycara and drew his sword.

      It wasn&#39;t long until weapons shot out at him. Bakra slashed at them, watching as they 
retracted to their owner... There were spirit threads attached to the knives, which would 
explain how they were being manipulated.

      &quot;Excuse me!&quot; The blonde girl called out, brandishing more throwing weapons. &quot;Could you 
hand over that girl?&quot;

      Bakra let out a snort. &quot;Right... like hell I am! What are you - some sort of 
exorcist?&quot; The girl grinned and threw more weapons.

      He grabbed Tycara and jumped away, holding the young hybrid close to his chest. 
&quot;Tycara, do you know that girl?&quot;

      &quot;No... I don&#39;t know why anyone would be after me anyway!&quot; Tycara said, a little bit 
frightened. She began to summon her own weapons, now having control over them thanks to 
Isaka.

      Hina frowned at the opposition and without warning, a flurry of weapons were shot at 
the pair. Bakra and Tycara did their best, but the male demon didn&#39;t hesitate to get a few 
nicks and scrapes for the girl.

      Just when he thought they were out of danger, he noticed a light forming beneath them. 
&quot;Banishing Art: Light Pillar!&quot;

      Bakra and Tycara exchanged looks as the ground beneath them blew up in light. He was 
thrown across the field, but Tycara regained her balance and sent her blades out at the 
newcomer. Unfortunately, she left herself vulnerable to the spirit threads. Tycara let out a 
yell as Hina caught her and Tsuki easily evaded her attack.

      Bakra got to his feet and ran at both girls. Tsuki let out a sigh and the marks on her 
arm began to glow. &quot;I think you should keep out of this, demon,&quot; she said simply as 
different glyphs appeared around her. Bakra wasn&#39;t quite liking his odds... the girl didn&#39;t 
even recite and incantation.

      He rolled to the side as each of the glyphs started chasing after him, shooting holy 
energy the whole time. The two girls laughed at his antics and Bakra let out a groan after 
being hit multiple times.

      As he fell to his knees, the two girls escaped with Tycara in tow. &quot;Go get Isaka,&quot; she 
shrieked out. &quot;Please!&quot;

      Bakra struggled to his feet. Isaka? Looks like Tycara had more than one mutual 
friend... 

***** 

      &quot;What? Exorcists carried her off?!&quot; Isaka looked horrified as she treated his wounds.

      &quot;I don&#39;t think they were real exorcists since they came specifically for Tycara... if 
they were, I&#39;m sure they would have killed us both,&quot; Bakra said, wincing at the pain.

      &quot;That&#39;s not good... Tycara isn&#39;t a demon - she&#39;s half angel, half demon,&quot; Isaka bit 
her lip. &quot;They probably want something from her because of her heritage...&quot;

      Bakra frowned and put his shirt on. &quot;Yeah, but I don&#39;t think the two of us can handle 
it on our own. Me and Tycara were caught off guard, but even then we should have put up a 
good fight.&quot;

      &quot;Then what do you think we should do? Who else can we-&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru&#39;s coming to visit Tycara, isn&#39;t she? Shouldn&#39;t we wait for her?&quot; Bakra watched 
as Isaka sighed.

      &quot;Yeah, but Tsuru... okay I kind of wronged her a while ago and every time she comes to 
visit we argue and have a physical confrontation until Tycara stops us.&quot;

      Bakra sighed and ruffled his hair. &quot;So I figured. But Tsuru&#39;s not a fool. She&#39;d be 
willing to help us save Tycara, especially since I will be here as well. You know she&#39;s 
exceptionally powerful.&quot;

      Isaka plopped down in her seat. &quot;Fine. She&#39;s supposed to be here by sundown, according 
to her letter.&quot;

  The sun hadn&#39;t even dipped below the horizon when Tsuru came in through the door, out of 
breath and distraught. She didn&#39;t even seem to be in the mood to be mad at Isaka. &quot;Carmilla 
found me again, but I was able to run away,&quot; she huffed out before noticing Bakra. &quot;Bakra? 
What are you doing here?&quot;

      After a quick explanation from the two demons, Tsuru proceeded to freak out. 
&quot;Exorcists? They kidnapped her?! We have to go after her - just imagine what could... Ah!&quot; 
Tsuru started to readjust her armor and check her weapons.

      Bakra exchanged looks with Isaka before saying, &quot;Let&#39;s go - we&#39;ve wasted enough time.&quot; 
Isaka was happy to not be in an argument with Tsuru so the trio left the house, trying to 
track down Tycara with the help of the red jewel.

      Bakra let out a sigh at the sounds of quiet bickering behind him. It was escalating a 
bit, with Tsuru and Isaka clearly arguing over something. At least he was getting a strong 
resonation from the jewel... so maybe they could locate Tycara soon.

      It was then that a sweet voice drifted across the filed. &quot;My knight!&quot;

      Tsuru tensed up as a shadow beast appeared behind them, Carmilla lounging on its head. 
&quot;I missed you - why did you run off so fast?&quot;

      &quot;Carmilla, I don&#39;t have time for your antics, I really have to go,&quot; Tsuru said, 
picking up her pace. Isaka was resisting the urge to laugh.

      &quot;But Tsuru, I&#39;ve been chasing you for the last month!&quot; Carmilla jumped off the shadow 
beat and moved quickly to latch onto her &#39;knight&#39;. &quot;Why won&#39;t you come back home with 
me...?&quot;

      &quot;Because I&#39;m not your damn knight! And I don&#39;t want to go settle down in some weird 
place,&quot; Tsuru said, trying to free herself. Bakra didn&#39;t know why she was complaining - if 
he had hot men all over him, he would definitely go for it. Ark&#39;s dying wish was for him to 
find someone else...

      &quot;Oh, but then we could travel together...&quot; Carmilla whispered before recognizing 
Isaka. &quot;You! You demon whore - you&#39;re the one that corrupted my precious Tsuru!&quot;

      &quot;Wh... whore?! At least I don&#39;t go around turning poor innocent girls! Shoot, if you 
hadn&#39;t bit her, this wouldn&#39;t have happened,&quot; Isaka retorted. &quot;And Tsuru willingly gave in 
to me-&quot;

      &quot;I did not! You took advantage of me and my feelings!&quot; Tsuru shot back, glaring at the 
demon.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright Tsuru, let me take you away from this horrid demon,&quot; Carmilla said, 
pressing herself against Tsuru suggestively.

      Bakra cleared his throat quite loudly. &quot;As much as I like watching your stupid hate 
triangle, we have a girl to rescue.&quot;

      Carmilla perked up at that. &quot;A girl to rescue?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s  a very good friend of mine,&quot; Tsuru said. Carmilla grabbed her arm 
tighter.

      &quot;Then I will help you!&quot; The vampire gave Tsuru a gentle smile. &quot;As your master I will 
help you rescue your friend.&quot;

      Bakra continued walking as the arguments ensued. Really, they didn&#39;t have time for 
this. 

***** 

      Tycara tried to struggle against the spirit threads, but they only sank into her skin. 
She didn&#39;t like this... not one bit. &quot;How is she doing?&quot; came a silky voice.

      &quot;She&#39;s doing great, big sister,&quot; Hina replied.

      Tsuki nodded as well. &quot;Yes, in no time at all, we should be able to bring back the 
master.&quot;

      Tycara tried to struggle again. &quot;What are you going to do to me?&quot;

      The three sisters laughed, until a sound caught their ears. The necklace around 
Tycara&#39;s neck was glowing furiously. Hoshi let out a sigh and turned to her sister. &quot;Would 
you take care of our guests? I will try to bring back our master.&quot;

      With that, the two younger sisters left to take care of the newcomers.
