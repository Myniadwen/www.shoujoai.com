<p>“Haunted Dauntless: unwelcome visitors from  beyond the grave!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fuuka smiled as she traced her finger over Athena’s  bare back. “Don’t look so depressed, sweetheart. It was only a  hunk of metal. I’m not mad at you for breaking it— I’m just  glad you were able to use it. Morisato was happy to be in your care.  I promise we’ll find you a new sword once we finish our business on  Shana’s world.”</p>
<p>“Mmnh,” she sighed. Fuuka’s touch was gentle and  erotic; it loosened Athena’s steely muscles and agitated nerves,  until she was soft and supple. Fuuka slowly leaned in to give her  shoulders a breathy kiss.</p>
<p>“Is that apathy I sense from you, or contentment?”</p>
<p>“Both, I think,” she murmured. “I’m not nearly  as stricken now that you’ve recovered. As long as you’re in good  health and we can share our lives together, nothing else really  matters.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what that man is doing here,” Fuuka  thought aloud. She leaned over, gradually covering Athena’s body  with her own, feeling warmth and prickly sensuality enter through her  skin, easing her cares. “He scares me, Athena. It’s like he can  see through us.”</p>
<p>“We have nothing to hide,” she assured her, falling  deeper into comfortable slumber. Athena revolved halfway so she could  see her lover, and gave her a husky smile. “He frightens me, too.  But I think we have more important things to fear. Despite his  unsettling personality, I get the feeling the Pendragon is really on  our side.”</p>
<p>“Could’ve fooled me,” Fuuka sighed. “I  overheard him saying he would’ve killed at least a third of our  crew if he had the authority. Amy’s had to play the mediator ever  since he arrived. I never imagined she’d know such a barbaric  person.”</p>
<p>“Barbaric according to our time, not his,” she  reminded her.</p>
<p>“I know. I should know better. Still, just being  around him makes my fur stand on end.” Athena smiled softly and  caressed Fuuka’s face. She was about to bring her in for a kiss,  when the ship noticeably came to a halt, and most of the power with  it. With the artificial gravity gone, objects once pinned down by  this terrestrial force began to loosen their bonds and float,  including both women and the sheets covering them. It would’ve been  very enamoring with the lights out and the gravity off, but for the  suddenness of it all. Eerie red auxiliary bulbs flickered to life,  and the two broke free from their stupor and felt around for their  clothes.</p>
<p>“Always an interruption,” Athena sighed.</p>
<p>“Ssh. Let’s check it out. There could be trouble.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. You check the bridge while I go to the kitchen.  I can use a knife at least.”</p>
<p>“You’re so paranoid,” Fuuka said lightly. Their  hands brushed against each other before the lovers parted.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The Dauntless was downright morbid with only emergency  lights on— and with the artificial gravity temporarily out of  commission, floating through her corridors felt like swimming through  hellish waters. The muffled chorus of complaints, curses, and wails  made everything seem even more like an inferno of damnation. The  situation was hopeless. They were out in the middle of empty space,  with the closest planet several light years away, and the closest  port further still. The Pendragon was calm but very alert, like a  cougar studying something possibly more dangerous than itself. The  Acherons were busy trying to revive the ship, while Eve and her crew  blindly wandered around the engine room, brandishing flashlights like  they were swords.</p>
<p>“Welp, I’m stumped,” Kyrie admitted as she closed  a hatch. “This ship’s in shape, and then some. I don’t know  what to tell you, but it just stopped all of a sudden, and there  isn’t anything here to tell us why.”</p>
<p>“When you think about it, we really don’t know very  much about this thing at all,” Herut said as she caressed a curving  support beam. “Amy said it came from another galaxy, but who built  it, and how long ago? For what purpose, and how did it come here—  and how did <em>she</em> come to get it? Very strange.”</p>
<p>“And yet we can work on it as if it were one of our  own,” Eve murmured. She took a deep breath and tethered herself to  the floor. “Herut, you and Mink continue to monitor the power  supply. Becky, you and Kyrie go around and see if you can’t find  anything we might have overlooked. Call us if anything happens, you  two.”</p>
<p>“Mushrooms,” called a sharp voice from outside. It  was Valti. She looked pleased with herself and, appropriately enough,  was playing with a large mushroom she had swiped from the kitchen.</p>
<p>“What’s that?” Kyrie said. Valti took a bite.</p>
<p>“According to ancient manuscripts, the ancients  believed that mushrooms, and fungi in general, were just normal  plants. And you might think they are, at first glance. But they’re  an entirely different kingdom of living organisms, as far separated  from the plants as we are. It took scientists decades to really  classify and discern the differences, but even now, some people don’t  know about it.”</p>
<p>“You’re making me sick,” Herut grimaced. “I  hate mushrooms. What’s your point?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so picky! You’d eat them if you were  hungry enough.” To prove it, Valti devoured the whole thing,  licking three of her fingers. She grinned and pointed to the darkness  outside, which had gone completely silent since her arrival. “You  hear that?”</p>
<p>“Hear what?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” she said, eyes flickering. Eve rolled  her eyes.</p>
<p>“Go back to your lab, professor, and lock the door  while you’re at it.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean <em>Nothing</em>. I don’t mean you can’t  hear ‘anything’: you hear the Nothing.” She emphasized the word  so formally that it made everyone in the engine room pay closer  attention. Valti was a lot like the <em>Daunltess</em>: unpredictable,  mysterious, occasionally charismatic, even inviting, but ultimately a  force which no one understood and no one had any control over. And  they were both quite brimming with their own lives. Brignor turned to  face the darkness, her arms all at her side, motionless.</p>
<p>“Mushrooms,” she whispered again, as the stillness  in the ship became so thick, you could reach out and eat it. “They’re  not like anything else. You think they’re something when they’re  really not. Once I landed on a world that was covered with them:  molds, rusts, yeasts, and lichen, everywhere. It was beautiful, and  deadly. I’ll never forget that world. It was so different. It made  me rethink about the order of things.”</p>
<p>“No wonder you’re half-insane,” Eve surmised,  throwing her arms up in surrender. “You got mushroom poisoning and  now we’re all suffering the side effects.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen something like this before, just before  we reached the fungus world.” Valti definitely knew how to freeze  the conversation: they would certainly be hanging on her every word  now. Suddenly, a low, long groaning sound came up from the depths of  the darkness— from inside the ship, or outside, or perhaps from the  ship itself— a groaning not like an animal’s, but more primal and  painful, sinister and bleak, something from beyond the line between  what is real and what we can imagine.</p>
<p>One thing was for certain: it was very near and it was  getting closer.</p>
<p>“Right before the mushroom world,” Valti said in a  husky whisper. “Mushrooms aren’t like anything else. And neither  are they.”</p>
<p>“‘They’?” Rebecca echoed. “Valti…you’re  making less sense than usual.” Rebecca Hill knew what it was like  to be afraid, but she thought that all fears had left her when her  father lost his soul, and they had died completely when she came to  Venus. But now that familiar thrill of terror was welling up in her  chest again, like a cloud of smoke that drifts in slowly when the  mind’s senses are the weakest, to conquer through doubt,  uncertainty, and the wild questions we ask ourselves in the dark. She  could only <em>try</em> to be brave.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen this before,” Valti said, as the  groaning grew lower, and nearer. Mink’s hair stood on end as  whispers floated in the weightless breeze, voices which had no  origin, words with no meaning— most of the time.</p>
<p><em>Last one to…don’t say…up there…me and the  others…you already…where’s the…</em></p>
<p>“They’re just like mushrooms. You think you know  what they are, but you’re wrong. They’re different.”</p>
<p><em>Have the one with…down below we…breaking  after…tomorrow’s…it’s going to…will have you…</em></p>
<p>“I’ve seen them before. They’re different.”</p>
<p>“Valti,” Kyrie said shakily, “what <em>are</em>…they?”  Brignor turned around to face her, a calm expression on her face.</p>
<p>“They’re different. And they’re here.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>After living on Alfheim and exploring most of the  civilized galaxy, Aseria thought she had grown past childish fears  and surprises. Sindar were still sensitive to the unnatural  phenomenon that sometimes reveals itself in isolated pockets of  space, but as impartial observers and not participants stricken with  masochistic curiosity. Her ebony skin turned a frightening shade of  pale gray, and her ears twitched as she, too, heard the voices, and  the groaning, and sensed that whatever had caused the <em>Dauntless </em>to  stop like that was soon going to visit them. She tried regaining her  senses by rubbing her face and searching for Lillianne. Lillianne  would help. She had lived through several bizarre experiences before—  surely even something of this nature. But she dared not call out for  her, not even for security, lest she draw the visitors’ attention.</p>
<p>Wide-eyed she wandered through the black hallways,  sometimes guided by the red lights, sometimes by shifting bodies she  believed were her comrades. She spotted a dark shape moving, its  crimson shadow dancing, and ran to catch up with it, only to find an  empty hallway. A faint breeze touched her neck, and she turned to  face total emptiness, a void opening its mouth to devour her.  Somewhere in the stillness she heard a quick, sharp laugher, and her  blood froze to ice as something spoke to her, a voice so near she  could feel the chill on her skin.</p>
<p><em>Will kill you.</em></p>
<p>Aseria bolted away, wandering blindly in the murk,  lights flickering off all around her as some malicious entity  silenced her only hope. Now there was only light enough to make out  those dark shapes that played tricks on her, moving shadows at the  corner of her eye, a something standing before her, gone when she  blinked breathless, a cold chill crawling up her spine to touch her—</p>
<p>“WAAH!!”</p>
<p>“Jeez, don’t scream so loud! It’s only me!”  Aseria squinted in the painful light and hit Valti on the head. Her  heart was racing wildly and there was sweat glistening in the sullen  glow of the lantern.</p>
<p>“Shit, you almost scared me to death! What the hell’s  wrong with you, creeping around the dark like that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, so it’s my fault we can’t see anything?  Look, I’m sorry, but something really weird’s going on here.”</p>
<p>“Really now! Did you finally get out from underneath  your rock, or are you just slow?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that. Look, some of us are trying to  herd everyone together in the meeting room. At least if we’re all  in the same place, we won’t have to worry about…” Valti trailed  off long enough for Aseria’s anger to rise, and she grabbed the  six-armed woman firmly.</p>
<p>“Worry about what? If this is your idea of a sick  prank, then I know someone who can get rid of all those extra arms  for you real quick!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Aseria Tolan,” Valti stated, almost  sounding like her father. “It’s best if you come with me, and  hold my hand. This darkness is unnatural. It’ll steal you away if  you’re not careful.”</p>
<p>“What in the Eldar’s name are you— ” Valti  quickly covered Aseria’s mouth and held onto her tight. Aseria was  more powerful, but not even she could break free with five arms  circled around her body. As she was about to bite down on the hand  covering her mouth, her eyes flashed open and her skin became glacial  as she saw, very distinctly, a shape moving before her, lanky and  without discernable form. It reminded her of the humming form that  Rachel had assumed early in the voyage, when nobody knew of Dr.  Miracle’s true identity. As the shape dissipated into the darkened  wall, Aseria gradually calmed down and felt herself loosen like a  cooked noodle in Valti’s arms.</p>
<p>“I know,” she said empathetically. “I’ve seen  them before. They’re not what you think, either— and it’s not  Rachel. Come on, hurry up. And hold on tight. I already lost two  people and I don’t mean to lose another.” Aseria had loads of  questions, but was too fearful to say anything, or to even make a  sound. She held onto Valti like a security blanket and didn’t let  go until she was thrust into the meeting room where a dozen jilted  women took her into their care.</p>
<p>“Put that thing away!” she heard Fuuka hiss.  “You’re liable to hurt someone with it! Anyway, you can’t use  knives against ghosts.”</p>
<p>“Ghosts!?” Allegra shrieked.</p>
<p>“No!” Valti exclaimed, as softly as she could.  “These aren’t ghosts. They’re…well, it’s hard to explain  right now. But stay in here and stay together! I’m going to find  more people.”</p>
<p>“You owe us one hell of an explanation!” Kate  shouted. Valti closed the door behind her and peered into the void.  She shook the flashlight until it sputtered out more light, but a  sudden breeze snuffed out the glare, and a fierce shock knocked the  tool out of her hand. She could not see her attacker, but she could  feel it pass as she stood motionless. Once the coast was clear, she  picked up her flashlight again, flicked it on, and went in search of  the others.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Well, they’re not djinn, Master, of that I’m  certain.”</p>
<p>“Of course they’re not,” Amy said with a smile.  “You’re the last of their kind.”</p>
<p>“Not…exactly,” Rachel said gingerly. “But it’s  not a djinn out there. I’m embarrassed to say this, Master, but I  don’t know what else it is. They’re not animal, vegetable,  mineral, or incorporeal. It feels like this is a creature that fits  somewhere on that fine line between physical and spiritual. In other  words, they’re not eldil like you thought, either.”</p>
<p>“That’s a relief,” she whispered. “The good  ones are always accompanied by extraordinary sensory impulses and the  wicked ones are much less subtle. I was afraid we were in trouble for  a minute— well, <em>real</em> trouble in any case. I don’t know if  we’re any better off. The Pendragon might know, though. Do you know  where he is?”</p>
<p>“Another presence I can’t understand,” Rachel  replied. “If I knew, I would’ve led you to him by now. I haven’t  felt the slightest tremor.” Amy took a moment to look into the dark  and clutch her walking stick. She caressed the tip and chewed her lip  as blood trickled out her bandages.</p>
<p>“Whatever’s out there, I am not afraid of it. I can  only hope it does nothing worse than kill me. However, we can’t  just hide here. We have to find the— ”</p>
<p><em>Watch as the…there’s another…down there…see  the…lift you where…on the…don’t understand where…</em></p>
<p>“We have to find the others,” she said thickly,  swallowing. “I’m guessing they’re trying to gather together  somewhere. Let’s start looking.”</p>
<p>“It’s not safe for you to be walking blindly,  Master. Even if you didn’t have a bad foot.”</p>
<p>“But ‘even though I walk through the valley of the  shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for my rod and my staff protect  me’— and my genie friend.” Only Rachel could see Amy smile in  this pitch blackness, so they held hands and plunged into the deep.  There came a groaning sound a few steps further in, and much louder  whispers originating from what Amy believed to be the exercise room.  Some maniacal compulsion made her peer through the doors to see what  was there, and she gave a shriek and fell back as a face emerged to  stare back. Rachel looked down at her fallen master, confused.</p>
<p>“You said you weren’t afraid of anything.”</p>
<p>“Uh…I’m not. I’m just startled, that’s all.”  And in spite of their surroundings and the situation, both of them  laughed out loud. A much more foreboding feeling came from the baths,  almost as if a cloudy, inky creature was waiting for them inside,  seducing anything that came close. Amy stood paralyzed and whispered  something as she walked past the doors, shutting her eyes and her  ears, marching fiercely and putting great pressure on her wound. The  blood flowed well and her physical pain outmatched her emotional  dread.</p>
<p>“Well, that was reckless,” she gasped once she had  crossed. Rachel smiled sadly and scooped her up in her arms. As she  stood, she let out a scream as she saw something glaring at her, and  almost dropped her master. Amy stumbled but caught herself just in  time to smile.</p>
<p>“Lord Pendragon,” she addressed, “you startled  us.” The duo suddenly laughed again, puzzling the ancient wizard.  They recovered soon enough. “Would you know what is going on, Oris?  It is something neither of us have seen. They are neither djinn,  eldil, nor any physical being.”</p>
<p>“Deep Heaven holds many secrets in her uncharted  pockets,” he replied, rubbing his beard carefully. “Perhaps we  have come to something that may challenge my own knowledge. Let us  investigate further.” He approached the baths, steadfast and proud,  and flung open the doors with a single mighty wave. Tendrils of black  smog, darker than the depths of the shadowy ship, reached out to  ensnare and surround the Pendragon, but his eyes were dull and  careful, meticulously staring into the void even as his body was  cloaked.</p>
<p>“Begone,” he finally said, waving the smoke away.  The fog lifted and real glorious electric lights came back on, but  only in the baths. An entity scrambled out of the room and made its  way into a corridor, where it was lost. Oris followed it at a kingly  pace.</p>
<p>“Lord Pendragon, what was that?” Amy said.</p>
<p>“I am headed to the observation deck. You may  accompany me or cloister yourselves in the meeting hall with the  others. …Wait. …A forked tongue will lead to a forked road. All  paths to her will be as a prison. Even the raven has the right to  song.” He marched on, heedless of their reaction or condition,  leaving confusion in his wake.</p>
<p>“Sounds like another prophecy,” Rachel assumed. Amy  nodded, and decided to head into the meeting room, if only to see who  else was there. Along the way, she spotted an aura of strange light,  and approached it hastily, spilling the essence of her life  everywhere. If you wander through the desert, you will fling yourself  hopelessly to water; a prisoner welcomes the free world with a song;  the cold seek fire and the poor seek security, and so too was it  Miracle with her light. But she had to take off her glasses to make  sure she wasn’t seeing anything.</p>
<p>Out there in the sea of glittering stars was a dark  form, eclipsing the light.</p>
<p>The form of a derelict ghost ship and her crew of the  damned.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>As she tried to rescue her crewmembers and seclude them  together in the meeting room, Valti Brignor kept coming back to those  two she had lost. One of them was Riene; she had discovered her  shortly after evacuating Eve’s crew, bent over clutching her head,  muttering about strange visions. She was in the lower decks, where  some of the provisions were kept, imprisoned by a circle of red  emergency lights. Valti was forced to carry her, but the power was  lost and she had to climb the stairs in total darkness. At the fifth  step, as she neared the top, she felt something cold and heavy reach  out to touch her foot. Panicking, she kicked at it, lost her balance,  and fell backwards. She caught herself with one of her spare arms,  and fell atop a sack of flour that she swore hadn’t been there  before— perhaps another part of this strange joke— but when she  stood up, Riene was completely gone. Valti believed she had fallen  underneath the stairs, into a black region where no light reaches,  but was not able to prove this. Rebecca would never forgive her until  Riene was found.</p>
<p>The other was Yenae. She lost her in the baths:  whatever creature had inhabited them during the invasion had snatched  her away into the murky depths, and had repulsed Valti with a strong  wave of inky wind. Brignor was forced to search for the others but  now she wanted to return to these places. First, she made sure not to  worry Alala, which was practically impossible now that the Felinis  had finally accepted Yenae’s feelings.</p>
<p>“That damned demon’s always getting herself into  trouble,” she muttered, wiping tears from her eyes. “Makes sense  that she got caught by some…by some whatever the hell this is.”</p>
<p>“Amy said she saw a ghost ship hovering outside,”  Lyara said. “A few of the others are saying the same thing.”  Allegra chimed in.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it looked like one o’ them ol’ sailing  boats that people used a thousand years ago on Earth.”</p>
<p>“It could be the Lord Barbarossa we encountered,”  Sharyn suggested.</p>
<p>“No, <em>The Flying Dutchman</em> was in pristine  condition. That one looked like it had been sitting in the ocean for  ages. That still doesn’t explain what these…things are.”</p>
<p>“I don’t give a rat’s ass!” Alala shouted. “I’m  gonna find Yenae and give her a whack on the head for causing all  this trouble!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that?” Valti said warily. “This  isn’t an ordinary occurrence. I know what to expect, but that  doesn’t mean anyone else has to risk their life.”</p>
<p>“If you know what to expect,” Alala said, digging  her finger in Valti’s forehead, “then anyone accompanying you  should be all right— right?!” Valti couldn’t deny that she had  a point, and since she figured Alala would wander around anyway, at  least if she invited her along, there would be less trouble— plus,  they could watch each other’s back. She got a gnawing sensation in  her stomach as she left the meeting room and heard someone call out:</p>
<p>“Has anyone seen Riene?”</p>
<p>“Let’s hurry,” Valti murmured, taking Alala’s  hand.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Fortunately, the monstrous presence she felt in the  baths was gone, and with it the darkness. Valti and Alala were  stunned to see all the lights back on— everything working fine  until they got to the hallway— and even more surprised when they  spotted Yenae lying on the floor, stretched out and lifeless, her  eyes glassy and drool trickling from her mouth. Her saliva was warm  and she had a pulse, but no amount of shouting and shaking could wake  her.</p>
<p>“Yenae! Yenae!! Come on, wake up, honey! I promise I  won’t get mad at you if you just wake up! Are you listening?! Snap  out of it! Yenae? Yenae!! God-damn it, Yenae, wake up! Please…”</p>
<p>“Think she’s in a coma?” Valti wondered. Alala  glared at her with watery eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about it! She’s a lot stronger  than that! Yenae said she’d always be with me…so she can’t be  lying. She can’t be!!” Alala wept helplessly for a few moments,  then slowly took a breath and composed herself. It was clear she had  an idea up her sleeve; she took Yenae’s hands and brought them up  to her chest, placing them upon her small, soft bosom. A low groaning  sound came from below.</p>
<p>“Mmm, boobies…”</p>
<p>“Yup, good as new,” Alala deadpanned. “Come on,  lazybones, get up. You worried me sick, you know.”</p>
<p>“I what?” she said groggily. “Can’t remember  much. Are we going to take a bath together?” Alala banged her head  against Yenae’s, glaring impatiently.</p>
<p>“Yeah, an ice-cold one to wake you up!”</p>
<p>“Heheheh…but you know what cold water does to you.”  Alala turned red all over, slapped her gently, and lifted her up.  Brignor saw them safely to the meeting room before searching for  Riene; however, her search was abbreviated as she heard something  shuffling behind her, something following very close, a curious  invisible force that sent chills through her veins. She didn’t dare  turn around but knew she had to. Something had penetrated the  darkness, and it was staring directly at her, two cold crystal eyes  hovering in the air. Valti thrust herself away as fast as the  artificial gravity would take her, but she felt the inky cold rush up  behind her, whispering fiercely, reaching out to engulf her and  absorb her into its black domain…</p>
<p>“Begone,” she heard a powerful voice say. At once  the patch of darkness fled, and light— blessed, beautiful electric  light— flickered on. Valti squinted and raised her arms to shield  herself.</p>
<p>“Oris Pendragon, I presume?” she groaned.</p>
<p>“A good presumption. I come bearing a gift.” He  thrust something warm, soft, and distinctly feminine in her arms: it  was Riene, and she was shaken and frightened, but more or less in  good shape. “She will regain her senses shortly. I had to wrest her  from a force which confounded me. Though I proved the stronger, its  mystery hounds me. So too shall no living being know all that is  placed under the Creator’s eye.”</p>
<p>“I know what it is,” Valti said as she helped guide  Riene to the meeting room. “I’ll explain it once everyone’s  together. I have something I need to ask Eve and Kyrie, as well.”</p>
<p>“Do you have knowledge of a remedy?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, but if I tell them what it is, they’ll hate  me for it. The solution is so simple, it’s insulting. I guess I can  get used to being a pariah.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Valti decided to make her explanation brief and direct;  she figured her crewmates deserved that at least. “It’s a species  of creatures called the Prism,” she announced, “or at least  that’s what we called them when I first ran into them. They’re  just like mushrooms, not at all like plants or animals, and they’re  not ghosts, either. The best comparison I can make is that they’re  sort of like living embodiments of light. They can manipulate the  light and show us all sorts of images.”</p>
<p>“Do you know how stupid that sounds?” the Acherons  balked. “If they were creatures made out of light, then why has the  ship gone dark?”</p>
<p>“Because they feed off the light. Ever notice how  sometimes your flashlight ran out of power all of a sudden, and then  came back on? There was nothing wrong with it: the Prism was just  eating it.”</p>
<p>“That’s a little disturbing,” Chandra shuddered.  “Are you sure they aren’t ghosts? They’re awfully frightening.”</p>
<p>“It’s just an illusion. The ship outside, those  shapes we’ve been seeing…all a trick of the light, or rather,  light manipulation. The Prism have no real form, just like regular  light. All they really do is eat and cast false projections. That’s  why nobody’s gotten hurt: they’ve just been scared stiff by the  images.”</p>
<p>“All right, so how do we get rid of them?  Starvation?”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly right!” she exclaimed with a loud  clap. “That is exactly how the Prism are exterminated! When I first  ran into them, we noticed something very strange about the ship’s  power. Even though it appeared as if all the lights were off, when we  checked the breakers, everything was fine. Kyrie, Eve, you found the  same results, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it…” Kyrie grunted. “So…are  you saying…those lights aren’t really <em>off</em>, they’re just  being…eaten?”</p>
<p>“That is exactly what I’m saying. Those lights are  still on. That’s why some of the emergency lights aren’t working,  either. Turn off everything except for life support and the Prism  won’t have anything to eat. They’ll go away and we’ll be back  on our voyage.”</p>
<p>“I guess that sounds reasonable,” Herut admitted.  “But what about the artificial gravity going off? Explain that!”</p>
<p>“Um, that was me,” Chandra muttered bashfully, as  she raised her hand. “I sort of…messed around with it. Naja  wanted to try zero-gravity sex.” The poor Elshyrin felt everyone’s  glares and held up her arms in defense.</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t look at me! I couldn’t fix the damned  thing in the dark!”</p>
<p>“Look, let’s not go pointing fingers,” Kyrie  grumbled. “First let’s turn off all the power and see what  happens. I’ll fix the gravity once these Prism thingies are gone.”</p>
<p>“There are five different power generators on the  ship,” Shana said. “I know where they all are, so I can direct  everyone. There should also be a master override in the bridge  somewhere.”</p>
<p>“We’re on it,” the Acherons said as they floated  away. Shana went with them and everyone passed radios around so they  could keep in contact. After spending many months aboard the ship,  nearly to the point where they could call it their home, the crew had  little difficulty in navigating through her halls, even in total  darkness. The Prism were still frightening, but knowing what they  were made the fear less concerning. One by one, they reached the  generators and shut off all power, except for life-support. Just as  Valti said, it didn’t take long for the entities to leave the ship—  Oris spotted them filing out like wisps of cloud through the  ventilation shafts and airlocks. The image of a ghost ship faded,  briefly turning into a living rainbow before it was lost in the  depths of space, forced to find a new location to lie in wait. Once  everyone was certain their unwanted guests had left, power was  restored, and with it, the life of normality everyone had grown  accustomed to.</p>
<p>“I still can’t understand the noises, though,”  Athena said to her lover as they sat together, in blinding light,  naked and ready for sex. They spared no expense in lighting the room  and even had several candles decorating the place. “Logically, a  being that is made of light couldn’t possibly make any sound.”</p>
<p>“They’re gone now,” Fuuka smiled. “That’s all  that matters, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“I suppose,” she smirked. “Still, it’s  unsettling how much we really don’t know about this galaxy of ours,  even after eons of explorations. …Enough with that; I’m just glad  we’re safe. But really, darling— do we need <em>all</em> of these  lights?”</p>
<p>Fuuka purred lustfully as everything was extinguished  save for the passion of candles.</p>

<p>With that debacle over, more mundane concerns fell into  Valti’s thoughts— concerns that maybe the Acherons could become  two instead of one, that the Pendragon would end up killing them all,  that people like the Jackal and Changera were still after them, that  she would grow distant from Rebecca, that she would face loneliness  at the end of this journey. But all in good time, one trouble at a  time. After showering and drying off, Valti hunted through her ice  box for a snack, and pulled out a pint of ice cream she had been  saving. Now was as good a victory as any to savor this. Before  digging in, her eyes happened to glance at the daily calendar she  kept up, and she felt a chill run through her body.</p>

<p>April first.</p>
<p>Gotcha!!</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Rachel: Truth is elusive. Truth is many things. One  person’s truth is another’s lie. The purpose of a journey is to  find truth— to find answers to life’s questions— but when those  answers are revealed, does that mean that life has come to an end?  Fortunately, in the next chapter, the crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> does not have all of their burning questions answered, because if  they did, I’m sure it’d be the end of their voyage. Still, we’ve  come this far, so I’m sure a few answers are in order. Of course,  there is such a thing as an answer that leads to <em>more</em> questions, but let’s not worry about that right now. Let’s just  say that in the next chapter, we find out some things that have been  on our minds for a long time, so please watch out for it. You may  find that the end of one journey leads to many others. Oh, and I  can’t let you know the title of the next chapter. Sorry about that.</p>
