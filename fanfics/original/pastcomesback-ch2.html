<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 2 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>      In a place not too far away, a young goddess was on the phone and at the same time 
doing a crossword puzzle. &quot;Krystal? Oh, yeah, it&#39;s Erin. I&#39;m not interrupting you, am I?&quot;

      The exorcist assured she wasn&#39;t so the young woman continued. &quot;We&#39;re all going over to 
Abby and Sakura&#39;s place for a bit of a dinner party, maybe even a sleepover. Can you and 
Isaka come?&quot;

      Erin could hear a rustling over the phone and the murmur of the voices of her two 
friends. Speaking of rustling... The dark green hair girl looked down the hallway of the 
place she shared with Faye to see her lover changing the sheets.

      Her red hair was down and spilling over the freshly clean linen she was spreading over 
the enormous mattress they called a bed. Then she blushed because she knew why they had to 
change the sheets today.

      &quot;Huh, oh - you can come? Haha, just making sure. That&#39;s great. Yeah, things are good 
with us,&quot; Erin looked back over at Faye to see the Goddess of Love sitting on top of the bed 
and shooting her a knowing look. She smiled to herself and continued her conversation with 
Krystal.

      &quot;...well there actually is another reason besides getting together to have fun. Abby 
and Sakura are both pretty bashful - yeah, Abby doesn&#39;t seem like it, I know - but they&#39;re 
having a hard time with Eveon growing up.&quot;

      There was a long pause as Krystal picked up on what Erin was saying. &quot;Yeah,&quot; the 
goddess said. &quot;Eveon&#39;s going to be 16 and they haven&#39;t given her the talk yet... I know, I 
know! If I had lesbian mothers, I figured they would have given me great advice... mmhmm... 
I&#39;m glad they&#39;re together though. I&#39;m sure Tycara must enjoy having two loving mommies. 
Haha...&quot;

      As she was continuing her conversation with Krystal, Erin felt a pair of hands lightly 
fall on her shoulders, before moving down and lightly roping around her neck. &quot;Hey, Krystal? 
I think I have to go... yeah... haha, you too? Well Isaka is a bit insistent.&quot; Erin could 
hear a response from Isaka over the phone. &quot;Yeah and - ah!&quot;

      Erin couldn&#39;t finish her sentence with Faye suckling at her neck. &quot;K-Krystal... 
yeah... Faye says hi... I&#39;ll have to call back with the exact date.&quot; She let her phone plunk 
on the table and dropped the pencil she&#39;d been using on the crossword.

      &quot;I think we need to break in the sheets,&quot; Faye said suggestively, having pulled back 
from Erin&#39;s neck. She massaged the snake goddess&#39;s shoulders, getting a happy sound from her 
lover. &quot;Of course, don&#39;t we always?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;So we get to give Eveon a little lesson in love?&quot; Krystal snuggled back into her 
lover. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said, answering her question. &quot;I can&#39;t believe Abby hasn&#39;t done it. I 
know Sakura is quiet, but both of them aren&#39;t shy about what they do.&quot;

      Isaka shrugged and held the blonde girl closer. &quot;I&#39;m surprised Tycara hasn&#39;t 
complained about it yet. She used to always be so bothered by me and my lesbian relations.&quot; 
Krystal laughed. &quot;Oh, she&#39;s probably too happy with her family to mind...&quot;

      The exorcist sat up and gave Isaka an appraising look. &quot;But... what lesbian relations? 
I never really asked you about this stuff. How many girls have you been with before me?&quot;

      The look on Isaka&#39;s face was priceless. She should have known this was going to 
happen. Of course Krystal was going to wonder how many girls she&#39;d screwed. &quot;Er... I&#39;d 
rather not say.&quot;

      Krystal frowned. &quot;You lost track, didn&#39;t you?&quot; The demon tried to give her a 
reassuring smile. &quot;Well, over a couple hundred years worth...&quot;

      Her lover didn&#39;t look so happy. &quot;What... what makes me so different?&quot; Krystal lied 
back down and looked over at the demon. &quot;What makes me different from all those girls you 
were with?&quot;

      Isaka racked her brain for the best answer. How was she supposed to know what to say? 
It just... it just was. &quot;I love you. That&#39;s the difference.&quot; She grabbed Krystal&#39;s hand and 
kissed the fingertips. She only got a sad smile.

      &quot;But I&#39;m getting older, Isaka. How do... how do I know you won&#39;t leave me? What will 
you do when I&#39;m old and no longer pretty? Will you still be here?&quot; Isaka had wondered about 
what she would do. Krystal was human and subject to age, unlike her. She wouldn&#39;t die for a 
long time, but Krystal... Krystal would only be around for so long.

      And she wouldn&#39;t always be the pretty young blonde she fell in love with. The demon 
felt something squeeze at her heart. When Krystal got older and stopped being so beautiful, 
what would she do? She wouldn&#39;t... she wouldn&#39;t really leave her, would she?

      The tense moment passed when Krystal&#39;s phone rang again. This time, Isaka didn&#39;t stop 
her from answering it. 

***** 

      Tsuru had been biting her nail as the phone rang and she nearly chomped off her thumb 
as Krystal&#39;s somber voice came over the phone. &quot;...hello?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, hi, Krystal! It&#39;s Tsuru, from today. I... I know it seems kind of odd to be 
calling so soon, but...&quot; She trailed off. She wanted to see the beautiful blonde girl again 
and talk to her.

      &quot;It&#39;s fine, don&#39;t worry. What&#39;s up?&quot; Tsuru let out a sigh of relief before saying, &quot;I 
know it sounds kind of silly, but I was going to go do some shopping in the mall area and I 
figured you probably live nearby too-&quot;

      &quot;Huh, the mall? Yeah, I know where that is. Do you want to meet up tomorrow?&quot; Krystal 
said and Tsuru smiled.

      &quot;Yeah. They&#39;re actually having a little market outside, with little stands set up and 
stuff. I thought it would be fun to walk around with someone,&quot; the light blue haired girl 
said, lying down on her couch.

      &quot;It does sound good... hmm, I&#39;ll text you back okay? I need to make sure I&#39;m not busy 
with anything else.&quot; Tsuru&#39;s mood sunk a bit. She just remembered that her crush had a 
girlfriend and going out with another girl may not go over so well. Crap. 

***** 

      Isaka was still thinking about what to say about their little predicament, but it 
could make or break their relationship. She watched her lover flip her phone close, letting 
every detail and contour of her back seep into her memory. She never wanted to leave 
Krystal, but what if she was right? What if time killed their love?

      She had initially loved Krystal for her body and then loved the rest of her. The demon 
started to fret on the inside. She didn&#39;t want this to end. Isaka was so... happy when she 
was with Krystal.

      &quot;Hey.&quot; Krystal still sounded quite sad. &quot;Can I go out with a friend tomorrow?&quot;

      A friend? &quot;Who is it?&quot; Isaka asked, sitting up.

      &quot;Oh, it&#39;s this girl I met today while fighting a shadow beast. She&#39;s actually an 
exorcist... or well she used to be.&quot; The demon felt a warning signal pop up. &quot;Is she into 
girls?&quot;

      Krystal nodded. &quot;Yeah, but she knows I&#39;m in a relationship. She just wanted to hang 
out and I&#39;m hoping that I can learn some more exorcist training from her.&quot;

      There was an awkward silence. Under any other circumstance, Isaka might have said no, 
or at the very least, go with her lover on her little outing. But Krystal... their 
relationship was rocky and the last thing she wanted to do was make it worse.

      &quot;Sure, go ahead. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have fun,&quot; Isaka said with a smile. Krystal nodded. 
&quot;Thanks.&quot; She looked over at the clock and realized it was still in the evening. &quot;I think 
I&#39;m going to make dinner.&quot; The blonde girl stood up and started to put on her clothes. Isaka 
watched all the while and eventually, her lover left the room. 

***** 

      &quot;So... you&#39;re having relationship issues?&quot; Seth took a sip of his soda, giving Isaka a 
side long glance. She knew he was getting a kick out of this. Probably his form of revenge 
for stealing his girlfriend. &quot;Whatever you do, Isaka... just don&#39;t break up with her because 
you think it&#39;s the best thing.&quot;

      Seth almost fell off of the patio he had been sitting off due to a shove by the demon. 
&quot;I&#39;m trying to spill my feelings to you here! Can&#39;t you just give me good advice, Mr. Man?&quot; 
He set down his can and shrugged.

      &quot;Look, I know you came to me because Erin and Faye are busy, Mina and Eveon can&#39;t help 
you out, Abby would make fun of you and Sakura would just give you a creepy look, and Tycara 
wouldn&#39;t want to listen, but I&#39;m not exactly tailored for this kind of thing. I&#39;ve known 
Krystal basically all my life.&quot;

      They were in Abby&#39;s backyard and Isaka looked up at the sky. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;m talking 
to you. You&#39;ve known her longer than me and I&#39;m not really sure what to do about her.&quot;

      Seth sighed. &quot;Isaka... I really do hope you would stay with her no matter what. I know 
it&#39;s hard not having the same lifespan, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get through it. I know that me 
and Tycara probably won&#39;t work out in the long run, or, well, I mean, I&#39;m going to die way 
before she does.&quot;

      The demon sighed and looked behind her. Through the glass doors, she could see the ten 
year old Tycara napping upon the Abby. The blonde woman was actually fast asleep on Sakura&#39;s 
lap. Isaka thought they were so lucky - neither of them would die unless the other did, so 
Sakura had in essence passed on her angelic lifespan to Abby.

      &quot;I will stay with her. So long as I love her, I will stay with her,&quot; Isaka said 
confidently. Seth frowned. &quot;You know, that wasn&#39;t really hard to figure out. I don&#39;t know 
why you were stressing. Krystal loves you a lot - that&#39;s why she&#39;s worried about your 
relationship ending. She doesn&#39;t want you to go.&quot;

      She ground her teeth. &quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m always afraid she&#39;ll find someone that will grow 
old with her or something...&quot; Seth laughed. &quot;Yeah, but if she leaves you for a guy, I will 
laaaaaauuuuugh...&quot; He got a punch in the arm for that.

      &quot;Shut up, Humbert Humbert. Why don&#39;t you go stare at your sleeping loli?!&quot; Seth got 
defensive. &quot;Hey! She&#39;s going to be okay in a few more months! It won&#39;t be long until she&#39;s 
sixteen and it won&#39;t be so weird!&quot;

      The two continued to argue, thus waking Abby in the process. She let her red eyes 
drift to her daughter, pleasantly asleep on top of her. Sakura was stroking her blonde hair. 
&quot;My, my. For a girl head over heels for Seth, she sure does like using me as a booby 
pillow,&quot; Abby murmured, smiling at her lover.

      Sakura&#39;s wings ruffled a bit as she thought to herself. &quot;Maybe... maybe it runs in the 
family. I like using you as a booby pillow too,&quot; the white haired woman said. Abby sat up 
and met her lips as the angel wrapped her wings around them.

      Isaka and Seth&#39;s fighting was interrupted by Tycara running out to the patio. &quot;Aw! My 
mommies are always trying to be weird when I go to sleep!&quot; Isaka and Seth peered through the 
glass to see Sakura and Abby going at it.

      The demon patted Seth on the shoulder. &quot;Isn&#39;t it nice going out with Tycara? Your in 
laws basically give you a free show every day!&quot; He rolled his eyes and looked away. &quot;Shut 
up...&quot;

      Tycara walked over to him and sat down in his lap. &quot;Seth! Seth! You know, I&#39;ve been 
growing a lot and soon, I&#39;ll be back to normal!&quot; She gave him a hug and he awkwardly hugged 
her back. It was so weird having your girlfriend in such a small body. It was like having a 
little sister.

      However, the look Isaka gave him made Seth wish he had demonic powers just so he could 
bop her on the head. 

***** 

      Tsuru had fretted about everything. Her hair, her clothes, her flipping eye. She HATED 
her eye. Why oh why did she have to get a nasty scar? Well, she knew the reason why, as well 
as who, but that was beyond the point. She settled for bandaging it, since it was less 
obtrusive than an eyepatch.

      She decided to dress kind of nice for the occasion, but left her hair up in a 
ponytail. A cute, fashionable jacket, colorful top and jeans. Great. Now all she needed was 
her cute date. Well, not really a date, but whatever. In Tsuru&#39;s world, just being with 
Krystal was fine. She checked the text on her phone, still happy over Krystal&#39;s reply. She 
was waiting by the fountain, people passing by. Some were giving her funny looks, but it 
didn&#39;t matter.

      Tsuru was on a sort of not date!

      Speaking of which... &quot;Tsuru!&quot; She turned to see Krystal walking towards her. She was 
wearing a skirt and the blue haired girl had to remind herself to admire her legs later, 
when Krystal wasn&#39;t looking. &quot;Hey,&quot; Tsuru replied with a wave. This was great. Fabulous. 
They started up small talk and went down the sidewalk.

      There were plenty of stands selling food and Tsuru immediately suggested they have 
lunch.
