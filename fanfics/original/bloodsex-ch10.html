<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        Alice and Jess left the shop together, and Hunter smiled to 
herself slightly. Her boss looked good in her formal wear, and oddly 
fitting beside the tough looking tattoo artist. She had been a bit 
surprised to see Alice with the exotic Jess, but she had gotten used to 
it.

        &quot;You two have fun now,&quot; Hunter called out with a laugh, the 
buzzcut blonde dressed to kill in her tight white T-shirt and blue 
jeans.

        &quot;Stay out of trouble,&quot; Jess called back with a grin.

        Hunter chuckled softly, not tossing a remark back by force of 
will alone. She looked around the bookstore, moving from behind the 
counter to check the magazine rack, then moved over to the erotica 
section with a smile. She straightened out the books, noting which ones 
had been paged through the most.

        &#39;Might have to try that one myself,&#39; Hunter chuckled, putting 
the re- issue of Artemis Oakgrove&#39;s &#39;Council&#39; trilogy back. She didn&#39;t 
mind a bit of the rough stuff, as long as it was coming from someone who 
actually cared.

        &quot;Hey Hunter,&quot; the little redhead beamed as she came inside, her 
breasts bouncing a bit in a little tube-top. She leaned over the counter 
Hunter had moved behind, giving her a lovely view down the front of her 
top.

        Hunter took a few moments to admire the lovely view, lingering 
until the subject of her gaze&#39;s nipples got hard. &quot;Hi Becky,&quot; she 
drawled, only then looking up to meet the blushing girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;looking 
to pick something up?&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re bad, Hunter,&quot; Becky said, her green eyes flashing. Still 
she didn&#39;t move back before adding, &quot;I think that&#39;s why I like you.&quot;

        Hunter was regretful as she reached out to stroke Becky&#39;s cheek, 
&quot;Too bad I&#39;m watching the store all alone, today, otherwise I&#39;d take you 
into the back and....&quot;

        &quot;Bad girl,&quot; Becky swatted at her arm. &quot;Do you ever get serious 
about anyone,&quot; Becky asked, suddenly grave, &quot;or do you just like taking 
us into the back?&quot;

        Hunter met her eyes questioningly, but the girl seemed to 
honestly want an answer. &quot;I try not to get serious,&quot; she said honestly.

        &quot;I thought so,&quot; Becky said. She smiled slightly, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t 
want to fall in love with you, you&#39;d break a girl&#39;s heart.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe so,&quot; Hunter nodded unashamed, &quot;but any girl I&#39;m with 
knows what she&#39;s getting into. I&#39;m always honest about that.&quot;

        Becky leaned forward, surprising Hunter as she gently kissed 
her, &quot;I know.&quot; She took a step back from the counter, &quot;Would you like to 
go out after work?&quot;

        Hunter was so distracted by the sway of Becky&#39;s hips that she 
nearly forgot to answer. &quot;Yes, please,&quot; she grinned as the redhead 
sauntered out the door.

        Hunter sat back on her seat, feeling her panties squish slightly 
as she moved. &#39;Alice would have to leave me watching the store alone,&#39; 
she thought wryly. She took a shuddering breath, &#39;Still, this is lots 
better than it was a few years ago...&#39;

        Hunter heard the movement, her body blazing with hunger as she 
fought against her chains, struggled to be free. The tall, busty blonde 
entered the room, followed by a more petite black haired girl. She 
looked up at two of them and licked her lips, her imagination running 
wild as she considered what she could do to them....

        &quot;So this is the succubus,&quot; the blonde noted regally. When she 
turned her head slightly an odd looking symbol became visible, one 
tattooed onto her cheek.

        &quot;Yes Lady Diana,&quot; the dark haired girl said in a clearly servile 
kind of way. &quot;Our occultists acquired her just a few days ago, and once 
her unique quality became apparent she was sent to us,&quot; she explained 
crisply.

        &quot;How did they discover that, Grace?&quot; Diana asked curiously.

        &quot;As succubii usually target only males, a female guard was 
assigned to watch over her,&quot; Grace shifted uncomfortably under Hunter&#39;s 
hungry gaze, &quot;the other guards found her unconscious the next morning.&quot;

        Diana smiled dangerously, &quot;Drained to death?&quot;

        &quot;Sadly no,&quot; Grace answered, &quot;just exhausted.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m hungry,&quot; Hunter rasped out, trying to get closer to the two 
women, near enough to touch, to taste the sweetness...

        &quot;And you will be fed,&quot; Diana looked down at her coldly, &quot;just at 
my convenience.&quot; She looked over at Grace thoughtfully, then turned to 
the guards, &quot;Release the shackles.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; the guard nodded.

        A remote controlled switch was hit and suddenly Hunter&#39;s wrists 
were free of their bonds. Before she could move suddenly Diana pushed 
her assistant from behind, &quot;Feed then.&quot;

        &quot;My Lady, no... &quot; Grace stumbled forward, nearly falling. She 
was stopped smoothly, surprised by the gentleness of the hands that 
caught her by the shoulders. She looked up, lost in those blue eyes even 
as she was gently held.

        Hunter leaned forward, lips softly pressing against Grace&#39;s, 
completely unaware of the Lady and the guards leaving, the door being 
locked behind them. &quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; she sighed, pulling the 
woman&#39;s suit jacket off.

        Grace&#39;s breath was raspy, her brown eyes cloudy with her intense 
desire. She began to unbutton her own blouse, shrugging the white cloth 
off to reveal the lace bra that she wore beneath it. Before she could 
move Hunter leaned forward to press those fiery lips to pale flesh, 
bringing soft cries of pleasure from Grace&#39;s lips.

        &quot;So lovely,&quot; Hunter sighed as she released the front clasp of 
the woman&#39;s bra, letting those swelling mounds fill her hands. She let 
her raspy tongue tease each nipple, biting occasionally, mixing pleasure 
and pain in her companion&#39;s mind.

        &quot;I can&#39;t stand it,&quot; Grace whimpered, throwing her head back in 
ecstasy.

        Hunter abandoned the breasts a moment, bringing her lips to the 
woman&#39;s ear. &quot;I&#39;ve barely begun,&quot; she murmured as she undid the severe 
skirt Grace wore.

        Grace lifted her hips willingly, helping Hunter remove the 
skirt, shuddering as the chill air caressed her soaked panties. Hunter&#39;s 
lips found hers as she drew the black lace down, revealing the cleanly 
shaved flesh below it.

        &quot;So beautiful,&quot; Hunter crouched like a hunting cat between 
Grace&#39;s legs, hesitating a moment to look up into Grace&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;Please,&quot; Grace spread her legs, breasts rising and falling 
rapidly as she reached down, using her fingers to split those lovely 
pink lips. &quot;Please....&quot;

        Hunter leaned forward slowly, pressing her lips to silken 
wetness and let her tongue flick out. Grace squealed as she lapped up 
the cream, working the outside first, enjoying the squirming of those 
long gorgeous legs.

        &quot;You&#39;re driving me crazy,&quot; Grace yelped, pulling and pinching at 
her distended nipples.

        &quot;That&#39;s the idea,&quot; Hunter sighed happily. Taking pity on her 
lovely partner Hunter zeroed in on the clitoris and proceeded to blow 
her mind....

        The morning sun rose, and Hunter was barely aware of the return 
of Lady Diana, only protesting sleepily when the unconscious Grace was 
pulled out of her arms. &quot;Check her over,&quot; Diana ordered, &quot;I want to know 
if there are an ill effects.&quot;

        Hunter turned on to her back, her slim body slick with sweat and 
the remnants of sexual heat. Even with her hunger so fully sated she 
smiled up at Diana seductively, taking in the pleasant fact that the 
Lady did not wear panties....

        &quot;If Grace recovers,&quot; Diana looked down at her with an obviously 
calculating expression, &quot;I know a certain brothel that would welcome you 
with open arms.&quot; A cold little smile, &quot;You&#39;re going to make me a great 
deal of money.&quot;

        &#39;I was in that brothel for months, a slave to my hungers,&#39; she 
thought, stretching out. Hunter smiled wryly, smelling her musk hanging 
in the air, &#39;If Jess hadn&#39;t gotten me out, I&#39;d probably still be in 
there servicing the richest pussy in the city.&#39;

        Hunter looked up at the clock, feeling a bit of relief at how 
close it was to closing time. The bell by the door rang, and Becky 
walked in with a smile. &quot;When do you get off again?&quot; she asked.

        Hunter met her eyes, sensing the girl&#39;s own sexual hunger, 
feeling her own rising to meet it. &quot;I don&#39;t think Alice would mind if I 
closed up a bit early,&quot; she purred.

        &quot;Oh good,&quot; Becky leaned forward to kiss her gently.</pre>
