<h1>All Girls School (part 54 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch53.html">Back to Part 53</a><pre>&quot;If you need me, I&#39;ll be reading. Don&#39;t stay up too late; you&#39;ve both 
got a busy day tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Kay&#39;. Bye, mom.&quot; Janet Keys smiled, closed the door to her room, and 
left the two girls to their privacy for the remainder of the evening. 
Jocelyn perched herself on the couch and patted the seat next to her, 
inviting Erica to join her. Feeling slightly bloated from dinner, Erica 
sat and nervously wrung her hands. Her eyes wandered to Jocelyn and to 
the floor, but she was otherwise unoccupied and ill-prepared for the 
promised talk. Jocelyn edged a little closer.

&quot;To tell you the truth,&quot; she said, laughing very weakly, &quot;I&#39;m really 
grateful you&#39;re here. You&#39;re not... always here, but you&#39;re here when it 
matters, and... that&#39;s good. I like that. I like having you around.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Good.&quot; Fox mentally winced. Oh, good? What kind of a response was 
that? Jocelyn smiled, sensing her friend&#39;s anxiety. She nudged a little 
closer and took Erica&#39;s hand.

&quot;You&#39;re a godsend, you know. I, uh... I really couldn&#39;t have gone very 
far without ya. Sounds stupid, I know, but it&#39;s the way I feel.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not stupid, but... I kinda feel left behind. Like you&#39;re getting 
all the... action.&quot;

&quot;Well what do you want?&quot; Erica looked away. Uh-oh. This was the question 
she had such a hard time answering. What did she want: peace on Earth, 
or peace in their homes? To find love, or for Jocelyn to find peace? To 
have Alisha shut up, or to have her be a real sister and be kind to her? 
A million dollars, or other riches? What, what?

&quot;What do you think about... what I told you?&quot; she squeaked. Oh, so was 
that what she wanted? She wanted Jocelyn to answer in a way that made 
her happy, right? But wasn&#39;t that selfish&#151;or did Erica Fox finally 
deserve to think about herself, after bearing her friend on her shoulder 
all that time? In any case, it took McKeough some time to answer.

&quot;You&#39;re really in love with me? I mean, honestly? And by that you 
mean... like romantic love? Because... I love you as a sister, of 
course.&quot;

&quot;Oh, if that&#39;s the way you want to interpret it, then I&#39;m okay.&quot;

&quot;But what did you mean?&quot; Erica looked away bashfully, rubbing her arms 
as if she were cold.

&quot;Um... I guess you could say I... kinda got attracted to you in an 
unusual way, kinda after the, uh... the funeral and all. I mean, I don&#39;t 
mean it like I was stalking you and waiting for your boyfriend to die or 
anything, I just...&quot;

She had Jocelyn&#39;s attention. Here was a girl she could be honest with, 
and not expect angry repercussion. So she relented and released her 
thoughts.

&quot;I was just there for you,&quot; she murmured, &quot;and you needed my help, and I 
stepped up and helped you. And since then... yes, I can say that I fell 
in love with you. But you&#39;re my best friend, and I&#39;m... well, you know, 
gay, so maybe it was expected. I mean, I&#39;ve never thought of you that 
way before, and I don&#39;t know why I do now, it&#39;s just...&quot; And here her 
voice lowered to a whisper, and she blushed and smiled. &quot;I needed 
someone, and you were there for me; then you needed someone, and I was 
there for you. It... sounds kinda silly now.&quot; She laughed softly and 
rubbed her cheek, not knowing what to make of the developments.

Jocelyn put her best foot forward and kissed Erica on her lips.

And held it.

&quot;You&#39;re my guardian angel,&quot; she whispered, taking Erica&#39;s semi-long soft 
curly copper hair in her fingers. She looped the twists and waves around 
her fingers until they were securely coiled, and kissed Erica again. 
&quot;It&#39;s weird in a way, me doing this with you so soon after his death,&quot; 
she whispered. &quot;But I think Andrew would want me to find somebody who 
would take care of me and the baby, somebody I knew we could all trust. 
Who better to fit that description than you?&quot;

&quot;But... I don&#39;t want to replace him, and that&#39;s part of the problem.&quot; 
Both girls blushed a little as Jocelyn put her forehead against her 
friend&#39;s, pressing their noses together and letting their eyes meet.

&quot;I know. Nobody can. But you&#39;re pretty irreplaceable yourself, Ricky&#151;and 
I do love you, honestly I do. I think I&#39;ve known ever since the day 
after the funeral, when I wept over little more than delicious waffles. 
Remember?&quot; Erica grinned and nodded, though she was crying. Joss had 
been a mess back then, but time and love had healed that wound, and here 
she was now, about ready to lead people in a protest!

&quot;So, do you...?&quot; It was almost too much to hope for...

&quot;Yes, I do.&quot; But on very, very rare occasions, hope can come through and 
give people an extra reason to believe in it. Erica couldn&#39;t help but 
beam with joy when she heard the news. Nor could Jocelyn, as she was 
thanked and embraced. Together, they lost count of how many times they 
kissed and held and whispered that night, until bed and the pressing 
issues of the world called them for rest.

And in this fashion, the week began.
The Protest

&quot;Part Five: Negotiations&quot;

Alisha keenly watched Vai Knox from afar, keeping herself warm in the 
cold morning. She was feeling awfully serene that day, neither in a mood 
to pester her sister nor one to scout for a date, nor even one for great 
excitement. She was at peace with herself, probably because she had been 
told the truth just recently. So, Erica was finally ready to admit it. 
Well, she looked happier for it, and supposedly that was all that 
mattered. Even Jocelyn looked more peaceful, more passionate than 
before, and spoke with a new voice, although everyone felt like the 
climax of the protest was over, and now it was only a matter of time 
before results came in.

Only a matter of time before people lost their spirit...

It was obvious not everyone thought as Usha or Jocelyn did. The war was 
far away, irrelevant in their own homes, something in the back of their 
minds: to complain or lampoon, to comment or criticize, to hail or to 
scorn&#151;but not to care about, not for long. Usha was just burning herself 
out, poor thing, and it looked as if Jocelyn had found a new source of 
peace, one that quelled her hatred and anger and turned it into a new 
form of generosity and kindness&#151;similar to its elder incarnation, but 
different, maybe better.

Alisha still didn&#39;t have a girlfriend. Bummer. She didn&#39;t know Vai well 
enough to know whether she was interested in girls or not&#151;heck, during 
the play, the two of them had a faux romantic scene and were supposed to 
embrace, but Vai always did it uncomfortably. It was like hugging a 
steel beam. She had excellent ideas and quietly took Miss Post aside to 
share them, but otherwise didn&#39;t interact at all. Well, maybe she was 
just shy, and shy girls were certainly okay in Fox&#39;s book. She shivered 
and approached Vai, who was off by herself, not a friend to talk to.

So she was lonely. Also a plus.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Vai nodded. &quot;Cold out here, huh?&quot;

&quot;I hate small talk,&quot; she grunted bluntly. Alisha frowned.

&quot;Yeah, me too. It&#39;s such a load of bullshit. So, uh, whaddya make of the 
play?&quot;

&quot;I think I might quit it,&quot; said Knox, emitting a ghost as she sighed. 
&quot;I&#39;m no good on the stage. I mean, I&#39;ve dreamt of going on there, it&#39;s 
just... I&#39;m inexperienced. My parents say I&#39;d do good, but what do they 
know? They&#39;re slowly fazing themselves out of my life. Come my 
twenty-first birthday, they won&#39;t know me from a stranger.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that sucks.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Plus, I have no idea where I&#39;m going for college, and I haven&#39;t 
found a good job yet since my temporary one ended a month ago.&quot;

&quot;Oh, where did you work?&quot;

&quot;Some dorm on campus. I was cleaning rooms and stuff. Worst job I ever 
had.&quot;

&quot;Oh, crap.&quot; Alisha made a face and grunted. &quot;Man, that does sound like 
shit. The worst job I ever had was working for UPS. Guess how long that 
lasted.&quot;

&quot;A month?&quot; Alisha touched her nose&#151;bingo.

&quot;Yeah, about thirty days too many. I&#39;m still living off that money, 
believe it or not. Say, you doing anything tonight?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t consider a whole lot of nothing much of an activity, so no.&quot; 
Alisha crossed her arms. Now here was a girl with a snake&#39;s bite, a chip 
on her shoulder the size of a tree, and obvious pain from several bad 
circumstances. Perhaps if a different person had experienced her 
troubles, they would&#39;ve killed themselves or gone mad, or else turned to 
crime or drugs or some other self-destruction (Fox noticed a few 
self-inflicted wounds on Vai&#39;s arm and cringed). Vai, though beautiful, 
looked haggard and beaten, like an old ship that had gone through a 
storm only to find a hostile port. She was a strong, beautiful, 
frightening woman, maybe too much for Alisha.

Then again, she was pretty damned horny.

&quot;Would you like to go out somewhere, do something?&quot; Vai frowned.

&quot;Only if you&#39;re serious.&quot;

&quot;I am.&quot;

&quot;Are you? Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes, yes.&quot; Why was she asking, anyway? Of course Alisha was serious. 
What, had some guy approached her, offered to be her boyfriend, and 
ignored her the next day? (Ah, indeed, the levels of pain a human can 
bear rival the very circles of Hell)

&quot;...I&#39;d love to,&quot; she answered. Alisha grinned.

&quot;Great, it&#39;s a date.&quot;

&quot;Oh, wait&#151;I&#39;m not so sure if I want to date a girl.&quot;

What are you saying, Vai? Go for it! This may be your only chance!

&quot;If we&#39;re going as friends, sure, no problem. I&#39;m just... I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;m interested in girls.&quot;

Vai, honey, you masturbate thinking about girls. You nearly took your 
own virginity thinking about Dawn, that stupid fairy-girl you created 
for your story! Go for it!

&quot;If you were a guy, it&#39;d be a different story, of course.&quot;

Come on, give it a chance! Don&#39;t pass up another opportunity. Remember 
the seventh grade?

&quot;Um... that&#39;s fine,&quot; said Alisha; &quot;I&#39;m willing to compromise. Just as 
friends, then, wherever you want.&quot;

Yup, you blew it. And she&#39;s probably your type!

You blew it, Fox. A nice angsty girl like that and you blew it. She&#39;s 
probably your type, too!

&quot;All right. Um... I&#39;ve got a car, let&#39;s just meet at that deli place 
down the street. Uh... Slot&#39;s-something; I can&#39;t pronounce the name.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me neither. Cool.&quot; Alisha hung back, and little by little, she 
distanced herself from Vai, and became lost in the group of girls and 
women. Vai sighed, tapping the back of her head against the brick wall 
as she berated herself.

You are so going to regret this.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; she whispered to herself; &quot;I know what I&#39;m doing.&quot;

.......

In spite of how she had previously felt about Usha, Kula couldn&#39;t help 
but pity the woman for what she was doing to herself. She was obviously 
weak from so many days of speaking out, protesting, and generally making 
a prudish firebrand of herself. How had Marbel done it, all those years 
ago? Usha looked ready to faint at any given moment, and her health was 
probably deteriorating due to being outside so much. Then again, Jocelyn 
looked healthier than ever, and she had gone through similar ordeals. 
Perhaps this business sucked away one&#39;s life: by slipping into it 
momentarily, one did not feel its affects, but if one had a prolonged 
stay...

Usha quietly and suddenly excused herself, feeling exhausted. Mira 
guided her down and held her, warming her slowly with her body heat. 
Blake was unfortunately home sick, and could barely make it past her 
bedroom door, let alone her house, so it was up to Krishnan&#39;s rival, 
partner, and girlfriend to support her. She was still capable of 
speaking and listening, so the two exchanged words. It was agreed that 
Usha would say no more, simply because she had said everything possible.

As newcomer Yuki Kogure had said, &quot;It&#39;s now in the hands of other 
people.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do?&quot; wondered Alexis Walker to herself. &quot;Wait? Just wait 
for news, for reactions? Maybe all this has been in vain after all. Who 
cares?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; said Kathlyn, who was next to her. &quot;A lot of people 
put some real effort into this, and you gotta admit, this whole week of 
marching around the school has made a believer in a lotta people.&quot;

&quot;A believer in what?&quot;

&quot;In whatever they like to believe in. For some, it&#39;s an end to the war, 
or the abolition of the draft; for others, it&#39;s just belief, or hope, or 
vague things like that.&quot;

&quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;Me? Oh, I&#39;ve already got my thing. I&#39;m just here out of curiosity, and 
besides, the nice crisp air makes me feel a little better.&quot; Walker 
smirked and grunted before sneezing.

&quot;Damn, this morning air is some chilly shit. If they&#39;re gonna do 
something, they better do it fast.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. It is pretty cold.&quot; Kathlyn grinned, but excused herself a moment 
later. Alexis watched her leave and enter into the embrace of Leena, 
where she stayed for the duration of the morning vigil. Walker raised a 
curious eyebrow: the actions of her ex-girlfriend were now of sudden 
interest to her.

&quot;They can&#39;t be,&quot; she mused to herself. &quot;...Can they?&quot;

Mira was keeping Usha warm. Jocelyn and Erica were holding hands. Ayanna 
and Hero were talking. Marbel was nowhere to be found. The group started 
to disperse. And then, the bell rang. The protest was over for another 
day, and school was about ready to begin. The crowd thinned and 
vanished, leaving none behind. Usha gave Mira a sad look.

&quot;Was it all for nothing? Has nothing been accomplished?&quot;

&quot;Hush, silly,&quot; hissed van Dijk gently. &quot;You&#39;re too impatient. Just wait. 
We&#39;ll learn something later. Come, you are like a kid waiting for 
Sinterklaas to arrive.&quot; Mira guided Usha inside, and promised to meet 
her again as many times as possible&#151;maybe sneak off together and make 
out in secret. As weary and disappointed as she was, Usha could not 
refuse that offer.

Andeira Torvald was just getting into her Spanish lessons when the PA 
came on. Headmistress Marbel sounded happier than usual, if the stern 
woman was even capable of unusual happiness. Naturally, when she spoke, 
everyone listened, which was just the affect she had wanted.

&quot;Attention, students and faculty of Stanton. For the past week, many of 
you have participated in the protest that has attracted people from all 
over the area, even some from other states. We&#39;ve been on the news and 
the newspapers, and people have talked about us, how we operate and what 
we believe in. Students and faculty, I have just been informed that the 
President of the United States, after&#151;and I quote&#151;serious deliberation 
and regards to the public opinion&#151;here&#39;s where I&#39;d like to wedge in our 
own little contribution&#151;after all that thinking, he has rescinded his 
earlier proposal in regards to the draft. It will not&#151;I repeat, the 
draft will not be in affect for his upcoming election year! Thank you, 
that is all.&quot;

A few of the older women remembered times when they had cheered to the 
sounds of good news, and now was no different. Few classrooms did not 
have some girl hissing in excitement. One or two had people shouting, 
standing on desks, whistling, hugging, even kissing. Andeira Torvald 
breathed a sigh of relief and smiled as her class celebrated in their 
own way. Usha received her fair share of pats on the back, and even got 
one from Kula.

&quot;Well done, old bird,&quot; she said, faking an English accent. &quot;I guess 
being a selfish asshole does pay off once in awhile, eh?&quot;

&quot;Uh, thanks,&quot; she managed. Kula laughed and slapped hands with her 
classmates; Torvald calmed her students a few minutes later, 
congratulated all of them, and resumed, with all the other members of 
Stanton&#39;s faculty, business as usual.

............

Janet had heard the news and was glad, and congratulated her foster 
daughter over dinner. She did not yet know the full extent of her 
relationship with Erica, but even as a substitute parent, Keys could 
figure a few things out and add things up. She would learn eventually, 
but for the moment, being in the dark wasn&#39;t so bad. She had not seen 
Jocelyn so happy since she moved in, nor Erica so open and loving. The 
girls were skittish and a little bubbly, but considering what had 
happened (both on and off campus), it was expected. Janet figured the 
young ones would want privacy again for the evening, so she retired to 
her room and caught up on a few movies.

As soon as they were alone, Erica leaped into her best friend&#39;s arms 
like a tigress and kissed her deeply, furiously, using an intensity that 
was alien to her. Jocelyn squealed and giggled, fitting her arms around 
her best friend and locking them together, until their bodies pressed 
against each other&#39;s. Their gasps surged in between kisses; their eyes, 
both like seas during a bleak storm, relished in the visual art before 
them and met, storm clashing against storm, lips brushing as hands 
clasped and bodies twisted. Erica cupped her dearest friend&#39;s jaw in her 
hand, and smothered her mouth with a desperate kiss.

She put her tongue forth boldly, first pressing up against the barrier 
that was Jocelyn&#39;s mouth, then finding tentative access as she submitted 
to the carnal urges of her meek friend. Erica was sacrificing reason for 
instinct&#151;no matter that this was her best friend, or a girl who had been 
straight a month ago, or that she was pregnant with her boyfriend&#39;s 
child&#151;no matter, Erica was parched for the other woman, and as Jocelyn&#39;s 
tongue wrapped itself around her own, the thirst became even more 
desperate.

Erica gasped and dug deep for more. She licked the insides of her 
beloved&#39;s mouth, painting the fleshy walls with her tongue, nearly 
choking as Jocelyn slathered her with saliva and kisses. She took her 
beloved&#39;s tongue deep in her mouth, sucking on it softly, gently, 
running her lips over it like it was a Popsicle. Jocelyn shuddered and 
grabbed her friend&#39;s hands, entwining fingers together in an erotic 
touch, electrifying the sensitive nerves in the fingers and palm as skin 
met with skin. Pregnant or no, she leaned forward heavily, pressing her 
weight into her friend, until they fell gracefully into the lap of the 
couch, desperate and irrational.

Jocelyn dislodged herself from Erica after awhile to breathe, and pulled 
her friend up so they could at least kiss. She smiled as she caressed 
those curly locks, colored like shining pennies from heaven, yet richer 
in scent and value. She gasped as she saw levels of Erica&#39;s beauty that 
had never been discovered before: a weight revealed, tiny secrets kept 
during lonely days, nightly dreams and prayers, little hopes and 
irritations during the days that seemed most lonely, most depressing and 
sacred. She kissed her friend in every place she needed, and whispered 
her name, saying how much she was in love.

That was it, then. Jocelyn McKeough was in love with her own best 
friend.

Not a lesbian, she said playfully, not even bisexual&#151;just in love.

There was a difference. Erica laughed.

She placed her lips on her friend&#39;s neck and explored it thoroughly, 
leaving tiny little trails of moisture and very, very faint impressions. 
It was like making a path through a forest, and here were markers to 
show her where she had been&#151;familiar territory, or unexplored areas? 
Jocelyn hissed and tilted her head far back, totally exposing her neck; 
Erica licked her friend&#39;s throat from top to bottom, and nibbled at the 
sides, wedging her teeth into the skin just enough to give her friend a 
little jolt. Jocelyn cooed and found herself lost&#151;but ah, there were 
plenty of markers to show her the way back, if she desired it.

Erica kissed Jocelyn&#39;s ear and whispered for her to raise her arms. She 
did so, slowly and willingly. Her long-sleeved blue lacetop came off, 
masking her face briefly before finding itself neatly placed on the 
couch, and she became a little more naked for her friend. Jocelyn 
blushed as Erica gazed at her skin, imperfect and blemished faintly 
around the shoulders. Erica squeezed her beloved&#39;s shoulders and nuzzled 
her neck, loving her deeper. Boom-boom-boom went her pulse; closing her 
eyes accentuated the pleasure.

Erica stared hard at Jocelyn as she unbuttoned her blouse. She looked so 
serious, so wanting, that Jocelyn felt it a crime not to help. They 
giggled as their fingers stumbled and fumbled, sometimes &quot;accidentally&quot; 
brushing up against the chest, and kissed just to feel each other again. 
The blouse came off without flair and joined the shirt; two girls in 
girlish brassieres held each other and felt new waves of wonder as bare 
skin met bare skin: arms entwined, chests discovered friction, lips and 
tongues went everywhere, &quot;I love you so much.&quot;

Together the girls raced inside Jocelyn&#39;s room, carrying their discarded 
shirts with them. Together they stood and melded, meshing lips and 
tongues together as their arms explored each other&#39;s bodies, rubbing and 
touching shoulders, the back, the arms, and the bottom. Erica gave a 
cute yelp as Jocelyn squeezed her rear, and shuddered with a great moan 
as her friend got down on her knees, kissed her little belly button, and 
took off her jeans. Undressed, Erica took her beloved&#39;s hands and pinned 
her to the floor, towering over her slightly until she pressed the 
weight of her body upon her. Her hands worked to take off Jocelyn&#39;s 
black baggy pants, struggling with the belt until all was gone. She took 
her friend&#39;s hand, climbed into the bed, and held tight as they 
exchanged anxious glances.

&quot;This is getting intense,&quot; whispered Fox, touching her beloved&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she croaked. She tried breaking the ice by kissing Erica&#39;s nose, 
and whispered, &quot;I like it.&quot;

&quot;Should we really... do this? Joss, if this makes you uncomfortable...&quot;

&quot;Do you really think it does?&quot; Erica giggled.

&quot;No. All that moaning certainly didn&#39;t help.&quot; They laughed softly 
together, kissed again, and drew their bodies together for deep 
intimacy. Their legs locked together as the only barriers between them 
merged; Jocelyn looked up at her dearest friend and smiled, knowing what 
she wanted to do&#151;what she meant to do. She put her hands on her back and 
struggled for a few seconds to release the undergarment, and Erica&#39;s 
breasts were free to the world. Jocelyn grinned and took one in her 
hand.

&quot;They&#39;re so... cute!&quot;

&quot;Heehee, thanks. Now let&#39;s see yours.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she sang, feeling lightheaded. Since she was lying down, Erica 
atop her, she sat up briefly just so she could twist her bra around and 
unhook it easier. This way, Erica saw a premature version of her 
friend&#39;s naked chest, and tried not to blush too hard as she helped get 
it off. She giggled and smiled, kissing Jocelyn&#39;s lips once as she 
caressed one of the ovular mounds in her palm.

&quot;They&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she said.

&quot;Thanks. So are you.&quot;

&quot;Heehee, so corny.&quot;

&quot;Aw, you love it!&quot; Their moaning became louder as they hugged, each 
breast finding a mate to bury itself into. They hissed and gasped as 
their naked chests swept sideways and up and down, feeling each other&#39;s 
sensitivity through their own. Jocelyn must&#39;ve blacked out a little once 
as Erica released herself and kissed her nipple; she moaned desperately 
as the girl&#39;s tongue circled around. She panted as her hands ran over 
the other one, tickling and feeling and allowing the erotic sense of 
touch take over. Gasp, moan, hiss, pleasures anew, and greater because 
of their source.

Erica put her lips on the chest bone that covered her friend&#39;s heart, 
and laid them there until she could feel its pulse in her mouth. She 
smiled up at Jocelyn, eyes misty, and kissed lower: down to her rising 
and falling tummy, onto her belly button&#151;her tongue dipped in a few 
times&#151;further down to her hips.

&quot;Lips and hips,&quot; she mused, tracing her finger along the hem of her 
friend&#39;s underwear. She giggled as she saw them close up: &quot;Heehee, 
chocobo underwear? You really are obsessed, Joss.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I... found them on E-bay for fifteen bucks, I couldn&#39;t resist!&quot; 
Fox laughed and tickled her through her underwear, making Joss miserable 
with new pleasures and feelings. She gasped, and kept gasping, as Erica 
slipped her hand beneath them, and wiggled them off with a bit of 
effort. She threw them on the ground, smiling maliciously. The look on 
her face was neither meek nor gentle, but foxy, seductive, and sexual. 
Erica had an animal in her after all, and that animal had urges that 
Jocelyn found, quite frankly, exciting.

&quot;Hey, come on,&quot; she managed as Erica tickled her pubic hair. &quot;You gotta 
get naked for me too.&quot;

&quot;Mm, say please.&quot;

&quot;Please, Erica, please... let me undress you.&quot; Fox laughed seductively, 
driving her best friend wild.

&quot;Oh, you&#39;re sexy when you beg. Well, here they are.&quot; Erica turned around 
completely, aiming her rear straight at Jocelyn&#39;s face. McKeough 
grimaced and gave the girl&#39;s hindquarters a firm slap.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t stick that thing in my face!&quot; She laughed and yanked down 
Erica&#39;s uninspiring white panties, and pulled them off as her friend 
stretched her legs out. She slapped her behind once more for good 
measure, and since they were in that position anyway...

&quot;Hey Jocelyn, what number am I thinking of?&quot; It was an obvious answer.

&quot;Sixty-nine, dudes!&quot;

......

Weary and yet oddly horny at the same time, Jocelyn twisted herself and 
her lover around until she was on top, looking down upon her guardian 
angel with ferocious love and sexual instinct. It was now her turn to 
take Erica&#39;s breasts in her mouth, to lick her chest greedily, to stuff 
her face in the girl&#39;s armpits and neck and tickle her. It was her turn 
to please her friend; she raised herself slightly and touched her 
friend&#39;s pubic hair, very nearly reaching her vagina. Erica was seeing 
stars and hearing fireworks.

&quot;Jocelyn,&quot; she whispered. Her friend and lover smiled at her.

&quot;Yeah?&quot; What Erica said next was too beautiful, too honest to describe.

&quot;I want to give you my virginity.&quot;

&quot;...Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m positive. Please.&quot; There was no way now that Joss could 
refuse.

&quot;When I gave Andrew my virginity,&quot; she mused, digging two fingers inside 
her lover at long last, &quot;it felt masochistic, good and bad at the same 
time. I gotta be honest with you, Ricky: the stuff hurts like hell, even 
if the person doing it is someone you know and trust. And yeah, it does 
feel kinda good, but kind of in a sick way.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; she begged, whispering gently, &quot;do it.&quot; Jocelyn smiled and 
used her free hand to grab Erica&#39;s floundering hand.

&quot;With pleasure.&quot; She found Erica&#39;s hymen after some effort&#151;she had once 
accidentally touched her own during masturbation, and had stopped right 
then out of fright&#151;and pierced it as gently and lovingly as she could. 
Erica gagged herself on a pillow to stop screaming.

&quot;Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... fuck! ...Damn, that hurt!&quot; she spat. Her 
face turned cherry red as she caught her breath. &quot;Oh, uh, sorry.&quot; 
Jocelyn merely giggled.

&quot;Heehee, it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m sorry too.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; gasped Fox, &quot;don&#39;t be sorry at all. I... wanted you to do that, 
remember?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Sheesh, what a mess. Be right back.&quot; Jocelyn wandered away, snuck 
into the bathroom, and came out a few seconds later with a wet, warm 
rag. Erica winced as her friend matted up the blood, and just to be 
safe, she kissed it better. Fox giggled and moaned a little at the same 
time.

&quot;Hurt?&quot;

&quot;Mm, kiss it again.&quot; Jocelyn laughed and happily obeyed&#151;several times. 
She finally snuggled back into Erica&#39;s arms, staring down at the woman 
she loved, the woman she was now connected to for all of time. She 
rested her palm on the girl&#39;s face and sighed, kissing her deeply before 
speaking.

&quot;This was... indescribable. I can&#39;t believe I made love to my own best 
friend. Mmm, but it kinda makes sense in a way. I believe you can&#39;t 
really be in love with anyone unless they&#39;re your best friend.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Erica grinned, content to feel her friend&#39;s naked skin touch 
hers so closely, and cuddled closer still. She touched one of her 
breasts delicately and kept her hand there. &quot;Joss?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;I think... after today... I might be a little more than a godmother to 
that baby of yours.&quot; Jocelyn smiled and laughed, and for good measure, 
they made love to each other one last time before falling asleep.

And in this fashion, the week ended.

The End of &quot;The Protest&quot;

Stay tuned for the next &quot;All Girls School&quot; mini-series, &quot;Opening Night&quot;.
