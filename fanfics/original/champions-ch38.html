&quot;Where&#39;s Sally Redinger?&quot;

When one sees a petite young girl storm inside with rage in her eyes, 
one does not question her; they merely stand and answer. Sally had been 
in the midst of a conversation when the girl ran in, but her appearance 
silenced everyone. The blue-skinned girl stood, not knowing what 
business this young one had with her.

&quot;I&#39;m her. What can I do for you?&quot; The girl screamed and hurled herself 
against the older woman, striking her as hard as she could. Of course 
her blows were soft and unfocused; Sally grabbed hold of the girl&#39;s 
wrists and tried to calm her. &quot;Stop it! What&#39;s wrong with you? Why are 
you attacking me?&quot;

&quot;You killed him!&quot; she screamed. &quot;You killed my brother! You killed 
Akio!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me! I hate you! I hate you! You killed him, you killed 
him!&quot;

&quot;Whoa, there!&quot; Merry scooped the kid up and held her in the air; she 
hardly weighed anything, though she squirmed like a rabbit. &quot;Now what 
seems to be the proble&#151;OW! Don&#39;t hit me! Calm down and I&#151;stop it!&quot; The 
girl was fighting hard, even while captured, and so far had struck 
Rancor twice in the face. She screamed violently, mostly at Sally, who 
still had no idea why she was so hated.

&quot;Put me down! She killed my brother!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a lie! Sally wouldn&#39;t kill anyone.&quot;

&quot;She killed him!&quot;

&quot;Hold on!&quot; shouted Stevenson, running up to take control of the 
situation. He took the girl&#39;s face in his hand and stared hard, trying 
to calm her down. &quot;Ease up here, miss. This is a very serious 
accusation. What proof do you have?&quot;

&quot;The woman in the other room told me,&quot; she answered. &quot;The one with black 
hair, the one dressed like a scientist.&quot;

&quot;Yohko,&quot; sighed he, knowing who the girl meant. He looked at Sally, 
worrisome already, but she shook her head in confusion. Back to the 
girl: &quot;What was your brother&#39;s name?&quot;

&quot;Akio. Akio Valmont Neuss.&quot;

&quot;Valmont?!&quot; Sally gasped in shock, suddenly feeling low and dirty again. 
Then that boy she had killed the other day... &quot;Oh my god, I had no 
idea... Oh, what have I done...&quot;

&quot;So you did kill him!&quot; spat the girl. She wriggled again; &quot;Let me go! 
Let me go!!&quot; But Merry held fast. The commotion had called most 
everybody into the room, each gathering to watch the spectacle. They 
were filled in with the details; some even intervened and vouched for 
their friend.

&quot;Look, kid&#151;&quot;

&quot;Sarah!&quot; she screamed. &quot;Sarah Neuss!&quot;

&quot;Right, sorry. Listen, Sarah, I don&#39;t know what your brother was telling 
you, but he was running around with this real dangerous crowd calling 
themselves the Dead Zodiac. He and these other two guys came here with 
this great big army, and they were going to kill us!&quot;

&quot;You lie!&quot; she roared. &quot;My brother would never do something like that! 
He was a good guy!&quot;

&quot;It may be a different boy,&quot; noted Stevenson. &quot;Did this Akio have 
control over animals and insects?&quot;

&quot;Yes, he did, and I share his power. If you don&#39;t let me go I&#39;ll prove 
it!&quot;

&quot;Take it easy,&quot; he said, trying to pacify her. He looked at Sally 
grimly. Were it not for her blue skin, she would&#39;ve looked really sick. 
That she had killed somebody, especially one so young, was bad enough, 
but now she had a sibling to contend with!

&quot;I hate you,&quot; Sarah growled, glaring right at Miss Redinger. A chilling 
sensation suddenly came over her, like there were a thousand things 
crawling all over her body. Merry suddenly dropped Sarah on the ground 
and screamed, swatting her body everywhere as a swarm of ants covered 
her. Sally screamed in horror, but her voice was drowned out as 
cockroaches and termites crawled over her skin, suffocating and nibbling 
and festering. Locusts burst through the windows, buzzing and devouring 
everything; mosquitoes and flies darted everywhere, stinging and 
spraying their disease. Everybody was black with bugs, except for Sarah, 
who stood there glaring.

&quot;STOP IT!!&quot; She turned around and noticed a girl her age, standing 
amidst the ocean of insects. Suddenly a frightening feeling overwhelmed 
Sarah and she fell to the floor, screaming in terror. The other girl was 
overwhelmed by grasshoppers&#151;it was a stalemate. Before everything could 
fall into ruin, Julie shook the bugs off her, pounced on Sarah, and 
lightly scratched her neck with the tip of her claw, injecting venom 
into her bloodstream. The girl wobbled, fell faint, and blacked out 
quickly, and without her guiding them, the army of tiny warriors soon 
fled the scene, not a one remaining.

......

When she came to, Sarah&#39;s head was still swimming and she felt a little 
bit nauseous, but aside from fatigue, she was fine. She was lying in a 
bed next to a window yawning wide open, and a middle-aged bald man, one 
she had not seen before, was watching over her. He smiled and put his 
hand on her forehead, feeling for her temperature.

&quot;Where am I?&quot; she whispered. &quot;How did I get here? Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Slowly, now,&quot; said the man, his voice kind and rich. &quot;You&#39;ve been 
asleep for awhile. It seems your mischief has set us back a few hours, 
miss Neuss&#151;but under the conditions, it can be forgiven.&quot; He laughed 
gently and patted her arm. &quot;From the look of your face, I can see that 
you want me to get to the point! Very well, then: my name is Father 
Jacob Pochanski, a sort of leader amongst a few of the girls here, and 
friend to several others. I volunteered to take care of you while you 
were out.&quot;

&quot;Was I attacked?&quot;

&quot;You were put out of commission for awhile,&quot; he answered. &quot;You must 
understand, miss Neuss, we cannot have such violence in this building, 
even if your reasons are justified. Yes, I was told the entire story.&quot;

&quot;Then...you know.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; he answered. &quot;But if I may have your permission, I&#39;d like to 
tell you the truth about things. First, what you heard about your 
brother: I and several others were eyewitnesses when he came, with those 
others, and attacked us needlessly. Don&#39;t strain yourself,&quot; he advised, 
seeing her rise up and wince. &quot;I am a man of God, my child, and I do not 
lie unless I need to. Here I speak the truth. Unless your brother was 
not called Valmont the Summoner and could not command the beasts and 
insects of the field, I am sad to say that he is dead, and Miss Redinger 
was responsible.

&quot;However,&quot; he noted, &quot;the only crime was his own violence towards us. 
Sally did no wrong by stopping him; he surely would have caused great 
harm to others, and might have even killed someone. Tell me, would you 
rather have Akio dead, or the death of others on his shoulder?&quot;

&quot;But...he wouldn&#39;t do that!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Akio...my brother would not 
do that!&quot;

&quot;I do not know what words the Dead Zodiac used to sway him to their 
side,&quot; he said, &quot;but regardless, he was in their ranks, and certainly 
doing nothing to oppose them. I do not condone murder myself&#151;I wish 
there might have been another way, but in war, it is very difficult to 
keep one&#39;s enemies alive while also managing the well-being of one&#39;s 
friends. What is done is done,&quot; he concluded. &quot;I know it is hard to 
forgive us...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t forgive her!&quot; she insisted. &quot;I&#39;m going to make her pay for what 
she did!&quot;

&quot;Careful of what you think!&quot; he warned her. &quot;Revenge is uglier than you 
could imagine! There is no point in killing Sally; we do not live in 
such a world. Death can no longer be repaid by death, least not 
according to the Lord&#39;s laws! To kill her would bring you no 
satisfaction anyway!&quot;

&quot;But...I have to do something!&quot; she cried. &quot;I can&#39;t go on like this! Mom 
and dad are gone, I have no home, no friends, no money, and now no 
brother! There&#39;s nothing left for me to do! This might be the only way I 
could...&quot;

&quot;Child,&quot; he said sternly, &quot;I have learned one important thing in life: 
there will always be more than one path. I understand your pain, and 
even though she fought to protect others, perhaps making Sally pay for 
your brother&#39;s death would be proper. But not with her life!&quot;

&quot;How then?&quot;

&quot;Force her to serve you until the debt is paid,&quot; he stated. &quot;Make her 
see that she must serve you and those you care about for as long as you 
deem it. There is some comfort in that, that you will be compensated, 
and the problem is resolved without bloodshed.&quot;

&quot;...But...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about anything else,&quot; he said, standing up slowly. &quot;If you 
would like, you may stay here for awhile, at least until you get your 
bearings. I can arrange it so that you&#39;re roomed with people your age. I 
also think you should speak with that girl who defended everybody 
against your army.&quot;

&quot;Which...one?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; he muttered, &quot;there were two. Well, both, if you can. I 
have you rooming with one; I hope that&#39;s okay. She&#39;s kind of antisocial, 
but she&#39;s just your age, so maybe you two can be friends.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s her name?&quot; asked Sarah.

&quot;Joyce Jameson.&quot;

.........

&quot;Where are we going again?&quot;

&quot;How many times do I have to explain it?!&quot; yelled Rin, exasperated. &quot;I 
need you to help me find somebody&#39;s kid! Look, we don&#39;t know each other 
well, but I hear you can make people really lucky. With Angel&#39;s eyes 
over there, plus Kailin&#39;s extra firepower&#151;no pun intended&#151;we&#39;ll be able 
to find her easy!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I understand,&quot; sighed Aura. Rin had came up to her not 
long ago, asking for her help and not taking no for an answer. She 
figured that the Lady of Luck would be well-suited for the job&#151;that is, 
the job of finding Lady Snowblood&#39;s kidnapped daughter, Kohona&#151;but even 
though it was for a good cause, Valeria still had reason to doubt. In 
the end, Rin was just using her for her power, just like everyone else 
had.

&quot;Look,&quot; sighed Takamatsu, &quot;it&#39;s for a little kid, okay? I hate the idea 
of all these bullies taking this kid hostage and forcing her mother to 
do terrible things. It just makes my skin crawl, ya know? I say that if 
you can do anything about it, you should! Besides, with that creep 
Sashuo gone, the other guys will be a piece of cake!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not fighting anybody,&quot; said Aura.

&quot;I&#39;m not asking you to! Just come with us and help where you can! Look, 
just...please, help me. It would mean so much to me.&quot; Aura was still 
hesitant, but there were indeed times she would step out of her 
boundaries and do jobs like this. If her presence could affect the 
outcome in any way...

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll go, but on one condition. Joyce and that new girl, 
Sarah, have to come along.&quot;

&quot;Oh, the bug lady? Well, I mean...jeez, if that&#39;s what it takes, all 
right. But if she starts calling those things to attack us, I&#39;m not 
gonna be very happy about it! Hsu will fight back, and she&#39;d be better 
suited to kill those things than I would!&quot;

&quot;Just trust me,&quot; Aura stated. &quot;As long as we don&#39;t give her any reason 
to attack us, we&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Rin grudgingly agreed, and was asked to 
wait while Aura retrieved the two younger girls. They hadn&#39;t gotten much 
of an opportunity to know each other&#151;Julie stopped by Sarah&#39;s room to 
apologize and the two ended up being friends&#151;but they would certainly 
get the chance. The Guardian Angel started the search by pointing 
everybody in the general direction of the Crimson Blades, and with luck 
now on their side, they set out on their new quest.

Yohko Kamaguchi didn&#39;t look very pleased when the small team asked to 
borrow one of her transports again, but when she heard the whole story, 
she nearly forced the keys into their hands. Apparently she liked having 
a lot of people working for her. Rin didn&#39;t like being cooped up in the 
large, smelly, clunky van, but she endured it and drove down the empty 
road, following Angel&#39;s navigation. Out of the corner of her eye, she 
saw Joyce and Sarah talking to each other, even smiling and laughing, 
and felt her heart soften just a bit.

It didn&#39;t take them very long to find the Crimson Blade base. The 
remnant was about half its usual size&#151;some had been killed, others fled 
when they heard of Sashuo&#39;s demise. When the team of six climbed out and 
made their presence known to the stragglers, they really couldn&#39;t help 
but feel sorry for the group. Gone was the essence of fear, of power and 
strength, of even any threat or danger. Only a few, here and there, 
stubbornly clung to their heritage; everyone else was pathetic, weak and 
scrawny, as if Sashuo&#39;s absence had taken their very spirits out.

Rin was mildly surprised to see her old &quot;buddy&quot; Snowblood taking charge 
of the band. She called out to the woman using her pet name: &quot;SETSIE!!!! 
It&#39;s me, Rin the Ronin!&quot; Setsuka turned around, unable to hold down the 
smile as she faced Rin. She bowed and beckoned for the woman to come 
over and join her.

&quot;Rin, this is unexpected, and that&#39;s a lot coming from me. How did you 
find us?&quot;

&quot;Angel here!&quot; she exclaimed, giving Kathy a proud slap on the back 
(rocketing the poor girl forward). &quot;She&#39;s got miracle eyes, I tell you 
what! So is this your band?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is. Word has gone round that Sashuo is dead. When I heard it, I 
couldn&#39;t believe it at first. I came here to see if it was true, and I 
could tell that the spirit of violence had left this group. When I came, 
nearly everyone ran out and begged for me to spare them, saying they had 
only followed Sashuo because they were afraid of him. They&#39;ve all sworn 
loyalty to me in exchange for keeping their lives.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So do you know that these guys were the ones who had your 
daughter?&quot;

&quot;I just found that out,&quot; she nodded. &quot;At first I was furious, but after 
hearing their testimony, I couldn&#39;t help but feel pity for them. I 
actually threatened to kill them anyway if they didn&#39;t bring my daughter 
to me, and so they eagerly complied.&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s here?!&quot; Setsuka nodded.

&quot;She&#39;s safe inside my tent. I have a trusted subordinate watching over 
her.&quot;

&quot;Whoa! Hey, that&#39;s awesome! So Sashuo&#39;s dead, these guys are now 
following you, and your daughter&#39;s safe! Man! Things just keep getting 
better for you!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she agreed, smiling softly. &quot;And I couldn&#39;t have done it without 
you, Rin. Is Kailin there? I&#39;d like to thank her as well.&quot;

&quot;No thanks necessary,&quot; answered the young Inferno; &quot;we really didn&#39;t 
kill Sashuo anyway. It was a man named Father Pochanski.&quot; Snowblood 
nodded gravely.

&quot;Then I owe this man my thanks as well. But how he could have done such 
a thing...?&quot;

&quot;He had help,&quot; answered Aura. She first introduced herself, then pointed 
out Angel (whom Setsuka had met a few days earlier), Sarah, and finally 
Joyce, who was shirking behind Sarah. Aura continued solemnly, &quot;Joyce 
has powers that are unbelievable. I&#39;ve seen her use them three times, 
and except for the third time, each one was a devastating spectacle. I 
can&#39;t imagine what they are or how she got them.&quot; Setsuka visibly 
shivered, but calmed herself as she sensed Joyce didn&#39;t like people 
talking about her like that.

&quot;I see. Miss Jameson, I am deeply in your debt. Please, consider me your 
servant, and my daughter as well. We cannot thank you, nor any of you, 
enough for your deeds.&quot; Joyce said nothing, letting out only a squeal of 
sorrow. Snowblood drew in a deep breath and smiled, taking Rin by the 
hand. &quot;But let us rest for awhile! If you are here, we should become 
better acquainted! Much time has passed, and I assume you&#39;ll want to 
meet Kohona. She says you&#39;re her favorite hero now.&quot;

&quot;Who, me?&quot; Rin grinned and blushed, laughing awkwardly as she followed 
the blind woman to her tent. &quot;Well gee! I never figured myself much of a 
role model!&quot; The others were invited to stay in other tents for the 
night, an offer they eagerly accepted, since the hour was late anyway. 
They were wary of the scattered Crimson Blades, but Snowblood assured 
everybody that they would do no harm. Without Sashuo to lead them, they 
were sheep without a shepherd.

Early in the morning, everyone emerged from their tents refreshed, 
although in need of a shower. Rin announced to the group that she had 
made a deal with Setsuka: she and her daughter would join them in the 
MERCS building, at least until they had a more suitable place to stay. 
Needless to say, there were plenty of knowing looks exchanged between 
others as they wondered what else had transpired over the night. After 
bathing and eating, Setsuka asked for everyone else to prepare, but 
something was odd. Several important items were gone, including the coin 
Aura used to magnify her powers, Setsuka&#39;s samisen, Joyce&#39;s teddy bear, 
and most horribly...

&quot;MY SWORD!!!! SOME BASTARD STOLE MY SWORD!!!&quot;

The Takamatsu family blade was missing. Naturally. Rin nearly tore the 
entire base apart looking for it, but all she did was make a mess and 
scare a few Crimson Blades away. Eventually she tired herself out and 
collapsed right on the ground, nearly on the verge of tears. Her friends 
surrounded her and comforted her; Angel volunteered to look for the 
missing items, and began to glow before she could be thanked.

&quot;Goodness gracious!&quot; she exclaimed suddenly. &quot;I see them, all right, but 
there&#39;s something else, too! It seems they are being...spirited away!&quot;

&quot;Huh? Whaddya mean?&quot;

&quot;A...ghost,&quot; she whispered, &quot;or somebody that can become a ghost.&quot; Rin 
and Kailin stared at each other, turning pale as they dared to conceive 
the impossible. Nah, couldn&#39;t be!

&quot;Where at?&quot;

&quot;Less than a mile in that direction,&quot; she pointed. Rin sprinted off in 
the direction, and to everyone&#39;s surprise (except for Kailin), she 
shouted at the very top of her lungs: &quot;Ferret, I know that&#39;s you! Come 
on out and give us back our stuff! Don&#39;t you know, you idiot?! You just 
stole from Rin and Kailin, the great Ronin! Ferret, are you even 
listening to me!?&quot;

Nothing happened for awhile, and people were starting to think Rin had 
finally lost her mind. But about seventy seconds or so later, somebody 
was seen approaching them, carrying a sack. It was a slightly petite 
girl, with braided brown hair and tanned skin, her face colorful with 
emotion. Rin kept her arms crossed until she came near, then broke out 
in a smile. Kailin clapped her hands and skipped over, grinning merrily 
as she saw for the first time the friend they had met while in the 
afterlife. She looked very real, although different than they 
remembered, and very pretty.

&quot;Can it be?&quot; said the girl, setting her sack down. &quot;Is it really Rin and 
Kailin?&quot;

&quot;In the flesh!&quot; exclaimed the older girl (making Kailin roll her eyes 
with her choice of words). The tanned girl gasped in awe and laughed.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it! You really found a way to come back to life! I was 
so worried about you! I couldn&#39;t find you when I ghosted, and I feared 
the worst, but it seems I worried for nothing! How are you, how have you 
been?&quot;

&quot;Swell,&quot; they answered, &quot;but why the hell did you steal from us?&quot; Poor 
Ferret chuckled feebly, rubbing her chocolate hair as she turned red.

&quot;Heheh...old habits. I&#39;m very sorry&#151;I didn&#39;t even know it was you when I 
robbed you&#151;you look so different when you&#39;re not dead&#151;I just...needed 
money, that&#39;s all. I&#39;m kind of short on cash again.&quot;

&quot;Now what did we tell you about stealing, Jo?&quot; snorted Kailin. 
Ferret&#151;Joanna White&#151;laughed again and apologized.

&quot;Yes, I know, but it&#39;s the only thing I&#39;m good at. I&#39;m very sorry. Here, 
let me give you your things back.&quot; To each woman there he returned their 
goods&#151;Aura her coin, Setsuka her samisen, Joyce her bear, and Rin her 
sword. Naturally nobody thought well of Ferret at the moment (a few were 
beginning to think she was more of a rat), but eventually her good 
nature won them over and earned their trust, though from that day on 
they kept a careful eye on their valuables when she was around.

Joanna was quickly acquainted with everyone and told the situation. She 
was quite surprised to hear how her friends revived, though was not told 
the conditions they had to fulfill for it. She was less surprised to 
hear that they were all (or were going to) staying with Dr. Kamaguchi in 
the MERCS building, but as she said, &quot;there&#39;s no better place to go to 
when you&#39;re in debt.&quot;

&quot;Why not come with us and stay there for awhile?&quot; Kailin offered. &quot;I&#39;m 
sure the doctor wouldn&#39;t mind, and you did say you needed financial 
help. Besides, we may need your skills.&quot; Joanna gave her usual watery 
smile and rubbed her neck, a sign that she was embarrassed.

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t want me. I&#39;m nothing more than a thief, not suited for 
battling anything evil. Besides, I&#39;ve done far worse things under the 
employ of that woman; I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;ll have me do if I chose to 
come back.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your decision,&quot; said Aura, touching her hand. Joanna&#39;s brownish 
face turned red from the contact; seeing Aura&#39;s gentle face smiling only 
made things worse.

&quot;Umm...well, I would love to find a place to stay, and it would be nice 
to hang out with these two, but I&#39;m not sure how welcome I&#39;d be.&quot;

&quot;As welcome as any of us,&quot; noted Kailin. She nodded over to Sarah and 
Joyce, who had been quiet the entire time. &quot;I don&#39;t know these two well, 
but I&#39;ve been told they like to keep to themselves. Even so, they have 
people among them who care for them. I&#39;m sure that if you come, everyone 
will like your company.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t understand,&quot; murmured Joanna, hanging her head in 
shame. &quot;It&#39;s more complex than you think. I just...don&#39;t belong 
anywhere.&quot;

&quot;There are many among us who would say the same,&quot; said Aura, taking her 
hand again. &quot;In essence, all people with our skills don&#39;t &#145;belong&#39;. 
We&#39;re set apart from normal human beings. I suppose this sense of 
isolation can bring even us together. I&#39;d be glad to have you; I can 
tell you&#39;re a good person, even if you are a thief.&quot; Joanna&#39;s face was 
now as red as Bloodbane&#39;s arsenal; she stammered under the gaze of the 
beautiful younger girl.

&quot;I-if you insist,&quot; she managed. &quot;Though I hope you forgive me if I keep 
to myself.&quot;

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;I know we can all be good 
friends!&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes...&quot; It seemed that the Ferret would come with them, as would 
Snowblood and her daughter, so after the team packed their bags they set 
out. Before leaving, Setsuka announced to the Crimson Blades that they 
were freed from her command and the command of anybody else, so long as 
they no longer caused anybody pain. They agreed and dispersed, and as 
far as anybody knew, that was the very last of them. It was tough for 
the group of women and girls to crowd inside the van&#151;their numbers had 
increased by three&#151;but the addition of two others, both of them worthy 
allies, made the discomfort lessen.

.........

Mora Johsen, feeling rather foul, stormed into Lyn Shival&#39;s room with a 
look of pure rage on her face. Apparently their sparring session earlier 
was not quite concluded, and the Cobra was looking to settle the score. 
When she burst in, Shival was just adjusting her brassiere for a bit of 
normal work, leaving most of her upper body naked. Cobra herself still 
had her fighting clothes, worn and torn significantly from their last 
battle. She almost spat in Lyn&#39;s face as she stormed over and grabbed 
her.

&quot;You! Think I&#39;m done with you yet!? Don&#39;t you even think that just 
because you won, that means I&#39;m beaten! I want a rematch, you selfish 
silver-haired bitch! A battle to the finish!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Lyn murmured, &quot;but I&#39;m not interested. Go waste your hot air 
somewhere else.&quot;

&quot;Hot air?! I&#39;ll show you hot air!&quot; Mora struck Lyn hard, sending her 
falling to the floor, where she wrestled her to the ground and slapped 
her in the face several times. Bloodbane hadn&#39;t been in a very bad mood 
up until then, but being attacked needlessly brought out the animal in 
her. She fought back with all her strength, even biting and scratching. 
Blows were exchanged and clothes were yanked, torn, and twisted as the 
two women battled each other. Mora finally caught Lyn in her arms, and 
flung her onto the bed with all her might.

&quot;And stay down!&quot; But Lyn was a fighter; she scrambled up and pulled Mora 
along with her. She managed to squirm so that she was pinning the older 
woman, and struck her face several times. She then bent down and, to 
Mora&#39;s anger and surprise, licked her cheek. Her tongue found its way 
into Mora&#39;s mouth, and the two embraced with all the acidic hatred they 
bore each other. What remained of their clothes was quickly discarded, 
and after fighting each other to the door to shut and lock it, they 
returned to the bed, still hitting each other in between gropes and 
kisses.

&quot;You want some hate sex, huh?&quot; growled Lyn. &quot;You picked the wrong flower 
to prune, you snake! I&#39;ll make you regret ever coming in here!&quot;

&quot;Too late, I already do!&quot; She reached up and squeezed Lyn&#39;s breasts; it 
was hard to determine whether their violence was sexual or spiteful in 
nature. After exchanging more barbs the two got down to business, and 
relieved themselves of the tension that had built up, perhaps their 
original intent. In any case, they both wore out, somewhat to their 
disappointment, and laid there bruised, sweaty, and naked, their chests 
heaving for air.

&quot;Damn,&quot; spat Mora, &quot;you...held out...longer...than I thought!&quot;

&quot;You really are...an animal,&quot; added Lyn. They faced each other and 
glared.

&quot;I still hate you, you know.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I detest you too. I&#39;ve never met a more despicable woman!&quot;

&quot;Shut up...stupid!&quot; All this amidst kisses, moaning, and feeble 
grabbing; nobody could say how long this went on since thankfully, there 
were no witnesses.

Several rooms over, Alisti Kreager sneezed.

Watch out you don&#39;t turn into an imp, Skye advised her. Alisti smiled.

IMP?

You turn into one if you sneeze and somebody isn&#39;t there to put a charm 
on you. My teacher told me that. He said that sneezing causes the heart 
to contract and the body to assume a more mystical appearance. If a 
person sneezes enough times without being charmed, the transformation 
becomes permanent. Kreager rolled her eyes.

WEIRDO.

I know, it&#39;s a funny superstition, but it&#39;s one of my good memories.

BAD, Alisti said, gesturing towards herself. ONLY.

I&#39;m sure you have good memories too.

NO. NONE.

What about your family?

CURSED! She thrashed around as best she could, indicating the damned 
circumstance she had been born into. DAMNED...BORN! HELPLESS! 
MIRACLE...SURVIVED! MIND...DESTROYED. LEFT...LIKE...THIS! HELPLESS! 
MOVEMENT...SPEECH...THOUGHT...GONE! POWERS...COMPENSATION. 
NOBODY...SUSPECTS...ANYTHING. PUNISHMENT...WORLD!

You have led a sad life, Skye sighed, resting a hand on Alisti&#39;s 
shoulder. Not being able to speak didn&#39;t matter if the other person had 
telekinetic abilities, of which Alisti did. Skye merely needed to think, 
and she could be understood&#151;perhaps that, or pity, was what kept her in 
Kreager&#39;s company. But I&#39;m going to take care of you, she added. Alisti 
made a face.

WHY?

Because you need it. And because I need a friend, somebody I can talk 
to. Everyone else leaves me alone.

MARISSA.

She spends her time with Sanaa, noted Skye with a smirk.

LURKER. RANCOR. STALKER. LOST.

Yes, they do make an effort to befriend me. But I feel more needed with 
you.

PITY? Skye sighed sadly.

A bit. I just want to help. Alisti snorted.

PITY...WASTED.

At least let me be your friend.

WASTE.

Please don&#39;t push me away, Alisti. Please. She touched the girl&#39;s 
scraggly hair, making her wince in revulsion. She swatted at Skye with 
her only operable hand, but the other girl didn&#39;t get the message. She 
took Kreager&#39;s hand and held it, rubbing her thumb against her fingers. 
Alisti calmed down a little, looked away, and scoffed.

WASTEFUL. LEAVE. LEAVE!!

I&#39;m not leaving. You need somebody to take care of you. I want to do 
this, Alisti.

PLENTY...CARETAKERS.

Then...let me be more. Skye knelt down a little and kissed Alisti&#39;s 
forehead, then slowly moved to her cheek, then looked the girl in the 
eyes. Alisti howled and bucked in anger, but Skye could see that she was 
only mad at herself, a failure and a mistake, perhaps the greatest 
mistake of them all. But didn&#39;t the rejected, the ones cast out, the 
despised need love too? Didn&#39;t Alisti deserve that chance as well? Skye 
took a risk by holding Kreager&#39;s hand, and she took another risk by 
kissing her. She placed her lips on Kreager&#39;s twisted mouth, pressing 
gently to assure the girl of her devotion. When she pulled back, she 
noticed that Alisti was crying.

LOVE...? she seemed to wonder. Skye smiled weakly and nodded.

Yes, Alisti. Love.

......

When 5:59 became 6:00, Shalis Torth woke up instantly, as she always 
had. It was still dark outside, but light was slowly starting to filter 
into the room. Her eyes did not need to adjust to the darkness, because 
they were always adjusted, and could see clearly in any setting. They 
noticed the resting body nearby, still asleep and breathing quietly. 
Shalis badly wanted to take the woman into her arms, artificial as they 
were, and kiss her and touch her everywhere, but she knew such love 
between them was impossible. As much as she cared for Namie, she could 
not have her, at least not in a physical sense. Their love would have to 
suffice on another level&#151;physical pleasure would never be theirs. Not 
even a kiss...

Namie stirred as Shalis&#39; arms materialized and launched her out of her 
bed. She woke up five minutes later, groggy and weary but very 
peaceful-looking (and quite sexy, Shalis had to admit, dressed in her 
skintight pale-blue bodysuit). Her head was resting on an acid-resistant 
pillow Shalis had created; the sheets were more or less the same fabric 
that Namie wore, so even they would not corrode. Once or twice Shalis 
had been burnt during the night as she touched Namie&#39;s face, though, but 
the scars were small and healed quickly. She had managed to make do with 
her lover&#39;s condition, and for that, Namie was grateful. She got out of 
bed after smelling breakfast, and stumbled over to the older woman, 
wrapping her arms around her body.

&quot;Huahhh,&quot; she yawned. &quot;Morning, sunshine and joy.&quot;

&quot;Hello, Namie. Sleep well?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, I guess. It&#39;s still...early,&quot; she yawned again. Shalis smiled and 
kissed her shoulder, then placed her holographic hand over the woman&#39;s 
mouth and kissed it, the best they could hope for. Namie seemed to 
revive and even managed a sexy little stare. &quot;I&#39;m gonna take a shower. 
Wanna join me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve love to, but my body wouldn&#39;t handle it. I&#39;m not waterproof, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;So how do you clean yourself?&quot;

&quot;Very carefully,&quot; she answered. Namie raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Sponge baths?&quot;

&quot;No, special equipment designed just for me.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Are you sure you&#39;re not just backing out on me?&quot; Shalis held up her 
artificial hand, giving her lover a handsome smile.

&quot;Trust me. I would if I could.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure our boss could arrange something,&quot; Namie whispered, her voice 
sultry and yearning. Shalis still didn&#39;t know why Namie loved her so, 
but if it was her choice, then she would accept it and return the favor. 
It was the least she could do!

&quot;Speaking of which,&quot; Shalis said, noticing the presence of their master. 
Namie turned around and put on a cheerful smile, standing without shame 
in her bodysuit, which may have well been nothing at all. Shalis was 
barely presentable herself, but that didn&#39;t seem to matter. Their boss 
didn&#39;t discriminate on their choice of, or lack of, apparel.

&quot;Good morning, ladies,&quot; he said as he appeared. Whether the smile on his 
face was real or not, it seemed to convey a sense of comfort and warmth. 
Namie and even Shalis smiled back, greeting him with a loving bow.

&quot;Good morning, Mr. White.&quot;
