Chronicle Three - respect and/or hatred, the Garden of EDEN

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

If a Meta Suit was to Leviathan what an ant was to a human, then the 
Leviathan was to EDEN what a human was to a city. Yumi had thought that 
the Leviathan itself was large. But EDEN was just something else. From a 
distance it looked like an oil refinery. But once the Leviathan had 
gotten closer to the structure, Yumi and Chizuru could clearly see that 
that was not the case. It was a fortress city. Covering over one square 
mile of territory, deep in the middle of the pacific ocean. The entire 
city was held up from the sea by a series of metal underwater pillars. 
Ones that reached all the way down to the bottom of sea level. Once the 
Leviathan came to the edge of the way, the people at the helm made 
contact with those at one of the fifteen Control Rooms of the rebel 
city. The operatives there knew of the Leviathan. And so didn&#39;t even 
request proof of identity. The gigantic bay overhanging the inner hanger 
opened up into two sections. Both doors separating underneath the ship 
while beacon lights were flashing across the east &#39;deck&#39; of EDEN&#39;s 
ground level landing bay. The Leviathan was cleared for entry so it 
landed into the east hanger through those opening doors.  The ship 
control centre of the Chrysalis slowly descended from above to the 
darker innards of one of the four EDEN hangers. Dozens of men and women 
yelled to each other with handheld beacon lights to help guide the ship 
down. A good ten minutes later the ship safely touched ground, the 
connection between the two echoing loudly. Despite the fact that it was 
made with the lightest defensively sound alloys known to man, the 
Leviathan weighed at least 800 tons. Such a loud sound was inevitable. 
It was decided by Commander Beatrix that only a few people would 
disembark, herself included. Their main priorities were restocking the 
Leviathan with arms and fuel, repairing and upgrading their Gusions and 
Uvalls. Besides that, this trip back was only for showing Yumi to the 
leader of both EDEN and the Ark of the Luria. Father Bartholomeus.

From the side hull of the ship, one of the doors slowly opened up. The 
metal door extended outwardly until its tip touched the floor of the 
hanger, 30 metres below. Out from that came Beatrix and Sophia. Behind 
them was Yumi, Chizuru and Terry. And behind those three were a few 
others that would be coming with them. The others of Chrysalis would 
remain on the Leviathan until the commander came back. Yumi descended 
down the steps of the extended door, then looked over to her left. From 
the lower left of the Leviathan, its large side doors into the Meta Suit 
hanger had been opened. She could see the large mechas Oriax and 
Bishamon being moved out of the ship via a moving conveyer belt and 
guiding energy beams. But Yumi didn&#39;t know how she felt when she looked 
at it. The Oriax had caused her to leave Meta Tokyo and safety. Did she 
feel connected to that thing regardless of that? 

Chizuru put a hand on Yumi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Hey. Are you okay? I know that 
this must all be a little... overwhelming for you.&quot;

&quot;...I-I&#39;m fine,&quot; Yumi answered, &quot;...I think I&#39;m more concerned about 
you, Chizuru. It&#39;s because of me that you&#39;ve been dragged into all of 
this. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t apologize. I&#39;m okay with it. As long as I&#39;m here with you.&quot;

Yumi turned a tiny little smile and blushed, while Terry looked ahead 
towards the far wall of this hanger. &quot;...I&#39;ll be taking the pair of you 
to see Father Bartholomeus. I think you&#39;ll find him to be an interesting 
man. We think very highly of him here.&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Chizuru said, &quot;Why am I coming? Not that I mind or anything.&quot;

Terry crossed his arms over his chest. &quot;You&#39;re Yumi&#39;s friend, aren&#39;t 
you? I know from experience that people feel more comfortable in foreign 
places when they have someone familiar around. The two of you should 
stick together here. EDEN can be a little intimidating when you&#39;re on 
your own.&quot;

Chizuru looked at Terry. It seems that comment meant more than he gave 
off. She could tell that Terry had felt that way when he first came 
here. The brave pilot of Chrysalis probably wasn&#39;t always so brave. The 
group came off the long stepping way and touched their feet to the steel 
of EDEN. A few men were already at hand to greet Commander Beatrix and 
Major Mariette when they arrived. Beatrix addressed them for a moment 
then left with the others to go about her business. They would only be 
stopping on EDEN for a few days. After that they would move onto their 
next mission. They marched from one side of that extremely large hanger 
over to the furthest wall. To the south. The eighteen-metre tall doors 
into the steel citadel opened for them when they came to it. This led 
them to a separate corridor of the layout. It was a big forked hallway 
that they came to. 

Beatrix closed her eyes. &quot;Lieutenant Hennig.&quot;

&quot;Uh? Yes, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;...Please take Miss Mishima and Miss Matsubana with you to see Father 
Bartholomeus. No delays. I am sure that he is eager to meet with them.&quot;

Terry saluted his commander. &quot;Yes, Colonel Beatrix.&quot;

Beatrix turned to Sophia. &quot;Major Mariette? You&#39;ll be coming with me.&quot;

&quot;Roger.&quot;

Then the group split into three. Yumi, Terry and Chizuru marched 
straight ahead with Terry in the lead to direct them to Bartholomeus&#39; 
quarters. While the Chrysalis operatives along with them turned to the 
right to reach one of the control rooms. It was them who would be 
organizing the repairs necessary for the Leviathan and the Meta Suits it 
had on hand. Beatrix and Sophia turned to the left. And kept walking 
until they found a quiet side room for utilities. Beatrix took a key 
card out of her pocket and swiped it through the control panel. Then 
opened the door. They walked in and closed the door behind them. The two 
then stared at each other for a moment. Then lunged at each other. Their 
lips connected with a burning swiftness that truly displayed how 
passionate they were about each other. Sophia moaned whilst Beatrix 
pressed her hard up against the door of the utilities room. And they 
kissed fervently. Sophia wrapped her arms around the taller Beatrix&#39;s 
shoulders and neck. And moaned again when she felt the older woman slip 
her tongue between her lips. The commander of Chrysalis ran her thigh 
between the younger woman&#39;s legs and parted her dark green military 
skirt. Though her smooth pantyhose Beatrix could feel Sophia&#39;s wetness 
as clear as day. The musky smell of it began to rise into the air, 
joining the sound effects of their lips smacking against each other. As 
well as the light moans and the sound of their uniforms being ruffled in 
the embrace. Finally Sophia broke their kiss, gasping for breath, 
feeling Beatrix&#39;s strong hand cupping her left breast through the fabric 
of her uniform.

&quot;...Cecelia...&quot; Sophia muttered breathlessly. 

Beatrix pressed the tip of her finger to Sophia&#39;s lips to shush her, all 
the while her thigh was stroking up and down the blue-haired girl&#39;s 
underwear-masked vulva. &quot;...Don&#39;t say anything. I probably should have 
waited until we got to my room. But we have so little privacy on the 
Leviathan. I suppose I just... couldn&#39;t control myself.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Sophia admitted, &quot;I feel the same way, Cecelia. We must 
keep this a secret from the troops. It could cause complications if we 
don&#39;t. And I can&#39;t honestly say that your grandfather would approve. But 
I&#39;m okay with that. As long as I can be with you... even for just a 
brief few minutes at a time.&quot;

Although she didn&#39;t often do so, Beatrix smiled. Lustfully. &quot;Oh, Sophia. 
Hearing you speak like that... makes this so much harder...&quot;

Then she instantly dove at the flesh of the girl&#39;s neck. Sophia moaned 
aloud and held onto the taller woman, feeling that stroke between her 
thighs increase in pace. And while they expressed their &#39;love&#39; in that 
particular utilities closet; Terry, Yumi and Chizuru had made it to the 
door of Bartholomeus&#39; room. Thankfully he didn&#39;t reside too far from the 
east hanger. The three of them waited at the door of the corridor until 
Terry knocked on it. A light flashed on the control panel. One that 
indicated that the door was already open. So he pressed the button and 
it shifted to one side. Terry, Yumi and Chizuru walked inside and 
marvelled at its innards.  It was a large chamber. At least fifty by 
fifty-five metres in size. The floors were covered in oriental rugs and 
multi-coloured throw pillows. While the walls were decorated with 
scrolls that depicted direct Latin excerpts from the Bible. Over to the 
far wall of the room was an altar. Four candles of incense burned from 
it, and that particular smell wafted around the room. Yumi didn&#39;t like 
it much but she could tolerate it. Just before the altar there was a 
wooden chair. And on that chair was a certain man. An elderly man that 
looked to be about seventy years of age sat on that chair like a throne. 
His regal black and gold robes extended all the way to his sandaled 
feet. And his long grey beard trailed down to his lap. 

Yumi stared at him. &quot;...Are you... Father Bartholomeus?&quot;

Terry nodded. &quot;Uh huh. This is our absolute leader. Bartholomeus 
Beatrix.&quot;  

Chizuru blinked. &quot;Beatrix? Does that mean that you...?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; This time Bartholomeus answered her, &quot;...commander of the mobile 
army Chrysalis; Cecelia Faye Beatrix, is my granddaughter. I am very 
pleased to be meeting you... Miss Yumi Mishima.&quot;

&quot;O-of course,&quot; Yumi gestured towards Chizuru, &quot;this is... Chizuru 
Matsubana.&quot;

Chizuru bowed her head to the Father for a moment. &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet 
you, sir. I hope it&#39;s okay that I came with Yumi.&quot;

Father Bartholomeus stared at her for a moment, then bobbed his head in 
the exact same way, replying with his extensive, lingering voice of 
wisdom. &quot;Think nothing of it, my dear. EDEN is a home for humanity. 
Rejection of residence is not our way of life. And I am glad that you 
have both reached here in good condition. The teams of soldiers sent out 
by Protocol often track escapees from the Meta Cities without fail.&quot;

&quot;What about the people of EDEN?&quot; Asked Yumi. 

&quot;Out of the 950,000 people that live in the citadel,&quot; began the priest, 
&quot;less than 2% of them were born in Meta Cities. They only managed to 
join us because of the cloaking abilities of the Leviathan. They escaped 
to it and were able to flee to EDEN. Which I am grateful for. Because 
people should have the option to escape the current way of life in the 
Meta Cities.&quot;

Chizuru ran a hand through her hair. &quot;So you built EDEN for that?&quot;

Bartholomeus smiled. &quot;...The name EDEN is an abbreviation of four Latin 
words. The first e is for &#39;Ecclesia&#39; which means Church. The d is for 
&#39;Deduco&#39; which means to found a colony. The second is e is for &#39;Enimus&#39; 
which means at a distance. Finally the n is for &#39;Natio&#39;, which means 
nation. My way of thinking, the Ark of the Luria, is based upon 
contemporary Christian teachings. Those shackled to a force that it 
cannot quite agree with should be given the opportunity to shirk it, if 
they wish.&quot;

&quot;...And what makes your way any different from Protocol&#39;s? It&#39;s not like 
Christianity has always been a force for good.&quot; Chizuru asked directly. 

&quot;That is a fair comment,&quot; Bartholomeus said, &quot;but to judge the dogma of 
a faith by the way the followers of that faith carry them out is quite 
unfair. Ark of the Luria offers choice above all else. From Protocol 
comes the strain of which we are afflicted.&quot;

Chizuru locked eyes with him. &quot;But you&#39;re prepared to remove a choice in 
life by defeating Protocol, aren&#39;t you? Where&#39;s the option in that?&quot;

&quot;...For many years we have sought to co-exist with the rule of Protocol. 
All we asked was that those who do not wish to live under its reign were 
given rights to govern themselves outside of Protocol&#39;s sphere of 
influence. And we were denied that entitlement. Thus forced to live out 
our lives in seclusion, afforded less rights than those of a criminal. 
People who dislike Protocol&#39;s system of governing were reduced to no 
more than political radicals. And so we were forced to flee elsewhere. 
To build a free nation of our own. That is EDEN. But there are still 
billions of people suffering Protocol&#39;s tyranny. For those people to 
gain freedom... the chains that restrain them must be broken.&quot;

&quot;But what have I got to do with that?&quot; Yumi wondered, &quot;Terry said that 
Protocol had some sort of interest in me. If they do then what is it? 
I&#39;m just a normal college student.&quot;

&quot;...Well,&quot; The old man began, &quot;...I cannot honestly tell you that I am 
in the know of Protocol&#39;s plans. But what little I do know... I will 
share. According to the teachings of Protocol&#39;s scholars; thousands of 
years ago there was a time when humanity was deeply connected to each 
other. A time when life was plentiful and we understood how to live in 
harmonious balance with nature. This was overseen by what Protocol calls 
a &#39;God&#39; and was supposedly a period of great kinship and knowledge. 
However. There was a sole human being who sought to monopolize the 
shared knowledge of humanity. That person attempted it. Thus shattering 
both the inter-connections between men and the correlation with that 
&#39;God&#39;. But it did not escape unscathed. It was corrupted by that act, 
which Protocol calls the &#39;Second Sin&#39;. That corruption caused it to 
become imperfect. The God then seems to have died because of those 
imperfections. I think that Protocol now seeks to... resurrect that 
God.&quot;

Though this was supposedly the first time that Yumi and Chizuru were 
hearing this story, it was Yumi who was startled by it. &quot;They actually 
want to... resurrect a God?&quot;

&quot;...Or rather an organism that acts in God&#39;s place,&quot; Bartholomeus 
replied, &quot;the events of the death of Protocol&#39;s God took place in the 
space of seven days. And that week is known as The Seven Keys.&quot;
 
Yumi became thoughtful. &quot;The Seven Keys...?&quot; 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Chizuru asked.

&quot;I received an e-mail yesterday morning,&quot; She admitted, &quot;I thought that 
it was junk. But it did mention something about the Seven Keys. I 
remember that.&quot;

Bartholomeus smiled. &quot;I see that the e-mail I had my followers send 
actually reached your computer.&quot;

&quot;That was you?&quot;

The modern Christian man nodded. &quot;Yes. Because although it might not 
seem it, Yumi, you are an integral part of their plans to revive this 
God of theirs. So I must ask you. Have you ever dealt with Protocol in 
the past? Do you have any idea as to what they plan to do with you?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Yumi said softly, &quot;...I mean... I&#39;ve dealt with Protocol no more 
than any average person has... as far as I know I&#39;ve never been 
heavily... involved with them.&quot;

Bartholomeus pulled up an eyebrow. &quot;As far as you know...?&quot;

&quot;...Well... I don&#39;t have many memories... before the age of thirteen. So 
I don&#39;t know what happened... until then. I have... no parents now. I 
think I can... recall a father... but I don&#39;t even remember his face, 
let alone his name. There are instances... when I see myself as a 
younger girl. I... see myself crying. And... my dress is... covered in 
blood... with... c-corpses all around me... but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a 
dream... or a... memory...&quot;

Father Bartholomeus ran his fingers through his beard. &quot;...I see. It 
might be possible that you had contact with Protocol before you lost 
your memories of the past. But make no mistake about it. Our sources are 
sure that you are important to them. I feel that way also. Even now I 
can sense tremendous inner strength from you, Yumi. And if I might be so 
bold... I would like to make a request?&quot;

&quot;...A... request...?&quot;

&quot;...We need your strength,&quot; He said, &quot;to stop Protocol. And you need a 
home to reside in from now on. I would like to ask you to assume 
citizenship on EDEN... and assume a role as a member of Chrysalis.&quot;

Yumi&#39;s eyes enlarged. &quot;...Join Chrysalis...?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Will you help us?&quot;

There was a sudden flash of that dream/memory image of a child Yumi, her 
dress stained in blood, running through the hacker&#39;s mind at that point. 
With it came a throbbing pain in her skull. Yumi grabbed her head and 
scowled, but retained her glance on Father Bartholomeus. &quot;...Y-you mean 
become y-your soldier!?&quot;

&quot;No, Miss Mishima, that is not what I-&quot;

&quot;W-well it seems like it to m-me!&quot; Yumi cried loudly, her cranium in 
pain, &quot;I have this... horrible power inside of me! One that controlled 
me into killing someone! I won&#39;t do that again! I&#39;m NOT a killer! I just 
want to be a normal girl! I won&#39;t be a murderer for you or for 
Protocol!&quot;

Bartholomeus sighed at that declaration, looking downwards. Terry, who 
had said quiet throughout all this, now spoke up. &quot;C&#39;mon, Yumi. I know 
that this is hard, believe me I do, but if these guys really wanna bring 
back some dead deity from the grave, you know that isn&#39;t not gonna be a 
good thing. For all we know it could give them unlimited power. But we 
could stop them. If you&#39;d join us we would be so much better off. We 
could-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my concern!&quot; Yumi shouted, &quot;...I just want to be normal!&quot;

&quot;Well... believe it or not, you aren&#39;t,&quot; Terry retorted, &quot;you&#39;ve got a 
power inside of you that can protect both you and those around you. Even 
if it means sacrificing yourself, aren&#39;t you prepared to defend those 
who have no means to defend themselves?&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s not my concern...&quot; Yumi repeated.

Now Terry found himself getting angry. &quot;...So you&#39;ll just sit back and 
whimper when innocent people are crying out for help that you know you 
could give? You&#39;d turn your back to the millions of men, women and 
children trapped inside the Meta Cities just like you were up until 
yesterday?!&quot;

Yumi looked away, averting his gaze. &quot;...Why should I care about the 
lives of others... when I don&#39;t even care about my own...?&quot;

A loud snarl tore through the room. Followed by the palm of Terry&#39;s hand 
when he slapped Yumi across the face. The white-haired teen yelped and 
fell backwards. Chizuru gasped and quickly kneeled to her side, while 
Father Bartholomeus looked on with shock. Terry lowered his hand and 
scowled, ignoring Yumi&#39;s tears. And the one of his own that ran down his 
left cheek.

&quot;You... fucking... coward!&quot; He barked, &quot;...you&#39;re no different than 
those Protocol bastards! If you can stand there and tell me that you&#39;d 
ignore the suffering of others just so you can feel better about 
yourself then you&#39;re worse than they are! If you wanna stay there and 
sulk then that&#39;s your own goddamned prerogative! But don&#39;t you DARE 
expect pity from me!&quot;

The half-American, half-German youth turned his back to the sobbing Yumi 
and marched out of the room, walking out through the doorway.  Chizuru 
cuddled Yumi by the shoulders, while Father Bartholomeus stood up from 
his chair with a sad expression. 

&quot;Please... forgive him,&quot; He said to the pair, &quot;...Terry Hennig is a 
good, kind-hearted boy. But there can be times when his anger will run 
away with him.&quot;

Chizuru helped Yumi back up into a standing position, holding her fast, 
while saying, &quot;What the hell is his problem? If Yumi doesn&#39;t wanna 
fight, then...&quot; 

The elderly priest looked on solemnly. &quot;...He has a problem with people 
who possess power... but choose not to use it for the greater good. His 
childhood was... very traumatic. Not unlike yours I assume, Yumi.&quot;

Yumi held a hand to the bruise on her cheek. &quot;...Like me...?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Terry has no parents. They were both killed when his village was 
caught in the middle of a Meta Suit training exercise. I am told that he 
was only eight or nine years of age when it happened. The proctors of 
that examination were Protocolian pilots working for a constabulary from 
the nearby Meta City. However... they did not act. And Terry&#39;s entire 
village was destroyed. Out of the 500 people living in the village at 
that time, Terry is thought to be the only one who survived. They were 
all killed in the crossfire. Including his much loved parents. Ever 
since then he has had a crippling hatred of those who abuse power... and 
those who shirk the responsibilities that come with it. I think the two 
of you might be able to understand each other better than I ever could.&quot;

Yumi held her sore cheek and cast a glance back at the door. All this 
time and yet the blonde youth had been dealing with the same loneliness 
as she had. &quot;...Terry...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
 
&quot;Have I not kept this in reserve 
   and sealed it in my vaults? 
It is mine to avenge; I will repay. 
   In due time their foot will slip; 
their day of disaster is near 
   and their doom rushes upon them.&quot;

Deuteronomy 32:17 - &#39;The Song of Moses&#39;  

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Night fell on the quiet pacific seas around EDEN.

It had been at least twenty hours since the Leviathan had landed in the 
hanger, and Yumi &amp; the others had disembarked. Twenty hours since Yumi 
and Chizuru had spoken with Father Bartholomeus about Protocol. Twenty 
hours since Terry&#39;s outburst. Yumi hadn&#39;t seen him since then. 
Thankfully one of Bartholomeus&#39; other attendants showed she and Chizuru 
around in place of him. They had been allowed to check out a few things 
inside EDEN. But it was the size of a small city, so she couldn&#39;t see 
everything that it had to offer. But that was okay for now. By the time 
night had come down on EDEN, Yumi had finished her touring of the 
structure. She just wanted some air and the truth was that she couldn&#39;t 
concentrate on the layout of the place. All day she had been thinking 
about what Terry had said. And what Father Bartholomeus had asked of 
her. Which was why she went out to the upper level of EDEN. She found 
herself on a small metal balcony sticking outwardly from the eastern 
side of the city. From there she could look down and gaze at waves of 
the sea, crashing against the pillars holding up EDEN. Or look out unto 
the setting of the night and the stars that sparkled in it. 

The night was so very beautiful. 

But always associated with darkness.

Yumi couldn&#39;t help but feel that she too was experiencing something of a 
similar situation. This power boiling within her body was very 
influential and important. But it had brought her nothing other than 
insecurity and fear. Could she really use it to fight? She didn&#39;t want 
to kill people. She could spare lives on the battlefield... but what was 
to say that that power wouldn&#39;t overtake her again and kill them anyway? 
There was no assurance that in the heat of battle, she would be able to 
keep her cool. If killing one man instantaneously was just the tip of 
her strength, then it was truly frightening to think that something 
worse would happen if she lost all control. But she could make a 
difference with this power. Could Yumi really turn her back on the 
people out there who wanted to be saved from Protocol?

Yumi leaned idly over the red-painted railing of the metal balcony and 
sighed. 

&quot;What should I do...?&quot; She whispered. 

A male voice called out to her from behind. &quot;...Yumi?&quot;

She knew that particular voice. The white-haired girl looked up when she 
heard that certain someone lean their elbows on the railing like she had 
done. It was Terry. The blonde boy looked out unto the sea and stars, 
admiring them.

&quot;...Beautiful, isn&#39;t it? The scene from here.&quot;

Yumi watched it. &quot;...Yes.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry I hit you, Yumi.&quot; Terry apologized, &quot;I had no right to do 
that. And I should know better. My mom always told me never to hit a 
girl. It&#39;s just... sometimes I get angrier than I want. I find it hard 
coping with certain views. So I lash out. A shrink in the medical area 
told me that I have unresolved mental issues brought on by trauma. But I 
guess using that as an excuse would make me the coward.&quot;

Yumi lowered her head. &quot;...Don&#39;t... apologize, Terry. What you said was 
true. I... suppose I wasn&#39;t being very considerate. There are other 
people with similar problems to my own... at least in a psychological 
sense.&quot;

Terry pulled a grim smile. &quot;The Father told you then, huh?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; Yumi said in earnest, &quot;I know that it can&#39;t have been 
easy. To watch your village be destroyed. And growing up without your 
parents. I know how... lonely that feels.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s pathetic, isn&#39;t it? It happened over eleven years ago... but I 
still can&#39;t move on. I remember... after those Meta Suits went home, I 
was too afraid to leave. The village had been burned down but I couldn&#39;t 
leave my Dad&#39;s corpse. My mom&#39;s body was nowhere to be seen. But I saw 
her get killed. I spent an hour by my dead dad&#39;s corpse because I was 
too afraid to leave the place that had been home to me up until then. 
When I finally stopped crying I got myself together. I dug a grave, 
buried my dad, then left. I drifted for days in the forests without so 
much a slice of bread to eat. I collapsed from exhaustion at some point. 
By the time I woke up I was in another village. A woman had found me in 
the forest and took me with her to her home.&quot;

&quot;A woman?&quot;

Terry widened his grim smile. &quot;...Colonel Beatrix. But that was before 
she had become colonel. She was visiting a friend at that village and 
was helping her pick herbs when she found me. Though she doesn&#39;t always 
seem it... Colonel Beatrix is a kind woman. When it became obvious that 
I had no home to go back to, she let me come with her to EDEN. Which was 
when I came to regard this place as my new home.&quot;

&quot;I understand,&quot; Claimed Yumi, &quot;but then... why did you become a pilot? 
If I had been in your position I would have hated Meta Suits from my 
heart.&quot;

&quot;What would be the point of that, though? The Meta Suits were powerful. 
But power isn&#39;t good or bad. It doesn&#39;t govern itself. Tragedy is caused 
by people who abuse power by using it the wrong way. I&#39;m not arrogant 
enough to say that I&#39;d know the right way to manipulate power. But... my 
mom taught me well enough to know the difference between right and 
wrong. And Protocol are wrong. They have to be stopped before they do 
that to anymore innocent children. That&#39;s why I became a pilot. I&#39;d give 
anything to assure that no other little boy would have to make that 
choice.&quot;

Yumi smiled gently whilst looking at the sea. Father Bartholomeus was 
right. Terry really was a kind-hearted guy. &quot;...I can respect that, 
Terry.&quot;

The Hennig boy exhaled and turned, facing Yumi. He placed his hands on 
her shoulders, turning her around to face him. He gazed honestly at her. 
&quot;Yumi. You don&#39;t have to fight if you don&#39;t want to. Like I said before, 
I didn&#39;t bring you here to force you into anything  you didn&#39;t wanna do. 
Whatever you choose... I&#39;ll support you in it. I think that&#39;s the least 
I can for you. Of course...&quot;

Terry&#39;s bright smile finally returned. &quot;...fighting alongside a pretty 
girl wouldn&#39;t be so bad, right?&quot; 

Yumi blushed and looked downwards, staring at her sandals. Terry 
chuckled at that, letting go of her shoulders. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. Relax. 
I&#39;m not hitting on you. It&#39;s Chizuru you love... right?&quot;

&quot;...Y-you... know about that...?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s all over you,&quot; Said Terry, &quot;...have you told her yet?&quot;

Yumi shook her head. &quot;...No... I&#39;m afraid... of what her reaction might 
be. I&#39;ve already asked a lot of her... and she&#39;s been so kind to me 
about... what happened... in Meta Tokyo...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t make my mistakes, Yumi.&quot; Terry told her, &quot;if you have something 
you wanna say to someone then tell them before its too late. &#39;Cause you 
never know when something&#39;s gonna happen to prevent you from doing so.&quot;

&quot;...I suppose you&#39;re right. But still... it&#39;s never easy for people like 
us... to share our feelings, is it?&quot;

Terry didn&#39;t answer. At that point he was staring hard into the night 
sky. Yumi expected some response so looked over at him when she didn&#39;t 
get one. And she saw that serious expression on his face. He was looking 
at something. Yumi cast her gaze in the same direction as Terry. Off in 
the distance, there were lights in the sky. A few of them were... 
growing in size. Then Yumi gasped when she realized that that light 
wasn&#39;t growing... but rather moving. 

Terry growled and dove for Yumi. &quot;Get down!&quot;

The two teens fell to the ground. And that light rushing their way came 
straight at EDEN. It smashed into the iron frame of the upper level, 
causing a huge explosion that swallowed up a small section of the deck. 
Right next to the landing planes and cargo carriers. The combustion 
rocked the immediate area and caused debris to be spewed from the 
explosion point onwards. Including over the balconies. Terry shielded 
Yumi from the blasted scraps of wood and metal with his back. He grunted 
at the pain, but bore the weight of it. Flames rose up above. And smoke 
spread from that point. EDEN had been attacked by a beam cannon. Looking 
out into the sky, Terry could see hundreds of blue lights. Which he knew 
to be the exhaust energy of Meta Suits. The blonde man rolled off of 
Yumi once the debris stopped falling, and the girl stood up, looking 
confused as ever before. &quot;What... is happening...?&quot;

&quot;...Ah! Why, those bastards!&quot; Terry growled loudly, &quot;It&#39;s Protocol! 
They&#39;ve found EDEN somehow!&quot;

Yumi stared quietly at the Meta Suit army that was coming their way. 
&quot;...Protocol? But how... did they get here...?&quot;

&quot;Yumi!&quot; Terry quickly rushed to the doorway, but looked back to address 
her, &quot;Hurry! Find one of the attendants and have them lead you to one of 
the shelters! I&#39;ve gotta get to my Meta Suit!&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Shinrai Building.

As Commander Celaph sat on the chair of his desk, he once again found 
himself looking up towards the ceiling at the screen coming out of it. 
And at the images on that screen. Those of the three hooded men known 
only as the Triad of the Inquisition. Once again they were enshrouded in 
darkness. And once again they were speaking to the current commander of 
all Protocol&#39;s military power in Japan. 

Celaph clasped his gloved hands together. &quot;...It is as you say. The 
Thanatos has been awakened from his slumber and is now being shipped to 
Ix Nos Babel. I find that his temperament has changed slightly. Perhaps 
cryogenic suspension was actually beneficial for him in the long run.&quot;

&quot;That may be so,&quot; One of the three said, &quot;but there is still the matter 
of his other half. The Eros. Our attempt to catch her was fruitless. And 
as we all know... she escaped Meta Tokyo with the Oriax. This is no 
longer within the jurisdiction of our abilities. You will have to find 
her.&quot;

Celaph smiled. &quot;She has already been found.&quot;

All three men looked on, until the second said, &quot;...You have located the 
Eros, Celaph?&quot;  

&quot;Yes,&quot; He confirmed, &quot;she has been monitored for sometime now by one of 
my informants. Not only has she successfully broken the biological 
restraints on her powers with mere thought... it appears that she has 
taken herself in with Chrysalis.&quot;

&quot;Chrysalis?&quot; One of the Triad members replied, &quot;So she met with a rebel 
in the outside world, eh? Interesting. What more have you learned from 
this... informant?&quot;

&quot;The location of EDEN...&quot;

The first Triad member spoke. &quot;You have found EDEN?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; The commander separated his hands, &quot;it is six miles off the 
Japanese eastern coast. Shrouded by barrier fields strong enough to 
cloak it from our scanners for all this time. So I sent Naam and fifty 
soldiers of the Divine Blade to secure its destruction.&quot;

&quot;You deployed the Divine Blade?&quot; Said the second hooded man. 

&quot;I apologize for taking military action without consulting you or at 
least the Upper Council. But I didn&#39;t want to waste time. Eros is with 
them. And the anniversary of her eighteenth year is closing in. I had to 
assure that she was secured before then. I am willing to accept the 
penalties for my insubordination, sirs.&quot;

&quot;...We shall ignore that in this case, Commander Celaph,&quot; Claimed the 
first of the three, &quot;your actions were the correct ones, regardless of 
the haste. However it seems risky to trigger a battle in an isolated 
place like EDEN. If the Eros is killed... then it was all for naught.&quot;

&quot;Do not be worried, sirs...&quot; He replied, &quot;...she is far too strong.&quot;

The second of the three then said, &quot;Very well. We shall entrust this 
mission fully to your hands. However. There will be a slight change of 
plans. The Reunion will take place at Ix Nos Babel.&quot;

&quot;Ix Nos Babel?&quot; Celaph mimicked absently. 

&quot;That is right. The Japanese branch has drawn too much attention to 
itself with the release of the Oriax Meta Suit. Cold winter shall be the 
embrace this time around. Make the necessary preparations once the 
operation against EDEN is complete.&quot;

Celaph bowed his head to them in acceptance of that. &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The regular forces of EDEN&#39;s defence were known as the Protectors of the 
Ark. A symbolic name for their sworn fealty to the Ark of the Luria. And 
their control room, their station of command for both the Meta Suit 
troops and the foot soldiers, was a Seminal Control Tower of the central 
eastern district. Below the steel roof of the upper level was the steel 
roof of the control tower, protected from attacks by that level. 
Normally the operatives inside the tower were only there to do sweeping 
checks of the vicinity around EDEN every few hours. Not to command the 
city&#39;s troops in the event of an attack. EDEN had never been attacked 
once in its forty-three year history. But now the Divine Blade squad of 
the Holy Protocol Army had made history. 

They had attacked EDEN. 

Now people were scrambling to and around the Seminal Control Tower for 
guidance on how to act. Fifteen men and women from the upper levels had 
come down to man the highly modernized computer terminals of that 
central Control Room. And the leader of EDEN&#39;s military forces (in terms 
of defence) had come, too. He was Colonel Vice Whitfield. The 
fifty-something army leader crossed his arms and began giving orders to 
all the helms people at hand. For them to relay his orders to counteract 
this threat. The whole of EDEN was on red alert. In every hallway, 
corridor, dorm, hall, chamber, hanger, shop and storage room, the alert 
siren was going off. A repeated mantra of danger, joined by flashing red 
lights. Over the intercom, all able-bodied men and women were ordered to 
make their way from the city area to the shelters while the regular 
forces and the Meta Suit forces scrambled to deal with the attack. 

At the back of the control room, the automatic door opened up. Beatrix 
and Sophia ran into the room in urgency, moving over to Colonel 
Whitfield in the centre of the command post.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Beatrix asked, &quot;what is happening?&quot;

Whitfield crossed his arms. &quot;We are under attack. At least fifty Meta 
Suits from the Divine Blade forces have attacked EDEN. They&#39;ve already 
destroyed at least 20% of the upper level. Now our own troops have to be 
deployed.&quot;

&quot;Above the city!?&quot; Sophia said seriously, &quot;but have you evacuated all 
the citizens up there?&quot;

&quot;There was not enough time.&quot; Replied Whitfield.

Sophia scowled. &quot;What do you mean by that?! If those people get caught 
in the crossfire then they are sure to be killed!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re overstepping rank, Major!&quot; Whitfield shouted, &quot;this is a war 
we&#39;re fighting, not a game! We have informed everyone to flee to a 
shelter! If anyone remains then it&#39;s their own fault for not heeding our 
words! We have no time this now! Or would you rather see EDEN 
destroyed?!&quot;

After hearing that outburst from Colonel Whitfield, Sophia said no more. 
While Beatrix tried to calm the situation down with another issue, &quot;what 
of my grandfather?&quot;

&quot;Father Bartholomeus is safe.&quot; Claimed Whitfield.

Beatrix thanked God for that. But she couldn&#39;t help but be concerned 
with the fate of the upper level. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

High above the artificially lighted Control Tower was the surface of 
EDEN. The beautiful night stars were now drowned out in brightness by 
the flash of explosions and fire. Fire that burned across the entire 
east side of the structure, and now spreading into the over-ground parts 
of the city. Young and old alike screamed and ran for cover as the Meta 
Suits zoomed high up above in combat. The Divine Blade soldiers rained 
down heavy gunfire from their two-handed Beam Rifles. Viscous explosion 
after vicious explosion rocked that level to the cast of the metal. 
People were thrown off their feet from the strength of the vibrations 
that emanated from those compressed bursts of combustion. Smoke seeped 
through the houses and shops of the citizens of EDEN. As the townsfolk 
tried to run they coughed and wheezed on that smoke. Constantly passing 
by the mangled corpses of the current dead as they did. The attack was 
fast and furious. In a short time the Divine Blade had done much damage. 

The floor hanger doors on the eastern side then opened up. Out from it 
flew the Bishamon. Alongside it were the dozens of Meta Suits deployed 
in the defence of the city. The brown-coloured Uvalls and Gusions of 
Chrysalis, as well as the green-coloured Halphas-type ones that had been 
created specifically to defend EDEN. Altogether there was a number of 
seventy Meta Suits that had come out of the hanger for the battle. The 
Bishamon was at the head of that army. And they all flew in the 
direction of the attacking Amon Meta Suits from Protocol&#39;s army. While 
he did, Terry looked down from the video screen in his cockpit. At least 
half of the eastern section of the upper city section was in flames. The 
Protocol scum had only attacked around fifteen minutes ago and yet they 
had obliterated that which had taken years to build.

&quot;Damn those bastards to hell!&quot; Terry seethed, &quot;Are you with me, guys?! 
Lets go kick some ass!&quot;

The Uvalls, Gusions and Halphas&#39; pilots all yelled their agreement and 
zoomed into the thicket of the Divine Blade&#39;s assault. The 
purple-coloured and heavily armoured Amons soon caught onto the 
mobilization of EDEN&#39;s military and started firing from their beam 
cannons. EDEN&#39;s forces exchanged that gunfire with their own. Soon the 
sight of blue and purple gun energy was shooting through the skies like 
a pyrotechnic show. The lights and sounds of the battle could be heard 
from miles off. And new explosions took place. Those of destroyed Meta 
Suits on both sides. The battle was on. The Bishamon flew through the 
engaged air above the city. One of the Amons came flying in from the 
front. It pulled up its long beam rifle then fired for Terry&#39;s mecha. 
The Bishamon pumped up its thrusters and blazed to one side of the 
gunfire. Then the plates of Japanese shoulder armour mounted on its 
shoulders reacted. They rose up slightly. And out came the twin turrets 
of the Bishamon&#39;s Gatling capabilities. Dozens of bullets were offloaded 
in rapid fire bursts from the Bishamon&#39;s shoulder cannons. And the 
attacking Amon was trapped in that hail of firepower. Right until it 
exploded into purple-painted shards of metal and ash. The gatling guns, 
one on either shoulder of the Bishamon, returned to their compartments 
underneath the armour. Which was when Terry noticed one coming at him 
from the left. The Bishamon swung around in reflex and reached behind 
its back with one of its large metallic hands. Then pulled out that 
enormous Japanese-flavour sword. The thermal energy Katana. The Bishamon 
unsheathed the weapon and charged it with searing hot energy extending 
from the Qi-Generator of the mech. It then rushed forwards on the power 
of its thrusters and slashed. Cutting that Amon and its pilot into two 
even halves, with a long streak of jade fire trailing behind it. The 
remains of the Amon exploded into nothingness. The Bishamon flew back 
around and started hacking a path through all the mecha in its way. 
Terry yelled fierce war cries from the crux of his throat with each 
strike. Until he saw one particular mecha that caught his interest. 

Terry froze in the cockpit, while the Bishamon recoiled from the 
destruction of another Amon. He stared through the video screen at a 
certain mecha in the battle that was definitely an enemy, but looked 
different from the Amon-types. It was of a dusky-red, similar in colour 
to his own Meta Suit. But that one had a design like a Teutonic knight. 
The thick plates of Prussian/Germanic armour in polished red, with that 
big golden lion symbol on its chest, screamed a certain familiarity to 
Terry. But he couldn&#39;t quite place it.

&quot;That suit...&quot; He said, &quot;...where have I seen that suit...?&quot;

Then it all came flashing back. His memories of the past were clear and 
concise. When he looked back at the flames of his village, deep in his 
memory, Terry could see that same Meta Suit. 

That very same one...

&quot;...That&#39;s the one...&quot; He said, anger rising in every syllable, &quot;that&#39;s 
the one... that killed my father! That&#39;s the one that destroyed my 
village! Bastaaaaaaaaaaard!&quot;

The Bishamon turned on its thrusters once more and darted through the 
crowds of battling mecha, through the explosion and gunfire, all the way 
to the presence of that red mecha. While rushing towards it, the twin 
gatlings under the Bishamon&#39;s shoulder armour came out from their short 
slumber and fired. The red mecha, armed with both a mecha-sized 
broadsword and mecha-sized wrist shield, caught onto this. The mecha 
swung around and pushed forward its circular shield to deflect all the 
rapid fire bullets. The Bishamon ceased this attack when Terry realized 
it was getting him no where. The gatlings slid back into the shoulder 
plates. And the two mechas were left facing each other in the middle of 
that loud, echoing battleground in the sky.

Terry yelled out through a com-link so his voice could be heard by the 
other pilot. &quot;...You! Who are you?! Were you at the village of Eberbach 
eleven years ago!?&quot;

The pilot of the red suit laughed through the speakers of his own 
com-link. &quot;Hah, hah, hah! Eberbach! That takes me back. But who would 
ask such a question of the great General Naam in the middle of a 
battle?&quot;

Terry took note of the name and the familiarity of the voice but soon 
answered with, &quot;It was you.... You were one of the ones who ruined my 
village... damn you...&quot;

&quot;A citizen of Eberbach...?&quot; Naam wondered, &quot;...who are you?&quot;

The pilot of the Bishamon snarled. &quot;...Remember it well. Because it&#39;s 
the name of your executioner... I am Terry Hennig!&quot;

General Naam fell silent for a moment. Right before, &quot;...Terry...? 
Hennig...? So then... you must... be the son of Heinrich and... Lilith. 
So you actually survived the contest... now that is something I never 
would have predicted.&quot;

&quot;...Heinrich and Lilith... that&#39;s my mom and dad. How do you know who 
they are!? Why did you kill them?!&quot;

Naam swung the broadsword of his Meta Suit to one side in an attempt to 
provoke Terry. &quot;...Fool. I&#39;ll not make the same mistake twice. What does 
the past mean to soldiers in the thick of battle? Come at me in that 
Samurai Meta Suit of yours! And see if you can best my Bahamut in a 
fight! Do you want revenge?!&quot;

&quot;Orraaaagggghhh!&quot; Terry left nothing to mere words after that. The 
Bishamon flew forwards at blinding speeds at the Bahamut. The two 
thermal-capable weapons clashed against each other with a warped ripple 
that passed through the air in waves. The two Meta Suits locked swords, 
and their heads leaned into one and other. The force of their clash 
pushed them both back. Bishamon regained its sense of stability first 
and opened the shoulder plates once more. A hail of bullets came flying 
from the turrets of his gatlings once again. The Bahamut swung up its 
shield and blocked them once again. But this time it advanced into a 
charge whilst guarding against the bullet shower. The Bahamut&#39;s shield 
rammed into the chestplate of the Bishamon. Terry and his mecha jerked 
back violently from that. Then Naam followed up his attack, swinging the 
broadsword into the air. The Bishamon replied. The two swords clashed 
once more with a loud, throbbing bang. And they held each other off in 
this fresh weapon lock. The Bishamon strained to hold off the heavier 
blade with its own. Which was when Terry looked at his control panel. 
His sensors were reading General Naam&#39;s Qi level at 6,450. And Terry, in 
his current state of mind, was bearing up at only 5,200. Naam seemed to 
notice this too, because Terry could here his laugher through the 
speakers of his Meta Suit&#39;s mouthpiece. The katana was now losing ground 
to the broadsword, coming close to the head of the Bishamon. Naam was 
overpowering him. And Terry couldn&#39;t focus. His mind was to caught up 
with his parents. 

&quot;...Dammit...&quot; He seethed in the cockpit, &quot;...tell me... who are you, 
Naam? What&#39;s your connection to my parents!? What do you know that I 
don&#39;t?&quot;

Naam sniggered. &quot;Stupid boy... just like your father... the reasons why 
don&#39;t matter at all. All that matters is the result. And the result for 
me is victory...&quot;

The Bahamut extended its long mechanical leg and kicked the Bishamon 
straight in the stomach area. Which happened to be where the cockpit was 
positioned. The samurai-like Meta Suit was knocked out of the sword lock 
and thrown out of the air. It went careening into a layout of houses in 
the city. The suit smashed into those homes without anything else to 
cushion it. Crushing to death the families left trapped inside them. 
Rubble clattered over the legs and chest of the Bishamon, while blood 
ran down from Terry&#39;s forehead. The forceful kicks of the Bahamut were 
something to be feared. 

&quot;...Damn you...&quot; Terry seethed to himself weakly, right before he lost 
consciousness, encircled by the sound of explosions and gunfire.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Across the tract of EDEN, a separate team of Amon mechas attacked the 
western side of the citadel. The residential area. That team was of four 
particular Amons. Each one belonging to a particular pilot of high 
Divine Blade rank. Those pilots were Kraepelin, Steed, Aria and Ry. 
Their Amons were armed with either beam rifles or energy-charged 
broadswords linked up to their generators via a thick cable. And each of 
them had given a particular name to their Amons. 

Kraepelin regarded his as &#39;Azazel&#39;. Steed called his &#39;Bifrons&#39;. Aria had 
named her Meta Suit &#39;Crocell&#39;. Finally Ry called his suit by the name 
&#39;Decarabia&#39;. The four of them hovered over the western side of the town 
without any EDEN mecha around. They were too caught up with the battle 
taking place just a quarter of a mile away. The sound of it was vibrant 
enough to be heard from that distance. But it was having no bearing on 
what these four did. Those with beam cannons (Bifrons and Crocell) fired 
ruthlessly upon the unguarded homes of those living there. Fire swept 
through that part of the city wildly. Smoke rose up into the air while 
the screams of those torched to death from the fire joined it. 

Kraepelin laughed from the cockpit of Azazel while his two friends went 
about blowing up innocent citizens. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. Those two are so 
zealous. They&#39;re worse than me!&quot;

&quot;General Naam should be pleased,&quot; Ry said from the safety of his 
Decarabia, &quot;the ring leaders of these fragile people should come out at 
some point. If we have our way... this whole thing will go down into sea 
as a distant memory.&quot;

While they spoke, Crocell had its long-snout gun aimed at another group 
of houses. It was about to pull the trigger but halted when a family (a 
man, a woman and two kids) ran out of the house and onto the &#39;street&#39;, 
for dear life. Aria&#39;s smile widened and she focused the crosshairs of 
her rifle at the four of them, yelling, &quot;Some survivors, eh? Anyone who 
denies the will of Protocol must die! Even children! So say goodbye, you 
little bitches!&quot;

A second female voice yelled out through the speakers of a Meta Suit 
just before Crocell pulled the trigger of the beam rifle. &quot;Stop it!&quot;

Aria looked to her right from the cockpit of the Crocell. From her side 
cameras she could she a Meta Suit rushing towards her with a long, 
beaming energy blade extended from its titanium left hand. But that was 
the last thing she would ever see. Bifrons, Decarabia and Azazel became 
alert. The energy blade of that Meta Suit slashed straight through the 
metal torso of the Crocell. That mecha burst backwards from the hacked 
machine. And the Crocell exploded violently in the air, killing Aria 
instantly. While the family that she had aimed at continued to escape. 
Bifrons, Decarabia and Azazel readied their weapons and stared down at 
this mecha. But they knew it well. Or at least from what General Naam 
had told them.

It was the Oriax.

And its pilot, Yumi Mishima, was sitting on the elongated leather seat 
of its watery trans-dimensional cockpit with her hands at the controls. 

Steed growled angrily from his cockpit. &quot;Damn you! Killing Aria was a 
mistake you won&#39;t live to regret!&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s the one...&quot; Ry commented. 

&quot;The Oriax...&quot; Kraepelin grinned, &quot;...this should be fun...&quot;

Yumi yelled at them from the Oriax&#39;s mouthpiece. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to 
fight! I didn&#39;t want to kill again! But you attacked a peaceful haven 
for serene people! I can&#39;t ignore that! Even if it causes me pain, I 
cannot let you kill innocent people!&quot;

Steed snarled at her, while the Bifrons leapt into a charging action 
towards the Oriax. &quot;Little girl! If you can&#39;t handle the battlefield 
then stay... away!&quot;

The Oriax watched the actions of the attacking Bifrons. It fired a hard 
shot from its beam cannon. The Oriax vaulted upwards with its thrusters 
as well as its Zero Gravity Movement. Then it protruded its right hand. 
The palm opened and a Vulcan turret shifted out. The Oriax fired rapidly 
into the steel torso of the Bifrons. Hundreds of bullets were buried 
into its armour by the time it was done. Steed yelled a death cry when 
the whole thing exploded, joining Aria in the great beyond. Decarabia 
rushed forwards without a word coming from Ry and tried to slash the 
Oriax with its energy sword. Yumi powered up the Oriax&#39;s Gauntlet Blade 
once again and slashed back. The Oriax&#39;s energy blade burned straight 
through the sword of the Decarabia and then down into its armour. It 
swiftly dragged the Gauntlet Blade out of the Amon-type Meta Suit 
moments before it blew up. The oil from the remains of the machine 
splattered over the chest and head of the Oriax. But that left only the 
Azazel. 

Kraepelin shivered in his cockpit. &quot;...H-how can a Meta Suit be that 
strong...? According to Azazel&#39;s readings... that suit is running on a 
Qi level of over 9, 500!&quot;

The Oriax lifted its blazing energy wrist blade and pointed it at the 
Azazel, while Yumi said to the pilot, &quot;This does not have to continue 
any longer! Please just leave!&quot;

Kraepelin sneered however. &quot;...Wrong! I won&#39;t leave. This is just a 
setback. You&#39;re nothing but a kid! And I know exactly who you are! The 
one that General Naam told us to capture... the pilot of the Oriax... 
Yumi Mishima! Now it&#39;s all coming to a head...&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s simple,&quot; Kraepelin jabbed, &quot;...you&#39;re too soft to be a soldier. I 
can hear it in your voice. You&#39;re completely unprepared for battle. And 
it will be your downfall!&quot;

Yumi watched from the Oriax as Azazel opened a compartment in its 
metallic wrist. A gatling gun of its own came up slowly from it. Then it 
pointed directly towards the ground they were hovering over. &quot;My sensors 
tell me that there are at least fifteen living people inside the three 
houses that are below me. I can offload at least 200 bullets in the five 
seconds it would take for you to fly over here and chop my Meta Suit in 
half. That&#39;s more than enough firepower to kill every single one of 
them! Even the little baby bawling in its cot! Unless you surrender and 
hand over the Oriax, I&#39;ll kill them all!&quot;

&quot;W-what!?&quot;

Kraepelin grinned evilly. &quot;...You have two choices. You can either 
attack and watch me murder those pathetic bystanders just an instant 
before I die... or you can submit and I&#39;ll let them live.&quot;

&quot;Y-you&#39;re bluffing!&quot; Yumi argued, &quot;You&#39;d kill them anyway!&quot;

&quot;Maybe I am bluffing. Maybe I&#39;m not. But the real question is... are you 
prepared to risk their lives to find out...?&quot;

A bead of sweat dripped down Yumi&#39;s face. Her eyes shook. Even now she 
could see flashes of that little girl version of herself covered in 
blood. And the voice of Terry in her mind... &#39;I&#39;d give anything to 
assure that no other little boy would have to make that choice&#39;. In that 
way... it was obvious that she had no choice but to surrender. Even if 
this man was bluffing (and there didn&#39;t really seem to be a reason as to 
why we would) she couldn&#39;t risk someone being killed if there was 
something she could do about it. Yumi sighed in defeat, lowering her 
head. &quot;...You win...&quot;

Kraepelin sniggered. &quot;...Good. I knew you&#39;d see sense. Now get out of 
the cockpit.&quot;

The Oriax slowly descended to ground level. It landed on a street of the 
city, and the door forged into the stomach of the machine (the one that 
led into the miniature cockpit-dimension) opened. Yumi stepped out of 
the door to its innards and jumped down to the blazing fires of the 
streets below. She looked up at the now lofty Azazel, which kept its 
gatling gauntlet pointed at the houses Kraepelin had threatened to gun 
down. The Azazel landed loudly. Its own cockpit door opened. And 
Kraepelin stepped out with a gun in his uniformed hand. He jumped out 
off the Meta Suit as Yumi had done and landed to the ground. Then walked 
forwards with the gun pointed at the young woman. While he walked he 
stuffed his hand into his pocket. Then pulled out a pair of handcuffs. 
He tossed them to the feet of Yumi.

&quot;Put those on.&quot; He ordered. 

Yumi sighed and kneeled down. Taking the cuffs into her hands she 
attached them to her wrists awkwardly. Kraepelin chuckled with victory. 
Then stepped forwards, coming face to face with the securely restrained 
girl. He then grit his teeth at her and smacked her violently over the 
face with the butt of his gun. Yumi cried out and dropped to the ground, 
bleeding from the mouth. 

Kraepelin then sheathed his gun in its pocket holster. &quot;That&#39;s for Aria, 
Steed and Ry. Know this. Anyone who defies Protocol earns themselves a 
one-way ticket to hell.&quot;

Yumi coughed from the smoke and heat, spurting up blood which splattered 
over the metal floor. &quot;...T-tell me... h-how... did you... find this... 
place...?&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Kraepelin looked over to the right, &quot;...to regard it in terms of 
a criminal offence... I&#39;d have to call it an act of espionage. She&#39;s 
supplied us with more information on EDEN and its military capabilities 
than you can imagine...&quot;

Yumi rolled over onto her stomach to she could look to the right, as 
Kraepelin had done. Though she had not noticed it before, there was a 
small fighter plane nestled between two artificial gardens on the other 
side of the road. It had been newly landed. And a woman stood astride 
it. Bearing long black hair and dressed in a Protocol military uniform 
of dark green. A woman. Yumi couldn&#39;t see her very well at first because 
of the smoke and the shadows of the fire that was cast upon her. It 
wasn&#39;t until the woman, that informant for Protocol, stepped forward 
that Yumi saw her face. The hacker&#39;s eyes enlarged and her heart skipped 
a beat. The Protocolian spy was...

&quot;...C-Chizuru...?!&quot;

The dark-haired woman, now with a very serious expression on her 
frighteningly dazzling face, stopped walking. &quot;That&#39;s not my name. I am 
Lieutenant First Class -- Chizu Yagata. Operative of the Special 
Reconnaissance &amp; Tactical Intelligence Division of the Holy Protocol 
Army. And you, Miss Mishima, you once again belong to Protocol.&quot;
