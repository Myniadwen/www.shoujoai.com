<h1>Once Upon A Time, That Summer</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>You&#39;ve all heard this story before. Girl lives in a small town with her crazy family, acts 
like she&#39;s totally embarrassed by them but secretly isn&#39;t, then goes on some kind of wacky 
adventure one summer that changes everything. Well, that&#39;s me in a nutshell up until the 
acting totally embarrassed part.
 
My name is Jaye Weed, and I&#39;m proud of my crazy family. I mean, when your mom&#39;s the only 
one on the block who&#39;s logged over one hundred hours on Donkey Kong at the gas station 
arcade it&#39;s hard not to think she&#39;s the coolest mom in the world. My dad&#39;s a lit geek and I 
don&#39;t get half the stuff he reads, but it&#39;s kinda fun to try. And my brother&#39;s a flaky, 
fruity artist who&#39;s got talent instead of just plain angst like other flaky fruity artists.
 
As for me? I had my wacky adventure the summer of my fifteenth year, but my family wasn&#39;t 
in it. Instead, I learned something about myself I never would have without my best friend.
 
Misty Clark is my other half. We&#39;ve known each other since the first grade when we got into 
a fight over the last yellow crayon in art class, and after the teacher made us shake hands 
and make up, we were instant best friends. We practically share a brain, but there always 
seemed to be another side to her, a side she kept hidden until that summer.
 
It was an ordinary day and we were sitting in the woods behind her house, drinking root 
beer from the Stewart&#39;s down the road and talking about life. But when the conversation 
drifted to guys, she suddenly got...weird. Kinda fidgety.
 
&quot;Jaye...? You and I, we&#39;ve known each other a long time, right?&quot; she ventured.
 
&quot;Well, yeah! Remember the yellow crayon?&quot; I laughed, then stopped when I realized she 
wasn&#39;t laughing with me. &quot;Why? What&#39;s going on?&quot;
 
&quot;Well, I...&quot; She bit her lip and turned away. &quot;It&#39;s not important, you&#39;d just be upset if I 
told you.&quot;
 
&quot;Misty?&quot; Why would I be mad? Okay, so one time we fought over a guy in the seventh grade, 
but that only lasted a week. Unless... &quot;You and Tom, before you broke up with him, did 
you-&quot;
 
&quot;No, of course not!&quot; she cried. &quot;I would&#39;ve told you if we had.&quot;
 
&quot;Then what&#39;s this all about?&quot; I asked, but she put down her soda and hugged her knees to 
her chest...something she always did before she was about to cry. Instinctively I put my 
arm around her. &quot;Misty?&quot;
 
&quot;Look, Jaye, what if...&quot; She took a deep breath and swallowed. &quot;What if I told you 
I...didn&#39;t really like guys that much? At all, even?&quot;
 
&quot;What are you-&quot; I didn&#39;t even have to finish the question before it hit me. &quot;Oh. You mean, 
you&#39;re...&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.&quot; She slowly turned to look at me. &quot;Ever since eighth grade, actually. I thought it&#39;d 
go away if I kept dating guys, but...&quot;
 
&quot;Why would I be mad about that?&quot; I asked. &quot;So you&#39;re gay, big deal! You&#39;re still the same 
Misty I&#39;ve known since first grade!&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s not all,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;Jaye, I...it&#39;s not even just liking girls, it&#39;s liking one 
girl.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh?&quot; I brush her hair away from her face. &quot;Who is it?&quot;
 
That&#39;s when she kissed me. I know this is gonna sound trite and cliche, but that kiss 
honestly and seriously awakened things in me I&#39;d always only suspected were there. I liked 
guys, sure, but I remember crushing on some older girls too...I guess I thought it was just 
a passing thing, but here I was.
 
And feeling these things for Misty made sense the more I thought about it. When we pulled 
back and looked into each other&#39;s eyes, I knew then and there my life would never be the 
same again.
 
My name is Jaye Weed, and that summer I fell in love with my best friend.
