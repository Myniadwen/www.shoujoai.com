<a href="../original/chasers-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>        &quot;Now this,&quot; Kate sighed, &quot;is a good cup of coffee.&quot; The brow 
haired officer was clearly enjoying her cup, savoring it like a true 
coffee hound.

        &quot;I missed this,&quot; Jen agreed as she took a sip of her own cup. 
The cozy little cafe bustled around them, waitresses going back and 
forth, tables with men and women all around them. The blonde looked over 
at Kate thoughtfully, wondering if she should ask her something.

        &quot;What?&quot; Kate raised an eyebrow.

        &quot;I&#39;ve heard about you on the departmental grapevine,&quot; Jen 
blushed, &quot;but I&#39;ve never really asked you about it... are you a 
lesbian?&quot;

        Kate hesitated, then said &quot;Yes, I am.&quot; She smiled over at Jen 
wryly, &quot;A non-practicing one at the moment, though.&quot;

        Jen really wanted to ask her why, but something in Kate&#39;s eyes 
told her not to ask anything more. There was grief there in those eyes, 
loss and a deep pain. Kate had lost someone very close to her, that was 
crystal clear.

        &#39;I wonder,&#39; Jen thought as she drank a bit more of her coffee, 
&#39;if it was that Lynn I keep hearing about?&#39; She finished off her cup, 
noticing that Kate&#39;s was done as well and said, &quot;Guess we should get 
back, huh?&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s no rest for the wicked,&quot; Kate agreed as the two of them 
got up. Jen headed out first, Kate lingering to grab her jacket.

        &quot;You two make a cute couple,&quot; the waitress said with a smile.

        Kate looked at her in surprise, &quot;We&#39;re not a couple!&quot;

        The waitress raised her eyebrow and smirked, &quot;Not yet, maybe.&quot;

        Kate was left rather speechless as the busty waitress sauntered 
off, her hips swaying, to go serve some of the other customers. With a 
sheepish shake of her head Kate went off outside, only to meet Jen&#39;s 
quite concerned gaze.

        &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jen asked.

        Kate smiled slightly, &quot;It seems we acted just a bit too well in 
there.&quot; With that she recapped her little conversation with the waitress 
inside.

        Jen blushed, &quot;Sorry.&quot; They walked towads her car, &quot;I don&#39;t think 
you&#39;d have been that big of a hit without that kiss you gave me.&quot;

        Kate climbed into the passenger&#39;s seat and pointedly asked, &quot;Do 
you think that your old flame would have bought it without the kiss?&quot;

        &quot;Probably not,&quot; Jen had to agree. They drove back to the station 
house smoothly, the conversation kept down to a minimum. Jen popped open 
the passenger door for Kate and grinned, &quot;Thanks for helping me out.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Kate said with a smile.

        &quot;Do you think I could take you out,&quot; Jen said to her a bit 
tentatively, &quot;for dinner, maybe, to pay you back for all this?&quot;

        Kate sighed softly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Jen.&quot; With a grim smile, &quot;I 
don&#39;t date other cops.&quot; She firmly shut the door and strode off 
silently.

        Jen watched her go in surprise, stunned by the sudden cold 
shoulder. &quot;Shit,&quot; she swore softly, then pulled back out into traffic.

        &quot;Kate hesitated at the door, watching Jen drive away. &#39;Not 
again,&#39; she thought to herself sadly, &#39;I don&#39;t think I could stand it 
happening to me again.&#39; Trying to banish any feelings of guilt she might 
be feeling, Kate walked inside.

        The halls were pretty quiet as Kate made her way to the command 
center, nodding to Beth who was working away on one of the computers, 
playing a game on another, and reading statistics off a third all at the 
same time.

        &quot;I&#39;ll clock you back in,&quot; Beth smirked.

        &quot;What?&quot; Kate frowned.

        Beth reached up to touch her lips pointedly as the redhead said, 
&quot;That deep shade of red really doesn&#39;t suit you very well.&quot;

        Kate went beet red as she realized some of Jen&#39;s lipstick had 
come off on her own lips. She scrubbed her lips with a napkin while Beth 
sat there smirking. &quot;Not a word,&quot; Kate growled, &quot;to anyone about this, 
got it?&quot;

        &quot;Must have been an interesting break,&quot; Beth smiled.

        &quot;Nothing happened,&quot; Kate scowled, &quot;I was just helping out Jen.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Beth nodded thoughtfully, &quot;she nealy drowned, despite us 
being on dry land, and you had to give her mouth to mouth to save her! 
That&#39;s it.&quot;

        Kate opened her mouth to say something, then closed it. There 
wasn&#39;t much she could say about it, and she&#39;d probably just be digging 
herself even deeper. &quot;Never mind,&quot; she sighed and walked back to her 
office. Cubicle, really, but they called it an office.

        In another part of the building Gwen nodded to the image of her 
superior officer on the view screen. &quot;Yes sir,&quot; the stylis Asian woman 
made a note, &quot;the meeting&#39;s tomorrow at thirteen hundred hours. May I 
ask what will be discussed at this meeting?&quot;

        &quot;Several proposals regarding the android situation are going to 
be discussed before we pass them on to the Mayor,&quot; the grey haired man 
said smoothly, &quot;and your imput is needed.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen nodded, knowing that he&#39;d told her almost 
nothing, likely intentionally. Her boss cut the connection first, 
leaving Gwen alone with her thoughts. &#39;They&#39;re looking into moving on 
the free-will issue,&#39; Gwen thought to herself bleakly.

        Gwen looked around her small office, the walls hanging with 
awards and citations. There were a few photos of awards ceremonies, a 
photo with the Mayor and Chief of Police, and a couple of others, but 
nothing personal there, none of family or friends. She got up out of her 
desks, taking down the one of her, the Chief and the Mayor, her 
expression unreadable, then she put it back up.

        Flopping down in her leather chair Gwen put her hands behind her 
head. Softly she sighed, &quot;So what do I do now?&quot; She reached over to key 
in a comunicator sequence, and smiled as it was almost immediately 
answered.

        &quot;Alexis Jameson&#39;s office,&quot; the dark haired, European doctor 
turned to look at the screen and smiled happily on seeing her, &quot;Oh, 
Gwen! What can I do for you?&quot;

        Looking quite serious Gwen said, &quot;Do you think we could have 
dinner tomorrow?&quot;

        Alexis knew how to read her ex-lover very well, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

        &quot;I can&#39;t talk about it here,&quot; Gwen said regretfully, &quot;could we 
meet after work tomorrow?&quot;

        &quot;Tomorrow then,&quot; Alexis nodded, giving Gwen a worried glance.
