Ten minutes. That&#39;s how long she had&#151;well, perhaps longer, if the first 
two fights started to drag. Merry&#39;s personal record for showering had 
been eight lean minutes, so she wondered if she could beat or at least 
meet it as she headed off to the locker room, undressed, and felt the 
layer of sweat melt off underneath the cool water. Ahh. She soon found 
company as another would-be contender came inside, undressed (in full 
view of Weathers, who couldn&#39;t help but stare), and took the stall right 
next to her. It was the blue-skinned beauty, G-Force, and she looked 
like she needed the wash even more.

&quot;Hey,&quot; said Merry, scrubbing her pink hair gently. G-Force greeted her 
with a nod. &quot;I&#39;m Rancor. I hear we&#39;re gonna be in the same match 
together pretty soon.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you and me. So not too much fraternizing or we&#39;ll end up liking 
each other too much to care.&quot; Merry chuckled, well, merrily, and turned 
her head a bit more to get a better look. G-Force had a good, feminine 
body, though not quite as tall or muscular as her own, and the long 
honey-colored hair of hers that stretched to the tips of her 
shoulderblades looked surprisingly wonderful matted against her watery 
flesh.

She quickly turned back when the smaller girl looked her way.

&quot;I wish they&#39;d give us more than ten minutes,&quot; she sighed, running her 
fingers through that blonde mane. &quot;On top of all this sweat and gunk, 
I&#39;m not feeling up to this. I&#39;m starting to wonder why I even got 
involved. I&#39;m with the Battle Divas&#151;you know them?&#151;and they all signed 
in together. I guess that means I&#39;m part of their team now, but I just 
don&#39;t feel worthy. I&#39;m barely able to control my powers, and I&#39;m kind of 
embarrassed to be beaten by that guy.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you mean the snob? Bah, he didn&#39;t beat you, he gave up.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but if he hadn&#39;t, I would&#39;ve lost.&quot;

&quot;Come on, he was cake. I&#39;ve seen kids tougher.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know. I just felt like I couldn&#39;t do it anymore. Even on my 
worst days I can force myself, but this... It made me feel like I 
couldn&#39;t even do anything. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m not much better now.&quot;

&quot;Ah, you&#39;ll do fine!&quot; insisted Rancor. &quot;You&#39;re fighting me next, so 
don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m not gonna go easy on you since it&#39;d be rude, and an 
insult, but I won&#39;t go all out either. Hey, let&#39;s be friends, huh? You 
seem like an all right girl, and blue is kinda my favorite color.&quot;

&quot;It is?&quot; She grinned, which Rancor felt utterly mesmerized by, and shied 
away. Oh, and the body lotion, she applied body lotion...! Merry had to 
force herself to look away.

&quot;My name&#39;s Merry,&quot; she said numbly. G-Force turned, then turned red, as 
she got quite a fair look at her companion&#39;s naked back...and backside.

&quot;Y-you sure you wanna tell me your real name?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, why, you some kinda criminal?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m one of the good guys. Erm, girls.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Merry had to force herself silent; otherwise, she would&#39;ve boldly 
sang, I like the good girls. &quot;No, I trust you. I don&#39;t really like my 
nickname, despite how fitting it is. I&#39;ve got a temper.&quot;

&quot;You seem nice enough.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but wait till&#39; I get going.&quot; G-Force kept her tongue for awhile, 
long enough for Merry to brave a revolution and peek. The walls of the 
shower only went so high...but at that angle, thankfully, there was 
nothing to seriously stare at&#151;except she had such beautiful shoulders...

She turned, smiled, extended her arm, and said, &quot;I&#39;m Sally.&quot;

&quot;Oh. That&#39;s a cute name.&quot;

&quot;Spare me, I hate it. My parents are such dorks.&quot;

&quot;No, really, it&#39;s cute. And hey, my name&#39;s Merry, so how domestic can ya 
get?&quot; G-Force nodded&#151;&quot;You have a point&quot;&#151;and despite being scheduled to 
pummel each other in a short time, a new friendship was made that very 
minute.

......

Lady Snowblood felt somebody&#39;s presence as she sat waiting for her name 
to be called. She knew it wasn&#39;t Rin, or even Kailin&#151;it was a strange 
soul, one that was difficult to define, like it was standing with one 
foot in the sea and the other on land. Or, it was only two half-souls 
sewn together... She looked in the general direction of the aura, 
relying on sound and smell to fill in for the gaps, and nodded.

&quot;Hello. May I help you?&quot; The aura fidgeted, wringing nervous hands. It 
tried to make sounds, but the only thing that came out were little 
grunts and squeaks. Snowblood removed her black glasses and reached her 
arm out. &quot;Forgive me if I&#39;ve upset you. I&#39;m blind.&quot;

I know, came a telepathic message. Snowblood was surprised for a second, 
but she took it in stride and nodded again. Her extrasensory perception, 
gifted to her in lieu of sight, enabled her to not only sense other 
people&#39;s presences, but their thoughts as well, thus enabling her to be 
incredibly skilled in battle&#151;for who could fight against somebody that 
already knew their strategy?

&quot;My name is...Snowblood.&quot; She hesitated only because she didn&#39;t know how 
much she could trust the person. They, it seemed, were content with 
that.

I am Skye. You know me from the first fight.

&quot;Oh yes, that&#39;s where I felt this presence. So, you are Skye. I&#39;ve heard 
that you can transform into a dragon.

Curse upon curse, and blessing upon blessing. What is my life?

&quot;...I&#39;m sorry?&quot;

...Excuse me, I think strange thoughts. I just came up to say 
hello...because I know you are disabled, like me.

&quot;You?&quot;

I&#39;m a mute. I lost my voice in exchange for these powers. Now you can 
see what good they did me.

&quot;No, you fought well. I was impressed.&quot;

...Thank you. Well, so long.

Snowblood tried following Skye&#39;s aura, but it soon became lost in the 
crowd of thousands: the noise, the smells, the unbearable rush of it 
all...

.........

&quot;Welcome, one and all, to the continuation of the Iron Arena Games! I am 
your host, William that Cat&#151;&quot;

&quot;And I am your co-host, Bonnie the Fairy! Hope you enjoyed your break, 
folks and fighters alike, cuz&#39; it&#39;s time to get back to the action! As 
you&#39;ll recall in our last match, Cobra and Siren each defeated their 
respective opponents to move onto the next round! Both Bubblegum Black 
and Skye were real tough and they gave us a good fight, so we can only 
imagine what these two ladies can bring!&quot;

&quot;But before we go onto the main event,&quot; resumed William, &quot;let&#39;s take a 
closer look at our next two contestants! First, both these pretty girls 
hail from the Battle Diva Enforcement team, a group consisting solely of 
women, dedicated to stamping out evil! Cobra is a tall, twenty-five year 
old woman who shares many traits of the animal she was named after, 
including great speed, constitution, and one hell of a grip!&quot;

&quot;Lady Siren, on the other hand,&quot; said Bonnie, &quot;is a beautiful eighteen 
year-old with the ability to use the world&#39;s spirit energies to 
manipulate objects and to blow her opponents away! She likes wearing 
suits, reading, sightseeing, and people who are outgoing!&quot;

&quot;(Is this a tournament or a dating service?)&quot; muttered Kailin. Rin 
snickered.

&quot;And now,&quot; shouted both announcers simultaneously, &quot;for the main event! 
Let the tournament BEGIN!!&quot;

Both companions didn&#39;t like such farcical attention being drawn to them, 
but they had to endure it. Father Jacob wanted to egg his students 
further than they believed they could go, and something like this, even 
at its flashiest, was a good idea. For the second time that day, Mora 
Johsen was up against one of her fellow Divas, one whose tactics she 
knew very well. Neither could possibly be at a disadvantage; they had 
once been lovers for a few months, but disbanding for other pursuits. 
Rediscovering each other in the Divas was a surprise; working together 
just gave them more knowledge about each other&#39;s ways.

They tried to face off quietly, with dignity and honor, but staring each 
other down wore off after a few minutes, and the fans grew restless. The 
dome soon filled with jeers and demands for hot girl-on-girl fighting 
action. Cobra and Siren spared each other a shared look of aggravation, 
and went into battle despite their reluctance. If given the chance, they 
would&#39;ve stood there all day, letting their wills do battle and not 
their fists. Siren struck first, Cobra second&#151;both hit hard, opening 
skin and creating new wounds. They fell back and judged each other 
again, and charged, and again.

Siren relinquished her sword in favor of a more honorable approach; her 
limbs could do damage enough if properly augmented by her spirit powers. 
Of course, she couldn&#39;t keep them going forever without seriously 
damaging her body, whereas Cobra could go at it all day and night. Also, 
the other woman had strong defenses to go with her tough hide: Siren had 
seen her companion literally take a bullet to the heart and walk away 
with the shooter in hand. Of course, she had not been her best in bed 
later that evening...

...and WHAM!! Siren felt a powerful blow strike her forehead, sending 
her smashing to the ground. Cobra had made that one serious. She forced 
herself to stand and fight back. Mora could provide a temporary shield 
around her body to stop blows, and nearly every impact was absorbed as 
such. Siren knew she couldn&#39;t defeat the older woman unless she used the 
powers she hated; Cobra knew she would have to hurt her former lover to 
win.

&quot;Might as well,&quot; they both whispered&#151;but Siren&#39;s blow was far deadlier. 
She knew Mora&#39;s weakness. Her arms spread apart for a lethal hug as she 
whispered to the voices of the world, begging for their aid, searching 
for the ghosts of frost and ice upon the two poles of the planet... 
Cobra braced herself for the blow, but knew she was beaten: cold weather 
nearly destroyed her. A blast of spiritual icy wind crashed into her, 
nearly crippling her, and for good measure, Siren swung again, and again 
if necessary. She won by knockout; Cobra cursed but gave up the victory.

Naoma, as always, was there in a flash.

&quot;Wow! Amazing! What a spectacle!&quot;

Oh, brother, groaned the girls.

&quot;It&#39;s time to see our next fight!&quot; continued William, after they were 
finished tuning out Bonnie&#39;s nonsense. &quot;As you&#39;ll recall in the last 
match, Bloodbane won a marginal victory against Thunder-Claw, and 
Pandora utterly trounced poor Inferno!&quot;

&quot;(Bastard,)&quot; muttered Rin.

&quot;How will they fare against each other, though? Unfortunately, we don&#39;t 
have much information on either warrior, except they both came with Dr. 
Kamaguchi, our sponsor! Do you think they&#39;re talented, Bonnie?&quot;

&quot;They must be if they&#39;re with the good doctor&#151;but who am I to judge? 
Let&#39;s let them show us themselves!&quot;

&quot;I agree! Ladies and gentlemen, the next match: Bloodbane versus Pandora 
the Gambler!&quot; Both women climbed into the ring amidst cheers; they bowed 
to each other, though there were no bonds of friendship between them, 
and immediately got to work as soon as the bell rang, Bloodbane with her 
bizarre ability to form tools from her own blood, Pandora with her 
random deadly arts.

Not even Dr. Kamaguchi knew of Bloodbane&#39;s origins, or how she got her 
powers, or even her real name. The silvery-haired woman had simply 
arrived at the MERCS&#39; doorstep one day, seeking money and favors, and 
was granted both in exchange for a brief contract. She, like a few of 
the others working for Kamaguchi, was paying off her debt by fighting as 
Yohko&#39;s representative in the tournament. If any of them were 
victorious, the prize money would more than make up for it all, but 
Yohko had another motive for recruiting such talents...

Pandora, on the other hand, knew exactly what she was getting into when 
she signed up. Unlike the others, she wasn&#39;t seeking favors&#151;she and Dr. 
Kamaguchi shared many ideals, and were so similar at times that an 
alliance between the two seemed inevitable. Pandora was one of the 
doctor&#39;s secret weapons, though only Yohko and the Gambler knew for what 
exactly. She only fought in the Games for the thrill and the money&#151;and 
to prove to the world that even a person like her could wage war against 
those with unusual skills.

Bloodbane knew how the older woman worked and refused to give her a 
chance. She formed a thin, flexible staff that could be improvised as a 
whip and lashed out at Pandora the moment she could. With her 
cherry-hued wings, she could travel at speeds much faster than Pandora, 
and she struck so quickly that the remaining blood in her body actually 
froze briefly from the rush. Pandora didn&#39;t stand a chance, and was 
forced to the floor, tumbling into a mess&#151;

Tumbling so much, her head shook. Bloodbane gasped and realized her 
foolish error. When she could stand, the Gambler had a grin of delicious 
malice on her face.

&quot;Outcome generally positive,&quot; she announced. The roulette wheel on her 
back sprang to life: a great flash of light spun round and round, 
circling the wheel and highlighting the skills available to its 
mistress: machine guns, flamethrower, poison darts, electricity, 
hand-to-hand combat, or retreat, and one could only guess how often that 
last one showed up. At last, the light slowed and stopped, apparently on 
something good, for Pandora&#39;s grin remained.

Machine guns. Her bandoliers roared to life and opened fire. Bloodbane 
quickly reacted and stepped to the side just enough so that a bullet 
grazed her arm, and with the flowing blood, she formed a shield big 
enough to protect her somewhat. Knowing Pandora, though, her arsenal 
would continue long after the shield broke, and besides, most of those 
bullets were strays&#151;they whizzed past arms, legs, thighs, her ears, her 
hair...one burrowed its way into her calf. Another hit her in the 
shoulder. Pandora closed the gap between them, more merciless than 
before, and Bloodbane knew her defenses would shatter eventually. She 
couldn&#39;t hold it...

She quickly dove as the shield shattered, and got hit twice. The blood 
came out, and to her will, formed spikes along the ground to slow the 
Gambler. She carefully stepped over them, firing wildly, making sure her 
&quot;friend&quot; wouldn&#39;t get anywhere near her&#151;and laughed out loud the whole 
time. Hang the rules, she wanted Bloodbane dead. Or at least suffering. 
Well, maybe suffering was better.

She cheered with victory as she struck the woman hard in the chest. 
Bloodbane tumbled and did not get back up. The judges were nearly ready 
to disqualify Pandora on a deathblow technicality, but were later told 
that the wounded girl was still alive. Pandora wished she had the 
opportunity to finish the job, but she had already won. Why bother? She 
walked away, chuckling cruelly, and left the younger woman in the hands 
of the on-sight healer. Before she returned to the skybox, Pandora 
directed her eyes, both real and artificial, to Siren. And snarled.

You are next.

......

&quot;Good luck.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m gonna need it.&quot;

&quot;Bah, you&#39;ll do fine.&quot; Merry winked, Sally smiled weakly, and together 
the two entered the ring. William and Bonnie gave some quick tidbits of 
information about the two fighters&#151;Rancor was a nice girl who could be 
goofy and hyperactive one minute, enraged the next, and G-Force was 
still a beginner&#151;and let them go after each other. Of course, Sally&#39;s 
warning had come true: in the brief time they had known each other, both 
girls found themselves liking their opponents too much to get into a 
serious brawl.

However, as before, G-Force made herself go through with it and hurled a 
great force field of strengthened gravity around her new friend. Rancor 
quickly covered her body with the natural armor that she was known for, 
and withstood the attack. G-Force amplified. Rancor remained stationary. 
G-Force clenched her teeth and put as much power into it as she could, 
which was obviously having some affect. The very ring itself was 
buckling slightly from her power, yet Rancor seemed unaffected.

&quot;Come on,&quot; she could hear the elder calling, &quot;is that the best you&#39;ve 
got?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she managed, and with a flash of willpower, Sally tried something 
she had only begun to experiment with. With a bit of manipulation, she 
kept the force field around Rancor whilst lifting the area around her, 
thus making herself lighter. She leaped into the air and lowered it 
again as she landed, crashing down on the armored woman like a comet. 
Her boot struck...WHAM!

&quot;OW!!&quot; G-Force fell down, immediately dispelling all unnatural forces, 
leaving her foot the only thing scathed. Merry softened her skin and 
chuckled.

&quot;Sorry, did that hurt?&quot;

&quot;Of course!&quot; she snapped angrily. &quot;God, what&#39;re you made out of, 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;I honestly have no idea. Probably some material neither one of us could 
pronounce.&quot; G-Force had to chuckle at that, and stood again to fight. 
Using so much power had drained her, and Merry seemed just as fresh and 
eager as ever. She took a clumsy step forward and tried concentrating 
again.

&quot;Round two...&quot; The field lowered, and Merry&#39;s defenses raised. G-Force&#39;s 
vision soon became blurry, then she started to wobble, then she 
weakened, then she fell to one knee. Merry became soft and walked over, 
sensing how worn-out she was.

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t push yourself. Come on, relax.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t treat me like a child,&quot; she grumbled, refusing to be helped up. 
Merry backed off.

&quot;Okay, sorry. Uh...maybe I should just fight you honorably. I 
mean...this clearly isn&#39;t working.&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t give me an attitude or I really will knock you senseless.&quot; 
Both girls now glared at each other, but Rancor had the upper hand. 
After all, she could still stand under her own power, and G-Force...

&quot;Sor-ry. I&#39;m just...not used to...&quot;

&quot;Okay, well, then maybe I ought to do something.&quot; Merry charged after 
her, sans armor, and struck her hard&#151;G-Force fell to the ground, and 
appeared content to stay there. Merry hovered over her and crossed her 
arms. &quot;Is that better?&quot;

&quot;Some friend...you were.&quot;

&quot;Hey, I tried to help you, woman.&quot;

&quot;What did you call me?&quot;

&quot;Woman, why? You got something else I&#39;m not aware of?&quot; G-Force rolled 
around just enough to look up, and in spite of the referee counting to 
eight and beyond, she smiled.

&quot;You called me a woman. You really did. Up until now, everyone&#39;s been 
calling me a kid, or a girl, even my partners. You&#39;re just the first 
that really...&quot;

&quot;Well, you are a woman, aren&#39;t you?&quot; G-Force smiled warmly, and even 
laughed.

&quot;Yeah, I guess I am. I did just turn 18 a few months ago.&quot;

&quot;There, see? A woman. Hey, you still mad or what?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she groaned, &quot;just sore. And upset&#151;not at you, myself. You were 
great. I stink.&quot;

&quot;I dunno, ya kinda smell nice after that shower.&quot; They both blushed, and 
Merry helped her friend up once the ref made it to ten. G-Force gave her 
an unexpected hug, and dared to whisper something she had wanted to know 
for awhile.

&quot;Say Merry...would you like to go on a date with me?&quot;

&quot;Would I.&quot; They chuckled.

&quot;Thanks. Hey, sorry I was so mean. You really were great.&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop it, you&#39;re embarrassing me.&quot;

&quot;You also have a really great body. And did I tell you I&#39;m attracted to 
older women?&quot; Merry whistled, backed off, and rubbed her pink hair 
bashfully.

&quot;Whew! Oh, boy... A little too much information. But hey, at least I got 
a girlfriend out of it.&quot; They laughed again and took hands; Marissa, who 
had seen it all, stood dazed.

This is a most unexpected turn of events.

......

Nobody looked forward to the Rin-Snowblood conflict more than those 
involved, not even the fans. William and Bonnie were apt to point out 
that the two had fought before, and were looking to settle the score. 
They got it wrong by calling them rivals&#151;in truth, Snowblood had been 
assigned to kill the Ronin&#151;but in the arena, old grudges were all the 
same, no exceptions. Rin seemed to be in a moderately good mood as she 
faced her &quot;rival&quot; in the ring; Snowblood was trying to remain 
unemotional, though anyone could tell it was a fight in itself.

CLANG! The gong sounded; the two warriors chased after each other; 
Kailin forced herself to watch this time. What a fight! They were both 
moving so quickly, so fluidly, like two whirlwinds coming into contact, 
battling for supremacy. They fought like tigers, one vastly more 
powerful and the other vastly more attuned to the psychic world. They 
crashed, they collided, SMASH! They bled and bruised, they wheezed and 
begged for more, and not for one second did either of them dominate the 
fight. It was dead even down to the very end.

But what an end, and in the meantime, their war orchestrated violently, 
beautifully, mixing the horror of a fight with the splendor of a match: 
there was Snow, and Blood, and shared superiority; the two seemed more 
suited for each other than friends, than sisters, than lovers even. It 
was as if, after one single fight, they knew each other completely and 
could fight to the best of their abilities without lagging behind, for 
the other would follow suit and even push them further. Seldom had 
anyone seen anything like it. Haanz Gl&uuml;cklig gawked.

&quot;Is this the same girl I fought?&quot; he had to wonder&#151;because she certainly 
didn&#39;t look like it. That Snowblood had been strong, sure, but also 
showed clumsiness, difficulty, even ineptitude. This one was downright 
miraculous.

In time, both warriors were too exhausted to continue. They had fought 
so perfectly that they both ultimately collapsed from weariness and 
stayed down, long enough for the referee to count to ten. Still they did 
not move. The crowd became restless. Kailin chewed on her lip, wondering 
what would happen next.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, folks!&quot; barked William merrily. &quot;This is not unprecedented 
in our history! In the event of a tie match, the judges&#39; decision will 
be called on to decide the winner!&quot; The crowd grumbled, and if Rin still 
had the strength, she would&#39;ve objected to the whole thing. All she 
could do was lay there quietly and wait. The suspense hurt worse than 
anything Snowblood could give her.

&quot;Oh my!&quot; she heard Bonnie exclaim. &quot;It seems our panel of judges has 
come to a split decision! With a score of 16-14, they have favored Lady 
Snowblood as the victor!&quot; Half the crowd booed, the other half cheered, 
and even Rin, in her weakness, stirred.

&quot;No way,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;This bites! How could they? That wasn&#39;t...the 
way...it was fought.&quot;

&quot;Feeling upset?&quot; Snowblood sat up as Naoma healed her, and turned to 
give her &quot;rival&quot; a cocky smile. &quot;Don&#39;t take it too hard, Rin. Everyone 
must be defeated at some point.&quot;

&quot;You idiot,&quot; she moaned&#151;but she couldn&#39;t follow through and fell limp 
again. Naoma rolled her eyes and attended to the fallen warrior; 
Snowblood touched her shoulder once she was conscience again.

&quot;I suppose we are even now.&quot;

&quot;Even nothing, that fight was a tie!&quot;

&quot;You heard the judges.&quot;

&quot;Screw them,&quot; she pouted. Snowblood frowned, growing more irritated by 
the moment. And she had learned to respect this? Maybe Rin was more 
shallow than she appeared. Or maybe... &quot;Look, it&#39;s not what you think. 
If you had really beaten me, no big deal. I can handle that. It&#39;s those 
damn judges, saying we had a tie and then barely giving you the victory. 
That just blows.&quot;

&quot;Well, next time, we will not stop until one is the victor.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and then you&#39;ll kill me, right?&quot;

&quot;I have no intention of dying.&quot;

&quot;Hey, me neither. So how about you telling me why you gotta kill me.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; said Snowblood as she rose, &quot;I cannot do that.&quot; She walked 
away, apparently to rest, leaving Rin to wonder. Just what was her deal 
anyway? She hoped she would learn soon. Snowblood had told her how 
painful it was, going through with the assassination, but she had had no 
choice. Painful. Like it was the last thing she wanted to do, or the 
near-last. But why? If it hurt so much, why? The reason must&#39;ve been 
big.

&quot;I hope I find out soon,&quot; she murmured to herself as she joined Kailin. 
&quot;Maybe...I can help her.&quot;

Once she finished healing Rin and Snowblood, Naoma took a break from her 
duties and rushed for the nearest empty ladies&#39; restroom. Finding one, 
she locked it and hid herself in one of the stalls, then pulled a secure 
cell phone from her robes. She dialed the number quickly, knowing that 
the line would be safe, and waited to be picked up. Two rings, and a 
voice came through.

&quot;Butcher&#39;s Square on Silver Street, this is Lazlo, how may I help you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m interested in selling you some choice cuts.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am, did you acquire these yourself or did you buy them somewhere 
else?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re mine.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the weight?&quot;

&quot;It would tip the scales.&quot; He chuckled.

&quot;I hate this damned back-and-forth password mumbo-jumbo. Sashuo&#39;s a real 
prick when it comes to that&#151;oops, don&#39;t tell him I said that.&quot;

&quot;Said what?&quot; The man calling himself Lazlo chuckled again.

&quot;For an average-looking lesbian doctor, you sure are smart. So whaddyou 
have for me today, Naomi?&quot;

&quot;Naom-A,&quot; she emphasized. &quot;Not Naomi, Naoma. Please get it right.&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, keep the sand outta your skirt. So? Top priority, 
eh?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Could you please direct me to your boss?&quot;

&quot;Oh, him? He&#39;s...busy. And by that I mean...&quot;

&quot;Probably torture again,&quot; sighed Naoma. &quot;Just tell him it&#39;s urgent.&quot; 
Lazlo hissed.

&quot;Okay, but if I get my head chopped off, I expect you to fix it.&quot;

&quot;But of course. No problem at all. Now, please?&quot; She was forced to wait 
fifteen seconds, then her companion&#39;s powerful, booming voice erupted. 
Even though they were several countries apart, Naoma couldn&#39;t help but 
shudder a little. Sashuo was...so much more. More than her, more than 
Emily or Yubami, more than anybody. He was everything; he was terror and 
torture in itself. To face the Crimson Blades was something even fools 
wouldn&#39;t dare try.

&quot;What?!&quot;

&quot;I have some information&#151;&quot;

&quot;I know, now quit wasting my time and tell me.&quot;

&quot;...Yes,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Sashuo, you won&#39;t believe this, but I know the 
whereabouts of the Takamatsu girl.&quot; And for the first time since the two 
were acquainted, Sashuo seemed at a loss. At least for a second.

&quot;...Go on.&quot;

To be continued.

Cobra: It&#39;s about time I get to do this! Oh, we&#39;re on. Salutations and 
hello, everybody. Mora Johsen here, narrating for once since our friends 
seem preoccupied.

Siren: Apparently they&#39;re scouting for dates.

Cobra: Yeah, but Kris is way too shy for that stuff. Anyway, I&#39;m sure 
you all are just dying to see the finals and semifinals, but you&#39;re 
gonna have to wait a little bit longer.

Siren: Believe us when we say it&#39;ll be worth it. Let&#39;s just say that the 
winner is going to be somebody unexpected!

Cobra: Whoever it is, you can bet that &quot;somebody&quot; will be happy. wink

Siren: Hey, I saw you drooling after Rancor and Snowblood!

Cobra: Well you were gawking at Pandora!

Siren: I can&#39;t help it, she&#39;s so cool...

Cobra: Ugh, looks like Kailin was more right than she knew! Next time, 
it&#39;s winners and apparently, romances: &quot;The Iron Arena Games, Part 
Three&quot;.

Siren: We swear it&#39;s the conclusion to this thing.</pre>
