<h1>Bloody Guardian (part 7 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/bloodguard-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Ireland burned, and Heather McKennit felt helpless as the black haired 
woman watched the flames spread. It was nineteen sixty nine, and as 
August continued the Protestants and Catholics waged war against each 
other in Belfast. The police were actually helping Protestants burn out 
Catholic neighborhoods, and they were fighting back with every weapon 
they could lay hands on.

&#39;An&#39; I need to get to cover,&#39; Heather thought grimly as she hurried down 
a side street, thankfully away from the spreading violence. She had come 
to look into her relations, curious to see if her family bloodline had 
survived, but obviously she had picked the worst time to come.

&quot;Hey, you there!&quot; a police man cried, &quot;What are you doing out at this 
time of night?&quot;

Heather stopped, growling with frustration as she stood on the cobbled 
alleyway. Part of her wanted to tell the officer it was none of his 
business, but this wasn&#39;t the time. &quot;Just trying to get back to my 
lodgings,&quot; she said, using her best American accent.

&quot;Huh,&quot; the guard relaxed a bit as the shorter brown haired man peered up 
at her, &quot;visiting the home country, are you?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Heather answered honestly.

He pushed back his cap and scratched his head as he said, &quot;Pardon my 
asking, but why are ye visiting now?&quot;

Heather smiled, careful to hide her fangs as she told him, &quot;Trust me, 
I&#39;m asking myself that same question.&quot;

The older man fought back a laugh at that rueful comment. &quot;All right, 
ye&#39;d best hurry home,&quot; he said seriously, &quot;the streets aren&#39;t safe 
tonight.&quot;

&#39;You can say that again,&#39; Heather thought as she nodded to him 
respectfully, &quot;You be careful too, sir.&quot;

&quot;Do my best,&quot; he smiled a bit sadly before shuffling off into the night.

&#39;He might die tonight, depending on where he&#39;s sent,&#39; Heather thought as 
she peered at the man, &#39;or end up killing some other damn fool.&#39; With a 
sigh she pulled her jacked around her and hurried off.

The inn Heather chose was nearer the docks, a tactical decision made 
from long habit that she felt somewhat grateful for now. Hopefully she 
could get organized and get home before the riots got any closer or the 
inn staff began to ask questions about their pretty nocturnal guest.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; the old man at the desk rumbled as Heather hurried 
inside. He sat on a high chair behind the battered old counter, puffing 
thoughtfully on a pipe. Whenever Heather looked at him she had the urge 
to ask if he really liked smoking that thing, or if he just thought that 
was what a Irish innkeeper should have.

&quot;Crazy night,&quot; Heather said wryly as she took off her coat, smiling 
grimly.

&quot;That it is,&quot; he agreed, &quot;best stay in the rest of tonight, miss. I 
think it&#39;ll get worse before it gets better.&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Heather agreed as she made her way up to her rooms. She 
slowed as she went down the hallway, nose twitching as she picked up a 
scent where it should not be. &#39;There&#39;s someone in my rooms,&#39; Heather 
thought grimly.

Inching her way silently up the dimly lit hall Heather stuck close to 
the walls. Reaching the door she cautiously reached out to the handle 
and turned it slowly, tensing her muscles. With a push she sent the 
wooden door open, ducking and rolling as she went into her room.

&quot;Hellspawn!&quot; the bosomy blonde yelled as the crossbow she was carrying 
twanged, sending a arrow right above Heather&#39;s head to where her heart 
might have been if she was standing in the doorway.

Swiftly Heather kicked out, sending the crossbow flying before the woman 
could reload. &quot;What are you...&quot; she started to ask only to yelp as the 
woman tried to stab her with a knife.

&quot;Die, creature from the pit!&quot; the woman yelled as she swung with a 
dangerous looking curved blade.

&quot;Wha&#39;s all this then?&quot; the innkeeper growled as he thumped across the 
floor, leaning on his cane.

&#39;Oh great, witnesses,&#39; Heather thought as she jumped back from another 
cut. &quot;Sir, get back,&quot; she yelled in warning.

&quot;Daddy?&quot; the young woman faltered.

&quot;Daddy?!&quot; Heather echoed, blinking.

&quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing, Colleen?!&quot; the older man growled as he 
swiftly disarmed the girl of various edged weapons.

The newly dubbed Colleen looked sheepish, &quot;But she&#39;s a vampire, Da!&quot;

Her father rubbed a hand over his face as he sighed, &quot;She&#39;s not a 
vampire, she&#39;s a writer.&quot;

&quot;And how do you know she&#39;s a real writer?&quot; Colleen whined, &quot;She&#39;s pale, 
she sleeps during the day and has those neat eyes...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; the old man casually grabbed Colleen by the ear and 
began to drag her off, &quot;I think my daughter and I need to have a little 
talk.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Heather answered wryly.

&quot;Daddy!&quot; Colleen whined as she was tugged along, &quot;That hurts!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tan your hide if you ever try something like that again,&quot; he 
growled as he frogmarched his daughter around the corner.

&quot;Bye,&quot; Heather waved farewell to the girl, then turned to look at the 
arrow sticking out the hallway wall. &#39;Do I want to pull it out?&#39; she 
mused, &#39;Nah, not my problem.&#39;

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

&quot;You&#39;re kidding,&quot; Angela Rowan chuckled, her eyes alight with mirth, 
&quot;You were really attacked as a vampire?&quot; The elegantly dressed 
auctioneer was at the publishing house Heather used to produce her short 
stories, apparently there on business.

&quot;One of my more surreal trips,&quot; Heather admitted, having given the woman 
a somewhat edited account of that night. She had no need to know it had 
happened during the infamous Belfast riots and other such details.

&quot;Hey, Angela,&quot; one of the usual editors breezed in, the blonde haired 
man giving them both insincere smiles.

&quot;Hello Thomas,&quot; Heather recognized him instantly. She looked over at 
Angela, &quot;After shaking hands, check you have the right number of 
fingers. Also, count your wallet before going into his office.&quot;

Thomas pushed his wavy blonde hair back, his blue eyes looking hurt. 
&quot;Heather, you&#39;re so cruel,&quot; he sighed sadly.

&quot;Is he really that bad?&quot; Angela looked over at Heather a bit worriedly.

&quot;He&#39;s a shark,&quot; Heather shrugged, &quot;but he&#39;ll play fair, mostly. Just 
don&#39;t agree to anything without your agent there.&quot;

Thomas gave her a withering look, clearly unhappy about the advice she 
gave. He looked at her thoughtfully as something occurred to him, 
&quot;Actually, I may have a job for you.&quot;

Heather gave him a wary look as she asked, &quot;You do remember what I told 
you I&#39;d do the last time you screwed me over?&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Thomas paled slightly, &quot;really, this is a serious deal!&quot;

&quot;What did you threaten him with?&quot; Angela whispered as the two of them 
followed Thomas back to his office.

Heather smirked slightly, &quot;To rip his balls off and turn them into a key 
chain.&quot;

Angela paled, &quot;He pissed you off that much?&quot;

&quot;That,&quot; Heather conceded, &quot;and I find a graphic threat usually works 
better.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; Angela said wryly.

Thomas&#39; office was like many editors&#39;, neat on the surface but a 
disaster waiting to happen if anyone opened the wrong closet door. 
Heather settled into a seat after she offered Angela her pick, then she 
looked at Thomas and asked, &quot;What&#39;s the deal?&quot;

Thomas nodded towards Angela, &quot;As a auctioneer she&#39;s dealt with a number 
of exotic items, and has offered our company the opportunity to publish 
a collection of her on the job photos and stories.&quot;

&quot;The problem is,&quot; Angela confessed, &quot;I&#39;m a historian, not a writer.&quot;

Heather processed that as she studied Thomas, &quot;So, I assume you want me 
to process Ms. Rowan&#39;s historical notes into more gripping prose?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Thomas nodded.

&quot;Do I get a writer&#39;s credit or is it ghost writing?&quot; Heather asked. &quot;If 
it&#39;s a ghost, I want a bigger cut,&quot; she cautioned.

&quot;Ghost?&quot; Angela asked, frowning.

Heather looked at her with a slight smile, &quot;If I ghost the book for you, 
only your name will be on the cover. In the liner notes it might mention 
I was a consultant, but it won&#39;t say I rewrote your stuff.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s... kind of deceitful,&quot; Angela blinked.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Thomas admitted as he sorted through some papers, &quot;but readers 
generally prefer to see one name on a book cover.&quot;

&quot;Write me a contract and send it to my agent first,&quot; Heather ordered, 
&quot;I&#39;m not signing now.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Angela agreed hastily.

Thomas sighed, &quot;Heather, you&#39;re bad for business.&quot;
