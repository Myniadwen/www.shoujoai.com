<h1>Project Angelus (part 25 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>      When she entered the hotel suite, Eveon was shocked to be assaulted by her mother. By 
assault, she meant lots of kisses and hugs and &#39;are you alright?!&#39;. &quot;I&#39;m fine mommy, but 
Mina...&quot;

      Her mother nodded sadly, still hugging her. &quot;I know. We&#39;ll figure something out.&quot;

      &quot;Is there a room we can take her?&quot; Hoshi asked, interrupting the mother daughter 
reunion. Miki was still passed out and bleeding in the woman&#39;s arms.

      &quot;Krystal is in the adjoining room...&quot; Sakura said, pointing to the door that 
connected the suites. &quot;She should be able to help.&quot;

      Hoshi and her sisters went over there to get Miki healed as Abby guided Eveon to the 
couch. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry all this happened.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Eveon said, now having calmed down. &quot;Stuff happens...&quot;

      Sakura sat down next to her, delicately playing with Eveon&#39;s hair. &quot;I wish... I had 
been faster...&quot;

      Eveon shook her head. &quot;Like I said it&#39;s fine. If one more person tries to apologize, 
I think I will have to smack them.&quot;

      That was when Isaka came into the room. &quot;Eveon, I&#39;m so sorry!&quot;

      Abby let out a sigh. &quot;Well you can smack her since she was in charge of watching your 
girlfriend.&quot;

      The demon fidgeted uncomfortably. &quot;I... I should have gotten to Mina before Lilith... 
I mean, it was obvious that Mina was a target so I don&#39;t know what we were thinking when-&quot;

      Eveon laughed quietly. &quot;Isaka, you didn&#39;t kidnap Mina... you didn&#39;t turn her into a 
Death Doll. Will you please stop blaming yourself? Right now, we have to figure out how to 
save her, not get upset.&quot;

      All three woman looked at the teenager. Abby gave her daughter a kiss on the head. 
&quot;When did you get so mature?&quot;

      &quot;When I realized we&#39;re going to need some serious brain power to save Mina,&quot; Eveon 
countered dryly. &quot;The fiend, Pandora, said it was irreversible.&quot;

      A commotion suddenly rang out in the other room.

      &quot;You can just do that to an injured person!&quot; came Tsuru&#39;s astonished voice.

      &quot;Mistress, maybe you should take her out of the room,&quot; Hoshi advised.

      &quot;No!&quot; was Carmilla&#39;s horrified cry. &quot;I need yummy virgin girl blood! I haven&#39;t fed 
since Mina was kidnapped!&quot;

      Thus, Tsuru came out of the other room, dragging Carmilla out. &quot;Snap out of it! You 
can&#39;t just lick that girl&#39;s wounds like a wild animal!&quot;

      &quot;B-b-but couldn&#39;t you smell how delicious it was?! I need my fill of human blood!&quot; 
Regardless, Tsuru kept pulling Carmilla out of the room and into Abby and Sakura&#39;s suite.

      &quot;Isn&#39;t Miki a hybrid?&quot; Eveon commented. &quot;Why would Carmilla want to drink her blood?&quot;

      At the sound of her voice, Carmilla stopped struggling. &quot;Eveon! You&#39;re back!&quot;

      The blonde smiled. &quot;Yeah, safe and sound.&quot;

      Tsuru tried to grab at the vampire, but it was already too late. Carmilla lunged at 
the couch, frightening the hell out of Eveon who scrambled over it. The vampire followed 
suit and tackled her to the ground. &quot;Oh, how I&#39;ve missed your delicious blood Eveon...!&quot;

      Eveon let out a scream of surprised as Carmilla bit down. She&#39;d forgotten how it felt 
to be bit... It didn&#39;t take long for Carmilla to be the one screaming as something scorched 
her back. She rolled off of Eveon, licking at the blood on her lips.

      Sakura was glaring at her, a myriad of flames growing in her palm. &quot;First it&#39;s holy 
power and now the flames of Purgatory...?&quot; Carmilla whimpered as the fire turned into 
Sakura&#39;s scythe and the armor appeared as flames burst around her body.

      &quot;W-wait, Sakura!&quot; Abby cried out, trying to grab her lover and prevent her from 
reaping Carmilla&#39;s undead soul.

      &quot;Save me, Tsuru!&quot; The vampire ducked behind an unwilling Demon Lord, who wasn&#39;t too 
excited about being in the crosshairs of a newly reborn Living Inferno.

      Isaka sat down on the couch with a sigh as Eveon crawled around to watch the 
spectacle, all the while holding a hand to the bite wounds on her neck. &quot;Some things never 
change,&quot; the demon huffed. 

***** 

      &quot;That&#39;s about all my healing powers can do,&quot; Krystal said, happy to have made most of 
the cuts smaller. &quot;Just dress the wounds and she should be okay.&quot;

      &quot;We can take care of that,&quot; Tsuki said.

      &quot;Yeah, you should go say hi to Eveon!&quot; Hina added.

      Krystal sighed. &quot;I feel like such a fool for losing Mina like that...&quot;

      Hoshi shook her head. &quot;We wouldn&#39;t have fared any better. So far, it seems that 
Sakura and Tsuru are our only chances...&quot;

      The blonde nodded before heading into the other room. Tsuki began to take out some of 
the gauze and bandages from the first aid kit. &quot;I can&#39;t believe Miki got hurt this badly,&quot; 
Hina said with a groan.

      &quot;She&#39;ll be alright,&quot; Hoshi assured her. &quot;Let&#39;s just start with her injuries.&quot;

      Hina ended up putting some band-aids on Miki&#39;s cheek and forehead before she frowned. 
&quot;Why are you taking off her clothes?&quot;

      Tsuki was in the middle of unzipping Miki&#39;s jacket and Hoshi was pulling down the 
girl&#39;s pants. &quot;To... uh... um,&quot; Tsuki choked out.

      &quot;To check if she&#39;s injured anywhere else,&quot; Hoshi argued, pointing to a bruise on 
Miki&#39;s exposed thigh. &quot;We have to be sure.&quot;

      Hina didn&#39;t believe them, but she didn&#39;t mind looking at Miki&#39;s body (and she was 
sure her sisters felt the same way).

      In the end, the young girl was left in only her bra and panties. Hoshi would have 
laughed at the frogs and soccer ball print, but she and Tsuki were paying attention to 
something more... interesting. Hina noticed her sisters weren&#39;t doing much else but looking 
so she turned her gaze to what they found so enthralling.

      Hina had turned herself around so she could look down at the strange mark on Miki&#39;s 
navel. Tsuki reached out and traced the black tattoo tenderly until a shock made her pull 
away. &quot;Ow...&quot; she groaned.

      &quot;It reacted to your holy power,&quot; Hoshi said before she started to trace the mark. It 
was smooth and completely black, like a tattoo. It began to resonate with Hoshi&#39;s power, 
giving off a blue greenish glow. Miki let out a small sound, but she was still asleep.

      Hina looked over at her sisters. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t tease her like that.&quot;

      Tsuki just giggled as Hoshi said, &quot;Ah, but Miki&#39;s head is in between your legs.&quot;

      Hina was on her hands and knees and looked to see that Hoshi was right. Since she was 
staring down at the mark on Miki&#39;s navel, her knees were on either side of the unconscious 
girl&#39;s head.

      &quot;Big sister,&quot; Hina started. &quot;Do you want us to... include Miki in our relationship?&quot;

      Hoshi blinked, turning bright red. &quot;Well, I never actually supposed she would ever, 
ah...&quot;

      &quot;Why not?&quot; Tsuki said suddenly with a small smile. &quot;She can be like our honorary 
sister.&quot;

      Hina took a moment to think but nodded vigorously. &quot;Yeah! Miki lost her sister so 
maybe we can help her by being her sisters instead.&quot;

      Hoshi smiled. &quot;That sounds good... we&#39;ll be sure to inform Miki of the great news 
when she wakes up.&quot;

      Of course, Miki started to awake that moment with a throbbing head. She had been 
fighting Lilith and... and... there were hands touching her stomach?

      Miki opened her eyes, startled to see white fabric in front of her. She became even 
more horrified to discover that the white fabric was really the junction of the pants that 
Hina was wearing. The young girl began to panic as she felt the hands again on her 
stomach... she was almost naked...!

      She resisted the urge to get up, knowing that if she raised her head, she would come 
in contact with Hina&#39;s... Hina&#39;s... Miki swallowed uncomfortably and suddenly let out a 
scream.

      Hina lost her balance and her hands slipped out from under her, causing her to fall 
off to the side. Tsuki and Hoshi stopped touching her. &quot;Wow... all that from just touching 
her stomach,&quot; the silver haired woman joked, getting a slight pinch from the brunette.

      Miki started to get up, but her head was throbbing and she fell back down on the bed. 
The three sisters looked at her as she rubbed the back of her head with a groan. Hoshi was 
the first to speak. &quot;Miki, we wanted to let you know that we&#39;re always going to be here to 
support you... you don&#39;t have any family left, do you?&quot;

      She shook her head and Hina smiled. &quot;Well, we can be like your surrogate family!&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s nice,&quot; Miki groaned, not really paying attention.

      Tsuki looked over at her sisters. &quot;Does this mean we should do some family bonding?&quot;

      The green eyed girl became alarmed as the sisters started taking her to the bathroom. 
&quot;H-Hold on a second! What are you doing?&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;re going to take a bath together,&quot; Hina stated happily.

      &quot;You are going to be like a sister, after all,&quot; Hoshi said, giving Miki a certain 
kind of look.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Tsuki said. &quot;We&#39;re just going to help you clean yourself since you are 
injured.&quot; 

***** 

      Everyone in the next room over became alert at the sound of a scream, except for 
Eveon. &quot;Who is that?&quot; Krystal asked, looking over at the door connecting the rooms. It was 
the second one they&#39;d heard already.

      Eveon took a sip from her glass of water. &quot;Probably Miki getting harassed by Hoshi, 
Tsuki and Hina. They keep trying to get her to switch teams.&quot;

      Tsuru flushed bright red. &quot;Great... I should probably have a talk with them about 
that...&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;d listen to their mistress,&quot; Isaka said with a laugh, causing Carmilla 
to pout.

      &quot;I still don&#39;t see why they have to call you that,&quot; the vampire protested as she 
stirred her tea.

      Abby leaned back against the couch, snuggling into Sakura. &quot;Well, what does she 
expect? I mean, at least she isn&#39;t with Erin and Faye.&quot;

      Tsuru turned even more red at remembering that, causing Carmilla to get more 
agitated. Krystal was still looking at the door. &quot;I hope she&#39;s alright... I remember how 
strange it was when Hoshi was trying to seduce me.&quot;

      Isaka stared at her girlfriend. &quot;She didn&#39;t... actually do anything...&quot;

      The demon sighed. &quot;Poor Miki... maybe this is her just desserts for kidnapping 
Eveon?&quot;

      The blonde girl shook her head. &quot;But Miki&#39;s really cool. I mean, she basically 
protected me from everything that&#39;s happened so far.&quot;

      That was when the door to other room flew open. &quot;No! I don&#39;t need help drying 
myself!&quot;

      There was a bit of commotion until Miki tripped and fell backwards through the 
doorway with only a towel covering her. The sisters were trying to help her up, but she 
merely pushed herself away, thoroughly embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;m perfectly fine!&quot;

      &quot;So that&#39;s your awesome protector?&quot; Isaka asked, making the green eyed girl realize 
she had an audience. Miki stood up, flushed and trying to readjust the towel so no one saw 
anything.

      &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Eveon asked.

      &quot;No, I&#39;m not! They just helped me take a bath!&quot; Hoshi, Tsuki and Hina did their best 
to look completely innocent, but Tsuru just let out a long sigh.

      &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be doing that to girls,&quot; Tsuru chastised.

      &quot;Yeah!&quot; Miki said, pointing at them. &quot;I don&#39;t want to be washed in a bathtub by a 
bunch of girls! Who would enjoy that?!&quot;

      Her question was met by a few laughs. &quot;Well,&quot; Abby said thoughtfully before looking 
at Sakura. &quot;It would depend on the girl.&quot;

      Miki went from red to a pale white in an instance. &quot;Wait... everyone here is a 
lesbian, aren&#39;t they?&quot;

      Eveon nodded, taking another drink of water. &quot;Yep... you should just be glad Erin and 
Faye aren&#39;t here or you&#39;d really be in trouble...&quot;

      There was a lull of silence until Miki was dragged back into the other room. &quot;We need 
to get you changed into some clothes,&quot; Hoshi whispered into her ear.

      Thus, Miki had to go back to more &#39;family bonding&#39; with the sisters. &quot;Hey, Isaka, 
what does your gaydar say about her?&quot; Krystal asked.

      The demon thought for a moment before shrugging. &quot;I think she&#39;s straight, but her 
fierce denial is just egging them on.&quot;

      Sakura tilted her head in confusion. &quot;If they keep trying... what will happen to 
Miki?&quot;

      Abby laughed to herself as she answered the question. &quot;Well, she&#39;ll probably be 
embarrassed to tell anyone how she lost her virginity.&quot;
