<h1>Project Angelus (part 5 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>      Miki cradled her left arm to her chest, running furiously through the forest. The 
break in had been a disaster... she could have taken all the guards out, but they&#39;d already 
called for backup from the major headquarters and that would mean...

      It wasn&#39;t in her best interest to face off against top operatives of the Shadow 
Organization. Tears stung her eyes as the failure to rescue the prisoner struck her heart. 
A young woman was being tortured and she couldn&#39;t even save her...! All the break ins were 
to find her location, but now...

      Miki had no time to worry as she suddenly ran into a person. She let out a yell as 
the bullet wounds in her left arm screeched. She looked through teary eyes to see none 
other than Eveon.

      A very bloody Eveon.

      &quot;Oh my God - what happened to you?!&quot; Miki asked, suddenly forgetting her own 
problems. &quot;Are you alright? Did you get shot?&quot;

      Eveon shook her head. &quot;No! No - the girl, the angel, in the room, I was trying to 
save her and she bled everywhere and I cut my hands and-&quot;

      &quot;Is she alright? She&#39;s alive? But you&#39;re hurt-&quot;

      &quot;Miki, you&#39;ve been shot?!&quot;

      Amidst the commotion of the argument, Eveon&#39;s right hand erupted in white light 
again. The blonde covered her eyes as a warm sensation went through the cuts on her hands 
and arms. It faded and when Eveon looked again, Miki was moving her left arm normally.

      &quot;Eveon...&quot; the girl asked. &quot;What did you just do?&quot;

      &quot;I... I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s never happened,&quot; Eveon said, before looking down at her 
hand. It was glowing white.

      The teenager began to shake her hand furiously. &quot;What the hell-! Why isn&#39;t it going 
away?&quot;

      Miki grabbed her hand and looked at the back. The white light was taking the form of 
some symbol on Eveon&#39;s hand and the girl could only think back to-

      &quot;Where did you get this?&quot; Miki asked, fear leaking into her voice.

      &quot;The... the angel, she kissed my hand and told me to run while she stalled...?&quot; Eveon 
watched as the mark faded away into nothingness, but she knew the power was still there.

      Miki took a moment to collect herself before shouting an expletive at the top of her 
lungs. &quot;You have to be kidding me,&quot; she moaned out. &quot;She gave you the Seal of Light... aw 
crap...&quot;

      She started massage her temples. &quot;That must have been why they tortured her and... 
oh, we have got to get going!&quot;

      Without warning, Miki grabbed Eveon and started running. &quot;The Seal of Light?! What is 
it?!&quot; Eveon shouted.

      &quot;It&#39;s the-!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...Key to God.&quot;

      The angel didn&#39;t move in response to the words spoken to her. She was tied up in the 
chains once again, though she was thankful for the lack of barbed wire. She could only hope 
that the human girl she met had run far, far away with the Seal safely deposited on her 
hand.

      &quot;I don&#39;t like repeating myself. I want the Key to God,&quot; Lilith said, looking at the 
bloody angel. &quot;We&#39;ve been repeating this for weeks...&quot;

      On the inside, she was scared. The thief had almost run off with a prized possession 
- the Guardian of Light, the angel with the ability to grant worthiness upon a human 
female. Lilith was still human, even if altered, and she was the one who wanted that key.

      The angel knew that she had to pretend she still had the Seal of Light to hand out, 
but once it was given to a host, it could never be removed. If she could just buy enough 
time and trick the Shadow Organization, then maybe the girl could get far enough away...

      Her thoughts were cut off as Lilith reached for a knife on the tray. &quot;You took out a 
lot of operatives today, so I think you&#39;re in for a little punishment.&quot; The spotlight was 
on and the metal reflected in light.

      Lilith pointed it at the angel, who only closed her eyes. &quot;I could do this all day, 
you know? Angel blood is rare... and valuable... and useful.&quot;

      Her high heel boots clicked against the floor as she approached the girl, her arm 
already scarred. Lilith smiled to herself as she heard the first sounds of a whimper. 

***** 

      Sakura was a mess. She hadn&#39;t cried... well, she hadn&#39;t cried this much since she 
killed Tycara. Abby was trying her hardest to keep herself together, but it wasn&#39;t any 
good. Mina was at the house, just hoping that the worst hadn&#39;t happened to Eveon...

      When they got the miracle phone call from the missing girl, Sakura was crying so much 
over the phone, that Seth had to take it for her.

      &quot;Hello?&quot; he said quickly.

      &quot;Hey... I&#39;m, uh... alive and well and haven&#39;t been turned into a demon,&quot; Eveon said.

      Seth smiled. &quot;That&#39;s great to hear. Everyone else is out looking for you...!&quot;

      &quot;Wow, ha, thanks guys... um, but I have a problem... do you remember how Faye and 
Erin talked about the key to their Creator?&quot;

      Seth had a bad feeling about this... &quot;I think I may have... gotten a hold of that 
key.&quot; 

***** 

      When Miki got done with her shower and came out to room, Eveon was lying on the 
bedspread, telling Mina how much she loved her. The 16 year old could only listen awkwardly 
as she dried her hair. When she finished up, Eveon looked up at Miki and quickly moved over 
on the bed.

      Miki had rented a single bed hotel room and that&#39;s where they currently were. 
&quot;Everyone is on their way to get me,&quot; Eveon said simply. &quot;So you don&#39;t have to worry about 
protecting me.&quot;

      The green eyed girl shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but you&#39;ll have to call them back. We 
have to keep moving. We should try to get to the next town by midnight.&quot;

      Eveon gawked at her. &quot;B... but the sun is setting right now!&quot;

      &quot;Do you want to have the Shadow Organization on our tails? I&#39;m not trying to be 
mean...&quot; Miki murmured. &quot;If... If you get tired, I&#39;ll carry you.&quot;

      The blonde didn&#39;t look all that happy. &quot;This is crazy. My friends are really strong 
and they&#39;ll be able to protect-&quot;

      Suddenly Eveon stopped and looked at the window. She frowned a bit before looking at 
Miki. &quot;How come... how come it&#39;s called the sight when you can feel something is wrong?&quot;

      Her companion just started to pack up her small amount of belongings. She had lent 
Eveon some clean clothes, so they were all set to go. &quot;I have a feeling that it isn&#39;t the 
Shadow Organization then... let&#39;s go.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Solomon said over the phone. &quot;I found a girl with the sight... 
yes... no, no, it was her step-daughter.&quot; He paused as his superior continued talking.

      Solomon sighed. &quot;Yes, the rumors are true. I believe she&#39;s involved with a human 
woman... hmm... two daughters... I don&#39;t know why the half breed is a live... I..! 
Alright.&quot;

      He hung up and looked down at his haphazardly bandaged arm. The girl who attacked him 
had cut at the arm that was holding Eveon. He&#39;d been so close to adding a new fiend to the 
world, too...

      &quot;Solomon!&quot; He perked up at the sound of a girl&#39;s voice. He started down the hallway 
of the mansion before reaching the audience room.

      A young girl was seated on top of a makeshift throne, currently combing the hair of a 
girl kneeling in front of her. &quot;Solomon... you&#39;re late,&quot; she murmured, not looking up from 
her task as she started on a braid.

      He bowed slightly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Pandora. I was just talking to our master... the 
leader of the Shadow Organization.&quot;

      &quot;Oh, him again?&quot; She said before looking up. &quot;Does he need help- Solomon! What 
happened to your arm?!&quot;

      She pushed the girl away from her, the braid unfinished. Solomon held out his arm 
with a slight grimace. &quot;Oh, I just tried to kidnap a girl with the sight and it didn&#39;t go 
so well.&quot;

      Pandora started to heal his wounds with her dark magic. &quot;Oh, you got hurt trying to 
get me a new toy?&quot;

      He nodded. &quot;Yes, I figured I could do the master&#39;s work and get you a present. I was 
planning on grabbing her later tonight...&quot;

      She smiled. &quot;Then I&#39;ll let my other toys do the dirty work for you. You need to rest. 
They can find the girl,&quot; she said motioning to all the people lining the room.

      Except, they weren&#39;t normal people and Solomon knew this very well. Every a human had 
caught either of their eyes, Pandora and him were sure to kidnap them. Then... Pandora 
worked a magic and...

      Each one of her toys were dressed in some type of uniform - the guys, something akin 
to military style outfit Solomon wore. For the girls, different variations of a black 
gothic Lolita dress, not unlike that of Pandora&#39;s own. Because she loved her &#39;dolls&#39; so 
much, she covered each of their faces with white masks, upon which she painted whatever she 
pleased.

      Pandora flicked back a bit of her gray hair as she went over to the toy she 
abandoned. Solomon watched in contentment as she finished braiding the masked girl&#39;s hair. 
Perhaps all the dolls weren&#39;t truly fiends, but... the leader of the Shadow Organization 
had promised to give them the ability to convert humans into such.

      Solomon watched as Pandora ordered some of her dolls out to go fight. She kept her 
favorites close by and she had a good hundred around their mansion. &quot;Someday,&quot; Pandora 
said, petting one of her boy dolls. &quot;Someday, they call all be fiends and we can all be a 
big family.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;C...can&#39;t we get a bus...?&quot;

      Miki let out a sigh. &quot;Sorry Eveon... I don&#39;t have any change - I only have a debit 
card...&quot;

      Which would explain why the two teenage girls had to walk down the sidewalk instead 
of hailing a taxi or - well, there were no taxis around or bus stops since they seemed to 
have the ability to just wander into deserted places.

      &quot;You know... is it just bad luck that we always seem to find ourselves alone?&quot; Eveon 
asked with a yawn.

      Miki shook her head. &quot;No, sometimes fiends can influence people to stay away from 
certain areas. That allows them to easily attack with no one around. It doesn&#39;t work so 
well on persistent people, but...&quot;

      Eveon was looking over at a two story building. &quot;So... that&#39;s probably why there are 
shadows on the roof that look suspiciously like people with weapons?&quot;

      Miki drew her sword. &quot;Probably. Are they fiends?&quot;

      &quot;I dunno. If you can&#39;t see them, then I suppose they are.&quot;

      As Miki turned around, the shadows on the building struck. A knife barely missed her 
and it was then that she could see her opponents. &quot;Stay behind me, Eveon. They&#39;re probably 
after you.&quot;

      The blonde did as she was told, watching their attackers jump down onto the street. 
Each one was wearing all black with masks on their face.

      Miki tensed up. &quot;Aw crap... I didn&#39;t realize that the fiend after you could control 
Death Dolls... this is bad...&quot;

      &quot;I left my magical dictionary at home,&quot; Eveon said, not liking all the shiny weapons 
the dolls had. &quot;Care to elaborate?&quot;

      &quot;They&#39;re humans, demons... whatever... they&#39;ve been magically altered into loyal 
soldiers without minds of their own. They&#39;re like puppets,&quot; Miki said, slowly backing up. 
&quot;And they&#39;re really, really good at killing and kidnapping people...&quot;

      At that, a doll leaped at her, brandishing a sword. Miki quickly parried, but had to 
duck to avoid a knife before jumping to avoid a spear. She had no choice but to fight - 
running with Eveon would be too hard.

      Miki pushed away her opponents, barely avoiding each attack. There were five of them, 
and one of her. Before she could react, a girl pierced her shoulder with a rapier and the 
sixteen year old had to quickly step away to avoid another man&#39;s claws. It only took one 
sweep of a spear for her to land on her butt.

      &quot;Miki!&quot; Eveon came over to her. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t this be a great time to run?&quot;

      &quot;You run, I&#39;ll stay,&quot; the green eyed girl said quickly.

      Eveon didn&#39;t have a chance to respond before a sickle had been thrown at them. Miki 
reacted quickly, shielding Eveon with her back. She let out little more than a groan at the 
wound.

      &quot;Jeez, Miki! Let me-&quot; Eveon&#39;s right hand started to glow, but Miki quickly grabbed 
it.

      &quot;Don&#39;t you dare use that power! If they see it,&quot; the girl hissed, &quot;Then everyone will 
know that you have the key...!&quot;

      Eveon reluctantly let the white light fade and watched Miki turn back around to face 
their attackers. &quot;I got this,&quot; Miki said, plunging her sword into the ground.

      A strange, ethereal blue-green light shot from the blade, into the concrete. Eveon 
gaped as it erupted beneath the Death Dolls and sent them flying, along with chunks of the 
street. It wasn&#39;t until Miki tugged at her to run that she broke out of her daze.

      &quot;You have magical powers?&quot; Eveon asked.

      &quot;This really isn&#39;t the time!&quot; Miki said, pulling her along. &quot;Those Death Dolls are 
pretty resilient so we need to get out of here!&quot;
