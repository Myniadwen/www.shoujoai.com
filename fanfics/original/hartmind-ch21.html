<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 21 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>That evening after Beth received Star&#39;s letter the three girls visited 
Beth&#39;s place, to confirm with her mother that Star was indeed moving to 
Whetshores. Beth&#39;s mother, whom insisted they refer to her by her first 
name, Jasmine, was a kind young woman in her late twenties who dressed 
in complete contrast to her daughter&#39;s dark attire, tending to wear a 
lot of long light pastel dresses that had many ruffles and her long 
brown hair held up by a bandana tie-dyed bandana. Next to each other it 
was hard not believe that they two were actually mother and daughter 
unless they looked very closely. The only similarity between the two was 
their green eyes and taste for lots of jewellery. Jasmine seemed to 
match her daughter&#39;s attraction to earrings with an equal attraction to 
large bracelets that jingled as she walked. She claimed that several 
helped her control her own &quot;gift&quot;, she always referred to psychic powers 
as a &quot;gift&quot; and was not ashamed to mention that she held more then a few 
talents when it came to future telling and the like. 

Trish and Sam had met the woman on several occasions, but never for very 
long for she was a very busy woman and always running out the door. She 
was very accepting of her daughter&#39;s chooses in life and hugged Trish 
when she was told that the two of them were dating, telling the girl 
that she was welcome to visit at anytime and fussing over how good her 
daughter&#39;s taste in girl&#39;s were, causing Trish to flush brightly. 

Beth&#39;s mother blinked at the group of girls as they stood at the door to 
the kitchen, Beth up front with Trish and Sam behind her, asking about 
Star&#39;s new home, &quot;How did you know about that?&quot; She inquired curiously 
as she glanced from one girl to another. 

Beth held out the letter to her mother, &quot;I got a letter from Star. She 
said she was returning in a couple mothers is that so?&quot; 

Jasmine dried her hands, which were wet from washing dishes, and took 
the letter from her daughter, &quot;Indeed it is true.&quot; She smiled at her 
daughter, &quot;I was going to tell you closer to their arrival. Mary-ann 
said she wanted to wait until Star&#39;s graduation before moving, but 
wanted everything set up before they moved so I have been helping out. I 
found them a nice little duplex on Pine Crescent that was just perfect 
for them.&quot; She said proud of herself, her eyes moved across the shocked 
faces of the girl&#39;s before her, 

&quot;What about her father?&quot; Beth inquired worriedly, &quot;Is he really out of 
jail?&quot; 

Jasmine was startled by this news; &quot;I didn&#39;t think Mary-ann told her 
daughter about that.&quot; She said with a sigh and set the towel down, 
&quot;Mary-ann spotted the man nearby and that is why they are moving.&quot; She 
glanced down at the letter again, reading it a little more carefully 
this time, &quot;But I guess you already know that.&quot; 

&quot;Aren&#39;t the police going to do anything?&quot; Sam inquired, &quot;Can&#39;t they stop 
him?&quot; 

&quot;They are doing what they can.&quot; Jasmine explained scratching her head in 
frustration of the situation, &quot;But he hasn&#39;t done anything yet so they 
can only give him a warning and not much more. He claimed he just moved 
into the area and it was an accident that they crossed paths so there 
isn&#39;t much that can be done.&quot; 

&quot;There has to be something.&quot; Beth interjected. 

&quot;Alright you three, what is up?&quot; She inquired curiously, &quot;You can&#39;t lie 
to me so don&#39;t try it. Why are you all so interested in Star and her 
father all of a sudden? I noticed the photo albums have been moved a lot 
recently, but I thought it was just Bethany,&quot; She always called the 
girl&#39;s by their full names, &quot;showing Trisha her photos, but now I&#39;m 
starting to wonder.&quot; 

Beth took a deep breath and glanced over at Sam, &quot;Sam?&quot; She inquired of 
the girl. 

Sam shrugged. She could not tell Diana about what was going on, but 
Beth&#39;s mother was another psychic so maybe the woman could help in some 
way. She licked her lips nervously and let out a long breath before 
speaking, &quot;I saw something about Star and I&#39;m afraid for her life.&quot; 

Beth&#39;s mother smiled brightly, &quot;I knew you were one of us the moment I 
set eyes upon you. You have such a strong aura and such a kind heart, 
but you do realize that not all prolific dreams come true right?&quot; 

Sam nervously danced in her place, &quot;It wasn&#39;t a prolific dream...&quot; She 
started to say when Beth jump in. 

&quot;Mom, this is much more complicated then prolific dreams.&quot; Beth stated 
urgently and quickly explained the entire situation in words that her 
mother could understand, using every bit of psychic terminology that she 
could muster, not allowing room for her mother to interrupt. Her 
mother&#39;s eyes widened with every passing minute that her daughter spoke, 
her hands moving to her mouth in shock as Beth told her everything from 
Sam being hit over the head by her mother to her cousins demise, in as 
much detail as she could muster without distressing Samantha too much. 
Only when she was finished the story did she give her mother room to 
speak, however the woman only stood there in stunned silence slowly 
shaking her head and staring at Sam with a bewildered look upon her 
face. Suddenly she pushed passed her daughter and dropped to her knees 
in front of Sam, her hands landing upon Sam&#39;s shoulders, tears in her 
eyes. 

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; She whispered softly, &quot;No child should have to 
experience something like that so soon after developing their gift... It 
is just... just...&quot; She could not finish her words and simply pulled Sam 
into her arms and held her tight and hugged her. 

Sam&#39;s mind instantly became a flutter of images of Beth&#39;s mother through 
the years, images of a child being pushed to the ground and having rocks 
thrown at her to her running through the streets with a child in her 
arms. Sam had to pull away from the woman, staggering from the surge of 
emotions that filled her and nearly falling to the ground. 

Beth quickly stepped in beside the girl and helped her to a beanbag 
chair, her eyes angry upon her mother, &quot;What the hell did you do to 
her?&quot; 

Her mother seemed shocked and confused, &quot;I just wanted to give her a hug 
to let her know she is welcome here.&quot; 

Sam waved a hand at her friend, &quot;It... is... alright...&quot; She panted as 
she tried hard to shake the feelings from her, &quot;I just wasn&#39;t ready for 
that.&quot; 

Beth stood to her feet and glared at her mother, &quot;Sam is very powerful 
and when she is near an extremely emotional source she is like a sponge. 
You have to be more careful around her. I thought you would know that.&quot; 
She shook her head in disbelief of her mother&#39;s actions. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; The woman sat upon a dinning chair next to the door to the 
kitchen and rubbed her forehead, glancing around sheepishly at the 
girls; &quot;I just get so emotional when I see a child in need that I 
sometimes forget.&quot; She stated sheepishly. 

Beth rubbed her forehead, &quot;Sometimes I wonder about you mother.&quot; She 
said in distain. 

Trish suddenly stepped forward, &quot;So what do we do now? We know she will 
be moving in to Sam&#39;s old place so do we tell them now or what?&quot; 

Beth&#39;s mother shook her head, &quot;If I understand fully what Sam 
experienced we are walking on thin glass and we have to be very careful 
how we handle this.&quot; She explained worriedly. 

&quot;Can we call the police?&quot; Trish inquired anxiously, &quot;They will believe 
you over us, won&#39;t they?&quot; She almost begged. 

Beth&#39;s mother gave a weak smile to the girl, &quot;I wish they would, but it 
is not that easy. I&#39;ve tried to warn them about danger before, but they 
just laughed.&quot; She thought for a moment and then looked around as if she 
had an idea, &quot;I know...&quot; Without finishing her sentence she got up from 
her seat and went to her room, leaving the girls to glance at each other 
in confusion. When she returned she was holding a small photo, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know why I kept this, but maybe it will come in handy.&quot; She handed the 
photo to Beth who stared at it perplexedly, &quot;It is Star&#39;s father.&quot; She 
stated in distaste and the girl&#39;s all let out a breath of shock, each 
trying to get a good look at the photo in Beth&#39;s hands. The man looked 
like nothing special. He was a thin man with a long drawn out expression 
upon his face. He eyes were small behind a pair of black-rimmed glasses. 
His hair was thin and black, parted neatly upon his head and he wore a 
blue business suit. 

Sam starred at the photo and recalled the silhouette of the man that 
shot her friend, &quot;That&#39;s him.&quot; She muttered in anger and fear. 

Beth glanced up from the photo, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; She asked, holding the 
photo closer to Sam, &quot;This is who you saw?&quot; 

Sam nodded, &quot;I&#39;m almost certain of it, I only saw his shadow, but I 
think it was him.&quot; She said hesitantly.

&quot;Take the photo in your hands.&quot; Beth&#39;s mother insisted, &quot;If he really is 
the one who murdered my sister and niece we must be absolutely sure of 
it. Since you have such a connection with the events ahead maybe you 
will see something that will help us track him down.&quot; 

Beth pulled the photo away from Sam and looked at her mother. &quot;Is that 
such a good idea, mom?&quot; She inquired worriedly, &quot;I haven&#39;t had time to 
teach Sam how to object read and it could be more then she can handle.&quot; 

The woman nodded, &quot;Let Sam decide for herself. She will have to learn 
clairvoyance soon enough.&quot; She turned to Sam, &quot;What do you think?&quot; 

Sam swallowed hard as she looked at the photo, over the past while she 
only gained a small glimpse of things when she picked up an object 
belonging to someone else. For the most part it was blurry and only a 
quick flash so nothing to worry about much and she figured that touching 
the photo might be a good idea. Maybe she would get a fleeting image of 
where the man was and they could stop him before he could hurt Star, &quot;I 
want to save Star.&quot; She insisted while reaching out for the photo. 

Beth seemed reluctant to give the girl the photo, &quot;You sure this is a 
good idea?&quot; She inquired uneasily, but when she saw the insistence in 
Sam&#39;s eyes she knew there was no arguing with the girls and handed the 
photo over. 

The moment Sam&#39;s fingers folded around the photo her eye suddenly 
blurred and she had a sensation of floating. Suddenly she became aware 
of someone else and she looked around to find herself in a small field, 
standing beside a tree. Her breathing was coming out sporadically, as if 
she had just run a great distance and she could feel the bark of the 
tree under her fingertips. 

Within moments Sam realized that she somehow was seeing through Star&#39;s 
father&#39;s eyes, if it was the present or the future she was not certain, 
but it was clear that the man was trying to hide from something and she 
could feel anxiety fill her, along with the feeling of sweat upon her 
brow and her heart pounding out of control. Then she saw her, Star was 
walking along a path to her right, schoolbooks in hand as she quickly 
moved on her way, looking no younger or older then she remembered the 
girl telling Sam that this must be the present or close to it. The man 
ducked behind the tree and Sam lost track of the girl, only too see her 
again through the branches of the tree. He watched her for a moment and 
Sam could sense fear overcoming the man just at the sight of the girl. 
His hand slipped into his pocket and brushed against something cold and 
solid, wrapping around it and looking down at a bunt end of a pistol. 

((NOOOOO!!!))) Sam screamed out and shoved at the man, wanting nothing 
more then to hit him, but instead she shoved too hard and pushed herself 
out of the man&#39;s body. Seconds later she found herself laying upon the 
floor of Beth&#39;s living room, a scream upon her lips and she sat bolt 
right up. 

&quot;What did you see?&quot; Beth probed nervously, helping the girl to a beanbag 
chair. 

Sam found it hard to breath as she gasped for air, she could still feel 
the grip of the gun in her hand and the sweat upon her forehead and 
wiped that, her fingers stopping on the bullet scar and running around 
it surface as anger filled her heart. 

Beth&#39;s mother rushed over to the girl with a glass of water,  &quot;Here 
drink this.&quot; She insisted, holding the glass out to the girl. 

Sam took the drink gratefully and whispered a thank you before downing 
half the glass. 

Trish worriedly approached the girl, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She inquired, 
watching her friend carefully. 

Sam nodded, &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting that at all.&quot; She said between pants, 
taking another drink of water, a small sip this time. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Beth asked again. 

Sam glanced up at her friend, fear in her eyes, &quot;He is watching her... 
he is watching Star...&quot; She said between breaths and then looked up at 
her friends, &quot;And he has a gun.&quot; 

*****

The night grew close as they sat around Beth&#39;s apartment, thinking over 
their options. Jasmine mother called up Diana to explain that the girl&#39;s 
were staying over for dinner and maybe overnight, then ordered Chinese 
food for them all. They sat around the small square fold up dinning 
table in the corner, near the kitchen, talking over how they were going 
to stop this tragedy from happening.

&quot;Well, we know that they are safe until September, at the very least.&quot;  
Jasmine said as she scooped out some rice onto her plate. 

&quot;That is what we figured.&quot; Beth stated then took a bite of a fried 
chicken leg and swallowed, &quot;But what are we supposed to do on the 
eighteenth?&quot; 

Jasmine thought for a moment, &quot;We can&#39;t warn Star or Mary-ann that is 
for sure. If we tell them then they will simply run away again and we&#39;ll 
never catch that bastard.&quot; The woman covered her mouth in embarrassment, 
&quot;Sorry girl.&quot; She apologized for her language. 

Trish laughed, &quot;We have heard worse then that at school.&quot; She stated 
with a giggle. 

Sam sighed, &quot;Yeah, between Lisa and her friends I&#39;ve heard almost every 
insult I can.&quot; She stated miserably. 

Jasmine looked between the girls with worried eyes, &quot;Are the kids at 
school bothering you girls?&quot; 

Beth shrugged, &quot;Nothing we can&#39;t handle.&quot; She insisted, &quot;Just one of our 
old friends not taking to well to Trish and my relationship.&quot; 

Jasmine eyed the girl&#39;s closely, &quot;You sure there is nothing I can do to 
help? I can come down there and give them all the &#39;Evil Eye&#39; for you.&quot; 
She said with a broad grin that made the girl&#39;s laugh. After a moment of 
laughter her face turned serious again, &quot;We really need to come up with 
a plan. We can&#39;t take this guy on head on and since the police won&#39;t 
help, so we are pretty much on our own.&quot; 

Beth starred at her mother in shock, &quot;Does this mean you are going to 
help us?&quot; She inquired in amazement. 

Jasmine nodded, &quot;I can&#39;t allow my only daughter and future 
daughter-in-law to go up again this mad man alone, now can I?&quot; 

Trish and Beth flushed brightly, &quot;Mother!?!&quot; Beth exclaimed, &quot;We aren&#39;t 
engaged!&quot; She said in a panicked state, glancing to Trish every now and 
then. 

Jasmine smiled, &quot;I know, but the two of you look so cute together that 
you can&#39;t blame a mother for hoping.&quot; She turned to Sam, &quot;Speaking of 
which, what are your plans with my niece when all of this is over?&quot; 

Sam chocked on a mouthful of rice and reached for a glass of pop, 
washing it down quickly. 

&quot;Mother!!!&quot; Beth shot across the table at the woman, &quot;Well you stop it.&quot; 

Jasmine returned her daughter&#39;s gaze, &quot;I have a right to know, Star is 
my sister&#39;s child and my god child after all.&quot; 

Sam swallowed hard, trying to cover her blush behind a napkin, &quot;I...&quot; 
She tried to find her words, but felt too flustered to speak and took a 
moment to compose herself, &quot;I don&#39;t know what will happen.&quot; She admitted 
shyly, &quot;I&#39;m just hoping we can be friends for now.&quot; 

Jasmine nodded slowly, &quot;That is good, she needs some friends. From what 
I hear she will be attending your school next year so I want the three 
of you to watch over her.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT?!?&quot; All three exclaimed at once.
