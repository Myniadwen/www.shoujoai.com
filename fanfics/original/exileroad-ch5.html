<a href="../original/exileroad-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>	        Elise found herself awakening in an
uncomfortable position, still wearing the simple black
dress she used for work. &#39;Where?&#39; she thought dazedly,
the little redhead looking around before her eyes
widened in alarm.

        The tall black haired stranger stood quietly
talking with m&#39;lady, her black leather garb and
fearsome battle staff marking her as some sort of
lawless ruffian. The woman who was clearly her partner
in crime stood nearby, the tawny haired lady armed
with knives and who knows what else concealed beneath
her uniform.

        &quot;Duchess,&quot; Elise forced herself to rise,
tensing herself to try to save m&#39;lady... somehow.

        Jantha turned to walk over to her side, the
expression on the delicate blonde shifting from
concern to relief. &quot;It&#39;s all right Elise,&quot; she said to
her softly before shooting an irritable look at the
other two women, &quot;these are my new bodyguards.&quot;

        &quot;Bodyguards?&quot; Elise echoed, feeling a bit
sheepish as she shook her head to try and clear it.
She remembered their entrance, her startlement... then
darkness as she fainted. &quot;How did I get...?&quot; she
trailed off, moving to get up off the couch she had
been set down on.

        The tallest woman smiled, the gentle
expression making her seem much less fearsome. &quot;I
carried you over,&quot; she shrugged.

        &quot;That is Midori,&quot; Jantha nodded to her then
looked at the other, &quot;and that&#39;s Laur&#39;ien.&quot; She puffed
out a sigh, &quot;It seems they&#39;ll be staying awhile.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Elise gave Midori a shy smile.

        &quot;Do you greet all new arrivals that way?&quot;
Laur&#39;ien smirked.

        Elise felt her cheeks going red as her back
stiffened. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she ignored the young woman to
look at Jantha, &quot;there are duties I must attend to,
rooms need to be prepared.&quot; With that she strode from
the room, her red braid bouncing against her back.

        &quot;What?&quot; Laur&#39;ien asked as Jantha glared at
her.

        &quot;She is my trusted friend as well as my
servant,&quot; Jantha finally said to her frostily, &quot;and I
do not care to see her so mistreated.&quot;

        Laur&#39;ien winced, &quot;Sorry.&quot; She moved towards
the door Elise had just walked out of, &quot;I&#39;ll find her,
apologize if you want....&quot;

        &quot;Na,&quot; Midori shook her head with a sigh,
&quot;she&#39;s upset, I doubt she&#39;d hear the apology anyway.
Give &#39;er some time, then try it.&quot;

        &quot;I suspect Midori is right,&quot; Jantha agreed
seriously. She pushed back her blonde hair with a
weary sigh, &quot;I must refresh myself, it&#39;s been a long
day.&quot;

        &quot;Lead the way,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said, moving to stand
by her side.

        Jantha shot her a look, &quot;You can not be
serious.&quot;

        Midori surprised her by speaking up, &quot;We still
don&#39;t really know who wants you dead or what resources
they can call on, Duchess.&quot; A slightly grim smile as
she continued, &quot;It&#39;s little enough for one of us to
accompany you at all times.&quot;

        &quot;What did I do to deserve this?&quot; Jantha threw
her hands up in the air.

        &#39;That&#39;s what I want to know,&#39; Midori thought
but she kept any trace of her thoughts from showing on
her face. &quot;One of us should come along,&quot; she offered.

        Laur&#39;ien grinned as she offered, &quot;Why, we
could even wash your back for you.&quot;

        Jantha visibly gritted her teeth. &quot;Midori,
you&#39;re with me. Laur&#39;ien,&quot; she paused a moment, &quot;just
try to stay out of trouble.&quot;

        &quot;Have fun,&quot; Laur&#39;ien sat on the couch casually
as Midori followed the Duchess out of the living room
and into the hallway.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Midori asked her softly
as they walked on.

        &quot;That woman is so... foolish,&quot; Jantha scowled
as she gestured, &quot;I cannot believe she is an officer
of the crown!&quot;

        Midori fought back a smile as they headed to
the back of the house. &quot;I suspect that she does some
of the less noble work for Commander Hudson,&quot; she
suggested, &quot;the kind of duties where a polite manner
doesn&#39;t usually matter.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Jantha murmured softly, &quot;I hadn&#39;t
considered that.&quot;

        They entered the home&#39;s bath hall, a large
room with tiles lining the floor. A great bath was set
to one side of the room, the tub at least a man&#39;s
height long and wide, piping leading out from taps
that were likely connected to some large boiler. There
was a delicate sent of fine soaps in the air, along
with precious oils and fragrances.

        Jantha calmly untied the laces of her top,
shrugging her shoulders slightly to loosen the cloth.
As bare shoulders appeared Midori watched with frank
interest, noting the ripple of muscle, &#39;She&#39;s in
better shape than I thought.&#39;

        &quot;You could at least turn your back,&quot; Jantha&#39;s
cheeks were faintly red as the dress dropped to the
floor, her white corset and underthings binding the
shapely body beneath.

        &quot;We are both women here,&quot; Midori offered but
turned around to keep an eye on the only window,
watching for any signs of movement outside. Behind her
she heard cloth rustle, bindings being undone and
material gently sliding to the floor. A soft splash
and a happy sigh signaled Midori to ask, &quot;Are you in
yet?&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; Jantha offered, the younger woman
neck deep in the steaming water, suds floating over
the surface. She grabbed a sponge from beside the bath
as Midori turned back towards her, scrubbing at her
arm vigorously.

        Midori sat on a wooden stool by the bath, her
eyes warily scanning even as she said, &quot;I thought that
most people used public baths?&quot;

        &quot;They do,&quot; Jantha agreed, &quot;this is one of my
many indulgences, honestly.&quot; She lifted a long leg and
used the sponge to scrub once she finished her arms,
&quot;Is it the same in your homeland?&quot;

        &quot;Public baths as well,&quot; Midori agreed, &quot;though
the custom is slightly different. First the body is
scrubbed clean and rinsed, only then do you climb into
the bath itself.&quot;

        &quot;Interesting,&quot; Jantha said as she moved to set
the sponge down, grabbing a washcloth and moving to
clean downwards from her shoulders. She smiled
slightly, noting Midori&#39;s gaze on her breasts, &quot;See
something interesting?&quot;

        Midori flushed, looking away as she admitted,
&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m still getting used to
seeing people so generously endowed.&quot;

        Jantha had to chuckle softly at that as she
smoothly turned around in the tub. &quot;I hate to do
anything Laur&#39;ien might suggest,&quot; she said as she
presented her bare back to Midori, &quot;but could you
please wash my back for me?&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Midori took the sponge to
delicately make circles on the other woman&#39;s skin,
noting with some amusement how she arched her back
like a cat.

        Meanwhile, Laur&#39;ien had already finished
sharpening all her knives and was growing bored
sitting out on the living room couch. &quot;Might as well
take a look around,&quot; she finally decided, the rangy
blonde getting up. She paused, &quot;But there&#39;s that
irritated maid to contend with....&quot;

        Laur&#39;ien stood thinking for a moment, then a
impish little smile appeared on her cute face.
Smoothly she stripped, folding up her clothes and
setting the pants, shirt and black boots on the little
table there. The woman&#39;s body carried with it the
marks of war, a series of thin, white scars that
crisscrossed her bare form.

        &quot;Now let&#39;s see,&quot; Laur&#39;ien murmured, &#39;what
should I....&quot; Her body seemed to melt, shrinking down
as it flowed into another shape, quickly solidifying
into another form. The golden furred cat stretched out
it&#39;s body, tail swishing as it smoothly padded over to
the door.

        The cat moved down the hall, following scents
as it curiously ambled around the first floor. The
baths in the rear tempted her but Laur&#39;ien decided to
let the others alone for now, instead soon finding the
kitchen. The maid Elise worked with two other women,
both seeming normal to the little cat&#39;s now enhanced
senses.

        &quot;Oh,&quot; Elise looked down at Laur&#39;ien in
surprise, &quot;how did you get in here?&quot;

        &quot;Meorw,&quot; Laur&#39;ien answered, batting cutely at
a finger that the maid extended to her.

        &quot;It&#39;s adorable,&quot; the black haired girl gushed,
her bosom bouncing as she moved.

        &quot;Can we keep it?&quot; the little brunette asked,
reaching out to scratch behind the ears.

        &quot;Lisa, Chris,&quot; Elise laughed, &quot;we don&#39;t even
know if it wants to stay.&quot;

        &#39;Hmm,&#39; Laur&#39;ien thought as she was stroked,
watching the three women through eyes slitted with
pleasure, &#39;I think I&#39;ll be sticking around.&#39;</pre>
