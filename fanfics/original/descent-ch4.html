<a href="../original/descent-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The brown haired young woman sighed softly in relief as she walked 
through the doors of the church, feeling safe for the first time that 
day. After taking a cautious look around the priest made her way up 
the central aisle to the altar itself, the black clad figure kneeling 
down there for a moment to pray, her voice soft in the large room.


A few minutes later a young woman came out from the back, her nun&#39;s 
garb making her look oddly like a penguin. She gracefully made her 
way over to where the priest rose to her feet, and they exchanged a 
nod. &quot; Samantha Teresa,&quot; the nun nodded to the priest.


&quot;And you&#39;re Katherine, right?&quot; Sam nodded back. &quot;Call me Sam,&quot; she 
added.


&quot;Sam, then,&quot; Katherine smiled gently.


The priest smiled to herself as she took another look around the 
otherwise deserted church. &quot;So what does the church want with a 
Knight of the Temple?&quot; Sam asked.


&quot;Officially, we don&#39;t even admit that you actually exist,&quot; Katherine 
said with a little smile as they moved over to one of the nearby 
benches. They sat down together, and the nun was struck once again by 
how handsome Sam was.


&quot;Unofficially, then,&quot; Sam smiled back at her gently, making herself 
look even more boyishly handsome, if that was possible. Politely she 
asked, &quot;I assume it&#39;s the sort of work that we&#39;re usually called on 
to handle?&quot;


&quot;Yes,&quot; Katherine sighed softly, a bit of her long blonde hair 
escaping to curl delicately against her pale cheek. &quot;There are 
reports of a demon establishing a territory for itself over in the 
red light district,&quot; she explained to Sam grimly.


&quot;That&#39;s in the Lady Diana&#39;s territory,&quot; Sam calmly noted, &quot;is the 
demon some new muscle that was called up for her?&quot;


&quot;No, it doesn&#39;t seem so,&quot; Katherine shook her head. &quot;In fact, the 
demon seems to be driving Diana&#39;s people out of the area,&quot; she added.


&quot;Probably a gang war,&quot; Sam mused, &quot;another faction having called up 
something in hopes of beating Diana&#39;s forces.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;m 
almost tempted to let it run loose for awhile.&quot;


&quot;Lead us not into temptation,&quot; Katherine quoted softly.


&quot;Hmm,&quot; Sam nodded slightly. Her expression was grave as she said, &quot;If 
this really is a demon, I&#39;ll need something special to deal with it.&quot;


&quot;That&#39;s already covered,&quot; Katherine said softly. From beneath her 
black clothes she drew out a metallic box, handing it over. As Sam 
opened it up to examine the rows of silvery bullets nestled within 
she explained, &quot;A silver cross was melted down to make the alloy, and 
they were all blessed by a team of priests.&quot;


&quot;That should do it,&quot; Sam slid the case into her own black coat. She 
rose, her expression becoming all business, &quot;I&#39;ll need media 
containment ready, in case this goes public.&quot;


&quot;A gang-war scenario has already been circulated with the media to 
cover this demon&#39;s activities,&quot; Katherine quietly said, &quot;we can use 
that to cover your activities.&quot;


&quot;Good,&quot; Sam turned to walk down the aisle towards the doors, &quot;I&#39;ll 
report back as soon as there&#39;s any progress.&quot; She paused in the 
doorway to add, &quot;God be with you.&quot;


&quot;God be with you,&quot; Katherine echoed as Sam disappeared out into the 
night. She stood there rigidly for a few moments, then slumped 
against one of the benches. &quot;God, I wanted her,&quot; she hissed out, her 
breath coming more rapidly.


&quot;Very well done, little one,&quot; another nun came out from the back of 
the church. Her own garb was badly rumpled, her large breasts 
thrusting up against the fabric. &quot;I don&#39;t think she suspected a 
thing,&quot; the woman murmured, stroking Katherine&#39;s cheek.


&quot;Oh, Mistress Selene,&quot; the girl shuddered. Katherine gasped as the 
taller nun pulled her into a kiss, dominating the slim young beauty.


&quot;Go into the back with the others,&quot; Selene slapped Katherine&#39;s 
bottom, sending her staggering off, &quot;I&#39;ll be back to join you 
shortly.&quot;


She watched Katherine walk off, her hips swaying as the slim girl 
stripped her outer garb off, revealing the leather that she wore 
beneath. Selene waited until she was gone before pulling a phone from 
her pocket and dialing the number from memory.


&quot;Yes?&quot; Grace&#39;s voice came through clearly, and Selene could easily 
imagine the dark haired secretary kneeling submissively in the 
opulent office.


&quot;The weapon is aimed,&quot; Selene calmly reported. The redhead smiled 
coldly, &quot;We should be hearing all about it in the news before too 
long.&quot;


&quot;Good work,&quot; Grace answered warmly, &quot;it&#39;s always good to do business 
with you.&quot; She paused to ask, &quot;And what of the nuns there?&quot;


&quot;They all fell under my influence remarkably easily,&quot; Selene actually 
sounded just a bit disappointed, &quot;I seduced my first one only days 
after I &#39;transferred&#39; here.&quot; A slow smile, &quot;They&#39;ll be firmly under 
your Lady&#39;s thumb for good once I&#39;m done with them.&quot;


&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; Grace signed off with that.


Selene put the phone away, smiling to herself as she considered what 
she was going to be doing next. Most people thought that succumbing 
to darkness was a consciously made choice, but they&#39;d be wrong. With 
the nuns she had gently lured them forward, step by step into the 
deeper shadows, each act a seemingly innocent one. A harmless little 
lie, a secretly satisfied lust, and a forbidden pleasure later and 
then they were all hers.


As she pushed the door to the back room there was the scent of sexual 
musk in the air, and Selene smiled. She looked down at the three 
girls who laying there in a pile of pale, tangled limbs, her own 
breath coming a bit faster. One of the girls twisted about wildly as 
another worshipped her round breasts, gasping her pleasure. The girl 
teasing those breasts moaned and twisted as a third girl knelt 
between her wide spread legs.


&quot;Too easy,&quot; Selene muttered, moving in behind the third girl...




In another part of the city, a young woman looked around the 
apartment with an expression of pure disdain. Her face was oddly 
angular, her long, pitch black hair flowing over her shoulders, the 
normally eerie eyes concealed behind a pair of sunglasses.


&quot;So do the roaches have to pay a share of the rent, too?&quot; Descent 
asked the man who was standing there beside her dryly.


The landlord actually snorted with laughter before he recovered 
himself. &quot;No, they don&#39;t,&quot; he smiled wryly, &quot;but it is in your 
budget, Miss...&quot;


&quot;Anne,&quot; she shot back, using the alias she had adopted.


&quot;And you wanted a place in this district,&quot; he continued. He shook his 
head, &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure you could find a better place away from here.&quot;


&quot;I need to be here,&quot; Descent said firmly, shutting him up. She looked 
around the place again before declaring, &quot;I&#39;ll take it, now.&quot;


&quot;Do you want me to get the exterminators in, at least?&quot; the landlord 
asked, his eyes widening as she paid two months rent in advance, all 
in cash.


&quot;I&#39;ll deal with it,&quot; Descent&#39;s voice was ice cold.


&quot;Right, right&quot; he turned around and got out of the top floor room as 
quickly as possible. Almost running down the dingy stairway the man 
found himself wondering just what sort of person that he had just 
rented out a suite to.


Descent looked around the bug infested hovel and took of her glasses, 
revealing her unearthly eyes. The skittering noises stopped, then the 
woman&#39;s eyes began to glow as she summoned up her essence. The sound 
of rapid scampering could be heard, this time as far away from the 
suite as the bugs could get. Whatever Descent was, they didn&#39;t want 
any part of it.


&quot;That should do it,&quot; Descent muttered, walking over towards a grimy 
window. She looked out at the street, at the people down there, and 
wondered for a moment if she could really do this.


After intercepting that first shipment, Descent had kept her eyes 
open, and what she found shocked her. The amount of drugs and money 
passing through this town was terrible, and the other things she 
stumbled across had shaken her even more, Human smuggling, 
prostitution, slavery, child porn, all of it was going down here.


Or it was, anyway.


But each operation that she shut down seemed to lead to two more. And 
all the evil that was going on there seemed to have one thing in 
common: the name Diana. Called Lady Diana, the Lady, or other names, 
she seemed to be in command of the criminals in this part of town. 
And Descent wasn&#39;t any closer to finding out any more about her.


Part of Descent&#39;s decision to adopt a more normal apartment had been 
to try to keep a closer eye on the people out here, to see what they 
saw. And, she had to admit, to give her a place to rest occasionally. 
Sleeping on rooftops and in doorways didn&#39;t always work out too well, 
at least to anyone who tried to interfere with her.


&quot;Hopefully this will work out,&quot; Descent muttered to herself softly.
