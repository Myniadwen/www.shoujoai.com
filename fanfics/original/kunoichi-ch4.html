~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

It was getting late.

Yui looked upwards into the starry night sky. It was such a 
beautiful night tonight. Not a cloud in the sky. All the lights 
from the surrounding houses had been shut off; so nothing out 
there could blot out the images of the twinkling jewel stars 
that adorned the night. Yui didn&#39;t take much time out to 
appreciate them these days. She always had more important things 
to think about and obsess over. But today; she was just 
feeling... good about things. Aside from the battle with Zanmaru 
at Kimagure Gakuen, school had been really good for her first 
day. And she had already made a new friend. Someone that Yui 
really liked. Someone that Yui really, *really* liked. 

Uchida Haruko. 

It was about 8.15 right now. School finished more than five 
hours ago. But rather than go straight to newly-furnished by 
lonely apartment; Yui had been invited to the Uchida House by 
Haruko herself. Yui had cheerfully agreed to this and left with 
her. They stopped at a local arcade first however. Just to 
lounge around and get something to drink before they ventured to 
Haruko&#39;s house. Once they left the arcade and actually got to 
Haruko&#39;s house; she was introduced to the rest of Haruko&#39;s 
Family. Mother Uchida and Father Uchida. Hibuki (who was out at 
the time) she had already met, back in school. They were all 
very nice people, and in a way, much like Haruko. They had deep 
interests in Politics and were staunchly opposed to the 
leadership of Japan&#39;s current Prime Minister, Fujiwara. Yui was 
astounded by this. Not many people noticed how incompetent he 
truly was. It showed that the Uchida household was clearly 
modern in their approach to Japanese political life. And was 
probably one of the reasons why Haruko was so determined to work 
her way into parliament. The four of them sat down to an evening 
meal; just a little sukiyaki. It was getting colder and colder 
these days, so Mother Uchida had been cooking more Winter Foods 
for her family. Which was a pleasant surprise for Yui herself. 
She had loved home cooked meals back home in Morioka. Her 
parents (old as they were) did a lot for her in the kitchen when 
it came to that. And Yui couldn&#39;t help but ask Mother Uchida how 
she cooked it. Yui&#39;s cooking skills were below her own 
acceptable standards but she was always willing to learn. 
Besides. The modern Tokyo-girl must apparently know how to steer 
a way between both home-skills and a professional career. In 
some ways Yui was lacking in both.

By the time that Yui was aware of the falling darkness; a few 
hours had rolled by. It was time to be getting home; and Yui 
didn&#39;t want to impose on the gracious Uchida Family (even though 
Haruko had assured her that she was doing no such thing). Right 
now Yui strolled out of the Uchida Household, looking up into 
the night sky briefly. She fixed her winter jacket on, and then 
secured her grip on her school bag. Haruko walked up behind her 
as they went to the front of the doorway. Yui turned around and 
faced her new friend, her head tilting to one side of her 
shoulders, smiling.

&quot;Thanks for everything, Haruko-san,&quot; Yui offered, &quot;I really 
enjoyed spending the day with you and meeting your family. Your 
folks are very nice.&quot;

Haruko waved her off. &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to say that. They have 
their moments. Besides, I was glad to do it. I am class rep 
after all. Plus, it&#39;s not easy going to a new school and meeting 
new people. Especially when they all know each other.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Yui nodded, &quot;... So... um... do you wanna... walk to 
school together tomorrow...?&quot;

The youngest member of the Uchida Family nodded with a small and 
uncharacteristically shy little smile.  &quot;Sure. I&#39;d like that a 
lot.&quot;

That was nice. Yui was glad for that. It meant that today meant 
more to Haruko than just her duties to welcome newcomers. Which 
was worth a lot, considering the fact that Yui really saw Haruko 
as her friend now. The bashful girl strode from the Uchida 
doorway and walked out into the smooth stone of the pavement. 
She then waved her goodbyes to Haruko. Haruko waved back and 
went inside, seeing Yui off. Then Yui began her walk home. Her 
apartment wasn&#39;t too far from here but it would be a lot quicker 
by bus. Unfortunately, the last bus of the day had left about 
half and hour ago. So all Yui really could do was walk home this 
way. 

Of course, there was one way to get home quicker...

...As Shiki. 

Yui really didn&#39;t like using the magnificent shinobi powers of 
Shiki unless there was some kind of threat to her life. But it 
was pitch black out here and Yui didn&#39;t want to risk running 
into anyone here unguarded. She wasn&#39;t afraid of any thug, thief 
or rapist; just the threat of the Six Orochi she had been 
thinking about since this morning. If they were willing to send 
Zanmaru after her at a public school; they were more than likely 
to come after her again. And Yui still didn&#39;t know exactly where 
Hirotsugu was. So she couldn&#39;t quite kill the bastard yet. That 
meant coping with the Orochi until she found a route to the 
Honshu Koga himself. Still, Yui wanted to get home fast anyways. 
If she went to bed late then she would wake up late. And she 
really didn&#39;t want to upset Haruko by being late for the second 
time in two days. So it was time to unleash the hidden kunoichi 
of Morioka. Yui looked around herself for a second. Just to 
check if there was anyone nearby. 

There was no one. 
 
Yui then dashed around the corner of the chain of semi-detached 
buildings on the road. She went into a secluded corner and began 
re-assuming herself in the appropriate persona. For her fight 
with Zanmaru she had not worn her ninja clothing. Tonight would 
be no exception, those clothes had mostly been left at home. 
Besides, the Six Orochi seemed to know that she was attending 
Kimagure Gakuen anyway. It would have made very little 
difference if they did manage to spot her like this. Yui pulled 
the facial wrappings from her book bag. She spread it out evenly 
between both of her hands, and then brought it back around her 
face. The girl wrapped the elongated scarf-mask around the lower 
half of her face, tying it firmly to her head via a tight knot 
at the back of her upper neck. Once this had been done, the 
expression on Yui&#39;s face changed (even though only the upper 
half of her face could be seen). Almost by reflex, the shy and 
sensitive visage of Hazumaru Yui changed into the twisted, 
amused and virtually devious face of Shiki. Shiki chuckled to 
herself; then grabbed the book bag. She withdrew a few items 
from it this time. Things she didn&#39;t need against Zanmaru but 
took anyway. The first was her short sword, Miyuki. It was a 
bamboo sword; in that it appeared to be nothing more that a 
relatively short and thin length of bamboo. But within it was a 
keen steel that had been sharpened with knives and acids by 
Shiki herself. Sharp enough to cut through the heavens. Shiki 
attached Miyuki to the back of her schoolgirl skirt and went 
back into the book bag. The second thing she pulled out was as 
small pocket of fabric. Containing a healthy stock of shuriken. 
The fight with Zanmaru had shown that she was not the only one 
to have mastered use of them. Not by a long-shot. So it would be 
better to be fully armed while as Shiki from now on. 

The girl attached the pocket of small shuriken (20 in number) at 
one side of her leg. Better to stay on top of things while she 
travelled like this. Shiki then stood upright and gripped her 
bag firmly. Right before leaping aggressively into the night 
sky. She jumped into the air like a raven taking flight; sailing 
over the concrete streets beneath her until she landed on the 
other side of the road. From there she began a steady dash home; 
darting through the shadows and back routes of this area. This 
took about twenty minutes. It went to show that Shiki had a 
longer way to go than she first realized. But there was one 
shortcut, through a place called Ichijiteki Park. It was a large 
park full of lush greenery and towering trees. Open to the 
public during the mornings and afternoons; closed to the public 
at night. That applied to today just as it would to any other 
day. But Shiki didn&#39;t much care. She had to get home and she 
wasn&#39;t the type to hang around (at least not in this form). The 
dark kunoichi walked up to the tall painted-black gates that cut 
off Ichijiteki Park from the outside. Not much of an obstacle to 
her. Shiki grinned behind her face mask and jumped upwards. Her 
lithe and trained body went straight over that two-metre tall 
metal fence. And she collided with the dry green grass of the 
park as she came back down. Easy enough. Then she began her 
dashing pace. Shiki ran straight through the parks many 
pathways; marked off by trees and stone paths. Thankfully she 
researched this area before she moved here, so she had a rough 
idea of how everything was laid out in this district. She had 
made a particularly thorough study of Ichijiteki Park because 
she had a feeling she would be using it often. And that trouble 
would come her way at least once while walking through it. 

Shiki had no idea how right she was.

After running through the vastness of the park for about ten 
minutes; Shiki began to realize that this shouldn&#39;t be taking so 
long. She should have made it to the other side of the park by 
this point in time. It was dark but there was no way she could 
have gotten lost. Then she began to notice that there was a 
bleak fog hanging in the air. But it was no ordinary fog. It was 
misty but thick; and it was surrounding this field of the park 
very quickly. So quickly that Shiki had failed to notice it. 
Before she did something wrong; Shiki slowed down and soon 
stopped. Something wasn&#39;t right here. This fog (which was 
actually turning a sort of light reddish colour) was too thick 
to have sprung up so quickly.

Then it hit her.

&quot;Damn!&quot; She breathed heavily, &quot;...It must a shinobi 
conjuration!&quot;

Though Shiki could have had no way of knowing who or where it 
came from; a second and equally feminine voice called out to 
her. It echoed in the vastness of the park and hung in the now 
thickening air that surrounded her.

&quot;Correct!&quot; The voice yelled, harshly, &quot;A skill of Gensou-jutsu 
(Art of Illusion) that I like to call Meiro Kiri (Maze Fog). The 
more you run, the deeper you&#39;ll fall into it. You&#39;ll just keep 
marching around and around in circles until you starve to death. 
So I truly suggest that you stay put. There is absolutely no way 
to escape from me...&quot;

Shiki scowled, letting her hand fall behind her back, gripping 
the hilt of Miyuki. Her eyes stayed searching from side to side. 
The voice was well hidden. She couldn&#39;t even tell which way that 
it was coming from. 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Shiki yelled out, &quot;Are you one of the Six 
Orochi?&quot;

The young female voice chuckled in the air. &quot;Heh, heh, heh! 
Zanmaru-san and Setsuki-kun have big mouths! But no matter. You 
were bound to learn of us eventually. I am Ryoko. The very First 
of the Six Orochi. Apparently you are quite the thorn in 
Hirotsugu-sama&#39;s side. So I have come to compensate for 
Zanmaru-san&#39;s failures and kill you. Once I&#39;ve finished with 
you; I&#39;ll toss your bones into the winds... no one kills a 
member of the Six Orochi and lives to tell that tale. Prepare to 
die!&quot;

Shiki gripped Miyuki&#39;s hilt in a tight grip. &quot;Loudmouthed bitch. 
You seem pretty confident about yourself. But what makes you 
think that you won&#39;t fall to me in the same way that Zanmaru-san 
did?&quot; 

&quot;I am not alone, my dear Kunoichi,&quot; The hidden Ryoko replied, 
&quot;Let me introduce you to the lesser ninja of the Mizuryu Clan. 
I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll give you some ripe sport before you die!&quot;

Just as Ryoko finished that statement, a loud whooshing sound 
filled the air at five different points around Shiki. Five 
lesser shinobi then jumped downwards into attacking positions 
from the nothingness of that thick foggy air. Five of them, all 
armed and all out for blood, surrounding Shiki to prepare to 
attack. They were not elite ninja. So all Shiki could do was 
laugh. Dark chuckles escaped her soft fabric-enswathed lips. She 
knew that Ryoko couldn&#39;t possibly be relying on such amateurs 
right now. All she had to do was take them all out. 

The first one came swiftly. He ran straight out at Shiki, 
pulling a small knife/short sword from his back. Shiki focused 
on him and slowly eased Miyuki from its sheath. When they 
reached within striking distance of each other; Shiki drew her 
sword and sliced through the abdomen of the lesser ninja. He 
skidded behind her with a gasp. While Shiki ran forwards and 
launched an attack on someone else. The cut ninja coughed up a 
guzzle of blood; that spurted from the gaps in his facial 
wrapping. Then he released a mournful wail of a death cry as his 
thin body slid from his waist in haze of blood. The body of the 
ninja, that had been sliced in two, collapsed into a pile on the 
cold, cry grass. Shiki ignored the death of that guy and focused 
on the one she was charging. This second ninja withdrew his own 
sword and tried to slice at her in the same way. Shiki crouched 
under the attack, mid-run, then came up again and slashed with 
Miyuki in a sort of uppercut motion. The shinobi screamed as his 
ribcage was ripped open in a flash of steel and blood. Bone, 
skin, blood and putrid, ruptured guts were exposed as that ninja 
dropped dead. Shiki stopped for a second as the remaining 
shinobi encircled her. One at back, one at the front, and one to 
the left. The one at the back threw something at Shiki. She knew 
exactly what it was. The dark kunoichi jumped straight up into 
the air and backflipped over the shuriken. It then struck the 
front ninja straight in the neck. He gargled on his own blood 
and dropped choking to the grass. As Shiki rotated mid-air; she 
quickly pulled out a shuriken of her own from the pocket 
attached to her leg. She flung it at the left shinobi; straight 
at the neck. The lesser ninja coughed and gasped as it went 
straight through the nape of his neck and cut through the back 
in a smooth motion. More of that crimson red blood spurted into 
the air. And the throat-busted warrior collapsed dead in that 
instant. The last one was now terrified of this woman. But stood 
his ground. Something that Hazumaru Yui might have respected. 
But not Shiki. The kunoichi gripped Miyuki and then flipped back 
behind the remaining lesser ninja in a blur of movement. She 
thrust Miyuki&#39;s blade right into his back. The man gasped 
violently, breathlessly. He looked down at the sword as it stuck 
out of his stomach in a crude but cunning angle. His few 
remaining seconds of life vanished. And the lesser shinobi 
crumpled into a heap like the other four. 

Shiki pulled Miyuki away as the dead man slid off it. It was 
completely soiled with the blood of her kills. But before she 
even had the time to admire what she had done, those bodies soon 
reacted. The five dead shinobi laid lifelessly on the ground 
until a substantial black smoke surrounded their corpses. They 
were all enclosed by it and by the time it faded away; all those 
cleaved torsos were gone. Shiki was confused for a second; but 
then thought about it. It was another spell. One that carried 
away those dead bodies before someone could find out about them. 
Regardless, they were dead and were no match for Shiki in any 
case. The woman slashed with Miyuki in the air, to clean it of 
the blood. 

Then Shiki sensed danger again. 

Something was coming at her from behind. She speedily rotated 
her body and slashed with Miyuki again. There was a clash of 
metal. The attacking object span away from Shiki and her sword. 
Then staked the soil ground with a thump. It was a kunai. Then 
Shiki remembered that it was not over. Ryoko was still out 
there. Somewhere.

&quot;Very good!&quot; The brash Ryoko offered from the distance, &quot;Your 
power is akin to that of the dragon and your movements are as 
elegant and as swift as those of the crane. But those fools were 
just minor lackeys. You will fight me now! And you will fall...&quot;
