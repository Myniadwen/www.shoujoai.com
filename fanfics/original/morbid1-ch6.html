<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/morbid1-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Death is among us

News of Lord Greystoke and Young Lady Maria&#39;s death swept across town 
like a wild fire. Fishermen early in the morning had discovered the 
bodies caught up in their nets. Before Jamie arose the word of their 
deaths had already crossed the lips of almost everyone in town. Jamie, 
however, walked down the street unaware of the tragic end to her lover&#39;s 
life. She skipped along the edge of the cobblestone road, oblivious to 
the whispers of passers by. Her night was filled with dreams of Maria 
and plans to take the girl down to the lake later in the day for a 
picnic by the water&#39;s edge.  

&quot;Why Jamie have you heard the news?&quot; Her boss called out to the girl as 
she hopped up to the newsstand.
								
&quot;What news, sir?&quot; She asked tilting her head in curiosity. 
										
&quot;Lord Greystoke and his daughter were killed late last night.&quot; He stated 
handing the girl a new paper off the pile. 

Jamie shakily took the paper and glanced upon the headline that read, 
&quot;Great Lord and Young Lady Mourned.&quot; Her skin paled more then usual as 
she skimmed the article in disbelief, &quot;H... how... how is this 
possible?&quot; She felt dizzy and faint, &quot;I just... saw them last night...&quot; 
She explained licking her lips nervously. 

&quot;Are you Jamie Eadwolf?&quot; A voice demanded from behind the girl. 

Jamie turned around to find two police officers standing before her, 
&quot;Y...yes... sir...&quot; She answered in a thin small voice. 

&quot;Will you come with us?&quot; One of the officers offered a hand to the girl. 

Jamie starred at the hand in confusion. Her mind was muddled and having 
trouble comprehending what was going on. Her boss stepped forward, &quot;Now 
see here. Jamie is just a young lad. What is this about?&quot;

&quot;This lad was the last to see the Greystoke family alive.&quot; One of the 
officers explained, &quot;We just want a word with him to see if he knows who 
could have wanted to kill them.&quot; He assured the shopkeeper. 

Jamie knees suddenly gave way and she clenched at her stomach as she 
felt like she was about to throw up, &quot;This can&#39;t be happening.&quot; Tears 
over filled her eyes, &quot;They can&#39;t be dead. She can&#39;t...&quot; She let out a 
deep sob as grief set in, uncaring of the stares she received from the 
many onlookers. 

At the other side of the stand old lady Olaf gleefully read the 
headline, then gazed up at the dark clouds that were forming overhead. 
Things were going just as she perceived. 

*****

Unbeknownst to Jamie, Professor Clara Greystoke also had Maria on her 
mind that gloomy morning. Clara paced apprehensively in the main hall of 
the castle. She was almost certain that it must have been one of the 
servants that had taken her family from her in such a grim manner. She 
had fired all but a very few of the servants, leaving only those chosen 
few that she trusted. The rest were told to leave and never come back 
again. The silence of the empty castle was beginning to get to her when 
she heard a knocking at the door. She rushed to the door and opened it 
quickly.

&quot;Evening Professor Greystoke.&quot; A tired old man said as he took a flat 
brown hat off his balding head and bowed.

&quot;Ah! Mr. Coch, you are just on time.&quot; Clara opened the door fully and 
ushered the man into out of the cold air, &quot;Come right in.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you ma&#39;am.&quot; Ernest said with an appreciative smile, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry to hear of your loss. Your letter did say it was urgent so I 
rushed right on over.&quot; He anxiously crumbled up his hat in his hands as 
he spoke and his eyes wandered the illustrious main hall. Ernest F. Coch 
was a caretaker for the town&#39;s cemeteries and he had come across rough 
times in the grave digging business, as such he put his services up for 
bid and for the right price he was willing to do just about anything. As 
long as it had to do with cemeteries, that is. 

&quot;Yes, I did.&quot; Clara nodded in appreciation of the gravediggers hasty 
arrival, &quot;I have contracted some men to help me build a new extension to 
the west wing.&quot; She began to say.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, ma&#39;am.&quot; Ernest interrupted and scratching the back of his 
head, &quot;I ain&#39;t no good with tools other then a shovel.&quot; He explained 
modestly

&quot;Which is why I called for you.&quot; Clara stated trying hard not to get 
irritated with the man, &quot;I have a job for you and will pay you dearly 
for it. You have keys to the dead house, do you not?&quot; She inquired 
eagerly.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; Ernest gave the woman a peculiar look. The dead house was 
where they kept the dead before they were to be buried. One of Ernest&#39;s 
jobs was attending to the dead before burial, sizing them up so the plot 
was large enough to hold the body, &quot;What would you want with that 
place?&quot; He asked with much interest. 

*****

It was midafternoon before Jamie was release from the police house and 
she felt exhausted from all the interrogation. Again she glanced down at 
the paper to read the headline, as she had several times before during 
the interview. She already memorized every word of the article and 
glancing at it made tears brim in the corners of her eyes once again. 
She wiped at the tears in a vain attempt to conceal the pain she was 
feeling inside.

Mournfully she turned away from the police house to start the long trek 
back to The Raven&#39;s Keep and her bed. She stuffed the newspaper into her 
bag and jammed her hands into her pockets, keeping her head low as so no 
one could get a look at her red swollen eyes. She could feel the eyes of 
every person on the street crawling over her. Several people tried to 
give Jamie their condolence as she passed on by. It would seem that 
rumours of her involvement with Lady Marie had spread quickly and 
several of the aristocrats turned their noses up at the girl while 
friends bid her a kind word. She ignored all of this as she travelled 
the winding streets of town. Not so much as giving a sideways glance 
until she came across a little bookshop. She had been inside the store 
many a time over the years in search of inspiration in the many books 
that lined the wall, however this time it felt as if there was something 
behind the window display that was calling her. Her eyes fell upon a 
small red book with no title upon its cover. Something about the book 
intrigued her curiosity and she entered the shop to learn more. 

An old storekeeper smiled upon setting his eyes on Jamie. He looked 
around to see that the store was empty before he spoke, &quot;Why hello, 
young lady. Been some time since I last saw the likes of you around 
here.&quot; The shopkeeper greeted the girl with a gleeful smile and a nod, 
&quot;What can I do for you on this gloomy day?&quot; He asked, noticing the way 
the girl kept her eyes on the front display. 

&quot;That book, sir?&quot; Jamie pointed to the red book, &quot;Could I please see 
it?&quot; She asked cautiously. For some reason merely asking for the book 
made her feel restless. Now that she was inside of the shop she was 
certain that it was calling to her, whispering her name like a soft 
breeze upon a windowpane. 

&quot;Of course.&quot; The shopkeeper slowly got to his feet. He was as old as 
many of the book and it showed. He leaned heavily upon his cane as he 
picked up a ring of keys off the wall with his free hand, &quot;I think that 
book just came in this morning. I have no clear idea of what it is, but 
I must say that even I am curious.&quot; He found the key to the front 
display, opened it and pulled out the book for Jamie, &quot;I cannot even 
recall why I put the thing in the display like that.&quot; He stated as he 
handed the book over to the girl. 

&quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; She greedily took the book in her hands; it felt warm 
to the touch. The book was bound with cracked and worn red leather that 
had aged to the point that bits of cardboard could be seen fraying at 
the edges. It had no title on the spin or cover and the pages were 
yellow with the passage of time making the words within hard to read, 
however Jamie could feel there was something special upon the pages 
within, &quot;How much is it?&quot; She asked anxiously. For some reason she 
suddenly felt a need to own the book, what ever their secrets were she 
wanted them for herself. 

&quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; The storekeeper said, scratching the back of his head, 
&quot;There is no title on the cover and the words have nearly vanished from 
its pages. I have no idea what it would be worth.&quot; He muttered.

Jamie pulled out all the coins she had from the other days pay, &quot;Will 
this do, sir?&quot; She held out her hand. 

&quot;Now now.&quot; The old man eyed Jamie carefully, &quot;You want that book that 
badly, do you?&quot; He asked wryly.

Jamie turned the book over in her hands. As she did, she could feel the 
warmth move through her fingertips. She then gazed up at the man and 
nodded her head vigorously, &quot;Sir, please sell it to me.&quot; She asked 
holding the coins out before him. 

The shopkeeper laughed and pushed her hand away, &quot;You are a cute kid.&quot; 
He declared, &quot;You can keep it. No charge.&quot; He said with a chuckle.

&quot;I could not do that, sir.&quot; Jamie protested, &quot;Here take this at the very 
least.&quot; She took the largest coin from her hand and gave it to the man. 

&quot;If you insist.&quot; He stated taking the coin from the girl, &quot;Enjoy your 
book.&quot; He said as he watched Jamie happily turn on her heels and leave 
the store with not so much as a goodbye. She stuffed the book in her 
back pocket and started on her way towards home once again. 

By the time she arrived at The Raven&#39;s Keep the sky was filled with 
menacing black clouds that made is seem more like dusk then mid 
afternoon. The sight of home made her forget the book as she ran towards 
the safety of its walls. Jamie entered the caf&eacute;. Her head never rose to 
return those that greeted her as she crossed the hard wood floor and 
plopped heavily upon a bench at a table in the far corner. She rested 
her head upon her hands and stared at the flicking candle in its red 
glass jar. Charles spotted the girl and walked over to the table with a 
sounder in his stride and martini glass between two fingers. 

&quot;Well hello there, Jamie my boy.&quot; He said slickly as he sat down across 
from the girl, &quot;I could not help to notice the long look upon that 
beautiful face of yours.&quot; He said taking a sip of his drink. 

&quot;Oh hi Charles.&quot; Jamie rolled her head in her arms, &quot;Will you stop 
calling me boy in here? You know how much it bothers me.&quot; She 
half-heartedly snapped.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry dear lady.&quot; Charles corrected himself, &quot;Something must really 
be bothering you. For you usually take my head off for calling you boy 
in this place. The writing biz got you down that much has it?&quot; He asked 
concerned for his artiste friend. 

&quot;It would appear I have not suffered enough for my art.&quot; Jamie said with 
a sorrow filled sigh as she took off her hat and set it upon the table 
beside her. 

&quot;Oh Jamie!!&quot; Elizabeth called out from across the caf&eacute;, she approached 
the table and stopped the moment her eyes adjusted to the gloomy 
lighting, &quot;My Jamie you seem like despair has taken a toll on your 
heart. I heard the bad news. Are you going to be alright?&quot; She asked, 
her face long with concern for the girl.

&quot;I wish I could just die.&quot; Jamie declared sadly and buried her face in 
her sleeve, &quot;You were right. It could never be...&quot; She mumbled, &quot;I shall 
never set my eyes on that beautiful face again. My poor sweet Maria...&quot;

&quot;Oh Jamie...&quot; Elizabeth sat down next to the girl, causing Jamie to scut 
over on the semi-circular bench that surrounded the table, to give her 
room. Elizabeth wrapped an arm around Jamie&#39;s shoulders, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry.&quot; 
She gave the girl a tight hug.

&quot;You don&#39;t mean you had a thing for that child spoiled by nobility?&quot; 
Charles stated dryly. 

&quot;Charles!&quot; Elizabeth shot a glare at the man.

&quot;She loved me.&quot; Jamie said with a heavy sigh, &quot;And now...&quot; Her lip 
quivered at the image of her love being lowered into a shallow grave 
entered her mind, &quot;I will forever be alone.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear Jamie.&quot; Beth gave the girl a tight squeeze, &quot;You are the most 
handsome girl in all of Raven&#39;s Keep.&quot; She remarked waving her arm, 
gesturing at the small crowd of artists that had come to drink that mid 
afternoon, &quot;It should be easy to find new love around here.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want new love. I want Maria.&quot; Jamie sobbed heavily, &quot;And now I 
can never see her again.&quot;  

&quot;I know how you feel.&quot; Charles stated solemnly, &quot;That boyfriend of mine 
left me too... and to think he claimed that he could help my acting 
career.&quot; He stated, turning his nose up at the idea.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t tell me you went out with that butler from the Holland 
Mansion after all?&quot; Elizabeth inquired in distaste. 

Charles finished off his drink and slammed the glass upon the table, 
&quot;How dare he!&quot; He burst out, &quot;He used me and threw me away like a used 
feather duster.&quot; He pulled out a handkerchief from his front pocket with 
a whirl and dabbed at his eyes, &quot;I hear even our dear Hazel was badly 
betrothed to some noble this past week. He is such a wretched man. It is 
all so sad.&quot;

&quot;I was wondering what happened to our nudist model.&quot; Elizabeth mused, &quot;I 
think you both should come with me.&quot; Elizabeth coxed with a sly smile, 
&quot;I can find you both the finest of men, and women, that will make you 
forget your worries.&quot; She opened her purse and pulled out a little black 
book. Many rumours had spread about who&#39;s names could be in that little 
book of her&#39;s, yet Elizabeth kept every clients name a deep secret that 
she would go to the grave with. 

Jamie put her hand over the book, &quot;Thank you Beth, but I don&#39;t want a 
one night stand. I want my love.&quot; She said heartbrokenly. 

Charles on the other hand was leaning across the table in curiosity, 
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t know a man that is the strong and controlling type, now 
would you?&quot; He inquired, gently pulling Jamie&#39;s hand away from the book. 

Elizabeth grinned and flipped through the pages, &quot;I think I know just 
the man for you. He is as noble as they get so you will have to make 
sure you are not seen, but I do know he is into that kind of thing 
so...&quot;							

Jamie grabbed her hat as she got up from the table and slid past 
Elizabeth, &quot;I can&#39;t be a part of this.&quot; She said shaking her head in 
dismay.

&quot;Jamie, where are you going?&quot; Elizabeth asked with a note of concern. 

Jamie hung her head low and placed the hat atop her head, again pulling 
it low over her eyes, &quot;To my room. I need sometime alone.&quot; She stated 
miserably, and then crossed the room to a set of stairs in the far 
corner.

Jamie mounted the stairs to the second floor where her room was; 
however, she had no plans to sleep at that moment. She unlocked the door 
and stumbled through the dimly lit room and found a small oil lamp on a 
desk and lit it. The room was small with only enough room to fit a tiny 
mattress and a wee desk. The desk took up the head of the room between 
the bed and the wall in front of the only window in the room. The bed 
had seen one too many days of rest which Jamie did not mind for she was 
more in titled too spend most of her long night tolling over her writing 
at the desk. Jamie sat upon the small wooden chair that stood before the 
desk causing it to creek and whine in protest even against even her thin 
frame. She pulled out the small book from her the back pocket of her 
trousers and gazed upon its cover.

As she turned it over in her hands, feeling the cover, she trying to 
find a trace of the title that was once there. It did not take long for 
her to give up on the title and she opened the book to a segment in the 
middle. Although the words were faded, she understood what they meant. 
It was a spell book and right now the passage before her spoke clearly 
to her heart. Excitedly she ran to her door and made sure that the bolt 
was locked tight. She overturned her bed to give herself more room and 
began to recite the passages as if she had read them a hundred times 
over. Her love would return to her and they would live happily ever 
after.
