<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 28 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Julie puffed out a nervous breath, manning the computer station in the 
Chaser&#39;s section of the massive police complex. Her long black hair was 
tied back, her police uniform crisp, but she looked a bit frayed around 
the edges. It had been a full day since the Chief of police had dropped 
her here to watch the store along with a couple of on call officers and 
it had only been blind luck that nothing had gone badly wrong.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Julie thought tiredly, &#39;I don&#39;t know what we&#39;ll do if there 
really is an emergency, except for me none of us are trained for it.&#39; 
She had taken this job for the extra money, she hadn&#39;t really expected 
to have to do this all alone.

There was movement from the squad room, she looked up to take in the 
figure who was walking in and puffed out a relieved breath. She stood up 
and saluted the slightly smiling Asian woman, &quot;Section Chief Musashi, 
it&#39;s good to see you, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Gwen gave the young woman a smile, &quot;It&#39;s good to be here, Julie. The 
others are all on their way in, and I need to head upstairs to see the 
Chief.&quot;

Julie&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Does he know you&#39;re here, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Not just yet,&quot; Gwen strode by in her sleek business suit, walking down 
the hall to her office. A few moments later she emerged, her coat left 
behind, a determined glint in her eyes. &quot;Mind the store a bit longer,&quot; 
and with that she was gone.

&quot;It looks like the boss is back,&quot; Julie sighed, sitting a bit more 
comfortably as she waited for the others to arrive.

Gwen walked back to the elevator, stepping inside and rising smoothly to 
the administrative levels. There were startled glances from the officers 
she passed as she walked towards the Chief&#39;s office, the secretary in 
front of the door looking mildly alarmed.

&quot;Mrs. Musashi,&quot; the woman said faintly, &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting you to....&quot;

&quot;You might want to let the Chief know I&#39;m here,&quot; Gwen said to her firmly 
in the sort of tome she&#39;d use with a green officer.

&quot;Right,&quot; she hit the intercom without thinking, speaking into it softly 
before looking up at Gwen, &quot;You can go right in, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Gwen ignored the glare the secretary gave her as she went 
by her into the well appointed office.

The Chief of police looked up at her, the older man clearly displeased. 
&quot;Gwen, I thought I asked you to stay away for a few days so....&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s already been two android related incidents in the last 
twenty-four hours,&quot; Gwen cut him off crisply as she continued, &quot;one 
resulting in serious injuries to the officer responding. I don&#39;t have 
time to take a vacation.&quot;

&quot;How did you know?&quot; he sat up in surprise, then shook his head. 
&quot;Nevermind,&quot; he sighed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to know.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been reading the newsfeeds,&quot; Gwen said as she sat down across from 
him, &quot;the fall out from the &#39;Android roundup&#39; plan seems to be primarily 
hitting the Governor and the manufacturers. Something about unusually 
high donations to his reelection campaign?&quot;

&quot;Looks like it,&quot; the Chief agreed. He sighed, &quot;Our teams are having no 
luck in finding out who broke into our computer systems, either.&quot;

&quot;If you want I can have my computer expert Beth Harris run though the 
system,&quot; a slight smile teased Gwen&#39;s lips, &quot;give us an idea of where 
the holes are.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; he sighed. The Chief looked tired, &quot;Our 
communications system is still flooded with protest calls, the Android 
protesters are picketing the station, and even the ACLU is getting 
involved with the court case.&quot;

Gwen looked at him, shaking her head slightly. &quot;I hate to say it,&quot; she 
said with a slight smile, &quot;but I told you so.&quot; She rose to her feet and 
said, &quot;I want to get my people back to work, get my team out on the 
street again.&quot;

&quot;The Mayor isn&#39;t going to be very happy about it,&quot; the Chief pushed 
papers aside on his desk with a sigh, &quot;but call them in.&quot;

Gwen gave him a smile over her shoulder as she left, &quot;I already did.&quot;

Beth walked into the computer room, and the redhead gasped in surprise 
as Julie all but threw herself at her in a fierce hug. &quot;I should take 
off for a day more often,&quot; the little redhead smiled, getting in a 
discrete feel while she was at it.

&quot;Don&#39;t you dare,&quot; Julie grinned, casually batting away Beth&#39;s hands, 
&quot;you have no idea how good it is to see you.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Beth grinned, green eyes flashing. She went around to her 
station, calling up data on multiple stations, clearly back in her 
element. &quot;Two emergency calls,&quot; she noted with a frown, &quot;handled by 
local officers.&quot;

&quot;Chief&#39;s instructions,&quot; Julie said defensively.

Beth gave her a smile, &quot;Not your fault, but I don&#39;t like it.&quot;

&quot;Damn protesters still recognize me,&quot; Kate grumbled as the tall and 
rangy looking sand haired officer came in, drinking her cup of coffee.

&quot;Kate,&quot; Julie grinned at her happily.

Kate growled, &quot;What are you so happy about?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in love and wants to have your babies,&quot; Beth smirked as she 
worked her terminal, pulling together records from other stations.

&quot;Beth!&quot; Both Julie and Kate protested.

Beth didn&#39;t look at all bothered as she waved to the next arrival, &quot;Hey 
Jen.&quot;

The blonde offered her a grin, her eyes narrowing slightly as she saw 
Kate. Jen nodded to Julie as she addressed the group, &quot;Do we know what&#39;s 
going on?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re back on duty,&quot; Gwen said, her silent approach badly startling 
Jen. Kate just grinned while Beth gave their boss a scolding look. The 
intense Asian smiled slightly at Julie, &quot;Thanks for keeping an eye on 
the place while we were gone.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Julie said, blushing faintly.

&quot;So what&#39;s the plan?&quot; Kate asked simply.

&quot;Beth,&quot; Gwen caught the little redhead&#39;s eye. &quot;The Chief is concerned 
with network security after the latest hacker intrusion,&quot; she smiled 
impishly, &quot;he wants a review of the security measures. Can you do that 
in-between monitoring the system?&quot;

Beth gave her an answering smile, &quot;No problem.&quot;

&quot;Kate, Jen,&quot; Gwen turned to them, &quot;you two will be answering any 
emergency calls, with I or Beth supporting. Take some time to clear your 
paperwork, but be ready to move.&quot;

&quot;Paperwork,&quot; Kate made a face but headed to her office.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Jen didn&#39;t quite salute as she headed off.

&quot;Ah.. Section chief Musashi?&quot; Julie asked softly.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Gwen asked.

&quot;Could I talk to you a moment?&quot; Julie asked tentatively.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen lead the young lady up the hallway, the two entering 
her office. Gwen sat behind her desk and waved Julie to a seat, &quot;What 
can I do for you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve been working as a fill-in for the Chasers for the past few years,&quot; 
Julie said nervously, fidgeting in the seat, &quot;and I&#39;ve been reporting to 
the Chief and Commissioner from the beginning.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Gwen said simply.

&quot;I know you&#39;re shocked, ma&#39;am, but...,&quot; Julie slowed to a stop, blinking 
at Gwen as she soaked that in. &quot;You knew?&quot; she blurted.

Gwen just smiled as she said, &quot;I knew the chief would want to have an 
officer he trusted in this unit.&quot; She shrugged casually, &quot;I reviewed 
your record to see if you were qualified, and once I knew that I hired 
you.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t mind?&quot; Julie squeaked.

&quot;You&#39;ve done your job competently,&quot; Gwen said to her simply, &quot;and I have 
nothing to hide from my superiors.&quot;

Julie got up from her seat, &quot;Does that mean I still have my job?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen smiled as she left. She gave the young woman some time 
to walk away before sitting back with a sigh and thinking, &#39;And if I 
fire you, they&#39;ll just replace you with some spy that I don&#39;t know 
about.&#39;</pre>
