<h1>Duet 2 (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Janice looks over the paper again as she starts breakfast, Crystal is 
already sitting at the table waiting for Janice to set out the food. 
&quot;A whole night of thinking leads to these questions.&quot; (thinks back to 
the night before and smirks) &quot;Which is an accomplishment since we 
mostly just had sex last night but it&#39;ll do I suppose.&quot; (yawns as she 
begins to read the questions).

&quot;Is there anyone left in our respective families who&#39;ll actually be 
happy for us and our new love? Hmmm... does the family dog count?&quot; 
(waits for a reply, but gets only silence) &quot;No? Then it&#39;s no way in 
hell they&#39;d be happy for me. I&#39;m the family member nobody talks about 
unless they&#39;re cursing my existence.&quot;

Crystal shrugs her shoulders at the question, &quot;My family will probably 
be ambivalent about the relationship initially, but some of them 
didn&#39;t like Mike too much so maybe they&#39;ll warm up to you.&quot;

&quot;Hope that&#39;s in a warm way and not a &quot;let&#39;s light the dyke and see her 
burn&quot; way. Let&#39;s see. Next question. Is there any friends either of us 
have that&#39;ll actually be happy for us? For me it&#39;s Johnson, the guys 
at the police station, my contacts (because they think I&#39;ll be more 
liberal with my payouts if I&#39;m happier), etc. But that&#39;s just me.&quot; 
(starts cooking hash browns) &quot;What about you?&quot;

&quot;I guess they&#39;ll be happy for me. That could be an interesting 
development.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Let me think about that further.&quot;

Janice raises her eyebrow in a Spock-ish manner, perplexed by the 
answer. &quot;No prob. Next question. Is there any friends who won&#39;t leave 
us alone and constantly bother us? Johnson mostly. He and his wife are 
constantly thinking of new ways to invite us out. He&#39;s weird that 
way.&quot; (sighs as she flips hash browns) &quot;Your turn again, Crystal.&quot;

&quot;I think some of my bi-sexual gal pals might meddle some. Not certain 
about that.&quot; Janice blinks, then sighs at the middle of the road 
response, &quot;Wondrous. Now, who does what around here?&quot; (smirks) &quot;Good 
question. I want cooking, but I&#39;ll split laundry 50/50, and I guess 
whoever puts trash in last puts it out. But what do you want?&quot;

&quot;I agree with your answer. Work should be split 50/50.&quot;

&quot;No problem with that. But I want the cooking, I got this kitchen just 
the way I like it and cooking works off my stress anyway. Well, that 
and sex but don&#39;t think you want to be in that position 24/7.&quot; (as she 
looks at the paper, Janice holds the paper up abit straining to read 
her scrawled notes) &quot;and here&#39;s a note I took from a phone call... 
There&#39;s alot of the slang that escaped me at the moment, but your 
friend from the apartment building (the one with the motor for a 
mouth) wanted to know if I&#39;d (she thought I was you) let her taste the 
white woman&#39;s pussy (that&#39;d be me) and have her for a night as her 
slave because she never had her own white woman before....&quot; (looks at 
Crystal) &quot;You actually were friends with this person? She&#39;s both 
disturbing AND scary!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s my former nosey neighbor, and lord knows she&#39;s going to become 
more of a nuisance as the days go by, she is bi-curious after all. 
Heh. Heh. He.&quot; (straight face) &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;Bi-curious? She was two steps shy of branding me your property!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s just a little bit on the experimental side.&quot; Crystal meekly 
argues.

&quot;She&#39;s well on her way to being dangerously girl crazy. and for once I 
think that&#39;s a bad thing, especially if she does the &quot;Misery&quot; thing to 
all her future lesbian lovers!&quot; (smacks Crystal&#39;s rear with a free 
hand as she begins to put the food onto two plates for breakfast) &quot;And 
stop wiggling in that chair, breakfast isn&#39;t instant you know. (And 
lord knows who&#39;d want to eat instant breakfast! It&#39;s horrid stuff.)&quot;

Reading from list once again. &quot;Here&#39;s your questions. Can I truly get 
over Mike, especially after seeing more and more couples throughout 
the days?&quot; (thinks) &quot;Well, Crystal, I hope you&#39;ll get over him 
eventually. This is our time, not his. He had his chance and he blew 
it, humping Vette&#39; (and lord knows what&#39;s going through her pathetic 
excuse for gray matter these days), so I don&#39;t think you owe him one 
inch of your precious time anymore. Your far too good for him... and 
I&#39;d be sad if you went back...&quot; (kisses Crystal on the cheek) &quot;But 
you&#39;ll have to wait for breakfast anyway like a good girl, so stop 
pouting.&quot; (pokes her cheek) &quot;I didn&#39;t think I fell in love with such a 
cute little muncher.&quot; (leans head on Crystal&#39;s head) &quot;Though when it&#39;s 
in the right place I can&#39;t complain.&quot;

(back to reading list) &quot;Am I (Janice) ready to finally deal with the 
consequences of Yvette&#39;s actions?&quot; Janice sighs &quot;I&#39;ve been avoiding 
Yvette for the longest time, so I&#39;m not yet ready for a total head-on 
collision with the little psychopath unless she harms you in someway, 
then I&#39;m going for the throat and ripping it out. Anyway, &#39;Vette is 
probably still nursing her bruised ego about her cousin being in the 
ground and not by her side, so she&#39;s probably not a person I want to 
rumble with anytime soon.&quot; (hugs Crystal as she stops cooking for a 
second) &quot;Let it go. She doesn&#39;t look it, but when she&#39;s riled she&#39;s 
very dangerous and is prone to do harmful things when she&#39;s gripped by 
her emotions.&quot; (blinks) &quot;Sorta like homicidal PMS that never goes 
away.&quot;

(back to list) &quot;How is Mike able to track us down, then start pleading 
for me back?&quot; (blinks again) &quot;What is this?&quot; (looks about) &quot;It&#39;s not 
like I live in a tesseract or something, so Mike can actually find us 
here. Simple matter of fact is he hasn&#39;t bothered finding us here. 
He&#39;s hoe-ing...&quot; (looks pissy) &quot;...and stop that! I still don&#39;t know 
what a &quot;h-o&quot; is so cut it out!&quot; (sighs) &quot;He&#39;s hoing (there, happy?) 
with Vette&#39; so the only way he&#39;ll come begging is if &#39;Vette dumps him 
and there&#39;s no chance of that. Once &#39;Vette gets her grip into someone 
she never lets go. Sorta like a bad virus that kills slowly.&quot;

&quot;Will I become a workaholic, thus becoming complacent, neglecting 
you?&quot; (blinks) &quot;Goddess I hope not. I only work a few days a month for 
long hours. Now mind you I don&#39;t tell you the boring stuff like for 
weeks on end I stay here waiting for leads to develop, wash the 
clothes, take out the garbage, wait, thought about getting a cat 
because nobody hangs around me when I&#39;m waiting.&quot; (shrugs) &quot;It&#39;s 
painfully unromantic to tell people a lot of the things the City pays 
me for is to sit and wait for leads to develop. And I usually have to 
have my informants drop me e-mails because they don&#39;t want to meet me 
all the time out in public and become linked to me if the wrong people 
see us together.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Hence I&#39;m usually dreadfully attention 
needy and nobody wants to be my attention magnet so you&#39;ll never 
suffer from attention deficit. Maybe you&#39;ll get tired of me constantly 
hanging on you but never be neglected.... whether that&#39;s good or noth 
is up to you.&quot; (starts on eggs) &quot;Breakfast in five.&quot;

&quot;Will the lull in your job lead you back to drinking?&quot; (looks over at 
Crystal) &quot;Slump is barely a day old and already your contemplating a 
&quot;drink&quot;. I&#39;ve been thinking about that though, so I&#39;m one step ahead 
of you. Maybe it&#39;s time you leveled up.&quot; (tosses something at Crystal) 
&quot;I asked Johnson and he forwarded it through the dept. about jobs you 
can pull while waiting for people for your class, and he can get you 
signed onto the city payroll as a lifeguard at the nearby community 
pool (since you know CPR and already are a good swimmer). It pays 
fairly well, and it&#39;s an easy-breezy job. The number is there on the 
paper, top page, so if your interested give them a buzz and they&#39;ll 
make the arrangements.. breakfast, eat up.&quot; Janice sighs as she tosses 
the list aside, &#39;What the heck was I thinking when I suggested a 
list?&#39; (huffs her breath as she begins to eat) &#39;Next time I have an 
potentially awkward moment maker to suggest, I should keep it to 
myself.&#39;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So are you and Mike are getting back together?&quot; Sondra, Crystal&#39;s 
former nosey neighbor inquires as she watches Crystal working out on 
the brand new exercise bike that resembles a ski set.

&quot;No. Me and Mike are not getting back together. We&#39;re just trying to 
be friends now that we are separated. Jan went to work earlier today, 
and since Yvette isn&#39;t here either, I asked Mike if it was okay to use 
the exercise bike out here on the balcony. He didn&#39;t mind. And I need 
to get into shape for the CPR classes I&#39;m gonna teach this week.&quot; 
Crystal proudly states.

&quot;So you must not have moved all of your stuff out yet?&quot; Sondra asks 
with a wry smile. &quot;Not yet. But I will. Trust me, I will. But that 
doesn&#39;t mean Mike and I can&#39;t be amicable about this whole situation. 
We were once civil towards one another, a long time ago.&quot; Crystal 
manages between pants as her workout increases.

&quot;And this Janice is all right with this? She&#39;s not gonna explode or 
anything?&quot; Sondra continues.

&quot;She&#39;s fine with it. She knows I&#39;m not gonna slip up and cheat on her 
or anything stupid like that.&quot; Crystal says.

&quot;But what about her?&quot; Sondra begins, stirring things up.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Crystal wonders.

&quot;Can you trust her? How do you know she isn&#39;t with someone else from 
her past?&quot; Sondra remarks, planting the seeds of dissent into 
Crystal&#39;s head.

&quot;I just know that she isn&#39;t like that. I trust her.&quot; Crystal stammers 
as she grows more tired.

&quot;I don&#39;t know Crystal, you did say her and Yvette have a past 
together. They could be together on some some sorta rendezvous. &quot; 
Sondra implies, allowing Crystal to give the matter some deep thought.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A little earlier that day.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s YOU!&quot; Both Janice &amp; Yvette sighed as they entered the 
building.

&quot;So how much your getting paid?&quot; Yvette asked.

&quot;None of your business, but it was a $10,000 payout for capturing the 
DVD Rapist. Couldn&#39;t collect until they finished processing him 
through and confirmed his ID without a shadow of a doubt (like he was 
that sneaky that he could hide his true ID that long). What about 
you?&quot;

&quot;Hmph!&quot; (Yvette puffs up her chest like a proud peacock and smiles) &quot;I 
scored out big time on that lead which brought down that foreign slave 
market. Real upper over your little penny-ante capture!&quot;

&quot;So you going to tell us or puff up like a blowfish all day?&quot; (they 
reach the desk together and wait for their payouts) &quot;Well if you MUST 
know, it was 11 large! Hah!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s one more than me, and you had to do it for far more people 
than my one catch.&quot; (signs out for check) &quot;The problem with you is 
your petty, and your too full of yourself.&quot;

&quot;The problem with you, Janice, is your STILL alive!&quot;

&quot;Funny. So are you. Thought that snuff film gang was going to 
rape/kill you. oh, wait, silly me, didn&#39;t I save your ass and you paid 
me back by almost getting me killed?&quot;

&quot;Fuck you.&quot;

&quot;Not in your lifetime, &#39;Vetty. I don&#39;t fuck boy toys. I like REAL 
women.&quot;

&quot;At least the thing between Mike&#39;s legs is REAL and not something he 
keeps in a box for occasional sex games!&quot;

&quot;I could make it so he can keep his in a box if you want!&quot;

&quot;Fucking whore!&quot;

&quot;Slut! Homewrecker!&quot;

&quot;Fuck you, home wrecker! Dyke bitch!&quot;

&quot;Cocksucking whore!&quot;

&quot;Now now.&quot; Johnson suddenly appears out of nowhere, pulling Janice 
aside and walks her to his car, leaving Yvette to walk off alone, &quot;You 
two are making the normals blush.&quot; (pushes her into his squad car and 
drives off) &quot;Fucking bitch.&quot; Yvette sighs, getting the last word if 
only in her own mind.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Yvette arrives home in a huff to find Crystal &amp; Sondra sweating on the 
couch (after Sondra gave the machine a try herself). Yvette, however, 
as usual, gets the wrong idea. &quot;About bloody time you traded that 
whore in for a better model.&quot; Yvette sighed as she motioned to Sondra, 
&quot;Fucking half-wit. &quot;Put Mike&#39;s dick in a box for me.&quot; Fucking dyke! 
Somebody should slit her throat &#39;cause it&#39;ll be an improvement in my 
opinion!&quot; (closes door, only to open it again) &quot;AND YOU BETTER FUCKIN&#39; 
STOP SPREADIN&#39; THAT RUMOR ABOUT ME AND THAT WHORE OR SO HELP ME I&#39;LL 
KILL YOU, BITCH!&quot; (pointing straight at Sondra). &quot;AND YOU TWO GET A 
FUCKIN&#39; ROOM IF YOUR GOING TO BOFF ALREADY!!&quot; (slams door, only for 
her to come out seconds later and toss something at the two) &quot;FUCK IT! 
HERE.&quot; (closes door again) &quot;KEEP IT DOWN! I&#39;M GOING TO TAKE A NAP!&quot; 
(Crystal &amp; Sondra both hold up the dildoes tossed to them) &quot;Can I have 
Janice now?&quot;

&quot;.you told me all that shit just so you can crawl in bed with Janice.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like Yvette isn&#39;t easy to hate, and I never had white woman 
before and we always shared a lot of things..&quot;

&quot;.your hopeless at times.&quot; Crystal sighs, regretting she had her 
slight doubts about Janice.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I&#39;m home!&quot; Crystal calls out as she enters the apartment.

&quot;Hi. Sit down, I&#39;m making dinner.&quot; Janice calls out, shaking the pan 
abit as she cooks. &quot;So how was the day over at Mike&#39;s? Yvette find 
time to hump Mike&#39;s leg like the good little bitch in heat? Oh, by the 
way, major payout today so I&#39;m thinking of buying you an exercise 
machine of your own. Let&#39;s go pick one out tomorrow since it&#39;s the 
weekend and I&#39;ll pay for delivery. While I&#39;m at it I think I&#39;ll look 
for a discount treadmill since I could use a workout myself. Then 
let&#39;s do some shameless girl shopping while we&#39;re at the mall.&quot; 
(sighs) &quot;Man, I haven&#39;t done any shameless girl stuff since. aw, hell, 
since I WAS a girl. man, have I been boring.&quot; (shakes food again) &quot;So, 
how was your day?&quot;

Crystal kept her discussion with Sondra to herself.

Which, Crystal muses, isn&#39;t so hard since sometimes Janice can carry a 
whole conversation by herself at times. But that&#39;s just another one of 
her lovable silly traits.

&quot;.why are you giggling like that?&quot; Janice asks, confused by Crystal&#39;s 
giggles.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

As the weekend rolls about, Janice &amp; Crystal hit the mall.

As the two walk through the mall together, Crystal&#39;s eyes light up 
every time they pass by a women&#39;s shoe store. The two enter each one, 
carefully browsing for some flats and summer wear. Giggling as school 
girls, and bringing a few stares here and there, that do not even faze 
the two. They are in their own little world, and loving every bit of 
it.

But for Janice, her eyes always light up every time she passes a store 
that stocks Japanese Anime or Mangas. She pulls Crystal into each one 
she finds, picking up an assortment of nice and naughty videos and 
mangas, making Crystal blush every time she insists on flipping 
through the adult stuff in public and pointing out the lesbian sex 
scenes. A few dozen tapes, DVDs, mangas and collectibles later she&#39;s 
finally satisfied from her hunt and the cherished treasures in her 
possession.

Soon, the two grow weary, and decide to stop off at an eatery to sit 
down for lunch. &quot;So, you just got a windfall from work? Are we going 
to do something else besides shopping?&quot; Crystal asks. &quot;Windfall?!&quot; 
Janice huffs her chest out as if injured by the remark, showing a 
little pride. &quot;I always score big when I bring &#39;em in alive! Penis 
retentive males don&#39;t get pass this little hellcat!&quot; (chews a little 
on her food as she becomes serious again) &quot;We&#39;re done shopping anyway, 
with all the stuff here and the exercise machine picked out to be 
delivered tomorrow. What else is there to do?&quot; Janice replies. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know. Maybe we could see a movie or a play.&quot; Crystal suggests.

&quot;Play are boring. I&#39;d love to see a movie! Haven&#39;t been to once since. 
Star Wars Episode II. (you were still with Mike then so I didn&#39;t get 
to go see it with you). And for someone like me, a few weeks is 
forever! And MIBII came out a few days ago!&quot; Janice beams, her smile 
becoming contagious.

&quot;Well, we better get a paper to see what time the movie starts then.&quot; 
Crystal continues. &quot;Not necessary my luscious little morsel.&quot; (licks 
lips clean) &quot;This mall has a movie theater all it&#39;s own. All we can do 
is stroll on over when we finish eating and take in a certain Mr. 
Smith &amp; Mr. Jones.&quot; Janice says, to which Crystal shrugs with a 
playful grin on her face. &quot;Works for me.&quot; Crystal slyly leans over and 
kisses Janice slowly and passionately. &quot;I love you Jan. Thanks.&quot; 
Crystal allows as she caresses Janice&#39;s hand.

&quot;I love you too darling. I guess that lumbering piece of beef that 
Mike was never did any special things like this for you. But not us! 
We&#39;re going to do tons of things whenever possible! So, you&#39;re 
welcome.&quot; Janice remarks, and squeezes Crystal&#39;s hand. The two then 
gaze lovingly into each others eyes, as they finish their noontime 
meal. &quot;Before we go let&#39;s stop off at the adult novelty shop, I want 
to see if my order came yet.&quot;

&quot;For who?&quot;

Janice grins as she gives Crystal a naughty look, &quot;Guess.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hours later, after the movie, they were back at the apartment doing 
chores.

They had to get ready for the machine&#39;s delivery after all.

Janice sighs as she picks up the laundry and other stuff (all her 
stuff was strewed about the living room) while Crystal waits for the 
Chinese take out man to show up. &quot;You know this place, right? Where we 
called the order in. It&#39;s good, right?&quot;

&quot;I used to order from them when I was with Mike, so I&#39;ve eaten their 
stuff before.&quot;

&quot;You do know if you see small bones on the sweet/sour ribs it&#39;s 
probably cat meat, right?&quot;

&quot;.Janice.!&quot; Crystal sighs, watching for the delivery car. &quot;Where&#39;s the 
machine going?&quot;

&quot;Right here, in the living room.&quot; (moves a pile of stuff aside) &quot;The 
balcony is no good. The building across from us has a pervert living 
in it, caught him peeping through a telescope at this building (which 
is why we NEVER make love with the curtains open). Besides which you 
get a good view of the TV here.&quot; (pulls something out from beneath the 
couch) &quot;So that&#39;s where this went! Here, if you ever doubt my feelings 
for you ever again look at this..&quot; (tosses book to Crystal).

&quot;Drawings?&quot; Crystal flips to first page. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s me.&quot; (flips again) 
&quot;And me, and.&quot; (blushes) &quot;Janice.&quot; (flips through a few more pages) 
&quot;.goddess.&quot; (puts down book) Every picture was provocative, and 
erotic, and showed Crystal (as a beautiful angel) falling in love with 
a pitiful Earth girl (Janice) and making love to her over and over 
again, gracing her with her love. &quot;Guess I shouldn&#39;t ignore my angelic 
duties then.&quot; Crystal whispers, leaning over to kiss Janice. &quot;Guess 
not.&quot; Janice returns as she gives Crystal&#39;s kiss back with abit of her 
own fire added to it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

As a new lazy afternoon turns into a lazy evening, rain begins to drop 
from the dark, cloudy day. Janice&#39;s eyes nearly bulge out as she 
finally moves the machine (one more time) to clear it from the line of 
sight between the TV and the couch. &quot;Damn moving people, give them an 
inch and they take a mile.&quot; (huffs her breath as she leans over on the 
machine panting). Both women have on their comfortable short shorts 
and tee shirts (changed out of their sweats and frumpy clothes worn 
for the delivery men), though now Janice&#39;s was sweaty and clinging to 
her body from the workout.

&quot;Next time work out ON the machine, and not with it.&quot; Crystal chides, 
finishing the last of the dishes. Janice pouts, nearly stumbling over 
the vacuum cleaner she was using earlier, snagging it and shoving it 
back into her closet with a huff. &quot;Say that again next time heavy 
objects need to be moved.&quot;

Janice leans back and clicks the TV on. &quot;Movie&#39;s coming on!&quot; Janice 
calls out, pumping up the volume as she lays back and sighs. &quot;They&#39;re 
showing Lost in Space. Crissy! Come here! You have got to watch this 
movie with me!&quot; She yells from the couch

&quot;I&#39;m right here, Jan, no need to shout.&quot; Crystal remarks, waving from 
the kitchen area as if her presence was missed by Janice, prompting 
her to yell for Crystal to show up.

&quot;Being in the kitchen isn&#39;t the same as being here.&quot; Janice points 
out, motioning to the seat next to her. &quot;Come here and watch the idiot 
box with me. It&#39;ll not only insult us, but make us stupid as well!&quot;

&quot;Sure. What movie is it?&quot; Crystal states, as she brings a small fold 
out t.v. dinner tray with all the take out, alongside paper plates, 
upon it. &quot;I was just preparing the food for us.&quot; (With that she picks 
up abit of the food and pushes it into Janice&#39;s mouth, fingering her 
lips as Janice chews).

&quot;Lost in Space.&quot; Janice lashes her tongue out, licking Crystal&#39;s 
fingers as she pulls them away, smirking as she does. &quot;It&#39;s a pretty 
decent flick for one of those trendy remake of old TV show movies. 
Nice effects and good casting. You&#39;ll love it.&quot; Janice beams, looking 
over at Crystal with hungry eyes.

&quot;You ever watch anything like Doctor Zhivago?&quot;

&quot;.&quot; (her face suddenly does a rather blank expression) &quot;I saw Doctor 
Dolittle once (the original, not the remake), and grew to like it 
alot. Does that count for anything?&quot;

&quot;I suppose. The original is better (I liked the musical numbers). 
anything to drink?&quot; Crystal asks, as she heads back into the kitchen 
to check the fridge.

&quot;Ten types of carbonated hell in the cabinets and fridge. You know I 
always like my sodas at room temperature. Easier on the digestion that 
way (your not supposed to wolf down hot food/cold drinks at the same 
time, gives you upset tummy).&quot;

&quot;Anything else?&quot;

&quot;I guess. Sure, I keep some ginger ale in the fridge in case I want to 
make a jello or a dessert. Have some. And bring me a Coke. None of the 
liquor for me, I fall off the wagon and you&#39;ll end up tied to the bed 
screaming like a girl in a bad hentai flick being gang raped and 
that&#39;d be shitty.&quot;

&quot;What about me?&quot; Crystal coos.

&quot;Fine. I relent.&quot; Janice relents. &quot;Cat o&#39; nine tails gets used 
sparingly and don&#39;t you dare make it a 3-some. And don&#39;t cut off the 
circulation with too tight knots. Better use my handcuffs with the 
fuzzy lining.&quot;

&quot;I meant the beer. (And you keep handcuffs with fuzzy lining?)&quot;

&quot;Actually that went upstate with the two young ladies. One of them had 
bondage fantasies.&quot; (thinks for a second about question) &quot;Oh NO!&quot; 
Janice suddenly realizes what Crystal was hinting at, &quot;Not that beer! 
That&#39;s imported Japanese beer! Strictly for cooking oriental food! And 
the American stuff is for beef and ribs (tenderizes it rather well if 
used correctly). So none for you. I don&#39;t want you to fall off the 
wagon and I&#39;ll end up tied to the bed screaming like a girl in a bad 
hentai flick being gang raped..&quot; (blinks) &quot;.though I better not think 
about it, I might learn to like it.&quot; (sighs) &quot;You better stick to the 
ginger ale, and if your REALLY nice to me I&#39;ll let to sip on the 
cognac (it&#39;s only good for desserts).&quot; Janice demands.

&quot;Aw, just one beer won&#39;t hurt. Besides, I&#39;ve been craving &#39;em lately.&quot; 
Crystal whines.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to have sex later with a.&quot; (sighs again when she looks 
at Crystal&#39;s pouty face) &quot;Alright, alright! Call me a soft touch, but 
alright! Okay. Just one, as in uno, numero one-o, singular. And you 
better not fall off the wagon or something silly like that or I&#39;ll tie 
you up to the bed and make you feel all &quot;lemony&quot; myself!&quot; Janice 
remarks with a serious expression.

&quot;Oh you, you&#39;re so crazy.&quot; Crystal chimes, as she pounces on Janice 
and begins to tickle her. After planting a passionate, loving kiss 
upon her lips, she heads into the kitchen to get her beer.

&quot;You THINK I&#39;m kidding, but I&#39;m one sexually frustrated Otaku.&quot; 
(sighs) &quot;I have a closet full of ecchi stuff and far too much 
imagination for my own good.&quot; (smirks) &quot;Maybe I&#39;ll take one of my 
favorite books out and experiment on you tonight. now there&#39;s a wet 
dream I&#39;ve been savoring forever and a day.&quot;

(looks at time) &quot;Hurry up! The movie&#39;s starting!&quot; Janice yells.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hours later Janice lies in bed next to Crystal. She is, in all senses 
of the term, quite angry. Four biirus later and Crystal was so 
stinking drunk, that her words were slurring. She finally had to be 
drug to bed and unceremoniously tossed into the sack by Janice, as she 
giggled and belched like a drunken college freshman after his first 
dorm party. Janice leans back on her pillow and sighs in a bit of 
regret, staring listlessly upwards into the ceiling as she did.

&quot;Wish she did tie up and mistreat me. at least that&#39;d be something 
different.&quot;

Janice&#39;s first inclination is to tie up her partner and torture her 
with some of her more exotic toys.

&quot;That&#39;s no fun if your too out of it to enjoy it.&quot; Janice picks and 
prods at Crystal&#39;s breasts for the umpteenth time, pinching and 
prodding at the nipples, long since giving up on getting the slightest 
reaction out of her.

&quot;Damn! Your no fun when your juiced.&quot; Janice looks over at sighs 
again. &quot;Mike probably did all the work. not hard for him since he&#39;s 
probably horny as a Bondage Fairy half the time he&#39;s awake. but a full 
out love-fest would probably lead to more drinking from you in the 
future.&quot; So, she instead chooses to blow off steam by pouting, and 
thinking. &quot;Maybe I can make you jealous by.&quot; Crystal has fallen fast 
asleep, and is in no condition for any type of lovemaking this night. 
Which, in Janice&#39;s opinion, stunk.

&quot;Maybe I should have said &quot;I don&#39;t want to NOT have sex if your too 
half-ass drunk.&quot; With a defeated sigh, Janice lies down and falls 
asleep, occasionally pushing Crystal out of her face when the other 
girl rolls over and breaths on her (with her dank biiru breath).

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The next day, the two get dressed to head off to work. The previous 
night is not even mentioned.

They will kiss each other, then head off to their separate jobs. And 
since Crystal was far too occupied to even think about a quickie this 
morning that depressed Janice even further than last night&#39;s debacle.

Janice still has a mad on, but barely shows it. As she leaves she says 
her prayers out of earshot of Crystal. &quot;Dear god in Heaven, let me 
shoot someone today. preferably in the nuts.&quot; (She&#39;s working on 
getting over it. she&#39;s almost there.)

Crystal, somewhat ashamed of allowing her drinking to go too far, 
tries to downplay the entire situation. &quot;I have two classes to teach 
this morning. Then I have two more in the evening. So I should be 
pretty busy today.&quot; Crystal begins, blushing as she catches a glimpse 
of Janice&#39;s sour expression.

&quot;That&#39;s good.&quot; Janice remarks as she slings her holster on and checks 
the safety, &quot;Somebody reported, now get this, a high wire perv who 
climbs trees and telephone poles to film sex antics in bedrooms. He 
particularly likes it when it&#39;s girl/girl action. Think he gets off 
spying on lesbians.&quot; (puts on her watch and checks her beeper for 
messages) &quot;Didn&#39;t you mention that the CPR thing is moving onward to 
being permanent soon?&quot;

&quot;By next month at this time I should be doing CPR on a regular basis, 
and then I can really pull my weight around here Jan.&quot; Crystal 
continues, as she brushes her long, shoulder length hair.

&quot;I&#39;d like it if you&#39;d pull something else. or stroke it. tease it. 
lick it. I was one unfulfilled girl last night.&quot; Janice mutters, 
loading two clips of ammo and checking her gun permit to make sure it 
was where she left it in her wallet, along with her private 
investigations &amp; police credentials.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Jan? If it&#39;s about last night, it won&#39;t happen again. 
I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Janice sighs, leaning over quickly and bopping heads with Crystal, 
&quot;Your forgiven, Crissy. Sorry I&#39;m such a needy girl.&quot; (sighs as she 
leans over and pecks Crystal on the cheek) &quot;I&#39;m high maintenance.&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; Crystal sighs as she puts on her make-up. &quot;I just can&#39;t 
handle my liquor sometimes. I am a recovering alcoholic after all.&quot; 
Crystal whispers.

&quot;Me too.&quot; Janice confesses. &quot;Which is why I stay away from the brew, 
makes me weird.&quot; (giggles) &quot;And it doesn&#39;t help that I have access to 
every sexual act on print known to man for inspiration. Juice plus 
hentai makes for one vicious cycle.&quot; (playfully smirks as she quickly 
brushes her teeth, becoming a tad serious again as she rinses) 
&quot;Crissy, I&#39;m sorry too. I shouldn&#39;t have allowed you to go so far like 
that.&quot; (suddenly stands up and pokes two fingers on Crystal&#39;s cheeks) 
&quot;But I just can&#39;t resist that POUTY little face you make!!&quot; (squeezes 
cheeks and makes goggily noises) &quot;It&#39;s sooooo cute!!&quot; (apologies and 
goes back to prepping herself) &quot;Tell you what, next time you decide to 
get grand standin&#39; Biiru crazed like that, I&#39;m definitely tying you to 
the bed and teaching you a thing or two about bondage.&quot; (sighs) 
&quot;Figured I have all those bondage mangas in my closet for some good 
reason.&quot; Janice remarks with a sly witty smile, as she hugs Crystal 
from behind. The two gaze at one another in the full length bathroom 
mirror, and soak in the beauty that is their union, before kissing 
each other, then heading for work.

&quot;If your lucky I&#39;ll let you watch the tapes I&#39;ll confiscate from this 
perv when I catch him!&quot;

Crystal sweat drops and wonders if she&#39;ll go through with it.

&quot;Oh, yeah.&quot; Crystal sighs. &quot;Better kick the habit quick.&quot;</pre>
