<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 8 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>After the first day Kris and Jenn met, they found themselves walking 
further and further together. It was only a few blocks out of Kris&#39;s way 
and she found herself doing anything too keep from having to face her 
own home to soon. They would walk side by side not saying much, 
nevertheless understanding everything. One day Jennifer slid her hand 
into Kris&#39;s. Kris was confused and looked at the girl walking beside her 
only to be greeted by a small blush as Jennifer suddenly turned to look 
at the ground. Jennifer went to pull her hand away in embarrassment, but 
Kris clenched it tightly. They both looked at each other for a moment in 
silence. The two slowed their pace just so they could stay together for 
a few minutes longer. 

As Jennifer&#39;s house loomed in the distance she began to let go of Kris&#39;s 
hand. Kris didn&#39;t want to go home and tightened her fingers around the 
other girl&#39;s hand. Not yet, not never. The two girls stopped in front of 
the driveway. Neither knowing what to say. 

Jennifer was the first to speak. &quot;I should get going. Mom will start to 
worry.&quot; She said looking at the house.

Kris only nodded, still not letting go. She couldn&#39;t seem to find the 
strength to tell her hand to open up.  Part of her wanted to scream out 
and run away, while another part was afraid that if she let go, 
everything would end forever. 

Jennifer looked at the ground, &quot;Yo...&quot; the words got stuck on her 
tongue, &quot;umm...  You could... Maybe.. That is... sleep over... If you 
want...&quot; The last words were almost a whisper. 

It took a moment for Kris to realize what had been posed She had slept 
over at other kids homes. Most of them were friends of the family and 
she was more told to stay more then anything else. This was the first 
time anyone had asked her to stay at their place. 

Kris looked up at the big house that stood before them. It was nicer 
than the town house she lived in, and, for some reason, a warmth came 
from this house that Kris could never explain. She dreamt about what it 
would be like to live in that house since the first time she saw it. Not 
to be awoken by her parents arguments or her father&#39;s nightly prowling. 
The idea of being able to have a good nights sleep, never mind being 
able to spend more time with one of the few  people she was willing to 
call a friend. The thought was overwhelming. 

Kris stammered for a moment and was about to say something when the 
image of her own mother&#39;s face emerged before her. An angry face that 
would never let her stay at such a nice house. Never ever. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think my mom will let me.&quot; She finally got her voice to utter.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Jennifer stood still for a moment not sure what to do when they 
heard a voice calling out for her. 

&quot;Jenn hon, you want something to have a snack?&quot; Her mother called from 
the driveway. She must have seen the two girls from the living room 
window. &quot;Does your friend want something too?&quot; Kris met Jennifer&#39;s 
mother on two other occasions. She was a very nice lady with a warm 
smile that didn&#39;t make Kris want to run and hide. Instead it was the 
kind of smile that made her want to be held.

Jennifer looked at Kris and then pulled the girl toward her mom, &quot;Mom? 
Ummm...&quot; Kris let herself be dragged along. They came to a stop in front 
of Jennifer&#39;s mother. Kris stared at her shoes while Jennifer stumbled 
on her own words. &quot;Mom, could Kris..  umm... Kris stay over tonight?&quot; 
she finally managed to say. 

Kris looked in surprise at Jennifer. 

&quot;I don&#39;t see why not. It is a Friday after all.&quot; Jennifer&#39;s mother 
answered without hesitation. She leaned over towards Kris who was to 
stunned by the answer to speak, &quot;What do you think, Kris? Would you like 
to stay over?&quot; She asked with a smile while moving to pat the girl on 
the head, only to have Kris step out of reach and hide behind Jennifer. 

Kris nodded over Jenn&#39;s shoulder, her eye&#39;s darted to the ground and she 
let out a little sigh, &quot;but my mother...&quot; She spoke softly. It sounded 
like she was about to cry. 

Jennifer&#39;s mother straightened and smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t you worry yourself 
about it. I&#39;ll talk to her. Now I want you two to get cleaned up and 
I&#39;ll make you both a snack, how does that sound?&quot;

Jennifer hugged her mother without letting go of Kris&#39;s hand and then 
pulled the girl into the house. &quot;Come on Kris, I&#39;ll show you my room.&quot; 
They entered the house with Jennifer&#39;s mother following close by. 

The inside of the house was even nicer than Kris believed possible. 
There was something in the air that made Kris smile. It didn&#39;t have a 
heavy feeling like her home did. More like something uplifting. They had 
entered through the back door off of the kitchen, which was brightly lit 
and smelled of many good things. Kris could not place on all the smells. 

&quot;What would you girls like to eat?&quot; Jenn&#39;s mother asked from behind 
them. 

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Jenn asked Kris, who was still taking in the size of 
the kitchen. 

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kris startled shaking her head, &quot;Ummm... I don&#39;t know.&quot; 

&quot;Do you like pizza?&quot; Jenn&#39;s mother asked. 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Kris said softly. 

&quot;Then how about you two have some fruit for now and I&#39;ll order pizza 
later.&quot; Jenn&#39;s mother signaled towards a bowl of fruit that was set on 
the dining table, &quot;Kris, what is your phone number?&quot; 

Kris followed Jenn to the table and grabbed for a banana while spouting 
out her phone number. She heard the woman pick of the phone and start to 
dial and froze in her spot. Would her mother really let her stay here? 
For the night? Usually her mom was very strict about her being home for 
the weekend. There were many chores to be done after all and her 
homework. Kris was about to stop the woman when she spoke.

&quot;Jenn why don&#39;t you show your friend your room.&quot; Jenn&#39;s mother said with 
a wink. It was almost as if Jenn&#39;s mother knew how Kris was feeling. 

&quot;Kay!&quot; Jenn took Kris by the hand, &quot;Come on.&quot; She started towards a set 
of stairs that lead down to the den. There was a pair of sofa&#39;s and a tv 
in it with a fireplace set against the far wall. To the side of the den 
was a door that lead to Jenn&#39;s room. It was small with a kid&#39;s bed 
covered in pink blankets against the far wall under a small window. Two 
dressers off in the right corner and a long closet along the left wall. 
For Kris it was more than she could ever wish for. Before long Jenn&#39;s
mother called down the stairs that Kris&#39;s mother agreed to let the girl 
stay for the night. Jenn and Kris hugged each other happily and they 
went off in search of the air mattress. It didn&#39;t take them long to 
inflate a small air mattress in the middle of the room before Jenn&#39;s 
mother came downstairs to tell them that the pizza on the way. They 
spent evening quietly eating and curling up watching movies.    

That night Kris was suffering from her usual nightly terrors. She 
struggled to free herself from it&#39;s grip. Curling up into a tight ball 
on her side, attempting to hide from the shadows who tried to get her in 
the night when she felt something slip under the covers with her and 
snake around her waist. At first she thought it was one of her father&#39;s 
nightly visits, but when she opened her eyes, she remembered that she 
wasn&#39;t at home. Looking down she saw that the arms around her were a lot 
smaller then her fathers. The arms pulled her close and held her tight. 
Slowly Kris turned over on the air mattress so she could see who was 
curled up behind her. She was surprised to find Jennifer&#39;s eyes 
glimmering in the moonlight. 

Jennifer lifted herself up onto one arm so she could lean over the other 
girl and brushed Kris&#39;s bangs out of her eyes. &quot;You were having a 
nightmare.&quot; She whispered.

Kris looked up at the other girl and nodded, &quot;I have them a lot.&quot; She 
admitted quietly. The two stared at each other with the moonlight 
shining down on them. Kris felt Jennifer&#39;s eyes wash away all her fears, 
she couldn&#39;t divert her eyes off of the way the moon traced out every 
line of Jennifer&#39;s face. Slowly the two grew closer until their 
foreheads were touching. To Kris it felt like they were one and that 
Jennifer was giving her the strength to fight whatever was torturing her 
heart and soul. She could smell Jennifer&#39;s hair and sensed her breath 
upon her face. Then she felt lips touch hers. They stayed like that for 
a moment. The minutes seemed like hours as the two girls lightly kissed.

Kris suddenly opened her eyes, realizing what she was doing, quickly 
backpedaling out from under Jennifer until she bumped her head on the 
dresser. She was to her feet in an instant, looking around the room 
confused and disorientated. &quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; She 
started to grab her things and run out of the bedroom. &quot;Good bye.&quot; 

Jennifer blinked for a second, confused as to what was going on. It took 
her a moment to realize that Kris was running away. She jumped to her 
feet and chased after the girl. &quot;Kris, wait up.&quot; She softly called out, 
not wanting to wake her mother. 

Kris grabbed her shoes in her hands and bolted through the door into the 
night. The cold side walk shocked her awake as she plunged into the 
night air. It was well past 3 am so there wasn&#39;t a soul in sight to see 
the little girl running along in her pyjamas. She only got a few doors 
down the road when she heard Jennifer calling out for her. She felt 
herself slow down even though she wanted to be far away from there. 

&quot;Kris, Stop! Wait up!&quot; Jennifer caught up with the other girl and 
grabbed her by the arm causing Kris to drop all her things to the 
ground. 

Kris struggled to free her arm, &quot;Let me go.&quot; Her voice choked as tears 
streamed down her cheeks. &quot;Leave me alone.&quot; She felt dirty and didn&#39;t 
want to get Jenn dirty too. 

Jennifer tried to pull the crying girl into her arms, instead both lost 
their balance and the two of them came tumbling down onto the neighbors 
lawn. Kris tried to roll out from under the girl, but Jennifer wouldn&#39;t 
let her. Finally they stopped tumbling around, ending with Jennifer 
laying on top of Kris. Her face buried into Kris&#39;s strawberry hair, Kris 
could hear Jennifer start to cry as she whispered into her ear. &quot;Don&#39;t 
leave me. I&#39;m sorry. I don&#39;t mean to... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; 

Kris felt her arms come up and wrap around the other girl and squeeze 
her tight. They stayed like this under the moon for a while. A car 
passed by and Kris wonder what they must have thought when they saw the 
two eleven year old girls hugging in the grass in nothing, but their 
pyjamas. She suddenly felt herself giggle. Then covered her mouth with 
her hand. 

Jennifer lifted herself off of Kris enough so she could look the girl in 
the eyes, just not enough to let her run away, &quot;Are you still going to 
leave?&quot;

Kris stopped giggling and looked into Jennifer&#39;s deep green eyes, she 
felt like she was being drawn into them.  She shook her head and almost 
to prove that she wasn&#39;t lying she leaned forward and lightly kissed 
Jennifer on the cheek. Jennifer smiled then got up and helped Kris pick 
up her things and hand in hand they headed back home.
