<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Kimberly stood in the shower, warm water pelting off her pale skin, with 
its many cuts in different stages of healing. She closed her eyes as she 
allowed the water to run over the back of her head, causing her long 
hair to cling to the sides of her face and shoulders, being sure to hold 
the far wall of the stall to keep her balance. She could feel the water 
washing the blood down her legs and she clenched her eyes shut tight 
against the image. She recalled a similar sight of blood running down 
her leg before, but didn&#39;t want to remember where it was from. No matter 
how hard she tried to force the image out of her head she still caught a 
glimpse of much smaller legs standing in a tub with the shower on and 
streams of crimson circling down the drain. The image frightened her and 
she felt herself begin to tremble. 

&quot;Have you truly forgotten?&quot; A voice whispered from somewhere over her 
shoulder. 

Kim spun around to find the stall door was still closed and she was 
completely alone. Cautiously she approached the door and tested the 
lock, making sure that no one could enter when she was in such a 
vulnerable state, and stood on her tip topes to look over the door to 
find no one outside of the stall. 

&quot;How could you forget?&quot; The voice whispered again from behind her. 

Quickly Kim turned to find herself alone again, &quot;W... who&#39;s there?&quot; She 
stammered in but a whisper, almost afraid that the other girl&#39;s in the 
shower area would hear her talking to herself. 

&quot;You promised.&quot; The voice came from below this time and Kim glanced down 
to find the drain was plugged and blood swirled with the water at her 
feet and began to move up the far wall. Bubbles formed at the drain as 
the voice spoke again, angrily this time, &quot;YOU PPROMISED!!&quot; It screamed 
causing Kim to staggered back from the drain until her back pressed 
against the stall door. 

&quot;W... who are you?&quot; She stammered fearfully.  

The water suddenly turned black around her feet and began to pump out of 
the drain like a thick tar causing Kim to squirm away from the 
substance. The tar like liquid did not approach the girl; instead it 
seeped up the wall to the ceiling, turning the entire wall black. The 
surface of the liquid reflected Kim&#39;s image back at her and she 
swallowed hard at the sight of her own nudity and the many cuts upon her 
flesh. A face began to form in the liquid as something pushed its way 
out from the depths of the darkness. Kim stared as she found herself 
paralysed in fear. The face of a pale teenaged girl with short straight 
white hair began to emerge from the substance and slowly shoulders and 
arms began to follow. Abruptly the girl&#39;s eyes opened and she glared at 
Kim with black eyes and her mouth opened to reveal a set of long sharp 
fang. 

&quot;You promised me!!&quot; The girl scream and raised her arm to reveal that 
her fingers were still coated in the blackness and formed into long 
claws, &quot;You Promised.&quot; The girl suddenly broke free of the tar and 
lunged at Kim, her claws digging deep into Kim&#39;s shoulder, biting 
through her flesh and causing her to scream out in pain. 

The two girls crashed through the shower stall and stumbled over the 
bench in the middle of the aisle outside of the line of stalls. Kim felt 
her legs collide with the bench and tumble over it, her head connected 
in the brick wall as she fell to the ground. She rolled about upon the 
floor, screaming for her assailant to leave her alone. When she opened 
her eyes she found herself laying the floor of the shower stall, water 
pelting against her skin. She got to her feet and spun around in search 
of the strange white haired girl to find she was nowhere in sight. 
Relieved it was only her imagination she shut off the shower and stepped 
out of the stall and picked up a towel she left upon the bench, wrapping 
it around her shoulders, holding it tightly around her body, and moving 
out of the shower area to the sinks of the washroom and the line of 
mirrors. 

The moment her eyes set upon the mirror before her she started and 
stumbled backwards. There appeared to be a cut on her forehead and the 
skin was hanging loosely over her right eye. Instead of blood oozing 
from the cut she could see that same black tar writhing under the 
surface of her skin. Frantically she tried to remove the tar from her 
face only to tear off a chuck of her own skin, removing the right eyelid 
and part of the bridge of her nose, Her eyeball itself fell to the sink 
like a contact lens of some sort, revealing a shiny black mask beneath, 
a mask with a blue-white glowing eye staring out of a slanted eye hole, 
burning through her very thoughts and a voice echoed inside of her head, 
&quot;You promised you would never forget.&quot; It whispered and Kim let out a 
terrified scream and turned to flee the room when she ran into Jenn, who 
wrapped her arms protectively around the girl.   

&quot;Kim!!&quot; Jenn called out as the girl struggled against her grip, &quot;Kim, 
its me, Jennifer.&quot;

Kim slowly stopped resisting the girl&#39;s hold and allowed herself to be 
hugged. 

Jenn lowered the girl to the ground and sat next to her, &quot;What 
happened?&quot; she inquired glancing up at the mirrors and remembering the 
first appearance of the girl&#39;s twin and the number of broken mirrors. 
Recalling this her eyes quickly moved from the mirrors to the girl&#39;s 
limbs, making sure that the girl was not cut anywhere, &quot;Are you 
alright?&quot; She asked, searching the girl&#39;s arms for any new cuts only to 
find the number of partially healed ones. 

Kim gingerly touched her face with trembling hands, &quot;M... my face...&quot; 
She stared at the girl with intense fear in her eyes, &quot;What happened to 
my face?&quot; 

Jenn searched the girl&#39;s features to find nothing wrong, &quot;Nothing, you 
look fine.&quot; 

Kim laughed hysterically, &quot;I saw my face peel off.&quot; She said between 
giggles, &quot;There was nothing but blackness underneath, just black tar and 
a glowing eye, it was staring at me, accusing me.&quot; She wailed and 
dropped her head into the girl&#39;s lap. 

Jenn lightly stroked the girl&#39;s wet hair, &quot;It is alright. It was just a 
nightmare.&quot; 

Kim laughed again, this time in a more controlled manner, &quot;During the 
day? What is wrong with me? I saw a girl in the stall too, a girl with 
white hair and black claws and sharp teeth.&quot; She explained frantically 
as she clung to Jenn&#39;s arm, scrambling away from the shower stalls at 
the memory. 

Jenn started slightly, &quot;You saw Lauren?&quot;

Kim gazed up at the girl in confusion, &quot;Whose Lauren?&quot; 

Jenn shook her head in disbelief. She remembered Lauren from back when 
she first met Kim and the stories that Kim had told her about their 
relationship. Was it possible that Kim had completely forgot about her 
former life? That prospect frightened her and she wished she knew how to 
help the girl. Unsure what to say she shifted in her place and opened 
the plastic bag that she carried, &quot;I got you some clothes from my room 
and Natalie&#39;s, because I wasn&#39;t sure what would like to wear.&quot; She 
remarked as she pulled out a black t-shirt from the bag and held it up, 
&quot;I also got some of my tampons and pain killers for you, I won&#39;t need 
them all... I hope.&quot; She offered with a nervous smile, &quot;But I can always 
get more.&quot;

Kim was not paying attention as she stared down at the three long cuts 
that covered her shoulder and part of her chest, gingerly touching them, 
&quot;What is happening to me?&quot; She asked in a scared, tiny, voice.

Jenn took the girl&#39;s hand and pushed them back to her side, &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about that right now.&quot; She assured Kim, &quot;It will come back to you.&quot; She 
rolled her eyes, &quot;And boy will it ever.&quot; She set the bag upon the floor 
and fished out the box of tampons, &quot;I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t know how to 
use these, Hmm?&quot; She glanced at Kimberly to receive a discomforted look, 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry I didn&#39;t until today either.&quot; She stated with a small 
smile. She took out one of the plastic applicators out of its wrapper as 
she explained how to use the device.
