Diana&#39;s Room, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

It had taken some time for Diana Angelinous to finally compose herself. 
But she did it. No one could have been angry with her for reacting the 
way she did. After all how many people would actually be brought back 
from the grave like that? It was a shock and a horror. Especially for 
Diana, who was always so kind and gentle in her true nature. The young 
woman had woken up early last night after her second argument with 
&#39;Zephaniah&#39; about his actions. The first thing she did was take a look 
at the vanity mirror in her room. She looked awful, really. There were 
dried tear tracks all over her face; and her eyes looked so red and 
puffy. Not to mention the fact that the sole dress she had been wearing 
was all wrinkled and matted. So Diana made an effort to sort herself 
out. She was in no way happy about anything that was happening to her. 
But this was a distraction from her problems. It was nothing more than 
that. She had shed her pure white dress and bathed in the side bathroom 
attached to her living quarters. After spending a while in there; Diana 
re-dressed in a long navy-blue dress that had been left for her by one 
of her personal maids who kept buzzing in and out of the room every now 
and again. 

It took her mind away from her problems for just a couple of hours. 
Today it was no relief whatsoever. All she could think about was how 
strange things had become for her. She now had magical powers. The once 
peaceful Aesus had now become the dreadful knight Zephaniah. He was 
leader of some powerful organization. Diana herself had been brought 
back to life via the research and technology of this group. What had 
happened to the days when she was just a normal girl in Bristol, 
Neo-England, working at a flower shop? When she and Aesus had plans to 
marry and live together? Diana stood up off the bed she had been sitting 
on and walked over to the open slit window on the other side of the 
room. She looked out at the scene. Of the great emerald grass fields 
that surrounded Neuschwanstein Castle. Diana didn&#39;t exactly know where 
she was but she knew that this definitely wasn&#39;t Neo-England. That 
country had been enveloped in leagues and leagues of snow ever since the 
landing of the Genesis Comet. This place seemed quite bright and 
cheerful, despite the events that had taken place here. 

But then, like always, the minute that she stopped thinking of him, 
Zephaniah came back into mind. Diana couldn&#39;t give up on him. She loved 
him. Maybe there was still a way to show Zephaniah that he had to have 
faith in what was left of humanity. &quot;...I know I can reach him if I try 
hard enough. I know I can. If he is still capable of loving me then I 
know that he is capable of loving others. I just have to find a way...&quot;

And Diana settled the idea in her head. She had to help him. If it meant 
the ruination of his monstrous plans then she had little choice in the 
matter. The Neo-English woman walked over to the edge of her bed and 
withdrew that pair of shoes she had been wearing earlier yesterday. She 
slipped them back on and then went for the door. Zephaniah was fighting 
up above in some additional match to the tournament he was staging on 
this island. Diana had to find him and stop this madness before it was 
too late.

Central Courtyard, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;...Uggghhh...&quot;

Slowly but surely, Setsuya&#39;s cream brown eyes began to flutter open. He 
looked over at his surroundings. He was in the Courtyard. Zephaniah was 
across; leisurely walking towards Setsuya&#39;s slumped position against the 
smashed wall. Then Setsuya felt the taste of blood on his tongue and 
lips. He remembered. He had been struck by that attack of Zephaniah&#39;s. 
That thing he called Arcus Nova. Such a powerful technique. It cut right 
through the Burn Shell that the Fire Cutter had cast and smashed Setsuya 
up into this wall. What kind of power did this man have if he were able 
to do something like that? Setsuya had known that Zephaniah was in 
possession of a strong aura, but...

Nevertheless, Setsuya couldn&#39;t allow himself to be beaten. Not now that 
he knew just what Zephaniah was up to. If he didn&#39;t stop this guy he 
would bring calamity and nightmare to a world which had suffered enough 
already. Setsuya groaned a little, nudging his neck up, and thrust the 
Fire Cutter into one of the flagstones of the courtyard and used it as a 
strong leverage. He hoisted himself up with the support of his sword. 
Into a standing position from which he could remain under his own power. 
Setsuya then withdrew the sword from the ground and faced off with 
Zephaniah once again, gritting his teeth and tightening his hold over 
the Fire Cutter. The Great Knight stopped walking and watched. 

&quot;Ah!&quot; He smiled behind his helmet, &quot;You have risen! Not many people can 
stand after being struck with the force of my Arcus Nova. You are 
clearly greater than the average warrior. But know this; to me you are 
nothing.&quot;

Blood dripped freely from one of Setsuya&#39;s nostrils. &quot;We&#39;ll just see 
about that!&quot;

From that position, Setsuya thrust himself towards Zephaniah and his 
might Shadow Edge blade. The boots of the Japanese man charged straight 
ahead with the utmost of the speed he could muster. Until he reached 
within attacking distance of the Great Knight. The older man acted first 
by grabbing Shadow Edge in a one handed grip and swinging it around in a 
half-moon motion. Setsuya ducked under the swipe, mid-run, and turned 
his shoulder inwards. Right before casting a powerful slice across the 
amethyst tone chest of his armour. A streak of golden friction passed 
along the armour in the path set by the slash. But that slash hadn&#39;t 
even managed to scratch the chest plate. Setsuya narrowed his eyes at 
this. His attack failed? Zephaniah skidded backwards over the flagstone 
courtyard floor and re-gripped the Shadow Edge. Setsuya&#39;s attack had 
done nothing to his armour. Even though he was using one of the Four 
Sacred Swords. And he expected no less than that. Then he drew back his 
free hand and curled it into a fist. Setsuya cried out as Zephaniah&#39;s 
iron covered knuckles punched his straight across the face and turning 
his cheek a dark purple instantly. The Japanese youth stumbled and fell 
backwards from the strength of the punch. While Zephaniah himself 
hoisted that large Shadow Edge blade into the air with ease in a double 
handed grip. He gave his body one boost of adrenalin and thrust the 
sword down in a cleaving strike. The bruised Setsuya saw the thick dark 
blade of Shadow Edge about to come down on him. He swiftly rolled his 
whole body to one side to avoid the blow. The Shadow Edge crushed the 
stone beneath it from the strength of the attack. Setsuya kept rolling 
and rolling on his side until he had gotten far enough away and then 
leapt up into a running stride. He looked over at the poised Zephaniah 
and kept running. But his run followed a path that was cut around the 
Neo-English Monster. 

Setsuya stopped running now that a safe distance of about thirty metres 
had been put between them. And he took the time that gave him to catch 
his breath. Zephaniah had haunting strength. That armour he was wearing 
was obviously made from some super tough metals. Not even the sleek edge 
of the Fire Cutter seemed to be able to pierce it. Now the issue of this 
fight had changed. Before he had been hoping to drag the fight on to 
give Aarin more time in rescuing Lin-Lin. Now Setsuya was struggling 
just to stay in the game. The Master of the Yuuga School had once told 
he and Aarin that one day their lives would depend on their skills with 
the sword. Now it looked like that day had come for Setsuya. Never 
before had he fought in a death match. But one of them had to die here. 
And Setsuya had to make sure that it was Zephaniah who fell under the 
scythe of the Grim Reaper. But with that durable armour and that 
powerful Shadow Edge... how could Setsuya win?

&quot;I could attempt an Inferno Phoenix,&quot; Setsuya said to himself, &quot;But I&#39;d 
need time to charge it and I don&#39;t think this bastard is going to wait 
around for me to burn him into cinders. I know I have to do something. 
But what...?&quot;

Then Setsuya stopped to pay attention to Zephaniah. When he noticed that 
by now, he had lifted Shadow Edge above his head. Its tip pointing 
straight upwards into the bright sunny sky. What on Earth was he 
planning to do now? 

Zephaniah&#39;s voice bellowed out into the vastness of the Central 
Courtyard. &quot;It is high time that you learned about some of the immense 
powers of the Shadow Edge, boy! Lets see if you can handle them!&quot;

His whole body tensed up. All the muscles is Zephaniah&#39;s body reacted. 
His tendons tightened. His calves loosened. His abs puckered outwards. 
His biceps bulged. A thick and bestial growl rumbled within the core of 
this throat. His lips spread open as his blunt white teeth clenched 
together. And the veins at his temple and neck soon began to throb with 
the increase of his blood flow. Then the fanatical tautness of grip that 
the armour-clad man had over his Shadow Edge&#39;s handle grew stronger and 
stronger. If it were possible, Setsuya would have seen the man&#39;s 
knuckles whiten. The free hand of the Knight clenched into a fist. His 
steel boots lodged so firmly into the ground that the flagstone he was 
standing on were beginning to crack. The sound of shattering stone 
interconnected well with the sound of Zephaniah&#39;s dark cries of 
momentum. At the side of his torso, his fist shook. His whole body 
followed suit. The dark amethyst armour he was wearing soon began to 
shake with the rest of his body. All but the Shadow Edge. The runic 
symbols that had been carved into the blade of the sword soon began 
shimmering. With an ashen white light that contrasted the dark ebony 
colour of the sword itself. Setsuya felt himself shake too. From fear. 
The Shadow Edge was giving off a kind of spiritual power that was 
chilling and deep. As if it had existed for all of time and briefly, 
just briefly, could mirror the sadness, misery and nothingness it saw 
for itself through all those billions upon billions of years.

It was truly a weapon like no other.

&quot;Do you feel that!?&quot; Zephaniah called out, &quot;It&#39;s the agony of billions 
of lost souls! You are going to feel its power, Seisuji! This castle of 
Neuschwanstein shall be your tombstone!&quot;

He shouted again to call out the attack. &quot;Earthquake!&quot;

And there was a deafening roar the second that Zephaniah had spoken 
that. Dark light surrounded the body of the metal-enswathed knight. A 
light that blocked him from view to anyone else. But that was not the 
attack itself. The ground itself began to shake like never before. 
Setsuya felt himself be thrown off his own weight and was hurled to the 
ground. He collapsed downwards and rolled into the floor with his back. 
The ground itself was trembling from the savageness of this Earthquake. 
Setsuya couldn&#39;t stay still long enough to think straight. The 
flagstones of the courtyard all began to crack and separate. Loose rock 
began popping up from gaps between those stones and shot out elsewhere. 
The walls joined the floor in their agony. The stone that made up the 
whole of the courtyard soon shuddered for what the Shadow Edge had 
begun. The English flags that had been erected at the far walls of that 
surrounded the courtyard were ripped from their holsters and then 
tumbled to the quaking ground below. Setsuya rolled out of the way as 
one came down for him. It spiked the ground like an arrow. But Setsuya 
managed to avoid being impaled by one. This was like nothing Setsuya had 
ever seen before. It felt like the very foundations of the castle were 
coming apart. Which would put Lin-Lin, Aarin and Ingrid in danger. The 
Japanese fighter rolled back onto his knees and tried his hardest to 
speak, his voice being drowned out by the noise of the tremor. 

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Setsuya tried yelling as loudly as possibly, &quot;You lunatic! 
You&#39;re gonna kill every single one of us in this castle if you don&#39;t 
stop it this now!&quot;

If Zephaniah even heard that he pretended not to because he didn&#39;t stop. 
Or maybe he just didn&#39;t care. Either way; Setsuya was prevented from 
trying a second attempt at reasoning. His eyes locked onto a huge gap 
that was forming from about a metre away. The large crack that broke 
open at about a metre&#39;s width grew and grew until it smashed through all 
the flagstones in its way and began ripping the courtyard into two 
halves. The large divide kept crushing through all the stone and rock. 
And it was heading Setsuya&#39;s way. He grit his teeth and did his best to 
stand. Then jumped upwards at the instant that the divide reached his 
ankles. Any longer in that spot and he would had been swallowed up into 
the lower levels of the castle. While hovering in the air, mid-jump, 
Setsuya looked down at the sheer power of the Shadow Edge. It had ripped 
open a twenty-two metre long tear in the stone of the courtyard floor. 
He could have easily fallen into that. At the starting point of that 
tear was Zephaniah. That clever bastard had actually mastered the dark 
powers of the Shadow Edge. It clearly outmatched the Fire Cutter, Wind 
Soul and Lightning Tooth. Soon after that Setsuya began to land. At the 
eastern half of the great divide that had split open the courtyard. By 
now the tremors and shaking had begun to end. So Setsuya came down 
swiftly and seriously, able to stand normally. But the courtyard itself 
was now wrecked. Battered and ruined. Much of the rock and stone that 
had been broken or loosened was smeared over the scene. That was the 
ruthless power of the Shadow Edge. It chilled Setsuya to the bone to 
think of what might happen if someone ever got their hands on all four 
of the swords. Which was Zephaniah&#39;s intention. This madman had to be 
stopped at all costs before something like that ever happened. 

Zephaniah lowered the Shadow Edge and looked over at Setsuya. &quot;You are 
quick on your feet. Not very bad, son. Not very bad at all. But you have 
laid yourself open for my next attack. You see, your father didn&#39;t quite 
complete all his research to the best of his ability. After all... if he 
had... then he would have learned some of the other powers that the 
Shadow Edge has at its disposal.&quot;

&quot;And just what do you mean by that?&quot; Setsuya questioned.

&quot;The Shadow Edge can do more than simply produce tremors,&quot; The Great 
Knight evened out the sword so that it was held horizontally before him. 
Which presented to Setsuya the fact that its white runic symbols had not 
stopped glowing, &quot;It has the power to shift objects as well as destroy 
them! Allow me to present a demonstration! Thunder Hail!&quot;

Setsuya blinked. What could that mean? He was about to find out. There 
was eight loose fragments of stone left around Zephaniah&#39;s feet. Broken 
from the surrounding walls and from the flagstones that made up the 
courtyard. Those fragments did not stay dormant forever. Much to 
Setsuya&#39;s surprised and utter disbelief; those eight fragments of stone 
began to rise from the ground. Zephaniah smiled from behind his metal 
visor as the rubble floated around his body. Suspended in mid air by the 
magical properties of the Shadow Edge. Then they surged ahead. Right for 
the target that had been made for them. A rush of momentum filled the 
Japanese youth. The rock were heading for him with great speed. He 
hauled off and ducked the first rock that came at his like a cannonball. 
It went over his head and smashed into the wall behind him, shattering 
into chips of rock and dust. The second came from his left. Setsuya 
crouched down in an attacking stance and slashed straight through it 
with the Fire Cutter. The two halves of the stone stopped and clattered 
to the battered ground. A third came from the right. Setsuya turned 
himself around to meet with it. But before he even got the chance to 
attack; the fourth rock came screaming in from behind him. It smashed 
into his back, eliciting a furious shriek of agony from Setsuya. He 
lurched forward in the pain only to be hit by the third rock he had 
forgotten. It flew into his face and smacked him backward. A geyser of 
blood was knocked from the boy&#39;s nose as he fell backwards to the 
ground. The remaining four rocks all came at once and battered the 
nineteen-year-old over and over again. His body was knocked to and fro 
with each blow sustained, each hit drawing a new bruise, cut or gash. By 
the time the four rocks had beaten themselves into Setsuya eighteen 
times, they all dropped to the ground. Leaving Setsuya groaning and 
rolling in pain. Zephaniah lowered Shadow Edge as the symbols began to 
fade. 

&quot;Nothing can match my power,&quot; He quipped, but he was in for a 
surprise... &quot;Huh?!&quot;

Setsuya, with his nose bleeding, his face bruised, his limbs weak and 
his deep chest wound dripping down blood, stood up with the Fire Cutter 
in a loose grip. He shut one of his eyes and gave a defiant smile to the 
confused Great Knight.

The Japanese boy grinned tiredly. &quot;It&#39;ll take more... than a few 
rocks... to keep me down. You&#39;d better strap yourself in, bastard... 
&#39;cause a Seisuji don&#39;t give in... so easily...&quot;

Holding Cell Chambers, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;Did you feel that, Aarin? It was like a quake!&quot;

Aarin and Ingrid dashed down the long corridor of the holding cells. 
They were looking for number eight. That was the one that was holding 
the Chinese girl, Lin-Lin. But there were many cells around. This place 
was deep below the restricted area of the castle. So far he and Ingrid 
hadn&#39;t been caught yet. But it was only a matter of time before someone 
found out that they were missing. So he and Ingrid had to be quick. 
Hopefully Setsuya was holding his own up in the courtyard with 
Zephaniah. 

Aarin spoke as he ran. &quot;I have a feeling that the vibration we felt was 
cause by the Shadow Edge sword. It&#39;s just like your Lightning Tooth and 
my Wind Soul. But its magic can cause earthquakes and shockwaves. Lets 
just hope that Setsuya is okay up there.&quot;

&quot;Look!&quot; Ingrid pointed to a door at their left, &quot;That door is number 
eight! That must be the one we are looking for.&quot;

Aarin breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Thank goodness.&quot;

The two Highland Siblings skidded to a stop. Right in front of that 
large iron door. They could not see inside it. The door had no window or 
bars. None the less, Aarin didn&#39;t give a damn. The Japanese-trained 
fighter gripped the handle of Wind Soul then withdrew it in one quick 
strike. He made a four sharp strokes with the blade. It formed a 
rectangular shape that cut the door open. The large door fell outwards 
and crashed into the dusty stone ground. Aarin and Ingrid stepped into 
the cell quickly and saw Lin-Lin for the first time. The petite young 
woman was cringing in the corner in fear. According to Setsuya; she had 
been kidnapped about three months ago. She had actually spend one &frac14; of a 
year with these people. She was bound to be frightened. 

Lin-Lin pulled her long black hair to one side and scowled at the 
Highland Siblings. She was scared but she was still pretty angry. And 
more than brave enough to display this anger. &quot;Leave me alone! I haven&#39;t 
done anything wrong! Just leave me alone!&quot;

Aarin sheathed his sword, cautiously. &quot;Do not be alarmed. I am Aarin 
Highland. This is my sister, Ingrid Highland. We are friends of Setsuya. 
And we have come to rescue you.&quot;

Lin-Lin blinked. &quot;Setsuya? Is he here?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Ingrid pointed upwards, &quot;But he&#39;s fighting the leader of the 
group that kidnapped you up there in the courtyard.&quot;

Aarin spoke next. &quot;That&#39;s why we must get you out of this place, Miss 
Lin-Lin. The sooner we get out of here the sooner we can get you back 
home to your family.&quot;

A smile finally reached Lin-Lin&#39;s face. &quot;Oh thank you! I just knew 
Setsuya would come for me. Thank you so much for helping me... I owe you 
so much.&quot;

&quot;Save it for later!&quot; Ingrid said quickly, &quot;Right now we&#39;ve got to 
leave!&quot;

Lin-Lin nodded then got off the floor of the cell. She followed Ingrid 
out of the prison room. Then Aarin came out of it as well. But he moved 
slowly. And there was a pensive expression on his face. Ingrid and 
Lin-Lin stopped to look back at the Neo-Englishman. They had no time for 
this now. 

&quot;Aarin!&quot; Ingrid snapped, irritably, &quot;This is no time to be daydreaming! 
We have to get out of this goddamned castle now!&quot;

The blonde boy looked over at his sister, honestly. &quot;I want you to take 
Lin-Lin out of this place. Go straight to South Beach. The two of you 
have been involved in this long enough. I have to make sure these people 
can&#39;t do this to anyone else.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ingrid asked. 

Aarin rested a hand on his waist. &quot;I am going to help Setsuya. I can 
feel something. He and I have a link. I know when he is in trouble. And 
he is. I can tell that he won&#39;t be able to beat this Zephaniah character 
alone. He needs my help.&quot;

Ingrid scowled at Aarin. &quot;Don&#39;t be insane! I&#39;m not leaving you alone in 
here!&quot;

But this wasn&#39;t a matter of discussion anymore. Aarin left a stern 
expression over his face and walked up to the younger girl. He grabbed 
her by the shoulders and gave the severity of the situation to her. &quot;I 
can&#39;t allow anymore lives to be lost or ruined by the Shougatsu 
Financial Group! And Setsuya is my best friend! I can&#39;t allow him to be 
killed like this! And even more than that! I have to protect you, 
Ingrid! I have to protect you and the rest of my family from these 
criminals! They are sure to come after us again because of what we know 
about them! Unless I help put an end to it here and now!&quot; 

Ingrid blinked, shocked at Aarin&#39;s sudden burst of emotion. &quot;But... I 
just don&#39;t want to lose you... you&#39;re my brother...&quot;

&quot;Ingrid...&quot; Aarin brought his sister to his chest and smiled. A smile of 
genuine happiness. His family was what his sword had to be used for. To 
protect them, &quot;I will be fine. Do not worry about me. I don&#39;t intend on 
dying in this place. Now you must go with Lin-Lin to South Beach. 
Protect the girl with the power of the Lightning Tooth. Once Setsuya and 
I take care of Zephaniah, we will catch up with you. Understand?&quot;

Ingrid nodded slowly. She understood very well. The blonde girl left the 
embrace of her brother and then walked up to Lin-Lin. She took one last 
look at her brother before running down the corridor towards the 
staircase. Ingrid could take care of Lin-Lin from here. And as long as 
they kept their wits they would be able to escape Neuschwanstein Castle 
before getting caught. Aarin then transform his smile back into a 
serious expression. Now that Lin-Lin was accounted for; Setsuya had to 
be helped. Aarin turned and followed the other exit out of the holding 
cell chambers. He turned a corner and ran down that path. It let to a 
second staircase. One that climbed upwards. Thankfully, he had studied 
Chizuru&#39;s map of the castle and memorized his way around it. Aarin 
climbed the steps of the staircase in a run and kept pacing and pacing 
until he got to a whole new level. Out of the holding cells and up to a 
more residential part of the castle. Aarin strode through the archway 
that led out from that staircase into a new corridor. But he froze the 
second he saw someone standing across from him. A woman. A rather pale 
skinned woman, dressed in a navy blue dress and carrying a haunted 
expression over her face. Aarin devoured her in a reverie. She was 
absolutely beautiful. That silver-blonde hair, her high cheekbones, 
gentle eyes. What would such a stunning woman be doing in a horrible 
place like this?

Aarin couldn&#39;t help but ask, &quot;...W-Who are you?&quot;

The girl lowered her face, catching her breath. She had been running. 
&quot;My name is Diana Angelinous. I am looking for... Aesus...&quot;

&quot;Aesus...?&quot;

Diana shook her head as if she made a mistake. &quot;I-I mean &#39;Zephaniah&#39;. I 
must find him and speak with him. Before he does something he will 
regret.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Omi-Aorta, Coast of Kuji, Neo-Japan

Both Ras and Julia were stunned to look at Julia now. She was now fully 
in control of all her magical powers. The power of darkness. Ever since 
she had been imprisoned inside the Shougatsu Financial Group&#39;s 
Neo-Japanese Research Department, she had been injected with some sort 
of chemical that kept her powers under control and unable for her to 
use. But this was not a permanent change. She had to be injected with 
the chemical again for its effects to keep going. Now the effects of the 
previous injection were gone. Or maybe, Julia&#39;s fury had actually 
overpowered the effects of the chemicals that lingered in her blood 
stream. 

Whatever the reason, Julia was fully armed in a way that Ayame would 
have never expected. Or even Ras es-Shamrah for that matter. They were 
both astounded by what they were seeing. And Ayame finally began to 
realize why the Shougatsu wanted the British girl back so badly. Her 
power was more radical than any other belonging to a magic user in this 
world. With his plasma Naginata in hand, Ras began to step forwards 
toward Julia. The glow of Baga&#39;enka&#39;s blade grew. Which Ayame also 
realized was a sign of Ras continual evolution. Ras was going to get 
even stronger if another fight occurred. 

&quot;Julia!&quot; The former Dark Katana yelled, &quot;Get away from here! That thing 
will be even more powerful than before! You&#39;ve got to get away while you 
still can!&quot;

But whatever fear that Julia previously held for Ras was gone. There was 
no more fear. No more sadness. No more tears. Just the staunch feeling 
that something had to be done. That there were ones who needed to be 
protected. And ones that needed to be defeated to protect the lives of 
others. Ras marched onwards until it and the flaming Julia were face to 
face. Breathing the same air, gazing into each other&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I was ordered to bring you back alive,&quot; Ras said calmly, &quot;But I will 
use force to take you back to the Research Facility if need be. The 
plans of Dr. Bai and Master Zephaniah must not be effected by your 
newfound independence.&quot;

Julia&#39;s flaming purple eyes looked up at him with pity. &quot;...You cannot 
see it... you... believe yourself to be a crusader for your master&#39;s new 
age. But to him... and to the one who created you... you&#39;re nothing more 
than a toy. A scientific reject born of experimentation. Whose only use 
is the brute force needed to bring me back. You have no idea how 
worthless you actually are to them, do you?&quot; 

If there was a part of Ras es-Shamrah that could feel anger, it 
certainly felt it then. The bio-tech titan growled under its breath and 
thrust Baga&#39;enka straight at the smaller woman. Julia flicked her right 
arm downwards with a single stroke and a paper thin shield of magical 
energy appeared before her. Baga&#39;enka&#39;s blade bounced off it like 
nothing at all. And the glow of Ras&#39; eyes grew in depth. But not of some 
great display of power. No. That was born of pure shock.

&quot;A... Hi-Barrier Shield...&quot; It commented, &quot;...How could you use 
something like that when my data classifies you as a low-level magic 
user?&quot;

Julia floated backwards to put some space between the two of them while 
she spoke to the started entity. &quot;...You think that scraps of data 
gathered by your masters can predict the outcomes of life? There is far 
more to the world than either you or me can understand.&quot;

Ras growled again, but this time with far more zeal. &quot;Regardless! My 
mission is to re-capture you! You will come with me now!&quot;

And he acted on that anger. The frustrated freak swung Baga&#39;enka around 
its body as it lunged at the now floating Julia. His blade hit nothing 
but air. Julia danced around the plasma Naginata like she would a limbo 
stick. And before either of them knew what was going on, she was 
standing behind him. She slowly pulled up her right arm and pointed it 
at her nemesis. The purple flames that surrounded it grew in size. Until 
her whole arm was swallowed up in them. Those flames reformed into a 
weapon. Made only of Julia&#39;s translucent purple magic energy. And it was 
the shape of a sword. Ras turned around and slashed at Julia. The 
mistress of Darkness Magic parried the blow with her Dark Blade magic 
and their weapons ended up locking against each other. Ras struggled to 
overpower Julia with grunts and yells of effort. While the Scottish girl 
stood silently, holding off Ras es-Shamrah with little to no exertion at 
all. But as Ras continued his struggle... Julia pulled up her free arm 
and pointed at Ras again.

&quot;Black Moon Burst!&quot; 

A glorious burst of purple light surrounded the Omi-Aorta as Julia&#39;s 
free hand exploded with magnificent force. Ras let out something that 
resembled a scream and was thrown back by the enormous explosion of 
amethyst energy. Baga&#39;enka&#39;s blade suddenly dissipated and Ras was shot 
past the railing overhanging the western Neo-Japanese sea. His body 
froze in mid-air before it could fall into the ocean. Suspended in the 
air by Julia&#39;s magic. The Dark Blade in her hands faded away as though 
it had never been. But her hand still sparkled with that flame of her 
magic. The magic that was preventing Ras from falling into the sea. 
Julia then lifted her free arm into the air and began a series of hand 
gestures. Ayame looked on while Julia did this. Each time she flicked 
her hand in a certain direction, Ras&#39; body was slashed with more magical 
energy. Over and over and over and over again. Within the space of 
minutes, Ras was screaming like an infant. Its green blood was tossed 
into the air as new gashes were administered to its greyish skin. The 
smoky armour that had once protected the beast was now being sliced into 
pieces by magical power that was as sharp and precise as a millimetre 
thick knife. 

It all came to an end as Ayame yelled out to Julia. &quot;Finish it now, 
Julia! Kill the bastard!&quot;

Julia halted in that instant, her face as stern as the iron that made up 
the Omi-Aorta. &quot;...No.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean no?!&quot; Ayame was thrown for six, &quot;That thing has been 
stalking us for months! It killed your Father! You can&#39;t let that animal 
walk the earth anymore than it already has!&quot;

While the battered Ras dangled in the air, suspended by Julia&#39;s magic, 
the Scottish woman spoke on. &quot;Ayame. Do you remember what I said to you 
the day we first met Ras?&quot;

&quot;...Something about forgiving people to end hatred.&quot; She replied. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Julia closed her eyes, still beaming purple, &quot;Nothing comes of 
it. Of hatred. There are some people who can only be reasoned with by 
force. And I accept that. But my way is never to live my life like that. 
I&#39;m taking no pleasure in doing this. But... I won&#39;t betray my sense of 
right and wrong because of my Father&#39;s death. I&#39;ll honour him not with 
revenge... but with the knowledge that I fulfilled his dream of me 
getting home safely. And finding love. The love of a woman who can 
protect me.&quot;

Something about all of that made a chilling kind of sense to Ayame. If 
she could have gotten revenge for her parent&#39;s death, she would have 
done it long ago. But Julia was different. She would suppress her own 
feelings of sadness and anger for the greater good. Even if it meant 
sparing the one whom had killed her father. Now Ayame was beginning to 
understand how truly special Julia McAmish really was. 

Then Julia turned to Ras es-Shamrah, beaten and bleeding. &quot;...I&#39;m not 
going to kill you. But I cannot let you run free either. You&#39;d just 
recover, strengthen yourself, and then come after Ayame and I again. So 
you&#39;ll just have to waste away in a place where you can harm no one 
else.&quot;

Julia used her free hand and looked over at the space of air next to 
Ras. Her hand gripped into a fist. And suddenly new magic was awakened. 
A circular cluster of bright purple force broke open in the air. Which 
wasn&#39;t an attack. But rather a gateway. To somewhere that not even Ras 
es-Shamrah could escape from. With her other upheld arm, Julia swung her 
hand. And Ras&#39; body was thrown with that movement straight into the 
portal. The bio-tech being gave its last cry and tumbled into that void, 
which Julia sealed up seconds later. And a thick silence filled the air. 
Only broken by the occasional cry of the seagulls and the waves of the 
sea. Ayame blinked at Julia&#39;s power. She would have never guessed that 
she was so strong when it came to magic. But it had its limits. Julia&#39;s 
eyes fluttered and she drooped down with tiredness, obviously stretched 
by the powers of her own magic. Ayame quickly ran over to the girl and 
caught her before she collapsed.

Julia slumped into her love&#39;s arms and smiled softly. &quot;...Did... I do 
well...?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ayame confirmed, bringing Julia closer to her, &quot;...I&#39;m just 
glad that you&#39;re okay. I never expected to see anything like that from 
you. Where did you send Ras?&quot;

The brown-haired magic user shook her head. &quot;I have no idea. Sealing 
magic can be very unpredictable. He is most likely in a place that 
nobody will ever reach. He&#39;ll eventually get free... such spells never 
last. But that won&#39;t be for centuries to come. And by then...&quot;

&quot;He won&#39;t be much of a threat anymore...&quot; Ayame chuckled to herself, 
&quot;Humph. It&#39;s ironic. I was hired to protect you from danger. But in the 
end... you were the one who had to save my bacon. I guess my days as the 
Dark Katana really are over.&quot;

&quot;Does that bother you...?&quot; Julia questioned.

&quot;Nope,&quot; And she stared into Julia&#39;s eyes to say this, &quot;Because I found 
something far more important to me than money. Happiness. With you. And 
I&#39;ll ask for nothing more than that.&quot;

A sentiment that Julia fully understood. Julia closed her eyes, which 
now reverted back to their normal colour of green, and settled into her 
love&#39;s embrace. &quot;...Ayame...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Central Courtyard, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;Burn Shell!&quot;

The swirling shot of burning fire came at Zephaniah speedily, roasting 
the air around it. It became more focused as it headed for the Great 
Knight; the twirl growing in intensity and the fire burning more 
sharply. Zephaniah scowled at the attack and rushed ahead. The moment it 
came within a metre of him; Zephaniah stepped around the flaming shot 
with a frightening swiftness. The Burn Shell sailed straight past 
Zephaniah and shot into the far wall from him. It exploded upon contact, 
blowing away waves of dust and burnt rock. And also had the added effect 
of setting that wall on fire. Zephaniah rushed forwards with the Shadow 
Edge behind him in a two-handed grip. He had Setsuya off guard. The 
Monster of  Neo-England swung his mighty sword around him in a 
half-circle motion. It sliced straight through that image of Setsuya. 
But did nothing. Zephaniah&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. The image of 
Setsuya standing there, unguarded, faded away. 

&quot;What trickery is this?!&quot; The Knight bellowed, &quot;An After Image!?&quot;

&quot;Yaaah!&quot;

The real Setsuya wasn&#39;t quite so foolish. The younger man came down at 
Zephaniah from above; with the Fire Cutter aiming downwards. Zephaniah 
looked upwards and saw this. He swung Shadow Edge back around and then 
above him to block. The two swords came to clash with an echoing bang; 
but Fire Cutter could not stand its ground. Setsuya and his weapon 
almost bounced off the Shadow Edge from the power of the collision. He 
fell back and skidded into the ground. The back of his brown bomber 
jacket scraped at the floor of the Central Courtyard. That Shadow Edge 
was more powerful than Setsuya could have ever imagined. The young lad 
skidded backwards until he flipped his legs up. His body curled along 
with it and leapt up into a stand. On two feet. Zephaniah growled to 
himself and went on the attack. Something that Setsuya would not have 
predicted from a fairly defensive fighter. The Knight gave another 
two-handed grip over the Shadow Edge and swung for Setsuya. He stepped 
back and rotated his body around it, dodging and darting as Zephaniah 
angrily tried to land  continuous killing blows. It looked like 
Zephaniah was getting a little angry that Setsuya had been able to last 
against him. For that, the Japanese boy was grateful. And least if he 
died here he could rest assured in the idea that he had managed to piss 
this guy off. Setsuya continued stepping backwards, ducking and dodging 
all the attacks that Zephaniah could manage against him. One final slash 
came with the Shadow Edge came. Setsuya ducked under it. It passed over 
his head, just about shaving off a hair of his chocolate brown ponytail. 
Setsuya sidestepped cautiously around the blade and moved to one side. 
He brought up the Fire Cutter with a double-handed grip and curved it 
over his head.

&quot;Yah!&quot;

The Fire Cutter came down in a sharp strike. Hitting the purple-coloured 
armour of the shoulder. The sword rebounded off the armour in the same 
way it had done with the Shadow Edge. Setsuya stepped back from the 
force and scowled. If things kept going like this then he didn&#39;t stand a 
chance. Even if he was faster than his opponent. This time around 
Zephaniah attacked with the back of his iron knuckles. Setsuya tugged 
his head back and dodged the Knight&#39;s backhanded punch. He continued his 
pace backwards and followed away from the Neo-Englishman. But not so 
quickly. He was beginning to tire out. And Zephaniah could see it. The 
loss of blood from the gash across Setsuya&#39;s chest and the battering he 
got from the Thunder Hail had taken its toll. And it was beginning to 
show. This time Zephaniah held nothing back and attacked with all he 
could do. The older man hauled Shadow Edge over him then back down and 
slashed straight at Setsuya&#39;s shoulder. The Japanese man grunted as the 
tip of the blade sliced through his jacket and cut him open. A squirt of 
blood followed the blade out of his path, that spilled on the cracked 
flagstones of the courtyard. Setsuya stepped back and grit his teeth. He 
shut an eyelid and gripped the fresh new wound at his shoulder. He was 
running out of energy. Fast. 

&quot;...This ain&#39;t good,&quot; Setsuya mumbled to himself, &quot;...I shouldn&#39;t have 
used up so much energy when I fought Aarin yesterday... if only I had 
more to give today...&quot;

Zephaniah hoisted Shadow Edge up for a second strike. &quot;Time to die, 
boy!&quot;

&quot;Wind Cluster!&quot;

A familiar sound of circling wind could be heard coming down from above. 
But Zephaniah had no idea what it meant. Even though Setsuya did. The 
wave of warped air shot down sharply and banged into the thick metal of 
Zephaniah&#39;s helmet. Enough of a blow to make even him sit up and notice. 
The Great Knight stumbled back from the suddenness of the wind strike, 
protecting Setsuya from harm in that brief instant. Setsuya looked over 
at the ledge of the wall to the left. On top of it, with his form 
gleaming in the sun behind him, was Aarin Highland. With the Wind Soul 
unsheathed and ready to go. 

Setsuya smiled happily. &quot;Aarin!&quot;

There was also someone else. A short distance from Aarin was a slightly 
older woman of about four or three years. She seemed rather distressed 
at what she was seeing. But while Setsuya didn&#39;t know who that woman 
was, Zephaniah did. The armoured warrior looked over at the far wall in 
anger of the one who had struck him with magic. But his resolve weakened 
the second he saw the one next to her.

&quot;Diana!&quot; Zephaniah yelled, &quot;What are you doing here!?&quot;

She froze. The girl was so shocked by what she was seeing that she 
couldn&#39;t move or speak. But that wasn&#39;t Aarin&#39;s problem. The young man 
didn&#39;t run down the steps of the wall that led to the courtyard. He 
acrobatically somersaulted forward and jumped off the ledge. He flipped 
around swiftly in the warming air and landed down into a crouched 
position on the flagstones of the courtyard. With the Wind Soul at hand. 
Setsuya smiled and walked around the periodically dazed Zephaniah, to 
meet with his friend. 

Setsuya came to a stop when they reached each other. &quot;Ah, it&#39;s good to 
see you, my friend. This little match isn&#39;t quite the picnic I imagined 
it would be.&quot;

&quot;I guessed as much,&quot; Aarin commented, &quot;You do not need to worry. Ingrid 
and I freed the girl Lin-Lin. She is safe and unharmed. Ingrid is 
escaping with her as we speak. And I think we should join them. Just as 
soon as we take care of this megalomaniac.&quot; 

Setsuya turned to face Zephaniah. &quot;You don&#39;t know the half of it. This 
man has dangerous plans. If he ever gets his hands on the four swords we 
can kiss our lives goodbye. He has to die before he can do that damage. 
But he&#39;s stronger than he looks. Even my Burn Shell doesn&#39;t work on him 
and the Wind Cluster just stunned him for a little bit.&quot;

&quot;Then what exactly do you suggest we do?&quot;

&quot;Buy me some time to charge an Inferno Phoenix,&quot; Setsuya suggested, 
&quot;It&#39;s my best attack. If that can&#39;t beat him, nothing can. I know its 
selfish of me to ask you this; because it may cost you... your life. But 
can you do that for me, Aarin?&quot;

Aarin smiled. &quot;Count on it.&quot;

Setsuya smiled back to him. &quot;Okay then! Let&#39;s rock!&quot;

And so Aarin did. The Englishman&#39;s boots strode forwards from a stroll 
into a run. He paced and paced towards the dark Zephaniah. While Setsuya 
began the process of the Inferno Phoenix. He evened himself out and 
stood upright. Setsuya took a deep breath and concentrated his mind on 
the Fire Cutter. This had to be the shot that counted. So he had to take 
it seriously. And put every single ounce of power he had left into it. 
The Japanese swordsman pulled up the Fire Cutter in one sleek motion. He 
shut his eyes closed and then held the Fire Cutter out in front of him 
in a horizontal position. The hilt was gripped at the handle with both 
hands. He sucked in air then released it slowly. The earliest part of 
the Inferno Phoenix Attack. Setsuya had to be very calm if he were ever 
going to be able to get the maximum out of the move. He blocked 
everything else out and just concentrated on the task at hand. Nothing 
else mattered now that Lin-Lin was safe. All he had to do was stop the 
insidious Zephaniah before he carried out his nightmarish plans. 

While Setsuya began charging the Inferno Phoenix, Aarin Highland stopped 
just ahead of the Great Knight. The two Neo-English borne fighters 
stopped and watched each other. Aarin had suspected that this man was 
significant for sometime but didn&#39;t really pay any attention to his 
instincts. But now they were proved right. Zephaniah was no ordinary 
fighter. Just the fact that he mastered handling the Shadow Edge was 
proof of that much. But the fact that he was able to beat up on Setsuya 
like he was a novice...? That pushed the nail straight into the coffin. 
Now he needed to take this guy on to buy Setsuya some more time for the 
Inferno Phoenix. 

Aarin scowled at the taller man. &quot;So you are the one behind the 
tournament and all this madness. I should have thought that you were 
untrustworthy. For what reason would someone host a tournament where the 
matches are un-monitored on a remote island?&quot;

Zephaniah chortled. &quot;Silly boy. You have done nothing more than dance to 
my tune. Bringing the Wind Soul here was a fatal mistake for you. But it 
will lead to the ultimate fulfilment of my intentions. The new world 
that I will shape is coming. It will be here soon and you and your 
fellow people shall never lay your eyes upon it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right, we won&#39;t,&quot; Aarin replied, &quot;Because I&#39;m going to see to it 
that you never get away with what you&#39;ve planned. It&#39;s time you saw what 
a Yuuga swordfighter can do!&quot;

&quot;You have nothing. I&#39;ve already made your friend look like a joke. I am 
going to kill the pair of you pesky gnats. You&#39;ve caused me far too much 
trouble already. I will destroy you and then take your sword! Then move 
on to that sister of yours with the Lightning Tooth!&quot;

&quot;You lay a hand on my Sister and I&#39;ll make you beg to die!&quot; Aarin 
re-sheathed the Wind Soul in the long scabbard by his waist. He then 
gripped the hilt again and focused his mind. He would never let this 
psycho touch his sister or any other member of his family. It was time 
for some of the Highland Bravado that they had become so well known for. 
The poised Aarin then drew his sword a second later a slashed brutally 
through the air with a battle cry. A flash of friction passed over the 
metal of Zephaniah&#39;s chest plate. But not a single scratch was made. 
Aarin looked on with confusion. The Air Wave Stroke hadn&#39;t so much as 
dented that armour. What was it even made of?

Zephaniah smirked behind his metal visor. &quot;A skilful attack. But nothing 
can pierce the hide of my Iron Valkyrie Armour. I am untouchable. And 
you will die.&quot;

Aarin begged to differ. The Neo-Englishman jumped backwards in a 
somersault without sheathing the Wind Soul. He landed just a short 
distance back from his previous position and settled. He grabbed the 
hilt of his sword in a double grip and locked his attentions back on 
Zephaniah. His sword and the space around him was soon taken over by the 
power of the wind. It swirled around his body and waves of dust were 
pushed away from his boots. Along with the rubble that had been created 
by the Earthquake attack from the Shadow Edge. 

Aarin&#39;s sword soon began glowing with white light. &quot;I used to be 
heartless. I really didn&#39;t care about anything other than improving my 
sword skills. Ironically it made me weaker than I would have wanted or 
have been able to tolerate. But I see the truth now. True strength comes 
from having something to protect. From having purpose. You and your 
sword are misguided. This is why... you cannot win! Wind Cluster!&quot;

Aarin slashed downwards and invoked the power of his magical attack, the 
Wind Cluster. But rather than shirk from the magical wind, Zephaniah 
stood his ground. He brought the Shadow Edge close to his body in a 
vertical position. The swerving burst of compressed wind power heaved 
into the thick blade of the enemy. And then the Great Knight swept the 
sword back downwards. The gust of wind was batted away like it was 
nothing. Aarin blinked at the speed and power with which this was done. 
Not even Setsuya could dismiss the Wind Cluster like that. 

&quot;Fool!&quot; Zephaniah barked loudly, &quot;I too have a purpose. Though it might 
not be as simple or as childish as yours. I have seen true darkness. The 
darkness of mankind. A people so frightened by the devastation caused by 
the Genesis Comet that they are able to shirk their own morals for 
personal gain. Rather than gather their efforts and attempt at some form 
of revival for their home world... they bicker and fight over it like 
dogs. They rape and pillage those of good intention. And those who are 
not heartless enough to play that game are left at the wayside. I will 
destroy all of this. My perfect world will be born from the ruins of 
this one. Such is not only my will... but my fate.&quot;

Aarin pushed his right leg back and braced himself. &quot;Your fate is death, 
if I have anything to say about it!&quot;

The blonde one pushed ahead and slashed at Zephaniah with the Wind Soul. 
The Knight parried the blow with the Shadow Edge and began a chain of 
clashes. Aarin sliced and stabbed roughly in the hopes of breaking the 
guard of this larger fighter. It wasn&#39;t working. In fact, Aarin wasn&#39;t 
gaining any ground here at all. The younger man scowled and forced more 
power into his strikes but it was no use. Zephaniah summarily countered 
each strike with halting return blows. It ended with the Wind Soul 
locking swords with the large Shadow Edge. Aarin leaned backwards and 
maintained his efforts with difficultly as the larger, more experienced 
Zephaniah bore down upon him with the larger sword. A frontal 
battle--strength against strength--would not work against him. Setsuya 
really was not kidding about this man&#39;s vigour. Zephaniah forced Aarin 
out of the sword lock with one final push. Aarin stumbled back, only to 
be hit squarely in the face by the metal elbow of the Iron Valkyrie 
armour. The elbow attack pushed the eldest of the Highland Siblings 
back. Leaving him wide open for a follow up. Zephaniah growled 
bestially.  The Shadow Edge came around in a half-circle motion again. 
But this time it didn&#39;t miss its mark. That mighty blade slashed right 
through Aarin&#39;s garb, cutting him open at the abdomen. Blood spurted 
outwardly as the sword swept away. While Aarin stifled his shot of pain 
as best he could. But he couldn&#39;t help from lurching forward. Aarin&#39;s 
head managed to look up, with one eye closed, but smiled. For all his 
pain, he smiled.

Zephaniah frowned at this and grabbed Aarin by the collar of his jacket. 
&quot;Hmph. You have nothing to smile about, boy. You are going to die here.&quot;

&quot;Heh...&quot; Aarin nudged his head backwards, over his shoulder, &quot;...I 
wouldn&#39;t be so sure of that if I were in your position... you 
psychopathic bastard...&quot;

It was then that the Great Knight looked over at what Aarin had been 
pointing at. And his blood red eyes widened behind his visor when he saw 
what was there. Across from where he and Aarin were; was Setsuya 
Seisuji. The boy held up the Fire Cutter in front of him. Which was now 
burning with the runic symbols akin to those of the Shadow Edge. Around 
his beaten body were the flames that had risen from the Fire Cutter. 
They circled his body over and over again at a fair distance. And those 
flames cast a glow of power on him that indicated everything to anyone 
who could have seen it. Even Diana, who still stood up above on the left 
ledge of the surrounding wall, cast her eyes to the sight of the 
Seisuji-boy being bathed in hot fire. The ears of all four people in 
that courtyard soon buzzed with that distinct sound of a shriek. The 
shriek of a great bird. And just like the phoenix that rose up from the 
ashes of its own destruction, Setsuya was filled with all new faith and 
readiness. 

&quot;Aarin, get out of the way!&quot; Setsuya gave the plea before screaming, 
&quot;Inferno Phoenix!&quot;

A second shriek bellowed out into that vast courtyard. As well as a 
great rumbling noise that came from the awakening of the Great Bird of 
Fire. The flames that surrounded Setsuya burst into new life and took on 
a whole new form. The fire spread out wings from both sides and a formed 
at flaming head at the summit. And the flapping of those flaming wings 
caused a mighty gust to pour through the courtyard. Giving Aarin enough 
time to dislodge himself from Zephaniah&#39;s grip and rolled backwards, out 
of the way. The Inferno Phoenix rose up and flew straight from Setsuya 
over to Zephaniah. Shooting itself ahead like a fiery missile. No 
defence could have been made against something like that. Setsuya, Aarin 
and Diana all looked on as the Great Knight Zephaniah was engulfed by 
the furious molten power of the Inferno Phoenix. All had to cover their 
eyes from the flaming light. But all could hear Zephaniah&#39;s shrieks and 
screams of agony from the heat of the attack as he was swallowed up by 
it. The phoenix of flames left behind a blackened trail of ash as it 
threw Zephaniah backwards over the courtyard. And a gigantic explosion 
hit the wall when the Inferno Phoenix collided with it. Aarin, Setsuya 
and Diana all got down as the enormous explosion made the entire castle 
of Neuschwanstein shake. It had already been damaged by the Earthquake 
attack of the Shadow Edge. It was weakened even further. 

When Aarin and the others finally got back up and looked at the damage, 
it was proved to be immense. Fire was all across the courtyard. 
Insatiable fire and damaged stone. Nothing else. The air was warping 
from the heat, moving in waves. Thick clouds of smoke rose into the 
skies above. And that shaking the castle underwent previously was 
happening again. But all eyes were on the fate of Zephaniah. The three 
looked over at the wall he had been blown into. The wall was burning 
with the flames of the phoenix, blackened like charcoal. Zephaniah was 
inside it. His legs hung out of the hole in the wall while his body was 
left inside it in a nasty position. The front of his armour had been 
burned right off in the centre. The flesh of his stomach was now 
showing. But it was covered in blood and singed scraps of his skin. His 
armour was now a dark blue colour; burned by the Phoenix. His helmet had 
been blown off. And his strong face had been charred by the force of 
Fire Cutter&#39;s attack. Zephaniah was alive. But just barely. 

Aarin stood up and slowly walked over to the dying body. He sheathed the 
Wind Soul and gripped the wound at his waist. Setsuya did the same, 
walking between the fires that had sprung from the burning wings of the 
savage Inferno Phoenix. For the first time he truly grasped the power of 
these weapons. And how dangerous they really were. Setsuya and Aarin 
walked up to the crater in the wall. To see Zephaniah there, clinging to 
life. He was defeated. But neither Aarin nor Setsuya felt very proud 
about it.

&quot;S-So...&quot; Zephaniah coughed up blood as he spoke, &quot;...Y-You&#39;ve won... 
the match... but you will... regret this... I... swear it. Your 
actions... have allowed... a sinful world... to continue without 
punishment... the world that had me watch... my fianc&eacute;... raped and 
killed... the world that... allows the greedy to be fed... and the poor 
to be... exploited... human beings... will ruin what is... left of the 
world... until nothing... can be saved... are you happy... with that 
idea...? Are you proud... of yourselves... now that you... have 
sacrificed... my utopia... to the flames...?&quot;

Aarin scowled at him. &quot;You&#39;re not the judge of mankind. We can shape our 
own paths in life. The only way things are ever going to get better is 
if we instil faith in our fellow man. What&#39;s the point of living in a 
world of many when you cannot have faith in others? I finally see that 
now.&quot;

Setsuya nodded. &quot;It&#39;s over for you, man. With all the power you&#39;ve 
amassed you could have helped bring about a peaceful revival of the 
world. But you let your damned hatred take over. And now you&#39;re gonna 
die in the flames of your own little empire.&quot;

Zephaniah pulled his face into a smile. &quot;...I-Idiots... one day... y-you 
will see... the true nature of this w-world... and you will regret... 
that you... opposed me...&quot;

The man&#39;s body feel silent. While the flames behind them soon became far 
more urgent. Setsuya and Aarin turned to each other as the fires grew to 
a fever pitch. Rubble was falling down from the surrounding walls and 
smoke grew thicker and thicker. But though he was concerned with that; 
Aarin was even more concerned when he looked up at the left ledge. Diana 
wasn&#39;t there anymore. Where on earth could she have gone?

Setsuya coughed a little. &quot;We better get out of here, Aarin! This whole 
castle is gonna burn down and we&#39;ll go along with it if we don&#39;t move!&quot;

&quot;...Yes... sure...&quot;

There was no choice left in the matter. The two Yuuga Fighters dashed 
away the corpse of Zephaniah and towards the door at the other side of 
the courtyard to make their escape. But Diana had not vacated the place. 
The young woman, tears passing down her eyes, stood in the flames of 
destruction. Apparently she was learning more about her powers. Because 
she was unfazed by the flames that surrounded her. All she could see was 
her love, Aesus. The man who had become the Great Knight Zephaniah. He 
was dying. The blonde woman stepped over the broken stone and looked 
into the hole that her love had been knocked through. And saw one of his 
eyes open to stare at her.

&quot;Aesus...&quot; A tear was already passing down her face. 

&quot;D-Diana...&quot; Zephaniah strained to speak whilst dying. And Diana&#39;s tear 
slipped down from her cheek onto his own, &quot;If... I must... die like 
this... then I am... glad I... at least... got to see... your beautiful 
face again... I only wanted to create a world... where pure, innocent 
people... like you... can live in peace... but it was not to be...&quot;

Diana slowly took up the Knight&#39;s charred hand and brought it to her 
face. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry... I said such horrible things to you... I love you 
so much...&quot;

His hand trembled at her smooth ashen-tone cheek. &quot;...I... love you... 
also... please... never lose... that sparkle of... purity... about 
you... that makes me... feel this way...&quot;

And so the Great Knight Zephaniah took his last breath. Diana watched 
his head fall limp and his heartbeat stop. Dead. Her love was dead. The 
heartbroken Diana went into fresh new sobs as the burning fires around 
her swallowed up the entire courtyard. But she didn&#39;t care if she were 
burned to a crisp along with it. All she was aware of, all she could 
think of, was the fact that the man she loved was dead. 

It tore her apart. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Front Gate, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

As they stood in front of its large metal gate, Ingrid and Lin-Lin 
looked up at the top of Neuschwanstein Castle. It was in flames. And a 
huge tower of smoke was climbing into the sky from it. Ingrid didn&#39;t 
have to be a rocket scientist to know that the Fire Cutter had its hand 
in some of that fire. But what did that mean? Aarin said he was going to 
help with the fight against Zephaniah. Did he get caught up in that mess 
too? Ingrid hated the idea. She couldn&#39;t stand the thought that her 
brother might actually be suffering up there while she could do nothing 
to prevent it. Part of her was actually commanding her to go back into 
the castle and find him. But Ingrid had made a promise to Aarin. That 
she would guard the girl Lin-Lin from harm. It was that promise that 
kept Ingrid from going in there again. By now the flames of the castle 
were now burning on some of the lower levels. 

Lin-Lin gasped. &quot;You don&#39;t think... that the boys might be in trouble... 
do you?&quot;

Ingrid honestly didn&#39;t know. &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Lets hope not.&quot;

But a ray of sunshine hit them in the form of relief. The drawbridge of 
the castle was done. The main archway was unblocked and could be entered 
through easily. The second Ingrid looked at it the archway she was 
filled with joy. As was Lin-Lin. Two small figure appeared from the 
darkness of that burning castle. Setsuya and Aarin. The two fighters, 
bruised, cut and battered, stepped through the archway and towards the 
front gardens that Ingrid and Lin-Lin were waiting in. The sweet 
chocolate eyes of Lin-Lin watered as she saw the tired Setsuya step 
across the drawbridge. She couldn&#39;t believe what this man had done for 
her. He had thrown himself head-first into the hurricane just rescue 
her. Setsuya and Aarin unhurriedly walked up to the girls. And Setsuya 
gave a lazy smile at his Chinese girlfriend. Seeing her for the first 
time in almost eight months. She looked even more cute and pure than she 
did the first time they met. Quite a sight for sore eyes. Knowing that 
she was safe was complete justification for everything he had suffered 
through to get this far.

&quot;Hey there, Lin-Lin,&quot; He said, simply, &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;

Lin-Lin&#39;s smile of joy grew brighter as she ran over to the taller guy 
and wrapped her arms around him eagerly. The girl laughed and cried at 
the same time. To think that she had fallen for a man that was willing 
to suffer to the utmost for her. No set of words could ever present the 
joy and gratefulness she had for Setsuya. The Chinese woman sobbed into 
his strong chest and let it all out.

&quot;Oh, Setsuya...&quot; She said, her voice muffled, &quot;Thank you so much... I 
don&#39;t know what would have happened to me if... you hadn&#39;t...&quot;

The taller Setsuya wrapped his own arms around the shorter Lin-Lin and 
held her in a tight embrace. &quot;It&#39;s okay, Lin-Lin. I&#39;d do anything for 
you. You know that.&quot;

Aarin and Ingrid smiled at the two of them as they held each other. But 
they couldn&#39;t stay here for long. That fire up in Neuschwanstein Castle 
was bound to spread. It was time to leave the Island of Creation. Ten 
Sekai Sentou Kyousou was over. Ingrid looked up at her brother, who by 
now, had his protective arm draped over her shoulder. 

&quot;Is it over?&quot; Ingrid asked him, &quot;Did you take care of it?&quot;

Aarin looked up at the burning castle. &quot;...We stopped the leader. But... 
the actions of the organization...we can&#39;t predict what will happen 
next. But we are safe for now. Let&#39;get out of this wretched place.&quot;
