<h1>Descent: Child of Shadows (part 15 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/descent-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>As a new day dawned the sunlight inched it&#39;s way
across the floor, eventually reaching the figure who
was laying there on the bed. She twitched, shifting,
then finally she opened her eyes, groaning softly.
Descent pushed herself into a sitting position,
wincing as she looked around the strange room in
confusion.

Sam sat in a large chair not far from the bed, the
brown haired priest fast asleep. Her chest rose and
fell, her face oddly peaceful in sleep, a gentleness
apparent there that would never be seen while she was
awake. White bandages swathed her one arm, but other
than that the young woman seemed to be unharmed.

&#39;Good,&#39; Descent thought, gazing for a moment over at
Sam&#39;s still form. She carefully eased herself up out
of the bed, wincing at how stiff she felt, then padded
across the room naked to where a pile of clothes
waited. She could have attempted to create clothes,
but with how weak she felt it probably wasn&#39;t a good
idea.

Thankfully Descent had gotten her pants on when a
faintly amused voice said, &quot;Alex will be relieved to
know you&#39;re up and around.&quot; The woman in the doorway
was beautiful in a lush, almost earthy way and her
smile was gentle as she walked in, long purple hair
falling down her back. &quot;My name is Jasmine,&quot; she
flashed a mildly lecherous grin, &quot;and you&#39;ve been
sleeping in my bed.&quot;

Descent fought back a blush, but at least she didn&#39;t
feel any threat coming from the woman. &quot;Friend of
Alex&#39;s?&quot; she asked softly, looking towards the still
sleeping Sam.

Jasmine kept her voice down, too, her smile much more
gentle. &quot;She&#39;s my lover, yes,&quot; she agreed. Noticing
where Descent&#39;s gaze had gone to she noted, &quot;Sam
hasn&#39;t left your side since we brought you inside.&quot;

&quot;Where are we?&quot; Descent asked, choosing to ignore the
comment about Sam, despite the warm glow it fostered
inside of her.

&quot;The apartments are behind Daughters of Artemis,&quot;
Jasmine explained. She smiled, &quot;The place is famous
for being a neutral location in this crazy city.&quot;

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Descent murmured, shaking her head and
sending her long black hair flowing down her back.

&quot;Urghel,&quot; Sam made a incoherent noise then jerked
awake, looking around wildly before she saw Descent
and Jasmine. &quot;Well,&quot; she visibly shook herself,
getting up out of her chair with a groan, &quot;I&#39;m glad to
see you&#39;re back among the living.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Descent said softly, feeling oddly
confused. She hadn&#39;t really thought that Sam even
liked her much, so it was odd seeing her show such
concern.

&quot;I owed you one for taking that blast for me,&quot; Sam
said abruptly. She looked over at Jasmine, &quot;Jazz, is
there somewhere we can grab some coffee and eats?&quot;

Jasmine shrugged casually, &quot;The Daughters has a pretty
good cook, you could try there.&quot; She studied the two
of them, &quot;Are you going to stick around till Alex gets
back?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Descent admitted.

&quot;It might not be such a good idea,&quot; Sam noted quietly.
She gaze Jasmine a apologetic smile, &quot;The two of us
are trouble, and having us around will put you both in
danger.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think Alex cares about trouble,&quot; Jasmine
said.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Descent said, &quot;but my conscience would bother
me if she our you got hurt because of us.&quot; She looked
over at Sam questioningly as she offered, &quot;Maybe we
can stick around long enough to say thanks and
good-bye?&quot;

&quot;Sounds good,&quot; Sam agreed. She looked shyly at Jasmine
and added, &quot;I wanted to say thank you to you, too.&quot;

Jasmine chuckled throatily, &quot;Alex&#39;ll be paying for it
tonight, trust me.&quot;

&quot;Do I want to know?&quot; Sam asked.

Jasmine&#39;s smile widened, &quot;Probably not.&quot; She pushed
her hair back with a sigh, &quot;Sam you saw the club when
we brought you two in last night, why don&#39;t you two
head over for some food? I&#39;d go with but I need to get
ready for work.&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Descent slipped a borrowed pair of
battered runners on as she and Sam left the upper
floor apartment. &quot;Is it me,&quot; she asked as they walked
down the hall to the battered elevator, &quot;or was she
not human?&quot;

Sam raised an eyebrow as she hit the down button, &quot;How
could you tell?&quot;

&quot;Scent, I think,&quot; Descent answered, &quot;there was just
something slightly off.&quot;

&quot;That was good,&quot; Sam commented as the elevator roughly
descended, &quot;I just ended up seeing her tail when she
got up this morning.&quot;

&quot;Tail?&quot; Descent blinked but Sam just shrugged.

Together they left the lobby and went outside,
following the cement path over to the nightclub that
was set up in the front of the lot. A large building,
it had several cars parked in front and the main doors
were unlocked. Entering the first thing they saw was
the painting of a female archer on the back wall, the
words &#39;Daughters of Artemis&#39; underneath.

&quot;You two must be Alex&#39;s strays,&quot; the woman at the bar
said, the blonde&#39;s smile and tone taking any sting
from her words, &quot;my name is Circe.&quot;

The introductions were quickly made then Sam asked
with her most charming manner, &quot;Any chance of us
getting some breakfast?&quot;

&quot;Athena is around somewhere,&quot; Circe chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll
get you some coffees then see if she can make you up
something.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Descent smiled at her and then the two
walked over to sit down at one of the cleaner little
tables, Circe dropping off two mugs of thick coffee a
few moments later.

Sam waited for Descent to mix up then drink some of
her cup of coffee then she asked seriously, &quot;So how
are you doing?&quot;


&quot;Weak as a kitten,&quot; Descent admitted softly. She took
another drink, &quot;I doubt that I could manage a
shapechange or any other feats, much less fight.&quot;

&quot;I talked to Drake,&quot; Sam&#39;s expression was serious,
&quot;she figured it would be several days before you were
fully recovered.&quot;

&quot;Days?!&quot; Descent blurted, face pale.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Sam nodded, drinking her own coffee while she
considered the situation. She studied Descent for a
moment then said, &quot;You&#39;re going to need to hole up
somewhere, I think, until you&#39;ve fully recovered.&quot;

Descent narrowed her eyes, &quot;I am not going to hide.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not hiding,&quot; Sam shook her head, &quot;it&#39;s giving
yourself the time you need to recover from wounds you
got saving me.&quot; She hesitated, looking down into her
coffee mug then in a very different tone of voice
said, &quot;Thank you, by the way.&quot;

Descent actually felt herself blush a bit, shrugging
uncomfortably. &quot;Reflex,&quot; she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t even
think about it.&quot;

&quot;Which probably makes it even more heroic,
considering,&quot; Sam noted.

Circe bustled up with two plates loaded with sausage,
eggs and hash-browns and sat them down with soft
thumps. There was so much grease and crispy brown bits
that both ladies could feel their arteries panicking
just looking at it.

&quot;Athena got a little enthusiastic,&quot; Circe explained
cheerfully, &quot;there&#39;s seconds in the kitchen once you
work through this.&quot; She paused, hesitating, &quot;Diana and
I established this place as a sanctuary, if you need
to take shelter here a few days....&quot;

&quot;Considering the Lady wants us dead,&quot; Descent said
seriously, &quot;it could bring serious trouble to your
door, ma&#39;am.&quot;

Circe raised a saucy eyebrow, &quot;That&#39;ll just make
things more interesting.&quot; More seriously, &quot;The only
thing is... Lady Diana&#39;s people are welcome here, too.
While you&#39;re under our roof you cannot start anything,
no matter whom you meet.&quot;

Sam looked over at Descent, &quot;I&#39;ve been here before,
it&#39;s not too bad.&quot;

Descent looked at Circe thoughtfully as she
considered. &quot;And if someone decides to take a shot at
me?&quot; she asked pointedly.

&quot;They aren&#39;t that foolish,&quot; Circe said firmly.

&quot;I understand at least one assassin took a shot at
Jess Drake mistakenly,&quot; Sam pointed out, &quot;these men
aren&#39;t that bright.&quot;

Circe just gave a truly unpleasant looking smile,
&quot;Trust me, they will not get another shot.&quot;

To be continued....

Notes: Sam has appeared at Daughters previously, as
have several other characters who have also appeared
in Descent. Some of Sam&#39;s background has also been
hinted at in Daughters, including the fact that she
was a Vietnam vet.</pre>
