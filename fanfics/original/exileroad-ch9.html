<h1>Exile's Road (part 9 of 18)</h1>

<a href="../original/exileroad-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Midori was amused by her companions&#39; surprise, and
even more by the young queen&#39;s amused gaze. Clearly
Gwen didn&#39;t object that badly to her casually offered
suggestion, even though she turned away from that
option for the time being.

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe you said that,&quot; Laur&#39;ien, the
tawny haired young woman tugging a bit uncomfortably
on her maid&#39;s dress.

Midori just ignored that, she and Laur&#39;ien having
moved aside to allow the queen to talk privately with
Jantha. They spoke quietly, dropping their voices to
keep the two bodyguards from hearing and Midori
approved. Too many nobles in her experience forgot
about servants, revealing information that could be
terribly damaging under the right circumstances.

&quot;This place is pretty secure,&quot; Laur&#39;ien noted softly,
her own eyes warily scanning the chamber around them.
With a slight frown she added, &quot;The only thing that
really worries me is someone paying off the guards for
access.&quot;

Midori also looked around them, but she sounded far
less happy as she scolded, &quot;You think too simply,
soldier.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Laur&#39;ien blinked.

Midori discretely looked up at the vaulted ceiling
rising up above them... and to the windows on the
levels far above them. &quot;The Genin are far less likely
to try to come in openly,&quot; she whispered to her
softly, &quot;skulking about in the shadows suits them
better.&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Laur&#39;ien murmured, her slightly narrowed eyes
swiftly taking in all the shadows high above them.

Jantha and the Queen finally separated, then the
lovely blonde called out to them, &quot;And what are you
two plotting?&quot;

&quot;Plotting boarding up your windows, your Majesty,&quot;
Midori bowed as she addressed her words to the young
queen.

&quot;The outside wall is nearly unpassable,&quot; Gwen said to
her confidently, &quot;do you truly believe that assassins
could gain entry?&quot;

&quot;Once upon as time,&quot; Midori said to her dryly, &quot;I
scaled such a building, Majesty, and I know I am less
skilled at such arts than a Genin assassin.&quot; She
paused before continuing, &quot;Tis better to be safe than
sorry, I&#39;d say.&quot;

There was the oddest look on Jantha&#39;s face as she
studied Midori, possibly imagining her trying to scale
the outer wall, then shook herself. &quot;She could have a
point,&quot; she addressed her cousin, &quot;and it costs little
to be wary.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s movement,&quot; Laur&#39;ien&#39;s voice was sharp.

Midori moved over to the throne swiftly, roughly
shoving Jantha behind her and up against the stone
wall where the Queen sat up in surprise. &quot;Your eyes
are a bit better than mine then,&quot; Midori said gruffly,
&quot;I don&#39;t see....&quot;

The knife arched out from the darkness and without
even thinking about it Midori slapped the weapon from
the air with her staff. Laur&#39;ien drew her knives from
somewhere beneath her maid&#39;s dress, her expression
grim, &quot;I only saw him because he moved.&quot;

&quot;My error, then,&quot; he said as he slipped into the torch
light. The black the man wore was a dull color,
intended to absorb the light, even as the coal that
painted his face did and he moved with a sinister
grace, sliding not walking.

&quot;Leave this place, now,&quot; Gwen commanded, her young
voice full of royal authority.

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I cannot do that,&quot; his voice sounded
almost respectful, &quot;the price on the Duchess Jantha
remains uncollected.&quot; He drew another knife, &quot;If your
warriors would care to step aside, I&#39;ll make it as
painless as possible.&quot;

&quot;I would not be an oathbreaker, scum,&quot; Midori said to
him coldly, her eyes narrowed in anger. She didn&#39;t
hear an accent in the man&#39;s voice, he was clearly from
her homeland, but she couldn&#39;t quite place his
dialect.

The assassin&#39;s eyes widened at hearing the way she
shaped her words, then he studied her face intently.
&quot;Why do you risk yourself to protect these gaijin?&quot; he
demanded in surprise, speaking in the language that
they both shared.

&#39;From the northlands,&#39; Midori finally nailed where he
was from. &quot;I gave my word,&quot; she repeated, &quot;that is
enough, I think.&quot; She looked at him as she put the
weight of authority in her own words, &quot;This is not our
land and people, assassin, leave here.&quot;

&quot;I too have given my word,&quot; he stiffened, &quot;and my
guild, too.&quot; With a slightly regretful shrug he added,
&quot;We will not be forsworn.&quot;

&quot;Do either of you understand any of that?&quot; Gwen
demanded harshly.

&quot;Bits and pieces,&quot; Laur&#39;ien surprised them by
answering, &quot;she told him she&#39;s not leaving us to his
tender mercies, basically.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Jantha murmured.

The assassin charged, knives gleaming in each hand but
Midori was ready, catching one blade on her staff even
as she grabbed a hold of his other arm. Yanking him
off balance she used a old bar fighting trick and
slammed her head into his, stunning the killer a
moment.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Laur&#39;ien cursed under her breath as Midori
and the assassin really got into it, knives and staff
almost a blur.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you helping?&quot; Gwen demanded.

&quot;I don&#39;t dare,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said, frustration in her
voice, &quot;if I jump in he could turn my attack against
Midori, or I may simply get in her way.&quot;

The staff spun in Midori&#39;s hands, the warrior moving
like she was dancing as she fought. She was always
centered, balanced, while still ready to face whatever
he dared to bring against her. More and more the
killer seemed confused, frustrated that his strikes
couldn&#39;t get through.

They drew back for a moment, staring at each other
warily as they circled each other. &quot;You&#39;ve been
trained well,&quot; the assassin finally admitted, &quot;I would
almost wonder if you were not one of our guild
yourself.&quot;

&quot;You flatter yourself,&quot; Midori answered coldly, her
staff and fighting stance angled to reveal as few of
her vulnerable points as possible, &quot;I was merely
trained to protect from one such as you.&quot; She conceded
reluctantly, &quot;You are good, tho.&quot;

&quot;Will you yield?&quot; he asked optimistically.

&quot;No,&quot; Midori took hold of the end of her heavy oaken
staff and twisted it, just slightly, then with a hiss
drew the concealed, slim sword from the wooden sheath.
The straight, gleaming blade shone in the torch light,
a watermark shimmering along it&#39;s well balanced
length, a stylized emblem engraved near the hilt.

The assassin hesitated, gazing at the sword and it&#39;s
wielder then smiled just slightly. &quot;That isn&#39;t easy to
craft,&quot; he said, &quot;and that symbol.. he only crafted
swords for nobility.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to chide my guards for not searching
Midori,&quot; Gwen commented into the silence, giving her
cousin a look.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; Jantha admitted.

Laur&#39;ien watched, her eyes intent as she studied the
two warriors. &quot;Midori is a better swordswoman than I
thought,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I think we&#39;re saved.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Gwen said grimly.

Midori moved without warning, sword flashing but the
assassin was simply gone, leaping into the shadows.
&quot;We&#39;ll play this game again,&quot; he called as he used a
cable to swiftly climb up to one of the upper story
windows.

&quot;Get back here,&quot; Midori growled, running forward to
grab at the cable but he cut it with one of his
knives, sending the unused portion to fall on her.

&quot;Not today swordlady,&quot; he crouched in the window.
Oddly he bowed slightly, &quot;I&#39;m honored to face one such
as you, lord.&quot; And with that he was gone.

&quot;We are definitely boarding up those windows,&quot;
Laur&#39;ien sighed with disgust.

Midori sheathed her sword then twisted, locking the
weapon within her staff even as she walked back to
their side. &quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; she demanded, her
eyes falling on Jantha.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Jantha looked up to meet her eyes, &quot;thanks to
you.&quot;

Gwen sat on her throne, remarkably calm as she looked
at Midori intently and said, &quot;I too owe you my life,
m&#39;lady.&quot;

&quot;Just doing my duty,&quot; Midori answered coolly.</pre>
