<a href="../original/angelgift-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>&quot;The tracer that I put on Jenna,&quot; Milly&#39;s face was pale as she picked 
the device off the ground, turning the disk over thoughtfully.

&quot;They&#39;re gone?&quot; Sharin blurted, her expression dangerous. The tall 
blonde had summoned her battle armor, looking like some kind of goddess 
of war without a battle to fight.

Milly&#39;s eyes were dark with surpressed anger, the redheaded catgirl&#39;s 
hair standing up slightly as she gazed towards the sky. &quot;Slip-transit,&quot; 
she murmured, &quot;but to where?&quot;

Sharin tapped her wristband, a holographic image floating just above the 
silvery band. She studied the readings before reporting, &quot;A ship in 
orbit, the energy signature from the transit matches that of an Empire 
vessel.&quot;

&quot;So they&#39;ve decided to send the military after the Princess,&quot; Milly 
growled, &quot;we&#39;ve got to go after them!&quot;

&quot;And if we do, what then?&quot; Sharin said firmly. &quot;If there&#39;s a Dreadnought 
or Star Destroyer up there we&#39;d be slaughtered on our own,&quot; she 
commented.

&quot;I am not leaving my Princess in their hands,&quot; Milly glared.

&quot;We&#39;re not going to,&quot; Sharin said, &quot;but we need to get the others 
together.&quot;

Milly hesitated, then nodded, &quot;All right.&quot; Sharin picked her up bodily, 
bringing forth a startled squeak. &quot;What are you...&quot;

&quot;Hold on tight,&quot; Sharin rose up into the air, &quot;we&#39;re taking a short 
cut.&quot; With that she took off straight up, then soared towards Jenna&#39;s 
apartment building.

Milly had her arms around Sharin&#39;s neck, her face pressed towards the 
woman&#39;s collar as she tried desperately not to look down. A faint blush 
stole over her face as she realized how close their bodies were, how 
pleasant it was to feel Jenna pressed to her like that.

&quot;We&#39;re here,&quot; Sharin said as they settled down on the balcony, for a 
moment wishing the flight had been a bit longer.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Milly bolted for the patio door, stepping inside and looking 
around for the others.

&quot;Welcome home,&quot; Roma said, the Galactic Patrol android calmly preparing 
something for dinner. Amara, Kat and Marilyn were sitting at the dining 
table, obviously waiting to eat.

&quot;You&#39;re back early,&quot; Marilyn beamed.

&quot;We&#39;ve got trouble,&quot; Sharin started.

&quot;Jenna and Allison have been kidnapped,&quot; Milly hissed.

Amara sat up from her casual posture, her eyes narrowing with anger. 
&quot;And you two didn&#39;t stop it?&quot; she demanded fiercely.

&quot;They were slip-transited away,&quot; Sharin kept her voice even, despite her 
own flash of temper, &quot;there was nothing we could do.&quot;

Marilyn asked crisply, &quot;Do we know what sort of vessel it was?&quot; The 
slightly goofy manner the blue haired woman usually had was gone, 
replaced by efficiency.

&quot;An Empire vessel,&quot; Milly offered. She frowned, the redheaded catgirl&#39;s 
tail lashing back and forth, &quot;We&#39;ve got to find a way to get up 
there....&quot;

&quot;I can get us into orbit,&quot; Amara offered, the black haired woman pulling 
on her heavy leather overcoat. From various hidden pockets she produced 
various weapons before putting them back.

&quot;And how can you do that?&quot; Kat blinked, pushing her brown hair back 
worriedly.

&quot;I kind of... acquired an Empire combat shuttle,&quot; Amara explained with a 
grin.

&quot;Acquired?&quot; Roma raised an eyebrow, the android frowning slightly. 
&quot;Those are never released unless to be scrapped, how did you....&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t ask questions you don&#39;t want to hear the answers for,&quot; Sharin 
advised. She looked at Amara, &quot;Will it seat us all?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Amara shrugged. She looked over at Kat, &quot;But I&#39;m not sure 
if....&quot;

&quot;Allison&#39;s my best friend,&quot; Kat said firmly, &quot;of course I&#39;m coming 
along.&quot; She set her hands on her hips to add, &quot;And there&#39;s no way you&#39;re 
talking me out of it.&quot;

&quot;If she want&#39;s to go,&quot; Milly said, &quot;she can go.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Sharin said, &quot;we need to get to the Princess and 
Allison as soon as possible.&quot;

The group left the penthouse together, following Amara across the city 
into the bad side of town. Jack looked up as Amara entered their office, 
the woman&#39;s eyes widening as the group followed her in. &quot;Friends of 
yours?&quot; the redheaded woman asked, suddenly holding a shotgun on the 
group.

&quot;Put the gun up,&quot; Amara advised her with a grin, &quot;they really are 
friends of mine.&quot; She looked back at Sharin thoughtfully, &quot;And I doubt a 
gun would work, honestly.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s up?&quot; Jack asked, putting the gun away reluctantly.

&quot;Friend of ours has been kidnapped, maybe,&quot; Amara said as she led the 
others towards the door in the far wall, &quot;we&#39;re going to ride to the 
rescue.&quot;

&quot;The shuttle,&quot; Jack made a face. &quot;All right, it&#39;s been refueled and I 
think the weapons are fully charged. Just don&#39;t do too much property 
damage this time,&quot; she complained.

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Amara waved. &quot;I&#39;ll be back when I&#39;m back.&quot;

They entered a darkened stairway, walking down into deeper darkness. 
Sharin&#39;s hands glowed, lighting up the shadows as she said, &quot;No light 
bulbs?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want strangers wandering down here,&quot; Amara said dryly.

They entered into a large chamber, lights triggering automatically as 
they went in. The vessel that crouched there was twelve feet tall and 
nearly twice as long. The engineering module was the largest, the 
vehicle tapering off to a pointed nose-cone. Wing surfaces stretched out 
on each side, coupled with weapons mounts on the top and bottom of the 
slim vessel. The access ramp was extended down, along with the slim legs 
that held it a foot off the floor.

&quot;Where did you get a new combat shuttle?&quot; Sharin murmured, taking in the 
glossy sheen of the deadly looking small craft.

&quot;An Admiral was lining her pockets,&quot; Amara said dryly, &quot;selling fleet 
tech to privateers. I helped shut her down, but not before picking this 
little lovely up.&quot;

Amara led the way inside, heading towards the cockpit up front. &quot;I&#39;ll 
take the scanners,&quot; Roma offered, &quot;I can interface to improve their 
efficiency.&quot;

&quot;Go for it,&quot; Amara nodded. She looked at the others, &quot;Any of you good 
pilots?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not bad at it,&quot; Sharin offered calmly, &quot;why?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to take the tactical station,&quot; Amara said dryly, &quot;just in case 
we need the weapons up there. You mind taking the helm?&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Sharin said, looking the controls over. She pulled a data 
module from her wristband and passed it to Roma, &quot;I got scan data on the 
slip-transit energies, you can use it to track Allison and Jenna.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Roma said before plugging the module into the control 
panel, modifying the sensors as she went.

&quot;So how are we going to get above ground?&quot; Marilyn asked a bit 
nervously.

&quot;There&#39;s a route preprogrammed into the helm,&quot; Amara said as she sat 
down at tactical, &quot;it takes us out via an old subway tunnel.&quot; She looked 
back at the others, &quot;Grab seats and strap yourselves in, it can be kinda 
rough.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Kat sat herself down, securing the belts carefully.

Sharin pressed the engage key, the ship rumbling a bit as it rose up 
another foot. It wobbled a moment, then shot off into the darkness. They 
skimmed down a tunnel at breakneck speed, arching up towards the surface 
then seemingly exploding from the ground into the night sky.

&quot;Could we go back for my stomach, please?&quot; Milly whimpered.

Sharin ignored that, the vehicle swiftly rising up above the city. The 
land receded behind them, the sky filling the viewscreen. In less time 
than it took to tell the effects of gravity began to be felt less and 
less, the view outside shifting from the cloudy sky to the darkness and 
twinkling stars.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Kat murmured softly.

Amara smiled slightly at that, &#39;Guess this is her first time.&#39; She 
looked over at Roma to ask, &quot;Are you picking up anything?&quot;

&quot;A moment,&quot; Roma&#39;s eyes were oddly unfocused, a cable extending from her 
wrist to connect to the controls. &quot;Got it, transferring coordinates to 
navigation,&quot; she said.

Sharin smoothly changed their course, bringing the ship along the new 
vector. &quot;If they&#39;re following standard procedure for a pre-spaceflight 
culture they&#39;re using a cloak,&quot; she noted, &quot;can you put scan data on the 
screen for me?&quot; The data appeared and she smiled, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Marilyn asked them curiously, &quot;does anyone have any idea what 
we&#39;re supposed to do once we find them?&quot;

&quot;Improvise,&quot; Amara said dryly. &quot;We have no idea if it&#39;s the military, 
mercenaries or bounty hunters that grabbed them, so without more 
info...&quot; she shrugged.

&quot;Nearing coordinates,&quot; Sharin reported.

&quot;We&#39;re being hailed,&quot; Roma noted.

&quot;Put it on screen,&quot; both Sharin and Amara ordered at the same time.

Jenna smiled out of the screen, a smile on her beautiful face. &quot;I knew 
you&#39;d find a way to get up here,&quot; she said cheerfully, &quot;the captain will 
open up a docking bay.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Milly growled, her red tail lashing irritably.

&quot;Long story,&quot; Jenna sighed. &quot;Come aboard and we&#39;ll talk.&quot;</pre>
