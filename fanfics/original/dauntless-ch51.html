<p>“The Green Lady of New Avalon: noble goals?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Sharyn’s request to visit her homeworld of New Avalon  would soon be honored. Not surprisingly, Lyara had been a great  supporter of the green-skinned warrior’s quest to restore her  people’s civilization to glory, so she was looking forward to this  just as much as Sharyn— who, at the moment, stood with the  dignified solemnity that is so greatly romanticized in her kind. She  wore full battle regalia and had her red hair tied up with ribbons  and bands; her sword had been cleaned and even Gwen, her irritating  but seldom-seen observer droid, sparkled like new for their arrival.  Lyara stood by Sharyn’s side and subtly clasped her hand as the <em>Dauntless </em>drew nearer to the impoverished world.</p>
<p>“I think I may have found where the third treasure is  located,” she murmured. Sharyn did not speak; her mind was  elsewhere. “If you’d like, we can visit the Helios system and  search around. I’m almost certain it’s on Gaea.” Lyara loved  Sharyn, and could sense her emotions better than she could anyone  else’s; they were bonded for better and for worse by cords too thin  to see and too powerful to cut. “Are you all right, Shar? You don’t  have to be nervous. I <em>am</em> with you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, pardon me,” she said at last, removing herself  from her daze. “I was lost in thought. Aye, Gaea it is, then. My  people will be most exuberant. Prithee tell me, hast thou family?”</p>
<p>“No biological relatives, I’m afraid,” she  replied. “Only this gang I led for awhile back on Avatar. As far as  I know, Aseria’s the nearest relative I have.”</p>
<p>“To have such a harpy as her for kin sounds  discomforting,” she replied, smiling grimly. She clasped her sword  as the <em>Dauntless </em>entered New Avalon’s atmosphere, and turned  around so she could be held in Lyara’s arms. Lyara didn’t say a  word; she simply stroked the brave woman’s hair.</p>
<p>“Ready whenever you are,” said Kay, poking her head  in suddenly. She blushed and jerked back. “Whoops! Are we  interrupting anything?”</p>
<p>“You should’ve knocked first,” Tee grumbled.  Sharyn withdrew and composed herself.</p>
<p>“Nay, we needed but a moment. I thank thee for  alerting us.”</p>
<p>“Anytime. Mind if we stretch our legs and look  around?”</p>
<p>“All aboard are invited, but do not expect a pleasant  welcome.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“This is the most pleasant welcome I’ve ever had!”  Kayleigh exclaimed as flower blossoms were thrown in the air. Music  sounded, the aroma of good food swam in the air, children played,  people danced, and the light shined bright. New Avalon certainly  wasn’t as disheveled as she had been led to believe.</p>
<p>“Yes, a little too pleasant,” her sister grumbled.  “Something’s not right here. Either Sharyn’s out of touch, or  we’re being set up.”</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>“Out of touch, you say?”</p>
<p>“In any case,” Teleah coughed, “we may as well  accept their hospitality.” It wasn’t just the welcoming committee  that seemed out of place: nearly all of New Avalon was alive with  color and vitality. There were acres of picturesque farmland crowned  by magnificent castles, mountains of purest sapphire with crystalline  peaks in the distance, the soft singing of forests in the wind, and  everywhere, the signs of prosperity borne of hard labor and strong  will. The people all had exotic skin colors— not just green, but  yellow, blue, red, orange, stark white, gray, black, and hundreds of  hues in between— and they all spoke in the same antiquated fashion  Sharyn used, even the children. It became obvious fairly quickly that  something was amiss, and all eyes turned to Sharyn, demanding an  answer.</p>
<p>“So, poverty and plagues, huh? Your people on the  verge of starvation, did you say? And correct us if we’re wrong,  but you said they were all desperate and poor. So what happened,  Sharyn?”</p>
<p>“I offered thee no false testament, friends, I assure  thee. A moment of your time, if ye will.” She sent Gwen off in a  westerly direction and relaxed her shoulders; her sword returned to  her side and she unclasped her armor, relaxing a little. “Well, I’m  licked,” she stated. “They must’ve gone through with the whole,  ‘Oh, we don’t need enchanted items of vast and dangerous power to  help us, we can repair New Avalon on our own!’ Of course, it’s  just as likely that a wizard did it.”</p>
<p>“Um, Sharyn?” Lyara murmured, feeling puzzled.</p>
<p>“Another suggestion is that these people might not be  MY people, and we simply got lost. If this planet weren’t riddled  with labyrinthine passages designed by drunken godless heathens  kicked out of architecture school for their propositions of <em>lunacy</em>,  I might be able to get my bearings! Now that I think about it, this  looks suspiciously like the NON-plagued town that offered us handouts  we were too proud to turn down. Alas, hindsight is such a merciless  teacher…”</p>
<p>“You know,” Naja said to Lyara, “this suddenly  explains so much that I’m not even going to dignify it with a  death-threat. …Yet.”</p>
<p>“What the hell’s going on, Sharyn?” Lyara  demanded. “I thought you said New Avalon was suffering! I thought  you went on a quest to save them and prove yourself! <em>I thought you  could talk like fucking Shakespeare!</em> WHAT THE HELL!”</p>
<p>“You already said that,” Kate reminded her. Sharyn  turned to Lyara and shrugged casually.</p>
<p>“You don’t seriously believe I talk like that all  the <em>time</em>, do you? That’s hard work! I’m only supposed to  represent New Avalon when I’m abroad, so it’s not like I have to  act like a princess when I’m at home— if this really is home.”</p>
<p>“So we’re lost.”</p>
<p>“It’s an almost certain possibility. I distinctly  recall the suffering. Ah, Gwen’s come back! Maybe now we’ll get  an answer to these puzzling…uh, puzzles!”</p>
<p>“(You might want to reconsider your romantic  pursuits, elf-girl!)” Valti whispered. “(Something tells me that  girl ain’t right.)”</p>
<p>“I swore I’d stay by her side,” she insisted,  angry though she was. In the meantime…</p>
<p>“Gwen! Is this New Avalon?”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“Strange. Are we on the opposite side of the world?”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“Obviously she’s malfunctioning!”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“Curse your metallic bones!”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“SHUT UP! Where’s my family? Aren’t they with the  other suffering people?”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“There aren’t people suffering anywhere on this  world, are there, Gwen?” Lyara called.</p>
<p>[Yes,] it replied.</p>
<p>“So…there are?”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“See, I told you! I’m not crazy or lost after all!”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“Malfunctioning,” she cackled, trying to dismantle  the devious machine, “it’s clearly malfunctioning! This thing’s  broken— that’s the only explanation! Yeah!”</p>
<p>“That’s not the only thing that’s broken,”  Herut muttered. She sighed and decided to see what she could do to  help. A mechanic Sharyn was not.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>It turns out that the only “people” who were under  any kind of stress were Sharyn’s immediate relatives and neighbors,  and only because SOMEONE kept forgetting to pay the water bill (no  names were suggested but everyone knew who it was). It seemed that  Sharyn was a little too eager for her own good, and she liked to  exaggerate and blow things out of proportion. Fortunately, by the  time she found her hometown, the water supply was back on, the  perpetrator severely slapped on the wrist, and all was fair and good  in New Avalon forever.</p>
<p>OR SO THEY THOUGHT! DUN-DUN-DUNN!!</p>
<p>“Was that really necessary?” Lil muttered. Aseria  elbowed her.</p>
<p>“Honey, you’re breaking the fourth wall.”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for making you all so concerned,”  Sharyn said to her gathered crewmates. “The truth is that my family  lineage is one of the proudest in New Avalon, and I couldn’t bear  the shame of not living up to their name. I know it sounds naïve of  me, but I thought a journey of self-discovery was in order. The three  items I had been searching for <em>do</em> bring prosperity, but they  were not vital to my goals. I simply needed something tangible to  shoot for.”</p>
<p>“That sounds perfectly reasonable,” Amy said. “I  think we should forgive her. She’s still young, and the passions of  youth can be misleading.”</p>
<p>“I suppose it would be the proper thing to do,”  Allegra admitted grudgingly. “But if you keep lyin’ to us, honey,  you’re gonna run outta friends.”</p>
<p>“I know, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“So New Avalon was never in any danger, was it?”</p>
<p>“Oh no, no, far from it! I mean, economically  speaking, we’ve never been better! It’s forces from outside that  doth plague us so!”</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she murmured sheepishly. “When I get all  riled up, it just slips out.”</p>
<p>“That’s perfectly believable, albeit bizarre,”  Yenae replied. “So what kind of force are we talking about? Like,  weak, super-weak, pathetic, double-pathetic…?”</p>
<p>“More like <em>impossible</em>!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Are you referring to the Void Dragons?” Lyara  said.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s exactly right! They live on another  planet and strive to harass us! They’ve been our mortal enemies  ever since we came here and drove them away!”</p>
<p>“(Might explain something,)” Naja muttered.</p>
<p>“They descend from the sky with big pointy claws of  perilous death and breathe fire of unspeakable inconvenience! I mean,  just <em>imagine</em> how long we had to go without paying the water  bill, just so we could fight those fires!”</p>
<p>“(And so the pieces come together,)” Lil grumbled.</p>
<p>“They’re also as clever as snakes and harder to  kill than roaches! They breathe poisonous fumes and shoot hot lasery  death from their eye sockets!”</p>
<p>“Now you’re just making it up!” Naja said,  indignated.</p>
<p>“No, seriously, just ask my noble father! He’s an  expert on these matters! He’s confronted the Void Dragons and their  sinister Queen more times than anybody!”</p>
<p>“So where is the old guy?” Lil said. She pointed to  something descending from the sky and said, “Is that him, the  suspicious figure silhouetted in the distance, the one that looks  less like a human and more like a dragon?”</p>
<p>“No, he’d be in the fields now with mother, trying  to irrigate our WAHHUUUAAATT?” Sharyn jerked around, drawing her  sword, but her efforts were put to waste as the dragon-shaped figure,  which could not possibly be a Void Dragon until somebody identified  it as thus, waved its arm and thrust the weapon out of her hand. Uh,  with magic or something.</p>
<p>“So, the little green freak decided to come back! And  she brought some friends as well! But I have friends, too, and this  time, I’ll be sure to capture and sacrifice ALL the virgins!  Aaahahahahahaha— ”</p>
<p>“Hold it, chuckles!” Alala shouted. “Just give us  a moment to catch up, all right?! We can only have so much  information stuffed down our throats.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sorry— I just got so carried away!”</p>
<p>“It happens,” she shrugged. Now that that  unpleasantness was over with, everyone could see their new nemesis.  She wasn’t so much a dragon as a human with a tail, horns, wings,  and some scales— and an unusually attractive crossbreed at that.  Sharyn didn’t tell her friends this (she had a bad habit of leaving  vital information out of the loop), but most Void Dragons could  nearly pass as humans if it weren’t for the…well, for the  “additions”. Admittedly, some of them were enormous lizards  capable of destroying mountains and laying waste to entire nations in  a single night, but most of them were of reasonable size, and this  fine lady was one of them.</p>
<p>“So you’re a Void Dragon,” Lyara pointed, “and  it seems you two know each other.”</p>
<p>“Aye, that foul temptress is cursed with the name of  Diana, and no wickeder foe hath I ever crossed paths with!”</p>
<p>Pause.</p>
<p>“It slipped again.”</p>
<p>“Evidently,” Alala noted. “Now before we all  start making threats, swearing on our ancestors, or whatever it is  you Medieval Fair rejects do, let’s find out what Diana the Void  Dragon wants.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Diana bowed. “My needs are few and  my demands reasonable. I simply want to capture every virgin in the  world, including the King’s hot independent rebellious tomboy  daughter, and sacrifice them to my unholy god of general nastiness so  that we can finally get free television transmissions.”</p>
<p>“You would slaughter innocent maidens for that?!”  Sharyn screamed.</p>
<p>Actually, we’ve been hitting the sci-fi conventions  for the past few centuries. You wouldn’t <em>believe</em> how  difficult it is to find a <em>female</em> virgin!”</p>
<p>“(Tell me about it,)” Chandra muttered. Diana  resumed undaunted.</p>
<p>“When my people found out that a ship full of women  was coming here, naturally we were on it like ants! I mean, there’s  got to be like, at least twenty virgins in your crew!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’d think that, wouldn’t you?” Eve  muttered. “I mean, I’m a misanthropic sociopath who prefers  machines over people, and I <em>still</em> got laid by four different  women!”</p>
<p>“I was number four,” Kyrie squealed.</p>
<p>“Well, that still leaves nineteen!” Diana would  soon discover, however, that there were slim pickings aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>. Nobody was surprised at all when she pulled Vimmy  out of the ranks— apparently she knew a virgin when she saw one—  but a few people snickered when she plucked Alala as well.</p>
<p>“Hey, get your greasy dragon hands off me! Damn it,  I’m a Felinis! I’m not supposed to be a twenty year-old virgin!”</p>
<p>“And yet here we are,” Herut said. Mink and Shana  were with them— apparently they did <em>not</em> go all the way that  fateful evening— and even Yenae was thrown in, to everyone’s  surprise.</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t look so shocked,” she mumbled. “I’m  obviously saving myself for my darling fluffy bums!”</p>
<p>“Don’t get your hopes up!” Alala snarled. Diana  paused as she came to Amy Miracle— everybody knew she would capture  her immediately— but she passed her over and, surprisingly, picked  Lyara up off the ground.</p>
<p>“Holy fuck!” Naja screamed. “You’ve gotta be <em>shitting</em> me! There’s no way that prude little nun ever got  laid!”</p>
<p>“Actually…” Amy blushed deeply and tried not to  look too proud. “Uh, without going into detail, let’s just say  that Kyle and I were <em>very</em> close during college.”</p>
<p>There was perfect silence on New Avalon as everyone,  even Chandra, stood there with their mouths hanging open.</p>
<p>“Yes, we certainly went at it like rabbits!”</p>
<p>Cough.</p>
<p>“Sometimes more than once a day!”</p>
<p>Still gaping, folks.</p>
<p>“I even got to experiment with two guys at once! That  was a real trip!”</p>
<p>“Okay, I think you’re finished blowing our minds,”  Lil grumbled.</p>
<p>“Damn,” Naja whispered. “It’s always the one  you least suspect.”</p>
<p>“Which is also why I have to pass you over,” Diana  said to Sharyn. So in the end, she only found seven virgins in a crew  of twenty-four women: Alala, Yenae, Herut, Shana, Mink, Vimmy, and  Lyara (Rachel didn’t count).</p>
<p>“Wait, <em>what</em>?” Lyara blurted sharply. “You  mean <em>you’re not a virgin</em>, Sharyn?”</p>
<p>The green-skinned warrior blushed horribly. “Uh,  yeah, umm, about that…”</p>
<p>“I don’t even have to use my powers of perception  on her, if you know what I mean!” Diana remarked, flipping her hair  as she turned around to leave. Lyara suddenly turned a little green  herself.</p>
<p>“There is so much wrong with this, and by that, I  mean that everything’s wrong.”</p>
<p>“Hey, what are we standing around for?!” Allegra  roared, pulling her rifle from her pack. “They may be virgins, but  they’re still our friends! We can’t let Bitch-osaurus Rex haul  em’ off!”</p>
<p>“We heard that, ya know!” Alala screamed.</p>
<p>“Allegra’s right!” Naja shouted. “If anybody’s  going to be ‘taking care’ of those virgins, it’s me! Come get  some, you fairy tale reject!”</p>
<p>“Suddenly, a rescue doesn’t sound so attractive,”  Mink muttered. Diana laughed at their feeble attempts, because she  knew she had an ace up her sleeve.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! I laugh at your feeble attempts, because I  have an ace up my sleeve!”</p>
<p>“Is there an echo in here?” Rachel wondered.</p>
<p>“Fourth wall!” Aseria coughed. Diana snapped her  fingers, and from out of the distance came a large ugly green troll!</p>
<p>“Behold, my mightiest ally, Sexually Ambiguous Troll!  Sexually Ambiguous Troll, make them wish they were never born! C-ya!”  And with that extremely weird introduction, Diana the half-Void  Dragon rushed off with seven virgins in tow, heading straight for the  King’s castle so she could make her collection complete!</p>
<p>“That was strange,” Kay said.</p>
<p>“Not as strange as this,” Tee pointed, indicating  the dreaded Sexually Ambiguous Troll.</p>
<p>“Hi, ladies!” he (she?) lisped. “Does anybody  have any cheese doodles? I hope not, cuz’ god— the temptation!  Talk about a one-way ticket to thunder thighs! So let’s dish on the  latest celebrity slut scandals! I hear that Captain Chuunaru slept  with a pleasure unit— a FEMALE pleasure unit! Oooh, delicious!”</p>
<p>“I refuse to listen to these baseless allegations!”  Chandra shouted. Fuuka and Athena held each other for comfort,  shivering under the beady little eyes of Sexually Ambiguous Troll.</p>
<p>“This is the greatest disaster we’ve ever had to  face, Fuu-chan.”</p>
<p>“I know, hold me closer.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>For the first time ever, the ladies of the <em>Dauntless </em>could no longer live up to their name, but considering they were  up against Sexually Ambiguous Troll, their retreat could be forgiven.  Fortunately, he (she?) didn’t pursue them very far, so they managed  to regroup in the town square. Sharyn knew that the <em>Dauntless </em>crew  would not be enough to defeat Sexually Ambiguous Troll and Diana, or  rescue the eight virgins (among them the King’s daughter, Princess  Hot Independent Rebellious Tomboy): they would need the help of New  Avalon’s Three Miughty Champions ™.</p>
<p>“Who are these three you speak of?” Fuuka asked.</p>
<p>“One of them is my father, the noble dragoon and  chief adversary of the Void Dragons. They call him Sir Lance the  Dragonslayer. The other two are the mighty cleric Benjamin, who is  said to possess incredible healing powers, and Shawn the rogue, fast  as a hawk with hands capable of pilfering anything. They are all  close friends who have been on many adventures together. I would  trust no one else to accomplish this mission.”</p>
<p>“We are here, you know,” Athena muttered. Sharyn  flinched.</p>
<p>“I mean, accomplish it <em>with</em> you, of course.  Heheheh!”</p>
<p>Cough.</p>
<p>“Riiiiiiiiight.” Sharyn’s father was as  courteous, strong, brave, and beautiful as his daughter, without the  ditzy naiveté or the overbearing pride. He was a seasoned warrior  who had seen it all, with a few scars to prove it. He knelt before  the ladies, smiling warmly, making more than one of them swoon.</p>
<p>“Sir Lance Thrustwell at thy service, fairest ones,”  he proclaimed. “I have battled the Void Dragons many times. No one  is as well-versed in their villainy as— ”</p>
<p>“Hold that thought, skippy,” Lil said. She turned  to Sharyn and squeaked, “Thrustwell? <em>Seriously</em>?!” More  than a few women snickered; Amy’s face turned very red as a huge  smile creased on her mouth.</p>
<p>“Aye. Pray tell what humor you see in that.”</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing!” she sang. “It just  sounds…penetrating, is all.”</p>
<p>They couldn’t hold it in anymore: everyone burst out  laughing.</p>
<p>“I don’t understand,” Sharyn said.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re not a virgin, hon?” Allegra  wondered. The crew managed to calm down after awhile, but they  started snickering once the other two heroes arrived. Shawn was as  devilishly handsome and androgynous as you’d expect a master thief  to be, but the thing is, well…</p>
<p>“Ooh, treasure!”</p>
<p>POOF!</p>
<p>“Aw, not again!” Everyone stood agape as he  transformed from a sexy androgynous man into a sexy androgynous  woman. And here they thought this adventure couldn’t get any  weirder.</p>
<p>“Well, there’s something you don’t see every  day,” Kyrie whispered.</p>
<p>“Clearly the result of a curse!” Rachel crowed.  Fuuka gasped for joy and was about to squeal something anime-related,  but Athena stopped her.</p>
<p>“No, Fuu-chan.”</p>
<p>“But— ”</p>
<p>“<em>No</em>, honey. Not this time.”</p>
<p>“Aww.”</p>
<p>“And this is Lord Benjamin, cleric extraordinaire,”  Lance said.</p>
<p>“But she’s a woman,” Kate pointed. “And she  looks really buff for a cleric.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m LIVING PROOF that there IS  such thing as a strong male white mage— who has dark skin! And I’m  really good at what I do!”</p>
<p>“But you’re clearly a woman,” Chandra said. “I  can see your breasts.”</p>
<p>“Why are you staring in the first place?!”</p>
<p>“She does that,” Athena said as she shoved the  pervert out of the way. “Look, quirks aside, we need to rescue  everyone. Can you three defeat Diana and Sexually Ambiguous Troll?”</p>
<p>“Well, I am a master of stealing hearts!”</p>
<p>“I’ll pummel them with my MANLY STRENGTH!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ruth, you’re very masculine.”</p>
<p>“BENJAMIN!” she (he?) roared.</p>
<p>“And I shall wield my spear and penetrate through  their defenses with a solid, thrusting motion! I’ll pierce straight  through and I won’t stop until they submit to my invincible  drilling attack!”</p>
<p>“Father is so wonderful,” Sharyn sighed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, and totally not a pervert in any fashion  whatsoever,” Naja groaned. Amy wiped her glasses, which had fogged  over several times ever since meeting the Dragonslayer.</p>
<p>“Whew! Uh, I think I need to take a cold shower. You  guys go on ahead.”</p>
<p>“With gusto!” Lance sang.</p>
<p>“See, she called me a guy! That means I’m a guy!”  Benjamin crowed.</p>
<p>POOF!</p>
<p>“Damn it, my chances for HLS have been foiled again!  Curse my sticky fingers!”</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to miss the Necropolis,” Allegra  muttered.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Comfortable?” Diana said to her eight captives.</p>
<p>“Yes, actually,” Shana replied. “Suspiciously  so.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have an ulterior motive!” Diana  exclaimed suddenly. Shana was taken aback.</p>
<p>“I never said you did.”</p>
<p>“Wow, awkward,” Herut said. Diana grinned  innocently.</p>
<p>“Oh, heheh, of course not! Who wants cookies?”</p>
<p>“Ooh, ooh, ooh! I do, I do! Me-me-me!”</p>
<p>“Okay, you girls, one at a time,” she chuckled  warmly. “Sexually Ambiguous Troll, is the next batch ready?”</p>
<p>“Almost! I just need to add the sugary pink  frosting!”</p>
<p>“Excellent! Bwahaha! We can’t wage a war without  sugary pink frosting!”</p>
<p>“Who’s waging the what now?” Herut blurted. Diana  smiled at her sweetly.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that I spout random nonsense from  time to time.”</p>
<p>“Sounds credible,” she shrugged.</p>
<p>“You know,” Lyara pointed, “for a Void Dragon  Halfling, you’re not so bad. I mean, aside from S.A.T. over here,  and from all the horror stories Sharyn told me while we took baths  together— ”</p>
<p>“AHA! I <em>knew</em> the plumbing wasn’t broken!”  Yenae screeched.</p>
<p>“There goes another one,” Herut muttered.</p>
<p>“Aaaaanyway,” she drawled, “you seem like a  fairly nice person— dragon— thing— whatever. I mean, I’m well  aware that you’re going to sacrifice us to some devil-god just so  you can get free television reception— which is a completely <em>asinine</em> way to exploit a loophole, if you ask me— but so  far, I’ve got nothing but compliments.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I already sacrificed you all,” Diana said  idly.</p>
<p>“The what now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s over, I’m finished. You all can go  home if you want, or stay behind and get rid of that pesky virginity.  I mean, whatever you want.”</p>
<p>“But…um…pardon me for my ineloquence, but…<em>how</em>?”</p>
<p>“Well, you all clearly <em>sacrificed</em> time out of  your busy schedule, time which you could use to get rid of your  virginity— ”</p>
<p>“Would you stop saying that?!” Alala shrieked.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a good use of time,” Yenae pouted.</p>
<p>“— so by using that sacrifice, I was able to get  free TV!”</p>
<p>“And another one,” Herut sighed. The silence this  time was much longer as everyone tried to grasp the sheer stupidity  of this plan. There were just no words to describe it.</p>
<p>“Is that what you did with all those nerds— I mean,  sci-fi aficionados?”</p>
<p>“Nope. I ate them.”</p>
<p>“You <em>ate</em> them?! That’s barbaric!”</p>
<p>“Not really. They were all wearing red shirts, so  it’s okay.”</p>
<p>“…Oh.”</p>
<p>“So…we can leave?” Mink said.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Or you could stay and watch TV with me,  Sexually Ambiguous Troll, and Princess HIRT. We have cookies and 400  channels!”</p>
<p>“Sold!” Shana squeaked.</p>
<p>“I have been hankering for some fresh-baked  macaroons, and I desperately need to get caught up in my stories, do  you know how long it’s been since I’ve watched TV, well, we have  them on the ship, but we don’t get good reception in space, not as  good as in my mansion, anyway, someone be a dear and remove these  shackles, I can’t seem to move my arms and I need them for eating  cookies!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that won’t be necessary!” Diana purred,  towering over the eight helpless women menacingly. “You see, I  won’t let you escape just yet!”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I knew it would come to this, yes, torture,  she’s as evil as they come, Lyara, you really are a poor judge of  character, just look at the sadistic gleam in— ”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” everyone screamed. Diana said, “I’m  not going to torture you, so just relax! I’m only going to seduce  you all and take your virginity.”</p>
<p>“WHAT!!” Alala shrieked. Diana shrugged.</p>
<p>“I’m a dragon, this is what I do.”</p>
<p>“Half-Void Dragon, actually, but I beg you, please  don’t rape us, I was saving myself for the client of my life, yes,  maybe even a husband or two, who knows, or else someone I was to have  a secret affair with— ”</p>
<p>“I’m not even going to <em>touch</em> you, so just  cool it! Troll, unchain her and force her out of my secret hidden  lair which has been hidden in secret from everybody for all  eternity.”</p>
<p>Suddenly…!</p>
<p>“NOT SO FAST, FOUL TEMPTRESS!!!”</p>
<p>“Damn it!” Diana screamed. “How’d they find my  extremely secret hidden lair?!”</p>
<p>“I <em>swear</em>, Benjamin, if this is ANOTHER wrong  evil hideout, there won’t be a healing spell in the world that will  save you!”</p>
<p>“Trust me, we’ve got to hit the right one  eventually! We’ve only found thirty-seven of them: how many more  can there be?”</p>
<p>Diana froze. “Oh. That answers that question.”</p>
<p>“Your impregnable fortress has been penetrated at  last, evil wench!” Lance proclaimed.</p>
<p>“Dude, it seriously creeps me out when you say things  like that,” Shawn shuddered.</p>
<p>“Prepare for a whacking! And a beating! The spear of  justice shall plunge into your inner being!”</p>
<p>“Lance, seriously! At least wait until I’ve turned  into a woman again! Ooh, a dragon’s hoard!”</p>
<p>COUNTLESS POOFS!</p>
<p>“Curse your heroic bones!” Diana screeched. “Troll,  after them! Show no mercy!”</p>
<p>“My bones shall never be cursed, foul one!” Lance  cried. Shawn (or was it Shaun?) covered his face with his hand.</p>
<p>“Well <em>hello</em> sailor!” Troll exclaimed.  “What’s a stud like you doing in a cave like this? Ooh, are we  going to play ‘dungeon master’? Sounds swell! Oh, light bulb goes  off! Why don’t we all do brunch instead and go skating after? I  know a <em>great</em> place, honeys!”</p>
<p>“Never have I faced such a malicious demon before!”  Lance yelled hopelessly. “This shall require ALL the thrusting I  have!”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah, knock yourself out, man,” Shawn  muttered. “I’ll just go, uh…‘liberate’ more treasure. Ooh,  sexy hostages!”</p>
<p>MANY MORE POOFS! And with that last poof, the eight  virgins were freed, even though one or two probably wanted to stay  for the free cookies and kinky half-Void Dragon sex. As Sir Lance the  Dragonslayer fought Sexually Ambiguous Troll, everyone else ganged up  on Diana. Suddenly, Hot Independent Rebellious Tomboy Princess  stepped in front of her, shielding her with her body.</p>
<p>“Noooooooooooooooooooooooooo! DON’T KILL HER!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, be nice,” Troll added.</p>
<p>“No, I mean…I’m in love with her!”</p>
<p>“Dun-dun-DUNNN!!” Rachel said.</p>
<p>“We’re really racking up the awkward pauses in this  chapter, folks,” Herut said.</p>
<p>“Fourth wall!” Aseria spat.</p>
<p>“What can I say?” Princess HIRT gushed, cuddling  next to Diana. “You get kidnapped by enough lesbian Void Dragon  halflings over time, and you grow…attached to them.”</p>
<p>“So THAT’S why dragons are always kidnapping  princesses!” Chandra exclaimed. Many an eye rolled that day.</p>
<p>“Waaaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiiiit!” Sir Lance cried out,  also stepping forth to shield Diana. “I too know of the seductive  wiles of the Void Dragons!”</p>
<p>“Oh god, here we go,” Athena groaned.</p>
<p>“You see, the title of ‘Dragonslayer’ is not <em>entirely</em> accurate.”</p>
<p>“He’s <em>not</em>,” she growled. Fuuka held her  hand firmly.</p>
<p>“He is, honey bunny. Just accept it.”</p>
<p>“I’m really more of a…Dragon LAYER.”</p>
<p>“And we never saw it coming!!” Athena screamed  sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Then this means…” Lyara whispered. Lance nodded  and looked right at Diana.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m…her father.”</p>
<p>“Dun-dun-DUNN!!” Rachel said again.</p>
<p>“Okay, that’s it! I’m going back to the ship!”  Herut stormed off in a rage, leaving everyone else frozen solid—  even Sexually Ambiguous Troll.</p>
<p>“But…that means…” Sharyn couldn’t finish the  sentence.</p>
<p>“That means you fucked your own half-sister,” Lil  said, ever tactful.</p>
<p>“And here I thought I was the only one,” Aseria  noted.</p>
<p>“Cool, cookies!” Shawn exclaimed.</p>
<p>POOF! And everything was all right from that moment on.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>And so, with that “educational” episode out of the  way, the heroes returned for a…uh, heroic welcome. Lance revealed  to everyone what a player he was, and even admitted to siring  children through Benjamin and Shawn’s female alter ego…among  many, many others. Sharyn would have been unbearably traumatized for  life, but her admiration for her father was absolute, and besides, it  wasn’t as if she were all that chaste either.</p>
<p>“So, you and the Captain of the women’s elite,  huh?” Kate pointed. Sharyn cringed.</p>
<p>“It was one time!”</p>
<p>“And that centaur, that fairy, and that maiden you  rescued from the burning tower.”</p>
<p>“Don’t forget Princess HIRT and Jamie the  milkmaid!”</p>
<p>“Sharyn, you stud, you!”</p>
<p>“SHUT UP!”</p>
<p>[No.]</p>
<p>“I’m still reeling over Amy’s little revelation,”  Chandra said.</p>
<p>“I suppose we all have our secrets,” Lyara said.  She wasn’t particularly angry at Sharyn’s indiscretions— in  fact, it was a little arousing. At least she knew her friend wasn’t  quite as innocent as she pretended— “Although I wonder how one  congregates with a centaur.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather not indulge anyone,” Sharyn groaned—  “but I will say it involves a stepstool.”</p>
<p>“Kinky,” Naja grinned, suddenly gaining a new  respect for her fellow emerald-skinned lady. “Speaking of kinky,  has anybody seen Amy? I’d like to treat her to an ale while we’re  here.” Everyone else wondered the same, but before a search and  rescue team could be assembled, Dr. Miracle quietly appeared, limping  out of the Thrustwell household, appearing immensely pleased with  herself. It didn’t take them long to draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>“You <em>didn’t</em>!!” Alala choked. Miracle  blushed.</p>
<p>“Let’s just say that I found out where he got that  name.”</p>
<p>“Oh, GOD! Woo-hoo, you go, girl! What a stud! Hey,  maybe you’ll get another sibling out of this, Shar! Way to go wild,  Miracle! Woo!” Aghast, Sharyn rushed to the beaming woman and  grabbed her arms desperately.</p>
<p>“Amy, tell me thou didst not— ”</p>
<p>“Relax, he just showed me his family tree.”</p>
<p>“That is not assuring!”</p>
<p>“His genealogy, Sharyn! I wouldn’t cause a married  man to have an affair! Besides, from what he showed me, the Lady  Thrustwells have just as strong a libido as the men!”</p>
<p>“Ain’t that the truth!” Allegra cackled, slapping  Sharyn on the back. The poor girl turned red all over and stayed that  way as she boarded the <em>Dauntless</em> and bade her homeworld  farewell.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>To show that there were no hard feelings between them—  that, even though she had discovered Sharyn was kind of a sex fiend,  Lyara would still love her and stand by her side— lady Tanith snuck  out of her room and wandered to Sharyn’s, hoping to offer her some  comfort after that trying (and disturbing) ordeal. She knocked twice  and was granted entrance: the room was lit with soft candles and the  gentle sound of harps could be heard playing. The door closed behind  her as a beautiful green warrior, secluded in the shadows, approached  her, garbed in a humble white bathrobe.</p>
<p>“Sharyn,” Lyara greeted, feeling a little shaky.  “How are you holding up?”</p>
<p>“Fairly well after some personal reflection. Father’s  rampaging hormones aside, my family is my family, and to them I owe  my honor and love.”</p>
<p>“Does your…mother know about all this?”</p>
<p>“Theirs is a marriage of convenience,” she  chuckled. “Frankly, my mother is just as…virile as he is. Through  their adultery, ironically, they draw closer to one another. Alas  that I was their only child! Yet I can take joy in my…extended  relations. Discovering my many brothers and sisters has warmed my  heart.”</p>
<p>“That’s good. A loving family consumed by their  sexual impulses is still a loving family, and for that, I envy you.”</p>
<p>“Thou art too sweet, dear one. So,” she purred,  changing the subject quickly, “thou art a maiden still, aye?  Perhaps something can be done about that.” She untied the slip  around her robe and let it fall to the floor, just as the candles  burned their brightest. Lyara gawked at the pure emerald before her.</p>
<p>“Sweet Legolas on a pogo stick!”</p>
<p>And they lived happily ever after.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not every crewmember could be so lucky…</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Ah, excuse me, can somebody direct me to the nearest  spaceport, I seem to have been left behind, I don’t understand how  my comrades could’ve left me here, I’m clearly the most talented  and capable, or at least the wealthiest, and that’s got to count  for something, oh, won’t someone please come and rescue me, I’m  tired of being the butt of every joke, I don’t deserve this!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Poor Vimmy.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>…Not really.</p>
<p>　</p>
