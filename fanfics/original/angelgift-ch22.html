<a href="../original/angelgift-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Allison Tennison stood in front of the bookstore she owned, her sandy 
brown hair falling down into her eyes. The sign they had just put up on 
the door read that they were closed temporarily and apologized to all 
their loyal customers. The casually dressed young woman rested her hand 
on the doorway then smiled wryly as she conceded, &quot;I&#39;ll miss this.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Jenna said softly, the black haired woman holding on to her 
other hand.

Allison looked over at Jenna and smiled warmly, &quot;But I&#39;d miss you more, 
so....&quot;

Jenna didn&#39;t answer aloud, instead she pressed her body to Allison&#39;s, 
holding her close. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she finally murmured, kissing her 
gently.

They separated after a few moments, Allison smiling at her happily. 
&quot;We&#39;d better get going,&quot; she said, the two of them moving away from the 
shop and down the street. &quot;So do we have to do this again?&quot; she asked as 
they ducked into an alley.

&quot;It&#39;s always easier the second time,&quot; Jenna said to her gently, the two 
moving to stand in the shadows. out of sight from the street.

Allison puffed out a breath, &quot;I hope you&#39;re right.&quot; She raised the 
wristband that she wore and said into it, &quot;Request slip-transit, Liberty 
Sword.&quot;

The two women were gradually surrounded by violet light, etched in the 
wave of energy, then they were simply gone... ... only to reappear in 
the transit room of the cruiser Liberty Sword.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Jenna asked as she looked over at Allison, 
worriedly checking for any signs of illness.

Allison swallowed a bit nervously then she smiled slightly. &quot;Looks like 
I&#39;m fine,&quot; she looked very relieved as they stepped off of the disk.

&quot;Welcome back,&quot; Kat smiled, her long brown braid flowing down her back. 
&quot;Milly is closing up your penthouse suite along with Sharin,&quot; she 
relayed, the uniform she wore crisp and neat. The black jacket and pants 
fit her well, the glossy boots tapping against the alloy floor as they 
walked off.

&quot;Milly and Sharin, huh?&quot; Allison smiled slightly as she mused, &quot;I wonder 
why Sharin felt she had to come along?&quot;

&quot;They don&#39;t seem to like being separated, do they?&quot; Kat agreed as they 
went into one of the lifts, the glowing disk carrying them up.

&quot;You&#39;re wearing insignia from the medical division,&quot; Jenna quietly noted 
as she looked at Kat&#39;s uniform thoughtfully.

&quot;I have some first aid training,&quot; Kat admitted, &quot;and I have one of the 
engineers showing me the sickbay crew.&quot; She smiled wryly as she added, 
&quot;There doesn&#39;t seem to be anyone else on board that&#39;s more qualified 
so....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Allison said quietly, a slight smile on her 
face.

&quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Kat said cheerfully. &quot;Marilyn and Roma are both down with 
the crew working on their cruiser, hopefully being helpful,&quot; she added.

&quot;Well, Roma&#39;s helping anyway,&quot; Jenna chuckled softly, fondly thinking of 
Marilyn&#39;s good natured helplessness.

&quot;Welcome aboard,&quot; Laurel got up from the captain&#39;s chair to offer a 
salute as they reached the bridge. The blue haired commander stood at 
attention, clearly expecting a response.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Allison prompted Jenna softly.

&quot;At ease,&quot; Jenna loudly repeated the phrase and Laurel relaxed slightly. 
&quot;Carry on,&quot; she said, &quot;Allison and I need to go get changed.&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t get too distracted,&quot; a voice called from the tactical 
station at the front of the bridge. Amara tossed them a impish smile 
before the dark haired woman turned back to the engineer who was running 
her through operating the panel.

&quot;Amara,&quot; Allison scolded as she and Jenna left the bridge

&quot;That was scary,&quot; Lieutenant Alex Keron murmured as the black haired 
young man bent over the station beside her, &quot;I thought you were in 
trouble.&quot;

Amara smirked, &quot;You&#39;ll get used to Allison and Jenna, trust me.&quot;

The corridor leading to the Captain&#39;s quarters was placed just off the 
bridge, intended to allow quick access in an emergency. The rooms 
themselves were quite spotless, Milly having only begun to move all of 
their stuff into the set of rooms. There was a comfortable sitting room, 
a small study, and the bedroom but that was all.

&quot;The uniform I requested for you is here,&quot; Jenna noted as she picked up 
the bundle of cloth from a table by the entrance.

Allison smiled wryly, &quot;Thanks.&quot; She took the clothes and matching boots 
then walked to the bedroom, Jenna right behind her. She blushed faintly 
as she stripped her clothes off, setting them aside then pulled the 
black pants on. Standing in her bra she grabbed the white undershirt 
then slid the black jacket over her shoulders, buttoning up swiftly.

Jenna&#39;s gaze was admiring as she looked Allison over. &quot;You look 
handsome,&quot; she sighed happily as she made a few adjustments to the gold 
trim.

Allison blushed again, brighter, but managed a smile in return. &quot;Are you 
going to dress up in one of these, too?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Jenna shook her head, &quot;there&#39;s a reason that I wanted you in 
uniform.&quot; She smiled a dangerous smile as she gave Allison a predatory 
look, &quot;Well, besides the obvious one.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re terrible,&quot; Allison said with a shake of her head. She frowned 
then asked, &quot;So what was the other reason?&quot;

&quot;I think I&#39;ll need some help explaining,&quot; Jenna sighed. She raised her 
voice, &quot;Computer, please call Commander Laurel to the Captain&#39;s 
quarters.&quot;

&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; the computer replied.

A few moments later there was a chime at the door and Jenna opened the 
door. Laurel strode inside, walking over to the two of them. &quot;Princess,&quot; 
she nodded to Jenna then looked over at Allison. After a moment she 
nodded, &quot;This could work.&quot;

Allison got that odd feeling that she had missed something important. 
&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked the two of them.

&quot;You haven&#39;t told her, ma&#39;am?&quot; Laurel asked, running a hand through her 
blue hair.

&quot;I haven&#39;t really had the chance,&quot; Jenna answered calmly, &quot;and I was 
hoping to have your help explaining, as well.&quot;

Before Allison could ask again Laurel waved her over to a couch, &quot;This 
is going to take a few minutes.&quot; Once Jenna and Allison had sat down she 
said, &quot;As you know this ship is primarily crewed by the engineering 
staff, rather than military crew.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Allison nodded, waiting for the other shoe to drop.

&quot;And that goes for me, too,&quot; Laurel continued, &quot;I was a ship&#39;s engineer 
before I came aboard, and I have no real military experience.&quot; She 
smiled ruefully, &quot;My first response is that of handling an engineering 
problem, not as a combat leader.&quot;

&quot;We need a captain,&quot; Jenna said, &quot;someone who can lead both our friends 
and this engineering crew into battle if necessary.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;m entirely willing to support you,&quot; Allison said to Jenna, 
squeezing her hand comfortingly, &quot;from what I&#39;ve seen you can handle 
it.&quot;

&quot;She isn&#39;t who we have in mind,&quot; Laurel smiled slightly as she studied 
Allison.

It took Allison a moment to get it then her eyes widened. &quot;Oh no,&quot; she 
shook her head firmly, &quot;I have no military experience at all. How could 
I even think to...?&quot;

&quot;I think you can,&quot; Jenna said, still holding on to Allison&#39;s hand.

&quot;More importantly I&#39;ve seen your friends,&quot; Laurel said gravely, &quot;you may 
not realize it but they take their cues from you as much as from the 
Princess.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea how your ship runs,&quot; Allison answered her softly, &quot;how 
could I be expected to command it?&quot;

&quot;A ship&#39;s captain relies on her crew to do their jobs,&quot; Jenna pointed 
out quietly, &quot;the captain provides them the direction and focus.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t put it quite that simply,&quot; Laurel said, &quot;but it&#39;s basically 
true.&quot; She smiled slightly, &quot;Of course I&#39;d be willing to stand as your 
second in command to help with any technical problems.&quot;

Allison sat there a moment, digesting their words and hearing the 
urgency behind them. &#39;This is serious,&#39; she realized as she wrestled 
with her thoughts. Finally she took a breath, meeting Jenna&#39;s eyes, &quot;If 
you really need me to do this, I will.&quot;

Jenna threw her arms around the startled Allison as she squealed, &quot;Thank 
you!&quot;

Laurel fought back a smile at that. &quot;Princess, I&#39;ll need you to do the 
honors,&quot; she held out two gleaming metal insignia to Jenna.

&quot;Upon the honor of my house,&quot; Jenna said formally as she clipped the 
symbols to each side of Allison&#39;s neck, &quot;I today give you a field 
promotion of captain.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Laurel threw a salute, standing there formally.

&quot;Commander,&quot; Allison returned the salute, meeting those eyes gravely, 
&quot;let&#39;s hope we don&#39;t end up regretting this.&quot;</pre>
