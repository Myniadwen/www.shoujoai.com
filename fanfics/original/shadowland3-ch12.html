<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 12 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The Western Dorms were designed in a large &quot;L&quot; shape with rooms lining 
the exterior of the building and showers and washrooms taking up the 
middle. The elbow of the building was left open with a large set of 
floor to ceiling windows stretching along the far wall and group of 
tables and chairs filling the middle, giving the girls a quiet space to 
study. Outside of the picture windows was a long balcony bordered by a 
fancy black iron railing that matched the outdoor chairs and table with 
their frosted glass tops. Upon one of these chairs stretched Kris, her 
legs up on a second chair, her eye closed as she gazed up at the fading 
sun and the breeze playing with her open shirt. The soft sound of 
someone playing the grand piano in the study area drifted out onto patio 
as she relaxed, trying hard to allow the days events to drift from her 
mind. She was nearly asleep when she heard commotion inside and turned 
to see Jenn run down the hall. Curiously Kris got to her feet and 
cautiously followed the girl back to her room to find the door open and 
Jenn frantically sifting through one of the wardrobes.

&quot;Jenn? Is everything alright?&quot; She inquired groggily, yawning slightly. 

Jenn let out a sign of frustration and ran a hand through her short 
straight black hair, letting it fall back in front of her left eye as 
she slammed a hand upon the wardrobe dresser draw, &quot;Kim had her period 
and didn&#39;t even realize it.&quot; Jenn said quickly as she pulled a dress 
from a hanger and some panties from one of the draws on the wardrobe 
that used to belong to the other Kim. 

Kris watched the girl from the doorway, &quot;She did?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Jenn replied, only half paying attention to the other girl in 
the room. 

&quot;She is a big girl.&quot; Kris remarked sleepily, &quot;She can handle herself.&quot; 

Jenn stood to her full height, glaring up at Kris, &quot;What would you know 
about any of this?&quot; She growled, &quot;Do Angels of Death even have a 
period?&quot; 

Kris flushed in embarrassment, &quot;Well... not exactly...&quot; 

Jenn rolled her eyes, &quot;Then how would you understand what she is going 
through?&quot; 

Kris step forward in defence, &quot;It is just a natural part of a girl&#39;s 
life. Why are you taking this so seriously?&quot; She demanded feeling 
angered by Jennifer&#39;s aggressive words. 

Jenn stared Kris directly in the eyes, &quot;Because, she has been lost in 
those dreams for so long she doesn&#39;t even remember having a period 
before. She is lost and scare and doesn&#39;t even understand what is going 
on with her own body.&quot; She explained in aggravation of Kris&#39;s ignorance, 
&quot;But how would you understand that? You jump through dreams like it is 
no big deal, while we have to deal with the after effects. Did you know 
she can&#39;t even remember who she was? She is so confused she can only 
recall the dreams she just escaped from.&quot; Jenn feel silent as she 
realized she had pretty much described her own experiences arriving in 
the Shadowlands for the first time. 

Kris staggered back as Jenn&#39;s words set in, &quot;She never...&quot; She blinked 
several time then glanced at Jenn, &quot;How is she? Where is she?&quot; Suddenly 
concerned for the girl.

&quot;I left her in the shower.&quot; Jenn stated in greater hast then before, 
grabbing a white plastic grocery bag from beside her bed, a bag that 
still held the tampons along with a large bag of Doritos that she had 
bought that very morning. &quot;Why should you care?&quot; She snapped at the 
girl, growing increasingly more agitated with herself for not staying at 
the girl&#39;s side as she recalled how lost she felt on her first arrival 
at the school, &quot;All you care about is yourself anyway.&quot; She added the 
clothes to the bag and started out of the room.

Kris was even more startled by this assault, &quot;What? Where did that come 
from?&quot; She inquired in confusion, &quot;I care about all of you. You are like 
family to me.&quot;

&quot;Is this how you treat your family?&quot; Jenn shook her head. &quot;Wait, you 
beat your sister into the ground so of course that is how you treat 
them. Forget it. Forget everything. I have to go.&quot; She quickly pushed 
passed the girl and fled down the hall in such a rush that she nearly 
crashed into a small girl who was running towards her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She 
quickly apologized as she danced around the girl.

&quot;No problem.&quot; The girl replied and then turned back to Jenn before she 
could run off, &quot;Do you know where Kris Tallet is?&quot; She inquired glancing 
up and down the hall.

Jenn pointed to her room, &quot;You will find her in my room.&quot; She stated 
coldly, &quot;But I don&#39;t know why you would want to see her.&quot; 

&quot;Well, Jessica is not here and I hear she was the new head of the dorm 
so...&quot; The girl started to explain. 

&quot;Well, good luck with her.&quot; Jennifer stated as she started back down the 
hall, backwards, &quot;She is a handful.&quot; 

The girl blinked in confusion as she watched Jenn round a corner and 
disappear. Shaking her head in dismay she turned to the open door and 
knocked lightly, &quot;Ummm... Miss. Tallet?&quot; She inquired softly. 

Kris was sitting upon Jennifer&#39;s bed with her head in her hand, &quot;Who is 
it?&quot; She inquired miserably. 

&quot;My name is Cathy and I heard you were the new Western Dorm Head.&quot; She 
said nervously as she stood in the door to the room. 

Kris raised her head to look upon the girl, she appeared to be no more 
then twelve years old with shoulder length mousy grey hair and wore a 
white t-shirt, that appeared to swallow the girl, and jeans to sizes to 
big. Kris rubbed at her forehead and stood, &quot;I&#39;m kind of busy right now, 
so this better be quick.&quot; She remarked in distain. 

&quot;Well...&quot; The girl hopped from one foot to another as she tried to form 
her words, &quot;Jessica is not around so I thought you should know that 
there is a problem in the cafeteria.&quot; 

Kris ran a hand through her messy curls and yawned, &quot;What kind of 
problem?&quot; She inquired uncaringly. 

&quot;A fight.&quot;
