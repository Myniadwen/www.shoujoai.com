<h1>Between the Lines (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ilze.html">Ilze</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/betweenlines-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;What time is it?&quot; I ask myself and roll over in bed to see the clock, 
8:00. Half an hour til Lucas&#39; party should begin. The sit up with a 
yawn. Hours ago, I was caught eavesdropping on a conversation between my 
father and grandfather and learned that my long lost brother Joel was 
back. I promised not to find him yet though but that didnt stop Dad from 
grounding me for eavesdropping. Thankfully though, he will still allow 
me to go to the party.

I get out of bed and walk over to my closet. The door opens with a sqeak 
and I look over my mess of clothes. Carefully, I decide on the outfit 
for the night, pink blouse with a black short skirt. Taking the outfit, 
I leave my bedroom and enter the upstairs bathroom which was more mine 
than anyone elses. I brush my teeth to rid it of the horrible taste of 
my grandpa&#39;s pizza then change out of my pj&#39;s. It takes another moment 
to get into my new outfit then I turn to the counter in front of me, 
riddled with personal care items. I smile as I look over all the 
cosmetics and such, all my friends have always said I&#39;m a girly girl. 
The type who likes &#39;cute&#39; things and is obsessed with fashion which is 
kinda true. I love looking good and I really like having up-to-date 
clothing. I suppose I am a feminine girl.

It takes a good 10+ minutes for me to put on my personal care items then 
I have to fix my chestnut hair. I settle with it laying close to my 
shoulders but I still frown at the look. I&#39;ve never liked my hair much, 
unlike Kelli&#39;s. Her hair was perfect and the colored streaks running 
through it only makes it better. With a sigh, I leave the bathroom and 
go back into my bedroom where I slip on some socks and kick my tennis 
shoes on. Turning back toward my nightstand, I check the clock: 8:24.

Before I turn to head downstairs, I notice that there is a message on my 
phone. I decide to check the message before a leave and press the &#39;play&#39; 
button on the phone. The automated voice says that the message was taped 
an hour ago, while I was in the shower. The voice continues and gets to 
the message. Kelli&#39;s voice comes over the speakers.

&#39;Hey, Lexi. I suppose you&#39;re making yourself all cute, huh? Dont bother, 
you look cute as you are.&#39; I giggle at the comment, &#39;Anyways, mind 
giving me a ride? Joey and Clark apparently have dates and they dont 
want me hitting on their girls.&#39; A sigh comes through the speakers, 
&quot;Well, call me back, will ya?&#39;

The message ends with the automated voice saying the date again and I 
pick up the phone and dial Kelli&#39;s cell phone number. The phone rings 
twice before someone answers, it&#39;s Kelli. &quot;Hey, Kel.&quot;

&quot;Alexia? Where&#39;ve ya been?&quot;

&quot;Making myself cute, what else.&quot; We share a laugh, &quot;So, you need a 
ride?&quot;

&quot;No. I supposed you werent gonna call so Burg is giving me a ride.&quot;

&quot;Alrighty then. I&#39;ll see you there?&quot;

&quot;Yep. Burg&#39;s right here so we&#39;re gonna be leaving in a couple minutes.&quot;

&quot;Okay. See you there.&quot;

&quot;Bye.&quot;

I hang up the phone and prepare to leave. I double-check myself in the 
mirror before I head downstairs and go and find gramps in the living 
room watching what looked like &#39;I Love Lucy.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m gonna go now, Grandpa.&quot; I walk over to him and bend over to embrace 
him.

He returns the hug, &quot;Alright. Have a good time and remember curfew. Home 
by Eleven.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. Bye.&quot;

&quot;See-ya later.&quot;

Leaving Grandpa, I walk to the front door and step outsdie into the 
setting Sun. My car is sitting in the usual spot and I stroll over to it 
but notice a piece of paper in the door. I take the paper suspicously 
and open the folded note, it&#39;s a letter adressed to me. It reads:

Alexia,

Hey. How&#39;ve ya been? You looked beautiful when I saw you yesterday. Just 
wanted to let you know I&#39;m back. We&#39;ll talk later.

Joel

I gulp and fold the paper and take a seat in my car. When had I seen 
Joel? I shrug the thought and decide to save it for later. Before I 
start the car, I put the letter in my glove compartment. The Honda 
starts without trouble and I pull out into the street and head towards 
the Lucas home where the party will be waiting.

as I suspected, the party had already started. I park my car across the 
street from the Lucas property and step out of my car, being sure to 
lock it as well. I journey across the street and make my way up towards 
the house. The Lucas property is a rather large home. It is three 
stories with a large front yard and a swimming pool in the back. The 
front gate that led up the driveway was open so I walk into the 
frontyard. Thankfully, the heavy drinking had yet to start. Looking 
about the grassy area, I spot a bunch of people I know. Finally, I find 
Clark and make my way over to my bronze-skinned friend.

Of course, Clark has to look magnificent. He is wearing a sleeveless 
metalliic-colored shirt and baggy blue jeans with a chain hanging from a 
pocket. He smiles at me as I come over and I notice his right ear has a 
stud in it.

&quot;Hey.&quot; He greets me, &quot;You&#39;re lookin&#39; good.&quot;

&quot;Right back at ya.&quot; I laugh and pat him on the shoulder, &quot;Where&#39;s you&#39;re 
date.&quot;

&quot;Inside.&quot; He points a finger towards the home, &quot;It&#39;s getting crazy in 
there already.&quot;

&quot;Is everyone else inside?&quot;

&quot;Kelli and Burg are but I think Joey went out back.&quot;

I hide a smile when I hear what Joe&#39;s doing. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go in. You 
coming?&quot;

He shrugs, &quot;Why not?&quot;

The two of us enter the Lucas home and we&#39;re greeted by the blare of 
loud music and the talking of guest, &quot;Half the school here, huh?&quot; 
Apparently, Clark doesnt here me as he proceeds into the house. I follow 
him as he walks over to some girl. I barely recognize his date. She is a 
Freshman who I didnt really know. Anna, or something like that. &quot;I&#39;m 
gonna go find Kel!&quot; I shout and he nods his bald head. Seaching the 
crowd, I eventually spot Kelli, sitting with a heavily cloaked Burg 
against the wall. I walk over to them and sit down.

&quot;Hey.&quot; They greet me and I return the greeting.

&quot;Having fun?&quot; I ask them.

Kelli shrugs halfhearedly and I notice a bruise on her right arm. Burg 
frowns, &quot;A bunch of idiotic teenagers dancing to music they dont even 
listen to while mass consuming alcoholic beverages? What could be 
funner?&quot;

I giggle at his comment, still wondering why he was here. Kelli stands, 
&quot;Well, I&#39;m a teenage idiot who isnt listening to this music. Why not 
include the beer? You guys want any?&quot;

Burg shakes his head. I&#39;m not a heavy drinker either so I turn her down. 
Kelli shrugs and walks off.

Burg and I sit by ourselves for a good ten minutes until he seems to 
notice something and stands. &quot;I&#39;m gonna go mingle.&quot;

I raise an eyebrow as my black-clad friend as he walks into the massive 
crowd. Looking around, I also notice that Kelli seems to have bailed on 
me. Sighing, I stand and decide to attempt and have fun. I walk into the 
crowd of happy, or drunk, teenagers. I turn down several guys who ask me 
to dance, drink, or do... less moral things then I notice Tora Lucas.

The guy is dancing toward me with two cups in his hands. I sigh and he 
smiles at me, &quot;Hey, Lexy. Drink up.&quot;

I hold up my hands, &quot;Um, no thanks, Tor.&quot;

&quot;Cmon, babe. Have some fun.&quot;

&quot;No, thanks. Maybe later.&quot;

He sighs, &quot;Fine. I&#39;ll hold ya to it.&quot;

&quot;I bet.&quot; I escape him with a shive. Tora is a creep. All he ever wants 
is to get into a girl&#39;s pants by getting them drunk. I remember his last 
party, he&#39;d tried to get Kelli and me drunk. Luckily, we turned him down 
but he succeded in getting a sophmore into his room. I dunno how far 
they got though.

I walk outside, into the backyard where there were less people. Most 
people are either engaged in a conversation or making out. Turning 
around, I see Burg. He&#39;s standing under a leafless tree with another 
person. I move a little closer so I can see his companion&#39;s face and 
hear the conversation. Burg&#39;s companion is a girl. A cute little blonde 
who looks nothing like Burg&#39;s other friends.

I listen, &quot;When?&quot; The girl asks.

&quot;Two or three days. We aint sure yet but you can make it, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Marcus is alright with it?&quot;

&quot;Yes. We&#39;ve talked about it.&quot;

&quot;Good. I hope this works out.&quot;

&quot;It will, Trin. It will.&quot;

&#39;What are they talking about?&#39; I ask myself, &#39;This is really wierd and 
who is Trin?&#39;

I decide I&#39;ve eavesdropped enough for one day and force myself to leave 
Burg and &#39;Trin&#39; alone. Walking back toward the house, I notice Joey and 
a female sitting against the wall, locked in a kiss. I giggle lightly as 
I walk past them and into the house where the party seems to be getting 
much rowdier. The drinking apparently was picking up. I only notice 
Tamara at first, flirting with several men then I see Laura sitting with 
Kelli, who appeared to be under the influence. I start over to them but 
I&#39;m intercepted by Tora again.

&quot;Time for the drink.&quot;

&quot;No, Tora. I said no already.&quot;

&quot;You said later and it&#39;s later. Just one drink.&quot;

I look at the plastic cup in his hand, &quot;Will it shut you up?&quot;

He smiles, &quot;You wont even remember I&#39;m here.&quot;

&quot;Fine...&quot; I take the cup and take a long drink. The swallow suprises me 
as it tastes much less bitter than I remember.

&quot;Good, huh?&quot;

&quot;Whatever.&quot; I walk over and sit down after I take another drink. Tora 
follows, &quot;Why&#39;re you following me?&quot;

&quot;I want you to finish that.&quot;

I frown and chug the drink and shove the cup at him, &quot;Happy?&quot;

&quot;Very.&quot; He smiles as I lean back.

&quot;I&#39;m getting kind of dizzy.&quot;

&quot;Are you? Come here, I can help.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I shake my head as I realize what Tora Lucas had done, &quot;What was 
in the drink?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot; He says, &quot;It was just a normal glass of beer. Guinness, I 
beleive. Anyways, come on.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I stand on wobbly legs, &quot;I&#39;m gonna go home.&quot;

He follows, &quot;Come on. You cant even walk.&quot;

I stumble to the door and continue outisde. I feel the cool air against 
the skin. I think Tora is still following but I&#39;m not sure. Somehow, I 
manage to get to my car and get the key into the lock. The door opens 
with a squeak and I sit. The car starts and I pull down the street.

My headlights illuminate the street in front of me as I rub my eyes. 
&quot;Tora...&quot; I say, unsure if I had even spoke. The wheel seems to turn by 
itself as the car swirves across the street. I couldnt think, I think. 
Then, everything goes black. The last thing I feel is a thump on my 
forehead as I apparently fall unconcious and hit the wheel hard...

&quot;Alexia?&quot; A voice.

&quot;What?&quot; I answer mentally.

&quot;Can you wake up?&quot; It&#39;s a female.

&quot;No.&quot; Mental thoughts again.

&quot;Cmon. Open you&#39;re eyes.&quot; She has a soft voice. Sounds concerned.

&quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;

My eyes open but immediatly close as the artifical light of a lamp hits 
them, causing a sharp pain to enter my head. I didnt even catch and 
glance of my surroundings or who my speaker was.

&quot;Owch...&quot; I complain.

&quot;Careful.&quot; The female says, &quot;Can you open your eyes?&quot;

The light dims and I carefully open my eye lids. The pain in my head 
isnt quite as severe but I still feel a throbbing. I manage to look 
about at my surroundings but everything is blurry until I focus on one 
thing. When my vision clears, I see the speaker. It&#39;s a woman, as I 
said, an oriental woman.

&quot;Karen?&quot; I ask, my voice cracking slightly.

She smiles down at me, &quot;Yes. Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Wha...what happened? Where am I?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re at my apartment.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d I get here?&quot; I look around the bare, little room. I was 
apparently laid across a couch in what seemed like the living room of 
the apartment.

&quot;I found you.&quot; Karen stood from the squating position she had been in 
and looked down at me, &quot;You must have crashed. You&#39;re car was smashed 
against a tree and I wanted to check if anyone was there. Then I found 
you, sleeping in the driver&#39;s seat. I tried waking you up but you 
wouldnt do anything. What were you doing?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; My mind was blank. I search through my memories but the last 
thing I remember is arriving at Tora Lucas&#39; party... Everything after 
that was a blank. &quot;All I remember is going to a party.&quot;

&quot;Thats it?&quot; I nod slowly and she seems concerned, &quot;Alexia, were you 
drinking?&quot;

I think, nothing. &quot;I dont know.&quot; I say hesitantly.

Karen frowns at me, but not a dissapproving frown but a sympathetic 
frown. &quot;Alexia...&quot; She sat down, &quot;I think... um...&quot;

&quot;That I was drunk?&quot; I interrupt, &quot;Yeah, thats probably it. I&#39;ve only 
gotten drunk once but I have little tolerance.&quot;

&quot;Maybe.&quot; Is all she says.

&quot;Karen? What do you think happened?&quot; I ask hesitantly.

&quot;I think... you might have been... drugged.&quot;

I stare at the woman, not comprehending. I had heard people talk about 
the &#39;date-rape drug&#39; but... could it really happen to me? I dont 
remember ever even taking a drink... the last thing I remember was... 
spying on Burg... No... It couldnt have happened... No, if that happened 
to me then....

Karen looks at me, &quot;This happened to my sister and she... you seem just 
like her. She couldnt remember what had happened.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; I shake my head and sit up, something I regret as a sharp pain 
hits my head. My hand holds the pained spot and I feel hands on me, 
guiding me and laying me back down. I wince and look at Karen, &quot;I have a 
headache.&quot;

&quot;Rest here until you feel better.&quot; She smiles.

Just then, I notice how tired I am. My eyelids droop and I relax on the 
couch, &quot;What time is it?&quot; She answer, 10:20. Two hours or so since I 
arrived at the party, &quot;I&#39;d better be home by Ele... How&#39;s my car?&quot;

Karen stands and scratched her head, &quot;Well... I called a friend of mine 
and he&#39;s gonna repair it for ya. It was pretty messed up.&quot;

I sigh, &quot;Dad&#39;s gonna kill me...&quot;

I hear the oriental girl chuckle then she walks off. My eyelids close, 
only for a second, and I&#39;m back into my deep, dreamless sleep.

Upon waking up, I feel a cool breeze against my face. I look around and 
notice that I was outside, and I was moving off the ground. Nearly upon 
panick, I finally look up and see Karen. She had me cradled in her arms, 
carring me outside with suprising ease. Karen looks down at me and a 
pleasant smile plays across her tan features.

&quot;You said you wanted to be home by Eleven, right?&quot;

Nodding, &quot;Curfew.&quot; I yawn and watch as we come upon a car which 
obviously belonged to Karen. She set me down and my legs felt I jello. I 
fall but thankfully, Karen was there. She reached out and catched me in 
her arms, my face inches from hers.

She chuckles, &quot;You alright?&quot;

I smile back to her, &quot;Yeah. Just a little weak.&quot;

We remain like that for what seemed like hours until she finally helpes 
me over to the passenger side of the automobile and opened the door. I&#39;m 
able to ease myself into the seat by myself and my asian friend takes 
the seat beside me. The car starts with a low hum and it gently backs 
up.

&quot;How&#39;s that headache?&quot;

&quot;Better. It still kinda hurts though.&quot; I absently rub the throbbing 
area. &quot;Um... Karen?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You said your sister got... drugged. What happened to her?&quot;

Karen seemed to be troubled, as if feeling guilty for having to tell me 
this. Finally, she hesitantly spoke, &quot;My older sister, Koren, went to a 
party. She was about your age, give or take a year.&quot; She shrugged, 
&quot;Whatever. She met a guy there and he must have given her a drink or 
something because...&quot; She gulped, &quot;My sister came home sometime later 
and said she couldnt remember a thing that happened after she met that 
guy... she went to the doctor because she was feeling sick and he said 
she was pregnant. Of course, she said that was impossible. Then, she 
told the doc about the party and he said... that something must have 
been slipped into her drink. Koren had her kid about two months ago, a 
little boy.&quot;

The whole time, I think about a sex class I&#39;d been forced to take awhile 
ago. I&#39;d learned about the date-rape drug and now that I think about... 
I have the same symptoms... &quot;Do you think that&#39;s what happened to me?&quot;

&quot;I dont know Alexia...&quot; She keeps looking foreward, at the seemingly 
endless street, &quot;but I think you should go to the doctor to get checked 
out... just in case.&quot;

I think about that for a few moments and keep silent for most of the 
trip. I recognize the street we&#39;re on, it&#39;s the next street from my 
street, &quot;I dont think I will. If I start to feel any signs... I&#39;ll 
go...&quot;

Karen says nothing until we pull up to my house. She pulls into the 
drive way and I open the door, &quot;Thanks.&quot; I say and she nods. Right 
before I step out, I feel her grab my hand.

&quot;Alexia, wait.&quot;

I look back at Karen, her piercing, slanted eyes appear completely 
serious, staring into mine. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Alexia... my sister also... proved positive for AIDS. Her son inherited 
the disease.&quot;

I sit back down, my door closing. I gulp, &quot;That couldnt...&quot;

&quot;It can happen to anyone. Get tested.&quot; Feeling tears preparing to fall, 
I reach for the door but Karen stops me again, &quot;If you want, I&#39;ll pick 
you up tomorrow.&quot;

I nod, &quot;Yes, yes. Thanks.&quot; I stumble out of the car and wave to her 
absently as I stroll over to my door and fumble with the door until it 
finally opens. I walk in and jog up to my room right before my emotions 
overcome me. Laying down on my bed, I try to hold in the tears.
