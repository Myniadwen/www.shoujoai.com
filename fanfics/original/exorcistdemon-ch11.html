<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>      Krystal sighed as the hot water ran over her body. She had finally convinced Isaka to 
let her change and take a shower. Who knew the demon had such a nice bathroom? She stepped 
out of the shower and began to dry herself with a nearby towel.

      Isaka was... trying to court her. Such a strange thought! Krystal never thought that 
something like this would ever happen to her, seeing as they were both women and she had 
Seth. She frowned as she looked at the clothes or lack there of.

      There was a bra and panties (a little too frilly for Krystal&#39;s taste), but the only 
other article of clothing was a white bath robe. Krystal sighed as she dressed and pursed 
her lips in frustration as she put on the robe. It barely went halfway down her thighs and 
the top opened enough to show a tease of cleavage. Of course Isaka would give her something 
like that.

      She bashfully stepped out of the bathroom, anticipating the alluring stare of the 
demon- And was surprised to have no such feeling. She walked towards the bed and saw the 
still form of Isaka. Her chest rose and fell softly... and her eyes were closed.

      Krystal sat down on the bed and smoothed some of the hair out of Isaka&#39;s eyes. The 
demon must have fallen asleep... She turned out the lamp and pushed the woman under the 
covers. Krystal tried not to laugh as Isaka curled up.

      It was strange how sweet and vulnerable she seemed while she was asleep... Krystal was 
about to pull away, until she became aware of her arm trapped in Isaka&#39;s embrace. Instead of 
trying to escape and risk waking up Isaka, Krystal turned out the lamp and climbed in.

      The demon reminded her exactly of her five year old form as she snuggled into Krystal 
lovingly. Even in her sleep Isaka was still amorous... Krystal just embraced her and stroked 
her light brown hair. When Isaka woke up, Krystal would probably be in a bad situation, but 
right now, Isaka seemed so peaceful.

      Thus, the exorcist fell asleep embracing the demon. 

***** 

      &quot;You suck.&quot;

      Actually, Mina was quite good at poker which was the problem. Eveon awkwardly bounced 
her knee against the floor as she sat cross-legged. Trying to come up with a strategy to 
beat her girlfriend wasn&#39;t exactly easy seeing as it all depended on luck.

      Eveon hadn&#39;t even won a round yet, thus she was only in her bra and panties now. Mina 
just grinned happily as she shuffled the cards. &quot;

      &quot;Oh, Eveon... it&#39;s just a game!&quot; The blond girl ground her teeth before blushing. 
&quot;Yeah, well, it&#39;s not so fun!&quot; ...especially since she kept losing.

      Mina pouted, but threw Eveon&#39;s clothes at her. &quot;Fine. How about all or nothing? If I 
win, you have to take everything off.&quot; Eveon opened her mouth to protest, but Mina kept 
talking. &quot;...and if you win, you can put on all your clothes, we&#39;ll never play something 
like this without your permission and...&quot;

      She just winked at her girlfriend. &quot;...I&#39;ll take everything off.&quot;

      Eveon gulped, but nodded. This was her last chance. She looked at the cards Mina dealt 
out and prayed. She traded in three of her cards and whispered hopefully to herself. Then 
the time came. Mina set down her cards and revealed a full house. Eveon set down her own 
cards and blinked in surprise.

      &quot;Holy crap! I got a straight!&quot; Eveon stood up in glee and started putting on her 
clothes. Mina pouted at the results before standing up as well.

      Eveon was suddenly aware of what she had won when Mina began to pull the tank top over 
her head. The blonde stared at the creamy skin and strawberry decorated bra until her 
modesty suddenly reared its head.

      &quot;No, no, no, no, no! You don&#39;t have to take it off!&quot; Eveon promptly grabbed her 
girlfriend around the midsection in attempt to keep her top on. Eveon&#39;s cheek was flush up 
against Mina&#39;s body, just under her bra. Eveon was satisfied at seeing enough skin. She 
really didn&#39;t want to get bright red from Mina taking off too much.

      The other girl was laughing, trying to pull her top back down. &quot;But you won!&quot; Eveon 
just pulled Mina&#39;s shirt all the way down and just hugged her. &quot;How about we save your 
stripping for a different night... like in two years or so?&quot;

      Mina laughed and started smoothing out Eveon&#39;s hair. She hadn&#39;t tied it up in a 
ponytail yet... Eveon contently let her head rest on Mina&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Alright... when we&#39;re 
older... on a moonlit night... your going to get one heck of a surprise!&quot; 
 Eveon pouted at her girlfriend and gave her a smack on the arm. &quot;I dislike surprises 
Mina...&quot; Her pouting was promptly stopped by a kiss from her girlfriend. Just then, Eveon 
gently pushed her down and was above her.

      &quot;Mina... am I really the submissive ninny in this relationship?&quot; The other girl just 
stared up at her. &quot;Does it matter? You can be as dominant as you want... or submissive. 
Isn&#39;t that the point? I mean, we&#39;re equals, so it doesn&#39;t matter.&quot;

      Eveon just smiled and leaned down to kiss those inviting lips and-

      &quot;Sorry to interrupt your touching lesbian moment, but shouldn&#39;t we be looking for our 
awkward love triangle in action whom disappeared earlier today?&quot; Both girls jolted as Abby&#39;s 
voice interrupted their kiss.

      They looked up guiltily at the blond mother. &quot;Oh... and the Lamets want to see Mina 
and I&#39;m sure they&#39;d appreciate it if you two didn&#39;t lock lips when you go downstairs to see 
them.&quot;

      &quot;They&#39;re downstairs!?&quot; Both girls shouted in unison and went at work straightening 
their clothes, as Abby watched in slight humor. They were also trying to rearrange the room, 
thus bumping into many objects and the like. 

***** 

      Krystal awoke to feel warm breathing on her chest. She almost jumped away from the 
demon snuggled deeply in her arms, but luckily remembered where she was and why. Isaka had 
set up that devious trap and now, was fast asleep in her arms. Using her chest as a pillow, 
but regardless...

      The brunette demon was contently resting her head against Krystal&#39;s breast (the bath 
robe had somehow come open during their nap) and the exorcist couldn&#39;t bring herself to wake 
her. Instead, she gently caressed the demon&#39;s long hair, wondering how such a person could 
be so mischievous and so vulnerable.

      However, she was unaware that she was being watched. Seth peeked through the open door 
before letting out a sigh of total despair. He had convinced Tycara to let him out of the 
room, but... it seemed like he was too late. His girlfriend was already in the grips of the 
demon and with his luck, they had probably already... He shook his head to rid his mind of 
dirty thoughts as he watched her holding Isaka.

      &quot;...this sucks...&quot; He groaned out, backing away from the door and looking at Tycara. 
&quot;Really? Wow, I didn&#39;t know Isaka would move that fast...&quot; The silver haired girl soon bit 
her lip when she saw how upset he was.

      &quot;I really care about Krystal, so... I mean, I shouldn&#39;t hold her back out of 
selfishness, right?&quot; Tycara just watched as he paced back and forth. &quot;...I don&#39;t want to be 
a nuisance because I love her...&quot;

      Just then, Seth made his choice of what he was going to do.

      Of course, that was the moment that Krystal chose to come out of the room after 
disentangling herself from the demon. She jumped at the sudden sight of Seth and Tycara. 
&quot;Oh, Seth! You&#39;re alright!&quot; She instantly hugged her boyfriend who gave her an awkward pat 
on the back in response. Well, he really didn&#39;t want to know why she was barely wearing 
anything... and he really didn&#39;t want to think of what she had been doing earlier.

      &quot;Um, is Isaka still sleeping?&quot; Tycara asked, looking quite jealous of the couple. 
Krystal nodded. &quot;Yes, I left her a little note because I think me and Seth should get 
going... Do you know where my stuff is?&quot; Tycara nodded and led them over to another room.

      Seth was hoping he was making the right choice... he felt Krystal squeeze his hand and 
he just gulped. 

***** 

      &quot;...what?&quot; Krystal just stared at Seth, shock written all over her face. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
but I think it&#39;s better if we just...be friends.&quot;

      He shifted his weight to one foot, desperately trying to avoid looking into her eyes. 
&quot;You&#39;re breaking up with me?&quot; He bit his lip. &quot;Yeah...&quot;

      She swallowed hard and brought her hands up to her watering eyes. They had driven back 
to her apartment after escaping the mansion and saying bye to Abby... and now... he was at 
her front door telling her he did want to be with her?

      &quot;...do you not like me anymore? D-did I do something wrong?&quot; She started to sob and he 
shook his head. &quot;No! It&#39;s not you... it&#39;s not you. It&#39;s better this way alright. I&#39;d just 
hold you back and be a hindrance.&quot;

      When he tried to back away, Krystal just grabbed his arm. &quot;Seth! How can you say that? 
I... I think I love you, so please!&quot; He said nothing and pulled his arm away. She watched as 
he left the building to go to his car.

      Seth faintly heard her sob and close the door as he got in his car. He let his 
forehead fall against the steering wheel. He was sure he was doing the right thing! Krystal 
was... had... well, she was involved with Isaka and the last thing she needed was a 
boyfriend to screw things up.

      &quot;I did the right thing...&quot; He whispered to himself as he drove home. He knew Isaka ha 
already seduced Krystal, so it was better for him to step out of the way. &quot;...I wish I was a 
girl...&quot; He sighed out in despair before looking at his cell phone. Tycara had given him her 
phone number, so...
