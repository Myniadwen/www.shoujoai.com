<h1>Project Angelus (part 24 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>      &#39;I wonder if it&#39;s destiny or bad luck that I have to go fight this monster... I&#39;m the 
only one who can do it because it likes to chase me around and will only confront me. I 
want to have that dinner with Mariah and laugh with her in the room afterwards. I don&#39;t 
want to die here - there&#39;s a lot of things I still want to do... Regardless, I will 
hopefully write what happens in a few hours and talk about that wonderful dinner!&#39;

      Eveon swallowed awkwardly as she set the diary down. The rest of the pages afterwards 
were blank... Alice had died without getting to do what she wanted. Why was life so 
fragile? Miki&#39;s sister wished for the best and all that happened was her death.

      It didn&#39;t help the blonde&#39;s mood that Mina never returned her call. Had something 
happened and no one opted to tell her...? Or...? Suddenly, she realized what it meant that 
she finished the diary. Miki promised to explain what happened so...

      Eveon didn&#39;t have a chance to talk expressively to the girl until they were walking 
through a heavily wooded area. Why Hoshi decided to go this way and not on a normal 
sidewalk was beyond her...

      &quot;I finished Alice&#39;s diary.&quot;

      Miki almost gave herself whiplash looking over at Eveon. &quot;Already?!&quot;

      &quot;I can ask you about it now, can&#39;t I?&quot; Miki fidgeted uncomfortably at the sound of 
Eveon&#39;s question.

      &quot;Uh... not right now. I&#39;d rather explain it all when we&#39;re in a hotel room - this 
isn&#39;t a good setting for a long story,&quot; Miki said, looking ahead at the three sisters.

      &quot;Fine...&quot; Eveon huffed out, her heart still heavy. Mina was still on her mind... She 
paused when she felt the dark energy settle around them. &quot;I think the fiends are going to 
attack pretty soon.&quot;

      Hoshi turned around. &quot;I&#39;m not surprised. Miki, take Eveon and run.&quot;

      The order was quick and to the point - the last thing the silver haired woman needed 
was for Eveon to figure out what happened to Mina.

      &quot;Right!&quot; Miki said, grabbing Eveon&#39;s hand. &quot;We&#39;ll go this way and try to get to a 
populated area.&quot;

      She began to tug the blonde along as the three sisters got ready. &quot;Are you sure this 
is alright? We aren&#39;t equipped to take down a fiend,&quot; Tsuki murmured.

      &quot;We&#39;re going to stall,&quot; Hoshi said, motioning over to Hina. &quot;Try to concentrate on 
making fewer threads so you can increase their strength.&quot;

      It didn&#39;t take long for Solomon to appear. &quot;I see that Eveon has already taken off.&quot;

      Hoshi frowned as she drew her blade. &quot;Let me guess... you&#39;re here to distract us so 
someone else can get Eveon.&quot;

      His lips quirked up in a smile. &quot;Perhaps. I don&#39;t see why you should waste your time 
fighting me when you know you&#39;ll lose. Why don&#39;t we just wait until Eveon&#39;s been located 
and I&#39;ll run along?&quot;

      Hoshi looked back at her sisters, who were prepared. If they could just immobilize 
Solomon, then they could go back to Eveon...

      Miki looked over her shoulder as she felt a bit of energy come from where they just 
left. &quot;They must be fighting the fiend from before,&quot; the green eyed girl noted.

      &quot;Lovely,&quot; Eveon groaned. As they made it to a clearing, Miki let out a yelp as she 
almost incinerated by a blast of red energy.

      &quot;Eveon Kasaguri!&quot; When she heard her name, the blonde looked up to see Lilith. 
&quot;You&#39;re coming with me.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m fine, thanks,&quot; she replied as Miki got up and dusted the dirt off of her.

      &quot;Lilith...&quot; she whispered to herself. &quot;Eveon, run!&quot;

      She shoved the other girl who took off as Miki drew her sword. &quot;Didn&#39;t I kill you?&quot; 
Lilith asked nonchalantly as Miki turned around.

      Her lavender eyes widened ever so slightly as she drank in the girl&#39;s looks. &quot;I did 
kill you...&quot; Lilith murmured. &quot;Tell me, why are you pretending to be a very dead and very 
stupid Miki Uramoto?&quot;

      Miki clamped her mouth shut, trying not to say anything. &quot;You look nothing like her,&quot; 
Lilith said with a laugh. &quot;Except for the hair, maybe. So, did you steal that sword from 
Alice&#39;s dead body after Miki told you what we did to them? Or maybe you found Mariah&#39;s 
spell book and Alice&#39;s diary? Just who the hell are you?&quot;

      As much as Miki wanted to give Lilith a piece of her mind, this wasn&#39;t the time or 
the place for revenge... Alice, Mariah and the real Miki... She had to fight to save Eveon 
now, not for the dead. The blue green energy swirled violently around her, surprising 
Lilith.

      Except for the color, she recognized it as the same power that she herself possessed. 
How was that even possible? &quot;Well, if it&#39;s a fight you want...&quot; Lilith said as her own 
powers began to manifest.

      Eveon, on the other hand, had tripped in the forest and was now sitting on her butt. 
Great. The blonde was sure she wasn&#39;t cut out for outrunning fiends or participating in 
battles that could change the course of history... she just wanted to go home, go to school 
and eat her mommy&#39;s food.

      &quot;Oh my... you&#39;re even more adorable than I thought!&quot;

      Eveon jumped to her feet at the sound of a creepy female voice. &quot;I guess you do have 
the sight,&quot; Pandora said, walking towards her. &quot;Or else you wouldn&#39;t have heard me right 
now.&quot;

      &quot;Uh-huh...&quot; the blonde said dully, backing away.

      The fiend just giggled. &quot;You can call me Pandora... I really wish I could make you my 
Death Doll now, but I can&#39;t.&quot;

      Eveon let out a huge sigh of relief. &quot;Really? Thank goodness!&quot;

      &quot;Well, not until the Seal of Light becomes the actual Key to God,&quot; Pandora added, 
motioning to Eveon&#39;s right hand with her cane. &quot;Only when you have the motivation and 
desire to open the door to the Creator... that&#39;s when it will become the key. Otherwise, 
our temporary master Adrian won&#39;t be able to use you to open the Gate. If I turn you into a 
doll now, the seal will never transform.&quot;

      The blonde looked down at her hand. Good thing she didn&#39;t want to open the gate in 
the first place...

      &quot;You can tell Adrian that this seal isn&#39;t going to be turning into a key,&quot; Eveon said 
definitively. &quot;I have no intention of unlocking the power of God or Creator, or whatever it 
is.&quot;

      Pandora just giggled again. &quot;Of course, silly! That&#39;s why I decided to bring you some 
motivation.&quot;

      The gray haired fiend disappeared briefly behind the trees before leading someone by 
the hand to stop in front of Eveon. The blonde&#39;s heart stopped, hoping she wasn&#39;t seeing 
what was in front of her.

      It was a Death Doll, wearing a pretty black dress and white mask with a wing painted 
on it. Eveon took a staggering breath as she recognized the ebony hair and the girl&#39;s 
figure. &quot;You... how could you!&quot;

      Pandora frowned slightly. &quot;What? Do you not like her dress? I think it suits Mina 
very well.&quot;

      As soon as that name crossed the fiend&#39;s lips, it really hit Eveon that her 
girlfriend was gone. &quot;Please! Pandora, can&#39;t you undo it! I&#39;d... I would do whatever you 
want, but can&#39;t you leave Mina out of this?&quot;

      The fiend shook her head with a smile. &quot;The process is irreversible.&quot;

      Eveon sunk to her knees, needing to sit down. It took all of five seconds for her to 
start crying, mad and upset about it all. How could this happen to Mina? She&#39;d never done 
anything besides be her girlfriend and now...

      &quot;There&#39;s a way for you to be together,&quot; Pandora said cheerfully. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to 
be with Mina?&quot;

      Eveon wiped at her tears, bitter. &quot;What can I do?&quot;

      &quot;If you opened the gate to the Creator, Adrian will give me the power to turn my 
dolls into fiends... once Mina becomes a fiend, you can be together... and you can be a 
fiend too, Eveon.&quot; The blonde gaped at her.

      &quot;Are you insane? Why would I... I...&quot;

      &quot;Or you can leave Mina as a Death Doll for me to play with,&quot; Pandora said, still 
smiling. &quot;Why don&#39;t you come with me, Eveon? I&#39;m sure Mina will bake you that chocolate 
cake you like so much.&quot;

      Eveon couldn&#39;t take the mockery of their special moment and sprung to her feet. She 
leaped at Pandora, the Seal of Light blazing. The fiend calmly raised up her cane and 
smacked Eveon away, her dark energy neutralizing the seal.

      &quot;I know you love her,&quot; Pandora started. &quot;But you needn&#39;t be so violent. If you desire 
to save her, you&#39;ll open the gate.&quot;

      Eveon pushed herself up off of the dirt with a groan. It would be so easy to just 
give up... but... Mina...

      Pandora quickly turned to the side and deflected a fireball directed right at her. It 
smashed into the trees, dissolving into nothing as though it hadn&#39;t been made of flames. A 
figure stopped in front of Pandora and the fiend pursed her lips in annoyance.

      Eveon looked to see who it was and was once again confused. It was Sakura... but at 
the same time, it was the Living Inferno...?

      The white haired woman was standing in front of Pandora, red eyes blazing in anger. 
She was wearing the same mask over the bottom half of her face that changed her voice, but 
the only other piece of armor she had was a metal gauntlet on her left hand.

      Eveon humorously supposed that Sakura had rushed to put on her Living Inferno outfit, 
but maybe left a few pieces behind. The only other thing she was wearing was a torn black 
dress... how odd. &quot;You&#39;re a lot stronger than you used to be,&quot; Pandora noted, keeping Mina 
behind her.

      Sakura didn&#39;t respond as fire raged up around her. Without a moment&#39;s notice, the 
flames manifested into a scythe that she brought down mercilessly against Pandora. The 
fiend barely blocked with her cane, her dark energy bending and crackling beneath the 
scythe&#39;s power. Pandora managed to push it away before grabbing Mina by the hand and 
escaping quickly in a whorl of darkness.

      The Living Inferno&#39;s scythe dissipated into nothing more than smoke as Eveon settled 
for sitting down on the dirt again, crying a little more softly. Sakura quickly went to her 
and scooped her up in her arms. &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; the raspy voice said. Even though it sent 
shivers down her spine because of its gravelly sound, it was familiar and comforting. The 
armored hand rubbing her back seemed ever softer because Eveon knew it was Sakura trying to 
calm her down.

      Eveon flinched as Sakura burst into flames, but the fire seemed to go back inside the 
white haired woman&#39;s body, the two armor pieces disappearing in the smoke. &quot;Come on... 
let&#39;s get going...&quot;

      In a different part of the forest, Tsuki fell backwards after attempting to use her 
immense holy power on Solomon. Hina and Hoshi quickly went over to her. &quot;Are you alright?!&quot; 
The blonde asked.

      &quot;Y-yes,&quot; Tsuki said shakily as Hoshi helped her up.

      Solomon let out a sigh, sheathing his sword. &quot;While this has been fun, I&#39;m afraid I 
have to get going.&quot; He bowed before walking off into the forest.

      &quot;We need to go find Eveon,&quot; Hina said, springing up.

      &quot;Not so fast,&quot; Hoshi murmured before making sure Tsuki was alright to stand on her 
own. &quot;I sense a very interesting presence nearby.&quot;

      Hina tilted her head in confusion - she&#39;d never been good at sensing things. &quot;It... 
It feels like... Sakura... but different,&quot; Tsuki said, trying to wrap her mind around it.

      &quot;The Living Inferno,&quot; Hoshi said simply. &quot;Let&#39;s go meet up with Miki... they must 
have gotten separated.&quot;

      As they were racing to Miki, the young girl was facing off against Lilith. The purple 
haired vixen was getting more and more frustrated with her. Miki was matching blow to blow 
with that mysterious power of hers and it didn&#39;t help that the Demon Buster was cancelling 
out some of Lilith&#39;s powers.

      &quot;How did you get this power?&quot; Lilith asked.

      Miki refused to answer as she swung at the woman who was flying up. Lilith gritted 
her teeth in frustration at the bluish green wings that formed at the younger girl&#39;s back. 
&quot;You&#39;ve got to be shitting me!&quot;

      The green eyed girl winced at Lilith&#39;s foul mouth, but charged at her ferociously, 
her energy blazing. &quot;Are you some kind of experiment too?! Who are you?!&quot; She asked as she 
blocked Miki&#39;s sword with her own energy formed ones.

      Their eyes locked and Lilith hesitated as something odd dawned on her. Before she 
could figure out exactly who the girl was, Miki let out a cry as she was shot down from the 
air by a blast of dark energy. She landed in some bushes with a loud thud and Lilith looked 
down to see Solomon.

      &quot;It&#39;s time to leave,&quot; he said.

      &quot;Not before I figure out who that bitch is!&quot; Lilith growled out, landing gracefully 
on the ground. As she turned to the unconscious Miki, Solomon grabbed her arm.

      &quot;I said, it&#39;s time to go, unless you would like the Living Inferno to pay you a 
visit,&quot; Solomon said, keeping his tone stern.

      Lilith frowned and rolled her eyes. &quot;Fine. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

      They disappeared together thanks to Solomon&#39;s ability of transportation a few minutes 
before Hoshi and her sisters got to the clearing. The oldest of the three immediately 
spotted Miki in the bushes a few feet away.

      &quot;Miki!&quot; Hina cried out, hurrying over. Tsuki followed behind her younger sister, just 
as worried. It was at times like this that Hoshi wished she had healing abilities... thank 
goodness Eveon had the Seal of Light.

      &quot;Let me grab her,&quot; Hoshi whispered, picking up Miki tenderly. She was bleeding in a 
few places, but it all looked superficial.

      &quot;I have a place where we can stay,&quot; came a soft voice. All three looked over to see 
Sakura and Eveon, who was clinging to the older woman and embarrassedly trying to wipe away 
her tears.
