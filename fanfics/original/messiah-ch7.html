Chronicle Seven - a village called Green Cloud

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Below the stone gardens and rock precinct of the Temple of Tlazolteotl 
was the small but very important research facility of Holy Protocol&#39;s 
biotechnological experiments. It had been built just after the former 
Protocol took over the temple, this being one of the places on earth 
that contained information and relics from the ancient human 
civilization born from the Novus Deus. The research station was just 
over thirty metres underground and had to be reached via a small lift. 
In one of those padded, purely white rooms, Freeman Ronove sat upon a 
sole metal chair. His eyes were closed and his head drooped slightly. 
Cables and wires were hooked certain points of his flesh, connected by 
small probes entering his veins. Those cables trailed to the white 
ground and ran through the wall.  Which was the point at which those 
cables connected to a secondary computer in a separate room. That 
computer had visual screens on it. Each one regulating or monitoring a 
certain piece of data extracted from Freeman. Heart rate, blood 
pressure, brainwaves, breathing patterns; etc. But more importantly, 
they measured Freeman&#39;s overall Qi-Level. And it had jumped to a level 
that the scientists observing him couldn&#39;t understand. 

Three Holy Protocolian men, each of them in white coats, worked on 
gathering data from Freeman. Scientist #1 sat beside the computer, 
gathering the information being fed to his terminal from Freeman&#39;s room. 
The other two, Scientists #2 and #3 watched Freeman&#39;s reaction through 
the one-way glass window of lab. Though the readings they were getting 
were immense, his expression was so calm and conserved. 

Scientist #3 looked over at the computers from the window. &quot;What&#39;s the 
status on his Qi-Level? Is it stronger than it was at Ix Nos Babel?&quot;

&quot;This is amazing,&quot; Scientist #1 remarked, &quot;his vital signs are all 
average. And yet is Qi-Level is simply gigantic. It&#39;s ranking in at over 
4,900 without synchronization with the Raum Meta Suit. If he were to 
pilot it now... he&#39;d have Qi-Level of over 31,000 units. At the very 
least. His symbiosis was completely successful.&quot;

&quot;The Heart of the Astaroth, huh?&quot; Scientist #2 said, &quot;This boy does seem 
to capture the image of it. Those big-wigs at the Ochiai Underground 
Research Facility won&#39;t have all the glory now.&quot;

Scientist #3 nodded. &quot;Maybe. Still. I can&#39;t help but wonder why the 
Heart of the Astaroth is synonymous with this one. He is the Thanatos. 
Where in the Tablets of Destiny does it say that Eros and Thanatos can 
achieve that state?&quot;

&quot;Maybe there&#39;s more we don&#39;t know about them,&quot; Scientist #1 stated, 
&quot;don&#39;t forget that at least 30% of the Tablets eroded through time. This 
could be just another one of those mysteries. And since we can no longer 
continue experimentation on Princess Ashura, what better way to study 
the properties of the Astaroth&#39;s Heart?&quot;

Scientist #2 mused the idea. &quot;Oh well. At least we have this data. We 
can think about the reasons once we&#39;ve finished the job here. Besides. 
He has a pretty important mission now, too.&quot;

The third scientist then spoke into a microphone by the window of the 
room. It amplified his voice so that it could be heard through both 
rooms, by Freeman. &quot;Well done, Mister Ronove. We have all the data we 
need. You should prepare for the attack on the village of Green Cloud 
now.&quot;

Freeman slowly opened his eyes and beamed another powerful grin. He 
grabbed the cables in his arms, legs, skull and chest, then pulled them 
all out. He dropped them to the floor and stood up, smoothing out his 
Aztec-like robes. Freeman walked to the far door of the room and tapped 
a few codes into the keypad. The automatic door then opened for him. 
Freeman walked out of the laboratory into a separate corridor, then 
turned to the left towards the Meta Suit hangar. On his way down the 
corridor, the eyes of the Thanatos narrowed out on a man standing just a 
short ways ahead of him. A man dressed in a similar white coat to the 
others. This man pulled a small smile and adjusted his glasses, looking 
to be no more than 29 years of age.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Said the man, &quot;would you happen to be Freeman Ronove, the 
&#39;Thanatos&#39; of this present generation?&quot;

Freeman stopped walking. &quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;...I have gone by many names. For now... you can call me... Doctor 
Geist Fahlem.&quot;

&quot;So, Doctor Fahlem,&quot; Freeman began, &quot;what do you want of me?&quot;

Dr. Fahlem smirked. &quot;Now, now. There is no need for that kind of tone. I 
am not an enemy of yours. Although there is any enemy of yours out 
there, isn&#39;t there? But just who is that enemy, I wonder?&quot;

&quot;Are you speaking of Eros?&quot; The Thanatos asked.

&quot;Possibly.&quot;

&quot;What can you know of us?&quot; Freeman questioned, &quot;We are the children of 
destiny, selected by divine right to lead this planet to its fullest 
destiny. I am more than a puny human like you could ever hope to 
contemplate. Just as Eros is.&quot;

Dr. Fahlem smiled ominously, running a hand through his ponytail. &quot;...Is 
that so? Those are awfully powerful words from someone with blood that 
remains tainted by the second of all sins. Do you consider yourself to 
be God&#39;s avatar in this state?&quot;

Freeman narrowed his eyes. &quot;...What do you mean...?&quot;

&quot;The failure of the last reunion,&quot; Geist put forth, &quot;should be proof 
enough of it. As well as the fact that you, of all people, are able to 
achieve symbiosis with the Heart of the Astaroth itself. Doesn&#39;t that 
intrigue you? Such a thing proves your impurity, does it not?&quot;

A growl escaped Freeman&#39;s lips. &quot;...Miserable human. Do you presume to 
doubt my worthiness in the eyes of God...!?&quot;

&quot;In the &#39;Eyes of God&#39;...? Well, I wouldn&#39;t know about that. What I do 
know is that the word &#39;dispensability&#39; is as much of a description of 
your present role as any other. It is a pity then, that you choose to 
ignore that. Because your power would be a great asset in the new 
world.&quot;

Freeman ignored the comments about his &#39;dispensability&#39; to focus on the 
last thing that Dr. Fahlem had said. Something about the &#39;new world&#39;. 
What did he mean by that? &quot;...New world...?&quot;

&quot;In the darkness of the present,&quot; Fahlem began, &quot;the Three Wise Men 
shall install their faith into three stars of providence, smiled upon by 
fate. One star is the leader. The star of the north. The star that shall 
guide the new race. The second star is the bringer of death, the one who 
shall cleave the world in the image of God&#39;s true nature. And the final 
star is the redeemer, the one destined to bring about this planet&#39;s 
ultimate destiny. Fate is already in movement to bring these three stars 
to their true purpose. Once the Third Offering is given to the spirit of 
God... they shall be the fulcrum to which our vocations will dance. The 
one you regard as Eros, Yumi Mishima, happens to be one of those stars. 
But would it frighten you to know, Mister Freeman Ronove... that you are 
NOT one of those stars...?&quot;

Freeman scowled, swinging his arm to one side. &quot;What are you talking 
about!? Who are you!? Why do you tell me these things!?&quot;

Dr. Fahlem chuckled to himself, wrapping his arms under each other. He 
then walked forwards, ignoring Freeman&#39;s higher tone of voice. Though 
Freeman had the Qi energy to crush his body like a grape, Dr. Geist 
Fahlem showed no fear whatsoever. But as he left Freeman&#39;s earshot, he 
whispered quietly, &quot;Go onwards, Thanatos. You still have a duty to 
fulfil in the present world, regardless. So continue your path. But 
eventually you will learn... just how worthless you really are...&quot;

&quot;...RAIN HARLAND...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;...Ugh...&quot;

Rain groaned tiredly. His body just felt... worn out. Which was probably 
why he felt so rested. The eyes of the young man fluttered open. He 
could feel softness around him, under his head and around his torso. 
Which he knew to be a pillow and blanket. Rain opened his eyes fully and 
absorbed the sight of himself in bed. He looked to his right and peered 
out the window with a glance. His Syoga Meta Suit was standing outside 
of this homestead with its rusty body bathed in moonlight. Behind his 
Syoga were two other Meta Suits. The Bishamon M-2 and the Oriax. Which 
was when Rain remembered the events at the beginning of the evening. 
Green Cloud village had been attacked by sentries from the Holy Empire 
of Protocol. They were led by General Selena Fol, the new leader of the 
Divine Blade. Rain had seen off one of them, while two others were taken 
down by the Bishamon and Oriax Meta Suits. Selena had then fled with her 
last cohort, and escaped the village. After having a short conversation 
with the pilots of those two suits, Rain remembered himself passing out. 
Fighting in the mecha was a taxing process on him. Not because the act 
itself was difficult, but rather because of the burning sensation that 
he experienced during piloting. Even in training/practicing sessions, 
that hot burning wave in his body was present. It was one of the many 
reasons that Rain hated piloting Syoga. Every time he felt that burning, 
it seemed as if a  tide was about to swallow him up. Like a void was 
opening beneath his feet and he had to struggle to stop himself from 
being eaten alive by it. Whatever the reason, Rain hoped that he could 
avoid that feeling by avoiding piloting in general. While it wasn&#39;t a 
foolish choice... Rain, in his heart, knew that he couldn&#39;t ignore the 
call of the battlefield forever. Not even if he wanted to.

Rain slowly rose up, pressing his back against the headboard of the bed 
he was in. He then looked around. The pink paint of the walls and the 
plush teddy bears littering the carpeted floor of the room, proved who 
it belonged to. Edwina. Though she was a tomboy in spirit, she had very 
feminine tastes when it came to the decoration of her room. It was just 
one of the odd things about her character. When Rain found himself 
thinking about that, the door into the room opened. Edwina walked in 
with a damp cloth in her hand.

The moment she saw Rain, she smiled. &quot;Rain! You&#39;re awake! Geez, you&#39;ve 
been out like a light for practically five hours, you moron! D&#39;you wanna 
make a habit of scaring me like that?!&quot;

&quot;Sorry...&quot; Rain said sheepishly.

Edwina pulled a wide smile and plopped down on the bed that was hers. 
&quot;...What am I gonna do with you, huh? You&#39;re a difficult boy, Rain 
Harland. But at least you&#39;re up and about now. Take this.&quot;

Edwina handed the wet cloth over to Rain. The boy took it into his own 
hands and blinked. &quot;What am I supposed to do with this?&quot;

&quot;Hold it to your forehead, genius. It&#39;ll cool down that fever you have.&quot;

Rain nodded and pressed the cloth against his forehead. It did have a 
cooling effect. It was then that he remembered how good Edwina was at 
taking care of this sort of thing. She was always a warm, motherly 
person at heart, even if she had a masculine temperament to her. If she 
had been born in a Meta City, she probably would have been absorbed into 
a nursing job. Such a thing came naturally to Edwina. 

The brown-haired teen smiled at her friend. &quot;There you go. If you listen 
to me, Rain, you&#39;ll never be steered wrong. Just... do me a favour, 
alright?&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t... push yourself too hard in those Meta Suits. You&#39;re not a god, 
you know. Even someone as good at piloting Meta Suits as you is gonna 
get overworked at some point. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is... chill 
out, a little. I don&#39;t want you to, y&#39;know, get hurt or something.&quot;

Rain pulled another tiny smile. &quot;...Edwina...&quot;

&quot;I mean it, you know?&quot; The girl stated, &quot;Now hurry on up. Those two 
people who helped you fight of those Protocol guys are downstairs. And 
they have someone else with them, too.&quot;

&quot;You mean Yumi and Terry?&quot; Asked Rain.

Edwina shrugged. &quot;I guess that&#39;s them. Do you know them?&quot;

&quot;...Not... really. They introduced themselves... after the fight. I 
suppose I should go down there and thank them for their help... against 
Protocol.&quot;

Rain sighed, and then removed the cold cloth he had pressed against his 
head. He then slid out of the pink blankets of Edwina&#39;s bed and stood 
upright. The silver-haired boy walked over to the door and opened it, 
with Edwina following closely behind him. The two walked across the 
landing and down the stairs of the house. Once they got to the ground 
floor they both turned a right and walked into the dining hall/living 
area. In the centre of the sparsely decorated room was a thick oak 
table. Sitting around the table were four people. One of them Rain knew. 
A middle-aged man by the name of Kurt Saffron, the father of Edwina. The 
other three was a white-haired Japanese girl, a blonde boy of 
European/American descent and a young woman with glasses and a 
non-Protocolian military outfit. Rain had not seen the faces of the two 
pilots who had saved him, but he guessed that blonde boy was Terry, and 
one of the two girls was Yumi.

Terry spoke first. &quot;You&#39;re Rain, right? Nice to meet you in the flesh. 
I&#39;m Terry. The pilot of that red suit you saw before. This girl sitting 
beside me is Yumi, the one who was operating the white suit.&quot;

Yumi nodded to Rain. &quot;Hi.&quot;

Rain nodded back. &quot;...H-hello.&quot;

&quot;And this,&quot; Terry looked to the other side of the table, &quot;is Major 
Sophia Mariette. She&#39;s one of my superiors, and she just had to come 
down with us.&quot;

Sophia smiled at Terry. &quot;You know you want me here, Lieutenant. Who else 
would clear up your messes, hm? In any case, it&#39;s very nice to meet you, 
Mister Rain Harland. I&#39;ve been monitoring the events here and... I was 
extremely impressed by your piloting skills. Not many people could 
defeat an Amon-type suit with an outdated model like yours.&quot;

Rain blushed bashfully. &quot;I-it was nothing... r-really...&quot;

&quot;Eddie, Rain,&quot; Kurt said, &quot;sit down. These people have important 
business.&quot;

Edwina and Rain nodded and sat down by the table, drawing chairs for 
themselves. Once the two were seated, Edwina&#39;s mother, Bella Saffron, 
came out from the side entrance into the kitchen with a tray in hand. On 
that tray were six mugs of coffee. She placed each one of them before a 
seated person around the table and then wafted back into the kitchen 
with the tray. Sophia took a sip from the coffee mug and then placed it 
down. 

To say, &quot;Thank you for having us for the time being, Mr. Saffron. I know 
we must be unconvincing you right now.&quot;

&quot;Not at all,&quot; Kurt replied, &quot;you helped Rain fend off those Protocolian 
scum. That alone earns you my gratitude. This is the very least I can do 
to repay you.&quot;

Yumi let her coffee cool down before she sipped it. &quot;That wasn&#39;t the end 
of it. They will be coming back. I suspect that they deployed that team 
for scouting purposes. I can&#39;t pretend to know why the Divine Blade 
would send their leader for such a small job, but...&quot;

Kurt blinked. &quot;But what could they want with Green Cloud? I know that 
the Meta Cities are deeply opposed to the existence of outside villages 
and towns, but, this is just a small locale. We pose no threat to any of 
the Meta Cities. In fact the only reason we possess Meta Suits is for 
protection in cases like these.&quot;

Terry gulped some of his coffee before saying, &quot;Try not to think about 
it like that. In any way, shape or form, Protocol would have attacked 
this place. But this time there is a real reason for them to interfere.&quot;

&quot;Which is?&quot; Edwina prodded. 

&quot;Your town was built over something rather special,&quot; Sophia said, &quot;an 
underground set of tunnels and caverns that are interconnected with a 
nearby Protocolian complex. It is called the Northern American Sky Cord. 
It&#39;s basically a means of reaching space. It seems that Holy Protocol 
wants to take over the NASC to get themselves to orbit.&quot;

Kurt held a hand to his chin. &quot;Orbit? Why?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not really sure,&quot; Terry stated, &quot;but what we do know is that 
there&#39;s one hell of a powerful cannon up there. If the Holy Empire of 
Protocol gets their hands on that thing then this war&#39;s over.&quot;

&quot;So they&#39;re attacking Green Cloud to get to the tunnels that will lead 
them to this &#39;Sky Cord&#39; gizmo? With which they can make it into outer 
space?&quot; Kurt wondered.

Yumi nodded. &quot;That&#39;s the case. Though we can&#39;t be sure just what they 
plan on doing with the AM-Cannon, we do know that it wouldn&#39;t bode well 
for us. I&#39;ve dealt with it before, believe me when I say that it will 
spell doom for the world if it is ever to be put into activation again. 
So we&#39;ve got to stop Holy Protocol from getting into space. By securing 
the Sky Cord, we can do that.&quot;

Edwina narrowed her eyes. &quot;But wouldn&#39;t that drag Green Cloud into your 
conflicts?&quot;

&quot;They aren&#39;t just ours,&quot; Stated Sophia, &quot;this battle will effect the 
whole world. And had we come here or not, Green Cloud would have been 
pulled into the struggle regardless. Though it might be hard for you to 
accept... this village is in danger.&quot;

&quot;So why have you come here?&quot; Kurt asked, &quot;to defend the village or stop 
Protocol?&quot;

Terry waved his hand. &quot;...Well, both really. We might seem dangerous, 
but trust me, us Chrysalis members are more considerate for people than 
either of the Protocol factions are. Of course... New Protocol will have 
to get involved too.&quot;

Edwina rested her cheek on her palm, her elbow propping her up. &quot;So this 
village is gonna be a war zone soon, is that what you&#39;re telling us?&quot;

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Sophia said, &quot;we&#39;re trying very hard to keep the battles 
out of the range of the village. That you can be sure of. Like 
Lieutenant Hennig said, we are a lot more considerate for the feelings 
and needs of the villagers outside of Protocol&#39;s influence than most 
military factions. We will do all we can to keep the battle away from 
your homes and lives. We just wanted to warn all people concerned in 
case something in that vein actually did happen.&quot;

&quot;Understood. I&#39;ll warn the elders and the townsfolk about this,&quot; Kurt 
stated, right before he looked over at Rain, &quot;you&#39;ll probably need to 
help these people in the Syoga, Rain. Can you do it?&quot;

The silver-haired boy looked downwards, remaining silent. It was obvious 
to everyone (especially Yumi) that Rain did not enjoy fighting. But he 
didn&#39;t seem to have the strength of will to ignore the suffering of 
others, either. Edwina gazed at the quiet boy and then looked back at 
her father with ire. &quot;Daddy! Rain shouldn&#39;t be fighting now! He just 
woke up from that last battle.&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s okay... Edwina,&quot; Rain assured, timidly, &quot;...I know my duty to 
you and... the village. I have to fight... to protect it. I can&#39;t turn 
my back on that...&quot;

Edwina cast her concerned eyes upon her friend. &quot;...But Rain, I...&quot;

&quot;Let the boy do as he wishes, Eddie,&quot; Ordered Kurt, &quot;this is bigger than 
all of us. And we can&#39;t afford to waste time talking over the minute 
details. We have to get this message of danger to the people of Green 
Cloud. Then we must do all we can to stop the Holy Empire of Protocol 
and defend this village at the same time.&quot;

&quot;I see that,&quot; Yumi stated, &quot;...but one thing still bothers me.&quot;

Terry turned to her, drinking his coffee. &quot;What&#39;s that, Yumi?&quot;

&quot;When we were battling against Selena and her troops, one of them said 
&#39;anyone who denies the will of &#39;Princess Ashura&#39; will be destroyed&#39;.&quot;

Sophia held a fingertip to her chin, curiously. &quot;...Princess Ashura? 
Who&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I want to know,&quot;  Yumi said, &quot;I&#39;ve always believed that 
there was a higher will than that of either Celaph or the Upper Council 
when it came to Protocol. And I once remember Celaph stating something 
about the &#39;Triad of the Inquisition&#39;. Three prophets who back Protocol 
from the shadows. I think there might be a connection.&quot;

Sophia adjusted her glasses. &quot;A higher will than Celaph and the Council? 
You think that this Ashura person may have taken on that role?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Yumi put forth, &quot;it makes sense if you think about it. When 
Protocol was a whole entity, the Triad of the Inquisition didn&#39;t command 
the organization themselves for some reason. They needed representatives 
like Celaph to fulfil that purpose. It should be the same now as it ever 
was. Which means...&quot;

Terry filled in the gaps. &quot;...That this &#39;Princess Ashura&#39; chick is the 
new figurehead for Holy Protocol? Is that what you&#39;re saying Yumi?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I think so.&quot;

&quot;...I better get this information to Colonel Beatrix,&quot; Sophia added, 
&quot;you two stay here and give Mr. Saffron all the help he needs in 
convincing the townspeople of the threat that faces them. I&#39;m going back 
to the Leviathan for now.&quot;

 ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Just three and half miles west of Green Cloud was a small encampment. 
Well small enough in terms of Meta Suits. It was an encampment under the 
banner of the Holy Empire of Protocol. But more importantly, it was an 
outdoor encampment for the Divine Blade militia. Fifteen tents had been 
set up in the fertile grass fields. Around forty men and women, all of 
them operatives for the Divine Blade, buzzed in and around those tents. 
Just a short distance from the tents were the Meta Suits themselves. 
Around thirty of them. Three being Zagan-types, the other thirty six 
being Amons. One other was joining them, though. That mecha was the 
Morax, the suit belonging to the current leader of the Divine Blade, 
Selena Fol. The troops stationed here were the beef of the attacking 
forces against the village of Green Cloud. 

Selena sat on a wooden chair in the main (and therefore the largest) 
tent. It was a standard set up for a temporary base of action. It had a 
table, a personal laptop, a folding spring bed, a mini-fridge for the 
storing of food and a desk to work from. This was where Selena&#39;s troops 
would be spending the night. And though she didn&#39;t like the idea of 
camping out in the wilderness like an animal, she couldn&#39;t do much about 
it. Orders were orders, even for the leader of the most feared military 
division in the world. 

Night had fallen. And now everyone was preparing for sleep, aside for 
those who would be spending the night during a petrol over the area. The 
only one who didn&#39;t concern herself with that was General Selena Fol 
herself. Dressed only in her elastic black two-piece underwear, Selena 
strode up to her wooden desk and sat down by it. She crossed one of her 
long legs over the other and sighed, then reached her fingers out for 
the keypad of her laptop. Once she opened a few files, a wire diagram of 
the Oriax came on screen. Selena eyed over the specs for the suit as 
well as its shape and design.

&quot;So this is the one, huh?&quot; Selena remarked, &quot;the Meta Suit that 
destroyed the Eon and blocked the attacks of the AM-Cannon. Three of 
them, no less. That Oriax is a work of art... if I had such a Meta Suit 
in my hands... I know I could start an even greater legacy than that of 
General Naam... but that damn Yumi Mishima...&quot;

On the screen of her computer, something flashed. Selena moved her mouse 
over it and clicked. The blip then shot up into a small visual window. 
One that was being beamed to her laptop all the way from Middle America, 
no less. And Selena knew what that meant. It was from the &#39;Holy 
Protocolian Palace&#39;. The girl on the window was proof of that much. That 
girl happened to be Leena Fol.

Selena smiled at the computer screen with a sigh. &quot;Hey there, sis. Miss 
me?&quot;

&quot;As ever,&quot; Leena replied, &quot;I can&#39;t believe the report we just got from 
your end. Were your troops really seen off by the Oriax?&quot;

&quot;Yup. No doubt about it. If any confusions still remained about that 
Mishima girl&#39;s standing in all of this then they&#39;re all done and dusted 
now. There&#39;s no doubt left that she&#39;s working with Chrysalis. And if 
they&#39;re in America... then they must be aware of our intentions. That&#39;s 
the way I see it.&quot;

Leena nodded on screen. &quot;We see that too. That&#39;s why there&#39;s been a 
slight change of plans regarding that issue.&quot;

&quot;A change of plans?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Leena started, &quot;they come directly from Her Highness. You and 
your section of the Divine Blade forces are not to attack Green Cloud. 
Do you understand? You have to cancel your attack.&quot;

Selena blinked. &quot;A-are you kidding me?!&quot;

&quot;...Calm down, Selena. You and your team will still be deployed. But not 
for the village. You will go straight to the underground complex to make 
it to the Sky Cord. I&#39;m sending the coordinates to you as soon as we 
can.&quot;

&quot;But what about Chrysalis?&quot; Argued the General, &quot;we can&#39;t just let them 
roam around as they like while my team are securing the North American 
Sky Cord. And with the Oriax down here, we can&#39;t afford to make any 
mistakes.&quot;

Leena nodded. &quot;We realize that. But we have that issue taken care of. 
You just focus on getting the Sky Cord under control before New 
Protocolian troops intercede. I&#39;m counting on you, sis.&quot;

&quot;Leave it to me,&quot; Selena said, &quot;though I would have loved to settle 
things with the ones who killed Master Naam... orders are orders. The 
Divine Blade have everything under control.&quot;

Leena smiled warmly at her sister. &quot;My god, you&#39;re even starting to 
sound militaristic. I wonder who you get that from, hm?&quot;

&quot;He was a brilliant man,&quot; Selena mused, thinking back, &quot;...our 
Father...&quot;

&quot;I can understand your need for revenge. And I promise you, you shall 
have the chance, Selena. But for now, the main objective is to make it 
into space. Once we do that, your role is over. And you can seek out the 
one who killed our father.&quot; 

&quot;Can do.&quot; Selena tapped her fingers on the desk, &quot;well, I suppose you 
gotta get going now. You&#39;ve got a lot of responsibilities at the Temple 
now. And I know that it can&#39;t be easy having to act as your own 
girlfriend&#39;s second.&quot;

Even through that hazy visual feed, Selena could see the scarlet red 
blush rising on Leena&#39;s cheeks when she replied to that. &quot;...We still 
don&#39;t get to spend much time together. But I&#39;m seeing Ashura later on to 
brief her about what happened with your group. I&#39;ll tell her you said 
hello.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. Take care of yourself, Leena.&quot; The older girl said.

Leena nodded. &quot;You too. Bye.&quot;

The visual image went off screen. Leena had signed off. Selena sighed, 
then leaned back in her chair, thinking about the past. Much had changed 
since she and Leena had joined Protocol. Selena herself had only wanted 
to be a pilot in the Divine Blade, to follow in the footsteps of her 
Father, Captain Harvey Fol. She had even gone so far as to receive Meta 
Suit training from none other than General Naam. But ever since the 
appearance of the Oriax and Yumi Mishima, not to mention the traitorous 
actions of Commander William Ank Celaph, things had gone so wrong. 
Revenge for the factors that had brought all this about was one of the 
few things that Selena had left in life. Once she took care of the Sky 
Cord issue, she would deal with her other &#39;problem&#39;.

&quot;I&#39;ll destroy that suit,&quot; Selena mumbled acutely, &quot;I&#39;ll destroy that 
suit no matter what the cost to myself.&quot; 
 
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

By now it was midnight in Green Cloud, Texas. The full was full and at 
its highest. The stars were sparkling down on the world from heaven 
along with it. You always got a good view of the stars from outside the 
Meta Cities. Green Cloud was no exception to that rule. Rain sat alone 
on the thatched roof of the Saffron Household. It was an unusual place 
to relax but he felt fine here. From this point, Rain could see the 
whole of the expanse of the village. He could see local well, the town 
square, the market, the museum, the crop fields, the town hall, the 
elder&#39;s mansion residence, and the old Meta Suit storage warehouse; as 
well as the many residential buildings of the townsfolk. All of the 
windows were lit by the flames of their candles, and in some cases, the 
electricity they managed to salvaged from a nearby power plant (long 
abandoned by the Meta Cities). It was a nice place. And Rain often found 
himself admiring it.

The silver-haired boy sighed, pulling his legs up closer to him. He then 
wrapped his arms around them, sitting on the elevated roof in a kind of 
foetal position. The cool wind blew at him from the west, tossing his 
silvery bangs to one side of his forehead. All the while Rain stared out 
and marvelled at the town that he called home. Then all of a sudden, the 
flap-door built into the roof (which led up from the loft) opened. Rain 
didn&#39;t look back, just listened to that person shuffle up from the small 
compartment and step towards him. That person took a seat next to the 
pilot of the Syoga and breathed a sigh of relaxation.

That person was Yumi.

Rain turned to her. &quot;Miss Mishima?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to call me that,&quot; Yumi said, &quot;...it&#39;s just Yumi here.&quot;

&quot;Okay then. Yumi. Why...?&quot;

&quot;Did I come up here? I&#39;m not sure, really. Edwina said that you and she 
liked to come up to the roof of the house and stare at the town 
sometimes. I just felt like doing that myself. I guess I was expecting 
to run into you.&quot;

The young Rain lowered his head to his kneecaps. &quot;...Edwina and I often 
do this. Ever since we were children. When my parents died... she was 
there for me. More than anyone else. She told me to follow her here 
and... when I did look at the view, I found that it helped to calm me 
down a little. Edwina has always had the effect on me. She always knows 
how to handle me. Even when I&#39;m not so sure myself.&quot;

&quot;...So you grew up without parents?&quot; Yumi asked.

Rain nodded. &quot;Uh huh.&quot;

&quot;Hm. I know how that feels...&quot; The Mishima girl stated. 

&quot;...Yumi?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not the only one,&quot; She answered, &quot;Terry also grew up without 
parents. Well, for at least the majority of his life. I think... that&#39;s 
why we understand each other. And why... I think of him as my one true 
friend. But... I suppose it&#39;s a little different for you and Edwina, 
right?&quot;

Rain watched Yumi&#39;s docile frown. &quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;Because you truly care for each other. I could see it in your eyes. And 
hers. I know what it&#39;s like to care for someone that way. And though my 
feelings for that person came to nothing, it&#39;s wonderful to be able to 
share such deep emotions with someone.&quot;

&quot;Why are you telling me this?&quot; Rain questioned.

Yumi shrugged. &quot;...I don&#39;t know, really. Maybe it&#39;s because it&#39;s nice to 
see two people who genuinely care for each other in a world such as 
this. Maybe it&#39;s because seeing you two with each other... reminds me of 
how I once felt. Or maybe... it&#39;s because... when I look in your eyes... 
I see myself in them.&quot;

Rain blinked, fluttering his long eyelashes. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re having doubts about fighting, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Yumi prodded, &quot;I can 
see how your heart aches at the thought of it. I was like that... 
before... a certain event, six months ago. I remember feeling so 
frightened at the thought of killing other human beings. And I remember 
how much the idea of being asked to kill people angered me. It&#39;s the 
same for you, isn&#39;t it? You hate fighting, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;...Yes,&quot; Though Rain wasn&#39;t the type to just open up to anyone, he 
responded, &quot;...I hate the battles. I hate the suffering. When I pilot 
the Syoga... I always feel this burning, rending sensation. Like 
something inside me is trying to swallow me whole or consume my soul. 
But I have to keep fighting. If not to protect Green Cloud then, to 
protect Edwina. As well as the things that are important to her. That is 
my only wish in life.&quot;

Yumi smirked in unhappily. &quot;...I guess that&#39;s the one thing we don&#39;t 
share.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m talking about a purpose. You find your purpose in defending 
Edwina and Green Cloud village from harm, even though it brings you pain 
to do so. But I&#39;m not like that. There are times when I... truly wonder 
why it is that I fight.&quot;

Rain continued to look downwards. &quot;...Have you spoken to anyone else... 
about this?&quot;

&quot;...No,&quot; Yumi replied, &quot;...I can&#39;t... face it. Everyone on the Leviathan 
has a purpose or a drive. A feeling of momentum or a will that they can 
call upon to allow them to fight. But what have I got compared to that? 
These days, I just... struggle to feel even the slightest inclination to 
an action. I only follow directions aimlessly to find myself and figure 
out why I do what I do. Is that any way for a person to live? To follow 
a path only for the knowledge of why I take it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know you... well enough... to comment on your life, Yumi. 
But... I can see that... you think a lot for others. How does the 
thought of... losing Terry or Sophia sound to you? How... does that make 
you feel?&quot;

Yumi searched her heart. &quot;...Awful.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe that&#39;s the reason,&quot; Rain suggested, &quot;I don&#39;t remember much 
about my parents. Not even what they looked like. But I do remember 
little things that my dad used to tell me, right before I went to sleep. 
He often said... that people with power forget their place. And then 
when they lose that place... they search for it. But the bigger picture 
wouldn&#39;t yield as much... as the smaller one. Sometimes... people with 
power have to settle themselves with what they do have... rather than 
what they don&#39;t have. When my father told me this... I think he was 
talking about Protocol. But I think that it suits us as well, Yumi. I 
don&#39;t want the power I have. I don&#39;t want to be a pilot. But I do want 
Edwina to be happy. And I can maintain that... by using this power that 
I have. I guess that that&#39;s the reality of it all. The only way to get 
on with life is make the most of the bad situations... and use to them 
to... reinforce the good.&quot;

Yumi smiled gently. &quot;...You&#39;re a sweet boy, Rain. I can see why Edwina 
likes you.&quot;

Once again, Rain blushed. &quot;...I... don&#39;t know about that...&quot;

&quot;Well, do you like her, too?&quot;

&quot;...Yes... very much,&quot; Rain replied, &quot;...more than I&#39;ve... ever told 
her...&quot;

&quot;I can remember what that feels like,&quot; Yumi said, &quot;I once had feelings 
for someone I couldn&#39;t really profess them to.&quot;

&quot;And what happened?&quot; Asked Rain, inquisitively. 

&quot;...Nothing. There was no point in telling her anything. She already 
knew how I felt. But by the time I realized that, it became obvious that 
it wouldn&#39;t matter. She betrayed me to Protocol. And broke my heart.&quot;

Rain&#39;s soft eyes looked down again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Yumi.&quot;

Yumi shook her head in reply. &quot;Don&#39;t apologize. I can&#39;t criticize her 
for doing what she did. Especially when I&#39;m doing the same thing to 
Terry even now.&quot;

&quot;...Terry?&quot;

&quot;...He won&#39;t say it, but...&quot; Yumi closed her eyes, &quot;...I know that he&#39;s 
in love with me. I know it. And yet I can&#39;t say to him that I don&#39;t feel 
the same way because I&#39;m just too cowardly. I hate the thought that I 
might lose him as a friend. Even if it means I have to toy with his 
feelings by ignoring them. When I think about things like that... I just 
know that I&#39;m unfit to be what I am. I&#39;ll keep hurting Terry as long as 
I fear for my relationship with him. And that alone negates my purpose 
in life, because... I don&#39;t have any right to want to protect him. I&#39;m 
still so... selfish.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The room of Princess Ashura&#39;s was the most exquisitely designed of all 
in the Temple of Tlazolteotl. It had been furnished with expensive 
items, imported from all over the world. Rugs from Kashmir, wall scrolls 
from Japan, ornamental masks from Middle Africa, a chandelier from 
Wales, and tables and chairs from Sweden. This was a representation of 
Holy Protocol&#39;s connections over the world. Very few people had their 
rooms decorated in such a way in this day and age. Not that Ashura was 
the type to complain about anything like that. 

The young woman sat on the large and soft bed of her room. Both of her 
legs hung of its edge, enswathed in the long materials of her 
Aztec/Chinese-inspired dress. Ashura sighed, looking out through the 
window across from her. Night was high in the air. It had been a long 
day today. First speaking with the Triad of the Inquisition, and then 
reforming her plans due to the insurgence of Yumi Mishima and the rest 
of the rebels. Dealing with these issues was always taxing. Maybe more 
so now than usual. It was important business they were dealing with now. 
And... more to the point... so many lives would have their fates decided 
by it. Princess Ashura could feel the weight of all that. But she 
couldn&#39;t say how she felt about it to anyone. Celaph had been branded a 
traitor for his diversion from the will of the Triad of the Inquisition. 
She could not allow that same fate for herself. There was no way she 
could offer her guidance to the will of the Triad if that were to occur. 
But still... that restrictive thing known as a conscience was playing on 
Ashura&#39;s mind. The heaviness in her wind emerald eyes showed that 
sentiment well. Suddenly the creaky wooden door to Ashura&#39;s right then 
opened. The sadness welling in the Princess&#39; eyes eased somewhat when 
she caught sight of the woman who was in the doorway.  Leena walked in, 
and closed the door behind her, locking it from the inside. Though 
Ashura had asked for her room&#39;s door not to have automatic capabilities, 
she also needed her privacy. Leena understood that better than anyone. 
But that was because she understood Ashura better than anyone else. The 
eighteen-year-old woman of lieutenant rank walked from the door over to 
Ashura&#39;s bed with a tiny smile on her face. Emphasized by the new 
privacy they now had from prying eyes. Leena sat down beside the older 
Princess, feeling the light springs of the bed compress with the 
addition of weight. The moment that the two looked at each other, the 
feelings between them were more than apparent. Leena reached out and 
touched upon Ashura&#39;s soft cheek with her hand. The chestnut-haired 
woman shut her eyes gently, absorbing the warmth of Leena&#39;s touch. And 
soon afterward their lips met. Both women sighed delicately at their 
kiss, sharing and enjoying a closeness with each other that would have 
been denied to them, had it been displayed in public. Ashura placed her 
hand on Leena&#39;s thigh, returning the kiss with equal passion, just until 
they separated. Leena pulled her lips from Ashura&#39;s, then resumed her 
minute smile.

The Princess smiled back. &quot;...Leena...&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ve wanted to do that all day,&quot; The lieutenant claimed, &quot;...I hate 
that we can only see each other like this. But I just...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Stated Ashura.

&quot;...I want to be closer to you, Ashura. I know that I can&#39;t have that... 
the way things are. That&#39;s why I want the war to be over soon. Once we 
make it into space... all this will be behind us. We can change the 
future ourselves.&quot;

Ashura&#39;s smile fell. &quot;But what of the others?&quot;

Though Ashura was over five years older than Leena, it was clear that 
Leena was the one with more emotional stability between the two of them. 
And the lieutenant was obviously a lot more sure of herself. &quot;It&#39;s too 
late to have doubts now, Ashura. Freeman Ronove has already left for 
Green Cloud and my sister will attack the Sky Cord during that time. 
Things are already in place.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Replied the older woman, &quot;...I&#39;m talking 
about the Elymus Drive. You are aware what it&#39;s capable of when linked 
to Meta Suits, don&#39;t you? The Triad of the Inquisition are really 
planning on using it.&quot;

Leena closed her eyes, and pressed her forehead against Ashura&#39;s. &quot;...My 
love. It&#39;s too late for regrets and doubts now. I know that this is a 
harsh choice in action, but...&quot;

&quot;Harsh? That&#39;s hardly the word for-&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Leena affirmed, &quot;but there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. 
Defying them like Celaph did will just make things worse. It&#39;s a 
difficult trade off, I understand that. But to back away from this... 
would put both you and I in danger. And I can&#39;t have that for you. Just 
try to think about it from the perspective of the earth. We are on the 
dawn of a new world. One where you and I can be together. One moment of 
tragedy will be eased with an eternity of happiness to follow it, right? 
Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself, Ashura.&quot;

Princess Ashura tried to smile. &quot;I know. I know that you are right. But 
I just can&#39;t stop thinking about it...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m here for you. No matter what. Just lean on me. Once the 
Anti-Jupiter Wave defences go up around the Temple, we&#39;ll have all the 
time we need to ourselves. Just focus on that for now. Okay?&quot;

Though this all still bothered her, Ashura nodded in acceptance of that. 
&quot;...Okay.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Sophia sighed peacefully as she leaned on the naked arm of her older 
lover, Cecelia Faye Beatrix. The two of them clung to each other, naked 
in the white sheets of the colonel&#39;s bed. They didn&#39;t often get the 
chance to make love on the Leviathan, but when the opportunity struck, 
they didn&#39;t reject it either. Sophia nuzzled her head into Beatrix&#39;s 
shoulder and ran her hand up and down side of her lover. She listened to 
her breathing and admired the slow rising and falling of Beatrix&#39;s chest 
when she did so. Everything about Cecelia captivated Sophia. Everything. 
Beatrix nudged her head back, wiping the sweat from her bangs which 
darkened them. 

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; She asked, &quot;It&#39;s been hard for you recently.&quot;

Sophia grinned, relishing this closeness. &quot;It&#39;s okay. I don&#39;t mind. We 
needed to get to the village. If the people aren&#39;t informed then they 
could get worried by what may happen here. Even if it meant leaving you 
for a while... I had to go with Terry and Yumi.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you came back,&quot; Said Beatrix, &quot;I miss just... being able to 
make love to you when I want. We don&#39;t get the same kind of privacy here 
as we do on EDEN. And I just feel as though...&quot;

The Mariette-girl smiled. &quot;I know. You don&#39;t have to say anything. 
Plus... I don&#39;t often get the chance to show this off in front of 
everyone.&quot;

Both Sophia and Beatrix looked to the Major&#39;s left hand, more 
specifically the wedding ring finger. Around it was a golden ring band, 
topped off with a seven and a half carat diamond. It shone in the 
moonlight that seeped in through the porthole-like window of Beatrix&#39;s 
room. It was Sophia engagement ring. 

&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful, sweetie,&quot; Sophia said with love, &quot;...I can&#39;t believe 
that you and I will be married someday. It&#39;s almost more than I ever 
hoped for.&quot;

It filled Beatrix with pride to hear that. She knew that she loved 
Sophia more than anything. Her role as commander of Chrysalis and the 
captain of the Leviathan was the most important role in her life up 
until now. When she and Sophia had fallen in love, this changed 
drastically. Now Beatrix&#39;s true heart&#39;s role was to be Sophia&#39;s 
protector. To be the one that cared for her more than anyone else. That 
engagement ring was the symbol of that desire, as well as the bond that 
the two of them would share from now on in. Beatrix and Sophia smiled to 
one and other as they clung together. Then leaned in to each other and 
kissed, Beatrix&#39;s moans muffling Sophia&#39;s giddy giggles. They would have 
resumed their lovemaking from then, if not for the sudden flash of red 
on Beatrix&#39;s left bedside table. 

The colonel broke her kiss with Sophia, growling, then turned to the 
first of her bedside tables. On it was her wrist watch, which acted as a 
transmitter for urgent messages from the bridge. With it she could 
communicate with the people on the bridge of the Leviathan from a three 
miles radius. The green-haired soldier grabbed the wrist watch from the 
table, while Sophia sighed and reached for her glasses on Beatrix&#39;s 
other side table. An annoyed Beatrix pressed a button on the watch which 
opened communications with the bridge of the ship. &quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Forgive me, ma&#39;am!&quot; Said one of the helmswomen through the 
mini-speakers of the wrist watch, &quot;But this is urgent!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s the trouble, then?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Green Cloud! The village is under attack!&quot;

Sophia blinked under her newly mounted glasses. &quot;...What?&quot;

Far from the sex-induced room of Cecelia Faye Beatrix, and a good 
distance from the Leviathan itself was the village of Green Cloud. But 
the peaceful locale was not so peaceful anymore. The people who were 
living there were now gripped in terror. The western half of the village 
had been destroyed. The frail oak wooden homes of the villagers had been 
burned down to the ground. Some had been obliterated entirely. All the 
fragments of the wooden planks that made those houses up were tossed far 
across the space of the village. Fires spread from the ruins of those 
homes. Black clouds of smoke rose up from those fires to choke those who 
were fortunate enough to be able to flee. Dead bodies littered the 
streets of the town. Pools of blood surrounded their broken, slaughtered 
torsos. The stink of their blood mingling with the smell of the smoke 
and of burning wood. The chill wind that was in the air had now vanished 
for the murky heat of the flames. And the villagers scrambled in their 
dozens to get away from the destruction. However the frightening thing 
about all of this was that it originated from a single source. 

The Raum.

The counterpart Meta Suit to the Oriax. The mecha that was designed 
along with the Oriax by the head scientists of the legendary Ochiai 
Underground Research Facility, underneath the precinct of the Shinrai 
Complex. In terms, of looks, the two suits were almost identical aside 
from a few differences. The armour of the Raum was painted a very keen 
black, with traces of gold running along the edges of those plates of 
armour. The exhaust billowing out from its twin thrusters was coloured a 
translucent green rather than a transparent blue. And its cockpit was 
different to that of the Oriax. The alternate dimension that comprised 
the cockpit was encased in a sphere of flame (as opposed to the sphere 
of water that enswathed the cockpit of the Oriax).  Inside that cockpit 
was the owner and pilot of the Raum, Freeman Ronove. 

Freeman smirked with his hands around the control sticks of the panel. 
&quot;Heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh, heh. You poor lambs of tainted breed. Let 
yourself be purified in the flames of God&#39;s anger. Submit yourselves to 
the blade of the Divine One!&quot;

The Raum flew over the small American village and continued its 
onslaught regardless of the consequences. It opened its palm and a 
metal-covered compartment slowly separated. The one-barrel Gatling Gun 
inside that palm extended from it. The Raum then offloaded a huge 
barrage of bullets towards the village as the suit zoomed over it from 
above. The screams of the women and children were deafening as those 
bullets came raining down on anyone in their range. Scores of people 
were gunned down ruthlessly by that gunfire, killing them instantly. The 
Raum retracted its Gatling Gun and pulled up its other arm. A 360 cm 
long blade of flaming green Qi-energy, the Gauntlet Blade, extended from 
the hand of the suit. It flew downwards and then slashed at one of the 
taller buildings of the village. The energy blade hacked through the 
brick and wood of that building, causing it to crumble into itself. 
Crushing to death anyone who happened to remain inside the confides of 
that structure. 

&quot;Die!&quot; Freeman yelled eagerly, &quot;Die! Die! Die! All of you shall die! 
Allow yourselves to be baptized by my holy fist! The Cup of God&#39;s Wrath 
is upon you, ye who art the vile heathens of impurity!&quot; 

While the Raum continued its rampage, everyone on the other side of the 
village tried their best to flee. They packed what little items they 
could spare and scrambled for the shelters of the eastern section. One 
of the houses on the eastern section was that of the Saffron Family. 
Yumi, Terry, Edwina, Kurt, Rain and Bella ran out of the house to see 
what the commotion was. They could see the rising flames and pillars of 
smoke in the distance. As well as the Meta Suit that had brought all 
this about. The dark presence of the Raum. 

Bella was the one most shocked. &quot;My God... who could... do such a 
thing...?&quot;

&quot;...What the hell?&quot; Terry blinked, &quot;what suit is that? I&#39;ve never seen 
it before. But it looks just like the Oriax. Who&#39;s piloting it?&quot;

Yumi&#39;s eyes narrowed with understanding. &quot;...I know.&quot;

&quot;You know what?&quot; Kurt asked. 

&quot;I know who it is... that&#39;s piloting that suit.&quot; She answered. 

Terry turned to her. &quot;You do? Who is it?&quot;

&quot;The one who... raped me in Ix Nos Babel. The one that Protocol regards 
as this generation&#39;s &#39;Thanatos&#39;. His name is Freeman Ronove. That suit 
he is in is called the Raum. It&#39;s... just as powerful as the Oriax.&quot;

Terry&#39;s face paled. &quot;...You mean... he was the one who... did that to 
you...?&quot;

Yumi just nodded in reply. The expression on the American-European boy 
then altered itself from stunned silent to furious. He gripped his hands 
into fists angrily and scowled violently at the distant Raum. &quot;I&#39;ll kill 
that guy! I swear I&#39;ll kill him! I gotta get back to the Leviathan! 
Damn, if only my Bishamon was with me now...!&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t fight him,&quot; Yumi stated, &quot;he&#39;s beyond you now. Only I can 
stop him.&quot;

Kurt swept his hand to one side. &quot;Forget those details for now! We must 
help the other villagers get to safety! If we don&#39;t then the people of 
Green Cloud are doomed!&quot;

Though no one other than Edwina noticed it, Rain tightened up inside. 
And his gaze turned to the Syoga, which was standing just a short ways 
behind the garden of the Saffron household. He would have to pilot it to 
get Freeman and the Raum away from Green Cloud, even if he stood little 
chance against it. But he would never get that chance. Suddenly the head 
of the Raum swung around and gazed in the direction of the Syoga. It 
lifted it black metallic arm and aimed its hand at the old model suit. 
The Gatling Gun compartment in the hand of the mobile machine opened. 
Then it fired a chain wave of bullets. At such a frequent rate that they 
moved in the form of a blur. Hundreds of bullets started nailing the 
Syoga over and over and over again. The frail armour of that old suit 
couldn&#39;t stand up to the vicious power of the Raum. And soon enough, 
Rain&#39;s Meta Suit exploded. Yumi, Terry and the others all jumped to the 
ground for cover at the subsequent explosion of the suit. A wave of 
flame, smoke and dust blew outwardly from the point of combustion, 
eliciting the screams of both Edwina and Bella. The windows of the 
Saffron house all shattered in unison from the force of the explosion, 
and the oil started splattering all over the house&#39;s roof. Once the 
impact from the destruction was over, all that could be seen were the 
charred black scraps of the suit, lying in smoking piles of grey metal. 
The group all gasped at the result, but were even more shocked when a 
gigantic shadow was cast upon them. The Raum Meta Suit flew up to their 
area and hovered in the air with its hand extended to fire more bullets. 
That hand was pointed at Yumi&#39;s group. 

Freeman yelled out at them from the speakers of his suit. &quot;...I knew 
that you would be here, my dearest Eros. You and I are connected by 
fate. It is destiny that brings us together again...&quot;

Terry scowled with a grown, lifting himself up from the dusty ground. 
&quot;...Is this that bastard who abused you, Yumi?&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot;

Kurt quickly stepped closer to his wife and daughter protectively and 
yelled up at the gigantic Meta Suit looming over them.  &quot;Please, stop 
this nonsense! The people of the village want only a peaceful life! If 
you must fight then do so elsewhere!&quot;

&quot;You dare to give me orders, old man?&quot; Freeman remarked, &quot;Do you know 
who or what I am? I am Freeman Ronove. I am the Thanatos of this era. I 
am a shepherd, not a member of the flock. My fate is decided by God and 
I submit only to his will. You are nothing. Therefore your opinion means 
nothing. None of you are of any importance.&quot;

Yumi then called out to him. &quot;Freeman! It is me you want, is it not? 
Leave these people out of it! If you want to kill me then kill me and me 
alone!&quot;

&quot;Eros... as usual your concern is for the people who don&#39;t deserve it. 
Forget not your station. You and I are the future of mankind, you see. 
Though we failed to produce a Novus Deus... our symbiosis with the Heart 
of the Astaroth proves that our time is not yet over. No matter what 
that doctor said... you and I are equally significant. So only one of us 
may proceed into the next phase.&quot;

The Japanese girl spread her arms out. &quot;Fine then! Kill me!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Freeman said with a smile, &quot;killing you while you are defenceless 
is pathetic. I want to decide our fate on an equal playing field. Come 
to me with in the Oriax. Then we shall settle our differences in the 
field of combat.&quot;

&quot;On a cold day in hell!&quot; Terry shouted, &quot;if you wanna fight someone then 
fight me!&quot;

Freeman chuckled at the blonde man. &quot;Stupid human. I care not for your 
rage. I will waste none of my time on a wretched piece of trash like 
you.&quot;

The anger in Terry&#39;s eyes was unmistakable, but he looked away from the 
Raum and then back to Kurt and his family, who were huddled together 
behind him. &quot;You guys have got to get out of here! Go east until you see 
a battleship in the sky! That&#39;s our ship, the Leviathan! They&#39;ll take 
care of you!&quot;

Kurt nodded, then proceeded to run with Bella. However Edwina didn&#39;t 
move. She stayed in place, staring wordlessly at the quiet and confused 
Rain. She couldn&#39;t leave him. She just couldn&#39;t. Kurt turned around when 
he realized that his daughter wasn&#39;t following him. &quot;Edwina! Come on!&quot;

&quot;...But...&quot;

Rain stepped around, looking deeply into his friend&#39;s eyes. He wanted 
nothing more than her safety in all of this.  So he nodded to her. To 
tell her that she should go and to assure her that he would try to make 
it out of all of this alive. And though Edwina was still hesitant, she 
backed up and then ran away with her parents. The three of them made the 
dash down the road towards the edge of the town. Further along was the 
hills that surrounded Green Cloud, the Leviathan was nestled between 
them. And that would be their destination. 

Yumi then yelled up at the Raum. &quot;Freeman! Leave this place now! I will 
fight you as you wish! But not here and not now! I won&#39;t fight you under 
these conditions!&quot;

Freeman smirked again. &quot;Oh, I think you will. Behold the will of God...&quot;

The Raum started to move once again. The palm Gatling that was aimed at 
Yumi&#39;s group now moved over to the east. The crosshairs on the video 
screen of the Raum&#39;s cockpit then locked on to Kurt, Edwina and Bella. 
Yumi and Terry gasped at what he was about to do, and Rain yelled 
&#39;stop!&#39; as loudly as his feminine voice possibly could. But Freeman was 
in no position to be stopped now. He pulled the trigger on the right 
control stick and his Meta Suit offloaded another hail of bullets. Time 
then slowed down for Rain Harland as those bullets proceeded to rain 
down on the fleeing Saffron Family. Their bodies all jerked violently, 
spewing up globs of blood from their mouths and torsos. Each bullet of 
the 372 fired at them made their mark. Blood splattered all over the 
floor and mingled with the scent of smoke. The three dead bodies of 
Edwina, Kurt and Bella then dropped to the ground lifelessly, their eyes 
still wide open, glassy with the suddenness of their deaths. 

Rain&#39;s heart fell. &quot;Edwina!&quot;

&quot;...Damn you,&quot; Terry seethed, looking up at the Raum, &quot;Goddamn you!&quot;

Freeman just laughed. &quot;Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What did you expect? To 
the Eros and I, you people are nothing more than ants. Just livestock to 
be shunted across a chess board for amusement and pleasure. That is the 
fate of all those who carry the filthy and contaminated blood of a 
sinning race. My breath is the divine judgement. And I simply pander to 
the will and word of God.&quot;

Yumi and Terry looked on with disbelief at the actions of Freeman. But 
Rain&#39;s mind was set only on what had happened to the Saffron Family. 
Most importantly of all, Edwina. That burning sensation he suffered 
inside of the Syoga came back. But at a far higher degree than normal. 
He screamed loudly, catching the attention of the two beside him, and 
then collapsed to the ground. His knees were grazed against the rough 
stone of the floor. And he held himself furiously, struggling to contain 
the fiery force that was burning in his body and blood. His breathing 
became erratic. Then suddenly it happened. His Qi-Force exploded to 
life. The colour in Rain&#39;s eyes went completely blank and the savage 
flames of his Qi swallowed him completely. Yumi, Terry and even Freeman 
watched this with perplexity.  Rain&#39;s body was wholly absorbed into a 
spherical manifestation of his own Qi, which hovered in the space above 
the ground. Yumi and Freeman both took note. Because it had happened to 
them both as well. But only Freeman knew the significance of it.

Freeman stared at the Qi sphere from the video screen of his cockpit. 
&quot;...Divine Hibernation? Impossible. How could a lowly human like THAT 
ever achieve...&quot; And then it hit him, &quot;...he must be an Ashtar... is 
this the truth behind this whole thing...?&quot;

Then suddenly there was a gigantic bang. A loud and authoritative blast 
of energy came screaming from the east in the direction of the Raum. The 
Meta Suit quickly surrounded itself in a large Qi-Barrier. And that 
large blast of energy rammed into the shield violently. The light from 
the collision of the two forces flashed around the immediate area. Yumi 
and Terry huddled together and covered their ears to stop themselves 
from being deafened by the sonic waves of power that emanated from the 
blast point. The Raum stood its ground but was forced back by the 
strength of the beam blast. Terry looked to the east of the village and 
knew what this was. A blast from the Gamma Cannon of the Leviathan. Then 
the wrist strap on his wrist began to flash. Terry pulled up his arm and 
pressed a button on it.

Beatrix&#39;s voice came up from the mini-speaker. &quot;Lieutenant Hennig! 
Lieutenant Mishima! You must make your escape now, while we provide 
cover with the Leviathan&#39;s Gamma Cannon! Get out of there!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to tell me twice! Let&#39;s go, Yumi!&quot;

Yumi nodded and the two of them ran in the direction of the ship. They 
ran past the splattered corpses of the Saffron Family, though Yumi 
couldn&#39;t help but look back at the swirling mass of Qi that Rain was 
trapped in. She could do nothing to help him while he was inside it, but 
she knew that he was safe inside it. And the startled Freeman could only 
watch while Yumi and Terry escaped his presence. Though he was still 
consumed mostly with Yumi Mishima, the Eros, his mind could not stray 
from the Qi sphere below. 

Freeman mused, staring at the image of the Qi ball while his shields 
held off the Leviathan&#39;s Gamma Cannon blast. &quot;...An Ashtar... but 
why...?&quot;
