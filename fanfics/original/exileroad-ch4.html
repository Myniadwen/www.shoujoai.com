<a href="../original/exileroad-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        &quot;I think it&#39;s a bad business to be getting
yourself involved with,&quot; Garrison said with a frown,
his short gray hair almost silver in the bar&#39;s
firelight. His heavy muscles tensed slightly as he
poured another customer a mug of the bitter local beer
all the while keeping a wary eye on where the Duchess
Jantha and Laur&#39;ien sat waiting.

        &quot;I&#39;m surprised to hear you saying that,&quot;
Midori replied, tall black haired woman smiling
slightly from where she was casually leaning against
the bar, &quot;considering that you were the one who was so
sure she wanted to bed me.&quot;

        &quot;A friendly roll between the sheets is one
thing,&quot; Garrison said to her dryly, &quot;body-guarding one
like her is another.&quot;

        &quot;Gave my word,&quot; Midori shrugged casually, &quot;I&#39;m
committed now.&quot;

        There was a soft snort of laughter from the
redheaded young man who was sitting nearby, listening
in to the conversation eagerly. &quot;It&#39;ll make a lovely
verse for The Ballad of Magnificent Midori,&quot; Nathaniel
offered cheerfully.

        The look that Midori gave the bard was deadly
as she growled out, &quot;Haven&#39;t you given that fool idea
up yet, Nat&#39;anel?&quot;

        Nathaniel just grinned back, clearly sure that
the traditional bardic immunity would protect him.
&quot;Ah, it&#39;s going lovely,&quot; he laughed, &quot;I just need to
find some romance for you.&quot;

        Garrison snickered at the irritable look on
Midori&#39;s face, wiping up a nearby spill as he moved
smoothly. &quot;Just give in,&quot; he advised her, &quot;it&#39;s
easier.&quot;

        Midori shook her head as she pushed away from
the bar. &quot;I&#39;d best get my things, the Duchess is
looking impatient,&quot; she said before heading up the
stairs.

        Over at their table the Duchess Jantha watched
with concealed interest as Midori left, the lovely
blonde gracefully sipping at a glass of wine. &quot;So how
do you know her?&quot; Laur&#39;ien asked curiously, the tawny
brown haired officer looking at her with those bright
brown eyes.

        Jantha took another sip as she coldly
answered, &quot;It is none of your concern.&quot;

        Still smiling Laur&#39;ien shook her head,
&quot;M&#39;lady, we&#39;re all going to be stuck with each other
for a while, at least until we find out who&#39;s trying
to kill you. Taking that stance won&#39;t help.&quot;

        Jantha opened her mouth to shoot back some
comment but restrained herself. Finally she conceded,
&quot;A good point, officer.&quot; She took a steadying breath,
&quot;I stopped in here by chance a few weeks ago and found
I liked the place.&quot;

        &quot;And the company?&quot; with a impish little smile
Laur&#39;ien nodded towards the stairway that Midori had
disappeared up.

        &quot;You&#39;re bold,&quot; Jantha blushed faintly.

        Laur&#39;ien shrugged, taking a drink from her mug
of beer. &quot;Always have been,&quot; she agreed, choosing not
to push the noble lady any farther.

        Midori descended only a few moments later,
carrying the sort of simple bag that an army officer
might have used. She also had the heavy battle staff
slung over her shoulders and a short sword was belted
at her side. Midori walked over to the table and
smiled slightly as she said, &quot;Well, you two look like
you&#39;re getting along.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re managing,&quot; Jantha said with a great
deal of dignity.

        Laur&#39;ien smirked as she looked up at Midori to
ask, &quot;So what were you and your friends talking about,
if I may ask?&quot;

        &quot;How mad I must be for going along with this,&quot;
Midori said dryly, ignoring Laur&#39;ien&#39;s chuckle. She
shifted her bag on her shoulder, &quot;Well, where to now?&quot;

        Jantha smoothly rose from her seat, her long
blue dress flowing around her long legs. &quot;We&#39;d best go
to my family home to start with,&quot; she said
thoughtfully, &quot;you&#39;ll need rooms.&quot;

        Laur&#39;ien got up, the rangy young woman
stretching slightly. &quot;You could always install her in
your bedroom,&quot; she offered casually.

        &quot;No,&quot; Midori said shortly.

        Jantha blinked, the oddest look appearing on
her beautiful face. It was clear that she was a bit
surprised by the bluntness of Midori&#39;s statement but
she still she managed to say to Laur&#39;ien, &quot;Besides
which, it wouldn&#39;t be proper to do so.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Laur&#39;ien looked casual as
they moved into the crowds outside the bar, &quot;I&#39;ve
always wondered about some of those lady&#39;s maids I&#39;ve
seen,&quot;

        Jantha gave the young military officer a
disapproving look as she coldly said, &quot;Such things
aren&#39;t spoken of in polite company.&quot;

        Laur&#39;ien just smiled saucily as she drawled,
&quot;I&#39;m not polite company and I rather doubt that Midori
is, either.&quot;

        &quot;Would you two please behave?&quot; Midori loudly
grumbled. She dropped her voice slightly, &quot;Did you see
our shadows, yet?&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Laur&#39;ien answered her promptly,
&quot;one of them is holding a distance behind us while
another is keeping just ahead of us.&quot;

        &quot;You two are playing games with me, I hope,&quot;
Jantha&#39;s face had gone mildly pale, looking around
them cautiously.

        &quot;I don&#39;t play games,&quot; Midori answered, moving
just slightly to loosen her sword in her hilt. &quot;Good
eyes,&quot; she complimented Laur&#39;ien softly.

        &quot;Nose, actually,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said, tapping her
thin nose with a single finger. &quot;One of the few gifts
that carries over from my other form,&quot; she added.

        &quot;So what do we do about them?&quot; Jantha asked,
noting that Midori still didn&#39;t look too happy about
being reminded about Laur&#39;ien being a shapeshifter.

        &quot;Should we wait for them to move in or try to
force their hands?&quot; Laur&#39;ien asked casually, her eyes
shining with restrained eagerness.

        Midori quietly asked them, &quot;You up to a run?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Jantha answered bravely.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Midori flashed Jantha a grin.

        Midori and Laur&#39;ien exchanged a silent glance
then the little group bolted, Laur&#39;ien dropping behind
a bit to guard their rear while Midori took the point.
They forced through the mob quickly, then the first
attacker moved in to try and block their way, the
weasily looking man holding a wicked looking dirk in
his hand. He looked light street trash on the surface
but his stance and the look in his eyes showed he knew
how to use a weapon.

        CRACK!

        Without even breaking her stride Midori swung
out with her heavy oaken staff, slamming it down right
onto his collar. It might have been his collar bone
breaking or maybe the shoulder but either way he
dropped to the cobblestones, the three women bounding
right by him.

        &quot;He dead, you think?&quot; Laur&#39;ien shouted.

        &quot;Just stunned,&quot; Midori answered.

        &quot;Pity,&quot; a scowling Jantha muttered.

        Behind them their pursuer struggled to get
free of the crowd, the black clad woman eventually
reaching the open. She raised her crossbow, sighting
on them before jerking as a blade struck home into her
belly. Laur&#39;ien slipped the other slim throwing blades
that she carried away into her jacket even as the
assassin slowly crumpled to the ground.

        &quot;It&#39;s not a lethal wound,&quot; Laur&#39;ien commented,
&quot;as long as she gets medical help soon.&quot;

        The three women only stopped hurrying when
they finally reached the Dutchess&#39; home a few blocks
away. The fine home was older, the stone and brick
made by the best artisans of that era, designed to
stand boldly apart from the common people. Balconies
swung out the upper floors, towers on the top floor
providing a view of the city around them. Both Midori
and Laur&#39;ien were careful to check the exterior of the
place thoroughly before finally going inside with
Jantha.

        &quot;My home is secure,&quot; Jantha protested as she
was escorted inside.

        &quot;We&#39;ve seen that someone wants to kill you,&quot;
Laur&#39;ien said quite seriously, &quot;it seems foolish to
take any unnecessary chances.&quot;

        &quot;Miss, I&#39;m glad your home...&quot; a door swung
open, a pretty maid entering only to see the armed and
clearly dangerous looking Midori and Laur&#39;ien, &quot;eep!&quot;
She fainted dead away, hitting the floor with a soft
thump.

        &quot;Was it something we said?&quot; Laur&#39;ien quipped.

        &quot;Damn,&quot; Midori bent down to check the young
lady over.

        &quot;This is going to work so well,&quot; Jantha
sighed, &quot;I can just tell.&quot;</pre>
