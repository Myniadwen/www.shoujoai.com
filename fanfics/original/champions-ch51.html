The Man in White

Because they had arrived at their destination first, the so-called 
&quot;Ronin Team&quot; set about investigating their temporary abode, to see if 
there were any injured people inside.  Kailin suggested a search for any 
possible missing data, but her idea was shot down for two reasons:  
first, since only Kamaguchi handled that stuff, nobody would know what 
it looked like anyway; and second, now that the Dead Zodiac were gone, 
it would be pointless to look anyway.  Any tricks the three women 
might&#39;ve used on them would be worthless now.  But just to be safe, 
Ferret insisted, and was given the chance to (as only she could) sift 
through the building in her ghost form until she found them.

Luckily, MERCS headquarters had been virtually untouched by the war, and 
what little mischief the Dead Zodiac caused was insignificant.  A few 
stray criminals had wandered inside and sniffed around, but were driven 
away by the skeleton crew Yohko left behind to keep the place intact.  
The few short battles they had seen bore few casualties&#151;but the one that 
really worried everyone was Yui Miyamoto&#39;s condition.  She had been shot 
while trying to save a coworker, and another criminal stabbed her 
critically during a fight.  She had been kept stable through a few 
medical devices Yohko kept stored around&#151;the woman was a doctor, after 
all&#151;but now, several hours after the fights, she didn&#39;t look well.

&quot;This is a fatal wound,&quot; Kathy murmured, using her eyes to scan the 
reddish-black spots that had matted over Yui&#39;s body.  Miyamoto herself 
was breathing calmly, still a lot of fight left in her, but she had no 
illusions about her life being prolonged.  She breathlessly asked to see 
Yohko; Rin set off as fast as she could, with Kathy beside her; they 
wanted to see if Marissa, Mora, or Aura could help turn the tide.  While 
they were away, the others tended to Yui as best they could, but every 
minute lessened her chances of survival.

Kamaguchi came back with a convoy&#151;others who had heard the distress call 
and came running&#151;and was the first at Yui&#39;s side.  She clutched her best 
friend&#39;s hand tightly, as if by letting go she would surrender her to 
the void, and whispered to her in private.  As the doctor tended to her 
friend&#39;s injuries, the others slowly came trickling in, many of them 
still wounded and weary from the war.  They shot the untrustworthy 
doctor venomous gazes when she averted nearly all her resources to the 
task of saving Yui&#39;s life, but then again, they didn&#39;t expect any less 
from the bigoted woman.  She had no true love for heroes, it seemed.

When she came out of Yui&#39;s room, her face was grim and ragged.  Yui had 
been her closest friend for ages, the one person she trusted even more 
than Pandora&#151;the one person she would honestly give her life for.  
However, there was a building full of exhausted heroes there, each of 
them forced to wait for treatment so that Yui would have another hour 
left.  It was safe to say that their opinion of the doctor lessened 
significantly that day, but seeing as how they didn&#39;t expect her to 
treat them all that well, they really couldn&#39;t complain.

&quot;Curse this technology,&quot; she muttered to herself, gazing over the crowd.  
&quot;For all our work in science and medicine, we still have so far to go.  
What&#39;s the use of it when we can&#39;t even save one little life?  But there 
might be a chance&#151;I just hope she listens.&quot;  Yohko descended down the 
staircase to the first floor, and wove her way around the crowd until 
she came to Amielle and Alicia&#39;s corner, where the shadow-warrior was 
nursing a cut leg.  Needless to say, the Stalker bristled.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Just to talk,&quot; Yohko said, holding her hands up defensively.  &quot;Am I 
correct to say that you are the alter ego of Pale the Angel, Miss 
Moore?&quot;  Alicia nodded slowly.  It was no secret that the doctor 
knew&#151;everyone did.  &quot;Can you, then, call upon Pale&#39;s presence at your 
will?&quot;

&quot;No, I can&#39;t.  I have no control over her.  She comes and goes as she 
pleases.&quot;  Yohko chewed on her lip.  There was still hope...

&quot;Would you take the elevator with me?  I have a favor to ask of you.&quot;  
Alicia&#39;s face darkened; she already knew what Kamaguchi wanted.

&quot;You need Pale&#39;s powers to bring Yui back.&quot;  Yohko nodded.

&quot;That&#39;s right.  Technology cannot repair these wounds, and those who 
might help are already taxed.  I know I have no right to ask you 
anything...&quot;

&quot;Spare me the humility, doctor,&quot; said Alicia, quiet and bitter.  &quot;I may 
be young and handicapped, but I can still see through your schemes.  And 
the eyes of Pale see through far more.  They know what you have in 
store.&quot;

&quot;I only want to save my best friend,&quot; Yohko pleaded, her voice tight 
with emotion.  Alicia sighed wearily.  The doctor was telling the truth, 
and for once, she didn&#39;t have any ulterior motive.  Glancing at Amielle 
for support, Alicia squeezed the older girl&#39;s hand before wheeling off.

&quot;If Pale does not wish to help you, there&#39;s nothing I can do.  I will 
make no further guarantees.&quot;

&quot;Thank you...&quot;  Yohko smiled joyfully and helped guide Alicia to the 
upper floors, where Yui laid in stasis.  When they got to the room, 
Alicia asked to be alone, and her wish was granted.  She wheeled inside, 
looked at the bloodied woman in pity, and took her hand.

&quot;Another life on the edge of death,&quot; she murmured, her voice deep with 
thought.  &quot;Pale managed to save my life, long ago.  I wonder if she will 
do the same.  Pale, my soul and my self, if you can hear me, I ask you 
to exercise your judgment on this woman&#39;s life.  I am powerless to help 
her.  If it is your will...&quot;

Even though she was wounded, Yui Miyamoto was strong enough to wince as 
a brilliant wave of light cloaked the room...

......

Yohko shifted nervously, hoping against all the logic in her mind that 
Pale would come through for her.  Buried deep inside her jaded heart was 
a pulsating muscle of hope and love, love for her closest and dearest 
friend that enabled her to shove aside her hate and mistrust, and 
believe once again in the general goodness of all creatures.  She knew 
she didn&#39;t deserve any special treatment, but this was Yui.  If anyone 
deserved to live, even if only for a moment longer, it was she.  Her 
hopes rose, perhaps in futility, when the door opened and footsteps 
padded through.  No mistaking it&#151;this was Pale.

&quot;She is safe,&quot; spoke the angel, her ashen face bittersweet as ever.  
&quot;The two of you were lucky that I was called so soon.  Given another 
hour, and not even medical science would&#39;ve kept her from passing&#151;and I 
am not in the habit of constantly raising the dead.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot; gushed Yohko, kneeling down and clasping Pale&#39;s cold 
hands.  &quot;Thank you, thank you&#151;from the bottom of my heart, I thank you!&quot;  
Pale politely pulled away, and looked Yohko right in her eyes, chilling 
the doctor to the bone.

&quot;Know this, woman.  I know what you have planned.  My eyes see what goes 
on in here, even the things that Kathryn O&#39;Hare cannot.  I saved Yui for 
a reason.  You still have time to stop your scheming.  If you do 
not...then you will surely die.&quot;

&quot;I honestly have no idea what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; whispered Yohko 
breathlessly.  &quot;You must be mistaken&#151;surely you must.&quot;

&quot;No.  I am not.&quot;  In the far distance, a slight rumbling sound could be 
heard, and the world seemed to shudder.  Pale looked up to the ceiling, 
through a small glass pane that let the stars, moon, and sun shine 
through...and became eerily grim.  &quot;Now we must all face the 
consequences of my actions.  You cannot have something for free in this 
world, Yohko Kamaguchi.  Even good actions must be paid for.  You will 
soon have many opportunities to work off your debt.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?  Can you...sense something coming?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; answered Pale, her voice low and haunting.  &quot;He is here.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;...Him.&quot;

......

No matter if they were injured or not, everyone rushed outside to see 
what the commotion was.  They found the man in white, glowing with a 
frightening light, hovering high in the air with a livid expression&#151;his 
smile completely forgotten.  &quot;WHERE IS SHE?&quot; he demanded, his voice 
explosive.  &quot;WHERE IS PALE?  I HAVE FELT HER&#151;BRING HER TO ME!!&quot;

&quot;This guy&#39;s absolutely demented,&quot; murmured Haanz.

&quot;Pale&#39;s not here, you bastard!&quot; roared Amielle, brandishing her arms.  
&quot;I told you that already!  Why don&#39;t you go away and leave us alone?&quot;  
Thirteen glowered at her, forcing her to jerk back in sudden fear.  He 
then looked to Shalis and Namie, and became calm.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; he said, his voice smooth again, &quot;you are loyal to me, are you 
not?  Is Pale here?  Tell me.  Now is the time to collect your debt.&quot;  
The team focused on their allies, the two lovers who had transformed 
many times since their introduction.  They exchanged a look, clasped 
hands, and raised their heads to face their master.

&quot;Yes, O Thirteenth One, Pale is here.  She goes by the alternate name of 
Alicia Moore.&quot;

&quot;You slimy bitches!!&quot;  Amielle rushed out and tackled them, wailing 
madly with her bare fists.  Namie put her hand on her comrade&#39;s shoulder 
and briefly activated her acidic powers, burning the cloth and skin just 
enough to distract the enraged woman.  Shalis was now partially freed, 
and pushed Amielle away.  She stood and, with her lover, distanced 
herself from the group, siding with the flying mass of glowing light.

&quot;You traitors,&quot; Amielle growled, bristling like a tigress.  &quot;I can&#39;t 
think of a curse horrible enough to place on you.  Killing you would 
only insult the demons in Hell!  How could you?!&quot;

&quot;You have to understand, Amielle!&quot; shouted Namie.  &quot;Master Thirteen took 
us in and did what no other person has ever done.  He cared for us, and 
loved us!  He nurtured us, and accepted us as normal people!  He brought 
us together, and he healed us of our curses.  He gave us what we wanted 
the most, and for that, we must remain loyal to him.&quot;

&quot;Fuck that!!!&quot; she screamed.  &quot;He&#39;s a lying, manipulative, cheating, 
swindling, creepy, back-stabbing, selfish, evil, wretched, maniacal 
bastard son of a bitch!!  He used us, all of us, just to get what he 
wanted!!  And what did we get in return?!&quot;

&quot;I got my humanity back,&quot; Shalis answered, her voice strong.  &quot;And Namie 
now knows what it is like to touch another person, and to feel love.  
These are things that we were willing to give anything for.  Didn&#39;t all 
of us have something we wanted, something worth all this trouble?&quot;  
Amielle was now weeping, but from anger and frustration, not sadness.

&quot;You cold-hearted monster...  You&#39;re more a machine now than when you 
were before.  Don&#39;t you get it?  He was hunting Pale!  He wanted to 
prosecute her for what she did, and condemn her to Hell for eternity.  
And you say you have things you&#39;d rather want?  What kind of a horrible 
person are you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Shalis, clinging to her lover, &quot;but we&#39;ve made our 
choice.&quot;  Amielle cast her face down, and crumbled to the floor, 
weeping.  All her hard work, all that skulking around and hiding...all 
of those wonderful, ethereal hours spent with her soulmate&#151;all for 
nothing!  First her parents, and now her lover.  When would it ever end?

&quot;Look,&quot; said Merry stiffly, &quot;I don&#39;t condone what you&#39;ve done either, 
but it&#39;s become clear to me that we can&#39;t just hand Pale over to that 
freak up there.  She&#39;s our friend now, and there&#39;s no crime big enough 
to convince us to hand her over.  I&#39;ll fight for her, and Amielle, even 
if I have to give up my own wonderful life to do it!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m in on this as well,&quot; added Marissa.  &quot;Having died once before, I no 
longer fear an endless eternity spent in the void of Chaos.  I know 
where I will go, and I know who I truly am.  I am loved now; all of this 
is good enough.  I will fight, even if I must die ten times before I 
win!&quot;

&quot;I help friends!&quot; called Julie, rallying along with the other girls.  
&quot;But not hate Namie or Shalis.  Wish not to fight them.  Love-love them!  
I help protect Pale, because she my friend too.  I...am not...a monster.  
I am not a monster!  I&#39;m not a monster!  I&#39;m a human being!&quot;

&quot;Guess that leaves me,&quot; sighed Alisti, crossing her arms.  She looked 
over and smiled wanly at Skye.  &quot;I assume that your everlasting love of 
me will convince you to come along as well?&quot;  The silent young woman 
grinned and gave Alisti a wink.  One by one, more and more people 
rallied behind Amielle, against two who were once their comrades&#151;and one 
that nobody ever really liked or trusted.  Thirteen regarded the 
assembly with an indifferent smile; Namie and Shalis just held each 
other tightly.

And then, the star of the show appeared.

&quot;I will not hide, Metatron!&quot; proclaimed the loud voice of Pale, the 
Fallen Angel, and the focal point of this whole debacle.  She hovered 
over the heads of her allies and friends, landed next to Amielle, and 
looked straight up at him.  &quot;I am here, at last, no longer in the 
shadows.  There is no point to it anyway.  If you must do this, then get 
it over with.  However, realize that I have no intention of going along 
quietly.  I will fight you, even if I stand no chance.&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re going to win,&quot; whispered Amielle, taking her lover&#39;s hand and 
smiling warmly.  Pale returned the gesture and mouthed a thanks.  
Thirteen&#39;s smile broadened.

&quot;You are all interfering with powers that are beyond your limits.  I 
will say this once:  surrender Pale, immediately.  I will give you 
whatever you ask; all you have to do is name it.  Riches, power, 
companionship, the return of a lost loved one&#151;all these things and more 
are within my grasp, if you will just give me what I seek.&quot;

&quot;So basically, we&#39;re selling our souls for material goods,&quot; growled 
Stevenson.  He balled his fists up and stood strong, his comrades 
surrounding him.  &quot;Not a chance, you white freak!  I&#39;d rather die doing 
the right thing than live in that kind of shame!  Show us your worst!&quot;

&quot;I can do a lot more than that,&quot; sang the man in white.  His glow 
broadened, his arms spread...

&quot;No,&quot; said Pale and Amielle, their voices as one&#151;&quot;We will do this, 
together.&quot;  They squeezed their hands tight, and from out of their free 
palms emerged a radiant sword&#151;one black, one white.  Their bodies 
suddenly burst in an explosion of black and white light, and the two 
seemed fused at their hands:  an almighty symbol of yin and yang, 
balance and chaos, all overpowered by love.  Even Thirteen jerked back 
slightly in surprise as the two glowing women came at him, spinning 
viciously, their swords sailing through the air, direct at his body.  
The force was like a hurricane, slashing through his defenses greedily, 
throwing the glowing man back with a terrible shove.

Thirteen crashed into the ground, letting a shriek of surprise&#151;and 
pain&#151;out as his body fell into the ground, the impact so great that a 
small hill erupted from the residue.  Amielle and Pale stood waiting, 
examining their handiwork, patiently biding their time as the dust 
cleared and their own pulses subsided.  They let their hands go, held 
their breath...

&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; whispered Alisti in shock.  &quot;Did they really do it...?&quot;  
Skye shook her head; the team dared to step forward, into the unknown.  
For the longest time, nothing happened.  A few people began to believe 
they had really done it, that the frightening, eerie, godlike man in 
white had been defeated.  But a power that great cannot be extinguished 
so easily, and as the earth blew apart, gravel and stone flying out in 
an explosion, the power they thought defeated returned&#151;only now, in its 
true form, and ten times stronger.

There was no mistaking it:  the man in white had been, in fact, an angel 
all this time.  His body was now thrice the size it once was, and 
blinding fire shot out from his body, consuming the air.  The creature&#39;s 
feet were gold, its arms blazing and silvery, its head like a 
thunderstorm.  It was covered with all-seeing eyes, a great many color 
of them, and wings, countless wings, looking more like water and clouds 
than feathers or membrane.  In his hand was an all-consuming rod, its 
tip blazing with the volcanic fury of Heaven.  This was no meek, 
feminine comforter, nor adorable cherubim, not even an avenging savior.  
This was a living, breathing, thinking Star, clothed like the sun, its 
voice a roll of thunder, its vengeance swift.

With but a gesture, it swept Amielle and Pale aside; the others sprang 
into action, futile though it was.  Alisti tried blasting him, but the 
force merely sent the angel tumbling backwards, nothing more.  No melee 
fighter could get close to him because of the searing flames, each 
white-hot tongue a lash of solar fury, and all missiles either burned or 
melted upon contact.  Thirteen roared and slammed his rod on the ground, 
jostling the heroes and sending them to their knees.  He floated closer, 
slowly, casting no shadow.

Marissa rolled to the side just as a wall of searing flame carved a 
canyon in the ground.  Using her powers at full force was deadly, 
but...what could she lose?  Yohko would just bring her back, like she 
had before&#151;that&#39;s what &quot;mothers&quot; were for, right?  She amplified her 
powers and sent everything she had at the creature in white, the one who 
had helped her, guided her, fed her and sheltered her&#151;but she felt no 
remorse, no sorrow at all.  She loved another now.  If Thirteen felt her 
blast, he didn&#39;t react; he just swept at the air, sending a gust of wind 
bowling her over, and spewed ice and flames from his mouth, burning the 
evolved woman.

Even Merry could not withstand his heat, so she and a few others focused 
on Shalis and Namie.  It was one thing for the two to betray them like 
that, but now they were actually fighting alongside that damned 
creature, against people who had once been friends.  The battle was both 
tragic and fierce, Namie keeping attackers at bay with her acidic touch 
and Shalis fighting them with limbs enhanced by bionics.  Julie kept out 
of that fight&#151;she couldn&#39;t bear to raise her hand against friends, even 
if they were traitors&#151;and kept to fighting the man in white, though even 
she could not endure getting close to him.  She used her speed and 
flexibility to save others, instead, diving in at the last second to 
catch her troubled friends.

Amielle and Pale fought back ferociously, but except for Pale, nobody 
was doing any kind of damage at all&#151;and the way Pale fought was 
frightening.  Everyone knew what she could do (they recalled the battle 
against The Dragon), and stared in horror as she and the creature in 
white locked horns, slashing each other apart.  They did not bleed, did 
not cry out, did not even stop&#151;they just fought.  Those who were once 
Lost found themselves going up against this creature, the one who had 
offered to help them in exchange for a service...but now that they knew 
the full truth, they chose the path of selflessness.  Nobody could bring 
themselves to betray Pale, not even for their own sake.

But Thirteen was vastly superior to all of them, even Pale.  He wiped 
everyone out with great blasts, flattening them again and again.  It was 
clear that with his power, he could kill easily, yet he chose not to.  
Instead, he disabled them, crushing them under an invisible weight.  He 
only attacked Pale; everyone else he merely defended against, or shoved 
back.  There was no way they could win, no way at all.  Finally, after 
what seemed like eight lifetimes, Thirteen knocked Pale back, grimaced 
with glee, and prepared to annihilate the fallen one.  Amielle stood in 
front of her lover and used all her power to shield her; Marissa joined 
her friend, amplifying her powers, and soon one by one, everyone focused 
just to keep their friend, their comrade and ally, their beloved Pale 
from being destroyed.  Even Pale sat up and fought&#151;not for herself, but 
for those she loved.

The blast dug a deep trench around the heroes, and even with all their 
combined efforts, nearly broke their defenses.  But it held, just 
barely.

&quot;I do not understand,&quot; proclaimed the angel, the Thirteenth One.  &quot;You 
are already defeated.  You knew, just from knowing who I was and what I 
could do, that you could not win.  I gave you everything, and I vowed to 
give you more.  To heal your wounds, to fill your gaps, to replenish 
those you lost, and to return love to your hearts&#151;are these not what 
people truly seek?  I donated everything, and all I asked was your 
cooperation.  This fallen angel means nothing to you.  I could easily 
sustain the woman she keeps alive.  Surely that was not your only 
concern, though&#151;so why?  I must ask you, why?  Why do you continue to 
fight me?  Accept your judgment, my fallen sister!!&quot;

From the ruins of the earth, slowly coming to focus as the dust settled, 
Pale&#39;s voice emerged, weak yet persistent.

&quot;I already have.  Even though I knew I was damned, I still wanted to 
help people.  Don&#39;t you see?  I was cast out from Heaven for questioning 
our Lord, because I felt He was far too inactive.  In the old days, He 
used to interact with His creation so much, but now...I began to 
seriously doubt Him.  How could He so coldly turn His back on the beings 
He once loved and guided?  How could He let Malchior be so abused?  How 
could He let these beautiful Lost Girls go down such a spiraling 
descent?  How could He abide pain, and war, and grief?  How could He 
stand by and watch as two women lost their loved ones to villainy?  Did 
He no longer feel love?

&quot;I abandoned Heaven to do what I felt needed to be done.  I came as an 
emissary of hope and light, to do what He did not, to be Heaven&#39;s 
representative, even if Heaven itself refused me.  And for this, you 
say, I must be judged.  Surely,&quot; she whispered, now visibly crying, &quot;if 
this is what God has turned out to be, then I am glad I have left 
Heaven.  But if our Lord is truly the Lord I remember, the one I love 
and serve, He will not send me to Hell for doing the right thing!  So 
what if I spoke out against Him?!  He needs more of us to question His 
method, no matter how infallible He believes Himself to be!  I have 
surely been led to believe that you are at fault, my shining brother&#151;not 
I.&quot;

The world froze, quiet and serene, as they waited for the shining one to 
answer.

Amielle stood instead.

&quot;I don&#39;t care about any of that,&quot; she said, limping over to her beloved.  
&quot;I just want to be with Pale, or Alicia, or whoever this is.  I want to 
love her and be a part of her, for as long as my body and soul are 
intact.  Even if I have to go up against God Himself, I will NEVER 
surrender my love for her.  Do you hear me, man in white?  I refuse to 
let go of Pale.  I love her more than I could ever love anything, and 
there&#39;s nothing you can do against that.  Go away, and leave us alone.&quot;

He seemed to consider this new development carefully.

&quot;You do realize what you are saying, do you not?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;I may not be the only one who comes here asking to claim this fallen 
star.  There could be others.  What will you say to them?  Will you 
continue this defiance, even in the face of a host of angels?&quot;

&quot;Let them try,&quot; Amielle swore, clutching onto her lover possessively.  
Thirteen scoffed.

&quot;This is simply unbelievable.  I never did understand humans, whether 
they had great powers or not.  But I can see that my presence here is 
futile.  I would have to kill you to claim what is mine, and that is not 
my duty.  Consider yourself...off the hook, for now.  But be warned, ye 
two:  the next time, you may not be so fortunate.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t care,&quot; said Pale, sparing a glance at Amielle, her fellow 
fallen angel.  &quot;Though we may be wrapped in darkness, we shall never 
fear the light.  It is this light we must seek&#151;this truth and this love.  
Even if we die in each other&#39;s arms, we will have shown the world, and 
the powers that be, the strength of love.&quot;  Another long period of 
silence passed.  Thirteen actually seemed to sigh.

&quot;I just do not understand,&quot; he whispered, as he slowly faded off into 
the distance.  He was never seen again.

A collective sigh came up from the group.

&quot;It&#39;s over,&quot; said Pale, leaning against her beloved.  Amielle smiled 
gently.

&quot;Yeah...about time that weirdo got out of our hair.  That&#39;s it, 
then&#151;everything&#39;s all wrapped up.&quot;

&quot;You gotta be kidding me!&quot; Mora exclaimed, throwing her hands up in the 
air.  &quot;This isn&#39;t quite the end, not by a long shot!  We still have one 
more loose thread that needs to be cut away before we can break out the 
champagne and start celebrating!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; they asked her.  The Cobra&#39;s face turned dark, and she looked 
over at Rin, Kailin, Marissa, and Sanaa.  They knew what she was talking 
about.

&quot;That woman, the one who took Lyn with her.  She has to pay for what 
she&#39;s done.  And as much as I hate that bitch Lyn, even I won&#39;t leave 
her to be sucked into that woman&#39;s world.  We need to save her, and 
clobber some sense into her head.&quot;  The few that really knew the 
Cobra&#151;Battle Divas, mostly&#151;smiled fondly, believing there was more to it 
than just that.  With a grave expression, everyone exchanged a nod of 
agreement, and the final phase of their operation soon began.

&quot;Ladies, the rescue mission is on.  We&#39;ve got a lot of work to do.&quot;

To be continued...

Epilogue

Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a desert.  There I saw 
a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous 
names and had seven heads and ten horns.  [...] This title was written
