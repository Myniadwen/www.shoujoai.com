<p>“The Solo Journey: overcoming  obstacles alone?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Amy Miracle woke up alone in the  wilderness, and as her senses returned to her, she could distinguish  various sensations drawing her out of the darkness. First there was  light—a bleary, soupy gray illumination above her that was most  likely a layer of clouds clotting the atmosphere and hiding the tiny  sin, which was indistinguishable from her viewpoint. The surface,  therefore, was monochromatic and bleak, an endless savannah made more  desolate by the grim sky. The plains were flat as far as she could  tell—oh, bother, her glasses had been cracked from the impact that  knocked her unconscious—and the horizon remained unbroken except  for a few blurs that might have been stones, the small oasis she had  been thrust into, and sporadic clumps of bracken, thistles, bushes,  and other tough plants that had adapted to this barren world. There  was also a long, flat stone laying nearby, which she had narrowly  avoided crashing into; reclining on it was a large lizard, dull-eyed  and weary, apathetic to its surroundings and the new visitor.</p>
<p>Well, she was definitely <em>alive</em>,  and that was something. Sound, smell, and touch came next in three  successful bombardments: a howling breeze was prevalent, and the  shriek of birds darting across the endless cloudy ocean made the  loneliness seem even gloomier. It was otherwise quiet, though,  because the wind didn’t pick up and there were no animals or  springs nearby (thinking of water suddenly made her thirsty); she  heard a very distant roar, and groped around for any equipment that  might’ve been brought with her. The dry grass beneath her was tough  and prickly, but more welcome than desolation; her right foot  throbbed, bleeding quite liberally now that all the bandages had  unraveled. Amy was forced to pluck clumps of grass and hold them to  her heel, wincing and hissing as she thought of what to do next.  Walking anywhere was completely out of the question since she had  nothing to support her injured limb, and a closer inspection of her  surroundings indicated she had nothing but her clothes to assist her,  unless nature felt gracious enough to lend a hand.</p>
<p>Amy was not used to surviving in the  wilderness. She was a scholar and a city girl—she had not even gone  camping since her days as a Girl Scout. She almost wore herself out  hobbling to the nearest tree so she could lean against it; her grass  wrappings were lost and soon the ground was painted scarlet. She took  several breaths and tried to calm herself. She had two doctorate  degrees and strong willpower; she was determined to go through with  this until she could reunite with her lost friends. Not even she  could say just how or why they had separated like that, but she  didn’t have the luxury to think just yet. First she had to find  something to eat, and fashion something to support her injury. Amy  looked to the tree and began contemplating its bounties.</p>
<p>She spotted a branch protruding out  that looked like it would make a decent crutch, but she would have to  do some climbing, and she would probably have to work hard to pry it  off. She searched around for any instrument she could use to cut it  loose, and saw there was a pile of smaller rocks gathered next to the  large one. The lizard jerked its head and stood on full alert as she  hopped over, so she made certain he would not perceive her as a  threat. Since it was not much bigger than an iguana, Amy would  probably be able to overpower it in a fight, but all the same…</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Just relax. I just want one of  these rocks. I won’t be able to get anywhere on this foot, so I  need something to support myself. I just want a rock.” The lizard  scurried off anyway, terrified of the gentle giant that stooped down  to gather stones. She picked out several spherical ones and two heavy  wedge-shaped rocks, and stuffed them all in various pockets. Amy  wasn’t terribly concerned about the condition of her clothes as she  returned to the tree and tentatively began to shimmy up its rough  bark: she had a hopeless sense of fashion, and her current outfit was  more suited for hard work than elegance. Besides, this was her life  on the line. What were a few rips, tears, and stains compared to  that?</p>
<p>“Ouch!” Amy shrieked as her grip  failed. Her hands slipped against the rough bark and were stung; her  legs were scraped as well, but she was thankful she wasn’t wearing  shorts. The tree had nothing to hold onto except for its gnarled  skin, and the branch was about five meters away. Amy hugged the trunk  close, crushing her breasts, and squeezed it with her thighs as she  tried again. Little by little, she sidled up the tree, her foot  burning out of control, until she came to the branch she had spied.  She reached out and pulled herself up from it…and promptly screamed  as it broke, sending her falling to the surface. Good thing the grass  broke her fall.</p>
<p>“Oof,” she groaned as she threw  the devilish branch off her stomach. “When the bough breaks, the  cradle definitely falls. Now all I need to do is summon the strength  to actually stand up!” It was tricky work considering her fall and  her wound, and the tree’s discarded limb had been thrown too far to  use as a support. Amy flopped around on her belly and pushed herself  with her arms, then hissed as she put weight on her knees and legs,  and reached out for her prize. Despite how easily it came loose, the  wood was sturdy and fit underneath her arm well, once she peeled the  bark off. Amy retreated to the large rock and caught her breath,  fearful of what future ordeals she would have to suffer through. All  that work just for a crutch…and she still had shelter, food, water,  protection, her glasses, and a beacon to worry about! Indeed, her  troubles were only just starting: it began to rain soon after she sat  down.</p>
<p>“Ahh, at least it waited until I  was out of that tree,” she remarked with glum optimism. It was a  light shower, though, and quite cool and refreshing against her skin.  Amy tried fashioning a cup from the branch leaves, but even a tub  wouldn’t have helped her out: the drizzle was too weak. She managed  to slurp down a few measly drops, that that only made things worse in  the long run: her thirst was fully realized, and she grew desperate.  Amy quickly began looking around for a better place to hide from the  weather, but every direction was empty; she could actually see the  point where the sky met the surface. Even if she was walking at full  speed, without hunger or thirst or the pain in her foot to worry  about, she would be horribly exposed wandering out there, and would  probably never be found. Her friends would certainly be drawn to  leafy, shaded areas amidst this wide savannah, so she resolved to  stay put and take another look around. Maybe there was a pool or a  grove she had overlooked. Amy could withstand the wind and rain, and  had no fear of wild animals; it was hunger and thirst that concerned  her.</p>
<p>The oasis she was temporarily  stranded in was much rougher than she had anticipated. Not long after  starting out, her feet were stretched and strained to their limit as  she stepped over rocks, waded through thick reeds infested with every  sort of bug imaginable, fell into a murky puddle (so much for keeping  her socks clean!), and squeezed through clusters of large plants.  Some were nearly like palm trees, and a few had even cast off their  fruit for Amy to gather. She </p>
<p>pounded at one with her rocks until  it broke open, but the juice was shockingly bitter and the flesh was  too tough. She barely managed to force a small mouthful down, and  groaned sickly as she went in search of better nourishment. Some of  the plants could easily pass for enormous mushrooms; they towered  over Amy’s head like parasols of the gods, and she dashed  underneath one of the broadest to escape from the rain. She didn’t  dare test to see if they were safe to eat—instead, she took her  glasses off and studied them for damage. The frame had been twisted  and bent a little, one of the lenses had a long, thin crack etched  diagonally, and there was a little dirt caked on from her recent  adventure, but they were otherwise in great shape. Amy put them away  (she only needed them for reading) and casually scanned the landscape  for any sign of food.</p>
<p>Her “oasis” was much larger than  she originally thought, or else she had been wrong all this time, and  had been deposited outside a forest or jungle. It was teeming with  greenery, like little herbs and weeds that could probably help her  wound, wild flowers and blossoms dangling above, great massive  sentinels dripping from the rain—also the mushrooms, of course,  which seemed no safer to eat in the wake of this new discovery—and  in the distance, unless she was being deceived by her gnawing hunger,  trees dangling fruit in the air. It was still too wet to venture out,  though, so Amy removed some of her clothes and wrung out the water.  She wrapped them around her waist, shivered to warm herself up, and  allowed her mind to catch up.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, fighting for her life  out in the middle of the wild had nearly drained her of philosophical  meditation. She tried to justify her presence there—just how  exactly <em>did</em> she end up out here all alone, completely cut off  from her friends and fellow travelers?—but no explanation seemed  sufficient, and she was left to wonder in circles until the rain  stopped. Oh well. It probably didn’t matter <em>how</em> or <em>why</em> she was lost, the fact was that Amy <em>was</em> lost, and she had to  survive until her friends came looking for her. Surely nobody would  be able to miss this forest if they were looking for somebody! Just  to be safe, Amy decided to make some beacons, and once the rain  finally settled down an hour later, she limped away from her crude  shelter and traced her steps back to the tough nuts she had tried to  eat. The juice may have been horrible, but it had a glorious crimson  color and stood out magnificently against the savannah’s dull  landscape. Amy dashed the juice against the grass, scooped out as  much of the flesh as she could, and spread it all out to spell  “HELP”. The sign needed to be big, though, so she would have to  gather more nuts (and probably more rocks), break them open, and  repeat the procedure. That would certainly keep her busy, but she was  too hungry to do much work, and her foot was agonizing.</p>
<p>Amy stumbled through the jungle a  second time, picking up familiar markers as she made her way to the  fruit trees (the mushrooms were easy to find). She didn’t recognize  any of the fruits, and a few were squashed beyond consumption, but  several were quite satisfying and filled her up quickly. She turned  her discarded outer shirt into a bag and filled it with fruit, then  trudged back to the palm trees, picking five nuts and putting them  into the bag. It was difficult balancing all this along with her  cane, and sometimes Amy was forced to put her weight on her bad foot.  The pain felt like searing cold pokers plunging into her nerves, and  she gnashed her teeth and even cried out.</p>
<p>Amy took an extra-long rest once she  reached her destination, dabbing her forehead and heel until her  clothes were soaked with sweat and blood, and was nearly tempted to  sleep. The cloudy gray skies were getting darker and colder, and a  heartless wind picked up that blew at her hair. </p>
<p>She hastily tied it up and found the  flat rock she discovered earlier; this would be her bed until  morning. She unfolded her shirt and covered herself with it like a  blanket, stuffing all her food inside so it wouldn’t get carried  away. She ate her fill and hoped any nearby predators would leave her  alone as she closed her eyes and waited for morning to come.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Amy Miracle woke up alone in the  wilderness, but since there are much worse places you can be (whether  or not you have company), she ate a quick breakfast and began her  labors. Having a doctorate in literature, she tried recalling the  actions of Robinson Crusoe, and how he had managed to make a living  out of whatever nature provided. Of course, he had been given almost  half a ship’s supplies to aid him, and his island was much larger  and more abundant with potential, and he didn’t have a foot  bleeding relentlessly to impede him. On the other hand, he had much  less hope of being rescued than Amy did.</p>
<p>Making the sign was not quite as  physically perplexing as Amy had feared. The worst part was cracking  open the nuts, but she had an abundant supply of stones, and they  were perfectly suited to smash and cut. She mixed some of the blood  from her injury into the juice and spread it out conservatively; the  flesh was fairly uncooperative, and most nuts only yielded a small  bounty. Her ingenuity wouldn’t be beaten so easily, though, and she  used the shells, the peels and rinds from her fruit, rocks, branches,  and even some of her own clothes to finish the sign. She battened  down any loose articles, and stood eagerly as a breeze kicked up,  rolling the clouds back and revealing a bashful blue sky. Amy took a  deep breath and smiled in spite of her situation, taking pride in her  humble accomplishments. Two days ago, she had been resting quietly in  her comfortable room, studying a rare manuscript as she idly snacked  and casually adjusted the temperature to her liking. Now look at  where she was!</p>
<p>She leaned on her left food and  looked up to see a bird circling over the clear sky. It was a  majestic creature, with broad wings that shone red, blue, and green  in the morning light, and a strong body with talons powerful enough  to snap bones in two. Because Amy could see it so distinctly, even  without her glasses, it must’ve either been an incredibly large  bird, or it was descending very rapidly. In any case, she took two  cautious steps back, and observed the creature spiraling to the  surface. As it landed, wings fluttering like a kaleidoscope, Amy  realized that <em>both</em> her assumptions were correct: it was much  larger than normal birds, and it had been approaching quickly; she  assumed it had spotted her and was coming down for a closer look. But  this was not strictly a bird, but rather a harpy, descended from  avians to resemble humans. Feathers sprouted from her head instead of  hair, and great gossamer wings shot out from her arms like a flaming  rainbow; her legs ended in claws, and she had a sharp nose and  sharper eyes. Amy was startled by her appearance: she had seen this  woman before.</p>
<p>“It’s you!” she exclaimed,  beaming joyfully at the sight of another intelligent creature. The  bird-woman gave a start and jerked back, horrified and infuriated.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Oh shit, I know you!! You were  with those bitches back on that Amazon planet, weren’t you? Get the  hell away from me! I don’t want any more to do with you!”</p>
<p>“Wait, don’t go! Amy chased  after her in spite of her wound, but stumbled and fell face-first in  the grass. The harpy fluttered away, laughing at the poor woman’s  predicament.</p>
<p>“Ha! It serves you right, after  what your friends put me through!” Amy raised her grassy face and  sputtered; her eyes shone pitiably.</p>
<p>“But why are you mad at <em>me</em> for something <em>they</em> did?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter! You’re  part of that peanut gallery!”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair! Do people  judge you based on the actions of your friends and family?” Amy’s  probing question terminated the harpy’s flight, and she skidded to  the ground and jumped over to her, as fast as a hare. Amy struggled  to stand; the harpy bent down to pick her up, in spite of her better  judgment.</p>
<p>“God-damn it, I hate it when  people are right. Okay, so maybe I don’t have anything against you  personally, but if I see any of those fuckers around here, I won’t  hesitate to leave them behind!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t be so harsh on  them,” Amy begged. “Most of them are very nice people, and I love  them. Some are…more difficult than others, but I’d like to  believe I can get through to them. Well, for better or worse, they’re  not here right now. I’m afraid I’ll have to rely on your  hospitality if I’m to make it anywhere.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I saw your sign while I was  flying around. Uh, you do realize that it will be hard to see that  from the <em>ground</em>, right?” Amy hung her head timidly, rubbing  her fingers.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what else to do.  But it did work, right? You’re here.”</p>
<p>“And what makes you think I’ll  help you?!” she screeched. Amy gave her a penetrating smile, face  glowing with purest love.</p>
<p>“If I ask nicely, you might! I  could use a friend, and I think you could too.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had it up to here with  people who say they’re my friend!” she spat. But the harpy  couldn’t resist that trusting stare, so she rubbed her face and  adapted a more hospitable tone. “Uh, hey, what’s your name,  anyway?”</p>
<p>“It’s Amy, Amy Miracle.” She  raised her eyebrows in surprise.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t happen to be <em>doctor</em> Miracle, would you? <em>The</em> Dr. Miracle?!”</p>
<p>“One and the same,” she blushed.  The harpy rolled her eyes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“And here I thought you were some  kind of interstellar being. The rumors sure have been exaggerated!!”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that’s my fault,”  Amy laughed. “I really wanted to guarantee my privacy, so I did my  best to throw everyone off the trail. I guess it worked! So what’s  your name?”</p>
<p>“When I’m outside my home world,  people just call me ‘Breathless’, but my real name is Ferrara  Drahnis Wynhmn il Firtwyt-Ly. It  basically translates as ‘from the house of Firtwyt, she who leaves  those in her wake breathless with awe and fear’.”</p>
<p>“Would it be all right if I just  called you Ferrara?” Amy’s sweet smile disarmed the harpy, and  she muttered an affirmative, still unsure about this mysterious,  gentle, innocent lady. She was not merely dwelling on her two  previous encounters with Miracle’s crew: Ferrara had been assaulted  before by other treasure-hunters, some just as greedy and ruthless as  Vimmy, and had been cast away from her own kind after exhibiting  excessively violent and belligerent behavior. That wasn’t very  fair: Ferrara merely had a problem with possessiveness—but she only  acted that way with things she believed nobody else had claimed. In  truth, she was only violent towards thieves, and judging by the  intensity of her emotions, one could surmise she was either a  treasure-hunter of unsurpassed quality, or blessed with great luck at  finding artifacts, for so many people followed her precedent and,  finding a disagreeable harpy amassing all that wealth, assumed this  was an evil creature, and they the virtuous warrior out to free it  from her unworthy hands.</p>
<p>“You have every right to be  offended,” Amy admitted as Ferrara grumbled about her history. “I  completely agree with your philosophy. No matter who finds something  first, it’s theirs to keep and nobody has the right to take it away  from them. But you have to remember there are some people out there  who don’t want that treasure being used for ‘the wrong purposes’.  I know you don’t want to hear this, Fer, but the next time that  happens, maybe you could try being more diplomatic.” The harpy  glared nastily.</p>
<p>“Look, you’re pretty ignorant  about all this, so I’ll forget you said that. But just <em>you</em> remember, Dr. Miracle: not everyone responds to diplomacy. In fact,  that only pisses them off even more! They come in and attack me like  I’m some kind of abomination from Hell, even if I just try to talk  my way out of it! No, that’s not the way I’m doing things  anymore. The only things people respond to is a sharp tongue and  brute force! You’re better off without them.”</p>
<p>“Are you suggesting I spend the  rest of my life trapped here with you?” she said slyly.</p>
<p>“Not <em>trapped.</em> I came here  on a ship, just like you. I just decided to have a look around, so I  got out and flew. That’s when I saw your message.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you could give me a  ride on your ship? I really have to find my friends, and I want to  make sure the <em>Dauntless</em> is safe.” Ferrara gave her a nasty  expression, which seemed to be a trademark of hers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Are you saying you <em>want</em> to  run around with those people? I’ll admit, my life isn’t pleasant  by a long shot, and if you’re not tough, you’ll fall behind! But  it’s gotta be better than hangin’ around with those assholes!”</p>
<p>“I told you that assumptions like  that aren’t fair,” Amy said firmly. “It’s so easy to judge a  people or a species based on the actions of a few, but you shouldn’t  do that. You say I’m ignorant, but what about you?”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay, I’m sorry!” she  exclaimed wildly. “I take it back, all right? It’s just…some of  those people pulled all the wrong strings when I saw them.”</p>
<p>“Give them another chance,” she  said softly. “Try and be nicer to them. If they could see the kind  of person you are now, I know they’ll come around. Of course, we’d  have to <em>find</em> them first!”</p>
<p>“You really do like being around  them, don’t you?” Ferrara studied Amy with quiet awe, and  attempted to smile. She was a strange woman, for sure, but she had a  big heart, a lot of courage, and a bundle of patience stronger than  nine cords of steel tied together. Nobody had ever weathered  Ferrara’s storms before, at least not for this long. She decided to  drop her guard a little, and relaxed her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I guess I’ll help you out,  then. If it’s really that important to you…”</p>
<p>“I appreciate that,” she  whispered, smiling so beautifully. Ferrara blushed and looked away.</p>
<p>“But don’t get the wrong idea!  I’m not going anywhere near those so-called friends of yours!  They’ll just think I kidnapped you!”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I could talk to them,”  she attempted. Ferrara relaxed her tensions again and smiled feebly.</p>
<p>“You’re a very sweet woman, Amy,  and I feel like I could trust you. You’ve treated me better than  anyone I’ve ever met, and for that, I’m thankful. I just…don’t  think I could trust any of them. Besides, I’m sort of in a hurry. I  came here to find a treasure, and I don’t intend on leaving until I  get it.” She laughed sourly and added, “Odds are, they’ll come  after it as soon as I find it!”</p>
<p>“Then we should look for that  first,” Amy suggested cheerfully. “If we find it and your, uh,  unlucky streak continues, I’ll have found my friends! If they don’t  come, then at least you can carry on without interruptions. Sound  like a good plan?” Ferrara grinned and admitted it was a unique  idea, but there was just one small problem:</p>
<p>“It’s a long way away, and the  only way to reach it would be by flight.”</p>
<p>“I’m not too heavy!” Amy  exclaimed as she stood up, grimacing lightly as she put weight on her  foot. Ferrara asked her what was wrong, and knelt down to examine the  bloody limb—perhaps the first time in years she showed compassion  to another being. Being an adventurer, she was </p>
<p>always prepared for instances such  as this, and wound a bandage around Amy’s foot that was guaranteed  to survive the harsh environment. Amy smiled warmly as her amateur  nurse stood up again.</p>
<p>“You’re very kind.”</p>
<p>“Uh…don’t mention it. So you  were saying?”</p>
<p>“I was saying that perhaps you  could carry me. I think it would be a great way of starting our  friendship.” Ferrara stood aghast at this woman’s quiet tenacity:  she had clearly underestimated her.</p>
<p>“Are you planning on following me  no matter what I say?”</p>
<p>“I can’t survive for long on my  own,” Amy admitted, “and it does sound like the best way to find  my friends.” Ferrara sighed in defeat—even though her eyes were  twinkling—and bent down so Amy could climb on her back.</p>
<p>“Oof! You were saying something  about not being heavy?”</p>
<p>“Oh, quit complaining; you’re  stronger than that!” Ferrara glowed warmly and carefully took off  into the air. Soon her burden was forgotten as the wind picked up and  they passed through wild blue skies together, on and up into the  clouds.</p>
<p>The flight over the vast, lonely  wilderness was incomparable to anything Amy had experienced; it  wasn’t like riding in a jet, a helicopter, or even a hang-glider.  The best way to describe it would be to consider what it was like to  mount Pegasus. A creature that magnificent would be insulted if you  saddled it, so you would have to ride bareback, relying on your knees  and arms to hang on. Pegasus can fly, so the danger of falling off is  heightened, but so is the thrill of soaring through the air. The land  seems closer and more personal than if you were in a vehicle; you can  spot things you never would’ve seen, such as the details of a  river, or a herd of zebra galloping over the veldt, or trees  clustered in wild patterns, standing guard before imposing mountains,  some peaks climbing so tall that you could nearly reach them. This is  what Amy saw and felt as she clung tight to Ferrara; the world was  bombastic with marvels, and it made her silent. She didn’t speak  until she sighted their destination, a gargantuan ziggurat boldly  conspicuous in the wild, a structure ancient beyond reckoning.  Doubtless there was something magic about it.</p>
<p>“In there!” Ferrara shouted.  Amy’s eyes were annoyed with tears; they poured out in response to  the rushing wind, but she didn’t want to cover them and miss the  beauty unfolding beneath her (she also didn’t want to overlook the  possibility that her friends might be down there, experimenting with  their own rescue signals).</p>
<p>“Do you know anything about this  world?” she yelled. She had to repeat herself before she got her  answer:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ll tell you once we land.  We’ll rest before heading out.” Amy understood, and waited  patiently, her hair dancing like autumn leaves drifting in a gale.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Ferrara fell on her hands and knees  as Amy climbed down from her back; her entire body shivered from  overexertion, and her breath came harsh and heavy. As light as Amy  claimed she was, she had remained a burden for the better part of an  hour, and not even the most powerful people can bear a weight without  rest. She approached the weakened woman and gently began to massage  her, caressing weary muscles and soothing aching joints. Chandra was  best suited for this task--even Fuuka could’ve done a better  job--but Amy was the only person around. As amateurish as she was,  her touch was loving and soft, and soon the harpy was relaxing  comfortably. To pass the time, she kept her word and informed Miracle  about the planet they were visiting.</p>
<p>It had obviously gone unnoticed by  the rest of the galaxy, partly because it was greatly removed from  all known hyper drive lanes, and partly because what little  information there was about the world was very cryptic and  foreboding. According to the reports Ferrara studied, no trace of  civilization, or even intelligent life, had ever sullied the nameless  planet (which she humbly dubbed Wynhmn). The  ziggurat they were sheltering in was briefly cited in those obscure  reports; it was apparently the craft of a creature higher than any  beast, yet lacking the spark of conscience that was so prevalent  amongst sentient beings. Ferrara honestly couldn’t say if this  entity still existed, or if it had progeny, or if there were other  monuments to its presence; she was mostly concerned with the treasure  it had left behind.</p>
<p>“What it all  boils down to is that it’s a jewel, cut from an ore that has long  since been extinct, so it’s literally one of a kind. It’s been  said that this jewel can communicate with the dead, and can even  summon them to perform your bidding.”</p>
<p>“Sounds like  something out of <em>Gulliver’s  Travels</em>,” Amy murmured. She  explained that in that book, there had been a king who had the power  to summon a spirit for a whole day, so that he might interview them  and seek their advice. Ferrara nodded stiffly.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  something like that. Anyway, that’s the extent of my knowledge, and  I had to piss off a lot of people and do some pretty nasty things to  get all that. Of course, it would’ve been easier if I had the Tome  of Treasures in my possession…”</p>
<p>“We have  that!” Amy blurted. Ferrara’s eyes flared open, and she tackled  Amy in spite of her sore muscles.</p>
<p>“You’re shitting me! You mean  you people were the ones that stole it from Bibliopolis?! No wonder I  kept running into you in those out-of-the-way places!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Umm, it’s not what you think!”  she squealed helplessly. “We’re only borrowing it for awhile.”</p>
<p>“<em>Right!</em>” she purred  devilishly. “You’re just borrowing it. Okay, I believe you. You  seem like an honest person! I wish I had known all that before--well,  maybe not,” she corrected. “If I had known you people had the  Tome, I really <em>would’ve</em> been your enemy! Ha, talk about  hypocritical! Anyway, I don’t suppose you read about the  Einherjaria Jewel?”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she squeaked. “It’s  a really comprehensive book. I barely skimmed through it.”</p>
<p>“So you don’t care about it?!  Amy, that book is priceless! It can make you richer than the Norgrim  Vicegerent--hell, the whole freakin’ <em>population!</em>”</p>
<p>“I’m not interested in amassing  useless wealth,” she answered honestly. “I’m just happy for the  experiences and the company…although I did see a few items that  looked interesting!”</p>
<p>“There, see?” Ferrara grinned,  giving Amy a gentle shove. “You’ve got an avaricious streak in  ya! Here, help me stand.”</p>
<p>“Can you walk?” Ferrara was  amazingly easy to lift up, even lighter than Amy herself. This wasn’t  surprising considering her genetic ancestry: one of the reasons birds  and their kin are able to stay aloft is their hollow bones.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel 100, if that’s  what you mean,” she groaned, “but I’m feeling better than  expected. You really did a number on me both ways, Dr. Miracle!”  Amy giggled bashfully as Ferrara’s boisterous laughter echoed  through the hollow monument; the ziggurat was almost completely void  of decoration, so gnawingly empty that no shadows could be seen. But  what a sight the two of them would’ve been if anybody was watching!  Neither one of them were suited to travel very far--Amy had her bad  foot and Ferrara was still recovering from her flight--and so they  took frequent rests, encouraging one another and grinning at their  own pathetic struggles. Ferrara’s curiosity got the better of her,  and she asked about Amy’s foot--but her response was different this  time.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of stigmata?  When I was first inflicted with this ailment, several people had the  opinion that it was a sign of God. If that were true, however my  wrists and forehead would be bleeding as well.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Stigmata echoes the wounds  inflicted upon Christ as He was crucified. Nails were driven through  His wrists and feet, and a crown of thorns was forced on His head.  You used to hear about many instances of stigmata, and they sometimes  coincided with sightings of the Virgin Mary, or other religious  figureheads, like saints. I don’t personally believe that this is  the same thing, but it’s an interesting theory. It’ actually  funny to think about, since I haven’t set foot inside a church  since I was a little girl.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I don’t understand religions,”  Ferrara grunted lazily. “I mean, I know why people hold them in  such high regard, but isn’t it better to just keep your mind  focused on the real world? If you get something out of it, or if it  helps make the universe a better place, all the more power to ya. I  just think it’s silly how some people can get so immersed in it;  it’s like they’re voluntarily being brainwashed.”</p>
<p>“Does your species have any  religion?”</p>
<p>“Sure, but I never got involved in  any of em’. I might convert if this gem turns out to be the genuine  article, though! Let’s keep going!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Ferrara glowed  with warmth and purity, reflecting the light that Amy had shed  before--the love that she kept from her faith even if her attendance  had slackened.</p>
<p>“You’re a lot worse off than me!  All I have are worn-out muscles; you’ve got a bleeding foot and  those asinine friends! I never thought I’d say this, but you are  one tough fucker!”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” Amy grinned  sheepishly. “I’m, uh, flattered you think so.”</p>

<p>Because the ziggurat was so empty,  finding Ferrara’s treasure was a simple matter; it was <em>getting</em> there that provided a problem. After creeping down a long, dark,  narrow hallway, the two women had to ascend a spiraling staircase,  where each step was cloven in irregular patterns: some slanted  diagonally, others were carved like lozenges, and some had to be  scaled like footholds of a mountain. When this obstacle (and about  thirty minutes of puffing and sweating) passed them, the women had to  sidle through an even skinnier hallway, then they had to  descend--carefully--down a series of ladders and rope bridges, where  they finally came to rest on a ledge that overlooked a deep canyon.  Amy dropped a stone down the pit and waited for it to hit bottom, but  they were so far from the surface that not even its echo could be  heard.</p>
<p>“I think you can manage from  here!” she said with a watery smile. Across the ravine--too far  even for Athena to jump--was the titular treasure, which stood out as  its perfectly circular jewel glowed a ghostly golden-white. Ferrara  smiled gently and told Amy she’d be right back; Miracle was quite  content to act as an observer. After everything they went through, it  felt like cheating to acquire something so easily, but neither of  them were about to question their good fortune.</p>
<p>As expected, getting out was much  easier than getting in, but since Amy’s food supply was almost  gone, they couldn’t dawdle. Rushing out hastily, they met a dim  twilight sky: they had spent the entire day together, growing from  enemies into friends. Ferrara ferried Amy to the surface and found a  nice spot to rest in; she also flew up to harvest whatever fruit she  could find in the nearby trees. Amy felt a little guilty for slowing  the other woman down, especially since </p>
<p>she had been completely useless  Inside the ziggurat, but Ferrara assured the older woman that her  presence had been very welcome--even essential--more like an anchor  than a burden.</p>
<p>“You were right, you know,” she  said as they split a melon. “I did need a friend. It’s been too  long since I’ve been able to trust anyone. How’s your foot?”</p>
<p>“Aggravating as always,” she  replied sweetly. “What about you?”</p>
<p>“Strong as ever! But I’m very  tired, too. We should probably rest until tomorrow. Goodness knows  we’ve earned it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Goodnight, then, and thanks  for putting up with me.”</p>
<p>“I could say the same thing,”  she grinned. Amy was already drifting off, and soon she was enveloped  by the soft caress of slumber. Ferrara gazed longingly at her mousy  face, her tangled brunette hair, her shabby clothes, and her cracked  glasses, and felt overwhelming love for this creature. Lightly, she  kissed her forehead, cast her feathery arm over her like a blanket,  and slept alongside her.</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Amy: Wait a minute! Am I going to  have to do the previews all by myself?! That isn’t fair! I don’t  have anyone to play off! Where’s Rachel? Since all this is her  fault, the least she can do is be here for me when I need her! sigh  I hope I find the others soon. I’m very lonely…and worried… But  I can beat this! Yes!! I’ll keep my head lifted high and my eyes  glued to the horizon! In the meantime, let’s see if I can guess  what the next chapter’s going to be about! For that matter, just  how long can we milk this “everyone is lost and must survive in the  wild” shtick? You’d think it would be getting stale eventually!  Oh well, at least it’s good character development. Please stay  tuned for the next chapter, “Campfire: four stories are told”,  and hopefully I’ll get some company! Now where’d that dratted  genie run off to…?</p>
<p>Ferrara: Hey, what am I, invisible?</p>
