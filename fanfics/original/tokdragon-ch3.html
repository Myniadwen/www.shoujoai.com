~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Three Days Later, Tokyo Bay, Japan 

Yoko and Jun gaped at the vastness of Tokyo Bay. Stretching from one 
side of the setting to the other, it was filled with all sorts of 
people. Tourists entering from new ships, taking pictures of their first 
time in Japan, merchants and traders, men carrying shipments of goods to 
be distributed to various Japanese companies that stretch out so far as 
to reach Hokkaido and Kyushu. Hard as it was to believe, Yoko had never 
been to Tokyo Bay before. She had been living in Japan for a few years 
now, but she had really seen relatively little of it. Jun, on the other 
hand, had been here dozens of times. And it was nothing to her. Both 
girls had duffel bags slung over their shoulders, and both held their 
tournament invites in hand 

&#147;So this is Tokyo Bay, huh?&#148; Yoko asked. 

Jun yawned discourteously. &#147;&#133;Sure is. Stinks of fish and sea water.&#148;

&#147;Lighten up, Jun.&#148; Yoko said chidingly. &#147;I&#146;ve never competed in a 
tournament before. I&#146;m really excited about this.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, well, let&#146;s just see what other guys we have to work with. I hope 
this tournament brings us some heavy hitters.&#148;

Jun did just that, looking over at the crowds that were forming around 
their selected boat. It was a luxury vessel, far larger than what she 
expected. And the crowds were a little larger than she expected to. But 
quite a few of those people were just waving off their friends and 
family, the ones who were going to compete in the God of Fighting Grand 
Championships. She took that into account and just looked at the number 
of people in fighting gear. Around twenty something, and some probably 
weren&#146;t dressed yet (this was a possibility since both Jun and Yoko were 
in their casual street clothes). Jun continued to search through the 
crowds of fighters to see who might look like a challenge, but then 
gasped with shock and excitement as she saw someone who she would have 
never expected to be there. 

&#147;Oh my god&#133;!&#148; Jun said in a daze. 

Yoko noticed Jun&#146;s stunned disposition. &#147;What is it, Jun?&#148;

&#147;Look!&#148; She screamed, pointing at the fighter&#146;s direction, &#147;Look who it 
is!&#148;

Yoko looked over to whomever Jun was pointing at. Over at the pier, 
surrounded by screaming girls and nerdish young men, was a strident 
figure. He dressed in a pure black suit, donning a pair of shades and 
running a hand through his wavy black hair. Flashes of cameras were 
constantly going off, while people scrambled to him, handing him scraps 
of paper and a pen, obviously for autographs. When Yoko took a deeper 
look at him, she was astounded.

&#147;It can&#146;t be!&#148; Yoko said brightly &#147;Ryoma Taneda?&#148; 

Jun giggled excitedly. &#147;It&#146;s really him! I can&#146;t believe it&#146;s really 
him! He&#146;s one of the greatest fighters in the world! I don&#146;t believe 
that I&#146;m really gonna fight in the same tournament as Ryoma Taneda! The 
real action star!&#148;   

Yoko was a bit more cautious, however. &#147;That&#146;s strange&#133;&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s strange?&#148; Jun reciprocated 

&#147;Ryoma Taneda is a really strong fighter. Action star or not, I know how 
powerful he is. Don&#146;t you think it&#146;s odd that virtual unknowns like us 
are competing in a tournament with one of the most famous Japanese 
fighters?&#148;

Jun thought about it. &#147;Hmm. That&#146;s true. You kinda have a point there, 
but you said you&#146;re the daughter of Tsukasa Asagawa, right?&#148;

Yoko nodded &#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Well he was a legend in Sunset City, if I&#146;m not mistaken. That&#146;s 
probably how they know you. Plus, my dad&#146;s got lots of connections and 
stuff. And I&#146;ve been in a few junior Judo tournaments, nothing fancy. I 
suppose that&#146;s how they got a hold of me.&#148;

That still wasn&#146;t a satisfactory answer for Yoko, but, &#147;&#133;I guess so.&#148;

&#147;C&#146;mon, let&#146;s see if we can get his autograph!&#148; Jun grabbed Yoko by 
wrist, then pulled her over to the group of people that were currently 
surrounding Ryoma Taneda. The Asagawa-girl sighed and let the eager Jun 
pull her over, then looked around while she walked. Most of the fighters 
were male, pretty strong looking, pretty tough, but Yoko suspected that 
she could handle them. When her eyes crossed over to a neighbouring 
pier, they stopped. Yoko squinted at the person she saw standing there A 
woman. A Chinese woman. With long dark hair, amethyst eyes and&#133;

Yoko&#145;s heart skipped a beat. &#147;&#133; Li Ming&#133;?&#148;

The girl vanished, slipping inside the boat from the other pier. Yoko 
froze with shock. Could it really have been Li Ming? After all this 
time? No. There was no way it could be. Yoko shook her head to try and 
stop thinking about her. That would do her no good, especially when she 
was about to compete in a tournament. Jun turned around, away from the 
Ryoma Taneda crowds when Yoko stopped walking. She was more than aware 
of that haunted, spacey look on her friend&#146;s face. 

&#147;Yoko?&#148; Jun said the name with concern. &#147;Everything okay?&#148;

It took her a moment to respond. &#147;I-I&#133; I&#146;m fine&#133;&#148;

Far above the crowds of fighters and fans of Ryoma Taneda, were the 
cabins of the ship  (which had been dubbed &#145;Grand Soma&#146; ). The master 
cabin, well decorated in a blunt, metallic Germanic design, contained 
the man behind all this. Reinhalt Schwarzluft. Seated in his &#146;throne&#146;,  
the leader of the KAIGA Group sipped his glass of brandy, before 
lowering it from his lips and swirling it around. His face beamed a dark 
smirk, then turned his eyes to the glass porthole that showed him what 
was going on below. 

&#147;Everything is going smoothly,&#148; He said to himself &#147;The tournament will 
be a success.&#148;

He turned his head around to look at the receptionist across the cabin. 
&#147;Miss Keiko. The time has come for the ship to depart. Once all the 
fighters have assembled in the Grand Hall, address them all about this 
current situation.&#148;

Miss Keiko, Reinhalt&#146;s private secretary, nodded. &#147;I understand, sir.&#148;

The woman then left the room, out into one of the main corridors of the 
Grand Soma. Down on the main pier, the fighters were already entering 
the boat, one by one, entering through the three gateways that offered 
passage into the inside. Some said goodbye to their family and friends 
who wished them, well, others (Like Ryoma Taneda) had to plough his way 
through to get anywhere. Among those crowds were Yoko and Jun The two 
martial artists entered with the rest of the group, then spilled into 
the carpeted corridors of the Grand Soma. Eventually, all the fighters 
managed to get aboard. As both Jun and Yoko took the time to look around 
the fancy ship, an intercom came on, addressing all the fighters who had 
made into onto this ship for the 11.00 deadline. 

&#147;Could all tournament fighters please follow the left wing corridor into 
the Grand Hall. There you will be debriefed about the rules and 
regulations for the God of Fighting Grand Championships.&#148;

&#147;You heard her,&#148;  Jun said to Yoko. &#147;Lets go.&#148;

Jun, Yoko, and the rest of the tournament fighters, did as they were 
requested and walked down the corridor, to the Grand Hall. It was large, 
vast, and very elegantly designed, with a particularly late Victorian 
design. Everything from the cushioned seats to overhanging chandeliers 
followed that motif. Soon, the entire group of fighters moved into the 
Grand Hall and took their seats from the many that had been laid out 
from them. Near the ceiling of that room was a balcony, and after 
fifteen minutes of waiting, someone emerged to address the tournament 
fighters. 

She stepped up, clipboard in hand, and spoke to the crowds below her. 
&#147;Welcome all. Welcome to the God of Fighting Grand Championships. You 
have all been selected from the four corners of the world, to 
participate in this tournament. It will be held on an island just a few 
miles off the Japanese coast, called Kakuri You shall be staying there 
for the next four days, and I am sure you will enjoy the facilities that 
we have to offer you. But before you reach the island, I am requested to 
relay the rules and organization of this tournament.&#148;

Miss Keiko looked at her clipboard before continuing. &#147;The rules that 
will be conducted in the ring are as such. No weapons. The intentional 
killing of your opponent is *strictly* forbidden. Any who dares to break 
that rule with be charged to the fullest extent of Japanese law. Once 
you enter the ring to fight, you cannot leave it until the victor is 
decided. Anyone who leaves the ring during a match will be disqualified. 
The matches will be observed via security cameras that have been placed 
around the island. If you are found breaking any of these rules, we will 
take immediate action.&#148;
 
&#147;Tomorrow morning, at 9.00 sharp, all 32 participants will be placed in 
pairs in 16 individual arenas dotted around the coastline of the island. 
You will be handed a red crystal. You fight the person on your field and 
the winner will receive the crystal of the defeated. The winner will 
proceed to the next arena where you will fight your next opponent upon 
their arrival. Again, the defeated person of that fight will hand their 
two crystals to the winner. Once you have earned four crystals, it means 
that you have automatically gained entry into the quarter finals. 
Proceed to the checkpoint, hand the guard your four crystals, and you 
will fight in the quarter final match. Following that, the tournament&#146;s 
semi finals will continue on the following day. Once the semi-finals are 
completed, the finals will be carried out on the day after that. The 
final match will be held inside the central residence of the island, the 
Stone Ruins, with tournament liaison, Mr. Reinhalt Schwarzluft as a 
spectator. The winner will be given a cash sum equal to 200,000 in their 
chosen currency,  and will be given the title, &#145;God of Fighting&#145;&#148;

&#147;We reach Kakuri Isle in three hours. You may feel free to enjoy the 
facilities of the Grand Soma until we reach there. Once at the island, 
you may train or prepare yourself for the tournament in our twelve 
selected gyms before its starts. If you have any further questions, 
please speak to one of the staff members who will designate you to one 
of the tournament advisors. Fight hard, and may you have good luck.&#148;

Yoko blinked as Miss Keiko walked back into the room she had come from. 
That whole speech really took it to her. But there was no turning back 
now. The brunette turned to Jun, who was sitting next to her, to see 
what she thought.

&#147;Well?&#148; Yoko enquired.

Jun ran a hand through her ginger hair. &#147;Bit confusing. I thought it&#146;d 
be just a little arena kinda thing. Guess if we&#146;re going to an island to 
settle this business, it&#146;d be more likely for all that fuss. Does change 
a few things though&#133;&#148;

&#147;Ho, ho, ho!&#148; A voice bellowed from behind. &#147;You needn&#146;t worry my 
Japanese princesses!&#148;

Both Jun and Yoko turned around to look at the seat behind them as they 
heard a stout man calling to them. And stout he was. The man was tall, 
very tall, the girls actually had to look up to get a good look at his 
face. And he was muscular. His muscles bugled against the fabric of his 
black string vest. Aside from his large, intimidating presence of body, 
he seemed quite cheerful and jolly. 

&#147;Who the heck are you, big guy?&#148; Jun quipped. 

The solid giant pounded his chest with a single fist. &#147;The name&#146;s 
Steinler! A proud fighter from my motherland, Ireland! You lasses better 
watch yourselves! I&#146;m a gentleman, but I&#146;m going for that 200,000!&#148;

&#147;You better watch out for me&#133;&#148; Jun said with an arrogant smile. &#147;I&#146;ve 
taken down guys just as large as you are Mr. Steinler.&#148;

Steinler just grinned. &#147;Heh, heh, heh. We&#146;ll see.&#148;

Yoko looked at both Jun and Steinler. Only a couple of words had been 
exchanged between them and it already seemed like she had a rival. With 
so many awesome fighters competing in this, it was going to be a 
tournament to remember. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kakuri Isle complex, Kakuri Isle, Pacific Ocean

&#147;Doh! Ja, doh, jah!&#148;

Yoko pummelled the black heavy bag with magnificently timed blow after 
magnificently timed blow Punches, roundhouses, elbow strikes, palm 
strikes, knee kicks, all centred at the spot she had set for herself on 
the heavy bag. She recoiled with a final punch, slipping her body back 
into a fighting stance, both arms up, one fist at her side, the other 
near her chin, body slightly tilted. 

The sweat from another of Yoko&#146;s hard fought workouts dribbled down her 
soft face and pouting cheeks. Her breath was quick, her chest heaving 
upwards and downwards as she drew more and more oxygen into herself. It 
might have seemed strange to some, but she really did work hard. For 
such a gentle, kind girl, she was dedicated to her training. Maybe it 
was because of her missing her father. When Tsukasa died, she and her 
brother had to deal with many hardships. Perhaps uphold the style that 
her father had fought so hard to perfect was a way of keeping his spirit 
alive After all, martial arts was a big part of the Asagawa Family&#146;s 
lifestyle.

Yoko lowered her guard, then eased herself. She wiped the sweat from her 
face, and took a look around. The journey from the ship had been fairly 
brief, just a couple hours, really As soon as they landed, Jun and Yoko 
were guided to the room they would be staying in till the tournament was 
over with. After a slapping meal served up by the 23 chefs at hand on 
the island, Yoko decided to go to one of the gyms she was told about to 
train. She had invited Jun to come with her, but she waved Yoko off, 
saying, &#145;I&#146;m as ready as I&#146;ll ever be&#146;. In other words, she was 
desperate to catch up with Ryoma Taneda and snag his autograph. And, 
flirt with a couple guys while she was at it. So it was at this gym that 
Yoko had come to train. Surrounded by equipment and mats, Yoko was the 
only one here. Which was good, she liked to train alone. But that didn&#146;t 
last long. The door across the room flew open, and a boy stepped 
through, perhaps only three or four years older than she was The boy 
strode over to one of the heavy bags near Yoko&#146;s, and began laying into 
it, not sparing Yoko a glance. The Asagawa-girl watched him unashamedly. 
There was something unique about him. Not least his silver hair and gold 
eyes. His current garbs were clearly his battle attire, a pair of black 
leggings with golden Aztec-like prints, a open white trench coat with 
gold around the edges (beneath that trench coat was nothing but a black 
string vest), around his wrists were two black bracers, obviously 
weighted. On his feet were two Chinese-inspired moccasins, thin and 
polished, and around his neck was a thin golden chain. 

Yoko could not interpret what style used that form of dress. Nor what 
style that man&#146;s strikes could possibly belong to. But what she was 
aware of was his strength. The boy was strong, very strong. Though his 
voice, spirit and demeanour were silent, his Chi burned with a rage so 
strong it transcended anything that Yoko had sensed before. He would be 
a tough opponent.

&#147;Hello,&#148; Yoko tried her best not to sound nosy when she spoke to him. 
&#147;My name&#146;s Yoko. What&#146;s yours?&#148;

The man continued to hammer away at the punching bag. He remained silent 
for a few more seconds, before lowering his fists and parting his lips. 

&#147;I have no name,&#148; He said. &#147;But people call me Xiangau.&#148;

Yoko nodded &#147;I see.&#148; 

Xiangau went back to hitting the punching bag. Yoko did the same, but 
kept her eyes on Xiangau His strikes were swift, and thrown from the 
joint of the arm. Mostly palm strikes, and the occasional punch. 
Considering the smoothness with which he struck, Yoko assumed that his 
style had to have been very polished and time-tested. Which didn&#146;t bode 
well for her. Older fighting styles tended to be far more powerful than 
newer variations. There were exceptions to this rule, like Jeet Kune Do, 
for example, but this tended to be the case for most situations. For the 
most part, Asagawa-style was new, developed in the 50&#146;s by her 
grandfather, Sousuke Asagawa. He mixed the disciplines of Ju-jitsu, 
Shotokan Karate, and Wu Shu he had learned in his travels to create 
something very lethal The Asagawa style of combat arts. 

Whatever Xiangau&#146;s art was, it was clearly ancient, and therefore more 
practiced. There were cracks in the Asagawa style, which her father had 
sought to fill, but had not accomplished just yet. With that in mind, 
Xiangau was already at an advantage against Yoko. And there was very 
little she could do about that 

&#145;I have to come up with a strategy for beating him.&#146; Yoko thought 
privately.  &#145;If I end up facing him in the tournament, I&#146;ll probably 
need&#133;huh?&#146; 

Yoko&#146;s train of thought was cut short. By a flash of a woman. A woman 
that had run passed the door the minute Yoko&#146;s eyes crossed that area. 
Just like at the port. Was it&#133; Li Ming? Again? Could it really be her? 
Before, she had dismissed the idea of Li Ming being at this tournament 
After all, the way she left before, why would she even be here? But no 
matter what the reason, Yoko had to know if it was really her. If it was 
Li Ming, there was absolutely no way she could allow the situation to 
rest. The black-haired girl nodded to Xiangau as a sort of &#145;excuse me, 
but I have to go&#146;.  He didn&#146;t seem to care much, all he offered in 
response was a grunt, but that was enough for Yoko. She dashed from the 
punching bag she was standing in front of and ran to the door leading 
out of the gym. This gym was one of the few that was built into the 
complex that fighters stayed in during their time here, so Yoko knew 
that the person was a competitor in the tournament. Yoko exited the gym 
into a furnished corridor,  following that woman. She quickly strolled 
down the pathway of the corridor, so did Yoko. She turned a corner and 
exited through the left, so did Yoko. 

By the time Yoko went through that door, the chase had ended. She had 
been brought to one of the areas of the complex that really brought out 
the beauty of Kakuri Isle. By size it was quite a few miles wide, and 
held many natural jungle-like fauna that botanists would have greatly 
appreciated. This section of the complex was a reflection of the outside 
of Kakuri. It was a sort of oversized veranda filled with the rich and 
lush plants that were littering Kakuri Isle&#146;s forests. It was filled 
with idle fireflies that lit the path for Yoko, and the gentle chirp of 
crickets, helped add to the charming nature of the setting. This veranda 
was also overhanging the sea, as the complex was at the edge of a cliff 
face hung above the small beach that the Grand Soma was resting against.

Yoko looked up to the edge of the veranda, to the banister. The girl was 
waiting there, her back to railing and her hands holding onto it, her 
long hair (tied into thick braids) flashed around by the sternness of 
the eastern wind that was picking up. The girl spoke.

&#147;I just wanted to see your face again.&#148;

There was no denying it now. &#147;Li Ming&#133; it really is you&#133;&#148;

&#147;Why did you follow me here?&#148; She replied. 

Yoko was thrown. Halfway between happiness and complete surprise, she 
was expecting Li Ming to join her in celebration. But she somehow seemed 
angry. And a little different&#133; 

The Asagawa-girl blinked. &#147;B-Because I wanted to know if it was really 
you. I-I wanted to see you.&#148;

&#147;Yoko&#133;&#148; Li Ming lowered her gaze to the ground, trying hard to avoid eye 
contact. &#147;Things aren&#146;t as they were last year. Things have changed.&#148;

&#147;What things?&#148;

Li Ming breathed in slowly. &#147;I want you to go home.&#148;

&#147;What are you talking about?&#148; Yoko questioned. Soon new questions began 
to emerge. &#147;After all this time, is that all you have to say to me?! 
Don&#146;t you think I deserve an explanation about why you left like you 
did?! Everyone else was worried sick about you!&#148;

Li Ming still didn&#146;t look at her. &#147;They shouldn&#146;t have been.&#148; 

&#147;Why not? They were your friends! They cared about you!&#148; Yoko yelled. 

&#147;They didn&#146;t need to, because,&#148; Li Ming breathed icily. &#147;I have no 
friends.&#148;

Yoko didn&#146;t take that lying down. &#147;I&#146;m your friend!&#148;

That put a dent in Li Ming&#146;s hostility. The Chinese woman became silent 
again. It appeared that she hadn&#146;t really thought about what she was 
going to say to Yoko, and truth be told, neither had Yoko herself. But 
then, Yoko was still in shock that this was Li Ming that she was 
actually talking to. Yoko searched the girl&#146;s eyes. There was something 
about her that was different than it was from last year. It was like Li 
Ming was carrying some great weight, some horrible secret that was 
binding her. But, if that were true, what would it be? What knowledge 
would make her abandon her friends the way she did?

Yoko was far more direct with her questions this time. &#147;What did he say 
to you?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Your Uncle,&#148; Yoko said sternly. &#147;He came to visit the Asagawa Training 
Hall the day before you left. What did he say to you? What did he tell 
you that was so bad it forced you to leave the group?&#148;

Li Ming&#146;s eyes were equally stern. &#147;You can&#146;t get involved in this, 
Yoko.&#148;

&#147;Why not? I just want to know-&#148;

&#147;You can&#146;t get involved!&#148; 

That silenced the conversation once again. Yoko was shocked at the 
outburst. Li Ming had changed so much. Before, she was such a caring 
person, even if a little moody. Now she was so hostile and quiet. What 
was this secret Li Ming was harbouring? Why did it make her change so 
much?

Yoko felt tears stinging her eyes. To think, she could taking beating 
after beating from hardcore martial artists, but the one thing that 
could make her cry, would be this Being yelled at by Li Ming. But after 
all, they were supposed to be friends&#133;

Yoko pasted a fake smile on her lips. &#147;I-I&#146;m sorry I bothered you. I&#146;ll 
leave you alone now.&#148;

The young woman turned her back and left. Through the door, back into 
the confines of the complex. Li Ming on the other hand, turned around so 
that she faced the balustrade She lowered her head, and a tear slipped 
down her own eye. It had been nearly a year since she and Yoko had last 
seen each other, and yet&#133;

After all this time&#133; &#147;Why do I still&#133;?&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

West Beach, Kakuri Isle, Pacific Ocean

Miss Keiko sighed. Even the chillingly beautiful moonlight splashing off 
the waves of the sea could cool her down. She really wasn&#146;t the type to 
get flustered, but the delivery that should have been sent here two days 
ago was just arriving now. Miss Keiko took the pen from behind her ear, 
and wrote a few notes down on her schedule. While she did this, the 
small ship pulled up against the shore of Kakuri Isle&#146;s west beach 
opened up. The iron door broke open, then crashed into the sand of the 
beach. Seconds later, a group of burly men came through it, carrying a 
large box between the three of them. With the box in their hands, they 
walked towards Miss Keiko and the KAIGA Group lackeys that were standing 
behind her. 

Once they reached the woman, they slowly placed the box down into the 
sand in front of her Miss Keiko finished jotting down her notes, then 
looked up at the deliverers. Though they were dressed in typical KAIGA 
Group uniform, from the way Miss Keiko was looking at them you would 
have thought they were the enemy.

&#147;You took your sweet time,&#148; She said, frustrated. &#147;The tournament starts 
tomorrow. Just eight hours from now. Do you realize what would have 
happened if the Stone Egg had not been delivered here by that time?&#148;

&#147;Uh&#133; no&#133;&#148; One of the couriers replied absently. 

Miss Keiko sighed at the brain-dead hired muscle. &#147;Mr. Schwarzluft would 
have had your heads on his wall. And probably mine too. In future, when 
we ask for your services we expect you to be on time.&#148;

Another of the couriers piped up. &#147;Look lady, we got that thing here, 
didn&#146;t we? Who cares if we&#146;re a little late As long as we did what was 
asked, what more do you need?&#148;

&#147;Assurance,&#148; Miss Keiko said. &#147;Your lateness has displeased both me and 
Mr. Schwarzluft. But I think we&#146;ll just dock it out of your salary to 
even our score.&#148;

&#147;What!?&#148; One of the three large deliverers bellowed, glaring hatefully 
at Miss Keiko. He scowled at her, as if a threat to say &#145;I better get 
the money in full&#146; but when he observed that cool retorting look in the 
secretary&#146;s eyes, he knew that she was serious. In his fury, he grabbed 
the woman by the collar, hoisting her up into the air. Some of the them 
behind her shuffled to attack, but Miss Keiko put them at ease with a 
staying hand.

&#147;We want our money! In full!&#148; The brute yelled.
 
Miss Keiko frowned at him. &#147;And what exactly will you do, if you don&#146;t 
get it in full?&#148;

There was little he could do to answer that. But their was a lot that 
Miss Keiko could do to answer the question for him. The young woman 
dropped her clipboard to the sand of the ground. The grunt was about to 
question that, till he felt the woman&#146;s elbow rammed into his gut. He 
gasped, mouth and eyes both wide, and involuntarily released Miss 
Keiko&#146;s collar. Her heels clicked with the sand,  but her attack wasn&#146;t 
finished. She grabbed the taller man by the arm, swung her body around, 
and pulled downwards. The winded thug wheezed for breath and was drawn 
over Miss Keiko&#146;s smaller form. He was swung around in a 180-degree 
motion, and crashed into the sand in front of the woman. 

All who were around, including the people working for Miss Keiko, gasped 
at the feat they had just seen. But the young woman, cool and collected 
as she was, ignored this, just as she ignored the pained groans of the 
downed grunt. She kneeled to the ground, picked up her clipboard, then 
turned to address the other deliverers. 

&#147;Is there anything else?&#148; She said, adjusting her glasses. &#147;Or would you 
rather leave while you still have some money to enjoy.&#148;

The two other guys nodded violently, and grabbed their co-worker. Miss 
Keiko ignored them and looked over at the boys behind her. &#147;Okay. We 
need the Stone Egg moved to in the inside of the Kakuri Isle complex. We 
shall move it to the Stone Ruins when the time for the final round has 
come.&#148;

Those men nodded, then went for the box that contained the Stone Egg. 
While they lifted it up to their shoulders and began marching toward the 
trail leading up to the complex, Miss Keiko remained there, and walked 
down the long stretch of the beach. The God of Fighting Grand 
Championships were finally beginning.
