A Bundle of Sadness

The breakfast bell rung throughout through the halls of the Whispering 
Hills Eastern Dorm and hungry crowd of girls, many still clad in pyjamas 
and nightgowns, began to fill the halls. One girl among them walked 
against the flow of girls, her short, dark brown hair bouncing with each 
step, a pair of black plastic barrettes held the left side of her hair 
from falling into her eyes, as she ascended the dorm stairs, carefully 
weaving her way through the crowd. She watched each girl, in search of 
someone that she already knew would not be among them. It didn&#39;t take 
long for the halls to clear, leaving her standing alone. With a sigh of 
disappointment, she continued to climb the stairs to the third floor 
where she found the halls were quiet apart from the occasional straggler 
breaking the silence while chatting with a friend or two about the day&#39;s 
events.  

&quot;Hey Cherilyn,&quot; A passer-by calls out to the girl, &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to 
eat?&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; She replied apprehensively, &quot;Have you seen Tanya around?&quot; 
Cherilyn asked, gazing down the hall. She already knew what the answer 
would be, but she held a slight hope that she would be mistaken. 

Long faced, the group of girls glanced down the hall and one of them 
turned back to Cherilyn, &quot;She still hasn&#39;t come out of her room.&quot; She 
replied with a note of concern in her voice. Tanya had not been out of 
her room in a long time, and everyone in the east wing was beginning to 
worry. 

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Cherilyn said, trying to force herself to smile at the girls, 
but only managing to get the corner of her mouth to twitch slightly.  
The girls mirrored her uncomfortable smile before continuing along their 
way to the cafeteria. Cherilyn watched until the girls disappeared down 
the stairwell, only when they were gone did she scan up and down the 
hall to see if anyone else was still lingering. When she was certain 
that the floor was empty she march down the hall, this time with more 
urgency then before and stopped at the door marked E212 at the far end 
of the hall, where she proceeded to knock. 

At first there was no response and Cherilyn was about to knock again 
when she heard a tired voice speak, almost in a whisper, &quot;I don&#39;t want 
to eat... thanks.&quot; 

Cherilyn felt her fists clench, just hearing the pain in her friend&#39;s 
voice was like knives in her heart. She closed her eyes and took a deep 
breath before reaching out to open the door, &quot;Tanya, it&#39;s me...&quot; She 
said as she entered the room. 

A gloomy feeling permeated the room; the firmly drawn curtains didn&#39;t 
help matters. Two beds, each set against either wall, took up a large 
portion of the tiny room. A pair of desks faced the walls between the 
heads of each bed and the far wall, which comprised of one large window 
that started about waist height and reached to the ceiling, with a small 
nock for someone to sit upon when they wished. Two Wardrobes took up the 
ends of the beds and filled the last of the room, leaving only a small 
amount of space to move around. The left hand side of the room was neat 
and obviously had not been used in some time while the other bed&#39;s 
covers were rumpled into a tight ball, and a small bit of light brown 
hair could be seen poking out of the side. The blankets began to shift, 
and a teenaged girl in baggy blue pyjamas covered in cat paw prints 
emerged like a butterfly from a cocoon. Her shoulder length hair was a 
tangled mess, and there were dark circles under her bloodshot eyes, 
showing that she had been crying for days. She blinked several times and 
glanced around the room, wavering back and forth where she sat, almost 
as if she was unaware of her surroundings. 

&quot;You weren&#39;t in class again yesterday.&quot; Cherilyn noted to the girl, 
while sitting down gently on the corner of the bed.

&quot;I was tired...&quot; Tanya said softly, unable to look at her friend. 

&quot;You look more like you&#39;re dead.&quot; Cherilyn stated. She tried hard to 
laugh, but the look of despair on Tanya&#39;s face made her laughter die 
before it escaped her lips, &quot;Are you ever going to come back to school?&quot; 
She asked while she leaned back to stare at the ceiling, planting her 
hands on either side to support herself. 

&quot;What&#39;s the use?&quot; Tanya flopped back down on the bed and closed her 
eyes. 

Cherilyn turned her head to glance at her friend, wishing there was 
something she could say, or do, to help relieve her of some of the 
sorrow she was feeling. She shifted her hand and felt something hard 
under the blankets. Reaching underneath the covers, Cherilyn found a 
small picture frame, which held a year old photo showing Jenn and Kris 
happily holding each other, smiling cheerfully at the camera. Cherilyn 
glanced up from the photo to gaze upon the empty bed across the room, 
where not long ago she used to see Jenn curled up asleep. 

&#39;How long had it been? Weeks? Months?&#39; Cherilyn had lost track of the 
time, but ever since that day... &#39;Oh sweet Jennifer.&#39; Cherilyn thought 
to herself while tracing a finger along the outline of the photo. Jenn 
was not like any of the other East Wingers. She always stood tall and 
proud, as if the fact that she lived in an orphanage of sorts didn&#39;t 
bother her nonetheless. She had a strength to her that was felt by all 
those around her. It was no wonder that so many secretly crushed for the 
girl. While May&#39;s passing only made a slight ripple among the school 
dwellers, Jenn&#39;s near death spread through out the school like a tidal 
wave. It was like a sullen shadow fell over the school, and one by one 
everyone was being affected by it. No one felt it more than Tanya, who 
was not only one of Jenn&#39;s closest friends, but Cherilyn was certain 
that at one time Tanya had feelings for Jennifer, just as Cherilyn was 
feeling for Tanya at that moment. No one really knew how much pain Jenn 
must have been hiding behind that warming smile of her&#39;s. Or how many 
sleepless nights the girl must have endured before running cold steel 
across her wrists. 

Cherilyn&#39;s eyes dropped to her own hands.  Her parents had been swiftly 
taken from her whilst she was away at school. She had arrived at home 
only to discover their lifeless bodies lying on the living room floor. 
Her mind simply shut down at that time. Soon after she was sent to 
Whispering Hills and was told that many of the girls have also survived 
horrifying events. On more than one occasion had she considered dying, 
however, the close bonds she found to the many friends she made at the 
school kept her alive and, to some extent, even sane. She could not 
fathom what could have happened to Jenn. The girl was known to keep 
quiet on those details. Not really on purpose. It was like the girl 
could not remember and Cherilyn could understand that, however the death 
of May must have been too much for Jenn&#39;s mind to handle and finally 
pushed the girl over the edge. 

&quot;It&#39;s not fair.&quot; Tanya said her voice muffled by the pillow she clenched 
close to her head, &quot;We should all be eating together like always. It&#39;s 
just not fair.&quot; Tears soaked the pillowcase as she buried her face 
deeper into the pillow and let out an intense sob. 

Gingerly Cherilyn placed one of her arms over Tanya&#39;s legs and softly 
set her head on the girl&#39;s lap, &quot;I know... I know...&quot; She could not 
think of anything to say that would soothe her friend, and watching 
Tanya like this was squeezing on her heart more and more as the days 
passed by, &quot;I wish I could take the pain away.&quot; She mumbled. 

&quot;I just want everything to be the way it was.&quot; Tanya pulled the pillow 
off her head, leaving her eyes covered by her arm, &quot;May, Jenn and 
Kris... &quot; She sniffled. 

Cherilyn pulled herself closer to Tanya until she was looking down at 
the girl. She turned the girl over and pulled her arm away from her eyes 
so that she could look into them. For the first time Tanya truly noticed 
Cherilyn. A small tear welled up in the corner of Cherilyn&#39;s eye, &quot;I 
hate seeing you like this.&quot; She set her head on Tanya&#39;s shoulder. 

Setting her hands on Cherilyn&#39;s cheek Tanya spoke in but a whisper, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry...&quot; Tanya didn&#39;t realize until now just how much her friend was 
hurting. Every day Cherilyn would visit her and watch over her while she 
slept, only leaving to go to classes or get something to eat. More than 
once Cherilyn had snuck a snack into Tanya&#39;s room, just to make sure the 
girl ate something, but until now Tanya was too blinded by her own 
misery to notice. The two girls lay listening to each other&#39;s breathing, 
neither knowing what to say to the other. 

Abruptly the intercom crackled to life, &quot;Vitt... Tanya Vitt, telephone 
for you... Telephone for Tanya Vitt.&quot; The intercom shut off. 

Cherilyn sat up, &quot;Do you want me to get that for you?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;No, that is alright.&quot; Tanya unravelled herself from the blankets and 
dropped her feet into her slippers before standing. She glanced over at 
her friend, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back, alright?&quot; She grabbed a robe off the 
desk chair and threw it over her shoulders. 

&quot;Sure thing,&quot; Cherilyn rolled over on the bed and watched Tanya groggily 
shuffle out the door, leaving Cherilyn alone once again. 

After a few moments, Cherilyn got to her feet and pulled the curtains 
open, flooding the room with the new morning&#39;s light. She then opened 
the window to let in some fresh air. She took a deep breath, feeling the 
cool autumn air fill her lungs and let it out. Some birds chirped in a 
nearby tree that a few girls sat in the shade of while eating. Off to 
her left the school could be seen stretching into the distance. The 
academy itself is a monolithic structure. The central wing itself is 
something to behold. Stone steps lead up to a set of massive wooden 
doors that greet the students as they enter the school. A long row of 
windows, which belong to the head mistress&#39; office, can be seen 
overlooking the front schoolyards, and above that sits the school&#39;s 
extensive library. The auditorium occupied the rest of the wing. While 
the east wing looked like any other modern day school with its clean 
grey brink walls and lines of steel framed windows running the entire 
length of all five floors, the west wing had a style that was almost 
Victorian. The walls were made of a red brick, which looked like they 
had seen one to many days in the sun.  Long branches of ivy spread 
across much of that side of the building framing wooden windows with old 
shutters that lined the walls of each of the seven floors, giving the 
wing an eerie and haunted look to it. Both dorms reflected the 
uniqueness of their respective wing of the school. At the far end of the 
school grounds the Western Dorm could bee seen looming on the horizon. 
Even from this distance the wing held a creepy quality to it, and made 
Cherilyn shudder. 

No one knew, or even understood, why the school was divided in such a 
way. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to why some of the girls were 
chosen to live in such a desolate place as the West Wing. Many East 
Wingers protested when they got their move notice, however once they 
were settled they seemed quite happy with the idea. It sometimes made 
Cherilyn curious as to what exactly went on in that end of the school 
and yet no one would talk about it to the East Wingers. It was not like 
they were rude about it or anything. They just didn&#39;t seem like they 
wanted to talk much about why that wing existed. Cherilyn felt she 
grasped, to some extent, the reason for the West Wingers. There was 
something about those girls that was so much different then all the 
others. She was almost certain that it was something within their eyes, 
almost as if some kind of gloom was trying to eat at their very souls. 
As if their suffering was much more than anyone in the East Wing could 
ever comprehend. 
					
 She was glad she didn&#39;t end up as one of the West Wingers, because she 
was not sure she would be able to live in that old building. Secretly 
Cherilyn feared the day she too would be called to that hideous wing. 
She dreaded that her mere feelings for Tanya would damn her to that 
decaying place. It was well known that many of the girls of the West 
Wing felt the pleasures of softer flesh. Yet of the East Wingers there 
were so very few that Cherilyn could count them on her hands and with 
Jenn and Kris&#39;s disappearance that number had greatly diminished.   

Her eyes drifted across the landscape to fall upon the black trees of 
the Western Woods that surrounded most of the west side of the grounds. 
It looked as if the woods would swallow the entire West Wing dorms in 
any given minute. Its dark, dense brush stifled all light that tried to 
enter its boundaries. On the brightest of days the forest only seemed to 
get that much more dismal. The students were warned of the woods the 
moment they set foot on the grounds. It was a forbidden place and 
Cherilyn didn&#39;t have to be told twice to stay clear of that area. To 
her, it felt like the woods itself were alive and she was almost certain 
that the forest had actually grown larger in the past few months, 
growing in strength. The longer she stared at it, the more she became 
convinced that the woods were pulsating and that the gnarled branches of 
the trees were reaching out towards her, wanting to pull her in and eat 
her alive. She quickly turning away so she didn&#39;t have to look at the 
thing any longer, only to find Tanya standing in the middle of the room, 
staring at the photo with tears in her eyes. She glanced up at Cherilyn 
while wiping at her eyes with the sleeve of her pyjamas. 

Cherilyn broke away from the window and pulled the girl into her arms, 
&quot;Shhhh... It is all right... Just let it out.&quot; She whispered softly, 
while stroking the back of the girl&#39;s head. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Tanya said between sobs, &quot;I&#39;m just so happy.&quot;

&quot;Happy?!?&quot; Cherilyn stepped back so she could look the girl in the eyes, 
&quot;Huh???&quot; She was clearly confused. 

&quot;They&#39;re back.&quot; Tanya said with a smile, holding the picture frame up, 
&quot;Their finally back.&quot; There was a shimmer in the girl&#39;s eyes as if 
something breathed life back into them and she wrapped her arms around 
Cherilyn&#39;s neck. Cherilyn standing stiff as her mind pinwheeled around 
what she was hearing. Could it really be true? Jenn and Kris had 
returned? Her mind struggled with this thought as she stared down at 
Tanya&#146;s head as she nuzzled into her shoulder. She had to force her arms 
to encircle the girl and return the hug for in her heart she felt 
something worrisome about their friends sudden return, but did not wish 
to ruin her friend&#146;s new found will to live so kept her worries to 
herself and just enjoyed the hug.
