High above the earth&#146;s atmosphere, among the stars and space, the dark 
general Tanzanite waits in the in-junction of matter, the Negative 
dimension.

&#147;What is taking him so long?&#148;

Tanzanite thought to himself as he stalked up and down the ivory halls 
of the negative dimension. Cross-armed and eyes closed, the Dark 
general was becoming more and more angry. Ever since Garnet&#146;s first 
little&#133;&#146;visit&#146;, she had been putting immense amounts of pressure on 
him to find the Talismans in time for the Lunatic Andromeda. He knew 
that there was not a lot of time, before the sacred event started, 
considering that the attack plan had not been formulated and a large 
supply of human energy was still needed. Not only that, but 
apparently, the Queen had become very anxious over finding them 
(according to Garnet&#146;s words). 

&#147; If I don&#146;t act soon&#133; Asumasa will kill me. I have got to get the 
other three talismans soon or I will die. This wouldn&#146;t be so hard if 
I didn&#146;t have Garnet breathing down my neck&#133;blast you, you witch. I&#146;ll 
get you for this.&#148; 

&#147;Where are you Wong-Lao! Bring me those talismans!!!&#148;

Tanzanite turned abruptly as heard the far pine doors on the other end 
of the hall slowly open. A familiar face made itself known as the 
figure stepped up, the doors closing behind him. 

He was a tall man, in human form, and possessed long feint gray hair. 
The clothes he was wearing were pure white, flashing streaks of 
electric blue over the shoulders. The trench coat was long, with a 
picture of a Chinese dragon on it&#146;s back. He also wore a pair of gold 
braces slightly below the middle length sleeve of the trench coat. His 
red eyes gleamed with annoyance as he stared at Tanzanite. Tanzanite 
himself stared back, and then a sneaky smile crossed his face.

&#147;Ah Wong-Lao. You have returned in human form&#133;I assume you have all 
the other talismans to give to me.&#148;

&#147;Wrong assumption.&#148;

Wong-Lao raised his hand and threw out a piece of some ancient 
artifact, silver and shining, the shape of a quarter-circle. Tanzanite 
caught it, then took a quick look at it, and looked back at Wong-Lao. 
Angrily. 

&#147;&#133;One talisman&#133;? I told you to bring all of them to me!&#148;

&#147;If you think it&#146;s that easy to find one of these things then get of 
your ass and find them yourself.&#148;

&#147;How dare you! If you think I&#146;m going to continue paying you for 
second-rate jobs then you&#146;re out of your mind! Now get back down to 
earth and find the other two!&#148;

&#147;You fool. Whenever there is a trace of the talismans those miserable 
star soldiers make themselves known. It was only by luck that they 
didn&#146;t find this one. They are much more powerful than we thought 
Tanzanite. They need to be obliterated and I will not take on that 
kind of task. Not with three of them on the loose.&#148;

&#147;So you&#146;re saying you need the starsoldiers out of your hair to find 
the rest of the talismans?&#148;

&#147;Correct.&#148;

&#147;Well I should have known better than to ask you to kill them as well. 
All right I&#146;ll take care of it. Those starsoldiers wont know what hit 
them.&#148;

&#147;How?&#148;

&#147;Ha. Don&#146;t worry. I have more than a few warriors here in the negative 
dimension. Once I have the starsoldiers out of my way, the talismans 
will be mine.&#148;

Tanzanite smirked and put a hand behind his back and pulled out a 
card, with some strange symbols written on it. He threw it into the 
air, and as it reached mid-flight, it stopped. Tanzanite placed his 
hands together and spouted a dark chant, mumbling words from a 
completely different language. As he spoke, the card started to emit 
light, and split into three other cards. Wong-Lao watched on as 
Tanzanite called forth three demon-monsters. 

&#147;Three demons at once&#133;the dark force is serious.&#148;

**********

Meanwhile back on earth, Yai was going crazy over what to do next. It 
had been three days since she realized she was in love with Keiya, and 
she had spoken to Alana about it. She was okay with this, to Yai&#146;s 
great relief, but she also raised the point of Akira. He had to know. 
Whether Keiya returned her feelings or not, he had a right to know. 
And now she was sitting on her couch in her house, working up the 
courage to call him. It was just so hard. Yai never liked hurting 
people, and this was no different. Akira really was the perfect 
boyfriend, but just not what she was looking for. She was in love with 
Keiya. Very much so.  Nervously, Yai picked up the receiver of the 
phone, and slowly tapped in Akira&#146;s number.

&#147;Okay this is it. I&#146;m so sorry Akira&#133;&#148; Yai thought as she held the 
phone to her ear and heard the ring tone. 

&#147;Come on&#133;&#148;

(Ring)

&#147;Please be home&#133;&#148;

(Ring)

&#147;Please? &#133;I don&#146;t think I have the strength to do this again&#133;&#148;

&#147;Hello?&#148; It was Akira.

&#147;Akira?&#148;

&#147;Oh hey Yai. I was going to call you later on. We haven&#146;t talked in a 
while.&#148;

&#147;Yes well&#133;we need to talk Akira. Can you please meet me at that 
foreign restaurant on 23rd street?&#148;

&#147;Yeah&#133;sure Yai&#133;are you okay&#133;you don&#146;t sound too well&#133;&#148;

&#147;No I&#146;m fine. Please just meet me there tomorrow night okay? 8.00 
don&#146;t be late. Bye.&#148; Click.

Akira sat down as he put the phone back on the receiver deck. Yai 
seemed so worried. He knew something was wrong. 

&#147;She never was a good liar&#133;I know something is up.&#148;

**********

7.51, Chez Paris (French restaurant)

Yai waited in front of the busy French restaurant at which, Yai told 
Akira to meet her. It was probably a bad idea to tell him over dinner 
but she couldn&#146;t do it at home, and she didn&#146;t feel like telling him 
this at his apartment. This was one of the hardest things Yai had ever 
had to do. She always thought Akira was perfect for her. Even other 
people thought they were perfect for each other, even though he was 
about three years older than she was. She had romantic dreams of the 
two of them getting married, and moving into the countryside, with two 
kids and a dog, just living out the rest of their lives together in 
each other&#146;s arms. But that all changed the day Keiya arrived onto the 
scene&#133;

&#147;I wonder where he is. It&#146;s 7.52.&#148;

Then suddenly, Yai saw a crimson red car pull up in the car park in 
front of the road. This was it Yai thought to herself. Yai greeted 
Akira as he stepped out of his car. Yai squirmed internally as she saw 
the worried look Akira had on his face. She could see that she wasn&#146;t 
the only one who realized they had problems. The two met in front of 
the restaurant and Yai led him in. They sat down at the table that the 
waiter had led them to. They were both uneasy, Akira seemed anxious 
and Yai couldn&#146;t bring herself to look at Akira. She didn&#146;t feel like 
she could wait until the end of dinner to tell him so she decided to 
tell him now. Akira got a little worried at the sudden silence, and 
tried to break the ice.

&#147;So&#133;Yai. You&#133;wanna order?&#148;

&#147;Later&#133;I really need to talk Akira.&#148;

&#147;I kind of figured that out from the way you&#146;ve been acting recently.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m&#133;sorry.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s okay, just tell me what&#146;s wrong.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Fine. How long have we been going out Akira? It&#146;s been quite a while 
now hasn&#146;t it?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, about 6 months now.&#148;

&#147;And through that time, we have become so close haven&#146;t we? I felt 
like I could tell you any thing. But now&#133;that closeness has 
changed&#133;you know?&#148;

Akira nodded. He knew this all to well. Yai had become so&#133;distant. 
Like some thing was pulling her away from him&#133;but what?

&#147;I can&#146;t help but feel responsible for this Akira.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not arguing with you. But I guess it&#146;s my fault too.&#148;

&#147;No Akira&#133;that&#146;s just not true. It&#146;s me. I know that. You know that. 
And I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Is that what you called me here for? To apologize?&#148;

Yai turns her hand away in shame. This was hard for her.

&#147;No Akira. There is something else.&#148; Or *someone* else.

&#147;What is it, Yai? Please tell me. I think I have a right to know.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re right. You do. I&#133;I&#146;m&#133;I&#146;m sorry,  Akira but&#133;I think we should 
stop seeing each other&#133;&#148;

&#147;What!?&#148;

Akira had been completely taken off-guard by this. He knew things had 
been a little shaky between them but a break-up? As he saw people from 
neighbouring tables look at him, he calmed down and controlled his 
voice a little. 

&#147;What do you mean&#133;stop seeing each other?&#148;

&#147;I am so sorry, Akira&#133;but I just don&#146;t think it&#146;s what it used to be. 
You know I care deeply for you&#133;but I just don&#146;t feel the same way as I 
did before. I think we should split up because it&#146;s not fair on you. I 
know it seems hard right now but if you look into your heart you&#146;ll 
know it&#146;s for the best.&#148;

Akira looked stunned at first, and took a few seconds to gather his 
thoughts. After a while he let out a sad smile, and looked at Yai.

&#147;I guess it&#146;s over then.&#148;

&#147;I&#133;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s okay Yai. I understand. It couldn&#146;t last forever I guess. I just 
hope&#133;we can stay friends then?&#148;

&#147;Definitely, Akira. I would love that.&#148;

It was hard but the two managed to talk things out. Akira and Yai were 
a little more than shaken, but were strong for the other. They managed 
to talk about the old days and past times. It was hard for both of 
them to let go, but in some twisted way, they knew it was for the 
best.  An hour later, Akira decided to leave. He offered Yai a ride 
home but she refused, and said she wanted to stay a little longer. The 
two said goodbye. They said they would keep in touch, but both of them 
knew, that this would probably the last time they talked together. 
Akira then left. Yai didn&#146;t feel like going home to get another grill 
session from her dad about &#145;how the date went&#146;, &#145;what did the two of 
you do?&#146; and &#145;did that young punk try anything?&#146; She sighed as she 
thought about her dad going on another tirade about Akira. Then 
suddenly, she heard a scream from the table across from her. 

&#147;Aaaahhhhhh! What the hell is that?&#148;

Yai&#146;s gaze turned to the window at which the distraught old woman was 
pointing to. She saw three figures, covered in shadow, their eyes 
gleaming with a dark crimson.

&#147;Oh dammit&#133;the dark force&#133;why now?&#148;

Yai stood immediately, preparing to transform, when suddenly she 
remembered something. 

&#147;Damn! I can&#146;t transform in front of these people. Keiya and Alana 
told me never to do that. So how can I&#133;wait&#133;I think I have an idea&#133;my 
mother always told me never to lie but&#133;&#148;  

&#147;Fire!!! Fire!!! Everybody get out! Run! FIRE!!!&#148;

As Yai yelled, people stood in fear and fled for their lives through 
the fire door. It was a cruel trick but hey, would they rather be 
dead? As soon as she saw everyone leave and checked for anybody else, 
she began to transform. 

&#147;Lovestar power&#133;transform!&#148;

In a flash of light, Yai Kitana transformed into Lovestar, goddess of 
love and peace. She ran to the back room and exited the restaurant. 
Darting to the window where the three demon-monsters were, she was 
surprised when she saw they were gone. But she turned around quickly 
when she heard footsteps&#133;

&#147;Well, well, well, if it isn&#146;t the infamous Lovestar. I say we tear 
this kid apart. What do you say, Poison, Virus?&#148;

&#147;Yeah, lets infect this little brat!&#148;

Lovestar turned round to the three in anger.

&#147;What did you call me?&#148;

Lovestar stepped back a little, as the taller one in the middle moved 
forward. He introduced himself as Plague, and the others as Poison and 
Virus. He laughed a little when he saw how puny Lovestar was compared 
to him, and made a decision. 

&#147;I think three against one is a little unfair, especially for a puny 
little gnat like you. So how about a little one on one there brat?&#148;

&#147;Fine&#133;Come on!&#148;

Lovestar readied herself as plague approached her. This was a lucky 
break for her; she doubted the idea of defeating them all at once. 
Picking them off one by one was the best choice, but she was hoping 
the others would find a way to reach her in time. But now&#133;she would 
have fight on her own. Lovestar took on a defensive status, and 
prepared to take on plague, which was simply walking up to her. Then, 
in a fit of passion, Plague screamed at Lovestar and lunged at her. 
The chestnut haired warrior was caught off-guard by this, and Plague 
managed to punch her hard in the stomach. She reeled back, but quickly 
recovered and swung her leg at him, but he blocked the hit with his 
right arm. As he blocked the blow he dropped to the ground with pure 
stealth and swept at the Goddess of love and peace&#146;s feet in a swift 
motion. As she fell forward, Plague quickly rose to his feet and 
kicked her violently on the chin. Plague then tried to punch her, but 
this time she was quick enough to dodge, and leapt into the air. She 
landed about five metres away from Plague, and as she did, she wiped 
the blood of her brow. Plague smiled at this, and then charged at her. 
He tried to punch her repeatedly, but Lovestar managed to stay one 
step ahead of each of him, narrowly escaping each blow. Eventually, 
she was backed onto a wall, and Lovestar cartwheeled to her left to 
avoid the final punch from Plague, which cracked the wall on impact. 
Lovestar ran forward a little, and elevated herself. She span quickly 
in the air, and attempted to kick Plague, but was stopped when Plague 
blocked her attack with one arm and used the other to strike her in 
the chest. Lovestar&#146;s eyes went wide with shock and fell to the 
ground. Plague stood over and laughed mockingly, and added to his 
enjoyment by repeatedly kicking at her stomach. With one final kick, 
Lovestar was thrown across the ground onto her side. 

&#147;This the best you got star girl?&#148; Plague said amused

Still staring at him, Lovestar struggled to her feet, one hand 
clutching her ribs and the other propping her up. As she stared 
blankly at Plague, she secretly studied him. 

&#147;At first glance he seems to have no real physical attributes that 
would give him an edge over me&#133;so how is he able to block all of my 
moves&#133;it&#146;s like he knows my actions before I make them&#133;if physical 
attacks wont work I&#146;ll guess I&#146;ll have to use energy. But I cant use 
it on this road&#133;it might alert people to my presence&#133;alright you&#133;I&#146;ll 
end this.&#148;

Lovestar stood once again wiping her brow. She took a quick look at 
the blood that stained her glove and clenched her fists.

&#147;Follow Me!&#148;

Lovestar yelled out and then leapt into the distance. Plague looked 
stunned and turned back to Poison and Virus. Poison stepped forward in 
anger.

&#147;Let&#146;s follow her. She&#146;s probably trying to buy time, the coward. 
Let&#146;s go.&#148;

The three then quickly teleported out of the scene. Lovestar began 
dashing between buildings and back streets, trying to find the nearest 
clearing with a fair bit of cover. She searched profusely but she 
couldn&#146;t find anywhere. However as she turned a street, she saw an old 
abandoned warehouse on the edge of the road. After checking for any 
people, she broke the lock and went inside. She caught her breath and 
looked the place over. Fairly big with lots of old machinery and 
crates. 

&#147;This may not provide the best surroundings for a fight but at least I 
don&#146;t have to worry about people seeing me and getting hurt.&#148;

&#147;Hey there Brat!&#148;

Lovestar turned around in shock to find they were here already. All 
three of them were standing by a pile of crates. Plague stepped 
forward again. Lovestar felt a pang of worry settle in her stomach 
when she faced the realization of the fact that she may not be a match 
for Plague and certainly not for all three. 

&#147;What&#146;s wrong kid? Scared? Oh don&#146;t worry&#133;I&#146;ll end this game here and 
now&#133;&#148;

Plague raised his fist and yelled out &#145;Finish Ray!&#146; The beam of red 
light headed straight for Lovestar. Panic-stricken, Lovestar&#146;s body 
filled with strength and in a burst of adrenalin, Lovestar side-rolled 
out of the way and fired an attack of her own.

&#147;Crushing Love Blast!&#148;

A wave of golden energy hit Plague with a mighty impact, causing a 
blinding explosion; smoke filled the hall of the warehouse as the 
blast cracked the foundation of the floor. Poison and Virus looked on, 
surprised but still sneakily calm. Panting heavily, Lovestar lowered 
her wrists and stood, carefully walking towards the smoke filled hole 
that the blast created. Then, she stepped in back terror, after seeing 
Plague climbing out of the hole, near enough unaffected. Plague smiled 
as he stood up, clothes charred and remainders of smoke clinging to 
his body. 

&#147;It&#146;s&#133;not possible&#133;&#148;

Plague laughed raised his hand again, to fire another finish ray at 
the now shocked Lovestar. 

&#147;I hope that&#146;s not your best brat.&#148;

As Plague began to gather energy for his attack, a thin piercing beam 
of golden energy shot at his hand. Startled at this, Lovestar, Plague, 
Virus and Poison turned to the pile of crates where the blast came 
from. When they looked there, they found two other Starsoldiers. 
Lovestar&#146;s face brightened with joy as she saw her partners.

&#147;Waterstar, Sunstar!&#148;

Waterstar winked at her &#147;Sorry were late Lovestar.&#148;

&#147;Yes. We apologize for this, but we had to tie up some business.&#148;

Poison stepped up &#147;How&#146;d they get here?&#148;

&#147;Who cares? I&#146;ll crush &#145;em all without even using my full strength! 
Hey Plague! Finish her off and Poison and I will wipe out the other 
two.&#148;

Plague&#146;s smile returned, &#147; Lets end this brat.&#148;

Lovestar readied herself and stood firm with renewed strength. At 
least she didn&#146;t have to take these guys alone.

&#147;Lets go Sunstar!&#148;

&#147;Right!&#148;

Sunstar and Waterstar leapt of the pyramid of crates and ran towards 
Poison and Virus. Waterstar took on Virus and Sunstar took on Poison. 

Lovestar repeatedly punched and punched at Plague, but none of her 
attacks could bring themselves to connect. Mockingly he charged forth 
and rammed Lovestar into a nearby crate. This distracted Waterstar, 
and Virus used this to his advantage by giving her a solid punch to 
the face. She reeled back, but Virus continued with a flurry of 
stomach strikes. 

Sunstar swung her leg under Poison&#146;s feet and tugged at them. He fell 
backwards, but flipped over as his hands reached the floor. He landed 
a couple of metres away and reciprocated with a perfectly angled slide 
kick to Sunstar&#146;s shins. The Goddess of Knowledge yelped in pain as 
fell, only to be silenced with a sharp uppercut from poison.

Waterstar tried desperately to block Virus&#146; furious blows, but barely 
managed to defend herself. Waterstar leaned forwards, gasping 
desperately for breath as Virus&#146; fist drove into her ribcage and was 
then struck down as Virus&#146; elbow stabbed into her spine. 

Lovestar struggled to avoid to Plague&#146;s strikes but was not fast 
enough. She was kicked repeatedly as Plague managed to break through 
her last line of defence. The Chestnut haired starsoldier fell to the 
ground as his heel smashed into her back. She toppled over and coughed 
out a little blood. She turned over to see Waterstar trapped in a 
headlock. She felt her bones shake as she heard Waterstar 
scream&#133;Lovestar suddenly felt a furious anger cross heart. Without 
warning she was over come with rage as a surge of pure strength 
emanated from her body. Plague stepped back as Lovestar&#146;s body glowed 
with a furious golden light. Abruptly she stood and lost all control 
as she clenched her fists and let out an ear-piercing war cry.

Plague, Virus, Poison, Waterstar and Sunstar turned and stared taken 
aback by her, her body gleaming with a shinning golden light. 
Unexpectedly, she ran towards Virus and undauntedly, leapt into the 
air with a violent fierceness, and struck him with an incredibly 
powerful flying kick. The blow threw Virus straight off Waterstar and 
he went screaming into an old factory machine; denting its frame, the 
sheer force of the impact sending echoes around the warehouse. The 
angry starsoldier then turned and ran towards Poison, and without 
warning, struck him in the face with a violent punch. Poison yelled 
out in pain as he felt his jaw snap, clutching it as he fell to the 
ground. The light surrounding Lovestar died down, and she crouched 
over Sunstar, who was trying to pull herself up. 

&#147;Sunstar are you alright?&#148; Lovestar said as the last few traces of the 
golden energy left her.

&#147;Y-yes...I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Hay Waterstar&#133;Are you okay?&#148; Lovestar called out.

&#147;Sure&#133;I&#146;m alright.&#148; Waterstar said, startled by Lovestar.

&#147;I see it now.&#148; Sunstar said as she stood. &#147;The reason they seem so 
much more powerful then we are is because they are designed to fight 
us individually. They are built for each of us.&#148;

&#147;You sure it&#146;s not a little more than that?&#148; Waterstar said as she 
stared at Lovestar astounded by her power.

&#147;No. They are designed for each of us. Poison for me, Virus for you, 
and Plague for Lovestar.&#148;

&#147;So that means if we alternate&#133;&#148; Lovestar started

&#147;&#133;We can finish them off.&#148; Waterstar added

&#147;Right!&#148;

Shocked and frightened, Plague stepped back in fear.

&#147;&#133;Whether they found out our secret or not, there is no way the brat 
could do that kind of damage to Poison and Virus in that state&#133;&#148; 

Without warning, Waterstar ran towards Plague and dealt him a fast 
elbow strike to the stomach. Regaining momentum, she again struck with 
a vicious roundhouse kick to the face. Meanwhile Poison stood, holding 
his broken jaw, which was now gushing blood, and backing away from 
Lovestar who was carrying a vengeful smile on her face&#133;

&#147;&#133;Get away...Stop it&#133;Get away!&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Lovestar said evilly. &#147;You were Gung-ho about fighting 
us before, but now we found out your pathetic little secret, you&#146;re 
quivering like a coward&#133;&#148;

&#147;Why&#133;you (Ummph)!&#148;

Poison was silenced with a fast jab to his ribs, followed by a brutal 
kick that knocked the demon-monster to the ground. Punching rapidly, 
Virus tried to hit Sunstar, but no attack could stop her. Sunstar 
smirked at him, and Virus tried to hook her in return. Sunstar simply 
ducked under the swing, grabbed his shoulders and roundhouse threw 
Virus over her and he was sent sailing into a pile of crates. 

Lovestar stood and smiled and the frightened Poison

&#147;Alright right girls, what say we finish this?!&#148;

&#147;Yeah!&#148;

&#147;Very well...&#148;

All three girls stepped back and gathered energy for their attacks&#133;

&#147;Crushing Love Blast!&#148;

&#147;Crystal Frozen Fraction!&#148;

&#147;Shining Sunset Beam!&#148;

The three magic starsoldiers fired their attacks at the insidious 
trio, destroying them, as marvellous light filled the abandoned 
warehouse, the power of the energy echoing into the night. As the 
light subsided, the three left the warehouse before anyone else came 
around. They ran into a nearby alleyway and caught their breath. 

&#147;That was a close one.&#148; Lovestar said.

&#147; I know, but we did it didn&#146;t we?&#148; Waterstar reminded.

&#147;I say we all go home and rest. We should discuss this in the 
morning.&#148; Sunstar added.

&#147;Alright.&#148; 

&#147;Sure.&#148;

********** 	

Friday night 9.00, Yai&#146;s house

It had been 4 days since that vicious attack from the dark force. Yai 
was setting up a magnificent dinner for two. Her mom and dad left 
early for a night out, and said they wouldn&#146;t be back until morning. 
She assumed this would be the perfect time to reveal her feelings to 
Keiya, so she decided to cook her dinner. She had heard that the best 
way to a person&#146;s heart was their stomach. Well, actually it was a 
man&#146;s stomach, but hay, love is love right?  Yai talked to Alana, 
about the best way to break he news to Keiya. Yai had suggested that 
she seduce Keiya, but after a brief slap on the head, she realized 
that the best approach was the direct one. She would make Keiya dinner 
then tell her how she feels. Yai was still nervous; this kind of thing 
could kill a friendship, especially one as fragile as theirs is. But 
Yai knew that she would go crazy if she didn&#146;t confess her feelings 
soon. Then she heard a rap on her door. 

&#147; It&#146;s time.&#148; Yai thought to herself 

She exhaled slowly and walked over to the door. She opened it, and 
smiled sweetly at the person on her doorstep. 

&#147;Hi Keiya! How are you doing?&#148;

Keiya smiled and replied; &#147;I&#146;m doing just fine. Can I come in?&#148;

&#147;Sure. I invited you remember?&#148;

Keiya stepped in and Yai closed the door behind them. She blushed 
furiously when she saw what Keiya was wearing; a tight fitting, white 
T-shirt and a pair of blue jeans, which highlighted her stunning body. 
She tried to turn her gaze, but was transfixed. It wasn&#146;t a 
particularly gracefully outfit but Keiya still managed to look cute in 
it. Yai wondered how it was possible for Keiya to do this to her.

&#147;God she&#146;s beautiful. I hope I have a chance with her.&#148;

Keiya walked into the dining room and saw a lovely set table and 
mouth-watering food laid out on it.

&#147;So &#133;heh, heh, heh. What do you think?&#148;

Keiya was astounded. Candles, polished silverware, vintage imported 
English crockery&#133;

&#147;You did this&#133;for me?&#148;

Yai blushed again. &#147;Well&#133;it&#146;s sort of a thank you for taking care of 
me a week ago.&#148;

Keiya smiled at her lovingly. Yai&#146;s heart skipped beats when she saw 
this. She then regained composure, grabbed Keiya&#146;s hand and led her 
into the dining room. She sat her down and served out the fabulous 
meal she had prepared (with the help of a phone book). As the two ate, 
they talked about lots of things, chatting away, not really noticing 
the time. It seemed perfectly innocent, however both seemed a little 
troubled. Keiya acted a bit uneasily, and Yai was feigning normality, 
but in actuality, she was struggling to find the right time to tell 
Keiya. A couple of hours later, Keiya was getting ready to leave, and 
Yai was beating herself up mentally for letting this opportunity pass 
her by. Suddenly realized that it was now or never. But before she 
could speak, a confused Keiya turned around and stared at Yai with 
questioning look on her face.

&#147;Wait a minute. Yai, why did you do all of this?&#148;

&#147;What? I told you&#133; I wanted to repay you for&#133;&#148;

&#147;No, Yai I want the truth. Tell me. Why did you do all of this?&#148;

Yai stepped back a little. She could feel all the pent up emotions 
call forth the need to be released. She couldn&#146;t lie anymore. Keiya 
had to know everything.

&#147;I&#133;I had to do something! I&#146;m doing this because it&#146;s as close as 
you&#146;ll let me come. It&#146;s all I can do to get near you. I mean you let 
some stranger come so close to you and &#133;&#148;

&#147;Stranger?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#148;

&#147;Wait a minute&#133;are you talking about Shingo?&#148;

&#147;Well I&#133;&#148;

&#147;I told you he and I are just friends. We aren&#146;t seeing each other.&#148;

&#147;So why did you let him kiss you?&#148;

Keiya was at a loss for words when Yai said that. She had a point to a 
certain extent. She couldn&#146;t come up all well and good and say 
something like &#145;Oh, I did it so I could get over my feelings for you.&#146; 
Keiya fell silent.

&#147;You see. You can&#146;t answer me can you? When I try to get closer to 
you, you just push me away. You did it all through that dance&#133;do I 
mean nothing to you? Don&#146;t you even care about me?&#148; 

Yai could feel the tears in her eyes well up when she said those 
words, and Keiya stepped towards her, stunned.

&#147;Of course I do! How could you say something like that?&#148;

&#147;Can you blame me? You&#146;ve been trying so hard to avoid me. What am I 
supposed to think?&#148;

&#147;I&#133;I mean&#133;I just&#133;&#148;

&#147;Do you hate me that much Keiya?&#148; 

Yai&#146;s tears dropped freely as she spoke. She closed her eyes in 
sadness, feeling the weight of the reality of the situation sink 
inside her. Yai&#146;s shoulders fell as she hung her head lowly, in shame. 
Is this what it all comes down to? Just as she began to sob openly, 
Yai felt Keiya grab her shoulders. She opened her eyes sharply and saw 
Keiya staring at her with an unwavering gaze.

&#147;Oh gods no Yai! If you only knew how much I&#133;&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; Tears streamed down Yai&#146;s face as her head shot up in 
confusion, and stared into Keiya&#146;s transfixed glare.

Keiya&#146;s eyes opened widely as she realized the inclination of her 
words. The Lilac haired starlet stopped herself before she reached the 
point of no return and thoughtlessly grabbed her coat as she began 
backing away towards the door.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry&#133;I&#146;ll leave&#133;&#148; Keiya said, her arm fumbling to reach the 
doorknob in her haste. 

&#147;&#133;No wait!&#148; 

Keiya&#146;s head shook from side to side. &#147;No. I-I have to leave&#133;I can&#146;t 
stay.&#148;

&#147;Please Keiya wait&#133;!&#148; A quiet sense of reason absolved Yai, anything 
to get Keiya to stay, and she gently reached out to clasp Keiya&#146;s 
wrist. Keiya batted her hand away sharply, stunning both her and Yai. 
She didn&#146;t mean it to be so hard, but her number one priority was to 
leave. Just to get away from this. Yai again tried to grab Keiya&#146;s 
wrist, this time a bit more sternly, but it wasn&#146;t enough. Yai&#146;s quiet 
reason left as she became filled with annoyance. Ever since they had 
looked into each other&#146;s eyes that first day they met, Keiya had been 
running from her. At each turn and at each step, Keiya had gone out of 
her way to block her out. She had so much to ask and so much to tell&#133; 
but how could she say anything with Keiya running from her all the 
time? Keiya could sense the emotional change inside of the chestnut 
haired girl, and a shame so deep and heavy it was physically painful, 
sunk into her stomach. It wasn&#146;t like her to act this way. 

&#147;Can&#146;t Yai see that this is for the best? If she caught onto my 
feelings for her, she&#146;d probably force me out and never speak to me 
again&#133; I would never have the pleasure to see her beautiful smile, 
that same smile that illuminates me every time I have the luck to see 
it. The only thing those amazing emerald eyes would carry in my 
presence is hatred. And I just couldn&#146;t stand that. I can&#146;t stand to 
have my heart broken again&#133; not again&#133;&#148;

Yai finally ran tired of this stupid game of hide and chase. She was 
tired of Keiya running from her, tired of having no answers to her 
question, answers she now desperately needed. Just as Keiya turned to 
face away from her, the chestnut haired girl rose up and ran round 
Keiya&#146;s side startling the Lilac haired beauty greatly, but she 
wouldn&#146;t let that prevent her from reaching her goal. Yai swiftly 
moved in front of the door and stared halting at Keiya, her emerald 
eyes fixed so attentively at the figure before them.  

&#147;No! You&#146;re not leaving here! Not yet. Not until you tell me why you 
keep shutting me out of your life!&#148; Yai demanded.  

&#147;Yai&#133;please don&#146;t do this&#133;&#148; Keiya looked down to the ground, just as 
she felt a tear trickle down her cheek, away from Yai&#146;s eyes. She 
could see it already&#133; the anger&#133;

&#147;Just tell me&#133;please? &#133;I want to know&#133;&#148; Yai tried to reason with her 
one more time.

Keiya gave in finally. Yai&#146;s request tore out what little heartstrings 
she had left. To hear her beautiful voice carry so much pain&#133;she 
couldn&#146;t stand it anymore. And she couldn&#146;t stand to hide her desire 
any longer either. It was just too hard. She couldn&#146;t run from her 
feelings any more. Keiya didn&#146;t know if it was courage, exhaustion or 
a part of her, which still had hope, but she suddenly felt the will of 
confession possess her. Yai could also see the change inside of her, 
whether it was for the good or the bad, she could feel that Keiya was 
prepared to open herself&#133; open her heart. Keiya looked directly at 
Yai, her face, disposition and body language were plain, showing no 
outward emotion, but her eyes&#133; in her eyes, flashed passion, fire, 
desire and boldness, but for the first time, Yai could she what was 
truly behind them&#133; love.

&#147;I&#146;m in love with you.&#148; Keiya said simply. 

&#147;&#133;You&#133;&#148; Yai could barely bring herself to speak. That one statement 
hit her so hard she could have fallen over&#133; she didn&#146;t realize it but 
her heart began to beat rapidly, the room seemed to increase in 
temperature almost immediately, every thing felt like a warped reality 
all of a sudden. When you desire something, something that seems so 
out of reach, and it comes true&#133; the feeling you get is indescribable. 
The sorrow and anger that had filled her was replaced by such joy and 
elation, she could barely contain it.   

&#147;It&#146;s not possible&#133;Oh god if this is a dream, please don&#146;t ever wake 
me.&#148; Yai thought.

&#147;I&#146;m so sorry. But that&#146;s how I feel. So now you understand why I had 
to avoid you.&#148; Keiya said, her voice reeking with regret and shame.

Yai was still shocked. &#147;I&#133;can&#146;t believe it&#133;you feel the same way I 
do&#133;&#148;

Keiya looked at Yai with disbelief. &#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;Oh Keiya&#133; I love you too! I knew I felt that way the first time I met 
you, I just didn&#146;t realize it until last week. I feel the same way! 
I&#146;m in love with you Keiya.&#148; 

Keiya couldn&#146;t believe it. All this time, Yai had been harbouring 
feelings for her. All this time. A part of her wanted to run away. The 
idea of Yai loving her was so overwhelming&#133; she had dreamed about this 
before. She was always at home, lying on her bed, lost in a light 
sleep in a long, patterned white silk dress. The windows were open and 
drifting in was a cool summer night&#146;s breeze. Suddenly, Yai would 
charge in, Keiya could never picture what she was wearing, all she 
needed and all she wanted was to focus on Yai, which she did. Or at 
least she tried to do, but before Keiya could speak with a quick; 
&#145;&#133;Yai&#133;?&#146; she was cut off by Yai charging over to her and forcing her 
lips onto her own.  The dream would always end there, and the crystal 
eyed girl would remember nothing but the sheer rapture of her parched 
lips being quenched by the sweet elixir of Yai&#146;s. Up until now, the 
idea of her and Yai sharing any kind of relationship together existed 
merely in her dreams. At least that thought was safe. A dream couldn&#146;t 
leave her. But Yai actually said it. The six words she had wanted to 
hear since she first stared into Yai&#146;s gorgeous jade eyes&#133; &#147;I&#146;m in 
love with you Keiya&#148; and as hard as it was to believe, this wasn&#146;t a 
dream. It was reality&#133; Yai was in love with her, and she was in love 
with Yai&#133; 

&#147;You&#133;you mean you&#133;Oh Yai&#133;I&#133;&#148;

Yai smiled and blushed. No words needed to be spoken. Yai slowly moved 
towards Keiya, and wrapped her arms around the lilac haired angel&#146;s 
waist. Keiya looked at Yai and also smiled, happily. She clasped Yai&#146;s 
cheeks and tilted her head slightly. Then she leaned towards her, 
descending upon Yai&#146;s crimson red lips, gently pressing them together. 
As Keiya kissed her, Yai&#146;s hand left Keiya&#146;s waist and she ran it 
through the silky lilac hair, which enveloped her beautiful face. 
Finally Yai Kitana and Keiya Shindo let it all out and admit their 
love for each other, and start life anew. In each other&#146;s arms.
