<h1>Project Angelus (part 16 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>      &quot;Did something happen to upset you?&quot; Solomon asked, following a clearly unhappy 
Pandora through the mansion.

      &quot;Not upsetting,&quot; the little girl replied sharply. &quot;Just confusing.&quot;

      The young man said nothing back as he continued into her room with her. Pandora 
motioned to one of her female Death Dolls and the young woman immediately started to pull 
at the laces on the back of the fiend&#39;s dress.

      &quot;I just don&#39;t understand how... how a fiend would be helping out humans and fighting 
her own kind!&quot;

      Solomon frowned. &quot;You found another fiend?&quot;

      &quot;It was a woman who was like a fiend...&quot; Pandora murmured as the top of her dress 
began to loosen. Her male companion politely turned the other way as she slipped out of it. 
&quot;She was a human with a fiend&#39;s spirit and signature energy. But she wasn&#39;t strong like 
us.&quot;

      &quot;Just a regular demon,&quot; Solomon stated as Pandora began to go over to the bathroom, 
clad only in her undershirt and panties.

      &quot;I know. It&#39;s just a waste,&quot; Pandora said crossly. &quot;Like Lilith. She&#39;s wasting such 
great power by following around our temporary master.&quot;

      &quot;True. But she&#39;s still a human girl with insecurities and needs,&quot; Solomon said.

      Pandora pouted. &quot;I wanted her to come over because she was hurt but she refused...&quot;

      Solomon began to chuckle. &quot;You were planning on changing her, weren&#39;t you?&quot;

      &quot;I just wanted to help her! If I were just to coax her human body with some of my 
magic, she would become something truly great, wouldn&#39;t she?&quot;

      Solomon nodded. &quot;Indeed. Humans are so fragile yet so versatile. In some way, we were 
all humans once...&quot;

      Pandora grinned. &quot;And with the power of God we could change all of that. Fiends... 
fiends everywhere! Then all the humans and the angels and the demons will be the 
minorities, the ones hiding for cover!&quot;

      As she headed into the bathroom with a few of her Death Dolls to help her bathe, 
Solomon was thinking of other things. Adrian, the CEO of the Shadow Organization hadn&#39;t 
captured Sakura like he wanted to... but that was none of his concern.

      Eveon was the person he needed to think about. If he could capture her that would 
mean the power would be in the hands of Adrian, who would thus grant them a portion to turn 
humans into fiends... plus, Eveon would make a perfect gift for a still upset Pandora.

      He left the little girl&#39;s room with a smile on his face and a plan formulating in his 
head. 

***** 

      &quot;I hope it wasn&#39;t an eventful night,&quot; Eveon whispered to Miki.

      The green eyed girl shook her head. &quot;I was kind of expecting to get... well, devoured 
or something, but it was fine.&quot;

      &quot;You mean it was okay they did stuff to you?!&quot;

      &quot;No!&quot; Miki said, a little too loudly. &quot;I meant that nothing happened.&quot;

      Eveon just nodded her head slowly. &quot;Huh. I guess they really were just teasing you 
since you&#39;re such a homophobe.&quot;

      With that, the blonde continued walking down the sidewalk behind the three sisters. 
&quot;H-Homophobe? I&#39;m not a homophobe, Eveon!&quot;

      Miki, unfortunately, couldn&#39;t see the smiling girl&#39;s face and realize it was all 
really a joke. Hoshi watched the exchange over her shoulder, a small smile on her face. It 
was nice to see them so relaxed... especially since...

      &quot;How close are they?&quot; She asked Tsuki quietly.

      &quot;I can feel a dark presence surrounding us... about five miles?&quot; The brunette 
responded. She couldn&#39;t see the Death Dolls or fiends, but her holy power resonated with 
the darkness coming closer.

      Hina smiled. &quot;Then it&#39;s a good thing I set up preliminary traps so we&#39;re not at that 
much of a disadvantage.&quot;

      &quot;This looks like an okay spot,&quot; Hoshi said, stopping. &quot;Hina, can you prepare your 
threads to-&quot;

      She didn&#39;t even have to finish for the blonde to understand. &quot;Yep! I&#39;ll set it up for 
sure.&quot;

      Hoshi looked over at Tsuki, who was already planting seals around them, her arm 
glowing as she did so.

      Miki and Eveon exchanged glances before the green eyed girl asked, &quot;What are you 
doing?&quot;

      &quot;We&#39;re about to be ambushed,&quot; Hoshi said, confidently holding her staff. &quot;Both of you 
aren&#39;t proficient in fighting, so you&#39;ll stay in the middle where we can guard you.&quot;

      &quot;Cool, sounds like a plan to me,&quot; Eveon said with a smile. &quot;It&#39;s nice to have such 
great exorcists around to protect us, huh Miki?&quot;

      &quot;Proficient? I can fight! I just... I just tend to hold back, that&#39;s all...!&quot; Miki 
protested, not happy to be relegated to the back lines.

      &quot;Hesitation will always lead to someone being hurt,&quot; Hoshi said, now serious. Any of 
her previous teasing demeanor was gone. &quot;If you can&#39;t fight at your fullest, then you&#39;re a 
liability.&quot;

      Miki frowned. If it were just her and Eveon, she&#39;d have no problem, but in front of 
strangers...? She hugged herself and unhappily followed Eveon to the center. Hina, Tsuki 
and Hoshi were making a triangle around them.

      Eveon knew how good the sisters were, even without actually seeing Hoshi fight 
before. Miki, on the other hand, didn&#39;t know what to expect... it didn&#39;t take long for the 
Death Dolls to erupt seemingly out of nowhere.

      They were dealt with almost immediately as Hina threw her weapons accurately, the 
spirit threads attached to the handles creating a net and entrapping their attackers. It 
only took Tsuki two seals to take out the dolls in front of her while Hoshi drew and 
sheathed her sword so fast that Miki barely noticed she&#39;d attacked until the Death Dolls 
collapsed.

      Miki Uramoto officially felt outclassed in the &#39;protecting&#39; area...

      &quot;You&#39;re all quite good,&quot; came a male voice and Eveon recognized it immediately.

      &quot;Gah, it&#39;s the fiend who tried to kidnap me...!&quot;

      He appeared in front of them confidently, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword. 
&quot;I would appreciate it if you could give me Eveon... She&#39;d make a nice addition to our 
collection.&quot;

      &quot;What, so you can throw her around like a toy in a fight like this?!&quot; Miki shouted, 
referring to all the motionless Death Dolls.

      Solomon just smiled. &quot;Of course not! Eveon&#39;s much too precious to be used as a 
soldier.&quot;

      Hoshi gripped the top of her staff, quite unsure of her abilities to take out a 
fiend. She&#39;d done it once before, but that had been against a rather weak one. She couldn&#39;t 
even sense his true strength. Her sisters were just as anxious as he slowly drew his rapier 
and assumed a rather ordinary fencing position.

      It happened much too fast, even for Hoshi. She&#39;d barely drawn her sword when thrust 
at her. How she was able to block it with her sheath and sword in time was beyond her, but 
the parry allowed him to slip past her where Hina attempted to entrap him in her threads.

      They slipped right off of him, unable to withstand his dark aura and even Tsuki&#39;s 
seals weren&#39;t fast enough to catch him. Hoshi realized her mistake as he continued towards 
his goal. She didn&#39;t really parry his blow - he purposefully allowed her to block so he 
could get behind her.

      &quot;Miki!&quot; She cried out, but the green eyed girl already had her sword drawn, ready to 
defend Eveon.

      &quot;Do you really think you can stand up to my power?&quot; Solomon asked, ready to swing at 
Miki and shatter her sword.

      His blade connected with hers, the dark energy disappearing from it as they struggled 
to overpower the other. &quot;I can&#39;t pierce that aura around you,&quot; she breathed out. &quot;But I can 
cancel out any magic your using as a weapon!&quot;

      &quot;Regardless, a regular sword will do,&quot; he said confidently, sliding his blade down 
hers as he moved to the side.

      Miki could feel that same ethereal blue energy come out of her and she used it to 
increase her reaction time. With a twist of her wrist, she parried his blade and attempted 
to strike him. Her sword only hit air as he backed away. &quot;So you really are a half angel, 
half demon hybrid then,&quot; he said, resuming his stance, only to notice the sisters preparing 
to attack him again.

      &quot;Do you really think you have the precision to actually hurt me?&quot; He asked, raising 
up his sword. &quot;I believe I&#39;ve wasted too much time playing around.&quot;

      Without warning, he sent a large wave of dark energy at them, startling Hoshi at the 
sheer magnitude and concentration of it. She tried her best to shelter her sisters, but the 
power was so overwhelming that they all collapsed under the power of it. Miki tried her 
best to counteract it and get Eveon out of the way, but it didn&#39;t take too long for her to 
fall over, barely conscious.

      When it all cleared, Eveon stood there, her right hand shining like a beacon. She 
looked around, only to see her defenders out cold and one very malicious fiend standing in 
front of her with a not so comforting smile on his face.

      &quot;Crap,&quot; she murmured, looking down at her hand. Why couldn&#39;t the Seal of Light do 
something cool, like wound the guy? Or give her wings? Or even just teleport her and her 
friends somewhere safe?

      &quot;It seems the Key to God is such a strong power... enough to even resist that much 
power,&quot; Solomon said calmly, as though he were educating Eveon instead of planning on 
abducting her.

      &quot;Uh... right... I guess it is,&quot; she said dumbly, trying to stall. &quot;Do you know what 
else it does?&quot;

      Solomon seemed momentarily surprised by her question. &quot;Well... it opens the Gate to 
the Creator, the being that created the gods and goddesses that used to watch over us all.&quot; 
He stopped to think. &quot;I&#39;m quite sure that the Key to God should give you all the elemental 
powers, though...&quot;

      &quot;All of them? But I have the Seal of Light,&quot; Eveon said, looking at her hand. If she 
could keep Solomon talking... &quot;And it&#39;s only been doing that.&quot;

      &quot;Strange. Perhaps it hasn&#39;t developed yet?&quot;

      &quot;Developed?&quot; Eveon said, confused. &quot;You mean there is a lot more to this than one 
seal?&quot;

      &quot;There is the Guardian of Light, who bestows the Seal of Light on a worthy human 
female. In turn, the Seal of Light will grow and transform into Key to God,&quot; Solomon said, 
matter of fact. &quot;You have all the powers, but they haven&#39;t developed yet. They should all 
come out once you reach the Gate.&quot;

      &quot;Those powers wouldn&#39;t happen to be some cool ability that could save me from 
trouble, would it?&quot; Eveon asked, hopeful.

      &quot;I&#39;m afraid not. Though once the Seal of Light turns into the Key to God, then you 
would have control over all the elements, which is thus a small replica of the Creator&#39;s 
powers,&quot; Solomon replied. &quot;It is the ultimate power to create or destroy. You would just 
get an infinitely small fraction to wield.&quot;

      Eveon nodded, looking down at her hand. Could she have enough power to at least take 
care of Solomon?

      &quot;Of course, we could discuss more of this once I take you back home.&quot;

      Crap. Time was up. Eveon looked up at him and started to back away. &quot;That&#39;s fine. I 
mean, you probably don&#39;t want me, uh... tracking my lesbian cooties into your place!&quot;

      Solomon paused and Eveon hoped that would turn him off on the whole principle of 
kidnapping her. &quot;Lesbian... cooties...?&quot; He murmured, more to himself than anyone else. &quot;Is 
that what you humans call it? I believe the term is homosexual, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

      &quot;Uh, sure, gay, lesbian, homosexual, all that, but uh... doesn&#39;t that bother you?&quot;

      Solomon just smiled. &quot;No, I&#39;m sure Pandora will find it quite endearing - she&#39;s 
always had a penchant for same sex couples.&quot;

      Eveon didn&#39;t know who Pandora was and she really, really, REALLY did not want to find 
out. Why couldn&#39;t she count on homophobia to save her butt this one time? She froze when 
she felt a tug on the bottom of her jeans. Miki was trying to use her as a support to get 
up.

      &quot;I guess being a hybrid makes you more resistant to attacks of dark or light 
element,&quot; the fiend said, as though he were still enlightening Eveon on the workings of the 
Key to God.

      Eveon kneeled down to try and help the girl up. The most Miki could get to were her 
knees and she was leaning heavily against the blonde girl. &quot;Miki, are you alright?&quot;

      &quot;Y-yeah... I said I would protect you, right?&quot; Eveon could have clocked her on the 
head like that when she got an idea. If the Seal of Light could protect her from Solomon&#39;s 
attack, then it should be able to cure Miki of whatever damage had been inflicted on her.

      She wasted no time placing her right hand on the green eyed girl&#39;s shoulder and 
allowing the light energy to pulse into her body. Solomon noticed and started coming 
towards them, knowing that he didn&#39;t have time to be stalling.

      However, before he could reach them, that same blue green light erupted from Miki&#39;s 
body, making Solomon back away. It was crackling in the air, almost like a shield to keep 
him away... if he were to try and break through it, he&#39;d doubt it would be successful.

      With Eveon channeling light energy into Miki and the girl&#39;s strange power wrapping 
around all five of them, it was much too strong and risky. &quot;I suppose I will come back 
another time,&quot; he said with a smile. He disappeared suddenly in a whorl off shadows, 
surprising Eveon.

      &quot;He actually left?!&quot; All of his Death Dolls had vanished as well. She stood up, 
ecstatic. &quot;You see that, Miki? You scared him off!&quot;

      She turned to congratulate her friend, only to see that Miki had fallen over on her 
side. &quot;So... tired... stupid fiend...&quot;

      Eveon turned to the sisters, who were still unconscious. &quot;Do you know what happened 
to you guys?&quot;

      Miki was trying to sit up, but failing miserably. &quot;Dark energy poison... if too much 
of one element overwhelms your body, it isn&#39;t a good thing. Especially if you aren&#39;t 
resistant to that element...&quot;

      That would explain why everyone was hurting... &quot;Is there a way to cure it?&quot; Eveon 
asked, helping her friend sit up.

      &quot;Just use the Seal of Light to counteract the darkness and it should leave our 
systems,&quot; Miki murmured out as Eveon began to the tedious task of healing them all.
