~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Inside the Diet Building

Sheets of watering frost slid of the walls and ceiling of that 
door-less, window-less room, crashing into the floor beneath. 
The air was wracked with the sensation of mixture between warmth 
and chill. Fire and Ice. That enormous build-up of frost created 
from the Kogoeta Kankyou technique was now melting away like 
nothing at all. Seeping into the nothingness from which it had 
been conjured. The clash between the mighty superpowers of 
Kogoeta Kankyou and the Monosugoi Uma Hitoiki had decided the 
fight... but Shiki was far too consumed with what she was seeing 
now to be concerned with the outcome of the battle. Or the 
condition of the room around her. 

She looked down with those flabbergasted emerald eyes of hers 
and stared disbelievingly at the young shinobi whom she had been 
fighting against. The so-called &#145;Cat Mask&#39;. But once that mask 
had been knocked from his face... it revealed the truth to 
Shiki. Revealing all the startling realities that Shiki had so 
carelessly been ignoring. 

...The Ice Shinobi was Uchida Hibuki. Older Brother of Uchida 
Haruko and a final year senior at Kimagure Gakuen. The same man 
whom had won a stuffed animal for Hazumaru Yui at Kushinami 
Arcade. All this time he was a member of the Six Orochi. It 
explained why someone so lazy-looking could have scored thirty 
baskets in a row. And why Shiki had gotten such an icy chill 
when she had first met the boy. He was working for Hirotsugu. 

Shiki couldn&#39;t believe it. &quot;H-Hibuki-san... But... why? Why 
would you...?&quot;

Hibuki looked up at the young kunoichi, his body laid out for 
the kill, his stomach impaled by her sharp shuriken. He was as 
confused as she was. &quot;...You know my birth name? Who... are 
you...?&quot;

It was now that Shiki began to see that Hibuki still didn&#39;t know 
who she really was. Even if that didn&#39;t apply in the reverse. 
The girl said nothing. What could she say? She had believed 
Hibuki to be her friend. She was strengthening her resolve to 
stop Hirotsugu because of her will to protect this boy; as well 
as his sister. Was it all a lie? Had she really risked her life 
for this man who was trying to kill her? Hibuki looked up at the 
girl. He probed her. Looking deep at her with all the ninja 
observational skills he could muster. Hibuki looked up into her 
softening and frightened green eyes. Those eyes... he had seen 
before. And it all came flooding back to him. Those same 
innocent jade orbs... the same as...

Hibuki blinked... &quot;Yui-san.&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t believe this...&quot; Shiki looked down at her friend&#39;s 
brother, &quot;All this time you&#39;ve been a member of 
Hirotsugu-yarou&#39;s little Orochi hit squad!? You even killed 
Sakamoto-san last night! That was where you were! You lied to 
your own sister! You&#39;re a liar!&quot;

Hibuki smiled solemnly whilst closing his eyes. &quot;What did you 
expect me to do? Tell her what I&#39;ve been doing at night? Did 
really you expect me to drag my little sister into any of this? 
What do you think I&#39;ve been fighting for? Haruko-chan is the 
only reason I&#39;m involved in the machinations of the Honshu 
Koga.&quot;

&quot;...What&#39;s that supposed to mean...?&quot; Shiki asked. 

&quot;You haven&#39;t got time for this,&quot; Hibuki told her, &quot;I know why 
you&#39;re here. Probably to pump information about Hirotsugu-san 
from Fujiwara-sama. Well I won&#39;t stop you anymore than I have, 
Yui-san. Come on. Finish it. Perform that which every shinobi 
must upon victory. The finishing blow.&quot;

Shiki froze. She could hardly move. Hibuki was actually 
expecting her to kill him. And her fist trembled. From the idea 
of it and from the weird humidity caused by the surrounding 
mixture of flame and ice. Her shaking hand trembled as it 
reached back for the hilt of Miyuki. A swift stroke to an 
unguarded neck with it would chop off a head in seconds. 

It would be so simple. 

And for the first time... Shiki felt a violent clash between her 
two conjoined personas. The side of her that was the innocent 
youth; Hazumaru Yui, was begging for Hibuki&#39;s life to be spared. 
And the darker side of her that was Shiki... was demanding 
Hibuki&#39;s blood to be spilt. To watch his lifeless carcass burn 
in the flames of her Ninjutsu. 

She was so torn... 

SAVE HIM

...What choice could she make?

KILL HIM

...What was the right thing to do?

SAVE HIM

...What was the smart thing to do?

KILL HIM 

...What should she do...?

Hibuki intently watched Shiki&#39;s eyes as they shook with the 
frustration of that tremendous battle she was fighting inside 
herself. Then watched as the kunoichi of flame rose up. And she 
didn&#39;t lay a finger on her sword. But looked down at Hibuki with 
a vivid, disparaging glance. Hibuki gave her a curious 
expression.

&quot;You would break the shinobi code?&quot; He asked, &quot;We are bound by 
blood to kill our enemies. To show no mercy regardless of 
personal feelings. Would you really spare me?&quot;

Shiki looked away. &quot;...Yes.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;...Because it would break Haruko-san&#39;s heart...&quot; Shiki replied, 
a cold sadness welling up in those beautiful and intense green 
eyes of hers, &quot;...And I care about her too much to do that.&quot;

Hibuki&#39;s surprised expression turned into a knowing smile. 
&quot;...You&#39;re fond of my sister, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Shiki said nothing. It was true... but there was no way she 
could admit that now. Uchida Haruko had grown to be far more 
important to Shiki than anyone could of imagined in such a short 
space of time. 

Hibuki took the silence as a screaming &#39;yes&#39;. Now he knew that 
this outsider kunoichi had something to protect. There could 
have been no better candidate... &quot;So... Genryukai-sama was right 
after all. You really are worthy... to be the first to read the 
Scroll of Mizuryu...&quot;

&quot;...What on earth are you talking about...?&quot; Shiki questioned. 

The blonde boy eased up a bit, ignoring the pain of the shuriken 
lodged in his stomach to speak those intended words of his. &quot;I 
think it&#39;s time I explained myself to you. About why I work for 
Hirotsugu-san. And what his plans really are...&quot;

Before either Hibuki or Shiki could say anything more, a third 
voice rang in that particular  room of the National Diet 
Building. &quot;...What a surprise. You failed to kill the girl, 
Hibuki-san?&quot;

Both of them looked behind. Where the voice was coming from. A 
speedy blur zipped into the vision of both shinobi. It settled 
into another figure. One more strident and powerful than anyone 
Shiki had seen before. A tall, muscular yet lithe young man. 
Topless from the baggy multi-coloured dragon-print slacks and 
the red belt around his waist. Revealing a perfectly honed 
chest. Toned and muscled. His spiky brown hair shot up and 
backwards in an animalist style; while the bulk of his hair hand 
been braided into an elongated ponytail that swayed against his 
ankles. Within his blood red eyes existed a kind of controlled 
insanity that could strike fear into the hearts of even the 
bravest warriors. His soul possessed a kind of power that took 
generations to gain. And took even longer to control. In his 
hand was a sort of crescent moon-bladed glaive named Mikazuki 
Satsujinki (Crescent Butcher). It was razor-sharp and brutally 
deadly. Armed with such a weapon; Shiki felt humbled just 
looking at this shinobi. But remained fixed in her position; now 
getting defensive. A blind man in the dark could see that this 
newcomer ninja was out for blood. Duty or not. 

Hibuki knew who he was. Quite well, in fact. &quot;...Yagami-san.&quot;

&quot;Who?!&quot; Shiki asked, keeping her gaze on the newly arrived young 
man. 

&quot;Yagami-san,&quot; The Uchida Brother said, &quot;The Fifth of the Six 
Orochi. He is probably the most powerful of us all. He is 
Hirotsugu&#39;s right hand man and has been watching over 
Fujiwara-sama like a hawk for some time now.&quot;

Soon Yagami joined in on the talk. &quot;Exchanging my secrets with 
the girl from Morioka? Heh. It must have been a trade for your 
life. No matter. You still failed us, Hibuki-san. Failure is not 
tolerated by the Orochi nor Hirotsugu-sama. It is time I amended 
all your mistakes. And once I am finished with this miserable 
country girl... you will be disciplined for your failure. With 
the punishment of death. Just like Zanmaru-san and Ryoko-san.&quot;

Shiki blinked. &quot;Ryoko-san is dead?&quot;

A dark chuckle escaped Yagami&#39;s lips. &quot;I sliced her open 
myself.&quot;

&quot;Well, pal...&quot; Shiki didn&#39;t much care for Ryoko anyways... &quot;I 
really couldn&#39;t give a damn about what you do to your 
team-mates. But I&#39;ve come here to speak with Fujiwara-sama. If 
you get in the way... then you&#39;ll go down like the rest of your 
Orochi buddies have so far.&quot;

Again, Yagami merely chuckled. &quot;Save your posing for victory. If 
you can achieve it. Those who assume a win before the fight has 
begun... are usually the ones to fall. Your arrogance has 
annoyed Hirotsugu-sama for far too long. So you will fight me 
now. My Glaive demands that I redeem the proud name of the Six 
Orochi. Behold our true power first hand.&quot;

Shiki grinned at him; unaware of that worried look in Hibuki&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;Cocky bastard. I&#39;ve got nothing to fear from some 
boisterous little pretty-boy who gets off on slaughtering those 
he calls his comrades. Once I have you beaten... Hirotsugu-yarou 
will be next.&quot;

But that was something Yagami did not respond to. It would be 
better to start the fight. And to see which of them would fulfil 
their objectives here. To be honest; Shiki wanted this over and 
done with. The Six Orochi had stood in her way for far too long. 
If she could take down their top dog; taking care of Hirotsugu 
would be a snap. So the flaming kunoichi narrowed her eyes and 
charged ahead. Her sandaled feet pushed her straight towards the 
distant and still Yagami, whom remained with Mikazuki Satsujinki 
strapped to his back. Unmoving. Once they were close enough to 
each other for a full-body attack, Shiki artistically leapt 
upwards; holding her fists against her sides. Then she branched 
out her lissom leg in a thunderous flying kick. Yagami stayed as 
still as ever, then swiftly brought up his right hand. So fast 
and so quick that Shiki could barely see the action. His meaty 
but swift hand rotated outwardly at the same point at which 
Shiki&#39;s leg attacked. The girl gasped as the back of Yagami&#39;s 
wrist knocked against her ankle; batting her out of the flying 
kick effortlessly. Shiki stumbled on the ground while Yagami 
retained his cool disposition; not even using the opportunity to 
attack his momentarily unguarded opponent. 

Hibuki looked worried. He couldn&#39;t make much of a move from his 
laid out position. Shiki&#39;s shuriken had hit him in an awkward 
place in his stomach. It made even standing up a chore. There 
was little he could do now but watch.

Shiki stood upright and swung her body around, vaulting 
backwards. Yagami was physically stronger than her. Which was no 
great surprise; considering the bulk of lithe muscle he was 
carrying around with him. Shiki scowled and reached back around 
her waist and gripped the hilt of her faithful bamboo sword 
(Miyuki). Time to up the ante a little. The woman then gave a 
powerful glare from those expressive emerald eyes and launched 
herself towards the taller, stronger Yagami. Mid-run she 
withdrew Miyuki and slashed right at Yagami&#39;s chest. It hit dead 
centre and went straight through his upper body. But that image 
of Yagami then faded away like a hologram before Shiki&#39;s eyes. 
He had vanished?

Shiki looked for him. Then felt someone lightly tap her 
shoulder. &quot;Hey. Behind you.&quot;

It was him! Shiki jumped forwards to escape any impending attack 
and then turned around to see the boy. But like lightning he had 
vanished again. Shiki stopped herself. With Miyuki in a 
defensive pose she looked again for him. Yagami was incredibly 
fast. A great deal faster than Hibuki. What if she couldn&#39;t keep 
up with him? She continued to look around for the older youth; 
but found nothing. Fortunately (or unfortunately as the case may 
be) Yagami found her first. Shiki gave a powerful and 
heart-rending cry of agony as the taller shinobi ruthlessly 
thrust his foot into the centre of her back in one devastatingly 
abrupt kick. The girl was hurled off her feet instantly and sent 
sailing. Her body writhed in the air and her torso soon slapped 
against the smooth floor of this room. By now the ice on the 
ground had yet to begin to melt. So it was even harder to walk 
or stop herself; due to the lack of traction. Shiki gave an 
&#145;oof&#39; sound from her parted lips from the shock of her sudden 
grounding. Then took a moment to compose herself. She opened her 
eyes again and rolled over to one side. To see Yagami standing 
there. Silently. 

Shiki seethed, &quot;Bastard,&quot; then heaved herself upwards. This 
Yagami character was really was different from his Orochi 
friends. Not only was he very strong, but his speed was amazing. 
In fact; Shiki could hardly keep up with his movements. There 
were few who could dodge such a close strike from Miyuki. But 
Yagami could. Something that Shiki really hadn&#39;t expected. Aside 
from the exception of Hibuki; most of the Six Orochi seemed to 
be all talk. But not this man. What Yagami lacked in charisma he 
made up for in relentless power. 

Well Shiki couldn&#39;t allow herself to be beaten after coming this 
far. The nimble young woman reached downwards into the one of 
the side pockets of her slacks. Using her left hand. She hooked 
three of her fingers into the ring holes of three of her 
shuriken. She was not expecting any trouble when she came to the 
Diet Building but she still came prepared. The girl pulled free 
three of her sharp-edge shuriken and held them in hand, before 
her face. With the other hand she made the now standard 
two-finger sign of the shinobi. A few seconds passed and then 
those three shuriken reacted to the action. A small but healthy 
flame burst over each of them. Though they did not burn Shiki&#39;s 
hand. Her Burning Spirit could withstand all forms of fire. Her 
green eyes returned to their glare on Yagami. 

&quot;...San Shuri-Hou...&quot; She spoke...

...Then performed. Shiki yelled a feminine cry then swung her 
arm around her body and hurled the three flaming shuriken at the 
target. Yagami. The San Shuri-Hou (Three Shuri Flame) sliced 
through the humid air towards the Fifth Orochi with great speed. 
But Yagami did not shrink at this either. His hand reached 
behind for the shaft his crescent moon glaive. There was a dark 
scowl on his face. It seemed that he expected more. But he was 
unaware that Shiki was making that two-fingered sign once more. 
Yagami simply pulled out the Mikazuki Satsujinki with lightning 
speed and acted. His double-armed strokes were both powerful and 
fast. His hands worked like magic as they worked the 
crescent-moon glaive to deflect each of the fire-infused 
shuriken individually. Each of the three were batted away before 
they even reached within a metre of Yagami. 

...Yet Shiki simply smiled... &quot;Shunhenkou!&quot;

A surprised glare both hit Yagami and the downed Hibuki. A puff 
of mystic smoke enfolded both Shiki and one of the shuriken that 
Yagami had deflected seconds ago. When the smoke faded they were 
switched with each other. Which positioned Shiki right above 
Yagami. He realized this all too late. The girl swiftly drew 
Miyuki and then slashed downwards at the cranium of the 
spiky-haired shinobi. Yagami&#39;s senses kicked into overdrive as 
he launched himself backwards away from the stroke. But not 
enough to avoid damage. Shiki grit her teeth and Yagami 
screamed. The Miyuki short sword cut straight through the build 
up of flesh and muscle around his shoulder blade. A geyser of 
blood was hurled into the air like wine when the sword cut right 
through to the right armpit; hacking Yagami&#39;s arm off. Hibuki 
gave a surprised expression as Shiki jumped backwards and Yagami 
skidded back in pain. The chopped limb was hurled into the air 
along with the blood and scraps of flesh that had been cut 
loose. It fell to the ground with a slap. Its fingers were still 
twitching.  

Hibuki spoke to himself as he glared at all this. &quot;She used 
Shunhenkou to switch places with one of the shuriken... just 
like she did with me... what a skillful and sudden technique.&quot;

Yagami stopped himself in a crouched position, gripping the 
bloody hump where his right arm had once been, blood leaking 
from both his mouth and his wound. Shiki landed in a similar 
position... but with a bright and devious smile on her face. She 
kept Miyuki drawn but let her guard down a little. One of 
Yagami&#39;s limbs had been dismembered. There was no way he could 
fight now. 

&quot;So...&quot; She uttered, &quot;...Not quite as powerful as you made 
yourself out to be, are you? Well that&#39;s just too bad, you 
conceited son of a bitch. The Six Orochi are over. Zanmaru-san 
and Ryoko-san are dead. Hibuki-san is beaten. You&#39;re beaten. And 
soon the same will happen to Setsuki-san and the remaining Sixth 
Orochi. Face it. It&#39;s over. Your life and that of 
Hirotsugu-yarou.&quot;

&quot;...You may indeed be more powerful than the other Orochi...&quot; 
Yagami&#39;s furious, animalistic red eyes looked up at her. They 
were filled with glorious hate and an insatiable rage, &quot;...But 
you could not hope to grasp the depths of my power... kunoichi 
of Morioka. You are already losing.&quot;

Shiki spat. &quot;I say you&#39;re full of it! You&#39;re done! It&#39;s all 
over! Admit defeat and surrender! You couldn&#39;t hope to kill me 
now. Not with just one arm to your name.&quot;

After hearing that; Yagami stood upright. With a fresh smile on 
his face, darkened in look by the blood that dripped from the 
right corner of his lips. &quot;...Do you really believe that I need 
more than one arm to defeat the likes of you? You have 
underestimated the Six Orochi for the last time, girl. Time to 
learn just how precious the properties of my blood are.&quot;

With his remaining arm; Yagami made the two-fingered sign of the 
shinobi again. He steeled himself and kept his dark red eyes on 
the Burning Kunoichi, Shiki. His expression remained calm and in 
control. But both Shiki and Hibuki could feel that a great 
generation of Chi that was throbbing inside of him now. Shiki 
scowled as she felt his Chi. It was naturally quiet. But in some 
ways it felt primal and rabid. Almost... beastly in nature. A 
smoky brown aura of spirit fire began to surround the one-armed 
man as he closed his eyes and focused that Chi of his. It was 
enormous. Hibuki felt a chill pass down his spine from feeling 
that spiritual power for himself. He had heard from Setsuki and 
Hirotsugu that he was extraordinarily powerful... but he never 
knew that Yagami was in possession of such frenzied Chi energy. 
To master such control over that power... no wonder Yagami was a 
blood descendant of that amazing family of old... 

Now Yagami was surrounded totally by his smouldering russet Chi 
Force. His eyes reopened. But rather than the previous tint of 
red they had... the colour had collapsed into purest white. So 
vacant and still. But so many ways... very threatening. Yagami 
aborted the two-finger sign and reached around to his back with 
his one remaining arm. It gripped the thin shaft of his glaive. 
Then his whole body began to lull backwards. Like he was 
falling. Shiki&#39;s bright green eyes widened with alarm as she 
watched Yagami fall backwards toward the ground beneath him. But 
rather than fall over, his firm muscled torso was swallowed into 
the image of his shadow on the ground. The animal shinobi had 
actually fallen into his own shadow... vanishing from sight. 
Shiki blinked furiously. She looked around for him. Above, to 
the left and to the right. Even behind. She couldn&#39;t see him... 
anywhere. What on earth was this? Some form of teleportation? 
Had Yagami ran away? Hibuki was asking himself the same 
question. Until he saw something unusual about Shiki&#39;s shadow. 
All was normal at first but then it began to grow in size. 
Larger than normal. Completely out of proportion with Shiki&#39;s 
body. And then spiky brown hair began to rise up from Shiki&#39;s 
shadow. Followed by the whole head. Yagami&#39;s head. 

He knew that technique. It was Kagetoho (Shadow Walk). The 
sacred ability to move through shadows. One of those fabled 
skills invented by that legendary family... and now Shiki was in 
danger because of it! Hibuki called to her urgently. &quot;Yui-san! 
Behind you!&quot;

The girl heard the call and the quickly sensed the danger. She 
turned around slightly to see one-armed Yagami rising up from 
her own shadow to attack her with Mikazuki Satsujinki. He thrust 
it forcefully at her and Shiki scrabbled to avoid it. The curved 
moon edge then cut straight at her. Through the fabric of the 
clothing at her waist. Blood spurted from the gash when Shiki 
jumped backwards to get away. She landed with a slide, while 
Yagami shot up from her large shadow (which had remained in 
place even though Shiki was nowhere near it) with a mighty, 
blurred jump. Yagami&#39;s swift body bounded through the air like a 
gale wind, and twirled the glaive around him with one hand, 
swooping down at startled Shiki.

&quot;Kagayaku Mangetsu Zan!&quot;
(Kagayaku Full Moon Slash!)

The attack came so fast that Shiki couldn&#39;t have dodged it. No 
matter how much she would have wanted to. Yagami blew by her 
like an eagle. And a bright burst of light filled that icy room 
from the strike. One swift hit slashed open the clothing over 
her shoulder blade. And cut so deep that it hacked into her bone 
tissue. Shiki screamed painfully and grabbed hold of her 
shoulder, collapsing to her knees. Her gripping hand was soon 
soiled with her own red blood; while her body felt the weight of 
the pain. Yagami landed from his swooping attack on two stable 
feet. Retaining his cool glance and his body still burning with 
his dusty gold spirit fire. But he didn&#39;t stop to admire his 
work. He attached Mikazuki Satsujinki to his back. Then went 
into his side pocket and pulled out a kunai knife. He then 
looked over at his right. There was a slab of ice that had 
become disjointed with the rest of the melting frost. It was 
casting a shadow on the ground beneath it. Yagami swiftly threw 
the kunai at the shadow. And the speedy weapon passed through it 
like a stone through water. Hibuki didn&#39;t know what that meant 
until he heard Shiki scream again. He looked over and saw the 
girl&#39;s face twist with pain. And also saw a bloody patch at the 
small of her back. A kunai was lodged inside it. The same one 
that Yagami had thrown through the shadow. He had attacked her 
through her own shadow again. Shiki dropped her sword and 
reached back with a trembling hand. It gripped the kunai that 
was impaling her. Then she winced as she ripped it out of her 
back. The girl then looked over at the silent Yagami. He was... 
amazing. She hadn&#39;t even seen him throw that kunai. But this awe 
was far out shadowed by her worry. Not only could she not keep 
up with the guy... but he was stronger and apparently more 
skilled that she was. Even with only one arm on him. 

Shiki was now struggling to speak from the pain. &quot;Who... are 
you...?&quot;

Hibuki could answer that. Even though that was not his 
intention. &quot;So it is true. What Setsuki-san and Genryukai-sama 
said about you is true after all, Yagami-san. You truly are a 
blood descendant of the legendary Kagayaku Family. I didn&#39;t want 
to believe it... but your mastery of Kagetoho, the foremost 
skill of the Kuro-houhou-jutsu (Art of the Black Way) proves 
it...&quot;

Shiki was uninformed about all this. &quot;W-What are you... talking 
about...?&quot;

&quot;...The Kagayaku Family,&quot; Though it was a great struggle, Hibuki 
managed to stand up. He grit his teeth and then pulled out the 
shuriken that Shiki had thrown into his stomach. It was painful 
but he kept his reaction under control enough to speak, &quot;...An 
ancient family that had once been one of the leading members of 
the Tengu Kokomaru. Which was a union of only the most powerful 
ninja clans; who wanted greatly to usurp power over any Shogun 
who happened to be ruling Japan at their time. The Tengu 
Kokomaru never succeeded in this aim. And after hundreds of 
years as a unit... their apparently unbreakable unanimity began 
to fade. A period of internal fighting set into the Tengu 
Kokomaru. It all reached a bloody head when the Kagayaku Family 
invented a brutal Ninjutsu art for the purpose of defending 
themselves from rival families. It was a style that tapped into 
the forbidden black arts. Kuro-houhou-jutsu. And that form of 
Ninjutsu gave the Kagayaku a power that made even the Shogun 
tremble. But the strength of those skills gave rise to deep 
waves of fear, envy and hatred amongst both shinobi low-class 
and shinobi elite. The remaining clans of the Tengu Kokomaru 
turned their fang on the Kagayaku...&quot;

Yagami took the time to speak. &quot;...And we were slaughtered. Men, 
women and children. All of my ancestors were butchered like 
pigs. All to stamp out our great power from the face of 
existence. The Tengu Kokomaru ostensibly wiped my people from 
the face of the earth. But there were some who survived. To pass 
their skills on through the ages. Until those skills became 
engraved into our very DNA. I am a modern-day descendant of the 
Kagayaku.&quot;

Shiki was thrown from all this. She had never even heard of it 
all before. Kagayaku? Tengu Kokomaru? There were so many shinobi 
legends active in this world. Ones that she was in the dark 
about. Was this the factor that gave Yagami his great power? If 
he really was... so strong... did Shiki even stand a chance? 
Both Shiki and Hibuki remained silent. But gasped in utter shock 
when they saw what Yagami did next. The young man walked over to 
the left slowly. Towards his dismembered arm. He stopped, 
crouched down, and the picked up the chopped off arm with his 
remaining one. Then held the sliced arm against its former 
socket. He pressed the two together. Skin, bone, muscle and 
nerves began to regenerate and link up to the dead arm. Until it 
had been completely reattached. Yagami then released his right 
arm and clenched the hand of it into a fist. Good as new. 

Shiki&#39;s eyes were wide with shock. She was so shocked that she 
didn&#39;t notice that Hibuki was standing next to her. &quot;...Did he 
just... reattach his arm...?&quot;

The Ice Shinobi, Uchida Hibuki, sighed. &quot;...The great power I 
was warned of. Yagami-san truly is a descendant of the Kagayaku. 
We cannot defeat him. Not even if we attacked him together.&quot;

Yagami looked over at the two. &quot;...Hibuki-san. I never did trust 
you. Hirotsugu-sama suspected that you might be still be working 
with Genryukai-san... but he put those concerns aside for the 
good of the Six Orochi. We should have known better than to 
think you would be loyal.&quot; 

Hibuki made the two-finger sign and crouched down, pressing his 
weakening hand into Shiki&#39;s back. &quot;...If you really believed 
that I would side with a power-hungry maniac like your master 
then you&#39;re as much of a lunatic as he is. We might not be a 
match for you now, Yagami-san... but we&#39;ll be back for you and 
Hirotsugu-yarou. You can tell him that from me.&quot;

A cold wind suddenly blew into that room. Even though there were 
no doors. Ice and wind surrounded both Hibuki and Shiki. One 
that surrounded them so fully that it obscured them from vision. 
That cold wind then whirled upwards like a tornado and burst 
open in a flash. But Hibuki and Shiki were gone. Yagami shook 
his head slowly. They had gotten away. But they were no match 
for him. 

...No one person could stand against the power of the Kagayaku.
