<h1>All Girls School (part 103 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch102.html">Back to Part 102</a><pre>&quot;Ambivalence&quot;

As Allie stood patiently behind her mourning girlfriend, she was forced 
to reconcile with all the good things she still had. Her father was 
still alive, at least&#151;not only that, but he still took care of his 
unruly daughter, even in the worst moments, and she had been through 
plenty of those&#151;and her mother, while clearly not a part of her life 
anymore, was at least still alive, if not far away. Corona&#39;s parents 
were gone, taken from her by terrible means&#151;first an automobile 
accident, then insanity&#151;and all she had left was her brother. Well, 
scratch that; now she had a loving girlfriend, and at least two teachers 
she could confide in.

The pain was still fresh on Marcos&#39; soul. She had learned to let go of 
her father&#39;s death over the years, but a mother in a mad house was 
something else. Whenever she had visited, the deranged woman didn&#39;t even 
recognize her own daughter, and screamed so loud that poor Corona cried. 
Maybe then, it was for the best that she was gone, at peace with herself 
and living eternally with her husband. Of course, that left their 
children to wallow through the muck on their own, but at least Corona 
had someone she could love.

&quot;Allie,&quot; she whispered, kneeling by the two graves, &quot;you are so lucky to 
have such a good father. I truly envy you. Sometimes I wish you&#39;d give 
him more credit. He gives up so much for you.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; grumbled the girl formerly known as Furious Hail. She 
sighed, preferring to stand, and shifted weight on her feet. &quot;Look, I 
treat the guy a lot better now than I used to, right? I mean, he&#39;s 
always gonna be a pain in the neck, but at least now he&#39;s gotten off my 
case.&quot;

&quot;He was only like that because he cared.&quot;

&quot;Right. And next you&#39;ll say that he&#39;s only off my case because I have so 
many people looking out for me, right?&quot;

&quot;Precisely.&quot; Corona stood up, rubbed her legs to get the stiffness out, 
and took her girlfriend&#39;s pale hand. She loved Allie dearly, but 
sometimes... &quot;Look, I&#39;m only telling you this because of the hard life 
I&#39;ve led. I just think it&#39;s ridiculous for a daughter to feel that way 
about her own father. Your mother I can understand, and you have every 
right to hate her for leaving you, but...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate my dad,&quot; Allie insisted, brushing aside her blonde hair. 
&quot;The guy&#39;s improved, I can tell you that much. And I am glad he&#39;s dating 
again. At least this time he found a woman of quality.&quot;

&quot;Mrs. Keys, right?&quot; Both girls smiled. Janet was one of the people they 
knew they could go to if they had any problems. Since she had never been 
given the chance to be a real mother, the school&#39;s art teacher took it 
upon herself to act matronly to the whole campus, even going so far as 
to take an abused young mother-to-be into her own home. If Janet Keys 
was dating Allie&#39;s father&#151;and if they were serious&#151;then Blair might have 
a good chance of getting a stepmother in the future. But that was a 
long, long way off.

&quot;Hey,&quot; said Corona excitedly, &quot;if Mrs. Keys marries your dad, you and 
Jocelyn will be sisters! You&#39;ll be an aunt!&quot;

&quot;I never thought of it that way,&quot; Allie murmured. &quot;I mean, I barely know 
that girl Joss, and it&#39;s not like we&#39;d be like best friends or anything 
if we were forced to live under the same roof, but...it would be nice to 
have a sister. I always wanted one. But I don&#39;t know how good I&#39;d be.&quot; 
Corona grinned and played with the girl&#39;s yellowy locks.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re in self-doubt,&quot; she crooned. Blair snorted 
and waved Corona&#39;s hand away. She turned around quickly, nearly forcing 
the other girl to follow.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get out of here. Graveyards just aren&#39;t my thing.&quot;

&quot;Oh? I thought you&#39;d be right at home in them.&quot;

&quot;Not anymore,&quot; she said seriously. Corona saw that look in her eyes, the 
look of quiet pride at how much she had changed over the months, and 
smiled softly. She kissed dear sweet Allie and nuzzled her neck.

&quot;Yeah...I hate them too. Let&#39;s get something to eat&#151;your treat.&quot;

&quot;Huh? Uh...sure.&quot;

......

The past was all in a haze to Zane as she woke up. First came the 
knowledge that yes, she was naked, her bosom exposed proudly in the 
sunlight, her stomach curved and rumbling with hunger. Next came the 
realization that she was still a little sore from that game a few days 
ago&#151;not the one against Laudendale, she had gotten over it and was 
looking to settle into happy retirement. She couldn&#39;t have a 
mud-and-blood fetish forever; she needed to concentrate on her line of 
eccentric designer clothes. With a yawn, she recalled the more recent 
game she had played: the exhibition, the one where a score wasn&#39;t kept, 
the one where the Stanton Badgers faced off against Rodgerson&#39;s Rhinos, 
the unofficial game where she and Petra finally got to square off.

What a strange day that had been! Zane had actually ran into her Russian 
rival earlier that same day, in the same outlet store no less. She had 
just been browsing the &quot;competition&quot;, and didn&#39;t expect to see the 
muscular, haughty blonde. When they did meet, a look of contempt and 
malice swung between their sharp eyes, and a growl might&#39;ve popped up.

&quot;You disappoint me,&quot; Petra had sighed, her first words. &quot;I didn&#39;t think 
you could lose to those awful Diamonds. And yet here you are, a mere one 
point behind, standing around in this pit while the championship title 
goes to somebody else. You are not worth my time.&quot;

&quot;And what about you, ya vodka-swilling pig?&quot; she retorted. &quot;Last I 
heard, your school got beat too. I don&#39;t hear you making a speech as you 
take that trophy. So what gives?&quot;

&quot;It was a technicality,&quot; Petra replied in disgust. &quot;They were cheating. 
My team was like a hoard of Valkyries swooping down on our foes. Our 
goalie was like a great wall. We moved like dolphins across a river of 
green.&quot;

&quot;Ahuh. And yet you lost.&quot;

&quot;You will be silent, Klein,&quot; snarled Petra, now almost shoving her face 
in Zane&#39;s nose. &quot;Just because we did not win, that does not excuse us 
from our duel. Remember, we were destined to struggle one last time 
before college. I will not be satisfied until we have a game.&quot;

&quot;Well we obviously can&#39;t stage a real one. I mean, I&#39;m up to the 
challenge, but what do you wanna do, get the two teams together and just 
go at it in the park?&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; purred the blonde, smirking wickedly. &quot;It&#39;s as good as we are 
going to get. But I hear your team is a little handicapped. Didn&#39;t one 
of your players try to kill herself?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, she heals real fast.&quot;

&quot;And didn&#39;t one of yours just give birth?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s been awhile since then. She can play.&quot;

&quot;I hear one of your goalies has tuberculosis.&quot;

&quot;That or asthma,&quot; shrugged Klein. &quot;Look, if you don&#39;t want to fight 
against my team and our, uh, &#145;handicapped players&#39;, just say so&#151;because 
these intimidation tactics aren&#39;t going to work.&quot; Petra laughed out 
loud, and told her rival she had no fear whatsoever. The two shook hands 
on it, and a time and place was set. The Badgers were only too happy to 
have one last chance to fight against the Rhinos, but the game ended up 
being more about fun than a serious rivalry. Nobody kept score, and so 
it looked like their grudge would have to be settled another day. Maybe 
next year.

A few days had passed since then. Aintzane found herself hanging around 
Petra more. Even though she was irritating, stuck-up, egotistical, 
sharp-tongued, and harsh, Petra could be pretty cool, and even Zane had 
to admit that the woman was sexy. Her blonde hair had almost been 
totally shorn away (some religious thing the team did just before the 
season started), but it was growing back and made her look tough, if not 
desirable. While they were off socializing, the rumors about the two of 
them secretly having a thing for each other floated through Klein&#39;s 
mind, and though she whisked them away at first, there was a part of her 
too curious to put it out of her thoughts for long.

So, in short, they bedded each other one night. In the morning, Aintzane 
woke up, naked and bathed in sunshine from Petra&#39;s window. The other 
woman was off showering; Zane wondered if she&#39;d mind company. Only one 
way to find out.

......

Rozalia was stoked! After sneaking around on the internet, she 
discovered something worth getting so excited about: there was going to 
be an Anime, Games, and Sci-fi convention held not very far from where 
she lived, and she had just enough money saved up from her weekly 
allowance for one ticket. The only real problem, aside from 
transportation, was who to cosplay as.

Mira&#39;s anime club discussed it, of course, but Miklos didn&#39;t attend that 
meeting&#151;she had been grounded that day. Feeling sociable the next day, 
she walked up and spoke with her fellow &quot;Geek Goddess&quot;, the lovely (and 
motherly) Jocelyn McKeough, about what had transpired during her 
absence. Miss Keeping had volunteered to drive some of the girls to the 
convention, given that they had their parents&#39; permission, so that was 
transportation taken care of.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about cosplaying,&quot; Jocelyn told her. &quot;Most of us will just 
go as we are. I think I&#39;ll pull out my old Selphie Tilmitt costume from 
the closet, since I went as her for Halloween a few years back and I 
kinda resemble her.&quot;

&quot;You really do look more like Terra Branford,&quot; Rozy told her. &quot;So, uh, 
what about Erica? Is she going?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Joss laughed, &quot;she doesn&#39;t really &#145;get&#39; these sorts of things. As 
meek as she is, she&#39;s really more of a jock than a geek. You know how it 
is.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she admitted. &quot;But I still don&#39;t know who I&#39;ll go as. I 
mean, this is the first convention I&#39;ve actually been to, so I want to 
go as somebody. Who do I look like to you?&quot; Jocelyn studied Rozalia 
carefully, using her nerd&#39;s eyes to filter through games and animes for 
any possible matches. Rozy was 5&#39;9&quot; and weighed an even six-score 
pounds, effectively giving her a tall, lanky build. She was fairly pale 
and had strong legs, and had dark green eyes that could sometimes give 
off a reddish glow. The girl was a natural blonde, but changed her hair 
to match the seasons; this month, it was back to its full golden glory. 
Rozalia had forest-shaded fatigues and a short-sleeved shirt, but 
typically wore military surplus clothing.

&quot;I&#39;d like to say somebody from the Gundam series, but one doesn&#39;t come 
to mind,&quot; Joss told her. &quot;What about Aya Brea from Parasite Eve?&quot;

&quot;You think I could pull her off?&quot; Jocelyn grinned.

&quot;Or Rosa Farril from Final Fantasy four.&quot;

&quot;Oh, because of my...yeah, ha-ha.&quot; Actually, dressing as Aya didn&#39;t 
sound like a bad idea. Miklos had an elementary grasp of military-issue 
weaponry, and could probably fake a police officer better than anyone 
due to her uncle&#39;s upbringing (he was ex-marine). Rozy didn&#39;t shine to 
the idea of wearing contacts, especially since her eyes got hurt in 
normal light anyway, but she vowed to at least give the whole thing a 
try.

&quot;What about Geek Goddess number two?&quot; she murmured&#151;or was it number one? 
It was so hard keeping track of these things.

&quot;Oh, Mira? She told me she&#39;s going as a miko, a shrine maiden.&quot;

&quot;So she&#39;s really coming along?&quot; Jocelyn confirmed it. Just great. A 
perfectly good day out having fun, now ruined by that strange dyke. Why 
did that woman pester Rozy so much, anyway? She hadn&#39;t done anything 
wrong; she had nothing against the Dutch, nor even against lesbians, 
disgusted though she was at the sight of their public displays of 
affection. Maybe if she bothered trying to understand Mira...oh, but 
what was the point? Rozalia just didn&#39;t want to do it.

......

With soccer now over, Leena was handing the girls more health 
assignments than physical education exercises. Dr. Andrews would be 
fully responsible for teaching the health classes next year, but for 
now, she assisted Leena inside the classroom. The good doctor had a 
great knowledge of her profession and pushed the girls to their academic 
limits, but she did it without any excitement or enthusiasm at all; she 
was as professionally cold as they came. And Alexandra Blair did not 
like her at all.

&quot;Why can&#39;t Leena teach these classes?&quot; she whispered to Gabrielle. &quot;I&#39;d 
much rather have her than this robot.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, tell me about it. But think about poor Katt. She ain&#39;t got 
nothin&#39; nice to stare at.&quot;

&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; whispered Ana Lu from behind. Even without looking 
at her, it was clear she was ogling the handsome woman. Allie sighed.

&quot;So what&#39;s the deal with our gym classes now? Are they going to be once 
every other day now?&quot;

&quot;I have no idea,&quot; replied Gabrielle. &quot;Ask Hero; she&#39;s got all the 
contacts.&quot;

&quot;I would, but she&#39;s kind of on the other side of the room.&quot;

&quot;Well, ask the good doctor yourself then.&quot; Allie rolled her eyes and 
raised her hand. Dr. Andrews pointed to her once she turned 
around&#151;&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Um, Miss Andrews&#151;&quot;

&quot;Doctor Andrews, please.&quot; Cringe.

&quot;Right. Uh, Dr. Andrews, do you know what our health and P.E. schedules 
will be like next year? Will it be every other day, or what?&quot;

&quot;Good question. Let me illustrate.&quot; Andrews drew the schedule on the 
board: one week would have gym on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and 
health classes Tuesdays and Thursdays. The next week, the two would 
alternate&#151;gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays, health on the other three, and 
then another alteration.

&quot;So there&#39;s definitely going to be a health class integrated soon, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I was just recently approved to be the instructor.&quot;

&quot;So who&#39;ll be the school doctor?&quot;

&quot;I will, naturally,&quot; she stated. She saw the confused look on Allie&#39;s 
face and explained: &quot;I&#39;ll have aides, of course. We&#39;ve been hiring some 
new staff members.&quot;

&quot;(Hopefully she won&#39;t shag&#39;em on the side,)&quot; muttered Ivory. The girls 
tittered, and Andrews raised an eyebrow of warning.

&quot;Do you have something to say, Miss Tran?&quot;

&quot;No ma&#39;am,&quot; replied the imp. Andrews snorted.

&quot;I could have sworn I heard something.&quot;

&quot;Um, no, just sighing.&quot; The other eyebrow raised, but that was the 
extent of the doctor&#39;s attention. She returned to her lecture, and the 
girls groaned in frustration, none more so than Allie. She didn&#39;t want 
to be a doctor&#151;hell, she had only signed up for gym because she wanted 
to stay in shape&#151;so why&#39;d she have to endure the prattling of this 
boring old drone? If Leena were teaching, the class would be a lot more 
exciting and interactive. Leena knew just how to get her students 
interested in the subject, and she treated them more like friends than 
students. Why so many people flocked to Dr. Andrews&#39; bed was a complete 
mystery to the former Furious one.

When health class finally ended, Allie waved to her friends and ventured 
to her locker, wondering if Corona had slipped a love letter inside. 
Since the two girls only shared one class, they had to find other ways 
to communicate, oftentimes taking to writing letters and passing them 
along in some fashion. Allie&#39;s last letter, sent just after a grueling 
test in Madsen&#39;s class, had been on the steamy side, so maybe Corona 
would reply in kind. There was a letter waiting for her when she opened 
her locker, but it wasn&#39;t quite as sexual as she thought it&#39;d be.

&quot;Dear Princess Alexandra,

&quot;Just be glad I read your letter alone! (wink) I&#39;ll see what I can do 
about your &#145;requests&#39;, but first let me ask you something. You said you 
didn&#39;t know Jocelyn very well, but how would you like it if I told you 
she was going somewhere for the weekend, and you could go along too&#151;you 
know, to get better acquainted. I mean, the way things are going now, 
you&#39;ll be sisters before the year&#39;s over. You may as well get to know 
her. Talk to me in Keys&#39; class; I&#39;d like to come along too. Let&#39;s make 
it a date!

&quot;Love always, your Corona&quot;

&quot;Probably that convention I heard so much about,&quot; Allie mumbled to 
herself. She put the letter in a box, stashed some of her books away, 
pulled others out, made sure she looked nice, and went off to her next 
class. Whether she and Jocelyn were honestly going to be stepsisters or 
not was left up to debate (Allie knew that Joss was Keys&#39; foster 
daughter; she just humored everybody), but a date with Corona always 
perked her interest. Anywhere was better than a graveyard, at least.

.........

Rozalia Miklos was spared the pleasantries of knowing who Furious Hail 
was, so when she heard rumor that this person was coming along with them 
to the convention, she reacted with blas&eacute; inquiry. A few people told her 
the old rumors&#151;that Hail was a druggy, a raver, a bully and a load of 
trouble&#151;but some were a little more up-to-date and filled her in on what 
Allie was really like. Rozy dismissed it once she got the lowdown&#151;she 
was actually more concerned about Mira. At best, the Dutch redhead was 
unpredictable, but in the right light, she seemed loveable&#151;until she got 
within range of a blonde. Miklos had personally felt the full fury of 
Mira&#39;s teasing and tasteless jokes, and couldn&#39;t understand why somebody 
who hated golden-haired girls so much could also be so infatuated with 
them.

&quot;Probably one of those romance rules in anime and RPGs,&quot; Farrah told her 
on the ride there. &quot;You know, how the person usually shows a lack of 
interest or discord towards another person later on, but somewhere along 
the line, they become really close? I think it&#39;s just Mira&#39;s very 
immature way of telling you she likes you.&quot;

&quot;Eww,&quot; Rozy cringed, &quot;you mean like it was back in grade school, when 
people used to tease or make fun of people they liked?&quot;

&quot;Exactly. Mira&#39;s putting lizards in your lunch and tacks on your seat. 
If you want my opinion, the whole thing disgusts me.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re on the same page there,&quot; Rozy murmured. Ah, good old Farrah, 
always great for an intellectual discussion. There was no danger of her 
flaunting her romantic side, or suddenly jerking into Sapphism, or 
showing any sort of belligerent activity, at least not to Rozy. Miklos 
felt very comfortable around the other girl, and considered her one of 
the few friends she had been lucky enough to find at Stanton.

&quot;So, like, you&#39;re not a lesbian, are you?&quot; asked Kwong, draping her arms 
over her seat, looking directly at Rozy. Miklos adamantly shook her 
head.

&quot;I had a bad experience online once&#151;case of mistaken identity. It still 
scares the pants off of me.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t envy you that,&quot; murmured Kwong. &quot;I never had any experiences at 
all, not even when Ivory and I shared a bed when we slept over. I&#39;m 
thankful she never tried to cop a feel while we were asleep!&quot;

&quot;You trusted her?&quot; Farrah grinned arrogantly.

&quot;What can I say, the dyke owes me big time. She&#39;s in too much debt to 
try anything, and she never goes for the girls that are really straight. 
Not the type to go after those, thank God.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so she&#39;s not one of &#145;those&#39; lesbians.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot;

&quot;And I suppose Mira is,&quot; murmured Rozy to herself. She sighed and leaned 
back&#151;this is just perfect, I&#39;ve got a weirdo dyke running after me with 
a strange fixation for blondes. I should really dye my hair again&#151;and 
Farrah turned around to talk to another girl. It wouldn&#39;t be long before 
the convention was in sight...

......

Aintzane had dated, bedded, and even loved plenty of young women during 
her brief life as a lesbian, but none made her feel more electric, more 
alive, and more miserable than her rival, her lover, her other self, 
Petra Rominostikov. A week had passed since their courtship began&#151;it was 
around early May, and soon the end of the school year would draw upon 
them&#151;and already, Aintzane felt giddy as lovers should, and gloomy as 
slaves ought to. Petra was not just the yin to her yang; she was yin and 
yang all at once, the essential Lilith, and Zane loved and hated her 
deeply.

Perhaps, though, the hatred and misery outnumbered the love and bliss 
she felt. Petra was unkind to her; she mistreated Zane, stood her up for 
long periods of time, and neglected to see her or even call for days on 
end. When they were together, she teased Zane mercilessly&#151;not a lover&#39;s 
tease, but the taunting of a heartless enemy, one intent on bringing her 
soul crashing down. Klein would&#39;ve ended it in disgust if not for those 
few happy moments when Petra was everything she had ever wanted in a 
lover and more&#151;and the sex was always, always good, no matter what mood 
they were both in.

It was a terrible cycle. Aintzane knew she had to break free, but every 
time she got the guts to cut Petra off like a diseased limb, the Russian 
would ooze charm and affection, melting her lover into submissive jelly. 
After that, Petra could be as mean as she wished, even cruel, and would 
only change once her lover solidified and believed that this time, she 
would do the right thing. It was a terrible cycle, and poor Zane was 
powerless to break free. She had never felt love to this degree, even 
mixed in with the muck and sludge, and was afraid she&#39;d never get 
another chance if she ended it.

One day she actually had the courage to walk outside and forget she was 
ever linked to that loathsome, wonderful woman&#151;no, no, just loathsome. 
Oh, but the way she stared at Zane with those piercing blue eyes&#151;no, no, 
she was evil and spiteful. But so wonderful in bed&#151;well, there was no 
argument there. Her thoughts went back and forth like that, fighting 
themselves until Zane had to sit down and let the schizophrenia pour out 
like air from a ripped balloon. Sit down until brain stops hurting: the 
best method she knew to calm herself.

Vairocana Knox didn&#39;t believe in fate, but she did believe in duty and 
obligations. Her mothers had asked her to go to the store to pick 
something up, and since it was such a nice day, she decided to walk the 
whole way, choosing the scenic route instead. There was still no getting 
away from sirens, smog from cars, and the omnipresent rabble of moronic 
fools that always seemed to litter her every destination, but at least 
she had some greenery to distract herself. Vai was about halfway to the 
store when she noticed, sitting on a bench in the distance, the former 
Captain of the Stanton Badgers, moping all by herself. Coincidence?

If anybody knew the full pleasures and pains of a solo angst-fest, it 
was Vai. Aintzane was typically an upbeat person, if not downright 
eccentric, and to see her looking like this was unsettling. Normally, 
Vai would&#39;ve walked right past the woman and ignored her&#151;after all, Zane 
had tried flirting with her twice, both on special occasions&#151;but then 
she remembered how many times she wished people would come up to her and 
say hello during those long periods of loneliness. Since her mothers 
didn&#39;t seem to need those groceries immediately, Vai approached the 
younger woman and cleared her throat.

&quot;Uhh, hey there Zane. Mind if I sit down?&quot; Klein looked up and smiled. 
Vai! One of the girls she had a crush on&#151;and still did, and for a good 
reason. She could pass as a gypsy with her naturally-tan skin and 
obsidian hair, and there was something about droopy lonely girls than 
Zane couldn&#39;t resist. She moved over so Vai could wedge herself in, and 
went from down to up in a moment.

&quot;By what do I have the honor of this visit?&quot; she asked politely. Knox 
shrugged.

&quot;I just saw you and you looked...lonely. I hate being lonely. I&#39;m always 
wasting my time wondering why I&#39;m like that, hoping that somebody will 
come up and relieve me. So I guess I&#39;m...sympathetic to people like 
that.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Aintzane blushed prettily and scooted closer. &quot;You were really 
concerned for me? That&#39;s so sweet.&quot;

&quot;I just thought you could use some company, and I know what that&#39;s like, 
so who better?&quot; Who indeed, Klein thought to herself. Vai was even 
prettier wearing springtime clothes...

&quot;Want me to tell you my story?&quot; she asked. Vai felt like she was in the 
mood, and assured Klein that being so quiet all the time left her with a 
remarkable capacity to listen. Aintzane then spilled out everything to 
this girl who was still a perfect mystery to her&#151;everything. More 
specifically, she told the whole Petra story, including the whole 
confusing love/hate cycle. She left nothing out; it was like Zane was 
talking to her closest friend. Maybe...

&quot;Maybe all I really needed was somebody to give a rat&#39;s ass about what&#39;s 
going through my mind,&quot; she resigned with a melancholy sigh. &quot;Somebody 
to listen, y&#39;know? That&#39;s the best cure, I think. A listener. It does a 
hell of a lot more good than somebody that butts in every two seconds.&quot; 
She looked over at Vai, noticed she was still quiet and attentive, and 
grinned cheekily. &quot;Um, you can butt in now. I&#39;m done.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; She laughed quietly and took a big breath. &quot;Zane...uh, may I call 
you that?&quot;

&quot;Most everyone does; that or Klein. But...you know...I really hate that 
name. My mother wanted that name for me, but my father disagreed. He 
changed it when she passed away.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; she added with a pretty smile. &quot;She died giving birth to me, 
like I was too much to handle. Pops called me Aintzane to honor my 
mother&#39;s wish, like he felt bad for arguing. He was going to name me 
Rochelle, so that&#39;s where my middle name comes in&#151;sort of.&quot;

&quot;Rochelle...&quot; Vai whispered it and smiled. So, there was another thing 
they had in common. Knox really wished she had been given another 
name&#151;maybe Veronica. Yeah, that was such a pretty name. Better than the 
one she had now! &quot;Anyway,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I was wondering if I could 
make a suggestion. I know we&#39;re not close or anything, but if I may be 
allowed to put my two cents in...&quot;

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; gestured Klein. &quot;And you know, I&#39;d like to be your friend. 
You interest me. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s lots to know about Vai Knox.&quot;

You have no idea, she was tempted to say. But she merely chuckled weakly 
and went on.

&quot;Well, if you want my opinion, you should&#39;ve broken up with her a long 
time ago. I don&#39;t know you that well, but I know enough to know that you 
don&#39;t deserve that kind of treatment. Nobody does. Why are you even 
around her if you don&#39;t like her?&quot; Zane became timid and shrunk back, 
afraid of the answers.

&quot;She&#39;s not bad all the time. She can be really sweet sometimes. And she 
loves me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, &#145;sometimes&#39; being the key word here. The way you said it, I 
thought you were talking about your mortal enemy, not just another 
person.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s nice,&quot; Zane defended, not five minutes after explaining how 
loathsome Petra was.

&quot;No, she&#39;s not. Zane, she mistreats you and she&#39;s vile. She makes you 
feel bad about yourself and she&#39;s selfish. She doesn&#39;t even see you 
unless she wants to, and she manipulates you into feeling guilty if you 
grow a backbone. That&#39;s not what I call a healthy relationship, Klein. I 
call that a disaster waiting to happen.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but&#151;&quot;

&quot;No buts,&quot; Vai pointed sharply. &quot;Break up with her, today. As soon as 
possible.&quot;

&quot;...But what if&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, no buts. Do it today. All right? Just walk up and tell her it&#39;s 
over, you never want to see her again, and then...tell her to screw 
herself with a cactus or something.&quot; Zane snickered out of her funk, and 
with sad, weary eyes, promised Vai that she&#39;d do it.

&quot;I really appreciate this,&quot; she said, standing up to leave. &quot;It takes a 
lot of guts to do what you did. Only a real friend would give me that 
sort of advice. I really owe ya one, Vai.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take you up on that later,&quot; she noted, and watched as Zane 
disappeared into the horizon. Of course, Vai knew that the whole thing 
was none of her business, but...it made her feel a little more 
interactive when it came to the human population. Like...somebody still 
needed her and wanted her around. Remembering that she had groceries to 
buy, Vai picked herself up and was gone into the distance as well.

......

The feminine entourage was abuzz with excitement as they wandered into 
the convention center, every single one of them dressed like it was All 
Saint&#39;s Eve. Ms. Keeping wore a bluish-purple wig and walked around with 
a crisp smile, looking every bit the part of Misato Katsuragi of 
Evangelion; June was Subaru, as usual, but without Victoria there, the 
effect wasn&#39;t nearly so cute. Jocelyn was Selphie, just as she promised, 
and Farrah was Major Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, although 
decidedly not nearly as &quot;gifted&quot;. Hero and Ayanna cosplayed as Elma and 
Lucile, as usual; Mihoshi was the only person who didn&#39;t dress up, but 
she was also the only one that didn&#39;t need to, and Rozy noticed she was 
turning heads as she walked around looking like Aya Brea.

&quot;You look really sexy as a police officer,&quot; came a Dutch-coated voice 
from her side. Rozy&#39;s pale face turned red with anger as she tried 
ignoring Miko Mira. It became even harder when the peculiar girl put her 
arm around Rozy&#39;s shoulder like they were old buddies. &quot;I&#39;m so glad you 
came. I haven&#39;t been to a convention in years. This is only my second 
one in America. I didn&#39;t even have friends back then, so I can really 
appreciate the place now.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Rozy managed, lifting the girl&#39;s arm off. Mira looked 
beautiful in a kimono, but she had the bad taste to keep her hair color. 
If she had worn a wig or dyed it, she could&#39;ve passed being a shrine 
maiden much easier. &quot;Look,&quot; sighed Rozy, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I did to 
make you tease me like you do, but I wish you&#39;d stop.&quot; Mira pouted and 
put her arm back across Rozy&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;I tease you because I like you!&quot; she sang. &quot;Did my friends not say that 
I like blondes? And yet I must tease them, because they bring that sweet 
sexy ditzy nature upon themselves.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m none of those three,&quot; Rozy growled, her voice acidic. &quot;Now leave me 
alone.&quot;

&quot;No, no, let&#39;s be friends! I&#39;ll apologize, see! I didn&#39;t know you were 
so sensitive! Please, let me apologize!&quot; She then rambled off in 
Dutch&#151;probably an extended apology listing all the ways she&#39;d make up 
for harassing poor Rozalia&#151;and only stopped when the object of her 
twisted affections demanded it.

Not far away, Allie and Corona were chuckling at this latest 
development.

&quot;They&#39;re such a cute couple,&quot; said the blonde. Corona heartily agreed.

&quot;I hope they never get together. If they actually fall in love, they&#39;ll 
get boring. If they only play and pretend and flirt, they&#39;re always 
going to be exciting.&quot;

&quot;Ah, but the flirting shall only be one-way,&quot; Allie reminded her. &quot;Lest 
you forget, chica, our dear faux-Greek friend does not reciprocate. This 
be an unrequited love affair!&quot; Corona giggled even louder as her 
girlfriend put on a show, and finally burst out laughing when Allie 
started making faces to go along with her performance. Since neither one 
of them were that interested in conventions, they didn&#39;t dress up, 
leaving them in the minority. And so far, Allie had yet to say anything 
to her would-be foster stepsister.

&quot;It&#39;s not like we&#39;ll be related or anything,&quot; she said as the two of 
them walked through the crowds. &quot;I mean, Joss&#39;s mother is still alive, 
for heavens&#39; sake. I wouldn&#39;t have anything against being her friend, 
and I&#39;d certainly be happy if Mrs. Keys became my stepmother...&quot;

&quot;So go over there and befriend her,&quot; said Corona, giving her girlfriend 
a push. Jocelyn was in a medium-sized Final Fantasy booth, posing 
willingly with other characters from that franchise. Allie took a deep 
breath and marched over, more worried about the fanatical fans than the 
young mother. She managed to get Jocelyn&#39;s attention and pulled her 
away, guiding her to a quiet place. Corona knew it&#39;d be best to leave 
the two of them alone, and went away to scout out anything of interest. 
She didn&#39;t like anime, RPGs, or science-fiction any more than her lover 
did, but at least she could appreciate the endless works of art that 
went into them.

&quot;So what&#39;d you want to talk about?&quot; asked Jocelyn when they were alone. 
Allie let go of her hand and faltered.

&quot;Well, y&#39;know...your, uh, foster mother and my dad have been seeing each 
other a lot, and so...I thought it&#39;d be nice if we hung out a bit.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Joss knew where this was going; she had heard the rumors. &quot;Well, I 
guess so. Um...I gotta tell you, Alex, I&#39;m not real comfortable with the 
idea. I mean, I know you&#39;ve changed, but...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m still trying to get used to it myself. I just 
figured...&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; A pause. Both girls wrung their hands and fingers, anything to 
distract themselves from confronting each other. Finally, Allie sighed 
and waved her hair from her face.

&quot;So you like this sort of place?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, it&#39;s pretty cool. I guess you could call me a geek. I&#39;m not into 
the whole sci-fi thing, but I do like anime and role-playing games.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not really into it,&quot; Allie grunted. Joss gave her a big, warm 
smile.

&quot;Well, maybe I can get you addicted! It&#39;d be a great way for us to bond, 
and I&#39;m sure my mother would love to have you over for dinner.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me and the old man,&quot; muttered Blair foxily. She chuckled at the 
idea and figured an evening at the Keys residence would be a pretty nice 
way to spend her time. &quot;Well, sure, why not. I&#39;ll even stay over if you 
want. So...when, tonight?&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re going to be getting home late tonight, cuz&#39; of the 
convention. How about tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Tomorrow sounds good. Uh, so like, what ana-thingy are you going to be 
showing me?&quot;

&quot;Well, since you&#39;re unfamiliar with the whole thing, I&#39;ll go for the 
basics. Ever hear of Sailor Moon?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, the one where all the magical girls run around in skirts.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s pretty much the gist,&quot; laughed Joss. The two shook on it&#151;they 
weren&#39;t nearly comfortable with hugging, and probably wouldn&#39;t be for a 
long time&#151;and returned to the convention so their friends wouldn&#39;t 
wonder about their well-being. Allie resolved to spend the rest of the 
day with Jocelyn, and even took Corona along for the ride, even though 
the young Hispanic woman was clearly bored out of her mind.

......

Even though Mira was a pain in the neck, she had the good sense to 
apologize, and Rozalia had been enjoying herself too much to be in a bad 
mood. Besides, she knew she could be an ass herself, and her uncle sure 
wasn&#39;t required to forgive her rebellious nature. Mira gave her a pretty 
smile once she was absolved, and spent most of her time acting as Rozy&#39;s 
shadow, following her or else leading the way. Rozy knew she wanted 
friends, but...

Well, at least we have a whole lot in common, she reasoned to herself. 
If Mira hadn&#39;t gone and been a bully to me, we could&#39;ve been really 
close friends now. If that&#39;s her way of saying she likes me, though... 
Rozy shuddered at the idea, still remembering the repulsion she felt 
when she realized, long ago, when her old internet crush was in fact 
another girl. And now here was Mira, nearly slapping her in the face 
with the whole &quot;I&#39;m a dyke, I&#39;m proud of it, and I like you a whole lot&quot; 
deal.

Soon, though, it was hard to remember Mira being anything other than a 
nice, energetic, fun-loving woman. Rozalia forgot she had been a bully 
and a lesbian, and just saw her as a fellow lover of fantasy. It turned 
out they were both diehard Star Wars fans (Mira even wrote several 
stories, but admitted they were mostly femme-slashes), not to mention 
huge fanatics when it came to massive multiplayer online RPGs (they even 
exchanged emails and user names so they&#39;d be able to &quot;meet&quot; online), and 
they even liked most of the same video games. Soon they really were 
talking like old friends.

&quot;Have you ever played anything by tri-ace?&quot; asked Rozalia. Mira shook 
her head. &quot;Oh, man, you gotta! Especially Valkyrie Profile; that&#39;s like 
my favorite. You know about the whole Norse mythology thing, right? Well 
that game&#39;s sorta like it, only a little bit different.&quot;

&quot;So what is your favorite anime?&quot; Mira asked. Rozy was more of a 
role-player than an anime lover, but she answered &quot;Anything with the 
word &#145;Gundam&#39; in it.&quot; She even recognized the name of Lunamaria Hawke, 
the character Mira had dressed up for on Halloween. After a few more 
minutes of talking&#151;although it could&#39;ve been hours, with the way they 
were going&#151;Mira pulled Rozy aside and went into a more serious state of 
mind.

&quot;You know, the Prom is coming right up,&quot; she stated. &quot;I couldn&#39;t go last 
year because I was sick, and my parents thought I was too young, but 
when I asked them this time, they said I could go. It&#39;ll be my first 
time, so I&#39;d really love it if you could go with me.&quot; Rozy grimaced, 
giving Mira a weird look.

&quot;You mean like a date?&quot;

&quot;No, no&#151;if it makes you uncomfortable, no. Just to go with me, so I&#39;m 
not lonely.&quot;

&quot;Why not ask one of your other friends?&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#39;t like them as much,&quot; she answered, giving a classic 
smile. Even Rozalia couldn&#39;t help but turn red at that. &quot;Besides, we 
have a lot in common, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be right for me to go with 
anyone else. I will pay for it and everything, as a way of making up for 
being so insensitive. Please, it would mean so much to me.&quot; Mira took 
Rozy&#39;s hands and massaged them, begging with wholesome blue eyes that 
never really had any malice in them. Rozy wasn&#39;t sure&#151;Mira was a 
girl&#151;she wasn&#39;t gay&#151;they barely knew each other&#151;she didn&#39;t like dances 
and socials&#151;she never meant to go except for her senior year&#151;she was 
afraid to go regardless&#151;she wasn&#39;t sure&#151;and Mira was a girl.

&quot;Can I think about it?&quot; she whispered. Mira smiled and nodded.

&quot;Sure, of course. And this is not a date&#151;unless you want it to be!!&quot; She 
beamed happily, but poor Rozy was anything but pleased. That last 
comment really irritated her.

Crazy dyke... &quot;Not a date&quot; my ass!

But...it&#39;s what you wanted, isn&#39;t it? To get out there, make friends, go 
to socials...meet people who were just like you. And isn&#39;t Mira just 
like you?

I don&#39;t know. I need to think about it. Ugh, I hope she doesn&#39;t try 
anything funny if I say yes.

Yeah, that would be awful. We agree on that at least.

Right.

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; she repeated. &quot;But for now, I really want to 
check out that Star Trek booth!&quot;

&quot;Sure, lead on, buddy!&quot; Rozalia was unaccustomed to being called 
buddy&#151;but what the hey! She and Mira raced through the crowds, hand in 
hand, laughing and yelling for everyone to get out of their way. Good 
thing the convention security wasn&#39;t around...

.........

It was unusual for Vai to be the only person in the classroom when she 
stepped into science class, but it was also unusual for it to be so 
empty. The other students must&#39;ve been at lunch or something, because 
only McGowen, Sarah Jo, and Klein were there. The three were chatting 
idly until Vai showed up; she blushed as she realized she had 
interrupted them.

&quot;Whoops,&quot; she chuckled, &quot;did I stumble upon any secrets?&quot;

&quot;No, we&#39;re just chatting like three weirdoes,&quot; said Miss McGowen with a 
wave. She took Miss Johansson by the arm into her private room, possibly 
to resume the conversation, possibly to make out. That left Vai alone 
with Zane, who was currently smiling big.

&quot;Well?&quot; asked the older girl, &quot;Did you go through with it?&quot;

&quot;Yep,&quot; came the happy answer.

&quot;Good, good. Did she take it well?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Good, good.&quot; The two snickered. Zane beckoned Vai over, and the two sat 
together.

&quot;I gotta thank you for what you did. I know it sounds odd, but I was too 
much of a wimp to do anything about the whole Petra deal. I guess all I 
needed was a good friend to help me snap out of it. I&#39;m never going back 
to that psychotic bitch again, and I have you to thank for it.&quot;

&quot;I really didn&#39;t do that much,&quot; said Vai humbly. &quot;So what&#39;ll you do 
now?&quot;

&quot;Hmm, I&#39;ll keep my options open,&quot; said Zane, humming dreamily as she 
looked right into Vai&#39;s dark eyes. &quot;Right now I&#39;ll actually enjoy being 
able to breathe. I never knew how great it was being single until I had 
that awful barnacle stuck to my side. And who knows, maybe the beautiful 
princess of my dreams is closer than I think.&quot; Vai wasn&#39;t stupid enough 
to think that was a harmless comment, but she feigned indifference and 
wished Zane the best.

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have more luck than I will, Zane&#151;I mean, Rochelle.&quot; 
Klein blushed noticeably. Did Vai just whisper out her fantasy name??

&quot;Thanks...Veronica.&quot;
