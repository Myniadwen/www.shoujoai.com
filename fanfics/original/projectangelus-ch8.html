<h1>Project Angelus (part 8 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>      &quot;So... exactly what is going on now?&quot;

      Eveon was sitting on one of the beds in the hotel room, waiting for Miki to finish 
taking a shower. She was already clean, happy that the three sisters had brought her extra 
clothes. The siblings exchanged glances and non verbally decided that Hoshi should explain.

      &quot;Well,&quot; she started, &quot;Since you now have the Key to God, or the Seal of Light, we 
obviously can&#39;t just take you back home. We decided that we&#39;re going to have to just take 
down the Shadow Organization and the fiends.&quot;

      The blonde girl just stared at the three of them. &quot;Uh... can you... really do 
that...?&quot;

      Tsuki nodded. &quot;Yes, we just have to be really organized.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s why we split up,&quot; Hina chimed in.

      &quot;We all separated into groups based upon our strengths. The three of us were sent 
after you since we&#39;re the most versatile when it comes to attack, defense and strategy,&quot; 
Hoshi said. &quot;Then, everyone else went after what their strengths were.&quot;

      Hina grabbed a paper out of her backpack. &quot;Tsuru is really reluctant about tapping 
into her Demon Lord power, but because of it, she can see fiends without problem. Thus, 
she&#39;s going after them, along with Krystal since she has holy power. Of course, Isaka is 
going along as is Carmilla, since neither wants to leave their significant other alone.&quot;

      Tsuki peered over at the list. &quot;The Shadow Organization is a much more serious 
problem, so more people are going to be dealing with it... Bakra and Josh are going to 
rescue the woman Miki originally wanted to save, along with Tycara and Seth...&quot; The 
brunette let out a sigh. &quot;Tycara is a prime target though, so that&#39;s why they aren&#39;t going 
to be striking the organization head on. Seth is going along since he knows a lot of things 
and will be assisting with first aid along with research.&quot;

      Eveon scratched her head. &quot;But... wait. What about Erin and Faye? Or my mommy and 
Sakura... and Mina? Is she with you, or...?&quot;

      Hoshi shook her head. &quot;Mina is with Tsuru, Krystal, Isaka and Carmilla. Out of all of 
us, they&#39;re probably the best equipped to keep her safe. She would have come with us, but 
it&#39;s hard enough to protect just you so...&quot;

      The blonde nodded and Hina handed her the paper with the listing locations of 
everyone. Eveon frowned. &quot;...covert ops? Gate security...? Why does it say that next to 
Erin and Faye?&quot;

      Hoshi laughed. &quot;Oh, Erin is infiltrating the Shadow Organization by working there. 
She applied for a job and Faye is going to charm her way in... or something. They know the 
location of the Gate so after they get the information they need from the organization or 
their cover is blown, they&#39;re going to head over there to make sure it is secure.&quot;

      Eveon nodded dumbly. &quot;Why do I get feeling that the two of them being spies isn&#39;t a 
great idea? I mean, Faye is going to blow their cover by trying to screw Erin when she can! 
And is that even a power of being a goddess?&quot;

      Hina shrugged. &quot;Mmm, I dunno. Maybe they&#39;ll get lucky and get jobs in other places?&quot;

      Tsuki pointed to another entry on the piece of paper. &quot;Since the &#39;master&#39; of the 
fiend that visited your house wanted to see Sakura, she&#39;s planning to go find that man. 
Abby, of course, wanted to go with her... so that&#39;s what they&#39;re doing.&quot;

      &quot;So everyone&#39;s just separated to take down a monstrous organization?&quot;

      Hoshi nodded. &quot;Yes. It&#39;s the only way to keep you safe. Plus, we&#39;ll be destroying it 
from the inside out.&quot; 

***** 

      Eric was walking down the hallway, minding his own business... well, really thinking 
about how much he hated Lilith and Adrian, how Miki got a hold of the Demon Buster and the 
computer game he was about to beat, but that was beyond the point. He had just left the 
office to get a milkshake and now had to traverse through the lobby back to his office on 
the 46th floor.

      He wasn&#39;t looking forward to the long elevator ride (by the time he got to the top, 
he&#39;d probably finish the milkshake that was the reason for leaving in the first place), but 
he got a... horrid surprise.

      Just as he put his lips on the straw, he ran into someone and the plastic lid of the 
milkshake popped off. He was glad he always got vanilla since it splashed all over his 
white lab coat and the white t-shirt beneath. Awesome, now he would have to go back to the 
fast food restaurant to order another.

      Eric figured his bad luck was over until he heard the screeching click of sliding 
heels and his mysterious milkshake destroyer fell on top of him. At this point, the young 
professor was ready to demand a new milkshake and an explanation.

      That is... until his eyes first made contact with a partially unbuttoned blouse and 
delicious cleavage right in front of his eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; came a female voice. Eric no 
longer cared about the cold, sticky milkshake on his clothes.

      A hot girl just fell on top of him. She started to get up, digging frantically in her 
purse before taking out some tissues. &quot;I-I wasn&#39;t watching where I was going and these 
heels are new so I just tripped and, uh...&quot;

      She started to wipe at the milkshake, still partially straddling him. Eric sat up. 
&quot;Oh, no problem at all miss. You can fall on top of me any day!&quot; He didn&#39;t mean to say that 
last part and the girl immediately got off of him.

      An awkward silence ensued as he rose to his feet with his empty milkshake cup in his 
hands. Eric smiled broadly at the blushing girl. She looked like a college student, wearing 
a jacket, blouse and skirt. And very high heels - the supposed reason for her trip. She 
brushed some of her chocolate brown hair out of her eyes, handing Eric some more tissue to 
wipe his shirt and coat.

      His eyes immediately spied the visitor badge clipped to her jacket. &quot;Out of 
curiosity, what are you here at the Shadow Organization for?&quot;

      &quot;Oh... I... I&#39;m trying to get a job to help pay for college. Since this is such a 
huge pharmaceutical company, I figured there might be some opening if I asked,&quot; She bit her 
lip. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry about your drink.&quot;

      &quot;Oh, it&#39;s fine,&quot; he said, throwing the cup away. &quot;What kind of job are you looking 
for?&quot;

      &quot;Like a secretary,&quot; she said, fidgeting awkwardly. &quot;But they have no need for any new 
ones, so I was planning on going-&quot;

      &quot;Secretary?&quot; Eric&#39;s mind started to work away. The girl in front of him was hot with 
her hair up in a hairclip like some kind of office worker fantasy and she needed a job? As 
a secretary? &quot;I&#39;m in need of a secretary!&quot;

      The girl jumped at his sudden proclamation. &quot;R...really...?&quot;

      &quot;Yes! I mean, my desk is a mess, I need someone to get milkshakes for me and I need 
the company!&quot; He grabbed her hands. &quot;I could totally land you a high paying job - just name 
your hours, your price!&quot;

      She seemed slightly frightened. &quot;Are you sure...? I could just try a different part 
of the company-&quot;

      &quot;You&#39;re hired,&quot; he said, dragging her towards the elevator. He took out his ID and 
let the machine scan it. &quot;I&#39;m so excited! Why didn&#39;t I think about getting an assistant or 
a secretary sooner?&quot;

      &quot;Uh, wait! What about an interview or checking my references?&quot; He just pulled girl in 
with him as the elevator started towards the 46th floor.

      &quot;No worries - you&#39;re qualified...&quot; He stopped and looked over at the girl. &quot;What&#39;s 
your name?&quot;

      She gave him a small smile. &quot;I&#39;m Erin. Erin Schlange.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;...so all your lesbian friends are going off to destroy the Shadow Organization?&quot;

      &quot;Hey! There are two gay guys and a straight couple... plus, my mommy and Faye are 
technically bisexual!&quot;

      Miki let out a long sigh before looking back down at the list. &quot;Is it even possible 
to know this many lesbians...? Really...?&quot;

      Eveon pouted and looked away. &quot;You know what, I didn&#39;t exactly ask for all of them to 
be my friends and decided to use our house as a headquarters.&quot;

      The green eyed girl laughed as she brushed her hair, but suddenly stopped. &quot;Wait... 
but those three girls that just went into the shower together...?&quot;

      &quot;Huh? Oh, Hina, Tsuki and Hoshi? Their sisters,&quot; Eveon said slowly, trying to brace 
herself for the eventual awkward question.

      &quot;...as in related by blood...?&quot;

      &quot;So far as I know, yeah. Their faces look alike, even if their hair is different...&quot;

      &quot;And they went into the shower together?&quot;

      Eveon just gave her a crooked grin. &quot;You had a sister right? Didn&#39;t you two ever do 
that?&quot;

      Miki nodded, as though trying to convince herself that nothing was happening in the 
hotel shower. &quot;Y... yeah... kind of. When we were younger and she was always sick, so I 
helped her... but... those three...&quot;

      She covered her mouth. &quot;That&#39;s disgusting! They aren&#39;t really-&quot;

      &quot;Hey! You don&#39;t have to be rude about it,&quot; Eveon responded, cutting her off. &quot;They&#39;re 
happy together and it&#39;s not our place to judge. It&#39;s their own business.&quot;

      &quot;Easy for you to say, being an only child. Just the thought of that is...&quot; Miki made 
a face. &quot;They aren&#39;t seriously doing stuff, are they?&quot;

      The blonde let out a long sigh. &quot;Please, just don&#39;t mention anything about it to 
them. They went through a lot of heartache because of it and they are really nice, even if 
Hoshi seems dead set on adding girls to her harem.&quot;

      Miki seemed a little startled by that. &quot;R-really? But... ugh... I just need to stop 
thinking about it. People in love. Three people. Three girls... three... sisters...&quot; She 
flopped on the bed. &quot;Gah... Eveon! Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s weird?&quot;

      Eveon shook her head. &quot;Just wait until you meet some of my other friends. They&#39;re 
just as... interesting...&quot;

      Her companion just wrapped her arms around herself. &quot;At this rate... I&#39;m probably 
going to get lesbian cooties...&quot;

      &quot;I can help with that.&quot;

      Miki jumped at the voice and noticed it was Hoshi just coming out of the bathroom, 
dripping wet and with only a towel wrapped around her body. The 16 year old immediately hid 
herself behind Eveon. &quot;I feel like my straightness is under attack!&quot;

      Eveon just scoffed at her actions as Hoshi laughed. &quot;You do know I&#39;m just as gay as 
Hoshi right?&quot; 

***** 

      Lilith stared down at the pill in a bit of disgust. Only Eric would stoop so low as 
to put the serum within the birth control he made for her. He was such a crude man... but 
at the same time she could hear his voice calling her a whore, a slut...

      A murderer.

      She shook the thoughts from her head and popped it in her mouth. She chased it with a 
drink of water, placing the small cup in the sink when she was finished. She hated the 
medicine - she just wanted to let the power take over her body so she wouldn&#39;t have to 
think anymore.

      What could be the worse that could happen? Her going insane? It wasn&#39;t likely - she 
would never betray Adrian and that was why...

      &quot;Are you coming to bed?&quot; He was standing in the doorway to the bedroom, which was 
completely visibly from the kitchen. She looked over at the handsome man, his dress shirt 
unbuttoned and the belt on his slacks hanging loose. Her eyes drifted over to the open 
living room as a throbbing filled her head.

      The windows showed the city outside, with all its lights shining brightly. Too 
brightly. They made her headache worse. Adrian came over to her as she faced the sink, her 
hands braced against the counter.

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; he whispered into her ear.

      &quot;I... I&#39;m not in the mood... it&#39;s the medicine,&quot; she murmured as he pressed against 
her.

      It was quiet until Adrian swiftly changed the subject. &quot;Eveon has the Key to God now, 
doesn&#39;t she?&quot;

      Lilith nodded as he continued on. &quot;No matter - I was planning for her to be captured 
anyway. The fiends are interested in her, so I thought she&#39;d make a nice peace offering...&quot; 
He trailed off, thinking about it to himself. &quot;But now we need her to open the Gate, so I&#39;m 
not sure how it will work out.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Lilith whispered, rubbing her forehead in frustration. &quot;If I had broken 
Dark faster and gotten the Seal of Light, then we could have gotten the power of the 
Creator already.&quot;

      Adrian just smiled. &quot;Actually, it&#39;s kind of nicer this way. Capturing Eveon gives me 
something to give to the fiends and something to use against Sakura... also, in case there 
is a trap at the Gate, Eveon will be our little shield since she&#39;s the Key. It all works 
out nicely.&quot;

      &quot;What about Miki?&quot;

      He swept back some of his platinum blonde hair. &quot;Just kill her again - she&#39;s useless. 
Whatever abilities she may have had before...&quot; He placed a hand on the tattoo on Lilith&#39;s 
navel. &quot;You have it all now.&quot;

      She forced a smile on her face. &quot;Eric said that I have to keep taking this medicine 
because it was meant for Alice to have.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s true - our silly prototype core maker wanted to give it to Alice. Eric&#39;s 
worried that the core will backlash against you since it has a mind of its own,&quot; he 
murmured.

      Lilith swallowed uncomfortably, secretly glad to have Eric watching over her body. He 
was an ass, but he was a smart, efficient ass.

      Adrian started to laugh. &quot;But there&#39;s nothing to worry about. I had to eliminate 
Alice because it was only natural for her to turn against me if she found out the truth. 
Miki... once she&#39;s dead we should be fine.&quot;

      &quot;...by the way,&quot; Lilith started, &quot;Who is this Sakura you want so badly?&quot;

      Adrian didn&#39;t miss the jealous implications in her voice. Lilith wasn&#39;t in a good 
mood tonight - that was part of the reason he hated Eric&#39;s medicine... it made her too 
aware of the things going on around her. At the same time, if Lilith didn&#39;t take it and 
wrecked her insides, that just wouldn&#39;t be good at all.

      &quot;Oh, please... she&#39;s just an old acquaintance. I doubt she remembers me,&quot; he said 
with a laugh. &quot;Plus, as the former Living Inferno she poses a threat to our plans. I 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Purgatory gets involved soon and she will be the first person they 
go to.&quot;

      Lilith was about to speak when a sudden burst of music interrupted her. Adrian looked 
back over at the bedroom before leaving. He grabbed his cell phone, noticing that the 
caller ID was Eric. &quot;Hello?&quot;

      &quot;Hey, since you don&#39;t need the angel anymore, what do you want to do with her?&quot; Eric 
never liked to mince words over the phone...

      &quot;Knowing you, you&#39;ve already got a plan in mind,&quot; Adrian said, sitting down on the 
bed. He could see Lilith coming in with a glass of water, still looking annoyed by the 
medicine. &quot;And Lilith isn&#39;t too fond of her new birth control.&quot;

      &quot;Oh, what do you care Adrian? As long as you can screw her, nothing else should 
matter. Anyway, yeah I already have a plan for the angel. I was planning to see to all her 
wounds from your stupid whore and then I was going to ask where to put her,&quot; Eric said, 
currently lounging in his office chair.

      &quot;She&#39;s going to be returned to her home near Heaven&#39;s Gate, of course,&quot; Adrian 
murmured as he watched Lilith undress to get ready to take a shower. &quot;I can&#39;t go killing 
the Guardian of Light and expect the angels to not be infuriated. I&#39;ve already been pushing 
my luck by having her kidnapped for these last six weeks.&quot;

      &quot;Right-o. I will deal with her recovery and then you can inform me of how we&#39;ll be 
sending her back,&quot; Eric said before pausing. &quot;You&#39;re a sick bastard, you know that? You&#39;d 
probably kill her if you had the chance.&quot;

      &quot;Good night, Eric,&quot; he said simply before flipping his phone shut. He could hear the 
sounds of running water from the bathroom as he lied down on the bed.
