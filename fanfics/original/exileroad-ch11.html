<a href="../original/exileroad-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The home was quiet as the three women returned from
the castle, the streets busy and packed with people.
Both Midori and Laur&#39;ien were spaced out around Jantha
as they walked, warding her simply but effectively
from the crowd.

Elise bowed as she opened the door, the little redhead
wearing a black dress. &quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; she smiled, her
glance flickering to Midori and Laur&#39;ien, &quot;welcome
home.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jantha smiled at her servant, then
reluctantly gave way as Midori carefully looked around
the whole entrance way. &quot;We haven&#39;t been invaded, I
think,&quot; the lovely blonde scolded her bodyguard.

&quot;Better to be safe,&quot; Midori answered mildly, short
black hair falling into her eyes as she gestured for
the others to enter first.

&quot;Good to see you again,&quot; Laur&#39;ien murmured to Elisa,
only getting a frown from the pretty young lady.
&#39;Obviously she hasn&#39;t forgiven me just yet,&#39; she
mused.

&quot;Cook has started your dinner as usual,&quot; Elisa tried
to follow at a respectful distance until a smiling
Jantha ordered her to walk beside her, &quot;an&#39; the bath
water is being heated for later.&quot;

&quot;Y&#39;know, I could get used to this,&quot; Laur&#39;ien whispered
to Midori, the two following behind as the lady and
her maid talked.

&quot;Not me,&quot; Midori shook her head, &quot;I prefer my rooms at
the inn, honestly.&quot;

&quot;You seem to like to appear a savage,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said
with a smile, &quot;but from what I&#39;ve heard of the eastern
lands they&#39;re very civilized.&quot;

Midori raised a eyebrow as she continued mildly, &quot;Why
do you think I left?&quot;

Laur&#39;ien chuckled softly at that comment. &quot;One day,&quot;
she warned only half jokingly, &quot;I will know your
secrets.&quot;

Jantha found herself nodding thoughtfully as she
deliberately overheard them talking together. &#39;Midori
certainly seems to like to keep her secrets,&#39; she
mused. When they reached her bedroom door Midori
silently opened the door, quickly scanning the
interior for anything out of place.

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Elisa tentatively added before Jantha could
go inside, &quot;the Countess Hazan and her... companion,
Ra&#39;hel were here earlier, asking to see you. I
understand they intend to visit you again tomorrow.&quot;

Jantha visibly stiffened up, then she relaxed. &quot;Thank
you, Elisa,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I&#39;ll be ready to see
them tomorrow.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien and Midori exchanged curious looks at her
reaction, then they cautiously followed her into the
bedroom. Behind a wooden screen Jantha quickly went to
work stripping off her formal gown, exchanging it for
a casual dress even as Midori mildly asked, &quot;Is this
Countess someone we need to worry about?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Jantha said flatly.

Raising an eyebrow Midori looked at Laur&#39;ien, who had
a wry smile on her pretty face. &quot;From what I&#39;ve heard
the Countess Hazan is the leader of the Guild of
Gentlewomen,&quot; she whispered to Midori softly in
explanation.

Midori frowned, &quot;There is no such guild.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Laur&#39;ien agreed, &quot;but they&#39;re trying to
organize such a thing, with broad support across every
class of women in the city.&quot;

&quot;An&#39; how come I&#39;ve ne&#39;er heard of them?&quot; Midori
frowned.

&quot;They&#39;re quite foolish in some ways?&quot; Jantha offered
in explanation as she stepped out from behind the
screen in a much simpler sort of dress. Her eyes
twinkled with amusement as she pointed out, &quot;Why, I
would have thought that at least some of the members
would have heard the Ballad of the Magnificent
Midori.&quot;

Midori groaned as Laur&#39;ien chuckled softly.

A bit more seriously Jantha continued, &quot;And to be
honest, I think they&#39;d be nervous in approaching the
city&#39;s hire-swords.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien tried not to laugh as she recalled, &quot;The ones
who came to us in the barracks looked like they were
going to faint.&quot;

&#39;An&#39; it seems pretty clear that the Duchess doesn&#39;t
like them,&#39; Midori thought as they left all the
bedroom, &#39;but why?&#39;

The afternoon shifted to evening, a few friends of
Jantha paying calls, then she headed to bed even as
Midori and Laur&#39;ien took turns at standing watch
through the night. The next day was a little quieter,
Jantha only paying a few calls to the embassies of
several local kingdoms. Few of them seemed bothered by
the presence of the two bodyguards, diplomats and
nobles of that level were used to dealing with such
things.

&quot;Did that go as badly as I thought it did?&quot; Laur&#39;ien
asked as they went along the Street of Gold, the main
avenue through the high class part of the city.

Jantha&#39;s lips were pressed into a flat line. &quot;Yes,&quot;
she quietly conceded, &quot;especially the last one. It
seems that his lord and master is nearly drooling over
the idea of having a ruler they regard as weak on the
throne.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be in for a rude awakening,&quot; Midori
commented, thinking of her meeting with Queen Gwen. If
this woman was anything, it wasn&#39;t weak.

There was a soft snort of laughter from Jantha, &quot;True
enough.&quot;

A soft sound from Laur&#39;ien caught their attention as
they neared Jantha&#39;s home, &quot;Looks like some guests
have arrived.&quot;

The fine home was an older building, the stone and
brick made by the best artisans of that era, designed
to stand boldly apart from the common people.
Balconies swung out of the upper floors, towers on the
top floor providing a view of the city around them.
Standing inn front of the fine building were two
women, each as different as night and day.

The tall, black haired woman wore men&#39;s trousers, a
long overcoat and white undershirt, giving her an
oddly masculine air despite her grace. Her face
couldn&#39;t be described as beautiful, there was far too
much strength for that, but handsome might fit. Beside
her a young blonde haired woman rested her legs as she
sat on her step, being careful to not wrinkle her
flowing dress, her elfin face filled with a gentle
adoration as she talked to her companion.

Midori reflexedly moved Jantha behind her when the
noblewoman put a warning hand up. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot;
Jantha said, &quot;they&#39;re... friends, of a sort.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m hurt,&quot; the tall woman tried to joke, but
something in her eyes said those words were truthful.
She studied Midori a moment then bowed, &quot;I am the
Countess Hazan.&quot; Her eyes tended to Laur&#39;ien and she
smiled slightly, &quot;We&#39;ve met, I recall?&quot;

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Laur&#39;ien nodded with a smile.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Jantha said, frowning at the two
of them. She stood there with her arms crossed, a
frown on her face, and almost everything in her
posture indicating that she wasn&#39;t at all pleased to
see them.

&quot;Not to talk about this on the street, I hope,&quot; the
lovely blonde murmured.

&quot;Ra&#39;hel may have a point,&quot; Hazan said, her gaze
silently appealing to Jantha.

Jantha pressed her lips together in annoyance but
nodded curtly. &quot;Come in,&quot; she said, letting Midori go
first to open the door, the rest of them following
inside.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Laur&#39;ien stopped Ra&#39;hel at the door, &quot;I
need you to surrender your knives before you can come
inside.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have...&quot; Ra&#39;hel trailed off when she saw the
look in Laur&#39;ien&#39;s eyes.

With surprising firmness Laur&#39;ien coldly said, &quot;I will
not allow anyone carrying concealed arms to meet with
m&#39;lady.&quot; A pause before she quietly added, &quot;No matter
where my personal sympathies may lay.&quot;

With reluctance Ra&#39;hel drew a knife from between her
breasts, another concealed within her sleeve and
handed them over, &quot;Now may I enter?&quot;

&quot;As soon as you give me the blade strapped to your
thigh.&quot;

Ra&#39;hel blinked then laughed musically as she conceded,
&quot;You are good.&quot; Drawing up her long dress she revealed
the sheath strapped to her thigh and pulled free a
wicked looking blade.

&#39;An interesting pair,&#39; Midori thought as they walked
into the house, &#39;I wonder what they want with Jantha?
Or what they did to annoy her so much?&#39;

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Elisa bowed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry for not letting in
your guests, but from what you said...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be more annoyed if you had,&quot; Jantha cut her off.
&quot;Is the drawing room ready?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Elisa nodded, &quot;should I bring drinks?&quot;

Jantha looked at her two guests and sighed, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll
probably need it.&quot;</pre>
