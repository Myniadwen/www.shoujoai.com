<h1>Threads of Fate (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/akayuri.html">AkaYuri</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/threadfate-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>-In gym class-

The boys and girls are split up in half as each are put into a group to 
perform different sports.

&quot;Today feels so slow~!&quot; Asuka said stretching &quot;I can&#39;t wait till lunch.&quot;

Mion laughs. &quot;You&#39;ll live,&quot; she said with a smile as she holds a 
volleyball in hand, &quot;Ready?&quot;

The other side of the court cheers a &quot;Yeah!&quot; and Mion serves it. Soon 
after the 1st game, the girls relax on the bench or take a water break 
while others indulge in gossip while watching others play.

&quot;My god-she&#39;s fast!&quot;

Mion and Asuka walks outside to the courtyard where other students in 
gym were watching a tennis court match in awe. Standing at the fenced 
gate behind other students, they notice the two gym students playing 
were Sayuri and Keisuke.

&quot;Sayuri?&quot; Mion said to no one in particular but herself

Rushing quickly to her left, Sayuri smacks the ball back to Keisuke as 
he begins to wind back his arm. Quickly, Keisuke allows the ball to 
bounce once on his side and quickly shot the ball back over the net. 
Sayuri springs forward quickly and in full force slam the ball back. The 
tennis ball ricochets back to Kei and hits onto the gravel, an inch from 
Kei&#39;s foot landing Sayuri a point. The small crowd cheers sending 
compliments across to both players.

Mion smiles as she watches her friend, knowing full well her hours of 
practicing kendo at home had help her easily maneuver during the tennis 
match. Since the match was not still over, the two students continue to 
play their match as Mion, Asuka and the others watch in anticipation.

&quot;She&#39;s amazing, don&#39;t you think?&quot; Asuka asks Mion as they both face each 
other. &quot;Seeing her play with complete focus makes her give off some cool 
aura.&quot; She laughs.

Mion nods and turns back to the tennis court., watching Sayuri. Her 
heart begins to pound in her chest as her eyes drink the alluring, at 
least in her opinion, features of her friend.

Sayuri&#39;s sleek black hair was tied in a tight ponytail, most likely to 
stop itself from being a distraction, Mion figured. Swaying gracefully 
in the air, Mion stood there, memorized for a few seconds until she 
changed her attention to the face.

Mentally, Mion zooms to look at Sayuri&#39;s blood colored like eyes and 
smiles to herself. Some students were terrified of her friend&#39;s eyes 
since her cold demeanor plus the red eyes, caused an ominous atmosphere 
that caused everyone to never want to stand more than 4 feet close to 
her unless needed to, like handing out assignments. To Mion however, she 
felt safe whenever she looked into them. To her, she found that Sayuri 
had never looked at her once with any hint of anger or anything 
threatening, with the exception of meeting her for the first time years 
ago. Now she always had a gentle gaze as if she felt that anything more 
intense would cause Mion to shatter as fragile as glass. She can&#39;t help 
but feel special... and fall in love with those eyes, and the owner.

As her eyes begin to follow down the face, Mion quickly notices her 
actions and shake her head, blushing.  Asuka turns to Mion wondering 
what was going on her friend&#39;s head. An imaginary light bulb flashes in 
her mind. Slowly, Asuka slides herself behind Mion and lightly puts her 
hands on her shoulder. Then to her best ability, Asuka lowers the tone 
of her voice and whispers in Mion&#39;s ear, &quot;Are you getting hot watching 
&#39;em?&quot; Mion yelps out in surprise, and weeps as she notices her friend 
Asuka laughing at her.

&quot;Why&#39;d you have to do that for Asuka?&quot; she pouts

Asuka wipes a tear out of her eye. &quot;More importantly, why were u 
blushing?&quot; she said &quot;And which one of them were you staring at anyway?&quot;

&quot;I-I,&quot; she stutters

&quot;Sayuri-senpai! Keisuke-senpai! &quot;

Mion and Asuka turn back to the court to notice some of the students 
rushing towards the two players. Keisuke smiles as a fan walk up to him, 
and hands him an obento happily; others circling around him giving him 
compliments. Meanwhile, Sayuri looks in shock as a shy girl hands out a 
white cotton towel towards her.

&quot;You were great Senpai, I hope to play tennis as great as you. Here, a 
towel,&quot;

Sayuri stares at her with a confused yet embarrassed expression on her 
face. &quot;I... wasn&#39;t that great. I&#39;m not even a tennis player-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I know,&quot; the girl said cutting her off  &quot;You&#39;re on the kendo 
and karate club right?&quot;

&quot;Uh, yes, I am,&quot; Sayuri said, surprised that the girl knew. &quot;H-how&#39;d you 
know?&quot;

The girl giggles. &quot;You&#39;re really funny Senpai. Don&#39;t you know you have a 
few admirers? Here,&quot; she said again with her towel in hand and motioning 
it to her. &quot;It&#39;s to wipe off your sweat.&quot;

Sayuri stares at her for a second as sweat drops down her neck, 
wondering to herself if she should take it.

&quot;Um, it&#39;s okay really-&quot; Sayuri stops as the girl leans forward and 
reaches forward to her face with her two hands holding the towel to 
wipes off her face. Quickly, Sayuri&#39;s hand shot up from her side and 
holds both of the girl&#39;s hands. &quot;I-it&#39;s okay. I got it,&quot; she said 
nervously and forces a smile as her eyes closed in an arch. The girl 
smiles happily in return, and hands her the towel.

Asuka grins and stops as she turns over to Mion, and notice her friend 
clutching her chest as if she was in pain. Trying not to laugh, Asuka 
smiles, turning to the court while saying out loud for her friend to 
hear, &quot;She must not like it very much.&quot;

Mion turns to her friend as she snaps out of her thoughts, &quot;What?&quot;

Asuka smirks. &quot;I said... she must not like it very much,&quot; she replied

&quot;Not like what?&quot; Mion asks

&quot;Being touched,&quot; Asuka uses her thumb to point over at Sayuri, &quot;She 
never smiles like that. With her eyes closed. It must mean she doesn&#39;t 
wanna show something with her eyes...I dunno, anger maybe... So she 
closes them and pretends to look like she&#39;s smiling. And by the way she 
quickly stop the girl from touching her face. Her reaction was 
incredibly fast, like a reflex even.&quot;

&quot;Eh, souka (really)?&quot; Asuka said and looks over at Sayuri, &quot;that&#39;s true 
isn&#39;t it...&quot;

Sayuri opens her eyes and notices her friends standing over at the 
fence. Bowing, she excuses herself from the girl and walks over to Asuka 
and Mion.

&quot;You guys were watching?&quot; Sayuri asks with a slight smile as she wipes 
herself off with the towel.

Asuka nods. &quot;Of course we were, who else?&quot; she said with a grin &quot; You 
were amazing, everyone practically gawked at you with their chin on the 
floor seeing how fast you were. Even the girls were staring.&quot;

Sayuri blushes, a bit uneasy. &quot;I see,&quot; she said &quot;I thought you guys 
would rather watch the guys play volleyball, or soccer, or them playing 
basketball.&quot;

Mion smiles. &quot;Well unfortunately for them, you were creating a bigger 
ruckus. Apparently with the crowd u had. And plus the screaming fans.&quot;

&quot;Ah... well..,&quot; Sayuri said smiling slightly, &quot;Doesn&#39;t really matter. 
Just knowing u guys were watching me is a crowd big enough for me.&quot;

Then in a couple of seconds, the bell rings for lunch and the class 
disperse into the locker rooms showering and changing into their 
clothes. Afterwards students scatter everywhere around school as some 
rush to the cafeteria to buy a certain food before the supply is empty. 
While others eat their lunch in the classroom or outside. For Asuka, she 
sits under a large sakura tree with Sayuri, relief filling her body as 
she was glad they had shade on such a hot day.

Sayuri leans her back on the tree as she wait&#39;s for Mion&#39;s arrival with 
her arms crossed in front of her chest. &quot;Why isn&#39;t she here yet?&quot; she 
asks, clueless to the situation Mion was in.

Asuka smiles smugly and waves her forefinger side to side at Sayuri. 
&quot;She&#39;ll be here, she just has to go to the rooftop of the school-&quot;

&quot;Wait what?&quot; Sayuri said springing herself upright, &quot;At the rooftop of 
the school?&quot;

Asuka nods, and said  &quot;A guy is probably confessing his love for her. 
You do know she has admirers too, don&#39;t you?&quot; saying the last part as if 
it obvious.

Sayuri frowns. &quot;Of course I know. For a second there, I got worried she 
was going to do something...&quot; she said with a sigh, &quot;Well if its just 
that, then good for her.&quot;

&quot;Aw... not jealous are we?&quot; Asuka asks

Sayuri shakes her head. &quot;No, she deserves to find someone after all. 
Just because I hang out with her all the time doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ll die if 
she has a boyfriend. Since she did spend all her time with me, she 
should find someone she enjoys company with.&quot; She leans her back to the 
tree and closes her eyes. &quot;I just kinda hope that she hurries back.&quot;

&quot;Eh? Why?&quot;

&quot;Because I need food,&quot; Sayuri mutters

&quot;Oh.. That&#39;s all?&quot;

Sayuri slightly nods with her eyes still shut. &quot;And hope that the guy 
won&#39;t do anything rash or I&#39;ll pound his face in.&quot;

Asuka looks at her friend in disbelief and bursts out into laughter. &quot;I 
see, well let&#39;s hope he doesn&#39;t,&quot; she said knowing full well Mion was 
going to turn down .

Sayuri on the other hand, drifts off into her thoughts until she hears a 
shuffling noise of grass behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, did you wait long?&quot;

&quot;No no, not that long,&quot; Asuka said waving her hand side to side &quot;So... 
how&#39;d it go?&quot;

Mion smiles. &quot;Fine, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Really...&quot; Asuka said with a leer, &quot;I&#39;m guessing you turned the poor 
guy down huh?&quot;

Mion nods while placing an obento in front of herself and Sayuri. 
&quot;Pretty much,&quot; she answers.

Asuka stares at Mion for a second and decides to leave the conversation 
as it is and changes topics as Sayuri and Mion begin to eat....

- Later at Mion&#39;s residence -

Mion crosses her arms and lays it on the edge in the bath tub while 
resting her head on it. She closes her eyes as she recalls the 
conversation that had taken place at the rooftop earlier that day.

-Flashback-

Mion had just open the door to the top of the building and places her 
hand over her eyes as the light flood through the doorway. Taking a few 
steps forward, she gazes around to notice the rooftop abandoned and a 
male student standing in front of her with a nervous smile on his face. 
She recognizes him.

&quot;Kinomoto Keisuke I presume?&quot; she said with a polite smile

He smiles and nods. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m surprised you know my name-well you did 
watch the game today so...&quot; He laughs nervously and then coughs into his 
hand &quot;Um... Mion-san, I know you might not know me very well but.. 
well.. I&#39;m a very nice guy. Athletic and I&#39;ll treat you with the utmost 
respect and ..well...&quot; He pauses and takes inhales. &quot;Would you like to 
be my girlfriend?!&quot; he shouts in one breath.

Mion smiles as a breeze swept across the rooftop, creating a silent 
moment for a the two. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; she said, &quot;I know.. You must be a 
great guy but.. I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t,&quot;

&quot;I.. I see..&quot; he said staring down at the ground. A lump forms in his 
throat and he balled up his hands &quot;Can.. Can you tell me why? If there&#39;s 
a reason that is..&quot;

Mion frowns for a second and  glances at the floor, than back up to 
Keisuke. &quot;Because... I&#39;m already in love with someone...&quot;

-End of Flashback-

Mion opens her eyes as she notices herself still laying in the tub of 
water. Thinking she has enough time in the bathroom, she gets out. A few 
minutes later, fully clothed , Mion walks out to the living room to see 
the sliding doors was open and Sayuri laying on her back with her arms 
places crossed behind her head acting like a cushion on the wooden 
walkway.

Sayuri&#39;s eyes twitch as she notices footsteps coming closer and lays 
herself upright. Opening her eyes she notices her friend sitting behind 
her at the edge of the walkway with her legs sprawled out in the air to 
stretch. Sayuri turns herself to a 90% angle allowing her to sit right 
next to Mion and stares off at the small pond reflecting the moon in 
water in front of them. Knowing her friend was preoccupied with 
thoughts, Sayuri stays quiet and doesn&#39;t move as her friend lays her 
head on Sayuri&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Love.. Must be a very heart wrenching feeling...&quot; Mion murmurs as she 
closes her eyes.

Sayuri continues to stare at the pond, silent for a few seconds as her 
mind flashes a memory of a woman being beaten by her husband. &quot;It 
is...it most certainly is...&quot; she replies quietly as she shut her eyes 
tightly.</pre>
