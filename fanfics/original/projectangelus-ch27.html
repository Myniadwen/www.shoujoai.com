<h1>Project Angelus (part 27 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>      Alice trekked up the metal stairs, nervous. Mariah patted her on the back as they 
made it to the second floor. &quot;It will be fine. I&#39;m right here,&quot; the older girl murmured. 
Alice nodded and opened the rusted, industrial looking double doors.

      A solitary light shone from the high ceiling, illuminating the young girl sitting on 
the table near the back of the room. Miki had been waiting for her and turned to look at 
Alice with her earthy, cinnamon eyes gleaming against the dim lighting.

      Alice drew her sword as her sister got off of the table and Mariah opened her book as 
they both stepped into the middle of the room. &quot;Miki...&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Please! I know 
you&#39;re possessed by a demon, but we don&#39;t have to fight!&quot;

      Miki said nothing and charged, red energy blazing around her. &quot;Watch out Alice!&quot; 
Mariah cried out, stepping in front of the shocked girl and conjuring up a spell to stop 
Miki.

      She was blasted away by Miki&#39;s power, her spells no match. Mariah skidded across the 
room before landing a bit outside the doorway. Alice turned to help her, but red energy 
crackled around the doors before they shut close, locking.

      Alice gritted her teeth, stepping back from Miki. &quot;Now it&#39;s just us,&quot; the black 
haired girl stated, much to Alice&#39;s dismay. She had to fight Miki by herself?

      She readied her sword as Miki charged at her, still using the same powers she 
displayed earlier. Alice barely parried the blow, trying to keep herself safe as Miki 
attacked recklessly. &quot;Please!&quot; Alice repeated. &quot;I don&#39;t want to fight!&quot;

      Without warning, Miki lunged at her shoulder, causing a gash. Alice winced and struck 
out at Miki without thinking. She slashed her sister across the chest and Miki fell over, 
smiling happily. Alice stared at her sister now lying helplessly on the ground and at her 
own bloody sword. 

***** 

      &quot;Oh come on,&quot; Mariah whispered to herself as she tried to open the doors. How could 
she have been so careless? She took out the knife Eric had given her and attempted to jam 
it into the lock to force it open.

      She turned around as she heard clunking footsteps up the stairs and was relieved to 
recognize the Shadow Organization soldiers. &quot;Thank goodness,&quot; she said. &quot;Alice is trapped 
in there fighting Miki...!&quot;

      She was going to ask them to help her open the door when she noticed their cocked 
guns and grim expressions behind the visors of their helmets. Mariah swallowed 
uncomfortably as a man with blonde hair and icy blue eyes came up the stairs.

      &quot;I believe,&quot; Adrian said, barely looking at Mariah. &quot;It&#39;s time to start the plan.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Come here, Alice,&quot; Miki groaned, motioning to her sister. Just as the dirty blonde 
haired girl was about to go to her bleeding sister&#39;s side, she heard gunshots from behind 
the closed doors. Holes started to riddle the metal doors as the shots continued, confusing 
her.

      Suddenly, the doors were kicked open and a group of soldiers came in with their guns 
ready. &quot;Step away from her, Alice!&quot; Adrian called out as walked over to his adopted sister. 
&quot;She&#39;s trying to trick you.&quot;

      Alice backed away from Miki, gaping at him. &quot;You... you&#39;re alive, big brother?&quot;

      He nodded. &quot;Yes. Miki tried to kill me in the fire, but she failed.&quot;

      The soldiers had secured the elevator in the back of the room and were busy doing 
something on the wall. &quot;Alice!&quot; Miki cried out, her voice frightened and scared. &quot;Wait!&quot;

      Alice turned to her sister, wondering why she was calling out to her, when a sudden 
loud sound reached her ears and a burning pain seared through her chest. She... she 
couldn&#39;t breathe very well. Alice slipped to her knees as she noticed her shirt was soaking 
up blood. She looked up to see Adrian standing in front of her with a pistol, a 
disappointed look on his face.

      &quot;I must have missed you heart,&quot; he said simply as Alice fell over on her side and 
ultimately rolled onto her back. She was desperately trying to breathe even though the 
bullet pierced her lung. &quot;Lilith!&quot; He called out behind him.

      Alice could barely make out the form of Lilith, but the young woman walked 
confidently along the floor, brandishing the knife Mariah originally had. &quot;Right,&quot; she said 
before leaning over Miki. The black haired girl gave out a sharp cry as she was stabbed 
through the gut and Alice started to cry. How could this have happened...? What was going 
on?!

      Lilith dug around Miki&#39;s insides for a bit before extracting the bright red core from 
her body. Adrian nodded to her and she hesitantly pulled up her shirt before pushing the 
core against her exposed navel. Lilith hissed as the core became absorbed into her own 
body. Alice watched with cloudy eyes as Lilith&#39;s hair became a light shade of purple and 
her eyes took on the same color.

      Adrian smiled. &quot;Good. It worked.&quot; He headed towards the elevator as the soldiers 
finished setting C4 charges on the walls.

      Lilith began to follow him until Alice grabbed at her ankle, blood starting to fill 
her lung. &quot;Wait,&quot; she coughed out. &quot;...Mariah...?&quot;

      Lilith just looked down before kicking her hand away. &quot;Mariah? What a hateful name... 
Do you miss her?&quot;

      The older woman dropped Mariah&#39;s spell book and rosary next to Alice. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about her. She&#39;s just as dead as you are about to be.&quot;

      Alice could only watch as the soldiers exited the room through the doors and headed 
down the staircase while Adrian and Lilith entered the elevator. As they were going down, 
Alice caught a glimpse of them kissing.

      How could this have happened? How could Adrian shoot her...? And Mariah was...? She 
began to cry harder as her breathing became more painful and labored. Miki was gone too... 
Alice could barely make out the charges on the wall, hoping she would be dead before they 
went off.

      This wasn&#39;t what was supposed to happen... what about her dinner with Mariah and 
their plans to see the world?

      &quot;...A... Alice...&quot; Miki was crawling towards her, clutching her stomach in pain.

      Alice couldn&#39;t say anything anymore because it hurt too much and she was coughing up 
blood. Miki finally fell over on her, her head resting on Alice&#39;s stomach. &quot;I&#39;m so... so 
sorry,&quot; the black haired girl whispered. &quot;That core... I wanted you to kill me so you have 
it.&quot;

      Alice didn&#39;t answer but slowly brought her hand up to comb through some of Miki&#39;s 
long hair. She could feel her sister smile as she did so. Miki placed her own hand on 
Alice&#39;s stomach with a groan. &quot;Can I give you one last present...? You were the greatest 
sister...&quot;

      Miki didn&#39;t get a response for Alice had passed out from shock and the wound, but 
that was alright. Her dark eyes spied the timer on the charges had started... there wasn&#39;t 
much time left for them. 

***** 

      &quot;...that&#39;s horrible,&quot; Eveon whispered. &quot;The three of them died in that building?&quot;

      The fake Miki just gave her a wry smile. &quot;You could say that... Miki isn&#39;t really 
dead though,&quot; she said before suddenly lifting up her shirt.

      &quot;Whoa! I know Mina&#39;s currently out of the picture and I&#39;m grieving her lack of a free 
will, but now isn&#39;t the time to try to console me!&quot; Eveon exclaimed until she noticed the 
mark on Miki&#39;s lower stomach.

      &quot;Miki&#39;s soul lies right here,&quot; she said. &quot;Lilith may have Miki&#39;s half demon, half 
angel powers, but I have her actual soul as a core.&quot;

      Eveon just stared at her in confusion before the other girl asked, &quot;You still have 
Mariah&#39;s spell book?&quot;

      The blonde handed it over without a word to the fake Miki. She began to take out a 
few pictures and showed them to Eveon. &quot;That&#39;s Miki... this is Alice... and that&#39;s Mariah.&quot;

      Eveon froze up, shocked. &quot;W-wait, but you... you&#39;re...?&quot;

      &quot;I guess I&#39;ll introduce myself properly,&quot; the green eyed girl said, sitting up. &quot;My 
name&#39;s Alice Bailey and it&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot; 

***** 

      It took a while for the last leg of the operation to arrive and Alice had to reveal 
to everyone, thanks to Eveon&#39;s prompting, that she really wasn&#39;t Miki.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she repeated to Marx. &quot;I needed the Shadow Organization to suspect that 
I was a hybrid and not enhanced like Lilith.&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; he said waving it off. &quot;Just keep Miki&#39;s soul safe... that&#39;s all I ask.&quot;

      &quot;I suppose we can worry about that later,&quot; Faye suddenly cut in, holding up a plastic 
bag. &quot;We got Chinese take out!&quot;

      And that was how they all ended up sitting in an oblong circle on the floor, eating 
away. Alice was rather tense since she was sitting across from the sisters, who kept giving 
her funny looks and asking her about her true past. At least Eveon was next to her and the 
dangerous couple, Erin and Faye, weren&#39;t paying her any mind...

      In fact, the two goddesses were preoccupied with feeding Dark a variety of things. 
The angel looked fluster at some of the seasoned pieces of chicken being put into her mouth 
since she was unused to their bold flavors. Alice watched it for a moment before letting 
out a sigh.

      &quot;Hey,&quot; Josh called out to her after swallowing some fried rice. &quot;Didn&#39;t this mess 
start with you trying to save Dark?&quot;

      Alice froze. That really was the beginning of it all... &quot;I was originally looking 
into the Project Angelus files when Dark&#39;s name popped up.&quot;

      The angel perked up at the sound of her name. Marx heard her and nodded. &quot;That... 
would make sense...&quot; he said rather awkwardly.

      &quot;I couldn&#39;t let them torture her, so when I rescued Eveon and Sakura wouldn&#39;t help 
me...&quot; Alice trailed off. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Eveon. If it weren&#39;t for me, none of this would have 
happened.&quot;

      Dark interrupted in a soft voice. &quot;But I... I was the one who gave you the seal-&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; the blonde said, rather curtly. &quot;The last thing I want is for people to 
keep telling me their sorry. We need to plan to save Mina.&quot;

      With that, the conversation began to smooth out into pleasanter things. Sakura soon 
became intrigued at the sight of Faye and Erin feeding Dark. The angel&#39;s face turned red as 
she ate a particularly spicy piece of food. Sakura fumbled with her chopsticks slightly 
before picking up a piece of chicken.

      Abby laughed lightly to herself as Sakura held it up to her mouth. The blonde 
gratefully took it and watched in amusement as Sakura did the same for Eveon. The younger 
girl took it awkwardly, but smiled anyway. When Tycara&#39;s turn came, she beamed happily, 
having been deprived of motherly love while away with Seth and his group.

      When Sakura got a fourth piece of chicken, Seth was stunned when the Living Inferno 
held it up to him. The young man eyed the piece, thinking. He ate it, still giving Sakura a 
strange look. &quot;Uh... thanks for including me in the family... I guess...?&quot;

      &quot;Of course,&quot; she responded quietly. &quot;You&#39;re going to be my son-in-law, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

      Seth immediately froze up and Tycara seemed just as stunned before looking over at 
her boyfriend. &quot;Uh... I... I think that&#39;s a little fast,&quot; Seth said quickly, looking at 
Tycara. &quot;We love each other very much...&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s way too... too...&quot; Tycara trailed off, blushing. &quot;We still have lots of 
things to think about before that.&quot;

      Sakura tilted her head in slight confusion, staring right into Seth&#39;s eyes. &quot;But 
isn&#39;t it... the appropriate thing to do...?&quot;

      It was then that the young man realized that Sakura could now use her piercing gaze 
to see into his soul and now she knew that he-!

      &quot;After a couple consummates their love... that&#39;s what they should do.&quot; Sakura said 
indefinitely.

      Tycara went bright red as Seth gulped. Silence permeated through the room. Bakra and 
Josh exchanged glances, figuring that they would have to help Seth not get mutilated. Isaka 
dropped her chopsticks, staring straight ahead. &quot;...you did what...?&quot;

      Seth didn&#39;t respond as he could feel Tsuru&#39;s hot gaze on him as well. &quot;What did you 
and Tycara do?&quot; The Demon Lord asked calmly, barely concealing her hostile feelings.

      Now Isaka was glaring at him, thinking over what it all meant. Abby started to laugh. 
&quot;Seth, I didn&#39;t know you had it in you! Since Krystal remained a virgin in your care, I 
always thought you were impotent... nice to know you&#39;re a healthy boy taking care of 
Tycara.&quot;

      Seth barely had a second to spring to his feet as Isaka lunged at him and Tsuru tried 
to grab him. The young man scrambled over the couch trying to find a way to escape his much 
stronger counterparts. Bakra and Josh were trying to stop the women, while Tycara was 
chasing after them and Carmilla was jealously trying to restrain Tsuru.

      &quot;You little-! I&#39;m going to keep my threat!&quot; Isaka shouted. &quot;I hope you enjoy your new 
life as a girl!&quot;

      &quot;How could you take advantage of her?!&quot; Tsuru cried out before turning to Isaka. 
&quot;I&#39;ll hold him down and you cast that spell.&quot;

      &quot;No!!!&quot; Tycara yelled. &quot;I wanted to do it! I wanted to do it with Seth! You can&#39;t 
turn him into a girl!&quot;

      &quot;The only person you should be getting jealous of is me...!&quot; Carmilla whined out, 
blocking Tsuru&#39;s path.

      &quot;Just you wait, pretty boy! You&#39;re going to make an awesome female so you can never 
ever ever violate Tycara again!&quot; Isaka cried out as Bakra and Josh held onto her tightly.

      Tycara had proceeded to run with Seth into their room and lock the door.

      &quot;Gah! They could be having sex in there right now...!&quot; Tsuru moaned out, trying to 
escape from Carmilla&#39;s grasp. Since the Demon Lord was much too strong to hold back, the 
vampire came up with a much different plan.

      Tsuru let out a cry that dissolved into a submissive whimper as Carmilla suckled at 
her neck gently. Krystal let out a sigh. &quot;I suppose if feeding Tsuru blood makes her kinky 
and dominate, then sucking her blood must make her submissive...&quot;

      Carmilla was wincing at the taste, but she settled back down on the floor, holding 
Tsuru tenderly to her chest, stroking the Demon Lord&#39;s hair. &quot;...submissive ninny,&quot; Isaka 
growled out, now being held to the floor by Bakra and Josh.

      &quot;Aren&#39;t you overreacting?&quot; Krystal asked gently and Isaka frowned.

      &quot;I just can&#39;t believe they did it and Tycara didn&#39;t tell but she knew how upset I 
would be if she slept with Seth and... I&#39;m so turning him into a girl!&quot;

      In a desperate attempt to save her long time best friend, Krystal smiled. &quot;Well, Seth 
would make an awfully cute,&quot; she said fondly, pretending to imagine it.

      Out of her peripheral vision, Krystal could see the pale and worried looks on the 
demon&#39;s face. Isaka didn&#39;t take long to recant her idea. &quot;M-Maybe that wouldn&#39;t be such a 
good idea...!&quot;

      &quot;Afraid of the competition?&quot; Abby asked nonchalantly.

      &quot;I&#39;m better than any man!&quot; Isaka proclaimed as Bakra and Josh let her go. &quot;I don&#39;t 
see what&#39;s so great about guys anyway.&quot;

      &quot;Isaka,&quot; Bakra said with a grin. &quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing.&quot;

      Alice had long gone back to eating her food, terrified. &quot;This... this is what they do 
to straight people...?&quot; she whispered to Eveon.

      &quot;Just Seth,&quot; the blonde girl replied. &quot;He gets screwed over all the time, but I&#39;m 
glad him and my sister got together.&quot;

      &quot;...sister...?&quot; Alice asked, not seeing the relationship.

      &quot;Long as hell story,&quot; Eveon said with a sigh. &quot;Sakura impregnated my mommy.&quot;

      Alice decided she would just go back to the Chinese food and pretend none of the 
following had happened.
