<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Jessica woke up bright and early, it didn&#39;t seem to matter how late she 
stayed up she would always wake up with the sun. She stretched while 
gazing out of the window at the bright new day, the trees in the 
distance showing the first colours of fall. She smiled as the sounds of 
movement came drifting in from the hall outside her room. The girls 
would be waking up at their own paces and the sound of activity 
brightened Jessica&#39;s morning even more. She had grown accustom to the 
morning rituals of the Western Dorms. She had been part of the dorms for 
so many years now that she felt a little saddened when Head Mistress 
Sophia informed her a few months back that she would be free to leave at 
the end of the year. She had passed almost every one of her classes and 
was doing better emotionally and as such the Head Mistress decided there 
was not much more they could do for her.

She picked up her glasses off the desk, placed them upon her face and 
smiled as her eyes focussed on Kris, still curled up in bed. Her smile 
was quickly replaced by a frown as she scanned the girl&#39;s sleeping form. 
Kris was sprawled out in the bed with one leg curled up close and the 
other stretched out behind her. She was lightly dressed in only a pair 
of boxers, with one leg hidden under the crumpled blanket and a pillow 
was clenched tightly between the girl&#39;s arms, hiding her breast from 
view. She wore no other clothes, not even a bra. 

Jessica ran her fingers through her hair as she tried to think of how 
she was going to help this girl pull herself back together, she could 
barely understand Kris&#39;s sorrows so didn&#39;t even know where to begin. She 
finally decided that, for now, the best thing to do was to not let Kris 
brood over things too much. She needed to keep Kris from slipping deeper 
into depression and the only way she knew how to do that was to keep the 
girl busy.

She crossed the room, with the intention to wake her roommate, only to 
find herself stopping at the edge of Kris&#39;s bed, her eyes moving over 
Kris&#39;s practically nude form. She bit her lower lip as she scanned her 
roommate over, taking in Kris&#39;s rather athletic body, her thin waist, 
sturdy legs, smooth white skin and large winged black tattoo upon her 
back, a mark of the angel of death that she used to be. Jessica forced 
her eyes to move to Kris&#39;s face, there was something about the way the 
girl&#39;s short curly light blue hair hung over her face made Jessica&#39;s 
heart ache. She had noticed the pang in her heart growing ever more 
furious since their return from the woods and shook the feeling away. In 
her mind this girl was as taken as someone with a ring upon her hand, 
she would only make Kris&#39;s life more complicated. Jessica sat down upon 
the girl&#39;s bed and simply watched Kris sleeping face for a few moments 
longer, wondering if she was dreaming peacefully. Jessica struggled with 
the temptation to run a finger along Kris&#39;s outstretched leg to wake her 
up or even kiss her softly on the forehead. She did not have to fight 
long when Kris began to stir.

Kris&#39;s eyes slowly opened and began to focus on the person poised at the 
edge of her bed, &quot;Oh morning Jessica.&quot; Kris groggily said with a 
stretch, knocking the pillow to the ground unveiling her small chest 
before her roommate&#39;s eyes, &quot;Did I sleep in too long?&quot; She asked with a 
yawn, looking up at the girl. 

&quot;No.&quot; Jessica quickly turned her head and got to her feet, &quot;I was just 
about to wake you, was all.&quot; She tried to hide her face from Kris so her 
roommate wouldn&#39;t see the redness that had spread across her cheeks. In 
all her life she never blushed over seeing another girl&#39;s breasts 
before, and yet at that moment she felt embarrassed to have been staring 
at her roommate. Not wanting to think about it she hastily grabbed a 
pair of light brown cargo pants off a bed post, then a black tank top 
from the floor and got dressed, &quot;Breakfast should be ready soon you 
might want to get dressed.&quot; Jessica did not turn around as she spoke, 
worried that Kris may notice the blush upon her face; &quot;I have to give 
the girls their allowance so I&#39;ll see you downstairs.&quot; She snatched up a 
small ring of keys off a hook near the door and quickly exited the room 
before Kris could ask her what was bothering her. She closed the door 
behind her and leaned against it, trying to shake the feelings from 
growing inside of her, but she was afraid it was already too late. She 
closed her eyes against the depression that surfaced in her mind, &quot;Why 
her?&quot; She thought as she struggled with her emotions. Never before had 
Jessica been affected by a girl like this. She kept her heart locked 
down and the key buried deep in the ground, this should not be happening 
to her. 

&quot;Jessie, are you alright?&quot; A girl inquired as she came down the hall. 
Jessica opened her eyes to find a worried face staring back at her. The 
girl, around nineteen, just a year older then Jessica, had a towel 
clenched around her body and pushed dripping wet bangs of brunette hair 
over her ear.

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine, Misty.&quot; Jessica forced herself to smile to reassure the 
girl, &quot;You&#39;d better hurry or you&#39;ll be late for morning tennis 
practise.&quot; She reminded the girl.

Misty approached Jessica; not letting her eyes off of the dorm head&#39;s, 
&quot;I don&#39;t have tennis today remember?&quot; The girl reminded Jessica, giving 
her a curious gaze. The door to the room next door opened causing both 
girls to glance in that direction and Alyson stepped into the hall, 
dressed in leather pants and a tight white t-shirt and nodded coolly to 
the two girls before heading down the hall in the direction of the 
showers. 

Jessica let out a sigh of relief; &quot;She is not the friendliest of girls, 
now is she?&quot; She remarked watching Alyson continue down the hall and 
needing to turn away from those tight leather pants, &quot;Sorry to have to 
room the two of you together.&quot; She apologized to Misty while rubbing her 
head. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; Misty replied, still watching Alyson move down the hall, 
&quot;I must admit she is quite the looker and those leathers...&quot; She let out 
a shivered sigh then turned back to Jessica and moved in closer, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry about her. I&#39;m more worried about you. What&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ve never 
seen you with such pain in your eyes.&quot;

Jessica shook her head and rubbed at her temples, &quot;I&#39;m just having a bad 
morning.&quot; She stated, not really wanting to talk about the miserable 
state of her mind.

&quot;Come to my room.&quot; Misty invited with a mischievous grin and took 
Jessica by the hand, &quot;Alyson will be gone for a while, knowing her, and 
no one will find you in there.&quot; She ensured while she pulled Jessica 
down the hall, without much protest, and then entered Misty&#39;s room. 
Where she closed the door and locking it. 

Jessica flopped upon Misty&#39;s bed and stared at the ceiling, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. 
I&#39;m just out of it today.&quot; She admitted still not able to get Kris out 
of her mind when a towel fell on her head and she pulled it off to see 
Misty standing at a dresser mirror as she fixed her hair, completely 
naked. Jessica tossed the towel onto a chair and watched her friend run 
a comb through her shoulder length wavy hair. Jessica could not help 
letting her eyes wander over the girl&#39;s body. She was athletic, like 
Kris, however was shorter, had a thinner build, yet larger breast. 
Jessica suddenly got to her feet, walked up behind Misty and wrapped her 
arms around the girl&#39;s waist, slipping one hand down the girl&#39;s thigh. 

Misty turned around in the girl&#39;s arms and gazed into Jessica&#39;s eyes, 
&quot;Something is really bothering you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She reached up and gently 
touched Jessica&#39;s cheek. 

Jessica simply nodded. She felt in agony, something was boiling up in 
her chest to a point that it felt like she would burst if she didn&#39;t do 
something about it. 

Jessica&#39;s mouth quivered as Misty moved in closer, a grin upon her face, 
&quot;It has been months.&quot; Misty said with a fake pout. &quot;I thought you didn&#39;t 
need me anymore.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Jessica closed her eyes and tried to force down a growing 
lump in her throat. This was not the answer and yet she felt if she left 
the room she would crumble to the ground and would not be able to pull 
herself back together again, &quot;I always need you.&quot; Jessica admitted 
guilty. She could not understand herself, why she found herself needing 
to be in the arms of another. She thought she had finally overcome this 
need, this hunger and yet here she was. She ran a finger up Misty&#39;s back 
causing the girl to shiver in delight. A grin crossed Jessica face and 
she licked at her teeth. 

&quot;I am always yours.&quot; Misty remarked as she wrapped her arms around 
Jessica&#39;s neck and kissed her deeply. Jessica pulled the girl in 
hungering for the taste, a rush of heat racing through her body. 

It was like a drug to Jessica and she was in need of a real fix. Her 
body shivered as Melissa traced circles under her shirt and Jessica 
picked the girl up off the ground, not breaking free of the kiss, then 
led her to the bed. As Jessica placed kisses along Misty&#39;s neck and 
lowered the girl to the bed she could feel a small pang of guilt of the 
actions she was taking, however as the image of Kris entered her head 
again she found it impossible to resist the hunger and let the emotions 
take over her. She crawled into the bed with Misty and pulled off her 
shirt, tossing it to the floor. 

Without warning Misty attacked Jessica&#39;s breasts, nipping at her nipples 
playfully only to have Jessica quickly pull away. Jessica ran a finger 
along the girl&#39;s inner thigh and up to her panty line, lightly brushing 
the edge of Misty&#39;s pubic hairs causing the girl to let out a shivered 
moan. Misty pulled herself up to Jessica&#39;s ear and whispered lightly, 
&quot;Please... I want you...&quot; She requested lightly licking at Jessica&#39;s ear 
lobe. Understanding the request Jessica slipped her middle finger 
between Misty&#39;s outer lips and gently rubbed Misty&#39;s clitoris with the 
tip of her finger. Misty bit down on Jessica&#39;s neck, not hard enough to 
break skin but enough to a small amount of pain to run through Jessica. 
Deciding to forgo the foreplay Jessica plunged two fingers deep inside 
of Misty causing the girl to clench onto Jessica&#39;s tightly and bit her 
lip against a moan that tried to escape her. Jessica continued to slide 
her fingers deeper into the girl, enjoying the feeling of cum coating 
her fingers. She licked her lips at the thought of the taste as the 
scent of sweet cum filled her nostrils and she could no longer resist 
its call. She hungered for the sweetness filling her mouth and coating 
her tongue then, without removing her fingers, she released Misty from 
her embrace and moved her head towards Misty&#39;s crotch. 

&quot;Uhhh... Jessie?&quot; Misty was startled by Jessica&#39;s sudden attack. Her 
eyes grew large as she realized what it was Jessica was intending to do 
and swallowed in anticipation. Jessica twisted her hand around inside of 
Misty, using her free hand to pull the girl&#39;s outer lips open she 
quivered at the sight of pink flesh. She could see the clitoris peeking 
out from its hiding place and moved in quickly before it could hide 
again. Misty squirmed as Jessica&#39;s tongue found her clitoris and she 
began to suck it. Misty arched her back as a sensation of pleasure 
filled her entire being. She could feel Jessica&#39;s fingers still 
thrusting inside of her, occasionally twisting one way or the other, and 
tongue circling around her clitoris. Misty clenched her eyes shut 
gripped at the sheets as a wave of enjoyment rushed over her.

&quot;J... Je-Ssie!!!&quot; Misty&#39;s voice jutted up a notch as Jessica&#39;s pinkie 
finger pushed lightly against the rim of her anus, &quot;W... wa...wait!!!&quot; 
She could feel an orgasm building up in the pit of her stomach, her 
breath coming out in pants and moans. Jessica lifted her head for a 
moment to catch her breath, &quot;M... More...&quot; Misty managed to beg, not 
wanting the girl to break away. 

&quot;You want more?&quot; Jessica grinned naughtily and inserted her index finger 
into Misty&#39;s vagina causing Misty&#39;s hips to move with the rhythm of 
Jessica&#39;s fingers. 

Misty nodded her head vigorously, &quot;Please don&#39;t stop.&quot; She pleaded, she 
could feel herself at the cusp and she needed Jessica&#39;s tongue to help 
her over the edge. 

Obedient to her ladies desires Jessica lowered her head and began to 
suck upon the delicious ball of pink flesh. Misty let out a squeal of 
delight as she trashed about. Jessica would not let go of her hips, 
holding them close to her face. Finally the girl arched her back one 
last time in the fit of an orgasm and flopped back down onto the bed. 
Exhausted. Jessica lifted her head to smile upon Misty&#39;s flushed face. 
She curled up next to Misty and rested her head upon the girl&#39;s 
shoulder. The hunger had been satisfied, for the moment.
