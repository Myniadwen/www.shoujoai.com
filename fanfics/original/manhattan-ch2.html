The perky redheaded news reader beamed as she
continued, &quot;The war in Europe is going well, the
fascist British dissidents losing ground on several
fronts.&quot; She became a bit more serious as she
concluded her broadcast, &quot;Today&#39;s danger level is Red,
I repeat, Red. Remember, when the police ask you
questions you must reply, or risk arrest. Cooperation
with the authorities is what all good citizens do, and
if you do not, you are a bad citizen....&quot;

... there was a burst of static across the screen and
the regional news broadcast disappeared, replaced by
the national news desk. A younger man sits there
behind the curved desk, keeping his face carefully
neutral. Down in the corner of the screen there was a
stylized symbol, the letters &#39;GNN.&#39;

&quot;This is Matt Fields,&quot; the brown haired young man said
a little stiffly, &quot;in a special bulletin on the Global
News Network.&quot;

On cue the banner appears above his head on the screen
reading &#39;California in Crisis&#39; and split screen
effects are used to show events over the past few
days. There was rioting, burning buildings and in one
very disturbing scene, a dead little girl.

Matt looked towards the viewer, almost radiating
trustworthiness as he gently tapped the documents on
the desk. &quot;Less than a week ago California was
peaceful.&quot; he said to them dramatically, &quot;entirely
unaware of the enemy within.&quot;

Stock footage of various university campuses appear on
the screen as he smoothly continues in a voice-over,
&quot;Due to an dangerous upswing in radical, treasonous
tendencies in universities and the subversion of our
noble educational institutions by foreign terrorists,
the President was forced to dispatch National Guard
troops to restore order.&quot;

They cut back to the newsroom where Matt was looking a
little frayed around the edges. Looking down at the
sheets in front of him he read out, &quot;In response to
threat to their life and limb the Guard units opened
fire on student dissidents....&quot;

Matt trailed off, seemingly unable to read any more as
he clenched his hands on top of the desk. From the
side a woman&#39;s voice softly called off, &quot;Read it, damn
it, that&#39;s what the President&#39;s media secretary
approved.&quot; A moment&#39;s pause, &quot;We can&#39;t afford to have
our license to broadcast in the states pulled, or
worse.&quot;

&quot;Damn it, I have family in California,&quot; Matt looked up
with new determination of his face. &quot;The National
Guard opened fire on unarmed students,&quot; he said
firmly, &quot;who were only using their rights of free
speech and assembly.&quot;

Weakly from the side, &quot;Oh no....&quot;

Continuing on Matt said, &quot;The President attempted to
mobilize the California Army reserves to stop riots
that broke out over the shootings, but they have
instead chosen to protect the protesters. We&#39;ve just
found out that the Governor of California and the
house of Representatives have voted to succeed from
the United States.&quot;

&quot;Cue footage,&quot; the woman ordered, &quot;we&#39;re in deep
already, might as well finish it.&quot;

Cut to the front steps of a government building in
California where a older man stands, two army officers
who are obviously bodyguards nearby. &quot;The United
States government has willfully violated the rights of
the citizens of California,&quot; the Governor said
gravely, &quot;and show no signs of changing their course.
It is with a heavy heart that I announce that in an
emergency session the House of Representatives voted
unanimously to pull out of the United States. This is
hopefully a emergency measure, until an investigation
into the shootings can determine who gave the orders
to fire.&quot;

&quot;For now the President isn&#39;t moving against
California,&quot; Matt said crisply, &quot;possibly due to fears
of further military desertions. An emergency
declaration is moving through the United Nations in
support of California, further tying the government&#39;s
hands.&quot;

&quot;Matt,&quot; the blonde haired older woman who had been
speaking came on camera, &quot;security shows military
police coming into the building!&quot;

Matt nodded grimly then looked at the camera, &quot;The
President doesn&#39;t want you to know about this, or the
rising movement against the current system.&quot; Banging
sounds off in the distance as he continues on, &quot;We&#39;ve
been ordered to kill stories about any successful
resistance strikes and protests or the growing
international condemnation of our policies.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re here!&quot;

Figures in uniform rushed into the room, quickly
spreading out. One grabbed the woman roughly even as
another hurried towards where Matt was sitting
resignedly. A third noticed that the camera was still
on and walked towards it, filling up the screen for a
second before the image cut off again in a burst of
static.

That was nearly a year ago.

Now Washington D.C. was burning, red light shining
against the night sky. Many historical monuments had
already fallen to combat, but efforts were being made
to try to preserve as much as they could as military
forces from around the country moved in towards the
White House.

Two figures waited tiredly in one of the many
encampments, trying to get something to eat and some
rest. &quot;So how did you get into this, Neil?&quot; Suzanne
asked, her blonde hair clipped short, her blue eyes
tired as she looked towards the young man. Neither one
wore traditional uniforms, just street clothes with a
simple cloth armband.

&quot;Probably the California broadcast on GNN,&quot; Neil
admitted, black hair falling into his eyes as he
leaned against the side of the building. He lit up a
cigarette and continued, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever
realized how bad things were really getting, until I
saw that. You?&quot;

There was a moment of silence as Suzanne took a drink
of her cup of juice. &quot;My lover was taken in a security
sweep,&quot; she said grimly from where she sat on a broken
piece of column, &quot;I did everything legal I could to
try and get her back.&quot; A short beat of silence then
she added bleakly, &quot;Then I moved on to illegal.&quot;

From the look on her face Neil knew that hadn&#39;t ended
happily, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;At least I found out about what happened to Rebecca,&quot;
Suzanne said quietly, &quot;there&#39;s still so many people
who&#39;ve lost love ones and don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;God,&quot; he sighed, cigarette glowing red in the
semi-darkness.

&quot;Any news on the Library of Congress?&quot; Suzanne asked,
finishing off her drink.

&quot;Sounds like they kept the federals from burning the
building,&quot; Neil smiled grimly, &quot;we&#39;ll need those
records to try and bring the President&#39;s inner circle
to justice.&quot;

&quot;I doubt they&#39;re going to live to reach trial,&quot;
Suzanne said, eyes alight with a dangerous glow.

A runner arrived before Neil could form an answer to
that statement, the teen nodding respectfully to Neil
before turning to Suzanne. &quot;Colonel.,&quot; he said, &quot;the
meeting is going to start soon.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Suzanne got up, wincing slightly.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Neil nodded, moving off to try to grab
some food.

&quot;What&#39;s the situation, Rafe?&quot; Suzanne asked, limping
slightly as the two figures made their way across the
encampment together.

Rafael Dacosta quickly summarized, &quot;They&#39;re debating
how to move on to the White House itself, ma&#39;am.&quot;

As he walked by her side Rafe thought about Suzanne,
the stories that were circulating about her. Over the
past three years she had practically built the east
coast resistance from the ground up, recruiting,
training and leading an elite team of operatives. Few
people had done more to push the President out of
office, but he often wondered what it had cost her.

&quot;About time,&quot; Suzanne nodded slightly.

&quot;There are representatives of the European news media
here, they&#39;d like to talk with you along with other
leaders,&quot; Rafe tentatively said.

&quot;No,&quot; Suzanne growled.

&quot;But ma&#39;am....&quot; Rafe pleaded.

Suzanne grit her teeth, &quot;They stood on the damn fence
for years, toeing the president&#39;s line, and only now
that he&#39;s on the ropes are they finally willing to
show some balls.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have balls,&quot; the amused female voice
commented as Rafe brought them to the primary
encampment. The tall young woman met their eyes
frankly, &quot;I have no illusions about how we acted in
the past, but we&#39;re trying to make up for it.&quot;

&quot;And who, exactly, are you?&quot; Suzanne frowned.

&quot;Heather Rice for the BCC,&quot; the redhead replied.
Softly she continued, &quot;We want your story, if only
because people need to know why this is happening.&quot;

&quot;Not interested,&quot; Suzanne snarled.

&quot;I&#39;ve already done some research,&quot; Heather spoke fast
as the woman was walking away, &quot;I have a good idea why
you&#39;re doing what you&#39;re doing.&quot; She chose her next
words carefully, &quot;But wouldn&#39;t it be better if you
told the story, if only for her memory?&quot;

Suzanne stood there for a moment, stiffly, as she
considered. &quot;All right,&quot; she finally conceded, &quot;let&#39;s
get this over with.&quot;

Rafe led them, to an empty tent, then excused himself.
Heather set up her recording gear and took a nervous
breath, &quot;Tell me what brought you here.&quot;

Suzanne closed her eyes, remembering a pain that had
never really gone away. &quot;For me, it began when they
came to take my lover away.....&quot;

End.

Authors Note: I should hang a sign on my wall saying,
&#39;Never say never.&#39; Many times I said I wasn&#39;t going to
continue &#39;First we take Manhattan&#39; but then the
opening scene of this story showed up in my head. This
story starts several months after the end of &#39;First&#39;
and then takes up the story about a year later, which
I hope is fairly believable.</pre>
