<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch43.html">Back to Part 43</a><pre>Kima searched the room that has suddenly become her new home, first 
testing the doorknob to find it securely locked and let out a frustrated 
sigh, and then began to examine the rest of the room in search of any 
way to escape this nightmare. The room turned out to be much larger then 
Kim first thought, there was a bunk bed off to one wall and the mattress 
on the ground. A single dresser stood again the opposite wall and one 
large window took up the far wall, which told Kima that it was now 
daylight again. There was a small washroom connected to the room with 
had a secondary door, which was also locked. Lastly there was a walk-in 
closet filled with ragged clothes, that Caitlin coward next too. When 
she was finally done her inspection she flopped back down on the 
mattress on the floor, &quot;So how long do they keep us locked up in here?&quot; 
She inquired frustrated with her situation.

&quot;We only have to stay here during the day.&quot; Amber stated from the 
bathroom as she drew a tub of water, &quot;They let us go into the living 
area from time to time.&quot; She tested the water, &quot;Water is almost ready, 
Kim.&quot;

Kima entered the washroom, the room had dirty yellow tiles and the tub 
looked rather old but cleans all the same. She glanced down at the large 
tub filled with steaming water and smiled, &quot;I miss having a bath.&quot; She 
remarked delighted with the prospect of soaking for a bit. Maybe she 
could figure out how to get out of this nightmare if she relaxed for a 
bit. 

&quot;It&#39;s one of the very few good things about this place.&quot; Amber stated 
half-heartedly, &quot;I hated having to use the showers at the orphanage.&quot; 
She remarked with a slight shudder, &quot;Here let me help you with that.&quot; 
She offered seeing Kima struggling with the numerous buttons of her 
pyjama top. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Kima said gratefully as she stepped closer to Amber. She was 
finding it difficult to get used to her tiny fingers again. 

Sarah stared at the two girls from the door curiously, &quot;Why did you run 
when I offered to help you undress but not Amber?&quot; She inquired bitterly

Kima startled slightly, &quot;I... I was just nervous.&quot; She gave a twitchy 
smile, &quot;A new place and all, you know?&quot; 

&quot;Sarah, leave her alone.&quot; Amber demanded, &quot;Go look for some clothes for 
Kim alright.&quot; 

&quot;Sure sure.&quot; Sarah said nonchalantly, then stepped away from the door to 
search Kim&#39;s suitcase for something for her to wear. 

&quot;Sorry about Sarah.&quot; Amber apologized, &quot;She can be a pain but is nice 
when it counts.&quot; She explained as she undid the last button of Kima&#39;s 
shirt, &quot;Do you want me to leave?&quot; She inquired moving for the door.

Kima shrugged as she pulled off the shirt, &quot;Doesn&#39;t bother me.&quot; She 
stated as she dropped the shirt to the floor then glanced at her baggy 
panties, &quot;Do you have a fresh pair?&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s a draw of them.&quot; Amber remarked, &quot;It&#39;s the only thing that we 
get new around here. Everything else is used clothes.&quot; 

Kima let out a sigh of relief, &quot;That&#39;s good to know.&quot; She pulled off the 
undergarment, and then climbed into the tub and halted, &quot;It&#39;s hot!&quot; She 
exclaimed needing a moment for her body to get used to the water. 

&quot;Sorry about that.&quot; Amber apologized as she watched the girl sink slowly 
into the water, &quot;If it&#39;s too much I can drain it and add some cold.&quot; She 
offered heading for the taps

Kima shook her head as the water rose around her body, &quot;It&#39;s nice.&quot; She 
stated with a smile. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be right out here if you need anything.&quot; Amber explained as she 
left the room. 

&quot;Thanks.&quot; Kim slowly sunk into the water up to her neck and lightly shut 
her eyes, allowing the heat to seep through her body. It felt good upon 
her skin and she slipped her head under the water leaving only her face 
above the surface. She drifted in the tub, letting her body to relax, 
the warm water was soothing to her mind and she felt like she could fall 
asleep floating there. The minutes passed by and the heat worked away at 
Kima&#39;s thoughts, enveloping them and washing away her worries and 
doubts. Slowly she began to wonder why she would ever want to leave this 
place, where was it that she was trying to get to in the first place? 
She began to forget that she was inside of a dream and felt more like 
she belong there all the time. This was her home and not the other 
world. Almost as if she was struck by a moment of clearness and she 
abruptly sat up. 

&quot;Is everything alright, Kim?&quot; Amber inquired going to the girl&#39;s side, 
&quot;You looked like you were sleeping so peacefully there.&quot; She admitted 
with a smile.

&quot;I just remembered how I got here.&quot; Kim stated, staring at the girl, &quot;I 
was sent here after my parents died. I remember finding them laying on 
the ground, there was blood everywhere.&quot; She glanced down shakily at her 
hands, &quot;It was all over my hands.&quot; She suddenly broke down into a fit of 
sobs, &quot;I was so alone... I don&#39;t want to be alone....&quot; 

Amber quickly wrapped her arms around the girl and hugged her, 
&quot;Shhhh...&quot; She cooed, &quot;It&#39;s alright. We are your family now.&quot; She 
stated, &quot;You will never be alone again.&quot;
