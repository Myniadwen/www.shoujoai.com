<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch48.html">Back to Part 48</a><pre>Jenn sobbed heavily into her pillow and punched at the bed, &quot;I&#39;m so 
stupid.&quot; She screamed into the pillow. 

Tanya sat upon the edge of the girl&#39;s bed and stroked her back, &quot;Your 
not stupid.&quot; Tanya replied, &quot;Kris is the stupid one.&quot; 

Cherilyn nodded in agreement, &quot;You should try to forget about her.&quot; She 
stated from her spot on a desk chair. 

Jenn rolled over and stared up at the ceiling, &quot;No, I was the stupid 
one&quot; She reiterated, &quot;She kept coming on to me and I was always afraid 
she was not interested. Always telling myself she was only teasing me. 
But what do I do? I play innocent and pretend like I didn&#39;t know what 
was going on.&quot; She slapped herself on the forehead, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with 
me? I let my fears get in the way and now I&#39;ve lost her.&quot; 

&quot;But that&#39;s not your fault.&quot; Tanya reminded the girl, &quot;You barely 
remembered where you came from, never mind your love for Kris. Your 
memories were being toyed with by those angels.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Jenn let out a sigh and place her arm over her eyes, &quot;But even 
when I started to remember I kept pushing it away. Kept telling myself 
that I was being foolish. There was no way she could ever love an idiot 
like me.&quot; 

Tanya pulled Jenn&#39;s arm away and looked her straight in the eyes, 
&quot;You&#39;re far from an idiot.&quot; She growled, &quot;I hate idiots and could never 
love one like I loved you.&quot; 

Jenn was startled by what she heard, &quot;Love me?&quot; 

Tanya staggered backwards alarmed by her own word and glanced at 
Cherilyn who looked away. She rubbed at the back of her neck in 
embarrassment. 

Jenn sat up to study the girl closely, &quot;Tanya? Did you just say you 
loved me?&quot; She inquired perplexedly. 

&quot;It was long ago.&quot; Tanya nervously replied. 

Cherilyn glared at the girl, &quot;Don&#39;t lie.&quot; She snapped, &quot;You&#39;ve always 
loved her and I know it.&quot;

&quot;Cherilyn???&quot; Tanya begged, &quot;You know I love you.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, but I&#39;ll always be second in your mind.&quot; Cherilyn remarked 
dismally then got to her feet, &quot;I&#39;m going to unpack. I&#39;ll talk to you 
later.&quot; 

&quot;Cherilyn wait!&quot; Tanya blocked the girl&#39;s escape, &quot;You know my heart is 
yours.&quot; She stated affectionately, lightly touching the girl&#39;s arm only 
to have it knocked away. 

&quot;You are always running to Jenn and you never think of my feelings.&quot; 
Cherilyn coldly stated, &quot;Every since she has come back it has been Jenn 
this and Jenn that. I came here to be with you and yet I see that you 
came here to be with her.&quot; 

&quot;Cherilyn, you are taking this the wrong way.&quot; Tanya stated in dismay, 
&quot;Anyway, Jenn doesn&#39;t love me. She still has Kimberly.&quot; 

Cherilyn shook her head in disappointment, &quot;So that is the only reason 
you stay with me then? Because the one you truly love is not available. 
Thanks a lot.&quot; Cherilyn pushed passed Tanya and ran out the door. 

&quot;Shit!&quot; Tanya kicked at the floor then glanced at Jenn who shook her 
head in appal, &quot;Jenn...&quot; Tanya slowly approached her friend. 

&quot;Don&#39;t...&quot; Jenn curled up in her bed, &quot;Just leave me alone.&quot; 

Tanya took a deep breath and let it out, &quot;A... alright...&quot; She 
reluctantly left the room, closing the door behind her. 

Jenn glanced across the room at Kimberly&#39;s bed and recalled the past 
couple of days. The girl willingly battled her way through Jenn&#39;s 
nightmares twice to save her and yet she seemed to have no more interest 
in Jenn other then friendship. The memory of Kim&#39;s kiss came to mind and 
Kima. She sat up straight. She did not remember seeing Kima in the lobby 
with her twin. Where was she? 

(She stayed behind with Penny.) 

Those were Jessica&#39;s exact words before they left the library world. 
Jenn suddenly got to her feet and walked out of the room, she needed to 
know what happened to her friend. She wanted to know that Kima was all 
right and needed to know now.
