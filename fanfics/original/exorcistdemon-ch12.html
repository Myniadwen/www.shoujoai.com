<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>      Isaka let out a monstrous yawn as she awoke. Recovering her true form had taken a lot 
energy out of her. She got up with a start when she realized her beautiful prize was nowhere 
to be found. Isaka&#39;s hand landed on something and she heard a distinct rustle. She bit her 
lip as she picked up the note in her bed. 

&#39;Dear Isaka,

      That trick you pulled wasn&#39;t so nice! But... I guess you mean well. I think. Anyways, 
I have to go back home so me and Seth left. Promise me you won&#39;t harm anymore innocent 
girls? I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to talk to me again, but... um... as long as you don&#39;t try 
to seduce me, we can be friends! 

Krystal&#39; 

      Only Krystal would write her such a note. The demon smiled and licked her lips. She 
could already picture it in her mind... her sweet, delicious Krystal all sprawled out on a 
bed and-

      &quot;You&#39;re having naughty thoughts again, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Her wonderful fantasy was 
shattered at the sound of Tycara&#39;s voice. &quot;Yes... but I&#39;m going to make them a reality,&quot; 
Isaka said, stroking Tycara&#39;s head. &quot;If only you knew what you were missing Ms. Straight.&quot;

      The half demon, half angel just pouted. &quot;But guys like Seth are so sweet! I can&#39;t help 
it.&quot; Isaka just frowned and lied back down. &quot;Seth. Why can&#39;t he get out of the way?&quot;

      Tycara just gave her secret smile. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s not going to be in the way.&quot; 
Isaka just gave her a flabbergasted look. &quot;What? Did you sleep with him?&quot;

      The silver haired girl went a bright red. &quot;NO!!!! I&#39;m w-waiting until I&#39;m married! He 
just- he just thinks that Krystal is in love with you, so I think he broke up with her to 
stay out of the way.&quot;

      The demon smiled devilishly. &quot;Really? Wow... that&#39;s perfect. I can have her all to 
myself and comfort her in her time of need.&quot; Isaka started to chuckle darkly while Tycara 
let out a sigh.

      She would never understand her big sister figure... 

***** 

      Krystal figured that after eating microwavable pizza and a half a gallon of ice cream, 
she would feel better. She figured wrong. All it did was give her a tummy ache and the 
television was making her cry at random times. She couldn&#39;t believe Seth had... had broken 
up with her. What had she done? She kept trying to tell herself that she just wasn&#39;t the 
kind of girl he liked, but...

      &quot;...here we go again...&quot; She whispered as her eyes watered for the umpteenth time. 
Krystal turned off the TV and threw away the empty ice cream carton along with her Styrofoam 
plate covered with the remains of pizza. The apartment was quite dark, but the crying blonde 
knew exactly where her room was. As she moved towards the general area of her doorway, she 
heard a slight rustle from behind her.

      Krystal turned, her face streaked with tears, only to see Isaka standing in her 
hallway. The demon was illuminated by moonlight coming from the window and her satin black 
nightgown only stood out more against her skin. &quot;...I got your note.&quot;

      Krystal just stood there, gaping at the demon as she stepped forward. She was ready to 
protest, but suddenly, Isaka&#39;s warm hands were on her shoulders. She stared into Isaka&#39;s 
lavender eyes and only let out a squeak of protest as her lips landed upon her own. Krystal 
stood there limp, surprised at how gentle it was. Slowly, she felt her own hands bunch at 
the fabric near Isaka&#39;s shoulders as the demon&#39;s hands flitted across her waist and stroked 
hair.

      Isaka&#39;s tongue teased her lips and Krystal wasn&#39;t quite sure what possessed her to 
part them. Of course, the following passion induced by her actions was gentle and loving. 
Krystal always thought that Isaka would be rough, not intimate... but why was she letting 
the demon kiss her in the first place?

      With that thought, Krystal slowly pulled away and stepped back, into her bedroom. 
&quot;Isaka... I...&quot; The demon just followed her in and closed the door silently. &quot;Shh...  it&#39;s 
alright...&quot; She murmured, reaching forward to cup Krystal&#39;s cheek. The exorcist relented and 
leaned into it as the demon embraced her again.

      Krystal tried to resist the kiss, but it was too much... she needed something... 
somebody and it felt so nice... She pulled away again, but Isaka caught her bottom lip and 
nibbled on it. Krystal&#39;s knees buckled and Isaka caught her. &quot;...let me take care of you...&quot; 
Krystal let out a slight sound of surprise at her words, but the demon only led her to her 
bed.

      Isaka let herself indulge on her vulnerable neck before moving up to those sweet, 
inviting lips. Krystal only let out sighs of pleasure and comfort as Isaka continued her 
affection. &quot;... do you... promise,&quot; she murmured out, &quot;...to take care of me?&quot;

      The demon lifted herself up so that she was hovering above Krystal. &quot;I promise.&quot; She 
leaned back down and took those soft lips with her own. 

***** 

      Krystal awoke after having such a strange dream... Isaka had gently seduced her and- 
The blonde woman blushed and laughed quietly. She&#39;d been so distraught over Seth that she 
dreamed of the demon making out with her? How strange! Her pajamas were a little askew, but 
that always happened when she slept. Now, it was time for breakfast...

      &quot;Hmm... look who&#39;s awake.&quot; Krystal almost suffered whiplash upon turning to see the 
sultry demon leaning against her doorframe. The night gown she had worn the night before was 
much more revealing than Krystal realized. Not to mention that she was suckling a strawberry 
while looking at her with &#39;that&#39; look. What happened to the gentle Isaka from the night 
before?

      &quot;Isaka! I! D-did that really happen?!&quot; The demon devoured the entire strawberry before 
walking over to her. &quot;Yes... yes it did,&quot; she said, holding a plate with strawberries and 
whipped cream in her hands. &quot;Oh my God... how could I-&quot; Krystal was cut off as Isaka placed 
a cream covered strawberry into her mouth.

      &quot;In case you were wondering... we didn&#39;t get much farther than kissing last night.&quot; 
Isaka could fondly remember that disappointing fact. In the middle of kissing Krystal, she 
let her hand slide down over her full breast before lightly squeezing it. When she looked up 
to make sure Krystal was okay with it, the exorcist was fast asleep.

      The demon watched in a trance as Krystal ate her strawberry and let out a sigh of 
relief. When the blonde flicked out her tongue to lick the whip cream on her fingers, she&#39;d 
almost had it. &quot;...because you fell asleep... I&#39;m a little tense now.&quot;

      Krystal looked at her guiltily then at her own fingers. &quot;...you don&#39;t understand how 
horny I am, Krystal.&quot; The blonde girl just laughed awkwardly.

      &quot;I-I&#39;m sorry?&quot; The demon just cupped her cheek and straddled her waist. &quot;If you&#39;re 
really sorry-&quot; Isaka moved her hips suggestively and Krystal started to flail underneath 
her. &quot;NO, NO, NO! Too soon, too soon!!&quot;

      She pouted as Krystal tried to escape from underneath her. Isaka really did need a 
release. She took in the image of Krystal sprawled out beneath her before getting up.

      &quot;...I&#39;ll be in the bathroom for a little while.&quot; 

***** 

      After Isaka finished using the bathroom (she seemed much happier after that) Krystal 
was awkwardly sitting next to her on the couch, watching TV. More like Isaka had trapped her 
in an embrace and the exorcist was pushed up against her bosom. The startling thing was that 
Krystal actually felt quite secure sitting in her lap with the demon&#39;s hand stroking her 
hair. That was the problem...

      &quot;...Isaka, I don&#39;t want you to get the wrong idea about last night...&quot; The demon just 
cocked an eyebrow at her. &quot;I-I mean... I was vulnerable and Seth had just broken up with me 
and it felt nice to have someone, so...&quot;

      &quot;You used me as a rebound?&quot; Krystal nodded, looking down into her lap. Isaka leaned 
into the young woman and her expression darkened. &quot;You know, there is a punishment for using 
people like that, especially demons like me.&quot;

      Krystal moved off her lap, scared at how angry Isaka had suddenly become. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
mean to... I-I just...!&quot; She was backed up on the other side of the couch, with the demon on 
top of her.

      &quot;That punishment is,&quot; Krystal felt Isaka&#39;s hands drift up her shirt, &quot;...not being 
able to ever be rid of me.&quot; Her look of anger suddenly dissolved into an expression more 
befitting of the Cheshire cat. Krystal suddenly realized she had been duped, but her mind 
became too preoccupied with the soft kiss on her lips. It was so passionate and welcoming 
that Krystal didn&#39;t notice Isaka&#39;s tongue had crept in on the occasion.

      Why did it give her so much pleasure to be with Isaka and lie in her arms? It felt... 
even better than with Seth. The thought scared her, but she just let out a happy sigh as 
Isaka&#39;s ministrations moved down to her neck. &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Isaka whispered into her ear, 
&quot;...I promised.&quot;
