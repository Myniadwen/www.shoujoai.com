<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Alice Sinclare paused at the edge of what might be
thought of as the bad side of town, the black haired
woman dressed in a fine business suit checking a slip
of paper with the address that she had jotted down.
&#39;Looks like this is it,&#39; she noted, walking forward
again.

The office she was looking for was in an older
building, the high-rise clearly having seen better
days and the once elegant facade fallen into
disrepair. Walking forward she looked around the
lobby, noting with some disgust that the elevator was
out of order, Alice took the stairs up to the floor
where Yamazaki Investigations waited.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; he looked up from his work with a
smile as she entered the outer office, the older man
who was sitting there at the reception desk with a
half finished box of donuts nearby, &quot;welcome to
Yamazaki Investigations.&quot; His clothes consisted of a
wrinkled business suit, all in basic black much like
his thinning hair.

&quot;Alice Sinclare,&quot; she introduced herself with a formal
nod and asked him, &quot;I think I have an appointment for
ten A.M.?&quot;

&quot;Tom,&quot; he introduced himself with a charming smile,
&quot;come on, I think the boss is in.&quot; He smoothly got up,
casually picking up his coffee and drinking as he led
her past the desk to a short hallway and a door marked
&#39;Lucy Yamazaki, head investigator.&#39; He knocked on the
door and called out, &quot;Boss, your ten o&#39;clock is in.&quot;

&quot;Come in,&quot; she called and Tom opened the door, waving
Alice in.

The woman who got up from behind her desk and walked
over to offer her hand, her business suit clinging to
her body. Full breasts pressed against her pure white
blouse, the dark blue skirt hugging legs that almost
seemed to go for miles. Full glossy lips matched her
dark red hair, her natural scent earthy and warm and
her gaze was filled with a kind of unbridled
sensuality.

&quot;Miss Sinclare,&quot; Lucy smiled warmly as she studied
her, her dark hair falling in waves down her back,
&quot;take a seat, please.&quot;

Alice thanked her as she sat, hoping that her recent
tears weren&#39;t too visible. &quot;Thank you for seeing me on
such short notice,&quot; she said with a sigh.

&quot;I have an associate who frequents your bookstore,&quot;
Lucy sat on the edge of her desk, the pose giving her
a sexy sort of style, &quot;it&#39;s the least I could do.&quot; She
paused as she studied Alice, &quot;You mentioned a
background check when we talked on the phone?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Alice hesitated, &quot;it&#39;s... somewhat delicate.&quot;

&quot;Our client confidentiality is assured,&quot; Lucy calmly
reassured her even as she studied Alice thoughtfully.

Alice felt the faint beginnings of a blush under the
other woman&#39;s gaze. It wasn&#39;t that she was attracted
to the woman, it was just that she was so
unconsciously sexy it was a bit distracting. Taking a
steadying breath Alice said, &quot;I&#39;ve recently become
involved with someone, we&#39;ve been seeing each other
for a few months.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Lucy made a sound of acknowledgment, like any
good interviewer prompting her to go on without
influencing her.

Uncomfortably Alice continued on, &quot;Recently I got
something of a surprise from her, not a good one.&quot; She
sighed, &quot;I suddenly realized I&#39;ve been assuming a lot
of things about her, really without any basis in
fact.&quot;

&quot;And so you want us to do the background check,&quot; Lucy
nodded. She smiled, &quot;Did you bring us any information
we could start with?&quot;

Alice felt a bit of relief at the woman&#39;s more
business-like manner. &quot;Here&#39;s a recent photo, address
of her place of business and a list of her friends
I&#39;ve met,&quot; Alice passed the sheet and photo over as
she added, &quot;her name is Jess Drake.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lucy took the sheets calmly.

The detective had a remarkable poker face but Alice
thought she noticed a flicker of something when she
mentioned Jess&#39; name. &quot;Do you know Jess?&quot; she asked
softly.

&quot;Only by reputation,&quot; Lucy answered calmly. She
smiled, &quot;We&#39;ll take the case, ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll have a
preliminary report ready within a week or so, as well
an rough idea of how long it&#39;ll take to do a full
report on her.&quot;

Alice smiled in honest relief, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; She took
out her cheque book and asked, &quot;How much do I owe you
for a retainer?&quot;

&quot;Background checks are normally just a flat fee,&quot; Lucy
smiled as she admitted, &quot;but I think this may be a bit
more time consuming.&quot; She considered a second, &quot;How
about two hundred to start, then we&#39;ll see how it
goes?&quot;

Alice wrote out a cheque for five hundred and passed
that over, &quot;This should cover several days work, at
least. Contact me as soon as you need more.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Lucy nodded gracefully. They talked for
awhile, Lucy gently extracting more details from her
about Jess then escorted her out.

Alice felt an odd sort of relief as she headed up the
street, going back to Sisterhood books. &#39;It feels good
to be doing something,&#39; she thought, trying very
firmly not to think about the shocked, painful look on
Jess&#39; face when she slapped her last night.



&quot;You did WHAT?&quot; Tom blurted, looking at his boss in
shock as they held a post interview meeting in Lucy&#39;s
office.

&quot;We&#39;ve been hired to do a full background check on
Jess Drake,&quot; Lucy repeated as she waved the photo
casually, &quot;it&#39;s all fairy simple, so don&#39;t make me get
out the dictionary and help you with the longer words,
Tom.&quot;

Dramatically Tom flopped down in the chair usually
used for customers. &quot;You do know who Drake is, right?&quot;
he asked.

&quot;No,&quot; Lucy answered, &quot;and neither do you, really.&quot;

That made Tom stop, then he finally nodded. &quot;Point,&quot;
he conceded, &quot;there are all those rumors about her and
her reputation, but that&#39;s about it.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Lucy nodded. Her expression was
calculating, &quot;Just imagine how some of the movers and
shakers in the city would react to knowing the dirt on
Jess Drake?&quot;

Tom rolled his eyes at that idea. &quot;So how do you want
to go about this?&quot; he asked her crisply, already
considering the shape the investigation would take.

&quot;Google the name Jess Drake and I want to know who on
paper owns Jess&#39; Tattoo parlor,&quot; Lucy said crisply,
&quot;it&#39;s possible that the Drake name is an alias.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Tom looked curious to see where that was going.

Lucy smiled slightly, &quot;Jess as in ties, restrains and
Drake means dragon. A magician who&#39;s name just happens
to mean &#39;bound dragon&#39; makes me a bit suspicious.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll hack into city hall records, too,&quot; Tom noted. He
paused, &quot;Should I approach any of our contacts with
the Lady Diana&#39;s organization?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Lucy shook her head firmly, &quot;not with their
whole situation involving the priest and demon going
on. They might decide we&#39;re freelancers looking for
work.&quot;

Tom got up, his mind already occupied with planning
out his online search. &quot;Oh,&quot; he suddenly remembered,
&quot;is Rose going to be involved?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll contact her,&quot; Lucy assured him.

Tom headed out to his desk and turned to the computer
perched on the edge of his desk. Looking like an older
model it was oddly out of place, but looks were
deceiving. Inside of that battered old casing was the
latest in hardware as well as some modifications that
were quite possibly gray-market if not illegal.

&#39;Hmm,&#39; Tom thought as he worked, &#39;I thought I saw Rose
go into Lucy&#39;s office earlier.&#39;

Lucy waited a few moments then turned towards her desk
and with a impish little smile called out, &quot;All&#39;s
clear, lover.&quot;

A naked Rose crawled out from under the desk, her face
still glistening with fluids. &quot;Gods,&quot; she got up,
stretching, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you interviewed that
woman with no panties on!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just glad she was too distracted to notice you,&quot;
Lucy chuckled, gently stroking brown hair away from
the other woman&#39;s face.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rose gasped as Lucy pulled her forward,
delicately licking the juices from her face. &quot;You&#39;re
insatiable,&quot; she gasped as hands slid down.

&quot;And you love it,&quot; Lucy laughed. She sauntered back to
her leather chair and sat down, smiling up at Rose
with a hungry look.

&quot;What?&quot;

Lucy let her legs spread, revealing glistening, wet
flesh as she purred, &quot;Do you want to get back to what
we were doing?&quot;</pre>
