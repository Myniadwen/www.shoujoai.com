<pre>(Hiya, Hiya, Hiya everyone, this is my first ever completely original 
fic and I hope you like it. I&#146;ve decided to dedicate it to my very own 
special someone who I have also based one of the characters on, and who 
is responsible for so much of my inspiration for this story. Thank you 
ever so much Madison, you mean the world to me)

MJ Dilemma (part 1)

A boy about sixteen years of age walked through the quiet stone grey 
corridors of his high school with a yellow slip of paper in his hand. 
His name was Stephen. He wasn&#146;t exactly the tallest of people, standing 
only at 5&#146; 8 &#150; the shortest of his friends &#150; he had short messy brown 
hair and dark hazel eyes. He had never considered himself handsome in 
anyway but he wasn&#146;t short on female admirers.

He was in school to have his leavers form signed so that he would 
officially have left the school. The college that he wished to go to had 
already given him a place but it wasn&#146;t to start for a good few weeks 
yet. He wore a large grin on his face for he was finally getting out of 
high school and moving on to grander thing, all he had left to sign his 
form was the Assistant Head.

As he walked through the history department an irregular yellow glow 
caught his attention, it was coming from the room to his left, and the 
number read 13. His old history room and it didn&#146;t hold too many happy 
memories for him after all history wasn&#146;t exactly his strongest subject.

Curious, he took a few steps closer and the glow started to brighten. 
All of his senses were telling him to just turn around and leave but his 
curiosity won over, he reached the door and looked through the small 
window and there he saw his old history teacher. She was reading 
something, an old book but what was strange was that the glow was coming 
from the book and as she spoke grew stronger.

&#147;What&#146;s going&#133;&#148;

Just then a bright flash engulfed the area and forced him to shield his 
eyes, and then a powerful force struck him in the chest and mind 
crippling pain shot through his entire body all at once. He struck the 
wall but didn&#146;t slide down it; it was as if the force was holding him to 
the wall. He felt area on his chest stretch and his body&#146;s structure 
bending and contracting, changing his very being. The light burned so 
bright now that it burned his skin and blood trickled down from the 
corners of his mouth as he grew two fangs on his upper teeth right next 
to his canines, and a sharp pain shot into a small circle at the top of 
his pelvis where his spine met it, he heard a rip and more pain coursed 
through his body. He tried to yell in pain but the voice that emitted 
from his mouth wasn&#146;t his own, his eyes burned as they too changed and 
he felt the pain intensify in his chest, he felt like he was going to 
die&#133;

&#147;AHHHH!&#148;

Stephanie screamed as she awoke from her recurring nightmare, her body 
covered in a cold sweat and her breath coming in pants. She had been 
having the same nightmare ever since the event one year ago, ever since 
that strange light changed her from male to female. She took on the name 
Stephanie to stop the stares she&#146;d get when people called her Stephen 
although the other changes that the light made to her also earned her a 
few odd stares.

She pushed the covers from her body and swung her legs over the side of 
the bed and sat there. She closed her eyes trying to relax and return 
her breathing back to normal, after a few moments it finally worked.

&#147;Why did it have to happen to me?&#148;

She didn&#146;t expect an answer; she looked over her shoulder and glanced 
down at her strangest new attribute. There, attached to the base of her 
spine where it met the pelvis was a long brown tail, matching the colour 
of her light auburn hair.

After the incident she and a few of her friends that decided she was 
still their friend and not a freak had done some reading, apparently it 
was some kind of spell that had caused her to transform. She slid onto 
the ground and walked over to her desk. It hadn&#146;t just made her switch 
gender but had also made her something more than human; it had made her 
a Wolf Demon.

It had made her stronger, faster and more agile, and after several 
attempts to try and commit suicide after the incident she had learned 
that she was also immortal. She had to admit that it wasn&#146;t what she 
looked like that had made her so upset, after all the female body that 
she was given was practically perfect.

Pert breasts that weren&#146;t large but not exactly small either, a slender 
figure with a cute tomboyish face along with rather short light brown 
hair, and long legs that ended in a perfect ass. She laughed slightly as 
she thought about it, as well as blushed.

&#147;The shyest guy on the planet gets given a hot girl&#146;s body, what&#146;re the 
odds in that&#148;

She sat down in her chair and looked at the book about demons that her 
friend Stuart had discovered about a month after the incident. It had 
several references towards Wolf Demons. She flipped through the pages 
until she found what she was looking for.

&#147;Wolf Demons: These creatures are a cross between Lycanthrope and 
Nosferatu, strong and powerful warriors they are among some of the 
greatest demonic fighters and consist entirely of females. Unlike 
Nosferatu they are noble creatures that always fight for the greater 
good or to better themselves.

Immortal they can live forever unless killed in combat but even that is 
extremely difficult as they can only die in certain ways, which as of 
yet are unknown.&#148;

She sighed and closed the book.

&#147;The whole transformation thing isn&#146;t that bad but&#133;&#148;

She closed her eyes tightly as she tried not to think of the reason she 
now hated her new existence.

&#147;MJ&#133;&#148;

She whispered the word so quietly that even in the silence of night it 
was as if it had never been spoken. It was the name of the girl he now 
she loved more than life itself, MJ, Madison Janelle Martin.

She knew that Madison was straight and now that they shared the same 
gender there was no chance of them ending up together. She laughed 
slightly. She had always said that Madison deserved better than him and 
now that he was a she Madison would end up with someone better than him.

But still&#133;

&#147;&#133;.I&#133;.love her&#148;

The tears were now stinging her eyes; it was all her own fault, as she 
kept telling herself.

&#147;If I hadn&#146;t been so damned curious&#133;.&#148;

She had to resist the urge to slam her fist onto her desk as she knew 
with her new strength she would have reduced the wooden structure to 
dust.

She breathed deeply and exhaled slowly, relaxing herself.

&#147;Well at least we can still be friends&#148;

She smiled weakly and stood up from her seat, moving back to her bed.

&#147;Which reminds me, I&#146;m supposed to be meeting her tomorrow she said she 
had something to tell me&#148;

Her smile grew slightly more content as she lay down on her bed and 
slowly drifted off to a dreamless sleep.

********** 

Stephanie awoke as the sun&#146;s light shone through the bedroom window and 
across her face; she blinked her eyes open and sat up dazedly with a 
rather goofy smile on her face.

&#147;I haven&#146;t slept like that in ages&#148;

She clasped her hands above her head and stretched with a smile before 
swinging her legs out of her bed and sliding to the floor.

&#147;Today&#146;s going to be a good day&#148;

She turned and looked at the clock. 09:27. She had gotten used to 
sleeping in to around about 11:00 every day since the incident but today 
she had to meet Madison at half past 10, which gave her one full hour to 
get ready.

More than enough time for someone lick herself who could get ready in a 
couple of seconds if need be.

As she grabbed her jeans and denim jacket her thoughts returned to what 
she was thinking about during the night and the sharp twinge of sorrow 
entered her heart. She closed her eyes and stood upright defiantly.

&#147;No. I refuse to think about that today. I&#146;m meeting MJ, therefore I 
must be happy&#148;

She nodded once and smiled as she ran to the bathroom, just enough time 
for a brief shower before she had to go. One good thing about being a 
wolf demon was that she had outstanding speed, yet another goofy grin 
grew on her face as she recalled out running Daly&#146;s motorbike on foot.

&#147;Hehehe, I&#146;m the fasting thing alive baby!&#148;

And with that she shed her night clothes (which were just a t-shirt and 
boxers) and turned on the shower, as she waited for the water&#146;s 
temperature to reach what she liked she turned and came face to face 
with her reflection in the rather large mirror.

A bright blush crossed her cheeks and she smiled shyly. She was always 
shy around girls and seeing one naked in the mirror ever time she went 
to the shower wasn&#146;t helping at all. After a few seconds the blush 
dissipated a little and she admired her body, all in all it was what she 
always considered her ideal woman to look like, apart from the tail.

&#147;Although&#133;I suppose&#133;it is kind&#146;a cute&#133;.and my hair aint frizzy like it 
was when I was a guy&#148;

She was staring to feel uneasy so she turned away from her reflection to 
check if the shower was at the right temperature, it was. She smiled 
contently as she stepped under the hot stream of water and let out a 
slight gasp of pleasure as it ran down her tail.

&#147;Why&#146;d it have to be so goddamn sensitive?&#148;

She tried her best to ignore the sensations that it was causing and just 
enjoy the shower like she used to. For most the temperature she liked 
would be far too hot but for her it was just the way she liked it, she 
closed her eyes as the water gently massaged her body making her relax.

&#147;Today&#146;s going to be a good day&#148;

********** 

Christina stood outside her friend&#146;s new residence, Stephanie had moved 
out of her parent&#146;s house so that those who still didn&#146;t like demons 
wouldn&#146;t focus on them. Tina was 5&#146; 11 and quite happy to reach that 
height, she had been working out ever since she came to Scotland last 
year and now had a rather trim and toned body that she was very proud 
of, her face was round and cute and her skin a chocolaty brown with two 
dark eyes that were deep and soulful and to Stephanie she wasn&#146;t just 
beautiful on the outside but also on the inside, ever since the event it 
had been Tina and Madison&#146;s support that had helped her the most. Not 
long after the incident had occurred did she see it on the news and 
instantly felt as though something extremely bad had happened. Sure she 
had only met Stephen over the net but they had become close friends over 
the time they had known each other and she just had to go and check it 
out.

Luckily Stephen wasn&#146;t the only one to be gifted with inhuman abilities 
as his friend Craig had been gifted with the ability to instantly 
teleport himself anywhere on the planet and take as many people as he 
wanted with him so she could go back to America for free whenever she 
wanted.

&#147;If only he could&#146;ve &#145;ported me here in the first place then I wouldn&#146;t 
have had to waste my money&#133;.&#148;

She paused as she felt a little guilty at that. Sure no one had been 
seriously hurt but she didn&#146;t know that at the time, being worried about 
a close friend wasn&#146;t a waste of money, and Scotland had turned out to 
be a nice place to stay and thanks to the money (and gold from their 
travels) she could afford a nice house all to herself, and Madison and 
Sami of course seeing as they all chipped in for it.

She looked back at her watch and let out a slight whine of boredom. It 
was 10:07. Stephanie should have been ready by now, so what was keeping 
her. Just then she heard the familiar greeting of: &#147;Hiya T-chan!!!&#148; And 
couldn&#146;t help but smile, for someone whose world had just been turned 
upside down he/she was still as cheerful as ever around friends.

&#147;Hiya Steph, what kept you?&#148;

She replied as she hugged the slightly shorter girl.

&#147;Its kind&#146;a embarrassin&#133;&#148;

Stephanie smiled shyly and looked down at the ground with her hands 
clasped behind her back. She then glanced to the side signalling Tina to 
look, and what she saw was so insanely cute that it almost made her 
laugh. Just below the tip of Stephanie&#146;s tail was slightly wrapped in 
bandages.

&#147;I slammed the door on my tail again&#148;

&#147;Awww, poor Stephie-chan&#148; she said affectionately.

&#147;Hey!&#148; yelled Stephanie in mock annoyance at the name. &#147;You know I don&#146;t 
like being called that&#148;

&#147;But its sooooo cute&#148;

The two laughed for a while before Tina finally remembered the time.

&#147;Owh yeah, you better hurry or you&#146;ll be late for your meeting with MJ. 
She wants to meet you in the park, do you need a ride&#148; she said, 
gesturing to her car.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry T; I&#146;ll be there in no time. I am the fasting thing alive 
after all&#148;

Stephanie hugged her friend once again and then took off running in the 
direction of the park at inhuman speed.

Tina sighed as she watched her friend run off and wondered if she 
enjoyed that hug a little too much. She shook her head.

&#147;Come on Tina you&#146;re not a lesbian&#133;&#148;

She walked over and opened the door to her car but paused and smiled.

&#147;Well maybe a little Bi&#148;

With that she burst out laughing and got into her car.

********** 

As Stephanie neared her desired place of destination she began to 
recognise the familiar scent of Madison. She could never describe all of 
the different scents for all of the different people, she just knew 
them. She could even tell people apart by their heartbeat which always 
came in fun for hide and seek with her younger cousins.

As the scent grew stronger she knew she was getting closer and the smile 
on her face widened. Dean and Stuart where away searching for ways to 
reverse the transformations, Tina was going to be at work all day to day 
(at least that&#146;s what she said) and everyone else was away visiting 
their parents. It would just be her and MJ today, and she blushed a 
little at the thought.

She ducked and weaved through the people and trees and leaped the small 
river instead of taking the bridge.

&#147;MJ!!!&#148; she yelled as she leaped and bounded towards the girl who had 
stolen her heart.

Madison was standing under a rather large tree with an affectionately 
annoyed expression on her pretty face.

&#147;Stephanie Janelle Lee, you&#146;re late&#148;

Stephanie skidded to a stop in front of her close friend and smiled like 
a little kid.

&#147;Awww but Ms Martin, I tried my best&#148;

&#147;Hehehe, awww aint you a cutie&#148;

The two laughed a little and then hugged. 

&#147;It&#146;s great to see you Steph&#148;

Stephanie then leaned back still hugging Madison slightly and raised an 
eyebrow.

&#147;Okay, what do you want?&#148;

Madison looked at her friend and smiled.

&#147;What do you mean my good Stephanie?&#148;

Stephanie took a step back and folded her arms across her chest adopting 
a more serious expression, before sating in a matter a factly voice.

&#147;You&#146;re only ever this nice to me when you want something&#148;

Madison smiled and then threw on a lock of mock hurt.

&#147;I don&#146;t believe you&#146;d you think such a thing&#148;

&#147;Yeah, so what d you want&#148;

Madison giggled slight before practically tackling the other girl in a 
hug.

&#147;Ohhhh, you&#146;ll find out later&#133;&#148;

Her expression grew serious and she looked into the other girls eyes.

&#147;I&#146;ve got something that I wanted to talk to you about&#148;

Stephanie began to feel a little nervous under her friend&#146;s suddenly 
intense disposition.

&#147;Okay&#133;.what is it?&#148;

&#147;Um&#133;could we find some place to sit down first&#133;&#148;

Madison&#146;s voice was shaky and that made Stephanie really nervous as her 
imagination started to run haywire.

 *What could possibly make her so nervous, especially around me? 
Maybe&#133;maybe she&#146;s got a boyfriend, man how would I survive that, or 
maybe she&#146;s going back to Canada, maybe she doesn&#146;t want to be friends 
with anymore cos she cant take me being a freak, maybe, maybe&#133;*

Soon a dull ache surfaced in her chest as she thought about it.

********** 

Tina was sitting by herself in Baxter&#146;s Tea-room, contemplating on what 
was going to happen. She couldn&#146;t deny the fact that she felt something 
for the younger girl, Stephanie. She had had a slight crush on the demon 
girl when she was still male but now that Stephen had become Stephanie 
she had finally realised that she still had feelings for her friend.

Just then someone tapped her on the shoulder and she nearly jumped out 
of her skin in surprise, she turned to see the smiling face of a short 
boy with short light brown hair and blue eyes. Dean Harkness, 
Stephanie&#146;s best friend and fellow demon. She swallowed hard knowing 
that Dean&#146;s demon powers gave him the ability to read other peoples 
minds and she didn&#146;t exactly want anyone to know about her feelings for 
Stephanie.

Dean was about 5&#146; 4, but it just added to the unreal cuteness that 
surrounded him, as did his now pointed elfin ears. He was slim built but 
everyone knew he had deceptive power under his small frame and a near 
constant smile which brightened the moods of most anyone.

&#147;Hiya Dean how&#146;s life&#148; she asked with a nervous smile on her face.

&#147;Oh I decided to come back early&#148; he said as he took a seat across from 
her.

&#147;I can see that&#148; Tina laughed as she calmed a bit, Dean had promised to 
not read peoples minds unless he absolutely had to and she saw no reason 
for him to use his powers on her. But now she was curious, why would he 
come back only one day after leaving. Something had to be up. &#147;So why&#146;d 
you come back so early, you find something&#148;

Dean smiled &#147;Unluckily no&#148; his face then adopted a more serious 
expression as he look Tina in the eyes. &#147;I can sense that something is 
going to happen&#148; he smiled slightly before continuing, &#147;There is a grave 
disturbance in the force&#148;

Tina laughed slightly at Dean&#146;s last comment but knew all to well what 
it usually meant when Dean had these feelings. &#147;So, you think it has 
something to do with Steph&#148;

&#147;It usually does, where is she&#148; he inquired, his smile now gone.

&#147;She&#146;s with Madison; MJ had something she wanted to talk to her about&#148;

Dean stood up and looked Tina in the eyes once more, she could see just 
how serious the young demon was as it was very visible in his eyes. 
&#147;Keep an eye open for anything strange, I&#146;m going to do a little 
searching&#148; he went to walk away but stopped, &#147;Steph&#146;s been through too 
much sorrow already, so don&#146;t tell her about this, I don&#146;t want to worry 
her&#148;

All Tina could do was nod as the once cheerful, now very serious Dean 
left. She looked down at her coffee and the worry finally caught up to 
her.

&#147;Stephen&#133;&#148;

********** 

Stephanie and Madison had found a nice quiet area to sit down; they now 
sat on top of a grassy hill under the shade of an old oak tree. The day 
was quite hot but a cool breeze was blowing and the smell of freshly cut 
flowers and nature allowed Stephanie to calm down a little. But she was 
till quite nervous, as Madison had yet to say anything or look her in 
the eye since they had made it to the hill.

Madison just sat there looking down the hill towards the town; 
Strathaven was such a peaceful place and from what Stephanie had heard, 
Madison liked it.

Stephanie turned to her friend, looking at her from the side. To Steph, 
she was perfection, from her smooth slightly tanned skin, to her short 
silky blonde hair and beautiful body, her face was that of an angel and 
Stephanie just loved everything about her. Truth be told Stephanie 
preferred brunettes, but Madison was an exception, besides it wasn&#146;t her 
natural colour. But what Steph loved most about Madison, was her eyes. 
Those twin crystal pools of blue and tints of green that Stephanie had 
lost herself in so many times.

&#147;Beautiful&#133;&#148; she whispered quietly and then quickly covered her mouth, 
hoping that Madison hadn&#146;t heard her. By the look of things, she hadn&#146;t, 
or at least wasn&#146;t showing that she had as she just continued to watch 
the quiet town.

The two just sat there, Madison never looking away from the town and 
Stephanie never taking her eyes from the beautiful girl that had 
captured her heart. Two hours past, and soon Stephanie had forgotten 
about her earlier nervousness all together as she just sat there and 
watched her friend.

Just then Madison turned to Stephanie and smiled causing the older of 
the two to blush.

&#147;So, um, what was it you wanted to talk to me about&#148; asked Steph, 
suddenly nervous again.

Madison&#146;s smile weakened slightly but her lips were still curved 
slightly upwards and soon sparkling blue met with deep hazel and 
Stephanie&#146;s blush intensified.

&#147;Well Steph&#133;&#148; she turned back to the town &#147;first, I&#146;d like to ask you a 
question&#148;

&#147;Um, sure, fire away&#148; said the demon girl trying her best not to sound 
as nervous as she felt and not doing an awfully good job at it.

Madison smiled a little more but still didn&#146;t turn back to Stephanie as 
she asked &#147;How do you feel about me?&#148;

Stephanie was taken aback by the question but before she could say 
anything Madison continued on although she didn&#146;t turn to look at 
Stephanie.

&#147;And I want you to answer truthfully I want you to say what&#146;s if your 
heart&#148; she turned to look Stephanie in the eyes, and the demon girl 
could see something in them, something that she hadn&#146;t seen before, 
something that was slowly giving her strength &#147;please&#148;.

Stephanie thought carefully about what she could say. She had to tell 
Madison what was in her heart but, *no, not buts. I&#146;ve got to tell her, 
she deserves to know how I still feel about her, how I will always feel 
about her* so she closed her eyes and spoke her heart.

&#147;Madison, I think that you are the most beautiful thing on this planet, 
from your eyes to your personality, you&#146;re perfection to me. I love 
everything about you with ever fibre of my being, it&#146;s the way I&#146;ve 
always felt and always will feel, every second I&#146;m away from you I feel 
like my soul is being torn apart and every second I&#146;m around you I&#146;m so 
happy that I could just cry&#133;quite frankly I love you more than anything 
else in existence and would gladly do anything for you&#133;but I know now 
that I&#146;m this that we cant be together and I&#146;m fine with that, it does 
eat me up that we cant be together romantically but I&#146;m as happy as can 
be that we can be friends&#148;

She slowly opened her eyes, and what she saw tugged at her heart strings 
enough to confuse how she should have felt at that moment. Madison was 
crying. But she was also smiling.

&#147;Stephen&#133;&#148;

She leaned in and hugged her confused friend, closing her eyes to try 
and hold back the tears that were fighting their way out and resting her 
head on Stephanie&#146;s shoulder. After a moment, Stephanie&#146;s confusion 
vanished and she slowly began to hug Madison back, closing her eyes to 
enjoy the feeling of her being so close even more.

&#147;Stephanie&#133;I love you&#148;

It took a few moments for the words to sink in, and Stephanie opened her 
eyes and looked at the crying girl in her arms. &#147;But, why&#133;we&#146;re both 
girls now and&#133;&#148; Madison cut her off.

&#147;Because&#133;I fell in love with you before I ever saw you, and have loved 
you ever since. It never mattered to me what you looked like because I 
had already fallen for what was on the inside, then when I finally saw 
the handsome man that was you I just fell for you more and now&#133;now that 
handsome man&#146;s gone, but he&#146;s been replaced by a beautiful woman, and no 
matter what gender you are now, you&#146;re still the Stephen Lee that I fell 
in love with, you&#146;re still the same person that I met all that time ago 
on Sunni&#146;s site&#133;.and I&#146;m always going to love you, no matter what you 
are cos you&#146;re always going to be Stephen to me&#148;

&#147;Madison&#133;&#148; was all that Stephanie could let out before the tears took 
over and she closed her eyes as she hugged Madison tighter, she was 
happier than she had ever been and it had all been caused by one person, 
and that was one person she wasn&#146;t going to let go of.

Madison then leaned back and looked up to Stephanie&#146;s face, wiping away 
her friend&#146;s tears with her thumb, she then smiled and Stephanie smiled 
back.

&#147;I love you Steph&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve always loved you MJ&#148;

They then just sat there, staring into each others eyes and basking in 
the affection that they saw reflected in each other. One a demon the 
other a human, but neither cared, they were in love and that is what 
mattered.
