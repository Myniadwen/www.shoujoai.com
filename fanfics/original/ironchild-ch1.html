<h1>Tokyo Iron Child Akari (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Kaiser&#39;s Foreword
-----------------
Hey there! Kaiser here. I&#39;ve been absent from the game a while, but this 
&#39;little&#39; fic right here should make up for it. I&#39;ll come out and say 
this fiction is heavily inspired by Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, 
Gasaraki, and to a lesser extent, Gundam Wing. As you can imagine it&#39;s a 
mecha/sci-fi fiction, which is something I don&#39;t do very often. But I 
really enjoyed writing this, and in the end it turned out to be the 
longest original I have ever written (60,000+ words, longer than Rival 
Rage 1). This fic is pretty detailed and lengthy compaired to my other 
workings so if you plan on reading through it all at once, I suggest you 
go grab a coffee first ^_^.

Here are some notes that you may want to know before we get started.

CMB Data: Cardio-Muscular-Brainwave Data
AG: Asuka Group
BP Levels: Blood Pressure Levels
ST Link: Space Time Link
AGIST: Asuka Group Industrial Skyscraper Tower
SU: System unit
CFL: Cybernetic Feedback Link

Anyways, sit, enjoy, and if you have any comments, mail me.

When I look out into the sky, 
What do I see?
Clouds and storms, birds and bees,
What does it all mean to me?

When I look into myself,
What do I see?
Heartbreak and agony, jealousy and monotony, 
What does it all mean to me?
How real could it be?

It&#39;s a steel heart and an iron soul, 
It&#39;s just a thing that I&#39;ve been told,
I don&#39;t think, I don&#39;t see, 
I&#39;m just a puppet with no sense of reality, 

It&#39;s a steel heart and an iron soul, 
A dead life in a world gone cold,
I don&#39;t think, I don&#39;t see, 
If I could feel it I&#39;d call it misery!
So when I look at the sky and say I&#39;m on a roll, 
Just remember my iron soul!

STAGE 1: Tokyo Blossom 

**********

&quot;Oh dammit! My power cell is losing energy! You got a take on this, 
Ryoko?&quot;

&quot;Calm down! I gave the power cell a recharge this morning, but it is 
still damaged, like I told you! Just find the parts room and get the 
fresh one! If everything goes to plan, you won&#39;t need your weapons so 
don&#39;t worry about losing a little energy.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom sighed miserably. Her Mobile Shell seemed to be giving 
more trouble than it was worth these days. This had to be the second 
time in the current month that she had snuck into one of the Asuka 
Group&#39;s warehouses to steal a spare part or appliance that Ryoko 
couldn&#39;t get a hold of. Maintaining this thing was a mission in itself. 
Without moving her legs, Tokyo Blossom nodded forwards and looked around 
the wall she was hiding behind. There were no security guards or 
policing Marionette shells for her to worry about. At least she didn&#39;t 
have to worry about what her power cell might do if she had to fight 
someone off. 

Tokyo Blossom peered to stare at the other side, through the dark blue 
glass of her head visor. No guards in that route either. But just before 
she proceeded to run through the passageway to the parts room, she 
looked upwards at the white painted ceiling. There were security cameras 
every ten metres, either side of the corridor. 

Thank god Ryoko had the floor plans for the warehouse. Tokyo Blossom 
pressed the small button under the long slanted ear of her cyber helmet, 
with the metallic fingers of her cyber gauntlet. Luckily this shell had 
a radio frequency link, allowing her to make contact with Ryoko even 
with miles of distance between them. 

&quot;Ryoko!&quot; Tokyo Blossom began. &quot;There&#39;s a security camera unit here! What 
should I do? Should I blow &#39;um up or what?&quot;

&quot;Hold it. Just calm yourself and think for a second. If you do that 
you&#39;ll alert the Asuka Group&#39;s security team of your presence.&quot;

&quot;Well duh!&quot; Tokyo Blossom said blankly. &quot;So what the heck should I do? 
Get my ass caught or risk running by, miss smarty-ass!?&quot;

&quot;... I&#39;m going to ignore that, for your sake. Now settle down and think 
about what you are doing. Are there any wires or cables close to the 
cameras?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom observed the hallway&#39;s security cameras. Of each camera 
there were three wires connecting them to the wall, and the same applied 
for the ones doing down in the opposite direction. 

&quot;There&#39;s three wires for each of the cameras, one green, one brown and 
the other red. What should I do? Should I disconnect each camera by 
cutting the wires?&quot;

&quot;Now you&#39;re using your brain.&quot; Ryoko said jokingly. &quot;Disconnect the red 
and green cables by going into combat mode and using your palm blasters. 
That will cut the connection without triggering the alarm. But rest 
assured that there will be someone going down there to check out the 
problem, so you must be as quick as you can be while securing the power 
cell.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha.&quot; 

Tokyo Blossom cut the COM link between herself and Ryoko, and geared up 
for action. Mumbling the words &#39;combat mode initiate&#39; the Mobile Shell 
entered its battle frame. The gauntlets at her wrists extended and 
linked with the surrounding armour of the arms, the visor over her eyes 
sloping down to obscure her mouth from view. Each circuit of her armour 
was now working at its peak efficiency, the perfect set-up for battling 
anything that the Asuka Group could send at her. Tokyo Blossom extended 
her wrist, aiming it upwards, so that it aligned with the camera closest 
to her. Within the metal of her gauntlets palm, nestled in the centre, 
was a small red orb that harnessed the power of her battery cell. With 
the virtual crosshairs being emitted by her visor, Tokyo Blossom aimed 
her palm at the camera and growled femininely as she fired. The orb shot 
out a blast of red-hot energy, powerful and precise enough to cut 
through the wire without alerting the security via the alarm system. 

Tokyo Blossom repeated that process over and over again, until every 
camera had been disabled, then gripped her fist and lowered her arm in 
success. &quot;Oh yeah! That&#39;s the aim of the Tokyo Blossom, baby! Now I 
better get that power cell before Ryoko start complaining again...&quot;

The Tokyo Blossom ran down the freshly safe corridor, unworried by the 
security system. Like Ryoko had said, the warehouse had quite a few 
passages, so Tokyo Blossom had to dodge and dart through all of them, as 
stealthy and as quiet as she could do. After at least ten minutes of 
searching, Tokyo Blossom exited the warehouse corridors and entered the 
warehouse&#39;s storage area. The year may have been 2057, but the odd 
Japanese warehouse didn&#39;t look any different than it had done sixty 
years ago. At least from what TB had learned from classic information 
discs. Dozens of crates were stacked on top of each other, the floors 
were cracked and dusty, and filthy, un-cleaned windows at the top of the 
room barely allowed moonlight to peer through from the night sky. Tokyo 
Blossom eyed the whole room as best she could. Unlike the corridors, 
there were sentries posted at certain locations around the large hall, 
the most prominent being the three positioned around a halo-beam 
surrounding some of the Asuka Group&#39;s three-year power cells. 

In a flash, Tokyo Blossom resumed contact with Ryoko. &quot;Ryoko!&quot; She 
whispered. &quot;I made it to the holding chamber, but I think these Asuka 
bastards have beefed up their security since last time.&quot;

&quot;What are you up against? What are they and how many of them are there?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom scanned the room again. &quot;I&#39;d say there is about fifteen of 
the suckers. They&#39;re all level three combat Marionette Shells. A couple 
of them are armed with laser hand cannons.&quot;  

&quot;Is there anyway you can get to one of the power cells without revealing 
yourself?&quot; Ryoko asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so...&quot;

&quot;Then you are going to have to fight them. I know it&#39;s risky, because 
your power cell was so damaged in the last fight but you have to do 
this. How much energy do you think you have left?&quot;
Tokyo Blossom observed the data readings on her visor. &quot;The suit says it 
has about 3% of its energy left.&quot;

&quot;Damn!&quot; Ryoko cursed. &quot;Even though I recharged your current power cell, 
its energy level still dropped by 22%. This is bad, but it gives you 
about fifty minutes of full activity left. You have to destroy as many 
marionettes as you can, then get out of there with the new power cell.&quot;

Tokyo B prepared herself. &quot;Is there anyway I can reduce the amount of 
energy I use in the fight?&quot;

&quot;Try dropping the suit&#39;s BP levels to 37%, and turn off AG coolant 
system. It may get a little cold in that thing, but it&#39;s better than 
dying.&quot; 
 
&quot;Right.&quot; Tokyo Blossom made the necessary adjustments to her Mobile 
Shell, just as Ryoko asked. She pulled up her wrist, and the rectangular 
indent of it opened up to reveal a small video-screen and miniature 
keypad. Tokyo B tapped in a certain code, and then closed down the 
mini-computer, locking it back in her gauntlet. The moment she made the 
changes, she began to feel the effect on her body. The suit was a part 
of her, ever since she made the ST-link with it. But there was no time 
to think about that choice in her life. 

Tokyo Blossom looked over through the room once more. The part she 
needed, the power cell, was just a short distance away, only twenty 
metres. If she made a dash for it, grabbed the thing, and then just blew 
the hell out of there, then the plan might work. The only problem was 
the marionette units that were covering the room. Those things may not 
have been equipped with Army-standard SU&#39;s, but they weren&#39;t short on 
simple sensory sight. They would detect her in no time at all. 

&quot;If only I had a diversion.&quot; Tokyo B mused quietly. &quot;If only something 
could... wait a minute...&quot;

Though her visor masked it, there was a smile underneath Tokyo B&#39;s 
headgear. The woman gave a brief chuckle as a brilliant plan came to her 
mind. Bringing her arm up again, the Mobile Shell wearer aimed her palm 
blasters at the sprinkler system on the ceiling of the warehouse. Level 
3&#39;s were not waterproof!

In one second, Tokyo B shot at the twist cap along the pipes of upper 
sprinkler system. Though the marionettes turned to stare at the point of 
which the blast was fired, they could do nothing about it. Water poured 
free from the ceiling as Tokyo Blossom triggered the sprinkler system, 
some of that classic H2O running free on the unsuspecting robotic 
sentries below. The metal soldiers, shaped as Mobile Shells, released 
one after another of their robotic screams, collapsing as the water 
shorted out their systems. Tokyo B grinned triumphantly. 

&quot;Take that you jerks!&quot; Tokyo Blossom yelled. 

Now free to act with the belief that she was in the clear, Tokyo Blossom 
ran out in warehouse storage area. Her Mobile Shell was made of a 
metallic alloy that was virtually waterproof. Japanese miners had dug 
under into a reserve of the metal in the town of Kuji, shortly after the 
2069 quake. After learning its incredible properties, scientists named 
this substance &#39;kowarenai&#39; or for short, Kowa-steel. However, Tokyo B&#39;s 
plan didn&#39;t quite work out that way.

&quot;What the hell?!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom dove to the side to avoid the energy blasts that fired at 
her from the front, the sound of compressed energy ringing in her ears. 
She looked up and in front, and saw that two of the marionette shells 
were still active. Even though their armour was being blasted under the 
downpour of the sprinkler systems.

&quot;That can&#39;t be!&quot; Tokyo Blossom said. &quot;Those two aren&#39;t standard 
marionettes... if they can resist water like that... but they look 
exactly like the rest... so how is it possible?&quot;

Tokyo B didn&#39;t wait long to debate the issue, not that she had the 
opportunity. The wearer of the Mobile Shell ran to her left with all the 
swiftness her suit could muster, dodging the next chain of blasts that 
the marionettes were firing at her. They were right in front of the 
power cell that Tokyo B needed, there was absolutely no way she could 
avoid fighting them. Tokyo Blossom leapt up into the air, the feet of 
her armour were still as agile and as powerful as ever, and effortlessly 
propelled her upwards. Tokyo B screamed fiercely as she descended toward 
the marionette units from above, reaching her hand behind her back to 
draw... 

&quot;Oh crap!&quot; Tokyo Blossom sweat dropped. &quot;I forgot that I left my sword 
at Ryoko&#39;s place for her to repair too! Oh man, who came up with this 
half-assed plan, anyway?!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom veered away from the marionette she was landing near, and 
cart wheeled to her right side, avoiding the third chain of energy 
blasts freed from the laser guns. She continued to roll out of the way 
of the blasts, dodging and diving until she rolled behind a 
steel-sorting machine. 

&quot;Ryoko!&quot; Tokyo B demanded. &quot;You better have my sword ready when I get 
back! Your plan sucks!&quot;

&quot;If you don&#39;t want the White Orchid Mobile Shell to get so damaged then 
you should be more careful when you use it. Now stop complaining and 
just concentrate on the task at hand. You still have the palm blasters 
and your suit has lost none of its super-strength.&quot;

Tokyo B peered her head around the machine. The two marionette units 
were closing in. &quot;I wish I could just blow them all away with a Hyper 
Blast, but I guess the armour doesn&#39;t have enough energy for that, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Correct.&quot; Ryoko confirmed. &quot;Just do what you can and get that power 
cell.&quot; 

&quot;Geez! I am so gonna kick your ass when I get back, Ryoko!&quot; Tokyo B 
snapped playfully. She then looked back at the advancing marionette 
unit. There had to be a way of fighting them without using the weapons 
of her armour. Then her eyes picked up on what the marionettes were 
holding.

&quot;Those blasters!&quot; Tokyo B thought. &quot;I bet I could use those against the 
enemy!&quot;

With a new plan in mind, Tokyo Blossom dove away from the sorting 
machine she was hiding behind, narrowly dodging the laser fire from the 
attacking marionette units. One of those blasters could finish off the 
enemy in no time, Tokyo Blossom was sure of it. The armour-donning 
warrior ran past all the blasts that were being fired at her, growling 
in irritation as their fire chased her around the room. 

&quot;Man, for a bunch of brainless robots, they sure have a lot of spunk!&quot;

But there was no more need to run. Tokyo Blossom sighed with relief as 
she reached one of the marionette units that had been disabled by the 
sprinkler water, which was still coming down around her. The girl 
kneeled down and ripped one of the blasters free from the grip of the 
downed marionette unit, and placed her own grip on it with both of her 
metal-covered hands. One of the fingers of said hand squeezed at the 
trigger, and fired wave after wave of laser shots at the marionette 
units that were chasing after her. Both went down, laser fire piercing 
their metal body plates and destroying the sensitive wires and circuits 
inside. 

&quot;Well...&quot; Tokyo B began, dropping the gun. &quot;That was a blast. Now I 
better get the power cell and get the hell outta here.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom dashed back over to the power cell, noticing that the 
speed of her running was decreasing by the minute. The power cell was 
stacked on a stone podium, while an energy ring passed up and down the 
podium at breakneck speed. It was a modern style of item protection, but 
still had one fatal flaw... 

Tokyo B kicked the cable that plugged it into the wall. &quot;These things 
are still new after all.&quot;

With a grin of triumph under her visor, Tokyo B grabbed the small power 
cell in hand and ran back the way she came, through the passages that 
led down into the sewers of Shinjuku. But, though she had not noticed, a 
figure was watching her from the shadows. A figure that was clad in a 
Mobile Shell.

&quot;Very interesting.&quot; He said. &quot;The White Orchid suit is still active... 
and obviously has a new pilot. But if that pilot thinks that they can 
steal from and defy the Asuka Group, they have another thing coming. I 
will see you again...&quot; The dark figure gripped the spear at his side 
even tighter. &quot;... Be sure of it...&quot;

**********

&quot;Man... what a roller coaster of a week...&quot;

Akari collapsed onto her violet-coloured bed with a thump. Though she 
had just woken up about three hours ago, she still felt tired. Her 
muscles felt sore, her eyes felt even heavier, and she could barely move 
a muscle without one big old bout of effort. Not that Akari was 
overstressing herself or anything, it just seemed like her body wasn&#39;t 
quite cut out for all the work she had been doing. For her &#39;legitimate&#39; 
work, it was even worse. Serving fast food customers while half-asleep 
wasn&#39;t doing her any favours. That wasn&#39;t to say that Akari hated her 
job or anything, well... actually she did, but hey, it paid well, and 
that&#39;s the *real* reason most people like their jobs, right?

For Akari, such a job had to pay well. The indignation of having to work 
at a fast food place was beyond belief. Stinking of grease and being a 
&#39;happy helper of Tokyo Burger&#39;s well oiled machine&#39; was not the kind of 
job that she was willing to deal with. Least of all right now. But fast 
food joints had been springing up faster than cherry blossom trees in 
autumn, ever since the 1990&#39;s. That boom seemed to be at its xenon right 
now, especially in places like Roppongi, a district that attracted a lot 
of foreign attention. It was probably like experiencing a slice of home 
for them, and Akari could understand that much. Due to the growing 
popularity of these fast food franchises, people were jumping like jack 
rabbits to hop on the bandwagon. Akari was one of those people fortunate 
enough to get a job with the biggest fast food joint in town, Tokyo 
Burger. 

Akari sighed, running a hand through her shoulder-long locks of snow 
white hair. She remembered that today was Friday. She&#39;d have to go in a 
little later for a midday shift. Another day of serving greasy food and 
drink to masses of hopeless gaijin and gaijin-wannabes. If it weren&#39;t 
for the fact that the girls over at Tokyo Burger were so cute, Akari 
would have dropped the job months ago.

Just at that moment, the light and beeping siren of Akari&#39;s doorbell 
system went off.  &quot;Someone&#39;s here? At this hour? Geez man. It&#39;s only 
5.30 in the morning.&quot;

Akari pushed herself off the bed with both arms and strode over the 
intercom box hanging beside her bedroom door. Every room in her 
apartment was fitted with one, just so that she knew who was at her door 
at all times. And although she was dressed only in a very large 
sweatshirt that barely ran passed her thighs, Akari didn&#39;t mind 
answering the door. If there was one thing Akari Minako was proud of, it 
was her body. 

The white-haired girl pressed the button of her intercom box, speaking 
towards it. &quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Akari? It&#39;s me, Ryoko.&quot;

&quot;I should have known.&quot; Akari said. &quot;Come on up, Ryoko.&quot;

Akari stepped away from the intercom box, after switching the button 
that allowed Ryoko entry into her apartment. As she walked back to the 
bed, her bare feet narrowly stalked through the piles of panties, used 
wrappers and CD cases. Her place was a mess, in great fashion, but Akari 
had done nothing about it. She was not much of that 1950&#39;s &#39;home-keeper&#39; 
type of Japanese woman. The year was 2057, and a messy apartment was 
considered fashionable to a certain extent. Of course, Akari&#39;s place 
went right past that extent and didn&#39;t look back. Not that she cared 
much, she was just comfortable living the way she was, even though Ryoko 
may have regarded her as a &#39;slob&#39; for it. 

Speaking of Ryoko, the 23-year-old worker just happened to walk in 
through Akari&#39;s bedroom door, at the same time that Akari fell back onto 
her bed. 

&quot;Akari?&quot; Ryoko said questioningly. 

Akari just nuzzled her head into her pillow, not even bothering to look 
at her friend. &quot;I&#39;m tired, Ryoko. Do you know what time it is? It&#39;s half 
past five in the morning. It was just seven hours ago that you sent me 
on that screwed up mission, to grab that power cell. So if I&#39;m a little 
sleepy, then you can understand why, right?&quot;

&quot;Is this all getting too much for you?&quot; Ryoko asked.

&quot;All what?&quot;

&quot;Working a daytime job and being Tokyo Blossom at the same time?&quot;

Akari sighed once more. &quot;I don&#39;t have much of a choice, do I? The 
ST-Link is on me right now. Unless I die, no one else can pilot the 
White Orchid like I can. Besides... I have to stop those Asuka Group 
bastards if it&#39;s the last thing I do.&quot;

Ryoko crossed her arms. &quot;Which is why I put you to such lengths to get a 
new power cell. The White Orchid Mobile Shell can&#39;t run without power, 
Akari. Now that we have a new power cell, we don&#39;t have to worry about 
missions like that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, until the next time you need a rare spark plug for my robot&#39;s 
chasse.&quot;

&quot;Stop complaining.&quot; Ryoko said. &quot;Everything turned out fine didn&#39;t it? 
You are alive, we have the new power cell, and I&#39;m already starting work 
on the Mobile Shell for you. Your weapons should be restored soon, 
including your sword.&quot;

Akari softened her hostility a bit. This was just as hard on Ryoko as it 
was on her. And to be fair, Akari couldn&#39;t do this without Ryoko. Ryoko 
Zabuya was a member of the Asuka Group, working in one of their many 
accounting departments at the AG&#39;s main building. But at night, she was 
the one mechanic that could tangle with a system as complex and as 
demanding as the White Orchid. And considering the fact that there were 
only six Mobile Shells in the world, including the White Orchid, Ryoko 
was doing a pretty good job. The younger girl pulled herself up into a 
sitting position and smiled sweetly at the older Ryoko.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ryoko.&quot; Akari said in earnest. &quot;I guess we really are acting 
like a pair of ex-girlfriends, huh? You&#39;re always nagging at me, I&#39;m 
always driving you crazy, guess you and I are up there with the best of 
&#39;um.&quot;

Ryoko blushed for thinking of that. She and Akari were best friends now, 
but it had been much more than that last year. Ryoko recalled leaving a 
class late and going to Tokyo Burger for a quick meal before heading 
home. While queuing up behind the other consumers, she noticed that one 
of the waitresses kept staring at her from behind. While she kept her 
calm, Ryoko had to admit the flattery she felt. Then after buying what 
she wanted, Ryoko was about to leave, until she bumped into a student 
who spilled a milkshake all over her. Naturally Ryoko was about as 
embarrassed as you can imagine, but the flirtatious waitress took her 
around to the back and helped her get cleaned up. While they were doing 
that, the two of them got talking and that was how they met each other. 
Though things had moved fast, later on that night, even before that 
trademark cup of coffee, Ryoko slept with Akari. It was the beginning of 
a healthy relationship though, for the both of them. But, like all 
relationships, it didn&#39;t last, and Ryoko and Akari split up in December. 
They had agreed to stay friends, which was successful, and their battles 
with the Asuka Group had never been effected either. Still, there was a 
little tension there. They asked each other&#39;s permission before seeing 
someone else, and Ryoko could not mistake the slight jealousy she felt 
from seeing Akari with other women. Even now, when Akari&#39;s 19th birthday 
was coming up, Ryoko was still debating about what kind of present she 
was going to get for the girl. She didn&#39;t want it to seem like she still 
had... feelings for Akari, even if she did, which was making her wary of 
just what kind of message she might send out if she gave Akari something 
expensive. 

But hey, that was the friendship of Akari and Ryoko, halfway between 
lovers and friends, abrupt lust and simple liking. Through all of their 
battles with the evil of the Asuka Group, that crazy ride of a 
connection they had was not weakening, and was showing no future signs 
of it either, no matter how much they argued with each other. 

&quot;For sure, Akari.&quot; Ryoko said. &quot;That&#39;s just the way we are with each 
other I suppose. Now, yesterday when you came back to my place, you said 
something about an irregularity in the marionette units that you faced?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... it was weird. I turned on the sprinkler system of the warehouse 
to disable them, and most of the suckers went down, but the two guarding 
the power cell weren&#39;t fazed. They looked *exactly* like standard level 
three combat models, but their armour was waterproof.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Ryoko said in disbelief.

Akari just nodded. &quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...&quot; Mused Ryoko, holding a hand to her chin. &quot;It looks like the 
Asuka Group is cracking on to us. Up until now, we&#39;ve kept your Mobile 
Shell from the government as well as the public, but I guess that 
slip-up in Shibuya really killed your cover.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re kidding, right? It blew my cover right out the window. I even 
saw a picture of myself in the Mobile Shell in last week&#39;s Tokyo News 
CD. Everyone knows about Tokyo Blossom now. I&#39;m becoming a cult legend. 
So the Asuka Group will be doing all they can to track me down... but I 
won&#39;t let them stop me. Not after what they did...&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t give up. Not until we make the world see just what the Asuka 
Group is like. But it&#39;s going to be so hard. They already have a 
foothold in parliament. What&#39;s more, they supply this city with so much 
electrical goods that they could bring us to a standstill if they 
stopped providing it. Tokyo relies so much on machinery these days... 
companies like the Asuka Group will have no problems in manipulating 
that weakness for their own gain.&quot;

Akari narrowed her eyes. &quot;That won&#39;t ever happen. Not as long as I have 
my Mobile Shell.&quot;

**********

Shigure bowed down from the waist downwards, tilting his head as low as 
it would possibly go in order to present his respect. And as he looked 
upon his leader with dark, calculating eyes, he found himself in awe 
once more. No matter how many times his marble orbs glanced at Queen 
Sagi, Shigure could never replace that insanely large feeling of wonder, 
of enchantment. That thrilling notion of watching the future of humanity 
so neatly rolled into one woman. 

Even in this room, the largest and highest room in the entire complex of 
the Asuka Group Industrial Skyscraper Tower (The AGIST), Queen Sagi 
seemed like something out of an ancient prophecy, an unholy-angel 
descending from the clouds of heaven and ascending from the flames of 
hell. The formally dressed man looked across the room at his empress, 
standing poised in the middle of the darkly decorated room. Queen Sagi 
stood with blank emerald eyes, her arms hanging loosely at her sides. 
Her body wrapped with nothing the molecules of air surrounding her, 
completely naked, though her demeanour possessed no shame, embarrassment 
or fear. Her dark black hair, so extensive and so elongated, spilled off 
her shoulders and down into the ground, which then trailed along the 
floor in different streaks, reaching the far wall. Those thick tresses 
were attached to sockets and openings in the walls, each of those gave 
Queen Sagi connections to the computer terminals in the building, her 
mind was in link with the entire computer system of the building. 

Shigure still could only blink. Queen Sagi was such a sight to behold. 
Her physical development ended as she reached the age of 18, so her body 
was so youthful and innocent. But her mind and voice possessed the 
maturity of an adult female, the knowledge and power flowing through her 
mind and cells were merely a crown on this queen&#39;s head. The combination 
of a young woman&#39;s beauty and a commanding adult&#39;s mind made Queen Sagi 
something... beyond purity. Beyond any notion such as final or ultimate, 
perfect and flawless. That was Queen Sagi, leader and unchallenged ruler 
of the Asuka Group. 

Before long, Queen Sagi&#39;s blank eyes became bright with passion and 
intensity, gazing at her subordinate with a powerful superiority.  

&quot;Shigure...&quot; Her beautiful voice spoke. &quot;What have you to report to me?&quot;

Shigure rose to his feet. &quot;My queen, I bring you news of the Mobile 
Shell that was lost those three years ago. The Mobile Shell known as the 
White Orchid.&quot;

&quot;Speak on.&quot;

&quot;Yes, my queen.&quot; Shigure continued. &quot;The White Orchid was spotted 
attacking one of our warehouses in Shibuya. As you know, we have had 
many attacks on warehouses by rogues to our authority, but we have now 
determined that the current wielder of White Orchid brought this along. 
Whoever has been using it now is aware that only the Asuka Group has 
created the necessary parts and chips that the Mobile Shells run on, not 
least of which, the power cells that the operating systems need to 
function at peak efficiency.  We cannot allow this rogue to attack us in 
such a way anymore. For if information about MS unit reached the wrong 
hands...&quot;

&quot;The mass media are already aware of the existence of the White Orchid.&quot; 
Queen Sagi chided. &quot;Though they know nothing of its true origin. They 
know not that the Asuka Group manufactured them... the MS units were my 
father&#39;s dream... we possess five... the final one must be secured. It 
will be a detriment to our efforts if it is not.&quot;

&quot;I know this, my queen. Which is way I have devised a plan to lure out 
the possessor of the White Orchid. Once we find out the identity of the 
pilot, I shall kill them, thereby breaking the ST-Link and making the 
White Orchid Mobile Shell free to use.&quot;

Queen Sagi glared at Shigure. &quot;As pilot of the Omega Mobile Shell, you 
have the power to do that, Shigure Kagami. But do not underestimate your 
opponent. The White Orchid is... a formidable tool for destruction. You 
must do all in your power to reclaim the White Orchid before the 
government discovers the Asuka Group&#39;s involvement in its creation.&quot;

&quot;I understand.&quot; Shigure replied. 

It was then that Queen Sagi crossed over into more important matters, 
ones that she was a little more concerned about. &quot;Now... I must ask 
you... how has the Origin Scheme gone to plan? I have not the power to 
foresee its fruition.&quot;

&quot;It is underway. Test Sample 000...&quot; Shigure shuffled slightly when he 
saw that magnificent look of irritation in Sagi&#39;s eyes. &quot;I mean... 
Kagome, is ready for transportation to the AGIST. She is not... quite 
ready for contact with Neganas, but in due time...&quot;

&quot;Make sure she is ready soon.&quot; Queen Sagi shut her eyes for a second, 
then merged her mind with one of the video cameras perched on the AGIST 
rooftop, observing the bright night sky that was about to fall into the 
morning sun. &quot;The hour is fast approaching. When the stars are in 
alignment, and the sky turns bright with glee... that is when I shall 
rear my children... to rear humanity&#39;s destiny...&quot;

&quot;I look forward to that time too, my Queen.&quot; Shigure said. 

Queen Sagi stretched a smile. &quot;I know. You have been so loyal to me, 
Shigure Kagami. That is why I wish you to be careful on the battlefield. 
Please adorn your efforts with as many of attack corps as you please.&quot;

&quot;The Attack Corps?&quot; Shigure gasped. &quot;But those units are only used for 
special missions and oversees affairs. Even now, the second division is 
in the Middle East, refining oil suppositories from outlanders on the 
border. Besides, where will we stage the fight in secrecy? Land Golem 
mechs and Earth Crabs are armaments that were created by the Asuka Group 
for ground level military use... I fear the Japanese Regular Army may 
learn the nature of the Attack Corps&#39;s origin.&quot;

&quot;Do you not think I know that?&quot; Queen Sagi asked rhetorically. &quot;I can 
read your mind... your soul, Shigure Kagami. You cannot stage the battle 
in this city. The media would detect any damage or fallout with speed 
the likes of which you have never seen. Take the fight outside of Tokyo, 
use three of the Attack Corps&#39;s Land Golems, and decide on how many 
marionette units will be used. You must capture the White Orchid before 
it causes any more annoyances for the Asuka Group. I am counting you, my 
knight.&quot;

Shigure nodded with a small smile, walking backwards towards the door of 
the room. &quot;I will do all that is in my power to serve and defend you, 
Queen Sagi.&quot;
 
Within a few seconds, Shigure was gone. The automatic doors slid closed 
as he exited the room, leaving behind only Queen Sagi, the great leader 
of the Asuka Group. Sagi&#39;s smile left her face as Shigure left the hall. 
That fallen smile was replaced by a frown, and Queen Sagi&#39;s bright 
emerald eyes looked downwards, her heart suddenly heavy. Images of a 
person, a woman appeared in the back of her vast mind, a picture of a 
young girl, bright and cheerful, dancing in the wind, on a grassy plain.

An image of Asuka, her Asuka. 

&quot;Asuka...&quot; Queen Sagi said gently, her voice slow and drawn. &quot;If only 
you would have stayed loyal to me, my love... I would not have to 
eliminate your daughter... she would have been our daughter...  and you 
would still be here... with me.&quot;

***********

&quot;Cruising down to Osaka! Passing time away! She&#39;s calling me a baka! 
It&#39;s just another day! In Osaka, in Osaka! Living it up with friends, 
going back to my old ends, they call it new trends, where I live it all 
depends, on Osaka, on Osaka!&quot;

Akari sung along to the Neo Gentatsu Boys song (Osaka!). She always felt 
like this on a fresh morning. The sun was shining, the radio was 
booming, and brand new possibilities were on the horizon. It had been 
two days after that mission to retrieve a power cell from an Asuka Group 
warehouse. Everything had been going well since then. There was a flood 
at the branch of Tokyo Burger she worked at, something about at broken 
pipe. Luckily, Akari hadn&#39;t had to go into work because of that leak, 
now she could just lean back and enjoy being paid for doing nothing for 
the next three weeks. Ryoko had asked her about signing in for a late 
course in a university to occupy more of her time, but Akari just 
refused. She had left academics straight after high school, something 
that she had to do. As soon as Akari hit 18, she wasn&#39;t eligible for 
financial support anymore, regardless of the fact that she had no 
family. So that was the major reason for getting a job. Thankfully, 
Akari was pleased that she hadn&#39;t continued with her studies into 
further education. School was not her strong point, work was. It was 
better for everyone in the long run. 
  
The white-haired girl continued to flick through the magazine on her lap 
and munch down on one of the egg rolls she had left over from last 
night. Re-heated food never tastes as good, but it was better than 
nothing. Between bites, Akari began singing again, till the Neo Gentatsu 
Boys song ended on the radio station. 

&quot;That was this week&#39;s No.2 hit, Osaka! by the Neo Gentatsu Boys, I hope 
you all enjoyed it! Now, before we play a few more rocking tunes, lets 
get hit with a fresh news report by our resident anchor, Yoko Zaibashi!&quot;
                  
&quot;Thanks, Nobosaki.&quot; Yoko said over the radio. &quot;In a fresh breaking 
report, the Korean government and its leader Kyoung Sunh Jun has 
released their response to the UN&#39;s call for peace talks between the 
rebel Korean Guerrilla forces and the Japanese Special Forces. With a 
great determination, Sunh Jun has claimed no connection to the 
simultaneous terrorist attacks on the cities of Matsue, Shimonoseki and 
Fukuoka. In addition, he has denied that the Korean Army have use of any 
weaponry that was used so ruthlessly in the attacks, not least of which 
being the experimental marionette battle androids that the Japanese 
government had released details of in the wake of last year&#39;s failed 
disarmament pledge. Kyoung Sunh Jun has expressed his sorrow for the 
loss of life in the three attacked cities, but will hold no 
responsibility for the actions of the &#39;White Blade&#39; terrorist force. It 
is yet unknown how he will help in mediating the conflict between Japan 
and the post-war rebels, but he has assured the press of his role in 
future developments of this issue and of his dedication in supporting 
the Japanese government in subduing the White Blade terrorists. On 
lighter news...&quot;

Akari sighed. Things kept boiling over and over with that issue. Not 
that she cared much, but then she was not indifferent, either. Back in 
2037, Korea (under the leadership of its former leader, Minh Kou) 
assumed the position of a military state and had begun to alter laws in 
such a way that they had more or less reaffirmed a dictator&#39;s position 
of power with legal means. It had been only until Korea (in 2047) 
launched a missile-testing programme in the islands outside of the 
Korean straits that Japan began to realize that they were the next focus 
in Minh Kou&#39;s bid for power. The Japanese responded to this illegal 
testing with a plea to the UN to place a stern form of tariff on major 
Korean imports until Minh Kou agreed to leave islands, which had 
belonged, by right, to the state of Japan. The UN refused to impose 
tariffs on Minh Kou, further angering the Japanese parliament. It was 
the general belief in Japan that America had denied the tariffs out of 
spite, due to the &#39;Second Cold War&#39; that had formed between Japan and 
the US over the marionette debate. So when Minh Kou, with some glee, 
continued to test his missile programme on the islands outside of the 
Korean straits, the Japanese responded with a brutal attack on November 
21st 2047. Minh Kou and the Korean army knew full well that they could 
use propaganda to twist that into a declaration of war, and by December 
of that year, the Korean army had done just that. 

The Korean-Japanese war of 2048 was no joke by any standard. It 
stretched out for almost eight years until the Korean government had 
surrendered due to exhaustion of resources. That was the war that saw 
the first official military use of the marionette units as a standard 
weapon. The robotic dolls, shaped like Mobile Shells but running on a 
prototype form of battle-based AI. Those ruthless killing machines had 
stolen so many lives during the war that Korea had no choice but to 
surrender. Once the Korean government was restored in 2056 (last year) 
Minh Kou was executed amid cheers and tears of the people who had 
suffered his subjugation for over 19 years. But the world had become 
suspicious of Japan and the use of the marionette units. Even though 
countries such as America, Germany, Russia and Britain had begun their 
own manufacturing of marionettes, no country in the world had 
technological superiority over the Japanese models. Thusly, in the 
current year, Japan had gotten into a sort of arms race with both 
America and Russia, all three countries building up levels of marionette 
units so numerous that it seemed like the world was on the dawn of a new 
age of warfare and destruction. 

The current threat to the world could be solely placed on one faction, 
the financial company that had manufactured and designed the marionette 
units, their original creators. The Asuka Group. 

All of the current madness was down to Asuka Group, Akari was sure of 
that much. They had single-handedly isolated Japan from the rest of the 
world, and put the country into disfavour with the United Nations. And 
what was worse, the Asuka Group had not stopped manufacturing these 
marionette units for use in warfare. The current terrorist attacks by 
the Korean Post-war separatists (the White Blade) were a simple reminder 
of the discontent that the earth felt with Japan. But they also served 
another purpose. By presenting another threat to the security of the 
Japanese state, the White Blade was giving the government the perfect 
excuse for using the new, more modern marionette units on the field of 
battle. 

It was another of the many reasons why Akari was so determined to stop 
the Asuka Group. They were jeopardising the security of Japan in all 
ways possible. And more than that, they were creating a new threat to 
mankind. The marionette unit... though it acted and fought like a human, 
it was still just a machine. Now the whole world was arming themselves 
with such weapons. But they weren&#39;t really &#39;weapons&#39; anymore. The world 
was creating mechanical soldiers, to fight the fights they were too 
cowardly to fight and had recklessly started. Clich&eacute; as it sounded, the 
Asuka Group, and the world for that matter, were cheapening the meaning 
of being a soldier, and the value of straightforward human labours.

&quot;Damn Asuka Group.&quot; Akari said scornfully. &quot;Making machines fight like 
human beings. What&#39;s the point of a war if the people don&#39;t fight it? 
It&#39;s like children playing with plastic swords... nothing but a game. 
And it&#39;s always the children behind the swords who regret their actions 
when one gets fucked up by the other... so... so why do they keep doing 
it... why do we keep doing this to each other?&quot;

Just as Akari thought that statement over, her videophone went off. 
Akari took one last bite of her egg roll, munching it down, then putting 
aside her magazine. The young girl, dressed only in her oversized 
Tokyo-Zappers (current champs of the national baseball league) 
sweatshirt, plopped over to the ringing videophone, tapped a few keys on 
the keypad, bringing up the image of the caller on the screen. Ryoko. 

&quot;Morning, sunshine.&quot; Ryoko said beaming.

Akari rubbed her eyes a bit. &quot;Did you hear the news? Kyoung Sunh Jun 
says he ain&#39;t part of the White Blade. I guess this will put a hold on 
the plans for those Asuka Group guys, huh?&quot;

&quot;Not quite.&quot; Responded Ryoko. &quot;The testing of the new marionettes may 
not be taken on the White Blade. It looks like the Asuka Group has 
convinced the government to play it safe. I think that the Asuka Group 
are going to test them outside of real combat. On you.&quot;

Akari blinked. &quot;You&#39;re kidding!? You think those marionettes that I 
fought a couple days ago are part of the new line that the Asuka Group 
has been commissioned to make by the Army?&quot;

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me. Think about it. It explains why two of the 
marionettes you faced didn&#39;t malfunction when you doused them with water 
in the warehouse.&quot;

&quot;But that warehouse was smack bang in the middle of Shibuya!&quot; Akari 
said. &quot;They wouldn&#39;t actually test those things on me when we&#39;re inside 
Tokyo would they?&quot;

Ryoko shut her eyes. &quot;Remember who we are dealing with, Akari. The Asuka 
Group is ruthless. We have to be prepared for anything that they send at 
you. As soon as the government finds out what the Asuka Group is really 
like, they can be stopped. But until then, we have to keep them from 
unveiling the new line of marionettes. Those things can cause more 
damage than we ever believed.&quot;

&quot;Tell me what I need to do!&quot; Pleaded Akari. &quot;As long as the White Orchid 
Mobile Shell stays true to me, Tokyo Blossom can handle anything.&quot;

&quot;Good. I have information on something that could help us. Since the new 
line of marionettes will be revealed in three weeks time, we have to be 
fast. The marionettes run on a chip that is linked to the same satellite 
that houses the space cannon (World Slayer), the NOA3. Without this 
chip, marionette units cannot operate to their fullest potential. But it 
is a one of a kind make, so they can only be copied right now, not 
remade. At least not without some great effort.&quot;

Akari sighed. &quot;Okay... and exactly what has this got to do with 
anything?&quot;

&quot;The chip that is being copied is called the CFL, Cybernetic Feedback 
Link. A train is transporting it to Yokohama tonight. If you can sneak 
onto that train and destroy the chip, the Asuka Group&#39;s plans will be 
delayed for months. The train is leaving from Shinjuku ni station at 
8.00 tonight. Just get yourself on it and you should have no problems.&quot;

&quot;How am supposed to get back to Tokyo without being caught out?&quot;

Ryoko scratched the back of her head. &quot;Well... I haven&#39;t really... come 
up with a solution to that just yet so, you&#39;ll have to bare with me, I 
guess...&quot;

&quot;Are you out of you&#39;re mind?!&quot; Akari yelled. &quot;How am I gonna get home?&quot;

&quot;Just destroy the thing as early as you can. Yokohama is only about 
twenty miles away from the nearest checkpoint. If you finish the job by 
then...&quot;

Akari&#39;s bright eyes rolled. &quot;I suppose I don&#39;t have much choice.&quot;

**********

7.53, Shinjuku ni station. Tokyo Blossom leaned against the wall of the 
alley leading up the nearest train platform. It was going to be pretty 
easy to get on the train, but extremely difficult to keep from getting 
discovered. Armed guards of the Asuka Group constantly patrolled the 
stone platform leading up to the automatic opening ports of the train. 
Tokyo Blossom&#39;s anger was with the machinery of the Asuka Group, not its 
human operatives, but there was no way she could let her feelings stand 
in the way of seizing the CFL chip. Human or not, she had to complete 
her mission as given to her by Ryoko. 

The armoured girl leaned her head toward the gap of the alleyway, and 
studied the armaments on one of the soldiers at the platform. Her x-ray 
scanners eyed the man over, going beyond his clothing, flesh and blood 
and probed all that he could possible be holding. Aside from the large 
laser blaster in his hands, there was a knife at his leg, a revolver at 
the other leg, and a set of spare bullets around the man&#39;s waist. 

&quot;Looks like the Asuka Group mean business.&quot; Tokyo B said. And with good 
reason. The guard was armed to the teeth with weapons. Though none of 
them stood a chance against Tokyo B&#39;s arsenal, any normal person could 
prove to be a problem for them as well. Just goes to show how forward 
thinking humans can be. Tokyo Blossom switched off the x-ray sensors of 
the White Orchid suit and returned to normal vision. There were only 
three guards on this side of the platform. If she snuck past them, as 
quickly as the Mobile Shell would allow, maybe she could reach one of 
those entry ports undetected. 

Tokyo B decided that was the only possible way, and went for it. The 
armoured girl steeled her will to succeed, let the necessary juices flow 
and dashed out of the alleyway and across the platform. None of the 
guards noticed the quick flash of white and blue, and with some glee, 
Tokyo B ran into one of the entry ports of the train. She stopped 
running as she entered the train&#39;s third cart, the third of the total 
ten. Ryoko&#39;s sources had told her that the chip was in the second cart, 
just one ahead. 
 
&quot;Alright!&quot; Tokyo Blossom whispered. &quot;Maybe I can destroy the chip 
without even leaving the station!&quot;

The confident armour girl slowly began to amble to the door linking cart 
3 with cart 2, treading as carefully as she possibly could. Though this 
train didn&#39;t quite seem as advanced as others of this day and age, 
weight sensors could have been installed under the steel of the floor. 
With the weight of the White Orchid, she would have been easily detected 
if that were the case. Tokyo Blossom continued to idly walk down the 
path to the door, past the crates of goods and parts that the Asuka 
Group would be transporting to Yokohama. Eventually, Tokyo B came to the 
door. Her sensors had already picked up on the system lock keeping that 
thick door closed. Still, it was no problem for the White Orchid, when 
it had contact with Ryoko. 

&quot;Ryoko?&quot; Tokyo Blossom whispered. &quot;Can you hear me?&quot;

&quot;Yup. Speak on.&quot;

&quot;I need the codes for the system lock on the door to the second cart of 
the train.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot; Ryoko answered. &quot;The code is 00912740.&quot; 

Tokyo B memorized the code, and tapped it into the keypad hung next to 
the door. After the metallic fingers of her power gauntlet finished 
their jobs, the voice response of the system lock spoke out. 

&quot;CODE VERIFIED.&quot; It said. &quot;ACCESS APPROVED.&quot; 

The door slid to one side, allowing Tokyo B access into the second cart 
of the train, She ran in without a qualm in the world, but stopped and 
looked on in utter shock when she realized that... 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing here!&quot; She barked. &quot;What the hell is this?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom studied the place over. There was absolutely nothing in 
the entire cart. Not even a crate or bag or something. However, she was 
unprepared for the next revelation that was about to unfold. Each of the 
doors, one on either side of the cart, locked down straight away, 
sealing up the cart. Before Tokyo B even knew what was happening, more 
began to unfold. The windows that allowed partial view of the outside 
suddenly closed up by metal plates, each one blocking out whatever light 
that could possibly reach inwards. Aside from the locks on both doors, 
there was nothing in that cart except for Tokyo Blossom. And she herself 
couldn&#39;t understand what was happening.

That was until a voice called out to her from a hidden intercom. &quot;Ha, 
ha, ha, ha! I knew that by spreading false rumours about the CFL chip 
that you would come here. Such a fatal mistake for the wielder of White 
Orchid to make.&quot;

Tokyo B growled. &quot;Shit. It was a damn set-up...&quot;

&quot;Correct!&quot; The voice jabbed. &quot;A trap you yourself have walked straight 
into. You see, we in the Asuka Group cannot have a loose cannon running 
about in that suit you wear. The White Orchid rightfully belongs to us. 
By using it against us, you&#39;ve dug your own grave.&quot;

&quot;Damn you!&quot; Tokyo B cursed.

The voice spoke back in surprise. &quot;What is the matter? Have you no 
brilliant plan to escape? No clever plan of freedom? No? I thought so. 
Did you honestly believe that we would allow the most important tool for 
our ambitions to be carried to and fro on a rickety train such as this?&quot;

Tokyo Blossom managed to smile. &quot;The thought had crossed my mind.&quot;

&quot;Then more fool you. You shall pay for your arrogance. But I suppose 
you&#39;ve done us a great debt anyway. Thanks to you, we now have evidence 
that there is a spy or traitor in the Asuka Group. We will find the 
person who gave you the information... and deal with them.&quot;

&quot;If you hurt a hair on her head, I&#39;ll destroy you!&quot;

&quot;So it&#39;s a woman?&quot; The voice responded. &quot;You just make this easier and 
easier.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom blinked hard. She couldn&#39;t believe this. And now, Ryoko 
might be in danger from the Asuka Group. If they found out that she had 
been the one supplying Tokyo B with that information, then they would 
surely kill her. The armoured girl had to find a distraction from this. 

&quot;Tell me where the real CFL chip is!&quot; Tokyo B demanded.

The voice chuckled under his breath. &quot;I&#39;m offended that you still 
believe that you can escape. But, I am a fair person, I shall make a 
deal with you. If you somehow survive what I have planned for you, and 
we someday face each other in combat, and you manage to defeat me, I&#39;ll 
tell you its location. I think that&#39;s fair... heh, heh, heh, heh...&quot;

Defeat him? &quot;Are... are you a pilot of one of... the six Mobile Shells?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am. I will not ask for your name, since I doubt greatly that you 
are foolish enough to give it to me, but I will tell you about me. I am 
known as Shigure Kagami. I am the pilot of the Omega Mobile Shell and 
captain of Asuka Group&#39;s personal marionette guard. I live only to bring 
about the wishes and desires of our leader and benefactor.&quot;

&quot;...Your leader...?&quot; Tokyo Blossom questioned. &quot;Who... is that?&quot;

Shigure laughed once more. &quot;You are not worthy to speak the name of our 
queen. And this little chat is over. Prepare yourself, Tokyo Blossom. 
You shall taste the fury of the Attack Corps!&quot;

**********

A strong wind blew into the campsite. Blades of grass and branches of 
trees were ripped apart by the ferocity of the winds passing into 
Yokohama. Being that this was the middle of the night, no one had 
expected to face such a wind. But then, plans that go to a direct 
schedule will suffer from the risk of overlooked problems, one of them 
being climate. Some of the armed guards stationed around the three large 
tents hugged themselves to get over the coldness of the breeze. But at 
least none of the artillery was being damaged. Both the four Land Golems 
and the Ground Crab were armed and ready to roll. The mecha stood 
proudly around the campsite, as if they were totally unaffected by the 
strong winds that were making life miserable for the soldiers of the 
Attack Corps. 

Land Golems were a frightening site. Huge armoured beasts armed with a 
shell cannon around two and a half metres in length. They were clunking, 
large war weapons, like huge tanks forged into a humanoid form. Though 
the Land Golems were painted with a sandy dark yellow, the arms and legs 
of them were also painted over with combat stripes, the traditional 
brown, black and green. It was in no way a form of camouflage, these 
machines were unsuited to guerrilla warfare, but the colours stood as a 
symbol of its place as a war weapon, for what it truly was. Land Golems 
were considered to be to modern warfare, what the stealth jet was to the 
20th century. The only reason that they had been neglected to use as of 
late was because of the rising popularity of the marionette units. But 
the Asuka Group, being the no.1 weapons manufacturer in the world, had 
designed their Golems to the perfect level of power and durability. The 
only drawback was the speed of them. Land Golems averaged at a speed of 
about 0.5 mph, and at maximum speed (which made the contemporary 
targeting system very hard to use) about 1.2 mph. They were completely 
unsuited to stealth missions, but during that age-old battle of 
attrition, the Land Golems were perfect for ground level combat. 
   
The Ground Crab on the other hand, was very different to the Land Golem. 
Ground Crabs were built for ground battle too, but that was where the 
similarities ended. It stood at a height of twelve metres, most of this 
height being given by the two pairs of eleven-metre long steel legs. 
Those four legs allowed the Ground Crab to traverse lands at up to 3 
mph, nearly three times faster than top speed of the Land Golems. Though 
this wasn&#39;t exactly fast either, it was just right for isolated battles. 
The interior of the Ground Crab was about one metre high and two and a 
half metres long. Just large enough for a seated person to man it for 
extended periods of time. The mounted cannon on the helm was the most 
alluring part of the Ground Crab&#39;s charm, however. The cannon fired a 
very powerful shell called the &#39;Valkyrie&#39; that could smash through stone 
and iron like so much butter. But like all weapons, the Ground Crab too 
had its weaknesses. For one thing, the piloting system was very 
complicated, so only highly experienced pilots could operate them.  
Second of all was the cannon itself. Though large and very destructive, 
the time it took to aim was unbearably slow. This meant that to get an 
accurate shot, one had to rely on the positioning of the Ground Crab in 
such a way that the shot was in the right direction. This in turn made 
the need for a capable pilot essential. 

The Land Golems and the Ground Crabs were a perfect match for each other 
on the battlefield. A Ground Crab could destroy a Land Golem in one 
shot, but a Land Golem would easily be able to take down a Ground Crab 
before that shot was ever made, a common rivalry. 

Those weapons stood ready for the challenge, ready for use against 
whatever enemy that Shigure had lined up for the Attack Corps. Though 
this was only a small portion of the AC&#39;s strength, the operatives 
assigned to this mission were some of the best in the business. 
Ex-soldiers that had fought in the Korean-Japanese war, and a commander 
who had led missions against the rebels in Eastern Europe, during the 
Middle Eastern oil shortage riots of 2018. But, the main focus that 
should be taken here was on the youngster that was waiting within the 
confines of those temporary combat tents. This girl was young, looking 
about 17 years in age; her youthful emerald eyes slipped shut and her 
long legs poised diagonally as she sat. But she was not asleep. A 
metallic helmet was attached to her head, resting over her long tresses 
of dark brown hair. The helmet itself was linked up with a mesh of wires 
that trailed over to a computer system. A person manning the computer, 
tapped in code after code, his face glowing with the light from the 
screen. 

&quot;This is amazing!&quot; He said. &quot;Your CMB data is flawless! How is it that 
such a young girl could carry such readings? It&#39;s almost as if you&#39;re 
not human. Hmph! Regardless, your readings do prove your superiority. I 
have no idea why Commander Kagami wanted you to keep you from use on the 
battlefield, though. Your CMB data is too radical to be wasted like 
this... but I suppose that&#39;s why you were transported to Yokohama with 
such urgency, wasn&#39;t it? That journey from Kyoto that we undertook was 
so heavily guarded, it was unbelievable and it is all down to you.&quot;

The man looked over at the girl. &quot;So you shall be enjoying the wonders 
of Tokyo, all too soon. I can tell that a lot of our ambitions hinge on 
you... Kagome.&quot;

Kagome&#39;s bright green eyes fluttered open. &quot;W-Where... am I?&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh!&quot; The man laughed. &quot;You&#39;ve no need to awaken. For this 
test, we need your mind at the most tranquil level possible. Yes... you 
are the perfect test sample for the Marionette Operating System 
Prototype...&quot;

Kagome blinked, still studying her surroundings. &quot;The Marionette 
Operating System Prototype? What are you talking about? Where... who...&quot;

The man sighed. &quot;It seems as if your memory implant as not been 
installed yet. I can understand that. Your suspension was far more 
damaging to your memory than the Asuka Group would believe. Still, the 
tests must run without fail! I only wish I were there to see it... 
regardless... Commander Kagami has ordered our powers to be used. I will 
use you in my own test in the coming battle. So... I need you to be 
asleep, little girl.&quot;

&quot;W-What? But I need to know...&quot; Too late. Kagome&#39;s right hand was 
connected to a thin, long cable attached to a glass cylinder. The liquid 
in the cylinder began to move and shake, as that substance was slowly 
injected into Kagome&#39;s blood stream. Her eyes became heavy in the 
following seconds, and before long she was asleep again. The grinning 
man laughed once more, just before calling in two soldiers. They seemed 
to know instantly want he wanted so walked over to Kagome&#39;s sleeping 
form. They lifted the helmet from her head, and unattached the wires and 
cables around her wrists, then pulled her up from the chair. She was 
dressed in Asuka Group combat uniform, a bomber jacket and mesh jeans in 
their traditional colours of black and gold, so she was not very hard to 
carry. One of the soldiers slung the girl over his arms, Kagome&#39;s own 
arms dangling down as she continued to sleep, then walked out of the 
tent with the other soldier. Striding past the armed guards around the 
camp, they made their way to one of the Land Golems that had already 
been optimised and were ready to go. 

The soldier holding Kagome stood back, while the other resisted the wind 
and tapped a small button at the joint of the Land Golem&#39;s right leg. 
With a lean puff of a sound, the back of the Golem disjointed from the 
body, and swung back slowly, giving entry to the cockpit. The soldier 
carrying Kagome grunted, then stood on the newly created platform, 
sliding Kagome into the Golem&#39;s interior. He slipped her hands into 
sensor-activated gauntlets, the sensory leg openings, and then pulled 
out the headgear hanging off the Land Golem&#39;s outer armour. He strapped 
it onto Kagome&#39;s head then jumped off, stepping off the back of the Land 
Golem. The back of the walking tank slowly moved back into place, 
sealing Kagome inside it. She was now ready for the test to begin, for 
her mind to be tested.

One of the soldiers took out a receiver from his pocket. &quot;Tell the 
doctor that Test Sample 000 is ready to begin.&quot;

**********

&quot;Dah, dah, dah, DAH!!!!&quot;

Tokyo B thrust punch after punch at the walls of the sealed off train, 
but the steel knuckles of her armour could do nothing to break them. She 
could not believe how easily she had walked into this trap. And now, 
Ryoko was probably in danger. As soon as Shigure launched an 
investigation into who was leaking out Asuka Group information, they 
would eventually trace it down to Ryoko and whoever had been helping 
her. Tokyo Blossom had to get out and get back to Tokyo so she could 
protect Ryoko. The only problem was this train. It hadn&#39;t stopped moving 
for the past hour. And considering how old it was, the thing seemed to 
be moving pretty fast. Tokyo Blossom just hoped that the destination was 
still Yokohama. She had been there before, so it would be easy to find 
her way back. As soon as she dealt with whatever Shigure had in store 
for her, that is. 

&quot;Dammit.&quot; Said Tokyo Blossom irately. &quot;I&#39;ve gotta get out of here.&quot;

Then, all of a sudden, the train came to a stop. Tokyo looked around to 
see if there was anything coming. The entire cart was still sealed off. 
That was, until, the four walls came crashing down. One after the other, 
each of the blocked off steel walls went down, revealing the location of 
the train. The train had taken Tokyo B to the outer grasslands 
surrounding the Greater Tokyo district. Tokyo itself was miles away, as 
was Yokohama. But that wasn&#39;t what caught Tokyo Blossom&#39;s full 
attention. What grabbed her attention the most was the reception waiting 
for her. The metal of the train did not block Tokyo B&#39;s scanners 
anymore, so she could clearly see everything that was going on around 
her. Circling the train, were some of the Asuka Group&#39;s most severe 
mechanics, four Land Golem mechas, and a Ground Crab, all armed and 
ready to take down their target. Tokyo B sneered behind the glassy 
plastic of her visor. Shigure really had set her up good, but there was 
no way she was going to die here. Least not while Ryoko needed 
protecting. One of the Land Golems, to Tokyo B&#39;s left, aimed the cannon 
in its arms toward Tokyo B&#39;s position on the deck of the newly revealed 
train. Without qualm it fired, shooting a huge shell at Tokyo Blossom. 
The armoured girl&#39;s computer sensors picked up on this, and she dove out 
of the way, the shot blowing up the train cart in a furious explosion of 
flame, dust, metal and grass. A roaring flame surged up from the charred 
base of the blasted train cart, behind the alert Tokyo B, giving some 
new light to the black coldness of the Japanese grasslands. 

&quot;At least my armour is working at full power this time around.&quot; Tokyo B 
supplied. &quot;That tips the scales in a different angle this time.&quot;

Tokyo B laughed deviously as her metal-swathed arm went to the back of 
her suit, to the hilt of her beaming sword. The steel of the blade had 
been polished and re-sharpened by the efforts of Ryoko, using the finest 
precision of acids and micro-lasers. The edge of the blade was at most 
no thicker than one thousandth of a millimetre. Which meant that it 
could literally cut through anything, even through metals as tough and 
durable as titanium. Tokyo Blossom withdrew the gleaming blade from its 
confines on her back, pulling it free into the air, the light of the 
blade a blinding sight in this great darkness. 

The armour girl ran forward, towards the Land Golem that had shot at 
her, holding the sword of her armour downwards, gripping at the hilt 
with the skill of a seasoned swordfighter. The attacking Land Golem 
began to slowly move over to the right, firing another of its shells 
while the remaining Golems re-positioned themselves. Tokyo B approached 
the Land Golem with no fear, and jumped over the shell that had been 
fired at her. She somersaulted midair, her armour strong but light, 
descending near the back of the Land Golem. Tokyo B knew Land Golems 
well, they were piloted and most vulnerable from behind, so drew back 
her sword, positioned it, and then thrust it into the rear of the mecha. 
Tokyo B ignored the death cry of the man inside as he was impaled on her 
sword, and then jumped away as the clunking mecha crashed to the ground, 
no longer able to stand without a living pilot.  

&quot;Sakukachi is dead!&quot; One of the other Land Golem pilots said. &quot;Kill that 
Mobile Shell&#39;s pilot!&quot;

The three active Land Golems fired all at once at Tokyo Blossom. The 
Mobile Shell girl was as watchful as ever she had been, and ran around 
the trail of the blasts, her ample feet dodging each and every shot. As 
she ran around the line of fire, Tokyo Blossom sheathed her blade, then 
brought up her arms to fire at the Land Golem furthest right from her. 
The red gem at her wrist gathered power, like a magnet attracting metal, 
and as it had done before, it began to glow with a potent bright crimson 
light. Tokyo B growled as she shot an energy bolt from it, the blast 
careening into the cockpit of the Land Golem. It exploded in an instant, 
whipping up a wave of dust, which blew across to the other Land Golems, 
the perfect cover for Tokyo B. The woman lowered her firing arm and ran 
forwards, chasing down the Golems in the dust, then jumped up into the 
air a second time. Her sensors were advanced enough to see through this 
misty dust with no effort, so her abilities were not hindered by the 
distraction. Tokyo Blossom grabbed the head of the Land Golem and she 
flipped over it, dragging the metal goliath downwards with her. Just 
before it came crashing to the ground, Tokyo Blossom thrust her fist 
against the metal plates of the Land Golem&#39;s rear, breaking through the 
armour till it reached the interior. The pilot screamed as Tokyo B&#39;s 
fist knocked the wind right out of him, and then the girl herself pulled 
out her fist and leapt away. 

The Land Golem smashed into the grassy ground, the suit catching fire 
due to Tokyo B&#39;s gauntlet running through its power unit. But Tokyo B 
was less concerned with that, and more concerned with the Ground Crab. 
It seemed to have disappeared from sight, but not for long. The Crab was 
right behind Tokyo B!

The Ground Crab&#39;s mounted cannon fired a huge blast at Tokyo Blossom, 
the sound of the firing echoing through nightly scene of destruction. 
Tokyo B screamed as she was tossed high into the air by the impact, the 
shell narrowly missing her. She was flung around with the shards of 
blasted dirt and grass, until she rolled along the ground from landing. 

&quot;Uh, man...&quot; Tokyo Blossom groaned. &quot;What the heck are those things 
packing?&quot;

As soon as she heard the click of that Ground Crab&#39;s cannon again, Tokyo 
B leapt to her feet. That thing&#39;s artillery had to be army-level. There 
was no way a blast like that could have been created by a standard issue 
shell. Tokyo B withdrew her sword again, and then put her focus on the 
Ground Crab&#39;s legs. 

&quot;That thing&#39;s too tall to take down from the cockpit.&quot; Tokyo Blossom 
said. &quot;But those legs are just as vulnerable...&quot;

Tokyo B ran towards the Ground Crab, its aiming system was too slow to 
keep up with her movements. The armoured girl took no notice of the 
pilot&#39;s trouble however, and readied her sword to strike. In one clean 
slice, Tokyo B hacked off the two right legs of the Ground Crab, 
destroying whatever balance it thought that it had. Then as it tilted to 
the side with its fall, Tokyo B jumped up and thrust her sword into the 
cockpit, skewering the pilot like hot meat on a kebab. She ripped the 
now bloody sword from the core of the Ground Crab, and then leapt back 
from the machine. 

&quot;Not good enough, Shigure.&quot; Tokyo Blossom said. &quot;Not good enough.&quot;

But there was one last thing to take care of; the last Land Golem needed 
destroying. But strangely, that Land Golem had not made much of an 
assault on her. Regardless, Tokyo B ran over to the remaining Land 
Golem, her sword in hand; looking to finish off the job, then get back 
to Tokyo to protect Ryoko. The woman brought up her sword; a little 
confused by the way the Land Golem would not attack her, then sliced at 
the front of the mecha in a circular motion. The sleek steel of the 
sword did rend the armour with ease, and it revealed the pilot of the 
Land Golem in all her glory. Just as easily as Tokyo B was driven to 
attack, that instinct fell into nothing, as her eyes gazed upon the 
beautiful brown haired girl, lying asleep in the cockpit. 

There was no way for Tokyo Blossom to know that her own cheeks were 
flowering with an innocent and unexpected blush. &quot;W-Who... is she...?&quot;
