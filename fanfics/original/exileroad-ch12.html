<h1>Exile's Road (part 12 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/exileroad-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The Countess Hazan and Ra&#39;hel followed Jantha through
the house to the drawing room, feeling the two guards
wary gazes on her. &#39;Especially the tall one,&#39; the
handsome woman noted, reaching up to push her black
hair back.

Taking swift glances she assessed the woman, coming to
some quick conclusions. By the cast of her features
she was an outlander, but unlike most of those she
moved with both strength and confidence. Her short
black hair suited the simple garb she wore, muscles
coiled on her arms and from what she could see on her
legs, too. If the rumors were true she was a bodyguard
and hire-sword, retained to protect the Duchess
against foreign assassins.

&quot;Love,&quot; Ra&#39;hel said to her softly, &quot;from her comment
it seems the other guard may be a member of our guild,
but I suspect that would not sway her in her duty.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d think less of her if we could influence her,&quot;
Hazan answered mildly, smiling down at the other woman
tenderly.

The drawing room they soon entered was simply
decorated, couches and chairs set around the room for
guests to sit. Unusually Jantha didn&#39;t invite them to
sit, the lovely blonde frowning as she said, &quot;What do
you want, Countess?&quot;

Hazan hid her dismay at the cold tone of voice, though
it was harder than she expected. She had heard that
Jantha didn&#39;t like her much, but she hadn&#39;t expected
it to be quite so bad. Silently she cursed the sudden
impulse that had once lead to her attempting to seduce
the Duchess Jantha so long ago, and how badly she had
messed it up.

Elisa knocked then came in with a tray, several
bottles and glasses resting on it. &quot;I&#39;ll just leave
these here,&quot; the maid bowed, then swiftly retreated
from the tension filled room.

&quot;May I?&quot; Hazan asked as she gestured to the bottles,
stalling a bit while she tried to decide how best to
make her pitch.

&quot;Be my guest,&quot; Jantha said then sighed, &quot;take a seat
while you&#39;re at it.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ra&#39;hel bowed slightly then sat, careful
to keep her skirts neat as she watched Hazan pour them
both drinks.

&quot;Interesting atmosphere,&quot; the tawny haired one
murmured to the tall fighter, &quot;what do you think,
Midori?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen this side of Jantha before,
Laur&#39;ien,&quot; Midori answered her mildly, keeping a wary
look at both guests.

&#39;Midori, I wonder if she&#39;s the same one as the star of
that new ballad?&#39; Hazan wondered at overhearing the
guard&#39;s name, then she banished that stray thought.
Facing Jantha she took a drink and began, &quot;As most of
the county&#39;s nobles are, I am aware of the somewhat...
precarious position that our new Queen is in.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean,&quot; Jantha kept her voice
mild.

&quot;While our Queen has the support of some of the
members of our nobility, her position is far from
secure,&quot; Hazan said coolly, feeling a faint admiration
in her heart at the woman&#39;s reserve. She drank again
then set the glass down on a nearby table, &quot;I have
come here with a offer, a certain exchange of favors
to propose....&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jantha asked, &quot;what would that be?&quot;

&quot;I can promise the support of the entire Guild of
Gentlewomen for the Queen,&quot; Hazan said crisply to her
crisply, &quot;an not inconsiderable force. In exchange for
that we only want an official recognition of our
guild.&quot;

&quot;The guild council controls such things,&quot; Jantha
pointed out that fact, her eyes narrowing, &quot;not the
Queen.&quot;

&quot;If the Queen requests,&quot; Hazan pointed out, &quot;I doubt
they would resist her, knowing it was in their own
best interests to cooperate.&quot;

Dryly Midori spoke up, &quot;And what sort of help could
the Queen expect from your Guild of noblewomen,
merchant&#39;s wives and street walkers, anyway?&quot;

&quot;You underestimate us,&quot; Hazan frowned at Midori,
wondering why Jantha didn&#39;t just order her bodyguard
to be silent. Rather annoyingly Jantha looked more
amused by the interruption, so she likely couldn&#39;t
expect help from her.

Midori raised an eyebrow, &quot;Maybe so, but I recognized
your friend right away from when she worked the dark
corners in the Drunken Bard.&quot;

&quot;I thought I recognized you too,&quot; Ra&#39;hel admitted with
a glare, &quot;bouncer. But aren&#39;t you far away from the
tavern, too?&quot; She took a calming breath, &quot;I left that
life months ago, in part due to the aid from members
of the Guild of Gentlewoman.&quot;

Hazan felt a flash of pride for the young woman,
trying not to let a smile creep across her face.
Getting back to Midori&#39;s first question she continued,
&quot;Wives of merchants and nobles can exert a great deal
of influence, as well as gathering information that
could be very useful, too.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien spoke up, though she sounded somewhat
reluctant to. &quot;The Guild counts as it&#39;s members many
female swordswomen, too,&quot; she said, &quot;much like myself,
and we could rally them to the Queen&#39;s aide.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d normally assume they&#39;d come to the Queen&#39;s
assistance willingly,&quot; Jantha frowned as Laur&#39;ien just
gave her a skeptical look.

Hazan tried to hide her amusement, glad that the Guild
had been trying to recruit female members of the
guards. &quot;There are many things we can help the Queen
with,&quot; she said seriously, &quot;if she can help us.&quot;

Jantha studied them, her expression carefully blank
then finally said, &quot;I&#39;ll give you this, you don&#39;t give
up.&quot;

&quot;Where would the profit be in that?&quot; Ra&#39;hel said with
a grin.

A faint smile appeared on Jantha&#39;s face as she said,
&quot;All right, I&#39;ll bring your request to the queen.&quot;
Cautiously she said, &quot;I can not make any promises
other than that, for my cousin is both a willful and
unpredictable woman.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all we can ask,&quot; Hazan said respectfully,
nodding her head. She finished her drink then smiled
slightly, &quot;With your permission I and my companion
will be leaving.&quot;

Ra&#39;hel rose gracefully, slipping across the room to
Hazan&#39;s side. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she curtsied gracefully,
&quot;for your hospitality.&quot;

A wry smile quirked her lips as Jantha said
insincerely, &quot;We must do it again sometime.&quot; She
looked to Laur&#39;ien, &quot;Would you escort them out?&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Laur&#39;ien bowed slightly then followed Hazan
and Ra&#39;hel out through the halls.

&quot;Thank you for your words of support,&quot; Ra&#39;hel said
softly as they walked through the house, &quot;I hope they
won&#39;t get you in trouble with the lady.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Laur&#39;ien sighed.

&quot;If it is trouble,&quot; Hazan added, &quot;we&#39;ll offer what
help we can.&quot;

&quot;M&#39;lady,&quot; Elisa nodded as they reached the doors, the
redheaded maid passing over their cloaks, then with a
wry smile Ra&#39;hel&#39;s knives.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Ra&#39;hel gracefully slid the blades away.

Hazan tried not to let her annoyance show at the
maid&#39;s keeping them waiting outside, her voice faintly
sarcastic as she said, &quot;Thank you for your
hospitality.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve very welcome,&quot; Elisa kept her voice mild as
they walked out.

&quot;Behave, love,&quot; Ra&#39;hel chided softly as they headed
off down the street, &quot;I suspect the Duchess made it
clear her opinion of us the first visit.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Hazan conceded. She scowled and added,
&quot;Damn me for a fool, I knew I should have kept my
hands to myself when we were younger.&quot;

Ra&#39;hel actually snickered softly. &quot;You were both drunk
at the time, from what you told me,&quot; she pointed out.

&quot;I know,&quot; Hazan grumped, &quot;but I never expected her to
carry the grudge this long.&quot;

&quot;At least she pledged to take our offer to the Queen,&quot;
Ra&#39;hel said with a grin, &quot;I think that&#39;s a major step
forward.&quot;

&quot;Now we just have to make sure no one deposes her
before she can recognize our Guild,&quot; Hazan said with a
thoughtful smile.

&quot;Easy enough,&quot; Ra&#39;hel said breezily, getting a laugh
from the other woman.</pre>
