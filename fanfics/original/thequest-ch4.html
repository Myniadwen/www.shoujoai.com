<h1>The Quest: A Fractured Fairy Tale (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/thequest-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m really very sorry,&quot; Charming said sheepishly as
they rode away from yet another rescue, the adoring
female fans looking a bit disappointed at their
leaving. The beautiful blonde haired young woman
looked so boyish it was easy to understand the girls
interest, especially with her fine cloak and
gleamingly clean clothes. Oddly her companion didn&#39;t
notice that a fair bit of the interest was, in fact,
being directed towards her.

&quot;No more side trips,&quot; Snow White growled out, her own
long black hair tied back to try to keep it out of her
face. &quot;We&#39;ve probably added a few days to the trip as
it is,&quot; she scowled, noting with some irritation how
messy her own garb was. The chain mail had begun to
rust, despite her attempts to scour it clean, and the
cotton undershirt was stained and getting a bit rank.
Her cloak was muddy, the once flowing cloth heavy and
uncomfortable.

Charming nodded glumly. &quot;There are just so many people
in need,&quot; she explained quietly, &quot;I fear I find it
difficult to turn away.&quot;

They rode on, Rosebud and Charming&#39;s noble steed
moving at a steady pace along the highway towards Snow
White&#39;s homeland and her waiting sister. &quot;Me, too,&quot;
she finally conceded, &quot;but we have other concerns,
too.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Charming brightened slightly, &quot;did Rose
really miss me?&quot;

Snow grit her teeth to keep herself from saying
something rude. Variations of this conversation had
been going on for the last few days as they journeyed
onward and she was getting more than a little tired of
it. &quot;She was heart broken over losing you,&quot; she said
patiently.

Charming frowned, still looking adorable as she did
so. &quot;Your mother is going to be upset, though,&quot; she
fretted.

&#39;I wonder if Rose would be upset if I just clubbed
Charming unconscious and then hauled her home?&#39; she
thought. Discarding that idea Snow continued, &quot;Rose
has my mother wrapped around her finger, if you make
Rose happy then my mother will be happy.&quot;

As they passed a nearby village a young woman raced
forth, her dress low-cut and breasts bouncing so much
even Rose was distracted. &quot;Wandering heroes, I&#39;m so
glad you gentlemen came,&quot; she sighed, &quot;we need your
help!&quot;

&#39;Gentlemen?&#39; Snow blinked, then as she saw Charming&#39;s
eyes light up eagerly she groaned, &#39;Oh no, not
again....&#39;

It did turn out to take a bit over a week of travel to
finally reach the castle, a hectic week of adventures
for the both of them. First there was the great wyrm
threatening a village, then a giant who was blocking
the pass and finally another maiden being threatened
by a hulking troll. It was that last rescue that was
bothering Snow now....

The troll itself hadn&#39;t been that much trouble, in all
honestly. Usually nocturnal creatures, the troll was
dumb and slow in the heat of the summer sun and
together the two of them had been able to lure it into
a deep crevasse that was nearby. Snow knocked it off
balance and down it went, eventually landing wit a
loud thump. Not enough to kill it, but that would slow
it down a while.

Returning to free the maiden the fail lady had rushed
right by Charming, ignoring the woman, and instead
pressed herself to Snow White, her shredded dress now
scandalously revealing. &quot;Oh thank you,&quot; she exclaimed
before pressing her lips to Snow&#39;s.

&quot;Urk,&quot; Snow couldn&#39;t even talk for a moment, even more
startled to feel the girl&#39;s eager tongue gently
pressing against her own lips. Gently she disengaged,
a fierce blush coloring her cheeks as she softly said
to her, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I am now,&quot; she purred, long red hair flowing over her
shoulders as she looked up to meet Snow&#39;s eyes hotly.

Charming looked like she wanted to laugh, her eyes
nearly dancing. &quot;I thought you said we were in a
hurry?&quot; Charming asked.

&quot;Right,&quot; Snow seized on that, quickly putting some
distance between herself and the amorous young lady,
&quot;we have, uhm, a quest! Right!&quot; With that she mounted
Rosebud, Charming soon following as they moved off.

&quot;Awww,&quot; the beautiful girl pouted, sticking out her
bottom lip adorably as the two heroes rode off with
undue haste.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Charming asked the blushing Snow.

&quot;What was that about?!&quot; Snow squeaked.

&quot;You mean your mother never explained?&quot; Charming
blinked innocently. She took a breath and started,
&quot;Well, you see it happens when a man and a women come
together, and....&quot;

&quot;Not the birds and the bees,&quot; Snow snapped at her
before gesturing back towards the ruined keep they
were riding away from, &quot;I mean that woman back there!&quot;

Charming looked over at her thoughtfully, suddenly
seeming serious. &quot;You haven&#39;t looked in the mirror
lately?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Snow said irritably.

&quot;With your clothes, hair tied back and no makeup,&quot;
Charming explained to Snow patiently, &quot;you look like
an adventurer, not a princess looking for her sister&#39;s
betrothed.&quot;

&quot;She thought I was a man?&quot; Snow blinked.

&quot;Or at least she found you attractive,&quot; with a sudden
smile Charming shrugged, &quot;there are woman adventurers,
too.&quot;

&quot;Never mind,&quot; Snow shook her head, &quot;it doesn&#39;t
matter.&quot;

Now, as they went up over a hill and saw the first
view of her kingdom&#39;s castle Snow White felt an odd
mix of emotions welling up in her. She was certainly
glad to be back home, of that there was no doubt, but
she would also miss the adventure.

&quot;I&#39;m glad I convinced you to clean up this morning,&quot;
Charming noted, her cloak and tunic nearly gleaming in
the afternoon sun.

Snow White adjusted her cloak, the heavy wool scrubbed
clean. Her chain mail was rolled up in a saddlebag and
she was wearing the same sort of red tunic and black
pants as when she left. Even her long black hair was
washed, though she had insisted on just tying it back,
as usual.

&quot;A waste of time,&quot; a faintly blushing Snow gently used
her heels to start Rosebud off as she said, &quot;let&#39;s get
going.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Charming gulped once then looked at Snow and
tentatively asked, &quot;are you sure your mother won&#39;t be
angry?&quot;

Without answering Snow firmly slapped the rump of
Charming&#39;s horse, sending him galloping down the hill
towards the castle and city as she growled, &quot;Get
moving!&quot;

Together the riders raced down the hill, slowing as
they reached the edge of the bustling city and the
paved streets. Familiar faces looked curiously at
Charming and nodded recognition to Snow as they went
about their business. Shops were open, carts hauled
food and people scurried about, all strangely apart
from the riders that made their way towards the castle
rising above the center of town.

&quot;The stables are over to the side,&quot; Snow said as the
crossed the moat and went through the castle&#39;s main
gates.

&quot;Snow!&quot; Jack called, the blonde haired nobleman racing
to her side, stepping warily around Rosebud. He smiled
as he saw charming, &quot;I see you found our wayward
prince.&quot;

&quot;Charming, meet Jack,&quot; Snow smiled wryly as they
climbed down, &quot;he&#39;s a bit of a pain in the ass, but a
good man.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Jack protested.

Charming smiled, offering her hand as she said, &quot;I
don&#39;t think I got to meet you earlier, sir, It&#39;s an
honor, giant killer.&quot;

Jack&#39;s smile was much more welcoming as he said,
&quot;Thank you, your own reputation proceeds you.&quot; He
looked over at Snow, &quot;You&#39;re mother is on the warpath
again.&quot;

Snow sighed softly even as Charming went pale and
asked, &quot;Why is she angry now?&quot;

Jack lead the two tired travelers inside, &quot;Not your
fault, thankfully. There&#39;s been a rash of monster
sightings out in the countryside, the queen may have
to send out troops....&quot; He trailed off when he saw the
looks on their faces, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I think at least some of it&#39;s been handled,&quot; Charming
explained, quietly filling him in on their last few
weeks adventures.

Jack chuckled softly as he tossed a impish look at
Snow, &quot;You know, I bet you&#39;ll be riding forth like
this again.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Snow raised a skeptical eyebrow.

&quot;Adventuring gets in your blood,&quot; Jack explained to
her just a bit regretfully as they reached the throne
room.

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Snow replied shortly as they went inside,
pausing only to order the guards not to announce them.
Together they moved through the courtiers waiting for
audience, conversations stilling as they passed until
they reached the front.

Rose Red spotted them first, her pale and melancholy
face lighting up into a radiant smile. &quot;My love!&quot; she
cried, racing to Charming&#39;s side and throwing her arms
around the other woman, the two holding each other
close in a romantic moment.

&quot;Well isn&#39;t that special,&quot; Jack commented dryly.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Snow hissed.

Charming&#39;s voice was quiet but Snow could still hear
as she murmured to Rose, &quot;I will never leave you
again, I swear it.&quot;

The Wicked Queen smiled wryly, sitting comfortably on
her throne as she watched the joyful reunion
thoughtfully. Her gaze moved over to Snow as she
approached the throne and she said warmly, &quot;Well done,
daughter.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Snow smiled as they watched the happy
couple murmur loving endearments to each other. &quot;We
have some things to talk about,&quot; she added, Snow
wondering how her mother was going to take knowing
Charming was a woman.

The black haired beauty on the throne smiled slightly,
eyes twinkling. &quot;Oh, I know Charming is a woman,&quot; the
Wicked Queen replied, &quot;you didn&#39;t notice at first?&quot;

Snow rolled her eyes, &quot;No.&quot;

Some weeks later, shortly after the joyous wedding of
the princesses Charming and Rose Red a low fog lay
over the kingdom. From a side gate of the castle a
figure rode forth, cloak flowing over her shoulders. A
fine suit of chain mail armor glowed, a sword strapped
to the one arm and a bastard sword swung over the
back.

The great stallion whinnied softly, a soft objection
from the back of his throat as they went over the
cobblestones towards the hills and what lay beyond.

&quot;Don&#39;t whine, Rosebud,&quot; Snow White said to him
impishly, &quot;if we didn&#39;t leave early there&#39;d be all
sorts of discussions.&quot;

Rosebud snorted, clearly indicating his feelings about
early rising.

They moved quietly through town, nodding greetings to
the few merchants that were just opening up. Out past
the town the road turned to rough dirt and with some
eagerness they hurried up the hill, only slowing to
take in the view.

Snow looked off in the distance, her eyes sparkling
with excitement as she softly murmured to herself,
&quot;Guess Jack was right.&quot; Gently she put her heels to
the stallion&#39;s sides as she murmured with a smile,
&quot;Let&#39;s go see what trouble we can get into.&quot;

The End

Notes: The opening lines for this story popped in my
head and I just HAD to write it. The leads are derived
from various fairy tales, inspired by various novels
and stories I&#39;ve read that have updated them in
various ways. A big influence was Bill Willingham&#39;s
Fables, a modern comic featuring the semi-immortal
fables living in modern New York. As far as
continuation requests go I&#39;m not promising anything,
but I am considering expanding on this in some way....</pre>
