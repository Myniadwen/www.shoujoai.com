<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch55.html">Back to Part 55</a><pre>Dying leaves circling Jessica&#39;s legs as she stood upon a set of wooden 
stairs, the object of her fear looming over here. Her old foster home 
seemed exactly as she left it all those years ago, its dark form towered 
over the girl making her feel small and helpless. She tried to push the 
feelings of fear aside, but found it just rose up with greater strength 
than ever before. Guilt swam laps in her stomach as years of memories 
began to unfold in her mind once again. She recalled the first day Penny 
and herself arrived at the foster home from the orphanage. She was only 
four years old back then and Penny merely three. She had thought this 
place would be their salvation back then and now she wished she had run 
away instead of opening those doors to hell. If only she didn&#39;t need to 
rely on others, if only she could have taken her sister in her hand and 
freed her from the nightmares that would be ahead. But she did not have 
the strength back then and now she had to face the consequences for 
fleeing in the end.

She rubbed at her head as memories of that last night spun about in her 
mind, she tried to take Penny with her, but the girl refused to go. She 
should have stayed herself, yet she could not face that place again. She 
ran for blocks that day just ran until her lungs hurt and her legs 
threatened to buckle from underneath herself. Once she had considered 
turning around, even glanced back to see if her sister was still waiting 
for her to return. The dark shadow of that house loomed in the distance, 
taunting her escape. If she turned back then she would never escape the 
madness so she decided right then and there that she would return 
someday to rescue Penny, rescue them all.  

Her eyes drifted over the house until they fell upon the corner bedroom, 
their dark curtains still blocked out all forms of light, locking away 
the dark secrets of this house from any prying eyes. A shudder filled 
her body as she remembered the tortures she suffered within the walls of 
that room, the acts she was force to do to her own little sister. A ball 
of disgust boiled up amongst the guilt and she dropped to her knees upon 
the hard wood patio. She really did plan to return, she did, and now 
that she had her chance she still felt weak against the overwhelming 
feeling the building stirred in her already fragile heart. She clenched 
at her chest as an unspeakable pain began to grow deep within her soul, 
and memories taunted her very existence. 

&quot;Why&#39;d I have to come back here?&quot; She asked the passing wind, &quot;Why?&quot; Hot 
tears brimmed at the edge of her eyes as she tried to rationalize with 
what brought her back to this place, the very place responsible for 
destroying her dreams of ever having a normal life. She clenched at her 
stomach in an attempt to keep it from tossing the remains of her food 
upon the patio floor and set her head upon the cold wooden boards. The 
mere presence of the house was making her ill and she could feel a 
hundred hands run over her flesh sending cold shivers through her spine. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She sobbed as she hit her head on the patio floor, &quot;I&#39;m 
soooo.. sorry...&quot; She punched her fist upon the boards in frustration. 
Tears streaking down her cheek, &quot;WHY!!!&quot; She demanded pounding hard 
enough to split the wood floor and lodge a few splinters of wood in the 
flesh of her hand, &quot;Why do I have to suffer over and over again? Why?!?&quot; 
She slammed her fist against the ground repeatedly, ignoring the pain 
that surged through her arm and the blood that dropped onto her 
overalls, &quot;IT ISN&#39;T FAIR!!!&quot; She screamed into the night, her voice 
drifting off into the darkness that surrounded the house.

&quot;I just want to be free of this place.&quot; She sobbed to no one, now 
cradling her wounded hand in her lap and glaring up at the house, &quot;I 
don&#39;t want to face it all again.&quot; She abruptly stood to her feet and 
pointed at the building with her blood soaked hand, &quot;I&#39;m over you!&quot; She 
cried out, &quot;You understand?!? I am through with you and your 
nightmares.&quot; She knew in her own heart that was a lie, but it felt good 
yelling it out. 

She considered turning around and leaving the building for good. It was 
not her fault Kima came to this place and it was not her job to bring 
her back either. She began to leave when her eyes fell upon the dim 
light of a small window with the silhouette of a small child sitting 
upon the sill. Something about this sight was familiar to her, &quot;A... 
amber...&quot; She muttered as she moved around the building to get a better 
look at the window. She suddenly recalled a young girl with curly orange 
hair who used to sit in a window just as this child was at that moment 
and warmth filled her heart at the memory of that girl. She recalled 
Amber&#39;s soft touch as the girl gently stroked Jessica&#39;s hair when the 
nightmares invaded her mind and the way the girl would sooth her mind 
during the darkest hours. All of a sudden she needed to see the girl 
again, needed to just set her eyes upon that girl one last time. She 
glanced around herself in search of someway to get the girl&#39;s attention, 
and then found a small pebble at the base of a tree. It was clich&eacute;, but 
maybe it would work, if only the girl heard her calls.
