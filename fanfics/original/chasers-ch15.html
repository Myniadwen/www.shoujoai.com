<a href="../original/chasers-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>        In the conference room they all sat around the long table, each 
reading their own copy of the analyst&#39;s set of latest reports. Beth 
frowned intently, Jen looked a bit worried, Gwen was her typical cool 
self, and Kate... she just looked grim.

        &quot;Are we sure these numbers accurate?&quot; Kate finally asked, 
setting the loose sheets down on the table. She was in one of her ragged 
old T-shirts again, the logo having faded away to the point of being 
utterly ureadable.

        Gwen nodded, &quot;Apparently so.&quot;

        Beth was flipping through the sheets, her own T-shirt so short 
as to reveal her belly button. She sighed as she read, &quot;Android logic 
breakdowns up over fifteen percent over last year, and increased 
disappearances of androids.&quot;

        &quot;Disappearance,&quot; Jen said wryly, &quot;usually meaning becoming 
freewill.&quot; The young woman was her usual prestine self, though her tie 
had bee loosened a bit.

        Kate looked over at Gwen, &quot;They&#39;re predicting an continued 
increase of android activity over the next few years based on the 
trends. You think they&#39;re right?&quot;

        Gwen nodded gravely, &quot;There&#39;s no way to be certain, but yes, I 
think so.&quot; The business suit clad woman flipped through the sheets, 
finding the page she wanted, &quot;What people forget is that more and more 
androids are built every year. The old ones get passed on to other 
owners, increasing the chance of a logic failure...&quot;

        Beth sighed again, putting her bare legs up on the table, &quot;Guess 
that means I&#39;d better be ready for more field duty.&quot;

        Jen quietly asked Gwen, &quot;Are we going to be recruiting more 
Chasers officers?&quot;

        &quot;Not currently,&quot; Gwen answered, getting out of her chair and 
stretching. &quot;No budget, and the brass want to see if the situation 
continues to worsen,&quot; she added tiredly.

        &quot;So we won&#39;t actually get any new patrol officers until we can 
prove that we&#39;re in dire need of them, huh?&quot; Kate said. She grimaced, 
flopping back in her seat dramatically as she muttered under her breath, 
&quot;Typical brass logic. Baka!&quot;

        Gwen raised her eyebrow, &quot;Was that directed at me, or the 
brass?&quot;

        &quot;The brass,&quot; Kate chuckled.

        &quot;Baka?&quot; Jen asked Beth quietly.

        &quot;Japanese insult,&quot; Beth whispered back, &quot;means fool or idiot.&quot;

        &quot;Cute,&quot; Jen smiled tiredly.

        &quot;Kawaii,&quot; Beth nodded with a smile. She looked over at Gwen and 
said, &quot;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ve got another piece of bad news to report.&quot;

        &quot;What is it?&quot; Gwen asked.

        &quot;You know that bulleten board system I hacked, the one that the 
freewills use to pass messages?&quot; Beth asked. At the general nods she 
said softly, &quot;It&#39;s gone.&quot;

        Kate sat back up at that, &quot;What do you mean, gone?&quot;

        &quot;You want me to spell it for you?&quot;Beth made a comic face. &quot;I 
mean, it&#39;s no longer where it was on the &#39;net, and I can&#39;t seem to find 
where it went,&quot; she explained.

        &quot;Which means what, exactly?&quot; Jen frowned.

        Beth sighed, &quot;Well, it could be that they figured out I hacked 
it. Or worse, they could be planning something big, so big they&#39;ve 
switched how they communicate.&quot;

        &quot;Let&#39;s not assume a conspiracy just yet,&quot; Gwen raised her hand. 
She looked over at Beth, &quot;You yourself said that you weren&#39;t sure they 
bought your cover story.&quot;

        For just a moment, Kate was tempted to mention her friend 
Silver, and suggest that she try to get some information out of her. But 
she really didn&#39;t know what might happen if she tried it... She looked 
over at Beth and said, &quot;I think you might just want to keep a eye out. 
If it turns up again, great, if not, we&#39;ll manage.&quot;

        &quot;I think she&#39;s right,&quot; Gwen nodded. She checked her watch, &quot;I 
need to meet with the brass soon, but first I want to speak to each of 
you alone in my office.&quot; She turned to leave but stopped at the door, 
&quot;Jen, you&#39;re first.&quot;

        Gwen sat behind the desk, pulling out the file for Jennifer 
Grayson. It only took a few moments before there was a firm knock on the 
door, and she called out, &quot;Come in.&quot;

        Jennifer came in quietly, standing at attention in front of the 
desk. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; she saluted. At Gwen&#39;s casual wave, she gracefully took a 
seat.

        Jennifer Grayson really was beautiful, Gwen noted, according to 
her file something that had been both a blessing and a curse. The blue 
eyed blonde had a worried smile on her face, and Gwen hastened to 
reassure her, &quot;I just wanted to let you know that I&#39;ve given you high 
marks on your preformance review.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Jen smiled in relief.

        Gwen hesitated, but felt obligated to say, &quot;You know, I&#39;ve 
gotten some inquiries from other police captains. It seems your 
preformance in the Chasers has impressed them a great deal.&quot; A smile, 
&quot;If you wanted to transfer, you could get almost any position you 
wanted...&quot;

        Jen shook her head firmly and said, &quot;I&#39;d like to stay here, 
ma&#39;am.&quot;

        Gwen smiled, feeling a bit of relief. &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; she smiled, 
then she said, &quot;Could you send in Beth, next?&quot;

        The knock this time was a bit more tentative, and Gwen had to 
work hard to keep herself from smiling. As she entered the green eyed 
redhead gave her a nervous little smile, and Gwen didn&#39;t rush to 
reassure Beth Harris.

        &quot;Why didn&#39;t you explain your modifications to the sensor grid?&quot; 
she asked Beth softly, her voice coming out as a dangerous purr.

        &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Beth said softly, &quot;I&#39;m usually the only one using 
the system, so it never really was an issue,&quot; she finished.

        &quot;You got lucky,&quot; Gwen gave her a withering look, &quot;that the woman 
didn&#39;t die because of her injuries before we could find her.&quot;

        A visibly pale Beth nodded, &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.&quot;

        &quot;Tomorrow you start briefing us all on your changes to the 
system,&quot; Gwe said, a bit more gently adding, &quot;you do good work, when you 
aren&#39;t tinkering excessively.&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Beth smiled weakly.

        &quot;Could you go tell Kate it&#39;s her turn?&quot; Gwen dismissed her. &#39;She 
really is good,&#39; Gwen thought as she watched her leave, &#39;Hope I wasn&#39;t 
too hard on her...&quot;

        There was a hard rap on the door, and then Kate Williams came 
inside without asking. The sandy brown haired woman was still damn thin, 
Gwen noted, but she looked quite a bit better than she had a few months 
ago, after poor Lynn died.

        &quot;Beth was sniffling a bit, when I passed her,&quot; Kate said 
quietly.

        Gwen sighed, &quot;Had to give her a bit of a lecture.&quot;

        &quot;Another reason I wouldn&#39;t want your job,&quot; Kate grinned.

        Gwen looked over at Kate curiously, &quot;What would you do if I 
promoted you without asking your permission first?&quot;

        The little smile Kate gave her in return wasn&#39;t very pleasant 
looking at all as she coldly said, &quot;Resign, probably.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s about what I figured,&quot; Gwen agreed. She smiled, &quot;Thank 
you, by the way, for keeping such a good eye on Jennifer.&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s good,&quot; Kate nodded, &quot;do you know if she&#39;s staying on?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Gwen smiled, &quot;she is.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;re lucky to have her,&quot; Kate agreed. She tilted her head 
sideways as she looked at Gwen curiously, &quot;So how many complaints did 
you get about me this time?&quot;

        &quot;Not so many this time,&quot; Gwen chuckled. At Kate&#39;s raised eyebrow 
she said, &quot;Well, there was that police officer you punched out, and that 
doctor you scared tried to file a complaint, but other than that, not 
much.&quot;

        &quot;I must be mellowing,&quot; Kate grinned.
