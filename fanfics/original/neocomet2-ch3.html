Prasutagus Manor, Greenwashe, Cath Maige Tuired

It did not take long to deliver Rhiannon and her troops to the place 
they would be spending the next three months before the sealing 
ceremony. Their station here was mainly for the protection of the 
ceremony, but they also had the task of protecting the magic-user who 
would be performing it. That was Bonnie Nakagawa-McAmish. A name that 
Rhiannon knew all too well. After the meeting with Prasutagus at 
Greenwashe Station, he guided the forces to his own private home where 
they would all be staying. It was a gigantic manor on the edge of the 
suburban Greenwashe Sector, more than enough in size to hold the twenty 
six troops sent from the Order of Light. It was also where Bonnie was 
staying. Likely enough, it made their jobs easier to have the girl 
there. 

Rhiannon and Prasutagus marched through the many green gardens of the 
richly decorated Manor, climbing up small marble steps and passing past 
stone water fountains. The troops all followed along until they reached 
the very front of the Manor. The two mighty doors at the head of the 
mansion opened up to reveal a short, aging butler, who nodded to 
Prasutagus as understanding for what was needed of him. The man servant 
bowed to the twenty-odd troops and led them inside the manor, towards 
their living quarters for the next three months. Now was a better time 
than ever to show them where they would be staying. Although the butler 
didn&#39;t much like the idea of cleaning up after twenty five burly men and 
women fighters for the next quarter of a year, he didn&#39;t have much of a 
choice in the matter either. 

Prasutagus have off a hearty laugh as Rhiannon&#39;s brave squad cheered at 
the sheer size of his Manor. &quot;Ha, ha, ha! They are certainly full of 
energy.&quot;  

Rhiannon crossed her arms as her soldiers were led inside. &quot;...I know my 
bunch may not be the most graceful, but they&#39;ll behave while they are 
here, sir. I assure you.&quot; 

&quot;No matter,&quot; He replied, &quot;Feel free to use my home as you would your 
own. After all, the lot of you may be needed to put your lives on the 
line to protect Miss Nakagawa-McAmish and the Quetzacoatl... the least I 
can do is show you the hospitality you deserve.&quot; 

Rhiannon then ran a slightly nervous hand through her orange-fire locks 
of hair. &quot;Speaking of Bonnie... just where is she? She is staying here 
with you, right?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right here!&quot;

A third voice called out to the pair of them as the doors to the manor 
began to close again. And Rhiannon couldn&#39;t say that she was unhappy to 
hear it. Both she and Prasutagus turned around when they heard the 
sweet, melodic and bouncy voice of Bonnie Nakagawa-McAmish. She stood 
behind the two swordfighters with a set of freshly cut flowers in one 
hand, and a pair of garden scissors in the other. It was obvious that 
she had been gardening. But one thing about Bonnie that made her special 
was that she looked gorgeous no matter what she was doing or what she 
was wearing. Even with those thick garden gloves on, she looked so good 
to Rhiannon. The normally flowing blonde hair tied upright and those 
thin reading glasses she wore almost sixty percent of the time did a lot 
to enhance the beauty of her. The youngest of the Highland women had 
almost forgotten that about Bonnie. And while Rhiannon just stood there 
with the most charmed and possessed of expressions, Bonnie was far less 
fixed. She quickly dropped the garden shears, the collection of hand 
picked roses and both of the thick garden gloves and dashed over to her 
girl. Bonnie giggled pleasantly the second she hurled herself into 
Rhiannon&#39;s arms. It had only been a month since they had last seen each 
other, but it didn&#39;t feel like that to either of them. 

&quot;Rhiannon!&quot; Bonnie put forth, &quot;I&#39;m so glad the Order sent you for the 
sealing ceremony! I was so worried they&#39;d send some weirdo-stranger or 
something. But its you! You&#39;re really here!&quot;

The Highland girl nodded. &quot;Yeah. I wasn&#39;t the first choice but I managed 
to pull some strings. Being a member of the Highland Family has more 
than a few benefits. At least that&#39;s what my grandmother would say.&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m so glad you&#39;re here,&quot; Bonnie whispered into her girlfriend&#39;s 
ear, &quot;And now that you&#39;ve been posted here for the next three months... 
we&#39;ll have so much time to spent together...&quot;

Though he had remained respectfully quiet through the more than 
revealing altercation between Bonnie and Rhiannon, Prasutagus couldn&#39;t 
help but cough into his fist to draw their attention to him. 

Both girls looked over to Prasutagus as he spoke. &quot;...I assume... that 
the two of you know each other, then?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~ 

Outer grasslands of Unterschleissheim, Neo-Germany

It was morning. 6.50. Just as the mission briefing had ordered, the 
small selection of troops from the Special Mission Corps had left. That 
was nearly two hours ago. The group had left Freiheit Palace and Munich, 
entering the surrounding fields of grass in between Munich and the town 
just a little ways north, Unterschleissheim. Just a little further on 
was Tuatha De Danann. The temple at which the four divine swords were 
entombed. The temple itself was named after the story-tale gods of 
Celtic fable, and had been hidden away in the grasslands. The journey 
there was not long, but considering how many people were walking the 
distance, it was taking more time than Saizaki would have wanted.

The troop moved through the grassy fields to Tuatha De Danann in a slow 
march. Everyone was fully armed, even though they did not expect any 
interference from the Covenant. At the head of the soldier group were 
Rainhande and Commander Aarin. Behind them were Saizaki and Lilia, with 
two others. The remaining soldiers were just a short distance behind 
them. As they walked, it was Lilia who was the least focussed. Mostly 
because she was admiring the beautiful sunny skies above. And it was a 
nice site. Sunny days were a rarity in what was left of Europe, all 
thanks to the Genesis Comet. That comet had effected more than just the 
population of the planet. It altered the climate and had destroyed much 
of the world, in various places that seemed somehow unconnected. The 
comet had actually landed in the arctic, but it was the shockwaves that 
ruined the world so badly. 

Places to the south and east of the globe were the least effected, so 
Australia and Antarctica came through most of the destruction with ease. 
It was places to the north and west that had suffered the most damage. 
What was once North America was now just a cluster of large islands. 
South America had been cut in half from its borders with Northern 
America, and the continent of Africa had more or less been completely 
submerged in water. The area which was once Africa was now an ocean 
called the Afro-Atlantic. Only one Safe-Zone existed there, and that was 
Neo-Malawi. Asia and Europe didn&#39;t suffer as badly, even though places 
such as Scotland, Scandinavia and the northern Russia had capsized into 
icy waters, England, Eastern Europe and the Middle East were much better 
off. Some parts of the world had suffered more than others, but all 
areas suffered somehow. Be it flooding, rampant disease or constant 
political unrest, no section of the Earth was completely free from the 
effects of the Genesis Comet. 

Which was why Lilia was so pleased to see a bright, sunny day. The 
climate of Europe tended to be very poor, with constant snow to the more 
northerly Safe-Zones, like Neo-England. Today was different, though. 
Which would make it easier for Lilia to work. Strange though it was, she 
had always considered a bright day a &#39;happy&#39; day. 

Saizaki too was in awe, but of the Safe-Zone barrier high in the sky, 
not the climate. The magical barriers surrounding the country were 
really something. It was an almost invisible force-shield, which allowed 
rain, snow and living people to pass through it, but blocked out the 
radiation of the outside world. This radiation was not poisonous and was 
concentrated mostly near the north arctic, but scientists of this era 
believed that the radiation would bring harm to people over time. The 
Safe-Zone barriers also protected its innards from the threat of 
shockwaves that passed over the planet every few weeks from the crater. 
They were like small tremors that passed through the air, but had the 
force of a strong gale wind. 

Saizaki thanked the gods that he was allowed entry into a Safe-Zone when 
Setsuya died. He spent his childhood in the outside world before he was 
adopted by his father, but Saizaki had hated it. Life on the outside 
world tended to be savage and undignified. Gangs and modern warlords 
ruled the outside world with an iron fist, because they were free of the 
diplomacy and laws of the World Federation. People lived in constant 
fear out there, due to the lack of rules, threats of violence, and the 
lack of uncontaminated water supplies. On the other hand, the outside 
world held much freedom. 

Things that were outlawed in Safe-Zones, like gambling, prostitution, 
non-army members carrying weapons, magic-use, etc; were accepted and 
embraced in the lands outside of Safe-Zones. An example of that would be 
the Island of Wraithmore (what is left of the former American state, 
Texas). It was known as &#39;the centre of forbidden pleasure&#39; because it 
had been the first to refuse to be accepted in the Safe-Zone Project. 
And thusly it was a Mecca for the sins and enjoyment that Safe-Zone 
dwellers lacked. Most of the American islands lacked Safe-Zones, but 
this was widely accepted by the remaining American people. Safe-Zones 
(to them, and to quite a few other nations left in the world) were too 
confining and law-sodden. It was a short life they were living, and so 
their motto was, enjoy it before you lost it. Saizaki understood and 
respected that. But even he was unsure of which form of life was better. 
Life within the security of the Safe-Zones, or the freedom of the 
regions outside them. It didn&#39;t much matter now. If the Order of Light 
were unsuccessful in their endeavours, then the Covenant of Sorcerers 
would win this war. They were the real issue.

Saizaki looked over at Lilia. &quot;You like the weather today, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Lilia replied. &quot;It&#39;s beautiful. So very beautiful... and so much 
more refreshing than the clouds we usually get in the skies of Europe. 
Neo-France definitely is the worst country in Eurasia when it comes to 
weather. I&#39;m glad Neo-Germany isn&#39;t as bad.&quot;

&quot;You should see Neo-England.&quot; Saizaki said as he and Lilia marched 
onwards. &quot;My Dad took me there once, to see Commander Highland. It snows 
all the time up there. In fact, the only time it doesn&#39;t snow is during 
this time of the year, the Summer. It&#39;s such a hard place to live. Maybe 
that&#39;s why the Covenant took control of it. Steal a country with a weak 
climate before moving onto the rest.&quot;

Lilia nodded. &quot;Probably. Which is why we have to fight hard. Maybe 
getting the four swords will help us to win this war.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot;

The baby blue eyes of the French girl turned downcast as Saizaki trailed 
off. &quot;What do you mean, Saizaki?&quot;

&quot;My Dad...&quot; Saizaki always spoke highly of Setsuya, &quot;Was one of the four 
people who got to use those swords. He had the flame one, the Fire 
Cutter... I think he called it. He said it was ruthlessly powerful. That 
if an evil man ever got a hold of one of them... the world would be at 
risk.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; Lilia was confused. &quot;The Order will have them. We will use them 
for the *right* reasons.&quot;

Saizaki shook his head. &quot;That&#39;s not it. My Dad was so dramatic about the 
swords, it&#39;s kinda hard to believe their so strong. I mean, come on. 
Even though they can give the user magical abilities, they are still 
just swords. How can four weapons change the course of a war this big? 
Just seems a little over-the-top to me.&quot;

&quot;I guess we&#39;ll find out if you&#39;re right or wrong.&quot; Lilia pointed 
forward. &quot;Look.&quot;

Saizaki followed Lilia&#39;s pointing gaze forwards. The troop had reached a 
small hill, covered in turf grass that was clearly artificial. Everyone 
stopped in their places as Aarin and Rainhande stopped, then all cast 
their eyes at the obstacle. Or what was behind it. Rainhande walked up 
to the tiny &#39;hill&#39; that was in his way. He looked over at it, then took 
his hand and rubbed on the front. What seemed to be grass was actually 
moss. And below that (now removed) moss was stone. The hill was in fact 
a rather large stone pedestal. And on that pedestal were the carved 
words, 

&#39;TUATHA DE DANANN&#39;

Rainhande (and the rest of the group) all looked up and marvelled as 
they were greeted with the great temple itself. The place at which the 
four divine swords were sealed, sixty years ago. It was larger than any 
of the group would have expected it to be. And it was, strangely, out in 
the open. No grass was tall enough to hide a building that size. 

Moss covered the building akin to the moss that covered the pedestal. 
Built of solid grey stone, and covered in the writings of an ancient 
Celtic language, this place was clearly aged. It was German in creation, 
and the Celtic religion didn&#39;t die out in Germany until the height of 
the Roman Empire was at its greatest. That meant this temple was 
thousands of years old. 

Rainhande was shocked that such an old structure as this was still 
standing. He was expecting the &#39;shrine&#39; to be a mausoleum or a tomb. &quot;To 
think, that an archaic structure like this could survive time, the 
Genesis Comet and the war... amazing.&quot;

Saizaki rolled his eyes. It was an old building to him, nothing more. 
&quot;So are we gonna get the four swords or what?&quot;

Then Aarin ran a hand through his long grey beard. This place was not 
exactly what he was expecting, either. &quot;I suppose this might be a little 
bit trickier than we would have-GAAAH!&quot;

There was no warning. One moment things were peaceful, the next an 
explosion was rocking the ground. Clumps of grass and soil were hurled 
into the air as the twenty-man troop of the Special Mission Corp all 
dove for cover. Saizaki grabbed Lilia and landed toward the ground to 
protect her from incoming fire. It was pure grassland out here, so there 
was no place to hide from the shots that were raining down from above. 
Saizaki looked up as best he could, surrounded by compact explosions and 
flying mounds of soil. White-hot bolts were fired at them. But these 
bolts were not created by guns or other forms of machinery. These were 
shots of magical energy.

Saizaki growled in irritation with Lilia in his arms. &quot;Dammit to hell! 
Magic-users!&quot;

&quot;Here? Now?&quot; Aarin looked over at Saizaki as he laid stomach-first on 
the ground. &quot;But how could they have possibly known about this place? 
Moreover, how did they breach the front line? Our armies have held them 
back right to the Neo-German border!&quot;

Lilia tried hard to speak. &quot;M-Maybe the front line was broken?&quot;

&quot;No...!&quot; Rainhande yelled, just to be heard over the explosions. &quot;There 
would have been many more soldiers if the front line had been broken 
through. And we would have been told by our front line troops days ago 
if they did!&quot;

Saizaki scowled. &quot;Who gives a damn? Lets just kill the bastards before 
they get their hands on the four swords! That&#39;s gonna be what they came 
for!&quot;

After a continual stream of energy bolts, the volley died down. The 
explosions ceased, and the troop was free to survey the damage. Out of 
the twenty men and women who had gone on this mission, eleven of them 
had been killed already. Their bodies were now in broken and bloody 
heaps, their limbs twisted into the dirt of the uprooted soil and plant 
life. The culprits were standing across from the living members. All 
dressed in black magician&#39;s robes, the haunting colours of black and 
silver. There was only ten of them, but their surprise attack had worked 
like a charm. Saizaki watched them all with anger. They had probably 
stopped firing because they thought everyone was dead. 

Aarin looked over at Rainhande, Saizaki and Lilia. &quot;You three! Go and 
retrieve the four swords! Quickly! We have no idea if there is anymore 
of the enemy in this location!&quot;

Rainhande nodded. &quot;Yes sir! Saizaki, Lilia! Follow me!&quot;

They waited for a brief second. A moment later, Rainhande jumped up and 
made a break for Tuatha De Danann. Saizaki unpeeled his hands from 
Lilia&#39;s body, then ran after Rainhande. Lilia soon followed, and the 
three soldiers dashed down towards the towering stone temple. Aarin 
watched them leave, then cast his eyes back over at the ten magic users. 
They must have guessed that not everyone had been killed because they 
started firing those magical energy bolts again.

The old sword master heaved himself to his feet and looked over at the 
enemy. His hand immediately went for the hilt of the sword that was 
strapped to his back, and drew his blade. It was a huge German 
Zweihander-type, four feet in length, called a Double Cleaver. It was 
large but with Aarin&#39;s phenomenal strength, he could handle it 
effortlessly. 

&quot;Come on, men!&quot; Aarin yelled to the remaining six soldiers. &quot;Charge!&quot;

As she dashed with Saizaki and Rainhande towards Tuatha De Danann, Lilia 
looked over her shoulder to see what was happening. Commander Highland 
and the other six left were now attacking the ten magic-users. She was 
sure that Aarin could handle himself out there, with or without the 
additional soldiers, but Lilia still did not like the idea of leaving 
him alone. Saizaki seemed to know what she was thinking, because he 
called out to her as they ran.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Lilia!&quot; Saizaki said in his light-footed stride, 
&quot;Commander Highland can whip those guys in no time! Just think about the 
swords!&quot;

Lilia nodded back in acceptance. They were the issue here. Saizaki, 
Rainhande and Lilia came to a quick stop as they were face to face with 
the door leading inwards. It was a large stone, carved rather expertly 
for something of this age. But it looked fairly heavy. 

&quot;We need to get past this door.&quot; Rainhande exclaimed. 

Saizaki gave an exhaling breath, then rolled up his sleeves, looking 
over at Rainhande. &quot;No kidding. Prepared to get your hands dirty, 
buttercup?&quot;

&quot;...Let us just be quick.&quot; Rainhande was not ignoring the disrespect 
that Saizaki was showing to him, even though he was a superior. But it 
didn&#39;t matter right now. They had to get to the four swords before the 
Covenant of Sorcerers did. Rainhande rolled up his sleeves in a similar 
way to Saizaki, and they both went up to the rectangle shaped rock that 
was blocking the door inside. They grunted in unison as they both 
pushed, from one side to the other. They managed to get it to move, but 
very slowly. 

Saizaki looked over at Lilia as they pushed. &quot;Lilia! Wanna give us a 
hand here?&quot;

The young girl nodded, then went over to the stone door, standing beside 
Rainhande. After a count of one, two and three, the soldiers all pitched 
in and pushed against the door with renewed efforts. The three of them 
all grunted and struggled as the stone door was inched from the right to 
the left. Slowly, ever slowly, until air began to seep into the small 
parting they had created. Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande all pushed hard, 
as hard as the possibly could, until a twenty inch gap had been created.

Saizaki took a moment to regain his stamina. &quot;Whoo... that should be 
enough, I think.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s keep moving.&quot; Rainhande said, as he slipped through the gap 
between the door and the doorway. Lilia did the same, her smaller frame 
passing through the gap with no effort or struggle. Saizaki followed her 
in kind, stepping through the parting into Tuatha De Danann. The three 
warriors all walked further inwards as they looked around the place. It 
was huge. It was one gigantic hall, 100 by 150 metres long. Many statues 
were around, mostly of ancient Celtic gods, but four of them took 
centre-stage. 

Four statures, each one shaped like angels or somewhat diving women, 
were standing at the middle of the room. And each of those statues had a 
sword between their own protracting hands. Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande 
all knew what those swords were. The four divine blades that had brought 
so much fear into the world. They had reached the four sacred swords.

Lilia was in awe of their gleam. This temple was old and covered with 
cobwebs, but the swords look brand new. As if they had been freshly 
drawn from chambers of the blacksmith. 

&quot;Are those... the swords?&quot; Lilia asked quietly.

Rainhande nodded. &quot;Yes. They have to be.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; Saizaki slapped his right fist into left hand. &quot;Then all we 
need to do is just grab them and go help Commander Aarin. C&#39;mon.&quot;

Saizaki, Lilia and Rainhande walked up to the four statues. Each soldier 
stepped up to a statue and took a hold of one of the swords. Lilia took 
the one furthest to the left, the Wind Soul. The blade that Aarin 
Highland had wielded. Rainhande took the sword furthest to the right, 
Lightning Tooth. The sword that Ingrid Highland had used. Saizaki was 
the last to pick one up. But as he did, he instinctively knew which one 
it was. The Fire Cutter. The sword his own father, Setsuya Seisuji, had 
held. Saizaki was immediately drawn to it. Not only to its holy 
beauty... but to its relentless power.

&quot;Man...&quot; Saizaki said, dumbstruck. &quot;I know this sounds weird... but I 
can *feel* the flames in this thing... what a radical weapon...&quot;

A forth voice came from behind the three warriors. &quot;That&#39;s too bad, 
muffin! Because you&#39;ll never get to see them again!&quot;

Saizaki, Rainhande and Lilia looked back behind themselves. A woman was 
standing at the doorway, which had now been opened all the way. Saizaki 
eyed her with confusion. He had no idea who she was. She wasn&#39;t a 
soldier. She couldn&#39;t have been. She wasn&#39;t even dressed like one. The 
woman was of medium height, dressed in a tight red Chinese dress, though 
she was clearly not of Chinese descent. She looked more American in 
origin. The bright jade hair was a bit of a catch too. It made Saizaki 
wonder what such a cute girl was doing here. But when Saizaki finally 
started to ignore her beauty, he saw the long wooden quarterstaff in her 
left hand. 

Rainhande was the first to address her. &quot;You there! Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Me?&quot; The woman smiled deviously. &quot;I&#39;m just a hot little number in 
search of a few swords. You can call me... Esperanza D&#39;Laine.&quot;

Saizaki grinned, pulling the Fire Cutter upright. &quot;That&#39;s a nice 
attitude. And I don&#39;t make a habit of denying cute women what they want. 
But we saw these toys first, you know? It wouldn&#39;t be very fair for us 
to just hand them over to you.&quot;

Esperanza was about to say something about that, until she took a closer 
look at Saizaki. The girl&#39;s bright brown eyes studied him intently, 
while the other just watched her. Seconds later, Esperanza was walking 
towards Saizaki. Rainhande and Lilia drew up their newly retrieved 
swords and prepared, but Esperanza just ignore them, focusing on 
Saizaki. 

In moment, Saizaki and Esperanza were face to face. &quot;Ooh!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Saizaki asked, blinking in confusion.

&quot;You are so totally hot!&quot; She said with lustful cheer. &quot;Ooh, I can just 
see you as my willing little plaything... all you need to do is hand me 
that &#39;lil swordie-sword...&quot;

Saizaki resumed his grin. &quot;Sorry, sweetie. The answer is no. Not while I 
.... oof!!&quot;

That moment, Saizaki doubled over, losing the breath that he had. 
Esperanza rammed the tip of her staff straight into the Japanese man&#39;s 
stomach, making him wheeze with loss of oxygen. The smile of the 
staff-girl faded into a frown.  

&quot;Wrong answer, Saizaki.&quot; She said, scowling. &quot;Nobody refuses me 
anything.&quot;

Lilia stepped closer to the older woman, Wind Soul at the ready. &quot;Hey 
you! Leave Saizaki alone! You better get away from him or I swear 
I&#39;ll...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll what...?&quot; Esperanza looked between Saizaki and Lilia, making 
some startlingly accurate assumptions. &quot;...So you think he&#39;s yours, do 
you? Hah! A little waif like you couldn&#39;t handle a real man! And though 
I wish I had time to show you this, I have an appointment to keep with 
an old dude you know as Al Gul Jehed.&quot;

Esperanza withdrew her staff from Saizaki&#39;s stomach, then vaulted up 
into the air. Lilia and Rainhande watched her flip through the air and 
land next to the statue that held the Shadow Edge. The sword that had 
once been in the grip of Zephaniah, master of the now-dissolved 
Shougatsu Financial group. Esperanza touched the sword gingerly, knowing 
full well that it was more volatile than its three counterparts. 

&quot;So much fuss over a piece of metal,&quot; The woman quipped. &quot;Men are so 
stupid.&quot;

Rainhande let anger reach him. &quot;Woman! Do not touch that sword! You 
serve under Al Gul Jehed, the leader of the Covenant of Sorcerers! That 
makes you my enemy! Turn away and leave if you wish to live!&quot;

Esperanza put the tips of her free hand to her face. &quot;Oh, you big 
meanie! You&#39;d really take that big ol&#39; swordie-sword and kill me? Okay 
then. Just let me wave my life goodbye...&quot;

A smile returned to Esperanza&#39;s face as she pulled her hand up into the 
air. Rainhande and Lilia just watched, while Saizaki was still 
struggling to get his breath back. The smile at Esperanza&#39;s face 
darkened, and in seconds, swung her hand down again. The girl screamed 
&#39;Shockwave!&#39; and huge distortion broke open in the air. Saizaki, Lilia 
and Rainhande were all knocked off their feet, instantly, and crashed 
into the dusty ground of Tuatha De Danann. Once all three were floored, 
Esperanza grabbed the Shadow Edge&#39;s hilt, her staff in the other hand.

&quot;So it worked.&quot; Esperanza claimed, surprise in her voice. &quot;Diana&#39;s spell 
gave actually give me temporary magical powers. Too bad it won&#39;t last 
very long. Oh well.&quot;

She then turned her gaze to Saizaki, who as still groaning. &quot;You still 
need some moulding, Saizaki. But I can understand. Being stuck around 
these royal losers all day can do that. I tell you what. Once you get 
your strength back, we could go on a little date! How about it?&quot;

Saizaki just managed to speak. &quot;...K-Keep dreaming... y-you floozy...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not nice, Saizaki!&quot; Esperanza scoffed. &quot;You really need a lesson 
in manners!  When next we meet, I expect a better attitude from you! 
Then I&#39;ll make YOU and the swords mine!&quot;

She then blew a kiss to her downed soldier. &quot;Toodles, muffin!&quot;  

Esperanza leisurely walked from the three soldiers, with the large 
Shadow Edge in hand. Once the echoing click of her boots ended, they 
knew that she was gone. Rainhande rolled to his side, with the Lightning 
Tooth in hand. 

Lilia also stirred, looking towards her team-mates. &quot;...Is everyone 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Uggghhh...&quot; Rainhande groaned again. &quot;I shall live. But that woman made 
off with the Shadow Edge...&quot;

Saizaki didn&#39;t move. He couldn&#39;t believe that he had just found his 
father&#39;s sword then had to deal with that crazy chick who acted like she 
was hot for him. And it was just now that Saizaki began to realize that 
Esperanza had somehow known his name. How was that even possible? He was 
sure he had never met with that girl before. But he tried not to think 
about it too hard. Even though this was supposed to be a retrieval 
mission... it culminated in his defeat. He had gotten a beatdown from 
some American chick. 

&quot;Damn...&quot; The Japanese man sighed.  &quot;...I could *really* use a smoke 
right about now.&quot;
