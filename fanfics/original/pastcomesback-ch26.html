<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 26 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>      Isaka let out a sigh of relief as she came before a door. Without hesitation, she 
kicked it down and was pleased to see a hallway. She peeked through each door, trying to 
find Krystal. Hopefully she&#39;d find her girlfriend before Tsuru...

      It was the third door on the right that finally yielded results. Krystal was lying on 
the bed, unconscious. Isaka rushed over and was immediately repelled. With a groan, she 
realized she ran right into a barrier. Was there some magical trick that those sisters 
couldn&#39;t do?

      The demon tapped it, watching the magic ripple. Maybe...

      Krystal awoke to a loud sound and soon realized where she was. She jumped off the bed 
with a start, seeing Isaka trying to tear through the barrier with dark energy. It wasn&#39;t 
working.

      &quot;Isaka! You&#39;re finally here,&quot; she said, coming close to her lover.

      &quot;Of course, sorry I took so long. They didn&#39;t do anything weird to you, did they?&quot;

      Krystal shook her head and put her hand against the barrier, right in front of 
Isaka&#39;s. &quot;I&#39;m fine. If we combine our power, we should be able to break this.&quot;

      With a grin, Isaka allowed dark energy to engulf her hand as Krystal&#39;s lit up with a 
bright light. Within seconds, the barrier shattered from the dual pressure, allowing Isaka 
to pull the blonde into a searing kiss.

      Their romantic moment was interrupted by a muffled scream from another part of the 
castle. Isaka looked over at the door, concerned. &quot;That... sounded like Tsuru,&quot; Krystal 
said.

      Without a moment to catch up, the couple rocketed down the hallway, Isaka pulling 
Krystal along by the hand. 

***** 

      &quot;Ew! What the hell are you doing?&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s here somewhere, I know it is...&quot;

      &quot;Seth, stop being such a creeper. Now is not a good time to get off!&quot;

      The young man shot the two teens a glare. &quot;Get off? Hey, I&#39;m not the one having a 
masturbation talk all the time.&quot; That shut them up.

      He had been reaching into the waistband of his jeans to find something important - not 
touch himself. Finally, Seth&#39;s hand close around the handle and he pulled out his pistol. 
How it had escaped him for a couple minutes in his jeans was beyond him...

      Seth flicked off the safety with a grin. &quot;I think I have a plan, ladies. The three of 
us are liability, as you can see by our group&#39;s defensive measures.&quot;

      As if hearing him, Bakra was flung back by a shadow beast and skidded to a stop next 
to them. He eyed the gun with suspicion as he got up. &quot;A gun? Seth, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s 
going to do any good against girls who can fry critters and mince them in a couple of 
minutes.&quot;

      Seth just checked the clip and scanned the area. &quot;I know. It brings back good memories 
of the first time I met Tycara...&quot;

      He found what he was looking for. &quot;Posh-Posh! Come over here!&quot;

      The snake that had been trailing his master now slithered underneath the current fight 
of Erin controlling her golem against a shadow beast. Sakura was over head, busy with her 
own monster while Abby tried to block seals with Tycara and Faye was setting her ribbons to 
work.

      Seth looked over at Eveon and Mina. &quot;You&#39;re right about us not winning, so I think we 
need the upper hand.&quot; He turned back to Bakra. &quot;I&#39;m going to distract them and you go in for 
the kill.&quot;

      The demon grinned at him and cracked his neck. &quot;Alright - just don&#39;t be a victim.&quot;

      Hina and Tsuki were innocently unaware of the plan forming as they continued their 
offense. It was rather easy, since they were using Carmilla for the hard hitting attacks. 
All they had to do was keep them on their toes.

      &quot;They&#39;re just no match for our teamwork,&quot; Tsuki commented, clipping one of Sakura&#39;s 
wings with dark energy.

      Hina was about to reply, but a loud song and a rush of wind caught her attention. She 
whirled around to see a bullet lodged in the wall behind her. She looked back to see Seth 
aiming at her and out of reaction got a knife ready to take him out.

      It was Tsuki&#39;s turn to be surprised when her little sister let out a loud squeal. 
&quot;It&#39;s in my shirt, Tsuki! It went down my shirt...!&quot; The brunette looked just in time to see 
Posh-Posh&#39;s tail as the snake slithered down deeper to bother the girl.

      Tsuki forgot what she was doing and Hina dropped her weapons. &quot;Let me get it, hold 
still!&quot; She began to open her sister&#39;s exorcist&#39;s robes and as she flung the snake away, she 
realized what was happening a little too late.

      They&#39;d dropped their guard in front of six opponents, while not skilled, still very 
dangerous. Tsuki fell into her sister as she barely avoided Bakra&#39;s slash. Erin took out the 
shadow beast with ease while Faye tied up and incapacitated Carmilla who was powerless 
without the sisters controlling her. Tsuki&#39;s real problem came in the form of blast of holy 
energy from Sakura and the blades from Abby.

      Tycara grinned as the swords made contact, blood spurting out. Sakura landed as the 
debris cleared while Abby sat on the ground, shaking. She hated fights - especially the ones 
where she didn&#39;t know what the hell she was doing.

      The first thing they heard was the pained gasp from Hina. The blonde girl was 
relatively unscathed, but only because she had been sheltered by Tsuki, now bloody and her 
back raw. &quot;Tsuki,&quot; she said. &quot;Tsuki!&quot; She started to shake her older sister fearfully as 
tears filled her eyes.

      &quot;Stop... Hina, that hurts,&quot; the brunette coughed out as her younger sister scanned the 
room, eyes wide. She was cradling Tsuki to her chest, obviously unsure as what to do. Bakra, 
with a long sigh, hoisted up his blade, ready to finish them off.

      Before he could strike, Faye interrupted. &quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Hina saw it as her chance and a 
burst of bright light filled the room as she carried her wounded sister off.

      When it cleared, the demon had a sour look on his face. &quot;What the hell was that for? 
They&#39;re dangerous!&quot;

      With a sigh, Faye leaned down to help the tied up Carmilla with her binding collar. &quot;I 
know... just... I couldn&#39;t read them before, but in that moment it was painfully obvious how 
much they love each other. I just couldn&#39;t let you do that, because...&quot;

      Faye stole a glance at Erin, who gave her an understanding nod. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Faye,&quot; 
Abby said. &quot;I&#39;m sure Bakra is only thinking of our safety, but I know me and Sakura held 
back because they&#39;re still children.&quot;

      There was a bit of silence as Seth came over to Carmilla. &quot;Here, I can get this off of 
her,&quot; he said, fiddling with it. The vampire had passed out by now, from her power being 
abused.

      Bakra sat down, still disgruntled, and settled for cleaning his sword.

      Eveon nearly jumped as she felt hands rub her shoulders affectionately. &quot;Sorry you had 
to come,&quot; Sakura told her quietly, but with a comforting smile.

      &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the blonde girl said, leaning into her. However, she became rigid once 
she noticed Mina glaring at her.

      Seth held up the collar with a smile. &quot;Alright, now that this is off her, we should 
find Isaka, Tsuru and Krystal.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;She went this way, so we should catch up to Tsuru soon,&quot; Isaka said to Krystal as 
they walked into the dark room. Krystal shuddered at the coldness and came closer to her 
lover. The demon draped an arm around her as they went deeper into the room.

      &quot;That dress is cute, but it&#39;s not very practical,&quot; Isaka commented with a grin.

      &quot;No, but it&#39;s quite beautiful,&quot; came a voice out of the darkness.

      Hoshi stepped out in front of them with a grin and said, &quot;Krystal, our master is 
waiting for you. It&#39;s quite rude to run off.&quot;

      The blonde shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m not going to be used as a vessel or some kind of... 
whatever it is, I don&#39;t want to be a part of it.&quot;

      The silver haired woman stepped aside. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s too bad. I&#39;m afraid you don&#39;t have 
a choice in the matter.&quot;

      Isaka stepped forward. &quot;Yeah, well I&#39;m going to kick your ass now-&quot;

      &quot;How about you fight me instead?&quot;

      A second voice rang out and this time it was Tsuru who came forward, a small smile on 
her face. &quot;We haven&#39;t done that in long time, Isaka.&quot;

      Hoshi laughed quietly to herself before giving the trio a slight bow. &quot;Please excuse 
me. I must go check up on my sisters.&quot; With that, she stepped back into the shadows without 
a trace.

      As Tsuru walked closer to the light, Isaka took a step back. Her friend was different 
now - her disheveled hair had gone back to its original black color and her eye patch and 
her swords were nowhere to be found. &quot;I don&#39;t want to fight you,&quot; Isaka said simply.

      Tsuru&#39;s smile grew. &quot;But I want to fight you. Unless you want me to tell Krystal the 
truth about how horrible you are.&quot; She looked over Isaka&#39;s shoulder at the blonde girl. &quot;You 
know, I lied to you that night, about how Isaka would stay with you-&quot;

      &quot;Shut up!&quot; Isaka shouted, walking forward. &quot;If you really want to pull this shit again 
then I will just pound you into the ground.&quot;

      Krystal watched her now black haired friend smile and dark energy build around her. 
Something was terribly wrong. &quot;Isaka, wait-!&quot;

      But her warning wasn&#39;t fast enough as a whorl of dark energy came spewing out of 
Tsuru&#39;s palm to knock Isaka back. The purple eyed demon fell to the ground with a thud, her 
body aching from the assault. Dark energy didn&#39;t normally harm her this way and Tsuru... how 
did Tsuru do that?

      She didn&#39;t have enough time to think as a boot pressed into her shoulder. &quot;So, how 
does it feel?&quot; Tsuru asked, not even trying to hide her pleasure at the demon&#39;s pain.

      &quot;What... what the hell? What are you doing, Tsuru-&quot;

      Tsuru pressed down harder, her dual colored eyes staring coldly at Isaka. &quot;I&#39;d like it 
if you&#39;d refer to me by my title now.&quot; She smiled and lifted up her foot. &quot;Lord of Demons.&quot;

      With that, she kicked Isaka across the room, the other woman not coming to a stop 
until she met the wall. &quot;Isaka!&quot; Krystal ran over to her lover, but Tsuru caught her by the 
wrist.

      &quot;Krystal, why are you going over there?&quot;

      &quot;Because you hurt her,&quot; the blonde said, trying to break out of her grip. &quot;Why are you 
doing this to her?&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t you get it? She&#39;s ruined everything for me... my family, my humanity, love... 
just everything. She killed the people who took care of me without a shred of remorse, she 
didn&#39;t mind turning me into something inhuman for a quick lay and then she took my feelings, 
my love for her, and used it. Used it to screw with me some more. How can you love a monster 
like that?&quot;

      Krystal shook her head. &quot;I know you&#39;ve been through a lot, but succumbing to darkness 
like this isn&#39;t the way. Revenge isn&#39;t going to help you!&quot;

      Tsuru let out a small sigh. &quot;I&#39;m not doing this for revenge. I could care less for 
Isaka... I&#39;m doing this for the power - the soul of the Demon Lord isn&#39;t sentient. His power 
can go on to any vessel capable of handling it and now I have it. I&#39;ve stood around long 
enough playing the nice friend,&quot; Tsuru said, watching Isaka get up from the ground. &quot;I&#39;ve 
always been the good little girl, playing my part like a puppet - whether it was killing 
demons or being Isaka&#39;s toy. I want something and I&#39;m just going to take it.&quot;

      &quot;What are you talking about...?&quot; Krystal asked, not liking the look she was getting 
from Tsuru.

      &quot;Hey, Isaka!&quot; The other woman called out to the injured demon. &quot;Do you want me to tell 
Krystal about all the things you&#39;ve done to your past girls? Or maybe about how much of a 
monster you really are?&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru...!&quot; she seethed, out shakily getting up on her feet. &quot;What are you doing?!&quot;

      &quot;Like I said, I don&#39;t give a damn about you. The only problem is that Krystal loves 
you,&quot; Tsuru murmured, turning back to the blonde girl. &quot;You deserve so much better than her, 
but it&#39;s alright. I&#39;ll make myself perfect - just for you.&quot;

      Krystal couldn&#39;t even respond as a pair of lips suddenly fell onto her own and a 
strong arm wrapped around her waist. Isaka could only gape as a hot rage filled her at the 
sight of Tsuru kissing Krystal. Her Krystal. The new Lord of Demons allowed her hand to 
tangle into Krystal&#39;s locks of blonde hair, forcing the girl to keep in the kiss.

      She let out a squeal as she tried to struggle, but soon stopped as she felt a deep 
coldness overtake her. Krystal let out a low moan as she became weak and tired. When Tsuru 
finally ended the kiss, the blonde collapsed against her, her knees giving out.

      Tsuru caught her seamlessly with a regretful smile. &quot;Sorry, Krystal. I know you must 
be tired now.&quot; She held the other girl against her and stared at her own palm. Holy energy 
began to gather around it and Isaka started to come forward.

      &quot;Tsuru, you little...! I&#39;m going to kill you - how dare you do that to my lover?!&quot;

      The black haired woman only let out a sigh and directed her palm at the demon. &quot;Don&#39;t 
talk of Krystal like she&#39;s an object. She doesn&#39;t belong to you, or to me. She&#39;s her own 
person... but I&#39;ll be sure to take very good care of her - something you can&#39;t do.&quot;

      &quot;What do you know? I love her more than anything-&quot;

      &quot;Just shut up,&quot; Tsuru said with a scowl. &quot;Nobody wants to hear your lies. Need I 
remind you of all the other girls?&quot;

      Isaka immediately froze up, her eyes going towards the worn out Krystal. Tsuru 
smirked. &quot;That&#39;s what I thought. But now, it&#39;s best that you die by the holy power I just 
devoured from your former lover.&quot;

      Without giving Isaka time to think, Tsuru shouted, &quot;Heaven Art: Divine Punishment!&quot; 
The demon caught eyes with Krystal one last time before the ground beneath her exploded in 
white light and several lances of holy energy pierced through the destruction.

      &quot;Isaka!&quot;

      Krystal&#39;s scream only reverberated throughout the room as Tsuru carried her away into 
the shadows - something that had seemed so comfortable when Isaka did it, but was now 
totally frightening.
