Slash Three: A Sanguine Day For Our Censure 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;What?!&quot;

It seemed like the angry decibels of Lord Satou&#39;s yells were becoming 
more and more commonplace these days. Defying the Shogunate was one 
thing. Dealing with villager resistance to your laws just added to the 
ire. Again he sat in his main hall, clutching angrily to his fan. While 
his retainers sat apart from him, mentally evaluating the anger of their 
daimyo. As usual Minagawa Ryouichi was none too far away from the lord, 
with his long and intimidating nodachi strapped to his waist Many of the 
retainers still bore him little in the way of good will. But they 
silenced themselves knowing his strength. In this day and age there were 
few masters of the nodachi left remaining in Nippon. They were 
exceedingly difficult to use, let alone master, for any normal man. The 
fact that this man Ryouichi was so proficient in the use of it, was 
frightening enough. It made Lord Satou&#39;s decision to employ such a 
devious looking man make more sense. 

However, right now, anger was all that was on Satou&#39;s mind. The daimyo 
looked forward to the bushi standing metres from him, giving report of 
the outcome of the soldiers he sent to vanquish the ronin that had 
shamed the Satou House. The adult-male bushi lowered his head and held 
himself in that position, feeling the dulling, thrashing anger of his 
master in its full force. 

&quot;It is true, milord,&quot; He said, &quot;the five samurai sent to stop the ronin 
were all defeated. One of them killed. The surviving four all took their 
lives out of respect for their failure. But the ronin is alive and 
well.&quot;

Lord Satou scowled at this. &quot;Damn them! Incompetent fools! Confound 
their ineptitude! Twice-over this ronin has disgraced me! Will those 
damn peasants have another figure to carelessly toss their idolatry to? 
No! I will not have it!&quot;

One of the retainers spoke. &quot;Perhaps sending more men into the village?&quot;

&quot;And waste more resources?&quot; Questioned Satou rhetorically, &quot;Absurd!&quot;

Then all of the retainers took note as Ryouichi, standing beside Satou, 
addressed the lord of Natsumura. &quot;If I may be so bold, milord, why 
bother to confront this man again? As you say, allowing more guards to 
be used against him would be a great waste. And if he were to die now, 
while the peasants clamour to his heels in worship, he would go down as 
a symbol of resistance that would be very unproductive Why not try a 
different approach?&quot;

&quot;...Such as?&quot;

&quot;Punish the many with the deeds of the few,&quot; Claimed Ryouichi, &quot;if that 
rebel bushi is problematic, then why not tax the filthy common people 
with the consequences? Enforce harder laws on the peasants from tomorrow 
forwards Make them know that they cannot go unaccountable for the crimes 
of their &#39;saviours&#39;.&quot;

The retainers all murmured to themselves in confusion and rumour. Was 
Ryouichi suggesting that they actually punish the townsfolk for the 
deeds of the ronin? It seemed a good idea to Lord Satou. He smiled at 
the idea, ruffling his moustache between his fingertips. Until one of 
the side-seated retainers addressed the floor. 

&quot;Please milord, if I may,&quot; He said, &quot;I do not believe that pressurising 
the peasants is a good idea. They are already overstretched with the 
work on the fields for the rice. If our plans are to be successful then 
we must remain outside of the Bakufu&#39;s attentions. Frustrating them 
before we sell the excess koku to the other han might cause them to send 
a kago-sho to Edo. Right now, the intentional persecution of the 
peasants seems... ill advised.&quot;

Ryouichi grinned rudely at the retainers. He knew of their hatred for 
him. Such a comment was a direct attack on Ryouichi&#39;s influence over the 
daimyo. But the hard-headed Lord Satou had already decided who would 
side with. &quot;No. Minagawa is correct. The poor must know their place. If 
I were to enforce harsher laws on Natsumura as a result of the ronin&#39;s 
interference, they would turn upon their hero. It&#39;s perfect! I will deal 
with this issue, by my hand the ronin will fall, and my plans for the 
eternal rule of the Satou House will come to light.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Dairyu Port.

For a second time since the arrival of Shinmyouji Hinata to Natsumura, 
night descended on the han. The stars and moon took place of the sun for 
another newly prolonged evening. The perfect cover of darkness for the 
dealings by which a small army would be armed. The beach of the port was 
a wide and sandy area. The peer itself, the wooden &#39;docks&#39; from which 
trade with other villagers took place Few of the ships remained here 
now. All had been sent out to gather goods from the north. They would 
return to the han soon, carrying all they had managed to gain in the 
bigger towns, in particular, Edo. All that could be seen on the water 
was a small incoming ship. Almost unnoticeable under the cover of 
darkness. 

Three samurai from Katsubana-jo stood watch around the port. They 
marched from point to point, inspecting the fish barrels and the crates 
to make sure nothing had been stolen. Thieves and brigands were more and 
more likely to steal from ports at night these days. Fewer eyes were 
there to pry, of course. Which was why Lord Satou had some of his men on 
watch. 

But there were others with plans tonight. 

Plans that involved that incoming ship. Behind the port of Dairyu and 
the beaches, were the bamboo forests that cut off Natsumura Village from 
the farming lands and the southern highway. Five speedy figures darted 
through the paths cleaved by the tall shoots of bamboo. All of them 
samurai. But moving with the grace of cats, dashing through the forest 
to reach the port in time. At the head of the group was the ronin rebel 
himself, Kagami Hayate. One of his hands was poised on the hilt of his 
katana, Gentatsu, as he ran. His eyes narrowed when the image of Dairyu 
Port became more visible between the bamboo. They were here. Hayate 
swiftly unsheathed Gentatsu and yelled a powerful battle cry, leaping 
out from the forests and into the clean night air. His fellow bushi 
followed him in the act, withdrawing their swords and jumping to the 
wooden floorboards of the port. The three castle samurai turned around 
quickly upon hearing battle cries. But under Hayate&#39;s command, they were 
already dead. The Ronin of the Wind rushed forwards at one of them, who 
was already fumbling to unsheathe. Before he had the chance, Hayate 
pulled Gentatsu up and then slashed downwards in a single stroke. In the 
blink of an eye, his sword cut through the shoulder, chest and ribs of 
the castle bushi in a quarter moon slash. Blood splattered everywhere, 
spilling onto the wet, seaweed-smelling floorboards of the port. And the 
corpse of the soldier toppled into two finely cut portions The remaining 
two were unable to avenge the death of their compatriot in battle with 
Hayate. By that time they both had their hands full with the Wind 
Samurai&#39;s followers. Two of Hayate&#39;s men battled the other guards. And 
seconds later, they also were chopped down. Hayate took a cloth from his 
pocket and wiped Gentatsu of the blood, then sheathed the sword. While 
his troops now dragged the corpses of the three defeated guards to 
somewhere secluded. 

While they did that, Hayate looked out into the sea. The ship was almost 
at port. They had gotten here just in time for its arrival. &quot;Alright. 
They&#39;ve come on time, and so have I. The wind has been good to us 
tonight.&quot;

One of Hayate&#39;s followers, a younger man by the name of Kubo Masahito, 
sheathed his bloody blade and walked up to his leader, looking out unto 
the sea &quot;So the boat from Deshima Port is almost here. Perfect. I think 
we can start the rebellion even sooner than we planned, sir.&quot;

&quot;You can be sure of it, Masahito,&quot; Said Hayate, &quot;Satou&#39;s rule must come 
to an end now. I just hope that sister of yours can control herself this 
time.&quot;

Masahito smiled. &quot;Hiroko is... difficult. But she&#39;ll be an invaluable 
aid in the siege. Her skills with the Naginata are quite exceptional. 
Plus, she has my father&#39;s fire in her. Far more so than I do.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope so.&quot;

The two of them came to quiet and waited for the ship to dock. The three 
other warriors under Hayate&#39;s command disrobed the corpses of the dead 
guards from Satou&#39;s little castle of Katsubana-jo. Then hurled their 
bodies into individual buckets of sake. Such a thing would quench the 
stink of decomposition. Hayate&#39;s men then rolled those barrels out into 
the beach, and from then on into the sea. Wherever they ended up, it was 
better than at Dairyu Port. They then set about wiping up the blood they 
had spilt to make sure that no one caught on to the murders By the time 
they had finished doing those jobs, the boat was already docking. 
Masahito and Hayate watched as the ship&#39;s bridge line came down to the 
wooden surface of the port. Southern bushi, at least thirty of them, 
came pouring out of the ship, two by two, each of them carrying a heavy 
wooden box. At the head of the group was a woman. A tall, strident 
female, dressed a white half kimono and a red hakama, with a taped-up 
Naginata strapped to her back. 

That woman, happened to be known as Kubo Hiroko. 

The proud woman pressed her hand into her hip and marched forwards with 
her men behind her. The first two dropped one of the boxes before the 
feet of Hayate and Masahito, grunting.

While Hiroko said, &quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again, Kagami. You too, 
brother&quot;

Masahito bowed politely while Hayate crossed his arms, smirking. &quot;You 
seem to be in a good mood. From the letter you had smuggled to me, I 
would have thought that you&#39;d have thrown another fit in coming here.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so moronic,&quot; Normally most of Hayate&#39;s followers would have 
been quite a bit more respectful to him, but Hiroko was a rare exception 
to that rule. There were reasons for that. But for now... &quot;It took all 
that we had to get these past Deshima security. Those Dutch sailors 
might not be small in stature, but there&#39;s little they could do against 
the bushi the Bakufu have stationed there.&quot;

&quot;So how is it that *you* succeeded?&quot; Questioned Hayate.

Hiroko smirked. &quot;Too many men make the mistake of underestimating a 
woman.&quot;

Hayate had seen that before. The hey-haired man chuckled, then kneeled 
down to the floor His hands clutched at the lid of the wooden case at 
his feet. He opened the box and peered inside. Inside the case were 
three stacked Tanegashima matchlocks, freshly imported from the south. 
While the vast majority of firearm weapons available to Nippon were 
outdated, as were these; the expense of the rifles was minimal. Which 
meant they could buy many of them. And all of Hiroko&#39;s men were 
experienced in the handling of guns. With this force at their hands, 
taking over Katsubana-jo would be so much easier. 

&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Hayate expressed, &quot;gormless weapons though they are, we can 
put down Satou once and for all with these.&quot;

Hiroko ignored Hayate&#39;s wonder and looked around. &quot;Hmph. I never for one 
second thought that I&#39;d be back here again. But since my brother 
requested my help, I couldn&#39;t really refuse you. But these men of mine 
do not come cheap, Hayate. They&#39;ll expect at least three koku each as 
soon as the takeover is complete.&quot;

&quot;They will have it,&quot; Hayate affirmed, reattaching the lid, &quot;the Lord has 
made an over-excess of rice for the past three years. You&#39;ll have all 
that you want. For now we just need to concentrate on finishing our 
mission.&quot;

While Hiroko, Hayate and Masahito conversed and the other men offloaded 
the cargo of rifles to the port, a shadow had descended on Dairyu from 
moments ago. A deadly woman shadow named Asakura Riki. The young shinobi 
spy from Edo leaned behind one of the wooden pillars that held up the 
port surface, covered in salty seaweed from the high tide. She had heard 
everything. And seen the fate to befall the three guards. Over to her 
left, the sake barrels with their corpses were floating in the nearby 
coastal water. A great many things were taking place in Natsumura...

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Mused Riki, &quot;...I think I may have my hands full here...&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The air between Hinata and Nanase was deathly quiet. There was much that 
they had to speak of. Yet they were unwilling to say these things to 
each other. Nanase was consumed with many things before Hinata&#39;s 
arrival. Income worries, fears for her brother, the fate of her family. 
Happiness was a rare occurrence then. But since Hinata had graced the 
village of Natsumura with her presence, things were looking up for the 
mild mannered Nanase. She had been born knowing that she was a bastard 
bloodline originating from nobility. Nanase had clawed her way by, 
thinking that peasantry was her only means of survival in the real 
world. Then came this glorious image of a woman. Shinmyouji Hinata. A 
woman who bared the daisho without any internal/external fear or 
embarrassment. A woman who defeated men twice her size without ever 
turning a breath out of place. A woman who proved herself to be a 
phenomenal warrior, as strong as any male, but yet maintaining her 
youthful beauty all at the same time. Nanase was dumbstruck to meet such 
a woman in this day and age. And when Hinata had opted to stay in 
Natsumura Village after the attack by the kunoichi Asakura Riki, Nanase 
was, in truth, pleased. She was happy that such a visionary woman would 
stay with her for a bit longer. Finally she could stop worrying about 
her brother and the scrapes he was getting himself into. Finally she 
could rest easy knowing that there was someone strong enough to protect 
her in these desperate times, willingly or not.

And yet...

...something was off.

Even now, Hinata and Nanase sat together in the living area of Nanase 
and Takahiro&#39;s home, by the middle table. As they sat, the two of them 
ate from individual bowls of rice, chewing and eating in silence. 
Nanase, every now and again, would look up from her bowl and steal 
glimpses of the beautiful bushi of the Ennoichi Clan. When she did, 
blushes came to her cheeks. Not to mention a fluttering in her stomach. 
Something had changed for Nanase. She felt... drawn to Hinata now. Not 
just to her image as a swordswoman or as a fellow descendant of 
nobility, but as a woman. These all new feelings made her feel somewhat 
uncomfortable around Hinata. As if saying something would betray what 
she was experiencing to public knowledge. And yet being away from Hinata 
for even a short period of time was becoming murder. Nanase was so 
unsure of herself. Or how she should be handling this.

Moments after Nanase tried to ponder what she should be doing about all 
of this, Hinata finished her rice, and placed the bowl down on the table 
a second afterwards. &quot;Nanase.&quot;

The girl gasped when she was addressed. &quot;...Y-yes?&quot;

&quot;If having me here is inconveniencing you,&quot; She began, &quot;I&#39;ll leave. I 
know that your brother doesn&#39;t think too highly of me anyway It would be 
no trouble to find accommodation by the afternoon.&quot;

To be perfectly honest, Nanase wasn&#39;t even expecting a comment like that 
one. And through the whole time that Hinata spoke, she could do nothing 
but stare longingly into the Shinmyouji-girl&#39;s eyes. It was only when 
Hinata spoke the word &#39;leave&#39; that Nanase started to pay attention to 
what was being said. The Natsumura villager shook her head to break her 
reverie, stating,

&quot;No, please don&#39;t.&quot;

Hinata stared silently and emotionlessly at Nanase for a while. Which 
was when the younger girl decided she should express herself a little 
better than that. &quot;...I don&#39;t... I don&#39;t want you to go, Miss 
Shinmyouji... please stay.&quot;

&quot;...Thank you.&quot; Hinata said. She then pressed her hands against her 
knees and stood upright, bearing both her weapons and her full dress 
code. 

Nanase looked up as Hinata arose. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;

And Hinata didn&#39;t seem to be able to detect the desperation in that last 
little piece of dialogue from her friend. &quot;I met a man on the night I 
went searching for Takahiro. He gave me a sort of proposal and I have 
yet to answer him. So I think it&#39;s about time I gave him my reply. I&#39;ll 
be back soon, alright?&quot;

Nanase nodded slowly and watched Hinata walk to the paper frame door. 
She slid it open and walked out into the village road, closing it behind 
her. The younger villager sighed tiredly and lowered her head. Nanase 
was no stranger to her own sexuality Though she kept it hidden for 
years, even from her own brother, she knew that her preference was for 
females. Yet this thing she was feeling for Hinata was so much more 
complicated than usual. The samurai girl was so... closed-hearted and 
cold. Though not rudely so. Even so... it presented many a difficulty to 
Nanase. 

What could she do... to open Hinata&#39;s heart to her?

Those thoughts were far from Hinata&#39;s mind. The young samurai stepped 
out into the village road. It was morning. By now the women of the local 
were up and ready for a day of cookery, cleaning and food shopping. 
While the men were preparing to head out to the fields to farm. But as 
Hinata left Nanase&#39;s house, she noticed that there were fewer people 
walking towards the town centre than usual Then she looked to her far 
right. A large number of people, at least 70 of them, had gathered 
around a newly erected wooden platform. On that platform were two castle 
bushi from Katsubana-jo. And they were guarding a long piece of paper, 
1x25 metres long, hanging off a wooden pole. On that large roll of paper 
was an edict One that Hinata could not see from where she was standing. 
But it seemed to be causing quite a stir in the townsfolk. They all 
gassed to each other with whispers and light yells at what they were 
seeing. Men and women alike. Hinata turned around and walked up to the 
crowds surrounding the declaration. Once she got to the back of the 
group she was able to see what it stated. And it was the following;

&quot;New Laws to be hereafter levied in the Natsumura domain by order of its 
current Lord, Satou Genpachiro.

1). A curfew is now in effect. All travellers, courtesans, merchants and 
peasants alike must be within the precinct of their homes by nightfall. 
If anyone is seen to be out of doors at night and does not provide a 
good explanation of the reason, they shall be arrested. 

2). Trading with other villagers in or out of the han is strictly 
forbidden without written permission of Lord Satou. Anyone who 
contradicts this rule will be arrested

3). A &#39;public efficiency&#39; tax has now been sanctioned on all merchants A 
sum equal to 2.5% of an estimated annual income in ryo will be paid 
directly to Katsubana-jo every two weeks from this day onward. If anyone 
of said class breaks this rule the head of their family shall be 
arrested. 

4). Finally, leaving Natsumura is now strictly forbidden. Anyone 
attempting to leave the domain, regardless of station, will be killed on 
the spot.&quot;

The group of villagers gathered around the sight of the edict were 
clearly outraged at these new laws. But the presence of the castle 
samurai, even though there were only two of them, kept them from 
demonstrating their anger. Hinata sighed, closing her eyes and turning 
around. Lord Satou was even more unreasonable than Hayate had suggested. 
Though Hinata had no proof of it, she was sure that his passing of these 
new laws was an indirect attack on her. Which made it all the more 
important that she give Hayate her answer. As Hinata turned away from 
the group and strode down the residential road to get to Hayate&#39;s 
hideout, her mind began to drift. Thinking back to times when life was 
so very different for her. Back to her younger times on Akaitaiyo-shima.

Back to her times with Mitomi Kanae.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;No, Miss Asuka! You must separate a fist&#39;s worth of space between your 
hands while holding a blade! Channel even MORE power into your sword!&quot;

Hinata, her brow dripping with sweat, her breathing rapid and her 
heartbeat quickening, stood poised. Within her hands was her training 
weapon. Her Bokuto. She wouldn&#39;t be presented with steel swords until 
her graduation as Master Genryu&#39;s pupil. And he was a tough taskmaster 
in anyone&#39;s case. The man himself stood apart from Hinata, across that 
expansive space of grass that covered the surface of the cliffs 
overhanging the beaches of the island. In the distance, on the sea, 
small trade ships were heading for the Ryukyu islands for trade and 
sale. There was a very rare form of herb that grew on Akaitaiyo-shima. 
It sold well on open markets as a spice for cooking. But no one knew 
just where those herbs originated from.

Still, that wasn&#39;t important to Hinata at this point. The young woman 
caught her breath and looked over at her tall swordmaster, Genryu 
Syobashiro. His muscled body gleamed in the sun from a sweaty build-up. 
But his breathing was fully under control. Unlike Hinata&#39;s. The girl 
focused her power into her blade just as Genryu had instructed, pulling 
it into the air. 

&quot;Alright,&quot; Genryu said, whilst watching the young woman make the 
necessary adjustments to her stance, &quot;come at me!&quot;

She then charged as him as quickly as she could, maintaining the stance. 
Genryu exhaled and waited for the incoming strike with his own Bokuto 
held before him in a horizontal stance. Hinata cried out once reaching 
strike-range, swinging her sword downwardly Genryu growled with 
ferocious zeal and swung his Bokuto around to counter the blow. Two 
light but thick rods of wood clattered against each other. The hollow 
echo ringing out across the short cliffs. But the force generated 
between the clash was far stronger than that bang indicated. So proven 
when Hinata was thrown back from the strength of the altercation. The 
girl gasped and fell hard to ground, dropping her Bokuto from her hands. 
Laid-out, the intended future leader of the Ennoichi Clan breathed in as 
best she could, wiping the sweat from her brow and forehead. Genryu 
chuckled and leaned over his student, giving his calloused hand to her. 
Hinata pulled a smile and grabbed that hand, allowing him to help her 
back up to her feet. 

Once Hinata was standing, Genryu said, &quot;You are becoming stronger day by 
day, Miss Asuka. Though you aren&#39;t quite at the level of myself or your 
mother yet... I can see great things for you.&quot;

&quot;Then why do I keep losing?&quot; Hinata asked, out of breath. 

Genryu crossed his arms with a smirk. &quot;You made one fundamental error. 
And I call it fundamental because every female swordfighter of the 
Ennoichi Clan must come to terms with it at some point. Just as your 
mother did when I trained her.&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Think of a gate,&quot; Genryu suggested, &quot;tall and unmoving. To simply force 
your way ahead is impossible. You cannot break through it. Because its 
strength goes past your own. What must be done to proceed is to find a 
way around the gate. When force meets force, it is the stronger one that 
will inevitably prevail. You must find a means of bypassing strength as 
an asset to win.&quot;

&quot;I think I get it now,&quot; Hinata commented, &quot;the reason I keep losing, is 
because I keep charging you face-to-face. As a man, you are stronger 
than me. So you will always win in a test of strength. What you&#39;re 
saying is that I must discover a way to go beyond your strength using 
the talents I have., in compensation for my lack of comparative 
strength, is that it?&quot;

Genryu nodded. &quot;Correct. One day you may be forced to fight an opponent 
who is stronger than yourself. Do not challenge them in their field of 
expertise. That will always give them an edge. Face them on your own 
terms. Use your speed and agility as a woman to your own advantage. But 
the way by which you do that... you will have to discover that for 
yourself.&quot;

A third voice then spoke to the pair of them. &quot;But yet that doesn&#39;t 
necessarily mean that she has to figure it out today, does it, Master 
Genryu?&quot;

Both Hinata and Genryu looked over to the right. The woman behind the 
voice made herself seen. In all her glory. Mitomi Kanae. As usual, when 
seeing her, Hinata went red in the face. Her heartbeat, already fast 
thanks to her training with her swordmaster, increased. She was looking 
forward to the rest of her lessons. But only because they were being 
taught by Kanae herself. 

Genryu paused, then addressed the woman. &quot;Miss Mitomi? Is it time 
already?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; She said in that melodic voice, &quot;I can&#39;t have you wearing out my 
pupil before the rest of her lessons, now can I?&quot;

The old master Genryu chuckled, running a hand through his long grey 
beard. He did enjoy training new students. Sometimes his training 
overlapped Kanae&#39;s teaching time. But his first and foremost concern was 
for the preparation of Hinata as leader of the clan upon the death of 
her mother. Genryu took Hinata&#39;s Bokuto with his own and nodded over to 
her. &quot;You should run along now, Miss Asuka. We will continue our lessons 
tomorrow.&quot;

Hinata bowed politely to her master and skipped off in the direction of 
Mitomi Kanae. Genryu smiled at his pupil and let the two of them head 
off back to the village of the island. Kanae and Hinata walked onto the 
dirt path that led down to the settlement, going to continue what they 
had been studying yesterday. Until Kanae noticed the heavy breathing and 
sweat upon her student.

&quot;Asuka,&quot; She said, &quot;are you tired?&quot;

The younger woman gave her teacher a tired smile. &quot;A little.&quot;

&quot;That Genryu. He&#39;s such an overabundant man. I think you need a little 
rest before we pick up from where we left off. Follow me.&quot;

It was a reflex action to the command &#39;follow me&#39;, but Hinata reached 
her hand out and held Kanae&#39;s. So quickly that neither of them noticed 
it immediately. The future leader melted inside from feeling the 
exquisite softness of Kanae&#39;s pale skin, but noted how sudden an action 
it was for her. Just as Hinata nervously tried to pull away, Kanae held 
her hand firm, and interlocked their fingers to seal their holding of 
each other. Hinata didn&#39;t dare look into Kanae&#39;s eyes, fearing her 
reaction, but her heart throbbed none the less, just happy to be close 
to the woman she knew herself to be falling in love with. Kanae, with 
that playfully elegant spirit, giggled lightly and led Hinata off. The 
pair of them walked off the dirt road and turned northwest, up the rise 
of the hill. Which brought them to a secluded part of the island.

The small bamboo forest. 

Before long, Hinata and Kanae were surrounded by tall shoots of bamboo 
that rose into the air above them. It was a moderately dense field of 
bamboo for them to be navigating their way through, but a few of the 
farmhands had chopped down a path for people to walk through a couple 
years prior. That pathway still maintained today. Kanae and Hinata 
walked through the bamboo forest, hand in hand, admiring the beauty of 
the sunbeams peering through the gaps of the dense forest edge. They 
continued walking until they reached its centre. When they came across a 
stone erection in the very heart of the location. A flat basin with a 
rising flow of water from which a person could drink. It was also cooler 
in here than it was outside, a sensation provided by the shade of the 
bamboo. 

Kanae uncurled her fingers from Hinata&#39;s. The girl gave a silent sigh 
but didn&#39;t begrudge the lack of contact between them for long. Hinata 
strode up to the water fountain-like production and kneeled down. Then 
cupped some of the water into her hands and drank from them. She 
quenched her thirst and then splashed her face to rinse off the sweat. 

Kanae smiled and watched this. &quot;I could tell you needed that. I should 
ask Genryu to take things easier on you.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t,&quot; Hinata asked, lifting her head from the bowl, &quot;I know it 
might be hard for me now... but I have to be strong For my mother&#39;s 
wishes.&quot;

&quot;But does that make you happy?&quot; 

Normally a question like that would have been beyond Kanae&#39;s station, if 
the caste system of the mainland had any bearing on Akaitaiyo-shima. But 
Hinata didn&#39;t mind. Kanae knew her better than anyone else. It was as 
plain as day to her 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a fighter,&quot; Hinata admitted, &quot;I want a peaceful life 
where I can be content with writing my poetry and practicing my koto. I 
want to spend my life admiring the beauties of the world that you&#39;ve 
shown to me since you became my teacher. Is that so wrong?&quot;

&quot;...No.&quot; Kanae seemed to sense how important of an issue this was to her 
pupil. She opened her arms to Hinata in that moment, just in a caring 
light, Hinata instantly embraced her, wrapping her arms around Kanae&#39;s 
thin body. Kanae enfolded her pupil summarily, running her long fingers 
through Hinata&#39;s (at that point) shoulder-length brown hair, &quot;it&#39;s not 
wrong, Hinata. We are women, after all. Throughout the history of Nippon 
we have been no more than caterers to the wills of the men we are 
supposed to love I suspect that it is the same for women everywhere 
else, too. There are some of us who want more. Some of us who want to be 
on the same level as men. To wield swords and to fight for or against 
the Tokugawa&#39;s well kept peace. You are unique in that you were born in 
a place that would allow such a thing. But that does not mean your heart 
desires the same as those others. Whether it contradicts our rightful 
aspirations or not, there are some of us who do not wish to spill blood. 
There is no shame in admitting that, Asuka. But you have an obligation 
to the clan. To protect and uphold it. I know that you don&#39;t wish to 
fight... so try to resolve your problems without violence. Learn to 
master the sword but also learn the skills of diplomacy necessary to 
make use of it the last resort. It&#39;s a hard compromise, I know, but it&#39;s 
perhaps one that might bring you... happiness.&quot;

Hinata sighed, her head snuggled peaceful at Kanae&#39;s chest. &quot;You always 
know what to say, Kanae. I-I don&#39;t know what I do without you.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Kanae claimed, stroking Hinata&#39;s hair, &quot;I love you very much.&quot;

Hinata&#39;s jewel-purple eyes opened. The word &#39;love&#39; had escaped the lips 
of the only person she had cared for - romantically - in her life.

Love

But it wasn&#39;t the kind of love that Hinata wanted.

She wanted so much more...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

By the time Hinata&#39;s memories of her past ended, she found herself 
standing on the long dirt track that led to Hayate&#39;s hideout. She had 
been here only once before but she remembered it quiet clearly. The 
Shinmyouji-girl exhaled and shook off her tiredness, walking forwards. 
In minutes she passed by the small mansion-like home that contained 
Hayate and his small band of insurrectionists.

Hinata marched up to the frontal entrance of the abode. Two men, 
unarmed, were on guard of it. They took a look at Hinata, knowing who 
she was, then opened the sliding door for her. It seemed that pending 
her decision, Hayate had ordered his men to show her the utmost respect. 
Which was good, because it showed the devotion of his men to his cause. 
Most of the fellow bushi at Hayate&#39;s command condemned the prospect of a 
female samurai just as easily as Takahiro did. But they all put that on 
hold for Hinata at Hayate&#39;s behest. The plum-eyed girl walked through 
the small wooden corridors of the hideout until she came to that central 
hall she had spoken to Hayate in beforehand. She slid open the door and 
walked inside, to see Hayate and three others. One of them was, of 
course, Takahiro. Another two were ones that Hinata did not know of. A 
young swordsman (Masahito) and a tall woman with a taped Naginata 
strapped to her back (Hiroko). 

Hayate smiled when he looked to his opened door. &quot;Ah, Hinata. It&#39;s nice 
to see you again.&quot;

Hinata nodded to him in respect. &quot;It is nice to see you again as well. I 
assume you&#39;ve heard about Satou&#39;s new laws?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Hayate said, &quot;the whole town is buzzing about it. It does 
present a few problems of mobility with my men but we&#39;ll find a way 
around it. So, have you come to decision about my offer?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hinata said with a nod, &quot;the answer is no.&quot;

Hayate&#39;s smile fell. &quot;No? But what about Takahiro&#39;s sister?&quot;

There was eye-contact made between Takahiro and Hinata but neither of 
them addressed each other. &quot;I have decided to stay in Natsumura, 
regardless of the new laws. If Nanase really will be in danger thanks to 
my actions then I will be the one to amend it with my protection of her. 
She has shown me much kindness since my arrival. I owe her that much.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Hayate couldn&#39;t say that he wasn&#39;t disappointed by that, but, it 
was Hinata&#39;s decision, &quot;very well. We could have used someone of your 
talents but it&#39;s your choice. Thank you for taking the time to consider 
my offer.&quot;

Hinata nodded, bowing to the young man. Right before she turned and 
exited the door. She hated to disappointed people, ever since her old 
days on Akaitaiyo-shima, but she couldn&#39;t join in this rebellion. Once 
she left, Hayate, Takahiro, Hiroko and Masahito resumed the planning for 
their assault upon Katsubana-jo. They sat in a ring, surrounding a paper 
map of Natsumura. Hayate pointed his finger to a certain point on the 
map, saying,

&quot;Since that bastard Satou has banned travel into and out of Natsumura, 
our troops are going to have to come here in secret. Takahiro. You will 
meet up with the recruits from Higo at the northern end of Shirokawa 
Pass tomorrow at daybreak.&quot;

Takahiro nodded in conformation of that, and Hayate dragged his finger 
south on the map. &quot;Masahito and I will wait at the south-western fork of 
Shirokawa Pass for the recruits from the Satsuma domain. While Hiroko 
and her squad will prepare themselves here for the attack. Takahiro&#39;s 
troops, my troops and Hiroko&#39;s team will gather at Ichigateki Shrine 
just twenty minutes walk from Katsubana-jo by mid-afternoon. By 
nightfall, we&#39;ll arm up and position ourselves for the attack. Hiroko&#39;s 
team will pick off the wall guards and the frontal guards of the castle 
at first. Then Takahiro&#39;s team will advance through the rear gates under 
cover of arrow fire. Once the major forces of Katsubana-jo are mobilized 
against that team, my group will pour directly into the front gates and 
attack in a two-pronged assault. Then I&#39;ll advance with my forces to the 
keep. Which is where we&#39;ll meet Satou. And it is where Satou will meet 
his end.&quot;

Hiroko held a hand to her chin. &quot;It all sounds simple enough. But how 
many men does Satou have at Katsubana-jo?&quot;

&quot;Only 300,&quot; Takahiro added, &quot;but he&#39;ll call for more if we don&#39;t bring 
him down quickly enough.&quot;

&quot;Then I suppose we have no choice.&quot; Masahito said. 

&quot;Right,&quot; Agreed Hayate, &quot;this is it. There&#39;s no turning back.&quot;
