<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>      Eveon sighed as she walked down the sidewalk. It was time to go home now that the 
field trip was done. The bus was just around the corner, but her major cause of depression 
was the lack of Mina&#39;s presence. She swore the teachers were afraid of them doing something 
naughty at the museum sleepover... they just had to go and separate them into different 
groups!

      Determined to stay in a bitter mood until she saw her girlfriend, Eveon almost didn&#39;t 
notice the flower shop right next to her. She still had fifteen minutes until she had to be 
at the bus and... All the flowers were so beautiful! Like a kid in a candy store, she stared 
at all the different plants, thinking. She had money on her and she hadn&#39;t seen Mina all day 
so.

      With a shy smile on her face, Eveon decided to play hopeless romantic and get flowers. 
She heard the bell on the door jingle a she walked in. There was no one there. The blonde 
girl looked around, hoping to see something interesting by the time the owner decided to 
show up.

      &quot;What can I get you?&quot; Eveon almost jumped at the sound of a voice and turned around to 
see that the owner had just come out of the back room. She had a mischievous face, though 
she was wearing a simple smile now, with sparkling teal eyes. Eveon found that quite odd, 
but then again, her eyes were purple so she shouldn&#39;t be one to talk, eh?

      The owner stepped behind the counter and Eveon found it quite strange that she was 
wearing a hat on her head. The young girl could see her red hair underneath and tendrils of 
it had come loose from the hat, as if wanting to defy her wishes. Her hair was an 
interesting shade of red, but Eveon decided not to ask about it.

      &quot;Oh, I&#39;m looking for some flowers,&quot; The clerk just gave her an &#39;oh-really?&#39; look. 
&quot;Alright, who&#39;re they for and what&#39;re they like?&quot;

      Eveon just flushed. &quot;Ah, well, they&#39;re for a girl, but I&#39;m not sure what to get 
her...&quot;

      The older woman just laughed. &quot;Of course it&#39;s for a girl! Unless you&#39;re saving your 
older brother from embarrassment because he forgot his girlfriend&#39;s birthday,&quot; She gave 
Eveon a scrutinizing look. &quot;But that&#39;s not it, is it? You&#39;re acting far too strange for this 
to be a detached purchase of flowers.&quot;

      Eveon fidgeted under her intense stare. The woman&#39;s eyes seem to glint strangely 
before her mouth upturned in the most knowing and mischievous smile Eveon had ever seen.

      &quot;You&#39;re in love, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Eveon tried not to gape. &quot;Don&#39;t try to hide it; I&#39;m 
really good at seeing these kinds of things... I rarely ever encounter someone so young and 
already in love, how magnificent!&quot;

      Eveon said nothing. She was pretty sure that her mom was the only weird one, but...

      It was then that the owner gave her another knowing look. &quot;You&#39;re definitely not 
buying these for a boy, so...&quot; She giggled to herself and stepped out from behind the 
counter. &quot;What&#39;s your girlfriend&#39;s favorite color?&quot;

      Eveon stared in disbelief. &quot;Wha-? How did you know...?&quot;

      The older woman just gave her a pat on the head. &quot;I have my ways... It&#39;s so 
fascinating that you&#39;ve found true love already, how did I not notice it before?&quot; She let 
out a dreamy sigh.

      &quot;Umm... her favorite color, is... blue...&quot; Eveon murmured awkwardly, ready to leave 
the store with the crazy clerk.

      &quot;Okay, how about some special blue lilies? They&#39;re quite beautiful and not found 
often!&quot; The older woman started to make a bouquet, not even waiting to hear Eveon&#39;s 
response. &quot;Plus, nothing like overt symbolism to show your girlfriend how much you love 
her!&quot;

      Eveon just laughed nervously and Faye continued to arrange the flowers. &quot;Man, you&#39;re 
so lucky. Here I am, at the young age of 20 without anyone... and there you are with the 
love of your life at only... what? Are you 16? 15?&quot;

      After wrapping a red ribbon around the plastic, she handed the flowers over to Eveon. 
&quot;No charge; it pleases me to see people who&#39;re in love.&quot;

      Eveon looked down at the bouquet and back up at the woman. &quot;Are you serious? But I&#39;ll 
feel bad...&quot;

      The woman just smiled and shrugged. &quot;Whatever. Just imagine how happy she&#39;ll be when 
she sees them...&quot; She let out a sigh. &quot;How wonderful...&quot;

      Eveon wasn&#39;t sure what was up with this crazy lady, especially when her eyes sparkled 
in that strange way again. Silence passed between them.

      &quot;Well, you should probably get going. You don&#39;t want to keep her waiting, Eveon.&quot;

      With that, the younger girl was practically pushed out of the store before she could 
protest getting free flowers. It was only when Eveon was a few feet from the bus that she 
stopped to wonder how the store clerk had known her name. However, she completely forgot 
about it when a pair of lithe arms captured her waist from behind.

      &quot;Ohhhh! I missed you so much, Eveon...&quot; The blonde girl could feel Mina&#39;s breath 
against her cheek and she tried not to giggle so much. &quot;I missed you too...&quot;

      Mina let go and her blue eyes widened tremendously at the sight of the flowers in 
Eveon&#39;s hands. &quot;Eveon! You... you&#39;re so sweet...&quot;

      Mina leaned in to give Eveon a nice warm kiss and the blonde girl relented. Eveon was 
smiling to herself, now extremely happy that she had stopped to get those flowers. 
Unfortunately, as Mina&#39;s hands slipped under her shirt, the two of them forgot that they 
were making out in front of a bus filled with their peers.

      Thus, their make out session was stopped thanks to their homeroom teacher clearing his 
throat. &quot;I... believe you two should be on the bus right now, instead of making a scene.&quot;

      The two girls blushed and said, &quot;Sorry,&quot; before getting on board. As they walked past 
the teacher, he whispered to Mina, &quot;Save it for the back row.&quot;

      The ebony haired beauty just flashed him a knowing grin and Eveon felt a shiver go 
down her back as she saw the entire back part of the bus was empty. Strange... As Mina laid 
the flowers down on one of the seats and pushed her up against the window, Eveon had to 
wonder if Mina had some supernatural ability to make situations like that happen.

      Of course, all her thoughts dissolved into nothingness as her girlfriend kissed her 
with much eagerness. &quot;You know,&quot; Mina murmured between kisses, &quot;I think I owe you now... 
seeing as how you got me flowers and I got you nothing...&quot; Eveon shook her head and nuzzled 
into Mina&#39;s neck.

      &quot;Nah... it&#39;s not about the objects, but about the feelings.&quot;

      Mina leaned forward and kissed her delicately. &quot;I love you, Eveon...&quot; The blonde girl 
smiled. &quot;I know. I love you too, Mina.&quot;

      They were so wrapped up in each other, that they didn&#39;t notice their teacher scolding 
some of the kids on the bus. &quot;I swear, if another one of you turns around in your seat-!&quot; 

***** 

      As much as she wished she wasn&#39;t, Faye was depressed. The strange teal eyed, red 
haired woman who owned the flower shop slumped down in the chair next to the cash register. 
To many, she was just the 20 year old store owner who always had an odd habit of tucking her 
hair underneath a cap or a bandanna or some other stylish head hiding device.

      Right now, she was extremely jealous of the girl she&#39;d just given flowers to. &quot;Lucky 
little lesbian,&quot; she murmured under her breath. Here she was, in all her single glory and 
then a girl comes waltzing in, already in love. In. LOVE.

      Faye cursed her luck. Of course, she was extremely happy for Eveon (how she knew the 
blonde&#39;s name was her little secret) but at the same time she was insanely jealous that she 
didn&#39;t have somebody to love. And she owned a fricking flower shop. Faye started playing 
with a tendril of her hair, wondering if she&#39;d ever see Eveon again.

      That made her kind of sad. She loved seeing people in love because seeing people in 
love kept her hope alive. She tried not giggle at how strange it sounded in her head. 
Instead, Faye looked up at the ceiling.

      &quot;I was on top of the world once... so why? Why has it come to this?&quot; Of course, her 
ceiling fan could provide no answers for the sad red head. &quot;One day... I&#39;m going to find you 
again,&quot; Faye murmured. Unfortunately, her reverie was interrupted thanks to the middle aged 
man who came busting through her doors with much gusto.

      &quot;I need a special flower!&quot; he said between pants of breath. &quot;My last chance flower!&quot; 
Faye had a feeling that this was not going to end well... 

***** 

      &quot;So, why are you coming straight to my house?&quot; Mina looked up from the flowers when 
Eveon asked her question. The couple was currently walking down the sidewalk, hand in hand, 
Mina still mesmerized by the lilies.

      &quot;Oh, my parents had to go somewhere this weekend and they figured it would be better 
if I stayed with you and your mom for awhile,&quot; Mina then gave Eveon a huge smile, &quot;They also 
said that us being under Abby&#39;s watchful eye would be better than you climbing up a tree at 
night and them having to listen to the door to make sure you aren&#39;t &#39;acting like a guy&#39;.&quot;

      Eveon flushed at Mina&#39;s long winded response. &quot;How does everyone know I sneak into 
your room?!&quot;

      Her girlfriend shrugged. &quot;I dunno. Remember that one time you came across the lawn and 
the sprinklers went off?&quot; Eveon turned bright red, obviously remembering that scenario from 
a few months back. &quot;It was too bad you didn&#39;t wear a white shirt that night.&quot;

      Eveon just pouted. &quot;Uh huh. You still managed to convince me to let you towel dry me 
in my undergarments, remember?&quot; The blonde paused. &quot;Do your parents seriously listen to the 
door whenever I come over?&quot;

      Mina just laughed. &quot;I know! I keep wondering when they&#39;ll figure that you&#39;re the 
bottom and I&#39;m the top...&quot;

      Eveon still wasn&#39;t sure if it was because she was slightly taller than Mina or more 
tomboyish, but the Lamets seemed to assume that she was the dominant one... oh how wrong 
they were. &quot;I just hope they come in on one of the nights where you try to trick me into 
playing dress up...&quot;

      Mina gave her a small peck on the cheek. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just because that can&#39;t hear your 
beautiful cries when I shove you into the closet.&quot;

      The blonde girl bit her bottom lip. &quot;Sometimes you scare me. If we were Krystal and 
Isaka&#39;s ages...&quot; Eveon tried to cover her red face at the thought of all the things they 
would be doing to express their love for one another.

      &quot;When we&#39;re old enough... I promise you won&#39;t be scared,&quot; Mina said, stopping to look 
into Eveon&#39;s eyes. &quot;When we decide that the moment is right... when it&#39;s perfect... we won&#39;t 
worry about silly things like that.&quot;

      Eveon couldn&#39;t help but melt at Mina&#39;s words. They started walking again, with their 
finger intertwined.

      &quot;Hey, Mina?&quot;

      &quot;Hmm?&quot;

      &quot;...How often do you think Isaka and Krystal... you know...?&quot;

      &quot;I bet all the time. You know Isaka... she&#39;s probably got Krystal bending to her will 
right now.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Krys-tal!&quot;

      &quot;Isaka... not right now.&quot;

      Just how the Lamets were completely wrong with the dynamics of their daughter&#39;s 
lesbian relationship, Eveon and Mina were off about who was in charge when it came to the 
exorcist and the demon.

      Speaking of which, Krystal was currently trying to keep Isaka from engaging in sexual 
activities with her. It was at the point where the demon just wanted some attention... just 
a little kiss here or a touch there... or... or...

      Krystal looked up from the book she was studying to see those pitiful purple eyes 
trained on her. She wasn&#39;t exactly sure what was up with Isaka. After Abby had interrupted 
their special time, Krystal had been intent on studying on gods and goddesses. Good for 
Erin, bad for deprived Isaka.

      The exorcist did feel bad for her demon, but...

      &quot;Isaka, sometimes I feel like you only want me for the... the sex.&quot;

      If she was a dog, Isaka was quite sure her ears would have pricked up at that. Krystal 
was sitting at the desk and Isaka was lounging on the bed.

      &quot;What? No, it&#39;s not like that!&quot;

      Krystal turned around in the chair to look at her. &quot;It feels like that... I mean, 
you&#39;re not as bad as some guys I knew, but even Seth wasn&#39;t like this.&quot; The demon&#39;s eyes 
visibly widened.

      &quot;No, I want it because I love you so much, not because I&#39;m depraved... if I was, I 
would have just attacked some poor girl off the street!&quot; Isaka wasn&#39;t sure where this was 
coming from, but she was starting to wonder if maybe she&#39;d pushed a little too far.

      &quot;Really? It just seems like every other moment you want to screw me instead of 
spending time together,&quot; Krystal tentatively bit the tip of her finger. &quot;To be honest, I 
only really like you when you&#39;re vulnerable...&quot;

      An awkward silence passed between them. Isaka wasn&#39;t sure what to say. Did she really 
make Krystal that uncomfortable? She wanted to think of something comforting to say or at 
least some way to defend herself, but... Vulnerable? Isaka wasn&#39;t sure what that meant.
