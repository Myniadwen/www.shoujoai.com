<h1>Exile's Road (part 16 of 18)</h1>

<a href="../original/exileroad-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>The guild hall of the Genin assassins was dark, the
shadows reflecting the men and women gathered there.
This place wasn&#146;t accessible from the streets of the
city, and the route was protected by many deadly
traps. Only those who were of their unique number
could safely find this place, hidden from the eyes and
ears of the people of the city above them.

The leader of the Genin sat at the head of the square
table, his eyes cool pools of shadow like the dark
clothes he wore. &quot;And what of the Duchess?&quot; he asked,
the pale skinned man&#146;s voice flowing like poisoned
honey.

&quot;With Lord Darthan&#146;s death,&quot; his lieutenant spoke up,
the brown haired young man looking oddly like some
secretary, &quot;the contract has not been renewed. We also
took a final attempt on her last evening...&quot;

&quot;How many men?&quot; the leader asked curiously.

&quot;A dozen of us,&quot; a younger man reported, &quot;a mix of
younger recruits and more experienced assassins.&quot;
There was a longer pause and he continued, &quot;I must
reluctantly report that they were all defeated.&quot;

There was a ripple of surprise amid the men and women
sitting around the table as they reacted to that
surprising news. A young man spoke up, his voice
mostly amused as he said dryly, &quot;I&#146;m really not
surprised.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; their leader looked at the foreigner curiously.
A younger man he came from Edo and their home Guild
hall, and he had originally feared the boy was here to
replace him. Yet the smooth featured young man had
always been respectful, knowing his place in their
ranks and never seeming to strive for more.

&quot;When I crossed blades with Midori I could tell she
had faced our kind before,&quot; he smiled a bit grimly,
&quot;she comes from Edo, like our guild itself.&quot;

&quot;And she carries a royal blade?&quot; a dusky skinned woman
from the south asked.

&quot;By the watermark and the swordcrafter&#146;s mark,&quot; he
replied, &quot;the sword was one of the ones crafted for
the old rulers of Edo, gone nearly a decade now.&quot;

&quot;So, is she their lost princess Midoroshi?&quot; their
leader wondered, &quot;Or just one of the several
pretenders that have appeared over the years.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s interesting that she&#146;s here,&quot; the lieutenant
noted thoughtfully, &quot;all of the pretenders rose up in
Edo, seeking to use the name for their own power.
Whoever this woman is, she seems uninterested in power
or nobility.&quot;

&quot;Do we still have a contact with Edo&#146;s Shogun?&quot; their
leader mused aloud.

&quot;I think Lord Musashi is still in favor with the
court,&quot; a young woman noted, her brown eyes amused,
&quot;and we&#146;ve done business with him in the past.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#146;s send him a message,&quot; their leader nearly
purred, &quot;I think the Shogun would be very interested
in hearing where their lost princess is.&quot;

Meanwhile, in the audience chamber of the palace
Commander Hudson warily kept an eye out as the Queen
completed her announcement. &quot;And in closing,&quot; Queen
Gewn said, &quot;I will urge the guild council to recognize
the Guild of Gentlewomen.&quot;

The rumblings of discontent from the lords were
obvious, though clearly no one was going to say
anything publically. Then there was a loud thump, and
all eyes fell to the hiresword Midori, who swept the
crowd with her eyes. &quot;The queen has spoken,&quot; she said
dangerously, &quot;and if anyone has a problem with that,
they are welcome to take it up with me.&quot;

The room became much quieter after that, everyone
having heard of Midori&#146;s deadly reputation. &#145;Days like
this,&#146; Hudson mused, &#145;I&#146;m very glad I hired her.&#146;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Queen Gwen smiled with glee shining in
her eyes. Getting her amusement under control she
addressed the crowd, &quot;Are there any petitions today?&quot;

&#145;Somehow, I doubt anyone&#146;s going to risk it today,&#146;
Hudson silently mused. After a few moments the
audience ended, and the Queen and a few others
gathered for a meeting in the Queen&#146;s private
chambers.

&quot;So,&quot; Queen Gwen said, the slim blonde relaxing in a
chair in her tower sitting room, &quot;you think that was
the last of the Genin?&quot;

The Duchess Jantha and her cousin sat on the couch,
her own blonde hair glittering. &quot;That&#146;s what I&#146;m
wondering,&quot; she conceded.

&quot;Midori?&quot; Hudson asked, the older man deferring to the
foreign woman&#146;s superior knowledge of their foes.

Midori gave him a flat look, her eyes narrowed just a
bit in irritation. &quot;If that wasn&#146;t their last gasp it
was close,&quot; she conceded, &quot;they wouldn&#146;t send such
numbers out normally.&quot;

&quot;That had better have been the end of it,&quot; Laur&#146;ien
noted, the tawny haired woman cleaning her nails with
one of her many fearsome knives, &quot;I almost thought
they were going to break through that time.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#146;t that close, was it?&quot; Queen Gwen looked a
bit alarmed.

&quot;Six to one odds, even though I helped stop one or
two,&quot; Jantha said wryly, &quot;it was very, very close that
time.&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Midori nodded, &quot;but we got a bit lucky that
they weren&#146;t trained in fighting as a group. They
might have broken through otherwise.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to tell your bard friend Nathaniel about
it,&quot; Richard said, the white haired viceroy looking
amused, &quot;it&#146;ll make a terrific few verses for his
Ballad of Magnificent Midori.&quot;

&quot;Do it and die, m&#146;lord,&quot; Midori warned jokingly.

&quot;I think you&#146;re stuck being famous, my friend,&quot;
Laur&#146;ien snickered softly.

&quot;Hmph,&quot; Midori sat back with a scowl.

&quot;However, I think I&#146;d like you to continue to guard
Jantha,&quot; Hudson said after a moment.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jantha didn&#146;t quite manage to hide her relief.

Hudson drank a bit from a tankard one of the maids had
delivered. &quot;Someone of Jantha&#146;s importance needs a
bodyguard,&quot; he shrugged as he addressed Midori, &quot;and I
find I like having you on the payroll.&quot;

&quot;Especially after you quieted the grumbling today,&quot;
Gwen noted, merriment dancing in her eyes, &quot;thank
you.&quot;

Midori looked away, a faint blush coloring her cheeks.
&quot;In my land, you&#146;d have had a champion to do the
same,&quot; she explained, &quot;I just did what I thought was
fitting.&quot;

&quot;Queen&#146;s Champion,&quot; Gwen tilted her head to the side,
&quot;I like the sound of that.&quot;

&quot;It does sound like a good idea,&quot; Richard confessed,
taking a sip of his wine.

Gwen looked over at Jantha, &quot;I don&#146;t suppose I could
borrow Midori for the job?&quot;

Jantha frowned slightly, &quot;I don&#146;t think so.&quot;

&quot;Too bad,&quot; Gwen pouted.

Midori rolled her eyes, &quot;You can have Laur&#146;ien if you
like.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Laur&#146;ien protested.

&quot;Sorry, I&#146;m leaving her with Jantha too,&quot; Hudson cut
in, &quot;if only because they keep her out of trouble.&quot;

&quot;I get no respect,&quot; Laur&#146;ien sighed.

&quot;If you like,&quot; Hudson politely offered to his queen,
&quot;I can have a few candidates name&#146;s sent over for you
to review.&quot;

&quot;It&#146;s something to consider,&quot; Gwen agreed.

Hudson took another drink, careful not to let his
sympathy show. &#145;What she really wants,&#146; he mused a bit
sadly, &#145;is a connection like the one that seems to
have formed between Jantha and Midori. Too bad such a
thing is so rare and precious...&#146;

&quot;Speaking of a champion,&quot; Richard said, &quot;do you really
think it was wise to make that announcement now,
Gwen?&quot;

&quot;It may not have been wise,&quot; Gwen conceded, &quot;but
there&#146;s likely to be no better time than now,
especially with the rumblings in the nobility.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Richard sighed.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Jantha offered with a slight smile, &quot;I
suspect the noblewomen may well help solve that little
problem.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Gwen asked.

&quot;How many lords are going to continue to oppose you,&quot;
Jantha looked amused, &quot;once their wives tell them they
won&#146;t get their bed privileges back till they stop?&quot;

Richard looked at her in surprise then he broke into
laughter. &quot;Now that&#146;s just fighting dirty,&quot; he
chortled softly.</pre>
