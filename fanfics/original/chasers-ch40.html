<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 40 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/chasers-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>Beth Harris frowned as she worked, compiling the
various files then sorting it into a series of
documents detailing the computer problems. Her report
itself was simple: headquarters&#39; system was a mess,
the security systems so badly employed to allow almost
unlimited access.

&#39;Just wish I knew how it all happened,&#39; Beth thought
as she got up from the borrowed terminal, her red hair
bouncing slightly against her neck. &#39;If I didn&#39;t know
better I&#39;d think the damage had been done
deliberately...&#39; she mused as she walked out. The
lifts and a not so short walk brought her back to
familiar territory, the section designated for the
unit nicknamed &#39;Chasers.&#39;

&quot;Hey, Beth,&quot; Julie smiled from where the black haired
young woman was sitting in the middle of the computer
center.

Beth grinned back, &quot;How&#39;s it feel to be in the
hot-seat today?&quot;

&quot;Uncomfortable,&quot; Julie conceded. She dropped her voice
a little, &quot;Watch out for the boss, I think she&#39;s in a
mood.&quot;

Beth frowned in concern, &quot;I&#39;d better check in.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your skin,&quot; Julie sighed, watching Beth leave
with a odd look. Most of the time Beth would tease her
at least a little, yet today nothing.

Beth went down the hall to the door marked &#39;Section
Chief&#39; and knocked, hearing Gwen&#39;s voice call,
&quot;Enter.&quot;

&quot;Reporting my return from enemy territory,&quot; Beth
saluted mockingly as she entered.

Gwen Musashi was beautiful, though Beth knew her
opinion was a bit biased. The black haired Asian woman
was dressed as elegantly as ever, and Beth could
easily imagine the body that filled those clothes out
so nicely. Her expression was faintly amused as she
asked Beth, &quot;Surely it wasn&#39;t that bad?&quot;

&quot;Take the ongoing tension between us and the regular
police and add in having a outsider go over their
system for problems...&quot; Beth shrugged elegantly.

&quot;How bad is it?&quot; Gwen asked intently.

&quot;Their security is crap,&quot; Beth said promptly, &quot;and
there are traces of multiple incursions. I&#39;ve done a
rough fix, but they need a overhaul of their entire
security scheme.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t their regular computer team spot it?&quot; Gwen
blinked.

&quot;The regulars are just officers who have computer
experience, they have their own case loads to worry
about,&quot; Beth explained, &quot;as long as it looked all
right, they approved the system. The hack made
everything look good on the surface, you have to dig
to realize what was wrong.&quot;

Gwen thought about it a moment, looking up towards the
roof of her office. &quot;Was it an inside job?&quot; she asked
quietly.

&quot;I dunno,&quot; Beth admitted. &quot;Back when I was hacking I
could have pulled something like this off, but I&#39;d
leave traces. I couldn&#39;t find any signs of that when I
was checking,&quot; she finished.

&quot;Gah,&quot; Gwen made a face. &quot;There&#39;s not much we can do
on our end,&quot; she murmured, &quot;other than maintain our
own security.&quot;

&quot;Which gets problematic, considering headquarters
needs to have access to our systems,&quot; Beth agreed
glumly. She hesitated a moment, about to say something
then shut her mouth.

&quot;What?&quot; Gwen asked, spotting the motion.

Beth looked just a bit guilty, &quot;I&#39;ve set up certain
firewalls around our confidential files and security
systems to flag certain kinds of access, even if it&#39;s
official.&quot;

&quot;You do realize that&#39;s in violation of several
regulations?&quot; Gwen smiled, &quot;Good job.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Beth grinned. She hesitated, looking up at
Gwen tentatively, &quot;Do you have anything planned
tonight?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Gwen smiled slightly, &quot;do you have any ideas?&quot;

Beth just smiled, eyes twinkling.

Meanwhile, a group of women were leaving a detention
center in Lowtown, the constant twilight of the lower
levels of the city making it difficult to tell the
time. Dr. Alexis Jameson walked with several of them
to the street as the black haired woman sighed, &quot;Well,
that was the first time I&#39;ve been arrested in a
while.&quot;

&quot;What, you used to do it regularly?&quot; the dark haired
android asked, a faint scar marking her face from
where someone had used a simple sealer to close a
gash.

&quot;In my younger days, Yume,&quot; Alexis said honestly.

&quot;I&#39;m still getting used to it,&quot; the little redhead
said. Ariko smiled slightly, &quot;I&#39;m glad you two were
along with me.&quot;

Yume reached to take Ariko&#39;s hand, squeezing it
gently. &quot;Glad to help you,&quot; she said, looking down to
meet her eyes warmly.

&#39;People who say that freewills aren&#39;t sentient should
meet these two,&#39; Alexis thought fondly. She smiled at
them wryly as the rest of their crowd began to
disperse, &quot;Could I beg a lift up to where transit
vehicles will pickup?&quot;

&quot;Your office is in Midtown, right?&quot; Yume asked as she
lead the way over to a battered van, &quot;I could take you
all the way there, if you don&#39;t mind riding in my junk
heap.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d appreciate it,&quot; Alexis climbed into the rear
seat, leaving the front for Yume and Ariko. Locking
the seat belt around her waist she added cheerfully,
&quot;And this junk heap isn&#39;t much worse than what I used
to drive.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I can&#39;t quite see that,&quot; Ariko conceded,
looking back at the nicely dressed dark haired woman
with glasses.

&quot;I had a rebellious stage,&quot; Alexis conceded. She was
going to say something else when she got a good look
at her watch and cried, &quot;I&#39;m late!&quot;

Yume exchanged a look with Ariko before asking mildly,
&quot;Should I hurry?&quot;

&quot;My fault,&quot; Alexis shook her head, &quot;I even forgot the
appointment was today.&quot; She dialed the cellphone, then
waited with a frown, &quot;Where...?&quot;

&quot;I think getting arrested would be a good excuse?&quot;
Ariko offered mildly.

Yume chuckled as she snuck a glance at Alexis, &quot;Guess
not.&quot;

&quot;Kate!&quot; Alexis barked as the phone was picked up.

&quot;Gee,&quot; Kate sounded innocent, &quot;here I am, sitting in
front of your office and nobody&#39;s here. I&#39;m so
shocked.&quot;

&quot;Why do I doubt that?&quot; Alexis mused. She smiled wryly,
&quot;You heard about my being arrested in a protest, I
take it?&quot;

&quot;Gwen was amused,&quot; Kate said honestly.

&quot;I&#39;m going to get a lecturing phone call from her,
huh?&quot; Alexis sighed.

Kate chuckled, &quot;Probably, though I think she&#39;s a wee
bit distracted.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Alexis asked.

&quot;Gwen went out on a date recently,&quot; Kate passed the
gossip on.

Alexis felt an odd chill settle in her bones, silently
cursing her reaction. She and Gwen had dated, but they
had been broken up longer than they had been together.
Clearing her throat she changed the subject, &quot;Do you
want to reschedule for later this week?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Kate answered promptly.

Alexis actually blinked in surprise before asking, &quot;No
arguments? I thought you hated having these sessions.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re growing on me,&quot; Kate paused, &quot;like a fungus.&quot;

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Alexis grumbled before setting a date
and hanging up.

Yume actually chuckled softly as Alexis hung up.
&quot;Interesting friends you have, from what I heard on
this end.&quot;

Alexis smiled back wryly as she put her phone back,
&quot;You have no idea.&quot;</pre>
