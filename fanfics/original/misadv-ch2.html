<a href="../original/misadv-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Phase Two: The Seduction of Anna 

&quot;Anna, what do you think of this one?&quot; 

A few hours after Holly-Raine and Anna had agreed to see each other. It 
was about 3.30, lessons were over now, so the two of them could go out 
and have some fun before they had to hit the books at Anna&#39;s house. 
Anna had only been living in Victoria for a short while, so she had 
never experienced much of what the town had to offer. Soon as Holly 
learned this, she agreed to show Anna around before they went home to 
study. In a flash they went downtown and hit the largest mall they 
could find. The two girls window-shopped around and about, checking out 
some of the new CD&#39;s out this week. After a couple of shakes and some 
fries, Anna and Holly stopped over at a clothes shop and took a look at 
the merchandise on offer.  

Currently, Anna was at the back of the shop, next to the dressing 
rooms. She hadn&#39;t seen anything she liked, not from here at least. All 
the while, Holly-Raine was inside the dressing rooms, changing into one 
of the many outfits she had taken a shine to. This store was rather 
expensive, Anna couldn&#39;t afford the majority of clothes here, but Holly 
could. Holly&#39;s father was a stockbroker, and a successful one. She was 
by no means rich; after all she was attending a public school, but her 
family was well off. With a cheerful giggle, Holly stepped out of the 
dressing booth to show off her chosen dress, giving a pirouette to show 
it off.  

Anna nodded in approval. The dress was body length, obviously. The 
colour was a simple white, but tight around the hips and chest, just 
enough to show present Holly&#39;s &#39;bodily assets&#39; to the world. The silk 
white gloves and ashen high heels were a nice touch, too. The whole 
outfit seemed formal at most, but it suited Holly with a passion. 
Especially since the chestnut brown of her shining silk hair contrasted 
the pure white of the dress. Absolutely wonderful.  

&quot;It looks great on you, Holly.&quot; Anna said honestly. &quot;But how much does 
all that cost?&quot; 

Holly-Raine held a finger to her chin as she looked off in thought. 
&quot;Hmmm. For the dress and the shoes and the gloves? Ooh, I&#39;d say it&#39;s 
about 90 bucks.&quot; 

Anna blinked. &quot;C-Can you afford that?&quot; 

&quot;Sure. My dad does have quite a bit of money, &#39;course, I don&#39;t like 
walking around with that kinda cash, but I planned to buy some stuff 
today. Is that why you&#39;re not trying on anything?&quot; 

&quot;Not really... I just don&#39;t think these clothes suit me. That&#39;s all.&quot; 

Holly just shrugged and walked back into the booth. As she begun to 
undress out of the white dress she had been wearing, she spoke out to 
Anna again. &quot;I gotcha. So what was Minnesota like? Hell of a lot more 
fun than redneck heaven, huh...?&quot; 

&quot;I liked Minnesota.&quot; Anna said in earnest. And she did. In fact she was 
missing it a little. &quot;But I like it here too. Everyone&#39;s been so nice 
to me and everything.&quot; 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Holly said distractedly. &quot;...Um, Anna, could you come in here 
and tell me how this looks?&quot; 

Anna shuffled her feet a bit. &quot;Can you just come out here?&quot; 

&quot;Uh... I&#39;d kinda don&#39;t want to have someone see this.&quot; 

Oh well. What could be so private that she couldn&#39;t step out of the 
dressing room? Anna opened the door to Holly&#39;s booth, but her questions 
were answered with full force. Holly stood before the young blonde with 
an embarrassed smile, clad only in a skimpy two-piece black bikini. 
Anna gulped. She had never, ever been comfortable around someone else&#39;s 
cleavage. At that little swimsuit Holly was wearing showed off more 
than she ever expected.  

Anna&#39;s eyes ducked to one side as she felt the heat rise to her cheeks.  

&quot;Well?&quot; Holly began. &quot;What do you think of my swimsuit?&quot; 

&quot;Uh... Holly, it&#39;s... don&#39;t you think it&#39;s a bit late in the year to be 
buying things like that? Summer ended weeks ago.&quot; 

Holly just nodded. &quot;Yeah, I know. But my family is taking a trip to the 
Caribbean at the end of September. Something about business there. I 
just want to pick up a tan while I&#39;m there, even if it&#39;s only for a 
week or so. What do you think?&quot; 

Anna struggled to speak. &quot;It&#39;s... nice. I think it looks nice on you.&quot; 

Holly-Raine let out a pleasant smile and a giddy chuckle, wrapping her 
arms around an uncomfortable Anna. The brown-haired girl whispered a 
gentle &#39;thanks, Anna&#39; into the ear of the other girl, and settled her 
head against Anna&#39;s shoulder. Anna herself was incredulous. Holly was 
hugging her. But that was not the most... unnerving part of the 
situation. Holly&#39;s small, pert breasts were pressed up against her own. 
And since the fabric of the bikini was so slight, she could quite 
easily feel Holly-Raine&#39;s little pink nipples poking against the shirt 
that Anna had worn to school. This lasted for a few seconds until 
Holly-Raine released Anna from her hug and stepped back. Anna was still 
addled. She knew that Holly was a friendly, affectionate person; that 
was obvious. But... why would she do something like that? After a few 
seconds, Anna realized that Holly wanted her to leave so she could get 
changed, so Anna slipped out of the room with a still confused mind.  

The rest of their day out was pretty much uneventful. Some guys hanging 
outside the computer games store asked out Holly on a few dates, but 
she just turned them down saying &#39;that wasn&#39;t my scene&#39;. After that, 
and a few more visits to some other clothes stores, Holly and Anna 
decided to leave, and head to Anna&#39;s house. Well, rather, Holly decided 
that they should go to her house to work on the History project. Anna 
was still confused by what had happened in the dressing rooms with 
Holly.  

What did it mean? 

Sure, Anna was uncomfortable; most people would be when placed in that 
situation. But there was also a layer of... relaxedness that the hug 
gave. She felt almost secure with Holly-Raine holding her. But what did 
it all mean? And just what did that say about Anna. The blonde-haired 
girl tried hard not to think about it. Maybe she was just blowing 
things out of proportion. The two girls left the mall, by now it was 
6.15, so they had to get started soon. They journeyed to the nearest 
bus stop, and hopped on a bus as soon as one came.  

By 6.30, the bus had reached Anna&#39;s area. They stepped off it and 
walked through the quiet residential area. Holly studied this place 
with her wide green eyes. The houses seemed so warm and inviting. Anna 
on the other hand was still distracted. She couldn&#39;t stop thinking 
about the way Holly had held her just a few hours prior. Or the way 
that it made her feel. And it was this that Anna&#39;s brain focused on, 
until she felt a soft hand latch on to her own. Anna looked up with a 
gasp, only to see Holly smiling sweetly at her.  

Anna and Holly where still walking at the time, so Anna didn&#39;t think 
much of releasing this grip. All the same it was curious. But Holly was 
the first to address this situation.  

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Holly asked quietly. &quot;You seem kinda distracted.&quot; 

Anna blushed again. Her rosy cheeks gave it away so easily. She just 
couldn&#39;t understand what was going on here. But rather than think about 
this, Anna&#39;s reflexes did the work. Her fingers interlocked with 
Holly&#39;s, securing the clasping of their hands. And again, Anna felt 
butterflies in her stomach as Holly smiled at her. What were these new 
feelings? These new sensations? How had they sprung up so easily? Anna 
had no answer for this. But at least, for the moment, these new 
emotions were not troubling her. The two continued to walk along the 
pavement, hand in hand, until Anna spotted her home.  

&quot;T-That&#39;s my house.&quot; Anna stuttered. &quot;Shall we go in?&quot; 

Holly-Raine just beamed another one of those trademark smiles of 
comfort. &quot;Well I don&#39;t plan on spending my time out here now, do I?&quot; 

Anna giggled a little, almost childishly, and fished out a set of keys 
from her pocket. When Holly released her soft grasp of her hand, Anna 
felt the strangest tingle of longing as she lost contact with the 
brown-haired girl. But, she shook it off and walked up the cobblestone 
pathway to her door. Anna quickly slotted her key into the door and 
unlocked it, opening the door.  

&quot;Come in.&quot; Anna spoke, stepping inside and placing her book bag down 
against the inner wall. Holly stepped into Anna&#39;s home and gave it a 
quick eye over. Beige walls, decorated netting, a few paintings and 
photos along the walls, nothing out of the ordinary, just a normal 
home.  

Then suddenly, a thought came to Holly-Raine&#39;s brain. &quot;Hey, what time 
will your mom be coming home? Anytime soon?&quot; 

Anna shook her head. &quot;No. My mom works overnight on Mondays, so she 
won&#39;t be back until at least one. To be honest, I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have 
to be in this house on my own, Holly.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s okay.&quot; Holly reassured. &quot;I&#39;m glad I could come. But I suppose 
we should get started on the History Project. Where&#39;s your room?&quot; 

Anna walked over to the staircase and pointed upward. &quot;Just go 
upstairs, turn left, and follow the path to the second door from the 
right. That&#39;s my room.&quot; 

After breathing a quick &#39;great&#39;, Holly flung her book bag over her 
shoulder and walked upstairs, leaving her shopping bags downstairs. 
While Holly went into her room to get ready, Anna walked into her 
kitchen to rustle up some drinks for herself and Holly. Her mom had yet 
to do any shopping, so there was not much on offer, the most she could 
find was a two-litre bottle of lemonade. The blonde haired girl poured 
out some of it into two glasses, fastened the bottle top, and placed in 
back in the fridge. Clasping both glasses in either hand, Anna stepped 
out the kitchen and upstairs, towards her room. The door was open, and 
Holly was sitting patiently on Anna&#39;s bed, giggling innocently at a 
picture of Anna as a child.  

Holly stifled her laughter. &quot;You were so cute as a child.&quot; 

Anna felt un-strangely embarrassed. That picture was of her as a five 
year old, when she had been giving her first taste of ice cream. Her 
face was covered with sprinkles and traces of cream, while the young 
Anna beamed a toothy grin.  

&quot;That picture makes me look so silly.&quot; Anna said nervously. &quot;W-Would 
you like a lemonade?&quot; 

Holly gave a short nod with a smile, and clasped one of the glasses in 
Anna&#39;s hand. She placed the picture back on the nightstand next to 
Anna&#39;s bed, and took a quick gulp of the drinks she had been given. 
Anna did the same, and then sat down on the bed, her school books in 
tow. First things first, she put down her lemonade, and rustled the 
books out of her bag, the ones taken out from the school library. There 
was more than enough information to get this thing started. Just then, 
Anna was about to say something, until she heard the distinct sound of 
a splash.  

Anna looked across to see Holly, shutting her eyes in embarrassment. 
She had spilled the lemonade over her skirt and blouse. &quot;Of all the 
stupid... damn. Sorry about that, Anna, I&#39;m such a klutz. I&#39;m going to 
have to get changed into some of the clothes I bought today. Where&#39;s 
your bathroom?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s just next to this room.&quot; Anna said.  

Holly just nodded and walked through the door, then headed downstairs 
to pick up some of the clothes she had bought. Anna shifted over the 
bed and picked up the glass that had rolled onto the floor. Holly had 
said before that she was kinda clumsy, but how could she just spill 
lemonade over herself like that? Ten minutes later, Anna had managed to 
put her focus back into the project. That was until Holly walked back 
into the room. 

&quot;Have you started yet...?&quot; 

Anna&#39;s eyes widened, she had barely heard the words uttered from 
Holly-Raine&#39;s mouth. All she could understand was what she was wearing. 
Holly was clad in a skintight shirt, a pale summer yellow, a shirt that 
flaunted her vivacious chest and ended there. Her navel was completely 
exposed, revealing that smooth, firm stomach again. The other piece of 
clothing on her body was a very small pair of jeans shorts, sheared at 
the leg holes, giving it that &#39;car wash&#39; look. Aside from those two 
articles, Holly was wearing nothing else, not even any socks or shoes; 
those had been left with her soiled clothes.  

Once more, Anna was thrown for six. But this time, she couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to look away from Holly&#39;s angelic body. What was going on here? 
Why was she feeling like this? If Holly was aware that Anna was so 
restless, she showed no signs of it, as she sat down quite calmly on 
the bed again, once more she gave off that guiltless smile of hers.  

&quot;Well?&quot; She started eagerly. &quot;Have you gotten started yet?&quot; 

Anna shook her head, just about able to tear her eyes away from 
Holly-Raine. &quot;...Not yet.&quot; 

Not that she was concerned by the project anymore. Anna was far too 
jolted by Holly&#39;s choice of clothing. Holly herself took one of the 
books into her hand and began to read, while, on occasion, Anna would 
steal a quick glance at the beautiful girl on her bed. In particular, 
it was Holly&#39;s legs that gathered the most attention. Long, shapely, 
bare, and almost divine in their sculpture. While admiring them, Anna 
felt a dull throb beginning to take shape between her own legs, at 
their apex, her crotch. Was she... actually attracted to Holly? Anna 
couldn&#39;t quite get her head around it. But she had to admit that the 
thought of being with Holly-Raine that way was not un-appealing. In 
fact... it was sort of charming. Anna ducked her eyes back to her book 
before Holly caught her gaze, and hoped that this feeling would pass. 
Holly was the first friend that she had gotten since she came to 
Victoria. She didn&#39;t want to spoil that.  

Suddenly, Holly spoke up. &quot;Anna... do you have a boyfriend?&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; The blonde looked up from the book. &quot;Boyfriend? No... I&#39;ve... 
never been with anybody in that way.&quot; 

Holly blinked. &quot;Really?&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh.&quot; Anna confirmed that. &quot;Even if I was with someone, I wouldn&#39;t 
know how to go about it. I... guess you must think I&#39;m a loser&#133;&quot; 

Holly slowly moved over to Anna across the bed, and placed a reassuring 
hand on her shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a loser. You&#39;re just taking 
your time. But I find it hard to believe that a girl as cute as you has 
never kissed someone.&quot; 

Anna felt that throbbing again. &quot;You... you think I&#39;m cute?&quot; 

&quot;Sure you are.&quot; Holly said calmly. &quot;And loads of people would agree 
with me. I know, I&#39;ll teach you how to kiss!&quot; 

Anna&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;Huh?&quot; 

&quot;I said I&#39;ll teach you how to kiss. You should know things like that 
before you start dating. Otherwise people just take advantage of you. 
Is that okay?&quot; 

Anna simply nodded. This sounded so crazy in her head... but Holly was 
just so sweet, there was no way she could offend her by saying no. The 
young blonde froze in place as Holly leaned over to her. They were so 
close that Anna could feel Holly&#39;s warm breath on lips. And smell that 
sweet rosy scent of hers.  

Holly&#39;s voice was getting a little huskier. &quot;Close your eyes...&quot; 

Anna complied, shutting both eyelids. She could see nothing. All see 
was aware of was the feel of Holly&#39;s breath on her lips. But that 
didn&#39;t last long. Anna&#39;s breathing suddenly jumpstarted as Holly 
pressed her soft pink lips up against her own. Her hand tense then 
loosened as Anna received her first kiss. But she was so nervous, she 
couldn&#39;t respond to Holly&#39;s actions. But then, Holly really didn&#39;t seem 
to care. The young brunette tilted her head to the side and desperately 
pushed her hot tongue past Anna&#39;s lips. This caught Anna off guard, 
just becoming aware that Holly-Raine had slipped Anna her tongue. All 
the same she enjoyed this feeling, this feeling of connection to Holly. 
Though she was inexperienced, Anna followed Holly&#39;s actions. Holly 
flicked at Anna&#39;s tongue with her own, savouring the heat and taste of 
the other girl&#39;s mouth. Anna released a deep, longing sigh as Holly 
deepened their kiss, her gentle probing becoming a little more 
forceful.  

It was happening. Anna never really expected her first kiss to be with 
a woman. She had never even thought much of relationships. But her 
feelings had been jumbled in the past few months, and from her reaction 
to seeing Holly-Raine half-naked, well, maybe this was the reason 
behind her unrest. All the new emotions swirling in her head altered 
her judgement. So much so that she didn&#39;t actually realize that Holly&#39;s 
wasn&#39;t just kissing her. The brunette&#39;s delicate hands began to idly 
roam around Anna&#39;s youthful body. They started from Anna&#39;s flowing 
locks of blonde hair, playing with stray strands of it. Then Holly&#39;s 
hands slid down her back, and stopped at the globes of Anna&#39;s tight 
little ass. Anna let off a small &#39;mmmmm...&#39; as Holly squeezed at her 
firm behind, restricted by her clothes. Again, Holly&#39;s hands took an 
initiative, and came upwards, moving around Anna&#39;s body. Then they 
grasped at Anna&#39;s breasts.  

Anna broke the kiss with a gasp, just about managing to break out of 
her deliria. &quot;H-Holly?&quot; 

But by now, Holly-Raine was too far-gone to even listen properly. She 
had been waiting for this all day. Holly did everything to charm and 
seduce Anna, from presenting her body in a bikini, to spilling lemonade 
on herself and changing into one tight getup. All for this moment. Now 
her pussy was leaking out love juices from the sheer anticipation of 
enjoying Anna&#39;s angel-like body. The horny teen licked her lips, sodden 
with the saliva of her newfound lover, and continued playing with 
Anna&#39;s breasts.  

&quot;Anna...&quot; Holly&#39;s voice reeked of arousal. &quot;You don&#39;t have to worry. 
I&#39;ll take good care of you.&quot; 

&quot;...Well...I...mmmph!&quot; 

Anna was cut off mid-statement as Holly, claimed another kiss from her. 
Anna was too confused to do anything else, plus she just loved the 
feeling of Holly&#39;s kiss. It all overwhelmed her. She couldn&#39;t protest, 
even if she wanted to. Soon as Anna began to settle again, Holly 
stopped toying with her breasts, and began to undress the blonde. After 
breaking their kiss again, Holly pulled the up the blue shirt that Anna 
was wearing, lifting it off her soft body. Holly tossed it to one side, 
getting out of the way. Now the only thing standing between Holly and 
Anna&#39;s uncovered tits were that pesky little white bra. Holly reached 
around Anna&#39;s body with both arms and unfastened it quickly, until it 
fell in a pile around the young Anna&#39;s lap. Again, Holly-Raine threw 
that now needless article away, then greedily eyed Anna&#39;s healthy 
chest.  

Holly studied every feature of Anna&#39;s newly unveiled breasts like an 
art critic studying a painting. The twin mounds of flesh stood 
prominently, without being oversized like so many others. They were 
small, but firm and gently rounded, boasting a soft, satin-like feel 
along with a creamy tone, contrasted by her rapidly hardening pink 
nipples. Holly licked her lips again, while Anna just sat before an 
entranced girl, completely topless. Though her eyes were shut, she 
could feel Holly&#39;s emerald green eyes staring at her upper torso, 
making her nipples swell into hardness. Suddenly Anna&#39;s eyes shot open 
again as Holly&#39;s mouth latched onto her left breast.  

Holly sucked at the mound with the greed of a thief, occasionally 
flicking at the pink nub with her wet tongue. Anna moaned softly, her 
eyes rolling in the back of her head. Her nipples were quite sensitive, 
so the feeling it gave her was unbelievable. As Anna continued to moan, 
Holly continued to suckle, her right hand grabbing at the other breast. 
She tenderly caressed it, rubbing her thumb over the erect cerise nub 
continuously. Anna leaned back until her back touched the bedspread, 
lying evenly across the bed, while Holly continued to suck and fondle 
with her sweet little globes of flesh. It was then that Holly realized 
how much she liked the sounds of Anna&#39;s moans, and bit her nipple 
playfully to get a stronger reaction.  

She got one. &quot;H-Holly... what... are... you... doing to me...?&quot; 

Anna&#39;s throat released a quick and sharp gasp, and shut her eyes, her 
cheeks already flushed from Holly&#39;s attention. A trail of saliva began 
to leak out from Holly&#39;s mouth as she feasted on Anna&#39;s ample mounds, 
the trail trickling down the outline of her chest. The brunette 
continued to suck hard at Anna&#39;s left breast, while her left hand 
reached down to Anna&#39;s waist and began to pull down her skirt. Holly 
tried to pull it down, but it wouldn&#39;t give, so she had to un-clamp her 
mouth from her lover&#39;s mound. Giving the stiff nipple one last playful 
bite, Holly-Raine pulled back, a thick trail of saliva connecting 
Anna&#39;s nipple to her mouth. It broke, and then Holly smiled over at 
Anna, just before she yanked her skirt down, along with her panties. 
This time it gave way, and Holly quickly removed it. Anna was now 
completely naked, her shoes and socks had somehow come off during their 
kiss.  

Now Anna&#39;s pride and glory, the beautiful, sparking-with-wetness 
vagina. Holly marvelled at it with some awe. In almost a trance of 
lust, Holly lowered her head between Anna&#39;s thighs. The blonde girl 
snapped out of her own reverie when she felt Holly&#39;s breath against her 
wet opening, and her eyes widened with alarm. Holly was not aware of 
Anna&#39;s confusion, so wasted no time taking it slow. She quickly 
separated her lower lips with her hand, while the other hand continued 
to grope at Anna&#39;s right breast. Anna&#39;s raised head dropped back unto 
her pillow with a loud thump, and she cried out as Holly-Raine&#39;s tongue 
slipped between the folds of her tight pussy.  

Anna&#39;s gasps and moans became more frequent as Holly&#39;s tongue worked 
it&#39;s magic inside her. The legs of the girl writhed and her hips bucked 
against Holly&#39;s mouth, Anna&#39;s lust and pleasure was now the only thing 
on Holly&#39;s mind. Holly drove her tongue along the silky innards of 
Anna&#39;s centre, savouring that sweet taste a teen&#39;s wetness. She licked 
and sucked, but made it a policy to avoid her clit. There was no way 
she was going to blow her plan by letting Anna cum.  

Holly opened one of her eyes, and tried to look at Anna&#39;s face, to see 
far it might be till she released. From the way her face was 
contorting, it was probably only a matter of time till she exploded all 
over. Giving Anna&#39;s unbearably gorgeous pussy one final flick of the 
tongue, Holly withdrew from between Anna&#39;s thighs, her mouth and chin 
soaked by the Minnesota girl&#39;s love juices. Anna&#39;s panting slowed down 
a little when she realized that Holly had stopped, and her searching 
sapphire blue eyes stared up at the brunette in confusion. It felt as 
though she was about to reach some awesome conclusion, like a huge 
barrier was about to burst from within. Why did Holly stop? The young 
woman had a sneaky smile on her face, grinning at a naked and 
vulnerable Anna.  

&quot;Oh no.&quot; She whispered, licking her lips. &quot;You can&#39;t climax that 
easily. That&#39;ll spoil all the fun.&quot; 

After giving Anna a quick smile of approval, Holly-Raine slipped out 
the door and headed downstairs. Anna was still bamboozled. Why had 
Holly left like that? And what did she mean by &#39;spoil all the fun&#39;?</pre>
