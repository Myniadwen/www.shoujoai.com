<h1>Duet 3</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>If Janice looked anymore depressed she could be prescribed prozac 
without a prescription--- or something stronger.

&#147;You act like I said our sex life was dead. It&#146;s not that bad. We can 
still do it while they&#146;re here, she&#146;s a grown woman.&#148;

&#147;A grown woman WITH a boyfriend! Why is she bringing her boyfriend 
into OUR apartment? Can&#146;t I just pay to have her stay at a hotel or 
something? Really nice one with thick walls so nobody has to listen to 
them thumping.&#148;

&#147;My sister is visiting and I promised she could stay here---&#148;

&#147;What about me? Don&#146;t I have any say about this arrangement?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry but you said I could bring anyone here.&#148;

&#147;I was kind of implying that you&#146;d bring another lesbian. At least a 
bi girl, but NOT a straight girl and her boy toy! I know she&#146;s your 
sister but I&#146;m not comfortable having to make love with a man in the 
next room!&#148;

&#147;We could abstain for their stay---&#148;

&#147;Now I didn&#146;t say that. I hate that word, by the way, don&#146;t bring it 
up again.&#148; (sighs) &#147;But honestly! Two weeks of your sister and her boy 
toy camped out here on the couch? And there&#146;s NO way in hell she&#146;s 
getting MY ROOM! She wants in I&#146;m shoving her and her boy into the 
closet. It was good enough for those two girls we had here a few 
months ago it&#146;s good enough for her.&#148;

&#147;She said the couch is fine. She won&#146;t intrude.&#148;

&#147;So why did I have to clean the bathroom and move my reading 
materials?&#148;

&#147;It makes the place look like a brothel. And you promised you would 
clean out the hamper so we can put clothes in there, remember?&#148;

&#147;Fine. It&#146;s in my closet so she or her boy won&#146;t find it. Still, 
they&#146;ll probably bring their own dirty reading with them---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not that bad. They&#146;ll be fine---&#148; (someone knocks at the door) 
&#147;---and here they are now.&#148;

&#147;Send them away for dinner. I don&#146;t cook for strangers.&#148;

&#147;Janice! Behave please!&#148; (walks over and opens the door, inviting her 
sister and her lover inside). &#147;Janice, this is my oldest sister 
Vanessa and her friend Anthony.&quot; Crystal allows.

&quot;Nice to meet you two.&quot; Janice shakes Vanessa&#39;s hand. She is gorgeous. 
Her honey toned skin glows. Her flowing hair caresses the nape of her 
neck, and her sea green eyes remind Janice of at least two or three 
famous models. Her slim hourglass form is nearly hidden in the loose 
baggy jeans that adorn her chiseled body. And the plain tee shirt she 
is wearing perks outwards thanks to her large breasts.

&#145;What the hell did Crissy say she did again?&#146; Janice suddenly thinks 
to herself, &#145;I&#146;m blanking out here--- maybe he&#146;ll be easier to 
fathom---&#146; (looks him over) &#145;---not.&#146;

And as glamorous as Vanessa is, her consort is completely the 
opposite. He is obviously a roughneck from the &#39;hood. His skin is 
darker in tone. He is completely oblivious to everyone and everything 
around him. It is quite obvious that he doesn&#39;t want to be here. 
&#146;Feelings mutual, bub.&#146; Janice thinks sarcastically to herself.

His head is shaven completely bald. He is about six feet two, nearly 
four feet taller than Vanessa&#39;s five foot eight height. He has a 
cigarette in his mouth, which is in complete contrast to his chiseled, 
Adonis body. He certainly lifts weights. And aside from the great sex 
life this black Apollo certainly provides for Vanessa (which Janice 
secretly considers nothing compared to her talents), Janice wonders 
why the two of them are together. There is certainly more than meets 
the eye here. And eventually, Janice plans to get to the root of the 
matter. &#145;After I get him to behavior modification school&#146;.

&quot;Good to meet you Janice. Crystal has said so much about you. This is 
my friend Anthony.&quot; Vanessa responds with a smile.

&quot;A.D. for short slim.&quot; Anthony chimes in with his deep assertive 
voice, as he gives Janice a pound. (NOTE: that&#39;s slang for a stylized 
handshake! LOL!)

&#147;Uhhh---&#148; (watches handshake with confusion, allowing him to manhandle 
her numb arm for abit to shake hands his own way) &quot;Oh-kay&#133;!! A.D., 
huh? Right--- well, it&#146;s good to meet you.&quot; Janice states with a less 
than thrilled demeanor. She looks over at Crystal, who is setting the 
table, and realizes that her lover is acting rather strangely.

With a slight excuse Janice rolls over to the table and nudges 
Crystal. &#147;Dinner&#146;s going to take another few minutes in the oven. 
Let&#146;s run quickly over to the mini mart at the corner and pick up some 
confectionery treats for dessert.&#147;

Before Crystal can protest she&#146;s dragged right out the door as Janice 
makes their apologies and excuse to step out for a second.

-----

&#147;Her boy better not be a pickpocket or so help me I&#146;m going to skin 
him even cleaner than his head--- and I mean down to the bone!&#147; 
(sighs) &#147;Alright, Crystal, you already told me how much you did NOT 
like this little union, but she&#146;s your sister and heaven forbid you 
couldn&#146;t say no to her. So, you going to pout about this all night or 
you going to tell me what&#146;s wrong?&#148;

Silence. Crystal just pouts as they walk into the mini mart. &#147;Alright, 
alright, fine then. It&#146;s just another mystery to be solved. You can 
handle your sugars, right?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;So let&#146;s get lots of sweet stuffs. No chips. Let&#146;s go ice cream 
cookies &amp; ice cream and more ice cream. And maybe some whipped cream 
and nuts and chocolate---&#148;

&#147;Are you trying to put A.D into a hypoglycemic coma?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t see you minding if he was comatose so why make me look bad by 
doing it? And it&#146;s not that easy to put people into hypoglycemic 
comas. You&#146;ll have to be happy with him getting a headache from eating 
too much cold stuff too fast.&#148; (pays for stuff) &#147;Let&#146;s go. By the time 
we return it should be dinner time.&#148;

-----

When they return to the apartment the two aren&#146;t there.

&#147;Where are---&#148; Janice stops. &#147;---Crissy? Be a dear and check the 
room.&#148;

&#147;Wh-? Why?&#148;

&#147;Be a dear and check the room. I&#146;ll be in the kitchen--- sharpening 
knives.&#148;

&#147;---&#148;

As Janice plates up dinner and puts it on the table Crystal returns 
from the bedroom. &#147;They&#146;re not in there, but they&#146;ll be awhile--- 
they&#146;re in the bathroom.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t tell me, let me guess. Nature called and it wasn&#146;t the call 
that demands a waste disposal.&#148; (Crystal only nods) &#147;So how long.&#148;

&#147;Half an hour?&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s start without them then.&#148;

&#147;Janice? Isn&#146;t that--- rude?&#148;

&#147;Five minutes in my house and your sister&#146;s being fucked in my 
bathtub. At what point does me wanting to eat in my own kitchen while 
she boffs in my tub considered at all rude?&#148;

&#147;---I see your point---&#148;

Clearly the first meal together wasn&#146;t going well.

After A.D. and Vanessa have exited the bathroom once they have 
finished their short romp, they are greeted at the dinner table by 
their hostesses with a completely finished meal. &quot;Sorry about that.&quot; 
Anthony starts. &quot;We had to fix Vanessa&#39;s zipper in the back of her 
dress.&#148; (Janice - &#147;Yuh-huh.&#148;) &#147;It was stuck on a piece of cloth.&quot; He 
lies. As Janice listens she rolls her eyes at the comments and motions 
for them to sit.

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Crystal looks at them both with doubt. &#147;Alright, Crystal, 
let the kids be. You know how those cheap thrift store dresses are, 
girl.&quot; Janice remarks dully, going for seconds as she watches the two 
sit down. Vanessa starts to light herself a cigarette. Anthony is all 
ready smoking his own.

&quot;Well, I hope everybody is hungry. I want to eat quickly before lung 
cancer sets in! (Nobody even asks if I WANT smoking in MY pad!) Let&#39;s 
eat!&quot; Janice interrupts, glaring at the two as she motions for them to 
put their cigarettes out.

&quot;I&#39;m hungry as shit!&quot; Anthony bellows.

&quot;Then stop smoking long enough to taste the food why dontcha&#146;!&quot; Janice 
hisses, making a move across the table to de-cig each guest. &#147;Behave 
and I&#145;ll introduce you to my better sex lotions and aphrodisiacs 
that&#145;ll make sex a brush with death experience.&#148;

Everyone sits around the table and prepares to eat, though Janice was 
already ready quite awhile now. Anthony and Vanessa sit next to each 
other while Crystal and Janice sit next to one another. The television 
is on in the background, but the volume is low enough for everyone to 
hear one another speak. With a tired yawn Janice pulls the remote out 
from under the table and clicks the TV off. &#147;Spare remote. Just in 
case.&#148;

As everyone starts eating, Janice starts the dinner off with 
questions. 

&#147;So, Vanessa, what do you do for a living?&#148;

&#147;I work at a temp agency.&#148;

&#147;Which is far too beneath you!&#148; Crystal grumbles.

&#147;Funny.&#148; Janice remarks slyly, giving Crystal a dirty look, &#147;This from 
a person who insists on weekly trips to the corner Laundromat where 
all the losers hang out.&#148;

&#147;---it saves money! And it&#146;s filled with ambiance!&#148;

&#147;Uh-huh.&#148; (Janice smiles) &#147;You know the dirty feelings one gets from 
straddling a washer on full speed?&#148; (Crystal shakes her head) &#147;Me 
neither. Washers can&#146;t take the weight of a full grown woman without 
shutting off and flashing &#147;unbalanced load&#148;. I tried it once. So---&#148; 
(Crystal sweat drops at Janice&#146;s chipper mood) &#147;What does the A.D. do 
for a living? A girl gotta know.&#148;

A.D. - &#147;----&#148;

Crystal - &#147;He&#146;s NOT working, Jan. He&#146;s a freeloader.&#148;

A.D. - &#147;I&#146;m NOT!&#148;

Vanessa - &#147;He&#146;s trying to get a job.&#148;

Crystal - &#147;Trying? That&#146;s a laugh! He can&#146;t hold down a job, and he&#146;s 
NOT trying hard enough to try to hold one down either!! I---&#148;

Janice looks him over, turns her head slightly to glance him up and 
down. &#147;Hmmm--- maybe---&#148;

Crystal/A.D. - &#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Nothing. I just had a weird idea that&#146;s all.&#148; (looks up again and 
stares A.D. straight in the eyes) &#147;Level with me. You don&#146;t like being 
in my place do you. Why is little A.D. uncomfortable being in a big 
girl&#146;s place?&#148;

A.D. shifts in his chair abit, not wanting to return her gaze, but 
finally he speaks softly, &#147;Crystal doesn&#146;t like me.&#148;

&#147;Is that it?&#148; (looks at Crystal who nods her head) &#147;Oh. Thought you 
were a homophobic. Never mind, my bad.&#148; (everyone sweat drops at 
Janice&#146;s remarks) &#147;So--- did we ever meet? You know about me? (Y&#146;know, 
just in case---).&#148;

&#147;Crystal told Vanessa---&#148;

&#147;And Vanessa told you. Uh-huh. Well, I&#146;ll leave it at that then.&#148; 
(smirks wider if that was humanly possibly) &#147;So!&#147; (turning her 
attention to Crystal) &#147;Why is little Crystal so up in arms about A.D. 
&amp; Vanessa (sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S---)&#148;

&#147;THAT FUCK GOT MY SISTER HOOKED ON COKE!!&#148;

About at this point Janice goes silent. &#147;Say what---?&#148;

&#147;SHUT UP, CRYSTAL!! IT&#146;S MY LIFE!!&#148;

&#147;HE&#146;S FUCKING YOUR LIFE UP!!&#148;

&#147;YOU DON&#146;T GET IT!! WE&#146;RE HAPPY!! WE LOVE IT!! IT&#146;S FUCKING GOOD 
AND---&#148;

&#147;THE MONEY YOU SPEND ON THE DRUGS!! CAN&#146;T HOLD A JOB!! EVICTIONS FROM 
APARTMENTS!! WHAT&#145;S SO FUCKIN&#145; GOOD ABOUT THAT?!?&#148;

&#147;I NEED A.D.!! HE MAKES ME FEEL GOOD!! I NEED---&#148;

&#147;SHUT UP!!!&#148; Everyone quickly spins towards Janice to notice she left 
the room and came back with a gun. &#147;You did coke in MY apartment? You 
fuckin&#146; insane?!?&#148; (A.D. tries to jump up at her but gets whirled 
aside into a wall and handcuffed fast. Before Vanessa can move the gun 
is shoved into her face)

&#147;J-j-jan? What are you doing?!&#148;

&#147;Vanessa and her boy toy did coke in our bathroom! I went and checked 
and sure enough it looks like they were cutting in there! Damn!&#148; 
(looks at Crystal) &#147;Be a dear and go to my closet, get me the box.&#148;

&#147;Jan! Please! DON&#146;T HURT MY SIS--!!&#148;

Janice quickly pulls Crystal towards her and holds her tight (gun 
pointed away still at Vanessa) &#147;I&#146;m NOT! But you have to trust me! I 
need what&#146;s in my closet! It won&#146;t hurt her! Just go! Please!&#148;

As Crystal reluctantly complies Janice holds Vanessa off, while she 
keeps an eye on A.D. &#147;You think getting coked up is a good high, huh? 
Makes you feel good---&#148; (Crystal returns with the box) &#147;Take the cuffs 
and cuff her, hands behind her back.&#148;

As Crystal reluctantly does it Janice takes out two syringes and a 
drug. As the two start screaming Janice shuts them up with a 
threatening shove of the gun against their heads. As Crystal trembles 
near her she begins to talk. &#147;Last year I ran into an interesting 
fellow with an interesting hobby. A horny chemist. Would you believe 
it? A horny chemist! And you know what he did?&#148; (grabs the two and 
drags them into her room) &#147;He made this neat-o little drug. Simple, 
really, I even have the recipe and the compounds to make it. He used 
it to play party games with little girls---&#148; (drops the two on the 
bed) &#147;---sick little games. But that&#146;s because they were under aged. 
In fact this stuff is quite harmless if taken by consenting lovers, 
and you two seem consenting---&#148; (injects each of them) &#147;Coke has 
nothing over this drug, kiddies, it&#146;s a nice little vice that&#146;ll make 
you want to fuck so badly you&#146;ll do anything to want those cuffs off 
so you can get horny.&#148;

At first the two resist the thoughts of Janice&#146;s pervert drug.

At this time Crystal asks the obvious. &#147;What are you doing?!&#148;

&#147;Teaching them that drugs isn&#146;t as fun as sex.&#148;

&#147;But Jan!!&#148;

&#147;Look, Crissy, you want you sister off coke, right?&#148;

&#147;---&#148;

&#147;Well?&#148;

&#147;---yeah---&#148;

&#147;Then give it time. You&#146;ll see---&#148;

Five minutes later the two are bumping into each other whimpering 
madly.

Ten minutes later they&#146;re sweating, crying for release.

Twenty minutes later A.D. turns over the name of the dope man.

&#147;Alright. Let them go. Little babies earned their fun.&#148; Janice smiles, 
taking the box with her. &#147;Where are you going?&#148;

&#147;Police station. Lock this up. If Vanessa &amp; A.D. want more of the 
liquid fun they have to stay off the smack and get cleaned up.&#148;

&#147;They can&#146;t---&#148;

&#147;Can they? Look---&#148; (the two were already madly fucking like crazy, 
screaming for multiple releases) &#147;---they&#146;re in nirvana now.&#148;

&#147;Janny!!&#148;

&#147;I know, I know. I&#146;ll leave some with you. DON&#146;T take it yourself! 
It&#146;s madly addictive! Just make sure they get the point that they 
behave, they get a treat.&#148;

&#147;Janice---&#148;

Janice takes Crystal in her arms and kisses her, but this time Crystal 
resists. &#147;Don&#146;t resist me. I&#146;m sorry. Look. I didn&#146;t know what else to 
do--- I didn&#146;t want you to be sad anymore, and it only would have been 
bad for us if Johnny came over and found their stuff in our pad. Let 
me handle it. I&#146;ll eventually find a way to detox them (it took awhile 
but those little girls who were hooked got detoxed) but for now they 
need a drug that won&#146;t kill them. It&#146;s shitty, but it&#146;s better than 
coke because my &#147;love&#148; is free as long as they&#146;re good kids. OK?&#148;

Reluctantly Crystal agrees and leaves the healing of her sister to 
Janice.

&#147;Good. Now take the phone in my room and don&#146;t let them call anyone!&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;They might call their dope man and I want him to stay in the dark 
until I catch him, OK? Now stay here, keep the door locked, and don&#146;t 
let anyone in. I have my key so I&#146;ll let myself in, alright?&#148;

&#147;Alright.&#148;

&#147;Good.&#148; (kisses Crystal one more time, this time she returns the kiss) 
&#147;I&#146;ll be right back. Hold the fort.&#148;

&#147;Janny? Be careful.&#148;

&#147;Alright. Keep an eye on those two---&#148; (peeks briefly in) &#147;---though 
you shouldn&#146;t have any trouble with them for half a day at least on 
that dose.&#148;

-----

After locking down the drug kit, Janice quickly grabs Johnson and they 
hit the road on the way to the dealer&#146;s house.

&#147;Janice, I thought we agreed NEVER to use it.&#148;

&#147;It was an emergency and I was pissy, alright? Sue me.&#148; Janice huffs, 
checking her gun again. &#147;This is the place where the guy lives?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. He&#146;s got a direct pipeline into Asia, South America and the 
Middle East for his drugs. Nice guy, just got his priorities mixed up 
majorly.&#148;

&#147;Is he supplying terrorists?&#148;

&#147;In a sense. Any drug purchasing eventually helps support terrorism.&#148; 
(car stops) &#147;We&#146;re here. You take the back and I&#146;ll---&#148; (gunshots) 
&#147;---damn! Better call it---&#148; (Janice jumps out of the car) 
&#147;---JANICE!! WAIT!! JAN!!&#148;

In a few long strides she&#146;s onto the stairway and pounding up the 
stairs. As she hit&#146;s the floor the perp lives on she runs smack dab 
into someone coming out of an apartment. The two collide and spin off 
from each other, Janice landing into the railing overlooking the 
parking lot as the other hit&#146;s the wall. He&#146;s dressed in black, face 
hidden by a gas mask, a rather trim and agile fellow in a Black Ops 
getup. He regards Janice for a second, then sprints right at her, 
jumping over the railing and disappearing down street side. Below she 
hears gunshots as Johnson takes some shots at him, then silence. For 
long seconds nothing then-- &#147;Jan? You OK?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine! Where&#146;s---&#148;

&#147;He took off! Didn&#146;t even wait to exchange fire! He&#146;s gone!&#148;

&#147;Wonder why---&#148; Janice remarks as she walks into the apartment. Inside 
is the makings of a drug lab, with several pounds of coke splattered 
all over the place. The dope man, a tall Middle Eastern descent male, 
lies in his own blood. His prayer calendar has been torn up, a copy of 
the Koran burning in a trash can. On the near wall words---

&#147;KILL ALL OF SATAN&#146;S CHILDREN!!&#148;

Johnson walks in, and gasps. &#147;What the---&#148;

&#147;Better call it in.&#148; Janice remarks glumly, &#147;Looks like we have the 
workings of a either a drug dealer and/or race killer on our hands 
here.&#148; (looks about) &#147;Take your pick.&#148;

-----

While Crystal waits for Janice to return, she paces back and forth in 
the living room nibbling on her nails while her sister and Anthony 
continue their sexual exploits. She contemplates peeking in on them. 
But feels really weird about spying on her big sister getting fucked; 
especially by a guy she can&#39;t stand. The thought sends a slight tingle 
through her body, arousing her. She becomes disgusted at the thought 
of getting excited over the two of them having sex in her apartment.

It doesn&#39;t stop her, however, from creeping into the bedroom, and 
easing the door ajar to take a small peek at the two. She is concerned 
about their welfare, after all. As she slowly pushes the door open, 
she can hear her sister shrieking in pleasure. Another slight push 
allows Crystal to gain an even clearer view of the two, and she gasps 
once she sees Anthony pounding his rod in and out of his sister&#39;s 
dripping wet cunt. Damn! His dick is so big! She thinks, as she 
caresses her protruding nipples.

With her other hand, she cups her crotch, rubbing her partly shaven 
pussy through the thin fabric of her silk shorts. Looking around to 
make sure the coast is clear, she gradually eases her hand into her 
shorts and even further, into her thong panties to stroke her moist 
pussy. She yanks her hand out quickly to taste her nectar, all the 
while wishing Janice was here to satisfy her building desire.

Suddenly she feels a hand enter her and she gasps only to have her 
mouth covered. &#147;Naughty little girl. Mommy &#147;spank&#148;!&#148; Janice coos, 
having slipped into the apartment silently (though out of an awkward 
sense since she didn&#146;t know how to tell A.D. his supplier was probably 
just killed by a racist). As Janice plunges three fingers into 
Crystal, delighting her immensely, the two watch the lovers in action. 
As Anthony continues to stroke Vanessa with his forceful thrusts her 
smooth legs strapped to his massive shoulders, Crystal cries out 
softly as Janice continues to finger fuck her beloved into a soft 
oblivion, her rhythms matching their own. Her sisters&#146; shrieks are so 
loud, she cannot hear her own low moans of pleasure. Janice simply 
leans into Crystal, massaging her breasts as she makes her feel better 
as she watches her sister&#146;s lovemaking. Anthony&#39;s movements increase 
as he finally reaches his climax, causing Janice to sigh as Crystal 
releases her own flowing juices, as she and Vanessa both whimper with 
resounding moans of ecstasy.

Janice then carefully takes Crystal out, closing the door behind them, 
taking Crissy to the couch and lying down with her beneath holding 
Crystal tight. Crystal leans her head against Janice&#146;s breast, a few 
tears rolling down her face as the guilt begins to seep into her 
conscious. She had reverted back to the mode of voyeurism she and Mike 
enjoyed so much long ago, and she doesn&#39;t know just what to make of 
this matter.

&#147;Don&#146;t feel badly.&#148; Janice sighs, rubbing Crystal&#146;s head as she 
comforts her. &#147;With all that sex you couldn&#146;t help yourself. If I was 
here I&#146;d have watched too---&#148; (holds Crystal tight) &#147;---I did once.&#148; 
(Crystal looks at her) &#147;When you were with Mike. I watched you two 
making love once and--- goddess--- I couldn&#146;t help myself. I was so 
turned on watching the woman I loved being fucked by someone else--- 
even a fucked up male like Mike--- I had to do myself. It was wrong, I 
shouldn&#146;t have but---&#148; (looks into Crystal&#146;s eyes) &#147;I couldn&#146;t get you 
out of my mind. It felt so wrong but--- I wished it was me in there 
fucking you. Making you scream and cry out--- making you love me. I 
felt so dirty afterwards I had to watch a lesbian couple make it just 
to feel better but--- goddess, Crissy, I couldn&#146;t help it! You make me 
so crazy I can&#146;t stop loving you!&#148; Seconds later, Janice asks the 
dreaded question. &#147;Your not going back are you? I&#146;d be lonely---&#148;

Crystal shakes her head, smiles, and kisses Janice fully on the lips, 
pulling her clothes off as she does.

&quot;You got me so worked up and excited while I was watching you pleasure 
yourself. Simply &#147;helping&#147; you didn&#145;t do it for me.&quot; Janice coos as 
she slowly removes her tee shirt, then eases out of her faded jeans. 
(&#146;Yeah.&#146; Janice briefly thinks to herself, &#145;The way I&#146;m dressed I must 
have been a threatening presence when that guy confronted me! Heh. 
Probably thought I was a dissatisfied customer.&#146;) &quot;Now, what are you 
gonna do about this horny little girlfriend of yours?&quot; Janice asks, 
smiling widely as she gazes deeply in Crystal&#145;s lovely eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t 
know.&quot; Crystal replies, pulling her own silk top over her head, 
exposing her large brown nipples as they perk out in pure excitement. 
&#147;I hope that&#146;s sarcasm because I--- ump!&#148; Crystal smothers Janice 
underneath her larger form continuing to plant soft, wet kisses upon 
her juicy lips. &#147;Shush.&#148;

Slowly, but surely, she moves down towards Janice&#39;s protruding 
nipples, grasping one in her hand, placing her entire mouth around the 
entire areola and nipple as she sucks it with mad passion. As her 
slurping continues, she grabs onto the other breast and squeezes it 
with a loving embrace. &quot;Let&#39;s see what we can do to rectify that 
situation.&quot; Crystal whispers, as she takes the other breasts into her 
hungry mouth, salivating all over it. Janice becomes completely lost 
in the pleasure zone as Crystal devours her. Crystal gradually works 
her way towards Janice&#39;s soaking cunt, positioning her own pussy over 
Janice&#39;s face. When she is finally in the sixty-nine position, Janice 
grabs both of Crystal&#39;s plump ass cheeks, squeezes them, smacks them 
with a slight pop, then she proceeds to lick Crystal&#39;s dripping wet 
nectar from her own hot little cunt.

In the bedroom, Vanessa stirs from her slumber at the low sounds of 
moans she hears in the living room. She was about to head to the 
bathroom to wash her face, but decides to investigate the source of 
these sounds first. As she sneaks into the living room, she is totally 
surprised to see her little sister engaged in a fierce lovemaking 
session with her equally voracious lover. Vanessa feels a slight 
tingle ripple through her naked form, and without thinking, she starts 
to caress herself. She squeezes both her large breasts in each hand, 
gazing down at them both to notice her nipples beginning to grow as 
she becomes more aroused.

She then moves her hands to her hairy pussy, spreading her lips with 
two of her fingers, while inserting two other fingers into herself 
with her other hand. Her view of the two women is so clear, that she 
cannot believe she can see them so clearly. Anthony is in a deep 
sleep, as usual after a fuck session, so he won&#39;t bother them. Vanessa 
allows herself to think as she continues to insert her two fingers 
into herself, and her juices start to flow from her once again. When 
Janice lets out a slight screech, Vanessa increases her strokes, 
slowly bringing herself to climax. After climaxing, Vanessa eases out 
of the living room and heads towards the bathroom to clean up, while 
Crystal and Janice continue to strongly fuck with such firm and 
voracious vigor, making hot sex to one another as they gain their 
second wind.

It takes awhile for Janice/Crystal to finally wake up, but once they 
do they gather up Vanessa &amp; A.D. and have a rap session with them over 
breakfast.

&#147;Last time you two are screwing in my bed by the way.&#148; Janice huffs 
slightly, tossing the entire bed wash and stuff into her washing 
machine. &#147;I&#146;m just not overtly turned on by male juices on my favorite 
bed sheets! (Knew I should have took my custom Sailor Mercury bedding 
just in case!) You can use the futon in my closet for sex. It&#146;s had 
it&#146;s share of lovers though this is the first time it&#146;s being broken 
in by a male.&#148;

&#147;Of course---&#148; Vanessa gulps, still remembering her little sister&#146;s 
lovemaking exploits and how it turned her on watching them. A.D. 
looked abit nervous. &#147;What about our source? Was he pissed when you 
and the cops broke in?&#148;

&#147;Quite frankly I think your &#147;source&#148; would have been happier if we 
broke in, say, five to ten minutes earlier. He&#146;s dead.&#148;

&#147;Dead?!&#148; A.D. chokes, looking at Janice with a scared look. &#147;W-what? 
Who?!? They know about us? Are we next? Wh--&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s not that simple! Calm down!!&#148; Janice quickly moves back to the 
table to resume eating, the wash machine raging behind her. &#147;From what 
I could see---&#148; (her cell phone rings) &#147;---hold on.&#148; (answers it) 
&#147;Yeah? Yeah it&#146;s me. Uh-huh--- uh-huh--- right. Keep on it, I&#146;ll swing 
by later to chat. Right, bye.&#148; (hangs up phone) &#147;WHAT?!? What did 
he---&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s worst than I thought.&#148; (grabs controller and turns on TV) 
&#147;---now what channel did he say it&#146;ll be on--- there we go.&#148;

&#147;---third such killing in several days. The first two seemingly 
unconnected, just like the recent murder. One was a shop owner, the 
other a journalist, this one a known drug dealer. Again, police are 
looking for anyone with any information leading to the arrest of an 
unknown serial killer targeting males of middle eastern descent.&#148; 
(Janice turns off TV, turning her gaze to A.D.) &#147;I thought his drug 
dealing might have killed him, but after pondering it (and that call 
from Johnson) it makes sense. The racial slurs scrawled in the 
apartment, the vicious way the murder took place, the sense of rage. I 
say there&#146;s a racist in town and he&#146;s blowing away anyone whose middle 
eastern by birth.&#148;

Vanessa &amp; A.D. didn&#146;t look too happy with that.

And Janice knew as the questioning continued their mood wouldn&#146;t 
improve.
