<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 22 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><pre>Cherilyn lay upon her bed with her hands behind her head as she stared 
at the ceiling. She felt as if her entire world had dissolved around 
her, she always thought her greatest fear was the Western Wing. With its 
vine covered brick walls and large dark windows that made the build look 
more like a dissolute haunted house then a school, the dorms were not 
much better. Since she first saw the building when she was only ten 
years of age she had nightmares of it swallowing her alive. Yet as she 
lay upon her bed she realized there was something she feared more then 
that building and it was losing Tanya. 					

She was twelve when she met Tanya for the first time, at the time she 
was just another of her dorm mates and spent much of her time with Jenn. 
Back then Cherilyn did not have many friends, she spent much of her time 
alone and would eat her lunch on a bench out front of the school, being 
sure to stay on the Eastern side of the academy grounds. Never really 
talking to anyone much, not even her roommates. That is until Tanya 
approached her and asked if it was all right for herself, Kris and Jenn 
to join Cherilyn for lunch on the bench. Whether it was because there 
was no were else better to sit or because Tanya truly wanted to get to 
know Cherilyn, she will never know, however she quickly became friends 
with both girls and this encounter helped Cherilyn open up a lot more to 
the other kids in the dorm.

Cherilyn could not remember when she first noticed her heart being 
pulled towards Tanya. At first it was only a small crush but she knew 
that Tanya had a huge crush on Jenn. The fact that Jenn was deeply in 
love with Kris gave Cherilyn a slight comfort in knowing that she would 
not be losing her new friend to another so easily. She would sometimes 
watch Jenn and Kris curled up under a tree, giggling and laughing, and 
wished she could do the same with Tanya. However as Cherilyn&#39;s feelings 
for the girl grew she could feel the Western Wing looming ever so much 
closer. This made her fear confessing to the girl, terrified that she 
would end up transferred to that infernal building that is until the 
other day. Was it a mistake to confess her love to Tanya, to kiss her 
like that? Did Cherilyn doom herself the moment she gave in to her 
desires? Whatever the reason, Tanya ran into the woods that night and 
for the first time Cherilyn realized that she could not live without the 
girl. She had no right blaming Tanya for her running off for it was her 
decision to go after her friend. She knew very well that by entering 
those woods she was testing fate and fate has told her that she is to 
stay at Tanya&#39;s side, even if it is in that accursed dorm. 

Cherilyn sat up on her bed and scanned the pile of flattened boxes that 
had been left for her by the Eastern Dorm head before everyone ran off 
to school. A sudden determined strength filled Cherilyn&#39;s heart and she 
crossed the room to pick up one of the boxes and unfolded it. If fate 
was telling her that she belonged with Tanya then maybe she should stop 
fighting it. She was beginning to fill the box with her textbooks and 
thought over how she would apologize to Tanya for the nasty things she 
said.

&quot;Need any help?&quot; Someone asked from the door. 

Cherilyn spun around to see Jenn standing at the door looking at the 
pile of boxes, &quot;Jennifer?!?&quot; She was startled to see the girl standing 
before her. 

Jenn entered the room and picked up one of the boxes, &quot;Tanya told me 
that you were upset over the move so I came to see if I could help out 
only to find you already packing.&quot; Jenn stated with a bewildered look 
upon her face. 

Cherilyn lowered her head and turning back to her packing, &quot;How much did 
she tell you?&quot; She inquired, fearful of the answer. 

&quot;Only that you think that we are perverted and disgusting vampires that 
are out to suck your soul.&quot; Jenn remarked coolly, unfolding the box and 
setting it on Cherilyn&#39;s bed then glaring at the girl.

&quot;I never said you were Vampires!&quot; Cherilyn protested staring at the girl 
in shock that Jenn would even believe that she would say such a thing.

&quot;So you do think we are perverted and disgusting?&quot; Jenn inquired still 
eyeing the girl. 

Cherilyn dropped more the books the box and sighed, &quot;I wish I never 
opened my mouth.&quot; Cherilyn replied dismally, &quot;You all probably hates me 
now. Tanya the most.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m used to being insulted. Tanya, however is hurt, that is for sure.&quot; 
Jenn sat upon the bed and glanced around the room, &quot;These rooms don&#39;t 
look much different from ours in the Western Dorms. What is it you are 
so afraid of?&quot; She inquired, eager to help her friend get over her fear 
of the Western side of the grounds. 

&quot;You saw the woods.&quot; Cherilyn replied shakily as she recalled the 
nightmares within, &quot;I keep having nightmares that that side of the 
school is just like the woods, filled with unknown creatures and 
nightmarish things. I&#39;ve even heard that ghosts live within the halls of 
the Western Dorms.&quot; She opened a desk draw and began added the contents 
to the box. 

&quot;Not that I&#39;ve seen.&quot; Jenn thought for a moment and decided not to 
mention Kima. She eyed the girl&#39;s packing, &quot;So tell me, if you are so 
set on not going to the West Wing then why are you packing?&quot; 

Cherilyn stopped what she was doing and set a hand upon the corner of 
the box, &quot;Because I can&#39;t live without her.&quot; Cherilyn remarked 
helplessly, &quot;If she is determined to move to that place then I will 
follow. It will be fine as long as I&#39;m with her.&quot; 

&quot;That is good to hear.&quot; Tanya announced from the door, &quot;Because I got us 
a room together.&quot; She stated with a weak smile. 

Cherilyn turned to face her friend with a dumbfounded expression upon 
her face, &quot;You what?&quot; Cherilyn stared at Tanya in disbelief, &quot;But why?&quot; 
She asked perplexed by what she was hearing. 

&quot;Because I knew you would not want to room with anyone else.&quot; Tanya 
remarked gloomily, &quot;and...because... I need you too.&quot; She finally 
admitted. 

Cherilyn staggered across the room, tears pooling up in her eyes, &quot;Oh 
Tanya!!&quot; She wrapped her arms around the girl and hugged her tightly, &quot;I 
thought I&#39;d lost you for sure.&quot; She stated with a sob, &quot;I... I&#39;ve loved 
you for so long... and just... just when I get up the strength to tell 
you... you ran off on me.&quot; Cherilyn stammered, &quot;Don&#39;t ever leave me 
again.&quot; She demanded.

&quot;Never.&quot; Tanya promised and returned the hug then pulled back, &quot;Let&#39;s 
get packed and go to our new home.&quot; 

Cherilyn nodded while wiping at her tears, &quot;I&#39;ll go anywhere with you.&quot; 
She remarked with a smile.

Jenn grinned at the two girls as she watched them hug each other again 
before gathering up some boxes and started discussing what should be 
packed first. Maybe Natalie was wrong and there can happy endings at 
Whispering Hills Jenn thought to herself, just maybe. 

&quot;Are you going to just sit there smiling at us or are you going to 
help?&quot; Tanya requested, tossing a box at her friend, who caught it. 

&quot;Where can I help?&quot; Jenn requested spinning the box between her hands 
and joined in the packing.
