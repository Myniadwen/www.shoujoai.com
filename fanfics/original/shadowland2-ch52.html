<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 52 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch51.html">Back to Part 51</a><pre>Kim curled up on the bed next to Penny in a nightshirt that she found in 
her suitcase, she still had no memory of bringing the case with her and 
yet it seemed to be filled with many of her own clothes. She decided not 
to worry too much about it and tried to concentrate on the book in her 
hand. After a time she found that her mind would not focus on the words 
before her so she closed her book on her index finger and watched the 
girls as one by one they drifted off to sleep. Sarah had already crawled 
up on the top bunk while Amber lay on the mattress on the ground with an 
arm protectively around April while Caitlin had made a bed from the pile 
of clothes in the closet and was now curled up deep in the corner. And 
lastly, Penny snuggled up close beside Kim, not leaving her side. 

Kim smiled happily, never before had she felt like she belong somewhere, 
here she had many sisters and although it was crowded she found her new 
home cozy and somewhat of a comfort. Before she always felt as if she 
was running from something, as if she had no place to call home. Now she 
felt as if she finally found her home. She felt Penny&#39;s arm move around 
her waist and turned to look at the girl. 

Penny gave a small, weak smile, &quot;How are you doing?&quot; She inquired 
softly.

&quot;Alright,&quot; Kim waved the book she was reading, &quot;I&#39;m just about caught 
up.&quot; She replied with a smile, &quot;How about you?&quot; 

Penny nuzzled into Kim, &quot;Better now that you are here.&quot; She said with a 
sigh and squeezed Kim. 

Kim set the book on the ground and moved closer to Penny before flipping 
off the light attached to the bedpost. The moment the light was out 
Amber&#39;s eyes flickered open. 

&quot;You finished reading?&quot; She inquired in but a whisper, as to not wake 
the others. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Kim replied, peering over the edge of the bed, &quot;I&#39;ll 
finish the rest in the morning.&quot; She said softly, &quot;It shouldn&#39;t take too 
long.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Amber admitted with a smile that turned to a frown, &quot;Are you 
finding the story creepy?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t like that nurse.&quot; Kim remarked in distaste.

&quot;She reminds me of Ma&#39;am.&quot; Amber stated miserably. 

Kim shook her head, &quot;Ma&#39;am is not that bad.&quot; She remarked, &quot;My father 
was much worse, trust me.&quot; 

&quot;You will change your mind soon enough.&quot; Amber assured, &quot;You should try 
to get some sleep.&quot; 

&quot;Alright&quot; Kim curled up under the blankets and pulled Penny in close, 
&quot;Night Amber.&quot; 

&quot;Night&quot;

&quot;Sweet dreams, Penny.&quot; Kim said to the girl in her arms. 

Penny frowned sadly, &quot;Not likely.&quot; She replied with another sigh. 

&quot;Try to get some sleep.&quot; Kim soothingly suggested, &quot;I&#39;ll watch over you 
and protect you.&quot; 

Penny&#39;s eyes glistened in the night, &quot;And who will protect you?&quot; She 
inquired worriedly. 

Kim placed a hand gently upon Penny&#39;s cheek and gazed into the girl&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. I can handle myself.&quot; She tried to reassure 
the girl.

Penny shook her head, &quot;I can&#39;t help it.&quot; She stated, her eyes darting 
around the room, &quot;The night always makes me nervous.&quot; 

Kim smiled tenderly, &quot;Maybe I can help.&quot; She offered lightly stroking 
the girl&#39;s cheek. 

Penny nuzzled up to Kim hand at first then pulled away, &quot;W... we... 
can&#39;t...&quot; She stammered, her eyes flicking wildly about the room as if 
in search for someone watching them. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; Kim leaned forward and lightly brushed her lips against 
Penny&#39;s. 

&quot;Kim...&quot; Penny let out a shivered sigh and was about to kiss the girl 
when the sounds of foot steps interrupted them, &quot;N... no...&quot; Penny 
stammered, huddling into Kim as they silently watching the door. 

&quot;Please don&#39;t come in here.&quot; Amber softly prayed and held April close to 
herself. They heard the lock on the door unlatch and the girls froze.

&quot;I wish Jessie were here.&quot; Penny whispered squeezing Kim tight. 

&quot;I&#39;ll protect you.&quot; Kim hugged Penny in return and watched the door, 
finding it impossible to turn away. She could feel the terror from her 
sisters fill the room and she feared what may be behind that door. The 
door slowly opened a crack and a set of dirty fingers snaked around the 
edge of the door. &quot;You girls should be sleeping.&quot; Came a hissing from 
behind the door. The sound was low and gurgled, almost like that of a 
lizard.  Kim almost wished it were a lizard because that she could 
handle, however as the door opened more it reveal the shadowy form of a 
tall, thin man, his dark eyes quickly scanning the room in search of who 
was not sleeping. They came across Kim and she felt as if his eyes were 
crawling over her skin. A streetlight shone through the window lighting 
up his teeth as a grin broke out across his face. 

&quot;Do you see that new girl?&quot; Another man with a slightly husky voice 
inquired as he entered the room behind his brother. This second man was 
larger then his brother and looked a lot stronger.

&quot;Yep.&quot; He stated as he entered the room and started towards Kim and 
Penny. He suddenly stopped as if something startled him and stared at 
Penny as she clung to Kim&#39;s arm. &quot;It seems our Penny has become quite 
attached to the new girl.&quot; He remarked with delight. His smile broadened 
at the sight of the two girls. A smile that made Kim&#39;s stomach sink. She 
knew that grin all too well and knew exactly what these men were after.

The large man looked down at the girls, &quot;Maybe she will finally be a 
good girl.&quot; He said anxiously.

&quot;What do you think Penny?&quot; The tall man inquired, &quot;Will you be a good 
girl for us today?&quot; 

Penny shrank into Kim, &quot;Don&#39;t you hurt her!&quot; Kim snarled, baring her 
teeth at the men like an animal. 

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you a feisty one?&quot; The large man commented with a chuckle. 

&quot;We aren&#39;t going to hurt her.&quot; The tall man assured, &quot;We just want you 
two to come with us for a moment.&quot; He reached out one of his long arms 
towards Kim and offered her his hand, &quot;Will you come with us?&quot; He 
coaxed. &quot;We have a treat for you.&quot;

Penny held Kim&#39;s arm tight, &quot;Don&#39;t go.&quot; She pleaded to the girl.

Kim glanced at Penny to see the dread in her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m not going 
anywhere.&quot; She assured confidently when the man suddenly grabbed her by 
the arm. 

&quot;I told you to come here.&quot; He snarled angrily and pulled Kim off the bed 
while the other man grabbed for Penny.

&quot;You come when you are told.&quot; The big man demanded as he hauled Penny 
out of the bed. 

&quot;OWWW!!&quot; Kim cried out as the thin man twisted her arm, &quot;You&#39;re hurting 
me.&quot; 

&quot;Shut up!&quot; The other man snapped, &quot;You don&#39;t want to wake up mother now 
do you?&quot; He inquired with a sly grin. &quot;If you do we&#39;ll tell her how much 
of a bad girl you have been and she&#39;ll send you to the cellar.&quot;

Panic washed over Kim&#39;s mind as she was dragged across the floor. She 
glanced around the room in search of someone to help her only to see 
frightened eyes staring back at her. Amber&#39;s eyes were filled with tears 
as she shook her head slowly and mouthed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; before the man 
closed the door and relocked it.

The larger man fiddled with a ring of keys with one hand while holding 
Penny over his shoulder. He quickly moved down the hall until he came to 
the last door in the hall and hastily he put one of the keys in the door 
and twisted it, then pushed the door open for his brother, &quot;After you.&quot; 
He gestured with a grin. 

The thin man shoved Kim into the room. It was a large pink bedroom with 
a large canopy bed in the corner and several stuffed animals spread 
across the pink bed spread. The rest of the room was nearly bare aside 
from a dark wooden dresser in the far corner and dark curtains that hung 
heavily over the windows blocking out any light from outside. The only 
source of light were two cone shaded lamped with their lights trained 
upon the bed. Kim scanned the room in bewilderment when she heard the 
door closed behind her and the distinct sound of the door locking. She 
spun around to see the large man pocket the keys while the thin one 
crossed the room to the dresser where he proceeded to pull out a camera 
from the top draw and load it with film.

&quot;Sit on the bed.&quot; The large man ordered in his husky voice then dropped 
Penny upon the bed.

Kim rushed over to the bed and hugged Penny who pulled away, hiding in 
the corner of the bed amongst the stuffed animals. Kim turned her angry 
eyes to the men only to discover she could not see them with the bright 
light trained on her, they were too bright and swallowed the rest of the 
room in darkness, making it only possible to see the men&#39;s shadows as 
they moved about the room, &quot;What are you going to do to us?&quot; She 
inquired uneasily, her mind filled with the many things her father 
forced her to do and terror overflowed her as she realized that these 
two might order her to do the same.

&quot;Just get on the bed like a good girl.&quot; The man repeated, &quot;If you don&#39;t 
do what we ask then you can spend the day in the basement tomorrow 
without anything to eat.&quot; 

The other man scuffled around the room, &quot;I hear there are a lot of bugs 
down there.&quot; He stated with a laugh, &quot;So listen to us and you won&#39;t be 
hurt, alright?&quot;

&quot;Those clothes don&#39;t work.&quot; One of the men stated, referring to Kim&#39;s 
long nightshirt with a print of kittens on the front.

&quot;I think it is cute on her.&quot; The other retorted, &quot;The shirt captures her 
innocence.&quot;   

Kim watched as one of the shadows moved in closer and there was a sudden 
flash followed by a winding sound. She blinked as spots flickered before 
her eyes. 

There was another flash, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; 

Another flash, &quot;Ummm... what is your name?&quot; 

&quot;K... Kimberly...&quot; Kim stammered frightened of what the men were 
planning in the shadows. 

&quot;Kim could you pick up one of the stuffed animals and hug it.&quot; He 
inquired, &quot;The big pink one next to Penny.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; She inquired confused by the request. 

&quot;Just do as your told.&quot; One of them men snapped. Kim cringed against the 
sound and did as she was requested, picking up a large pink stuffed bear 
and hugging it in her arms. Yet another flash, &quot;I think she will do just 
fine.&quot; 

Flash

&quot;Kimberly, would you take off your nightshirt.&quot; 

Kim was startled by this new request and hugged the bear tightly, &quot;My 
shirt?&quot; The request made her feel uneasy and she glanced at Penny who 
huddled into the corner, tears filling her eyes, &quot;I... If I do w... Will 
you not touch Penny?&quot; She inquired hopefully. 

Chuckles filled the room, &quot;Sure, just take it off. Slowly.&quot;

Kim&#39;s thoughts raced through her head. What would these men do if she 
did not comply with their demands? Would they simply send her to the 
basement without food as they suggested? Or would they instead move to 
Penny? She thought of them touching Penny, their rough hands moving over 
her soft skin and she shuddered. Her father had done far worse to her 
and she could handle the pain and the humiliation, but Penny was so 
innocent. She could not allow them to touch her. If it would save Penny 
then she would do anything.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me come over there and take it off for you.&quot; 

Kim&#39;s was jolted out of her thoughts, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She put the 
teddy off to the side and began to pull her shirt off. As she did she 
could see the flash of a camera go off a in a frenzy of flickers. 
Several times she hesitated as if caught in the camera&#39;s flash like a 
deer in headlights. She finally pulled the shirt over her head and held 
it close to her chest. She felt vulnerable sitting under the lights in 
only her panties and hoped that this would be the extent of her torture, 
but knew there would be more before the night was done, there always 
was. 

&quot;Good girl.&quot; She could hear the smile upon the man&#39;s voice, &quot;Now lay 
back on the bed.&quot; Again Kim did as she was told, lying out on the bed 
with her hands over her chest. More flashes came from the shadows and 
Kim was beginning to feel as if a million eyes were crawling over her 
body causing her to shudder. 

&quot;Penny, remove your clothes.&quot; He ordered. 

Kim quickly sat up, &quot;You said you would leave her alone.&quot; She exclaimed 
frantically. 

&quot;I said I was not going to touch her.&quot; He stated with a smile, &quot;You, 
however, are.&quot; 

&quot;ME?!?&quot; Kim tried to figure out what they were implying. They couldn&#39;t 
mean what she thought they meant could they?

&quot;Now Penny, be a good girl this time.&quot; He ordered the girl.

Penny nodded and sobbed sloftly as stripped off her nightgown, her pale 
skin shining in the gleaming lights. 

&quot;Now lay next to your friend.&quot; 

Kim watched in bewildered curiosity as Penny curled up next to her, 
&quot;Penny?&quot; She wrapped her arms around Penny and held her protectively. 

&quot;Now that is cute.&quot; The voice cooed. &quot;Kimberly, why don&#39;t you give her a 
kiss?&quot; 

&quot;A kiss?&quot; Kim was confused by this new demand. She glanced at Penny and 
searched the girl&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;On the lips.&quot; He demanded.

&quot;What?&quot; Kim glanced out at the shadows. Why would they want her to kiss 
Penny? What could they get out of her kissing Penny? 

&quot;Just do as your told.&quot; The man ordered angrily.

Kim stared into Penny&#39;s eyes; there was panic in those eyes. She saw 
Penny take in a deep shaky breath and nod, &quot;Please.&quot; She whispered, &quot;Do 
as they say or they will hurt you.&quot; 

&quot;But Penny?&quot; Kim felt confusion fill her heart, &quot;What about you?&quot; She 
did not want to hurt the girl no matter what the situation.  

&quot;Kimberly?&quot; The man was getting irritated, &quot;If you do not kiss her I&#39;ll 
let Jim have his way with her. How does that sound to you?&quot; 

Kim stared into the dark in revolution, so that was their game. 
Terrified of that man touching Penny she leaned in close and lightly 
kissed Penny. She could see flashes of light from the shadows and closed 
her own eyes against them. She imagined them back at the ball, gliding 
across the marble floor locked in the embrace of a loving kiss. Then she 
felt Penny deepen the kiss, she allowed herself to fall into the depths 
of Penny&#39;s lips. She opened her mouth and feel their saliva mix together 
in warm waves. The nightmare around her completely forgotten, but not 
for very long as the voice cut through their daydream. 

&quot;Touch her.&quot; 

Kim caressed Penny&#39;s cheek as she let go of the kiss and gazed at her 
friend. Penny let out of shivered sigh as they parted and her lips 
quivered, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Kim whispered low enough to only be heard 
by Penny. 

Penny shakily nodded, &quot;As long as I&#39;m with you.&quot; She stated with a deep 
flush.

&quot;I will not hurt you.&quot; Kim promised as she pulled Penny in close to hug 
her, &quot;And I will not let them hurt you, ever.&quot; 

&quot;Pet her crotch.&quot; The voice suddenly demanded. 

This command make Kim jump in surprise and stare out into the darkness 
in bewilderment, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Touch her cunt.&quot; The person reiterated, &quot;You know exactly what I mean. 
I can see it in your eyes.&quot; 

&quot;I....&quot; Kim glanced down at Penny, &quot;I...&quot; She found herself lost for 
words. Her lips trembles as her eyes began to water, &quot;I... c...can&#39;t...&quot; 

Penny took Kim&#39;s hand and guided it down her body, &quot;If it is you...&quot; She 
whispered with tears in her eyes. 

Kim slowly shook her head as she allowed her fingers to move between the 
girl&#39;s legs. Tears gathered at the edge of her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She 
buried her face into Penny&#39;s shoulder and sobbed, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She 
allowed her fingers to move under the Penny&#39;s panties and let out a weak 
cry of defeat.
