Golgotha.

The seventh planet of the Augusta Star System. And forever seen as a 
forbidden domain. Even in the greatest case, this planet was only 
recognized under the sphere of the Galactic Confederacy&#39;s influence 
because of its tremendous size with comparison to the other planets of 
the system. Beyond its size it was seen as nothing more than a cursed 
sphere. Golgotha was completely covered over with ice. Because of its 
distance from the mother sun of Augustine space, Calpernia, the 
atmosphere was thick with nitrogen. The only reason it was even possible 
to breathe on the planet was because of the nanomachine fields 
constructed for each planet of the &#39;outer&#39; areas of the Augusta Star 
System. For this reason Golgotha was held to be no more than an 
oversized research laboratory. It was possessed of no more than two 
large continents; one to the south of the equator (Aragaia) and one to 
the north of it (Metagaia).  

A certain operation was being conducted on the northern most tip of 
Aragaia.

The frosty fields of pure ice and rock were as much and as far as the 
eye could see. Snow dropped down from the dark skies above, illuminated 
only by the light of Golgotha&#39;s nine moons and the aurora trails that 
adorned those same skies. No animals nor plants were able to grow here. 
But there were signs of life Life that had come from another planet of 
which human life was a given. Suddenly in the distance blazed two 
lights. Along with the echoing sound of exhaust. The cause of the noise 
and light made themselves known mere moments later on. Two bipedal 
humanoid mechanisms, zooming through the chilled Golgotha sky, sleek and 
powerful, framed in white and blue descended towards a certain patch of 
the ice fields. Across the chest plates of the mechas were the branding 
of a certain symbol. That of a golden crucifix, emblazoned with the 
letter &#39;M&#39; at its centre. Machines such as these were called Magi 
Armours. These types were known as the Kishar. There were not military 
grade, so spoken by the lack of weaponry other than a mere set of 
shoulder-concealed sub rifle barrels The Kishar-types were made for one 
purpose only. Excavation. They were the product of years upon years of 
ground-breaking work in the field of archaeological technology Now two 
of those machines would be put to use. The pilot of Kishar #1 grunted 
from inside the cockpit of his Kishar, and opening up communications 
with his partner by tapping a few buttons on the control panel before 
him. A holographic display suddenly popped up over that panel to display 
that secondary pilot.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Pilot #1 spoke, &quot;You getting tired, boy?&quot;

&quot;A little. It&#39;s been pretty hard since we left for Golgotha,&quot; Pilot #2 
replied, &quot;We&#39;ve been up all night getting here remember? And it took me 
days to configure my preferred settings to the specs of this thing.&quot;

Pilot #1 chuckled. &quot;You kids today. A little hard work can refresh the 
soul. Or so I&#39;m told.&quot;

&quot;So what are we here for again?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be dense. You&#39;ve been given the data. After the scrolls were 
found our entire department was in sheer uproar. I can&#39;t understand the 
need for something as old as this... but... we can only follow the 
Ministry&#39;s orders like we always do. I&#39;m not saying I understand the 
panic... it&#39;s not as if they were the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves, 
but... that&#39;s how it is.&quot;

Pilot #2 sighed. &quot;I had heard that the brunt of this operation was 
financed by Esdraelon Conglomerate. Do you think that there&#39;s some truth 
to that?&quot;

&quot;If it is true... then it would explain why the hardliners of the 
Ministry pushed up the excavation schedule. You know those suit-wearing 
bastards don&#39;t care anything for science. They only want money But I 
don&#39;t think we&#39;ll have to wait too long for a result. I&#39;ve heard that 
President Bardia himself has become quite sickly in recent months.&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; Pilot #2 laughed at that, &quot;begging your pardon, but 
don&#39;t be cocky, sir Apparently his son is quite the little apprentice. 
He may just take over his Father&#39;s empire once the old man croaks. And I 
doubt that it would make a difference in the long run. Now that the 
Galactic Confederacy has come to rely on the Esdraelon Conglomerate 
financially... the Ministry can&#39;t help but cooperate with them.&quot;

Pilot #1 shook his head. &quot;That may be so... but this is a secret 
operation, correct? How exactly would this be seen as a collective 
venture when the Galactic Confederacy knows absolutely nothing about 
it?&quot;

&quot;You sound sceptical.&quot;

&quot;Is there any reason I shouldn&#39;t be?&quot; Pilot 1# said, &quot;don&#39;t for a second 
question my loyalty to the Ministry, but... even the planning and design 
of Deuteronomy and the Zarathustra haven&#39;t been hidden from the eyes of 
the Tsar and the other leaders of the Galactic Confederacy I know for a 
fact that the leaders received the memo about them. And the Ministry 
haven&#39;t done much in concealing the scrolls, either. Don&#39;t you find it 
odd that this of all things is being held top secret?&quot;

&quot;I suppose so...&quot; Trailed Pilot  #2.

The older one smiled again. &quot;Perhaps this is all just the ramblings of a 
veteran archaeologist. Forget about it.&quot;

The pilot of the second Kishar nodded and shut off the visual link 
between the two of them It was time to do what they had come here for 
anyway. The two Magi Armours flew down towards a specific set of 
coordinates that had been marked on there visual screens. Below them on 
the icy ground, surrounded by snow of sub-Kelvin temperatures, was 
something that just didn&#39;t seem to fit in with the rest of this planet. 
It was clearly a man-made structure. It was a long paving of stone which 
had been fixed into the side of an ice hillock. The stone frame was 
carved with many intricate and curved symbols and extended beyond a 
length of twenty metres across and seven meters upwards. They might have 
made a normal human seem small in comparison, but the Kishar-types 
towered over it at heights of more than eighty metres. Both MAs landed 
on the cold hoarfrost before the stone tablet fixed into the ice 
hillock.

Pilot #2 addressed his superior with sound-only communication. &quot;Is this 
it? Is this the site?&quot;

&quot;So it is,&quot; Pilot #1 replied, &quot;the recon team finally got off their 
asses and did something right for a change. There is absolutely no 
doubting it. This edifice is nothing like the fake tombs we&#39;ve seen on 
the other side of Golgotha. These carvings are of genuine Mu 
Civilization production. I can vouch for that myself.&quot;

&quot;I see. So we&#39;ve found it,&quot; Pilot #2 confirmed, &quot;the Tomb of Mahalah...&quot;

3999 AB - Present day

**********

&quot;Lieutenant Gestalt. It is time to wake up.&quot;

Ash moaned tiredly to himself at the irritating sound of a robotic 
female voice calling at him. The youngster sighed and rolled over in his 
bed, grabbing the pillow and placing it above his head. A metallic hand 
came down and grabbed the pillow from him; causing another groan of 
irritation. It looked like it was going to be impossible to prevent 
himself from getting more sleep. Ash let off a final groan and rubbed 
the matter from his eyes. Moments later he turned around in the bed and 
leaned upwards, revealing his lean and muscled upper body from the folds 
of his bedspread. He was fairly well built for someone only seventeen 
years of age. 

&quot;Goddamn,&quot; Ash muttered, &quot;You&#39;re pretty handy as an alarm clock, 
Cinnamon.&quot;

Standing beside Ash&#39;s bed was a certain android of feminine proportions 
She was a model of the old 300-Xi series that had been mass-produced on 
planet Shem years ago. But she had been remodelled quite a bit from her 
peers. Her whole body had been covered over with plastics to give off 
the impression of skin, although it was quite clear that she was a 
purely mechanical creation, given her robotic voice. Cinnamon adjusted 
the folds over her dark green military uniform and addressed Ash, 
saying,

&quot;Good Morning, Lieutenant Gestalt. Did you sleep well?&quot;

&quot;I was, until you came along,&quot; Ash eyed the android, &quot;And would you stop 
calling me that when we&#39;re in private, goddamnit? It&#39;s Ash, remember? I 
told you to start thinking of me as a friend.&quot;

Cinnamon shook her head. &quot;That is not possible. You are Lieutenant 
Ashriel Gestalt of the Darshana Division of the Rehoboam Regular 
Military -- aligned to the starship Paracelsus and existing specifically 
for the purpose of Anti-Saviour operations in Augustine Space. I am 
required to provide for you as a superior and the prime field combatant 
of the Darshana Division. I am not programmed to impart you with 
friendship.&quot;

Ash chuckled at that. &quot;Heh. That&#39;s pretty cold. Dah well. I suppose I 
can&#39;t bend the will of the maker, right? If anything you might as well 
just give me the 411. Are we at Protea, yet?&quot;

&quot;Negative,&quot; Replied Cinnamon, &quot;the Paracelsus is currently heading for 
the city of Protea at a speed of 2.6 Giga Thrust. However Commander 
Eldiah has ordered you; along with Lieutenants Stenzel and Daitokuji, to 
meet him in the conference room of the ship. The mission briefing has 
been supplied to us from headquarters. You are required to leave for the 
conference room as soon as possible for the briefing.&quot;

&quot;Finally!&quot; The Germanic teenager jumped out of bed in nothing more than 
his boxers and stepped down onto the comfortable, carpeted floor of his 
dorm room, &quot;General Schwartz has been making us dangle all this time, I 
was half worried that he was going to recall us to Crux Cartha. Finally 
I&#39;ll get myself some action.&quot;

Thereafter Ash wasted no time and marched over to the right of his dorm, 
past the plastic sound-proof window of the side wall. It gave a 
wonderful view of the snowy-ridden grass fields of Rehoboam, the sixth 
planet of the Augusta Star System. The boy marched into the side 
compartment which was actually a kind of bathroom. He stepped behind a 
glass panel and commanded &#39;hot shower - on&#39;. When he closed the panel 
door behind him a stream of warm water poured from the overhead nozzle 
in rivets. Warm water began pouring down the ridges of muscle that 
framed his chest and abdomen, dampening his dark sand blonde hair. While 
Ash reached for a bottle of shampoo on the side he called out to 
Cinnamon and said;

&quot;That&#39;ll be all for now! You can go call on Cream and Yoko.&quot;

Cinnamon shook her head. &quot;They are already awake.&quot;

 &quot;...Oh. Then... you might as well go to the conference room and wait 
for me with the others. Okay?&quot;

&quot;Very well.&quot; Replied the android. 

Cinnamon excused herself and exited through the automatic door of Ash&#39;s 
private dorm. The blonde man spent the next twenty minutes enjoying his 
shower after that. He hadn&#39;t seen much action in recent weeks but he was 
pumped for it now. This unholy war with the Saviours had been sucking up 
a lot of the Galactic Confederacy&#39;s attention recently. But that was to 
be expected. After all, before 3982 AB, not a single person had even 
known of their existence. In that year, the planet Rehoboam, which 
happened to be the chief planet of the Galactic Confederacy, had been 
overcome with an event that was to go down in history as the Saviour 
Invasion. They were a group of biotechnological alien forces which 
attacked the three major cities (Agnus Dei, Crux Cartha, and Ladeny) of 
Rehoboam one by one. They have the power to understand and replicate 
human speech, but even now at a time more than seventeen years after 
their first attack, no one knew just what their intentions were. They 
seemed to attack randomly nowadays. And those attacks were no longer 
centred on just Rehoboam. Other planets in Augustine space, like 
Alvastian and Shem, were beginning to suffer their evil. The Darshana 
Division, the section of the military to which Ash belonged, was one of 
many new platoons being created specifically to deal with the Saviour 
Invasion. After spending as much time as he possibly could in the 
shower, Ash called for the water to be switched off. Then stepped out of 
it and wrapped his naked flesh in a towel. He stepped back out of the 
side compartment and got himself dressed in the dark green and gold 
military uniform. With that the young man exited from his dorm and 
walked out into the corridor that linked up all the dorm rooms on the 
Paracelsus. There were 300 in all. The ship could hold an absolute 
maximum of about 900 people. But the actual number of crew members on 
board now was around 57. That might have seemed like a small number for 
a starship so big, but the Darshana Division was still in its fledgling 
stages. Time had to be given for it to grow. Ash yawned and strode down 
the length corridor, on occasion looking out to the snowy fields of 
Rehoboam through the elongated windows. But he continued to the north of 
the passage and stood before a lift. Ash tapped a button on the control 
panel beside it on the wall and the steel doors opened for him. He 
walked in an pressed another button on the inside to take him to the 
second floor of the ship. The one below the Bridge deck but above the 
dorms When the doors opened again he stepped out into the main corridor 
of the second level. Ash marched down this one, greeting some of the odd 
Darshana operatives he happened to come across along the way, until he 
reached a door marked &#39;conference room&#39;. The automatic doors of the room 
opened form him and he walked in. A large room with a long oval-shaped 
table in its centre. Waiting for him there, as per Cinnamon&#39;s 
statements, were his two field partners as well as Cinnamon herself.

Kathleen &#39;Cream&#39; Stenzel and Yoko Daitokuji.

Kathleen (or &#39;Cream&#39; as everyone called her) was an eager young recruit 
from Shem, the merchant planet. Ash actually liked her a lot. She was 
very bubbly and vibrant, often improving the tone of a grim situation 
with her unfailing (and some might say blind) optimism. And to her right 
was Yoko Daitokuji. A woman of twenty years and the complete opposite of 
Cream. Someone that Ash found it hard to tolerate, let alone work with. 
Though Yoko was born on Rehoboam just like Ash was, she was of Asiatic 
descent, clearly of a bloodline stemming from Planet Noh, a far off orb 
located in the Aradia Star System. Unlike most of the crew of the 
Paracelsus, her reason for being here was purely for sentimental 
purposes. As cold and distant as Yoko acted, she had a terrible hatred 
for the Saviours for reasons she had not yet explained. 

It was hard to find two people so very different from each other. But 
that little detail didn&#39;t matter to Cream. The sixteen-year-old redhead 
stared hopelessly at Asiatic descendant as they sat together around the 
conference table, a little blush sprinkled over her cute cheeks. The 
crush she had on Yoko was pretty much common knowledge. So much so that 
Ash wasn&#39;t a bit surprised to see Cream so starry-eyed when he arrived. 
Yet Yoko was complete devoid of any leaning towards them. It kind of 
made Ash dislike her even more. 

Cream didn&#39;t pay attention to the fact that Ash had arrived until Yoko 
acknowledged him. &quot;You&#39;re late.&quot;

&quot;Gee, what was your first guess?&quot; Ash muttered sarcastically, taking a 
seat by the table, &quot;Cinnamon woke me up, alright? I don&#39;t need any of 
your lectures today.&quot;

Yoko leaned her cheek on her fist. &quot;Have you always been so 
undisciplined? I heard you were one of the top graduates of the Rehoboam 
Martial Facility. I always expected more than this.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ash smirked defiantly at her, &quot;I&#39;d expected you to be less of a 
bitch, but you work with the hand you&#39;re dealt with, right?&quot;

Cream intervened when Yoko and Ash started exchanging nasty glances with 
each other. &quot;Hey, hey now guys, lets not fight, okay?&quot;

Another voice called out to the group after that. &quot;Lieutenant Stenzel is 
quite right. Pipe down.&quot;

Ash, Yoko, Cream and Cinnamon straightened out in recognition of the 
authority of that voice When a second set of automatic doors opened on 
the other side of the room, they all saluted the man who walked through 
them. A black man in his late forties, dressed in a tunic variation of 
the green and gold uniforms that the others wore. This man was Commander 
Donovan Eldiah -- the leader of the Darshana Division and the captain of 
the Paracelsus. The strident military leader stopped before the head of 
the conference table and pressed his gloved palms onto its metal.

&quot;Good morning, Commander!&quot; Cream said cheerfully.

Commander Eldiah shook his head with a frown. &quot;This is unbelievable. We 
finally receive new orders from General Schwartz and two of my best 
soldiers spend their priorities on childish bickering. Is this the force 
you wish to take into war? Cat fighting between allies?&quot;

Yoko sneered at Ash. &quot;Tell that to the hothead -- assuming he can stay 
awake long enough to hear you.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah? Well I&#39;ve got some choice words for YOU to hear, Yoko!&quot;

Commander Eldiah&#39;s eyebrow ticked. &quot;I said knock it off!&quot;

Ash, Cream and Yoko all winced and silenced themselves as their leader&#39;s 
voice picked up. Eldiah took a moment to compose himself once again and 
crossed his arms, parting his lips to speak. &quot;...Thank you. As I told 
you before, we have new orders from General Schwartz. Our current status 
has been stationary since the Saviour insurgency to the south. Now the 
rumours we heard before have been proven correct. The city of Protea has 
been completely overrun by the Saviours.&quot;

Cream gasped. &quot;Are you serious, sir?&quot;

&quot;Quite.&quot;

Yoko narrowed her eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t understand. I thought that Protea was 
one of the first cities to be equipped with the Lambda Effect Shield 
Generators for the purpose of resisting enemy attacks.&quot;

Commander Eldiah nodded. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s true. The Lambda Effect, wave 
production to seal off and centralize particular areas of space, was 
incorporated into the Shield Generators of many cities on Rehoboam after 
the first few years of the Saviour Invasion. But it seems that their 
resistance is weakening. The Saviours and their weaponry are growing 
stronger. In the old days... a standard blast from one of their 
&#39;battleship cannons&#39; would not have been enough to dent a shield of that 
calibre. But the times have changed... and the Saviours are beginning to 
adapt to our artillery and defences. Protea was not a major city... less 
than 4.7 million were living there at the time... but its loss to the 
Saviours is regrettable none the less.&quot;

&quot;So why are we going there?&quot; Ash asked, &quot;Rescue mission for the 
survivors?&quot;

Eldiah shook his head for a no. &quot;Not quite. That&#39;s up to the Regular 
Forces stationed in Crux Cartha. Our mission is a lot more clandestine 
than that. And the orders have been given to us through General Schwartz 
by High Magistrate Dianus.&quot;

The ditzy Cream blinked. &quot;High Magistrate Dianus? Isn&#39;t she a member of 
the Ministry?&quot;

&quot;Correct,&quot; Commander Eldiah affirmed, &quot;they are the chief scientific 
team of Rehoboam Society and the sway they hold with the Galactic 
Confederacy shins through even into the military. I am sure the General 
would rather not have us reduced to this, but his hands are obviously 
tied. We have no choice.&quot;

Ash sneered at this. He hated scientists. He had done ever since he was 
a kid. His parents were scientists too, both of them. Of course the two 
details were related. None the less, Ash leaned back and spoke. &quot;So what 
are the orders, Commander?&quot;

The tall leader of the Darshana uncrossed his arms and pressed a button 
on a small computer panel on the table. A holographic image appeared 
just above it. Ash, Cream, and Yoko stared at it. It was the schematics 
of a diminutive but significant-looking laboratory compound. The 
commander soon re-crossed his arms and explained. &quot;This is the Protea 
Research Facility. It is located three miles southwest of the northern 
control tower of the city, placing it in the heartland of Protea. The 
facility is currently surrounded by the Saviours that have taken over 
Protea. That is our new destination.&quot;

&quot;What does the Ministry want with it?&quot; Yoko questioned 

&quot;Apparently... a test subject of their experiments is trapped inside,&quot; 
The commander stated, &quot;this person is obviously pretty important to 
them. The Ministry have requested that a covert division of the Rehoboam 
Regular Military are levied for the rescue of that individual before the 
Saviours kill him and the rest of the faculty of the research station.&quot;

Yoko tapped her fingernails on the table. &quot;It seems a bit excessive to 
deploy an entire division for the saving of one person.&quot;

&quot;We only need to think about following orders, Lieutenant,&quot; Eldiah said, 
&quot;the reasons behind those orders are not our concern.&quot;

Cream placed her hands together with a smile. &quot;Okay! It&#39;s sad that the 
city has been overrun, but this is our chance to help someone out, 
right? This is our chance! How long &#39;til we reach Protea, Commander?&quot;

Eldiah pressed one of his hands into his hip. &quot;Three and a half hours 
The Paracelsus will fly into the city under cover of our Space-Time 
Illusion Fields You three will all be dropped into the city with some 
C-Gears for good measure, then it will be your duty to enter the 
research facility to retrieve that test subject. Do you all understand?&quot;

The three all nodded and saluted Commander Eldiah with unified shouts of 
&#39;yes, sir&#39;. Eldiah nodded back and then marched off, with Cinnamon 
taking up his rear. When they exited from the conference room from the 
rear doors, the small visual display projecting the diagram of the 
Protea Research Facility switched itself off. 

Ash stood up after that. &quot;I guess this means we&#39;ll have to get prepped 
up for the mission. I&#39;m gonna go tell the engineering team to modify my 
sword for the job. I&#39;ll catch you guys later, okay?&quot;

Cream nodded to him. &quot;See you later, Ash!&quot;

The blonde man nodded back, avoiding eye contact with Yoko. He left 
through the metal automatic doors, back out into the main corridor of 
the second floor. When the shifting sound of the doors re-closing ended, 
Yoko herself stood upright. 

Cream did the same whilst staring at her. &quot;Yoko?&quot;

&quot;I am going to the training bay,&quot; Said the raven-haired soldier, &quot;Your 
bow, my guns and Ash&#39;s sword have all been completely repaired. I want 
to get some practice out of them before we go to Protea. If the 
commander or anyone else asks about it then tell them that that&#39;s where 
I&#39;ll be.&quot;

She stalked off seconds later, through the doors. Cream picked herself 
up and followed after Yoko, going through those doors and out into the 
main corridor. Yoko slowed down a tad when she realized that Cream was 
following her, but didn&#39;t stop. &quot;What is it?&quot;

Cream flushed a deeper shade of red, trailing behind. &quot;Um... Yoko...?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I was wondering... if... maybe...&quot;

Yoko stopped walking without looking back. &quot;Either come out with it or 
go away.&quot;

&quot;Well, I um...&quot; Cream lowered her head and struggled to get it out, 
&quot;after we complete the mission in Protea, do you think we could... 
maybe... go out on a... date or something?&quot;

It was then that Yoko looked back, if not only partially. She cast one 
of her powerful black eyes over her shoulder and stared at the bashful 
redhead blankly. During her schooldays, Yoko had often been told that 
the people of the Old Planet Earth had been very particular about 
relationships. Dating between two people of the same sex or different 
races/religions could cause controversy. But in this era, 3999 AB, 
nearly 4000 years since the destruction of Earth and the transmigration 
of its last remaining human people to other planets, such things were 
not frowned upon. At least not in enlightened places. Alien races were 
particularly ruthless towards inter-religious mingling. A prime example 
being the cat-humanoid Effirans And while Yoko had grown in a society 
that did not share such views, the cold expression upon her face would 
have suggested otherwise. 

&quot;A date? With me?&quot;

Cream nodded brightly. &quot;Uh huh!&quot;

&quot;...Don&#39;t you have more pressing concerns?&quot; Yoko said, looking away once 
more, &quot;instead of flirting with me you should be out perfecting your 
technique with the bow. I have no time for such things.&quot;

Cream&#39;s subsequent sigh was more of defeat than it was disappointment 
&quot;...Um... okay...&quot;

The two of them stood together in silence for a moment. Until Yoko 
produced a scowl and strode off down the corridor towards the lift. 
Cream&#39;s shoulders sagged as she was left to stand alone and remain. Or 
at least she thought that she was alone. She couldn&#39;t see that Ash was 
leaning cross-armed against the wall. 

&quot;Why bother?&quot; He said.

Cream looked up with a start, and saw Ash across from her against the 
wall of the corridor She forced a smile onto her face and tried to perk 
up for his sake. &quot;You saw all that...?&quot;

Ash frowned &quot;I just don&#39;t get it, Cream. You&#39;re so sweet and pretty. 
What in God&#39;s name do you see in a bitch like that Yoko? You really 
think she&#39;s good enough for you?&quot;

&quot;I know you don&#39;t like her, Ash... and I know she can be... hard 
sometimes. But I can&#39;t help it. I feel so great inside when I see her. 
Even if she doesn&#39;t notice me. I can&#39;t ignore her. I just wanna be with 
her. Have you ever felt like that?&quot;

The boy of Germanic descent closed his sapphire blue eyes and smiled 
grudgingly. He actually had felt like that about someone in the past. 
But those days were over. Even if Ash couldn&#39;t bring himself to go past 
them. He opened his eyes again and smiled at her, wrapping his arm 
around the younger girl&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I guess I can&#39;t make this any... 
better for you... but I can try. Feel like an ice cream before the 
mission? My treat.&quot;

Cream&#39;s face brightened. &quot;I&#39;d love one! Thanks, Ash!&quot;

**********

It was a dark room.

A chamber that was covered in shadow and darkness. Twelve spotlights 
descended from an unknown ceiling and surrounded specific sections of a 
circular and ring-shaped table in the middle of that dark room. In each 
spotlight was a certain person sitting beside the table, each of them 
aged and fully knowledgeable in things the likes of which any commoner 
would have trouble simply contemplating. They were the twelve head 
operatives of the scientific world on Rehoboam; Ezra, Nehemiah, Job, 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah and 
Malachi. Those were the ones known as the Ministry. In the centre of the 
ring table and therefore the darkness was another spotlight. And inside 
that spotlight was a certain woman. Dressed in only a grey formal 
business suit. That woman was known as Dianus. And she was the &#39;leader&#39; 
of the Ministry.

Dianus pushed her glasses up the bridge of her nose and smiled. &quot;I see 
all of us have been assembled here today. That is a rare occurrence if 
ever there was one. It must be living proof that that time is at hand.&quot;

&quot;That is not certain,&quot; Malachi said, &quot;there is much work still left to 
be done. The Saviours have begun their attacking of the other planets. 
They are clearly beginning a more thorough sweep of Augustine space. We 
can no longer afford to waste time!&quot;

Nehemiah responded with, &quot;That is correct. Power must be shifted to its 
right course.&quot;

&quot;The Will of God?&quot; Dianus suggested.

&quot;Correct,&quot; Claimed Isaiah, &quot;that is our desire. We seek no more than 
that. Which is why, High Magistrate Dianus, you must hasten our plans. 
We can afford to procrastinate no longer.&quot;

Dianus crossed her arms femininely. &quot;Procrastination? Nothing has been 
slowed down for any reason. All of our endeavours are running together 
smoothly The Zophim is done and needs only activation, something that I 
will see to myself Two subjects have been located for the Ghazali 
Project and therefore the hastening of the Zarathustra&#39;s completion will 
take place. The SIGMA Project, which, as you all know, I am heading 
personally, is less than 3.2% behind schedule. What matters now is 
recovering the Anti-Lambda Effect data from the boy.  The tests run on 
him years ago were inconclusive, but... there is little chance of it 
being stored elsewhere. In light of that... I have made preparations for 
the Rehoboam Regular Military to do the work for us.&quot;

&quot;You are calling in favours for something you are not even sure of?&quot; Job 
wondered. 

&quot;There is no one else,&quot; Dianus told him, &quot;Dr. Sorel was a genius... but 
even geniuses are powerless against the constraints of time. Our current 
call for haste should be proof enough of that much.&quot;

Ezekiel frowned. &quot;Be that as it may... it was because of his 
insurrection to our plans, as well as that of Wilhelm and Maria Gestalt, 
that the Master Plan has been put back as far as this. He would have 
done nothing to make our intentions any easier to grasp.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Dianus replied, &quot;but until the Anti-Lambda Effect data 
is obtained, the Baruva Cannon will not be completed to a degree that 
will suit our purposes for the Master Plan. And more important than 
that... we will never be able to deactivate the Elzabad Mechanism. That 
means we cannot enter into Zone Bethlehem and discover the true nature 
of Dr. Sorel&#39;s research.&quot;

Ezra&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Let me remind you, High Magistrate Dianus, that 
that is NOT part of the Master Plan. The composition of Dr. Sorel&#39;s 
research is no longer of any concern to us. And neither is Zone 
Bethlehem. What in the name of God is the use of a fake heaven?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a personal interest,&quot; Dianus replied, &quot;Indulge me.&quot;

&quot;We have greater issues at hand, Dianus.&quot; Uttered Obadiah.

Dianus chuckled lightly at that. &quot;You needn&#39;t remind me. I am fully 
aware. But let us also not forget that we have a certain businessman&#39;s 
appetite to satiate.&quot;

&quot;Are you referring to Bardia?&quot; Asked Ezra.

&quot;Of course I am,&quot; The brown-haired woman said, &quot;let us not forget that 
he and his Esdraelon Conglomerate supply us with more than 67% of our 
annual finances. Without the Anti-Lambda Effect data, we cannot complete 
the Baruva Cannon. Therefore his installation into our cause will 
vanish. Such an action could bring about the end of the Ministry if we 
let it happen.&quot;

Jonah snorted. &quot;It disgusts me that we have to rely on such a capitalist 
organization to do God&#39;s work. But to accomplish that... we need the 
pecuniary power of the Esdraelon Conglomerate. Michael Bardia might not 
be the same man as his Father, but... he must not become aware of the 
Master Plan. And his investments into the Baruva Cannon must be 
supplemented with success.&quot;

Dianus nodded. &quot;Exactly. This is why I have made sure that the Rehoboam 
Regular Military regain the boy. I am convinced that the data is within 
him. Once we obtain him, I will have the data extracted and we will move 
on with phase one of the Master Plan. The BAS-Series androids have 
already been finished and all the Zophim needs is the commencement of 
initiation. Very soon the Zarathustra, the Baruva Cannon and the SIGMA 
Project will be completed. And then...&quot;

&quot;Very well,&quot; Said Amos, &quot;you seem to have everything in hand, Dianus. 
Proceed as planned if you belief we have the time. But do not forget 
your anointed role. God&#39;s true child shall be born as spoken by our 
will. If you choose to distract yourself by concentrating on unimportant 
details like Zone Bethlehem... we will be forced to reconsider your 
place as conductor of the Master Plan. Is that understood?&quot;

Dianus nodded to him. &quot;Yes sir. Understood.&quot;

**********

Protea was one of the first cities to undergo huge scientific 
development on Rehoboam. The Lambda Effect Shield Generators was not the 
beginning of it. Thousands of years ago, Protea had been little more 
than a trading outpost between the larger city of Crux Cartha and the 
shoreline. But when the scientific discovery boom took over on this 
planet, Protea was one of the first cities to undergo major 
reconstruction The old brick and stones homes were torn down for steel 
and plastics, finished with special chemicals to prevent rusting and 
metal rot. The present Protea was the result. A city that was truly of 
the future. Neon lights gave perfect display and layout of a wide mass 
of rising metal roads which were crossed over by state-of-the-art 
wheel-less hover cars. Computers dominated the running of everything 
Each major city of Rehoboam was fitted with a centralized super-computer 
known as a IGP (Interrelated Grid Processor) which controlled all major 
functions of that city, such as the warmth produced by the underground 
heating systems or the rate of oxygen poured into the city via the 
atmospheric nanomachines in the air. Together they formed a set called 
the Rehoboam Chief Municipality Lattice (RCML). They all acted as a 
circuit. So when one was acting up in one city, the rest would know 
about it before long. Hours after the Saviour attack on Protea, one of 
the other computers in the RCML detected irregularities in Protea&#39;s IGP 
(known as Arphaxad)  before a huge systems shutdown. It was obvious that 
Saviours had attacked it. Which meant that the millions of people still 
trapped inside the city were in greater danger than they already were. 
If Arphaxad didn&#39;t reboot soon, the supply of oxygen given by the 
nanomachines were likely to cease for at least three weeks. While the 
planet itself had a very stable oxygen supply, it was a known fact that 
Saviours dwelled within places lacking the substance more often than 
that. Which meant that there was a huge possibility of a Saviour 
settlement. And considering that many natural resource mines existed 
around Protea, they would have a great deal of reasons to stay. The risk 
of a Saviour settlement was huge; people often said that if such a thing 
were to happen then they would start spreading from that point. And 
since their kind reproduced more than 300 times a year, a settlement in 
Protea was more or less a ticket to kiss the city goodbye. Which was why 
it was all the more important for the Rehoboam Regular Military to help 
stop that possibility. 

One division had gotten here from it.

But not for that purpose.

By now it was the late morning. The sun was, as always, a distant thing 
in the skies of this planet. What could been seen about was the clouds 
and the snow that fell from them. The Paracelsus was now hovering over 
Protea with its Space-Time Illusion Fields in place. It would keep the 
ship from being detected by the Saviour forces that had overrun the 
city. And to say that they had was not an overestimation. The city 
itself was in ruins. Hundreds of buildings had been demolished in the 
Saviour&#39;s onslaught. Flames flickered over the streets and sky roads 
Many cars had been overturned and the windows of all the homes and 
buildings were smashed. The damage was worse in some areas than others 
but almost all parts of the city had been effected in some way. And the 
creatures that had committed these acts stalked through the ghostly 
streets of their new conquest like maggots writhing their way around a 
corpse. 

Saviours were an unusual alien race. Their bodies consisted of a 
material that no one as yet had been able to analyse or know of. The 
best way to describe it was as an unusual mixture between aluminium and 
a very particular kind of carbon-based animal flesh. They differed 
somewhat as well in terms of looks, but only so much so that they fell 
into three special kinds of groups. The lowest form on the hierarchy of 
the Saviours were the Slave-types. These were bipedal humanoid Saviours 
with large hulking bodies and hindmost legs which bent forwards at the 
knee and then backwards, like the hind legs of a four-legged animal. 
Like humans who have lighter shades of skin under their feet and in 
their palms, the Slave-type Saviours had purely biological layers of 
flesh in those places. They were built for war, as regular bullets and 
low-level energy blasts could not pierce their hides. They also carried 
weapons about their person. The standard type of weapon that the 
Slave-type Saviours carried were long pike-shaped rifles which they used 
for gun battles and hand-to-hand combat. But they also possessed natural 
weapons in their bodies Slave-type Saviours could spit corrosive acids 
from the gills under  their necks and they were nearly twice as strong 
as a full grown human male. Their primary role seemed to be as foot 
soldiers and they were predominantly &#39;female&#39;. The next part of the 
Saviour hierarchy were the Behemoth-types. These beasts were gigantic. 
Over 260 metres in length. They hovered in the air like floating whales 
with side fins and two dual-thrashing tails behind them It was not known 
how the Behemoth-types floated in the air as they did -- but most 
Saviour researchers knew that the Behemoth&#39;s were used as living vessels 
to transport the armies from place to place. The third type and highest 
type were the Cherubim-types. These were slightly larger and more agile 
versions of the Slaves-types and were an equal mix of female and male in 
stock The Cherubim-types were differentiated from the rest because they 
were smaller in number and had roles as &#39;commanders&#39; of the small 14-man 
sects that the Saviours divided themselves into. And they were referred 
to as Cherubim because each one had a slack layer of metallic flesh 
trailing down from their left shoulder blade which was shaped like a 
wing. They could not fly on it (they didn&#39;t even seem to have any muscle 
control over them) but probably left them up as banners of war. Most 
researchers assumed that there were more types of Saviours in their own 
Star System, Cartesia, but it was impossible to find out. A barrier that 
ran on the same principle as the Lambda Effect surrounded the Cartesian 
Star System; one that only Saviours could pass through. Therefore no one 
could know just where they were coming from or how many there really 
were. 

The Paracelsus hovered over the broken expanse of Protea, while the 
Behemoth-types scoured the air below and the Slave and Cherubim-types 
stalked the roads. And the three soldiers that the Darshana Division had 
deployed to carry out the mission were down there with them. Ash, Yoko 
and Cream stood together in an alleyway between a former bakery and a 
chemist. All three were dressed in the white and blue combat suits of 
field fighting that all specialized divisions of the Rehoboam Regular 
Military were required to wear. Each of them had armed themselves with 
their respective weapons. Ash had his giant, 1.75 metre-long Zweihander 
broadsword; the Sigmund-PRO8000. It was made with a special alloy that 
had been sharpened with lasers and acids to produce an edge slightly 
thicker than three molecules. That meant that its was technically sharp 
enough to cut through anything. It had been designed specifically to 
kill Saviours; just as Yoko and Cream&#39;s weapons were. Yoko possessed a 
pair of Sankhya-PRO8000 handguns that ran on special cartridges of laser 
energy, and the pair were called Yin and Yang. Cream&#39;s weapon was far 
more diverse. A technological bow (called Sophia-PRO8000) made of 
special elasticised metals. Over her shoulder was a quiver which 
contained more than 40 arrows for the bow, each one armed with a 
particular charge in the arrowhead to produce certain effects. Right now 
Cream had four types of arrows. Fire, Ice, Thunder and Light. They 
served her well. The three soldiers stood together beside the wall and 
watched as Slave-types marched across the streets like mindless 
automatons.  Dozens of broken and bloody corpses were littering the 
ground out there. Protea&#39;s citizens were in mortal danger.

&quot;Damnit!&quot; Ash cursed in whisper, &quot;The Saviours really have infested this 
city!&quot;

Cream blinked. &quot;Isn&#39;t there something we can do to help the survivors?&quot;

&quot;That is not our mission,&quot; Ling told the redhead, &quot;our mission is to 
retrieve the human sample at the behest of the Ministry and General 
Schwartz.&quot;

&quot;But I wanna help!&quot; Cream argued.

Yoko sighed irritably. &quot;Recall what Commander Eldiah said. More 
divisions of the Regular Military will be launched for that purpose. The 
survivors will be helped soon enough when they get here. But for now we 
have to concentrate on doing our own part. We have to get to the Protea 
Research Facility.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s not too far from here if Cinnamon&#39;s map&#39;s to be believed,&quot; 
Ash said, looking at the parchment in his right hand, &quot;but are you sure 
we won&#39;t be seen? There&#39;s a lot of them out there.&quot;

Yoko nodded seriously. &quot;We will be fine. The sight of the Slave-type and 
Behemoth-type Saviours are purely motion-based and heat-based. But the 
C-Gears that are programmed into our battle-suits can scramble our 
warmth signatures as well as mask our presence from the biological 
motion-detection sensors they have The Space-Time Illusion Fields of the 
Paracelsus have that same ability. But the charge for the C-Gears will 
only last half an hour so we must move quickly.&quot;

Ash and Cream nodded to her. Though the Darshana Division was still in 
the early stages of development, a team leader had been selected for the 
mission conducted under its name. That was Yoko. The long-haired woman 
moved ahead of Ash and searched the streets outside. The snow-covered 
steel breadth of the road was beleaguered with the corpses and flames. 
The Slave-types were poised around them, wrecking whatever they could 
find, seemingly for no other purpose than total destruction. Thankfully 
there were no Cherubim-types around this area. Unlike the Slaves and the 
Behemoths, they could not be fooled by the C-Gears. They would have to 
move fast before one came their way and alerted the Slaves to their 
presence. Yoko nodded hard and ran out into the street right away. Ash 
and Cream followed after her in that instant The three of them jogged 
across the wrecked street, past the six or so Saviours standing by. They 
really were masked by the C-Gears. In no time at all they got across the 
wide street and found themselves on the borderline of a new district The 
buildings from her on in were much larger and taller than those behind. 
It meant that they were getting deeper into the city. Ash, Yoko and 
Cream strode through the roads of the area as fast as they could without 
making too much noise. Though they probably couldn&#39;t be heard because of 
all the noise in the background (women screaming, flames crackling, 
buildings crumbling, wind howling etc)  the hearing of the Saviours was 
something they could not mask themselves from. They kept going until 
they reached the place that Cinnamon had marked out. A tall office-like 
structure that stood within a grassy courtyard of the city. It was the 
Protea Research Facility. Though it had a business skyscraper feel to 
it, the actual research took place underground, below the building 
itself. The upper levels were no more than administrative offices.  

Cream looked up at it. &quot;That&#39;s the place? A bit swanky for a research 
station of the Ministry, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Lets just keep moving, alright?&quot; Yoko requested. 

She started moving ahead. Ash shrugged and followed after her. Cream did 
the same. The three of them slowly inched their way towards the grass 
courtyard that surrounded the building. More of the Slave-types were 
standing around it, picking at the flesh of some of the corpses of the 
citizens. Saviours were known only to eat meat. Their preference seemed 
to be red meat, but they also had a taste for human meat. Apparently it 
offered more in the way of sustenance and less in the way of fat, 
despite the bad taste. Cream wretched when she saw that, one of the 
Slaves ripping out the liver and kidneys of a elderly woman and 
devouring them whole with its now bloodied hands. But she kept up the 
slow walk with the others. They got into the courtyard and paced down 
the steel path that had been built between the patches of artificial 
grass. Again they passed by more of the Saviours but they made it to the 
glass doors that stood before the entrance into the building. Cream 
stepped up and looked through them. She could see some of the staff 
members inside. Two women were huddled together behind the reception 
desk inside. 

Ash looked in as well. &quot;Survivors?&quot;

&quot;These buildings,&quot; Yoko began, &quot;those belonging to the Ministry, use a 
large form of the C-Gear to conceal the life inside from being detected 
by Saviours in emergency situations. They are currently working on a 
C-Gear large enough to conceal entire cities from Saviours, but... there 
has been no success so far.&quot;

Cream shook her head. &quot;Who cares? Let&#39;s just help them out.&quot;

&quot;Come on then, guys.&quot; Ash took up the lead and pressed his shoulder into 
the frame of the glass door. Since Arphaxad had suffered a complete 
shutdown, even the smallest things it controlled, like the automatic 
doors, were out of commission. But it would alert the Saviours if he 
simply broke that glass to get in. So he just pushed it. After a quick 
struggle the glass and metal door parted from the doorway and entered. 
Cream and Yoko followed behind him. They closed the doors back behind 
them, being careful not to make too much noise lest any nearby Saviours 
hear it. Once they came through, the two receptionists slowly turned and 
looked up in fear. But their expressions mellowed when they saw the 
emblem of the Rehoboam Regular Military inscribed across the chests of 
their battle-suits.  

&quot;Oh thank God!&quot; One woman said, &quot;The Military!&quot;

Cream placed a finger to her pink lips. &quot;Shush! Don&#39;t make too much 
noise or move around too much! Or else the Saviours might catch on!&quot;

&quot;Um... Cream... Yoko said that this building has a C-Gear System.&quot; Said 
Ash.

&quot;...Oh...&quot; The redhead crossed her arms, nodding, &quot;Okay then. That&#39;s 
cool&quot;

Yoko sneered with irritation and walked forwards. &quot;Listen to me. We are 
not here as a rescue team. There are far too many Saviours around for 
that. You will have to wait here for now until the rest of the Military 
get here. We came for one reason only. A human test sample is here that 
we have been ordered to collect, so-&quot;

All of a sudden there was a crash at the other side of the room. Yoko, 
Ash, Cream and the two receptionists jerked around when they heard 
something smash through glass and metal. It just happened to be a 
Slave-type Saviour, driving its ten-foot high body through the frame of 
the front of the office. The being ambled into the building slowly, 
while the others quickly reacted. Yoko withdrew her pair of laser 
handguns into either hand and took aim at the creature. Ash withdraw his 
giant broadsword into a two-handed grip while Cream poised her 
Sophia-PRO8000 bow before her and withdrew an arrow from her quiver. A 
flame-tip. 

Ash scowled &quot;Oh this is rich! I thought you said that this building was 
built with a C-Gear System!&quot;

&quot;That was what I was told!&quot; Yoko replied back, &quot;But it looks like no 
more than a searcher drone used for reconnaissance missions! Ash, keep 
going ahead and retrieve the sample! Cream and I will deal with this!&quot;

Ash nodded grudgingly and turned his back. He looked to the 
receptionist, hearing the vibrant sonic screech of the Saviour from 
behind him. &quot;Where&#39;s the test sample?!&quot;

&quot;S-sub-level eight!&quot; The second woman stammered, &quot;but A-Arphaxad is 
offline, so... y-you&#39;ll have to u-use the stairs to get there...&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; The blonde boy nodded and sheathed Sigmund-PRO8000 once again. 
He then made a break for the left. On that side of the room was the 
doorway that led to the stairwell. Ash dashed over their and kicked the 
door open in his stride, only stopping to spare a glance at Cream and 
Yoko. It was just as drone they were facing but they were going to fight 
it by the book. Yoko crossed her guns over each other and watched for 
her moment while the Saviour brooded around the front part of the 
reception area. It shuffled with its small metallic feet to the side a 
little, as though it were searching for something. Then she acted. Yoko 
pulled the triggers of both guns and started firing at its feet. The 
Slave-type Saviour screeched loudly at the blasts of blue light and 
shuffled itself to one side. It was not Yoko&#39;s intention to hit it, but 
rather herd it into a certain area and...

&quot;Cream!&quot; She yelled, &quot;Aim for the head!&quot;

The younger woman nodded and crossed her flame-tip arrow over the centre 
of the bow and against the middle of the string. Cream pulled back both 
the string and the tail of the arrow and took aim at the cranium of the 
Slave while Yoko marched it around under the dirge of her gunplay. Then 
she released the arrow. It went zooming straight for the head of the 
Saviour and nailed it dead on. The beast screeched loudly as green blood 
burst from the wound. Then seconds later the flame charge in the 
arrowhead took place. A powerful combustion of flames burst open the 
biomechanical skull of Slave, splattering the sallow green innards and 
blood across the far wall. Its now headless body dropped to the ground 
lifelessly. 

While Cream and Yoko lowered their weapons with exhaling breaths, Ash 
was charging down the long metal stairwell built underneath ground level 
of the Protea Research Facility It was quite a ways down. Which was to 
be expected. After all they didn&#39;t want just anyone coming down here. 
Eventually Ash made it down to sub-level eight. It was not the lowest 
floor of the complex but it was obviously one of the more significant. 
He strode out of the stairwell and into the compartment which housed the 
door to that level. A huge metal door stood in his way. One that 
obviously used computerized locks. But since Arphaxad was out of 
commission, so too was the lock. Ash curled his fingers into the slight 
gap between the two slabs of metal and pushed them apart with all the 
strength he could muster, gritting his teeth. He was able to part it 
enough create a small indentation to slip through It was more than 
enough. Ash got into sub-level eight and took a look around him It was a 
laboratory alright. Dozens of white tables were around the room. Each of 
them covered over with papers, chemical jars, computer disks, books, 
schematics, etc. Across from him was a large cylinder filled to the brim 
with oxygenated liquids The silhouette of a human was seen from it. 
There was someone inside it. And despite that person&#39;s feminine figure, 
Ash could tell that that person was a boy. Even so that was not what was 
bothering him. It was something else. 

Corpses were in this room. 

At least ten people were laying dead between the tables and chairs of 
this level. All of them were scientists dressed in white lab coats. And 
although he couldn&#39;t stand these kinds of people, it made him wonder 
just what could have done this. He reached behind his back to the hilt 
of his Sigmund-PRO8000, thinking of a possible Saviour incursion. But 
than that didn&#39;t make sense either. There was no damage done to the room 
itself, which contradicted the Saviour&#39;s normal smash-and-crash 
approach. So there had to be more to it than this. 

But then... another called to him. &quot;You&#39;re late.&quot;

Ash turned around swiftly and blinked. He stepped back when he saw 
someone else standing at the doorway to sub-level eight. A man (judging 
by the timbre of his voice). He stood taller than Ash with his body 
fully concealed inside a long and hooded amethyst cloak that pooled 
around his feet. The shadows of the hood prevented Ash from seeing his 
face. But all the same... he couldn&#39;t mistake this odd sense of... 
nostalgia, when he heard that voice 

&quot;Who are you?&quot;

The hooded man chuckled. &quot;I can&#39;t believe it. It&#39;s only been three years 
since that time... yet you don&#39;t remember me. I&#39;m disappointed. But none 
the less... haven&#39;t you grown...?&quot;

&quot;Ugh,&quot; Ash shook his head, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t know how you know me, and I&#39;m 
pretty sure that I don&#39;t know who you are. But I&#39;m Lieutenant Ashriel 
Gestalt of the Darshana Division of the Rehoboam Regular Military. This 
area is swarming with Saviours so you&#39;d best escape to an upper level. 
You&#39;ll be trapped if you stay down here.&quot;

&quot;Heh, heh, heh,&quot; The older one chuckled once more with that slow, 
sundering voice of his, &quot;What makes you believe... that I am in danger?&quot;

Ash narrowed his eyes. &quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot;

&quot;I work for the Esdraelon Conglomerate. I&#39;m a member of the Archangels. 
Is that enough?&quot;

The blonde soldier thought about that. The Esdraelon Conglomerate. They 
were one of the biggest financial corporations in the Augusta Star 
System. Their annual revenue was equal to that of any small scale 
planet. It was hard to imagine that such a company could rise to power 
so quickly, but the Esdraelon Conglomerate had only been forged 200 
years ago. Since the death of the previous owner, his son, Michael 
Bardia, had taken over the empire. They were heavily involved in 
political affairs and existed primarily as a supply group. They sold 
everything from meats, grains and vegetables, to Magi Armours and 
high-tech motherboards. They had grown to such a level that Michael 
Bardia himself, the chief executive of the group, had a personal guard 
about him at all times. They were known as the Archangels. Their role 
was primarily the guardianship of the leader of the conglomerate at all 
times. But suspicions had been running high about them recently. Many 
people thought that the Archangels were also some kind of secret agents; 
spying on the Esdraelon&#39;s rivals and taking care of them if need be. And 
this man claimed to be one of them.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Ash mused about it, &quot;But what would an Archangel be doing out 
here? The headquarters of the Esdraelon Conglomerate is in Crux Cartha.&quot;

The cloaked man lifted his head up a little with another of those 
derisive chuckles. That lessened the shadows over his face for a moment. 
Ash looked hard and saw his eyes. They were the bloodiest shade of red 
he had ever seen. &quot;You want to know... what I&#39;m doing here? You couldn&#39;t 
possibly know that now. There is still more for me to do... and the time 
is not quite right. But it will be here soon. The time when your power 
will be on the grandest stage of them all.&quot;

&quot;My power?&quot; Ash looked over his shoulder, &quot;It&#39;s just a sword.&quot;

Though Ash could not see the man&#39;s face, he could tell that it had just 
become serious. &quot;I&#39;m not talking about that piece of tin foil. I&#39;m 
talking about the power that flows through your veins as it does with my 
own. The power of Mana... one of the three energies of destruction. 
Willed upon us by those who sought to play God but feared God&#39;s 
judgement... and so they ran from it.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Ash questioned.

&quot;Have you forgotten that as well?&quot; The mysterious one supposed, &quot;You who 
was supposedly the shining hope of the ASEPP?&quot;

&quot;ASEPP?&quot;

&quot;The Anti-Saviour Eugenic Paramilitary Plan,&quot; He confirmed, &quot;has it been 
so long for you? That you have forgotten the powers you were endowed 
with? You had no problems in using them before... that Kabbalah magic of 
yours. I suppose sand really doesn&#39;t travel up the hourglass.&quot; 

Now Ash was deathly aware, so telling by the furious expression of shock 
on his face. &quot;It can&#39;t be. How in the hell would you know about that?!&quot;

The humour in the older one&#39;s voice returned. &quot;Heh, heh, heh. So now you 
remember. Your Mother and Father, Wilhelm and Maria Gestalt, the 
Ministry&#39;s insurrectionists... now you can recall their legacy. And so 
it begins. I came here only to remind you of those times... so that you 
will be ready for our next meeting. Well can take our time then... and 
reminisce about the good old days... first hand.&quot;

The cloak-enswathed one turned his back and laughed lightly once more. 
Ash still didn&#39;t understand who he was or what he was getting about. How 
did this guy know his parents? And why did he sound as if he and Ash had 
previous connection? &quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not ready to know,&quot; Replied the other one, &quot;but you shall be 
soon enough. For now you need only know this. The boy in that test tube 
will be the focus of many. All will seek him. But never forget... your 
own significance. Never forget... that you are the one who matters... 
you... or at least that which is inside you... is the substance to which 
the rhythm of the universe bends. You... Ashriel Gestalt...&quot;

It was clear that Ash wanted to know more, but we would not get the 
chance to question this man about it. A column of magical energy, cast 
in the form of water, rose up his body like an ascending turret. It 
swallowed him whole and gushed its contents over the floor. When the 
water subsided the man was gone. Ash growled and grit his teeth. It was 
a water teleportation. A skill of Kabbalah magic. And when he looked 
back at the dead bodies of the scientists at work here, it occurred to 
him that the Saviours had not been the ones to kill them. It was 
obviously that guy But who was he? His thoughts were cut short when Yoko 
and Cream slid through the doors into sub-level eight. 

Yoko looked around. &quot;Have you found the one yet?&quot;

&quot;Uh yeah...&quot; He pointed over his shoulder at the test tube, &quot;over 
there.&quot;

The older woman walked over to the glass cylinder to check it out. While 
Cream just moved up and stared curiously at the stunned expression on 
her friend&#39;s face. &quot;Ash? Is everything okay?&quot;

When he realized that he was worrying Cream with his own troubled 
thoughts and sudden memories of the past, Ash shook his head as if to 
work off a brain freeze. He bobbed his head with small smile and turned 
to advance on the test tube like Yoko had done Cream just shrugged and 
followed him. They came to glass container It was still warm even though 
the heating systems of the building were not working. A boy floated nude 
inside it. Someone looking to be Cream&#39;s own age, no more than sixteen 
or so. 

&quot;Is this it?&quot; Cream wondered, &quot;Is he the boy?&quot;

Yoko crossed her arms. &quot;The receptionist above told us there is only one 
person used as a test subject here. There is no doubt that he is the 
one.&quot;

&quot;Well then lets do this thing.&quot; Cream uttered. She stepped forwards 
slightly and moved her hand across the glass of the cylinder, wiping 
away of the condensation on it, caused by the clash of the cold 
temperature of the climate and the warmth of the container. This gave a 
clear view of the face of the one inside. But when he saw that face, 
those baby-soft cheek so lightly sprinkled with freckles, Ash was thrown 
for six. 

A haunted look passed through his eyes. &quot;It can&#39;t be!&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Yoko questioned.

Cream looked at him. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ash?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no way! But I thought... that he was... is it really... could 
it really be...?&quot; Ash looked at the test tube again, &quot;...Rain...?&quot;

**********

Agnus Dei was quite frankly the greatest city of the modern era. For 
years now and (so people assumed) for years in the future it was to 
stand as the best and most frank example of human advancement. Agnus Dei 
was the capital of Rehoboam and the seat of its leader, Tsar Urkan III. 
This was where the scientific boom started. This was where the Ministry 
truly held power. Agnus Dei was the largest city of the planet covering 
a total distance of more than 3,000 miles of land. Its people numbered 
at more than 38.9 million. Though the birth rate had been slipping in 
recent years (perhaps a sentiment intended by the government and the 
Tsar) it had the largest number of people in a single city in the 
Augusta Star System. The city was a hub of... everything. The arts, 
culture, science, knowledge, wealth, military training, living 
standards, health care, human and android rights, etc. Many people 
regarded this thriving metropolis as some kind of utopia. It was perfect 
in many ways. And it was (as yet) the only city on Rehoboam to 
successfully resist the Saviours. For quite some time the highest and 
most powerful technologies were created here. It was the first ever 
&#39;super-city&#39;. A nation within a nation. 

In one of the central districts of the city, one of the 62 districts, 
stood a building overlooking the many wharfs of the Jungian River, 
running through the centre of the city. It was called the Ministerial 
Bastion. It was the major headquarters of the Ministry&#39;s ownership. An 
elevated steel tower skyscraper looming above all others in the 
district. In one of the upper levels of the building was a large office. 
That office belonged to Dianus Maximus, the appointed leader and orator 
of the Ministry. She sat behind her desk with her hands locked together 
while a certain girl sat next to her desk on her own chair. A woman who 
happened to have a startling resemblance to the one known as Cream. The 
two of them sat before another in that office. A dark-haired young 
businessman dressed in a grey suit and tie. He was one of the richest 
men in the known sphere of influence.

He was Michael Bardia.

Dianus smiled at him. &quot;I had been expecting you to come for something 
like this. Are you doubting what the Ministry is capable of, Mister 
Bardia?&quot;

Bardia pressed his hand against his hip. &quot;Don&#39;t get uppity. You can&#39;t 
honestly expect me to let this go. I spent a lot of money in funding the 
research of the Ministry for that weapon. If you don&#39;t even have the 
data to get it running then what&#39;s the goddamned point?&quot;

&quot;I will have it soon,&quot; Dianus told him, &quot;as I have told the High Council 
members. The Rehoboam Military will do its work for us. That&#39;s what they 
are good for, right?&quot;

&quot;I have doubts about involving them in this.&quot; Bardia told her.

Dianus shook her head. &quot;Something they also expressed. But there is no 
need to fear. They do not know the true nature of our intentions. And 
the Tsar has decreed personal anonymity to requests made by the Ministry 
on the military, depending on their size. As far as anyone knows we are 
only recapturing a pricey experiment before the Saviours destroy it.&quot;

&quot;None the less,&quot; Bardia said, &quot;I had one of my Archangels oversee 
everything.&quot;

&quot;...Who?&quot;

Bardia spoke simply. &quot;Zanaan.&quot;

The expression on Dianus&#39; face grew concerned. &quot;Do you really think that 
to be a wise move? He was the one to originally capture the sample, was 
he not? And are you forgetting that he was the son of-&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Bardia said haltingly, &quot;but he is the best of my group. No one 
is stronger than he is. And I don&#39;t question his loyalty for a second. 
You on the other hand, I have doubts about you. I was told that the 
Baruva Cannon would be completed by now. So then why then is it that the 
project is more than three months behind schedule?&quot;

Dianus leaned her face on her fist. &quot;You know why. The Anti-Lambda 
Effect data has not been extracted yet. Until then I cannot proceed with 
completion But it will not be long now. The military will do its work 
and I will personally go about continuing the production of the Baruva 
Cannon myself. But until then, I have something else to show you.&quot;

The older woman looked to her right. The twentysomething businessman 
across from her followed that gaze. And they both laid eyes upon the 
redheaded beauty sitting next to Dianus&#39; desk. She had been dressed in a 
very exquisite black satin dress that cut off around her thighs. A black 
strap necklace was attached to her neck with a silver crucifix dangling 
from it. Her elongated locks of strawberry-blonde hair danced all the 
way down to the small of her back. And her piercing jade eyes looked 
forwards with a stare that was disturbingly blank.

&quot;And she is?&quot; Bardia said with a shrug. 

Dianus looked to the girl and commanded, &quot;Introduce yourself.&quot; 

Though she was a purely biological entity, the redhead one spoke with a 
mechanized albeit feminine voice. &quot;I am Isabelle Maximus.&quot;

Bardia stared at the beautiful girl. &quot;Is this...?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Dianus corrected, &quot;she is not my daughter. She is my secretary. 
And she is also the first of BAS Series.&quot;

The leader of the Esdraelon Conglomerate blinked with surprise. &quot;Wait a 
minute? BAS? As in Biological Android Series? You have one of those with 
you?&quot;

&quot;Why does that surprise you?&quot; She asked him, &quot;I was one of the ones 
behind the production of the BAS Series. And the Esdraelon Conglomerate 
was the group that supplied the Ministry with both the machinery and the 
data necessary to conduct the brainwave reprogramming, was it not? 
Surely you are aware of that?&quot;

&quot;Those plans were made years ago,&quot; Bardia informed, &quot;during my Father&#39;s 
time.&quot;

Dianus smiled. &quot;Naturally. It is only now that we have been able to 
complete the series. The problems we had with the brainwave 
reprogramming were eventually overcome by the research findings of the 
Ladeny branch of the Ministry This girl, Isabelle, is the first of the 
final production models of the BAS Series While I am not greatly pleased 
with the length of time it took to complete them... it does present us 
with a very wonderful opportunity.&quot;

&quot;To do what? What are you-&quot; Bardia stopped himself when he realized, 
&quot;Hold on. You&#39;re not suggesting that we actually use THEM for the core 
of the Seraphim Duplicates, are you?&quot;

Dianus stood up from her desk with another smirk, then walked around to 
the chair that Isabelle was sitting on. She wrapped her arms around the 
younger one and sighed, smelling the faint scent of chestnuts and 
cherries that adhered to the girl&#39;s hair. Isabelle looked on with 
vacant, almost lifeless eyes. Bardia watched this as Dianus spoke again, 
saying,

&quot;You consider yourself to be a mortal god, right? Mustn&#39;t a god have his 
messengers?&quot;

Bardia scowled while Dianus fawned over Isabelle lustily. &quot;Have you lost 
your mind?! They might be your creations but all humanoid life other 
than that of the Saviours is protected under new Rehoboam law! Even that 
of the mechanical androids!&quot;

&quot;Which is why I had mass production started on Shem,&quot; Dianus said, &quot;it 
is a planet not bound by the same laws as Rehoboam or Alvastian.&quot;

&quot;That makes no difference! What good will they be if we can&#39;t use them 
here?! All they&#39;d have to do is run a few tests, find the source, and 
then the Tsar, the Government and the rest of the Galactic Confederacy 
will be onto us!&quot;

&quot;We will be able to use them here. Once the flesh of my BAS Series 
merges with the steel armour of the Seraphim Duplicate titanium vessels, 
they will become as one. The transmigration of souls to produce a unit 
of the same stock as the Saviours. It wasn&#39;t always the Ministry&#39;s 
intention... but it will happen. And when it does it will be impossible 
for anyone to correctly deduce the nature of them. There is no problem&quot;

&quot;But still!&quot; Bardia argued.

&quot;You said that you wanted a weapon, didn&#39;t you? A weapon for use against 
the Saviours? One which you could sell to the military to make yourself 
even richer? While the Baruva Cannon is still that weapon, it will not 
be completed until the current data for the Anti-Lambda Effect is taken 
by us. So now you have another weapon to please yourself with. One that 
shall soon be an army...&quot;

Bardia remained silent and watched mesmerized as Dianus ran her hands up 
and down Isabelle&#39;s unmoving body, caressing her breasts and stroking 
her thighs &quot;Look at her. She&#39;s nothing more than a doll. A collection of 
intricate DNA strands woven together to form a replication of humankind. 
She is beautiful... and fully capable of doing things that real humans 
are, given the right programming. But she had no soul. No will to live 
and no will to make progression. Souls are gifts from God blessed upon 
us from birth. They are the source of free will and that is what 
separates us from machines and animals. Should a marionette like this be 
afforded the same rights as a human? Even when she has no soul of her 
own? How could using her be unjust when she lacks the one thing 
necessary to contemplate the very meaning of justice?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s crap,&quot; Bardia said sternly, &quot;neither you nor I make the rules. 
And it&#39;s not even my call. The Galactic Confederacy will not stand for 
this. If you went through with this and they discovered the truth, I 
could lose everything!&quot;

Dianus stared at Bardia while her cheek was pressed up against 
Isabelle&#39;s. &quot;You worry too much, Michael. I know for a fact that you 
have performed acts that compromised Rehoboam law in the past. This time 
will be no different. Until the Baruva Cannon is ready you can amuse 
yourself with my Seraphim Replicates. Models 1-25 are already 
operational and are ready to be transported from the Shemite city of 
Aggadah to Rehoboam by next week. Are you satisfied with that?&quot;

&quot;Do I have a choice?&quot; Questioned the younger man.

&quot;I imagine that you don&#39;t.&quot;

Bardia growled and stomped off towards the door out of Dianus&#39; office He 
slammed the door behind him when he left. The main member of the 
Ministry chuckled and peeled herself off of Isabelle. She then sat down 
over the front of the desk, saying, &quot;Poor deluded soul. He sees the 
future as shaped only by money. Little does he know that money will 
provide no protection in what is to come. Such is the fate of the 
capitalist. But enough of Bardia. Isabelle... come to me.&quot;

The redheaded bioandroid stood from her seat like she was commanded and 
then moved before Dianus Her eyes were still as devoid of emotion as 
ever. Just like the monotone pitch of her voice. &quot;Yes, Madam?&quot;

&quot;You may please me.&quot;

Isabelle bobbed her head slowly in acknowledgment. &quot;Yes, Madam.&quot;

Dianus looked on with a small smile as Isabelle lowered herself onto her 
black stocking covered knees. She positioned herself before her 
mistress. She then reached out with her thin fingers and slipped them up 
the grey material of Dianus&#39; skirt. Her hands reached in and she hooked 
the tips of her thumbs under the elastic of the older woman&#39;s underwear. 
Dianus watched intently while Isabelle pulled her black lace panties out 
into the light of day. They were drenched in premature wetness, reeking 
of that half-musky, half-medical scent. Dianus spoke again when Isabelle 
pulled them about halfway down her thighs

&quot;Pull them down the rest of the way with your teeth.&quot;

Isabelle nodded. &quot;Yes, Madam.&quot;

The bioandroid carefully bit at the damp black panties with her pearly 
white teeth and pulled them down as gently as possible. Dianus made the 
job easier and lifted both legs slightly. Isabelle gently tugged them 
down the length of Dianus&#39; legs down to her ankles and off her midnight 
black high heel pumps. When she was done, the redhead only sat there, 
with Dianus&#39; panties dangling from her mouth, awaiting further orders.

Dianus smirked. &quot;Good. Drop them. And please me.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Madam.&quot; She answered, releasing her mistress&#39; panties from between 
her teeth. 

Isabelle moved back against the desk in her kneeling position and 
gradually lowered her head into the gap between Dianus&#39; thighs, her 
skirt hiked up to do so. Dianus watched as this happened, but shut her 
eyes in breathless bliss when she felt her creation run her tongue up 
the folds of her dampened labia. Isabelle proceeded to lick at the 
sensitive flesh, knowing through mental programming and conditioning the 
points at which Dianus best liked to be touched. Her pink tongue moved 
up and down in a slow and rhythmic pattern, lapping at it. Of her own 
accord she reached up with one hand and used her index and middle 
fingers to part the woman&#39;s lower lips. And a second later she inserted 
her tongue fully into that crevice. Dianus&#39; gasped with wide eyes and 
groaned pleasurably at the feeling. Her tight vaginal tract contorted 
and clenched around Isabelle&#39;s tongue, spreading more of her fragrant 
wetness into the girl&#39;s lips. And it continued. Dianus&#39; moans grew 
hoarse and disjointed throughout it. Isabelle&#39;s head bobbed in and out 
of her mistress&#39; fleshy orifice. The smell of her discharge grew around 
the office. Dianus began humping herself on Isabelle&#39;s mouth over and 
over and over again. Until she reached her peak. The committee leader of 
the Ministry tilted her head back and cried out effeminately, gaining 
attainment of her desired orgasm. Dianus reached around Isabelle&#39;s head 
and kept the girl&#39;s head buried there. Isabelle did not stop the 
thrusting of her tongue. And she would not do so until Dianus commanded 
her to.

&quot;...That&#39;s right, Isabelle,&quot; Dianus muttered breathlessly, &quot;my dearly 
beloved puppet...&quot;
