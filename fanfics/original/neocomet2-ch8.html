~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Special Mission Corp&#39;s Temporary Camp, Ravensburg 

Lilia cast her eyes forward, to the other side of the encampment. Just 
ahead was Saizaki. Facing the forest, looking away from the camp, with a 
cigarette between his fingers and a frustrated, pensive look on his 
face. Lilia felt like she could sympathize with what Saizaki and 
Rainhande were feeling. Though they didn&#39;t like each other anyway, their 
outburst was born primarily of frustration and anger. The Special 
Mission Corps had never suffered so many losses in one go before Even 
when they had procured three of the legendary four swords. Now they were 
isolated in some dingy forest outside of Ravensburg. What could the next 
move possibly be?

Lilia slowly crept up to Saizaki, being careful not to disturb him. It 
seemed logical, since Saizaki had been on the edge of a blade all night. 
She stopped walking when they were standing side by side, looking 
outwardly from the encampment. 

&quot;You okay?&quot;

Saizaki released a puff of smoky air, orally. &quot;...I feel like I&#39;ve got 
one hell of a hangover, without ever touching the bottle. I just don&#39;t 
understand how things could have gotten so bad, so quickly Just three 
days ago, everything was great. Now it&#39;s like we&#39;re in hell.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Lilia nodded in earnest, &quot;Things have gotten to me too. But we 
can&#39;t let that get us down. We have to stick together now. More than 
ever. If we don&#39;t, what hope do we have in winning the war?&quot;

Saizaki drew more smoke into his lungs, his eyes looking upward to the 
moon. It was beautiful tonight, none of the clouds overhanging Europe 
were blocking it from view. It made the image of Saizaki and Lilia&#39;s 
relent from below look... less disheartening. And a lot more uplifting.

&quot;Guess we just can&#39;t give up.&quot; Saizaki said, idly. &quot;Coming this far and 
throwing in the towel would be a kick in the crotch. Besides, I doubt 
Dad would ever forgive me if I did.&quot;

Lilia nudged closer to Saizaki, watching that expression on his face. 
Saizaki seemed more tranquil and focussed as when he was speaking of his 
adoptive father, Setsuya Seisuji. 

&quot;Tell me about him.&quot; Lilia asked in a whisper. 

&quot;Pops?&quot; Saizaki grinned, &quot;I suppose most sons look up their dads. But I 
actually had good reason to. He was an incredible man. And so skilled 
with a blade. You know, he single-handedly took out a wild boar when he 
was my age? Heh, it earned him a Chinese girlfriend. Some girl called 
Lin-Lin. Then he went so far as to win that tournament, defeating 
Zephaniah A man who was supposed to be the strongest sword-fighter of 
western descent. Not even Commander Highland could beat that guy on his 
own. I always respected that The fact that my Dad could do things that 
no one else could. And even when he was getting old, he still had time 
for me. The man found me outside the Safe-Zones... abandoned by my birth 
parents.&quot;

&quot;Do you remember anything about them?&quot; Lilia asked, curiously.

Saizaki shook his head as a no. &quot;Nope. And I wouldn&#39;t much care to. The 
ones who&#39;re your parents are the ones who raise you. The one who raised 
me was Setsuya. And that&#39;s why I talk so much about him. Dad meant 
everything to me. He was all I had... so losing him really did a number 
on me. I guess that&#39;s why I want to master the blade so badly. So I can 
live up to him. &quot;

Lilia sighed, with a solemn expression. She knew exactly what that was 
like. To lose your parents, the support you had in this scarred world. 

&quot;I understand, Saizaki. I lost my Mother and Father to sickness. That is 
the reason I left Neo-France and came to Neo-Germany. Joining the Order 
of Light seemed like the right thing to do.&quot;

Saizaki&#39;s neck cricked as his head looked down at Lilia. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Lilia. Here I am, bitching about how much I miss my Dad, and you&#39;ve lost 
both of your parents.&quot; 

That brought on a smile from the younger girl. She didn&#39;t feel anger 
with Saizaki. In fact, she felt the opposite. She loved it when he spoke 
about his family It was one of the few times that Saizaki showed a 
completely unguarded side to himself. The silent but conspicuous part of 
him that was the vulnerable little boy. It far overshadowed his 
unrefined adult-teen persona. Lilia wrapped her smaller arm around 
Saizaki&#39;s longer one, then rested her head upon his broad shoulder. Just 
being around Saizaki was enough to make her feel better Saizaki let a 
small smile cross his lips. Out of all the people left on the face of 
this cadaver of place called Second Earth, Lilia was the only one who he 
would lay his life on the line for. And even though the two were dressed 
in their shredded combat tunics and armour, they looked very beautiful 
together. Under the moonlight, the sound of light banter in the 
background, the crackling of the open fires. It all contributed to how 
they looked together. And how they felt about each other

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize,&quot; Lilia said, her voice barely audible, &quot;I 
like speaking with you about this. It&#39;s nice, you know?&quot;

Saizaki beamed warmly at the Neo-French woman. &quot;Yeah. I think I do.&quot;

But all great moments of tranquillity are disturbed... 

&quot;The summoning of my powers to the transcendent level! I unleash the 
Silver Devil!&quot; 

Both Saizaki and Lilia shot their heads around as they heard the 
distinct sound of a female magic-user&#39;s chant. But before they could 
even see who it was, a silvery blast of pure ferocious power smashed 
into the campsite. It exploded upon contact with the ground, and the 
surrounding soldiers at the blast point were all tossed helplessly into 
the air. Along with tents, supplies and soil. Saizaki and Lilia were 
thrown off their feet and knocked to the ground by the shockwaves of the 
&#39;Silver Devil&#39; blast. They tumbled away into a growth of bushes, as a 
cloud of dust blew through that area. The thundering sound of that blast 
echoed into the black darkness of the forest, the animals and birds all 
scampering for safety. Saizaki scowled in the bushes, but kept his eye 
on Lilia.

&quot;Are you alright?!&quot; He asked urgently.

Lilia nodded She was shocked. She and Saizaki were talking, then all 
hell breaks loose. The Japanese boy looked over at the campsite from the 
bushes they were in. He could see enemy troops barge their way in. The 
surviving soldiers for the Order of Light all unsheathed their weapons 
and began fighting back, out of sheer instinct. The cries of a fresh new 
battle were soon filling the dank forest, fresh blood about to be spilt. 
Saizaki then looked up into the night sky, to see something he might not 
have wanted to. 

Diana.

The sorceress was floating high above the campsite, in midair, her 
silhouette being cast by the light of the full moon. Both Saizaki and 
Lilia were shocked. Diana and her forces had managed to track them down 
to Ravensburg! 

&quot;Damn!&quot; Saizaki whispered under his breath, &quot;How in the hell did she 
find us? I knew camping here was a bad idea!&quot;

Hovering high above the campsite was an inpatient Diana. &quot;Come out, 
Saizaki I know that you are here. You know I will find you. Show 
yourself. Or I swear I shall kill every single member of your remaining 
forces myself. I command you to appear before me!&quot;

Saizaki gripped the hilt of Fire Cutter, which was sleeping in the 
sheath strapped to his waist He was fully prepared to fight Diana. But 
winning was a whole new issue. He had tried to defeat her at Rosenheim 
and the only thing he succeeded in doing was humiliating himself. 
Considering the circumstances now, he had even less of a chance to win 
But what choice did Saizaki have? He had to stop that psycho before she 
did anymore damage to the Order of Light. But more than that... he had 
to protect Lilia.

Lilia...

Diana was losing her tolerance up above. &quot;I am waiting, Saizaki. And I 
am not bluffing!&quot;

Saizaki growled angrily, but tried to keep his cool, focusing on Lilia 
rather than Diana. &quot;I&#39;m gonna have to go and fight her.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Lilia shook her head fanatically. &quot;She&#39;ll kill you...&quot;

Saizaki sighed &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. I couldn&#39;t live with myself if I 
didn&#39;t step in. I promise that I&#39;ll win. But you have to get out of 
here. Now. Run to town. Hide there.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t leave you behind!&quot;

&quot;You have to!&quot; Saizaki yelled back, trying not to be heard, &quot;If you stay 
here, I&#39;ll just end up worrying about you and make mistakes! And I would 
never forgive myself if anything ever happened to you, Lilia. Please 
just grant me that.&quot;

Tears were stinging Lilia&#39;s eyes. &quot;...Saizaki...&quot;

Yet still, up above, Diana had lost her control. &quot;Saizaki Seisuji! Do 
you think you can play me for a fool? I swore I&#39;d kill everyone here 
unless you showed yourself to me! Now the soldiers of this army shall 
suffer the ultimate price for your cowardice!&quot;   

Saizaki&#39;s heart skipped a beat. &quot;No!&quot;

It was too late. Diana had mislaid her patience. And she was playing for 
keeps. The English woman spread her right hand open and breathed inward, 
building up her power. The wind below her grew, until it was so strong 
it was tearing through the blades of grass covering the floor of the 
forest. Energy began gathering at Diana&#39;s hand, a swirling energy that 
burned the air itself. The soldiers duelling below her were unaware of 
what she was planning to do, and so they could not have escaped. Not 
that they would have. At that point, the bloodlust of Diana was so 
strong it would have laid waste to the earth. The white-hot energy at 
Diana&#39;s hand grew and grew until a huge orb was circulating around it, 
sparks of blue lighting coursing around it violently. The woman screamed 
femininely. She pulled her hand back, than pointed it back down toward 
the battlefield as cried, 

&quot;Ragnarok!&quot;

There was no way the common soldiers could have prepared for it. The orb 
burst into an even larger sphere, and that sphere was shot down to the 
battlefield. Some of the battling warriors saw the enormous ball coming 
their way, but they would not have been able to escape it in time. By 
the time the Ragnarok touched the ground, the soldiers fighting below 
were already dead. It exploded with a kind of violence that shook the 
earth. Both Lilia and Saizaki gasped in fear and awe of the haunting 
white light that surged up from the blast point. Screams of the people 
could be heard inside it, their flesh burning, fading instantly. Their 
bodies evaporated like so much water, and the grassy ground beneath them 
was broken open. Cracks appeared in the ground as holy light purified 
the battlefield. They snaked out from the epicentre of the pure Ragnarok 
blast as the ground below it began to collapse into itself. The light 
was so bright that Saizaki and Lilia had to cover their eyes to keep 
from being blinded. Nobody who was in that forest could have ignored 
something like that. 

Soon after the blast, the echoing, thunderous impact began to fade. The 
last sounds to be heard were the sounds of airborne rocks clattering to 
the ground, accompanied by the sounds of Diana&#39;s panting. What followed 
that was a chilling silence. The campsite was gone. All the soldiers 
that were fighting there were gone. Not a shred was left of them. The 
only man who had survived have been Rainhande, most likely he set up a 
magical defence with the Lightning Tooth sword. But aside from him, 
everyone else had been killed. Including the ones that had been fighting 
for Diana. Never in his life had Saizaki seen anything like it. A woman 
so desperate for revenge that she would take out her enemies and allies 
to get her way. It was unbelievable. And Saizaki would stand for it no 
longer.

&quot;Get the hell out of here, Lilia!&quot; Saizaki&#39;s face contorted in furious 
anger, and he ran out of the bushes, drawing Fire Cutter from its 
sheath. The young man charged over to what was left of the campsite, 
which was now a wide black crater. Rainhande had been thrown into the 
trees at the other side of the crater. Most likely from the first blast. 
And floating above that crater was Diana, with an emotionless glare.

&quot;...So you finally show yourself.&quot; She spat

Words could not express the hatred he was feeling for this woman. &quot;I 
hope you rot in hell.&quot;

Diana did not waist time throwing another verbal jab. Rather she lowered 
herself to ground level. Her sandaled feet lowered to about a metre off 
the floor, the smoking crater that had been mercilessly left of it. 

&quot;You must pay for Setsuya&#39;s crimes.&quot; Diana claimed.

Flames were coursing around Saizaki&#39;s sword. &quot;What the hell kind of sick 
freak are you? Are you so fixed on a dead guy that you&#39;d kill all those 
people just to draw me out? If that Zephaniah man was anything like you, 
then he deserved to die!&quot;

Magical energy grew at Diana&#39;s hands. &quot;How dare you insult a dead man&#39;s 
memory!?&quot;

And so she acted. The ageless woman thrust her right palm forwards, and 
fired a bolt of her naturally white magical force. Saizaki saw it coming 
a mile away. He had been gathering power too.  

&quot;Burn Flow!&quot;

Saizaki slashed downwards with his sleek Fire Cutter sword, and from it 
came a waving ball of flames, straight for Diana&#39;s attack. The two 
magical forces collided at the rim of the crater, sending a flash of 
light throughout the whole forest. Diana spat when she realized that she 
had lost sight of Saizaki. The light vanished a few moments later. But 
Saizaki was nowhere to be seen. Until...

&quot;Yaaah!&quot;

Diana&#39;s attention when up, along with her eyes and hands, as Saizaki 
descended from above, his sword at the ready. The Fire Cutter clashed 
with an invisible force before it could hit her squarely. Saizaki 
scowled when he realized that she still had those invisible magic 
defences. The boy leapt away from Diana, and vaulted over the left of 
the crater, which still looked scalding hot. His focus remained on her, 
and his sword was at the ready. If nothing else, Saizaki had the Fire 
Cutter&#39;s magic to rely on. 

The Japanese youth pointed at Diana. &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill you if it&#39;s the 
last thing I do!&quot;

He then rushed in with all the fierceness of his father, his 
predecessor, Setsuya. Diana noted the similarities between. Notably the 
will to fight. But that would not stop her revenge. She waited for 
Setsuya as she floated above the ground. The boy yelled a great battle 
cry, akin to that of a tiger, and slashed at the woman in all forms 
possible. From the right, from the left, diagonally, vertically, stabs, 
slashes  Each one expertly timed. The kind of timing you would expect 
from a student of Setsuya and Aarin. But each blow fell on deaf ears. 
Diana&#39;s hands performed all sorts of gestures and movements, and each 
one of those brought up a particular barrier to defend against each 
strike. For every speedy strike that Saizaki made, Diana had a movement 
to block it. After one final slash, Saizaki leapt away from the 
sorceress and jumped back to his first position, at the tip of the 
crater. His boots touched the rim, and Saizaki paused for a moment, 
drawing in momentum from his spirit and determination. Flames burst open 
around the blade of the Fire Cutter again. Saizaki swung the sword up 
and the down against the floor, lips screaming for a second time, 

&quot;Burn Flow!&quot;

A second wave of volcanic fire surged from the sword and towards Diana. 
The woman was fully prepared for this technique. She crossed her arms 
over her chest, then spread them open each of her limbs pointing in a 
different direction. The Burn Flow reached Diana but was smashed into 
cinders and embers by another of Diana&#39;s invisible defences. Soon what 
was left of the Burn Flow dissipated as if it were never there. Diana 
was just about to taunt Saizaki about his lack of variety But she then 
realized that he was gone. Her smooth marble eyes searched for him 
Around the crater, near the trees. But there was no sign of him. Diana 
continued the search until something rumbled. She looked to her left, 
where the sound was coming from. A tree. It was just about to collapse 
in her direction. Diana extended her hand, balled it into a fist, and 
then brought it downwards. An energy slash cut through the tree before 
it could touch her. But then...

&quot;Yaaah!&quot;

Saizaki came at her again! Diana swerved to her back to see the young 
soldier rushing towards her with his sword at the ready. But it was too 
fast an action to dodge or block All Diana managed to do was tilt her 
head backwards. Saizaki scowled in frustration, as the blade past over 
her face and chest almost in slow motion. The two alternated and Saizaki 
jumped over the crater to the western side of it. Diana was about to 
attack, until she noticed Saizaki grinning.

&quot;What are you smiling about?&quot; She yelled.

Saizaki pointed to her face. &quot;Got a little something on your cheek 
there.&quot;

Diana held a hand to her cheek. When she felt nothing she put her hand 
on the other one. That was when she felt something. She pulled her small 
hand back and looked at it. There were traces of blood. Saizaki had 
managed to cut her after all. But purely from the wind resistance. Just 
that, and he managed to cut her. 

Saizaki&#39;s smile made a welcomed return. &quot;Not so invincible now, are you, 
darling?&quot; 

&quot;No more games!&quot; She retorted in anger. &quot;I have had enough of you!&quot;

The Japanese man was just about to contest that. He pulled his sword 
back up into attacking position and was about to lunge in to strike. It 
took him a second to realize that he could not move. Saizaki struggled 
and struggled, even to so much as wiggle his nose, but he was paralysed. 
Diana&#39;s eyes glowed with vigour, as she held him in place with magical 
force. She Diana. The mistress of hidden magic. There was no way she was 
going to allow this upstart to make a fool of her Not unless she wanted 
something to end this cursed sadness... The blonde woman floated over 
the crater towards Saizaki. They were face to face in seconds. She 
sneered at him. 

Then spat her saliva in his face. 

&quot;The son of Seisuji, eh?&quot; She jabbed at the frozen youth, &quot;You&#39;re just a 
novice.&quot;

Saizaki couldn&#39;t do anything but let Diana&#39;s spittle dribble down his 
cheek. But, he did find that he could speak. &quot;...At... least... I-I&#39;m 
not... a... heart...less... murderer... of his... own allies...&quot;

Diana drew back her hand and slapped the boy. &quot;Silence!&quot;

His cheek grew red as it jerked back from Diana&#39;s hand. But Saizaki 
still could not move. From the current position of his head, he was 
looking the direction that he emerged from. And his heartbeat raced as 
he saw Lilia standing there. With the Wind Soul in hand. The girl 
released a gust of wind from the blade, obviously her Whirlwind Slash 
technique. The miniature twister went straight for Diana. But she blew 
the thing away with one effortless slap of her wrist. Lilia was, 
however, undaunted in her will to defend Saizaki. 

&quot;Leave him alone!&quot; The soldier girl yelled.

Diana stared at her. &quot;Stupid girl. Get away! I have no business 
with-gah!?&quot;

In the seconds that Diana had let her concentration waver, Saizaki 
launched the butt of his sword at the woman&#39;s face, breaking him free 
from her paralysing magical grip. Saizaki ran around the rim of the 
crater towards Lilia, so he could get her the hell out of there. But 
Diana recovered in seconds. The first and last Deity sneered once more, 
then gathered power into the fists she gripped together Saizaki ran and 
ran, desperate to get to Lilia before Diana could. The English sorceress 
pushed both arms forward with spread hands, unleashing a bolt of her 
signature white magical power. It swirled into an arrow-shape, 
travelling straight across the crater while Saizaki ran around it. The 
two forces rushed to meet with Lilia first. Something was going to be 
struck down. And they were. It just happened to be Saizaki.

&quot;Gaaah!&quot;
 
The young man screamed in pain as Diana&#39;s arrow-like bolt struck him 
dead-centre in the ribs. He was diving to save Lilia. And he had done. 
By taking the blow for her. Saizaki collapsed to the ground, dropping 
the Fire Cutter in the process. The way he landed was stomach down. A 
gasp escaped his throat when his face smacked the blackened grass. 

&quot;Lilia...&quot; He mumbled, his body wracked with pain. &quot;...Get... away...&quot;

Lilia Lemieux Morin was chilled to the bone. Saizaki had been injured. 
And he was struggling to move. All her allies had been killed. And 
Rainhande was unconscious over in the bushes. All thanks to Diana. Not 
only had she obliterated what was left of the Special Mission Corps, she 
had brought harm to her friends. Even Saizaki, the man she...

Fate always has a twist. And though neither Lilia nor Diana were 
realizing it, one was about to happen. Lilia looked over at the floating 
Diana, her eyes burning with unhidden hatred. Her fists were shaking, 
her heart was pounding, her throat dry as a bone All symptoms of a hate 
that transcended hate itself. Lilia&#39;s eyes flashed a dark blue, blocking 
out all other tones in her previously bright orbs. The girl was not 
thinking, but subconscious, her latent mind did all the work for her. It 
was like she was in a trance. Saizaki watched but could do nothing but 
that. Lilia&#39;s soft hands pointed towards Diana, dropping the Wind Soul. 
And in seconds things began happening as the French girl screamed the 
words, 

&quot;Charade Sphere!&quot; 

Lilia&#39;s body began glowing with luminosity so strong rivalled that of 
Diana&#39;s Ragnarok attack. And this light was cast from her body in a 
gigantic dome of golden light. It passed over Saizaki and Rainhande like 
water, but to Diana it was as corrosive as acid. She was dumbstruck. Was 
the this girl using...?

&quot;Impossible!&quot;

Diana yelled this as she strained to hold back the blocking force of the 
Charade Sphere. But it was too much, even for her. Diana&#39;s throat 
released a horrific cry of fear as she was thrown way back by the force 
of the sphere. Out of the forest and whirling endlessly as far as the 
energy could toss her. The sphere eventually engulfed the entire forest, 
but did nothing to harm it or its inhabitants. And when the sphere faded 
away, Lilia&#39;s eyes reverted from dark blue to light blue, then closed 
completely. Her body fainted from the shock. Lilia collapsed to her 
knees then to her stomach, left unconscious.  Saizaki stared at her in 
utter disbelief. It was impossible. Was Lilia...

...a magic-user?
