<a href="../original/allgirls-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>&quot;Two Very Bitter Break-ups&quot;

Hitomi Madsen woke up cradling her own student, the pale and beautiful 
Lilian Nachtheim, for the sixth time. Her expression became sad, and 
loving: Lilian looked so peaceful laying there, her arms curled around 
her teacher&#39;s body desperately. Her ghostly pale-pink skin, sealed eyes 
of dying-sun, and long strands of pale winter-wheat made her look 
heartbreakingly gorgeous; even in the comfort of the older woman&#39;s 
morning hug, she looked happy and wounded and too lost in the balance to 
care. Hitomi gave into the desire to caress her face, parting stray 
lines of hair. With some effort, she slipped her student from her grasp, 
touched her lips, and let her fingers go to her own mouth as she moved 
to her humble bathroom.

She was both naked and nude in moments. Hitomi paused just briefly as 
she hoisted her waist-length hair, jetty according to her Oriental 
heritage, high above her face. With arms and chest stretched out like 
that, she couldn&#39;t help but take an appraising glance in the mirror. 
Five feet and five inches (1.65 meters), one-hundred six pounds (48 
kilos), and healthfully into her twenty-fifth year, Madsen was an image 
of loveliness and what many perceived as feminine near-perfection. She 
wore glasses, but not in the shower; she had a chance to look at her 
hazel eyes, along with the rest of her.

&quot;Hitomi dear girl,&quot; she said with a proud smile, &quot;you&#39;re doing good.&quot; 
Madsen closed her eyes and let her hair fall. She&#39;d pin it up that day; 
wearing it down wasn&#39;t always the professional choice. She twisted the 
two knobs in her shower that sprayed hot and cold water, reaching her 
hand inside to test it until it was just right. She grabbed a mirror 
from the sink and put one foot in, then drew it out.

Hitomi needed a Release.

She reached for her Self, winced just slightly, and breathed. She 
surrendered and slowly prodded, or jabbed, or stretched, or pinched, and 
her mind wandered. Lilian. She fantasized wildly about Lilian. She 
fantasized about the sexy young woman strolling in wearing a robe, one 
of her robes, a sultry smile on her otherwise meek face. She imagined 
Lilian saying nothing as she let the robe loosen and fall down, exposing 
a column of naked porcelain skin; she imagined Lilian taking her 
desperately and washing her whole body with her own bare hands. She and 
Lilian made love like wild animals, and crawled out of the shower with 
their mouths hungrily groping after each other, kissing until they were 
both dried.

Hitomi made a face mixed from exhaustion, exhilaration, and 
dissatisfaction as she achieved orgasm, and stepped inside her tub. The 
shower in &quot;real life&quot; was uneventful and quick. She was shaved, soaped, 
and shampooed quickly, and was out within the hour&#39;s end. She dried and 
changed into something new, then combed her hair, swabbed her wet ears, 
and brushed her teeth. She was ready for the next day of school, and her 
student, Lilian, the woman she had allowed to stay over again,was still 
in bed.

She noticeably sighed and nudged the unresponsive heap. Lilian groaned 
and tossed until her hair became disheveled. Hitomi frowned and nudged 
rougher. Finally, Lilian stirred, smiling with unconditional love as she 
looked up into the wise, beautiful, steady face of her teacher and love 
interest. Madsen&#39;s heart broke with love, and for a moment, she wondered 
if she could make her fantasy real.

She knew she had to end that relationship.

Today. It would be today, before school.

But she had promised herself that before, and every time she did, the 
&quot;magnificent Madsen&quot; failed. Lilian made her weak and needy like no drug 
ever could; her only desire was to hold the younger woman, caress her 
face, and envelop her in kisses until they were both lost and fell 
asleep, naked in each other&#39;s&#151;

She shook her head. Today. She would.

&quot;Wake up, Lilian,&quot; she said quietly. Lilian forced herself to sit up, 
and stretched. She scratched her neck and stomach, rubbed her face, and 
gave her teacher a dusky smile. Madsen&#39;s legs turned to pudding.

Steady, girl. You can do this. So what if her face is captivating? So 
what that when every time she looks at you like that, you know she needs 
you and only wants to love you? So what if she would be perfect, so 
perfect for you, so perfect and so scandalously wrong, only a few months 
too young. Just a few months. She would be eighteen in January. It could 
work. You know you love her.

&quot;You had better make your shower quick,&quot; she advised her. &quot;I&#39;d like to 
speak with you, please. Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ve got time, and I&#39;ll drive you 
to school.&quot;

Just don&#39;t lose your nerve and join her. Don&#39;t even look at the bathroom 
door. Make sure she takes her change of clothes with her.

&quot;And breakfast?&quot; managed Lilian with a yawn. Madsen floundered for 
ideas.

&quot;Um, orange slices, toast, salmon sandwich...&quot;

&quot;For breakfast?&quot;

&quot;Salmon is very good for you. Besides, I hardly ever have anything left 
at the end of the week. Unless you&#39;d like breakfast at school...&quot;

&quot;Salmon sounds good. Bye.&quot; She smiled, waved, and was gone. Moments 
later, Hitomi could hear the water running and her so-called 
&quot;girlfriend&quot; humming. She took a breath meant to strengthen herself, and 
another. She began breakfast and started rehearsing what she would say 
to Lilian once they were both settled and attentive. She had to end 
their relationship, now. If Lilian were just a year older and not her 
student, there would be no hesitation at all: Hitomi would&#39;ve gladly 
made the younger woman her lover. She adored shy girls, and could see 
that Miss Nachtheim, though as reclusive as one could get, was 
passionate and pure on the inside. She kept things hidden; Hitomi knew 
her love could be the key to opening her up.

But she was not legal age yet. She was 17, eighteen in a mere four 
months, on her way to graduation. If Hitomi began a relationship with 
her, there would be trouble for them both, from legal to domestic. She 
would be fired or imprisoned, or both, and Lilian would be expelled, or 
at best, harshly disciplined by her parents and transferred. Hitomi 
didn&#39;t have the heart to do that to her worst enemy, let alone somebody 
she cared for with such depth.

Age was only part of the terrible equation: Lilian was also her student. 
Hitomi was fully aware that many of her students eyed her, even those 
who considered themselves heterosexual. Some had been brave enough to 
make passes at her, others she knew talked about her as more than an 
object of admiration. She let those glide over her skin, but Lilian... 
It was a whole other story there. She could be fired or imprisoned for 
liaisons with a student, and Lilian...

The result was the same in both situations. If only Lilian were older, 
and in college, learning from some other woman... But she wasn&#39;t. She 
was here, at this school, at that age, and up until ten&#151;fifteen minutes 
ago, she had been in Hitomi&#39;s bed. In a tee and panties. Clutching the 
older woman like a lover. Kissing her. They had made out a little too 
heavily the previous night: Hitomi still shuddered when she remembered 
the albino&#39;s breath on her neck, her gentle hands touching her face, her 
lips gasping and clutching at will, her waist shifting into the early 
stages of gyration...

Hitomi shook her head clear of such thoughts, and for good measure, she 
washed her face and drank some water. She breathed carefully. Lilian had 
felt so good... but it was all wrong. She was only grateful they had not 
gotten past heavy kissing and very mild petting. If they had made love, 
like she secretly wanted to...

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she whispered to herself, rubbing her face again. &quot;I&#39;ve got 
to end this relationship now. It&#39;s too addicting. We&#39;ll both be in 
trouble if I don&#39;t.&quot; She knew Lilian certainly wouldn&#39;t be the one to 
end it. She was the love-starved one, the &quot;empty shell&quot; that Hitomi had 
apparently filled, the great scar that had been sewn up and healed&#151;she 
would not stop. In that sense, the senior-class woman was na&iuml;ve and 
perhaps even foolish, so it was up to Hitomi, who knew better. She had 
felt that sting before; she did not want to feel it again.

So she finished breakfast and waited. She heard the water turn off. 
Today. Soon. It would be today. As soon as they were ready. No kisses, 
no touches, no longing stares. Business. Cold, yes; cruel, yes; 
necessary, yes. It would break both their hearts, but it had to be done. 
Lilian&#151;no, they both needed to be around women their own age (or in 
Hitomi&#39;s case, men and women). Yes, that seemed better. Of course, 
Hitomi knew she could easily find a lover herself, but Lilian would be 
another matter. She could only pray that the girl had found a friend 
during all those assignments she made her go on. Surely one of those 
girls she had studied loved her for the same reasons Hitomi did. Surely.

Today. She just kept reminding herself. Today. Today. Soon.

Now.

............

Now. She would have to do it now. Ayanna Montgomery had to break up with 
her girlfriend now. She and Gabrielle had gone out together for about a 
month--purely out of chance when the two met in gym class--discussed a 
few things, and figured it would be good to have girlfriends again. 
Ayanna liked Gabrielle, but she was too much like a friend and not 
enough like a lover. Gabrielle liked cuddling and holding hands, gentle 
shy kisses and shared silence, or days where they just hung out and did 
as they pleased. It was something a close friend would do, but not a 
potential lover. Besides, honestly, Gabrielle was not her type. Despite 
her perky persona, the young Irish lass was really very bashful when it 
came to romance, and Ayanna wanted somebody a little... wilder.

Not that there hadn&#39;t been moments, but they had only been moments, and 
fleeting at that. Gabrielle proved herself feisty at times, and even 
insane with just a whisper of perversion (she remembered one recent 
night where they had made out on the couch, and the young redhead&#39;s 
hands slipped under Ayanna&#39;s shirt. Montgomery didn&#39;t mind and in fact 
wanted to go on, but the poor O&#39;Shannon apologized, turned hot pink, and 
gathered her senses and belongings to leave). But she was a friend, and 
when it came down to it, the girls really didn&#39;t know each other.

She shared drama and gym with the other girl, but they usually met 
outside the school building before their first classes. She would tell 
her then and get it over with. They would both probably be heartbroken 
because of it, but it had to be done. Ayanna just didn&#39;t feel like 
Gabrielle could be a good romantic partner, at least not for her. She 
just finished composing herself and convincing herself not to cave in 
for the third time when she saw the sprightly young woman skipping 
towards her, gay and full of life. She was wearing an adorable 
purple-blue turtleneck, the color of ripe raisins, and her standard 
jeans-that-had-been-ripped (these by accident; they were her favorite).

Ayanna accepted her hug, but shied away from the kiss.

&quot;Hey, somethin&#39; wrong?&quot; asked O&#39;Shannon. She looked happy, not that she 
ever seemed depressed or down, least not for long. Ayanna frowned.

&quot;Well, put that way, erm... yeah.&quot;

&quot;You wanna tell me about it? Here, walk me to class.&quot; Ayanna&#39;s head 
nodded. She had been taught by Madsen before, so she knew the way. As 
they walked, Gabrielle grinned and slipped her hand into Ayanna&#39;s grip, 
meshing pale-pink fingers with dark. Ayanna sighed and reasoned that she 
was going to miss such sweet intimacy&#151;but she regained control and 
forced her hand away gently.

&quot;Listen, Gab,&quot; she began, &quot;it&#39;s about us.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that make-out session we had?&quot; Her face turned rouge. &quot;Listen, I&#39;m 
real sorry I got carried away. I ain&#39;t never done that before, and I 
kinda liked it, and I kinda didn&#39;t even know what I was doin&#39;, and I&#39;m 
real sorry I made ya feel uncomfor&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s not that,&quot; she interrupted. &quot;It&#39;s, well...&quot;

............

&quot;I think we should discontinue our relationship.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Lilian didn&#39;t even allow for silence, or reason. Hitomi picked at 
her fried egg, keeping away from the younger woman&#39;s heartbreaking red 
stare.

&quot;You know very well why,&quot; she answered, sounding more like 
Teacher-Madsen than Friend-Hitomi. &quot;You&#39;re my student, I&#39;m your teacher. 
It&#39;s wrong. Even if you weren&#39;t, you&#39;re far too young for me. I don&#39;t 
mind the age difference itself, it&#39;s just that... it&#39;s not really proper 
for a woman my age to be consorting with ladies underneath eighteen 
years.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Please, Lilian, think about it!&quot; she implored. Lilian nearly blurted 
out again, but she stopped herself and let reason take over. Then she 
covered her eyes, hiding the small tears. Hitomi&#151;Miss Madsen was right, 
and it hurt because she was right. Deep in her mind, even Lilian knew 
that what they had been doing was wrong, but she didn&#39;t care. Somebody 
had finally reached out to her, drew her close, held her tight, loved 
her for what she was, and had seen the pure, simple soul beneath that no 
other human had. She had loved Hitomi, almost from the start, and now...

She could not be with her because of cruel circumstance.

If only she were older. If only she had already graduated. If only, if 
only...

Hitomi badly wanted to reach her hand out, touch Lilian&#39;s beautiful 
frail face, comb away her hair and kiss back her tears, but she had to 
be cold. If she submitted to weakness, everything would be for naught. 
She held back and drank her coffee, leaving Lilian to face this dark new 
problem on her own.

&quot;In time you may thank me for what I&#39;ve done,&quot; she whispered firmly. &quot;I 
don&#39;t like this anymore than you do, but we can&#39;t be together. I know a 
woman like you will recover. You can easily find another lover, somebody 
your own age, who understands you and sees you as a beautiful person.&quot;

&quot;That will not happen,&quot; moaned poor Lilian. She uncovered her face and 
stared at her teacher, her eyes bloodshot. &quot;Look at me! I&#39;m ugly!&quot;

&quot;I disagree,&quot; replied Madsen coldly. &quot;Now I&#39;ll have no more false 
assumptions, no more self-pity out of you. It&#39;s not becoming. Come, eat 
your breakfast; I&#39;ll drive you to school once you&#39;re ready. Hopefully we 
can put our immediate past behind us and behave properly, as a teacher 
and student should.&quot;

&quot;Where will I go at night?&quot; she wondered weakly. &quot;What will I do? I hate 
going home, I have no friends, I loved this place so...&quot; Madsen sipped 
her coffee again.

&quot;You won&#39;t go here, at least not in the way you once did. As a friend, 
and infrequently, perhaps. I shouldn&#39;t have let you stay over in the 
first place, but that&#39;s my fault. I felt I needed to... well, it was my 
fault, and I apologize. You&#39;re a strong woman, Lilian&#151;Miss Nachtheim. 
You&#39;ll adjust. Now, no more.&quot;

&quot;But my parents&#151;&quot;

&quot;No more,&quot; she repeated, her voice still calm and quiet. It trembled a 
tiny fraction as she added, &quot;Hopefully they have not grown too worried, 
and they won&#39;t come sniffing around. I can only pray that our 
relationship&#39;s brevity did it some credit, because if people were to 
find out...&quot; She leaned forward, and just in case Lilian didn&#39;t know, or 
she needed to be reminded of why Hitomi was letting her go, she 
emphasized, &quot;Then I would be fired or imprisoned, and you would be 
expelled or transferred. That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this. Neither of us wants 
that.&quot; The albino shook her head.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then it&#39;s agreed.&quot; Hitomi crossed her legs and finished her coffee. 
Lilian managed to chew her orange slices absently. The minutes came and 
went. They said nothing until it was time to leave. Lilian was quiet for 
her part, all the way back to school and class. When the two women came 
to Madsen&#39;s room, they found Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon crying softly outside.

&quot;Good morning, Miss O&#39;Shannon,&quot; said Miss Madsen, using her most 
professional tone. She unlocked the door to her room and let the first 
two students inside, asking briefly, &quot;Is anything the matter?&quot;

&quot;Oh... just relational problems, ma&#39;am.&quot; She nodded her head, her mouth 
curving slightly in empathy before she left them in privacy. As a very 
wise, very dear person had told her once, friendship was a good salve 
for emotional wounds, and O&#39;Shannon&#39;s report on Lilian indicated she had 
grown fond of the older woman. Hitomi could only hope.

............

&quot;But why?&quot;

The only answer Ayanna had was every reason she had gone over in her 
head, minutes earlier. Gabrielle was more friend than girlfriend, more 
buddy than lover, and certainly not her type. Inwardly she was sweet, 
gentle, and just the tiniest bit shy, despite being the most outspoken 
member of her &quot;group&quot;. Ayanna tended to like girls who were more 
assertive, more sure of themselves during romantic situations&#151;heck, more 
romantic, period. And finally, she didn&#39;t know much more about Gabrielle 
than she had when they first dated, except for the basics and maybe a 
few mild secrets.

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Listen, I don&#39;t wanna make this hard,&quot; murmured Ayanna, crossing her 
arms in defense. &quot;We&#39;ve had some fun together, and now I think maybe 
it&#39;s time we break up and see other people. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re not my type; 
I really can&#39;t see you as anything better than a friend. Besides, with 
you being so close to Liv and all, it&#39;s almost like I&#39;m dating my 
cousin.&quot; Ayanna had a solid point, and Gabrielle could not argue with 
the logic, except at times by using a frail But.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Ayanna gently, resting her hand on the redhead&#39;s 
shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t mean to hurt you; I really like you, just not... in a 
romantic way. Do you hate me?&quot; Gabrielle had a few small tears in her 
eyes, but she blinked them away and gave a strong sigh.

&quot;No, of course not. You&#39;re just the second girl who&#39;s broken up with me 
in a year, I think&#151;maybe two years, I dunno. I just... feel there may be 
somethin&#39; wrong with me.&quot; Ayanna gave her an encouraging smile, and to 
add to it, a hug.

&quot;Hey, there&#39;s nothin&#39; wrong with you. You&#39;re just not the girl for me. 
But somewhere out there&#151;&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, the ol&#39; &#39;I&#39;ll find somebody eventually&#39; routine. Eh, I 
don&#39;t mean to sound bitter, just discouraged. Look, you get on to class 
and maybe, a week or two from now, find someone you like&#151;maybe a leggy 
blonde. I&#39;ll be all right. You know I&#39;ll bounce back.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot; Gabrielle gave her a nod of confidence, and the two now-ex 
girlfriends parted in peace with silent waves, Ayanna going to her first 
hour class. Gabrielle sighed and wiped her face dry, then noticed Miss 
Madsen and Lilian approaching the classroom door together. She tried not 
to look a mess as she greeted them.

&quot;Good morning, Miss O&#39;Shannon,&quot; said Miss Madsen, using her most 
professional tone. She unlocked the door to her room and let them both 
inside, asking briefly, &quot;Is anything the matter?&quot;

&quot;Oh... just relational problems, ma&#39;am.&quot; The teacher nodded her head, 
giving her a kind smile of empathy before leaving. Miss Madsen always 
had the door unlocked, but didn&#39;t join class until a few seconds after 
it started. Only one person knew where she went between the unlocking 
ceremony and first bell, the kind of person who loved meeting her friend 
early on to discuss their latest interests, capers, and troubles&#151;and 
would Hitomi have a story to unload that morning!

&quot;You have a bad day too?&quot; asked Gabrielle of Lilian once they were 
settled and seated. The albino nodded, causing the younger girl to move 
out of her seat and join her. &quot;Well, I figure if we tell each other 
bout&#39; our bad days, maybe they won&#39;t be so bad. You first.&quot;</pre>
