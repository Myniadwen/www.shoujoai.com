&quot;Will you excuse me?&quot; she asked placidly, giving Erica a glance as she 
took some papers in hand. &quot;I&#39;ve got some homework to do. May I have some 
privacy?&quot;

&quot;Oh, uh, sure. Is there anything I can do?&quot;

&quot;No, just make yourself at home. Mom should be here shortly with 
dinner.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot; Jocelyn walked out of the den and into the hallway, where 
she dove into her door and disappeared. Erica chewed on her lip and 
resigned herself to sitting on the couch&#151;and waited. &quot;I hope I know what 
I&#39;m doing,&quot; she murmured to herself.
The Protest

&quot;Part Three: Jericho&quot;

It was a genius, albeit unusual idea, and it was all Amina&#39;s. She had 
spent the night at Nomi&#39;s small house, sketching and talking and 
becoming closer to a girl she considered her best friend, and came up 
with the whole thing while idly drawing a castle. Stanton was a bit like 
a castle, she had mused: it had its rulers, its workers, a large 
population and kind of a domineering yet awe-inspiring presence. Castles 
were more romantic, noted Nomi; Amina agreed, and then it came to her.

Jericho. The girls would reenact the famous battle of Jericho&#151;but 
instead of swords and bows, they would carry picket signs and banners, 
and every morning for six days, including the weekend, they would march 
around the school once. On the seventh day, they would go around it 
seven times, blow their instruments, and see what came of it. Hopefully, 
as Jericho had, the school would not crumble to pieces&#151;but if it did, 
what a display it would&#39;ve been!

Nomi thought she was nuts, but went along with it anyway.

Hero, Jocelyn, Usha, and all their loved ones and the volunteers each 
took position at a table, passing out picket signs and banners for 
everyone. Many of Janet Keys&#39; students had made the signs by hand; they 
read such things as &quot;Women against the war&quot;, &quot;The Badgers will fight the 
draft&quot;, &quot;I didn&#39;t vote for no draft&quot;, &quot;Bring our soldiers home NOW&quot;, and 
so on. Nearly everyone took a sign. After hearing just how seriously 
Bush was considering reinstating the draft, even the indifferent women 
of the school started carrying signs. The march would not take place 
until either one-hundred people were there or else the entire school 
population was.

Hero had greeted everyone and asked that they form a kind of ring all 
the way around the building, and told them to wait until they heard the 
signal before marching. Her hair was dyed red on one side, blue on the 
other, and had white streaks running everywhere; Usha had a shirt with 
the Statue of Liberty on the front and the Statue of Justice on the back 
(fittingly, both were female); Jocelyn wore a custom-made sweater with 
the words &quot;In Loving Memory&quot; sketched on them, and below was a picture 
of her deceased boyfriend. Grim, but effective&#151;she was getting flowers 
and condolences from everyone.

Corona Marcos walked up and picked out a sign that read &quot;Give me peace 
or give me death!&quot;, and grinned as she held it up. She searched for one 
she thought Alexandra would like, and pulled out one that screamed 
&quot;Don&#39;t tread on me!&quot; with the Peace sign broken in several bits. She 
gave it to Blair, brushing her hand as well. Blair thanked Marcos and, 
taking her hand, went to find a space in the gathering crowd.

&quot;Whaddya got?&quot; asked Ana Lu, foraging through the piles. She already had 
several small banners attached to her waist, wrists, and neck, but 
wanted a sign to throw up. Rai Zanders was not far away; she saw Ana and 
felt oddly tempted to join her. She cleared her throat and picked out a 
single yellow banner to wave. Her thoughts briefly turned toward the 
friend she had made during summer vacation&#151;how the other girl had 
actually wanted to join up with something like this&#151;and wondered how she 
was doing. Rai ignored Ana and took her place; Lu eventually gave up 
looking and just decorated herself with another banner.

They were going faster than the artists could make them. Soon, quantity 
became more important than quality, and many signs were plastered with 
ink only to be stolen away a second later. In spite of the large number 
of artists, those who had come to protest severely outnumbered them. 
Ayanna, Erica, Blake, and Mira, being obviously connected to the chief 
speakers, were now elevated to a higher status as they oversaw the 
construction. A few girls donated banners and flags; these were consumed 
easily.

&quot;Wow,&quot; said Ethan Nikholai, his eyes bulging. &quot;Look at that! I didn&#39;t 
expect such a large crowd.&quot; His girlfriend Avelina sucked on her lip.

&quot;Neither did I, and I go to school here. Come on.&quot;

&quot;Wait.&quot; She had already hopped out of the car, and was leaning against 
it as he spoke to her. &quot;Avi, standing up for what you believe in is all 
well and good, but don&#39;t you think you&#39;re being a bit... I mean, 
rebellious? I mean, look: I love you, but I love this country too. It&#39;s 
taken me in when I had nothing but a name, and it&#39;s given me everything 
a man could want, and more. I just don&#39;t feel comfortable saying bad 
things about it, even if I am against the war.&quot; She smiled tenderly, 
took his hand, and kissed him.

&quot;Beautiful Ethan,&quot; she sighed dreamily. &quot;Worry not, love. I know how you 
feel. It&#39;s as if this rolling stone has finally taken root and is 
growing some moss. I&#39;m in no means against this country, or the people 
who fight to protect it. I&#39;m just against a war that&#39;s gone on longer 
than necessary, and the draft. We&#39;re not in danger, love, but people we 
know are. Come on, we&#39;ll find a nice peaceful sign.&quot;

&quot;As you wish,&quot; he said, following her as she led him by hand (neither 
could go very quickly). They wove through the crowds and waited in line; 
meanwhile, Kula Nanahara spotted them and waved.

&quot;Ya here to give this country a kick in the ass too?&quot;

&quot;No, just the war.&quot;

&quot;Bah!&quot; she snorted. &quot;This country stinks. Hawaii may as well have its 
own nationality. I was better off there anyway. I hear you two aren&#39;t 
native to this place either.&quot;

&quot;No, I was born in Brazil, and lived some of my life in Portugal,&quot; said 
Avelina. Ethan nodded politely.

&quot;As for me, I was born in Russia, and moved here when I was fifteen.&quot;

&quot;Ya both speak pretty good American garbage,&quot; remarked the skater with a 
grin. &quot;Course&#39;, I ain&#39;t calling it English, since, well...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not in England,&quot; said about twenty-to-thirty nearby students, 
most of whom had had Miss Madsen as a teacher. Kula grinned and made a 
gesture. It was her turn next, and fittingly enough, she had been led to 
the table that Usha ran. The Hawaiian native looked at Krishnan blankly, 
crossing her arms expectantly. She kept her eyes on the older girl as 
she fished around for a sign, found a good one, and said &quot;Thanks&quot; before 
joining the crowd.

&quot;Well,&quot; remarked Mira, &quot;that was peaceful.&quot;

Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the Israelites. No one went 
out and no one came in. Then the Lord said to Joshua, &quot;See, I have 
delivered Jericho into your hands, along with its king and its fighting 
men. March around the city once with all the armed men. Do this for six 
days. Have seven priests carry trumpets of rams&#39; horns in front of the 
ark. On the seventh day, march around the city seven times, with the 
priests blowing the trumpets. When you hear them sound a long blast on 
the trumpets, have all the people give a loud shout; then the wall of 
the city will collapse and the people will go up, every man straight 
in.&quot; --Joshua 6:1-6

&quot;Of course,&quot; said Hero, &quot;I&#39;m sure Stanton won&#39;t crumble or anything&#151;I 
hope it doesn&#39;t&#151;but at least we&#39;ll have an impact. I&#39;m actually glad we 
thought of such a unique way to match Miss Marbel&#39;s challenge. Someone 
go thank Amina; she should be at the front of the line.&quot; By the time the 
crowd was at its peak, nearly thirty minutes before 8:00, it had gotten 
so thick that even by forming a ring around the school, they were still 
massive. Most of them had been informed that Amina had constructed the 
idea, and embarrassed her several times over with their congratulatory 
remarks.

The three speakers looked over the crowd, took the hands of their 
respective counterparts (be they lovers or friends), joined in, and as 
one, Stanton took the first step together in a long march, with seven 
members of the band in front with instruments. Bernadette Marbel, 
content to watch, took in a deep breath and shivered in the cold.

&quot;Day one, girls,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;Good luck.&quot;
Day Two

By now, Lilian Nachtheim knew the school pretty well, but marching 
around it on a cold early November morning proved that even she had 
things to learn. Of course, the world looked much happier and more alive 
when a pretty redhead with an apron fetish was clutching her arm, and it 
seemed bolder with a sign reading &quot;Buy food, not arms&quot; occupying her 
free hand. As the two of them marched around the building, arm in arm, 
Gabrielle snuck in a kiss and whispered softly.

&quot;This isn&#39;t so bad. Fresh air, exercise, friends, a beautiful 
girlfriend...&quot; Lilian quietly agreed. Gabrielle was wonderful for her, 
nearly perfect in ways of a match, and any time they spent together, 
even outside on a nonromantic quest like this, was a treasure. Her 
touch, her bright smile, her gorgeous sparkling eyes, that kiss and that 
hug... it was everything she could&#39;ve wanted, right from the 
least-expected source. Lilian had once thought she was in love with Miss 
Madsen, but that was silly and outdated. They both needed to be around 
women their own age, and happy circumstance saw to it that they did.

Yes, even Hitomi was out there, braving the cold as she marched with one 
hand clasping Abby&#39;s and the other a small flag. Their students were 
happy to see their teachers out with them, supporting their cause. It 
was the perfect way to be a role model, Keeping had said, and from that 
day on, many of the young people there looked up to them. Leena was 
there too, openly holding Kathlyn&#39;s hand, and the entire soccer team 
followed them around the school, from front to back and all around.

Aside from their footfalls, the group was eerily quiet. It had been 
agreed that there would be no talking, no shouting or cheering, unless 
absolutely necessary. The protest would be a peaceful one, quiet but 
provocative; the sheer numbers and determination of the girls would act 
as their voice. The previous day, everyone had been asked to keep the 
picket signs they had so they could be used the next day, and more were 
made at home and in art class, but even these were depleted as more 
people came to let their voice&#151;or rather, their march&#151;be heard.

Once around, then a speech was given, and the girls were sent inside to 
resume classes. Marbel had encouraged them to go to school so their 
cause would be clear&#151;protest, yes, but responsibly. Most of the crowd 
dispersed quietly, but some returned to their cars, heading home or else 
to their own school. Apparently, word had traveled quickly about the 
strange form of protest, and many other people had joined since.
Day Three

&quot;Whoa,&quot; said Tristan Reeves, taking a good long look at the ring of 
people around the school. &quot;You weren&#39;t kidding, Farrah. There are a lot 
of people here.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. Join me and I&#39;ll forgive you for ditching me.&quot;

&quot;Come on, honey, you know I had a good reason.&quot; She ignored him and went 
ahead, hoisting her sign above. They wove through the parking lot and 
came across a group of people who were watching. Most of them were 
curious onlookers, some just men come to &quot;see the lesbians&quot;.

&quot;Dude, check it out!&quot; said one, pointing to the crowd. They cackled and 
cheered as they saw two of the girls in the crowd exchange a brief kiss 
in mid-march. Another stopped Farrah before she could go any further.

&quot;Hey, like, do you go to this lesbian school?&quot;

&quot;Gimme a break, jerk,&quot; she snorted as she pulled away. &quot;I&#39;m straight, 
for your information, and taken.&quot;

&quot;She really is,&quot; said Tristan as he took her arm. He gave them a 
back-away glance before following his girlfriend into the crowd. The 
boys still watched and cheered, but were chased off by a few teachers. 
Andeira Torvald gave Samantha O&#39;Brien a weary look as the onlookers 
scampered away.

&quot;If word gets out that this is a place for gay girls, there could be 
trouble.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s not, right?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, but that&#39;s the official statement. Even the most na&iuml;ve 
person knows that at least seventy percent of the population in this 
school is homosexual or bisexual. I don&#39;t know why.&quot; O&#39;Brien shrugged.

&quot;Maybe the lack of men helps create a Sapphic atmosphere.&quot; She left 
Torvald with that thought and resumed her patrol of the area, keeping 
gawkers and solicitors away. Torvald crossed her arms in the cold air. A 
lack of men creating a Sapphic atmosphere? Did that explain her brief, 
destructive affair with Em McGowen? Did that explain why even the most 
heterosexual girls, exceptions withstanding, were now dabbling in their 
own gender? What did cause women to be attracted to other women anyway?

&quot;It&#39;s not for me to find out,&quot; she resolved, before turning round to 
shoo away more unwelcome folk.

&quot;Hey, Fare-fare! Hey Reevus!&quot; Ivory gave Farrah and Tristan a hug and 
welcomed them to the crowd. She briefly introduced Ancelin as her 
official girlfriend, asked them each how they were doing, and struck up 
a conversation in spite of being told not to. They kept their voices low 
as they walked around the school.

&quot;So whaddyou make of this? I mean, I heard Marbel&#39;s gonna bring a news 
van out here, but I haven&#39;t seen it yet. Anne here thinks she&#39;s just 
waiting for the last day. Man, I can&#39;t believe I have to march out here 
on a weekend just to make the news!&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to, do you?&quot; asked Tristan.

&quot;Well no, but... y&#39;know... I gotta show my support. I&#39;m as against the 
draft as anyone here. Besides, I&#39;d be torn to pieces if I was separated 
from my Annie.&quot; She looked over and gave Ancelin a cheery smile; she 
returned it shyly and squeezed Ivory&#39;s hand. &quot;And it&#39;s not bad. We keep 
each other warm in down time, don&#39;t we?&quot; She grinned and kissed 
Ancelin&#39;s cheek. Ancelin gave out a little squeal and shyly looked away. 
Farrah rolled her eyes.
Day Four

&quot;Can you believe it?&quot; said Alisha one day, several minutes before the 
march began. &quot;All these women here and I can&#39;t find one I like. Most of 
em&#39; are either too ugly, too stuck-up, or too... taken to even hit on! 
And those guys have been coming here for the past three days. You think 
they expect us to have an orgy once this is done?&quot; She looked to her 
sister, who was busy making more signs, but didn&#39;t get an answer. So she 
sighed.

&quot;Erica, talk to me. What gives? Come on, answer. You haven&#39;t been the 
same since before this whole thing started. It&#39;s like you&#39;re in another 
world. Look, I&#39;m sorry about bothering you earlier, I just thought you 
and Joss... well, you know. I mean, you don&#39;t have to say if you are a 
couple or not, just... talk to me.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll talk if you come and help,&quot; she answered.

&quot;I did help! I painted fifteen signs! Fifteen!&quot;

&quot;Then make another fifteen.&quot; Alisha gave a grunt, stormed over, and 
yanked a permanent marker from the table.

&quot;Bossy, bossy, bossy,&quot; she murmured as she started to draw. Erica 
secretly smiled and, as promised, started talking.

&quot;If you&#39;re lonely, I know of a few girls out there that are looking.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah? Who?&quot; She pointed.

&quot;You could have an affair with Miss Cerio.&quot; Alisha snorted. Tempting, 
but she wanted a girl with a little more stability.

&quot;No thanks. Next.&quot;

&quot;Olivia Johnson. She&#39;s your type.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s too sullen; next.&quot;

&quot;What about Yuki?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Erica made a face. Okay, so not too many people knew her yet.

&quot;Uh, let&#39;s see, there&#39;s... May Tramble. Word is that she thinks she&#39;s 
bisexual.&quot;

&quot;Only because she has to kiss some girl for the musical. Odds are 
they&#39;ll just end up sleeping together.&quot;

&quot;(Then I guess that rules out Janine,)&quot; murmured Erica to herself. She 
listed off a few other names: Alexis Walker, Zane Klein, Vai Knox, Kula 
Nanahara, Katt Parkin. Walker and Klein were no longer together, but 
they were hardly Alisha&#39;s type, and she didn&#39;t even know who Vai Knox 
was.

&quot;Yes you do,&quot; argued her sister, &quot;you have her in drama class. She&#39;s in 
the play, dummy!&quot;

&quot;Oh, her. God, I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s straight or not. Sides, I think she 
likes that Ave-whats-its chick.&quot;

&quot;Avelina. She&#39;s definitely straight.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll consider it,&quot; she barked. Erica winced and scooted away so 
she wouldn&#39;t be under the glare of her older sister&#39;s stare.

&quot;God,&quot; she murmured, &quot;calm down. I&#39;m just trying to help.&quot;

Vairocana had no idea people were talking about her; she was absently 
walking around the school, just behind Victoria and June (June, laden 
with signs and banners, had generously donated her wheelchair as a means 
of decoration, and sat poised with a flute ready to blow) and right in 
front of Katt and Leena. She was old enough to vote, and had went for 
Nader, since neither Kerry nor Bush appealed to her. Lately she was 
wishing she had went for Kerry&#151;if for no other reason, than to prevent 
this rally, no matter how well-meaning it was. No war meant no rally.

Her parents had went with her, taking some time off from their jobs, and 
wisely distanced themselves from her so they wouldn&#39;t be an 
embarrassment. They certainly didn&#39;t want their daughter off in Iraq, 
even if her life was generally misguided and without ambition. Vai was 
no fighter, though at times her violence came out like lava from a 
volcano. She attested her anger to cruel circumstance, and loneliness, 
and having a lack of love outside her home&#151;and sometimes even in it as 
well.
Day Five

Mihoshi Kagure, or Yuki to her friends, was a schizophrenic lost in 
another time, born into a system that seemed out of her own world, mad 
in a sense and in a way, clearly sane. She believed herself to be a 
samurai, and in fact addressed herself as Samurai Yuki whenever meeting 
somebody, unless someone else introduced her. On one level, she did 
indeed model herself after the likes of Zatoichi, Sonny Chiba, and the 
inimitable Toshiro Mifune, but on another level, the term &quot;samurai&quot; 
described her well.

In medieval Japan, samurai meant &quot;to serve&quot;, and anyone who knew Yuki 
well enough knew that this fit her personality. She was constantly 
looking to serve and help other people with their problems&#151;sometimes 
sticking her nose where it didn&#39;t belong, so her quixotic nature landed 
her in trouble a lot. She carried a large wooden stick with her whenever 
she could get away with it, saying one never knew when trouble arose. 
Half the time, though, her disposition caused the trouble rather than 
ending it.

On the fifth day of the march, Yuki traveled with some of the teachers, 
especially Miss Raulson, whose grasp on Japanese history was as 
impressive as her large gambling debts. Raulson was able to fill in 
blanks even Yuki didn&#39;t know, most notably saying how accurate (or 
inaccurate) many of the popular Eastern movies were. Obviously, Chinese 
Mandarin theater was all rot, and recent films seemed to concentrate 
more on flashy, impossible fighting moves more than realism. Kurosawa 
seemed to have a slightly better grip of his own country&#39;s history; Ran 
in particular was one of Yuki&#39;s favorite movies.

As Yuki became acquainted with Raulson, and the school in general, Dr. 
Andrews watched from afar with her medical kit close by. Not a single 
one of the students circled and marching around the school had actually 
went inside, so there was no reason for her to go as well. She remained 
where she was just in case, as a professional, waiting for the emergency 
that might or (hopefully) might not come. She had the company of Sarah 
Johansson, Janet Keys, and Elspeth Post, but Sarah would join the girls 
on the very last day and lead the musical procession.

&quot;Your foster daughter seems to have mastered this well,&quot; noted the 
doctor during the march. She handed Keys a thermos of coffee she had 
brought, and passed it all around until everyone got a cup. Keys drank 
deep, warming herself up before speaking.

&quot;She gets it from the heart. Has to. She didn&#39;t even know her father, 
and her biological mother was so hard on her. Joss has had a tough life, 
but she&#39;s strong. She&#39;s made the most of it. She&#39;s going to outdo all of 
us one day, just you watch. Erica and I can only be there for her, and 
act like a springboard when she&#39;s ready to fall.&quot;

&quot;Mm. Must be nice having people who love you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say that, honey,&quot; said Sarah, giving her a look. &quot;I love you 
plenty; we all do.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah?&quot; Andrews snorted and nearly drained her coffee. She added, 
&quot;Nobody was there for me when I fell. I had to pick myself up each time. 
You can&#39;t call a person strong if somebody else helps them.&quot;

&quot;Jean, that&#39;s a terrible thing to say.&quot;

&quot;Terrible and true.&quot; Sip. Empty. She filled it up and gave the rest of 
the coffee to Elspeth. &quot;So what about you? Thoughts, Miss Post? Remarks, 
regrets?&quot;

&quot;No. None at all.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot; asked Mrs. Keys. Post looked deep into her eyes, deep into 
the possibility she could never have, and nodded her head.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure.&quot; Sarah Jo finished her drink and gave Andrews a hug from 
behind.

&quot;Well, anyway, people are here for you now, doctor, so don&#39;t think 
otherwise for a moment.&quot; She kissed the older woman on the back of her 
head and left to get some spare jackets from her car. Being from Sweden, 
Sarah was used to the cold, but she knew the others weren&#39;t (Elspeth and 
Andrews were English by birth, so even they were a little immune).

&quot;So what&#39;s the deal with May and Janine?&quot; asked Olivia, getting 
Victoria&#39;s attention. Her smallish, redheaded friend turned around 
slightly and groaned.

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know. Those two are so weird. It&#39;s hard keeping track of 
them. Janine says she&#39;s straight, but sometimes I wonder. June, you know 
your sister the best. What do you think?&quot; June smiled, holding her flute 
since her wheelchair provided support for the banners and signs she had.

&quot;Every time Janine comes over to practice, they seem to dance around the 
kissing part. When they do kiss, they can barely stop, and every time 
she leaves, it&#39;s like something really awful happened to her, and May&#39;s 
a distant wreck. You know what I mean? We had a long talk last night, 
and she told me she might be thinking that it&#39;s a possibility that&#151;&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; said Vicki with a giggle, &quot;we get the idea. Your point?&quot;

&quot;My point,&quot; said June with a smile, &quot;is that I think my sister is 
suspicious of her own sexuality. I know it sounds clich&eacute; and silly, but 
she&#39;s had Janine on her mind for awhile. She doesn&#39;t have too many 
friends, least of all any she can identify with&#151;of course, I don&#39;t 
either&#151;so Janine&#39;s been a blessing. Like you said, I just wish they went 
one way or the other.&quot;

&quot;And so you accepted who you were and were okay with it,&quot; noted Olivia.

&quot;That&#39;s right, and I&#39;ve never been happier.&quot; She looked up and squeezed 
Vicki&#39;s hand; they managed to exchange a kiss in mid-march. She resumed 
after awhile with, &quot;My sister, on the other hand...... Honestly, I don&#39;t 
think she&#39;d be against a relationship with another girl. She needs 
someone to love, anyone, and I&#39;m more of a poor substitute now than I 
was before.&quot;

&quot;But you two have never been that close.&quot;

&quot;I know, I&#39;m just saying.&quot;

&quot;Well, we can count Janine out,&quot; sighed Olivia as she crossed her arms. 
&quot;May could be gay, pardon the bad rhyme, but Jean&#39;ll never cave in. 
She&#39;d sooner amputate a finger than sleep with a girl. That little 
locker room incident tore her up pretty bad, and she&#39;s awkward in any 
really sexual situation. She&#39;s just messed up.&quot;

&quot;No more than you or I,&quot; noted Victoria. Olivia agreed.

&quot;What&#39;cha guys talkin&#39; about?&quot; said Blake, suddenly barging in and 
putting her arms around her friends. Victoria squealed in surprise and 
Olivia shoved the poor girl off.

&quot;How your asinine Jewish nose always manages to stick itself into 
people&#39;s business!&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s Gab&#39;s work.&quot;

&quot;Then you forgot your meds.&quot; Blake made a face.

&quot;Damn, I did. I oughta give my girls a piece of my mind.&quot; She ran off 
looking for them, leaving the trio to themselves. June murmured.

&quot;Just make sure to keep enough to think with...&quot;
Day Six

Alexis Walker wished she hadn&#39;t slept with Alisha Fox. It just made her 
seem so desperate&#151;well, it did for both of them. At least she had some 
level of identification with Aintzane, celebrated Captain of the soccer 
team and all-around great girl. Zane had been just the medicine for her, 
wild and weird and way off the beaten track, and the sparks could&#39;ve 
flown further and longer if they hadn&#39;t given up out of sheer apathy. 
Sleeping together, even with a sexy soccer player&#151;hell, even with the 
Captain&#151;had gotten too mundane, too awkward. And she never had been a 
morning person.

Thankfully, Zane was not a bed-hopper; she didn&#39;t go from one sack to 
the next, experiencing one girl then immediately going for another, as 
if they were a buffet. That was a quality X liked, and maybe part of the 
reason why she still yearned for the taller woman, even as they stood on 
opposite sides of the ring and marched. Zane herself was off talking to 
some of her mates in soccer, or when she could afford it, the teachers, 
thus giving Walker some well-earned space. Of course, she just had to 
ruin it all by bedding Alisha Fox, a mistake they both felt the 
following day.

It could&#39;ve been worse, though. She could&#39;ve slept with Miss Jo, who was 
conveniently her type. But Miss Jo had tougher chicks to follow; X just 
had to follow Ayanna Montgomery and watch, with some nostalgia, as she 
clung to Hero. Ah, Hero. So similar to her, yet so different, in nearly 
every way. Love had went away with a nice girl, so why weren&#39;t there any 
sweethearts attached to Walker&#39;s arm? Didn&#39;t she, the big lug on campus, 
deserve someone as well?

Feeling socially suicidal, she wound her way through the crowd and 
searched for Alisha Fox. And Zane Klein.

Aintzane Rikke Klein said, &quot;I thought you two&#39;d get together sometime. 
It was only a matter of time.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re just walking, Zane.&quot;

&quot;And your arms are linked.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s cold, Miss Klein.&quot;

&quot;I saw you smiling at each other.&quot;

&quot;Emma can tell very good jokes.&quot;

&quot;And kiss.&quot;

&quot;So Janna&#39;s friendly, so what?&quot; Zane grinned.

&quot;You know that river in Egypt, de Amazon?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the Nile river,&quot; said Raulson. Zane made a face.

&quot;Huh? I thought it was the Amazon.&quot;

&quot;The Amazon&#39;s Brazilian, baka!&quot; shouted Yuki. Zane made another face.

&quot;And I have no idea what you just said.&quot; Yuki snorted, turned her back, 
and resumed talking to Miss Raulson. Zane put her arms on her head and 
tried prying deeper into McGowen&#39;s life, but all she got was a report on 
more collaborations the two teachers were doing. Working together, they 
reminded her, was not the same thing as sleeping together.

That night, Emma McGowen and Janna Raulson slept together. Go figure.</pre>
