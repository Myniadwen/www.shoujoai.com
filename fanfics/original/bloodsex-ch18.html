<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 18 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>The windows blew out of the office building in a burst
of flame, smoke spiraling up from the roof as the
dangerous contents burned away. The men and women who
had worked in there only a few minutes ago watched
dumfounded as the building burned away, silently
questioning how any of this could be possible.

Then she walked out from the fire, and they knew.

Jess Drake wore her long black jacket and matching
gloves, dark sunglasses shading her eyes as she walked
over to the manager. The man was nearly quaking with
fear as the black haired woman snagged him by the
collar to stop him from running away. &quot;Do you know why
I&#39;m here?&quot; she asked him with a deadly sort of calm.

&quot;No,&quot; he got out, but the panic in his eyes told the
tale.

&quot;I know about your little drug operation here,&quot; Jess
said coldly, tossing him to the ground and watching
him cower there at her feet. &quot;I&#39;m going to assume
you&#39;re new here,&quot; she said, &quot;and didn&#39;t know the
rules.&quot; Her voice was ice cold, &quot;This territory is
under my protection, and not you, the Lady or anyone
else gets to operate here.&quot;

Blam! Blam! Blam! From the side bullets rang out,
punching into the leather coat that Jess wore, jerking
the young woman around. Then shockingly the bullets
dropped to the ground, stopped cold by the leather
even as Jess turned to him, eyes glowing faintly blue.

&quot;St.. st.. stay back,&quot; he managed to get out past his
fear, raising his gun again but before he could fire
Jess was on the move.

&quot;How dare you!&quot; there was rage in Jess&#39; voice as she
slapped the gun out of his hand, grabbing him by the
tie. Her hand clamped on his face as she began to
chant, harsh, grating words that seemed to tear at the
air around them.

&quot;AEIIII!&quot;

Smoke curled around her fingers as she let the
screaming gunman go, watching him claw at his now
badly scarred face. Jess looked at the shocked
figures, studying them as if wanting to be sure she
had actually made her point, then she nodded. &quot;You
might want to take him to a hospital,&quot; she said as she
turned to walk away.

&quot;Who....&quot; the manager trailed off.

&quot;Drake,&quot; Jess answered softly, &quot;spread the word
around.&quot;

None of it had made it into the papers, of course, the
all important secrecy was always maintained about the
supernatural, but the local rumor mill was another
story. It didn&#39;t take long for the story to spread in
the community, and even less time for a certain person
to hear about it and head down to the tattoo parlor.

Hunter pushed the front door to the business open,
smiling wryly as she listened to the cheery sound of
the bell even as she looked around her warily. &quot;Is it
safe to come in?&quot; the lanky blonde called out, her
buzz-cut and clothing making her look even more butch
than she normally did. Her jeans and t-shirt helped
her radiate a healthy sensuality, and that along with
her succubus nature made her nearly irresistible.

&quot;Depends,&quot; Jess emerged from the back room and gave
Hunter a deliberately blank look, &quot;are you getting me
in more trouble?&quot;

Hunter fought to conceal a wince. She had brought
Alice over to the Daughters of Artemis in the honest
hope of helping her and Jess make up, but instead she
had just made things worse. Elizabeth, Jess&#39; other
lover, had been coming on to her at the time, and
Alice had, understandably, been shocked. Shocked, and
ultimately furious.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jess softened her tone, &quot;that was low.&quot;

&quot;Hell,&quot; Hunter conceded, &quot;I should have at least
called ahead to see if Elizabeth was there, I know she
likes the Daughters.&quot;

&quot;And maybe I should have been telling Elizabeth to
keep her hands to herself,&quot; Jess shrugged
uncomfortable. Changing the subject she asked, &quot;What&#39;s
up?&quot;

&#39;Doesn&#39;t want to talk about it,&#39; Hunter noted
worriedly. &quot;I heard about last night,&quot; she noted,
&quot;that was pretty hard-core.&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; Jess raised an eyebrow.

Hunter smiled grimly, &quot;Think you might be
overcompensating a little?&quot;

Jess hesitated a moment then met Hunter&#39;s eyes. &quot;I
took on a responsibility when I kicked the Lady&#39;s
people out of this area,&quot; she said, &quot;an&#39; I&#39;ve been
letting that slip for a while.&quot;

&quot;So know you&#39;re becoming Batman?&quot; Hunter said
mockingly.

&quot;No,&quot; Jess answered tersely, &quot;but scaring the shit out
of dealers and that ilk works.&quot;

Hunter had to concede that point, at least. &quot;Going out
again regularly?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I doubt I&#39;ll need to,&quot; Jess shrugged, &quot;last night
should scare the shit out of anyone who was thinking
of setting up shop here.&quot; She looked down at the
counter she leaned on and finally asked, &quot;How&#39;s Alice
been doing?&quot;

&quot;Somewhere in between pissed off and depressed,&quot;
Hunter answered promptly. She was about to say more
when the doorbell ringed, a figure striding inside.

Clearly a young woman she oddly had almost silvery
hair, her face quite delicately featured. Carrying
herself with grace she walked inside, her short skirt
tight against long legs, stockings faintly hissing
together. Ignoring Hunter she went right to Jess,
setting a purse down on the counter. &quot;Are you the
proprietor?&quot; she asked with a smoky voice.

&quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Jess answered even as she gave Hunter a
look and the other woman left reluctantly, studying
the lady with hungry eyes.

&#39;Wonder if she&#39;s more trouble?&#39; Hunter mused as she
walked away, part of her wishing she was back in the
tattoo parlor with the mystery lady. Then she shook
her head and walked on, deciding it was none of her
business.

Back in the shop the young lady studied Jess with her
green eyes before nodding slightly. &quot;My name is Sara,&quot;
she said, &quot;and I have a commission for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Jess looked at her curiously. &#39;A commission,&#39;
she silently mused, &#39;that&#39;s an interesting choice of
words.&#39;

Sara smoothly removed her coat, revealing the top of
the strapless blue dress she wore as well as the scar
that marked her neck. &quot;I want you to incorporate the
scar into a tattoo for me,&quot; she explained softly, the
red mark bold on pale skin.

Jess reached out to cautiously touch the healed wound,
tracing it up and down. &quot;How did you get it?&quot; she
asked eve as she began to think of possible designs.

&quot;Does it matter?&quot; Sara asked, shuddering faintly as
Jess touched her.

Seeing her reaction Jess drew her hand back as she
though, &#39;If she&#39;s that sensitive to touch, her getting
tattooed is going to be much worse than normal.&#39; Aloud
she remarked, &quot;I&#39;d rather not choose a design that
reminds you of how you were hurt.&quot;

&quot;I was bit,&quot; Sara conceded, &quot;by a man I was dating.&quot;

&quot;A vampire,&quot; Jess noted as she went to grab a sketch
pad, a pencil soon flying over the page as she put
thoughts to paper.

&quot;So the stories are true, you do believe in this sort
of thing,&quot; Sara remarked. She sighed softly,. &quot;The
police didn&#39;t believe me entirely, but they arrested
him for assault.&quot;

&quot;Then daylight came and he was in the cell,&quot; Jess
nodded knowingly.

&quot;He burst into flame,&quot; Sara sounded almost glad, &quot;it
consumed him in seconds.&quot; She smiled grimly, &quot;The
police never even tried to explain away that.&quot;

&quot;So how did you hear about me?&quot; Jess asked as she
carefully took a brush to splash color onto one of her
sketches.

&quot;The coroner Dr. Delafield mentioned you,&quot; Sara said
as she watched Jess create a image so vividly, &quot;she
said you had some experience with this.&quot;

&quot;Occasionally,&quot; Jess agreed. She held out the sketch,
the image of some dark goddess standing ready for
battle, the scar forming part of her shape, &quot;What do
you think?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s lovely,&quot; Sara breathed.

Gently Jess took her hand and drew her towards the
back room, &quot;Then let&#39;s get to work.&quot;</pre>
