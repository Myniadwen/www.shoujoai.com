<p>VOLUME THREE: THE DEAD ROSE</p>
<p>“Shivering Timbers: the pirate  queen!”</p>
<p>Waking  up from a smoky  unconsciousness was probably the worst thing that had ever happened  to Captain Zola Iminstileil, and that was counting the time she had  to sacrifice her own child in order to save her crew from a ravenous  black hole (long story). She thought she knew what true nightmares  were, and that nothing in this world or any number of worlds—or  even anything from the bowels of Hell itself—could prove her wrong.  When she opened her eyes and felt clarity bestowed upon her, however,  she knew her perspective was being rewritten before her very eyes.  Those pirates didn’t simply kill her crew and ransack the place, oh  no. They maimed the bodies, ripped the skin off, flung the blood  everywhere, threw the wet bones in a pile, and laughed about it while  sharing the spoils—both material and corporeal.</p>
<p>She could close her eyes and shut  her mouth to silence her bellowing screams, but she could still smell  the rancid smoke, the putrid stink of blood, the rot of massacred  bodies, and the scorching of flesh as the few survivors were jabbed  with white-hot irons. <em>Oh god,</em> she thought to herself, <em>they’re  BRANDING my crew! It’s like we’re nothing more than cattle to  them!</em> Admittedly, the pirates spared most of the women and  didn’t harm anyone younger than sixteen, but that didn’t excuse  this appalling depravity. She felt like she was spiraling down,  dizzy with revulsion, more content to slip into unconsciousness than  stay awake to witness this. But the overpowering stench of defeat  and destruction kept her awake, and her eyes were forced open just  long enough to glare at her hated foe.</p>
<p>“God will never forgive you for  this!” she snarled. The pirate captain just smiled wolfishly and  wrapped her fingers around Zola’s chin—but was she cupping it  affectionately or getting ready to crush her throat? With this one,  it was hard to tell.</p>
<p>“Don’t act so pious, Captain  Daddy’s Girl. You deserve no better.” Zola clamped her teeth  down on the woman’s hand as hard as she could, and was slapped  sharply for her efforts.</p>
<p>“You dare to compare us after <em>this?!</em>” she cried. “What you’re doing would put devils  to shame!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Hell yeah,” the other woman  chuckled. “That’s the business we’re in. But be a dear and  jog my memory for me. Didn’t your crew attack <em>innocent</em> people a few times? You burned, you sacked, you raped, the whole  shebang. You gave pirates a pretty good reputation…except that you  weren’t <em>really</em> pirates, were you?”</p>
<p>“Be quiet!!”</p>
<p>“All in the name of your King and  Queen, eh?” she grinned. Zola sprang to her feet and grabbed the  nearest weapon she could find; the glass shard cut into her palm, but  pain was now the least of her worries.</p>
<p>“We were at war, and they were  our enemies. God forgave us because what we did was righteous! They  were a country of pagans! When you get to Hell, the devils will  throw you into the deepest, darkest pit, where you’ll writhe in  agony for eternity! We waged a holy war! How <em>dare</em> you  suggest you’re better than us!”</p>
<p>“Did you write that speech  yourself?” the captain grinned, never once missing a beat. Zola  couldn’t take it anymore; she rushed right at the devilish woman,  thrusting her shard as deep as she could. It sunk into the woman’s  chest, but all she did was flash her wicked teeth, pull Zola close,  and give her a farewell kiss. Her long cutlass plunged straight  through Zola’s flesh and slashed downwards, splitting her like a  banana peel. The pirate captain then sighed, wiped her mouth and  sword, and faced her crew.</p>
<p>“Waste of a good corset.” She  unbuttoned her coat and flung off the shredded piece of thick  clothing, briefly exposing her breasts. The crew laughed and  cheered, and threw piles of dead, withered roses—their trademark  calling card. “All right, move out, lasses! Tag the rest of the  prisoners and cart in the loot! We’ll set this maggot-ridden  dinghy adrift to warn the other Royal slags! And may their holy  warmongering god have mercy on their souls!” The crew laughed and  cheered louder than before as they led their naked hostages into the  ship. The Dead Rose, Captain of the <em>Bloody Dove</em> and leader of  an all-woman pirate gang, was the last to board her ship and  mockingly saluted the <em>Majestic Hand</em> as she sailed away. Revenge was so sweet.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Meanwhile, nearly half a galaxy  away, Keiko Ozmund had finally arrived at her destination, the  headquarters of the United Cosmic Military, and was scheduled to  speak with the Director concerning a certain rise in piracy around  the less civilized pockets of space. Her brother Kyle was really  more suited </p>
<p>for these kinds of confrontations  than she was: he was the heart and soul of the Ozmund Company; he  could command the love and respect of the people. Keiko was clearly  the brain of the operation, but she could barely command a dog, and  was shy around those she was unfamiliar with. Because of her amazing  brilliance, she was ostracized by the general public and had very few  friends, and only volunteered to see the Director because she felt a  sort of kinship with the older woman. Besides, if Kyle had come in  her place, she would have to care for the Company, and that would be  disastrous.</p>
<p>The  United Cosmic military had been  around since before the last Ice Age, according to Gaia’s  chronology. It was thousands of years old and immensely powerful,  combining police forces and armies from countless worlds. The Helios  system was still a relative newcomer, just barely thirty years as a  member, yet it wielded significant influence, especially considering  the Director originated from that system. Keiko had never met her in  person, but she heard plenty of rumors, and most of it was praise. The  woman was relatively young and considered a genius, even among  the elite, and she even had a family history of military service and  space exploration. Keiko figured she’d be able to hold her own  with a celebrity like that and believed they could reason together—so  naturally, she was very disappointed when an aide came in to tell her  that the Director would be unable to make it.</p>
<p>“She sends her deepest apologies  and assumes responsibility for any inconvenience, but she’s  currently on vacation, and…not to be rude or anything, but it was  long overdue. The Director has promised me personally that she will  return in a week or less, but in the meantime, you’ve been given an  audience with a member of our board of trustees. He’s not <em>officially</em> a part of the UCM, but he does have quite a bit of  clout around here. In a lot of ways, he’s just as good as the  Director. Uh, should I send him in?”</p>
<p>“Well, if he’s been waiting for  me, I see no point in wasting his time.” The aide hurried over to  the doorway and opened it; Keiko jumped to her feet and felt her  blood run cold as she saw him enter the room. There are some people  in this life who simply exude a magnificent, intimidating presence  even when they’re relaxed; Lord Maoska Demise was one of those  people, an exceptional, powerful man with a stern face and very sharp  eyes. Keiko recognized him instantly and stood at attention, feeling  somewhat afraid. The Ozmund Company was a big name in the transport  business, but when it came to technological power, Demise Industries  had no rival.</p>
<p>“Sir, I… Forgive me for taking  so much of your valuable time!” she stammered. “I had  thought…well…I mean…uh…excuse me for babbling!”</p>
<p>“Calm down,” he spoke firmly,  “and take a seat. If you’re not relaxed, this meeting will bode  poorly for us both. You there, could you bring us some tea? I don’t  really care how mine is prepared; what’s your fancy, Miss Ozmund?”</p>
<p>“Um…just chamomile will do, if  you don’t mind.” The aide vanished silently, leaving Keiko to  turn red from humiliation. So much for feeling like she could handle  the situation! “S-sir,” she whispered, “I mean, my lord, I  presume you know why I’ve come and what my request is about. Please forgive me for acting like a frightened little mouse. I’m  not very good at…interactions.”</p>
<p>“Well, we must all have at least  one shortcoming,” he gestured numbly. “I’ve never been good at  music myself. Yes, I’ve been informed of your purpose. It’s  unfortunate the Director could not be here, but she does work rather  hard, I must admit. I’ve never particularly liked the people who  run this vast organization, so it’s taken me some time to warm up  to this one. She seems competent enough—but anyway, now I am  babbling.” Keiko blushed even deeper, but the appearance of the  tea saved her. She slowly regained her composure and even relaxed  her shoulders. Lord Demise was almost kingly in his demeanor and  appearance; all he lacked was a beard and a crown. He had graceful,  fluid manners and was both handsome and mild, though he looked strong  enough to wrestle a bear.</p>
<p>“There are numerous pirate  factions out in those wild regions you’re planning on expanding  into,” he stated after taking a few quiet sips. “Some, let’s  be honest, are much less harmless than others. Since my influence  has not reached into those areas yet, I cannot perfectly understand  your situation, but I believe I have a good grasp of things. So  you’re considering signing a contract with an outside source that  promises protection in return for profits. I presume you’ve either  looked into this offer more carefully, or else you’re in the  process, and you’ve decided to seek an alternative in case you  don’t find something you like. Pirates are a tiny fraction of the  problem besetting us all, Miss Ozmund, and as important as your  business is—to us all—there is simply no feasible way for the  military, or even my people, to intervene. Let me explain.</p>
<p>“Business keeps everything  spinning and going, to put it simply. We exchange, trade, bargain,  that sort of thing. My company creates things, and your company  transports those things and their merchants all over. If I may speak  as the UCM’s advocate, security for <em>your</em> company would only  be in demand for those areas of the greatest…well, I don’t wish  to say the greatest profit, but you do understand where I’m coming  from, don’t you? Exploration is one thing, but suggesting that you  open a major line where there is no <em>need</em> of one is rather a  waste. Let’s say the pirates attack us around Strategos, and the  police put a stop to them. All well and good, and everyone on the  right side of the fence is happy. You’ve earned more than you  spent, I should think. Now let’s say they attack just outside…hmm,  Kelthos Prime. Oh, I am not </p>
<p>referring to any <em>specific,  precedented</em> attack, Miss Ozmund; I am simply being hypothetical. Let’s say our police stop them again and everything is all right,  but since hardly anything lives out there these days, it wouldn’t  make sense to spend all that money just to ferry supplies for a few  thousand people.</p>
<p>“Please don’t give me that  look, Miss Ozmund. I daresay I’ve been at this longer than you  have, and I know that sometimes we businesspeople make cruel  decisions. But think about it rationally for a moment, and I’m  sure you’ll agree. I’m not against exploration—and if you do  explore, I’m sure there are hundreds of thousands of mercenaries  you could hire for protection. I’m just saying that as long as  there’s no centralized form of economy, or any significant apex of  industry in the area, the UCM cannot help yet. I say ‘yet’  because naturally, people <em>will</em> congregate there in time, and  perhaps our duties will lighten in the future, and we can send  further aid. My recommendation for the present is as follows, and  keep in mind this is a suggestion only. You can wait for the  Director and negotiate with her, or else you can hire this unknown  company and…hope for the best, or you can go out on your own  and…handle the issue personally. There are pirates out there who  are willing to kill other pirates, and most of them work cheap. Please excuse me,” he said in a low voice as he glanced at his  watch, “but I have another appointment coming up, and I do not wish  to treat them any differently than I treated you. Farewell, Miss  Ozmund, and may you find good fortune.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your time.” She  finished the tea and took a deep, cleansing breath. She waited until  he had left before muttering under her breath, “No help at all. Figures.”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>“Looks like there’s nothing  left,” Teleah sighed as the <em>Dauntless</em> drew closer to the  derelict ship. “I’m not picking up any signs of life. How long  do you think it’s been drifting?”</p>
<p>“Not long,” her sister  answered. “Those blast marks look fresh, and there’s still some  debris flying out. We must’ve just missed the raid.”</p>
<p>“Vimmy did mention an increase in  pirate activity around this area,” Teleah mused. “Do you think  we should explore it?”</p>
<p>“But if you can’t find any  life…and if it was hit by pirates…”</p>
<p>“But who, and how long ago? Ah,  come here and take a look.” The twins stepped aside as Miracle  peered out the monitor. They only recently came across this dead  vessel, and since it was on their way to Saigrim, a sight like this  would draw concern.</p>
<p>“The <em>Majestic Hand</em>? I’ll  have Herut and Shana look into it and see where it came from. Perhaps it was ferrying the Nail of Saigrim, or perhaps whoever  attacked it tried to interrogate the crew about its location. We are  almost there, so…”</p>
<p>“Do you think we have another  rival?” Amy rubbed her chin thoughtfully, although she really had  no serious doubt.</p>
<p>“We’ll find out once the girls  ascertain its location and cargo. Are there any survivors?” The  twins shook their heads and Miracle quietly dismissed herself, though  she seemed awfully concerned. The Nail of Saigrim had a lot of  historical and sentimental value, but wouldn’t fetch anybody riches  or fame. Naja would be disappointed if she learned it had been taken  by pirates, but other than that…</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So what did they say?” called  a voice, jarring Miracle’s thoughts away. She looked over and  noticed the impatient Elshyrin glaring, arms crossed and eyes aflame. Miracle paled and attempted to smile.</p>
<p>“Well, the ship’s name is the <em>Majestic Hand</em>. The twins think it was attacked by pirates,  and we probably have a new rival on our hands…”</p>
<p>“Pirates?!”  Naja screeched out  loud and roared with laughter, slapping her scaly leg several times.  “Serves those Saigrim bastards right! Pirates! Sss-hahahahaha!! I hope  they got chopped up and squished into goo! Oh, you don’t  know what I’m laughing about, do you?” She wiped a tear of joy  from her eye and loosened up; few people had ever seen Naja in such a  good mood. “Well, long story short, Jelrin has a long-standing  allegiance with Saigrim, and sometimes some of the dowdier members of  my race are arranged to marry their asshole nobles. It’s a  Kingdom, you know. Anyhoo, when I was exiled from my home world, my  fiancé arranged for a ship called the <em>Majestic Hand</em> to keep  an eye on me, if they could. I thought I had lost them awhile ago,  but…they just now…oh gods, it’s too funny! They were blown to  tiny little pieces! Sss-aaahhahahaha!!” She roared even louder  and almost fell down; Miracle didn’t quite know what to say.</p>
<p>“Uh, your…fiancé? I never  knew you were getting married.”</p>
<p>“<em>Forced</em> to get married,”  Naja corrected as she stood up. She sighed and shook all the giggles  from her system. “Almost all the couples on Jelrin are decided by  arranged marriage. It’s all about power, politics, economy,  growth, that sort of shit. I come from a pretty hot family myself,  so I was big shit back home. Anyway, my folks wanted to hook me up  with this anachronistic asshole—I mean, he wasn’t evil or  anything, he just wanted to keep me chained up at home, carrying  around his brood like some animal. A few bimbos go for that, but I  wanted nothing to do with it, so I sort of…caused a scene. Well, I  made myself repulsive in the worst possible way, and here I am. I  told you I didn’t want to leave this ship, right? That’s the  reason why.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t really a long  story short,” Miracle muttered. Naja cringed venomously but  decided to let the remark slide. She hadn’t meant to come off as  chatty; her anger simply overpowered her restraint.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  well, now ya know. I  really don’t like it here, but it’s the lesser of two evils. Anyway, if  you can find a way to keep me outta that marriage, I’d…you  know…I’d appreciate it. You <em>are</em> Dr. Miracle, after all.” Amy laughed melodiously and waved her hand dismissively. People  always got the wrong impression about that name of hers!</p>
<p>“I assure you, the name is just a  coincidence. It actually started out as a Latin word—<em>Mirari</em>,  I think. My ancestors were astrologers and so the name makes sense,  even though they never had any real powers. My family had it changed  in the mid-19th century and it’s pretty much stayed the  same for six centuries. All I can do is analyze literature and go  over the finer points of religion.”</p>
<p>“Well, even so,” Naja shrugged  as she walked away helplessly, “small help is better than no help  at all. I’m gonna go have another laugh—but maybe we should  chase those pirates down.”</p>
<p>“All this fuss over a trinket?” The Acheron sisters stepped out of the cockpit, rubbing their hands  on a washcloth, all four eyes leveled at Naja. “For someone so  unenthusiastic about this expedition, you sure can be obsessive.”</p>
<p>“I was figuring that caveman  fiancé of mine would bargain with it,” she answered, casually  resting her hands on her head. “The Nail of Saigrim’s pretty big  shit on Jelrin. He </p>
<p>might just call of the whole damn  wedding if I gave it to him. It’s worth more than my sorry ass  right now.” The sisters sighed wearily, exchanged a look of  caution, and glanced over at Miracle.</p>
<p>“What do you suggest? Naja’s  impulsiveness may very well kill somebody.”</p>
<p>“But  she did ask for us to find  it,” Miracle replied softly. “If we turn down her request, it  would be like turning down your dreams as well. If you can live with  that, we’ll find another destination.” Amy might have been a  mousy, soft-spoken, unassuming woman (with a limp, no less), but her  eyes glimmered with unfathomable strength and conviction; it was as  if she was Naja herself, pleading her case with an Elshyrin passion.  Naja never expected anybody to stand up for her like that, least of  all this humble woman, but she was glad for it and gained a new  respect for Amy. Of course, she became <em>much</em> happier when Kay  and Tee reluctantly returned to the cockpit and set a new course.</p>
<p>“She’ll owe us for this,” Kay  mumbled.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah,” Tee grunted—“big  time!”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Aseria and Lillianne were in bed  together when they heard the news. Feeling tired of playing the coy,  unresponsive maiden, Aseria had decided to be proactive and launched  herself at Lillianne right as she was undressing. The spontaneity  and aggressiveness of her actions caught the other woman by surprise,  so much so that she decided, just this one time, to hand over all  control to the sensual dark elf. Although their exhilarating sexual  escapade had thankfully not been interrupted, they had just settled  down and were cooing to each other softly when somebody burst through  their door.</p>
<p>“Hey! Guess what! We found some  pirates and they stole a treasure and we’re going after them and  you’re VERY naked, aren’t you? Hey, what happened? Did one of  Valti’s creatures spew a corrosive that eats away at people’s  clothes? Oh no, what if Chandra gets it? What if she uses it on me? What if she DOESN’T?”</p>
<p>WHOOM!! Poor Kyrie was thrust out  of the room faster than you can say “awkward”.</p>
<p>“Oww…how rude! It’s not as  if I asked to join them…but hey, maybe I should’ve.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, Kyrie! And shut the  door!”</p>
<p>“B-b-but the pirates!”</p>
<p>“FUCK THE PIRATES!!” they  screamed. Aseria chanted a spell to shut the door, leaving Kyrie  bewildered and alone in the hallway. An idea struck her just then  and her mouth stretched out into a beautiful crimson smile.</p>
<p>“Ya know, that’s not a bad idea  either!” She bounced off gaily, singing and laughing to herself as  some rather kinky ideas started going through that twisted mind of  hers.</p>
<p>A few women onboard were familiar  with the various pirate gangs that terrorized the wild frontiers of  the galaxy: the Sharks, the Devil Hunters, the Green Eagles, the  Misfortunes, the Crisis Bringers, the Deep Shadows, the Ruins, and  the Black Diamonds, just to name a few. As the <em>Dauntless</em> sailed beyond the ruined <em>Majestic Hand</em>, the Acheron sisters  took telescopic </p>
<p>photos, and identified several  small, withered roses in the debris. Yenae, who was best acquainted  with both sides of the law, crossed her arms defensively and frowned.</p>
<p>“The Dead Roses,” she sighed.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, I’ve heard of them,”  Valti said. “They throw dead roses onto any ship they attack, and  their leader supposedly kisses her victims before running them  through. I forgot what her ship’s name is, though.”</p>
<p>“It’s the <em>Bloody Dove</em>,”  Yenae answered solemnly. She was now so far removed from her usual  perky self that some people were showing concern, including Alala. She  had never seen the horned prankster acting so serious, and  wondered what sort of ploy she was brewing up. Yenae sighed and  shook her head slowly. “Considering the condition of that  wreckage, they can’t be very far ahead. We’ll probably catch  up.”</p>
<p>“You sound worried,” Valti  observed.</p>
<p>“I can’t be confident with  every encounter. So why are we after them again?”</p>
<p>“They stole a treasure I wanted  for myself!” Naja hissed sharply. “That’s reason enough to  send an armada after them!”</p>
<p>“That’s reason enough to lock  you up,” Yenae muttered. Alala laughed loudest as Naja shrieked  and cursed; she met Yenae’s eyes and was paralyzed for a moment as  her tormentor’s gaze burned into her brain.</p>
<p>“H-hey, come on, you gonna wimp  out on us just cuz’ we’re chasing some flowery pirates?” Yenae’s tension loosened and she smiled with love once more. She  had entertained several doubts, but hearing encouragement from the  woman she cherished the most made her feel like everything was going  to be fine.</p>
<p>“Of course not! You know me  better than that, buttercup.” Alala naturally fumed and swiped at  the air as Yenae went into action. “All right, ladies, prepare for  an attack! And Naja, if you want that piece of junk, you’re gonna  have to work like hell to earn it!”</p>
<p>“Are you giving me an order?”  she snarled. Yenae shot her a deadly look that made the proud  Elshyrin respect her very suddenly. “Oh, uh, yes, I see your  point. Right! Just don’t you hold me back when I get going!”</p>
<p>“Captain, ship approaching fast  off the portside stern! Independent class, registered out of Helios  9! It’s marked as the <em>Dauntless</em>!”</p>
<p>“Never heard of it,” Captain  Rose muttered. “Call in and tell her what she’s up against, not  that there’s really a point. T’wouldn’t be an accident for a  ship to chase us like that!”</p>
<p>“Sending transmission. …Uh,  Captain? They’ve responded: ‘Surrender the Nail of Saigrim and  you’ll be spared. Our thanks for scrapping the <em>Hand</em>.’”</p>
<p>“Friend or foe?” Rose grinned. “Veer to portside and open up our irons. Tell em’ we ain’t got  the Nail and blow em’ a few hot kisses—that’ll send those  Plutonian pussies scampering.”</p>
<p>“Aye, ma’am.” The crew held  on tight as the <em>Bloody Dove</em> turned around, aiming its  impressive salvo straight at the approaching ship. Once the second  message was sent out, a handful of cannons spewed their payload,  scorching the rival ship lightly. The Dead Rose could be merciful if  she felt like it, but she was a ghastly enemy and few people ever  survived to challenge her twice. The <em>Dauntless</em> resumed its  course, though, gaining very quickly now that the <em>Dove</em> had  slowed down.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Another message!” cried the  communications officer. “It says, ‘by the honor of the Elshyrin  race, I accept your challenge. Prepare for battle! A pity we  couldn’t be friends; I owe you a debt for destroying the <em>Hand</em>. May the best woman win!’”</p>
<p>“Perhaps our kisses were a little  too passionate!” Rose laughed. “I never thought I’d meet a  proud Elshyrin in an independent ship, but what the hell? It’s a  big galaxy. Right—tell Peggy to let loose and cripple the mindless  snake! We’ll board her once she’s beached and get right down to  business!” The officer phoned the ammunitions supervisor and  relayed the message; she then gave her Captain a weary expression.</p>
<p>“Ma’am, she keeps insisting her  name isn’t Peggy. She wonders why you keep calling her that. Personally, I think you’re both brats.”</p>
<p>“No sex for you this week,  Duchess,” Rose muttered playfully. “Tell her I’ll make it up  to her if she opens the god-damned broadsides! They’re gaining!”</p>
<p>“Aye,” Duchess sighed. A moment  after the message was relayed, the <em>Bloody Dove’s</em> artillery  burst with explosives; the shots sailed through space and slapped the  approaching <em>Dauntless</em> soundly. A second and third salvo was  unleashed, but except for a few delays and a brief moment of  discombobulating, their rivals continued to live up to their name. Rose  cursed, but not because the other ship was gaining so rapidly.</p>
<p>“Damn. Why don’t they fight  back? Are they gonna ram us? Torch, you got anything on this ship?”</p>
<p>“No ma’am, not yet. Oh, wait,  get this: I think the owner is Dr. Miracle.” Rose’s face turned  ashen as she raised her eyebrow and took a deep breath. Even she had  heard that name before, in her younger days, when space was wilder  and freer and more dangerous. Although she didn’t have many facts,  Rose heard plenty of rumors, and if even a handful of them were true…</p>
<p>“By the devil’s hooves,” she  muttered. “Ha! So now I’m locking horns with the legendary  Miracle, am I? All right, ladies, time to show your worth! If they  be meaning to ram us, I say let’s divert their course and have them  ram something else! Patches, make a sharp forty-five degree angle on  the ventral side when the <em>Dauntless</em> is a hundred K away! Torch, before she changes course, release a  ballast and take us away! Tell Peggy to—pardon me, ladies, tell <em>our dear Henrietta</em> to  open fire on her belly once the smoke clears! That ought to show  this Miracle person just who he’s up against. With a will!”</p>
<p>“Aye, ma’am!” The <em>Bloody  Dove</em> fired a few rounds more to distract their rivals, then the  ship lurched downwards—that is, going beneath the <em>Dauntless</em>—and  opened the ballast, which hurled explosives into space. As expected,  the other ship couldn’t veer off course in time, but they nearly  broke every law of physics trying, and Rose had to give credit to the  pilot.</p>
<p>“Damn,  what a waste!” she  exclaimed as the bombs went off (and Henrietta fired the cannons). “I  hate blasting good ships like that. I hope that pilot made it,  whoever they are. I’ve not seen the like in many a year! All  right, ladies, time to turn this vessel around and come up on their  starboard side! You know the drill: loot treasure, kidnap the  pretty women, kill those who resist, the whole show. I’ve got dibs  on the pilot, though! Damn, but if they’re as good in bed as they  are…HOLY WHALES OF NEPTUNE, she’s headed straight for us!!”</p>
<p>The <em>Dauntless</em>, protected by  its Orihalcum alloy armor and guided by the skills of the Acheron  sisters, had turned its destruction into an attack, and had actually  plowed through explosives and shots to meet the <em>Bloody Dove</em>. It looked like a giant slab of metal and machinery come soaring down  to crush them all; the crew frantically tried to lean out of the way,  and nearly depleted their ammunition defending themselves (and in a  pinch, a cannon can alter the course of </p>
<p>a vehicle in space). But the <em>Bloody  Dove</em> was on the wrong side, and it required time to move out of  the way. The best Rose could hope for would be to steer enough to  port or starboard (Patches was making for starboard) to allow a berth  between the two ships, so that they would not be smashed when the two  collided. If only Rose knew just how frantic everyone was aboard the  rival ship, she might not have sweated bullets herself.</p>
<p>“Gracious!” Vimmy groaned as she  was tossed asunder. “Those blasted Acheron sisters are…WHOOAA…ugh,  they’re going to hear about this when I…WAAAHH…there’s bloody  nothing to hold onto, now I know what my clothes feel like when they  go through the drier…AAAHH, I’d give up a fraction of my portion  for a restraint—or a cushion, oh, my fragile…YAAAH…my fragile  body—urp!”</p>
<p>Rose wanted to be macho and not  flinch, but she couldn’t help squeezing her eyes shut as the <em>Dauntless</em> narrowly missed her beloved <em>Bloody Dove</em>. The  space between them was so narrow that the two ships seemed to tremble  in fear as the friction shook them. She was forced to pause for a  moment and catch her breath; her heart was jumping and her skin felt  cold and prickly. She gasped and called her communications officer.</p>
<p>“Duchess, status report!”</p>
<p>“We’re not damaged, Captain, but  we’re down to auxiliary ammo. Currently the <em>Dauntless</em> is  turning around and making for another attack. The damage to their  vessel seems to be minimal.”</p>
<p>“I’ve confirmed it,” Torch  added. “It’s just scorched and dented, ma’am. That’s some  serious shit they got plating that sucker. Permission to release  another ballast?”</p>
<p>“I ain’t trying a stunt like  that again,” Rose huffed. “If we could just board them, we’d  have em’ by the throat, but they didn’t even slow down when they  were ramming us. Those are some seriously insane people there, and  if they wanna be friends, maybe we should play things cool.”</p>
<p>“Are you giving up, Captain?”  Duchess said. Rose cast her a roguish look and waved her finger.</p>
<p>“I ain’t dead yet, am I? The  Dead Rose can do far worse damage to her enemies in person. Besides,  I’d like get on this Miracle guy’s good side. Tell em’ they’ve  won and we’re ready to be friends.”</p>
<p>“That Elshyrin’s going to bitch  about the Nail of Saigrim, you know,” Patches called out as Duchess  sent the transmission.</p>
<p>“So let the bitch bitch. We don’t  have it. The <em>Hand</em> sure as hell didn’t have it, unless one  of you screwed up.”</p>
<p>“No, we searched carefully. What  would we do with it anyway?”</p>
<p>“Good point. Well, raise the  white flag, ladies, and pray to Sappho that there’s at least one  pretty woman onboard.” When both transmissions were sent, a live  video feed opened up, and Rose got her first look at the pilot, the  Elshyrin, and the entity she assumed to be Dr. Miracle.</p>
<p>“So you have decided to cast aside  your pride and admit defeat. It truly would have been a waste to  continue this meaningless—OUCH!”</p>
<p>“Fuck off, Rachel, <em>I’m</em> talking to them! So what in the hell do you mean when you say you  don’t have the Nail?!”</p>
<p>“I meant what I said,” Rose  replied, feeling bewildered. So was Miracle’s first name Rachel? She smelled a ruse. “We don’t have it. We stripped the <em>Majestic  Hand</em> bare and only </p>
<p>found the usual swag. Hell, if you  really wanted it that badly, we would’ve given it to you by now. We ain’t got no use for something like that.”</p>
<p>“I’m disinclined to believe  you!” Naja screamed. Rose shrugged casually.</p>
<p>“Believe what you will. Anyway, I  admire your spunk, and you look pretty hot for a snake. Where’s  your pilot?” Kayleigh and Teleah revealed themselves wordlessly,  expecting a shocked reaction. Obviously they had no idea who they  were addressing! “My-my,” Rose purred, “how lovely. You  really kick ass, ladies. I wonder if I could seduce you away from  Miracle and enlist you here. I guarantee you’ll be in the best of  company, and we’ll treat you like queens.” Her crew cheered and  whistled proudly, underscoring Rose’s promises. The Acheron  sisters inhaled anxiously and even looked like they were considering  the deal.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to pass for now, as  tempting as it is!”</p>
<p>“Just please don’t attack us  again. It may not look like it, but you really did a number on us.”</p>
<p>“Before this serpent goes off the  deep end, would you know where this Nail might be?”</p>
<p>“She claims it’s going to be  used to break her out of a bad marriage.” Rose grinned  affectionately and laughed; she was starting to like this eclectic  crew.</p>
<p>“I’d definitely give it to you  if that were the case. I’m always advocating feminist freedom. I  hear they keep it on Saigrim’s moon, but that’s not a guarantee. I’ll bet if you sniff around, something’s bound to show  up…although I’d much prefer you sniff around my ship.” Her  crew bellowed with laughter and the Acheron sisters blushed before  being forced away from the feed. Naja stared at Rose for a long time  before finally giving her a bow of respect.</p>
<p>“Well, you’ve earned my  admiration, and my thanks. If you ever see any more envoys sent by  that troglodyte fiancé of mine—“</p>
<p>“That will be enough, you selfish  Elshyrin! How dare you push the magnanimous Dr. Miracle!!”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I just tell you to fuck  off, Rachel?! They’re not stupid enough to buy that  smoke-and-mirror routine!”</p>
<p>“And what does that say about you,  Naja—or anyone else aboard this ship? Meanie!”</p>
<p>“Brat!”</p>
<p>“Selfish snake!”</p>
<p>“Bimbo!”</p>
<p>“Psycho!”</p>
<p>“Airhead!”</p>
<p>“Please excuse them,” said the  Acheron sisters before they closed transmission. Rose and her crew  stood staring for a few moments before composing themselves.</p>
<p>“This was certainly an  unforgettable experience!” exclaimed the Captain. “Okay, ladies,  get off those pretty asses and get back to work! We ain’t gonna  let them hog all the fun! Set a new destination and re-supply the  cannons! With a will!”</p>
<p>“Aye, ma’am!”</p>
<p>The crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> and  the <em>Bloody Dove</em> parted for now, but surely in the grand scheme  of things, another meeting was not out of the question!</p>
