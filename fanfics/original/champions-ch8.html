<a href="../original/champions-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>I am a shadow in the dead of the night

I am a demon or I am a ghost

I am called fury, uncompromising

I have skin too thick for real love

I am a seraph, tainted by time

I am the end result of forced evolution

I see the world through the eyes of a child

I am immobile, and they fear my wrath

I am a machine who has forgotten her soul

Or am I a soul that dwells in the golem

I am venom, poison to the touch

Doomed to never know the feel of a lover

I am the one who lurks in the deep

I am rough poison, riches and sorrow

I am an angel who lost their way

I am a girl who lost her life

I am the one who takes care of them all

I drew them in from their own damning fall

I am the lost, the lost, the lost

I am the Lost, and so are you.

----------

Part Two: The Lost

I am called fury, uncompromising

I have skin too thick for real love

Whether writhing in hatred for those around me

Or bearing my smiles for those that I love

Dearest cage full of heart, serving others always

Tank with a soul, impervious to harm

But oh how fragile&#151;if they only knew!

Is my true hide, see, the one that I keep in the dark

All the more vulnerable, to all life&#39;s pains and wounds

I anger, you see, for my heart is too frail

----------

Rancor

I awoke very slowly, coming out of a dream that might not have been a 
dream, where I ran and found myself lost in trees and hills, going into 
places I had not seen before. This land was foreign to me, and to the 
shadows, which surprised me. They can be everywhere, so how can they not 
recognize the place? I awoke to darkness, thankfully, and the shadows 
gathered around me, waking me and assuring me that I was no longer in a 
dream. They were here with me, and everything was going to be all right, 
but they still didn&#39;t recognize the place. Dreams seeping into reality, 
the stuff of fancy made true, nightmares come to visit during the day&#151;or 
night.

&quot;Good morning,&quot; said a voice off to the side. My vision was unusually 
blurry, and I couldn&#39;t see in the dark&#151;what a catastrophe. I rubbed my 
eyes, shaking my head as if I was recovering from a hangover.

&quot;It&#39;s dark but I can&#39;t see,&quot; I muttered.

&quot;No, really?&quot;

&quot;I can see in the dark, idiot,&quot; I muttered.

&quot;Oh, okay. That&#39;s cool. Want me to turn on a light?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t see very well myself.&quot; Ignoring me, the person tapped a lantern 
and radiated a sphere of hateful brightness, although I guess it was 
hateful simply because it chased some dark away. It was really not a 
strong light at all, more sepia really, and enough for a regular person 
to see with. I could make out the girl, at least&#151;it was a girl, but she 
looked older than me. She was certainly taller and bulkier, as if the 
fat and the muscle were waging a war inside her body, and she had pink 
hair. I detest pink.

&quot;How ya doin&#39;?&quot; she asked, smiling despicably. I groaned and made a 
face.

&quot;I feel like I just got hit by a crowbar.&quot;

&quot;Yep, that&#39;s the specialty of the month: another victim of sleeping 
gas.&quot;

&quot;Sleeping gas?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Let me guess, you tried to fight the creepy man in white, but you 
couldn&#39;t hit him. Then this mist came...&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot; I wondered, feeling oddly pacifistic. In other words, 
I didn&#39;t feel the urge to rip her hair off her head and stuff it in her 
mouth.

&quot;Oh, well, you&#39;re not the first to try that. More like the second. But 
that&#39;s okay&#151;no harm done, eh?&quot; The woman-girl smiled brightly and jammed 
her thumb at her chest, nearly singing out, &quot;I&#39;m Rancor, if you&#39;re 
curious.&quot;

&quot;Nfh, nice name.&quot;

&quot;Well, Merry Lynn Weathers if ya wanna get technical, but Rancor&#39;s the 
name people gave me.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; she murmured offhand, &quot;just a little temper thing. Well, a big 
temper thing, really. I get mad...really easy, which is totally 
betraying my otherwise goofy nature.&quot; I snorted and finally felt normal 
as a sense of disgust came upon me. Ah, delicious.

&quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; I stood up slowly, feeling the entropy of my body after 
spending who knows how long a time asleep. I groaned, &quot;So where am I, 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lost.&quot; No, really? I snorted.

&quot;I could&#39;ve told you that. Where exactly?&quot;

&quot;I told you, you&#39;re lost.&quot;

I snorted and gave her a look that would&#39;ve turned grass brown and milk 
sour.

&quot;If you&#39;re here,&quot; said Rancor with a gesture, &quot;it means you&#39;re lost, 
whether by choice or design. They say I&#39;m lost as well, and I agree with 
them. That whole anger thing&#151;&quot;

&quot;They?&quot;

&quot;The guy who brought me here a month ago. Probably the same guy who 
brought you here.&quot;

&quot;But you said &#145;they&#39;, as in more than one.&quot;

&quot;Oh, did I?&quot; Rancor laughed out loud, confusing the belief that she had 
any anger in her system at all. &quot;Gosh, that was silly! I guess it&#39;s just 
dumb habit, like calling a group of girls &#145;you guys&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I...see.&quot; I managed not to growl. &quot;By the way, about the guy that 
brought me here: you think that was kidnapping or what? I mean, who does 
he think he is?&quot;

&quot;He says he&#39;s trying to help,&quot; said Rancor, serious and soft. &quot;I tried 
asking him questions, but he avoids every single one of them&#151;and he 
never stops smiling. He freaks me out.&quot; She shivered and nearly dropped 
the small lantern. I didn&#39;t know whether I wanted it to smash her foot 
or burn her hand.

&quot;So...is there a way out of here?&quot;

&quot;Mm, he&#39;ll let you out if you turn down his offer. The guy&#151;I call him 
Mr. White&#151;he makes you offers and lets you stay here where you&#39;ll be, 
quote, &#145;safe and no longer lost&#39;, whatever that means, if you take him 
up on his offer.&quot; I snorted again, finding the whole thing ridiculous 
and criminal. Make me an offer so I stay here, in this damned place? 
There wasn&#39;t anything out there big enough. Besides, nobody knows what I 
truly want, and nobody would care even if they did.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing he can say that would make me want to stay,&quot; I 
concluded.

&quot;Oh, I dunno, Mr. White makes very good offers. He promised me a place 
to stay, of course, and to help me with my anger management. As you can 
see, it&#39;s working tremendously.&quot; She grinned to prove it, which repulsed 
me even more.

&quot;Well, someone like you might be okay with that nonsense, but my goals 
are a lot higher. Tell him I refused and that I left.&quot; I took a few 
steps but stopped. A different kind of darkness was around me, like 
something foreign which I&#39;ve never bathed in before. The shadows were 
afraid to go on&#151;they&#39;d rather be nearer the light that Rancor gave off! 
For a moment I couldn&#39;t blame them; it was like a kid taking their first 
steps into a haunted forest.

Haunted forest, where even the shadows don&#39;t know their way around...

&quot;How do you get out of here, anyway?&quot; I asked.

&quot;Mr. White decides when you go. Luckily he usually gives me freedom to 
come and go whenever I like, but sometimes I have to stay. Nine times 
out of ten, I&#39;m outs&#151;&quot;

&quot;Never mind,&quot; I sighed. I sat down, but became oddly fearful of the 
alien darkness, and scooted closer to Rancor. She was disgusting, ugly, 
juvenile, and she had that godforsaken light, but in the entire world, 
she was the only person I could go to in order to escape the strange 
barrier. How vile, me needing people...

&quot;So, I never got your name.&quot; I kept silent. &quot;May I have it?&quot;

&quot;Why? I&#39;m going to leave as soon as that guy comes here.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; she sang. &quot;At least tell me your name. I&#39;d really 
like to know.&quot;

&quot;Sta&#151;&quot; I stopped myself in mid-sentence and reconsidered. Nobody knew me 
here. I was the proverbial stranger in a strange land, and could be 
known however I wished. I made up my mind and used a lesser-known alias 
of mine, &quot;Kagemusha.&quot;

&quot;Kagemusha? That&#39;s a cool name. What&#39;s it mean?&quot;

&quot;...Shadow Warrior.&quot;

&quot;Cool!!&quot;

Oh, brother.

......

I was stuck between avoiding Rancor and avoiding the strange darkness 
that kept me from leaving. She wanted to socialize to pass the time, but 
I set her straight with a few harsh words and was able to bathe in 
silence. Ten minutes later, though, the stillness of the room got to 
her, and she broke down and babbled some more. I never share myself with 
anybody, least of all a person I can&#39;t stand, and I usually make it 
clear with a threat. But this bitch would...not...shut...up!

The darkness around me would not permit a death. The scum would have to 
live.

Or...

The world felt weighed down around me as a sensation of dread, horror, 
violence and mystery shrouded the room. Rancor bolted up and waved.

&quot;Hello, Mr. White! Guess what, she&#39;s awake!&quot;

The creepy man in white had returned. About damned time.

&quot;Oh, if it isn&#39;t the kidnapper. What do you want?&quot; He stood and smiled, 
frightening and illuminating as ever, and my nerve nearly left me. I 
couldn&#39;t stand looking into his face for long, and even being around him 
made me weak and scared. Who was this guy? Why did I feel so strange 
around him?

&quot;Dear child, I am afraid I shall have to correct you. I very much wanted 
you to be here, but your barbaric refusal left me with only one choice, 
to bring you here in a more...sedated form. I do apologize for the 
theatrics, but...no harm done, is there? Good. Let us get down to 
business.&quot;

&quot;Look, I already heard it from miss tall and pink over there,&quot; I 
muttered, pointing to Rancor. &quot;You basically want to make me an offer, 
right? One I can&#39;t refuse, or I&#39;m not supposed to? Well, forget it. 
There&#39;s nothing you can say that will make me want to stay in this 
cesspool any longer.&quot; I turned to leave, but whether it was by his voice 
or the bleak wall around the room, I could not leave.

&quot;Please, wait. Hear me out. Listen to my offer, child. You do not even 
know what it is I intend to exchange with you.&quot;

&quot;Probably nothing good,&quot; I spat, &quot;but I might as well humor you if I 
can&#39;t kill you. Spill it.&quot; He smiled and raised his head just enough for 
me to see his face. I shuddered and looked away from his eternal smile.

&quot;You have such skepticism, my child, but I know that my promises will 
change your mind. When I am done talking, you will entreat me to stay, 
and I will allow it.&quot;

&quot;Get to the point.&quot;

&quot;All in good time...Amielle Celestino Yeshua.&quot;

My heart jerked in surprise, knocking itself against my ribcage as I 
heard the creature before me utter out my full, real name, the one given 
to me at birth.

&quot;How did you know--?&quot; I demanded. His smile became broader.

&quot;Oh, I know quite a bit about you, Amielle Yeshua&#151;or should I call you 
Celestino? I think you would be more comfortable with that name, my 
dear.&quot; I felt like stumbling and nearly did. I had to clutch onto myself 
just to keep from falling. Rancor&#39;s presence was gone; she could&#39;ve been 
asleep, dead, or taking a piss for all I knew. It was just me and...him.

&quot;How did you...&quot;

&quot;Like I said, I know a lot about you. Maybe as much as you do. For the 
sake of convenience and your...happiness, I shall refer to you as 
Kagemusha, because it is how you refer to yourself&#151;here, anyway. I do 
not think you appreciate being addressed by your human name.&quot; I couldn&#39;t 
answer, but I probably didn&#39;t need to. I managed to take a step 
backwards.

&quot;I&#39;m leaving,&quot; I whispered, trying to make it sound like a threat. &quot;And 
you can take your stupid offer and...go to Hell.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; he sighed as my back turned, &quot;but if you leave now, I cannot help 
you save your mother.&quot;

Dead things gather round the rotting tree,

Dance all night and fill your throats with blood.

I see the vultures crashing into your bones,

Can you suffer the hateful smile of the sun?

Bodies freeze now in the suffering desert,

Know you that I shall not live for the morrow.

Vague chance kills me, I know not your name,

And you, my friend, shall not see home again.

True shock can only be expressed with haunting beauty.

&quot;I struck a chord, did I not?&quot; I remained frozen. &quot;I was correct after 
all. There is something in your life that keeps you from being 
completely unredeemable. You are lost, my dear, as is Rancor, but here 
in this place, here with me, you may yet find direction out of the 
woods. I offer you assistance with your mother, which I know you seek. 
It is the only thing keeping you, and dare I suggest it, all of humanity 
alive. It is a blessing in the disguise of a chain. A welcome anchor in 
a sea of troubles. I can help you, Kagemusha, but you must first accept 
my offer. Or...you could refuse, and return to the streets as a whore 
for money. It is your choice.&quot;

Damnation.

No poetry could suffice.

He said it was my choice, but really, I had no choice. I had to accept. 
For her.

Chains; he was right. This phantom has a past, O Man, and it keeps her 
chained to the world. I am the Lost, and so are you.

&quot;What must I do?&quot; I whispered hoarsely. He laid a tender hand on me that 
calmed all my fears and saw my doubts swirl down into a bottomless 
drain. I felt no ire, only peace, such as I&#39;ve not felt in many 
forgettable years.

&quot;When the time comes, I shall tell you. Until then, I free you, to look 
around and to acquaint yourself with this place. As of now, the Lost are 
only two strong in number, but soon there will be more. I want you and 
Rancor to go out into the world and find these Lost, and bring them to 
me, wherein I shall give them my offer. I sincerely hope they will 
accept&#151;after all, the more the merrier, eh?&quot;

I wanted to sneer, to shudder, and to strike him, but there was too much 
peace in me. I sighed as I felt his hand move, and wished that it had 
not. Such love...such power...

&quot;Yo! Whoo-hoo! Kagemusha! You in? Wow, you look really spaced!&quot; I 
blinked as I saw a perky, curious face in front of mine, covered in pink 
hair. I growled and smashed it out of my way, sending the fool straight 
to the floor. She groaned, laughed, and apologized all at once, but just 
to make sure she didn&#39;t try something again, I stepped on Rancor&#39;s 
stomach and hurled myself as far away from her as I possibly could.

I didn&#39;t see Mr. White for quite some time.

.........

I was glad to finally have a friend, even an antisocial one. Living 
alone as the first member of The Lost took its toll on me. I&#39;m a strange 
kind of girl, clingy and desperate for company, but I scared off all my 
friends with my temper. I thought I had a few that were loyal, but after 
I nearly killed someone out of hatred, even they left me, and now I&#39;m 
all alone. I don&#39;t know a soul in the world and I&#39;m left to define the 
meaning of life all by myself. What was I supposed to do? You&#39;re not 
just born into this world; everyone is meant to do something, and I 
could not accept being born to create misery.

When I was alone, I came to realize very quickly that I would be barred 
from love. It&#39;s my thick skin, isn&#39;t it? Nobody would want to get in so 
close, and who knows when I&#39;ll be set off, and by what! Being a vessel 
of constant hatred isn&#39;t enough; I have to have special powers as well, 
something that alienates me from the rest of the people. I can turn my 
skin into armor, see, and that makes it really hard for attacks to get 
through to me. I&#39;m like a tank&#151;but all tanks are hollow on the inside, 
and can only be operated by somebody else, somebody on the outside. I&#39;m 
just a hollow tank operating on its own steam, no different than a 
monster.

I went seeking help and found MERCS, which in turn led me to meet Dr. 
Kamaguchi. She sent me on an errand where my anger was a 
bonus&#151;demolition, it was&#151;and afterwards, directed me to a place where 
even my unique abilities would be appreciated and even desired. That&#39;s 
how I met Mr. White. He offered me a real home of sorts, and said that 
he could help me with my rage. What I really wanted was to cope with my 
losses: my friends, my family, any and all lovers, even my own sense of 
self. I needed a guide, someone to steer the tank, and he assured me I 
would get one. Well, it took a month, but here I am now, finally with a 
friend. And she wants nothing to do with me.

It shocked me to learn that Kagemusha was only 15 years old&#151;that was ten 
years younger than me! She looked and acted much older! It definitely 
surprised me, and I had to refrain from calling her a kid. That deadly 
stare of hers suggested strength and skill well beyond the limits of 
age. I kept my distance, but never gave up trying to get her to open up. 
Maybe her own sense of loneliness will one day cause her to break out of 
her shell&#151;to emerge from her own tank, and to befriend me. There&#39;s no 
way in Hell I&#39;d ever start a romance with somebody so young, but that&#39;s 
okay. We aren&#39;t the only ones lost in this world.

----------

May the Lost find their way home, wherever it is, whenever it may be.

In the next chapter, the Lost are sent on their first mission. They must 
recruit one who was tainted by time, one who seeks answers to her life, 
one who has been a prisoner. She too is lost, but will she be able to 
find a new path when she meets up with the others?

Find out in the next chapter, &quot;Marissa&quot;.</pre>
