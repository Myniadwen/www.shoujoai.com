<h1>Project Angelus (part 20 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>      &quot;Subject 5A is working properly...&quot; Eric muttered to himself as he jotted down notes. 
&quot;7C and 9A are failing while 3B is functioning slowly than I would like...&quot;

      He glanced back up at the large, glass containers in front of him, each taking up 
space in the lab as though they were pillars. They were filled with liquid and inside were 
varying organisms... except Eric knew they weren&#39;t exactly the organisms he wanted. After 
much tinkering and years of work, all he could get was a functioning respiratory and 
circulatory system.

      The young professor chewed on the tip of his pencil in frustration. Even with Alice&#39;s 
DNA, he could only try to coax an artificial version of her into existence... yet all he 
had was a heart and a pair of lungs. Sure, he could actually get a woman to give birth to 
an identical copy of Alice, but that wasn&#39;t what he wanted.

      He wanted to build up a life form with Alice&#39;s exact DNA profile and then augment it 
with nano technology to advance her age. She wouldn&#39;t be Alice at all, but it would be 
better than nothing... and if he could create a doll that looked like her, then maybe...

      &quot;Dr. Ackhart?&quot; He looked up at the sound of his name. Erin was timidly standing at 
the entrance, closing the door behind her.

      &quot;Come on in... I&#39;m just making a couple of test tube babies,&quot; Eric said cheerfully, 
setting down the pencil. &quot;I&#39;m trying to clone a dead girl.&quot;

      Erin just stared at him for a moment and he figured she was pretending he didn&#39;t saw 
that as she came over with the papers he requested. &quot;These are some of the remaining files 
on Project Angelus from the Defense sector of the organization.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, setting them down on the desk. He noticed Erin looking at the 
pumping heart in the container. &quot;It&#39;s not much of a baby, I know. It&#39;s kind of a crappy 
start to an experiment...&quot;

      &quot;Isn&#39;t this... um... unethical?&quot; Erin traversed awkwardly.

      Eric looked at her and then back at the thing in the container. &quot;I suppose. But so 
was the girl&#39;s murder.&quot;

      &quot;Who was she?&quot;

      Eric motioned over to board with a myriad of pictures tacked onto it. Erin could only 
assume that the girl in all the pictures was Alice. Most of them were cut out just to show 
the dirty blonde girl posing happily. &quot;This is her?&quot;

      &quot;Yep... Alice Bailey.&quot; He began to sift through the papers. &quot;If you see any remnants 
of another girl, that would be Mariah. She&#39;s dead too.&quot;

      Erin looked back over at him. &quot;Why are they both dead?&quot;

      &quot;Courtesy of Lilith,&quot; Eric said with a sigh. &quot;Lilith was essentially the death of 
Mariah and Miki... Alice... well, Adrian took care of her rather coldly.&quot;

      &quot;So Lilith killed Mariah and... Miki...&quot; Erin murmured, walking back over to him.

      &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Eric replied. &quot;Thanks again for the files.&quot;

      &quot;What do you intend to do with... with those?&quot; Erin asked pointing at the various 
little clones of Alice.

      &quot;I&#39;m going to create a physical replication of Alice around the age of... maybe 
around the age of 15.&quot; Eric picked up his pencil and scribbled down some more notes on a 
notepad. &quot;If Adrian keeps his word, then I won&#39;t have to worry about this little pet 
project of mine.&quot;

      Erin started to get increasingly uncomfortable. &quot;I... I think I&#39;ll check on Dark...&quot; 
The snake goddess left without another word, no longer sure about the intentions of her 
employer. She had believed that Eric could be a possible ally, but it may be better just to 
add him to the list of offensive forces.

      As she continued down the hall, she heard a familiar voice. &quot;Miss Schlange.&quot;

      Erin let a smile creep up on her face as Faye came over to her, all professional 
like. &quot;Is it time to check on Dark?&quot; the love goddess asked.

      &quot;Yes, we should get going,&quot; Erin said. As they headed down the hall, they passed by 
Lilith, who was stalking towards Eric&#39;s lab.

      Erin pinched Faye in the arm as the red head gazed at the young woman&#39;s retreating 
body. &quot;Ow! Not so hard...&quot;

      &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be looking at her like that,&quot; Erin muttered.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Faye said, rubbing her arm. &quot;You have to admit that she&#39;s rather 
attractive and your eyes follow that tattoo of hers.&quot;

      Erin stopped in front of door 420A with a sigh. The couple entered the door and shut 
it carefully behind them. The snake goddess continued her reasoning, &quot;I doubt everyone else 
will be enthusiastic about us trying to screw a major enemy.&quot;

      &quot;It could lead to her switching sides,&quot; Faye tried weakly.

      &quot;I&#39;m not going to have a threesome with a man, nor will I have it with a murderer,&quot; 
Erin said firmly, crushing her lover&#39;s hopes.

      &quot;...but she is really hot...&quot; Faye breathed out.

      &quot;I know,&quot; Erin said with a smile. &quot;But being hot doesn&#39;t mean that we should do that 
kind of thing. It might blow our cover if we constantly try to hit on her.&quot;

      The love goddess shrugged. &quot;But like I said, it could be beneficial.&quot;

      Erin just laughed as she continued down the hallway to Dark&#39;s room. &quot;I&#39;d much rather 
do it with a girl we actually like.&quot;

      Faye couldn&#39;t really argue with that. &quot;Carmilla would try to kill us if we did that 
with Tsuru again... Hoshi said she couldn&#39;t because her sisters would get jealous...&quot;

      &quot;And Dark is incapacitated,&quot; Erin said with a slight groan.

      &quot;I still don&#39;t know if you&#39;re serious about that or not,&quot; Faye muttered. &quot;I wonder... 
is our sex so dull that we need to have a third person?&quot;

      &quot;It makes things more interesting,&quot; Erin pointed out. &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean I 
dislike it when it&#39;s just the two of us.&quot;

      Faye grinned at her. &quot;Well that makes me very, very glad. I was about to get jealous 
of Dark and her cuteness.&quot;

      The two women looked over at the sleeping angel in the bed, now without any of the 
restricting wires from before. &quot;16... is that legal...?&quot; Erin whispered before pausing. 
&quot;Wow... I feel like a creepy predator now. You must be rubbing off on me too much.&quot;

      Faye just laughed at her. &quot;Oh please, you&#39;re the Goddess of Serpents - you should be 
preying on people.&quot;

      &quot;Well,&quot; Erin said, taking some offense to it. &quot;At least my powers don&#39;t manifest as a 
bondage device.&quot;

      &quot;Snakes are oddly kinky though...&quot;

      Erin just pinched Faye in the arm again. &quot;Posh-Posh finds that offensive.&quot;

      There was a sound of a jingle and Faye looked down to see the tiny snake slithering 
out from under a table... and he was giving her the best death glare he could muster up.

      &quot;I love you,&quot; Faye said to Erin, trying to dispel any of the earlier hostilities.

      &quot;I know,&quot; she said with a sigh, going over to Dark. &quot;Just try not to pounce on Lilith 
while we&#39;re working here?&quot;

      &quot;Alright...&quot; Faye groaned out. &quot;But that would be like me telling you to keep your 
hands off of Dark...&quot;

      &quot;But you think she&#39;s cute too,&quot; Erin countered as the angel began to wake up to the 
sounds of the two women at her bedside.

      Faye looked over as the girl started to get up, by shyly curled back up into the bed. 
&quot;She is much too cute for her own good.&quot;

      Erin looked down at the floor, blushing. &quot;I really think there must be something 
wrong with us if we&#39;re trying to go after a young girl like this... the Guardian of Light, 
no less.&quot;

      Faye cringed at that. &quot;You don&#39;t think the angels would be upset if we did anything 
with her, do you?&quot;

      Dark just covered her now bright red face with the blanket, happy that she was 
slightly ignorant to what they were talking about. 

***** 

      Miki awoke with a start before the blood rushed to her head and caused her to fall 
back on the comfortable bedspread. &quot;Oh, you&#39;re awake.&quot;

      Hina&#39;s voice made the girl try to sit up again, but Tsuki quickly pushed her back 
down. &quot;Don&#39;t get up too fast - you should rest.&quot;

      &quot;Uh... wha...?&quot; Miki was trying to comprehend where she was and exactly what was 
going on.

      &quot;Hoshi said you passed out,&quot; Hina murmured, motioning over to her big sister.

      Miki&#39;s heart sank as Hoshi gave her a devious smile from across the hotel room. Tsuki 
and Hina exchanged glances, having already figured out exactly what happened. &quot;I... I think 
I&#39;m going to uh...&quot; Miki realized how dirty and sweaty she felt. &quot;...take a shower.&quot;

      No sooner had those words left her mouth that all three sisters became alert. Miki 
didn&#39;t quite understand why they began to giggle, but she really, really wanted to be in 
Eveon&#39;s room... &quot;Sure!&quot; Hina said happily, pulling Miki off of the bed.

      &quot;Let&#39;s go take a bath,&quot; Tsuki said, guiding Miki towards the bathroom.

      &quot;Let&#39;s...?&quot; The green eyed girl asked.

      &quot;Of course,&quot; Hoshi said, following them into the bathroom. &quot;Why should we take turns 
when we can all do it together?&quot;

      Miki grasped onto the doorway to the bathroom. &quot;Are you serious?! N-no way!&quot; 

***** 

      Eveon awoke from her nap at the sound of pounding on her door. &quot;Eveon! Please open 
the door!&quot;

      The blonde took her time and when she did open the hotel door for Miki, the green 
eyed girl was already surrounded by the sisters. &quot;Save me,&quot; Miki squeaked out pathetically.

      &quot;We were just going to help Miki take a bath...&quot; Hina murmured, tugging on the girl&#39;s 
arm.

      &quot;She&#39;s still tired from everything that&#39;s happened today,&quot; Tsuki added, taking Miki&#39;s 
other arm.

      &quot;We&#39;re just going to help her out,&quot; Hoshi finished, clasping her hands on Miki&#39;s 
shoulders.

      Eveon nodded slowly, not believing them. &quot;Right... not like you were intending to 
inappropriately touch her in the bathroom or anything...&quot;

      Miki launched herself in the room, almost tackling Eveon. &quot;I think you have your 
answer right there,&quot; Eveon said, motioning to the girl now crawling to the bathroom.

      &quot;Girls tend to be fluid with their sexuality, so I&#39;m sure Miki will come around,&quot; 
Hoshi said with a smile. Her sisters seemed to agree, but started to laugh anyways.

      &quot;She&#39;s just really funny,&quot; Hina said.

      &quot;Ah, but I guess we&#39;ll take a bath without her,&quot; Tsuki sighed, pulling on Hoshi&#39;s 
sleeve. &quot;Let&#39;s go, big sister!&quot;

      The silver haired woman flushed a bright red as her sisters led her back to the room, 
with the intention of having some sisterly bonding. Eveon shut the door as the shower 
started in the bathroom. She felt bad for Miki... It would be as if a bunch of guys were 
trying to hit on her...

      Eveon shuddered at the thought, knowing that Mina would be pissed if that were to 
ever happen. The blonde sat back down on the bed, staring at her right hand. The seal began 
to glow in a white light and the young girl let out a sigh. Why did she have to be the one 
with a huge burden?

      A few minutes passed and Miki shyly peeked out of the bathroom, finished with her 
shower. &quot;Eveon... do you have any extra clothes?&quot;

      Miki must have left her bag in the sisters&#39; room when she ran to keep her virginity 
intact... &quot;Yeah, hold on...&quot; Eveon rooted around her own duffel bag and presented a set of 
clothes. Miki just stared at her for a while. &quot;What? Didn&#39;t you want clothes?&quot;

      &quot;Uh... can you hand them to me?&quot;

      Eveon stared before walking over, rolling her eyes. &quot;God, Miki. If you come out just 
wearing a towel, I&#39;m not going to rape you. I do have girlfriend you know...&quot;

      &quot;Yeah, well that&#39;s not stopping them, is it?&quot; Miki took the clothes. &quot;Thank you, 
Eveon.&quot;

      &quot;True... I guess they aren&#39;t really exclusive...&quot; Eveon trailed off. &quot;If you ever 
meet two other women I know, Faye and Erin, you&#39;d really better watch out. They like to 
&#39;help&#39; girls out.&quot;

      &quot;Help?&quot; Miki paused, still hiding her body behind the door. &quot;Oh... help... like not 
actual helping...&quot;

      Eveon could only wonder how their spy mission was going at the Shadow Organization...
