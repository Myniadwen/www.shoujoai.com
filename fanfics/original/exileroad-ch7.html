<a href="../original/exileroad-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The tall black haired woman followed Jantha inside the
gate, her eyes roaming warily. Midori felt the eyes of
the nobles they passed resting on her but simply
ignored it, carrying a simple staff with her and
wearing her usual black leather and rough wool
clothes.

Duchess Jantha followed behind, the smaller blonde
frowning slightly as they walked the halls of the
castle. &quot;You couldn&#39;t have worn something finer?&quot; she
asked pointedly, her own gown flowing like silk.

&quot;They aren&#39;t going to be paying attention to me,&quot;
Midori said shortly.

Behind Jantha the tawny haired woman followed like a
typical servant, her own much more simple dress
hugging her body. &quot;At least you&#39;re not in disguise,&quot;
Laur&#39;ien said with a wry smile, her searching gaze as
sharp as Midori&#39;s.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky someone could lend you the dress,&quot;
Jantha sighed. She paused, &quot;I though you two said that
you weren&#39;t going to use disguises?&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t,&quot; Laur&#39;ien smiled impishly, &quot;but the rules
of court say that a noble may only have one guard, but
they also allow servants.&quot;

&quot;Better to bend a rule than break it,&quot; Midori said
philosophically.

Jantha sighed, wondering which god she had annoyed to
be saddled with these two. They strode towards the
main hall, fine tapestries hanging on the walls,
guards spaced out with spear held ready and swords at
their side. &quot;With all of these guards around,&quot; she
mildly noted, &quot;one wonders why I need to have you two
here.&quot;

Laur&#39;ien quietly answered, &quot;Because you don&#39;t know who
else these guards might be taking gold from, Duchess.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t trust anyone, do you?&quot; Jantha asked with a
pained expression.

Midori answered that one, &quot;No, I don&#39;t.&quot;

They reached the doors to the great hall, made of the
finest oak ad towering over them, even Midori. The
guard standing there nodded to Jantha and pointedly
ignored Laur&#39;ien, but his eyes widened at seeing
Midori. &quot;No weapons,&quot; he said curtly, looking at her
staff.

&quot;It&#39;s not a weapon, tis merely my walking stick,&quot;
Midori said mildly. She smiled slightly as she
recognized the young man, a boy who had once been a
bit disruptive at the Drunken Bard one night. &quot;Did
that arm I broke heal up all right?&quot; she asked
politely.

He smiled wryly, &quot;Well enough.&quot; Studying her a moment
the young guard finally smiled, &quot;Go on in, but please
don&#39;t start anything.&quot;

&quot;Never do,&quot; was Midori&#39;s quiet reply.

The doors swung open for them as they entered, the
page standing by the door studying them a moment.
clearing his voice before he loudly announced, &quot;The
Duchess Jantha, honored cousin to the Queen, and her
companions!&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re just companions now,&quot; Laur&#39;ien murmured as
they walked inside the audience chamber, nobility and
diplomats swirling around them in the packed hall.

&quot;Did you really break his arm?&quot; Jantha had to ask.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Midori answered, using her size to help clear
the road for them. &quot;He got drunk and surly, an&#39;
decided to see if I could live up to my reputation.&quot;

&quot;Reputation?&quot; Jantha sounded mildly disapproving.

Laur&#39;ien looked amused as she murmured, &quot;It&#39;s all over
the guard&#39;s barracks that nobody has beaten Midori
yet, and with her just using that staff against
swords.&quot; She looked amused as she added, &quot;Part of why
the commander hired her, I&#39;d bet.&quot;

They pressed forward, soon getting within line of
sight of the simple throne that rested in the far end
from the doors. The Queen bore a resemblance to
Jantha, the slim blonde sitting on her throne bravely
as she felt all eyes upon her. The woman&#39;s wasn&#39;t all
that beautiful, but there was strength and character
in her bones and faintly amused gaze.

&quot;My Queen,&quot; Jantha executed a graceful curtsey, her
smile warm. She dropped her voice a bit, &quot;You look
well, Queen Gwen.&quot;

&quot;Cousin,&quot; Gwen answered, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you.&quot; She
took in Midori and Laur&#39;ien, nodding approvingly as
she said, &quot;I see Commander Hudson has been busy.&quot;

&quot;I still don&#39;t think all of this is necessary,&quot; Jantha
sighed.

&quot;You are one of my best courtiers and have been loyal
to me,&quot; Gwen answered mildly, &quot;I would not see that
repaid by treachery.&quot; She frowned, &quot;Especially
considering the fearsome assassins after you, the
Genin.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Jantha conceded the point.

Midori watched the room warily, only listening with
half an ear as she scanned the crowd. &#39;Apparently
Jantha is closer to the throne than I thought,&#39; she
noted. The people around them were a mixed group, both
the local representatives and those from farther
lands. Among them courtiers loyal to Gwen circulated,
trying to build support to their new queen.

The older man looked up, black hair tinged with gray
and as Midori&#39;s glance crossed his she felt herself
stiffen in surprise. &#39;How the hell did he....&#39; it took
all of Midori&#39;s experience to keep her reaction from
her face, and she was mildly pleased to see the other
man lacked her control. The pale man almost gaped at
her in surprise, then began to move toward them.

Laur&#39;ien tensed as she looked between Midori and the
strange man, even as Jantha looked on in confusion.
&quot;The delegate from Edo,&quot; she frowned, &quot;what is he
doing?&quot;

&quot;Can you watch over the Duchess a moment?&quot; Midori
asked.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Laur&#39;ien volunteered, a twinkle in her
eye showing her curiosity.

Addressing Jantha a visibly apologetic Midori said,
&quot;This is old business, m&#39;lady, and personal. Please,
let me deal with it.&quot;

Jantha frowned slightly but nodded her agreement.
&quot;Just do so quickly,&quot; Jantha hesitated before
conceding, &quot;I would feel uncomfortable without your
protection.&quot;

Midori angled through the crowd to meet the smaller
man, taking in the comfortable robes he wore, the
katana at his side. He stopped before her and Midori
almost thought he would execute a formal bow, like he
would have once in their homeland. &quot;Midori-dono, it
has been a long time,&quot; he said to her in their native
tongue.

&quot;Not dono, Sasoke.&quot; Midori shook her head firmly as
she felt eyes resting on both of them, &quot;I renounced my
title long ago.&quot;

&quot;It is not so simple, lord,&quot; he answered. Sasoke
smiled wryly, his black hair falling into his eyes as
he continued, &quot;Not all of us feel oaths of loyalty are
so easily disregarded.&quot;

Midori sighed, thankful that his words were not
directed to her own situation. &quot;You must have sworn
your oaths to the Shogun now,&quot; she reminded him, &quot;or
you would not be here.&quot;

&quot;But....&quot; Sasoke began.

&quot;Just leave the past buried,&quot; Midori said crisply,
turning away to walk back to Jantha&#39;s side, &quot;where it
belongs.&quot;

&quot;That was fast,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said dryly once Midori
returned to where the two women were standing by the
throne.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Jantha asked quietly.

&#39;It seems I&#39;m easier to read than I thought,&#39; Midori
noted. &quot;Did anything happen?&quot; she asked impatiently,
ignoring the question.

&quot;Well we were attacked by a horde of assassins, but
Jantha and I rallied the guards and fought them all
off with minimal casualties,&quot; Laur&#39;ien said airily.

&quot;No, nothing happened,&quot; Jantha said firmly. She smiled
slightly, &quot;But my sister the queen wishes to talk to
me, privately.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re coming along,&quot; Midori said crisply.

&quot;How did I know you were going to say that?&quot; Laur&#39;ien
asked.

Jantha ignored that. &quot;I don&#39;t think my sister will
mind my servant or bodyguard,&quot; she dryly responded,
&quot;come with me.&quot;</pre>
