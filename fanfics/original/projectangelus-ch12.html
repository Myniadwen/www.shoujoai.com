<h1>Project Angelus (part 12 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>      &quot;We have saved a good amount of the population and are treating to the injured,&quot; a 
Shadow Organization soldier relayed to his commander.

      &quot;Good... have we secured the perimeter of the church yet?&quot;

      &quot;Yes sir, but there seems to be a larger monstrosity near the church and we have 
reason to believe that somebody may still be inside.&quot;

      The commander got ready to bark out his orders until someone cut in.

      &quot;I can go and save whoever it is,&quot; came a soft voice.

      The two men standing by their black jeep whirled around to see a 14 year old girl. 
&quot;I&#39;m Alice Bailey,&quot; she said with a smile. &quot;I don&#39;t work for you guys, but I got 
subcontracted. Or something.&quot;

      &quot;Alice...&quot; the commander murmured. &quot;Let me guess, Professor Ackhart directed you 
here?&quot;

      She nodded and the commander motioned to the church in the distance. &quot;Don&#39;t try any 
fancy stuff - just get whoever is in there out.&quot;

      She wasted no time heading down there, drawing her sword.

      The soldier swallowed awkwardly. &quot;We&#39;re letting a child down there rather than our 
extermination team?&quot;

      &quot;She&#39;s Adrian&#39;s little sister and Ackhart&#39;s little... I don&#39;t know. He speaks highly 
of her, so...&quot; The commander watched her through the binoculars. &quot;Well she just took out 
three of those stray monsters, so that&#39;s a good sign.&quot; 

***** 

      Mariah figured it was a good idea to get out of the office as soon as she could. Once 
that happened, a huge monster burst through the stained glass windows, screeching and 
baring its sharp teeth. She froze for a moment, mesmerized by its sharp claws and black, 
lanky structure. It had no eyes, no ears, but it seemed to know exactly where she was.

      She let out a scream as its tongue shot out and yanked on her ankle. Out of 
desperation, she grabbed a piece of broken glass and attempted to slice it off before the 
thing could pull her into that jagged pit of teeth. She didn&#39;t want to die - not like this. 
She almost let out a yell when she finally severed the tongue and black blood began to gush 
out.

      The monster let out an inhuman sound that reminded her to get off of the glass ridden 
floor and run regardless of her body&#39;s condition. Now wasn&#39;t the time to stick around to 
see what was happening. She had locked the church&#39;s front doors so she wasted no time 
heading for the small library and emergency exit.

      Her stomach twisted as she passed over the priest&#39;s body - she couldn&#39;t stop to give 
him a moment&#39;s glance. The monster was right on her tail... but it stopped. As she shut the 
door to the library, she could hear the sound of something crunching and pushed a bookcase 
in front of it.

      The thing out there was eating the priest&#39;s remains. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry,&quot; she whispered 
and began to say a little prayer.

      She screamed as something slammed against the door and jostled the bookcase. Mariah 
raced through the emergency exit as the monster cracked through the wood with its claws and 
teeth. As soon as she came outside, she barely avoided a dog&#39;s fangs trying to grab at her 
leg.

      Mariah looked around her to see that a myriad of creatures were gathered in the empty 
lot beside the church, all ready to pounce on her. She smacked one away with her book and 
let out a relieved sigh as they suddenly ran off. She assumed it was fear of something and 
when she heard the emergency exit door explode off its hinges, she had her answer.

      The thing creeping through the door to eat her had scared everything off and Mariah 
started to flip through the spell book as fast as she could. There had to be something 
there to help her or- or- was this God&#39;s way of punishing her for studying the occult in 
the first place? Was she going to die a horrible death of being eaten alive?

      Just as it opened its mouth to reveal its still injured tongue, Mariah shut her eyes 
and prayed. Luckily for her, a certain Alice Bailey jumped off the roof and landed on the 
monster, plunging her sword through its head and shutting its grotesque mouth.

      The 14 year old was happy that the church had a fire escape for her to use and that 
she noticed the monster in time... it started to writhe around and succeeded in launching 
the young girl in the air. Alice landed on her butt, bloody sword in hand, before racing in 
front of the dazed Mariah. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      &quot;...yes... yes I am,&quot; she said, clutching the book to herself.

      &quot;Help is going to arrive soon,&quot; Alice said, holding her sword confidently, though she 
was secretly just as frightened. She&#39;d never fought anything this big or monstrous - taking 
care of the mutated dogs were one thing and now she had to fight something like this?

      When it reached out one of its claws to attack, it was immediately deflected away by 
a light. &quot;...what?&quot; Alice said looking around. Then she noticed the same light coming from 
behind her.

      &quot;It... it works...&quot; Mariah said, mostly to herself. &quot;It really works! The shield 
spell actually works...!&quot;

      Her hand was on the spell book, the words on it glowing. Alice just stared. 
&quot;...that&#39;s so cool...&quot; the young girl murmured. &quot;Can you shoot fireballs too?!&quot;

      &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t- watch out!&quot; Alice whirled around to see the demon trying to tackle them 
instead. She pushed the older girl aside and ran at the monster.

      As it flew through the air, Alice disappeared beneath it and stuck up her sword. By 
using her momentum and the monster&#39;s, she gutted it as though it were nothing more than a 
tiny fish. It collapsed into the ground, almost as though it was just jello with bones.

      &quot;Ew...&quot; Alice moaned as she tried to wipe off the black blood. The only problem with 
gutting the darn thing was that she got showered by its insides...

      &quot;Are you alright?!&quot; Mariah asked as she went over to her.

      &quot;Yeah... just... a little violated is all...&quot; Alice shuddered as some of the stuff 
went down her shirt. &quot;You don&#39;t look too good yourself... are you okay?&quot;

      Mariah just gave her a confused look until she felt some of the stinging pain on her 
back and hand. &quot;Oh, no... I just felt on some broken glass when that... whatever broke into 
the church,&quot; Mariah said with a sigh. &quot;Thank you for saving me... but just... what 
happened?&quot;

      Alice scratched her head. &quot;Well... uh... the Shadow Organization does a lot of 
research pertaining to medicine and killing evil demons... but... a nasty man made monster 
has been breaking into the facilities and releasing and mutating some of the experiments.&quot; 
She motioned to the dead monster on the ground. &quot;They were originally animals testing the 
different effects of drugs before the monster got to them.&quot; 

      &quot;So this is all some biomedical mix up? Innocent people are dying! The priest in 
there... he- he-!&quot;

      Mariah started to wipe at her tears. &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alice said. &quot;I&#39;m trying to do 
the best I can.&quot;

      She just shook her head. &quot;No... no it&#39;s not you... it&#39;s not your fault...!&quot;

      They waited there in silence before the soldiers came to their rescue, along with 
medics. 

*****  

      &quot;You did a great job!&quot; Alice was sitting in a Shadow Organization standard issue 
guest room, drying her hair when Eric came in. After the nasty aftermath of the fight, 
she&#39;d been given a place to temporary clean up and stay.

      &quot;Oh... thanks,&quot; Alice said with a smile.

      Eric looked at her and flushed red. She was just... too cute! So maybe it was weird 
that he really liked the little girl and wanted to be her boyfriend. He was 21 and she was 
14... but seven years wasn&#39;t a lot. Not at all! Shoot - once she was an adult, it wouldn&#39;t 
make a difference!

      At least... he kept telling himself that. Four years. Eric would have to wait four 
years or risk Alice thinking him a total freak. Not that he wasn&#39;t already, being the top 
researcher of the organization and at such a young age...

      &quot;...Eric?&quot; His head snapped up. He&#39;d been staring at the floor during all his 
thinking, totally forgetting that his little Alice was still in the room.

      She was going to ask him something when there was a bit of commotion in the hallway. 
Mariah, who&#39;d been treated for all her cuts, came bursting in, followed by some soldiers 
trying to restrain her. &quot;What&#39;s going on?! Why did so many people have to die?!&quot;

      Eric let out a sigh and motioned for the soldiers to let her go. &quot;To make it simple - 
there&#39;s a bad monster running around and it&#39;s been turning our test subjects into nasty 
things like what you just saw. Alice is our special weapon against that certain monster.&quot;

      He said it so plainly and Mariah looked over at Alice. &quot;Weapon?&quot;

      The little girl shrugged. &quot;I... don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about.&quot;

      Eric just grinned. &quot;Well, that&#39;s because I have a surprise for you!&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;The Demon Buster!&quot; He yelled triumphantly as he handed the new sword to Alice.

      The girl forced a smile. &quot;...Demon Buster...? What... a nice name.&quot;

      Mariah was still perturbed. &quot;So you&#39;re sending a little girl after something that a 
small militia can&#39;t even handle?&quot;

      Eric rooted around his desk. &quot;Yeah, but you can go with her if you want. Apparently 
you can do magic and such... here you go.&quot; He handed Mariah a small combat knife. &quot;I 
haven&#39;t named it yet, but it has the same effect as Alice&#39;s sword.&quot;

      The younger girl brightened up. &quot;Does it shoot laser beams?&quot;

      &quot;No - that would be the Laser Hybrid that won&#39;t be finished for a few more years,&quot; 
Eric said as Alice gawked at the thought of a sword that could do such a feat. &quot;But your 
Demon Buster is made of a special material meant to nullify any kind of malicious magic.&quot;

      &quot;Cool,&quot; the girl said, replacing her old sword with the new one.

      &quot;You didn&#39;t answer my question,&quot; Mariah suddenly interjected. &quot;I would... I would 
like to go with her to help her, but why is she chasing this monster?&quot;

      Eric scratched his head. &quot;Well, our little monster is specifically playing with 
Alice. To it, this is all a game. And the prize is killing her. Our soldiers can&#39;t track 
this monster down since it won&#39;t reveal itself to anyone but her. We have to use her as 
bait and we have to properly equip her to take it down.&quot; 

***** 

      &#39;Mariah insisted that she be with me, no matter what - she said that she couldn&#39;t let 
me go hunting demons alone.&#39;

      Eveon wanted to ask Miki questions so badly. Such as, where the hell was she when 
this was going on? And how about what the monster was? Just as soon as she thought that, 
Miki came out of the bathroom.

      &quot;I really wish I could ask you questions,&quot; Eveon murmured.

      Miki gave her a sheepish grin. &quot;Well, it would be much easier if you read it all and 
then I told you what happened to us at the end...&quot;

      &quot;You and Alice?&quot;

      The green eyed girl nodded. &quot;I&#39;m... going to go get some food from across the 
street.&quot;

      &quot;Instead of room service?&quot;

      &quot;Can&#39;t you tell it&#39;s extremely weird for me to be around while you&#39;re reading that?!&quot;
