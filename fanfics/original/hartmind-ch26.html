<a href="../original/hartmind-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>&quot;Have I told you this is crazy?&quot; Trish whispered from their spot behind 
a tree near Sam&#39;s old home. 

&quot;Several times.&quot; Sam stated with a sigh. Jasmine dropped them off soon 
after they made up their minds and drove down the street to a local 
convenience store, where she waited by a pay phone. They knew that Star 
was shot at around one o&#39;clock because that was when Sam&#39;s records state 
that her wounds appeared. The plan was that Trish and Sam were to stop 
Star before she entered the house and Jasmine would call the police at 
precisely one, telling them there has been a strange man seen sneaking 
around. 

As the two girls waited at their hiding place Sam spotted someone coming 
their way. At first she thought it was just one of the neighbours when 
she noticed the way the man kept glancing over his shoulder, then she 
got a clear view of his face and pulled Trish behind the tree, keeping 
low. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Trish curiously asked, laying on the ground next to her 
friend as she tried to squint through the branches of the large pine 
tree they decided to hide underneath, but could not see through the 
dense branches. 

&quot;Star&#39;s father.&quot; Sam breathed, trying to keep her heart from racing too 
fast. 

&quot;He&#39;s here?!?&quot; Trish squirmed over Sam to get a better hiding place, 
&quot;What are we going to do?&quot; She frightened asked. 

&quot;We wait.&quot; Sam stated, trying to keep calm and glanced down at her watch 
to see it was quarter past noon, &quot;She should be here soon enough.&quot;

Star skipped down the road as she talked to Sam in her mind, the two 
conversing about how they would finally get to meet in person. Her heart 
prepared to take as long as it took to meet face to face, and prepared 
to confront whatever met them head on. She smiled at the sound of Sam&#39;s 
voice and was suddenly startled to find the voice was not coming from 
inside her mind this time, but to her right. 

&quot;Star!!&quot; A strange girl called out as she raced across the street, a 
girl with Sam&#39;s voice. She had seen the girl several times in school and 
the way she looked at Star made her feel uneasy and she stepped away 
from the girl, and then she noticed another girl running along behind 
her, a girl she recognized at Sam&#39;s friend Trisha. The first girl called 
out again and Star was almost certain she was hearing Sam&#39;s voice. 

((Sam?)) She inquired internally, taking another cautious step away from 
the two girls, ((Sam, there are two strange girls here.)) She said 
worriedly. 

((Girls?)) Sam asked curiously, ((Who? Classmates maybe?))

Star shook her head, ((I think it is you...)) She stated, staring in 
disbelief at the girl before her as she slowed to a stop only a metre 
away, panting slightly. 

&quot;Star...&quot; The girl in front of her panted, &quot;You have to come with us.&quot; 
She stated urgently. 

Star glazed at the girl curiously, &quot;Who are you?&quot; She asked nervously, 
her eyes darting to Trish every now and then. The girl was very pretty 
in spite of her baggy shirt, torn jeans and the scar upon her forehead. 
Her eyes stopped on that scar and grew wide, ((Sam? Which side did you 
say your scar was on?)) 

((Over my right eye, near the hairline mostly.)) Sam replied, ((What is 
going on?)) 

&quot;Star it is me, Sam.&quot; The girl said as she reached out a hand towards 
the girl, &quot;I&#39;ve come to get you.&quot; 

Star glanced between the two girls uneasily, &quot;How can this be? How did 
you find me?&quot; She inquired frightfully. 

Sam held out her hand to the girl, &quot;It&#39;s me. You have to trust me.&quot; She 
glanced over her shoulder at Star&#39;s home and abruptly leapt at the girl, 
&quot;Get down!!!&quot; She cried out and suddenly the air shattered with the 
sound of a small explosion. The moment Sam&#39;s hands touched Beth her mind 
filled with a years worth of memories through Sam&#39;s eyes, from the day 
of her own demise to this very moment, it all flashed by in an instant, 
but as they landed upon the lawn she knew that her mind was just getting 
in sink with the future Sam and she felt their minds pass through each 
other for a moment as they rolled across the lawn. The two came to a 
stop on the grass, Star atop of Sam, and they smiled at each other. 

&quot;Sam???&quot; Star reached out to touch the girl&#39;s face, &quot;It is really you.&quot; 
She said with a giddy giggle, &quot;You really came looking for me.&quot; 

Sam hugged the girl, &quot;Of course I would, nothing would stop me from 
finding you.&quot; 

&quot;Leave that for later girls!!!&quot; Trish screamed as she pointed to the 
house and the front door as it opened and Star&#39;s father stepped out onto 
the lawn, a maddening look upon his face. 

&quot;I&#39;ll kill all of you.&quot; He insisted, aiming the gun at the girls, &quot;I 
don&#39;t care how many of you I have to go through, so just give me my 
daughter and I&#39;ll let you go.&quot; 

Trish quickly backed up while Sam rolled over into a crouched position, 
with Star behind her, her arms out spread to protect the girl, &quot;You 
can&#39;t have her.&quot; Sam snarled, &quot;She is mine and I&#39;ll never let you take 
her from me again.&quot; 

Several people came out of their houses to see what the commotion was 
about and stared in shock at the scene before them. The appearance of 
witness&#39;s made Star&#39;s father stagger backwards, turning the gun away 
from the girls to one of the neighbours at they approached. 

&quot;Don&#39;t come near me!!&quot; He shouted wildly, &quot;You have no idea what kind of 
monster she is.&quot; He stated, tears streaming down his face, &quot;She... she 
has to die. We are not safe with her alive.&quot; 

Sam suddenly lunged at the man, knocking his gun arm to the side and 
shoving him with all the force she could muster. A blast of air rushed 
around the girl, causing grass and leaves to pick up like a small 
cyclone and propelled the man backwards, forcing him into the brick wall 
of the house and knocking the gun from his hand. Not taking any chances 
she rushed towards the gun and dove at it. Again the winds around her 
picked up and the gun jumped into her fingers and she turned to point 
the gun at the man, who was bleeding from a cut upon his head. 

&quot;You - will - never - hurt - her - again.&quot; Sam breathed, stepping closer 
to the man, shakily pointing the gun at him, &quot;I&#39;ll never let you hurt 
her again.&quot; She seethed. 

Trish ran to Sam&#39;s side and wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s waist, 
&quot;Don&#39;t do it.&quot; She pleaded, &quot;You&#39;ll only be sent to jail and never be 
able to see Star again.&quot; She said, sobbing into the girl&#39;s back, &quot;Think 
of Star, think of me... I need you. Who am I going to talk to when Beth 
and I get into fights or if we want to get married? You can&#39;t do this. 
You can&#39;t!!!&quot; 

((Samantha...)) Star&#39;s voice echoed through Sam&#39;s mind and she quickly 
turned to see the girl standing where she left her, shaking her head, 
((Don&#39;t, you don&#39;t need to do this. We are together again.)) A smile 
spread across her face.

Sam glanced back at the man, who now cowards before the girl&#39;s fury. 
Finally she lowered the gun and a police officer, that she was not aware 
had arrived, quickly retrieved the gun while two others cuffed Star&#39;s 
father. Slowly Sam staggered over to Star and suddenly collapsed at the 
girl&#39;s feet. 

((Sam!?!)) Star called out in her mind as the girl dropped to her side 
and rolled the girl over, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; 

Sam smiled up at the girl, &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; She inquired. 

Star shook her head, &quot;No, I&#39;m fine.&quot; 

Sam&#39;s smile broadened, &quot;Good...&quot;
