6:30 am

 

Terra Tu was confused on two different levels. How could the team lose 
like that- and how could she be attracted to other girls when she knew 
full well she liked guys?

Kasumi Beckett felt dread. Losing that game had been her fault and she 
knew it. Their cold stares confirmed it.

Felicity Velur had anger and gratitude battling it out in her heart- 
anger at what her father would do, and how she would react; gratitude 
that Amy had given her an angel&#39;s smile and faintly brushed her hand 
against her shoulder, a comfort in hard times.

Fausta Nazario was disgusted at what happened- especially at her own 
failure.

Elisa Berkeley&#39;s mind wasn&#39;t even on the game they had lost yesterday. 
Nadia consumed her thoughts: her beautiful body, her come-hither eyes, 
her sweet smile, her deep intellect, her fun, her insight, her clarity. 
She wondered what it would be like to make love to such a creature.

Nadia Khovansky thought about cookies.

Amy Nguyen was overjoyed that she had broken one of her thickest 
barriers, that she had actually reached out to someone, and that- more 
importantly- they actually liked her. Now she was more determined than 
ever to break free from herself and broaden her horizons. Perhaps if she 
accidentally bumped into Felicity...

Freya von Hohenheim wondered how much time she had left.

Shannon Threal, who didn&#39;t have time to wait for everyone and so took 
the stall furthest from everyone else, was wary of Fleur, who she heard 
had seduced another member of her &quot;other&quot; team. Although she was sure 
Fleur wasn&#39;t the type to force herself onto anybody, and she could 
probably beat her senseless anyway, Shannon wanted to stay as far away 
from her as possible. But she was also reconsidering her view on 
homosexual people, thanks in no small part to her &quot;church friend&quot; 
Kasumi, and her roommate, of course.

Fleur Lacroix loved Priss as much as any morsel she had grown fat on.

Alice Hawthorne spared a glimpse at Lauren and saw happiness and 
acceptance in her eyes. None of the other girls paid her the slightest 
bit of attention. It was the best feeling in the world.

Lauren Ofdensen looked at Alice and instantly loved and accepted her. 
But still she wondered what Fausta would be like in bed- or anybody 
else, for that matter.

Valencia Durante was thinking about how she could cheer Kasumi up on 
their date later tonight.

Arina Essylt was wondering, for the millionth time, why her parents gave 
her that name, and where the deuce it came from, and why everyone 
assumed she was gay just because she hung around Lauren and was 
attracted to Fleur.

Rain Howlet couldn&#39;t help but wonder how all her fencing buddies were 
getting along without her.

Jennifer Andre wondered if Robin was really serious about all this, or 
just having fun like she did with so many other passing fancies. But 
more importantly, why did she even care?

All in all, very normal feelings for a group of young people, wouldn&#39;t 
you say?

 

In this wide world

People you&#39;re meant to meet can be seen

Beyond the window, beyond the rainbow

I think you&#39;re aware of them

Take off that restrictive weight

Let your feelings go

Now keep your ears open and wait for that time

Awaken now

Cherish the little dream you&#39;ve drawn in the vast sky

If you do, you can always become happy

It&#39;s certain, whoa whoa!

 

&quot;Boot Camp&quot;

 

Leena had her arms crossed and her legs firmly rooted on the ground, but 
her face was calm and her eyes were patient. &quot;There&#39;s no need for us to 
get into what happened yesterday. Losses come with the game; everybody 
loses eventually. It&#39;s what happens after you lose that determines the 
strength of the team. Now I said I&#39;d be switching our training- 
intensifying, you could say- but apparently that isn&#39;t working. From now 
on, ladies, the gloves come off and I hit you with everything I&#39;ve got. 
I&#39;m going to turn you from football players into Valkyries: swift, 
powerful, merciless, and fearless. From now on until the last day of the 
season, we&#39;re going to be training at least once a day, rain or shine, 
regardless of your schedules. If you&#39;ve got time to complain, you&#39;ve got 
time to run laps. Let&#39;s hustle now!&quot;

Everyone, even the bench-warmers, was expected to run for forty-five 
minutes straight, without pause. Leena shouted at them, telling them how 
to regulate their breathing, how to pump their legs, how to swing their 
arms, how to use the knees. She blew her whistle in a steady rhythm, 
forcing them to march or run with the beat. She made everyone run as 
fast as she could for as long as she could, and just as the very last 
one collapsed from weary lungs and aching legs, she had the staff bring 
out tires.

&quot;Break&#39;s over, ladies,&quot; she stated, towering over them menacingly. &quot;On 
your feet now. Essylt, that means you. Okay, everyone, through the 
tires! One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two! You&#39;re up next, Berkeley! 
One-two, one-two, one-two, one-two! Don&#39;t stop! Don&#39;t think- just do it! 
This isn&#39;t a classroom, it&#39;s a field! Lesser people have bled on the 
grass and stood up to fight again; don&#39;t disgrace yourselves. Durante, 
let&#39;s see some more speed! Those balls will come at you fast and hard! 
All right, Khovansky, that&#39;s the way to do it! You can do it, ladies- 
move those feet!&quot;

She gave them a breather, then had them do fifty push-ups and ten 
pull-ups to work on their upper body strength. When asked why, she told 
them, &quot;Don&#39;t think you can run around flailing those sissy arms of yours 
and win any games! You need good strong shoulders and arms to pump so 
you&#39;ve got a better balance. Don&#39;t strain yourself, Nguyen! This isn&#39;t a 
competition! Next are the medicine balls- catch and throw. Don&#39;t quit on 
me yet, Lacroix! You&#39;re gonna be doing this every day, so you&#39;d better 
get used to it!&quot;

Leena didn&#39;t give them time to complain or groan, and warned them that 
as soon as somebody raised an objection to her brutal methods, she would 
force them to quit their break and move on to even harder work. Everyone 
took her abuse silently after Terra let out an objectionable curse, and 
she proved how serious she was. She had them perform a hundred jumping 
jacks and wouldn&#39;t take fatigue for an answer. When the tribulation was 
over at last, she gave them another break, and smirked triumphantly as 
they sat, wheezing, in silence.

&quot;This is for your own good,&quot; she explained as she sat with them. &quot;Half 
the blame of yesterday&#39;s fiasco falls on my shoulders. I&#39;ve been 
coddling you all too much and giving the benefit of the doubt. I wasn&#39;t 
sure if you&#39;d continue to play seriously after we became a real team, so 
I slackened. But maybe, in a strange way, all this worked out. We never 
would&#39;ve woken up to the reality of the situation if we hadn&#39;t lost. 
We&#39;d still be on our high horse. There&#39;s nothing like humiliation to 
bring about humility. Once you&#39;ve rested, we&#39;ll go over to the gym for 
some cycling. I&#39;d like to integrate some swimming into our routine as 
well, so make sure you all have something decent you can work out in. 
You&#39;re all smart enough to know what I mean. This isn&#39;t Milan or 
anything.&quot; Fausta and Valencia turned red, since they felt so many eyes 
on them, but the rest looked eager to have a new twist to their routine.

 

- Elisa Berkeley, Hair/Eye color: dark brown; left midfielder/reserve-

 

Cycling is to riding a bike as a treadmill is to walking: they&#39;re just 
not the same. Cycling gives you a stationary bike that anybody can ride, 
without the curves and contours of a road to offer any challenge. Leena 
didn&#39;t use the treadmills because she wanted the team to practice on 
real turf, but she knew that not everybody had bicycles, or even knew 
how to ride one, so this was the best alternative. As Kasumi could 
attest, riding a bike was an excellent way to strengthen the leg 
muscles. Not everyone was used to it, though, so Leena went slow. Fleur 
was just about to mention that she would NOT start growing big ugly 
muscles, but then reconsidered. More than likely, Leena would just force 
everyone to go another kilometer or two, and while she didn&#39;t care about 
anybody else, the strain on her own body would be too much.

After break, she had them climb a rock wall and go through an obstacle 
course the staff had set up earlier. Rosewood had contributed several 
ideas borrowed from her days in the military, and now Leena was using 
them to shape her team into a force to be reckoned with. They crawled 
under low bars, vaulted over walls, swung on ropes, and teetered on a 
beam. Leena gave each of them a wheelbarrow laden with heavy blocks and 
forced them to run a mile with them, then finished with a relay race.

&quot;We&#39;re going to train until you can do this in your sleep,&quot; she barked. 
&quot;When you wake up in the morning, your mind will already be focused on 
your next session. You will sacrifice everything that means something to 
you so that you can come out here before the sun is up to run around in 
the mud. You will freeze and you will not care. You will bleed but you 
will never cry. You will train until you are broken and rebuilt. You 
will emerge from the fire a sharp sword that can pierce through 
anything. And tomorrow will be even more intense than today.&quot;

She asked everyone to start integrating their own unique talents into 
the team as a whole. Leena had Terra and Amy teach everyone martial 
arts. Lauren showed them how to stay so focused on the ball that your 
body naturally moves in synch with it, how to jerk from side to side, 
how to catch and throw, and how to jump. Kasumi and Felicity showed them 
the finer points of handling the ball: how to hold it and angle it so it 
would go exactly where you wanted it; how to knock it with your head and 
your chest; how to dribble it on the feet, thighs, and knees; how to 
shoot it far across the field, and tap into the goal. Fausta and Shannon 
gave them aggression, how to hit hard and slide to steal the ball, how 
to intercept and pick out the weakest and strongest players. Nadia 
showed them how to move like a marathon runner, how to control the 
breath and the muscles so you could keep going when everyone else was 
breathless. Freya went over &quot;battle tactics&quot; and made everyone memorize 
a few surprise maneuvers. Fleur told them what to eat in order to 
produce very specific results; Elisa gave them the art of 
unpredictability; Valencia showed how use of geometry could help 
determine where exactly the ball would go. Rain drilled them in fencing 
maneuvers; Arina taught them how to get into players&#39; heads; Jennifer 
showed them how to be nimble and weave their way through the opponents.

&quot;I don&#39;t have anything to give you,&quot; Alice sighed as she laid on the 
ground. &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing. Everyone&#39;s special but me.&quot;

&quot;Well then, try and integrate all of these skills, so that we can rely 
on you for anything at any time,&quot; Leena offered. Alice turned red but 
devoted herself to this ideal. By the time Thursday came around, the 
ladies had underwent a drastic change, and yet there was so much more 
they needed to learn before their next game.

&quot;Before your heads get too big,&quot; Leena shouted as the brutality began to 
wear off and results started to show, &quot;you have to be aware that all the 
other teams are going through this exact same regiment. Remember! No 
matter how hard you train, how long you stay out here, or how much you 
want to win, the other team will always train twice as much, stay out 
twice as long, and want it more than you ever will. Always train for 
preparation against a superior force! Better to overestimate the 
opponent than underestimate them! Remember how Anolis and Carnegie felt 
about you? Now remember how Carlisle felt?! Don&#39;t forget!! They&#39;re 
always going to be reaching higher than you! What do you do, then, when 
the other team is superior in every way? What are you left with? You can 
either fall down in defeat or stand up in defiance!!

&quot;That&#39;ll do for today. Hit the showers. Tomorrow&#39;s going to be even 
worse.&quot;

The training was so unforgiving that nobody even had time to glance 
around as they undressed, showered, put their normal clothes on, and 
went home to crash on their beds in a sleep that came as fast as the 
darkness in winter or school after a summer&#39;s end.

 

- Fausta Nazario, Hair/eye color: black/blue, sweeper-

 

Batter my heart, that I may rise, and stand,

O&#39;erthrow me, and bend Your force,

To break, blow, burn and make me new...

Take me to You, imprison me, for I

Except You enthrall me, never shall be free,

Nor ever chaste, except You ravish me.

 

&quot;The day has finally arrived,&quot; Leena said as the team broke the circle. 
&quot;The day in which all of your hard work starts to pay off. I realize I 
may have been asking too much of you over this past week, and in the 
future, I&#39;ll ask for even more. But I want us all to be serious about 
the time we spend here. I want us all to be certain of what we came here 
to do. If you&#39;re truly devoted to this team, you&#39;ll understand why I did 
what I felt was the right thing to do. I don&#39;t expect you to like it; I 
just want you to trust me. We&#39;ll be up against Vale Private Women&#39;s 
College today, and from what I hear, they&#39;re a lot better than Carlisle. 
Let&#39;s show them that we&#39;re serious about this. Good game out there.&quot;

The ladies were given a few hours off to meditate on what they had been 
through, what they were going up against, and what they had to do in 
order to redeem themselves. The game against Carlisle was a disaster, 
proof that pride does indeed come before the fall, kindling for 
Fitzgerald to use for his argument against the team&#39;s competence, and a 
blow to Rosewood&#39;s faith. It was worse than the loss against Anolis: at 
least back then, they had been beaten by a far superior team. Now that 
they were more experienced and were closer as a team, there were no more 
excuses.

&quot;I wonder if the Coach&#39;ll let us have tomorrow off,&quot; Valencia said as 
she headed back to her car, Kasumi by her side. There was enough time 
before the game started to have a light breakfast, and thank goodness 
she knew of plenty of places that were open this early. She winced 
playfully and said, &quot;Lord knows we need it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been 
more tired. I envy you, Kasumi. You must be used to this sort of 
torture.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; she grumbled. She smiled coolly and slipped her hand into 
Valencia&#39;s, entwining their fingers, getting a pleasant little shock 
from the contact of her silky skin. She hated having such rough paws; 
they must feel like tree bark. &quot;I&#39;ve been on a few teams, but they were 
mostly grade-school level. I sort of slipped out of it in my later 
years, and tried to put more focus on just getting into school and 
keeping my job. I tell ya, some of these old muscles, they don&#39;t feel 
too well after a couple of years in atrophy.&quot;

&quot;Well, you always look marvelous out there,&quot; she said, eyes shimmering. 
&quot;You make it look so easy. I have to struggle just so I don&#39;t make 
myself look like an idiot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s harder than it looks. So,&quot; she said, changing the course of their 
conversation, &quot;if Leena does give us this Sunday off, are we 
rescheduling our date?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered, turning a little red. Valencia had not been on a 
date in over a year, and she had never gone out with a girl- especially 
not one as beautiful, tough, and exciting as Kasumi.

&quot;Where, uh, would you like to go?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s this new Spanish restaurant that just opened called La Pasion. 
I&#39;ve been dying to go there ever since I first heard about it.&quot;

&quot;All right, that sounds good.&quot; Valencia became a little sheepish as 
Kasumi smiled at her.

&quot;The only thing is, though, uh...you kind of have to make reservations, 
and...there&#39;s sort of a dress code.&quot; Kasumi&#39;s eyes flickered in 
surprise.

&quot;Oh, so it&#39;s that kind of restaurant.&quot;

&quot;Uh, yeah. But getting in shouldn&#39;t be a problem for me. Do you have 
like an evening gown you could take with you?&quot;

&quot;Valencia, look at me,&quot; she sighed, rubbing her neck as she parted her 
long black hair. &quot;I grew up in the slums of DC and I spent most of my 
time getting into and out of fights, whenever I wasn&#39;t getting 
scraped-up on the field or goosed by some horny bisexual guy. There&#39;s no 
&#39;Sunday finest&#39; in my wardrobe.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; she sighed, smiling remorsefully. &quot;Don&#39;t take this the wrong 
way, carino, but you&#39;ve just made me a very happy person. That means we 
get to go shopping together!&quot;

&quot;Oh hell no!&quot; she shouted, her face turning red. &quot;I ain&#39;t hangin&#39; around 
no girly boutique, and I sure as hell ain&#39;t modeling in no prissy 
uniform!&quot; The significance of what she was saying hit her a split second 
later, like a slap to the face, and she recoiled shamefully. &quot;Oh shit, 
what am I saying? Val, I...I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just a reflexive reaction. 
Look, I don&#39;t mean to be a stereotype, but that&#39;s really not my thing. 
But, uh, if it really means that much to you, ya know, I&#39;ll go through 
with it. I mean, I guess I do need to have something nice in my closet. 
Um...I mean, you know.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so cute,&quot; she giggled, not taking any offense. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about it. People who put up the biggest defenses are the most fun to 
shop with, after all. I promise we&#39;ll take a look at the flannel and 
leather department once we&#39;re finished.&quot;

&quot;I told you I&#39;m not a stereotype!&quot; she blurted, blushing deeper. 
Valencia laughed and kissed her cheek to soothe her. They stopped by the 
Lily Club for a bite to eat and slipped in and out of small-talk. 
Valencia did most of the chatting, though: Kasumi just liked to listen 
to her silky Spanish accent. Sometime in the near future, she was going 
to arrange a meeting between her mentor, Adrien F&eacute;lix, and Maria 
Maethers; she and Freya would be attending as mediators. Valencia didn&#39;t 
expect Kasumi to know who Adrien F&eacute;lix was, so while they were eating, 
she explained that he was a renowned designer in France she had met when 
she was fourteen, and because of her outspoken opinions, he had employed 
her and the two grew to be very close, so much so that she thought of 
him as a second father.

&quot;Outspoken opinions?&quot; Kasumi said. Valencia smiled bashfully.

&quot;Yeah. When I first met him, I was looking at his designs on display, 
and he just happened to get into a heated discussion with me. He was 
impressed with my fashion knowledge, and decided to give me a job. I was 
fourteen at the time, and four years later, I became his assistant. He 
more or less got me started on this road. Apparently, he thought sports 
would be good for me, just like he thought acting and modeling would be 
good. Those didn&#39;t work out very well.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, wait a minute! You&#39;ve acted and modeled before?&quot;

&quot;Nothing big, just a few little stints here and there. I guess I had 
some potential, but...ah, I don&#39;t know. I was never very motivated. I 
don&#39;t even think I&#39;m cut out for soccer. I just want to design and make 
clothes, you know?&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; she murmured, impressed. &quot;I never knew. Um, well, all the same, I 
hope you stay with us. You&#39;re an excellent goalie.&quot;

&quot;I suck,&quot; she laughed sadly. &quot;Jefe said the same thing about my acting 
and modeling career. Ha! Can you imagine? There are all these things I&#39;m 
good at, but I don&#39;t really care about any of them, except one. My 
future&#39;s like a giant quilt, and all I want is a little square.&quot;

&quot;At least stay for the rest of the season,&quot; Kasumi murmured, covering 
her hand again. &quot;You may not realize it, but some of us depend on you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want people to depend on me. That would be horrible. Just look 
at our games. You put all your hopes on me, and when I fail- &quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; she implored, soft but strong. &quot;Put that out of your mind. 
Nobody&#39;s going to hate you if you slip up. And...even if they do, I 
never will. I&#39;m going to count on you and believe in you no matter what. 
Ah...sorry, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m saying. I&#39;ve never had a girlfriend 
before. I haven&#39;t scared you away, have I?&quot; Valencia laughed and 
caressed her dear sweet fragile face.

&quot;You know, for a tough girl from the ghetto, you sure are sensitive. 
Come on, carino, eat up. We both have a lot of high expectations set on 
us.&quot; She kissed Kasumi on the lips and grinned. They both felt a little 
better afterward.

 

- Felicity Velur, Hair/eye color: brown/azure blue, forward-

 

What am I doing here, Valencia wondered to herself as she put her cleats 
on and adjusted her keeper&#39;s mitts. It was almost time to go out and 
everyone was in the process of putting their game faces on. Valencia&#39;s 
heart was throbbing as she continued to wrestle with herself and her 
doubts. Talking with Kasumi had unearthed a whole mess of conflicting 
emotions and ideas that she was probably better off without, 
particularly since so many eyes would be watching them today. 
Expectations had been no doubt lowered by their dismal premier a week 
ago, so once again, the young team had something to prove.

That&#39;s a bad question to ask yourself now, Val, she admonished as she 
took several calming breaths. But she couldn&#39;t sweep it away; it 
continued to pester her even as Leena came forth for some last minute 
advice. Her words became muffled and lost as Valencia&#39;s thoughts turned 
inward, and she became uncomfortable. Darn it, why do they have to rely 
on me? I should just quit and focus on my career! I was never meant to 
play sports! Jefe knew that! Mom and dad knew that! Marina knew that! 
The only people that seemed to think otherwise were...

It was Leena and Kasumi. But not just them! It&#39;s time to be fair, Val: 
at least half the team thinks you&#39;ve got something here. Even Lauren 
thinks I&#39;m good at it. But it&#39;s not what I want to do! I know that 
people are supporting me- that Jefe and my family are supporting me even 
if they don&#39;t think I was meant for this- but they&#39;re supporting 
something I&#39;m not sure I should be pursuing! If I told them what I 
really wanted to do, and quit on them, would they still like me? Would I 
be letting them down, or would they even care? Why am I even here? Why 
did I agree to this? I can still do everything I&#39;m doing without 
futebal, can&#39;t I? I can go out with Kasumi, be with my friends, go to 
school, and follow my dreams. Why am I still here?

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; She heard Amy calling out to her, and suddenly realized 
that everyone else had left the locker room for the field. She felt 
awful and wanted to throw everything away right then and there, and 
march away, never looking back. After all, wasn&#39;t she just wasting her 
time? But then Valencia had an epiphany: why was anybody still there? 
Did any of them seriously want to do this for the rest of their lives? 
Of course not. Even hardcore players like Kasumi, Shannon, and Felicity 
would go on to do other things. One or two might be lucky enough to go 
pro, and perhaps sponsor a few endorsements, but the others would no 
doubt find wider horizons after they got their degrees. &quot;Sports&quot; was not 
a major that they could take and get a certificate in; it was just 
another experience that added something to life so that it was worth 
living a little more. Valencia was not here because she was going to 
make something significant out of it: she was here simply for the 
experience, so she could look back on it one day, children and 
grandchildren surrounding her, and say with pride that she did it.

She took a deep breath and rubbed her face. She gave Amy a hug for 
indirectly showing her the way. &quot;Yeah, just a little nervous. It&#39;s okay, 
I&#39;m over it now. I&#39;m ready.&quot;

&quot;Oh, g-good,&quot; she smiled. &quot;W-w-we&#39;ll be count-t-ting on you tod-d-day.&quot;

&quot;I know. I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

 

&quot;Well, folks, this game has been all about Carnegie from the opening 
moments. They came onto the field as strong and confident as ever, and 
after shaking the dust of Carlisle off their shoes, they&#39;ve proven 
themselves worthy of respect. Vale&#39;s been having lots of trouble 
penetrating their defenses as of late, but they&#39;ve managed one goal so 
far. Carnegie&#39;s offense is pounding them with shot after shot, though, 
and they&#39;ve made Vale pay dearly for every advance. With halftime over, 
the score 2-1, and the end of the second half drawing closer with every 
minute, you have to wonder if Vale has any tricks left up their sleeves.

&quot;Wagner comes down the field, passes to Voleski...Voleski makes a shot, 
it&#39;s caught by Howlet, Howlet drives down...no, wait! She&#39;s lost the 
ball and now Shiratori is heading right into enemy territory! She&#39;s got 
Mouse and Morgan on her heels, ready to pick up the slack... Nguyen and 
Hawthorne go after her- whoops, Shiratori gets away! Now further down to 
Threal and Nazario... Ladies and gentlemen, this is the first serious 
attack against Carnegie&#39;s defenses I&#39;ve seen Vale attempt, but I don&#39;t 
know what they expect to accomplish with time and the score running 
against them. They&#39;re going straight for the goal...Threal intercepts 
but Shiratori is relentless; she&#39;s passing to Mouse, Mouse takes it down 
and- whoa, stopped by Nazario, and- no, wait! Morgan&#39;s got it and she&#39;s 
going strong! Now back to Shiratori! It seems like this offensive is all 
about Hikaru Shiratori today... She&#39;s going for the goal... Durante 
didn&#39;t fare too well in the last game, so you have to wonder if Vale&#39;s 
going to score...&quot;

What am I here for? What am I doing? Jefe, why did you push me here?

&quot;WHOA, what a shot! Looks like they just sealed the deal! I don&#39;t think 
Durante can get this in time!&quot;

No...I can&#39;t blame him. If I really wanted to, I could have refused his 
offer and continued my dreams. If I honestly didn&#39;t want to be here, I 
would not have signed up. So WHY? Why did I do it?

&quot;IT LOOKS LIKE VALE&#39;S GOING TO TIE THE GAME!!&quot;

I know now. I know why I came. I know why I&#39;m here. I know why I can 
never quit. The reason is so simple. It&#39;s been right there all along.

Because they NEED me.

&quot;OH MY GOD, SHE CAUGHT IT! Valencia Durante caught it! Carnegie wins, 
2-1! What a fantastic comeback! Carnegie wins!!&quot;

And I need them. Thank you, Amy. Thank you, Kasumi. Thank you, Leena. 
Thank you, Jefe. I have a new dream now. And for once I&#39;m going to 
follow it.

midfielder-

 

&quot;You all did very well today,&quot; Leena announced warmly. &quot;You came back 
and proved to everyone that you still have something to fight for. By 
now you know that all your hard work really does pay off- but that&#39;s no 
reason to get lazy! In fact, just so that you don&#39;t ever forget, from 
now on, I&#39;m implementing an even more rigorous schedule for you all! 
Prepare for the Intensive Training Session from Hell!&quot;

&quot;Oh, dios mia!&quot; Valencia groaned as she deflated on the floor. &quot;Saints 
preserve me, I should&#39;ve quit when I had the chance!&quot;
