<h1>All Girls School (part 43 of 109)</h1>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch42.html">Back to Part 42</a><pre>Sarah Johansson stirred and tossed before suddenly waking. Her eyes hurt 
from being closed too long, so with great effort, she pried their rusty 
lids open. Her radio alarm, playing very loud choral music (from the 
late 1300s, she believed), woke her up and gave her just the lift she 
needed to sigh, wallow in her sheets, and bump into the naked body next 
to her. She groaned and kissed the person&#39;s cheek until they woke.

&quot;Morning. School starts in two hours if you care.&quot; She yawned like a 
lioness, nearly tempted to slump back down on the downy pillow of her 
recent lover&#39;s chest. Said lover grunted, woke, and rubbed their eyes.

&quot;Ugh... we slept together. Jackie&#39;s gonna kill me for this.&quot;

&quot;I thought you two weren&#39;t on speaking terms anymore.&quot;

&quot;Just as professionals.&quot; They both yawned. Sarah sighed and fiddled with 
her new lover&#39;s curly black hair.

&quot;You still love her?&quot;

&quot;I guess.&quot;

&quot;Then why&#39;d you sleep with me?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. I guess I needed sex.&quot; Sarah laughed quietly.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to repute myself as the person people go to when they need 
sex. And you should know better... Miss McGowen.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so sue me. Are those our clothes there in that pile?&quot; Sarah leaned 
over the bed, naked save for her sheets, and exposed quite a bit of her 
bare back to her lover. She laughed as she saw just how disheveled their 
apparel had gotten.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; she answered.

Nobody knows

Just why we&#39;re here

Could it be fate

Or random circumstance

At the right place

At the right time

Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired

To meld our lives

To make us

Fuel and fire

Then know

Where ever you will be

So too shall I be

Close your eyes

Dry your tears

&#39;Coz when nothing seems clear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Weary heart

You&#39;ll be safe here

Remember how we laughed

Until we cried

At the most stupid things

Like we were so high

But love was all that we were on

We belong

And though the world would

Never understand

This unlikely union

And why it still stands

Someday we will be set free.

Pray and believe

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

Save your eyes

From your tears

When everything&#39;s unclear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Wounded heart

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

In my arms

Through the long cold night
Sleep tight

You&#39;ll be safe here

When no one understands

I&#39;ll believe

You&#39;ll be safe,

You&#39;ll be safe

You&#39;ll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands

You&#39;ll be safe here

&quot;L84AD8&quot;

Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon yawned in Ms. Keeping&#39;s psychology class. Homecoming 
was just a few days away, and after that, a glorious three-day weekend, 
but here she was, Tuesday in and failing art (of all things), bored from 
hearing about Pavlovian theory and Freudian slips, sleepy and distorted, 
yearning to be free so she could see Lilian again, or at least so she 
could tease Blake or congratulate Janine. She rubbed her face and tried 
to concentrate, but to no avail. Ms. Keeping was beautiful and smart, 
but sometimes she could be so bloody boring (although seeing her acting 
chipper on Monday was fun, but for what reason, nobody could say).

If Gabrielle was bored, Erica Fox was disappointed. Amina had crushed 
her hopes for a relationship not long ago, saying that she preferred to 
be friends, that even if she was interested in girls, Erica was just not 
her type. Fox didn&#39;t take the news merrily, of course, but since she had 
never really done anything deeply intimate with Amina, there really 
wasn&#39;t anything to be bothered about. Washim was a friend, all right, 
and quite a nice one too, and so was Nomi. And Joss, who would soon be 
showing her pregnancy. And Kula, wild like her sister and cute like, 
well, the kind of girls she liked.

Ah, Nomi. There was a different story. Nomi had split with Erica&#39;s older 
sister Alisha over the weekend. Their romance was brief but hardly 
fiery; in fact, the main cause of the rift had been Alisha&#39;s roaming 
hands, flirty eyes, and snuffling face. Nomi liked Alisha but wanted to 
take her relationships slow. Alisha had been practically whining about 
sex. Nomi had gotten tired of it and said that the poor woman could only 
be friends with her, or maybe mates in a band. Alisha took the news 
really badly, but fortunately, Erica had not been around to absorb her 
anger. That did not stop her from thinking her sister deserved a little 
rejection.

Jocelyn... was a unique case. And Erica did not have the extra capacity 
for thought to use on contemplating said case. Her work came first, at 
least now it did, and she wanted to keep her good grades (partially, 
yes, to show up her sister). Kula was also another unique case&#151;the young 
transfer student had not been there a few days and had already asked 
Erica out on a date! She was just as bad as Alisha! Fox was more 
cautious than flattered, and gave a polite thanks-but-no-thanks. She 
feared Kula would retaliate violently, but fortunately the Hawaiian girl 
shrugged it off with a &quot;Meh&quot;.

She was not so kind to Usha. Erica was indifferent towards the older 
girl, and while sometimes Usha could be annoying and stuck-up, she 
didn&#39;t deserve half the bullying Kula gave her. Erica had wanted to 
defend Usha, actually, but usually one the girl&#39;s friends or two 
girlfriends beat her. Besides, Usha was capable of defending herself.

&quot;Yes, Miss Fox?&quot; Keeping called on her, and she took a breath to clear 
her thoughts.

&quot;Jung&#39;s views on introversion and extroversion were written in 
Psychological Types, 1921.&quot;

&quot;Good. Can anybody give me examples of each?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, me,&quot; said Hero Love, grinning. Even Keeping knew what she meant.

&quot;Well, yes, you&#39;re certainly extroverted. Any others?&quot;

&quot;Myself,&quot; said Usha.

&quot;And your mama,&quot; muttered Kula. Keeping gave the girl a sharp stare.

&quot;Miss Nanahara, your new-student status means nothing to me. You&#39;re 
fifteen years old and ought to know how to behave in a civil manner. You 
will be assigned extra homework for your outburst.&quot;

&quot;What? But&#151;&quot;

&quot;If you prefer more, Miss Nanahara, by all means...&quot; Keeping motioned to 
her, nearly daring her to talk. Kula sighed and gave an understanding 
nod. If she had any redeeming traits, Kula knew how and when to 
apologize.

&quot;No, ma&#39;am. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Will you apologize to Usha?&quot; Kula made a sour face, but relented. She 
turned and said very smarmily, &quot;I&#39;m very sorry, Miss Usha Krishnan.&quot;

&quot;Kula.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;I really am. Forgive me?&quot; Usha sighed.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; said the teacher. &quot;Let&#39;s continue, shall we? Who can tell me 
some of...&quot; Kula tuned her teacher out and crossed her arms. She glared 
at Usha out of the corner of her eye, mentally picturing the woman in 
pain.

Yeah, I&#39;m sorry, all right. Sorry I gotta be on the same planet as you.

......

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if they got together?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but that&#39;s fantasy.&quot;

&quot;I think it could work.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you oughta join them.&quot;

&quot;Nah, I&#39;m not into threesomes.&quot;

&quot;Hey Zane!&quot;

&quot;Yo, Vick! My girl!&quot; Aintzane Klein and Victoria Grissom, now studying 
each other, met and embraced. She gave Alexis Walker a nod and spoke 
again to Zane.

&quot;I heard about your play, Zane. I&#39;m really happy it got accepted.&quot; She 
shrugged modestly.

&quot;Eh. I hear Post didn&#39;t get nearly as many as she expected or wanted, so 
she finally gave up hope and just picked from the ones she had. I guess 
if there were only a few other scripts for her to choose from, mine 
stood a pretty good chance. Hey, I hear Gab got hers picked as well. Uh, 
what&#39;s the one...?&quot;

&quot;The one where rival pirates fall in love,&quot; said X.

&quot;Oh yeah! Hey, pretty cool. I&#39;m dressing as a pirate for Halloween.&quot;

&quot;You are?&quot; Victoria looked at Zane, who grinned, covered her eye with 
her hand, and let out a mighty &quot;Arr!&quot; Victoria giggled.

&quot;What about you, Vick?&quot;

&quot;Um... June and I are thinking of going as Subaru and Tsukasa from dot 
hack.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really? That sounds cute. I hear you two are an item.&quot; Victoria 
blushed and combed back her red hair, revealing more of her smile.

&quot;Uh, yeah, we are. We are. It&#39;s good. She&#39;s older than me, but otherwise 
just my type.&quot;

&quot;So like, how do you two... you know... cuz&#39; she&#39;s in a wheelchair.&quot;

&quot;We manage.&quot; A thought just occurred to Grissom that maybe, what she had 
thought Zane meant and what Zane really meant were two different things, 
and she blushed and started blurting. &quot;Ohgod, I didn&#39;t mean it like 
that! Uh, um, you know, uh, it&#39;s not like we sleep together or anything! 
I mean, we don&#39;t! Um, uh, I mean, I&#39;ve been over to her house and I&#39;ve 
seen her undress&#151;I mean, I watched her change&#151;I mean, I accidentally saw 
her slip something off&#151;I mean... oh, god...&quot;

Walker and Klein laughed and slapped poor Vicki on the back, nearly 
knocking the smallish girl over.

&quot;Eh, it&#39;s okay. You know, you&#39;re really cute when you stutter.&quot;

&quot;Oh, god!!&quot;

&quot;Quiet now,&quot; said X seriously. She petted Vicki&#39;s hair and said, &quot;It&#39;s 
obvious she&#39;s flustered and doesn&#39;t know what she&#39;s saying. Vick, 
whenever you find yourself in that situation, try not to panic. You have 
a bad habit of doing that.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; she squeaked. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just... when I get embarrassed, 
I say all kinds of things and hope the right thing comes out and saves 
my behind. I just end up in more trouble.&quot; Zane and X said &quot;Aww&quot;, and 
hugged her from two sides. Vicki let out a helpless squeak as she was 
crushed by the older, taller girls, but was saved by a sharp &quot;A-hem!&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; They waved at the source. &quot;Hey June. Lovely day.&quot;

&quot;Kindly stop smothering my girlfriend,&quot; she said. The two jocks chuckled 
nervously and let Vicki breathe. Once freed, she burst out, gasped, and 
thanked June. Tramble wheeled over and took her hand, eyes sparkling as 
she asked, very sweetly, if Victoria was all right. Victoria answered, 
in a very romantic voice, that she was indeed safe, and glad for her 
concern. They shared a warm, tender smile, and a kiss that would&#39;ve been 
very nice if the two girls who had been pestering poor Grissom had not 
left&#151;or whistled loudly.

&quot;Grow up,&quot; murmured June as she rolled her eyes. Vicki waved farewell to 
them both as she pushed her girlfriend&#39;s wheelchair down the hall to 
their next class. Zane and X stood still for awhile.

&quot;That was good.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Hey, uh, Zane?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;You got any plans for Homecoming?&quot;

&quot;You mean... am I going with anybody, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, if you wanna put it that way.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t have anybody. I&#39;ll go, but man... it&#39;ll be lonely as hell 
there. I always did hate going to big social places by myself. Why, you 
offering?&quot;

&quot;Sure, if you like. I mean, I got nowhere else to go and nobody to go 
with me either. We may as well help each other out.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure. Why not? Hey, X?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Does this make us a couple?&quot;

&quot;If you want.&quot; Zane thought about it&#151;for about two seconds.

&quot;Meh... sure, I guess.&quot;

&quot;All right. Fine by me.&quot;

&quot;Cool.&quot; They quietly walked side by side for a few minutes, passing by 
one of the restrooms that randomly lined the halls of Stanton. They 
paused and looked at their settings casually.

&quot;Wanna fuck?&quot; asked Walker nonchalantly. Zane&#39;s reply was just as 
compliant.

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot; The girls walked through the bathroom door, and to describe 
anything that happened afterwards would&#39;ve been an exercise in futility.

.........

Finally! School let out and Gabrielle was free! She had just enough time 
to drive home, shower, and get ready for her date. Lilian asked to meet 
her in a place called the Arboretum, a large outdoors facility used 
mostly by joggers and naturalists. It was pretty close to the local 
university, and although Gabrielle had been there before with her 
friends, it had been a long time since she went, so she had to ask her 
girlfriend for directions.

Her girlfriend. It brought shivers of warmth to think of her. Lilian. 
Such a beautiful name&#151;such a beautiful person. After so many failed 
attempts, heartbreaks, and disappointments, Gabrielle finally believed 
she had found a woman just right for her: older, more mature, calm, 
smart, generous, and lovely. Wendy, her very first girlfriend, was cute 
but hardly reliable; Patricia had been attentive but also obsessive; and 
Ayanna was nice, but seemed interested in something else, and besides, 
she was related to Olivia. Lilian was reliable, patient, and plainly 
interested in Gabrielle, and she also had every other good trait her 
three previous loves bore&#151;and more.

When she got home and started to sprint around the house, her parents 
asked her (once she was out of the shower and scrambling to get 
dressed), &quot;And where are you off too in such a rush, young lady?&quot;

&quot;Gotta date,&quot; she answered, applying lipstick. Her father poked his head 
in her room.

&quot;With Ayanna?&quot;

&quot;No, dada, we broke up. I&#39;m going with Lilian now.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that was quick.&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#39;t Lilian that girl you brought over early in the school year?&quot; 
asked her mother. &quot;The, uh, the pale girl from Germany?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s the one.&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; said her mother, tapping her husband on the stomach. &quot;I told you 
she liked her.&quot;

&quot;I believed you. I just gave my girls the benefit of the doubt. But that 
was awfully quick work, Gab.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, such is the life of a teenager. Mama, ya seen me comb?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s in the bathroom, as always.&quot; Her parents gave each other a look of 
defeat as their daughter scrambled around, desperate to do as many 
things as possible in the shortest period of time. She looked awfully 
silly, too, but her parents figured it was the love bug&#39;s infectious 
bite.

&quot;So where will you be going?&quot;

&quot;The Arboretum.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that&#39;s nice. How long do you expect to be there?&quot;

&quot;A few hours.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ll be back when?&quot;

&quot;Before eleven, ma.&quot; She knew the drill.

Since Gabrielle could drive herself, she jetted off alone, leaving her 
parents with a farewell and a blown kiss. She began to panic as she 
drove and faced what seemed to be every red light from there to the 
university. She cursed mildly at her horrible luck. An ambulance 
screamed past and delayed her, but then an idea came to her. She changed 
lanes and drove behind the flashing vehicle, knowing it would clear a 
path for her. Her quick thinking worked, and she made good time. She 
arrived at the parking lot early, laughably early, and frowned with 
embarrassment.

&quot;I&#39;m way too strung up for this,&quot; she sighed. Gabrielle got out of her 
car and waited, searching for Lilian. Odds were that she would also 
drive herself, and that she would be carrying a parasol and dark shades, 
maybe even a straw hat. Gabrielle&#39;s stomach careened around like a mad 
ambulance while she waited. She eventually walked over to the grass and 
plucked a few blades to stick in her teeth.

Lilian&#39;s car drove in ten minutes later, still early, flagged in by 
Gabrielle&#39;s waving hand. As she expected, Nachtheim emerged with a large 
blue umbrella, sunglasses, and even (she squealed with glee) a cute 
straw hat. Gabrielle hugged her, forcing her to drop the umbrella. 
Lilian gave a jerk, but laughed and returned the hug. She blushed as 
Gabrielle stroked her pale face.

&quot;Wow, ya look so cute! How long have ya had that hat?&quot;

&quot;Mm, since I was very young. I like it.&quot;

&quot;Me too. Where can I get one?&quot;

&quot;Would you like to have mine?&quot; Gabrielle grinned warmly. Truly, Lilian 
was a very giving woman; she would&#39;ve given anyone anything if she felt 
they needed it.

&quot;Oh no, I couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;You sure? I don&#39;t mind. It would make a nice present.&quot; O&#39;Shannon&#39;s 
cheeks glowed merrily, but she refused all the same. She linked arms 
with her girlfriend, now sharing the umbrella, and walked with her to 
the path that wound around the large open space. Even though it was 
mid-October, people were still out playing, enjoying the last shreds of 
warm weather before the cold truly began to settle in. The day was 
perfect for walking and enjoying the scenery: trees erupted with 
volcanic color, each turning brown, orange, red, or gold; some staying 
green, green forever, lashing their flavor in with the taste of autumn; 
it reminded Gabrielle heavily of Blake Baum, who would&#39;ve gone 
camouflaged in the autumnal season.

&quot;Wonderful day,&quot; she said. Lilian hummed. Gabrielle liked that she was 
not big on talking&#151;after all, talk was cheap and silence was golden&#151;and 
so it was nice to just be with someone in serenity. She stuffed her 
hands in her pockets, trying to think of something to say once she had 
her fill of peace.

&quot;Not much to talk about,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We covered most everything in 
Miss Madsen&#39;s class.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. Not too much else to say. We already know each other well.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Hey, um... when&#39;s your birthday? You never told me that.&quot;

&quot;January 10th.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so you don&#39;t have too much longer to wait, huh? Let&#39;s see... mine 
is March 23rd, about a week after St. Patrick&#39;s. You&#39;ll be... eighteen, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, and you&#39;ll be seventeen.&quot;

&quot;Gosh,&quot; whispered Gabrielle after awhile. She looked over and gave her 
girlfriend a smile. &quot;We&#39;re not that far apart in age, about... a year, a 
year and two months. I hope ya don&#39;t mind hangin&#39; around with a lil&#39; kid 
like me!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Lilian grinning, &quot;I like it. I like you a lot, Gabrielle.&quot; 
She squeezed the woman&#39;s hand, rubbing their fingers together softly. 
Her very touch was erotic; Gabrielle gave out a hum of pleasure, and 
Lilian laughed. Silence took over again, because neither of them really 
trusted the moment with words.

&quot;You&#39;re so pretty when ya laugh,&quot; whispered the redhead. &quot;And when ye 
blush.&quot; Lilian laughed and blushed at the same time, which only made 
Gabrielle smile broader. She clicked her tongue and said, &quot;Lor&#39;, we&#39;re 
too friggin&#39; cute for our own good. So tell me, Lil, ya havin&#39; a party 
for your birthday?&quot; Lilian&#39;s smile faded rapidly into a frown, and she 
hung her head and walked a little slower. Lilian rarely talked about her 
home life, or really her life in general, so at first Gabrielle thought 
she was treading on ice. But Lilian seemed okay in telling her.

&quot;Ja, my first real party since I was thirteen. I&#39;m supposed to go to 
this big stupid gala ball... I guess you could call it my &#39;coming of 
age&#39; party. My parents had it planned out since I was seventeen, at my 
last party. They said, &#39;Lilian, next year you will be an adult... so you 
need to be treated as an adult&#39;, and some other things. They already 
started planning the whole stupid thing, and come New Year&#39;s, they&#39;ll be 
ready.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t sound too enthusiastic.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;My parents mean well, but it&#39;s like I don&#39;t 
even exist to them. All my parties I&#39;ve had since I turned thirteen have 
been very quiet, very lonely. They get me a small cake with no candles, 
and give me two or three presents, usually things I need, like clothes, 
materials, things like that, although I did get a few books I liked, and 
last year I got a movie.&quot;

&quot;Oh, God. Lilian, honey, we gotta do something about all that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad,&quot; sighed the albino, holding the umbrella in one hand 
and her girlfriend&#39;s palm in the other. &quot;They don&#39;t make a big deal of 
it, and neither do I. I just get closer to being an adult; that&#39;s when 
they actually care. More than likely it will be my last party; I think 
they expect me to get my own place after I graduate. Which I will, 
happily.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So... tell me about this eighteenth birthday party of yours. I 
mean, ya must know something.&quot;

&quot;Ja, like I said, they&#39;ve been planning it for a whole year. I&#39;m 
supposed to dress up, do my hair, wear makeup, nonsense like that. They 
expect me to, you know, be on my best manners and such, and probably 
bring a date.&quot;

&quot;Yup, that&#39;s me.&quot; Lilian broke out of her monotone and laughed sharply. 
Gabrielle grinned and swung her girlfriend&#39;s arm around merrily.

&quot;Oh, Gabrielle,&quot; she sighed as she calmed down, &quot;it would mean so much 
if you could come with me and... be my date. It would be a real party 
with you. Please say you&#39;ll come.&quot;

&quot;Honey,&quot; she declared proudly, &quot;you had me at hello!&quot;

&quot;Wha?&quot;

&quot;Eh, nothing. So, like, tell me more. Will there be food, presents, 
guests, what?&quot;

&quot;Ja,&quot; she resumed, &quot;a big gala ball, with lots of fart-heads I don&#39;t 
even know.&quot; Now Gabrielle laughed sharply, and Lilian soon joined her. 
Neither one stopped for a whole minute, drawing some attention to them 
as they walked around the arboretum.

&quot;Fart-heads!&quot; cackled Gab, &quot;That&#39;s great! Lil, you&#39;re frickin&#39; 
hilarious!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just the way I feel!&quot; she exclaimed happily. &quot;Vater und mutter 
have already made out the list. Nobody I know, of course, and certainly 
not anyone my age. No children either.&quot;

&quot;Oh, man.&quot; Gabrielle lost her merriment and gave her girlfriend a sad 
stare. &quot;Oh, Lilian. Lilian, honey. We&#39;ve got to do something about 
that.&quot; She smiled at her girlfriend, and took her hand tenderly.

&quot;As long as you come, it&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m there,&quot; she promised. Lilian chuckled. &quot;So what else can I expect?&quot;

&quot;Umm... good music, great food, weird guests neither of us know, my 
vater und mutter... dad and mom, I mean.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay. Oh! You&#39;ll have to teach me some German! Ya know, if I&#39;m 
gonna be your date, I better impress your folks! I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d 
think kindly of me if all I can say from your language is a few words 
and phrases.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good idea. Um, what do you want to know?&quot;

&quot;Obviously, I&#39;d like to say &#39;Hello, sir and ma&#39;am&#39;, and &#39;My name is 
Gabrielle&#39;, and things like that.&quot;

&quot;Well, &#39;hello sir and ma&#39;am&#39; is Guten tag, herr und frau.&quot; Gabrielle 
tried repeating it, and Lilian pronounced it very slowly until her 
girlfriend got it right. &quot;Very good! You should also know this: Es ist 
mir eine Freude sie endlich kennenzulernen.&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Gabrielle became as pale as Lilian, and asked, &quot;What does that 
mean?&quot;

&quot;It means, &#39;It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you&#39;.&quot; She grinned, and 
Gabrielle smiled meekly.

&quot;Ho boy, I will have to know that. ...Es ist mir eine Freude sie...&quot;

&quot;Es ist mir eine Freude sie endlich kennenzulernen. Slowly.&quot; She and 
Gabrielle went over the words together, again and again, Lilian being 
very patient with her girlfriend until at last she could say it 
properly. Gabrielle whistled and wiped her forehead.

&quot;I feel like a parrot.&quot;

&quot;Mm, don&#39;t worry, my parents speak English too. We are all bilingual.&quot;

&quot;Good to know.&quot; The girls smiled again, and let silence conquer them. 
Lilian took a deep breath.

&quot;So you are really going with me...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, of course!&quot;

&quot;That is wonderful, Gabrielle. I would love for you to be my date.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to come,&quot; she answered. &quot;So what should I wear?&quot;

&quot;Mmm... something you&#39;d wear to very formal affairs.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I don&#39;t have anything like that. I got a few dress clothes, but 
they&#39;d never pass.&quot;

&quot;I could buy you something.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, honey, no, I couldn&#39;t impose.&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t impose,&quot; she replied. &quot;I would be happy to, really I 
would. I owe you more than you know for agreeing to come with me. 
Really, it&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. I owe you a lot.&quot; Gabrielle blushed as Lilian whispered to her, 
grinned, and leaned over to kiss her cheek. Lilian squealed happily, and 
returned the kiss. Gabrielle turned around after feeling the moist lips 
of her girlfriend, and they both exchanged a sweet kiss underneath a 
blue umbrella, blue sky.

&quot;Would your parents...&quot; whispered Gabrielle apprehensively, &quot;be okay 
with you going out with a woman?&quot;

&quot;Mm, I don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t care about me, so why should I care about 
them?&quot;

&quot;Lil, don&#39;t say that, hon. If they didn&#39;t care for you, why have this 
party?&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m their only child, and somebody has to carry on the family 
name. To answer your question, schatz, I don&#39;t think they&#39;d like it very 
well at all, but... what does that matter? They could not separate me 
from you.&quot; Gabrielle smiled warmly, full of love, and rubbed her nose 
against Lilian&#39;s. She snapped out to kiss her, startling Gabrielle, and 
the two laughed as they continued to walk, and talk, and hold hands.

............

Janet Keys had not gone on a serious date since her late husband passed 
away, and she never, ever thought she&#39;d ever go on a date with another 
woman, let alone someone who had been a student of hers six years 
earlier. Elspeth Post had asked her out for a casual dinner between 
coworkers, and there, Janet had learned the truth: that &quot;Ellie&quot; was 
bisexual, leaning towards homosexual, and she had carried a crush on 
Keys since her first year at Stanton, a decade ago. To say that Janet 
was surprised was like saying her drink was wet (she had spat some of it 
out in shock and got the poor drama teacher wet).

&quot;Ellie, that&#39;s just... no. No,&quot; she had insisted. &quot;I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t, El. 
I&#39;m forty-one years old, a widow, heterosexual, an art teacher, and a 
foster mother. I mean... even if I were interested in you&#151;and no 
offense, I&#39;m not&#151;we both work at the same place, and... Joss! How would 
Joss take it!? Look, I&#39;m just... I know I&#39;m upsetting you, El, but I 
can&#39;t be selfish about this. I can&#39;t. No, sorry.&quot;

Elspeth looked hurt. Janet tried to smooth things over. Then she stepped 
into foolish, dangerous territory, and compromised. Two dates, she said, 
but she chose where they went, and then they would stop. Elspeth would 
look for a woman more her age and Janet would prepare for being a foster 
grandmother. They would not&#151;they could not&#151;get any more intimate than 
the level they were at now, and Elspeth could ask no great personal 
question.

&quot;I wonder why I&#39;m so anxious about this,&quot; murmured Janet to herself as 
she stared at her reflection. She was at the peak of middle age but 
looked wonderful: her figure was full and curvy, very proper for a woman 
her age, and &quot;mature&quot; wrinkles and spots of dark gray had only just 
begun to sprout. Everything was in place, she was well-dressed and made 
up like a woman, and she smelled good. But her stomach became home to 
bees and butterflies, as if she were dating a man instead.

&quot;I know I&#39;m not gay,&quot; she whispered as she touched the mirror, &quot;nor even 
remotely so, despite being an art teacher. I like Ellie all right, but 
not like that. And she used to be my student! Huh. What a revelation. 
I&#39;m still reeling. Better check on Joss.&quot; (She was usually prone to 
talking out loud to further comfort herself and rationalize situations, 
and she didn&#39;t consider the act crazy)

Janet peeked in on her foster daughter and smiled. Jocelyn was busy with 
a video game, and her best friend Erica Fox was in on it as well. Janet 
cleared her throat and got the girls&#39; attention.

&quot;You two all right?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; It wasn&#39;t weird for Erica being in a teacher&#39;s house, since 
Janet seemed more like a friend to the students than an instructor&#151;and 
besides, ever since Jocelyn moved in, she had visited enough to be 
accustomed to it.

&quot;Erica, Jocelyn already knows this, but I&#39;ll be going out for awhile. I 
left you some money in case you wanna go out somewhere or order a pizza. 
Don&#39;t stay up too late, okay Joss?&quot;

&quot;Sure, mom.&quot; Janet smiled as her heart warmed. She loved being called 
Mom by Jocelyn, even though they were not even closely related. It made 
Jocelyn happy, though, so she allowed it.

&quot;Where ya goin&#39;, Mrs. Keys?&quot; asked Erica.

&quot;On a date. There&#39;s this outdoor arboretum that I like to jog around. I 
hear it looks great in the moonlight.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sounds like a romantic evening! Anyone special coming with you?&quot;

&quot;Just an old friend of mine. I won&#39;t be out long. I guess I better get 
going.&quot; She waved farewell after looking at her watch, and closed the 
door on her daughter and company. Jocelyn paused the game, let out a 
long breath, and rubbed her face.

&quot;Frustrated?&quot; asked Erica kindly.

&quot;Uh... mom&#39;s acting a little unusual. I mean, it&#39;s not the first time 
she&#39;s been on a date since I came, but... something tells me it&#39;s 
different. Call it soon-to-be-motherly intuition.&quot;

&quot;I think your soon-to-be-motherly intuition is whacked.&quot; Erica laughed 
and forcibly unpaused the game, making Jocelyn yelp. She gave her friend 
a swat, emerged victorious, and performed a small victory dance. Erica 
groaned.

&quot;Oh stop, you look ridiculous, Joss.&quot;

&quot;Do not. So tell me about Amina.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re friends. I already said that.&quot;

&quot;Did you kiss her?&quot;

&quot;No. She&#39;s not gay, Joss.&quot;

&quot;Too bad for you, huh?&quot;

&quot;Mm, not really. Plenty of women still on the market.&quot;

&quot;Ew, don&#39;t you ever compare women to produce.&quot; They both laughed, and 
Jocelyn sat down because she was feeling tired. Erica snuggled up to 
her, holding her body gently with her arms, and leaned up to give her 
best friend a kiss on her cheek.

&quot;Thought of what you&#39;re going to name the baby?&quot; she whispered. Jocelyn 
smiled.

&quot;Theodore if it&#39;s a boy, Dorothy if it&#39;s a girl.&quot;

&quot;Quaint. Any reason why?&quot;

&quot;Theodore means &#39;gift from God&#39;, and Dorothy means &#39;goddess of gifts&#39;. 
Either way, I think it&#39;ll be a fitting name for the baby. Their middle 
name will either be Janet or Henderson.&quot; (Henderson had been the name of 
Janet&#39;s late husband)

&quot;Not Erica?&quot; Jocelyn grinned.

&quot;Oh, of course. The baby will have two middle names: Eric if it&#39;s a 
boy...&quot;

&quot;And Erica if it&#39;s a girl.&quot; Now they both grinned, Fox giving McKeough a 
thank-you hug. &quot;So,&quot; she asked, &quot;will I still be the kid&#39;s godmother?&quot;

&quot;Of course. I&#39;d be honored.&quot; Erica smiled and hugged her friend (Jocelyn 
truly loved hugs), and without really thinking or meaning to, she 
touched both her cheeks and gave her a brief kiss on the lips.

The odd thing was not Jocelyn&#39;s reaction, but the fact that it had not 
been their first.

.........

Janna Raulson was petrified with grief. Her cellphone finally collapsed 
to the floor with a bang after being held so loosely, so long. What a 
brief message that had been. At least Abi had the courtesy to call, but 
it was a short one, and she sounded so careless. Raulson wished that she 
could&#39;ve been the one to puncture through the lovely Miss Cerio, to make 
her see that a long-term relationship was beautiful, and she need not 
spend her life hopping between beds and breasts.

Her message said, &quot;Hi Janna, it&#39;s me. Listen, um, I&#39;ve had a good time 
with you, so I think maybe we could end this relationship on a high 
note. You&#39;ve been a wonderful girlfriend, but me... well, I don&#39;t like 
to get tied down, even with someone as sweet and sexy as you are. Don&#39;t 
worry, you&#39;ll find someone better, someone you deserve. Me? Haha... stay 
away from me, I&#39;m trouble. Seriously, though, it was great for awhile, 
don&#39;t you think? It&#39;s my opinion that this is the best way to end this. 
I hope you&#39;re not too hurt, honey. See you at work, bye!&quot;

Janna Raulson covered her eyes so she wouldn&#39;t cry. She had told Abi she 
loved her. What a foolish waste of emotion that had been! Depressed, and 
with no one to turn to, she resigned herself to a hot bath and the 
newspaper classified ads again. Out with the young, in with someone she 
knew she wouldn&#39;t like nearly as much. It was so frustrating...

Damn you, Abi, she sighed. If you liked me so much, why&#39;d you let me go?

Love gave Janna Raulson no mercy.

......

That night produced many strange occurrences, things and events that 
affected many people, and in turn, many of the people affected believed 
the strange occurrences would never happen to them. They seemed too 
unlikely, but fact oftentimes was more queer than fiction. It was by no 
fault of the moon, which was in the middle of its phase, nor the stars, 
as the Bard had agreed upon, but of something or another inside each 
person, something that told them to go, carpe dium (which ironically was 
darkening), do it, before worse things befell them: before they began to 
regret.

Janet Keys stood stone still as Elspeth Post kissed her.

Amina Washim found friendship with Nomi Nakatori... and more.

Sarah Johansson and Emma McGowen slept together.

Janna Raulson lost Abi Cerio to Dr. Andrews.

Erica became more than a godmother.

And Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon fell deeper in love with Lilian Nachtheim.

Not all of these strange occurrences were unwelcome.

In fact, some passed with great beauty.

Others...

&quot;Fuck,&quot; whispered X, searching around her room in the nude, &quot;where&#39;s my 
God-fucking-damned panties?&quot; Zane purred with lust as she watched the 
nude woman wander around, breasts jiggling and rear end curving.

&quot;I think you threw them out your window in a fit of animal lust,&quot; she 
said. Walker froze and gave her new lover a horrified stare.

&quot;I whaaaaaaaat?!?!?!?!&quot;</pre>
