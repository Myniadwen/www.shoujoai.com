<h1>Rival Rage: The Beginning of Aerolust (part 11 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&#147;What&#146;s this? Konoko&#146;s been attacked?&#148;

Ayane was incensed. Things like this had happened before but never on 
such serious terms. Tomeishuu High was like sacred ground because so 
many other gangs had tried to take it over. The Cross Blade Lancers 
and the Spring Breeze Assassins had resisted every band of punks as 
rogues that have attempted it. But this was so direct and so... 
calculated. A bunch of yobs jumping a Spring Breeze Assassin from 
behind was a standard action, but it wouldn&#146;t result in an exchange of 
power. 

These &#145;Kyoto New Force Strikers&#146; seemed to realize this. They had left 
a formal challenge to Ayane. And from the codes of honour that she 
held, she could not back down. 

Ayane was sitting parallel to Izumi on a table in the lunchroom of 
Tomeishuu High. It was Monday, two days after the leader of the KNFS, 
Zanga, defeated Konoko. 

&#147;No, Ayane.&#148; Izumi breathed. &#147;Konoko was challenged and she lost. The 
reckless fool probably took the guy on as training for you. Little did 
she know that this guy ain&#146;t no ordinary fighter.&#148;

Ayane thought this. &#147;Hmm... So what have you found out about them? 
What are they like? What are their goals?&#148;

&#147;Hey, chill. I&#146;ve been sniffing around, trying to dig up some dirt. 
From what I hear, they are from Kyoto and they have only three 
members. One is a girl, but I have no idea who she is. The other two 
are guys, both go to Tengoku Aijin School, just north of here.&#148;

&#147;I know that.&#148; Ayane confirmed. &#147;Tengoku Aijin (oddly named) doesn&#146;t 
have that many fighters worth any attention. But what do you expect 
from a school full of men.&#148;

Izumi rolled her eyes. &#147;That aside, the Kyoto New Force Strikers two 
male members are Ranji Masami and a guy named Zanga. I hear Ranji is a 
cutie, but kinda has his head in the clouds. Zanga on the other hand, 
he&#146;s pretty brutal. This is all I know. And I was only able to get 
this from some of my connections in Kyoto-central.&#148;

&#147;That was their previous school?&#148; Ayane asked.

&#147;Uh huh. They were really secretive so there isn&#146;t much stuff I could 
find out. Ranji and the girl are fairly powerful fighters, but that 
Zanga guy. Something doesn&#146;t feel right about it...&#148;

Ayane grinned. This guy sounded like a decent challenge. &#147;Okay then. 
It will be enjoyable fighting this man if he is as strong as you say.&#148;

&#147;Are you crazy?&#148; Izumi dropped the fork she was holding. &#147;It&#146;s obvious 
what they&#146;re after. They want power over Tomeishuu High. If they do, 
then it isn&#146;t our problem. Leave it to Ikatsuji and Cross Blade 
Lancers to handle. They are the ones in control, it&#146;s their 
responsibility.&#148; 

&#147;Regardless of what they want, they still hurt one of my team mates. 
Konoko has always been a power hungry fool but she is still in my 
gang. I&#146;ll have to face this Zanga anyway, he challenged me and I 
won&#146;t back down.&#148;

Izumi sighed. Ayane was too honourable for her own good. &#147;Well, 
whatever you wish, boss. Maybe it&#146;s best to nip this in the bud before 
it gets out of hand.&#148;

Ayane&#146;s eyes became distant as she spoke on. &#147;One thing, Izumi.&#148;

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;I do not want Rinako or the Cross Blade Lancers involved in this 
issue. Keep as quiet about this as you possibly can, alright?&#148;

Izumi had a confused expression on her face. &#147;Sure, but why? I mean if 
the Kyoto New Force Strikers do want Tomeishuu then it&#146;s their problem 
right? It&#146;s the job of the ruling gang to protect the school from 
outsiders.&#148;

Ayane squirmed within herself. She still had yet to tell Izumi about 
her relationship with Rinako. Which was mostly why she did not want 
Rinako involved in this situation. Though the older Ikatsuji sister 
was arguably the most powerful fighter in Tomeishuu, Ayane still felt 
a little protective of her. 

&#147;Just do it for me, Izumi. Alright?&#148;

Izumi nodded, taking note of Ayane&#146;s seriousness. &#147;Alright.&#148;

**********

Rinako and Minato waited patiently just behind the science department 
of the school. It was lunch, and neither Rinako nor Minato had any 
classes until the last period. Minato was going to spend her free time 
exactly the way she wanted to. 

With Natsumi. 

It was the best thing for Rinako. She wanted to show that there didn&#146;t 
need to be any hard feelings between herself and Natsumi. Not just 
because Rinako had learned to accept her, but more for Minato&#146;s 
benefit. The older Ikatsuji girl saw that twinkle her sister would get 
in her eyes anytime she spoke of Natsumi. Minato was head over heels 
for the girl. There was no way Rinako could stand in the way of that. 
Otherwise she would be replicating the same act as her father did. 
Rinako still had trouble believing that. Rinako&#146;s own father had been 
the direct cause of the two-year rift between her and Ayane. Well, 
whatever his mistakes, Rinako was not going to do the same thing to 
Minato. 

&#147;I wonder where she is.&#148; Minato said. &#147;It&#146;s already 1.55.&#148; 

Rinako looked around for the Yakume-girl. &#147;She&#146;ll be here. I know she 
will.&#148;

Just as that was said, a familiar face peered from around the corner 
of the building. It was Natsumi. Minato&#146;s heart swelled with joy to 
see her love. The force of her affection had been growing ever since 
she met Natsumi. After being without her for 6 days, that attraction 
was hard to miss.

The two just stared at each other of a few seconds, unwilling to say 
anything, with Rinako watching from the side. She could feel her 
younger sister&#146;s indecision. But it was okay.

Rinako rested a hand on Minato&#146;s shoulder and smiled. &#147;Go to her, 
Minato.&#148;

The blonde girl smiled at her sister. Rinako was okay about this. 
Minato chuckled happily and ran towards her love, Natsumi. The miko 
was stumbled back with a happy smile as Minato ran into her arms. They 
were together again.

Minato nuzzled herself into Natsumi&#146;s embrace. &#147;I missed you, Natsumi. 
I missed you so much...&#148;

Natsumi brought a hand to Minato&#146;s head, running her fingers through 
the blue-eyed girl&#146;s locks of long blonde hair. &#147;I missed you too, 
Mina-chan. But its okay now, sweetie. We&#146;re together.&#148; 

Rinako smiled at the two. They really were good for each other. There 
was no way she could obstruct that. Natsumi lifted her head up slowly 
to sneak a peek at Rinako. She mouthed a quick &#145;thank you&#146; to the CBL 
leader. She knew full well that Rinako did this for Minato, not her, 
but all the same, Natsumi was grateful. 

Rinako just nodded in acceptance. As long as those two were happy 
together, that was all that mattered. 

**********

&#147;You think I did the right thing?&#148;

It was night, a cool, breezy night, familiar of Tokyo. Rinako was on 
the roof of the northern block in Tomeishuu High, with her lover 
Ayane&#146;s arms wrapped tenderly around her from behind her. They were 
over looking the large grassy courtyard and from that she remembered 
seeing Natsumi take Minato out to talk things through.

Ayane questioned Rinako, tightening her grip a little. &#147;With what?&#148;

&#147;With Minato and Natsumi.&#148; Rinako said quietly. &#147;I mean I know she can 
look out for herself and everything, but I&#146;m still worried about her. 
She&#146;s changing so fast. Up until a few days ago I didn&#146;t even know 
that Minato was into girls. I&#146;m just wondering... will she be okay? I 
know how confused I felt when I was falling in love with you, so...&#148;

Ayane understood that. Discovering your true sexuality was never an 
easy thing. It was easier for Ayane because she disliked men in 
general, but for people like Minato and Rinako, things were a little 
different. 

&#147;She has a good head on her shoulders, Rinako. I do not know if you 
have noticed this, but not once have I heard a shred of doubt about 
their feelings for each other. Your sister probably understands 
herself better than you think.&#148;

Rinako nodded. &#147;Yeah. It was different for us back then, I suppose. We 
were friends and rivals at the same time. It was kinda mystifying to 
find out how I felt about you. If I could go back in time... there are 
so many things I would do differently...&#148;

Ayane was playfully curious. &#147;Like what?&#148;

&#147;Well...&#148; Rinako got a devious glint in her eye. &#147;I would have taken 
it a little easier on you during sparring sessions if knew that you 
had a thing for me. But, every time you lost, you&#146;d do that cute 
little pouting cheek thing that you do.&#148;

Ayane&#146;s cheeks pouted inadvertently as Rinako said that. &#147;What are you 
talking about?&#148;

Rinako turned her head around enough to see Ayane&#146;s face. Sure enough, 
she was pouting. &#147;You see! There it is again. You have this accidental 
sexiness that drives me wild, you know.&#148;   

&#147;Rinako... you take great pleasure in embarrassing me don&#146;t you?&#148;

A playful giggle escaped her lips. &#147;So you noticed? Heh! Oh come on, 
you mean to tell me that you never checked me out while we were 
training? Not even a quick peek...?&#148;

Ayane&#146;s blush deepened, and she mumbled something as she looked away. 
&#147;...Yes, a couple of times...&#148;

&#147;Like...?&#148; Rinako prodded.

Ayane surrendered in defeat. Rinako would never leave her alone about 
this until she knew, so... &#147;There were occasions where we used to 
spar, when I would,&#148; Ayane coughed. &#147;I would... *accidentally* not 
look away when the front of your Gi would open up from the wind 
resistance...&#148;

The young purple-haired girl sweatdropped. &#147;Geez... I guess I should 
have worn a bra or something, huh?&#148;

&#147;It might have helped my concentration a little, yes.&#148;

The two young lovers burst into laughter. As soon as that laughter 
died down, their lips closed in on each other for a passionate kiss. 
It was so strange from an outside perspective. A week ago they would 
have sooner punch each other than be talking like this. It was living 
proof that any love could be salvaged if you fought hard enough for 
it. And as Rinako felt that wave of elation shoot through her spine as 
her lips made contact with Ayane&#146;s...

...She knew that their love would last forever.

**********

Saturday. 

One whole week after the defeat of Konoko. The time for the battle 
between Zanga and Ayane had arrived. All information regarding Zanga 
and the Kyoto New Force Strikers had been successfully kept from 
Rinako and the Cross Blade Lancers. Whatever her attitude was like, 
Izumi always kept her word. 

Ayane had been training for this, but she did overexert herself. She 
was pretty sure she could handle this. 

With a proud determination, Ayane marched down to Mizube Ai Park for 
the fight. Since this was sort of a &#145;Tomeishuu pride&#146; thing, Ayane 
came dressed in her schoolgirl uniform. Izumi was with her, but 
besides her, nobody else was coming. Not even Konoko (who had kept her 
mouth closed about the incident from humiliation) was allowed to come. 
It was better this way, though. The less people knew about the duel, 
the less chance of leaking out to Rinako.

After a short walk, Ayane and Izumi reached Mizube Ai Park. It was a 
beautiful sunny day, with a small cooling gust all the same. Perfect 
for fighting. 

The secret area of the park was at a northern part of it. Though 
Mizube Ai Park was a beautiful place, a lot of serious, territorial 
fights took place there. Since this was an early Saturday morning, 
there wouldn&#146;t be any one else getting in the way. 

The two Spring Breeze Assassins stepped through a bushy mesh of trees 
and overhanging grass at the northern gate of the park, and before 
they knew it, they were at the secret area. 

The secret area was 48-metre long layer of soft stone etched into the 
ground. This stone was unmarked and clear, albeit a little dust, and 
was the staging ground for many important battles. Just as they had 
said, Ranji and Zanga were waiting on the other side of the grounds. 
Ranji (as usual) was dressed in his traditional Tengoku Aijin uniform 
and Zanga was wearing normal battle outfit, the one he used in his 
fight with Konoko. 

Ayane eyed them over, whispering to Izumi. &#147;Which one is Zanga?&#148;

Izumi pointed over to the taller one. &#147;That guy. The guy with the 
spiky hair and white pants.&#148;

So that was Zanga. Ayane searched his aura. This boy wasn&#146;t a run of 
the mill fighter. Well, she expected that. Any man who thought he had 
a chance against the Spring Breeze Assassins with only 3 members to 
his gang had to be important. 

Ranji smiled and Zanga grinned, as Ayane and Izumi were clearly 
visible from the other side of the grounds. 

&#147;Welcome, Yosukube Ayane.&#148; Ranji said cordially. &#147;We have been waiting 
for you. I must say it is a pleasure to meet you. We have heard 
stories about your great strength and power.&#148;

Ayane motioned for Izumi to stay where she was, and the second in 
command of the SBA nodded to accept that. Ayane walked out into the 
stone grounds to come face to face with her enemy. Zanga saw this and 
also walked on the arena, still grinning that toothy grin of his. 

Before they knew it, they were at eye level. Zanga was slightly taller 
than Ayane was, but this courageous young fighter was not intimidated. 

The leader of the KNFS eyed over the leader of the SBA. &#147;So you are 
the one they call the &#145;Frozen Dragon&#146;. You are the counterpart to 
Rinako Ikatsuji, the &#145;Burning Tiger&#146;. I must say I am honoured to meet 
you.&#148;

Ayane stared at Zanga curiously. How the hell did he know those names? 
Those were the names given to Ayane and Rinako at the Ikatsuji 
Fighting Institution. There was no way that he could know about that. 

&#147;How do you know me by that name?&#148; Ayane asked defensively. &#147;I 
discarded that title a long time ago.&#148;

Zanga crossed his arms, titling his head to one side. &#147;I know a great 
deal more about you and the Ikatsuji woman than you realize. In time I 
will come to tell you of my secrets. But until then... we will 
fight...&#148;

Ayane tightened her disposition and took on a fighting stance, her 
left hand forged into a fist by her side and her other hand palmed out 
in front of her. This was what she came for. There was no need to 
enter discussions when neither of them wanted it. Soon enough, Ayane&#146;s 
foot pushed off the ground as she leapt over at Zanga. The fight would 
begin now.

**********

Rinako walked through the halls of Tomeishuu&#146;s northern block. She 
really didn&#146;t have much to do. There wasn&#146;t an exam until next week, 
but Rinako could not study on that unless Mishizu was with her. And, 
unfortunately, Mishizu was meeting up with her sister and mother in 
Roppongi. Apparently there was a really lovable American themed 
restaurant that they wanted to go to. 

Minato was out with Natsumi on there forth date of the week, but 
Rinako had never seen her sister happier. There was the option of 
training, but she didn&#146;t feel much like it. Truth be told, Rinako 
wanted to go see Ayane, but she was out on some kind of business, and 
besides, that option was closed to her until they could be more open 
about their relationship. 

It was dilemma, but Rinako just decided to go watch some TV. Maybe 
there was something half-decent on. Filling herself with that new 
idea, Rinako swung around and began to walk over to the common room. 
But before she could, someone barged into her.

Konoko.

Rinako stopped where she was and glared at the girl. Her face was 
still a bit bruised up, and Rinako was curious as to what that was 
about. None the less...

&#147;Do you have some kinda problem?&#148; Rinako barked. &#147;I&#146;m not in the mood 
for a battle but if you push me I won&#146;t refuse.&#148;

Konoko snorted. &#147;Oh yeah, right, like I care. You Cross Blade Lancer 
scum make me sick. I dunno why Yosukube doesn&#146;t just let you fight 
your own battles.&#148;

Rinako&#146;s honey brown eyes shot open. Something was up with Ayane. 
&#147;What the heck is that supposed to mean?&#148;

&#147;Hmph!&#148; Konoko smiled, knowing that she had an edge over Rinako. &#147;Why 
should I tell you anything?&#148;  

That was it. Rinako had enough with having to tease out information 
from the Spring Breeze Assassins. With a mild growl, Rinako grabbed 
Konoko by the collar and thrust her up against the wall, staring down 
the subordinate SBA with powerful, commanding eyes.

&#147;Listen here, you little punk.&#148; Rinako yelled. &#147;If it has something to 
do with Ayane then it&#146;s my business! Tell me where she is or I swear I 
will launch your sorry ass right through this wall.&#148;

A gulp slivered down Konoko&#146;s throat. And fear did the talking for 
her. &#147;Ayane is at the secret ground behind Mizube Ai Park. Some guy 
named Zanga challenged her to a battle.&#148;

Rinako searched her memories. She couldn&#146;t recall the name Zanga. 
&#147;What else? Who is he?&#148; 

&#147;He&#146;s the leader of a gang called the Kyoto New Force Strikers. I 
think they want Tomeishuu...&#148;

That was all she needed to know. Rinako dropped Konoko&#146;s collar, and 
made a dash for the door out of the hallway. Ayane was fighting some 
one, and Rinako had to be there.

{Why didn&#146;t she tell me?} Rinako thought. {God, I hope she&#146;s okay.}

**********

Zanga hopped to one side as Ayane&#146;s branched out leg swung around the 
cold stone floor, whipping up a wave of dust as she moved. Zanga&#146;s 
feet came to rest a few short metres from Ayane. 

The Spring Breeze Assassin stood up and observed this man. He was 
quite agile. Which was something that Ayane did not prepare for. 
Still, there was no need to worry. His movements were quick but not 
unreadable. 

Zanga took on another fighting stance and waited for Ayane&#146;s next 
move. The young woman ran towards him, ignoring that arrogant smirk of 
his. Soon as Ayane was in range, hopped on one leg and Zanga swung it 
around in a circular motion. Ayane ducked under his roundhouse kick, 
slinking closer to him now that he left an opening. Ayane pulled back 
her left fist and shot out her right one in a vacuous uppercut, 
grazing Zanga&#146;s lightly tanned cheek. 

It didn&#146;t knock that stupid grin of his face but it came close. To 
supplement her assault, Ayane thrust her left fist at Zanga&#146;s other 
cheek, hitting him dead on with angelic precision. The Slash Fang 
warrior slid back from Ayane and rubbed his jaw. 

Still, he did not attack Ayane; rather he readied himself and waited 
for her next move. 

{Hmm...} Ayane mused. {His style seems to be very relaxed. I know of a 
fighting art that has that characteristic... but what was it called? 
There was some sort of secret hidden within it but for some reason I 
cannot remember what it is...} 

Instead of thinking that through, Ayane ran towards Zanga once more. 
Whatever secret his style possessed, he would eventually reveal it 
during the match. Ayane lunged in on the lithe fighter, smoothing out 
her hand into a knife-edged chop. Her hand darted at the face of 
Zanga, swiping fiercely at his flesh in a quick motion. Ayane&#146;s second 
hand followed the path its twin had left for it, and her silky hand 
cut through the air, slicing at Zanga&#146;s chest. Since he was topless, 
that blow managed to have a more potent effect than it normally would 
on someone. 

Even so, Zanga continued to grin. This woman was powerful. It would be 
an interesting battle to see her go down. A third attack aimed for the 
KNFS leader&#146;s face came again. Zanga darted his head to one side, and 
punched Ayane firmly from this opening. 

Ayane gasped as his fist connected with her jaw, but was forced to do 
so again as Zanga&#146;s other fist came at her waist. She had to act. The 
white-haired girl leaned to one side, dodging the punch. She the 
clamped down hard on it with her left hand. The second hand grabbed 
the middle of his arm, and Ayane spun around, her back facing Zanga&#146;s 
front. She then cocked her body forwards, dragging Zanga&#146;s arm 
downwards while doing so, using her bodily position for leverage. 
Before he knew it, Zanga was being pulled over Ayane&#146;s body and was 
expertly thrown into the hard ground. 

Over at the side of the ground, Ranji was watching this with some 
confusion, whereas Izumi was jumping for joy. 

&#147;Whoo! That&#146;s the stuff, boss!&#148; She yelled. &#147;Show them what it means 
to fight a Spring Breeze Assassin!&#148;

Zanga grunted hard, while Ayane backed up a bit. That throw of hers 
&#145;Oshitaosu&#146; (overpower) was designed to disable physically stronger 
opponents. But this man was bringing himself to his feet *very* 
quickly. She had to put this guy away before he used anymore of that 
power of his. Ayane stood still for a second; tapping into her Chi. 
All thoughts were on her body as the flow of her natural energies took 
on a new pace. Suddenly her body began to glow with a very pale blue, 
and she cupped her hands behind her. 

Zanga drew up to his feet completely, and turned around to see Ayane, 
burning with the flames of her own icy sapphire Chi. Then his eyes 
went wide with concern as her hands were plunged forwards, her palm 
splayed out and her arms separated slightly. 

&#147;Rai shou en ken no himitsu gijutsu sambyaku yo! Atsuryokuken!&#148;

(Rai shou en ken&#39;s secret technique 300! Pressure Fist!)

In the form of a circular sphere, a blast of icy blue Chi shot out 
from Ayane&#146;s palms in Zanga&#146;s direction. The warrior brought up his 
arms to defend himself from it, but it was no use. Zanga growled with 
shock as the blast knocked him off her feet and across the dusty 
grounds. He crashed crudely into the stone floor and rolled along as 
the propelling force from the attack. 

Ayane lowered her hands and stood upright right from the leaning 
position she was previously in. She didn&#146;t usually use &#145;Atsuryokuken&#146; 
(Pressure Fist) on an enemy outside of Tomeishuu, it was the trademark 
move of the Rai shou en ken discipline, but this man&#146;s skill was 
demanding it. Both Izumi and Ayane thought that the battle must be 
over, but to their horror, Zanga was still moving. 

With that grin still painted on his face, the Slash Fang warrior was 
on his feet again, with no effort. Aside from that small trail of 
blood coming down his cheek, Zanga was more or less unaffected. 

Ayane was in shock. {He sustained consciousness after being hit with 
the Pressure Fist? Impossible!} 

Zanga wiped his cheek free of blood. &#147;So that was the flagship skill 
of the Rai shou en ken school? Abysmal! The new-age students of Genzo 
Ikatsuji seem to be lacking in firepower...&#148;

Now Ayane recognised that this situation was more serious that she had 
thought. And he somehow knew that Genzo had trained her. How did he 
know these things? Ayane&#146;s questions took a back seat as Zanga finally 
took the initiative and charged at her. Ayane knew that she could not 
let him gain any ground on her, and punched at the fighter before he 
got the chance. Zanga tucked to one side, avoiding Ayane&#146;s fist, and 
quickly crouched to the ground. He leaned back, swung his right leg 
out, and then brought it back around, curling it under the gold-eyed 
girl&#146;s heel. 

Ayane fell backwards under the sneaky deception of the &#145;Shoukyakuro&#146; 
(Incinerator) leg sweep. Zanga quickly brought his leg back and 
twirled up into a standing position, smiling with a wide grin. He then 
let out a fierce growl as he lifted his foot, and brought it down 
quickly. Ayane sensed this and rolled to one side, narrowly avoiding 
that stamping blow. Her searing gold eyes took a look at Zanga&#146;s foot. 
It had managed to crack the floor in small streaks. This man did not 
have an average strength. Again Zanga growled, and kicked Ayane hard 
in the root of her stomach, the force of his power knocked the wind 
right out of her. 

Izumi watched this with some horror. This guy was no joke. Zanga&#146;s 
eyes locked onto Ayane, who was struggling to get back on her feet. 
The fighter tensed his fist and punched down for Ayane, but it hit 
nothing but stone. 

Ayane had already anticipated the attack and was repeatedly back 
flipping across the arena to put some distance between herself and 
Zanga. With an elegant twirl, Ayane landed on her feet, automatically 
adopting a new, more urgent fighting stance. 

{That man has nightmarish strength.} Ayane assessed. {If I want to 
defeat him, I&#146;ll have to strike quickly before he can reciprocate.}

Ayane steeled herself, bracing herself with her back leg and 
tightening her fist. Seeing what she had to do, the Spring Breeze 
Assassin ran forwards, ignoring that worried look Izumi had in the 
distance. Soon her instincts kicked in, and her feet lost contact with 
the ground as she leapt forwards. Ayane straightened out her leg 
forwards, curling her arm to her side and folding her spare leg under 
her body. Zanga stared intently as Ayane neared him with her dreaded 
flying kick, &#145;Shuuchaku&#146; (Obsession). Zanga merely sidestepped the 
kick and Ayane flew past him, her feet screeching to a halt as they 
back to the ground. 

This did not faze Ayane however, and she came back at Zanga with a 
determined vigour. She kicked at him, her lissom leg grazing the 
atmosphere with its speed. Then Ayane gasped in shock. Zanga jetted 
into the air, almost in a blur, outmatching the speed of Ayane&#146;s kick. 
The Slash Fang warrior span in the air, sailing over his opponent in a 
flash and landing directly behind her. Instantly his strong arms were 
wrapped around her waist. 

&#147;Issho ni kuru... Tengoku e! Ikioi! Roketto tsuki saigai!&#148;

(Come with me... To heaven! (Momentum) Rocket Moon Disaster!)  

Using his brutal strength, Zanga lifted Ayane off her feet, arching 
his loose back to bring her over with him as he bended backwards. 
Ayane let out a distressed grunt as her head and lower back were 
slammed into the ground by means of an unholy backbreaker. 

Zanga&#146;s grip on Ayane slithered loose, and he rolled out from under 
her, standing up proudly as he inspected the fruits of his Rocket Moon 
Disaster attack. He suspected that she should at least have a 
concussion from that. 

Ayane groaned. It was hard to believe, but this fighter was stronger 
than her. What made it worse, was that he seemed to have knowledge of 
her fighting style. That was something that put him one step ahead. 
But what made it worse was his strength. His overall force was 
enormous in nature. And to top it all off, Zanga was strong without 
having a speed disadvantage. Ayane estimated that he was very nearly 
as fast as she was. She had to admit though; she felt a warrior&#146;s 
respect for this kind of power. 

But she was not going to through in the towel. 

Using all her strength, Ayane heaved herself into a crouching position 
and then she managed to stand on her power. Then she realized that 
there was only one way she could win. 

The Compression Blast. 

Never before had she used it in actual combat. Not once. Not even 
against Rinako. Zanga was the first person she had ever needed to use 
this move against. 

&#147;You&#146;re very powerful.&#148; Ayane said honestly. &#147;In truth, you are the 
first man to ever earn my respect on the battlefield. But I will not 
be defeated this day...&#148;

Zanga just grinned. &#147;Is that so? Well then... why don&#146;t you show me 
what you can do, eh? Show me the power of Rai shou en ken.&#148;

Ayane stepped back, and did her best to hold still. This had to be 
done correctly; otherwise she would not be able to focus the attack 
properly. The young woman spread apart her legs, and tautened her 
fists as tight as she could. Her eyes slowly shut closed, and once 
more she delved into that well of pure Chi that existed within her 
body. Bursts of adrenalin and intent flooded through her body as raw 
energy began gathering within the core of Ayane&#146;s soul. Almost in a 
zombie-like trance, Ayane&#146;s hands came before her stomach, creating a 
sort of ball shape in the gap between them. As soon as flames of her 
cobalt inner flame enveloped Ayane&#146;s body, energy started to resonate 
between her hands.  

Zanga stared at her, this was similar to the energy gathering she did 
for her previous energy attack, but this was different somehow. Ranji 
and Izumi watched quietly from the sidelines. But only Izumi knew the 
effort that Ayane was making. 

She was going all out. 

The air around the park suddenly grew colder as more of Ayane&#146;s inner 
Chi summoned raw energy amid her hands. Suddenly a strong wind broke 
out from the tension in the air, Zanga forced himself to cover his 
eyes as the wind flashed the dust around and about the place. A twinge 
was felt inside Ayane, and from that she knew that the attack was 
ready. 

&#147;Watashi no youshiki kanojo no chou gijutsu yo! Compression Buster!&#148; 

{My style... her ultimate technique! Compression Buster!}  

Ayane pushed both arms forwards, emitting a huge wave of sapphire blue 
energy. Zanga stared wide-eyed at this surge of icy power, it was a 
little more than he had expected. He quickly brought his hands back 
and gathered up his own energy as quickly as he could. As the 
gargantuan discharge neared him, he grinned deeply, projecting his 
hands forward. 

&quot;Ore wa okotte imasu! Ore no kobushi wa tachiageru! Lust Breaker!&quot;

{Now I&#39;m mad! My fist rises! Lust Breaker!} 

Zanga unleashed a ferocious shot of crystal-glowing emerald energy, so 
powerful, yet so condensed. The two blasts of spirit power collided, 
filling the whole arena with a flash of blinding blue and green light. 
Even Ranji and Izumi covered their eyes as colossal rocked the stone 
ground, which was creaking in thin streaks from the point of impact. 
Though standoff seemed to indicate to Ayane that her Compression Blast 
to be holding firm, Zanga knew differently. Although the Lust Breaker 
was a much smaller attack, its power was concentrated into such a 
degree that it was actually cutting though the Compression Blast&#146;s 
crystalline energy. The Lust Breaker ripped through Ayane&#146;s wave in a 
haze of green light and stormed over to the white-haired girl. 

That effort her tired her, but she had to move otherwise the Lust 
Breaker would knock her out. Ayane dived to the side, and rolled over 
as it exploded on contact with a set of trees over on the edge of the 
stone grounds. 

{What a fearsome power.} Ayane thought. {And I&#146;ve used up all my 
energy to pull off that Compression Blast... now what can I do?}

The blood red eyes of Zanga inspected Ayane. It was obvious that she 
had used up all her energy. With a victorious bellow, Zanga ran over 
to her. It was time to put the girl away. 

Ayane just found herself standing up, but without warning, Zanga came 
for her. The Spring Breeze Assassin could only yelp as he unleashed 
powerful chains of blows on her. A fist rammed into her stomach. A 
kick administered a blow to the head. Zanga continued his relentless 
assault to the shock of Izumi. 

Izumi struggled to maintain herself, but she couldn&#146;t just stand 
around and watch her friend get pummelled like that. However before 
she could even set foot on the stone floor, Ranji appeared next to 
her. 

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t do that if I were you.&#148; He said quietly. &#147;This is their 
fight. If you interfere that means I will have to step in as well. It 
would be best for them to finish their duel in the way they want.&#148;

Izumi scowled. &#147;You mean I should just stand here and let your jerk of 
a leader kick the crap out of my friend? You really think that I&#146;m 
stupid enough to listen to you?&#148;

Zanga was uncaring of whatever Izumi and Ranji were talking about. He 
continued to hammer away at a now weakening Ayane, her body becoming 
limp with lack of energy. After one final, searing punch to Ayane&#146;s 
jaw, the SBA leader toppled to the ground in a motionless heap, unable 
to fight back. Zanga had won. But he was not finished just yet. 
Yelling out again, he hoisted his foot in the air to stamp down on an 
unconscious Ayane. Until...

&#147;Stop it!&#148;

Zanga, Ranji and Izumi all looked over to the entrance to the secret 
area where that voice came from. It was Rinako. Tears were trailing 
down her eyes as she saw her only love in a mangled, comatose state. 
All thanks to that animal...

But rather than worry about Zanga, Rinako leapt onto the stone field 
and crouched down by her Ayane&#146;s side. Zanga just watched the two with 
an amused smirk, and motioned for Ranji to follow him. Ranji nodded 
and Zanga began to walk away, satiated with the defeat of Ayane 
Yosukube. 

But before her could leave, Rinako screamed out to him, her soft tears 
spilling onto the cold stone ground. &#147;Zanga!&#148;

Zanga looked back. &#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;I swear...&#148; Rinako was seething; her fists were clenched so tightly 
that her knuckles were turning a pallid white. &#147;I will kill you for 
this... I&#146;ll kill you!&#148;

Zanga just chuckled at Rinako. &#147;Ha, ha, ha! Don&#146;t worry, Ikatsuji. 
You&#146;re next...&#148;
