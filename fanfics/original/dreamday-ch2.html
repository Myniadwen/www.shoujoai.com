<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 2 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It was over seven years ago now, nevertheless Kris remembered it clearly 
as if it were yesterday. She lay atop a small grassy hill. The sun shone 
down on her sleeping form. Dark jacket, long sleeved shirt and pants 
covered her entire body  making her pale skin, strawberry blonde hair 
and freckles stand out even more. Below her other children could be 
heard playing tag and climbing on the jungle gym. She would continue to 
lay perfectly still and just listen to her surroundings. First, she 
blocked out the sounds of laughter, because she hated it so much. Hate 
is too harsh a word. It was more like she felt as if there was no reason 
for laughter so promptly blocked it from her mind. It was sort of a game 
for her. One by one she would pick out a voice and shut it off. Then, 
when all the laughter was gone she would listen to the wind rustling 
through the small wood behind the hill. Adults told her to stay away 
from the wood, but she wasn&#39;t scared. There was a peaceful quality to 
the wood that calmed her soul. When she felt she could see the trees in 
her mind she would begin to count the leaves. Listening hard as the cool 
autumn breeze played music with the dying leaves.

A shadow fell over Kris. She hoped it was only a passing cloud, but 
could sense that wasn&#39;t true. A soft  voice gently interrupted the 
girl&#39;s thoughts. &quot;Kristen... Kristen, Recess is over. It is time for 
class.&quot; The voice said. 

Was that her name? She wasn&#39;t sure. With a deep breath she slowly opened 
her eyes and looked up at the large form that stood before her. It was a 
tall, thin woman in a long plain brown dress that hung down to her 
ankles. Kris realized right away that this must be one of the teachers 
from the school on the other side of the playground.  

The teacher spoke again. &quot;Did you not hear the bell, dear?&quot; The girl 
just stared for a moment blinking at the teacher with her sad blue eyes. 
She looked as if any moment now she would begin to cry. &quot;Are you 
alright, dear?&quot; The teacher started to reach out for the child to help 
her up when suddenly the child moved out of the teacher&#39;s reach, 
brushing off the grass from her jeans. Then without a word, turned and 
slowly walked towards the school. 

Each step felt like her shoes were filling with lead. Kris didn&#39;t like 
school. It wasn&#39;t that she wasn&#39;t smart, far from it, the only class she 
wasn&#39;t doing well in was reading and that was only because she didn&#39;t 
like to read out loud. She just found it hard to speak in the first 
place, so reading out loud was hard on her, however that wasn&#39;t the real 
reason she didn&#39;t like school. The real reason was because of all the 
other kids. All the laughter and smiles made her feel uneasy. 

She was always told she should smile more, however in spite of 
everything she couldn&#39;t think of any reason to smile. To her, the future 
was filled with nothing but darkness and pain. All she could think of 
was, that when the final bell rang, she would be sent back to the 
nightmare called home.

As Kris walked down the long hall to her classroom she looked down at 
her tiny hands. There was a long cut down the middle of her left palm. 
She traced a finger along the center of the freshly healing wound. She 
could feel a few tingles, but not much more. It had been a long time 
since she remembered what pain felt like. She used to not be able to 
handle any amount of pain, however over time she found that, just like 
the laughter, she could shut off the pain. 

The cut was caused by herself. The other day she got a splinter of wood 
in her palm. Not wanting to bother her parents, she dug the sliver out 
herself. However it broke off in the middle of her hand and she was 
having trouble pulling the piece of wood free. For a Christmas present 
she was given a science kit with tweezers, scalpel and more. There was 
no pain at all as she sliced the scalpel deep into the palm of her hand 
until she found the splinter and dug it out. Her parents didn&#39;t even 
seem to notice the bandage when they saw her briefly for dinner. The 
teachers were so used to her showing up with wounds that they stopped 
asking how it happened and just let her be. 

Kris looked up from her palm to find herself standing at the entrance to 
her class. None of the classrooms had any doors and were only divided by 
thin wooden walls encircling a small library. Outside of the class was a 
wall of hooks with a child&#39;s name over each one. She found the hook with 
the name she was given and hung up her jacket before going back to the 
door of the class. 

At first she just stood in the doorway looking upon the world inside. 
Class had not started just yet so most of the children were not at their 
seats. They were chatting with friends about the things they did during 
lunch break and what they planned to do after school let out. The desks 
were arranged in a &quot;c&quot; shape facing in and around a grand desk that sat 
in front of a large chalk board. The door that Kris stood in was located 
in the back corner. There was only one long narrow window in the room 
located in the far opposite corner next to the chalkboard. Clouds could 
be seen building up in the sky through the window. 

Kris wished she could be outside with the autumn air lapping at her 
skin. No one approached her or tried to talk to her. For the most part 
they just ignored her presence. They discovered that it wasn&#39;t worth 
their while to try to talk to such a weird girl. She didn&#39;t talk much 
and when she did she was very quiet and sounded like she would break 
into tears at any moment, which she was known to do daily, so they&#39;d 
just rather not get involved. She continued to stand motionless. She was 
very good at this and found that if she stood perfectly still that no 
one would notice her. Well, almost no one. 

&quot;Afternoon Kris.&quot; Came a soft strong voice from behind her. The little 
girl turned around to see a tall man with short dark hair and black 
rimmed glasses. This was Mr. Gish, probably one of the kindest teachers 
in the entire school. Mr. Gish ran into Kris a year ago in the halls. 
She was curled up in a tight ball against a wall, crying.  The teacher 
stopped and asked her to come with him to the teachers office. She was 
scared of him, however found she could not refuse the request so slowly 
followed the man. There he gave her some hot chocolate and helped her 
calm down. Every week since, she would meet him at the teacher&#39;s lounge. 
He promised her that the next year he would make sure she was in his 
class and he did as he promised. This was the only adult that Kris 
trusted, &quot;You going to join us for class today?&quot; He said with a smile, 
&quot;I have a surprise that I think you may like, but I need everyone to be 
in their seat before we can begin.&quot;

The girl slowly nodded, then turned to go to her seat, but noticed a 
group of boys sitting around her desk. She looks up at her teacher and 
almost as if he read her mind he clapped his hands and spoke. &quot;Alright 
everyone to your seats. I have an announcement to make.&quot; Everyone 
suddenly scampered around and got into their proper seats, whispering to 
each other wondering what news their teacher had for them. 

Mr. Gish slowly walked around the outside of the class giving Kris 
enough time to get to her seat before he reached his own. When he got to 
his desk he waited until all the children settled down and then gave 
everyone his trademark smile which even warmed part of Kris&#39;s soul. Only 
when he had everyone&#39;s attention did  he finally speak, &quot;We have a new 
student in our class.&quot; He said to the class, &quot;She should be here any 
moment, but I wanted to tell you all before she gets here. She is kind 
of shy so I want you all to be nice.&quot;

The class suddenly burst into murmurs as the children excitedly talked 
amongst themselves about who this new girl could be.  Kris quietly 
looked from one classmate to another watching them already making plans 
as to who will be friends with this new girl before they even had even 
met her. Then Kris felt something she couldn&#39;t explain, almost as if 
someone was watching her. She turned to see a pair of eyes peering into 
the room. When Kris&#39;s eyes met with the mystery pair they suddenly 
disappeared around the corner. The strange feeling started to get 
stronger and Kris started finding it hard to breath. She felt dizzy and 
her head started to hurt. She grabbed the side of her desk to steady 
herself when she heard the girl sitting next to her speak. &quot;Teacher, I 
think there is something wrong with Kristen again.&quot; The room filled with 
laughter which was quickly silenced by Mr. Gish given the class a quick 
glare. 

He quickly went to Kris&#39;s side. &quot;Kris, are you going to be alright?&quot; She 
looked up at him with glassy eyes. She wasn&#39;t there and Mr. Gish could 
see it. This happened every week and some times were worse then others. 
No one could explain what was happening to the girl and the other 
teachers didn&#39;t want to deal with such a strange child. Mr. Gish, 
however felt there was hope for this girl if he could only reach her. In 
the past few months, he learned that, for one thing, this girl is a lot 
stronger then others take her for. She was fighting something alone that 
few have to face in their entire lives, however there was little he 
could do about it except try to be there for her, &quot;Kris, Listen to me. 
Can you hear me?&quot; He said softly not wanting to frighten the child.

Kris whispered &quot;Water...&quot; Her hands were clenched on the side of her 
desk, her knuckles turning bone white. 

Mr. Gish noticed there was blood under the girl&#39;s hand. He knew he 
shouldn&#39;t touch the girl because he could lose what ever is left of her 
right there. &quot;Go get water, You can go.&quot; He whispered. Everyone watched 
as Kris almost fell out of her chair backwards as if Mr. Gish&#39;s very 
words suddenly cut the mysterious strings that held the girl in place. 
Using the wall to help guide her out of the class and down the hall she 
found her way to the girl&#39;s washroom. These &quot;things&quot; happened so often 
that she could walk the route blindfolded. Actually, in her current 
state of mind she was almost blind. It felt like she was walking through 
water. Everything sounded muffled and looked blurry. She was not willing 
to let whatever this was take hold of her here, not now.

She found the girl&#39;s rest room and stumbled inside towards the sink and 
started to splash water on her face. She didn&#39;t even notice that her 
hand was bleeding and didn&#39;t really care. The cold water cut through her 
like a knife. It was one of the few feelings that she remembers . She 
found out long ago that it helped cut through the fog of her mind and 
shock herself back to reality. 

When she was sure she had both feet in reality she turned off the water 
and prepared to head back to class. It was then that she heard it. At 
first she wasn&#39;t sure what it was. Then the sound came again. The sound 
of someone trying to struggle with a bout of tears. How could she not 
have noticed it before. She turned around to see a young girl, about the 
same age as herself, curled up in the corner staring at her. The girl&#39;s 
eyes were filled with tears and she looked pale. Her long blonde hair 
was neatly brushed except for the part where the girl had run her 
fingers through it.  She was dressed in a little blue dress with long 
sleeves that covered her hands. 

Kris looked at the girl bewildered, something in her eyes struck Kris 
and she couldn&#39;t look away.  Finally she found the will to look away at 
the mirror. Kris&#39;s short curly hair, that surrounded a boyish face, was 
a disaster. Water dripped from curly  bangs that hung in her eyes. She 
hated the way she looked. Her baggy black clothes made her look even 
more like a boy and her eyes were red from tears. Usually she didn&#39;t 
care what she looked like, but for some odd reason she felt embarrassed 
with her looks at that moment, however there was little she could do 
about it now. Using the sinks for balance she walked over to the same 
wall as the girl. She sloped into the opposite corner letting out a deep 
sigh and slid down the wall.

The other girl wiped her tears away and looked at Kris out of curiosity 
and confusion. She then noticed the blood and began to stammer. &quot;Yo.. 
You&#39;re.. You&#39;re bleeding...&quot; She pointed at Kris&#39;s hand.

Kris lifted her hand up to her face to see that the cut had reopened and 
fresh blood was running down her arm. She was too tired to do anything 
about it, so she watched the blood slowly run down her arm under the 
sleeve of her shirt. 

The other girl got up and grabbed a handful of paper towels, soaked them 
in the sink, then grabbed Kris&#39;s hand and started dabbing at the wound. 
Kris didn&#39;t know what to do. Usually when someone touched her she feels 
the need to pull away and hide. But this time it was different. The girl 
continued to hold pressure on Kris&#39;s hand while Kris tried hard to 
figure out if she was dreaming or not. Was she lost in one of her fake 
worlds? She decided to take a test to see and reached up with her other 
hand to touch the girl&#39;s golden hair. The girl pulled her head back, but 
didn&#39;t let go of Kris&#39;s hand. Their eyes met and Kris realized that 
these were the same eyes that were peering into the classroom before she 
had her &quot;episode.&quot;

&quot;You new?&quot; Kris&#39;s voice scared herself as it echoed against the tile 
walls. 

The girl nodded. 

&quot;What is your name?&quot; Kris was shocked to hear herself. She was never 
this talkative with anyone. She took her hand from the girl and held the 
paper towel in place herself. 

The girl nervously brushed her hair over her ear then moved against the 
wall next to Kris, &quot;Jennifer, you?&quot; She asked softly, her voice merely a 
whisper.

Kris thought for a moment &quot;I don&#39;t have a name.&quot; 

The blonde gave Kris an odd look, &quot;How can you not have a name?&quot;

Kris let out a sigh &quot;People say my name is Kristen, but I&#39;m not sure.&quot;

Jennifer looked even more confused &quot;How can&#39;t you be sure? I mean isn&#39;t 
that the name your parents gave you?&quot;

Kris started to stand &quot;If they are my parents.&quot; She tossed the paper 
towel in the garbage and grabbed a clean sheet. 

Jennifer watched Kris carefully fold the paper towel, then place in 
against the wound  &quot;huh?&quot; was all the blonde could say. 

&quot;Never mind, it was nothing. You can call me Kris.&quot; Kris slowly turned 
towards the door and started to leave, then stopped and turned back to 
Jennifer, &quot;You coming?&quot; She asked with a nod towards the door.

Jennifer quickly stood up and followed closely behind her new found 
friend.
