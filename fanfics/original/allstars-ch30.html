5:05 pm

&quot;Next!&quot;

Fencing practice opened with an excellent victory, a strike against the 
quarte and then another on the tierce, with hardly any time at all for 
the opponent to react. The second challenger lunged too quickly, 
striking well but leaving himself open; his opponent made capital out of 
this behavior and struck not twice, but thrice, ending with a 
reprimanding tap on the mask.

&quot;Next!&quot;

Now she was getting into greater trials. The third fight lasted for at 
least a minute without any clear victor. The two foils slashed, danced, 
and thrust, their masters matching every move perfectly; all activity in 
the school was put on hold so the other students could watch. A hit was 
finally made on the seconde, when the challenger lifted their guard for 
but a second, and victory came on its heels as the champion slashed the 
quinte.

&quot;Next, please!&quot;

The audience applauded greatly as a fourth opponent came...and went.

Rain Howlet took a deep breath, removed her mask, and loosened her 
jacket. Defeating three opponents in a row was usually where she stopped 
her warm-ups, but today, she couldn&#39;t resist adding a forth notch to her 
victories. Those left in her wake were a little shaken; her observers 
were either fearful or starry-eyed. More than a few female fans squealed 
and rushed up to her, offering towels and water bottles, hoping just to 
brush their fingers against her brilliance. Even Fitzgerald looked on 
with renewed approval. Rain had every right to be proud; she had 
redeemed herself from her earlier neglect and was now back in her 
groove.

&quot;You were wonderful, Miss Howlet! Four in a row? That&#39;s a record for 
you! Will you marry me, Rain? You&#39;re an inspiration, Miss Howlet! I&#39;ve 
warmed up this towel just for you! Here, this mineral water is much 
better for you than this other junk. Hey, I was a Howlet fan long before 
you! Can I have your autograph?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t crowd me, girls,&quot; she chuckled. Rain sat down on a bench and 
fanned herself, then made sure to stretch to keep herself limber. 
Whew... After drying off and taking a few sips, she was joined by her 
mentor and coach, who glanced down in satisfaction.

&quot;Your performance is excellent- far better, in fact, than I was 
expecting. It seems my doubts about your commitment have been put to 
rest. We can approach the regionals quite confidently this year.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t put all your hopes on me, sir,&quot; Rain smiled humbly. &quot;Humbert and 
Straik have been exemplary, and Price has improved more than me. Still, 
I have to admit that whatever I&#39;m doing, it&#39;s paying off.&quot;

&quot;That it is. Continue this performance and we will be well set to take 
the championship. Just do not forget to rest. There are only two days 
left.&quot;

&quot;I know. Um, Mr. Fitzgerald, just out of curiosity, will you be watching 
the other big game on Saturday?&quot;

&quot;You mean the men&#39;s and women&#39;s football games against Turing and 
Lovelace? Of course. I&#39;d like to bear witness to their results. The 
men&#39;s team has proven itself beyond my expectations, but I&#39;d still like 
to see how they fare against Turing University. As for the women&#39;s...&quot; 
He adjusted his glasses, and even though he was a civil man not prone to 
irrational emotion, Rain could tell he was warding away a smile. &quot;Time 
shall tell, shall it not? A pity I shall miss a majority of it, but this 
comes first. I trust you will not...run out of me again.&quot;

&quot;Whatever would I do that for?&quot; she smiled. &quot;I&#39;ll just catch the results 
later. This is where I belong.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to hear that,&quot; he smiled. &quot;Get back to your training once 
you&#39;ve rested. And square off against Price. I would like to see just 
how much he&#39;s improved.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir.&quot; After a few more minutes, Rain buttoned her jacket, donned 
her mask, and walked over to Price to challenge him. She was a warrior 
poised for greatness; by this time Saturday, she would have the glory 
she had worked so hard to earn.

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;On the Road to Lovelace&quot;

 

Fridays mean a lot of things to a lot of people, but for the fifteen 
women on Carnegie&#39;s soccer team, Friday signified either a beginning or 
an end, a change in their brief sports lives and perhaps a change in 
their lives as a whole- that last barrier between general innocence, and 
total commitment- or total failure. As soon as classes were over, the 
players would board a bus and take a journey to another city, where the 
final practice match would be held to determine their fate. Last week, 
the men had proved their worth in a surprising but narrow victory over 
Anolis, 3-2 after a grueling game and an intense tie-breaking penalty 
shot. They had less to fear in this next match, for they were guaranteed 
to stay regardless of the outcome, but the future was not so certain for 
the women, who dreaded and fretted over tomorrow&#39;s fateful match. The 
hours trudged lazily as they waited for classes to end, each tick of the 
clock adding another knot in the stomach and stealing away one last 
opportunity for peace. It was the most exciting and most agitating 
moment yet.

In addition, there was a regional fencing meeting being held the same 
day in the same city, mere miles away. Fitzgerald and Rain would 
naturally be in attendance; he planned on catching the last half of the 
soccer game once he had some free time. Rain&#39;s matches would overlap 
most of the game, but Fitzgerald promised to &quot;be there&quot; for her during 
her most critical trials. She might have had an attention deficit 
disorder, a tendency for rebelliousness, and a fondness for that other 
team, but she would keep her devotion and repay her teacher for all his 
efforts. She would work wonders. She would finally make him proud.

&quot;Bullshit!&quot; Lauren exclaimed as she heard Rain&#39;s speech. &quot;After how he 
treated you, you&#39;re gonna side with that prick? Unbe-fucking-lievable.&quot;

&quot;You guys don&#39;t understand,&quot; she said. Rain had slowly gotten better 
acquainted with the team, enough to meet them for lunch or walk with 
them to their next class, despite their conflicting personal interests. 
She had grown fond of many of them and even loved a few. Therefore, she 
felt she could be more honest with them- more, but not completely. &quot;He 
might be an A-hole, but Fitzgerald brought me to where I am today. My 
parents got me through the door but Fitzgerald was the one who pushed 
me. He believed in me and he stuck by me even when I felt like crying, 
or quitting, or staying home in bed. I know he seems cold, but he 
actually does care. I&#39;m a valuable investment to him and he doesn&#39;t want 
to see his efforts go down the drain. It&#39;s the same with you all and 
Leena.&quot;

&quot;Not even!&quot; Valencia exclaimed defensively. &quot;Leena&#39;s a sweet, caring 
person; Fitzgerald is just...&quot; She muttered something in Spanish which 
would&#39;ve made her parents blush.

&quot;I didn&#39;t say they were the same; they just use the same methods. 
They&#39;re both very strict and very fair. He had every right to rebuke me 
when I ran out to watch your game. It would be like you abandoning your 
fashion designs,&quot; she said to Valencia, &quot;and you leaving an important 
psychology test.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d do it for my friends,&quot; Lauren snorted. &quot;People&#39;re more important 
than some test, or a game.&quot;

&quot;Look, I don&#39;t even know why we&#39;re arguing about this. I&#39;ll come by once 
my match is over and watch what I can. It&#39;s the least I can do. Just 
because my teacher doesn&#39;t like your team, that doesn&#39;t mean I feel the 
same! I&#39;m on your side, okay? I want you to win. Just give me my liberty 
and I&#39;ll give you yours.&quot;

&quot;That seems fair enough.&quot; Rain looked up and saw Freya waving at her. 
They shared a class together, so of course she overheard a little. &quot;As 
long as you try to make it, we&#39;ll be happy. And even if you can&#39;t, we&#39;ll 
be sure to tell you all about it.&quot;

&quot;Believe me, I wish I could see all of it. And I wish you all could come 
to some of my meetings.&quot;

&quot;Terra would probably like to go,&quot; Lauren muttered as she scratched her 
head. &quot;Is there gonne be...uh, whaddya call it? Not fencing, but...that 
Japanese thing with sticks.&quot;

&quot;Kendo,&quot; Freya said.

&quot;Right, that. She&#39;d get a boner for that shit.&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s strictly a fencing meet, although I hear some of the 
contestants had kendo training. Anybody ever hear of Ancelin Yi?&quot; 
Everybody shook their heads no. &quot;Well, she won the nationals two years 
in a row, and she&#39;s come back to reclaim her title. What about Mihoshi 
Kagure?&quot;

&quot;Oh, do you mean Yuki Kagure?&quot; Freya exclaimed. &quot;I know her! She and 
Shiki were close friends before we moved here. She&#39;s tough. I mean, 
she&#39;s a really cute and sweet person, but I don&#39;t think Shiki&#39;s ever 
beaten her. Of course, Yuki&#39;s never beaten her either...&quot; Rain nodded.

&quot;She&#39;s the one that took Yi&#39;s title away from her, and she&#39;ll be there, 
too, along with at least five other people that could wipe the floor 
with me if I&#39;m not careful. So we&#39;re both up against strong odds. I need 
your support just as much as you need mine. Couldn&#39;t you send that 
Essylt chick? You don&#39;t need her, right? I mean, she&#39;s not an athlete.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not a screamer either,&quot; Lauren grumbled. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t be able to 
hear her.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but I could flirt,&quot; she pouted.

&quot;She&#39;s straight.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s never stopped me before.&quot; Freya suddenly cleared her throat: the 
instructor was approaching and class would soon begin.

&quot;As fascinating as this conversation is, Rain darling, we should really, 
um...&quot; She made several impatient gestures and stepped inside, assuming 
her classmate would do the same. Rain glanced innocently at her friends 
and groaned.

&quot;Damn. Rotten timing. Hey look, I&#39;ll catch you princesses later, but try 
not to think too poorly of me for my choices. I used to be an enormous 
wreck before Fitzgerald took me under his wing. Now I&#39;m only a small 
wreck. See ya!&quot; Lauren and Valencia waved at her, exchanged glances, and 
headed off for their own classes before they could be counted late.

All things must pass, and this includes class. The day eventually wore 
down enough so that school closed and people rushed out to enjoy their 
weekend- but there would be no holiday for the soccer teams. Warren and 
Bracton were already organizing and loading their boys: they waved at 
their sisters-in-arms and wished them luck. Kathlyn was mysteriously 
absent from the lineup as Leena stood before the bus, clipboard in hand. 
She offered no further explanation other than Kathlyn had to &quot;do things&quot; 
and she couldn&#39;t make it.

&quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; Lauren sighed. She had a crush on the older woman; she 
couldn&#39;t help it.

&quot;Well, Curly and Larry couldn&#39;t make it eithah,&quot; Shannon said, pointing 
to Freya. Just as she said, Shiki and Maria were nowhere in sight.

&quot;We only had enough money to send the sixteen of us,&quot; Leena said. 
&quot;Speaking of which, you&#39;re all going to have to share hotel rooms, so I 
may as well tell you your living arrangements.&quot;

&quot;What? Aww! No fair! Can&#39;t we pick who we want to be with?&quot; Leena 
expected them to protest and was prepared for it.

&quot;There&#39;s not enough in the budget to give you individual rooms, and if I 
let you choose who you wanted to stay with, I know you would probably 
stay up late and not rest properly. Besides, this is a good chance for 
you to get to know some of the people outside your circle. I drew your 
names in random order to make it as fair as possible, so if you don&#39;t 
like who you&#39;re living with, just wait for the next away game. Threal, 
Andre, Nazario, you&#39;re rooming with me. Don&#39;t groan; you should be so 
lucky. I&#39;m better than any alarm clock.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s faih,&quot; Shannons shrugged. She liked Jennifer, and as long 
as the Coach was there, Fausta would behave herself. Jen and Fausta 
actually liked the idea of sharing quarters with their Coach, though for 
very different reasons.

Leena continued: &quot;Berkeley, Hawthorne, Ofdensen, Tu, you&#39;re rooming 
together.&quot;

&quot;Aw, sweet! I got all the cool people!&quot; Lauren grinned and put her arms 
around Elisa and Alice. &quot;Dude, did somebody just say &#39;best road trip 
ever&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Fleur snorted. Lauren stuck her tongue out.

&quot;Shut up, I love these people. Me and three sexy women in the same room? 
Ain&#39;t no better thang!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you approve,&quot; Leena muttered wryly. &quot;Next up: Hohenheim, 
Beckett, Nguyen, Khovansky.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fun,&quot; Freya said. She and Nadia grinned at each other; Kasumi 
looked a little worried.

&quot;Oh hell, this can&#39;t be good. All that energy in the same room? At least 
I&#39;ll have you to balance that out.&quot;

&quot;D-don&#39;t be so s-s-sure,&quot; Amy murmured. &quot;I k-kind of have th-th-this 
thing w-with sugar.&quot;

&quot;Awesome!&quot; Nadia squealed. &quot;We must feeding you with the pixie sticks! 
See Amy go fun!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll be expected to have all lights out by 9:30, so no sugar,&quot; Leena 
warned sternly. &quot;The rest of you will be together in the same room. I&#39;d 
advise you to sit next to your roommates while on the bus so you can get 
all your chatter and conflicts out of the way. We&#39;ll eat dinner on the 
way, so don&#39;t worry about food, and we&#39;ll have a light breakfast in the 
morning. Our game&#39;s being held at one o&#39;clock tomorrow, so I want 
everyone relaxed and ready. The bus ride will take us about two hours, 
so I hope you brought something to keep you busy.&quot;

Felicity, Valencia, Fleur, and Arina looked at each other, more or less 
satisfied with the arrangement. Valencia had wanted to be with Kasumi, 
but understood how that could be a distraction. Fleur didn&#39;t care for 
Valencia&#39;s cheer, but she liked the other two; however, Felicity had 
changed a lot since the last game, and more people were noticing it as 
time progressed. Arina, as always, accepted the decision quietly.

&quot;How&#39;s your foot?&quot; Valencia asked as everyone started boarding the bus. 
Fleur revolved it and tapped her ankle firmly.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t feel perfect, but the doctors say I should be fine. What 
about your hands? Are they ready?&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; she breathed nervously. &quot;I&#39;ve been practicing a lot.&quot;

&quot;If you can&#39;t do it, you know who we&#39;ll have to replace you with,&quot; she 
warned. Lauren was flirting with her roommates and didn&#39;t hear a word. 
Valencia appeared confident in her abilities but just as confident in 
Lauren&#39;s. There was no fear of &quot;being replaced&quot; in her eyes. She decided 
to sit next to Felicity and offered her a smile.

&quot;Nervous?&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?! I&#39;m excited! I can&#39;t wait!&quot;

&quot;Whoa, really?&quot; This definitely wasn&#39;t the same woman Valencia knew. The 
old Felicity would have sighed glumly and shrugged her neighbor off. She 
certainly wouldn&#39;t sound so positive. For awhile she wondered if 
Felicity had been captured by aliens and replaced with a clone.

&quot;I can&#39;t wait either!&quot; Jennifer exclaimed. Of course, nobody knew about 
her wager with Robin, so her outburst was just as confusing. Regardless 
of their feelings, everyone except Fleur cheered when the bus started 
rolling, and chatter exploded. Some girls even started singing, and soon 
the whole bus was alive with music.

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they&#39;re a modern Stone Age family!

From the town of Bedrock, they&#39;re a place right out of history!

Let&#39;s ride with the family down the street, through the courtesy of 
Fred&#39;s two feet!

When you&#39;re with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, you&#39;ll 
have a good time, we&#39;ll have a gay old time!

Flintstones, meet the Flintstones, they&#39;re a modern Stone Age family!

From the town of Bedrock, they&#39;re a place right out of history!

Some day, maybe Fred will win the fight! Then that cat will stay out for 
the night!

When you&#39;re with the Flintstones, have a yabba-dabba-doo time, you&#39;ll 
have a good time, you&#39;ll have a gay old time! You&#39;ll have a gay old 
time!

&quot;WILMAAAAAA!!!&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;s this about your sugar?&quot; Kasumi asked. Amy smirked.

&quot;I s-sort of have a p-p-problem with it.&quot;

&quot;You diabetic?&quot;

&quot;N-no... Y-you know how kids g-get hyper if th-they eat too m-m-much? I 
get sugar r-r-rushes too.&quot;

&quot;Oh jeez, seriously? You don&#39;t strike me as the type. I mean, you&#39;re 
always so quiet and private...&quot;

&quot;I have m-m-my reasons. J-just try n-not to give me too m-m-much sugar.&quot;

&quot;That shouldn&#39;t be much of a problem with our diet,&quot; Kasumi replied. 
Freya and Nadia were yammering like jackhammers; it was a wonder they 
could understand each other. The thought of those two people together in 
the same room, one bouncing off the walls and the other trying to follow 
in spite of her health, was a fairly unsettling thought- and then there 
was Amy with her sugar rushes! Kasumi was afraid she had been put with 
the wrong group.

Of course, what she didn&#39;t realize was that Freya was moody, private, 
and fairly antisocial outside of familiar circles, and using so much 
energy came at a great expense. She also didn&#39;t know that Nadia&#39;s 
perkiness was merely a defensive measure against a dark history: it was 
her way of being secretive, so that nobody would suspect how horribly 
insecure, nervous, and shaken she was. Kasumi had problems of her own, 
too: we all put up defensive fronts. The barrier around our hearts is 
designed to keep people away, for fear that being vulnerable, even for 
an instant, will destroy us. Human beings are cruel, fragile, selfish, 
stupid people, and oftentimes the stronger you act on the outside, the 
more delicate your heart is. The secrets, lies, and tragedies traveling 
with them on that bus would flatten any resolve if left naked. Perhaps 
in this regard, Jennifer really was the most exceptional out of them 
all. She had nothing to fear and nothing to be ashamed about, except for 
her own mediocrity, and if that was all that held her down, then she was 
better off than the lot of them.

midfielder-

 

It was the team captain&#39;s duty to board the bus first, and Fitzgerald&#39;s 
to board it last, and somewhere in between was Rain Howlet- not quite a 
star, but certainly a wunderkind. Since everybody boarded alphabetically 
and Rain&#39;s name came fairly early in the list, she had her choice of 
seats and sat next to a window on the left side. She watched numbly as 
the other students came on: Price, Kurtz, Diaz, Fairchild, Brooks, 
Merisan... In spite of her accomplishments and Fitzgerald&#39;s investment 
in her talents, she was disregarded by her peers and viewed as little 
more than a hanger-on. Rain was pessimistic most of the time, but she 
was also a realist: she knew they had nothing personal against her, and 
even if it was something as petty as jealousy, there were at least three 
people on the team who were better than her, and maybe four who were on 
her level (Fitzgerald didn&#39;t have any &quot;average&quot; students). They ignored 
her simply because they had other concerns besides befriending her, and 
their own decisions about where to sit, and who to sit next to. Odds 
were that Rain would be with someone completely random, someone that 
didn&#39;t necessarily desire to be with her, but chose it simply because it 
was the first seat available. Nothing to complain about.

&quot;Could I sit here, please?&quot; Rain looked up and noticed Price standing in 
the aisle, and gestured so he&#39;d get out of the way. Rain didn&#39;t know 
anybody on the team she could really call a friend. She got along with 
most of them, and even chatted when she (or they) was in the mood, but 
she wasn&#39;t close enough to anyone to care. The thought that &quot;things 
would be different if you were with that other team&quot; crossed her mind, 
but she dismissed it. This was her path and she wanted to stick to it. 
Fencing had been one of the few activities her parents suggested that 
she actually liked: it kept her focused, in excellent shape, gave her 
goals, and put her in constant contact with other people. The team might 
not have been as close as she liked, but this was generally the best 
thing that had happened to her, and she had her patient mentor to thank 
for it.

&quot;All right, we are all here.&quot; Fitzgerald appeared at the doorway, 
glancing down the bus to double-check his count. &quot;We shall be underway 
momentarily. Since you all are adults, I trust you will behave as such, 
and not cause me any embarrassment, nor the driver any strife. We will 
arrive at the city in about two hours, so feel free to recreate quietly 
until then. Also, be sure your rooming arrangements are correct. If you 
fail to report any mistakes, you will have to live with them while we 
are up there. Are there any questions? ...Very well, then. You may 
proceed when ready, driver.&quot; Fitzgerald took his place at the front of 
the bus, apparently content to sit by himself. Price took a deep breath 
and crossed his arms.

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you brought something to do, Howlet.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have any books, if that&#39;s what you mean. Dyslexia.&quot; All lies. 
No way was she trusting him to handle the Trinity Blood manga she bought 
at Parody.

&quot;Portable games, then?&quot; A light went off in Rain&#39;s head, and she dug 
through the carry-on she had brought. Jen had loaned her a Game Boy DS 
with some games just for this trip; she kept a PSP for herself.

&quot;Enjoy,&quot; she said, handing them to him. &quot;But be careful. That belongs to 
a friend.&quot; Not necessarily a true statement, but at that moment, with 
everyone carelessly chatting away as if their neighbors didn&#39;t even 
exist, and Rain as another face in the crowd despite her talents and 
quirks, her acquaintance Jen sounded like the best friend in the world.

Admit it: you&#39;d rather be with them.

But there&#39;s nothing I can do about it. I&#39;m here, now, by my own 
choosing.

But you do want to be with them. They&#39;re much more fun than this bunch.

Rain felt her heart wrenching. Damned conscience.

 

With Price hogging the game and everyone else wrapped in their own tiny 
world, Rain felt abnormally lonesome. This was not a new feeling for 
her- she thought she had gotten used to empty lunch tables, activity 
groups, playgrounds, therapy sessions, and classrooms. The so-called 
group dynamic of fencing had been all for me and me for all, with people 
only cheering and supporting if you caused the team to advance. Rain had 
thought that was how things always went, and this grim outlook was what 
had attracted Fleur to her side.

Ah, Fleur! Ironically, she was the one who delivered Rain to something 
new and exciting, a different world where people greeted her by name, 
smiled at her, walked with her to class, played with her, and even 
flirted (Alice and Lauren were one thing, but Valencia and Odessa?). 
&quot;Having never felt alive until...&quot; sounded clich&eacute;, but after tasting the 
fruits of real friends and real interaction, Rain could not abide these 
bland, ordinary people. They were not bad and they were not stupid, but 
they seemed lifeless and even meaningless. Even her legion of fans was 
little more than a cluster of vapid, starry-eyed, fickle airheads, 
swearing allegiance to whatever was &quot;in&quot; at the moment. Rain wondered 
how they would feel towards her if she drastically lost. And how would 
the soccer team react in the same situation? Damn. Thinking about it 
made her feel worse.

&quot;Price, are you done yet?&quot; she groaned. He was intently focused on the 
game- just like a boy.

&quot;I just started! Gimme a minute.&quot; Rain checked her watch and sighed in 
frustration. She looked out the window, looked back at her watch, and 
elbowed him. &quot;I&#39;m serious, man. We&#39;re almost there. Just find a place 
and save it.&quot;

&quot;Okay, god! Thanks for letting me have it.&quot; He returned it sourly; Rain 
took a deep breath and stowed it in her bag.

&quot;I only asked for it back since we&#39;re almost- &quot;

&quot;Fine, whatever makes you happy,&quot; he murmured. What a baby! Just because 
she defeated him three times at practice today...

&quot;What&#39;s your problem?&quot; she snorted. An icy silence wedged between them 
and stayed there as the bus slowed down, swerved into a parking lot, and 
opened its doors with an exhausted hiss.

&quot;About time,&quot; Diaz grumbled. &quot;Two hours my ass!&quot; Rain snickered and 
waited for Price to move. The captain, being the captain, would be the 
last one out. It was still light outside when they emerged, standing 
awkwardly and anxiously before their hotel. Fitzgerald went over the 
rules and regulations for hotel conduct, not that many of these 
thoroughbreds needed to hear them, and herded them inside so they could 
check in. The ladies would have one floor to themselves, while the men 
had another, with five rooms each. Unlike Leena and her tightening 
soccer budget, Fitzgerald could afford two people to a room- not that it 
was an improvement. Rain felt a little less isolated with one other 
person in the room: Brooks was a decent enough human being, but she was 
fairly colorless even compared to the others, and went to bed early, 
asking that Rain not disturb her. She had to play her DS in another 
room, with the volume turned down, cursing to herself as she repaired 
the damage Price did to Jen&#39;s save file.

&quot;Uh-oh,&quot; Jennifer said as Leena unlocked the door. &quot;I sense a 
disturbance in the Force, as if a voice suddenly cried out &#39;oh crap&#39;.&quot;

&quot;The hell?&quot; Shannon grimaced.

&quot;Forget it. It&#39;s a nerd thing.&quot; Leena turned on the lights and set her 
belongings down next to one of the beds. There were only two, so that 
meant they had to share.

&quot;We have about two hours before we need to turn in, so do whatever you 
feel you have to. I&#39;ll be going around the other rooms at 9:30 to make 
sure their lights are out.&quot;

&quot;Will we be waking up at six o&#39;clock again for our ritual?&quot; Fausta 
asked.

&quot;Yes. Lovelace&#39;s field is a few miles from here, so we&#39;ll use the bus. 
After that we can eat breakfast, but don&#39;t load up. I don&#39;t want anybody 
slowing down on me.&quot;

&quot;And after the game?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she smiled gently, &quot;I suppose no matter what the outcome, you 
all deserve to have some fun. I&#39;ll take you someplace nice before we go 
home.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m taking my showah now,&quot; Shannon announced as she headed for the 
bathroom. There was only one, so they would have to take turns. As for 
sleeping arrangements, Shannon said she didn&#39;t mind sharing a bed with 
Jen: it was Fausta she didn&#39;t trust. Jennifer was engaged with her PSP 
for the rest of the day while Fausta took out a book and Leena went into 
another room to use her cell phone.

Meanwhile, Nadia and Freya had stripped down to their underwear and 
started a pillow fight, so Kasumi had to scramble to hide all the 
breakable objects. Amy stood mesmerized as two gorgeous, half-naked 
women squealed, wrestled, and fought, and felt her stomach churn as they 
asked her to join them.

&quot;But you have to undress,&quot; Freya pointed. &quot;It&#39;s the rule. Bra and 
panties only.&quot;

&quot;I love this game,&quot; Nadia purred- although she would have loved it even 
more if Felicity and Elisa were playing!

&quot;Und-d-dress? W-why?&quot;

&quot;Because it&#39;s the rule!&quot; Freya smiled and was about to lift Amy&#39;s shirt 
over her arms when she stopped herself and realized what she was doing. 
Playing with Nadia like this was one thing, but she once had a crush on 
Amy, and it would mean something entirely different. She hadn&#39;t even 
realized this until just now, but Amy certainly remembered, and she 
backed off bashfully.

&quot;Whah? What iz thiz? Why you not show pretty Amy body? I bet you are 
being most gorgeous lady and could defeat evil Freya with ultra pillow 
bomber.&quot;

&quot;Nadia,&quot; Freya said, and she dipped into an elementary Russian she 
picked up while studying abroad. &quot;[It is not good for her and me to be 
this way. We had falling out. It is big story.]&quot;

&quot;[Don&#39;t you like Amy? I like her. Come on- ] Sorry,&quot; she said, reverting 
to English very suddenly, &quot;I have been confused by change. Want to play? 
Kazoome, play?&quot;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; she muttered. She wore a sports bra and boxers: girly 
undergarments weren&#39;t her style. Nadia giggled and swatted her behind, 
then bopped her with a pillow. Freya sat down, put an oversized shirt 
on, and invited Amy to sit near her so they could talk.

&quot;You know, with everything that&#39;s been going on, I almost forgot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she murmured, glancing at Freya&#39;s face. &quot;I&#39;ve s-sort of 
f-f-forgotten ab-bout it as w-w-well. Are you f-f-feeling all right?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, you mean after that incident at the hospital? No, I&#39;m okay. I 
just can&#39;t cheer as loud as I want to, but you&#39;ll do fine.&quot; Amy smirked 
proudly, an expression that was, quite frankly, unusually sexy. She 
looked like a tough kid from the street but spoke like an adolescent, an 
odd combination to say the least.

&quot;Y-you know it. I&#39;ve n-n-never lost before. Hey.&quot; Amy touched Freya&#39;s 
face and leaned in to kiss her cheek. &quot;R-really, don&#39;t w-w-worry ab-bout 
me. I...feel like...I can...trust you.&quot; Obviously this had a deeper 
implication than Freya realized, but she wouldn&#39;t know about it for 
awhile. Amy undressed, almost right in front of her (Nadia was right 
about her being gorgeous), and took up two pillows, wielding them like 
nunchucks. &quot;D-don&#39;t sit like a b-b-bump on a l-l-log, Freya! I n-n-need 
your help!&quot;

&quot;Oh! Yes ma&#39;am!&quot; Freya stripped and jumped on Kasumi; Amy tackled Nadia 
and the four of them battled each other until they were left breathless 
and exhausted. They could barely move, even to turn the lights out, but 
somehow managed and settled in for a rather rewarding rest. Kasumi, for 
her part, was glad to be proven wrong.

 

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Lauren groaned as Leena knocked on their door. &quot;Just when it 
was getting good!&quot; Alice smirked cattily and fastened her bra back. She 
didn&#39;t know how things had evolved to strip poker. One minute Lauren was 
being her usual goofy self, suggesting they play cards, keeping the 
games nice and friendly- but the next, she had pushed the more risqu&eacute; 
version around. Elisa and Terra both backed out, but Alice decided to go 
along: she wanted to be included, and she was actually having a lot of 
fun. She was also down to her underwear and losing badly, though Lauren 
couldn&#39;t tell if it was on purpose or not. She just had her socks and 
holey jeans taken, and was disappointed that the game ended so 
prematurely.

&quot;And that&#39;s why you shouldn&#39;t gamble,&quot; Elisa pointed.

&quot;You got it wrong, Berkeley!&quot; Lauren grinned. &quot;This is why people 
should! Hey, you don&#39;t have to put your clothes back, you know. We&#39;re 
all girls here. I sleep naked all the time.&quot;

&quot;Please abstain for today at least,&quot; Elisa sighed. She didn&#39;t trust 
herself with the other women and so asked Terra to share her bed. Terra 
knew Elisa had a girlfriend, but couldn&#39;t help but stare at how lovely 
she looked, especially in her nightgown. She slept silently and 
beautifully, wheezing very softly and groaning happily, like a baby 
might. Lauren and Alice were giggling, wrestling, and laughing in the 
bed; they&#39;d probably be zombies come the morning. Tu sighed and tried to 
shut her eyes, but Elisa tossed in her sleep, draping an arm around her 
back, and scooted closer to cuddle with the mysterious object.

&quot;Mmm...goodnight, Mr. Coconut.&quot;

Terra&#39;s eyes opened with a start. What the hell...?

 

&quot;And you&#39;re sure you&#39;re okay?&quot; Arina smiled sweetly at Fleur; they were 
sharing the same bed since neither Felicity nor Valencia wanted to spend 
the night with her. Lacroix sighed and rolled her eyes.

&quot;For the last time, yes! Why are you always on my case?&quot;

&quot;Because I like you,&quot; Arina answered. She reached out to touch Fleur&#39;s 
face, and giggled eerily.

&quot;Um, okaaayyy... Do you want to have sex or something? Is that it?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be absurd,&quot; she answered quietly, sounding a little offended. &quot;My 
sex life involves men, but my intellectual life encompasses everybody. 
When two people become close like this, others always assume that sex is 
a part of their relationship.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say we&#39;re close.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to think we are.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re weird,&quot; Fleur grumbled, &quot;even for me.&quot;

&quot;But you like me, don&#39;t you?&quot; Lacroix raised her eyebrow, puzzled, and 
decided to end the discussion right then and there. She pulled Arina&#39;s 
face close and kissed her squarely on the mouth.

&quot;Let&#39;s just say that I would have said yes, but...since you don&#39;t want 
to...&quot;

&quot;You misinterpreted me,&quot; Essylt sighed, wiping her mouth. Fleur giggled 
and turned her around so they could spoon. Arina smelled fantastic and 
she was as soft and warm as a fur coat.

&quot;I&#39;m just fucking with you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of.&quot; Fleur laughed and squeezed Arina gently.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re not curious. Not you. Not a psychologist.&quot;

&quot;Pipe down,&quot; Valencia groaned. &quot;Some of us are trying to sleep.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, seriously,&quot; Felicity mumbled. Arina giggled.

&quot;Darling, let me rest for a moment. I can evaluate you another time.&quot;

&quot;And who says courtship is dead?&quot; Fleur murmured.
