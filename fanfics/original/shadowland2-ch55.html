<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch54.html">Back to Part 54</a><pre>Kris pushed off the exterior wall of the Western Dorm; she had been 
listening in on the commotion inside through a lobby window near the 
front door. When Amy started pushing Jessica to return to her nightmare 
she had decided that she had heard enough. She stomped across the 
Academy ground to her Aunt&#39;s home where she entered without so much as a 
knocking. The house was dark and silent, if Kris did not know better she 
would have thought it were destitute for years. She took off her shoes 
before venturing further into the house. 

&quot;I am in here Kris.&quot; Sophia&#39;s voice weakly drifted down the hall. 

Kris slowly crept towards the living room to find it filled with the 
soft glow of the fireplace. Sophia sat upon her high back chair staring 
at the flames, a long distraught look upon her face. She appeared to 
have aged many years in the past few hours, her skin was beginning to 
droop around the corners of her mouth and her eyes were sinking into her 
skull, &quot;Aunt Sophia, are you alright?&quot; Kris inquired disturbed by her 
Aunt sudden change of appearance. 

Sophia&#39;s eyes slowly moved from the firelight to her niece&#39;s face and 
gave her a small weak smile, &quot;It has been a long day and it is causing a 
strain on my powers to hold this world together.&quot; She explained then 
patted the chair next to her, &quot;Come sit. I&#39;m sorry to say, but Missy is 
not in the shape to get you some hot cocoa.&quot; 

Kris cautiously did as she was told not able to take her eyes off her 
withering aunt, &quot;What is going on?&quot; She anxiously inquired, &quot;It is as if 
everything is crumbling around me.&quot; 

Sophia gave a single slow nod and pointed to the flames before them, &quot;I 
have been watching.&quot; She remarked sadly. 

Kris turned to gaze upon the flickering flames, before her images formed 
upon the firelight. She could see the lobby of the Western Dorms with 
the girl&#39;s huddled over Kim, Kima and Jessica, then the image rippled to 
show Tanya in the cafeteria, red-eyed and crying. Next was an image of 
Cherilyn sitting upon her new bed with a photo of Tanya in hand, tears 
streaming down her cheeks, &quot;I want to help them.&quot; Kris exclaimed as the 
images hovered before her eyes, &quot;Tell me how to help them?&quot; She 
demanded, glaring at her aunt. 

Sophia reached out and lightly patted Kris&#39;s hand, &quot;There is such fire 
in that heart of yours. You would dive into the pit of Nightmares itself 
if it meant helping your friends, would you not?&quot; She remarked with a 
look of shame in her eyes, &quot;I have always admired that about you.&quot; 

&quot;It will also be the death of her one of these days.&quot; Gwen commented as 
she stepped out of the shadows beside the fireplace. 

Kris leapt to her feet at the sight of her sister, &quot;Gwen!&quot; She exclaimed 
happily, grateful to see her sister again, &quot;I need to go back into the 
Dream Realm. My friends are in trouble and I need to save them.&quot; 

Gwen shook her head, &quot;I can not allow that.&quot; She stated unfortunately. 

Rage filled Kris, &quot;Why not?!?&quot; She roared and grabbed her sister by the 
front of her blazer, &quot;You allowed me to help Jenn so why don&#39;t you let 
me help Jessie?&quot; She demanded. 

Gwen set her calm eyes upon Kris&#39;s, &quot;First it was Jenn and now it is 
Jessica. Dear sister, can you not make up your mind?&quot; Gwen inquired 
nonchalantly, &quot;You cannot have them both to yourself you know?&quot; 

The fire in Kris&#39;s eyes began to fade as sadness and confusion filled 
them, &quot;But... I... I can&#39;t...&quot; She stammered, &quot;Jessie needs me right 
now. I can&#39;t just leave her like that.&quot; 

&quot;Does she really need you?&quot; Sophia inquired lightly, &quot;Or is it you that 
needs her?&quot; 

Kris staggered away from her relatives, rubbing at her head in 
frustrations, &quot;J... Jenn does not love me anymore...&quot; She chocked back a 
sob, &quot;All I wanted was to be there for her and I screwed up. Now she 
hates me. Why could I not keep my emotions under control, like you 
Gwen?&quot; 

Gwen let out a deep sigh, &quot;You were always more human then Angel.&quot; She 
remarked downheartedly, &quot;I knew father should not have forced you to 
become one of us.&quot; 

&quot;More human?&quot; Kris blinked in confusion, &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; 

Gwen glanced at Sophia who lightly closed her eyes and leaned back in 
her chair, not uttering a single syllable. 

&quot;I&#39;m tired of these mind game.&quot; Kris growled, realizing that she was not 
going to get any more out of these two, &quot;If you will not help me then 
I&#39;ll find someone else.&quot; She stormed out of the room and slammed the 
door behind her. 

Gwen peeked through the heavy dark curtains of the living room window 
and watched her little sister run across the school ground, &quot;Should I go 
after her?&quot; She inquired in the darkness of the room. 

&quot;Leave her be.&quot; Sophia weakly replied, not moving from her chair, &quot;She 
needs to work things out for herself for once. You can not always be 
watching over her, you know that do you not?&quot; 

Gwen let out a sign of defeat and let the curtains fall back in place, 
blocking out the afternoon sun, &quot;I know... I just wish there was more I 
can do to help her. She is all alone out here.&quot; 

Sophia gave the angel an unsteady smile, &quot;That girl is far from alone. 
She will find her way. You will see.&quot; Her eyes shifted back to the 
fireplace, &quot;And she will need you again soon. You just have to wait for 
the right moment.&quot;
