face. She lays up in bed and places the palm of her left hand to her 
forehead. &quot;The same nightmare... again? I really should stop watching 
horror movies late at night&quot;

Feeling like all her energy had drain out from her, she glances out of 
her window to see the sun light pouring through her window and birds 
soaring through the sky. She remembers what today is.

&quot;My birthday!&quot;

Asuka leaps to get out of bed but loses balance as the blanket is still 
wrapped around one of her legs causing her to fall.

&quot;Etaii...&quot;

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Mion places both of her hands on her hips as she stares up happily at 
the work she has done. A long &quot;Happy 17th Birthday Asuka!&quot; cloth is hung 
along one of the dojo&#39;s wall with a fair amount of different colored 
balloons floating up to the ceiling and a few on the floor. A large 
table was laid out with two presents and a large course meal spread out.

&quot;What do you think Sayuri?&quot; Mion said with a grin. &quot;Well?&quot;

Mion turns around as her friend doesn&#39;t say a word and sees Sayuri 
standing out at the walk way staring at the sky. Wondering what has 
gotten her friend into such a state, she walks out to her.

&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot;

&quot;The sky...&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot; Mion gazes up at the sky &quot;What about it?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not clear anymore... just an hour ago the sun was beaming down on 
us like it was summer. No clouds even.&quot; Sayuri said frowning &quot;Now...it 
looks almost as if a large storm is coming...the whole sky looks like 
some giant black hole or something.&quot;

The image of her friend&#39;s bloody figure flashes in Mion&#39;s eyes as she 
glances as her friend and shakes her head. Biting her bottom lip, she 
forces a smile and holds the side of her friend&#39;s shirt.

&quot;Come on, don&#39;t worry about the weather, let&#39;s go inside. Asuka should 
be coming you know.&quot;

Sayuri stares at her friend for a second, sensing the worry in her. 
Smiling reassuringly, Sayuri walks with her friend inside the living 
room. As their back turn around from the gate, a lightning bolt flashes 
revealing a shadow figure standing at the front gate...with a large 
smile on its face then vanishes as lightning disperse.

-30 minutes later-

&quot;What&#39;s with this weather?&quot; Asuka thought as she rushes down the street 
to her friend&#39;s house.&quot;Seems a bit familiar..dejavu like..&quot; Sighting the 
large wooden gate, she opens the door and sees the dojo&#39;s light on.  
Smiling, she rushes through the yard towards dojo and slides the wooden 
covered doors to the side.

A loud snap and popping sound startles her as she jumps back to find 
confetti flying in the air.

&quot;Happy 17th birthday Asuka-san!&quot;

Tears begin to well up in Asuka&#39;s eyes as she embraces both of her 
friends in her arms.

&quot;I knew you&#39;d do something for me,&quot; she said with a bright smile.

&quot;Heh, sure you did,&quot; Sayuri said laughing &quot;But you thought we were only 
gonna take you to the movies and that&#39;s it.&quot;

Mion smiles warmly. &quot;Well, we still are later if you&#39;d like.&quot;

Asuka releases both of her friends. &quot;Of course, lets! Now let&#39;s hurry 
and eat some food before it goes cold.&quot;

For the next hour the friends playfully joke around as they eat and talk 
until Sayuri finally brings out the birthday cake.

&quot;Make sure to make a wish before you blow the candles,&quot; Sayuri said with 
a snicker &quot;You tend to rush things quickly and forget to do things...&quot;

Mion laughs and playfully hits Sayuri&#39;s arm. &quot;Don&#39;t mind her, go ahead 
and make a wish.&quot; she said to Asuka

&quot;A wish huh...&quot; Asuka said tilting her head to the side as she ponders 
about it. &quot;Not sure what...&quot;

&quot;How &#39;bout, finding true love?&quot; Mion asks

&quot;Are you sure? I think even if she wished that, Kami-sama wouldn&#39;t be 
willing to give her one &#39;cuz she&#39;s been doing nothing but bad pranks 
this year.&quot; Sayuri said with a chuckle &quot;I&#39;m kidding, go on, you may wish 
on that if you like.&quot;

Asuka jokingly sticks out her tongue at Sayuri then grins as she turns 
her attention to the cake. Clasping her hands together, she wishes to 
find true love and then blows the candle.

Right at that moment, as if on cue, the electricity in the house cuts 
off as thunder and lightning crash outside.

&quot;Kiyahh! What in the world?&quot; Asuka yelps out latching onto the side of 
Sayuri&#39;s arm while Mion holding the other one.

Sayuri grits her teeth as her eyes scan around the room. Suddenly she 
notices a presence lingering outside the household. Quickly she snaps 
her body around and snatches a red sheathed katana that was hung on the 
wall. Rushing towards the living room sliding doors, she slams the door 
to the side as the girls still cling on her arm. Another lightning bolt 
flashes in the background and a large thunder erupt in the sky as the 
Asuka and Mion stare in horror into the eyes of a man with white hair 
menacing eyes standing on the wall. Wearing an ordinary black Japanese 
school uniform, the man smiles as the Sayuri steps takes a step forward 
to him.

&quot;Oh~? Welcoming me already?&quot; the man grinned &quot;Happy 17th birthday by the 
way .. Priestess...of the Seven Gods.&quot;

A shiver shot up Asuka&#39;s spine as he utters the last words.

&quot;You... what&#39;s your business here.&quot; Sayuri asks coldly as rain begins to 
pour

&quot;The Priestess... of course.&quot;

The man smirks as he hops down to the grass. Immediately after having 
his first foot hit the ground he dashes towards them in a demon-like 
speed. Surprised, Sayuri pulls away from the two girls and rushes 
towards the intruder with sword in hand.  The man dodges to the side as 
Sayuri does a gatotsu (a fast forward stabbing move). Easily maneuvering 
to the side, she spins around as she does a side slash as the man 
quickly leaps in the air.

&quot;Ho? Quite fast, if you had possessed powers you would probably be a 
formidable opponent.&quot; The man lands on the stone wall. Reaching out his 
hand, Sayuri&#39;s eyes shot open knowing his intentions and rushes towards 
the girls. A large invisible burst of energy launches out from the man&#39;s 
hand aiming straight at the two girls.

Asuka and Mion watches in slow motion as Sayuri pushes them down and is 
shot in the back from the energy that sent her flying 20 feet across the 
dojo and into the wall. Sayuri yells out in pain as she feels her ribs 
crack and  falls to the ground from a crater size dent in the wall.

&quot;Sayuri!!&quot; Mion and Asuka yells out in horror. Quickly both of them rush 
towards their friend and Mion pulls Sayuri&#39;s upper body to lay on her 
lap and clasp her hands on her friend&#39;s face.

&quot;Omg no... please don&#39;t die on us...&quot;  Mion said as tears stream down 
her face.

Asuka wipes the tears off her cheeks as she turns around angrily to see 
the man walking towards the dojo.

&quot;My my... how heroic.&quot; the man said shaking his head and making a 
tsk-tsk noise. &quot;Come now Priestess, unless you want more people-&quot;

A large energy ball heads towards the man and he crosses his arms in 
front of him as he is flies back 10 feet, leaving 2 long trail marks on 
the ground from the force.

&quot;Who in the world?&quot; He looks at his arm to see the sleeves on his arms 
where he had blocked had been burnt to pieces and his arms slightly 
burned. He looks back up at the dojo.

Asuka blinks and sees the back of a guy facing her. His legs were spread 
wide apart as if in a defense position and arms up ready to fight.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; she asks

The guy turns his head to look at her over his shoulder and smiles. 
&quot;Your knight of course,&quot; he jokes</pre>
