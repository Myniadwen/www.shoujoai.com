Prologue

A long old steam locomotive slowly pulled into the station during the 
dead of the night, with its string of old wooden passenger cars in tow. 
The few travellers that dared coming out so late at night, haunting the 
platforms, did not seem to notice as a small cloaked passenger that 
disembarked from the back car as they tried to find the best seats. The 
figure casually moved through the halls of the train station, the moon 
shining through large domes of glass that canopied overhead, held 
together with a spider&#39;s web of iron and glass. She swiftly moved up the 
marble staircase and through the spiralling doors to the outside world. 
The individual lifted its head to look up at its new surroundings. Light 
from an overhead streetlight, made of case iron and hanging upon long 
black chains from posts, cast down on the being revealing the small 
round face of a young girl, the right side of her face covered in 
twisting black flames of a tattoo that extended down from her shadowed 
eyes and along the side of her neck. She softly closed her eyes and 
breathed in the cool night air, &quot;I&#39;m finally back.&quot; She muttered to 
herself as a small smile played across her face, revealing a set of 
fangs that glistened in the light. Abruptly she spun around to face the 
lights of Whispering Hills Academy off in the distance and quickly the 
smile was replaced by a frown as she recalled the true reason she was 
there. Rapidly, the girl moved through the night with her destination in 
mind, winding her way through the small down and up the large hill in 
which the school sat, looming overhead.
