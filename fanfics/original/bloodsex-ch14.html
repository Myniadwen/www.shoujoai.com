<h1>Blood, Sex, and Magik (part 14 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>There are things that we see in the city that we
ignore or simply dismiss out of hand. The large dog
that padded up the back alley was mistaken as a dog by
some, possibly even a coyote, but the few men or women
who saw it that night realized what it really was. A
wolf walked the streets that night, though thankfully
one that was only partially driven by it&#39;s wilder
instincts.

Scent and hazy memory guided the tawny haired beast on
it&#39;s way up the alley, muzzle and paws still spotted
red with blood. It reached the shadows nearby the
building and whimpered deep in it&#39;s throat, a almost
pitiful sound. With a shudder it twisted, body
shifting, lengthening as fur was rapidly absorbed into
the growing form. Hind legs stretched out into human
limbs, the midsection shifting even as the muzzle drew
in, a short mane of fur growing out into long hair.

&quot;Oh damn it,&quot; the brown haired young woman looked at
her blood stained hands and groaned, &quot;looks like I ate
a cat again.&quot;

Skin almost unnaturally pale the brown haired woman
looked around warily then stumbled tiredly to the side
door. With the ease of long practice she felt along
the top of the frame for the key hidden there then
unlocked the door before staggering inside. Ignoring
everything else she crossed to the bathroom there in
the basement, roughtly washing her hands first then
her face.

&quot;Tooth paste, where the hell....&quot; she muttered,
searching the battered medicine cabinet before finding
it. The taste of mint didn&#39;t wash the blood from her
mouth but at least it blunted the metalic tang, along
with a full cap full of mouthwash. Still nude she
walked right into the shower, grimacing at the
rattling pipes as she got the hot water going.

The shower felt heavenly as she scrubbed away the
residue of spending a night haunting the alleys and
back streets of the city. When that time of the month
finally came an unnatural restlessness drove her
outside, haunting this demon and monster infested
city, all the while careful to avoid the worse class
of hunter.

A few minutes later wearing a green robe and looking a
lot neater the young lady walked up the stairs,
entering onto the ground floor of the old three story
brown stone. &quot;I&#39;m back,&quot; she called out in warning as
she headed for the kitchen, smiling as she caught the
scent of coffee on the air.

&quot;Rose,&quot; he looked up with a little smile as she
entered, the older man sitting there at the kitchen
table with a half finished box of donuts, &quot;morning.&quot;
His clothes consisted of a wrinkled business suit, all
in basic black much like his thinning hair.

&quot;Hey Tom,&quot; she strode by him and went right for the
coffee pot, pouring out a cup and shuddering as she
drank about half of it down black. Much more leasurely
Rose refilled the cup, adding cream and sugar as she
commented, &quot;Quiet night.&quot;

&quot;At least you don&#39;t have any wounds,&quot; Tom noted. &quot;Did
that crazy with the silver bullets try to come after
you again?&quot;

Rose chuckled darkly, &quot;No, I think I scared him enough
not to try it again.&quot;

&quot;Do any hunting?&quot; Tom asked curiously.

A bit sheepishly Rose admitted, &quot;I ate another stray
cat, damn it.&quot; With a certain amount of irritability
she got a cream filled donut and griped, &quot;Do you have
any idea how hard it is to get short fur like that out
of your teeth?&quot;

&quot;I thankfully haven&#39;t had to deal with that problem,&quot;
Tom said with a certain amount of amusement. A bit
more seriously he added, &quot;You up to some tracking?&quot;


&quot;My nose isn&#39;t as reliable as normal on the nights
around the full moon,&quot; Rose said with a shrug, &quot;but
yeah, I think I can manage.&quot;

&quot;The angency has a new missing person&#39;s case,&quot; Tom
drank some of his coffee, &quot;one that conventional means
aren&#39;t working for.&quot;

&quot;I owe you,&quot; Rose said crisply, &quot;ask and I&#39;m ready.&quot;

Tom snorted laughter, &quot;You are way too melodramatic,
you know that?&quot; He got up and added a bit more gently,
&quot;You work for me, that&#39;s it.&quot;

Watching Tom leave the room Rose smiled to herself and
thought, &#39;It&#39;s not that simple for me, and you should
know it.&quot;

Picking up her coffee and another donut Rose left the
kitchen and went back to her bedroom, munching away
happily. After pulling on underwear she went digging
through her closet to find the right business drag,
skirt, blouse and matching coat and swiftly dressed.
Makeup, tying her long hair back and she was ready for
her day.

&quot;What&#39;s a nice wolf like me doing in a place like
this?&quot; Rose softly asked herself as she locked the
front door, traces of Tom&#39;s scent still lingering.
Giving her partner at the detective agency a key to
her home for when she shifted had been a good idea,
but she didn&#39;t like being in his debt any deeper than
she already was.

Trails of scent wafted in the air, men, animals and
things that were neither. Machines roared along the
roads, airplanes soared above and the remains odf an
industrial society lingered all around. The world was
a riot of scent along with all the colors her eyes
could detect, a wave of information that was very
nearly overwhelming.

&quot;Miss Rose!&quot; a cheerful voice called and she had to
stifle her irritation. The bouncy blonde soon caught
up, looking like some actress or model in her tight
mini-skirt and tight white blouse.

&quot;Kim,&quot; Rose nodded unenthusiastically.

&quot;Aww, don&#39;t be like that,&quot; Kim took her arm, the
overabundance of perfume the woman wore wafting
forward like a toxic cloud.

&#39;Oh lord...&#39; Rose did her best not to choke, the smell
was so strong. &quot;I&#39;m on my way to work,&quot; she managed,
forcing a bit of distance between them.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why you don&#39;t like me,&quot; Kim pouted
cutely, but she did let Rose slip away from her a
little.

&#39;Gee, the fact that you stink hasn&#39;t fully
registered?&#39; Rose thought but instead said, &quot;It&#39;s not
that I don&#39;t like you, it&#39;s just that I&#39;m busy.&quot;

Kim shook her head, stopping to watch Rose walk away.
&quot;Then I look forward to the day you&#39;re not busy,&quot; she
said with a smile.

&#39;Maybe I can douse her with a fire hose accidentally?&#39;
Rose mused as she strode off down the street. She
shook her head, &#39;Nah, even that wouldn&#39;t do it.&#39;

The office was in an older building, one that stadled
the edge of what was thought of the bad side of town.
The highrise had clearly seen better days, the once
elegant facade fallen into disrepair, but the price
was right and the place suited their business. With
the elevator our, again, Rose took the stairs, smiling
slightly as she strode up the hall to Yamazaki
Investigations.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you don&#39;t go out with her,&quot; Tom
griped. Having been dateless himself ther past few
weeks, he was a bit annoyed at Rose&#39;s having to fend
off eligable girls.

&quot;Considering I&#39;d have to wear a gas mask to date her,
it doesn&#39;t seem feasable,&quot; Rose replied, taking off
her coat and hanging it up in the outer office. She
looked over at Tom sittying on the edge of the
secretary&#39;s desk, &quot;Is the old man in?&quot;

&quot;Old man?&quot; the indignant voice asked.

Rose smiled, having tagged their boss by scent long
before she entered the room. &quot;Good morning,&quot; she
turned, studying the woman there with a smile.

Lucy Yamazaki stood casually in the doorway to her
private office, her business suit clinging to her
body. Full breasts pressed against her pure white
blouse, the dark blue skirt hugging legs that almost
seemed to go for miles. Full glossy lips matched her
dark red hair, her scent earthy and warm.

Few people knew Lucy&#39;s real background, only the
hundred stories that circled around her. A former
government agent? Retired spook? Foreign freedom
fighter? Those and many more had been speculated on,
but all everyone knew was that she had appeared ten
years ago with a lot of money, a investigator&#39;s
licence and started up the agency.

&quot;Rose hasn&#39;t been briefed yet on the latest missing
persons case,&quot; Tom noted as he turned to his own
office with a smile.

&quot;I&#39;ll certainly see to it,&quot; Lucy nodded for Rose to
enter her office then followed inside, shutting and
locking the door behind her.

&quot;You know,&quot; Rose sat on the desk, gasping as Lucy bent
forward to kiss her neck, &quot;you really should get Tom a
raise for giving us such oportunities.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take that under advisement,&quot; Lucy chuckled,
sliding her hands down the front of Rose&#39;s blouse,
gently pulling it open.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rose sighed happily as Lucy licked her breasts,
&quot;you smell wonderful.&quot;</pre>
