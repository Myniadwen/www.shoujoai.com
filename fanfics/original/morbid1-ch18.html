&quot;Your tea is re...ady....&quot; Victoria glanced around her caf&eacute; in shock. 
The circus performers had managed to repair all of the damages in the 
time it took her to prepare tea for the ringmaster. She starred in 
astonishment at the newly refinished front of her shop as she made her 
way over to where the ringmaster sat, &quot;Here... you... go...&quot; She set the 
tea down upon the table, not able to take her eyes off the repairs. The 
entire front half looked exactly as it used too. They even managed to 
restore the tables and chairs, having them arranged as if nothing had 
even happened to the little caf&eacute;. 

&quot;Impressed I see.&quot; Morbius grinned and took a sip of his tea, &quot;Splendid! 
I somehow knew when I saw this place that it would be perfect. Even the 
tea is the finest I have ever drank.&quot; He took another long sip of the 
tea then patted the seat next to himself, &quot;Please take a see, young 
lady.&quot; 

Victoria sat down, still in a daze, &quot;Th.... thank you...&quot; She replied in 
bewilderment, &quot;Is my tea all that brought you here?&quot; She inquired 
curiously. 

&quot;Jacob, could you come here for a moment.&quot; Morbius called out across the 
caf&eacute;. 

&quot;One moment.&quot; The werewolf replied, &quot;I just need to hang Markus up 
first.&quot; He stated as he tossed a rope over one of the ceiling beams in 
the corner and tied it tight, &quot;Is that alright, Markus?&quot; He inquired 
stepping away from his handy work. 

A man hung by a noose at the end of the rope. &quot;This is perfect.&quot; The man 
said, his neck was broken to the side and a guitar was draped over his 
shoulders. He glanced around the room as he slowly turned at the end of 
the rope and smiled, &quot;This place really sings to me. Makes me really 
want to play.&quot; He then strummed his guitar a few times and began to play 
a soft melody that drifted through the entire caf&eacute;. 

Jacob nodded to then walked over to the ringmasters table, &quot;You call for 
me Mr. Morbray?&quot; He inquired when he got to the table. 

&quot;Victoria, this is Jacob.&quot; Morbius introduced, &quot;He is a werewolf 
mystic.&quot;

&quot;There is a man hanging in the corner playing the guitar...&quot; Victoria 
stated still in a daze. 

&quot;That would be Markus.&quot; Morbius explained, &quot;As you can tell we are not 
of this world. We are in search of something.&quot; 

&quot;Mr. Morbray,&quot; The werewolf interrupted, &quot;I do not think she can hear 
you.&quot;

Jacob could not have been more right. Victoria suddenly broke into 
maniacally giggles that made everyone in the caf&eacute; stop and stare, &quot;There 
is a man hanging in the corner of my caf&eacute; singing!!!&quot; She laughed.

&quot;You are sure the book will still be in your room?&quot; Maria inquired 
impatiently as she pulled a dark cloak over her head and stepped through 
a servant&#39;s entrance on her way to an awaiting carriage.  

&quot;If The Raven&#39;s Keep is still there.&quot; Jamie remarked anxiously from 
between Maria&#39;s arms, &quot;Has your mother been planning to make a living 
teddy bear for a long time?&quot; She inquired looking over the little cloak 
that Anita had a fixed around her neck only moments before. 

&quot;Hard to tell.&quot; Maria replied, &quot;But knowing mother she probably had an 
entire wardrobe specially made just for you.&quot;

Jamie let out a sigh, &quot;I thought as much.&quot; 

&quot;It is very cute.&quot; Amanda stated smiling at the teddy bear as she pulled 
her cloak over her head, &quot;I wish my teddies had so many clothes to 
choose from.&quot; 

&quot;I still can not believe she had a cloak for your body.&quot; Maria commented 
with a shudder as she turned to look upon the headless corpse. The cloak 
in reference appeared like any other, however it had wires around the 
edge of the hood that held it up to make it seem as if there was a head 
within and a porcelain mask hung over the front so no one would peer 
within, &quot;She seems to be prepared for every eventuality.&quot; She remarked 
with a shake of her head. 

&quot;My ladies.&quot; Anita opened the carriage door for the group of girls, &quot;The 
driver has been informed of the situation. We should make haste before 
we are noticed.&quot;

The driver took a bow, &quot;It will be an honour to escort you young ladies 
and I will ensure that you make it to town unharmed.&quot; He stated 
confidently. 

&quot;Please try to not harm the townsfolk either if you please.&quot; Maria 
politely ordered as she climbed into the carriage. 

&quot;I will be sure of it, my lady.&quot; The driver replied with a bow. 

&quot;I will make sure he does them no harm.&quot; Anita informed her mistress as 
she helped Maria into the coach. 

Anita helped everyone inside and when they were all seated she closing 
the door and climbing up into her spot beside the driver above the 
transport and with a crack of the reins the group were on their way. As 
planned Clara invited the townsfolk into their home to search for any 
living dead that were rumoured to be there, meanwhile the girls circled 
around the back and headed to town while everyone was too busy searching 
the castle. The girls peeked out as the carriage as it wove its way 
through the town&#39;s street. 

&quot;I have to be imagining this.&quot; Maria commented as they passed a small 
group of undead sipping tea on a restaurant patio and yet another 
discussing the town&#39;s newspaper, &quot;I never thought dead people would act 
like this.&quot;

&quot;How did you think they would act?&quot; Jamie inquired curiously, &quot;I mean we 
are acting just like we normally would...&quot; She glanced at herself then 
to her body, &quot;Well sort of anyway...&quot; 

&quot;Mother taught me all about death when I was very young.&quot; Maria 
explained, not able to turn from the window, &quot;The body starts to stiffen 
and rot over time. Their brains should be decayed and nonexistent so how 
are they able to move or talk?&quot; She nodded out at an undead man reading 
a book, &quot;That man is almost skeletal. He probably does not even have 
eyes. None of this makes any sense at all.&quot; 

&quot;What ever happened to your interest in the supernatural and the 
unexplained?&quot; Amanda inquired apprehensively. 

&quot;I do not know.&quot; Maria sighed and sat back in her seat, &quot;When it was 
just the three of us it was interesting and unique. It sort of made me 
feel kind of special and now...&quot; 

Jamie glanced into her lover&#39;s eyes, &quot;You are still special. You will 
always be the girl I love.&quot; She remarked. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; Maria rubbed at her eyes, &quot;But what will happen when we 
stop all of this? Will you and Amanda disappear? Will I remain alone or 
will I die along with you? Are we really doing the right thing by 
stopping all of this?&quot;

Jamie thought for a moment, &quot;I have thought about that too since I 
realize that it might have been that book that brought us all back to 
life. For now I think we just try to find out what this cloud is about 
and figure out the rest later.&quot; 

Amanda nodded, &quot;I feel there is a reason that I was brought to be with 
you today.&quot; She stated firmly, &quot;I do not think anything will separate 
us. It is destiny that brought us together on this day and she is not 
one to separate us so quickly after we were brought together.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I hope you are correct.&quot; Maria remarked with dismal sigh. 

*****

Across town Mrs. Olaf sat upon her favourite rocking chair on the porch. 
A grin spread across her withered old face as she watched the dark 
clouds circling overhead. Macbeth lazily flopped his tail against the 
hard wood porch as Mrs. Olaf stroked the top of his head. She was 
certain that her plans had succeeded and soon she would rise to her 
rightful spot as Lady of Holland-Greystoke again. No, not 
Holland-Greystoke, the town&#39;s name would have to change, it would be the 
Olaf Township. Her grin broadened at the prospect when she was jarred 
from her dreams by the voice of her niece. 

&quot;Auntie!!!&quot; Alice called out as she leapt out of the forest and sprinted 
across the field with her friend in tow. 

&quot;Alice?&quot; The old woman stood up, &quot;Alice where have you bee-&quot; All of a 
sudden Cecil stumbled out of the forest. 

&quot;Come back here.&quot; He snarls. Bits of the flesh around his wounded eye 
had been pulled away by tree branches as he plowed through the forest 
after the girls and he was holding a hand over the gaping hole in his 
side as his internal organ tried to free themselves from their confides.  
Already part of his intestine was dangling against his leg, bouncing 
with every step the boy made, &quot;I will kill all of you.&quot; He hissed 
angrily as he staggered across the field. 

&quot;Will you just give up?&quot; Alice demanded, &quot;Go back to where you came from 
would you?&quot; She pleaded. 

&quot;Cecil?&quot; Mrs. Olaf squinted at the boy, &quot;What happened to you? You look 
like you have been to hell and back boy.&quot; 

&quot;No thanks to these girl.&quot; Cecil pointed the stub of his hand at the 
three girls who were now hiding behind Mrs. Olaf, &quot;I have returned to 
get my revenge on them. If they would only stay still for a moment.&quot; 

&quot;You expect us to let you kill us?&quot; Alexandra inquired dumbfounded by 
the idea, &quot;You must be daff if you think we are just going to lay there 
and let you stab us or whatever you intended to do. How did you plan to 
kill us anyway? I have not noticed any weapons on you since you 
appeared.&quot; 

Cecil stopped in the middle of the field and thought, &quot;Well... that 
is...&quot; 

&quot;I told you he was stupid.&quot; Alice remarked with a giggle, &quot;He could not 
even stop three little girls from killing him.&quot; 

&quot;Alice!!&quot; Mrs. Olaf glared down at her niece, &quot;What did I tell you about 
killing relatives?&quot; 

&quot;Only to do it upon your orders.&quot; Alice recited indifferently, &quot;But I 
did not kill him. I just... helped bury him...&quot; She explained shyly. 

&quot;Oh, I see.&quot; Mrs. Olaf patted the girl on the head, &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear 
that.&quot;

&quot;What?!?&quot; Cecil exclaimed in astonishment of his aunt&#39;s reaction to his 
death, &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to punish her? Or call for the police or 
something?&quot; He inquired futilely.  

&quot;I never liked you much to begin with Cecil.&quot; Mrs. Olaf stated coldly, 
&quot;So why not return to your grave where you belong and leave these girls 
alone.&quot; 

Cecil snarled with rage, &quot;I am murdered and you expect me to just walk 
away?&quot; He screamed in fury, &quot;I will kill you all if I have to. Maybe 
then you will finally respect me.&quot; He rushed at the porch with all his 
strength. Abruptly Macbeth sprung to life and leapt over the patio 
railing at the boy, &quot;Macbeth wait!! Stop it!!!&quot; The dog landed hard upon 
Cecil forcing him to the ground. His screams filled the air as the dog 
began to hungrily tear at the boy&#39;s intestine. He struggled against the 
old dog but Macbeth snapped its jaws around the boy&#39;s neck and tore his 
head off. Cecil&#39;s head rolled off to the side and he stared in terror as 
the dog feasted on his corpse. 

&quot;Well... that was nasty.&quot; Alexandria commented as she tried to ignore 
Cecil&#39;s pleas for the dog to stop. 

Alison leaned over the edge of the railing to get a better view, &quot;This 
is so neat. I have never got a chance to see someone torn apart. I wish 
it was by wild animals but I guess this is alright.&quot; 

Mrs. Olaf started back into the house, &quot;Do any of you girls want some 
cookies? I just baked a fresh batch.&quot; She invited as she opened the 
door. 

&quot;That is alright, Thank you.&quot; Alexandria declined politely as she 
followed the old woman into the tiny house, &quot;We came because we wanted 
to know a few things.&quot; 

&quot;You wished to inquire about the rising dead, am I correct, Lady 
Alexandria?&quot; The old women asked as she moved around a small table and 
settled into one of the chairs near the fire, &quot;Are you sure you do not 
want a cookie?&quot; She picked up a large round cookie off of a platter and 
held it out to the girl. 

Alexandria glanced at Alice, who shook her head violently, and then 
turned back to the old woman, &quot;That is alright.&quot; Alex declined once 
again. Alice had warned them before hand to not accept anything from her 
Aunt. That the women was known to make many forms of poisonous foods for 
unwelcome guests and would be very persistent about them eating them, 
&quot;How did you know my name? Most people can not tell Alison and myself 
apart.&quot;

&quot;I know many things.&quot; Mrs. Olaf replied with a sinister grin, &quot;I knew 
that you were going to kill my nephew before you even knew who he was. I 
only asked Alice here to find out if she would lie to me. I detest 
liars.&quot; She stated taking a bite of the cookie, &quot;These really are tasty 
you know.&quot; 

&quot;Then you know how to stop all these monsters, Auntie?&quot; Alice inquired 
eagerly. 

&quot;Things are finally set in motion and the Olaf family will take its 
rightful place once again and you wish for me to stop it?&quot; Mrs. Olaf 
asked in dismay, &quot;I thought I taught you better, Child. Do you not wish 
to attain the heights of your friends here?&quot; She pointed a bony finger 
at Alexandria. 

Alice nervously fidgeted with her dress, &quot;I do but... this seems so 
wrong...&quot; She replied tensely. 

Mrs. Olaf raised to her feet, &quot;You ungrateful child.&quot; She glared at the 
girl, causing Alice to back into a corner, &quot;I feed you and cloth you and 
you tell me everything I do for you is unwanted?&quot; She staggered towards 
the girl when her face suddenly turned to terror, as if she had suddenly 
witnessed something truly hideous, worse then a living dead boy being 
torn apart by a dog. 

Alice and Alexandria searched the room for what could have caused the 
woman to be paralysed in such fear, &quot;Is there something wrong, Auntie?&quot; 
Alice asked cautiously. 

&quot;The horror!!!&quot; Mrs. Olaf suddenly screamed, &quot;The nightmare of it 
all!!!&quot; 

Alexandria staggered backwards as the woman started stumbling about the 
room clenching her head, &quot;Mrs. Olaf?&quot; She inquired carefully, unsure if 
she should get to close to woman, &quot;Is there anything we can do to help?&quot; 

Mrs. Olaf collapsed to the ground near the fire, &quot;Those monsters!&quot; She 
cried out in panic, for in her mind&#39;s eye she could see Jamie, Maria, 
Amanda and Anita were approaching the Grimoire and they had a chance of 
ruining all her plans, &quot;They most be stopped.&quot; She exclaimed frantically 
as she reached out to grab something to help her get to her feet. She 
set her hand on the rim of the large caldron she kept over the fire and 
screamed out in pain. The caldron tipped over and poured a mess of 
boiling green goo upon the floor. The mixture rushed around Mrs. Olaf&#39;s 
legs and began to eat away at her clothes, &quot;No!!!&quot; She cried out in 
terror, &quot;This can not be happening!!!&quot; The goo touched the red-hot coals 
of the fire and suddenly the concoction caught a blaze and the flamed 
rushed around the old woman, consuming her. 

The dazzling flames mesmerized Alice as they danced over her Aunt&#39;s 
body, &quot;Isn&#39;t it pretty, Lady Alexandria?&quot; She said with a sigh of 
delight. 

Alex shook her head in dismay, &quot;Come on.&quot; She dragged her friend out of 
the burning building to find her sister still watching as the dog gnawed 
on Cecil&#39;s leg, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; Alexandria commanded her 
sister, &quot;This place was useless.&quot; 

&quot;Awwww, but sis...&quot; Alison protested as her sister grabbed her hand and 
started to pull her away from the house, &quot;I want to watch the doggie.&quot; 
She pouted. 

&quot;Maybe another day.&quot; Alexandria promised half-heartedly, &quot;We are going 
home.&quot; The group of girls headed back towards town. 

&quot;Come back here!!&quot; Cecil cried out, &quot;I will get you!!! You will see.&quot; 
The dog picked up the head and started to take it behind the house, 
&quot;Wait!!! Where are you taking me!!! HELPPP!!!!&quot;
