<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch46.html">Back to Part 46</a><pre>Kris slowly dragged her feet up the Western Dorm&#39;s front stairs and 
pushed through its doors. The moment she entered the lobby she could 
feel the heavy tension that hung in the air. Natalie was the first to 
approach her. 

&quot;Kris? What happened?&quot; Natalie urgently inquired. 

Kris&#39;s eye set upon Jessica curled up against the wall and she shook her 
head dismally, &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it.&quot;

&quot;Did you and Jessica really...?&quot; Natalie began to ask when she saw the 
hurt look in Kris&#39;s eyes, &quot;Oh geez...&quot; Natalie ran a hand through her 
hair.

&quot;Where&#39;s Jenn?&quot; Kris inquired, glancing around the lobby.

&quot;She went to her room with Tanya and Cherilyn.&quot; Natalie explained, &quot;They 
look rather miffed at you.&quot; 

Kris dropped into a nearby couch and covered her face with her hands, 
&quot;She hates me for sure now.&quot; She remarked hopelessly

Amy stepped out of the office with a broom in hand and spotted Kris, 
&quot;Kris!&quot; She leaned the broom against the wall and rushed over to the 
girl, &quot;Are you alright?&quot; She inquired, &quot;I hear things did not go too 
well.&quot; 

&quot;You could say that.&quot; Kris replied with a nervous laugh, &quot;I feel like 
someone just shot me through the heart.&quot;  

&quot;Give her some time.&quot; Natalie assured, &quot;She might turn around.&quot;

&quot;Or she will hate me forever.&quot; Kris remarked placing her hand upon her 
forehead, &quot;And I would not blame her. God if only Carey had not stuck 
her nose in things. I want to strangle that girl.&quot; She stated through 
her clenched teeth.

&quot;Who is Carey anyways?&quot; Natalie inquired sitting next to Kris. 

&quot;She is one of the Sisters of Death.&quot; Amy stated, letting out a deep 
sigh. 

&quot;A Death Sister?&quot; Natalie exclaimed, &quot;What kind of sister would attack 
an innocent girl?&quot;

&quot;There are nine Sisters of Death living in the Hall of Candles.&quot; Amy 
began to explain; &quot;Each is responsible for guiding a certain type of 
soul back to Death&#39;s Corridor. The oldest being Julie, followed by 
Morrigan, then Brenna, Grania, Gwen, Angelina, Kris, Keelia and the 
youngest of them all is Carey. Their father, The Meanderer, determines 
their paths based upon the first ten years of their lives.&quot; She sat down 
upon a couch and noticing she had everyone&#39;s attention continued her 
explanation, &quot;For instance Morrigan is in charge of those that have died 
during wars, while Angelina deals with those who have commit suicide.&quot;

&quot;Geez.&quot; Natalie muttered, &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound like a fun job.&quot; She 
turned to Kris, &quot;What souls were you in charge of?&quot; She inquired 
curiously. 

&quot;Children...&quot; Kris stated dismally. 

Natalie winced, &quot;Hell, how could you handle something like that?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t...&quot; Kris replied sadly, &quot;You just hope that they understand 
before having to take them to their last resting place.&quot; 

Sensing Kris&#39;s distress Amy continued her tale, &quot;Carey was in charge of 
those who died by murderous intent. She dealt with some of the more 
stubborn souls, the ones who are not even aware of their death and would 
fight to stay on earth. Being the youngest Carey understood her role as 
little as the souls she recovered. After a time she started to see death 
as simply a game and souls were points. She started to manipulate people 
and cause them to commit murders for her so she could gain more souls 
then her sisters and did so with malicious delight.&quot;

&quot;A death angel killing people.&quot; Alyson breathed, &quot;Now there is a 
nightmare I would not like to face.&quot; 

&quot;Jenn just did.&quot; Kris remarked flatly, leaning back against the sofa and 
staring at the ceiling, &quot;I should have known she would come after me in 
some manner. I just never thought she would go after Jenn.&quot; 

&quot;Why would she want to hurt you?&quot; Natalie inquired, growing increasingly 
more interested in this tale.  

Kris set her eyes upon Natalie, &quot;Because I was the one who tore off her 
wings and banished her from the Hall of Candles.&quot; She stated coldly. 

Something about the look in Kris&#39;s eyes sent a shiver across Natalie&#39;s 
spine, &quot;Y... you did that to your own sister?&quot; She inquired nervously, 
suddenly worried about getting on Kris&#39;s wrong side.

&quot;She is no sister of mine.&quot; Kris snarled. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t that the same way your family is treating you?&quot; Natalie asked 
cynically, &quot;You treat family like they are disposable.&quot;  

Kris jumped to her feet and towered over Natalie, &quot;She killed people for 
fun. She even tried to kill Jenn, when all I did was fall in love.&quot; She 
growled at the girl, &quot;We are not the same. Never suggest such a thing 
ever again.&quot; 

Amy leapt to her feet and pulled Kris back, &quot;Kris, you need to calm down 
a little.&quot; She ordered.

&quot;Calm down!!&quot; Kris shouted, &quot;How am I supposed to calm down? Jenn is 
nearly murdered and Natalie is accessing me of being the same as her. I 
am nothing like Carey. What about Alyson then?&quot; She pointed at the girl 
angrily, &quot;Her brother helped Carey, does that make her an insane murder 
too?&quot; 

Alyson cringed at the assault and Natalie came to her aid, &quot;Don&#39;t shout 
at her. What&#39;s wrong with you lately?&quot; She asked coldly, &quot;First you 
treat Jenn badly then you start attacking everyone around you. If this 
is how you treat your friends then I don&#39;t want to be one.&quot; 

&quot;Fine!&quot; Kris pushed Amy off and stormed out of the room, &quot;I don&#39;t need 
any of you anyway.&quot; She pushed the door opened with enough force to 
cause it to bang against the wall before slamming shut. 

&quot;Well that didn&#39;t go well.&quot; Amy said, shaking her head. 

&quot;Kris!!&quot; Jessica started after the girl only to have Amy stop her. 

&quot;No, leave her.&quot; Amy dismally instructed, &quot;She needs to cool off first 
before she can think rationally.&quot; Amy rubbed her forehead in distress, 
&quot;I wish Sophia was here...&quot;
