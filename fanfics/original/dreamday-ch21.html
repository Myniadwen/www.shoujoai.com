<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 21 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Kris pushed her way through the crowds, trying to escape the insanity 
before she burst into another bout of tears. Finally she bolted out the 
front doors and into the fresh autumn air. Breathing in the cool air and 
the scent of dried leaves calmed her nerves. She felt a lot better now 
that she had cleared her mind. She wished she could do something for 
Mrs. Brookholds for being there for her today. A smile played across her 
face as she prepared to head home. 

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Kris heard Sarah&#39;s voice yell out just around the 
corner of the school. Kris moved towards the commotion to find out what 
the disturbance was about. Rounding the corner she could see Sarah and 
Jason arguing in the middle of the yard. Sarah&#39;s face was red with  
anger, &quot;Just go away Jason, please. I want to be left alone.&quot; She 
started to turn away from the boy.

&quot;What! You&#39;d rather spend time with that... that thing?!?&quot; Jason pointed 
back at the school, but Kris could feel that he was meaning to point at 
her. 

Sarah spun back around and scowled at the boy, &quot;She is not &#39;a thing&#39; 
she&#39;s my friend.&quot; She defended.

&quot;You two seem closer than friends to me.&quot; Jason snarled, &quot;Is she the 
reason you won&#39;t go to the dance with me?&quot; He interrogate.

Sarah laughed, &quot;I won&#39;t go to the dance with you because I don&#39;t want 
to.&quot; She stood her ground, &quot;We broke up back in junior high, or have you 
forgotten.&quot;

&quot;No, I didn&#39;t forget.&quot; Jason groaned in a low voice, &quot;I thought if we 
were in the same school again you&#39;d change your mind.&quot; 

Sarah shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Jason, but I don&#39;t love you.&quot; She 
turned to walk away again when Jason reached out and grabbed her arm. 
&quot;OUWW!! STOP IT!!&quot; Sarah yelled out in pain.

&quot;Are you telling me that you&#39;d rather be with that tomboy dyke than me, 
is that it?&quot; His eyes bore into the girl. 

Sarah looked down at the ground and whispered so that only Jason could 
hear her answer. Kris strained her ears, however could not hear a word 
the girl said. Jason, however, could hear it all. He started to grind 
his teeth and shake with anger. His grip tightened around Sarah&#39;s arm 
until she screamed out in pain. Kris finally could not stand idly 
watching anymore. Before anyone was aware Kris came out from her hiding 
spot behind Jason and clamped down on his hand in such a way that he had 
to let go of Sarah.

He turned around to see who could have the nerve to interrupt him.  Kris 
stood off to the side with her teeth clenched and eyes burning. Sarah 
never saw that look in her friend&#39;s eye before. When Kris was angry 
everyone could see it in her eyes, however right now it proved more than 
simple anger. Kris acted as if she was ready to kill. Jason turned his 
attention to the small girl and punched her across the face sending Kris 
skidding backwards and down on all fours. Kris looked up at the boy and 
wiped her cheek. The girl&#39;s eyes were now completely fogged over. It was 
almost as if  Kris was no longer there and something else took her 
place. Jason stepped back when his eyes were caught by Kris&#39;s. Without 
any warning the girl leaped forward. Jason tried to block his face, 
instead Kris kicked out low and struck him on the inside of the knees 
causing him
to tumble to the ground. Before he could get back to his feet Kris spun 
around kicking the boy across the back of the head, ending with both of 
her knees landing in the square of his back and rolled off to the side 
staying low to the ground preparing for yet another round of attacks.

Sarah could see that Kris wasn&#39;t going to stop. She noticed in awe that 
Kris was about to jump forward at Jason again. Sarah threw herself at 
the girl and tackled her. The two tumbled to the ground, &quot;KRIS! CALM 
DOWN!!!&quot; Sarah yelled out, trying to reach her friend&#39;s mind, while Kris 
snarled like some kind of animal. Finally, they came to a stop several 
meters away from where Jason lay. Sarah held the flailing girl down with 
all her might. &quot;Kris, Kris calm down.&quot; She continued to call out to her 
friend. Gradually Kris regained her sensed, she blinked her eyes and 
looked at Sarah in bewilderment. Sarah helped the girl to her feet. Kris 
was confused, she remembered walking up to Jason, but nothing else. 

Jason was now standing at his full height again. He looked ever more 
angry than before and began to quickly move towards the girls. Sarah 
stood between him and Kris, who was beginning to shake in fear. &quot;Go away 
Jason.&quot; Sarah demanded. Jason stopped a meter away from where Sarah 
stood. He looked from one girl to the other and glared at Kris, &quot;GO!&quot; 
Sarah commanded with a
harsher tone than before. 

He rubbed the back of his head, &quot;I&#39;ll never understand you.&quot; He said 
defeated then turned and started to walk away. A group of kids that had 
gathered around quickly moved out of the way of the angry boy. 

Kris collapsed to the ground. Her entire body hurt more than ever. Sarah 
reached out and touched Kris on the cheek where Jason had hit her. Kris 
winced from a pain she hadn&#39;t experienced since the days her mother used 
to hit her against the wall. Sarah pulled back, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She said 
staring at the ground.

Kris sat up and spat some blood on the ground, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean for this 
to happen. I thought he was going to hit you so...&quot; She trailed off 
trying hard not to look Sarah in the eyes.

Sarah smiled &quot;So you came to my rescue.&quot; She wiped a tear from her eye. 

Kris examined the girl, &quot;Looks like you were the one doing the rescuing 
and not me.&quot; She carefully got up and tested her legs to make sure they 
weren&#39;t going to give out on her again. 

Sarah helped Kris walk towards where she had dropped her bag, &quot;Does it 
hurt much?&quot; She asked.

Kris bent over to pick up her backpack, then threw it over her shoulder, 
&quot;Not really, I&#39;m used to pain.&quot; She was lying. She was a wimp when it 
came to pain. She was really wishing she could shut it off again, 
however it wasn&#39;t working. She started to walk towards her apartment 
when she stopped, &quot;What time is the dance?&quot; She asked nonchalantly over 
her shoulder. 

Sarah was busily picking up her own books and almost didn&#39;t hear the 
girl, &quot;The dance?&quot; She was confused for a moment and then smiled when 
she realized she was being asked to the dance after all, &quot;Next Friday, 
around 7 pm.&quot; 

Kris waved over her shoulder, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll see you there.&quot; She walked 
away without looking back. 

Sarah watched her friend fade into the distance with a smile on her face 
and hugged her books, then ran off towards her own home.
