<a href="../original/journend-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;Have I ever been in love?&quot; Rachel repeated the
question, the black haired woman blinking in surprise.
She gave the younger girl a curious look, &quot;That&#39;s
pretty personal, considering how little time we&#39;ve
known each other.&quot;

Sam Davis blushed, her long brown ponytail swinging.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the younger woman looked away in
embarrassment, her glasses sliding down slightly.

Rachel looked at her sympathetically, reaching out to
gently push Sam&#39;s glasses in place. &quot;Why do you want
to know?&quot; she asked curiously.

Sam looked down at the ground, a few strands falling
into her face. &quot;I&#39;ve read a lot of romances,&quot; she said
softly, &quot;but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever fallen in love.&quot;

Rachel chuckled, leaning back on the steps. The two of
them were out at Journey&#39;s End, the house on the hill
by the sea, having volunteered to take care of the
place while Nicole was out on a signing tour. Not that
the resident ghost Laura couldn&#39;t manage, but being
intangible much of the time meant there was only so
much she could do.

&quot;I&#39;m no expert,&quot; Rachel said, &quot;I&#39;ve had flings, but
that&#39;s about it.&quot;

Sam hesitated, &quot;Are you... uhm....?&quot;

&quot;Am I a lesbian like Nicole?&quot; Rachel asked gently.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sam blushed again.

&#39;I wonder if this is going where I think it&#39;s going?&#39;
Rachel thought to herself with some amusement. &quot;Yes I
am,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;I hope you&#39;re not going to be
too uncomfortable up here alone with me.&quot;

Sam smiled up at her, &quot;No, it&#39;s all right.&quot; She rested
her chin on her knee, the sun shining down on them as
the breeze stirred the trees nearby. &quot;I read the first
draft of Nicole&#39;s latest book,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;the
lesbian romance.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Rachel smiled, thinking how much she had
enjoyed reading the book, too. A departure from
Nicole&#39;s straight novels it had been both touching and
a bit erotic, about first love and a powerful romance
between young woman.

Sam puffed out a breath as she confessed, &quot;After
reading it.... I found myself wondering if I had ever
fallen in love.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a tough one,&quot; Rachel acknowledged. They sat
out there for a few moments more before she finally
acknowledged why they were sitting there, stalling.
&quot;Do you want to try going inside?&quot; she asked Sam.

&quot;I think I&#39;ve gotten my courage up,&quot; Sam sighed,
standing up and taking a moment to brush the dust off
the bottom of her shorts. With a wry smile she asked,
&quot;Does Laura frighten you as much as she does me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve gotten a bit more used to her,&quot; Rachel got up
too as she confessed, &quot;now she just gives me the
shivers.&quot;

&quot;Gee, I have that to look forward to,&quot; Sam said with a
self-mocking sigh as they walked up to the front door.

Rachel moved to unlock the door but it clicked open on
it&#39;s own, swinging open by a unseen hand. Within was
brightly lit, the inner hall gleaming clean as usual,
probably a direct result of Laura&#39;s efforts. &quot;Uhm,
hello?&quot; Rachel called.

Sam gulped, &quot;Do you think she&#39;s here?&quot;

&quot;Good morning,&quot; the cheerful voice came from right
behind them, making both of them jump with a cry.
Whirling around they saw a blonde haired woman giving
them a faintly amused smile, her old-fashioned dress
swirling around her as if it was being moved by an
unfelt breeze.

&quot;Do you have to do that?!&quot; Rachel blurted out, putting
a hand to her chest right over her wildly beating
heart.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Laura smirked impishly.

Thump!

Both woman and ghost turned sideways to see Sam fall
to the floor in a dead faint. Cursing softly Rachel
knelt beside the girl, checking her pulse and noting
her pale color. Thankfully it seemed the fright had
only knocked the girl out and did no other harm.
Getting one arm behind her head and the other under
her legs Rachel lifted Sam with a grunt, carrying her
into the living room and setting her down on a couch.

&quot;I&#39;m very sorry,&quot; Laura said humbly, &quot;I truly didn&#39;t
think I&#39;d startle her that badly.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Rachel sighed. It wasn&#39;t like Laura
could do much to let people know where she was,
considering she was usually perfectly silent and could
simply appear anywhere in the house that she wanted
to.

Sam groaned softly, blinking as she came awake and
looked around her in confusion. Her eyes widened as
memory rushed back and she winced, &quot;I did it again!&quot;

&quot;Did what again?&quot; Rachel asked as she helped Sam sit
up on the couch. The blood rushing to her face
restored her color pretty quickly, her glasses sliding
down cutely on her nose as she tried to get her
bearings.

&quot;Faint,&quot; Sam sighed, looking over to where Laura
hovered worriedly nearby.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Laura asked softly, looking down at
her with gentle concern on her partially transparent
face.

Still blushing Sam managed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m fine, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&#39;She really is kind of cute,&#39; Rachel found herself
noting with amusement. Looking up at Laura she asked,
&quot;Did Nicole make it out of here okay yesterday?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Laura nodded, something very like a blush
coloring her ethereal cheeks as she remembered what
had happened before Nicole had left. A bit
apologetically she said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry that Nicole made
you agree to two house sit, but I think she&#39;s not
entirely comfortable leaving me here on my own just
yet.&quot;

&#39;Wonder how wild they got before Nicole left?&#39; Rachel
mused naughtily. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she said, &quot;I could
use a few days off.&quot;

Sam got up from the couch, the young woman still
looking a bit sheepish. &quot;Which rooms do you want us to
use?&quot; she asked curiously.

Firmly in her hostess mode Laura smiled charmingly ,
&quot;There&#39;s a guest room upstairs, but I&#39;m sorry to say
we only have one bed.&quot;

Rachel blinked, noting Sam blushing faintly as they
both remembered their conversation outside. &quot;It should
be fine,&quot; she looked around and saw that Laura had
brought their bags in, &quot;why don&#39;t we go up and get
settled?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll see you later then,&quot; and with that Laura simply
faded away.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rachel grabbed her suitcase and led the way
up. &quot;Is this going to be all right?&quot; she asked Sam
softly.

Sam blushed slightly, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; A little frown
as they reached the second floor, &quot;I&#39;m surprised that
she didn&#39;t suggest that one of us take the couch,
tho.&quot;

&quot;Nicole and Laura only admitted they were officially a
couple a little while ago,&quot; Rachel informed her
softly, &quot;I bet they&#39;re trying to matchmake.&quot;

&quot;Matchmake?&quot; Sam squeaked as they entered the spare
bedroom.

Rachel snickered softly, setting her small suitcase by
the bed. &quot;They&#39;re like most couples,&quot; she informed
Sam, &quot;they want to see all of us pesky singles paired
up.&quot;

Sam had the oddest look on her face, &quot;But I&#39;m not even
into girls.&quot;

Rachel sat down on the side of the bed, looking around
her curiously. A large dresser and nightstand was
nearby, as well as a wardrobe off to the side.
&quot;Obviously Nicole hasn&#39;t noticed,&quot; Rachel laughed,
even as she felt a small stab of regret. Sam really
was cute, in a boy-dyke kind of way.

&quot;Does that mean that Laura is going to keep trying
to....&quot; Sam made a smooshing together gesture with her
hands.

Rachel chuckled, &quot;Probably.&quot; She took pity on the
younger woman and added, &quot;I&#39;ll try to run interference
for you, all right?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sam sighed. Under her breath she muttered,
&quot;I didn&#39;t sign up for this.&quot;

Rachel snickered softly, &quot;It could be worse.&quot;

Sam looked curious, &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;They could have tricked you into going with us to
Vancouver to one of the dyke bars or something,&quot;
Rachel said impishly.

Sam blushed, again, &quot;Definitely not what I signed up
for.&quot;</pre>
