<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>Natalie quickly rushed through the halls of the dorm as she led Melissa 
and Amy to Alyson&#39;s room. She was not sure why the Head Mistresses was 
so anxious to see Alyson, but the look in their eyes made Natalie double 
her pace.

Amy leaned close to Melissa, &quot;Is it such a good idea to allow Natalie to 
go ahead of us like this?&quot; She whispered to the head mistress. 

Melissa let out a deep sigh, &quot;She needs to know and she would find out 
eventually.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Amy uneasily watched Natalie&#39;s back. 
								
&quot;Sophia says it is time for her to know.&quot; Melissa explained anxiously. 

&quot;How bad was it?&quot; Amy inquired nervously. 

&quot;Bad.&quot; Melissa stated as they came to the door of Alyson&#39;s room and 
Natalie was about to open it when Melissa grabbed her hand before she 
could touch the knob. Natalie glance up at the Head Mistress perplexed 
by her actions, Melissa simply shook her head and pulled the girl gently 
away from the door. 

Amy approached the door cautiously and knocked lightly on the door, 
&quot;Alyson?&quot; She inquired to the door and waited silently for a reply. 
Where they was none she waved her hand over the knob and there was a 
soft click of the door unlocking. Quickly Amy entered the room and was 
startled by what she saw, &quot;Oh my...&quot; She muttered then rushed to 
Alyson&#39;s side and dropped to the ground. 

&quot;What is wrong?&quot; Natalie cried out as she struggled against Melissa&#39;s 
grip, &quot;What happened to Alyson?&quot; She demanded. 

Melissa knelt next to Natalie and forced the girl to face her, &quot;You can 
go in, but be prepared for what you see. It will not be a pretty sight.&quot; 

Natalie stared at the Head mistress peculiarly, &quot;What are you talking 
about?&quot; She glanced at the doorway to Alyson&#39;s room then back to 
Melissa, &quot;What happened to Alyson?&quot;

&quot;You will understand soon enough.&quot; Melissa explained softly, &quot;What ever 
you do, don&#39;t blame yourself.&quot; She slowly let go of Natalie&#39;s arm, 
allowing the bewildered girl to go on her way. Melissa sat on the ground 
across from the room and watched as Natalie quickly rushed into the 
room, &quot;I hope this is the right thing to do, sis.&quot; She mumbled to 
herself. 

The moment Natalie entered every ounce of life seemed to drain from her. 
In the middle of the room she saw Alyson, she appeared to have fallen 
from her desk chair and was lying extremely still. There was a pool of 
blood forming around one of her legs, her arm was twisted at a painful 
angle and there was a dark bruise upon her forehead. Amy was already 
cutting away at the girl&#39;s pant leg revealing three deep holes in the 
flesh of Alyson&#39;s thigh, just like the dagger wounds that Natalie had 
done to Drake.  Natalie dropped to her knees as she watched Amy quickly 
began to mend her lover&#39;s injuries, injuries that Natalie had only 
moments ago inflicted upon the girl&#39;s brother.

&quot;No...&quot; Natalie shook her head in disbelief as she backed slowly out of 
the room, &quot;Why...?&quot;  

&quot;She didn&#39;t want to worry you.&quot; Melissa explained gently from her spot 
on the ground.

Natalie spun around to face the Head Mistress, &quot;You knew all this time?&quot; 
She questioned frantically, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me?&quot; She demanded, 
tears overflowing her eyes and pouring down her cheeks.

&quot;It is not our place too.&quot; Melissa explained as she watched the girl 
begin to tremble. 

&quot;I did that to her...&quot; Natalie mumbled darkly. 

&quot;You are not to blame.&quot; Melissa soothed. 

&quot;Yes I am!&quot; Natalie shouted, &quot;She was always waking up with bruises and 
cuts.&quot; She explained tearfully, &quot;She said she was just like me, but I 
should have seen it before I just blocked it out.&quot; She turned and ran 
down the hall, &quot;It&#39;s all my fault.&quot; She cried.
