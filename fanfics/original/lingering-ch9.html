<a href="../original/lingering-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The rain has come again. I can hear it tapping upon the rooftop, tap tap 
tapping upon the windowpane, gently urging me to awaken from my slumber. 
A flash of lightening floods the room, a light so bright that it turns 
the backs of my eyelids a bright red and leavings me with the last 
eminence of coloured lights as I slowly crawl my way through the 
doldrums of the recent nights dreams. Dreams of darkness and claws that 
reached out to take hold of my leg as it hangs over the edge of my bed, 
dangling ever so precariously out from under the sheets from which it 
was safe. 

Now half awake I feel long nails slowly slip around my ankle, my mind 
pictures reptilian hands attached to long yellow nails that lightly 
graze my bare skin, sneaking further up my leg to get a better grip. My 
body is paralysed in fear of what could be under the bed, I try to will 
my leg to move, to retreat back to the safety of the covers, but it 
refuses to respond to my silent commands. A scream locks upon my lips 
turning it into more of a pitiful squeak that would make any nightmarish 
creature laugh at the patheticness of the sound. Abruptly the air 
crackled as thunder rolls over head and there is a resounding boom that 
hits the house with enough force to rattle the very walls of the room. I 
feel the creatures hands retreat ever so slightly and my eye flutter 
open as I awake to discovered that I was sitting within my childhood 
room. I quickly pull my feet back into the bed, wrapping warm safe 
blankets around my body, leaving only my eyes to peer out into the 
darkness of my room. I felt small and afraid and I had not felt that way 
in many years. 

My eyes dart around my surrounds, no monster awaited me at the edge of 
the bed as I figured it would. Even so I waited silently as if prepared 
for its glowing eyes to peer over the corner and crawl out of its hiding 
place, aware that I could never fight it off and ready to feed. Yet no 
eyes appeared and the only sound to greet me was the repeated tapping of 
the rain. Heavy drops that rung against the eavestrough on its 
collective way out to the street down below. Another flash of lightening 
was followed even quicker by an even louder resounding boom. My mind 
leapt about the bedroom as I suddenly realized that something was 
terribly wrong with what I was seeing before me. I shook my head 
frantically in an attempt to puzzle together what it was that was linger 
on the tip of my tongue, not freeing its grasp from my mind. My head 
collided with the plaster wall that ran along the length of the bed 
creating a hollow echo that make me freeze in place. My ears perked in 
alertness for something more furious then any creature that could reside 
under the bed.  

My ears partook the sounds of footfalls under the echoing hammering of 
the rain. Not heavy footfalls, but more of that of a lighter variety. I 
distinctly knew those footfalls from somewhere, but just as my mind 
would not free itself before it still refused to release it grasp as of 
yet. Finally my eyes dropped to my hands for the first time. A child&#39;s 
hands moved before my eyes, young, soft and shaking tremendously. Were 
these really my hands that were before me? Hands so frail and lacking 
such colour that they glowed in the light of the street lamps that shone 
through the window across the room. 

Something clicked, light through window... I could hear the footsteps 
moving closer to the bedroom door, a bedroom that I suddenly realized 
was my own at a time before. A room that I only saw in my nightmares for 
I had not slept within these walls since the age of fourteen. I combed a 
hand through my hair to find it long and matted, another memory from my 
past or was it real? Was my life as a Detective the dream and this the 
reality, I could not tell and the more I thought the more my heart began 
to pound. My eyes darted wildly about the room, taking in everything and 
nothing. Desk, chair, shelves, books, dresser, closet, curtains, 
pendent, bed. Wait... that was it. I returned to the crystal pendent 
that swung gently from the curtain rode. A small moon shaped necklace 
that was given to me by someone special, more I could not recall, but 
that was all I needed for I recalled leaving it in the window at night 
to charge, believing that the moon&#39;s soft blue light would some how 
instil powers into the crystal and protect me from whatever haunted me 
in the night. 

The door knob turned and I quickly rose to my feet, soft mattress moving 
under my feet as I hurried across the bed. I could hear the creaking of 
the door&#39;s hinges and feared I would be too late, that the creature 
beyond the door would get me and I would be no more. I reached the end 
of the bed and set one foot upon the bedframe as I extended my hand 
towards the dangling pendent. My salvation was nearly in reach, I just 
had to grasp it in my hands. 

Fear leapt from my stomach to my throat as a crack of light formed 
across the wall before me. I could not let the light touch me and yet it 
was in my path to the window. Clumsily I leapt from the bed to the 
dresser, knocking many papers and books to the floor, then I moved to 
the desk that sat below the window. My fingers intertwined around the 
crystal and I could feel its warmth run through my hand. Suddenly my 
foot slipped upon some papers on the desk and I toppled to the ground. 
My hands reached out for the curtains only to feel them slip between my 
fingertips as I felt the world rush passed my head on my way towards the 
hard wood floors. 

My shoulder was the first to strike the floor, followed closely by my 
head and then the rest of me. I landed in a heap at the foot of my bed 
and saw bright flashes of light before my eyes for a moment, then 
darkness surrounded me. I do not know how long I was out for, but after 
a time I started to stir once again. The back of my head hurt like a 
bugger and my shoulder felt out of place. 

I cried out as I struggled to a seated potion and held my shoulder. It 
was indeed out of place, but I&#39;d grown used to this over the years. I 
could not recall how my shoulder ended up in such condition, but I 
discovered very soon that I could return it back to shape. Lacing my 
hands together behind my back I pulled on my arms until my elbow touched 
each other and my spine. I heard my shoulder pop and a sharp pain sliced 
through my body causing me to cry out and curl up in a ball on the 
floor. My forehead touched the floor and for the first time I realized I 
was not in my bedroom. The floor was hard and smelt damp, like that of a 
basement. 

Quickly I sat up again and spotted the crystal glowing faintly in the 
dimly light room. With a sigh of relief I scooped up the pendent and 
held it tight between my tiny fingers. No matter how much my rational 
mind tried to tell me how silly it was to believe in a necklace being 
able to protect someone my other side shouted madly at how ignorant my 
rational mind was. I mean my rational mind believed I was an adult and 
yet I clearly couldn&#39;t be over ten years of age so clearly my rational 
mind had no clue about the workings of the world. I laughed to myself as 
I listened to the bickering of my persona, when the lights suddenly 
turned on. 

My rational mind shut up quickly as I suddenly realized where I sat. All 
around me were grey cement walls that had been stained with water damage 
over the years. A small window could be seeing at the top of one of the 
walls, but only darkness could be seen through it. The room was filled 
with many boxes and there was a set of wooden stairs that lead up. At 
the top of the stairs stood a large man dressed in grease stained jeans 
and a dirty shirt sleeved white dress shirt. His face covered in 
shadows, however I did not need to see his face to know he was my father 
and more so I knew what he was doing there. I shook my head as the man 
slowly descended the stairway, each step creaking against his immense 
weight, I recall him telling me his size was due to him being a wrestler 
whilst he was in high school. I have no idea what wrestling had to do 
with his weight, but I remember his gut being strong as steel and 
hitting him hurt my hand. I glanced up to see him stop for a moment to 
close the door and locked it behind him. 

Quickly I scrambled backwards in search of a place to hide. He had not 
yet seen me and for some reason I felt the need to stay hidden. At the 
back of the room I found an old metal framed cot and crawled under it, 
curling up with my back to the wall the necklace clenched tight in my 
hands. 

My father slowly crossed the room, his feet dragging as he went, as if 
he had been heavily drinking, which he frequently did. He approached the 
cot and I could feel fear rise up inside of me, fear of him discovering 
me down then where I should have been in bed. He did not seem to notice 
me, in fact his eyes seemed glazed over and vacant, as if no one was 
home inside of his body. He trudged across the cement flooring to the 
cot and plopped down heavily upon the mattress. The frame sagged against 
his heavy build and I needed to squeeze up against the wall in order to 
avoid being crushed. I could feel myself holding my breath as I lay 
there, praying that he would leave quickly. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; I heard him sob. I had never heard my father sob before. 
What could have made him so upset? &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, Brenda...&quot; His words 
held heavy on my heart as I listened to his sobs, &quot;I never...&quot; The 
springs on the cot squeezed as he moved slightly. I could see one of his 
hands hanging between his legs, which were spread apart, and I 
envisioned him leaning over with his elbows on his knees and his hands 
on his face, an image I&#39;d had seen from time to time and it made me 
wonder how long he had been holding in those tears. Then something else 
came into light. A long cylindrical object that I at first thought was a 
silver pen, but it couldn&#39;t be a pen for it was much thicker then 
normal. Before I had time to figure out what it was he pulled the object 
back up and I felt him lean against the wall above me. 

Twisting ever so slightly I peeked through a crack between the wall and 
the mattress to see my father&#39;s back. I could barely see his face, which 
was dirty from working on cars all day and tears streaked through the 
grease and grim. The pained look upon his face make me want to reach out 
to him. I could felt a need to swallow back my own tears as I watched 
him sit there. Finally I got up the courage to reveal myself when I saw 
his hand move and I suddenly knew what he was holding in his hand. I 
shook my head in disbelief as I watched him bring a pistol to his head. 
I did not have time to utter a single word as the room filled the 
echoing bark of a single shot from the gun and I watched as my father&#39;s 
head was thrown sideways from the blast and collapsed to the bed. 

A scream like none other emitted from my throat and I clenched my eyes 
against the images that invaded my mind. There was no way any of this 
had happened. It was all a horrible nightmare and I wanted nothing more 
then to be freed from is grasp. I clenched my eyes tightly as I tried to 
shake the images that tried to cling to my memories. This was nothing 
but another nightmare. I had to be. It just had to be.
