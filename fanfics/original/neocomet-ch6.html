Izabura Park, District Nine, Nagoya, Neo-Japan

&quot;Julia, will you hurry up?! Anyone would think you didn&#39;t wanna go 
home!&quot;

Three days had passed since Julia McAmish had been rescued from the 
Bio-Technological Research Facility of the greater Nagoya area. They 
would have gone straight to meet up with Julia&#39;s father, Simon, if not 
for the problems of checkpoints. It took a while (by policy) for it to 
be opened. Now that the three day wait was over, Ayame and Julia made 
their move towards it. They had plenty of time to reach the checkpoint. 
It wouldn&#39;t be closing for another two days. But Ayame was in a rush to 
meet up with Simon so she could get her payment and move on. The two 
couldn&#39;t move to the pace that Ayame had set for them however, because 
Julia had become far more loose and free than she had been three days 
ago. She was adjusting to her freedom well. Now that the shock of her 
rescue was over, she allowed herself to enjoy it. And it was because of 
that, that she was taking so long to keep up with Ayame. 

The young women stood by the line of tall oak trees that made up one of 
the four boarders of this park they were in, Izabura Park. It was 
typical of most parks in name, but was far more appealing than most. 
This park held none of the ruination that effected others of its kind. 
It was full of rich flowers of amethyst and cream tones, finely cut 
grass and overpoweringly lengthy trees. Julia crouched down to a small 
bush that was separated from the grass by a small black metal railing. 
The woman carefully placed her long fingers around the stem of one of 
the flowers in that bush. It was a violet. What the Neo-Japanese called 
&#145;Sumire&#39;. And it was truly beautiful. Julia smiled softly and held the 
flower to her nose, taking a deep whiff of the scent. 

It was suddenly apparent to Ayame that Julia was more of an 
outdoorsy-type girl than she had originally given her credit for. 
&quot;Julia? Are you listening to me? We don&#39;t have time for this. You have 
to meet up with your Dad and I want my-&quot;

&quot;-Your money?&quot; Julia filled in, &quot;Ayame... money isn&#39;t the only thing 
that&#39;s important in the world. Everything around the globe is so ruined 
right now. That&#39;s why when you see such beautiful things in the flesh... 
you have to take stock and admire them. That&#39;s what it means to live.&quot;

Ayame shut her eyes, sighing. &quot;You&#39;re too kind for your own good. But 
that&#39;s not what I grew up believing. I taught myself to take what you 
can, when you can. And to hell with anyone or anything else.&quot;

Julia looked over her shoulder, back at Ayame. &quot;...I know you can&#39;t 
really feel like that. Don&#39;t you want to experience the joys life has to 
offer you? I know I do. I want to be happy. And I want the people around 
me to be happy. That way, nobody will have to suffer again. Money can&#39;t 
provide something like that.&quot;

For such woman, with her head stuck in the clouds 90% of the time, Julia 
made sense. What she had been hoping for might have been a little na&iuml;ve, 
but she did make sense. &quot;...After all you&#39;ve been through... why would 
you even care what happens to others?&quot;

&quot;Because...&quot; Julia&#39;s smile fell a little, &quot;...if I didn&#39;t care... the 
people who I shun would end up repeating their mistakes. And then more 
people would have to endure. I know that some folks follow this idea of 
an eye for an eye, but where does it stop? I believe that life will get 
better if we learn forgiveness. You can break the chain that way.&quot;

Ayame gave a small smile. She liked Julia a lot. No matter what the 
world threw at her, she seemed to retain a sort of honest kindness about 
her person that you did not see much of in the world of 2080. It made 
her different. Special. Now Ayame could see why Simon was so desperate 
to rescue his daughter. She was truly a woman like no other. While Ayame 
took a second to just admire this soft, tranquil girl, the sound of 
heavy footsteps gave an added rhythm to the background. The peaceful 
chirping of the birds came to a halt and they flocked away from the 
branches of their trees as the footsteps came to a stop. Ayame herself 
did not notice any of this until she saw a look of disquiet in Julia&#39;s 
emerald green eyes. 

The Dark Katana blinked. &quot;...What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t... know...&quot; Julia looked around. Then stopped and gasped as she 
looked behind Ayame. The Neo-Japanese woman was just as confused by that 
so turned around herself. And her eyes widened with the sight of it. 

Around fifteen metres behind Ayame stood a medium-height figure. But no 
ordinary creature it was. It didn&#39;t even look human. A beast. Of a pale 
tone of ashy grey skin, covered in a set of thick, purple-tinted veins. 
Over its body in certain sections were plates of silvery futuristic 
armour. Over its shins, upper arms, wrists, thighs, chest and face. The 
face itself was covered by a metallic mask. Carrying only two eyeholes 
(which were burning with a flaming colour of green) and four thin 
rectangular slits acting as air holes for the mouth. The metal mask went 
all the way around its head, only one point uncovered. From that small 
point at the back of the cranium came a huge spiky bush of sandy-colour 
hair. And aside from the slight gaps in the armour where that grey skin 
showed through; the sand-tone hair was the only part of this vile man 
that looked organic. 

&quot;...What the heck are you?!&quot; Ayame shouted. 

The creature breathed heavily, just before it spoke. &quot;My... name... 
is... Ras... es-Shamrah. ...Test... Subject...019... Julia... must... 
return... to... research... department... now. Under... orders... of... 
Doctor... Bai...&quot;

Ayame gripped the hilt of her sword, Nobunaga. &quot;Like hell she will! If 
you don&#39;t want me to slice you to bits then you better back off now, 
whatever the hell you are!&quot;

Ras ignored that and began moving straight for the pair of them. Julia 
quickly scrambled up to her feet with a terrified look in her eyes, 
while Ayame ordered her to stay back. The girl did as she was asked, 
stepping back from Ayame, giving her room. It had been a while since her 
sword had seen some action. It was time to awaken Nobunaga. Ayame 
tightened her hold over her blade and yanked it straight out of its 
sheath, assuming a fighting stance with it. Ras stopped marching ahead 
when it saw Ayame draw her sword. Then it reached behind its back. It 
was at that point that the Dark Katana realized that Ras was armed. The 
&#145;Genocide Weapon&#39; pulled out a long metallic rod from behind its back. 
Along the length of the rod was the engraved name &#145;Baga&#39;enka&#39;. And one 
end was blunt while the other was circular. From that end came a burst 
of plasmatic energy, which began taking on the curved shape of a blade 
of a Naginata. Ayame could tell that this wasn&#39;t a product of Ras 
es-Shamrah&#39;s mesh between organic and mechanical. That rod, Baga&#39;enka, 
was magically endowed. Ayame didn&#39;t know just what the hell this thing 
was... but she knew somehow that she would not get an easy time out of 
fighting it. Still, it wasn&#39;t like she had much choice in the matter. 
The Dark Katana gripped Nobunaga in a firm hold bellowed a feminine war 
cry as she charged at the taller, muscular-metallic monster called Ras 
es-Shamrah. The creature didn&#39;t move, it held its own and remained as 
Ayame came at him. It swung Baga&#39;enka around his body and back with 
tremendous skill, spinning around until came into a double-handed 
position in front of him. Ayame&#39;s blade clashed loudly with the Plasma 
Naginata in that second, the two weapons locking with each other in a 
stand off. Ayame looked up into the thin light that was beamed from the 
metal mask of Ras. And she strained to hold her own against it. Her arm 
muscles went to great length to do this, just as she forced her feet as 
firmly into the ground as possible. 

&quot;Damn...!&quot; Ayame spoke, seething, &quot;...This &#145;thing&#39; is stronger than it 
looks...&quot;

The frightened Julia watched this all with terror. The hideous monster 
had Ayame pinned down with a weapon lock. It so clearly was stronger 
than Ayame. But there was absolutely nothing that the Scot could have 
done for her. During her time in captivity, Julia had been given a 
certain chemical injection every few months. One that blocked out her 
magical powers for quite some time. She had absolutely no idea how long 
the last injection would last, but even now, Julia could feel her 
helplessness. She was completely powerless to help Ayame in her current 
state. Ayame herself tightened up inside herself. A bead of sweat 
dropped down the side of her face, over her cheek. Though her arms did 
not buckle under the pressure of the weapon lock, her feet were slowly 
being pushed back by the strength of Ras and his Baga&#39;enka. Overpowering 
the thing was very unlikely now. Ayame&#39;s long ponytail of smooth black 
hair whipped around her as she jumped back, relinquishing the clash of 
weapons. Ras es-Shamrah&#39;s form nudged forwards slightly at the loss of 
weight support, but held up strong, all things considered. Ayame stepped 
back, exchanging glances with Julia briefly, just to make sure that she 
was okay. 

She was fine. Ayame turned back to face with the silent Ras. &quot;Bastard. 
Standing between a woman and her payment. I haven&#39;t got time for this, 
freak. I&#39;ve got a delivery to make.&quot;

And so Ayame crouched a little, sheathing Nobunaga but still keeping her 
hand on the hilt. It was time for that move. It probably wouldn&#39;t hurt 
Ras all that much, thanks to all that armour he was wearing. But it did 
have another use. Ayame smirked a little and locked eyes with Ras across 
from her. There was no time the present to try this out. The woman 
stepped back a little for a build up of movement, then forcefully yelled 
out, 

&quot;Ayame Rushing Slash!&quot;

Then Ayame&#39;s torso thrust straight aside the bio-tech monster of the 
Shougatsu, moving like a blur with the speed of lightning. Neither Julia 
nor Ras itself could have seen her when she was moving at that speed. 
The woman skidded past Ras a second later, while her right hand pressed 
into the ground to keep from sliding any further. Her blade was drawn 
again. And her  smile made a welcome return. Ras breathed heavily, his 
hulking form swerving around to see his adversary. But the attack had 
done nothing to hurt him. The speed was great but what was the point of 
the attack if it couldn&#39;t even damage him?

Ras snorted. &quot;...Pathetic...&quot;

&quot;Is that right?&quot; Ayame stated, standing upright, &quot;Take a look above you, 
freak show.&quot;

Ras es-Shamrah did just that, looking up at the sky. But his urgency 
soon jumped as he did that. Three of the towering, thick and brilliant 
oak trees that they had been standing beside were now coming down over 
him. Sliced at the lower bottoms of their tree trunks by none other than 
Ayame. That was what she had been doing. Not attacking Ras with outright 
force but distracting him so that he was led into this trap. The trees 
were large and slow-moving but Ras was too caught off-guard to do 
anything about it. The three huge oak trees came down with violent force 
and smashed on top of him, pilling up in the worst possible way. Once 
the sound of falling timber had cleared away, all that was left was Ras, 
pinned beneath the long trunks of the oak trees. Ayame quickly sheathed 
Nobunaga and gestured towards Julia.

&quot;...That won&#39;t hold him long! Julia, come on! Run!&quot; She yelled. 

The Scottish girl took one last look at Ras before running around him 
and towards Ayame. Once they were close enough to each other, Ayame 
gripped her hand and the two sped up for the other side of the park. 
They ran straight to the northern most part of Izabura Park and cut 
through the thin wire fence to make it do a small, abandoned road. 
Across the street was a private garage, and Julia began to remember that 
they had been here before. Ayame ran with her across the street and 
stopped right before one of the long chain of private garages on this 
road. Ayame fished out a key from one of the back pockets of her denims, 
and slotted it into the small keyhole on the bottom half of garage door, 
unlocking it. She then yanked the door upwards as fast as she could, 
revealing the innards of it. But one thing in particular stood out. And 
that was Ayame&#39;s pilfered bike, Megumi. The Japanese woman dashed over 
to her motorcycle and mounted it, now taking out the key for the bike 
itself. Ayame slotted the key in the underside ignition and the engine 
of her beautiful baby came to life. 

Ayame gestured over at Julia again. &quot;Would you hurry up and get on?!&quot;

&quot;R-Right!&quot; Julia nodded to her and ran straight for Ayame and her bike. 
She stepped over the passenger half of Megumi&#39;s seat and roped her arms 
around Ayame&#39;s waist, clinging tightly to her. This attack by Ras was 
unexpected so they had to make for the checkpoint now. The Dark Katana 
revved up Megumi, then peeled out of the garage, ignoring the fact that 
she left the door open. Ayame drove out onto the quiet road and made a 
quick turn to the right, towards the second checkpoint, which existed 
deeper into the heart of Nagoya. Then once the bike came out into the 
main road a deafening, rumbling sound rang out in that quiet area. And 
Julia screamed as she saw why. The sluggish but yet somehow quick form 
of Ras es-Shamrah jumped straight over that wire fence of Izabura Park 
and landed noisily into the stone of the surrounding pavement. The rock 
beneath him was actually broken into shallow footprints from the 
combined force of weight and jump strength. Ayame blinked at the sight 
of it. And in the very second of verifying location, Ras began charging 
at them. 

Ayame scowled to herself and drove straight in the opposite direction to 
get away from the thing. As she zoomed down the road, Ras began a speedy 
dash in pursuit. Julia looked over her shoulder as Ras chased after them 
at a distance of about twenty metres. Ayame herself could see this from 
the side mirror of the cycle. She instantly pressed more speed out of 
her stealthy Megumi-chan, increasing the pace of the chase. Even Ras 
couldn&#39;t keep up with that, and slowly began fading into the background 
as Ayame and Julia drove down that length stretch of road. Once Ras was 
out of sight, Julia turned her head and leaned into Ayame&#39;s back. She so 
frightened now. The Research Facility were actually making an effort to 
re-capture her. 

Whilst turning a corner, Ayame could feel Julia softly sobbing against 
her back. She couldn&#39;t be blamed for that. It was likely to be a scary 
experience for anyone. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Julia. I&#39;ll protect you. From 
everything.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Dragon&#39;s Breath Forest, outside Neo-China  

Setsuya&#39;s mighty Tetsuzanko blade nimbly slashed through each vine that 
hung in his way. He chopped and hacked through each vine, branch, tree 
and bush until a new path was made ahead of him; cutting through the 
forest and towards their destination. Just a short few paces behind him 
was Lin-Lin&#39;s Grandfather, Chen Hu. He had recovered from the attack but 
was still a little shaken. And some respects, so was Setsuya. There was 
a violent anger reflected in his eyes. Anger that did not come naturally 
to Setsuya. Despite his bad manners and penchant  for combat; Setsuya 
was a mild-natured person. But all that changed in him as he though of 
Lin-Lin. The events that took place just a few hours ago would not have 
been forgotten. Even though they happened so swiftly. It was simply 
unimaginable for such a thing to happen to a village as peaceful as 
Lin-Lin&#39;s was. 

Setsuya had just come down to see his girlfriend after a fairly long 
time apart. Before he even got to see her, Lin-Lin&#39;s village was up in 
flames. And a mysterious group of military looking troops marched into 
the ruins; doing as they pleased, attacking helpless villagers. And 
going so far as to *kidnap* Lin-Lin. Setsuya scowled at the memory of 
it. After discovering Lin-Lin&#39;s fate from her grandfather, Setsuya left 
to help out those who were injured. And it was sheer horror to do that. 
Most of the other villagers were either too frightened to speak or act. 
Others were so scared that they viewed all outsiders as a threat. Which 
included Setsuya. Even though he had gotten on so well with those people 
beforehand, they were terrified of him now. All thanks to the brutality 
of those evil soldiers. But who could they have been working for? They 
had brilliant technology for the standards of 2081. The only group 
Setsuya could think of who would be that organized would have been the 
Neo World Federation. But that was impossible. The NWF were peacekeepers 
and took stock of the situations around them. Albeit some of their 
leadership tactics were at best defined as controversial; the Neo World 
Foundation were not tyrants. But who else could get their hands on 
technology that modern? 

For the moment, Setsuya put it out of his mind. He had to concentrate on 
the task. He continued slashing down all the vines and cobwebs as he 
made his way through the dank forests of the Dragon&#39;s Breath. It was not 
the first time had come through these parts, but it was getting late and 
it was hard to cut a path through those trees. The darkness of Asia 
after the landing of the Genesis Comet was overwhelming. Eventually, the 
shrubbery around the two began to get thinner and thinner. Until Setsuya 
had finally slashed his way through into an open clearing. Large. The 
grass in this part of the Forest was, for some reason, rather trim, 
cutting in shape around a large stone structure, smack dab in the centre 
of the clearing. That building looked more of a shrine, built of aging 
stone and wood, the open air windows  and wooden foundations rotting 
from wear of the rain. Didn&#39;t look like the kind of structure you&#39;d find 
in China, but they weren&#39;t in a Safe-Zone anymore. The world outside the 
security of the Safe-Zones was a harsh and confusing place. Oddball 
scenes like this were a kind of normality. 

Setsuya stepped out into the clearing, sheathing Tetsuzanko at the thin 
scabbard at his hips. Then turned to Chen Hu, whose foot had been caught 
in a ground-borne vine that he shook at. 

&quot;What did you lead me here for?&quot; Setsuya questioned. His voice was a 
little sharper than usual. Mostly because he was far too concerned with 
Lin-Lin and the attackers than some remote building centred in a forest. 

Chen Hu shook his foot loose, then replied, &quot;...Inside that place is the 
reason why those attackers raided our village. I think you should know 
of it.&quot;

&quot;This about that sword?&quot; The younger man asked, &quot;&#39;Cause I find it hard 
to believe that people that organized would tear up an entire village 
just to capture a weapon they have no need for. Why would men carrying 
guns need a sword?&quot;

Chen Hu shook his head, &quot;You Japanese are too logical. Sometimes things 
aren&#39;t always what they seem to be. And the sword in there might be the 
only thing that can help my poor Lin-Lin.&quot;

Setsuya growled. This wasn&#39;t the first time someone had hounded him 
about his lack of faith. But all he cared about now was rescuing 
Lin-Lin. If her grandfather said something was in there that could help 
him; then the Japanese youth had to take the chance. First thing was to 
get inside that place. Setsuya turned to the withered wooden door that 
blocked off the building from entry. It was full of holes and covered 
with spider webs. It was safe to say that nobody had entered the place 
in a while. There was no doorknob either. So, being impulsive as he was, 
Setsuya hauled off and kicked the door. His boot rammed into the rotting 
wood of the door and it instantly broke from the hinges, falling 
backwards till it slammed in the stone floor innards. A cloud of dust 
passed outwards from the door, and a pack of rats scurried away with 
their tiny little squeaks. This place wasn&#39;t very well maintained. Which 
made a lot of sense, since nobody even seemed to come here. 

Setsuya marched inwards, ignored the dirt and dust, taking a glimpse at 
the inside of the stone shack. It was even more grim looking than it was 
from the outside. Tables and chairs were littered over at the corners of 
the room. All battered, all in disrepair. The walls had grown thick with 
darkening damp and greenish mould, while the floor (and the dusty carpet 
on it) was covered with crusty white patches. Obviously the droppings of 
birds that had flown in through the slit, glassless windows. Setsuya&#39;s 
chocolate brown eyes rolled from the condition of the room to something 
just ahead of him and Chen Hu. It was a podium. Small and well sculpted. 
It was still draped with cobwebs, just like the others parts of the 
room, but this podium still looked somewhat new and clean. And upon that 
podium was a sword. Setsuya cast his eyes upon it for the first time. It 
was a Japanese-like design. Shaped almost like a katana. But the blade 
itself was a tiny bit shorter than your average katana. The hilt had 
very strange patterns around it, shaped like animals and symbols. And 
the butt had been capped off with a gold end. It had gleam and polish; 
and looked far too beautiful to be trapped in a god-forsaken place such 
as this. Setsuya blinked, soaking up the skill of its design. It was 
almost as if he were drawn to it...

&quot;Is this...&quot; Setsuya couldn&#39;t take is eyes off the blade, &quot;...the 
sword...?&quot;

Chen Hu nodded, stepping ahead with stern eyes. &quot;Yes. This is what they 
kidnapped my dear Lin-Lin for. Do you know what it is?&quot;

&quot;A sword.&quot; Setsuya replied, bluntly.

&quot;Not just a sword,&quot; Chen Hu turned his eyes to give the blade a glance, 
&quot;This is a weapon that is relevant to your past, you know. Something I 
probably should have mentioned the first time we met.&quot;

Setsuya finally took his eyes away from the sword. &quot;What are you getting 
at?&quot;

And Chen Hu gave his answer. &quot;You are Setsuya Seisuji. Son of Keijiro 
Seisuji. The man who led the first ever excavation of the Genesis Comet. 
The man who went into its cavernous bowels and discovered four &#145;Sacred 
Swords&#39;.&quot;

Now Setsuya understood. &quot;...Are you saying that this is one of the 
swords that my Dad found inside the Genesis Comet...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is.&quot; Chen Hu said. 

Setsuya was in shock. He had heard stories about them before, but he had 
never seen one. At least not to his knowledge. &quot;So... this is the reason 
my Father was killed... all for those Four Sacred Swords...&quot;

&quot;Do not underestimate their importance,&quot; Chen Hu warned, &quot;I have long 
been aware that those swords will come to decide the fate of the world. 
I fear that Lin-Lin&#39;s capture is just the first step in a chain of 
events that will change the very foundations of this Earth.&quot;

Setsuya looked down at Chen Hu. &quot;...How did you get a hold of this?&quot;

&quot;About five years ago,&quot; The village elder started, &quot;A strange man from 
the west came to our village. The man had been badly beaten though we 
had no idea who had done such a thing. We nursed him back to health, and 
eventually he told me a little about himself. He was a weapons 
collector, and refused to be identified as anything but that. He had 
acquired one of the legendary blades that your Father found inside the 
Comet. The one Keijiro had dubbed as Fire Cutter. The Weapons Collector 
told me of its great powers and that he no longer had the strength to 
carry such a sword. Before he left us, he told me to keep it at our 
village. And under no circumstances was I ever to give it away. I 
granted him this request and so we kept the sword here for safe keeping. 
I truth I had forgotten all about it until a week ago. A group of 
soldiers came to the village and demanded to see a sword that could 
&#145;conjure the power of flame&#39;. I now knew that the sword was indeed 
special. And I knew that on no account should I give the sword to them. 
But I had no idea they would actually attack my village...&quot;

Setsuya nodded and walked up to the sword. He placed his hand on the 
smooth blade, and blinked. It was actually warm. No wonder the blade was 
infused with the power of Fire Magic. There was nothing to be said 
against the idea. 

&quot;Setsuya...&quot; Chen Hu addressed the boy again, &quot;That sword is special. If 
I had known that group was going to kidnap my Lin-Lin... I would have 
probably given it to them. But those people have proven themselves to be 
evil. You must save Lin-Lin. You must wield that sword and use its power 
to get my granddaughter back. I know this is a selfish request, but I 
must ask...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuya waved Chen Hu&#39;s concerns off, &quot;I want to rescue Lin-Lin 
just as much as you do. Those people are not to be trusted. And I can 
tell there is more to this thing then just stealing a sword. They have a 
hidden agenda. I&#39;m going to find out just what it is as soon as I find 
Lin-Lin.&quot;

That was his determination. Setsuya&#39;s gloved hand shot forwards and took 
a firm grip of the Fire Cutter. The sword seemed to take an even 
brighter gleam as he did this. Not an illusion. Setsuya gasped as a 
dragon-shaped flame appeared at the hilt of the sword. It travelled down 
the steel of the blade in a spiral. It grew bigger and bigger until it 
hit the stone of the podium, dissipating with a flash. It left behind a 
trail of smoke and made the sword easier to free from its resting place. 
Setsuya took the blade up from the stone and gazed once more at its 
wonderful beauty. 

Though Setsuya couldn&#39;t really understand it, he felt that his fate was 
tied into the fate of the Fire Cutter now. Just what path had he 
accepted to walk on now that he and the Fire Cutter were one?
