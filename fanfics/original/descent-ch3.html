<a href="../original/descent-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        The sunrise was not long in coming when Nocturne finally 
pushed Descent gently away from her. The vampire&#39;s bone pale body 
was naked as she flopped over on her back, a slight smile on her 
face. Softly she cooed, &quot;You learn your lessons well, Anne.&quot;

        Descent&#39;s long black hair draped over her body, but her 
nipples poked up through the long hair impishly. &quot;And I most enjoyed 
learning them,&quot; she softly admitted. The bedroom fit the look of the 
entire house, old world style with modern components. The big bed 
they lay on was soft and comfortable, the sheets cool and silken 
smooth as their bodies entwined.

        &quot;I won&#39;t take your memory of what happened tonight away,&quot; 
Nocturne reached out to gently stroke Descent&#39;s cheek, &quot;I doubt I 
could if I tried.&quot; She smiled, &quot;Instead, I merely ask that you not 
speak of what you saw here tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Just do no harm,&quot; Descent answered softly, &quot;and you will 
have no reason to fear.&quot;

        The vampire nodded thoughtfully. &quot;In your way you are more 
of a predator than I, aren&#39;t you?&quot; she smiled. She reached over to 
the nightstand, pulling out a fat envelope before passing it 
over, &quot;Here, take this with you when you go.&quot;

        Descent took it before realizing it was full of money. She 
frowned, &quot;I don&#39;t...&quot;

        &quot;I know Lisa was wrong about you,&quot; Nocturne smiled 
slightly, &quot;but I also suspect that it might assist you in what 
you&#39;re going to be doing.&quot; More seriously she continued on, &quot;It 
would please me if you would take it.&quot;

        Descent nodded slightly, weighing the envelope 
thoughtfully. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, then a slight smile teased her 
lips. &quot;I was wondering if I could visit you again,&quot; she asked softly.

        Nocturne smiled back, &quot;I look forward to it. She yawned, 
looking just a bit embarrassed. &quot;Dawn is coming soon,&quot; she said 
apologetically, &quot;could you take Lisa back home? I think that 
Dominique would feel better if you did that.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Descent smiled, leaning down to gently kiss 
Nocturne.

        Descent dressed herself quickly, her black pants and shirt 
pulled on over her otherwise nude body, the envelope slid into her 
trenchcoat pocket. She retraced her steps to the sitting room, where 
Lisa and Dominique lay dozing in a tangle of limbs on one of the 
heavily stuffed chairs.

        Dominique smiled drowsily, &quot;Thank you.&quot; She picked Lisa up 
and carefully dressed her, then Descent felt a surge of power come 
from the vampiress. She passed the girl to Descent, &quot;The child will 
merely remember a normal date, not what really happened.&quot;

        There was a sound of regret in the vampire&#39;s voice, and 
Descent looked over at her curiously. &quot;Why don&#39;t you let her 
remember?&quot; she asked.

        Dominique smiled sadly, reaching out to gently stroke the 
hair from Lisa&#39;s face. &quot;I tried that once,&quot; she said simply, &quot;she 
couldn&#39;t handle it.&quot; She yawned, rubbing at her eyes tiredly, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, I must retire before the dawn.&quot; With that, she stumbled away.

        The other door to the room opened up, and the brunette maid 
stood there. She gave Descent an assessing look, &quot;You still retain 
your memories.&quot; She actually smiled slightly, &quot;Good. I&#39;ll take you 
to the door, ma&#39;am.&quot;

        &quot;Why is it good?&quot; Descent asked as she fell in behind the 
maid.

        &quot;Keeping their vampire natures a secret makes it difficult 
for them to have friends,&quot; she explained simply, &quot;I hope that you 
might become one.&quot;

        Descent nodded thoughtfully. &quot;You care about them a great 
deal,&quot; she ventured as they strode down the hallway.

        &quot;I love them both,&quot; the maid smiled just slightly as they 
reached the doorway to the street, &quot;they took in a strung out drug 
addict and made her into a woman named Natasha. They saved not only 
my life, but my very soul.&quot;

        Descent took that in then she smiled as Natasha opened up 
the door for her, &quot;I look forward to seeing you again, then.&quot;

        Dropping Lisa off at her home was easy, then Descent took to 
the streets and alleys of the city once again. There was a bit of 
bitter cold in the morning air, but the hookers and joyboys still 
stood on their corners for as long as they could. Descent left them 
alone, especially after some of the girls made it clear they did not 
appreciate her interference.

        The men met in the shadows, exchanging heavy bags of white 
powder for a suitcase full of money. Or they would have, if someone 
hadn&#39;t interrupted them. Descent dropped from the rooftops, letting 
her demonic side come to the fore as she struck, tearing open the 
pouches and letting the powder blow away. Guns were raised, but she 
just grinned.

        Her body burned as the bullets punched through her, again 
and again the weapons blasted until she fell, black blood spreading 
out in an oily pool around her. &quot;What the hell was that?&quot; one of the 
dealers managed, cautiously walking over to where the body lay.

        &quot;Bit of overkill?&quot; the money man complained bitterly. &quot;We&#39;d 
better get the hell out of here before the police come.&quot; Without 
anyone noticing the blood began to flow backwards, the parts blown 
apart began to knit themselves back together.

        &quot;What am I supposed to do about the shipment, man?&quot; one 
complained bitterly.

        One of the guards raised his gun warningly, &quot;Cost of doing 
business, friend.&quot; He smiled grimly, &quot;At least we got rid of that 
thing.&quot;

        &quot;Not quite,&quot; the female voice said in a cold whisper. They 
turned around to see the fully healed Descent standing there, her 
eyes glowing bright red even in the morning light. Weapons came up 
again, and in a forceful voice she commanded, &quot;Stop!&quot;

        The men jerked, shocked to discover that indeed they 
couldn&#39;t move. &quot;How did you...&quot;

        &#39;Well, nice to know I can still do that,&#39; Descent mused.

        Descent looked at the group of men, weighing them in her 
eyes. Turning them over to the police wouldn&#39;t help, they were 
merely employees of something much larger. Killing them would be 
personally satisfying, but little else. But making an example of 
them, that might do something...

        The briefcase full of money was pried out of the man&#39;s 
hands, then she opened it up. The lighter the gunman had carried 
made a merry flame, and to the soft sounds of whimpers from the 
frozen men she set the money ablaze. She calmly tucked the lighter 
back in the man&#39;s breast pocket, giving him a dangerous little smile.

        &quot;I can&#39;t stop you from trying to bring drugs into the city,&quot; 
Descent said to them casually as she walked away, &quot;but I will stop 
any shipment I find. Let your employers know.&quot; With that she 
disappeared into the darkness, releasing them from her hold.

        The sound of police sirens blared as Descent watched the men 
scatter, one of the best dressed ones pulling out a cellphone. He 
hit the speed- dial, holding it to his ear, &quot;Ma&#39;am? Something&#39;s gone 
badly wrong with the exchange.&quot; He visibly winced at the 
response, &quot;Miss Diana, it wasn&#39;t our fault. There was a demoness!&quot;

        &#39;Diana,&#39; Descent mused, not choosing to listen any more as 
the man climbed into a sports-car and sped away. It was a name she 
was going to be looking out for, from now on.

        In another part of the city a woman set the phone down, a 
frown on what could have been an almost divinely beautiful face. 
That beauty was badly marred, however, by a symbol seemingly burned 
into her cheek, an ancient symbol for evil.

        Diana reached up to stroke the symbol thoughtfully, then the 
bosomy blonde pulled her hand away. &quot;Contact the Bishop, Grace&quot; she 
calmly instructed her secretary, &quot;let him know that there may be a 
demon in the city.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll channel the contact through the youth organization,&quot; 
the dark haired girl said as Grace noted the request on a personal 
organizer.

        &quot;Have we angered one of the lords of a hell-dimension,&quot; 
Diana mused to herself softly, &quot;or does this have something to do 
with the death of that demon lord a few weeks ago?&quot;

        Grace frowned in thought, &quot;There hasn&#39;t been any indications 
that our patron demon has been displaced.&quot; She called up some 
information on her organizer, &quot;The only unusual thing was that our 
pimps in that part of town claimed they were driven out by a demon.&quot; 
She looked a bit sheepish, &quot;the report wasn&#39;t taken all that 
seriously.&quot;

        &quot;A grave error,&quot; Diana looked down at Grace calmly, &quot;submit 
yourself to the whip for penance. Ten strokes should do it.&quot;

        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Grace choked out nervously.

        As the maid appeared carrying the whip Diana sat back in 
thought, &quot;It seems we have a do-gooder out there.&quot; The first crack, 
and Grace whimpered as Diana shivered in pleasure. &quot;I look forward 
to meeting her,&quot; she mused as she watched the whipping continue.</pre>
