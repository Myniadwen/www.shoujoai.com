<p>“Lost and Found:  emotions”</p>
<p>Riene  Latoli sat watching the campfire carefully, her mind adrift. She was  coming to terms with what had happened on the ship—being one of the  few who had been present during Rachel’s unexpected outburst gave  her a new perspective on the matter—and what was happening now. Being  an educated woman, she presumed something had caused the genie  to go ballistic and release a burst of energy that shot the crew out  of the ship and onto this lonely world. She knew she had not been  the only victim of this incident: Rebecca and Lyara had been forced  here as well, and it took the three of them an hour to come to their  senses, draw up a plausible reason for their presence there, and  conclude that they would need to find their friends, if they had all  made it to the same place, and do their best to survive in the  meantime.</p>
<p>Lyara  had wandered away from the camp an hour ago to stretch her psychic  energy out, hoping to pick up faint traces of emotion; Rebecca was in  charge of finding good and water, while Riene “got lucky” and was  kept in charge of the fire. She stoked it and added twigs and brush  every few minutes, but was mostly wandering in her own thoughts. She  wasn’t nearly as concerned with being rescued or roughing it out in  the wilderness; it was the company she had been thrust into that  bothered her the most. She wanted to think she had finally come to  terms with her feelings for Rebecca, but when her eyes met Lyara’s  before she wandered off, a jolt of excitement stabbed her heart, and  she began reliving all her fantasies. But the worst of it was that  Riene also entertained the possibility that <em>both</em> women would  treat her as their third wheel, and seclude themselves for the sake  of intimacy.</p>
<p>If Riene was  bothered, Rebecca was almost a mess. Riene was nearly ready to  understand how she felt, but Rebecca still felt torn, especially  since she had never received any clear signals. Deep in her heart,  she did want to be with Riene—it had been a love that took hold of  her at first sight, and would not let go no matter how often or how  far her eyes lingered. Riene’s beauty, intelligence, class,  warmth, wisdom, humility, compassion, and understanding were first  and foremost in Rebecca’s thoughts, yet it was difficult  fraternizing with her, simply because she had so many good traits,  and Rebecca feared Riene had no interest in her. It wasn’t just  that: she practically seized up whenever she was around the older  woman, stricken with awe by someone who seemed so disturbingly  perfect for her. The fact that she had never seriously considered  herself attracted to other women before only made her bemusement  worse. Being around Riene <em>did</em> something to her, and it  frightened her, but it also made her strangely happy, like a tiny  piece of her being was being fulfilled at every encounter.</p>
<p>Lyara was another  story. She was a tough, guarded, strong-willed woman of few words,  but she was also sincere, and very pretty, and surprisingly easy to  get along with. Rebecca knew about the Valar’s skill, but eased  into emotional comfort whenever she was around; she felt like it was  okay to be vulnerable, because Lyara was good enough and wise enough  to not take advantage of it. Rebecca wondered if some higher power  was involved in selecting this small party for mutual survival. Did  God mean to bring them together out of amusement for the conflicts  that were to follow, or were they meant to settle all those  difficulties? Would Lyara, Rebecca, and Riene be put through the  wringer, or would they find real happiness? A lot went through her  mind, you see, as she was looking for food, and she wandered back to  camp in an absentminded daze, just in time to notice Lyara plopping  down to rest.</p>
<p>“Any luck?” she  asked. The elf was breathing heavily, and Riene was using one of her  stockings to mop the sweat from her face.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” she  murmured, “I couldn’t sense anybody. We’re either too far  away, or we’re the only ones here. Did you find any water?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I…I’m  sorry,”  she stammered, turning pale from humiliation and guilt. Rebecca  attempted to amend her mistake, and drew out an assortment of  fruits. “I did find some food, though! Um, I mean, I guess it  should hold you until…”</p>
<p>“Forget about it;  I hate listening to excuses anyway.” Lyara took something that  looked like a peach and numbly bit into it. Riene gave Rebecca an  apologetic smile and invited her to sit down. What followed is best  described as an awkward but peaceful silence: Riene and Rebecca sat  next to each other, so close that their shoulders were almost  touching, and Lyara was snacking quietly off to the side. It had  been hard enough for the two women to speak when they were alone, but  now they were with somebody they were both attracted to—someone who  could read their emotions through telepathy, if she desired. It  wasn’t as if they didn’t trust Lyara; it was their own frailty  they had such little faith in. Finally, the elf stopped eating and  decided to get the ball rolling, tired of all this dead air.</p>
<p>“You two are  awfully quiet. I haven’t offended you, have I?”</p>
<p>“No, of course  not, don’t be silly,” they said. “There’s just not very much  to talk about.”</p>
<p>“So you two don’t  want to get to know each other while you still can? What about me? I’m sure you have lots of questions.”</p>
<p>“Sure, but it’s  mostly about your past, and you already said you’re a bit sensitive  about that.” Lyara nodded.</p>
<p>“I’d rather  focus on the present anyway. People who get bogged down in their own  history aren’t even worth my time. Sometimes you just have to  shrug all that off and start anew. I will say my life is a lot  happier now, and I’m beginning to make real friends. So what about  your lives, ladies? It’s only fair I ask the same question.”</p>
<p>“Quid pro quo,”  Riene admitted, “though I’m afraid my life has been very dull up  until I joined. I mostly passed my time studying diplomacy and  language. I had a Merovian for a teacher, so I was very lucky.”</p>
<p>“That <em>is</em> lucky,” Lyara admitted in awe. “Merovians are the final  authority in diplomacy and philology, but I never liked them. They’re even less emotional than Yuns. I don’t think I’ve ever  met a single one that so much as smiled.”</p>
<p>“Then  I suppose  mine was just weird,” Riene answered blithely. “She was such a  bright and happy spirit! She definitely didn’t fit the stereotype. I  actually received a letter from her children not too long ago; she  just recently passed away. I wanted to see her one more time, but I  guess it’s not meant to be. Well, I’d at least like to put  flowers on her grave. So what about you, Rebecca? Want to shed a  bit of light on your previous incarnations?”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid  I’ll only embarrass myself,” she chuckled sadly, still happy that  she was finally speaking with the woman of her dreams. “My life  isn’t nearly as flashy as my aunt’s. My father, you see, he…sort  of ran out on my mother and me when I was still a baby. I haven’t  heard from him since I was…ten, I think. He’s supposedly  conducting private research on another planet. He’s some famous  geneticist. What upsets me the most about it is that my mother’s  apparently fine with the whole deal, and is still living on the  Marlin Colony satellite over New London. I guess she’s just  waiting for the old deadbeat to come back. Anyway, my aunt taught me  how to take care of myself whenever my mother wasn’t available,  and…there’s not much else. Someday I’d like to see my mother  move out of that dump, and I’d also like to see what kind of man my  father is, so I can give him a swift kick in the ribs for all the  trouble he’s caused.”</p>
<p>“Parents <em>can</em> be an inconvenience,” Riene admitted with a sad smile. She was now  making direct eye contact with Rebecca, and could feel a burden roll  off her back, as if in that humble exploration of years gone by, they  had finally crossed the obstacle that kept them from truly  connecting. It was a simple, relieving, gentle moment, and the two  women said nothing else, believing they had finally come to their  limits. They each felt hope stirring anew in their hearts, and if  Lyara had not been there, they might have released the last of their  inhibitions, and kissed. But it was not to be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“At least you two  remember who your parents are,” she sighed, throwing all her cores  and pits into the fire. “Ah well. There goes my piece. Break’s  over!” She stood up, successfully breaking the tender moment with  Elvish clumsiness, and dusted herself off. She extended both her  hands and pulled the women to their feet, ready to get back to work.</p>
<p>“I should  probably go look for some water again,” Rebecca said. She glanced  between Riene and Lyara—two different possibilities laid before  her, each with her own promises and problems—and filed away without  another word.</p>
<p>“That leaves me  to resume my fruitless efforts,” grunted the Valar. She smiled  coolly at Riene, educing a blush. “And what are you going to do,  Miss Latoli? We can’t stay here forever, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” she  answered thickly, “I just don’t know what I <em>can</em> do. I’m  not the outdoorsy type.”</p>
<p>“Well, help one  or the other, then. Take your time deciding.” Lyara waved and  strolled away, giving Riene a rather ticklish choice. Tanith had <em>meant</em> for Riene to follow Rebecca, thus ensuring that they had  more private time (she was no fool; she knew who they were attracted  to even without her abilities), but she laid the choice down to avoid  coming on too strong. Meanwhile, Riene was left alone with her  selection, and her doubts, but finally she closed her eyes and  solemnly began walking down her chosen path.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Rebecca had been  walking for about a kilometer and a half before she noticed a group  of animals lined up together in the distance, their heads bowed  gravely as they attended what appeared to be a very religious  ceremony. The predator and the prey shared a fragile coexistence in  this unlikely sanctuary, united in prayer to their supreme animal  god, and some of the more zealous devotees thrust their heads up in  exaltation, baptizing the congregation with the blessings of their  idol. As Rebecca crept closer, favoring the herbivore’s side of  the chapel, she understood why so many creatures could show such  fealty and love to one god, why so many were bending down in prayer,  and why so many grinned as they found salvation in their works; she  would even join them, once the crowd had dispersed. The bounty of  the river flowed with sweet grace and life, something no atheist  could argue against.</p>
<p>But  further up from  the congregation was a rather impressive pool, broad enough to swim  in and deep enough to bathe in. A small but strong flow poured down  from above, and sparkles flew in the air to become rainbows. She  knelt down to test the pool’s temperature, and found it pleasant to  the touch; it was also smooth and clear, like a mirror, and the  waterfall gave refreshing, sweet water to drink and splash in. Rebecca  sampled the bounty and went back to inform her friends, but  was stopped short as she saw Lyara approaching her, a warm, faintly  seductive smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Uh, did you find  something?”</p>
<p>“No, I just  wanted to make sure you got it right this time.” Her eyes narrowed  playfully as they dug directly into Rebecca’s mind, giving the  water a temporary glance. She removed her shoes and dipped her toes  in, cast Rebecca a smirk of approval, and started to casually  undress. Hill paled and took a respectable step backward. “You  did well, Rebecca. Don’t be so shy. I’m not the tough ice queen  everybody thinks I am. Come join me. Perhaps we could expand on our  earlier conversation.”</p>
<p>“Um, yeah, I  guess we could. I mean, if it’s all right with you.”</p>
<p>“Definitely,”  she nodded, shedding her jacket, shirt, and bra as easily as a tree  sheds its leaves in autumn. Lyara had a beautiful, silky-smooth back  covered with faded scars, hinting at a time when she truly had been  rougher and colder; it seemed to beckon Lady Hill. Rebecca carefully  followed the older woman’s lead, breathing heavily the more she was  exposed, until finally she stood bare in the open, feeling primal and  united with nature, an animal force cut away from humanity’s  influence, full of new </p>
<p>thoughts and  brimming, for the first time, with raw, honest sexual energy. Things  seemed to peak as Lyara cast aside all her garments, exposing but a  preview of her strong, feminine body, and broke the water’s virgin  surface as a shaft of light breaks through the clouds. Rebecca’s  chest heaved nervously as she dipped into the pond, but her entrance  was no less poetic: she felt like a maiden taking purification  rites.</p>
<p>“Allow me,  please,” Lyara said gently as she waded closer. Rebecca stood  petrified—eagerly and anxiously—and watched helplessly as Lyara  crossed the boundary and came within touching distance. Lyara’s  head rolled to the side playfully, her exquisite bluish-white hair  tossing as one of her ears drooped a notch. “Your back, I mean,”  she added with a grin. “I’d like to wash it.”</p>
<p>“Oh. Of course.” Lyara chuckled sweetly and poured water over Rebecca’s skin, then  ran her fingers through that long, enviable mane of starlight, so  radiant and perfect that it must’ve been a gift from angels. Rebecca calmed down a little—Lyara’s hands were rough, but very  gentle and tender—and she settled into contentment. <em>You’ve  always wanted her to do this,</em> her conscience prodded. <em>Admit  it: you’re attracted to her. And what does it really matter if  it’s Lyara or Riene? Do you really think one has an advantage over  the other?</em></p>
<p>Her thoughts broke  suddenly as a soft coo of pleasure floated past her lips. Lyara was  embracing her from behind, hands clenched around her tummy, and was  kissing her naked shoulders. Rebecca’s thoughts went blank and she  subjected herself to this unexpected treatment—unexpected, but so  wonderfully sublime! Her chest ached with a strange fire as she felt  her breasts being gently groped, long firm fingers playing coyly with  her taut nipples, lips searing hot kisses on her shoulders, neck, and  jaw. Rebecca was lost in her very first sexual experience, wondering  if Lyara had planned this from the beginning, wondering how long it  would last, wondering how Riene would take it—or if she would even  find out—and wondering, at last, as she quaked from the loving care  of the Valar, whether or not she would allow this woman to pass  through that final barrier. Existence itself became hazy and  questions were thrown into the darkness. Rebecca indulged, because  she really had wanted this, and right now, when she was so completely  consumed with the fires of lust and passion, it didn’t matter who  was on the other end: she would love them with all of her might.</p>
<p>After giving it  more consideration than it deserved, Riene finally chose to accompany  Rebecca. She didn’t want to give her decision another moment’s  thought: she just put one foot in front of the other, and hoped she  could find the white-haired maiden she yearned for (surely she didn’t  have that much of a head start!). There was no more room for doubt  in her heart—there couldn’t be!! She loved Rebecca; she <em>wanted</em> to love Rebecca; she wanted to talk with her and to be with her, to  hold hands and laugh together, to go on dates and bitch about life’s  unfair surprises—to sleep with her, to wake with her, to experience  joy and sorrow with her, and to finish her hour on the stage  alongside the woman she loved—and so, she was taking that first  step, and in a very literal sense, too.</p>
<p>She  found the  stream, as new to the wilderness as she was (she didn’t just study  diplomacy and languages), and she found the animals, though some were  still observing their rites of sanctity. After taking a few sips in  seclusion, Riene carried on for awhile, following the water in hopes  that she could find civilization, or at least a sign of her friends. No  doubt they would be drawn to the water as well. After marching  three quarters of a kilometer, she noticed something odd perched  underneath a fig tree, and ran to it, her heart leaping and her face  glowing. Rebecca’s angelic white hair showed up marvelously in the  world of dusty gold, faded green, and rich yellowy-brown she was now  accustomed to; the young lady looked up and smiled warmly as she  greeted her visitor.</p>
<p>“Did you follow  me?” she laughed. Riene smiled sweetly—she had never been  welcomed so warmly before in her life—and knelt down to recline  alongside her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Well, yes,  actually, I did. Lyara said I could follow one of you and lend you a  hand, and…uh, I chose to go with you. I hope you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“No,  I’m happy  to have you.” Rebecca’s smile grew stronger, and she drew Riene  close, gently gripping her hands. Riene had never felt anything so  thrilling before, not even when she had almost had sex with Chandra:  this left everything in the dust and opened up newer, bolder,  brighter worlds. How could somebody ever transcend sex by touching  hands? This revelation helped confirm, at long last, that Riene had  strong feelings towards Rebecca—she was irrevocably in love with  her—and nothing would stop her from crossing that final boundary. She  leaned in for the kiss that Lyara had interrupted earlier, but  felt the sting of a flat palm whacking her cheek for her efforts, a  literal slap to the face.</p>
<p>“What the hell do  you think you’re doing?” Rebecca said, her voice alarmingly  frosty. “I don’t think of you like that, Riene. As a matter of  fact, the very idea that I could be interested in another woman is  disgusting. It’s vulgar, grotesque, immoral, indecent…oh, am I  hurting your feelings? And what about me? Don’t you think that <em>I’m</em> offended by your assumption? Do you always charge in  like this whenever someone acts friendly towards you? Is that it,  Riene? You know, I thought you were my friend, but it seems you’d  rather be a whore. I hate you.”</p>
<p>Death itself could  not match the hurtful sting of rejection and revulsion. Riene had  feared one, but could never anticipate another. Had she really  looked at things from such a warped perspective? Did she  misinterpret Rebecca’s friendship so much? She never imagined her  mistake could be so disastrous, and she opened her mouth to  apologize, but was not given the chance: Rebecca had walked away,  seething with anger and loathing. Tears came so quickly and easily  that Riene collapsed, robbed of all her strength, condemned to wander  in doubt and confusion, scarred by guilt, sorrowful beyond repair.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,  Lyara, but I can’t be with you like this. I can’t lie to you. I  can’t lie to <em>myself.</em> This isn’t what I want.”</p>
<p>“But it’s too  late to say that now. Look, see? The evidence is everywhere. The  blood of your deception will never wash out, Rebecca. You could live  your whole life trapped in that pond, like a helpless little fish,  and you would never be clean. Now let me get this straight: you  would rather be with somebody else—I can only imagine <em>who</em>—and  yet you fucked me, and you let me fuck you. Just who do you think  you are? How low are you going to sink? How many more lies are you  going to tell yourself? It would be best if you didn’t change your  mind, my dear. If you continue being my lover, everything will just  fall into place, and you’d be able to keep your honor and your  purity…or whatever is left of it.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. It would be easy. But I…I want to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>“She’ll only  forsake you, you know. Just look at what you’ve become! What if  she were to find out? Oh, Rebecca, I could love you just as  powerfully and unconditionally as she could, and you wouldn’t have  to change a thing. I <em>am</em> in love with you. I can be just as  kind and caring as anyone. Please…I don’t want to see you hurt  yourself.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,  Lyara. I won’t say anything else. I hope you can forgive me  for…being so cruel. I hope we can manage to get along after this. I…don’t care what you tell her, because I’m going to talk to  her first. I’m going to be honest. I owe that to her at least.”</p>
<p>“You’ll only be  hurt, Rebecca.”</p>
<p>“It will hurt no  matter what I do. Goodbye.”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Lyara stood  trembling in the wind, her composure in shambles, her faith shaken,  her stomach raw with dread. She closed her eyes and shut herself off  from the world, relaxing her arms, letting her shoulders drop,  sighing until it seemed all the life had left her. She sensed a  wounded soul approaching her, but remained steadfast, wanting no part  in this unnecessary tragedy. In spite of her distance, frail arms  found their way around her, and a mournful, heavy head laid itself on  her shoulders, reddish-orange hair flapping in the wind. Lyara drew  in another breath, shuddered, and reached out to comfort Riene,  abandoning all the hope she had placed in her union with Rebecca.</p>
<p>“You  don’t have  to say anything,” she whispered, before she was cut off. The  sobbing woman had put her lips over Lyara’s mouth, silencing her  sweetly, folding herself into Lyara’s embrace as all her horrors  slowly melted and were released into the air. Time was forgotten.  Propriety was forsaken. Need drove them both to act in ways they  would never have conceived several days ago. Lyara’s barriers were  stripped away; she was being exposed for the woman she was; Riene was  abandoning her inhibitions, feeding herself on the Valar’s  inexperienced, unrelenting attention. Lyara’s mind went blank as  cool air kissed her naked body; she felt a hot, moist tongue burrow  inside of her. Lips which once seemed distant and modest suckled her  bosom, forcing her to breathe heavily, to groan in an unfamiliar  tongue, to black out and pass away into beautiful oblivion. She came  quite hard atop the nude woman, shocked and humiliated, yet aroused  and starving for more.</p>
<p>Riene purred in  approval, laying her finger on Lyara’s bare skin, tracing slow,  ticklish lines on her body, alarming her nerves and preparing her for  pleasures to come. Lyara stared deep into her eyes and forced  herself to come back to the real world. Riene and Rebecca had seemed  so right for each other, and while it was true she had desired them  both, she wanted to deny herself those pleasures, and give them to  worthier lovers; she would be cast into loneliness, content with the  knowledge that she had guided two star-crossed lovers back into the  Garden of Paradise. She would first have to come to terms with her  actions, though, and wound herself for the sake of a greater love.</p>
<p>This  change in her  sobriety brought about a completely unexpected reaction, however. She  had wanted to push Riene away and atone for her harlotry, but  instead, she kicked the naked woman in the chest and plunged her  elbow into her bare back, flattening her to the ground. Lyara’s  face exploded with righteous fury and indignation, and she hastily  dressed herself as her foe stumbled back to her feet.</p>
<p>“What in blazes  did you do that f—“</p>
<p>“In the name of  Eru Iluvatar and the Eldar who serve Him, reveal your true form,  blasphemer!” she cried in Valari. An irresistible force  overwhelmed Riene, stronger than a hurricane and more potent than all  the passions, and she screamed in defeat as her skin cracked and  broke, like the shell of an egg. What emerged from this casing was a  creature distinctly different than Riene, a being that, through the  arts of deception, could impersonate any intelligent creature. Her  cry had been so loud, it attracted Rebecca, who was still dripping  wet and only half-dressed, and the real Riene, who was aghast with  trauma (being dispatched by an apparent Rebecca impersonator was bad  enough, but encountering her a few minutes later, in the state she  was in, pushed her over the edge). She was in no condition to  discover that a doppelganger had been in their company, least of all  one who had seduced and destroyed them in succession, and was  completely unstable. Her only saving grace was the presence of </p>
<p>all-powerful hatred,  a feeling they all shared—but the one thing even more prominent was  the stab of betrayal.</p>
<p>The doppelganger’s  name was Changera, and once upon a time, she had been a member of the  crew.</p>
<p>“Don’t tell  me…” Rebecca gasped. Lyara managed to catch her breath (the  magic she cast took its toll), and confirmed her suspicions.</p>
<p>“It seems this  woman has been hard at work trying to obliterate us through the worst  means possible, though I don’t know why. So, old friend, what’s  your angle?” Changera glared—she was plastered with pieces of  her old skin, hideous and deformed—and snarled, lashing at them  wildly. She broke through their trap and flew away, sprinting across  the veldt on all fours like a feral monster from primordial  mythology, and was soon beyond the horizon. The three women left  staggering in her wake collapsed, feeling disgusted and defiled, and  drew together to embrace and weep, no longer sure of anything except  the malleability of truth and fiction.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Lyara: So let me  get this straight: even though Becky and I <em>both</em> got laid, it  wasn’t with the people we thought we were having sex with.</p>
<p>Riene: Goodness,  no! And all the while you two have been fooling around with that  shape-shifter, I’ve been going through the eighth circle of Hell! I…I feel so violated…</p>
<p>Rebecca: Ssh, it’s  okay, you know we’d never do that to you, honey…</p>
<p>Riene: You mean  SCREW WITH MY MIND, or screw with…me?</p>
<p>Rebecca: Um……</p>
<p>Lyara: Uh…HEY  LOOK, IT’S A DEMONIC DUCK OF SOME SORT!</p>
<p>Riene: Where?!</p>
<p>Rebecca and Lyara: Yoing! they run far away</p>
<p>Riene:  …Ugh, I  can’t believe I fell for that. Hopefully, nobody gets screwed in  the next chapter, “The Solo Journey: overcoming obstacles alone?” Hey,  you two could’ve at least stuck around until the end of the  previews!</p>
<p>Rebecca: (absent)</p>
<p>Lyara: (also absent)</p>
<p>Riene: …HEY, ARE  YOU TWO MAKING OUT BEHIND MY BACK?! Why didn’t I get invited?</p>
<p>Rebecca: actually  playing Candy Land with Lyara</p>
<p>Lyara: losing</p>
