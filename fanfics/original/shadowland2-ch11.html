fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Jessica hauled a box out of a storage closet in the cafeteria and handed 
it to Kris, &quot;Here you go!&quot; She dropped the box into Kris&#39;s awaiting 
arms. 

Kris curiously read the scribbles upon the lid, &quot;Halloween?&quot; She gave 
Jessica a befuddled look, &quot;Is it really Halloween already?&quot; She inquired 
suddenly realizing how quickly time was passing them by. 

Jessica rummaged through the closet more, &quot;That it would be.&quot; She pulled 
out a dummy in a witch&#39;s costume, &quot;Hollow&#39;s eve is the biggest 
celebration in the Western Dorms and we want everything perfect for the 
slumber party.&quot; She handed the dummy to Kai who excitedly took the thing 
and was swallowed by its dress and hair. 

&quot;A Halloween slumber party!&quot; Kai exclaimed from under the folds of 
cloth, &quot;That sounds cool. I wish dad would let us do that.&quot;

Jessica hunted for Kai&#39;s face, &quot;Do you celebrate any holidays in the 
Hall of Candles?&quot; She asked curiously. 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Kris frowned, &quot;Father considered it as us taking sides.&quot; 
She remarked with a shrug. 

Jessica puzzled over this, finding Kai&#39;s face she smiled, &quot;Hey, Kai? How 
long are you planning to stay with us?&quot; She inquired poking the girl 
playfully on the nose. 

Kai wiggled her nose then glanced between Jessica and Kris, &quot;I don&#39;t 
know. Dad doesn&#39;t really know I&#39;m finished my duties yet.&quot; She remarked 
hesitantly. 

Kris smiled down at her sister, &quot;I&#39;m betting Aunt Sophia can arrange 
some time off for you.&quot; She offered.

&quot;You think?&quot; Kai bounced in place causing the head of the dummy to fall 
onto her head and hair swallowed her up again, &quot;I can&#39;t see!!!&quot; 

Jessica laughed, &quot;Let me help you there.&quot; She managed to free the girl&#39;s 
head again, &quot;Take that to the main lobby would you?&quot; She asked. 

&quot;&#39;Kay!&quot; Kai spun around and carefully made her way back through the maze 
of tables. 

&quot;She is a cute kid.&quot; Jessica commented with a grin. 

&quot;She is no kid.&quot; Kris remarked, shifting the box in her arms, &quot;She is 
older then you.&quot; 

Jessica spun around to face Kris, &quot;What do you mean? She can&#39;t be over 
thirteen or fourteen!&quot; She exclaimed. 

&quot;The Sisters do not age the same as everyone when they are in the 
Halls.&quot; Kris explained, &quot;I&#39;m not sure how it works but it is as if time 
doesn&#39;t exist within the realm of death.&quot; 

Jessica blinked in disbelief, &quot;Then just how old are you, anyway?&quot; 
Jessica demanded eyeing the girl. 

Kris blushed and searched for an escape, &quot;Well... uhhh... I...&quot; She 
suddenly wished she had kept her mouth shut, &quot;I spent most of my life 
here.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Only the past ten years or so according to your records. They also say 
you are eighteen.&quot; Jessica stated, examining the girl closely, &quot;Is that 
your real age or what?&quot; She demanded.

&quot;Physically it is.&quot; Kris nervously juggled the box in her arms from one 
hand to the other. 

&quot;What year were you born in?&quot; Jessica continued to probe, &quot;I am the head 
of the dorm. I should know these things.&quot; 

&quot;It was in the nineteenth century Kris answered shyly. 

&quot;So was everyone. That doesn&#39;t tell me anything.&quot; Jessica did not let 
her eyes move from Kris&#39;s, &quot;When!?!&quot; She demanded. 

&quot;Umm...&quot; Kris considered correcting her friend when the lights began to 
flicker and the building to began to shake, &quot;What is going on?&quot; Kris 
glanced around in confusion. A box on the top shelf of the closet tipped 
from its spot and started to fall, &quot;Jessica look out!!!&quot; Kris dropped 
what she held and leapt forwards to catch the others, however was a 
little too late to stop them from crashing down upon Jessica. When the 
lights returned to normal Jessica was partially buried under a pile of 
Christmas decorations with Kris standing over here, a look of alarm upon 
her face.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Jessica moaned as Kris tried to help her out of the 
heap of clutter. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Kris glanced up at the lights, &quot;An earthquake?&quot; She 
suggested.

&quot;At Whispering Hills?&quot; Jessica remarked rubbing her head, &quot;I&#39;ve never 
heard of something like that happening before.&quot; She stated as Kris 
pushed the box off of her, &quot;Owww!!!&quot; Jessica grabbed her back in pain. 

&quot;Are you hurt?!?&quot; Kris knelt to help the girl to her feet. 

Kai came bolting into the cafeteria, &quot;Kris!!!&quot; She shouted frantically, 
&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;Jessica was just mobbed by Christmas decorations, but we&#39;ll be 
alright.&quot; Kris remarked, &quot;What just happened?&quot;

&quot;Didn&#39;t you feel it?&quot; Kai glanced worriedly at the ceiling, &quot;It was as 
if the boundary between realms cracked.&quot;

&quot;Which realms?&quot; Kris asked even more concerned, &quot;How bad of a crack?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kai searched the ceiling and sniffed at the air, &quot;It is 
about two floors up. It is only a fracture now. I&#39;ll go take a look.&quot; 
She started towards the stairs. 

&quot;Kai!!&quot; Kris called out to her sister causing the girl to stop for a 
moment, &quot;You be careful.&quot; 

&quot;I am Keelia after all.&quot; Kai&#39;s right eye began to bleed black tears and 
the image of tattoos began to form around her eye creating a dark flame 
design that snaked down her neck and arm to her fingers. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about it. I&#39;ll handle everything.&quot; She assured with a grinned and dashed 
up the stairs two at a time. 

&quot;Will she be alright?&quot; Jessica asked, using Kris for support. 

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Kris bid a silent prayer before helping Jessica to the 
lobby.
