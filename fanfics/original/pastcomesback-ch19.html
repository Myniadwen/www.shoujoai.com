<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 19 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>      Tsuru still couldn&#39;t believe she actually did that. Now that she was out of the moment 
and had the chance to see her idiocy - how could she have been so foolish?! Poor, poor 
innocent Krystal needed someone better than Isaka and Tsuru was so much better and who gives 
a damn if the demon actually loves her or not - Tsuru could fill in that gap and then some.

      She was sitting on the couch by herself (most everyone else was delivering the &#39;sex 
talk&#39; to Eveon and Mina... somehow Seth got roped in as well) and she grabbed a cushion. 
Tsuru proceeded to scream her frustration in it before removing the eye patch. She looked 
down at it as she started to cry. She could have had everything she wanted... everything 
with just a few words of warning.

      It could have gone like this:

      &quot;Krystal... Isaka... there will come a time where she&#39;ll be tempted by someone else. 
It may be better to just get out of it while you can.&quot;

      &quot;But... no, no, I want to spend as much time with her because I love her-&quot;

      &quot;Isaka can&#39;t understand love - she bases everything off physical need! Krystal, to 
her... to her you&#39;re an interesting, likable girl but what she likes the most is your body.&quot;

      Then Krystal would start to cry and Tsuru would comfort her. The blonde would 
eventually succumb to the fact that Isaka didn&#39;t reciprocate her feelings the way she wanted 
and their relationship would end.

      All Tsuru would have to do is be her comfort and always be there and then... maybe in 
a few months, a year, a decade, Tsuru would be there to have her love.

      But no - she had to play hero. Oh yes Krystal, she loves you! Of course I will support 
your relationship even if I want Isaka dead and you in my arms!

      What kind of fool was she?!

      &quot;You&#39;re a very kind one.&quot;

      Tsuru immediately wiped her tears before turning around. Faye was leaning against the 
doorway to the living room, a solemn look on her face. &quot;It takes a lot of love and 
righteousness to do something like that.&quot;

      The red head adjusted her baseball cap and sat down next to her. &quot;I&#39;m Faye, Goddess of 
Love. We&#39;ve never properly met because I was too busy finding my lover&#39;s surprise when you 
came in.&quot;

      Tsuru gave her a small smile before looking down into her lap. &quot;Goddess of love, huh? 
Do you have any advice for an idiot like me?&quot;

      Faye gave her a small smile. &quot;Not really, but I can tell that you love Krystal very 
much and once upon time you loved Tycara and even Isaka in almost the same way. Not as 
strongly, but almost. So what you did back there by reassuring Krystal was something that 
not even higher level beings would be able to do.&quot;

      As if Tsuru didn&#39;t feel crappy enough. &quot;Isaka, she just... she just doesn&#39;t deserve 
her...&quot;

      Faye shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s probably true, but Isaka loves Krystal very much - so much so 
that she gets scared and tries to act really tough. Instead, she&#39;s very self conscious and 
very protective.&quot; The red head let out a laugh. &quot;I was a lot like Isaka when I was younger. 
I used to sleep with men and women left and right just because I could. Then, well...&quot;

      She gave Tsuru a grin. &quot;A pretty little snake crossed my path. The Isaka you knew 
didn&#39;t understand love at all. For her, it was fun to chase after girls and screw them... 
then Krystal forced her to change when she refused to be any other girl.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s exactly my point!&quot; Tsuru interjected. &quot;Krystal is not like any other girl, 
she&#39;s way stronger than I was and she deserves a lover so much better than Isaka!&quot;

      Faye shrugged. &quot;But they&#39;re in love.&quot;

      Tsuru sighed. &quot;So I&#39;m guessing if I had swayed Krystal away, you would have 
intervened?&quot;

      &quot;Actually, I&#39;m not sure if I would. They&#39;re dear friends to me, but if Krystal would 
feel better with you and not with Isaka, then there&#39;s really nothing I can do.&quot; Faye let out 
a yawn. &quot;Isaka is lucky she has someone like Krystal. I paid for my lecherous ways, kind of, 
when my lover was slaughtered. Isaka has to pay for hers, eventually.&quot;

      &quot;Is that... is that some code of the gods?&quot; Tsuru asked, hoping that Isaka would get 
what&#39;s coming.

      &quot;Nah - it&#39;s just karma,&quot; Faye said, winking at her. &quot;But Tsuru if you&#39;re really 
feeling down...&quot; The red head leaned closer to whisper to her. &quot;Erin seems like she&#39;s an old 
fashioned prude, but she&#39;s actually an open minded girl. We wouldn&#39;t mind having... we 
wouldn&#39;t mind keeping you company tonight if you need it.&quot;

      It took a little longer than a minute for Tsuru to process what Faye just suggested to 
her. She couldn&#39;t help but blush. Her and... and two pretty girls? Faye could see her 
dilemma and gave her a reassuring pat on the back. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry so much. It would be 
more of like a healing, relaxing experience.&quot;

      Tsuru couldn&#39;t believe it - she&#39;d just gotten propositioned by a goddess. Awkward... 

***** 

      &quot;So, when two girls love each other very, very much...&quot;

      Eveon thought she was going to die - literally overheat and die of embarrassment. She 
was trying so hard to ignore Erin&#39;s simplistic explanation of lesbian sex. She quickly shot 
a glance at Seth, mouthing &#39;help me&#39; to the reliable young man.

      Unfortunately, he was just as embarrassed and only gave her an apologetic look. So 
much for help... Earlier, Mina had fallen asleep and that&#39;s when Eveon was dragged away into 
a room with everyone else - Tsuru and Faye had entered a bit later.

      &quot;They consummate their love through the ultimate act of sex,&quot; Faye finished for her 
partner. &quot;Now, the most important things for you to know are the positions and how to use 
your-&quot;

      &quot;Why did I think this was a good idea?&quot; Abby said, covering her face with her hands.

      &quot;Ah... but, it&#39;s really... informative,&quot; Sakura said, paying close attention to the 
love goddess.

      &quot;Why did you drag me into this? Can&#39;t I just go see if Tycara is having a nice nap?&quot; 
Seth asked.

      &quot;Nope,&quot; Isaka said. &quot;You&#39;re part of the team Seth, so you have to be here-&quot;

      &quot;Why are you doing this to me?! And how come Mina doesn&#39;t get the most embarrassing 
talk in the freaking world?&quot; Eveon asked, highly distraught.

      &quot;Well,&quot; Krystal started. &quot;Isaka and I actually... kind of talked to Mina already.&quot;

      The look on the teenager&#39;s face was priceless. Faye, taking her amazed silence as a 
sign to continue, said, &quot;So, now you need to learn all about how to stimulate Mina when 
you&#39;re-&quot;

      &quot;W-w-w-wait! You guys are seriously doing this?! She&#39;s... is she even 16? Aren&#39;t you 
just freaking her out more than necessary?&quot; Tsuru objected, earning a &#39;thank you&#39; from 
Eveon.

      Every other woman in the room looked at her. A minute passed before they all shook 
their heads and went back to harassing Eveon with their sex knowledge.

      &quot;You and I are escaping - now!&quot; Seth said, grabbing Tsuru&#39;s sleeve.

      The blue haired girl nodded. &quot;Alright, saving Eveon from this is a lost cause - we&#39;ll 
have to leave her behind.&quot; 

***** 

      After some time, Mina awoke to find Eveon, lying next to her, staring up at the 
ceiling. The blonde wasn&#39;t looking too good. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

      &quot;I just... I just... did you really get a sex talk from Krystal and Isaka?!&quot;

      Mina flushed bright red. &quot;Well, uh, I-I wanted to be ready in case the moment ever 
came up and... and how did you find out?&quot;

      &quot;This whole party... was just so everyone could sit me down and teach me about lesbian 
sex,&quot; Eveon half shouted, blushing. Mina was shocked and stared at her girlfriend.

      &quot;So, uh... what did they teach you?&quot;

      &quot;Mina!&quot; 

***** 

      Tsuru was in the kitchen, along with Isaka and Krystal when the blonde woman said, &quot;Oh 
no! I knew I forgot something...&quot;

      &quot;Huh? What&#39;s up,&quot; Isaka asked. Tsuru just watched the two, currently seated on a 
stool.

      &quot;I left my sword at the shrine where I&#39;m training. I think I should go get it back 
since you never know when we&#39;ll be attacked...&quot; Krystal let out a long sigh and checked her 
phone. It was late at night, but... She spared the other two women glances. &quot;I&#39;m going to go 
pick it up right now and come back.&quot;

      Before Isaka could protest, she was out of the kitchen... leaving her alone with 
Tsuru. They exchanged a look and it was awkward. The demon got a glass of water and sat down 
at the counter, across from Tsuru. She took a drink.

      &quot;So... did you like everyone?&quot; Tsuru nodded.

      &quot;Yeah, they&#39;re all really nice,&quot; In the back of her mind, Faye&#39;s offer was still 
floating in the air. She was still worrying about it since she saw Erin giving her a wink 
earlier too.

      &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Isaka said, taking another sip of water. The demon looked over at the 
sad girl in front of her. Okay, so maybe she was kind of at fault for a few things... but it 
wasn&#39;t like she- She didn&#39;t purposefully do everything...

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she blurted out. Tsuru just gave her a confused look. &quot;For everything - 
I&#39;m sorry for every thing and Krystal told me how she talked to you and I know you like her 
too and-&quot;

      &quot;Please don&acirc;&#128;&#153;t,&quot; Tsuru said. &quot;Please don&#39;t apologize to me. It&#39;s kind of nice to hear 
it, but... people only say they&#39;re sorry to patch up things or when they see someone get 
hurt. They&#39;re never truly sorry.&quot;

      Well so much for that. Isaka slumped forward on the counter with a sigh. &quot;I never 
meant to screw you over-&quot;

      &quot;But you did and continue to do so,&quot; Tsuru let out a sigh. &quot;You do the worst things 
with the best intentions, you know that? You never think before you act.&quot;

      Isaka let her head rest on the table. &quot;I&#39;m sorry Tsuru, even if you don&#39;t believe me. 
I&#39;m sure that one day, it will all turn around.&quot;

      The blue haired girl scoffed at her suggestion. &quot;Oh please - Isaka, I could be trying 
to open a can of soup and you would ruin it. That&#39;s just how bad you are.&quot;

      The demon let out a slight growl. Tsuru would probably always be mad at her, but that 
didn&#39;t mean she couldn&#39;t make it better, right?
