<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Penny paced about her room, going to the window to look out over the 
school grounds and back to her bed, then to the washroom to check her 
hair in the mirror again, which she had pulled into a pair of low 
ponytails at the back of her neck, and then moved to the bedroom door 
where she would stop for a moment and return to the window again. She 
had got dressed right after Kimberly left, pulling a white summer dress 
over her head and found a pair of white socks to clad her feet in. The 
single dresser in the room turned out to not be very full so she shifted 
her clothes to one draw to give room for Kim&#39;s things and fixed the 
blankets, before beginning her pacing. She was not sure how long she had 
been at it, but she figured it must have been for a while for the clouds 
outside had really darkened in the past while and the room had grown 
quite dark and the gloom was beginning to frighten her, reminding her of 
the basement of the foster home too much so she quickly flicked on the 
overhead light, flooding the room in warm white light. 

She was starting to feel lonely and the approaching thunderclouds were 
beginning to scare the girl so she decided to go in search of Kimberly, 
wherever she may be. She approached the door and opened it to look down 
the long hall before her. Even with the lights along the walls it 
appeared very dark in the hall and this frightened her all the more. A 
low rumbling of thunder convinced the girl to leave her room and she 
quickly moved down the hall, unsure of where she was going, but knowing 
that she needed to find Kim quickly. 

Spotting several girls down the hall Penny stopped in her tracks and 
cowered in the shadows of a nearby corner, watching the girls as they 
turned into one of the many doors down the hall. She glanced up at one 
of the door see the number 1026 on the door and she wondered just how 
many girls lived in this building. Since she awoken here she had met 
several, but she was surprised by just how many doors there were along 
the hallway. She suspected that there were a few, but the room number 
suggested hundreds. She stepped out of the shadows to find the hall 
opened up before her to a grand room with many soft looking chairs and 
sofas around a grand piano. Several girls sat in this area were reading 
by standing lamps next to the sofas and one girl was practising on the 
piano, the sound was somehow soothing and she felt herself having to 
force herself to turn away to continue her search for Kim.

Tanya picked up another tray and added it to the pile next to her before 
picking up the pile and carrying them to the kitchen. She stretched as 
her back ached and glanced around at the girls as they straightened up 
the cafeteria. Emily and Misty were busily stuffing paper plates and 
plastic utensils into a green garbage bag, while Natalie swept much of 
the garbage off the floor into a pile while Cherilyn cleared off a table 
of its clutter into a garbage pail. Kris stood at the far end of the 
cafeteria, silently sweeping and pretty much keeping to herself. Tanya 
recalled her reasons for being angry with the girl and shoved her 
emotions off to the side. She had been a friend of Kris&#39;s for years now 
and the girl has sacrificed her life to save Jenn and herself. Wiping 
her hands on a brown paper towel she tore off from a large roll she 
approached the girl. She needed to hear from Kris&#39;s lips what exactly 
happened between her and Jessica and now seemed like a better time then 
any to have a talk with the girl. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; She waved at Kris as she walked up to the girl, her hands behind 
her back. 

Kris gave the girl a crocked half-smile and continued sweeping, &quot;Hey...&quot; 
She said is a low, miserably voice. 

Tanya glanced around at the tables while rocking on her heels, 
&quot;Listen...&quot; She paused to see if anyone was paying attention to them, 
&quot;Can we talk...?&quot; 

Kris stopped sweeping and glanced at the girl, &quot;If you are here to yell 
at me more then please don&#39;t bother. I&#39;m rather tired right now and 
would rather just get this place cleaned and get back to my room.&quot; 

Tanya glared at the girl and was about to argue when she took a deep 
breath and let it out, &quot;I&#39;m sorry people have been treating you badly.&quot; 

 &quot;Badly?&quot; Kris growled, &quot;I&#39;ve been convicted before anyone even heard my 
side of the story. I&#39;ve tried to be reasonable, but I&#39;m at my wits end 
here and no one is given me a break.&quot;

&quot;Okay,&quot; She waved her hands in front of herself defensively, &quot;Don&#39;t yell 
at me. I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot; 

Kris glared at the girl causing Tanya to take a step back. 

Tanya rubbed the back of her neck in embarrassment, &quot;Alright, maybe I 
haven&#39;t been the best friend I can be, but you have to consider the 
situation here. I saw you on the couch with Jessica.&quot; She reminded the 
girl.

Kris let out a weak sigh, &quot;It is not like that... not really...&quot; She ran 
a hand through her curls and across her face, &quot;It is so complicated.&quot; 
She said in a tired moan.

&quot;Well try me.&quot; Tanya offered, pulling up a chair and sitting upon it, 
her legs and arms crossed, &quot;I&#39;m willing to listen.&quot; 

Kris watched the girl sceptically; &quot;You are not going to judge me before 
I finished my story?&quot;

Tanya shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t want to judge you. We&#39;re friends and I 
want us all to be friends again, that includes you and Jenn.&quot; 

Kris dropped into a chair near her and placed her head in her hands, 
&quot;Lord, Jenn hates me now does she not?&quot; 

Tanya shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t think so, she is just angry and 
confused.&quot; Tanya explained softly, &quot;Think of what she is going through. 
She spent over a year in a dream world where she thought everything was 
just fine when she is suddenly pulled out of that world to face this.&quot; 
She spreading her arms wide and gesturing to the room, &quot;You have to 
admit this place is not exactly perfect. Girls walking around with 
swords and knives, strange magical teachers, demons hiding in the trees, 
and to top it all off her entire life turns out to be a lie.&quot; 

&quot;I know. I know.&quot; Kris breathed helplessly, &quot;I&#39;ve been telling myself 
that over and over again. I&#39;ve been waiting for her memories to return, 
but it is so hard seeing her with Kim.&quot; 

Tanya leaned forward and placed her elbows on her knees and laced her 
fingers together, &quot;Is that why you made out with Jessica?&quot; 

Kris rubbed her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know, it all happened so quickly. It is 
not like I wanted it to happen.&quot; She stated truthfully, &quot;Jenn looked 
happy with Kim and I was so sick of being alone. I just wanted to hold 
someone.&quot; 

Tanya nodded, &quot;And Jessica offered?&quot; 

Tears welled up in the corners of her eyes, &quot;I was just giving her a 
massage, and I didn&#39;t expect things to go that direction. I never wanted 
to hurt Jenn.&quot; 

Tanya got up from her chair and strolled over to the girl and patted her 
on the back, &quot;I know you didn&#39;t. You&#39;re not that kind of person.&quot; 

Kris glanced up at Tanya, &quot;You believe me?&quot; 

Tanya nodded, &quot;Yeah, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that Jenn is 
hurting. What are you going to do about Jessica?&quot; 

Kris rubbed her fingers into her temples, &quot;I have no idea. It is so 
frustrating because I still feel deeply for Jenn, but Jessica... she is 
always there for me. I know the girl has problems, but I don&#39;t want to 
just leave her, you know what I mean?&quot; 

Tanya thought over how to respond when the door in to the stair well 
opened and Penny shyly stepped out. &quot;Well hello there.&quot; She smiled at 
Penny, &quot;You finally decided to join us?&quot; 

Penny slowly nodded and glanced around the room, &quot;S... sort of...&quot; She 
said in a tiny voice, &quot;I...&quot; She struggled to keep herself from 
trembling as Tanya stepped closer to hear her clearer, &quot;I was lo... 
looking for Kimberly.&quot;  She finished with a great sigh of relief that 
she managed to complete her sentence. 

Tanya smiled at her, &quot;She&#39;s not here right now, but I&#39;ll bet she&#39;ll be 
here sometime to get something to eat. Are you hungry?&quot; 

Penny nodded quickly, the fact was she was starving, but could not bring 
herself to saying so, but with the offer of food given she could not 
pass it down. 

&quot;Kris?&quot; Tanya turned to the girl sitting next to her. 

Embarrassed, Kris stood and wiped her hands on her slacks and offered it 
to Penny, &quot;My name is Kris and this is Tanya.&quot; When Penny did not take 
the hand she nervously rubbed it on the back of her neck and chuckled, 
&quot;I guess I&#39;m the new Dorm Head here so if you need anything just come 
and ask.&quot; She waved for the girl to follow her, &quot;There should be 
something in the kitchen, sorry about the mess.&quot; She apologized as she 
stepped over a tray on her way across the hall. 

Tanya walked beside the girl, &quot;I don&#39;t know if you have met the gang, 
but this here is Natalie.&quot; She gestured to Natalie as they approached 
the girl. 

&quot;How you&#39;ve been?&quot; Natalie asked with a smile, &quot;Kim treating you 
alright?&quot; 

Penny flushed and clenched at her dress restlessly and nodded. 

Cherilyn stopped what she was doing to greet their visitor. &quot;Hi, I&#39;m 
Cherilyn. Nice to meet you.&quot; She said with a smile, &quot;And these two would 
be Misty and Emily.&quot; She nodded to a pair of girls pushing garbage into 
an over stuffed green plastic bag. 

&quot;Evening!&quot; Misty called out as she forced another paper plate into the 
bag. 

&quot;Like wise.&quot; Emily added, tying the bag closed and wiping her brow with 
the back of her sleeve. 

Kris led the girl to the kitchen and held the swinging door open for 
her, &quot;Enter my lady.&quot; She said with a bow. 

Penny giggled as she entered the kitchen with Kris following right 
behind her. 

Cherilyn stepped up to Tanya and whispered into her ear, &quot;How&#39;d things 
go with Kris?&quot; 

Tanya shrugged, &quot;She says she didn&#39;t mean for anything to happen.&quot; She 
stated solemnly. 

Cherilyn looked the girl in the eyes, &quot;And you believe her?&quot; She asked 
in shock.

Tanya nodded, &quot;If you saw the look in her eyes you would too.&quot; 

Cherilyn nodded towards one of the tables, &quot;Why don&#39;t you help me?&quot; 

Tanya let out a fake sigh, &quot;You&#39;re such a slave driver you know?&quot; She 
laughed as Cherilyn chased after her.
