<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 14 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>      Bakra gave her a sympathetic look when she said she was leaving. Isaka was out doing 
something else, so now was her chance. &quot;Alright, let me help you get ready.&quot;

      The demon&#39;s response surprised her, but he only said, &quot;I understand that this isn&#39;t 
what you want - to be babied and treated like a demon. Even though you&#39;re no longer human, 
you&#39;re still Tsuru, still a person.&quot;

      She sighed. &quot;I will really miss you Bakra... you and Ark and Mara. I should probably 
say goodbye to them too.&quot;

      As Tsuru put on her repaired exorcist outfit and sheathed her swords, she noticed with 
some disgust that they were much lighter than before. She was no longer human, but... she 
would never drink blood - she would find a way to live without it.

      Ark gave her a swift hug and words of advice while Mara just stared up at her. &quot;Thank 
you for saving me again, Tsuru,&quot; the little girl said, suddenly breaking off a piece of her 
red jewel.

      &quot;This way, when we&#39;re close by, we can always find each other.&quot; Tsuru took it with a 
smile and gave the girl a soft kiss on the forehead.

      &quot;Thank you... all of you. I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll meet up again.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Th-that&#39;s horrible... I&#39;m so sorry Tsuru,&quot; Krystal said, giving the blue haired girl 
a hug. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize how much you&#39;d gone through.&quot;

      Isaka wasn&#39;t too happy at that, seeing how she knew that Tsuru was after her lover. &quot;I 
only did it to save you from being Carmilla&#39;s mindless puppet, you know.&quot;

      Tsuru scoffed at her. &quot;Uh-huh. That certainly doesn&#39;t explain the other time you took 
advantage of me.&quot;

      &quot;Hey, you never said &#39;no&#39;, so that wasn&#39;t my fault.&quot;

      Krystal sighed at their bickering and then looked over at Tsuru again. &quot;So... you&#39;re 
not human at all? Are you a demon or a vampire?&quot;

      Tsuru was about to answer when Isaka cut her off. &quot;Well, Tsuru&#39;s some sort of cross 
between the three, but if you give her some blood, she gets a lot stronger. And kinky-&quot;

      The demon was rewarded by a smack on the head by a blushing Tsuru. &quot;Shut up!&quot; she 
hissed out.

      Krystal looked at the two of them. &quot;So... I guess you were Isaka&#39;s last lover before 
she met me?&quot;

      Tsuru scrunched up her face. &quot;What? No way - unless Isaka stopped sleeping with girls 
for...&quot; She suddenly trailed off, embarrassed. Krystal seemed to catch.

      &quot;...Tsuru... how old are you...?&quot; 

***** 

      When they finally arrived back at Krystal&#39;s apartment, Tsuru briefly wondered why she 
followed them all the way here. She finished her story so she should be heading back to her 
own home. Tsuru took a peek out the window to see the sun ready to rise. Awesome - she&#39;d 
spent a whole night arguing, telling a story and pining after a pretty girl.

      Krystal yawned and disappeared down the hallway. Isaka glanced over at Tsuru.

      &quot;You can use the other bedroom if you&#39;re too tired to go back home.&quot;

      The blue haired girl turned around. &quot;Actually, there&#39;s something I need to talk to you 
about.&quot;

      The demon was intrigued as the former exorcist continued. &quot;I&#39;ve been seeing a lot of 
shadow beasts lately that resemble the kinds Carmilla makes-&quot;

      &quot;Oh, God. She found you again? I thought she would have given up after realizing she 
couldn&#39;t turn you into a real vampire...&quot; Isaka groaned, rubbing her temples.

      &quot;But that&#39;s just the problem - I haven&#39;t seen Carmilla but I keep getting attacked. If 
she was sending out beasts, she would have appeared and tried to seduce me or whatever. It&#39;s 
starting to worry me...&quot; Tsuru murmured, hugging herself.

      &quot;Ah, you&#39;re worried about her? I&#39;m sure Carmilla would love to hear that,&quot; the demon 
said with a grin, heading towards her and Krystal&#39;s room. &quot;It&#39;s probably not her, then. Just 
don&#39;t worry so much - we haven&#39;t seen Carmilla in... well, probably the time we fought the 
Demon Lord and that was a long time ago.&quot;

      Tsuru sighed as the demon disappeared. As she walked to the extra room, she thought 
back on the Demon Lord. That had been a fun battle... not. She decided not to think on it 
anymore and just get some rest. It was late, after all. 

***** 

      Krystal took a quick peek at her watch. She&#39;d be leaving the temple later in the 
evening in order to go over to Abby&#39;s house... it was time for that &#39;talk&#39; everyone had been 
gearing up about. She still couldn&#39;t fathom how Sakura and Abby hadn&#39;t told their daughter 
anything about the subject of relationships...

      In fact, it worried Krystal the most that they even needed to have a talk like that in 
the first place. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;

      Krystal snapped to attention at the sound of Hina&#39;s voice. &quot;Huh, oh yeah. I was just 
thinking about tonight. I&#39;m going to a friend&#39;s house.&quot;

      It was currently a break time, so Krystal had been enjoying the scenery of the 
backyard. Hina sat down next to her. &quot;Sounds like fun! Is it going to be like a party?&quot;

      &quot;Hmm, kind of...&quot; Krystal took a quick look around. &quot;Where&#39;s Tsuki?&quot; She hadn&#39;t seen 
the brunette at all.

      &quot;Oh, well she&#39;s meditating and resting again. She still isn&#39;t feeling too well, but 
big sister took care of it already,&quot; Hina murmured, looking a bit sad. &quot;Tsuki gets sick a 
lot, but big sister says it happens because she doesn&#39;t follow the rules. It always confuses 
me since I&#39;m too young understand it...&quot;

      Krystal didn&#39;t know what to say in response, but Hina continued. &quot;Tsuki got punished 
the night you came over too... sometimes I&#39;m scared of what big sister does.&quot;

      The older girl tried to brush off the conversation, but later on, when she was walking 
down the hall, she could hear sobbing. Krystal cautiously approached the door to the room 
and peered in. Tsuki was sitting on the floor, a blanket wrapped around her, crying. Her 
hair was disheveled and her sobs seemed to rack her frame.

      &quot;Tsuki?&quot; The brunette stiffened and turned around to look at Krystal. Tears were 
rolling down her cheeks and the blonde rushed over. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

      &quot;K-Krystal... I... it hurts, everything hurts!&quot; She clutched onto Krystal&#39;s shirt 
desperatedly. &quot;You have to... oh, please, God! Why, I can&#39;t... You have to get out - 
everything, all this, all this is just a... just a-!&quot;

      &quot;Tsuki.&quot;

      Krystal felt herself freeze at the harsh, commanding tone. The crying girl in her arms 
turned to look at the newcomer. When Krystal turned around, the look on Hoshi&#39;s face was 
serious and angry. Tsuki held on to Krystal tighter.

      &quot;Please, Krystal - for all of us, for all of us you have to go-&quot;

      &quot;Tsuki!&quot; The brunette shut her eyes at her sister&#39;s voice. She stood up and Hoshi 
grabbed her by the arm to lead her out of the room.

      Krystal could only stand still and watch the spectacle as they left. Before Tsuki was 
pulled out into the hall, she mouthed the word &#39;go!&#39; to Krystal. 

***** 

      It was time for her to go and honestly, Krystal was looking forward to it. After that 
freaky incident with Tsuki, she really wanted to leave.

      &quot;Krystal!&quot; She recognized that smooth voice and turned around to see Hoshi heading 
towards her. &quot;I wish to talk to you about something. Can you come back inside for a little 
bit?&quot;

      &quot;I... really need to be going, Hoshi,&quot; Krystal said, looking away from her gold hazel 
eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t want to keep my friends waiting.&quot;

      Hoshi was silent, but then said, &quot;I wanted to speak to you about Tsuki. I... know 
today may have seemed odd to you. Tsuki suffers from her inability to rein her power, so to 
speak. She has an immense amount of potential, but it&#39;s too much for her to handle.&quot;

      Krystal looked back over at the older woman as she continued. &quot;That&#39;s why I had to 
place those marks on her arm. And she always meditates to keep it under control. When it 
gets out of control, she becomes disillusioned like she did today.&quot;

      &quot;But why,&quot; Krystal cut in. &quot;Why did she tell me I needed to leave?&quot;

      Hoshi gave her a sad smile. &quot;Well, she started getting sick after you two did seals 
together, remember? When you started to release your holy power, the residue seeped into 
Tsuki, causing her own control to loosen,&quot; the older woman trailed off, thinking of her 
words. &quot;What I&#39;m... trying to say is Tsuki was trying to tell you her problem, but she was 
too drunk on her own power to think straight.&quot;

      Krystal gave a hesitant nod. &quot;Is... she going to be alright?&quot;

      &quot;Of course, she&#39;ll be fine in a bit. I&#39;m going to just ask that you stay away from her 
for a while - you have a huge well of power also, so it&#39;s affecting Tsuki in a negative 
way.&quot;

      To Krystal, that made sense. That would explain all of Tsuki&#39;s odd mannerisms soon 
after she came here and the little episode in the room. Hoshi suddenly laid a hand on 
Krystal&#39;s shoulder.

      &quot;By the way, how are you and your girlfriend?&quot; 

***** 

      Krystal looked around the room, trying to find where she left her phone. Isaka found 
it first, on the counter in the bathroom. &quot;Who are you going to call?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, I was going to see if Tsuru wanted to come along - I mean, the more the better, 
right?&quot;

      The demon laughed. &quot;I already asked her before she left. She said she would since I... 
heh, well, I kind of convinced her to come...&quot; Krystal didn&#39;t understand her girlfriend&#39;s 
devious tone and only shot her a look.

      &quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

      Isaka shrugged. &quot;Well, since we&#39;ve been going over my checkered and decorated past, I 
guess I should tell you about the time I first met Tycara. Me and Tsuru went through a bit 
of maternal hell with that girl and I&#39;m sure she&#39;d like to see Tycara again.&quot;

      The demon grinned, already predicting Tsuru&#39;s reaction to the once grown now little 
girl.
