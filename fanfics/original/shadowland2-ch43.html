<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch42.html">Back to Part 42</a><pre>Kris stepped through the washroom mirror and pulled Jenn&#39;s hand along 
with her, &quot;Careful.&quot; She warned as Jenn shakily stepped through the 
mirror onto the counter and hopped down. As soon as her feet were firmly 
upon the ground she let go of Kris&#39;s hand and started out of the 
washroom ahead of her friend, &quot;Jenn, wait up!&quot; Kris rushed after the 
girl. 

Jenn pushed through the washroom door, &quot;I want to go home.&quot; She stated 
quietly. 

Kris tried to keep pace with the girl as she quickly moved through the 
dorm halls, &quot;Jenn, will you slow down.&quot; 

Jenn stopped dead in her tracks and spun around to face Kris. Her eyes 
were filled with misery as she stared at her friend, &quot;What does Jessica 
mean to you?&quot; She bluntly inquired. 

Kris was startled by Jenn&#39;s questioning and hesitated for a moment, 
&quot;She... She is just a friend.&quot; 

Jenn slowly shook her head and her mouth quivered, &quot;Then... why did you 
hesitate?&quot; Tears filled her eyes, &quot;I saw the way you hugged her and the 
way she looks at you. You can&#39;t tell me it&#39;s just nothing.&quot;

Kris rubbed the back of her neck as guilt welled up inside of her, 
&quot;I...&quot;She never felt so ashamed of herself. 

Tears rolled down Jenn&#39;s cheeks, &quot;Did you make out with her?&quot; She 
inquired flatly.

Kris flinched at the accusation and ran a hand through her hair, &quot;Jenn 
look...&quot; She stepped closer to the girl in an attempt to hug her only to 
have Jenn shove her away. 

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Jenn cried, &quot;I wish I never remembered how I feel for you.&quot; She 
remarked sadly. 

Kris&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;You remember?&quot; She was partly excited until she 
noticed the agony upon Jenn&#39;s face. 

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I ever loved you.&quot; Jenn cried, then ran away from Kris 
down the stairwell and into the lobby. 

&quot;Jenn are you alright?&quot; The Eastern Dorm head inquired as she watched 
the crying girl rush through the lobby and out the door. Soon after Kris 
burst into the lobby, &quot;Kris?!? What happened?&quot; The Head asked the girl.

Kris only shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m just the biggest idiot in the world is 
all.&quot; She remarked sadly as she dragged her feet out of the dorm. As she 
passed through the dorm doors she could see Jenn off in the distance, 
for a moment Jenn stopped running as she trying to catch her breath. 
Kris considered catching up to the girl then reconsidered. She watched 
as Jenn continued running down the path again and waited until the girl 
disappeared into the distance before decided to follow, walking slowly 
as to give the girl some space.
