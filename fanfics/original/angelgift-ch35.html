<h1>Angel's Gift (part 35 of 36)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/angelgift-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><pre>Standing before the ceremonial altar Allison Tennison
gulped, glad the anti-nausea medication that she had
taken had finally kicked in. The bachelor party that
Kat had helped organize for her last night had
involved a lot of tall tales mixed with a lot of
booze, enough that the sandy haired young woman was
still feeling the after effects this morning.

&quot;That green shade of your face goes so well with your
uniform,&quot; Kat teased, her long brown braid hanging
elegantly down her back.

&quot;I don&#39;t look that bad,&quot; Allison protested softly.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease,&quot; Amara drawled, the former bounty hunter
standing calmly at attention with the rest of the
honor guard.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Queen Jen&#39;ai smiled, the regal black haired
woman sitting on a throne in front of them, dressed in
the vestments of the warrior goddess as suited her
role in heading up the marriage ceremony.

The grand hall had been redecorated for the wedding,
the more military style banners replaced with the
blues and golds that were traditional in this
culture&#39;s wedding ceremonies. The Empire believed in
twin war gods, male and female, and that they watched
over the newlyweds in their guise of guardians, too.
The scent of alien flowers filled the air as row upon
row of royal guests waited, along with a few familiar
faces to Allison and friends.

&quot;Thank you for doing this, ma&#39;am,&quot; Allison said
softly.

&quot;I&#39;m honored,&quot; Jen&#39;ai answered. A faint smile, &quot;And I
think I&#39;m the only person with enough authority to
marry off my willful daughter, anyway.&quot;

Sharin chuckled, &quot;Too true.&quot;

Eyes glittering with amusement Kat asked, &quot;I wonder
what your mom will think when you come home with your
bride?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m hoping she takes it well,&quot; Allison sighed wryly,
imagining her rather conservative mother&#39;s likely
reaction.

&quot;And why won&#39;t she?&quot; Sharin asked, the gorgeous blonde
decked out in full Questor gear, including revealing
bodysuit and glittering segments of armor. &quot;You&#39;re
marrying into royalty, I think she&#39;d be impressed.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s the whole marrying a woman thing,&quot; Allison said
dryly.

&quot;Ah, you have one of those cultures,&quot; Sharin nodded
wisely. &quot;If it helps, we could just skip over the
alien princess part, then.&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Allison smiled faintly.

&quot;So,&quot; Amara raised a eyebrow, &quot;have you and Milly...?&quot;

Sharin actually blushed.

&quot;Oh ho,&quot; Allison grinned, having heard from Jenna
about the catgirl Milly&#39;s romantic intentions. &quot;What
happened?&quot;

&quot;Milly decided that just pouncing on me wasn&#39;t getting
her point across,&quot; Sharin admitted, &quot;so she pounced on
me in the bedroom instead.&quot; A pause, &quot;While nude.&quot;

&quot;That would certainly clarify things,&quot; Amara
acknowledged. She saw a friendly face watching from
the front rows and waved slightly.

Commander Laurel D&#39;ken smiled back, the blue haired
officer nodding warmly. &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; a nervous voice came
from nearby, &quot;I can barely believe we&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;Allison&#39;s family and friends mostly couldn&#39;t attend,
Sam,&quot; Laurel smiled at her fellow officer, &quot;besides, I
think Allison gets along with us well enough to
consider us friends.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Lieutenant Sam C&#39;tarn acknowledged, bald head
gleaming as much as the decorations on his uniform,
&quot;but in my wildest dreams I never expected to be up
among the nobility like this.&quot;

&quot;They all put their clothes on one limb at a time,&quot;
Roma noted, the silvery skinned android sitting with
Marilyn. Both officers wore their distinctive Galactic
Patrol uniforms, this time with all their
commendations and awards added to their tunics.

&quot;This is SO cool,&quot; Marilyn nearly squealed, her
formerly blue hair now transformed to a shocking pink.

&quot;What happened to...?&quot; Lieutenant Alex Keron asked,
the black haired young man nodding towards the changed
young woman.

&quot;Her race&#39;s plumage changes when they go into mating
season,&quot; Ensign Kayla Shen answered calmly, her own
pink hair in a more orderly style.

&quot;Seriously?&quot; Alex&#39;s eyes widened.

&quot;No, I think it was a dying accident,&quot; Kayla conceded.

&quot;Don&#39;t tease the poor boy,&quot; Chief Engineer Lucas Anias
said dryly, the golden skinned Magi looking amused,
&quot;he&#39;s already run afoul of Marilyn.&quot;

Alex blushed under the other&#39;s gazes. &quot;She&#39;s a little
more aggressive,&quot; he admitted, &quot;than the females of my
home world.&quot;

&quot;Nothing wrong with being forward,&quot; Laurel drawled,
remembering with a smile her first encounter with
Amara.

&quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; Sharin warned as firmly made sure Allison
was in her place, &quot;I can feel the energy flux
starting.&quot;

It began with a shimmer in the air, then a swarm of
glittering diamonds of light blazed to life even as
she appeared, descending much as the old stories said
the goddess had done. As the slip transit effect faded
Allison caught her breath, stunned by her beauty.

Jenna looked like a goddess, her black hair flowing
over her shimmering red gown, her eyes warm with
tenderness as she took her place beside Allison. &quot;You
look stunned,&quot; she whispered, clearly pleased by her
reaction.

&quot;You&#39;re incredible,&quot; Allison said honestly, &quot;stunning,
even.&quot;

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Jen&#39;ai cleared her throat, smiling slightly.

&quot;Sorry, mother,&quot; Jenna smiled.

Taking on a formal tone Jen&#39;ai unrolled a scroll and
began to read. The tale was of a goddess fallen from
glory, rescued by a mortal born who sacrificed himself
to restore her to glory. &quot;As these partners battled
side by side,&quot; Jen&#39;ai addressed the crowd, &quot;so to do
we hope that married partners can too.&quot;

Music welled up behind her as Jen&#39;ai continued, &quot;Jenna
and Allison have faced difficulties coming here, and
in accepting their love for one another. They have
been tested in the crucible of combat, and have not
been found wanting.&quot;

&quot;Here it comes,&quot; Amara warned Allison softly.

&quot;Allison Tennison of the house Tennison of Earth,&quot;
Jen&#39;ai addressed her, &quot;do you pledge your heart and
life, your honor and soul to the Princess Jenna of the
Royal House?&quot;

&quot;I so pledge,&quot; Allison answered firmly.

&quot;Princess Jenna of the Royal House,&quot; Jen&#39;ai turned to
her, &quot;do you pledge your heart and soul, honor and
life to this woman, your beloved?&quot;

&quot;All that and more,&quot; Jenna said firmly.

&quot;With the blessings of the Pantheon of Twelve I say,&quot;
Jen&#39;ai declared loudly, &quot;that you are recognized as a
mated pair and shall never be sundered even unto
death.&quot;

&quot;Cheery,&quot; Kat noted softly.

&quot;Tradition,&quot; Sharin shrugged.

&quot;You may kiss the bride,&quot; Jen&#39;ai smiled, &quot;is I believe
the Earth custom?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Jenna purred, moving into the circle of
Allison&#39;s arms.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Allison murmured before kissing her
soulfully.
