<p>“Beautiful Place in My Heart: journey to the  west”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Even today, nearly sixty years after Earth’s last  war, China was still one of the most populated and powerful regions.  It had ceased to be a Communist country long before the war, and  while the massively unbalanced population caused occasional  fluctuations between rich economy and miserable poverty, it seemed to  have found a balance at last. Nearly half the people in the world  spoke some degree of Mandarin; they had even sent one of their own to  the moons of Jupiter, before any other country. Of course, the  Chinese did not forget their roots, and kept a large portion of their  country (and Asia in general) pristine, dedicated to their  traditions, honoring their rich culture and heritage. Marsa Rosemont  began her journey here, at Big Wild Goose Pagoda, though none of her  accomplices knew why.</p>
<p>Alala naturally jumped at the chance to accompany her  idol, and wherever she went, Yenae was sure to follow. This decision  caused the Felinis some distress, but at least not as much as it once  did. There was a consistency in Marliir’s choices, something none  of Alala’s previous love interests had, and with each day the  barrier around her heart weakened a little more. She was still  aggravated by Yenae’s flirting, but even she could no longer deny  that all the attention felt really good. Marsa was honored to have  such good company with her— but then came Valti and Chandra to  upset the balance.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing nothing for weeks on end,”  Brignor complained, dressed unusually provocatively, resembling a  Hindu goddess with uncanny accuracy. She claimed she kept it from  Franklin Hill’s wardrobe; the outfits were so gaudy that she  couldn’t possibly refuse them. “Nothing!” she yelled again to  emphasize her point. “I need an adventure as badly as I need to get  laid. Nobody’s interested in poor Valti anymore. Nobody cares.”</p>
<p>“Join the club,” Kyrie had grumbled, before setting  off on her own adventure. Marsa welcomed Valti, even though her  unpredictability was a liability. Chandra had a slightly better  reason for going: she wanted to see how a person like Marsa conducted  herself, and whether or not she, a former high priestess of Tigris,  knew anything about the mysterious correlation between sex, lust, and  love. Rebecca was the last to join, and hers was the purest reason of  them all: she wanted to test her abilities and push her limits. She  wanted to see how she would fare as an independent woman. She had  been dragging her heels, hiding in the background, and relying on  others far too much; it was time to boost her confidence and—  literally and figuratively— stretch her wings. In a sense, she was  glad that Riene wouldn’t be around. She wanted to show the woman  she loved how much she had improved during their separation.</p>
<p>“I have a few questions,” Valti said as the <em>Dauntless</em> flew away. “You know where you’re headed to, so  why didn’t you just let us drop you off there?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t do that. This is a personal pilgrimage  I must make— a sacred journey of trials and truth. How could I test  myself if I sat in your ship the entire time?”</p>
<p>“Uh, okay, I think I understand, but it would be a  whole lot faster than— ”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you do understand,” she replied.  “There’s an old saying that goes, ‘it’s not the destination  but how you get there’, or something along those lines. And anyway,  there are specific markers I must follow in order to reach the exact  place. I would not be able to find them if we flew.”</p>
<p>“Fine, okay,” Valti grumbled. So much for taking  the easy route. “Since we’re going to be on foot, you may as well  tell us what our objective is.”</p>
<p>“<em>My</em> objective is to undergo calamities as a  way of refining my spirit, and to retrieve holy sutras for personal  and public use. Yours, my friends, is whatever you would like it to  be. Come with me all the way, leave right now, or sign out midway:  it’s your decision.”</p>
<p>“Sutras from this India place?” Yenae said. “I  think I’ve heard something like this before from Fuuka. One of her  crazy cartoon shows had something along those lines.”</p>
<p>“So did one of Amy’s books,” Rebecca said. Since  she felt that getting a few clues would help their journey, she  decided to call Amy and ask about it. Miracle was surprised at  Marsa’s story, and giggled a little before replying.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, Fuuka has several favorite animes revolving  around that theme. I’m not surprised none of you know about it;  it‘s very obscure, even for Earth. Marsa’s quest is almost  exactly the same as <em>Journey to the West in the Great Tang Dynasty</em>,  one of the great ancient Chinese novels. It’s based on the exploits  of Xuanzang, a Buddhist priest that lived around 600 CE. He was  sometimes known as Genjo Sanzo and Tripitaka. He also traveled from  China to India to obtain holy sutras. In fact, if I’m not mistaken,  the building you’re in right now is said to store those same  scriptures.”</p>
<p>“So we’ll practically be following in this  Xuanzang’s footsteps.”</p>
<p>“There’s more to it than that. His journey was  romanticized about a thousand years later into an epic tale simply  called <em>Journey to the West</em>. In it, Tripitaka gathers four  disciples: a Monkey-King, a Pig-General, a Sand Priest, and a dragon  turned into a horse, but it’s still for the same purpose. As you  might expect from my description, it’s a little fantastic, and the  trials he faced were a little more extreme. Fuuka says that the anime <em>Dragon Ball</em> was loosely based on it, and they even performed a  play version in <em>Love Hina</em>.” When Rebecca announced all this,  Marsa laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“We’re doing a historical reenactment! I’m the  priest searching for holy scriptures and you’re my eclectic group  of disciples! Right down to the letter!”</p>
<p>“Hopefully without most of the calamities,” Chandra  muttered. Valti ribbed her playfully.</p>
<p>“Oh come on, you need to get out and face a little  danger; it’ll be good for you. I have a feeling it’ll be good for  all of us! Hey, ask Amy if this priest guy found any treasures.”  Rebecca posed the question, which Miracle had naturally anticipated.</p>
<p>“You mean aside from the scriptures? Well, the Monkey  King was given the <em>rúyì-j</em><em>ī</em><em>ng</em><em>ū</em><em>-bàng</em>,  or ‘will-following golden-banded staff’, which he could shrink  down to the size of a needle or expand it to gigantic proportions,  hence the will-following. It was originally a pillar supporting the  undersea palace of the East Sea Dragon King. Of course, I doubt  you’ll find anything like that on your trip…but then again,  stranger things have happened. Oh— I have to go. Riene’s just  arrived. She’s coming with us.”</p>
<p>“Tell her…” Rebecca stopped herself before she  could say anything she would regret. Tell her what? That I miss her?  I wish her luck? I’m glad she’s back? I’m crazy about her? No.  Nothing would suffice. Whatever she had to say could wait until they  met again. “Tell her I said hello,” she decided. “You all have  a safe journey, now.”</p>
<p>“You too. Look out for burning mountains and Demon  Bull Kings!” She laughed and hung up; Rebecca made a face.</p>
<p>“What is it?” Alala said. Hill smiled flatly and  put her phone away.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you on the way. I think our fearless  leader has been watching too many cartoons.”</p>
<p>“Nothing wrong with that,” Valti smiled.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to our intrepid heroines…</p>
<p>A force of pure (hilarious) evil was watching from a  distance!</p>
<p>“Ooooh…going on a little JOURNEY, huh? Gonna find  some FREAKING SCROLLS, huh?! And they’re gonna meet the freaking  DEMON BULL KING OF BURNING HATRED MOUNTAIN?! HUH!!!??  AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!! …Wait, what am I laughing about? THAT’S  NOT FUNNY AT ALL, LITTLE MUFFINS! I’M GONNA BAKE YOU AND BUTTER YOU  UP FOR MAKING ME LAUGH AT NOTHING!!! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!”</p>
<p>Snap.</p>
<p>“Uh-oh.” The branch Ferocious was perched on broke—  and when the bough breaks, the cradle will fall.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Their journey immediately got off to a rough beginning  when, about three or four kilometers into their hike, the group came  to a wide, rushing river, too deep to wade through and too fast to  swim across. They could only just see the other side, a dull patch of  brown and green crowning the crystal blue gushing before them. The  river stretched on and on no matter which direction they looked in,  and there was no bridge.</p>
<p>“We’re off to a pleasant start!” Valti noted,  crossing her arms. Alala was already trying to figure a way out; she  was good at seemingly impossible situations.</p>
<p>“When there’s no bridge available, just make one!  Let’s chop some trees down.”</p>
<p>“We could just make a raft,” Chandra noted.</p>
<p>“There wouldn’t be one big enough to hold us all.  Besides, that current’s too quick. Do we have to go directly  across, Lady Rosemont?”</p>
<p>“You can just call me Marsa,” she smiled. The holy  cat-girl approached the lake’s shore, slipping a walking stick into  the waves to measure depth and speed. Her paw nearly touched water  before she jerked the stick out, almost carried away by the water’s  fury. “I don’t know how long this river goes on, but it’s safe  to assume we can’t take the long way around, not without losing  time. A bridge it is.”</p>
<p>“Did anybody bring an axe or something?” Rebecca  asked. Valti cackled and reached into her traveling kit. Leave it up  to the good Professor to carry several hacksaws with her. Yenae paled  as she took one.</p>
<p>“I don’t even want to know why you have these with  you. Okay, which tree are we cutting?”</p>
<p>“The tallest and widest,” Alala said, scampering  through the wilderness to find the perfect specimen. Rebecca didn’t  have such mastery of her new wings that she could fly up in the air  whenever she wished; however, she could hover a little, and climbing  was considerably easier now that she had some thrust. She shimmied up  a fairly tall tree and started gliding from branch to branch like a  flying squirrel, until she came to one she liked.</p>
<p>“Here!” she shouted, waving a bright light. She  jumped off and circled down, then picked up a saw and started  cutting. The tree’s trunk was as broad as a grown man’s armspan,  nearly two meters in diameter, and even with everyone working in  tandem, it took a long time to cut down. Of course, now there was  another problem: their ideal bridge was a good distance away from the  river, and not exactly easy to carry.</p>
<p>“Alala to the rescue once more!” she exclaimed. She  asked that everyone cut wedges from the tree’s branches and prop  the massive trunk up with them, then had everyone put some of the  straighter branches underneath the space, producing a crude method of  rolling the tree down. The rollers would be interchanged as they came  out the other end, so in this fashion— with a lot of pushing,  pulling, yelling, sweating, and more than a few splinters— they  guided their bridge to the river, shoving it into the water and tying  it down on their end. The very tip of the highest branch barely  brushed against the shore on the opposite end, but the current skewed  and bent it, so the last leg of this trial would be rough. Since  Rebecca and Alala could keep the best balance, they went across  first. The tree was a little wobbly, and they nearly fell in the  drink several times, but at last they made it to the other side.  Rebecca had to hop off and straighten out the other end, then waved  her light in the air, signaling the others to cross.</p>
<p>“My turn next,” Yenae said. “Chandra, just hold  onto me and keep looking ahead. There’s no need to rush, so take  your time. I’m a great swimmer, so don’t worry if you slip.”  Chandra nervously nodded, but instead of grabbing Yenae’s  shoulders, she wrapped her arms around her tummy, like she was  sharing a motorcycle, and sidled gingerly, not even bothering to lift  her feet. Alala bravely came out and met them halfway; the wind  knocked against them, making them shriek. The Felinis caught Chandra  first and helped her the rest of the way; Yenae followed suit, having  a much easier time without her burden.</p>
<p>“Nothing to it,” Valti whistled. “Now it’s our  turn. I can’t swim well, Marsa, so I hope for your sake you have  excellent balance. But what am I saying? You’re a cat-girl!” She  smiled brightly and held four of her arms out to maintain her center  of gravity; Marsa held onto the other two from behind, using her  walking-stick as extra leverage. Suddenly, they felt the river  bucking and protesting their passage, and a great surge of water  started gushing in, slapping them fiercely and nearly throwing them  off. To make matters worse, Rebecca noticed they now had a visitor  coming towards them from the other side, and from Eve’s  descriptions, she could guess who it was.</p>
<p>“Ohhh, crap,” she muttered. The muscular bald man  in a woman’s dress cackled as he unsheathed four swords.</p>
<p>“BAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!!! Heeeeeeeeeere’s  LOOKINGATYOUKID!!!”</p>
<p>“Hurry!” Chandra yelled. Valti and Marsa were now  feeling the river’s entire fury. Something must be happening at the  source, maybe a melted block of snow or a burst dam. The water was  surging and they were only halfway across. Rebecca tried hovering  after them while Alala crawled, using her claws to keep herself fixed  on the bridge. She yelped every time she was splashed.</p>
<p>“Take my hand!” she yelled. Valti knelt down on the  bridge and grabbed hold, turning around and extending her many hands  to Marsa. The priestess caught her, but then the river finally had  enough, and battered the log. The women stumbled and Marsa fell into  the water, still clinging to Valti. She thrust her walking stick out,  and the others grabbed it and combined their strength to pull her in.  They ran to the other side just as the log started to loosen its  bonds. Ferocious was in the middle and keeping perfect balance  despite the chaos.</p>
<p>“THAT’S NO FUN, PIGGIES! Leaving me out here with  my SOAKING DRESS! I’ve got FOUR SWORDS with your names on it and—  well, they’re not literally on there, that would be WEIRD— HEY,  ARE YOU TRYING TO DISTRACT ME? AND ISN’T THIS THE MOST UNUSUAL  FREAKING WEATHER?! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!” He ran, actually ran  after them, his blades smiling brightly, laughing maniacally. Yenae  and Valti quickly took the other end of the bridge and untied it,  then everyone else gave it a kick and sent it hurtling down the  river, Ferocious clinging onto it for dear life.</p>
<p>“I DIDN’T PAY FOR THIS RIDE!! LEMME OFF! At least  give me the proper tour! KEEP YOUR HANDS INSIDE AT ALL TIMES, AND NO  FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!! Ooh, fish!” He was  thrown off and disappeared into the distance, hopefully the last they  would see of him.</p>
<p>“What the heck was that?” Marsa sputtered. Everyone  was dripping wet, but she and Alala looked the worst of the bunch.</p>
<p>“Just some nut,” Yenae muttered.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Once everyone put the river behind them, Chandra, being  Chandra, suggested they undress and take a “sky-clad” walk in the  sun for awhile until their clothes dried off. This idea was only  half-approved: everyone undressed, but they quickly put a fresh  change of clothes on, even those who had liked the idea.</p>
<p>“Mmm, I never get tired of that cute tail of yours,”  Yenae purred, giving Alala’s bare bottom a playful swat. The  cat-girl shrieked but couldn’t deny she liked it; however, for the  sake of the mission, she tried not to let her pleasure control her.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna slap that pervy face of yours if you  don’t behave yourself!”</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t be so bad,” she giggled. Alala  backed down in bewilderment.</p>
<p>“Sadist.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t so bad!” Rebecca exclaimed  enthusiastically. “Should we take a break or keep going?”</p>
<p>“We’ll put a few more kilometers behind us before  we stop,” Marsa said. “According to my map, there’s a city not  very far from here. We should make it there before dark.” None of  the travelers had any knowledge of Gaean geography (or much of  anything else related to that world), so one direction seemed as good  as another. It was kind of fun exploring the world that supposedly  “began it all” for humans— it was certainly more diverse than  anything else they had seen. After hearing a history of Gaea’s two  major space exploration movements, Rebecca and Valti (and all the  other “pure” humans aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>) had to wonder  where they came into the mix. If Gaea had only recently started  reaching for the stars, where had those other human beings come from,  how long had they been living there, and how did they arrive?</p>
<p>“There are three popular theories that I’ve heard  in my travels,” Marsa said. “The first is religious, the second  is scientific, and the third relies wholly on chance. You all know  about evolution; it’s how people explain the existence of Yenae’s  kind, and our own, and all the other ‘intelligent animal  descendents’ of the galaxy, like Fuuka and Athena. Animals evolve  and some achieve sentience. But that relies on astronomical odds  claiming that life simply sprang out from nothing on the thousands of  populated planets, and I’d rather not think of my existence as an  accident.</p>
<p>“The scientific opinion, which has become very  popular in the past century, is that there once existed a primordial  menagerie of ancestral species all living on the same world. One day,  these species, a few males and females for each, began populating and  colonizing all the planets. Human ancestors came to worlds like Gaea,  Felinis ancestors to Tigris, and so on. Now where <em>these</em> people  came from, I have no idea— maybe other galaxies, maybe through  evolution. But Gaea could very well have been ‘seeded’ by  extraterrestrials. The religious theory is, of course, that some  extra-universal deity, like a god or goddess, simply made life unique  on each world, or perhaps that original world.”</p>
<p>“What about people like me?” Chandra wondered  numbly. Marsa smiled at her.</p>
<p>“What about it? You’re human, aren’t you? You may  have been tampered with a little, whether according to your will or  against it, but that doesn’t change what you really are. You  certainly weren’t made in a factory: you have feelings and thoughts  wholly apart from the most sophisticated AI.” Many people had said  those very words to Chandra ever since she began to question herself,  but hearing them from a holy woman put everything into context. Marsa  didn’t have to worry about experience clouding her judgment: she  didn’t know Chandra at all and could speak honestly.</p>
<p>Just as Marsa was hoping, they came across a city well  before dark. Its name would mean nothing if I revealed it. The guards  carried no weapons, for they were a peaceful city, but they were all  women: something Chandra noticed at once and everyone caught onto as  they explored the city. There were plenty of men but they were not  given much prominence. They tended the fields, raised some livestock,  helped clean the city, and generally worked menial tasks. The women,  however, were viewed in high standards: they had the best clothes,  the best food, the best income, and the best positions. It was nearly  like seeing Amazonia again, except that none of the men were slaves  or studs, and the contempt was not there.</p>
<p>“Weird,” Yenae murmured.</p>
<p>“Not so much,” Marsa said, once again ready to show  off her knowledge. “There are plenty of cultures that hold one  gender or another in the highest regard. If I’m not mistaken, most  of Gaea was the reverse up until about six-hundred years ago. It  seems like a perfectly normal society otherwise.”</p>
<p>“I like it here,” Chandra smiled. But she was  gravely mistaken in her assumptions: women came first in this city,  but very few were homosexual; they regarded it as a deviation of the  norm and only permitted it to those who could not bear children. As  they explored this city, the small group learned that the founders  were descendents of a fertility cult that worshipped “the Goddess”—  that is, the child-bearing female, who only viewed men as little more  than laborers and sewers of seed. A family that had many girls was  praised; however, not having any male children was scorned. In a  sense, this practice was the most logical to assume if you wanted a  large population quickly. One man could impregnate very many women,  and then work to sustain them. Since ladies were held in much higher  regard, the travelers were granted permission to rest in the city,  but their Queen craved an audience.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable!” Chandra spat as she flopped on her  bed. “I’ve been running around this city since we came here and  there aren’t enough lesbians to fill a closet! What’s wrong with  everybody?!”</p>
<p>“Maybe they just don’t swing that way,” Marsa  smirked.</p>
<p>“Or maybe they think it inhibits breeding,” Alala  suggested. “I’m sure that if they found a way to mate with other  girls like we did, there’d be a lot more.”</p>
<p>“So how <em>do</em> the Felinis on your world breed?”  Rebecca said as she sat up. “I’ve always been curious about that.  Do you…you know…keep something hidden, or…”</p>
<p>“How am I supposed to know?!” Alala growled as her  face turned bright purple. “My mothers never told me and I was too  embarrassed to ask!”</p>
<p>“Maybe we could find out while we’re here,” Yenae  cooed as she hugged her. Alala bashed her face with a pillow and  kicked her away.</p>
<p>“You sleep on the floor!!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Despite being thrown around by a raging river,  Ferocious recovered with phenomenal speed and quickly resumed his  pursuit. Unlike most hunters, he didn’t rely on any of the  civilized means— footprints, likely hiding places, traps, waiting  in ambush— he simply plowed through whatever was in his way with an  unbreakable will and an unquenchable thirst for battle. His was a  mind pure with madness— nobody knew if he had really been driven  insane by looking at Origin, or if he had simply been this way all  his life— the only driving force that kept him going was the  indefatigable lust of swinging his swords around, cutting whatever  was in his way, and laughing about it. In a sense, he was even more  terrifying than the Dutchman, for van der Decken could be controlled  and predictable, to a point, but Ferocious was indescribable. He only  obeyed if there was a fight to be had and could only be counted on to  kill and destroy.</p>
<p>Even he was not so brainless as to ignore the trail his  prey made. He followed it as best he could in the glimmering twilight  and came across the city they were staying in to reward his efforts.  Even if they moved on, he reasoned, he could interrogate a few people  and simply kill the rest (if he was even capable of that civility),  so he ran towards the city at full speed, yelling and chortling as he  drew out five swords. Ferocious could fight with eight at the most,  but this was incredibly dangerous for himself and everyone around  him, and he had only attempted it once: the results were ghastly and  he didn’t have much fun. Five was pushing it, but it had been a  long time since his last kill; he needed to feel that godly sensation  again.</p>
<p>“KNOCK KNOCK, ANYBODY HOME?!” he yelled, battering  down the city gates. He burst through, scattering chips and debris  everywhere, killing the two guards with a single flick of the wrist.  “Honey, I hope you have a fresh turkey in the oven! The boss is  COMING FOR DINNER and…OH MY GOD, YOU BURNT THE TURKEY!!! BAD EVIL  WOMAN! DO YOU WANT ME TO GET FIRED! Fire, get it? Fired— burnt—  ROAST DUCK!!! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!” Ferocious never made any  sense when he was on a rampage, but his actions made up for his  babble: he slaughtered by the dozen, flinging his swords around like  a fierce gale, cutting down masses in seconds. Alarms went off and  the town guard charged him— they were cleaved apart and rivers of  blood flowed through the city.</p>
<p>“I WISH I WAS IN DIXIE, HOORAY! HOORAY! Hey, POPS!  Where’s the freaking DONUT SHOP?! I can’t wake up in the morning  without my freaking DONUTS, now can I?! Oh, can’t anybody tell me  where I can find them?! DONUTS AND WARM FREAKING CRESCENT ROLLS!!!  AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!”</p>
<p>He paused to admire his work, his face covered by an  enormous, savage smile. Bodies laid sprawled, hacked, ripped, torn,  and dismembered all around him. Not a single person had survived his  onslaught. He growled with satisfaction and began searching the city,  like a panther bloated on its kill, checking every home and building  he had missed. With his bloodlust satisfied for the moment, Ferocious  remained generally harmless, content to pop his head through doors  and windows, asking for the group he had been ordered to kill.</p>
<p>“Yoo-hoo! Anybody in there? I’m, uh, looking for  these people, see— BANG, BOOM, THEY’LL BREAK YOUR WORLD APART IF  YOU LET THEM!! …I mean, um, there’s probably a large group. Uh…I  think they may have passed this way…WEARING A DUCK FOR PANTS AND  HIGH HEELS IN THEIR EARS, EATING NAILS OFF THE RAILROAD…HELLO, MILK  MAIDS! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!! …Uh, so, you’ll tell me if you see  them, right?”</p>
<p>Someone tried to shoot him with a gun. His swords  deflected the bullet and he rushed the sniper angrily, picking her up  and glaring into her eyes. He bent the barrel of her shotgun with his  bare hand and demanded, “Have you hugged your full metal jacket  lately? OR HOW ABOUT A LONG SHAFT OF STEEL, BABY?!” He impaled her  and sent her body flying; a child that had been left on the corner  suddenly ran up to him and kicked him in the shin.</p>
<p>“OUCH!!!” he cried, suddenly grabbing his leg. “You  little PUNK! DIDN’T YOUR MOMMY TELL YOU THAT SORT OF VIOLENCE CAN  SCAR A PERSON?! Uh, but seriously, uh…I’m looking for these  people…”</p>
<p>“Go away!” he snapped. “Leave us alone! They  already left us yesterday! Go bother them! Just get out of here!!”  Ferocious stood in the corpse-filled streets for a long time, waiting  for his empty brain to churn out enough juice to comprehend this.</p>
<p>“Uhh…they already left?”</p>
<p>“Yesterday!!”</p>
<p>He paused again, dumbfounded. Whoops.</p>
<p>“Uh, right. Carry on, everyone. It seems I, uh…YOU  CAME A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT, DIDN’T YOU?! LITTLE PUNK KIDS  SHOULDN’T KICK ME IN THE FREAKING KNEECAP!! Go home to your  grandma, kid— IF I DIDN’T THROW HER FREAKING GUTS ALL OVER THE  CITY!! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!! …Uh, but seriously, thanks for the  info. Sorry I bothered you all…heheh.” And without further delay,  Ferocious ran out of the city as fast as he could.</p>
<p>Although Marsa and her followers managed to escape  certain death at the hands of a lunatic, they were by no means safe.  The morning light they were thrust into as soon as the Queen and her  consorts saw them off did not help save them from the trap they fell  into. As they walked through a forest, an immense net suddenly caught  them and hoisted them high into the air. This would not be much of a  problem, but for the sticky solution the rope was made of. No amount  of struggling could free them from the snare, and plenty of shouting  and cursing rose up as the group tried. Alala got her fur caught in  the sticky rope and screamed as she pulled on it; Rebecca had her  wings to worry about; Valti’s arms were tangled everywhere. Chandra  kept her cool— she had been tied up many times before, and getting  sticky was nothing new to her— and Marsa sat patiently, waiting for  the devious trap-makers to show themselves.</p>
<p>“Feels like we’re flies caught in a web,” Yenae  grunted. Valti suddenly lit up as she heard this, remembering a  previous sticky experience she had been through.</p>
<p>“Of course! This is just the kind of thing the  Arachne do!”</p>
<p>“The who?”</p>
<p>“Arachne, spider-women from the planet of the same  name. I researched them a lot back in my younger days. Fascinating  people. Their society is entirely composed of women, you know.”</p>
<p>“Lesbians?” Chandra squealed hopefully. Valti  laughed.</p>
<p>“Some of them, yes. But they mostly go after men.”</p>
<p>“Uh, this is a really stupid question,” Rebecca  said, “but by ‘go after’, you wouldn’t happen to mean…”</p>
<p>“Well, where do you think we are now?” she asked.  The white-haired maiden grumbled.</p>
<p>“Just perfect. They don’t suck their blood or  anything, do they?”</p>
<p>“No, no, they’re not monsters. They raise animals  for that. The men they just keep around for sex.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t sound too bad,” Chandra shrugged.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but remember Melena? They kind of have the  same aggression. From what I hear, though, it’s an incredible few  hours, while it lasts. The men all die with smiles on their faces.”</p>
<p>“Forget that, then!” Chandra bleated. “I’m  getting out of here!”</p>
<p>“You’re wasting your time,” Valti said. “These  cords are so thick that even if I could get to them, my hacksaws  wouldn’t be able to cut them. They’re fireproof and waterproof,  too, although I hear there’s a certain corrosive that will break  them.”</p>
<p>“So?! Break it out, professor!”</p>
<p>“Bad idea. I might scald one of you in the process.  We’ll just have to wait for the Arachnes to set us free. Don’t  worry, they’re good people— just not particularly good wives.  Poor things.”</p>
<p>“But won’t they want to…<em>do </em>that with us?”  Alala gulped.</p>
<p>“Of course not! We’re not men, are we? Oh, wait—  you two can get other women pregnant, can’t you? Wow, sucks to be  you, huh?”</p>
<p>“I swear,” Alala growled, “I’m going to scratch  you <em>so hard</em> if we manage to get out of here!” They didn’t  have to wait long, fortunately. Four of the Arachnes crept through  the forest with the frightening grace of spiders, their eight legs  moving in perfect harmony. Their lower part was all spider, but from  the waist up, they were rather beautiful women, naked and happy. The  leader, an older female with tribal tattoos on her pale skin, noticed  one of their traps had been sprung, and began singing in a strange  language. The others sang along, but then the smallest pointed to the  net, her voice trilling like a bird’s. The Arachnes were apparently  noticing they had captured the wrong gender, and one of them climbed  a tree, spun out to the net, and released it very gently. She spoke  three syllables and the cords loosened their hold, freeing their  captives.</p>
<p>“I wish Riene were here,” Yenae sighed as the  Arachne bleated at them. “I can’t understand a word they’re  saying. Valti?”</p>
<p>“Hold on, it’s been a long time since I studied  them. No, I’m not one of you! Darn it— hold on. Hope I get this  right.” She attempted to answer them, first insisting that she was  not an Arachne in spite of her eight limbs, and second explaining who  they were and what they were doing. The leader was obviously sorry  for the mistake— she bowed and clapped her hands together— and  gave them leave to continue. Now that she could see the Arachne up  close, Chandra could easily understand why some people would enjoy  copulating with them, even if it killed them. They were neither  disgusting, frightening, or misshapen in any way: these creatures  were beautiful, kind, and magnificent, almost enough to make her  forget what she had heard and join them in a little romp.</p>
<p>“So are we safe?” Marsa asked as a lull broke in  the conversation. Valti stretched her back gingerly.</p>
<p>“As long as we stick to a different road, yes. The  one we’re on right now is littered with webs like this.”</p>
<p>“I mean, Alala and myself.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh sure, sure. Even if I could tell them what  you can do in their language, which I can’t, I don’t think they’d  care. They’re only interested in human men and, if they can’t  have that, other Arachne. I think they’d just look at an  Arachne-Felinis crossbreed as something of an anathema.”</p>
<p>“Thank Goddess,” she sighed, and Alala sighed with  her. The Arachnes sang to them as they left, and Valti didn’t have  the capacity or the heart to translate; it sounded too beautiful.</p>
<p><em>Meanwhile…</em></p>
<p>“Hey, gimme down from here! Hey! HEY!! Little  butterflies like me shouldn’t be kept HANGING AROUND!! GET IT!!?  BUTTERFLIES!! If you don’t let me go right now, my swords won’t  be responsible for…ooh, spider-ladies! Hey down there! NAKED SPIDER  WOMEN SHOULD LISTEN TO THEIR LAWNMOWERS BEFORE COMING OUT TO PLAY  CHECKERS! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>The next few days were by far the most interesting.  There seemed to be at least one major trial or peril every day—  some meant for the group to overcome as a team, others designed, it  seemed, specifically to test certain individuals. Alala had to fight  through snares, traps, and confining places, Chandra’s willpower  was put to the test against a traveling harem, Valti had to recall  her studies in one incident involving animal disease, Yenae fought  off bounty hunters, and Rebecca was thrown into the fire as she  battled a giant preying mantis by herself. There was also something  about a mountain in flames and an iron fan they needed to put it out,  but this was just one incident in a long string of unpredictable,  exasperating events. The women could certainly say the tasks  strengthened them.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy part happened a few days after the  “mountain of fire” incident, which had required a little cunning  on Yenae’s part and a lot of seduction on Chandra’s. Rebecca was  just storing her new Iron Fan away and Chandra was wishing she could  bathe for the tenth time, when they came across a small cliffside  temple and decided to rest. Aside from the building itself, the view,  and the wild gardens that led to it, the only thing of interest was a  decaying bronze statue standing watch over the area. The image it had  been sculpted in was almost completely worn away by time, elements,  and vandals, but they could still see an inscription below it. The  letters were in Chinese and Hindi, but Alala had some skill at  reading them.</p>
<p>“It reads, ‘Come this way, pilgrim, to receive  truth; go back the way you came, pilgrim, to deliver it.’ I guess  it was put up not long after that Xuanzang guy completed his task.  That’s my guess, at any rate, or else it’s just a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“It certainly looks like it was made to represent a  Buddhist monk,” Marsa noted. “See, he’s wearing their  traditional robes, and he’s carrying a staff.”</p>
<p>“Do you think this is the will-following staff?”  Valti joked as she reached up to touch it. Everyone found a place to  sit down and spread some rations around. This was a serene place  where travelers could rest without fear, a shelter in bad weather and  a beacon of encouragement for the weary. Even the gardens were  bearing wild fruit; Chandra tasted a few and gathered some. Yenae  sniffled, blew her nose, and asked how much further it would be.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re not in India yet, but I’d say…we’ve  crossed over the worst of it. That shortcut those Arachne people gave  us sure was helpful. We’re certainly at least a quarter of the way  finished— that’s about halfway to India.”</p>
<p>“And so far no sign of treasures,” Valti sighed.  Marsa munched on her rations solemnly.</p>
<p>“It was not my task to find treasures. I told you,  this is my mission, not yours. If you only travel in search of  material wealth, you will never be satisfied.”</p>
<p>“I’m just saying, is all,” she shrugged. “That  is why most of us came on this voyage.”</p>
<p>“Treasure?!” screamed a voice nearby. Something  fell out of a nearby tree, a bulgy pink lump with a tattered cloth  and several leaves and branches stuck on. The lump wriggled to its  feet, shook itself off, drew four swords, and grinned avariciously.  “Is that what this is all about?! Freaking gold and diamonds? You  mean I’ve been sent to kill treasure hunters!? OH, THE TRAGIC STORY  OF BEING A LIVING WEAPON! See this heart-wrenching drama while you  still can! KIDDIES GET IN FREE! AAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAAA!!!”</p>
<p>Ferocious threw himself at them without a moment’s  pause; it was sheer luck none of them were eviscerated. Flying proved  useless as Ferocious threw his swords at Rebecca with deadly  accuracy, and hiding in the shrine was futile as Ferocious chopped at  the pillars and boards indiscriminately. Yenae threw her knives and  Valti attacked with her saws, but Ferocious managed to hold them back  with one sword, while he swung with another. Brignor was sliced on  the abdomen but the cut wasn’t bad; she groped herself and winced.</p>
<p>“Who the hell <em>are</em> you? And why are you  following us?”</p>
<p>“I’m not following!!” he screamed, dancing and  whirling out of control. “You’re just going in the same direction  I am! YOU’RE REVERSE-FOLLOWING ME!!!” His attacks intensified;  there was no way any of them could defend themselves. They couldn’t  even run: for a man wearing a dress, Ferocious was blindingly fast,  and his swords had a chain on them, so he could throw and swing at a  great distance. Half the shrine and most of the gardens were  decimated in minutes; everyone tried staying one step ahead of him,  but with the cliff on one side and their maniacal enemy on the other,  it was practically impossible. Eventually he cornered Chandra, who  tried distracting him by flashing her chest. He made a face and swung  with a lecherous grin, but his arm suddenly went limp. A dagger had  been thrust into it, care of a last-ditch effort by Yenae. Ferocious  glared at her, then pulled the dagger out with his teeth, licking his  blood.</p>
<p>“FINGER-LICKING GOOD!!” he screamed, barreling  after her. She ducked behind the rotting state just as he sent three  swords crashing down at once. They broke through the bronze easily,  but came to a crashing halt as they bounced against the statue’s  staff. Ferocious shivered as the recoil overwhelmed him, and stood  swaying as he tried to regain his equilibrium. Something about that  staff…</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness, it can’t be,” Marsa muttered.  Valti gawked.</p>
<p>“I was only kidding!” She decided to go for broke  and made a run for the staff while Ferocious was still dizzy. He  tried moving after her, but fell over backwards. Valti took the staff  in both hands and pulled it out of the statue’s fingers, holding it  and testing its weight. It felt like an ordinary bronze rod to her,  but if it could repel that madman’s attacks…</p>
<p>“I must be crazy,” she exclaimed. “But what the  hey! I was crazy to begin with, right? Staff get longer!” To her  amazement, the bronze rod expanded in length, striking Ferocious on  the forehead just as he sat up. The knock on the head was  surprisingly effective: it actually pushed him back and made him even  dizzier. Valti squealed like a kid with a new toy.</p>
<p>“Smaller!” she exclaimed, and it shrunk to the size  of a needle. Before she could play with it anymore, Ferocious stood  up, a little wobbly, weaving like a drunk as he staggered towards his  prey.</p>
<p>“You won’t…eat…my pic-a-nic basket, Ranger Bob!  Not even…feed it…to a bear! Ha, ha, ha…”</p>
<p>“INAKCHOK!” Valti screamed. The staff shot out and  rammed Ferocious in the gut, carrying him over the edge and then  slithering back to its original shape. After that, the dazzled  cross-dresser had nowhere to go but down.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Marsa Rosemont sighed dreamily as she soaked in the  pool. It was rare to find a clean body of water out in the wilderness  like this, and after everything she had been through, Marsa felt she  deserved to take advantage of it. A nice, long bath sounded like the  perfect reward, but she chose to bathe alone: she also wanted to  observe ritualistic cleansing. They were roughly three-fourths into  their journey to India and were taxed by the rough road; a few of  them even thought about leaving and resuming other obligations. Marsa  had told them several times that there would be no hard feelings if  they left her, although she would miss the company. They were not her  disciples and this was not their quest; she was the only one with a  genuine obligation.</p>
<p>Now that she was thinking about it, perhaps it was time  to part ways with them and continue alone. They had been a great  help, and together they overcame what felt like the worst of all the  disasters, but they were weary and in need of a change— and  besides, they had their group to return to. Yes, she decided: she  would sever her ties with them and wish them well. From here on out,  she would walk alone. She stepped out of the pool, wrapping a towel  around her furry body, resolved to confront them. As she dried  herself off, Marsa’s sharp cat eats picked up the sound of  something slithering through the wilderness towards her. She  stiffened cautiously— she had no means of defending herself and her  companions were far away— and looked for a safe place to hide. The  pool was a death-trap— what if the creature could swim?— and the  foliage around her was too thick to run in; besides, she was naked.</p>
<p>Everything happened so quickly after this that words  really could not do it any justice. A large serpent emerged from the  foliage, half-slithering inside the pool, its hood wide open and its  mouth yawning in hunger. Marsa yelped and stumbled away, tripping on  the ground, her towel rippling away. The serpent, easily five or six  meters in length, its head alone as large as its prey, darted towards  her like a bolt. Marsa clenched her eyes shut— it was incredible  that she would die here, in this manner, of all things— but the  great Felinis gods saw fit for her to live another day, and sent a  savior to destroy the creature.</p>
<p>She heard a strong, deep voice say, “It’s okay.  It’s dead now. You’re safe.” She gradually opened her eyes and  saw two things that startled her: one was the serpent, its head  chopped off and its body pinned down by a sword; the other was her  apparent deliverer, sitting on the grass with his back to her. A  large green cloak had been laid on the ground for her use; he was  clearly being considerate and waited patiently for her to dress.</p>
<p>“Take it,” he said.</p>
<p>“M-my clothes aren’t far away,” she muttered.  Marsa was still a little frightened, but she regained her senses (and  her clothes), and approached the man. Although he was reclining, she  could tell he had a powerful build, and bore the face of a King:  noble, beautiful, but with worries carved on his face and a distant  expression in his dark eyes. He was dressed with very royal clothes,  somber and quiet to reflect the regal bearing he had and the grave  expression he now adapted. He finally stood up once he was satisfied  with Marsa’s state of dress, and pulled his sword from the  serpent’s body.</p>
<p>“Thank you for saving me,” Marsa whispered.</p>
<p>“You are welcome,” he replied as he cleaned the  blood off. “May I ask where you are headed?”</p>
<p>“To India. I’m on a pilgrimage— a sacred  journey.”</p>
<p>“And are you by yourself?”</p>
<p>“No, not up until now. But I feel it’s time to cut  my ties and resume my travels alone. It would be best for us all.”</p>
<p>“Must you make the journey on foot?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well, I’m not forbidden to have a beast of  burden…”</p>
<p>“The road from here to India does not get any  easier,” he said, gazing directly into her eyes. Marsa felt herself  weaken under his stare, but it was not a discomforting feeling at  all. It was like looking at the wisest, most experienced person the  galaxy had to offer: a somber, reflective man who had seen it all,  and could approach any situation reasonably and prudently. “To  travel it alone,” he continued, “would be nearly impossible. If  it will not trouble you, I could accompany you there. I know the land  very well and could help you overcome some obstacles.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t want to trouble you,” she replied  softly.</p>
<p>“There would be no trouble. I have no important  business to attend to. Besides, I could not let you proceed by  yourself with a clear conscience. As I said, I know this road: it can  be deadly if you’re not careful.”</p>
<p>“So I’ve noticed,” she smiled. “Well then, if  it is no trouble, and if I am not imposing on your obligations, I  would be honored to have you. I am Marsa Rosemont, ex-priestess of  Tigris.”</p>
<p>“And I…Hendrick van der Decken, at your service.”  He bowed deeply, impressing her.</p>
<p>“Well then, Lord van der Decken, if you will permit  me to inform my companions of my decision, I shan’t be long.”</p>
<p>“Of course. I will wait here for you.” As  Barbarossa watched her go, he took a deep breath and sighed. He  always was a sucker for these kinds of people. “Well, so much for  finding Marliir and Brignor.”</p>
