<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch44.html">Back to Part 44</a><pre>Jenn banged through the Western Dorm doors and abruptly stopped, her 
eyes darting around the room. 

&quot;Jenn, are you alright?&quot; Tanya asked seeing the distraught look upon the 
girl&#39;s face. 

Jenn shook her head as she cross the lobby towards her friend, 
&quot;Tanya...&quot; She let out a tired sob and grabbed the front of Tanya&#39;s 
shirt, &quot;Kris...&quot; She sobbed, &quot;Kris... and... Jessica... It was true...&quot; 
Again she let out an anguished sob. 

Tanya glared at Jessica, &quot;You...&quot; She snarled, &quot;How could you?&quot; 

Jessica staggered backwards, &quot;I... I... didn&#39;t mean to...&quot; She 
stammered. 

Misty gave the girl a disappointed look, &quot;That&#39;s what was bothering you 
this morning, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; She inquired, &quot;You were horny because of Kris, 
that is why you came to me.&quot; 

Jessica shook her head in dismay, &quot;You don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s not like 
that.&quot; Jessica protested. 

&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Alyson spoke up, &quot;Here I thought Kima was bad news.&quot; 

&quot;Alyson!&quot; Natalie glared at the girl causing her to fall silent. 

&quot;I knew I shouldn&#39;t have let myself fall in love with you.&quot; Misty 
swallowed hard. 

&quot;Misty...&quot; Jessica approached the girl. 

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot; Misty backed towards the stairs, &quot;Just don&#39;t...&quot; She ran up the 
stairs and headed straight for her room. 

Jessica glanced at Tanya and Jenn then rubbed her eyes, &quot;Why does this 
keep happening?&quot; She struggled against her own tears, &quot;I never wanted to 
hurt anyone.&quot; 

&quot;Well you have.&quot; Tanya snapped. 

&quot;Tanya don&#39;t...&quot; Jenn said in a thin tiny voice, &quot;It&#39;s my fault...&quot; 

&quot;No it isn&#39;t!&quot; Tanya exclaimed holding the girl tight, &quot;You don&#39;t 
deserve this. She is the one to bla-&quot; 

Jenn placed a hand over Tanya&#39;s mouth, &quot;Tanya please...&quot; She begged, &quot;I 
just want to go to my room.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll help you.&quot; Cherilyn offered, moving to Jenn&#39;s side and helping the 
girl to her feet. The three girls headed upstairs. 

&quot;Well this is turning out to be an interesting day.&quot; Amy remarked 
glancing at Jessica, &quot;Seems like you&#39;ve caused a lot of damage today.&quot; 

Jessica slid down the wall until her legs were curled up to her chest, 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She buried her face between her knees, &quot;Someone kill me.&quot; 
She muttered dismally, &quot;Please just end this misery.&quot;
