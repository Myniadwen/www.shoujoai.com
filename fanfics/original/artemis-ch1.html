<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 1 of 19)</h1>

<pre>&quot;Another beer,&quot; the boyish redhead called out her
order from the end of the bar.

&quot;You might want to go easy on that,&quot; Circe said, the
blonde beauty smiling down at her gently, &quot;I think
you&#39;ve had enough.&quot;

She looked up, tears glistening in the corners of her
eyes as she said softly, &quot;I still feel the pain, so
it&#39;s not been enough.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s your name, kid?&quot; Circe asked, putting the
bottle of beer down in front of her.

&quot;Sue,&quot; she sighed, quickly twisting the cap off of the
beer as she anticipated, &quot;and no, I don&#39;t want to talk
about it.&quot;

Circe shook her head, turning to scan the bar and
check on the other patrons. She smiled as her gaze
lingered on the back wall and the massive mural that
was painted up on it. The woman stood in the forest,
drawing a bow back smoothly, her slim athletic body
scarred and battered. Still she was beautiful, a
warrior facing her enemies with strength and courage.
Just below the image a simple line of text read, &#39;The
Daughters of Artemis.&#39;

There were several vampires eyeing each other
cautiously, but the truce over the bar seemed to be
holding. A succubis danced on one of the tables but
she had been wise and took her shoes off, so that was
all right. Other than that it was just the usual mix
of dabblers and magically touched people who occupied
the tables.

The tawny haired young woman made her way through the
crowd without any seeming effort, her very presence
enough to move the people aside. She flashed a cocky
grin as she reached the bar, her leathers hugging an
athletically slim body. &quot;Hello, love,&quot; she bent
forward across the bar to kiss Circe gently on the
lips.

&quot;Diana,&quot; Circe smiled at her lover, &quot;what kept you?&quot;

Diana placed gloved hands on the top of the bar and
vaulted over in a single smooth motion. &quot;Don&#39;t scold
me,&quot; she protested, &quot;it wasn&#39;t my fault.&quot;

Circe raised a single eyebrow, &quot;What happened this
time?&quot;

&quot;The cutest little thing tried to pick me up,&quot; Diana
leaned against the bar casually as she told her lover,
&quot;too bad she ended up being a he.&quot;

Circe snickered softly, &quot;What did you do?&quot;

&quot;Bought her a beer to apologize for the confusion,&quot;
she laughed. Diana looked around the bar with a false
sort of casualness, &quot;You know about Susan and Erin?&quot;

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Circe nodded slightly.

The couple was a mild scandal in the community, in all
honesty. The black haired vampiress Susan had taken up
with a common waitress, and a not terribly beautiful
one at that. Of course once you met Erin, none of that
mattered. Even with her short brown hair in a
ponytail, brown eyes behind comfortable glasses, and
lanky frame she was so kind and engaging it quickly
won you over. Still, there were a lot of girls who had
their sights on Susan and having her becoming
unavailable had made a lot of them very irritable.

&quot;We don&#39;t take sides in this sort of thing,&quot; Circe
firmly reminded Diana as she added, &quot;we&#39;ve always kept
the bar neutral.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s gone beyond just a few pranks around Erin,&quot;
Diana said to her seriously, &quot;someone took a shot at
beating her up.&quot;


&quot;Doesn&#39;t she teach self defense on the side?&quot; Circe
smirked.

&quot;Yeah, they certainly ended up regretting that plan,&quot;
Diana agreed, &quot;but I don&#39;t like seeing things like
this happening.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re far too compassionate,&quot; Circe murmured, taking
a damp cloth and wiping off the bar. She thought for a
moment before saying, &quot;Let&#39;s put the word out, then.
If we hear about anyone taking a shot at the two of
them, they&#39;ll get permanently banned from the
Daughters. That should make a few people think twice.&quot;

&quot;You got that right,&quot; a pretty blonde noted as she
came up with a empty mug. Her face was beautiful even
with the slight scar she bore and the dress she wore
revealed her entire back and the glinting, metallic
gold tattoo that covered it.

&quot;Refill, Elizabeth?&quot; Diana asked as she took the mug
from her hand.

&quot;Please,&quot; Elizabeth purred, leaning forward a bit to
reveal the swell of her breasts.

With an admiring smile Diana watched Elizabeth saunter
back to her party, hips swaying. &quot;That Jess Drake does
good work,&quot; Circe noted, taking in the golden tattoo.

&quot;That wasn&#39;t what I was looking at,&quot; Diana laughed.

&quot;Bad girl,&quot; Circe grinned back.

Up the bar Sue was drunkenly talking to a slim, blonde
haired young woman, &quot;Not only did she have an affair,
but they kicked me out of our carpool, too.&quot;

&quot;Poor dear,&quot; she murmured, studying Sue thoughtfully.
She smiled slightly, taking in the muscle under her
T-shirt as she said, &quot;I&#39;m Lina, by the way.&quot;

Sue blinked at her drowsily. &quot;Hey Lina,&quot; she tried to
straighten up a bit, &quot;are you doing something later
tonight?&quot;

Lina reached out to squeeze the muscle in Sue&#39;s arm.
&quot;I guess I am know,&quot; she answered,. enjoying the happy
look that spread across Sue&#39;s face.

In another part of the bar the succubus smoothly
stepped down from the table top, the buzzcut young
blonde grinning impishly. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Hunter said,
enjoying the sensation of a lingering hand resting on
her firm bottom.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Dr. Katherine Delafield murmured,
the older woman&#39;s face just a bit pale as she met
Hunter&#39;s amused gaze. She quickly removed her hand
from the jeans covered flesh, silently cursing her
lack of self-control.

Hunter stood closely to the older woman, the crowd
around the table easing off now that she had stopped
her wild dancing. &quot;You could just have left that hand
there,&quot; Hunter said to her in a husky voice, &quot;I didn&#39;t
really mind.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what came over me,&quot; Katherine turned her
face away, cheeks red.

Hunter reached up, gently stroking a red cheek as she
murmured to her, &quot;Oh, I think I know what came over
you... I did.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not....&quot; Katherine shook her head.

&quot;Do you have to be?&quot; Hunter asked, moving slightly
towards Katherine, the musky scent of her body washing
over her. &quot;You&#39;re a beautiful lady,&quot; she said as she
dropped her voice to a sultry purr, &quot;and that&#39;s
enough.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m old enough to be your mother,&quot; Katherine shook
her head woozily.

&quot;Then you were an awfully young mom,&quot; Hunter&#39;s voice
washed over her, that breath stroking feverish skin.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; Katherine asked, meeting Hunter&#39;s
eyes.

Hunter pulled her close, their bodies fitting together
perfectly, &quot;Just you,&quot; she answered, licking
Katherine&#39;s neck with a quick stroke of her tongue.

&quot;Looks like you win the bet,&quot; the pale vampiress noted
as the three women watched them leaving the bar
together. Nocturne sipped at the red fluid filling her
glass, the brown haired woman enjoying watching the
people going by.

&quot;It was nothing,&quot; Dominique waved casually, her red
hair flowing around her. The leather clad woman made a
face, &quot;Unlucky in love but good at gambling.&quot;

&quot;Mistress,&quot; Natasha gently chided her, the brunette
maid still dressed in her black silk maid&#39;s uniform
with white apron. She tilted her head slightly, &quot;You
know that Lisa cares for you.&quot;

&quot;As long as I pretend to be a human woman and hide my
true form,&quot; Dominique sighed. She brightened slightly
as she looked over at Nocturne, &quot;And how is your
Anne?&quot;

Nocturne actually blushed slightly, her pale form
highlighting the rush of blood. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;
she asked unconvincingly.

Natasha smoothly poured, refilling their wine glasses
as she said, &quot;The young lady comes over regularly now
and I doubt it&#39;s just to be your bedmate.&quot; Finished
she settled down on her knees beside the table, the
image of a perfect servant.

&quot;I&#39;ve told you all about my woes with Lisa,&quot; Dominique
reminded her with a smile, &quot;not that you haven&#39;t had a
ringside seat.&quot;

Nocturne took a drink, stalling for time. &quot;I care
about her,&quot; she finally conceded, &quot;maybe I even love
her.&quot; A sigh, &quot;But I don&#39;t know how she feels.&quot;

&quot;Have you tried asking her?&quot; Natasha asked softly, her
white maid&#39;s cap shining in the carefully dim light of
the bar.

&quot;An easy thing to say,&quot; Dominique murmured, her
thoughts on her own situation ass she added, &quot;but
harder to do.&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t spent much time away from the bedroom,&quot;
Nocturne conceded with a faint blush, &quot;for all I know
she considers me just to be a bedmate.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Natasha shook her head, &quot;from when
I have spoken to her I&#39;m certain that Anne regards you
fondly.&quot; She smiled wryly, &quot;But I don&#39;t know if she
loves you.&quot;

&quot;Then maybe I should take her out,&quot; Nocturne mused
aloud, &quot;and give her the chance to get to know me a
bit better....&quot;

Back up at the bar Circe wiped the counter off, a
smile on her face. &quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Diana asked
curiously, kneeling down to stock the fridge with
bottles of beer.

&quot;Just wondering how they&#39;d react to knowing who we
really are,&quot; Circe admitted.

Diana chuckled softly, &quot;What, that you&#39;re the original
sorceress Circe and I&#39;m the former goddess Artemis?&quot;
She looked out at the bar patrons fondly as she
murmured, &quot;Either they wouldn&#39;t believe us or just not
really care.&quot;

That brought a laugh from Circe, &quot;You know, you could
be right.&quot;

Author&#39;s Notes: This is set in the same world as
&quot;Blood, Sex and Magik&quot; and &quot;Descent&quot; and features
characters from both of those series. I may or may not
continue this, depending on how I feel and if I get
some good ideas for further episodes. I am planning to
move two chapters of &quot;Blood&quot; over to this fic later,
as well as possibly tying in other fics to this
series, we&#39;ll see.</pre>
