<p>“Bibliopolis,  Part One: the city of knowledge.”</p>
<p>Hmm…light  skin, no  blemishes, cheery face, small round nose, deep brown eyes, high cheek  bones, and lips that almost seem to pout in their near-fullness. A  petite body, small breasts, long and delicate fingers—perfect for  working the innards of crafts and transports—and very short hair,  kept functional and unobtrusive. Shana made sure to get Herut’s  permission before drawing her portrait, and since she promised she’d  be very quiet and wouldn’t be in the way, Herut saw no reason to  deny her this tiny pleasure. The smallish maintenance and  repair unit was just now starting to understand the heart and soul of  an artist—she expressed herself in writing when she had the free  time—and so she knew why Shana had the desire to create.</p>
<p>Later,  Eve wandered  by, cast her eyes to look at Shana, and settled in to assist Herut.  Artificially-created humans like her were usually better at their  jobs than their creators, but sometimes, rarely, somebody came along  that exceeded their talents. Instead of feeling jealous,  though, Herut considered Eve an invaluable asset and relied on her  experience to guide her, even though their fields of expertise were  different.</p>
<p>“I’m not  interrupting, am I?” she asked the artist. Shana smiled  sweetly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m almost  done. Want me to draw you?”</p>
<p>“Bah, no thanks. I appreciate the offer, though.” Shana giggled quietly to  herself and concluded her little masterpiece. A lot of people  onboard had a uniform opinion of Eve—that she was a snappy, biting,  sarcastic, misanthropic loner who was too absorbed in her celebrity  to associate with the human race—but she seemed pretty nice to  Shana, and she definitely treated Herut like a friend. True,  being elbow-deep in her environment soothed her nerves and gave her  purpose and challenge, but Shana felt that as long as people were  nice to Eve, she would return the favor.</p>
<p>“You’ve got  talent,” she admitted as she saw the portrait. She had  portrayed Herut well but had also included her own personal, loving  touch. Shana already admired the young woman and more than  likely decided to draw her in order to get close. It wasn’t  particularly difficult making friends with Herut in spite of her  obsessive work ethic: one merely had to be virtuous, patient,  and fully in control of their emotions—in other words, the exact  opposite of Chandra. But studying Herut and Eve also led Shana  to study their work, and in no time at all, her puzzle-solving  capabilities were flaring up.</p>
<p>“What are you  doing?”</p>
<p>“Just looking  around,” Eve said. Herut could tell her new friend wanted  more information than that, and expanded.</p>
<p>“Well, the <em>Dauntless</em> is in peak condition; we’re really just seeing how it works. I’m unfamiliar with most of this technology, though, so our studies  have been very slow.”</p>
<p>“Can I look?” Herut scooted over and Eve’s face darkened. Shana was  harmless, though; her smile glowed and brought a fresh color to  Kasberry’s cheeks. One of the panels had been opened to  expose the circuitry, but as Herut said, it was unlike anything  previously seen. It looked more like a cellular structure than  wires or tubes, and it pulsed, radiated, and even moved with a  strange life.</p>
<p>“Eve and I  theorize that these cells receive electric signals unconsciously  emitted by the brain. Do you know how emotions and reactions  are made? By chemical responses or imbalances, and electric  waves. These cells pick this up and react in kind, which  explains how </p>
<p>the  surrounding area always seems to know what it is you want to see. When  I look, I see circuitry and gears functioning perfectly; when  Eve looks…” She looked at her mentor, expecting an answer. Kasberry  shrugged and mumbled humbly.</p>
<p>“Uh, robots, I  guess.” <em>But  that’s not what I </em><em><u>really</u></em><em> want.</em> Herut smiled.</p>
<p>“We can really  make it anything we want, though. Have you visited Kyrie yet,  or the Acheron sisters? They’re experiencing very unusual  phenomenon as well.”</p>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<p>“Kay and Tee said  it only took them five seconds to learn the controls, even though  this ship is so alien,” Eve gestured. “And I overheard  Kyrie yelling something about how this ship’s energy is practically  self-perpetuating.”</p>
<p>“Factor in the  accommodations we’ve all been given, which somehow mold themselves  to the individual needs of the crew, and we have on our hands the  perfect vessel.” Shana rubbed her eyes and felt herself go  dizzy. It had taken her this long just to get used to  everything and now she was ready to burst. What made things  even worse was that, when she finally recovered and offered the two  women a tired grin, Mink came by announcing that the <em>Dauntless</em> had reached its ultimate destination.</p>
<p>“You mean we’re  already here?” Herut said, reasonably surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes. The  planet we have been searching for is called Bibliopolis, located in  the outermost rim of the Langfar system, sixth in distance from its  star. We are currently suspended in space at a distance of five  light-minutes, and the Acheron sisters estimate our arrival in one  and a half hours.”</p>
<p>“That was quick!”  Eve exclaimed. She cast a watery grin at her guests and stood  up, supporting all her weight on her left leg. “But I guess  we had to come here sooner or later. What’re our orders,  Mink?”</p>
<p>“Dr. Miracle and  Amy have requested that I instruct everyone to meet in the general  assembly room. They will explain what they need us to do  there.”</p>
<p>“So we’re going  to see that thing again,” Shandra sighed. She wasn’t  exactly terrified of Miracle, but she did fear that mysterious  phantasm, and she was not the only one. Herut was not used to  human interaction, but she felt it was necessary to comfort her new  friend and support her as they joined the rest of the crew.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Everyone could hear  Amy grunting as she hobbled into the room, supported by her crutches  and not her cane. Despite Fuuka’s efforts, the pain in her  right food must’ve been extraordinary—her face was covered in  sweat and she struggled to breathe—and it was only through sheer  force of will that she was able to move about at all. But at  last the <em>Dauntless</em> had arrived at their destination—Bibliopolis, of all places!—and  Dr. Miracle knew it was time for the crew to prove their worth. The  spectral entity revealed itself as a tiny shining ice-crystal  this time, dampening Kyrie’s hopes for a relationship and  suppressing Naja’s urge to challenge them again.</p>
<p>“As you all know  by now,” began the mousy woman, “we have arrived at our  destination, and in less than an hour, we will make port. I  apologize for not revealing our goal sooner, but now that we’re  here, all your questions may be answered. Doctor, they are  yours.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“<em>Bibliopolis is  the planet of knowledge,”</em> whispered the entity—a far cry from its megalomaniacal booming. <em>“As  the name entails, it is ‘a city of books’, where researchers can  study any material or subject. There are no academies and very  few living spaces; every surface has been devoted to libraries. You can  therefore deduce that I have been after a book all this time,  but I assure you, my dear ladies, this is no ordinary manuscript. Its  value is so inestimable that only a select group of elitists are  even permitted to glimpse at it. Most citizens are allowed to  roam free and research at will, but there are some areas sanctioned  off from the main populace, and the book I am searching for has the  highest priority security possible. Your goal is to  successfully bring this book to me, using any means necessary.”</em></p>
<p>“All right!”  Naja giggled. “I knew you had a few redeemable qualities! So I don’t have to hold back, do I?”</p>
<p>“<em>No,”</em> Miracle answered, <em>“the  patrol is monitored by robot guards, much like the ones Eve Kasberry  is familiar with.”</em> The crew glanced at her; she turned red from so much attention.</p>
<p>“You must mean the  Executioner-class battle androids. This must be a hot item if  machines of that caliber are protecting it.”</p>
<p>“<em>Yes.  Because this fortress has such impressive defenses, my assistant and  I have divided everyone into smaller groups based on your skills. We  have selected leaders from each of these groups to assemble a  team, mixing two crewmembers from each group to optimize a balanced  party, and guide this team to the book. Amy and I strongly urge  each of you to cooperate: you are NOT going to turn this into a  competition. Everyone will be paid the same amount regardless  of whether they reach the treasure or not.”</em></p>
<p>“What good is  that?” Lil murmured to herself.</p>
<p>“<em>It is the  fairest bargain we could create. Now, we will reveal the teams  we have created. Remember, this is based on your type of skill  and nothing more.”</em> Amy quietly walked over to a covered chalkboard that had been  standing there and removed the sheet covering it. Written in  clear, bold letters was the following:</p>
<p><strong>Offensive  team: Kate, Athena, Sharyn, Allegra, Lil, Naja</strong></p>
<p><strong>Infiltration  team: Alala, Shana, Riene, Chandra, Vimmy, Yenae</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transport  team: K+T, Herut, Eve, Kyrie, Rebecca, Amy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Support: Mink, Fuuka, Aseria, Lyara, Dr. Miracle, Valti</strong></p>
<p>“This  is about  half the crew here,” she explained, then hobbled over to a second  chalkboard and unveiled the names and positions of the second half.  Several people were surprised to see where they were classified, but  after some thought, they understood Miracle’s intentions. “We’ve  narrowed it down to two major areas,” she continued. “As I explained on  the first day, we’ve learned that only females  are allowed to proceed past the initial defenses. The codes  change every year, so next time, only males will be allowed any  further. As it turned out, Miracle calculated that this year  would be our best chance of infiltrating their fortress, and so  that’s why my master only asked for women. Now, I’m going  to announce the leaders and ask that they hand-pick two people from  each group to comprise their team. Bear in mind that only one  member may be taken from the group you as leader are in. As for  support, you have a choice between Mink, Dr. Fujiwara, and Professor  Brignor, since Dr. Miracle has stated that Aseria and Lyara would be  better suited staying here.”</p>
<p>“What?! Now  that really isn’t fair!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I think I know  why,” Aseria said, staring right into Lillianne’s eyes. She  didn’t calm down but she did listen. “Lyara is telepathic. I am a strategist. We would be of no use on the field. Is  that what Dr. Miracle had in mind?”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” Amy  chuckled. “We need you to direct all three teams to victory  and maintain communications. My master will also remain here to  monitor and direct both teams. Since only Dr. Miracle knows  what we’re truly after, we will have to rely on their judgment. Now for our leaders. Naja Elapidae, you are going to represent  the Offensive.”</p>
<p>“Of course!” she  purred triumphantly, practically radiating with pride. “It’s  the logical choice. You’ve got a discerning eye there, Ames.”</p>
<p>“As for  representative of the Infiltrators, I’ve selected Yenae Marliir for  her experience with outlaws and military forces.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t  have,” she chuckled.</p>
<p>“I will lead the  Transport team,” Amy said, trudging over to join them as they sized  up their potential teammates. “Naja, Yenae, please select two  people from the other teams and one from your own. We’ll flip  a coin to decide who gets first choice; I’ll go last and take  whoever remains. Naja, since your name comes first in the  alphabet, you call it while it’s in the air.” Amy flipped  the coin…</p>
<p>“Tails…” She caught it and announced the victor.</p>
<p>“Naja goes  first.” The snake-woman celebrated her victory; Yenae just  smiled mysteriously. She knew right away that Naja would take  “the best” people available, leaving her with more strategic  choices. Naja carefully weighed all her options and did indeed  seem to favor those who had shown themselves to be exceptional in  their field.</p>
<p>“Athena, you’re  with me. I don’t like you, but you’re probably the toughest  bitch out of everyone here. Shana, Vimmy, you’re with me as  well. I’ll need someone with a good memory who can solve any  problem we come across—and we all know how powerful money is. Eve, Acheron sisters, it’s a no-brainer. Not even my own  people are as good as you. Mink, you’re coming with me. I heard you can do just about anything, and I’d like to see if it’s  true.”</p>
<p>“All right,” she  replied numbly. “It will be nice working with Master Vimmy.”</p>
<p>“And what a  selection, Miss Elapidae, you truly have an eye for quality, why this  team may be the best in all the galaxy, and I’m sure we’ll reach  the treasure first, but are you sure it’s all right to take such  worthy candidates while leaving everyone else behind, I mean, not  that any of YOU are no good, I just mean we’re probably the best,  and what will you do, I wonder, if—“</p>
<p>“All right, that’s  enough!” Yenae barked. Naja sighed and thanked her. Sometimes, even a playful person like Yenae can have their patience  tested. <em>Okay,  deep breath. Time to demonstrate how you work smarter, not  harder.</em> “Kate, I’m definitely taking you. I was really impressed  with how you handled that incident on Sargasso. Allegra, I’m  jonesing for a bronco-busting cowgirl. I’d also like to take  Herut and Kyrie, if I may, and of course, my sweet little  honey-buns.”</p>
<p>“I told you to  stop calling me that!!” Alala screamed. Yenae laughed.</p>
<p>“But it’s such a  cute name! All right, moving on: Fuuka, I’d be honored  to have you. Won’t you join us?” Fuuka said she would  indeed, but wished that Naja hadn’t separated her from Athena. Yenae’s choices might have seemed odd, but there was a subtle  genius behind it that only a few people appreciated. She wanted  to take Herut so she could be separated from Chandra, and even though  she still didn’t trust Kyrie, she knew her inventor’s skills  would be invaluable (how strange that enemies oftentimes make the  best allies, and friends are the worst!). Taking Alala seemed  like a whim until one realized how deeply Yenae respected and </p>
<p>admired  her, and how useful she knew the feisty cat-girl would be. The  others were obvious choices; Naja might have taken Fuuka herself if  the doctor wasn’t so repulsed by her.</p>
<p>“I guess that  means you all will be coming with me,” Amy said to Sharyn, Lil,  Riene, Chandra, Rebecca, and Valti. They all groaned and looked  offended, but it couldn’t be helped. Even a dream team has to  have somebody picked last. “Now don’t look so glum,” she  said, brightening their moods a little with her beaming face. “Just because you’re last, that doesn’t mean you’re not going  to be important. Our chances of reaching the treasure are just  as good as anyone else’s.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it,”  Lil snorted. “You’ll slow us down with that gimpy leg!”</p>
<p>“You don’t need  to worry about me,” Amy replied, her voice strong and crystal  clear. Lil was taken aback for a moment, but regained her  composure and asked what the next move was. After the second  half of the crew got their teams organized, Miracle explained the  next step, bringing up a scale model of the two major strongholds.</p>
<p>“<em>Amy, Naja,  Yenae, you will be entering Gutenberg City; Changera, Kacey, Daryll,  you will be entering Jefferson City. There are three entrances  to each city, so you will have to rely on your respective strategists  to place you accordingly. From there, you are practically on  your own. Even I do not know what sorts of trials you will have  to go through, so remain alert and keep one another informed. One group will certainly come across the treasure, so when you do,  please inform the others and exit the city immediately. Rendezvous at the ship and we will abandon the planet at once; you  will then be paid and your services shall come to an end.”</em></p>
<p>“You make it sound  so easy,” Eve sighed bitterly. “Look, even if we get past  security, how the hell are we supposed to find your stupid book if we  don’t even know what it <em>looks</em> like!?” Miracle answered by showing a visual image of the  treasured manuscript, though in reality, it didn’t look different  from any other book. It was bound in a humble hardback wrapping  and had no discernable traits except for its bluish-green color. Eve snorted and said, “So? That doesn’t tell us anything.”</p>
<p>“<em>It will most  likely be protected by UCM Interceptors. Find them and you’ve  found the book.”</em></p>
<p>“Oh, that makes  things <em>much</em> easier!” she shouted angrily. Shana, who would be on Eve’s,  pulled her arm.</p>
<p>“Is that a bad  thing?”</p>
<p>“Let’s put it  this way, kid,” she groaned: “unless one of us can pull a  positron disruptor out of our asses, or rig an explosion that turns  the whole city into a crater, or if they can rip apart quantum armor,  I’m afraid we are royally screwed.”</p>
<p>“But you’re good  with machines. Couldn’t you program them so they don’t  attack us?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” she  replied uneasily, “but that’s only if they decided to shut down  for a few hours. I mean, I could do it in theory, but they’re  so friggin’ advanced that it’d be quicker just to destroy them. And that won’t happen anytime soon.”</p>
<p>“Not with that  attitude, at any rate,” Valti snickered. Eve snorted and held  up her hand, indicating she was no longer interested in the argument.</p>
<p>“Say what you  will, but I know what I’m talking about.” Naja placed a  steely hand on Eve’s shoulder and squeezed firmly.</p>
<p>“You forget you’ve  got the baddest mother-fucker in the galaxy leading this team! I don’t know about Athena, but they haven’t made a machine yet  that can stand up to Naja!” She laughed out loud, so  confident and vibrant that, even though it was probably all talk, it  still boosted morale. Eve sighed and muttered something about  ignorance being bliss; the rest of the </p>
<p>teams  assembled in their respective transports and waited impatiently for  their destination. Two groups, three teams in each group, and  seven people in each team—plus fifteen crewmembers staying behind  with Dr. Miracle to monitor the progress—with just one goal that  would unite them all…</p>
<p>Or  else spell their doom.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Descending to  Bibliopolis signaled the beginning of the end of their journey. The world flourished beneath the <em>Dauntless</em> as a series of large domes, connected by tunnels and stretches of  road, built to preserve their valuable libraries against the  unusually harsh environment. The truth was that this planet was  almost uninhabitable, so far removed from its star that only the  toughest plants and fungi could scratch out a living here. None  of the higher forms of life thrived in the natural world, except for  a few fish that were accustomed to the cold, dark, dreary land, but  because the atmosphere was breathable and there was an almost  inexhaustible supply of water (like Helios 3, most of Bibliopolis  contained this precious mineral), civilization had begun here. Scholars figured that an isolated, empty world like this would be  perfect for storing the galaxy’s information, and so over the  decades, the city of knowledge sprang up.</p>
<p>“So why is it  called Gutenberg City?” Shana asked as her team drove to their  destination. The ports immediately led to all the tunnels and  sheltered highways that served to connect the domed cities, so the  crew hit the road as soon as they left the ship and passed through  customs. Quick farewells had to be made since the other two  teams zoomed off in different directions, leaving Naja to care for  her recruits.</p>
<p>“Hell if I know,”  mumbled the leader.</p>
<p>“The city was most  likely named after the Gaian inventor of moveable type,” Mink  reported. “According to what I’ve read, all of Helios 3 was  modernized once the written word became available for the masses. It’s a fitting name.”</p>
<p>“Oh.  Say,  can I have some opinions here? This world isn’t exactly  pretty to look at, but I wanted to draw all the places we visited. See,  I already have Trig 4, Strategos, the comet, and Sargasso.” She  revealed her works of art to the team; their reception was  positive but quick, since they all wanted to concentrate on the task  at hand.</p>
<p>“Artists aren’t  limited to beauty alone,” Teleah reminded her. “Picasso  once depicted the city of Guernica under attack. Reuben  portrayed women as they were. Dali and Escher explored the  surreal. You must represent truth as well.”</p>
<p>“And you have to  be consistent,” Kayleigh reminded her quietly. “If you’re  going to draw all the places you visited, you can’t omit one world  just because it doesn’t look nice.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re  right.” She shaded her paper with midnight blue and bleary  green, dotting the sky with sickly clouds and giving the domes an  eerie halogen glow. She had meant to make sketches of all the  crew, but with so many women and so little time, Shana had to abandon  this in order to concentrate on her original goal. And their  journey had just started! It had barely been a week since they  all blasted out of Strategos, and now they had arrived at their  destination. If Shana had known the trip would be so short, she  wouldn’t have signed up, regardless of pay.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The crew could keep  driving to a certain point, but after that, they would be in  restricted territory and would have to rely on their combined  skills. This came sooner than expected: the Acheron  sisters were forced to surrender their rental car when they came to a  thick steel wall, protected by low-level robots and standard security  fare—cameras and keypads, mainly. Nobody made a move for a  long time, so Vimmy decided to vent her selfish frustrations.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this  where we’re supposed to go, because we’ve reached a dead end and  logic entails that our treasure is being heavily protected, so it  must be in a restricted area, and this is where we are now, so why  the delay, don’t you want to get paid, this is what we all came  for, we can’t very well go back, I don’t see what the hold-up—“</p>
<p>“Shut up,” Naja  spat, giving the petite chatterbox a little kick.</p>
<p>“I have to agree,”  Athena said coldly. “If we’re going to get the treasure,  let’s just go. Everyone here has promised total commitment.”</p>
<p>“That’s the  thing,” Eve sighed as she studied the robots. They would be  easy to destroy, but… “Once we cross that line, we’ll be  thieves. I’m pissed off enough as it is, what with the UCM  after my ass, so just think what might happen when we have the most  powerful people in the galaxy after us.”</p>
<p>“Then we’d  better do this right,” Tee said. She and her sister smiled  and nodded as one.</p>
<p>“Dismantle  security and break in. Aseria and Lyara will have to handle the  rest.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I’m  not comfortable putting my investment in the hands of two strange  elves, are you sure we can do this, there’s bound to be dangers  here that even we won’t be able to face, and—MINK, what in blazes  do you think you’re doing, step away from them!!”</p>
<p>“Forgive me,  Vimmy,” she said as she approached the keypad. The sentries  sprang into action and attacked; Athena and Naja leaped into action;  Eve pulled a rifle out and started firing; Shana screamed as she  darted through the chaos and joined Mink. The keypad was so  ridiculously simple to crack that the door was open before the battle  itself ended. But soon everyone was caught up, the Acheron  sisters took back the car, and they were racing through the forbidden  corridors of Bibliopolis in search of the one item that had brought  them all together.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>Dr. Miracle had not  been speaking frivolously when they emphasized the high security of  the forbidden lairs. Kay and Tee were tested almost at once as  spikes and nails poked up from beneath, shredding the car to chunks  as it careened out of control. Guns emerged from hidden  compartments and blared at the intruders; Eve was obliged to  demonstrate her sniper’s skills, and if Allegra had been there, she  would’ve turned blue with envy. Athena even jumped out of the  vehicle and swung her sword, slicing the guns and cameras in half as  the car limped its way across the road. Getting out and walking  was out of the question, but they couldn’t drive like this forever;  they had to find a way to keep moving.</p>
<p>The car died as  several well-timed shots killed the engine. Vimmy was cowering  behind the seats and screaming so quickly that even Mink was unable  to hear what she said. All this time, the gray-skinned woman  sat as calmly as she could, her hands folded and her face betraying  no emotion, save a very faint look of concern. As the car  ground to a halt, carved apart by the spikes, the guns were silenced  and several sentries marched down the road, their feet padded and  their weapons ready.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Eve, I have an  idea!” Shana shouted.</p>
<p>“I’m way ahead  of you,” she replied. “Naja, Athena, hold them off for a  few minutrs! I’m going to try and reprogram one. Maybe  we can ride it across the street.”</p>
<p>“But aren’t  you—“ Their concern was cut off as she jumped out of the  car, darting around the hailstorm, and ducked underneath one of the  guards. How she could run across that razor-sharp floor was a  total mystery, but there were other things to worry about. Naja  jumped into their ranks, ripping off heads and limbs with her bare  hands, leapfrogging from one to another, always a breath away from  the deadly surface. The Acheron sisters took Eve’s forgotten  rifle and fired; Mink protected Vimmy and Shana. One of the  robots suddenly turned on its comrades, blowing them apart and  turning them all to scrap. Eve climbed up to its top, waved  triumphantly, and steered it over to her team.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Shana!”  she said. “And thank you, Naja. I may be the only one  who can actually walk across this floor.”</p>
<p>“How’s  that?”  they wondered. Eve took off her shoes and lifted her  grease-stained pants. Her left leg was completely mechanical,  while her right leg was encased in metal from the knee down. “Oh,”  Shana cooed, “that’s so cool!” The team climbed  up and, with Eve at the helm, they passed across the spike floor.  Occasionally, more teams of robot guards and guns stopped them, and  their “ride” was usually the one that paid the biggest price. But there  was always another fresh recruit for their purpose, and  after about an hour of this wandering and fighting, they came to the  end of the tunnel and were faced with another security door.</p>
<p>“Looks like it’s  my turn again.” While Shana was hacking her way inside, Naja  crossed her arms impatiently. She didn’t mind being a leader,  even for a group of treasure-hunters, but she preferred being in  command of real soldiers in a real battle. Sure this was  exciting, and a good way to pass the time, but she really didn’t  want to be stuck baby-sitting forever. Somehow she had to find  a way to leave her home and her prison, and achieve her dream in  spite of what her family thought. She also had what she called  D-Day on her mind—the day when she removed her old skin and came  out fresh and pink again—and the crushing loneliness that crowds  afforded. What made it worse was that she was the only Elshyrin  onboard, and though she respected a few of the women on the ship,  none of them were up to her demanding standards. Even Kate had  significant shortcomings.</p>
<p>“Done!” Shana  chirped.</p>
<p>“Down!” Athena  shouted. She threw her sword and disabled the Executioner-class  android before it could raise its weapon. Everything happened  so fast that even Vimmy was stunned.</p>
<p>“Oh dear, was that  monstrosity waiting just for us, what a large machine it is, and it  looks like it could wipe us all out, didn’t you say you had one,  Eve, so why not bring it out, but wait, Miracle said there was  something even worse out there, I wonder if Athena’s brilliant  maneuver will save us in—“</p>
<p>“It’s getting  up,” Mink warned her—and sure enough, the android was rising to  its feet, Athena’s sword still embedded in its faceplate. Eve  demanded her rifle back and took aim, but she couldn’t get a clean  shot since the machine was already on the move.</p>
<p>“Naja, keep it  pinned down! Athena, cut an opening in its rear!”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m the  leader of this outfit, and I’m the one who gives the orders!”</p>
<p>“Okay, but unless  you know their weakness, you’d better listen!” Naja roared  in irritation and squeezed the droid’s legs shut, rendering it  temporarily immobile.</p>
<p>“Hurry,  bunny-bitch!” she screamed. “This thing’s stronger than  it looks.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Right.” Athena yanked Murisato out of the machine with blinding speed,  vaulted over its shoulders, a whisker away from being perforated, and  leaped down its back, swinging twice to open up its rear. Eve  fired and blew a big hole in the exposed circuitry; the assassin fell  to its knees and was silenced, giving everyone time to breathe.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Naja,”  Eve murmured. “I couldn’t have done it without you. And Athena, I owe you as well.”</p>
<p>“Forget about it,”  she said emptily. Naja just turned her head when Eve thanked  her.</p>
<p>“Don’t get the  wrong idea, human! The only reason I did what you told me was  because I wanted to kill that thing as quickly as possible. And  let me remind you that <em>I</em> was the one who chose you, precisely because I knew you’d come in  handy! So as far as I’m concerned, you’re doing exactly  what I want you to.”</p>
<p>“You’re  welcome,” Eve muttered. Shana walked up to her and smiled  cutely.</p>
<p>“You were really  cool back then. I’m glad you’re on this team! I just  wish I could do a bit more.”</p>
<p>“Uh, sure.” Eve scratched her neck and walked away, feeling awkward. Shana  wasn’t disappointed, though: she knew Eve could open up to  others once she was properly motivated. She just had to keep  being nice to her, that’s all…</p>
<p>The trials were  ceaseless. Shana took longer and longer to crack the codes, and  the opposition grew tougher and tougher. Regrettably, Eve had  been unable to bring her assassin droid with her, so they could only  rely on their own skills. Vimmy complained about all the  walking they were forced into, and Naja always chewed her out,  reminding her how annoying and cowardly she was.</p>
<p>“You Norgrim sure  are a big pain in the ass!” she spat. “If I had known it’d  be this bad, I would’ve left you behind!”</p>
<p>“First of all,  please don’t use my species’ name, or else you’ll be sued for  all your worth, and secondly, may I remind you that you chose me for  a specific purpose and—“</p>
<p>“And we haven’t  run into anything in this city except machines, so what good will  that checkbook of yours do us? Sheesh, I don’t have perfect  foresight, you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m a  businesswoman and an entrepreneur, my good Elshyrin, not a warrior, I  use my wits and my influence to fight all my battles, and let you  other folks handle the combat, oh, what a brutish thing it is t—“</p>
<p>“Okay, we get it. I’m sorry I forced you along!” Her sarcasm was venomous; it  could’ve easily replaced the poison in her fangs, which were bared  and nearly ready to strike. But Naja wouldn’t waste her  toxins on Vimmy, not while there was still some potential use for  her. If she played her cards right, in fact, Vimmy could prove  to be her most valuable ally, provided she stopped talking long  enough.</p>
<p>“We should be  quiet,” Kay said suddenly.</p>
<p>“I heard someone!”  her sister exclaimed. Naja groaned.</p>
<p>“Oh great, another  robot. Maybe we can bribe this one.”</p>
<p>“Who’s  there?” She raised her eyebrows in surprise as she heard a human voice.  Three men were marching down the hallway, most likely a maintenance  crew to keep the robots in good health, and flashed their lights and  the guns at the seven travelers. One blew a whistle: “Intruder alert!  Get down on the ground and put your hands on  your head!”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ah, gentlemen!”  Vimmy exclaimed, welcoming them with open arms. “What  marvelous timing, do you know who you’ve run into, we’re the  Nurogrim envoy—all rights reserved—here on special permission by  His Supremacy, Vicegerent Dissha, given a once in a lifetime peek at  that magnificent tome you have locked up, you know the one, the  Vicegerent is very generous, don’t you agree, letting us see a  treasure exclusively for his eyes only?!”</p>
<p>“Uhh…” The guards paused to process this information—and so did the  others. Except for Mink, nobody knew what Vimmy was talking  about at all, but they were sure it was a ploy of hers. She was  trying desperately to show her talents, but whether or not it worked  remained to be seen.</p>
<p>“Let’s see some  ID,” they barked. Vimmy happily complied and ordered Mink to  show them “the document”. She pulled a scroll from her purse and  handed it to Mink, who presented it to the guards. The team was  worried for a moment that Vimmy’s ruse would fall apart, but the  expressions on the patrol’s face was enough to convince them that  somehow, it had all worked out.</p>
<p>“It’s  the genuine article,” they concluded: “signed and sealed by  Vicegerent Dissha himself. Please excuse us for any trouble we may  have caused you—we just didn’t think…”</p>
<p>“Yes,  yes, I know, it’s perfectly all right, how were you to know, what  with this being a private matter, now could you please escort us to  the manuscript, and here’s some money for your troubles, don’t  refuse it on my account, you’ve all done a great job, keep it up!” She handed them all a thick wad of bills, enough to clear any  further doubts they might have had. The little purple businesswoman  then cast a glance at Naja, grinned, and winked proudly.</p>
<p>“I’ll  be damned,” she whispered in amazement. “That goblin’s more  useful than I thought. But of course, right!? I mean, I did put her  in my team!” The Acheron sisters were too curious to wait; they  approached Vimmy and pulled her aside so the guards wouldn’t hear.</p>
<p>“How  did you manage to pull that off? Is that document real? Do you  honestly know this Dissha person?”</p>
<p>“We  all have secrets, yes, so just trust in your dear friend Vimmy and  all will be well, see, and I told you violence never solves anything,  you ought to give diplomacy a chance now and then, eh, and of course,  nothing wrong with waving your gold around, but oh, these guards are  quick, say Mink, dear, will you please carry me, my feet are killing  me!”</p>
<p>“Okay.” And so, thanks to Vimmy’s craftiness—whether or not that  document was real seemed irrelevant now—they were given free reign  of the prohibited areas, without a single obstacle to get in their  way.</p>
