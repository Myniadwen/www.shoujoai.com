<a href="../original/angelgift-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>The slip-transit effect shimmered in the air, then the
group of people materialized in the large bay. The
tall, almost rake thin woman looked around as her
security and engineering squad spread out, then
activated a wrist mounted communicator. &quot;We&#39;re
aboard,&quot; Chief Engineer Lucas Anais, &quot;there&#39;s standard
atmosphere, but remaining power levels are low.&quot;

Captain Allison Tennison replied, &quot;Any sign of crew?&quot;

Amara looked around cautiously, the black haired woman
holding a pistol in the ready position. &quot;Fan out with
the engineers,&quot; she said to Roma and Sharin as the
conversation continued behind them, &quot;in case there are
any Star Empire troops aboard.&quot;

&quot;We haven&#39;t really started exploring yet,&quot; Lucas
replied to her captain gently, &quot;but I&#39;ll notify you
when we do.&quot;

There was the sound of a puffed out breath. &quot;Then
carry on at your own discretion,&quot; Allison said, &quot;and
be careful.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Lucas agreed before the captain signed off.
&#39;She&#39;s probably like to be over here too,&#39; she
thought, &#39;but the Commander wouldn&#39;t allow it.&#39;

The lights around them were dim, with only emergency
systems still operating after the powerful
electromagnetic pulse had hit the sentinel station.
Any normal celestial event, the place&#39;s shields and
armor could deflect and withstand, but the artificial
pulse had been many times more powerful than anything
they had been designed to take.

&quot;I&#39;m still not quite sure why I&#39;m here with the
security squad,&quot; Sharin commented, the blonde haired
woman looking around calmly.

Amara smiled grimly, &quot;Your powers as a Questor,
mostly. With how short on crew we are, I&#39;d rather have
you here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m touched,&quot; Sharin smiled wryly.

Lieutenant Sam C&#39;tarn smiled slightly, his nearly bald
head gleaming and beard sprinkled with gray. &quot;So
what&#39;s the plan, Chief?&quot; he asked.

Lucas smiled back at him, &quot;Not much of one, I&#39;m
afraid. Roma and I will head to the power core to
reboot the system, you, Sharin, Michelle and Amara
head to the command center, we&#39;ll need the internal
scanners to determine station&#39;s status.&quot;

Michelle Allen nodded thoughtfully, her long rose
tinted hair falling down her back gracefully. &quot;You
should be able to restart the fusion core,&quot; she
frowned, &quot;but why didn&#39;t we just directly slip-transit
there?&quot;

&quot;Too much internal armor,&quot; Lucas said crisply, &quot;Alex
couldn&#39;t be certain we wouldn&#39;t transit right into a
solid object.&quot;

Sam visibly paled as he murmured, &quot;Say no more.&quot; The
effects of slip-transiting into a solid object were
commonly known, though very few witnessed the
phenomenon and lived. Much like matter and antimatter
the two objects would be almost instantly converted to
pure energy, generating a massive explosion.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Michelle said to them firmly,
&quot;there&#39;s only so long the air will stay breathable in
here without power.&quot;

Together the two groups hurried to the emergency
conduits, using the ladders there to either climb or
descend to the correct levels. &quot;I can&#39;t believe we
have to do this in this era,&quot; Amara grumbled, a bit of
sweat soon staining her uniform.

&quot;Could be worse,&quot; Michelle commented, pulling herself
up forcefully.

&quot;Oh?&quot; Sharin growled.

&quot;We&#39;re not under full ships gravity because of the
shut down,&quot; Sam puffed as he dragged himself forward,
&quot;it&#39;d be worse with power active.&quot;

&quot;A good point,&quot; Amara conceded. She frowned as she
looked up the circular tube they climbed in, one
nearly as wide as she was tall and asked, &quot;Are the
security systems active under emergency power?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Michelle replied, &quot;the security grid is
considered a lower priority, especially with life
support systems on low.&quot;

&quot;Thank gods,&quot; Sharin replied honestly. There was a
hatch just ahead of them set into the wall, the
numerals beside it indicating the floor and section.
&quot;I think we&#39;re near the command center?&quot;

&quot;Yup,&quot; Sam calmly grabbed the handle and turned, a
soft squeaking following the hatch shifting up to
reveal a dim corridor beyond.

&quot;Me first,&quot; Amara gestured the others as she entered
into the hallway, pistols drawn as she scanned around
her warily. Once she was sure the coast was clear she
waved the other out, the group heading up the hall.

Michelle had the schematics on her portable, scrolling
through the files as they walked. &quot;The command center
should be just ahead,&quot; she said, &quot;and there&#39;s an
emergency shelter nearby, too.&quot;

&quot;We can check that once we finish with the command
center,&quot; Sam replied firmly. He smiled slightly, &quot;And
knowing Lucas we should have main power up soon, too.&quot;

Down in engineering Lucas smiled slightly, her head
buried in an open console even as Roma held a
light-unit up to help her see. &quot;The fusion-core&#39;s
containment fields are degrading,&quot; Roma noted calmly,
&quot;they will fail in less than two minutes.&quot;

&quot;Plenty of time,&quot; Lucas answered, bodily ripping a
segment of wiring out and attacking the circuitry with
her plasma-arc. A little over a minute later she
activated the system, smiling broadly as the power
levels of the containment field crept up again.

&quot;I&#39;m impressed,&quot; Roma conceded, the silver skinned
android plugging into a console nearby to monitor the
station&#39;s systems.

Lucas just shrugged, moving over to the main console
and typing away. &quot;Comes with the job,&quot; she answered,
swiftly running through the protocols to bring power
back up in the station. In moments lights went from
dim to their normal intensity, even as the gentle
gravity increased to the planetary standard.

&quot;Sam,&quot; Lucas activated her communicator, &quot;you&#39;ve got
power, start bringing main systems and internal
scanners on line.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Sam answered, &quot;and we&#39;ll start looking
for the crew, too.&quot;

Lucas switched over to command frequencies and hailed
the Liberty&#39;s Sword. &quot;Captain, main power has been
restored,&quot; she reported.

&quot;Well done,&quot; Allison replied warmly, &quot;carry on at your
own discretion.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lucas nodded, feeling pleasantly
surprised that the Captain wasn&#39;t trying to joggle her
elbow. &#39;Then again the Commander is there to keep her
in line,&#39; Lucas noted. &quot;We&#39;ll report in as soon as
anything new develops,&quot; she said.

&quot;Any idea of the extent of damage to the station?&quot;
Allison asked.

&quot;No major structural damage yet,&quot; Lucas answered
cautiously, &quot;but the circuitry I saw was a mess, fused
connections and melted segments.&quot;

&quot;Finding the crew would be our top priority,&quot; Allison
said firmly, &quot;they can then tell us how much
assistance we need.&quot;

&quot;On it,&quot; Lucas nodded, &quot;I have a team in the command
center working on getting internal sensors on as we
speak.&quot;

Allison chuckled, &quot;I&#39;ll leave you to your work, then.&quot;

Lucas signed off, then looked over to Roma. &quot;How are
the internal systems?&quot; she asked her curiously, noting
the distant look in her eyes.

&quot;Most station systems are registering some damage,&quot;
Roma calmly noted as she withdrew her consciousness
from the system, the connection cable returning to her
wrist, &quot;I&#39;ve tried to reroute around any damaged
systems, however.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s head to the bridge,&quot; Lucas said as they
walked out of the power room, heading down the hallway
to the emergency hatch..

&quot;Thankfully the lifts should all be operating,&quot; Roma
pointed out, almost sounding relieved.

They stepped into the empty tube, a soft glow
surrounding them as they were whisked up gently but
quickly. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Lucas smiled, &quot;I forgot.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a talent I lack,&quot; Roma conceded.

They reached the command center level only to blink in
surprise, seeing the floor covered with people milling
about. &quot;Guess Sam found the crew,&quot; she remarked wryly.
