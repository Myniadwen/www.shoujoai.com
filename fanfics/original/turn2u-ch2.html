MJ Dilemma

Dean sat up next to the Strathaven monument, overlooking the entire town 
watching as the day slowly turned to night. His search for answers had 
prove fruitless and he only hoped that he could find out what was 
happening before his friend ended up in even more trouble.

Just then a familiar pain shot into the back of his head, like something 
was trying to push its way out from the inside. He had grown accustomed 
to the feeling as it only meant one thing.

&#147;How&#146;s things Oracle&#148;

Standing off to Dean&#146;s left was a tall rather attractive woman wearing a 
white kimono and with ivory hair that hung down to the small of her 
back. Her eyes were silver and seemed to glow in the dim light and her 
skin a ghostly white. There seemed to be a faint glow radiating from her 
body and her face was an emotionless mask.

&#147;Psychic, I see that you can sense the troubles that will befall our 
young Wolf&#148;

Dean frowned and nodded slightly, not looking at the glowing woman.

&#147;I too have foreseen this and have come to give you some of the answers 
that you seek&#148;

Dean kept his sight firmly fixed on the hill in the distance where he 
sensed his friend&#146;s presence from. &#147;Why are you telling me and not 
Stephanie?&#148; With that he finally turned to face the woman.

Her gaze turned to the place where she sensed the wolf demon and her 
gaze softened.

&#147;She has faced much heartache and pain both physical and mental in the 
past few year, now is a time of happiness for her; I do not wish to 
destroy that happiness&#148;

Dean returned his gaze to the direction of his friend.

&#147;So, you do have a heart after all. So what is it that&#146;s going to 
happen?&#148;

&#147;She&#133;will die&#148; her voice was quiet as she said it, barely above a 
whisper but Dean heard her loud enough.

&#147;Die!!!&#148; he yelled at her as he leaped to his feet, spinning to face her 
&#147;What do you mean die, she&#146;s immortal like you and me&#133;she cant die!&#148;

&#147;Who are you trying to convince Psychic me or yourself&#148; she turned to 
look Dean in the eye and saw the blind horror there, mixed with a 
feeling that she couldn&#146;t understand herself and she knew that both were 
reflected in her own eyes. &#147;She will die&#133;to protect those who are close 
to her, but&#133;&#148;

Dean&#146;s face grew hopeful &#147;But there&#146;s a way to prevent it right. Right.&#148;

Oracle looked to the ground, no longer wanting to look the boy demon in 
the eyes &#147;But I do not know when it will happen, it is too clouded even 
for me to see. I am sorry Dean, truly I am&#148; with that she slowly 
dissipated into a mist and finally disappeared all together only her 
voice lingering on the breeze &#147;I&#146;m sorry&#148;

Dean dropped to his knees, he couldn&#146;t believe it. He turned his head 
slowly to look in the direction his friend was in. Stephanie was going 
to die, and there was nothing he could do to stop it.

********** 

Meanwhile, back on the hill where Stephanie and Madison lay. The two 
young women lay staring up at the starry sky; Madison laid her head 
peacefully on Stephanie&#146;s shoulder and with the demon girl&#146;s arm around 
her.

To Stephanie it couldn&#146;t get any better; here she was, lying on top of a 
hill watching the star filled sky with the woman she loves in her arms. 
It was blissfully perfect.

&#147;Stephanie&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yes MJ&#148;

&#147;Could I&#133;um&#133;stay over at your place tonight&#148;

A slight blush crossed the demon girl&#146;s cheeks and Madison noticed this 
so she gave her friend a reassuring squeeze and smiled at her fondly.

Stephanie couldn&#146;t help but smile back, her blush quickly dissipating.

&#147;Sure MJ, why not&#148; her voice was still a tad nervous as she spoke but as 
Madison&#146;s smile widened she soon felt very reassured.

&#147;Thanks Steph&#148;

********** 

&#147;What!?!&#148; Tina couldn&#146;t believe what she was hearing from Dean and she 
nearly dropped the phone there and then &#147;She can&#146;t die, she&#146;s immortal&#148; 
the statement lacked the confidence that her voice usually carried. She 
tried to calm herself as Dean explained once again what Oracle had told 
him only moments before, and explained why they couldn&#146;t tell Stephanie 
or Madison about it. It would hurt and scare them too much to know that 
the wolf girl would die, he didn&#146;t want anyone in Stephanie&#146;s family to 
know either just incase they let it slip, or couldn&#146;t handle it.

&#147;Alright Dean&#133;&#148; she agreed hesitantly although more calmly to what her 
young friend was asking her to do, she hated keeping secrets from those 
close to her. She heard Dean hang up and she just dropped the phone, her 
hands shaking as she walked over to the window of her apartment.

&#147;Please Dean; find a way to save her&#148;

Tears had begun to force their way into her eyes but she thought them 
back, she wouldn&#146;t cry. She needed to be strong, for Stephanie&#146;s sake.

********** 

Stephanie and Madison walked quietly into the young demons small home, 
this was the first time she had allowed anyone other than herself into 
her house. It was for fear that they&#146;d see her true self mirrored in the 
emptiness of the building. See the true pain and emptiness that was in 
her soul, but now that emptiness was gone. She had Madison now and she 
had finally filled out that void.

All of the walls were of a faded cream brown colour and the ceiling 
grey-white in the darkness. The carpet wasn&#146;t the most comfortable to 
walk on and matched the walls in colour.

The living room to the left of them only had a dark brown couch and 
chair with a little coffee table in the centre of the room. No 
television as Stephanie hated watching her kind on the news or hearing 
more stories about how demons have attacked humans or how anti-demon 
groups have been fighting demon, no not fighting, bullying young demons 
that barely knew what had happened to them.

But none of that was in her mind now; the only thing she was thinking of 
was the girl that was hugging onto her arm so tightly yet so gently. 
Sometimes Stephanie found it hard to believe that Madison was still only 
human; she seemed so, so&#133;

&#147;Angelic&#133;&#148; she whispered to herself quietly as she gazed at her one true 
love with deep caring hazel eyes, that were soon met by majestic blue 
with those tiny hints of green which just added to the angelic look of 
her beautiful face. Then she smiled and Stephanie swore that if her 
heart could beat then it would have just burst right out of her chest 
there and then.

&#147;Can we go upstairs?&#148;

Stephanie blushed again but smiled through it, a sweet happy smile that 
for once wasn&#146;t a mask to hide how she was really feeling on the inside 
this time her smile was genuine and she replied with a simple and quiet 
&#147;sure&#148;.

Stephanie&#146;s house wasn&#146;t exactly big with only a living room and small 
kitchen on the bottom floor and with a small bedroom and bathroom on the 
upper floor. There was also a larger room but it remained empty, she was 
planning on turning it into a small dojo later if anything to work out 
her stress.

Like the ground floor, upstairs shared the same d&eacute;cor. The bathroom with 
just a toilet, sink and a bath with a shower was probably the brightest 
of the rooms. Clean and white, completely unlike Stephanie&#146;s 
personality. She always said she hated white, but the bathroom was a 
contradiction to it.

Her room was small and simple, just to the left of the door was a plain 
bed with navy blue covers, the walls painted with a light blue and the 
carpet the same colour as the covers and curtains on the small window. 
To the right in the far corner of the room was her simple wooden 
computer desk. A few bits of paper sprawled over it of drawings she had 
made to pass the time, the computer wasn&#146;t exactly expensive or high 
tech but it suited her purpose perfectly as it let her access the stuff 
she needed on demons, and her glasses also lay on the desk, she didn&#146;t 
need them because her demon form had cured her of her short-sightedness 
(she was sure if that was even a word) but wearing them while she worked 
on the computer made her feel more, well more human.

The screen saver was probably the only thing that seemed cheerful; it 
was a picture of her and her friends at the beach. Stephanie sat at the 
front of the group her legs crossed on the sand; a rather large grin on 
her face which showed her fangs at the corners of her mouth to show that 
it was actually a time that she felt happy, as could be seen in her 
hazel eyes. Along with her was Tina to her right and Sami to her left. 
Madison and Rhiannon kneeled behind them along with Corey and Nicole. 
Dean, Stuart and Alex stood behind them all with Dean in-between the two 
taller boys. All of them looked so happy, so care free. It was a picture 
from Stephanie&#146;s 18th. It was a day for celebration, a day away from 
searching for ways to reverse everything and away from demon haters and 
the media. It was truly a day for happiness.

*Just like today* Stephanie thought as she looked from the screensaver 
to her one true love still hugging her arm and smiling up at her. 
Nothing could make the day any better.

&#147;Looks like you only have one bed Steph&#148; said Madison as she lets go of 
Stephanie and sat quite comfortably on the edge of the bed.

Stephanie had only just realized it herself; she never had anyone stay 
over so she only had use for one bed. Well Madison deserved the more 
comfortable option than sleeping on the couch.

&#147;Well&#133;um, you&#146;re the guest so you can have the bed&#133;I&#146;ll just sleep on 
the couch&#148;

But before Stephanie could leave Madison stopped her &#147;Oh no you don&#146;t 
Miss Lee, you&#146;re staying right here with me&#148;

At just the thought of sleeping in the same bed as Madison, Stephanie 
turned the brightest shade of red she had ever been and she turned to 
look at Madison, her mouth already open to say her excuse. But has hazel 
brown met perfect blue, Stephanie&#146;s argument died on her lips and her 
blush turned from a bright red to a pale pink across her cheeks. She 
stood their, frozen on the spot as she gazed into Madison&#146;s gorgeous 
eyes, even her tail had stop moving.

&#147;So what do you say Steph, are you going to stay&#148; she asked so 
innocently that Stephanie could only nod as Madison took her hands 
gently and led her gently to the bed beside her, never once breaking eye 
contact with the demon girl.

Then, slowly, she leaned forward, her eyes now closed. Stephanie wasn&#146;t 
aware of anything happening until she finally felt it. Madison&#146;s lips 
pressed gently but firmly to her own and then the blush returned ten 
fold. But soon, the feeling of embarrassment faded as she grew more 
accustomed to the contact, and slowly her eyes closed, and her demon 
senses came into play. Madison&#146;s sweet scent filled her nostrils as did 
the girl&#146;s excitement and the heat from the other girl&#146;s tantalized 
Stephanie&#146;s skin as she returned the kiss and every ounce of fear, 
anxiety and tension that had been pent up in her body since the 
transformation just drained away, electricity jumping between the two 
and for a few brief moments they were in their own personal paradise, 
and for a brief moment Stephanie thought that she had died and gone to 
heaven it felt so good, so right. Then ever so slowly the two separated, 
eyes gradually opening but Stephanie&#146;s remained half lidded, their faces 
flushed.

All Stephanie could do was mouth the word &#147;wow&#148; as Madison smiled back 
to her and whispered quietly.

&#147;The first kiss is the best kiss&#148;

Stephanie&#146;s hand then slowly drifted to her lips, she could still taste 
and feel Madison. Her head felt so light, she had never felt like this 
before. But soon a familiar scent drifted up to her nose, the scent of 
her own excitement, shortly followed by the heat between her legs. She 
closed her eyes tightly trying to fight the feelings that were 
threatening to overtake her, she couldn&#146;t ruin this perfect moment now.

Just then she was jutted from of her thoughts by a gentle warmth 
caressing her cheek and her eyes slowly opened as she looked up at 
Madison.

The other girl was caressing Stephanie&#146;s cheek gently with her hand 
while smiling lovingly at her, a contented sparkle in her eyes, and all 
Stephanie could do was close her eyes and relax into Madison&#146;s touch 
with a content smile and a sigh as her entire body relaxed from just the 
touch of the hand to her cheek.

&#147;Madison&#133;&#148; she whispered quietly.

&#147;Yes Stephanie&#148;

The demon girl&#146;s eyes opened slightly as she smiled contently. &#147;Thank 
you&#148;

Just then a glint of mischief flashed in Madison&#146;s blue eyes but 
Stephanie was still too caught up in the beauty of the moment to even 
notice, not until Madison&#146;s lips touched her&#146;s again did she awake from 
her dreamlike state.

This time though she closed her eyes and started to return the kiss 
instantly. Then a soft, warm and wet tongue rubbed gently at her lips 
and of their on accord they opened slightly inviting the probing 
appendage in.

Stephanie&#146;s eyes shot open in surprise and the pink of her cheeks 
intensified slightly the instant Madison&#146;s tongue touched her own, but 
her eyes soon closed again and she met Madison tongue with her own 
eliciting a slight moan from her love, shortly followed by one of her 
own as her demon senses picked up the combined scents of their 
excitement.

Stephanie couldn&#146;t take it anymore as all of the passion and longing 
that she had kept locked in her soul seemed to well up to the surface. 
She placed her hands on Madison&#146;s shoulders and gently leaned into her, 
pushing her onto her back. She then reluctantly broke the kiss and 
looked down into the blue sparkling eyes of her love.

Madison could see the hunger and longing in Stephanie&#146;s eyes and 
instantly knew what her friend wanted, no, needed at that moment. She 
smiled kindly up to her friend and nodded her approval.

Stephanie smiled weakly but hesitated; Madison noticed this and lifted a 
hand to the young demon&#146;s cheek. Her loving smile constantly on her face 
as she whispered:

&#147;Don&#146;t worry Steph&#133;I&#146;ve been wanting this moment to come just as much as 
you&#148;

That gave Stephanie the strength she needed as she leaned down and this 
time started the kiss herself. Madison closed her eyes and wrapped her 
arms around her lover returning the kiss with all the strength she could 
muster.

Then Stephanie moved from her friend&#146;s lips to her neck, kissing and 
nibbling at the soft flesh gently, her eyes closed to allow her much 
more heightened senses to work better. She could almost swear that her 
heart had started to beat again when she heard Madison moan under her.

Soon, as she grew more confident, her hands started to explore her 
lover&#146;s body more thoroughly. She gently slipped both hands up under her 
shirt, over her smooth abdomen caressing the skin as she went, then 
meeting and sliding under the fabric of Madison&#146;s bra. She gasped 
slightly then let out a long moan of pleasure as soft hands began to 
massage her breasts and tweak her nipples, a warm, wet mouth playing 
with her neck.

&#147;I&#133;I think ohhh&#133;I think that&#133;our clothes&#133;mmm are&#133;&#148;

&#147;Getting in the way&#148; smiled Stephanie as she stopped her loving torture 
of Madison&#146;s breasts and neck &#147;but that can be easily dealt with&#148;.

The two smiled lovingly at each other then shared a quick kiss before 
shedding their clothes into a pile next to the bed and soon they were 
both only in their underwear, and as their eyes locked again Madison was 
surprised to see that Stephanie wasn&#146;t blushing and that her eyes 
carried a playful glint that she was finding increasingly exciting.

Her blue eyes took in her lover&#146;s body and was quite pleased to find 
that Stephanie didn&#146;t wear a bra, *probably too feminine* she thought 
idly as she continued to admire the demon girls body. Her deep hazel 
eyes with little hints of yellow that were so&#133;animal, her slightly 
tanned skin and cute round face framed by soft chestnut brown hair that 
stopped just where her neck began, that single strand of hair that 
always hung down in front of her face which was just so cute, her 
pointed ears that just added to the image of &#147;innocent demon girl&#148; as 
did the chestnut brown tail that wagged excitedly behind her, then she 
smiled, wow what a smile it was just amazing and those cute little fangs 
just added to her innocent look.

&#147;Now&#148; Stephanie&#146;s voice shook Madison from her thoughts &#147;Where were we&#148;

With that she crawled over to Madison, gently pushing her back onto her 
back, smiling all the time. Madison blushed slightly and she started to 
breathe heavily as their eyes locked again, she looked like an animal on 
the prowl.

Then she leaned and kissed Madison&#146;s throat slightly, then gently and 
slowly began to kiss her way down in a torturous descent for Madison.

Stephanie&#146;s lips seemed to burn a path into her skin and she closed her 
eyes and held her breath in anticipation as she felt her lover near her 
target. Then she gasped as soft lips encircled her left nipple and began 
to suckle gently, and began to moan in pleasure as Stephanie&#146;s wet 
tongue began to play with the hardening nub.

Stephanie&#146;s left hand then slid its way up Madison&#146;s side while her 
other arm snaked behind her lover and encircled her waist, holding her 
tightly against her as she continued to lovingly torture Madison&#146;s left 
breast, then smiled into herself as Madison let out a long moan of 
pleasure as her hand found its target and began to message her lover&#146;s 
other breast.

For a brief moment Madison wondered if Stephanie had done anything like 
this before but soon threw the thought away and just let herself be 
devoured by the young demon whose hand had left her breast and began a 
slow descent further.

She nearly screamed as she felt the soft hand slip into her underwear 
and cup her groin before beginning squeeze every so gently. Then as 
Stephanie began to rub in a circular motion her mind nearly exploded, 
she had always hoped for this but&#133;she lost her ability to think straight 
as she felt Stephanie shift and move her body between her lover&#146;s legs 
removing her panties and dropping hem to the floor as she went.

Stephanie closed her eyes and took in the scent of their excitement and 
felt her mouth water, but she wasn&#146;t going to rush in, she wanted the 
moment to last. So she slowly leaned in and placed a soft kiss of 
Madison&#146;s lower lips gaining a gasp of approval from her.

Then, she extended her tongue and ever so lightly ran the tip of it 
slowly up her lover&#146;s labia, and then back again, then smiled as she 
heard Madison begin to speak between gasps and moans, &#147;please&#133;.don&#146;t 
tea..&#148; she couldn&#146;t finish as Stephanie quickly clamped her mouth over 
her lower lips causing her to arch her back and moan rather loudly.

Her tongue continued its sweet torture as her hands slid their way back 
up Madison&#146;s body and cupped her breasts, gently kneading the soft yet 
firm flesh. And soon Madison could no longer make comprehensible speech 
as she moaned, gasped and thrashed uncontrollably.

Stephanie lapped at Madison&#146;s inside walls blissfully while continuing 
her ministrations with her hands, she was happy than she had ever been 
as could be seen by the way her tail wagged about in the air excitedly.

Then, as she pressed her tongue gently to Madison&#146;s clit, she felt her 
lover&#146;s vaginal muscles tighten and heard a loud scream of 
uncontrollable ecstasy fill the air as Madison bucked and orgasmed hard, 
and Stephanie eagerly lapped up the sweet juices that leaked out.

She pushed herself up onto all fours and looked down at the woman she 
loved, a smile on her face as she watched her flushed body pant as she 
finally came back down to earth.

Then she crawled up next to her and lay down, wrapping her arms and tail 
around her and smiling. She kissed Madison gently and smiled into her 
shining blue eyes lovingly.

&#147;Don&#146;t&#133;you&#133;come&#133;up&#133;for&#133;air&#148; panted Madison trying to compose herself.

Stephanie smiled sheepishly as she answered &#147;I don&#146;t breath&#148; her hug 
then tightened slightly around the younger girl &#147;MJ&#133;I love you&#148;

As Madison finally regained her composure, she smiled at the sweet demon 
girl that she could tell from the way she looked at her loved her more 
than life itself. She wrapped her own arms around her lover and kissed 
her gently, a loving smile on her face as she spoke.

&#147;And I&#146;m always gonna be here for you Steph, cos I love you too&#148;

She then leaned in close so she could whisper directly into her lover&#146;s 
ear, both hands slowly drifting round to Stephanie&#146;s front.

&#147;And I want to teach you&#148;

She then gently cupped the demon girl&#146;s breasts eliciting a soft moan 
from her lover.

&#147;How to enjoy your body&#148;

Any thoughts of stopping Madison died on Stephanie&#146;s lips as her lover 
skillfully moved down and took one nipple in her mouth while rolling and 
pinching the other between thumb and forefinger as gently as possible.

The sensations were new to Stephanie; she had never wanted to experiment 
with her body, afraid of being labeled a pervert. But so far she was 
starting to enjoy being stuck inside a girl&#146;s body.

She shivered in excitement as Madison&#146;s agile tongue played with her 
nipple, and she soon became aware of a hand drifting slowly down over 
her abdomen. She gasped in surprise and pleasure as Madison&#146;s nimble 
fingers slid into her underwear and gently opened her lower lips. She 
was in heaven.

&#147;Madison&#133;&#148; she whimpered out, tears of joy in her eyes &#147;Don&#146;t&#133;stop&#148;

With Stephanie&#146;s vote of approval Madison plunged her index deep into 
the demon girl forcing her tow arch her back in pleasure, clasping her 
hands in Madison&#146;s hair and drawing her closer to herself she moaned in 
pleasure.

While continuing her ministrations on the other girl&#146;s breasts Madison 
began to pump in and out of her friend, each thrust earning a louder 
moan than the last, then she decided to take it a step further and soon 
two fingers were pumping in and out of the demon girl.

Stephanie couldn&#146;t take it, the sensations caused by her lover&#146;s hands 
and mouth. Her body tensed as she felt the on coming tsunami of pleasure 
building up deep down inside of her and soon, it came and washed over 
her like a great flood of ecstasy, every muscle in her body spasmed 
together, her tail stiffened and her eyes glazed over.

When she had regained her ability to think, Madison had removed the now 
very sticky underwear and tossed it down with the rest and was now 
snuggling close to her love.

Stephanie hugged the other girl tightly, making a mental promise that 
she would spend the rest of her life trying to make her as happy as she 
had made her.

The two locked eyes once again, and bathed in the loving warmth that 
they saw in each other, and said as if they shared the same mind.

&#147;I love you&#148;

Madison snuggled closer to the demon girl, relishing in her warmth. 
Stephanie sighed contently and she kissed Madison on the forehead, 
smiling.

&#147;I think I should get a T.V. or we&#146;d end up doing this all the time&#148;

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t mind&#148;

The two laughed lightly and smiled then shared one last loving kiss 
before falling into a peaceful sleep in each other&#146;s arms. Safe in the 
knowledge that they were with their true love.
