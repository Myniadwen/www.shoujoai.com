<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>That October afternoon there came a knock at the door and Samantha sat 
upright in her bed, rubbing the tears from her eyes, &quot;Who is it?&quot; She 
inquired weakly. 

The door slowly opened and Trish entered the room, a worried look upon 
her face. Sam had noticed with each passing day that Trish&#39;s expression 
grew longer. She could see that the girl was trying to hide her own 
misery, she could sense it in the air around the girl and this only made 
Sam feel all the more depressions. She forced herself to smile for the 
girl, even though she knew that Trish could not be easily fooled by a 
simple smile, &quot;How was school?&quot; She asked, trying to make conversation. 

Trish sat upon the bed beside her friend and shrugged, &quot;Not much fun 
without you there.&quot; She remarked dismally, &quot;I got more of your homework 
so you can catch up when you feel like it.&quot; She stated, her eyes moving 
around the room as she spoke, not able to return her friend&#39;s gaze. 

Sam glanced down at her hands, &quot;Thanks...&quot; She fell silent as she tried 
to think of something else to say. Trish was the first to break the 
silence. 

&quot;Oh, Beth asked about you.&quot; She stated simply, &quot;She is worried about 
you, so is Lisa. Maybe they could come over sometime&quot; 

Sam let out a sigh; &quot;I don&#39;t know if I want to see anyone right now.&quot; 
She lightly touched the wound above her eye. 

Trish abruptly stood and stared down at the girl, &quot;You can&#39;t keep doing 
this.&quot; She suddenly exclaimed in anger, &quot;Do you plan to just hide in 
here your entire life?&quot; 

Sam shook her head, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know... I just don&#39;t feel like seeing 
anyone.&quot; 

Trish shook her own head in frustration, &quot;Is it because of us?&quot; She 
asked franticly, &quot;I feel as if you are avoiding me. You don&#39;t say 
anything at dinner and you just sit up here all day long. I can&#39;t stand 
to see you like this.&quot; 

Sam sighed, &quot;It is not you.&quot; She stated simply, &quot;It&#39;s hard to explain... 
you wouldn&#39;t believe me if I told you.&quot; 

Trish hopped onto the bed with one leg tucked under herself and the 
other hanging off the edge of the bed, &quot;This is me you are talking to 
Sam, not some stranger.&quot; She stated bluntly, &quot;Don&#39;t you trust me 
anymore?&quot; 

Sam looked at the girl to be greeted by a pained look in her eyes and 
let out a sigh of defeat, &quot;Alright then, if you insist, but don&#39;t blame 
me if I sound insane.&quot; 

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t make any difference.&quot; Trish insisted, &quot;I already know you&#39;re 
insane.&quot; She said with a grin. 

Sam growled at the girl, &quot;I&#39;m not insane.&quot; She swung at the girl only to 
have her duck out of the way and grab her hand. 

Trish gazed into Sam&#39;s eyes, &quot;That is the Samantha I grew to love.&quot; She 
said sweetly. 

Sam flushed and pulled her hand away, &quot;I... ummm...&quot; She ran a hand 
through her hair in embarrassment. 

Trish mirrored the flush and slid back in the bed, hugging the bed post 
and giving Sam some distance, &quot;Sorry about that... too forward I 
guess... I feel so different since tell you about how I feel.&quot; She 
glanced up at the girl, &quot;I wish you could tell me what is bothering you, 
I want to be there for you.&quot; 

Sam lightly closed her eyes and rubbed her head, &quot;It&#39;s so confusing. I 
don&#39;t know where to start.&quot; 

&quot;At the beginning.&quot; Trish insisted with a smile. 

&quot;If you insist...&quot; Sam took a deep breath and let it out, &quot;It started 
when my mother hit me with that vase.&quot; 

Trish nodded, &quot;I noticed something was up at the hospital, is it some 
kind of brain damage?&quot; She inquired worriedly. 

Sam shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t think so. I think those strange powers of 
mine just went into overdrive or something. Suddenly I found myself 
inside of someone else&#39;s body.&quot; 

Trish thought this over, &quot;Your mind hopped to someone else? Weird?&quot; 

Sam nodded again, &quot;The person I ended up in was very helpful. She seemed 
to go through this kind of thing all the time and helped me back to my 
body.&quot; 

Trish smiled, &quot;That was nice of her. I don&#39;t know what I would do 
without you.&quot; She said with a light flush, and then a shocked look 
crossed her face, &quot;Wait? Was she the second soul that Beth was talking 
about?&quot; 

Sam was startled how quickly her friend put the pieces together and 
slowly nodded, &quot;When I returned to my body our minds became linked and 
we shared thoughts and emotions.&quot; 

Trish suddenly clapped her hands together in triumph, &quot;That&#39;s why you 
kept looking so spaced in the hospital, you were talking to her weren&#39;t 
you?&quot; 

Sam could not believe how quickly her friend was following all of this, 
&quot;Yeah, she was helping me deal with everything that was going on and 
even helped me come to terms with the fact that I might actually like 
girls.&quot; She let the last words drift away in a mere whisper. 

Trish blinked at her friend, &quot;You talked to her about us?&quot; She inquired 
nervously. 

Sam lifted her head quickly, &quot;I was so upset about everything and when 
she asked me what happened it just all spilled out. The Meephit, you, 
mom, everything.&quot; She stated agitatedly, &quot;She turned out to also be gay 
and helped me through it all. She was very kind, but she turned out to 
be one year in the future.&quot;

&quot;The future?&quot; Trish blinked in confusion, &quot;How could she be in the 
future?&quot; 

Sam shrugged, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll never be able to see her again, 
because...&quot;  

&quot;Because?&quot; Trish gazed at Sam, more at the mark above her eyes, &quot;She is 
dead isn&#39;t she?&quot; 

Tears welled up in Sam&#39;s eyes as she lightly touched the scar, &quot;I... 
I... think she was...&quot; Tears flowed from her eyes and tumbled down her 
cheeks. 

Trish quickly moved beside her friend and pulled Sam into her arms, &quot;I&#39;m 
here.&quot; She cooed, &quot;You don&#39;t have to continue if you don&#39;t want to.&quot; 

&quot;I...I... can still see her mother bleeding on the floor.&quot; Sam said 
between sobs, &quot;and the blood on my hands. Someone... they...&quot; She held 
her trembling hands out before herself, &quot;They shot her and I c... 
couldn&#39;t do anything to help her...&quot; She buried her face in Trish&#39;s 
shoulder as she let out a tried sob. 

Trish held the girl tightly and allowed her to cry, stroking her back 
gently and whispering softly in her ear until Sam finally calmed down a 
little and lay her head upon Trish&#39;s lap. 

&quot;You going to be alright?&quot; Trish inquired worriedly. 

Sam slowly nodded her head, &quot;It is not as painful as it was a month ago, 
but today I realized that I lost the only connection I had to the girl, 
and the gift you gave me for my birthday.&quot; 

&quot;Mom told me.&quot; Trish remarked solemnly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry they didn&#39;t find at 
the hospital, and I&#39;m guessing you didn&#39;t find it here either then?&quot; 

Sam shook her head, &quot;I don&#39;t know where it went, but she had one just 
like it so I think it is on its way to her.&quot; 

Trish reached behind herself and pulled something from her back pocket, 
&quot;Here, you can have mine.&quot; She held the pink bunny over her friend&#39;s 
head and Sam sat up to get a good look at it, then at her friend. 

&quot;Really?&quot; Sam said with more excitement then she desired. 

&quot;Maybe you can find your Meephit with it.&quot; Trish suggested and set the 
toy in her friend&#39;s shaky hands. 

Tears welled up again in Sam&#39;s eyes and she felt the familiar warmth of 
the toy in the palm of her hand. It was just like her toad and she got a 
strange feeling that this Meephit was the key to her tracking down Star. 
Shakily she pulled out the device from inside the toy&#39;s chest and 
flipped on the switch at the back. Immediately the device came to life 
in her hand and started to scroll words across its digital display. 

&quot;Hello Samantha. How are you doing?&quot; It said with a blinking heart 
shaped cursor blinking at the end of the sentence, awaiting her reply. 

Sam blinked at the toy and glanced up her friend, &quot;Did you tell this 
thing about me?&quot; She inquired nervously. 

Trish shook her head, &quot;Not much, I just asked it about you a couple of 
times.&quot;

Sam returned her gaze to the screen and shook her head, &quot;I forgot how 
creepy this thing can be.&quot; She remarked with a small, weak, chuckle and 
began to type her question. 

&quot;Do you know where Toader is?&quot; She inquired of the machine and hit 
enter, waiting nervously as little hearts filled the screen. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; It replied. 

Sam could feel her heart racing at the thought that this might actually 
work and quickly asked the machine another question, &quot;Could you tell me 
where he is?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; It stated simply. 

&quot;Why not?&quot; 

&quot;Because he is in Fate&#39;s Hands now.&quot; 

Sam growled at the device, &quot;Tell me where Toader is.&quot; She demanded aloud 
as she typed. 

&quot;I am sorry.&quot; The device replied, &quot;He is destine for a new owner.&quot; 

Anxiously she asked the machine what she already knew the answer, &quot;Is 
Star the new owner?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Franticly she punched at the buttons, &quot;Can you tell me where Star is?&quot; 

&quot;Far from here.&quot; It stated. 

Sam snarled this time and tossed the device to the bed, &quot;This thing is 
stupid. It won&#39;t answer my questions.&quot; 

Trish picked up the toy and looked at it, &quot;Maybe you didn&#39;t ask it the 
right questions.&quot; She implied and glanced down at the digital screen 
while thinking. &quot;Hmmmm.... Is there someone who can help us?&quot; Trish said 
as she typed her question. 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Can you tell me who they are?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;Who is it?&quot; 

&quot;Bethany.&quot; Trish blinked at the screen and glanced up at Sam, &quot;Do you 
think it means Beth?&quot;
