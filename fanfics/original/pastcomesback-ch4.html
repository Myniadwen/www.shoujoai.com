<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 4 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>      Isaka sat in one of the dining room chairs, nervous. Krystal should have been back an 
hour ago. The demon couldn&#39;t help but imagine her yummy, sweet exorcist kissing some other 
chick romantically with the sunset behind them. She started to rock back and forth of the 
chair.

      Or were they already doing it?! She ruffled her hair as she tried not to think about 
it - Krystal sprawled out naked on the bed... smiling invitingly to someone that WASN&#39;T 
Isaka. She couldn&#39;t take it - she was going to go find her and beat that other girl to the 
moon!

      Just as she resolved to do so, Krystal unlocked the door to her apartment and walked 
in. The demon froze as the blonde let out a long sigh. Her hair was messy, her clothes 
disheveled and there was dust on her skirt. It didn&#39;t take her long to jump to a conclusion 
and as Krystal shut the door, she found herself being push into the wall by a teary eyed 
demon.

      &quot;Krystal... am I... is it because of last night...?&quot; The woman in question was greatly 
confused as Isaka pressed closer to her. &quot;I can&#39;t believe you did this to me... I... I love 
you more than anything and I&#39;m not about to lose you to some... some insistent hussy!&quot; The 
demon kissed her passionately and Krystal&#39;s questions only came out as soft squeaks.

      &quot;I&#39;m going to make you love me... you aren&#39;t going to remember her after this!&quot; 
Krystal was starting to catch on to what Isaka was thinking, but being thrown onto the bed 
disrupted her thoughts. &quot;W-wait,&quot; she managed to choke out. &quot;Isaka, this isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t what you 
think-&quot; She was cut off by another searing kiss as the demon tore at her clothes. And she 
really liked her outfit today too...

      &quot;No one can love me better than you...&quot; Isaka whispered in her ear, voice husky. 
Krystal shivered as she continued on, &quot;I&#39;m never going to stop and I&#39;m never going to let 
you leave me.&quot; The exorcist tried to push back so she could explain the situation, but Isaka 
was much too strong and she had no choice but to submit.

      However, she was saved by her phone ringing. The demon snapped out of her daze and 
looked down the hall. Krystal&#39;s phone... her phone was ringing... but who was calling...?

      Isaka practically dashed out of the room, leaving Krystal alone. The blonde girl let 
out a sigh, happy to be free. It wasn&#39;t that she disliked love making - it was just that 
Isaka was in one of her crazy moods again... She curled up in the blanket, happily snuggling 
in and falling asleep.

      The demon finally reached Krystal&#39;s phone, as she had left it in her purse by the 
door. She yanked it out and without checking who was calling, answered with, &quot;You 
treacherous whore! How dare you call this number?! I&#39;m going to rip you to shreds if you 
don&#39;t stay away from MY Krystal!&quot;

      There was silence on the other line until a recognizable voice came over the line. 
&quot;...as much as I like Krystal... I don&#39;t intend to steal her from you...&quot; The demon clamped 
her mouth shut. The person on the other line was Sakura. &quot;Uh... I thought someone... someone 
else was calling...&quot; Isaka managed to blurt out.

      &quot;Ah... okay...&quot; It was quiet for a full minute. &quot;I am not used to the phone, but... 
Abby wanted to call and see if you could come over next week on... Friday and stay until 
Sunday?&quot; Isaka peeked down the hall, suddenly embarrassed. She&#39;d just been about to ravish 
Krystal over and over again and now had to ask her if she wanted to go over to Abby&#39;s on 
Friday next week?

      &quot;I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll be fine to come over.&quot; There was another awkward silence. &quot;...okay. I 
hope everything with you two is fine...&quot; More silence, until Isaka said, &quot;Uh, yeah... we&#39;re 
figuring things out is all...&quot;

      &quot;Alright... I will see you Friday.&quot; Then the awkward call ended, leaving Isaka feeling 
like a nimrod. Okay, so maybe she&#39;d ask Krystal later - next Friday was still a long ways 
away. Isaka set down the phone and walked back to their bedroom. She could see blonde hair 
sticking out from beneath the blankets and saw a curled up figure beneath the sheets.

      When Isaka pulled back the blankets, Krystal let out a long groan. &quot;No... I&#39;m so 
tired...&quot; The demon leaned over her to give her a kiss. &quot;Mmm... I dunno Krystal - maybe we 
should go take a shower together first.&quot;

      Krystal just gave her a disgruntled look, pulling the blankets back up over her torso. 
&quot;I didn&#39;t sleep with her or cheat on you - I promise! So can you please stop? I&#39;m really 
tired...&quot; Isaka gave her a knowing smile. &quot;Mm-hmm. Which is why you came home all dirty and 
sweaty, right?&quot;

      She let out another groan. &quot;No... another shadow beast showed up so we had to defeat 
it together. She says I should be training my exorcist powers too.&quot; Isaka tensed up and 
turned the story over in her head. It was... it was plausible... There had been lots of 
shadow beasts around, so maybe...

      The demon flushed a bright red. She never did let Krystal tell her side of the story - 
she just jumped on her. Crap. Way to totally save your relationship... &quot;She wants me to find 
a teacher...&quot; Isaka perked up at the sound of that.

      &quot;What?! I&#39;m not going to let you get &#39;private lessons&#39; from her!&quot; Krystal took Isaka&#39;s 
hand in her own. &quot;No, no, no. She said she can&#39;t do it, so I have to go find a shrine or 
temple...&quot; She frowned at the demon and sat up. &quot;I wish you would trust me a bit more. I 
would never cheat on you.&quot;

      She gave Isaka a light kiss and fell back on the bed. &quot;Thanks to you, I&#39;m even more 
disheveled. Why did you attack me like that?&quot; Isaka played with her blonde hair. &quot;Because I 
was hoping to show... uh... my, uh... love? Dominance? ...hmmm.... I can&#39;t describe it - 
it&#39;s a common demonic reaction to this stuff.&quot;

      Krystal scoffed. &quot;Well, I hope it was love-&quot; Isaka caught her up in a fierce hug. 
&quot;Yes! YES! I love you so much Krystal and I&#39;m never ever going to leave you, my sweet, 
beautiful exorcist.&quot; Krystal settled in happily to the hug, trying not to laugh. &quot;You could 
have said that instead of scaring me half to death...&quot;

      And when Krystal decided to take a shower, Isaka willingly stayed behind. 

***** 

      &quot;I&#39;m really really really sorry, b-but I got ice cream, cake and- and, I got you a 
glass of milk, hahaha.&quot; Once Isaka realized how PO&#39;d Krystal actually was, she entered 
girlfriend suck-up mode. Krystal was currently sitting on the bed, staring at all the treats 
in front of her as the demon kneeled on the ground, begging for forgiveness.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry for doubting your trust and then proceeding to jump on you like a horny 
brat!&quot;

      Krystal sighed and started to eat. She was still tired.

      &quot;I am really sorry, Krystal... I just... after we talked last night I was really 
worried you would leave me, but I promise I will love you no matter what! Even if we don&#39;t 
age at the same rate, stuff like that just doesn&#39;t matter.&quot; The demon gave her a sincere 
look from her position on the floor.

      Krystal looked over at her and gave her a small smile. &quot;Thank you... but this means 
you have to let me train every day, now.&quot; The demon pouted, but didn&#39;t object. &quot;Those shadow 
beasts are a pain and I have to be able to vanquish them on my own. Otherwise, we could be 
in big trouble.&quot;

      Isaka relented and decided that Krystal was right... sometimes, Krystal would have to 
do things on her own. 

***** 

      Krystal sighed as she tried not to trip on the path. Isaka had been so morbid earlier, 
sad to have to see her leave for the day. The plan was for her to train and then come back 
home. However, the hours were pretty sketchy, but she would be sure to call the demon every 
night.

      For right now, she had to worry about actually finding a place. After searching 
around, she picked up on a rumor of a shrine hidden in the woods. It wasn&#39;t too far away and 
Tsuru did recommend trying to find someone to help her.

      Ah - that was right. Tsuru wanted to hang out again later. Maybe Krystal would be 
wiser this time and not spend so much time with the girl or be sure to call up Isaka if 
things went too late... so complicated.

      Her thoughts drifted away when she finally came to dusty stone steps leading up to a 
beautiful, well kept shrine. She walked closer to the entrance and heard some random 
humming.

      Sitting on the actual steps of the shrine was little girl, maybe 13 or 14, whittling 
away at a piece of wood. Her humming stopped when she heard Krystal&#39;s footsteps get nearer. 
The girl&#39;s eyes were a warm shade of hazel and she had long blonde hair tied in a low 
ponytail.

      &quot;Uh... hello,&quot; Krystal said and the girl got up to look at her. She was dressed 
normally, in jeans a t-shirt, vaguely reminding the young woman of Eveon.

      &quot;...wow,&quot; the girl said, going down the stairs to walk up to see Krystal. &quot;You&#39;re 
really pretty! And...&quot; The younger scrutinized Krystal for a bit, trailing off.

      &quot;Tsuki! Tsuuuuuki!&quot; The girl called turning back to the shrine. After a few seconds, 
Krystal could hear someone coming out.

      &quot;Hina, what did we say about yelling at the shrine? What is it?&quot; Another girl 
appeared, this one looking to be 17 or 18. Her brown hair was up in a lopsided ponytail, 
decorated with various clips, pins and ornaments. She was wearing a long sleeved shirt and 
her blue eyes were quite clouded, as though she&#39;d just been sleeping.

      She stopped to look at Krystal and came down the stairs to stand next to Hina. &quot;Oh, 
hi. Please ignore my sister,&quot; she said, placing a hand on the shorter girl&#39;s head. &quot;She can 
be quite strange...&quot; She also trailed off, giving Krystal an appraising look.

      &quot;My, you sure seem quite adept at holy power. Are you aware of the potential inside of 
you?&quot; Looks like Krystal found her place.

      &quot;Uh, yes! I&#39;m actually an exorcist, but unfortunately I have very limited training... 
I was hoping to find a place to help me.&quot; The two girls exchanged glances and brightened up.

      &quot;Of course!&quot; Hina said, quite eager. &quot;We&#39;re exorcists too and we can show all sorts of 
cool things-&quot;

      Tsuki put a hand on Hina&#39;s shoulder and steered her to the shrine. &quot;Alright, alright. 
You&#39;re still in training too, okay? Go clean up the mess you left by the steps.&quot; Hina pouted 
but obeyed her sister.

      &quot;She is right though. We can train you. I&#39;m still in training as well.&quot; They shook 
hands, but then Krystal looked over at Hina.

      &quot;You two are sisters? And... are you self training each other?&quot; Tsuki laughed.

      &quot;Well, I was meditating before Hina started shouting about you, but we don&#39;t really 
self train. We have guides and manuscripts to follow, but our big sister is the one who 
helps us out. She&#39;s quite good.&quot; Tsuki looked over at Hina, who was picking up the wood 
scraps. &quot;We aren&#39;t really related, I don&#39;t think. We&#39;ve just been together ever since we 
were young that I no longer remember.&quot;

      Krystal nodded and adjusted the pack on her pack. She&#39;d brought extra clothes and her 
sword was wrapped and tied around her waist. Hopefully training would be that hard. Tsuki 
motioned to her. &quot;Let&#39;s go inside. It will be nice to have someone else around and maybe you 
can meet our big sister.&quot;
