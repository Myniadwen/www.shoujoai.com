<a href="../original/allgirls-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>Nobody knows

Just why we&#39;re here

Could it be fate

Or random circumstance

At the right place

At the right time

Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired

To meld our lives

To make us

Fuel and fire

Then know

Where ever you will be

So too shall I be

Close your eyes

Dry your tears

&#39;Coz when nothing seems clear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Weary heart

You&#39;ll be safe here

Remember how we laughed

Until we cried

At the most stupid things

Like we were so high

But love was all that we were on

We belong

And though the world would

Never understand

This unlikely union

And why it still stands

Someday we will be set free.

Pray and believe

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

Save your eyes

From your tears

When everything&#39;s unclear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Wounded heart

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

In my arms

Through the long cold night

Sleep tight

You&#39;ll be safe here

When no one understands

I&#39;ll believe

You&#39;ll be safe,

You&#39;ll be safe

You&#39;ll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands

You&#39;ll be safe here

&quot;Resolutions, Part Three&quot;

Alexandra Blair stumbled into Miss Madsen&#39;s class for Literature and 
Writing well past the tardy bell, making her the latest in the entire 
group. She shuffled through the door, drawing obvious stares and a few 
bulging eyes, and tried shying away as she crept to her desk.

&quot;Welcome back, Miss Blair,&quot; greeted Madsen cordially. She smiled and 
nodded at the disheveled woman, adding, &quot;Your absence was greatly 
missed. I trust Miss Grissom gave you the homework assignment?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I got it done,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Good. Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not gonna die,&quot; she grumbled, shrinking into the back of the class. 
She avoided Ivory like a disease and crossed her arms defensively as she 
slumped in her chair. Nobody dared ask Madsen to do anything about 
Hail&#39;s tardiness; she was more unpredictable than a fish on a hook.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you think that way,&quot; said Madsen warmly. &quot;Well, with you here, 
class can now officially begin. Who would like to come up first?&quot; Olivia 
Johnson raised her hand and limped to the front of the class, and began 
her poem. Victoria subtly handed a small note to Alexandra while keeping 
her focus on her friend. The note read,

&quot;We really did miss you. Glad you&#39;re safe. Hope you wrote a good poem. 
Your friend and subject, VFG&quot;

And Olivia&#39;s poem read,

&quot;Ode to Trouble:

Because there is trouble in the world, we can know peace

Because people suffer, we can see joy

Because there is hatred, we know what love can look like

I limp, and I perceive running far greater

I wander lost, and light becomes precious

Where is the boundary, the line?

Where does trouble lead into solution?

Where does peace fail and come back again?

Circle of life? I await an end.&quot;

Applause scattered, and Madsen gave her a good grade. Victoria went up 
next, and since her study subject for that week had been Furious Hail, 
she devoted her whole poem to the scarred woman. Alexandra covered her 
face in humiliation, wishing she had stayed home and emaciated.

&quot;Furious Hail:

In Miss Madsen&#39;s class I

Assigned to her was, and

Trouble I did hear, for

Her name was a bane.

And at first, hostility. But,

Patience had I, and made many attempts

Like a spider recreating a web destroyed,

Robert the Bruce.

Alexandra Blair,

Gold disguised as iron pyrite

Penicillin in the shape of a mold

Music beneath the noise

Soul underneath frail skin.

My friend Blair,

She chewed me out, and

I joined her at lunch because she

Needs a friend. Love sky.&quot;

Her reception was a little different than Olivia&#39;s, needless to say, but 
Madsen still approved and so did many others (not Hail). Lilian 
surprised many people by actually volunteering next, and cleared her 
throat as she read, of all things, a limerick.

&quot;Today there is sun and the moon

And darkness will come very soon

But prouder I am, with my helping hand

I can endure everything till&#39; June.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all I could come up with,&quot; she said sheepishly. Madsen gave her 
a cool look, not showing any disappointment.

&quot;Well, some of the most beautiful poetry has been brief&#151;Dickinson comes 
to mind&#151;but just don&#39;t make it ordinary. May I ask what you meant by a 
&#39;helping hand&#39;?&quot; Lilian smiled shyly and nodded.

&quot;Gabrielle,&quot; she said. A few girls whistled, or wiggled eyebrows, or 
made various suggestive sounds. Madsen silenced them, and since Blake 
had been one of the girls whistling, she called her up. Baum strutted 
and whipped out her prose.

&quot;To my darling Usha and Mira:

Whether in grass or in heavenly skies,

Lost in the mountains of you,

I would sink into lowest pits for love

Risk dangers untold, slay dragons,

Conquer kings, for you my girls.

O Usha, skin of fairest copper, beaten and brilliant,

Hair as silky jet wings, eyes of warmth, lips rich and moist

And Mira, beloved dike, your smile

Is a hundred sunrises.

Becoming lost in your glee is great pleasure and

No luckier or happier woman may be found than I,

Blake Baum, the one who shares your love.&quot;

She bowed despite the few additional calls and whistles, and got a 
reasonable grade from Madsen. Ivory came up next and, no surprise, read 
a love poem she had recently written about everyone-knew-who.

&quot;Ancelin:

To know that she is happy, to know that she is warm

To know I am beloved, and she is kept from harm

I make my way through life, step by step each day

I love her deeply truly, in ev&#39;ry possible way

Annie dear, have nothing to fear, for...

You are always in my heart.&quot;

&quot;Sorry it&#39;s no good, Miss M.,&quot; she sighed in defeat, folding it up 
again. A few of the girls had laughed, but Madsen stood up and supported 
the poor lovesick girl.

&quot;No, it&#39;s perfect. Love is one of the key themes of poetry, and you 
expressed it well. Miss Walker, you were one of the ones I saw laughing. 
You&#39;re up next.&quot; X Walker smiled crookedly, rose, and swaggered to the 
front. She winked at Janine, who she had as assignment that week. Miss 
Bautista hid her face.

&quot;O Chewbacca,

You came and you were tall and hairy,

And your name wasn&#39;t Larry!

Chewbacca, a Wookiee guy who was furry

Well there&#39;s nothing to worry!

Chewbacca, so tall and so strong and so handsome,

I can&#39;t rhyme the word &#145;\&#39;handsome&#39;,

Chewbacca!&quot;

The class laughed, but it wasn&#39;t inconsiderately. Madsen&#39;s lips smirked 
invisibly, but she gave Walker a grade that was not too impressive. She 
then focused on poor Miss Blair, who had stayed hidden and bleak 
throughout the whole session.

&quot;Miss Blair, I&#39;m personally dying to know what sort of poem you made.&quot; 
Alexandra sighed and shuffled out of her seat. She pulled a crumpled, 
torn, badly-folded sheet of old paper from her pocket and stood in front 
of the class, hanging her head. She cleared her throat and began.

&quot;The world&#39;s skin covered with nails poking out like acne

Every step is a curse, my soul impaled.

I feel crucified upon the feats of madness, bleeding with thorny crown.

Slip a knife into my chest while I wander through the swamp,

You cut and hack like a butcher, sawing my bone and keeping me alive.

Prometheus&#151;god of Man, every day in agony, no savior in sight.

How could you do this? How could you throw me away?!

You took me and you tore me like paper, and threw me into Hell!

I wail each day from your scorn, my loss, and you sing and laugh,

Devoting your attentions away! I hate you!

I wish I had never been born! The whole world, rot in Hell,

Sadness and grief beyond the comprehension of mortals,

All the world&#39;s pain upon my shoulders, I struggle to breathe.

Jesus Christ is invisible; Hell is here; I lay naked on hot rocks.

Because of you, I am alone, the knife of hope in my heart...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Madsen, I can&#39;t go on.&quot; Hail wept bitterly, crumpled 
the paper into a ball, threw it away, and walked out of the room, 
sniffling. Madsen rose and chased after her, excusing herself from the 
room. She spotted her tortured student entering the nearest bathroom, 
and with a slight feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, she walked in and found Alex Blair 
moaning and weeping uncontrollably, her voice weak and howling. She 
cursed at her teacher and demanded to be left alone, but Madsen was 
adamant. She came closer and put her arms around the young woman, 
embracing her as she had done the first day, only with love and not 
ferocity. Hail poured tears onto her shoulder.

She stroked the young woman&#39;s ratty purple hair quietly, knowing to keep 
quiet than to say words that would hurt her more. Her class could wait 
on them; this was far more important, more personal and immediate than 
beautiful poems or even an education. Blair was crushed and despondent; 
she needed to feel love, even if it came from an unlikely source. At 
last, she seemed to calm down, and Miss Madsen released her loving grip 
a fraction as she looked at the wretched face of her student. It was 
locked in a grimace.

&quot;That poem was for a person in class, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; Blair nodded and 
sniffled. &quot;I thought so. You don&#39;t have to tell me who. It&#39;s okay. You 
did fine. I thought it was very beautiful, in a provoking sense. You did 
well. Ssh.&quot; She hugged her, then released her completely, though her 
hand was still in her hair. &quot;Do you need to talk about it?&quot; Blair 
sighed.

&quot;My story would bore Tolstoy himself to tears,&quot; she grunted. Madsen 
smiled.

&quot;Long and dramatic, eh? I&#39;ve heard many like it, but I can guess yours 
will be worse, right? Let me tell you a story; maybe it&#39;ll help you.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see how,&quot; sniffled Blair, reaching for toilet paper to dry her 
eyes. &quot;Miss Madsen, you&#39;re a tough girl. You don&#39;t look like the kind to 
take shit from anyone&#151;sorry, it slipped.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, you don&#39;t strike me as the kind that&#39;s ever seen a bad day, 
while my life&#39;s been a fucking Hell&#151;sorry&#151;ever since I was like ten or 
eleven. My parents got divorced then, and it&#39;s been downhill since.&quot; 
Madsen smiled sadly at Blair, and used both hands to caress her hair and 
face.

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised at how awful my life has been,&quot; she said. &quot;I can 
understand your pain. When I was a little older than you, my parents 
disowned me and forced me out of the house.&quot; Alex sniffled and nearly 
chuckled.

&quot;Oh. Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes. ...They caught me in bed with another woman.&quot; Now Alex did laugh, 
covering her mouth with her hand even as she cried.

&quot;Whoa, no fucking way! Madsen&#39;s a lesbian after all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m bisexual,&quot; she corrected. &quot;But my parents thought otherwise. Long 
story short, I got kicked out of the house, cut off from my parents, I 
never saw the girl again after a few years in college, then I got 
screwed over by this man I was in love with. I nearly ruined my whole 
career with a recent relationship, and I had a nervous breakdown on my 
first day as a teacher.&quot;

&quot;No shit.&quot; Blair laughed, not impolitely, and finally managed to stop 
crying. She wiped her face again, looking at her tough, pretty teacher 
in a new light. &quot;So the great Miss Madsen had her bad days too, huh? And 
you broke down? You don&#39;t strike me as the type. You musta seen some bad 
shit to freak out like that.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted her teacher hauntingly, &quot;the shit was indeed bad.&quot; Alex 
shrieked with laughter, nearly bowling over as she was treated to a rare 
instance of her teacher breaking one of her own rules. Madsen laughed 
too, having to shout to be heard. &quot;We&#39;re not in class, Miss Blair, and 
my rules don&#39;t apply, especially in this lavatory.&quot;

&quot;Sorry... it was... just funny.&quot; Alex looked beautiful when she was 
laughing carelessly, as if all her problems had faded leaving only what 
remained, the base and the truth. She settled and took a breath. &quot;So 
tell me, Miss Madsen, what kinda shit was so bad that you broke down? 
Was it anything like me?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, much worse,&quot; she answered, playfully grim. &quot;After I had a year 
with her, everything else was easy. You were a kitten; she was a tiger.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, right. Come on, nobody&#39;s that bad.&quot; Madsen&#39;s smile became eerie, 
the kind that said &quot;I know more than you do&quot;, and with three words, she 
convinced Furious Hail that she was telling the truth.

&quot;Mabel Leah Fionn.&quot;

Alexandra Blair froze in horror. Her eyes bulged, seeing Hitomi Madsen 
in a whole new light.

&quot;Are you serious? Firehands Fenrir? You tangled with Firehands Fenrir 
and lived to tell about it??!&quot;

&quot;Tangled, and tamed,&quot; she answered, a bit proud. Blair gawked.

&quot;That&#39;s impossible! Firehands Fenrir was like, Satan with boobs! Yeah, 
no wonder you broke down on the first day! She does make me look like a 
kitten! Holy shit!! Are you serious?! How&#39;d you handle it?&quot; Madsen 
sighed deeply and stuck her hands in her pockets, looking a bit to the 
side, in the mirror. She had only aged two years since those early dark 
days, and though she looked no worse for wear, the experiences weighed 
on her.

&quot;I had help,&quot; she admitted, &quot;from a very strong woman. Two women, 
actually: Miss Keeping and the Headmistress. Let me first say that Miss 
Marbel is even tougher than Mabel Fionn and I put together; she&#39;s seen 
things that would give anyone nightmares. Anyway, she knew Miss Fionn&#39;s 
weakness, and with Abby&#39;s&#151;with Miss Keeping&#39;s help, I was able to subdue 
Miss Fionn&#39;s violence and tame her into a more proper lady.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;d you do?&quot; whispered Blair, entranced. Madsen took a deep, dark 
breath, recalling the event with sharp clarity. She could still feel it, 
even two years later.

&quot;I confronted Miss Fionn alone, after class, around early September. I 
had managed to gain everyone else&#39;s respect in that class by then, but 
she was still hostile. I had had enough of her, and it was time to bring 
out the dirty weapons. So after we exchanged some words, I undid my belt 
and folded it.&quot;

&quot;You beat her?!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; answered Madsen. She rolled up her sleeve, exposing her whole left 
arm, and tapped it with her palm. &quot;I beat myself with it. I struck 
myself on the arm, where it&#39;s tender, and kept whipping myself in her 
presence. I did this about seven times before saying anything. &#39;Do you 
want me to go on?&#39; I asked her, nostrils flaring and arm red. Even Mabel 
was shocked after seeing that, but before she could answer, I whipped 
myself again. I was relentless. I gave myself huge red welts that didn&#39;t 
heal for a month, and I think I even bled. I began to sweat and breathe 
intensely, but still I kept beating myself, demanding to know if I 
should go on. Finally she could take no more, and begged me to stop. She 
became rather obedient after that.

&quot;You see, Miss Blair, sometimes the strongest people have the biggest 
weaknesses, and Miss Fionn&#39;s was masochism. She couldn&#39;t stand people 
hurting themselves; Miss Keeping uncovered this and relayed it to me. I 
know what I did was extreme, but a desperate measure had to be taken. I 
had to tell her how serious I was, and that was the only way. I never 
beat myself again, and as for Miss Fionn, she graduated and became a 
respectable member of civilization. After that incident, I could handle 
anything.&quot;

Alexandra Blair was aghast. She had known her teacher was tough and 
didn&#39;t take nonsense from anybody, but after hearing her horror story, 
she was stricken. Hitomi Madsen was beyond tough, she was fanatical. Not 
only did she show amazing strength of will, but she also never laid a 
hand on a student in spite of how much they deserved it. Blair began to 
think that, if she had continued her violent ways that first day, Madsen 
might&#39;ve whipped out her belt and reenacted the scene from two years 
ago. She was rendered quiet, until at last she found something worth 
speaking.

&quot;Wow.&quot; Then, &quot;I suddenly have an amazing feeling of respect towards you. 
Jeez... you&#39;re crazy. But I guess you&#39;d have to be to be that devoted. 
Uh... well. I guess I owe you an apology for that first day. I&#39;m sorry I 
acted like such a bitch, I just... was not going through a good time in 
my life. But now I think I can handle it after hearing your story!&quot; 
Madsen smiled faintly, rolled her sleeve back, and touched her student&#39;s 
shoulder.

&quot;Good, I&#39;m glad to hear it. And I&#39;m glad I finally earned your respect, 
Miss Blair.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Just one question, though. Why did you help me on that first day? 
Nobody else, well, really cared about me enough to stick it out, but you 
went the distance. Was it because of all the things that happened to 
you?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. You reminded me of myself around that time, so completely 
rebellious. Maybe I slept with that girl to spite my parents, and it 
certainly got the message across. I did turn out all right, but it took 
many years and a lot of discipline. I have a good feeling you won&#39;t need 
to work quite as hard as I had.&quot;

&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; she murmured, smiling meekly. &quot;You&#39;re way tougher 
than I am.&quot;

&quot;Well, I don&#39;t know. You live in Hell daily, as I&#39;ve heard, and I&#39;ve 
only made visits. You&#39;ve endured more; that endurance makes you strong. 
I admire it.&quot; Blair grinned broadly, and took Madsen in her arms as she 
hugged her and thanked her for caring, for sticking it out, for being a 
proper teacher and mentor when everyone else just ignored her or called 
her a hopeless cause&#151;for everything. Madsen returned the hug, but broke 
it after glancing at her watch.

&quot;Uh... I guess we&#39;d better get back to class before the others start 
worrying. Do you think they&#39;ve burned the room down?&quot;

&quot;Nah, they&#39;re all good girls.&quot; The two women smiled and returned to the 
class, feeling refreshed and healed after the heart-to-heart. Madsen 
apologized for her absence, and paused at the trashcan where Alex had 
thrown her letter. She picked it up and folded it out, still able to 
make out the words.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we can save this paper, but do you mind if I make a copy, 
Miss Blair?&quot;

&quot;Why? It&#39;s garbage, it belongs in the garbage can.&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. This poem is not hopeless.&quot; Blair blushed as she 
realized the full subtle scope of her teacher&#39;s meaning, and quietly 
permitted her to copy it to something cleaner. Victoria Grissom smiled 
as she looked over and saw the other woman with less of a burden on her 
shoulders; Ivory just looked, and felt dreadful. She knew who that poem 
had been aimed at.

.........

&quot;Uh, hey Haley.&quot; Blair stopped walking, crossed her arms, and turned 
around slowly. Ivory Tran was behind her, timid and penitent as she 
wrung her hands. &quot;I guess I&#39;ve been a real asshole, haven&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t deserve that,&quot; she whispered, an apology of sorrow in her 
brown-blue eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you felt like I treated you like shit. You 
deserved better than that, better than me. I&#39;m changing, Haley, I really 
am. I&#39;m making a lot of changes in my life. I guess I broke up with you 
because, uh... it was maybe the right thing to do.&quot;

&quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;I was... wrong. It&#39;s an old bad habit of mine, sleeping around and 
playing with girls like they were toys. I&#39;ve been trying really hard to 
lead a monogamous life&#151;&quot;

&quot;Because of Ancelin?&quot; Ivory swallowed.

&quot;Yeah. And I couldn&#39;t be fooling around with you while I was going after 
her. Look, I know I&#39;ve been scum, and I know I don&#39;t deserve either of 
you, but could you at least forgive me? Maybe slap me around if it makes 
you feel better?&quot; Alexandra sighed, and though it was tempting, she 
didn&#39;t feel very violent after the talk with Madsen. Besides, after 
realizing that people actually cared whether she was breathing or not, 
she understood that there were better things to do than hold grudges 
against flings like Ivory.

&quot;I&#39;ll forgive you,&quot; she grumbled. Ivory gave a sigh of relief and bowed.

&quot;Thanks. You sure you don&#39;t wanna slap me around? I deserve it.&quot;

&quot;You do, but... sometimes we don&#39;t get what we deserve. I learned a 
little bit about grace today; I deserved a lot for acting like a bitch 
in front of Madsen, but she didn&#39;t punish me. I guess I oughta do the 
same for you.&quot;

&quot;Really? Jeez, you sure? Cuz&#39; I don&#39;t mind at all. Really, take a whack 
at me!&quot; She turned her head around, exposing her cheek for Blair to 
smack, but she declined.

&quot;Nah, no thanks. I don&#39;t wanna ruin it for when your girlfriend goes 
over to kiss it. Are you two together?&quot;

&quot;...Sort of.&quot;

&quot;Then she&#39;d be unhappy if I slapped you. Go on, you go after her. I 
don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So... peace?&quot; Ivory stuck out her hand, hoping for the best, and 
after some tentative shyness, Alex clasped the other girl&#39;s hand and 
sealed the deal.

&quot;Yeah, peace. I don&#39;t think I can ever see you as a friend, Ive, but at 
least we can be civil to each other. See ya later.&quot;

&quot;Oh, um, bye.&quot; Ivory made a little wave, and parted ways with Alex. 
Blair had a feeling that as soon as her back was turned, the wild woman 
would jump into Ancelin&#39;s arms and embrace her, but she no longer cared. 
Ivory just wasn&#39;t worth it.

She had forgiven Ivory, but would Ancelin ever be able to forgive her?

In her heart, Ancelin had, well before that day.

.........

Students observed Furious Hail embracing Janet Keys lovingly, whispering 
her thanks to the matronly woman. Keys returned the hug, exchanged some 
words, and sent Hail to her seat. There was a definite lightness in the 
girl&#39;s step that day. She no longer walked like a condemned woman, but 
like someone who had reason to hope again, someone who had pulled out 
the knife from her chest and willed it into something more pleasant, 
like a box with an unknown present, or a paper just waiting for art.

Corona Marcos greeted her with a shy smile. It broadened as Hail 
actually returned it.

&quot;Hey, Corona. Listen, I owe you an apology. I acted like a fucking 
asshole around you and I didn&#39;t mean it. I&#39;m sorry if I hurt you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right. You weren&#39;t feeling well.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not all right, Corona. I was a horrible bitch, and I need to 
apologize.&quot;

&quot;Then I forgive you.&quot; Hail sighed in relief and smiled.

&quot;Thanks. Hey, nice picture. You making positive work for a change?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Marcos looked at her painting and smiled at just how happy it 
looked, contrasting her other work which had been nothing but gloom. 
&quot;Uh, yeah, I guess so. I guess I was in the mood for something 
different.&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot; Hail smiled, then reached for her easel and a brush. &quot;Well, me 
too.&quot; The two smiled and went about their work; across the room, Ana Lu 
jabbed Rai Zanders with her elbow.

&quot;Rai! Check it out!&quot;

&quot;Hmm? What?&quot;

&quot;Those two over there!&quot; she whispered. Rai glanced at them 
indifferently.

&quot;So?&quot; Ana giggled.

&quot;So!! Corona and Haley sitting in a tree! K-I-S-S-I-N-G!&quot; Zanders rolled 
her eyes.

&quot;Grow up.&quot;

The end of &quot;Resolutions&quot;
