&quot;You look good,&quot; Amara said with a smile. She tipped her head to the 
side, &quot;Of course, both the other outfits you tried on earlier looked 
good, too.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not helping,&quot; Allison looked at her with a frown. Her white 
shirt was crisp, the black pants that she wore starched and ironed. Her 
face had been scrubbed clean, the normally messy sandy brown hair combed 
back neatly.

&quot;You two really haven&#39;t gone out on a date before?&quot; Amara repeated the 
question.

&quot;No, we haven&#39;t,&quot; Allison made a face, &quot;I&#39;ve been firmly in denial, and 
Jenna&#39;s been kind enough not to push me.&quot;

&quot;So what are you going to be doing?&quot; Amara asked curiously.

&quot;Valentine&#39;s day dinner,&quot; Allison puffed out a breath. &quot;Kat tells me the 
place we&#39;re going is pretty gay friendly, so that shouldn&#39;t be a 
problem.&quot;

Amara looked over at her old friend curiously, &quot;From what I remember of 
our school days, you didn&#39;t date very much.&quot;

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Allison admitted. She shrugged slightly, &quot;Never seemed 
to meet the right kind of guy, even after I left school.&quot; A short pause, 
&quot;Of course, now I find myself wondering if it might have been because 
I&#39;m...&quot;

&quot;A lesbian,&quot; Amara supplied.

&quot;A lesbian,&quot; Allison agreed. &quot;So not I find myself looking back over my 
life, reassessing everything based on this new piece of knowledge.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t get too obsessive about it. I know that I had no clue about it 
all until I was in my twenties,&quot; Amara said with a shrug of her 
shoulders. The black haired woman smiled, &quot;Don&#39;t panic about your date, 
either.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s hard not to,&quot; Allison sighed.

&quot;Jenna&#39;s always made it clear she likes you,&quot; Amara said patiently, &quot;I 
saw that almost as soon as I met her. And I&#39;m pretty sure you like her, 
too.&quot;

&quot;More than I thought,&quot; Allison felt herself blushing. She shook her 
head, &quot;I guess that&#39;s why I&#39;m worried about messing this up.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;ll be all right,&quot; Amara gave her a grin. She got up, the black 
garbed woman striding to the door in her leathers. &quot;Have a good time,&quot; 
she offered, slipping out into the hallway.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Allison called out as the door shut.

Amara strode down the hall, the light shining off of the buckles on her 
tight leather vest. &#39;Valentine&#39;s Day,&#39; she thought, &#39;what an annoyance.&#39; 
She strode into the living room, hesitating for a moment in front of a 
comfortable seat on the couch. &#39;No, I don&#39;t think so.&#39; She walked on, 
grabbing her long leather coat as she headed to the door.

&quot;Banzai!&quot; The redheaded figure tackled her to the ground, looking down 
at her with a little frown. &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Milly asked while 
sitting atop Amara, her tail lashing.

&quot;Out,&quot; Amara got the catgirl off of her and stood up.

Milly bounced back to her feet, pulling out something from a pocket in 
the catgirl&#39;s maid apron and tossing it to Amara. &quot;Here, take this,&quot; she 
said.

&quot;A communicator,&quot; Amara looked at the silvery disk that she caught from 
the air in surprise. She looked over at Milly with a frown, &quot;Is 
something wrong?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Milly shook her head, &quot;at least I don&#39;t think so. But I&#39;d like to 
be able to get hold of you in an emergency, just in case.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fair enough,&quot; Amara tucked the device away in a concealed pocket 
in her leather vest. She stopped by the door and looked over her 
shoulder at Milly curiously, &quot;You going to be shadowing the princess and 
Allison?&quot;

&quot;Sharin and I, yes,&quot; Milly nodded. Seeing Amara&#39;s single raised eyebrow 
she continued, &quot;We&#39;re keeping an eye on them together, not going on a 
date!&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Amara smiled wryly. With that she slipped out the front door, 
closing the door silently behind her.

&quot;I hate it when she does that,&quot; Milly said to herself with a sigh, her 
little cat ears flicking back in annoyance. She went down the hallway to 
the bedroom Jenna was using to get changed. &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; she asked, tapping 
on the door.

&quot;Come in,&quot; Jenna called out.

Milly moved inside silently, turning to look at Jenna with wide eyes. 
The black haired young princess stood before her mirror, dressed in a 
matching set of lace bra and panties, with coal gray stockings going up 
to her thighs. She held a blood red dress in front of her body as she 
looked in the mirror, then a icy blue one.

&quot;Which one do you think looks better?&quot; Jenna turned to ask.

&quot;Red has always been a good color for you,&quot; Milly offered, &quot;and Allison 
will be wearing mostly black, with white accents.&quot;

&quot;Which will go well with red,&quot; Jenna agreed. She slipped the red dress 
over her head, tugging it down until it reached the top of her thighs. 
She turned, lifting her hair up, and Milly stepped forward to do up her 
zipper. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Jenna smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Milly smiled. She tilted her head to the side, &quot;Ma&#39;am, 
are you sure you want to go out without guards?&quot;

&quot;I want this private between me and Allison,&quot; Jenna said, carefully 
applying her makeup. It was mostly subtle, a bit of color to bring out 
the best qualities of her face. &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot; she asked Milly with a 
slight smile.

&quot;It&#39;s lacking something,&quot; Milly mused. She walked to the dresses, 
looking around, then came back with something in her hands. &quot;Here,&quot; she 
put the earrings in each of Jenna&#39;s ears, small and simple circles in 
the same red of the dress.

Jenna looked into the mirror, then smiled slightly. &quot;Perfect,&quot; she 
agreed, giving Milly a quick hug. &quot;Come on,&quot; she lead the way out of the 
bedroom and up the hallway, only slowing once they reached the living 
room.

&quot;Jenna,&quot; Allison turned with a smile, the black dress jacket she wore 
unbuttoned. The white shirt and black pants suited her well, going with 
the sandy brown hair and her healthy coloring.

&quot;Allison,&quot; Jenna smiled, her red dress bringing up her own natural 
coloring.

Allison blushed, smiling shyly. &quot;So,&quot; she hesitated nervously, then 
offered her hand, &quot;are you ready to go?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes,&quot; Jenna smiled, taking her hand. They seemed lost in each 
other&#39;s gaze a moment, then together they walked out the door.

Milly waited a few beats of her heart then cried, &quot;Sharin!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; the blonde haired warrior came out from the bathroom 
dressed in a simple black dress, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot; Sharin gave Milly a look, 
&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to change?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Milly looked down at her maid&#39;s uniform in confusion.

&quot;You&#39;ll stand out like a sore thumb,&quot; Sharin gave Milly a gentle shove 
towards the bedrooms, &quot;go put something more casual on, and hurry!&quot;

&quot;Right, right,&quot; the little redhead disappeared. A few moments later 
Milly emerged in a simple green dress, looking oddly uncomfortable. 
&quot;Well, let&#39;s get after them.&quot;

Sharin blinked, looking at the redhead in surprise, then she shook 
herself, &quot;Yeah, we don&#39;t want to loose them.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got a tracking device on her,&quot; Milly added.

&quot;Really?&quot; Sharin sweatdropped.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Milly nodded, &quot;It&#39;s in the earrings I had Jenna wear 
tonight.&quot;

&quot;That might be just a bit excessive,&quot; Sharin noted as they went out 
together, Milly locking up behind them. &quot;So where are Kat, Roma and 
Marilyn?&quot;

&quot;Watching the shop, I think,&quot; Milly replied. She hesitated before 
adding, &quot;Is it me, or does Roma seem to be eager to be around Kat?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not just you,&quot; Sharin said as they rode the elevator down. &quot;Where 
to now?&quot; she asked as they stepped out onto the street.

Milly looked down at the crystal face of her wristwatch, where a glowing 
indicator appeared. &quot;North,&quot; she said, leading the way quickly.

They moved through the city together, and Sharin found herself looking 
at her companion thoughtfully more than once. Out of her maid&#39;s uniform 
Milly was rather good looking, her green eyes lit up with the excitement 
of the chase. &#39;She really is kind of cute,&#39; Sharin admitted.

&quot;Well, this is the place,&quot; Milly looked up at the nightclub dubiously.

&quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket?&quot; Sharin read the neon sign thoughtfully. She 
noticed the women walking in as pairs and shook her head, &quot;Well, isn&#39;t 
this interesting.&quot;

&quot;Oh dear,&quot; Milly agreed.

&quot;Well,&quot; Sharin offered her arm chivelrously to Milly, &quot;we&#39;ve come this 
far.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Milly agreed, and the two strode by the bouncer 
together.</pre>
