The Ronin&#39;s reunion was interrupted by a sultry-sounding &quot;Hello&quot;, 
followed by a chuckle and an equally-silky, &quot;Hello, my two beautiful 
ones&#151;although I think you were much prettier as souls. But all creatures 
are like that, so hello regardless.&quot; The two Ronin tried sitting up, but 
being dead had taken its toll, and their skin felt like lead. They could 
see their visitor, at least, along with their surroundings: they were 
laying on a stone tablet, surrounded by walls of dusky gold, with 
etchings and strange drawings on them. Several torches dotted the room; 
decorations such as crimson tapestries, censers of incense, various 
treasures, and here and there an eerie skull were scattered around. The 
stone tablet they were laying on had runes carved into it, and wasn&#39;t 
too uncomfortable, compared to the pain of coming back to life.

&quot;And just who,&quot; Rin asked with a wince, &quot;are you supposed to be?&quot;

&quot;I am Kissa, the one who pulled you back into the world of the living,&quot; 
said their guest. Her voice was like a sweet harp or violin, and she was 
beautiful enough to match the sound&#151;bronze skin, smallish and svelte, 
hair reddish-black and eyes hazel, smiling. She wore a simple, white 
dress made of cotton, secured by thin shoulder straps. A large, 
gold-link necklace covered her breasts, as her outfit did not, and she 
smelled sweet in spite of being alive (the land of the dead was alive 
with fresh and wonderful smells; Kissa had no doubt dabbled in 
necromancy for long years to have that particular odor).

&quot;And you,&quot; she added after the briefest of pauses, &quot;are Rin and Kailin, 
I presume. Welcome back.&quot;

&quot;Piss...off.&quot;

&quot;Now-now, you forget who you owe a debt to. I will let you rest and 
recover&#151;the dead easily forget how to operate when they are brought back 
to life&#151;and I may even feed you, if you like. But soon I&#39;ll cast you out 
into that world and expect for you to do me that service.&quot;

&quot;Oh, right.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t have to kill anybody that&#39;s good, do we?&quot; wondered Kailin, 
wailing from the hopelessness of the situation. Kissa&#39;s perfumed, creamy 
lips twitched into a smile.

&quot;Well, good and evil are all based on one&#39;s point of view. People may 
see me as wicked, even though I bring the dead back to life, or people 
may see you two as wicked, in spite of what good you may do. There 
cannot be a universal definition of good and bad because no two minds 
can agree on everything.&quot;

&quot;Well, can you at least tell us who they are?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what I intend to do. I shall give you a list to follow; when 
you&#39;ve killed all eight people on the list, we shall be even. Oh, and do 
not think of trying anything suspicious: the paper I write with and the 
ink I use are both enchanted, and you shall be tied to it until your 
task is through. I will even send one of my servants with you just to be 
sure.&quot;

&quot;And who might that be?&quot;

&quot;Rest for now,&quot; Kissa smiled at them. &quot;After all, you have a long road 
ahead of you, do you not?&quot; She laughed and dismissed herself, leaving 
Rin and Kailin to gaze at each other in dread. They were alive, yes, but 
perhaps at a cost too high to pay. They could only hope that the eight 
people Kissa wanted them to kill were real threats, and their guide not 
the cruel sort. They soon fell asleep on that stone tablet, the runes 
surrounding them and pulling them into a deep, hopeless dream.

......

Kissa&#39;s servant turned out to be a beautiful yet tragic-looking young 
lady around Kailin&#39;s age. She had long hair, dark as charcoal, and her 
face was like that of an angel. Her eyes glowed with a mysterious pale 
blue light, and she wore a black cloak, perhaps to conceal her identity 
better. On the back of the cloak, the Ronin noticed, was a pair of 
dove&#39;s wings painted red. The girl nodded, keeping her eyes mostly shut, 
and handed them a sheet of paper that felt like it was on fire at first.

&quot;This Kissa&#39;s death list?&quot; wondered Rin. She and Kailin looked over it. 
Thankfully, they didn&#39;t recognize any of the names, which meant they 
would not be killing anyone familiar. They looked to the girl again, 
black against white, and asked her name.

&quot;A-angel,&quot; she stuttered. &quot;T-the G-guardian Angel.&quot;

&quot;Guardian Angel? Cool name.&quot; She blushed and hung her head.

&quot;Th-thank you. Uh...l-lady Kissa asked m-me to come w-with y-you...&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, uh...I guess we should introduce ourselves. I&#39;m Rin the Ronin 
and this is Kailin the Inferno.&quot;

&quot;Pleased to meet&#39;cha,&quot; said Kailin. She took Angel&#39;s hand, making the 
poor girl turn even more red.

&quot;Oh! W-what nice names. Um...uh...oh, p-please do not mind me. I-I shall 
just...come with you...on your journey.&quot;

&quot;No need to be shy!&quot; exclaimed Rin, who knew she would like the girl. 
&quot;We may look tough but we&#39;re not bad characters. You&#39;ll see.&quot;

&quot;We really are nice,&quot; added Kailin. Angel smiled bashfully, but still 
didn&#39;t raise her head. Rin noticed her companion staring, trying to 
optically pry open those luminous blue eyes, and poked her on the 
shoulder.

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we get going, Hsu? We&#39;ve got a lot of catching up to do.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. I think we should look for BaoBao first. The poor thing&#39;s 
probably lost and alone without me.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Rin didn&#39;t exactly get along with the panda cub, but she knew 
that there would be no rest for either of them until she was found. She 
personally wanted to check in with her parents, see if they were all 
right, and wanted to see what Snowblood was up to. Was that strange 
blind girl aware of their death and resurrection? If she was, what a 
surprise she was in for!

&quot;Well,&quot; said Rin, knowing they had lost enough time already, &quot;we should 
get going before Missa Kissa decides to put us to further use. What&#39;s 
she got you doing anyway, miss Angel?&quot;

&quot;Oh, um...I&#39;m not at liberty to s-say.&quot;

&quot;Meh, whatever. Knowing her it can&#39;t be good.&quot; Since neither knew the 
way out of...wherever they were, they followed Angel. It turned out that 
the Ronin had been brought back to life in some kind of pyramidal 
temple, where pagan magic rituals took place. That might&#39;ve explained 
their revival and the lack of scars on their necks, but it sure didn&#39;t 
make things any less creepy. The sun, they noted, was quite dull and 
uninspiring, but they became unadjusted to its brightness soon as they 
set out into the world.

As they journeyed, Rin and Kailin told their new companion about 
themselves&#151;how they met, the adventures they had gone on, that sort of 
thing. They left out their deaths, of course, and a few other things 
that nobody would tell a stranger. Angel made the stranger status 
obsolete by telling them about herself, once she got used to their 
presence. Her real name was Kathryn or Kathy O&#39;Hare, and she called 
herself the Guardian Angel because she literally saw herself as just 
that, an angel sent to protect those who were otherwise defenseless. 
Like the two Ronin, she had strange powers, but would not divulge them 
just yet, nor why she was Kissa&#39;s servant.

Neither Ronin thought BaoBao would still be at that beach where they had 
been killed, and they couldn&#39;t check it anyway because strangely enough, 
Kissa&#39;s temple was on a totally different continent. That made Kailin 
grow worried, but it also gave Angel a good reason to demonstrate her 
powers. After getting a good description of BaoBao, Kathy stood in an 
open area, flared her eyes wide open, and seemed to glow slightly. She 
stood still for about a minute, never blinking, and relaxed once her 
duty was done. The glow faded, her eyes closed, and she smiled.

&quot;BaoBao is several miles in that direction,&quot; she pointed to the 
northeast. &quot;I do not think she is in danger, but I may be mistaken.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot; Kathy&#39;s face turned red and she looked humiliated.

&quot;My...powers. I call it the Angel Eyes. I can see far better than most 
people&#151;lost things, such as your pet, are easily found by me. I can 
penetrate matter, and even people&#39;s neural process. I cannot hold it for 
long, so that is why I keep my eyes half-closed.&quot;

&quot;Oh. That&#39;s a pretty handy power. So you could see BaoBao all the way 
from here?&quot;

&quot;I believe so. It&#39;s a good lead at the very least. Come.&quot; She smiled and 
took Kailin&#39;s hand, knowing the young girl was worried sick about the 
panda. Kailin smiled from the contact and squeezed back; Rin, oblivious 
to everything except her new hunger, traipsed along carelessly, humming 
as she rested her sword on her shoulder. What she wouldn&#39;t do for a jug 
of sake right about now...

The Guardian Angel proved to be an excellent guide, taking the two 
across shortcuts and tricky paths that nobody would&#39;ve otherwise known 
about. She also warned them of any upcoming dangers&#151;not that there could 
be anything dangerous enough to concern those three. A group of bandits 
were in their way, but were easily taken care of. Angel did not require 
protection, as she soon proved herself capable in a fight. She didn&#39;t 
even get hurt, something even Rin couldn&#39;t boast of (she just assumed 
those eyes of hers enabled her to see all kinds of attacks, and respond 
accordingly).

Angel stopped to gasp in surprise a few miles later. She activated the 
Angel Eyes once again, and reported that a building was on fire, not 
very far away. Kailin wondered if BaoBao was in trouble, but Rin had 
something else on her mind.

&quot;I think I know where we are!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I recognize this place! 
It&#39;s been a long time, but...holy crap! I grew up around here! That 
house must be in my neighborhood! Aw, and what if it&#39;s my house!? We 
better hurry!&quot; She plucked Kailin and Angel up off the ground before 
they could speak, and ran as fast as she could towards the direction of 
the blaze. Soon they could all smell smoke; later it was confirmed that 
yes, Rin&#39;s house was on fire. She stood to gape and curse momentarily.

&quot;Sonofa... When I get my hands on the bastards that did this&#151;aw, crap! 
What if my parents are in there?! Angel, think you can see in there?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Kathy didn&#39;t need to use her powers at their maximum when 
she was so close, so it only took a moment for her to find something. 
&quot;Yes, I see several men inside there, most of them wearing red armor and 
carrying swords. There is also another man in there, wearing a blue 
kimono, and he is fighting them off.&quot;

&quot;Damn it!&quot; snapped Rin, crushing the ground with her foot. &quot;What&#39;s the 
old fool got himself into now? Can you see my mother?&quot;

&quot;I...think I see something else, but...oh! Oh no! Kailin, I see BaoBao! 
She&#39;s inside that house!&quot;

&quot;NOOO!!!&quot; The poor girl wailed and collapsed, too stricken with grief to 
do anything but cry. Rin snarled and forced her companion to stand up.

&quot;Get a grip! Don&#39;t just sit there crying! You can control fire, so help 
me out! Angel, you better come too. We&#39;ll need your eyes. Don&#39;t worry, 
Hsu and I will protect you.&quot; Angel smiled, in spite of how sick she felt 
from the smoke and fire, and went to search for some water to douse 
everyone in. Firefighters were already on the scene, but the blaze was 
uncontrollable, even against their hoses. Kailin stood before the 
inferno, knowing the deep intimacy of fire better than anyone, and 
commanded with a gesture for the flames to part.

They did&#151;but what a parting! It was as if the very hand of God had 
pushed the fire away.

&quot;Whoa! Did I do that??&quot;

&quot;No time to gape!&quot; screamed Rin, scrambling to grab some buckets from 
Angel. She had just taken one and was about to splash herself (Kailin 
refused, of course, saying that she needed to be dry for her powers to 
work), but as she held the bucket over her head, a voice called out to 
them.

&quot;Don&#39;t go in there, you&#39;ll kill yourselves! Just let it be!&quot; Splash! Rin 
shouted back, soaked and irritated.

&quot;Fat chance, lady! That&#39;s my house!&quot;

&quot;You lie!&quot;

&quot;You wanna say that to my face?&quot; The owner of the voice pushed through 
the crowd, and in the split second it took for the two faces to meet, 
they recognized each other.

&quot;Snowblood?&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear God...&quot; It was Snowblood, all right, and quite shocked to see 
(or rather, to know) both Rin and Kailin alive. She trembled and fell to 
her knees from the overwhelming blow. &quot;Rin, my God! Is that you!? I 
thought you were dead!&quot;

&quot;I was!&quot; she snapped. Kailin&#39;s scream suddenly broke her 
concentration&#151;she turned just in time to see the fire grow worse. Rin 
cursed violently and turned back to her adversary. &quot;Look, it&#39;s a long 
story, so I&#39;ll explain later! Right now I gotta save my dad!&quot;

&quot;So that is your father! I had heard rumors...&quot;

&quot;No time! We&#39;ll kill each other later!&quot; Rin sprinted off...

&quot;Wait! Let me help you!&quot; And turned around, flabbergasted.

&quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?! Didn&#39;t you start that fire?&quot;

&quot;I had nothing to do with it, I swear! You&#39;ll need me to find your 
father anyway!&quot;

&quot;Thanks, but we already have a great set of eyes. If you wanna help, be 
my guest, just don&#39;t get in my way!&quot; And with that she was gone for 
good, taking Kailin and Angel in with her, just as the house exhaled 
more flames and smoke. Snowblood, still reeling from Rin&#39;s sudden 
reappearance, found herself calling out to her enemy.

&quot;RIIIIIIIIINNNNN!!!!&quot;

I have lost you once, Rin, she said to herself as she gave the younger 
girl chase, but I will not lose you again! If we both make it out of 
here alive...I will tell you everything you want to know.

The fire around her broke her concentration. Snowblood screamed and 
shielded her face from the merciless inferno. Fire did not adhere to the 
rules of the sixth sense; it was unpredictable and thoughtless, and so 
she could not move her way through it. Her senses vaguely told her that 
Rin, Kailin, and one other were making their way through the house, 
fighting their way through&#151;whether by strength, skill, or persuasion. 
Every time Kailin begged the flames to recede, they did, but at a level 
that far exceeded her normal power. Snowblood coughed and covered her 
face, knowing the best time to move was right after Kailin swept the 
flames away.

Meanwhile, Rin was unaware of Snowblood&#39;s intrusion. She was just trying 
to survive the fire. Even with Kailin and Angel helping her, the house 
was incredibly difficult to navigate with so much of it burnt or 
burning. Angel tried leading the two of them to Rin&#39;s father, who she 
guessed was the one fighting the men in armor, but this was hard because 
smoke continued to get into her eyes. Rin had to break down a few walls 
and doors (briefly experiencing her nostalgic early years as a 
super-powered girl) to get in the general direction, and Kailin, though 
contributing the most, was wearing out and growing sick with worry.

&quot;Not that way!!&quot; they heard a voice scream to them from afar&#151;it was 
Snowblood&#39;s. Rin cursed and ran over to retrieve the &quot;stupid blind 
woman&quot; before she could get herself killed, leaping over pits of fire in 
the process. Poor Snowblood was suffocating from the smoke, and her 
lifeless eyes were wet and red. &quot;Going the wrong way,&quot; she managed, and 
pointed to a door. &quot;Through here. Can sense...(cough, cough!) 
presence...&quot;

&quot;Through there? Thanks. Kailin, take this crazy idiot outside before she 
dies! Angel, you go with her! I got a foolish old man to rescue!&quot;

&quot;Will you be okay?&quot; Rin flashed a grin and gave a proud thumbs-up.

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s me!&quot; She winked and scampered off, breaking down walls and 
ignoring the fire. Despite her surroundings, Kailin couldn&#39;t help but 
sigh.

&quot;So brash. Come on, Snowblood, we better leave. You don&#39;t look so well.&quot;

&quot;I...(cough, cough)...thank you.&quot; She and Angel helped the older woman 
outside&#151;it was easier to go out than in&#151;and found sweet relief upon the 
grass and cobblestone in moments. An ambulance was already on hand; 
several oxygen masks were given to the three brave (or foolish) girls, 
and two more were requested.

Back in the blazing inferno, Rin found her father and was amazed to see 
him fighting off the men in red armor. She knew he was good at making 
swords, but using them always seemed to be her forte. As he killed the 
last of them, though, she couldn&#39;t help but be impressed.

&quot;Well! Seems I inherited the right genes!&quot;

&quot;Rin Li Kyan Takamatsu!&quot; he screamed, as if looking at a ghost. &quot;What 
the devil...?&quot;

&quot;No time for a reunion, pops! We gotta get you outta here! Oh, wait&#151;you 
haven&#39;t by any chance seen a panda cub around here, have you?&quot;

&quot;You might say that!&quot; he yelled, surprised at her. He quickly ran over 
to a bookcase, pushed it aside violently, and plucked, of all things, 
the unmistakable BaoBao from a hidden compartment. &quot;I kept her safe! She 
came wandering around&#151;&quot;

&quot;Just run, you idiot!!!&quot; Rin&#39;s father apologized and made tracks for the 
back door. He told his daughter that her mother was safely in another 
house, and had been for some time, unless she had been foolish enough to 
run into the blaze. It was a coincidental visit to the neighbor&#39;s that 
saved her; the patron Takamatsu was more unfortunate, having been caught 
in the fire and subsequent fight.

&quot;Just who were those guys anyway?!&quot;

&quot;No idea, but they said I owed them my blood. I figured I had made an 
enemy.&quot;

&quot;You think?!&quot; Rin quickly picked him up and jumped as far as she could, 
bursting out the door and rolling on the grass. Several medical aides 
came (one splashing her with water to douse a stray flame) and treated 
them; firefighters continued to try and save the house, but Lord 
Takamatsu told them to give up. After all, he said, all the important 
things were safely away from the consuming fire. He then looked at Rin 
and smiled; she rolled her eyes and gave his dirty, hot face a kiss.

......

Once things calmed down to a reasonable degree, and Rin straightened 
everything out with her father, she joined Snowblood on the remnants of 
her front porch, which was almost completely smoldering rubble. A small 
staircase was all that was left; they sat down on it, not knowing what 
to say since so much had happened. As for Kailin, her reunion with 
BaoBao was sweet. Apparently the young cub had made its way to Rin&#39;s 
house, through one way or another (it really was a fascinating journey, 
but since BaoBao couldn&#39;t speak, nobody would ever know it), and ended 
up a victim of the fire, which (unbeknownst to everyone) the Crimson 
Blades themselves had started.

And for the record, BaoBao adored Kathy just as much as she adored 
Kailin.

&quot;It is good to see you again, Rin,&quot; said Snowblood at long last, showing 
a smile of relief. Rin mirrored it.

&quot;But you can&#39;t see anything.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a figure of speech, you dope. ...I thought you and Kailin were 
dead.&quot;

&quot;We were. It&#39;s a long story.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got time.&quot; Rin took a deep breath and explained how she and Kailin 
had sojourned to the land of the dead, which wasn&#39;t as bad as she 
thought, only to come out again after making a terrible bargain with 
Kissa. She also mentioned Ferret, whom Snowblood remembered from the 
tournament, and wondered offhand what had come of their new friend.

&quot;She&#39;s probably wondering the same thing. So a woman named Kissa brought 
you back to life, eh? I didn&#39;t think such a thing was possible.&quot;

&quot;Neither did we, but we lucked out. So what about you?&quot; Snowblood&#39;s face 
turned dark as she looked away. Dare she tell Rin how she had tried to 
avenge her death, only to fail? She did, and for that, Rin smiled and 
thanked her warmly.

&quot;I really thought I lost you,&quot; she added despondently. &quot;You were the 
worthiest opponent I have ever thought, and despite my orders, I&#39;ve 
grown fond of you. Knowing about your death only made things worse; 
there was so much I meant to tell you! I am sorry for not answering your 
questions sooner; I just thought it would make my job worse. But there&#39;s 
no point in hiding anymore.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re gonna tell me why you have to kill me?&quot; Snowblood nodded.

&quot;That and more. First, I would like to tell you my real name. Please, 
from now on, call me Setsuka Hinomoto.&quot;

&quot;Setsuka Hinomoto? Pretty name. Pleased to meet&#39;cha, Setsie!&quot;

&quot;Setsie?&quot; Snowblood&#151;Setsuka, that is&#151;turned red and coughed. Rin laughed 
and asked her to continue, favoring the new pet name. &quot;Setsie&quot; tried not 
to look too embarrassed as she resumed. &quot;Yes, uh, anyway...about that 
order. You see, the thing is...I have...a daughter.&quot; Rin gawked.

&quot;Whoa! Okay, that just about blew my mind!!&quot;

&quot;I thought it might. The thing is, though, my daughter is in the hands 
of a terrible enemy, who I don&#39;t know the identity of. I&#39;ve tried using 
my psychic powers, but to no avail. I&#39;ve been used by this organization 
for two years, sent on all kinds of missions and jobs. They said they 
would kill my daughter if I didn&#39;t comply, so I obeyed them. Eventually, 
my actions made me second-in-command. Some people, more kind than 
others, thought that I had worked long enough and wanted to get rid of 
me honorably, so they gave me one last mission and promised my daughter 
and I would be freed afterwards. Guess what that was.&quot;

&quot;...To kill me,&quot; whispered Rin, who was beginning to understand. Setsuka 
nodded.

&quot;Yes. The Takamatsu line was to be wiped out. Your father owed the group 
I was in a great deal of money, and since he was unable to pay, my 
superior decided to just kill him. I was ordered to slay you.&quot;

&quot;...Oh. And that fire?&quot; Setsuka firmly looked at Rin with her vacant 
brown eyes.

&quot;I promise, it was not my doing. I was merely told to not interfere, and 
to not let anyone else interfere. But when I saw you...&quot; She smiled 
faintly and looked away, bashful. Rin smiled gently and put her arm 
around Setsuka&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;I really am grateful. You did really good. And I am glad to see you 
alive and well. What&#39;s your daughter&#39;s name, by the way?&quot;

&quot;Kohona.&quot;

&quot;Setsuka,&quot; Rin announced, &quot;I swear to you upon the honor of the 
Takamatsu family and the sword I wield, I shall do everything in my 
power to save your daughter. Just so you don&#39;t have to kill me, of 
course!&quot; Rin was beaming, but it couldn&#39;t help poor Setsuka, who looked 
worse than before.

&quot;I thought you might say that. That is something you must not do, Rin. 
You don&#39;t know how powerful this group is. Even I am afraid of them. 
I&#39;ve heard that their leader, a man they call Sashuo, is so strong that 
he once leveled an entire forest all by himself, using only his sword. 
You are no match for him, not even if you went with Kailin.&quot;

&quot;But we&#39;d go together, wouldn&#39;t we? You and I?&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she shrieked. &quot;That would make things worse! If Sashuo saw me rise 
up against him, he would order his men to kill my daughter without 
hesitation! Men like him are worse than barbarians! You can&#39;t interfere! 
Please!&quot;

&quot;Then what the hell am I supposed to do?!&quot; Rin screamed. Snowblood was 
weeping&#151;she didn&#39;t want to lose Kohona, and she didn&#39;t want to lose Rin. 
She cared for them both too much. Rin calmed down and offered a worn-out 
handkerchief, which Snowblood quietly took.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she answered. &quot;I don&#39;t want either one of you to die. 
That&#39;s why it was so hard on me. I kept on hoping that a solution would 
present itself, but...the only way that will ever happen is if Sashuo 
and his band are all wiped out. And that will never happen! Not even an 
army would stop them!&quot; Rin wanted to argue, say how powerful she and 
Kailin were, especially with the addition of Angel and maybe even Ferret 
and Kissa, but the look on Setsuka&#39;s face melted her fiery heart and 
sobered her.

&quot;Is he really that strong?&quot; Setsuka nodded quietly. Rin cursed. &quot;Damn 
it, Setsie, I gotta do something! I can&#39;t just sit here and let this 
pass! I wanna fight even if I die!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not afraid?&quot;

&quot;Hell no! I told you, I&#39;ve been dead before, and it&#39;s pretty sweet. Now 
that I know the truth, I&#39;ve got nothing to regret! I&#39;ll lop off that 
guy&#39;s head and give it to you as a gift!&quot; Setsuka smiled sadly, knowing 
that Rin meant well, but she was still hopeless. She knew Sashuo better 
than most, and knew what he and his band could do.

&quot;You are a good, noble person, Rin,&quot; she sighed. &quot;It&#39;s too bad we had to 
be on opposite sides in all this. We might&#39;ve been good friends in any 
other circumstance. ...I am sorry, I have stayed too long. I must attend 
to other matters. Before I go, though, may I ask you a bold favor?&quot;

&quot;Sure, anything.&quot;

&quot;Will you let me touch your face?&quot; she asked. &quot;I would like to know what 
you look like, and the only way I can find out is by touching.&quot; Rin 
squirmed and grimaced. She wasn&#39;t exactly keen on people putting their 
hands all over her, even for a good cause, and besides, this was 
Snowblood asking the favor. Aside from the obvious intimacies involved, 
she would have to factor in the idea that a woman who had been asked to 
kill her would be touching her in a familiar way. So naturally, she had 
no idea why she even let her do it.

Setsuka smiled and gently placed her cool, rough hands on Rin&#39;s face. 
They were not only the hands of a warrior and a mother, but a samisen 
player as well, as she explained. That had been how she earned money 
before finding herself under the thumb of Sashuo. How she expected to 
survive once her term was up was a mystery. So many problems in her life 
needed to be solved, and yet here she was, gently touching Rin&#39;s face, 
putting every curve, line, and detail into her memory. At last she 
finished, and smiled.

&quot;You&#39;re very beautiful.&quot;

&quot;H-hey, cut that out.&quot; Setsuka smirked.

&quot;Of course, this will make it even harder for me to kill you...but I 
will accept this fate. Also, there is one other thing I have wanted to 
do.&quot; Before Rin could ask what it was, she already found out: Setsuka 
pulled herself close, hands still on Rin&#39;s face, and kissed her right on 
the mouth. Rin&#39;s eyes flared open in shock&#151;her mortal enemy was actually 
kissing her&#151;and despite the beginnings of bliss that were swelling in 
the pit of her soul, she grabbed Setsuka by the shoulders and pushed her 
away. There was no denying the look of pleasure on the older woman&#39;s 
face.

&quot;You...weirdo!&quot; screamed Rin as she wiped her mouth with her hand. &quot;What 
the hell&#39;d you do that for?!&quot; Snowblood merely chuckled, stood, and with 
the aide of her walking-stick, parted from Rin&#39;s village and her sight. 
Takamatsu watched her leave, wondering what sort of crazy thoughts had 
been going through Hinomoto&#39;s mind. What was that kiss all about, 
anyway? What a strange woman!

Still. It wasn&#39;t all that bad.

......

The trio (now a quartet with BaoBao in tow) set out on the road the very 
next morning, once Rin&#39;s father had recovered. He let her part with only 
a few words, and asked that just for once, she write back and tell him 
how she was. She promised, but only half-meant to keep it; Kailin and 
Angel, meanwhile, were happily playing with the panda, who was more cute 
and energetic than ever since reuniting with her &quot;mother&quot;. That she also 
liked Kathy might&#39;ve suggested something, but Rin didn&#39;t notice. She had 
other things on her mind, such as the large debt she owed Kissa. She 
looked to the list, read the names, and wondered if she would need to be 
forgiven for her actions.

&quot;For your sake,&quot; Rin whispered to the names, &quot;I hope we never run into 
you.&quot;
