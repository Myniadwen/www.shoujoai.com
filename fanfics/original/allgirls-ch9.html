<h1>All Girls School (part 9 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

Nominations for Presidency of the student body would officially be held 
in the debate room, which would itself quickly be abuzz with activity 
once a few young politicians found their way inside. Usha Krishnan sat 
alone in the room, quiet and keeping to herself with her hands nestled 
in her lap. Her expression was empty, but from time to time she would 
sigh, and a wave of disappointment would cross her cheeks. Her 
wood-colored eyes flickered sadly, as if they had expected to see some 
good competition this year. Her first year was different, but only 
because so many seemed eager for the job. Once she gained a reputation 
for being excellent in politics, nobody wanted to bother. That left her 
the default President for sophomore class; perhaps junior year would be 
different?

&quot;That&#39;s the fifth time you sighed,&quot; noted the older woman who had been 
assigned to take care of paperwork. Usha just frowned and tried not to 
fidget. She had the option of leaving, of course, but she wanted to stay 
to see her rivals personally. Krishnan was not the kind to revel in 
victories and sulk over losses; she enjoyed the challenge and the 
freshness of good competition. Besides, in spite of how odd it seemed or 
how it might&#39;ve damaged her career, she really wanted to hear what the 
other girl had to say. But there was no other girl. She was alone. The 
minutes dwindled.

&quot;Well,&quot; sighed the only other woman in the room, &quot;looks like you&#39;re--&quot;

&quot;Hello!&quot; came a voice from behind. Usha twisted to see who it was; the 
woman cleared her throat.

&quot;I didn&#39;t think anybody else would even come! Are you nominating 
somebody, young lady?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I am, myself.&quot;

&quot;I see!&quot; exclaimed the woman, plainly sounding surprised. Usha rubbed 
her eyes and stood, formally, to inspect her supposed rival. She did not 
carry herself with dignity like Usha did, and certainly didn&#39;t seem to 
have the ambition or the credential to be of any concern--yet Krishnan 
kept a very open mind, and reasoned that a more &quot;down to earth&quot; 
candidate, as this girl seemed, would be just as healthy a competitor.

&quot;And your name?&quot; asked the so-called records keeper.

&quot;Mira van Dijk. M-I-R-A, V-A-N, D-I-J-K. Three words.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, Miss Dijk.&quot;

&quot;Uh, van Dijk, please.&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry. Uh, thanks, Miss van Dijk.&quot; Usha smiled. So her competitor 
was Dutch, eh? Mira looked it, if Dutch people were tall and ample. Mira 
wore black jeans that had been faded and scratched through many years of 
rough abuse, and a flashy Inuyasha Tee-shirt. She had eyes like a loving 
storm, gray as the skies of a rainfall, and her fireball hair shagged 
down just to the lobes of her ears. She had a big smile and no jewelry 
to speak of, and spoke thickly with an accent.

&quot;Miss van Dijk,&quot; said Usha clearly, &quot;namaste. I&#39;m glad to have a 
competitor this year, but I can&#39;t help but wonder what credential you 
may have to run. Do you have a background in politics, or are you... I 
mean, I don&#39;t wish to offend you...&quot;

&quot;Oh, hello!&quot; exclaimed Mira cheerfully, taking notice of the smaller 
Usha. She then attempted to remember what she had been asked, and barely 
slipped. &quot;Uh, you want to know why I put myself up to this? Well, many 
reasons. Do you have time to hear them?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid not right now. Might I have the gist of it?&quot;

&quot;...Gist? Ah, so sorry, I&#39;ve not been in America very long. I was born 
in Holland and moved with family not long ago...&quot;

&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; managed Usha, trying to stop Mira&#39;s introduction while not 
being rude. &quot;Uh, as I was saying, might you just give me the, uh, short 
version?&quot;

&quot;Short version? Ah! Uh...&quot; Mira paused and hummed out an &quot;uhhhhh&quot; for 
awhile, causing Usha to believe that she definitely had no experience at 
all. What she said next confirmed it: &quot;For fun!!&quot;

&quot;You cannot possibly believe that politics is entertaining,&quot; insisted 
Krishnan. The two girls would&#39;ve unfortunately traded words all day if a 
tiny, rough sound hadn&#39;t interrupted them.

&quot;Girls, if you&#39;ll continue your, eh, debate somewhere else, I&#39;ll run 
these papers off so you can begin your campaign.&quot; Usha moved from 
staring down Mira to the officiator quickly.

&quot;Is nobody else coming?&quot;

&quot;The time is up. It looks like it&#39;s just the two of you.&quot; The woman 
shrugged, and shooed the girls out of the room so she could work. Mira 
and Usha, two opposites in terms of political upbringing and ambition, 
froze awkwardly and tried to remedy it.

&quot;So... you want to be President of the Junior class for fun, correct? 
For entertainment?&quot; Mira gave a gay shrug of indifference.

&quot;I thought it would be a fun thing to try. My parents are always saying 
I am too political for my own good, and some friends think it would be a 
good idea. Besides, I need to change myself. I need to stop being lazy, 
and why not pick a hard job? I am also stubborn, so what else would I 
need?&quot;

&quot;Experience,&quot; said Usha, almost in shock. Mira gave another shrug.

&quot;I will learn quickly. Anyway, you know my name, so what is yours? I 
can&#39;t call my campaign rival Miss all the time, and I don&#39;t think you 
speak good Dutch.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she said truthfully. She bowed and managed a smile in spite of 
doubting Mira&#39;s abilities and motives, and introduced herself. Mira 
smiled and took Usha&#39;s hand.

&quot;Yusha Krishnan! It is good to meet you! I hope we have many refreshing 
encounters from now on. Can&#39;t be friends now; must get to class, yes?&quot; 
And with that, Mira laughed and left Usha in a puzzled state. Was she 
being polite or merely quirky?

Mira van Dijk... She was a confusing one. Usha unearthed a little bit of 
info about her from the flock of friends she associated with, and found 
that her rival did indeed have no official experience. She had good 
knowledge and a strong, socialist mind, and could probably relate to the 
&quot;common woman&quot; better than Usha could. She had also admitted to being 
lazy, so that proved she knew her own weaknesses, and she even expressed 
a desire to change her ways. For once, Krishnan thought, she might have 
a rival worthy of respect. She began her campaign within the hour; Mira 
van Dijk, procrastinating already, popped inside the school&#39;s anime club 
and yakked about Evangelion.

Usha had history, science, languages, mathematics, study hall, and 
debate--one of which she actually shared with Mira, although she had 
been unaware of it till&#39; recently. She was busy most hours of her school 
day except for lunch and study hall, which she used to work on her 
campaign (and, in the previous two years, she had used it to work for 
the school as president). She needed an angle, a reason her fellow 
classmates should continue to vote for her. Resting on her laurels was 
never her style, so Usha went the fresh way and rethought her strategy. 
What did she want to accomplish? What did her friends expect out of her? 
What could she do to help the school?

Mira saw her first episode of Stratos 4 and loved it.

&quot;So,&quot; said Ruth as she and the entire group sat around their &quot;leader&quot;, 
&quot;another year solo?&quot; Without lifting her eyes from her work, Usha 
responded.

&quot;No, there was another girl nominated.&quot;

&quot;Oh really? Anyone we know?&quot;

&quot;No, she doesn&#39;t seem to have any political agenda or ambition. She said 
she was doing it for fun.&quot;

&quot;For fun? Well that&#39;s an easy win!&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; she replied numbly. &quot;The girl appeared inadequate 
but I&#39;ve learned not to trust first impressions. We spoke briefly after 
we met, and she seems like she&#39;d give me a good run.&quot;

&quot;Well who is it?&quot;

&quot;Her name is Mira, Mira van Dijk.&quot; A pause.

&quot;Never heard of her.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s Dutch. She&#39;s really supposed to be a sophomore, but because she 
has a weird birthday and there were some immigration matters that came 
up, she&#39;s a junior.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s weird! How do you know all this?&quot;

&quot;I researched,&quot; she replied with a witty smile. &quot;You know I like to look 
into who I&#39;m going up against. I like to see their integrity.&quot;

&quot;Oh, spying on the &#145;enemy&#39;, eh?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&quot; snapped Usha. &quot;She&#39;s not an enemy. This isn&#39;t 
like a war, it&#39;s just two girls going after the same thing. She&#39;s a 
rival, an adversary.&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay... yeesh, sorry. So how old is she?&quot;

&quot;Fifteen, but not for long. As I said, her birthday...&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah. Well, you&#39;re not that far apart in age.&quot; Usha just mumbled and 
resumed her work. She had a system of going about campaigns, but she 
never liked doing the same thing twice, or becoming complacent. Mira was 
a fresh face who would have bold new ideas, and Usha knew better than to 
underestimate her. She would need to work her best if she wanted to keep 
her position--something she had not done since freshman year. Already 
she was starting to like Mira. After all, she had brought out this great 
determination.

Mira van Dijk laughed out loud at the antics of Tenchi Masaki and his 
harem.

&quot;So she&#39;s from Holland and the other&#39;s from India?&quot;

&quot;Well, Usha was born in England, but her parents moved here when she was 
like two.&quot;

&quot;Her father&#39;s Indian.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;cha girls talkin&#39; about?&quot; Gabrielle, with Lilian quietly in tow, 
joined her friends and &quot;extended friends&quot; together at the picnic table. 
School was out and the day was still nice, so the five friends decided 
to take advantage of the weather and have a meeting outside. Most 
brought their homework; some forgot it. Along with the five girls were 
their &quot;other&quot; homework assignments, the girls they were charged with 
studying and befriending. Altogether they made ten, and except for Ivory 
and Furious Hail, the entire class of Miss Madsen&#39;s first hour 
Literature and Writing was there.

Olivia answered Gabrielle&#39;s question with, &quot;My homework assignment just 
nominated herself as President of the Junior class.&quot;

&quot;Really? That&#39;s great! What&#39;s your name again?&quot; Mira reintroduced 
herself, and Gabrielle smiled. She pulled Lilian into the mixture, sat 
down, and sighed. Then she smiled as an idea came to her.

&quot;Hey, listen: Miss Madsen&#39;s gonna ask all of us to get acquainted one 
way or another, so I figure since we&#39;re all here, we may as well start.&quot;

&quot;We already know who you are,&quot; murmured X Walker. &quot;People like you 
aren&#39;t hard to remember.&quot; The redhead didn&#39;t know how to take that 
comment, so she just grunted and asked everyone else&#39;s names. Then she 
introduced Lilian, who hated being in large crowds.

&quot;Don&#39;t be shy, sit down! You know, I got a good look at that picture you 
drew. It&#39;s really great!&quot;

&quot;Uh, danke shoen.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re really running for office, uh, Mira?&quot; asked May. The 
anime-lover nodded. &quot;But why? I mean, this is my senior year, so I&#39;ve 
seen what Miss Krishnan can do. What do you think you&#39;d do if you were 
elected?&quot;

&quot;Honestly, I haven&#39;t an idea. I guess I would just do what had to be 
done.&quot;

&quot;Swell answer!&quot; sang Zane. &quot;Me? I don&#39;t get into that election crap. I 
can&#39;t even vote yet, so what&#39;s the point?&quot;

&quot;Hey, what happened to your accent?&quot; asked Blake. Aintzane gave her 
usual toothy grin and absently knocked on the table.

&quot;Oh, mean you this?&quot; she said, sounding very French. &quot;Oui, I can 
disguise it, use it, and discard it at will. Being trilingual has many 
advantages.&quot;

&quot;So you were faking?&quot; Zane leaned back and sipped down some juice she 
had brought.

&quot;Well, I guess it worked. Anyway, I&#39;m not worried about who&#39;s gonna be 
president or what accent I should take. I&#39;m more concerned about making 
the soccer try-outs and what I should wear for my next date. I make my 
own clothes.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Naturally, more than a handful of the girls became intrigued. 
&quot;Professionally?&quot;

&quot;Nah, amateur, but I&#39;d like to be a pro someday. Maybe some of you could 
be my models. It&#39;s difficult getting my mother to wear my stuff since 
she doesn&#39;t quite agree with my tastes. Blake, you ever modeled before?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no, but...&quot;

&quot;Are you blushing?&quot;

&quot;Oh my god, am I?&quot;

&quot;You never blush!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been asked to model before!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve never done a lotta stuff,&quot; murmured Gabrielle. Blake stuck her 
tongue out. May frowned.

&quot;Uh, lemme guess--it&#39;s like this all the time.&quot; Janine nodded her head.

&quot;They act like sisters, don&#39;t they? Oh, that&#39;s right! You&#39;ve got a 
sister, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, June. Would you like to meet her?&quot;

&quot;Well, if I want that A, I guess I have no choice.&quot; May smiled warmly, 
and reasoned that she and Janine would probably get along well. Poor 
Lilian was almost ignored by Gabrielle, which was just fine for her, and 
both Blake and Zane seemed to hit it off instantly. The conversations 
changed sides as quick as a strong wind, leaving the quieter girls 
muted. Victoria, who was very intimidated by Alex Walker, much liked the 
silence and was glad she had not been called to make an opinion. But 
more than likely, she would be the one to break the wild blather, which 
she feared.

&quot;So what kind of campaign do you think you&#39;ll have?&quot; managed Olivia, 
just barely audible over everyone else&#39;s words. She was talking to Mira, 
of course.

&quot;Campaign? Oh, I have no idea. I just went there for fun, really, plus I 
need to stop being lazy. I thought it would be a good chance to stop my 
bad habits.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. Well, I&#39;m no activist myself, and frankly I&#39;ll be relieved 
when this Bush-Kerry nonsense is behind us all, but I can certainly give 
you some advice.&quot;

&quot;Really? I would like that!&quot; Olivia just had to smile. Mira was sweet 
and enthusiastic, and easy to relate to in spite of her foreign 
heritage. Usha, for all her accomplishments, was just not a down to 
earth girl.

&quot;Well, start out by taking a survey. You could go around the school and 
ask your classmates what their concerns and needs are, and what they&#39;d 
like for their president to achieve. I know it wouldn&#39;t be very good of 
you just to bend to their whims, but it&#39;d be a good start. You&#39;d also 
interact with your public more, get to know them, and let them see your 
face. Please, please, more than anything else, don&#39;t hide behind a desk 
or a suit.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, I would never!&quot; Mira made a face and sneered, which actually made 
Olivia glad. &quot;I detest dresses anyway, and I like being friends too much 
to be so alone.&quot;

&quot;And what else do you like?&quot;

&quot;South Park!&quot;

&quot;Shoot!!&quot; blurted Olivia suddenly, surprising her classmate. &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe it! You know what I should&#39;ve done?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I should&#39;ve written down something about everyone when they introduced 
themselves the first day! That way--&quot;

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t have to work so hard, right?&quot; Victoria blushed suddenly as 
she realized what she had blurted out. Someone snickered, and 
thankfully, Olivia didn&#39;t take it badly.

&quot;Ah... well, okay, so I can be guilty of laziness as well. But I 
really...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine,&quot; said Mira politely. &quot;I do not mind. It would be good to 
have more friends. I really don&#39;t have many anyway.&quot; Olivia sighed, and 
since the whole thing was still fresh on her mind, she took out a sheet 
of paper and wrote a few things down: Mira van Dijk, 15 yrs., from 
Holland, likes South Park &amp; anime, running for class president...

&quot;So was that the something you took out of your report?&quot; asked Blake 
suddenly. Mira was jarred and took awhile to think of what Baum was 
talking about. &quot;You know, when you gave that report about your salad, 
you said you omitted something and that it was personal. It&#39;s kinda 
weird for me to remember something like that, but the report was so 
engaging...&quot;

&quot;Thank you!&quot; exclaimed Mira cheerfully. Blake smiled too, though a 
little weakly. &quot;Ah, well, yes, I had actually planned on making myself 
go for presidency, and put it in my report by mistake. It had nothing to 
do with my salad, and it was very personal...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see. Well, um, I guess Liv and I&#39;ll be the first ones to support 
you.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; murmured X Walker, who had been staring off into the air most 
of the day. &quot;That other girl&#39;s too goody-goody for me. I hate people who 
act like they&#39;re superior to everyone else. But you&#39;re cool.&quot; Mira 
smiled humbly and thanked them all for their support. Strange indeed, it 
was, for an inexperienced newcomer to have such support so soon. Mira 
couldn&#39;t grasp it any better than Usha could.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Usha smiled as always as she sat with her friends, and began 
without losing a beat: &quot;Well, I&#39;ve come up with several campaign angles 
already, and I&#39;ve run them by some of the women in this school. Of 
course, I did feel embarrassed when I overheard their surprise at me 
having a competitor, but I suppose my reputation really precedes me.&quot;

&quot;So whaddya have?&quot; they asked. Usha spread out some papers, notes she 
had taken during the course of her contemplation, and began her outline. 
Not long into it, her companions already began to figure what might work 
and what would fail, leaving Usha temporarily out of the discussion. She 
overheard a sharp laugh and twisted around to see, not too far off, Mira 
van Dijk laughing with her friends. The campaign has begun and she is 
appearing so lively? Is she really doing this for fun, or is this her 
way...?

&quot;Usha, I think we&#39;ve come to a general agreement,&quot; said Bonnie, breaking 
her friend&#39;s concentration. Usha turned and tried smiling.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;All right--what you&#39;re trying to do here is reach out to only a small 
minority of the junior class. You&#39;re being too eloquent here, and some 
of the girls here probably wouldn&#39;t understand this.&quot; (Her hands 
traveled from page to page, indicating as she said what worked and what 
didn&#39;t) &quot;Also, I think it&#39;s a safe bet to say that some of the girls 
have recently been stirring up talk about wanting to enroll boys here.&quot;

&quot;What nonsense,&quot; murmured Usha quietly. &quot;I bear them no offense, but 
Stanton is quite well enough as it is. I&#39;d think the addition of males 
would--&quot;

&quot;Distract them, right. Well, it won&#39;t pass anyway, so forget it. Now 
what about this idea of extending lunch by five minutes?&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be chosen simply because of one ideal,&quot; replied Usha. The 
laughter distracted again, and so did Mira&#39;s merriment. Suddenly she 
yearned, very much so, to part herself from her work and join in that 
fun. How she had sometimes rebelled against her own ways and yearned for 
a freer, less stressful life! But she probably wouldn&#39;t be able to 
handle it, being so used to the load and the strangely calming chaos. 
Still, the desire tore her apart from her campaign for awhile, and with 
a meek &quot;Excuse me&quot;, Usha picked up her papers and her tray, left her 
friends, and stood shyly over Mira&#39;s group. She didn&#39;t recognize anyone 
else there.

&quot;Um, excuse me?&quot; she managed over the noise. A few people stopped 
talking and laughing, and Mira smiled as she looked up.

&quot;Oh, hello and good afternoon, Yusha! How do you like the history 
homework?&quot;

&quot;I had it finished,&quot; she breathed, and decided not to brag by adding 
&quot;ages ago&quot;. That was her weakness, sometimes, and she hated it. Mira 
still sulked.

&quot;Rats! I haven&#39;t even begun! But I say, you are only young once, and why 
waste such precious moments with youth and friends on work? I can work 
when I have a job! You are joining us? Sit down, please!&quot;

&quot;Uh, all right.&quot; Notwithstanding Mira&#39;s aimless conversation, Usha 
smiled and tried to at least listen in on what they were talking about. 
But it was so much more different than what she was used to! It seemed 
so common, so trivial, like these girls didn&#39;t care about broader things 
like the world or its organizations! All they cared about was... stuff.

&quot;So what&#39;s your story about?&quot;

&quot;Well, I&#39;m trying not to go for a sex scene this time. I&#39;ve had so much 
sex in my stories that I&#39;ve gained a bad reputation on the internet. I&#39;m 
going for a different angle, but I don&#39;t know where to go now.&quot;

&quot;Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Uh, I kinda took liberties and made them sorta friends.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay, I like to think of them as ex-lovers or something, even 
though I don&#39;t always ship them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve also been playing Final Fantasy 10 a lot--you know, for notes and 
study. It kinda bugs me that the game never says what happens to Elma 
and Lucile after Macalania.&quot;

&quot;Oh, really? I never noticed.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, I kinda felt lesbian vibes from them when I saw them 
together, so... you know. Then they sorta became my favorite NPC 
characters.&quot;

&quot;Well they were in X2.&quot;

&quot;X2 is a sacrilege. It&#39;s a sin to RPGs everywhere. I swore I wouldn&#39;t 
even rent that game, not even for research on stories. Not even for Elma 
and Lucile!&quot;

&quot;That game&#39;s pretty much lesbianized.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a new word! What else ya got?&quot;

&quot;How bout&#39; this: devirginization. But that one makes sense.&quot;

&quot;The act of... yeah!!&quot; The girls laughed riotously, and poor Usha had no 
idea what was going on. Shipping? Lesbianized? NPC? RPG? They were 
speaking a language unknown to her, or even Ms. Torvald. She cleared her 
throat and tried to clear her confusion, but only one act worked.

&quot;Um, pardon me, but what are you all talking about?&quot; Mira, probably the 
only one out of the entire group who could say she &quot;knew&quot; Usha, was 
polite enough to explain.

&quot;Olivia here is my homework assignment. I have to learn about her, so 
her cousin is here with us to help a bit. I learned that she likes to 
write stories about movies and video games, and also some anime I have 
liked. I&#39;ve seen her work, but I personally do not like it.&quot;

&quot;Only because I can&#39;t help myself,&quot; admitted Ayanna with a blush. Usha&#39;s 
eyes widened.

&quot;...Anime?&quot;

&quot;Japanese animation. Don&#39;t say you&#39;ve never heard of it!&quot;

&quot;I... will not, then,&quot; she concluded, and Mira left it at that. She 
apologized to Usha for carrying on a strange conversation, and asked if 
there was anything she wanted to talk about. &quot;Actually,&quot; she said, her 
voice picking up hope and tempo, &quot;that&#39;s why I came over here. I&#39;d like 
to know what your campaign angle is.&quot;

&quot;My campaign?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you must have some idea. You did nominate yourself for presidency, 
and surely you can&#39;t just expect to rest on popularity to achieve your 
goal!&quot;

&quot;Oh!!&quot; Mira recoiled in shock as she remembered her duty, then groaned 
miserably as of course she had no idea what she was doing. Usha, were it 
possible, looked even worse. And this was her competition?

&quot;It&#39;s... all right,&quot; managed Krishnan in spite of herself. &quot;It&#39;s still 
very early. You have lots of time to think. I&#39;m sure your friends here 
can help...&quot;

&quot;Not us, we&#39;re busy!&quot; The other girls agreed, despite not looking busy. 
Usha sighed.

&quot;Should I...&quot;

&quot;I will think of something!&quot; blurted Mira suddenly. She looked angry and 
upset, as if she sensed that Usha now thought less of her. She even 
snorted and quickly finished her lunch. But soon her anger died, and 
more misery came: &quot;I just... cannot do it now.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;Three words,&quot; she said, holding up her fingers: &quot;South Park marathon!&quot;

If it were in any way possible, Usha would&#39;ve developed a sweat-drop, an 
ellipse, and a face-fault all at once.

&quot;I hope you are not serious.&quot;

&quot;I... wasn&#39;t.&quot; Mira sighed miserably, sinking her head onto the table. 
Her friends watched in pity; her classmates wondered how she could ever 
think of running in the first place. &quot;But you know,&quot; murmured van Dijk 
slowly, rising up once again, &quot;I have to change myself. I want to change 
myself. My grades have been bad for as long as I can remember. If it 
keeps up, I will be punished. My parents will hate me for doing so poor. 
Yusha, I will do my best and try to act more like a president would, and 
I hope you will not have to see me again in such a way. The next time we 
meet, I would like to have answers for you.&quot;

This made Usha smile, of course, and since the lunch break was over, it 
was a good way to part. Everyone said their farewells and left, and Usha 
wished namaste to them all. Her friends had seen the entire thing but 
didn&#39;t bother to interrupt until Krishnan was alone.

&quot;Usha, what was that for? You went and left us to talk to her? You 
didn&#39;t look too happy until just now. What, is she dropping out?&quot;

&quot;No, definitely not,&quot; she replied, smiling brightly. &quot;Mira van Dijk is 
still in the race, and from what I have heard, she will be a rival
