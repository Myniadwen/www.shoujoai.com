<h1>Tokyo Iron Child Akari (part 4 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/ironchild-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;You are my daughter, Kagome Izubata.&quot;

Akari gasped. Kagome was Queen Sagi&#39;s daughter? Through Akari&#39;s chat 
with Queen Sagi, Kagome had remained pretty quiet. Now she had to say 
something, but all of it came from the heart, from the soul. The usually 
calm Kagome poured emotion like raging water down a cliff face.
  
&quot;You can&#39;t be my mother!&quot; Kagome yelled. &quot;If you were, why did you let 
them conduct experiments on me? Why did you put me into battle with 
Akari? Why haven&#39;t you looked after me like a real mother would?&quot;

Queen Sagi shut her eyes. &quot;You deserve to be angry. I will not try to 
explain or justify my actions because there is no justification for 
them. But you must understand how grave our situation is. My brain 
contains a unique form of cell that allows it to interact with 
machinery. In the same way that Akari inherited Asuka&#39;s ability to wear 
the White Orchid Mobile Shell, you have inherited my ability to &#39;speak&#39; 
with machines. I am human. I have weaknesses, one of them being a very 
weak heart. My body is connected to the computers of this building, not 
because of a great yearning to display my power, but because the 
computer system of the AGIST supports my life. Without it, I would 
probably die. Because of this, I can&#39;t leave this room. Would you have 
wanted to spend your childhood locked up in a room with me?&quot; 

Kagome held back her tears. &quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Then you can understand my actions.&quot; Queen Sagi continued. &quot;Any tests 
conducted on me would have killed me in the long run. By having Neganas 
interact with you, Kagome, we hoped that you could probe its mind and 
reveal to us any weaknesses or failings Neganas may possess.&quot;

Akari was furious from hearing that. &quot;And what makes you think you can 
toy with Kagome&#39;s life like that?  She&#39;s not a puppet for you to use!&quot;
 
&quot;What is one human life set against the fate of the world?&quot; Sagi 
retorted. &quot;Better one human suffer than millions suffering along with 
her. If there were any actual risk to her life I would not have put her 
in the experiment. And the reason Kagome was tested against you was 
because my scientists assumed she would have emitted the data for a new 
marionette operating system. They were greatly misguided and I had no 
idea about that issue. They have been punished.&quot;

&quot;And you think that excuses you!?&quot; Akari yelled angrily. &quot;It&#39;s no wonder 
my mom left you! You&#39;re so caught up in defeating Neganas that you&#39;re 
prepared to manipulate anyone around you to do it! Even your own flesh 
and blood! Your daughter!&quot;

Queen Sagi ignored that outburst, focusing on Kagome. &quot;I do love you, 
Kagome. No matter what either of you believes, I do value and think of 
you as my child. It was my dream to raise children with my love, Asuka. 
My desire for a child was never changed.&quot;

Kagome didn&#39;t think about that. &quot;Just... tell me. Why do I have no 
memories of my past?&quot;
                         
&quot;This is because...&quot; Queen Sagi lowered her eyes. &quot;You have been 
cryogenically frozen in stasis for over two years. There is always a 
risk of memory loss when dealing with cryogenics. You see, just like you 
inherited my power to interact with machinery, you inherited my heart 
condition. You lived in Kyoto, in safety; unto I learn that you were 
gaining the same heart problems I have. I ordered them to cryogenically 
freeze you until my doctors could find a way to save your life. Luckily, 
they found a cure from my blood cells. Of course, this cure will only 
work on you.&quot;

Kagome blinked. &quot;You saved my life?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Queen Sagi said. 

&quot;Hey now, Kagome!&quot; Akari said sharply. &quot;You don&#39;t owe her anything! 
Don&#39;t act like she&#39;s made up for everything she&#39;s done to you and my 
mom!&quot;

For the first time, Queen Sagi raised her voice to shouting level. 
&quot;Never doubt my feelings for Asuka!&quot;

Akari looked on. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;I loved her with every part of my being!&quot; Sagi cried desperately. &quot;I 
would have taken a blade to my own throat if she had asked me to! And I 
would damn myself in hellfire for an eternity if I thought it would 
bring her back! You have no idea of what our love was like! You know 
nothing!&quot;

Akari was taken aback by Sagi&#39;s hasty statement. So much so that she 
actually kept quiet. Not that she felt humbled by Queen Sagi, but 
something inside her said that &#39;you&#39;re not the only one hurting&#39;. So 
Akari tried to suppress any anger she felt. 

Queen Sagi cooled herself down also. &quot;I... I am sorry. I should be more 
respectful. It was my company that brought about my love&#39;s end. They 
stole your mother from you, too. That is a debt I can never pay to you. 
But you must know my eternal sorrow. If I had the opportunity to change 
things, I would never have let the animosity between Asuka and myself 
get so bad. But I will make up for it.&quot;

Suddenly, Akari thought of something. &quot;Wait a minute... if you know that 
Asuka Minako is my mom, that means that you know that I&#39;m Tokyo Blossom. 
Why haven&#39;t you said anything to anyone?&quot;

&quot;Out of respect for Asuka&#39;s memory.&quot; Queen Sagi answered. &quot;That&#39;s why I 
re-named the Izubata Company to the Asuka Group three years ago. It&#39;s my 
way of mourning her. I can&#39;t shed any more tears now. Not while I have a 
world to defend.&quot;  

&quot;Do you really see yourself as a defender of a world?&quot; Kagome asked. &quot;I 
am told that dozens of nations are willing to destroy each other right 
now because of the marionette units they have developed from your 
father&#39;s... my grandfather&#39;s work. Even if you do stop Neganas, what 
will you do about that?&quot;

Queen Sagi shook her head. &quot;I have only given humanity the weapons they 
need to defend themselves. How they use that weapon is up to them and 
them alone. I cannot control their destiny I can only foresee it. 
Therefore mankind&#39;s fate is in there own hands, depending on which way 
you see it. Only the human mind is weak enough to fall to the ills of 
greed and power. But only the human heart has the strength to go past 
those weaknesses and seek something worthwhile in the world we live in. 
I believe that the world will see sense one day and learn to abandon the 
weapons they have taken up in anger and ambition. But I can only guide 
the world&#39;s future as best I can, using the power of the Asuka Group. 
The greatest gift I can give you now is defeat over Neganas.&quot;

Sagi looked over at her love&#39;s daughter. &quot;And I need your to help do 
this, Akari.&quot;

&quot;You expect me to help you?&quot; Akari said disbelievingly. &quot;I understand 
you a little better now, but that doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;ve forgotten all this. 
Why should I help you after what you did to my mom? And Kagome for that 
matter?&quot;

&quot;I am asking you to help me stop an evil.&quot; Queen Sagi replied. &quot;I told 
you, I am not trying to atone for my sins. No matter what someone does, 
they can never make up for a sin, no matter how pure they believe 
themselves to be. But I owe it to my dear Asuka to at least end the 
battle with Neganas once and for all. Please just help me do that. When 
Neganas is destroyed, then my life will have ended its usefulness and 
you may do with me as you please.&quot;

Akari sighed, giving a brief smile. &quot;No offence, but it wouldn&#39;t be much 
fun to kill you when you want it done. I guess I&#39;ll just hold off on 
myself. Besides,&quot; She then looked over at the sad and quiet Kagome. &quot;I 
don&#39;t think its up to me to judge you right now.&quot;

&quot;Kagome.&quot; Sagi said, calling to her daughter. &quot;I understand if you hate 
me as well. I have been less than a terrible mother to you. And though 
it may be arrogant and selfish to ask you this, I need your help too. 
Will you aid me in building a better future for mankind?&quot;

Kagome looked away. &quot;I... I need time to think.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Sagi answered. &quot;Feel free to take this time. Now you know the 
truth, there is no need to treat you like a prisoner. You may leave the 
building if you wish, but you would be safer here, now that Neganas is 
on the loose.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll stay...&quot; Kagome said slowly. 

Akari moved closer to Kagome, running her arm around the more timid 
girl&#39;s shoulder. &quot;And I&#39;m staying here with her. Until I&#39;m certain she&#39;s 
okay.&quot;

Queen Sagi nodded. &quot;That is fine. I will tell Shigure to make 
preparations for you. But, before you go, I must tell you about Neganas&#39; 
aim in this life.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Akari asked vacantly.

&quot;Neganas has an uncontrollable longing to bond with artificial tissue 
found in Mobile Shells. I believe this is why it stole the two Mobile 
Shells that you saw, Black Orchid and Chimaera. I fear it is using those 
as temporary bodies for an even greater Mobile Shell.&quot;

&quot;But the remaining two are here, right?&quot; 

Queen Sagi shook her head. &quot;Yes, and no. The six Mobile Shells made in 
the original project are all accounted for. But some of the scientists 
in this company managed to create another... something more dangerous 
that the other six combined. It is called the Garuda.&quot;

&quot;The Garuda?&quot; Akari repeated absently. 

&quot;It is something I really cannot explain to you through a mere 
description. It sleeps inside a place called Hidden Vault, forty metres 
below the surface of Shinjuku. It was used to seal away weapons that we 
felt were too experimental to be used in actual combat just yet. It is 
inside that Vault. And you must do everything to stop Neganas from 
occupying that suit, for in the wrong hands, it could turn Tokyo into a 
smoking pile overnight.&quot;

&quot;Is it that powerful?&quot;

Queen Sagi was horrified by her memory of it. &quot;It is... unstoppable.&quot;

**********

Akari gave a nod of thanks as one of the personal servants handed her a 
cup of coffee. After taking a quick bow, he walked back over to the door 
and exited the room. The young girl was sitting on the bed of quite a 
fancy room, inside of the AGIST. This was the 19th floor, which appeared 
to be a nice little set up of accommodation for some of the people who 
actually lived here. The room was nice. Well-lit, elegant furniture and 
netting against the window overlooking Shinjuku. It had been a few hours 
since her little discussion with Queen Sagi. She still didn&#39;t like any 
of this, least of all staying inside the AGIST when she had fought so 
hard against these people, but she really had no choice in the matter. 
Akari had to stay with Kagome to make sure she would be okay here. 

The other woman was waiting at the window, looking down at the cars and 
people scuttling the streets of Tokyo. It was obvious to anyone that 
Kagome had been shaken up by all the revelations that Queen Sagi had 
revealed. Akari herself had been de-bolted by all the things Sagi had 
spoken of. To know that her mother was in a relationship with that 
woman, and to know that the entire weapon dealing that the Asuka Group 
had been doing was to arm the world in preparation for Neganas. 

Akari hated this. Right now she was so confused. Was she actually going 
to help the Asuka Group? Was she going to fight this &#39;Neganas&#39; for them? 
After all, she had only seen them once and what she did see was pretty 
inconclusive. How exactly was she to know that Neganas had possessed 
those two Mobile Shells, Chimaera and Black Orchid? Akari hadn&#39;t seen 
the pilots; they could have been human for all she knew. For that 
matter, she hadn&#39;t even *seen* this Neganas. For all the Minako-girl 
knew, this was all an elaborate trap. 

Still, no matter what problems she was going through in circumnavigating 
all this, she knew for a fact that no revelation had stunned her to the 
same degree that Kagome had suffered when she learned that Queen Sagi 
was her biological mother. Akari sat on the bed, watching Kagome stare 
out of the window overlooking Shinjuku. There was a haunted look in her 
eyes. As though the fragile, unstable world she had built for herself in 
the past week had been tossed on jagged rocks. And from that world, a 
new one had sprung forth. But this new world wasn&#39;t &#39;new&#39; at all. It had 
been there the whole time, and Kagome was just learning about it now. 
                           
Akari tried not to spill anything when she put down her coffee. 
&quot;Kagome?&quot;
 
Kagome said nothing; she just continued to stare out of the window as 
she had been doing before, her bright green eyes haunted by realization. 
Akari was never going to let this rest though. 

&quot;Kagome...&quot; Akari pleaded. &quot;Please say something. I hate seeing you like 
this.&quot;

&quot;...Why?&quot; She finally said.

Akari blushed lightly. To think the great heartbreaker, the love &#39;um and 
leave &#39;um merchant, Akari Minako, was reduced to a blushing femme. 
&quot;Because I care about you.&quot;
 
&quot;Why should you care for me?&quot; Kagome scolded. &quot;I&#39;m just a puppet after 
all, a tool to be used and then thrown away at the end of my 
usefulness.&quot;

Akari was shocked. Could Kagome really say something like that about 
herself &quot;Of all things to think, why would you think that? You&#39;re not a 
puppet. You&#39;re a wonderful, great girl. I would never see you like 
that.&quot;

&quot;Why not?&quot; Kagome swung her body around, facing Akari. Her eyes were 
dotted with fresh tears, and her petite hands were trembling. 

&quot;My own mother used me in experiments like a guinea pig! I can&#39;t even 
remember where I grew up! How many more times will people try to use 
me?&quot;

&quot;Nobody ever will again.&quot; Akari affirmed severely. 

Kagome seemed to be calming herself, but was still on edge. &quot;How can you 
be so sure of that?&quot;

The white-haired girl did not make an answer to that outright. Instead, 
she stood up, ignoring the coffee that spilled on her bed as a result. 
She simply walked across the red-carpeted room, towards an insecure and 
vulnerable Kagome. Akari stopped as she stood in front of the slightly 
shorter girl, watching her intently. Even when Kagome was this 
distraught, she still didn&#39;t loose that angelic aura of her person. That 
unusual tingling she gave to people by simply being the wonderful person 
that she was, no more, no less. 

Akari extended her arms and drew Kagome&#39;s dainty form into herself, 
wrapping the brunette in a warm, loving and most of all, protective 
embrace. Kagome found herself settling in to this embrace very easily, 
as if the place she belonged really was in Akari&#39;s arms. 

&quot;I&#39;ll never let anyone use you or bring harm to you again, Kagome.&quot; 
Akari said frankly. &quot;I&#39;ll dedicate my life to that desire. If it means 
seeing you smile again, I&#39;ll gladly give my life for it.&quot;

Kagome rubbed a tear from her eye. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t say that. It&#39;s 
unlucky.&quot;

&quot;But it&#39;s true.&quot; Akari said, cradling Kagome&#39;s head in her hand. &quot;That&#39;s 
how I feel, Kagome. That&#39;s what happens when you make me feel like I 
do... right now.&quot;

&quot;How... how do I make you feel?&quot; 

Akari grinned. &quot;Like I could do something stupid.&quot;

Kagome followed that smile with one of her own. &quot;Is that a compliment or 
an insult?&quot;

&quot;A complement.&quot; They both giggled, but Akari became serious when she 
added, &quot;I swear that I will always protect you.&quot;

**********

&quot;This is the door that leads toward Hidden Vault. The path there is 
fairly long, but in your Mobile Shells it shouldn&#39;t take too long to get 
there. We have to close this door till you get back, in case Neganas 
tries to enter through here. Once you get there, do not feel pressured 
into holding back. Any attacks you release will not effect nor be heard 
on the surface. Do your best, and good luck.&quot;

Morning. 

Although Tokyo Blossom really could not tell if it was or it wasn&#39;t. All 
she could see was stone, etched into clumps of dirt in this tiny 
mineshaft-like cave. The elevator back up to the AGIST still looked 
fairly modern though, contrasting the filthy aura of that place. 
Alongside Tokyo Blossom was Omega, his spear in hand; listening fully to 
the instructions one of the Asuka Group soldiers were giving him. 

&quot;I understand.&quot; Omega said austerely. &quot;Until I get back, make sure Queen 
Sagi is protected to the greatest degree we could possibly muster. I 
want to be assured that no harm will come to her while I eliminate 
Neganas.&quot;

The soldier saluted Omega for respect. &quot;Yes sir! We will guard Queen 
Sagi with our lives!&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; Omega turned his gaze at Tokyo Blossom. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

Though Omega could not see it, Tokyo B was glaring hatefully at him. 
&quot;Ready.&quot;

Omega nodded, then ran through the gate to the pathway leading toward 
Hidden Vault. Tokyo B followed after him, and the two were gone. Tokyo B 
took note of the fact that the steel-sealing door closed behind her 
again, but said nothing about it. All she focused on was doing this job. 
The armoured girl looked around at her surroundings. She was surprised 
that this tunnel was so well looked after. There were lamplights every 
three metres, making the path easier to follow. The ground was filthy 
but surprisingly solid, and able to stand up against the sheer weight of 
the Mobile Shells. Aside from the odd prowling rat and some seasoned 
cobwebs, the whole tunnel seemed fairly well maintained. 

It was at that point that Tokyo Blossom turned her attention to the 
armoured man running in front of her. Before she even knew what she was 
doing, she called out to him. 

&quot;How long is this path?&quot; She said whilst running. 

Omega kept running as Tokyo Blossom did, not looking back. &quot;About half a 
mile. The operatives at the Asuka Group make sure to visit and re-visit 
Hidden Vault, to make sure no one enters it other than us. So far we 
have detected no intrusion. If Neganas breaks in, it will be the first 
to do so.&quot;

&quot;Great.&quot; Tokyo B said sarcastically. &quot;So you think you can stop this 
thing from reaching the Garuda before we do?&quot;

&quot;Of course I can.&quot; Omega confirmed sharply. 
 
Tokyo B sneered. She couldn&#39;t stand this guy. &quot;I see. So what&#39;s the deal 
with this Hidden Vault thing? What is its real purpose?&quot;

&quot;To seal away weapons.&quot; Omega said, jumping over a mound of earth. 
&quot;Queen Sagi created Hidden Vault many years ago, to put away weapons 
that she deemed too dangerous to be put into use. Some powerful 
marionettes, laser cannons, biological weapons and atom bombs exist in 
its caverns. But the most dangerous by far is the Garuda Mobile Shell. 
Its power is immeasurable and still unpredictable. But if Queen Sagi&#39;s 
wish is for it to remain buried, then I shall see to it.&quot;  

Tokyo B smiled behind her visor. &quot;Yeah, I gotcha. So what&#39;s the deal 
with you and your queen up in the AGIST? You&#39;re a bit more loyal than 
just another soldier, am I right?&quot;
 
&quot;Like the loyalty you feel toward Kagome?&quot; Omega responded swiftly. 
&quot;Mobile Shell pilots know nothing of isolated, individual power. We were 
given a gift. And the gift must be dedicated to someone else for the 
power to shine through. The power of the suit depends on the level of 
servitude it feels to the wearer, and in turn, the level of dedication 
the wearer has to another person&#39;s life effects that balance.&quot;

&quot;You talk about these Mobile Shells like they&#39;re alive.&quot;
 
&quot;You should be surprised that they aren&#39;t, trust me. That is where my 
strength comes from, from the desire to protect something important to 
me. That is the essence of these suits. Power lies in building 
connections with people and understanding needs in such a way that you 
feel you have accomplished something when their aims and happiness are 
achieved. This is why people always reach new levels of courage and 
vigour when defending friends and family from harm. The mere mortal 
power of gaining strength through protecting those who lack it.&quot;
 
Tokyo Blossom chuckled. &quot;Is that a really pompous away of saying that 
you love Sagi?&quot;
 
&quot;...No.&quot; Omega said with delay. &quot;It&#39;s an arrogant way of saying I&#39;d do 
anything for her. Or at least that&#39;s what you expect me to tell you, 
right?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong,&quot; Tokyo B began. &quot;I respect your dedication, but I 
still think you&#39;re a mindless lackey and a top-rated asshole. But hey, 
no offence.&quot;

&quot;None taken!&quot; Omega said with a laugh. &quot;After all, it&#39;s the job of the 
defeated to be scornful.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom ran faster to move on par with Omega. &quot;I haven&#39;t forgotten 
that you know.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t expect that you have. As I have said, I let you live because I 
enjoyed our match. If you somehow manage to survive the upcoming fight 
with Neganas, then I will be glad to challenge you again.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; The woman said in her stride. &quot;Then it&#39;s agreed. Once we take 
care of this business, we&#39;ll settle our own.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom and Omega continued on, wordlessly. It was an 
uncomfortable situation, considering that they previously had been 
fighting other. Now they were thrust into this shaky partnership. But 
they both had something to protect. Omega had Queen Sagi to think of, 
while Tokyo Blossom had Kagome. While it may not have been a solid 
foundation for a joint venture of this magnitude, having this little 
understanding gave them a half-decent stepping stone toward trust. 

The two Mobile Shell wearers ran down the narrow tunnel, on and on for 
at least twenty minutes, till they reached their destination, deep in 
the dark underbelly of the Tokyo streets. Tokyo Blossom gasped with 
wonder as she stopped herself, and gazed at the mighty, towering doors 
to Hidden Vault. 

Omega stopped too. &quot;We are here.&quot;

Tokyo B was astounded. The tunnel ended a metre back, and then led 
inside this huge cavern, dug deep into the heart of the dirt. The cavern 
was echoing, tall and vast, at least fifty metres high and sixty metres 
wide. But forged into the grim rocks of the chamber were the doors to 
Hidden Vault, two steel doors, wide and thick, long and tall. But her 
awe changed to concern when she saw a burned hole far to the bottom of 
the doors. It was smoking and obviously fresh. There was little air in 
this place for fire to thrive on. 

&quot;Dammit!&quot; Omega cursed. &quot;They have beaten us to the punch. We have to 
keep moving.&quot;

Tokyo Blossom understood that much, and followed after the eager man as 
he dashed into the greatly armoured recesses of Hidden Vault through the 
newly burned hole in its doors. As she entered, Tokyo Blossom was filled 
with even more wonder and curiousness. The inside of Hidden Vault were 
just as large as its entrance, maybe more so. Unlike the outside, Hidden 
Vault was furnished and clean, shining with walls of silver steel and 
stern iron. Weapons were littering the complex like snow on a Hokkaido 
mountain. Tokyo B suddenly felt very small, as much larger items and 
tools surrounded her with their intimidating existences. Advanced 
marionettes, Golems, war cannons, all of them were entombed within 
Hidden Vault. Who knows what kind of damage the Asuka Group could do 
with all that weaponry. Still, it made Tokyo Blossom wonder, why were 
the Asuka Group so afraid of this Neganas thing when it had this kind of 
arsenal waiting in the wings? 

Omega&#39;s attention was on what lay at the end of their path. &quot;There they 
are!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom watched as the two rogue Mobile Shells made their 
appearance before her. The Chimaera and the Black Orchid. Omega readied 
his already withdrawn spear, charging the two in anger. 

&quot;You will pay for the deaths of my men!&quot; He cried. &quot;You will pay!&quot;

While Black Orchid stayed neutral, Chimaera lunged into the air, 
extending its quarterstaff. Omega followed that move in like, hurling 
himself skyward. The two opponents reached each other mid-air and 
slashed, Omega&#39;s spear clashing with Chimaera&#39;s quarterstaff. A loud 
&#39;cling&#39; sound echoed in the weapon-filled chamber, along with the 
beautiful display of exchanged sparks. Both Mobile Shells landed in 
opposite positions, and turned around to face each other. 

Black Orchid watched their altercation, then turned tail and ran toward 
the doorway it was standing in front of. Omega knew it had run, but kept 
his focus on the Chimaera. 

&quot;Tokyo Blossom!&quot; Omega yelled. &quot;Go after the Black Orchid! It is heading 
for the chamber where the Garuda Mobile Shell lies. You must do 
everything you can to stop it from taking over the Garuda!&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot; Tokyo B nodded, and then ran after Black Orchid. &quot;Make sure you 
stay alive so I get my chance against you, Omega!&quot;

Tokyo Blossom left the two, Chimaera and Omega, to battle it out between 
them. From the harsh speed of Omega&#39;s aerial attack, she assumed that he 
had some issues with Chimaera to iron out. No matter. It would make 
dealing with the Black Orchid one-on-one, and so much easier. The 
armoured girl ran after the Neganas possessed machine, watching it dash 
through the new corridor to a new room. Tokyo Blossom followed the 
creature, chasing it down till she entered this room and stopped 
herself.

Tokyo Blossom went still with shock, as her disbelieving eyes and 
contemplating sensors saw the mighty Garuda Mobile Shell, for the first 
time. The girl could not believe what she was seeing. The Garuda was 
enormous. The first thing she noted about the giant colossus was its 
shape. Rather than a battle suit, the Garuda was far, far larger. The 
Garuda stood tall, at least 18.5 metres in height. It had a blunt 
&#39;centaur&#39; shape. A man&#39;s upper torso fixed onto the body of a proud, 
galloping horse. But rather than having a human shaped head, its head 
was alike that of a jaguar, its slashing fangs standing strong along the 
set of its other jagged teeth. At its chest was a Kanji symbol, the 
Kanji for death. Tokyo Blossom&#39;s sensors detected that the Garuda fired 
a Hyper Blast from that part of its body. Its arms were shaped to be 
muscular; the metal had even been moulded to give it this impression. At 
the crown of the Garuda&#39;s skull was a huge mop of hair, that was quite 
biological, the colour of beige. This hair almost touched the back of 
the Garuda&#39;s horse-like rear, the tail hair being of the same colour. 

The human section of the Garuda&#39;s body was built with traditional 
Japanese war armour attached to its shoulders, the kind used in the days 
of the original civil war. It shone with polish, though entombed within 
Hidden Vault; the isolation had done nothing to corrupt its silver 
beauty. 

It was at present, motionless, though Black Orchid seemed to want to 
change all of that with its next move. But Tokyo Blossom knew what it 
wanted to do. The woman withdrew the sword from the sheath on her back, 
and then stood on guard, ready for battle.

Black Orchid looked on, its back was to the Garuda. It appeared to be 
staring at Tokyo Blossom, and the girl could see that little hint of a 
glow behind that visor. Black Orchid bent by the knees, and pulled out 
its sword from the sheath on its back, the sword so similar to that of 
the White Orchid&#39;s. 

&quot;Raaaaah!&quot; Tokyo B yelled out as she began running toward the silent 
Black Orchid, who had already brought up its sword to protect itself. As 
soon as they came close enough to attack each other, Tokyo made a 
vicious slash at the other Mobile Shell, swiping the beast in a 
half-moon form. Black Orchid saw it coming from a mile away and jumped 
skyward, bounding over the assault. It somersaulted numerous times until 
it reached the ground again, just behind Tokyo B. 

Tokyo&#39;s defender swerved and re-attacked the Black Orchid, but rather 
that dodge the slash, it defended, bring up her own sword to block it. 
The echo of two clashing swords boomed around the large room, a wave of 
circular dust being swept up by the wind resistance. While Tokyo Blossom 
struggled to overpower the other in their current sword lock, Black 
Orchid remained cool and calm, expressing no emotion, nor struggle. 
                       
&quot;Damn!&quot; Tokyo Blossom cursed sharply. &quot;I&#39;m not getting any ground here.&quot;

In fact, she was losing it. Tokyo Blossom felt her feet being pushed 
back as Black Orchid pushed forward, pressing even more pressure into 
the grip on her sword. No matter how she tried to force the creature 
back, it proved useless. The Black Orchid was actually stronger than 
her. At first, Tokyo Blossom had believed that the White and Black 
orchids were both the same in performance and power. But she began to 
question this as she was pushed back even further. Then something more 
logical came to mind. 

&quot;This thing isn&#39;t human.&quot; Tokyo B thought. &quot;A machine is obviously going 
to bond better with another machine in this situation. No wonder it&#39;s 
stronger than me.&quot;

Black Orchid made one final push, one that was forceful enough to knock 
Tokyo Blossom out of the sword lock and against the horse-like leg of 
the Garuda. Tokyo B collapsed against it with a thump, the breath 
knocked right out of her. Black Orchid then simply stared at the girl, 
lowering its sword. It then dropped the sword to the ground, bewildering 
Tokyo Blossom. But she was even more surprised when the armour around 
the Neganas began to dissolve. Not by the ST-Link, it simply fell apart, 
piece-by-piece, limb-by-limb, revealing the monster that was at its 
core. 
&quot;What the-?&quot;

Tokyo B looked on as the Black Orchid suit became nothing more than a 
pile of scrap by Femme-Neganas feet, letting the beast show its true 
nature. Tokyo B watched with horror at the thing. She had never seen 
Neganas before, so was unprepared for what it might look like. What it 
looked like, was a perfectly healthy human girl. Clear creamy skin, no 
hint of black or blue. She looked so normal, like any other girl. 
Femme-Neganas stood naked before Tokyo B its long blonde hair flowing 
down to its ankles. Its eyes were free from shame, and glowed with a 
bright blue, right before its lips began moving. 

&quot;You are... human.&quot; Femme-Neganas spoke, but its speech was still like 
an android.

Tokyo Blossom was shocked. She was told that Neganas was appearing to be 
more human, but she never expected this. She would have even made a joke 
about how cute Femme-Neganas looked, but the armoured girl was too 
surprised to bring herself to do so. 

Femme-Neganas continued to speak. &quot;You are known as human. I am a 
machine. I must be a human machine. I am one with your kind.&quot;

&quot;What the hell are you talking about?&quot; Tokyo B spluttered.

&quot;Bargain.&quot; Femme-Neganas babbled. &quot;Bargain made. Minakami. Preparation 
for war. Use as weapon. That is our bargain. Exchange for human life.&quot;

Minakami? That was the only thing she was saying that made sense about 
the last statement. But Tokyo Blossom only knew one Minakami and that 
was Prime Minister Kazuma Minakami, leader of the Japanese government. 
But the Neganas couldn&#39;t be talking about the president, could she?

&quot;Wait.&quot; Tokyo Blossom requested. &quot;Have you made a... bargain with Kazuma 
Minakami?&quot;

Femme-Neganas said no response. Rather six tendrils began to rise from 
its back. Looks like Neganas wasn&#39;t quite the human she appeared to be 
just yet. Tokyo B tried to move out of the way but it was too late. All 
six tentacles grabbed her, two on the arm, two on the legs and one 
around the neck. The final one wrapped itself around the waist of the 
White Orchid. Tokyo B tried to struggle free, but nothing worked. The 
grips of Neganas&#39; tentacles were as tight as solid steel. Femme-Neganas 
began to walk towards Tokyo Blossom, slowly and surely. 

Tokyo B struggled harder than ever, grunting and gasping to get free. 
But it was still no use. It some weird way, Tokyo Blossom lost sense of 
her surroundings. It didn&#39;t feel like the Hidden Vault anymore, it felt 
more like she was fighting to get free in some twisted void. 
Femme-Neganas continued to advance and soon Tokyo B realized she was 
powerless to defend herself. The armour around her body then began to 
vanish, one part at a time. The void grew more wild, colours of black, 
silver and gold swirling around the pair of them. Before she was even 
aware of it, the armour of the White Orchid was completely gone, leaving 
behind a naked Akari to match a naked Femme-Neganas. 

The human machine stopped walking, as she came closest to Akari. Their 
bodies were now pressed together, Neganas&#39; large breasts poking against 
Akari&#39;s smaller ones, their faces separated by a measly two inches. 
Akari was still pinned in place by Femme-Neganas&#39; tendrils, and 
continued to struggle. No matter how hopeless it was. 

Before long, Femme-Neganas spoke again. &quot;You are beautiful. You possess 
the beauty of a human female. I must... be one with female beauty. I 
must be a female of great beauty. A beautiful human. A beautiful female 
human of great beauty... human, human, human, human, human.&quot;

Akari still tried to escape. &quot;Get away from me you psycho freak! Let 
me-&quot; Akari was then silenced as Femme-Neganas pressed their lips 
together, the white-haired girl gasping at their harsh coldness. But she 
was even more alarmed as she felt herself losing consciousness. 

**********

&quot;Uh... oh man... what happened?&quot;

Akari clutched at her head. It felt like it was banging inside. Slowly 
she ambled upward, thankful that Femme-Neganas was nowhere in sight. But 
where was Akari? The young woman looked around herself. This was not 
Hidden Vault, no cold weapons around for miles. Rather, she was at a 
rather different place that she had previously been. The whole area was 
covered in miles and miles of lowly cut green grass, a gentle breeze 
swaying through them so serenely. Up in the sky was nothing but pure 
beautiful blue, not a cloud in sight. 

Though it was slightly chilly. Akari continued to look around, shivering 
a bit from the coldness of the breeze that had been passing through this 
&#39;valley&#39; if it could be classified as such. Then, suddenly, a small ball 
of energy appeared right before Akari. She stared at it with fright, but 
even more so when it began to materialize into a form she knew all too 
well. 

A tall woman with long, bright blonde hair, someone very relevant to 
Akari&#39;s past...

The young woman couldn&#39;t believe her eyes. &quot;Mom?&quot;

Asuka Minako (or something that appeared to be her) materialized before 
the fruits of her womanhood. The older woman carried a warm, motherly 
smile on her face, though Akari could see that slight twinge of sadness 
in her haunting blue eyes. Though Akari had no idea of what was going 
on, she could not mistake the safety she felt from observing her mother 
like this. Though she had died three years ago, Akari had never lost 
that loving bond she carried in her heart. 

&quot;Mom?&quot; Akari spoke quietly. &quot;Is that really you?&quot;

Asuka shook her head. &quot;No. I am sorry, Akari Minako. I am not your 
mother. I am mental projection of the mother you carry in your memories. 
Tetsuko thought it might be easier to talk to you like this.&quot;

&quot;Tetsuko?&quot; Akari questioned. &quot;Who the heck is that?&quot;

&quot;It is the name Female Neganas has given to herself.&quot;

&quot;Neganas?&quot; Akari suddenly remembered everything. &quot;I have to get out of 
here! I&#39;ve got to stop that thing before it merges with the Garuda 
Mobile Shell!&quot;

Asuka shook her head once more. &quot;You cannot stop Tetsuko from here. She 
has brought you into her mind so that you may see this from her 
perspective. She believes that if you understand her reasoning, you will 
show no more resistance.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need to know anything!&quot; Akari yelled aloud. &quot;That thing&#39;s crazy 
and it needs to be destroyed!&quot; 

&quot;You should think more with your heart and less with you head, Akari. 
Tetsuko is no threat to anyone. Just like Kagome was manipulated by the 
Asuka Group, Tetsuko and her brother, Tetsuken, are being manipulated by 
the Japanese Government.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Asuka continued to ease Akari&#39;s confusion. &quot;Tetsuko and Tetsuken were 
originally one being called Neganas. Neganas was being used by the 
Japanese Government in preparation for the war with the United States. 
By starting war with Korea, President Minakami managed to obtain the 
data needed for the nano-machine weapon. But what he didn&#39;t plan on was 
Neganas developing its own mind and soul.&quot;

&quot;Soul?&quot; Akari said disbelievingly. &quot;A machine can&#39;t have a soul.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so sure of that. Religion defines a soul as an intangible 
presence that transcends the physical body. Philosophy defines a soul as 
a collection of all the attributes, positive and negative, that makes up 
who we are and how we see the world. When something is given a body to 
accomplish things and mind with which we think things through, that 
being is bound to develop its own perspective and views on the world it 
lives in. These ideals then become ingrained in its mind, but take a 
deeper significance that will eventually affect the way the mind thinks. 
These ideals go beyond the mind and body. These are the ideals of the 
soul.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; Akari said. &quot;What are you trying to tell me?&quot;

&quot;While in captivity, Neganas developed its own soul. I know it may seem 
radical for you to believe, because to you, machines are simply tools, 
which you use to make your life easier. But Neganas does not see itself 
as a means to an end. It sees itself as a prisoner to the will of an 
enslaver.&quot;

Akari blinked. &quot;Enslaver? You mean... President Minakami?&quot;

&quot;Correct. The will of Neganas made it seek to defend itself against 
people like Kazuma Minakami. So when the Asuka Group stole Neganas from 
the government research team and made their own experiments, Neganas 
lashed out in the only way it could, through violence. Though it is 
becoming more and more humane, through torture and experimentation it 
has experienced, it can no longer distinguish between friend and foe. 
That is one of the reasons it wants to take over the Garuda Mobile 
Shell. It is the only weapon it feels it can protect itself with.&quot;

&quot;One reason? What&#39;s else is there?&quot;

&quot;The artificial tissue found in Mobile Shells reacts very well with 
Neganas. It is why Tetsuko appeared to be so human when she abandoned 
the Black Orchid. But this process is reversible and Tetsuko will return 
to her purely Neganas-form. So she and her brother seek the Garuda 
because merging with it will complete the transformation from 
nano-machine to human.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll be... a human being?&quot; Akari asked, astonished. 
  
&quot;Yes.&quot; Asuka said. &quot;But, she does not know how uncontrollable the Garuda 
is. The Garuda is programmed with something called a self-defence 
program. This means that it will protect itself to the bitter end, 
without qualm or concern. But because the Asuka Group could not create a 
counter program to override that command, the Garuda goes into 
self-defence automatically. When it is activated, the Garuda will 
destroy anything that it comes close to. And I fear that Tetsuko will 
not be able to control the Garuda until she becomes fully human.&quot;

&quot;How long will that take?&quot;

&quot;Three months.&quot; Asuka answered. &quot;If she stays inside the Garuda for that 
long, she will be human, and have the knowledge to control Garuda. But 
the violence it will wreak in that time is immeasurable.&quot;
 
&quot;Man,&quot; Akari said, rubbing her arms. &quot;What am I even fighting for?&quot;

&quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Asuka asked.

Akari just lowered her eyes to the grassy ground. &quot;I&#39;ve been battling 
the Asuka Group for over three years now. Then just yesterday I learned 
that Queen Sagi hasn&#39;t been preparing for war at all. She was preparing 
for Neganas. Then now I realized that this Neganas thing is only a 
threat because people keep trying to abuse its power. Everyone is so 
suspicious of each other. The government of America, my mother of Queen 
Sagi, Queen Sagi of Neganas, and Neganas of people. What&#39;s the point of 
it all? Why should I fight for any of it when I can&#39;t even tell who my 
enemies are?&quot;

Asuka rested a hand on Akari&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I understand your confusion. 
After the death of your mother, you were given a task planned in 
blindness and a responsibility that you could not escape. But you have 
been following the will of others simply because they tell you things. 
Though you appear to be and act like a free spirit, you are still a 
young woman, with a life robbed from you.&quot;

Akari looked away. &quot;Are you saying I&#39;m insecure or something? A 
psychology teacher said the exact same thing to me. He said it explained 
why I&#39;m always so &#39;abrasive&#39; to people. Just a cover for my weakness.&quot;

&quot;Weakness is a human trait.&quot; Akari said. &quot;It&#39;s why Tetsuko and Tetsuken 
envy and love human life so much. Imperfections make life wonderful to 
live for. It brings difference and diversity, and is why humans and 
machinery are so caught up in this war we find. Humanity is jealous of 
the immortality and perfection a machine has and machines are resentful 
of the transience and impurity that humanity carries. That rivalry 
between an everlasting life and an enjoyable one, is what makes this 
situation so blurred. But you should not need to worry about that, 
Akari. The only thing you need to think about is what feels right for 
you and the power you hold. There is no right or wrong in this 
situation, only the choice about how you should live your life and how 
you should use the power given to you. What is your choice?&quot; 

Akari decided. &quot;I have to fight. To protect Kagome and Ryoko. I don&#39;t 
care about mom&#39;s vendetta with Queen Sagi anymore. Or about what Neganas 
wants out of life. Or even the debt that Queen Sagi feels she owes to my 
mom. I have to protect what I love most. My friends. And I have to stop 
Tetsuko to do it.&quot;

Asuka nodded. &quot;I see. So that is your choice? Then so be it. Tetsuko 
understands what you must do, but she will not stop herself from bonding 
with the Garuda. It&#39;s up to you to decide that course of your own 
destiny now.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, but...&quot; Akari looked up. &quot;If you&#39;re not my mom, or Tetsuko 
herself, who are you?&quot;

Asuka (or her replica) shook her head. &quot;I cannot tell you that. I myself 
don&#39;t completely understand my existence. All I am is guide. How you and 
Tetsuko choose to perceive my words is not in my control.&quot;

&quot;I gotcha.&quot; Akari agreed with a grin. &quot;I guess I&#39;m gonna meet my fate, 
huh?&quot;

**********

Femme-Neganas broke off the grasp her tendrils had around Tokyo 
Blossom&#39;s body. Tokyo B stepped back, slightly dazed from the contact, 
though her armour was fully operational now. Rather than make a new 
fight she undoubtedly would lose, Femme-Neganas withdrew her tentacles. 
They slithered back into her human-like body, and then she vaulted into 
the air, toward the Garuda. She bounced from its leg to its back, and 
then up to its head. Femme-Neganas then reduced herself to her jelly, 
blob-like form, and slid inside the Garuda from the mouth-inwards. 

By the time Tokyo Blossom awoke from her daze, it was too late. The red 
eyes in the Garuda&#39;s silver skull brightened with passion, as the 
Femme-Neganas sought its hibernation inside the machine, the microscopic 
machines in its body merging, absorbing and becoming the tissue found 
inside its bowls. 

&quot;Damn.&quot; Tokyo B said, grabbing her sword. &quot;I was too late to stop 
Tetsuko.&quot;

&quot;RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHH!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; The Garuda unleashed a hideous 
screech as it entered its automatic self-defence program, and began 
moving, like a wild animal. The hooves of its horseshoes smashed into 
the stone platform it was standing on, while its arms waved and thrashed 
in the air, breaking the stalactites hanging above the rocky ceiling. 
Tokyo Blossom backed up as this happened, but was again knocked 
senseless, as a rock smacked the skull of her Mobile Shell from above. 
Tokyo B passed out, falling to the ground, while Garuda continued its 
rage.

The breastplate of the beast suddenly opened, and it leaned back to aim 
upwards. A huge blast of searing energy, the Garuda&#39;s Hyper Blast, 
surged up from its chest and burned straight through the ceiling of rock 
and metal. A few seconds later, this beam re-appeared on the surface of 
a busy Shinjuku street, blowing up the road and pavement. Amid the 
screams and cries of the surrounding community, a figure flashed up from 
the massive 17metre hole that the beam had created. That creature was 
the Garuda. 

As ordinary people gasped in fear of it, they were unaware of the 
destruction it was going to cause to the city. They were unaware of how 
little of their lives they had left to enjoy.
