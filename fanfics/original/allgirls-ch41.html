Hitomi Madsen had just gotten over her fling with Lilian when her friend 
and fellow teacher Abby Keeping asked her for dinner. Hitomi had made 
many friends during her two-year career as a Literature and Writing 
teacher at Stanton, but none were closer than Abby, none more supportive 
and loving, none (frankly) nearer to her in age, or passion, or 
strength. Going out with her to dinner, whether to a hole or a swank, 
would&#39;ve been as natural and enjoyable as a walk in the spring, so she 
said yes and, after school, put on her best.

Abigail Marie Keeping (her full name, but she preferred &quot;Abby&quot;) was a 
Romanian beauty, a Libra, and a psychology teacher who loved her 
students and often acted as a councilor to them. Keeping faintly 
resembled her friend, in that their size was about the same, and they 
both had very long, rich black hair, though Hitomi wore hers braided 
since it reached her waist, and Abby kept it up since hers was a little 
shorter. Her eyes were emeralds, precious and green as the blood of 
grass; she had long legs, long fingers, and long lashes; her kind face 
and full pink lips would&#39;ve floored anyone.

Upon the night of their dinner&#151;Abby wanted it to be a date, but she 
didn&#39;t want to pressure her friend&#151;she wore a favorite green turtleneck 
sweater, a black skirt that went to her knee, and black heels instead of 
the sandals she liked. Her hair was braded by pearl hairpins, her face 
touched with makeup, her teeth brushed and brushed again, nearly to 
madness. She had been meticulous when it came to shaving, though it was 
probably foolish of her to pay extra attention to areas she would never 
show, nor would Hitomi ever see. Her indecisiveness came in and the 
razors came out, though.

She was ready, perfumed, and prepared thirty minutes ahead of schedule. 
Hitomi volunteered to drive, so she waited on her couch like a silly 
girl before the big date. Inhale, tick, exhale, tick. The clock and her 
lungs were in synch. Inhale, tick, blink, exhale, tick, blink. Fidget. 
Sigh. She was tempted to pick up a book, but she knew the moment she got 
into it, Madsen would be there. She waited and bit down on her lower 
lip. Tick, tick, inhale, tick, blink, tick, exhale. She smoothed out her 
dress and, out of bad habit, cracked her knuckles. She checked for the 
thousandth time that everything was perfect, her nails and fingers 
presentable, her makeup on right, her perfume subtle enough. She counted 
the money in her purse for the tenth time and still came up with $42, 
enough for both of them should Hitomi forget hers.

She grinned and jerked out of her seat (ala girl on date) as she heard a 
car pull up to her driveway, park, and open and shut a door. She tried 
not to appear nervous or ecstatic as she heard the clop-clop of heels on 
her porch, and restrained herself from prematurely opening the door. She 
waited three seconds after the doorbell rang to open up and welcome her 
friend.

&quot;Hi! Good to see you. You&#39;re early.&quot;

&quot;Yes. I make it a habit of mine. Are you ready?&quot;

&quot;Um, yes. Shall we?&quot; Hitomi smiled and went on ahead; Abby stayed behind 
to lock up, and got into the passenger seat of her friend&#39;s car. The 
local techno station was playing on her radio.

&quot;You said you liked this music, so I...&quot; Abby grinned.

&quot;You remembered! You&#39;re so sweet.&quot;

&quot;Thank you. Elise&#39;s, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Hitomi backed out of the driveway and, turning this way and that, 
drove to the restaurant called Elise&#39;s, where they had agreed to go for 
the &quot;date&quot;.

Thirty minutes into the appetizer, and already they were laughing like 
old (or older) friends. They each had a bowl of soup according to their 
taste, and awaited the generous sandwiches and vegetable sides 
patiently. The conversation literally went everywhere, from how they 
were both doing to what their deepest fear was, including romances and 
relationships. Abby did not have too many stories to relate.

&quot;A man I was dating in college was the closest I came to being a 
Missus,&quot; she said humbly, stirring her soup. &quot;God, I was so in love... 
it&#39;s hard to believe it was nearly... six years ago. I thought I was 
going to be Mrs. Abigail Carter, but... I was wrong.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot; Keeping sighed deeply, as if the years had already dug 
in great holes.

&quot;He came out of the closet on me, two years after we met. He said he was 
doing the honest thing, and although I was crushed back then, right now 
I can understand him. We still keep in contact, you know; I was at his 
wedding.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s married?&quot; Abby hummed as she drank her lemonade.

&quot;Mm. To a nice man. Not legally, of course, but close enough. I like 
him. I&#39;m happy. It took a long time, of course, but I got over it. We&#39;re 
still good friends. He keeps on joking to me that his &#39;gay side&#39;, or 
whatever he calls it, has rubbed off, and soon I&#39;ll be swept away by a 
fair princess.&quot; Madsen chuckled and hoisted her coffee to her lips.

&quot;Will you?&quot;

&quot;I may yet,&quot; she said wryly. &quot;I haven&#39;t dismissed the possibility. I 
tried it once, when I got out of college. It was okay, but it didn&#39;t 
really go anywhere. It&#39;s possible I&#39;m bisexual, but either way, I 
haven&#39;t met the right one, or even the near-right one. What about you?&quot;

&quot;Mm, I&#39;m bisexual,&quot; said Madsen casually. She had never told her friend 
before, but since the conversation was gravitating towards it, what 
better time? Keeping looked surprised, even impressed.

&quot;Well, I didn&#39;t expect that.&quot; Madsen gave her friend a bitter smile.

&quot;Neither did my parents.&quot; She mutely stirred her coffee while Keeping 
pondered over this. She leaned forward a fraction, her face concerned.

&quot;How did they take it?&quot;

&quot;Very... poorly. I can still hear them yelling at me, though it was a 
long time ago. They disowned me, and practically kicked me out of the 
house that very night.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no... oh, Hitomi, I&#39;m so sorry...&quot; Keeping took her friend&#39;s hand 
and squeezed it supportively, but Madsen&#39;s grin told her that it was all 
right.

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s okay. Like I said, it was a long time ago. And I know I&#39;m not 
a lesbian because I entered into a perfectly healthy relationship with 
an older man during college. Of course, it didn&#39;t stay that way; it 
ended rather sourly. You could say I&#39;m poor at relationships.&quot; Abby gave 
her friend a sad, strong, and supportive stare all at once, and rubbed 
her hands tenderly.

&quot;We&#39;ve both had back luck. But at least we have each other because of 
it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, a pleasure. One of the great parts of my life.&quot; She grinned and 
hid her lower face with her coffee mug, taking a big sip. Keeping 
blushed and smiled humbly.

&quot;Mine too. Hitomi... may I tell you something now, right now, and have 
your word that you won&#39;t... completely hate me for it, or think I&#39;m 
strange?&quot;

&quot;Well, I can&#39;t promise anything, but I&#39;ll do my best. What is it?&quot; Abby 
was silent for awhile, for affect and to gather her nerve as well. She 
wanted to tell Hitomi that she was attracted to her, and to be honest, 
she had wanted to tell her since their very first encounter, over two 
years ago when they met and forged a friendship. It was actually because 
of their friendship that made Abby so uncertain&#151;that, and she was 
cautious about relationships with other teachers. Something told her she 
would regret it if she did say anything, while something else said she&#39;d 
regret it if she didn&#39;t.

Damned if she did, damned if she didn&#39;t.

To Hell with damnation, she decided. Better if Hitomi knew than let it 
sting her insides forever.

&quot;I,&quot; she breathed, still nervous as she worded herself carefully, &quot;am 
very attracted to you, Hitomi, and I would like to know if you&#39;d be 
interested in a... romantic relationship with me. If you&#39;re not... 
please be gentle with me, and know that... either way, I like you and I 
want you to be my friend.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Hitomi&#39;s first reaction was unexpected; her face widened in 
surprise and she stopped stirring her coffee. She deliberated. As the 
silence was shared between them, their meal arrived and with a pale 
&quot;thank you&quot;, they were alone again. Hitomi cleared her throat and knew 
it&#39;d be rude if she ate without answering, so she did was she thought 
was best.

Smiled.

Broadly.

And squeezed Abby&#39;s hand.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask, dear,&quot; she whispered. Abby visibly lightened 
with relief and sighed, feeling the yoke of uncertainty shake off her 
shoulders. She laughed with happiness and held Hitomi&#39;s hand, making a 
sandwich of skin and fingers.

&quot;Oh, whew! Wow, for a second there... whew! Hitomi...&quot; she swallowed, 
&quot;you really know how to worry somebody!&quot;

&quot;What, you were worried?&quot;

&quot;A little,&quot; she admitted sheepishly, putting her finger and thumb close 
together as an indication. &quot;I was actually scared that you&#39;d say no and 
distance yourself from me. I would&#39;ve been able to handle a no, just 
not... the total rejection.&quot;

&quot;Abby... Abby...&quot; Hitomi smiled warmly and slid her hand from her 
friend&#39;s fingers up her arm, over her shivering neck, and to her cheek, 
where it stayed nestled comfortably. &quot;You never had anything to worry 
about, dear. I must admit, I had a little crush on you ever since you 
came down from heaven and saved me, and I&#39;ve liked you more and more 
ever since. I&#39;m actually a little sad that you never told me this 
before.&quot;

&quot;Oh, boy.&quot; Abby groaned sadly and rolled her eyes. &quot;Now you tell me!&quot;

Their simultaneous laughter was more beautiful than music.

&quot;So...&quot; said Hitomi unsurely, &quot;are we, like, girlfriends, or what?&quot;

&quot;Girlfriends, I guess. I mean, romantically, not friend-wise. I mean, 
friend-wise, but also romantically.&quot; They laughed again, Hitomi saying 
&quot;We both know what we mean&quot;, and finally at last, sealed their new 
relationship and yes, dined. The food was good; their revelation was 
better. Abby paid for dessert, thus making them &quot;even&quot;, and after asking 
for a take-out box, they left Elise&#39;s with a generous tip and drove back 
to Abby Keeping&#39;s small house. Their romance would end like a normal 
date, with one dropping the other off, promising to &quot;do it again 
sometime soon&quot;.

Well, &quot;normal&quot; was such a boring word, and it did no justice to their 
relationship.

.........

The words &quot;Would you like to come in for a drink?&quot; drew joy from 
Hitomi&#39;s depths, and she grinned and accepted the invite. She honestly 
did not want to go home anyway, not yet, not if she had an alternative, 
so she locked her car and followed her friend&#151;her new girlfriend&#151;into 
her humble house. Madsen, having an apartment, commented on how lovely 
it was as the lights came on.

&quot;Something hard or soft?&quot; asked Abby, hunting through her refrigerator. 
Hitomi couldn&#39;t help staring at her protruding behind as she bent over, 
and resisted the urge to trot over and touch it (and the words &quot;hard&quot; 
and &quot;soft&quot; did not help at all). She cleared her throat and asked if 
Abby had any Bacardi, which she did. The two clinked glasses, toasting 
their new relationship, and sipped.

&quot;Good!&quot; gasped Hitomi. Abby chuckled and agreed.

&quot;Some TV?&quot; she offered, walking gracefully to her small lounge room.

&quot;No, I rarely watch it, except for special events. I hate sitcoms, and 
the news is nothing but violence these days. What music do you have?&quot;

&quot;More than techno,&quot; she jested. She chuckled to ensure Hitomi wasn&#39;t 
hurt in any way, and pulled out some soft piano concertos she loved. 
Hitomi said &quot;Aah, Rachmaninov!&quot;, and settled into her friend&#39;s--her 
girlfriend&#39;s couch, drink in hand, along with Abby herself. They shared 
a warm laugh and put their arms around each other. It was the Second 
Concerto, something Hitomi loved greatly (ah, if only I had brought my 
Wagner, she thought). After that came the Rhapsody on a Theme of 
Paganini (Variation 18), and many others. Hitomi found herself warm from 
Abby&#39;s body heat, her senses sharp from her touch, her smell, the sound 
she made when sighing or saying little comments.

&quot;Who do you like?&quot;

&quot;Wagner. And Tchaikovsky. Especially Swan Lake and Tannhauser.&quot;

&quot;You ever seen them? I&#39;ve been to a few concerts.&quot;

&quot;I saw Swan Lake when I was little. It&#39;s one of the few memories I still 
recollect vividly. I&#39;ve been aching to see a Wagner opera, any of them, 
but they never seem to play, and I don&#39;t even know where to get 
tickets.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s an opera house downtown. I&#39;m sure if you call them you can find 
out.&quot; Hitomi smiled, and clasped her hand into Abby&#39;s, feeling the 
tingling rush of electric harmony.

&quot;Maybe I can treat you to a night at the opera in the future.&quot;

&quot;Would you? Oh, I&#39;d love that! I have a dress I&#39;ve been meaning to wear 
to something like that! Maybe I could... model it for you.&quot;

&quot;Nnhh. Not now. This moment is beautiful on its own.&quot; Abby agreed with a 
moan of contentment and cuddled closer to Hitomi as a more romantic 
concerto began. Her head nestled against Madsen&#39;s shoulder, breathing in 
her delicious scent, feeling nothing but happiness now that she was 
truly with the woman she loved, the one she had loved for a long time. 
It was like a dream, vivid and sweet, drenched with senses and fresh 
eroticism, like lovemaking but in a sense, better.

She smiled when Hitomi curled her fingers around her hair and played 
with it. She easily loosened braids and pins that had taken hard work to 
put up, combing Abby&#39;s rich raven-wing hair until it was as free and 
loose as the night. Abby looked up into the younger woman&#39;s face and 
smiled with all the love she had borne Madsen since first meeting her, 
and could hold back no longer. She crawled forth and drew a slow, 
desperate kiss, and held it for as long as it took her own hands to 
loosen Hitomi&#39;s hair, and play with it tenderly.

When they released, Hitomi looked so euphoric, so entranced with the 
wonderful sweetness of love&#151;true, real, good love, made just for her it 
seemed&#151;Abby could not restrain herself and dove in for a more passionate 
embrace of the mouths, grabbing her friend and rising so they were 
evenly met. She kissed, spread her lips, puckered them planted them 
everywhere, sometimes keeping them still so long that she could actually 
drink in Hitomi&#39;s wetness; she tasted Hitomi through her suckling 
kisses.

Desperately she trailed across Madsen&#39;s jaw, leaving a moist line where 
her mouth had lain, ears vibrating from the soft cries of her girlfriend 
lost in rapture. Abby surrendered to Hitomi&#39;s wandering fingers as they 
clawed her hair, scratched deeply, sending waves of pleasure and 
ticklish glee right through her spine; she leaned back and held Madsen 
close as they merged, as she kissed and breathed on her neck; she 
giggled from the tickle of her breath.

Abby gave a guttural groan and shivered as Hitomi&#39;s tongue dragged its 
full pink body up the center of her neck, gliding roughly up her throat 
to her chin, and ended in a curl. Hitomi kissed the same chin, then 
protruded her tongue again but licked low this time, taking pleasure in 
the taste of Abby; she went as far down to nearly frighten her 
girlfriend as her tongue poked with gentle care the vulnerable area 
between throat and chest, a depression for which the slightest touch 
gave heaven, where the slightest touch bordered on absolute trust and 
slight doubt; the area where senses were lost and where Abby dared not 
even whisper. Hitomi only touched the tip of her tongue there, and 
kissed it twice, before locking fingers with her love&#39;s hands.

Abby leaned her head to the side and moaned as she felt hot breath on 
her right ear. Hitomi was nuzzling her nose in that area, pushing up 
like a puppy, sometimes extending her tongue out to lick the lobe, or to 
wiggle it, or to suck on it and hear groans&#151;&quot;Oh, Hitomi...&quot; She stabbed 
Abby&#39;s earlobe with passionate violence, digging her tongue in deep (oh 
how thankful Abby was that she had waxed them twice!), feeling every 
sensual curve and sexy valley; she whispered &quot;Lust&quot;, hissing every 
letter out in painful sweetness as her tongue curled on the &quot;L&quot; and 
lashed out on the &quot;T&quot;. Abby could only breathe intensely, wishing so 
hard to have Hitomi to herself, to return the favor and more.

Hitomi dragged her mouth over and sucked on Abby&#39;s lips greedily, 
spreading her arms to the sky with Abby&#39;s along. She whispered 
seductively, &quot;Keep them there, lover,&quot; and with nimble fingers, tickled 
Abby&#39;s hips before she tucked underneath her sweater and lifted it up. 
Beneath it was a white undershirt; Hitomi let out a sexy squeal, locked 
lips with Abby, and took the shirt off her girlfriend like a peel from a 
banana. As she lifted the cotton off, her fingers became entwined once 
again with Abby&#39;s. Their eyes met in lustful clarity; Abby knew what she 
needed to do.

They continued their lover&#39;s stare as she unbuttoned Hitomi&#39;s blouse, 
her fingers slightly nervous and jittery. Hitomi chuckled as they 
tickled her, or squealed as they &quot;accidentally&quot; slipped around her 
bosom, but kept her arms stretched out until Abby saw it fit to dispose 
of the garment. It took very little time for the women to dispose of 
their formalities, so to speak; they struggled to remove their skirts as 
they smothered each other with arms, skin, lips, bodies, everything.

There was no longer any sense in their wild thrashing. They were nude 
save for their sensual undergarments, one pair red and the other white; 
brassieres of delicate make hid their bosoms; ample thongs kept their 
waists covered; garters and hosiery hid their legs. Abby, now fully in 
charge and too wild to consider anything else, was straddling Hitomi by 
her legs as she purred and ran her drumming fingers up and down her 
lover&#39;s naked skin. Hitomi had her hands stretched out and was laying on 
the couch, expressing absolute excitement at the rush of her lover, her 
friend, on top of her and ready to go all-out.

Hitomi moaned as Abby&#39;s hands grazed past her bra; she squealed with 
feminine pleasure as Abby&#39;s undergarments came in contact with her own, 
wet silk against wet silk; she panted and nearly barked when Keeping 
descended and pried her mouth open with her tongue, reaching deep inside 
so both could embrace each other. She snapped playfully when her love 
came up, and cackled with lustful glee when Abby rocked her hips back 
and forth, her bottom swaying seductively, her arms entwined with 
Hitomi&#39;s.

Her tongue traced her lips slowly and deliberately, tasting them with 
careful cruelty. Hitomi puckered in hopes of adding more; Abby folded 
her fingers over Madsen&#39;s mouth and kissed her from behind them; Madsen 
drew her long digits into her mouth and suckled them. She offered her 
own salty fingers, and together each woman wrapped their tongues around 
each other; their mouths soon met, lips and tongues and fingers mashed 
together. Abby kissed the strap of Hitomi&#39;s bra wildly, and since her 
back was exposed, Hitomi now had a golden opportunity to undress her 
love.

They sat up for the official ceremony. They entwined their legs around 
each other&#39;s waists and fondled the straps, until the confusion of hooks 
and fingers became undone, and their chests were freed. They each tossed 
aside the delicacies &quot;for later&quot;, and took a moment to admire each 
other&#39;s naked breasts. Their every breath caused the circular flesh to 
rise, fall, and rise again in hypnotism; the twin nipples gazed back 
like lustful eyes. Both women reached for the breasts at the same time 
and took them&#151;groaned&#151;and caressed them softly. Madsen moaned. Abby was 
grazing; her hands were sending wave of pleasure, ticklish and erotic, 
barely touching; the surprise of touch and warmth was more ecstatic than 
the feelings themselves.

Hitomi traced circles around Abby&#39;s cute dark-pink nipples, herself 
moaning as her love pinched hers. They stood taut as pyramids, so she 
poked them in hopes of quieting their lust, but this only caused Abby to 
squeal more. Hitomi giggled and gave her love a thrill by calling her 
name out desperately, but with good reason: Keeping had enveloped part 
of her breast in her mouth.

Hitomi propped herself up on her arms and continued moaning as if she 
were in a porn movie (albeit the most wonderful one ever made). With 
Abby&#39;s legs embracing her waist, her hair fallen to her chest, her lips 
around her skin and her body heat rising, she had no choice but to 
relent. She cried sweetly as Abby bit into the flesh of her breast, and 
wailed quite softly as her love dug her face into her cleavage, then 
came out to smother the remaining breast in love. Hitomi squealed and 
challenged gravity by freeing one arm to caress her lover&#39;s hair.

Three things finally occurred to her as she sat there in rapture.

One, all this was happening to her on the first date.

Two, her panties were still on.

Three, the music had stopped.

Bother.

She forced Abby down on the couch with a growl, pinning her hands to the 
soft cushions as her wild black hair fell down, covering her lover&#39;s 
face and chest. Abby tried puffing some of it away, but between laughs, 
she could only blow a little away. Hitomi swept her hair aside, beamed 
down at her with total love, and traced her jaw from one ear to the 
other. Abby sighed happily.

&quot;Hitomi...&quot; Hitomi grinned as she released her lover&#39;s hands, dove in, 
and smothered her lips. Their tongues burrowed deep into each other&#39;s 
warm mouths, meeting for their own little tryst inside; they danced 
against teeth and gums, over the roof and underneath each other. Hitomi 
gave a muffled moan as she felt Abby&#39;s hands rub against her bottom, the 
only part of her not naked. She relented the deep kiss and laughed.

&quot;Those do come off, Abby-dear,&quot; she said. Abby grinned, too happy to 
speak, and pried them loose. Madsen wiggled her bottom and got to her 
knees, trying to help her lover in spite of both hands now being 
occupied (Abby was sucking on her fingers). Her legs splayed everywhere 
as she fought to remove her underwear, and with a final thrust, Hitomi 
Madsen was naked for her lover. In the dark of Abby&#39;s lounge, the small 
bit of pubic hair she kept showed up well on her skin. Abby gasped, even 
though she couldn&#39;t get a proper look.

&quot;Oh my.&quot;

&quot;Your turn,&quot; purred Hitomi. Abby giggled as Hitomi dove in to yank her 
underwear off, and with some struggle (aided when Madsen lifted both her 
legs up, getting an extremely good view), the last of their clothes met 
the floor and stayed there for a long time. Hitomi remained where she 
was, poised over her lover, nude and nervous and too happy to speak.

She squeezed Abby&#39;s toes. Abby squealed. Her vagina, naked save for a 
small patch of womanly fur, awaited her. Hitomi wanted to do a trillion 
things at once, so it took great restraint to fold herself onto her 
lover, body merging against body, fingers entwining and eyes meeting; 
the souls themselves locked arms and made love, and squeals too soft and 
beautiful to hear came from both women.

Abby was freed so she could peek at every part of Hitomi. She took her 
time in staring, and did not touch until she was ready. She had Hitomi 
sit up straight on the couch, back against the armrest, and climbed on 
top so she was sitting on her lap. Hitomi drew her lover in, feeling 
every part of her naked body merge into hers, and hissed sharply from 
the unbelievable rush. There was only Abby in the world; confound the CD 
player, confound the lights, confound the next day and their duties! 
There was only Abby to her; nothing else would ever really exist again.

She leaned her head back, letting her hair fall. Abby placed her hands 
on the younger woman&#39;s shoulders, and drew in for a long, deep kiss, 
where mouth met mouth and tongue met tongue, and where their naked 
breasts squeezed against each other blissfully; nipple teasing against 
nipple, flesh locking into flesh; passionate hands drew close until they 
were very nearly one person, and they began to moan as their hands and 
arms and lips wandered at will.

Keeping locked her bare arms around Madsen&#39;s neck, and used her slight 
height advantage to scoot closer, lean forward, and place her lips over 
her lover&#39;s nose as she moaned. Hitomi now had Keeping&#39;s breasts in her 
face, her legs parted and inviting, so without hesitation she crawled 
her fingers over and penetrated her lover, one single loving digit at a 
time. She stabbed with such intimate care that Abby merely sighed, so 
her hand caressed the naked vagina before her as her mouth dashed out to 
brush against the older woman&#39;s neck. Her nose became imprisoned inside 
Keeping&#39;s lips as her touch became rough, prodding and pushing&#151;pushing 
Keeping off the edge.

The moans she heard soon became better than the music now silenced. Her 
lover&#39;s breath splayed out on her face&#151;their lips sometimes met and 
locked so tightly that only muffled sounds could be heard&#151;but she kept 
her caresses, rubbing faster or slower depending on how she felt her 
lover would reciprocate. Abby moaned loud, soft, or not at all, letting 
the silence express overwhelming love (or lust) as she came to an 
orgasm, soaking her lover&#39;s hand rather messily. She breathed very hard 
in jagged, deep gasps for some time, feeling Hitomi&#39;s hand still upon 
her, her lips touching her chin, her breasts enticing in their glorious 
freedom.

They shared a smile and many kisses. Abby excused herself briefly, and 
wobbled to the kitchen where, in a move that was both cute and silly, 
she used a damp rag to &quot;clean up&quot;. Hitomi cleaned her hand orally.

&quot;You look really sexy,&quot; she noted, swishing her hair to the side. Abby 
blushed, nude and beautiful, and wandered back to her lover, who awaited 
with open arms. She fell back into Madsen&#39;s grasp, but rolled around 
gently so that Hitomi was now beneath her. She grinned playfully and 
held up a finger, saying only two words: &quot;My turn.&quot; Hitomi gasped in 
anticipation, and increased her breathing as Abby kissed her bosom, her 
lower chest, her tummy (paying at least five minute&#39;s attention on the 
navel alone), her waist&#151;she shrieked as her beloved Abby licked her 
pubic hair, then descended further down for the main prize itself.

For the life of her, Hitomi Madsen could not really recall being 
conscious during the time her lover was down there. For that matter, she 
never really felt awake until her rupturing orgasm, which Keeping was 
more than happy to clean (also orally).

But Abby was relentless and kept her mouth smothered over her vagina in 
spite of drawing a very strong orgasm from her love. Hitomi squealed 
helplessly as she continued her oral care, unsure why Abby kept herself 
there after achieving her goal. She wasn&#39;t a veteran when it came to 
sex, but didn&#39;t lovers usually stop after orgasm? Abby did not, though, 
and for the next five-to-seven minutes, Hitomi was exceedingly grateful 
for it.

She recalled the beauty of the ballet, the tranquility of the opera, the 
shivers they both sent her, and how utterly pale and murky they both 
seemed in comparison to this new feeling, this raw sex. Abby crawled up 
Hitomi&#39;s body, inch by inch, dragging her arms, legs, breasts, and 
tongue up each section, until at last their mouths met and stayed in a 
loving embrace. Hitomi&#39;s mouth was becoming dry, so after some slow, 
sweet kisses, she excused herself and waddled to the sink. Abby gave a 
weak whistle as she stared at her lover&#39;s naked backside.

&quot;Nice ass,&quot; she called. Hitomi laughed and downed a whole glass, then 
returned with a smile. She drew Abby up from the couch, eyes 
penetrating, and let her guide her by hand to the bedroom. Hitomi 
suddenly took her lover in her arms when they got inside, and twirled 
her around, laughing until they were both dizzy, and fell on top of the 
bed, bouncing once before settling. Nude, she curled next to Abby and 
teased her face tenderly.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe what we just did,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Made love on our first date. I promised myself I&#39;d never do that.&quot;

&quot;Hmm. It was a bit sudden. I didn&#39;t think things would go this far so 
quickly. Are you sorry?&quot; Hitomi giggled and kissed her lover&#39;s cheek, 
folding her arms over her protectively.

&quot;No, not at all. I think our little lust session was justified. We 
needed that. Like a champagne bottle under too much pressure that was 
suddenly uncorked.&quot; Abby laughed at the analogy; she could just imagine 
jerking the cork away violently, and having its contents spill out 
everywhere, and how parallel the image was to their recent sexual 
congress.

&quot;Mm, we definitely spurted. I think you&#39;re right. Too much frustration, 
bad luck, lost moments, little things... We needed a release. And it&#39;s 
not like we&#39;re strangers. I love you, and I was honored to make love to 
you.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; Hitomi chuckled and held Abby close, kissing the nape of her 
neck as she got lost in her dark hair. &quot;I love you too,&quot; she whispered, 
&quot;very, very much. So now what are we to do?&quot;

&quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;Lovemaking. I mean, it&#39;s clear we both enjoyed it, but we&#39;re still new 
in the relationship. This one exception was all right, but I think we 
should cut down on our randiness until we&#39;re really ready.&quot;

&quot;Mm, I agree, but it&#39;s going to be tough. I kinda want you to ravish me 
right now.&quot; Hitomi laughed and groaned at the same time.

&quot;Ugh, I don&#39;t have any energy left. You sucked it out of me, 
literally&#151;not that I&#39;m really complaining.&quot;

&quot;Oh, thanks.&quot;

&quot;I mean it,&quot; she said, kissing Abby. Keeping held her lover&#39;s arms close 
to her naked body, and since it was getting cold, she fought to curl 
underneath her bedsheets, with Madsen still enveloping her. They sighed 
in contentment, letting silence speak since they did not quite trust the 
moment to words. Not for awhile.

&quot;So does this make us lovers?&quot;

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. Like you said, we badly needed the sex, but I 
don&#39;t think either of us are ready for a sexual relationship. The cork&#39;s 
off and we can breathe again, to use that wonderful analogy, but now I 
want to enjoy the taste of champagne. And you&#39;re quite intoxicating, so 
let&#39;s not get too drunk in the future.&quot; She giggled.

&quot;Right. But what if I want to have sex with you again? What if, you 
know, I can&#39;t control myself?&quot;

&quot;Mm. Let&#39;s try and behave. If we must, we may as well so we don&#39;t go 
mad, but otherwise...&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; A pause.

&quot;...Did I hurt your feelings?&quot;

&quot;No, of course not. I agree. You are very convincing. One of the many 
reasons why I love you, sweetheart.&quot;

&quot;I love you too... princess.&quot; Madsen giggled.

&quot;I haven&#39;t been called princess in years!&quot;

&quot;Should I not call you that?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, do as you wish. I like it. Makes me feel young again. Nnn, what 
time is it?&quot;

&quot;One... thirty-seven.&quot;

&quot;Damn... we&#39;ve been at it for hours.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. We&#39;d better get to sleep or we&#39;ll never wake up for school.&quot;

&quot;Right, right.&quot; Abby and Hitomi smiled, and with a final good-night and 
I-love-you, they settled down, warm in each other&#39;s nakedness, and fell 
asleep several minutes later. It was a good way to end the evening, and 
better because it was really just the start.

Nobody knows

Just why we&#39;re here

Could it be fate

Or random circumstance

At the right place

At the right time

Two roads intertwine

And if the universe conspired

To meld our lives

To make us

Fuel and fire

Then know

Where ever you will be

So too shall I be

Close your eyes

Dry your tears

&#39;Coz when nothing seems clear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Weary heart

You&#39;ll be safe here

Remember how we laughed

Until we cried

At the most stupid things

Like we were so high

But love was all that we were on

We belong

And though the world would

Never understand

This unlikely union

And why it still stands

Someday we will be set free.

Pray and believe

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

Save your eyes

From your tears

When everything&#39;s unclear

You&#39;ll be safe here

From the sheer weight

Of your doubts and fears

Wounded heart

When the light disappears

And when this world&#39;s insincere

You&#39;ll be safe here

When nobody hears you scream

I&#39;ll scream with you

You&#39;ll be safe here

In my arms

Through the long cold night

Sleep tight

You&#39;ll be safe here

When no one understands

I&#39;ll believe

You&#39;ll be safe,

You&#39;ll be safe

You&#39;ll be safe here

Put your heart in my hands

You&#39;ll be safe here
