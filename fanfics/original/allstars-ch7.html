9:32 am

            &quot;Hello, am I speaking to Coach Parkin-Kata...uh...jisto?&quot;

            &quot;Katajisto, yes.  What can I do for you?&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m Dr. Thomas Righte of the Bedford Institute, calling to 
request the admission of one of my patients into your new soccer team.  
It&#39;s my professional opinion that this will benefit her and bring her to 
trust in others.  Uh, I hope I&#39;m not talking over your head here.&quot;

            &quot;No, but I might need to listen to the whole story before I 
commit.  We&#39;re actually very low on players right now, and I&#39;m not in 
the habit of just picking people at random off the street.&quot;

            &quot;I understand, but we&#39;ve enrolled her at the local college, 
and an extracurricular activity will help her therapy.  But you&#39;re 
right; I should tell you more.  Are you available later today?&quot;

            &quot;Anytime before 2:00.&quot;

            &quot;All right, uh...is there anywhere we can meet?&quot;

            &quot;There&#39;s a quiet little caf&eacute; across the street.  It&#39;s the 
Lily Club.  I hear they have a pretty decent bistro.  Maybe you could 
treat me for my troubles.&quot;

            &quot;Consider it done,&quot; he smiled.  &quot;So later today at two, in 
the Lily Club.  I appreciate your time.&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re welcome.  See you then.&quot;  They both hung up and the 
psychiatrist circled the time and location in his notes.  He then dialed 
Alice Hawthorne&#39;s number and patiently waited for her to answer.

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Business Lunch&quot;

            With nine players recruited in two days, the status of the 
team was looking good.  They still had a ways to go--they needed at 
least two more players, and most of their lineup had been amateurs and 
beginners just a few days earlier--but they were making excellent 
progress.  The women had four major obligations to meet, and they 
competed with each other for time and space; it was by far the most 
challenging task the team had faced, and it would continue to challenge 
them until they managed to find a happy medium.  There was school, work, 
practice, and a social life to consider, and usually, one had to be 
sacrificed to meet the demands of another.

            The various careers the players occupied themselves with 
were as unique as the women themselves.  Fausta and Terra labored at 
Parody bookstore, Felicity and Nadia shared shifts at the Lily Club, 
Elisa buried herself in the school library, Lauren was employed in a 
garage, Freya owned her own graphics design business, Shannon occupied 
herself at a local deli, Amy never mentioned where she worked, and 
Kasumi was unemployed, being forced to quit her last job when she moved 
(which was perfectly all right with her).  They would all be forced to 
work part-time once school and practice started up, or else quit their 
jobs entirely, but with every problem comes a solution:  most employers 
were lenient enough to allow this, and Gardenia and Robin gave their 
student staff a few days off to organize their lives.

            That free time would be well spent.  Most of the women were 
first-time students, either fresh from high school or an academic 
hiatus, and would have to sign up for classes and financial aid.  At 
twenty, Kasumi feared that she would be too old to be counted as a 
first-year student, but Kathlyn, who had volunteered to guide her 
through the registration process, assured her that this was not the 
case.  In fact, she herself was 24 years old, just starting her final 
year of medical study, and this would be her first time at Carnegie as 
well--and there would be even older students coming here for the first 
time, all with a variety of reasons for holding out this long.  Kasumi 
still felt like all this was too good to be true--a free ride through 
her education, the chance to play sports, a change of scenery, freedom 
from her old job--and she sat through most of the process with a 
stunned, cautious, faintly giddy expression.

            &quot;Hey, you still with us?&quot; Kathlyn said, waving her hand in 
Kasumi&#39;s face.  &quot;I know it&#39;s been a headache so far, but we&#39;re almost 
finished.  We just have to arrange a class schedule, buy your books, and 
get a parking permit.  Uh, do you drive?&quot;  Kasumi blinked and quickly 
came back to reality.

            &quot;No.  I mean, I have a license, but I usually just take a 
bike.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, cool.  That&#39;ll save you some money.  Permits aren&#39;t 
part of the scholarship.  So what classes did you mean to take?&quot;

            &quot;Well, I don&#39;t really know.  I still haven&#39;t decided what I 
want to study.  I really just wanted to get into college; I thought I&#39;d 
figure the rest out later.  Is it okay if I say I&#39;m Undeclared for right 
now?&quot;

            &quot;Sure, we can just get you some general classes so you&#39;ll 
have plenty of credits covered for next year.  Uh, since you&#39;ll be on 
the team,  we may have to get you signed up for part-time.  Do you have 
a job?&quot;

            &quot;No, not yet.  I still haven&#39;t finished moving in, and the 
rest of my stuff is back at my old place.  I mean, I want a job, but I 
don&#39;t know who&#39;s hiring.&quot;

            &quot;I can&#39;t help you there,&quot; Kathlyn shrugged as she hunted 
around the registrar office for a list of classes.  She found a stack of 
them and brought one over to Kasumi, highlighting several basic courses 
that could apply towards any degree.  &quot;I&#39;m pretty new here myself,&quot; she 
said while moving around, &quot;and I don&#39;t know my way around.  How about 
this lineup?  I&#39;ve got you down for Writing, College Algebra, Intro to 
Physics, and Computer Information.  I didn&#39;t give you any more since I 
figured you&#39;d already have a full schedule.&quot;

            &quot;That looks fine,&quot; she said, studying the times her classes 
began and ended.  She would be busy from Monday to Thursday, but she 
would have a nice three-day weekend as well.  Finalizing her schedule 
wasn&#39;t too much of a hassle, and her books, while expensive, were all 
ready for her and in good condition.  The hard part would be finding a 
job, and since Kathlyn didn&#39;t know of any places, and Kasumi didn&#39;t have 
any friends she could ask, she was stuck for a moment.

            &quot;I guess you could call Leena,&quot; Kathlyn suggested as she 
walked outside the offices.  &quot;Although I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll tell you the same 
thing I did, it&#39;s worth a shot.  Oh, uh, maybe you can call our new 
manager as well.  I&#39;m sure with all her charm, she has plenty of 
connections.&quot;

            &quot;Is that what we&#39;re calling it?&quot; Kasumi smirked.  Kathlyn 
gave her the two numbers and wished her luck; Kasumi waited until she 
was back in her small apartment before calling them.  She had been 
walking around campus and carting those books for hours; she needed time 
off her feet.  After getting a snack and a drink, she plucked her old 
cell phone from its charger and started to dial Leena&#39;s number.  Before 
she could press a single button, however, the phone rang, surprising 
her.  She recognized the number:  it was one of the two Kathlyn had 
given her.

            &quot;Is this Freya von Hohenheim?&quot; she tested.

            &quot;It certainly is!&quot; she sang.  &quot;Your caller ID must be very 
impressive!&quot;

            &quot;Actually, I just came home after registering for classes, 
and Katt gave me your number.  I was hoping you could help me find a 
job.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, certainly!  A great manager will always help her 
friends in need!  Actually, I&#39;m very glad you said that, because my 
computer graphics company has expanded, and I need more people!  Would 
you be interested?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, I&#39;ve never done anything like that before.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, allerdings, how silly of me!  Dummkopf!  Perhaps I 
should ask what kind of experience you have.&quot;

            &quot;Well, I worked at a bookstore for awhile, but it closed 
during my senior year of high school.  There was also this...other place 
I went to, sort of like a restaurant...&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;ll have to be more specific, Beckett-san.  There are 
restaurants and there are restaurants, nein?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, yeah.  Look, maybe you can just tell me if there are 
any bookstores that are hiring.&quot;

            &quot;None that I know of,&quot; Freya stated glumly.  &quot;I did some 
intense research before arriving here, just in case one of our players 
needed a job.  Parody Bookstores is right next to campus, but they&#39;re 
not hiring.  Was this restaurant a fast-food place, or a...restaurant?&quot;  
Kasumi growled in frustration.  It wasn&#39;t like her last job was 
unbearable--she had been there for about two years--it was just 
humiliating to talk about.  She didn&#39;t want anybody knowing about it 
unless it was necessary, and given the size of her bank account, that 
time was drawing close.

            &quot;It was a gay bar in DC,&quot; she grumbled, &quot;but you can&#39;t tell 
anybody, all right?  I don&#39;t want any bad rumors going around.&quot;

            &quot;Certainly not!  Your manager keeps things held in the 
strictest confidence!&quot;

            So why is it that you know my telephone number?

            &quot;So a gay bar,&quot; Freya whispered, perfectly unaffected by the 
idea.  &quot;Hmm.  This is actually where Maria comes in handy.  Der 
Perversling did some research on her own, and came up with something 
called &#39;Out and About&#39;.  Apparently, it&#39;s a lesbian nightclub that&#39;s 
hiring.  Would you be interested in that?&quot;

            &quot;Are you asking if I&#39;m a lesbian?&quot; Kasumi growled harshly.  
Freya laughed.

            &quot;No, no, of course not.  I&#39;m just asking if you&#39;d like to 
consider working there.  You&#39;re the tall Japanese woman I saw the other 
day, right?  The one with a silver streak in her hair?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, you got the right description, but the wrong country.  
I&#39;m an American; my parents just named me after a Japanese waitress.&quot;

            &quot;How very strange,&quot; Freya mused.  &quot;Well, anyway, you&#39;re a 
very beautiful woman, at least from what I could tell.  I&#39;m sure the 
owner will hire you.  Give it some thought.  Oh, one more thing, 
Beckett-san--I mean, Miss Beckett.  I&#39;ve invited some of the other 
members of the team to a meeting later today.  Do you know where the 
Chili&#39;s in Alave Center is?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, we passed by it earlier today.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, great!  Please be there around 12:45, and don&#39;t worry 
about the bill!  Your manager will be handling all expenses!  Talk to 
you soon, okay?&quot;

            &quot;All right.&quot;  Kasumi couldn&#39;t help but smile warmly.  
Despite Freya&#39;s eccentricities, she sounded like a sweet woman, very 
caring and compassionate.  Could this possibly be the first friend she 
made in her new life?  She breathed deeply and went for a phone book, 
thumbing through until she reached the Os.  &quot;Out and About, huh...&quot;

            She put her old cell phone to use one more time.

--Elisa Berkeley, 21, 5&#39;7.5&quot; (1.71 m), no position--

            Shannon Threal pursed her lips impatiently as she heard the 
dial tone singing.  She was calling her best friend, Scott Bardine, 
about how she had fared in yesterday&#39;s try-outs.  It was still fairly 
early in the morning, however, so Shannon hoped she wouldn&#39;t be 
intruding, even though she knew that if she called him at three in the 
morning with an emergency, he would drop everything and rush to her 
side--and she would do the same.  At last, he answered her call.

            &quot;Hey, g&#39;mawnin&#39;, Threal For Real,&quot; he said playfully.

            &quot;Mawnin&#39; yahself, Nova Scotia.  Ya know why I&#39;m calling you 
at such an ungodly hour?&quot;  He did, of course, but he would toy with her 
first.

            &quot;Uh...you got lucky and wanted to gossip.&quot;

            &quot;Aw, so close!&quot; she hissed.

            &quot;Okay, um...there&#39;s a gnome in ya bathroom and ya want I 
should get ridda it.&quot;

            &quot;Nah, getting colder.&quot;

            &quot;You won the lottery?!&quot; he squealed.  Shannon laughed and 
let him have it.

            &quot;No, ya moron, I got into the team!&quot;

            &quot;I know,&quot; he sang.  &quot;But was there ever any question?&quot;

            &quot;Actually, you&#39;re more right than ya know,&quot; she stated 
seriously.  &quot;For a school that just stahted a program, they didn&#39;t have 
very many people there.  I mean, it ain&#39;t been but a few days, but 
there&#39;s only nine of us there--ten if ya count the managah.&quot;

            &quot;You have a managah?&quot;  She could easily imagine him balking.

            &quot;Self-appointed,&quot; she noted.  &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s a few inches 
short a yahd, and she&#39;s got these hanger-ons that follah her around.&quot;

            &quot;Hangers-on,&quot; he corrected flatly.

            &quot;Oh, whatevah!  It&#39;s not like anybody cares.  I can speak 
proper English if I want; it&#39;s just more comfortable this way.  So 
what&#39;s new on your end?&quot;

            &quot;Meh, same old.  It&#39;s hahd finding&#39; a job here.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, tell me about it.  I mean, if you don&#39;t mind being 
surrounded by homos, there&#39;s plenty of places to find work.&quot;

            &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; he grinned.

            &quot;I&#39;ve got nothing&#39; against them either!&quot; she insisted, &quot;So 
long as they keep their hands to themselves.  Um, I mean, I&#39;d make an 
exception if a cute guy wanted to snuggle with you.&quot;

            &quot;Perv,&quot; he snickered.  &quot;So what are the other girls like?  
Oh, excuse me--what are the women like?&quot;  She laughed at his 
condescending political correctness, but as she began to think about it, 
Shannon couldn&#39;t formulate a good answer.

            &quot;Uh, well, the thing is, I don&#39;t really know.  I was only 
able to see a few of em&#39; the other day.  There was our manager, some 
German gal, and this Asian gal that stuttered.  Uh, there was one more, 
but I didn&#39;t catch her name.&quot;

            &quot;They&#39;re on your team, Shan,&quot; Scott harangued.  &quot;I know 
you&#39;re busy, but haven&#39;t&#39;cha taken any time outta your day to talk with 
em&#39;?&quot;

            &quot;Not yet,&quot; she admitted.  I&#39;ll bet most of em&#39; are gay 
anyway, she thought to herself.  &quot;We&#39;ll have plenty of time for that 
latah.  Classes don&#39;t start until Wednesday next week, and I&#39;ll bet we 
won&#39;t even have practice until later.  Ah...hold on a second.&quot;  Her 
phone glowed and began to vibrate, indicating she had another call 
coming in.  &quot;Some jerk I don&#39;t know is tryin&#39; to call me.  I bettah go 
see what they want.&quot;

            &quot;You don&#39;t have to, y&#39;know,&quot; Scott told her.  &quot;You can just 
ignore them and keep talkin&#39; to me.&quot;

            &quot;I know, but I ain&#39;t rude!  I&#39;ll talk to you latah, 
Scotland.&quot;

            &quot;All right, fine.  Love ya lots, Shannon the Cannon.&quot;  
Click, click.  Shannon took a deep breath and studied the incoming 
number.  Carefully, she pressed the Call button and braced herself for 
anything:  &quot;This is Shannon Threal&#39;s phone, may I ask who&#39;s calling?&quot;

            &quot;Ah, guten morgen, Frau Threal!  I&#39;m so glad I was able to 
reach you!  Who were you talking to just now?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, excuse me!&quot; she barked.  &quot;First off, I don&#39;t know who 
the hell you are, and second, it&#39;s none of your freakin&#39; business who I 
was talkin&#39; to!&quot;

            &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so snappy!&quot; chirped the other voice--a young 
lady&#39;s with a German accent.  &quot;I&#39;m just curious.  I want to get to know 
my teammates, so it&#39;s essential that I pry into their outside lives.  
Just think of it as two friends coming closer together.&quot;

            &quot;We&#39;re not friends, you...wait, hold on!  Is this that 
German gal from the otha day, the one who wanted to be our managah?&quot;

            &quot;Ja, bingo!  Freya Serhild von Hohenheim at your service!  
Oh, wait, I didn&#39;t actually introduce myself to you the other day, did 
I?&quot;

            &quot;No--and how&#39;d you get this numbah?&quot;

            &quot;Your manager has her resources!&quot; Freya exclaimed proudly.  
&quot;Suffice to say that it was a matter of espionage and careful recording!  
As your manager, I must keep in contact with every member of the team, 
and you&#39;re last on my list!&quot;

            &quot;Lucky me,&quot; Shannon grumbled.

            &quot;You ARE lucky!&quot; Freya squealed, her voice alarmingly sharp, 
especially at this hour.  &quot;I don&#39;t mean to brag, but I&#39;m really quite 
good at organizing institutions!  Did I tell you I run my own business?  
Oh, and Shiki and Maria will be helping out as well!  I actually came up 
with seven new ideas after the try-outs yesterday!!&quot;

            &quot;Ya lost me,&quot; Shannon groaned as she tumbled into a chair.

            &quot;Es tut mir leid.  I am getting a little confusing, no?  
Tell you what:  Shiki and Maria have been helping me make my calls, and 
we&#39;ve decided to get everyone together later on for a team meeting.  
There was some debate about which restaurant to choose, so I just picked 
the one that&#39;s closest in proximity to your locations.  Do you know the 
Chili&#39;s in the Alave Center?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah--uh, wait, so you also know where we live?!&quot;

            &quot;Just in case I ever need to send Shiki over for anything.  
Surely we have at least one forgetful person in our ranks.  Don&#39;t worry, 
I haven&#39;t abused my powers yet!&quot;

            That&#39;s discomforting, Shannon grumbled to herself.  But 
whatever.

            &quot;So are you going to invite the whole team?&quot;

            &quot;Everyone that&#39;s on my list,&quot; Freya replied.  &quot;The Coach and 
Kathlyn declined, unfortunately, and Frau Nguyen said she had to work, 
but the others seemed pretty enthusiastic!  It&#39;ll be you, me, Shiki, 
Maria, Elisa, Fausta, Lauren, Terra, Kasumi, Felicity, and Nadia.&quot;  That 
had been the first time Shannon heard her teammate&#39;s names; she hoped 
she would be able to remember them, or at least rely on them.

            &quot;Okay, so the Chili&#39;s in Alave.  All right, I know where 
that is.  What time?&quot;

            &quot;Well, according to the schedule I have--I mean, the one the 
others gave me--the best time to meet would be around 12:45.  Can you 
make it?&quot;

            &quot;Sure, not like it&#39;s fah away.  And at least ya gave me a 
heads-up.&quot;

            &quot;Consideration for others is a cornerstone of my moral 
foundation,&quot; Freya recited.  &quot;I hope to see you there, Frau Threal!  Uh, 
I guess from now on, I can call you Shannon.  Is that all right?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, sure, I s&#39;pose.  Uh, guten tag, I guess!&quot;

            &quot;Ah, wunderbar!  Auf wiedersehen!&quot;  Shannon hung up and 
stuck her tongue out.  She was worn-out just from talking to Freya over 
the phone; she didn&#39;t want to think how working alongside her would 
affect her.

--Fausta Nazario, 19, 5&#39;11&quot; (1.8 cm), sweeper position--

            While Freya, Maria, and Shiki were organizing things over at 
Chili&#39;s, Leena was waiting patiently inside the Lily Club for Dr. Righte 
to arrive.  Gardenia greeted her and gave an experienced appraisal:  she 
liked what she saw, but was stricken when she noticed the ring on her 
left hand.

            &quot;Damn, already spoken for!&quot; she muttered.  Lau overheard her 
and rolled her eyes.  Shortly after Leena found a table, a man in his 
mid-forties entered the caf&eacute;, scanning it for someone.  Men were a very 
unusual sight in the Lily Club, so he drew all kinds of attention, 
including Leena&#39;s.  She walked over to him, found out who he was, shook 
his hand, and took him to the counter, where Nadia would&#39;ve been if she 
hadn&#39;t taken the day off (hearing that two of her employees were going 
to a team meeting, Gardenia insisted that they take an extended lunch 
break).  Miss Kemper was there instead, unable to tear her eyes away 
from Leena&#39;s beautifully-sculpted body, wedding ring or not.

            &quot;So what can I get you two?&quot;

            &quot;Just a salmon bake, please,&quot; Leena said.

            &quot;Minestrone soup and grilled cheese for me, and two waters,&quot; 
Dr. Righte said.  He paid for it like he promised and took Leena to her 
table.  They ate for about a minute before getting down to business.

            &quot;Well, as I said over the phone earlier, I&#39;m a psychiatrist 
for the Bedford Institute, and I have a patient in my care who would 
probably do well if she were put on some kind of sports team.  The 
exercise and social interaction would be perfect for her.  I&#39;ve brought 
a few notes with me if you&#39;d like to look over them.&quot;  He handed Leena a 
folder containing his observations of the subject over a period of time, 
and she skimmed over a few.

            &quot;Alice Hawthorne,&quot; she read aloud.  &quot;Hmm...schizophrenic 
paranoia.  If you weren&#39;t pushing it so much, doctor, I&#39;d be a lot more 
cautious.  How much improvement has she made since?&quot;

            &quot;Keep reading,&quot; he pointed, relishing his lunch.  She bit 
into her salmon bake and continued.

            &quot;Hmm.  It seems like her family is partially to blame for 
her condition.  I noticed her regression when they came to visit.&quot;

            &quot;Yes,&quot; he murmured, &quot;they&#39;re not very...good people.  It&#39;d 
be best not to mention them to her, or the incident which led her to my 
care.&quot;  Leena nodded, and finally finished reading through the notes.

            &quot;Okay, I guess that answers my question.  She&#39;s not as 
dangerous as I thought, but I want you to keep something in mind, 
doctor.  If this were any normal incident, I would not be so willing to 
accept her into the team.  Don&#39;t misunderstand:  it&#39;s not because of her 
condition.  Lord knows we all have something wrong with us.  She just 
doesn&#39;t strike me as being experienced, and I can&#39;t take in too many 
beginners--we&#39;re here to win, not just to play.&quot;

            &quot;I understand, but she has lots of potential.&quot;

            &quot;We all have potential for something,&quot; Leena sighed as she 
gave the notes back.  He urged her to keep them, though, for future 
reference.  &quot;Hmm, well, if you insist.  I guess a doctor&#39;s 
confidentiality code can extend to Coaches if need be.  All right, I&#39;ll 
see what I can do with her.  If she can be taught, then I&#39;m willing to 
teach.  One more thing:  does she require medication?&quot;

            &quot;No, it&#39;s not so severe anymore.  Just be patient with her, 
and treat her like a rational being.  There&#39;s a brilliant mind behind 
that meek fa&ccedil;ade, Miss Parkin-Kata...uh...forgive me.&quot;

            &quot;I told you, Leena&#39;s fine,&quot; she smiled.  She finished half 
her sandwich while reading the rest of Righte&#39;s notes, wondering if 
there was anything she could do to help the young woman.  Hawthorne was 
a jittery loner who stood out from a crowd, towering at a staggering two 
meters in height, prone to paranoia and even, if unchecked, sporadic 
attacks.  But she also had remarkable marks in the sciences and looked 
like she was aiming for a career in neurochemistry.  Leena wasn&#39;t sure 
how this gentle giant would benefit the team, but she would take her 
regardless, and hope for the best.

            &quot;Wilkommen, bienvenue, and welcome!  I&#39;m so glad you could 
all make it!&quot;  A cute golden-haired woman with bright green eyes and a 
somewhat lithe figure waved frantically as members of the team stepped 
into the local Chili&#39;s restaurant.  For those that knew her, this was 
Freya Serhild von Hohenheim (at their service), no longer confined to 
her wheelchair thanks to some rest and tender care.  Her shimmering 
blonde hair trickled all the way down to her waist, and she had it 
braided and tied so it wouldn&#39;t get caught in anything; one of the women 
standing beside her kept playing with it.  She looked much healthier 
than Freya, and her face glowed with a strong, playful, erotic light:  
this was Maria Maethers, Freya&#39;s best friend and personal designer.  The 
other woman stood directly next to Freya, quietly watching for the 
guests to arrive, dressed out of her maid uniform (for once) and into a 
more modern style that had been directly imported from Shibuya, Japan:  
this was Shiki Araya, Freya&#39;s personal maid, bodyguard, and other best 
friend.

            &quot;Sweet,&quot; said Lauren as she stared at the three women.  They 
were all stunning and oozed sensuality--her kind of girl.  &quot;So you&#39;re 
the hyperactive team manager I&#39;ve heard about.  Pretty killer.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m actually a bit feeble,&quot; Freya explained solemnly.  &quot;I 
was only being energetic for the sake of the team.  I figured that the 
best way to draw them all in would be to encourage their spirits.&quot;  
Lauren cringed and ruffled her hair, not sure what to make of this 
bizarre response.

            &quot;Okay, sounds fine.  So where&#39;s the rest of the pack?&quot;

            &quot;Some of them have already taken a seat,&quot; Shiki explained.  
&quot;We&#39;re just standing here waiting for the others.&quot;

            &quot;So I&#39;m not late?  Ach, damn, so much for being 
fashionable.&quot;

            &quot;Well, you&#39;re not early, either!&quot; Maria squealed.  She was 
definitely the energetic woman, and Lauren figured she&#39;d like her the 
most.

            &quot;I guess that&#39;s cool.  So can I get one of you ladies to 
lead me there, cuz&#39; I kinda don&#39;t know where they are.&quot;

            &quot;That would be your job, Araya-chan!&quot; Maria teased.  Shiki 
turned her nose up and ignored her archrival.

            &quot;If you&#39;ll follow me, please.  Milady, please take care of 
Maria while I&#39;m gone, since she&#39;s obviously incapable of doing it 
herself.&quot;

            &quot;At least I can take a piss without telling Freya about it 
first!&quot;  Shiki walked away calmly, holding up her middle finger, which 
Maria returned boldly, sticking her tongue out for good measure.  
Naturally, somebody came in and saw it.

            &quot;Ugh, I think I&#39;m in the wrong place.  I was expecting a 
restaurant but came to a bar instead.&quot;  Maria croaked and wheeled around 
to apologize; Freya laughed it off and greeted the newcomers.

            &quot;No, this is the right place.  You must be Fausta, correct?&quot;

            &quot;That&#39;s right, and this is Terra.  We sort of work 
together.&quot;

            &quot;Hello,&quot; Terra said, smiling shyly.  Maria squealed at how 
cute she was; Freya gently pushed her aside.

            &quot;Just follow the babbling lunatic and you&#39;ll find the table.  
Ah, and here come our final guests!&quot;  She waved cheerily as Felicity and 
Kasumi came through the doors, both of them looking a little out of 
place.  They had just learned a few hours ago that they would be 
roommates, so needless to say, the trip over was an interesting one 
(Felicity took Kasumi in her new sedan).

            &quot;You made it!&quot; Freya exclaimed to them both.  &quot;Many happy 
greetings!  If you&#39;ll just follow me, I&#39;ll bring you to your table!  
Better than a waitress, nein?&quot;

            It was difficult finding a seat for everyone--there were 
eleven women there, so the staff had to push four tables together--and 
just as challenging making introductions.  Lauren, being one of the 
loudest and most charismatic, stood up and opened the floor for 
everyone, asking that they give their names and tell a little about 
themselves.

            &quot;Going first, I&#39;m Lauren, the resident baseball-playing 
lesbian.  You next, karate kid!&quot;

            &quot;Uh, I&#39;m Terra, and I&#39;m into video games and manga--and Tae 
Kwon Do, actually!&quot;

            &quot;Semantics,&quot; Lauren snorted.  &quot;Next!&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m Kasumi, uhh, and I&#39;m not Japanese.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m Felicity...uh...and I like watching House.&quot;

            &quot;Fausta Nazario, from Italy.&quot;

            &quot;My name is Elisa, and, uh, I absolutely cannot dance.&quot;

            &quot;Nadia is name, and favorite book is Netochka Nezvanova.&quot;

            &quot;You all know me, but I&#39;d just like to say that I own my own 
company!&quot;

            &quot;Maria Maethers, fashion designer!&quot;

            &quot;I am Araya Shiki, Hohenheim-dono&#39;s personal assistant.&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m Shannon, and I love the Cleveland Cavaliers.&quot;

            &quot;Seems we&#39;re missing one,&quot; Terra observed.  Her new friend 
Amy was not in the group.

            &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right, Frau Nguyen said she had to work.  I 
asked her if we could just come visit her, but she didn&#39;t tell me 
where--&quot;  Just then, a waitress came by their table, stuttering 
awkwardly.

            &quot;W-w-welcome to Ch-Chili&#39;s, m-m-m-my name is Am-m-my, can I 
interest y-you in an appet-tizer and some d-drinks to s-start you off?&quot;

            &quot;Hey!!&quot; Terra exclaimed, her face lighting up.  &quot;So this is 
where you work!  What a coincidence!  Now the whole team is here!&quot;

            &quot;Exactly what I was about to say!&quot; Freya squealed.  Amy&#39;s 
face turned white as she stared at the eleven women sitting together; 
she recognized a handful of them from the try-outs yesterday.  &quot;Go on 
and introduce yourself to everybody, Amy!  This is Terra, Kasumi, 
Felicity, Fausta, Lauren, Elisa, Nadia, Shannon, Shiki, Maria, and I am 
your humble manager, Freya Serhild von Hohenheim, at your service!&quot;

            &quot;Uh...um...hm.&quot;  Amy&#39;s voice turned hoarse and she backed 
away, not used to so many eyes staring at her.  She fought to keep her 
composure and her manners.  &quot;F-fine.  It&#39;s n-nice to m-meet you all.  
Th-thanks for s-stopping by so I c-could s-see you.  M-my name is Amy, 
and I&#39;m p-part of the team.&quot;

            &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so timid around us,&quot; Elisa said 
warmly.  &quot;Barring a few miscreants, we&#39;re all very nice people.&quot;

            &quot;She&#39;s stuttering, fool,&quot; Fausta grumbled.  She knew 
perfectly well who that last comment had been aimed at.

            &quot;I know that!&quot; Elisa snapped.  &quot;I&#39;m just trying to get her 
to relax.  Uh, sorry for the show there, dearie.  I think I&#39;m ready to 
order now.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, me too,&quot; Lauren sighed.  &quot;God, I&#39;m so fucking hungry, 
I could eat a fucking stegosaurus.&quot;  A few of the girls snickered at her 
vulgarity; Freya rolled her eyes but said nothing.  It wasn&#39;t her place 
to reprimand people.

            &quot;None of that on this menu,&quot; Nadia noted.  She squinted her 
eyes and ribbed Shannon, who she had been forced to sit next to 
(Felicity was too far away).  &quot;I still am having trouble with American 
alphabet.  Years in Enkland seem like big waste.  You tell me what 
thingz are that I am pointed to, okay?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, sure.  Whaddya want?&quot;

            &quot;No steak or milk, makes belly ache.  You not have blini 
here, Amy?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, n-no, I don&#39;t even kn-know what th-that is.&quot;

            &quot;Is good Russian dessert!&quot; Nadia chirped.  She sighed and 
gave her menu to Amy.  &quot;I will be having Bottomless Express Lunch with 
potato zoup and...what is looking like Czar salad.  How iz this said, 
Shannon?&quot;

            &quot;Caesar salad.&quot;

            &quot;Da, what she said!&quot;  Amy quietly wrote it down and asked 
for everyone else&#39;s order.

            &quot;I think everyone knows what I&#39;m getting!&quot; Lauren proclaimed 
proudly.  She then sang the famous &quot;Baby-back ribs&quot; song, and a few 
girls even joined in.  Those that did not sing, sighed.

            &quot;They have more than ribs, you know,&quot; Fausta muttered.  
&quot;I&#39;ll take the Mesquite chicken salad, please.&quot;

            &quot;I guess I&#39;ll go for the fajita quesadillas,&quot; Terra said.

            Kasumi:  &quot;Ooh, give me the quesadilla explosion!&quot;

            Felicity:  &quot;Uh, chicken crispers for me.&quot;

            Elisa:  &quot;Chicken club tacos, please.  And Fausta, if you 
make any comments, I shall quit being your friend.&quot;

            &quot;Whaaat,&quot; she whined.  &quot;I didn&#39;t say anything.&quot;

            &quot;Keep it that way,&quot; she muttered.  Several women giggled; a 
few wondering if they were witnessing a lover&#39;s quarrel.

            &quot;The three of us will split two triple dippers, with one of 
each choice,&quot; Freya announced.  &quot;And we&#39;d also like to treat everyone to 
some molten chocolate cake later.&quot;

            &quot;Then I suppose I&#39;ll just have the turkey combo with a side 
of enchilada soup,&quot; Shannon sighed.  Amy muttered out a thanks and went 
to deliver their orders, but was stopped by Terra, who (luckily) didn&#39;t 
have to squeeze or push through anybody to step out.

            &quot;Hey, why don&#39;t you take a break and join us?  You are part 
of the team now.&quot;

            &quot;N-no, I&#39;ll g-get off w-work in th-th-three hours, but 
th-thank y-y-you anyway.&quot;

            &quot;Oh,&quot; she answered somberly.  &quot;Well, I&#39;ll be sure the others 
give you a big tip.  I know for a fact that Fausta and Freya are 
loaded!&quot;  Amy chuckled and grinned warmly; a blush crawled to her 
cheeks.  She had noticed how beautiful those two were, and wondered if 
they were her type.  She preferred people who were outgoing, kind, 
moral, and understanding, but her landlady insisted that she added rich 
to the list as well.  Terra came back and told everyone the news, and 
Freya promised that the next team meeting would include everyone.

            &quot;Before we all engage in social chatter, I&#39;d like to open 
the floor for a few proposals that correlate to the team.  Maria and I 
have been talking, and she&#39;s agreed to design your uniforms.&quot;

            &quot;Normally, this is the part where I&#39;d come in and protest,&quot; 
Shiki muttered with a smirk aimed directly at her rival, &quot;but her 
blueprints are actually quite impressive.  I&#39;m almost under the 
impression that this is a legitimate enterprise.&quot;

            &quot;That&#39;s because it is,&quot; Maria replied, beaming venomously.

            &quot;Is it now?&quot; Shiki countered.  &quot;So this isn&#39;t just another 
excuse to grope people or play dress-up?&quot;

            &quot;Such an active imagination to make so many baseless 
accusations!&quot;

            &quot;Oh, verdammt, I forgot to ask her for bottomless chips and 
salsa,&quot; Freya mused, ignoring her companions.  A very awkward silence 
fell, with Maria and Shiki leering at each other on one side and the 
rest of the team beset with bemusement on the other.

            &quot;Iz thiz what is called loving quarrels?&quot; Nadia asked.  Now 
the duo turned red.

            &quot;Actually, they do have sex with each other every now and 
then,&quot; Freya stated casually.  Now the duo gawked, turning darker and 
darker shades.

            &quot;Ah!  Fun, fun, fun!  The sexiez between you two is kawaii!  
So we will be having the football clothes to wear soon, yes?  What other 
idea are you to share?&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, you sort of got off track there for awhile,&quot; Lauren 
pointed out.  Freya agreed and submitted her second idea:  since Maria 
would be handling uniforms, Shiki would handle the cleaning duty, as 
well as the training process.  Terra lit up when she learned that Shiki, 
despite her calm and gentle appearance, was a master martial artist, and 
while her strength was only average, few could match her speed and 
agility (which was naturally interpreted as a challenge by the other 
women).  After making a few other pointers, Amy came by with drinks and 
appetizers, once more refusing to join them.  Terra asked that everybody 
give her a tip, so purses were opened and pockets were raided.  The rest 
of the meal was spent in idle chatter, just as Freya predicted, and 
gradually, the tiny soccer team of Carnegie University got to know 
everyone a little better.

--Felicity Velur, 19, 5&#39;10&quot; (1.77 m), striker or center-forward 
position--

            &quot;Alice, it&#39;s me again.  I have another appointment coming 
up, so I&#39;ll just make this quick.  I spoke with Coach Parkin-Kata...uh, 
with Leena, and she told me that she would be quite willing to have you 
on her team.  There are try-outs later today at the university, 
beginning around 2:30, so I hope you&#39;ve made a decision by now.  If 
you&#39;re really serious about recovering, you&#39;ll know what to do.  Keep me 
informed, please.&quot;

            She erased the message and stood numb in her small apartment 
room, still uncertain even after five days.  It was true that she wanted 
to return to normal society and be accepted as a healthy member of the 
human race, but with her condition--not to mention her immense, 
unladylike size--was that even possible?  The risks seemed to outweigh 
the benefits...and besides, she had never played sports in her life, or 
even shown an interest.  The doctor went through a lot of trouble for 
her, however, and it would be rude of her to just stand there in a daze, 
letting his efforts go to waste.

            &quot;Forget that,&quot; she grumbled to herself.  &quot;He&#39;d only just 
tell me how I feel about it.  Ach, and I still don&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t 
know, I don&#39;t know.  If God is still out there, give me a sign.  I need 
to know where to go.  I need to know what to do.&quot;

            But what DO you want to do?

            Alice looked outside her window, peering at the nearby 
campus, pursing her lips together.

Notes:  the items the women ordered are actual selections from a Chili&#39;s 
menu; I didn&#39;t make any of them up.  For an explanation of what Netochka 
Nezvanova is, please check it out in Wikipedia.
