<a href="../original/testfire-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;What have you heard about the Sisterhood?&quot; Jack asked
curiously as they headed up Hastings Street away from
the old Woodwards building. The sandy haired blonde
had been gone from the city for awhile, it was faintly
possible they might have changed.

&quot;They&#39;re all women,&quot; Motoko answered, the redhead
following gracefully, &quot;and they&#39;re completely
separatist. No men allowed, and if you try you may be
shot or even killed without warning. They do offer
sanctuary to women in distress, however.&quot;

Cole&#39;s eyes swept the memorial park as they raced by,
a few burned out buildings nearby. &quot;They hold the
Harbor Center Tower, the Simon Fraser University
facilities, and they expanded into the old Skytrain
station at the waterfront recently, too,&quot; she said
crisply.

&quot;Sounds like Bannon&#39;s interested in them,&quot; Jack
muttered, the trio racing by several rebuilt
buildings. Once they had been storefronts but now
people camped within, taking advantage of the relative
safety of the city itself.

&quot;Of course we are,&quot; Cole shrugged, &quot;having control
over the subway tunnels in Vancouver would be a coup
for the Mayor. That and having a group of crazies on
one of our borders does not make Bannon happy.&quot;

&quot;They aren&#39;t crazies,&quot; Motoko frowned, &quot;though I admit
they have a bad reputation.&quot;

&quot;Nice to know things haven&#39;t changed much since I was
away,&quot; Jack murmured as they slowed, nearing the
Harbor Center tower. Peering around the corner of a
nearby building the studied the situation carefully.
The old SFU section once had gleaming windows but they
were all boarded up now, the library within gutted by
fire. Armed women lurked outside, guns at the ready,
and they had a hard, dangerous look in their eyes.

&quot;So how do we do this?&quot; Cole asked softly, eyeing the
dozen women that were scattered around the area
warily.

&quot;The old-fashioned way,&quot; Jack answered as she boldly
stepped out from their cover. Weapons came up,
safeties clicking off as she bellowed, &quot;I&#39;m Jack Scott
damn it, and the first person to take a shot dies
horribly!&quot;

&quot;Oh shit,&quot; Motoko paled visibly.

&quot;You&#39;d do it too, wouldn&#39;t you?&quot; a surprisingly
pleasant sounding blonde said. An eye-patch covered
her left eye and scars marked the side of her face but
she moved with grace as she strode up to Jack. &quot;Been
awhile,&quot; and with that she crushed Jack to her in a
hug!

&quot;What in the...?&quot; Cole blinked as they women on guard
put up their guns and visibly relaxed.

&quot;Nice to see you&#39;re still alive, Milly,&quot; Jack grinned
up at her, laughing. Slipping free of the blonde&#39;s
grip she turned to call, &quot;Come out nice and slow,
okay?&quot;

Hesitantly Motoko and Cole stepped out of hiding,
carefully walking to Jack&#39;s side. &quot;You know these
people?&quot; Motoko asked softly.

&quot;Scott here helped kick Bannon&#39;s ass with us the last
time he tried to turf us out of here,&quot; Milly
explained, &quot;she actually held off a dozen troops in
one of the hallways till we could get reinforcements
to her. We&#39;d have lost the floor and maybe the
building if not for her.&quot;

&quot;That explains a lot,&quot; Cole gave Jack a frowning look.

&quot;I can&#39;t say I approve of your company, Jack,&quot; Milly
added as she scowled at Cole.

&quot;Not too thrilled with having her around myself,&quot; Jack
admitted, &quot;but it sounds like Rose is up to her old
tricks again.&quot;

&quot;Assassination attempt?&quot; Milly guessed.

&quot;Kidnapping and blackmail, this time,&quot; Jack shrugged,
&quot;she&#39;s trying to muscle a Lieutenant of the Shogun.
Cole offered to help, mostly to clear her boss&#39; name.&quot;

&quot;All right, I can buy that,&quot; Milly nodded. She turned
and waved for them to follow, &quot;How long do you need?&quot;

&quot;Day or two, probably,&quot; Jack said as they followed
through the armed women to the front doors, Milly
pushing the boards aside to get them access. It was
pretty well lit within, power provided by generators
guessing by the low hum in the background, and even
more armed women were set up in defensive positions
inside.

&quot;Are they expecting an invasion?&quot; Motoko whispered.

&quot;Probably,&quot; Cole answered, &quot;there&#39;s more than one
group in the city that&#39;d like to see the Sisterhood
taken off the maps.&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;ll beat them back just like always,&quot; Milly
said coldly. She raised an eyebrow at Jack, &quot;What kind
of resources has Rose got?&quot;

&quot;She sent a flier into my office and had a commando
team ready to move in after,&quot; Jack said simply,
&quot;though I think taking Motoko was a bonus. She still
hates that I got away from her way back when, offing
me would be a pleasure.&quot;

&quot;Lady sure knows how to nurse a grudge,&quot; she nodded to
a guard waiting beside the stairs. As they climbed
Milly said, &quot;Everyone goes armed in here, so I&#39;ll
issue your friends short swords.&quot;

&quot;What about Jack?&quot; Cole asked.

Milly barked a laugh, &quot;Trust me, Jack doesn&#39;t need
it.&quot;

As they exited onto the fourth floor Jack asked, &quot;So
who&#39;s running the Sisterhood now?&quot;

&quot;Bette,&quot; Milly said promptly as they walked by various
armed young women, &quot;you remember her, right Jack?&quot;

&quot;If you mean Becky Slay, yeah,&quot; Jack said with a grin,
&quot;was that a test?&quot;

&quot;We had a shapeshifter try to get in last year, he
nearly did damage before we caught him,&quot; Milly
grinned, &quot;seems better to check.&quot; She used a key to
open a metal case attached to the wall and drew out
two swords and sheathes, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

Motoko bucked the sword in place then drew, swinging
it smoothly. At their questioning looks she shrugged,
&quot;I&#39;ve done some kendo.&quot;

Cole was a bit more awkward with her blade then the
catgirl sheathed it with disgust. &quot;I think I&#39;ll stick
with my claws,&quot; the black furred catgirl admitted.

&quot;We&#39;ll stick you in a inner room,&quot; Milly said, &quot;and
I&#39;m sorry to say there&#39;s only two beds. I assume
you&#39;re all staying together, Jack?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not leaving Motoko and I don&#39;t trust Cole alone,&quot;
Jack answered dryly.

&quot;You wound me,&quot; Cole battered her eyes innocently.

Milly gave Cole a long, dangerous look. &quot;You know,&quot;
she finally said mildly, &quot;I&#39;m tempted to bring you
back to my rooms and cure that attitude of yours for
good.&quot; As Cole paled beneath her fur she continued,
&quot;But I think Jack&#39;d object.&quot;

&quot;That and I think Bannon wouldn&#39;t be happy getting her
back with strips taken out of her hide,&quot; Jack added.
She paused as they reached the door of the room they&#39;d
been assigned and said softly, &quot;Thanks, Milly.&quot;

&quot;Just fulfilling our charter,&quot; Milly waved it off as
she left, &quot;besides, we owe you.&quot;

The three went inside the small but comfortable room,
all of them breathing a sigh of relief. &quot;Did Milly
really mean that?&quot; Motoko asked, looking over at Cole
nervously as she sat down on the side of a bed.

&quot;Milly is not terribly vanilla in her sexuality,&quot; Jack
said a bit uncomfortably, &quot;and she likes to keep
submisives as slaves.&quot; With a grim smile she said, &quot;If
she really wanted to break someone, she probably
could.&quot;

Cole shivered visibly as she sat on the other bed,
&quot;You can not be serious.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes I am,&quot; Jack gave her a warning look, &quot;and keep
in mind that just because they&#39;re giving us sanctuary
it doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re safe from Milly. Mouth off
badly enough or do something to convince her you&#39;re a
threat and you could be a permanent resident in her
dungeon.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to stay in our room like a nice, quiet
little kitty cat,&quot; Cole gulped.

&quot;Why do I wonder,&quot; Motoko asked mildly, &quot;if you&#39;ve
made us jump out of the frying pan and into the fire?&quot;

&quot;The Sisterhood have some basic rules,&quot; Jack
explained, &quot;help protect the Tower if it&#39;s attacked,
don&#39;t take anyone&#39;s girlfriend without permission and
practice basic politeness. You do that and you&#39;ll be
fine.&quot;

&quot;Girlfriends,&quot; Cole echoed, &quot;you mean they&#39;re all
lesbians here?&quot;

&quot;Pretty much,&quot; Jack agreed from where she stood by
Motoko, &quot;or at least bisexual. No men allowed inside,
remember?&quot;

&quot;Do you think Rose will try something?&quot; Motoko changed
the subject.

&quot;I almost hope she would,&quot; Jack grinned, &quot;but she&#39;s
not that suicidal.&quot; She frowned, &quot;I just wonder what
the hell Davidson is doing?&quot;</pre>
