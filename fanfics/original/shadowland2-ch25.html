<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>Kima jumped to her feet upon seeing Alyson in Kris&#39;s arms, &quot;What 
happened to you?&quot; She inquired glancing over the girl&#39;s wounds, &quot;Did 
someone attack you?&quot; 

&quot;Not really.&quot; Alyson remarked with a nervous glance at Natalie.

&quot;What happened to Jessie?&quot; Natalie inquired curiously, spotting the dorm 
head on the sofa.

&quot;She had a breakdown.&quot; Kris explained dismally.

&quot;Head Mistress Melissa told her she is going to have to stay longer.&quot; 
Kima explained sadly, &quot;and that she was going to be removed as Dorm Head 
and she freaked out.&quot; 

Natalie glanced down at Jessica&#39;s sleeping form, &quot;I never thought of her 
to be the unstable type. I wonder why Head Mistress Melissa would 
replace her? She was Dorm Head for years.&quot; 

Kris lowered Alyson to an empty couch, &quot;She must have been hiding under 
a lot of masks.&quot; Kris explained straightening and stepping over to 
Jessica to look down at the girl, &quot;We only know how much is torturing 
our own minds. I mean we are all here for a reason, aren&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Yeah... I guess...&quot; Natalie remarked and glanced around the room, 
&quot;Where is Jenn?&quot; 

&quot;She left with Tanya.&quot; Kris explained unhappily. 

&quot;You let her leave?&quot; Natalie probed frantically, &quot;She was not in the 
state of mind to be alone.&quot; 

&quot;She insisted.&quot; Kris returned defensively, &quot;I couldn&#39;t stop her. She 
seemed rather angry and Jessica was throwing a fit in the office. What 
was I too do?&quot; She asked in a lost voice.

&quot;So you choose Jessica over Jenn then?&quot; Natalie inquired, giving Kris an 
icy glare.

&quot;She does not want me anymore.&quot; Kris stated miserably.

&quot;You really do not know her, do you?&quot; Natalie bluntly replied, &quot;She is 
struggling with her memories of you and Kim, so what do you do? You go 
to the next convenient thing. I thought you were better then that.&quot; She 
stated in disgust.

&quot;What would you know?&quot; Kris screamed in frustration, &quot;You do not 
understand the pain I have gone through for her. I spent a year at her 
side in that dream world of her&#39;s. I listened to her everyday and was 
there for her when she had no one, but she always was pulling back from 
me and the moment Kim shows up she is all ecstatic, it is like I don&#39;t 
even exist to her.&quot; Tears began to stream down her cheeks, &quot;Y...yet I... 
continued to love her even... even when she did not love me... even when 
she started to fall in love with her.&quot; She turned her eyes on Kima who 
shrunk deep in her seat next to Penny. 

&quot;Do not turn your anger on Kima!&quot; Natalie demanded angrily, &quot;You are the 
one who failed her and that is not Kima&#39;s fault. Have you ever thought 
about showing Jenn how you feel for her?&quot; 

Kris cringed as if she had been slapped, &quot;I...&quot; She glanced down at 
Jessica and then at her feet. 

&quot;You have been so busy feeling sorry for yourself that you didn&#39;t even 
notice how much she needs you.&quot; Natalie exclaimed disappointedly, &quot;I 
haven&#39;t seen you so much as kiss the girl since you came here. If you 
love her so much why don&#39;t you show her instead of hiding it so much.&quot;

Kris flopped heavily in the couch at Jessica&#39;s feet and stared at her 
hand then back to Natalie, &quot;You tell me. If the girl you loved suddenly 
forgot who you were. Forgot everything including the most intimate 
moments of your lives together. What would you do? Would you simply 
force yourself upon her and possibly shatter the innocent state her mind 
was in? Could you go near the girl knowing that she may despise you for 
causing her to remember all the nightmares from her past, for causing 
her to remember the pain? Could you do that?&quot; She pleaded to Natalie. 

&quot;I...&quot; Natalie glanced down at Alyson then to Kima and lowered her head, 
&quot;I do not know...&quot; 

&quot;I would.&quot; Kima replied meekly. 

&quot;You would?&quot; Kris blinked at the girl across the coffee table, &quot;You 
could risk all of that?&quot; 

Kima took a deep sigh and looked upon Penny&#39;s face, &quot;What difference 
would it make?&quot; She inquired lightly, &quot;Not approaching her you risk 
losing her and comforting her you risk the same. I would take comforting 
her and showing that she is loved. At least that way she knows she is 
not alone.&quot; She reached out to caress Penny&#39;s cheek, &quot;And if she were to 
take things badly I would stay at her side. Never leaving her no matter 
how difficult things got. We would struggle through everything together. 
Through the darkness and the light.&quot; She glanced around to see the 
others were staring at her and quickly glanced down at her hands, 
ashamed of her words, &quot;But that is just the thoughts of some insane 
reflection... I&#39;ll shut up now.&quot; She muttered timidly. 

&quot;How can you care so deeply for someone you only met?&quot; Alyson inquired, 
sceptical of the girl&#39;s feelings.

Kima gazed up at Alyson and gave a weak smile, &quot;You were in her mind. 
You did not feel it?&quot; She inquired searching Alyson&#39;s eyes. Kima closed 
her eyes as she recalled the feeling that overcame her when she entered 
Penny&#39;s room, &quot;The fear and loneliness along with a desire to be freed. 
To be rescued by her prince who would whisk her up in her arms and carry 
her away from the nightmares the haunt her. I tried to save Kim but I 
failed, maybe this time I can really help.&quot; She took a shaky breath and 
opened her eyes to study Penny&#39;s sleeping face, &quot;Maybe I can make things 
right instead of always destroying everything.&quot; She stated in almost a 
whisper.

Natalie crossed the room to Kima&#39;s side and set a hand upon the girl&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;Kima... you protected her as best you could.&quot; She stated 
softly, &quot;I know I would have done the same if I was there.&quot; 

Kima looked up into Natalie&#39;s eyes, &quot;Would you?&quot; She pleaded then stared 
down at her hands, &quot;Would you really be able to kill someone in order to 
protect her? I thought I would do anything to save Kim, but now I wonder 
if I really helped her or made things worse. I mean she hates me now 
more than ever. I can see the fear in her eyes. She does not trust me 
anymore and thinks I&#39;m a monster when I only wanted to help.&quot; Tears 
filled her eyes and she wrapped her arms around Natalie&#39;s waist, burying 
her face in Natalie&#39;s tummy, &quot;Everything would be fine if that man would 
stop invading in on my dreams.&quot; She shakily recalled, &quot;Every time we 
seemed to be having a peaceful life he had to show up and mess 
everything up. He killed Lauren and even tried to kill Jenn. Then he 
appeared again inside of Penny&#39;s dreams. What does he want with us?&quot; She 
inquired shakily. 

Natalie tilted her head in curiosity, &quot;What man?&quot;

Kima set her eyes on Natalie, &quot;Drake!&quot; She stated coldly with hatred 
burning within those fiery red eyes. 

Natalie&#39;s head snapped in Alyson&#39;s direction, &quot;Drake?&quot; She inquired 
staring down at the girl, &quot;Alyson?&quot; 

Kris glanced around in confusion, &quot;Wait! Who is Drake? And what does he 
have to do with Alyson?&quot; She inquired feeling left out of things. 

Natalie&#39;s eye narrowed as she watched Alyson sunk in her seat, &quot;He&#39;s 
Alyson&#39;s brother.&quot; Natalie explained through clenched teeth, &quot;A tall man 
who always wears a long white cloak and has wavy white hair. When he 
looks at you it feel like his eyes are burning through your mind as if 
he is in search of your darkest fears. If you&#39;ve seen him you would know 
what I mean.&quot; 

Kris shook her head, &quot;I can not believe this.&quot; She stated as she slumped 
back against the cushions and stared up at the ceiling, &quot;I had a feeling 
he did not belong there.&quot; 

&quot;You have seen him too?&quot; Natalie inquired anxiously, &quot;Where?&quot; 

&quot;Inside of Jenn&#39;s dreams.&quot; Kris replied with a sigh, &quot;He was at her 
house.&quot; 

&quot;What does he want?&quot; Natalie probed turning her attention back to Alyson 
who promptly shook her head. 

&quot;Do not look at me.&quot; Alyson remarked restlessly, &quot;He never told me what 
he was up to. He just asked me to get close to certain girls and...&quot; Her 
face grew long as she noticed the looks of doubt in the other girl&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;Come on... You do not think...&quot; She protested, &quot;I would never do 
anything to hurt any of you.&quot;

&quot;But you know something, don&#39;t you?&quot; Natalie demanded, &quot;Quit playing 
games Alyson. What does he want?&quot; 

Alyson let out a sigh, &quot;I only know that he is searching for a girl with 
red hair and red eyes.&quot; She explained. 

Natalie glared at her friend, &quot;You knew he was after Kim?!?&quot; She 
exclaimed frantically, &quot;How long have you known that?&quot; 

&quot;I did not know it was your friend he was after.&quot; Alyson explained 
nervously, &quot;He just told me to keep an eye on her and to tell him if I 
saw Jenn at school.&quot;

Kris abruptly leapt to her feet, &quot;I am going to find Jenn.&quot; She stated 
as she circled around the couches. 

Natalie hurried behind the girl, &quot;I&#39;m going with you.&quot; She stated 
eagerly. 

&quot;Wait!!&quot; Alyson struggled to her feet, &quot;I am coming too.&quot; 

Natalie spun on her heels and lightly pushed Alyson back to the couch, 
&quot;You are staying right here.&quot; She demanded, &quot;I still don&#39;t know if we 
can trust you.&quot; 

&quot;But...&quot; Alyson started to protest when her eyes fell upon Natalie&#39;s and 
she felt weak against those intense blue eyes. 

Natalie turned to Kima, &quot;Make sure she does not leave!&quot; She commanded, 
pointing at Alyson.

Kima nodded, &quot;Su... sure, Nat.&quot; She stammered uneasily. 

&quot;We will be right back.&quot; Kris stated as she stepped out the door, a few 
girls that had returned for lunch quickly stepped out of the way as 
Natalie pushed through the doors after Kris.

Alyson flopped back on the couch then glanced over at Kima, &quot;I guess you 
are loving this?&quot; She remarked miserably. 

&quot;Nope, I&#39;m just hoping they get to Jenn before your brother does.&quot; Kima 
stated not taking her eyes off the front doors.
