12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan,</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The clouds from yesterday haven’t cleared, and the rain
hasn’t let up. It should be noon about now but for all I can tell, the sky’s
the same as that of midnight. It’s so cold in my room that even several layers
of clothes won’t keep me from freezing to death. That’s the reason why I’m sitting
in the kitchen right at the moment, next to the roaring flame. In case you’re
wondering how I survived the snow and the horrible weather of this island in the
wintry seasons, Nikki-chan, the answer’s simple; the Priestess Fuyuu Kotonoha,
my beloved Koto-chan of course. When winter came, she would cast around the
Residential Area of the Shrine a Ward that would simulate the temperature of
any cool summer day. She isn’t here now, so sitting close to the fire is the
only thing I can think of that can warm me up. I wish she would come back soon.
Not because I need her to cast the spell, I’m just too lonely, and I miss her
too much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, my outburst of jealousy on that fateful day happened
to have melted the ice wall between us. The raven-haired girl no longer ignored
me. It’s the complete opposite. She smiled as soon as she saw me, and she
talked to me before I could open my mouth and speak. In time, we grew close
enough to each other that we got rid of the family name basis. She addressed me
as <i>Hikari-san</i>, and I called her <i>Koto-chan</i>, which made her miss a
step and almost fall the first time she heard. She then asked me in a wondering
voice why I didn’t use her whole first name. I explained honestly that I really
liked the way little Yamazaki Miyuki called her <i>Koto-nee-chan</i>, and that
her name sounded so much cuter that way. The Priestess only kept silent
afterwards, face red enough to shame the setting sun. You know what, Nikki-chan;
I sometimes found her mumbling that nickname quietly with a little smile on her
lips. I guess that means she liked it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The closer to Koto-chan I became, the more deeply I fell in
love with her, the more I neglected my own room, and the more I stayed in hers.
She has always welcomed me so warmly that she often left the door open for me
unless she was changing clothes or didn’t want to be disturbed. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, you probably wonder what I could have found
interesting enough in her room that I stayed in there all day and refused to
return to mine until the other girl prepared to go to sleep. Well, you see,
when I told you in the beginning that with Koto-chan by my side, I never found
sadness or boredom where we lived, I meant it. I think it has something to do
with the fact that I could rarely take my eyes off of the raven-haired girl. Even
the slightest shift of her mood or the smallest gesture of her hand fascinated
me. When I looked at her, I completely lost my grip on time. Sitting in her
room, some place where I could study her without being too obvious, sometimes I
got the feeling that a day was shorter than a heartbeat.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>You know ne, Nikki-chan, Koto-chan really loved books, which
filled shelf after shelf under various headings and subjects. To me, who had
never willingly read more than three books in my entire life, her room was a
library. While many books on the shelves gave me dizzying headaches – <i>A
Brief History of the Tokugawa Shogunate</i>, ugh, for instant – some were very
pleasant. I liked the <i>Tale of Genji</i>, and for a book half a hand in
thickness, it was unbelievable that I didn’t put it back down after reading the
first few pages. Well, I had some troubles digesting its content, in fact – the
poetry aspect of the novel and the way the author described people tripped me
up often – but Koto-chan was there to answer any question I had.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, probably the reason why I liked the novel so much
was because it gifted me with an excuse to sit next to the raven-haired girl
and see her long, slender finger flickering upon the pages, showing me what one
sentence or another meant. She was so good at that she could best any teacher
in town. Her explanation was clear, to the point, and easy to understand. Of
course, her sweet, melodious voice only served to make the book much more
interesting.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As it turned out, the <i>Tale of Genji</i> was one of
Koto-chan’s all time favorite books. She told me that she had read it at least
a dozen times since its purchase a few years back. She even asked if she could
read it with me once. Not that I had any intention of refusing her, but the
Gods of Heaven standing witness, if the owner of that pair of obsidian eyes
told me to slit my throat, I’d gladly comply.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Anyways….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>During that time, Koto-chan sat next to me in front of the
table, upon which the opened book lay, her full attention placed on the pages.
Nikki-chan, while nothing could have made me happier than having the
raven-haired girl at my side, reading the same book, it did have its side
effect. You know, it was painfully hard to concentrate being fully aware that
the girl I had a serious crush on was close enough for me to breath in her
fragrant scent, to put my arm around her shoulder, or my hand on the hollow of
her waist. Her cheeks, all but a few inches away from mine, were so inviting
all I wanted was to kiss her and never stop. Of course, I spent so much time
ogling her as a result that I never paid a scrap of attention to the book. When
she asked me what I thought about it afterwards, I found myself at a loss for
words. Thankfully, Koto-chan took me silence for tiredness, so she dropped the
question. I was infinitely relieved.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Since Koto-chan and I became close friends, I had plenty of
chances to learn more about her. You know ne, Nikki-chan; the raven-haired girl
wore a mask to conceal her true personality when she dealt with the townsfolk.
With it on, she appeared elegance incarnate, the very embodiment of serenity,
and sometimes the personification of death. She brimmed with power and
confidence, which she wielded as naturally as she would her own limbs. When she
asked people to do something, they did it, and the one who challenged her authority
would somehow find themselves obeying her afterwards while wishing from the
bottom of their hearts that they had listened in the first place. You know what
the funny thing about this is, Nikki-chan? Koto-chan never thought of it in
that sense. To her, those “<i>commands</i>” were simply reasonable <i>suggestions</i>
only the dimwitted failed to heed. The raven-haired girl claimed that eighteen
years of being brought up in the <i>Grand Shrine of Ise</i> had given her that
kind of attitude. My response was, “Yeah, right.” She blushed. I just loved it
when she did that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At least when Koto-chan ordered people around, it was for
their own good, not hers. She wasn’t the least bit in the wrong when she told
the weaver to quit dumping her excess dyes into the river, or when she berated
the mailman, whose horse almost trampled on an elderly lady because he kept his
eyes on the pretty women instead of the road. And the butcher certainly
deserved it when she stared him down with her obsidian eyes for his negligence
over his own children, who wandered into Kagemori Forest all on their own.
Luckily, Koto-chan found them before they had a chance to fall down some cliff
and break their neck.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The mask she discarded and her true self she revealed only
when she was around people who had earned her affection and trust, like the
Yamazaki Family… and me. In those times, she turned into a shy, sensitive, but
absolutely adorable nineteen-year-old girl who liked to talk about books, read
poetry, and practice the sword. Most surprisingly… she was also a girl who has
a strange obsession over food. You know ne, Koto-chan doesn’t look it… but she’s
a glutton. She never missed a meal, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and
every time I walked past the shoji door to her room, I would see a dish full of
snacks on her table, within her arm’s reach. The incredible thing was that
although she must have gulped down tons of food every week, she never seemed to
gain a fraction of a pound in weight. I bet any girl would kill to have such a fine
metabolism. <i>I</i> would kill for it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Another funny thing about my Koto-chan and her being a
glutton. You see, Nikki-chan, there was this one time where I was sitting next
to her in her room. On the table was a dishful of <i>odango</i> balls, which
she told me to have as much as I liked. We started talking, and I was about to
say the punch line of a joke I heard in town when I suddenly noticed a change
in her expression. I stared in somewhat of a mild shock at her, who was staring
up at me pleadingly with large, teary puppy eyes that were too cute to describe
with words. At which point, I realized that I had taken the last <i>odango</i>
ball from the dish….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Koto-chan,” I asked, “do you… um… want this?” I asked, to
which the raven-haired girl nodded immediately and most emphatically. I guessed
she did it before she knew what she was doing, because she froze midway through
the third nod and started to chew on her lips while blushing furiously. No one
could have imagined that the same girl had just scared the heck out of the butcher
the day before.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Of course, I could have just handed her the odango and let
her have it… but I didn’t. Instead, I held the rice ball in front of her mouth
and said, “Say ‘<i>ah’</i>, Koto-chan.” How the raven-haired girl had been
startled hearing that from me and realizing that I had offered to feed her with
my own hand. Given her shy nature, I thought she would back down; I thought she
would tell me to stop teasing her….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>She didn’t do any of that. The girl simply closed her eyes
and opened her mouth expectantly. During the next two minutes or so, I held the
<i>odango</i> with my slightly trembling hand while Koto-chan munched on the
snack. In the end, the thing vanished completely into her mouth… but not before
her soft, warm lips engulfed the tips of my fingers. I felt as if steams were
coming out of my ears. I lied to her that I was kinda sleepy and hurried back
to my room afterwards. That night, I held that very hand close to my mouth and
giggled myself to sleep.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> Koto-chan’s just too cute, don’t you think?</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>On a different topic, I stopped disliking Yamazaki Shizuka. There
are two reasons for that. Firstly, I don’t really have an excuse to feel
hostile toward her. After all, she was about to move far away, unable to pester
the one I love perhaps for one or two decades. Secondly, I’ve grown somewhat
sympathetic to her, I guess. You see, Nikki-chan, I realized that if I myself
found Koto-chan irresistible, that I constantly felt the need to hold her,
touch her, and kiss her, Shizuka must have, too. I think she was merely
expressing her emotions to the raven-haired girl instead of holding back the
way I did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'> About a week before the day the merchant’s family moved to
Nagano, Koto-chan and I had a sorta… embarrassing discussion about her. It
started when the raven-haired girl announced that she was going to escort the
Yamazaki to the nearest seaport.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Can I go with you, Koto-chan?” I said.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I am sorry, Hikari-san,” she answered, shaking her head. “I
will need you to stay here and manage the Shrine.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s just two days!” I insisted. “And it’s not like I’m
going to be of much help if someone comes to me and asks for an exorcism
anyway.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Sorry, but no,” the raven-haired girl said firmly. “The
Yamazaki do not think very well of you, in case you have forgotten. Bringing
you will create more trouble than I can manage.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I promise I’ll behave, Koto-chan!” I pleaded. “In fact, I
won’t say a word to them unless you give me permission. So let me come along, please!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why are you so adamant about this, Hikari-san?” Koto-chan
gave me an odd, quizzical look and asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It’s going to be really boring in the <i>Jinja</i> without
you,” I told her, and received an amused chuckle in return. Well, I couldn’t
really confess to her truthfully that I only wished to be by her side, look at
her face, and simply hear her talk. I couldn’t predict what she would make out
of it. And I didn’t want her to assume that I was just another Yamazaki
Shizuka, who was hell-bent on chasing after her skirt. “Besides, don’t you need
me to reinforce that lover’s act in front of the Yamazaki?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh come on,” Koto-chan said exasperatedly. “She is going to
leave for a faraway place and may never come back. No need for that now.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I think you tell me to stay home because you don’t want an
obstacle between you and Yamazaki Shizuka,” I muttered. “Are you planning to
make out with her in the carriage or something?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You talked as if I <i>liked</i> kissing her, Hikari-san.”
The raven-haired girl sighed. “Contrary to what you may choose to believe, I do
<i>not</i>.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why?” I asked curiously. “I’ve overheard lots of men in town
saying how much they’d like to smooch her.” The men might have some qualms
about Yamazaki Shizuka liking girls, but that didn’t really stop them from
ogling her or wanting her all to themselves. The merchant’s daughter, after
all, was pretty much a beauty.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“They do not know how it felt to kiss her,” Koto-chan said
dryly. “For your information, it is no difference from touching water with your
lips. Wet, and utterly bland.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Did you feel the same way when you kissed me?” Words poured
from my mouth before I had any chance to snap it shut. The Priestess, startled
by the strange question, stared at me while her complexion grew darker and
darker by the minute. “I... I’m just… curious,” I added hastily.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well… if you must know…” Koto-chan said slowly, obsidian
eyes downcast, face crimson, and forefingers drawing circles around one
another. “Your lips were softer, sweeter, and you were cuddlier than she was…
so… I... rather liked it.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Um… thanks,” I murmured happily while flame raged on my
cheeks.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“But as I was saying,” the raven-haired cleared her throat
and changed the topic. “I cannot take you with me, and that is final.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You don’t enjoy my company?” I mumbled in a sad voice.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I do! I really do!” Koto-chan assured me frantically. “That
is the problem, Hikari-san; I enjoy your company too much. When I am with you,
I tend to lose focus on the surrounding. That, evidently, is not something I
desire when I escort the Yamazaki through Sengimori Forest. They can get hurt.
Worse, <i>you</i> can get hurt. I... do not want that.” She put her hand atop
mine at the end of the sentence. It was very warm.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“If you say so, Koto-chan, I’ll stay home,” I murmured.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Thank you for your understanding.” The raven-haired girl
smiled sweetly at me.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, as you can see, I couldn’t have been any happier
living with my housemate. The bliss never seemed to end. It did. The very next
day from that conversation, a revelation took me from the highest cloud in
Heaven and dropped me to the deepest layer of Hell.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Early in that morning, Koto-chan received a dove carrying an
urgent-marked message. The moment the raven-haired girl finished reading it,
her expression turned grim. She told me that a child in town required her
immediate attention and that I should prepare to leave for Unomichi with her as
soon as possible. On our way through Kagemori Forest, Koto-chan explained more
about the situation. It appeared that the nine-year-old Nakayama Kohaku, only
child to the woodcutter Nakayama Sousuke and his wife Meiko, two days before
had just suddenly collapsed. Reasons unknown. All the woodcutter could tell was
that the boy was suffering from a dangerously high fever, and no doctors in
Unomichi could relieve him of it.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A curse of demonic origin,” the raven-haired girl declared flatly
after a few minutes of examining little Kohaku, who was lying upon his bed in
his room, whose reddened body was drenched with sweat as though he had just
taken a bath. He appeared to be sleeping, but his breathing was uneven, and his
skin could have been fire. “An exceptionally strong and malignant one at that.”
Koto-chan’s voice was grave, her face hard. Behind her, Nakayama Meiko gasped
in shock while her husband stared unblinkingly at the floor beneath his feet.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why’s he infected with that, Koto-chan?” I asked.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I do not know,” the raven-haired girl said grimly. “But I
intend to find out.” She turned to the woodcutter. “Sousuke-san, when did the
sickness strike little Kohaku?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Early this morning… Kotonoha-sama,” Sousuke mumbled. “When I...
came into his room to wake him up for school, he was… already like this.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What did he do before he went to bed last night?” Koto-chan added,
“In fact, give me a full account on what he could have done yesterday.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Well, he went to school in the morning, came back ‘round
after noon, and did homework in this room…” he hesitated. “I think.” The man
gave a start at the Priestess’s unnerving gaze. “I had to go to the next town
in the evening so I... I didn’t know what he did after I left!” he explained hurriedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“He went out to play with friends from his class, Kotonoha-sama,”
Nakayama Meiko said. The middle-aged woman gave a start and gripped the front
of her clothes when Koto-chan’s obsidian eyes swiveled to her face.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I... I don’t know.” The woodcutter’s wife gave a frantic
shake of her head. “I was… taking care of the house chores at that time.” Koto-chan’s
eyebrows drew lower, annoyance evident on her cold face. She was rather upset,
of course. You see, Nikki-chan, my housemate adores kids. She has always been
so excessively protective over them that she generally blamed the parents without
stopping to think whether it was their fault. The reason for that was because
Koto-chan’s own mom and dad abandoned her shortly after she was born. Had it
not been for the High Priestess of <i>Ise</i> who found her and brought her up in
the Grand Shrine….</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nakayama Meiko didn’t need Koto-chan to say it a second time;
she already scurried out of the door as soon as the raven-haired girl finished.
The atmosphere in the room became decidedly awkward after that, with Koto-chan
sitting on her knees by little Kohaku’s futon, gently ruffling the spiky hair
on his head while I stood next to his father, whose feet seemed to have been
set on fire by the occasional glances the Priestess threw his way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>About half an hour had passed before Nakayama Meiko returned.
“Kohaku visited the Demon Cemetery, Kotonoha-sama,” she announced breathlessly.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The Demon Cemetery’s the square of land beyond the Eastern
Gate of Unomichi, where the remains of the demons slain by the Priestess were
buried, each having their own respective grave. I once asked the raven-haired
girl why people would care so much about their natural enemies that they would
made them graves.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i>“Practical reasons again, no more, no less,” </i>my
housemate explained dryly.<i> “Those demons I felled died bearing a grudge
against me and the townsfolk. I can care less about those pretty grudges, as my
being a Priestess shield me from their influences. However, the people are
powerless and vulnerable. That was why they made graves for the demons, hoping
that they can ease their anger and escape their wrath.” </i>It does make sense.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What?” the raven-haired girl snapped. Her obsidian pupils
were augers colder than ice and harder than iron. The husband gave a start that
nearly lifted him off the ground. I am not sure whether it was because of the
news or because of Koto-chan’s murderous mood, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“His friends said they were playing hide-and-seek last
night.” Meiko swallowed audibly as she took a small step away from my
housemate. “My son told his friends afterwards that he had been hiding in the
Cemetery the whole time.”</p>

girl’s voice was hard, harsh, and it made the rest of her icy face seem warm
and friendly. </p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Fine,” Koto-chan said angrily. “He shall hear from me later.
Thanks to him, Kohaku may just become the first patient I do not know how to
save.” Both the child’s mom and dad went wide-eyed at the statement. Horrified,
Nakayama Meiko clutched at her mouth with her hands, appearing about to faint
dead. Her husband was made of tougher material; he only grunted and looked at
his son worriedly. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes.” She nodded. “I can destroy the curse, but that would
mean casting high-level spells on little Kohaku. The only problem is that he is
too young, his body too frail, to endure the process. I will end up killing him
even <i>before</i> the curse could.” The raven-haired girl let out a deep,
exasperated sigh. “I have been trying to think of a solution for a while now.
Unfortunately, none that came to mind would work.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

the woodcutter mutter under his breath.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Am I... going to… die?” a young voice said. We never noticed
that Kohaku had regained consciousness. The boy was looking at us, fright plain
in his teary eyes. He seemed to have heard what we said. “I don’t… want to
die…” he mewled. “My parents will be sad… my friends will be sad….”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Kohaku-chan….” Nakayama Meiko knelt down next to her son and
took his small hand into both of hers. She was sobbing uncontrollably. The
woodcutter seemed about to, too. Even my eyes stung hearing those words.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

her hands ruffling his head. “I will save you no matter what. Now, would you
tell me what you have done in the Cemetery?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“T… the newest… one.” The raven-haired girl gave no sign that
she was surprised. Nikki-chan, I think she already knew before Kohaku answered.
She asked just because she wanted to confirm her suspicion.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I happened to know the demon to whom that grave belonged. It
had been a spider disguised as a pretty woman, who was walking past the
Southern Gate when <i>Seinaru Suishou</i> chimed loudly and alerted the
Priestess. I knew why she tried to enter Unomichi, as my dad used to tell me
about all sorts of tales concerning how his demonic brethren behaved. You know
ne, Nikki-chan, spider demons, especially the female ones, had a voracious
appetite for men. What they would usually do was put on human’s flesh, come
into some village or town, and then entice the men away with their beauty. Men
being men, lustful creatures that refused to be sated, didn’t resist the
spiders very well. No one would ever see them again.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The demon from the day prior to our arrival at the
woodcutter’s residence didn’t have time to do what she planned. The townsfolk
knew she was suspicious, for no other person was walking through the Southern
Gate, so they ran away from her as soon as <i>Seinaru Suishou</i> started
ringing. When my housemate and I found her – we happened to be in town that day
– the woman was standing in the middle of an empty street with an utterly
confused look on her face. That look was replaced by fear, tinged by envy, the
moment she laid eyes upon my beloved Koto-chan. The demon realized that she had
just been confronted by a Priestess, so she reverted into her true form, a
monstrously huge black spider, immediately. Too bad, a sacred flame springing
from the raven-haired girl’s hand reduced the demon to a heap of blackened
bones before she could twitch.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I... I see a… lady there, nee-chan,” Kohaku said, his eyes
hazy, his voice weak, his entire body aflame. “She asked… what I was doing. I
told her… I... was playing hide-and-seek and begged her… not to tell my friends
where… I... was. She smiled… and said that she wouldn’t. Then she went… away.”</p>

demanded, accusation plain in his raised voice. “Why is the demon still
alive?!”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She is not,” Koto-chan said coolly, obsidian eyes boring at
the man who dared talk to her in such a disrespectful way. The woodcutter shied
back. “What your son saw in the Cemetery was but her spirit. She still lingered
in this world because of her thirst for revenge. That was the reason why she
cast a curse upon Kohaku, hoping he would die a slow, painful death. If this
continues, her wish would come true, and Kohaku would rot alive.” Anger coursed
violently in her voice.</p>

shoulders and shook them, screaming. The raven-haired girl only sighed deeply.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“So… the only problem’s that Kohaku’s frail body can’t endure
the intensity of the spells you need to cast, right, Koto-chan?” I asked.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes.” My housemate nodded and gave me a quizzical look.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Then is it possible to transfer the curse to another person
who has a stronger body? Like me?” I offered.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>At first, the raven-haired girl stared at me while not saying
a word. Then slowly, she nodded and said, “Yes.” Had the child’s mom and dad
been drowning at sea, the sight of a rescue boat still couldn’t have made them
any happier than that single word. In fact, they were jumping up and down in
joy.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“I will transfer the curse, but not to you, Hikari-san.”
Nakayama Sousuke and Meiko suddenly became deathly still. From the horror that
was creeping across their pale faces, I’d say that they were afraid that my
housemate would pick either of them. I was right, for they became infinitely
relieved when Koto-chan spoke, “I will take it myself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No!” The raven-haired girl’s obsidian eyes began to gather
so much heat I thought that should I keep looking into them they would scorch
me into dust. “I shall not put <i>you</i> in harm’s way. <i>EVER</i>!” then she
turned toward the panting Kohaku on the bed, leaving me standing there,
speechless. No, Nikki-chan, I wasn’t angry despite the fact that it had been
the first time she raised her voice with me. On the contrary, I was so happy I
wished the Nakayama couple would go away just so I could pull Koto-chan into a
hug. The raven-haired girl’s words were harsh, but the meaning behind them was
unmistakable. She would rather put herself in danger instead of letting me take
risk. There could be no joy greater than hearing the one I loved saying that.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

leave the center clear,” the raven-haired girl commanded, which we obeyed with
great alacrity.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>As soon as an empty area of at least five feet in radius was
formed, Koto-chan raised her right hand and intoned, “<i>Guardian of the Storms
and Winds, come forth, Sennen no Inori</i>.” In a powerful flash of light, the
transparent-bladed sword materialized in the room, its prickly tip hovering a
good hand above the tatami mat. <i>A Thousand Years of Prayers </i>was as
impressive and seemingly powerful as ever.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>All of a sudden, winds rose in the room, and little Kohaku’s
body began lifting off his futon as though grabbed by an invisible hand. The
child then stood vertically in midair, his front facing <i>Sennen no Inori</i>
and the Priestess Fuyuu Kotonoha. Eyes closed, the raven-haired girl raised her
hand once more, her movement mirrored by the woodcutter’s son to the smallest
detail. The sacred sword started to glow.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Cut,” my housemate said. A flash of light emerging from the
sword opened a wound on Koto-chan’s hand, and another, little Kohaku’s. No
blood came trickling out as anyone would expect, though.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Liquefy.” At the raven-haired girl’s command, the
transparent blade of <i>Sennen no Inori</i> turned into water, which then split
into two streams joined at the hilt of the sword, each engulfing a hand.
Nikki-chan, <i>Sennen no Inori</i> in truth is a Water Sword. As a result, its
blade possessed a sharpness not even that of the best man-made razor could
match. If you put a strand of hair along the edge of <i>Sennen no Inori</i> and
breathed on it, that very strand would be split cleanly into two. If you pointed
the sword downward at the toughest paved road in Unomichi and then let go, <i>Sennen
no Inori</i> would drive through it like through paper until all you saw
afterwards was its hilt.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Also, being a magically wrought Water Sword, it has another
powerful ability other than being able to liquefy at will. You know ne,
Nikki-chan, <i>Sennen no Inori</i> can gather the moisture from the air to
extend its length as far as its wielder wished. That was how the Priestess
Fuyuu Kotonoha could stand in one place the very night I first met her in my <i>kitsune</i>
<i>youkai</i> form and still managed to hurt me. You understand now, don’t you,
why Kugimiya Karasu wants the thing so much? I doubt the demon’s father,
Kugimiya Ryuha, however mighty he may be, would stand a chance against the
sacred <i>goshintai</i> of <i>Furisame Jinja</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Draw,” Koto-chan muttered. As if it was a summons, a liquid
blacker than ink wormed out from within the wound on Kohaku’s palm. I didn’t
have to be a genius to be able to guess that it was the materialized form of
the curse the spider demon had cast upon the child in her hope for vengeance.
The liquid then swam along the current of <i>Sennen no Inori</i> and finally
arrived at the wound on my Koto-chan’s palm. It rushed inside.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Cease,” the word came out a snap. The wounds closed their
mouths, the water withdrew into <i>Sennen no Inori</i>’s original sword form,
and the sword vanished. Koto-chan’s expression went a trifle gray.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>“Kohaku-chan! Kohaku-chan!” Nakayama Meiko called as she
rushed to her son, who had been lowered back down to his bed. “Are you
alright?” the boy didn’t answer her, but it was clear that his condition had
improved vastly. He was no longer sweating within an inch of his life, his
breathing stabilized, and the red color slowly fading from his complexion. I
didn’t doubt for a second that he was beyond death’s reach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Ignoring the overjoyed Nakayama couple, we left the house.
Ignoring the townsfolk who went wide-eyed at their usually self-possessed
Kotonoha-sama, beautiful face grim, hand dragging her utterly confused
assistant, we hurried toward the Northern Gate, where Kagemori welcomed us into
its sacred shade and a labyrinth’s worth of winding roads. Midway through the
Forest of Shadows, the raven-haired girl missed a step and collapsed onto all
four. Her obsidian eyes were wide open, her complexion reddening, and her whole
body trembling above the grassy ground as though a tree caught in an
earthquake.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

okay?”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The curse… it is affecting me,” my housemate mumbled as she
struggled to rise back on her feet. “Come, we must return to the Shrine before
it is too late.” She fell down again, this time flat on her stomach.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Not saying a word, I took her limp body into my arms and
started to run as if hell was on my heels. Yet, worried about her condition as
I was, I still could notice that it was getting worse. Koto-chan was sweating
profusely, her temperature growing so rapidly in so short a time that one
moment I was holding a warm human body, the next I was holding something almost
as hot as burning coals. Her eyes were only half opened, yet the brilliant
gleam I usually saw in them had vanished, leaving all but a dull black color
belonging to the eyes of the dead. The mighty Priestess Fuyuu Kotonoha had
become exactly the same as Nakayama Kohaku, the child whose life she saved. I
was scared witless, but the more so I was, the faster I ran, the more fervently
I hoped I could reach <i>Furisame Jinja </i>in time.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>All of a sudden, I felt her soft, searing-hot hand on my cheek,
touching it in such an affectionate way that anyone could have thought I was
her lover. Then slowly, Koto-chan shifted her body in my arm so she could wrap
her arms around my neck. My mind went blank as I felt her breath caressing the
skin on my cheek, as I saw her lips drawing nearer and nearer to mine. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I tripped on a rock – or perhaps a fallen tree branch, I
wasn’t quite sure – so I lost my balance and fell. Although Koto-chan caught me
by surprise, there was enough sense left in me to realize that a forward fall
would hurt the girl I loved, who was hugging me in a way that tied my tongue in
a knot and made my heart pound hard enough to rival any stroke of a
blacksmith’s hammer. Before the fall lifted my feet into the air, I used all
the strength I had to pull my head away from the raven-haired girl, pressed her
against my chest, and then turned my body so my back instead of my front slammed
painfully upon the ground afterwards. Darkness decorated by colorful stars
blanketed my vision while a terrible pain rippled across my whole self. Had the
air not been driven out of my lungs already, I would have screamed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When the darkness dissipated from my eyes, I found my beloved
companion lying atop my body, her face hovering an inch above my own, her hands
lacing tightly in mine, pinning them to the ground on either side of my head.
She was breathing heavily, and I could feel the intense heat radiating from her
reddened skin. I wanted to push her off of me so I could take her into my arms
again and hurried back to <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. Eyes closed, lips slightly
opened, she lowered her mouth to mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, despite the fact that I had always wanted to feel
the raven-haired girl’s lips once more ever since I discovered that I had
fallen head over heels in love with her, I found no joy and pleasure in seeing
her wanting to kiss me so desperately on that fateful day. Why would I, when I
was fully aware that she wasn’t herself all the while? Why would I, when I knew
that it was her wretched fever that controlled her body? The Koto-chan I know
and love wouldn’t try to kiss me by force, and I am not so low that I would
attempt to take advantage of her for my own selfish gain. That was the reason
why I struggled to keep her lips off of mine.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>My efforts didn’t manage to daunt the raven-haired in the
beginning, though. It only made her try ever more fiercely to capture my lips,
which gave me one hell of a time trying to stop her by constantly turning my face.
After a long while of playing hide-and-seek with my mouth, Koto-chan gave up. I
thought she would get off of me. She didn’t. To my horror, she wrapped her arms
around my neck, buried her lovely face in my bosom, and wept as hard as she
could. Her voice, drenched with sorrow, soaked in tears, echoed loudly in
Kagemori Forest. I only stared at her then, sensing my heart being ripped apart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why… why will you not kiss me?” the other girl sobbed.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why do you not accept my feelings, Hikari? Why will you not
love me back?” came the muffled questions that upturned my stomach. Never once
before did she address me with my plain name. Prior to that day, she only
appeared a caring friend and a kind housemate but the emotions overflowing from
her words at that moment clearly proved to me that she saw me as nothing else
but a lover. Nikki-chan, instead of being filled to the brim with happiness, a
terribly feeling I couldn’t name placed its cold hand around my heart. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You’re delirious, Koto-chan,” I said, my hands gently pushed
her away from me so I could sit up straight. “I must….” She didn’t let me
finish.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“NO!” She threw her arms around my back and hugged me tightly
as she wept furiously into my shoulder, her tears seeping into the fabrics. “Please!
Do not leave me on my own again, I beg of you!” </p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m not going anywhere, Koto-chan,” I whispered breathlessly
into her ear while my hands traveled up and down her back, trying to ease her
crying. She didn’t seem to have heard me, for she only tightened her grip. I really
wanted to yell out in pain.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I love you so much, Hikari,” the raven-haired girl wept “Ever
since you left <i>Ise Grand Shrine</i>, my life had become worse than death.
But now the Gods have brought you back to me, they had rekindled my hope…. So
please…. Stay by my side forever. I cannot live without you anymore… Hikari….”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The heartfelt confession struck me like a slap across my face.
Another girl would probably be happy enough to die right then and there, but
Nikki-chan, all I felt was bleakness and raging jealousy. It wasn’t <i>me</i>
Koto-chan claimed she loved. It wasn’t me she was speaking to. It was the <i>real</i>
Amano Hikari, the person I’m masquerading as under Kugimiya Karasu’s command.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Arms dropped to my sides, I was at a loss for words. Meanwhile,
Koto-chan never stopped crying until the fatigue and the fever defeated her and
rendered her unconscious. She passed out with her head resting on my shoulder, face
contorted in grief, tears still leaking from the corners of her eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Knowing that I must not hesitate, I took her back into my
arms and dashed toward the Shrine of the Falling Rain. Before long, I passed
beneath the Torii Archway marking the territory of <i>Furisame Jinja</i>. It
was only then did the raven-haired girl <i>truly</i> regain her consciousness.
Nikki-chan, I don’t think it was a coincidence. The Sacred Barrier protecting the
Shrine must have exerted some positive influence on the girl’s body and
temporarily disrupted the devastating influence of the curse.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

“There lies… the cure.”</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>In less than five minutes, we arrived at the <i>Honden</i> –
the Inner Sanctuary – of <i>Furisame</i>, a minute building only as large as my
own room that was placed at the end of the gable-roofed portico connecting the four
main buildings of the <i>Jinja</i>. Nikki-chan, the Sanctuary is where the <i>goshintai</i>
of the Shrine, <i>A Thousand Years of Prayers</i>, rests. The first time the
Priestess took me there several months ago, I knew immediately that what
Kugimiya Karasu wanted was hiding beyond those little wooden doors that weren’t
even locked. Well, true, it seemed a piece of cake just to push them open and
take the sword, you might think. Wrong. Instead of locks, the <i>Honden’s</i>
protected by a Barrier that denies physical contacts. There’s no way in hell I
could get in.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Put me… in front of the entrance,” Koto-chan said. I did as
she wanted me to. I helped her to sit up straight in a prim <i>seiza</i>
fashion then moved out of her way.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>The raven-haired girl’s right hand rose, the tip of her long,
slender finger alight. Slowly, she used it as a brush to draw strange glowing shapes
that formed vertical line after vertical line in the air while her mouth moved
soundlessly, probably reciting sacred chants. All of a sudden, a white dome of
light materialized over the sacred Inner Sanctuary. It was the
physical-repelling barrier I told you earlier, Nikki-chan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Open,” Koto-chan breathed as her hand plowed forward. The
glowing lines blazed, a deafening sound erupted, and the Barrier was gone. The
doors to the Honden swung open, revealing what lay beyond. Lying horizontally
on a wooden altar was the glowing shape of the sacred sword <i>Sennen no Inori,
</i>above which was a length of wood lacquered in white, a scabbard I never
knew existed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Awaken, <i>Sennen no Koe</i>,” my housemate said weakly. She
had to use both of her hands to support her body then. Light flared from within
the Inner Sanctuary in a humongous pillar of light that enveloped the
raven-haired girl in a heartbeat. Then just as quickly as it had emerged, it
was gone. The doors to the <i>Honden</i> drew shut in a loud, dry crack.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

side.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The danger has already passed, Hikari-san,” she smiled
gently at me. “The curse has been lifted.” I heaved a sigh of relief. Looking
at her, who seemed at the prime of her life, healthy and strong, none would
have believed that she was so sick she couldn’t even walk on her own just
moments ago. Still, despite the fact that my worries about her condition had
departed, my heart was still heavier than a chunk of rocks, and my head buzzing
with suspicions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

head a light shake.</p>

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“<i>Sennen no Koe</i>,” Koto-chan answered while using the
wide sleeve of her robe to dry the sweat on her face. “The second <i>goshintai</i>
of <i>Furisame Jinja</i>, the object that maintains the Sacred Barrier around
our Shrine, and the scabbard to <i>Sennen no Inori</i> itself.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How did an object capable of making a Barrier remove the
curse for you?” I said, puzzled.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“It is quite simple.” The raven-haired girl rose gracefully
to her feet. “<i>Sennen no Koe</i> created a Barrier within my body and trapped
the curse within its clutches. Like this.” She raised her hand to her side,
palm upward. A glowing white sphere – centered by another, pitch black and only
half the size – leapt up and suspended itself in the air. Then the outer sphere
grew smaller and smaller, forcefully shrinking the black one within as it went,
while Koto-chan’s fingers bent steadily inward. The instant their tips touched
her palm was also the instant both spheres exploded in a brilliant flash of
light. “<i>Sennen no Koe</i> obliterated the curse in pretty much same way.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;

text-indent:.5in'>“Thank you, Hikari-san.” My companion suddenly pulled me into
her arms. “Without you, I fear my life would have been forfeited. So thank you.”
Normally, I would have blushed myself to death in her arms. I would have even
hugged her back and enjoyed the soft, cuddly body of the one I so dearly
cherished. Yet, at that time, I only felt bitter… and strangely empty inside my
heart.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes?” She gave me a little smile that did nothing to improve
my mood. I tried to smile back but managing anything other than a quirk of my
mouth’s corners was beyond any effort. The raven-haired girl blinked at me, slightly
taken aback.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:

text-indent:.5in'>“It must be my imagination, then. I’m… sorry, but I was
rather tired, so I’ll retire to my room and rest. Good night, Koto-chan.”
Before she could say anything, I ran off and spent the rest of the day hiding
beneath the blanket of my futon, trembling and crying in silence. Koto-chan
came in my room a few times but I pretended to be fast asleep and ignored her.
She sighed and left.</p>

escort the Yamazaki family through Sengimori Forest and to the port. I woke up
early to see her off, acting normally as though nothing had happened the day
before. I even gave her a smile, however tight and forced, when she waved to me
one last time beneath the Torii Archway before she vanished into Kagemori
Forest. She wasn’t exactly happy, though, and she appeared to have spent the
whole previous night awake.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Later in the afternoon, when I was sure that the raven-haired
girl and the Yamazaki family had already departed, I crossed Kagemori and went
straight to the office of the Mayor. Sadamoto Shun'ichi was shocked to see me,
and his eyes seemed more than ready to fall out of his face when he heard my
demand to see Kugimiya Karasu. He tried to talk me out of it. He very nearly
swallowed his own tongue when I threatened to reveal his involvement with
Karasu should he refuse to do what I wanted.</p>

text-indent:.5in'>Dear Nikki-chan, of course I had known from the very start
that Koto-chan was lying when she said she had mistaken me for someone else. I
was fully aware that she must have realized who I, or rather the girl to whom
my face belonged, was before I came to in the Colonization Office. I hadn’t
given much it thought firstly because I didn’t <i>love</i> Koto-chan in the
beginning, and secondly because once I <i>did</i>, I became too infatuated with
her to remember anything except her smiling face. After what had happened… I
had to learn the truth.</p>

message, in a secret spot in Sengimori Forest known only to Kugimiya Karasu and
his faithful servant Sadamoto Shun'ichi, the handsome crow demon revealed
himself to me in a flutter of black wings and a whirlwind of dancing feathers.
His smile was as pleasant as ever, his face warm, and his dark eyes glittering
with a light that spoke volumes of happiness. Yet, the smile vanished, his face
grew icy, and his eyes became daggers once he had realized that I didn’t bring
with me anything except the clothes I was standing in. Of course, that meant he
had thought that I was going to give him <i>Sennen no Inori</i> upon receiving
the message. The disappointment must have been killing him inside. I couldn’t
care less.</p>

with Kotonoha,” I pointed out heatedly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How do you know?” The demon’s brows knitted together in
puzzlement, his eyes blinking in evident surprise.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The Priestess was dead drunk yesterday,” I lied, “so she
blabbed it out all on her own.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What else did she reveal to you?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“None,” I answered. “The only thing she kept repeating was
how much she missed Hikari after the girl left <i>Ise</i> <i>Daijin-guu</i>.”
While the explanation seemed to have satisfied Kugimiya Karasu’s curiosity, it
did nothing to warm up his face. Of course, the way I stared at him
challengingly didn’t really help.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Go back to the Shrine,” Karasu said, his hand making a dismissing
gesture. “Maybe I’ll tell you if you bring me what I need. Maybe.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“No!” I snapped. “Tell me the truth right now!” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Heh,” Karasu narrowed his eyes. “You do not know your place,
kiddo. <i>I</i> am the one who gives command, not you.” He raised his hand and
pointed it at me with his fingers, armed with nails that had grown long enough
to resemble small knives in a heartbeat. “Get out of my sight before I slit your
throat,” he threatened menacingly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Go ahead,” I hissed. “Kill me and lose the opportunity to
get your filthy hand on the sword forever!” My response surprised Karasu so
greatly his arm dropped to his side. He stared at me, eyes unblinking, tongue
seemed to have been glued to the roof of his mouth. He was right when he said
that I had changed. Following Koto-chan around does have its use, I guess. The
high-handed attitude she wielded against the people of Unomichi must have
rubbed off on me and stiffened my backbone more than enough to deal with
Kugimiya Karasu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Tell me!” I demanded. “Who is she?!”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Fine!” the demon muttered. “Amano Hikari, as I told you, was
born into a farmer’s family in Hiroshima Prefecture. They were poor, and the
profit from their crops was barely enough to feed the entire family. Then a
terrible famine struck the region. <i>Everybody</i> starved. Kiddo, you know
how some humans became animals when driven insane by their growling stomachs,
yes? Well, many chose to discard their humanity to become bandits so they could
protect their own lives at the expense of others’. One night, a gang of bandits
assaulted the Amano family. They took away all the food, slaughtered the entire
family except Hikari herself, and then dragged the girl with them, probably
intending to sell her to a brothel.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I gasped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Nah, don’t worry,” Kugimiya Karasu said. “Nothing happened
to her. The bandits bumped into two people later on the road. It was the High
Priestess of <i>Ise</i>, Hiiragi Mikazuki, who was on a journey across the
country with her disciple, an eighteen-year-old girl who happened to be <i>Ise</i>’s
famous prodigy, the one who was rumored to possess powers beyond even the
strongest exorcist at the <i>Grand Shrine </i>itself.” Karasu glanced at me. “Care
to guess her name?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Fuyuu Kotonoha,” I breathed.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Obviously.” Karasu nodded. “Kotonoha and her mentor noticed
the condition the Amano girl was in, so they chased away the bandit and saved
her. I don’t know if it was <i>pity</i> or <i>something else </i>but Kotonoha
insisted that her mentor brought Hikari back to <i>Ise</i>. Given that the
people in the Grand Shrine spoiled the girl rotten, her request was quickly
granted. From that day onward, Amano Hikari became the young Priestess’s <i>personal</i>
page. According to a reliable source, Kotonoha never stayed more than an arm’s
length away from the girl. If you saw one of them, you’d see the other. Some
even joked that they were lovers in their past lives. But of course, Kotonoha
was definitely in love the way she neglected her studies just to hang out with
her page.” My mood grew darker with his every word.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“What happened next?” I muttered coldly.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Kotonoha confessed; what else?” the man rolled his eyes as
if to say <i>‘What are you, stupid?’</i> “Now here’s the interesting thing,
kiddo, Amano Hikari reported it to the High Priestess Hiiragi Mikazuki.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“She did?” My eyes went wide.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh yes.” The crow demon chuckled softly. “She either didn’t
know what to do or disgusted by the confession, I suppose. The very next day,
the old hag announced that she was sending Hikari away to Kyoto to be a servant
in a wealthy family. She wasn’t pleased by the news that a girl had captured
her disciple’s heart and destroyed the girl’s dedication to her training, I’d
say. As far as I can see, it was the wrong decision, for it made Kotonoha spend
the following <i>months</i> wandering aimlessly around the Shrine like a person
who had been robbed of her soul. Heard she broke a few expensive vases, too.” The
chuckle became a deep, rich laughter.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'><i>“Ever since you left Ise Grand Shrine, my life had become
worse than death,” </i>Koto-chan’s voice whispered softly in my ear. My blood
froze, my vision grew teary, and my heart almost stopped.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why did Kotonoha leave <i>Ise </i>for a faraway place like
Hokkaido?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“The official announcement was that Hokkaido was in desperate
need of exorcists, and that the Grand Shrine would like Kotonoha to learn how
to manage a Shrine on her own to prepare for her succession to the post of High
Priestess in the future,” Karasu said. “The real reason behind it, well, who
knows?” </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“How did you… learn all this?” I said, my voice tight and on
the verge of breaking like glass.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I said I had a reliable source; you haven’t been listening,
no?” Karasu answered wryly. “There’s a fallen Priest who was excommunicated
from <i>Ise</i> for his dirty deeds, which he confessed to include gouging
people for the ritual services that actually didn’t cost a yen. Turned out he
needed money to support a concubine he hid from his lioness of a wife. Oh, and
he was addicted to gambling and drugs, too. Silly human, yes?” He paused to
laugh again, this time more loudly and amused. “Well, what do you know? I showered
him with gold and he spilled all I needed to know about our little Priestess.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Why… did you make me assume that girl Hikari’s identity?” I
mumbled. “Why did you make me feign amnesia?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Oh come on. It isn’t that hard to figure out on your own,
you know.” The demon threw up his hands. “Do you think Kotonoha would have
accepted another girl as her assistant so <i>easily</i>, with no questions
asked? Despite the fact that she was betrayed by the Amano girl, the Priestess
never stopped loving her. While in <i>Ise</i>, people had seen her sitting in some
corner of the Shrine, holding a handkerchief close to her heart and cried in
silence. No wonder that old hag of a High Priestess was pissed off.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“A handkerchief?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Yes.” Karasu nodded. “That money-worshipping Priest said
Kotonoha sewn that piece of cloth herself and gave that to the Amano girl as a
present in the beginning. When the girl left <i>Ise</i>, she returned it. That <i>ought</i>
to hurt.” He cackled out loud.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Did your source tell you… what that handkerchief looked
like?” I asked, feeling my blood turn cold as my hand reached into my pocket
and found that which I always brought with me wherever I went.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“Ehm… let’s see,” the demon said while giving his lips a
thoughtful tap. “I think it’s a plain cloth sewn at the corner with a golden
lily. The Priest mentioned that it’s supposed to represent <i>something</i>,
but I forgot what. He got hysterical when speaking about it though.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I see,” I mumbled, my head swayed, my heart throbbed, and my
hand clenched around the piece of cloth in my pocket. It was the handkerchief
Koto-chan lent me during our second meeting, in which I cried my eyes out
grieving for my deceased mom and dad. It was the same handkerchief she gave me
after the outburst of jealousy in the morning Yamazaki Shizuka informed her
that she was going to move away from Unomichi.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You okay, kiddo?” Karasu frowned. “Why do you suddenly look
so pale?”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“I’m… okay…” I said weakly as I turned around and started to
walk away. “See you later.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>“You better bring me the sword then, or else!” the man called
after me, but I hardly cared about his unvoiced threat. In fact, I wouldn’t
have cared if he killed me right then and there. I even would have thanked him
for that. You know why, Nikki-chan? It was because my heart was hurting too badly.
Knowing that the one I loved never loved me, but the girl I was <i>supposed</i>
to be made me feel as though my world had been robbed of the light. It just
hurt too much.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>When Koto-chan returned the following day, she found in her
room the handkerchief she had given me on the table, and in mine a girl who
seemed as though she had lost all meanings to live. Of course, being in low
spirit as I was, I abandoned my duties as her personal assistant, I wouldn’t
talk to her, and I avoided her whenever I could.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>I made her worried, of course. Times and again Koto-chan tried
to find out what had happened, or if she had offended me somehow. More than
once she sat by my futon for an entire evening, hand holding the handkerchief, and
waited for me to speak up. I never did.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Nikki-chan, I didn’t talk much to her, or even want to face
her, wasn’t because I hated her, or was mad at her. It was because every time I
did, I was reminded of the fact that I was but a substitution for the one she
really loved. During those times, I had been very hard pressed to stop the
tears from welling in my eyes. When I saw her outside the safe haven that was
my room, it took every once of strength I had in my body to not run back into there
and hide until the pain subsided. Someone else might not have cared, I suppose.
Someone else might have taken advantaged of the situation. I could not…. Every
night, I would tremble beneath the blanket, bury my face in the pillow, and cry
until I fell asleep. Life had never been so painful. Sometimes, I even wished
that I had died along with my parents in that fire so I wouldn’t have had the
chance to meet and fall in love with Fuyuu Kotonoha.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Our relationship remained that way for another month, with me
being hurt by the raven-haired girl’s misdirected love, with me hurting her
equally so by giving her cold shoulder. Her body grew thin, her body haggard,
and her eyes red enough to suggest that she had been crying during the nights.
I knew she was tormented by my attitude, yet I could do nothing to cheer her up
when I myself barely felt the need to linger in <i>Furisame Jinja</i>.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
text-indent:.5in'>Two weeks before New Year, I was delivered from the pit of
misery in which I trapped myself. By what? Well, that’s for tomorrow,
Nikki-chan. Now, I have to go.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:62.2pt;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-ideograph;
