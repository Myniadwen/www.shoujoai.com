<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 7 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Sunstar stood motionlessly on the roof of the northern block of Keneda 
high school. Finally she lowered her arm, and looked into the distance 
as her blonde ponytail danced in the breeze of the winds. She was 
confused to say the least. Two new starsoldiers? It seemed nuts but 
not impossible. Many things have happened since she became a 
starsoldier. So this shouldn&#146;t seem too farfetched. 

As Sunstar watched the further reaches of the school, she felt herself 
sink into her thoughts.

&#147;I just don&#146;t believe it. Two other starsoldiers in Neo-Tokyo? If it 
is true then that means that&#133;we may stand a better chance against the 
dark force. But why haven&#146;t we noticed them until now? Why did they 
leave so abruptly? The way the tall one acted. It was as if she knew 
about me already. But that can&#146;t be. No one should know about us. 
Whoa, this is too much to take on right now. I need to talk to Yai and 
Keiya about this as soon as I can.&#148;

Sunstar exhaled slowly and de-transformed. She looked around her, just 
in case anyone was there, but found nothing. Alana then quickly walked 
towards the entrance to the room exit and the passed towards it when 
she remembered something.

&#147;Oh dammit I&#146;m late!&#148;

An hour later, the bell rang. Everyone exited Mr. Hinoba&#146;s class in an 
exhausted state. But then, so would anyone who had to read about what 
communists did, god knows how long ago. All through the class, Yai and 
Keiya threw worried looks at each other when the dark force subsided. 
Outside, Yai walked through the door tiredly, and stopped to look 
around. She couldn&#146;t see Keiya anywhere. The crowd of the class died 
down and Yai observed both ends of the corridor. Her face lit up when 
she saw Keiya, but twisted into an angry expression when she saw whom 
the lilac haired starlet was with. Shingo. Keiya was leaning on the 
wall, with her arms rested behind her back. Shingo was leaning in 
front of Keiya, with one arm placed on the wall to support his weight, 
and the other making suggestive hand gestures. He was obviously 
flirting with her, and although Keiya didn&#146;t seem like she wanted to 
be there, she was making no attempts to leave. Yai closed her eyes in 
anger, and felt herself clutch her fists. It was taking every part of 
her rational fiber to prevent herself from charging over there and 
pulling that flirt off her love.

&#147;So what do you think Keiya? You and me, Friday night?&#148;

Keiya smiled uncomfortably, and shifted her position slightly. She was 
used to getting asked out by boys from Keneda on a regular basis but 
she had never met any one as persistent as Shingo, with the exception 
of Yai that is.

&#147;That does sound like a lot of fun, but I don&#146;t think&#133;&#148; Keiya trailed 
off. She hoped Shingo would get the message.

&#147;Ah, come on Keiya. What&#146;s going on here? Things were going well 
before but now you keep blowing me off. Am I doing something wrong?&#148;

Shingo looked sternly at Keiya, but she ducked her eyes from his gaze. 
Couldn&#146;t he understand?

&#147;You&#146;re not doing anything wrong it&#146;s just&#133;&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s just what?&#148;

Keiya breathed out softly and looked away from Shingo. She didn&#146;t 
really see a way out of this. She was about to say something, then 
looked up across the hall to see a very agitated Yai. Keiya started to 
worry when she saw her Chestnut haired angel standing there, silently 
fuming. Keiya quickly faced Shingo and stood upright, and Shingo 
backed up a little to wait for an answer. 

&#147;You know what, I&#146;ll consider it. But right now I need to take care of 
something. Do you mind&#133;?&#148;

Shingo still seemed a little wound up, but took it calmly. He said his 
goodbyes and walked down the corridor to the outside. Keiya exhaled 
again and relaxed a bit. Dealing with this was harder than she thought 
it would be. Keiya didn&#146;t want to hurt Shingo&#146;s feelings, but she also 
didn&#146;t want to do anything to make Yai unhappy. As soon as she thought 
of Yai, she looked up, only to see Yai in front her, staring directly 
at her. Keiya jerked back out of pure surprise, and put on the most 
innocent smile she could to counter-act Yai&#146;s silent rage. Before 
Keiya could even begin to speak, Yai cut in.

&#147;You know I&#146;m starting to think you enjoy having that guy drooling all 
over you.&#148;

Keiya laughed nervously. She couldn&#146;t understand why Yai felt so 
threatened by Shingo, but she could tell it was really getting to her 
Chestnut haired angel.

&#147;I&#146;m not interested in Shingo, Yai. You know that.&#148;

Yai&#146;s eyes narrowed and she looked towards the door at the end of the 
corridor that Shingo had just walked through.

&#147;So why don&#146;t you just set him straight and tell him you aren&#146;t 
interested?&#148;

Yai glanced back at Keiya as her emerald eyes of anger changed to 
those of desperation. She didn&#146;t want to act this way but she couldn&#146;t 
help it. Why should she have to put up with some guy constantly 
flirting with the woman she loves? As Keiya looked into Yai&#146;s shinning 
jade eyes, she finally saw the situation in her light. Keiya suddenly 
felt guilty about it. Yai did have a good point. It can&#146;t be easy to 
have to watch someone hit on your girlfriend and not be able to do 
anything about it. 

&#147;Oh Yai, look I&#146;m sorry. I didn&#146;t mean to hurt you. I&#146;ll tell you 
what, as soon as I next see Shingo, I&#146;ll tell him the truth okay? Come 
on sweetie, please? You&#146;re my angel&#133; don&#146;t be mad at me.&#148;

Yai looked down at the ground, breathed in and looked up with a happy 
smile on her face. She just couldn&#146;t stay angry at her love. 

&#147;Alright then. I&#146;m sorry too. I just can&#146;t stand the thought of him 
being with you.&#148; Yai said apologetically.

&#147;Well lucky for you there&#146;s no chance of that. I&#146;m afraid you&#146;re stuck 
with my love Yai!&#148; Keiya giggled.

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way. But you know&#133;&#148;

A mischievous look crossed Yai&#146;s features as she slowly backed Keiya 
up against the side of the wall. Keiya looked startled, even more so 
when Yai&#146;s arms wrapped themselves around her neck.

&#147;&#133;If you really want to make it up to me&#133;&#148;

Yai wagged her eyebrows suggestively at Keiya. The lilac haired 
starlet blushed and quickly looked around the corner of her eyes to 
see if anybody was around, and then looked back at Yai.

&#147;But we can&#146;t do that here. Someone might see us.&#148;

Yai instantly began running her hands through Keiya&#146;s silky hair and 
gazed at her absently. &#147;There&#146;s no one here.&#148;

&#147;But anyone could just walk in and catch us&#133;&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t mind. It would solve all of my problems. If people knew you 
were seeing me, then no one would try to flirt with you anymore. And 
besides you didn&#146;t have a problem kissing me this morning now did 
you?&#148;

&#147;But that was different&#133;&#148;

Keiya lost her train of thought as Yai moved in a little closer. It 
was getting harder and harder to say no&#133;

&#147;Humph. I may just steal a kiss from you&#133;&#148;

Keiya tried to back off but she was pressed up against a wall, which 
made it a little hard. She felt her blush deepen and her body betray 
her, as her hands traveled up Yai&#146; slender waist.

&#147;&#133;I still &#133;don&#146;t know Yai. I want to, but (umphf!)&#148;

Keiya&#146;s words were cut off when Yai sneakily claimed Keiya&#146;s lips for 
her own. The lilac haired starlet&#146;s eyes widened, but she couldn&#146;t 
help herself. Keiya&#146;s hands gripped Yai&#146;s waist as she let her love 
devour her. Yai&#146;s hands absently left Keiya&#146;s shoulders and moved 
around her body. Yai had been waiting the best part of an hour for 
this and she was going to enjoy it while it lasted. Suddenly the two 
heard an excusing cough come from next to them. Keiya quickly pulled 
away from Yai and looked towards the person across from them. Yai 
didn&#146;t really hear anything, so she was startled when she felt Keiya 
pull away from her. Yai looked at her, but something else had her 
attention, and looked at Keiya&#146;s direction of sight to see Alana. Both 
Keiya and Yai sweat- dropped and blushed furiously as Alana smirked at 
them.

&#147;You two are lucky it was me who caught you in the act. Now if you can 
tear yourselves away from each other, we need to talk.&#148;

Keiya and Yai quickly separated as they realized they were still 
clinging to each other. Alana smiled at the two embarrassed lovers and 
led them away to talk. 

**********

On the other side of town, in an abandoned warehouse just south of 
Goshima harbor, the dark general Tanzanite stood cross-armed and 
close-eyed, wallowing in his own self-pity. He had failed again. Not 
only that, but it seemed as if two new, even more powerful 
starsoldiers had emerged, and time was running out for him. If what 
his vile rival Garnet had said to him was true, then Asumasa may have 
already lost patience with him and would order his execution. Things 
seemed to be at their bleakest now. Tanzanite opened his eyes and 
walked over to the chair on the other side of the hall and sat down. 

&#147;This whole situation seems hopeless. What can I do? Up until now, 
I&#146;ve hardly been able to deal with the interference of the other three 
starsoldiers. Now there are two that seem even more dangerous than the 
rest. I don&#146;t even have the two other talismans to present the queen, 
and I&#146;ve hardly been able to finish gathering any human energy. And my 
strongest demon-monster was no match for them&#133;what am I going to do?&#148;

Tanzanite felt himself sink even deeper into his miserable depression 
with each negative thought. Maybe what Garnet said was right, maybe he 
was a failure. Just as Tanzanite shuffled on his seat, his Gargantua 
card and his Tymirios-alloreiloski card fell out of his pocket. 
Tanzanite looked down at them, and they had fallen on top of each 
other. Suddenly, a brilliant idea crossed the dark general&#146;s mind. He 
quickly stood as he grabbed the Gargantua card from the floor. Smiling 
evilly at it, Tanzanite laughed, extremely pleased&#133;

&#147;Aha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Yes, yes, yes! A superb plan, worthy 
of a great mind like mine&#133;look out starsoldiers! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!&#148;

**********

&#147;Two new starsoldiers?&#148;

Yai couldn&#146;t believe it. She was sitting at the benches with Keiya and 
Alana, just outside of the cafeteria, where they had been discussing 
what Alana had went through at the roof of the northern block. Both 
Yai and Keiya were shocked to hear the news Alana had to tell.

&#147;Yes that right. Two new starsoldiers. They&#146;re extremely powerful, I 
could sense it. And I think they beat Tanzanite&#146;s creature with ease.&#148; 

&#147;That great!&#148; Yai said cheerfully. &#147;With the help of two others we&#146;ll 
be unstoppable! Hey they may even go to Keneda!&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not so sure about that that Yai&#133;&#148; Keiya said calmly.

&#147;What&#133;? You don&#146;t think they go to Keneda?&#148;

&#147;Huh? No, I mean I wouldn&#146;t be so sure that they&#146;ll help us.&#148;

Yai looked puzzled. &#147;What do you mean Keiya?&#148;

&#147;Well what I mean is, we can&#146;t be sure that this is a good thing. 
Alana said that from the way they were talking, they already knew 
about us. So why haven&#146;t they tried to approach us?&#148;

&#147;Maybe they&#146;re shy&#133;?&#148; 

&#147;Do they sound like shy people?&#148;

&#147;Well&#133;no.&#148;

&#147;For all we know, they could have a hidden agenda that we know nothing 
about. Those two might not even be real starsoldiers. They could 
belong to a third party we&#146;re oblivious to. We just can&#146;t be sure of 
them.&#148; 

Yai looked at Keiya and realized that she may be right. There was 
nothing they could actually confirm about these two, and that made 
them even more dangerous than Tanzanite.

&#147;I think you have a point Keiya,&#148; said Alana &#147;We really can&#146;t take the 
risk of believing that they are on our side. So think we have to do 
some Talisman hunting.&#148;

Yai seemed confused as she listened to Alana, and turned to face her.

&#147;What do you mean by &#145;Talisman hunting&#146;&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Well we can&#146;t be sure that we can trust them, and Tanzanite needs the 
Talismans for some reason. So if we take them and the other two have 
no problem with it, then we know that there on our side and if they 
do, then we know that they are our enemies. Either way, we stop 
Tanzanite, and we figure out our position with the other 
starsoldiers.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s a good plan Alana. So where do we start?&#148; Keiya asked.

Yai piped up with her know-it-all look as turned back to her 
girlfriend.

&#147;I say we should begin here. I mean this is the third time that 
they&#146;ve attacked the school, so logically we could assume that there 
is something special about it.&#148;

Keiya nodded in agreement.

&#147;Alright then. So we&#146;re agreed. We search this place out. Probably a 
bit later though, when everyone is gone. That way we wont arouse any 
suspicions.&#148;

Alana agreed also.

&#147;Right. We&#146;ll all meet here in our starsoldier forms at around 9.00. 
No one should be here by then and we can search freely.&#148;

 &#147;Alright Alana. Then that&#146;s the plan. I just hope we can find the 
Talismans without any outside interference.&#148; Yai said. 

The three then talked in preparation for tonight&#133;

9.00, Monday night, Keneda high school

Just outside the front gates of Keneda high school, three shadowy 
figures stalked in from opposite directions. The three warriors 
quickly gathered at the front gates, namely Lovestar, Waterstar and 
Sunstar. The magic starsoldiers. Sunstar crossed her arms and smiled 
amused.

&#147;Well at least you two made it here on time!&#148;

Lovestar and Waterstar turned to her as she whistled to herself in a 
singsong manner. 

&#147;And just what&#146;s that supposed to mean?&#148;

&#147;Oh nothing, nothing!&#148; Sunstar said innocently. Lovestar shot Sunstar 
an icy stare, but before anything got started, Waterstar returned to 
the task at hand.

&#147;Alright, alright. Lets not forget that we have a mission here.&#148; 
Waterstar reminded.  

Lovestar and Sunstar nodded. The three the decided to split up and 
search out the grounds of Keneda high school and look for the 
talismans individually. Although this was the time they picked, by 
9.00 the sky was pitch black; making it a lot harder to search for 
them. Sunstar leapt off over the gates and headed towards the workshop 
first, at the southern part of the school.  Waterstar chose to start 
at the back of the school, around the auditorium and the track fields. 
Lovestar decided to search out the core of the school and went into 
the northern blocks. Lovestar walked along the path to the doors of 
the northern block. It was locked, but saving the world took priority 
over destroying public property. She punched at the frame of the door 
violently, and the shockwaves of the blow broke the lock from the 
outside. The door clicked eerily and Lovestar gently pushed the doors 
aside. They creaked loudly, and echoed into the foreboding darkness of 
the hallway. She stepped in carefully and walked across the corridor. 
Lovestar looked through everything, searching every room and checking 
under every table and chair. After around 30 minutes, she found 
nothing. Just before deciding to leave the northern block, she 
remembered that Sunstar had run into Tanzanite and the other two 
starsoldiers on the roof of the block. She walked down the corridor 
and around the corner to reach the far spiral staircase. Lovestar 
swiftly walked up the stairs and as she reached the top, she realized 
that this door was also locked. Again she punched at the door, 
breaking the inside lock and opening the door from the outside. She 
pushed the door open and walked out into the floor of the roof. She 
remembered coming up here with Hisaka and Yumi every lunchtime. 
Lovestar walked over to the ledge and observed Waterstar searching for 
the talismans. She sighed dreamily as she watched the Goddess of the 
sea search and search. Quickly she clicked back into focus when she 
remembered her job. The chestnut haired girl looked around out here 
for the Talisman but still had no luck. She looked all over the place 
but she couldn&#146;t find anything that could possibly resemble a 
talisman. Although she had never seen one, she was sure that she would 
know it when she found it, but it seemed as if she was no closer to 
finding one that she did half an hour ago. 

&#147;Dammit I can&#146;t find anything. Waterstar doesn&#146;t look like she&#146;s found 
anything either, but I wonder if Sunstar&#146;s had any luck? I can&#146;t see 
the workshops from here. Darn, if only there were some way to sense 
the location of these talismans. That would save so much time and 
effort. Wait&#133;maybe I can sense it&#133; I have to try. I just need to lock 
onto something that&#146;s emitting energy, that isn&#146;t familiar to me&#133;&#148;

With her idea, Lovestar was filled with a fresh determination. She 
quickly sat down, crossed her arms and legs and closed her eyes. 
Lovestar began to concentrate and after a few minutes, she was being 
surrounded by a golden energy&#133;similar to the one that had overrun her 
body whilst fighting Plague, Poison and Virus, the insidious trio. 
Suddenly everything around her fell out of focus, like she had quickly 
sunken into a void of nothingness. Slowly the nothingness was replaced 
by spiritually virtual world, identical to her own. She felt of a drop 
of sweat trickle down her face, but she had to concentrate. Then at 
some point, Lovestar felt units of energy enter the world. She sensed 
two strong powers. They were both below her point, but one north from 
her and the other south.

&#147;Those powers are obviously Waterstar and Sunstar. Now I need to hone 
in on something that doesn&#146;t feel right here&#133;something that feels 
foreign&#133;out of place...&#148;

Lovestar felt her body tensing; she couldn&#146;t keep this up much longer. 
Strangely, she felt a blip of energy, around 20 metres from the energy 
signal that represented Waterstar. Was that it? Lovestar focussed in 
on the blip and realized it was the Talisman! Lovestar abruptly 
dropped her senses and return to the real world. Lovestar quickly 
caught her breath and stood, then began to dash to the door of the 
roof. She made her way down the staircase. As she bolted out of the 
northern block, she made her way towards the track fields. When she 
got there she saw Waterstar, who was completely stumped. The Goddess 
of the sea heard steps behind her and leapt back defensively and 
prepared to attack the offender, but eased as she caught a better look 
at her.

&#147;Lovestar?! Don&#146;t sneak up on me like that! Jeez!&#148; Waterstar said 
annoyed. 

Lovestar pouted. &#147;Well excuse me miss. Next time I&#146;ll announce my 
position from fifty paces&#133;&#148;

&#147;Okay, okay. So what did you come here for? Did you find anything?&#148;

&#147;Well, sort of. I think so.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Sort of? What does that mean?&#148;

&#147;It means that I think I found it, but it&#146;s probably berried under 
soil&#133;over there.&#148; 

Lovestar pointed to the area that she sensed before.

&#147;Are you sure it&#146;s there? How could you know that?&#148;

&#147;I kinda sensed it. I&#146;ll go into better detail later but we should go 
get it now.&#148;

&#147;Okay. Lets dig it up.&#148;

Lovestar and Waterstar went over to the area they were talking about, 
and started to dig at the ground. Although the talisman wasn&#146;t too 
deep, digging at it was taking too much time. And getting them 
nowhere. After around 20 minutes of burrowing, Waterstar and Lovestar 
gave up. There was definitely something down there. It&#146;s just getting 
to it. That was the problem.

Lovestar slammed her fists into the ground, in pure exhaustion.

&#147;Darn this! Digging at it gets us nowhere, but if we use our energy 
attacks on the ground, we run the risk of destroying the Talisman&#133;&#148;

Waterstar stood and thought for a second.

&#147;Hey that&#146;s it! Lovestar. Wait here, I&#146;m going to get Sunstar.&#148;

Waterstar leapt off towards the workshops on the other side of the 
school. 10 minutes later, she returned with Sunstar. Sunstar walked 
over to the ditch that Waterstar and Lovestar dug up and looked it 
over with a wavering curiosity.

&#147;You&#146;re telling me, you think one of the Talismans is under here?&#148;

&#147;Yes!&#148;  Lovestar said. &#147;I know my senses are right. Now why did you 
bring Sunstar over here so urgently Waterstar?&#148;

Waterstar faced Sunstar and pointed at the ditch.

&#147;Alright Sunstar. We need you to use your Shining Sunset Beam on this 
ditch. I want you to focus the beam around its edges.&#148;

Sunstar turned from Waterstar and pointed her fingertip at the ditch. 
Lovestar still looked confused but Waterstar motioned her to watch.

&#147;Shining Sunset Beam!&#148;

Sunstar yelled out her attack, and a small barrier formed around her 
finger. Sharply, a thin beam of golden pinpoint energy shot out from 
it and carved out the front of the ditch. After a while, smoke filled 
the hole, even deeper now. The beam subsided, and Sunstar turned her 
head around and looked at Waterstar, still retaining her position.

&#147;Is this enough?&#148;

Waterstar nodded and told Lovestar to remove the clump of soil created 
by the beam. Lovestar grunted, but said nothing, and swiftly walked 
over to the ditch and took it out. She chucked it away across from 
her. All three starsoldiers turned and looked on as they saw a shining 
silver item in the smoke and dirt. Transfixed by its beauty, Lovestar 
reached out and clasped it, gently wiping away the soil covering it. 

&#147;&#133;This&#133;is a Talisman?&#148; she said stunned.

Waterstar walked over to the goddess of love and peace and kneeled 
next to her, looking at the object in her hand.

&#147;You know, I think it is&#133;&#148;

Lovestar looked up at Waterstar.

&#147;So now what do we do with it?&#148; She asked.

&#147;Well I&#146;ll take it back to my house.&#148;

&#147;Why do you get to take home? I can look after it to. Besides, I was 
the one who sensed it here, and I helped dig it up, so I should take 
it.&#148;

Waterstar sighed. &#147;Yeah, but it&#146;ll be safer with me. You both live 
with other people so there is a chance someone could find it.&#148;

&#147;She&#146;s right Lovestar. I caught my little sister Nanami spying on the 
books of Tarn that Waterstar lent to me.&#148; Sunstar added.

&#147;Fine Waterstar, just look after it.&#148; Lovestar handed it over to 
Waterstar and stood upright. Waterstar did the same and looked in 
between the other two.

&#147;Alright guys. Lets book. I don&#146;t wanna stay here any longer. We are 
technically trespassing.&#148;

Sunstar agreed. &#147;Yeah. We&#146;ll talk more in the morning.&#148; Sunstar waved 
goodbye, and leapt over the far wall. Waterstar and Lovestar nodded to 
each other and leapt across the fields to the Northern road. When they 
reached a back alley later on, they de-transformed and walked out in 
normal form. They eventually reached Yai&#146;s house and stood in front of 
the door. As they looked at each other, they suddenly became quite 
embarrassed. Keiya couldn&#146;t control her blush and Yai just kept 
looking to the floor and shuffling her feet. The two acted like some 
love struck teens coming home from a hot date. 

&#147;What is this? I mean I know how I feel about Yai but still&#133;I just 
came back from a mission. Shouldn&#146;t I be more pre-occupied with that?&#148; 
Keiya thought.

Yai seemed a little more awkward, and felt herself lose sight of 
things. 

&#147;So&#133;do you&#133;want to come in?&#148; Yai felt herself blurt out quickly.

&#147;I&#146;d like to but it&#146;s getting a little late.&#148;

Keiya leaned in and kissed Yai on the cheek. Yai smiled to her as she 
began to leave, and turned to put her key in the lock, but kept her 
eyes on Keiya. 

 &#147;Hey Keiya! Take care of that you know what!&#148; Yai shouted out. Keiya 
waved to her and continued to walk away.

Still racked with thoughts of her Lilac haired love, Yai absently 
turned the key in the lock and walked in. But before Yai could even 
get up the stairs, her mom, Mrs Kitana, trapped her. Yai gulped as she 
saw the anger on her mother&#146;s face.

&#147;Young lady, where in blue blazes have you been all night?&#148;

Saturday afternoon, 4.00, Neo-Tokyo arcade

On Saturday, 6 days after they found the talisman at Keneda, Yai and 
Keiya went out on their first official date. They had gone to an early 
movie, some subtitled romance flick that Yai went nuts over, but Keiya 
couldn&#146;t really stand. All she really wanted to do was to have a good 
time with the chestnut haired girl, even if it meant coping with two 
and a half hours of a boring film. After that, they went to a fancy 
new Italian restaurant that had opened a couple of weeks ago. They 
both enjoyed the meal, and after they paid for an expensive bill, they 
went to a coffee shop on the new Neo-Tokyo shopping arcade. They had 
been waiting for this since they first admitted their love for one and 
other, and now that it was finally here; they just felt so happy and 
contented to be with each other. However, Keiya still didn&#146;t want to 
be too open about their relationship, so they weren&#146;t holding hands or 
anything, which exasperated Yai, but she made the resolve to wait. She 
just needed to give Keiya a little time. All that mattered was that 
they were in love.

The two were sitting across from each other on a small table just 
outside the coffee shop. 

Yai rested her head on her palm and laughed happily. 

&#147;This is kinda weird huh? I mean our first date!&#148;

&#147;Yeah. But it&#146;s so great just being here with you.&#148;

Yai smiled at Keiya even more brightly, and was just about to say 
something, when a recognizable voice called out to them.

&#147;Hey Yai, Keiya!&#148;

Both Keiya and Yai looked around to see exactly who was calling them, 
and it was the exact person who they thought it was. It was Hisaka, 
walking with around five bags of clothes from different stores while 
Yumi was next to her, and seemed somewhat fatigued. The worn-out girl 
looked in between Keiya and Yai and realized what ever it was that was 
going on between the two of them must have passed. 

&#147;You guys don&#146;t mind if we join you, do you&#133;?&#148; she asked tiredly.

&#147;Well now that you mention it&#133;&#148; Yai got cut off when Keiya quickly 
trod on her foot. She winced, and almost yelped out, and shot a 
withering stare at Keiya, who smiled at Hisaka and Yumi.

&#147;We would love you to stay.&#148;

&#147;Cool! Hold on a minute, Yumi and me are gonna get a cup of coffee, 
back in a sec!&#148;

Hisaka placed her bags on the ground, grabbed Yumi&#146;s wrist and dragged 
her off into the shop. Yumi just sighed and followed along. Keiya 
looked back at Yai after watching them leave, and felt Yai step on her 
foot in retaliation.

&#147;Ow! What did you do that for?&#148;

Yai just stared at Keiya blankly and leaned back in her chair.

&#147;That was for just now. And what do you think your doing? I wanted to 
go on a date with my girlfriend. Alone with my girlfriend.&#148;

&#147;I know that. So did I. But they are our friends. We can&#146;t just turn 
them away.&#148;

&#147;I guess so.&#148;

Just then, Hisaka and Yumi turned returned with something to drink and 
sat down. Trying to be as nice as she could, Yai decided to say 
something. 

&#147;Hey, where were you guys on Monday? I forgot to ask you.&#148;

&#147;We&#133;&#148; Hisaka started off but stopped when she remembered what Yumi 
said.

&#147;&#133;I can&#146;t really say. We&#146;ll tell you soon, but not now. Not until 
everything is ready.&#148; She said regretfully.

Yai looked surprised. &#147;Really? I thought you guys were just trying to 
sneak off with Tetsura and Shinichi!&#148;

Hisaka giggled when she thought of her boyfriend, Tetsura.

&#147;Now what gave you that idea? You know me Yai; I&#146;m an old-fashioned 
gal! So Keiya how goes things with you and Shingo?&#148;

The minute Yai heard Shingo&#146;s name, she became distinctly annoyed. She 
looked away irately and rested her head on her palm again, except this 
time she was carrying a frown that could slaughter an army. Keiya 
snuck a peek at Yai, and sighed exhaustedly as she saw the chestnut 
haired girl&#146;s ramification of Shingo&#146;s name. She originally thought 
Yai&#146;s jealously was cute, but now it was getting excessive. Keiya 
hadn&#146;t had a chance to talk to him since he was called away sick with 
the flu, since Tuesday.

&#147;Dammit Hisaka, why did you have to bring up such a sensitive 
subject?&#148;

&#147;Well Shingo is nice, but I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll be seeing him anymore.&#148;

&#147;Why not? He&#146;s pretty cute isn&#146;t he?&#148; Yumi asked.

&#147;He is, but I&#146;ve found someone else that I am totally crazy about.&#148; 
Keiya replied.

Yai felt a familiar smile creep across her face as she heard Keiya 
speak.

&#147;Really? Is he a hottie? Who is he? Do I know him? Come on tell me!&#148; 
Hisaka asked impatiently. Keiya smiled and stuck her tongue out at 
Hisaka.

&#147;It&#146;s a secret!&#148;

Yai felt her tense disposition ease as Keiya, Hisaka and Yumi started 
laughing. She observed Keiya out of the corner of her eye and felt her 
cheeks flush as she watched her beautiful smile&#133;

&#147;I love you Keiya.&#148;  

A couple of hours later, Yai and Keiya left early. Hisaka and Yumi 
continued shopping after they left, saying their goodbyes. The two cut 
their date short and went back to Yai&#146;s house, since Yai&#146;s house was 
the closest to them and her parents were out. Yai opened the door and 
double-checked for anyone. Nope&#133;no one. Yai held Keiya&#146;s hand and led 
her upstairs to her room&#133;

Keiya walked though the door and sat down on Yai&#146;s single sized bed. 
Yai looked around for anyone just in case, but then closed the door 
when she made sure there was no one there. Keiya took of her coat and 
lay down on the bed. She closed her eyes and breathed in slowly. Keiya 
then opened her eyes quickly when she heard a thud on the bed, only to 
see Yai on top of her, one of her legs in between both of her own, 
slightly brushing the inner calf of her thighs. The chestnut haired 
girl&#146;s lips were only inches away from her own, and that same look of 
passion crossed her eyes again as she stared down at her love. Keiya 
smiled a devilish smile at her lover, who had pinned her to the bed.

&#147;Whoa, whoa, whoa! Since when did my sweet little Yai become such a 
vixen?&#148; Keiya joked.

Yai slowly lowered her face a little closer to Keiya&#146;s.

&#147;When she stared dating the most attractive girl in Neo-Tokyo.&#148;

&#147;Funnily enough I thought that was dating her&#133;&#148;

Yai smiled and passionately kissed the Lilac haired starlet. Keiya 
moaned lightly into Yai&#146;s mouth and clasped both of her cheeks. Yai&#146;s 
hands travelled down Keiya&#146;s slim body and rested themselves either 
side of her waist. Keiya parted Yai&#146;s soft lips with her tongue and 
moved her arms around the chestnut haired girl&#146;s neck, to draw her in 
closer. Yai kissed Keiya a little more forcefully, as she pushed the 
length of her tongue down Keiya&#146;s throat. Keiya then gently rolled Yai 
over to switch positions, so that she was now on top of Yai, all the 
while, still not breaking the kiss. Yai sighed as she felt Keiya&#146;s 
thighs repeatedly rub the tenderness of her hips. She then clung to 
Keiya tightly, as if Keiya was a life preserver. Sweet mother of god 
she needed this. And now that it was here she couldn&#146;t give it up. 
Time seemed to pass like an eternity, and Yai felt herself slipping 
deeper and deeper into ecstasy, as Keiya&#146;s velvet-soft lips clamed her 
own. Unfortunately for her, the chestnut haired girl opened her eyes 
as she thought she heard something. Keiya obviously didn&#146;t hear 
anything, and her hands involuntarily inched their way up Yai&#146;s 
blouse. Yai tried to tell Keiya that she heard something, but that was 
a bit difficult since the Lilac haired starlet was going to town on 
her. Yai&#146;s constant squirming unnerved Keiya and she opened her eyes. 
Keiya broke the kiss and panted lightly.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; She said breathlessly. 

&#147;I think I heard the phone.&#148; Yai responded, equally drained. 

&#147;Can&#146;t you just forget about it&#133;?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d like to but&#133;it could be important. I&#146;ll be right back.&#148;

Keiya got off of Yai and lay down on the bed. Yai stood up and walked 
over to the door. Just as she reached the door, she looked back at 
Keiya and marvelled at how completely irresistible she looked just 
lying there, so innocent and pure. 

&#147;Who ever it is better have a damn good reason for calling me now.&#148; 
Yai thought.

Yai walked over to the table and picked up the receiver of the phone.

&#147;Hello&#133;Alana&#133;what&#146;s the problem, you know you just disturbed me in the 
middle of&#133;what&#133;yes that is the one&#133;is it that powerful&#133; alright 
then&#133;just wait there&#133;yeah she&#146;s with me&#133;we&#146;ll be right there 
okay&#133;bye.&#148;

Yai put the phone down and sighed unhappily. Then Keiya walked up to 
her.

&#147;Something wrong?&#148;

&#147;Alana said she felt strong energy coming from the park where Wong-lao 
attacked us. She wants some help to tackle it.&#148;

&#147;Is that why you sound so sad&#133;?&#148; Keiya didn&#146;t look convinced.

&#147;It&#146;s just that&#133;well every time I get you all to myself, something 
else gets in the way&#133;&#148; Yai looked down. She suddenly felt 
heavy-hearted.

Keiya walked over to Yai and hugged her warmly. Yai felt herself 
dissolve into Keiya&#146;s embrace.

&#147;It&#146;s okay Yai. We&#146;ll get other chances to spend more time together 
alone I promise, we just need to take care of this and you will have 
me all to yourself. Don&#146;t worry Yai.&#148;

&#147;I wont&#133;as long as I&#146;m with you.&#148;

The northern road park, just below the northern road, 7.50

Sunstar waited anxiously for any sign of Lovestar and Waterstar. She 
was by the front gates, not willing to enter the park alone after 
feeling the magnitude of the energy being gathered in there. Then over 
the road, Lovestar and Waterstar quickly arrived. Waterstar walked 
over to the entrance and observed the park, Lovestar started to talk 
to Sunstar.

&#147;So now what? Should we enter Sunstar?&#148;

&#147;Yes, but we must all be on our guard.&#148;

Sunstar, Waterstar and Lovestar walked cautiously through the rusty 
iron front gates into the park. The three spread out and looked around 
for anyone. They could find nothing, until Waterstar heard a twig snap 
behind her. She turned around to see two figures bathed in darkness. 
All three starsoldiers turned around and faced the two. Calmly, the 
two characters stepped out of the shadows to reveal themselves. The 
shorter, redheaded one laughed out-loud as she looked at the three.

&#147;I think these are the ones Earthstar!&#148; 

The heavily banged, taller one frowned as she watched the three and 
nodded along.

&#147;You&#146;re right Firestar. They are the ones.&#148;

&#147;Hey who are you?&#148; Lovestar shouted at them. The one called Earthstar 
sighed and replied.

&#147;I am Earthstar. This woman standing beside me is called Firestar. We 
are also Magic Starsoldiers. We sensed an evil force in this vicinity, 
so we decided to check it out, and what do we find? You.&#148;

&#147;You can&#146;t honestly believe that the energy you sensed came from us?&#148; 
Sunstar asked.

Firestar crossed her arms and looked in between Sunstar and Lovestar.

&#147;It wouldn&#146;t surprise me if it did.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; Waterstar became angry, and stepped towards the two as if to 
challenge them, and Firestar grinned wildly as she welcomed the 
challenge&#133;

Lovestar quickly grabbed Waterstar wrist to prevent her from fighting.

&#147;Wait a minute. We share a common enemy. Why can&#146;t we help each 
other?&#148;

Lovestar pleaded to them. Maybe they could see sense.  Earthstar was 
about to say some thing when she heard a sound come from behind them. 
She turned around hastily and the others faced the direction she 
turned to. And there, standing in the obscurity of the shadows, the 
evil dark general Tanzanite stood, grinning evilly as she watched the 
five starsoldiers. 

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha! Good. You&#146;re all in one place. Now I can kill five 
birds with one stone, this is the end of the road for you all. The 
game ends here!!!!&#148;

Firestar smirked at the dark-general&#146;s confidence.

&#147;Oh really? You think you can take on five of us when you struggled 
with just me?&#148;

&#147;Foolish girl. You have absolutely no idea as to whom you are dealing 
with here do you? Well now let me show you the terrifying power of the 
Dark force. We are going to settle this once and for all!!!!!&#148;

Tanzanite put his hand behind his back, keeping his eyes locked onto 
the starsoldiers, he pulled out a card mumbled the dark chant as he 
let it hover in the air. The card became amerced in a furious blue 
energy, and it shone brightly. Tanzanite, still laughing, raised his 
fist and began to gather energy into it. In one quick move, he plunged 
his right hand straight into his chest, dousing his armour in blood. 
All of the starsoldiers looked on in alarm as he pulled his blood 
soaked hand out of his chest.

&#147;This guy is&#133;is nuts&#133;&#148; Lovestar said shocked.

Tanzanite grinned as a trail of blood trickled down the side of his 
mouth. The card that he had invoked reacted wildly to his wound and a 
beam of pure energy shot from out the card and carved it&#146;s way through 
the gaping hole in his chest. The light beam then drew the card into 
the dark general&#146;s chest, and he screamed as the card embedded itself 
inside him. He again started to laugh weakly, as a blinding blue light 
surrounded his body. The clothes he was wearing shredded themselves 
under the force of the light. With his fists clenched and his body 
pulsing with a dark, unstoppable energy, Tanzanite began to transform 
into a massive, demonic creature. The light flashed so brightly that 
starsoldiers had to cover their eyes to prevent themselves from being 
blinded. As the light died down, Lovestar, Waterstar, Sunstar, 
Earthstar and Firestar looked towards the spot where Tanzanite had 
once been. Standing in a pile of dust and smoke, stood the creature. A 
Tall, hulking beast with massive bulging muscles. Its skin was pure 
ebony black, with a sleek lizard-like tail, waving behind it. Its eyes 
were a dark purple, and it hand two long fangs, so large that they 
dropped over the edges of his mouth. There was a bright red scar on 
his chest, and the veins around that area seemed to rise and pulsate. 
Out of the sides of his shoulders were two large spikes, polished and 
shining. Despite his powerful aura, his body seemed unstable&#133;and 
dangerous.

&#147;And now&#133;see the result of a Darkforce fusion&#133;with the combined powers 
of Gargantua and Tanzanite, I will demolish you! I am 
Tanzanite-demon!!!&#148;

Slowly, the demon began to amble en route for the starsoldiers, and 
the warriors looked on in terror as they felt the true extent of his 
power&#133;
