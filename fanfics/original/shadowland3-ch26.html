<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 26 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>Natalie swept more garbage towards Misty, stopped and leaned heavily 
upon the broom, &quot;She&#39;s a shy one isn&#39;t she?&quot; She remarked watching Penny 
through a large opening in the wall that was used as a buffet area 
during dinning hours. 

Misty glanced over her shoulder and leaned against a nearby wall, &quot;She 
is kind of cute, I can see why Kima was attracted to her. She looks like 
a more innocent version of Jessie actually.&quot; 

&quot;I hope she isn&#39;t exactly like Jessica.&quot; Emily remarked with a sigh, &quot;We 
already have our hands full with her and Kim, we don&#39;t need another 
one.&quot; 

Natalie nodded in agreement, &quot;I just hope Kim knows what she is doing. 
That girl looks so fragile, just like Kim used to be.&quot; 

Misty smiled and pulled the bag of garbage to the side of the room, 
&quot;Then she should know to handle the girl with care.&quot; She stated simply, 
and then turned to face Natalie and saw the intense look upon her face, 
&quot;You don&#39;t think Kima would hurt her do you?&quot; 

Natalie shook her head, &quot;Not intentionally.&quot; She rubbed her head, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know about this new form of hers. I hope she isn&#39;t jumping into 
things too quickly. I know both Kims had feelings for Jennifer and that 
worries me.&quot; 

Misty looked over at the girl and back to Natalie, &quot;You mean, what will 
happen if she remembers her feelings for Jenn?&quot; She mulled this over for 
a moment, &quot;I kind of feel sorry for Jenn really. I mean Kim and her were 
really close and now all this mess with Kris and Jessica and Kim 
disappearing and everything. I don&#39;t know how much I could handle.&quot; 

Tanya approached the group, &quot;I worry about Jenn too.&quot; She admitted 
worriedly, &quot;She had gone through so much since returning here and I&#39;m 
afraid she will not be able to handle much more.&quot; 

Natalie shook her head, &quot;Jenn&#39;s a strong girl. I can see it in her.&quot; She 
stated firmly, &quot;She may need some help along the way, but I think we can 
keep her together.&quot; 

Cherilyn nodded in agreement, &quot;We&#39;ll make sure she gets through this.&quot; 

Emily glanced at Natalie, &quot;So how are you and Alyson doing lately? I 
noticed she ran off to her room earlier. Why are you not with her right 
now?&quot; She inquired with a sly grin. 

Natalie rubbed her face in embarrassment, &quot;We aren&#39;t a couple.&quot; She 
stated dismally, &quot;She can do what she likes.&quot; 

Misty watched the girl carefully, &quot;You can&#39;t tell me you don&#39;t have 
feelings for the girl. I&#39;ve seen the way you look at her.&quot; She stated 
knowingly.

&quot;Hell, even I would date her.&quot; Emily declared, &quot;Even though girls aren&#39;t 
my thing.&quot; 

Tanya starred at the girl in shock, &quot;Your straight?&quot; She inquired in 
astonishment. 

Misty nodded, &quot;Straight as they come, you should see the posters on her 
wall.&quot; She stuck out her tongue in disgust.

&quot;Don&#39;t stick it out unless you intend to use it.&quot; Emily playfully 
flirted with the girl. 

Misty blushed and pulled her tongue back into her mouth, &quot;You&#39;re 
impossible at times.&quot; 

Tanya glanced between the two girls, &quot;You mean this flirting? You&#39;re 
just kidding around?&quot; She asked in confusion. 

Emily wrapped her arms around Misty&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Having this girl as a 
friend I had to learn to play along. You should have seen her, she 
taught me all I know.&quot; 

Misty put up her hands in defence, &quot;I never taught you to act that way. 
I&#39;m just amazed you haven&#39;t been hit on by one of the girls the way you 
act.&quot; 

Emily rubbed her cheek up against Misty&#39;s; &quot;I only act this way with 
you.&quot; She giggled and let the girl go and Misty gave chase. 

&quot;Help me!&quot; Emily pleaded as she hid behind Natalie&#39;s back and used the 
girl as a shield against Misty. 

Misty stopped before Natalie and gave the girl a sly smile, &quot;Oh, do you 
think you can hide behind her?&quot; She inquired in amusement. 

Emily set her chin on Natalie&#39;s shoulder and looked at the girl through 
the corner of her eyes, &quot;You won&#39;t let her hurt me would you?&quot; She 
inquired sweetly, batting her eyes innocently. 

Misty continued to smile, &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the one you should worry 
about.&quot; She stated pointing at Natalie. 

Emily blinked at the girl in confusion, &quot;What do you me-?&quot;

Abruptly Natalie spun around and wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s 
chest and arms, locking them behind Emily&#39;s back, Emily&#39;s arms curled up 
in between the two of them, &quot;Now what are you going to do?&quot; Natalie 
asked, now eye-to-eye with the girl. 

Emily swallowed hard as she stared into Natalie&#39;s powder blue eyes and 
softly punched at the girl&#39;s chest, &quot;You&#39;re as bad as she is.&quot; She 
playfully complained then slyly smiled up at Natalie, &quot;Is this the type 
of game you would like to play with Alyson?&quot; She inquired, slipping one 
of her hands out from under Natalie&#39;s arms and through the back of the 
girl&#39;s hair. 

Natalie suddenly released the girl and stepped away from her, &quot;Lord, for 
someone who claims to be straight you play dangerously.&quot; 

Emily giggled, &quot;I learned from the best.&quot; 

Misty stomped her foot, &quot;Stop telling lies.&quot; She glanced around the 
group of girls, &quot;You don&#39;t think I taught her to act like this do you?&quot; 

Tanya and Cherilyn laughed, &quot;I don&#39;t know, but she sure made Natalie 
run.&quot; Tanya said through her giggles. 

Cherilyn nodded as her face reddened with laughter, &quot;Nat, your face is 
so red. I&#39;ve never seen you move so quickly before.&quot; She held her 
stomach as she tried to control her giggles. 

Kris stepped out of the kitchen with Penny beside her, a plate of Kraft 
Dinner in her hands, &quot;You girls seem to be having fun.&quot; She said with a 
smile.

Natalie turned to Kris, &quot;We may have another girl to join the ranks of 
Jessica and Kima.&quot; She remarked with a nod towards Emily.&quot; 

Emily hopped up on a table and sat, tucking her skirt under herself and 
crossing her legs, &quot;You can&#39;t rank me up with them. I&#39;m innocent.&quot; 

Tanya and Cherilyn burst into another round of laughter, there cheerful 
nature was suddenly cut short as the entire building began to shake and 
the lights flickered and finally turned off entirely, plunging them into 
darkness.
