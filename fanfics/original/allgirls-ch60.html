&quot;Evening with the Twins&quot;

With the winter holidays not far off, the world was transforming, again 
and again. The winds that had once been fair and warm were now bitter 
and chilling. The sky, once purest sapphire, was now a tainted gray. 
Rarely did the sun come out, and not once did it share its once revered 
glowing warmth. Crystals of ice came from heaven to form on the ground 
as snow, and the world soon became covered in red, white, and green 
lights. Pine trees dotted lots and yards. Nativity scenes sprang up. 
Menorahs began to glow faithfully. When night came, the stars shone out 
clearly in the cold air, and the world shivered just slightly from the 
feel of magic.

By now, June Tramble could see her breath whenever she exhaled. The 
heater had to be kept on constantly, and she and her twin sister were 
now resorting to wearing sweaters and long-sleeved shirts around the 
house. June, being born in the twilight of spring, didn&#39;t care for cold 
weather nor the hazards involved with it. It had been years since she 
saw winter as a wonderland&#151;it had been during one icy day when she lost 
the use of her legs&#151;and even though there was a pretty snow bunny in her 
life named Victoria, June still felt more Scrooge than Saint.

&quot;Bah humbug,&quot; she sighed, spraying the window with her ghostly breath. 
The snow outside was piling up gradually&#151;soon May and her parents would 
have to go out and shovel the driveway&#151;and the radio playing worn-out 
holiday songs wasn&#39;t making the mood any better. June had never really 
liked Christmas, though she attended church service religiously and 
observed most of the customs. It was, after all, the time of year when 
she was most reminded of her handicap, when she seemed most helpless, 
the most cold, the most lonely.

Her sister came back inside, shivering but clearly happy.

&quot;You should come outside!&quot; she exclaimed, rubbing her hands on her face. 
&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful, June! There&#39;s snow everywhere.&quot;

&quot;I can see it just fine here.&quot; Knowing how glum her twin usually got 
during this time of the year, May trailed over and tickled the slightly 
younger girl.

&quot;Aren&#39;t we a Grinch this year! Come on, cheer up!&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; squealed June amidst laughter. May refused and even went 
faster.

&quot;No way, come on! You&#39;ve got no excuse to be sad this year. You&#39;re out 
of the closet, mom and dad are cool with it, you&#39;ve got a wonderful 
girlfriend and you&#39;ve had good grades all through the semester. And also 
don&#39;t forget me!&quot; She beamed merrily, in too good a mood to be let down 
by anybody else, and fortunately it was contagious. June sighed and 
reached up for her sister&#39;s hand.

&quot;I appreciate it, but you know...&quot;

&quot;Hey, I have faith that you&#39;ll walk again, and when you do, I&#39;ll want to 
dance with you and race you and do all sorts of stuff.&quot; June sighed, 
rubbing her legs as if it could revive them.

&quot;I&#39;ve been doubtful as of late, sis. And I&#39;m really trying, but it just 
seems hopeless. I may as well get used to this piece of junk.&quot; She 
leaned back and rolled her eyes. Her day got a little worse as she 
noticed something green hanging on the ceiling, placed there a few days 
earlier by her father (who &quot;tested it out&quot; on his wife).

&quot;Oh, drat,&quot; said June. May looked up and noticed the mistletoe.

&quot;Oh yeah. There&#39;s one tradition I can hate too. But hey, let&#39;s observe 
it just once. I&#39;ve never been kissed under the mistletoe before&#151;hey, 
what about Vicki? Don&#39;t you two, you know, get close and personal under 
these things?&quot;

&quot;She hates mistletoe,&quot; said June cheerfully. &quot;And so do I. We both feel 
that it isn&#39;t necessary for some plant to decide when to be romantic.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s the suddenness that counts. Being caught underneath it with 
another person, you know. So pucker up.&quot;

&quot;Ew, hey!&quot; June laughed and swatted at her sister as she knelt down. 
May&#39;s bright face was doing a good job of erasing her gloom, and 
honestly, June really did want her sister to kiss her. After all, when 
she was fifteen...

&quot;You know, I just realized something,&quot; said the elder seriously. &quot;We&#39;ve 
never actually kissed&#151;on the lips, I mean. I mean, shouldn&#39;t we be 
comfortable enough with each other to be okay with it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve seen Alisha and Erica kiss a few times,&quot; admitted June. She 
blushed and smiled, &quot;I have to admit, it looks kind of cute. 
I...wouldn&#39;t mind, you know.&quot;

&quot;First time for everything. I don&#39;t think it will make me a lesbian.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you got that covered with Janine.&quot; May snorted and slapped her 
sister&#39;s leg gently; she just laughed out loud. They soon became quiet, 
as quiet as snowfall, and shared a deep, sisterly stare&#151;the bond between 
them stronger because of their love. May chose to say nothing as she 
leaned in and placed her mouth on her sister&#39;s, and kept it there just 
long enough to know what her sibling tasted like. She pulled away, 
barely flushed, and smiled.

&quot;Whew, not bad. I can see why Vicki likes you!&quot;

&quot;Oh, stop it!&quot; They slapped each other playfully for a moment, and 
shared a hug&#151;June thanked May for being such a good sister, for staying 
with her during those lonely days, for encouraging her and loving her. 
She knew, too, it was time to tell her sister everything. She dared pull 
May in for another kiss and sighed once it was over.

&quot;Uh...May?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; She smiled, breathed in, and braced herself.

&quot;I, uh...um...I&#39;m...... I love you, May.&quot; She kissed her sister&#39;s 
forehead.

&quot;I love you too, June.&quot;

&quot;Not just as a sister.&quot; And now May was motionless. She could tell by 
the strength in June&#39;s eyes that her sister was very serious. She sighed 
and linked their hands together.

&quot;June, don&#39;t. No. We can&#39;t. You know that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. I just...wanted to say it. I needed to. I&#39;ve been sort of 
carrying that around for three years. I, uh...I hope you&#39;re not too 
awkward about it.&quot;

&quot;A bit,&quot; confessed May with a smile, &quot;mostly because I didn&#39;t really 
expect it. I mean, I know we love each other, but...jeez, June. We&#39;re 
sisters. And even if we weren&#39;t related, you still have a girlfriend, 
and I&#39;m straight!&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; May could not answer that at first. She really had to 
think about it. Her sister had been bold with her honesty, so how could 
she do any less with hers?

&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot;

&quot;Janine?&quot; May nodded.

&quot;Kula&#39;s been flirting with me too, but...yeah. Janine.&quot;

&quot;Are you in love with her?&quot; She chuckled quietly.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to say that, but...I&#39;m definitely attracted to 
her a bit. Just a bit.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yeah right. I know how you two make out, I&#39;ve seen you. You can 
barely control yourselves.&quot;

&quot;Hey, don&#39;t be spying on us!&quot; she screeched, pushing June&#39;s chair so 
hard it rolled back. Tramble shrieked and stopped herself, then glared 
at her sister.

&quot;If I fall out of this thing, you&#39;ll have to carry me wherever I want to 
go!&quot;

&quot;Just don&#39;t do it on purpose,&quot; snorted May. June gave her a coy look, 
winked, and wheeled back to her original position. She sighed and rested 
her head in her hands.

&quot;Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that. You&#39;re right, we shouldn&#39;t have 
a relationship together.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; said May fondly, &quot;it&#39;s not really what you think. I&#39;m more 
concerned about Vicki. She loves you. If you two weren&#39;t together, I&#39;d 
seriously consider it!&quot;

&quot;God!&quot; blurted an indignant girl, &quot;You really don&#39;t mean that, do you?&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s passed my mind, I&#39;ll admit!&quot; chuckled May playfully&#151;not 
indicating at all whether she really meant it or not. &quot;Let&#39;s face it, 
there are some people who wonder what it&#39;d be like to have sex with 
their clone or whatever. I&#39;m just one of them, and you&#39;re as close as a 
clone as I&#39;ll get.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re unnatural!&quot; shrieked June, her face nearly broken from the big 
smile on it. &quot;Mabel Romia Tramble, I never thought I&#39;d hear those words 
from your mouth!&quot;

&quot;Hey, you said you were the one with a crush on me.&quot;

&quot;It was...that was...you know I didn&#39;t mean...May, that was three years 
ago!&quot; May laughed and gave her sister a fond kiss on her cheek. All in 
good play. She caressed the younger girl&#39;s face gently, smiling and 
sharing intimate eye contact.

&quot;I am a little curious,&quot; she admitted. June turned faint red. &quot;Just a 
little. I&#39;m not as easy to predict as I appear. I was serious when I 
said it&#39;s passed my mind before. Some nights I really wondered what it&#39;d 
be like to have sex with you. Do you think those were lesbian vibes, or 
incest vibes, or just unnatural vibes coming through?&quot;

&quot;Unnatural, like you.&quot; June made a face and ruffled her sister&#39;s hair. 
&quot;Besides, like you said, Vicki... We couldn&#39;t. I really do love her.&quot; 
They smiled and took each other&#39;s hands. May dared to share a third kiss 
between them&#151;but she kept her mouth there much, much longer than before, 
like she had done with Janine several times before. She really had 
wondered what it was like to kiss June, at least that much, and 
everything else... Perhaps the result of a sexually inexperienced young 
girl who allowed her mind to wander when she was alone in her bed?

May felt June&#39;s tongue poke shyly out of its fleshy shell, knowing that 
her sister&#39;s inhibitions were fading, her &quot;unnatural&quot; desires were 
baring themselves, and her subconscious mind was winning over reason. 
She allowed the soft pink muscle inside her mouth and gave herself to 
her sister; she lifted June&#39;s sweater up and discarded it on the bed. 
One of them suggested going to their room, perhaps to continue or to 
stop altogether, but they went there regardless and for the rest of the 
evening, learned new things about each other that even they, as twin 
sisters, never knew before.

.........

The following day, it was unanimously decided between the two of them 
that first, their activities would be kept a secret between themselves, 
and second, they would never partake in them again. June had Victoria, 
after all&#151;as her sister put it, &quot;a more sensible prospect&quot;&#151;and May, it 
seemed, could possibly have a future down another path as well. They 
went to school in a good mood, amidst the gray skies, silver bells, and 
falling snow, and split up for classes. Along the way, May found Janine, 
who was also in a cheery mood. They waved at each other and approached 
for a hug.

&quot;Can I ask you something?&quot; said Bautista.

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;My friends are getting together at my place for Christmas and New 
Year&#39;s, and I was wondering if you and June would like to come as well.&quot;

&quot;Well, you can&#39;t count all your friends if we&#39;re not there, right?&quot; 
Janine smiled.

&quot;You&#39;ve got a point. That makes me glad. Be sure to tell your sister 
after class, all right?&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot; The tardy bell rang, so they scurried inside Madsen&#39;s class. 
Oddly enough, as Zane later pointed out, their beloved teacher was 
nowhere in sight.

&quot;It&#39;s not like her to be this late,&quot; added Klein.

&quot;You think she got caught in the snow?&quot;

&quot;No, I saw her earlier. She was hanging around Miss Keeping.&quot; A few of 
the girls snickered, knowing full well what that meant.

Meanwhile, safely locked in a bathroom stall, Hitomi Madsen was lost in 
her girlfriend&#39;s administrations, unaware of the time that had passed. 
Abby had worn a mistletoe hat to school, and far be it from Hitomi to 
not put it to good use.
