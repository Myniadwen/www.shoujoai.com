<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 5 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/artemis-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>      Jess Drake caught the tossed beer bottle casually
from midair, the black haired woman&#39;s eyes narrowed
angrily. Around her the brawl raged on, fists being
thrown, chairs busted and the Daughters of Artemis
filled with noisy chaos. With a scowl she forced her
way towards the bar itself, blinking in surprise as
she saw Diana and Circe calmly serving drinks.

      &quot;I keep forgetting that you do this every year,&quot; Jess
commented, settling her leather covered arms down on
the polished counter. Her short skirt hugged her hips
sinfully, the glossy leather jacket shining in the
light.

      Circe chuckled, her long blonde hair up on her head
in a stylized crown. &quot;It&#39;s a tradition,&quot; she
explained, &quot;not to mention fun.&quot;

      &quot;You have a interesting idea of fun,&quot; Jess remarked.

      Diana smirked, her brown hair flowing down her back,
unusually long this week. &quot;What, punching someone in
the teeth isn&#39;t your idea of fun?&quot; she asked.

      &quot;Generally, no,&quot; Jess answered firmly. She snagged a
beer while tossing the empty she caught into the bin,
drinking deep the strong and foamy brew.

      &quot;So where&#39;s your pretty little friend tonight?&quot; Circe
asked curiously, her casual t-shirt tightly clinging
to her body.

      &quot;At home, I assume,&quot; Jess said flatly, her tone of
voice making it very clear that she did not want to
talk about it.

      &#39;Trouble in paradise,&#39; Diana noted. &quot;Do me a favor
and don&#39;t do anything too stupid tonight,&quot; she
cautioned Jess softly.

      &quot;Never do,&quot; Jess headed into the madly fighting
crowd, casually belting someone who got a bit too
close to her.

      &quot;Think she sabotaged herself again?&quot; Circe
speculated, a quick glare reminding a customer that
damaging this section of the bar was a bad idea.

      &quot;She does tend to do that,&quot; Diana sighed. Her lips
twitched up in a slight smile as she quoted, &quot;What
fools these mortals be.&quot;

      &quot;Eep!&quot; the petite little redhead squealed out as she
was yanked right across the taller woman&#39;s lap,
several hard blows landing on her jeans clad bottom
white she kicked her legs vigoroously. Oddly she was
grinning, clearly enjoying the rough treatmennt.

      &quot;I told you not to spill the drink, Casey,&quot; Nycole
scolded, her mane of black hair falling in glistening
waves down her back. Her rings and necklace glinted in
the glow of a nearby light, her lips curled up in a
smile.

      &quot;I&#39;m very sorry, ma&#39;am,&quot; Casey rubbed at her bottom,
batting her green eyes as she looked up at Nycole
adoringly from where she knelt beside the woman&#39;s
chair.

      Nycole reached out a delicate hand to trace the thin
leather collar that Casey always wore. &quot;I wonder if I
should take this off,&quot; she mused, &quot;removing the
enchantment that hides your true form.&quot;

      &quot;I think my fur would draw some reactions,&quot; Casey
offered softly, &quot;not to mention the fangs and claws,
my mistress.&quot;

      &quot;Do you ever regret that I bound you so, my little
one?&quot; Nycole asked, meeting those green eyes with her
own dark brown ones.

      Casey smiled as she answered honestly, &quot;No, milady.&quot;
At Nycole&#39;s raised eyebrow she continued, &quot;I was a
savenger, living off the wastes of this world and the
few small beasts I could catch. With you, for the
first time, I am well fed and taken care of.&quot;

      &quot;In return for your service to me,&quot; Nycole reminded
her.

      Casey nodded. &quot;But I do not find that service so
difficult,&quot; she murmured softly, &quot;not when I serve one
such as you.&quot;

      &quot;Flatterer,&quot; Nycole hissed, eyes flashing. She
grabbed Casey and forcefully yanked the smaller woman
forward, kissing her fiercely.

      &quot;Hmm, Mistress,&quot; Casey cooed once they parted.

      &quot;We&#39;re going home,&quot; Nycole purred into the girl&#39;s
ear, &quot; and I&#39;m going to take that collar off you, so
that we can really play.&quot;

      Casey mewed softly as Nycole&#39;s tongue snaked out,
unnaturally long, to twist around the curve of her
ear. &quot;I&#39;m looking forward to it,&quot; she answered.

      &quot;You know,&quot; Alex rabbit punched the brawler fast,
sensing him crashing to the ground with a thump, &quot;I
didn&#39;t plan a night like this.&quot; The redhead scanned
the room confidently with green eyes, her stance that
of a seasoned fighter.

      Jasmine laughed, forcefully bringing a chair down on
top of the head of another fighter, wood pieces flying
everywhere as he dropped. &quot;Sorry love,&quot; she pushed
long violet hair back with her ever present white
gloved hands, &quot;I just thought you knew what this place
was like over New Years.&quot;

      &quot;I may not have planned this but I have to admit,
it&#39;s fun,&quot; Alex ducked a punch, taking advantage of
the woman&#39;s poor balance to yank her off her feet,
flinging her to one side. &quot;Want to grab a drink, at
least?&quot; she asked.

      Jasmine panted softly from her exertions, her full,
round breasts rising and falling quite distractedly
underneath her tight little red dress. She noticed
where Alex&#39;s eyes had focusded and grinned in
satisfaction, pure white teeth glinting in the light.
&quot;Of course,&quot; she gently took Alex&#39;s hand as they
headed up to the bar.

      &quot;I&#39;m glad that you meant it,&quot; Alex said to her
quietly, &quot;when you said you wanted to see me again
after our little date.&quot;

      &quot;You underestimate your charms, Alex,&quot; Jasmine
answered simply, a look from her convincing a goon not
to mess with them, &quot;I really enjoyed our first date.&quot;
Looking amused she added, &quot;Not to mention how creative
you are in bed.&quot;

      &quot;I can&#39;t believe you said that,&quot; Alex blushed.

      Jasmine chuckled as they reached the bar, &quot;It&#39;s the
honest truth.&quot; A bit more hesitantly she added, &quot;And
I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t have issues with what I do for a
living.&quot;

      &quot;I did at first,&quot; Alex quietly admitted as they
placed their orders, &quot;until a friend explained to me
what you normally do.&quot;

      &quot;I did break my rule with you,&quot; Jasmine admitted
fondly.

      Jasmine wasn&#39;t, technically, a prostitute, though
what she did was close. As a professional escort she
would go out with someone, provide pleasant and
entertaining company but not actually sleep with them.
That was also what she had been hired to do with Alex,
but the night and the company had carried her away.

      &quot;You two look good,&quot; Circe chuckled as she served
them their drinks. She looked at them impishly,
&quot;Having fun tonight?&quot;

      &quot;Alex didn&#39;t know about your  tradition,&quot; Jasmine
smiled warmly at her companion, &quot;I almost thought she
was going to whip out badge and gun and start making
arrests.&quot;

      &quot;It looked like a riot,&quot; Alex shrugged casually.

      &quot;You could say that about more than one night here,&quot;
Diana commented as she swept by, passing a drink to
another customer.

      Jasmine chuckled at Alex&#39;s look. &quot;You should have
been here the last time Jess Drake had a bad night,&quot;
she confided, &quot;all hell broke loose.&quot;

      Surprisingly, the ongoing sounds of battle gradually
declined, eventually replaced by an ominous silence.
Turning their heads the group of women standing at the
bar were greeted by a most unusual sight.

      The floor were littered with both men and women, the
fighters some of whom had been brawling for most of
the night. The last figure standing swayed a bit,
black hair falling down over a bruised right eye. Her
jacket was hanging odff one corner and the slinky
dress had a rip up one side.

      &quot;Peace and quiet at last,&quot; Jess Drake sighed,
casually letting go of the last mann she had been
pummeling. She felt their eyes on her and raised an
defiant eyebrow, &quot;What?&quot;</pre>
