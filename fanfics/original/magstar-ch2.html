<h1>Magic Star Warriors: The Dark Force Era (part 2 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/magstar-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>7th street, early morning

Two girls walk down the peaceful and calm residential area of 7th 
street, on the crisp Friday morning, two girls known as Keiya Shindo 
and Yai Kitana, are about to embark on journey, with will seal their 
fates forever. But little do they know, that this has nothing do with 
being a magic star soldier.

As Yai walked on with Keiya, the two locked in an unnerving silence, 
her thoughts began to run wild. After all, she did have a lot to think 
about. Just two days ago, she was the mild-mannered, chestnut haired 
girl, Yai Kitana. She lived with her mom and dad, had a great 
boyfriend, with&#133;semi good grades at school in her belief. She had tons 
of friends and lived a normal, average and stress-free life. But now, 
everything was different. Everything had changed.

Ever since she met had met Keiya, there had been a chain reaction of 
events. The murder of Mesumi, They&#146;re meeting at Keneda high School, 
their quick friendship, the demon attack at school and the actual 
event that shaped her destiny.  

Her fateful transformation into the goddess of love and peace, the 
magic Starsoldier known as Lovestar. 
 
Those four events had turned her life upside down.  She now had the 
duty of protecting the earth from a horde of fanatical demon-beasts 
who intend to take over the planet. These vile creatures are known as 
the Darkforce. They operate on a gigantic asteroid, which orbits the 
earth. That is a big problem but it wasn&#146;t the major weight on her 
mind, Not at all. That was Keiya.

The event that happened on the first day they met each other. It 
didn&#146;t seem to be a significant problem 2 days ago but now, all the 
feelings and all the tension from that point had come back in full 
fashion. It was the point at which they almost&#133;almost&#133;no! She couldn&#146;t 
bring herself to belief that that could happen&#133;not to her. But she 
could not deny what she felt. She had to organize and prioritize her 
feelings now. She had to resolve this. Keiya couldn&#146;t run away from 
her like she did yesterday. This was the time to sort out all of her 
thoughts. 

As two walked on, Yai suddenly stopped moving. Startled, Keiya also 
stopped, turning around to face Yai. She had a lot on her mind and 
Keiya could sense this. Finding out you&#146;re a magic star soldier can be 
tough, considering the drastic change of lifestyle which follows 
transforming into one and she is young, she is only sixteen, and that 
is a massive responsibility to take on at this age. 

But Keiya had to let Yai know that she would always be here for her 
now, no matter what challenges lie ahead, or anything that might get 
between them.

&#147;Yai&#133;are you okay?&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#148;

She didn&#146;t answer. She just kept her head down, looking down at the 
stone pavement of the near silent street. She looked as though she was 
trying to gather her thoughts.  Keiya carefully stepped toward her, 
and rested her hand on Yai&#146;s shoulder. But when Yai flinched at her 
touch, she became seriously worried about her.

&#147;Yai&#133;w-what&#146;s wrong&#133;? Have I done something wrong? Did I do something 
to upset you&#133;I&#133;&#148;?

But before Keiya could finish talking, Yai stepped in. 

&#147;We need to talk.&#148;

Keiya&#146;s worry eased a bit when she assumed Yai was worried about being 
a magic star soldier again.

&#147;&#133;I know being a magic star soldier is overwhelming&#133;with powers like 
the ones we have, a new, even greater responsibility must follow 
it&#133;but I want you to know I &#133;&#148;

Again before Keiya could finish speaking, Yai cut in.

&#147;It&#146;s not about that.&#148;

&#147;Then what is it?&#148;

Yai looked up at Keiya with a strange glare. Her shining emerald eyes 
were now infused with worry and paranoia. She looked as though she was 
half way between erupting in a fit of rage and breaking down, falling 
to her knees and weeping. 

&#147;It&#146;s&#133;It&#146;s about us.&#148; 

Yai could hear her voice creaking but she had to go on. She had to 
know. Keiya&#146;s downplayed worry transformed into confusion, but after a 
light twinge in her stomach, she came to the correct conclusion. All 
the worry and angst from yesterday made an unwelcome return. 

&#147;&#133;W-what do you mean&#133;?&#148;

&#147;&#133;You know perfectly well what I mean. Remember the day before 
yesterday?  Only 3 blocks away from here? You&#133;you know what happened.&#148;

Keiya felt her body tense and stiffen, and the fear that was welded 
into her being was now multiplying a thousand fold. She found herself 
slowly turning away from Yai&#146;s gaze. 

&#147;Nothing&#133;nothing happened Yai&#133;&#148;

&#147;How can you say that?&#148;

Yai felt anger seep into her words as she spoke and decided to calm 
herself.

&#147;&#133;What happened between us was not nothing.&#148;

&#147;Yai. It&#146;s&#133;It&#146;s natural to have odd or uncomfortable situations 
between new friends. There is so little we know about each other. The 
real task is the way we approach the problem&#133;how we deal with it&#133;it 
meant nothing&#133;you know that.&#148;

&#147;Do you honestly believe that?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Yes. I do. I mean, if we really did&#133;feel anything for each other, 
don&#146;t you think we would have felt something beforehand?&#148;

&#147;Well&#133; yeah but&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yai&#133;I can understand what&#146;s wrong worrying you&#133;but I&#146;m telling you&#133;it 
doesn&#146;t mean anything&#133;you know that don&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;Yeah. I guess I do.&#148;

Keiya moved toward Yai and rested both her hands on Yai&#146;s shoulders, 
trying to reassure her of her words. She smiled to her weakly, but it 
was enough to show Yai that she believed it to be the truth. Although 
neither one truly believed her words, it was quick release from that 
concept. Those words made it easier for them to except what happened 
between the two of them. Some of the tension began to ease and Yai 
started to loosen up as Keiya&#146;s words sunk in.

&#147;&#133;Well I guess it must be true then, I&#146;d have a hard time explaining 
this to my boyfriend!&#148;

Keiya suddenly released Yai&#146;s shoulders and her reassuring smile 
dissolved into a frown.

&#147;You&#133;you have a boyfriend?&#148;

&#147;Well yeah. He&#146;s my little sweetheart! His name is Akira.&#148;

&#147;Oh. Well that&#146;s great. Come on lets go to class.&#148;


Keneda high school

9.00 am. As people moved in and out of each building, scrambling to 
get to their respective classes before being late. Yai, Keiya, Hisaka 
and Yumi met up at the front gate and headed toward Mr. Hinoba&#146;s 
class.

When they got there and sat down, Mr. Hinoba as usual had locked 
himself away in world full of papers and files. 

&#147;That guy needs a life.&#148; Yai thought to herself.

She had absolutely no idea about what those papers were about, along 
with Hisaka, but Yumi could guess.

&#147;&#133;The math exams&#133;&#148;

This statement seemed to unlock the ever so fragile memory of Hisaka.

&#147;Oh my god! Your right! It must be the math exams!!!&#148;

&#147;Calm down Hisaka, I&#146;m sure you did fine.&#148; Said Yai.

&#147;Easy for you to say Yai, I bent over backwards to study and I&#146;m still 
worried about my result.&#148;

&#147;Well you know who the lucky one is here. Keiya. She didn&#146;t even have 
to take the exams!&#148; Yumi joked.

Yumi then turned around to look back at Keiya, but she was staring 
thoughtfully out of the window.

&#147;Yai has a boyfriend&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Keiya?&#148;

No answer. She remained silent. What ever she was thinking about had 
absorbed all of her attention.

&#147;Hey, Keiya!&#148;

&#147;&#133;Huh&#133;?&#148;

Yumi&#146;s call snapped Keiya out of her trance-like reverie. She turned 
to look at Yai, who was talking to Hisaka about something or other, 
and then she turned back to Yumi. 
  
&#147;Oh&#133;it&#146;s you Yumi. I&#146;m sorry, I guess I&#146;m just a little withdrawn.&#148;

&#147;Are you okay? You&#146;ve been acting a little strangely this morning.&#148;

&#147;No. Don&#146;t worry I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

Yumi then turned round and started talking to Yai and Hisaka again. 
Keiya then shook her head trying to gather herself. She stared at Yai 
who was talking to Hisaka and Yumi about something. She seemed 
perfectly fine now, as though what happened between them had simply 
rolled of her back and had become an irrelevant memory. Keiya was 
always good at convincing others about certain things, like she did 
with Yai. However, she could not so easily convince herself of the 
things she spoke of. 

&#147;Why does it bother me so much?&#148;  Keiya thought to herself

&#147;I said it myself. What happened between us didn&#146;t mean anything. So 
why don&#146;t I believe it? Why can&#146;t I stop thinking about it? Stop it 
Keiya Shindo! This is nuts. I&#133;I don&#146;t&#133;no&#133;I can&#146;t feel anything for 
Yai&#133;she&#146;s a girl! But I&#146;ve never felt as anything like this 
before&#133;She&#146;s just so beautiful&#133;uhr! No! Stop thinking like that! What 
would others think of me if they knew&#133;and it&#146;s not like I can&#146;t get a 
guy. Tons of them have asked me out since I came to Keneda high 
school. But I don&#146;t want any of them&#133;I just want&#133; Yai&#133;no! I must stop 
it! I&#146;m being ridiculous. I have duties. As a Magic Starsoldier, I 
have to protect the planet. That comes before personal feelings. And I 
know that these feelings I have will only cloud my judgment and 
interfere with my mission. But I can&#146;t deny what I feel&#133;this feeling 
is strong than me&#133;I just cant stop thinking about her&#133;&#148; 

Mr. Hinoba cut Keiya&#146;s thoughts short when he stood up and spoke to 
the class.

&#147;Alright now class, settle down please. You see these papers in my 
hand? These are the Math examinations that you took in two weeks ago. 
And I&#146;m pleased to say that most of you did exceptionally well. 
However I will issue them to you at the end of class. Oh and by the 
way, Miss Kitana?&#148;

&#147;Huh? What is it?&#148;

&#147;I need to speak with you after school.&#148;

&#147;Okay &#133;sure&#133;&#148; 
 
Later on at the end of the day, Mr. Hinoba gave out the results of the 
test.  Hisaka surprisingly got 72%, which isn&#146;t great but with having 
the reputation on being a bit of a flake, 72% doesn&#146;t seem to be that 
bad. Yumi who secretly studied like crazy also, got an 85%, which se 
was quite pleased with.  However Yai didn&#146;t fair as well as the others 
and she got 59%, which is a seriously low result, considering the 
class average was 78% so Yai assumed this was the reason for Mr. 
Hinoba asking her to stay behind. 

Later after class and after everyone left, Yai was sitting on a desk 
while Mr. Hinoba was in is little world again, completely oblivious to 
the events taking place behind him. 

&#147;Aah&#133;Mr. Hinoba&#133;?

&#147;Huh? Oh right Miss Kitana. Now then, this is probably just a blip in 
your grades but I&#146;m still worried about this poor result. It&#146;s not 
like you to get such a low grade. That&#146;s why I have come to the 
conclusion that you need a tutor. &#147;

&#147;What? A tutor? It&#146;s just one low exam result!&#148; 

&#147;I know it seems a little foolish in your eyes but this you&#146;re future 
and failing in math doesn&#146;t help it. You need a tutor to assure you 
can pull yourself back up.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Who is it.&#148;?

&#147;Miss Hiramu could you come in please?&#148;

Yai turned to the door and saw her old friend Alana Hiramu. Yai had 
known her since kindergarten, and they grew up together as life long 
friends.  She was the same age as Yai was, and was around the same 
height. Her blonde hair was tied into a long French braid like it 
always was. That&#146;s what you&#146;d expect from Alana. She never had a 
change of pace. But that was one of the reasons Yai liked her so much. 

She hadn&#146;t spoken to Alana for quite some time, mostly because of the 
fact they were in different classes, Yai was in the middle set, and 
Alana was in the top set (the brain class). And that nowadays, all she 
seemed to be doing was disappearing acts during the time they spent 
together. At least this would give them chance to catch up.

&#147;Alana?&#148; Yai said.

&#147;Hiya Yai!&#148;

&#147;Wow. You&#146;re my tutor? Well at least they gave me someone I like. How 
are you? I haven&#146;t spoken to you days!&#148;

Alana the walked over to the desk Yai was sitting on and sat on the 
one next to it.

&#147;I&#146;m doing just fine. How about you? You got 59%? That&#146;s not like 
you.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, I guess I pulled a &#145;Hisaka&#146;!&#148;

The two girls chuckled at the joke and Mr. Hinoba interrupted by 
coughing into his fist. 

&#147;Yes that&#146;s all well and good. Now Miss Hiramu I want you to be Miss 
Kitana&#146;s tutor for the next two weeks. We&#146;ll see from their where we 
go.&#148;  

&#147;Okay sir. I&#146;ll get cracking on Yai right now!&#148;

Later that day, at around 6.20, Yai and Alana had been studying in the 
library for around 2 hours. Alana seemed to be having the time of her 
life, which is why she&#146;s so smart. She loved that kind of thing.  Yai 
however, seemed to be having a hard time keeping up with her words. 
But soon she felt something. It was troubling Yai, it was a hard tense 
feeling. Like a thick fog was descending on the area surrounding her. 
Yai felt herself become more and more distracted by this feeling she 
was experiencing.&#148;

&#147;This&#133;feeling&#133;what is it&#133;wait! Last night Keiya said I could sense 
demons around me&#133;like a signal to transform. But if a human is 
possessed, it can&#146;t be sensed directly. That means this creature&#133;&#148;

&#147;Alana I need to leave for a second.&#148;

&#147;Huh? Why?&#148;

&#147;Oh&#133;um&#133;ladies room&#133;that&#146;s right ladies room.&#148;

&#147;Oh. Well by all means go, just be quick.&#148;

Yai quickly ran out of the library and down the hall. She had no idea 
were she was going to, but she trusted in her senses. Eventually she 
ran out into the school field, which had been deserted and Yai was 
sure no one had seen her. However there seemed to be nobody there. 
Were her senses wrong? No. The enemy must be hiding. So she decided to 
transform. 

&#147;Lovestar power&#133;transform!!&#148;

In a flash of white light, Yai Kitana transformed into the goddess of 
love and peace, Lovestar. Lovestar then ran further into the field to 
get a better view of her surroundings. 

&#147;&#133;Show yourself agent of the Darkforce!!!&#148;

Still nothing. But the she heard a sound behind her. She turned round 
to face a very strange man. He was quite tall, and was wearing a heavy 
and dark suit with a velvet cape attached to it with two large 
metallic plates on both sides of his shoulders.   His arms were 
crossed, and his short and spiky black hair was blowing in the breeze. 
His eyes possessed a gleaming red, and had a small scar, which 
overlapped his left cheek. His menacing smile confirmed who served 
under. The Darkforce. Although he didn&#146;t seem to be physically 
stronger then the demon she fought yesterday, she knew he was very 
powerful. She could tell by the large dark aura he possessed.

&#147;Who are you? You belong to them don&#146;t you?  Answer me!!!&#148;

&#147;Heh, heh, heh&#133;I am known as Tanzanite&#133;I am one of the four generals 
of her highness Queen Asumasa.&#148;

&#147;Asumasa&#133;?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s right. With the help of the four talismans and a little human 
energy, she will lead us to the succession of the lunatic andromeda. 
But you see, for some reason, Her highness has some sort of fear of 
your kind, magic star soldier&#133;but that where I come in. she has given 
me the task of destroying you and I will succeed...&#148;

&#147;I will fight you with all my strength you demon!&#148;   

&#147;Heh, heh. I am not your ordinary warrior&#133;&#148;

Lovestar, slightly annoyed at this guy&#146;s confidence, rushed forward to 
attack. Although this would only be her second battle, she felt as 
though she knew what to do, how to attack, like these powers were 
tattooed into her brain. She ran towards and attempted to punch 
Tanzanite, and he dodged it effortlessly, smirking at her with an evil 
glint. Lovestar again tried to hit him by unleashing a flurry of 
punches all of which the dark general blocked at each turn.  Lovestar 
then crouched to the ground and attempted to sweep Tanzanite, however 
he simply leapt into the air, right over the Goddess of love and 
peace&#146;s leg. When landed behind her, she swung her fist at him but 
with lightning fast speed he caught her fist inches away from his 
temple, and laughed at her. 

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! So this is the famous power of the magic star 
soldiers? Ha! I gotta&#146; say I&#146;m not impressed!&#148;

&#147;Why you&#133;how dare you mock me?&#148;

Lovestar&#146;s anger began to erupt as she spoke. She then swung her leg 
over the air that caught her fist and held it tight as she tugged at 
it. She fell back as she pulled Tanzanite forward. Startled he let go 
of her fist, but at this point, she had a good hold on his body. She 
then hurled him into the air as she landed on her back, and he landed 
a few feet away from her. Slowly they both stood up, but to Lovestar&#146;s 
surprise, he was still smiling&#133;

&#147;Heh, heh, heh&#133;not bad.&#148; He said while wiping some blood of the corner 
of his mouth with his fist. &#147;But I guess I&#146;ll show you a few tricks of 
my own&#133;&#148;   

Slowly, Alana packed up and decided to go look for Yai. She had been 
gone for around 10 minutes, and she was starting to get worried.

She left the library and was walking down the corridor. Suddenly she 
saw a massive bang of light emanating from the school fields. She ran 
towards this light and as she approached the field she saw two 
figures, both firing energy attacks at each other and they seemed to 
be in a desperate struggle for power. At that moment, Alana Hiramu 
knew what she had to do.

Lovestar had fired her powerful &#145;crushing love blast&#146; attack to 
counter his ice flame attack but neither one was strong enough to stop 
the other.  As the two forces seesawed in strength, the ground below 
them suddenly started to separate and crack. Lovestar felt the sweat 
from her forehead trail down her face. This was draining a lot of her 
energy. She was new at this, but she had to keep going.

No matter how powerful she was, she had to survive. If not for herself 
but for her family and friends who were counting on her to protect 
them. 

&#147;Give up magic star soldier&#133;you&#146;re finished!!!&#148;

As soon as Tanzanite stopped speaking, an unknown figure appeared.

&#147;I am Sunstar, the champion of knowledge and goddess of the sun, and 
now I must destroy you!&#148;

&#147;Why you&#133;little&#133;&#148;

Sunstar then lifted her arm into the air and began to gather energy in 
her fingertip. A small barrier formed around hand and then she pointed 
it directly at Tanzanite. 

&#147;Shining Sunset Beam!!!&#148;

A piercing beam of golden energy shot out from Sunstar and cut through 
the air. With lightning fast speed, the beam cut through the dark 
generals shoulder ripping of his shoulder plate and exposing blood 
soaked flesh. This blow shattered Tanzanite&#146;s concentration and gave 
Lovestar the opportunity she needed to overpower him. The Crushing 
Love Blast catapulted Tanzanite into a nearby bike shed. Sunstar then 
ran beside Lovestar who herself was shocked to find that there was 
another magic star soldier. 

Then the dark general Tanzanite crawled out of the wreck that once was 
once a bike shed. He stood weakly, clutching his injured shoulder, 
which was now bleeding uncontrollably.

&#147;You&#133;you bimbo&#146;s!! I will destroy you soon enough if I cant now. I 
already have one of the four talismans needed. Soon I will bring our 
Queen&#146;s plan to fruition and your world will be ours!!  
Hahahahahahahah!!!!!!!&#148;

Tanzanite laughed maniacally, then teleported out of the scene. 
Lovestar and Sunstar then eased a bit but as quickly as she calmed 
down, her mind refilled with Questions. 

&#147;Wait a minute&#133;who are you?&#148;

&#147;&#133;I am Sunstar. I am also a magic star soldier&#133;and you are&#133;?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m Lovestar&#133;&#148;

&#147;Well you are quite powerful, but I think you need to know you have a 
few weaknesses. One is that you haven&#146;t yet learned how to control 
your enormous powers.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Can you train me&#133;?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Well you are so in tune with your own powers, I just want to be like 
that. Will you please&#133;?&#148;

&#147;&#133;Well okay&#133;it gets lonely as a magic star soldier.&#148;

&#147;That reminds me. There is someone else apart from us and I&#146;d like to 
introduce you to her.&#148;
