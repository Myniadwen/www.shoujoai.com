<h1>All Girls School (part 21 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>&quot;Usha and Blake&quot;

Usha Krishnan&#39;s first date was with the girl she had had a crush on for 
a whole year&#151;really a success story gone right. Blake Baum&#39;s first date 
was with a girl she barely knew, who had the gay naivet&eacute; to just walk up 
and ask her out, and later, she dated a girl who had apparently liked 
her in secret, yet had not the nerve to reveal her feelings until then. 
Mira van Dijk&#39;s first date was with Blake, and her tenth was with Usha.

By this point, any outside observer could&#39;ve concluded that it was 
Blake, none other, that Usha had liked for so long. Their exploits, 
first as strangers and second as girlfriends, were strange and peculiar, 
meriting a story in their own right. Starting from the day Usha first 
realized she liked Blake might&#39;ve been poor, for too long a time was 
spread out between that day and the day they went on their first date 
together. But it was as good a place as any to begin, and all good 
stories usually start out at their origin anyway.

Blake had been playing sports since before she met any of her four close 
friends. Riddled with a poor attention span and restlessness, her 
parents recommended something that would keep her busy and off the 
couch. They introduced her to soccer, which she did very poorly in until 
the day she became attracted to running. It was so generic and simple, 
and she could focus everything into it without really having to focus at 
all. When she got tired, she stopped and observed the world. When she 
caught her breath, she went on. Blake quickly found herself a natural, 
and soon won awards for her efforts in elementary school and subsequent 
middle school races.

She got back into soccer around the 7th grade, and although she found 
herself average in general, she was an excellent runner and carried her 
team far in several games. She soon became a valuable player, and in her 
freshman year of high school, became Stanton&#39;s MVP (her position was now 
up for grabs in sophomore year; she predicted Zane Klein would win it). 
It was during one of these glorious games, the run for the championship 
(which the Badgers won), where a certain young woman with a passion paid 
attention to the sport, and the players, and the unassuming young girl 
who helped escalate her team.

Usha and Blake knew each other by reputation only, but a year after 
Stanton&#39;s opening game in their championship run, they would know each 
other better.

Blake knew most of her teammates well, and considered them friends, 
although none were as close as her &quot;big four&quot;. Aintzane &quot;Zane&quot; Klein was 
eccentric and aggressive, a woman who could&#39;ve played football and been 
perfectly at home, but since Stanton didn&#39;t offer the sport (nor rugby), 
she chose soccer. Zane was not nearly as good at running as Blake, but 
she was the offensive heart and the goal-scoring soul of the team. 
Alexis &quot;X&quot; Walker was very nearly as aggressive; combined, the two women 
mowed down their opponents like wrecking balls.

Ivory Tran, not quite as physical, was still quick and had excellent 
balance, and she had a keen eye for the ball and a noticeable sixth 
sense when it came to strategy. Jocelyn McKeough didn&#39;t look like she 
belonged on the field, but she was speedy and certainly the most 
spirited of the team. Kathlyn Parkin, the newcomer, was a goalie 
unparalleled, despite her asthmatic weakness, and Leena K., their mentor 
and coach, was enjoyable and lovely and tough and inspirational all at 
once. The Stanton Badgers were strong, and beloved, and admired&#151;but one 
in particular was held in high regard outside.

Usha had a crush on Blake long before she realized it. People would&#39;ve 
asked why the eloquent, sophisticated woman with a future would &quot;waste 
her time&quot; with a common, everyday girl who seemed uninterested in high 
society, but Usha was very different and had a very unorthodox outlook 
on things. Her love and admiration of Mira, her newest political rival, 
proved she respected people and had the sense to admire talent when she 
saw it; her longtime &quot;fanship&quot; of Blake proved that even she cared for 
more than just the latest opinions and social happenings.

Blake Freda Baum, her full name, was an inch shorter than Usha and a 
year younger, but considerably more athletic. Her legs were especially 
molded and perfected into pillars; her waist was within reasonable 
feminine width and her arms were thin but strong. She never wore skirts 
or anything that revealed her bust, and her hair was the color of 
falling autumn leaves, rusty and golden with reddish hue and a drop of 
brown. She wore clothes according to each season: green and blue for 
spring, colors similar to her hair in autumn; black in winter, white in 
summer. Anyone could see her physical traits; Usha wanted to know the 
deeper things.

What did this girl like, besides track? Why was she so embarrassed about 
her figure? Her legs were strong and her chest, though petite, was 
nothing to be shy about. Did she read, watch movies, walk, go to the 
mall, swim, what? Was she interested in girls? Did she have a boyfriend? 
What was her type? What were her weaknesses, her fears, the things that 
made her angry or unhappy? What...

Usha sighed. The crowds in the bleachers roared. Another goal for 
Walker. Blake didn&#39;t even look winded. Parkin looked like she had walked 
through a tornado. Leena was unreadable. She badly wanted to go over and 
embrace dear Blake, simply because she liked the girl and wanted, 
wanted, wanted so much to know her, to be with someone so totally unlike 
her, to be... But it was a fantasy. Usha didn&#39;t even think she had a 
crush on her. It was just admiration, all for a woman in sports. A 
female athlete and a female politician. It was her secret fantasy, and 
it would not come true. Not that day, at least.

One day, Usha chose not to watch the game. She reasoned her obligation 
was with the GSA. She had never seen Blake attend any of those meetings, 
which further led her to believe&#151;maybe&#151;she didn&#39;t have a chance&#151;but ah, 
a chance at what? Was she gay, or bisexual&#151;or just puzzled? Puzzled. 
Definitely puzzled.

The next day was harder, and easier. Mira had smiled at her yesterday, 
during the meeting. She had attended every day since she learned about 
it, sometimes even boasting of how big a &quot;Dijk&quot; she was. She was going 
for humor every time, but soon it got old. Usha smiled every time, 
though: Mira looked so happy, so completely open and free of her choice. 
She was simply gay about being... gay. Usha only wished she could have 
such clarity and contentment; it was one of the many reasons she liked 
Mira.

But she didn&#39;t want to attend her GSA meeting that day.

&quot;To Hell with it,&quot; she muttered to herself as she forced her legs to 
lift, lift, lift her to the soccer field where the beloved Badgers were 
practicing. &quot;I&#39;m just going to go over and say hello and introduce 
myself, and then... I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Ask her on a date?

&quot;Should I really ask her on a date?&quot; she questioned. &quot;Am I even like 
that? A lot of people think so already... Oh, I don&#39;t know, I just don&#39;t 
know.&quot; Krishnan was not used to being confounded, and since the 
experience was so new to her, she had no idea how to handle it. Her legs 
still managed to lift her, until they stopped at the bleachers. She 
raised her eyes and watched the girls run, pass, and kick, and searched 
for Blake. She could always recognize her from everyone else, because 
she was always the one who never got winded or tired. Some people 
might&#39;ve been faster than her, but she could run a marathon like it was 
a jog next door. She was devoted&#151;Usha admired that devotion deeply. And 
besides, Blake was cute.

Did I really think that?

&quot;Cute?&quot; she whispered to herself. She watched Blake and Ivory 
double-team on another girl, overtaking her with speed and quick 
movement. Jocelyn took their pass and delivered flawlessly; the opposite 
goalie never had a chance. Parkin could&#39;ve caught it; even Zane could&#39;ve 
caught it. Leena blew a whistle, and rotated her team slightly. Now 
Blake was goalie, and the poor girl was on defense. Usha smiled sadly, 
knowing how things would turn out. Blake&#39;s ADD (which Krishnan was 
unaware of) made her terrible as a goalie; she needed to focus and pay 
precise attention. Needless to say, the score tipped against her.

&quot;Focus, focus!&quot; she could hear Leena shout. &quot;Blake, pay attention! 
Alisha, Erica, roundabout and head off Ivory when she gets to you. Katt, 
keep on X!&quot; The girls all nodded and did their best to perform each job. 
Usha smiled, content to watch until practice was over. She had more 
homework than she knew what to do with, and her campaign was flopping 
like a trout on dry land&#151;but she reasoned that after a year of being 
silent, she could make little sacrifices to finally reach closure. Once 
the game stopped and the girls were sent home, she had to fight to keep 
herself from cowering away. It would&#39;ve all been for nothing to lose her 
nerve now.

The words &quot;Umm, hello,&quot; came harder to her than anything she had ever 
said, but twice the relief once they were out. Blake smiled awkwardly.

&quot;Oh, you watching the game? I didn&#39;t know we had a fan. You&#39;re Usha, 
right?&quot; Usha nodded her head, showing amazing restraint despite the 
roaring smile in her heart. Blake knew her name! ...Well, of course she 
did, she had been sophomore and freshman class president. She was 
practically a celebrity. Duh.

&quot;Yes, I am&#151;and you&#39;re Blake Baum, the MVP.&quot;

&quot;Former MVP,&quot; replied Baum humbly. She stepped to the side so her fellow 
players could pass, while she faced Usha and leaned against the 
bleachers. &quot;Yeah, this year it&#39;ll go to somebody else. I only won last 
year because Zane broke her arm.&quot;

&quot;Well, I believe it was well-deserved,&quot; said Usha. The praise didn&#39;t 
sound sickening, although Blake became flustered. She just made a sound 
and waved her away. &quot;Anyway...&quot; resumed Krishnan, &quot;you were right about 
having a fan: I&#39;ve been watching your games ever since you came to this 
school, and I must say that I&#39;ve liked them all. I was so happy you won 
the championship, I forgot to do my homework!&quot; (This was something 
monumental to Usha; to Blake, it was like saying she forgot a pencil)

&quot;Oh? So you&#39;re a fan? Y...ou want my autograph?&quot; Usha smiled so 
brilliantly that she didn&#39;t even need to reply. She hadn&#39;t expected 
Blake to ask, but... &quot;Well, okay. Um, how do you spell your name?&quot; Usha 
spelled it out, including her family name, and watched as Blake signed a 
soccer ball. She twirled it in the air briefly before handing it over. 
It read:
To my #1 fan, Usha Krishnan

Good luck in the election
Your pal, Blake F. Baum

&quot;That&#39;s so sweet, albeit unexpected,&quot; whispered Usha quietly. Blake gave 
a humble grin.

&quot;You&#39;re my first fan, and that was my first autograph. When I become a 
famous Olympic athlete, that ball might be worth something.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you want to get into the Olympics?&quot; Now they were getting 
somewhere&#151;and Usha had been scared!

&quot;If I can. I mean, it&#39;s what I can do best. Either soccer or track, 
doesn&#39;t matter to me. I don&#39;t think I need to ask about you.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Usha kept her smile; it had long ago stopped being polite and 
started being genuinely happy. Blake was average, but a sweet and earthy 
average, just like Mira. She wasn&#39;t stuck-up, spoiled, or seemingly 
superior; she was honest and humble, and seemed well at peace with 
herself.

&quot;Could you...&quot; began Krishnan carefully, keeping her eyes on Blake&#39;s 
forehead, &quot;quite possibly... afford the time to... well, converge and 
converse in acquaintanceship with me?&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Uh, you wanna be friends, right?&quot; Usha nodded. &quot;Well, I guess, 
though I don&#39;t know why the class president would wanna hang around me. 
I&#39;m a scrambly-minded bookworm who&#39;s lazy, sloppy, antisocial, and 
tomboyish. And I&#39;ve got ADD, so don&#39;t expect me to pay you too much 
attention.&quot;

&quot;I get enough as it is,&quot; replied Usha wittily. Half of Blake&#39;s mouth 
grinned.

&quot;Oh, well, and I guess you can help me with my homework as well.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not the first self-proclaimed procrastinator I&#39;ve met; I&#39;ve seen 
how well people can work when they really wish it.&quot;

&quot;Not me.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t give yourself enough credit&#151;and for the record, I&#39;m not 
president yet. Do you know my opponent, Mira van Dijk?&quot;

Blake stared at Usha, not quite knowing how to answer.

She was Mira&#39;s frickin&#39; girlfriend.

&quot;A bit,&quot; she managed. She emphasized more truthfully with, &quot;I have a few 
classes with her, and I&#39;ve got science class with the both of you.&quot; Usha 
nodded her head. Well, now she felt silly.

&quot;That&#39;s right. Anyway, you should then know that she calls herself 
exactly what you have called yourself, yet here she is, making me work 
extra hard. I&#39;ve not faced someone like that since...&quot; Usha paused, then 
stopped talking. She apologized for yammering, but Blake had tuned her 
out. Then they both giggled.

&quot;It seems we could be good friends, if I no longer had any doubts,&quot; said 
Baum, sounding embarrassed.

&quot;Doubts? About what?&quot; She grinned sheepishly.

&quot;I still don&#39;t know why you wanna be my friend.&quot;

A pause. Feeling she had gone far, yet still not far enough, Usha went 
for broke and opened herself up.

&quot;To be honest, I want to go on a date with you, Blake&#151;and be your 
girlfriend.&quot;

That caused a reaction.

&quot;Whuh?&quot;

&quot;Ah... too direct? Or... um... I mean... I had hoped you were like that, 
but if you are not, please forgive my idiocy.&quot;

&quot;Um...&quot; Blake was still floored from the sudden declaration&#151;the second, 
she noted. How odd. Nearly six years after she realized she was 
attracted to other girls, when she felt as if all hope of her ever 
finding a girlfriend had been lost for good, what happens? Two women&#151;two 
very beautiful, very special women&#151;had pursued her, coming right out of 
the blue and asking for her hand. It was 
staggering&#151;unbelievable&#151;shocking&#151;implausible!

The others would just die.

&quot;It&#39;s... not like I&#39;m not flattered&#151;I am!&quot; she managed. &quot;But I&#39;m 
terribly confused. And you know why.&quot;

&quot;Ye... no.&quot; A very long pause passed, long enough to make both girls 
shift the weight on their feet twice. Blake frowned.

&quot;Listen, I&#39;m not offended,&quot; she offered, and with a blush, added, &quot;Nor 
am I disgusted. I am attracted to women&#151;I just... well... I guess some 
people just don&#39;t put themselves out very well. You could say I&#39;m 
insecure and shy.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not proud?&quot;

&quot;Are you?&quot; Blake had her there. Usha sighed and made no comment. Blake 
fidgeted with her hands.

&quot;Listen, I...&quot;

What about Mira? You two are already a couple. What, you want to have 
two girlfriends? You hussy. You player. You... wish. It&#39;ll never work 
out. Mira and Usha are rivals. It&#39;d be too silly. Boy, it&#39;d be a good 
story, though!

&quot;I... would honestly... love to accept,&quot; she admitted. Usha braced 
herself for the worst.

&quot;But?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no buts. I&#39;d love to accept, that&#39;s all.&quot; Usha visibly loosened 
with relief. To her amazement, Blake did as well. What, relieved? For 
saying you&#39;ll go out with another girl&#151;that you&#39;ll go out with Usha? 
What&#39;s the matter with you? Look, having two crushes is one thing, but 
two girlfriends... that&#39;s unheard of! And you know they&#39;re going to meet 
each other, with you along for the ride, so how&#39;s that gonna turn out? 
Ugly, right? Right?

&quot;When should I pick you up, and where?&quot; Blake told her. That is, as long 
as her parents allowed her. Her daddy was perfectly open to her sexual 
preference and subsequent girlfriend, but her mother... Ah, Jewish 
mothers. Mothers in general. Blake loved her, but... she was such a 
bitch sometimes.

&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; said Usha, her voice dreamy. She took Blake&#39;s 
hand, and together the two young women felt each other.

&quot;I... definitely feel the same way,&quot; was all the other could say. She 
could be so clumsy with words sometimes. She envied Olivia; that girl 
had a silver tongue. Victoria, too: her thoughtful silence lent her good 
wisdom. At least she wasn&#39;t as course and curt as Gabrielle, though.

And Mira. Don&#39;t forget Mira. I believed you thought the world of her. 
What happened? You gonna break up with her? No? Don&#39;t be so greedy. You 
can&#39;t have both. Only one. You&#39;ve got to pick, and soon. You want the 
fan or the friend? The Dutch or the Indian? The fun or the intelligent? 
Huh?

&quot;Simple,&quot; she told herself as she waited for Usha to pick her up, three 
hours later: &quot;I want both.&quot;

After tonight, you think they&#39;ll both want you? Wishful thinking.

That night, the two girls went on their first date together, mere hours 
before the next big game. They only cared about each other, not the 
silly differences that rested between them. Underneath that gray-black 
sky, with a warm wind and a gentle moon above, they shared their very 
first kiss of intimacy together. It was their first with each other, but 
only Usha there had her first kiss ever with another girl.

The following week, Blake, Mira, and Usha were to meet at a semi-fancy 
restaurant. Each girl had a &quot;friend&quot; they wanted to introduce to the 
other, and while they all remained unaware of what was coming, doubtless 
the date would be a memorable one. Whether it would be an enjoyable one, 
though... that was something else.</pre>
