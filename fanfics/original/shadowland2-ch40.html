<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch39.html">Back to Part 39</a><pre>&quot;Kim?&quot; Jessica helped the girl to her feet, &quot;You alright?&quot; 

Kim looked up to see Jessica standing over her, back to her original 
age, &quot;Jessica?&quot;  She blinked in confusion then glanced around to see 
they were standing in the middle of long hall covered in many strangely 
shaped mirrors. 

&quot;How did you get here?&quot; Jessica inquired curiously, &quot;Where ever here 
is..?&quot; She scanned the many mirrors and glanced down at the river of fog 
at their feet.

Kim got to her feet and brushed off her dress, &quot;The Hall of Mirrors.&quot; 
She explained in displeasure. 

Jessica glanced upon one of the mirrors to see herself laying in bed 
kissing another girl, &quot;Stephanie?&quot; She softly murmured and tilted her 
head at the reflection before her. She moved to the next mirror to see 
her on the couch with Kris and spun around to place her back to the 
mirror. Every mirror was like a window into her mind. All her memories 
and dreams were laid out on the walls before her, throwing her sexual 
nature in her face. She began to tremble at the sight of her sleeping 
with so many girl, &quot;W...what is going on here?&quot; She stammered as she 
backed down the hall.

Kim glanced into one of the mirrors and blushed, &quot;Ummm... Uhhhh...&quot; She 
was stunned by what she was seeing, before her was an image of herself 
curled up with Jenn, Jenn was running her hand along Kim&#39;s leg and along 
her panty line. She swallowed and glanced around to see more of herself 
from her dreams and memories, all sexual, ones of her and Jenn when they 
were young along with other images of her and her father. Images she 
would rather tear from her mind then face again, &quot;T... this... is not 
me...&quot; She protested starring at the image of her father crawling over 
her tiny body, &quot;It is Kima. Not me!!&quot; She cried and pounded at the 
mirrors, &quot;This is not me.&quot; 

Jessica grabbed the girl by the shoulders, &quot;Kimberly!!&quot; She struggled 
against the girl&#39;s flailing arms, &quot;Kim, calm down!!&quot; She turned the girl 
around and pushed her back up against the wall. 

Tears were streaming down Kim&#39;s face as she violently shook her head, 
&quot;This is not me...&quot; She reiterated, &quot;It isn&#39;t.&quot; She screamed to the 
point that her voice began to give out and she started to cough. 

Jessica wildly scanned the halls in search of what could be disturbing 
the girl, &quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; She pulled the girl into her arms while 
stroking her hair, &quot;Shhhh... It&#39;s alright.&quot; She cooed.

&quot;I am dirty.&quot; Kim sobbed in Jessica&#39;s shoulder, &quot;You can see it can&#39;t 
you?&quot; She inquired peering at another of the mirrors.

Jessica shook her head slowly; &quot;I can only see myself in those mirrors.&quot; 
Jessica stated closing her eyes against the images, &quot;You don&#39;t need to 
worry.&quot; She assured, &quot;They are all lies.&quot; She remarked, &quot;Showing us 
images of the part of us we fear the most.&quot;


Kim lifted her head to peer over Jessica&#39;s shoulder at another mirror. 
This one showed her first kiss with Jenn, a moment she wished that she 
had never forgotten, &quot;Jenn...&quot; She slipped out of Jessica&#39;s arms and 
approached the mirror. 

Jessica watched as Kim moved through the river of fog towards a mirror 
that showed herself kissing Kris in their bedroom. She wondered if each 
mirror was linked to a feeling. Maybe what Kim was seeing was related in 
some way to what she felt. If that was the case then the image that Kim 
must be seeing was a very special moment. &quot;You really care for her, 
don&#39;t you?&quot; She inquired softly. 

Kim set her head against the mirror&#39;s cold surface, &quot;Yeah.&quot; She admitted 
with a trembling sigh, &quot;But she doesn&#39;t love me.&quot; She remarked sadly. 
Her eyes drifted to an image of her arguing with Kima, Jenn sitting upon 
the bed next to herself. &#39;I&#39;m not disgusting like you!&#39; She recalled 
those harsh words she had said in Jenn&#39;s presence and realized why Jenn 
seemed so upset. She punched at the wall, &quot;Why do I always messing 
things up.&quot; She stated angrily, &quot;No wonder she doesn&#39;t want to be around 
me. Kima is the one who knows how to react around girls. She was the one 
who kissed Jenn, not me.&quot; She regretfully admitted, &quot;I was always to 
afraid.&quot; 

Jessica placed her arms around the girl, &quot;There&#39;s more to love then 
kissing someone, you know?&quot;

Kim glanced up at Jessica, &quot;There is?&quot; She inquired interested to learn 
more, &quot;You&#39;ve kissed a lot of girls, haven&#39;t you?&quot; She bluntly inquired. 

Jessica was taken abash by Kim&#39;s question, &quot;Well...&quot; She skimmed the 
many mirrors, &quot;Yeah...&quot; She embarrassedly confessed, &quot;More then I care 
to admit too.&quot; She let out a deep sigh, &quot;But I&#39;ve only cared for two 
girls.&quot; She looked up and down the halls again, &quot;And I don&#39;t think I 
would willing go through something like this for her. It was your choice 
to be here, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; 

Kim nodded, &quot;I got lost here before.&quot; She explained with a weak chuckle, 
&quot;Kima helped me find Jenn back then. I would have been lost here forever 
if it wasn&#39;t for her.&quot; 

&quot;Then how do we get out of here?&quot; Jessica eagerly asked.

Kim gave a fidgety smile, &quot;Turn around.&quot; She shyly requested. 

Reluctantly Jessica did as she was told

Kim closed her eyes, &quot;Jenn... where ever you are? Come back to me.&quot; She 
called out. When she opened her eyes she again found a door before her 
just like the last time she was lost amongst these mirrors, however 
something was different, &quot;This can&#39;t be right,&quot; She stated blinking at 
the set of red steel double door before her, &quot;These aren&#39;t the same 
doors as before.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jessica turned around to see the large doors. There was 
a set of words painted above the doors, &quot;East Wing Library?&quot; She read, 
&quot;What would she be doing in there?&quot; She inquired curiously.

Kim shrugged, &quot;At least it isn&#39;t that nightmarish hall from before...&quot; 
She shuddered at the memory of the last time she was in Jenn&#39;s mind and 
prepared to open the doors then hesitated, &quot;At least I hope it isn&#39;t...&quot;
