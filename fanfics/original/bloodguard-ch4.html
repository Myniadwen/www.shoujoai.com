<h1>Bloody Guardian (part 4 of 7)</h1>

<a href="../original/bloodguard-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The black haired woman gracefully made her way through
the crowds, her long hair flowing around her. Her gown
swirled around her legs, her eyes sweeping the people
searchingly, looking for something undefined.

&quot;Hello, m&#39;lady,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice was like honey as
they stood by the torches, the fire light flickering
over them.

&quot;Princess,&quot; Heather turned to look at her, bowing her
head slightly in respect to the noble, but there was
no submission in her eyes.

The Princess simply smiled back, her own red hair
shining in the dim light. &quot;You are the talk of the
court,&quot; she pointed out in a husky purr, &quot;I think your
actions will keep all our gossips busy for the next
few months.&quot;

&quot;My apologies,&quot; Heather said to her wryly, &quot;I was
unaware that the two noblewomen I visited had lacked
discretion.&quot;

&quot;I almost expected you to deny the rumors,&quot; the
Princess looked amused.

Heather shook her head. &quot;Denying such things merely
fuels the gossips,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;d rather pull their
teeth with the truth.&quot;

&quot;Impressive,&quot; the Princess acknowledged. She reached
out to rest a hand on Heather&#39;s arm, &quot;I was
wondering... if I could confirm the stories are true?&quot;

Heather gave her a searching look as she asked
warningly, &quot;Are you sure you wish to be the subject of
the gossips?&quot;

&quot;I do not fear rumors,&quot; the Princess laughed.

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Heather reached out to stroke her cheek
once, then moved off into the near darkness of the
hall. Out of the corner of her eye Heather saw the
woman who was her true target, and with unerring
accuracy she moved in.

The serving girl finished collecting the pieces of a
broken mug then the brown haired girl looked up,
seemingly sensing the other woman&#39;s arrival. &quot;M&#39;lord,&quot;
she squeaked out, her dark eyes wide with surprise.

&quot;Carrie,&quot; Heather nodded, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time.&quot; She
wasn&#39;t offended that Carrie didn&#39;t recognize her, her
formal manner and fine clothes were extremely
different than how she had looked visiting the girl&#39;s
family.

&quot;Aunt Heather?&quot; Carrie blurted, looking up at her in
shock.

Nor was Heather actually the girl&#39;s aunt, but all of
the children in the family had come to call her that
over time. &quot;Your mother is worried about you,&quot; Heather
said to Carrie softly, &quot;she asked me to go look for
you.&quot;

Carrie started to head towards the kitchen with the
broken mug in hand, Heather following closely like a
stalking cat. &quot;How did you find me?&quot; Carrie asked her
after they found a quiet corner in the busy room.

&quot;There weren&#39;t many places I thought you could go,&quot;
Heather said dryly. &quot;This was one of a few noble keeps
near the village that needed servant girls.&quot;

&quot;I guess I wasn&#39;t as clever as I thought I was,&quot;
Carrie admitted, the shapely younger woman tugging
nervously at the rough wool of her servant&#39;s dress.

&quot;In truth I wouldn&#39;t have expected you to make it
here,&quot; Heather conceded. She fixed Carrie with a
intense look, &quot;Why did you run away?&quot;

&quot;Mother is working so hard taking care of us,&quot; Carrie
said softly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to add anything more to her
burden.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not a burden for her,&quot; Heather pointed out to
her gently.

&quot;Either way,&quot; Carrie met her eyes with determination,
&quot;I want to help her.&quot;

Heather studied Carrie, weighing her words and the
strength of her will. &quot;I can&#39;t make you go home,&quot;
Heather finally conceded, &quot;but... be careful, little
one. This court is a dangerous place, even for someone
who is just a servant.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be careful, Auntie,&quot; Carrie flashed a smile.

&quot;An&#39; don&#39;t be calling me that, either,&quot; Heather
chuckled warmly, &quot;I&#39;ll ne&#39;er hear the end of it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Carrie promised.

&quot;Do that,&quot; and with an eerie degree of silence Heather
was gone.

Heather firmly shook away the memories of the past,
meeting the bartender&#39;s eyes directly as she asked,
&quot;What do you mean, missing children?&quot;

Carter nodded grimly, his short brown hair streaked
with gray as he wiped the top of the bar off. &quot;There&#39;s
been a few street kids who used to haunt this place,
but they&#39;ve all dropped out of sight,&quot; he said
gruffly.

&quot;And you used to give them food and stuff, like little
lost kittens,&quot; Heather said, her voice gently teasing.
Not mocking, of course, for she knew she had similar
tendencies to take in lost lambs. &#39;Like Alice,&#39; she
thought of the girl guiltily.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Carter agreed with a sigh. He
poured himself a beer and her a wine, the setting sun
shining in through the window as he asked, &quot;Do you
think you could do me a favor and take a look into
it?&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Heather asked as she took a drink.

&quot;When you talk to people they listen,&quot; Carter
shrugged, &quot;and answer your questions even if they
really don&#39;t want to.&quot;

&quot;I can be very persuasive,&quot; Heather said just a bit
dangerously, a silent but clear warning.

Carter picked up on it, too. &quot;Not asking any
questions,&quot; he added quickly, &quot;I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s
things about you I don&#39;t want to know.&quot; He took
another drink, staring down into his mug as he added
quietly, &quot;Please?&quot;

Heather finished off her glass of wine and sighed
softly. &quot;No promises,&quot; she said and quietly left the
bar even as the evening crowd began arriving.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Carter murmured before going to work.

Heather began in the shelters, moving from church to
community center and asking questions about missing
kids or adults. A few tried to deny her, but a long
look into her piercing eyes and a touch of her will
made them wilt. Like pieces of a puzzle she gathered
information, and the picture it formed was very
disturbing.

There were the usual transients who moved from city to
city, but many of the young people who had been
haunting the streets for the last few months had been
gradually disappearing. More worrying was that the
disappearances were scattered all over the city, not
in any one territory or area. The only connecting
theme seemed to be that friends reported the kids
claimed they had found a big break of some kind.

After questioning a few people pointedly Heather got a
name, and eventually reached a small office building
in a bad part of town. A sign reading Lockheed studios
was hanging nearby the front door and Heather paused,
tilting her head to the side to better catch the smell
of the evening&#39;s breeze. There was the thick smell of
bleach and disinfectant on the air, but just beneath
that the powerful taint of blood. It was faint, only
her own unique senses could have spotted it, but it
lead inside the older office building.

A locked main door yielded to Heather&#39;s superior
strength and she strode inside, her gaze sweeping the
oddly clean front hall. She stalked forward past
mailboxes towards the stairs, trailing a finger past
squeaky clean walls. &#39;Did someone struggle down here?&#39;
she thought bleakly.

&quot;Help...&quot; a choked off cry came from upstairs.

Swiftly Heather raced up the stairs, her coat
fluttering around her, and she followed the cries and
a scent of blood to a room in a corner of the upper
floor. A single shove sent the door crashing inward
and two figures gazed at her in surprise. A younger
lady struggled weakly, striking her captor softly,
while the man narrowed his eyes... fangs gleaming.

&#39;One of our kind?&#39; Heather realized, swiftly assessing
him.

He looked oddly mild, short brown hair falling in a
messy mop and his eyes gleamed a faint red, his face
twisted by hunger and rage into something inhuman as
he clutched the girl possessively. &quot;What do you want?&quot;
he demanded.

&#39;A pup,&#39; Heather felt herself smiling as her own fangs
gleamed, &#39;and a young one, too, if he can&#39;t sense what
I am.&#39;

Once he saw her revealed fangs his eyes widened, then
the young man stiffened slightly as he tried to summon
courage. &quot;My name is Daniels, Sebastian...&quot; he
stammered a bit then recovered, &quot;he sent me here, told
me there were no others of our kind here.&quot;

&quot;Ah, dear Sebastian,&quot; Heather smiled coldly, &quot;He and I
don&#39;t get along, so I suspect he sent you here to vex
me.&quot; Her conversational tone dropped away like a mask
as she said grimly, &quot;This is my territory, pup. I am
the only one who hunts here.&quot;

&quot;I could challenge you...&quot; Daniels managed.

&quot;I&#39;d tear you apart,&quot; Heather countered, &quot;literally.
The only reason I&#39;m not doing it right now is that
Sebastian would probably like that.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me...&quot; the girl in the boy&#39;s grip started to
say.

&quot;Sleep,&quot; Heather barked the word and she was out in a
instant, the power of Heather&#39;s will overwhelming her.

&quot;So strong,&quot; Daniels paled again. Hurriedly laying the
girl down he said, &quot;I&#39;ll leave, miss, right now.
You&#39;ll never see me again.&quot;

&quot;You do that. And Daniels?&quot; Heather asked as he raced
to the door.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Daniels asked as he looked back over his
shoulder, his ill fitting suit making him look even
more foolish.

&quot;I will kill you if I see you here again.&quot;

After Daniels fled Heather walked to the sleeping
girl, kneeling down to pick her up gently. Once the
child was awake she&#39;d bite her, then use her gifts to
wipe this whole experience from her mind. Cleaning up
the mess Daniels felt would take more work but Heather
could manage. This building probably hid the young
vampire&#39;s other victims, too... she&#39;s have to come up
with a excuse to get the police out here, soon.

&quot;It&#39;s been a long night and my work is just
beginning,&quot; Heather smiled to herself wryly.</pre>
