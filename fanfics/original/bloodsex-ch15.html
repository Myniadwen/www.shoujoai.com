--------------------------------------------------

Jess Drake looked at the clock, the numbers counting
up towards midnight, and wished that she could get
some sleep. She got up out of bed and padded over to
the kitchen, opening up her fridge thoughtfully as a
bit of black hair fell into her eyes. The leftovers
looked decidedly unappetizing, while the bottle of
whisky looked remarkably tempting. Refusing to give in
she shut the door, walking over to the living room and
collapsing into a chair.

&#39;Besides, a drink won&#39;t solve my problems,&#39; the panty
and bra clad woman thought grimly, only a bit of
moonlight coloring the room.

The day had barely begun when trouble dropped right on
her doorstep, a human, mad priest and a demoness, all
needing her help. Sam, the knight templair, should
have known better, even if Alex and their inhuman
friend didn&#39;t. If word got back to the Lady Diana that
she had treated the demoness Jess would probably come
under attack, if not be pulled into their private
little war.

Jess wanted to turn them aside, but someone had really
done a number on the demoness, riddling her with metal
fragments, holy water and sacred oils. It was clear to
Jess that she&#39;d die in hours unless something was
done, and she couldn&#39;t ignore that.

&quot;And I do owe Sam,&quot; Jess conceded softly to herself.

Hustling all of them into her back room Jess was about
to get to work when the bell out in the shop rang,
signaling that someone else had come inside. Fighting
back a flash of irritation Jess hurried out to see who
it was only to see her friend Alice Sinclare smiling
with a wry amusement as she watched her emerge from
the back room.

&quot;You forgot about lunch?&quot; Alice said, the black haired
business woman looking oddly ill as she took in the
blood splattered on Jess clothes.

Jess winced, realizing it was today. &quot;An emergency job
has come up,&quot; she said curtly, &quot;I guess we&#39;ll have to
do this another time.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Alice said gracefully when a harsh voice
interrupted them.

&quot;Get back here, Drake! We don&#39;t have much time,&quot; Sam
called out irritably.

Alice frowned, &quot;Impatient, isn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;I sometimes get people who need help urgently,&quot; Jess
found herself saying coldly, &quot;though I guess someone
from the sort of world you come from wouldn&#39;t
understand that.&quot; Almost as soon as she said it Jess
wanted to choke it back, but it was too late.

Alice stiffened, her brown eyes narrowing in anger.
&quot;Maybe I should just let you get to work,&quot; she said,
leaving with a quiet sort of dignity.

&quot;Crap,&quot; Jess sighed, knowing there was no time to go
after her.

&#39;No, I don&#39;t know if I could have handled that much
worse,&#39; Jess thought, sitting in the darkness as she
thought about what happened that day.

Patching up the demoness had taken nearly two hours,
with all the magic that had been needed to cleanse the
poisons that had seeped into her form. Once Jess was
done she nearly collapsed, the three women leaving
quietly after offering thanks that she didn&#39;t even
want.

Once she recovered from her efforts and changed out of
her blood splattered clothes Jess hurried over to
Sisterhood books, hoping that Alice was still working
today but her luck was running true to form. She was
long gone. Her assistant Hunter, on the other hand,
was there and looked remarkably annoyed, in fact.

&quot;What the hell did you do to Alice?&quot; Hunter demanded,
the lanky blonde woman advancing on Jess in anger.
&quot;She left here all happy and came back nearly in
tears,&quot; she continued.

Jess closed her eyes, sighing painfully. &quot;I shot off
my stupid mouth,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;and had to cancel
our lunch date.&quot;

&quot;Something occult came up?&quot; Hunter asked perceptively.

&quot;A friend needed a favor,&quot; Jess said as she sat down
in one of the corners, a comfy chair set there for
reading. &quot;It was a real emergency, and I was already
pissed at their dumping it on me when Alice arrived,&quot;
she explained.

&quot;And you said something really cranky to the first
person who came by,&quot; Hunter nodded wisely. She shook
her head as she said, &quot;Normally I&#39;d suggest calling
Alice up, but I think you&#39;ll need to give Alice some
time to calm down first.&quot;

&quot;That bad?&quot; Jess asked.

&quot;Alice got over the crying and had worked herself up
into a nice rage by the time she left,&quot; Hunter
confirmed.

Jess put her face in her hands and groaned.

Hunter leaned up against the wall, looking down at
Jess thoughtfully. &quot;So what&#39;s this I hear about you
and Elizabeth?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Jess looked confused at the change of subject,
&quot;She&#39;s coming in to get some additional work done, and
occasionally we play together.&quot;

&quot;And what does Alice think of this?&quot; Hunter raised her
eyebrows.

&quot;Alice and I don&#39;t have that kind of relationship,&quot;
Jess answered.

&quot;That&#39;s not what Alice thinks,&quot; Hunter said firmly.
She paused, &quot;Or maybe it&#39;s better to say that she
believes you two are going in that direction.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Jess paused, trying to shape her unruly
thoughts into words. &quot;Maybe we are,&quot; she finally said,
&quot;I don&#39;t know. Alice is so different from anybody I&#39;ve
dated, I just don&#39;t understand where she&#39;s coming from
at times.&quot;

Hunter looked amused, &quot;She says much the same things
about you, too.&quot; At Jess&#39; surprised look she
continued, &quot;What, you don&#39;t think Alice has talked to
me about you two?&quot;

&quot;And you aren&#39;t going to tell me any of it,&quot; Jess
didn&#39;t even make it a question.

&quot;Course not,&quot; Hunter nodded, &quot;you&#39;re both my friends,
remember?&quot;

Jess heaved herself to her feet, swaying tiredly. &quot;I&#39;d
better go close up the shop for the day,&quot; she sighed,
&quot;I hate to do it, but I&#39;m in no shape to work right
now.&quot;

&quot;I hate to dump something else on you....&quot; Hunter
started.

&quot;But you&#39;re going to anyway,&quot; Jess sighed.

&quot;Circe wanted me to ask you to stop by the Daughters
of Artemis,&quot; Hunter said gently, &quot;she wants you to
help her circle of mystics to upgrade the place&#39;s
defenses.&quot;

&quot;Again?&quot; Jess looked at Hunter disbelievingly. Shaking
her head she muttered, &quot;What is she expecting to hit
the bar, the wrath of god?&quot;

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Hunter shrugged gracefully, the firm mounds
of her breasts moving under she shirt.

Jess felt a flash of interest and forced it down.
&quot;Your mojo is going again,&quot; she reminded Hunter. Jess
strode to the door to get away from the succubus as
she continued, &quot;All right, I&#39;ll go visit the Daughters
after I go home and rest up.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Hunter called cheerfully as Jess left,
her voice already taking on a sexy lilt.

Sitting in the dark Jess leaned forward, putting her
head in her hands. &#39;I guess that was my second big
mistake,&#39; she mused, &#39;agreeing to go to the bar.&#39;

Helping Circe and the others perform the rituals
hadn&#39;t taken so long, and afterward the witch had
offered a round of drinks to everyone there. Having
nothing better to do that night Jess agreed,
eventually working her way through three rounds.

&quot;Hello, lover,&quot; Elizabeth purred, the slim blonde
snuggling up to Jess&#39; back.

Jess shrugged her off, &quot;Watch the hands.&quot; She turned
slightly to look at her, again struck by how lovely
and yet how shallow the woman seemed. &quot;Don&#39;t you have
someone else to bother tonight?&quot; she asked her wryly.

&quot;No one as exiting as you,&quot; Elizabeth smirked. With a
laugh she perched on Jess lap, wrapping her arms
around the taller woman to snuggle close.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to do this today,&quot; Jess reflexedly
steadied the girl with her hand as she continued,
&quot;I&#39;ve had a real shitty day today and I&#39;m not in the
mood.&quot;

&quot;But Jess.....&quot; Elizabeth started to say then trailed
off as she looked over Jess&#39; shoulder and murmured,
&quot;uh oh.&quot;

Jess turned slightly only to freeze. Alice stood
there, looking at the two of them with a face made
pale by shock and other emotions. Hunter stood behind
her with an apologetic look and Jess instantly
realized that she had brought Alice here, probably to
give them a chance to make up.

&quot;You... you...&quot; Alice shook a moment then stepped
forward as Elizabeth scampered away and slapped Jess
across the face, then turned and fled.

&quot;Shit,&quot; Jess cursed softly as she tried to get up, the
beer that she had drank making her too wobbly to
pursue Alice. Hunter reached out to steady her and
Jess was surprised to see a tear in the other woman&#39;s
eyes.

&quot;I never meant....&quot; Hunter said weakly.

Back in her apartment Jess Drake let the tears flow at
last, sitting there in the darkness and crying softly.
Hunter had helped her get home, apologizing all the
way even as Jess tried to tell her it wasn&#39;t her
fault. If anyone was to blame it was Jess, for being
stupid enough to think the rules didn&#39;t apply to her.

&quot;So,&quot; Jess sobbed to herself, &quot;what do I do now?&quot;
