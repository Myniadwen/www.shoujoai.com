It was no mystery that Christine Velshoni&#151;going by the appropriate alias 
Envy&#151;hated everyone in her group, even her Master&#151;well, especially her 
Master. After all, he had much more power than she did, and could give 
and take as he saw fit. There was nothing he could not have: for 
pleasure, Lust; for amusement, Pride (he loved tormenting the 
egotistical brat); for indulgence, Avarice and Gluttony; for bloodlust, 
Wrath; for peace, Sloth; for the mere want of want, she herself. Envy 
despised that kind of power, but could do nothing against it, except 
kowtow and be silent.

Lust and Pride she abhorred, for their beauty and perfection, whereas 
she was plain at best. She was constantly mocked by the two, whether 
purposely or no, but knew that, even as Envy, she could never measure 
up. Avarice she hated for his wealth&#151;she had always been a poor girl&#151;and 
Gluttony for his appetite, because she knew hunger well. Sloth she 
loathed, because he literally didn&#39;t have to work for anything, while 
she had been a slave all her life; and Wrath was contemptible because of 
his strength, his rage, his sweet vengeance. Envy had been walked on all 
her life; she had seen too few flashes of such retribution.

Christine distanced herself from everyone and worked mostly by 
herself&#151;solitude gave her nobody to compare herself against. In truth, 
her Master provided everything she could ask for, mostly things that the 
others possessed and took for granted, but for Christine, it was never 
enough, ever. Much like Avarice and Gluttony&#151;and in a way, all of &quot;The 
Seven&quot;&#151;she was cursed with Want, and ached and ached for everything even 
if she got it. But this weakness was in truth her ultimate strength, and 
thus had made her ideal for the roster. Her Master loved her desire and 
brought it to its bubbling potential. Of course, he expected something 
in return.

&quot;Envy, could you come into my chamber, please? I have something I wish 
to say to everybody.&quot;

&quot;All right.&quot;

......

Holivx Dirge and Hanz Himmler&#151;better known as Wrath and Pride&#151;knelt 
anxiously before their Master, one finding the task considerably easier 
than the other. Pride hated kneeling before anyone, but this was his 
Master, the man in control of his life and his future, the one 
being&#151;aside from nearby Lust, perhaps&#151;who was his equal, if not his 
better. Pride sucked up his best trait and waited patiently for his 
Master to speak. Lust&#39;s cleavage was out and proud as she knelt 
(probably why Master was taking so long); Envy had a look of scorn, as 
always, and poor Gluttony could only nod lowly, he was so fat. Sloth was 
the only one who didn&#39;t kneel, but only because he was in a wheelchair 
and didn&#39;t have to get out. He hung his head, but his head always hung 
down anyway, so really he was just wheeled in by somebody, not needing 
to do anything else save attend.

&quot;Welcome,&quot; said their Master at last. Most of them stood, or those who 
were able and willing (Gluttony gargled as he lifted himself up). Master 
continued: &quot;It&#39;s not normal we all see each other in the same room. I&#39;ve 
been sending all of you everywhere, letting you test your skills and 
your loyalty. I must say, every one of you has proven himself or herself 
perfectly in their own way. Individually, you have done better than most 
small groups of exceptional people, so you can imagine what a group 
effort could do.&quot;

&quot;And what is this group effort?&quot; wondered Avarice, who would soon find 
out.

&quot;It has come to my attention that there are more forces at work in this 
world than I have reckoned. Many more. None of them have the capability 
to overwhelm us, of course, but if they combined their forces, it would 
be disastrous. I&#39;ve been testing and flexing each of you for this one 
eventuality&#151;to strike before we are struck!&quot;

&quot;There are forces all over the world,&quot; muttered Wrath; &quot;how are we to go 
about this?&quot;

&quot;At first, here and there, subtly and secretly. Advanced tests, you 
could call them. In a week or so&#151;seven days, fittingly&#151;I will unveil my 
grand scheme. It&#39;s better to get a toehold before you climb a mountain, 
though, so this is why this first step is necessary. I assume there&#39;s no 
objection?&quot;

There wasn&#39;t.

&quot;Splendid. I&#39;ll be putting most of you with partners, so do try and get 
along. Envy, you&#39;re the exception; I know how you love working by 
yourself.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; she said with a relieved smile.

&quot;You will start by planting your seeds in the nearby city, which is 
casually frequented by so-called superheroes. There&#39;s nothing more 
delightful than a city full of people envious of their own idols, and 
each other.&quot;

&quot;Sounds fun.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you think so. You may leave whenever you wish,&quot; (and with 
that she was instantly away, wanting rather to work than lounge). &quot;The 
rest of you, here are your assignments. Avarice, Sloth, I&#39;m sending you 
as a recon team into the lion&#39;s den. Find out about this place and see 
what you can&#39;t...extract. But be wary; I sense a strong force is 
approaching that area. Use caution.&quot;

&quot;I understand. Where are we to go?&quot;

&quot;The Militaristic Enterprise for the Reformation of Civilization and 
Society.&quot;

&quot;Oh, there.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Would it be a bother?&quot; Avarice chuckled.

&quot;Of course not, no. Walter, are you up to it?&quot; Walter Barsnef, the man 
designated as Sloth, let out a soft groan, perhaps his way of saying 
yes. Avarice shrugged&#151;Walter didn&#39;t have a choice anyway&#151;and the two 
left as soon as they were prepared.

&quot;Wrath, Pride, I know you are going to like what I have in store for 
you. Remember those girls you fought against in that burning town? 
Pride, do you especially recall the matters we discussed after I 
summoned you away from that tournament? Well, here is your chance to get 
back at those girls. They have become a nuisance. I have a feeling you 
might even find some willing accomplices.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d much rather go by myself,&quot; said Pride with a haughty sigh, &quot;but if 
it&#39;s your orders, well...even I can heed them. Just don&#39;t expect a very 
pretty description of the mess we will leave behind.&quot;

&quot;I never do.&quot;

&quot;Lust, Gluttony, this leaves the two of you. I know it seems like an odd 
combination, but bear with me, I&#39;m going somewhere with this. It&#39;s a 
food shipping plant that has recently began using their merchandise to 
secretly spread drugs throughout the streets. They hide everything in 
the food&#151;Frederick, pay attention now, you&#39;ll get your chance&#151;and ship 
it to all the chains. Now this is an action I rather like, but so much 
more could be done with it. This is your field, Gluttony, so you may do 
as you wish. Lust...&quot;

&quot;Seduce and destroy as usual?&quot; she said. Her Master smiled.

&quot;You know me very well. You&#39;re not tiring of it, are you?&quot;

&quot;Why would I?&quot; Master chuckled.

&quot;I hear there are many people in charge. Do you think you can handle 
them all?&quot;

&quot;Who do you think you&#39;re talking to?&quot; she squealed prettily. &quot;I&#39;m the 
girl who once enslaved an entire prison block. I&#39;m the lady who 
indirectly controlled one of the most powerful brothels in the country. 
This will be easier than napping.&quot;

&quot;I knew you could do it. And Gluttony?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; he barked. Master sighed.

&quot;Make sure that food doesn&#39;t have drugs in it before you eat it. I would 
hate for you to become an addict&#151;well, to that stuff, at least.&quot; 
Gluttony laughed and promised he&#39;d do his best, and the two left their 
Master all by himself. Once he was with the silent, empty black air of 
his room, the Master stood up, shed off his dark robe, and stared at his 
own face in the mirror.

&quot;Omega, my friend, you&#39;re as ambitious as the great Morning Star 
himself.&quot;

.........

Edward Nashiyori had only known terror thrice in his successful life. 
The very first two were interlaced with each other, one right after the 
next&#151;it had been when he first met his Master, the only one he bowed to. 
Master frightened him, and that near-death experience he suffered 
directly before meeting Master had scared the wits out of him, but there 
was a different fear this time, as he sat waiting impatiently for an 
audience with Director Taichou. Not one to be fearful, his nervousness 
surprised him, but who could blame him? After all, even his cohort Hanz 
Himmler would be distant from this new menace.

To ease his mind, Nashiyori&#151;Avarice to his companions and Master&#151;thought 
about how he had gotten to where he was presently. Never mind his 
enigmatic Master sending him on a quest to speak with Taichou; Avarice 
thought further back and reflected on history. He had been born, in a 
sense, a vacuum, much like his partner Frederick Revini had, but Edward 
sucked money and power, not food. His mother, a useless and wasted 
person in his eyes, had divorced his father decades ago (he didn&#39;t 
bother keeping track of her after that), leaving him to be a student of 
his father&#39;s greed.

And like a vacuum, he had sucked up every little scrap of wealth, from 
the very small to the very large, and was soon dealing in even filthier 
businesses, such as drug and weapons trafficking, and had even started 
an illegal &quot;Human Exchange Program&quot;, where people&#151;usually those who had 
opposed him and their families&#151;were bought and sold just like anything 
else. Oh, those were good days; he could still recall how bloated he 
felt from those dealings, even though he kept his body in rather good 
shape.

Of course, even the best made mistakes, but hey, that was where his 
Master came in, and two of his three known fears as well. One was far 
behind him; surviving a near-death encounter with a person of 
exceptional skills (Sanaa, was it?) gave him an increased edge, and made 
him feel a little stronger. Even humbly cowering before his Master was 
of no consequence, for why would Master hurt his own disciple, Avarice, 
when he so admirably performed his duties? No, Edward was invincible by 
all means, and could laugh at fear&#151;except now. Things were different 
now.

He was in the presence of Ezekiel the Seeker, and dreaded every moment 
of it.

Luckily, he would not have to be stuck inside that room for long. A 
young woman with pretty, slightly exotic features called him, and guided 
him (and Ezekiel, unfortunately) into an anteroom. There, Avarice was 
called by himself into a further room, where he would be split from the 
crazed old man for quite some time. And when he got out, well...who 
cared if he showed rudeness by walking exceptionally fast? Even great 
and terrible men had fears, and things they did not want to confront. 
Ezekiel&#39;s glare was just the only one, that&#39;s all.

Meanwhile, Sloth waited very patiently by himself, sometimes chuckling 
as his powers oozed throughout the building. The employees of MERCS 
would soon become lazy, weary, and fatigued, and their progress would 
die&#151;along with them if they were unlucky. He had such a marvelous gift, 
and all he had to do was sit there and enjoy the d&eacute;cor. Too bad most of 
the temporary help in the building gave him dirty looks, and rushed off 
before the effects of his numbing abilities took hold of them. Oh well, 
no loss.

......

Ten minutes earlier, Vita-might employees had been crowding around, 
screaming for joy as the nubile young woman offered her &quot;services&quot; to 
them in exchange for little more than smiles and politeness. Now, 
though, every one of them lay dead, piled on the floor as if their 
sexual congress had taken their very lives&#151;which it had. Lust sighed 
emptily as she stood, not yet fully undressed even, and assessed the 
situation. It had been far too easy to tame this group. Far too easy.

&quot;I hope he&#39;s done,&quot; she sighed, thinking of Gluttony. &quot;I&#39;m really bored. 
Maybe if I find a few employees to pass the time with...&quot; She dressed 
herself and left the dead to rot, presuming Frederick would clean up the 
mess in his own fashion. Vita-might was quite a large building, 
encompassing twice the mass of the Seven&#39;s own headquarters, and Lust 
had all of it to herself, or at least the parts Frederick had not called 
for his own. She was more than content to let him be alone, for the 
great fat man disgusted her, and she feared his hungry gaze.

Lust came across a break room by accident, and grimaced as she 
discovered nothing but hoary, wrinkly, crusty old men, most of them 
smelling like they had just smoked a cigar made of pitch tar. They 
hollered for her&#151;what a curse her beauty was&#151;but she knew she could do 
better, and scampered away, looking for other prospects. She found a 
younger and more attractive man wandering around, and forced him into a 
closet before he even knew what happened.

In more ways than one, he was screwed.

Lust was still unsatisfied as she left him dead in the closet. She 
hadn&#39;t even taken anything off and had already won. Perhaps a woman 
would be more of a challenge. She found a very striking, slightly older 
blonde walking about, eyes fixed on a clipboard and hair tightly braided 
in the back. She had glasses and looked far too pretty to be working 
alongside those walrus-like men, and Lust just had to wonder about her. 
She approached the woman, broke into a conversation, and in only a few 
minutes found herself in one of the women&#39;s bathrooms, pleasured briefly 
but thoroughly by the hot blonde.

Unfortunately, said blonde had only just brought her &quot;new lover&quot; to one 
climax before covering her lips with her mouth, and that was her 
mistake. Lust had wanted things to go on (and on), and for awhile 
contemplated not killing this sensual creature. But she still had some 
clothes on&#151;Lust had never totally disrobed at all during her thousands 
of sessions&#151;and being not yet nude, felt dissatisfied. And anybody who 
could not satisfy her deserved the kiss of death.

So, with a sigh of regret, she stepped over the unfortunate lady, and 
went in search of other pursuits.

Gluttony had gotten hold of the manager of Vita-might, and chewed his 
ear off.

Along with the rest of him.

Food distribution managers always did have a unique flavor to them.

......

Much like Sloth and Pride, Envy&#39;s mere presence affected people, and 
true to her alias, it instilled in their hearts a sense of Wanting, of 
need, of desire that could never be fulfilled. Wives and daughters eyed 
husbands and sons. The poor craved, the rich pined, the mundane burned. 
She felt better just by strolling and seeing the look of jealousy in 
people&#39;s faces, even those she merely passed. Small riots broke out, and 
these in turn became huge. Stores were looted, people mugged or beaten, 
buildings torched&#151;all for the want of more, of More.

Envy wanted to cause more chaos, but the day was over quickly&#151;her day 
had ended as soon as it began. Feeling empty as always, she returned to 
the Seven&#39;s base, and waited six long days for the others to come. 
Master Omega praised her outstanding success, but even this did not 
slate her thirst long. She soon became enflamed as he confronted 
everyone else about their jobs: Sloth and Avarice had done so well, Lust 
and Gluttony were such great successes, Pride and Wrath...

Envy allowed a rare smile of satisfaction to curl on her face as Omega 
stared coldly at Pride, at Wrath, and demanded to know why they, even 
teamed with four others, had not succeeded. They shamed him. Envy 
guffawed when she heard the news. Only true suffering, the suffering of 
others, for people to be brought lower than her, made her happy.

&quot;Master,&quot; intoned Wrath shamefully, &quot;we couldn&#39;t do anything. One of 
their number was a priest. He knew how to counter our actions. We were 
helpless before him!&quot;

&quot;A priest?&quot; Omega whispered to himself and, for the first time since 
anyone had known him, seemed to lose his grasp of power. The mere 
mention of a priest, a follower of the hated God, sent many of them into 
shock. Yet Omega recovered, and even wore a smile again.

&quot;You did say that only one of their number was a priest, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;

&quot;Then it is only one. Only one. He&#39;d be overwhelmed by our group...or 
somebody working for us who does not have such...weaknesses.&quot; The Seven 
flinched at the mere mention of weaknesses; Omega grinned cattily. 
&quot;Regardless, you&#39;ve all done well. Wrath, Pride, I can overlook this 
blunder since it was a special case and had conditions I did not factor. 
Up until then, you performed perfectly. Our next goal is the big one.&quot;

&quot;Which is...?&quot; demanded Avarice. Omega stood, which meant everyone else 
knelt or bowed.

&quot;The Seven are to launch an all-out assault against that group of 
specially-talented people known as &#39;The Lost&#39;,&quot; he announced. &quot;And I 
myself shall contest with their founder. He and I have an old...score to 
settle.&quot;

----------

To be continued...

Things seem to be growing worse as the darkness spreads. Will the Seven 
emerge victorious over the Lost? What will happen in the battle between 
Omega and Mr. White? Who will survive, if anyone? For the moment, the 
focus turns elsewhere, to the MERCS organization, where its mysterious 
Director has just been granted his deepest wishes, and where a terrible 
power awaits. Many questions will remain unanswered in the next chapter, 
&quot;Taichou&quot;. Stay tuned!</pre>
