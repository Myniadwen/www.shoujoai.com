<p>“The Marriage of Naja Elapidae: brute of a  bride!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Naja Elapidae was sound asleep in her room when she was  thrown out of her bed onto the cold, merciless floor, without the  slightest bit of warning to alert her. After rubbing her sore nose  and grumbling incoherently, she climbed to her feet— and was tossed  again as the ship bucked and rolled. Because nothing moves for no  reason, Naja went through the catalogue of what could possibly be  causing this ship of fools to jerk around like that— anything from  pilot drunkenness to alien attack; the floor was wide open for  possibility. Of course, these sorts of things are usually caused by  the last thing people expect, and this time it was no exception.</p>
<p>“What the hell is going on?!” she screeched,  tumbling into the main hallway. Everyone else was awake and fastened  into their restraints, except for Rachel, who was floating dizzily in  the air.</p>
<p>“There she is!” Fuuka screamed. “It’s  completely your fault we’re under attack like this, Naja! That ship  is saying it’s from <em>your</em> home world!”</p>
<p>“What ship?! What’s going on?! Damn it, somebody <em>tell</em> me!”</p>
<p>“A convoy from the Elshyrin world Jelrin discovered  our location and has begun firing sonic disruptors,” Herut  announced flatly. “In a matter of moments, we will be completely  paralyzed and under their mercy. I suggest we send out Rachel for  negotiations…not that anyone would listen to me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, shit,” Naja whispered, her copper scales  turning chalky. “Oh sweet tap-dancing shit on a mouse. It’s <em>them</em>.  They’re <em>here</em>. It’s <em>time</em>. Oh, gods, my time is  over!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>And then, despite everything that had happened so far,  came the most bizarre sight yet:</p>
<p>Naja started to bawl.</p>
<p>“I don’t wanna go hoooome!” she yelled. “I  don’t wanna get marrieeeeeeed! How did they find me all the way out  heeeeere? Why are they going through all this just so I can  sufferrrrr? Can’t they leave me alooooone? Somebody help  meeeeeeee!”</p>
<p>“Goodness gracious, woman, get a hold of yourself!”  Allegra grimaced.</p>
<p>“Honestly, you’d think they were about to give you  the plague,” Valti sighed. Riene at least appeared sympathetic.</p>
<p>“Oh come on, don’t be so hard on her. I know  exactly what she’s feeling right now.” The Italian looked at Naja  with renewed love and understanding; she unbuckled herself and  reached out to hold her hands. “Are you saying that that’s your  family out there, and they tracked you down so you could honor a  wedding arrangement they made?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm,” she sniveled. Riene sighed.</p>
<p>“I see. They’re taking the phrase ‘shotgun  wedding’ to a whole new extreme. And I thought my folks were bad.”  She hugged the sobbing Elshyrin, but there was nothing anybody could  do. Amy had been knocked out cold from the assault and could not  issue Rachel any orders— not that she would’ve done it anyway—  and soon the <em>Dauntless</em> was, as predicted, completely paralyzed  and under the mercy of an impatient Elshyrin family.</p>
<p>“Oh, kami-sama, please swiftly take this humble  servant into your loving arms,” Fuuka whispered. “I think I’d  rather die than go to a world full of those filthy beasts.”</p>
<p>“You and me both,” Naja sighed.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>While the ladies of the <em>Dauntless</em> were spared  the wrath of their captors, poor Naja was shot with paralyzing agents  the moment they were boarded by the Elshyrin envoy, and so was safely  kept from performing any harm until she came to the surface. Upon  arrival, she was roughly broken away from her slumber by several  slaps to the face and a vile swill that smelled like raw sewage (the  taste, thankfully, was more bearable). The first thing she noticed  was the burden of heat pressing down on her, sweltering searing fire  and humidity soaking the body with the dampness of sweat, parching  the throat, stealing the breath away. Ah, home. Jelrin was a lush,  tropical planet with a stifling temperature, perfectly suited for its  inhabitants. The planet did not tilt on its axis and so all of its  seasons were constant, and since the Elshyrin abhor the cold, they  had long ago amassed around the equator, especially their oceans.</p>
<p>Once she was over the initial shock of the incredible  heat, Naja next observed her people, peering through a window in the  room she had ended up in. Some were what was commonly known as  Lamias, creatures that were human from the waist up and serpentine  from the waist down; they crawled on their bellies and seemed less  fierce than the sort she belonged to. But the majority walked on two  legs and glistened with snaky slickness: green, copper, brown, red,  white, yellow, black, orange; they were an incredibly beautiful and  diverse people.</p>
<p>But certainly not the kind you’d want to be friends  with. “O disgraceful and ungrateful son’s bride, what treachery  has my family conceived that you treat it with such disrespect? Time  and again you have refused to submit to your destiny, even going so  far as to deliberately throw yourself out into the furthest reaches  of space! I can only pray that your tenure with that vessel we found  you hiding in hammered some humility into that dense skull of yours.  I will advise our senators to reconsider the rite of passage our  young must attend to: it needs to be stricter in order to discourage  rebellious upstarts such as yourself!”</p>
<p>“Hello, Lord Orphilis,” Naja moaned wearily. The  man addressing her was none other than her fiancé’s father, one of  the wealthiest and most powerful Elshyrin on the planet, who  controlled nearly half of Jelrin’s mining operations.</p>
<p>“Hello yourself, Sergeant First-Class! Dare I hope  you’ve finally come to your senses at last and are prepared to  marry my son?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather drink ditch water, my lord,” she  spat. Orphilis frowned.</p>
<p>“That and more can be arranged, Miss Elapidae. Bear  in mind, before you say anything that will reap further punishment,  it is only through the friendship your admirable father and I share  that you have not had your limbs hacked off, and <em>dragged </em>to  the ceremony still bleeding! My son, damn his peculiar fashion, is a  cunning and venerable young man. I do not always agree with the  courses of actions he takes, but as he is my only heir, and it would  please me if our two families were joined in union, the least <em>you</em> could do is obey my wishes!”</p>
<p>“HA!! Why not tear me limb from limb now and put me  outta my misery?” Orphilis struck her with the back of his hand,  which was as hard and firm as a frying pan, and wrapped something  cumbersome around her ankles: a chain to keep her from running.</p>
<p>“It seems I am wasting my time, and my breath.  Traveling has made you more impudent than before. Hopefully a few  days in this cell, without food or drink, will cool your head. The  ceremony will begin by the time you are released. Do come to your  senses sooner than that.” He left her with a huff; she rubbed her  cheek and pulled at the chains, but it was a useless gesture. They  were heavy, thick, and the more she struggled, the deeper they cut  into her skin. Naja contemplated biting her feet off and crawling  out— they’d grow back eventually, so what did it matter?— but  the chains suddenly gave her a sharp electrical shock which froze her  for the better part of an hour. The shock set off again just as she  recovered, leaving her no opening for escape.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Feeling powerless was not something Naja Elapidae was  used to.</p>
<p>She began to weep.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>With no food, no water, no rest— the bed she was  given was a slab of rock— and no word from her companions, Naja  began to despair for her fate. A visitor dropped in on her while she  groaned and tried to raise her spirits: a male Elshyrin, green as sin  but amazingly beautiful, as beautiful as she was. It was her  groom-to-be, Sels'eo Orphilis. She greeted him with open hostility,  and were it not for her shackles and her weariness, she certainly  would’ve broken free to slay him.</p>
<p>“I had no idea you were being treated so poorly,”  he said, coming close but not close enough to be touched. “Ah—  forgive me, I ought to have come sooner. It seems you were put into  lodgings ill-suiting members of the Elapidae family. Are you so  adamantly against our marriage, Naja? Is it really worth putting  yourself through all this trouble? I swear I can be a good and loving  husband. You shall have all the riches and positions my family can  offer, and there is nothing you will ever be in need for. At the very  least, please come with me while you reconsider; I shall relocate you  to the finest villa I have to offer.” He smiled and even bowed  before approaching, but she lashed out at him, brushing her clawed  fingers against his hand before the electric shock silenced her.</p>
<p>“Gracious, are you all right?!” he blurted without  thinking.</p>
<p>“Of course I’m not all right, you asshole!” she  snapped, somehow managing to recover from her punishment earlier than  usual. It was the rage and hopelessness; it gave her great strength.  “I’m tied to a fucking death-collar here! It was your own father  that put this on me, so don’t pretend to play nice or anything!!”</p>
<p>“I swear, I had nothing to do with this. His methods  are not my own.”</p>
<p>“I know that well enough,” she grumbled. “The egg  rolled pretty far away from the nest, I’ll say that much. Just get  me outta here, all right? I don’t like that ship of fools, but it’s  a helluva lot better than you!!”</p>
<p>“What do you find so offensive about me, Naja?”  Sels’eo asked, feeling hurt. She glared at him, thinking he had  just asked the stupidest question ever.</p>
<p>“Where should I start? Let’s see… First of all,  you’re not exactly up to the evolutionary code here. I mean, you’re  so…<em>nice</em> that it’s icky. You’ve never pulled a coup,  stabbed someone in the back, blackmailed anyone, sent an innocent  person to prison for your own gain, or anything else that we’re  supposed to be doing here. Second of all, all this affection of yours  just…makes my scales crawl. It’s like every time you so much as  smile at me, it feels like I have to shed to clean myself off. Third,  you basically want me to stay chained to the kitchen stove and pop  out eggs on command, which is something that ain’t happening, pal.  But the fourth and most <em>offensive</em> by far is that fucking male  egotistical bullshit you’re spewing about keeping me locked up away  from my gods-damned <em>dreams</em>!”</p>
<p>Sels’eo stared at her quizzically, as if he honestly  didn’t expect this volcanic response from her. Truth be told, even  if the two of them were not arranged to be married, he still would  have insisted on it. Not every Elshyrin on the planet married for  power or wealth; some, a rogue fraction looked at with disgust and  contempt, honestly did marry for love, but they were few and far  between. The only reason their kind was not completely stamped out,  besides the connections they had and the names they boasted, was  simple biology: not even the most hardcore tyrant could afford to let  the global bloodline get too thick. That had happened before and it  nearly cost the race its future.</p>
<p>“I know I’m a heretic, Naja; it’s what I chose,”  he said defensively. “Father and mother may have raised me  according to standards, but I wanted something better. I wanted to  see if a man like me could <em>succeed</em>, without resorting to…the  common practice. I won’t make any excuses in that regard. I also  can’t help but love you; you’re too strong and proud to dislike.”</p>
<p>“True, but I still ain’t marrying you, buster.”</p>
<p>“It’s a wife’s duty to bear young,” he replied  gently. “It’s the destiny of all women to one day become mothers.  There are very few who can escape their fate.”</p>
<p>“Try saying that to my friends on the <em>Dauntless</em>,”  she muttered.</p>
<p>“Not over the long term, at any rate. There’s  nothing wrong with wanting to repopulate, and I promise I won’t  raise all our children to behave like me. As for wanting to keep you  home, you <em>do</em> realize your military term ended, and you were  given a dishonorable discharge. Where do you think a person with that  record could go to serve? No branch of any armed forces will take you  in, Naja, so you had best give up that dream. Your place is on Jelrin  anyway; I won’t force you to stay in the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“But I’ll still be here,” she grumbled with a  gesture. Sels’eo placed her chin in his palm and raised her face up  to kiss her, but she bit down on his tongue and struck him.</p>
<p>“Would that really be so bad?!” he sputtered. “You  belong here, with your own kind! I have nothing against you having  other friends, but they’re not Elshyrin, Naja. As different as I  am, I’m still closer to you than they are! You can’t deny that.”</p>
<p>“No, but I sure would like to,” she snarled. He  sighed and reached for her; she hissed and bared her fangs.</p>
<p>“You’re coming to my villa whether you like it or  not. Regardless of how you feel, you don’t deserve to be stuck in  this dump. Maybe after you see how good I can be, you’ll change  your mind. I’m sorry, but I want to be your husband. I don’t know  why you feel like you need to keep running out on me.” He moved to  the chain and started to loosen it, and Naja prepared for her chance.</p>
<p>“If you free me, Sels’eo, I will kill you. That  will be the end of it.”</p>
<p>“The Admiral and my father would still find someone  else for you to marry,” he said nonchalantly. “But I’ve waited  too long to miss out on this now. I’m sorry, but I’m going to  have to put you to sleep.”</p>
<p>“HA! Fat chance, dick-head! What, are you gonna slip  me a mickey or someth— ”</p>
<p>KER-CLANG!! Sels’eo knocked her out cold and Naja’s  world became utter darkness.</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>Three hours later, Naja was still nursing her sore head  as bride’s maids fluttered around her, preparing her for the  ceremony. They gently clawed over her body to pry away loose scales,  dabbled her with the finest perfumes (bought by the in-laws, no  less), crowned her with a ring of flowers, filed her nails, and  tailored and retailored her ceremonial robes. All the while she was  being preened and pampered, Naja tried to think which offense was  more vulgar: her marriage, all the trouble these people were willing  to go through for it, or that none of her family was there to see it.  Admiral Kluor and Senior Diplomat Aashirin were away on a meeting  regarding the galactic alliance, perhaps speaking with Aseria’s  itinerate father. Naja was glad they weren’t here to gawk or puff  out their chests, but really now! She might have hated all of this  but at least her parents could <em>be</em> there.</p>
<p>The only good thing about this so far was how  incredible those robes made her look. She could say what she wanted  to about her future in-laws, but they spared no expense here. The  only better place to find garments like these would be in the Prime  Minister’s house. Even so, it didn’t cloak her despair, or hide  her misery. Naja would have to face facts that there was no escaping  this: soon she would be the unwilling wife of a spineless, gentle,  soft-hearted do-gooder, about the worst fate any Elshyrin could ask  for. Naja thought about her companions as she looked at herself in  the mirror, and couldn’t help but shed a tear. They were all  idiots, of course, hardly any of them worth the dust she cast  aside…but they were better than this. Because of Jelrin’s laws  concerning foreigners— they were almost always executed on sight—  they wouldn’t even be able to visit. It would take a miracle and  more for her to escape now.</p>
<p>Naja was stabbed quite painfully in the arm as she  tumbled onto a protruding pin one of her fussy maids was holding, and  she screeched and struck her hard enough to break bone. It wasn’t  her fault; the ground was shaking and shouts could be heard from  outside. Taking advantage of the distraction, Naja yanked the pin out  and fought her way through to see what the commotion was. Everybody  was too busy rushing to notice one runaway bride: the Jelrin elite  guard was out in full force, throwing themselves at what seemed to be  a large ship and a battalion of females that were blessedly familiar.  Naja’s cold serpentine heart actually skipped a beat.</p>
<p>“Snakes, snakes, everywhere snakes!!” Fuuka  screamed. Kate, Lillianne, Aseria, Athena, Mink, Sharyn, and Valti  were leading the charge, plowing through Elshyrin left and right. Eve  and Allegra were in the rear, taking potshots with dummy ammunition;  Yenae and Alala were slinking through the crowd, taking down Elshyrin  snipers and bowmen; in the middle was Amy Miracle, waving her crutch  around wildly as Lyara supported her.</p>
<p>“Fall back! Rachel, give them a blizzard!”</p>
<p>“No problem!” Naja winced and jumped back to avoid  the icy blast. This was a phenomenon never before seen on Jelrin, and  dozens, perhaps hundred of her kinfolk fell to the ground, shivering  uncontrollably. A shock force arrived just in time to even the odds.</p>
<p>“Don’t spare any of them! Fire!”</p>
<p>“Did someone say ‘fire’?!” Kyrie squealed. She  threw a flask and struck a match, causing an impenetrable wall of  fire to rise up. The Elshyrin yelled and retreated; meanwhile, the  women of the <em>Dauntless</em> pressed on. Naja raced to the front of  the chapel to greet them, but was stopped by two large,  heavily-armored Elshyrin. They pinned her to the wall and put a knife  to her throat.</p>
<p>“Behave yourself, Lady Elapidae, if only for today!  They’ll be dead soon and you’ll be married. Why don’t you give  up and accept that?”</p>
<p>“Fuck you jackasses!” she roared. The door to the  chapel suddenly began to groan, and splintered under the pressure of  Rachel banging against it.</p>
<p>“Stop the wedding!” Amy shouted. “Citizens of  Jelrin, return our comrade to us! No woman should be forced into a  marriage she doesn’t want!”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It took them a few seconds to realize the auditorium was  almost completely empty.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Uh, whoops,” Yenae said. “I think we’re a  little early. So much for our grand entrance.”</p>
<p>“Great timing, jack-holes!” Naja shouted. “Come  over here and get these losers offa me!”</p>
<p>“No thanks at all,” Athena sighed.</p>
<p>“I just want everyone to know that this is completely  against my will!” Fuuka exclaimed. Eve shot the two guards with  dummy blasts, knocking them cold, and Naja rushed towards her  companions with open arms and colorful words.</p>
<p>“You ass-eating bitches were gonna leave me here I  can’t believe what a lousy group of fucking morons I got stuck with  why didn’t you pieces of shit come here sooner I was gonna kill  myself I’ll bet you wanted that to happen you lame puss-eating  spineless fools…”</p>
<p>“Good to see you too!” Aseria huffed. “And for  your information, we put it to a vote. If you have to curse at  anyone, do it to Valti. She’s the one that convinced us all to come  save you.”</p>
<p>“Well, me and Miracle here,” Brignor squeaked  humbly. “But now I think maybe we should get outta here.”</p>
<p>“Fuck you, Valti!! What the hell kinda plan you got  for that, huh? There’s a squadron of ships stationed on our moon on  orders to surround the planet if any outsiders set foot. Do ya think  you can just break through there?”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Everyone suddenly turned pale; Naja crossed  her arms and sighed wearily.</p>
<p>“Yeah, <em>oh</em>. Still, I’m grateful you guys  came. I guess if I have to go down, I’d rather it be with a bunch  of losers like you than that asshole of a fiancé of mine.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think we’ll have to worry about getting  killed by the blockade,” said Teleah Acheron. She and her sister  were wearing headphones, and had a radio with them. “Yeah, they  should be arriving shortly.”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“The greater of two evils,” Kayleigh stated. “The  reason we came when we did was because we wanted to time our rescue  in accordance with a second invasion wave. Our radar picked up a  convoy of unidentified ships closing in on Elshyrin space, and so we  figured that if we got here before them, we could leave during the  commotion. In short, the blockade will be too busy fighting their <em>other</em> enemies to worry about us.” Naja’s jaw almost fell  to the floor as she stood stricken and awed.</p>
<p>“Are you making that up?!” she screeched. Teleah  pointed to an alarm that had just gone off, smirking when an Elshyrin  announced the arrival of unknown enemies. Naja felt like strangling  them both for their smug behavior. “And what would you have done if  there weren’t any enemies?”</p>
<p>“Probably send you a bridal endowment,” they  smirked.</p>
<p>“Oh, WHATEVER!! Jeez!”</p>
<p><em>Shit, they’re as devious as I am! Maybe I’ve had  them pegged wrong. Heh, I could get in bed with those two! I bet  they’d made better lovers than anyone else on this fun-boat!</em></p>
<p>“Anyway, if that’s your plan, then we’d better  get to it. I don’t care who these new guys think they are, but  they’re gonna wish they were in Hell before the blockade gets  finished with them.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As the newly-reunited crew raced through the emptying  streets of the Jelrin city, they heard a call for all available  pilots and commanders to scramble to their ships and engage the  enemy. Glancing at the sky had the girls seeing flashes of light,  explosions, and falling chunks of debris as enemy and ally were shot  down and destroyed in the atmosphere. The Acherons reported that the  enemy numbered a hundred strong, but they were mostly small fighters,  hardly large enough for one person. The biggest threat was the  unknown dreadnought commanding and spawning them.</p>
<p>“Spawning?!” Naja blurted.</p>
<p>“Yes, spawning. The reports are saying that more  fighters are coming from the mother ship. It’s safe to assume that  they either have plenty of expendable soldiers…”</p>
<p>“Clones,” Teleah added.</p>
<p>“Or they’re Fog Ninjas.”</p>
<p>“Oh, great. So the blockade could be fighting  indefinitely.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it, but it’ll give us more time. In ya  go!” Naja shucked off her coronet and smeared her makeup off (but  kept the robe), but before she could board, she heard a whiny voice  calling out to her, and shuddered.</p>
<p>“Naja! Naja, hold on a minute! Why are you running  away again? Please, just give up and marry me! You know I won’t  stop until I make you my bride!”</p>
<p>“Grow up, Sels’eo!” she snarled, giving him a  firm kick as he came close. “I don’t want to get married to <em>anyone, EVER!</em> I’d like to say it’s nothing personal,  but…gods DAMN it, you’re a pussy! I mean, hell— Miracle here’s  more ruthless than you! All you can do is bitch and moan  and…and…throw poetry around! So get lost, and don’t follow  me!!”</p>
<p>“I resent that remark,” Amy muttered as she fixed  her glasses.</p>
<p>“Wait!” he called, but it was too late. The <em>Dauntless</em> was taking off and Naja was gone from his life once  again. Sels’eo watched it lift off, but refused to give up, and  raced to his personal spacecraft. Battle or no battle, refusal or no  refusal, he wouldn’t give let go of the woman he loved— not now,  not ever.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Mmm, who would’ve thought that Naja’s fiancé  was such a dish!” Valti purred.</p>
<p>“Eww, that’s gross,” Fuuka cringed. The six-armed  woman sighed dreamily.</p>
<p>“What a waste of a beautiful man, too! To think he’s  supposed to marry our vile little Elshyrin. Oh well…”</p>
<p>“Can it!” Naja screamed, swinging and missing her.</p>
<p>“We’ve got more important things to worry about,”  said Miracle. “Our enemies are still out there and they’re  fighting tooth and nail. I don’t know if the <em>Dauntless</em> can  get away without serious damage.”</p>
<p>“Who’s getting away?!” Naja exclaimed. “I’m  not gonna sit on my ass and watch a group of smoke monsters attack my  Jelrin! We’re gonna take the fight to them and blow that mother  ship to kingdom come!”</p>
<p>“Golly, ain’t you a puzzle and a riddle wrapped up  in a mystery!” Allegra said. “One minute yer wrigglin’ and  rasslin’ to get away, and the next ya wanna save everybody!”</p>
<p>“I have my pride, too,” she announced darkly. “It’s  not Jelrin I hate, just my idiot fiancé. Who among you would turn  their back on their home world?” Kate knew she would, but she  didn’t want to speak up and ruin the moment; nobody else said  anything, either. “Then it’s decided. Okay, I’m taking command!  Eve, Allegra, Kyrie, I want you on the guns! Herut, Becky, Shana,  you’ll be maintenance. Kate, Sharyn, Lil, you’re ammo transport.  Acherons, Aseria, you’re our pilots. Mink, bitch-meat, you’re on  sick bay. Yenae, you and Alala will supervise the smaller groups.  Rachel, I need you defending us, and don’t you dare say no,  Miracle! The rest of you, tie down everything that could come loose,  close all the doors we don’t need, and keep the fire extinguishers  ready. If these guys are as easy in space as they are on the ground,  we’ll be done in no time!”</p>
<p>“Who made you boss?” Lyara snorted.</p>
<p>“Do as she says!” Amy shouted. The elf paled.</p>
<p>“Yes <em>ma’am</em>.” Everyone scrambled to their  stations, and for the first time in a very long while, Naja could  stick her chin out and be proud. She finally had a crew again.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The battle begun as a horde of small enemy fighters  swarmed their way. Naja shouted, “Here they come!”; Allegra and  Kyrie dusted off seven in a large burst. The <em>Dauntless</em> pressed  forward, sometimes swerving, sometimes leaping and twirling through  space, sometimes taking impact from suicidal foes. It felt like  asteroids were crashing against the hull as the enemies splashed  against them— and why not, they were easily replaced— even the  ship’s thick armor plating wouldn’t stand up under that kind of  attack. Eve squeezed one of her eyes shut and grinned as she emptied  her first salvo, blasting fifteen fighters into space particles.</p>
<p>“HA!” Naja screamed. “That was nothing!!”  Aseria increased thrust and the <em>Dauntless</em> plowed through thick  walls of fighters on its way to the mother ship. Elshyrin battle  cruisers belched flame and showers of lasers, wiping clean scores of  fighters; more came to replace the fallen, congesting the darkness  with their staggering numbers. The <em>Dauntless</em> picked uyp speed  and fired again, taking out dozens. Rachel, flying outside the ship’s  barrier, waved her arm and swept their numbers away like dust,  throwing some towards the planet where they careened to the surface  or were scorched upon entry.</p>
<p>“These peons aren’t worth my time,” Naja  proclaimed theatrically. “Full speed to the mother ship! We’ll  engage her in single combat!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that?” Alala said. “I mean,  take a look! It’s gotta be at least five times bigger— ”</p>
<p>“All the better! It’s the Elshyrin law to always  challenge those stronger than you!”</p>
<p>“We’re not Elshyrin, you know,” she muttered. The <em>Dauntless</em> charged regardless of her populace; it swept through  the fighters and stared down the enormous mother ship across the  vastness of space. It was already engaging several Elshyrin units,  but the battle was fairly one-sided: several ally vessels were  already going down, and many more were being bombarded. Naja  commanded that a line be opened so she could teach “those novice  bastards” a lesson.</p>
<p>“Move outta the way! This here’s my prey! I’m  going to be the one to blow him apart!”</p>
<p>“Who the hell is this?” they demanded sharply.  “Unidentified vessel, stand down and give us your registration  number! You are in violation of Elshyrin space and must— ”</p>
<p>“OH, SHOVE IT UP YOUR SCALY ASS!!!” She commanded  her gunners to go full blast; a wall of fire and destruction shot  out, striking ally and enemy both. Naja even laughed out loud as the  mother ship focused all its attention on the <em>Dauntless</em> and  launched sonic disrupters.</p>
<p>“We’ve got unfriendly fire at port side,” Yenae  warned.</p>
<p>“Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!”</p>
<p>“Are we gonna ram it?!” she balked.</p>
<p>“Why not?!” Naja exclaimed. “The <em>Dauntless</em> is coated with a special metal, right? Any officer worth her salt  could recognize that ship for what it’s made of! We’ll tear  through them like a plastic wrapper!”</p>
<p>“You’d better not!” Alala screamed to the pilots.  Fortunately, not even the Acheron sisters were <em>that </em>cavalier.</p>
<p>“There’s more to life than glory, Naja. Right now  we have to focus on those disruptors.”</p>
<p>“So? Blast them outta the sky!”</p>
<p>“No effect!” Allegra called from the gun ports.  “They ain’t normal SD shots, that’s for sure!”</p>
<p>“Evasive action!”</p>
<p>“What do you think we’ve been trying to do all this  time?!” Aseria spat. “They act like guided missiles; we can’t  evade. They’re going to have to hit something, and unless those  fighters decide to go suicidal again, it looks like it’s going to  be us!” Naja gnashed her teeth in frustration. She was close enough  now to taste victory on her forked tongue— why did she have to be  delayed like this?</p>
<p>“Obstacles everywhere,” she snarled. To make  matters worse, a small Elshyrin cruiser was spotted approaching them,  hailing them with a frequency Naja had hoped she would never hear.</p>
<p>“Naja! What in the name of the gods… You’re  always getting into trouble, aren’t you my love?”</p>
<p>“Aww, it’s prince charming!” Valti squealed. Naja  swung again and missed.</p>
<p>“Sels’eo, this is not the time or the place! Why  don’t you just get yourself blown up or someth— ” Suddenly,  Naja got the most brilliant idea, something so vile and sinister that  she couldn’t help but grin. Everyone around her froze solid as she  suddenly yelled out, “Aaah, help me, Sels’eo! They shot sonic  disruptors at us! If we can’t escape, we’ll be dead meat out  here! Please, do something!”</p>
<p>“I’m coming!!” he shouted without the slightest  bit of hesitation. His vessel intercepted the destructive bombs and  was instantly crippled; the poor fool floated helplessly through  space, proclaiming his love, as Naja chuckled darkly.</p>
<p>“Sucker.”</p>
<p>“One less thing to worry about,” the Acherons  sighed. “Now all that’s left is the main ship. If we are going to  charge that thing, we’ll do it carefully. No sense getting everyone  onboard killed.”</p>
<p>“You underestimate my ship!” she crowed, completely  intoxicated with the lust of the conquest. “After all, she won  third place in the Centanian Space Race, and she’s been halfway  around the galaxy and back with barely a scratch! One silly little  Fog Ninja ship isn’t going to scare her!”</p>
<p>“It’s not your ship, it’s Amy’s!” Alala  screamed.</p>
<p>“Actually, it’s on loan from the other galaxy,”  Miracle groaned. She had an impressive green glow on her skin and  looked ready to lose her lunch. Kay and Tee had to break all their  old records just to keep from being bombarded by the waves of  fighters surging from the mother ship. Their firepower was  negligible, but a kamikaze attack really wounded the <em>Dauntless</em> in the long run; the ship looked as crippled and sick as its  pigtailed owner.</p>
<p>“Details, details,” Naja waved dismissively. Sharyn  suddenly ran up from the lower decks, desperate and out of breath.</p>
<p>“Our munitions are dwindling! Ere a quarter hour’s  passed, we’ll be naught but fish in a barrel!”</p>
<p>“Damn it, now’s not the time for poetry, greenie!”</p>
<p>“She means we ain’t got nothing to shoot them  with!” Yenae spat. Naja looked as unconcerned as ever, no surprises  there, and laughed dismissively.</p>
<p>“So what? I told you to ram this sucker! Tell Kyrie  to move to the engine room and run us full blast! Shields at maximum  on the port side! Miracle, you tell Rachel to strengthen the hull! I  dunno, solder some of that debris on it or something— whatever  works!”</p>
<p>“Art thou intent on venturing this course of action?  Art thou prepared for the consequences?”</p>
<p>“Whatever Shakespeare said, tell her to shut up and  get outta here! We’re punching right through that mother-fucker and  that’s my final decision!” As everyone stood around petrified  with fear, Amy recovered from her nausea a little and gave them a  firm stare.</p>
<p>“It’s the best course of action I can think of.  Rachel, go ahead and gather all the space-debris you can, and shape  it into a drill, or a wedge, or something we can use to pierce  through the enemy mother ship, then fuse it to the nose. Got that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master!” The sprightly genie vanished in a  cloud of smoke, and as the <em>Dauntless</em> careened towards their  foe, whether for victory or oblivion, the crew prayed that they would  all make it out safe. Meanwhile, Naja gave Amy a smirk of approval,  to which the older woman tittered nervously.</p>
<p>“You know, you’d make a pretty decent subordinate  for me.”</p>
<p>“Oh no, not with this foot. But I could definitely  see you as a commander.” Naja turned around and swelled with pride.  She didn’t budge an inch as a mechanical construction began to form  on the nose of the <em>Dauntless</em>, or when it ran full speed at the  mother ship, or when enemy fighters surrounded them, or when it  pierced through like a bullet, spreading destruction and havoc as it  passed, scraped and dented and torn with the beautiful scars of  victory against all odds.</p>
<p>“Time to finish the job!” Naja proclaimed with a  wave of her arm. “All guns fire! Release a ballast of explosives!  Let’s deliver a present they’ll <em>never </em>forget!!” She  squinted as her orders were carried out; the enemy vessel was alit in  a conflagration. Naja Elapidae actually wept for joy as the <em>Dauntless</em> emerged out the other end, a crumpled mass of its former self,  staggering away from its big fat kill with the halo of triumph  glowing around it.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Naja was strangely quiet as the <em>Dauntless</em> resumed its journey to Epitaph. One would think that after saving her  home world, being reinstated in the military (and being promoted to  Captain, no less), forgiven for her past offenses, applauded for her  wit and guile, AND freed from any marital obligations to “that male  who brings shame to our race”, she’d be a lot happier, or at  least more expressive. Naja had everything she could ever want  now…but perhaps having it all wasn’t as grand as everyone  supposes. After all, having a desire can be a wonderful thing,  despite what the religious will say, and when those desires become  real, what should be wanting? When a person no longer desires, what  is there left for them to accomplish? Naja no longer had anything to  wish for.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s back to the old grind,” she sighed.  She turned around and tried to smile in spite of her feelings. As  usual, the <em>Dauntless</em> was being overrun by chaos, insanity, and  a plethora of emotions and opinions, all crashing together in what  could either be the ultimate wreck or the most unexpected sanctuary—  in short, same old, same old.</p>
<p>“That’s okay,” she said contentedly, returning to  her meditation, “I suppose.”</p>

<p><em><u>Preview of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Rachel: Well, that was…um, enlightening! And speaking  of things that are bright, are we in for a glaring time in the next  chapter! We might arrive on Epitaph, but the focus changes to all the  secondary characters! How dull is that? Still, I guess it’s all  right if we get back to these people from time to time, if only to  remind everyone they still exist! There’s a lot of boring things  going on in the next installment, but hang in there, okay? It’s the  final chapter of the volume, “The Galactic Alliance: deus ex  machina”! I don’t know about you, but I hope we get back to some  action, adventure, and good old-fashioned lesbian sex!</p>
<p>Amy: Um…<em>right</em>.</p>
<p>Rachel: Wheeeee!!!</p>
