<h1>Duet (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/duet-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>After dinner, everyone settled down and started to fall asleep in front
of the TV.

Crystal takes a quick shower, and walks in on Janice naked only to find
two other girls in her room. Janice quickly puts two fingers to Crystal&#39;s
lips and whispers. &quot;They&#39;re not going home. And for good reason. look.&quot;

Sitting in the huge walk in closet were two girls. They were just like
Janice/Crystal, one was white, the other black, but that&#39;s where the
comparison ended. Both were younger than Janice/Crystal (19), yet like
Janice &amp; Crystal both only had eyes for each other. Cuddled into each
others embrace as they kissed passionately. &quot;I told them they could have
the walk-in closet for privacy.&quot; Janice whispered, closing the door
behind them.

&quot;Their parents are a bunch of racists, but these two are adults now so
they can get out from under their parents grips and be free to love as
they wish. So I&#39;m sending them upstate to be with a lesbian couple I know
who&#39;ll help them settle in and make a life for themselves.&quot; (leans head
on Crystal&#39;s shoulder) &quot;I wish we could have been like them.&quot;

&quot;In the closet while they take the bed?&quot;

&quot;No! I want the bed. I meant I wish I met you when we were their age.&quot;
(touches Crystal&#39;s cheek, staring deeply into her eyes) &quot;No false starts,
no Mike, nothing but us would have mattered, the world be damned.&quot;

&quot;Nothing but you and me is all that matters to me.&quot; (kisses Janice on the
lips) &quot;Now are we going to stand here all day or are we going. ahh!!&quot;

Janice wasted no time in suckling Crystal&#39;s breasts, massaging and
pinching one as she carefully worked on the other.

Carefully Janice moved her to the bed, lying her down as she gained full
control over the lovemaking, lashing her tongue over the other girl&#39;s
upper body over and over again, bringing little pips of gasps and moans
from each lash of the tongue. Crystal reaches down, holding Janice&#39;s
head. Suddenly her hands quickly move down, jerking Janice up as Crystal
rolls her over to take dominant position over her, panting as she did,
stripping the small clothes Janice was wearing until the other girl was
as naked as she was. Crystal breath came up in short pants as she sat on
top of her lover&#39;s nude form.

&quot;I&#39;m not wearing you out already, am I?&quot; Janice slyly remarked with a
grin, pulling the other girl down to her level to deeply kiss her,
playing a little game tongue to tongue before Crystal pushes away
smiling. &quot;I thought you said I get to play with your lovely toys when we
were an item?&quot;

&quot;So I did. So I did.&quot; Janice starts to roll over, only Crystal wasn&#39;t
ready to relinquish her control yet. She pushes her back down and grabs
onto her breasts. &quot;Not yet, I want to hear you say it.&quot; Carefully she
leans down, and begins to lick at Janice&#39;s breasts, lashing her tongue
across the sensitive flesh and nipples, making each nipple grow harder as
Janice rasped and wiggled under the other woman&#39;s control.
&quot;Crys--crystal!&quot;

&quot;Say it.&quot; (a few more lashes of the tongue across Janice&#39;s firm nipples)
&quot;Say it.&quot;

&quot;I. I want you!&quot; Janice finally hisses. Her words, though jumbled abit
from the tormenting playful antics Crystal was doing on her, was clear
enough. &quot;I want you better than Mike ever had you! I want you screaming
MY name! I want you begging for me! I want to make love to you with
dignity, not the fuckin&#39; near blind drugged rape that fucker Mike calls
sex! I want you to enjoy sex, not tolerate it!&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Crystal sighs. &quot;I&#39;ll never have to drink to enjoy sex again. as
long as you&#39;re the one I&#39;m making love to, it&#39;ll be heaven every night as
long as it the two of us.&quot; Finally Crystal relents and allows Janice to
fetch her toybox. She opens the box and gives Crystal a shock. &quot;.oh
goddess. so many wonderful toys.&quot;

She carefully picks up a few, feels them in her hands, and makes her
choice. The first of many choices for the two of them for a long time to
come.

&quot;This one.&quot; Crystal holds up a strap on, ribbed for her pleasure.

&quot;Nice pick. I&#39;d love to give this a go.&quot; Janice smiles as she kisses
Crystal on the cheek, turning away to strap the device into place without
Crystal watching, gasping slightly as the shorter end slid into her,
coating her fingers in her wetness. Briefly Janice listens to the other
two, hearing only soft moans and heavy breathing from the closet.

&quot;That looks good on you.&quot; Crystal coos softly, head poking over Janice&#39;s
shoulder. &quot;No peeking!&quot; she suddenly gasps, pushing Crystal onto her
back. &quot;First.&quot; her hands press between Crystal&#39;s legs, spreading them as
reaching down, &quot;Let&#39;s make sure your ready. Don&#39;t want you to be.&quot;
(sighs) &quot;.so wet too. Your ready.&quot; (briefly tastes the liquid on her
fingertips as she moves forward between the other girl&#39;s legs. Crystal&#39;s
breath came up in gasps, her eyes widened as her hips wiggled in
anticipation of what was to come. She looked needy and desperate, she
wanted it, and that made Janice feel something inside her. &#39;She wants me.
not Mike. me. she wants me hard and.&#39; (for a brief second she felt
powerful, but quickly she shoves those thoughts aside)

&#39;NO! I&#39;m not Mike. Not an animal. Make love to her as a woman should be
loved. don&#39;t hurt her. never.&#39;

Crystal groaned loudly as Janice filled her fully, stopping when
Crystal&#39;s legs suddenly lunged themselves around her torso, holding her
tightly to her. She was fully engulfed in the other girl&#39;s body, and she
was shuddering from the depths she was feeling from this. &quot;Mike. always
rushed it. never made it last.&quot; (sobs once) &quot;. please. make it last.
please.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot; Gently, yet firmly, Janice kisses the hollow of Crystal&#39;s
throat sighing as she does. &quot;As long as possible.&quot;

And with that Crystal&#39;s legs relaxed, allowing Janice to begin to thrust.
Slowly at first, growing with intensity as their pleasures rose.
Crystal&#39;s moans and groans got more frequent as they made love, her own
hips thrusting up to meet with each thrust of Janice&#39;s, matching her
tempo beat by beat, and pace by pace.

For a second Crystal wanted to cry, then a tear slide down her face.

She was sober. Completely in control of her own emotions and not drunk as
hell. Yet she was in heaven, which she never thought she could be without
liquor to make sex bearable. But this. this was heaven itself. No
alcohol, no pain, no madness, just pure love without inhibitors or the
madness of the way Mike had sex with her. This was beautiful, and for a
moment she wished they did meet when she was young, then her years would
have been filled with Janice&#39;s strength, her compassion, her attention,
and her love. But they had years ahead of them now. Years to love, and no
one to stand in their way or bar their passions. Like the two in the
closet they were free, and never again would she let anyone clip her
wings.

Suddenly the world ceased to be for her, and only Janice and the
maddening pleasure she was rippling through her body remained. Crystal&#39;s
body tensed up as she was being stroked to orgasm. She was screaming now,
hands holding Janice tightly, fingernails raking flesh as she rose
upwards. Finally, as she hit her summit, she screamed so loudly that
Janice wanted to cry herself, but her own world slipped away quickly in a
haze of passion as she screamed, her own eruption of pleasure hitting her
at once.

For long seconds neither could move, trembling as they slide down the
slope of their peak, breaths ragged and strained. Janice wanted to fall
down but held tight, not pulling out of Crystal even for a second. As
they finally recovered their strength, Crystal nudged herself forward and
pushed Janice down onto her back, straddling the strap on as she did so.
Crystal&#39;s hand gently guided Janice&#39;s hands to her breasts, compelling
her to massage them as she slowly began to slide up and down, her breath
beginning to gasp again with each stroke.

&quot;Goddess.&quot; Janice gasped, using her hands to both massage Crystal&#39;s
breasts and to help in the upward strokes. As they made love in this new
way, Janice could feel Crystal nearing her peak again, smiling as she
massaged her breasts and helped her reach her peak with a slow deliberate
pacing to drive her crazy.

Sensing Janice&#39;s own need, Crystal leans forward, offering a nipple mere
inches from Janice&#39;s waiting lips, which is quickly sucked up and
ravished by her, bringing new moans of approval from Crystal.

As she picked up her pace, Crystal began to cry out how incredible it all
was. The sheer energy flowing through her, the sexual pleasure,
everything. Her pace increased, her teeth clenched, her free breast was
bouncing so crazily that Janice had to grab it and massage it just to
settle it down. As she did, Crystal came with a tremendous power, her
eyes rolled back abit and it felt like her heart was going to stop. but
it didn&#39;t.

She kept pounding down over and over until she was completely drained,
she quickly pulled off and settled down next to Janice. For seconds she
stared at the strap on, then she yanked it off with fumbling hands and
buried her face into Janice.

&quot;W-wh--?!?&quot;

&quot;.you didn&#39;t cum.&quot;

&quot;Goddess your.&quot; (Janice&#39;s witty remark falls silent as she gasps for
breath)

Quickly one of Crystal&#39;s hands grabs for the box, pulling a dildo free
she plunges it into Janice, laying her head sideways to catch her breath
as her hands work the dildo into Janice fiercely. Suddenly she could feel
Janice&#39;s hand clawing at her rear, yanking it down onto her face until
she felt the other woman&#39;s tongue slash into her sensitive spot. Whipping
and flicking her tongue like a woman possessed, Janice was well gone by
now and lost in her lustful haze, driven to return pleasure for pleasure
as her world faded into a pink blissful haze.

&quot;.Jan. oh damn.&quot; (gasps repeatedly) &quot;.your insatiable!&quot; Quickly Crystal
threw the dildo aside and devoured Janice whole, tongue driven deep into
her womanhood as fiercely as she was being given back in turn by the
woman beneath her.

Crystal&#39;s world, already hazy pleasure, sank deeper as she suddenly flew
into the grips of a brand new orgasm, as Janice&#39;s orgasm hit. Both women
were rewarded with a torrent of cum from each of them, splashing all over
their mouths as they gulped down as much as they could. Both women crying
out, their voices smothered by each other&#39;s pussy that covered their
mouths, making each woman&#39;s body shiver as they screamed into each other
until finally collapsing into a pile on the bed, sated and satisfied for
now.

After long seconds Janice helps Crystal back up to her, lying side by
side.

&quot;You were holding back on me. all this time.&quot; Janice sighed.

&quot;And I still have more. once I catch my breath.&quot;

Both women lean over and kiss, tasting each other&#39;s flavors on their
lips, and savoring the sweetness mixed with tart in their essences.
Janice pulls Crystal close, allowing her to nuzzle Janice&#39;s breasts as
they laid contentedly on the bed.

For the longest time silence reigned, mostly because nothing needed to be
said between them. Occasionally Crystal would rub her head against
Janice&#39;s breasts, or Janice would flick Crystal&#39;s nipples with a free
hand, but both girls were drained and just happy to be in each other&#39;s
arms. Finally, Janice asked the obvious.

&quot;Are you thinking about him?&quot;

&quot;Not the way your thinking.&quot; Crystal sighs. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I let him
rule over me for so long. confusing lust with love. but this is love.&quot;
(she sighs) &quot;Because this feeling in me doesn&#39;t stop after sex. It
remains, and grows, not vanishing when I&#39;m in bed until the next time I
have sex. It&#39;s always there.&quot; (looks up into Janice&#39;s eyes) &quot;Because you
will always be there. forever.&quot;

&quot;.forever.&quot; Janice whispers, feeling a weight finally and fully lift from
her shoulders. The last of her fears gone, her happy ever after achieved.

&quot;Round 3 after a quick nap?&quot; Janice asks warily.

&quot;Round 3 in 5 minutes. Naps are for wimps. And next time.&quot; (hand reaching
over to touch the strap on lightly) &quot;I get to play with the toys.&quot;

Janice smiles, and sighs, shivering in anticipation for the five minutes
to be up.

-----

The next day she let Crystal sleep in, making breakfast later than usual.

After all, Crystal wasn&#39;t in a rush anymore. No more running back to a
failed marriage. She was going to stay here for now on, and be loved as
she truly deserved.

By the time Crystal woke up, most of the girls except the two lovers were
gone.

And after breakfast those two were gone too, picked up by the two Janice
mentioned last night and ferried upstate. This left Janice the job of
permanently moving Crystal into her home, which meant a head on collision
with Mike. Before Crystal woke up, Janice called Johnson and asked for a
little help from her old friend. He would be there, out of sight, keeping
an eye on things. If things went south, he&#39;d jump in. But all in all,
Janice just as soon would rather things didn&#39;t go south if she could help
it.

At first Janice wanted to talk Crystal out of it, but she insisted on
telling Mike she&#39;s leaving him forever, and having her last words with
him. The trip down was rather silent, which was normal because Crystal
was about to make the biggest change of her life. As she opened the door
and let them into her now former home, she noticed something was
different.

&quot;Mike&#39;s not up yet? He&#39;d be fuming right about now.&quot;

A minute later Mike exited the bedroom, stopping to note Janice.

&quot;You bringing your loud bitch friends over now?&quot;

&quot;.&quot; Janice sighed as she sat down on the couch, watching Crystal walk
into the bathroom and drag Mike with her. Mike didn&#39;t look too happy with
her, but Janice didn&#39;t care a whit since she was about to send his world
crashing down. Serves him right.

&quot;Well, he&#39;s a real charmer. not.&quot;

Suddenly the bedroom door opened again and a female stumbled out, half
naked.

Both Janice &amp; Yvette exchanged glances, and both girls groan audibly.

&quot;What the hell are YOU doing here?&quot; Janice hisses.

&quot;I could ask YOU the same question!&quot; (Yvette sighs) &quot;Thought you had
yourself a new girlfriend to play with, and she kept you busy in bed
alot.&quot;

&quot;Been talking to Johnson again, huh? Meanwhile, just so we&#39;re clear on
this, I thought you were playing big shot as your own personal
Goddess/Bounty Hunter! What the hell are you doing shacking up with a
no-brainer like Mike?&quot;

&quot;You know his name? Oh fuck, your not going to arrest him, are you?&quot;
(curses) &quot;Thought your new dyke would keep you off the streets for more
hours each day!&quot;

&#39;God, please keep me from blowing her brains out.&#39; Janice thought to
herself.

&quot;My. ahem. &quot;new dyke&quot; is moving out of here and becoming my permanent
love interest. She&#39;s (by the way) the former wife of the man your hoe-ing
with.&quot;

&quot;H-O. H-O. If your going to insult me, do it right!&quot; (Yvette sighs) &quot;Ever
going to learn how to speak slang?&quot;

&quot;Ever going to learn how to speak English?&quot;

&quot;Fuck you.&quot;

&quot;No thanks, I don&#39;t do hoes.&quot;

&quot;HO, NOT.&quot; (sighs) &quot;.I give up.&quot;

Suddenly Crystal comes barreling out of the bathroom and into the
bedroom, followed closely behind by Mike.

&quot;Hope she doesn&#39;t pack my clothes away by accident.&quot; Yvette sighs.

-----

&quot;So that&#39;s it? You ain&#39;t even gonna say anything?&quot; Mike asks puzzled. He
is standing in the bedroom with only his boxer shorts on, trying to shake
the cobwebs out of his head.

&quot;What is there to say Mike? I see you&#39;re happy with that tramp bitch
Yvette.&quot; Crystal fumes as she continues stuffing her belongings into a
suitcase.

&quot;Yeah well, at least it&#39;s a natural human behavior situation. Nothing
weird and strange.&quot; Mike quips.

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean Mike?&quot; Crystal steams, pausing momentarily.

&quot;It means what it sounds like. I thought you&#39;d at least be with another
dude, not some dyke bitch. Heh. Heh.&quot; Mike allows, the liquor seeping
through his pores.

&quot;You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about. What Jan and I have is real.
Not some bullshit sadistic ritual that&#39;s hidden inside of a bottle.&quot;
Crystal snaps, as she continues to open drawers and place more of her
things into a second suitcase.

&quot;Whatever. I&#39;m going back to bed.&quot; Mike finishes.

&quot;I&#39;m leaving you Mike. This time for good.&quot; Crystal states as she heads
for the open bedroom door, struggling with the heavy suitcases.

&quot;If you say so. You&#39;ll be back. You always do.&quot; Mike laughs as he rolls
over to fall asleep. As Crystal opens the door, Yvette nearly falls
through it and impales a glass through her head if Janice didn&#39;t grab her
fast and relive the glass from her hand.

&quot;Gee, thanks, I.&quot; (Janice lets go and drops her onto the floor).

&quot;Here, let me get that for you.&quot; Janice offers, taking one of the giant
suitcases out of Crystal&#39;s hands and helping her carry her stuff out.

&quot;Sure. Drop me why dontcha.&quot; With a near irritable sigh, Yvette slips
back into the bedroom, but not before her eyes catch Crystal&#39;s on the way
out. She looks Mike&#39;s former spouse up and down. &quot;Yup. You&#39;re her type
alright. Figures.&quot; And, with that, she crawls back into bed with him, her
nipples erect through the see thru lingerie nighty. Yvette smiles at the
entire situation brewing, becoming more aroused at the two women in
Mike&#39;s apartment (though to be honest she had to not think about Janice
as an individual to feel this way). She taps him on the shoulder, craving
more of his manhood.

-----

&#39;Disgusting&#39;, Crystal thinks shaking her head from side to side, as she
turns her attention away from Mike&#39;s lover and towards the living room
and smack dab into Janice. &quot;I&#39;m glad I cart 200-300 lbs psychopaths from
time to time or this&#39;d be murder.&quot; Janice sighs as she notes the suitcase
in her hands. &quot;Anymore and I&#39;d have to call in police backup for the
extraction.&quot; Janice joshed, nudging Crystal out the door with her head as
she waddled out the door like a penguin. &quot;I&#39;m NOT running. wanna survive
the trip down the stairs, thank you very much.&quot;

-----

&quot;Can you believe Mike has that bitch already moved in, living with him
Jan? And that&#39;s not the worst of it, she was actually turned on with you
and me both there.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be a cold day in hell when Vette&#39; actually has a dirty thought
about me. Then again she might do that just to spite me.&quot;

&quot;What kinda weird shit is that?&quot; Crystal asks, as Janice drives the two
to her place, wondering just how she should broach the subject of her and
Yvette&#39;s history.

&quot;I recognize that look.&quot; (sighs) &quot;No. Yvette and I were NEVER lovers.
She&#39;s, for all intents and purposes, my business rival. She&#39;s a part time
wannabe Bounty Hunter and I&#39;ve had her meddle in my business from time to
time fucking things up left and right.&quot; (sighs) &quot;She&#39;s a worst menace on
the streets than the perverts I help arrest.&quot;

&quot;You and Yvette ever had an intimate relationship?&quot;

Janice quickly looks over at Crystal with an askewed expression before
going back to driving. &quot;Man, did she get under your skin back there. And
the answer is still no. Never lovers, never sex partners, never one
timer, never even wet dream material. Never ever.&quot; Janice said with a
sigh at the end.

&quot;Do you find her attractive?&quot;

&quot;Considering the bitch nearly got me killed once during a raid on a snuff
film shoot, I&#39;d like her to be the prettiest piece of meat in the morgue
if I could help it.&quot;

&quot;Does your relationship extend beyond work? How long have you two known
each other?&quot;

&quot;We hate each other, but that wasn&#39;t always so. When I was in High School
I dated her sister-in-law. or was it cousin? Can&#39;t remember, it&#39;s been
years since she died and Yvette hasn&#39;t exactly forgiven me for that.
Still blames me for her death.&quot;

&quot;Is she gonna be a threat to our relationship ala my relationship with
Mike? Is this deja vu all over again? Can I trust you fully?&quot;

Janice pulls the car over and stops, leaning her head against the
steering wheel, a few tears flowing down her face. &quot;I got drunk one
night. And while driving I. goddess. I rammed the car into a tree and
killed my first love! And Yvette hasn&#39;t stopped crucifying me about it
ever since! She-won&#39;t-LEAVE ME ALONE!!&quot; tears flow down more as she
cries. &quot;Ever wonder why I kept a 9mm in my house? When we graduated I got
drunk again because I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about my first love. goddess
I didn&#39;t want to kill her. I didn&#39;t know! When your that age you think
your fucking invincible and nothing can hurt you. then somebody kicks you
in the groin and proves you wrong. That&#39;s what Yvette did to me that
night. That BITCH grabbed me from outside of some bar I was drinking at,
drove me to some empty rental house, tied me up &amp; raped me! She used
everything, INCLUDING THAT GUN ON ME! Worst part is she didn&#39;t do it
while I was drunk. Oh no. she waited. sat there, and waited until I was
sober. then she had fun raping me.&quot; Janice looks up, teeth clenched, as
she stares out the window. &quot;She threw that gun on the bed when she was
done, still fresh with my. and she partially untied one hand. Told me I
was a whore for killing her precious cousin. now I remember, it was her
cousin. and she wanted me to blow my FUCKIN&#39; BRAINS OUT! She wanted me
broken, demoralized, and suicidal. And god help me I almost did it. I
almost fuckin&#39; blew my brains out! If Johnson didn&#39;t arrive on a call
from a neighbor about a break in I would have done it. blew my brains
out.&quot;

Silence. Dead silence.

&quot;I know what your thinking. If she did all that why don&#39;t I kill her?&quot;
(leans back) &quot;Because I promised I wouldn&#39;t! When she was dying in my
arms all she wanted me to do was take care of little Yvette. Keep her
safe. Keep her alive.&quot; (screams) &quot;FUCKIN&#39; HELL TRISHA!! I&#39;VE KEPT MY
PROMISE! EVEN IF I HAD TO SUFFER FOR IT BUT I KEPT MY PROMISE! SO WHY DO
I HAVE TO KEEP SUFFERIN&#39; FOR ONE FUCKIN&#39; MISTAKE?!? WHY???&quot; Janice leans
against her door crying.

&quot;I. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Crystal pulls Janice towards her, hugging her. &quot;I didn&#39;t
know. I&#39;m sorry. so sorry.&quot;

For the longest time neither spoke until finally all the tears were wept
and all the comforting words said. Then, finally, Crystal looked into
Janice&#39;s eyes and asked one final time, to ease the last of her
suspicions. &quot;Are you in love with Yvette?&quot;

&quot;Noooo..&quot; Janice whimpered, looking misty eyed, her face red from crying.
&quot;Yvette&#39;s like a little sister to me now. (And sex between us would be
like incest even if we didn&#39;t hate each other to death). I couldn&#39;t be in
love with her. And if I was? Then why didn&#39;t I save her from Mike instead
of you? No. I love you. Only you. Please don&#39;t do this to me.&quot; (leans
head against Crystal&#39;s shoulder) &quot;I don&#39;t know what I could say to prove
my love, but I.&quot; (sighs) &quot;I put the 9mm back together while you were
gone. I.&quot; (takes a deep breath as she leans back to look into Crystal&#39;s
eyes) &quot;I was so certain Mike was going to steal you away from me I wanted
to blow my brains out. I just wanted to die if I couldn&#39;t be with you.&quot;
(smiles weakly) &quot;If I really wanted Yvette I would have been happy, but
all I wanted to do was die over and over again. I couldn&#39;t get the
thought of killing myself out of my head. But I kept reminding myself
that you gave me one last chance, and that maybe we could still have our
happily ever after ending. if only for that last chance I kept myself
from killing myself. If only for the chance that we&#39;d be together.
forever.&quot; Janice quickly leans forward and kisses Crystal with the same
driving passions in her now, a tear trickling down her cheek as she does
so.

&quot;Please. let&#39;s go home. and never look back. Ever.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. forgive me.&quot; Crystal nods her head, and hugs Janice for the
longest time before they were back on the road again heading for their
home. On the ride home Crystal rested her head as close to Janice&#39;s body
as she could without interfering with her driving, and whispered softly
her love for Janice. Feeling her heart growing warm again after chilling
it with her own doubts, and knowing they were meant to be.

They were going home, their home, now and forever.

&quot;One question. Why are you two so cordial when you meet?&quot;

&quot;Beats the hell out of exchanging gunfire and threats every time we
meet.&quot;

&quot;.oh.&quot;

-----

The car finally pulls into the parking lot of Janice (and now Crystal&#39;s)
home.

Janice smiles as she lifts one bag out of the car. &quot;Let&#39;s ditch these
upstairs and hit the malls afterwards!&quot; (starts lugging suitcases to her
apartment building&#39;s elevator) &quot;Figure it&#39;s my treat so let&#39;s get you
some sporty clothes, some casual clothes, some fancy dinner out clothes.&quot;
(taps button as she enters, setting bag down as elevator goes into
motion) &quot;Some skimpy little shirts and thongs for around the apartment. a
few pieces from Victoria&#39;s Secret.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Knew I memorized their
website for a good reason.&quot;

Crystal leans forward and kisses the last of the tear marks away, making
Janice sigh as she did. &quot;.thank you.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot; she whispers back, leaning briefly against her new love.

As the elevator stops the two cart the huge bags into Janice&#39;s nearby
apartment. &quot;At least the parasites were tidy this morning, I&#39;d give them
that.&quot; (puts bag down) &quot;Going to have to not sleep on my own living room
floor for a month. The scents of their lovemaking could drive any
liberated woman insane (like they&#39;d actually not experiment while I was
out of the room).&quot;

&quot;Think this is the start of something?&quot;

&quot;God I hope so. If they&#39;re going to have an orgy in my living room at
least turn bisexual afterwards if not lesbian and.&quot; (blushes) &quot;.and
that&#39;s not what you meant.&quot; (hugs Crystal) &quot;That start was two years ago.
This is the end of our first chapter. no Mike, no Yvette (kid sisters are
such a pain in the ass anyway, how can people standing having little
siblings), and the start of many more to come. I promise.&quot;

&quot;I know. And I couldn&#39;t be happier.&quot; Crystal looks into Janice&#39;s eyes,
and the two kiss slowly and softly, shivering as their lips pressed
close, holding each other tight as their kiss lingered, joining each in a
bond that was now complete. &quot;Together forever.&quot;

&quot;So.&quot; Crystal smiled, quickly changing the subject as she leaned back.
&quot;When is Johnson taking us to dinner to meet his wife?&quot;

&quot;How did. oh, right, he brought you here last night. Figures.&quot;

Crystal hugs Janice again as she slumps her head. &quot;I give up. I&#39;ll call
him and tell him we&#39;ll have dinner tonight. Meet the wife and let them
grill us.&quot;

&quot;Think I can live with that.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Janice&#39;s sigh is cut short by another kiss.

&quot;What&#39;ll I ever do with you, my good deeds doing snuggle bunny.&quot;

&quot;Talk me out of dinner before I make that call.?&quot; (looks into Crystal&#39;s
eyes) &quot;Guess not. Alright.&quot; (pulls away reluctantly) &quot;I&#39;ll call.&quot;

&quot;Fine. I&#39;ll be getting a change of clothes and taking a shower before we
go shopping.&quot; (Janice picks up the phone) &quot;With the door unlocked, and my
favorite strap on lying on the bed.&quot;

Janice couldn&#39;t call fast enough.
