<h1>All Girls School (part 106 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch105.html">Back to Part 105</a><pre>&quot;Ambiguity Gray&quot;

When Janine woke up late the next morning, she sighed and rolled over, 
expecting to see May lying next to her, naked and happy and so 
beautiful. But nothing was there except emptiness: abandoned sheets and 
covers, and a cool pillow. A stab of sadness pierced through Janine&#39;s 
tender skin, and she wondered if something she had done, something she 
had said, forced her newly-beloved May to abandon here there in that 
bed&#151;or worse, that the whole thing had been a miraculous dream. Janine 
sighed wearily and rested back on her side of the bed. Their lovemaking 
had felt so real... How could it have been a dream?

As if things weren&#39;t confusing enough, a loud blare from some distant 
radio shook her out of her sleepiness. It was a classic rock song from 
the eighties, and Janine smiled as she recognized it. May told her it 
was one of her favorite songs; perhaps she was still here and had merely 
woken up earlier! Despite not wearing anything save the sheets, Janine 
couldn&#39;t help but sit up and boogie to the song.
One foot on the brake and one on the gas

As the lyrics roared out, who else but May Tramble appeared from the 
bathroom, wearing a T-shirt and blue panties a size too small, 
effectively accentuating her waist and bottom. The older woman was 
singing to the lyrics and&#151;more interestingly&#151;dancing along with them.
Well, there&#39;s too much traffic, I can&#39;t pass, no

The woman completely broke Janine&#39;s opinion of her and swerved her hips 
around like a stripper, slowly coming over to show off her sensuality to 
Janine, who laughed and soaked up the whole show. She never pegged May 
as the type who would do something so wild, so it was definitely 
exciting. And, frankly, a serious turn-on.

So I tried my best illegal move
Well, baby, black and white come and touched my groove again

And now, the woman was directly in front of Janine, shaking her rear end 
and caressing her body in an openly sexual dance. Bautista loved every 
minute of it.

Go on and write me up for 125

Post my face wanted dead or alive

Take my license, all that jive

I can&#39;t drive 55!

Janine cheered for her sweetheart as she finally stopped dancing. She 
leaped out of bed, totally in the nude, and gave the wild woman a hug. 
They laughed for a good while before May excused herself to turn the 
radio off. Janine yawned and stretched, not caring that she was as bare 
as the day she was born, or that May was nearly in that same state of 
undress.

&quot;That was wild!&quot; she exclaimed across the room. &quot;I never expected you&#39;d 
do something like that. So little Miss Tramble has a crazy streak too.&quot;

&quot;What can I say?&quot; her voice called back. &quot;I just felt like rocking 
today. I feel really sexy now.&quot;

&quot;You are sexy,&quot; Janine purred, walking up to her beloved once she came 
back. This time their embrace was openly sensual, mouths and hands 
groping passionately. They grinned at each other, so happy now that 
their relationship was turning out like this...and then Janine went in 
for the kill.

&quot;Hey...wanna take a shower together?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; said an excited May. Janine glared at her lustfully and 
squeezed her bottom.

&quot;Well, don&#39;t you think you&#39;re a little overdressed, sweetheart?&quot;

&quot;I guess,&quot; came the husky reply. May&#39;s hands were already rubbing 
Janine&#39;s breasts; the sexual need between them was apparent even now, 
not long after their first (and second, and third, and...) moment of 
passion. &quot;Maybe you could...help out with that?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; she giggled, already lifting the older woman&#39;s shirt off. 
She knelt down to kiss her belly, dipping her tongue into May&#39;s soft 
navel, petting the girl&#39;s soft behind with wanting. The underwear seemed 
an afterthought until Janine kissed the crotch, pulled it down, and 
stood up to take her beloved into her arms. Squealing and laughing, they 
raced to the bathroom, dove into the cramped shower, and blasted the 
water until it was just right.

&quot;I need you,&quot; May hissed, embracing Janine from behind. &quot;I need to feel 
your soft bare chest so badly. I want to touch your every area. I want 
to squeeze and fondle your breasts.&quot; (All the time she was saying this, 
she was of course doing it as well) &quot;I want to softly rub my fingers 
around your pink nipples. I want to lather your skin, caress your 
sensual soapy breasts, and lick the soap off your nipples with my 
tongue.&quot; She ground her crotch into Janine&#39;s bottom, digging her hips 
and waist in as far as they would go; her breasts crushed into Janine&#39;s 
back; her hands working magic with the woman&#39;s bosom.

&quot;Uhh...May...May, my darling, my sweet...&quot; It felt so fantastic to 
actually be doing this, to whisper sensually and to touch one another&#39;s 
bodies with lust and not fear&#151;to look at each other amidst a spray and a 
mist, to smile, to rub noses (and subsequently breasts), to kiss 
tenderly until all was lost in a wonderful display of romantic chaos. 
Janine needed to have May&#39;s breasts; she needed to feel what it was like 
to actually perform sexual favors for another woman. She wanted to do 
it, she wanted to put her feminine hands on May&#39;s feminine hips, her 
girlish lips and tongue over those girlish nipples, her mouth over May&#39;s 
fuzzy womanhood. She wanted to make love to May, to penetrate her, to 
lick and kiss every part of her goddess&#39; body.

And she wanted to be taken, to be dominated, to be loved by this beauty 
whom she had secretly pined for, and denied, and loved for so long. She 
wanted to feel May&#39;s fingers inside her vagina, fucking her so sweetly 
as she called her name&#151;&quot;Janine, Janine!&quot; She wanted to feel May&#39;s hands 
on her bottom, squeezing and caressing with the utmost need. She wanted 
May to kiss her, to touch her, to go inside of her and share her soul. 
Mostly, she wanted to...she needed to...she had to...

&quot;AAHH! MAAYYY! I&#39;m going to...I&#39;m going to...&quot;

&quot;Say it, honey!&quot; Janine blushed. Never, even in her wildest fantasies, 
had she ever...

&quot;I&#39;m going to come!!&quot; And then it hit her, that indescribable wave of 
everything, that shard of Heaven glimpsed just briefly, the moment where 
reality and fantasy merge, that thing mortals crudely called an orgasm 
and the universe reverberated with. It was Life, and Janine was Living 
right in May&#39;s mouth.

&quot;God,&quot; she murmured when coherence finally came back to her, &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe I came in your mouth. That&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;d read about 
in a sex story.&quot;

&quot;Well, we are having sex,&quot; May reminded her, reaching up to tweak one of 
those cute nipples. Janine squealed and smiled cutely. &quot;Oral sex, 
perhaps, but sex nonetheless.&quot;

&quot;I wanna do it too,&quot; Janine whispered. They were still in the shower, 
but aside from a few innuendos here and there, they had entirely 
forgotten about cleaning up. After recovering her breath and stamina, 
Janine and May switched places, one lying down on the surface, a bit 
awkwardly, and the other kneeling before her beloved, ready to fly her 
to the moon. Janine had never tasted another woman&#39;s sex 
before&#151;penetrated and touched, of course, but never with her mouth. Not 
until now, anyway. She didn&#39;t hold back at all, though&#151;she wanted to do 
this, for herself and for May. She wanted to give May oral pleasure, 
more than anything. Well...that and a few other things.

Since May was already &quot;hot to trot&quot;, as she said, it didn&#39;t take her 
nearly as long to reach an orgasm. Janine had no immediate opinion 
regarding the older woman&#39;s vaginal secretions, save it was a flavor 
that was now meant for her alone. After shakily rising to their feet and 
giving each other a deep, loving embrace, they turned off the water and 
dried each other off, both of them sharing one big towel.

They went back to the bed, naked and holding hands, and laid down to 
stare at the ceiling and contemplate everything that had happened. There 
was no point in keeping secrets or thoughts to themselves; the girls 
needed to express it verbally. It&#39;s not often when one admits to the 
feelings one has for one&#39;s close friend, and then acts upon them soon 
after. After gazing at the white ceiling, squeezing and rubbing each 
other&#39;s hands and fingers, May opened up first.

&quot;So what do you think of this?&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s great,&quot; said Janine. She turned to face May, smiling at 
the miracle lying next to her. She had never met a woman who could be 
adorably cute, wonderfully pretty, and downright sexy all at once, but 
somehow, this goddess pulled it off. She found herself staring at 
May&#151;not just her naughty bits, but every part of her&#151;and knew now, for a 
fact, she was irresistibly attracted to her. &quot;You?&quot;

&quot;I say it&#39;s about time we stopped fooling around,&quot; she said with a grin. 
&quot;I mean...dancing around the subject wasn&#39;t helping us out at all. And 
now look at us. We&#39;re both so happy. I know I shouldn&#39;t speak for you, 
but it&#39;s hard to argue with that big smile on your face.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, really.&quot; Janine&#39;s hand trailed up May&#39;s bare arm, resting on her 
shoulder. &quot;I am happy, I really am. And I&#39;m sorry, sorry for being so 
stubborn about it. I think ever since I first kissed you, I&#39;ve felt 
drawn to you, but it took awhile for me to really realize it. You know 
me; I can make a mule look willing.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; May leaned over, caressing Janine&#39;s face, and gave her a tender 
kiss. And another. And another. They grinned at each other&#151;this was so 
refreshing and exciting! It was like every touch, every look, even every 
single moment was a new discovery! Perhaps this was &quot;love&quot;, but they 
didn&#39;t want to jinx everything and bring out the big L-word. Not yet. 
May kissed her again, sliding her tongue inside effortlessly, and 
squealed softly as Janine sucked it in greedily.

&quot;I want you,&quot; managed the older woman, slowly pushing her beloved onto 
the bed. &quot;I wanna ravish you right now. I need to make love to you.&quot; 
Janine blushed a happy shade of red, exploding with joy and love. May 
really felt the same way!

&quot;I&#39;m all yours, sweetheart,&quot; she whispered, her eyes a little misty. &quot;I 
want you too. I want you to take me, to make me, to ravish me, to...love 
me. Fuck me, May. Please, May, fuck me, please.&quot; The words came out so 
breathlessly and beautifully that May choked up and cried a little. That 
word was vulgar and obscene to her ears, but when Janine said it, nearly 
begging her, it was so gorgeous and perfect...

She cried out her name and caressed her face with passion before locking 
their lips together. They embraced; May rubbed her breasts and nipples 
into the younger woman&#39;s bosom, feeling the slippery electric mix of 
sweet sufferable pain and outstanding joy the friction caused. Her 
fingers trailed south, so smoothly touching and fondling Janine&#39;s tan 
skin, sometimes pinching it gently. She touched Bautista&#39;s nerve, 
tickled her thick pubic hair, fingers poised to dive. The look that May 
gave her was utter uncontrollable lust, nothing else.

&quot;No,&quot; whispered Janine. &quot;The other way. I want us to rub our vaginas 
together. That&#39;s how I want you to fuck me.&quot; May could tell she was 
nervous; she spoke with such a quivering voice! But Janine knew what she 
wanted, and even though she was on the bottom, Miss Bautista was clearly 
in command. Since both women had genitals that went in and not out, it 
was difficult trying to figure out just how this was going to work. May 
wanted to, naturally&#151;anything for Janine, now&#151;she just...it was so...um, 
maybe that&#151;no, turn it around here...or over&#151;wait, okay, put it back 
that...well, it was better here&#151;no, you got it&#151;wait, um...okay, um...oh. 
...Oh. Oh.

Perfect.

Good thing Janine didn&#39;t take her friends on their offer to share one 
big room. The cries of bliss and perfection they made would&#39;ve stirred a 
deaf man.

.........

Afterglow. It was a fitting word. After laying there on the bed, &quot;airing 
out&quot; from the hot wild sex, Janine and May stood on wobbly legs and 
cleaned themselves up with some moist rags. They decided it&#39;d be better 
to get out of the hotel room soon, before they had to pay for another 
night&#39;s stay, and besides, they couldn&#39;t stay in all day having sex like 
newlyweds. They agreed to go on a date&#151;not as friends or buddies, but a 
real actual official romantic date, with all titles, implications, and 
benefits.

&quot;So are we really girlfriends now?&quot; May asked as they walked outside, 
holding hands shamelessly. Janine grinned shyly.

&quot;Yeah...I&#39;d like that. I don&#39;t know how people go about the business of 
making it official or anything...&quot;

&quot;We could just kiss on it,&quot; suggested May. Janine chuckled&#151;they had done 
far more than kissing that day and the last&#151;but it was a sweet idea, and 
so they did, right in broad daylight. &quot;Wow,&quot; said May, caressing her new 
girlfriend&#39;s black hair, &quot;I actually have a girlfriend. I have a 
girlfriend. And it&#39;s you. I&#39;m so glad!&quot;

&quot;Me too!&quot; replied Janine, grinning broadly. They embraced and kissed 
again, but came to their senses before it was too late. There would be 
plenty of time for physical intimacy later: now, they needed to go on 
that date.

&quot;So where to? You got any ideas?&quot;

&quot;No, not really. I can&#39;t afford much. Prom wiped me out.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, but it was worth it.&quot; They exchanged a sweet smile and squeezed 
hands.

&quot;Yeah, definitely. Boy, if Blake and the others catch wind of this, 
we&#39;ll never hear the end of it!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. They never once stopped bugging us&#151;but here we are, 
together as prophesized. Who do you think we have to thank the most for 
it, Miss Post or Miss Madsen?&quot;

&quot;Well, Madsen brought us together as friends, but Post brought us 
together as...this. I&#39;ll give props to Ellie.&quot; May agreed and embraced 
Janine suddenly, taking her into gentle arms.

&quot;We have them both to thank. And you know, we have to tell those girls 
sometime. I don&#39;t want to hide the fact that we&#39;re a couple, not from 
anyone.&quot; Janine became flushed, smiled warmly, and kissed May&#39;s face.

&quot;I-I&#39;m glad. I don&#39;t want to hide either. ...But let&#39;s not tell them 
just yet. I&#39;m not quite ready. Maybe we can let Olivia in on it first. 
She&#39;s usually not the gossipmonger the others are. Chances are she&#39;ll 
just roll her eyes and give us that I-told-you-so smile.&quot;

&quot;And after her?&quot; Janine had to think about it first. Not Victoria; the 
young lady would blurt it out like she did with everything else. 
Definitely not Gabrielle&#151;otherwise, they really never would hear the end 
of it. Blake was a wild card: would she be too doped up on her 
medications to care, or would that wild side come into play and expose 
the whole thing? And what about June?

&quot;Your sister,&quot; Janine said. &quot;I feel I could trust her.&quot;

&quot;I hope so; she&#39;s my twin.&quot; They smiled and continued their walk. The 
day was nice, but it would probably rain soon, just in time for finals. 
Terrific, just one more thing to worry about. Well, as much as they 
dreaded taking those last tests, it was really just another part of 
life. That was the way of things: everything needed a conclusion before 
something else could begin.

&quot;And after that,&quot; Janine sighed, &quot;well...we&#39;ll see what happens. 
Whatever may come of it, I just want you to know that I&#39;ll be right 
here, with you.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah,&quot; May whispered. She wanted to sound romantic too, but there 
was one thing tickling the back of her mind, something that could 
potentially split apart this new, wonderful relationship that had been 
so long in the making. It was not a creation of others, something cruel, 
hard, sadistic, and thirsty to see true love broken&#151;no, it was a desire, 
a will of another person, the need to climb higher steps, reach loftier 
goals, and look at broader horizons.

In other words, college.

But they could worry about that later. After all, they had the whole day 
to themselves.

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
Daughter of Elysium,
We enter fire imbibed,
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.

Thy magic reunites those
Whom stern custom has parted;
All men will become brothers
Under thy gentle wing.

May he who has had the fortune
To gain a true friend
And he who has won a noble wife
Join in our jubilation!

Yes, even if he calls but one soul
His own in all the world.
But he who has failed in this
Must steal away alone and in tears.

All the world&#39;s creatures
Draw joy from nature&#39;s breast;
Both the good and the evil
Follow her rose-strewn path.

She gave us kisses and wine
And a friend loyal unto death;
She gave lust for life to the lowliest,
And the Cherub stands before God.

Joyously, as his suns speed
Through Heaven&#39;s glorious order,
Hasten, Brothers, on your way,
Exulting as a knight in victory.

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
Daughter of Elysium,
We enter fire imbibed,
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss for all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
A loving father must dwell.

Can you sense the Creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy.
Above the stars He must dwell.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss for all the world!
Brother!, above the starry canopy
A loving father must dwell.

Can you sense the Creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy.
Above the stars He must dwell.

Joy, beautiful spark of the gods,
Daughter of Elysium,
We enter fire imbibed,
Heavenly, thy sanctuary.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss for all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
A loving father must dwell.

Can you sense the Creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy.
Above the stars He must dwell.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss for all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
A loving father must dwell.

Can you sense the Creator, world?
Seek him above the starry canopy.
Above the stars He must dwell.

Joy, daughter of Elysium
Thy magic reunites those
Whom stern custom has parted;
All men will become brothers
Under thy gentle wing.

Be embraced, Millions!
This kiss for all the world!
Brothers, above the starry canopy
A loving father must dwell.

Joy, beautiful spark of Gods!
Daughter of Elysium,
Joy, beautiful spark of Gods!
