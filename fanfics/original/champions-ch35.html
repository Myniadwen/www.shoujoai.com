Rin was busy muttering something about how weird Snowblood had been as 
of late, which meant that Kailin was tuning her out as usual. She was 
much more interested in Kathy, the Guardian Angel, their accompanying 
guide in this awful quest that Kissa had sent them on. She made things 
easier with her presence, her gentle smile and demeanor, her patience, 
and her tenderness. Kailin had grown up not knowing much love; her 
parents were long gone (she had to wonder why she never met them while 
she was dead), Marissa was pretty much a no-show, and Rin was hardly the 
type to dote. Yet Kathy, the Angel...

Kailin tried getting the young lady to open up more, reveal more about 
herself. The trio spent several nights together after the debacle at 
Rin&#39;s house, and each night bore little fruit. Angel usually stared into 
the campfire that Kailin made&#151;for, as she said, &quot;when you look into the 
flame, the flame will look back at you.&quot; She said and did many strange 
things, but she wasn&#39;t bad. Kailin liked her a whole lot&#151;and so did 
BaoBao! That was a plus. The poor panda had only seemed drawn towards 
young Hsu, but apparently there was something about Kathy she liked as 
well. The two of them looked so cute when they played together (and Rin, 
grunting in exasperation, wondering why she never got that attention)!

One night, Kathy did say something about herself: she had no family to 
speak of. Her mother was dead, her father gone missing. That was all she 
said. Kailin drew close and draped an arm of support over her new 
friend&#39;s shoulder&#151;she knew what it was like to lose family. Her own 
parents had been gunned down because they wanted to protect her, but 
even that heroic act had failed, although in retrospect, she did turn 
out fairly all right.

&quot;I was able to dole out vengeance,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;It felt good. I 
found out even I was able to kill. Those people deserved to die for what 
they did. What about you?&quot; Angel nodded.

&quot;Yes. I had vengeance as well. But I only enjoyed it once. I wasn&#39;t able 
to kill the people who murdered my mother. They died by another means.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Sanaa,&quot; she said. &quot;That is my only clue.&quot; The name somehow rang a 
familiar bell in Hsu&#39;s head, but she just couldn&#39;t place it...

&quot;Did you say &#39;Sanaa&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yes, why?&quot; Kailin drew her legs in, studying the dancing fire she had 
made.

&quot;No reason. Just thought I knew the name from somewhere, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;...Oh.&quot;

......

Kailin smiled warmly as she woke up: the angelic face of Kathryn O&#39;Hare 
was laying right next to her on the pillow they shared. She yearned to 
reach out, touch the milky skin, sift through hair so black&#151;her fingers 
danced, tickling until Kathy stirred and smiled back. They laid there 
for awhile, simply exchanging happy looks, until Rin, yawning like a 
lioness, sat up and groaned about how hungry she was. Hsu sighed.

&quot;Oh well. Another morning started in the life of us Ronin.&quot;

Once the quartet ate breakfast (BaoBao happily munching on bamboo, 
nestled comfortably in Kathy&#39;s lap), they set out on the road again, Rin 
breaking the sweet harmony between the two younger girls by demanding, 
&quot;Just where the hell are we anyway?&quot;

&quot;No idea.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got good eyes, Kath! Tell us where we are! We anywhere near a 
place that actually has a bed?&quot;

&quot;Be patient,&quot; sighed the poor angel. Kailin stepped back and watched in 
awe as her friend started to glow. Her eyes unfolded, and she scanned 
the horizon further than any normal person ever could. After awhile she 
reverted, looking drained. &quot;It&#39;s not very far off. We can reach there by 
this time tomorrow. It&#39;s a large complex, located at the outskirts of a 
city. We should arrive at its back before long.&quot;

&quot;So we hit the building first and then the city?&quot;

&quot;That is the direction we seem to be taking.&quot; Rin swatted at the air.

&quot;Cool. Well, hop to it, girls. I can&#39;t carry you both on my back, and I 
know you can&#39;t keep up with me at full speed.&quot;

&quot;What about that bike you had?&quot; Rin snarled.

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember, Hsu?! I lost it when we died! Hello!&quot;

&quot;You what?&quot; Angel gasped in surprise and stared at the two girls as if 
she had seen, well, ghosts. Rin turned ashen as she realized what kind 
of cat she had just let out of the bag; Kailin grimaced awfully. Angel 
was transfixed in her confusion until she realized something: these two 
girls were now Kissa&#39;s servants, much like she was. Of course they 
would&#39;ve dealt with death in some form&#151;why else would Kissa even be 
involved? She calmed down and managed to smile sadly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;m sorry, I forgot our mutual friend&#39;s role in this. I 
think I understand the two of you a bit better now. It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re 
not the first friends of mine who&#39;ve died...just the first to come 
back.&quot; Angel became uncomfortably quiet, and walked off by herself. Rin 
was still stuttering, trying to explain; Kailin pursued her friend, kept 
her company, spoke to her in quiet whispers. Eventually Rin followed 
them, but she knew she couldn&#39;t get away with not explaining a few 
things first.

Meanwhile, fifty miles back, a calamity was gaining.

Night came, and while Angel assured her friends that they were very 
close, she also assured them that she was very sleepy. Rin vaguely noted 
that Kathy and Kailin cuddled up close together (with BaoBao); her mind 
was on other things. She mainly wanted to do something about Snowblood&#39;s 
daughter, but according to that &quot;crazy blind woman&quot;, it would be an 
impossible feat, even for her. And yet if Rin didn&#39;t do something, she 
believed, somebody would definitely die&#151;probably her! Of course, the 
threat of death no longer held sway over her, but still!

When they all woke up, Rin wasn&#39;t the only one who complained. Kailin 
badly wanted to take a bath, and even BaoBao seemed to agree with her. 
Rin sighed&#151;she figured their destination would have a good washroom&#151;but 
she was outnumbered, and so it fell upon her to seek out a substitute. 
Meanwhile, Angel told Kailin another nugget of history: she was later 
sold into an abusive family. Rin came back before long, too ecstatic for 
that early hour, and explained (or bellowed) that they were close to a 
pond that had a magnificent view of some mountains and the city they 
were approaching. It sounded like a go, so the group headed off.

Rin hollered madly as she shirked her clothes and jumped in&#151;and then 
screamed violently, &quot;IT&#39;S FREAKING FREEZING!!!&quot; Kailin and Angel 
laughed, then noticed each other undressing and blushed. Kailin politely 
looked away, and even in the presence of other women, was shy about her 
body. Angel&#39;s was compact, beautifully pale, and soft as melted butter. 
She smiled with just a slight hint of wanting as she looked at Kailin&#39;s 
naked back, and blushed as the girl turned around and smiled back.

The three girls didn&#39;t really bathe so much as they played. After Kailin 
sent a fireball into the water (improving its temperature considerably), 
she and Angel held hands and walked in. It was still cold, but enjoyably 
so, and soon they got used to it and started splashing each other and 
laughing. Rin felt left out as she watched them frolic, but perhaps that 
was a good thing. Kailin needed to be around girls her age anyway, and 
Angel seemed good for her. The fight ended with Rin dunking them both; 
they only took a few minutes to seriously bathe (the younger ones gladly 
washed each others&#39; hair). After that, back to the road, one step closer 
to their destination.

The Ronin didn&#39;t know it, but they were heading straight towards 
MERCS&#151;and trouble.

......

Joyce didn&#39;t like her roommates. Alisti was frightening, and cursed at 
her violently with loud, painful shrieks, and even though Skye was the 
complete opposite, the way she looked at Joyce ran shivers down the 
girl&#39;s spine. She found every excuse possible to avoid them, along with 
anyone else she could sneak away from. Most of the new faces ignored 
her, thankfully, but a few were just a little too gregarious. Lurker, 
that ugly monster with a heart of gold, popped by her area to say hello, 
but her mere presence made poor Joyce whimper. G-Force was kind, but 
soon she would learn to fear young Joyce, as would Thunder-Claw, the 
Spoon Man, Siren, everyone.

She found some measure of respite alone, in the small garden Yui had 
given her. Nobody would bother her there, nobody would look at her in 
fear or hatred. She could truly be herself, she and that bear. Only one 
other person could go to that garden aside from Miss Miyamoto: Aura 
Valeria, the only person Joyce considered a friend. Aura was off meeting 
all the new faces, spreading her friendly smile and with it, good 
fortunes. The gang would need it, for a terrible storm was brewing.

As everyone got settled in and grew accustomed to their new roommates, 
the two Ronin and their guide finally arrived at the front door of 
MERCS. Rin crossed her arms and looked up at the large building, 
surprised to find such an establishment after what they had been 
through. Not bothering to knock, they let themselves in and greeted the 
weary receptionist with a wave. It was at that moment, not three minutes 
after they stepped inside, that an alarm went off, loud and chaotic. The 
girls covered their ears reflexively and shouted&#151;&quot;What the heck&#39;s going 
on!?&quot; In moments, they had their answer. Dr. Kamaguchi came running down 
a flight of stairs, disheveled and bleary, and glanced at the trio 
briefly.

&quot;What are visitors doing here now? Kason, we have a crisis on our hands. 
Warn our employees and residents to stay in their rooms until further 
notice. Who are you three?&quot; The Ronin identified themselves, then asked 
their question again. Kamaguchi&#39;s lip twisted; &quot;The alarm means what you 
think it means, ladies. This foundation is under attack. Our 
surveillance must&#39;ve picked up a large number of hostiles.&quot;

&quot;How would you know they&#39;re hostile?&quot; The receptionist gave Kamaguchi a 
readout, which she displayed to the trio.

&quot;Because surveillance picked up a large force, all of them armed well, 
and they&#39;re heading in our direction. For your safety, ladies, I&#39;ll have 
to ask you to follow my assistant.&quot;

&quot;Whoa, waitasec! We&#39;re not just gonna sit by when there&#39;s trouble! Just 
show us where the enemy is and let us do the thrashing!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s not an option. I&#39;d rather not have any bloodshed. 
Excuse me!&quot; Kamaguchi rushed past them and burst outside, where she was 
confronted with the largest assembly of hostile forces she had ever 
seen. Most of them were men in red samurai armor, riding atop horses, 
but others (she noted with a start) were animals, ranging from badgers 
to elephants, and even a large bird above. Three people were in the 
lead; these she spoke to.

&quot;STOP!!!&quot; she cried, waving her hands. &quot;What is the meaning of this? Why 
are you all here? Who is in charge?&quot;

&quot;I am, wench!&quot; shouted one of the armored men. He wore green instead, 
and his sword was much more wicked-looking than all the others. The two 
standing beside him cleared their throats, and with a groan, he added, 
&quot;The three of us are. I am Sashuo; this is Yan and Valmont. We have come 
to claim the life of Rin Takamatsu!&quot; Of course, Kamaguchi recognized 
this name at once, having been recently introduced to the girl. She 
turned pale and tried talking her way out of more trouble.

&quot;This assembly is a bit excessive for just one girl.&quot; Sashuo leered.

&quot;I am known for my drastic measures. This army and these two men you see 
are for added strength. Just in case we run into unexpected opposition.&quot; 
Kamaguchi chewed her lip nervously, but she had a wild card. She 
secretly slipped her hand into her lab coat pocket and activated a small 
remote control that would alert all her employees of danger. That was 
their signal&#151;they would come swarming out and defend her, and MERCS, 
according to their contracts.

&quot;What makes you think this Rin girl is here?&quot;

&quot;The look of fear on your face is evidence enough!&quot; he spat. He then 
gestured to Valmont, the youngest and smallest of the three, who smiled 
in a childish manner.

&quot;But even if you had a good poker face, my friends here are natural 
hunters. We caught Rin&#39;s scent easily, and followed her here. You could 
say that the wind was in our favor.&quot;

&quot;I am so sick of that pun!&quot; snorted the one called Yan. He stared at 
Kamaguchi loathingly, adding with a cruel smile, &quot;So are you gonna bring 
her out or not? Because I&#39;ve been known for my destructive habits. It 
wouldn&#39;t do to have a tornado bring itself down on your pitiful little 
place, now would it?&quot; Kamaguchi turned green with illness, but relief 
came soon. Everyone under her employment, including the new faces, 
streamed out of the front door and assembled between her and the 
enemies. Yan and Valmont looked surprised at the turnout, but Sashuo 
didn&#39;t seem fazed.

&quot;I thought so! You think such a small number can stop us? I have mowed 
down thrice this number on my own! Bring Rin Takamatsu if she is in this 
group! My comrades are more than sufficient to destroy the others!&quot; The 
MERCS didn&#39;t care for being thought of as so weak, but the army kept 
them busy enough. Rin, having been one of the first out the door, glared 
at Sashuo as he called her out, and leaped forth to meet his challenge. 
Through his grotesque samurai mask, he smiled as he faced his prey at 
long last.

&quot;Ah, so you are Rin! You look like your parents. A pity they survived 
that attack the other day!&quot;

&quot;Humph, so you were responsible. That figures. Just who are you guys, 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;No point in hiding, now that you&#39;ll soon die,&quot; he growled. &quot;We are the 
Crimson Blades, feared agents of havoc, and I am Sashuo, one of the Dead 
Zodiac! Draw your sword!&quot; Rin scowled as she heard his name&#151;so this was 
the man Snowblood had been forced to work for!&#151;and unsheathed her sword, 
the special one her father had made. Sashuo did not bother to show his 
surprise.

&quot;That blade...! It is indeed Takamatsu&#39;s! A fine sword like that does 
not belong in your filthy hands! Give it to me, now!&quot;

&quot;You can have it when you pry it from my cold dead fingers!&quot; shouted 
Rin. Maybe not the best choice of words&#151;Sashuo probably had that in mind 
all along. Regardless, they crashed against each other, but Rin was 
surprised at the man&#39;s strength. She was giving it everything she had, 
but he was fighting back without any effort at all! His sword alone 
looked capable of slicing diamonds in half; the sheer ferocity of his 
attack drove even her back, and for the first time in ages, Rin feared 
for her life.

Most of the members of MERCS were kept busy with Sashuo&#39;s troop, but a 
few had broken off to battle the two leaders, Yan and Valmont. Skye and 
G-Force remembered the willowy Yan well, and leaped into the air to 
battle him on his own terms (Skye had to transform into her 
dragon-self). He laughed at their advance and threw a mighty gust at 
them, sending them back to the ground.

&quot;O, tornado! Rend my stupid enemies apart, bit by bit! But spare the 
men; I want some prisoners of war!&quot; He laughed as a great spiraling 
cyclone emitted from the calm air, twisting and turning with incredible 
violence. Not even the strongest person could weather such a storm; even 
Merry, donning her thickest armor, was swept up and away. Alisti tried 
to blast him, but she was thrown off balance; Thunder-Claw couldn&#39;t even 
get a single shot off; the poor Spoon Man had to cling to a tree to keep 
from being lost.

&quot;I&#39;ll take care of this!&quot; shouted Xianq. She shot a pink smokescreen 
into the air, called for G-Force to help lift her up, and jumped as high 
as she could. She vaulted all the way to Yan&#39;s level, grinned, and 
covered him with pink goo. He cursed and struggled, but the stuff was 
strong.

&quot;You bitch! You think this can stop me?! That tornado will only get 
worse if I can&#39;t command it!&quot;

&quot;So scream at it or something; what do I care?&quot; Yan grinned maliciously, 
watching with glee as Bubblegum Black was suddenly covered by a swarm of 
bees and birds. He was freed from his prison by a swarm of locusts 
courtesy of Valmont, and shot out after Black. He came right up to her, 
grabbed her by the throat, smacked his forehead against hers, and sent 
her crashing to the ground with a powerful crushing gust. BK Power 
screamed for her friend and ran to check on her; Siren stayed behind, 
glared up at the laughing man, and focused her energy.

&quot;Let&#39;s see if you like a dose of my spirit wave!&quot; The woman thrust her 
hand out, shooting a wide swath of energy borne from pure rage. It got 
sucked up into the tornado, and whirled out of control until it 
destroyed the cyclone. Rays of spirit power shot out like meteors as it 
exploded, pocking the ground, several Crimson Blades and animals, and 
even a few allies (poor Lurker got hit in the arm and wailed). Yan was 
thrown back from the explosion, and had to twist his body through the 
air to avoid the shooting rays.

&quot;Over here!&quot; He yelled in surprise as a voice challenged him, and gawked 
as he saw G-Force hovering next to him. There was no time to act; she 
kicked him hard, sending him crashing to the ground, where an enraged BK 
Power tackled him and pinned him to the ground.

&quot;Bastard!&quot; she spat, punching him hard in the jaw. &quot;What did you do to 
Beeg?!&quot; He giggled weakly and blew a wad of saliva and blood at her. 
That was the last straw: with a roar, BK Power clutched onto his head as 
he laughed and pulled with all her might, yanking it clean off with her 
bare hands.

Valmont himself was no match for even the weakest of the MERCS, but his 
own private army, fur and feathers and exoskeleton alike, could make up 
for such shortcomings. Those who weren&#39;t fighting Sashuo&#39;s men or Yan 
were busy with his army: bears surrounded some, elephants chased others, 
and bees stung those who looked like they had some fight in them. Rancor 
and Cobra took the front lines, absorbing as much damage as they could, 
while their friends fought back. Most everyone else was busy with the 
Crimson Blades, except for Pandora, who had been watching everything 
from her room safe inside the building.

&quot;You&#39;re not fighting?&quot; asked Kamaguchi, paying her a visit. Pandora 
smiled.

&quot;No, let them kill each other. The smart predator does not interfere in 
a fight until a survivor is left&#151;then they destroy the weak. Whoever is 
left over...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t change,&quot; said Kamaguchi in amusement. She sighed, content to 
watch as well, and only made comments when she felt it necessary. Back 
in the battle, most of the MERCS were being overwhelmed. The Crimson 
Blades were giving them all a hard time, and Valmont&#39;s army was filling 
in the gaps, suffocating those strong enough to stand a chance. Alisti 
had blacked out three times from using her powers so much, and had to be 
taken away. Skye picked her up and carried her off, caring for her every 
time until she regained consciousness.

By that time, G-Force had witnessed the gruesome spectacle of Yan&#39;s 
beheading, and was frankly sick from it. Being one of the few people not 
currently engaged in a fight, she knew it would be up to her to tip the 
scales. She had already proven herself against Yan; now it was time to 
fight Valmont. As the young boy was occupying himself with his army, she 
hovered in the air, lightened from a lack of gravity, and positioned 
herself directly over the enemy. Swarms of locusts and bats tried 
stopping her, but she blew them all away with an increase or decrease in 
gravity, and sailed on. When she was directly overhead, she threw her 
g-force into reverse, pulling as much of it behind her as she could, 
thus making her descent more like a rocket. With such power behind her, 
she fell through the sky towards Valmont, who only had a second to react 
(by yelling) before she stomped on him, crushing his spine like an 
accordion.

Three seconds later, Sally Redinger realized that, for the first time, 
she had killed someone.

Maybe in a heated battle to preserve her life and the life of her 
friends, yes, but it was a kill nonetheless. She shivered violently from 
the weight of the trauma, and knelt on the ground, stricken with what 
she had done. Her girlfriend saw it, and while she had to admit that 
watching G-Force crush Valmont into the ground was cool, seeing her 
grieve over her first murder was terrible. She ran over to the younger 
girl, picked her up, and embraced her fiercely.

&quot;Now you know how I felt,&quot; she stammered, &quot;each and every time my anger 
caused somebody pain!&quot;

&quot;Oh, Merry...!&quot; The two of them wept, but in war, there was no time for 
tears. They forced themselves to push their emotions aside, and resumed 
the fight, slowly but surely overwhelming the Crimson Blades. Without a 
master to control them, Valmont&#39;s animal army was freed, and each 
wandered off in a daze, not to be seen again. Only Sashuo was left, but 
perhaps that was enough: he was beating Rin, regardless of her strength 
or blade.

&quot;Pathetic!&quot; he shouted, slapping her hard. &quot;You&#39;re pathetic, Takamatsu! 
You are no better than your father! To think that I had you as prey! I 
would have had more challenge facing a nursery!&quot;

&quot;You...take that back!&quot; snarled Rin. Her mouth was bleeding, and she had 
sores all over her body. She was lucky to have avoided The Crimson 
Blade&#151;a single touch might&#39;ve killed her, even if it had nicked her&#151;but 
even with Aura&#39;s presence (and Lady Luck was in Rin&#39;s vicinity, knowing 
the older woman would need good fortune), she wouldn&#39;t last long. She 
stood to fight again, but her spirit did not last long. Sashuo was like 
a bull, fierce and unyielding, and he beat Rin back every time. He 
finally sliced her with his sword, a small cut on her thigh, which 
crippled her instantly (only with Aura&#39;s help was she spared).

The shadow of the man in green armor hovered over her like doom. He 
raised his blade, and announced, &quot;So ends my hunt, and your life. 
Consider the debt your father owed us...paid off!!!&quot; He thrust the 
terrible Blade with all his might&#151;Rin was too frightened to even 
scream&#151;and the mighty Ronin braced herself for her second journey to the 
afterlife.

The fatal blow never came. Sashuo was frozen in place.

&quot;What...is this?&quot; he whispered faintly. He jerked and shouted again, 
&quot;What is this? No, stop. Stop it! Get off...get off of me! Get them 
off!&quot; He danced wildly, swatting his body with his hands, trying to jerk 
off invisible attackers. Rin watched in amazement, but soon got 
goosebumps of horror as Sashuo screamed and flopped on the ground like a 
madman. &quot;AAAHH!! Get them off! They&#39;re all over me! Get them off!! 
Somebody, please! I beg of you! Get...them...AAAAAHHH!!!!!&quot; Roaring 
loudly, the man writhed in pain and fear, smothered by some 
indescribable force. As he stood to run in panic, an explosion ripped 
apart his haunting shrieks, and he stopped dead in his tracks, his 
throat suddenly bright red from blood. He slumped to the ground, dead, 
leaving only a cloud of dust and an army as his legacy.

In the distance, Rin could see a young girl shivering with terror and 
grief. She was scraggly and frail, and wept, probably from having to 
witness such a spectacle. Behind her was a middle-aged bald men, dressed 
in a priest&#39;s suit and carrying a smoking rifle. Rin stood up weakly, 
her leg searing in pain, and stared at the two. The older man placed his 
hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder, trying to comfort her nervous shaking.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Joyce. It&#39;s all right. You did well. Many people are in 
your debt.&quot; The girl, Joyce, said nothing as she turned around and 
buried her face in the older man&#39;s chest. He knelt and embraced her, 
hushing her as she sobbed. The Crimson Blades, amazed that their leader 
had been killed in such a manner, each dropped their swords and 
surrendered on the spot. Cobra, limping from a wound, approached the man 
with a look of concern.

&quot;Father Jacob, what the heck are you doing here?&quot;

......

It took quite some time for things to calm down. Despite many 
objections, the three Dead Zodiac were all properly buried, as Alia had 
been before them. G-Force and BK Power were inconsolable, despite the 
efforts of their friends. Bubblegum Black was unconscious, but alive and 
in fairly good shape at least, though she had some venom in her body 
from the dozens of stings she got. Many other people were recovering, 
but that didn&#39;t stop them from attending Jacob Pochanski&#39;s lecture. 
Apparently his brief absence had borne fruit.

&quot;I went to research the people that attacked us,&quot; he explained. &quot;It 
turns out they are part of a group of twelve that call themselves the 
Dead Zodiac. I found out that we have already eliminated four of their 
group: first Alia, the one they call the Harmonious Killer, and today, 
Yan of the Air, Valmont the Summoner, and Sashuo the Crimson Blade. That 
leaves eight others, three of whom we&#39;ve met.&quot;

&quot;So that six-armed creature was one of them?&quot; asked Siren.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;And that rock-creature, and the old man?&quot;

&quot;All of them.&quot; She sighed.

&quot;More work for us, then.&quot;

&quot;Yes indeed. For now, we&#39;ve all earned a rest. I am just glad that 
nobody was killed, although I am concerned for that young lady&#39;s leg.&quot; 
He pointed to Rin, who was gnashing her teeth together in pain. Cobra 
had treated the wound (because after all, snakes are associated with 
medicine), but it still felt like a flaming coal had been inserted into 
her thigh. For the moment she was relieved to be alive, and secretly 
thankful that she had one less person to kill. Yan had been one of 
Kissa&#39;s enemies; unfortunately, both Father Pochanski and Kat Shival, 
Bloodbane, were also on the list. Rin knew now that she could never kill 
either of them; they had both saved her life that day, although Shival 
played a smaller role. She, Kailin, and Angel each introduced themselves 
to the rest of the group, and were welcomed as allies.

&quot;I have a question,&quot; said Aura. &quot;Father, I&#39;ve seen Joyce&#39;s powers 
before. It was clear to me that she used them today, on that man who was 
about to kill Rin. I think I have an idea of what they are, but I&#39;m not 
sure exactly. Would you happen to know...&quot;

&quot;Not I,&quot; he replied. &quot;Best to ask Dr. Kamaguchi.&quot; Some of the team 
looked at Joyce, who was trying (and failing) to hide. She knew what 
they were thinking: monster, freak, terror-child, abomination, one of 
God&#39;s mistakes, a mutant, and so on. She didn&#39;t know they were really 
grateful to her for saving Rin, and even though she had helped 
immensely, she still felt bad for using her power.

&quot;Did you find anything else?&quot; asked Mora, wanting to break the silence.

&quot;Yes,&quot; he said; &quot;I also looked into this group calling themselves the 
Seven, who attacked you three,&quot; (pointing to Alisti, Julie, and Merry). 
&quot;They are apparently followers of a devil-man, or some kind of cult 
devoted to the seven deadly sins. Divas, you have already fought two, 
Wrath and Pride. I sense we&#39;ll have to fight them again.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re not dead?&quot; hissed Merry. Pochanski shook his head.

&quot;I checked into them last. As of yesterday, they are all still alive.&quot; 
Merry cursed violently, smashing the couch&#39;s armrest with her fist. She 
stormed off before anyone knew what was going on; Sally followed her, 
leaving everyone else to brood. The Seven and the Dead Zodiac&#151;plus, the 
woman that had killed Rin and Kailin, if she was still alive, and maybe 
even Kissa too. All of them were deadly threats, and nobody would be 
able to rest until they were gone. Unfortunately, Father Jacob did not 
know who they truly worked for or why they had been sent to kill 
everyone there, but he would soon.

Very soon.

......

&quot;Hey.&quot; Merry turned around and calmed down as she noticed her 
girlfriend.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Sally walked up and gently took the older woman&#39;s hand, and 
kissed her cheek. &quot;Don&#39;t. Just leave.&quot;

&quot;Look, I did something terrible too, and I feel just as bad as you do. 
But I&#39;m not going to give up on you, Merry. I care too much for you.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; she moaned. &quot;I&#39;m nothing but a raging bull, a tank meant only for 
destruction, no soul or heart at all.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not true,&quot; she whispered, turning to face the tall girl. &quot;You 
have a good heart, Merry Lynn, one that I adore. I know you have your 
bad spots&#151;so do I. And I know we&#39;re not always going to be the perfect 
couple, or even a good couple. But I want to stay together.&quot;

&quot;But why?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re my first,&quot; said Sally with a smile. &quot;First loves are always 
special. I want to give you a chance. You said that everyone abandoned 
you after you demonstrated your rage, so I want to be the one that 
stays. I&#39;ll stay no matter what; there&#39;s no getting rid of me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a fool,&quot; moaned the poor girl. She looked down at Sally, the 
beautiful blue blonde, smiled faintly, and wept as they embraced. 
&quot;You&#39;re so good...so good to me! What did I ever do to deserve...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re a sweet and caring young lady, but you don&#39;t need to do anything 
for me to love you. And I do...&quot; They kissed, Merry feeling the weight 
come off her shoulders, and kept their lips tied, just as they were 
tied, for better and for worse.

&quot;Thanks, Sal,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Thanks for staying with me. You&#39;re a 
strong girl to do that.&quot; Sally smiled and kissed Merry&#39;s tears away. To 
hold each other, quietly and privately, was more than they could ask for 
in terms of the day&#39;s conclusion, but in truth, it wasn&#39;t over yet. As 
Merry opened her bleary eyes and smiled, she noticed somebody coming up 
that would change the course of her life&#151;somebody she recognized at 
once.

&quot;Oh my God,&quot; she whispered in shock: &quot;...Kagemusha? Is that you?&quot;
