<h1>The Student and the Goddess (part 20 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>      &quot;Seriously. You guys aren&#39;t hetero enough,&quot; Abby said, disappointed. &quot;Uh, um... we... 
we&#39;re sorry?&quot; Seth said, looking over at Tycara. Currently the couple was seated on the 
couch with Abby sitting across from them rubbing her temples.

      &quot;At first, it was just Eveon and Mina... then Krystal and Isaka. That was cool, I mean 
since I&#39;m straight and you guys are a couple, we were evenly balanced out. But this,&quot; Abby 
said, letting out a huge sigh, &quot;is preposterous. We have another couple in here since Erin 
decided to come here with her long lost lesbian lover of a goddess or whatever the hell they 
are. We&#39;re losing the battle here...&quot;

      Seth and Tycara had no clue what she was talking about, but Eveon advised them to just 
let her rant when she was in one of her &#39;moods&#39;. &quot;I&#39;m quite sure Faye is having her naughty 
little way with Erin-&quot; As if on cue, they heard a muffled moan from one of the bedrooms, 
&quot;-and Krystal and Isaka might be taking it to the next level. Right now, I am so happy that 
Mina&#39;s parents are back and she&#39;s at home, but I know Eveon just snuck out because I saw her 
running across the lawn ten minutes ago.&quot;

      Seth just said, &quot;Abby... we&#39;re sorry you&#39;re surrounded by lesbians, but that&#39;s just 
the way they are. I mean, they&#39;re in love, so it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal, right?&quot; Abby 
massaged her temples. &quot;Oh please, being a single woman surrounded by lesbians isn&#39;t easy, 
mister. I feel my straightness slowly being deteriorated.&quot;

      Tycara giggled. &quot;Oh, I understand. It&#39;s kind of like how I felt living with Isaka. She 
made me feel strange for being straight...&quot;  

***** 

      Speaking of a certain demon... she was sprawled out on the bed, waiting for Krystal to 
come out of the bathroom. The blonde woman peeked her head out of the bathroom. &quot;Isaka, I 
know I said I would, but I can&#39;t wear this outfit!&quot;

      Isaka pouted. &quot;Please?&quot;

      &quot;Look, I know you have a fetish for innocent looking girls, but this frilly little 
thing is...&quot;

      Krystal let out a sigh as her words tapered off. Isaka was unrelenting. How this 
outfit was a turn on was beyond her. She hurriedly put it on and walked out, only to be 
greeted by Isaka&#39;s drool and sparkly eyes.

      It was a little nightgown (and by little, she meant little) and Krystal blushed 
uncomfortably. &quot;Why... did you want me to wear this?&quot; Isaka just squealed and squirmed on 
the bed. &quot;Because you look so lovely and innocent in it!&quot;

      Although she was embarrassed, Krystal smiled. She shut off the lights before crawling 
into bed. There was a bit of silence as Isaka cuddled up closely to her. Krystal whispered 
something to Isaka, &quot;I love you.&quot;

      Isaka looked at her in the dark and cupped her cheek. &quot;I know... I love you too.&quot; It 
was quiet as Krystal took a deep breath before finding Isaka&#39;s hand and kissing it. The 
demon smiled and held her closer. There was a rustling of cloth as Isaka&#39;s hands found their 
way beneath the nightgown.

      &quot;Isaka,&quot; Krystal said sternly and the demon let out a whine, but removed her hands. 
The exorcist leaned forward and nipped at Isaka&#39;s ear. &quot;Wait &#39;til we&#39;re home. I doubt Abby 
would appreciate us going at it at her house...&quot; 

***** 

      Erin sighed as Faye pulled away. She was starting to get sore thanks to her amorous 
partner. Speaking of which, Faye was now suckling her fingertips tenderly. &quot;Mmm... Faye... 
aren&#39;t you tired yet?&quot; The red head giggled. &quot;I&#39;m never going to get tired of you.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Erin said, turning over on her side to look at Faye. Her fingers were 
being held captive in her mouth. Erin leaned forward and kissed Faye on the forehead 
tenderly. &quot;I love you.&quot; The red head wrapped her arms around her. &quot;I love you too.&quot;

      It was then that Erin noticed something was dripping onto her shoulder. She pulled 
away from Faye to see she was crying. &quot;Faye? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked, gingerly wiping away 
her tears. &quot;I... I&#39;ve waited for so long and I&#39;m just so happy...&quot;

      Erin smiled warmly and hugged her. &quot;Shh... it&#39;s okay. I&#39;m not going to leave you.&quot; 
Faye was still crying, &quot;I-I know... when you lost your memory, I was devastated... I thought 
you didn&#39;t love me since you forgot...&quot;

      &quot;Faye... I remember it well now. I love you because of how you changed and became the 
sweet person I know now.&quot; She was still crying. &quot;If you stop crying, I&#39;d be willing to try 
out that bondage thing with you.&quot;

      Faye stopped crying and looked up at her hopefully. &quot;R-really?&quot; Erin was a little 
scared, but she nodded. &quot;Yes, but later.&quot; Faye just smiled and cuddled against her. 
&quot;Alright... just hold me.&quot; Erin obliged. 

***** 

      &quot;Your mom is probably happy that we aren&#39;t as amorous as the two couples at her 
house,&quot; Mina said absently, her head in Eveon&#39;s lap. &quot;Yep... I feel kind of bad, but I know 
she just complains for fun. She doesn&#39;t really mind because she&#39;s a hopeless romantic at 
heart. She cries every time we watch Titanic.&quot;

      Mina giggled at the thought. The two girls were sitting side by side against Mina&#39;s 
bed (or in the case of Mina, lying her head in her girlfriend&#39;s lap), watching TV. They had 
a myriad of pillows and blankets around them, along with popcorn and chocolate.

      Eveon absent mindedly stroked Mina&#39;s hair, smiling. Of course, until a monster in the 
scary movie they were watching popped out of nowhere and scared the bejeezus out of her. 
Mina sat up and laughed at her before hugging Eveon. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, if a monster attacks, I 
will protect you.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s really sweet and all, but I think I&#39;d be better off calling Krystal for help.&quot; 
That comment got Eveon a whap on the head via the pillow in Mina&#39;s hand. &quot;Ow...!&quot; Eveon 
pouted and Mina just sighed. The blonde girl smiled as her girlfriend gave her a quick kiss 
on the head. Mina then went for her lips and Eveon happily obliged.

      When the two pulled away, they turned back to the movie. About ten minutes later, Mina 
said, &quot;Hey, Eveon. Why did you come over so early? I thought you were going to come later.&quot;

      &quot;...Erin and Faye were on the same floor as me.&quot;

      &quot;Oh.&quot; 

***** 

      The following morning, the three couples said goodbye. Seth and Tycara were going back 
to his apartment (Isaka continued to threaten turning him into a girl) while Erin and Faye 
were going to Erin&#39;s house. The snake goddess had to fight to convince Faye that telling her 
parents was more important than them satisfying their needs. The red head grudgingly 
obliged.

      &quot;Can&#39;t we tell them later?&quot; Faye asked again as Erin started to summon her golem. 
&quot;No... if I let you have your way with me, we won&#39;t be seeing them for at least a few more 
days.&quot; As they both hopped onto the snake, they waved goodbye to everyone. &quot;We&#39;ll come back 
next month!&quot; Erin shouted happily before blushing as she was hugged intimately by Faye. The 
duo disappeared, and Seth and Tycara decided to leave as well.

      &quot;Erin&#39;s right,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re all going to have a reunion so it&#39;s a little silly to 
say bye, huh?&quot; Tycara just laughed and held his hand. &quot;We should get going Seth. You still 
have college exams to do.&quot; The young man sighed at the thought and waved bye before they 
left.

      Now, it was only Abby and Eveon and Mina... of course, there was Krystal and Isaka, 
both of whom were currently making their way out the door. &quot;Alright, if anything happens, be 
sure to call us,&quot; Krystal said, giving Eveon and Mina a hug. When she turned to Abby, the 
older woman just glared. &quot;Hell no, like I&#39;m going to trust you to give me a simple hug.&quot;

      Krystal smiled sheepishly before stepping away. Isaka sighed and patted both girls on 
the head before leaning down and whispering to Mina, &quot;If you ever need more advice, just 
call me, okay?&quot; Eveon gave Isaka a scared look. Who knew what kind of advice the demon was 
giving to her girlfriend?!

      Isaka turned to Abby and got a stone cold &#39;you-better-stay-the-hell-away-from-me&#39; 
look. The demon took a step back. &quot;Ah... so I guess we will see you next month?&quot; Abby gave a 
curt nod, obviously in a bad mood. The couple waved bye as the young mother shut the door. 
&quot;Mommy? Are you alright?&quot; Abby shook her head at Eveon&#39;s question.

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mina asked, both girls clearly worried. &quot;If you had to change the 
sheets in Erin and Faye&#39;s room, you wouldn&#39;t be too happy either. 

***** 

      &quot;Finally home...&quot; Krystal murmured out, feeling Isaka&#39;s arms wrap around her waist. 
&quot;Mmmhmm...&quot; The demon said, nuzzling into her neck. Krystal let out a happy sigh and giggled 
as Isaka started directing her to the bedroom. &quot;...you have a one track mind...&quot; Isaka just 
nipped at her ear. &quot;What do you expect when I&#39;m with someone as beautiful and kind as you?&quot;

      Soon, Krystal found herself lying on the bed with Isaka hovering over her. The demon 
leaned down to give her a nice, sweet kiss. As they continued to make out, Krystal suddenly 
pulled away. &quot;I feel like we&#39;re forgetting something...&quot; Isaka just shrugged and started 
kissing her neck. &quot;Don&#39;t worry so much...&quot;

      Krystal promptly forgot it, relishing in Isaka&#39;s ministrations and the hands rubbing 
her tummy. She pushed down the shoulders of the clothing Isaka was in as the demon grabbed 
the hem of her shirt. They froze when they heard a jingling sound. The two lovers exchanged 
glances, but hurriedly went back to undressing each other.

      &quot;Once we do this,&quot; Isaka whispered huskily into Krystal&#39;s ear, &quot;you&#39;ll be forever 
bound to me.&quot; Krystal just giggled, both of them now half naked. &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I want to 
be?&quot; Their precious moment was interrupted by another jingle.

      The demon&#39;s eye began to twitch. She wasn&#39;t about to let anything come in between her 
and making love to Krystal for the first time. Instead of addressing whatever that jingling 
was, she focused on unclasping Krystal&#39;s (predictably) white bra. Isaka almost had it when 
Krystal giggled. &quot;That tickles...!&quot;

      Isaka hadn&#39;t even started touching her yet... &quot;What does?&quot;

      &quot;Ah, my arm.&quot;

      Both of Isaka&#39;s hand were on her bra, so... Both women turned to Krystal&#39;s right arm 
and both of them were startled. Wrapped around Krystal&#39;s hand was none other than Posh-Posh, 
bouncing his head and happily jingling his bell. Krystal shrieked a bit and shook him off 
her arm. She was blushing up a storm. &quot;He... almost saw us... you know...!&quot;

      Isaka stared at Krystal and realized something terrible had just happened - Posh-Posh 
just ruined their intimate moment... she was planning on making sweet, tender love to her 
delicate, virgin Krystal, but... but...

      &quot;You...!&quot; Isaka growled menacingly to the snake... &quot;You&#39;re going to pay for 
interrupting me!&quot; She lunged at it and the poor snake slithered out of the way. Isaka began 
to chase it. &quot;You pesky little thing! Get back here! Because of you, I&#39;m going to be 
unsatisfied for the rest of the night.&quot;

      Krystal just sat there, blushing. Now she knew what they had forgotten... 

***** 

      Isaka was extremely disgruntled. Thanks to that damned serpent, she was unsatisfied. 
And cranky. Plus, she&#39;d been giving Krystal searing looks. The exorcist sighed, cradling the 
tiny snake in her hand. Posh-Posh was lucky that he was fast.

      The pair dissolved into the shadows and reappeared at Faye&#39;s house. They were in the 
living room. &quot;Isaka! Isn&#39;t it a bit intrusive to appear in her living room?&quot; The demon just 
snorted. &quot;Whatever. Erin already told her parents everything, so they should be back. I just 
want to give her little pet voyeur back so we,&quot; she added extra emphasis to the word, &quot;can 
finish what we started.&quot;

      Krystal flushed red thanks to Isaka&#39;s hungry look. It always scared her a little when 
Isaka got this worked up. The demon wanted her so badly... Isaka walked to the hallway and 
headed towards what she assumed was Faye&#39;s bedroom. She should have known better... Krystal 
tried to warn her, but before she knew it, the demon had flung open the door and the two 
were in for an interesting sight.

      Erin was tied to the bed by Faye&#39;s ribbons and her mouth gagged as well. Faye was 
currently sitting upon the naked girl, equally nude, and obviously having her naughty little 
way with Erin. The two girls looked over at the exorcist and the demon. An awkward silence 
permeated throughout the room.

      &quot;We&#39;ll... just wait outside,&quot; Krystal said before slowly closing the door. 

***** 

      Faye wasn&#39;t too happy to untie Erin (the poor girl didn&#39;t realize what Faye meant by 
bondage) and the two of them were now properly dressed. Krystal held up Posh-Posh. &quot;I think 
he belongs to you.&quot; Erin took him into her arms happily. &quot;Posh-Posh! So this is where you&#39;ve 
been hiding... but you&#39;re still little...&quot;

      The dark haired girl stroked him carefully, his golden bell jingling. &quot;If you want, I 
can return him to his original form...&quot; Krystal said, but Erin shook her head. &quot;Nah... he&#39;d 
be too big for me to take care of and he wouldn&#39;t fit in Faye&#39;s house. Plus, I don&#39;t have 
any need for a giant snake.&quot; She giggled as he slithered up her arm and draped himself 
around her neck.

      The two girls would have continued chit-chatting if they weren&#39;t suddenly aware that 
they were being stared at. They looked up to see Faye and Isaka whispering and constantly 
sending their respective partners meaningful looks. Krystal gulped. Seeing as Faye was 
really wild... she didn&#39;t want to know what kind of information she was swapping with Isaka.

      When they noticed that their lovers were staring at them, Faye and Isaka laughed. &quot;Oh 
don&#39;t look at us like that... it&#39;s just friendly talk between us pitchers,&quot; Faye said and 
Isaka laughed some more. It didn&#39;t help that their laughs sounded rather devious, like the 
way they would laugh while taking advantage of a poor, innocent-

      Krystal wasn&#39;t feeling too good about this. &quot;Well, Krystal...&quot; Isaka murmured huskily, 
&quot;It&#39;s time for us to go home.&quot; As Isaka started to drag her to the door, she sent Erin a 
&#39;help-me!&#39; look. Erin reciprocated that strange expression as Faye started to drag her back 
to the bedroom. &quot;You and I aren&#39;t finished, my sweet little serpent.&quot;

      Posh-Posh slithered off of Erin and plopped down on the couch, where he proceeded to 
sleep, regardless of the loud noises his mommy was letting out in the bedroom. 

***** 

      Krystal sighed happily as she exited the shower. She was currently dressed in her 
bathrobe, but... Where was Isaka? She looked around the bedroom, unable to locate her. That 
was a bit worrisome. Isaka had this look in her eye earlier that basically said, &quot;I&#39;m going 
to devour you.&quot; Krystal was vaguely disappointed.

      ...until she felt arms wrap around her and an eager mouth latched onto her neck. 
&quot;Isaka...&quot; she moaned out as the demon allowed her hands to slip between the bathrobe. &quot;I&#39;ve 
waited so long for this...&quot; She growled out before delicately laying Krystal on the bed.

      &quot;No snakes this time?&quot; Krystal asked playfully, only to find Isaka licking at her 
fingers. &quot;No snakes. Just you and me.&quot; Krystal was definitely nervous, but... but... she 
trusted Isaka. The demon gave the exorcist a soft, gentle kiss before taking off her 
bathrobe.

      &quot;...I love you Isaka.&quot;

      &quot;I love you too.&quot;

      &quot;...but what were talking to Faye about?&quot; Krystal&#39;s question was answered with a 
devious laugh and she knew she was in for it.
