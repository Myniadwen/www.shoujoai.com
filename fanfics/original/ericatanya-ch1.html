<h1>Erica and Tanya: or You Ought to Be in Pictures! (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>There was a low rumble, a sound like thunder, dust and smoke filling the 
air. After the fire and light finally died down there was a eerie moment 
of pure silence on the battlefield. The smoke faded, the rough terrain 
finally becoming visible, and the figure that watched over it intently.

Standing there on a platform just above the burning rubble and ruin, a 
gorgeous woman dressed all in black leather began to laugh. She threw 
her head back happily, her long blond hair flowing around her face as 
the light caught on the metal armor over her leather, the handgun that 
she carried in her hand gleaming.

&quot;I&#39;ve won,&quot; she loudly crowed, &quot;won!&quot; Flipping her long red cape back so 
that it swirled around her she declared, &quot;At long last I have finally 
defeated her!&quot;

The piles of rubble below her were quiet, as if cowed by her frightening 
will, then suddenly they began to shift slightly. With the sound of 
stone grinding on stone, barely visible through the smoke, slowly the 
largest chunk of material began to rise up. It teetered there, and in a 
final burst of nearly superhuman strength it was tossed aside. Shrugging 
off the last pieces of the rubble the woman who was revealed there 
slowly stood up, short dark hair falling in her eyes, blood and dirt 
staining her military style uniform.

&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; the blonde woman gaped down at her in shock, &quot;it&#39;s simply 
not possible!&quot; Her face, once so beautiful, was twisted by anger into 
something quite inhuman.

Red blood trickled down into her face, and from the look in her dark 
eyes it was obvious that she was in immense pain. But her voice rang out 
clearly across the ruins, &quot;You haven&#39;t beaten me yet, Empress.&quot; 
Straightening up she met the blonde&#39;s gaze defiantly as she loudly 
declared, &quot;You will never conquer the people&#39;s will to be free.&quot;

&quot;You still live,&quot; the blonde grated out, &quot;an error that I&#39;ll soon 
correct.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome to try,&quot; the soldier answered. The two gazed at each 
other intensely, and a spark seemed to strike between them until...

&quot;Cut!&quot; the director called out happily from the sidelines. With that 
signal the smoke machines were all shut down, and several crew members 
carrying fire extinguishers rushed to put out the fires that were still 
burning in the false rubble. &quot;Tanya, Erica, that was just marvelous,&quot; 
the brown haired, glasses wearing man rushed forward with a broad grin 
on his handsome face.

The blonde shook her head slightly at that as she climbed down a 
carefully concealed ladder from the raised platform. &quot;I think Erica was 
the one with the harder job,&quot; Tanya called to him softly. She quickly 
reached the ground, then walked over to the other woman stood and 
worriedly asked her, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Erica Simmons smiled, dusting herself off with one hand. &quot;Oh, this?&quot; she 
scooped up some of the blood that was still running down her face. She 
dramatically stuck her fingers into her mouth and exclaimed, &quot;Ah, I&#39;ve 
always liked ketchup the best.&quot;

&quot;Erica, please don&#39;t gross out your co-star,&quot; the director scolded Erica 
gently, punching her lightly in the shoulder.

&quot;Sorry, Simon,&quot; she gave her friend a cheeky little grin. &quot;It really is 
made out of ketchup,&quot; Erica turned to reassure Tanya.

Tanya Clark reached out, gently getting a bit of the red on her fingers 
and sniffing at it cautiously. &quot;Ketchup,&quot; she blinked.

&quot;We&#39;re on a budget,&quot; Simon shrugged, &quot;and the FX guys have found that 
diluted ketchup with a bit of die looks really good on film.&quot;

&quot;I guess that makes sense,&quot; Tanya shook her head.

&quot;And don&#39;t downplay your part in this,&quot; Erica added. She smiled as she 
added, &quot;You can&#39;t have a good hero without a great villain.&quot;

&quot;Very true,&quot; Simon firmly agreed, but he had the oddest smile on his 
face as he watched the two of them interacting.

Erica frowned at Simon, and he tried to look innocent. &quot;Now if you don&#39;t 
mind,&quot; the dusty, red stained Erica smiled at them slightly, &quot;I&#39;m going 
to go get cleaned up for the next scene.&quot;

&quot;Remember, the kiss scene is coming up next,&quot; a grinning Simon called 
out to her as she was walking away from the two of them.

&quot;You just had to remind me,&quot; Erika shot back with a cheeky grin, &quot;I&#39;m so 
going to make you pay for all of this later.&quot;

&quot;I take it you two are old friends?&quot; Tanya smiled at him slightly as 
they headed over to her dressing room. &#39;What kiss?&#39; she wondered. She 
had come onboard this set on Simon&#39;s personal recommendation, but she 
had only met him herself on a couple of projects a few months ago. &#39;What 
kiss is this?&#39; Obviously he knew the famous Erica Simmons pretty well, 
to be talking like that.

&quot;I&#39;ve known her for years,&quot; Simon agreed, &quot;from back when we both were 
in Vancouver film school together.&quot; He smiled fondly as he remembered, 
&quot;It was long before she hit it big on the live action &#39;Evangelion&#39; 
movie.&quot;

&quot;What roll did she play?&quot; Tanya blinked.

&quot;Shinji Ikari,&quot; Simon grinned at the startled look on her face, &quot;she did 
the entire movie dressed up in a boy&#39;s school uniform or the EVA 
plugsuit.&quot; He chuckled softly, &quot;All the girls fell in love with her, it 
was crazy.&quot;

&quot;Remarkable,&quot; Tanya murmured, feeling a bit of a blush to her cheeks. 
She had been one of those who had fallen for the soulful, angst filled 
portrait Erica had created for that character, and the knowledge that it 
had been a woman who did that disturbed her oddly.

&quot;I was really impressed,&quot; Simon looked over at her with as smile, &quot;when 
I saw you in the &#39;Blood&#39; series of movies.&quot;

&quot;Oh, god,&quot; Tanya made a face, &quot;those b-movies?&quot;

Simon laughed, &quot;Yeah, they were a bit cheesy. But you were so striking 
in them, the vampire fighting her urges to protect others.&quot;

&quot;I remember,&quot; Tanya admitted. Her manner seemed to change, a dark 
expression on he face as she mimed holding a man aloft. &quot;Surrender,&quot; she 
quoted the role eerily, &quot;I would say surrender or die, but that&#39;d be a 
bit redundant.&quot;

Simon chuckled softly, &quot;Exactly. You took a fairly two-dimensional 
character and made her believable, even sympathetic at times. That&#39;s the 
sort of thing I thought we needed for this film.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Tanya smiled, her blonde hair blowing back from her face as they 
walked, &quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re giving me this opportunity.&quot;

&quot;Ah.. there&#39;s something that I wanted to mention about the next scene,&quot; 
Simon said with a false sort of casualness, &quot;just so that you&#39;re 
prepared.&quot;

Tanya looked over at him curiously at that. Simon had that, &#39;I am in so 
much trouble&#39; smile on his handsome face, the same look that he had when 
he had told Erica she was going to be completely buried in a pile of 
foam cast rubble. She hadn&#39;t been on a set with him for very long, but 
she already knew that look and voice was going to be trouble.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Tanya asked warily.

&quot;About that kissing scene,&quot; Simon&#39;s voice dropped to nearly a whisper as 
he quietly explained what was going to be happening.

Once Simon finished Tanya looked over at him in shock, &quot;What?!&quot;

It wasn&#39;t too long after that when Erica stepped out of her private 
trailer, dressed in a much cleaner, undamaged version of the black 
military uniform she had worn earlier. She didn&#39;t seem very surprised to 
see Tanya standing there, waiting for her.

&quot;Simon told you about the kiss, right?&quot; Erica asked the blonde gently.

Tanya puffed out a nervous breath, &quot;I don&#39;t remember seeing that in any 
script I got.&quot; She looked over at Erica, &quot;How did that happen?&quot;

&quot;Simon and the writer got to talking after we finished shooting on the 
first day,&quot; Erica smiled at her wryly, &quot;something that you should never 
let happen while making a movie.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s happened before?&quot; Tanya blinked.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Erica agreed, &quot;It seems they got into the sexual tension 
going on between the heroine and the villainess and decided that it 
should really be realized at least once.&quot;

Tanya waved the day&#39;s script pages around, the bunch of sheets matching 
those given to the rest of the actors. &quot;So they decided to add this 
scene in?&quot; she sighed.

&quot;That&#39;s pretty much it,&quot; Erica gave her a thoughtful look, as if she was 
considering saying something more.

&quot;What?&quot; Tanya asked.

&quot;If the kiss is a real problem for you,&quot; Erica finally said softly, &quot;I&#39;m 
pretty sure that Simon could ask someone to stand in for you then. A bit 
of digital editing later and I bet that no one would even know the 
difference.&quot;

Tanya frowned slightly, standing there silently for a few moments. 
&quot;Maybe so,&quot; she finally said, &quot;but I&#39;d know it wasn&#39;t me.&quot; She looked 
over to meet Erica&#39;s eyes, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll promise to be a perfect gentleman,&quot; Erica smiled back 
at her as she gently offered this reassurance.

Tanya looked over at her fellow actress, and was struck by how handsome 
she really was. The dark hair styled boyishly, a man&#39;s military uniform, 
and that oh so charming smile. &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; she managed to answer with 
a smile.

&#39;Tanya really is cute,&#39; Erica reflected as she watched the tall blonde 
walking away from her, &#39;and a real trooper, too. I know quite a few 
actresses who would have just flat out refused to do any of this, 
especially after it being sprung on them.&#39;</pre>
