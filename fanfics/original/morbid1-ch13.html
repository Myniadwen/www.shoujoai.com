Victoria crawled out from her hiding spot behind the bar and surveyed 
the mess that had become of her caf&eacute;. There were several bodies lying on 
the ground, the tables where scattered here and there, and the front 
wall was totally destroyed by the creature as it left the building. She 
tiptoed through the rubble till she came across Elizabeth buried partly 
under a table. 

&quot;Elizabeth, are you alright?&quot; Victoria whispered, not sure she wanted to 
know if the woman was alive, or undead for that matter. She had already 
watched Charles walk out of the caf&eacute; not that long ago and she was not 
sure she could handle if another of her friends came back from the dead. 

Elizabeth lifted her head slightly, &quot;All right, as I will ever be, 
considering.&quot; She remarked as she pushed the table off her legs, &quot;How is 
Samuel? Is he alright?&quot; She inquired anxiously. 

Victoria shook her head, &quot;He... is dead...&quot; She answered taking a 
glimpse back at the bar where she spent the past few hours with the dead 
painter, &quot;I do not think he will be getting up either.&quot; She tried to 
shake the horrible image from her mind. 

&quot;Where is Charles?&quot; Elizabeth asked as she got to her feet and scanned 
the caf&eacute; in search of her friend. 

&quot;He walked off muttering something about needing a new suit and tie.&quot; 
Victoria stated as she stepped towards the large hole that used to be 
the front door, &quot;How am I going to repair this?&quot; She asked herself, 
still baffled by all that had happened. 

Elizabeth stepped through the opening to get a better look when she 
spotted Jamie&#39;s headless body laying on the road, &quot;Oh, no.... Jamie... 
love...&quot; She started to stagger towards the girl when Victoria grabbed 
her and pulled the sobbing woman into her arms. 

&quot;Don&#39;t look.&quot; Victoria commanded, &quot;Just hope that she didn&#39;t suffer.&quot; 

Elizabeth glanced into the landladies eyes in horror, &quot;How could this 
happen?&quot; She demanded frantically, &quot;Don&#39;t you even care?&quot; She weakly 
punched at Victoria&#39;s chest and let out another sob, &quot;First, Charles, 
then Samuel and now Jamie too. I can&#39;t stand it anymore.&quot; 

Victoria held the woman tightly and let her cry upon her shoulder, &quot;Just 
let it out.&quot; She soothingly said while rubbing the woman&#39;s back, &quot;Don&#39;t 
think of her as she is, but how she was.&quot; She glanced up at Jamie&#39;s dead 
body one more time, deciding that she would use that gold coin Jamie 
gave her the other day to give the girl a proper burial. As her mind 
rushed over what she should do she noticed Jamie&#39;s hand begin to twitch, 
&quot;Oh no.... Jamie...&quot; She put a hand to her mouth as she watched the body 
begin to push itself out of the pool of blood it laid in and into a 
seated position. 

&quot;What is happening?&quot; Elizabeth demanded. She tried to turn around, 
however Victoria had a strong hold on her and forced her face into her 
shoulder. 

&quot;You don&#39;t want to see.&quot; Victoria explained horrified by the sight. She, 
herself, could not take her eyes off Jamie&#39;s body as it tried to get to 
it&#39;s feet then fell over for its leg was slightly twisted, &quot;It will only 
make you cry.&quot; The body grabbed hold of the deformed leg and snapped it 
back in place, and then did the same to its arm and popped it back into 
the shoulder socket. Victoria cringed at the sound the echoed in the 
cold silent night, closing her eyes at the sound of snapping bones and 
grinding cartilage. When she opened an eye again she saw the body was 
getting to its feet. It had found it&#39;s hat and placed it upon the stump 
of its neck then faced left then right, almost as if it was looking for 
something. As if it had made up its mind the body plunged its hands into 
its pocket and started down the road. 

Elizabeth finally freed herself from Victoria&#39;s embrace in time to watch 
the corpse walk off into the distance. Her eyes grew wide and she shook 
her head violently, &quot;No no no no no NOOOOO!!!!&quot; Her screams could be 
heard through out the quiet street that dark afternoon, however very few 
seemed to care.

Alex glanced upon her wristwatch and frowned, &quot;Odd, it says that it is 
only four o&#39;clock and yet.&quot; She glanced up at the sky, which was pitch 
black, making it feel more like night then mid day. 

&quot;I think it is neat, Lady Alexandria.&quot; Alice exclaimed excitedly, &quot;All 
spooky and grim. The perfect kind of day for a killing.&quot; 

&quot;She is right on that account, dear sister.&quot; Alison chimed with a swift 
nod, &quot;It is a perfect night indeed.&quot; 

&quot;Do either of you not find this a little unusual?&quot; Alex inquired 
scanning their surroundings. Alex was usually the one to notice things 
that were out of place before the others, hence her being the leader of 
their little group, &quot;I mean yesterday Amanda&#39;s body walks off and today 
the sky is black as night. Plus we have not ran into a soul in hours.&quot; 

&quot;Well there is someone, Lady Alexandria.&quot; Alice pointed across the road 
at Jamie&#39;s body trudging along the sidewalk. It stopped for a moment and 
fixed its hat revealing the bloody stub of a neck then started on its 
way again, &quot;Now that is a sight. I&#39;ve never seen a headless person 
before.&quot; 

Alex was slightly startled by the sight, &quot;Maybe we should try to get 
some answers. This is beyond anything I have ever encountered before.&quot; 

&quot;No really? We see headless people walking around everyday.&quot; Alison 
stated sarcastically, &quot;So genius, who do plan to get answers from? Our 
dim-witted father, or perhaps our half brained sister, or did you plan 
to ask that nitwit of a butler? Hmmm?&quot; She inquired with a smug grin.

Alex ignored her sister and turned to Alice, &quot;What about your Aunt? She 
studies witchcraft and the like, does she not?&quot; 

Alice nervously ran her toe in a circle on the ground and looked down, 
&quot;Well, the problem is she does not like you noble types.&quot; She was 
embarrassed to say, &quot;She seems to think you are the reason for us living 
in the woods.&quot; 

Alex let out a frustrated sigh, &quot;Then I guess we talk to our dim-witted 
father.&quot; She looked up to see Charles in front of a clothing shop trying 
to get the owners to open the door, &quot;Or at the very least get indoor for 
it might be safer then staying out here.&quot; She admitted.

The two other girls nodded in agreement as they got a look at the man&#39;s 
torn up chest and followed Alex towards Holland Manor. 

*****

Clara throw salt at the tentacle as it crawled further along the 
balcony, &quot;It cannot be too much to ask for you to be related to a slug, 
now can it?&quot; She pleaded as she tossed another handful of salt at the 
beast only to have the creature shake the salt off, &quot;I guess that would 
be a no then...&quot; 

&quot;Ummm... Mother?&quot; Maria walked along the balcony towards her mother, 
Jamie in her arms and Amanda close behind her. Maria eyed the tentacle 
strangely, &quot;A new pet, mother?&quot; She inquired amused by the prospect. 

Clara kicked at the creature then poured a line of salt across the 
balcony, &quot;Just an unwelcome guest.&quot; She explained as she emptied the 
last of the salt onto the floor, &quot;Hopefully that will slow you down. Now 
stay put.&quot; She demanded and clapped the salt off her hands then turned 
to her daughter and smiled at the teddy in her daughter&#39;s arms, &quot;I see 
you are taking to Lord Tegoth.&quot;

Jamie rolled her eyes, &quot;My nam-&quot; Maria cupped her hand over Jamie&#39;s 
mouth. 

&quot;Mother... I... was curious.&quot; Maria said cautiously.

&quot;That is good.&quot; Her mother stated as she passed by her daughter, &quot;Come 
with me and we can talk. What is it you were curious about?&quot; 

She followed her mother down the stairs to the main hall, &quot;It is... 
Tegoth.&quot; She explained, trying hard to sort her questions out, &quot;I 
thought he was just a teddy bear but realized that he is much more. How 
did you make him?&quot; She knew that her mother was always willing to 
explain her experiments to her daughter for ever since Maria was young 
her mother would try to get her daughter interested in science. 

Clara stopped in mid step, causing Maria and Amanda to stumble to catch 
their step, and she turned to look at her creation, &quot;It is very 
interesting that you ask. It was not an easy task I can tell you.&quot; 

&quot;What have you done to me?&quot; Jamie spouted out, frustrated by all the 
stalling. 

Clara took Jamie from her daughter and held her high, &quot;So you can 
finally speak. This is wonderful. I was not sure considering I had to 
graft your vocal cords with that mutts throat.&quot; 

&quot;So you did use Anita&#39;s dog?!?&quot; Amanda exclaimed aghast. 

Carla seemed startled by the girls out burst, &quot;Well you see, I only had 
the boy&#39;s head to work with so I needed to find some internal organs and 
other important things.&quot;

&quot;That would explain why you didn&#39;t realize I am a girl.&quot; Jamie muttered 
under her breath. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; Clara inquired, &quot;I will be your mother-in-law soon so I 
want you to treat me with respect and speak clearly when talking to me.&quot; 
She demanded. &quot;And refer to me as Lady Greystoke or my lady from now on 
is that clear?&quot;

Jamie&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;Are you really serious about this marriage 
thing?&quot; She interjected. &quot;Uhhh.. Lady Greystoke...&quot;

&quot;Why do you think I brought you back to life?&quot; Clara announced, &quot;You are 
to wed my daughter here.&quot; She turned Jamie around the face Maria who 
gave the bear a timid smile. 

Jamie found the idea of being wed to such a lovely girl was more then 
she could dream possible, then her mind turned to the night before. How 
was she to be intimate with Maria in this form, &quot;What about my body, my 
lady?&quot; She inquired once again, &quot;I am a bloody teddy bear!!!&quot; She 
exclaimed frantically.  

Clara handed Jamie back to Maria, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Tegoth.&quot; She started to 
apologize when Jamie cut the woman off. 

&quot;My name is Jamie, my lady.&quot; She snarled in frustration, if she was 
going to living this new life she, at the very least, would prefer to be 
referred to by her real name. 
			
&quot;James...&quot; Clara thought for a moment a muddled the name over in her 
mind, &quot;What a noble sounding name.&quot; She turned and started down the 
stairs again, &quot;Well, Young Lord James. You see we could only recover 
your head. I needed to work fast or I would never be able to restore 
you. You will find you can eat, drink and even bathe; I used the dog&#39;s 
internal organs, muscles and hide. Even improved things a little giving 
you a small thumb and even managed to hook up your nervous system 
properly. You should be able to do all the things you used to when 
alive.&quot;

&quot;Accept make love.&quot; Jamie muttered under her breath, quieter this time 
so Clara would not hear, however Maria did and her face went flush. 

Abruptly there was a heavy knocking at the door and Clara glanced upon 
the clock hanging on the wall, &quot;Strange. I wasn&#39;t expecting any 
visitors.&quot; She turned to the girls, &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; She quickly 
descended the stairs and cross the hall.     

Jamie crossed her paws and let out a huff, &quot;This is a fine situation.&quot; 

&quot;Jamie, she means well.&quot; Maria commented and leaned closer to the bear&#39;s 
ear, &quot;There are other ways to pleasure each other.&quot; She stated 
mischievously, blowing on the back of Jamie&#39;s ear causing the girl to 
shiver, &quot;Your senses seem to be the same as before.&quot; She noted with a 
giggle. 

Jamie felt herself flush this time, &quot;You are evil, my lady.&quot; She stated 
to her lover. 

Amanda let out a small giggle, &quot;I think you two make a cute couple.&quot; She 
explained with a grin. 

&quot;What the hell!!!&quot; Clara cried out from across the hall. The girls 
rushed over to the front door to see Jamie&#39;s body standing on the steps. 
It took off its hat and bowed upon the presence of Maria. 

&quot;M... my... body!!!!&quot; Jamie exclaimed in shock.
