<pre>A/N: &#39;Ello, there all of ya! This is my first yuri fic. ^_____^ ENJOY!!

I sit on my stomach, pencil in my hand and diary in front of me. It&#39;s 
the last page in my diary. Lily gave it to me when I first invited her 
to my birthday party, eleven years ago. I sigh. We&#39;ve been best friends 
for so long now, it feels like we&#39;re sisters. Before I wrote my last 
entry, I looked at the second-to-last page I wrote six months ago.

&quot;Crap. Nothing to write yet...&quot; I mumble as I close my diary, get up, 
and put my diary and pencil on a shelf. Before I wrote the last entry, I 
wanted something extraordinary to happen: I wanted something good to 
write about. I wanted something amazing to happen - just with Lily and 
I.

I take off my jeans, put on my pajama pants, and put my pajama top over 
my purple tee. I scamper onto my bed like a mad hamster, tuck myself in, 
and turn out the lamp next to my bed. And then I dream.

I dream about Lily. She looks so beautiful with her blonde hair in a 
French braid, and her big blue eyes happy and bright. She walks toward 
me happily, closes her eyes and flashes me a big toothy smile.

&quot;Bridge, let&#39;s go eat some icecream!&quot; the short girl says to me as she 
grabs my hand and we run up misty cloud steps into what felt like 
Heaven. An icecream bowl is now on my lap, chocolate. A golden spoon 
appears in my right hand, and I start eating the cold chocolatey 
goodness.

I wake up to the phone ringing. I groggily get up and fall to the floor 
with the blanket around my ankles. I push myself up, and hop over to the 
phone, barely reaching it. I pick it up, and groggily ask, &quot;Hello...?&quot;

&quot;Hiya, Bridge! I hope I&#39;m not calling too early for you... it&#39;s past 
12:00,&quot; I smile when I hear her voice, charming and happy.

&quot;Hi, Lily! I just woke up... so, why did you call?&quot; my sleepiness fades.

&quot;My dad&#39;s working at the pool today. Wanna come with me?&quot; my heart 
races.

And Lily can tell. &quot;I know how you love to swim.&quot;

&quot;Sure, Lils,&quot; even though I can&#39;t see her, I can tell she&#39;s smiling.

&quot; &#39;Kay, I&#39;ll pick you up at 1:30! Is that okay?&quot; I love that quality 
about Lily - she cares about other people more than anyone can.

&quot;Okay... bye Lils,&quot; I sing in reply.

&quot;Buh-BYE, Bridgie-Boo!&quot; she hangs up first, and I put the phone down on 
the charger after hanging up.

I dash out of my room, and go to the kitchen. Mom&#39;s waiting for me 
there.

&quot;Hey, Hon!&quot; she greets.

&quot;Hi Mom. I&#39;m going to the pool with Lily,&quot; I grab some bread out of a 
bag and begin nibbling. I finish quickly, run up to my room, take off my 
clothes, grab and put on my black one-piece bathing suit, put shorts on, 
and black flip-flops. Again, I dash to the kitchen, go into the dining 
room, and jog out the front door to see Lily in her new sparkly red 
convertable.

&quot;Hey, Bridgie! Come on,&quot; I jog toward the car, open the door, and get 
into the passengers&#39; seat.

Lils drives down the street, none of us saying a word, and we finally 
get to the huge inside pool. She parks the car and we get out, and only 
then does she say something to me.

&quot;You look really sexy in that swimsuit, Bridge!!&quot; it was a compliment, 
but it felt weird when it came out of my best friend to me...

&quot;Thanks...&quot; I mumble. I can tell I&#39;m blushing. And so can she.

&quot;I don&#39;t mean that in a perverted way, Bridge... sorry if I made it 
sound like...!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine! I didn&#39;t take it the wrong way! Thanks!!&quot; I blurted out, and 
Lily giggled.

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; together, we walk into the building, and then into the 
changing room. Suddenly, un-easiness fills me. What if she&#39;s... I 
gulp... naked underneath? Over the years I have seen her naked, but it 
never bothered me. Why does it now? She takes off her orange sun dress, 
and underneath... is an orange bikini top with white polka dots and 
orange swim-shorts. She turns toward me, but I start taking my shorts 
off before she finds out I was staring at her. We put our things in 
lockers, and we leave the changing room.

&quot;I love your swimsuit even more, Bridgie-Boo...&quot; she sweetly says. I 
gulped.

&quot;Thanks, yours rocks too,&quot; I says nervously, smiling.

&quot;Thank you!&quot; she replied as we approach the nearly empty pool. She jumps 
in first, and shivers. I jump in, and I realize why she is - the water&#39;s 
freezing!

&quot;B-b-brrr...&quot; I mumble as I dunk my head under the icy water. I get my 
head out of the water, and Lily dives under. When she gets up she&#39;s far 
away from me, and I quickly swim out toward her. I finally catch up, and 
I&#39;m right next to her. I swim faster, faster, faster, and I move right 
in front of her.

Then I feel cloth on my left foot and Lily yelps. I stop swimming and 
turn around, and I see an orange bikini top with white polka dots 
drifting ever so slightly away from my tan feet. And then I look at 
Lily... topless. She covers her chest with her arms, and I can&#39;t see 
anything - which is better for both of us.

&quot;Br-Bridget!&quot; she yells angrily at me as she starts to cry. She grabs 
her top and got out of the pool, running, never looking back as I lose 
sight of her.

It was that night. I felt horrible about what had happened that day... I 
think about Lily, but something feels different... she doesn&#39;t feel like 
my best friend... I want to be more than that with her now... I want to 
be hers, and I want her to be mine. I realize why I never got a date in 
my life - because Lily was the one I loved; the one I desired. I walk 
over to the phone, call Lily, and someone answers.

&quot;Hello?&quot; her dad asks.

&quot;Hi, this is Bridget... is Lily home?&quot; I ask.

&quot;Hold on...&quot; I held on for atleast 10 minutes.

&quot;Hi Bridget. What is it?&quot; I want to tell Lily how I feel... I want her 
to know how I love her.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry, Lily... can I tell you something?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay...&quot;

&quot;Aishiteru!&quot; my Japanese lessons are paying off. I know she&#39;s blushing. 
And so did she.

&quot;You... love me?&quot; she asks. I&#39;m suddenly filled with nerve. What if she 
doesn&#39;t love me back?

&quot;Yes... more than just a friend... I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;Not at all! I love you too, Bridgie! You&#39;re my best friend ever!&quot; she&#39;s 
on the verge of tears.

&quot;I want to be more than just your best friend!&quot; Lily giggles, and so did 
I.

Coming clean never felt that good.

&quot;Me, too, Bridgie...! So are we like... dating?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if that&#39;s okay...!&quot; Lily laughs.

&quot;It&#39;s awesome with me, Bridgie!&quot;

We hang up, and I get my diary and my pencil. I flip open the last page.

5/20/06

Dear Diary,

This is the last entry in you that I&#39;m ever making. Today, I made a 
decision that&#39;s going to change my life. I confessed to Lily, my best 
friend, that I was a lesbian. We talked, and now we&#39;re dating. I love 
Lily with all of my heart; if that&#39;s possible. We&#39;re not only best 
friends now, but in love. Aishiteru, aishiteru, I love you, Diary. 
Aishiteru, aishiteru, I love you, Lily. I love you so damn much.

END

A/N: That sucked, I know, but oh well.</pre>
