<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>      &quot;I can&#39;t believe this...&quot; As Isaka pouted in her new cute form, Krystal just couldn&#39;t 
help but gush over her. &quot;Well, Isaka, you&#39;re going to stay this way until I&#39;ve deemed you 
ready to be back to normal.&quot; Right now, Krystal was lying in her bed, holding Isaka in her 
arms. &quot;Why can&#39;t you let me go back?&quot; Isaka gave her the best innocent eyes she could 
muster, but Krystal just shook her head. &quot;Not until you stop attacking random girls.&quot;

      Isaka smiled brightly and shifted in her arms. &quot;Okay... I promise not to attack any 
other girls.&quot; Krystal gave her a strange look. Demons never break promises... &quot;The only girl 
I want is you.&quot; Krystal just rolled her eyes and shook her head. Isaka pouted and snuggled 
up against Krystal&#39;s breasts. &quot;This isn&#39;t fair! How am I s&#39;pose to sedu... sedu...&quot; She 
frowned upon discovering she couldn&#39;t say &#39;seduce&#39;, but she kept going, &quot;How am I s&#39;pose to 
do that if I don&#39;t haf my sexy body?&quot;

      Krystal just giggled and stroked her head. &quot;That&#39;s the point!&quot; She instinctively gave 
Isaka a kiss on the head and turned out the lights. &quot;If you&#39;re a good girl, I&#39;ll let you 
sleep here every night.&quot; Isaka just stared at her in the dark and nuzzled into her breasts 
again. &quot;Okay!&quot; Krystal found it kind of disturbing that even in her soul prison, Isaka was 
trying to seduce her... &quot;It&#39;s kind of interesting that you turned into a little girl.&quot;

      Isaka looked up at her with curious eyes. &quot;I mean, when I&#39;ve used the soul prison 
before, the demons usually turn into dark, gross, base forms... but you turned into a cute, 
innocent child.&quot; She gave Isaka a warm smile. &quot;That means you&#39;re a good person, Isaka. The 
soul prison reflects you, so I guess you&#39;re not as bad as I thought...&quot; Isaka tucked herself 
in under Krystal&#39;s chin. &quot;Good enough to be in my original form?&quot;

      &quot;No... you have a one track mind Isaka...&quot; She let out a sigh, but she could feel the 
demon child snuggle closer to her. &quot;Only because I can tell you&acirc;&#128;&#153;re a wond... a wonder... a 
really good person.&quot; Krystal blushed at the compliment, but said nothing. Instead, she 
looked down to see Isaka staring at her fondly. &quot;Did I embarr... embarra... embarrass 
you...?&quot; Her little 5 year old hand cupped her cheek and Krystal could feel herself get 
steadily flustered. God... a 5 year old was charming into submission and doing a good job.

      Luckily for our unlucky exorcist, her cell phone rang. With a groan, she reached over 
and picked it up. It was her business phone, which meant someone was calling her for 
exorcising. &quot;...Hello,&quot; she answered in best male voice she could muster, causing Isaka to 
giggle. On the other line was Matt Lamet.

      &quot;We... have a problem still. Can you come back? There is seriously something wrong 
with our daughter...&quot; Krystal really wanted to decline, but she did have a follow up 
policy... &quot;Alright, is it an emergency? If so, I can be there in an hour or two...&quot; She 
started getting out of the bed and turned on the light.

      &quot;Yes, yes... that would be great. We&#39;d like to... um, nip it at the bud, so to speak.&quot; 
After a few more lines of dialogue, the man hung up and Krystal started to change. It was 
when she was wrapping her breasts that she felt the intense gaze on her back. She looked 
over her shoulder to see Isaka wide eyed and drooling.

      Krystal let out a long drawn out sigh. Thank God she had used the soul prison... if 
not, she was pretty sure Isaka would have rampaged her twenty times by now. 

***** 

      Two hours later, she was sitting in the Lamets&#39; living room with Isaka on her lap. She 
couldn&#39;t leave the little demon at home all by herself (Isaka was too small to prepare food) 
so the only alternative was to bring her. Matt just gave them a strange look. &quot;Oh, this is a 
girl I&#39;m taking care of for a friend. Just pretend she isn&#39;t here.&quot;

      Isaka just snuggled in to Krystal&#39;s unfortunately flat chest (damn bandages!) and kept 
an ear open to listen. Matt and Melanie exchanged glances before sitting down. &quot;I know you 
checked if the demon tainted our daughter, but,&quot; he said, biting his lip nervously, &quot;...we 
think the demon did something to her.&quot;

      Krystal just nodded, but in the back of her head, she knew exactly what had happened. 
The Lamets had found out about Mina&#39;s love for Eveon. &quot;Eveon and Mina went out on a picnic 
earlier today. Melanie went to drop off something Mina had forgotten and found the two of 
them...&quot; The man just gulped awkwardly. &quot;They were almost kissing!&quot; Melanie blurted the last 
part out and started to massage her temples.

      &quot;I just... don&#39;t know. I love my daughter so much so I don&#39;t understand... Maybe I 
should have paid more attention when she turned down boys or... or how close she and Eveon 
were...&quot; Melanie let out an elongated sigh before leaning into her husband.

      &quot;You have done nothing wrong as parents,&quot; Krystal stood up with Isaka in her arms and 
started to head up the stairs to Mina&#39;s room. &quot;I will examine and take care of both of them. 
Is Eveon at the bed and breakfast?&quot; The Lamets just nodded as the exorcist entered their 
daughter&#39;s room.

      Mina was startled and looked over. Her face was slightly red from crying. She eyed the 
exorcist waringly before letting out a sigh. &quot;Are you here to cure me...? That&#39;s what my 
parents said.&quot; Krystal just pulled the girl off the bed while balancing Isaka in her other 
arm. &quot;I&#39;ll... explain it later.&quot;

      It was then that Mina recognized the demon in Krystal&#39;s arms. &quot;Isaka?!&quot; The demon just 
giggled and Krystal brought a finger to her covered lips. &quot;Shh! I&#39;ll explain later. Right 
now, we have to go get Eveon!&quot; The 14 year old smiled and nodded, but as she was led 
downstairs, she faked a solemn mood. Krystal gave a parting nod to the Lamets and took their 
daughter with her.

      Once they were a safe ways away, Mina asked, &quot;What are you going to do? And why is 
Isaka like that?&quot; Krystal set down Isaka and the demon started to walk on her own holding 
her hand. &quot;I&#39;m trapped in a soul prison and I haf to behave to get back my sexy body.&quot; Mina 
just stared at Isaka before giving her a hug. &quot;You&#39;re so cute as a little kid! Has anyone 
told you that?&quot; Isaka just stared up at Krystal and the exorcist just chuckled.

        &quot;Well, Mina, I&#39;m not here to &#39;cure&#39; you because there is nothing to cure.&quot; Mina just 
gave her a surprised look, but Krystal continued. &quot;Personally, I think it&#39;s kind of... weird 
that you like your friend like that, but it&#39;s love. So, I&#39;m actually here to help you.&quot; She 
sheepishly rubbed the back of her covered head and Mina just hugged her. &quot;Thank you so 
much!&quot;

      They finally reached the bed and breakfast and Krystal knocked on the door. Abby 
opened it up and stepped aside to let them in. &quot;Matt called and told me you&#39;d be coming.&quot; 
The older woman called her daughter down and Eveon&#39;s face went bright red when she saw Mina, 
relieved when she saw the exorcist and confused when she saw the demon.

      &quot;Abby, I&#39;m here to take Eveon and Mina out somewhere safe so I can examine and 
possibly cure the cause of their-&quot; Abby just interrupted her. &quot;If you need a place to 
facilitate their relationship, I&#39;m totally fine with you using this place.&quot; Krystal looked 
surprised. &quot;R-r-really? You&#39;re not upset that Eveon and Mina are...?&quot;

  Abby just shook her head and placed her hands on her daughter&#39;s shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s okay if 
Eveon&#39;s into flowers with flowers.&quot; As soon as she said that, Eveon shouted out, &quot;Mommy!&quot; 
and Mina went bright red as Krystal coughed awkwardly.

      &quot;You don&#39;t say things like that!&quot; Eveon shouted, covering her embarrassed face. Abby 
just sighed and motioned to the living room couch. &quot;Let&#39;s all sit down and have a nice 
chat.&quot; Mina and Eveon sat together on the loveseat, rather awkwardly, while Abby sat on the 
actual couch and Isaka sat on Krystal&#39;s lap on a recliner.

      &quot;Well then, I have no qualms with my daughter liking other girls,&quot; Eveon looked at 
Mina and vice versa before they both blushed. &quot;I mean, your father would be happy for you 
Eveon.&quot; The blonde girl just awkwardly shrugged. &quot;You think so Mommy?&quot; The blonde woman just 
nodded. &quot;Yep, he&#39;s been dead 9 years, but nothing would have made him not love you.&quot;

      Eveon looked considerably happier until she heard the next thing her mother said. 
&quot;It&#39;s perfectly fine that you&#39;re a sexual deviant, I hear you can get special college 
scholarships for it.&quot; There was another round of red faces and a shout of &quot;Mommy!&quot; from 
Eveon.

      &quot;W-well... I&#39;m glad you&#39;re okay with it and I guess I should introduce Isaka here,&quot; 
Krystal said. &quot;She&#39;s the supposed culprit, but I sealed her in the form of a five year old 
so she doesn&#39;t cause any trouble.&quot; Isaka just waved and then grinned deviously at Eveon. 
&quot;Has Mina put the moves on you yet?&quot;

      Eveon just looked awkwardly at Mina and answered, &quot;Y-yeah...&quot; Abby let out sigh and 
smoothed out her long blonde hair. &quot;Goodness, my tomboy of a daughter is the catcher...&quot; 
Eveon just gritted her teeth. &quot;Mommy, is this your way of punishing me?&quot; Abby just smiled 
fondly at her daughter. &quot;Please, I always knew you were like this. You sneak into Mina&#39;s 
bedroom every other day, so just let me have my fun.&quot;

      Krystal fidgeted awkwardly, but Mina broke the tense air. &quot;So, did you seal up Isaka 
at her mansion and take her home with you?&quot; Krystal shook her head. &quot;No, she followed me 
back and jumped me, so I just sealed her up.&quot; Eveon made a face. &quot;Why would she jump you? 
You&#39;re a boy and she&#39;s only into girls so-&quot;

      Suddenly, the three women in the room exchanged glances before staring at the 
exorcist. Krystal could feel Isaka stifling laughter. &quot;YOU&#39;RE A GIRL?!&quot; They shouted in 
unison and Krystal just laughed nervously before taking off the turban and her scarf. &quot;Um... 
hahahaha... it makes my job easier...?&quot;

      Eveon just settled back into the loveseat with a sigh. &quot;I thought you were a sissy, 
but... oh well. At least Isaka can&#39;t do anything since she&#39;s a kid!&quot; The demon glared at the 
14 year old, but Eveon brushed it off.

      &quot;Well,&quot; Abby stood up and stretched. &quot;I&#39;ll go deliver the news to the Lamets that 
their daughter is a lipstick lesbian and my daughter is the submissive ninny in the 
relationship. Ta-ta.&quot; Abby started going out the door leaving a fuming Eveon behind.

      &quot;Oh,&quot; Abby stuck her head through the door. &quot;Eveon, if there&#39;s any missing whip cream 
from the fridge, you&#39;re buying it.&quot; She closed the door just in time to block the shoe her 
daughter threw at her.
