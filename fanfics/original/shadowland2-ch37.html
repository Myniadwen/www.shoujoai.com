<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><pre>&quot;Are you hurt?&quot; Kimberly asked Jessica as she scanned the bruises and 
cuts on the girl&#39;s arms and legs.

Jessica shook her head, &quot;It only hurts a little.&quot; She replied bravely, 
however her eyes said otherwise. They were filled with a terror that Kim 
could hardly comprehend. Suddenly they heard loud thump against the door 
they had just escaped from.

&quot;We need to get out of here?&quot; Kim stated urgently and started towards 
the stairs.

Jessica merely nodded and slowly followed the redhead, her eyes unable 
to pull free of the door as it bulged with the force of each blow to its 
surface. 

&quot;Come on!&quot; Kim took the girl by the hand and started back down the hall 
towards the stairs. She stopped at the stairwell and glanced around, 
something was missing. She scanned the hall to see her stuffed raccoon 
lying in the middle of the hall, &quot;Racky!&quot; She exclaimed and rushed after 
the stuffed animal. Just as she reached for the toy a paw burst through 
the door. Kim could see a small set of claws protruding out of a stuffed 
paw as it ripped at the wooden door of the room which she had only 
recently left Sarah in. Swiftly she snatched up the raccoon off the 
floor and ran back to Jessica, &quot;RUN!!&quot; She commanded. 

Jessica did not wait to be told twice as she bounded down the stair two 
at a time with Kimberly right behind her. A dark silhouette stepped out 
at the bottom of the stairs, &quot;KIM!!!&quot; Jessica screamed as she tried to 
stop her decent. 

&quot;Jessica!!&quot; Kim grabbed the girl by the remains of her shirt and pulled 
her back. The two girls tumbled backward to be seated upon the stairs 
only steps away from the shadowy figure. Kim glanced up the stairs to 
see more shadows gathering at the top of the stairs. They were suddenly 
trapped with nowhere to run. 

&quot;Kim?&quot; A familiar voice called out from the bottom of the stairs. 

&quot;Kima!?!&quot; Kim called back, &quot;Is that really you?&quot; She inquired, for the 
first time glad to hear her twin&#39;s voice. 

Kima started up the stairs with a smiling upon her face, &quot;Kim, I&#39;m so 
glad to find you.&quot; She stated, truly relieve to find her other half, &quot;I 
thought you were right behind me. What happened?&quot; 

&quot;I found Jessica!&quot; Kim explained pointing down at the small child as she 
got to her feet. 

&quot;Jessie?&quot; Kima cocked her head at the child, &quot;Now weren&#39;t you a cutie.&quot; 
She ruffled the girl&#39;s hair. 

&quot;Tease her later.&quot; Kim commanded taking a peek over her shoulder to see 
several stuffed animals working their way down the stairs, &quot;We need to 
get out of here.&quot; She helped Jessica to her feet and the three of them 
hurried down the stairs. 

&quot;Penny?&quot; Kim blinked at the girl who smiled weakly back at her. &quot;Wait... 
Was she in the basement?&quot; Kim inquired uneasily. 

&quot;Yeah...&quot; Kima replied, perplexed by her doubles question, &quot;Why?&quot; 

Kim glanced around, &quot;Where are the other girls?&quot; She asked peering into 
the living room. 

&quot;What other girls?&quot; Kima inquired curiously as she followed Kim into the 
living room, &quot;What are you looking for?&quot; 

&quot;There were several girls living here.&quot; Kim explained as she searched 
the room, &quot;Four of them I think.&quot; She scanned the room when she 
discovered a pile of girl&#39;s cloths in the corner of the room. The cloths 
were yellowing with age and were covered in dust, but looked as if they 
could have been worn by the children she has seen earlier, &quot;They were 
wearing clothes like these.&quot; Kima approached the clothes when Jessica 
pulled on her arm, &quot;What is it?&quot; She glances down at the child.

Jessica only shook her head. There was even more fearfulness in her eyes 
then before and she kept glimpsing down at the pile of clothes. &quot;No...&quot; 
She trembled, &quot;... don&#39;t...&quot; 

Kim stepped away from the clothes. Something about the look in Jessica&#39;s 
eyes told her she would be better off not seeing what was under those 
clothes. Then she notices something peeking out from beneath the pile. 
She lightly kicked at the mass and a small arm rolled out from under the 
clothes, blood upon its fingers, &quot;I... I... I think we should get out of 
here.&quot; Kim stammered as she slowly backed out of the room. 

&quot;Good idea.&quot; Kima agreed and spun around to see a group of long shadows 
moving down the hall, &quot;I do not think those are stuffed animals.&quot; She 
states edgily. 

Jessica suddenly dashed passed the girls across the hall and opened a 
large pair of sliding doors to the dinning room and signalled for the 
other girls to follow. They quickly followed the girl and Kima hastily 
closed the door behind them and locked them. 

&quot;Now what?&quot; Kim asked in distress gesturing at all the windows, which 
had been nailed shut from the outside, &quot;How are we supposed to get out 
of here?&quot; She exclaimed as she spun around in search of another exit, 
and then spotted another door in the far corner of the room, &quot;How about 
that way?&quot; She inquired, starting towards the door when Jessica grabbed 
hold of her by the hem of her dress. 

&quot;N... no...&quot; Jessica stammered and tugged on Kim&#39;s clothes, pulling her 
away from the door. 

&quot;What is it Jessica?&quot; Kim gently inquired, allowing the girl to lead her 
across the room to one of the windows. 

Jessica stuck her tiny fingers between one of the boards of the window 
and pushed. The nailed screeched then released their grip to reveal a 
narrow hole only big enough for a small child to crawl through. She then 
turned to Kim and gave a half smile at her success.

&quot;Good going!&quot; Kim exclaimed proudly and gave the girl a tight hug.

&quot;Great!&quot; Kima rushed over to the window, &quot;I think you can all fit 
through.&quot; She turned to Penny, who was still standing near the door and 
held out her hand to the girl, &quot;Come on Penny.&quot; She offered. 

Penny nervously glanced around the room, &quot;M... my belt...&quot; She commented 
apprehensively and staggering away from the window. 

&quot;Penny we have to go!&quot; Jessica suddenly commanded, &quot;Please...&quot; She held 
out her hand as well, &quot;Don&#39;t make me leave you.&quot;

&quot;Leave her?&quot; Kima exclaimed bewildered by what Jessica was suggesting. 
She glanced between the two girls then back to Kim, &quot;We are still part 
of their nightmare.&quot; She explained. 

&quot;But Jessie.&quot; Penny finally spoke, her eyes darting from the door back 
to the girl, &quot;They will find us. They always do.&quot;

Abruptly there came a loud knocking at the door, &quot;Jessie? Penny?&quot; A kind 
sounding man&#39;s voice called out, &quot;Time to come out.&quot; 

&quot;Penny!?!&quot; Jessica cried and reached out towards the girl, &quot;Please!!! I 
promise they will not find us.&quot; 

Kim wildly scanned around the room then back to her twin, &quot;What do we 
do?&quot; She panicked. 

&quot;Girls?&quot; The voiced drifted through the door, &quot;We know you are in there 
so COME OUT!!&quot; The kindness quickly devolved from the voice and was 
replaced by irritation.

Kima&#39;s mind raced as she tried to think of a way out, &quot;I... I...&quot; She 
bit her lip in worry. 

Jessica&#39;s eyes filled with terror, &quot;P... please...&quot; Her hand began to 
tremble with fear. 

Penny backed into a corner, &quot;N... no...&quot; She mumbled, &quot;They will find 
us...&quot; She sunk into the corner with tears streaming down her face, 
&quot;They will find us...&quot; 

Something heavy slammed against the door, &quot;GIRLS!!!&quot; The voice screamed, 
&quot;You open this door this instant or you are in deep trouble Is That 
Understood?&quot; The voice commanded. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Jessica suddenly ducked through the window and crawled 
out of the house.

Kima quickly turned to Kim, &quot;Go with her!&quot; She pointed at the window. 

&quot;But...&quot; Kim stared at the door as it bulged with the increasing hammer, 
&quot;What about you?&quot; She asked frantically. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be alright.&quot; Kima assured, &quot;You need to get Jessie out of here and 
find Jenn.&quot; 

&quot;But!&quot; Kim hesitated unsure of what to do when a hammer broke through 
the door. 

&quot;GO!!&quot; Kima ordered and pushed her twins head towards the hole, &quot;We&#39;ll 
find another way out.&quot; She stated before shoving the girl out the 
window. 
										
Kim tumbled out of the window and rolled across the grass. She rapidly 
got to her feet and turned to face the window, &quot;KIMA!!!&quot; She called out 
only to find the house was no longer there and she now stood waist high 
in a river of fog, &quot;Kima...&quot; She sunk into the fog as despair gripped 
her heart.
