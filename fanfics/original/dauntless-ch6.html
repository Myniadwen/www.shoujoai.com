<p>“Sargasso:  set sail for adventure!”</p>
<p>Lyara  Tanith had been surprised to see a member of her own family onboard.  True, Aseria was a Sindar and she was a Valar, but they could both  trace their ancestry to a single source, which was more than most of  the other women could say. They rarely interacted, though—mostly  because Lil hogged Aseria’s affections, but also because Lyara  couldn’t get a good emotional fix on her distant relative. Everyone  onboard had their unique shades and she could pick them up with a bit  of concentration, but Aseria was different, and Lyara knew better  than to associate with people who didn’t show up on her “radar”.  They met, spoke, explored the ship, and even ate together, but that  was the extent of their relationship. Lyara kept her distance out of  caution; Lillianne had nothing to do with it (on that note, Lil’s  emotional shades barely even registered in her mind, which enforced  her reason to stay away). How those two were connected was a mystery  Lyara preferred not to solve.</p>
<p>Just  as Alala had summarized her experience with several members of the  crew the other day, Lyara thought about all the feelings and emotions  that radiated from their spirits. She had learned to control this  ability long ago—if she hadn’t, it would’ve driven her mad—so  now she could filter and store them as necessary. But intelligent  creatures could not be defined by one single though or emotion: they  were like rainbows and water-crystals, or labyrinthine tombs of Valar  long dead, or “living symphonies” that can express everything  from darkest depression to highest exaltation. Even someone like  Mink, who rarely broke her impassive expression, had a world of  thoughts and experiences for Lyara to digest.</p>
<p>“Can’t  sleep,” she sighed to herself. It was 0042 hours (12:42 am) and  almost totally silent. The <em>Dauntless</em> emitted a very low, lulling, peaceful hum as it sailed through the  heavens, and there was no activity going on nearby—Lyara’s room  had several hallways surrounding it that acted as dampeners against  sound (one of the reasons she chose that space). Sitting up, she  discovered she was unusually refreshed and aware of her surroundings,  definitely signs of an insomniac. Taking a cleansing breath, she got  out of bed, put a robe on, and padded out her room in her bare feet;  the floor was inviting and pleasant to walk on; the walls favored her  with decorations and delights.</p>
<p>She  remembered the nosebleed she got when she tried to gauge Dr.  Miracle’s level of emotion, but the reaction hardly surprised her.  An entity so indefinable and spectacular could not be expected to  share the same level of personal feeling that other species did. But  on that matter, just what <em>was</em> this creature called Miracle? Where did it come from? Was there a  literal meaning behind the name? What was the extent of its powers?  Lyara thought that Amy Blithe, Miracle’s sweet and innocent  assistant, would know the answers, but she never got the opportunity  to peer into her head. And just where was Lyara going now, in the  dead of night? Did she hope to run into the limping girl, or some  other sleepwalker? Was she just walking to cure her restlessness? Or  was she being “led” somewhere by an outside force, maybe Miracle  itself?</p>
<p>By  now, everyone knew where Amy’s room was and could visit her when  they pleased, though it would be impolite to ask her to return the  favor. Sometimes the crew caught a glimpse of her, wandering around  the kitchen or the lounge room, but she usually stayed in her  quarters, a prisoner of her own handicap. Perhaps Miracle had taken  pity on her and invited her onboard…or else she had been cursed by  Miracle…or maybe Miracle had promised to cure her in exchange for  her service. But enough speculating; Lyara’s midnight exercise had  brought her to the hallway where Amy’s room was, and she stood  poised to enter, uninvited, and interview the mousy girl. Yes—she  would get to the bottom of this. The entire crew had questions  concerning this girl and her powerful master—well, Lyara would be  the one to answer them!</p>
<p>She  only took one successful step before freezing in her tracks. A column  of moving light was just ahead on the opposite side of the hallway,  and it was approaching Lyara slowly. A strange, haunting tune drifted  from the light—whatever it was, the beam seemed to be humming—and  the nearer it came, the higher Lyara’s fears rose. The tip of this  phantasm brushed against the ceiling, its long legs and arms waving  in an eerie dance, the song suffocating her thoughts and breaking her  nerves. Lyara had lived on a rough planet and had commanded some of  the toughest dregs society had ever seen, so the sensation of fear  was totally new to her. It felt like being washed with ice water—a  paralyzing baptism of helplessness and horror. She never believed in  the existence of ghosts before but was quite ready to change her  mind. Just as the specter shuffled closer, almost near enough to  touch—it reached its fingers out hungrily—her muscles finally  remembered their strength and rushed Lyara back to her room, where  she locked the door, buried herself underneath her blanket, and  prayed that she would be protected from that ghastly demon.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Rebecca  Hill may have been shy for a bounty hunter, but she was still a  bounty hunter, taught and raised by her aunt Shandra. With her father  the geneticist gone and her mother stuck working as a waitress, Aunt  Shandra had been the only one available, and she had taken the young  Rebecca under her wing quite willingly. But Shandra had been famous  and strong; Rebecca was a mediocre imitator at best. The only things  she could really do well were modifying weapons and cooking—and  with Chandra hogging the kitchen, wearing naught but an apron, that  only left Rebecca the option of repairing and upgrading the crew’s  equipment.</p>
<p>What  strange fate had thrown six of the most-wanted bounties right at her  doorstep? Rebecca may have been a little naïve, but she was  smart enough to realize, with Miracle’s advertisement worded like  that, more than a few of her coworkers would sport a darker shade of  gray. But six wanted criminals? What made things really bad was that  she couldn’t do anything about it: she had promised Amy and Dr.  Miracle that she wouldn’t start any fights, and Rebecca was a lady  of her word. Once they landed on a planet, however, all bets would be  off and the hunt would begin. But there she was, acting all gung-ho  again: something was wiggling in the back of her mind, telling her  that not everything was as it seemed.</p>
<p>Eve,  Kate, Allegra, Herut, Chandra, and Valti were the criminals in  question. Rebecca only really knew about them through reputation and  rumor; she had mostly steered clear of them out of caution. She knew  for a fact that Valti was a convicted criminal sentenced to the penal  colony of Rennai 6, recently escaped (or set loose) to wreak havoc in  the universe one more, but after seeing her in action on the comet,  her perception was changed a bit. Valti Brignor may be an obsessive  weirdo, but she was completely devoted and enthusiastic about her  work, even going as far as risking her life for progress. She was  also a very playful woman, and liberally used her extra limbs to play  tricks on the others, pinching and tickling when her victims least  suspected it.</p>
<p>Kate  Shepherd had one of the smallest bounties among Rebecca’s six  prospects, and despite her build, she seemed least likely to commit  any sort of atrocity. Rebecca actually tried to befriend her in spite  of her misgivings, but for the longest time, she was too intimidated  to even get near her. Normal-looking women made her bashful enough,  so she could only imagine how being around a colossus like Kate would  affect her. She decided to investigate indirectly, and asked several  of the more discreet girls if they knew anything. All they could say  was that Kate had apparently lived a very harsh life on Utopia, and  considered herself blessed to be away from it. The bounty came from a  businessman who claimed she killed someone close to him, but there  was nothing solid yet.</p>
<p>“I  suppose I should go and talk to her,” she mused. “Shepherd seems  like a decent enough person.” <em>And  of course,</em> she added, <em>I  have to remember that sometimes, people are wrongly accused. Now I’m  ashamed I rushed into all this without even thinking. Aunt Shandra  would be so embarrassed.</em></p>
<p>On  that note, Herut seemed like the last person who would have a bounty  on her head. She and Eve got along very well; they were like sisters  or friendly rivals who shared and compared ideas. Because they were  nigh-inseparable, Rebecca got to speak with both of them at once.  When she interrupted their discourse and penetrated their private  world, both women looked at her like she was a disease or a bug, but  only at first.</p>
<p>“Uh,  listen, I think we all got off to a bad start. I know I said I was a  bounty hunter and all, but I’m starting to think not everyone’s  as bad as I thought.”</p>
<p>“No  kidding,” Eve muttered darkly. She closed her eyes and whispered,  almost in a threatening voice, “In my opinion, you’re chasing  after the wrong people.”</p>
<p>“I  know, I’m sorry,” she replied, not understanding the  implications. “I don’t even know why there are bounties out for  you two.”</p>
<p>“It’s  all Chandra’s fault,” Herut said candidly. “I was just doing my  job when she came along and stole the ship I was working on. The  authorities got the wrong idea and put a price on my head. I would’ve  left that tramp to suffer if I could’ve. If you want to catch her  and turn her in, don’t let me stop you. In fact, I’ll even help.”  She smiled eerily; Eve chuckled and ruffled her hair like a big  sister would.</p>
<p>“Okay,  that’s enough. Chandra keeps us fed and that’s reason enough to  have her around.”</p>
<p>“She  only came for the view,” Herut muttered tartly. She raised her  eyebrow at Rebecca and explained: “She’s crazy about girls. Most  female pleasure units don’t have that anomaly built into them, but  Chandra’s programmer was a little twisted. I’d stay away from her  if I were you. Otherwise, she’ll pursue you until she has you in  her vile clutches.”</p>
<p>“She’s  not that bad,” Eve shrugged. Herut snorted and resumed her work;  the <em>Dauntless</em> had a few minor maintenance problems to work out.</p>
<p>“It  seems she’s already ensnared you. Be very careful around her, Eve.  That stupid whore is a veteran heartbreaker. I wouldn’t want an  intelligent woman like you making the mistake of trusting her. Miss  Hill, that goes for you as well. Stay away if you know what’s  best.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah,”  she whispered. “Uh, so Eve…why is there a bounty on your head?”</p>
<p>“Nothing  special,” she replied unemotionally, her mind off in another world.  “The United Cosmic Military just wants my ass back in their ranks.  Apparently they can’t get over the thought that a talented girl  like me is wandering around wasting my skills.”</p>
<p>“I  see.” Eve Kasberry’s name was renowned across all civilized  corners of the galaxy; she was a celebrity and an idol, and it was no  surprise the UCM was trying to get her to reenlist. Rebecca  immediately understood why she distanced herself from the rest of  humanity: it was the curse of being an icon; they had little privacy  and little time to rest. Being a member of the <em>Dauntless</em> might have been a radical change for Eve, but here, she could at  least relax and be herself for a moment.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Rebecca  no longer felt it was necessary to hunt down any of the people with  prices on their heads. It wasn’t as if they had all convinced her  they were “good people” or “misunderstood”, she could just  understand their situations to a degree. Many of them had been trying  to do the right thing, or were just living their own life, when fate  dealt them a bad hand and put them on the other side of the law. Some  were even wrongly-accused or totally innocent. Rebecca herself once  had people out looking for her; she remembered being the cause of a  certain bigwig’s ire and was grateful she had gotten out of that in  time. From her perspective, she shot him out of self-defense; from  his, it was an attempted murder. How many other points of view needed  to be explored before the journey came to an end?</p>
<p>She  still hadn’t interviewed Allegra, but the excitable gunslinger was  going off on a mission. The Acheron sisters had spotted the  semi-civilized world of Sargasso, named after a sea in Helios 3, and  a small team volunteered to explore and search it for valuables,  Allegra being one of them. Rebecca did get the chance to tell her she  wanted to talk, but she tried being as nice about it as possible.</p>
<p>“Well  sure, sug,” replied the belle, her southern American accent  refreshing. “I still haven’t made as many acquaintances as I  wanted to, so I’d be glad to pay you a visit. In fact, why not come  with us? I hear you’re one tough gal.”</p>
<p>“No,  it’s all right,” she replied. “You have enough people going  with you.” Kate was going along as well, saying she wanted to  stretch her limbs and breathe fresh air again. The two swordswomen,  Athena and Sharyn, were also tagging along, and that meant Dr.  Fujiwara was following. They were about to descend the ramp when a  copper-shaded person streaked by, shoving everything out of her way.</p>
<p>“Not  so fast! Where do you think you’re going? Nuh-uh, not without me! I  signed up for this damned cruise and I might as well get something  out of it! You’re taking me and that’s final!” It was Naja  Elapidae, civil and considerate as always.</p>
<p>“Oh  my,” Allegra blushed. “Sounds like a beetle crawled up your  backside.”</p>
<p>“Don’t  even think about setting foot in that shuttle,” Fuuka hissed  venomously. She glared daggers at the serpentine woman. Not one to be  pushed around like that, especially by a frail little fox-girl, Naja  rolled up her sleeves and marched over, lashing her tongue out like a  whip.</p>
<p>“You  did <em>not</em> just tell me what to do.”</p>
<p>“I  most certainly did. Snakes are abominable creatures and should be  slaughtered en masse.”</p>
<p>“You  fucking worthless piece of shit,” she hissed, her voice low and  deadly, “do you even know who you’re dealing with?” Athena  stepped in between the two and glared icily at Naja. Half an hour  ago, she wouldn’t have given her a second thought, but anybody who  spoke to Fuuka like that was asking for it.</p>
<p>“Step  away from my Fuu-chan if you don’t want to be cut down.”</p>
<p>“And  who’s gonna make me, bunny-girl? You? Gimme a break! I eat your  kind for supper! Yeah, that’s right—and I eat bitchy little  fox-girls for breakfast.”</p>
<p>“You’re  the only bitch I see here,” she replied coldly. Kate suddenly came  between them and shoved them apart with her powerful arms.</p>
<p>“All  right, that’s enough. You both agreed not to fight while you’re  on this ship—“</p>
<p>“So  let’s take this to the surface and settle everything!” Naja  chuckled.</p>
<p>“Fine  by me,” Athena said.</p>
<p>“You’re  all about as ornery as weasels in a wiffle pot,” Allegra observed.  “First of all, I don’t think it’s fair to talk to a perfect  stranger like that. Y’all don’t know each other one lil’ bit;  it’s ignorant to cast the rod before you know there are any fish in  the lake.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”  Naja blurted. Everyone else looked equally baffled, but luckily, a  diplomat was passing by and decided to intervene. Rebecca’s cheeks  turned deep pink as she saw Riene step in; she had a considerable  crush on the older woman but couldn’t bear to be open about it.</p>
<p>“Excuse  me. I think what Allegra means is that you shouldn’t discriminate  based on appearance. Now let’s not go anywhere until we’ve  settled this. Doctor, why do you hate Naja so much?”</p>
<p>“She’s  a snake,” she growled, narrowing her once-gentle eyes. “I loathe  snakes.”</p>
<p>“Um,  okay, but is there any other reason?” She shook her head.</p>
<p>“See?”  Allegra pointed. “I told her she was actin’ childish.”</p>
<p>“Allegra.”  Riene placed an alleviating hand on her shoulder, and the gunslinger  quieted down. “Doctor, if you merely hate someone based on  appearance or species, I’m afraid you’re nothing more than a  racist. Naja, you have every right to be angry, and that’s a  perfectly healthy response in this situation, but that doesn’t  justify violence. You might just want to stay here while they go.”</p>
<p>“Or  they could stay here while I go,” she countered. Riene nodded.</p>
<p>“True.  It’s clear to me that you will be unable to coexist, so those are  your only options.”</p>
<p>“And  you’ll have to nail me to the floor to keep me here,” Naja  sneered, feeling triumphant. Athena just shrugged.</p>
<p>“Sounds  good to me. Fuu-chan, where do you keep that emergency hammer?”</p>
<p>“Athena.”  The warrior-rabbit was not a good person to cross, and Riene was  really showing how gutsy she was by standing up to the intimidating  woman. Fuuka saved Riene any grief by enveloping her companion’s  arm and drawing her away.</p>
<p>“We’ll  wait for the next one, then. Miss Hill, as I recall, you were waiting  for the number of volunteers to decrease. Your patience seems to have  paid off. Please take care of the others—and if you like, feel free  to leave this venomous worm behind.”</p>
<p>“What’d  you say, ya little cunt?!”</p>
<p>“Enough,”  Kate said, holding her back. Naja was a powerful woman in every sense  of the word, but Kate had brute strength in spades, and restrained  her just long enough for Fuuka and Athena to disappear. Poor Rebecca  looked ready to pass out from all the stress.</p>
<p>“Methinks  this but a preview of troubles to come,” Sharyn muttered.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Even  though the <em>Dauntless</em> landed on Sargasso, not everyone wanted to disembark and explore the  world. Most of the crew was still getting their bearings, while  others professed they would be happily occupied onboard with their  own adventures. In the end, only six people left the ship to look  around, taking a small transport so they could cover more ground.  Naja had already started to throw her assertiveness around and made  sure the other women respected and feared her. She wasn’t  aggressive and arrogant just for the sake of being; she had merely  been raised to be as strong as she could, to crush the weak—even if  was her own family—and to become as powerful as possible, no matter  what it took. Therefore she looked down on most races, and since the  only things she respected were strength and authority, she didn’t  have a high opinion of her coworkers.</p>
<p>Sharyn  admired her, though, since their hearts were essentially after the  same thing. Because she had not yet received her official title of  Knight, she was eager to prove herself and sought to achieve  greatness and glory, often at the expense of her unstable emotions.  Whenever she was bolstered with confidence in her abilities, she  always tended to rush in, believing everything would work out for  her—but whenever she wallowed in doubt, she was too distracted by  her feelings to be of any good. Even so, she had attracted Naja’s  attention, and they formed the beginnings of a kinship as they  explored the world.</p>
<p>“Anybody  here know anything about this place?” Allegra asked. For all her  bluster, Naja had very little knowledge about outside worlds, and  Kate and Sharyn were even more uninformed. Riene closed her eyes and  recited what she knew:</p>
<p>“Sargasso,  third planet in the Arobless system, classified as a solid planet  suitable for the majority of intelligent species, civilization level  4, and population estimated at fifty-thousand. Discovered in 2509 by  a Gaian explorer who named it after a sea on Earth—not knowing that  ‘Sargasso’ meant <em>kelp</em> in Spanish—it remained undeveloped for nearly eighty years,  occasionally visited by wayfaring travelers. Reports indicate that in  spite of its low population, Sargasso has fertile soil and adequate  resources, though it could not compare to more modernized worlds.  Because so little is known about it, there may very well be treasures  here.”</p>
<p>“I’m  impressed,” Naja said. “Do you have a little library in your  head, or are you just that smart?” Riene turned red and laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh  no, nothing of the sort—I just did a little research beforehand.  I’ve been spending most of my time in Miracle’s library.”</p>
<p>“Oh.  Well, that’s an admirable trait to have. I like someone who  approaches their work prepared.” She smiled silkily; Riene felt her  heart flutter. Naja’s ferocity and independence had made her an  incredibly attractive woman on Jelrin, and it carried over very  successfully when she traveled abroad. Riene was particularly drawn  to strong women and was flattered that one of the Elshyrin elite  found her attractive. Poor Rebecca observed all this with a tied  tongue; she couldn’t bring herself to butt in and was shamed by her  cowardice.</p>
<p>“Perhaps  Gwen and I could be of some use.” Sharyn had been unusually quiet  the whole trip, so when she spoke up, people listened. Nobody noticed  the spherical little monitor droid floating at her shoulder, and they  were surprised that someone so primitive could carry around a piece  of advanced technology like that. “Gwen,” said the knight-errant,  “we are seeking the treasures of Sargasso. I beg thee to lend us  thy aide.”</p>
<p>NO,  chirped the machine. Sharyn’s red hair seemed to frizz in  irritation.</p>
<p>“Eh?  Wherefore? This stubbornness becomes you not, Gwen.”</p>
<p>YES.</p>
<p>“Is  that all this lil’ critter can say?” Allegra wondered as she  cradled the floating orb.</p>
<p>YES,  it replied, startling her.</p>
<p>“Not  all that eloquent, are you? But why aren’t ya helpin’ us out?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps  my kin instructed it too well,” Sharyn sighed as she called Gwen  back. “My familiar hath but one task—to record and judge my  actions so that my worthiness may be determined. We can interact with  each other, and she may answer simple questions, but on the whole,  I’m left to fend for myself.”</p>
<p>YES.</p>
<p>“That  sucks,” Naja sighed as she grabbed the orb and played with it.</p>
<p>NO.</p>
<p>“Shaddap!”</p>
<p>NO.  Riene laughed.</p>
<p>“Spirited  little thing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>YES.  Kate gradually stopped the transport and raised a hand to silence  everyone. There was a very large hole in the ground, almost big  enough to drive in, and as the team got out to investigate, they  could see a path that wound around the outer edge, like a spiral,  descending so far down that they could not see the bottom, even with  a light.</p>
<p>“I  hath a negative sentiment concerning this scenario,” Sharyn  whispered.</p>
<p>“A  what?”</p>
<p>“A  bad feeling,” Kate explained. She wanted to be the first to go down  the hole—for surely this would lead them to an adventure—but  Sharyn beat her to the punch, chivalrously leading the way with Gwen  acting as a lantern. Naja was more than happy to let someone else get  ahead of her—she knew whoever walked in front was usually the first  one taken down—but she didn’t dare sacrifice her second-place  position. The Elshyrin frequented canyons and mines kilometers deeper  than this little scratch in the earth, so she was actually bored long  before they reached the bottom, and the light of the surface was  reduced to a single pinprick in the sky. Several members of the team  experienced vertigo and acrophobia the deeper they went, and a few  wondered if they would be buried alive. Naja decided that, for the  sake of morale, she would have to be leader from now on.</p>
<p>“C’mon,  stop being a bunch of toothless old women! You—the redhead with the  sword! If you want to be a knight, you’ll have to face dangers a  hundred times greater than this! And you, bounty hunter! Grow a spine  and stand tall! Well, at least there are three people here who aren’t  afraid!” Kate merely shrugged—to her, this suffocating darkness  was child’s play compared to the horrors of her home world—and  Allegra looked like she was actually having fun.</p>
<p>“You  kiddin’? A real lady shows no fear. This reminds me of Mammoth Cave  in Kentucky. Well Gwen, let’s get this show on the road!”</p>
<p>YES.  Allegra and Kate bravely followed Naja, leaving the others behind to  marinate in envy. Naja may have been the universe’s biggest  bitch—and a powermonger—and a ruthless warrior—and a moody  companion—but they couldn’t deny her spirit and determination.</p>
<p>“I  have so much to learn,” Sharyn sighed as she followed her impatient  familiar. Riene and Rebecca were glad it was so dark down there,  because otherwise, they would’ve been ashamed to show their faces.</p>
<p>“Let’s  not be left behind. Hold onto my arm so we don’t get separated.”</p>
<p>“Good  idea.” This was no time to be flustered; the fear and thrill of the  moment was too great.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Naja  was in truth a very quiet, distant, moody individual, but she had a  volcanic temper and did not tolerate any of the following (according  to <em>The  Manifesto of an Independent Elshyrin Bound for a Higher Calling</em>,  which she wrote and published): incompetence, laziness, stupidity  (“People are born ignorant, but they <em>choose</em> to be fools”), cowardice, weakness, misguided sympathy, inattentive  behavior, and worst of all, optimism (“Nothing ruins a rational  mind faster than the belief that everything is for the best”). On  the other hand, she had great admiration for the strong and the  superior, and had to admit that most of her new contemporaries were a  good match for her, or better—especially Kate, whom she was  infatuated with.</p>
<p>With  darkness surrounding them, penetrated only by the feeble light given  off by Sharyn’s monitor droid, it gave the six travelers time to  reflect and think. The cavern moaned as the wind funneled in from  above, its howls echoing through the emptiness until it gave the  women the sensation of exploring through a monster’s belly. Sharp  rock formations shaped like teeth strengthened the impression of  being inside a mouth of sorts. It was dark and a little moist, but  the ground was solid and the air was quite fresh, and no living thing  scurried in that other world besides the travelers.</p>
<p>“How  long do you think this goes on?” Rebecca whispered, not wanting to  risk any noise. Of course, her feeble voice wouldn’t have brought  the entire earth crashing down on them, but this didn’t comfort her  concerns in the least. She was used to wide open spaces and bright,  cheerful sunshine, so this was all a shock to her. Riene still had  her hands around her arm, though, and even though she was still  afraid, at least she was in good company.</p>
<p>“How  should any of us know?” Naja grumbled. “It goes on as far as it  goes on. Maybe a few more meters, maybe all the way to the other side  of the planet. Don’t ask stupid questions.”</p>
<p>“I’m  just saying that if we don’t find anything after awhile, we should  give up and turn around.”</p>
<p>“That’s  no fun!” Allegra whined. “We just got down here and now you wanna  go back? Don’t be such a yellow-belly!”</p>
<p>“She’s  got a point, though,” Kate said. “We don’t have the luxury of  time here. There might be a mutiny if we dawdle too long.”</p>
<p>“They  can all just keep their britches on and wait,” Allegra said  sharply. “Someday they’ll be in our exact same position and then  we’ll—why hello, I declare we’ve run smack into our  destination. Here’s your treasure, Becky darlin’.” Allegra  smiled proudly and presented the object they had apparently been  working towards all this time—only rather, it was a golden door  with a single enormous knocker. There were beautiful decorations  carved into the gold, one of them resembling a blooming lily, another  a swirling sun, one a rush of waves, and another an animal stooping  to drink. It was, in total, a pastoral scene, etched forever on this  portal, though nobody knew what it portended, and there were no other  markings or messages. Sharyn caressed it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Perhaps  this golden portal is the treasure, left behind by the race that  constructed the path we’ve left behind. But should we take such a  valuable item?”</p>
<p>“I  say go for it,” Naja said.</p>
<p>“But  then it’d be mine since I found it,” Allegra pointed out. Naja  tensed up, ready to fight for her share of the prize…but she  reasoned it wouldn’t be worth it, since she was bound to run into  bigger and better prizes. It reminded her of the story where two  foolish Elshyrin boys went into a fancy restaurant begging for  scraps, only to find out later that all first-time visitors received  a free gift basket. This door—if it could even be removed, let  alone carried all the way back to the ship!—was beneath her, and so  was fighting for it.</p>
<p>“It’s  yours,” she chuckled, “providing you can carry it out.” Allegra  gestured casually and pulled on the knocker with all her might, but  with no success. Kate gently shoved her aside, gave it a timid yank,  and the door tumbled into her arms. It was really more like a giant  slab than a door; it had been put up to seal a hole, or so it seemed.  Sharyn sent Gwen inside to investigate, but the little droid zipped  back out after only a few seconds.</p>
<p>NO,  NO, NO, NO, it droned. Sharyn snatched it out of the air, her  greenish face pale with concern.</p>
<p>“Didst  thou perceive a disturbance, Gwen?”</p>
<p>YES.</p>
<p>“A  danger, a threat?”</p>
<p>YES.</p>
<p>“Perchance  an abominably large monstrosity kept sealed here by yon golden portal  for epochs, cursed by the Sargassoans to live in this underworld, now  released by our careless hands to exact its vengeance pon’ the  land?!”</p>
<p>Gwen  took a moment to process this information.</p>
<p>NO.  Rebecca wiped the sweat from her brow.</p>
<p>“Whew,  I was concerned there for a min—“ Her eyes bulged as she saw an  abominably <em>normal-sized</em> monstrosity kept sealed by the golden slab (and so on), and screamed  out the most sensible thing anybody ever heard.</p>
<p>“RUUUUUUUUNNNNN!!”</p>
<p>YES.</p>
<p>“SHUT  THAT THING UP, KNIGHT-GIRL!!” The mad dash for the surface felt  like a blur. Riene fell behind at once, being the one least  accustomed to running, but the thrill of fear spurned her to speeds  she was unfamiliar with: she could feel the hot breath of the  creature blasting against her back, and her skin crawled as she  imagined those long, terrible teeth clamping down on her, ripping her  apart. Allegra and Rebecca valiantly made sure she was not left  behind, and even tried to fire at their pursuer, though it was too  dark to tell if they were making any headway. The ground trembled as  it chased after them, though, so it wasn’t defeated yet. Sharyn  made it back to the spiraling passage first, and turned a very dark  shade of green as she realized they would all have to climb back up  with that monster in pursuit.</p>
<p>“Fly,  fly! Milady, how art thou faring?” She reached out to help Kate,  but the heavyworlder was as strong as the stories described. Even  with that immense slab of pure gold in her arms, she had not slowed  down in the least.</p>
<p>“A  little winded,” she admitted as she placed the treasure down. She  glanced up the hole and groaned. “This’ll be the end of me. We  may have to make our stand here.”</p>
<p>“I  am ready to defend you all.” She drew her sword, ready to fight,  her concentration focused so sharply that her eyes glittered like  daggers. She heard Rebecca and Allegra shooting—Riene was  approaching the passage now, almost ready to crumble in  exhaustion—and sheathed her weapon so she could be of better use.  “Lean against my shoulder, milady. We shall climb this hole  together. Lady Katherine, perhaps ye should endeavor the others for  aid.”</p>
<p>“You  mean ask them for help?” Utopians were hardly flowery  conversationalists, and so like the majority of the crew, she  couldn’t understand Sharyn’s odd language—but she got the gist  of it, and she could see how her eyes implored. “I’ll be all  right. It’s not heavy, just awkward to carry.” Naja suddenly  rushed to join them, flustered and irritated. She stated she had  tried fighting the creature, but she could not see properly in that  light and had been overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“I  kept bumping into shit and tripping everywhere!” she snapped. “It’s  not strong, just brutal and stupid, and it takes advantage of the  surroundings. Haven’t you hauled that thing up yet?”</p>
<p>“Easier  said than done,” Kate grunted. Allegra and Rebecca were still  fighting the creature, so Naja ordered Sharyn to get moving while she  went to Kate’s rescue. She no longer wanted anything to do with the  garish treasure and actually cursed it a few times as she lifted the  other end, but she liked Kate and respected her abilities. Their  destination was a microscopic speck of light in the sky, as distant  and cold as a star, but even under the best circumstances, carrying a  large golden slab up that precarious spiral would be fiendishly  tricky. They had a beast to contend with now, and darkness, and the  weariness that was beginning to set in everywhere. Riene was still  trying to catch her breath, Sharyn trudged up the path carrying her,  Allegra and Rebecca were fighting their enemy—in pitch blackness,  no less—and Naja and Kate had to lug up the gold.</p>
<p>“We  should really just throw this thing away!” growled the Elshyrin.  The slab was as heavy as it looked, and even with Kate helping on the  other end, it felt like carrying a piano.</p>
<p>“I  heard that!” Allegra shouted—she was drawing nearer, which meant  the fight probably wasn’t going well. “Do you really want to give  up after all the trouble we went through?”</p>
<p>“It’s  the trouble that bothers me!” she answered harshly. Progress was  slow, but Allegra and Rebecca swept in to help, one taking the golden  slab and the other helping carry Riene. The beast was too large to  follow them up the path; it had to crawl very carefully and cling to  the narrow surface with its claws. About halfway up, the team picked  up their pace as Riene recovered, apologized for being such a burden,  and the slab’s weight was distributed by everyone. They made it  back to the surface, hurled the golden nuisance on the ground, and  gasped for air. The brightness was overpowering; the openness was  delicious; the freedom was magnificent. Even Naja smiled.</p>
<p>“You  damn humans…you’ll be the death of me before long.”</p>
<p>“I  seem to recall you insisted on coming,” Riene teased. Naja glared,  but didn’t have the strength to fight. Before they could retrieve  their prize and carry on with the mission, the creature leaped out of  the hole, whining at the merciless sun, insane with rage and  vengeance. The women could see it for what it was in the glory of the  light, and a few gushed: it was like a bear and a raccoon and a sloth  all at once, large and furry and just a little bit innocent-looking.  Its coat was a very pale creamy-brown, and there was a dark spot  around its two large doleful chestnut eyes that glittered in the sun.  The beast had a stubby tail and a predator’s claws, and could stand  on its hind legs, though it chose to run on its forearms. One felt  that if it were a cub, one could cradle it in the arms and snuggle  with it, but the adults were fiercer and could potentially slaughter  dozens.</p>
<p>“It’s  so cute!” Kate gushed. Naja drew a blaster and fired; the beast  slumped over, its forehead smoking. Shepherd gasped and nearly ran  over to nurse the animal back to health. “You murdered it!”</p>
<p>“Yeah?  That was to pay it back for all the grief it’s caused us. Damn,  what a friggin’ waste of time!”</p>
<p>“Lay  off, would you?” Rebecca said quietly. “Nobody forced you to come  along, and I know you had fun.”</p>
<p>“Don’t  put words in my mouth, human.” Allegra couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“Awright,  that’s enough feudin’. Kate, you were a real help back there, so  I want you to have this treasure.”</p>
<p>“But  you found it first,” she argued. Allegra grinned and winked at her.</p>
<p>“Well  yeah, but I figured you earned it. I only found it, but you helped  carry it out.” Her face turned red and she smiled timidly.</p>
<p>“I…don’t  know…but if that’s what you want. I’ve never had a treasure  before.”</p>
<p>“Consider  this the first of many, Miss Shepherd.”</p>
<p>“Uh,  I hate to interrupt this flowery moment between you two, but…”  Rebecca pointed behind them, shivering in fear. The creature was  standing up again, now angrier than before. Naja cursed, threw her  blaster away, and marched over to finish the job.</p>
<p>“You’ve  pissed me off for the last time, you flea-ridden furball! I’m gonna  show you what happens to people who cross the mighty Naja!” She  thrust herself at the beast with all the speed and power her species  afforded, baring a pair of infamous Elshyrin fangs. She plunged them  into the beast’s neck and clung on tightly, a force of raw power  that could bend steel bars and shatter concrete. The venom seeped  into the beast’s bloodstream and destroyed it from the inside out.  It groaned in pain, but Naja held fast until at last, the creature  stopped moving and became still. The tender-hearted women felt sorry  for it, even though it had been their adversary, but their job was  complete and the treasure was theirs.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Since  there had been no mutiny as Kate feared, the explorers were welcomed  back to the ship and asked that their story be told. Naja didn’t  like people gushing over her for all the wrong reasons, so she  slinked away to the sauna, hoping that a nice long dip would cleanse  her mind and soul. She was sure that Riene and Rebecca would feel the  same way—how absolutely adorable shy girls were!—and maybe they  would enter the hot tub as well, hopefully in the mood for a  little…fun. Better still, what if Kate came by? Naja brimmed with  anticipation as she let her imagination wonder. With a crew this  mixed, any visitor would be interesting for a few moments, even the  ones that would no doubt annoy her in the future.</p>
<p>“This  is actually a nice bath,” she admitted with a smile. “Miracle may  be obnoxious, but they sure do know how to spoil their guests. I just  wish I knew more about them so I could learn where they got all that  power.” She submerged once, twice, three times, soaking her glossy  dark-brown hair. It felt nice to let it float so freely in the water;  it was normally squeezed up tight in a little military-style  ponytail. Too bad she would have to lose most of it in five days when  she molted her old skin…</p>
<p>“Naja,  you in here? Where’d that lil’ critter go? Naj—oh, there y’ar.”  She emerged from the water just in time to see Allegra hovering above  her, a bright smile on her face and a bundle in her arms. “Sorry to  bother you like this, but Kate wanted you to have this, and she ain’t  gonna take no for an answer.” She placed her bundle down next to  Naja’s garments, unfolding the wrapping to reveal a chunk of the  golden door they had pilfered. Naja raised her nose and snorted.</p>
<p>“I  don’t want it, and I don’t want your pity.”</p>
<p>“Don’t  you be startin’ up any trouble now!” Allegra pointed. “That  woman split it up between all of us, and the least you could do is  appreciate her generosity. C’mon, you were a big help back then.  This is the least we can do to repay ya.” Naja still felt a little  stuffy, and crossed her arms as she grudgingly nodded her head.</p>
<p>“It’s  so ugly and small—more trouble than it was worth. But I guess if  she wants me to have it so badly, it’s her loss. I dunno what I’d  do with it, though, except maybe sell it.” Allegra laughed and  winked.</p>
<p>“Attagirl.  Well, I’ll be outta your way now. Sorry I burst in on you like  this. I like your skin!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  get used to it,” Naja warned her as she left the sauna. “I shed  it twice a year and it’s about ready to go now. Allegra!”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”  Naja stood up, completely at ease with her exposed body, and shouted  out to the gunslinger:</p>
<p>“Word  of warning, hillbilly: once I start shedding, it’s no more Miss  Nice Naja. Make sure everyone knows so they don’t accidentally wind  up on my bad side.”</p>
<p>“Will  do, and thanks!” Naja returned to her bath and held the chunk of  gold in her hands. She smiled faintly, chuckled, and put it away.</p>
<p>“There’s  more to this crew than I thought. They’re not <em>completely</em> useless, I guess.”</p>
