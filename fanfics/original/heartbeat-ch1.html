<h1>Heart Beat</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kyriel.html">Kyriel</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Heart beat, like a soft drum pumping my blood through my veins. She 
stands before me, her eyes gleaming in the darkness her shallow breath 
quick and uneasy. I feel a hand caress my cheek and I step closer. An 
arm wraps around my waist now and I rest my head on her shoulder; soft 
but firm, just like always. 

&quot;Run away with me,&quot; she whispers softly in my ear, I shudder at the 
sensations and kiss my way up to her neck.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t be able to,&quot; I reply my voice shaky with emotion. She runs a 
hand through my hair and presses her lips to my cheek. I stand still, 
not wanting to move in fear of losing precious contact, after minutes of 
just being held, her lips seek out mine and I shudder delightfully as 
her tongue slips into my waiting mouth. She takes a step forward and I 
gently fall to the bed, with her above me. In the darkness I can see her 
smile and I gently trace the line of her jaw with my finger tips. 

&quot;No one&#39;s stopping you, we could be happy forever,&quot; she whispers and 
begins to unbutton my blouse, I sigh and roll my head back, she lowers 
her face between my breasts and places gentle kisses there. I moan 
lightly and stroke her hair. 

&quot;Nothing lasts forever,&quot; I mumble more to myself; staring at the 
ceiling, but she hears anyway and looks up.

&quot;Don&#39;t say that...it&#39;s not true and you know it...&quot; her eyes close and 
she rests her head on my chest, &quot;I&#39;m leaving tomorrow, I want you to 
come with me,&quot; she whispers. My whole world stops. 

&quot;You&#39;re leaving? But...&quot; tears spring to my eyes and I look at her 
sadly.

&quot;But you can come with me, and we&#39;ll be together&quot; she reassures and 
kisses my forehead. I move away from the contact and sigh.

&quot;You could have told me sooner.&quot; She frowns and rolls of me sitting on 
the edge of the bed. 

&quot;I should go,&quot; she whispers remorsefully and stood to leave, I reached 
out and grabbed her wrist pulling her back towards me. She smiles weakly 
and dips her head down to capture my lips with hers. She pulls back 
slowly.

&quot;Will you come with me?&quot; she asks.

&quot;I can&#39;t, I have my family here and they wouldn&#39;t appreciate my leaving 
with you,&quot; I say desperately, the truth is I&#39;m not brave enough to leave 
the comfort of my small town, &quot;Why are you leaving anyway?&quot; I ask sadly, 
she kisses me softly as if to silence me and I let her, wrapping my arms 
around her shoulders and pulling her closer, she wraps her arms around 
my waist and holds me in her gentle embrace. 

&quot;I want to get out of this sleepy town and see other places, spread my 
wings, I want to breathe again, and leaving is the first step...but 
breathing would be so hard without you,&quot; she says after long moments of 
silence. I sigh. 

&quot;What will I tell my parents if I leave? It&#39;s not like they approve of 
us or anything,&quot; I ask quietly, moved by her speech, yet terrified, 
she&#39;s deeper than anyone I know. She smiles reassuringly and resumes 
unbuttoning my top. I scowl playfully at her.

&quot;What? Just tell them that you&#39;re old enough to make your own 
decisions,&quot; she says honestly and removes my top completely a 
mischievous smile on her face. 

&quot;I&#39;m only eighteen, they&#39;ll disagree wholly and you know that just as 
well as I do,&quot; I struggle to say as she nibbles her way down to my 
stomach. 

&quot;Mmm, I&#39;m trying to talk to you here, the least you could do is stop 
teasing and reply,&quot; I wail in blissful torment. She smirks and shuffles 
back up to eye level. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she whispers amusedly and takes a strand of my hair between her 
fingers, twisting the red tresses idly. I smile and kiss her nose which 
in turn initiates another passionate kiss, she opens her mouth and her 
tongue intrudes, seeking out mine in her heated frenzy, I grope her back 
as her hand begins to slide down bared flesh, she fiddles with the 
buttons on my jeans. I pull back abruptly and frown. 

&quot;Stop doing that,&quot; I say haughtily.

&quot;All you have to do is tell them that they can&#39;t interfere with your 
decisions,&quot; she says shrugging. 

&quot;But I don&#39;t want to leave,&quot; I lie, and I&#39;m sure she knows it, but I 
can&#39;t find the courage to tell her the truth. 

&quot;Liar... why can&#39;t you be strong for me?&quot; she whispers sadly and I feel 
a tear slide down my cheek and land on the pillow. She wipes it away and 
smiles, &quot;It will be ok, just please...come with me,&quot; she whispers and 
presses her lips to my cheek, &quot;Please,&quot; 

I sigh, she sounds so desperate that I don&#39;t even think before 
answering, &quot;Yes,&quot; I whisper in reply and she laughs brightly. 

I hate myself; will I be able to leave in the end? Tomorrow seems so 
close and yet so far as she kisses me again, my resolve melts. I love 
her. I love her with a strength and power that I didn&#39;t even know I had 
until I met her, and I&#39;d do anything to make her happy. But I&#39;m not as 
strong as she is. 

She removes her shirt and I feel her soft, warm skin pressed to mine, 
and any doubt that I held onto vanishes. She is my safety, how could 
anything possibly go wrong with her by my side, how could anyone stand 
in the way of such an honest, pure, whole love? I&#39;m losing myself to her 
touch now, her arms around my shoulders, her lips on my neck, her skin; 
hot, delicious skin, pressed to mine so firmly. All I can do is sigh and 
let her take me, ravish me. When she kisses, bites, licks, tastes, it&#39;s 
like she&#39;s forcefully ripping moans from my lungs. I want her with me 
always. 

Her hands, her fiendish, mischievous hands travel once more to the place 
I need her most now, my jeans are unbuttoned and carelessly tossed away, 
and her hands continue to roam my skin once more, my underwear too, is 
hurled out of the way and she&#39;s inside me within seconds. My arms pull 
her as close as they can, this electrifying feeling consuming me 
completely. 

&quot;I love you,&quot; she whispers feverishly in my ear, and I feel alive, my 
gasps lost in the nape of her neck. With her, I&#39;ll never have to fear 
anything. 

With her, I can be myself without hesitation. 

&quot;I love you too...&quot;

And in the darkness, with my heart beat, like a soft drum pumping my 
blood through my veins, I give myself to her completely. 


End
