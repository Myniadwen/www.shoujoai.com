<a href="../original/krishinda-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Akira, Genzo, Miki, Anju and Mitsuki ran out into wet, pebble-paved 
street and gathered around the scene before them. Through the time it 
took for the Heaven Slayers to mobilize, the second devil made its 
escape. However it left a trail of blood, which made it easier to 
track it down. Miki, Genzo and Akira kept a look out for the devil, 
whilst Mitsuki and Anju kneeled down to the wife of the now deceased 
man. Mitsuki gently laid her arm around the woman, and drew her into a 
friendly hug.
 
&#147;I&#146;m so sorry for your loss.&#148; Mitsuki said solemnly.
 
&#147;I...I...we...we just came from...my sister&#146;s...party and now...that 
thing...it just...&#148;
 
The wife broke into a fit of sobs, and berried herself in Mitsuki&#146;s 
chest. Mitsuki hugged her again, and let the young woman stay there.
 
Save for the young woman&#146;s tears and the splash of rain on the ground, 
there was total silence. This was it. Akira suddenly felt a wave of 
fear wash over. Not from the devil, but from the fact that this was 
what she had been training for, since she was a kid. She was finally 
going to meet her destiny.
 
Miki was the first to say something.
 
&#147;We need to follow the devil before the rain washes the blood trail 
away, Genzo.&#148;
 
Genzo nodded to Miki&#146;s comment. &#147;Right. Akira, Anju, Mitsuki. Lets 
go.&#148; 
 
Anju and Miki nodded and followed the trail. Genzo then looked back to 
Akira. She seemed spaced out again, but was struggling to control that 
feeling. The ageing master laid his hand down on Akira&#146;s shoulder and 
stared hard at her. 
 
&#147;Are you ready for this, Akira?&#148; Genzo asked. 
 
After a moment to herself, Akira looked up to Genzo and drew an 
arrogant smile onto her face.
 
&#147;Yes sir.&#148;
 
&#147;Good.&#148; Genzo looked over to his granddaughter. &#147;Mitsuki...&#148;
 
The young woman was still crying in Mitsuki&#146;s arms, but after a 
moment&#146;s hesitation, she reluctantly pulled the woman out of her 
embrace and looked sternly but caringly at her.
 
&#147;You have to get inside,&#148; Mitsuki said. &#147;Tell someone about this and 
we will take care of that thing for you. Do you understand?&#148;
 
The young woman didn&#146;t say anything to Mitsuki, just nodded to her and 
quickly dashed into the Tsukiyo Inn. Genzo, Akira and Mitsuki then 
left to face the second devil. 
 
**********
 
Anju and Miki followed the blood trail, and it had led them back out 
into the into the Heichi grasslands. And there, waiting in the wet 
grassy plains, was the second devil. Miki and Anju&#146;s running slowed to 
a halt as the beast loomed over them. Miki took a second to observe 
the creature. It was...big to say the least, almost three feet taller 
than Anju was, a hulking behemoth, bearing a stark resemblance to some 
sort of wild cat. Although, its fur was a dark blue, with a mane of 
russet hair and a few dark bloodstains in it, probably from previous 
kills. The second devil was also on all fours, its huge scythe claws 
occasionally scraping into the ground. Its teeth were still coated red 
from the blood of his last kill, and its musky breath became visible 
through the cold night air. 
 
Anju became aware of the fact that the second devil was staring the 
pair of them down, and that it was ready to attack at any minute.
 
&#147;Miki,&#148; Anju whispered. &#147;Get ready.&#148;
 
Not taking her eyes off of the devil, Miki sharply drew her sword, 
Kotetsuseiken from its sheath at her waist, positioning it in front of 
her defensively.  
 
&#147;Follow up on my attack, Miki.&#148; Anju said. The second of the Twelve 
Dragons began to focus his energy, steadying his feet and adopting a 
very specific fighting stance. After a few seconds, and rush of 
Mana-Ki permeated Anju&#146;s body. With that burst of power, the young man 
ran straight towards the second devil. As soon as he got close enough, 
Anju leapt into the air, a few metres about the hellcat, and clutched 
his outward palms together, gathering up mystical energies drawn from 
the essence of his spirit.  
 
&#147;Mikazuki Gun!&#148;
 
As Anju yelled out his attack, the energy around his palms morphed 
into a crescent shaped energy wave heading directly downhill at the 
second devil. However, the shifty demon seemed to be able to sense 
that attack, and crudely sidestepped it. 
 
But the subsequent explosion provided great cover for Miki, and she 
took that as her cue to assault the devil.
 
Miki ran towards the devil, his vision partially obscured by the 
explosion of the Mikazuki Gun. Just as Miki got close enough to the 
devil without being seen, she performed a sharp slash at it, one that 
was quick enough rend the demons flesh at the face. 
 
Miki slowed to a stop when she got a few metres behind the devil, 
while Anju landed in front of it. The smoke from the Mikazuki Gun 
finally settled down, and the second devil ambled forward, revealing 
the damage done to its face. 
 
Miki had cut open a long, thin gash stretching from the base of its 
shoulder blade to the cheek below his right eye. Although it was 
bleeding, the second devil didn&#146;t seem fazed by the wound inflicted 
upon him.
 
Miki cursed under breath. &#147;I thought I had done more then that...&#148;
 
Whilst Anju was about attack, Genzo, Akira and Mitsuki arrived and 
positioned themselves next to Anju.
 
Genzo walked up to the second of the Twelve Dragons but kept his eyes 
on the devil. &#147;Is everything okay?&#148; Genzo asked gruffly. 
 
Anju nodded. &#147;We&#146;re fine. Miki managed to slice the devil open but by 
the looks of it, the sucker is ready for some more.  I hope your 
miracle child over there is ready.&#148;
 
&#147;Oh don&#146;t worry she is.&#148; Genzo looked behind him. &#147;Akira.&#148;
 
Akira nodded to Genzo, but not before looking back at Mitsuki.
 
&#147;Mitsuki, you have to stay out of the way, okay?&#148; Akira asked 
concerned. Mitsuki sighed at that. She knew that she was no fighter 
but she also wanted to help out in the fight against the devil. Still, 
she couldn&#146;t refuse Akira.
 
&#147;Fine. But be careful, Akira.&#148; Mitsuki said. Akira smiled sweetly at 
her, and ran forwards towards the devil.
 
The devil itself had recovered from its previous clash with Miki and 
was slowly moving forwards towards Akira, Genzo and Anju. Its large 
size affected its speed luckily for the team. As so as Akira got close 
enough, Genzo pulled an ofudu from under sleeve, and held up into the 
air.
 
&#147;Heavenly waters; drown my enemies with a surge of a thousand 
tsunamis!&#148;
 
A vicious tornado of clear water heaved across at the second devil, 
ramming into it with unyielding ferocity and was strong enough to make 
the devil lose it balance. The creature stumbled backwards, and forced 
itself to remain still. Akira drew the Dragon-edge from the scabbard 
over her shoulder, and while the devil was temporarily stunned, Akira 
hacked and sliced at the creature while it was still dazed. However 
the second devil blocked each blow coarsely with its massive claws. 
 
An ushering in her mind forced her to try again, and she did so, 
performing a quick slash at the devil, which was again blocked, almost 
effortlessly.
 
Genzo&#146;s fist clenched in anger. &#147;Akira, concentrate!&#148;    
 
Akira slashed at the devil again. &#147;I&#146;m...trying...&#148;
 
The devil snarled at Akira, as she slowly back stepped from him. She 
couldn&#146;t find a way to break through its defences, furthermore an ill 
wished fear settled inside her from that realization. 
 
With its fearsome gold eyes glowing a bright light, the devil opened 
its wide jaws, reeking of saliva and blood, and a curious energy began 
to generate inside its mouth. Akira started to worry as she saw this. 
She didn&#146;t know how to act. This was the crucial moment for which all 
her training would be based on, yet when it came to the crunch, she 
felt as though she had learned nothing at all.
 
The energy gathering inside the demon&#146;s mouth ceased abruptly, and a 
powerful blast of energy followed after that. Indecision transformed 
into instinct, as Akira quickly dove out of the path of the beam. She 
landed a good metre away from the blast. It had managed to carve a 
long trench into the wet grassland, and the second devil bellowed in 
satisfaction of the results.
 
Akira breathed in quick gulps, pleased to have escaped a swift 
roasting, but scowled in discomfort as she felt a twinge of pain at 
her ankle. It looked like she twisted it with that last stunt. 
 
The devil finished its primal screams and slowly looked back at the 
seemingly helpless Akira. Anju and Miki were prepared to step in and 
help Akira, but Genzo gave them warning looks that forced them to stay 
put. However, Mitsuki watched in horror as the second devil was slowly 
inching its way to a now downed Akira, and was being consumed by anger 
when she realized that nobody was going to help her.
 
Whether it was through love or through foolishness, Mitsuki did not 
know, but the young healer&#146;s feet suddenly did the thinking for the 
rest of her body, as she ran erratically towards her best friend.
 
Mitsuki blocked out the yells Genzo and Miki threw at her, and 
continued to run towards her Akira, placing herself between the young 
knight and rapidly advancing second devil. 
 
Mitsuki spread her arms out in front of her, and tried her hardest to 
block the fear out of her mind.
 
&#147;You can&#146;t hurt her!&#148; Mitsuki screamed. 
The second devil stopped as it reached Mitsuki and Akira, and snarled 
menacingly at the pair of them. It seemed to snort for a second, and 
it leisurely dragged its colossal paw into the air, shamelessly 
flaunting its ivory, blood soaked claws. 
 
Akira&#146;s eyes widened at the seriousness of the situation. The second 
devil was about to attack Mitsuki. Her best friend. Her own weakness 
had put sweet Mitsuki in this position. If only she could have been 
stronger...
 
{Stronger...}
 
~Mitsuki~
 
{Stronger...}
 
~Protect~
 
{Stronger...}
 
~Mitsuki~
 
{Stronger...}
 
~Must protect...~
 
{Stronger...}
 
~I must...~
 
{Stronger...}
 
~I must...protect...~
 
{Stronger...}  
 
~I must protect you Mitsuki~
 
Mitsuki shut her eyes tightly as the second devil&#146;s claw fell towards 
her. She waited for the end, and after a brief few seconds, she then 
realized that it never came. Mitsuki slowly opened her eyes to see 
that Akira was standing protectively in front of her, the second 
devils&#146; claw latched onto Akira&#146;s sword, which was right above her 
head. Akira carefully looked back at Mitsuki, whilst maintaining the 
pressure on the Dragon-edge. 
 
&#147;Mitsuki, are you okay?&#148; Akira enquired.
 
Mitsuki&#146;s smile returned and she nodded happily. &#147;Yes.&#148;
 
Anger settled in Akira stomach when she realized how much danger 
Mitsuki was just in, thanks to this beast. A fierce twinkle glinted in 
Akira&#146;s eyes as she watched the devil. She would never forgive this 
thing, or herself, if anything happened to Mitsuki. Without warning, 
Akira slid her sword away from the second devils claws, and preformed 
powerful and sharp slash again, however this time; it was aimed at the 
demon&#146;s right arm. Mitsuki, Anju and Miki all gasped in shock as the 
attack cut through flesh, muscle and bone; slicing off the second 
devil&#146;s limb. 
 
The second devil let out a screaming roar of pain, echoing across the 
Heichi grassland. A geyser of blood splattered across the wet grass, 
and the disgruntled demon thrashed in its own misery.
 
Genzo smiled at Akira, breathing a small sigh of relief.
 
&#147;Now, Akira. Destroy it.&#148; Genzo ushered.
 
Akira took note, but did not respond. Rather, she gathered her energy 
into the centre of her soul, and tightened every tendon in her body, 
in preparation for the final blow. 
 
Akira closed her eyes, and focused her power, so much so that the 
Dragon-edge was glowing with a bright cerulean radiance. 
 
Akira&#146;s eyes shot open. &#147;Kyoretsuzan!&#148;     
 
A scorching sapphire wave of energy ripped away from the Dragon-edge, 
and expressly hacked into the second devil&#146;s body. The attack sliced 
the demon&#146;s upper torso into two halves, a mighty crash echoing into 
the night as it large body collapsed into the wet grass. 
 
It was dead.
 
Anju, Mitsuki and Miki all looked on in quiet awe at Akira. Her body 
still glowing with Mana-Ki, loosened up a bit, and she quickly 
sheathed Dragon-edge. Akira turned back to Mitsuki, and drew her into 
a loving hug. Mitsuki was still astounded by Akira&#146;s power, but sure 
enough, the blonde let herself be absorbed by Akira&#146;s affections, and 
gently hugged Akira back. 
 
Genzo grinned at a speechless Anju, and walked past the second devils 
corpse, over to the man in question.
 
&#147;So Anju, do you believe me now?&#148; Genzo said huskily
 
Anju&#146;s jaw still slacked. &#147;...She...she just *killed* a devil...&#148;
 
Miki sheathed Kotetsuseiken, and smiled happily at Akira.
 
&#147;Well, she is Hyudo Kusagana&#146;s daughter, after all...&#148;  
 
Akira and Mitsuki ignored the dead second devil and what was being 
said by the others, and concentrated only on each other. Mitsuki 
sighed breathlessly as Akira held her. This was all she could ever 
want.
 
**********
 
In a dark castle, somewhere far away from the Heichi grasslands, Ryuma 
sat on a marble finished throne, smiling darkly. He turned his palm 
over, and looked at it. A small image of a sixth of a circle appeared 
on his palm. Ryuma sneered again.
 
&#147;So she&#146;s killed one of them. Power must be hereditary...Yakuma...&#148;
