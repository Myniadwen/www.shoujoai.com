3:05 pm

            &quot;I&#39;m very glad to hear you&#39;ve finally settled in.  Tell me 
about the place.&quot;

            &quot;It&#39;s...pretty calm here.  It&#39;s far away from my old school, 
so the rumors won&#39;t follow me.  Nobody will know who I am here.  I&#39;ll be 
a complete stranger.  It&#39;s going to be nice.&quot;

            &quot;Hmm, that should help you recover well.  What about the 
surrounding area?  Is it full of life?  Are there many colors?  Are you 
in a place where you can conveniently get to places?&quot;

            &quot;Yes, it&#39;s a very nice apartment.  It&#39;s called &#39;Greendale&#39;.  
There are lots of trees, and it&#39;s very quiet, and there&#39;s even a flower 
garden I can walk in.  The landlord here is very nice.  He just leaves 
me in peace.  Nobody disturbs me.&quot;

            &quot;I see.  Well, you finally seem to have some organization in 
your life.  Uh, the main reason I called is that I&#39;ve had this idea that 
might help in your therapy.  If you&#39;re open to it, I was thinking that 
you could try out for some kind of sports team.&quot;

            She stood perfectly still, breathing carefully, eyes wide 
open and glassy, the phone cradled in her hand.  The idea of interacting 
with people again, after what she did, was as far removed as her old 
life.  She chewed on her lips, hissing softly.

Misanthropic lone wolf, isolated world that cries

Cynical and estranged, left alone with her festering madness

Desire bore pursuit, now her work might bear fruit

Alice Hawthorne

            &quot;No.  I don&#39;t think that would be a good idea.  I&#39;d have to 
pass a drug test, see, and the medication...  Besides, you know, being 
in a group like that, with my condition...  And I&#39;ve have to take it 
every day.  They&#39;d never let me pass.&quot;

            &quot;I can make the arrangements.  Several friends of mine have 
recommended it to their patients, and they&#39;ve all progressed.  I can 
talk it over with somebody if you&#39;re willing to meet me halfway.&quot;

            &quot;But IT might happen again.  I want to, sir, but I can&#39;t.&quot;

            &quot;If you really want something, Alice, you can have it, but 
you have to work for it.  Playing a sport would be very healthy for you.  
It&#39;s great exercise, and it&#39;ll help you regain trust in others.  I can&#39;t 
force you, of course, but it&#39;s my professional opinion that your therapy 
could benefit from this.  I hear Carnegie&#39;s trying to implement a soccer 
program.  You could get in on that.  Think about it, okay?  Keep in 
touch.&quot;

            Alice hung up, pursing her lips, chewing on a nail.  There 
was no way she would do that--no way she could.  A freak like her didn&#39;t 
belong in normal human society.  She took a deep breath and, chewing her 
lip until blood spurted out, she touched her bare wall, leaving a 
crimson kiss.

            &quot;Like blood...amidst the purity...&quot;

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Take Me Under Your Wing&quot;

            Despite Tuesday&#39;s poor turnout, word had indeed spread about 
the new soccer team being started at the fledgling college--it just took 
some time to proliferate.  Gardenia, Robin, and even Odessa were doing 
everything they could to plug the new sport; the players already 
accepted were encouraged to tell their friends, and those on the board 
of directors informed contributors and families that had helped them get 
ahead, weaving promises and hopes for the young.  Chairman Fitzgerald 
was helpless to stop it once word started to spread; all he could do was 
hope that someone would make a huge blunder.  He had respect for 
Rosewood and her ideals, but she had taken the wind out of his sails by 
suggesting such an uncouth way to spend the budget.  He cursed those 
&quot;wishy-washy&quot; members of the board and their susceptibility to idyllic 
euphemisms, but they had spoken and he was powerless, for the moment, to 
take it back.

            One individual who had answered the seductive call of the 
sport had worked until the wee hours of the morning assembling a 
presentation on why she would make a good candidate.  She had been one 
of the first to really hear about it, having picked up the information 
while the board was still debating the use of their budget, several 
weeks earlier.  She kept careful tabs on their decisions as they went 
back and forth, and after it was confirmed that Carnegie would have a 
soccer team and not a music class, she went straight to work (being the 
adaptable type).  By the time she received one of Kathlyn&#39;s fliers, she 
had nearly organized the entire team herself--all on paper, of 
course--and planned to go visit the field the first chance she got.  Of 
course, staying up all night to finish her work took its toll, and she 
spent all of the morning and part of the afternoon in bed.  She came 
down with a mild cold and was instructed not to leave the house, but 
thankfully got over it in time to be there on day two.

            Most students walked, took their bikes, rode public 
transport, or drove cars they were &quot;borrowing&quot; from their parents; she 
had a personal maid chauffer her to the field in a silver Porche 997.  
She was still recovering from her illness, so the maid had to move her 
around in a wheelchair, which she was quite happy to do.  Another woman 
jumped out of the car, frisky and very fashion-conscious, pulling 
custom-made designer sunglasses over her eyes as she went ahead of the 
other two, drinking in everything around her.

            &quot;It&#39;s a gorgeous day,&quot; noticed the woman in the wheelchair.

            &quot;Yes, it is,&quot; the maid said.  &quot;Maria, take those things off 
and start looking.  It&#39;s not that bright out.&quot;

            &quot;I can see just fine, Araya-chan,&quot; she replied smarmily.  
She jerked her thumb and placed a hand on her hip, looking very full of 
herself.  &quot;See, they&#39;re over there.  That must be Coach PK.&quot;

            &quot;Parkin-Katajisto,&quot; the maid sighed.  &quot;Get it right.&quot;

            &quot;But that&#39;s such a mouthful.  &#39;PK&#39; is much nicer.&quot;

            &quot;It is a little breezy, though,&quot; the third woman said, 
paying no attention to their squabbling.  She punctuated this very 
nicely by adding, &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry, were you two saying something?  I 
honestly couldn&#39;t hear a word you said.  Shall we quit wasting time and 
proceed?&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;m ready to go whenever you are!&quot; Maria exclaimed.  
&quot;Araya-chan here is the one holding us up.&quot;

            &quot;Quit calling me that,&quot; she grumbled as she rolled her 
mistress onto the grassy field.  It was cut so meticulously that even a 
wheelchair could get through, but the maid was still concerned.  &quot;I&#39;m 
not jostling you too much, am I?&quot;

            &quot;No, Shiki,&quot; she smiled.  &quot;You know I love it when you push 
me.&quot;

            &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot; she giggled brightly.  Maria rolled her eyes.

            &quot;She&#39;s not the only woman you push around!  Oh, hey, I guess 
we&#39;re not the first ones here.  There are already a few women...and it 
looks like two are having a spat!&quot;  Maria ran over to satiate her 
curiosity, leaving Shiki Araya and her mistress to follow at a more 
prudent pace.

            &quot;Somebody&#39;s full of energy,&quot; the maid commented.  &quot;Maybe she 
should join the team as well.&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re more suited for that!&quot; the mistress giggled.  Shiki 
smiled warmly and curled her finger around her lady&#39;s silky golden hair.

            &quot;My place is by your side.&quot;  As they drew closer, they 
couldn&#39;t help but overhear the conversation several of the players were 
having.  Discerning the coach was quite easy:  she looked older than 
everyone, although not necessarily old, and she also had a take-charge 
glint in her eye that made her stand out.

            &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with seeing who your future teammates 
are,&quot; said a woman about Shiki&#39;s age.  &quot;It&#39;s all for reference, Leena.  
I just want to see what I have to work with.&quot;

            &quot;You mean who you have to work with,&quot; the coach corrected.  
She smiled craftily and turned to face a middle-aged man.  &quot;You know, I 
think I have just the volunteers you need.&quot;  Shiki watched as he clapped 
his hands, smiling broadly as the girl was dragged over to him.  The 
coach--Leena Parkin-Katajisto, she assumed--also summoned a player who 
was doing some warm-up stretches, and requested that she go with him.  
After a minimal debate which Shiki couldn&#39;t hear, the girl gave up and 
got into the man&#39;s car, and soon it was off on the horizon.

            &quot;I hope you know what you&#39;re doing, Arthur,&quot; the coach 
sighed.  Another woman sensed that they had visitors, and approached 
Maria with a friendly smile.

            &quot;Uh, hey there!  I hope you didn&#39;t overhear any of that.  
We&#39;re just trying to, uh...pick up someone that&#39;ll be a little late.  
You did come to try out, right?&quot;

            &quot;Oh no, not me!&quot; Maria laughed.  She stared intently at the 
older woman, studying her height, weight, mass, and proportions, which 
made Kathlyn quite uncomfortable.  &quot;Mmm, you&#39;d be perfect for me,&quot; she 
purred.

            &quot;Err, uh, no thanks!&quot; she blurted.  &quot;I&#39;m sort of spoken 
for!&quot;

            &quot;Not like that!&quot; Maria chuckled, &quot;Although you are really 
cute.  I mean as a model.&quot;

            &quot;Oh.  Well, uh, okay...  So if you&#39;re not here to try out, 
then why are you here?&quot;

            &quot;Support,&quot; she replied, pointing over to the woman in a 
wheelchair.  &quot;Also, I can&#39;t leave those two alone for very long!  They 
may not look like it, but they actually act like nympho rabbits!&quot;

            &quot;Be quiet, Maria!&quot; shouted a woman in a maid outfit.  Maria 
stuck her tongue out.

            &quot;But I&#39;m right, aren&#39;t I?  You and the little princess go at 
it night and day!&quot;

            &quot;You&#39;re describing yourself, baka!&quot;

            &quot;My, isn&#39;t it pretty today!&quot; exclaimed the handicapped lady 
as she rolled ahead, oblivious to her companions.  &quot;This has got to be 
one of the most gorgeous days I&#39;ve ever seen!  But isn&#39;t it breezy?  
There certainly is a lot of HOT AIR around here!&quot;  She reached her hand 
out for Kathlyn to shake; the other woman stoop gaping as she tried 
wrapping her mind around the kind of bizarre relationship these three 
women had.

            &quot;N-nice to meet you,&quot; she murmured.

            &quot;And a great pleasure to meet you, liebkind!&quot;

A frail genius, a phenomenal star doomed to burn out

A woman who faces her grim destiny without flinching

Two lovers eternally by her side, utterly devoted

Freya von Hohenheim

            &quot;Hohenheim?&quot; Kathlyn repeated.  She smirked and said, &quot;Like 
the guy from Full Metal Alchemist?&quot;

            &quot;No.  I get that a lot,&quot; Freya giggled.  She had a 
discernable German accent that seemed to naturally go along with her 
personality.  &quot;If you please, these are my best friends and companions, 
and they&#39;d like to help out with the team.  On my right is Maria 
Maethers, an excellent fashion designer, and behind me is Araya Shiki, 
my personal maid and bodyguard.&quot;

            &quot;We&#39;ve met,&quot; Maria chuckled as she shook Kathlyn&#39;s hands.  
Shiki settled on bowing.

            &quot;The pleasure is mine.  You would not happen to be Coach 
Parkin-Katajisto, would you?&quot;

            &quot;It&#39;s Leena,&quot; said the older blonde woman they had spotted 
before, turning to face them.  &quot;Just Leena, if you don&#39;t mind.  My last 
name got too difficult for most people in this country to pronounce, so 
I just settled on my first name.  Really, I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

            &quot;See?&quot; Maria grinned, poking Shiki in the side.  &quot;Even she 
agrees her name is too complicated!&quot;

            &quot;All right, fine.  Stop pestering me.&quot;

            &quot;You love it!&quot; she gushed, tackling Shiki and groping her 
breasts.  The maid blushed and slapped her away; Freya purred and 
decided to tease her maid as well.

            &quot;She definitely likes being poked, Maria!  I should tell you 
about some of her more sensitive areas one of these days!&quot;

            &quot;My lady, please!  Not in public!&quot;  Freya blinked in 
amazement as she realized the coach and her assistant were listening in 
on their playful banter.  Throats were cleared and apologies were 
quickly made.

            &quot;So, um, how can I help you, Frau Hohenheim?&quot;

            &quot;Oh, yes, that&#39;s right!  I came here for a reason!  Somebody 
must&#39;ve been distracting me!&quot;

            &quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Maria and Shiki protested.  Freya glared 
coolly before resuming.

            &quot;Ahem, yes.  I came here to apply for the football team.  I 
already brought some ideas with me, so if you&#39;d be kind enough to look 
over them and tell me what you think...&quot;

            &quot;Ideas?&quot; Leena said.  She looked down at Freya&#39;s wheelchair, 
then at Freya herself, concluding that there was no way this young lady 
was seriously considering being part of the team.

            &quot;Oh yes.  I was only able to create fifty or so before the 
deadline, but I hope they&#39;ll go over well.  Maria and Shiki were a 
phenomenal help.&quot;

            &quot;Um, listen,&quot; Kathlyn said gently, &quot;it&#39;s not that we&#39;re 
ungrateful.  We&#39;re very happy that you decided to sign up for our team.  
It&#39;s just that...well, how do I put this?&quot;

            &quot;We&#39;re not sure if you can handle the physical stress,&quot; 
Leena stated bluntly.  Freya&#39;s face lit up and she grinned, signaling to 
her companions.  With their assistance, she was able to get out of her 
wheelchair, though her legs were a little wobbly.

            &quot;I just got over an illness, so I&#39;m not as strong as I 
usually am.  But I assure you, I can walk perfectly well under normal 
circumstances.&quot;

            &quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; Leena said, but Freya interrupted 
her again.

            &quot;Oh, I know.  I&#39;m hardly the physical specimen you are, Frau 
Leena.  I didn&#39;t mean I&#39;d join the team.  What I want to become is its 
manager!!&quot;

--Freya von Hohenheim, 18, Computer animation major, team manager--

            &quot;...and thus concludes my five basic strategies for team 
victory under any circumstance.  This is just a generic model, of 
course, and since I don&#39;t know the exact stats of the other players, it 
is subject to some change.  These, however, are the basic principles 
behind my theorem.  Since I&#39;ll be running for Vice-President of the 
student body, I may not always be here to offer my advice, so this will 
fill in the blanks.  Now if you&#39;ll allow me to present Maria&#39;s ideas 
about team uniforms, we&#39;ll move right along.&quot;

            &quot;No thank you,&quot; Leena managed, feeling overwhelmed.  She 
didn&#39;t think Freya was serious when she proposed fifty ideas for the new 
soccer team, but the young lady proved her wrong, and announced every 
one until Leena couldn&#39;t take anymore.  She had lasted all the way up to 
#9.  &quot;All right, you&#39;ve convinced me.  You&#39;ll make a fine manager.  
I&#39;m...assuming your two friends will also be involved.&quot;

            &quot;Oh yes, quite,&quot; Freya replied.  &quot;They contributed several 
ideas, so it&#39;s only fair that they get to take part in this.  Would you 
like to hear them?&quot;

            &quot;Maybe another time!&quot; she blurted frightfully.  Freya was a 
little scary; she went into great detail about her thoughts, and had 
obviously obsessed over most of them for days on end.  If only a few of 
the other players were that serious!

            &quot;Well, all right,&quot; she murmured, stuffing her ideas back in 
their portfolio.  She felt a little weak, so she climbed back into her 
wheelchair and took a place next to Kathlyn (who was still a little wary 
of Maria).  Unfortunately, since Freya&#39;s &quot;presentation&quot; ate up a lot of 
time, Leena couldn&#39;t possibly devote much of her attention to the other 
ladies.  They all performed well enough, but none of them really stood 
out to her--none, that is, except for one woman who showed excellent 
martial arts skills.  Terra had brought her in and introduced her to 
Leena, who gave her a chance to prove herself.  The woman&#39;s name was Amy 
Nguyen, and as awkward as she was around people--the poor thing 
stuttered and grunted--she was in great shape, and Leena felt that such 
skills would be useful.  Amy blushed as Leena announced she had made the 
cut, and Terra gave her new friend a heartfelt congratulations.

            It wasn&#39;t entirely fair to say that only one person had 
drawn Leena&#39;s attention.  There was another girl there who impressed 
her, taking long, upfield passes that was not unlike an outlet pass in 
basketball.  She was certainly forceful and persistent, at least as much 
as Fausta--she even played the same position.  Leena could tell she was 
a solid, experienced player, and wanted to include her, but feared that 
a violent rivalry would spring up between the two girls.  She nearly 
considered cutting one of them, but then she noticed how defensive the 
woman was about the other applicants:  how she looked after them, cared 
for them, and called unfair plays whenever one of them was slighted.  
That sporting attitude made Leena reconsider, and she wondered if it 
would ever rub off on Fausta.  Only one way to find out.

A good ol&#39; gal from Boston, a tomboy raised by a trucker

A loyal soul who&#39;s not afraid to duke it out and defend her team

A daddy&#39;s girl and a sports fan, rough-and-tumble princess

Shannon Threal

            &quot;That wasn&#39;t half bad, huh Coach?!&quot; she exclaimed 
breathlessly, shining beautifully in the late afternoon light.  Leena 
shook her head warmly.

            &quot;You were actually quite impressive.  I admire your 
sportsmanship...uh, or is it sportswomanship?  However, I&#39;m going to be 
relying on you to guide some of the less experienced girls, and I may 
call on you to settle arguments if necessary.  Are you capable of doing 
that?&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ve nevah been one for diplomacy, Coach,&quot; Shannon replied 
honestly.  She held up her fists proudly.  &quot;Usually I just settle my 
fights with these babies.  But if it means gettin&#39; to be on the team, I 
could prob&#39;ly just hollah real loud.  Would that work?&quot;

            &quot;As long as you don&#39;t start any fights,&quot; Leena answered.  
Shannon grinned and rammed her fist into her palm.

            &quot;Awesome!  I&#39;ll do my best!  So when do I get to meet the 
othas?&quot;

            &quot;Soon enough.  We have eight so far; we&#39;ll need three more 
at least.  Well, at the rate we&#39;re going, we may yet find them all 
before Wednesday.&quot;

            &quot;Uh, what happens on Wednesday?&quot;  Leena smiled tightly and 
closed her notebook.

            &quot;Classes start.&quot;  Shannon turned pale.

            &quot;Oh.  Uh, maybe this ain&#39;t the best time for it, but I nevah 
was good at school work.  Not good, at least.&quot;

            &quot;That shouldn&#39;t be a problem,&quot; she murmured, eyeing Freya as 
she introduced herself and her crew to Amy and Terra.  Shannon grinned 
and slapped Leena on the shoulder.

            &quot;Well, if you say so, Coach.  Thanks for puttin&#39; me in!&quot;

            &quot;My pleasure.  Now if only that man would hurry up,&quot; she 
sighed to herself--&quot;or at least keep in touch.  You&#39;d think he would 
know how a cell phone works!&quot;

--Alice Hawthorne, 23, Neurochemistry major, no position--

            &quot;So now comes the hard part.  You&#39;ve gotta decide, Miss 
Beckett.  We only have a week left to recruit a full team.&quot;  Kasumi 
looked into her father&#39;s eyes, searching for his approval, or at least 
his opinion.  This had been her greatest dream for as long as she could 
remember, but now she hesitated, worried what her father would do if she 
left him.  He didn&#39;t answer her, because he didn&#39;t want her decision to 
hinge on what he wanted:  this was all about his daughter, and what she 
believed to be the right course of action.  Kasumi gradually began to 
understand her father&#39;s heart the deeper she peered into his eyes, until 
finally she released a warm, uncertain smile, and took a breath that 
sealed her fate.

            &quot;I&#39;m sorry about lashing out earlier.  You don&#39;t know how 
much your offer means to me.  It would be...a dream come true for me to 
go to college and play soccer.  Really...thank you.&quot;  Warren sighed with 
relief; the hard part was over.

            &quot;Don&#39;t thank me, Miss Beckett:  I just came here to talk you 
into it.  If you wanna show your gratitude, go see the Coach or the 
Dean.  They&#39;re the instigators, not me.  Welp, Randy, looks like you&#39;ll 
be short a daughter.  Think you can manage?&quot;

            &quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry about me,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;This old 
guy&#39;s got plenty of fight left in him.  Kasumi&#39;s the only one that 
matters now.  When are you planning on leaving?&quot;

            &quot;A-sap,&quot; he grunted as he stood up.  &quot;I&#39;ll go warm the car 
up and notify the Coach.  Girls, you help the newcomer pack up.&quot;

            &quot;What?!&quot; Felicity shrieked.  &quot;Why are you giving us the hard 
job?&quot;

            &quot;That&#39;s unfair of you,&quot; Fausta snorted.  &quot;If you were any 
gentleman, you&#39;d give us a hand.&quot;

            &quot;So&#39;re you saying you want me raiding through a young 
woman&#39;s possessions?  I&#39;m trying to spare the newbie some embarrassment.  
Besides, this&#39;ll give you time to get acquainted!  Ugh, young people 
just don&#39;t think anymore...&quot;

            &quot;Ass!!&quot; Fausta roared as Warren slipped outside.  She threw 
her shoe at the door, and retrieved it stuffily.  &quot;I hope you don&#39;t have 
anything heavy, bambina!  Let&#39;s get moving!&quot;  She stormed off to 
Kasumi&#39;s room, leaving her alone with her father and Felicity.  Velur 
blew out some steam and glanced up at the taller woman.

            &quot;Uh, I&#39;m pretty sure nobody else on the team is as bad as 
she is.  I&#39;m Felicity, by the way.  The ghibli you saw is Fausta.&quot;  They 
shook hands.

            &quot;Mmn, you already know my name.  Dad, do you think you 
could...&quot;

            &quot;Just show me what to lift!&quot; he exclaimed cheerfully, 
flexing his biceps.  Kasumi giggled softly and led the way, weathering 
the worst of Nazario&#39;s curses.

            While the girls were busy packing what few belongings Kasumi 
owned (including the old X-Box system her father had bought for when she 
moved out), Arthur was taking what he believed to be a well-deserved 
rest.  In all honesty, he could have helped them with moving, but...nah, 
that wasn&#39;t his thing.  He chuckled slyly and dug for his cell phone, 
but grumbled as he saw how depleted its reserves were.

            &quot;Ach, damned battery.  Of all the times!  And of course, 
fool that I am, I didn&#39;t bring anything to charge it with.  Shoot, I 
didn&#39;t even give Leena&#39;s number to the girls.  Ach, stupid idiot!  Well, 
nothing to be done about it now.  I guess she&#39;ll just have to be 
surprised.&quot;

            He eventually helped them haul a few boxes in his car, and 
even promised to come back to pick up the rest.  Kasumi was 
speechless--not only because of the way her life was changing, but also 
due to the sudden kindness of these strangers.  Growing up in that rough 
neighborhood taught her to be wary of others, but these people were 
showing her a generosity she had not seen in...oh, probably ever.  She 
was numbed by it, and said very little as she gave her father one final 
hug before squeezing into the passenger seat, next to Felicity.  She 
closed her eyes and didn&#39;t open them again until they were out of DC.

            The car was deathly quiet during the long drive back, except 
for the radio.  Fausta was reclining in her seat, breathing gently as 
she tried to nap, while Kasumi and Felicity sat patiently, their hands 
folded and their faces void of emotion.  Beckett was still trying to 
come to grips with her recent decision; she thought the process of 
moving out would take days, or even weeks, and she would ease into it 
slowly.  Felicity was just naturally silent, the type of person who 
minded her own business and never got involved with others if she could 
help it.  She did notice how Kasumi was looking at her back there in her 
house, but what did that really mean?

            I have to admit, she&#39;s beautiful!  I wish I could be that 
tough.  I wish...I had a father like hers.  We&#39;re so different.

            &quot;So are you both on the team?&quot; Kasumi asked out of the blue.  
Fausta grumbled an affirmative and went back to sleep; Felicity nodded.  
&quot;Hmm.  What&#39;s the coach like?&quot;

            &quot;I don&#39;t really know,&quot; Felicity whispered.

            &quot;A hell of a woman,&quot; Arthur repeated.  &quot;That&#39;s sufficient 
enough.&quot;

            &quot;Oh.  And where is this school?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, not too far.  You could visit your old man on the 
weekends.  Right now, we just need to get you registered and situated.  
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be any problems, though--and knowing 
Leena, she&#39;ll take you in a heartbeat!&quot;

            &quot;I see.&quot;  Arthur clucked his tongue, feeling discouraged.

            &quot;Jeez Louise, I never thought I&#39;d be the most talkative 
person in a car full of girls!  Well, you are perfect strangers, pretty 
much.  I guess you just need time.&quot;  Kasumi hummed softly and shifted in 
her seat; Felicity risked glancing over, and felt her heart get caught 
in her throat.

            I wish I had the courage to talk to her.  She&#39;s so 
beautiful!  But how would she react if she knew I was a...if she knew I 
was &quot;that way&quot;?  How would anybody react?  Ugh, just don&#39;t think about 
it.  Concentrate on the game.  Just the game.  Put your mind on 
practice.  Uh...oh, screw that--I can&#39;t help it!

            &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Kasumi murmured.  &quot;You look like you need to 
make a pit stop.&quot;

            &quot;No, I&#39;m fine.  Just trying to focus on the game.&quot;

            &quot;We&#39;re not playing the game yet,&quot; Beckett sighed, resting 
against her seat.  &quot;If you&#39;re the type who obsesses over something so 
trivial, we won&#39;t get along well.  If you can relax, we might pull 
through as friends.  The choice is yours, lady.&quot;


            God, she looks so hot just lying there...  And she seems 
pretty smart, and nice!  Oh...maybe I should just go to sleep and forget 
about all this!  I&#39;ve got enough on my mind as it is!

            And so, three angels spent the rest of the trip in dreams.

--Shannon Threal, 19, Sociology major, stopper position--

            &quot;There they are,&quot; Leena exclaimed in relief.  She looked at 
the women she had recruited for the day--a decidedly smaller number than 
before--and clapped her hands, drawing their attention.  &quot;Well, ladies, 
now we&#39;ll find out if we get another volunteer or not.  Of course, this 
wait would&#39;ve been much easier if Mr. Warren had remembered to call me, 
but I digress.&quot;

            Amy, Freya, Shannon, and Terra watched a middle-aged man and 
two girls around their age--a brunette and an Italian woman--emerge from 
the vehicle.  The man, presumably Mr. Warren, faced Leena and waved his 
arm in the air, flashing a thumbs-up.  Then a tall, dark-haired woman 
came out of the car, crossing her arms defensively, looking like all of 
this was too good to be true.  Warren pointed her in Leena&#39;s direction 
and dismissed the other two, who chose to stay behind and practice a 
little.

            &quot;Uh, hello,&quot; Kasumi mumbled, shoving her hands in her 
pockets.  &quot;I guess you&#39;re Coach Leena.  The old guy said you were a hell 
of a woman.&quot;

            &quot;Did he, now?&quot; she grinned.  &quot;Katt, remind me to thank Mr. 
Warren later.  Am I correct to assume that you&#39;re the star player he 
discovered in Washington, DC?&quot;

            &quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; she nodded, remembering her manners.  Kasumi 
may have grown up in a seedy part of town, but she wasn&#39;t crude.  &quot;I&#39;m 
Kasumi Joan Beckett, age twenty.&quot;

            &quot;All right.  What position did you play before, Miss 
Beckett?&quot;

            &quot;Usually the striker, ma&#39;am, but I don&#39;t mind being put 
anywhere else.  Um, if you need me to demonstrate, I can do that for 
you.&quot;  Leena smiled and turned down the offer.

            &quot;No, I&#39;ll take Mr. Warren&#39;s word for it.  You&#39;ll make a fine 
addition to the team, Kasumi.  Kathlyn here will help walk you through 
the academic process.&quot;

            &quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll never find anyone more accustomed to the 
aggravating nightmares than me!&quot; she joked sourly.  Kasumi smiled 
feebly, but was afraid that she was out of place.  It would only take 
one meeting of the rest of her teammates to change her mind.

Author&#39;s note:  &quot;Ghibli&quot; is an Italian word for hot wind from the Sahara 
Desert--quite a fitting description of Fausta!
