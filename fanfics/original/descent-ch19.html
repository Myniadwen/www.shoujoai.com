<a href="../original/descent-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Sister Samantha Teresa sat in the park, the brown
haired young woman breaking up pieces of bread and
tossing them on the sidewalk for the pigeons. Her
brown hair fell into tired eyes, her priest&#39;s clothes
a bit wrinkled from a week of very hectic activity.

&quot;Hello, Sam,&quot; Aileen said calmly, the casually dressed
redhead settling into a seat beside her. Her jacket
bulged slightly on one side, indicating she was
carrying at least one hidden weapon, and her eyes
warily scanned the busy park.

Sam watched with faint amusement as the birds fiercely
squabbled over the crumbs of bread. &quot;You have no idea
how surprised I was to hear from you,&quot; she finally
said, looking up at her with a kind of wary welcome.

&quot;No more than I was hearing you were allied with a
demon,&quot; Aileen shrugged. She smiled slightly, &quot;Would I
regret asking what&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Descent is a demon with a soul,&quot; Sam said to her
simply, &quot;she&#39;s working to stop the Lady Diana&#39;s
operations.&quot; A faintly nasty smile and she added, &quot;And
the Lady tried to manipulate me into doing her dirty
work.&quot;

&quot;Well, I know you didn&#39;t take that lying down,&quot; Aileen
didn&#39;t even make it a question, she knew Sam that
well.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sam&#39;s eyes hardened, &quot;and she corrupted and
destroyed a church in baiting me in. I&#39;m going to find
the employee that did it and gut her.&quot;

&quot;What happened to Christian charity?&quot; Aileen mocked.

&quot;That is me being charitable, you don&#39;t even want to
know what I&#39;d like to do to her,&quot; Sam answered
surprisingly coldly. She looked over at Aileen and
asked grimly, &quot;How the hell are you mixed up in this?&quot;

&quot;I was out on the west coast playing avenger,&quot; Aileen
said frankly, &quot;knocking off crime lords for money when
Grace contacted me. She told me about the demon and a
Templar, but neglected to tell me about it being you
until I got here.&quot;

&quot;Grace obviously doesn&#39;t know about our background
together,&quot; Sam noted.

&quot;Her people probably know all about my expulsion from
the Order,&quot; Aileen said without a quaver in her voice,
&quot;but they probably just think that I&#39;m willing to go
after the Templars without asking any questions.&quot;

&quot;I still think the Templar lost a great Knight when
you were expelled,&quot; Sam said with a scowl, leaning
back casually.

&quot;I was caught in the act by the Bishop with that cute
nun,&quot; Aileen answered honestly. She smiled grimly,
&quot;But thank you for speaking up for me.&quot;

&quot;There was no reason you had to give up your calling,
we Knights always operated differently than other
orders. About half of the Knights messed around,&quot; Sam
shrugged uncomfortably, &quot;you were just the unlucky one
who was caught.&quot;

&quot;Anyway, that&#39;s the past,&quot; Aileen waved it off. &quot;The
Lady has pulled out all the stops to stop you and
organized a band of the best killers in the country,&quot;
she said, quickly sketching in descriptions of the
murderers.

Sam raised an eyebrow, &quot;And will you be going out with
them?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Aileen answered promptly, &quot;what did you
expect?&quot;

Sam just smiled. &quot;So which of the hitmen are you
trying to collect a bounty on?&quot; Sam asked her, tossing
more crumbs for the pigeons.

&quot;As many of them as I can,&quot; Aileen said with a cocky
little grin, &quot;but I&#39;m concentrating on Thrill Kill. &quot;
Her expression went serious, &quot;She&#39;s a multiple
murderess, but worse she also doesn&#39;t care about
bystanders.&quot;

&quot;Then I wish you good hunting,&quot; Sam said with a bold
nod. Her voice became oddly tender as she added, &quot;Be
careful, you&#39;re playing a dangerous game with the
Lady. I&#39;d hate to hear that something happened to
you.&quot;

&quot;You, too,&quot; Aileen nodded, getting up from her seat.
Without a backward glance she strode away, soon
disappearing into the crowds.

With a sigh Sam shredded the last of the bread and
tossed it out, then she got up herself. Keeping a wary
eye out she navigated through the crowds, eventually
making her way out of the park and over to where a
taxi was waiting for a fare.

&quot;Where to, mac?&quot; the redhead smiled, looking over her
shoulder at Sam.

&quot;The Daughters, thanks Amaterasu,&quot; Sam said with a
sigh, glad that Athena had called this cabbie for her.
Otherwise she would have to walk, being unsure if a
possible driver was one of the Lady&#39;s assassins in
disguise.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Amaterasu answered as she pulled the cab
out into traffic. &quot;You been in the city long?&quot; she
asked conversationally.

&quot;A few weeks,&quot; Sam admitted, smiling faintly. &#39;First I
had that business with Jess Drake, now all this,&#39; she
thought, &#39;time&#39;s flown by.&#39;

&quot;Other than the Daughters you have a chance to see the
sights?&quot; Amaterasu looked curious as she weaved them
through cars easily.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Sam conceded, &quot;I&#39;m here on business,
more or less.&quot; With a wry smile she thought to
herself, &#39;Most of what I&#39;ve seen of the city has been
bars, drug houses and other dens of vice and
corruption.&#39;

&quot;You should try living a little,&quot; Amaterasu looked
amused, &quot;all work and no play make Jack a dull boy and
all that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Sam offered with a laugh.

Amaterasu grinned, &quot;I&#39;m so sure.&quot; She slipped them
through a gap between two cars, &quot;So, you in on the
Jess Drake betting pool?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Sam blinked.

&quot;There&#39;s a betting pool at the bar involving Jess&#39;
breakup with Alice,&quot; Amaterasu explained cheerfully,
&quot;you can put money on their getting back together,
splitting, or even how long it&#39;ll take for them to
hook up again.&quot;

Sam frowned, &quot;Isn&#39;t it just a bit cruel, betting on
those women like that?&quot;

&quot;Probably,&quot; Amaterasu shrugged it off casually.

Sam shook her head, smiling faintly as they came to a
stop at her temporary home, the Daughters of Artemis.
She paid off her fare then said, &quot;Thanks for the
ride.&quot;

&quot;Just call me if you need another one,&quot; Amaterasu
grinned, &quot;or anything else for that matter. With that
she waved before taking off recklessly once again.

Sam strode up the walkway, puffing out a relieved sigh
only when she crossed over into the bar itself. There
was a faint tingle as she crossed the outer and inner
defenses, and a feeling of peace within. The magical
defenses on the bar weren&#39;t unbeatable but it would
likely take an act of god to break through them.

&quot;Hey,&quot; Alex Conner nodded her greeting from where she
was sitting with several off duty officers. The
redhead excused herself and walked over, &quot;Descent told
me to let you know she&#39;s on a beer run with Circe,
they&#39;ll be back soon.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully there won&#39;t be any trouble,&quot; Sam frowned.

&quot;I don&#39;t think the Lady would risk it,&quot; Alex answered
promptly, &quot;she needs the Daughters around, if only as
neutral territory to talk about business with
enemies.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe that Diana and Circe let the
Lady do business here,&quot; Sam scowled as they started
towards the bar.

&quot;It&#39;s the price they have to pay for the sort of
sanctuary that they&#39;re giving you,&quot; Alex reminded her
gently.

Sam winced slightly at that comment. &quot;Okay, true
enough,&quot; she admitted. She studied Alex a moment,
&quot;Could I talk to you a moment? I&#39;ve got some new
information...&quot;

&quot;Glad to help,&quot; Alex nodded, the two walking up to the
bar where, oddly, Athena was slinging the drinks. &quot;Two
beers,&quot; she ordered, putting the money down.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Athena pulled two beers and set the cups
down, not spilling any of the foam on the counter top.
&quot;Mind if I listen in?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Please do,&quot; Sam said as she began to fill them in on
her day.</pre>
