Riverdale Maximum Security Prison, Manchester, Neo-England 

&quot;Lunch is in two minutes, you lazy slobs!&quot;

Esperanza D&#39;Laine flicked her fingers through a hair pin she had in her 
hands. As the prison guard walked by her cell and banged on the bars, 
she noted that it would be time to eat soon. Not that it was 
particularly exciting food anyways. If there were any similarities 
between the Pre-Comet world and the Post-Comet world, it was that the 
conditions of their prisons were all the same. And Esperanza couldn&#39;t 
believe that she had gotten stuck in this place. It had been two months 
since the death of Al Gul Jehed. And the Covenant had fallen into such 
disarray because of this that their forces were bombarded with 
confusion. Diana had taken control of the Covenant of Sorcerers; being 
that she was Al Gul&#39;s second in command. And her first action was to 
surrender to the allied forces of the Order of Light and the Neo World 
Federation. 

Esperanza was one of the lucky ones. The only real crime she had 
committed was taking the Shadow Edge without permission. And since she 
confessed to this crime, the Grand Court of the World Federation were 
lenient. Six months in a maximum security prison. It could have been 
worse, although some people got off lighter than others. Essentially, 
Diana Angelinous  had committed far worse than Esperanza had done, but 
because of her &#39;help&#39; in the defeat of Al Gul Jehed, she was cleared of 
her crimes. Some were obviously luckier than others... 

&quot;Maybe Saizaki will come visit me...&quot; The American staff master sighed, 
her head flopping onto the pillow of her mattress. At that point, she 
looked over to her left and saw her female cellmate propped up against a 
wall, with a lusty smile on her chiselled face.

&quot;Hey,&quot; She said suggestively, &quot;You&#39;re new, right? Want me to show you 
around?&quot; 

Esperanza rolled her eyes, irritably. &quot;...Don&#39;t even think about it.&quot;

Prasutagus Manor, Greenwashe, Cath Maige Tuired

&quot;Oh God! It&#39;s a letter from Rhiannon!&quot;

Normally Bonnie took great care in how she handled the flower gardens. 
Ever since her personal guardian Prasutagus had allowed Bonnie to live 
with him, she had been taking better care of his gardens for him. The 
Manor itself was all that mattered to Prasutagus, and so Bonnie felt 
that it was her duty to be take care of the gardens of it for him. She 
was happy to do it. And ever since word had spread about the end of the 
War of Magics, she had good reason to be happy. But there was one thing 
that bothered Bonnie. 

Rhiannon.

For a good few months after she left, Bonnie had heard nothing from the 
girl. All she knew was that Rhiannon left to go find the Quetzacoatl. 
That was over a month ago. And Bonnie had heard nothing from her. Until 
now. The butler of the Manor passed by Bonnie in the vastness of the 
gardens and handed her a letter that was addressed to her. Though Bonnie 
wasn&#39;t the quickest runner in the race, she&#39;d know that handwriting from 
anywhere.

Bonnie quickly opened the letter and began reading aloud,

&quot;Dearest Bonnie, 

I am so sorry that I haven&#39;t gotten in touch with you sooner. Ever since 
the war started, post has been a thing of luxury. I assume that this&#39;ll 
get to you eventually, now that the War of Magics is finally over. By 
the time I wrote this, I was in Neo-Brazil, following a lead I got about 
the Quetzacoatl. Since I was given leave from active duty I didn&#39;t have 
to wait to long to get on a ship and sail here. And believe it or not, I 
actually met with Leignitz down here. He was just as nasty, rude, 
arrogant and anti-social as ever, but his search for the Quetzacoatl led 
him to the exact same place as me. I think that may be a good sign. So 
he grudgingly agreed to work with me until we regain the staff. I&#39;m sure 
we&#39;ll get it back soon. And when I do, I&#39;ll come right back to you. 
Until then, please take care of yourself, Bonnie. 

I love you so much.

Rhiannon.&quot;

Bonnie lowered the letter from her gaze and sighed deeply, shutting her 
eyes. Rhiannon was okay. Who knew? Maybe she&#39;d be back soon. All she had 
to do was hope for that day to come as soon as possible. And then they 
would be together again.

Village of the Snow Dragon, St. Petersburg, Neo Russia 

Well, this brought back memories. Aarin looked around this place. The 
Village of the Snow Dragon. Such a peaceful and tranquil place. It was a 
tiny town on the edge of St. Petersburg, unnoticeable but a very nice 
place to stay. He and Gwendolyn often came to this place in their youth 
to enjoy the happiness and cheer of the locale. Very rarely did you find 
a Post-Comet people so cheerful. But they had every reason to be happy 
right now. The war was over. And so, Aarin had done the right thing and 
stepped down from his position as leader. He had done all he wanted now. 
The war had ended, Al Gul Jehed was no longer a threat to the earth and 
the Covenant was in the control of Diana; who Aarin was sure could live 
peacefully now. 

The aging master walked through the cobblestone paths of the Village of 
the Snow Dragon, towards the small little home he was in search of. The 
Double Cleaver was not at his back. His faithful weapon had been left 
behind, as was his Order of Light uniform. He was dressed in the simple 
clothing of a Neo-Russian farmer. Nothing more, nothing less. Aarin 
strode through the town till he reached the appointed place. No. 2 off 
Polchek street. The master walked up to the door and knocked.

Seconds later, the wooden door swung open leisurely. But the woman who 
opened the door... her reaction to Aarin was less than leisure-full. The 
woman, in her mid-40&#39;s, was shocked, her eyes glassing over with fragile 
tears, whilst the old man gave her a warm smile. 

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you again, Rowena.&quot; Aarin said cheerfully. 

Rowena burst into tears and wrapped her arms around her father. &quot;Daddy! 
Oh dear God, it&#39;s really you! You&#39;re alive! I thought I&#39;d never see you 
again!&quot;

Aarin cradled the sobbing Rowena in his arms, and took a look over her 
shoulder. Inside the house were all three of his grandchildren, Kathryn, 
Nastasia and Aarin jnr. Each of them were just as happy to see their 
grandfather in the flesh. It was a joyful day. And Aarin could not help 
but shed a few tears himself. After all the fighting and mayhem, he was 
finally with his family again. 

Protecting them was total justification for all his sacrifices.

Withersmoon Gravesite, Bristol, Neo-England 

It was only a few months ago that Diana had come to this place. The 
stone door to the crypt was still in the position she left it in. But 
this was what she wanted. To come and pay her respects. Diana walked 
into the tomb that housed Zephaniah&#39;s stone coffin. And there it was. In 
Diana&#39;s hands, were a bouquet of flowers. White roses. A known favourite 
of Zephaniah&#39;s in his youth. 

Diana walked to the stone coffin, and rested the flowers on top of it. 
She then kneeled down and spoke to him, her sadness slowly easing away 
as a smile crossed her lips. 

&quot;My love,&quot; She began, &quot;I have not forgotten you. How could I ever have 
forgotten you? After all you are the first and only person I have ever 
been in love with. And I will never forget our times together. Because I 
doubt I will ever love anyone the way I love you. But... this romance of 
the past... it must remain where it is. In the past. Your unwillingness 
to relinquish the past caused you to bring me back to life. And my 
unwillingness relinquish the past caused me to fall prey to darkness... 
and because of this I have killed many innocents. It is time for us to 
both let go of the past... together. I am trying to make amends for my 
crimes by leading the Covenant of Sorcerers into a peaceful future. And 
if I succeed in revoking the Anti-Magic Law, I believe I will end the 
prejudices that humanity has taken against the magic-users. As long as I 
have your strength inside of me... I will bring peace to this ruined 
world. And maybe then I will truly beget the world we dreamed of.&quot;

Diana then stood upright, blowing a kiss to Zephaniah&#39;s coffin. 
&quot;Goodbye, my love.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

The Palace of Freiheit, Munich, Neo-Germany 

&quot;...And so, for your exemplary services to the Order of Light, you are 
officially promoted to the position of Major. And we proudly grant you 
with the weapon you used to smite evil, the sacred Lightning Tooth. My 
congratulations go to you, Major Rainhande Schaidler.&quot;

The bowed Rainhande received a great ovation from the entire 
congregation. To think that nearly the entire Order of Light had 
gathered together at the Palace of Freiheit for this occasion. The 
anointing of three brave soldiers with the blades they bravely used in 
the fight against Al Gul Jehed. The only person who wasn&#39;t here was 
Aarin, who had renounced his position as leader and had gone to visit 
his family in Neo-Russia. Rainhande, fully dressed in his formal Order 
of Light tunic, nodded to the anointer in thanks, taking the Lightning 
Tooth and its sheath from him. 

The anointer then turned to Lilia, picking up the Wind Soul and sheath 
from a nearby table of gold. &quot;For your exemplary services to the Order 
of Light, you are officially promoted to the position of Captain. And we 
proudly grant you with the weapon you used to smite evil, the sacred 
Wind Soul. My congratulations go to you, Captain Lilia Lemieux Morin.&quot;

Lilia nodded to him and took the sword in her bowed position, blushing a 
little from the claps she received from the crowds applauding her in 
this large hall of the Palace. Her arm was still broken, and therefore 
in a sling, but it did nothing to harm the pride she felt in all this. 
Or the adoration people felt for her. The anointer turned back to the 
table and took up the Fire Cutter, still wrapped in its sheath. He then 
turned to Saizaki and said;

&quot;For your exemplary services to the Order of Light, you are officially 
promoted to the position of Captain. And we proudly grant you with the 
weapon you used to smite evil, the sacred Fire Cutter. My 
congratulations go to you, Captain Saizaki Seisuji.&quot;

The anointments were over. All three rose up and were engulfed with the 
cheers, praise and applause of the surrounding crowds. It was a 
brilliant moment for them, and even Saizaki could not hide the pride he 
felt at being thanked for his efforts. And the fact that the Order of 
Light trusted him with the Fire Cutter, well, that spoke for itself. 
Saizaki had to admit that not all of the members of the Order were 
corrupt. 

Lilia leaned over and whispered to Saizaki as her healthy hand waved to 
the crowds. &quot;So then, Captain Seisuji. Still planning on leaving the 
Order of Light after all this?&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; The Japanese youth responded, &quot;I&#39;ve still gotta keep an eye on 
you, Captain Morin.&quot;

???

Deep in the seamy undersides of a sandy desert, there was an object. 
Sand passed over this object, and those would believe it was nothing 
would soon learn that it meant more. It was not just a piece of old 
metal junk. There was a secret buried inside it that had began nearly 
seven decades ago... a secret on more than just one level. The metal 
ball rose up from the sand in which it had been buried. A door was in 
the middle of it. This door opened, a puff of gassy old air leaking from 
this release. And out from that large metal ball came a man. A tall 
young man, looking no more than 22 years of age. He stood dressed in 
nothing but tattered clothing brown clothing, but it could not hide 
significance of him. His broad muscles gleamed in the sunlight. His 
piecing blue eyes looked up to the baking hot sun, and his long raven 
black hair trailed down to his back. There was a quiet dignity in this 
man. But there were secrets within in him that were going to change 
things. For better or for worse? Who knew? But there was something this 
young man knew. He knew it without hesitation. 

&quot;...Al Gul Jehed,&quot; He said this slowly and throatily, his voice 
obviously had not been used in a while. &quot;...He has been killed. Humph. 
Those who wield great power but lack righteousness are destined to die. 
Such is the will of God...&quot;

And so, a new chapter begins...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

AMEN 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

All this time has whittled away
Like so many days in one

Back and forth the leaders sway
Backing it up with guns

Superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings

Egos will feed
While citizens bleed
That&#39;s always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time

When will the truth come in to season
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time

All they want is what they can defend
Before their time is up
Make the same mistakes again
Heard it all before

Superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings

Egos will feed
While citizens bleed

That&#39;s always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time

When will the truth come in to season
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time

Well if they tried maybe they&#39;d see
It&#39;d do a little good to let the world be free
Handshake and a smile 
Gets you on through
Then turn it all around 
With a suicide move

But you know it&#39;s not fooling anyone but me
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see

But you know it&#39;s not fooling anyone but me
You gotta make yourself see what you want to see

Superpowers flex their wings
Hold the world on puppet strings

Egos will feed
While citizens bleed

That&#39;s always the way it goes

When will the world listen to reason
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time

When will the truth come in to season
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time
I&#39;ve a feeling it&#39;ll be a long time
