<h1>Project Angelus (part 4 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>      Eveon wasn&#39;t sure how she managed to convince Abby and Sakura to let her walk down to 
the convenience store to get milk, but it had something to do with it being daylight and 
there were lots of people on the sidewalks. At some point, she felt like she was being 
watched and knew the whole premise was a bad idea.

      Why didn&#39;t she stay indoors? Well, they ran out of milk and Eveon Kasaguri really 
loves her milk, if nothing else. It was then that she noticed the street was completely 
empty and there was no one on the sidewalk. The eerie feeling increased and Eveon quickly 
tried to escape into a nearby store.

      Unfortunately, Eveon didn&#39;t move fast enough as she was pulled away into a dark 
alley, by... well...

      &quot;We never got a chance to properly meet.&quot; Eveon paled - it was indeed the fiend from 
before. He smiled at her obviously distraught face. &quot;I&#39;m Solomon and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve 
noticed that no one is around to help you.&quot;

      Eveon tried to pull away, but he was holding her wrist too tightly. &quot;Let me go - even 
if I can see you, since you&#39;re touching me, I&#39;m sure others can as well.&quot;

      Solomon laughed a little bit. &quot;But there&#39;s no one around... what&#39;s your name?&quot;

      She needed to stall... &quot;It&#39;s Eveon.&quot; She tried to pull again, but it did nothing.

      His smile turned more devious and Eveon really did feel like a fool for going out 
that day. Just as she was about to kick him to try and get away, something jumped down from 
the roof and attacked. Before Eveon knew it, she&#39;d been swept up and carried somewhere.

      She shut her eyes in fright and only opened them when she&#39;d stopped moving. Eveon 
found herself sitting on the grass in the nearby park and the person who saved her... 
well... The girl cleaned off her bloody sword in the grass before sheathing it.

      It was the same girl who was asking Sakura for help... Eveon was surprised, but she 
supposed that sword wasn&#39;t there for nothing.

      &quot;Are you alright?&quot; The girl asked before noticing something. &quot;Oh - you&#39;re the girl 
from last night!&quot;

      Eveon nodded. &quot;Yeah, thanks a lot. I thought I was done for... I&#39;m Eveon Kasaguri by 
the way.&quot; She stood up to face the other girl, who was just a tad bit taller.

      &quot;I&#39;m Miki Uramoto,&quot; she said simply. Eveon gave her a scrutinizing look.

      &quot;You don&#39;t look Asian,&quot; Eveon finally said.

      Miki was a bit shocked before saying, &quot;This coming from a blonde girl?&quot;

      Eveon laughed. &quot;Well, my dad was, but only partly so that&#39;s why he had the funny last 
name. My mommy says it&#39;s a mystery why I got her blonde hair.&quot;

      Miki let out a sigh. &quot;I guess I should get you home... that man was probably why the 
Living Inferno was so antsy about helping me.&quot;

      Eveon nodded as they started walking out of the park. &quot;You mean Sakura? Yeah, that 
guy, fiend or whatever showed up at our house two nights ago and since I could see him-&quot;

      Miki abruptly stopped before turning around. &quot;You can see... fiends?&quot;

      It was then that Eveon felt like an idiot. Why did she have to say that? She could 
already see Miki working out a plan. &quot;If you can see them... then! Yes! Alright, you have 
to help me!&quot;

      Eveon shook her head. &quot;No way! If my powerful angel step-mom didn&#39;t want to do it, 
then why would I want to?!&quot;

      &quot;Step-mom? So your dad married her?&quot; Miki asked. Eveon just gave her a small smile, 
but the girl quickly got back on subject. &quot;But you have to help...! I... a woman is being 
tortured in there and the longer I wait, the more she gets hurt.&quot;

      Eveon gave her a dubious look. &quot;But I can&#39;t fight or do anything-&quot;

      Miki cut her off. &quot;I promise to protect you with my life. And I will do all the 
breaking in. You just have to do the looking.&quot;

      &quot;I want to go home,&quot; Eveon said finally. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but this isn&#39;t a good idea. 
Maybe if you return me safely, Sakura will be willing to help you out now.&quot;

      Miki let out a long guilty sigh before suddenly grabbing Eveon by the wrist. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry about this, Eveon...&quot;

      The girl tensed up. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be- you just saved me from getting kidnapped just 
so you could do the same thing?!&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s not really kidnapping if I saved you!&quot; Miki protested. &quot;Plus, if I let you go 
by yourself, that fiend is going to come back for you.&quot;

      Eveon gritted her teeth. &quot;It&#39;s still kidnapping... like, like secondary kidnapping or 
something!&quot; 

***** 

      And yet, Miki had still dragged her out into the middle of nowhere to save a random 
girl. Awesome. Eveon was sitting on the ground obviously not happy as Miki checked her 
maps. She&#39;d been breaking in to the different sectors of the Shadow Organization to get... 
well, certain information and to find out where they were keeping the prisoner.

      It was as simple as that, but... the organization was using a type of invisible filed 
derived from the power of fiends. Thus, she couldn&#39;t get into the building without the 
sight. Eveon was glaring at Miki, who had taken the battery out of the girl&#39;s cell phone. 
Maybe Erin&#39;s bracelet would do something, but...

      &quot;Look, we&#39;ll be done really fast,&quot; Miki said, getting anxious. &quot;You can see a 
building over there, can&#39;t you?&quot;

      Eveon stood up and looked past the tree to see a white facility just down the hill. 
There were no guards, which she thought was odd for an evil stronghold. &quot;Yeah...&quot;

      &quot;Alright, lead the way...&quot; Eveon let out a sigh but did as she was told, leading Miki 
close enough to the building that they passed the field.

      The girl drew her sword, now able to see the building. She handed a map to Eveon. &quot;If 
worse comes to worse and we get separated, use this map to escape. If you get caught, 
dispose of this somehow and claim you have no idea what&#39;s going on.&quot;

      Eveon nodded dumbly. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I already planned for it.&quot; She watched as Miki 
opened a back window carefully and slipped inside.

      She followed dutifully behind as Miki started to traverse the brightly lit hallways. 
&quot;Uh, not to question your ninja skills of breaking in or stealth, but shouldn&#39;t we not be 
walking out into the open?&quot; Eveon asked.

      Miki shook her head. &quot;This facility doesn&#39;t have many guards, though I&#39;m sure they 
stepped up the security because of me. It&#39;s a lot easier just to break in, beat everyone 
up, kill people who&#39;ve seen my face and move on.&quot;

      Eveon paled. &quot;Kill...?&quot;

      Miki looked back at her with a sheepish grin. &quot;If it helps you sleep at night, they 
aren&#39;t good guys at all. Plus, they shoot at me first anyway.&quot;

      &quot;They have guns? Awesome. Just peachy, Miki,&quot; Eveon moaned out. &quot;My girlfriend is 
going to find out that I&#39;ve been shot to pieces and she is going throw a fit.&quot;

      &quot;Girlfriend...?&quot; Miki asked quietly. &quot;Like your best friend?&quot;

      Eveon let out a sigh. &quot;As in &#39;I-make-out-with-my-girlfriend&#39; girlfriend.&quot;

      Miki whirled around in shock. &quot;You&#39;re GAY?!&quot;

      Eveon was about to tell her not to be so loud when an alarm on the wall went off and 
the lights turned red. Miki was still looking at her expectantly. &quot;Yes, I&#39;m gay you 
numbskull and you just set off the alarm system with your homophobic outburst!&quot;

      Miki stuttered a bit, &quot;I&#39;m not a h-homophobe! I&#39;m just genuinely surpr-&quot; She was cut 
off by the sound of footsteps and turned back to Eveon. &quot;I believe you need to make a great 
escape, Eveon.&quot;

      The blonde girl nodded. &quot;Oh, you bet. Can I have my cell phone battery back?&quot; Miki 
reached into her pocket and tossed it to her as Eveon started running the other way. The 
black haired girl let out a sigh as she turned to face the soldiers, all wearing their 
signature helmets with black visors.

      &quot;This is a private facility! Identify yourself!&quot;

      Miki just readied her sword as the soldiers cocked their guns. 

***** 

      Eveon looked at the map, before realizing it was essentially useless. The writing was 
neat and all, but she didn&#39;t know where she was. With a long sigh, she decided to try and 
find a room with a window and just get outside that way. As she walked down the hallway, 
she placed her battery back into her phone, though she was disappointed at the lack of 
service.

      Then again, evil strongholds weren&#39;t known for their great wireless signal. With a 
sigh, she pushed open a door that had been deactivated thanks to the alarm system. As she 
stepped inside, Eveon immediately noticed how dark it was and that there wasn&#39;t an escape 
window around for her to... well, escape.

      She turned to leave when she bumped into something in the darkness. Through the light 
spilling from the open door, Eveon noticed it was a tray... with rusty knives.

      Scratch that - bloody knives. Eveon Kasaguri was officially going to get the hell out 
of there. She froze on the spot when she heard a low moan from the middle of the room and 
the rustle of chains. She&#39;d watched enough scary movies to know that there was something 
there that she didn&#39;t wish to see.

      &quot;...please...!&quot;

      It was a soft voice, almost reminding Eveon of Sakura. The blonde girl stopped and 
tried to peer through the darkness. There was someone there, for sure... she blindly 
reached around, trying to find a light switch. When she finally flipped it, Eveon turned 
away immediately.

      It was bright spotlight, focused on the girl trapped in the room. It wasn&#39;t the 
bright light that made Eveon turn away in disgust. The girl was suspended in the air, 
chains wrapped in barbed wire holding her. The blonde&#39;s eyes swiveled to the knives she 
knocked onto the floor. There was a reason for all the cuts on her and the tools were right 
there...

      She gulped and turned back. The girl moaned again. &quot;...please! ...don&#39;t...&quot;

      Eveon took a deep breath and steeled herself. There had to be something around 
here... She quickly found a table and started blindly looking around. She found a some bolt 
clippers and figured they had to do. When she approached the girl, she reacted violently, 
spurting blood from new cuts made in her movement.

      That was when Eveon saw it - the bloody, torn up wings on her back. An angel...

      &quot;D... don&#39;t move,&quot; Eveon choked out. &quot;I&#39;m going to help you.&quot;

      She wished Sakura had listened to Miki - it was a horrible sight. Eveon quickly 
started at the angel&#39;s feet, putting as much pressure as she could to cut the chains. 
Finally, she freed her, but as Eveon caught the angel, she let out a sharp yell. The blonde 
took a look at her arm, now cut from some of the barbed wire.

      The alarms outside were still going off, so Eveon could only hope Miki was keeping 
the guards busy. Who would torture someone like this? She unwrapped the chains from the 
angel, no longer caring about the metal biting into her hands. It didn&#39;t matter - she 
needed to get this girl out of here.

      When she finished, the angel looked up at her with endlessly deep blue eyes that 
offset her dark brown hair. Eveon froze, but realized it wasn&#39;t the time for staring. &quot;I&#39;m 
guessing you can&#39;t walk, so...&quot; Eveon started to move her and the angel let out a slight 
scream.

      She couldn&#39;t stop now... Eveon got the angel on her back, regardless of her groans of 
pain. As soon as Eveon stood up, the angel wrapped her arms around her, as though she would 
disappear if she let go.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; Eveon said, walking out into the hallway with some trouble. The angel 
was crying and Eveon could feel blood soaking into her back.

      She had only gotten a few yards when she heard the telltale sounds of footsteps. The 
blonde started to try and jog away to a window she could see in another room. As she got 
into the doorway, the angel on her back slipped and Eveon had to crouch down in the room. 
She could hear the footsteps stop right behind her.

      The window was right there... Eveon slowly set down the angel and turned around, 
still crouching on the ground. &quot;Identify yourself!&quot; A guard shouted. &quot;Why are you taking 
the prisoner? She is the private property of this facility.&quot;

      Eveon bit her lip, not wanting to speak out and get shot. The angel tugged on her 
hand. &quot;...you... you&#39;re human...?&quot; The angel asked.

      Eveon nodded, but her attention was soon brought back to the guard. &quot;What is your 
name?!&quot;

      &quot;E... Eveon Kasaguri,&quot; she stammered out, still holding the angel&#39;s hand.

      &quot;...you mustn&#39;t... you mustn&#39;t let anyone know I gave it to you,&quot; the angel whispered 
before placing a chaste kiss on Eveon&#39;s right hand.

      Just as she was about to ask what the hell the angel was doing, the room was engulfed 
in a bright white. The brunette crawled in front of Eveon, shakily getting to her feet. &quot;I 
will... stop them... run... run before I have nothing left...&quot;

      Holy power engulfed the guards and they evaporated in the light. Eveon was frozen and 
startled. &quot;W-wait... just come with me!&quot; the blonde protested.

      &quot;...I have to... stall them... take it and run...!&quot;

      Eveon wasn&#39;t sure what she had to take, but she could only escape through the window 
and run.
