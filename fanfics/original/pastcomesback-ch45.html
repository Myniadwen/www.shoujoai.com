<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch44.html">Back to Part 44</a><pre>      When Eveon came out to the dining room to eat, she found it surprisingly empty. Hina 
had come in to get some food and drinks... so she assumed...? The blonde frowned, hearing 
the TV on in the living room.

      &quot;Mommy&#39;s gonna throw a fit if they&#39;re all eating on the couch,&quot; Eveon murmured, 
setting down her plate.

      &quot;Ah, is it time for breakfast?&quot; Eveon stopped mid way into eating her eggs when she 
recognized the voice. She turned to see Carmilla smiling down at her and cursed her 
infinitely bad luck. &quot;Would you care to get me something?&quot;

      &quot;We... we have raw steak in the freezer...?&quot; Eveon tried weakly, setting down her fork 
and preparing to sprint from her seat.

      Carmilla just laughed and before Eveon could even get out of her seat, the vampire had 
her. The blonde screamed at the horrifically familiar sensation of teeth sinking into her 
neck. It only lasted a second as Carmilla let out an &#39;eep!&#39; and tumbled to the floor.

      Eveon looked up to see a not so happy Sakura standing nearby, her hand still glowing 
with holy energy. Carmilla looked up at the angel with a weak grin before shakily getting to 
her feet. &quot;I... I was just whispering a secret into Eveon&#39;s ear,&quot; the vampire said quickly, 
wiping the blood off of her mouth. &quot;I... really, really didn&#39;t bite Eveon...?&quot;

      Sakura started walking towards her and Carmilla darted to the living room. &quot;Save me 
Tsuru!&quot;

      Abby came downstairs, yawning. Eveon sat back down with a sigh, wiping some of the 
blood off her neck with a napkin. &quot;Ah, jeez,&quot; Abby murmured, tilting her daughter&#39;s head to 
see the bite. &quot;Every time I leave you alone, either Carmilla bites you or Mina tries to 
molest you.&quot;

      Eveon just frowned. &quot;Thanks, mommy.&quot;

      &quot;Oh sorry. I guess it isn&#39;t really true... Mina doesn&#39;t try, does she?&quot;

      &quot;Mommy!&quot; Abby laughed and took a look at the food on Eveon&#39;s plate.

      &quot;Looks like you&#39;re getting really good. If I had known you were cooking for everyone, 
I would have woken up sooner,&quot; the mother said, sitting down next to her daughter.

      &quot;It&#39;s fine. I have to at least cook for you sometimes, right?&quot;

      Abby laughed again before looking more closely at the bite. &quot;You know... there&#39;s a 
perfect way to keep Carmilla from biting you.&quot;

      Eveon perked up at that. &quot;Really?&quot;

      &quot;Just let Mina put a collar on you and that&#39;ll protect your neck.&quot;

      Abby immediately got out of the chair in time to avoid the slap that Eveon tried to 
deliver. &quot;Mommy!&quot;

      &quot;Oh come on - I bet she already has a nice one picked out, with her bondage fetish and 
all that. Melanie says Mina&#39;s been shopping online at some pretty risqu&Atilde;&copy; stores...&quot; Abby 
said, before ducking into the living room to avoid a platter of pancakes.

      She laughed a bit to herself before looking to see what everyone was doing. Abby was 
highly amused to see Sakura trying to zap Carmilla for biting Eveon. However, the vampire 
was using Tsuru as a human shield, much to the Demon Lord&#39;s distaste and embarrassment. 
Probably because Carmilla was unnecessarily brushing up against her shield in an 
inappropriate manner.

      Abby would have gone over and calmed Sakura down, but it was then she noticed Krystal, 
Isaka, Seth, Bakra, Josh and Tycara eating breakfast on the couch, watching a tennis match. 
She didn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t mind Tycara, but everyone else-

      &quot;Are you seriously eating breakfast on the couch?&quot; The five people in trouble jolted 
in surprise before turning around.

      &quot;It... it&#39;s not okay?&quot; Tycara asked, her own finished plate of strawberry pancakes 
resting on the coffee table. &quot;You let me and Eveon eat here all the time.&quot;

      &quot;That&#39;s because you&#39;re careful and don&#39;t spill things.&quot; At Abby response, Isaka 
started to try and hide the crumbs of toast she left on the couch. &quot;I suggest you all move 
to the dining room. In the next five seconds.&quot;

      Bakra let out a slight laugh. &quot;Uh... sorry about that... you aren&#39;t really going to do 
anything to us, are you?&quot;

      Abby just gave him a smile before grabbing Tycara&#39;s hand. The girl was only around 16 
or 17, so... &quot;Heed my call! Blades of-&quot;

      &quot;Holy cripes, are you serious?&quot;

      &quot;Abby, you&#39;ll destroy your own house?!&quot;

      &quot;We didn&#39;t even spill... that much!&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry we&#39;re leaving!&quot;

      &quot;I was done eating anyway!&quot;

      Abby watched as the five scoundrels picked up their messes and retreated. Tycara only 
pouted. &quot;And people tell me not to abuse my powers...&quot;

      Abby just gave her a kiss on the forehead. &quot;I&#39;m your mommy - do as I say, not as I 
do... oh Sakura! Don&#39;t harm Carmilla too much!&quot;

      Tsuru let out a huge sigh of relief as Abby pulled Sakura away. The angel was still 
trying to purify Carmilla, but after Abby whispered calming words and smoothed out her 
ruffled feathers (literally), the angel calmed down.

      &quot;Ah... Carmilla... you can let go of me now,&quot; Tsuru said, not liking - but not hating 
- the feel of the woman&#39;s arms around her waist.

      &quot;Tsuru, I&#39;ve decided!&quot; The Lord of Demons groaned, realizing that Carmilla had utterly 
changed the subject. &quot;Even if your blood is the most vile thing I&#39;ve tasted in my hundred of 
years of vampirism, my affection and love for you still burns strong, if not brighter than 
before!&quot;

      Abby frowned and looked away. &quot;Damn, that&#39;s one cheesy vamp...&quot;

      Sakura gave her a lover a confused look. &quot;But I... I confess my love to you all the 
time...&quot;

      &quot;It&#39;s a lot different because you&#39;re so much sweeter,&quot; Abby murmured, nuzzling in to 
Sakura&#39;s neck. &quot;And it&#39;s... better because you gasp it out when we&#39;re in the middle of 
making love-&quot;

      Tycara proceeded to crawl off the couch and go find Seth in the living room. &quot;Icky...! 
Why do my mommies have to get like that whenever I&#39;m around...?&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;I feels a bit sudden,&quot; Krystal said, looking over Isaka, then Abby. &quot;But I guess 
we&#39;ll be back to visit pretty soon, huh?&quot;

      The couple was standing outside of the bed and breakfast, preparing to go back to the 
blonde&#39;s apartment. &quot;Well,&quot; Faye said. &quot;Another crisis will pop up in a week, so we&#39;ll be 
using your house as a base again.&quot;

      Erin gave her lover a knock on the head. &quot;Don&#39;t jinx it.&quot; Faye rubbed her head 
sheepishly.

      Abby rolled her eyes and stood aside from the door as Josh and Bakra made their way 
outside. It was almost like a lawn party... Next, Hina, Tsuki and Hoshi followed outside, 
having all their weapons and belongings with them.

      &quot;Thank you for letting us stay at your house,&quot; Hoshi said to Abby.

      The blonde woman just waved it off. &quot;No problem. I totally respect your wishes to do 
your sisterly bonding at your own home.&quot;

      Hoshi just stared at her in confusion. &quot;...what do you...?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, I was just saying that you three are probably going to-&quot;

      &quot;Well, what do you know Hoshi?&quot; Tsuru said suddenly, coming down the hallway. &quot;I think 
we need to get back to your shrine!&quot; She started to push the silver haired woman outside 
until she was a safe enough distance from Abby.

      Hoshi turned back to Tsuru. &quot;Mistress, what was that all about?&quot;

      &quot;Abby just says some weird things and- Wait! You&#39;re calling me that too...?&quot; Tsuru let 
out a groan. She really wished the three sisters would stop calling her that. It was 
especially weird coming from Hoshi who&#39;s age was technically 26-ish and Tsuru was younger 
than that when she stopped aging.

      The Lord of Demons looked around to see everyone giving out their goodbyes. Even Mina 
had stopped by to give everyone a send off... She snapped out of her daze when Sakura and 
Eveon came over.

      &quot;So you&#39;re going to stay at the shrine, right?&quot; Eveon asked.

      &quot;Yep, we&#39;re all going to be training there,&quot; Tsuru said with smile.

      &quot;You know, you can always come visit us,&quot; Hoshi said to Eveon. &quot;We could always teach 
you how to defend yourself in case something happens.&quot;

      Sakura suddenly spoke. &quot;That&#39;s... a good idea... but I don&#39;t think Mina would be 
too... happy...&quot;

      There was an awkward silence between all of them as they thought over the reason. 
Eveon, in a shrine with four other women, three of which who are involved in a polyamorous, 
incestual, slightly pedophilic and lesbian relationship? Mina wouldn&#39;t be too happy.

      Their silence was interrupted when Tsuru tried to duck behind Hoshi, but Carmilla 
already saw her. When Sakura laid eyes on the vampire, she immediately whisked Eveon away to 
prevent anymore chances of biting. Hoshi stole a peek at her mistress, who could hide very 
well behind her slender body, especially with her demon blade strapped to her back and the 
katana in her belt sticking out.

      &quot;Tsuru!&quot; Carmilla cried out happily, heading towards the young woman. It was then that 
she saw Hoshi standing in front of her object of affection and the vampire wasn&#39;t pleased at 
all. She stalked over, yanked Tsuru out of her hiding spot and glared at Hoshi.

      &quot;I know your little tricks!&quot; Carmilla told the silver haired woman. &quot;But I&#39;m not going 
to give up my Tsuru to your little sisterly harem - you can&#39;t fool me!&quot;

      Hoshi went bright red in the face, struggling with her embarrassment. &quot;B-b-but I... I 
didn&#39;t...? What are you talking about?&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t even try it - I know you all started calling her mistress and you&#39;re all 
planning to go stay at that little shrine out in the woods. And that&#39;s why,&quot; Carmilla said 
triumphantly. &quot;I&#39;m going to be staying there to make sure Tsuru is tempted by you three.&quot;

      &quot;You... you&#39;re going to stay with us...?&quot; Tsuru asked, trying to wrap her mind around 
the idea of Carmilla creeping around the house and randomly pouncing on her.

      Hoshi just slowly nodded her head. &quot;I... we... it&#39;s not in our training agenda to... 
uh... do that with our mistress. I suppose my sisters and I will prepare a room for you when 
we get there.&quot;

      Carmilla scoffed. &quot;Ha! Now I see... you&#39;re trying to lull me into a comfortable state 
by making me think that you&#39;re actually being kind to me. Nice try, but I won&#39;t let my guard 
down!&quot;

      Krystal and Isaka were watching the exchange happen on Abby&#39;s lawn. &quot;...Isn&#39;t Carmilla 
going overboard?&quot;

      Isaka shook her head. &quot;To be honest, if I were kept captive by those three for however 
long and half starved, I think I would be pretty vicious towards them. That and Tsuru is 
going to be living with a little harem that calls her &#39;mistress&#39; all the time.&quot;

      The exorcist sighed. &quot;I guess we should all get going, huh?&quot; 

***** 

      Isaka lied down lazily on the couch. They had only got back to Krystal&#39;s apartment 
when the blonde woman had to go vanquish a demon terrorizing a condominium. It was already 
late in the night and she hoped Krystal was alright... She jolted up when the telephone 
rang. Isaka looked around before finally sitting up and grabbing the wireless phone off the 
cradle.

      &quot;Hello?&quot;

      &quot;Isaka... I think I&#39;m going to die... can I just stay at Krystal&#39;s apartment with 
you?&quot;

      It was none other than Tsuru. Isaka, however, was mightily confused. &quot;What&#39;s going on? 
The sisters aren&#39;t secretly evil or anything are they?&quot;

      Tsuru whimpered over the line. &quot;...do you have time to listen? Some... weird stuff 
just happened today!&quot; 

***** 

      It had started as soon as they got there, with Tsuki wanting to take a light jog to 
clear her mind. Tsuru thought it was a fabulous idea and a way to ensure she wouldn&#39;t be 
caught alone by Carmilla. So they started their &#39;light&#39; jog with Tsuru suddenly realizing it 
wasn&#39;t as easy as she thought it would be. It was more like a sprint to the waterfall with 
the inhuman Tsuru tripping over the forest path as Tsuki went ahead confidently.

      &quot;What kind of jog was that?&quot; Tsuru asked, trying not to seem too winded as she sat 
down on one of the large stones by the riverbed.

      Tsuki just looked confused. &quot;My sisters and I take jogs even longer than that every 
morning. It&#39;s nothing weird to us.&quot;

      Tsuru let out a sigh, trying to mentally steel herself for how the rest of her life 
was going to be. Training, training, training. No wonder the sisters were capable of inhuman 
feats... She watched as Tsuki walked over to the waterfall and splashed some water into her 
face. &quot;Plus, it&#39;s nice to meditate here and relax...&quot; Tsuki murmured.

      Tsuru barely heard her over the sound of the small waterfall. Tsuki eventually joined 
her by the bank. &quot;I kind of wanted to come out here to think about what I&#39;m going to do...&quot;

      &quot;...do you want to talk about... something?&quot; Tsuru asked awkwardly. She wasn&#39;t exactly 
the greatest at consoling, but it was the least she could do.

      &quot;I just... it&#39;s going to be so weird living with my sisters and knowing that they want 
to...&quot; Tsuki trailed off as Tsuru quickly caught.

      &quot;It will be alright,&quot; the ebony haired woman said. &quot;They&#39;re still your sisters so they 
aren&#39;t going to do anything to hurt you.&quot;

      Tsuki smiled. &quot;Thanks. I assumed that would be the case, but...&quot; She turned to Tsuru. 
&quot;It&#39;s nice to hear someone else say it.&quot;

      It was then that the Lord of Demons noticed that the front of Tsuki&#39;s shirt had gotten 
wet when she washed her face. Really wet. And it was a white shirt. A wet, white shirt. She 
did the only appropriate thing one could do in such a situation. Tsuru stared.

      After a few minutes, Tsuki said, &quot;Maybe we should go back?&quot;

      Tsuru&#39;s head snapped up. &quot;Huh? Oh... oh! Yeah, we should!&quot;
