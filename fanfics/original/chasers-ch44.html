<a href="../original/chasers-ch43.html">Back to Part 43</a><pre>Dr. Alexis Jameson met Nyara&#39;s eyes, the black haired
psychiatrist scowling as she asked, &quot;Please tell me
you weren&#39;t responsible for the explosions...&quot;

The tawny haired sexaroid shook her head, the
beautiful woman looking unusually serious. &quot;No, we
didn&#39;t,&quot; Nyara said, &quot;and worse, we have no idea who
did.&quot;

Christa smiled grimly, the white haired woman standing
to one side of Alexis&#39; office, looking out the window
warily. Outside the city ran, just a week after the
bombings shook the city to the core, but the air
shimmered with tension. &quot;I see things are almost back
to normal up here,&quot; she turned to look at Alexis, &quot;did
you know much of Lowtown is still dark?&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Alexis met her eyes frankly, &quot;and most of
that is because of all the damage that rioters did
during the outage.&quot;

&quot;The fact we don&#39;t have money had nothing to do with
it?&#39; Nyara asked wryly.

Alexis sighed, &quot;I&#39;m not even going to try to defend
that.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t have to,&quot; Christa gentled her tone. The
taller woman walked over to Nyara&#39;s side, &quot;As you can
guess, things are tense down in Lowtown.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s an understatement,&quot; Alexis agreed.

In a not so surprising move an alliance of the
downtrodden in the lowest parts of the city had seized
the initiative, deciding to measure out some vengeance
against those they deemed had hurt them. Armored
stores belonging to various corporations were overrun,
looted, as were the offices of city government. The
rioters had even managed to surround the police
stations, though that didn&#39;t last long. A relief force
from the upper levels helped free the officers, but in
the end they had been forced to abandon several of the
stations.

&quot;Things are starting to settle down a bit,&quot; Nyara
chided her lover Christa, &quot;I think we&#39;ll be ready to
send a delegation to the mayor soon.&quot;

&quot;Assuming he&#39;ll see you,&quot; Alexis noted, moving to pour
her guests some tea. &quot;How did you get up here?&quot; She
looked curious, &quot;I thought the lifts were cut off from
the lowest levels and the emergency ladders were being
guarded.&quot;

&quot;The guards were susceptible by bribery,&quot; Christa
shrugged.

&quot;Still,&quot; Alexis passed them the cups, &quot;you took quite
a risk coming up here.&quot;

Nyara took a drink with remarkable grace, all part of
her fine programming. &quot;I&#39;m here to give you this,&quot; she
explained, taking out a small communications link and
handing it over.

&quot;This is...?&quot; Alexis picked it up tentatively.

&quot;Nothing illegal,&quot; Christa reassured her, &quot;we just
want to maintain communications with someone up here,
in case things get worse.&quot;

Alexis put it in a pocket as she said, &quot;I&#39;m not
entirely comfortable with is, but I want to help.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nyara bowed slightly.

Alexis hesitated then she asked, &quot;I was wondering, how
are Yume and Ariko?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re fine,&quot; Christa reassured her with a grin,
&quot;actually they&#39;re running a improvised medical center
we set up. Turns out our big butch Yume has some
medical experience, and where ever she goes Ariko
follows.&quot;

&quot;I noticed,&quot; Alexis flashed a smile.

Christa looked at the watch imprinted on the sleeve of
her busineswear and said to Nyara, &quot;We&#39;d better get
going, love.&quot;

Alexis looked at the two of them, &quot;Are you going to be
all right returning Lowtown tonight? I could offer you
a room...&quot;

Nyara chuckled as she shook Alexis&#39; hand, &quot;No, we
should be good. We&#39;ve got several routes ready to
return by, if needed.&quot;

&quot;Then good luck,&quot; Alexis said, &quot;and I&#39;ll keep in
touch.&quot;

In Lowtown, the normally dim light was worse than
ever, smoke rolling amid the bases of the giant towers
of the building. A woman warily walked the halls, her
eyes scanning every step until she reached the right
section of the building. Seeing the door broken down
Kate Williams muffled a cry of alarm, the sandy haired
woman hurrying forward. The almost too thin woman
climbed over the wreckage, looking about wildly as she
hurried in.

A soft moan brought Kate&#39;s head up and she called,
&quot;Silver?&quot;

&quot;Here...&quot; the moaning voice was soft, painful.

Racing to the back bedroom Kate saw two women
crouching on the floor, one of them hurt. Silver&#39;s arm
hung limp, useless, and her artificial flesh was torn
around the upper and lower arm. Beside her Kari tried
to tend to her wounds, her blue hair ragged and matted
with filth.

&quot;You,&quot; Kari looked at Kate wide eyed.

Kate rushed to their side even as she pulled her
backpack off, nearly catching her leather jacket on it
in her haste. &quot;How badly are you hurt?&quot; she asked both
as she dug out the human and android medical kits she
had brought.

&quot;Check over Kari first,&quot; Silver groaned, her shining
hair now dusty.

&quot;Stop being noble,&quot; Kari growled to her before looking
to Kate. &quot;Her arm got banged up protecting me from a
would-be-rapist,&quot; Kari said bitterly, &quot;I only got
knocked around a bit.&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;ll look at you next,&quot; Kate said as she looked
over at the wound to Silver&#39;s arm.

&quot;How did you...?&quot; Silver met Kate&#39;s eyes in obvious
question.

With a surprising degree of skill Kate took a packet
of artificial flesh and began to thread it into the
damaged sections of Silver&#39;s arm. &quot;The guards on the
lift owed me a favor,&quot; Kate said simply.

&quot;But why come down here?&quot; Kari blurted, &quot;You could be
arrested by your own side, not to mention most of the
folks down here hate cops!&quot;

Finished with the repairs to muscle Kate took patches
of artificial skin out and set them in place over the
exposed flesh. &quot;I was worried,&quot; Kate shrugged
uncomfortably, &quot;I couldn&#39;t reach Silver and none of my
contacts here knew anything.&quot;

Silver reached out to stroke her arm, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Embarrassed Kate looked over at Kari and gruffly said,
&quot;Let&#39;s check you over, too.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kari smiled tiredly. Other than bruises and
cuts she was mostly all right, Silver was relieved to
hear, and soon the three of them were ready to go.

Kate picked up her pack and slung it over her
shoulder, her jeans and T-shirt nearly as dusty as
Kari and Silver&#39;s clothes. &quot;The way I see it you&#39;ve
got three options,&quot; she said as they climbed over
debris to escape the suite, &quot;I can take you uptown
with me, you can join up with the provisional
government here or I can drop you off at the first
aide center/refugee camp.&quot;

&quot;Kate, you don&#39;t need to...&quot; Silver started.

&quot;I know you&#39;re independent and capable,&quot; Kate said
firmly, &quot;and I respect that. I&#39;m just here to help, if
you&#39;ll let me.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d seriously bring us uptown with you?&quot; Kari asked
after a moment, her young voice filled with surprise.

&quot;Silver&#39;s my... friend,&quot; Kate said with a bit of a
blush, &quot;and you&#39;re her friend.&quot; A shrug and she added,
&quot;It&#39;s just that simple.&quot;

Smoothly Silver kissed Kate, the motion surprising the
taller woman. &quot;You&#39;re not as tough as you&#39;d like
people to think,&quot; she sighed happily.

Kari fought back a smile, seeing how flustered Kate
was. &quot;I think the goons who attacked us are the types
fighting for the government here,&quot; she said as they
reached the stairs, &quot;signing up with them is not
something I want to do.&quot;

Kate&#39;s lips thinned as she pressed them together
angrily. &quot;I suppose you don&#39;t remember what they
looked like?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about running around trying to
avenge our honor,&quot; Silver said firmly. After a moment
she said, &quot;As much as I&#39;m tempted, I think you should
take us to the first aide station.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Kate started.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Silver shushed her as they walked to ground
level, &quot;you and I both know the sort of trouble you&#39;d
get into bringing us back with you. I care for you
enough not to want to do that to you.&quot;</pre>
