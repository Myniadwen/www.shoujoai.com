She jerked in her seat for the last time as the bus came to a halt. They 
were, aptly put, in the middle of nowhere, she and the bus driver. He 
leaned back and looked at her as if he was not entirely certain this 
woman knew where she was going.

&quot;Last stop,&quot; he said warily. She blinked and peered out the window. They 
were in a vast stretch of nothing, mere sand and rock; the closest point 
of civilization was a mile away. &quot;You gotta get off here,&quot; said the 
driver. &quot;I can&#39;t take you back.&quot; The woman stood, and reasoned that this 
was as good a place as any to continue her journey. He had taken her as 
far as he could; the rest she would have to do on her own. She walked up 
to the front, passing him as she got off.

&quot;You sure this is your stop?&quot; he asked. He didn&#39;t get an answer. She 
watched the bus turn around and go back the other way. She walked in the 
direction she chose&#151;south, towards the town, though she didn&#39;t know 
this&#151;and kept to the path for a day. The woman was filthy, starving, and 
exhausted by the time she reached the old place, a phenomenon that had 
not yet happened to her. She did not know the frailty of the human body 
until she had lived in it. Vaguely she searched the town, too weary to 
kill, too puzzled to move.

She went into a restaurant, killed until she had privacy, and ate to her 
heart&#39;s content. She let herself inside a person&#39;s house, stripped off 
her ratty clothes, and bathed, with their body hanging from a hook. She 
stole more clothes and went to sleep in the man&#39;s bed. Nobody disturbed 
her, because she in fact had disturbed everybody, and they knew better 
than to approach the woman who had killed so many of their own.

The goddess of death woke up the next morning&#151;fittingly, in a graveyard 
just outside the town.

Not yet being a month old, she did not understand the purpose of the 
place, nor why it was so empty, nor why it gave her a sense of peace 
being there&#151;like it was home. She wandered the tombs blindly, stumbling 
about on unsure legs, searching for something mysterious. A fog rose in 
the morning light, and birds croaked overhead. She came across a 
mausoleum and went inside; it was there, of all places, where she met 
the one she had been seeking.

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never show up,&quot; he said impatiently. &quot;I told you I&#39;d 
find you, but it certainly took awhile. It looks like you had to go and 
find me.&quot; The lady was mute. He was ghastly and pale, like a corpse that 
did not yet know of its death, and cloaked in a habit. Smiling, he 
shuffled towards her&#151;she decided to kill him. The weapon snapped out and 
became a whip, but all she could do was raise it: it could not fall, no 
matter how hard she willed it. The man simply could not be killed by her 
efforts. She struggled and ground her teeth, but it was in vain. He 
sighed, lowered her arm, and stared into her eyes, his own red and dull.

&quot;Did you really think I&#39;d let my own creation have that kind of power? 
No, my dear, you could not kill me, not by any means. You were not meant 
to. But you will soon be glad of it, I assure you. I&#39;ve come to bring 
you home, where you are going to start what we finished so long ago.&quot; 
She tried to speak, but her voice was caught. This man... Whoever he 
was, she did not know him, but something in the back of her infantile 
mind told her he was important, he was to be obeyed, he was...Master. 
Somehow he was.

&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Can&#39;t speak? It&#39;s no surprise, you were 
just born a week or two ago by my reckoning. It&#39;s a miracle you managed 
to walk this far! So how many have you killed since you woke up and 
became sentient, my dear? Fifty? Sixty? Bah! You&#39;re still just a baby. 
Back in the old days, you could wipe out entire countries in a matter of 
weeks! But this place is different, this time is different. People are 
more resilient here, and you were just &#145;born&#39; not long ago. Well, speak! 
You&#39;ve got the power, so why not say something? Or do you choose to be 
mute?&quot;

She wanted to talk, really she did, but what to say? A hundred questions 
came up, a hundred thoughts and a hundred feelings. Things started 
rushing at her quickly, like the fall of rain from the sky, pelting her 
endlessly&#151;but above all else, one thing embraced her young mind the 
strongest, something so powerful and abominable that it preceded 
everything else, even her own identity.

&quot;...Where&#39;s my sister?&quot;

.........

His name was Malchior, the Scion of Darkness, and he had been around 
long enough to see the future turn into ancient history. He was old, 
old, terribly old, and terribly wrought from the years; his skin was 
pale and wrinkly, hair white as a winter sky, eyes terribly bloodshot 
and teeth rotting. He sounded like a frog on the verge of death, and 
shuffled so slowly that it would take him a day to reach the room next 
door. Yet the woman knew not to kill him, not to hate him&#151;and not to 
trust him. He called her Kali, the goddess of death. Kali. Her name was 
Kali.

&quot;Is it coming back to you?&quot; he asked, referring to her memory. She 
swallowed.

&quot;Do you know where my sister is?&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, your memory must be in excellent condition if you remember 
that. Ha! Of all the details of your former lives to recall, you summon 
up that one! Amazing. The bond between you two is even stronger than I 
thought. Truly amazing.&quot;

&quot;...Where is she?&quot; He grinned.

&quot;One thing at a time, miss. You&#39;re still just learning to walk. You&#39;re 
not quite at the level where you can go about crusading for lost family 
members. Meeting me should be enough for one day, yes. I&#39;d be happy to 
answer any other questions you may have.&quot; Kali paused, and stared at her 
hands. After the eternal sea, they had been the first things she gazed 
upon after birth. She stared at them again, old familiar friends, 
already drenched with blood.

&quot;Tell me about myself.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll recall everything you need to know in time.&quot;

&quot;Tell me about that energy weapon I had.&quot;

&quot;Ah, that was my master&#39;s creation, a man whose skills I am unworthy of 
replicating. He was brilliant and cruel; he taught me well, though I was 
his elder even in those days. How do you like it?&quot;

&quot;It is...magnificent,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Unbound, unlike traditional 
weapons, and unchallenged in power. Much like myself.&quot;

&quot;Yes indeed, much like yourself, Kali. It&#39;s a proper tool for you to 
use.&quot; She paused and started to think of more questions to ask.

&quot;Where is my sis&#151;I mean, I should probably ask...what is my purpose in 
this life?&quot;

&quot;The same as it was in your previous two lives,&quot; he answered quietly. 
&quot;Once we find your sister, the two of you are to bring order to this 
world. You shall reign it eternally, the two of you, and keep the human 
beings from obliterating themselves! I know that will soon be their fate 
if they are left unchecked. They must have stern shepherds to guide 
them.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, my two previous lives?&quot; The Dark Scion scowled.

&quot;It is...a matter of no importance.&quot;

&quot;I want to know.&quot; He coughed.

&quot;You were simply killed, that&#39;s all! Though it took a calamity to 
destroy you both times. Yet I did not give up. I simply...waited for the 
times to change, for people to become fat and lazy again. This time I 
believed I reached the proper period.&quot;

&quot;Was I created?&quot;

&quot;Yes, indeed. It took me countless ages to perfect the art, and I had to 
find suitable homunculi to fit your wild souls into. I must say, after 
the first prototype, I was loathe to change your appearance, or your 
sister&#39;s. You look exactly the same as the very first day of your first 
life.&quot;

&quot;So I am...just a created being, made by you.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s really no different from being a human,&quot; he answered. &quot;God made 
Man from the dust of the earth, and then He created Woman from Man&#39;s 
flesh. I merely...improved the model. You could go so far as to say that 
you, my dear, are an evolved human.&quot; Kali was silent as she stared into 
the distance. Her hand clenched and unclenched. She did not move, or 
speak. Malchior cackled softly, and shuffled towards her.

&quot;Satisfied? I can answer more questions if you have them.&quot;

&quot;Where is my sister?&quot;

&quot;Got a one-track mind, huh? Not that I blame you; I made you to have 
that desire. Well, the short answer is I don&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t know where 
you were when you were born, I just knew that you&#39;d come to me. You were 
inexplicably drawn to me, as I made you to be. Your 
sister...unfortunately, must be found.&quot;

&quot;Won&#39;t she come here too?&quot;

&quot;No, I couldn&#39;t make her that way. Creating two identical women was 
pointless; you both needed a distinct personality to truly be complete. 
You, Kali, are the dark goddess of death. You are like a plague, like a 
disaster, destroying and slaughtering in the masses. That&#39;s what you&#39;re 
supposed to do.&quot;

&quot;And my sister?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t know yet? Oh, very well: Celine is the light goddess of 
death, like old age. A more peaceful kind of death. Similar, but very 
different. Understand?&quot; Kali blinked and breathed the name of the woman 
she was connected to, from time immemorial:

Celine...

&quot;That is her name,&quot; she said. &quot;The name of my sister. She is...Celine.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Kali turned to face Malchior, and frowned.

&quot;I shall never be a substitute for her, old fool.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; His face twisted. She snarled.

&quot;I shall never be Venus. Nor shall my sister. Nor the child you intend 
for us to bear. We shall never be captives of your heart.&quot;

&quot;Kali...what the hell do you mean? How could you...&quot; He was too shocked 
to even stand; he collapsed and rasped with great difficulty. She walked 
over, unable to even kick him, but there were other pains she could 
inflict.

&quot;I remember it all now. In the brief time it takes a person to conceive 
thought, I have been given a revelation. I know it all now&#151;who I am, 
what I was meant for, everything. I no longer need you. I shall not be 
your whore.&quot;

&quot;Kali...you could not...have known that...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll leave you be,&quot; she said wickedly, turning round to part. &quot;You can 
go and resurrect something and get it to do your bidding and hold you in 
the night. Or stalk some poor person and suck their life dry. I honestly 
don&#39;t even care if you rot to death right here and now. I&#39;ll leave you 
be and make my own way in life, and when I find my sister, we&#39;ll show 
you just how great a menace you&#39;ve made. Odd, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she said as a 
final thought. &quot;That Man could fall by choice, by want, that he could 
rebel from his own Creator. And now there&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;KALI!!&quot; She did not even turn to look back as she walked away from the 
mausoleum and the graveyard, her destiny now clear, her path bright and 
shining. No more confusion. No more childishness. Kali knew precisely 
what she wanted to do, and where she wanted to go, and how she would do 
it. She was on the move again, this time with a clear purpose, and all 
the deadlier for it.

......

Malchior stood to his feet and limped out of the mausoleum, cursing Kali 
and his ancient legs. He breathed heavily and studied the graveyard, 
wondering if he could sink so low as to heed his own creation&#39;s advice. 
As if the master should obey their servant! But he had no choice, he was 
old and weary, and in need of new life. He nearly fainted before coming 
across a lonely gravedigger, finishing the last of his work. He gave a 
start and turned, pointing a flashlight at the ancient man.

&quot;What the devil are you?&quot; he wondered, staring hard. In that light, 
Malchior looked more like a specter than a man, and snarled as the light 
blinded him. With the last of his strength he attacked, embracing the 
man with his frail arms, drawing upon his life-force until nothing was 
left but a corpse&#151;ready to do his master&#39;s bidding. Malchior stood, 
refreshed to some degree, feeling decades younger.

&quot;Ah, that&#39;s better,&quot; he sighed, parting back his milky hair. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
think I&#39;d last any longer. You,&quot; he coughed, kicking the zombie, &quot;go and 
see if there aren&#39;t any others wandering this place. Find them and bring 
them to me. We&#39;ll have a family of undead in no time at all.&quot; Wordlessly 
the creature obeyed, and lumbered off to search for the living. Malchior 
took a deep breath, glanced at the ground&#151;and smiled. A spider was at 
his foot, like a little dog pawing for scraps. Gently he bent down, took 
the animal in his hand, and ate it.

The zombie he sent out was worth more than he bargained, for it had 
gathered three people in a short time, and had subdued every one of 
them, mostly with just its awful presence. Malchior grinned and praised 
the creature: it had brought a strapping man in his thirties, a young 
girl, and a slightly older gentleman who had fainted along the way. 
Combined, they would probably shave at least a century off of his 
appearance and give him quite a few more years. His mouth salivated 
hungrily at the thought of absorbing so much energy.

&quot;Wonderful!&quot; he howled. The zombie held the young man and girl tight as 
Malchior pounced on the old man first, draining him of his brief 
remaining years. He did not visibly grow young yet, but felt as if he 
could start walking upright, and not scurry like some hunchback. He 
stared at the girl next, knowing she would bring him unbelievable 
potential. The second zombie took hold of her in its arms as she 
screamed helplessly.

A flash of otherworldly light overcame the cemetery, bringing morning to 
the darkness briefly and sending the zombies crumbling to dust. Malchior 
scowled and shielded his sensitive eyes from the blinding light; the man 
and the girl gasped in awe.

&quot;An angel!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;An angel!!&quot;

&quot;Run! Quickly!&quot; A strong voice called out to them, and they were gone 
before Malchior could even cry out. The light faded soon, enabling him 
to turn around to glare at the one who had interfered. When he saw the 
vision, though, he trembled and fell to his knees. It was, as the girl 
had described, an angel, though seemingly as dark and wretched as he. It 
had a companion, too, one who was more shadow than flesh.

&quot;You have stolen enough life for one day,&quot; spoke the angel firmly. &quot;Is 
it not enough that people suffer through casual means every day? Do you 
need to add to their troubles with your defilements? Begone from this 
place, wretched man, and do not sin ever again, lest I shall find you 
and make you suffer ten times what you have wrought!&quot;

&quot;O, my master,&quot; he wailed, bowing at the two dark creatures; &quot;O, my 
completeness! My entirety, my grace, my banner, my steadfast rock!&quot;

&quot;Stop that!&quot; snarled the shadow, kicking him soundly. &quot;You disgust me.&quot;

&quot;Forgive me!&quot; he wailed&#151;but the two seemed to ignore him. The angel 
spoke to their companion.

&quot;Come, Amielle, let us go. Leave this one.&quot;

&quot;With pleasure,&quot; she snorted. The angel and the shadow were gone before 
Malchior could notice it; he stood, quivering, shaken from his 
revelation. Had the gods of the dark finally paid him a visit, and found 
him lacking? Were they so sick of him that they would deny him his right 
to life? Did they intend for him to live the rest of his years in 
reform?

&quot;I must pursue them,&quot; he whispered to himself. &quot;They are what I have 
been dreaming about! O, Kali, that you were loyal! For the third time, I 
have been duped by my horrible heart! My Venus...ever elusive! Oh, my 
Kali, my Celine, where could you be, O my Venus?&quot; He wailed and wailed, 
until the morning light&#151;the honest light of the creeping sun&#151;forced him 
back into hiding.

Just for a moment, though. He&#39;d be out and about, wreaking havoc, in no 
time.

----------

To be continued...

As Kali and the Dark Scion go down their different paths, another evil 
makes its presence known in the world. Seven Sins bring disaster to an 
unsuspecting world, led by a mysterious man in black. What are their 
motives? What is the ultimate goal of the one called Omega? Only some 
questions will have answers in the next chapter, &quot;The Seven&quot;. Stay
