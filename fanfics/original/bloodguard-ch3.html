<h1>Bloody Guardian (part 3 of 7)</h1>

<a href="../original/bloodguard-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Out front the speakeasy was silent, the threat of a
raid having sent all the flappers and their beaus home
for the night, but behind the false cafe things were
getting exciting. The tommy gun loudly rattled off
it&#39;s shots as Heather moved, the tall woman racing
pantherlike through the darkened warehouse. Her long
black haired flowed behind her as she brutally
disarmed the man, ripping the gun away from him along
with a few bloody fingers. His choked off cry of pain
was cut off as she lunged, drinking deep from the run
runner&#39;s throat as he struggled weakly, finally
slumping still.

&quot;Disgusting,&quot; Heather hissed to herself as she coldly
cast the body away. Her eyes swept the hall, studying
the barrels of booze, then she strode towards them.
Each punch burst the kegs open, spilling cheap booze
out onto the floor, filling the air with the scent.

&quot;You done?&quot; the young man&#39;s voice asked.

Heather calmly walked away from the spilling booze to
where he stood in the doorway, studying him warily.
&quot;Just about Wilson,&quot; she answered him coldly, &quot;so, are
you going to call your bosses to gloat about this?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Wilson shook his head firmly, brown hair hid
beneath his fedora, his suit still crisp and mostly
neat. A smile, &quot;You and I both know we can&#39;t report
this.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Heather admitted. She gave him a look,
&quot;I&#39;m doing this for my own reasons, not for your damn
crusade.&quot;

&quot;I know&quot; there was a softness in Wilson&#39;s voice, &quot;I
loved her, too.&quot;

&quot;Hmph,&quot; obviously Heather did not want to be reminded
of that.

They stood together beneath the moon&#39;s silver light as
Wilson lit up a home-made wooden torch, then he
carefully tossed it underhanded into the otherwise
empty building. In a few moments the warehouse was
fully ablaze, the fire lighting up the night around
them as the booze and contraband within went up in
smoke.

&quot;We&#39;re hurting them by doing this,&quot; Heather said to
him quietly, &quot;but I want more... I want the boss, and
I want the man who killed her.&quot;

&quot;We may never get them,&quot; Wilson admitted, &quot;or at least
I won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not so easy for me to do, too,&quot; Heather quietly
admitted, &quot;the Don is the most paranoid man I&#39;ve
encountered, he&#39;s surrounded by guards.&quot;

Wilson gave her a thoughtful look, wondering at the
admiration he heard in her voice. &quot;Does that mean
you&#39;re giving up?&quot; he asked her.

Heather barked a bitter laugh. &quot;No,&quot; she said firmly,
&quot;I swore on Lily&#39;s grave that I&#39;d make them regret
killing her.&quot; A cold smile, &quot;All it means is that
this&#39;ll take some time... and time is something I have
in plenty.&quot;

&quot;What are you?&quot; Wilson finally made himself ask the
question that had hovered on his lips since he had
first met her, months ago.

&quot;Do you really want to know?&quot; Heather asked curiously.

&quot;Yes, I think I do,&quot; Wilson said after a moment,
studying her blue, almost black colored eyes and
parchment pale skin. .

&quot;You may not believe it but I&#39;m a vampire,&quot; Heather
said, confessing something she had rarely revealed to
men before.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Wilson said softly.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Heather raised a single eyebrow.

&quot;I guessed, but I wanted to know for sure,&quot; Wilson
admitted. They stood there silently a moment, &quot;Is
there anything I can do to help?&quot;

&quot;Not for what I&#39;ll be doing,&quot; there was a touch of
gentleness in Heather&#39;s voice, &quot;besides, you know that
Lily would want you to stay out of something like
this.&quot;

Wilson finally moved away from her, heading towards
where his Ford was sitting not too far away. &quot;I never
understood what you and my sister had,&quot; he said
quietly, &quot;but I&#39;m glad she knew you... for however
long it lasted.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; and Heather silently disappeared into the
night.



Professor Sharon D&#39;Angelo blinked in surprise as the
brown haired scholar listened to the intense young
woman rip apart her discussion on Prohibition, not to
mention refuting almost all of her arguments on
banning illegal narcotics. &quot;Well,&quot; she fought back
painful tears as she collected her papers and left the
stage, &quot;please excuse me.&quot;

The tall young woman reached Sharon before she could
flee the room, her expression faintly compassionate.
&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Prof. D&#39;Angelo,&quot; she said quietly.

Sharon clenched her jaw, then released it as she tried
to control her emotions. She wasn&#39;t used to talking
about her work in a open forum like this, nor had she
expected a expert to be dwelling in the audience to
ambush her. &quot;Nothing to be sorry for,&quot; Sharon said
stiffly.

&quot;I think there is,&quot; she met Sharon&#39;s gaze with true
compassion. &quot;Occasionally I get so caught up in the
argument, I lose sight of the person I&#39;m fighting
with,&quot; she explained.

Part of Sharon wanted to stay mad, but she found it
impossible to do so under those kind eyes. &quot;Apology
accepted Miss...?&quot;

&quot;Heather McKennit,&quot; she introduced herself with a nod.

They walked away from the lecture hall together as
Sharon looked at her curiously, &quot;Do you really believe
in legalizing addictive drugs?&quot;

Heather shrugged eloquently. &quot;More honestly, I don&#39;t
see much alternative,&quot; she admitted, &quot;the war on drugs
seems to have been a spectacular failure.&quot;

&quot;I liked your argument that we were only helping keep
the prices up,&quot; Sharon murmured wryly, &quot;with all our
drug seizures.&quot;

Heather flashed a smile, &quot;Not my line, of course, but
it is a good one.&quot; They walked through the halls of
the college a bit, &quot;I suppose I couldn&#39;t take you out
to coffee or something?&quot;

Sharon looked at Heather with surprise, a bit of blush
coloring her cheeks. There was something oddly
charming about her, this striking dark beauty who
stood beside her. She could feel her heart race, her
palms sweat, but she didn&#39;t know why. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot;
Sharon croaked.

&quot;Good,&quot; Heather flashed a charming smile, and Sharon
early melted.

They shared a drink at the cafe, conversation flowing
easily, then Sharon surprised herself again by
inviting her home. Heather and her were silent as they
went to Sharon&#39;s bedroom, the taller woman gracefully
taking charge. With a smile Heather stripped her,
kissing softly, then lay her down on the bed before
proceeding to make love to Sharon very, very
thoroughly.

Later Heather rose from the bed, looking down at the
sleeping woman thoughtfully, then bent down to bite
gently at her neck. She didn&#39;t take much, just enough
blood to ensure the younger woman would sleep the rest
of the dead for a few hours. She dressed quickly then
stalked through the halls of the old mansion,
following a layout she had memorized days earlier.

The old man lay in a bedroom on the first floor, tubes
and wires connecting him to various monitoring
devices. Once a big, strong man age and illness had
withered him to nothing, leaving a broken husk behind.
Lionel D&#39;Angelo, once the drug lord of the east side
and king of the speakeasies, was now reduced to this.

Something, some unknown instinct awakened the gray
haired old man and he blinked, looking up at her with
a oddly blank expression on his face. &quot;Who are you?&quot;
he croaked then asked, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

Heather let some of her unearthly aspect free, her
eyes glittering in the shadows. &quot;Just checking my
handiwork,&quot; she answered softly, &quot;the car accident in
&#39;69, the attack in &#39;80, the car bombing... they all
put you here.&quot;

&quot;You were.. responsible for that?&quot; Lionel blinked
blood shot eyes at her, hazy with pain. &quot;Why?&#39; he
managed to wheeze.

&quot;Do you remember Lily Wilson?&quot; Heather asked.

&quot;Who?&quot; he blinked at her in incomprehension, then the
ill man paled even more as her face darkened with
rage.

&quot;She was a waitress in a little cafe downtown,&quot;
Heather growled, &quot;just a nobody, a ordinary woman. She
was unlucky enough to spot you and your men moving a
shipment of booze... and you killed her for it.&quot;

&quot;All of this,&quot; Lionel weakly gestured to his mangled
body, &quot;was because of that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s little enough, I think,&quot; Heather purred darkly.

&quot;Kill me,&quot; the old man murmured as she moved to go,
&quot;please.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not finished punishing you yet.&quot;</pre>
