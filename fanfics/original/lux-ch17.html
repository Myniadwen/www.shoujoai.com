<B><P>Episode XVII:  Slough of Depravity</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;The only person Kagai Shazou trusted in his life was his bodyguard, the silent and ruthlessly obedient Scarlet.  He once trusted many more people, but betrayal and falsehood had killed his belief in the humanity of humans.  He had once been a proud nobleman, ruling justly and fairly with a taste of force behind the grasp of his fist, but now he had forced himself into hiding, away from those he hated most so that he could plan their deaths piece by piece.  He even concealed his beautifully haunting identity with a face mask, one that forbade all save his closest to gaze upon his icy-calm fa&ccedil;ade.</P>
<P>&#9;Joining up with Grady and Galaga was a risky and somewhat hypocritical move for him, because out of all three of them, he was the least depraved and his quest was by far the most pure.  He was wicked, of course, for he had planned the murder of at least a hundred different people and had even slain his own father, but Kagai expressed justification behind every single one of his actions, evil or otherwise.  He could always count on Scarlet, though, who would stay by her master’s side even if he were cast into a lake of fire.  She would just leap in after him, dragging him to safety despite personal injury.</P>
<P>&#9;Kagai was a very attractive young man; rich even though he was in hiding, and still very powerful.  His mask covered a face marred by angst, betrayal, and brilliance, and the silvery hair that flowed down his face made him seem all the more ethereal.  He wore suits fit for a nobleman, flowing clothes that stank of wealth and power, and had the body of a professional fighter, a deadly sting behind the beauty.  He was tall, and could be menacing when he wanted to, though his voice had no more emotion in it than a hollow metal tube.  The only person he ever truly loved was his mother; the only one he ever trusted was Scarlet, and everyone else was mere fodder, worthy only of his hate and contempt.</P>
<P>&#9;Still, Kagai could become incredibly curious and impatient.  He was left in the dark when it came to the motives of his two allies, and even though he had a faint grasp on the situation, he still didn’t quite know what they were up to.  He could speak with Grady about the matter without a problem, but in the company of the lustful Galaga, he feared being tempted to slay her.  He planned on speaking with the old tyrant sometime later that day, after completing his plans of death for three of his enemies, but Galaga was another story.  He could only send in Scarlet, who would not kill the woman unless asked.  She would be best-suited to drive information out of Galaga, eve though Kagai hated sending his trusted protector into her den.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“Lady Scarlet,” he said suddenly.  The tall, plain-looking, long-haired woman at his side turned to face him.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes, Master?”</P>
<P>&#9;“My allies have too many secrets, would you agree?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes,” she answered simply.</P>
<P>&#9;“I would like to unravel these mysteries as quickly as possible so that I shall be better prepared in the event that something happens.  Knowledge is power, Scarlet, and I think it an insult that I am left out of their plans.  This is an alliance of three mad people bent on teaming up to fulfill their own goals, yet we have accomplished little on our own.  Perhaps I may be able to help them in exchange for their help.”</P>
<P>&#9;“That would seem wisest,” she agreed blandly.  Scarlet sounded just as emotional about things as her master did.</P>
<P>&#9;“Grady and I can safely chat without fear of manipulation or treason, but it is Galaga that I do not wish to encounter.  If I am within her vicinity, I would be tempted to insert this sword of mine into her chest, and cut it open to see if she truly has a heart.  You are the only one I trust to be around her without entertaining thoughts of her death.  I trust that you will speak to her and attain the information I need.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I will if you ask me of it,” she replied.  “Though if you’ll forgive me, I detest her equally.  I would not even look at her if you did not wish it.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I understand your enmity quite well,” he assured her.  “But this is the only way I may be successful.  If I can help her, then she would help me.”</P>
<P>&#9;“For that hope alone, I will carry out your request.”  Scarlet bowed to her master, and asked him what he needed to know.</P>
<P>&#9;“Starik keeps referring to her daughter.  She seems obsessed with retrieving her.  I would like every last shred of detail you can possibly attain from her, concerning this young child.  Can you do that?”</P>
<P>&#9;“I can do anything my master wishes,” she swore, bowing once again.  Kagai thanked her, and watched as Scarlet silently left his room and went in search of Galaga Starik, a woman who resembled a snake more than a human.  Scarlet hated approaching the woman, especially after their night of abominable passion, but she was so dedicated to her master and so willing to commit to his wishes that she would even take her own life, if she felt it would serve his purpose.  Withstanding Galaga Starik would hurt in more ways than one, but it would be worth it in the long run.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"></P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;As Scarlet was bade entrance to Galaga’s room, she saw the older, dark-skinned woman communicating to her inferior officers at the slave trade.  Whenever she wasn’t pleasuring herself or slinking around in secret, Galaga was organizing the entire galaxy into slavery, commanding the lives of men and women everywhere.  She loved the power, and loved anyone who wielded similar strength with an insane passion, thus her heavily unrequited lust for Kagai.  She had once even lusted after Scarlet, who was as forbidden and unreachable to the woman as a golden apple suspended in the sky.</P>
<P>&#9;Scarlet did not bother to make her presence known as she invited herself into Galaga’s small, darkly-lit room.  A hypnotic scent floated in the air, most likely used to control the minds of the weak, but both Scarlet and her master were too strong-willed to be subdued.  Shazou’s bodyguard merely stood there, as far away from Starik as possible while the woman was working.  Finally, regrettably, Starik completed her task for the hour and turned around, giving her unexpected guest a coy smile.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah, lady Scarlet…  Why have you returned?  Does your master request my presence again?”</P>
<P>&#9;“No, he asks of information concerning your daughter,” reported the younger woman.  Scarlet was not one to beat around the bush--straight, simple honesty was more her style.</P>
<P>&#9;“My daughter?” replied Galaga, raising a thin brown eyebrow.  “What do you mean?”</P>
<P>&#9;“He wants to know anything and everything.  He wishes to be totally informed, so that he might help you in your situation.  He believes that if he helps you out, you would be willing to help him out as well.”</P>
<P>&#9;“True, but all he has to do is ask,” replied Galaga with a smile.  Scarlet frowned.</P>
<P>&#9;“He would be far too tempted to kill you.  I am here in his stead, giving you this request.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Ahh, how noble of you,” she sang, slowly getting out of her chair and slinking over to the tall woman.  “So you would like me to tell you everything about my daughter and what I plan to do once I find her, am I right?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah, but that information doesn’t come without a price,” purred Starik as she walked closer.  “You’re going to have to do me a favor first.”  Inwardly, Scarlet snarled and barely contained the bile forming up inside her stomach and throat.  Doing favors for Galaga Starik was actually less stimulating than wrestling with a cactus, and probably more painful as well.  But Scarlet’s loyalty for her master was infinite, and she would have fought a thousand cacti if he asked her to.</P>
<P>&#9;“What did you have in mind?” she muttered bitterly.  Galaga, satisfied that the tall, plain, dusky woman was now on her leash, smiled wickedly and trailed her finger across Scarlet’s jaw.  The woman didn’t stiffen, even though it took a lot of resolve to keep still.</P>
<P>&#9;“I want you to give me the ultimate sexual pleasure,” she hissed.  “Become my lover, just for a moment, and give me the most amazing moment of forbidden lovemaking that I’ve ever felt.  If you do a good job, I’ll tell you everything you want to know.  Just make sure you have a piece of paper handy.  You may want to take notes.”</P>
<P>&#9;“My memory is exceptional,” muttered Scarlet, almost unable to keep the bile from erupting out.  She had expected no less from the depraved woman, no less at all.</P>
<P>&#9;“So, do we have a deal?” whispered Galaga, standing so close to the taller woman that Scarlet could feel her rising body heat.  Scarlet snarled slightly, but managed to keep her master in mind when she agreed.</P>
<P>&#9;“I detest you more than anything, Galaga Starik.  But to help my master, I would love Satan himself.  I agree.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Good girl,” sang Galaga, taking Scarlet’s hand into her own.  “Now, shut the door and take off your clothes, slowly.  I want to see just how pretty you are.”</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Scarlet obeyed.</P>

<P>&#9;She had no problem with her own nakedness, but in the presence of Starik, even her stoic face showed shame.  Galaga raised her eyebrow as she watched Kagai Shazou’s most trusted accomplice shed off her clothes, first the cream-colored jacket, then the black short-sleeved shirt, then the dark-blue pants, until all that was left was a tall woman clad in dark-blue underwear, her long death-blue hair flowing freely down her body, tickling her backside.</P>
<P>&#9;“The rest,” commanded Starik, whose breathing had increased to match her arousal.  Scarlet obeyed, and couldn’t help but look away in shame as she revealed her whole self to the woman she hated.  Galaga smiled, though, and quickly took off her own clothes, revealing a surprisingly-gorgeous body, petite but powerful, as smooth and inviting as liquid chocolate.  There was evil behind the stunning beauty, though, and all the while she forced herself to look away, Scarlet silently begged for forgiveness.</P>
<P>&#9;“Now come, my pretty, and show me what you can do,” beckoned Starik.  Scarlet paled, and forced herself to walk towards Galaga, who wickedly encouraged the taller, younger woman.  Putting on a strictly professional face, Scarlet made a dark vow that she would not enjoy giving or receiving pleasure as she folded her naked arms around the body of the woman she hated, pressed her breasts into the smaller woman’s shoulders, and forced her mouth to seal itself onto hers.</P>
<P>&#9;Scarlet couldn’t help but wince as she slowly melted into Galaga’s hot embrace.  The smaller woman rubbed her mouth against Scarlet’s feverishly, lashing her tongue across the older woman’s lips and aching to rub herself against her.  Starik leaned up, brushing the tips of her breasts against Scarlet’s, forcing the younger woman to groan.  Her hands trailed down the younger woman’s backside, cupping and squeezing her bottom lustfully.  Scarlet hissed in displeasure, wincing as she received the ultimate torture.</P>
<P>&#9;She forced Galaga onto the bed, diving her tongue into the older woman’s mouth and licking the roof of her mouth, sending electric waves of mindless torture through Galaga’s body.  Galaga moaned and sucked on Scarlet’s own tongue, wrestling with it and heavily rubbing up against it as their mouths touched and their breasts crushed up against each other’s.</P>
<P>&#9;Scarlet wanted everything to come to a quick end, so even though she was hating everything about the sexual encounter, even herself, she resolved herself to pinning Galaga’s hands against the bed.  She bore her death-blue eyes into Galaga’s face, her long hair flowing onto her quasi-lover’s beautiful dark skin, and slowly began to grind her Self into Galaga, creating forbidden waves of delicious pain.  In the darkest corridors of her mind, Scarlet was actually enjoying the act of sex, but continued to remind herself that this was a hated enemy of hers, and this was nothing but business for her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;After that, the two women engaged in forbidden lust, an act of sexual maliciousness and depravity that was only enjoyed by one:  Starik, who had taken control of the taller and (surprisingly) much stronger woman.  She moaned out loud in utter ecstasy as she had her way with the tall woman, who could only look up as her enemy made love to her.  With a wicked grin, Starik jammed two of her fingers inside Scarlet’s most secret area, the one treasure she had kept to herself for the past three decades.  Scarlet instantly stiffened, and for the first time in a very long while, she showed deep emotion and protested.</P>
<P>&#9;“No, please!” she whispered.  “I beg of you, please don’t… do that.  Please don’t take my virginity, Galaga, I beg of you!  Please, please don’t!  It’s… it’s the only thing I have left of me.  Please, I’ll do anything else!”  Galaga grinned with more wickedness than even she thought possible, and realized that she had the tall woman completely under her control.  Of course, she <I>could</I> have went ahead and raped her, as she had sometimes done before to other men (<I>and</I> a few women), but there was something in the way that Scarlet desperately begged that stayed Starik’s hand.</P>
<P>&#9;“Anything?” she sang, licking her own moist fingers.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes!” hissed Scarlet desperately, and she meant it.  Galaga chuckled darkly, and leaned down to place a cold kiss on Scarlet’s lips.</P>
<P>&#9;“I want your mouth where my fingers are right now,” she hissed, slowly moving her fingers from Scarlet’s crotch to her own.  “I want you to please me there, and I’m going to please you there too.  After that, I’ll give you the information you need.”  Shakily, showing a hint of weakness for the first time in her life, Scarlet nodded her head, and crept down to fulfill Galaga’s dark desires without a sound…</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Shakily, wearing clothes that matted onto a body reeking of sweat and twisted lovemaking, Scarlet left the room of Galaga Starik and rushed towards her master’s room, her body shaken with terror and her face ghostlike and opaque.  She nearly burst into his room, panting slowly and deeply as the nightmares of the past experience flooded in her head.  The only thing that kept her from ripping her hair apart and tearing her own skull open to destroy her brain was the information she had gathered from her most hated enemy.</P>
<P>&#9;“Master… I am back,” she whispered.  Kagai, who was standing up as he watched the universe pass him by through a large viewing window, turned to look at his bodyguard.  She was a disheveled mess, certainly not the pillar of unmovable strength he had known all his life.  She was sweating, and her normally-empty face had a look of desperation and horror on it.</P>
<P>&#9;“Lady Scarlet, what has happened?” he demanded.  “You are not yourself.”</P>
<P>&#9;“It was Galaga; she forced me into submitting to her wishes in exchange for the information you wanted,” she muttered.  Kagai’s face actually lit up in surprise--he had taken his mask off once he had privacy--and he studied his bodyguard very carefully before coming to a conclusion.</P>
<P>&#9;“I see… so her perversions are deeper than I thought.  Lady Scarlet, you should be more pliable with people, especially those you detest.”</P>
<P>&#9;“But she would not help you any other way,” she replied firmly.  Kagai frowned, but not at his guardian, and summoned her to his side.</P>
<P>&#9;“That is an evil woman, but your sacrifice was not in vain.  I do not think I will have any more reason to affiliate myself with her.  What did you discover?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Everything you asked, and more,” she replied.  “What shall I say?”  He snorted and covered his nose as he drew near her.</P>
<P>&#9;“First, cleanse yourself and emerge fresh; you have a smell that is offensive, though it all belongs to that devil.  I would prefer it, lady Scarlet, if you speak into a recording so that I may go over everything at my own pace.  Will you be able to accomplish this?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Of course,” she said, composing herself at last as she bowed.  “I can perform any task my master asks me.  I shall return within half an hour, refreshed and cleaned of this… evil stench.”  With a snort that only Kagai saw, Scarlet excused herself and retreated to the bathroom.  She paused for only a moment, and turned around to give him a pleading look.  Scarlet rarely showed emotions, as did Kagai, but to each other they were comfortable with revealing their true feelings.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Master, I have served you all my life, but now I must go against my vow and ask you a favor--only one.  If you can find it within yourself, will you please never set me within distance of that wretched woman ever again?  If I ever ask you of anything again, I will bargain with blood instead of words.”</P>
<P>&#9;“No need for such drama, guardian,” he told her.  “I would sooner talk to her myself than send you into that lioness’ den.  You have performed a year’s worth of tasks for me, Scarlet; I ask of you to give me the information, then you may rest.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I am grateful,” she replied with a faint smile, “but I cannot.  Now I distrust her even more, and fear of her keeps me from being away from you.  I shall return in half an hour.”  And with that, the smile faded and so did she, leaving behind little save a trail of dark-blue hair.  Kagai watched her leave, then turned back to watch the universe again.  Silently, he vowed to avenge Scarlet by any means necessary, preferably by repaying the favor to Galaga in the most violent way possible.  Such loyalty did not need to be rewarded with such cruelty.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>&#9;<I>Galaga Starik is the leader of AUH, All Unpaid Helpers, a more polite way of addressing the slave trade.  She inherited it all from her father, and expanded it to reach the more distant and obscure corners of the galaxy.  As she lusts after you now, she once lusted after a free-spirited and noble slave that had came into her possession, and ordered him to sleep with her.  She became pregnant after several of these encounters, but two weeks after the birth of the child, the slave escaped.  His name is Lio Tornheart, and technically, the full name of their child is Lantariz Corny Tornheart Starik, though he was able to eliminate the mother’s name.</P>
<P>&#9;The Tornhearts have been on the run for about sixteen years now, and during that time, Galaga searched relentlessly for them, posting bounties everywhere.  She even promised freedom to any slave who found them.  She doesn’t care for any life save her daughter’s, because she firmly expressed to me that she would gladly kill anyone who was in her way.</P>
<P>&#9;She plans on grooming Lantariz to take her place, since the daughter of the chief slave trader would be better suited as the next leader rather than a slave.  According to recent information I discovered elsewhere, the bounty hunters Asuka Honmisei and Bloodstorm had knowledge of Tornheart’s whereabouts, but did nothing to return her to her mother.  A very recent statement made by DT member #13 says that Tornheart, Honmisei, and the cyborg have taken refuge in the Angel Resistance Foundation, where the key character known as Ichi resides.  We have also confirmed that the one known as Rockwell, who has “the map”, is also on the Foundation.</P>
<P>&#9;Master, if we could enlist the aide of #13, who has knowledge of the Foundation’s whereabouts, it’s possible we could help both Grady and Starik.  We may then be able to help ourselves, or should I say “help you”, with your crusade.  It’s worth looking into.  End transmission.</P>
</I>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“That may not be necessary,” muttered Kagai as he turned off the recording.  “Lady Scarlet, I look forward to our next meeting.  When I see you again, I will tell you that my spies report that Aisuna, the Ice Djinn that Grady has been looking for so obsessively, has finally completed her duties and is prepared to return once again to the north.  I suggest, instead of finding the map and Ichi, that we follow this goddess and do whatever it takes to free her.”</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Closing comments:  Hopefully, this will be the only descriptive sex scene I write.  It was my first, so I’m not exactly fluent.  I wanted to make it sound evil and wrong--not because of the gender of the “pairing”, but the fact that Scarlet’s hatred is well-justified.  Not all sex is good sex.  Preview of next chapter:  With her mission complete, Aisuna returns to the North Pole, with a certain tenacious Informer close by her side…</P></BODY>
