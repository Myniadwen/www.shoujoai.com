6:29 am

 

&quot;Come on, papa, pick up already,&quot; she whispered desperately. &quot;I don&#39;t 
have much time. My ride will be here soon.&quot; Her wishes were soon granted 
as she heard a relieving tone, and a groggy, hoarse voice greeting her 
with as much cheer as it could muster at this early hour.

&quot;Mmn, Nadia. Good morning...huuuah. Excuse me...whew.&quot;

&quot;I am so sorry, papa,&quot; she grinned, almost bursting with gladness. &quot;This 
was the only time I could call you. We won&#39;t be having any phones at our 
hotels and I&#39;m not allowed to take my cell phone.&quot;

&quot;All right, slow down there,&quot; he implored, grunting softly as he rubbed 
the sleepiness away. &quot;Why are you even calling this early? You have not 
been partying too hard, I hope.&quot;

&quot;Well, sometimes,&quot; she admitted sheepishly, &quot;but that&#39;s not what this is 
about. Ah...oh, darn.&quot; She glanced at her clock and noticed the lapse in 
time. &quot;Urgh, I wish I had more time to explain, papa. Gosh, I...now that 
I think about it, we have so much to catch up on. I&#39;m sorry I haven&#39;t 
been calling.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; he said warily, &quot;mother said you found a new girlfriend. She&#39;s 
not the one that&#39;s keeping you up all night, is she?&quot;

&quot;No, papa, of course not. We&#39;re still in that beginning stage. You&#39;re as 
bad as Nana sometimes in your assumptions. Oh, darn it, now I&#39;m really 
falling behind! Just listen, okay? Ow!&quot;

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Nadia winced and gnashed her teeth. She had bumped 
her knee against an end table in her haste to get packed. She started 
cursing in English since she knew her father wouldn&#39;t understand.

&quot;[Damn all! Damn freak son of bitch!] Ohh, just bumped my knee, papa. 
Big game today.&quot;

&quot;Are you all right? Wait- don&#39;t tell me you stayed up all night 
worrying, Nadia. Your mother and I have told you before- &quot;

&quot;No, that&#39;s not it. Ow! [Freaking ass-rape!] Ach...okay, I think I feel 
better. Listen, papa, I just called because I needed to hear your voice. 
We have a big game later today, and...I&#39;m sorry I have never called you 
before. I&#39;m so sorry; I&#39;ve been very busy.&quot;

&quot;With the girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;With everything,&quot; she sighed in resignation. Her knee didn&#39;t feel much 
better but now wasn&#39;t the time to worry about that. Nadia was already 
running late; she would have to make do with what she had already 
packed. Freya&#39;s Porche was in the driveway and she could hear Maria 
approaching the door (she knew it was Maria because her visitor wasn&#39;t 
nearly as graceful with her footsteps). &quot;Papa, just listen,&quot; she 
continued. &quot;I&#39;m heading over to another town to play an away game. I&#39;ll 
be there all day and so we&#39;ll be staying at a hotel- I mean the other 
players and me. I had to call you because...it would mean the world to 
me if you and mama and everyone else would come and cheer for me.&quot;

&quot;All right, dear, we&#39;ll do that. Which town is it?&quot;

&quot;The one with my other hero,&quot; she announced before hanging up. Not even 
an &quot;I love you&quot;. Nadia felt terrible and hoped she could make up for it 
later that day.

 

That is, if she could keep herself together that long.

 

In this wide world

People you&#39;re meant to meet can be seen

Beyond the window, beyond the rainbow

I think you&#39;re aware of them

Take off that restrictive weight

Let your feelings go

Now keep your ears open and wait for that time

Awaken now

Cherish the little dream you&#39;ve drawn in the vast sky

If you do, you can always become happy

It&#39;s certain, whoa whoa!

 

&quot;The Blood Bond&quot;

 

&quot;And I thought I was supposed to be the pale one,&quot; Freya sighed as she 
observed poor Nadia trying to catch her breath. She offered a small 
cooler with chilled coffee, Red Bull, juice, and chocolate milk, and 
insisted her guest indulge. &quot;Listen, Nadia,&quot; she resumed, &quot;if you&#39;re 
having any problems, you know we&#39;ll be there to help you.&quot;

&quot;I have just being in large hurry this morning,&quot; she said, taking a 
moment to catch her breath before she drank the juice. &quot;I needed to call 
papa. I wish we have been given okay for phones so I would not need to 
be so fast. Also hurt my knee a little.&quot;

&quot;Do you think you&#39;ll be able to play on it?&quot; Nadia shrugged. Normally 
she would be a bundle of energy, despite the hour, but she was always 
like this before a game. Only a few people knew of how much she dreaded 
the pressure and the anticipation that built up before playoffs: how the 
knots in her belly would bundle together and wring out her courage until 
there was almost nothing left- until she felt ready to throw up and run 
away. Once the game itself started, of course, most of that went away, 
and her mind was cleared- but it was the calm, not the storm itself, 
that Nadia feared above anything else.

&quot;Waz not big bump. Will be fine for later. Still wish I could have said 
more with papa. Have not spoken with him for very long.&quot;

&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Freya replied softly. &quot;My family doesn&#39;t exactly 
keep in touch with me on most occasions. You know, living in Germany and 
whatnot. But I&#39;ve heard they&#39;re all taking some time off to watch us 
play.&quot;

&quot;Really? How have you...uh, trick them into it?&quot;

&quot;I told them it was our biggest game so far,&quot; she chuckled faintly. 
&quot;It&#39;s the first time we&#39;re going against an undefeated team. I couldn&#39;t 
keep Ida away, of course, but Alita and Gauss are a little different. 
Um, they&#39;re my older sister and brother. Grandmutter Lutecia wouldn&#39;t be 
there, of course, but I&#39;ve resigned myself to that.&quot;

&quot;I wish the elder mistress would act her age for once and support you,&quot; 
Shiki announced from the driver&#39;s seat.

&quot;Yes, well...&quot; Freya smiled sadly as she trailed off. Nadia&#39;s curiosity 
was stoked.

&quot;You have been having problem with Nana?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Grandmutter Lutecia sort of disowned me a long time ago,&quot; Freya 
replied skittishly. &quot;She&#39;s more into Ida now. I think she hates me 
because I steal all of Ida&#39;s affections away!&quot;

&quot;Not intentionally, I&#39;m sure,&quot; Maria smirked. Freya laughed; Nadia was 
amazed. She wouldn&#39;t be able to live in a world without close contact 
with her family. She had one of those large, fun-loving Russian families 
that were very close, very proud, and very protective of each other. 
Going so long without calling her most immediate relatives was like 
depriving herself of food and water.

&quot;Maybe is good thing she is not there,&quot; she mused. &quot;My Nana would make 
lovink eyes to her.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that wouldn&#39;t do!&quot; Freya exclaimed. &quot;My Grandmutter is very 
traditional...which is probably why she doesn&#39;t want anything to do with 
me. Ah, it seems like we&#39;re here. All right, everyone, thank you for 
taking the Araya-chan express!&quot;

&quot;Please keep your hands firmly placed on the nearest woman&#39;s chest at 
all times!&quot; Maria said, demonstrating the proper way to perform this 
action. Freya shrieked and Shiki reprimanded them for acting so lewdly 
in public. Nadia was starting to wish Elisa had ridden with them as 
well.

 

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect either of you to be here,&quot; said Miss Berkeley as she 
stiffly hugged her father.

&quot;Right, well...&quot; He trailed off lazily and crossed his arms; family time 
appeared to be over now. Her mother was perched at a bench, content to 
read the paper without interacting. The three of them positioned 
themselves in a kind of loose triangle, all three points relative to 
each other but not necessarily affecting. It was as if they were only 
connected by an air-thin string- Elisa had known about this for awhile, 
ever since they told her the truth.

&quot;So,&quot; her father said after a few more minutes of quiet, &quot;have you been 
making any friends? I hear you&#39;re getting into this sport now.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, it&#39;s probably the best thing that&#39;s happened to me in a long 
while. I have actually made a few acquaintances: there&#39;s my roommate 
first, a darling young lady from Boston named Shannon. She&#39;s really the 
perfect person to live with, if you&#39;re someone like me.&quot; A bad joke, of 
course, one that even she didn&#39;t find amusing. &quot;Robin and I have been 
getting along, too, and Fausta as well. She&#39;s still as spirited as ever. 
Um...and there&#39;s this new girl at Parody, too, though we really don&#39;t 
talk much. I&#39;m, uh, especially close to a young Russian woman. We 
have...good communication.&quot;

&quot;Ah, so all that time you spent studying has been put to good use,&quot; her 
mother said, briefly looking up from her morning news.

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am.&quot; She didn&#39;t tell them about Rain, though she wanted to. The 
two of them, as polar as they were in terms of...well, practically 
everything, had at least one thing in common. Elisa had never known her 
biological parents.

&quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; she said, before resuming her news. Elisa habitually 
dusted her clothes and was content to sit in the park and take it easy 
before the big game. Once she believed her parents were uncaring, 
emotionally abusive statues, little more than moving bodies one 
conversed with that sometimes threw her their attentions. It wasn&#39;t 
until much later in her life when she resigned herself to be content 
with this, for she knew theirs was a rough marriage, made all the 
rougher by the broken hopes that were stillborn before her time. This 
was normally as loving as they became, and she was smart enough to 
understand how really fortunate she was. Alice, poor dear, and Amy, 
bless her, had no families at all.

Even so, she was filled with relief as Shannon came by at last, some 
bags of breakfast in her hands. Elisa had driven her over (in her small 
silly little Beetle) and now her roommate was repaying the debt. 
Introductions were made as Berkeley glanced at Shannon&#39;s family with 
more than a little envy. She understood by now that Mr. Threal was 
usually on the road and rarely saw his wife and daughter, and yet 
Shannon was closer to him. That did make a bit of sense, considering her 
tomboyish character: he was a trucker, heart and soul. He made it today, 
though, but only because he was passing through. He was still strong 
enough to carry her on his back, and even hauled her around for a few 
steps before attacking his breakfast.

&quot;It&#39;s too bad ya gotta stay on a diet, Shan,&quot; he said, brandishing a 
biscuit. &quot;You an&#39; I both, kid. I dunno how we&#39;re gonna keep this up. 
What&#39;s ya secret, rosy tush?&quot; He slapped his wife&#39;s bottom, causing her 
to shriek. Elisa had never seen her adopted parents playing with each 
other, not even a hint.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell ya one thing, Ahnald, it ain&#39;t cuz&#39; o&#39; sittin&#39; around in a 
truck all day. Why don&#39;t&#39;cha try a treadmill every now and then?&quot;

&quot;Or takin&#39; up sports?&quot; Shannon mumbled. She swallowed and wiped her 
mouth with her sleeve (Elisa preferred napkins).

&quot;Ha,&quot; he grunted, &quot;I don&#39;t got time.&quot;

&quot;So, how long do you think you might be staying, Mr. Threal?&quot; Elisa 
asked.

&quot;Mmm, not as long as I want,&quot; he said after giving it a moment&#39;s 
thought. &quot;Iffit were up to me, now, it&#39;d be somethin&#39; like a yeah. 
Coas&#39;, the trucka&#39;s union already got their claws in me, but I&#39;ll stay 
as long as I can. Um, if ya don&#39;t mind my sayin&#39;, Miss, uh, Berkeley- 
you&#39;re a fine lady, I think, and I was wonderin&#39; if...&quot;

&quot;Oh, daddy, honestly!! Not this again!&quot; He made a face and shrugged as 
he resumed eating. Elisa blinked.

&quot;If what, sir?&quot;

&quot;Ah, nothin&#39;,&quot; he grunted. &quot;Jussat Shannon heah needs to be moah like a 
lady now that she&#39;s growin&#39; up.&quot; She threw her muffin wrapper at him and 
he flinched. &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t say I didn&#39;t love ya, sugah pie! You&#39;re a 
saint and an example to women everywheah! I wish they was all this 
good!&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t that be something,&quot; his wife muttered.

&quot;I just wish somebody&#39;d teach her what it&#39;s like to be a lady. I&#39;m not 
sayin&#39; you should put her in dresses or make her walk with books on her 
head- just some poise and dignity. Feminine wiles and all that. I feel 
like it&#39;s my fault sometimes she&#39;s like this.&quot;

&quot;Wasn&#39;t my doing,&quot; his wife muttered again. Elisa sighed maturely.

&quot;You and I have something in common, Mr. Threal. We both love Shannon 
exactly the way she is and would not want her to change. And I know it 
is not your choice, sir, but if you would just spend a bit more time 
with her, I think you&#39;ll find she&#39;s an astounding lady in her own 
right.&quot;

&quot;I think sending her to this school was the right idea,&quot; Elisa&#39;s father 
said to her mother. &quot;She&#39;s grown quite well, and she&#39;s certainly more 
outspoken.&quot;

&quot;Yes. Oh, here comes another one, I think. Elisa, did you ask another 
one of your friends to meet us here in the park?&quot; Elisa froze solid as 
she suddenly remembered that she did. What would her parents think- or 
Shannon&#39;s, for that matter- when they saw this spectacle unfolding 
before them?

It was Nadia.

 

- Rain Howlet, Hair/eye color: dirty blonde, bluish-grey, defensive 
midfielder-

 

Because the game wouldn&#39;t start for a few more hours, the girls&#39; 
families were able to spend some time with them- some, admittedly, more 
in need of it than others. Alice didn&#39;t know whether to feel relieved or 
depressed when no one came for her; she couldn&#39;t help but feel envious 
when Nadia&#39;s family arrived and practically suffocated her. She even got 
to see Kasumi&#39;s mother and younger brother, who didn&#39;t usually attend 
her games. The family had been divorced for most of Kasumi&#39;s life and so 
it made sense that half of it would not be in attendance; Kasumi tried 
hard not to let her anger show as she gave her mother a stiff hug.

&quot;You look pretty good,&quot; Diana offered. &quot;You&#39;re starting to have a 
healthy glow on your skin, and it looks like you&#39;ve put on a little more 
weight.&quot;

&quot;My life&#39;s changed,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;I live somewhere else now.&quot;

&quot;I know, your father told me that. I never did like that ramshackle old 
place he picked out...but I guess he couldn&#39;t get any better on his 
salary.&quot;

&quot;Things are getting better for him,&quot; she replied numbly. Her father came 
by later, smiling, and Kasumi&#39;s mood lifted considerably. Even Kasumi&#39;s 
strained relationship with her mother would be better than two people 
who have cut off all ties to you; Alice could only wish things were that 
good for her. Of course, she had to count herself lucky: at least her 
father didn&#39;t harass her like Felicity&#39;s, or annoy and frustrate her 
like Terra&#39;s. Vu and Lien Tu were predictably absent, to Terra&#39;s great 
relief, but in their place was her younger sister, Mai, who could almost 
pass as a twin.

&quot;She very cute too,&quot; Nadia commented. &quot;I wish I knowing what iz like for 
brother and sister.&quot;

&quot;Overrated,&quot; Lauren grumbled. Her family was completely absent, once 
again taking custody of her helpless brother. Amy was probably the most 
miserable at all, though, since all of her close relatives had been 
killed, and she didn&#39;t know if it would be wise to attach herself to 
Felicity, since her father was bearing down on her.

&quot;You&#39;re looking well,&quot; he said curtly. &quot;School isn&#39;t too easy for you, I 
presume.&quot;

&quot;Oh no, every day is a challenge,&quot; she smirked. Samuel was a little 
surprised to see her smiling so easily; normally she just hung her head 
and listened without any reaction. Felicity&#39;s life had turned around and 
he was too focused on something insignificant to notice.

&quot;What about the team, or the coach? They haven&#39;t been holding you back, 
have they?&quot;

&quot;Not at all. I&#39;ve actually made a lot of new friends here.&quot;

&quot;Friends come and go,&quot; he replied coldly. &quot;I don&#39;t want you spending too 
much time around them. Take advantage of whatever you can and 
concentrate on your own development.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not a very nice thing to say,&quot; she muttered. Samuel suddenly 
flared up and almost struck her.

&quot;I am going to pretend I did not hear you say that, young lady, but next 
time, show some prudence and respect towards me.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; she said lamely. &quot;Father, may I change the subject for a moment, 
please? I have a request for you.&quot; He frowned and crossed his arms. Why 
was his daughter being so forward and laid-back all of a sudden? He was 
beginning to wonder that maybe, taking her to Carnegie might not have 
been such a great idea. She was losing focus and becoming frivolous.

&quot;Hmph, all right. What is it?&quot; She folded her hands, cleared her throat, 
and stood straight, wanting to sound as mature and professional as she 
could. One thing a strict upbringing affords is the ability to perform 
graciously for one&#39;s elders and superiors.

&quot;Father, I&#39;m nineteen years old, and I&#39;ll be twenty in nine months. I&#39;m 
an adult now, and I feel it&#39;s time that I make my own choices in life. I 
know that sometimes I don&#39;t always live up to your expectations, but I 
do try. What I want to ask you is...do you think it would be possible 
for me to see mother?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he stated almost immediately. &quot;You&#39;re near the end of the autumn 
season and you don&#39;t need any distractions. You&#39;ll get a Christmas card 
from her over the holidays, but spring and summer are when you need to 
focus.&quot;

&quot;Father, I don&#39;t think soccer is more important than my mother.&quot; 
Incensed, he stormed up to her, glaring eye to eye, ready to raise his 
fist. He wouldn&#39;t, of course- not with all these people around- but he 
was very close, and he knew the fear of force was worse than the force 
itself.

&quot;I asked you not to speak to me that way. You may be an adult but I am 
still your father.&quot; Felicity was frightened, to be honest, and certainly 
would&#39;ve backed down a few weeks ago. It was incorrect to say she had 
any more courage than before; she just had that much less fear.

&quot;I know, but I&#39;m not asking for a lot. If you&#39;re going to get angry and 
hit me, then go ahead. Prove whatever point you&#39;re trying to make. I 
still want to see her.&quot; If looks could kill, or at least smolder, 
Felicity would have been a puddle of goo by now. Flames were very nearly 
shooting out of Samuel&#39;s eyes, and he was shaking with rage. The fact 
that he could control his anger to an extent (and was too proud to 
resort to violence) was Felicity&#39;s saving grace.

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; he snarled quietly. &quot;But for right now, I want you to 
concentrate on this game. St. Thekla&#39;s is an easy opponent but for their 
goalie. They say she&#39;s perfect, so I expect you to rise to this 
challenge.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t you worry about that, father,&quot; she beamed. &quot;We&#39;re going to 
break that wall even if we have to do it brick by brick.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to break it,&quot; he emphasized. Felicity merely shrugged, as 
if to say, &quot;maybe&quot;. No matter what kind of a man her father was, or what 
restrictions he placed on her, he was still her father, and she wanted 
to make him proud. Just not at the expense of her other interests.

 

The strangest thing yet happened shortly before Leena arrived to check 
on everyone. Her own parents obviously couldn&#39;t make it, but she had 
seen them recently and so didn&#39;t feel quite so left out. Kathlyn&#39;s 
brother was there on one of his rare days away from work, still amazed 
at who his in-law was, and how much his older sister had progressed 
since those dark days of her youth. Lauren was hiding out with them too, 
glum despite her professed hatred of her family, and Amy soon joined 
them, feeling lonely without Felicity. She wanted to be by her side, but 
now was not the time: why, if Samuel Velur knew his daughter was a 
lesbian, violence would be the least of her concerns.

But onto the peculiarities. A middle-aged Frenchwoman strolled into the 
crowd, waved to Fleur, and took her in her arms. Fleur kissed her cheeks 
and, for a moment, almost looked like she had a heart. Her face glowed 
with love and her eyes flickered in fascination, and she even smiled. 
This was clearly Fleur&#39;s mother and the only person in the world she 
genuinely loved and cared for.

&quot;Ah, so she does have a heart after all,&quot; Fausta noticed. &quot;And here I 
thought she was a homunculus.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Fausta&#39;s parents had flown in from Italy, taking her older 
brothers with them. They were all on business but decided to stop by and 
witness this potentially monumental game. The youngest Nazario of the 
five pointed to Fleur.

&quot;That one. Normally she&#39;s something of a black widow. I guess even a 
glacier can have a warm side now and then.&quot; She made a face and rubbed 
her bad shoulder; Alonza Nazario noticed it and clucked his tongue.

&quot;You&#39;re still pushing yourself, aren&#39;t you? We have told you before it&#39;s 
that recklessness of yours that will cause you the greatest suffering.&quot;

&quot;Better to burn out than fade away,&quot; she grunted, trying to ignore the 
brief, fiery stabs of pain. Fausta knew it would go away eventually; the 
spasms weren&#39;t agonizing so much as frustrating. She never could predict 
when they would strike. &quot;Let me introduce you to Elisa...and I suppose I 
had better show you who Terra is, too.&quot; Terra heard this and tore away 
from chatting with Mai.

&quot;Uh-oh, here comes trouble,&quot; she mumbled. Fausta looked unusually 
peaceful today- and rather beautiful, admittedly- Terra was paralyzed 
momentarily as her coworker made introductions.

&quot;They don&#39;t speak good English, so if you have anything to say, make it 
simple.&quot;

The spell was soon broken. Same old Fausta.

&quot;Hello,&quot; she said, bowing slightly. &quot;I&#39;m...just her coworker. Um, and 
her teammate, too.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s humble, but very cute,&quot; Fausta translated with a smirk. &quot;Also 
very unpredictable. One minute she&#39;s a mouse, and the next, a tigress.&quot;

&quot;We really wish you could just find a nice man to settle down with,&quot; her 
mother sighed. &quot;Why do you feel the need to embarrass us with 
this...infatuation with other girls?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just who I am,&quot; she grunted as she rotated her bad shoulder. The 
pain was awful but it gave her sharp clarity. She said to Terra, 
&quot;They&#39;re very happy to meet you. They were wondering if you could marry 
one of my brothers.&quot;

&quot;You liar!&quot; she blurted, as Mai laughed out loud.

 

- Elisa Berkeley, Parents: George and Nell Berkeley (adopted), left 
midfielder/reserve-

 

Rumor had it that before she entered into her prestigious soccer career, 
Shannon Wilson was a kindhearted but slightly spoiled socialite, the 
kind of person who could look down her nose at most of the world and 
find solace only in the company of people like Valencia or Freya. She 
had had little athletic skill or interest, and viewed sports with the 
same stiff indifference the majority of her fortunate brethren did. More 
interestingly, though, she was among the last students of the ill-fated 
Canaan Academy, supposedly a woman of exceptional talents, and had only 
recently been transferred to St. Thekla&#39;s. Videos of her past 
performances were widely available for those who disbelieved the claims.

&quot;Incredible,&quot; Randy Beckett whistled as he watched one. As always, Freya 
was prepared, and had brought a laptop so that everyone could watch and 
take some last-minute pointers. St. Thekla&#39;s seemed like your everyday 
mediocre team, and they certainly played unexceptionally, but Wilson was 
a miracle. No matter how fast the ball came at her, or at what angle, 
she always managed to catch it dead on. Usually she moved to a certain 
spot well before the ball came and simply waited, almost as if she could 
read into the future, and tell exactly where it would go. She caught a 
total of fifteen balls in one video and eight in the next.

&quot;Not just incredible,&quot; he muttered- &quot;magnificent! So this is what you&#39;re 
going up against. Does your coach have a strategy?&quot;

&quot;If she does, she hasn&#39;t shared it with us yet,&quot; Kasumi replied emptily. 
Freya ran a third video while the Becketts moved away to think about 
what they had seen. &quot;You know, dad,&quot; Kasumi said, &quot;I was actually 
worried a little about this game, but my mind&#39;s just not on it. I dunno, 
maybe I feel like if I think about it too much, I&#39;ll just worry myself 
to death.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s a good way to look at things. A clear mind ensures greater 
victory, I always say.&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. I&#39;ve actually been thinking about you and mom.&quot;

&quot;Getting back together?&quot; he chuckled. &quot;No, that won&#39;t work out. We had a 
great thing while it lasted but I just can&#39;t provide for her anymore.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; she said, although deep in her heart she 
wanted it quite badly. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been thinking about mom, and about 
what I...put in that letter.&quot;

&quot;Which one?&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; she mumbled. &quot;About my...thing. You haven&#39;t mentioned it at 
all.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, princess,&quot; he 
chuckled. &quot;You&#39;re gonna have to be more specific than that.&quot;

&quot;That...thing in the letter,&quot; she emphasized. This was getting her 
nowhere. Was her father teasing her, playing dumb, or did he honestly 
not know? Kasumi knew it had to come out in the open, but she was afraid 
of saying it. &quot;You know,&quot; she sighed. &quot;That thing about me being...&quot; Her 
father still looked confused, so she decided to just come out and say 
it. &quot;Uh...gay and stuff. Didn&#39;t you get that?&quot;

&quot;I got it. So? What about it?&quot;

&quot;What do you think?&quot; she murmured. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m just asking because...I 
think I might be a little afraid. That&#39;s part of the reason mom left.&quot;

&quot;No, honey,&quot; he said, laying a gentle hand on her shoulder. &quot;We got 
divorced for many reasons, but your mother&#39;s sexuality had nothing to do 
with it. Trust me.&quot;

&quot;Then what for?&quot; she grunted, feeling angry and abandoned all of a 
sudden.

&quot;Well, your brother Charlie set us back with his hospital bills, 
remember, and we were forced to move to a rough neighborhood. Your 
mother and I spent a lot of restless nights trying to come up with a way 
to keep the ship afloat, but...when I got fired from the CIA, it was 
almost impossible. We knew we couldn&#39;t keep our marriage together under 
those circumstances, so we separated.&quot;

&quot;You mean you divorced.&quot; Randy bit down on his lip.

&quot;Yeah. And I know that hurt you, but...it was the only thing we could&#39;ve 
done at the time. Listen, Kasumi, no matter what you might think, it 
wasn&#39;t because your mother came out about something or that she left 
you.&quot;

&quot;So, what, should I be mad at Charlie now?&quot; Randy sighed, feeling 
defeated. Kasumi knew she had crossed a line and hastily apologized; she 
was just feeling emotional.

&quot;No, don&#39;t worry about it. You have every right to be angry. We old 
people can be selfish sometimes. And I really don&#39;t have anything wrong 
with you being gay, Kasumi. All I care about is you getting a better 
life than we did.&quot; Kasumi offered a watery smile as they hugged; she 
kissed him on the cheek and wiped her eyes.

&quot;Thanks, dad. That&#39;s a real load off my mind. If that&#39;s your answer, 
maybe I should introduce you to Valencia.&quot;

 

&quot;Anyway, Felix sends his love, and that&#39;s better than nothing, I 
suppose. So which one is Kasumi?&quot; Marina Durante stood on her toes and 
peered through the crowd. Knowing her sister, her new love interest 
would be tall, dark, gorgeous, energetic, seductive, and fun. Kasumi was 
a Japanese name, so logic entailed she would be of that region. She saw 
two Asian girls and pointed to the tallest one, a gloomy and quiet woman 
dressed like she came from the bargain bin. &quot;Ugh, please don&#39;t tell me 
that&#39;s her.&quot;

&quot;No, stupid, that&#39;s Amy. And don&#39;t judge her by what she&#39;s wearing. 
She&#39;s a good person.&quot;

&quot;All right. What about that short girl over there?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Terra. Come on, you know me.&quot;

&quot;Right, sorry. What about...her, over there?&quot;

&quot;Who, Fausta?&quot; Valencia paused for a moment as she considered something 
that had been in her mind for awhile. She definitely liked Kasumi, but 
Fausta was really closer to her type. Not only did she match all the 
physical and emotional traits Valencia sought out, but she was very 
fashion-conscience and intelligent as well. The two of them only spoke 
on occasion, and yet Valencia felt more comfortable around her than 
anyone else (except for Marina, obviously). Of course, she wasn&#39;t so 
shallow as to leave one woman for another, but...maybe Kasumi could be 
talked into having a threesome. Eventually.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; she grinned, &quot;but that&#39;s a good guess. Kasumi&#39;s the one over 
there.&quot;

&quot;Her?&quot; Marina winced as she saw the silver streak. &quot;She&#39;s not Japanese! 
She&#39;s not even Asian.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say she was, Moron-a. But yeah, that&#39;s her. She&#39;s a little shy 
sometimes, but she&#39;s got this really sexy smile- and you should see her 
abs!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that&#39;s all you look at while you shower together,&quot; Marina 
smirked.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Valencia announced proudly, &quot;she does have very beautiful 
fingers, and her bare feet are really cute.&quot;

She rolled her eyes. &quot;Ass. Let me see her. Santa Maria, if mama and papa 
knew you had a girlfriend, they&#39;d be speechless, and not in a good way. 
You should be so lucky to have me as a confidante.&quot;

&quot;I know, especially since I never told them about how you aren&#39;t a 
virgin!&quot; The Durante sisters walked up to Kasumi as she was chatting 
with her father and politely interrupted her. Nadia also made 
introductions for her parents&#39; sake (they loved Elisa as much as 
Svetlana had), but was pulled aside for a moment by Felicity, of all 
people.

&quot;Come with me for a second,&quot; she asked. &quot;I have to prove to my father 
I&#39;m actually making friends. He doesn&#39;t believe me.&quot; Nadia blushed and 
felt her stomach flip a little as she followed her.

 

Not a teammate. Not a coworker. A friend.

Whatever anxiety she had been struggling with earlier was long gone by 
now.

 

Good thing, too: the fated hour was soon upon them. Farewells were 
understandably brief prior to battle.
