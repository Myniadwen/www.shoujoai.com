<a href="../original/angelgift-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Allison blew out a little sigh of relief, looking around the cozy 
little book store that she had inherited from her father. It was 
quiet, peaceful, and the exact opposite of what her life had been like 
for the past few days. She cut open the box of books carefully, and 
knelt down to line the shelves with new novels, humming to herself 
happily.

&quot;You&#39;re pretty cheerful this morning,&quot; Kat leaned on the shelving unit 
and smiled at her, &quot;did you finally get lucky?&quot; The brown haired woman 
pushed her long hair back, looking down at the crouching Allison 
impishly.

&quot;I did not,&quot; Allison protested, but she blushed tellingly.

&quot;Oh ho!&quot; Kat grinned. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked Allison eagerly.

&quot;Nothing happened,&quot; Allison said forcefully.

&quot;Somehow, I doubt that,&quot; Kat chuckled.

The chime connected to the front door rang out, and Allison got up, 
carefully dusting off her knees. &#39;Saved by the bell,&#39; she thought with 
a sigh. Kat was a good friend, but she was a flirt who had never quite 
accepted Allison&#39;s protests that she was straight.

&quot;Hello,&quot; Allison called out as she carefully made her way to the front 
of the cluttered store, &quot;how can I help you?&quot;

&quot;I missed you!&quot; Jenna cried out, hitting Allison with a flying hug. 
She and Allison both fell to the ground in a tangle of limbs.

Kat heard the loud thump and came around the shelves as fast as she 
could manage, only to skid to a stop. A smirk spread across her face 
as she looked at the busty dark haired woman laying on top of the 
boyish Allison. &quot;Friend of yours, boss?&quot; Kat chuckled.

Allison was bright red, &quot;Uhm, yeah. Jenna, meet Kat.&quot;

Still laying on top of Allison, Jenna beamed up at Kat as she asked 
her, &quot;So are you a friend of my Allison?&quot;

&quot;Your Allison?&quot; Kat chuckled.

Jenna&#39;s eyes just glowed with happiness, &quot;We&#39;re engaged.&quot;

Allison wiggled a bit, trying to get out from under Jenna. &quot;Could you 
let me up, please?&quot; she finally asked plaintively.

&quot;Why? She certainly looks comfortable,&quot; Kat smirked. The door chime 
rang again, and Kat decided to leave the two love birds alone.

The two women looked like they had come into the store together, but 
were pointedly ignoring each other now. The blonde was tall and 
athletic, her figure quite visible in her skin tight black leather 
suit. The redhead looked about nervously, what almost looked like a 
tail lashing about her legs, her maid&#39;s uniform crisp and neat.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Kat waved, &quot;is there something I can help you with?&quot;

The blonde had a pained expression on her face as she asked, &quot;Have you 
seen a dark haired, rather good looking...&quot;

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; the redhead corrected her pointedly.

&quot;All right,&quot; the blonde sighed, &quot;dark haired and beautiful woman 
around here?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s in the back shelves with Allison,&quot; Kat smirked.

&quot;They&#39;ve barely been apart an hour,&quot; the blonde sighed, &quot;I wonder 
what&#39;ll happen after they spend a whole day apart?&quot; She offered her 
hand, &quot;Sharin.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Kat, it&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; Kat smiled.

Sharin gestured to the redhead, and Kat was surprised to see that she 
really did have a tail. Not to mention the cute little cat-ears on her 
head. &quot;The redhead who&#39;s pointedly ignoring me is Milly,&quot; she said.

&quot;I don&#39;t know who could have said that,&quot; Milly kept her back to the 
scowling Sharin. She did smile at Kat, &quot;It&#39;s nice to meet you.&quot;

Kat stepped forward, and gently scratched the cat girl under the chin. 
She began to purr softly, batting at the air with her curled hands. 
&quot;That&#39;s so cute,&quot; Kat laughed.

&quot;No, she&#39;s not,&quot; Sharin remembered seeing Milly&#39;s claws all too well.

Allison came out of the back blushing furiously, Jenna&#39;s arms still 
firmly wrapped around her neck. &quot;Sorry about this,&quot; she said 
sheepishly to Kat.

&quot;No problem,&quot; Kat grinned, continuing to scratch Milly. Allison looked 
at the two of them and sweatdropped. Again.

Sharin rolled her eyes, &quot;I tried to keep them out of here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s only right for engaged couples to be together,&quot; Jenna protested 
before smiling sweetly at Allison, &quot;right, darling?&quot;

Allison felt Jenna&#39;s body pressed up close to hers and felt her mind 
just shut down. &quot;Right,&quot; she blushed.

&quot;You are so whipped,&quot; Kat snickered quietly. Sharin chukled softly at 
that, and they exchanged a grin.

Milly pouted a bit once the petting stopped, then she remembered 
something. &quot;Mistress, don&#39;t get ahead of me again,&quot; she scolded Jenna.

Jenna&#39;s arms tightened around Allison as she protested cutely, &quot;But I 
was so eager to see her again!&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t breathe...&quot; Allison managed to get out.

Far above the world, the slim black ship dropped out of a warp in the 
fabric of space and settled right into a perfect orbit. Then it ran 
right into a satelite!

&quot;What was that doing there?&quot; the blue haired girl wailed, scrambling 
about the control room pulling on various controls while sobbing 
madly.

&quot;Get a hold of yourself,&quot; the metalic young woman said calmly, sitting 
in the other seat and operating her set of controls.

&quot;We&#39;re gonna die,&quot; the blue haired girl weeped.

&quot;I&#39;ve got us in a controlled descent,&quot; the robot said patiently, &quot;but 
we&#39;re going to splash down in that lake.&quot;

&quot;Splash down means crash,&quot; she whimpered, curling up into a little 
ball with her blue hair standing on end.

The robot girl sighed softly and concentrated on getting them down in 
one piece..

Back in the book store, Sharin&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;I feel a 
disturbance,&quot; she said eerily, &quot;I better go check it out.&quot;

Whack! Milly hit her on the back of the head. &quot;We&#39;re playing cards to 
determine who buys everyone lunch,&quot; the cat girl frowned, &quot;and the way 
you&#39;re playing, I bet you&#39;re buying!&quot;

A scowling Sharin gently rubbed the bump on the back of her head and 
put her focus back on winning the game.

&quot;Interesting friends you&#39;ve got,&quot; Kat grinned.

Allison just sighed.
