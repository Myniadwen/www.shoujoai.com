<a href="../original/lingering-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>That night felt like the longest ever. I am not sure how long Beth was 
out like that, but the minutes felt like hours as I watched over that 
child. I knew in the back of my mind I should probably call the police, 
but I did not want to get Beth in trouble. She still lived with her 
parents and explaining why she passed out at a gay bar would be a lot 
more then she needed in her life at this moment in time. Sure she was 
only four years my younger, but at that time she felt much more fragile 
and young then ever before. I occasionally whispered into the girl&#39;s ear 
to assure her that I was still there and to remind her that she was 
safe, more then anything else I told her that she was still needed in 
this world and to not give up. The very thought of Beth dying in my arms 
shook me up something else. I felt so lost at that moment and wished 
that I knew what to do to help the girl. 

Liz came down the stairs at that moment with a plate of food in one hand 
and our coats in the other. She lay the coats upon the back of a sofa 
chair in front of me and set the food down on the coffee table, &quot;Thanks 
Liz, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m very hungry right now.&quot; I remarked 
dismally. 

Liz gave me a stern look, &quot;You had better eat or you will have me to 
answer too.&quot; She commanded sternly. 

&quot;Alright, Alright.&quot; I held my hands up in defence, then glanced down at 
the sleeping girl, &quot;But I&#39;m sort of trapped at the moment.&quot; I gestured 
to Beth. 

Liz rolled her eyes and rounded the table, &quot;You will use any excuse to 
get out of things.&quot; She remarked disappointedly. 

&quot;That is far from the truth.&quot; I protested, &quot;I am very serious when it 
comes to my work.&quot; 

Liz carefully lifted Beth&#39;s head off my lap, &quot;I know, but I also 
remember finding someone dead asleep in her office one day due to 
spending so much time working and less time eating.&quot; She reminded me in 
a quiet annoyed tone, &quot;If I had not happened by then you probably would 
have starved.&quot; 

I slipped out from under Beth and gave Liz a foolish smile which rubbing 
the back of my neck, &quot;It is not my fault. People need me and I want to 
help them.&quot; I defended, which was true. I was swamped with unsolved 
cases since my sister&#39;s little girl had gone missing. I was determined 
to find any clue as to where my niece could have disappeared too. I kept 
having this feeling that I was getting closer, but she kept slipping 
through my fingers. It felt as if I was not seeing something that was 
right in front of my eyes and it was upsetting. Missing children cases 
always effected me the most out of all my case load. I tended to steer 
clear of them as best I could, but when my little sister showed up at my 
doorstep I could hardly refuse. 

There was something really strange about this case that was disturbing 
me. One moment little Brittany was in her bedroom, fast asleep and the 
next she was gone. The police found no sign of anyone entering or 
leaving the room and deemed the case as yet another runaway. The fact is 
she could not have gotten out of the room. My sister had been locking 
the door since it was discovered that the girl sleepwalked, just like 
myself. There was no way to open that door from the inside and the drop 
from her window was above the rose garden. If she had jumped there would 
have been signs of the fact, it was as if she just vanished into the 
night. Since then I&#39;ve been rather obsessed with anything related to 
sleepwalking, missing children and even child suicide. I was sure there 
was some connection and had been concentrating all my mental strength on 
figuring out what was happening in this bloody pit of a town. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to snap at you.&quot; Liz sincerely apologized, I could hear the 
strain on her voice. I could tell that all of this was really effecting 
Liz and I was starting to wonder if I should have just taken Beth back 
to my apartment instead of bringing her in here. Then again what would I 
have done at my place? At least here I have my family to help us cope 
with all of this. 

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; I moaned as I sat up and stared down at the food. My 
stomach seemed to be asleep and even the sight of the burger did not 
seem to awaken it. Actually it was making me feel a tad bit sick, but I 
would force myself to eat a bit if it made Liz feel better. She really 
was like my sister more then my own flesh and blood. Ever since we met 
all those years ago we hit it off pretty well. At first I flirted with 
her and thought that maybe we had a chance together and then she got a 
girlfriend and I started to back off, but we stayed close all the same. 
We would do the usual friend things, go to movies, have lunch together 
and the like. Over time our bond had grown stronger and she seemed to 
understand me better then anyone else. I picked up the burger and took a 
bite. 

Liz stroked the back of my head and patted my back, &quot;That is a good boi. 
Now eat up.&quot; She ordered with a giggle and started back to the bar when 
she suddenly stopped and pulled something out of the pocket of her 
shirt, &quot;Oh, I almost forgot to give you this. It fell out of Beth&#39;s coat 
pocket and I thought you might know what it is.&quot; She explained as she 
handed me a tiny blue bottle with a white cap and label wrapped around 
it. 

I took the bottle and looked it over, &quot;Medication?&quot; I asked no one in 
particular. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Liz leaned in closer to me, I could feel her breath upon my 
cheek as she pointed at the label, &quot;I noticed that she got them a week 
ago. I&#39;ve never heard to the brand before so I thought you would know.&quot; 

I searched the label til I found the contains and blinked at the word 
before me, &quot;Somnambulom?&quot; I read aloud, &quot;I&#39;ve never heard of anything 
like this before.&quot; 

&quot;So you don&#39;t know what they are?&quot; Liz inquired worriedly, &quot;Why would 
she be taking meds? Is there something wrong with her?&quot; 

I shook my head, &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I thought for a moment as I turned the 
drug&#39;s name over in my mind, &quot;It makes me think of Somnambulism, which 
is another word for Sleep Walking&quot; I explained, slightly mesmerized by 
my own strange knowledge of unusual facts. 

&quot;I never heard of that before.&quot; Liz stated perplexedly, &quot;How did you 
know something like that?&quot; 

I shrugged, &quot;I studied a lot of crazy stuff while in school.&quot; I remarked 
distantly, my mind a flutter with thoughts, &quot;I was a troubled sleeper 
and was known to have extreme night terrors. I read everything I could 
on dreams and a lot of it fascinated me. There are things about the 
human mind that you would not believe.&quot; And things that I would never 
repeat out loud for fear of what everyone would think. I discovered 
writing somewhere about a world that existed beyond the edge of the 
human mind. A place that only a few know about and even fewer could 
enter. I glanced over at Beth and the image I&#39;d seen before appeared in 
my mind again. I turned back to the pills and shook my head. My mind was 
just playing tricks on me from working too many late nights. There was 
no way that world existed. The doctors told me it was all in my head and 
that I&#39;d dreamed everything up, including the book. I had shoved all 
those thoughts from my mind many years ago so why were they appearing in 
my mind now. 

Liz lightly place her hand upon mine. I did not notice until then that I 
had been shaking and Liz&#39;s touch snapped my mind out of it 
reminiscences, &quot;Brenda? are you alright?&quot; Liz inquired gently, I glanced 
up to see a great amount of worry in those dark brown eyes and I smiled 
up at her. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; I stated, then placed the pills down upon the table, 
&quot;Just lost in my thoughts was all. I&#39;ve been rather busy at work 
lately.&quot; I explained, hoping that would satisfy the woman&#39;s worries. 

Liz gave me a sceptical look, but stood up straight, &quot;Alright then.&quot; She 
said, I could tell she did not believe me entirely, but she was willing 
to let it go, for now. I suspect I will receive a couple of surprise 
visits from her at my office over the next week or so. It was her way to 
keep an eye on me and to some extent I was grateful that someone out 
there worried about me. I watched as she reluctantly went back to the 
bar, but kept one eye on me the entire way.   

I turned back to my food and my eyes dropped to the pill bottle again. 
What could Beth been taking and was it the cause for her current 
condition? I really needed to know. 

I leaned back in the chair and ran a hand through my curly bangs as I 
stared up at the ceiling. My mind drifted back to the image I saw before 
Beth panicked. What was that all about? There had to be a reason for my 
vision to be so strong. I turned around in the chair and found my coat 
pocket. I pulled out a small black note book and pen from the pocket and 
opened it. I tended to keep a note book with myself since I was in the 
hospital to help me sort my thought. I quickly jotted down what I&#39;d see 
along with the name of the medication in hopes that someday it will 
become of use to me, then I set the pad back down and returned to eating 
my burger.
