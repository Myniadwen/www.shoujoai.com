<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>      &quot;Alright,&quot; Josh said, helping Isaka off the snake. &quot;Make sure you head back to Erin.&quot; 
Without a sound, the golem dissolved into the floor, presumably to head back to his master.

      &quot;I will start,&quot; Sakura murmured, approaching the door. It led to a vast hallway filled 
with darkness and fiends... She concentrated her holy power and began to work on unlocking 
it. As she was busy, Josh took the time to talk to Isaka.

      &quot;You&#39;re really a remarkable demon.&quot;

      She perked up at that. &quot;Wh...what? What are you talking about?&quot;

      &quot;Under ordinary circumstance, a human that gives up her body to a demon should become 
some kind of evil being,&quot; he said, watching the angel. &quot;But you not only resisted the urge - 
you retained your humanity at the same time.&quot;

      &quot;I didn&#39;t really think it was that special, or anything. I&#39;ve done a lot of bad 
things,&quot; Isaka said, thinking back to Tsuru.

      &quot;Yeah, but they could have been worse. This is actually why you&#39;re the one going in 
here,&quot; Josh said with a sigh. &quot;The rest of us wouldn&#39;t be able to deal with all the dark 
energy, let alone fight. Since you have such a strong will, then you should be perfectly 
fine.&quot; 

      Isaka gave him a wide eyed stare. &quot;If it&#39;s so dangerous, how did Hoshi, Tsuru and 
Krystal-&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru absorbed a good portion of Krystal&#39;s power so I&#39;m sure she erected some kind of 
barrier or protection.&quot; Josh paused, as if thinking of something. &quot;By the way, your demonic 
power will increase ten fold when you get there. Just be careful that no spirits devour 
you.&quot; 
 She rolled her eyes as the young man went over to help Sakura unseal the door. &quot;Of course I 
won&#39;t... Krystal would kill me.&quot; Speaking of which... was she alright? 

***** 

      &quot;Ready to give up?&quot;

      Krystal shook her head as she straightened up. She wasn&#39;t getting bashed around 
anymore, but Hoshi was still playing with her. It was taking all of Krystal&#39;s energy to keep 
her weapon sharp with holy energy that she couldn&#39;t even fathom a way to win. Hoshi had the 
upper hand with a holy sword, enough power and greater fighting technique.

      Maybe she could stall and hope for the best...? But Krystal knew that eventually Tsuru 
would come to get her, so she had to win.

      &quot;Could you please... please tell me why you&#39;re doing this?&quot; She asked, catching Hoshi 
off guard.

      &quot;Haven&#39;t we been over this before? I follow my master&#39;s orders,&quot; she said, pointing 
her sword at Krystal. &quot;You should do the same.&quot;

      &quot;Does that mean you have to molest your sisters?&quot; Hoshi shut her mouth and her jaw 
tightened. She said nothing, but charged at Krystal, mercilessly swinging her sword.

      Krystal barely blocked in time, getting shoved away by the force of her swing. &quot;How 
dare you question me?&quot; The blonde had to duck to avoid getting hit by Hoshi&#39;s sheath.

      Krystal quickly backed away, realizing that this could be her chance. Hoshi was 
getting aggressive, but sloppy - plus, she knew Hoshi couldn&#39;t fatally harm her. &quot;It doesn&#39;t 
make sense,&quot; Krystal continued. &quot;You&#39;re a human and an exorcist, but you chose this kind of 
life?&quot;

      She could only watch as energy crackled around Hoshi... dark energy. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
chose...&quot; the silver haired woman whispered, &quot;I didn&#39;t chose!&quot;

      Krystal rolled to the side to avoid the strike. &quot;I had to do it, but someone like you 
couldn&#39;t understand. I made a promise to protect them, I promised,&quot; Hoshi said, swinging at 
Krystal. &quot;I promised!&quot; 

***** 

      It had started in the morning, with people rushing around, kneeling down, paying their 
respects. Hoshi only sat next to her dying mother, watching as the people left - doctors, 
friends, clients. She had long shuffled Tsuki outside to play with Hina to shield them from 
the truth. They were only three and seven after all...

      The 14 year old looked down upon her sleeping mother, too young to die. It had been a 
demon&#39;s poison that was killing her - something untreatable and too potent for her to 
survive. Hoshi swallowed uncomfortably, listening to the laughs coming from her sisters 
outside.

      She knew that Tsuki understood what was going on, in some way, but it was better that 
they didn&#39;t. Their mother and their father had been great exorcists... her father died 
before their mother even realized she was pregnant with Hina. Now her mother would be gone 
just as Hoshi was beginning her journey towards being a woman.

      Hoshi hadn&#39;t realized she was crying until her mother spoke. &quot;Don&#39;t be sad.&quot; The 
silver haired girl couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;I saved many people, so don&#39;t be sad, Hoshi. You need 
to be happy for your sisters.&quot; Her mother gave her a strained smile. &quot;Hoshi... be a guiding 
light and always protect them from harm. Please.&quot;

      &quot;I promise,&quot; Hoshi whispered, holding her hand. &quot;I will take care of them.&quot;

      Her mother drifted back off to sleep and never woke up.

      It was then that they were taken in by the kind old monk - the man that started their 
training. Hoshi started training first, then Tsuki had to be trained to keep her powers 
under control. Finally, Hina trained alongside them, in the art of weaponry, rather than 
that of spiritual arts. They trained for years, until at the age of 19, 12 and 8; they left 
to the west, to journey through countries different than their own.

      That had been the start of Hoshi&#39;s downfall, though she didn&#39;t realize it until later. 
They traveled across the land, picking up new languages, techniques, wisdom. Hoshi didn&#39;t 
understand anything was wrong with her and sisters until the night they were camping in the 
desert plains. They were traveling through the harsh sands to reach Europe, but...

      Hoshi was staring up at the stars, her sisters nestled against her in the cold night. 
It was comforting that they were always together... Hina let out a small sigh as Hoshi 
wrapped an arm around her. But it was Tsuki that attracted her attention that night. Her 
sister&#39;s hand that was originally against her shoulder had drifted down, occasionally 
flitting over Hoshi&#39;s left breast.

      It happened again and she let out a breath. It... felt nice, even though it was 
irritating at the same time. Hoshi wondered if her robes were too thin, but concentrated on 
the constellations. That wasn&#39;t the only problem - Tsuki was growing older. Even now, Hoshi 
could feel her soft breasts up against her sides. The silver haired woman began to muse on 
her problem as she couldn&#39;t sleep in the current situation.

      Her problem continued to follow her, no matter how many demons she killed or places 
she purified. It was like the stars in the sky, always all around her. Whether it was 
Tsuki&#39;s developing body or Hina&#39;s sweet voice, there existed a problem. It came to fruition 
in Europe, in a way she hoped it wouldn&#39;t. Hina was growing up too, by this point. 16 and 
12... the 23 year old couldn&#39;t fathom how the time had passed.

      It was all the fault of the lake, the beautiful lake, reflecting the sky like a 
perfect mirror. Or maybe it was the summer night? It had been too hot and her sisters needed 
to cool down. There was no one else around, except for them. Hina and Tsuki had removed 
their clothes without a thought that their own sister was the wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing, 
watching the lambs frolic.

      &quot;Hoshi, the water&#39;s really nice,&quot; Tsuki said, her head bobbing as she swam in the 
water. Hina nodded, standing in a shallower portion.

      &quot;Come on,&quot; she beckoned. &quot;Don&#39;t be such a spoil sport!&quot;

      A flimsy smile found its way on her face as she shakily removed her robes and joined 
her sisters. She allowed that part of her - the one that whispered an easy solution at night 
- to take over. She playfully grabbed at them, splashed them, and pretended that it was all 
good fun. She indulged in their nudity, secretly relishing something she shouldn&#39;t view in 
such an impure way. When it became too dark, they left the lake, shivering.

      They dried themselves off and redressed, planning to sleep by the shore side. Tsuki 
left to go get some firewood as Hoshi sat down, guilt racking her frame. After taking 
advantage of their moment in the lake, she felt the repercussions of her actions. How much 
longer could she go on like this...? She should have married already and she could only 
dread the day her sisters started to become interested in men.

      She sheltered them away so much, making them wear hoods and scarves to cover their 
heads and mouths. She did the same, not wanting anyone to see their beauty. Hoshi felt panic 
as well. What would she do if her sisters left...? Would it be better that way? But then... 
Hoshi looked at the surface of the lake. Who would she... who would she be able to stare at 
without them knowing?

      &quot;Big sister?&quot; Hoshi was jolted out of her thoughts by Hina. The blonde girl had been 
sitting next to her the whole time. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

      Hoshi gave her a fake smile that she hoped was reassuring. &quot;Nothing. I&#39;m just 
thinking.&quot;

      Hina frowned. &quot;If something&#39;s wrong... you know me and Tsuki would do anything to help 
you. Just ask and we&#39;ll do it.&quot;

      The smile of Hoshi&#39;s face faltered as the whisper of the voice became louder. It would 
be simple, wouldn&#39;t it? She sheltered her sisters from knowing about the depravities of 
humanity, including a fascination with bodies and sex. They didn&#39;t know a thing about those 
- something Hoshi had seen during her travels.

      It would be so easy to convince them that it was a sisterly thing to do - to make each 
other feel better. It would be no different than looking at each other when naked, or 
bathing together. Just more touching... so much more touching. And all Hoshi had to do was 
ask. They trusted her and she knew she could get them to take care of this growing 
problem...

      Then she could touch them as much as she wanted. The thoughts swirling in her head 
came to an abrupt halt as Tsuki set down the firewood. The brunette noticed the silence 
between the sisters and asked, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

      Hina motioned over to her big sister. &quot;There&#39;s something bothering her.&quot;

      Tsuki gave Hoshi a concerned look. &quot;Is there something you need help with?&quot; Hoshi 
realized then that she needed so much help, but... the sweet faces of her sisters were so 
trusting... so innocent. Hoshi swallowed and shook her head.

      &quot;I just need some rest.&quot; With that, Hoshi found herself staring up at the expanse sky, 
the soft bodies of her sisters up against her. It was unbearable. After some time, she 
carefully extracted herself from their holds and walked into the forest. She finally found 
an empty meadow, devoid of all life, except for the plants that grew there.

      With a deep breath, Hoshi laid down her blanket and then lied down herself, staring up 
at the night sky. She had identified the part of her body that would always ache, so 
maybe... maybe...?

      Hoshi shut her eyes and let a nice little fantasy play out in her head as she tried to 
ease the desire herself. 

***** 

      That had been the only weakness in her heart, the only thing that was her downfall. 
Hoshi swung again, but this time, breaking through the energy around Krystal&#39;s weapon. The 
wood began to crack as the blonde tried to back away.

      Hoshi&#39;s sword was now gleaming with dark energy, but... Krystal could tell that the 
power wasn&#39;t coming from inside Hoshi herself, but rather a point on her body. &quot;How can you 
use dark energy if you are an exorcist?&quot;

      &quot;Once an exorcist,&quot; Hoshi whispered. &quot;I was once an exorcist - my sisters and I were 
the best around.&quot;

      That didn&#39;t answer Krystal&#39;s question, but she needed to stall. Her energy was nearly 
depleted and she wasn&#39;t sure how much longer she could survive on adrenaline alone. She 
tried to find some type of reserves deep inside, but until then...

      &quot;Why can&#39;t you go back to the way you were?&quot;

      Hoshi gave her a blank stare. &quot;The way I was...?&quot; She started to laugh as though it 
was the silliest thing in the world. &quot;You just don&#39;t understand thing. I used to be... I 
used to be just like you. Perfect - a model exorcist with beauty and great morals. But life 
isn&#39;t like that... nothing&#39;s like that!&quot;

      Krystal ran off to the side to avoid another swing, hearing more laughter behind her. 
&quot;Look at you - running around and ruffling your feathers like a trapped bird. What&#39;s the 
point, Krystal?&quot;

      Hoshi approached her slowly, thinking back on those words. He was the first one to 
tell her that things in the world weren&#39;t black and white - there were the gray areas and no 
matter how hard she tried... Hoshi would never be able to stay in the white area.
