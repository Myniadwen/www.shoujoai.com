<h1>Rival Rage 1.5: Planning the Predictable Saga (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/gekkaja.html">Gekkaja</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/rivrage15-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m a scion?  Do you mean like a descendent of Jesus?&quot;  Karen asked.
 
&quot;Yes, exactly.&quot;  The Angel responded.  &quot;You are the closest blood 
relative of his still alive.  Making you the most fitting candidate 
for this mission.&quot;

&quot;Wait, wait.  First of all, what&#39;s your name?&quot;

&quot;The name is &#39;Grau&#39; miss madam.&quot;  The Angel said as he bowed forward.

&quot;Ok Grau,&quot;  Karen continued.  &quot;First of all, how can I be a Scion when 
I&#39;m half Korean and half Japanese?  Second of all, what is this 
mission you keep talking about?  Last and more personally, are the 
christens right?  What I mean is, are any of the religions correct?&quot;

Grau smiled; as he knew she would ask these questions, but the last 
one was not the same one most of the living asked.  &quot;To tell you the 
truth, this form I am in now isn&#39;t my real form.  I just appeared 
before you in this form because this is what humans usually associate 
the image of an angel with.  All manners of religion and superstitions 
on Earth usually have a little truth to them, but are mostly false.  
The two truths from the Catholics are Lucifer and Jesus.

&quot;Jesus wasn&#39;t exactly the Son of God as he claimed.  That&#39;s a very 
difficult and long story and all you need to know about him is your 
related and he was the quickest to ever ascend on Earth.

&quot;On the topic of Lucifer I will also keep short.  Lucifer was the 
personal overseer of Earth when he fell.  For years he had been 
planning an overthrow of my realm or &#39;Heaven&#39; as you would call it.  
Lucifer had plans for Earth that was part of his final preparations 
for his rebellion.  We had thought we could keep him from his plans by 
replacing him from his position over Earth with some one else.  Maybe 
then Lucifer would just back down and rethink his actions.  This of 
course didn&#39;t happen.  He immediately put up a fight, but we easily 
overpowered him and he was killed.&quot;

&quot;Killed?&quot;  Karen asked in confusion.  She thought Lucifer had simply 
been thrown out of Heaven.

&quot;Yes, killed.  We thought he would simply descend back down to your 
realm of reality.  He would have been reborn, relived his life, maybe 
eventually re-ascend and become righteous again.  We were foolish.  
Lucifer was one of the oldest in that realm.  Through the years he had 
built up enormous amounts of energy causing his descent to error.  
This error created a rift, which made a dimension parallel to your 
own. Hell is what you would call it I assume.

&quot;Now the next question, &#39;why are you a scion.&#39;  Bloodlines can easily 
spread across the planet, and it just so happens you have the most 
genetics from Christ.&quot;

&quot;Wait, wouldn&#39;t one of my parents have more of his blood in them than 
me?&quot;  Karen said unsure of herself.

&quot;You are a smart girl, that&#39;s good.  I am not really supposed to tell 
you this kind of information, but we&#39;re short on time.  The reason why 
one of your parents isn&#39;t here instead of you is because neither of 
them are a Scion.&quot;

&quot;Are you saying I&#39;m adopted?&quot;  Karen asked as she stepped back.

&quot;No and yes.  It depends on what your definition of adopted is.  I 
will tell you this though; one of your parents is related to you by 
blood.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot;  Karen screamed as she took another step back.

&quot;Believe me not if it suits you, but you&#39;re the one who will have to 
square with the facts one day.&quot;

Karen felt empty.  She wanted to cry.  She always felt a weird 
connection between her parents, but it had to be something else.  She 
had asked them years ago if she was adopted would they tell her and 
they said yes.  So Karen asked them right there and her mother had 
said, &quot;No, you&#39;re my one and only child.&quot;

&quot;Listen to me now young one.  I have to tell you about your mission.  
To understand your mission you must first understand the situation.  
In 1783 A.D. of your time another angel, Zai; fell from heaven.  Zai 
was not killed like Lucifer; instead he descended of his own will, 
thus making him an incredibly powerful being in your world.  

&quot;Zai wanted to join Lucifer in his campaign against my world and asked 
to join Lucifer in his own world.  Lucifer refused.  Zai was 
incredibly angered by this and threatened to force himself into hell 
and then over throw Lucifer.

&quot;Lucifer himself was about twice as strong as Zai at the time and 
could have easily beat him, but the problem was if Lucifer entered 
your realm physically hell would be destroyed causing him to be 
reincarnated.  So to stop Zai before he entered hell, Lucifer sent all 
of his demon swarm to Earth to stop him.  Even with their combined 
might not even they could stop Zai.  When Lucifer&#39;s demon army had 
been reduced down to only 4 of his strongest, those 4 decided to merge 
their bodies and powers together into one being in a last gamble.  
Even then the new demon was unable to stand up to Zai.  The last final 
option was to put Zai under a seal spell.  The demon was successful 
and Zai is now deep under the Earth in an eternal sleep.&quot;

Grau stopped for a second and focused more on Karen.

&quot;This is where you come in dear.&quot;  He continued.  &quot;That dream you had 
where you were Titus Hope has every thing to do with this.  What you 
saw were the few moments before and after his death.&quot;

&quot;He didn&#39;t die though.&quot;  Karen said.

&quot;Exactly, that&#39;s the problem.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;That bar that almost went through his stomach was supposed to and 
kill him.  Lucifer cast an incredible spell that started to weaken the 
realities between hell and your dimension.  For the spell to work he 
needed an avatar to represent it on Earth.  That avatar is Titus.

&quot;He was hoping to do this in turn to resurrect Zai, then control him 
to do his deeds, and maybe even posses his body while also keeping 
hell in existence.  The problem is the spell will only break if Titus 
dies.  To ensure Titus&#39;s prolonged existence, Lucifer gave him a 
demonic power to keep Titus from death.  Titus can now see things 
happen in the future right before they happen.

&quot;To be blunt about this, we need you to kill Titus Hope.&quot;

&quot;What!?  I can&#39;t kill anyone!  Also, how would you even expect me to 
do it?&quot;

Grau chuckled.  &quot;Well, I said I was being blunt.  It is not you 
exactly who will be doing the killing.  What we need you to do is 
convince some one else who can kill him to do it.&quot;

&quot;Who?  I don&#39;t know anyone like that!&quot;  Karen asked.

&quot;A girl named Rumiko.  She recently came into a power that might 
enable her to kill Titus.&quot;

&quot;What power is this?&quot;  Karen asked smugly.

&quot;I will show you my dear.&quot;  Grau said, as the grassland seemed to melt 
away into at entirely different scene.

Karen looked around.  She seemed to be in some kind of shrine temple 
during the night.  Karen heard a noise come from her left and turned 
that way.  Some one was coming out of what looked like an old shed.  
Karen got the feeling she already knew who it was.

&quot;Is that Rumiko?&quot;  Karen asked.

&quot;Yes, now watch.  This is a vision of the very recent past of when she 
got her powers.&quot;

Karen watched as a young woman, maybe 19 or 20 years of age stepped 
out into the moonlight.  Rumiko had brown hair and her eyes were a 
very crystal like blue.  It reminded Karen of something, but it only 
took a few seconds for her to think of what.  Rumiko&#39;s eyes were the 
exact color Karen imagined &quot;Ice 9&quot; from &quot;Cat&#39;s Cradle&quot; would look 
like.

The next thing Karen noticed was the plain shorts and sleeveless shirt 
Rumiko wore.  She figured it probably just meant that Rumiko had been 
asleep recently.  Rumiko seemed tall for a Japanese woman.  Karen knew 
Rumiko&#39;s height was definitely nothing spectacular though.

Out of the corner of her eye, Karen noticed something.  She looked 
down to see black marks on Rumiko&#39;s left leg start to envelop it.  The 
black moved it&#39;s way up her body and engulfed her body on the left 
side.  Karen then noticed as Rumiko slowly shut her left eye and then 
quickly reopened it.  Her eye was now black instead of white, her Iris 
blood red, and her pupil slit like a cat or snake.

To Karen&#39;s right a man came bursting out of the house.  Karen thought 
the man was pretty handsome, but was way out of her age range.

&quot;That would be Rumiko&#39;s father, Shenamaru.&quot;  Grau whispered.

&quot;Oh, Rumiko.&quot;  Shenamaru whispered.  &quot;You never really understood it 
did you.  The vicious cycle of vengeance you got yourself sucked into.  
You are chasing after Ayane and Ren is chasing after you.  Please 
forgive me for not helping you.  I wanted you to experience this part 
of life for yourself and get over by yourself as well.  I&#39;m so 
foolish, but I can still save you yet.&quot;

&quot;Your too late.  Her body is mine.  She gave it up willingly.  Now I 
will destroy the bloodline of my condemner with one of his own 
descendents.  I also have your martial arts style as well.  When we 
merged I gained all of Rumiko&#39;s memories and she gained all of mine.&quot;  
Yamato No Orochi lowered her (his) head.  &quot;Now, the time for talk is 
almost over.  There is just one more thing I have to say.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;  Asked Shenamaru as he took a defensive stance.

Yamato raised her head with a smirk on her face.  &quot;The wind blows 
softly,

The earth slowly starts to rise,

And steal burns like fire.&quot;

The possessed Rumiko charged at her father with a straight out punch.  
Shenamaru tried to block it with his left palm, but the demon was too 
powerful.  It pushed his arm back and so he tightened his grip around 
Yamato&#39;s right fist.  Yamato retracted her hand like it was nothing 
and broke free from Shenamaru with out any effort.

Surprised by Yamato&#39;s strength, Shenamaru didn&#39;t notice the left hook 
the demon took at him.  He didn&#39;t have time to dodge and received a 
direct shot to his right rib cage.  He could hear and feel three ribs 
crack instantly.

Shenamaru flew down into the dirt.  He hadn&#39;t felt that kind of hit 
since he and his brother Shoji had fought for succession of the 
shrine.  Rumiko was strong granted, but she was only about three 
fourths as strong as him.  Yamato No Orochi&#39;s strength was greater 
than he could ever imagine.

All of a sudden Shenamaru saw Shoji and his fianc&#130;e in the doorway.

&quot;Get back!&quot;  He yelled.  &quot;Shoji, get the emergency scrolls and 
Talismans now!  Karamari, get back inside and make sure Ren and Hanou 
are stay safe!&quot;

They both immediately did what he said and disappeared from site.

&quot;You should have just told them to run away.&quot;  Yamato said smiling.  
&quot;I&#39;m going to kill all of you one by one.  But I won&#39;t touch them till 
I&#39;ve killed you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had it worse.&quot;  Shenamaru said as he stood back up.  This time 
he took the initiative and stuck first.  Shenamaru punched for 
Yamato&#39;s face as hard as he could.  He was shocked.  Yamato didn&#39;t 
move.  Shenamaru was a little worried now; he didn&#39;t want to put any 
scars on his daughter, especially her face.

Even though she was strong, her body wasn&#39;t invincible.  Her neck was 
leaned over and you could hear the smack when Shenamaru&#39;s fist hit 
Yamato&#39;s face.  She looked up now and a little drop of blood was 
oozing out of her mouth.

Yamato grabbed Shenamaru&#39;s right wrist with her left hand and took the 
front of his shirt with her right hand and then proceeded to throw him 
out into the yard onto his back.

Shenamaru slowly got back up as Yamato took her position a few meters 
in front of him.  As Shenamaru tried to get his balance back on his 
knees he felt a strange heat on his face and hands.  He looked up to 
see a blue light covering Yamato&#39;s upper body.  It was like she was on 
fire and the flames danced wildly in the wind.  Shenamaru knew this 
wasn&#39;t her aura, it was something completely different.

The flames then started to move and build up on her arms.  That&#39;s when 
it hit him; the light wasn&#39;t her aura or any type of Ki.  It was 
plasma.  One touch of it would burn through anything; there was 
nothing to defend against it.

Shenamaru knew that the human body didn&#39;t naturally produce plasma 
unless under certain circumstances and he had no chance against 
Yamato.  He knew what his only option was.

Rumiko was in a dream where she was fighting Ayane instead of her 
father.  This was how Yamato kept Rumiko from realizing what she was 
really doing. The flames started to work it&#39;s way down Yamato&#39;s arms 
and started to consume her fore arms just the same as the hate was 
consuming Rumiko&#39;s heart.

Yamato stuck her arms forward and the flames started to clash between 
her palms.  A ball started to form from the blazing energy resembling 
that of a small sun.

Shenamaru finally lifted himself up off of his knees and staggered for 
only a second.  The next thing Yamato knew the grown man under her 
arms and coming back up with an uppercut.  Shenamaru&#39;s fist connected 
with the possessed girl&#39;s jaw creating a thunderous clap.  With the 
force of the impact, Yamato&#39;s body flew upwards and she couldn&#39;t keep 
the plasma attack together causing it to dissipate.

Yamato couldn&#39;t understand what had happened.  She was defeating the 
host&#39;s father easily and then he gained a sudden speed almost 
undetectable to even her eyes.

As Yamato&#39;s body rose into the air, Shenamaru jumped up behind her and 
grabbed her arms and put her in a full nelson.  He then pulled his 
body backwards and brought Yamato head first into the ground.  
Shenamaru jumped back from Yamato&#39;s motionless body.

The snake demon was burning hot with anger.  She threw herself up and 
charged with her hand back ready to strike Shenamaru with a punch.  
Just as Yamato reached Shenamaru he disappeared.  Yamato eyes went 
wide as she realized the martial artist was now behind her, holding 
onto her right wrist with his left hand.  There was no time to react 
as Shenamaru yanked her arm so hard her feet came up off of the ground 
and her body came back towards him.  Just as Yamato started to turn 
her head towards Shenamaru he gave her a hard right punch to the face.  
The force of the attack caused Yamato&#39;s new body to fly about 5 meters 
through the air before it landed.

As Yamato stood back up, Shenamaru could see the blood trickling from 
her mouth glimmer in the moonlight.  He flinched to see his daughter 
hurt by his own attack.  Damn it, where was Shoji?

Shenamaru decided to take one more attack.  He charged towards Yamato.  
She put up her arms to defend, but Shenamaru did a 360o spin around 
Yamato and landed a kick right in between her shoulder blades on her 
spine.  Yamato could only see a blur of Shenamaru before she flew 
forward and found herself face down in the dirt.  She tried to get 
back up but couldn&#39;t.  Shenamaru was holding her down.

Just then Shoji came running from the house with all sorts of scrolls 
and talismans in his hands.

&quot;Quick, put the seal in place!&quot;  Shenamaru yelled.

Shoji listened and quickly placed four talismans on the ground around 
Yamato.  The girl quickly fell unconscious.

Karen was Awestruck.  She had seen some very skilled and well known 
Martial Artists fight before with her own two eyes, but she didn&#39;t 
know this level of skill was humanly possible.  Karen had heard all 
the fairy tales and rumors of secrete fighting societies, but she 
never thought they really existed.

Just as Shenamaru fell over and fainted, Karen&#39;s vision started to 
blur.  The scene quickly changed back to the empty grassland she was 
in before.  Grau stepped in front of her.

&quot;So now you have seen Rumiko and what she is capable of.&quot;  Grau said 
as he folded his hands together.

&quot;Wait, didn&#39;t she loose though?&quot;  Karen asked in confusion.

Grau chuckled.  &quot;Yes, but I don&#39;t think you fully understand what 
happened there.  Ask Rumiko about it when you go to her.  The 
vengeance in her heart will help release the demon in her and that 
will give her the strength she needs to kill a person.  At the same 
time you need to befriend her and keep the demon from taking full 
control.&quot;

Karen had a sickening feeling in her gut.  Grau words didn&#39;t settle 
well with her.

&quot;One last thing,&quot; Grau said as he held up a finger.  &quot;You will be 
given a gift that martial artists would be envious of.  From now on 
you will be able to fully see a persons aura.  Even some of the most 
talented martial artists and psychics can&#39;t see a persons aura 
clearly.&quot;

&quot;Hey! Wait!&quot;  Karen shouted as Grau turned his back to her.  &quot;You said 
this was a mission for God, but from what I heard from you God 
doesn&#39;t&#39; exist.&quot;

Grau turned his head back around.  &quot;I didn&#39;t say that.  All I said is 
what you call heaven is just a higher level of existence and that most 
religions are wrong.  I could tell you the truth, but you will find 
out soon enough and I&#39;m not supposed to tell you otherwise.  Good bye 
now.&quot;

Everything went hazy.  Karen closed her eyes then reopened them to 
find she was staring up at ceiling.  Karen realized she was in a 
hospital bed.  An IV was in her left arm and gauze bandages around her 
head.

Karen realized an unconscious Kumi was leaning over asleep on her bed.  
Karen sighed and turned her head over to the right and looked out 
through the door and watched the nurses and doctors walk through the 
hall.

Karen eyes widened as she saw Rumiko with her head down leaning up 
against the wall from across her room.  Karen tried to mouth words, 
but ended looking like a fish out of water.  Rumiko looked up from the 
floor and straight into Karen&#39;s eyes.

Next Chapter, Rumiko awakes to the damages she caused and to her 
almost crippled father.  Will she be able to fix their lives and 
exactly how did Shenamaru win?  &quot;Chapter 004 (Rumiko) Aftermath.&quot;
