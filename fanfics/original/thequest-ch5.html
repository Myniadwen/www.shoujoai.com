Snow White&#39;s chainmail shirt weighted her body down,
her longsword heavy on her back as they rose on.
Rosebud whinnied softly, the great red stallion&#39;s
hooves thumping on the cobblestones as they went
through the outer gate, the streets busy with
travelers and merchants.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Snow reassured the beast softly,
&quot;I&#39;m just tired.&quot;

The guards looked her over warily, young men who
clearly looked inexperienced with the swords that they
wore, but the three men seemed to gain confidence from
their numbers as they moved to block her way. &quot;What is
your business in the city?&quot; the leader demanded
boldly, the brown haired boy gesturing with his spear.

&quot;My business is my own,&quot; Rose answered mildly, her
black braid flowing down on her winter cloak. While
her voice was pleasant her eyes carried the confidence
of a experienced warrior, something the boys instantly
noticed. She had been out adventuring for some months
now, earning coin with her valor and sword, and it had
made her a fighter of great skill.

&quot;I think my lord would demand to hear more,&quot; the lead
guard blustered, waving his spear around dramatically.

Rosebud looked at the wooden object being waved in his
face with pure annoyance, whuffing out a breath in
warning. With surprising speed the stallion lunged
forward, biting the top of the shaft off and sending
the spear&#39;s iron head clattering to the ground.

&quot;Rosebud!&quot; Snow thumped him gently with her fist on
the side of the neck, &quot;I know they were being rude
shoving that spear in your face, but that was a bit
much.&quot;

Rosebud whinnied, but not terribly apologetically.

&quot;That.. I.. you...&quot; the guard stammered, looking at
the end of broken spear in disbelief, then gazing at
the stallion in fear.

The younger guard, blonde hair flowing grabbed his
comrade&#39;s arm, &quot;I think we shouldn&#39;t interfere with
this person any more.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; he blinked.

&quot;That is a war-horse,&quot; the blonde hissed, &quot;not some
common steed. And no one but those of noble blood
could have such a one!&quot;

&quot;But he looked like a common mercenary,&quot; the third
guard blurted.

&quot;She, actually,&quot; Snow said with amusement.

Just then a cheerful voice called out in greeting,
&quot;Snow!&quot;

Snow White looked up in surprise, seeing a young woman
cutting through the crowd to gaze at her in honest
disbelief. It had been many months since she had seen
her former lady&#39;s maid Alice, but the honey blonde
looked a beautiful as ever, her fine clothes and
bodyguard showing that she was working for someone of
high status. &quot;Alice,&quot; she nodded respectfully, &quot;you
look good.&quot;

&quot;Refer to her as princess,&quot; the guard recovered enough
of his nerve to demand, looking at her in appalled
shock.

&quot;Princess?&quot; Snow blinked in surprise.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alice smiled up at her, &quot;my father sent
me to serve in your household to teach me humility,
with your noble mother&#39;s permission.&quot;

A faintly amused look appeared on Snow&#39;s face, then
she chuckled softly. At Alice&#39;s questioning look she
explained, &quot;I think it&#39;s fairly ironic, considering
that my mother hired you with the hope of civilizing
me.&quot;

Alice chuckled warmly, her eyes crinkling in amusement
as she agreed, &quot;Indeed.&quot; She studied Snow a moment,
&quot;Do you have a place to spend the night?&quot;

&quot;Not yet, I was about to find a inn when these
gentlemen,&quot; Snow nodded to the guards, &quot;felt it
needful to inquire of my purpose here.&quot;

The three guards, seeing Snow and Alice talk so
familiarly, had realized they were in far deeper than
expected. With no other option they tried to look as
innocent as possible, a difficult task considering the
broken spear and Rosebud&#39;s dangerous glare.

Dismissing them with a glance Alice smiled up at Snow,
&quot;I would be honored if you&#39;d accept the hospitality of
our castle and my Father and Mother. In truth, I think
no inn in our city would be worthy of you, anyway.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure that you have many fine inns,&quot; Snow
countered, &quot;and in truth I have grown used to such
conditions.&quot;

Rose reached up, placing a hand over Snow&#39;s still
holding on to the reins. &quot;We would be lessened without
your company,&quot; she met Snow&#39;s eyes, &quot;and in truth, I
would hear of your adventures too, unfiltered by the
songs of bards and minstrels.&quot;

Snow smiled, realizing she wasn&#39;t going to be able to
politely get out of this. Besides, when Alice had been
her maid Rose had rarely given in to her wishes, it
was a little enough thing to do so now. &quot;All right,&quot;
she smiled, &quot;I&#39;d be honored.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Alice clapped her hands, &quot;now, where is the
rest of your baggage caravan? We can get your maids
and servants to ready rooms at the palace.&quot;

Snow patted the saddlebags on Rosebud as she said
wryly, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to say this is it, princess. I tend
to travel light.&quot;

Alice blinked then she shook her head, laughing
fondly. &quot;I should have remembered,&quot; she said, &quot;you are
a most unusual princess, Snow.&quot;

&quot;So I&#39;ve been told,&quot; Snow agreed, the two heading up
to the palace together, talking softly as they caught
each other up with their lives.

Alice had left the palace of the Wicked Queen shortly
after Snow left for the second time, slipping away
into the morning light. &quot;And without even telling me
you were going,&quot; Alice gave her a faintly wounded
look.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Snow said, feeling a pang of guilt as
they moved through the town. They had been friends,
despite their wildly different natures, the feminine
Alice and the more tough, boyish Snow, and she should
have at least bid her farewell.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Alice smiled a bit sadly, &quot;I suppose
you know we would have only tried to talk you out of
leaving.&quot; Her own homecoming had been a joyous one,
only marred by her still unmarried status. Sadly few
princes of quality had passed through the kingdom, and
those that had Alice considered to be utterly
unsuitable.

&quot;Good princes are hard to find,&quot; Snow agreed as they
passed the gates to the palace&#39;s courtyard, thinking
of how her sister Rose Red had found a princess,
instead.

&quot;I still have hope,&quot; Alice said, eyes faintly amused.

Before Snow could ask what she meant by that grooms
arrived to help her off her steed and unloaded her
saddle bags. &quot;Be careful of him, he bites,&quot; she warned
the boys.

Rosebud whuffed out a disappointed sound.

&quot;Just making it sporting,&quot; Snow answered him with a
smile.

&quot;I see his bad temper hasn&#39;t changed,&quot; Alice laughed
as they went inside, the light blue walls of the
palace sweeping up around them.

&quot;I doubt you expected it to,&quot; Snow agreed as they
walked side by side, the sound of a groom howling in
pain heard behind them. She looked at Alice curiously.
&quot;I&#39;ve always wondered, why is this kingdom called
Wonderland?&quot;

&quot;While the towns and villages are quite safe,&quot; Alice
explained, &quot;the dark woods are full of many wild and
weird creatures such as talking caterpillars and
Cheshire Cats. So it eventually acquired the name
Wonderland.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Snow nodded.

A page arrived to escort Snow to her rooms as Alice
smiled sunnily, &quot;I&#39;ll see you at dinner then.&quot; She
hesitated, &quot;If you like, I could have some clothes
sent up...?&quot;

&quot;I think I have something that should do,&quot; Snow
reassured her with a smile.

Later that evening Alice fidgeted as her noble mother
looked on in amusement. The Queen
of Hearts smiled faintly, &quot;I have rarely seen you so
nervous, Alice. Is she truly so fearsome?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Alice shook her head, her green dress flowing as
she made herself sit still, &quot;I just want things to be
perfect.&quot;

The King of Spades looked curious, &quot;And does Snow
White know about your intentions towards her?&quot;

Alice paled, &quot;Father!&quot;

The Queen of Hearts was faintly scolding, &quot;We have
heard you speak so glowingly of Snow for months, you
have not been subtle my daughter.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Alice looked down, blushing. &quot;I hope to
tell her tonight,&quot; she confessed.

It was only a few moments later that a page opened the
door and Snow entered the dining room, bowing slightly
to the king and queen She had exchanged her travel
stained clothes for a fancy silken blouse and
trousers, her boots gleaming, and she made quite the
striking figure.

Alice&#39;s heart nearly skipped a beat as she met those
blue eyes, gazing at that handsome face. &#39;In truth I
know why I found all those princes so unacceptable,&#39;
Alice mused, &#39;I was comparing them all to you, dear
Snow.&#39;

&quot;Welcome Snow White,&quot; the Queen of Hearts nodded, &quot;we
have heard of your adventures from the bards and much
about you from our beloved daughter Alice.&quot;

Snow tossed Alice a look, amused to see her blush
faintly. &quot;In truth such tales are exaggerated,&quot; she
answered modestly, &quot;but I&#39;m honored to be welcomed
here.&quot;

&quot;I would enjoy hearing your tales,&quot; the King of Spades
said warmly, &quot;for it has been a long time since such
an adventurer has come to our lands.&quot;

&quot;I will do my humble best,&quot; Snow conceded.

The meal was lively, the food well made and the
company quite entertaining. To relieve Snow of
storytelling duties the royal family spoke of the
wonders of their land and the strangeness that
occasionally happened. In truth the time flew by, and
eventually sated they all parted.

&quot;May I accompany you to your rooms?&quot; Alice asked as he
parents left.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; Snow nodded and they left together.
Walking the halls she added, &quot;In truth, I had hoped to
apologize to you.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Alice blinked.

Snow smiled faintly. &quot;I&#39;m well aware of how much of a
handful I was to you,&quot; she explained, &quot;and I&#39;ve felt a
little guilty about that.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Alice said as she set a hand on her arm, &quot;I
suspect I&#39;d resist, too, if someone sought to change
my nature.&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; Snow shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m just contrary by
nature.&quot; They reached her door and she placed her hand
on the handle, &quot;Thank you for a fine evening.&quot;

&quot;In truth, I hoped it would not end so soon,&quot; from
beneath her dress Alice drew a flask out, &quot;would you
care to join me?&quot;

Snow laughed as they entered her rooms, &quot;Where did you
get that?&quot;

&quot;As a young girl I got very good at sneaking things
from the kitchen,&quot; Alice said with amusement. Cups
were quickly produced from a cupboard and she poured a
bit in each before handing one to Rose, &quot;Here you go.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Snow said as they sat together on the
bed. They each took a drink, the room pleasantly quiet
then Snow softly said, &quot;I&#39;ve thought about you at
times, you know.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Alice looked over at her shyly.

&quot;Do you remember when I left the first time?&quot; Snow
asked. A faint smile, &quot;The feeling of your kiss on my
cheek still lingers in my memory even now.&quot;

&quot;In truth that wasn&#39;t where I had intended to kiss
you,&quot; Alice admitted, &quot;my nerve failed me at the last
moment.&quot;

Snow reached out to place a gentle hand on Alice&#39;s
chin, turning her to meet her eyes. &quot;Where did you
want to kiss me?&quot; Snow asked, her voice husky.

&quot;Here,&quot; Alice leaned forward and pressed her lips to
Snow&#39;s, feeling a surge of joy as the taller woman
returned the kiss gently.

Blushing Snow moved back, her cheeks bright red. &quot;Me,
too,&quot; she confessed, &quot;and for longer than I&#39;d care to
admit.&quot;

&quot;Maybe we should try to make up for lost time?&quot; Alice
suggested, grasping Snow&#39;s drink then setting them
both aside.

&quot;Lets,&quot; Snow agreed, both sliding down to the bed. She
stroked Alice&#39;s hair back as she softly added, &quot;But..
I don&#39;t want this to be just a one night thing.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t be,&quot; Alice snuggled close, &quot;I have loved you
a long time... my prince.&quot;

End.

Notes: Yes, that&#39;s Alice in Wonderland from Chapter
One. I had always intended to follow up on her
sometime but space constraints in the first four
chapters kinda held me back.. as it was this chapter
was nearly a third longer than my usual ones. Still, I
think it went pretty well.</pre>
