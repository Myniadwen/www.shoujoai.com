(Prologue: Izule, a common fisherman&#39;s daughter, dreams of one day 
escaping her dreary life. One day, she wanders into a forest, her life 
taking a dramatic turn after that...)

Izule/Olivia Narrating: My name is Izule&#151;an uncommon and beautiful name 
for a very common and very plain young lady. I was born in a fishing 
village crammed between the ocean and the woods, a place of inactivity 
and peace, where the only source of real entertainment, outside of the 
humble library and the rumor mill, was the imagination of youngsters. I 
was one of the many children who used their thoughts to dream of other 
worlds, imaginary places we could go to when the real world became dull, 
but I never thought I would actually visit those places. One day...

Dad/Rai: Izule! Be sure you don&#39;t wander out too far!

Mom/Ayanna: Be back home in time for supper!

Izule/Olivia Narrating: Those are my parents. They&#39;re pretty typical 
when it comes to being parents&#151;really nothing special about them. The 
whole village wasn&#39;t anything special; the only thing you could really 
call unique was our imaginations. On that day, I went to play in the 
small forest that protected our sleepy little town from the rest of the 
sleepy little world. I was in no danger, for nothing surprising was ever 
found there. Or was there...? (Izule wanders through the forest, picking 
flowers and tracing lines in the dirt)

Voice: Izule...

Izule/Olivia: (stammering) W-who&#39;s there?

Voice: Izule...

Izule/Olivia: Where are you?

Voice: Izule...

Izule/Olivia: W-what&#39;s happening? (she screams. The world turns black)

Izule/Olivia Narrating: From that moment on, my life was going to take a 
very unusual, amazing turn! (End prologue)

(Act One: Izule finds herself in the Other World)

Are we strangers in this place

Looking for a place unknown?

We&#39;re just leaning on the breeze

Saying not to give it up

Can we find the truth behind us

When the long journey ends?

Are we wrapped in mysteries

Walking down the winding roads?

Can we find the reason why we are

In this world of trials?

Here comes the breeze, that&#39;s whispering in peace

So full of lights, shining in colors

Don&#39;t be afraid, just keep on trying in your way

And you will see a holy sight

Are we strangers in this place

Reaching out for a dream unknown?

Now we feel our minds are flying high

In this world of liberty

Here comes the breeze, that&#39;s whispering again

So full of light, shining in colors

Listen to me, just keep on trying in your way

Get the courage to open the door

And soon you&#39;ll be free!

(Izule finds herself in a strange new place)

Izule/Olivia: What is this? Where am I? This isn&#39;t the forest! This 
is...

Guard/Vai: Halt! You there!

Izule/Olivia: Who&#39;s there? What? Men in armor? This isn&#39;t the village! 
H-hey!

(Izule is taken by the soldiers to the Castle, where she meets the Crazy 
Queen Gertrude and the Sane Princess Jane)

Gertrude/Usha: So you are the monster people have been talking about!

Izule/Olivia: I don&#39;t know what you mean! I just got here and...where am 
I, anyway?

Gertrude/Usha: Silence, demon! I should have my soldiers slay you for 
causing such trouble!

Izule/Olivia: What trouble, what did I do?

Gertrude/Usha: Ha! You play me for a fool, creature! I know it was you 
who released the great vile dragon upon this land! His emergence from 
the land of shadow coincides with your appearance! Therefore you must 
have awakened him, brutal beast! Are you his master or his servant, vile 
wretched worm?!

Izule/Olivia: (shouting) I haven&#39;t done anything! I don&#39;t know what 
you&#39;re talking about! I just got here and I still do not know 
where...&quot;here&quot; is!

Gertrude/Usha: Silence! Be quiet! I will be rid of you before this very 
day is over! Guards, execute her!

Jane/Gabrielle: Mother, wait.

Gertrude/Usha: Yes, child?

Jane/Gabrielle: Mother, would it not be better to put her to some use? 
If she has done wrong, would it not make more sense for her to undo it? 
If she fails, she is dead anyway, but if she succeeds, we shall know she 
is no enemy, for what monster could so readily redress a wrong they 
consciously performed?

Gertrude/Usha: Hmm...you speak well, Janette. Very well, I shall allow 
her to go out and destroy the dragon, as a sign of...good faith. (she 
smiles wickedly) However, I cannot have her wandering about all alone. 
Even faith must first be tested. You, guard!

Guard/Vai: My liege!

Gertrude/Usha: Escort this creature to the lair of the dragon. However, 
do not assist her in any way.

Guard/Vai: (looks relieved) Yes, your highness! Come, you! (Guard leads 
a still-stunned Izule out into the courtyard)

Izule/Olivia: Wait, wait! Hold on! I&#39;m not a demon, I&#39;m just a girl!

Guard/Vai: The Queen&#39;s word is absolute! You will slay this dragon or 
die trying!

Izule/Olivia: That&#39;s what I&#39;m worried about! I&#39;m not a warrior either!

Guard/Vai: If you are no monster, then surely you have some other unique 
quality, for I have never seen your kind before. Now move! (Izule moans 
to herself as the Guard leads her to the dragon&#39;s lair. They are 
suddenly stopped by a flash of light)

Izule/Olivia: NOW what?!

Voice: Release the girl! So commands the God of Wind and Rain!

Guard/Vai: (screaming) The great God of Wind and Rain! (stammering) I-I 
o-obey y-your c-command, m-milord! T-the girl is y-yours! (he runs off; 
Izule starts crying)

Voice: Weep not, child, for I know you well.

Izule/Olivia: (startled) It&#39;s the voice from the forest. Who are you? 
(the god appears)

God/Alisha: I am the God of Wind and Rain, one of the four deities who 
watch over the world you are now in. It was I who summoned you here, 
Izule, from your world.

Izule/Olivia: I...don&#39;t understand.

God/Alisha: I have heard your thoughts, Izule, and have deemed you most 
worthy to be drawn here. Was this not what you wanted?

Izule/Olivia: Oh...I guess so. But I&#39;m so scared right now. They say I 
have to fight a dragon! Is this true?

God/Alisha: No, the Queen who spoke to you is...irritable. This dragon 
she referred to only comes round once every hundred years, and so nobody 
really believed him to be real until you came. The Queen is prone to 
acting before she thinks.

Izule/Olivia: So do I have to fight him or not?

God/Alisha: No, he is a very friendly dragon, an old friend of mine, 
actually. However, the Queen will not believe this, so you must follow 
my advice. In order for the Queen to respect you and see that you are 
indeed powerful, yet not a threat, you must tame the dragon.

Izule/Olivia: What? But won&#39;t that be dangerous?

God/Alisha: No, Izule&#151;like I said, he is very friendly. But you will 
have to at least confront him. I will help you if you need it in the 
future. For now, I have done everything necessary. Keep following this 
path, and eventually you will find the dragon. Fare thee well.

Izule/Olivia: Wait! (he vanishes in a windstorm) Oh, this is just great! 
What a horrible day! If I had known this was going to happen, I would&#39;ve 
wished for something else. Why did I ever think I&#39;d be happier outside 
the village?

Jane/Gabrielle: So it is true! (Izule turns and sees Princess Janette 
approaching her, smiling) Hi! Sorry I didn&#39;t introduce myself; my mother 
isn&#39;t exactly an expert in social affairs. Though I guess you knew that 
from the &quot;warm welcome&quot; she gave you.

Izule/Olivia: You&#39;re that princess, aren&#39;t you?

Jane/Gabrielle: Yes, and my name is Janette, though you may address me 
as just Jane.

Izule/Olivia: Jane?

Jane/Gabrielle: Yes. Only my friends call me that. I&#39;d like to be your 
friend. You fascinate me. I&#39;d heard you came from outside the kingdom, 
but another world??

Izule/Olivia: So you heard my conversation with that god?

Jane/Gabrielle: Yes, I did. You must be a lucky girl; the God of Wind 
and Rain does not show himself to just anybody. Now I&#39;d like to help you 
even more because of that; you are to slay the dragon, right?

Izule/Olivia: Actually, I think I&#39;m supposed to tame it.

Jane/Gabrielle: Amazing! That shall prove to be even more difficult! Of 
course, my mother will not trust you if you do this, but she&#39;s not the 
type to trust people anyway. Come, let us go.

Izule/Olivia Narrating: And so I made my first friend in this new world. 
Unbelievable, how just an hour ago I was an unknown girl, living in a 
sleepy little village dreaming of faraway places, and now here I was in 
this strange place, a beautiful princess beside me and a dragon to tame 
before me! I had to admit, maybe being here might not be so bad after 
all... (End Act One)

(Act Two: Izule goes on many adventures with her new friends, and grows 
up in her new home)

(Izule and Jane arrive at the lair of the dragon)

Jane/Gabrielle: I never imagined this place could look so...nice!

Izule/Olivia: Neither could I. In my world, dragon&#39;s lairs are usually 
said to be dark and morbid.

Jane/Gabrielle: What a fascinating place you must come from! Listen! Do 
you hear it? (a growling sound is heard as the Old Dragon lumbers out)

Bert/Yuki: What do you want?

Izule and Jane: (amazed) THIS is the dragon??

Bert/Yuki: Ho, I&#39;m the dragon, all right, and not in the mood to say 
otherwise. What do you two damsels want of me? If you&#39;re looking to trap 
yourselves up in my cave so a dashing knight will come and rescue you, 
forget it! I tried that nonsense before and got toasted for it! I&#39;ve 
been reformed too long to remember how to keep you girls captive anyway.

Jane/Gabrielle: No, sir-dragon, we&#39;ve not come to be captured by you.

Bert/Yuki: Oh? Is it my treasure, then? Sorry, I gave all that away ages 
ago. You&#39;d never seen so many little kids scared of a dragon with gold 
falling out of his paws&#151;though I guess those &quot;kids&quot; are all in their 
graves now, and their descendants rich and still afraid of me!

Jane/Gabrielle: No, we didn&#39;t come for that either.

Bert/Yuki: My scales, is it? They&#39;re so old they&#39;re worthless&#151;but take 
them, they&#39;re falling off like crazy. I might be the world&#39;s first bald 
dragon at this rate!

Jane/Gabrielle: No, sir, we just came to challenge you...um...to a duel!

Izule/Olivia: Y-yes. I, uh...I was ordered to...

Bert/Yuki: Oh, a duel, huh? Come to slay me at last? Well good! About 
time I fight my way out of this silly life. Well, neither of you look 
much like warriors, but who cares? You&#39;re probably much stronger than me 
at any rate, what with my rheumatism and bad back...

Jane/Gabrielle: No, sir, just to tame you. So Lady Izule here can 
convince my mother of her worth.

Bert/Yuki: Oh? (looks interested) Oh! So you&#39;re Izule, eh? Yes, yes, 
Wind and Rain was whispering about you, wasn&#39;t he? Said I had to follow 
you and do as you say. Well, I guess it beats sleeping and being 
harassed by those young hoodlum knights. Where to, milady?

Izule/Olivia: Uh, wait. Are you really going along with this?

Bert/Yuki: Sure, what have I got to lose? I haven&#39;t much life in me 
anyway, perhaps three or four more centuries to go.

Izule/Olivia: Um...thank you?

Izule/Olivia Narrating: Old Bert, as he was called, proved to be as 
great a friend as the guardian god claimed, and more. Funny, polite, and 
impish, he was like a grandfather to us both. He was also an effective 
bodyguard, for much of the countryside was populated by wretched 
creatures, who all ran off at the sight of such a beast. Bert, though, 
just laughed.

Bert/Yuki: All I have to do is shiver, and the goblins run home to their 
dark caves. Ha! I guess I still got it, then. So, Princess Jane, you say 
your mother won&#39;t much like my appearance?

Jane/Gabrielle: No, sir, but she&#39;s never one to like things that 
disagree with her tastes.

Bert/Yuki: Hmm. I&#39;m not offended. I&#39;ve never been much liked, not even 
by the other dragons. Only a fool or a god could love such a terrible 
face! (he growls playfully)

Izule/Olivia: (laughing) Sir-dragon, I have grown fond of you already!

Bert/Yuki: You have, huh? Well then, fools, gods, and stout-hearted 
young maidens, I guess. I picked the right lady to follow! (Izule 
blushes humbly. As they reach the castle, the guards run in fear of 
Bert, who doesn&#39;t do anything but follow the girls inside. Even Queen 
Gertrude is massively frightened of the creature)

Jane/Gabrielle: Mother, we have returned! The horrible beast has been 
tamed by Lady Izule!

Gertrude/Usha: Great merciful heavens, get that monstrosity out of here! 
Oh, my poor nerves!

Jane/Gabrielle: But mother, he is a good dragon.

Gertrude/Usha: Utter nonsense! The only good dragon is a dead dragon!

Izule/Olivia: Your highness...I have tamed this mighty beast. Am I not 
worthy of life?

Gertrude/Usha: Just get him out of here! Name anything for your price!

Izule/Olivia: Anything? (smiles mischievously)

God/Alisha Narrating: Izule&#39;s wish was to live in the kingdom freely as 
a citizen. She easily befriended Princess Jane, who taught Izule the 
ways of royalty and the court, until she grew to become a fine lady. The 
old dragon Bert became her lifelong companion and bodyguard, and taught 
her, with just a little help from yours truly, how to fight in real 
combat, and how to carry herself in chivalrous and noble acts.

The years passed. Izule aged, and turned into a woman, wise in the ways 
of her new home. Soon her fame spread, and she was sought after by 
princes and suitors&#151;and also fierce rivals and assassins. The Queen grew 
to trust Izule, and eventually loved her as a second daughter, sometimes 
even confusing she and Jane for sisters&#151;but that was probably the best 
title for them to have. Despite this trust, she often sent her 
&quot;daughter&quot; and new champion off to slay monsters&#151;perhaps because they 
were threats, or perhaps she was just plain nuts.

Ah, I remember those adventurous days so well...

Jane/Gabrielle: I can&#39;t believe my mother asked you to vanquish the 
mighty Minotaur!

Izule/Olivia: I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going through with it! (Minotaur 
approaches)

Minotaur/Blake: Grr! Who dares enter my lair?!

Bert/Yuki: Stop saying that!

Minotaur/Blake: I&#39;ll kill you for disturbing this place!

God/Alisha: These mythical monsters have such fragile egos... They 
really must get out more often. (Izule fights and defeats the Minotaur)

Jane/Gabrielle: My hero! (hugs her) Maybe next time, I could fight with 
you.

Bert/Yuki: Yes, I&#39;m sure your mother would approve of that...

God/Alisha Narrating: Or how about the time we faced off against the 
Siren and the Centaur?

Siren/Nomi: (singing) Come hither, come hither, come o&#39;er the plain, 
come travelers now, for fortune to gain!

Jane/Gabrielle: Must...approach...

Bert/Yuki: Bah, what an awful song!

Siren/Nomi: Eek, a horrible dragon! (leaps off her rock and drowns)

Bert/Yuki: (stunned) Hohoho, what a simple task!

God/Alisha: There is still one more. Beware, O my champion!

Izule/Olivia: I know! I must tame this next creature! Jane, match his 
arrows, and Bert his stride! O God of Wind and Rain, give me strength as 
I swing my lance!

Centaur/Mira: Such allies shall not avail you! (they each contribute to 
fighting the centaur) No! Alack, that such grace and nobility be 
destroyed in the prime of life!

God/Alisha Narrating: I think our greatest adventure was against the 
Sphinx, though. Here is where my champion truly proved her worth!

Sphinx/June: Travelers, if you can appease me, I shall let you pass, and 
great fame shall be yours! Yet if you do not, your lives shall be mine!

God/Alisha: Be strong, Izule!

Jane/Gabrielle: We are with you, my sister!

Bert/Yuki: Ugh, a riddle. Blast this Alzheimer&#39;s of mine!

Sphinx/June: Two brothers stand on a hill, Sir Green and Sir Yellow. One 
speaks only the truth, the other tells only lies. By asking only one 
question, how would you determine which is which?

Izule/Olivia: A perplexing riddle, indeed. Give me time to think! (paces 
around thinking) I know! If the man were his brother, which would he say 
is the truth-telling man?

Sphinx/June: They would both respond the same way, that Sir Green is the 
truth-telling man.

Izule/Olivia: Then I choose...Sir Yellow!

Sphinx/June: Correct. But how did you know?

Izule/Olivia: If he was the truth-telling man, then what he said would 
be a lie, because he will answer truthfully what his lying brother will 
say. Therefore, I can safely say that the answer will be the opposite of 
what he said. On the other hand, if he was the lying man, then he would 
tell me what his truth-telling brother would say, but it would be a lie. 
Therefore, the answer will also be the opposite of what he said. 
Understand?

Sphinx/June: (bewildered) Uh... Of course!

Bert/Yuki: Truly she has a dizzying intellect.

Jane/Gabrielle: Wait until she gets going!

God/Alisha Narrating: Ah, wonderful days. Izule soon came to reign as my 
representative, a title which lasted for many wonderful years. 
Eventually she won the hearts of many, including the fair princess, who, 
after her mother perished in a fit of disease, became the new Queen of 
the land. She rejected all suitors, though, perhaps because none had 
captivated her heart so greatly as Izule herself had. Their love was 
romanticized in thousands of stories, though none came close to 
achieving the beauty of Fact. As for the others, Bert the old dragon was 
recognized as the peaceful scoundrel he was and achieved amnesty, and 
worship of the guardian gods increased as I and the others roamed the 
land frequently. And thus, the kingdom entered a golden age...or so it 
would seem.

Izule/Olivia Narrating: Yes, or so it would seem&#151;for one night, as I was 
wandering outside the castle with my lady and my love, the beautiful 
Queen Jane, I came across a rather harsh monster who had it in his mind 
to knock me unconscious, and from this black void I did not wake&#151;at 
least not in the way I thought I would... (End Act Two)

(Act Three. Izule wakes up and finds herself back at home, ten years 
later...)

So far away from my home, sweet home
Day by day, from land to land I roam
Though told by the wind which way to go
Oh, how I long for my home, sweet home
You can come home in times of harshness
You may come home in times of sorrow, too
Your home will be waiting for you forever
It will be waiting for you forever
Fragrant blossoms blooming far away&#151;
Do my folks see them as I did long ago?
Are they still joyful? Are they young at heart?
Will I see them again as I did that day?
Family, friends
Home and memories
No one will ever
Forget about you
How far I&#39;ve come from my childhood home!
There will come a time when my troubles are gone
And when I shall not be all alone&#151;
Till then, I dream of my home, sweet home
Forest, stream
Sky and earth
Everyone is waiting
Waiting for your return

(Izule wakes up in a tree, decked out in her armor and fine clothes)

Izule/Olivia: What be this? Some new trickery? ...My lady! Jane, where 
are you? Be you safe? And the monster! Oh, why am I here, when she could 
be in trouble! God of Wind and Rain, please come to my aid!

Mina/Blake: What are you babbling about up there? (surprised suddenly) 
What the devil! What are you... (screams and runs away)

Izule/Olivia: (stunned) Was that...Mina? From home? Am I back in the 
village? But how? (she descends and walks the familiar path back. The 
town is in a tizzy)

Sirea/Nomi: An angel! A shining angel was in the tree!

Sienna/Mira: Such a frightening creature! Armed with a blazing sword! 
She speaks an ancient tongue!

Fiona/June: They say she resembles the mother of the lost girl!

Izule/Olivia: Oh my, it seems nothing has changed since my departure. 
Those old biddies are still spreading those crazy rumors. Well, at least 
they think they remember me...though have the years I spent in that 
wonderful world truly passed here as well? (she walks around, amidst a 
town full of buzzing people, until she comes to her old house) It is 
said that there is no place like home, but I feel as if I truly belong 
back there, in that other world, and not in this place. (Izule&#39;s mother 
and father emerge and are shocked)

Mom/Ayanna: Good heavens! I thought all those rumors were just fake!

Dad/Rai: This is a creature from the heavens, unless our eyes are bad! 
Are you...real?

Izule/Olivia: I can no longer distinguish between reality and falsehood, 
though my memory remains. You are my parents, and I your lost daughter, 
Izule!

Dad/Rai: Izule? Can it really be you? After so many years...

Mom/Ayanna: What has happened to you, my daughter, to create such a 
change? (Izule cries out as she embraces her parents)

Izule/Olivia: Mother, father! I cannot say...! I truly cannot describe 
to you everything that has transpired! But even in the time since then, 
I have always thought of you, and worried for you, and kept my love&#151;yea, 
even for this place, though dull it may be!

Mom and Dad: Izule...

Izule/Olivia: I am...home...

Izule/Olivia Narrating: Was I truly home, or was even this another 
world, another dream? To this day, I do not know. But I knew I was back, 
of this I was certain, though now I have many things to sort out. Where 
exactly did I go? What had happened to me? Why did I still have that 
armor, and the glow of the God of Wind and Rain? A slew of queries 
awaited me from everybody, it seemed, for every time I turned round.

No one said coming home would be easy, or even asked if I wanted to. I&#39;m 
fairly sure I was better off fighting monsters and adventuring with my 
friends than sitting drinking tea with the old ladies of the town that 
run the rumor mill. But could I go back? Is it possible? Would I dare 
leave home again, for the beloved place my heart yearns for? I began to 
grow nostalgic, and even though I was in my land of birth, I longed for 
the one place I had truly, honestly called home. Queen Jane, old Bert, 
the God of Wind and Rain...all of my friends, I missed them. Perhaps I 
would indeed meet them again, in some far-off fancy, where my dreams 
intercede with the waking world.

Or perhaps I need only to venture into those woods again, where my 
adventures began. Maybe all I need to do is open the door&#151;and I would be 
free.

(Izule walks through the forest in her villager clothes, and the scene 
fades black. In the far distance, she sees a ghostly image of Queen Jane 
running towards her, and she takes off as the lights fade. They nearly 
touch as the curtains draw closed)
