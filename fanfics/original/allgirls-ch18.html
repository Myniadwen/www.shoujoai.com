<h1>All Girls School (part 18 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/allgirls-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>&quot;Furious Treachery&quot;

Alexandra Blair noticed changes in her supposed-lover&#39;s fa&ccedil;ade well 
before many of the girl&#39;s friends did. Ivory Tran&#151;who had seduced the 
poor Furious Hail without trying very hard&#151;was paying less and less 
attention to her and seemed more and more distant whenever they were 
together. When they had sexual intercourse&#151;which still happened, just 
more infrequently&#151;Ivory just didn&#39;t seem as into it as she used to. She 
was still good in bed, but &quot;Haley&quot; had to do most of the work. Ivory&#39;s 
two-colored eyes always seemed fixed on some other thing, like she was 
looking in another world. Whenever Hail asked her what was wrong, Tran 
just gave a lopsided smile, shrugged, and (even in public) pinched her 
body somewhere intimate.

Something was going on, and she was going to find out. As a matter of 
fact, Hail spent an unusual amount of time and energy digging things up 
and talking to people, people she never would&#39;ve been near to otherwise. 
She had very few friends (being transferred the previous year from her 
former school didn&#39;t help that), and those that did call her friend did 
so tentatively. Hero Love seemed to be the closest thing she had to a 
real friend, probably because the girl was both fearless and a raver.

&quot;I don&#39;t look in that direction,&quot; Hero had told her one foggy day after 
school, referring to butting into Ivory&#39;s business. &quot;Frankly, I only 
know her by reputation. Both you and here were sort of transferred here 
last year because you got expelled from your old school. I don&#39;t know 
what kinda trouble either of you got in, and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re not doing 
the same here, but that&#39;s all I know of her.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you share any classes together?&quot;

&quot;Um, P.E. and Math is all. Oh, she used to ogle Miss Cerio in math if 
that helps, but lately they&#39;ve been all platonic.&quot; Hail made a face and 
shrugged mutely. Ivory had told her about how she and her math teacher 
had been lovers for a very brief time, so it wasn&#39;t surprising. She had 
gotten to know about Tran&#39;s lechery yet still clung to her like a 
barnacle to a suicidal whale.

&quot;She&#39;s not giving eyes to Leena, I can say that,&quot; she stated eventually. 
&quot;I mean, yeah, at the very start, but that didn&#39;t last long once she saw 
how she warmed up to that pussy Parkin. She stays after class to go to 
that stupid karate thing, so I don&#39;t think she&#39;s after any of the women 
that don&#39;t go there. If she were, she&#39;d shower with them.&quot; Hail had said 
that last part a bit sadly, for she was among those girls, and had never 
seen Ivory washing up with everyone else. Her own words were condemning 
her; she was beginning to really believe that Ivory Tran cared little 
for her outside of sex.

&quot;So somebody in that class,&quot; said Hero thoughtfully. &quot;Is it just girls 
from P.E., or from the whole school that go there, to the kendo class?&quot;

&quot;How should I know? I&#39;d guess the whole school.&quot;

&quot;So that doesn&#39;t narrow it down. Hey... my home.&quot; Hail looked up and saw 
Hero&#39;s home, a beautiful two-story house with an ample yard on both 
sides and beautiful trees that always seemed in bloom. Her neighborhood 
was very pretty and not too fancy, and looked especially good in spring 
when everything turned pink and white. It disgusted Hail, who was 
bitterly jealous of such beauty. To call her home a sty would be 
praising it.

&quot;You comin&#39; to the club tonight?&quot; asked Hail as her friend walked away.

&quot;Uh, no. Family night.&quot;

&quot;Sucks to be you,&quot; growled the Furious one, even though she desperately 
wished her family was... No, it wouldn&#39;t do her any good to wish. Hero 
was one of the lucky ones, born into a full nuclear family where 
everybody loved everybody&#151;even if their daughter was a wild child. Hero 
(thought Hail, as her friend vanished behind her front door) was like a 
happier, more wholesome reflection of herself: they were both into that 
rave scene and dressed and acted accordingly, but Love kept herself pure 
and impish, and went to those places solely for fun and excitement; Hail 
went to get away from everything. She hated Hero for having such a good 
life yet she was the closest thing to a real friend.

............

Alexandra Blair discovered the truth on Monday. It was a muggy, chilled 
day, and the sky looked like a very sick version of itself. The world 
seemed especially cold and lifeless that morning, and even the brightest 
colors looked ill. Hail didn&#39;t believe that the day&#39;s weather ever 
affected circumstances, but that day her belief was challenged. The 
discovery came in the only class she both loved and did well in: Janet 
Keys&#39; Art class. Keys liked Hail and encouraged her work, even though 
most of the time she produced very dark, disturbing pieces. Apparently, 
Keys appreciated anything as long as it was &quot;true&quot; to the artist, or if 
it came &quot;from&quot; them, as she called it. Hail genuinely worked in that 
class and were it not for her love of it (and to an extension, Keys 
herself), even her father&#39;s badgering couldn&#39;t force her to go.

Hail was in the middle of designing a pitcher in class&#151;that is, the 
entire cycle of making the pitcher itself was in its middle stage. She 
had wanted to make a pure-white one so she could paint blood stripes and 
painful faces on it; she would put dead flowers in it and hang it by its 
handle in her room. Most other students did not choose to make something 
so grotesque, of course, but some came very near it.

While she was shaping the pitcher (getting her hands pretty filthy), 
Hail noticed that Ivory&#39;s best friend, Farrah Kwong, was talking 
thoroughly with the quiet brunette Ancelin. Hail recognized Ancelin 
because she had her in gym class; she knew Farrah was Ivory&#39;s friend 
because she had both researched it and had been introduced once. How 
Farrah and Ancelin knew each other was a mystery at first.

&quot;I know what they&#39;re up to,&quot; hissed a voice to her left. It was Ana, a 
person so bubbly and spirited that her very presence made Hail sick all 
over. People like that should not have existed; they were too 
unrealistic, she believed. Now she was murmuring gossip to Rai, the poor 
creative loner who was unfortunately Ana&#39;s girlfriend (by choice or no, 
Hail had no idea).

&quot;Don&#39;t care,&quot; came Rai&#39;s reply. Hail liked her and thought she would&#39;ve 
made a good friend, and if both she and Zanders had been 
unattached&#151;well, maybe just Zanders&#151;she would&#39;ve probably liked to be 
the girl&#39;s lover.

&quot;It&#39;s very interesting news,&quot; hissed Ana again, but Rai didn&#39;t seem 
moved. &quot;Word is that she&#39;s trying to hook Annie up with her friend. She 
knows very well how much her friend obsesses over that girl; she&#39;s going 
to say as many good things as possible.&quot;

&quot;Again, I don&#39;t care.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t gossip?&quot;

&quot;No. It&#39;s a waste of time and it&#39;s demeaning, not to mention childish. 
Hold still.&quot;

&quot;That tickles... eep! Ah! Anyway&#151;ow! Um, where was I? Oh, I guess poor 
Annie still has doubts&#151;ow! That tickles!&quot;

&quot;If you&#39;d only stop squirming...&quot; Hail tuned out the rest. Now unless 
there was some grave misunderstanding going around, the &quot;friend of 
Farrah&#39;s&quot; was Ivory Tran. Miss Kwong didn&#39;t seem to have anyone else she 
liked in Stanton, at least not to such a close degree that she would 
bother hooking them up with somebody (and what a friend, indeed, for 
Farrah was fairly intolerant to homosexuality and made it very plain to 
everyone). If Ivory was Farrah&#39;s friend, and if she was trying to hook 
her up with Ancelin&#151;or at least trying to strengthen their relationship 
by saying good things about Ivory&#151;then it was Ancelin who so distracted 
Miss Tran.

It all came together rather quickly, or at least fast enough to warrant 
a pause in the art-making. Hail put off her pitcher and began to scheme, 
and though part of her mind had been tortured by drugs, other parts were 
enhanced by them. It did make sense. Ancelin led the karate class. She 
took a shower once that was over in order to avoid taking two. Ivory 
stayed after class and showered with the kendo girls. And, during brief 
moments in gym class, she seemed happier when she was around Ancelin, 
more so than with any other woman. And that included Furious Hail.

Alexandra Blair was now very furious indeed, but she had learned from 
her violent past and decided not to lash out immediately and destroy 
Ancelin. She decided to go down a much more sinister path and split the 
two would-be lovers from each other in a very crafty, 
Shakespearian-in-magnitude ploy. She had seen it done many times: she 
would keep Ivory close to her, but she would keep Ancelin closer still.

Corona Marcos, formerly absorbed in making a vase, had to wonder why 
Blair was smirking so.

............

Alexandra Blair began her devious plot the next day by sitting next to 
her so-called enemy, Ancelin. In spite of her rough, sometimes cruel 
demeanor, there was really a heart of gold buried somewhere in Hail&#39;s 
ashen soul; she just had to dig enough to find it. Now normally, this 
would be nearly impossible as it was exceedingly difficult for her to 
feel positive about anything, even art class&#151;but she could act, and so 
she put on her most cheerful smile (which was really very attractive) 
and sat next to Ancelin. Farrah had probably concluded her business with 
the taller woman, or else just didn&#39;t feel like associating with her.

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re Ancelin from gym class, right?&quot; Ancelin looked up and 
noticed her: Furious Hail was a little smaller than she, but 
considerably thinner. Years of drug abuse had withered away Hail&#39;s 
once-healthy frame, and countless nights at parties without the sun had 
given her a sullen, pale face with sunken eyes that were nearly dead. 
She wore an A-shirt without bust support, and when she spoke, Ancelin 
could see flashes of her tongue ring. She parted her dark purple hair 
out of her face and kept her smile.

&quot;Um, yes,&quot; replied Ancelin politely. &quot;I recognize you, but I don&#39;t know 
your name. Is it Blair?&quot;

&quot;My friends call me Haley,&quot; she told her, her voice unusually upbeat 
(having few friends, it didn&#39;t matter anyway, but...). Ancelin nodded.

&quot;You can call me Annie if you like. Do you need help on your artwork?&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; laughed &quot;Haley&quot;, &quot;I just wanted to say hi and introduce 
myself. We are in two classes together. Hey, that looks like a good 
jar.&quot;

&quot;This?&quot; Ancelin held up a dull-looking clay jar that had not been 
painted or even baked. She frowned and muttered, &quot;It&#39;s kind of lousy, 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;No, no, looks real earthy. Maybe I can help you with your work.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t need help,&quot; stated the taller girl, sounding more embarrassed 
than offended. Hail laughed and badgered her further.

&quot;You will if you want that thing to look alive.&quot;

&quot;Sorry. You should work on your own. This will be art from my mind; Miss 
Keys said to make it as if it were from your own mind, so how can I make 
anything that&#39;s mine if anybody helps me? Sorry.&quot; Hail frowned and gave 
her some space, but in spite of the way she felt about the other woman, 
she had to be impressed. Well, at least there was a reason Ivory fawned 
over her so much outside of looks.

&quot;All right, all right. Hey look, it&#39;s only Tuesday, but would you like 
to hang out with me sometime? I know a few places we can go and party.&quot;

&quot;Party on a school night? My mom would never allow me.&quot;

&quot;She keep ya on a short leash?&quot; Hail smiled in a very smug way, resting 
her chin on her hand. Ancelin really looked offended this time, and bit 
back.

&quot;No. She just loves me enough to be concerned, and for that matter, I 
like spending time with mon mere.&quot;

&quot;All right, sorry I bothered you,&quot; she sighed, sounding defeated and a 
little hurt. &quot;I just wanna make friends. I don&#39;t have too many here, 
and... well, you seem pretty cool. You&#39;re definitely into that whole 
phys ed thing; that shit&#39;s not for me.&quot; Ancelin loosened up a bit, but 
did not answer. Hail then asked if she was free on the weekend, to which 
she replied she would be busy with her mother again. Hail frowned, 
feeling very foiled. Ivory&#39;s hold on this woman was weak compared to the 
mother, and if things were this rough, then Hail would not have to work 
hard, or at all, to split them. But best to be safe.

&quot;So you dating anybody?&quot; she asked quietly. A smile finally curved onto 
Ancelin&#39;s mouth.

&quot;If it&#39;s what you call dating. I&#39;m not so sure about it. She seems 
nice&#151;her name&#39;s Ivory, and she&#39;s in our gym class&#151;but I&#39;m still not so 
sure. Eventually, when she feels comfortable about it, I&#39;ll have to ask 
her whether the rumors I&#39;ve heard about here are true.&quot;

&quot;What rumors?&quot; asked Hail, even though she already knew. Having slept 
with Tran several times, she knew some of the girl&#39;s secrets, and would 
use them for her own advantage.

&quot;I don&#39;t like to gossip or spread lies,&quot; muttered Ancelin. Then she was 
silent. Hail let the pause float, then she snuck in closer and whispered 
to her &quot;friend&quot; in a low, concerned voice.

&quot;Look, I know what you&#39;re talking about, if you want me to be honest. 
I&#39;ve heard about Ivory too, from the girls in the shower room 
especially. They say she got her bullet wounds&#151;those on her shoulder, I 
think&#151;they say she got em&#39; from a fight. She started beating somebody up 
because she was intoxicated and they fought back. I also heard she 
resisted arrest, and got shot by a cop.&quot;

Ancelin&#39;s silence and face were cold. Now those rumors were obviously 
false&#151;Ivory had done her fair share of fighting, but only one wound was 
from an actual skirmish, and she had not started it. The other...

&quot;The most likely rumor,&quot; resumed Hail once she felt sufficient time had 
passed, &quot;is that she tried killing herself and fucked the whole thing 
up. She lost her nerve, but pulled the trigger by accident and hurt 
herself.&quot; (This was the truth, or as near to it as Hail knew)

&quot;I never knew,&quot; whispered Ancelin at last. &quot;I only noticed them for a 
second in the shower. I thought it would be rude to ask her.&quot;

&quot;And now you know.&quot; She nodded her head, and then, Hail played her trump 
card. &quot;Look, Ancelin&#151;Annie, if I may&#151;I don&#39;t know too much about you, 
but I like you and respect you already. You speak your mind and you love 
your mother. You&#39;re obviously very talented and pretty, and yet smart 
enough to be humble. You and I could be good friends, I think. I&#39;d like 
to look out for you so that you don&#39;t end up with a broken heart.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s sweet,&quot; she replied flatly, &quot;but it&#39;s really not your concern. I 
mean...&quot;

&quot;The rumors only get worse, though,&quot; added Hail as an aside. &quot;Like I 
said, for your protection. And I know these are true, because I&#39;ve known 
several... let&#39;s call them eyewitnesses. Ivory sleeps around, you know.&quot; 
At this, Ancelin&#39;s face changed drastically. She looked as if she had 
swallowed a jagged stone, and the bitter taste of it lingered in her 
mouth and stomach. She was angry for many reasons; she was even angry at 
Furious Hail.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t talk that way!&quot; she snapped.

&quot;Annie, I know it&#39;s true,&quot; she replied patiently&#151;and she did, although 
to be certain, she had to have slept with Tran as well. She knew 
firsthand that their common interest was a bed-traveler, and at best, a 
flirt who was very inconsistent with her choosing. Hail told Ancelin all 
this, saying how she had heard of girls who had been seduced by Tran; 
young girls who had been innocently lured into her bed and stripped of 
their virginity; older women who had been victims of her seduction; even 
women she had raped (unfortunately, only the last was false). Ancelin 
hated every word spoken to her, and for two reasons.

She hated gossip first. But in the back of her mind, she feared it was 
all true. And if it was...

&quot;Just shut up,&quot; she growled, not sounding too calm. &quot;Please leave me 
alone. I don&#39;t want to hear anymore.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just trying to&#151;&quot;

&quot;I said... I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot; Hail backed away further, putting her hands up as defense. 
&quot;But Annie, if you need a friend to come to, you&#39;ve got me. I don&#39;t like 
gossip any more than you do, but I&#39;ve heard way too many bad things 
about Ivory Tran to just let you run after her. Try and reconsider.&quot; 
Ancelin blew out a big gust of steam, which must&#39;ve been a promise to do 
so. Furious Hail gave her a kind smile, went off to be alone, and 
watched as her villainy took effect. In no time, Ancelin would be so 
wrought with anger and suspicion that she would push Ivory away forever. 
Stricken by the loss of her would-be love, Tran would have Furious Hail 
to fall on, and she was more than happy to cushion the blow.

During the rest of the week, a change came over Ivory that was so sudden 
and unexpected that everyone who knew of her noticed. Farrah Kwong saw 
the subtleties of her transformation and stayed with her as a friend; 
Furious Hail came to her, counseled her, and stayed with her as a lover. 
Ivory appeared more despondent and stricken than any other time in her 
life, even when she had attempted suicide. Hail tried loving her and 
erasing the grief, but even in the thralls of their lovemaking, she 
could not stop Ivory from thinking. It just wasn&#39;t in her anymore&#151;all 
those desires were gone. She appeared vague and hollow even in the 
aftermath of the sweetest, roughest sex. When she slept with Hail 
clinging to her, she could not dream and did not want to wake again.

Those two bullet scars might as well have been relocated to her heart.

Of course, this only made Hail hate Ancelin even more&#151;and by the coming 
of the next week, it only fueled Ivory&#39;s longing and lust for her. She 
went to great measures, mostly extreme, to win the girl&#39;s heart back, 
and to find out just how she had learned of her deepest, darkest 
secrets. Needless to say, all of Stanton would soon become fully aware 
of Tran&#39;s unrequited love for poor Ancelin Yi, and would ask 
Headmistress Marbel why on Earth she went through the trouble of 
admitting her. Marbel, for a change, could not say anything, except that 
love made people do very stupid things.</pre>
