1:40 pm

 

&quot;Excuse me. Pardon me, please. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hello, Rosewood.&quot;

&quot;You made it!&quot; Stacie exclaimed, somewhat surprised to see the Chairman 
sitting next to her. &quot;Is the fencing meet over already?&quot;

&quot;No, I just left at intermission. It should begin again in thirty 
minutes or so- enough time for me to watch the outcome of this game.&quot;

&quot;Football has two forty-five minute halves, Fitzgerald,&quot; she reminded 
him delicately. He crossed his arms and stared at her numbly.

&quot;I know. I meant what I said.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; She averted her eyes and folded her hands anxiously, fearing 
that he was right to make that assumption. Carnegie had improved since 
their last game, and it was clear they were fighting with all their 
heart- but that just showed how superior Lovelace was. To go up against 
all that, and score twice in the first half... This had been 
Fitzgerald&#39;s plan all along. He deliberately arranged for an average 
team to play against them first, to get Carnegie&#39;s hopes up, then dashed 
them against the rocks of reality with Anolis. Now came the decisive 
blow, indisputable proof that the team should be dissolved and the 
program scrapped. Lovelace would be the end of a dream- and yet Stacie 
kept her focus, determined to watch even if everything she had worked 
for burned before her eyes.

&quot;You&#39;re certain to see the outcome before you have to leave,&quot; she added 
after a long pause. She then faced him and smiled hopefully. &quot;Though you 
had better prepare for a surprise. The game is not over yet.&quot;

 

And people dream dreams that transcend time

Held in the arms of a still sea

As they looked up at the birds and clouds

It set their ephemeral souls on fire on a thousand mornings

I bet they&#39;re taking flight to where the light is headed

Now is the time to launch your dreams

Off into the frontier that is carrying boundless dreams

Farther and farther, dive in the sky

 

&quot;Dies Fatali, Part 2&quot;

 

&quot;Well, ladies and gentlemen, it&#39;s the second half of the game, and both 
teams look ready to wrap this up. Carnegie has been going at it tooth 
and nail, despite vastly overwhelming odds, and special praise have to 
go to their goalie Valencia Durante, who has weathered the storm 
magnificently, stopping all but two of Lovelace&#39;s attacks. Due to a 
minor head injury, she&#39;s been replaced by Lauren Ofdensen. Also being 
replaced is Elisa Berkeley, due to exhaustion. Stepping up for her is 
Alice Hawthorne. Let&#39;s hope these new players can bring some life back 
into the game. No exchanges have been made for Lovelace&#39;s team.

&quot;The ball is set...Lovelace gets an early lead. Hawthorne tries to 
intercept Zanders, but Tran-Yi&#39;s at her heels. Zanders 
passes...Hawthorne blocks, kicks back to Lacroix...Tran-Yi takes over 
and shoots it to- holy cow, Andre stops the ball and drives it fast down 
the field! She&#39;s going through Nanahara... That Hawaiian hell-raiser 
played solid all last year and was nominated MVP, but maybe now she&#39;s 
met her match. Whoops- here comes Nguyen, too, along with Khovansky. 
Those two have been dragging their heels for most of this game, but now- 
whoa! It&#39;s a trifecta of speed, aggression, and pure skill! They&#39;re 
moving like a whirlwind- Andre to Nguyen, Nguyen to Khovansky, Khovansky 
back to Andre- wait, Fox and Miklos look like they&#39;ve figured things 
out, and- no, back to Khovansky, she drives it hard, fakes a shot, sends 
it back to Andre, Andre holds, vaults it over to Nguyen, Nguyen 
shoots...no, that was a fake! Lovelace&#39;s defense is scattered! Andre has 
it now, and...I DON&#39;T BELIEVE IT!! Carnegie scores! Not even five 
minutes into the second half and they&#39;re finally up by one! It&#39;s just 
like the opening act of their last game! Somebody should have done their 
homework!&quot;

&quot;WAAAHH-OOH!! GO JENNIFER!!!&quot; A third of the spectators heard Robin 
Granveldt screaming her lungs out; she leaped out of her chair and waved 
her arms wildly. Gardenia and Odessa winced as they unplugged their 
ears.

&quot;Damn, girl! You wagering on her or something?&quot;

&quot;Sort of,&quot; she replied, smiling and blushing a little. Gardenia laughed 
as she sat back down.

&quot;I guess now you have to do something special with her.&quot;

&quot;I guess I do,&quot; she nodded.

&quot;Wasn&#39;t that only if they won?&quot; Odessa said. Gardenia and Robin gave her 
a disquieting stare, as if the very idea of Carnegie losing was as far 
removed from their minds as celibacy. &quot;Oh, right. Well...I guess that 
means I&#39;m cheering, too. Go Kasumi!!&quot;

&quot;Kick some ass, Felicity! Show them what a Russian fireball can do, 
Nadia!&quot; Nadia briefly looked up and waved; Alice, on the other hand, 
wished that someone would cheer for her. But perhaps all she needed to 
do was prove herself. As Lovelace took the ball and decided to put the 
final nail in Carnegie&#39;s coffin, Hawthorne soared after them like a 
hornet, putting Blake Baum in her sights. She fought to steal the ball 
away and return it to her side, but Alice was a novice at best, while 
Baum had been a star since grade school. She was hopelessly outmatched, 
but her na&iuml;vet&eacute; was her saving grace: she didn&#39;t know she had no chance. 
Blake got through her easily but now had to contend with Amy, Shannon, 
and Fleur, who had ran up to intercept while Hawthorne kept her busy.

&quot;Wonderful distraction tactic!&quot; Leena smiled. &quot;If she keeps this up, 
Lovelace won&#39;t know what&#39;s what. Maybe there&#39;s some hope for that gangly 
loner yet.&quot;

&quot;I still say you should&#39;ve kept Elisa,&quot; Arina muttered. She was having 
her period, now of all times, and was in no condition to play, or to 
complain. Elisa was hunched over, her face pale and wet, her chest 
heaving, her limbs shaking. She had vomited a little but looked better 
now.

&quot;I had no choice,&quot; Leena grumbled. &quot;Alice may be a novice, but she&#39;s the 
best we have right now- unless you&#39;d like to volunteer.&quot;

&quot;No thank you,&quot; she snapped. Arina tried not to concentrate on her 
womanly pains as she watched the game unfold. Carnegie was paying for 
its aggression, as Lovelace started to hammer them with every attack 
imaginable. Ayanna Montgomery only had Elisa&#39;s level of skill, but she 
also bore Fausta&#39;s confidence, and that can sometimes make up for 
mediocrity. She wasn&#39;t aggressive, but rather directed her teammates to 
close their defensive perimeter, honing in on an offensive as it came, 
surrounding them and recovering the ball. Leena had been right to say 
that Rozalia Miklos and Janine Bautista would be a surprise: they were 
both solid players, one nimble and quick while the other was strong and 
steady. Terra thought she could recognize several video-game inspired 
moves in Rozalia&#39;s play: she jumped and swerved with unorthodox skill. 
Bautista had been a cheerleader before she converted to soccer; this was 
evident as she dribbled the ball through Carnegie&#39;s defense and made a 
strong shot.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, pussy got your tongue?&quot; Ivory taunted. She shamelessly 
grinned at Kasumi, Amy, and Shannon, the latter losing her temper and 
spoiling a good play. Tran-Yi took advantage of this and easily slipped 
deep into Carnegie territory, where she mocked Threal again before 
attempting yet another goal. Kula Nanahara was all about speed and 
power. She had no finesse and little skill, but she could cross the 
field faster than anybody, and she made aggression look like an art 
form; even Fausta was impressed. Of course, Carnegie tried to take 
matters into their own hands throughout the game, sending their 
hard-hitters into Lovelace&#39;s defenses and keeping a thick net around 
their own. Terra and Amy easily outmatched Erica Fox in strength, as 
Leena had said they would, but she had far more skill and outmaneuvered 
them to recover the offensive. More often than not, Blake Baum stayed 
behind to guard her goal, guiding her team like a wartime strategist- 
not that Rochelle Klein needed it. She was as flashy as Lauren but 
effective as Valencia, and even when she got a bloody lip and a scraped 
knee, she just laughed it off and begged for more. Raisa Zanders didn&#39;t 
let her looks get in the way either: she could be just as rough and 
nearly gave her team another goal.

&quot;Yet another save by Ofdensen. One has to wonder how this team is 
holding up after an attack of that magnitude, yet Carnegie still stands. 
Lovelace is finally playing the game seriously, using a battle of 
attrition to wear down their opponents&#39; vitality and suck their morale 
dry. Baum, Zanders, and Tran-Yi barrel down the field to finish the game 
once and for all. With only fifteen minutes left, it looks as though 
Carnegie might have to burn out rather than fade away. Velur and Beckett 
stand against the tide...Beckett takes it and braves the gauntlet- no, 
she&#39;s taken down by Fox! Fox takes the ball and sends it waaaay down the 
field to Tran-Yi. Tran-Yi has it, she shoots...intercepted by Threal! I 
doubt she&#39;ll fall victim to Tran-Yi&#39;s charms again! Threal&#39;s taking it 
down- no, now Baum takes possession and passes to Tran-Yi again. Another 
shot...Nazario takes it! Zanders is coming for Nazario and it looks like 
a showdown of wills. Tennis fans will remember that Zanders defeated 
Nazario once, so you&#39;ve got to wonder if lightning will strike twice.

&quot;Nazario hesitates- that&#39;s something you don&#39;t see every day- she punts, 
it looks like an easy save for Zanders- holy cow, there&#39;s Nguyen! 
Where&#39;d she come from!? She takes it away from home side down to...Lord 
almighty, that woman&#39;s fast! Wow, look at her go! Nanahara&#39;s coming 
after her- she can&#39;t keep up! Kula Nanahara can&#39;t keep up! Has Hell 
frozen over? Now Khovansky&#39;s running alongside...Velur&#39;s come back and 
Beckett&#39;s going along with it. Fox and Miklos are headed there too- and 
she just keeps going! Nguyen kicks the ball right into the air, dances 
around her opponents, and catches it again, beautiful play by- no, here 
comes Montgomery! She&#39;s all that&#39;s left now! Nanahara and Tran-Yi are 
moving out, but they could be too late! Andre and Hawthorne close in the 
net, Nguyen&#39;s wide open- Montgomery intercepts- Miklos has the ball- 
Nguyen takes it back! She fakes a shot...Baum&#39;s caught up with her! She 
sweeps in to regain control...no, Nguyen slides! BAM!!! That&#39;s how it&#39;s 
done, ladies and gentlemen!! I never thought I&#39;d see such a ferocious 
play in a practice game! A no-name university has just given Lovelace 
Academy the ride of its life, and now the score is tied, 2-2.

&quot;Uh-oh, it looks like that last play took something out of Nguyen. She&#39;s 
limping along and...yes, Coach Parkin-Katajisto called a time-out. Let&#39;s 
hope that Nguyen is all right, and that Carnegie has a spare. They only 
need to hold tight for seven minutes before they go into penalty kicks. 
This is the last switch they can make, so let&#39;s hope it&#39;s a good one.&quot;

 

- Lauren Ofdensen, Favorite color: red; goalie/reserve-

 

Stacie Rosewood took a deep, cleansing breath, rubbing her face as the 
excitement gradually wore down. What a game this was turning out to be! 
She had always believed that her little idea had potential, but to go up 
against two of the nation&#39;s finest teams, with only a month to prepare, 
and to score twice both times... It was nothing short of remarkable. 
That the future of their career now hung by a single number and seven 
nail-biting minutes, against all hope and odds, was proof that they at 
least deserved recognition, if not reward. Her doubts had been satisfied 
long ago, but Fitzgerald required more concrete proof. He sat stoically 
as the teams rested and huddled around their respective coaches, his 
arms crossed and his eyes hard and cold as crystals.

She checked the pocket-watch her late husband had given her on their 
first anniversary, noting the time. &quot;I say, Helmuth,&quot; she called, 
&quot;oughtn&#39;t you be getting back to the regionals now? Thirty minutes have 
passed.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll do fine without me,&quot; he murmured. &quot;I&#39;m a man of my word, 
Rosewood. I said I would stay until I saw the outcome, and so far, a 
winner has not been decided. I don&#39;t mind the delay. There were some 
unexpected developments.&quot;

&quot;There certainly were,&quot; she agreed, genuinely impressed. Lauren had 
shaken her from polite indifference the most: she had gone from an 
apathetic clown to a serious, dedicated team player in a month&#39;s time. 
Warren&#39;s recommendation of her was paying off; Rosewood was glad she 
took that chance. One day, she would have to get to know the rest of 
these young women better. Perhaps if they won...

No. Not if. When.

&quot;Tell me,&quot; she said softly, &quot;do you think they will win?&quot; Fitzgerald 
leaned back, grunting, uncrossing his arms and stretching his neck. He 
put his personal feelings for the game aside and gave a more unbiased 
opinion.

&quot;It all depends on the goalkeeper&#39;s skill. Whoever they choose to 
substitute for that injured player will not matter. It would take 
someone of considerable talent to put Carnegie in the lead before the 
end of the game, and I do not think they have anyone of that caliber 
available- or if they do, they do not possess the strength to accomplish 
it. This is a game of stamina, is it not, and from what I have seen, 
your ladies have spent all but their last drop. To answer your question, 
then, I honestly do not think they will be able to win. The goalkeeper 
will not endure very many penalty kicks.&quot; Rosewood nodded quietly; she 
was glad she could count on his studies. Leave it to Fitzgerald to never 
rely on hope, only observation and facts. He was mathematical and 
precise, like a machine, and spoke not out of spite but honest 
examination.

&quot;I have faith,&quot; she replied. &quot;Arthur Warren recommended that goalie by 
name. I even interviewed her personally. She has incredible potential, 
if she has but the will to harness it.&quot;

&quot;All that&#39;s required, then, is the will.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll find it,&quot; she smiled, &quot;though I could never bring myself to tell 
her. I would lose face.&quot; She smirked at him, and the faintest trace of a 
smile formed on his pursed lips.

 

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Leena asked. Amy nodded and gingerly sat down next 
to Elisa.

&quot;I th-th-think I j-just pulled a m-m-muscle.&quot;

&quot;Get some rest, you&#39;ve earned it. Okay, you&#39;re all doing good. Actually, 
you&#39;re playing magnificently. Andre, I&#39;m not sure what was going through 
your head back there, but it certainly impressed me. And Nguyen...&quot; The 
wounded woman looked up at her as Fleur tended to her leg. &quot;Thank you. 
Your sacrifice won&#39;t be in vain. Thanks to you, we only need to score 
one more goal.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...but there&#39;s just one problem with that, Coach,&quot; Lauren grunted. 
&quot;Who&#39;re you gonna get to fill in for Amy? Val and Leese&#39;re still out of 
it, and Arina...well, let&#39;s not go there.&quot;

&quot;Yes please,&quot; Essylt grunted. Leena sighed deeply as she massaged her 
forehead. If only Kathlyn were here... She only needed one more player, 
but all her spares were disabled. Elisa was still shaking, Valencia and 
Amy had injuries to consider, Arina had cramps, and Freya was far too 
frail. Every one of her hopes was just as bleak as the next...unless 
Leena was willing to take a risk and put somebody in anyway. She would 
have to be very desperate in that case. She knew that if she took this 
final option, the chances of Lovelace scoring again would be incredibly 
high. Even if they didn&#39;t, Leena was certain Lauren wouldn&#39;t hold up 
against Lovelace&#39;s attack for long. She didn&#39;t say it, but Leena could 
tell her reserve goalie was fatigued. Oh, what to do...

&quot;We have no choice,&quot; she announced. She wouldn&#39;t put an injured person 
on the field, but there was one person on their team who could at least 
walk in a straight line. &quot;Essylt, you&#39;ll have to do.&quot;

&quot;I am not feeling well,&quot; she snarled, gnashing her teeth.

&quot;But you can walk, right? I don&#39;t expect you to run or anything. Just 
stand there and hit the ball if it comes your way. We&#39;ll have to stall 
them until the game ends. Beckett, Velur, I&#39;m counting on you two to 
save our hides. Ofdensen, whatever tricks you have, now&#39;s the time to 
pull them out. I know you&#39;re tired, but hang in there. The rest of you, 
start praying. It&#39;s do or die.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the worst plan I&#39;ve ever heard!!&quot;

The voice that called out to them was both alien and startlingly 
familiar. It did not belong to a member of the team, for it was full of 
energy, hope, and joy- but mostly joy, glowing out of her body as she 
approached the player&#39;s box, standing tall and triumphant with a smile 
of utmost conviction, and perhaps even arrogance, on her face. Her dark 
blonde hair flapped in the wind and her outfit, the colors of a Carnegie 
University soccer player, shined gloriously in the sunlight, making her 
look more like a Valkyrie than a woman. Everyone stood gaping, except 
for Leena, as she walked towards them as if she owned the very world.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late,&quot; she grinned.

Rain Howlet.

 

- Terra Tu, Favorite color: black and orange; left back-

 

Helmuth Fitzgerald saw her immediately, and sat bolt upright, like a 
telephone pole. He was clearly shocked, but this was not the comical 
expression a normal person would make- no hanging mouth, bulging eyes, 
or embarrassing squeal. His eyes were quivering and aflame with sheer 
horror and disbelief; his mouth was shut tight, so firm that his lips 
and teeth could have bitten through a rock; and his fists were curled so 
fiercely that his knuckles turned white. This was surprise as only a 
restrained person could express it, without fire or stupefying 
amazement. He sat there with his eyes fixed on his prodigal student for 
nearly a full minute before directing his frosty rage elsewhere.

&quot;Rosewood, what is the meaning of this?&quot; he snarled. His voice was 
almost a whisper, but there was no mistaking the anger. Most people 
raise their voices when they get angry; Fitzgerald lowered his. You knew 
that when he glared at you with arctic eyes and spoke so quietly you 
could barely hear him that he was truly furious.

&quot;The meaning of what?&quot; she replied.

&quot;Don&#39;t be coy with me, Anastasia. You know perfectly well what I am 
referring to.&quot; You also knew Fitzgerald was angry when he addressed you 
by name, something he only did amongst family. He indicated the soccer 
field with a cold nod. &quot;You have been conspiring with my student and 
convinced her to join this team. Through some duplicity or another, 
you&#39;ve brainwashed her and swayed her against me. I will not tolerate 
this, Anastasia: I&#39;ll see to it that this team is dissolved instantly. 
How dare you interfere with my business like this?&quot;

&quot;Helmuth, what are you talking about?&quot; she balked. Rosewood looked 
honestly stunned and even a little insulted. &quot;Is that one of your 
students? I really did not know. I assure you, I&#39;ve never even seen her; 
I probably don&#39;t even know her name. I certainly didn&#39;t have any idea 
that she had an interest in this team. And what&#39;s this about me 
conspiring against you? Do you really think I have that much time on my 
hands? You know I respect you and your fencing school- why on Earth 
would I disrupt it?&quot; She spoke so clearly and with such innocence that 
Fitzgerald&#39;s fury perished almost entirely. His face became deathly pale 
as he looked from Rain, to Rosewood, then back again.

&quot;You really had nothing to do with it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she said simply. Now his mouth hung open, and he deflated in 
defeat.

&quot;You really didn&#39;t do anything...&quot; Rosewood stared at her rival 
sympathetically, then focused her attention on the game. She had been 
telling the truth: she had nothing to do with this sudden change. 
But...now that this girl was here...

Good luck, young woman. I hope you know what you&#39;re doing.

 

While all of this was taking place in the bleachers above (like so many 
gods quarreling over the affairs of mortals), the team was still reeling 
over Rain&#39;s sudden appearance- all, that is, except for Leena, who 
smiled as if she had been expecting her.

&quot;Glad you could make it, Howlet. You look like you&#39;re ready for some 
action.&quot;

&quot;You bet!&quot; she announced. Fleur looked more confused than any of them; 
Alice looked the most relieved.

&quot;Just what are you doing here?&quot; Rain looked at them all- sixteen 
beautiful women waiting for a catalyst to change their fortunes- took a 
deep breath, and sealed her fate.

&quot;I came to play soccer!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m happy to hear it,&quot; Leena smiled. &quot;You&#39;ll be taking Amy&#39;s place.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t do that!&quot; Fausta exclaimed. &quot;Coach, you know full well that 
you can&#39;t let someone who&#39;s not on the team play in our game! It&#39;s 
against the rules!&quot;

&quot;I know the rules,&quot; she replied casually. &quot;You should really get more 
involved, Miss Nazario. Didn&#39;t you know? Miss Howlet&#39;s been with us for 
weeks.&quot; She smirked and revealed her clipboard with all the players&#39; 
names, addresses, and contact information. At the very bottom was none 
other than Rain Howlet&#39;s. &quot;I decided to secretly add her after watching 
her practice a couple of times. You know- as a contingency.&quot;

&quot;You magnificent bastard,&quot; she murmured, appalled and impressed by 
Leena&#39;s craftiness. &quot;So you were planning this?&quot;

&quot;No...just hoping. I registered her as a bench-warmer just in case she 
ever had a change of heart. I hope that&#39;s okay.&quot; Rain smiled and nodded 
her head. If Fitzgerald could be underhanded, why not the coach? 
&quot;Anyway, we&#39;ve got seven minutes left and the score&#39;s tied, Miss Howlet. 
We won&#39;t be able to survive if we go into penalty kicks. Do you think 
you can tip the scales in our favor?&quot;

&quot;Who do you think you&#39;re talking to?!&quot; she exclaimed proudly. &quot;I&#39;ll have 
it done in five! Just stand back and watch!&quot;

&quot;This is a team sport, Rain,&quot; Fleur reminded her tartly. &quot;Don&#39;t let your 
head get so big that you lose balance!&quot; She then tapped Amy&#39;s leg and 
gave her a sour smile. Fleur was taking a medical major, so she was the 
obvious choice to handle injuries. &quot;You should be okay soon. I suppose 
we&#39;re even now.&quot;

&quot;Y-yeah.&quot; She grinned at Fleur, apparently unaware of her destructive 
personality, and watched as she and the others returned to the game, a 
new player in the fold. She had to wonder how Fitzgerald was taking 
this.

&quot;It looks like Carnegie is ready for its last stand,&quot; the announcer 
stated. &quot;They&#39;ve become accustomed to putting on a brave face in the 
middle of adversity. It happened in their game against Anolis and it&#39;s 
happening now. Uh...I&#39;ve just been told that the coach replaced Nguyen 
with one Rain Howlet, a relative newcomer. She&#39;s never been to any of 
the games, but she&#39;s officially listed, so the ref&#39;s going to permit it. 
Maybe she&#39;s Parkin-Katajisto&#39;s &#39;trump card&#39; that&#39;s been hiding for such 
an occasion. Let&#39;s hope she&#39;s up to the task.&quot;

&quot;So, it seems you were right,&quot; Rosewood murmured. She glanced at 
Fitzgerald, but he was like a rock, solid and impenetrable, so focused 
on the game that he didn&#39;t even move. She couldn&#39;t tell if he was angry 
or simply intent on watching his student. Meanwhile, everyone returned 
to their positions and the game resumed. Lovelace was performing 
aggressively, wanting to close the lid on this game once and for all. If 
only Carnegie had known how truly tired they were, and how impressed 
they were by their rivals&#39; performance, their morale would&#39;ve soared and 
the game would be theirs.

Kula Nanahara drove the ball past Alice and Fleur, but Rain swept in 
before she even knew what was happening, flitting like a hummingbird and 
sprinting down the field. As grass and wind blew past her vision, 
everything slowly became blurred: opponents, the stands, the spectators, 
the goal, and eventually the whole world. Rain didn&#39;t close her eyes, 
but she did slip into a pseudo-fantasy, imagining herself at the fencing 
tournament, in the finals, with the national championship on the line. 
She imagined this because she knew this would be her last chance to 
entertain such a fantasy, that she would never look back once this game 
was over, and that it would be the end of her dream.

The crowd was roaring for her, just for her. She felt the stare of her 
parents, so unnecessary, and her friends, so warm and hopeful. Her 
opponent had that calm, cool glare that was so prevalent among fencers. 
They put their masks over their faces, saluted, and moved into position. 
Rain bent down, accelerating, swerving like a stream, like a dolphin, 
like a gale. She thrust, with fist and leg- the ball bounced, flew, was 
caught- she danced around and took it back, simple as a flick of the 
wrist. Thrust, thrust- octave, prime, septime, then up to the tierce, 
quinte, maybe a quart- all the familiar places. Her opponents were 
unprepared for such a unique strategy.

Now she saw the goal, and the keeper, as clear as clear, but it was not 
Rochelle Klein who stood before it. It was Ancelin Tran-Yi; it was Yuki 
Kagure; it was Fitzgerald; it was her father and mother. Adopted, they 
said. We adopted you when you were two. You&#39;re not our real daughter, 
Rain. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve suspected this for awhile. I&#39;m sorry if this 
surprises you, but...we couldn&#39;t have children, and we wanted to. We 
just had to have something that would represent our love in this world. 
We only want what&#39;s best for you.

&quot;Bullshit!&quot; she exclaimed out loud. &quot;Why did you suffer and sacrifice so 
much for me? Was I really worth all that trouble? Why did you waste so 
much of your time...when I wasn&#39;t even your real daughter!? I never 
asked for any of that! I never got to...do things...my own way! You were 
always there, holding my hand, like I was some defenseless kid! You 
always wanted to fix your little problem! You have no idea how much I 
hated that!&quot;

Howlet lunges...

&quot;You have no idea...&quot;

It looks like a close one!

&quot;No idea...how much...&quot;

This could be it! The national fencing championship title is on the 
line!!

&quot;How much...I&#39;m...grateful.&quot;

Her opponent draws back...

&quot;HEEEEEEEYYYYAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!!!!&quot; And with tears flowing from her eyes, 
the warrior let out a mighty roar, and dealt the final blow of the final 
battle of the final war. The very Earth seemed to shake as the crowd 
yelled and the announcer screamed.

Goal. With two minutes to spare.

The rest of the game felt like it was going in slow motion. Rochelle 
Klein somberly returned the ball to her teammates and watched helplessly 
as they mounted a futile attack. Leena screamed for them not to let 
their guard down. Nadia was giddy as she ran to intercept Ivory. Terra 
felt wobbly as she blocked Raisa&#39;s kick and blasted it down to Kasumi. 
Shannon knelt on the ground, weeping and laughing, kissing the beautiful 
green turf for joy as the seconds drained from the clock. Kasumi took 
the ball to Felicity, who was beaming. Lauren was cheering. Freya drew 
everyone on the benches together for a big hug. Alice laughed and pumped 
her fists. Fleur crossed the field, smirking, and passed the ball to 
Rain, who offered one final, useless shot at the goal before turning 
around jumping in the air. And all this time, the crowd was cheering 
their name.

&quot;Car-ne-gie! Car-ne-gie! Car-ne-gie! Car-ne-gie!&quot;

&quot;WE DID IT!!!&quot; The entire team rushed out onto the field, regardless of 
their weariness and injuries: hugging, jumping, yelling, clapping, 
kissing, and lifting people into the air: first Leena, who yelped and 
squealed, then Rain, who could not remember a happier moment. This was 
everything she had desired come to life- not merely victory and glory, 
but companionship and love as well. If only her parents had been there 
to see her. The team from Lovelace also came out, weary but full of joy, 
which is more subtle and heavenly than happiness. It is that feeling you 
get even when you don&#39;t win, even when you&#39;re apart from those you love, 
even when (in some cases) you are about to die peacefully. It is not 
happiness; it is the superior emotion, a quieter and more fulfilling 
sensation that brings perfect contentment no matter what the situation.

&quot;Leena!&quot; Blake called. She was lowered from her lofty position and faced 
her former students with a smile. &quot;Congratulations! You played one hell 
of a game!&quot;

&quot;Thanks! You were all wonderful! You&#39;ve surpassed all my hopes and 
expectations. It was a terrific game.&quot;

&quot;It was, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;So we&#39;re a real team now, right?&quot; squealed Freya as she hugged Leena 
from behind. The others looked puzzled, so she briefly explained the 
arrangement Fitzgerald and Rosewood made.

&quot;Is that right?&quot; Ivory beamed. &quot;Well then, I&#39;m glad you guys won! You 
deserve to be a real team! Maybe we&#39;ll run into each other again 
sometime- only then it&#39;ll be an official game, and I&#39;ll be sure to whip 
your asses from here to the moon!&quot;

&quot;Whatever you say,&quot; Raisa grumbled warmly. Meanwhile, in the stands, 
Fitzgerald finally stood up, still a civil and unflinching creature even 
after watching all his plans backfire. He did not suffer in his defeat; 
he merely accepted it, and moved on, undeterred. He had not anticipated 
this...but no matter. A deal was a deal.

&quot;Congratulations, Rosewood,&quot; he said, reaching his hand out in good 
sport. &quot;Both teams have held up their end of the bargain, so I will 
recognize them as official parts of the school.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. I admit that I doubted them for awhile, but not any 
longer. Now the real struggle beings.&quot;

&quot;Indeed. Four years to win the national championship, was it? But if 
they can perform this well, against superior schools, perhaps they do 
have a chance.&quot; His mood mellowed and he removed his glasses to polish 
them. &quot;Tell me, Rosewood, do you know why I suggested this bargain? It 
was not in the hopes that your idea would fail. This school came about 
largely by my labors, fueled by my dreams, and as such, I wouldn&#39;t be 
able to tolerate any element that causes this college embarrassment. I 
was concerned that your...notion of a sports team would do exactly that, 
so I wanted to put them through a test. They have passed. I pray they 
continue to pass, not for our sake but for the school&#39;s. I will not have 
my dream laughed at. If you&#39;ll excuse me.&quot;

&quot;Of course. ...And I understand your line of thinking, Helmuth,&quot; she 
spoke after he was gone. &quot;I understand it very well. It&#39;s one of the 
reasons why I&#39;ve kept you in my company. Well. Now where did Mary and 
Jerry get to?&quot; Fitzgerald had other concerns as he made his way through 
the crowd to the field: attending the remainder of the fencing meet, for 
one, and a certain juvenile delinquent he had an appointment with. He 
patiently waded through the throngs of celebrating people- some 
overwhelmed, others proud, a few disappointed, but most of them very 
happy- until he came to Carnegie&#39;s team, and hovered over them 
ominously. Rain saw him coming and stood nervously before him, feeling 
cold and remorseful. Fitzgerald gazed at her with an unreadable 
expression before closing his eyes.

&quot;So, you have made your decision.&quot; Rain&#39;s mouth hung open for awhile 
before she replied, lowering her head and voice.

&quot;Yes sir.&quot;

&quot;Look at me, Howlet,&quot; he commanded. His face was stern, but only 
because- she believed- he did not want her regretting her choice, 
whatever her reason was for making it. He repeated himself: &quot;Is this 
your decision?&quot;

Now her reply was bold and certain. &quot;Yes, it is, sir.&quot; He stared at her 
again, very intently, perhaps wondering why she would do this to him, 
after everything he had done for her. But if those questions crossed his 
mind, he certainly did not ask them.

&quot;Then return your sword and uniform to my office first thing tomorrow 
morning.&quot;

&quot;...Yes sir.&quot;

&quot;I will return to the match now. I wish you the best, Miss Howlet. Do 
not dare let me down.&quot;

&quot;Yes sir!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You can count on me, sir! I&#39;ll be sure to 
make you proud.&quot;

There was much he wanted to say to her- much that needed to be said, and 
still more she deserved to hear. But Fitzgerald left her quietly, 
without looking back. He could only presume that she would do the same. 
But in the meantime, she had a team celebration to attend to.

And more than a few sexy women to get reacquainted with.

 

- Kasumi Beckett, Favorite color: red, orange, and blue; striker-

 

&quot;Come on, Rain, hurry! We&#39;re going to be late!&quot;

&quot;Just a second!&quot; The tall, dark-haired blonde giggled ravenously as she 
jumped into her shoes, took one more look around the locker room, and 
dashed outside to meet her teammates. Along the wall were several wooden 
nametags lined up, with the names of the players painted on them. She 
couldn&#39;t resist taking one last peek at them before leaving, and felt a 
surge of excitement and fulfillment well up inside her. These were the 
Carnegie all-stars, and now she was one of them.
