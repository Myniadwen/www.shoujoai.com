<h1>In My Heart and In My Mind (part 13 of 28)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Sam found herself surrounded by darkness. She reached out with her mind 
for Star but could not feel the girl&#39;s essence anywhere. It was as if 
the girl&#39;s entire existence had vanished and with it Sam felt a part of 
herself had been violently torn for her. She swam through the blackness, 
frantically in search of the girl, not willing to believe that Star was 
no longer with her. After a time she realized that Star could not hear 
her anymore and a lump began to form inside of her heart, weighing her 
down heavily. 

Slowly Sam began to open her eyes, which felt as if they were made of 
lead, and she groaned as she tried to sit only to collapse back onto the 
bed, clenching at her right eye as red-hot embers flashed through her 
head. She let out a scream of agony as the physical pain, coupled with 
the emotional agony, filled her chest. 

Trish appeared at her side, &quot;Sam? Sam it&#39;s me, Trisha. What happened?&quot; 

Sam&#39;s good eye tiredly searched the room until it came upon Trish&#39;s 
face. &quot;It hurts...&quot; She moaned, clenching tightly to her chest and the 
emptiness the filled her, trying to keep it from swallowing her whole. 
&quot;I... It feels like my head and stomach are on fire...&quot; She said dryly, 
her mouth felt like sandpaper and her throat burned, &quot;I need something 
to drink.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go get a doctor.&quot; Sam heard Diana say and the door to the room 
quickly opening. 

&quot;Here.&quot; Trish held a glass of water with a long bendable straw close to 
Sam&#39;s lips, helping the girl lift her head to take a sip, &quot;Can you tell 
me what happened?&quot; Trish whispered into the girl&#39;s ear. 

&quot;I... I can&#39;t feel her anymore&quot; Sam explained, tears running around her 
head and into her ear, and she buried her face in the pillow as a pained 
sob overcame her.
 
Trish placed the glass back on the table and wrapped her arms around 
Sam&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Shhhh...&quot; She soothed, rubbing the girl&#39;s back as she 
sobbed into the pillow. 

A doctor suddenly rushed into the room with a nurse close beside him, 
&quot;Excuse me miss.&quot; He said politely as he moved Trish out of the way. 

Sam reached out towards her friend, &quot;D... don&#39;t leave me...&quot; She 
pleaded.

The pained look in Sam&#39;s eyes tugged on Trish&#39;s heart and she reached 
out to take the girl&#39;s hand, being sure to stay out of the way of the 
doctor. 

The doctor looked as if he was about to say something to the nurse then 
reconsidered and nodded for the nurse to go to the other side of the 
bed, and then began to examine the girl, &quot;Can you tell us what happened? 
Where does it hurt?&quot; He asked as he shone a light into her eye.

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know.&quot; Sam explained in slow laboured breathes, she was 
finding it hard to breath and her heart kept pounding out of control, 
&quot;It feels like there is a weight on my chest and my head and stomach 
hurt.&quot; She said, moving her hand to her side, still feeling the hot 
blood upon her fingers and running down her hip. 

The doctor moved the girl&#39;s hand, &quot;Where?&quot; He inquired, pulling up her 
gown, &quot;Oh my god...&quot; He breathed as he stared at the girl&#39;s side. 

&quot;Holy hell...&quot; Trish stared in shock, not believing what she saw. 

&quot;What?&quot; Sam looked down at what they were staring at to see a circular 
scar about the size of a nickel, ten or so centimetres to the left of 
her bellybutton. The moment her eyes feel upon the mark she knew what 
had happened to her friend and why she did not respond any longer. Sam 
did not want to believe it, but knew deep inside that the reason Star no 
longer respond was because she was no longer apart of the living world 
and this thought ripped through her heart like the bullets through her 
friend. Suddenly she bulked and curled into a tight ball as a sense of 
loss overwhelmed her and she let out another series of sobs, her hand 
never letting go of Trisha&#39;s. 

The doctor ignored the girl&#39;s display as he took a moment to examine her 
back and made another shocked sound, &quot;There is another one here.&quot; He 
stated in amazement, &quot;A through and through.&quot; He breathed.

&quot;But how?&quot; The nurse asked, as she stroked the girl&#39;s back, trying with 
vain to sooth the girl&#39;s wounded heart.

The doctor leaned in close to the girl, &quot;Samantha?&quot; The doctor said to 
the girl, trying to get her attention, &quot;I need you to stay calm for a 
moment and tell me where else it hurts.&quot; 

Sam uncurled one arm from her stomach pointed above her right eyebrow, 
under the layers of bandages, &quot;H... here.&quot;

With shaky hands the doctor rolled up the edge of the bandage and 
quickly took a step back, &quot;I... I need a second opinion.&quot; He said as he 
ran out the door. 

Trish stared at her friend&#39;s forehead, and breathed in disbelief, &quot;Mom, 
is that what I think it is?&quot; 

Her mother put a hand to her mouth and nodded, &quot;What happened to her?&quot; 
She asked in pained astonishment, &quot;H... how... who... who would shot a 
child?&quot;
