<h1>Tales of Sappho (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/talesappho-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Sappho walked with a purpose towards a vendor of fine Persian silks, 
pointing to several green and yellow shimmering veils as Clara and 
Efterpi watched from a distance. Looking away from the poet as she 
pulled out a leather satchel of gold coins, the young singer turned to 
Clara, &quot;Miss,&quot; she said a bit shyly, &quot;Is... Is she truly Sappho of 
Lesbos?&quot;

&quot;Of course, why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Well... Given her reputation, I would&#39;ve thought she was taller,&quot; 
Efterpi confessed. Clara smirked; it was true, the great poet was two 
finger&#39;s width shorter than the youth and a full hand&#39;s width shorter 
than herself.

&quot;Don&#39;t let her diminutive stature fool you,&quot; Clara whispered back, &quot;A 
giant lives within that small frame.&quot;

After leaving the silk trader, Sappho had Efterpi, who was more familiar 
with the market, lead the way to a seller of perfumery and cosmetics. 
There the poet bought a small clay jar of perfume, eyeliner made of 
ground charcoal and olive oil, as well as a lip colorant of redding and 
lard. The trio then quickly slipped behind a canvassed open tent where 
wine from Melos and Skyros were sold alongside dates and olive oil from 
Lesbos. Behind the tent was a large building, the small space between 
the building and tent sheltered on either side by shrubs.

Once she was sure that they were unobserved, Sappho turned to the two 
women. &quot;Clara,&quot; she said, motioning towards the edge of the tent, &quot;Keep 
lookout. Efterpi,&quot; she said as she now turned to the young brunette, 
&quot;Strip.&quot;

Efterpi suddenly looked nervous, &quot;What?&quot;

Sappho took a deep breath as she put a hand on the youth&#39;s shoulder. &quot;If 
the king&#39;s guards waited for you that night in the garden, then they 
probably know what you look like. We need to disguise you. Now please, 
take those patched up rags off so we can begin.&quot;

Efterpi looked from Sappho to Clara and back, &quot;I don&#39;t have to leave my 
lyre here too, do I?&quot; she asked as she clutched the instrument to her 
breast, &quot;It was a gift of my father. It&#39;s all I have left of him.&quot;

Sappho pursed her lips together in thought. &quot;No,&quot; she eventually 
answered, &quot;But your clothes do have to go.&quot;

Reluctantly, Efterpi took her worn tunic off. Sappho looked upon her 
nude body and sighed heavily, &quot;Oh, if I were but twenty years 
younger...&quot;

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Clara said over her shoulder, adding, &quot;Will you hurry 
up, I&#39;m getting nervous.&quot;

Sappho quickly took the jar of perfume, broke it open by smashing the 
top against the wall of the building, and poured the entire aromatic 
contents over Efterpi&#39;s head and body. The strong odor of lilacs and 
ambrosia caused the young woman&#39;s eyes to water. She then quickly 
applied the eyeliner after an Egyptian fashion, and put the reddened 
lard upon her lips and cheeks. Finally, seeing that the perfume had been 
absorbed into the skin, she had her dress herself in the silks that had 
been purchased for her.

Standing back with her arms crossed and a smug look on her face, Sappho 
admired her accomplishment. Clara, meanwhile, continued her guard duty. 
&quot;Are you two done yet?&quot; she asked as she nervously watched a fruit 
peddler bringing his cart nearby.

&quot;See for yourself.&quot;

Clara turned around and grimaced. &quot;You made her look like a whore!&quot; she 
cried.

&quot;A temple prostitute from Attica I met once around eighteen years ago, 
to be exact,&quot; Sappho responded. Efterpi was about to protest, but the 
poet stopped her by placing a finger to her lips, &quot;The important thing 
is that you no longer look like the street waif you did, so as long as 
you stick with us we should be able to get you into the palace. Now 
come,&quot; she said, taking her staff up once again and, with Clara on one 
side of her and Efterpi on the other, they eventually made their way 
back to the palace.

It was still relatively early in the morning as they approached the 
gates to the royal palace. Even so, the news had still managed to get 
out that Sappho was missing, and thus it was that the guards and King 
Adrastos himself began a frantic search of the royal grounds. Entering 
the room he&#39;d had set aside for the poet from Lesbos, the king began to 
look for clues that may&#39;ve been left behind to tell him where Sappho and 
her companion might be, when he chanced upon something that took his 
breath away.

King Adrastos couldn&#39;t believe his eyes; there, upon a small stand by 
the large cushioned bed, was a papyrus with verse scrolled upon it, a 
bottle of dried ink and a hollow reed pen next to it. Sappho, the 
greatest poet since Homer of the Iliad and the Odyssey, had written a 
new verse, and under his roof! To have one blessed by the gods honor his 
household in such a way was considered good luck, and the king 
approached the new poem like a high priestess of one of the mystery 
religions might approach Demeter&#39;s alter. He delicately picked up the 
work, saw that the title was &quot;An Ode to Clara&#39;s Lips,&quot; and began to 
read.

&quot;My lips hunger,&quot; he read aloud by the flame of a nearby oil lamp, 
noting that the poem was four verses, &quot;For her moist lips, the taste of 
which is sweeter that any honey, and the bouquet more intoxicating 
than...&quot; he stopped, reading the next few lines silently to himself as 
Sappho herself entered the room with Clara and the disguised Efterpi in 
tow.

&quot;King Adrastos,&quot; Sappho said, smirking at the way he nearly jumped out 
of his skin when he realized he was no longer alone, &quot;While I&#39;m 
flattered by your interest in my verse, I do wish you&#39;d wait until I was 
finished with it.&quot;

The king looked at Sappho, then at the papyrus, then at the poet once 
more. &quot;&#39;Clara&#39;s Lips,&#39; this... This isn&#39;t about the lips of her mouth, 
is it?&quot;

Sappho raised an eyebrow as she crossed her arms, &quot;Why King Adrastos, I 
hardly would&#39;ve taken you for a prude.&quot;

Clara went over to the King and tilted his hands so she could read the 
papyrus as well. &quot;&#39;More luscious than a Cyprian grape,&#39; am I? I&#39;m not 
sure whether or not I should be mortified or flattered.&quot;

&quot;Be flattered,&quot; Sappho responded with a wave of her hand, &quot;It looks 
better on you.&quot;

&quot;Sappho,&quot; Adrastos said as he gave the papyrus over to Clara, &quot;There are 
certain protocols of etiquette when under another&#39;s roof, such as 
letting your host know you&#39;re leaving for a bit and... Hello,&quot; he said 
as he now noticed Efterpi standing by the bed holding her lyre, &quot;And who 
is this?&quot; he asked, the young brunette squirming uncomfortably in her 
silks under his gaze.

&quot;A girl I met on the streets,&quot; Sappho answered, &quot;The poor thing was 
thrown out to live on the streets by a cruel stepmother and when I saw 
her on the streets, well, my heart melted, my senses took flight, and 
desiring the child I brought her here.&quot;

&quot;You what?&quot; the king asked in astonishment, &quot;You mean, you and her... 
But I thought you were with her,&quot; he said, motioning to Clara.

&quot;I am,&quot; she said, taking her beloved&#39;s hand in hers, &quot;But she knows I 
cannot be tied down to a single love, don&#39;t you Clara dear?&quot; she asked, 
smiling at her partner.

Clara narrowed her eyes as she smiled back, &quot;Of course, Sappho my love,&quot; 
she answered through gritted teeth, causing the poet to wince as she 
squeezed her hand hard.

&quot;I... I see,&quot; the bewildered king answered, &quot;Still, two lovers, at your 
age?&quot;

Sappho frowned at the king. &quot;I&#39;m only four and fifty, Kind Adrastos. I&#39;m 
old, not dead.&quot; Taking a breath to calm herself after the perceived 
slight, she continued, &quot;Anyways, since I have taken a liking to the fair 
nymph, I wish to bring her back with me to Lesbos when Clara and I leave 
tomorrow with your daughter. So if you could just order a letter of 
transit for her, we...&quot;

&quot;Sappho, I&#39;m sorry but... Please don&#39;t be offended, but I can&#39;t do 
that.&quot;

The elder tilted her head as she scrutinized him, &quot;Can&#39;t help me?&quot;

&quot;Please try to understand,&quot; Adrastos continued, &quot;This isn&#39;t Lesbos, it&#39;s 
Athens, and we have rather unique laws concerning citizenship and who 
can and cannot freely pass back and forth through our borders.&quot;

&quot;Meaning?&quot;

&quot;Meaning that if the father is dead, and the stepmother yet lives, then 
she is still the girl&#39;s legal guardian.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Sappho asked in disbelief, &quot;But it&#39;s the stepmother who kicked 
her out of the home! It&#39;s because of her that the girl lives on the 
streets!&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but the girl is not yet a woman, and even if she were only male 
Athenians are allowed citizenship and legal right to decide a daughter&#39;s 
future. Normally in such a case, the father and the father alone can 
authorize the girl&#39;s exit to Lesbos with you, but as you say the father 
is dead. Therefore, by Athenian law, in his absence the girl becomes the 
property of the stepmother by default. Unless of course she has any 
living male relatives she knows of, such as an uncle or even a brother.&quot;

Sappho turned to Efterpi, who sadly shook her head. &quot;So in order for her 
to leave with us,&quot; the poet said as she turned back to the king, &quot;We 
need the stepmother&#39;s consent, correct?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; King Adrastos said, &quot; Athens is not an absolute monarchy, 
power is shared among the nobles of the Senate and myself, and even I 
cannot forego the laws of the land. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

The poet frowned. It seemed that King Adrastos of Athens was little more 
than a figurehead, and that helping Efterpi would be more difficult than 
she would&#39;ve suspected. &quot;I see,&quot; she said at last.

&quot;Is there anything else I can help you with?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Let your servants know I wish them to bring a tub in here for a 
bath, along with hot water. Also, I plan to go out once more from the 
palace this morning, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;What, again?&quot; Adrastos asked.

&quot;Yes, again. And king,&quot; she said with a smile as she batted her eyes at 
him, &quot;At least I&#39;m letting you know I&#39;m going out this time.&quot;

The king didn&#39;t say a word as he shook his head in exasperation and 
turned to leave. Once the king was safely out of the room, Sappho 
clutched her now sore hand close to her, &quot;Ow! Clara, was it absolutely 
necessary to crush my writing hand?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lucky that&#39;s all I crushed, you scoundrel,&quot; her companion 
scolded.

&quot;And what was I supposed to say? I couldn&#39;t know that lout Adrastos 
would be here, could I? I had to give him something so he&#39;d leave the 
girl in peace. Besides, given my reputation I seriously doubt he&#39;ll 
question my story.&quot;

&quot;Um... Sappho?&quot;

Both Sappho and Clara now turned their attention back to Efterpi, the 
young woman stepping timidly forward as she addressed the poet, &quot;Sappho, 
I appreciate all you&#39;re trying to do for me, but I&#39;m not sure I 
understand it. Why are you trying to help me? You don&#39;t even know me. 
Besides, if you&#39;re here for Gyrinna...&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re wrong,&quot; she answered as she gently cupped the youth&#39;s chin 
in her hand, &quot;As far as Princess Gyrinna goes, I&#39;m afraid both her and I 
are currently political pawns in a game of diplomacy being played out 
between Athens and Lesbos. And as for not knowing you, child I&#39;ve known 
dozens of young women like you in Asia Minor, Lydia, Caria, Chalcidice 
and all points in between. This is a man&#39;s world, which is why we women 
must resort to our wits and our cunning to gain advantage, and why I&#39;m 
willing to help you any way I can. Now according to that ass of a king 
of yours, if we are to get you out of here so you and Princess Gyrinna 
can be together, I have to get your stepmother&#39;s permission. What is her 
name and where is she?&quot;

&quot;Her name is the Lady Phedra, and she lives in my father&#39;s home in 
Melite. But she&#39;s a proud and arrogant woman, and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;d 
be willing to see anyone unannounced.&quot;

&quot;I am Sappho,&quot; the poet responded, &quot;She will see me.&quot; Turning to Clara, 
she strode over to her companion with a determined look in her eyes, 
&quot;I&#39;ll be back soon, I promise. Meanwhile, when the king&#39;s servants bring 
in the tub and water for the bath, have Efterpi wash the perfume and 
paint from her face, and try to keep her out of sight until I return.&quot; 
Sappho paused and stepped closer, &quot;Clara,&quot; she said, her voice softening 
as she reached up to tenderly stroke her cheek, &quot;I know I can be a pain, 
and your nerves are probably frayed to the breaking point on my account. 
But please, be patient with me for just a bit longer?&quot;

Clara tried to look sternly at her, but soon enough her countenance 
lightened. &quot;You&#39;re lucky I love you so,&quot; she whispered as she leaned 
forward, Efterpi turning her head to give the two lovers a bit of 
privacy as their lips came together.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back soon,&quot; Sappho repeated as she and Clara separated. Turning 
to Efterpi, she smiled confidently, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that stepmother 
of yours. I&#39;ve been around aristocrats all my life, so I know a thing or 
two about speaking their humbuggery. Now just where in Melite is Lady 
Phedra anyways?&quot;

&quot;On a street named after the famed Andromeda,&quot; Efterpi answered, &quot;In a 
large white estate surrounded by cypress and a high gate. Oh, do be 
careful...&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Sappho said as she took up her staff and headed for the 
door, adding, &quot;Stay here until I return.&quot; And with that, she left the 
palace once more, this time in a royal carriage headed for the Athenian 
province of Melite.

An hour later, after passing verdant vineyards and lush forest land, 
Sappho&#39;s carriage arrived in Melite. Finding Andromeda&#39;s street was 
fairly simple, as was locating Lady Phedra&#39;s estate. The opulent fenced 
in structure stood out with its columned front, scented flower garden 
and statuary just inside the gate. Approaching the entrance, she was met 
by a young woman who, to put it politely, looked quite well fed. Sappho 
told the girl to go to the mistress of the house and explain she had 
business with her. The girl disappeared into the building, reappearing a 
short time later to unlock the gated entrance and show her in.

Inside the home Sappho saw more statuary, as well as several exotic 
looking plants sitting in ornately decorated pots. She also saw, above 
every doorpost, the image of a phallus carved in relief, symbol of good 
luck and fertility, while the walls themselves were covered with lush 
frescoes of satyrs and nymphs frolicking in forest glens.

At last she was shown to a door next to a burning incense censer. 
Entering the chamber, she found it filled with sunlight through two 
large windows, their curtains drawn back to reveal a large bed, far 
larger than the one provided for Sappho and Clara back at the palace, 
and covered in bear skins and finely woven sheets of an Arcadian weave.

In the center of the bed, lounging next to a fully nude young man, was a 
woman in her late thirties with jet black hair and amber eyes, a pink 
toga leaving little to the imagination. With a snap of her fingers, the 
young man got up and went over to a table by one of the windows, poured 
wine from a wineskin into a jeweled chalice, and passed it to her. He 
then left the room, Sappho&#39;s eyes following his movements until the door 
was shut behind him.

&quot;You don&#39;t seem too shocked to find a naked man here,&quot; the woman 
observed as she sipped the wine from her goblet.

Sappho shrugged her shoulders, &quot;I did come unannounced after all, 
besides,&quot; she added as she now met the woman&#39;s gaze, &quot;I&#39;ve seen bigger.&quot;

At that the woman laughed, &quot;It&#39;s indeed true what they say of your sharp 
wit, Sappho of Lesbos. I am Phedra.&quot;

&quot;As I gathered,&quot; the poet responded as she came closer, &quot;And he was?&quot;

&quot;Unimportant,&quot; Phedra responded offhandedly, adding, &quot;He&#39;s a would-be 
suitor for one of my daughters. Let&#39;s just say I wished to examine his 
worthiness,&quot; she said with a wink. Receiving no reply to her remark, she 
sipped once more from her cup. &quot;So what brings the great Sappho to my 
abode?&quot;

&quot;Efterpi,&quot; the poet answered, causing the other woman to choke a bit on 
her wine.

&quot;Efterpi? That annoying wench? Why should you wish to see me about her? 
She doesn&#39;t even reside beneath my roof anymore.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Sappho said, &quot;I wish to take her with me to Lesbos when I 
leave tomorrow with Princess Gyrinna. You&#39;ve cast the girl out; she 
obviously means nothing to you. I wish you to sign her over to me.&quot;

Lady Phedra began to stroke her cheek as she thoughtfully studied the 
older woman before her. Sappho didn&#39;t like the look in her eyes. The 
woman was obviously obsessed with status and appearance, one could see 
such by the d&eacute;cor she surrounded herself with and the way she presented 
herself, to say nothing of the fact she cast her stepdaughter from the 
house in order to secure her own children&#39;s future and her own. She was 
a social climber, and Sappho could tell she was trying to figure out 
what she could get out of releasing Efterpi to her.

&quot;Very well, I&#39;ll release Efterpi to you. For a price, that is.&quot;

Sappho tightened her grip upon her staff, &quot;And what is your price?&quot;

&quot;I have two daughters,&quot; Phedra began, &quot;You&#39;ve already met Neoma, she 
opened the gate to you. My other daughter, Urania, doesn&#39;t leave her 
room much. She&#39;s a bit touched I&#39;m afraid, poor thing&#39;s an infant in an 
adolescent&#39;s body. The only thing either have going for them is my 
fortune, and because of that alone several of the most prominent of 
Athens&#39; male population would give quite a bit to have them...&quot;

&quot;As I&#39;ve seen,&quot; Sappho quipped.

&quot;Yes, well, the wealthier their suitor is, the better I as the 
mother-in-law will be set. Now then, if they were to gain an education 
in oratory, etiquette and song from the great Sappho of Lesbos, not just 
Athenian society but men throughout Asia Minor and as far away as Lydia, 
Mysia and Phrygia would seek them out.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Sappho said, narrowing her eyes as she studied Lady Phedra, &quot;So 
if I allow your daughters admission into my academy, you&#39;ll sign her 
over to me? Is that it?&quot;

&quot;Not quite,&quot; Phaedra answered. She stood up, allowing Sappho to see that 
the toga she wore was only a flimsy sheet of pink silk draped over her 
statuesque body and held in place by a cord tied around her waste. It 
covered her front and back, but intentionally left her sides bare. 
Swinging her hips seductively she came towards the poet, smiling at her 
through half-closed eyelids. &quot;Your beauty has become legendary, you 
know,&quot; she purred, taking yet another sip from her goblet as she slinked 
around the other woman, &quot;Even in Athens, Sappho is synonymous with love 
and beauty. And now, seeing you before me, I think I understand why. 
Even at five and fifty...&quot;

&quot;Four and fifty,&quot; Sappho corrected.

&quot;...Four and fifty, and with grey hairs mixed in with gold, you&#39;re still 
quite alluring.&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Sappho asked, as the woman once more came around to face her.

&quot;I&#39;ve always found older, more experienced women captivating. And as 
you&#39;ve no doubt guessed, I find you to be very attractive. You may have 
the whelp Efterpi in exchange for the admission of my two daughters into 
your school, and in exchange for sharing my bed.&quot;

Sappho said nothing; she only stared more intensely at the woman before 
her. Phedra simply laughed at her reaction. &quot;Oh, come now. There&#39;s no 
need to scowl so. After all, I&#39;m not exactly unattractive myself, am I? 
Besides, from what I&#39;ve heard, in your youth you had more than your own 
fair share of conquests, both men and women. Sometimes both at the same 
time, if the tales they tell are true. And besides, I was there 
yesterday to behold your arrival into the city with the king and that... 
Well, face facts dear; you can put her in pretty garments and fix her 
hair up all you wish, but that woman you arrived with yesterday is as 
common as the dirt beneath your sandals and you know it...&quot;

&quot;Enough!&quot; Sappho yelled angrily, slamming her staff to the floor with a 
loud thud that caught the Lady Phedra by surprise, &quot;You presume too 
much, you pompous social climbing wench! I&#39;ll not be treated like one of 
those toady suitors you keep around as pets for your amusement, and I&#39;ll 
not stand for your speaking ill of Clara!&quot; she said, her voice cracking 
at the end.

Lady Phedra&#39;s eyes widened momentarily in fear at the outburst, taking a 
step back and looking away from Sappho&#39;s angry glare as she recovered 
herself. &quot;Well,&quot; she finally said, &quot;You need not cause such a rumpus. 
After all, we aren&#39;t all that different in matters of the boudoir.&quot;

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Sappho responded, &quot;Then again, maybe the stories told about me 
for the most part are just that; stories. Maybe I&#39;m nowhere near as 
promiscuous as I allow people to believe. Maybe making love is more than 
simply an act or a pastime to me. Maybe it means more to me than you.&quot;

&quot;Oh please, don&#39;t presume to lecture me on morals. Look, you want the 
girl, admit it. I don&#39;t blame you; I half fancied the pup myself. On my 
end I want you, both for your beauty and for the benefits of good 
fortune involved in loving one who is loved of the gods, and of 
Aphrodite in particular. You see,&quot; she said in a hushed tone, &quot;I know a 
thing or two about the dark arts, and if we were to share such an 
intimate act no doubt some of your luck will wash upon me as well.&quot;

At that Sappho smirked, &quot;I&#39;ve heard many a superstitious hogwash in my 
day, but this is the first time I&#39;ve ever heard of anybody looking upon 
my vagina as some sort of good luck charm.&quot;

Rather than being offended, Phedra chuckled as she finished off her 
wine. &quot;Be that as it may, those are my terms. Admit my daughters and 
share my bed, or Efterpi stays on the street. I&#39;ve been invited to the 
soir&eacute;e at the palace tonight to say a fond farewell to the Princess 
Gyrinna. You have until tonight to change your mind.&quot; Turning her back 
on Sappho, she strutted to the door and opened it, &quot;Shall I have my 
daughter Neoma lead you back to the gate?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Sappho hissed, &quot;But I&#39;ll show myself out.&quot; With that she 
brushed roughly past Lady Phedra and strode angrily from the house, 
slamming the gate closed behind her as she headed for the royal carriage 
waiting to take her back to the palace.

-To Be Continued-

End Notes: Don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t forgotten about Princess Gyrinna. 
She&#39;ll be playing a prominent role in the finale next chapter.
