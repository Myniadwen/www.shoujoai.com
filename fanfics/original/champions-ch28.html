<a href="../original/champions-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Kissa and Kali

There was...void. Everywhere, there was...void. There was nothing else, 
except for the wide open space, an endless span of...void. It was not 
empty, but neither was it full. It was just...a space, like the universe 
itself, but there were no feelings of emptiness or loneliness, really no 
feelings at all, except peace, everlasting peace. It was not quiet, but 
neither was it loud; it was tranquility, like living in the mountains, 
but so real that one would believe all previous lives to be imaginary. 
That&#39;s what it was like to be dead&#151;at least Rin thought so. She was, for 
lack of a better term, floating in that space, quite happy and at peace, 
and Kailin was there too, silent and serene. Rin actually liked it.

&quot;Hard to believe,&quot; she said, if the dead could speak or hear what was 
spoken. She reflected and not lamented, for there was only reflection in 
death, and no emotion save a quiet calm. &quot;We&#39;re really dead,&quot; said Rin 
again, looking at what she would call hands in that Living World. Here, 
there wasn&#39;t a name for anything, perhaps not even she herself or 
Kailin. She didn&#39;t even need to take a breath to form her next thought: 
&quot;I never thought it&#39;d happen that way.&quot;

&quot;The dead must accept their fate,&quot; said Kailin wisely, the first time 
she had spoken (if there was such thing as time in that place). &quot;It&#39;s 
clear we&#39;re dead, and I believe there&#39;s nothing we can do about it. So 
the faster we can accept things, the better we will enjoy eternity.&quot;

&quot;But everyone has regrets,&quot; noted Rin. &quot;I suppose I will learn in time 
all the answers to the questions I wanted to ask. You would think 
omniscience would be granted to us&#151;after all, we&#39;re dead, aren&#39;t we? We 
should start knowing things.&quot;

&quot;What would you know?&quot;

&quot;Stuff about Snowblood, mostly. And that woman who killed us. Of course, 
I&#39;d like to know about the world in general...and also, could we get 
back?&quot;

&quot;Why would we want to? I&#39;m happy right here.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but Captain Cuddles isn&#39;t going to take care of herself.&quot; The two 
spirits, if that&#39;s what they were, exchanged a pure smile.

&quot;All right. I think that may be the only reason I want to go back, 
though.&quot;

&quot;And to avenge our deaths, but right now I don&#39;t feel any hatred at all. 
I kind of understand that woman. I suppose if I did get back, I&#39;d 
despise her and want to kill her, but those thoughts are far and away 
now. Do you know where we even are?&quot;

&quot;Heaven, I would say. This certainly isn&#39;t Hell.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but did we deserve to go to Heaven? Or is this place just a rest 
stop for souls? Do you think it&#39;s a...purgatory or a limbo?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet,&quot; said Kailin softly. &quot;All I know is that we&#39;re dead, 
and all the pain is gone. I don&#39;t want or need anything, not even air. 
Being dead certainly has advantages.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; drawled Rin. &quot;If I didn&#39;t have so many questions, I&#39;d actually 
like it.&quot;

&quot;But there&#39;s no coming back from this place,&quot; noted Hsu; &quot;not if you 
don&#39;t want to be a zombie.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d rather stay here.&quot;

&quot;Me too.&quot; They shared silence for what could&#39;ve been a million years or 
a hundredth of a second; time did not exist for the dead. Kailin 
swam&#151;again, for lack of a better term&#151;closer to Rin and looked at her, 
seeing her caretaker and friend for the very first time. The Living Rin 
had been ugly, crude, like a piece of tree bark, compared to Dead Rin, 
who glowed in her true form, the stuff she was really made of. Kailin 
herself was illuminating, and after seeing herself&#151;for sight beyond her 
own eyes was as easy as moving&#151;she concluded that she was much more 
attractive dead than alive, not that vanity existed.

Oh my goodness!!

A sharp voice, screeching with surprise, broke them from their dreamy 
paradise. The two looked over and saw a third figure with them, though 
it looked like they were only halfway there, halfway somewhere else. A 
ghost in Heaven? The two, having nothing else to do, approached the 
ghost carefully, not that there was any fear where they were. They were 
just curious.

&quot;Hello,&quot; said Rin peacefully. The ghost, or the blur&#151;it was really more 
a blur than a ghost&#151;seemed to recoil, which was strange. It shouldn&#39;t 
have been afraid.

In all my years, I never thought I&#39;d see more of my kind! exclaimed the 
blur.

&quot;What do you mean? Aren&#39;t you dead?&quot;

No, I&#39;m not. The puzzle was becoming larger, but not necessarily more 
confusing. The spirit-girls looked each other in the face, then the 
blur.

&quot;Are you a spirit like us?&quot;

I...oh darn, I&#39;m out of time. Stay there! The blur ceased to be, which 
was a surprise, but it soon came back, perhaps a year later. Sorry I 
took so long; ghosting takes a lot out of me. I have to recover or I&#39;ll 
cross over completely!

&quot;So you are a ghost,&quot; stated Kailin.

No, no, I&#39;m fully alive; I just never thought I&#39;d see others like me.

&quot;This is tricky,&quot; observed Rin. She decided to clarify things on their 
end: &quot;We&#39;re dead, whoever you are, and we&#39;re apparently spirits or 
ghosts. We can&#39;t see you too well, so we&#39;re guessing...&quot;

Oh! This is unusual! I never thought I&#39;d run into real ghosts before! 
...Just a second! Blast. My time&#39;s out again. I can only stay like this 
for a minute.

&quot;But you just got here.&quot;

No, I&#39;ve been here a minute. Hold on, I&#39;ll be right back. The blur 
vanished again, but reappeared just as quickly: Sorry, I&#39;ve been really 
busy lately. I couldn&#39;t start ghosting for several hours.

&quot;But you were only gone for a moment.&quot;

What? Oh, wait, that makes sense. The dead, as you are, have no concept 
of time. I see. Oh, I should introduce myself. My name&#39;s Joanna White. 
Rin and Kailin introduced themselves, and the blur, Joanna White, said 
she&#151;it sounded feminine&#151;was very pleased to meet them, even though they 
were dead.

&quot;I think I have more questions now,&quot; Rin said, and Joanna agreed, also 
bearing questions. She first explained that she could, in a sense, 
become a ghost&#151;or rather, she could project her spiritual aura out like 
a ghost, and wander around the world in spirit form. She explained that 
she had been wandering around normally one day, and came across two 
mysterious blurs, and that was when the three must&#39;ve met. However, 
Joanna could not stay a ghost for very long&#151;it was like holding her 
breath&#151;so that accounted for her coming and going. Once they had that 
out of the way, Joanna vanished, saying she wanted to know more about 
the strangers she had met. Rin and Kailin, not being bound by time, 
hardly had to wait a moment, but for Joanna, time passed on, sometimes 
several hours or even a day or two if she was busy.

But in time, they all learned quite a bit from each other. Rin and 
Kailin told Joanna about their lives, about how Rin was a super-strong 
daughter of a swordsmith and Kailin a pyrokinetic who had once been used 
as a possible biological weapon. They each gave account of their history 
together, about how they wandered around getting into adventures, how 
Rin met her supposed enemy Snowblood, how the two had fought in the Iron 
Games Arena, and finally, how they had been killed. Joanna took it all 
in carefully and patiently, and had this to say at the end: Wow.

She elaborated quickly: I suppose the dead do have great stories to 
tell. Mine&#39;s not quite as exciting, so bear with me. I was, uh...born 
into a family that didn&#39;t like me because I wasn&#39;t...quite the son my 
father had wanted. I got my powers by falling down the stairs, to the 
best of my knowledge. I learned I could send my aura out into the world, 
separating spirit from body, just like a ghost. I could even lift some 
objects by hardening my ghostly shell, which resulted in me getting a 
tray of nasty food while I was bedridden.

I was at the Arena, too, she told them rather proudly, but excused 
herself and was gone before either of them heard more. She was back 
almost instantly, of course, and resumed: Anyway, I was employed briefly 
by this woman named Dr. Kamaguchi, and she had me take the prize money. 
I&#39;m usually accustomed to small-time theft, but I was paid well for my 
work. I also did a second job, but I won&#39;t even tell that to the dead.

&quot;So you worked for Yohko Kamaguchi?&quot; said Kailin, fascinated by the 
story. &quot;So you were the one that took the prize money! Don&#39;t you feel 
bad about that?&quot;

Not really. I&#39;ve been a thief most of my life. Everyone does it, believe 
me; I just don&#39;t steal more than I need. I ended up calling myself the 
Ferret, because I could sneak into anywhere and do practically anything, 
which is why the doctor hired me.

&quot;That&#39;s really quite despicable,&quot; said Rin, though it didn&#39;t sound harsh 
at all.

Oh, there are worse kinds of people in this world&#151;um, I mean, &quot;my&quot; 
world, excuse me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m doing anything bad. And I never 
steal everything.

&quot;Still, it&#39;s wrong.&quot;

I know. Oh, darn&#151;I&#39;ve got to go again. I can&#39;t seem to stay a ghost for 
more than ninety seconds! Be right back!

Rin looked at Kailin. Well, she was certainly getting some answers.

Okay, that didn&#39;t take as long as I thought. Anyway, you&#39;re right, but 
what other choice do I have? That&#39;s why I took Kamaguchi&#39;s offer, so I 
wouldn&#39;t have to steal for a long time. I&#39;m really not a bad person.

&quot;I agree,&quot; said Kailin happily. &quot;I like you.&quot;

Oh, thanks. I&#39;m flattered a ghost would like me. Kailin laughed merrily, 
a sweet and harmonious melody, which caused Rin to smile too. Joanna, to 
the best of their knowledge, looked embarrassed. I wish I had known you 
two while you were still alive. It&#39;s a pity I didn&#39;t know who you were 
back at the Arena! Otherwise we could&#39;ve been friends! ...Hold on.

Okay, I&#39;m back. Listen, if there&#39;s anything I could do for you two...um, 
not that the dead really need anything!

&quot;I think we&#39;re content for now,&quot; said Rin, who felt stuffed despite her 
new lot in the afterlife. &quot;We were actually discussing whether or not we 
could return, but that seems impossible.&quot;

I&#39;ve never met anyone who could bring back the dead. I&#39;ve heard of 
people like that, of course, but they&#39;re usually necromancers. Dangerous 
business getting involved with them. They&#39;d turn you girls into zombies, 
and I couldn&#39;t bear that thought.

&quot;Nor could we!&quot; added Rin. Joanna laughed, but it sounded foggy and 
distant.

If I come across anything, I&#39;ll let you know. Don&#39;t be too disappointed 
if I can&#39;t, though.

&quot;We certainly won&#39;t. Are you leaving now?&quot;

Yes, I&#39;ve spent way too much time with you, no offense. It&#39;s time to get 
back to the real world&#151;not that this place is any more real than yours 
is! Maybe I am just going into a fake world, but whatever. I&#39;ll be 
seeing you!

&quot;Bye, Joanna! It was nice meeting you! Come and visit sometime soon!&quot; 
The girls waved farewell, and the blur left them&#151;but of course, since 
they were dead, it could&#39;ve been gone for a hundred years and would 
reappear the very next instant in their eyes, which is exactly what it 
did.

It&#39;s been awhile. How are you two?

&quot;Uh...it hasn&#39;t been that long since we spoke, Joanna. You just left.&quot;

Oh, did I? Ah, that&#39;s right, I forgot. Well, uh, I just wanted to say 
that...I still don&#39;t have any means of getting you back. But I am 
looking, trust me! I just wanted to say that, and drop by.

&quot;Oh, all right. Well, it was good seeing you again.&quot; The blur seemed to 
glow, and faded again. No sooner did it leave, however, than did another 
blur appear, different than Joanna&#39;s. This one was sharp, fluid, and 
seemed ancient beyond human (but not spirit) comprehension. It was 
clearly a woman, and she even had the courtesy to introduce herself to 
the spirits.

So you&#39;re the ones who&#39;ve been in my dreams! Lately I&#39;ve been having 
strange visions about two new souls in the spatial plane, and although I 
normally never give them a second thought, something told me that you 
would be special. Hello, then, special specters of the deep. I am Kissa, 
servant of the god of the dead, and so that makes us related in a sense.

&quot;Kissa?&quot;

That is my name. My dreams didn&#39;t tell me yours.

&quot;Rin and Kailin.&quot;

What pretty names! Yes, yes, I see...you were very beautiful in life and 
are twice that in death! I&#39;m not disappointed!

&quot;Uh, excuse me,&quot; said Kailin, &quot;but who exactly are you? And how can you 
speak with us?&quot; The blur called Kissa sighed dramatically, and waved 
what appeared to be an arm, though it could&#39;ve been her nose.

Ah! The answer to both questions would take an age! But all three of us 
have all the time in the world, don&#39;t we? I&#39;ll be brief, though: I am a 
magician of sorts, and I&#39;ve discovered the secrets of death and 
immortality. It has taken me several eons to fully realize this goal, 
but to an immortal, or a spirit, a thousand years is but an instant. I, 
Kissa, Hathor-Sakmet, am arbiter of souls and the dead. I can usually 
conjure them up, or see them in visions, as I did the two of you, and I 
may speak with them as long as they allow me.

&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed Rin, who had felt something eerily akin to hope. &quot;Did 
Joanna send you here?&quot;

Who?

&quot;Joanna White! The Ferret!&quot;

My dear soul, I&#39;ve no idea who you&#39;re talking about. I saw the two of 
you in a dream. No Ferret sent me; I come and go as I please.

&quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; said Rin, although she had meant to murmur it. &quot;Where 
could she be, then?&quot;

If this friend of yours is dead, I will be able to find them easily.

&quot;No, not dead,&quot; corrected Kailin. &quot;More like...she can turn into a 
ghost...or send her spirit out of her body.&quot;

Oh, sounds like a form of necromancy! That sort of thing is reserved for 
the very powerful! She must indeed be a respectable person if she can 
speak with you.

&quot;Well, she&#39;s sort of our friend, but she usually comes around a lot. We 
don&#39;t know why she hasn&#39;t come back.&quot;

Maybe she has grown tired of you.

&quot;But time passes&#151;&quot;

Differently, I know. Alas, I cannot explain the higher powers; I can 
only try to understand them. And even I, older than any civilization in 
my world, cannot understand this, why your friend is not around. But I 
can speak with you.

The familiar feeling of hope, brittle and distant, came back again, or 
the ghost of it did. Rin nearly shouted, &quot;Excuse me, Lady Kissa, but is 
it in your power to bring us back to life without making us zombies?&quot;

Oh dear, that&#39;s a delicate question. Of course, reviving the dead is 
easy, providing they don&#39;t mind being undead, but a total revivification 
is another matter. It&#39;s been done before, and by my own hands as well, 
so it&#39;s &quot;possible&quot;. But very tricky, very hard indeed. And I would have 
to be paid well.

&quot;We have nothing,&quot; Kailin said, almost disappointed.

Not now, you don&#39;t. Silly! I mean once you are alive. You&#39;ll have to 
give me a service. Bringing the dead back to life, to total life, is 
very costly, and I must have something to compensate the loss.

&quot;Careful,&quot; said Rin, touching Kailin. &quot;I have an odd feeling about this 
one. We mustn&#39;t be hasty. Odds are the price she&#39;ll ask will be high.&quot;

How very rude of you! Kissa exclaimed suddenly. And in my own presence! 
The dead cannot hide anything from me once I speak with them, so don&#39;t 
whisper like that! So my price may be too high, eh? You know, I don&#39;t 
have to do anything. I&#39;m perfectly happy speaking with you. As a matter 
of fact, you&#39;re beginning to bore me.

&quot;Wait, don&#39;t go!&quot; Rin noticed that Kailin had called out, but wasn&#39;t 
mad. Intrigued, maybe. &quot;What would we have to do?&quot; Kissa&#39;s blur seemed 
to turn back and, across the voids, give them a smirk.

I don&#39;t know yet. Kill an enemy or help me find a treasure. Be my slave 
or my sex-girls. Perform a difficult task, chant a few spells, maybe 
entertain me with a song. I don&#39;t know. Give me some time. I&#39;ll tell you 
what I want before I do anything, and you must agree with it. By the 
way, are your bodies still in good condition?

&quot;Our heads were cut off,&quot; said Rin, &quot;both of ours.&quot;

Hmm, that&#39;s difficult. The easiest thing to fix is a whole body. But at 
least the parts are still around, I hope. Perhaps I could find somebody 
who could forge the head back onto the neck. We&#39;ll see. For now, I shall 
leave you and conduct other businesses. Until we meet again, remember! I 
won&#39;t say yes until you do!

Kissa&#39;s blur was gone, and so were the feelings of mistrust that Rin and 
Kailin had felt. Strangely, once she was gone, Joanna&#39;s blur came right 
back.

What happened? she demanded. I tried coming back but was restricted! It 
was like a wall had formed that I couldn&#39;t get through! Rin and Kailin 
exchanged a wary look, and told their friend what had happened why she 
was gone. Things were looking grim indeed, and if they weren&#39;t careful, 
they would probably get worse.

.........

Kill Rin Takamatsu. Kill Rin Takamatsu. Kill the Takamatsu daughter. 
Kill the Ronin. Kill her. Kill&#151;or else. That was her mission, her very 
last one in the service of the Crimson Blades, though she herself, even 
with her gifts, did not know for whom she worked. She was the 
second-strongest one in their ranks, the one Sashuo left in charge when 
he parted for other businesses, and aside from the green-armored 
warrior, was the most effective and perhaps most brutal one among them. 
And she had been told to kill, kill Rin Takamatsu the Ronin, and all 
shall be well&#151;her term will expire.

But she could not bear to kill such a worthy foe, such a bright and 
shining soul, and such&#151;if during her weak moments she could consider 
it&#151;a good potential friend. Yes, she could easily be Rin&#39;s friend, if 
she hadn&#39;t been ordered to kill her, and perhaps more than friends. She 
could see into the young woman&#39;s heart and sense the beauty that 
radiated out, rough and crude though it may be. She could sense that 
Rin, though wary, had wanted to reach out, to help, but that was not 
possible. She would only doom herself, and others.

She had no choice. But she wanted to observe her target more, so after 
the tournament she sat alone in the desert, a pack full of food and 
water by her side and a parasol above, and meditated in the silence. She 
allowed the emptiness to consume her, and it let her see into the void, 
into time and space itself. Her amazing psychic powers, perhaps 
magnified by her lack of sight, plumbed the depths of the cosmos and 
every single atom that populated it. She could see Rin&#39;s life-force 
easily, along with Kailin&#39;s and that panda&#39;s, and followed it carefully, 
as one would follow a hart. She watched from afar as Rin took Kailin to 
the beach, and wished, though deep in a trance, that she was there with 
her, whether as friend or foe. She preferred to be a friend, but that 
couldn&#39;t be helped.

Suddenly, a stabbing pain touched Lady Snowblood&#39;s mind, and she broke 
out of her meditation with a chilling start. It couldn&#39;t be! It was like 
watching two candles suddenly being snuffed out&#151;thuft. She sat, 
cross-legged and gaping in shock, as the full scope of what had just 
happened suffocated her senses. She had just...Rin had just been killed. 
Just like that. In one simple motion. Just like that, as easy as blowing 
a candle out. Kailin too. Snowblood shivered, and keened softly, not 
wanting it to be true.

She forced herself back into the meditation and searched for Rin, 
seeking out her unique life-force against the backdrop of billions. She 
knew Rin&#39;s by heart, having seen it in battle many times, and knew what 
to look for. But it was gone, lost even to her skills, and that could 
only mean one thing: dead. Rin Takamatsu was dead.

&quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; whispered Snowblood, feeling an unusual chill. &quot;It just 
can&#39;t! Rin would never die so easily! Whoever killed her must&#39;ve been 
gifted with radical powers, the likes of which are out of place even in 
this world. Oh Rin, how could you die? How could you leave this world? 
How could you allow me to lose my honor? Oh, Rin, why? Why now? Must 
she...must she be safe at the cost of your life? I had 
hoped...foolishly, perhaps...that the two of you could both find a way 
to live. Oh, Rin! My sworn enemy, what has happened!?&quot;

Snowblood felt tears and was surprised to find she was crying. She wiped 
them off, feeling their wetness yet cursed never to see their forms, and 
flung them into the sand. The honor was hers, and hers alone. Snowblood 
had been asked to kill Rin, and so it fell to her honor, and hers alone, 
to carry out that task. No other creature had that right. Snowblood 
stood, though she still wept, and protruded an angry face though she 
knew not who had committed such an unforgivable crime.

&quot;I will avenge you!&quot; she exclaimed to the desert. &quot;I will avenge you 
both! I shall slay the monster who stole you from me, and in this action 
I shall regain my honor! O Rin, I pray your death will not be in vain. I 
pray that at least she can be saved...&quot; Of course, Snowblood had no idea 
who, or where the killer was, and had she been anybody else, she 
would&#39;ve wondered forever. But she was the Lady Snowblood, and she could 
find out&#151;and all it took was quiet, deep meditation, mixed with tears of 
sorrow.

I should have told her, she lamented. Oh, Rin, I should have told 
you...everything!

Forgive me.

......
Several days later...

It then became inevitable that Kali, goddess of death and slayer of the 
two Ronin, would encounter Lady Snowblood, who had staked the claim on 
Rin&#39;s life. Snowblood had to fast for two grueling days just to learn 
the identity of Rin&#39;s killer, and many agonizing hours afterward 
locating her. The graveyard that Kali had visited&#151;where she rebelled 
against her &quot;creator&quot; not long ago&#151;was the last clue Snowblood got 
before she fell exhausted. She resolved to eat and sleep at long last, 
and moved out of the desert to stay hot on the trail. With her 
extrasensory perception aiding her, it did not take long to find Kali&#39;s 
whereabouts.

By that time, Snowblood could recognize the monstrous woman&#39;s life-force 
apart from everyone else&#39;s. It was horrible and pulsed with unnatural 
power, resembling an alien rather than a domestic life, as if she had 
come from some other planet. The idea was not improbable, and it 
might&#39;ve explained something, but that didn&#39;t matter to Snowblood. All 
she needed to know was where&#151;which she got&#151;and how, which would be 
harder. Rin was 1-and-1 with Snowblood, and their last fight had been 
more of a tie than a loss for her. If Snowblood could not overwhelmingly 
defeat her, how could she possibly overcome the one who had so simply 
snuffed Rin&#39;s life out? She knew the battle would be ferocious, perhaps 
impossible to win. But such was revenge.

Snowblood was achingly beautiful as she stood firm before her nemesis. 
The long black hair she had was tied up neatly and well, with deadly 
hairpins that could kill if thrown properly. Her vapid brown eyes were 
uncovered by her dark glasses, now thrown to the floor uselessly. Her 
skin was as pale as Kali&#39;s, her body curvy and fit, contrasting the more 
buff woman standing across from her, staring and smiling. Her kimono, 
splotched lilac, quivered when the wind kissed it, like a lover stirring 
in another&#39;s presence. She took her straw hat and lifted it fully, 
wanting her enemy to get a good long look at the person who would soon 
end her life.

&quot;My name is Snowblood,&quot; addressed the warrior. &quot;You are the one who slew 
Rin Takamatsu, daughter of Toguka Takamatsu; and Hsu Kai Lin, daughter 
of flames. Tell me your name.&quot;

&quot;Kali,&quot; answered her foe emptily, &quot;and I very well may have killed those 
two, along with a countless number of others. This is the first time 
I&#39;ve been so openly accused of it, though.&quot;

&quot;The death of Rin Takamatsu was my task,&quot; announced Snowblood as wind 
started to pick up. &quot;I had staked a claim on her life; to kill her was 
my duty, though I loathed it. According to the ancient laws, I must 
avenge her life by destroying her killer.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see why you&#39;re so upset,&quot; said Kali. &quot;Why does it matter who 
kills her, as long as it&#39;s done?&quot;

&quot;The honor was mine,&quot; stated Snowblood sharply, staring with dead eyes. 
&quot;Mine, and mine alone. The privilege did not belong to you. Therefore, I 
must kill the one who interfered.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re crazy,&quot; said Kali nonchalantly. Snowblood roared and threw her 
straw hat off, completely unsheathing from her walking stick a long 
sword, and ran after the cruel woman with all her strength and senses at 
full. Kali merely observed, not quite feeling up to another death that 
day. Well, perhaps just one more. She watched Snowblood approach her 
quickly, both walking stick and sword crossed, feet dashing, voice 
crying out... Her energy weapon came forth and...
Leap!

Snowblood obeyed, and missed being split in two. She jumped and twirled 
backwards in the air, and came again as soon as she was grounded. Kali 
watched with increased amazement and commanded her weapon to lash at the 
ground, cut off Snowblood&#39;s feet. The blind woman&#151;Swerve!&#151;had to 
completely rely&#151;Somersault!&#151;on her skills, trusting fully&#151;Jump!&#151;in their 
judgment&#151;Duck! She could feel the deadly weapon sizzling around her, 
lashing and jumping like a serpent, and had to perform painful 
acrobatics just to keep from being mutilated.

Turn! Twist! Dive! Thrust! Unable to move, she swung her weapon and 
caught the wave of energy on her weapons, shielding herself from its 
thirst. Kali grinned from afar and commanded the snaking thing to 
swerve, burrow through Snowblood from behind&#151;Clang! Snowblood now had 
both weapons blocked against the pierce of the enemy, and was visibly 
straining. She was far from strong, and Kali&#39;s power was incredible.

Jump! She leaped as high as her legs could allow, and good thing: the 
two spears thrust forth suddenly, and had nearly cut two holes in her 
body. She soared and fell, tumbling this way and that just to avoid the 
dash and gash of the blade&#151;Szz! Snowblood let out a scream as her arm 
was cut, just below the shoulder, and jerked away before the weapon 
could cleave it off. It was just a scar, but it was her blood on the 
ground, not Kali&#39;s. That was a problem.

Snowblood was no closer to her enemy, and was kept at a good distance, 
struggling just to stay ahead of the weapon. She could fly 
magnificently, but could not last all day, and Kali didn&#39;t seem like she 
was worn out at all; in fact, she laughed, amused at the sight of her 
would-be assassin dancing around like that. Snowblood mashed her teeth 
together as another cut burned her leg, and another her face, and two 
more at her stomach, and another her chest, nearly cleaving her right 
breast off. She stumbled, not daring to pause for an instant, and soared 
after Kali, ignoring briefly the wounds.

The goddess of death ordered her weapon to coil up close, intending to 
ensnare Snowblood once she was near. Snowblood just ran, knowing for the 
moment that she could run faster than the energy weapon. She would have 
one shot&#151;it would have to be a death blow. Kali smiled as her enemy 
closed in, and flicked her wrist, causing her malleable weapon to quiver 
and become a wild whip, lashing randomly. It scorched against 
Snowblood&#39;s back, causing her to scream&#151;but she did not stop. Kali&#39;s 
face opened in surprise and she swung her fist quickly.

Get down! Snowblood dove to the side and slashed with all her might. She 
knew she connected because she smelled foreign blood, and had felt the 
sword dig into flesh, but cursed as she fell and rolled on the ground. 
Unless Kali was made out of film, that little scratch wouldn&#39;t have 
killed her. Still, it was something, and for that, the goddess of death 
paused. Her attacks ceased. She looked down, at her ripped shirt, and 
gingerly touched the open wound. She had been sliced just to the left of 
her solar plexus, and while it wasn&#39;t deep or even that long, it was 
still blood, her blood, and it trickled out fine.

It tasted awful when she put her red finger to her mouth.

&quot;I&#39;ll be damned,&quot; she remarked. The energy weapon dissolved, and the 
goddess smiled darkly. &quot;You&#39;ve got a bit of skill to do that. And you 
amused me with all your weaving around. I think I won&#39;t kill you.&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t...stop!&quot; roared Snowblood, though she was covered with scars 
and drenched in her own sweat. Her throat was aflame with each gasp she 
took, and her muscles felt like they had been dashed upon rocks. Her 
legs were wobbly, and her arms were barely strong enough to hoist 
herself halfway up. She had used everything at her disposal just to 
survive a few minutes against this monster...but all she had for it was 
a little scar that would heal and dissolve in weeks.

&quot;Your tenacity is admirable,&quot; noted Kali, growing bored with Snowblood. 
&quot;I said I&#39;ll spare you, so maybe you should take it while you can. You 
impressed me, and that&#39;s worth something in my mind. Besides, I&#39;ve 
killed enough for today.&quot; She waved lazily and walked away, but 
Snowblood would have none of it. She actually found strength to stand 
and limp after the taller woman, but it was like walking with a boulder 
on her back.

&quot;Stop,&quot; she demanded, &quot;I won&#39;t let you...go! I will...avenge her!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give me an excuse to forget what I said,&quot; Kali warned as the 
distance between them grew. Even if she had the strength to stand&#151;which 
she soon did not&#151;Snowblood was incapable of following Kali, as she 
walked much faster and had only one minor wound to speak of. Snowblood 
had far too many&#151;some were deeper, more personal, more close to her 
heart&#151;and as she lay there in the desert, recovering and weeping in 
sorrow, only one thing crossed her mind.

Rin...please forgive me. I have failed you.
