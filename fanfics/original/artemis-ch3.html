<a href="../original/artemis-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>        Jasmine smiled warmly, her long violet hair back from her face 
as she put a white gloved hand on Alex&#39;s. &quot;You blush charmingly,&quot; she 
said.

        Alex smiled back, her short red hair falling into eyes that were 
a vivid shade of forest green. &quot;It&#39;s not helping my butch image much, 
though,&quot; she admitted, her black suit fitting her snugly as she studied 
Jasmine thoughtfully.

        The woman&#39;s tanned skin glowed with health, the slinky purple 
dress that she was wearing hugging her generously proportioned body. 
Jasmine&#39;s eyes shone blue as she smiled, those white teeth flashing in 
the light of the bar. She was a ravishing beauty, despite her disturbing 
revelation that she wasn&#39;t quite human.

        &quot;I prefer a softer butch myself,&quot; Jasmine looked down with a 
false sort of shyness, &quot;I&#39;ve even been known to flip my lovers at 
times.&quot;

        Alex fought to keep from blushing as a mental image popped into 
her head, Jasmine laying over feer dominantly and taking command in the 
bedroom. &quot;I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; Alex admitted.

        &quot;Oooh,&quot; Jasmine&#39;s eyes lit up happily. Alex had to fight back a 
laugh, the woman looked just like a kid in a candy store just then.

        The singer came from the back, sitting on a chair with her 
guitar. As she sang a gentle love song chairs were shifted aside, 
clearing a dance floor. One or two couples started out, then more took 
their places to sway to the music.

        Alex slipped off her stool, offering Jasmine her hand. &quot;Do you 
want to ...?&quot; she asked, her gaze meeting those beautiful eyes.

        &quot;Please,&quot; Jasmine followed her out to the dance floor.

        Jasmine snuggled into Alex&#39;s arms, the two of them swaying 
together to the sound of the music. Alex was nervous at first, moving 
stiffly, but after a few moments they began to move together with a bit 
more grace. She let her hands slide down from Jasmine&#39;s shoulders to the 
small of her back then hesitated, wanting to go further but not sure if 
she should.

        &quot;Eep,&quot; Alex gasped as hands slid down her back to grab at her 
bottom. &#39;Guess that answers that,&#39; she thought, pulling Jasmine closer.

        Jasmine stroked Alex&#39;s bottom a moment, the other hand sliding 
back up to her back. &quot;Nice muscles,&quot; she purred.

        Alex let her hands claim Jasmine&#39;s round bottom, sighing as 
their bodies began to grind together instinctively. Her breasts slid 
against Jasmin&#39;s larger breasts and she shifted her leg a bit to press 
to the other woman&#39;s crotch. &quot;You feel so good,&quot; Alex murmured into her 
ear.

        &quot;Naughty girl,&quot; Jasmine shuddered visibly in her grip. She 
looked up at Alex with smokey eyes, &quot;Let&#39;s get a room.&quot;

        &quot;Lead the way,&quot; Alex answered, her own voice husky with want.

        Jasmine held Alex&#39;s hand as they walked out of the lounge. She 
spotted the manager a few moments and smiled at her charmingly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
suppose you still have a room available?&quot;

        Circe nodded slightly, her long blonde hair flowing down her 
back. &quot;For you, of course,&quot; she said. She dropped her voice and looked 
towards Alex, &quot;Does she know....?&quot;

        &quot;She&#39;s told me,&quot; Alex said, easily being able to guess what 
Circe was asking about.

        Jasmine flashed Alex a warm smile as she said to Circe, &quot;And I 
intend to show her everything, later tonight.&quot;

        &quot;Then have a good evening,&quot; Circe laughed as she lead them back 
to the bar. From behind the counter she pulled a battered ring of keys, 
&quot;Is number five good?&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Jasmine took the key and gently tugged Alex 
out the back door.

        A grassy lawn stretched out before them, stones set into it 
leading towards a hotel next door to the bar. &quot;She runs this, too?&quot; Alex 
blinked as they walked, enjoying the night air.

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Jasmine nodded, &quot;they bought both buildings, but the 
hotel was condemned years back. Through help in the community they 
brought it back up to building code requirements and rent rooms out to 
bar patrons.&quot;

        &quot;The community,&quot; Alex murmured, enjoying the sensation of 
Jasmine&#39;s fingers in hers, &quot;do you mean the lesbian community?&quot;

        &quot;No, the supernatural one,&quot; Jasmine chuckled at the look on 
Alex&#39;s face. &quot;The Daughters is a regular haunt of the more... unusual 
citizens in our city,&quot; she hesitated a moment before asking, &quot;I hope you 
don&#39;t mind that I took you here?&quot;

        They reached the enterance to the hotel but Jasmine stopped them 
there while she waited for Alex&#39;s answer, the pale moonlight shining 
down on them. &quot;No, I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Alex said gently. She smiled down at 
Jasmine, &quot;I let you choose the place, remember?&quot;

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Jasmine went up on tiptoes, pressing her lips to 
Alex&#39;s in a sudden kiss. A second later she was pulling the door open 
and tugging Alex after her, &quot;Come on!&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Alex laughed.

        There wasn&#39;t anyone at the reception desk and Jasmine sailed by 
like she owned the place. Down the hall and they reached an old 
fashioned elevator, a metal gate sliding aside to let them in. 
Thankfully the controls were modern, showing how much it had been 
refitted over the years. They went up a few floors then Jasmine stopped 
it, letting them out onto a lushly carpeted floor.

        Jasmine pulled on Alex&#39;s hand, &quot;Follow me.&quot; They went down a 
hall to a door labeled five dash one and she unlocked it, &quot;I hope you 
like this.&quot;

        Alex stepped inside then stopped, eyes wide as she took in the 
gigantic circular bed. White sheets blew gently in a air conditioned 
breeze, lushly stuffed pillows set around the bed. To one side was a wet 
bar and over on the other side a TV set rested on a stand, one would 
assume for when you got bored doing... whatever.

        Alex tried her best to keep a straigh face, she really did but 
her lips quirked up in a smile. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she started to say.

        Jasmine laughed, &quot;It really is a bit of a cliche, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 
Jasmine stepped in front of Alex, looking up at her with eyes suddenly 
dark with desire, &quot;But I do find I like it.&quot;

        Alex wanted to say something but her throat was suddenly tight. 
Jasmine stepped closer, reaching up to slip her hands under Alex&#39;s coat 
and gently sending the garment to the floor. She delicately undid the 
tie, running the cloth between her fingers before letting it slip to the 
ground.

        &quot;May I?&quot; Jasmine put her fingers on the top button of Alex&#39;s 
shirt.

        &quot;Please,&quot; Alex managed. She shuddered as she buttons were 
swiftly undone, revealing her small breasts uncontained by a bra. With a 
soft sound Jasmine pressed her lips to Alex&#39;s collar as she hands 
grasped each orb, teasing the already hard nipples with ease.

        Alex pushed Jasmine away as gently as she could manage, &quot;I want 
to see you.&quot;

        Jasmine kissed her, letting her fingers run through Alex&#39;s hair, 
messing it up a bit. &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask,&quot; she purred. With a 
delicate motion she slid one white glove down, then the other to reveal 
pointed, oddly shining fingernails. Jasmine turned and lifted her long 
violet hair away from her back to reveal a zipper, &quot;Could you?&quot;

        &quot;Oh yes,&quot; Alex took a second to kiss the back of Jasmine&#39;s neck, 
pleased to see her shiver. Then she grasped the tab and pulled downward, 
revealing a black bra and creamy purplish skin. &#39;Purple?&#39; Alex thought 
in surprise.

        The dress slid downward to the floor, revealing more of the 
purplish pattern running down her back. The bones of Jasmine&#39;s spine 
stuck out a bit more than normal, almost piercing the skin, and just 
above the rounded curves of her bottom a stub of a tail sat just above 
matching panties. She turned as she undid her bra, releasing breasts 
lightly tinted purple too and smiled up at Alex shyly.

        &quot;Is this all right?&quot; Jasmine asked, looking at Alex nervously.

        Alex drew her forward into another kiss, pulling her bare body 
close. &quot;You&#39;re beautiful,&quot; she murmured as they seperated.

        Jasmine stepped back to slip her panties off, tossing them at 
Alex as she sauntered to the bed, hips swaying and little tail wagging. 
&quot;Aren&#39;t you still a bit overdressed?&quot; she purred as she climbed up on 
top of the covers.

        Alex probably set a world speed record as she got out of her 
pants, panties, socks and shoes before climbing up onto the bed under 
Jasmine&#39;s admiring gaze. &quot;Like what you see?&quot; she asked her a bit 
nervously, wishing she had been working out a bit more.

        Jasmine surprised Alex by flipping her over, stradling the other 
woman. She licked Alex&#39;s ear, her long pointed tongue teasing gently 
then purred, &quot;Let me show you how much.&quot;

        &#39;This is going to be one hell of a night,&#39; Alex thought 
dreamily.</pre>
