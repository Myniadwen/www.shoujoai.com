<pre>July 30, 2012

            The first thing you should know is that although Carnegie 
University may be fictional, there are definite similarities between it 
and many other colleges around the world.  This is quite natural, since 
on the whole it is no radical campus, and nothing out of the 
ordinary-that is, beyond reasonable assumption and imagination-nothing 
incredible happens there, but amazing things still happen.  This 
university, which has so much in common with others of its kind, is an 
American school, run by a fairly diverse board of directions, and led by 
a Dean who has certainly seen her fair share of amazing things.  It is 
not beneath her to be attracted to something new.

            Carnegie University is a mid-sized campus; it&#39;s grown larger 
thanks to the generous endowment of its benefactor, for whom the 
founders bestowed its name (that is, old Andrew himself).  Its student 
body consists of some ten or fifteen thousand, and even though it&#39;s a 
young school, it&#39;s already proven itself worthy of recognition-but 
events will occur in the immediate future that will put Carnegie on the 
map and make it a truly famous institution.  It is because of these 
events that this story exists in the first place.

            The Dean of this school is similar to a government official.  
A board of directors elected her, and she has the ability to empower or 
refuse certain rules, schedules, edicts, and things of that nature.  In 
the near future, her decisions will directly determine the lives and 
livelihoods of several aspiring young women, and she will indirectly 
inspire many more.  Her greatest opponent was the Chairman of the board, 
a man who directly reported to her while still carrying enough power to 
overrule her decisions.  This man was the Dean&#39;s fierce political rival 
(so to speak), and he was one of the few people, ironically, she 
trusted.  To heed so carefully the words of one who always argued 
against her was truly an act of wisdom:  she definitely kept her enemies 
close.

            There is little to say about the faculty, which is fine 
considering the minor role most of them play:  they do their job, some 
better than others.  There is one eccentric among them who coaches a 
high school baseball team when he&#39;s not lecturing, and as unorthodox as 
he is (and a rather entertaining sight as well), he has led his team to 
victory and it&#39;s unlikely anyone will question his methods in the 
future.  The students call him Professor or Coach, or simply Sir, and 
the faculty and heads of the school call him Mr. Warren (his family and 
close friends give him other names).  He has actually seen adventures 
before, and his experiences carry through in his oddball wisdom.  He has 
a daughter attending Carnegie, and though she has little athletic 
prowess, it is her dream to be in a sports team one day, even if only on 
campus.

            Carnegie University is surrounded by a small city, with a 
public transit system to help students get between their classes and 
their homes.  The dormitories have been built with prudence in mind:  
students are usually housed based on the location of their classes, so 
there are no excuses for being late.  There are a number of good 
restaurants, malls, and offices in the area to encourage an influx of 
activity and economy.  There are also two hospitals (one just for the 
campus), four hotels, a museum, a handful of gas stations, garages, 
nightclubs, and a store for every conceivable desire, from books to 
movies to &quot;erotic necessities&quot;.  So on the whole, it&#39;s not very 
different from other schools.

            It was nearly the beginning of a new autumn term.  Summer 
was winding down, the beaches were being abandoned, and there were fewer 
fireworks in the sky, fewer moonlight strolls, fewer ice cream trucks 
and fewer excuses to use an air conditioner.  Enrollment was spiking; 
the board of directors was congested with requests.  Of course, those 
with the money were always welcome, but the real question was who to 
give a scholarship to, and who to turn down.  It was never an easy 
decision; Carnegie was becoming popular and more people wanted to 
attend.  The Dean anticipated most of these requests being funneled to 
her desk; the Chairman would no doubt scrutinize her every action.  
Andrew&#39;s original funding would see to it that many young minds were 
cultivated-just not all of them, unfortunately.

            &quot;The good news is that this year, we can be a bit more 
generous with our scholarships,&quot; said the Chairman, waving a thick 
folder in his hand.  &quot;We have so many people to thank for that.  But it 
also seems the old adage is true:  with more money come more problems.  
It&#39;s hard to believe, but some of the most gifted freshmen we&#39;ll receive 
don&#39;t have a dime to their names, and some of our richest students won&#39;t 
even be able to comprehend our beginner&#39;s courses.  It&#39;s a dirty joke.&quot;

            &quot;I haven&#39;t been summoned to discuss ethics, Fitzgerald,&quot; 
said the Dean.  They rarely agreed on anything but were always sure to 
be around one another, just in case.  &quot;You&#39;ve obviously given some of 
these requests more thought than others, and you&#39;d like my opinion.  I 
suppose that folder you&#39;re carrying has those names you&#39;ve favored.&quot;  He 
grudgingly gave them up to her trained eyes.  Chairman Fitzgerald didn&#39;t 
like the Dean, but he certainly trusted her:  they were both fierce 
professionals.  She looked through the list, approving of some, 
rejecting others.  A lesser man would lose his head after seeing so many 
promising students being discarded like that, but Fitzgerald studied her 
silently until the end.

            He sighed as he glanced at the pile.  &quot;That many?&quot;

            &quot;You said so yourself,&quot; replied the Dean coolly:  &quot;only 
those who will appreciate our instructions ought to be admitted.  Isn&#39;t 
that one of your core beliefs?  Those who have wealth can have whatever 
they want; they don&#39;t need an education.  It is the brilliant poor who 
need this aid.  You said that once before...or muttered it under your 
breath.&quot;

            &quot;It&#39;s really more your style, Rosewood,&quot; he replied, in a 
manner she expected.  She smiled.

            &quot;Perhaps we agree for once.  In any case, I&#39;ve put my sieve 
into effect and separated the applicants.  May I ask why you considered 
those others?&quot;  He shrugged cynically.

            &quot;Let&#39;s not fool ourselves, Rosewood.  Carnegie is not a 
charity, and if we&#39;re to have any real financial aid for these students, 
we&#39;ll have to bite our own tongues and accept these so-called purebreds.  
If they truly don&#39;t mind throwing around all that money, why stop them, 
I say.  They&#39;d be indirectly giving the real stars a boost anyway...and 
besides, what&#39;s a college campus without a little economic division?&quot;

            &quot;Indeed,&quot; she sighed bitterly, wielding a sharp smile.  
&quot;Well, I&#39;ll consider it as always, and it would be strange if we 
rejected someone who could afford to attend.  What about the ones you 
passed over?&quot;

            &quot;These?&quot; he said, waving the remnant of the requests.  It 
didn&#39;t escape Rosewood&#39;s eyes that this stack was considerably larger 
than the one she was holding now.  Fitzgerald was really more ruthless 
than she was; he cast off more people than she could even count.  He 
took in a deep breath and said, &quot;You can look at them if you want to.  
It might be nice to have a...second opinion.  Of course, in the end, the 
decision will come down to what the board of directors think.&quot;

            &quot;And what I say at the last moment,&quot; she countered.

            &quot;Or what I deem questionable,&quot; he retorted.  They stared at 
each other sharply, perhaps for seconds, perhaps for days.  Fitzgerald 
truly was Dean Rosewood&#39;s mightiest adversary, but she would rather lose 
an eye than see him retire.  There was no way she&#39;d ever recruit anyone 
that agreed with everything she said.  It wouldn&#39;t be intelligent...

            &quot;Then I suppose we&#39;ll have to wait until that time,&quot; she 
whispered thickly.

            &quot;You mean, we&#39;ll cross that bridge when we get to it?&quot;

            &quot;If that&#39;s what you want to call it.&quot;

            The room became silent again, except for the tick of a clock 
and muffled sounds of bird&#39;s songs.

            &quot;Very well, we agree again.  Maybe we shouldn&#39;t spend so 
much time together.  It&#39;s beginning to affect us both.&quot;

            &quot;But you bring such good company with you.&quot;  He bowed 
faintly and retrieved his belongings, leaving the scholarship requests 
behind.

            &quot;Good day, Rosewood.  I&#39;ll see you at the meeting.&quot;

            &quot;Yes, good day.&quot;

......

            No clear sign of autumn was yet in the air as Dean Rosewood 
strolled from her office into the meeting room for the board of 
directors.  It was a fine, bright day, and campus was largely empty, 
though there were groundskeepers, instructors wandering around taking in 
the nice weather, a few first-time students touring the facility ahead 
of schedule, and various employees who stayed at Carnegie year round.  
This was not the kind of day to sit indoors in a dreary room, going over 
business prospects for this year and what expectations everyone had, but 
it was Rosewood&#39;s duty, and if she didn&#39;t see to it, she would pay 
heavily for it.

            She noticed there were five other people in the room, so she 
wasn&#39;t early, and several more came in shortly after her, so she wasn&#39;t 
late either.  It was Fitzgerald&#39;s duty to cross through the doors last, 
to close them, and to officially begin the meeting.  There were a few 
snacks and drinks on a table, and polite chatter was already crossing 
the room.  Rosewood kept her ears out of it and focused on her drink, 
and on what she was going to spring on these people.  Carnegie finally 
had a surplus in its extracurricular activities budget, and today&#39;s 
meeting would mostly focus on how to invest that money.

            &quot;Good morning, everyone,&quot; came Chairman Fitzgerald&#39;s voice 
as he stepped through the doors and closed them.  He spotted the snacks, 
nodded with approval, and carried himself over there with the same 
everyday pride and dignity he always showed.  Keeping the board 
entertained with delectables wasn&#39;t mandatory, but he did push for a 
healthier selection.  Coffee and donuts were poor choices for an 
appetizer.

            &quot;Rosewood,&quot; he spoke to her as they sat down, &quot;if you would 
go over today&#39;s agenda, please?&quot;

            &quot;Yes.  As you all know, this small university has been 
created and supported by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of 
Teaching, and in the time between our opening ceremonies and this very 
day, we&#39;ve proven our academic prowess in spite of our obscurity.  We 
have more students enrolling for this semester than in all the previous 
semesters combined, largely in part to the contributions this board has 
given, and to all our hard work.  That being said, our first order of 
business is to determine which grants may be given to which students, 
and whom of the less fortunate we may still accept.  I also believe our 
extracurricular activities budget has a surplus, so we may finally add a 
new program to entice further students.  Chairman Fitzgerald and I have 
extensively debated on the former subject, and while we have not reached 
an agreement, I do believe we can make a compromise.&quot;  He smiled dimly 
and gestured.

            &quot;In the name of settling the matter and professionalism, let 
it be so.&quot;  They each laid their selections for potential candidates out 
for the board to vote on, and after a few minutes and some tense 
decisions, the choices were made and the destinies of many young men and 
women were decided.  It didn&#39;t escape the two rivals that an equal 
number of their choices had been accepted and declined:  the board knew 
of the deep friction that ran between them, and wanted to stay as close 
to a happy medium as they could.

            &quot;I approve,&quot; Fitzgerald concluded.

            &quot;I approve as well,&quot; Rosewood added.  &quot;Now we&#39;ll move on to 
the next order of business.  Please offer your suggestions for use of 
this surplus.&quot;  And so one by one, the members of the board stood up and 
made their sales pitch.  Most of their ideas were suggestions turned in 
by students and faculty, but a few were proposed quite selfishly.  
Somebody wanted to use that money to add an extra room for the library, 
while another called for a new campus store, and several were in favor 
of more parking spaces or an elective class.  Finally it came down to 
the Chairman and the Dean.  Fitzgerald stood up quietly and removed his 
glasses before he spoke, wanting to penetrate everyone with his deep 
blue eyes.

            &quot;All of these ideas are inventive and well thought-out.  
Perhaps someday in the future, maybe as early as next year, we&#39;ll have 
the budget necessary to implement everything.  But right now, we have to 
concentrate on what would be best for Carnegie-what would ensure us that 
we do receive that sort of funding.  In order to do that, we must become 
an outstanding school-not merely in academics, but in some other field.  
I propose the arts.  I propose a program dedicated to the study, 
appreciation, and performance of music.&quot;

            &quot;Do you mean a band, or an orchestra?&quot;

            &quot;I mean a music program.  We can have a band, or an 
orchestra, or both; it doesn&#39;t matter.  Art is just as important as 
academics; it crosses barriers and reaches generations like nothing 
else.  Art is timeless.  We will encourage creativity through this 
program, and if this board deems my proposal to be good enough, this is 
what we may use our surplus for.  There is already Carnegie Hall; let us 
be the path to that destination.&quot;  The board applauded, including 
Rosewood, and even began to favor it over their decisions.  Soon the 
attention was focused on the Dean, and she stood as humbly and quietly 
as her adversary.  There was no doubt that her plan would be just as 
significant as the Chairman&#39;s, and it would be hard to vote for only 
one.

            &quot;I agree wholeheartedly with Chairman Fitzgerald, which is, 
suffice to say, a change in my approach.  I daresay that in the end, the 
arts may be even more important than academics itself, for we as a 
species began expressing ourselves before we sought after knowledge.  
Regardless, the two inevitably go hand in hand, and it only makes what I 
am about to say even more difficult.  I might even support the Chairman, 
if we had the means to.  But I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll have to disagree again.  I 
am proposing we add a sports team.&quot;

            The reaction she got did not match the one given to 
Fitzgerald.  Most of the board was skeptical.  Fitzgerald buried his 
head in his arms and grumbled.  Rosewood understood their apprehension 
and decided to argue for her case.

            &quot;I already know what you are going to say.  We are a small 
college with no prior history of athleticism, and if we enter into this 
arena, we shall either be mocked and laughed at by the larger colleges, 
or else we shall be ignored completely.  It is one thing for a 
university our size to have a music department-it seems like a 
requirement these days.  We shall easily gain respect if we choose this 
path, and I have no doubt that we will draw the attention and admiration 
of many people.  But there is one advantage a sports team has that a 
music program does not, and that is the essential drive of the team 
itself, the focus of unity and community within a group, and the 
underlying need to overcome so many obstacles.  It is true that Carnegie 
must distinguish itself if we wish for it to have every advantage 
possible-not only the school itself, but our students and faculty as 
well-and for that reason, we shall distinguish ourselves not only as a 
small university that dares to have a sports team, but one that can 
compete on level ground with any other institute out there!&quot;

            She expected furious outrage, amazement, adulation, 
disbelief, shock, confusion, and despair all at once, but Dean Rosewood 
did not anticipate the frigid silence that followed instead.  The board 
of directors was not convinced, and had not been moved, and didn&#39;t seem 
to believe in her ideal.  She sat down peacefully and let them ponder 
over it for awhile.  Finally, somebody raised his hand.

            &quot;Uh, suppose your ideas were implemented, Rosewood.  What 
sort of team did you have in mind?&quot;

            &quot;A soccer team.  I wanted the sport to be universal, with a 
definite emphasis on the team, and popular enough that it would reach 
more people.  I had considered basketball, of course, but I think it&#39;s 
high time our younger generations found an honest attraction to this 
pastime as well.&quot;  Rosewood didn&#39;t dare reveal that her original goal 
had been to introduce a wrestling team to the school-and make divisions 
for both genders.  Having exceptional ideas was one thing, but she 
couldn&#39;t afford to be avant-garde:  her idea would instantly be 
dispelled.  At least now she had a chance.

            &quot;Well,&quot; Fitzgerald sighed, &quot;you were kind enough to praise 
my decision, so the least I can do is not insult yours.  I am completely 
against it, of course, but that&#39;s all I&#39;ll say.  Shall we put it to a 
vote, then?  All in favor of implementing a music program, raise your 
hand.&quot;  There were eleven members of the board, counting the Dean and 
Chairman, so all they needed was a 6-5 majority.  Fitzgerald held his 
hand up first, and four others followed.  Rosewood steadied herself and 
breathed deeply.  &quot;Now, all in favor of assigning our budget to 
Rosewood&#39;s suggestion?&quot;

            Oh, that magnificent weasel, she cursed inwardly.  He 
doesn&#39;t even have the courtesy to call it what it is.  Rosewood&#39;s 
suggestion indeed!  Her mental diatribe was wasted, though, as an 
astounding four hands rose from the silent gathering.  That left one 
vote undecided, and both contestants stared at the lone holdout as if 
their lives depended on it.

            &quot;Give a man a moment, now,&quot; he grumbled, clearing his 
throat.  &quot;Both your proposals are quite valid, and I understand your 
enthusiasm.  It&#39;s just like Chairman Fitzgerald said:  it&#39;s a pity we 
can&#39;t use this money on everything.  I only wish we could have both 
programs-then maybe you two might stop bickering so much.  But maybe 
happiness isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be.  Anyway, I&#39;m diverting from 
my intention.  Helmuth, old friend, can you solemnly swear that your 
musical program will lead at least one student to Carnegie Hall in the 
next four years?&quot;

            &quot;Sir, I&#39;ve learned long ago to be delicate with promises, 
wives, and glass, and I can at least assure you that this program will 
do all it can.&quot;

            &quot;Just the answer I expected from you,&quot; he nodded warmly.  
&quot;And you, dear Stacie, can you promise that within this same time 
period, your soccer team can win the national championship?&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ll do more than promise, sir,&quot; she answered confidently:  
&quot;I&#39;ll stake my position on it.  If my sports team fails, you can cut 
them away, erect your music hall, and find yourself a new Dean.  I have 
that sort of faith.&quot;

            &quot;Wonderful!&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;That&#39;s quite a gamble you&#39;re 
making, my dear, but I always did like a wager!  Well, Helmuth, she&#39;s 
being fair, isn&#39;t she?  I&#39;m sure that in four years, Stacie can prove 
just how beneficial this could be-and if not, you&#39;ve won, old friend!  
With risk comes progress, eh?&quot;

            &quot;But sir, you can&#39;t seriously be-&quot;  Fitzgerald was silenced 
instantly as the fifth and final vote was cast; he sat back in his chair 
and glowered.

            &quot;Give the lady a chance.  Four years is nothing, and from 
the way I see it, you have more to gain than to lose!  However, my vote 
comes at a steep price, Rosewood.&quot;  He stared at her firmly and touched 
her, ready to lay the heaviest of all burdens upon her shoulders.  
&quot;Soccer is a summer sport, if I&#39;m not mistaken, so that leaves you about 
ten months to find the best coach and the best players possible.  The 
surplus will provide you with equipment, and we&#39;ll provide our support; 
you just have to make sure they win.  It is your job on the line, you 
know!&quot;  He winked at her, and she smiled graciously.  Needless to say, 
the rest of that meeting was quite entertaining.

......

            Once the meeting had concluded, Rosewood made sure to thank 
her supporter one more time before heading out.  &quot;I have a weakness for 
wild dreams and desperate gambles,&quot; he admitted fondly, &quot;and besides, I 
honestly wanted to see Fitzgerald taken down a peg.  Oh, he&#39;ll do 
everything he can to hamper your progress, but I know you can do this.  
You&#39;ve already done great things with your life, Rosewood, and I know 
this won&#39;t be the last!&quot;

            &quot;No, sir.  I&#39;m still rather young, and I intend to live out 
the rest of my years performing many kinds of great services.  If you&#39;ll 
excuse me, sir, I would like to start recruiting my coaches.  I&#39;m 
starting a men&#39;s team and a women&#39;s team, and like you said, I&#39;ll need 
the best there is.&quot;

            &quot;Do you already have somebody in mind?&quot;  Stacie smiled 
mysteriously and waved farewell.

            &quot;Oh, I might.  Good day, sir.&quot;

            &quot;And you, Stacie.&quot;

Thus from humble beginnings may all things originate.
