<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 9 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>The rest of the school day was a blur for Kris. Before long she found 
herself back at her apartment. She leaned against the hall wall and slid 
along it into the living room where she found herself staring at the 
portrait of Jenn. Tears filled her eyes and she hugged herself tightly. 
It felt like her heart was going to tear out of her chest and bleed upon 
the floor. She longed to feel those lips again. To hold that warm body 
once more. Just to smell her scent. 

After a while she stumbled into the kitchen and dug in one of the 
drawers for a large kitchen knife. She stared at the long curved blade, 
then looked down at the scars on her wrists. It had only been a little 
over a year since she tried to join her beloved in the world thereafter. 
This time she didn&#39;t want to die. Just wanted to dig the pain out. She 
rolled up her sleeve revealing the numerous cuts that ran its length. 
She swallowed hard as she set the knife upon her skin. Her heart raced 
as she gripped the knife tightly. She clenched her teeth as the knife 
sliced through her flesh. The sight of blood forced the door in Kris&#39;s 
mind to slam shut. She dropped the knife into the sink and grabbed for a 
dish towel to stop the blood. Slowly the pain in her heart began to be 
replaced by the aching in her arm. It was almost a relieve to Kris. A 
strange comfort, a pain she was used to after all the years of abuse at 
the hands of her mother. 

She could handle all the physical pain the world could dish out, but the 
pain on her heart was something she wished to no end that she could take 
that same knife and dig out. She had considered it many times when she 
was younger. Whenever she was haunted by her feelings for girls. She 
even once placed the knife against her own chest with the plan to shove 
it in as deep as she could, but changed her mind at the last second 
unsure if she would just make a mess and have to suffer the wrath of her 
mother of getting blood on the sheet. She still remembered the beating 
she received the time she got blood on the carpet when she got her first 
period. She was forced to spend the night scrubbing the floors. She 
shook her head against the image. 

Thoughts of her mother always caused her to shiver in fear that the 
woman might one day return to finish her off. Once, before she met Jenn, 
Kris tried to kill herself by crashing her bike into a brick wall. She 
lost the courage at the last moment and fell off the bike. Her foot got 
caught in the pedals and she was dragged across the pavement, colliding 
with the wall. She thought for sure she would die there bleeding on the 
ground staring up at the sun. If a kindly couple had not been passing by 
she might have after all. They bandaged her up and took her home where 
she was sentenced to staying in her room without food for scaring the 
neighbors. That was all her mother ever cared about, what others thought 
of her insane child. Kris was like a dark secret that her mother wished 
didn&#39;t exist. More than once she heard her mother screaming at her 
father about how much she wanted to drop Kris off at an institution or 
academy. Kris sometimes wondered if her mother had a large grin on her 
face when she was taken to the hospital. Kris curled up in the corner of 
the kitchen. She remembered how her mother sometimes would tell Kris how 
she wished the girl was never born. Kris curled her legs up close to her 
and buried her face in her knees letting herself cry again.    

When Kris started to stir again she looked up to see that the sun had 
long since gone down plunging the apartment in darkness. She stretched, 
feeling the muscles in her back and neck complaining at her. She peeled 
back the towel to see that her arm had already begun to heal. For some 
strange reason she healed a lot faster than normal. She was kind of glad 
about this fact, because it meant that very few ever found out about her 
unusual knack for getting into &#39;accidents&#39;. Getting up she kicked off 
her shoes into a corner of the living room. Not bothering to turn on any 
of the lights as she began to strip off her clothes and head for the 
tub. Only when she reached the bathroom did she turn on the light and 
began to fill the tub with hot water. 

She watched the steam rise for a moment then turned to look at her 
reflection in the mirror. She could only see the pain that was deeply 
set into her eyes. The sight made her turn away from the mirror and shut 
off the water. She removed the last of her clothes and slowly slid into 
the steaming hot water making sure to leave her wounded arm on the edge 
of the tub. Her sore
muscles ached as they hit the water. It felt like she had just run a 
marathon. She crossed her legs under the water, lent back until her 
entire body was submerged, clenching her teeth against the stinging in 
her arm, then when the pain eased she let herself relax until her body 
came floating back to the surface. The amount of time that passed by 
while Kris lay in the water was unclear, nevertheless Kris didn&#39;t really 
care. She just let her body relax and let the worries seep away. She
crossed her arms behind her back, closed her eyes and let her mind drift 
to the happy memories of Jennifer.
