<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><pre>&quot;My mother is dead.&quot; Jennifer remarked coldly to the apparition that 
stood before her, &quot;Hell, she has been dead to me as long as I can 
remember.&quot; 

&quot;Oh really?&quot; May gave Jenn a sly smile, &quot;Is that how you really feel?&quot; 
She turned to face one of the washroom mirror, &quot;What if I told you that 
she was very much alive and missed you dearly?&quot; 

&quot;I would think you are nuts.&quot; Jenn crossed her arms, she was not sure if 
this really was May or not, but toying with her emotions for her mother 
was not the way to Jenn&#39;s heart and she was starting to get annoyed with 
May&#39;s persistence. 

&quot;Take a look.&quot; May nodded toward the mirror in front of her. 

Reluctantly Jenn moved away from the door to glance upon the mirrors 
surface. Before her very eyes she watched, as the mirror turned to water 
and the image within begun to shift and change, changing from a 
reflection to a window into another world. Beyond the mirror she could 
see the kitchen from her dream home and her mother. The woman rushed 
around the kitchen preparing dinner, &quot;Jenn, dinner is almost ready.&quot; Her 
mother called out and a slightly happier version of Jenn bounced into 
the room, &quot;Would you set the table?&quot; Her mother requested. 

&quot;Yep!&quot; The other Jenn readily hurried passed her mother and started to 
get some plates from the cupboard. 

Jennifer stared in disbelief at the images before her, &quot;That is from my 
dream, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She inquired warily. 

May wrapped arms around Jenn&#39;s waist from behind and set her head upon 
the girl&#39;s shoulder, &quot;It is only a dream if you want it to be.&quot; She 
explained softly, &quot;She is waiting for you. We are waiting for you.&quot; 

Within the mirror May entered the kitchen, &quot;Can I help?&quot; She eagerly 
asked. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; Jenn&#39;s mother smiled down at the girl, &quot;You can get the 
silverware alright?&quot; 

&quot;Kay!!&quot; May moved around the kitchen to the draw of utensils and opened 
it. 

Jenn shook her head against the image, &quot;This can&#39;t be real.&quot; She looked 
away to see that the other mirrors were also putting on an illusionary 
show. She peered within the one to her right to see an empty dorm room 
that she somehow knew was Tanya&#39;s room. The door opened and Jenn watched 
as Kris and herself entered the room, giggling and laughing. The two 
girls wrapped their arms around each other and leaned in close. 

&quot;I love you Jenn.&quot; Kris said lovingly as she ran her long fingers 
through Jenn&#39;s hair, &quot;I never want to be apart.&quot;

&quot;We never will.&quot; Jenn gave the girl a quick kiss upon the lips, &quot;We will 
always be together forever.&quot; 

&quot;Promise?&quot; Kris&#39;s lips hovered close enough to lightly touch Jenn&#39;s lips 
as she spoke. 

&quot;Promise.&quot; The two kissed deeply as they moved across the room and Kris 
lowered the girl to the bed, never breaking from the kiss.  

Jenn reached out to touch the mirror, &quot;This...&quot; Tears filled her eyes as 
the sensation of that kiss rushed through her body and mind, she could 
almost taste Kris&#39;s lips upon hers at that very moment and it made her 
lips quiver in hunger.

May quickly grabbed Jenn&#39;s hand and forced the girl to face her, &quot;That 
is not reality. It was a nightmare.&quot; She pointed to another mirror, 
&quot;Look what your wonderful Kris has been up to recently.&quot; 

Jenn glanced upon the mirror&#39;s surface to see the main lobby of the 
Western Dorms. At first Jenn was not sure what she was supposed to be 
seeing when Kris and Jessica entered the room. Jessica seemed to be hurt 
and Kris was helping her to the couches, and then Kris began to massage 
the girl&#39;s back. Jenn&#39;s heart raced at the sight, she told herself to 
turn away, to not look but she could not take her eyes off the image. 
She watched in disbelief as Jessica leaned into Kris and moved the 
girl&#39;s hand towards her pants, &quot;No...&quot; Jenn shook her head. &quot;She 
wouldn&#39;t...&quot; She placed a hand upon the mirror and observed in stunned 
bewilderment as Kris&#39;s hands slipped under Jessica&#39;s shirt and the other 
moved into her pants. Tears rolled down Jenn&#39;s cheek and she finally 
pulled her eyes away from the image. 

&quot;She never loved you.&quot; May whispered into Jenn&#39;s ear, &quot;She was always 
toying with you and now she has moved on.&quot; 

Jenn spun around to face May, &quot;You&#39;re a Liar!!&quot; She cried out. 

&quot;Am I?&quot; May inquired innocently, &quot;If so then why is there doubt in your 
mind. If you believed in Kris you would not be having such doubts.&quot; May 
lifted Jenn&#39;s hand up, forcing her to look at her wrists, &quot;Why do you 
think you did this? You knew she would leave you just like your mother.&quot; 

Jenn shook her head, &quot;No... no...&quot; She muttered not wanting to hear 
more. 

&quot;You knew she didn&#39;t love you.&quot; May&#39;s voice rose, &quot;You knew that you 
could never be together forever and that she was just filled with broken 
promises. You knew which is why you tried to end it all.&quot; 

&quot;No...&quot; Jenn was feeling weak, she wanted this torture to end, wanted to 
never see those images again.

&quot;Do you want this nightmare again?&quot; May inquired coldly, shaking the 
girl&#39;s arms. 

&quot;But...&quot; Jenn glanced from one mirror to another, each and every mirror 
in the room showed bits and pieced of Jenn&#39;s memories, a mixture of 
dreams, memories and fantasies. Jenn shook her head as her eyes moved 
from one image to another, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; She began to tremble 
then her eyes fell on one mirror that was darker then others. Inside 
Jenn could see a small library, another version of herself wandering the 
shelves, running her fingers along the spins of the many books. She 
pulled one book off the shelf and curled up with it on the ground with 
her back against the shelf. Slowly she flipped through the book, 
carefully taking in each and every page. Jenn tore her eyes away from 
the mirror to examine her wounds. 

&quot;Just give me the word and all this will vanish.&quot; May promised, &quot;The 
nightmares will finally end and you can live your life as you please. 
With me.&quot; 

Jenn stared at the girl, &quot;With you?&quot; This statement confused her; she 
took one last look at the mirrors and noticed something. One of the 
mirrors showed her walking down the school halls with Kris and in the 
background Jenn could distinctly make out May&#39;s angry face. She turned 
to another mirror to see that May was in the background of every image, 
glaring at her. Jenn suddenly realized something that she never 
considered before. All her life she remembered being concerned with 
hurting May and now gazing into those mirrors she noticed that May never 
cared about hurting Jenn. She was more interested in having Jenn to 
herself than Jenn&#39;s feelings. Jenn tried to recall why she was ever a 
friend with the girl. She could not even remember why anymore. Jenn 
suddenly turned back to May and pulled her hand away, &quot;You are not part 
of my world.&quot; She stated angrily, rubbing at her stitches, &quot;You lied to 
me to get me to come with you.&quot;

May&#39;s face twisted, &quot;I am part of your world.&quot; She insisted irately, &quot;We 
were meant to be together. Why do you think I came here?&quot; Her featured 
quickly softened and she reached out for Jenn, &quot;Please come back with 
me.&quot; 

Jenn glanced to the mirrors once more, now they showing moments between 
herself and May, moments of anger and upset altercations. Jenn&#39;s eyes 
fell upon one mirror that showed the reflection of the same room they 
now stood in. At first she thought that it was an ordinary mirror again 
when she noticed the refection of herself was wearing different clothes 
then herself and May was very much alive. In the reflection May moved 
closer to Jenn and wrapped her arms around Jenn&#39;s neck. Jenn suddenly 
spun around to face May, &quot;You kissed me.&quot; Jenn announced coldly, &quot;Right 
here in this room.&quot;

May staggered against the accusation. She rubbed the back of her neck, 
&quot;Well... I see... you are remembering then.&quot; 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Jenn stood up tall as her memories flooded her mind; &quot;You hated 
my relationship with Kris and all my friends. It was your jealousy that 
had been filling my heart with doubt over Kris and Jessica, hasn&#39;t it?&quot; 
She demanded, &quot;You have been in my head all this time trying to trick 
me. Trying to get me to kill myself again.&quot; 

&quot;You do not belong with that slut.&quot; May spat.

&quot;She isn&#39;t a slut.&quot; Jenn snarled, &quot;She loved me and I loved her, but you 
would never understand that. You were too busy thinking about yourself 
to care about how I felt.&quot; 

May&#39;s eyes darted around the room, &quot;I cared about you.&quot; The cuts upon 
May&#39;s wrists began to reopen and a trickle of blood ran down the girl&#39;s 
hands, dropping upon the floor, &quot;I loved you so much that it hurt to see 
you with that bitch.&quot; The blood was flowing freely now, coating her 
dress and legs, &quot;She would never treat you right. She would only hurt 
you more.&quot; 

&quot;What about you?&quot; Jenn snapped, &quot;I reject you, so you kill yourself. How 
do you think that made me feel? If you really loved me then you wouldn&#39;t 
have forced me to bury my friend. You are so selfish.&quot; She screamed, &quot;I 
hate you and wish we never met.&quot; 

&quot;But... I&#39;ve always loved you.&quot; May replied bleakly, &quot;You just never saw 
it. You were always starry eyed over that bitch. Why? What does she have 
that I don&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;A heart.&quot; Jenn stated bluntly, &quot;I have had enough out of you. I always 
tried to be nice to you but I see now that was the wrong thing to do. 
Leave me alone and never come back.&quot; She commanded. 

&quot;NEVER!!!&quot; May screamed, &quot;You belong with me and I will not let you go.&quot; 
Abruptly the mirrors shattered, sending shards of glass through the air, 
behind the glass tunnels of blackness could be seen. A howling wind 
rushed out of the tunnels, whipping the girl&#39;s hair about,  &quot;If you will 
not come back with me then I will make you.&quot; May howled in outrage. The 
wind quickened to a hurricane&#39;s pace, picking up the shards of glass as 
if they were simple leaves and sending them spinning through the air 
around the girl. 

&quot;May stop it!&quot; Jenn demanded, covering her face in an attempt to protect 
herself from the flying glass. A few fragments flew passed her, cutting 
at her arms and hands and she dropped to the ground and scrambled for 
the corner of the room in search of safety from May&#39;s wrath.

The shards began to gather around May and circle around the girl like a 
small cyclone of glass, &quot;You will come with me, Father demands it.&quot; She 
snarled, &quot;You will come with me if you want to or not.&quot;
