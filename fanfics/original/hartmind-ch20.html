<a href="../original/hartmind-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Sam awoke to find her two friends asleep in the same sleeping bag, arms 
wrapped around one another, and smiled at the image. She was thankful to 
see that Trish had finally overcome her issues with Beth and found 
someone to love her at the same time. Trish was slightly embarrassed to 
find Sam watching her as she awoke and even more so when she discovered 
Beth in her arms. She recalled the night&#39;s events and a nervous smile 
crossed her face. Sam probed her and Beth as to what happened while she 
slept, but neither girl would speak a word and laughed the more Sam 
insisted they give her details. The three of them spent the entire 
weekend together. They returned to Trish&#39;s home to gather some clothes 
and other things for the weekend and told Diana their plans before 
returning to Beth&#39;s place where they spent the day playing board games, 
watching movies and filling up on snacks. 

Sam never felt more alive in her life and was so happy that she came to 
Beth&#39;s place for the weekend. Beth filled Sam in on more details about 
Star, telling her stories about what the girl was like as a child, 
telling her everything she could think of would interest Sam, even 
brought out some more photos and the letters she had collected from the 
girl. The more Sam learned about Star the more she wanted to meet her. 
During those two days they put together a plan of how to get Sam and 
Star together again. 

It was decided that Sam should wait at least a year before she 
approached Star. She needed to wait until Star connected with Sam in the 
future or everything would go to hell. One slip up and Star might not 
get Sam&#39;s Meephit or have her mind linked to Sam&#39;s and it was that link 
that truly brought the two girls together, without it Sam would be just 
another girl and Star might run off, too scared to even make friends. 
Sam did not like the idea of waiting, but she understood. If she walked 
up to the girl too early she might change things in the past so much 
that she would forget her experiences with Star entirely, and she did 
not like that possibility. 

During the sleepover Sam made up her mind to return to school. If she 
was going to have to wait an entire year before seeing Star she might as 
well keep her mind busy or she would drive herself insane. During school 
Beth also helped her deal with her psychic abilities, teaching her how 
to block out certain feelings and during lunch hour they played a 
strange kind of game dealing with people&#39;s auras. Beth would ask Sam to 
pick out someone from the crowd and focus on the person until she could 
see their aura, without entering the person&#39;s mind. It was hard work, 
but if she was going to live with these powers then she would need to 
gain some control over them. Beth became a very close friend over the 
passing months, keeping at Sam&#39;s side during class change, making sure 
she didn&#39;t get too overwhelmed by the surge of emotions that filled the 
halls. She was even kind enough to bring by new letters that Star wrote 
to her, telling Sam all about the girl&#39;s life and what she was up to at 
that moment. Knowing that Star was indeed alive was like a large weight 
was lifted from her heart and she felt like she could finally live 
again. 

Beth and Trish became closer with every passing day. They would sit 
beside each other during lunch and Trish tried to follow Beth&#39;s lessons 
for Sam, asking a question every now and then. They went out on many 
dates, sometimes going out alone and others staying over night with Sam. 
Sam sort of felt like a third wheel and was embarrassed by this, but 
both girls insisted that she come a long at times and Beth teased that 
she could bring Star along when they met up and they could go doubles in 
the future. The notion of four of them going out together made Sam flush 
and she truly hoped it would be possible, but kept in mind that things 
might not work out between her and Star, as well as they have been for 
Trish and Sam, but she kept a small amount of hope in her heart. 

Diana was more then happy to see her daughters so happy. She could see 
the changes in both girls and even inquired of Trish as to her 
relationship with Beth. Diana was very nice to Beth, inviting her over 
for dinner every now and then. She only warned the girl that she should 
be careful and not to go too quickly. She did this in front of all three 
girls, making sure that even Sam understood that she loved her as much 
as Trisha and wanted them to come to her if they ever needed. 

She was more of a mother to Sam then her own mother ever was. The court 
hearing involving her parents divorce happened in the late months of 
winter and Sam was nervous that she would be called in to testify 
against her mother. She had to talk to a number of psychologists about 
the issue and how it all made her feel. She was scared out of her mind 
of her mother&#39;s wrath and wished that she could just stay with Diana and 
Trish. Diana accompanied her to every one of the meetings and comforted 
her through some of the hardest times in her life. The doctors assured 
her that she would not have to go onto the stand, but the more 
information she gave the safer it would be for her, for they would make 
sure her mother could not even have visit her again.  

The only sad change to her life involved Lisa. Upon learning about Trish 
and Beth&#39;s dating she suddenly changed her attitude and became very 
vicious towards the girls. She called them names and said they were 
disgusting, insisted that Sam never speak to the girls ever again. When 
Sam explained that she too liked girls Lisa threw a fit in the middle of 
the lunchroom, throwing her tray of food at Sam and screaming at her, 
tears streaming down her face. Then she ran off and never returned to 
their group. Sam occasionally saw the girl in the halls but was only 
greeted with a middle finger or the girl screaming, &quot;Dyke&quot;, in her face. 
This saddened Sam slightly, but she realized that she would have to deal 
with something like this sometime in her life and she refused to allow 
Lisa to destroy her happy feelings. She needed to think of Star at that 
moment and she didn&#39;t have time to deal with the girl&#39;s immaturity. 

Over the months, between studies, the three of them planned what they 
were going to do about that final dreadful day. They all agreed that 
they couldn&#39;t confront the man or they might end up dead themselves, and 
what would that accomplish? Sam kept her eyes on the newspaper, looking 
at every photo of wanted criminals in search for someone who looked 
familiar, only to find nothing. Beth probed Sam&#39;s memories of that last 
day in search for any information that might help them, what time was it 
when Star entered the house, where exactly was Star&#39;s mother laying, was 
the door unlocked, and so much more. It was very stressful for Sam, but 
she tried her hardest to recall every last gruelling detail. As the 
school year began to crawl to an end she was started to get frustrated 
and afraid that she wouldn&#39;t be able to save her friend after all. 

Then one day near second semester exam time Beth came running up to Sam 
and Trish at their lunch table. She had stopped painting her face white 
and trimmed her bangs back during Christmas, but her hair was still dyed 
black and pink and still wore her trademark black attire and silver 
earrings. Trish gave the girl a quick kiss before Beth turned to Sam, a 
serious look upon her face. 

&quot;We have trouble.&quot; She stated worriedly, she held a letter shakily in 
her hands.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sam inquired worriedly. 

Beth slid in next to Trish, across from Sam, and put the paper on the 
table in front of Sam,  &quot;I just heard from Star and it is not good. Her 
father was released from the hospital and was seen around her place. Her 
mother is packing up their things and moving again.&quot; She said while 
franticly poking at the piece of paper. 

&quot;Where too?&quot; Trish inquired, already knowing the answer. 

Beth pointed at the new address on the page, &quot;Recognize this?&quot; She asked 
tapping the page before her. 

Sam starred at the address in shook and glanced up at Beth, &quot;Are you 
sure about this?&quot; She inquired uneasily. 

Trish breathed, &quot;This can&#39;t be possible... that&#39;s...&quot; She glanced 
between the two girls, &quot;Sam&#39;s old place...&quot;
