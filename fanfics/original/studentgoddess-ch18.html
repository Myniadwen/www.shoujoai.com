<a href="../original/studentgoddess-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>  &quot;You think I would remember all this stuff,&quot; Erin murmured, cupping her red cheeks. Faye 
just laughed and moved a strand of hair out of her face. &quot;You&#39;re still the same as back 
then, just a little more talkative.&quot;

      Erin sighed and looked at Faye. &quot;I... We got a lot closer didn&#39;t we, because...&quot; 

***** 

      Because sometimes Erin went To Faye&#39;s temple. Actually, it was because the red head 
specifically invited/forced her that she went. When she arrived, Posh-Posh slithered off her 
shoulders and immediately went to find Faye.

      She smiled to herself. Erin never thought that she and the Goddess of Love would have 
such a relationship. &quot;Oh, Posh-Posh! If you&#39;re here, then,&quot; Faye said, walking out into the 
hallways holding the snake. She smiled upon seeing Erin there.

      &quot;So you finally came to visit? Come with me,&quot; She gingerly took Erin&#39;s hand and led 
the other goddess to the dining room in her temple. Faye set Posh-Posh on the ground before 
taking a seat at the table. Erin soon sat herself and watched as servants brought in an 
array of food. &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; Faye said kindly and the women bowed before leaving.

      &quot;They&#39;re quite adorable, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Faye asked, biting into an apple. &quot;...what do 
you mean?&quot;

      &quot;Oh, humans... they&#39;re so fragile and easily swayed, but we&#39;re part human too aren&#39;t 
we? I enjoy being able to help them like this. It&#39;s a wonderful relationship that the gods 
have with humanity, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Erin thought to herself before replying to Faye. &quot;Yes, you&#39;re 
right. It&#39;s our duty to see to their happiness and all we ask is for their prayers. It is 
rather fulfilling.&quot;

      Faye smiled and took one of Erin&#39;s hands into her own. &quot;But, right now, all I want to 
think about is you.&quot; Erin blushed, but squeezed her hand. &quot;...alright.&quot; Faye giggled and 
leaned in to kiss her on the forehead. &quot;So many things about you... the way you act... how 
shy you get... I love them all.&quot;

      Erin flushed bright red at her words, but let out a happy sigh as Faye kissed her on 
the lips. Neither of them noticed the questioning looks they got from the servants in the 
hallway. 

***** 

      For years, they remained intimate, never taking the next step, but... Faye was lying 
on her grandiose bed, Erin lying on top of her. The Goddess of Serpents was comfortable 
lying on Faye&#39;s bosom while the Goddess of Love was stroking her dark green hair.

      Suddenly, Faye turned them over so she was on top. She leaned down and placed her lips 
upon Erin&#39;s mark. The snake goddess started to sigh and moan as Faye nibbled and suckled at 
the delicate flesh. The red head started to kiss her passionately and Erin did nothing to 
resist. It was... wonderful... the kiss escalated and Faye found her hands starting to work 
their way into the folds of Erin&#39;s robe, hoping to caress the delicious skin beneath.

      Erin watched, breathless, as Faye pulled the neckline of her clothing down and started 
to kiss her collarbone. Faye looked at her with smoldering eyes before leaving her 
collarbone and going to nibble on her ear. &quot;Erin...&quot; she breathed out, &quot;I&#39;ve taken so many 
to my bed, but... I&#39;ve never been so excited and anxious before.&quot;

      It was after she spoke, that Faye found herself being pushed away by a flushed Erin. 
The dark haired woman wordlessly got off of the bed and started out the door. &quot;E...Erin?! 
Where are you going? Erin!&quot; But the snake goddess was already gone.

      Faye stared at the doorway, confused. Erin had... seemed so willing, but then she just 
walked out? She put a hand over her heart and felt a pain deep inside of her. Even if she 
was the Goddess of Love, this was the first she&#39;d ever experienced... actual love.

      Had she been too needy? Or gone too fast? Maybe Erin just wanted to be intimate 
friends...? She didn&#39;t want to be her lover...? Faye buried her face in her pillow and cried 
herself to sleep that night. 

***** 

      It was the next day when Faye went on a frantic search for Erin. Well, it wasn&#39;t that 
frantic since she was pretty sure the other woman was at her temple attending to her duties 
as a goddess. Faye walked down the pathway in the courtyard, determined to fix whatever 
problem they had.

      She asked one of the many servants where Erin was and they said she was in her 
chambers. Faye let out a sigh before continuing inside the temple. It was much different 
than her own, but since she&#39;d been inside it so often, she knew exactly where Erin&#39;s room 
was.

      The snake goddess almost suffered whiplash as Faye came storming into her room. &quot;Wh... 
what are you doing here?&quot; She asked, coldly, looking away. Erin was sitting on her bed, 
looking through a book of some sort.

      Faye just stared at her. &quot;I came to see you,&quot; she said, shutting the door behind her. 
&quot;I want to know why I upset you...&quot; Erin didn&#39;t look at her. &quot;Please leave. I believe we 
come from two different worlds of thinking, you and I, so I don&#39;t think this will ever work 
out.&quot;

      She could believe Erin just said that. &quot;What are you talking about? Last night... I 
was just... I just wanted-&quot; Erin cut her off. &quot;Just what? I... I don&#39;t want to be another 
name on your list - someone you can play with and then toss away like everyone else.&quot;

      Erin shut the book and looked straight at her. &quot;To you, everyone is your toy. Maybe 
you have changed for the better, but old habits can never be erased. You&#39;ve had so many 
lovers that I doubt you even hold such acts as important.&quot;

      That&#39;s why she was mad... because Faye mentioned how many she&#39;d slept with. &quot;If your 
name were to be on this list... I would want it to be the only name... the last name on it.&quot; 
Erin looked at her, slightly confused. &quot;I know I&#39;m supposed to be the Goddess of Love, but 
this is the first time I&#39;ve ever been in love.&quot;

      Erin looked away awkwardly. &quot;Faye... I...&quot; She just continued speaking, sitting down 
on the bed. &quot;I would never stop loving you Erin; I would never toss you aside or treat you 
like a plaything. I want to be with you, always...&quot; She tenderly cupped Erin&#39;s cheeks and 
looked right into her yellow eyes.

      &quot;But... what if I... what if I&#39;m not good enough...?&quot; The snake goddess said and Faye 
could see all the fear and insecurity in her eyes. &quot;That... doesn&#39;t matter. Do you love me?&quot; 
Erin swallowed. &quot;Yes... I love you for who you are... not because people can be charmed by 
your or because your beautiful. I love you because... because... my words can&#39;t describe 
it.&quot;

      Faye smiled kindly. &quot;Then that&#39;s all that matters.&quot; She kissed Erin and soon the two 
would-be lovers found themselves tangled on the bed. After quite a few kisses and caresses, 
Faye presumptuously disrobed and was rewarded with a blushing Erin. The snake goddess&#39;s eyes 
locked on to the mark on Faye&#39;s left breast, right above her heart.

      &quot;...that&#39;s where your mark is...?&quot; Faye nodded and let one finger caress Erin&#39;s mark 
on her neck. &quot;Yes... it&#39;s right over my heart.&quot; Erin blushed as Faye grabbed her hand and 
made her touch it. Faye&#39;s bosom was warm. The snake goddess tore her hand away, looking down 
into her lap, embarrassed. &quot;...Erin... if you aren&#39;t ready for this, we can do it another 
time. I want the moment to be perfect.&quot;

      Erin wrapped her arms around Faye&#39;s naked waist. &quot;This moment is perfect...&quot; She 
murmured before kissing Faye&#39;s mark intimately. The red head let out a sigh and the two fell 
over onto the bed. 

***** 

      &quot;Oh... wow,&quot; Erin said, her face bright red. &quot;I remember that...&quot; Faye smiled kindly 
and caressed one of Erin&#39;s cheeks. &quot;That was an amazing night... though I found it strange 
that you were never attracted to me because of my beauty. Even now, you don&#39;t find me 
attractive.&quot;

      Erin shook her head. &quot;No... I find you attractive - er, I mean... you&#39;re attractive 
not because of your looks, but because of all the time we spent together... that I still 
can&#39;t remember clearly.&quot; Faye pouted.

      &quot;D-don&#39;t worry; I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll remember soon!&quot; 

***** 

      Krystal and Isaka exchanged looks. They were currently hiding in a shadow near the 
pair. &quot;I told you my gaydar picked up Erin as a lesbian...&quot; Isaka murmured. Krystal sighed. 
&quot;Alright... I lost our little bet...&quot;

      &quot;So, you&#39;re going to wear the special outfit tonight, then?&quot; Krystal just kissed 
Isaka. &quot;I would have worn it anyways, seeing as how you rescued me.&quot; 

***** 

      Faye opened her eyes and stared at the ceiling. That night was... the best night of 
her life. She looked to her side to see Erin curled up against her, still sleeping. They 
were both nude, but the red head was enjoying the caress of Erin&#39;s skin against her own.

      Who knew the snake goddess was so... so... Faye grinned like a fool at the thought. 
They had made love... that was the first time she had ever really had intercourse with a 
person she loved. It was wonderful! Brilliant! Everything else she had done now seemed 
insignificant... Love... Even though she was the goddess of it, it had taken her until now 
to realize how great it was.

      She kissed Erin on the top of her head and watched in delight as she started to stir. 
Tired yellow eyes looked into her happy teal ones. Erin was blushing a bit at Faye&#39;s smile. 
&quot;Erin... you were amazing. I don&#39;t understand how apprehensive one like you could be. That 
was... love is so wonderful! I love you so much and don&#39;t you dare think I&#39;m ever going to 
let you get away,&quot; she said, hugging Erin fiercely.

      &quot;I... I was really that good?&quot; Erin asked, wide eyed. Faye laughed. &quot;Of course! I know 
this may be a bit strange to ask, but... how many lovers have you had before? Please don&#39;t 
take offense to my question...&quot; Faye had to guess she had quite a few in the past...

      Erin mumbled something, but Faye couldn&#39;t hear it. &quot;What did you say Erin?&quot; The dark 
haired woman looked away, her face red. &quot;You... are my only one.&quot;

      Faye froze in shock. Erin was a virgin. Or had been. The snake goddess started to 
shrink away from Faye, seeing her shocked look, but the red head&#39;s face soon softened into 
one of happiness. &quot;You... allowed me the privilege to be your first?&quot; She asked quietly and 
Erin nodded. Faye kissed her gently and pulled her into a hug. &quot;That makes me so happy.&quot;

      Erin sighed and nuzzled into Faye&#39;s bosom. &quot;I want to be with you forever, Faye...&quot; 
The red head nodded and they soon drifted off into sleep.
