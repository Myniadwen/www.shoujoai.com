<pre>Author&#39;s Notes
==============
Hey there Thanks for choosing Neo Comet Swordsman Saizaki for your 
reading needs. First off I&#39;d just like to say a few things. This story 
is a continuation of a previously (unfinished) story I wrote called Neo 
Comet Swordsman Setsuya. If you want a better feel for this &#39;new world&#39; 
then I suggest you read that first, but it&#39;s not completely needed to 
enjoy N.C.S : Saizaki. This series was inspired heavily by the fighting 
games, Guilty Gear, Toshinden and Evil Zone. It also contains quite a 
few historical/religious/mythological references, such as quotes from 
the Bible, places and weapons named after Celtic Gods, etc No offence is 
intended by this, and I highly doubt that those who are religious in 
anyway would be. But I think it&#39;s necessary for me to give you the 
head&#39;s-up on these little details. Well, that&#39;s about all. Enjoy!

Neo Comet Swordsman Saizaki:
War of Magics 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

&quot;Now have come the salvation and the power and
the kingdom of our God,
and the authority of his Christ. 

For the accuser of our brothers,
who accuses them before our God day and night,
has been hurled down. 

They overcame him
by the blood of the Lamb
and by the word of their testimony;

They did not love their lives so much
as to shrink from death.

Therefore rejoice, you heavens
and you who dwell in them!

But woe to the earth and the sea,
because the devil has gone down to you!

He is filled with fury,
because he knows that his time is short.&quot; 

- Revelation 12:10  &quot;The Woman and the Dragon&quot;

AGE OF MAYHEM

2050: The world reached a new age of prosperity and peace. All conflicts 
were resolved by creating a unified group of every country around the 
earth. The World Federation The whole of the Earth is united in 
celebration at the beginning of world peace and the dawning of a new 
era, free of suffering. But then the order of things is disturbed. By 
freak accident or by destiny, a gigantic meteor which would come to be 
known as the &#39;Genesis Comet&#39; crash-landed into the planet. From the 
following destruction, an estimated 78% of the human race is wiped from 
the face of existence. Science and technology as we know it is 
irreparably  injured, sinking the world into depression and mayhem. 
 
2053: The governments of the (Neo) World Federation decide that the few 
remaining countries left standing will be reinforced with magical 
barriers. This became known as the Safe-Zone Project.

hosts a tournament (Ten-sekai sentou kyousou) in order to draw in all 
wielders of the four sacred swords.

2082 (January 1st): The tournament takes place. The Four Sacred Swords

tournament. The world sees the destructive power of the sacred swords, 
and they are immediately sealed away, never to be used again.

&quot;In the time of my favour I heard you,
    and in the day of salvation I helped you.&quot;

Prologue

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral, London, Neo-England

It was a magnificent place. Once. St. Paul&#39;s Cathedral. Many years 
before the landing of the Genesis Comet, this was once a hub of the 
spiritual beliefs and cultures of a happy English folk, oblivious to 
that which was about to befall them

The once revered hallowed arches, cavernous halls and echoing chapels 
were collapsing into the dust of their creation. It seemed humbling to 
those who came here. To know that a holy place which stood for 
righteousness was beginning to crumble. To the solitary man standing 
inside the main chapel, it was fitting. With the waste of St. Paul&#39;s 
Cathedral, came in turn the waste of the beliefs holding the world back 
from his personal brand of &#39;salvation&#39;.

This man stood silently. But the quiet chapels could not contain or undo 
his power. Though he appeared nothing more than a frail old man, his 
wrinkled flesh tarnished with age and his long hair bitter with 
greyness, there was something about him. His clothes, a fine set of 
robes beaming the colours gold and black, were clearly Arabic in design. 
Even though Arabic nations had been some of those that were destroyed by 
the Genesis Comet. The old man&#39;s beady eyes held more than just age. 
They held wisdom. The wisdom that comes with seeing both the beautiful 
old world and this newer, impure and ruined one. 

This man was currently the most powerful magic-user known to mankind. 

He was Al Gul Jehed. 

Al Gul looked around the cathedral slowly. Observing the many symbols of 
the old England&#39;s faith. The cross, mainly. Christianity had always been 
important to this country. It, at times, decided England&#39;s fate. But no 
more. The people of this nation had turned away from religion in their 
thousands, all due to their disbeliefs and disenfranchisement. It was 
understandable to Al Gul Jehed though. Human beings were fragile. As 
long as they have something to bow down to, they feel safe. Insecurities 
so strong, they force noble people to touch their foreheads to the 
earth. In praise of a saviour they cannot see nor feel nor touch.

Al Gul Jehed touched his hand to the gold cross in front of him. It was 
covered in dust from years of neglect. &quot;Perhaps the insecurities of 
mankind made them to turn to magic after the comet. But now technology 
is beginning to rise again... human beings wish to cast aside the 
magic-users that helped them... and we are shunned as filth.&quot;

An echoing female voice called out from behind Al Gul Jehed. &quot;...Human 
beings love power. But loath those who wield it. That is the only reason 
magic-users are so feared today.&quot;

Al Gul turned around slowly, casting his pale green eyes to the woman 
behind him. He would know that voice from anywhere. Because it belong to 
a woman, deathly important to him That woman was Diana Angelinous, 
beloved of the late Zephaniah. She was beautiful Her white-blonde hair 
framed her sweet oval-shaped face brilliantly, highlighting the sea of 
sapphire blue that made up her eyes. And her beauty was not the only 
thing that made Diana special. Her powers of magic were limitless. It 
was no wonder that Al Gul Jehed had made this woman his apprentice. But 
if you took a deeper look into her eyes, and saw beyond the beauty, the 
strength, you would see nothing but unhappiness. 

&quot;Diana...&quot; The old wizard spoke. &quot;What news from the battlefield?&quot;

That was the reason she came. &quot;Our armies have been successful. 
Neo-Germany is almost ours. All that is needed is to eliminate the 
remaining forces that resist us there.&quot;

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Al Gul asked. 

&quot;The Order of Light,&quot; Diana took a breath, then continued &quot;Their troops 
have a stranglehold on the city of Munich and the surrounding provinces. 
It is safe to assume that the sealing temple of the four sacred swords 
is hidden around that area.&quot;

Al Gul Jehed smiled to his prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. &quot;I see. You are wise to make that 
assumption. The Order of Light is not so tenacious that it would risk 
healthy soldiers to protect a simple city. The shrine at which the 
swords have been sealed... must be near Munich. I want you to use all 
possible resources to find those swords, Diana. Neither the Neo World 
Federation nor the Order of Light must ever lay their hands upon those 
blades. Not when we are this close to victory.&quot;

Diana nodded, then crouched to her knees, bowing in respect. &quot;I 
understand, sir. I have already ordered Esperanza to follow the 
movements of the soldiers stationed around Munich. She will strike at 
first command. Then she will begin the search.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Al Gul turned from Diana back to the cross On it was a carved 
picture of the broken body of Jesus, the man who met his destiny upon 
the cross. Al Gul Jehed&#39;s eyes then flashed brightly and in seconds, 
that cross was burning in flames. &quot;I have decided to make this place our 
new base of operations.&quot;  

&quot;Here?&quot; Diana said sceptically. &quot;But this place is so-&quot;

Al Gul finished that sentence for her. &quot;Dilapidated? But that is the 
beauty of it, Diana. There is purity within destruction. And it is only 
through destruction that new things can be born. This place will be a 
symbol of our power. When the Covenant of Sorcerers finally seizes 
control over the earth... this place will stand for our success.&quot;

Al Gul Jehed then turned his eyes to the image of the burning cross. &quot;It 
will represent the death of one dynasty, and the birth of a new one. A 
dynasty that will belong to all those who carry magical lineage.&quot;
