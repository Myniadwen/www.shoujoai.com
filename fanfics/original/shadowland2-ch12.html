<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 12 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>&quot;Why does this keep happening to us?!?&quot; Kim exclaimed frantically. They 
now stood in complete darkness with only the door before them, their 
hands not leaving the doorknob for fear that they would tumble into the 
abyss below their very feet. 

Kima swallowed hard as she tried to conceal her fear, &quot;I don&#39;t know. But 
it looks like we only have one choice left and that is to open this 
door.&quot;

Kim shook her head violently, &quot;I don&#39;t want to!!!&quot; She whimpered, &quot;That 
creature could be there. Or Akaime!!!&quot; She pulled the door shut tight 
not allowing her twin to open it. 

&quot;Akaime is dead!&quot; Kima returned, &quot;We made sure of that and that creature 
from our room is only in our room. This isn&#39;t one of our nightmares.&quot;

&quot;How do you know that?&quot; Kim cried, &quot;It could be our room behind that 
door. It wants to finish us off.&quot;

Kima had to admit to herself that it was a possibility. Then the waltz 
drifted to her ears once again and she smiled, &quot;It can&#39;t be our room. 
Since when did we listen to a waltz?&quot; She inquired knowingly. 

Kim had to think for a moment, &quot;Never... but...&quot; Her hand relaxed on the 
doorknob as she tried to think of some other reason for them to not open 
the door. 

&quot;Then there are no more complaints.&quot; Kima stated and pushed the door 
opened. 

&quot;No Wait!!!&quot; Kim screamed out, but it was already too late. The door 
swung wide open and a heavy wind battered at the girls. Kima grabbed 
Kim&#39;s hand and pulled her through the door. The moment they passed the 
threshold the door slammed shut behind them with a heavy thud. 

They now stood in a small, dimly lit, cellar with walls of concrete that 
had been stained by water that must have seeped in during the winter 
thaw with two long narrow dust-filmed windows set near the ceiling to 
provide a small amount of light. Aloft I-beams could be seen 
crisscrossing the open ceiling and small fragments of light peeked 
through cracks in the floorboards every now and then. There was also the 
faint odour of fungus that attacked Kima&#39;s senses causing her to sneeze 
slightly, the sound echoing off walls, startling Kim. Suddenly the sound 
of heavy footfalls filled the air as someone walked overhead and Kim 
clamped her hand to her ears in an attempt to block out the horrendous 
sound while Kima wrapped her arms around her double in an attempt to 
calm the girl, trying even harder to conceal her own fears. Slowly she 
ushered the girl to the back of the basement, behind a stack of old 
mouldy boxes, being sure to keep one eye on the ceiling overhead, 
tracing the foot steps as they crossed overhead.

&quot;Penny, I can&#39;t believe you at times.&quot; A voice called out in the dark as 
the creaking of a door raced down the stairs alone with a square of 
light that spill out across a set of rickety wooden stairs, &quot;Get down 
there and I don&#39;t want to see you until you straighten your act up.&quot; A 
young girl came tumbling through the door, her foot missing the first 
two steps and her arms pin wheeled as she tumbled down the stairs. She 
managed to brace herself with her arms as she landed head first upon the 
next set of stairs and slid to the bottom, landing in a heap. &quot;And I 
don&#39;t want to hear no crying out of you either.&quot; The door slammed shut 
plunging the girls back into gloomy darkness. 

Kima squinted against the dimness, trying to get a better look at the 
newcomer. The girl was clad in a brown one-piece dress that comes down 
to about mid calf; her small socks had a hole in the toe, her hair was a 
tangled mess and there was dirt all over her body. She silently tried to 
stifle her sobs when the air suddenly filled with the sounds of the 
waltz. Kima searched the ceiling for the source of the sound. When she 
could not find it she turned back to the girl. She considered crawling 
towards Penny but was afraid of frightening her. How would she explain 
how two strange girls ended up in Penny&#39;s basement? Also she didn&#39;t know 
what she would do with Kim and didn&#39;t want her twin causing too much of 
a fuss as to disturb whomever lived upstairs. 

That was when Penny slowly got to her feet; her eyes were closed so she 
didn&#39;t seem to notice the two redheads. She gracefully spread out her 
arms in front of her, then placed one upon the hem of her dress and gave 
a slight curtsy. She smiled as if someone were talking to her and then 
opened her arms to invite an invisible person into them and began to 
dance across the floor. Kima found herself mesmerized by the girl&#39;s 
grace as she glided across the floor, even with her eyes shut the girl 
did not bump into any of the random boxes that lay askew around the 
cellar floor, slowly Kima found herself being drawn to the strange 
dancing girl. She could not take her eyes off the girl as she got to her 
feet; it was as if she was being gently pulled into the dance.

Kim became frantic by her twins movements and pulled on the girl&#39;s arm 
in protest, too afraid to speak. Kima broke free from the scene before 
her for a moment to glance down at her double, shook her head at the 
girl and place a finger to her lips.

Cautiously Kima turned back towards Penny and let go of Kim. Careful to 
avoid bumping into Penny as the girl danced around, Kima walked around 
the girl until she was standing to the back of her and tapped her 
lightly on the shoulder. Penny opened her eyes slightly and was faintly 
startled, but a smiled played across her face as Kima bowed deeply and 
extended a hand towards the girl. Penny took Kima&#39;s hand with a slight 
curtsy and the two girls continued to dance throughout the dim basement 
as if they were standing upon the floor of a grand hall. 

Kim shook her head in disapproval and leaned against the wall with her 
cheek resting upon her hand in boredom. She could not understand how her 
double could approach a girl without a single ounce of hesitation; it 
was as if her twin had no common sense. Always thinking with her heart 
and not her head. Kima mussed over this when she noticed Kima was 
drawing ever so much closer to Penny and they both seemed to be 
surrounded in a strange glow. 

Kima gently pulled Penny up against her body and wrapped one hand around 
the girl&#39;s waist; she was close enough to smell the scent of the girl&#39;s 
hair, a mixture of dust and flowers. She found herself being pulled into 
the girl&#39;s large green eyes and didn&#39;t even notice as her surrounding 
began to change around her. All around the basement faded away to reveal 
a grand ballroom hall, the hall was oblong with towering mirrors 
staggered between tall marble pillars all around a large yellow marble 
dance floor. In front of each pillar stood tall brass candelabra with 
its many ornamental candlesticks aglow. At one end of the dance floor 
was an elevated promenade deck with two grand stairways running along 
the walls to both side and marble railing encircling it. A magnificent 
set of double doors stood open at the far walls beyond the promenade 
where many guests could be seen entering the room in pairs while at the 
opposite end of the hall large white curtains could be seen draping to 
either side of a huge set of glass windows with a door in the middle 
that led out to a balcony. The ceiling arched high overhead and coming 
together in the centre. Stings of crystal looped down from the ceiling 
like an illusionary upside down fountain spraying its waters into the 
centre where they gathered into an immense chandelier. 

The dance floor itself was filled with people dancing gracefully about; 
each dressed in elegance and class, with masquerade eye masks upon their 
faces. Before Kima&#39;s eyes Penny&#39;s dirty and tangled hair melted away to 
be replaced by the most beautiful wavy brunette hair held up by many 
beads and gold strings with small foil leaves. Her tattered dress 
transformed into a flowing gown of golden yellows and whites that 
drifted around the girl&#39;s feet and a matching feathered eye mask covered 
the girl&#39;s face. 

Kima caught a glimpse of herself in one of the tall mirrors as they 
danced passed it. She looked very gentlemanly in her own opinion, decked 
out in a fancy red tux and white gloves. Her own eye mask was blood red 
with dark marking around the eyes and adorned with colourful feathers 
over the right eyebrow. She was still admiring herself when she felt 
Penny cling to her tightly. She returned her gaze to the girl to find 
Penny was not looking back at her; instead they were staring over Kima&#39;s 
shoulder. Kima gracefully spun the girl around to see what had caught 
Penny&#39;s attention. 

Across the hall a large man dressed in a stark white tux and long 
flowing white cloak fluttered behind him as he strolled through the 
crowd of dancers. As he passed people by they stopped dancing and 
stepped to the side of the dance floor while muttering to themselves. 
Kima could not tear her eyes from the man as he approached the two 
girls. A mask as black as the finest ebony covered his entire face and 
no eyes could be seen while strains of wavy white hair fell around the 
edge of the mask making it seem more like the man had no face at all. He 
abruptly stopped before Kima and Penny and the girls stop their dance, 
but did not break from each other arms. Penny clung to Kima even more 
tightly as the man glanced from one girl to the other and then reached 
out his hand towards Penny. He was about to take hold of her arm when 
Kimberly suddenly rushed out onto the dance floor. 

&quot;Get away from him!!!&quot; Kim screamed as she ran across the dance floor. A 
blood red gown flowing around her and ruby mask upon her face, &quot;Kima!!! 
It&#39;s him!!! The man that took Lauren from us!!&quot; She cried out. 

The man spun around to face Kimberly, &quot;You...&quot; A snarl could be heard 
from under his mask as he turned to face Kim, who suddenly tripped on 
her dress and slide across the ballroom floor. 

&quot;Drake.&quot; Kima growled at the man. She spun around and grabbed hold of a 
large brass candelabrum from near the wall, &quot;Leave this place!&quot; She spun 
the candelabrum around and slammed the bottom of it against the side of 
the man&#39;s head causing him to fall to the ground and slide across the 
polished floor. He quickly got to his feet to face his new adversary, 
the mask now cracked revealing one of his cold dark eyes. 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; He pointed at Kima, &quot;What are you doing here? You do not 
belong.&quot; He declared.

Kima slammed the candelabrum down on the ground with a heavy clang, &quot;You 
are the one that doesn&#39;t belong. Get out of here.&quot; She commanded 
pointing to the ballroom doors. Kai suddenly came charging through the 
doors clad in a noble uniform of blacks and gold trim and rushed up to 
the promenade&#39;s marble railing. Six angelic wings spread out to their 
full width behind the girl and the air filled with the sounds of awes 
from the crowd as they caught sight of the girl. 

&quot;A Sister...&quot; Drake hissed under his breath. He quickly spun around and 
headed for the patio doors.

Kai leaned over the railing, her hawk like yellow eye scanning over the 
crowd, when they noticed Drake. She leapt up onto the railing and 
sorrowed through the air and landed in front of the man, blocking his 
retreat. He turned to search for another means of escape when Kima 
started to circle around him with the two other girls as her side and 
candelabra in hand. 

&quot;Get out of here.&quot; Kima demanded grasping her weapon firmly with both of 
her hands and pointing the candle end at the man. 

&quot;I see...&quot; Drake remarked looking between his two opponents, &quot;If that is 
how the game is going to be, then...&quot; He grasped the edge of his cloak 
with his hand when he noticed Alyson come running onto the dance floor 
in a tux and top hat, a black sword cane in hand. A sinister smile 
crossed his face; &quot;We&#39;ll continue this later.&quot; With a wave of his cloak 
he disappeared leaving only the piece of cloth in his place. 

&quot;Come on.&quot; Kai started towards the ballroom doors, her wings folding up 
behind her, &quot;We should be leaving too.&quot; 

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Kima inquired cautiously, still holding the candelabra in 
hand. 

Kai spun around to face the girls and gave a slight bow, &quot;I am Keelia, 
sister of Aigneis, who you might know better as Kris.&quot; 

Kima set the candelabrum down, &quot;Kris... Then you are an angel of death?&quot; 

Kai nodded, &quot;I don&#39;t have long to explain, we must get out of here 
quickly.&quot; She insisted.  

&quot;Alright.&quot; 

Kima started to follow when Penny grabbed her by the sleeve, &quot;Don&#39;t 
leave me fair prince. There most be something I can do to thank thy for 
saving me from that dastardly man.&quot; She pleaded.

Kima turned to the girl, &quot;There is no need for thanks. Consider the 
dance thanks enough.&quot; She took a deep bow. 

&quot;Come on Romeo.&quot; Kim tugged on Kima&#39;s tails, &quot;At least you didn&#39;t kiss 
the gi-&quot; She began to mutter when Kima abruptly pulled free of Kim&#39;s 
grasp and wrapped her arms around Penny.

&quot;Maybe a kiss would be reward enough.&quot; Kima remarked with a grin.

Kim rolled her eyes, &quot;Why would she...&quot; Penny placed her lips upon 
Kima&#39;s and softly kissed her. Kim blinked at the scene before her, &quot;This 
can&#39;t be for real.&quot; She mumbled in disgust of her doubles actions, and 
then turned to follow the angel out of the ballroom, Alyson following 
right behind them. 

Kima stepped back from Penny and placed a soft kiss upon the girl&#39;s 
hand, &quot;Hope to see you again, my dear.&quot; She spun on her heels with a 
slight flare and ran after her friends.

The moment the girls passed through the doors the ballroom melted away 
and they all found themselves standing in the dorm hallway. Kima glanced 
at Alyson, &quot;Where did you come from?&quot; She asked puzzled over the girl&#39;s 
appearance. Then she noticed a bruise across the girl&#39;s forehead, &quot;Are 
you alright?&quot; She inquired concerned. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Alyson half admitted and rubbed her head. &quot;Don&#39;t worry 
about me.&quot; She turned around to gaze upon the door they had just passed 
through, &quot;What happened?&quot; She asked.

&quot;A crack formed between worlds.&quot; Kai stated nonchalantly as she turned 
to the door and placed a hand upon it. &quot;I think the flood has slowed for 
now. This place seemed to be filled with cracks. I should have my 
sisters look things over sometime.&quot; She let her wings fade away. 

The lights around them started to flicker to life and the door opened, 
&quot;Who... who is there...?&quot; The quiet voice of a young girl asked. The 
door opened further to reveal Penny standing before them clad in a long 
white nightgown and rubbing her eyes. She scanned the many faces that 
stood before her in bewilderment, &quot;What... what are you all doing 
outside of my room?&quot; She asked nervously. 

&quot;Penny?&quot; Kima pushed passed her twin to approach the girl and took her 
hand, &quot;It is I. Your prince.&quot; She smiled at the girl. 

Penny&#39;s eyes grew wide and her jaw bobbed open. She glanced from one 
girl to another recognizing each of them from her dream, then started to 
wobble and fainted dead away. Kima was just in time to catch the girl 
before she hit the ground. 

Kai shook her head, &quot;Smart move.&quot; She patted the redhead on the 
shoulder, &quot;Smooth.&quot; She felt something from within the room and stepped 
around the two girls to get a better look around. It was a single room 
unlike most of the dorm rooms, which housed two girls, and was set in 
the corner of the dorm as such it had windows running along two of the 
walls and a door to a small washroom in the far corner. A small bed was 
sat under the window and there was a dresser covered with stuffed 
animals against the far wall. 

Kai approached the dresser, her eyes scanning the many plush animals. 
She clutched her fist causing her tattoos to jump to life and yellow 
flames started to crawl across her skin. Abruptly one of the teddy bears 
in the back row sprung to life and jumped from the pile. With a wave of 
her hand the air filled with fire and the teddy ignited. It let out a 
banshee&#39;s wail as it toppled to the floor on fire. Quickly the flames 
ate away at the bear as it tried to crawl to the window. Kai approached 
the creature and prepared to step on it when the teddy sprung from the 
ground. It leapt for Kai&#39;s face, long claws extending from what used to 
be soft cloth paws. Part of the fur had peeled away from its face 
revealing a dark mass with a glowing red eye. Kai stared at her attacker 
unmoving, she swiftly she grabbed the bear by the neck with her flaming 
arm. Fire crawled across the creature and turned the thing to ash. Kai 
let the remaining bits fall to the ground and stomped out the last fiery 
embers.

Alyson entered the room and stared down the twitching remains of the 
bear paw, &quot;A Bugbear? But how?&quot; 

Kai quickly turned on her feet and brushed passed the girls, &quot;Come on.&quot; 
She commanded, &quot;And bring that girl with you.&quot;
