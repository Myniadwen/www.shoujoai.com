<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/hartmind-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Trish&#39;s mother told them they could stay the entire weekend if they 
wished, simply happy to hear Samantha was getting out of the house 
finally. Trish told her mother that they would see how the night went 
and if things go well they may stay longer, if so they would return for 
some clothes and tell her all about their night at Beth&#39;s. Diana agreed 
and told her to have fun and Trish gave her mother Beth&#39;s number, as 
Beth spoke it out for her, before hanging up and telling the girls that 
the slumber part was on. 

They spent the night watching movies that Beth owned, some horror movies 
and some vampire flicks, while curling up in a couple of sleeping bags, 
Beth planning to sleep in her bedroom while the two sleep in the living 
room, and talking about every thing from school to who else they thought 
was gay at school, Beth telling them if they were right or wrong. Before 
long the sun had faded away and so did Sam. Trish leaned over her friend 
and smiled down at the girl&#39;s sleeping face. 

&quot;She&#39;s fast asleep.&quot; She whispered to Beth. 

Beth looked at the girl&#39;s sleeping form and grinned, &quot;She looks so 
peaceful.&quot; She said softly, &quot;I can see why you fell for her.&quot; 

Trish&#39;s smile twitched and she rubbed the back of her neck in 
embarrassment, &quot;I can&#39;t remember how many times I watched her sleep like 
this.&quot; She admitted sheepishly. 

Beth looked at the girl seriously, &quot;I&#39;m sorry she can&#39;t return your 
feelings.&quot; She said sincerely. 

Trish brushed Sam&#39;s hair out of her face, &quot;That is alright. As I said I 
figured this would happen. I&#39;m just glad to see her smiling again. 
Thanks to you, thank you for everything you have done for her.&quot; 

&quot;No problem.&quot; Beth returned nonchalantly. 

Trish slowly stood up and felt slightly wobbly, needing to grab the wall 
to stable herself, &quot;Maybe I had too many of those coolers.&quot; She admitted 
with a soft giggle. 

Beth lifted up an empty bottle and looked at the small drop inside, &quot;You 
only had six or seven. This is your first time isn&#39;t it?&quot; She inquired 
with a sly smile. 

Trish did not notice the smile as she nodded and held her head, &quot;Woah... 
I need to go to the washroom. I&#39;ll be right back...&quot; She slowly moved 
down the hall, passed Beth and her mother&#39;s room, to the washroom. 

Beth rolled over on her back as Trish left the room and stared up at the 
ceiling. She had several coolers herself, but was not feeling the 
effects as of yet. She kept to light liquor as the heavier stuff tended 
to send her powers out of control and she didn&#39;t need another incident 
like that first time. Even though she still wasn&#39;t feeling the drinks 
she was feeling something and she cursed herself for it. She bit down 
upon her lower lip as she tried to control the raising feeling that had 
been building up inside of her since she pulled Trish behind the 
portables at school. She could feel the coolers had weakened her control 
over her urges and was afraid that if she did not keep herself in check 
she may end up kissing the girl before the night was out and she did not 
want to scare the girl off so soon after she started warming up to her. 

She knew that Trish didn&#39;t have feelings for her at that moment, but she 
could see that the girl was at least noticing her now, unlike when they 
first met. She wanted so badly to get to know Trish, and felt ashamed of 
using Sam to get closer to the girl. She just did not have the strength 
to walk up to Trish and tell her how she felt. She had told herself 
before the school year began that she would keep her heart under 
control, but she couldn&#39;t help herself. There was just something about 
Trisha that she could not explain. She rolled over again to glance down 
the hall at the light under the washroom door and quivered at the 
thought of the girl using her washroom. She shook her head of the 
thoughts that tried to invade her mind and sat upright, taking several 
deep breaths in an attempt to clear her mind. 

Unable to get her head in check she got to her feet and moved to the 
balcony where she quietly opened the sliding glass door and stepped out 
onto the cool cement ground and looked out over the city. The sun had 
descended long ago leaving a star filled sky hanging overhead. There 
were no clouds so the moon provided enough light for Beth to see the 
park below the, the trees creating long shadows in which animals most 
likely played. She breathed in the cold night area and allowed it to 
clear her head. She took a couple more breaths when she heard someone 
moving through the blinds behind her and spun around to see Trish 
standing on the balcony, staring out at the city. 

&quot;Wow...&quot; She breathed as she gazed out at the sea of stars, &quot;It&#39;s 
beautiful.&quot; She approached the railing and glanced down to quickly back 
up again, &quot;God, we are high up.&quot; She said in a panic. 

Beth rushed to the girl&#39;s side to steady her, lowering Trish to a 
plastic garden chair, &quot;Easy there.&quot; Her hand touched the girl&#39;s bare leg 
and for the first time she noticed that Trish had removed her pants. Sam 
had removed her pants before curling up in the sleeping bag and Beth 
figured that must have been the girl&#39;s plans after returning from the 
washroom she was just ready to find the girl sitting before her with no 
pants on. She quickly removed her hand and forced herself to look the 
girl in the eyes. &quot;Calm down, there is nothing to worry about.&quot; She 
assured the girl, as well as herself.  

Trish held her hands in her head, &quot;I feel dizzy. I forgot we were so 
high up.&quot; She said shakily.

Beth knelt next to the girl and place a hand on Trish&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Do 
you want me to help you back inside?&quot; She inquired concernedly. 

Trish nodded, &quot;I hate heights.&quot; She stated miserably, &quot;Sorry...&quot;

&quot;Its quite alright.&quot; Beth insisted as she took Trish by the arm and 
slowly helped her to her feet, &quot;Don&#39;t look over the railing.&quot; She warned 
as she stirred the girl away from the edge, &quot;Just look at me.&quot; She said 
carefully luring the girl back towards the balcony door, &quot;Easy there, 
watch your step.&quot; 

Trish did as she was told, however tripped as her last foot passed 
through the door and stumbled into Beth, and they both tumbled onto a 
beanbag chair, giggling and shhing each other. Beth found herself pinned 
under Trish, but didn&#39;t mind the feeling. She swallowed hard as she 
realized that they were nose to nose together and she could feel that 
growing urge inside of her even more then before. 

Trish brought a hand up to Beth&#39;s face and brushed a hair from the 
girl&#39;s face, &quot;You really are beautiful.&quot; She said in awe, &quot;I was such an 
idiot not to notice it before.&quot; She lowered her eyes in shame of 
herself.

Beth flushed, &quot;Now the coolers really are talking. You don&#39;t mean that.&quot; 
She lightly pushed at the girl&#39;s shoulder. 

Trish leaned in closer to the girl, &quot;I do mean it.&quot; Her lips lightly 
brushed against Beth&#39;s and Beth could not hold back any longer. She 
wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s neck and kissed lightly upon the 
upper lip. Trish did not recoil and returned the kiss. Tongues slipped 
between lips as the two girls slipped into a passionate kiss. Beth could 
feel their saliva moving between their mouths and lightly ran a hand up 
the back of Trish&#39;s shirt, causing the girl to softly moan. She could 
feel the softness of her cotton panties and this made her shiver in 
delight. She broke free from the kiss to gaze into Trish&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I want you.&quot; She breathed, her hand running along Trish&#39;s side, under 
her bra strap. 

Trish suddenly sat up on the girl&#39;s lap, a bright flush covering her 
entire body, &quot;You what?&quot; Trish asked perplexedly, unsure if she heard 
the girl correctly. 

Beth sat up and pulled Trish&#39;s legs around her waist, running a hand 
along her bare skin of her legs, &quot;Make love to me.&quot; She pleaded, lightly 
kissing the girl on nap of the neck. 

Trish squirmed at the sensation of the girl&#39;s lips upon her flesh and 
glanced down at Sam&#39;s sleeping form, &quot;But what about Sam?&quot; She inquired 
worriedly. Surprised to hear herself saying such a thing. Not putting a 
stop to things, but just worrying about her friend hearing them. 

Beth looked down at their sleeping friend and down the hall, &quot;My room.&quot; 
She insisted, forcing Trish to stand and taking the girl by the hand. 

&quot;I... I&#39;m not sure about this...&quot; She said nervously, suddenly aware of 
what she had just agreed too, &quot;I&#39;ve never...&quot; She flushed again. 

Beth opened her bedroom door and pulled the girl inside, &quot;You have 
masturbated haven&#39;t you?&quot; She bluntly asked, closing the door behind 
her, leaving only the light of the moon to guild their way. She stepped 
up to Trish, wrapping an arm around the girl while her other hand slid 
under the front of the girl&#39;s shirt and along the band of her panties. 

Trish swallowed hard, &quot;Well... yeah... but...&quot; Trish&#39;s protests were cut 
off by another intense kiss from Beth that made every part of Trish&#39;s 
body quiver with anticipation of more. Beth&#39;s hand moved under her 
panties and touched pubic hairs causing Trish to quickly back up and 
nervously wiped at her face with her hand and swallowed again, &quot;Are you 
sure about this?&quot; Trish stammered ever so slightly, &quot;I mean, don&#39;t you 
want to wait until it is someone you love? Some who really loves you?&quot; 

Beth stopped and stared at Trish with a mixed look of confusion and 
grief, &quot;You don&#39;t want me?&quot; She asked woefully, &quot;I thought you said I 
was beautiful.&quot; 

Trish reached out to take the girl&#39;s cheeks in her hands, &quot;You are 
beautiful and I think I could love you, but I want to get to know you.&quot; 
She explained firmly, &quot;Right now I want to be there for Sam and I want 
my first time to be something beautiful and not rushed.&quot; 

Tears splashed over Beth&#39;s eyes and ran her mascara down her cheeks, 
&quot;What are you saying?&quot; She asked in confusion. 

Trish rubbed the back of her neck, &quot;I think I&#39;m saying I want to date 
you first. If that would be alright with you?&quot; 

&quot;You mean like girlfriends?&quot; Beth inquired hesitantly, &quot;Real 
girlfriends?&quot; A nervous smile crossed her face.

Trish nodded, &quot;If you want to date someone who is in love with their 
best friend that is?&quot; 

Beth smiled and hugged Trish tightly, &quot;I would like that.&quot; She whispered 
into the girl&#39;s ear, tears steadily streaming down her face. 

Trish backed up slightly and smiled at the girl, &quot;Want to watch another 
movie together?&quot; She asked with a nod to the door. 

Beth nodded and picked up a Kleenex from a box on her dresser and then 
got a look of herself in the mirror, &quot;Shit I look horrible.&quot; She said as 
she dabbed at her eyes. 

Trish smiled, &quot;No you don&#39;t. Why don&#39;t you wash up while I pick another 
movie? Anything you want to see?&quot; She asked as she led the girl into the 
hall and towards the washroom. 

&quot;You choose.&quot; Beth suggested and then spun around to give Trish another 
quick kiss on the lips, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Beth said as she disappeared into 
the washroom. 

Trish lightly touched her lips and smiled. This was her first kiss and 
it was wonderful. She suddenly realized that she had a girlfriend and 
skipped down the hall to the living room where she picked through the 
tapes in search of what to watch.
