<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 18 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/artemis-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Amaterasu smiled as she took a spot at the bar, the
saucy looking redhead as tall as any woman there and
matching a few guys too. &quot;Hey Circe,&quot; she nodded
respectfully as she put some coins on the bar.

&quot;Hey,&#39; Circe smiled back, the ancient sorceress clad
in skintight leather from top to bottom. The blonde
poured her usual drink and passed it over as she
cheerfully asked her, &quot;So how&#39;s business been?&quot;

&quot;Pretty good, actually,&quot; Amaterasu said as she took
her first drink, &quot;in fact, I&#39;m tempted to tell Jess
Drake to put me on speed dial, she calls so often.&quot;

&quot;You are the most reliable driver in the city,&quot; Circe
acknowledged, &quot;and it helps that you know about all
the supernatural stuff too.&quot;

Amaterasu looked amused at that comment as she said
dryly, &quot;Considering my background, it&#39;s
understandable.&quot;

With perfectly unaccented Japanese a voice said,
&quot;Hello, Amaterasu-sama. It&#39;s been a long time.&quot;

&quot;Athena!&quot; Amaterasu whiled around in her chair,
reaching out to thump the other woman on the shoulder.

&quot;Hey, watch your strength,&quot; Athena laughed warmly. She
studied the other woman, &quot;What&#39;s a good goddess like
you doing in a place like this?&quot;

&quot;Gee, that&#39;s nice,&quot; Circe muttered, shaking her head
wryly.

Amaterasu snickered softly, &quot;I just sort of fell into
bad company.&quot; She took a drink, &quot;Though I suppose it&#39;s
more due to the whole migration thing.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Athena nodded as she said, &quot;one of your
especially devout mikos left Japan and you followed?&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Amaterasu nodded in agreement as she
explained, &quot;and I found America quite interesting, so
I stayed.&quot;

&quot;I suppose it doesn&#39;t effect your worshipers wherever
you are,&quot; Athena noted that a bit enviously. Amaterasu
was a contemporary goddess, held in reverence in Japan
as part of their Shinto beliefs, unlike Athena and the
Olympian pantheon.

&quot;Yes and no,&quot; Amaterasu looked a bit sheepish, &quot;I
notice I have a hard time speaking in the formal mode
my older worshipers expect now.&quot;

Circe smiled, shaking her head as she left the two
goddesses to chat. In truth she was more than a little
tense, with the reports of violence they were getting
from the city. &#39;And Descent and Sam are both out
there,&#39; she thought.

&quot;They&#39;ll be all right,&quot; the tawny haired woman said
gently as she returned to the bar, balancing a tray
full of empty mugs on one hand.

&quot;You sure, Diana?&quot; Circe asked as she relieved her
lover of the tray then gave her a lingering kiss on
the lips.

Diana smiled gently. &quot;They&#39;re both hunters and good
ones,&quot; she said firmly, &quot;they&#39;ll do well today, I
think.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Circe conceded as she loaded up the tray with
refills and new orders. She frowned as she confessed,
&quot;I just wish we could go out there and help them.&quot;

&quot;Not a potion,&quot; Diana sighed, &quot;not if we want to keep
the Daughters neutral in the city&#39;s various gang
wars.&quot;

&quot;I know, but I don&#39;t have to like it,&quot; Circe sighed as
Diana hurried off.

&#39;I wonder if she realizes how we&#39;ve both changed over
the years?&#39; Diana mused as she hurried to drop off
drinks for customers, &#39;There was a time neither of us
would really have cared about the troubles in this
town.&#39;

&quot;Ho, beer over here,&quot; a sandy haired young woman
waved.

&quot;Hi Rio,&quot; Diana nodded, careful to not bump the
woman&#39;s wheelchair as she set the bottle down on the
table.

&quot;Busy night?&quot; Saxon asked, the black haired woman
sitting with her friend at the romantic corner table.

&quot;Two of our staff aren&#39;t available,&quot; Diana sighed, &quot;a
last minute thing.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s got to be hard,&quot; Rio agreed. She looked over
at her companion with amusement, &quot;Sax, didn&#39;t you bus
tables when you were younger?&quot;

&quot;Maybe I did,&quot; Sax laughed, &quot;but I think I&#39;ve outgrown
it.&quot;

&quot;Drat,&quot; Diana chuckled, then excused herself to serve
another customer.

Rio drank from her beer, smiling slightly as she
looked over at Sax thoughtfully. &quot;You don&#39;t look much
older than when I first met you at Bette&#39;s party a few
years back,&quot; she finally said with a grin.

Sax chuckled softly, &quot;I blame my good looks on clean
living and bathing in virgin&#39;s blood every full moon.&quot;

&quot;Old, very old,&quot; Rio snickered.

Sax raised her glass in a silent toast and drank.
&quot;So,&quot; she asked after a moment, &quot;am I being a good
date so far?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d give you a nine out of ten so far,&quot; Rio conceded.
She looked at Sax curiously, &quot;Why did you agree to
this blind date?&quot;

&quot;Why did you?&quot; Sax countered with a grin.

Rio swirled her drink around a moment, &quot;My friend said
you were entertaining and cute. Besides, I don&#39;t get
out as often as I used to.&quot;

Sax smiled back warmly, &quot;Well, my friend said you were
lovely and charming, both of which were true.&quot; Gently
she asked, &quot;Are you seeing anyone?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ve been single awhile,&quot; Rio looked away
uncomfortably.

Sax reached out to place her hand over Rio&#39;s, &quot;I&#39;m
sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have asked.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; Rio smiled gently, the woman looking
younger than her thirty years. Only the few lines
caused by pain and stress aged her, the lasting marks
of rehabilitation and healing. She took a breath, &quot;My
longtime lover broke up with me shortly after this
happened.&quot; She gestured towards her legs and the
wheelchair.

Sax frowned, &quot;That&#39;s pretty despicable of her.&quot;

&quot;Not really,&quot; Rio shook her head as she tried to
explain, &quot;I think I always knew she was basically
unreliable.&quot;

&quot;Still, it&#39;s low,&quot; Sax said firmly. She looked at Rio
thoughtfully, &quot;Is she why you haven&#39;t been dating
either?&quot;

Rio looked at her in surprise, &quot;You really are well
informed.&quot;

&quot;We both know Lucy Yamazaki,&quot; Sax noted, &quot;a private
investigator who&#39;s almost habitually nosey. Where do
you think I get all my information from?&quot;

&quot;Heh, good point,&quot; Rio conceded. She looked
thoughtful, &quot;I don&#39;t think my breakup is the main
reason I haven&#39;t been dating.&quot; She slapped the arm
rest of her chair, &quot;Recovery has taken up a lot of my
time.&quot;

&quot;Good excuse, too,&quot; Sax gently teased.

Rio gave Sax a thoughtful look, &quot;And what about you?
When Lucy was convincing me to go with you she almost
made it sound like a pity date.&quot;

&quot;Pity date?!&quot; Sax looked offended.

Rio had to grin, &quot;Yeah, I understand Rose and Lucy
have nicknamed you Dateless.&quot;

&quot;Remind me to have my revenge on them later,&quot; Sax
grinned back. She sipped her drink, &quot;To be honest, I
think I just got tired of it all.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Rio looked curious.

Sax looked vaguely embarrassed, &quot;I used to get around
quite a bit in our community...&quot;

Rio smirked, &quot;You were a slut.&quot;

&quot;I wasn&#39;t that bad,&quot; Sax blushed. She looked off into
the distance, &quot;But after a while, I realized all the
conquests didn&#39;t mean so much to me.&quot;

&quot;I see,&quot; Rio said quietly. She studied Sax a moment
then smiled as she asked, &quot;Do you really want to go
out again?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Sax answered promptly. &quot;It&#39;s actually kind of
nice to go out with someone who has no expectations.&quot;
A grin, &quot;And who forgives my being a slut.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to have to live down using that word,
aren&#39;t I?&quot; Rio asked wryly.

&quot;Yup,&quot; Sax answered promptly.

&quot;Well, I hope you&#39;ll give me at least a few dates to
manage that difficult task,&quot; Rio offered just a bit
nervously.

Sax patted her hand, &quot;As many as you need.&quot;</pre>
