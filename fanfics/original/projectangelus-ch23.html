<h1>Project Angelus (part 23 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>      Mina&#39;s phone began to vibrate as a loud, jovial tune played from it. It was ignored 
until the sounds caught the attention of those in the room.

      &quot;Solomon? What is that?&quot;

      &quot;I suppose it&#39;s a phone.&quot;

      Pandora looked at him before going back to the dress she was sewing. Solomon took 
that as his cue to grab the loud object and see exactly what was going on. He walked over 
to a table where a neatly folded set of clothes lied with a small backpack next to it. The 
phone was vibrating on the table next to the belongings.

      &quot;Eveon is calling,&quot; he stated with a smile, looking at the ID screen on the phone.

      &quot;Is she?&quot; Pandora smiled as she started to add details and unique alterations to the 
dress. &quot;How cute...&quot;

      When the phone stopped ringing, Solomon turned off the volume so it wouldn&#39;t disturb 
them again. &quot;I guess we should answer it,&quot; Pandora said, &quot;But then we would ruin the 
surprise.&quot;

      Solomon turned his attention instead to the girl lying on the table, wearing only her 
undergarments. She&#39;d just been bathed, but he was more interested in the way her hands were 
twitching.

      &quot;Solomon, you are wonderful,&quot; Pandora gushed as she set the dress aside. &quot;I&#39;m so 
excited to have Eveon&#39;s girlfriend!&quot;

      She&#39;d been so happy to see him when he came back with the frightened girl that she 
didn&#39;t even bother introducing herself before inducing Mina into a trance.

      &quot;I&#39;m glad you like her. I will be sure to go grab Eveon soon...&quot; Solomon trailed off 
as he continued to watch Mina struggle silently on the table.

      Pandora started to notice the slight movement and giggled. &quot;How adorable... she&#39;s 
trying to break my spell! When was the last time someone moved?&quot;

      &quot;One of the more recent ones did before the pianist... I think he rolled himself off 
the table,&quot; Solomon commented.

      &quot;Oh, yes! Now I remember! He almost hurt himself doing that...&quot; Pandora now had a 
mask in front of her. &quot;What should I paint?&quot;

      Solomon took the time to think before suggesting, &quot;Something that has a twin design? 
That way, Mina and Eveon can have similar masks.&quot;

      &quot;You are so creative,&quot; Pandora said happily before drawing a wing on the mask. &quot;Then, 
Eveon can have one just like it!&quot;

      Pandora hummed to herself as she brought the dress over to Mina. &quot;She&#39;s so pretty, 
isn&#39;t she?&quot;

      &quot;Indeed,&quot; he said. &quot;Do you need help dressing her?&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t be silly! Eveon might get upset to know a boy was dressing her girlfriend,&quot; 
Pandora teased as she slipped the dress onto Mina.

      He chuckled, pleased to see Pandora is such a exuberant mood. &quot;Even though she 
doesn&#39;t have the sight, I&#39;m sure she&#39;s going to be one of my favorite dolls...&quot; Pandora 
cooed as she sat Mina up to tie the laces at the back of her dress. &quot;Though I do wish her 
hair was longer... but maybe Eveon likes short hair?&quot;

      &quot;You could always use your magic to change the length of her hair,&quot; Solomon said as 
Pandora lied the girl back down on the table.

      &quot;True... but if Eveon likes her hair shorter, then maybe I won&#39;t change it.&quot; The 
young fiend grabbed the mask and looked down at Mina, hesitating.

      &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Solomon asked.

      Pandora giggled nervously. &quot;No... I&#39;m just really excited... but... I hope Eveon 
won&#39;t get upset that I had to kiss her girlfriend.&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t contest once she&#39;s a doll as well,&quot; Solomon said with slight 
humor.

      &quot;When we get the power to turn all our dolls into fiends, I want to do Eveon and Mina 
first,&quot; Pandora whispered, before leaning down and pressing her lips to Mina&#39;s.

      Solomon watched as the young girl&#39;s twitching hands became still and lax against the 
table. 

***** 

      &quot;...we lost Mina?&quot; Tycara asked, shocked.

      Josh grimaced. &quot;Unfortunately so. If the fiends have her, she&#39;s as good as...&quot;

      &quot;She&#39;s probably a Death Doll,&quot; Bakra finished for him. &quot;And I&#39;m pretty sure there 
isn&#39;t a way to turn her back.&quot;

      &quot;Oh, but then...&quot; Tycara covered her mouth, looking over at Seth. &quot;Is there anything 
that can be done?&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t know... I could try to research it, but...&quot; He looked down at the ground. 
&quot;Once someone becomes a fiend, it&#39;s nearly impossible to turn them back and same probably 
goes for a Death Doll. Even if they received a large amount of holy power, it may only harm 
Mina instead of turning her back into a normal human.&quot;

      &quot;Eveon... Eveon&#39;s going to be heartbroken!&quot; Tycara exclaimed.

      &quot;And that&#39;s why we can&#39;t tell her,&quot; Josh said. &quot;Hoshi knows so she won&#39;t be caught 
off guard, but if Eveon finds out, it&#39;s dangerous.&quot;

      &quot;They&#39;re just using Mina to get to her, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Seth asked, already knowing the 
answer.

      It was then that Josh&#39;s phone vibrated in his pocket. He quickly checked the text 
message and nodded to Bakra. &quot;Faye just set off the emergency evacuation alarm so all the 
civilians will be out of the building.&quot;

      The demon drew his sword, trying to shake off the sadness he felt at Mina&#39;s 
unfortunate fate. &quot;Right, let&#39;s go.&quot; They entered through a back entrance that was earlier 
unlocked by Faye. Their plane of action was to have Bakra and Tycara clear the way, while 
Josh followed up and Seth covered the rear due to his vulnerability.

      People were still rushing out and it didn&#39;t take long for a security guard to notice 
Bakra&#39;s weapon. And it also didn&#39;t take long for the demon to defeat him. An automated 
voice sounded from the intercoms throughout the building, now shutting down all exits.

      &quot;I guess all the civilians escaped and Faye&#39;s closing it so the bad guys can&#39;t get 
out,&quot; Seth commented.

      &quot;We should hurry up before the units start mobilizing,&quot; Josh said, hurrying down the 
hall behind Tycara and Bakra.

      They easily took out every security guard they could find and it wasn&#39;t long before 
snakes came pouring out of the ceiling tiles. &quot;Cripes!&quot; Bakra exclaimed, jumping away when 
he saw one. &quot;I know Erin said she infiltrated the place, but this is ridiculous!&quot;

      Tycara motioned to an elevator in the lobby. &quot;We should start from the 30th floor 
since Faye said that&#39;s where the weird experiments happen.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Ah, shit...!&quot; Eric moaned. An emergency lock down? Were they under attack...? All 
the exits were locked so now he would have to manually override each door if he wanted to 
evacuate properly. Of course, something like this had to happen while Lilith and Adrian 
were out looking for the Gate where the Creator was sealed.

      The young man got out of his chair, stashing his laptop in his briefcase. Somehow, he 
had a feeling the timing was no coincidence... It was early in the morning and just 
yesterday Mina had been given to the fiends. Perhaps her friends found out and were seeking 
revenge?

      He exited his office, gritting his teeth. Eric wasn&#39;t happy to think of leaving his 
little Alice clones behind, but there were more important things to think about. He started 
heading from his personal lab to his actual office, checking his watch.

      &quot;Hey, Erin?&quot; He called down the empty hall. &quot;We need to get out of here!&quot; No 
response.

      He approached his office and locked inside, only to find his secretary missing. He 
hadn&#39;t seen her actual come straight to his office this morning, but he would have heard if 
she called in sick.

      Maybe he should look around? Eric perked up at the sounds of yells from down the 
hall. They were definitively male and he let out a groan. They were really under attack... 
The doctor perked up. What about Dark?

      Erin could be there and if she wasn&#39;t, she was either with Faye or had gotten out 
already. He went out into the hallway before freezing up. A couple of security officers 
were in front of him... or rather, lying on the ground about 30 feet away... with a couple 
of snakes either strangling them or biting.

      Eric was hoping he was in a really bad horror movie with a really bad title and he 
would wake up soon in a nice bed somewhere and Alice would knock on his door, asking if he 
wanted to have breakfast with her.

      Alas, that didn&#39;t happen, so he ran the other way, intending to circle around to get 
to Dark&#39;s room. &quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot;

      He whirled around just in time to see the dark green haired woman put her hand 
against the wall. A python sized snake immediately shot out at him, made from the wall 
material, and wrapped around him. Eric landed ungracefully on his butt, his arms 
constricted by the snake and his briefcase lying next to him. &quot;What the hell lady!&quot;

      Eric figured that if he was going to die, he was going to give the snake girl a piece 
of his mind. He looked up at her, ready to take out all his pent up frustration about 
Adrian out on her when he realized something. Despite the strange hair color and snake 
eyes... &quot;Erin?!&quot;

      She, however, wasn&#39;t in the mood to act like his pleasant secretary. &quot;Yes... though 
you may refer to me as the Goddess of Serpents.&quot;

      He gaped at her, not believing that his secretary was really a... a...! &quot;Oh shit... 
you aren&#39;t still mad about Mina, are you...?&quot;

      As if on cue, the snake around him tightened ever so slightly. &quot;Did you catch him?&quot; 
Eric craned his neck at the sound of a second voice. He barely recognized the hottie behind 
him as Faye and it took him some effort to tear his eyes away from her. Had she always been 
so attractive...? He focused his mind of cute, sweet, innocent Alice to keep himself from 
staring.

      Faye turned around at the sounds of security officers coming around the corner. &quot;Hold 
up your hands!&quot;

      The love goddess laughed and did just as they asked. However, they weren&#39;t expecting 
red ribbons to materialize on her fingers and shoot out at them. The soldiers retaliated 
with their guns, but Faye used one hand to create a crisscrossing barrier of ribbons, 
deflecting all the bullets.

      It wasn&#39;t long until the soldiers were tied up and squeezed until they passed out. 
Eric stared at Faye, not dumbfounded. &quot;So... you must be...&quot; he started, thinking to 
himself. &quot;You&#39;re the Goddess of Lesbian Bondage Action, aren&#39;t you?!&quot;

      Faye stared at Eric before directing her attention to Erin, who was stifling her 
giggles. &quot;Seriously. Why do people always assume this stuff about me?&quot; 

***** 

      Alice ran her hands up and down her arms, worried and cold. This was it... the last 
battle. She tensed up when she felt a pair of hands on her shoulders. &quot;It will be fine,&quot; 
Mariah said. &quot;Even if something happens, I will be there to help you.&quot;

      She could only give Mariah a small smile. &quot;I know... but... what if we don&#39;t win? 
What if we... die...?&quot;

      Mariah searched Alice&#39;s eyes a bit before giving her a hug. &quot;I promise you that 
nothing will happen. And when this is over, we&#39;ll go have a nice warm dinner... then we can 
travel around the country, just like we planned.&quot;

      A cold wind passed them by and Alice leaned into Mariah even more. &quot;I miss my 
sister,&quot; she choked out.

      &quot;I know,&quot; Mariah whispered, holding her. &quot;I know...&quot;

      The older girl looked down the desolate street, anxious as well. It was a decrepit 
part of New York City, long abandoned when strange monsters began to attack. In one of the 
buildings awaited their final target. &quot;What will we have?&quot; Alice&#39;s voice broke Mariah out 
of her musings.

      They started to walk down the dark street together. &quot;Well... maybe a salad,&quot; Mariah 
joked.

      &quot;That&#39;s stupid - we just finished our greatest battle ever and you want a salad?&quot;

      &quot;Maybe a nice steak instead? With mashed potatoes and a tall glass of lemonade,&quot; 
Mariah said with a smile.

      &quot;That sounds good,&quot; Alice said offhandedly. &quot;But maybe I would have French fries 
instead of mashed potatoes.&quot;

      &quot;Do you want to share a dessert?&quot; Mariah asked her, knowing the answer already.

      &quot;Yeah! We could get one of those large ice cream dessert things and finish it 
together!&quot; Alice said, beaming. As they continued down the street, the young girl grabbed 
Mariah&#39;s hand, still nervous.

      Mariah looked over at Alice before squeezing her hand slightly. &quot;What kind of ice 
cream would it be...?&quot;

      &quot;Vanilla,&quot; Alice replied, trying to keep up her happy demeanor. They were getting 
closer and closer to the foreclosed building.

      &quot;Right, then we&#39;ll get a nice room at a hotel and get some rest,&quot; Mariah whispered as 
they came to stop in front of the building. Alice was taking deep breaths. &quot;Do you want to 
wait a little bit?&quot;

      &quot;Y-yeah,&quot; the young girl said, rummaging around in her backpack. &quot;I want to... uh...&quot; 
She pulled out her diary and sat down on the steps. &quot;If anything happens, I want somebody 
to know about it.&quot;

      &quot;But nothing is going to happen,&quot; Maria said with a smile. &quot;So you can reread your 
diary and add an entry later about how yummy that ice cream was.&quot;

      &quot;Right...&quot; Alice whispered, starting to record the latest events. It would be her 
last entry, but she didn&#39;t know that yet.
