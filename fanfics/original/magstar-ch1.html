<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Goshima harbour 

The waves of the water crashed into the moss covered pillars of the 
peer. The sound of the waves blended well with the darkness of the 
night sky. It was somewhat calming for the purple haired girl, who had 
taken solitude by the calm of the sea. However, the calm faded as 
steps on the peer, managed to eliminate the sound in which the sea set 
for the girl. The man stepped closer to the purple haired girl

Who turned around abruptly to face the destroyer of the calm.  As the 
two faced of against each other, the man spoke up.

&#39;So you are Keiya Shindo...I have heard that you are the Waterstar 
soldier. Am I correct in saying so?&#39;

The girl remained silent.

&#39;&#39;So...you refuse to speak ...well...then you die...Aurrraaahhh!!!&#39;&#39;

The short, well-dressed businessman, started to grow. One by one his 
shirt buttons popped off as his muscles boosted and inflated. His 
fingernails grew in length and his eyes, which had been a light black,

Became a ghastly dark-purple. His hair began to rise and flicker as an 
evil aura surrounded his transforming body. A barrier busted around 
his body and all his clothes ripped off. A wave of dust 

Engulfed the floor of the peer as the girl stared blankly at the 
creature.  Its skin was now a pure dark black with three sharp spikes 
in each side of his shoulder. It was now twice it&#39;s original size and 
its shifty purple eyes were ready for battle...

&#39;&#39;What now...(slobber)...do you speak ...now?&#39;&#39;

The girl remained cool and calm.

&#39;&#39;...I am Keiya Shindo. It is my duty to destroy you...&#39;&#39;

&#39;&#39; Easier said then done...&#39;&#39;

&#145;&#145;...Waterstar power...Transform!!!!&#39;&#39;

A huge flash of light surrounded the girl called Keiya. In an instant, 
the mild mannered Keiya transformed into Waterstar, the magic star 
soldier of the sea. 

&quot;I was right blast it...you are Waterstar!!!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#146;s right, and Waterstar is going to be the last name that 
you&#146;ll ever hear.&quot;

The monster ran towards Waterstar and attempted to punch her. The 
soldier of the water simply sidestepped the attack. Infuriated, the 
monster made ready it&#39;s wrists. Streaks of red lightning gathered 
around its hands and two energy blasts fired out of them, headed 
directly at the Goddess of the sea. Waterstar then leaped over the 
attack and landed behind the monster. She then crouched down and 
kicked the monster, crushing its balance. The monster then stumbled to 
the ground, writhing in pain. Waterstar then started gathering blue 
energy within and around the palm of hand. She then raised her hand 
into the air and the energy around it transformed into a large ball of 
power, which surrounded her hand.

&quot;Crystal Frozen Fraction!!!&quot;

The energy ball surrounding Waterstar&#39;s palm blasted into the monster 
and hurled it into the water below the edge of the peer. For a while, 
the harbour was quiet, and was all-most silent if were not for the 
waves of the sea. Waterstar could hear nothing below but maintained 
her vigil. Suddenly, a huge fountain of water arose from the murky 
water below. The monster was hurled from the water and thrown onto the 
peer. It was clearly paralysed and it was quivering in shock and pain. 
Using its last breaths, it managed to utter a few words.

&#147;...Not bad ...girl...you...y-you...have won. But... as soon...as 
the...queen, gets...all four...t-talismans... This 
planet...and....everything on it...will be...destroyed...urh....&#148;

The creature faded into a pile of dust, which was blown away by the 
chilling east winds. Waterstar then walked over to the edge of the 
peer, and stared into the water. 

&#147;Four Talismans...? What is the dark world planning...?&#148;

The next day...

Keneda High School

The normal hustle and bustle of the high school was now shrouded by 
rumours and stories. Little do the people know that these stories have 
some truth to them. And a girl who is about to face her ultimate 
destiny will decide that there fate.

Yai Kitana and her friend Hisaka Saidouji walked through the crowds of 
people at the front gates of their school, gently pushing others out 
of the way. However the students there were too shocked about what had 
happened just yesterday.   

As soon as Hisaka and Yai pulled out of the crowds, Hisaka looked 
towards Yai. She had heard what the others were talking about. &quot;Yai, 
have you heard?&quot;	

&quot;Heard about what? What are you talking about Hisaka?&quot;

&quot;Mesumi was murdered yesterday...&quot;

&quot;Mesumi was killed... oh my god... how...Why...&quot;

&quot;The police say they have no suspect or motive, all they can say is 
that it was truly a horrific murder and that they were barely able to 
identify her...&quot;

&quot;My god...that&#39;s awful...how are her parents...they must be 
heartbroken...&quot;

&quot;I heard that her father all most had a stroke...&#39;&#39;

&quot;That&#146;s horrible. Not only that, but it&#39;s the tenth murder in the area 
in the past two weeks...&quot;

&quot;I know it&#39;s hard, but...come on Yai...lets go to class.&quot;

**********

In the classroom, the teacher, Mr Hinoba, had just written down the 
assignment on the blackboard, when a faint purple haired girl next to 
him had gently tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around and looked 
confused for a second, but then she gave him a suggestive look, that 
seemed to unlock his memory.

&quot;Oh I&#146;m sorry, Class let me introduce you to a new student joining the 
school. Her name is....&quot;

&quot;...Keiya Shindo. My name is Keiya Shindo. It is a great pleasure to 
meet you all.&quot;

While Keiya talked, Yai observed the girl, which she always did when 
she met someone new.  She was of average height for girl her age, 
around the same height as Yai herself. She had shoulder high, lilac 
hair, however light the colour was, it was an unusual hair colour, but 
it did make it any less interesting.

She also had these deep aqua blue eyes. They were so bright it seemed 
as though they shone up the entire room. They only contributed to the 
amazing smile she had. Then she looked around the room and her beauty 
mesmerized every boy in the class. Yai couldn&#39;t help but feel somewhat 
jealous, but she dismissed these feelings quickly enough. She then 
turn back to see Mr Hinoba, searching for somewhere for Keiya to sit. 

&quot;Very well Ms Shindo, that seat next to Yai is vacant.&quot;

Keiya bowed for respect and walked over the desk next to Yai. As she 
sat down, Yai introduced herself to the girl.

&quot;Hi, I&#146;m Yai Kitana, nice to meet you.&quot;

Keiya looked at Yai with mild curiosity. &quot;....&#146;Katana&#146;?&quot;

Yai sighed at that. She hated it when someone confused her name with a 
sword. &quot;No....&#39;Kitana&#39;.&quot;

&quot;Oh I&#146;m sorry, I-&quot;

&quot;No, no it&#39;s ok, people often confuse my name, and it&#146;s ok.&quot;

&quot;Yeah ok. Nice to meet you...Yai Kitana.&quot;

Later, Yai went to the roof of the north block of the school with her 
friends, Yumi and Hisaka, like they did every lunchtime. From the back 
of the roof, you got a beautiful view of the school grounds and the 
racing track, which was the pride of the school. While Yai leaned over 
the edge to see the entire school, something caught her eye on the 
racetrack. 

&quot;Hey...it&#39;s...&quot;

Hisaka saw that Yai&#146;s attention was elsewhere, and wanted to know what 
was going on. Hisaka always had that annoying little habit of 
requesting to know anything she wanted to know. &quot;What&#146;s up Yai? ...Oh! 
The new girl! Hey Yumi look, it&#39;s the new girl on the track!

&quot;What are you screaming about Hisaka...Oh...her....&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong Yumi?&quot; Yai asked. 

&#147;Oh nothing Yai, except every boy in school has been mesmerized by 
that girl. Did you know that she actually turned down 5 boys for dates 
today? I can&#146;t even get one to look at me.&#148;

&#147;Still Yumi, that&#39;s no reason not to like her.&#148; Yai said.  &#147;I think 
she&#39;s kinda&#39; cool...look.&quot;

Down below, Keiya was in a race with 6 other boys. Keiya had just 
overlapped 5 of them and had begun her third lap; steadily, closing in 
on Kazuhito.  Yai was astounded because normally nobody could even get 
near Kazuhito in a race.

&quot;Wow, your right Yai...she&#39;s closing in on Kazuhito. Still not 
impressed Yumi?&quot;

&quot;Hmph!&#39;&#39;

&quot;Hey, after the race, I say we say hello to her. What do you 
say...Hisaka? Yumi?&quot;

&quot;Sure&quot;

&quot;Whatever...&quot;

Back on the track, Keiya had just beaten all of the other guys 
including Kazuhito and won the race. Still as you would expect, she 
was a mess of huffing and puffing. Most of the other guys had 
congratulated Keiya&#39;s success, but Kazuhito were very annoyed and 
angry and refused to congratulate her. The other boys tried to make 
him listen to reason, but Keiya said it was fine and she didn&#146;t mind. 
Later on Yai, Hisaka, and Yumi went over to the track to say hello. 
They greeted and conversed with her. Yai and Hisaka were astounded by 
the stories Keiya told them, Yumi wasn&#39;t as impressed. However soon 
enough, even Yumi began to like her. At the end of the day, Yai and 
Keiya found out that they lived near each other, and decided to walk 
each other home. The two nattered and gabbed until they reached Yai&#39;s 
residential area. As Yai talked she stumbled over a stone and dropped 
her folder on the floor.

&quot;Oops...I dropped my folder...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll get it for you.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s ok...I...&quot;

The two girls crouched down to pick up the folder. Their hands 
clutched it at the same time. They then looked up and both Yai and 
Keiya were locked into each other&#39;s eyes. As Yai stared into Keiya&#39;s 
deep blue eyes, she felt her heart beating faster and faster. Suddenly 
everything around her became non-existent. All her eyes could focus on 
was her newest friend, the beauteous Keiya. Then all Yai could think 
about was how beautiful Keiya was, how her aqua blue eyes shine during 
the day, how her beautiful smile complimented her beautiful body...and 
it scared her to no end. But she had such an inviting pair of lips&#133;if 
only she could just... She shook sense in her head and prepared for 
the worst. 

&quot;I...I&#146;m sorry...I&#146;ve got to go...forgive me...&quot;

&quot;Yai...&quot;

Yai ran as fast as she could praying she could get away without Keiya 
attempting to catch her, which she did. As she got home she unlocked 
the door, went through it, re-locked it, and slid to the ground.

She was so absorbed by what she had just experienced and catching her 
breath that she didn&#39;t even check to see if her mom and dad were home.

&quot;My god. What was I thinking, d-doing? Did I...almost kiss a...&quot;

The ring of the phone silenced Yai&#146;s question. Quickly rushing over to 
the phone, Yai held the receiver to her ear and nervously began to 
speak.

&quot;Hello...Oh, hi Akira...&quot;

&quot;....&#146;Oh&#146;? What kind of greeting is that for your boyfriend?&quot;

A sigh escaped Yai&#146;s lips. &quot;I&#146;m sorry, I just had a bit of a shock. 
That&#146;s all.&quot;

&quot;Are you ok?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#146;m fine.&quot; 

&quot;Well all right, are you still up for our date on Saturday?&quot;

&quot;Yes of cause I&#39;ll see you then yeah...?&quot;

&quot;Yep sure. All right I&#39;ll speak to you soon then Yai?

&quot;Yes. Goodbye Akira.&quot;

Keneda High School

The next day at Keneda high school, things didn&#39;t seem to be running 
smoothly for Yai. Yai went to school with a mind swirling with 
questions. It was such a weird feeling. She had met this girl called 
Keiya Shindo just yesterday. She seemed so kind and charismatic, 
graceful and charming. Not only that, but she was stunningly 
beautiful. But Yai simply admired her. That was all it was. Or at 
least, she thought that was all it was. She didn&#146;t know how to explain 
it, but after looking into Keiya&#146;s eyes yesterday, she felt something. 
She just couldn&#146;t describe it, but at that moment, the moment she 
looked into Keiya&#146;s sparkling crystal blue eyes, she felt a twinge of 
passion. She just wanted to kiss her so much. To press those lush rosy 
lips against her own. But it didn&#146;t make any sense. Keiya was a girl. 
And Yai had a boyfriend who she really cared about. Why was this 
happening? Who is this girl and how is she able to affect her so? Yai 
had no real answer to her questions but she hoped Keiya did. She 
decided to talk to her. Yai thought that Keiya probably wanted to talk 
to her too, so that would be the best bet. Though things didn&#146;t go 
according to plan. 

As Yai reached the front gates of the school, she saw Keiya talking to 
some guys. They were laughing together, and Keiya didn&#146;t seem to be 
all that upset. However as she turned and saw Yai at the gate, she 
said her goodbyes and left for her class. Yai tried to catch up to 
Keiya but she was gone before she could. Throughout the day, Keiya 
went out of her way to avoid Yai. And Yai knew it herself. If at some 
point Keiya saw Yai, she&#146;d find some feeble excuse to leave. Later on 
in the day, Yai caught Keiya in a corridor towards Mr Hinoba&#146;s class. 
As usual she tried to leave, but this time, Yai had her cornered. Yai 
stepped towards Keiya carefully and spoke as calmly as she could. She 
didn&#146;t want to scare her off.

&#147;Hi Keiya.&#148;

&#147;&#133;Yai&#133;what do you want?&#148;

&#147;We really need to talk.&#148;

&#147;Sorry, I don&#146;t have the time. I have to meet up with the track team I 
joined today.&#148;

Keiya began to walk away coldly as she mouthed a quick goodbye to Yai. 
But Yai wasn&#146;t satisfied with that. She wanted answers to her 
questions. Yai promptly grabbed Keiya&#146;s wrist to prevent her from 
leaving, and Keiya turned around quickly in blind shock.

&#147;What do you think you&#146;re doing?&#148;

&#147;I said we have talk. I just need to talk to you, that&#146;s all. Please 
Keiya?&#148;

Keiya&#146;s resolved wavered as she heard Yai speak to her like that. She 
didn&#146;t want to do this but&#133;

&#147;I told you I have to meet the track team&#133;would you let go?&#148;

Keiya viciously jerked her arm from Yai&#146;s grasp, and stalked off. Yai 
looked shocked. She just wanted to talk to her. What was the problem? 

Though Yai did want to forget about it, she felt sort of disappointed 
and kind of hurt by the way Keiya was running from her. At the end of 
the day, Yai decided to confront Keiya and talk out their problems, 
but this time, she wouldn&#146;t allow Keiya to leave unless she got some 
answers to her questions.  Since Keiya had been chosen for the track 
team, Yai decided to wait for Keiya by the track. Keiya&#39;s track 
session didn&#39;t finish until 8.00, so Yai went to the library to wait 
for a few hours. At around 7.45, night had just fallen and the session 
ended early. However Yai didn&#39;t know this, but Keiya decided to 
practice for the next half hour. However, Keiya wasn&#39;t the only one to 
stay behind. She was quietly resting on a bench after running two laps 
around the track. As she rested, she suddenly heard steps on the grass 
coming towards her. She raised her head to see what it was, and calmed 
down a little when she saw who it was.

&quot;Kazuhito. How are you? &quot;

Kazuhito remained silent and stared intensely at Keiya.

&quot;Are...you ok...?&quot;

&quot;...You are quick on your feet. You beat me...&quot;

Keiya assumed that Kazuhito was still a little jealous of her speed 
(trust a guy to be insecure about something like that), but then 
realized that there was something clearly wrong with him. Kazuhito was 
clenching his fists and he seemed to somewhat unstable. Keiya knew 
what this meant...

&quot;Once I kill you then I will have enough energy to serve to my 
master...and it is only fitting that my newest rival is destroyed in 
the process.&quot;

&quot;You! You&#146;re the one behind the murders recently...your one of them!&quot;

Kazuhito smiled menacingly and began to transform into a monster. 
Before the lilac haired girl knew it, Katsuhiro&#146;s clothes and human 
flesh ripped of his body to reveal a frightening creature beneath. 
Keiya arose and maintained her calm, deciding to change into 
Waterstar.

&quot;Waterstar power...Transform!!!&quot;

As Yai walked into the track, she saw a huge flash of blue light shine 
into the night sky. When she looked into the track, she saw Keiya 
standing in front of a huge beast, dressed completely differently to 
the school uniform she was wearing before. 

The creature attacked Waterstar and smashed the bench as she dodged 
it. It continued to make swipes at the water goddess, which continued 
to be dodged. Waterstar tried to look for an opening to attack but the 
monster&#39;s fury was relentless. Suddenly the creature managed to punch 
Waterstar in the chest, and she was thrown across the track by the 
sheer force of the blow. Then Yai ran to protect her friend who she 
believed was in dire trouble. She ran to the girl and stood in front 
of her to protect from the monster.

&quot;Leave Keiya alone you beast!!&quot;

When Waterstar looked up, she was surprised to see Yai protecting her. 
But she was even more surprised to find that somehow she could 
recognise her, even under the guise of Waterstar. 

&quot;Yai, quick...leave! Get out of its way!!!&quot;

As Yai turned to face Waterstar, the titanic monster punched her away 
into a nearby tree, and closed in on Waterstar. 

&quot;You monster!!!&quot; Waterstar roared up and roundhouse kicked the 
creature. Once it fell to the ground, Waterstar tried to run to Yai, 
but the monster grabbed her ankle, and hurled her into a bench 
crushing
It totally. When Yai managed to open her eyes, she saw the creature 
about close in on Keiya.
 
&quot;No....Keiya...please...stop...leave...her...alone....&quot;

&quot;Powerless.&quot; Yai thought to herself. &quot;Why am I so powerless.... I...I 
want to protect Keiya ...why cant...I&quot;

&quot;Why don&#146;t I have the strength to do so!!!!?&#148;

Suddenly a bright light flashed in Yai&#39;s eyes. Electricity surrounded 
her body, and sent shockwaves through every part of her being. She 
could feel the muscles in her body tensing, tightening and building, 
raw power coursing through her veins. And then, as though it where an 
involuntary reaction, she screamed...

&quot;Lovestar power...Transform!!!&quot;

The monster turned around to see a massive flash of white light 
surrounding the girl; Whereas Waterstar was completely amazed and 
dumbfounded at the sight before her.

&quot;Yai is...a magic star soldier!?&quot;

The newly transformed Lovestar stood silently, glistening with a 
powerful golden energy.  

&quot;I am Lovestar...it is my duty to destroy all who fight with the 
Darkforce...&quot;

&quot;Why you...I&#146;ll kill you girl.... Raaaaaaahhhh!!!&quot;

The newly transformed Lovestar stood still and remained calm. 
Waterstar tried to get up but couldn&#39;t.

The blow the monster had given her had paralysed her. The monster 
itself tried to impale the goddess of love with its horn, but Lovestar 
simply jumped over the attack, and wrapped her legs around its head. 
She then placed her hands on the ground and then rolled forward, 
bringing the monster over her body and crashed it into the floor. She 
then leaped into the air and smashed her fist into the monster&#39;s 
stomach as she landed. Waterstar was astounded by Lovestar&#39;s power, 
and couldn&#39;t believe that the mild-mannered Yai Kitana was actually 
Lovestar, the goddess of love. Lovestar then leapt into the air and 
started to charge energy.  Golden white energy surrounded as she 
clasped her hands in front of her. 

Massive bolts of power caressed her hands as rocks began to rise from 
the ground. 

&quot;Crushing love blast!!!!!!!&quot;

A gigantic wave of energy crashed through Lovestar&#39;s hands and pounded 
the monster even deeper into

The earth. The monster then screamed in agony as a huge explosion tore 
it apart. The force of the blast blew Waterstar away. When it 
subsided, Lovestar landed on the ground and stared blankly into smoke 
of the crater. Waterstar then moved over to Lovestar, who was staring 
into the smoke of the crater.

&quot;...Yai...Lovestar...?&quot; 

&#147;... Keiya...what...am. I...?&quot;

As soon as she spoke, Lovestar passed out and de-transformed into Yai. 
Waterstar grabbed her before she could collapse to the ground. She 
then decided to take home, back to her own house.

&quot;Yai. Yai wake up...&quot;

&quot;Huh...Keiya...where&#133;am I...&quot;

&#147;You&#146;re at my house. I got Hisaka to phone your mom and dad and tell 
them that you would spend the night with me. You&#39;ve been asleep for 
quite some time now...I was getting worried.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a dream...Was it?&quot;

&#147;.... No&#133;you see you are Lovestar. You are a Magic Star Soldier, Super 
strong warriors with a sole purpose. To destroy the Darkforce.&quot;

&quot;The...Darkforce?&quot;

&quot;Yes, They are a group of beasts which plan to take over the earth. 
They inhabit an asteroid, which orbits the earth called the Deadstar. 
They plan to bring the Deadstar to earth by stealing enough energy 
from humans. If they succeed, they will take over the Earth and 
enslave humanity...I know what I am asking of you is probably out of 
line, but I need you to help me. You have some amazing skills and I 
can&#146;t win alone. Won&#146;t you help me?&quot;

&quot;... I know I&#146;m scared&#133;But. It&#146;s my duty. I will protect this planet 
alongside you&#133;I will protect it. As Lovestar...&quot;
