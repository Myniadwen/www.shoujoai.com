<h1>Angel's Gift (part 9 of 36)</h1>

<a href="../original/angelgift-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        Allison ventured out into the shop to check out the situation 
for herself. Marilyn and Roma stood by the shelves working together to 
put away part of the latest shipment of new books. She felt thankful 
that Marilyn had changed out of her Galactic Patrol uniform into more 
casual clothes, but that still left Roma in all of her metallic glory.

        The silvery robot seemed to sense Allison&#39;s gaze on her. Roma 
turned to look at her, asking mildly, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

        &quot;Hasn&#39;t anyone said anything about your being a robot?&quot; 
Allison managed weakly.

        From behind her she heard Kat&#39;s amused voice say, &quot;Well, we&#39;ve 
had a few people ask what movie she&#39;s the promotion for, but other 
than that, no.&quot;

        &quot;Humanoid robots are unusual here?&quot; Jenna asked Kat curiously.

        &quot;Somewhat,&quot; was Kat&#39;s deadpan answer.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t realize my appearance would be a problem,&quot; Roma 
noted, &quot;but it&#39;s quite easily remedied.&quot; She closed her golden eyes, 
&quot;Holographic disguise mode, engage.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, neat,&quot; Marilyn clapped her hands happily.

        &quot;Did we have to hire her too?&quot; Allison asked Kat softly.

        &quot;They sort of come as a set,&quot; Kat said with a smirk.

        Allison wondered what was so funny about that, then winced 
when she finally got the joke. &quot;Pervert,&quot; she murmured to Kat, who 
just chuckled wickedly.

        Shining bits of light danced all around Roma&#39;s form, seemingly 
solidifying suddenly into the illusion of flesh and blood. Short 
red-gold hair fell into golden eyes, cheeks rosy and her body looking 
like it was bursting with health. A body, because Allison&#39;s luck just 
seemed to be running that way of late, that was also entirely naked.

        &quot;Oh, goddess,&quot; Allison blurted out, turning away from Roma 
quickly.

        &quot;Are you converting?&quot; Kat asked while keeping an admiring eye 
on Roma.

        &quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; Allison groaned.

        &quot;What&#39;s wrong now?&quot; Roma asked, sounding just a bit cross.

        &quot;I believe it&#39;s the custom of this world to cover up nudity,&quot; 
Jenna offered cheerfully, &quot;probably due to their inability to control 
their environment.&quot;

        &quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry, but I can not produce clothing 
holographically,&quot; Roma said apologetically.

        &quot;Not that I mind the view,&quot; Kat smiled at her, &quot;but you&#39;ll 
shock the customers like that. I&#39;ll go see if I can find you something 
to wear.&quot; The tall young woman rummaged around the bathroom that she 
and Allison changed clothes in for a few moments, and came out again 
bearing an oversized T- shirt, &quot;Sorry, this&#39;ll have to do.&quot;

        Roma slid it on, and it came down just to the top of her milky 
thighs. &quot;Is this sufficient coverage?&quot; she asked, looking up at Kat.

        &quot;Just barely,&quot; Kat smiled back at her. Noticing that Allison 
still had her back turned she said a little louder, &quot;She&#39;s decent.&quot;

        &quot;Good,&quot; Allison sighed before looking back at Kat and the 
others.

        &quot;You know m&#39;love,&quot; Jenna said softly as she stepped up beside 
Allison, &quot;I think I was wearing more than that last night.&quot; She looked 
thoughtful, &quot;Though it was mostly transparent.&quot;

        Kat raised her eyebrows at her boss upon hearing that, while 
Allison blushed furiously.

        &quot;Shall I finish putting these books away?&quot; Roma asked as she 
was about to step up on a ladder, her T-shirt already beginning to 
ride up.

        &quot;Why don&#39;t we go get you something a bit more substantial to 
wear, first?&quot; a smiling Kat quickly suggested.

        &quot;Jenna and I&#39;ll stay to watch the shop while you get her some 
pants or something,&quot; Allison quickly volunteered.

        &quot;Panties, too,&quot; Marilyn said cheerfully.

        They could hear Roma asking the others curiously, &quot;What are 
panties?&quot; as the three women headed outside together.

        Allison walked over to her desk and sat down on the corner, 
laughing. &quot;Having them work here is going to make things interesting, 
at least,&quot; she chuckled.

        &quot;Indeed,&quot; Jenna agreed as she walked over to pick up a 
hardcover book. &quot;These are a primitive form of information storage, 
correct?&quot; she asked.

        Allison blinked a few times, the nodded. &quot;You could call them 
that, yeah,&quot; she smiled. &quot;We call them books, and in our culture there 
is a certain... romanticism about them. They&#39;re already out-dated, but 
we hold a fondness for them,&quot; Allison finished.

        &quot;I understand,&quot; Jenna held the book carefully, &quot;on my home 
world we have similar things, tomes of knowledge and fables dating 
back many years.&quot;

        &quot;These probably aren&#39;t that old,&quot; Allison noted they were 
holding the latest David Weber novel, &quot;but you&#39;re basically right.&quot; 
She felt a odd sense of relief at how reverently Jenna treated the 
books. She had broken up with boyfriends before over their attitudes 
to her books, she wouldn&#39;t have wanted to loose Jenna that way.

        &quot;So many books,&quot; Jenna slid the one in her hands back into 
it&#39;s place. She looked over at Allison curiously, &quot;Have you read them 
all?&quot;

        &quot;Most of them,&quot; Allison admitted with a slight smile, &quot;but not 
all.&quot; She looked around her, and realized that she hadn&#39;t been reading 
as much lately. Ever since Jenna had arrived, her life had been much 
more exciting than her books were. She reached out and stroked the 
binding of one of the older science fiction novels, remembering 
reading it as a little girl.

        Jenna sat her hand over Allison&#39;s pressing down gently. 
&quot;There&#39;s always new books aren&#39;t there,&quot; she murmured, &quot;always more to 
read?&quot; A gentle smile, &quot;I think I may envy you that.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve hidden behind my books a lot,&quot; Allison admitted. She 
smiled back at Jenna, &quot;I don&#39;t seem to be able to do that around you.&quot;

        Jenna laughed softly, &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot;

        They talked about books for a little while longer before the 
front bell rang. &quot;Yes?&quot; Allison walked towards the shop&#39;s front door, 
Jenna close behind.

        &quot;Mission accomplished,&quot; Kat smiled.

        Roma walked in behind her, followed by Marilyn. The robot was 
dressed in a stylish blouse and long skirt, comfortable shoes on her 
feet. &quot;What do you think?&quot; Roma asked.

        &quot;You look fine,&quot; Jenna smiled.

        &quot;And she&#39;s even wearing panties,&quot; Marilyn informed them all 
unnecessarily.

        &quot;Yes, they&#39;re quite comfortable,&quot; Roma lifted her skirts.

        &#39;Pink,&#39; Allison noted before quickly looking away.

        &quot;You&#39;re not supposed to show them to people,&quot; Kat quickly got 
her skirt down again.

        &quot;The why am I wearing them?&quot; Roma asked curiously.

        Kat sighed softly.
