<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Natalie and Jenn ventured up and down the aisle of a nearby market place 
and Jenn stopped to glance over the snack food section. 

&quot;So you got everything?&quot; Natalie inquired as she glanced down at the 
small wire basket she held. Notebooks, pens, paper, tampons, painkillers 
and other odds and ends filled the basket. 

Jenn quickly snatched up two bags of Doritos and held them out to 
Natalie, &quot;Nerve food.&quot; She stated with a shy grin. 

Natalie chuckled, &quot;You too, hummm?&quot; She remarked with a small smile, 
&quot;Alyson loves Doritos during her time too.&quot; She explained. 

&quot;They&#39;re great.&quot; Jenn admitted guiltily, glancing down at the chips, &quot;I 
always allow myself these pleasures once a month.&quot; she justified.

&quot;Or you&#39;ll kill someone?&quot; Natalie added with a knowing grin. 

&quot;No...&quot; Jenn frantically shook her head in such a way that it caused 
Natalie to laugh out loud. Jenn flushed lightly and smiled, she had not 
felt this good in such a long time and she was beginning to feel alive 
again, even with the painful cramps.

&quot;Come on.&quot; Natalie nodded towards the cashier, &quot;Let&#39;s pay for this stuff 
and get going.&quot; She stated as she moved down the aisle. 

&quot;Alright.&quot; Jenn agreed and began to follow close behind Natalie when her 
mind drifted to Cherilyn, &quot;Say...&quot; Jenn spoke up, &quot;Do you have any idea 
what we are going to say to Cherilyn when we get there?&quot; She asked 
softly. 

Natalie shook her head solemnly, &quot;Not a clue.&quot; She confessed as she set 
the basket on the counter, &quot;I figure the words will come to us when we 
get there.&quot; She shrugged as she watched the cashier punch prices into 
the cash register. 

Jenn&#39;s head lowered and she studied the bandages on her wrists, &quot;I can 
see why she wouldn&#39;t want to be around us.&quot; She stated glumly, &quot;Why 
would anyone want to hang around a bunch of suicidal, depressed, 
sexually deprived, crazy girls like us.&quot;

Natalie placed a hand upon Jenn&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Look at me!&quot; She forced the 
girl to face her, &quot;We are not crazy. No matter how much you feel like 
it, don&#39;t believe it. We may have our issues but that is what makes us 
who we are.&quot;

Jenn lightly closed her eyes and bowed her head, &quot;I can&#39;t help it. I 
mean, I can&#39;t even remember why I cut myself or my feelings for anyone.&quot; 

Natalie let out a frustrated sigh, &quot;That is why we are here. Remember 
you are not alone.&quot; She gave the girl a tight hug. 

&quot;Ummm... excuse me?&quot; The cashier tentatively interrupted the girls, &quot;I 
don&#39;t mean to interrupt this tender moment, but we do have other waiting 
their turn.&quot; She remarked, nodding behind the girls.

Natalie and Jenn both flushed as they noticed several people had stepped 
into line behind them and were now watching them with awed expressions 
upon their faces. &quot;S... sorry...&quot; Jenn stammered as she pulled some 
money out of her pocket of her jean skirt and handed the cashier a 
hundred dollar bill. 

The cashier started at the hundred for a moment, &quot;You two are from that 
academy, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She asked curiously as she punched more numbers 
into the machine in front of her and started to get Jenn her change. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Natalie replied, grabbing the bags of their things from the 
counter and noticing that the cashier&#39;s hands were becoming visibly 
shaken by their presence. 

&quot;Do... do you really live up there...? On the hill?&quot; The cashier asked 
nervously as she handed Jenn her change, &quot;I mean it&#39;s haunted, isn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

Natalie glanced around to see that more of the costumer had taken an 
interest in them, &quot;No, it isn&#39;t.&quot; Natalie stated, protectively placing 
an arm around Jenn, whom didn&#39;t seem to notice their undue attention as 
she pocketed her change and Natalie began to lead the girl towards the 
exit. 

&quot;Is it true you are all lesbians?&quot; The cashier asked bluntly, glancing 
between Jenn and Natalie. 

&quot;That is none of your business.&quot; Natalie snarled and hurried Jenn out of 
the store. 

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; Jenn inquired blinking at the store to see 
several people peering out the windows at them. 

&quot;Just ignore them.&quot; Natalie stated with slight agitation, &quot;They are just 
overly curious and an irritant.&quot; She explained taking Jenn by the hand 
and hurrying her down the road and around a corner that lead up a long 
path to the academy. Occasionally she would glance over her shoulder to 
make sure they were not being followed.

&quot;Does that always happen?&quot; Jenn asked interested to learn more about the 
world outside of the Academy walls. 

&quot;No...&quot; Natalie was becoming more anxious to reach the top of the hill 
and return to the safe of the dorms, &quot;Sometimes they get violent.&quot; Her 
eyes darted around making sure they were not being followed, &quot;The 
outsiders don&#39;t seem to know how to handle us. They leave us alone most 
of the time. Then other times...&quot; Natalie spotted something that made 
her instantly halt in her tracks.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Jenn inquired searching around for what could have 
caused Natalie&#39;s abrupt stop. Then she spotted him, a tall man in a long 
white cloak with scruffy wavy hair, the same man from her dreams, &quot;That 
man...&quot; She shakily pointed at the man. 

Natalie pulled Jenn behind some trees that flanked the path, &quot;Hide.&quot; She 
commanded not letting her eyes off of Drake, &quot;What&#39;s he doing here?&quot; She 
muttered to herself. 

&quot;Na... Natalie...&quot; Jenn stammered as she quickly followed behind 
Natalie, &quot;That man... he came to my house...&quot; She explained uneasily.

Natalie spun around to face Jenn, &quot;Your house?!?&quot; She questioned in 
bewilderment.

&quot;My house from before... In the dream...&quot; Jenn shook her head in 
confusion, &quot;When I met Kim. He was fighting with Kris. Kim... she 
mentioned him too. He has been looking for her for some reason.&quot; She 
apprehensively explained.

Natalie peeked around the tree to see Drake heading for the main gates 
of the Academy, &quot;That&#39;s Drake Dalfort, Alyson&#39;s twisted brother.&quot; She 
explained coldly, not letting her eyes off of the man.

&quot;Her brother?!?&quot; Jenn exclaimed mortified by the idea, &quot;How can such a 
sweet girl be related to that nightmare?&quot; She probed. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Natalie replied anxiously, &quot;But if he is here then it&#39;s 
bad news. He probably wants to take Alyson back to his him. This is very 
bad.&quot; Her mind reeled as she tried to think of a way to stop the man.

&quot;We can&#39;t let him!!!&quot; Jenn softly cried out in worry, &quot;He will hurt her 
for running away won&#39;t he?&quot; 

&quot;Or worse.&quot; Natalie admitted, still searching for some means of stopping 
the man when she noticed Head Mistress Sophia and Melissa step through 
the main gates of the Academy, &quot;Looks like he isn&#39;t going to get to her 
after all.&quot; She stated with a sly smirk, &quot;Come on.&quot; She coaxed her 
friend out from behind the tree to get in earshot.

Sophia observed both girls carefully as they cautiously tread along the 
edge of the road. She watched them as they moved from one tree to the 
next, making certain to not attract Drake&#39;s attention. The Headmistress 
hoped in her heart that the girls would not increase the difficulty of 
the situation when Drake approached her; towering over the two women as 
he glared down at them. 

&quot;I&#39;m here for my sister.&quot; Drake stated coolly, &quot;And the red eyed girl. I 
know they are here.&quot; 

&quot;She is no longer your responsibility, Mr. Dalfort.&quot; Sophia calmly 
informed, &quot;And you can not have Kimberly even if you were her parent.&quot; 

&quot;You have not right to them.&quot; Drake glowed, &quot;Alyson clearly belongs with 
me and you are not aware of the circumstances surrounding that other 
girl.&quot;  

&quot;We are well aware of their situations.&quot; Sophia remarked, &quot;Alyson is 
welcome here just like all the other girls at Whispering Hills.&quot; She 
explained, not being phased by the man&#39;s intense stares.

Drake&#39;s hand shot out from under his cloak and grabbed Sophia by the 
front of her dress shirt, &quot;She is mine. You will give me the child or 
I&#39;l-.&quot; He began to commanded when Melissa jumped forward.

&quot;Why you big bully.&quot; Melissa glowered, &quot;You have no right bulling my 
sister around like that.&quot; 

Sophia held her hand out to stop her twin, never allowing her eyes to 
leave Drakes, &quot;Always like you, Drake.&quot; She noted, unruffled by Drake&#39;s 
threatening motions, &quot;You seem to think that your overbearing scare 
tactics will work on everyone, but you have forgotten who we are and we 
will not allow you to take any of our girls.&quot; She stated boldly.

Drake beamed in rage and suddenly swung at the head mistress. Sophia 
made no attempt to dodge as the man&#39;s fist crashed hard into the side of 
her face, knocking her to the ground. He stomped over the woman with his 
fist clenched, &quot;You will promptly return Alyson to me now!&quot; He ordered, 
now fuming with rage. 

&quot;Why you selfish ass!!!&quot; Natalie cried out as she dropped the shopping 
bags and charged at Drake. 

&quot;Natalie stop!!&quot; Melissa called out to the girl, however it was too 
late. Natalie&#39;s retractable blade sprung forth from its hiding place 
beneath her sleeve and she flung herself at Drake like a wild animal.

&quot;I thought I smelt you.&quot; Drake stated with a malicious grin as he turned 
to face the girl. 

&quot;I&#39;ve had enough of you hurting Alyson.&quot; Natalie tossed a set of 
throwing daggers at the man who swiftly stepped out of the way. 

&quot;Child, you forget. Anything Alyson taught you she learned from me 
first.&quot; Drake remarked coldly keeping his eyes closely on the girl as 
she leapt through the air and lunged her bladed arm at him. Double-quick 
he stepped out of her way allowing the girl to slam her knife into the 
dirt road, &quot;As such I know all your moves.&quot; He explained with a chuckle 
of amusement.

Natalie crouched low as to keep out of the man&#39;s reach, &quot;Is that so?&quot; 
She remarked with a grin as she produced three more daggers from behind 
her back and plunged them into his thigh with all her might. 

Drake howled out in pain, &quot;You little bitch!&quot; He grabbed Natalie by the 
blade arm and lifted her off the ground, &quot;So you have a few tricks up 
those sleeves of yours. Your daggers nothing more then a minor pain to 
me.&quot; He explained glaring at the girl. 

Natalie flung her legs up over Drake&#39;s arm and wrapped them around it. 
Drake seemed startled by this manoeuvre as he watched the girl grab his 
arm with her free hand then yanked downwards with all her strength 
causing his arm to snap with an ugly cracking sound. Drake immediately 
dropped the girl to the ground, his arm now uselessly dangling at his 
side. Natalie crouched and prepared for another round of assaults when 
Melissa grabbed Natalie around her waist and pulled her to the ground, 
holding onto her tight.

&quot;Let me at him!!&quot; Natalie cried out, kicking and flailing her arms 
fiercely, &quot;I will kill him! Let me KILL HIIIIMM!!!&quot; She screamed out 
irately as she tried to free herself from the Head Mistresses grip.

Drake stared down at his now twisted arm as it hung limply, &quot;Very 
interesting.&quot; He remarked, and then turned to the flailing child. 

&quot;Nat, calm down!!&quot; Melissa soothed, &quot;You have no idea what you are 
doing!!&quot; She pulled the girl away from Drake as the man watched with 
amusement. 

&quot;Natalie!!!&quot; Jenn jumped out from her hiding space with her shopping 
bags in hand and ran across the street towards her friend.

Drake swiftly turn his attention on Jenn, &quot;You!&quot; He glared intensely at 
the girl, &quot;So this is where you have been hiding. Where is your little 
redheaded girlfriend?&quot; He inquired with a snarl. 

Jenn stopped where she was and stared at the man, &quot;Kim?&quot; She replied 
curiously. Her eyes were suddenly caught in Drake&#39;s demonic gaze. She 
suddenly experienced a feeling of being exposed and violated as if his 
eyes crawled over her body, however she could not free herself from his 
gaze. It felt as if the man&#39;s eyes were boring through her very soul. 
Then she started hearing a ringing in her ears, something that sounded 
sort of like wind chimes, but not quite. She dropped her things to the 
ground and clenched the sides of her head as the chine&#39;s increased in 
pitch, filling her mind. Abruptly she let out a pained scream, then 
instantly collapsed to the ground in a fit of tears, mumbling in 
coherently to herself. 

Sophia rushed over to Jenn&#39;s side; putting herself between Drake and the 
girl, &quot;Leave her alone.&quot; She demanded giving them man a stern scowl. She 
wrapped her arms around the shaking, crying child. 

&quot;Leave this place.&quot; Melissa commanded, her eyes filled with rage as she 
held a squirming Natalie, &quot;You have done enough harm here now leave.&quot; 

Drake glanced from one head mistress to the other, then down at his arm. 
&quot;I guess you can keep her for the time being.&quot; He smiled sinisterly down 
at Natalie, who stopped thrashing that moment and saw the pleasure in 
his eyes, &quot;Alyson will return to be soon enough. So will the others. You 
will see.&quot; He turned and strolled away without even a limp in his 
stride.

Sophia scooped Jenn up into her arms and grabbed her bags, &quot;We have to 
hurry.&quot; She exclaimed with increasing urgency. 

Melissa pulled Natalie to her feet and started after her sister. 

 &quot;We can&#39;t just let him get away.&quot; Natalie protested, not being able to 
let her eyes off of the man. 

&quot;There are more important things to worry about.&quot; Melissa stated, &quot;We 
must hurry. Alyson needs you.&quot; 

Natalie faced Melissa to see an extreme amount of distress in the 
woman&#39;s eyes. She did not understand what was going on, but knew that if 
Melissa was worried about something then it must be serious and allowed 
herself to be lead back to the Western dorms.
