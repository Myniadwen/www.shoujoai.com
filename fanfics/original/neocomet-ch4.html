~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Mazda Family Training Camp, Fuzhou, Neo-China 

Ming Lo ran her hands up and down her arms in response to the coldness. 
This lack of heat was not unique to Fuzhou itself, there were many 
places and town dotted along the west of Neo-China which suffered from 
snow and chill. Such a thing would have been unheard of years past. 
Before the landing of the Genesis Comet. Now the climate of the earth 
was changing. What were once warm countries grew cold as winter. Those 
that were once wintry countries had now became hotter. Such was the 
power of the Genesis Comet&#39;s wrath. 

And for a while, Ming Lo had forgotten just how cold it could get in 
these parts. But she stopped rubbing her arms when she focused on the 
task at hand. Her golden-brown eyes rolled from her attire (snow 
mountain clothing, mostly) to the gigantic complex ahead of her. 

The Mazda Training Camp. 

There was awe in Ming Lo&#39;s eyes as she looked upon the Training Camp for 
the first time in almost ten years. In all that time, it had not changed 
a bit. The whole location was hidden from straight view by a towering 
stone wall, which was now painted in points with settled snow. Along the 
wall were rows and rows of dagger-like blades, designed specifically to 
keep people from getting in. Or out. Though the shape of the outer walls 
were akin to design of a western prison, the walls was the only thing 
about it that took inspiration from that side of the world. Everything 
else around the Mazda Training Camp reflected its Chinese nature. From 
the writings that adorned the walls to the students whom had taken it 
upon themselves to train here. 

Ming Lo felt quite humbled to be here again. She was a member of the 
Mazda family herself, but due to its opinions on female assassins... her 
sway was limited here. But none the less, she was here again. After 
learning all she could abroad, Ming Lo was back to be re-absorbed into 
Mazda family. 

Snow fell from Ming Lo&#39;s coat began walking. A gust of visible cold air 
escaped her lips as she rushed forwards with a smile, towards her true 
home. The girl walked up to the gates of the Training Camp, and two 
spears lowered, blocking Ming Lo from entering the halls of it. Two 
burly guardsmen loomed over the younger girl, with questioning 
expressions on their chiselled faces. 

&quot;You there!&quot; One barked, &quot;Turn away now. Someone such as yourself has no 
business here.&quot;

Ming Lo sneered at them. &quot;Do you believe that it is wise to speak at me 
with such disrespect? Obviously you know nothing of the woman that 
stands before you. All that you possess are fragile misconceptions of my 
person.&quot;

The other guard was alarmed by the woman&#39;s method of speech. She was 
obviously an educated person. More than the majority of the people who 
lived inside of the Mazda Camp. But still...

He pointed in the opposite direction. &quot;I don&#39;t care who you are. Leave. 
Now.&quot;

&quot;Is that so...?&quot; Ming Lo pulled the hood of her coat down, revealing her 
concealed identity. &quot;You expect the granddaughter of Ahura Mazda to turn 
her back to the place of her birth?&quot;

Both guards gasped and looked on with wide eyes. Ming Lo. It was 
actually Ming Lo. The granddaughter of the current leader of the Mazda 
family, Ahura Mazda-- arguably the greatest assassin walking the face of 
the earth. Such disrespect could end in their heads on twin pikes. The 
two guards lowered their spears and their heads, bowing in apology.

&quot;I-I&#39;m sorry, Miss Ming Lo,&quot; The right guard said. &quot;But Lord Ahura has 
demanded that we keep security around the compound as tight as it can 
possibly be. Please forgive my mistake about your identity.&quot;

Ming Lo nodded. She was in a forgiving mood today. Mostly because she 
was finally returning to the place she hadn&#39;t seen in so long. &quot;You are 
forgiven. Just let me pass. I must meet with my grandfather.&quot;

To that, the guards offered no resistance. They separated, then the 
portcullis restricting access to the Training Camp rose up. Ming Lo 
watched it rise and then walked into the Camp. But while she was 
expecting to be bombarded with pride at this flourishing establishment, 
her heart actually sank. Ming Lo walked through the courtyard with a 
glassy disbelief in her eyes. The training camp was almost barren. In 
her youth, Ming Lo remembered dozens of men training with an assortment 
of different weapons. But those numbers had dwindled to measly five. 
Five active students. The shock in Ming Lo&#39;s disposition. Even as some 
of the students practiced their skills in front of their teacher, she 
could not hide that confusion she felt. 

Why had this school become so vacant? And why was she not told of this?

She could wait no longer to find out. Ming Lo&#39;s quick walk burst into 
the form of a run. She dashed through the stone courtyard of the 
training camp, then dashed towards one of the three major buildings that 
made up the camp. The building she was running towards was the main 
construction of site. A tall tower, large, splitting off in four 
pathways to the surrounding walls. Ming Lo ran up to the door and 
knocked upon it. She was allowed in by one of the guards that had been 
stationed there. The girl introduced herself to them and then ran up the 
spires of that tower. Ignoring all other rooms, halls and sections, she 
climbed up the tower in haste and made her way to the summit. Before 
long she was at the final level of the tower. Which was also the room of 
the Mazda family&#39;s leader, Ahura Mazda. 

She didn&#39;t bother to knock. She simply pushed both gold-lined doors 
open. They swung to either side of doorway, and presented the quarters 
of Ahura, in all their glory. This was by far the richest and most 
lavishly decorated room in the entire Mazda Training Camp. Where the 
other sections of the Camp were foreboding and cold, this room was 
beautiful and charming. Red and gold carpets with images of warring 
dragons sown into them, fine curtains made from the rarest Neo-Indian 
cotton, fire-lamps of Neo-English creation, silver statues of Buddha 
around the upper shelves and dozens of weapons strewn across the shaved 
stone walls. Those weapons were all spears, the signature battle tool of 
the Mazda family. The most significant of which; the spear that was hung 
horizontally over the far wall. A sacred treasure, that the Mazda family 
had bought from a Scottish ironmonger over a thousand years ago. A spear 
so powerful it was thought to be infused with the spirit of the Dark One 
himself. 

The weapon known and feared as Airget-Lam. 

Only the current leader of the Mazda family was ever allowed to wield 
it. It was code that if anyone other than the family leader were to 
touch it, they would be banished from the camp. Such a thing had never 
happen. At least not yet. Yet below Airget-Lam was a throne of polished 
gold and pine. And on that throne was the leader of the family, Ahura 
Mazda. 

Ming Lo went to her knees as she looked upon her grandfather for the 
first time in a decade. The aging assassin looked over at her with 
knowing eyes. For all his age and weakening, Ahura&#39;s mind had not slowed 
at all. He glared at his granddaughter with cold and still eyes. She 
could also see that fate overtaking the Mazda family. It completely 
overshadowed everything else there was to think about. Including Ming 
Lo&#39;s return. 

&quot;Greetings, my Child.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Hikoukuji Inn, District Nine, Nagoya, Neo-Japan

&quot;When do I get to see my Father, Miss Nakagawa?&quot;

The pensive Julia stood closely beside Ayame as she asked this. Though 
she had technically been living in Neo-Japan for over a year, she had no 
knowledge of the outside world or what its people were like. Those of 
pure Neo-Japanese birth. Right now she only had Ayame as support. And 
though they had only known each other for a brief few hours, Julia felt 
more reliant on her than she had done anyone else at this point. Three 
hours ago, the two women had made a successful escape from the Shougatsu 
Financial Group&#39;s Bio-Technological Research Department. As soon as the 
two were out in the open, Ayame hopped on her bike (Megumi) and Julia 
followed along sitting behind her. And the two drove straight back to 
inner city Nagoya. Unfortunately there were some problems in making 
contact with Simon. A prospect that wasn&#39;t appealing to either woman. 
Ayame just wanted the rest of her payment for doing what she had done. 
And after (seemingly) escaping unnoticed, Ayame felt that 8,500 was more 
than owed to her. Thusly she wanted to get this payment and end this 
entire mission by dropping Julia off with Simon. Julia&#39;s concerns were 
far more serious. She was literally alone in the world without Simon and 
her Grandfather, Harris. Until she met up with them again she would 
never feel safe. And she and Ayame weren&#39;t exactly getting along like 
the best of buddies, either.

The two stood in a queue that was lined up against a desk. This queue 
just happened to be inside an Inn. Julia clung to Ayame&#39;s stronger arm 
tightly as she scanned the place over. This was the kind of place that 
travellers and financially-secure drifters came through every few days. 
Just a quick place to stay before moving to new sights and locations. It 
was full of weary vagrants and city-jumpers. Some looked crooked, others 
looked trustworthy. But to Julia, all of them were potentially 
dangerous. Mostly because a large number of men in those crowds had not 
spared her their eyes. Those carnivorous glances of attraction that she 
had grown to be so aware of. The Post-Comet world was not a nice place 
to live in. Ayame sighed as she felt Julia tighten up again against her 
arm.

&quot;Will you just relax?&quot; Ayame seethed, fully annoyed by this Scottish 
girl, &quot;I told you before that there is nothing to worry about. While I&#39;m 
here you&#39;ll be safe. I&#39;m being paid to protect you and bring you back to 
your Father safely. So just... cool it down a little.&quot;

Julia&#39;s eyes hardened. &quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say. This sort of thing 
isn&#39;t new to you. I&#39;ve bet you&#39;ve come across dozens of people like 
these. Well I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m new to all this... and it frightens me... I 
just want to be with my Dad...&quot;

Again, Ayame simply sighed. Julia was a lot tougher than she looked. In 
spirit of course, not body. But it was an asset. Still, she did have 
this crippling fear of the unknown. Which was bound to be even stronger 
now since it was the first time in a year that she had been out of 
doors. 

&quot;Look,&quot; It was at this time that Ayame realized she could be a little 
bit more supportive. She more than most knew what it was like to lose 
contact with your parents under circumstances beyond your control, &quot;If I 
could, I&#39;d take you to your Dad right now. But the problem is, they set 
up checkpoints all over Nagoya last year to keep the flow of travel and 
immigration down. Because of that, checkpoints are only opened every 
four days. And we&#39;ve got another three days before the next checkpoint 
opens. So we have to crash at an Inn like this one until that happens. I 
know... it&#39;s kinda scary to be in this situation. Believe me... I know 
what it&#39;s like to feel as though you&#39;re alone in the world. But for 
now... just rely on me. I&#39;ll protect you and keep you safe from 
everything until you reach your Dad. Okay?&quot;

Julia&#39;s hard expression softened into a smile, and she loosened her grip 
around Ayame&#39;s arm. She didn&#39;t let go, just loosened the grip slightly. 
Which was enough for Ayame herself. Julia was far prettier when she was 
smiling. As the line they were in began to recede, Ayame marched up to 
the front desk and waited to be spoken to by the young woman behind it.

The receptionist greeted her. &quot;Welcome to Hikoukuji Inn. How can I help 
you?&quot;

&quot;I need two rooms,&quot; Ayame asked, directly, &quot;A single bed each. 
Preferably next to each other. Have you got anything like that free?&quot;

The receptionist took a look down at her bookings, then replied. &quot;...I&#39;m 
so sorry miss, but we have no individual rooms left. When the 
checkpoints close those are the first rooms to go. All we have left are 
three rooms, each containing an individual, double-sized bed. Would that 
be satisfactory?&quot;

&quot;Double bed? One room? ...Double bed?&quot; Ayame went wide-eyed. &quot;...Uh...&quot;

Julia stepped ahead a little, still holding onto Ayame&#39;s arm. &quot;I don&#39;t 
mind sleeping on the floor, Miss Nakagawa.&quot;

&quot;...I can&#39;t have that. Your Father would probably be angry if I didn&#39;t 
take proper care of you. And now that I think about it, would you please 
stop calling me Miss Nakagawa? My name is Ayame, alright? It&#39;s Ayame.&quot;

&quot;So are you two going to be taking one of the rooms?&quot; Asked the 
receptionist. 

From that, Ayame&#39;s shoulders sagged. It wasn&#39;t like she had much choice. 
Although she didn&#39;t mind sleeping outdoors, that would never do for 
Julia. She didn&#39;t much look like the type to do something like that. 
Ayame sighed and nodded to the receptionist. 

&quot;Fine,&quot; She said, &quot;We&#39;ll take the room. The name we&#39;re under is 
Nakagawa. We&#39;ll be renting the room for the next three days.&quot;

The receptionist nodded to that and began writing down the arrangements 
of their stay. She handed Ayame a key to their room, and she exchanged 
that key for three days worth of payment for the rooms. 560 credits in 
all. After stuffing the key into the back pocket of her jeans, Ayame 
walked out of the line with Julia behind her. They began walking towards 
the glass doors in the front of the Inn, past all those who were 
scrambling to get accommodation for the checkpoint issue. Julia stopped 
her before they left the Inn.

And she couldn&#39;t help but inquire, &quot;Where are we going now, Miss Naka- 
...Ayame?&quot;

Ayame cast a glare up and down the Scottish girl&#39;s attire. &quot;...To a 
shopping arcade. We need to get you some new clothes.&quot;

Blue River Road, Cairo, Neo-Egypt

Cairo. It had been one of the last cities to be accepted into the 
Safe-Zone Project. And so it was one of the last cities to experience 
re-generation after the landing of the Genesis Comet. You could tell 
that be the looks of this place. The streets of Blue River were foul 
with the stink of suffering. Men ambled idly from road to road, passing 
rich-looking people by and begging them for some spare change. Only the 
gracious and most generous of those people gave money to them. But on 
the whole, few did. There was no excuse for the beggars. Work was not in 
short supply, many jobs had to be taken care of for the renewal of the 
world. Especially in ruined towns like Cairo. They were simply work-shy. 
They believed that since they had so  little of their lives to enjoy, 
they might as well make them as easy and comfortable as possible. Of 
course, it never worked out that way. 

Along the dusty sand-stone streets, were alleyways. Alleyways that 
safely concealed any dirty dealings and backhand exchanges. They also 
acted as a blanket of secrecy for the women who chose to sell themselves 
for money. In this day and age, it was the easiest way for a girl to 
make money. It paid well, and demand was never short. But their 
prostitution was still looked on with the same stigma as it would have 
seen in the 20th Century. It had not escaped these women&#39;s notice that 
prostitution was illegal within the Safe-Zones, but as long as they did 
not get caught, they were willing to risk expelling from Neo-Cairo for 
it.

One of those women happened to be standing in an alleyway just off the 
pavement of Blue River Road. Dressed in tight and revealing clothes, the 
woman cast an annoyed glare towards the outer street. It was getting 
close to morning and she had not gotten much work tonight.

&quot;Maybe I should go outside for a second, to be seen,&quot; The girl whispered 
to herself.

But she was not the only one to hear that. The girl looked to her left, 
back into the darkness of the pitch black alleyway. The sound of 
footsteps could be heard. Slow walking, ever shifting forwards. There 
was an eerie &#39;feel&#39; to those footsteps. And just like that, the girl 
knew that whoever was walking towards her was not a person to do 
&#39;business&#39; with. Soon that person stepped from the shadows completely. 
The girl eyed him up and down. The man was not of the city life. He 
looked more like a villager. With his feet sandaled, her legs swathed in 
short black leggings, sheared at the ankles. His chest was completely 
exposed, revealing the cross shaped scar  over his stomach. His arms 
were clothed with a long black trench coat that did not cover his chest; 
as stated. The back of which reached down to the floor in length. 

The man was definitely Neo-Egyptian, but not from Cairo. As he came to a 
stop, the man cast his blood red eyes over the girl; his teeth 
brandished brilliantly with a defiant grin. But the prostitute knew fell 
well that this man was no interested in her. From the simple fact that 
he paid more attention to her face rather than her body.

&quot;You&#39;re new,&quot; She said with a nervous smile, &quot;What would you like?&quot;

He continued to grin. &quot;...I want you to give your soul,&quot; 

The man reached behind his back. Though the prostitute did not realize 
it beforehand, there was something at his back. A weapon. She gasped as 
he removed a long rod from his trench coat. It was a quarterstaff. Made 
with tough brown wood and garnished at both opposite ends with a silver 
capping. Every once in a while, a green streak of energy would pass 
along the length of the staff, a sort of tremor in its power.

&quot;...To the Quetzacoatl...!&quot;

The girl would have screamed, but she did not have the opportunity. The 
Neo-Egyptian man thrust his staff straight for the girl. It moved like 
lightning, ramming into her neck and reappearing on the other side 
seconds later. He ripped his quarterstaff out of her neck that very 
instant and the girl dropped to the floor, dead. The man took the bloody 
end of the powerful staff known as Quetzacoatl, put it against his lips 
and then licked the blood from it. 

That was his norm. To him, it was as sweet as honey. 

This man was Ra El Khahid. 

As a wind passed through the alleyway, his bleach-white hair danced 
along with it. Neither his red eyes nor his white hair were natural. 
These were just differences in appearance all due to the enchanting 
power of the Quetzacoatl staff. Off-shoots of the tremendous power that 
was within him thanks to the staff. And that power was still growing. It 
seemed like every person he killed built up his power. But whether it 
did or it didn&#39;t, all Ra El Khahid was concerned with was satisfying his 
dark bloodlust. His need to ingest more suffering and misery. Hundreds 
of people had been killed at his hand. Even though he had only received 
the staff little over three months ago. 

That was the power of the Quetzacoatl rod. It seemed harmless, but it 
spoke to Ra El Khahid with fierce works of darkness and evil. 

KILL

HATE

DESTROY

SUFFER

Such words echoed in his fragile mind day and night. Even when he slept 
and the staff was out of his hand. This human being had established a 
connection with a weapon that would someday bring a threat to the world. 
But neither Ra El Khahid, nor the Quetzacoatl itself knew this. All 
memories of his former peaceful life were gone. The only thing on his 
mind now was the destruction of anyone that the Quetzacoatl so chose to 
kill. 

Three months ago, Ra was a normal villager who lived in the Safe-Zone 
but outside of the cities. Now he was a demon of death. Still, every now 
and again, he would find that his mind would be attacked with memories 
of his past... 

Throughout the 11th to 20th Century there was a tribe living in Egypt 
called the &#39;Souls of Amun-Re&#39;. These people rejected evil and 
technology, remaining to themselves as a small and peaceful clan. When 
the Genesis Comet landed, the Souls of Amun-Re believed that it was a 
form of &#39;purification&#39; for the rapidly evolving humanity. The leader of 
this group was  Ra El Khahid himself. 

One day his village (called the Village of Creation) was attacked by a 
pack of roaming wolves, mutated by the radiation of the Genesis Comet. 
Ra El was powerless to stop them. So he left his village to seek help. 
He travelled south for days, until he reached a sacred temple called 
&#39;The Shrine of the Feather Snake&#39;. Ra went inside it and read one of the 
many books in the abandoned tomb. It told him a story of a demon beast 
called &#39;Quetzacoatl&#39; - the Ten-Headed Feather Snake. And how a legendary 
hero came and killed this beast before it slaughtered a village. The 
spirit of the Quetzacoatl was sealed inside the rod that the hero used. 
And the rod was entombed in that shrine. This all happened 3000 years 
ago. 

Ra believed this story, and so he stole the staff, and returned to his 
village. What he did not know was that the Quetzacoatl staff was not 
dormant. It was alive, and it polluted whoever used it with the evil 
bloodlust of Quetzacoatl spirit inside. Ra El Khahid returned to his 
village and killed all of the wolves with this new weapon. But in his 
rage he also killed half of the people in the village as well. Ra El 
Khahid fled the place of his birth, but not in shame. All he wanted was 
to expand his field for killing. Which he had been doing for the past 
three months. 

Ra El Khahid lowered Quetzacoatl from his mouth; the prostitute&#39;s blood 
staining his lips. Without a shred of remorse Ra sheathed the staff 
across his back, and then walked backwards into the darkness of the 
alleyway. That girl was just another tally on his long list. A list that 
was bound to keep growing.
