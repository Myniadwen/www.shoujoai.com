<p>“Bibliopolis,  Part Two: the Tome of Treasures.”</p>
<p><em>Yenae, the map  shows you’ve got about five free kilometers before you hit any  checkpoints. There are eight points of security separating you  from the book, and as you might expect, they become progressively  difficult to overcome. A former UCM Captain like yourself might  be able to bypass the first few, but you’ll have to force your way  through the rest. Doors three through five can be opened by a  series of codes, six and seven are protected by more advanced means,  and I believe the Interceptors protect number eight. All  right—you’ve gotten past the first door? Yes, I know—it’s  sloppy of them to keep those old codes. Stay alert—these  security devices can get pretty lethal. I’m out for now.</em></p>
<p>Lyara took a deep,  shuddering breath and let her body go limp. She had to sit down  in order to communicate telepathically—otherwise, she would  eventually crumble from the strain. Extended use of her  telepathy—that is, an hour or so without rest—caused severe  migraines and slight bleeding. Prolonged use put her into a  brief coma; she had never pushed herself past sixty-seven minutes  straight. Even these brief spurts with the six teams were  beginning to take their toll; she was glad this would be the final  mission.</p>
<p>“Are you all  right? You look ill.” Aseria ended her own transmission  and walked over to check on her distant cousin. The Valar is a  high and ancient form of elf that most of the other races revere, and  even a Sindar like Aseria, who was quite venerable in her own right,  humbled herself in Lyara’s presence. Lady Tolath did not feel  so proud or mighty as one might think, and smiled in gratitude as the  dark-skinned elf dabbed her forehead with a cool cloth.</p>
<p>“It’s just  mental strain. Telepathy’s like using any other muscle: too much and I wear myself out. I’m afraid I haven’t been  exercising it much if I wear myself out so soon.”</p>
<p>“But you are the  only one who can speak with them all,” Aseria sighed. She  knew that carrying phones or comlinks would be useless since  Bibliopolan security would jam them the instant there was a breach,  and she felt gloomy that the burden had to fall on Lyara’s  shoulders. She decided to get to know her remote relative in  order to relieve the strain, even though by this time tomorrow, they  would certainly be parted.</p>
<p>“If there is  anything I can do to ease your burden, don’t hesitate to ask. Our kind is different, special. We must look out for one  another. How did you come to join this motley crew, if I may  ask? Talking might make things more bearable.”</p>
<p>“I just need some  rest,” she breathed, “and maybe some water. If you must  know, I ran away from something back home. I had to compromise  my beliefs in order to survive, and now I’m trying to recapture  that old dream of mine. Ah, thanks—mm. That’s  better. Anyway, it seems so childish, but I wanted to see the  galaxy. I’m like Mink and Shana.” Aseria looked  bewildered.</p>
<p>“I’m  not…familiar…”</p>
<p>“Mink is the  gray-skinned girl who follows Vimmy around. I know you know who <em>she</em> is. Shana is the one who paints other people’s portraits. She’s bouncy and gregarious, and is a bit ticklish…”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, them. I still haven’t matched names with faces yet. So they share  your dream too?”</p>
<p>“We have similar  dreams,” Lyara said. “We all wanted to see the galaxy. We wanted to explore. I suppose gathering here under Miracle’s  banner was the best way to do it. Oh, I may </p>
<p>as  well warn you: don’t wander around here very much, at least  not at night. There’s a…well, I don’t know how to  describe it without sounding foolish.”</p>
<p>“Try me.” Lyara pursed her lips and stared very coldly.</p>
<p>“A ghost.”</p>
<p>“You’re  serious.”</p>
<p>“I saw it myself. It wasn’t a dream—I was too awake and aware of things for it to  be a dream. I wasn’t hallucinating either; I heard it  singing.”</p>
<p>“It sang?”</p>
<p>“A  noise came out  of it. It glowed too, more like a light than a spirit. It  looked like…oh, how can I describe it? Like a tall human  without a neck or shoulders, and great long limbs like a tree. It was  very large—no curves or anything—but I think it had eyes. I couldn’t  bear to look at it.” Aseria stood there soaking  all this in, momentarily numb, but was quickly shaken as the ship’s  monitor flickered to life. Miracle’s 4D map of Bibliopolis  showed where the crew was at any given moment in time, and Yenae’s  team was about ready to face the fifth door.</p>
<p>“It’s time. I’m going to warn them about those doors. I need you to tell  them exactly what I say. Can you do this?”</p>
<p>“I’ve recovered  enough,” she grunted, rubbing her temples and eyes.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“Get ready for a  fight,” Yenae warned her team. “According to Aseria’s  readout, there are some combat droids on the other side of this  door. Once I put in the codes, we’ll either have to look like  authorized personnel or else blast our way through.”</p>
<p>“I’ve got no  problem with that!” Allegra said. She had been overjoyed to  hear that the majority of the guards protecting this treasure were  robots; that meant she could shoot to her heart’s content and not  feel morally bleak about it. Only Kyrie and Alala shared her  enthusiasm; Kate was downright despondent and Fuuka was a bundle of  nerves. Shepherd had hoped this voyage would go on for years  and years; she had put her entire future into this dream, and now it  was breaking. As for Fuuka, it’s a doctor’s curse to be in  the midst of battle, and as talented as she was, she could only do so  much. She would just have to have faith in her comrades, faith  that they would come out all right in the end, regardless of their  reckless attitudes.</p>
<p>“The military’s  really been slacking off!” Alala observed as Yenae worked on the  keypad. “I’d’ve figured they’d be smart enough to  withhold their codes from people like you, or at least change them!”</p>
<p>“They can’t all  be sexy-cute geniuses like you,” she chuckled. Alala snarled  and kicked at the air.</p>
<p>“Just shut up and  get us through! I’m gonna kick so much ass that this whole  planet will go bankrupt from the destruction!”</p>
<p>“Please don’t  start emulating that awful snake,” Fuuka moaned.</p>
<p>“I’m not!”  Alala insisted, balling her fists. “I’m my own person and  this attitude is my own design. Hurry up, hurry up! I  wanna rip those robot apa—“</p>
<p>The  door suddenly opened, leaving Alala to gawk as the three Executioner  droids loomed over them.</p>
<p>“Ball’s in your  court, Falala,” Yenae giggled.</p>
<p>“Don’t call me  that, you beast! Otherwise I’ll do <em>this</em>!!” She scampered on all fours to the closest machine, swerving and  skidding around the blasts with incredible speed and flexibility, and  latched onto its chest with her claws. Alala screamed and  slashed at the neck, but was quickly thrown off as the machine  plucked her away. Yenae caught her and chirped; Alala wriggled  away, kicking and screaming, and went back for a rematch. Allegra was already blasting away, sinking bullets with pinpoint  accuracy, rolling and running to stay one step ahead of the  hailstorm. Yenae had a gun but she preferred her knives; she  threw a handful at the spot Alala had attacked, then leaped up and  ripped the head off with a fierce yank.</p>
<p>“Catch, Tralala!”</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck  up—whoa! Hey, don’t chuck that thing at me!! This is  serious, you evil bitch!”</p>
<p>“Then why am I  having so much fun?” she laughed. Yenae climbed down the  machine as the other two fired, most of their blasts foolishly  perforating their unfortunate comrade. She pressed her clawed  hands on the ground and shoved with her legs and tail, throwing the  ruined robot to the ground. Allegra jumped on top of it and  fired point-blank into its chest, obliterating the core.</p>
<p>“Serves you right,  ya hunk of junk! Awright, which one o’ you polecats is next?”</p>
<p>“Nyooh, I got  em’!” Alala howled and scurried after the other two, but  now Kate beat her to the punch, literally: she ripped open a  hole in the chest and pulled out the core, slamming it against the  machine’s head for a dramatic knockout. Alala roared in anger  and frustration, and as serious as the situation and as volcanic as  her temper was, she looked unbearably cute. Herut hid  underneath the legs of the final Executioner, clinging for dear life,  trying to recall everything Eve had taught her. She knew these  machines were weak in the chest, but they also had a protective  covering that rendered most direct attacks useless. She had it  in her mind to unscrew the plating, somehow, and program the machine  in their favor, even though she specialized in transports and would  not know how to go about changing.</p>
<p>“Wait, I know what  to do here!” The revelation came to her unexpectedly, and it  only would’ve happened if somebody had wrapped themselves around  the legs of those killing machines. Never one to go very far  without her toolbox, Herut went to work on the single flaw the  designers had apparently neglected, wrenching and wriggling until it  was loose. The knee caved in and the machine knelt down; Herut  sailed away; the others opened fire on the handicapped robot. She took a deep breath and smiled.</p>
<p>“And that, ladies,  is why you should always take care of your machines. You never  know when somebody’s going to take advantage of a mishap. How  does the old cliché go? ‘It’s only as strong as the  weakest link’.”</p>
<p>“Darn,” Kyrie  huffed as she helped Herut stand. “I wanted to test out my  latest incinerator. At least let me take some samples to melt  down!” Kate dragged her away without a word; Kyrie just  moaned. All that beautiful scrap going to waste!</p>
<p>The first four  security checkpoints had been easy to get through, thanks to Yenae’s  previous experience with the military and Herut’s innate knowledge  of security systems. The fifth was merely foreshadowing things  to come: the sixth and seventh doors were protected by fiendish  obstacles that only authorized personnel could get through, and the  final door, no doubt, </p>
<p>had  an Interceptor waiting for them. As Fuuka was healing the crew,  Kate reminded Kyrie of this fact, and she lit up for joy as she  realized she would have one more chance to test her devices. The sixth  room actually whetted her appetite and made Yenae glad she  had chosen the excitable inventor: it was a “fire room”  where flames shot out of large burners at irregular intervals.</p>
<p>“Oh goody!”  Kyrie sang, her wings flapping for joy. “They’re rewarding  me for my patience! Wow, lookit how high they’re going! Whoa, they’re shooting out everywhere! And they’re all  burning hot! Usually you only see these weak-ass sparks in  places like this, but <em>these</em> could melt rubber!”</p>
<p>“Just hurry up and  do whatever needs to be done,” Alala grunted. She dusted a  few stray embers from her fur and hissed; Yenae giggled and brushed  her fingers against those silky white ears, which only caused the  poor girl more grief. “Nyaaah! Only close personal  friends can touch my ears!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but  they’re so adorable!”</p>
<p>“Everyone be  quiet, please,” Fuuka said as she folded her hands: “Kyrie’s  about to take the plunge.”</p>
<p>“Ten  gold coins  says she don’t make it without screaming,” Allegra chuckled. Bets were  being made and exchanged as Kyrie braced herself; she took  the first step in the inferno and sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s so…warm!” She walked directly through the furnace without flinching or  stopping, not even when the columns of fire dashed against her skin  (as a matter of fact, she squealed and almost lost several people  their bets). She made it to the other side all right, but  almost went back “to that wonderful paradise”, only flipping the  safety lever at the behest of her agitated companions.</p>
<p>“You’re all no  fun,” she whined as they caught up with her. Yenae chuckled  and ruffled her short black hair.</p>
<p>“Thank you for  your sacrifice, Kyrie. I misjudged you, and I want to apologize  for being rude to you earlier.”</p>
<p>“Eh? When  were you rude to me?”</p>
<p>“Never mind!”  she grinned, skipping ahead of the pack. The others were  considerably quieter and merely gave their hotheaded friend a pat on  the back. Fuuka was concerned, of course, but Kyrie laughed it  off and told her she was fine.</p>
<p>“I <em>am</em> a Red, after all!” she chirped. “We live, eat, breathe, and  sleep around fire. Ahh, that was a fun two minutes! I  wish there were even <em>more</em> of these!”</p>
<p>“If only it were  that easy,” said the uneasy Kitsune.</p>
<p>The seventh room  dampened everybody’s spirits as they stared into it. They  felt they could handle anything as a team—that, by cooperating and  uniting their individual talents, they could sail through practically  anything this planet could throw at them. Didn’t they all  bear the title of Dauntless to their names? And yet some  deranged person had created a room no living creature could pass, not  even a fly or an ant or a mouse: it was impenetrable and  perfect. Lasers danced across the room, their movements  irregular, unpredictable, sometimes overlapping, closing in, opening  up to give a false impression of security, weaving and moving with  hypnotic precision… Allegra thought the team could just burst  through the room, that alarms would </p>
<p>sound  and that would be it—but when she plucked one of her hairs out and  held it next to the nearest laser, she jerked back in surprise as the  tiny follicle was scorched.</p>
<p>“Yeowch,” she  murmured. “Well, so much for that idea. Sorry y’all,  but I don’t think we’ll be goin’ any further. Not even  Kyrie could survive all this.”</p>
<p>“Leave it to me,  everyone!!” Alala screamed, cracking her knuckles noisily. She cackled so wickedly that most of the crew stepped back, wondering  what evil scheme she had in store. “They haven’t made a  trap yet that I can’t spring! Just you watch! I’ll go  through this whole room without a single scratch!”</p>
<p>“But you’re  cra—“ Yenae silenced Allegra as the feisty Felinis vaulted  into the room, curving her limbs and twisting her frame in positions  that would have been physically impossible for anyone else.</p>
<p>“Don’t even  think about doubting her,” she whispered, full of conviction. “Alala is the smartest person I’ve ever met—much smarter than  me, actually—smart enough to know exactly what she’s getting  into. What sounds like ego to you is really her supreme and  perfect confidence. I have faith that she will deliver her  promise.”</p>
<p>“But lookit this  place!” Allegra gestured. “Even if she <em>did</em> have nine lives, she’d never—“</p>
<p>“Don’t  speak. Just watch.” Allegra and the others stood spellbound as Alala  defied all reason and logic; she was almost halfway through. The lasers  slowly revolved around the room, arcing and curving and  even wiggling in strange patterns, but Alala was as fluid as water: she  curved and wove delicately, twisting her head or her arms,  lifting her leg, flexing her tail—once she had to stand perfectly  still for nearly fifteen seconds, balanced only on one hand, as the  beams of white-hot light floated precariously over her fur. Her  bones seemed to shift like rubber; her skin rippled and her fuzzy  face twisted as she took step after step, crawling and climbing over  the trap, every breath abated as this work of living, majestic art  flung her brazen attitude into the face of impossibility.</p>
<p>When she reached the  third quarter mark, Alala suddenly found herself trapped as one beam  swung back and forth directly behind her, while another rose and  fell, like the blade of a guillotine. The space in between the  two rays was so small that she had to tuck her tail between her legs,  stand perfectly straight, and give thanks that her chest was so  small; an ampler woman would’ve been scorched. She couldn’t  move because there were lasers crisscrossing in both directions,  guarding the final destination. Another laser suddenly shot  out, its beam millimeters above her scalp; Alala tensed but didn’t  dare to move, not even to duck. Three more beams shot out,  forcing her to raise both arms and one of her legs: she was now  standing with her limbs stretched out like a crane’s, a wall in  front and a wall behind, and lasers all around: she was pinned.</p>
<p>Pinned, yes, but not  defeated. “Is this the best you got?” she whispered. Suddenly she hurled herself forward, barely avoiding the dropping  light, tumbled in midair over the crisscrossing rays, jerked to the  left, and slammed her hands against the lever, shutting the lasers  off. The collective breaths of seven bold women were released,  and tensions dropped.</p>
<p>“Magnificent!”  Kate said. Yenae picked up the weary cat-girl and hugged her  for one glorious half-second before she was pushed away.</p>
<p>“Mew! No  victory snuggle for you! Everyone else is all right! MYU,  but Kate must be gentle!” Kate laughed and settled on rubbing  Alala’s shoulder; Kyrie and Allegra hugged her, while Herut settled  for a pretty smile. Once everyone was free from that room,  Fuuka stopped to examine her.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I still can’t  believe what I saw. What you did is physically impossible. You’re not even singed!”</p>
<p>“What’d I tell  ya?!” she roared proudly. “I’m the pride of Mars and the  darling of Tigris! I eat doom for breakfast and danger for  lunch! Impossible isn’t even in my dictionary!”</p>
<p>“You seem to be in  excellent spirits,” Fuuka said, laughing daintily. She bowed  and followed the rest of the crowd; Alala stopped Yenae and took her  to the side, her face slightly red. She bashfully looked down  and wring her hands, not sure how to word her thanks.</p>
<p>“Uh…I heard what  you said. I’m glad you believe in me and all, but could you  please stop teasing me? It really gets on my nerves—especially  since you seem to know how smart I really am.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I  can’t help it,” Yenae sang, reaching out to pinch Alala’s  cheeks. “You’re just too adorable! Geniuses aren’t  supposed to be this cute!”</p>
<p>“MYAAAH, I’m  sorry I ever bothered to thank you! Piss off already!” Yenae laughed and skipped after her tormented friend, her eyes fixed  on Alala’s bouncy rump.</p>
<p>“You’re even  cuter when you’re angry! And what a nice tail!”</p>
<p>“Shuddup!!”</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>“Oh dear,” Amy  sighed as she ended Lyara’s message. “I’m afraid we won’t  be able to progress very far unless we make some sacrifices. There are guards protecting the second and third checkpoints—living  people of flesh and bone.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see the  problem,” Lil shrugged. “If Aseria were here, she’d tell  us to waste them. They’re just guards; we don’t need to  feel sympathy for them.”</p>
<p>“Curse the fates  that brought our paths together!” Sharyn growled. “These  people are merely performing their duty; they adhere to their jobs  admirably. Wouldst thou be any less offended if thine own  occupation was invaded?”</p>
<p>“I still don’t  understand you, so I’ll pretend you didn’t say anything.”</p>
<p>“The two of you  just disagree,” Riene explained. “Amy, I don’t want to  fight, but if we have to…”</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s  not why I’m so concerned. If it came down to it, I’d commit  myself to any battle. It’s just…well, I’m not sure if  Miss Chandra would be willing to seduce a group of <em>men</em>. Those guards are all males, and…well…I thought this was the most  peaceful way.” She grinned sheepishly and looked at Chandra  for a reaction. That sensual ochre face expressed a variety of  emotions and none of them pertained to her normal trade.</p>
<p>“You want me…to  seduce…some men?!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” Amy  replied painfully. Despite her religion, she knew how agonizing  this would be to Chandra: it would be just like asking a  married woman to cheat on her husband, or a police officer to look  the other way, or a teacher to lie to her students. As much as  she distanced herself from homosexuality, Amy understood that Chandra  could not help the way she was wired, just as Amy herself could not  help being born into her particular family. Even those who  insisted that homosexuality was a choice could not deny Chandra’s  helplessness here. If she had been programmed “correctly”,  she would have no trouble with this order (and would have been </p>
<p>repulsed  if she had to seduce another woman), but as it stood, her world was  topsy-turvy, and Amy was asking the impossible.</p>
<p>Chandra was a  trooper, however, and agreed to Amy’s request. She was given  privacy at least, and after about ten minutes, she had successfully  manipulated the guards into letting them all pass. Her face was  considerably darker than before, though, almost as if a cloud of  guilt now hovered overhead. She had given up one of her most  basic programs for the sake of others—she had sacrificed, as Amy  worded it, and very selflessly at that—she had whored herself out,  not for pleasure or love but for duty, and if Herut had been there,  once she got over the initial shock, she might have been proud.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me  do that again,” Chandra quivered. Amy smiled and kissed her  brow.</p>
<p>“I  won’t. You did wonderfully. Hopefully the next five trials won’t be  as taxing.” Amy’s prediction did not come true, however,  although from Chandra’s point of view, they couldn’t have been  easier. She got the opportunity to look at six gorgeous women  as they struggled and fought and showed off their skills; her body  quivered with anticipation. She fully understood that desire  itself was the ultimate aphrodisiac: wanting something so  completely that it burned you on the inside excited you and stirred  your hopes into a whirlwind, until at last the purpose of your search  is within reach—but once reached, the desire is no longer potent. The  song is over, the wind has calmed, the passion cools, and the  pure act of wanting dies, leaving you hollow until that next thrill  comes round.</p>
<p>The exotic Valti  offered so much potential. She might’ve had a screw loose,  but no doubt with four extra arms, she would be a wonderful and  fulfilling lover; the possibilities in that conquest seemed as  numerous as her fingers. Chandra paid very little attention to  the beast Professor Brignor had to tame in the next room and focused  more on how her body worked, how her voice could change under the  right pressures, and how perspiration made her skin glisten. How could anyone feel disgusted with her? She had a beautiful,  wild mind, a dangerous smile, and a fairly decent body. Nobody  would ever call her a freak, least of all Chandra. She only  feared what would happen if she actually got what she wanted.</p>
<p>Rebecca Hill was an  entirely different person, and promised to offer an entirely  different experience. She was beautiful, certainly, and  slightly naïve, but also very strong and independent—but shy  as well, especially around pretty women. Chandra had definitely  noticed this trait in her companion and made note of it. Unless  Rebecca genuinely feared women, she must’ve been going through a  crisis of sexual identity, and only required the slightest nudge from  a tender lover to give her the freedom she clearly wanted. Chandra’s thoughts were stolen momentarily as they came to the next  room, where Rebecca was the star: there was a large chasm that  could only be crossed by authorized personnel, but a bit of  resourcefulness on Hill’s part saw them through.</p>
<p>She  aimed a  grappling hook at the ceiling and fired, poking a hole through the  top and tugging on the line. She assured everyone the line and  hook was strong enough to support them, and went across first to  demonstrate. But she did this sort of thing all the time; not  everyone was so accustomed to swinging across such a perilous gap.  Sharyn and Lil fearlessly crossed the chasm, and Valti volunteered to  carry Amy across, since she couldn’t imagine how an impact would  affect her injury. Chandra wanted to “carry” Riene as well,  but the soft-spoken redhead refused. It wasn’t because she  was afraid of being in Chandra’s arms—she had fantasized about  that ever since meeting the voluptuous goddess—she just doubted the  strength of the rope and hook. The ceiling had suffered several  burdens by now and looked like it was ready to break at </p>
<p>any  moment. Rebecca only had one grappling hook, however, and could  not make a fresh hole. Riene would just have to cross the gap  or be left behind.</p>
<p>“Hold on, give me  the hook.” Chandra swung alone and gave it to Rebecca, and  Riene watched her swing back to join her. The hook held—but  for how much longer? Rebecca looked Riene in the eye and laid a  hand on her arm. Memories of wandering around in the dark  together resurfaced, and Riene remembered how strong, how certain,  and how assuring that touch had been. The two shared an  unspoken bond now as Rebecca smiled at her. She would be there  whenever Riene needed her, and asked for nothing in return except a  tiny sliver of trust.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,”  Riene offered as she clung to her friend. “I’ve just never  done anything adventurous before.” The hook held as they both  swung across, and Rebecca recovered it to use another day. Chandra had observed their silent exchange and, instead of feeling  jealous or insecure, she was thrilled at the prospect of seducing  both of these ladies at the same time. She had never been with  two women simultaneously and the very thought of it put a bounce in  her step and a giddy grin on her face.</p>
<p>While  the sixth room  was certainly not an easy stroll, the seventh proved the most  challenging. The walls on both sides of the room were studded  with spikes, nails, razors, blades, and all matter of sharp objects  that could shred anything, and in the center was a raised platform  broad enough to support twelve people. On this platform was a  computer monitor with a little blinking icon on the screen, and all  those who made it this far, be they a burglar or Director of the  Cosmic Military, had to access the computer to get any farther. Lil  fancied herself a decent hacker and turned the program on, but as  soon as she touched the keyboard, the walls started closing in.</p>
<p>“What the hell did  you just do?” Valti demanded.</p>
<p>“I turned the  friggin’ thing on, that’s what I did! I didn’t see any  others doors and I thought—“</p>
<p>“Never mind! What does it say?” Lil squinted but couldn’t make anything  out of the strange characters. She only knew a handful of  languages, and nothing here looked familiar.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. It’s gobbledygook.”</p>
<p>“It’s Russian,”  Riene said. She nudged herself next to Lil and quickly scanned  the message. “It says we have to answer five riddles before  we can continue. Anyone who made it this far would know the  answers, but we’ll have to figure them out ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Thank  goodness we’ve got a team of geniuses,” Lil grumbled. “So  what’s this one say?”</p>
<p>“‘I  am in the sky, by and by. When I am close, you cannot look, but far  away, I am everywhere. Yet when I am close, things are  brightest—darkness reigns far away! What am I?’”</p>
<p>“The hell?”</p>
<p>“Stars,” Amy  answered. Riene keyed it in and the screen changed to a  different language. The walls also pulled back and slowed down,  but only by a fraction.</p>
<p>“Thank goodness!”  Sharyn sighed. “It appears we should conquer this trial with  teamwork—but thou art our savior, Lady Riene!”</p>
<p>“Quiet,” she  murmured, her cheeks reddening. The next riddle was in Arabic,  and read, “‘Net-maker  I, patiently I fly, yet with no wings. Smaller than thou, yet elder,  the octave of my step echoes quietly when I hunt. What am I?’”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A spider!”  Allegra shouted. The walls jerked back and slowed again, but  the fraction was lessened. Soon the distance was no longer  comfortable. The screen changed again, but Riene was  interrupted.</p>
<p>“I  know this  language,” Lil exclaimed as she read the ancient letters of Mu: “‘I  am seed, I am flesh, I am soul, yet I never live. I can take any  shape, I can penetrate air, I can transform. I am life, and death,  and spirit. What am I?’ It’s water.” The walls merely stopped now, only  for a  moment, and came closer and closer after their temporary respite. The  blades were now near enough to touch. The fourth riddle was  written in an obscure language that only a fanatical linguist would  understand; even Riene had trouble translating it.</p>
<p>“‘I  can weigh every world, yet I am light. I can broaden any horizon, yet  I am small. I contain knowledge, yet it is never mine. What am I?’” She rubbed her eyes and blurted, “A book!” The walls did  not even pause now; they kept rolling closer, forcing everyone to  stand in single file. Valti hissed sharply as several of the  points brushed up against her skin.</p>
<p>“Hurry it up  there, or we’ll all be shish kabob!”</p>
<p>“This isn’t  something you can rush!” Riene snapped as she gazed at the final  riddle. This was in a language she did not understand. Her mind rushed through all the possible dialects she had studied,  sprinting through the catalogue of two-hundred recognized galactic  languages and a thousand minor tongues, only a portion of which she  had mastered. If she had hours to spare, a computer, and a  notepad, she might have been able to unlock this puzzle, but since  she had none of these, she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>“Any ideas?” The team’s morale depleted rapidly as they all suddenly felt the  icy touch of death wash over them. Rebecca reached out to  comfort her defeated friend, Valti and Sharyn quickly went to work  trying to hold the wall back, and Chandra grabbed Lil and smothered  her, desperate for one final affectionate embrace (she was shoved  away and nearly punctured). Amy stayed calm and removed her  glasses, glaring coldly at the screen. She whispered something  that sounded inhuman and unfamiliar (this was the best description  anyone could come up with at the time), then spoke a single word:</p>
<p>“Love. The  password is love.” Lil wriggled away from Chandra and  nervously typed it in; she had no choice but to trust in her. Her faith was rewarded as the walls drew back and a hidden door on  the opposite side of the room opened. The women were too eager  to leave the room to ask Amy how she knew what the answer was, but  once they were free and safe, all eyes turned her way. As  always, she smiled meekly and humbly refused any praise.</p>
<p>“I only know two  languages, so don’t think I’m anything special. I just  happened to recognize that one. It’s an ancient  Earth-language that not many people know. I picked out a few  words and…cobbled together the rest. I knew the riddle, in  any case.”</p>
<p>“Sounds more like  you were gambling with our lives,” Lil snorted. Sharyn  smacked and rebuked her; Valti dragged them all away so they could  proceed with their mission. Even though they were all  cooperating and would be paid regardless of who got to the book  first, more than a few women were starting to feel competitive.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>No matter what the  teams experienced or overcame before arriving at the eighth and final  security checkpoint, they all had the face the same adversary before  proving themselves worthy </p>
<p>of  the treasured tome. There were three different paths to take in  order to reach the book, and therefore, there were three  Interceptor-class battle droids guarding the final checkpoint. Naja and  her crew felt fully confident that they could overcome these  machines, and Yenae’s team, in spite of their friction, was just as  enthusiastic (particularly Kyrie, who was told she could “incinerate  at will”). Amy’s team had also forged strong bonds through  the trials and tribulations; they were all a little stronger now that  they had been tested, but one last obstacle still stood in their way,  and it was the most difficult by far.</p>
<p>The Interceptors are  superior to Executioners in quality, performance, strength, and  endurance, but they are so difficult to produce and even harder to  maintain that they are usually reserved for the very wealthy. Even a planet like Bibliopolis, which prided itself on security,  could not afford more than three—but the governors were certain  that they would not need any more to protect their valuables. And their confidence was certainly well-placed: even with seven  against one, all three of the teams were in for the fights of their  lives.</p>
<p>The Interceptors  wasted no time: it opened fire after verifying that none of the  visitors matched any records in its system. The machine had a  helicopter’s body, legs like an elephant, the wheels of a truck,  two chain guns, a missile launcher with twenty shells to fire, a  flame thrower on the rear, a buzz-saw for close combat, two clawed  arms, and armor thick enough to survive direct fire from all but the  most devastating weapons. Its weight was its only weakness, and  because it couldn’t give chase even with its wheels, the  Interceptors usually remained stationary and relied on their weapons  to hunt intruders down. There was very little cover in the  hallway, and the only other door led to the wall with spikes. Rebecca and Riene immediately returned fire but their guns were  completely ineffective.</p>
<p>“Shit,”  Lillianne hissed. “Anybody got any brilliant ideas?”</p>
<p>“Corrosion would  be my only suggestion,” Valti said. “If I could figure out  what that thing’s made out of…”</p>
<p>“The guns  themselves wouldn’t have any protection,” Rebecca said as she  reloaded. “The metal can’t be too heavy or else it would  affect the aim, and any sort of protective veneer would interfere  with the cooling system. I say take those out first.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps  we should  seek better refuge first!” Sharyn yelled. Everyone dove for  cover as a missile blasted the wall they were hiding behind, reducing  it to a smoking crater. A second missile obliterated the  remains, and slowly, the Interceptor closed the gap between them.  Bullets sprayed everywhere, keeping the women incapacitated; they  weren’t even afforded a split second to retaliate. Even so,  Rebecca tossed a bomb and prayed it would do some damage, but the  Interceptor grabbed it while it was in midair and threw it harmlessly  to the side.</p>
<p>“Is that your  little game, now?” Valti snickered. Since nobody had called  her suggestion a crazy idea, she fished through her pockets for a  vial of corrosive acid. The weaker agents would do little more  than singe away the finish, but she threw them anyway. The  claws were too strong to properly grip the flying beakers, and the  acid broke and burnt the metallic hands. She handed several  more vials to Lil and suggested they alternate throwing and firing.  Rebecca disposed another bomb just as three vials sailed through the  air; the Interceptor caught two, got its hands burned, and tried  shooting the third out of the air. It exploded quite messily,  flinging smoke and embers everywhere.</p>
<p>“Petroleum!” Valti cackled. But the Interceptor was still intact and was  getting nearer. The thing was incredibly slow and only seemed  able to move its arms; the rest of the body was about as mobile as a  stone. Valti wanted to take advantage of this sluggishness, but  before she could pull anything from her six sleeves, Lil raised her  hands and glared intently.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Ssh! Lyara’s telling me something! Aseria has an idea, but it’s  going to be really messy, and odds are, one of us is going to get  hurt. But she guarantees it will work.”</p>
<p>“Allow me the  risk, if this be our only choice,” Sharyn said. Lil shook her  head and refused.</p>
<p>“No, she wants me  to do it. The rest of you, just do what I tell you.”</p>
<p>“How do we know  this isn’t just your way of slaughtering us?” Rebecca snorted.</p>
<p>“Do you really  think I’d go through all this trouble if I wanted to kill you <em>now?</em> I’ve got no reason to, you jackass! Now shut up and do as  you’re told! You—knight! How much impact can that  armor sustain?”</p>
<p>“The Lesser Armor  is capable of withstanding a direct blow from a B-class Void dragon  and an indirect blow from an A-class. The Noble Armors are much  more—“</p>
<p>“Wow,  really? Are you serious?” Lillianne Markus wasn’t usually  impressed, especially with a wide-eyed reject from the Renaissance,  but there was no mistaking her surprise now. “You should’ve  told me that before!” she laughed. “This’ll make things a  lot easier. Get directly in front of me. Valti, I’m  going to need you to hand me some of your most potent acids. You,  bounty hunter! Take the librarian’s guns and cover me. The rest of you,  stay out of my way!”</p>
<p>Even  though Riene felt insulted, she trusted that their strategist knew  what she was doing and slinked away. Sharyn jumped into the  storm and shielded her exposed skin as Lil stood directly behind her,  throwing three vials of acid at once. The bullets bounced off  Sharyn’s armor, shoving her back as its amazing strength was  dented, but she stood her ground. The two claws reached out to  swat the acid away—the Interceptor had learned not to grab them—and  as it prepared to cut the third one down, Rebecca shot it, igniting  the flames. The buzz-saw melted into liquid and the guns were  subsequently destroyed as the two scrapped beakers burst open  suddenly, thanks to a device Valti had invented “for just such an  occasion”.</p>
<p>“You  truly frighten me,” Riene admitted as the six-armed mad scientist  cackled. With the guns out of the way, it was only a matter of  grappling the Interceptor. The team rushed in to fight at close  range, Rebecca fixing the last of her bombs to the flame thrower and  smiling as she blew it right off. Sharyn cut the missile  launcher in half before it could throw any more shells, and Lil gave  it a ferocious kick, sending it crashing onto its back. It  sprang back to its feet and wheeled after them, its claws still  swinging, hardly a dent in its armor.</p>
<p>“I  don’t suppose that butter-knife of yours can cut through this  monster,” Lil muttered. Sharyn humbly shook her head. “Lyara, how does Aseria propose we…oh, right, I guess it could  work. Val, Aseria wants you to burn away its joints.”</p>
<p>“I  don’t have any vials left,” she grunted as she sifted through her  pockets.</p>
<p>“No  bombs on my end,” Rebecca sighed. Lil was just about to give  up when Sharyn ran right at the battle droid, hacking the arms and  legs apart with every swing of her sword. She could not harm  its armored exterior, but she could debilitate it, and after a few  rough slashes, there was nothing left but a helpless body and several  mutilated limbs. Lil ran her fingers through her hair and  growled.</p>
<p>“What  other secrets ya got hidden? Oh, who cares—at least the damn  thing’s busted. Let’s get moving!”</p>
<p>Amy was the only one  there who was excused from being exhausted. Not even Lillianne  was cruel enough to expect the handicapped secretary to fight, so  once everyone passed the </p>
<p>eighth  door, she tended to their wounds as best as she could, even though  moving around pained her. She was blessed to be in the company  of so many experienced amateur physicians: Sharyn already knew  the basics and could almost pass for a nurse; Rebecca had years of  training from her aunt and plowed right in, ignoring her superficial  burns and scratches. Chandra was only too happy to massage sore  muscles, and Valti passed around several pills and tablets she had  been keeping for just such an occasion (they were all refused, of  course).</p>
<p>“I just hope  everyone else made out okay,” Riene sighed.</p>
<p>“I’m  sure they  made out just fine,” Chandra chirped. More than a few people  blushed as they understood the double-meaning of those words. The  breather took about seven or eight minutes out of their schedule,  but it couldn’t be helped. Once everyone was healthy enough  to press on, Lil was given the honor of opening the final door and  leading the team through the hallway to the treasure they had been  seeking. The book itself was fairly anticlimactic—it was  little more than a skinny bluish manuscript with fully interactive  holographic pages and a lock that prevented any unwanted intruders  from peeking in. Books made out of paper had been abolished  centuries ago in favor of these longer-lasting devices, which could  survive both time and the elements.</p>
<p>The  group was surprised to learn that they had arrived first, but a quick  message from Lyara assured them that their companions were okay.  Everyone had destroyed their respective Interceptors and was taking a  break; they had just arrived later and would be joining Amy’s team  in a few minutes. Sharyn debated whether or not they should  wait and capture the prize together, and in the end, her decision won  out and the seven women took an extended rest.</p>
<p>“So  just what’s inside that book that’s so damned important?” Lil  wondered.</p>
<p>“I’m  not sure myself,” Amy admitted. “Most people don’t even  know it exists, let alone what’s inside it. When I asked, my  master just told me it was called <em>The  Tome of Treasures</em>. I’ll let you decide what that means.”</p>
<p>“Probably  some lame-ass self-help book about how ‘life is a treasure,’ or  some shit like that. Hey, how bout’ another question? How’d you and that freak Miracle get together?” This one  took Amy a moment to consider. She removed her glasses and  cleaned them; her eyes had a far-off look in them, something akin to  nostalgia, when a distant and distinct memory is drawn up and looked  at again. These sorts of memories are not always good, but they  definitely stay with you forever.</p>
<p>“It  was…a chance occurrence,” she murmured. “It’s very hard  to describe. I sort of…found them. We accepted each  other. That’s the best way I can explain it. You could  say that the <em>Dauntless</em> and Dr. Miracle came together in the same package.”</p>
<p>“Is  that a fact?” She stared at Amy suspiciously but the petite  woman revealed nothing else that could incriminate her story—in  fact, she resumed smiling and even stood up with some assistance. Naja  and Yenae were bringing their teams down the hallway, and though  they all still looked weary, the glow of victory was on their faces.  Amy grabbed the book, Herut cracked the lock, and the Acheron twins  rigged a transport to deliver them out of the city: mission  accomplished.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p></p>
<p>By the time the <em>Dauntless</em> flew out of orbit and penetrated the endless veil of the heavens, it  was so late that everyone decided to go to bed and worry about their  payment in the morning. Some people were more restless than  others, however, particularly those that feared this would be their  last chance to take advantage of a good opportunity. Eve  Kasberry was among their number; the realization that this was “the  end” overwhelmed her with loneliness and desperation. She  didn’t like being around people, and yet more than anything else,  she wanted to be part of a group, to belong and to be loved  regardless of who she was or what she did. This aggravating  dichotomy was not really the root of her suffering but it did result  in her strife. Desperation oozed out of this frightening  sensation and she went to see Chandra, the only person she believed  capable of fulfilling her needs. She whispered a remorseful  apology to Herut before knocking on the door and numbly stepping in.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview  of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Sharyn: What a pitiable fate! To begin this quest with such zeal, only to  lose all in haste! Wherefore hast the journey ended so soon?</p>
<p>Lil: Beats me, but at least now, Aseria and I can get back to shamelessly  flirting with each other.</p>
<p>Valti: We still have to get paid, though. I can’t believe this job  is over already. I thought it’d go on a lot longer.</p>
<p>Sharyn: I suppose t’was folly to doubt impermanence. Prithee, attend  to the chapter where the crew is compensated for their work, and  perhaps a story may yet be scratched out from the aftermath.</p>
<p>Lil: Huh? Amy’s got something to tell us? What kinda secrets  are behind this charade, anyway?</p>
<p>Valti: You’ll have to stay tuned for “The Real Journey Begins at Last: Huh?”</p>
<p>Sharyn: With every question cometh deeper inquiries to make…</p>
