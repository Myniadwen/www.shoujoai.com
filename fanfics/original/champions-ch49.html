<a href="../original/champions-ch48.html">Back to Part 48</a><pre>The Storm

The day started like any other&#151;people dragging themselves out of bed, 
some considerably earlier than others, and morning routines circled away 
as the first bright lights of dawn came into view. Everybody made sure 
they had a good breakfast; some people had theirs outdoors, wondering if 
this would be the last sunrise they would ever see. The sky was calm and 
scattered with clouds; the sun above and the city just on the horizon 
seemed peaceful as well. Nobody really doubted that there was going to 
be a war, but a few hoped. Horrors did not come on nice mornings like 
this.

Even Yohko Kamaguchi and some of the MERCS staff came outside to bask in 
the glow of dawn. Kamaguchi kept her eyes on the city, like she could 
really see what was happening. Those people there wouldn&#39;t evacuate, she 
knew&#151;they would stampede. There would be riots, rampages, lootings, 
fires galore, and lots of blood spilt. If what she had heard was true, 
then she could surmise that as more people died, more undead would be 
made from their bodies to add strength to the army. It was a losing 
battle, right from the beginning, and she would be right in the middle 
of it. For the first time, Yohko would fight, but being no warrior, she 
had a more subtle method of attack.

&quot;It&#39;s so peaceful,&quot; said Yui, wrapping a jacket around herself. &quot;Hard to 
believe that soon this place will be a living Hell. I&#39;m so scared, I 
can&#39;t even feel the fear anymore. Do you think a person can just 
experience emotions so powerful that they overload their bodies and send 
them into a vegetative state?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s possible,&quot; Yohko replied. Noticing how cold Yui was, she 
drew her best friend to her and held the shivering woman. She herself 
soon felt the chill, and suddenly, the temperature spiked down to an 
unbearable degree. Yohko&#39;s breath came out in mighty puffs, her teeth 
chattered violently, and even her blood seemed to freeze. But it wasn&#39;t 
just her: the whole world seemed frozen. Dewy grass turned icy, the 
windows of the MERCS building thickened with frost, and any and all 
bodies of liquid turned solid as the mysterious weather cursed the land.

&quot;What the devil is this?&quot; moaned Yohko, too cold to keep her composure. 
She hurried inside, Yui and the staff following suit, but there was no 
use: even indoors, with all the windows blocked and the heat turned as 
high as it could go, everything was chilly. Kailin looked the worst. 
Since she relied on warm conditions to activate her flames, there was 
nothing she could do but shiver and become pale. She had tried, of 
course, but moving around only seemed to make things worse. Nobody had 
any idea what was going on&#151;winter wasn&#39;t for awhile, and there had been 
no cold fronts announced on the news, at least none this brutal. It was 
like...

&quot;Listen!&quot; hissed Setsuka, the mere whisper of her words turning cloudy. 
&quot;Do you hear that?&quot; Everyone perked their ears, and in spite of the 
cold, they heard what she had detected. Howling, moaning, wailing, 
weeping, the screams of the damned&#151;and above it all, a sound like 
deathly wind, its very touch poison. Then came the most awful resonance 
of all: a blood-curdling cry, so loud that it shattered the windows and 
brought the merciless arctic wind indoors. If an enormous colossus had 
raked his fingernails across an enormous blackboard, it wouldn&#39;t have 
come close to this level of agony, this single, long, shriek of 
indescribable horror.

Then, slowly, the sound became silent. The howling ceded. Even the cold 
became mild, and the weather returned to normal. Kailin sighed with 
relief, and everyone soon followed her example, like the whole world had 
held its breath. Everyone looked shaken from the experience, and some 
were still a little blue in the face, but only Alicia seemed unaffected. 
Or, to be more accurate, she seemed the most interested in the strange 
happenings. She wheeled forward, staring at the ceiling&#151;like she was 
watching whatever had made that awful noise.

&quot;It...can&#39;t be,&quot; she murmured indistinctly. Even the sharpest ears 
didn&#39;t hear her, but anyone could see there was something amiss. Amielle 
went up to her; Alicia snapped out of her musings and assumed a smile, 
though not a happy one.

&quot;Anybody got any idea what that was?&quot; grunted Mora.

&quot;How the hell should I know?&quot; answered Sanaa. She sighed and rubbed her 
face. &quot;Anybody seen Mr. Pochanski? I want to ask him when these 
so-called Savage Six will arrive.&quot;

......

They came not long after. Pochanski had been outside waiting for them 
until the sudden cold attacked, and dove inside to wait it out. He 
trembled at the sound of the howling, and no word could describe his 
feeling upon surviving the more awful shriek that followed. He emerged 
all by himself, where nobody could see his frightened state, and tried 
to calm himself as he waited for his old comrades. Eventually he spotted 
their jet, and smiled with nostalgia at all the wonderful and terrible 
adventures they had had together. As it landed, he waved them down and 
greeted them with spread-out arms. They each emerged from the jet, and 
together, embraced their old friend.

Introductions to the main group were made later: &quot;These are the Savage 
Six,&quot; said Pochanski, indicating them all. But there were only four 
there, aside from himself. One was absent. Thunder-Claw, apparently the 
expert on the famous group, pointed this out.

&quot;Sir, there&#39;s one missing. And if I&#39;m not mistaken, it&#39;s your leader, 
Captain Amazing.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes. He&#39;s...retired.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; A knot of uncertainty tightened Steve&#39;s throat. Pochanski 
introduced his remaining four friends to everyone, briefly detailing 
their powers as well.

&quot;First, meet Paradox, the human impossibility. I couldn&#39;t possibly 
detail his powers, but let&#39;s just say that he can bend the laws of 
physics to his will. Next, meet Morpheus, King of Dreams. Many times 
he&#39;s saved us with his sleep-inducing powers. Now we have an individual 
known only as The Shift, a person who can assume the identities of 
anyone he, or she meets. Even we don&#39;t know Shift&#39;s true gender. 
Finally, we have Lady Wonder, and never has a name been more apt. When I 
was with them, I was known as Priest, and as I mentioned, the sixth 
member of our crew, Captain Amazing, is in retirement.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t he know about the situation?&quot; asked Steve. Pochanski and the 
other four sighed.

&quot;We tried convincing him, you know, but the poor old fool just wouldn&#39;t 
listen. &#39;My mind&#39;s made up,&#39; he said. &#39;I&#39;m retired, and there&#39;s nothing 
that can pull me back into the game. Besides, I&#39;m too old and worn-out 
to be of any use.&#39; There&#39;s no arguing with him once he starts sounding 
like that.&quot;

&quot;Is he aware of Anvil&#39;s resurrection?&quot; At the mere mention of their most 
powerful enemy, the Savage Six froze, and stared in amazement. Pochanski 
frowned, rubbing his bald head as if he now carried the weight of the 
world on his shoulder.

&quot;Jake, you never told us about that,&quot; said Lady Wonder. Pochanski 
nodded.

&quot;I know. I didn&#39;t want to say anything until I knew for certain. Knowing 
our enemies, I&#39;d figure they&#39;d discover him eventually, and bring him 
back to haunt us all. Stevenson,&quot; he called, standing up suddenly.

&quot;Y-yes sir?&quot;

&quot;If we tell Captain Amazing that Anvil has returned, no doubt he will 
come back. I&#39;d like to go visit him myself; the rest of the Six should 
stay here and plan for the battle. Would you like to come with me?&quot;

&quot;Would I?!&quot; he squealed. &quot;For the honor of meeting the greatest hero of 
all time, just try and stop me!!&quot; He didn&#39;t even say goodbye to his 
friends as he raced off towards the jet. A lot of people thought this 
was very rude, but if anybody honestly knew him, they wouldn&#39;t have 
gotten mad. Stevenson McCray had grown up idolizing the Savage Six (and 
all the other &quot;old school&quot; superheroes), and spent his life modeling 
after them. It was what ultimately led him to join that fight, although 
his lineage helped as well. Xianq and Sally, those he was closest to, 
looked at each other and pouted. Boys!

......

Now that he was retired, Gaul Deeds&#151;better known as Captain 
Amazing&#151;could afford to live in peace and quiet. The old man had a fine 
lakeside mansion, filled with libraries and ballrooms, rooms for music 
and rooms for writing, rooms for his guests and rooms for himself, and 
even a room for all his gardening needs, a greenhouse. A servant led 
Pochanski and McCray inside, where they were directly escorted to one of 
the smaller reading rooms. Inside was the man they were looking for, a 
fellow early into his sixties with graying hair and a face lined from 
decades of adventures. There was a merry fire lit in the room, casting a 
soft orange glow against this most amazing individual.

&quot;Ah, Jacob,&quot; said he, standing up with some effort. He embraced 
Pochanski lovingly and kissed the man&#39;s cheek. &quot;It&#39;s been too long,&quot; he 
said, taking a studious look at the priest. &quot;Come, sit. I&#39;ve just poured 
myself some whiskey; would you care for some?&quot;

&quot;No, my friend, we won&#39;t be here for long.&quot;

&quot;Then sit at least. And who is this young man you&#39;ve brought?&quot; Pochanski 
introduced him, but Steve was aghast with delight. He had never realized 
how close he had been to one of his idols, and now that he was meeting 
the very leader of the team, he could do little but hold his mouth wide 
open and pump the old man&#39;s fist.

&quot;It is...a delight...to be in your presence, sir!&quot; he gushed. &quot;Could I 
trouble you for an autograph? I&#39;m a huge fan!&quot;

&quot;Always with the autographs,&quot; smiled Deeds happily. He reached for 
something to write with (and on), and mused to himself as he scrawled 
his name. &quot;I see the younger generation still remembers what we did, eh 
Jake? That&#39;s good. The world must never forget us.&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t, friend,&quot; he assured him. &quot;But now I must be serious with 
you. Do you know why we&#39;ve come?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I know all about it,&quot; he waved dismissively. &quot;I saw the Summoning. 
I even spoke with Morpheus and Shift about it. I&#39;ll tell you what I told 
them: I will not participate in this war. I am retired, and I am happy 
to leave the world in more capable hands.&quot;

&quot;But sir, what about your responsibility as a superhero? What about your 
vow to protect humanity? What about all that? Are you just going to 
ignore it?&quot;

&quot;Son,&quot; sighed the old man, &quot;I have given my life doing everything you 
say and more. I think all my years of service has entitled me to a bit 
of rest. Besides, if the world is in such dire peril, I don&#39;t see what 
use an old guy like me could do. I&#39;ve already lost most of my edge, and 
being out there in the middle of a crowd of young people would only make 
me embarrass myself. I&#39;d just get in the way.&quot;

&quot;But sir, I beg you! You don&#39;t know how horrible this is going to be!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, young man, but there&#39;s nothing you can say that will 
convince me.&quot; Steve&#39;s face sunk, crestfallen. The Savage Six just 
wouldn&#39;t be the same without their illustrious leader&#151;and how could he 
abandon his old friends in their hour of need, not to mention the human 
population? Fortunately, Jacob knew his old friend better, and knew just 
what to say to stir him out of his state.

&quot;Gaul, Anvil has returned.&quot;

&quot;Anvil?!&quot; Deeds immediately stood up like a bolt despite his age, and 
his eyes&#151;so sleepy and warm two seconds ago&#151;now burned with intensity 
and fear. He shivered and drew his hands up to his mouth, covering it as 
he dared conceive the impossible. &quot;Anvil... But that&#39;s impossible, we 
killed him ourselves.&quot;

&quot;I know we did. There are two necromancers amongst the villains. They 
managed to bring him back.&quot; This was not completely certain yet, but no 
doubt that if Malchior or Kissa got word of Anvil&#39;s infamous history, 
they would do everything they could to include him in the roster. Gaul 
Deeds took awhile to absorb this, but when he came to terms with it all, 
a new determination was set in his soul.

&quot;I wanted to live the rest of my life in peace and quiet, but now that 
that monster has returned, I will gladly don my uniform once more to 
bring him down. And this time, he will stay dead! Gentlemen,&quot; he 
addressed them, &quot;give me but a quarter hour to suit up, and you will 
have Captain Amazing on your side once again.&quot; Pochanski and McCray 
looked at each other and smiled victoriously. At last, the Savage Six 
would be reunited, and they would have their fighting chance.

......

While Pochanski and McCray were gone, the four remaining members of the 
Six gathered everyone together for battle plans. After taking a head 
count, they came up with twenty-seven people and six to lead them all. 
They had wanted to divide everyone evenly, but there was no way to do 
this.

&quot;Ideally, we could use five teams of five,&quot; said Lady Wonder, going over 
a list of the available members and their respective powers. &quot;But that 
leaves two out.&quot; She looked over at Yohko and Soma, the last-minute 
additions, almost as if she blamed them for upsetting the balance.

&quot;We can just go with the Priest,&quot; said Yohko. &quot;Pandora and I are used to 
working together anyway, and I think being with him would make us both 
at ease.&quot;

&quot;Yes, we&#39;ve heard enough of your malcontent and discomfort towards us,&quot; 
muttered Cobra. Morpheus put his hand on her shoulder, calming her.

&quot;Let&#39;s save the feuding for the war. Right now we need to assign people 
to their units. I ask you all, what do we need?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s definitely a call for aerial maneuvers,&quot; said Lady Wonder, the 
only one aside from Captain Amazing who could fly. &quot;I&#39;ll lead the 
air-strike team, so I&#39;ll need people who are familiar with the skies. 
G-Force, you and Skye should be my main offense force; Butterfly, you&#39;re 
just as good since most of your forces are airborne.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; said Joyce, tugging on the old woman&#39;s arm, &quot;please don&#39;t 
separate Sarah and I. I&#39;ll go with her. I promise I won&#39;t be a burden. I 
know I can&#39;t fly, but...please?&quot; Lady Wonder looked at the young girl 
doubtfully&#151;she really didn&#39;t like sending kids into these things, but 
Joyce had volunteered, and she was probably safer with them anyway.

&quot;All right, but you&#39;ll have to be careful. Spoon Man, I overheard you 
saying you&#39;d like to protect these girls if they managed to get in the 
same party&#151;well, now&#39;s your chance. You&#39;re with me.&quot; He seemed pleased 
with this (although regrettably, the venerable heroine was far too old 
for him to flirt with) and shook hands on it.

&quot;Next, we&#39;ll need a covert team to sneak through the city and strike 
quickly,&quot; said the Shift. &quot;Naturally, I&#39;ll lead this one. Lurker, 
Stalker, I&#39;m assuming you don&#39;t have those names for your health, so 
I&#39;ll let you be in my squad. Sanaa, you&#39;ll be my second in command. Lady 
Snowblood, I&#39;d like your skills of premonition on my team as well, and 
Ferret...what could I do without you?&quot; Joanna merely blushed, happy that 
somebody thought so highly of her (and it was such an androgynous 
character, too!).

&quot;We need a team that can dish out damage while absorbing the brunt of 
the enemy&#39;s attack,&quot; Morpheus stated. &quot;Now I know I&#39;m no tank myself, 
but being able to put my foes to sleep is a skill not to be laughed at. 
Ronin, BK Power, Rancor, I&#39;d like for you two to join me. I&#39;ll also take 
Siren and Inferno; we may need them to clear out the undead.&quot; The girls 
understood, and were happy to be paired with people of similar 
experience and design. Finally, it came Paradox&#39;s turn.

&quot;I&#39;d like more of a specialty team,&quot; he said enigmatically. &quot;A team 
that&#39;s more or less a wild card, like me. Disintegrator, I like your 
style, so you&#39;ll be with me. Psyche, no doubt I&#39;ll have use for you. 
Technomancer, it&#39;d be an honor to work with you. Lady Luck, I&#39;m sure we 
could use you extensively. Guardian Angel, it would please me a great 
deal to have your eyes.&quot; The girls were happy to comply, but the others 
felt left out.

&quot;No doubt that Father Pochanski will be able to bring Captain Amazing to 
our side,&quot; Cobra noted. &quot;We&#39;re going to need a varied team if we hope to 
keep up with the leader, and it won&#39;t get more varied than this!&quot; Venom, 
Bubblegum Black, and Alicia (who was not in her &quot;Pale&quot; form yet for 
obvious reasons) agreed with this, and said they wouldn&#39;t mind working 
with Thunder-Claw once he returned.

It didn&#39;t even take half an hour after the groups were assigned for 
Pochanski, McCray, and Captain Amazing himself to return. The old leader 
greeted his comrades warmly and apologized for being so stubborn&#151;and 
once again, the Savage Six were whole. The newcomers were filled in on 
everything&#151;the Captain was quite content to have those five people on 
his team, and Jacob, now known as Priest, thought it a good idea to keep 
his eyes on Yohko and Pandora. Now that everyone was together, the real 
planning could begin.

&quot;The forces we managed to gather are waiting at their designated posts,&quot; 
reported Paradox mysteriously. &quot;Most of them are seasoned veterans, and 
we had their assurance that they&#39;d be fine on their own. For those that 
were still new, we paired them up in their own teams. We&#39;re trusting 
many people to carry out a lot of complex orders!&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ll be fine,&quot; Morpheus replied. &quot;These are Priest&#39;s friend and 
allies, so we will guide them first. Now that we&#39;ve assigned our teams, 
we should think about where to put them. Priest, are we going to defend 
this base?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s far on the outskirts of the city, so it&#39;s not likely to be 
attacked. Just in case, Yohko has alerted the staff to abandon the base 
once we leave, so everybody, make sure you brought everything you need. 
We may never see this place again.&quot;

&quot;And good riddance if you ask me,&quot; murmured Stalker, ever pleasant. He 
ignored her. Captain Amazing himself detailed the plans for his fellow 
heroes, and spoke more like a General before a war than a retired old 
man.

&quot;Lady Wonder, since you&#39;ll be patrolling the skies, I suggest starting 
out on the eastern side of the city. You can then sweep inside and take 
account of the whole place, and circle around as often as necessary. 
Paradox, keep your team on the west so they can cut off any escape 
routes. Morpheus, we&#39;ve been told that the forces will be coming in from 
the north, so we&#39;ll need your team there to withstand the first few 
waves. My team will act as defense and will cover your team from the 
center of the city. Priest, Shift, your teams will have to make their 
own strategies; you&#39;ll be on your own. You are the only ones who will 
not concentrate on attack or defense.&quot;

&quot;Understood.&quot; The Captain took a huge breath, and held his hand out over 
the plans.

&quot;I am but one of six. I am strength and I am will, but I am nothing on 
my own.&quot; Morpheus then placed his hand over his leader&#39;s, and replied in 
suit.

&quot;I am but one of six. I am skill and I am prudence, but I am nothing on 
my own.&quot; Now Paradox placed his hand over Morpheus&#39;, and one by one, the 
Savage Six rallied together for what they expected to be their final 
moment of glory.

&quot;I am but one of six. I am thoughtful and I am bold, but I am nothing on 
my own.&quot;

Lady Wonder: &quot;I am but one of six. I am swift and I am brave, but I am 
nothing on my own.

Shift: &quot;I am but one of six. I am stealth and I am secret, but I am 
nothing on my own.&quot;

Priest: &quot;I am but one of six. I am wisdom and I am caution, but I am 
nothing on my own.&quot;

&quot;But together,&quot; they all chanted, &quot;we are unstoppable.&quot; They broke, and 
with a grim smile, the Captain dismissed them.

&quot;Good luck, and may God have mercy on our foes.&quot;

............

Sally Redinger rode on the wake of the more experienced Lady Wonder as 
she and the rest of Team Aero flew towards the city, searching for their 
enemy. They didn&#39;t know if there were going to be very many air battles, 
but it was good to be prepared, and besides, it was always nice having a 
hero in the sky ready to catch you, or dive down and smite enemies from 
above. Along with Skye, who could sprout dragon&#39;s wings and soar like 
the ancient, mythical beasts, there was an entire legion of insect 
species covering the sky, all of them under the orders of young 
Butterfly. The other two members of Team Aero, Phobia and Spoon Man, 
were on the surface acting as backup, and Lady Wonder had gathered 
several hundred other heroes along the way.

&quot;Team Aero,&quot; came Wonder&#39;s voice over their shared headsets, &quot;I&#39;ve 
picked up a large group of enemies, sighted almost dead ahead. Looks to 
be aerial, so we&#39;ll have the honor of taking them out first. Sky team, 
move into attack position and get ready. Ground team, cover us from 
below. When we get in range, I&#39;ll try to fly across the main enemy line 
and draw their fire. That&#39;ll be our chance to strike.&quot;

&quot;Copy, Aero leader,&quot; came four voices. Skye merely nodded. Soon they 
could all see the murky cloud ahead of them&#151;no cloud, though, but a 
swarm of flying enemies so thick and numerous that they only resembled a 
cloud. They blotted out a good portion of the distant sky, and if the 
reports were correct, this was only a skeleton force. Skye clenched her 
teeth and swooped further ahead, resigning herself to blood and battle 
and death, having nothing yet to regret upon.

&quot;Here they come!&quot; shouted Lady Wonder&#151;and the battle began 
instantaneously. About a dozen of the flying things came at them: 
cockatrices and griffons, evil birds of all makes and colors, even human 
beings with wings on their backs, perhaps the first wave of the undead. 
No time to think about that now&#151;G-Force barreled to the side and threw 
the nearest one for a loop. A swarm of insects rose up to smother the 
enemy, but four made it through the blockade and attacked the fliers 
head-on.

&quot;They&#39;re coming too fast!&quot; screamed G-Force. Skye and Lady Wonder looped 
around and converged, the former grabbing a sword from a fallen enemy. 
Lady Wonder shot energy blasts from her hands, scaring the enemy away 
but hardly hitting any. Below, Spoon Man took careful aim and launched 
his trademark weapons into the air, sometimes even hitting foes as they 
flew overhead. Phobia was powerless to do anything; she couldn&#39;t use her 
powers without getting a good look at her enemy. In the air, the three 
women whirled around like leaves, evading their enemies while struggling 
to fight back. One of the heroes who had flown in to help them was shot 
down.

&quot;We&#39;ve lost one!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll hold together!&quot; Lady Wonder was suddenly scorched; 
she cringed and clutched her abdomen. &quot;You hear me, old girl?&quot; she 
whispered. &quot;Hold together, just for awhile.&quot; More flying heroes were 
coming to their aid now, but to be fair, more of the enemies were making 
their way through Butterfly&#39;s defenses. G-Force thrust as many away as 
she could, and even though the hours of training she put into all this 
were paying off, she knew she wouldn&#39;t go on for very much longer. She 
floated down atop the nearest skyscraper, stood to regain her breath, 
and focused on those few that had followed her.

&quot;Let&#39;s get heavy,&quot; she muttered&#151;admittedly bad, but she couldn&#39;t think 
of anything else. A surge of gravity pulled down on the aerial foes, 
sending them plummeting towards the ground, until WHAM! G-Force winced 
as she noticed she had sent them into a garbage disposal. &quot;Better you 
than me, boys,&quot; she muttered playfully.

After taking a breather, the blue-skinned beauty leaped back into the 
fray to see what troubles she could get into. Skye was engaged with a 
large creature that looked like a sphinx, both of them clawing at each 
other like a couple of vultures fighting for carrion. Lady Wonder was 
out blasting some of the large airborne monsters, sending them scorching 
to the surface where the Spoon Man eagerly awaited their arrival. 
Butterfly&#39;s bug hoard was still in effect, but now they were only 
clouding and swarming briefly over the enemies, giving Lady Wonder and 
her allies time to fly over and finish them off. G-Force herself kicked 
one of them away just as they were about to attack the leader.

&quot;I gotta be more careful!&quot; exclaimed the old hero with a smile. 
&quot;Wouldn&#39;t want to be disposed of now in front of all these young 
people.&quot;

&quot;No, ma&#39;am!&quot; G-Force smiled, jerked around, and could honestly say that 
the time she spent fighting side-by-side with Lady Wonder was her finest 
hour.

......

Now that Technomancer had been &quot;reborn&quot; as a fully-fledged human woman, 
she could walk around independently, no longer affected by the imbalance 
caused by the lack of arms. She even exuded more confidence around other 
people, now that she had a decidedly prettier face and body. But the 
woman still seemed lame and blind, only because her beloved Venom was 
not by her side. There was no way a Tablet PC could substitute for the 
presence of a lover, though in her hands, it was a little more useful.

&quot;I&#39;d say that between the six of us, we&#39;ve got a good chance of scouting 
out their ringleaders,&quot; murmured Lady Luck. She glanced around at Team 
Surprise&#151;Paradox&#39;s own kitschy coinage&#151;and couldn&#39;t help but well up 
with pride. There was Disintegrator to tear apart the enemies, 
Technomancer to plan and coordinate their next moves, Guardian Angel to 
search for weak spots or areas of interest, Psyche just to all-around be 
a force of power, and herself, the Lady Luck, thrown in for good 
measure.

&quot;Or failing that, take out half the city,&quot; murmured Disintegrator. She 
shuddered as she mince-stepped through the darker corners of the steel 
jungle, clad in whatever could fit onto her new lean frame. There was no 
question she liked her new body, but it still felt awkward to walk 
around in it. She came to a stop, chewing on her lip as she meditated 
the mystery of an uncharted corner.

&quot;It&#39;s dark,&quot; whispered Psyche. She closed her eyes and focused&#151;then came 
to. &quot;There are enemies on the other side.&quot;

&quot;How many?&quot; Another moment...and she had it.

&quot;Twenty.&quot;

&quot;Not an issue for the likes of us,&quot; said Paradox, their strange leader. 
He looked at his charges and smiled oddly. &quot;We must stay hidden for as 
long as possible. Psyche, you and Disintegrator come with me. We&#39;ll leap 
out and surprise our foes. The rest of you must watch our backs. More 
than once, I&#39;ve been the victim of a surprise pincer attack.&quot; They 
agreed to his terms, and took to the shadows while he and the two girls 
jumped out, all of them blasting with their horrible psychic powers. 
Combined, the three of them swallowed an entire chunk of the city, 
taking out three skyscrapers in the blast&#151;and well over twelve enemies.

Just as Paradox predicted, a much larger force jumped in from behind, 
armed to the teeth. They didn&#39;t expect to be bombarded so suddenly; the 
Guardian Angel ran out first and struck hard, hitting each one at their 
weakest spot. Her versatile powers enabled her to see these spots; her 
martial arts training gave her the strength to exploit them. Neither 
Lady Luck nor Technomancer were warrior material, but when one can 
augment the fortune of those surrounding her, or&#151;say, increase one&#39;s 
strength via bionic enhancements&#151;one doesn&#39;t necessarily need to fight.

In the end, the skirmish caused more destruction than it prevented. 
These were just scattered bits of rabble, insignificant little worms 
that could cause little harm, and the first of many, many battles. 
Paradox and led his team further into the city, finding ways to sneak 
around, whittle the enemy forces down, and strike where they least 
expected it. His team would need all the force it could muster for the 
upcoming battles, but fortunately, both Luck and Surprise were on their 
side.

......

Team Power took another rest shortly after their second battle. So far, 
everything was going smoothly: Ronin was her usual daring self, Kailin 
was a firecracker, Rancor kept her rage under control as she plowed 
through the enemy, and Siren proved herself invaluable by utterly 
demolishing some of the undead that was scattered around. Up until she 
swung her sword, the zombies just kept on reviving and healing their 
wounds, or else grotesquely ignoring them, trudging onward to devour 
anything in their paths. But just a single stroke from Siren&#39;s 
spirit-based powers and they were gone for good! Of course, depending on 
the copper-skinned beauty meant giving her adequate breaks, and so, 
there they were.

BK Power felt lonesome. The only person she knew in the whole group was 
Siren, and she didn&#39;t want to distract the older girl with questions and 
socializing. Xiang was off with her boyfriend and Mora, and Sally was 
with the only genuine female member of the Savage Six (Shift did not 
necessarily count). Stricken with a sudden sense of curiosity, she 
walked up to Team Power&#39;s leader, wondering what other superheroes he 
had met in the wide world.

&quot;All shapes and sizes,&quot; came his dreamy reply. &quot;Some of them so very 
small, you could carry them in your hand. Others so immense, they could 
step over houses. I even met a few that had extra limbs, and powers so 
strange that mine seem normal in comparison.&quot;

&quot;Did you happen to see a woman resembling me, but fair-skinned?&quot; she 
asked him. Morpheus examined her and shrugged.

&quot;Young lady, in the mass and confusion of a large population of 
wildly-dressed characters, I couldn&#39;t possibly distinguish&#151;&quot;

&quot;Her name&#39;s Blue Mary,&quot; BK Power added, almost desperately. Now this got 
a reaction out of him; he stroked his beard.

&quot;Blue Mary, Blue Mary...hmm. Why yes, I did come across that name. In 
fact, I personally recruited her myself.&quot;

&quot;You did?! Really?!&quot; BK Power became aglow with fascination, and pleaded 
with Morpheus to introduce her. Meanwhile, Siren groaned and rolled her 
eyes.

&quot;Oh, here we go again&#151;the aficionada strikes. Don&#39;t tell her a thing, 
sir. She&#39;s absolutely enthralled over this Blue Mary person, and has 
been long before I became a Diva.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just jealous because Blue Mary is infinitely cooler than you 
could ever be,&quot; snapped BK Power. Siren grimaced and whirled around, 
ignoring the stubborn girl. BK Power then resumed, &quot;So could you please 
introduce me to her? Please! I&#39;m a huge fan; I&#39;ve always wanted to meet 
her in person!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll cross paths,&quot; Morpheus chuckled. &quot;It&#39;s not a small 
city. Keep your eyes peeled.&quot;

&quot;Yessir! Oh, thank you, sir! This will be a great honor!&quot; BK Power then 
hugged him, but even at her weakest level, she could crush the daylights 
out of the old man. It took the combined forces of Ronin and Rancor to 
pry her off. Once everyone felt like they had rested long enough, they 
resumed their sweep of the city, picking off evil forces wherever they 
were. Of course, now that she knew her idol was around here somewhere, 
BK Power was more focused with finding her than the enemy.

Like most veteran superheroes, Blue Mary was the kind who loved making 
an entrance. After being recruited by Morpheus, she positioned herself 
high atop one of the city&#39;s skyscrapers, keeping silent vigil on the 
world below. And when Morpheus&#39; team passed her line of vision, she 
watched to see what they were capable of, and continued watching, 
leaping from rooftop to rooftop in secret pursuit. She didn&#39;t want to 
reveal herself yet&#151;maybe during the next fight. She got her opportunity 
shortly; a large ambush had been set, and the entire Team Strong was 
surrounded by dozens of enemies. They could clearly hold their own, but 
surely they wouldn&#39;t mind the addition of another.

BK Power and the others looked up suddenly as a war-cry pierced the 
noise of battle. A woman was flying at them from above, getting mixed in 
the fray and holding her own against the superior numbers. Much like BK 
Power, she had a tight purple top that exposed her midriff, black loose 
fit pants, black fingerless gloves, and black boots. Her long brown hair 
was parted in the middle, and if dreams and nightmares could wage war, 
then certainly this woman was their physical embodiment. BK Power had no 
time to gush, though&#151;there were still enemies around them. But with Blue 
Mary&#39;s help, they wouldn&#39;t last long.

As the smoke settled, BK Power looked over to her savior, her idol, the 
woman she followed and loved deeper than anything she had loved before, 
and was so ecstatic she could barely squeal.

&quot;It&#39;s really you!&quot; she managed. &quot;It&#39;s you! You&#39;re Blue Mary!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s me,&quot; replied the older woman casually, reaching up to part 
her hair in that familiar fashion. BK Power could barely contain 
herself, but somehow managed to get closer and introduce herself.

&quot;Ohhhmyyygod, I am like so your biggest fan ever! I&#39;m 
like...unbelievably overjoyed! This is like a dream come true! I&#39;m 
actually talking to Blue Mary&#151;THE Blue Mary!&quot;

&quot;Please, don&#39;t make a fuss,&quot; said Blue Mary kindly. &quot;It&#39;s a pleasure to 
meet a fan. I didn&#39;t think people idolized me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, you&#39;re famous!&quot; BK Power insisted. &quot;You&#39;re the greatest 
superhero ever&#151;erm, I mean, in recent times, of course!&quot; Morpheus just 
smiled&#151;he knew what she meant&#151;and greeted the young woman with a wave. 
She bowed humbly, and asked BK Power just who she was.

&quot;Kristen Masterson,&quot; she said, taking Blue Mary&#39;s hand into her own. 
&quot;I&#39;m called BK Power when I&#39;m on the job. This is...such a great 
honor!!&quot;

&quot;Will you stop gushing already?&quot; groaned Siren. &quot;We all know you&#39;re in 
love with the poor woman, but you could at least contain yourself for a 
few hours!&quot; The others laughed, but poor BK Power was flushed red. Blue 
Mary didn&#39;t seem too fazed&#151;apparently she had dealt with fangirls 
before&#151;but Masterson was another story.

&quot;Shut up, Alyssa, just shut up. I am not in love with her; I&#39;m just her 
biggest fan, that&#39;s all.&quot; Siren snickered.

&quot;Right. And I&#39;m ten feet tall.&quot;

&quot;Shut UP,&quot; she growled through clenched teeth. Blue Mary winced in pain.

&quot;Um, Kristen? Could you let go of my hand please? You&#39;re sort of hurting 
me.&quot; Kristen jerked back in shock, and apologized so many times that 
even her patient idol started to look irritated. She politely excused 
herself to converse with Morpheus, leaving the humiliated younger woman 
to sulk. Siren wanted to egg her further, but she figured the young 
lovesick woman had been through enough already. Still, it was a mighty 
sickening scene when later, BK Power raised her hand up to her nose, 
inhaled the scent, and promised to never wash it from that day forth.

......

Team Stealth was full of lonely hearts. Lurker&#39;s vast knowledge of the 
underground tunnels gave her purpose as she voluntarily crept down into 
the darkness, using her enhanced senses to remain vigilant...or to 
track. The absence of BK Power was a little chilling: the timid yet 
strong woman had not only accepted Lurker for who she was, she loved 
every little trait and quirk that went along with it. Lurker had merely 
groaned quietly at her loneliness before, but now that she knew love&#151;or 
at least the first slivers of it&#151;the emptiness consumed her like no 
darkness ever could.

Sanaa took to the front, being the most experienced member of the team 
when it came to covert operations. With the exception of the team 
leader, who could look like anyone he (or she, or it) wanted to, nobody 
was better at sneaking around, being unnoticed, and striking out when 
the enemy least expected it. But Sanaa&#39;s heart wasn&#39;t into it; she 
missed Marissa, and everything about the younger pale girl. The two were 
not merely lovers, nor even soulmates; they were flesh-and-blood echoes 
of each other, closer than sisters and bound to each other since their 
conception. They had fought and even died together, and a bond that 
strong is not easily ignored, even in the middle of a war.

She had kissed her&#151;once. She had kissed her tenderly, taking her soft 
feminine hands with loving care, delivering a happy gaze of 
understanding, of love, and devotion. Aura had looked at Ferret in all 
her grotesque disfiguration and saw something beautiful. She had touched 
her lips tenderly, speaking into them with love: I am here, and I will 
not leave you. But why? She was so young, five years younger than 
Ferret. And so pretty, and sweet, and generous, and...everything a 
person could want. Sometimes Ferret wished she could turn into a ghost 
and stay that way forever. She was so unworthy.

&quot;Pay attention, friend,&quot; Snowblood warned her, grasping her wrist 
firmly. What an ironic thing for her to say; she couldn&#39;t even see. But 
here she was, leading the pack alongside Sanaa, with Stalker above and 
Ferret below. Bearing extrasensory perception made her blindness 
irrelevant; Snowblood saw what even hawks could not, and used that to 
warn the team of all dangers. She also had her metaphorical eyes on the 
feisty Rin, and despite her antisocial nature, had made several 
noticeable passes at the younger warrior. She was clearly more worried 
for her daughter than for Rin, but those that knew her well could see an 
edge of concern for Takamatsu in those dead, beautiful auburn eyes.

Finally there was Stalker, a person who had every reason to worry about 
her lover. Alicia Moore was in the care of Captain Amazing, probably the 
safest place she could be. Yet Stalker knew that no force in the world 
would be able to stop the mysterious man in white if he discovered 
Pale&#39;s whereabouts, perhaps not even Pale herself. She knew Alicia 
wouldn&#39;t give her alter ego away that easily, but considering how grave 
the whole situation was... Well, small wonder Stalker found it hard to 
concentrate.

&quot;You ladies don&#39;t look too good,&quot; Shift told them, wearing the guise of 
a young blond male. &quot;You worried about the battle?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think the members of this team are concerned about that,&quot; 
Snowblood told him. She&#39;d know; she could sense their anxiety. Sanaa 
backed her up.

&quot;We&#39;re just worried about our loved ones, sir&#151;every one of us. It&#39;s 
become apparent.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; He seemed apathetic for awhile and scratched his head. &quot;I&#39;ve never 
been in love, so I couldn&#39;t say. Of course, a creature like me could 
never find a lover anyway, but I hear it&#39;s not as cracked up as people 
make it out to be.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s cracked up all right,&quot; mused Sanaa, her voice too serious to 
be joking. Shift&#39;s lip curled in irritation.

&quot;If we&#39;re finished reminiscing, we should move on. It&#39;s our 
responsibility to find the leaders of this war and take them down. If 
you&#39;re all with me, come along.&quot; He walked steadily ahead, seemingly 
cold to the girls&#39; dilemmas. Ferret shook her head...but at least she 
had an elementary grasp of what was going through their leader&#39;s mind.

&quot;Just like me,&quot; she whispered softly. &quot;Caught between the boundaries, 
neither male nor female, but both at the same time. I feel your pain.&quot;

But...there&#39;s Aura, she reminded herself. That made her smile, a bit 
sadly, and agree. That was something at least.

......

Father Jacob Pochanski&#151;now a member of the Savage Six called Priest&#151;knew 
his job was going to be the most difficult. Forget about being rusty and 
unaccustomed to wandering around looking for trouble&#151;he was supposed to 
be in charge of the two most unreliable, unpredictable, and unlikable 
characters he had ever come across. The only reasons he asked for Yohko 
and Soma to join him was that one, he knew they didn&#39;t trust people with 
special powers and would thus be the best choice for a companion; and 
two, to keep them from doing any mischief. He did not trust either woman 
at all, not even with the task of guarding the MERCS headquarters, and 
thought it best that he watch over them.

&quot;You don&#39;t have anything to worry about on my part,&quot; Pandora the Gambler 
told him arrogantly. &quot;If I see a zombie, I&#39;ll blow them apart. If I see 
an enemy, I&#39;ll scorch them. If I see one of the &#39;good guys&#39; turn into a 
zombie, well...&quot; She gave him a feral grin and tapped her prosthetic 
eye. He couldn&#39;t help but shudder.

&quot;Yes, but the enemy to you might be a friend to me.&quot;

&quot;Relax,&quot; she drawled, &quot;I ain&#39;t gonna murder your precious superheroes. 
I&#39;ve got more important things to worry about. I may hate those freaks 
of nature, but...if it came down to gunning one of them or an undead 
monster, I&#39;d go for the zombie every time. They&#39;re even worse than the 
freaks. At least they don&#39;t eat your flesh, steal your soul, and send 
you plummeting into an eternal vortex of damnation. Freaks just ruin 
you.&quot;

&quot;What in the world caused you to be like that?&quot; he asked, his face 
ghastly. Pandora snorted.

&quot;If I told you, I&#39;d kill you after. Ask the doc; she&#39;s the only one I 
trust.&quot; Priest looked in Kamaguchi&#39;s direction, but she just smiled and 
waved her hands, not willing to reveal anything. Then he sighed.

&quot;My Battle Divas are good people. They have proven themselves time and 
again. I have spoken with some of the others, and none of them strike me 
as being evil. They are mostly...misguided.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s what they said about Anvil,&quot; stated Pandora deadpan. The effect 
was as planned: Priest looked like a brick of solid ice had punched 
right through his ribcage. He knew she was right, too; that&#39;s what made 
things worse.

&quot;You,&quot; he managed, &quot;know nothing about that abomination. Nothing at 
all.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t expect a priest to call a living being such a foul name,&quot; 
Kamaguchi teased. Priest turned and glared icily.

&quot;Even the Lord God Almighty has limits. And they were all crossed the 
minute Anvil came into being.&quot; Pandora let out a grunt-sigh, stretched 
her arms, and popped her knuckles.

&quot;Well, you know what they say. The bigger they are, the more powers I 
can restrain. Don&#39;t worry about a thing, chief. If this Anvil&#39;s half as 
bad as you say he is, I&#39;ll have him begging me to kill him before all 
this is over.&quot; Priest said nothing. He knew Pandora wouldn&#39;t listen 
anyway. He had heard several people say that same thing before, and 
every time they tried to prove it, the results were most...unpleasant.

&quot;We&#39;d better move on,&quot; he sighed, glad for a distraction. &quot;We need to 
evacuate as many people as we can before the real fighting starts. 
Yohko, I pray to God that you&#39;ve got battle experience.&quot;

&quot;Just enough,&quot; she replied coyly.

......

Captain Amazing and his team (given the uninspiring name of Team 
Amazing) had seen the most action so far: at least five waves of enemy 
forces, most of them low-level thugs that came running when their 
masters gathered on this battlefield. Everyone proved themselves in one 
way or another: Cobra and Venom double-teamed foes, smothering and 
restraining them with their respective lethal hugs; Bubblegum Black 
spewed pink gooey fluids on her foes, swinging them around or else 
leaving them hanging by lampposts; Thunder-Claw&#39;s methods proved most 
electrifying, and Captain Amazing was just plain himself.

Alicia Moore was the only one not participating. She was always on the 
sidelines, ready for a med kit or emergency rations should the team need 
it. Since nobody knew to what extent Thirteen would help them, it was 
better to not risk revealing Pale unless the situation was dire. Alicia 
accepted her more humble role&#151;not that she could do anything about 
it&#151;and was happy to be of help, even a little. After each fight, the 
team calmed down and took breathers, bracing themselves for when the dam 
broke and the streets would flood with evil.

&quot;Not going to be long now,&quot; said their amazing leader, drinking from a 
water bottle. &quot;Pretty soon, I&#39;d imagine, they&#39;ll stop fooling around and 
start acting seriously. They&#39;ll probably send in some big-time names 
from across the world, people you or I have never heard of. They may 
even use zombified heroes in the war.&quot;

&quot;Could we stop something like that?&quot; asked a horrified Black. Amazing 
smiled sadly.

&quot;If a hero is overwhelmed by those evil forces, all we can do is destroy 
them. Once bitten by the fangs of the dead, you too shall become one of 
them. It&#39;s the quickest way for our enemies to end this war, so we must 
destroy all the walking corpses before that happens.&quot;

&quot;So...if one of us is... Then that means...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so, young lady,&quot; he said gently. Black looked like she was 
about to cry. What if one of her friends got bitten? Or Steve? Or even 
herself? She took several deep breaths and asked Alicia for a soda; she 
emptied it in record time, but didn&#39;t look any better.

&quot;The worst is yet to come,&quot; said Moore from out of nowhere. Her voice 
had lowered an octave, now sounding more like Pale than Alicia. &quot;I have 
seen it,&quot; she continued. &quot;A great black blanket, worse than all the 
world&#39;s sorrow and misery, as deep and painful as Chaos itself&#151;the spawn 
of Pandemonium. Even now it is here, waiting for the proper time to show 
itself. It is so patient...so dark and cold...&quot; She took a very deep 
breath, shivered suddenly, and winced in pain&#151;back to Alicia, maybe? 
Whether she had really transformed briefly to divulge some information, 
or she was in a sort of limbo state, nobody could figure. But what she 
said made everyone nervous.

&quot;Are you talking about Anvil?&quot; asked Captain Amazing. Alicia&#39;s eyes 
glittered in fear.

&quot;No,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Something worse. Much worse.&quot;

.........

Garnet wasn&#39;t really listening to Kissa or Malchior as they instructed 
him. He didn&#39;t pay attention to the great legion of evil warriors now 
under his command, nor the far greater numbers of villains that had 
gathered there for this new war. The only thing on his mind was 
revenge&#151;the death of Kristen Masterson, as gruesome and painful as 
possible. He now knew that she had been the one who killed his beloved 
Yan, and for that act of barbarism, he would crush her and watch her 
squirm around like a dissected maggot.

&quot;Tell me,&quot; he mumbled, his voice dead and mature, &quot;who has gathered here 
today? What allies do I have?&quot;

&quot;Marvelous ones, the likes of which this world has never seen!&quot; Kissa 
told him. She then went over the list&#151;a pointless ceremony. Garnet 
didn&#39;t care who these people were or even what they did, just so long as 
they could help him destroy that witch. Admittedly, several names popped 
up that made his lip twitch in sadistic glee, and one made even him 
perspire in fear.

Aside from Kissa, Malchior, and himself, there was Lord Vyle, Major 
Maniac, the Ripper, and Slimester. Also there that day was Biohazard, 
Dr. Killgore, Bonesteel, Laugh Riot, and the Hunter. Kissa had 
resurrected several powerful creatures from the past as well: ING, the 
merciless; Reaper, the psychotic girl who could manipulate her own 
bones; Longshot and Deadeye, master sharpshooters; Miltorkka, the 
malevolent; and perhaps the greatest of them all, the dreaded Anvil 
himself.

&quot;Not a bad group,&quot; he summarized. &quot;I thank you both for going through 
such trouble.&quot;

&quot;No need to thank us,&quot; gushed Kissa. &quot;At the mere chance of destroying 
those mean old Savage Six, most of these people begged to be 
included&#151;and as you know, the dead are without opinions, morals, or 
vices. They just obey.&quot;

&quot;We were fortunate to have Omega&#39;s cultists on our side,&quot; Malchior 
reminded her. &quot;His death, while...interesting, has given us a great 
boon. We eliminated a great threat and gained a great many willing 
allies in the process. But let us not forget our original goal, or our 
bargain.&quot;

&quot;How you do harp on that,&quot; Kissa moaned. &quot;I told you, it takes time to 
find the type of homunculus you speak of. You can wait for this 
Celene-whatever a bit longer, can&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he growled, not letting her dark powers or her advantage in years 
and experience overwhelm him. &quot;Now that I&#39;ve found Kali, my thirst for 
her sister increases every day. It&#39;s shameful enough that she&#39;s still 
out there with that blood-creature.&quot;

&quot;The Solaris kid,&quot; Kissa pointed out (Garnet was being ignored, but he 
didn&#39;t mind). &quot;Well, I am hurrying. Do be patient. Our hoards will scour 
the planet, then you&#39;ll have that much less people to sift through. It&#39;s 
just vengeance upon vengeance with you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She laughed out loud; 
Malchior shuddered and wished for the nth time that he had found a 
better partner. But nobody had mastery over the dead greater than Kissa, 
not even he himself, and so necessity made terrible bedfellows.

&quot;May I go now?&quot; Garnet said, most annoyed. Kissa sighed and dismissed 
him; Malchior wished him luck, clenching the younger man&#39;s hand. He did 
not love this child, but compared to Kissa and many others he had met, 
Garnet was closer to him than a brother. Malchior watched the young man 
and his army march out of their hidden base, felt wistful, and returned 
to brooding by himself in his studies. Soon, he swore to his lost love. 
Have patience, my beauty. We&#39;ll meet again soon.

......

No matter where they were or what they were engaged with, everyone saw 
it coming. It was like a living tsunami, limbs and faces and all sorts 
of odd appendages crawling out, a legion of evil swarming their way, so 
massive that anyone could see it. Facing down this onslaught, there was 
no doubt in their minds: the calm had passed, the skirmishes were over. 
This was the storm.

The collision was awful. Great confusion overwhelmed everyone as a 
gigantic free-for all took place throughout the entire city. Teams 
Surprise, Power, Stealth, Aero, Amazing, and Alpha&#151;Pochanski&#39;s team&#151;took 
the force, the heroes putting forth their every effort to keep the 
deluge from destroying the whole city. Disintegrator blasted foes left 
and right, hoping she could distinguish between friend and foe in this 
mess. She fell to the side after being brushed by a zombie, and with a 
growl, focused on the walking corpse and blew its rotting body to 
pieces.

Psyche jumped as high as her powers could take her, but the air was 
infested with evil as well. Hovering briefly, she pointed her palms out 
at the unstoppable force and summoned up all her willpower, wishing for 
these enemies to be banished. Her psychic waves, augmented from her time 
spent in Death, shot down scores of them like they were gnats, but more 
came to replace them, every one flocking and fluttering around her like 
mad birds around carrion. She projected a shield and fell quickly to the 
ground; a lumbering giant spotted her and swatted her from the sky. The 
minions surrounding its feet passed right by it and continued their 
assault upon anything in their path, leaving him free to smash.

The beast put his entire weight into a building and pushed, hoping to 
topple it to the ground and crush the heroes&#151;but another mighty behemoth 
stepped out and rammed into him, sending him plummeting. It was a hero, 
a gigantic muscular woman, grinning wildly. The two giants battled like 
ferocious bulls as their smaller comrades fought on and on. The Guardian 
Angel watched them in horror, then turned her sights to the onslaught.

&quot;There,&quot; she whispered, seeing an opening. With her increased speed, she 
made haste to a half-constructed building, its steel skeleton abandoned. 
She hopped inside the nearest crane and activated it, steering it into 
the fray. She paused just briefly to pick up a steel beam, and was soon 
armed. Angel guided the crane and her new deadly weapon, taking massive 
swings with it wherever she could. She even managed to hit the giant, 
distracting it just long enough for the giant woman to pick him up and 
throw him. She turned around and waved at the crane...and then rolled 
slowly out of the way as a ball of lightning soared past her.

&quot;Make way!&quot; shouted Thunder-Claw, shooting everything in sight. He had 
went all-out in the first five minutes of the battle, not that he or 
anyone else had a choice. These guys were everywhere!! His energy 
reserves were almost gone, but he wanted to cause as much damage as he 
could before he dried out. Not far away, he could spy several enemies 
ganging up on his friends, and rushed over to help; he was knocked over 
by a larger monster, something like a buffalo that walked on two legs. 
He couldn&#39;t move fast enough to avoid the creature&#39;s kicks, but he did 
spit out a last jolt of energy into its face before he was gored. With 
the creature disoriented, he ran for cover and went looking for a new 
energy source; the buffalo recovered and charged after him relentlessly.

The towering woman, known as Mighty Jo, had now teamed up with several 
of the smaller heroes. She stomped through enemy ranks like a walking 
mountain, squishing the enemies with every step, or else brushing them 
aside with improvised clubs (such as Angel&#39;s steel beam). The Spoon Man 
was with her, taking out foes with one of his larger steel weapons, 
swinging them around as he ran just to keep up. Sometimes Mighty Jo 
would reach out and save him from a deadly blow; other times he would 
run over and pick off small enemies that had crawled onto her back. 
Together, the two of them charged through the city, into its very heart.

With all the monsters swarming in the air, it was a wonder Team Aero 
could even see. G-Force had worn herself out twice during the attack so 
far; she flung many enemies to their deaths, but more came along to 
replace them. Some were even undead versions of the same creatures she 
annihilated. The young woman glided over to the nearest skyscraper to 
recharge, but was knocked out of the sky by the villain called Major 
Maniac. He could fly indefinitely; she couldn&#39;t, and the two wrestled in 
midair for a long time, trading blows like they were timeless enemies.

Skye and Lady Wonder were both overwhelmed, having at least a dozen 
enemies each to fight. The dragon-girl made sure that every blow was a 
lethal one: if anything came close, she grabbed for it and slashed at 
its throat (or whatever she guessed was a vital area). Sharpshooters 
from below started firing, and she was hit twice, once in both her 
wings. She screamed in pain and dove down, smashing one as she crashed 
on him and facing the other like a carnal monster. He reloaded. She 
tackled. Guess who made it out alive.

Phobia and Butterfly were both in G-Force&#39;s debt, so when they saw her 
wrestling Major Maniac, they both raced over to the scene of the battle. 
Butterfly quickly summoned an army of the largest, strongest flying 
insects she could find, and instructed them to help her blue-skinned 
friend. She then called two Emperor Kikai, flying insects so large and 
beautiful that she actually bowed down on the floor in humility before 
riding (Phobia took to the second). They flew up where the action was, 
and could see a weak G-Force floating away from Major Maniac, who was 
now covered with stinging, biting bugs.

&quot;Phobia!&quot; shouted Butterfly. The youngest member of the whole group 
nodded, chewed her lip for one hesitant second, and focused on the 
villain. She only needed to give him a brief nightmare, just long enough 
to stop him. He let out a single scream quickly&#151;the man must&#39;ve had 
great fears&#151;and was quickly overcome by the poisoned bugs. G-Force saw 
her chance and dove back in, ramming into Major Maniac with all her 
power. She forced him to shatter upon the ground, breaking every bone in 
his body. The death was meaningless to her; she turned right around and 
wailed on the nearest thug.

Siren was kept totally busy banishing zombies. Admittedly, without her 
help, the creatures would continue to come back and would soon overwhelm 
everything and everybody. Seeing as how they were not living beings, and 
she wielded spirit power, it was a logical choice to use: her sword cut 
down whole flanks of them, and when her arms tired, she ran by and 
scissor-kicked their heads off. She had the protection of Morpheus, 
whose sleep-inducing powers kept the living things off her back, and 
several other members of the Savage Six crowded around her and guided 
her deep into the thick of the battle, where her skills would be most 
effective.

BK Power and Blue Mary made an awesome team, and if Masterson hadn&#39;t 
been dark-skinned, they might have passed as twins. Admittedly, BK was 
stronger&#151;even at her weakest level, she could fling enemies everywhere, 
and at her highest, she could even topple the giants that littered the 
city&#151;but Blue Mary had experience, speed, and grace on her side. Plenty 
of zombies found themselves with holes punched in their chests, courtesy 
of Miss Masterson, or their heads blown off, courtesy of the Blue one.

Inferno knew her firepower could help get rid of the zombies, so she 
acted as a cleanser whenever Ronin sliced them apart. There was no point 
in hacking zombies to pieces, because they didn&#39;t need to be whole to be 
a threat, but it gave Inferno the extra time to turn the heat up. While 
she was occupied with the undead, a most enormous colossus, bigger even 
than Mighty Jo, stood before the two ronin and roared. Rin grinned.

&quot;Ten seconds,&quot; she uttered. Before the thing could react, she had jumped 
up and plunged her sword into its thigh&#151;one. A quick shimmy up its bare 
back&#151;two&#151;grabbing loose bits of flab and fat along the way (maybe a 
slice here or two to irritate the thing)&#151;three, four&#151;and she made it 
slowly to its shoulder, weaving wildly as its arms tried swatting her 
away&#151;five, six. She raised her indestructible katana and rammed it right 
into the base of the monster&#39;s neck&#151;seven&#151;and for good measure, stabbed 
it two more times, until she cut the spinal chord. The monster 
shuddered&#151;eight&#151;and fell&#151;nine&#151;Ronin hanging on until it crashed dead to 
the ground&#151;ten.

&quot;Waste of time,&quot; she said victoriously.

......

Team Alpha hurried behind a large slab of concrete, just in time to 
avoid the blast of toxic slime from their enemy&#39;s direction. 
Slimester&#151;why did it have to be the Slimester? Even Pandora looked sick 
as the filthy sludge corroded the slab and melted it, but there was no 
time to vomit. Priest darted out of hiding to return fire; the Slimester 
shot back, spraying sickly purple ooze everywhere. Priest hid behind the 
deteriorating slab, reloaded his gun, and ran back out to continue the 
crossfire.

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d like to steal his powers,&quot; Yohko said to Pandora. 
The Gambler gave her a look as deadly as the slime surrounding them, and 
she paled. &quot;Fine, just an idea. I&#39;ll call Technomancer and see if she 
has any ideas.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re relying on them?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; said Kamaguchi evenly&#151;&quot;Unless you want to fight. I&#39;m not a 
warrior, Soma.&quot; Pandora sighed, but allowed the good doctor to do as she 
pleased. Priest briefly returned, barking that they should move to 
another spot before this one was destroyed completely, and the call was 
postponed. Meanwhile, Technomancer was having problems of her own. Too 
many enemies were interfering with Team Surprise&#39;s radios, and she 
couldn&#39;t transmit anything in secret. She beckoned Paradox over to help, 
but the baffling man was busy with his own affairs.

&quot;Just a few seconds!&quot; she begged. Paradox turned around, aimed his palm 
at her, and briefly encompassed her in some kind of shield that allowed 
her to have brief, albeit total, communications access. She put out new 
orders to her teammates just as she got several incoming calls from 
people asking for her expertise. The one that surprised her the most was 
Team Alpha&#151;the one with the bigots.

&quot;Sorry Priest,&quot; she muttered as she ignored the plea. &quot;I&#39;m not helping 
you if it means I&#39;m assisting those two bitches. You&#39;ll have to figure 
this out on your own.&quot; She went to the next call, a distress signal from 
Venom. Her new, real, flesh-and-blood heart humped up in her chest as 
she returned the call, hoping her advice helped the lovely young woman 
she cared for.

Venom, Cobra, and Bubblegum Black were caught fighting Biohazard, a 
creature trapped in a radiation suit who could emit toxic chemicals, 
much like the Slimester. Venom found her powers useless against him, and 
he corroded everything Beeg sent his way. Alicia couldn&#39;t fight, and 
Thunder-Claw was still recharging, so they were stuck for the moment. It 
was Cobra who was doing the most fighting; she and Biohazard canceled 
each other out.

&quot;Cobra!&quot; Alicia shouted suddenly. She had been given responsibility over 
monitoring transmissions, and now she had one. &quot;TM asks for you to apply 
a superheated substance to Biohazard! She suggests using the same thing 
that helped slow down the Golem.&quot; Cobra knew what that meant&#151;boiling 
water, in other words&#151;and shouted for Bubblegum Black to whip her 
elastic goo out and break open a fire hydrant. Black had her pink sludge 
out and lashing in no time; the spray of the water sent her shrieking 
back. Now to heat it.

&quot;Allow me!&quot; shouted Captain Amazing. He flew over, held his hand over 
the spouting water, and used his powers to saturate it with intense 
heat. The water splashed on Biohazard, acting as a cleansing solution to 
erase his radiated nature: now the others could close in and destroy 
him. Cobra was first, followed by Bubblegum Black, who wrapped him in 
her sticky sludge to hold him down while Cobra jumped up, wrapped her 
strong arms around his neck, and twisted.

Meanwhile, Priest just came up with the very same idea on his own, but 
there were no hydrants around. Yohko volunteered to scan for one since 
she really had no other purpose, leaving the other two to play tag with 
the Slimester. They could shoot at the purple blob all they wanted; 
gunfire just annoyed him and passed right through his gelatinous body. 
Yohko finally found a water source, but cursed her luck: it was too far 
away.

&quot;Then let&#39;s see if he melts,&quot; said Pandora with an evil smile. She shook 
her head, twirling the implanted 8-ball around, and waited for her wheel 
of fortune to come up on Flame-thrower (now, thought Priest, if only 
Lady Luck were here!). The Gambler&#39;s wager paid off, and the dial landed 
exactly where she wanted. With Priest covering her, she leaped out from 
her cover and sprayed the Slimester with searing winds of fire. The 
creature screamed in agony for just a moment before his body evaporated, 
and whatever was left was quickly burned or buried.

&quot;One down,&quot; sighed Pandora, &quot;a gazillion to go.&quot;

......

Rancor had teamed up with a cute red-skinned woman called Mega-girl, and 
together the two acted like bulldozers, ramming and thrashing anything 
in their paths. The older, taller woman was free to let her rage swallow 
her up, but this was a righteous fury that took control of her. Not only 
did her body solidify like a tank, but long sharp spikes and razors 
protruded out, her highest level of defense. Rancor knew it was hard to 
start moving in that state, but once she started, it was equally 
difficult to stop.

&quot;Move out of the way!&quot; shouted Mega-girl, using her own powers to knock 
away any stray foes. She and Rancor plowed through everything in their 
path, including several buildings that were not necessarily abandoned. 
They mowed down scores of zombies, flattening them back into their 
graves, and must&#39;ve killed plenty of dregs along the way. But they had 
to stop soon; Rancor accidentally crashed into one of the villains, and 
this one didn&#39;t like having angry little girls hit him.

&quot;What the hell?&quot; she muttered, reverting back to a less defensive state. 
She gazed up and saw the scruffy man&#151;Bonesteel, if she remembered 
correctly. Oh yes, the man who could not be cut. She had made an 
impressive ding in his armor, but nothing&#151;nothing&shy;&#151;could mow him down, 
not even a fully-powered charging Rancor. He picked up the tall woman 
and leered at her; Mega-girl game to the rescue, but her attempts were 
futile.

Let her go, came a husky, whispering voice. Bonesteel looked over and 
snarled...but nothing was there. He growled and returned to taunting the 
girls, but once again, the voice came: You were warned. Almost 
immediately, Bonesteel was smothered by what looked like a living 
shadow, one so quick and blurry that it frightened the other girls. They 
looked away as the shadow covered his body, forced itself into his 
mouth, and destroyed him from within.

You can look now, came the voice several moments later, most likely the 
shadow&#39;s. The girls did, but regretted it: Bonesteel looked like he had 
been turned inside out. Rancor groaned.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna puke.&quot;

Do what you must, but return to the battle, the shadow advised them. It 
slinked off...

&quot;Wait! What the bloody hell are you?&quot;

&quot;Wraith&quot;, it said to them. They shivered and watched it vanish into the 
other shadows. Rancor blew out a breath of amazement.

&quot;Whoever that was, he and Stalker would get along great.&quot;

The Stalker was too busy focusing on the army surrounding her and Sanaa 
to worry about other shadows. The two stood back-to-back, facing off 
against an endless ring of creatures that no description could provide. 
They had slaughtered so many dozens to get to this point, Stalker 
swinging with two obsidian swords and Sanaa unloading everything her 
guns had to offer, and yet these monsters never seemed to decrease. And 
now they were surrounded, with no way out. As unlikely as the 
partnership seemed, they were now bonded through the fires of battle.

&quot;Take my hands,&quot; Stalker murmured, fishing for Sanaa&#39;s wrists. The two 
clung onto each other firmly, Sanaa placing her trust in the young girl. 
&quot;Whatever happens, just trust me. And keep your eyes closed.&quot;

&quot;You have a plan?&quot;

&quot;A really crazy one.&quot; Sanaa smiled.

&quot;Just my type.&quot; Stalker roared suddenly, and a sphere of total darkness 
covered the two of them. They used the shadow&#39;s cover to actually slip 
underneath the surface&#151;she and Sanaa, protected by that black cloud&#151;and 
wheeled around until Stalker believed they were safe. Quickly they 
jumped back up to the surface&#151;no enemies around yet&#151;and ran for cover. 
The ring of evil that had surrounded them roared in fury, and pursued 
with hot bloody revenge. Sanaa heard them coming, and returned fire 
until her weapons were totally dry. The only other tools at her disposal 
were short-range weapons, so for the moment, retreat sounded pretty 
smart. They ran until they came in contact with their team leader, whom 
they recognized by Sanaa&#39;s heightened sense of smell.

&quot;You ladies been having a good time?&quot; asked the Shift.

&quot;Oh, you know us girls. Always looking for fun.&quot;

&quot;Then you&#39;re gonna love this,&quot; he said, sounding excited and scared all 
at once. They turned around and paled. Standing before them were four 
gigantic creatures, Cyclopes by the look of them. And coming in from 
behind were the enemies they had just ditched. The two unlikely allies 
took a breath, shook hands, and came out fighting.

......

Lady Luck and Ferret worked alongside a man called Sergeant Bizarro, and 
nothing else needed be said about him&#151;his name covered it all. Being 
that neither girl was much of a warrior, they stuck to helping out as 
many people as they could. Already they had assisted several heroes they 
had never met, and the three had even managed to fight back a small 
group of thugs terrorizing the citizenry of the town. Now they were 
looking for Stalker, who had called asking for their assistance.

&quot;If I know her,&quot; panted Ferret as the three of them ran through the 
city, &quot;and I don&#39;t, she&#39;ll already be out of trouble by the time we get 
there.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...and into another one!&quot; added Lady Luck. She skidded to a halt 
suddenly and let out a vicious scream: one of the heroes she recognized 
had been attacked by a zombie. The undead monster&#39;s head was latched 
onto her arm, and as hard as she shook it, it wouldn&#39;t pry off. The 
damage was tragically done: the girl&#39;s body was already decaying, and 
soon she would be like the walking dead. She spotted the trio and 
shouted at them with horrified eyes.

&quot;HELP ME!!!!&quot; Sergeant Bizarro dashed over, and with a single chop, cut 
the woman&#39;s arm clean off. The cry she let out was unbearable, but 
better to lose one&#39;s arm than one&#39;s soul.

&quot;Forgive me,&quot; he said, checking her for further infection. A piece of 
her face suddenly crumbled off and fell to the floor; Lady Luck and 
Ferret clung to each other as they looked away. The woman trembled, 
knowing she was doomed.

&quot;I don&#39;t feel it,&quot; she said, indicating her severed limb. &quot;I don&#39;t feel 
it at all. Please, kill me before I become like them.&quot; Sergeant Bizarro 
raised his sword again, and pointed it at her chest.

&quot;What is your name?&quot; he asked. The girl let out a hiccup.

&quot;Daisy. Daisy Chain. I had control over certain plants.&quot;

&quot;Daisy Chain,&quot; he addressed her, &quot;I swear on my life that you will be 
avenged. Forgive me.&quot; She squeezed her eyes shut as he impaled her, and 
fell to the floor, dead&#151;hopefully. He took a breath and blew fire on 
Daisy Chain&#39;s body, quickly burning it to ashes before the decay of 
living death could spread. It was a horrible scene, but except for a few 
grisly moments, Ferret and Lady Luck did not witness it. Instead, they 
held each other.

&quot;Don&#39;t look, Aura,&quot; begged the androgynous one. &quot;Don&#39;t look at it. Just 
concentrate on me, please. Look at me.&quot;

&quot;I...I am,&quot; she promised. And blushed. Ferret had such...pretty eyes... 
And now Ferret blushed. Oh dear. They were quite close together. She 
leaned in to kiss the girl she loved...

&quot;You two,&quot; came the Sergeant&#39;s voice suddenly, stirring them from their 
intimacy, &quot;come along. The horrors of this war are just beginning. I 
only pray we don&#39;t have to kill any more good souls.&quot; He walked away, 
half-disgusted and half-mournful, leaving Lady Luck and Ferret behind. 
They jogged to catch up, not realizing until much later that they were 
still holding hands.

......

Lurker took to the buildings, scaling them like a lizard. She scurried 
on all fours, her claws acting as the perfect grappling tools, and 
leaped off whenever she saw an enemy fly by. Two mighty slashes and the 
thing was killed; she then leaped off onto the next building and hunted 
for the next one. Another giant was in her way, so she jumped off and 
clung onto his back. The beast tried reaching back to scratch his itch, 
but his arms were too short and Lurker was too quick. She tore terrible 
gashes in his spine as she rappelled down, caught the end of his 
oversized shirt, swung around, and planted herself on its chest. Two 
more swipes and she let go, scurrying so as to not be flattened. She 
didn&#39;t think her venom would work on a beast that size, but no harm in 
trying.

Suddenly, something grabbed her and pulled her&#151;far. Lurker twisted out 
of the grasp, but a second hand shot out and took hold of her. Their 
grip felt as strong as concrete, and try though she might, she could not 
escape. As she was drawn closer to her captor, she could see the 
outlines of the person: it was a girl, not much older than she, but she 
didn&#39;t look or smell human. As a matter of fact, she was undead. Her 
name was the Reaper.

&quot;Kill me,&quot; whispered the girl, drawing Lurker closer. &quot;Kill me, please. 
Kill me, kill me, kill me. Put me out of my misery.&quot; Lurker squirmed, 
feeling like a fish caught in a hook&#151;the long, extending arms of the 
Reaper were crushing her the closer they came to the body of the undead 
girl. &quot;Kill me&#151;&quot; Lurker&#39;s green face turned pale, and she found it hard 
to breathe.

&quot;Let go!&quot; she yelled, fighting for her life. Now she was close enough to 
see the Reaper clearly. Her body was totally disfigured, and looked like 
it had been severely burned and crushed. Her arms snapped and groaned as 
the bones shrank, bringing Lurker closer and closer to her doom. 
&quot;Release! I...dying! I not breathe! Let go, I beg you!&quot;

&quot;Kill me,&quot; murmured the Reaper coldly&#151;&quot;I beg you.&quot; Lurker let out a yell 
as she was completely embraced by the strong arms. She was now pressed 
up against the rotting body of the girl, a deadly hug of intimacy. 
Lurker opened her mouth to groan...and was silent. A tear came out of 
the Reaper&#39;s opaque eye.

&quot;Madness overcame me while I was alive,&quot; she said, her voice empty and 
grave. &quot;I was out of control. For all my life, everyone hated me. I was 
cast into shadows. I drank blood from animals to survive. I was so 
lonely and wretched. I lost my mind, and in turn, killed many innocent 
people. No...not innocent. They hated me. But now we&#39;re all dead. Dead, 
dead, all dead. It&#39;s so cold. Please, kill me.&quot; Lurker struggled just to 
breathe.

&quot;Yes. Yes. Will...end pain. But...let go.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said the Reaper. &quot;I want to know what love is like. I have chosen 
you because you are a monster like me. I want to know what love is like 
from somebody who will not hate me.&quot; Now the Lurker turned pale for a 
completely different reason. She knew that feeling, only too well. She 
sighed, but still struggled to be free.

&quot;I...know what love is,&quot; she whispered weakly. &quot;I...love...Krissy 
Masterson. Pretty Beekay, most wonderful soul. She different, like me. 
We all...cast out. What must I do?&quot;

&quot;Come,&quot; said Reaper, drawing Lurker close. She placed cold lips on 
Lurker&#39;s mouth, and gave her the icy kiss of the dead. Lurker felt 
faint&#151;her reddish eyes saw black spots before them&#151;and the icy touch of 
a gentle hand felt around her shaggy white hair. Reaper moaned. The hand 
twitched...

No, Julie said to herself. She going to kill me!! The hand now turned 
its fingers into a spear, the bones extending&#151;but that left Lurker a 
chance to break free. In a single motion, fueled by her every fiber of 
will and desire, she thrust herself into Lurker and slashed right 
through, shredding the body into pieces. Limbs, dead organs, even the 
stretched bones fell to the floor, some of the muck splattering on 
Lurker&#39;s clothes. She shuddered and picked them off...and turned around.

The Reaper&#39;s decapitated head had a smile.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she whispered. Lurker groaned in pain, reached for a loose 
slab from one of the collapsed buildings, and with all her strength, 
smashed it on the grinning girl. And wept.

Snowblood had fought well, but now she was split up from her team. Siren 
had gone off to exterminate zombies, BK Power was with her idol, and 
Rancor was acting like a demolitions expert, as always. That left her 
with Ronin and Inferno, the only people she truly considered 
sisters-in-arms, so being with them wasn&#39;t bad. The three of them held 
their own very well, but even combined, they couldn&#39;t kill everything in 
sight. As more flesh-and-blood enemies were wiped out, more and more 
zombies replaced them, perhaps the master plan of the necromancers. Even 
some of the heroes were dying, or worse, being transformed into the 
walking dead.

&quot;At this rate, we&#39;ll all be finished before sunset,&quot; murmured Snowblood 
to herself. Her senses tingled...thwee...chop! Another gone. Another 
murmur...pitta-pitta-pitta&#151;she darted out of the way as needles rained 
down from above. She swung, felt resistance, knew she had hit 
something...and then Rin&#39;s voice cried out to her.

&quot;SETSIE!!&quot; She could feel the powerful Ronin pushing her out of the way, 
just in time to avoid the blast of plasma energy. She hadn&#39;t sensed 
that!! Ronin barked out a gruesome challenge, and ran out to kill the 
one who had tried to vaporize Snowblood. Setsuka did not need eyes to 
figure out what happened to him. She got to her feet, managed to 
breathe...and quickly braced herself to whirl around and strike the foe 
behind her.

&quot;I&#39;m not out of the fight yet, fools,&quot; she addressed the unseen thing. 
She raised her skinny sword and stabbed the Whatever twice in 
succession. Whew. Her senses seemed at peace now, and then there was 
Ronin, coming back for her.

&quot;You okay, Setsie?&quot;

&quot;I am fine, my friend,&quot; Snowblood said, managing a smile.

&quot;Well, good. I&#39;d hate to lose you. Kohona will kill me if her mommy gets 
hurt.&quot;

&quot;Yes, and I&#39;ll be in the same predicament if you suffer injury. I thank 
you.&quot; She bowed, and even from that distance, she could feel Rin&#39;s 
flustered aura.

&quot;H-hey, don&#39;t do that. I just...&quot;

&quot;You saved my life,&quot; Snowblood said. She took a step over, but collapsed 
all of a sudden. Then she remembered, that one attack about three hours 
earlier. Yes, yes, she had been hit in the leg&#151;no, not just the leg, but 
everywhere. She was wounded and bleeding all over, and if her nasal 
capacity had anything to it, Rin was just as messed-up. But she was 
standing; Setsuka wasn&#39;t. In fact, she was on the floor. She had fallen.

&quot;Setsie! Damn it, woman, don&#39;t you freaking die on me!!&quot;

Setsuka Hinomoto didn&#39;t hear anything for the next five hours.

Until, that is, she woke up.

&quot;About time,&quot; came the unmistakable sound of a worried Rin. &quot;I should 
have known better. Setsie the great would never die from a flesh wound, 
not even if she had a hundred. But you sure did pass out. It&#39;s been five 
hours, and it&#39;s gotten dark. A lot of people are still in the battle, 
but there are some who are resting. Kailin and Angel are down here 
somewhere too.&quot;

&quot;And where am I?&quot; she murmured. Rin sighed.

&quot;I carried you underground somewhere. I think this place used to be an 
office, several decades ago. This place seemed the cleanest, so I took 
you here. Better here than the surface, anyway.&quot; Setsuka sighed deeply, 
moaned, and turned so she could at least face Rin&#39;s general direction.

&quot;I thank you again, friend. Now I am in even deeper debt.&quot;

&quot;Hey, relax!&quot; laughed the Ronin. &quot;Good friends and rivals carry no 
debts! You just relax, and good ol&#39; Rin&#39;ll take care of you. On the 
honor of my family and my sword, you shall not be harmed!&quot; She stood 
straight and saluted; Setsuka chuckled.

&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re noble,&quot; she mused. Rin flustered.

&quot;D-don&#39;t say that, jeez. Just shut up and go to sleep.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;ve been sleeping for five hours. I need to stand.&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t get&#151;&quot; Too late; Setsuka was already standing, though her head 
swam because of it. She let out a sick moan and collapsed right into 
Rin&#39;s grasp...and smiled with contentment. She embraced the younger 
woman, feeling so safe and secure...

&quot;Rin,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I don&#39;t know how I can express everything I feel. 
Regret, at being forced to be your enemy... Admiration and respect, for 
your warrior&#39;s creed... Fear, that you should leave me and my daughter; 
hope, that we might share a life together once this is all finished... 
But I think the strongest thing I feel right now is love.&quot;

&quot;Say...what?&quot; whispered the Ronin, feeling slightly queasy. Snowblood 
sighed.

&quot;I can no longer keep it to myself. This battle has proven that I should 
never save my feelings for later, because...when later comes, we might 
not be there to hear it. So I will say this without regret, with all the 
honesty and truth I have.&quot; And now, Setsuka looked dead into Rin&#39;s eyes, 
bold and calm. Rin&#39;s mouth opened.

I love you, Rin.

And closed, as Setsuka kissed her deeply. She stood paralyzed, not 
knowing how to react. Nobody had ever...loved her before. Not in this 
way, at least. These were uncharted waters, and they scared her&#151;and it 
was Snowblood, her rival, the only person who had ever challenged her in 
every aspect. Of course, this fact was not lost on Rin: Setsuka Hinomoto 
was, by all means, her perfect match. But she didn&#39;t know whether to 
draw the other woman in or push her away, so she stayed still. &quot;Setsie&quot; 
just smiled as she released Rin&#39;s lips.

&quot;You&#39;re so chapped and rough,&quot; she whispered&#151;&quot;but delicate and beautiful 
in your own way. Rin, what is the matter? Do you honestly not feel the 
same way?&quot;

&quot;...I don&#39;t know what to feel,&quot; she managed, squeaking loosely. She 
started to falter, her identity and soul crumbling, reshaping, 
reforming, disintegrating. &quot;I don&#39;t know what, Setsie. I...kinda 
figured...you had a thing for me for a long time, but...nobody&#39;s ever 
loved me. I don&#39;t know how to react. This is so new to me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; whispered the blind woman, caressing Rin&#39;s face softly. &quot;We 
can take our time. I just wanted you to know that I love you, Rin. With 
all of my heart, I love you, and I delight in saying it.&quot; Rin felt 
herself being kissed again&#151;on her cheek, her jaw, her nose, and her 
lips, and she giggled just a little from the tickly, tense feeling. How 
come Setsie knew where to touch her, where she was most sensitive? 
...Oh, that&#39;s right; she was psychic.

The perfect match indeed. Slowly, this whole love deal was starting to 
make sense.

&quot;Oh, Setsie,&quot; sighed Rin, &quot;thank you for being so patient with me...&quot;

&quot;Anytime,&quot; said the woman, grinning cutely&#151;&quot;my love.&quot;

When their passionate midnight tryst finally concluded, Setsuka felt so 
exhausted from everything that had happened&#151;her service to Sashuo, 
losing and finding her daughter, fighting and befriending Rin, this war, 
and now their shaky romance&#151;that she simply drifted off and collapsed 
into sleep. Rin felt her new lover&#39;s body go numb, and put her naked 
arms around her soft back in an effort to keep her warm. She thought 
long and hard about everything before she joined her unusual lover in 
merciful rest&#151;thoughts that would serve to wake her up the next day.

Everyone had been through a lot already, but Rin knew that their true 
crucible was just beginning. The next day already loomed over them, dark 
and dominating, the promise of victory and doom wrapped safely in its 
deadly hands.

.........

&quot;Here&#39;s what we have so far,&quot; said the leader of Team Amazing, pointing 
to a schematic. &quot;After exchanging information with the other five teams, 
I&#39;ve written a composite of what we&#39;ve done, who we&#39;ve lost, and what we 
could do in the future. Already we&#39;ve seen the destruction of Major 
Maniac, Biohazard, Slimester, Bonesteel, and the Reaper, plus about six 
legions&#39; worth of the more standard enemy. On the other hand, fourteen 
members from our side were lost, six to the zombies. We have scouts 
searching for these six, so hopefully we&#39;ll be able to put them out of 
their misery.&quot; He paused to clear his throat, then turned the page.

&quot;Information from Team Stealth suggests a man named Garnet is leading 
this part of the attack. I&#39;ve asked Shift to send his crew after this 
person, and we should be getting updates on the hour. Since there&#39;s no 
information regarding the necromancers mentioned, we can&#39;t make certain 
of their plans until they show up. If we accomplish nothing else today, 
let us take down at least one of their leaders.&quot; His team all agreed in 
unison, and piled their hands together, one atop the other. Everyone was 
still worn out&#151;a few heroes had fought all night straight&#151;and were 
starved, since the last time they had eaten anything was a day ago. 
Captain Amazing provided ration bars, but they just didn&#39;t do the trick.

&quot;All the more reason for us to get this over with,&quot; said Thunder-Claw 
grimly. He looked over at his girlfriend, squeezed her hand, and 
breathed deeply, trying to calm his nerves. Worrying made him physically 
sick, so he needed to be in top condition for the second day of the 
mighty struggle. After their quick breakfast, the team emerged from 
their shelter, back out into the battle zone. Most of the city was still 
aglow with fires, blood, and destruction; the fighting had gone on all 
night, with few people getting any rest. It was the undead who caused 
them trouble: they could walk and fight forever and never tire.

But now the heroes had a new enemy to face. Up until now, they had the 
undead army, what seemed like every supervillain in the country at their 
elbow, plus the addition of low-level thugs, droogs, lackeys, minions, 
cronies, underlings, hooligans, and creeps everywhere. But now the Cult 
of the Seven Deadly sins, that army of berserk sheep set out to avenge 
their shepherd, had reached the border of the city, and were poised to 
overrun it. The battle yesterday, while violent, had more or less went 
smoothly, but with the additional numbers, things looked even more grim 
than before. And so, when all the forces converged&#151;good and evil, mixed 
with a few who could pass as both or neither&#151;the second gigantic 
free-for-all took place.

The two forces collided as they had the other day...but two 
warrior-women who had taken the front lines actually seemed to be 
holding them back! Several veteran heroes recognized them as the Twin 
Towers, two women so identical in shape, size, and style that one might 
think they were clones. They were in fact the twin sisters Suzikara 
&quot;Kara&quot; and Tarahito &quot;Tara&quot; Tsukata, masters of the naginata, feared by 
the dark and loved by those fighting for good.

Alongside them was a man called Law; naturally, aiding him, a blinded 
woman named Justice. Both these worthy allies held enormous power and 
combined them to not only hold off the tidal wave of enemies, but 
actually succeeded in pushing them back! Law&#39;s large hands could stretch 
and twist at will, throwing and striking foes from even the greatest 
distance; Justice&#39;s scales acted like a terrible morning star, smashing 
bones and bodies wherever they were tossed. After debilitating one of 
the leftover Cyclopes from the other day, the two heroes smiled at each 
other and dared for more enemies to challenge them.

Also fighting on the front was Wraith, the shadow-creature who had 
destroyed Bonesteel; it was smothering its foes with its own supple 
body, slinking into their mouths to blow them apart from within. Having 
no shape or form of its own, Wraith only feared the light, and wedged 
itself right in the very center of the great battle, slipping in and out 
of enemies like a poltergeist. With him was Mega-girl, one of the people 
it had saved during its dark crusade; she was battering foes as well, 
taking the full might of the attack.

The gigantic woman Mighty Jo stood just behind her smaller allies. It 
was her responsibility to stomp on anything that got past the barricade 
of heroes, and from the huge grin on her face, she was enjoying her job 
immensely. She also swatted at the flying creatures around her, and 
sometimes dipped her immense paws into the fight to pluck out 
mischievous villains. A single crush and they were jelly. Of course, 
even she could not fight an enemy if it got behind her, so there were 
plenty of other heroes there, including the aptly-named Sergeant 
Bizarro.

The Savage Six had positioned their teams at key points, but except for 
a few general pointers, had thrown strategy out the window. In a fight 
that huge, one&#39;s skill and strength mattered more than a clever mind, 
and it took all their strength and skill just to beat back the enemies. 
Captain Amazing was sweating buckets of water as he swung and blasted; 
Paradox buckled under his own might as he flung enemies all around; 
Morpheus looked ready to collapse as he sent more villains into 
Slumberland; Lady Wonder and her aerial team shot enemies down from the 
sky; Priest and his two cohorts squeezed through the fight to back up 
Shift&#39;s team as they went in pursuit of Garnet.

&quot;This is insane!&quot; shouted BK Power, toppling yet another gigantic 
monster. Apparently Mighty Jo was not the only person who could grow 
large; there had been at least twenty giants at the beginning, and 
fifteen more seemed to have joined (not including the super-giant Ronin 
took down). Her idol Blue Mary fought at her side, a smirk of enjoyment 
on her mouth as she tossed, smashed, pummeled, and blew away her 
enemies.

&quot;I would not have it any other way!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not used to so many!&quot; cried Power, wrestling with a 
crocodile-creature. She pried its mouth open and broke its jaw, then 
flung it away only to be tackled by an elephant-man. She and the 
enormous beast seemed evenly-matched, and squirmed around across the 
battlefield while everyone else fought tooth and nail. The Twin Towers, 
effortlessly cleaving through scores of Cultists, turned their focus 
onto a flying monster, one so wretched and evil that even the midnight 
sky was not dark enough to conceal him.

&quot;Miltorkka,&quot; they whispered in unison. The Malignant Miltorkka, for whom 
no curse is strong enough, sailed over the battlefield on a great black 
cloud, throwing thunderbolts where he may. The twins looked at each 
other, nodded, and prepared their assault. In perfect unison, they 
leaped onto the closest giant, scaled his large body without a problem, 
and leaped off his head with all their might. Both women landed atop the 
cloud; Miltorkka roared at his new guests.

Tara circled around him while Kara lunged forth, slashing ferociously. 
Even in life, Miltorkka had the skin of a rock, and it would take even 
more than their efforts to destroy him now that he was undead&#151;but the 
twins had a plan. With his body briefly open from the wound, Miltorkka 
roared and attacked Kara, swiping furiously with a hand engulfed in 
fire. She leaped away and signaled to her sister; Tara came bounding out 
and chopped at his arm with all her might. She missed, rolled to avoid 
the next attack, and waited for her sister to run in and stab him. 
Suzikara Tsukata did not miss.

The twins continued to flit around the vile creature, too fast and 
unpredictable for him to fight back. On the surface, Law and Justice saw 
their comrades battle the infamous villain and wished to help, but were 
tied down fighting the once-dead sharpshooters, Longshot and Deadeye. 
The artillery from these two was stunning; how they ever managed to die 
was beyond the hero&#39;s thoughts. Law twisted as well as he could, but 
there was no way to get in close without being grazed. He had his 
shield, but he didn&#39;t want to use it just yet...

Justice, meanwhile, had her scales out and was flinging them at Deadeye. 
They hit him in the head every time, but he didn&#39;t stop shooting. Three 
bullets went into Justice&#39;s body while she was up close, and a fourth 
grazed her foot. She didn&#39;t give him the pleasure of screaming; the 
woman just rammed her heel into the man&#39;s throat, again and again, and 
swung her scales until he dropped his weapon. She called for her 
partner; he stretched his long arms and grabbed the undead man.

&quot;Rest in peace,&quot; he uttered as he plowed his fist right through the 
man&#39;s rotting head. He threw Deadeye right at his partner, but Longshot 
was too brainless to recognize the other man. He simply continued 
firing, pelting his flying friend mercilessly until the body blew apart. 
Then, a miracle&#151;click, click. Longshot stared blankly at his weapon, 
wondering why he wasn&#39;t firing. Justice took this time and rushed him, 
smashing his head so hard that it rolled right off. She tossed the body 
in the direction of a giant, who paused only for a moment as a pleasant 
squish came up from the havoc.

......

Now Blue Mary and BK Power had caught up with Team Stealth, and merged 
briefly to cover them. Lurker, Stalker, and Snowblood were glad for the 
help (Ferret had gotten lost, but was safe with Lady Luck); Sanaa 
directed them to where they were having the most problems. A large 
armored creature, closely resembling a rocket-powered centaur, was 
fighting its way through the resistance, sometimes impaling heroes and 
threshing them like hay. Blue Mary cursed.

&quot;Lord Vyle,&quot; she addressed. She looked to Lurker and BK Power and 
gestured to them. &quot;You two, flank me, especially Lurker. Keep out of 
reach of that javelin. Beekay, watch those hooves as you come up from 
behind. I&#39;ll mount a full-frontal assault.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming too,&quot; said Snowblood. It was too late to argue; the small 
team was already on the way. As Lord Vyle thrashed yet another hapless 
hero, he turned around and laughed as the foursome advanced. He charged 
at them, thundering so hard that the asphalt was ground up and spat out. 
There was no way even the mightiest hero could stop him at that 
rate...but they didn&#39;t need to stop him directly. Lurker scurried up the 
nearest building she could find and jumped off when Vyle was underneath 
her&#151;now she clung to his face.

&quot;Get off, lizard!!&quot; spat the centaur. Lurker just roared that same 
animalistic snarl and started clawing at his armored face. Blue Mary and 
BK Power saw their chance, and ran after him now that he was distracted. 
Masterson took hold of his legs, pumping herself up to maximum power; 
Blue Mary ran up and plunged a sharp kick right in Vyle&#39;s glossy chest, 
knocking the centaur down. With his legs restrained, he fell quite 
easily.

&quot;My turn!&quot; shouted Snowblood. She ran after the large beast and slashed 
at him wildly, but the centaur wasn&#39;t defeated just yet. He yanked 
Lurker off, much as it wounded him (she had dug her claws right into his 
helmet, and prying her away nearly ripped his face off), and tossed her 
aside, then used his lance to prop himself back up again. Disregarding 
the scars on his side, he bucked wildly until BK Power fell off, and 
charged after Snowblood with every intention of flattening her. Blue 
Mary chased after him and shouted a challenge, but was blown away as she 
absorbed the full impact of his hind legs.

&quot;BASTARD!!!&quot; BK Power, enraged at seeing her idol beaten like that, 
surged with muscle and rage until she felt like she was overflowing. The 
woman turned into a blur as she ran right into Lord Vyle&#151;and, horribly, 
directly through him. She had went so fast and so hard, she tore a large 
hole right through him and came out the other way.

&quot;Ugh,&quot; grunted Snowblood, &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to know what that smell 
is.&quot; Lord Vyle stared down at the gaping hole in his body in confusion, 
and slowly turned to stare at the woman who had destroyed him. He 
grunted...but every effort was in vain. The monster fell down dead in 
moments, kicking up a huge dust cloud. Everyone breathed a sigh of 
relief.

&quot;Oh my god&#151;Mary!&quot; Power rushed over to where her idol had fallen, but 
she had to dig through a lot of rubble to get there. No problem: her 
strength and a flow of terrified adrenaline made the job a snap. But 
what awaited her was horrifying: Blue Mary had been smashed by the 
centaur&#39;s crippling kick, and being buried underneath all that debris 
hadn&#39;t helped her at all. Her body was busted, and she could barely even 
move.

&quot;Oh, Mary,&quot; wailed Power, kneeling down to cradle the limp woman. &quot;Mary, 
Mary... Are you all right?&quot; It was some time before she could reply.

&quot;...No. Bones...crushed. Body...numb. Can&#39;t see well. Hard to breathe. I 
can&#39;t taste anything except my own blood. I really got the wind knocked 
out of me, didn&#39;t I?&quot; She grinned feebly; Kris Masterson was nearly 
hysterical.

&quot;Don&#39;t die...okay? You can&#39;t die. You&#39;re Blue Mary, the greatest...&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; she croaked, &quot;but you&#39;re the only one who ever appreciated it. 
Never thought I&#39;d get a fan in all my years. I&#39;m...glad I met her.&quot; She 
smiled warmly, took Kris&#39;s hands, and held them close to her bleeding 
mouth, kissing. &quot;I&#39;m honored...to have fought next to...the world&#39;s 
greatest Blue Mary...fan. But now it&#39;s time for me to go. I can&#39;t 
recover from this, Kristen. I just can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t say things like that!&quot; shouted Kristen over the noise. Of course, 
that didn&#39;t matter now. Nothing mattered, not now. &quot;Don&#39;t say that,&quot; she 
repeated; &quot;you&#39;ll live! I&#39;ve seen you take worse!&quot;

&quot;Must&#39;ve been a long time ago,&quot; murmured Mary. She coughed violently, 
dribbling blood, and wheezed her last few breaths. &quot;Kristen,&quot; she said 
hoarsely, &quot;don&#39;t feel so depressed. I&#39;m not...as great a hero as you 
think I am. The life of a hero...is really not that great. It&#39;s 
horrible. It&#39;s one of the...worst jobs you could have. But somebody has 
to do it. If they don&#39;t...all this is for nothing.&quot; She gestured towards 
the battle; Kristen was now openly crying, everything else forgotten. 
Mary then breathed in her last, and kissed her ally&#39;s worn-out knuckles.

&quot;The world is in good hands,&quot; she said clearly. &quot;I&#39;m glad I got to meet 
you, Kris. I can die happy now that I&#39;ve met my biggest fan...and I know 
she&#39;ll be even better than I was.&quot; And that was it. That was all. There 
wasn&#39;t any more.

Watching from afar, Sanaa tightened her gun-belt and hiked off to the 
north.

&quot;Where do you think you&#39;re going?&quot; asked Stalker. The dark-skinned 
mercenary gave her a cold look.

&quot;To kill Garnet.&quot;

......

Sanaa, beautiful and cold, had only felt rage twice in her life. The 
first time was when Marissa had died fighting Kali; the second was just 
recently, when Blue Mary perished. It was odd feeling so angry at 
something like that, because Sanaa usually didn&#39;t let other people&#39;s 
deaths affect her. Up until she met Marissa and the others, every loss 
of life meant nothing to her&#151;it was like stepping on bugs. But 
now...things were different. She had borne hatred for Kali, and now her 
hatred extended to Garnet, the man who led this senseless attack. She 
had failed to avenge Marissa, but she would not fail again. She did not 
fear death, nor pain, nor anything. She would not be stopped.

But she certainly had to blast her way through a lot of enemies to get 
to him! Teams Alpha, Power, and Stealth shouted out to her&#151;stop, wait, 
come back, let us help&#151;but Sanaa&#39;s sharp senses tuned them out, so full 
of hatred was she. If anything, the extra surge of emotions gave her the 
energy to leap over the onslaught of enemies, blasting where she could. 
She was made and built for stealth and secrecy, but she could just as 
easily turn herself into a one-woman army. And now this beautiful work 
of art, this unnatural creation, had her deadly sights on the leader of 
the army: Garnet.

He wasn&#39;t what she suspected. Garnet was a beautiful young dark-skinned 
man, eyes so green that they pierced through Sanaa&#39;s defenses and crept 
into her soul. He had short, spiky brown hair, and a leather coat to 
cover his whole body. Her acute sense of vision saw that he bore the 
marks of Karin on his hands&#151;the great mythical beast, capricious and 
dangerous to friend and foe alike. He was riding atop what looked like a 
Naga, half-human and half-snake, and he was looking directly at Sanaa.

&quot;Let me off,&quot; he instructed calmly. The snake-creature slithered, 
allowing him to slip off and approach the woman. He waved a greeting 
(baring his arms to confirm his status as a Karin adept) and studied her 
for a long time. The only greeting Sanaa gave him was the greeting of 
two guns pointed right at his face.

&quot;I see,&quot; he said lamely. &quot;Well, I always did think introductions between 
enemies were pointless. Let&#39;s hope you&#39;re not the last one I have to 
face; there&#39;s another woman in here somewhere whom I vowed to destroy.&quot;

&quot;Guess I reached you first,&quot; Sanaa growled. Garnet snickered and threw 
off his coat, revealing a shapely male body wearing little more than 
athletic shorts. A normal person, man or woman, would&#39;ve been 
enthralled, but Sanaa was hardly normal. Only Marissa held her heart; 
this enemy was as vile to her as the zombies. They circled each other 
hastily for awhile, both running at top speed, Sanaa easily tracking 
him. She raised one of her guns to fire...Garnet suddenly halted and 
jumped back, firing blasts from his arm. Sanaa didn&#39;t quite expect this, 
but jumped out of the way, twirled around in midair, and returned fire. 
She got hit on the shoulder; he was grazed on his leg.

A pause. They resumed staring at each other&#151;then, Garnet tumbled to the 
side, jumped, and hovered in the air. Sanaa fired at him, a few bullets 
grazing by, some mysteriously bouncing off. An energy shield, perhaps? 
She cursed as he waved his hands and chanted in the arcane tongue of the 
Karin: hummas daa, hul-dim-draa, hummus kaa, drindle-baa, ekhtu KARIN!!! 
A serpentine creature emerged from his hands, as long as a mile and 
shimmering white with power. Sanaa knew it was pointless to fire and 
took to running, but Karin was faster than the greatest river, and soon 
caught up. The creature plowed into her full-force, smothering her with 
ice so frigid it could freeze the sun. Sanaa yelled in pain&#151;even her 
harsh training never pushed her that far&#151;and curled into a ball, alive 
but hardly well.

&quot;Like that, don&#39;t you?&quot; Garnet laughed. Sanaa growled&#151;pain was nothing, 
pain was nothing, pain was nothing (where had she heard that before?), 
pain was nothing&#151;she wheeled around and fired wildly. Garnet gasped, 
feeling his body peppered by the small projectiles. His arms went limp; 
his legs seared; his chest started to swell. He ground his teeth 
together and waved his hands again, chanting for his dragon familiar.

&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Sanaa purred, &quot;like I&#39;m really going to let you finish it.&quot; 
She fired&#151;the bullets bounced off again&#151;and cursed. But then she had an 
idea. She ran as far away as she could, allowing Garnet to summon his 
white ice-dragon, and curled around once she felt its icy presence. 
Sanaa pushed herself like she never had, now running as fast as a car 
could go, but instead of going away from Garnet, she ran toward him.

Straight towards him. The young man yelled in shock as he realized what 
she was doing, and turned to run. Sanaa caught up with him easily, the 
dragon directly behind her, and with a leap, she vaulted right over her 
enemy. The dragon was not quite so discerning, and plowed right into its 
own master. Sanaa, with her brutal years of training in the harshest 
environments, had barely managed to survive. She didn&#39;t think Garnet 
would have that same luxury.

And so, taking a breath of victory, she left the frozen man dead in the 
streets&#151;but just to make sure, she plugged him three times in the head. 
That was it, then. One down, two to go.

.........

Several hours passed, but even with the death of Garnet, the situation 
did not improve much. During the fighting, more and more heroes fell to 
their doom, even as their enemies perished along with them. Mega-girl 
was torn apart by a creature called the Ripper, and Sergeant Bizarro was 
also killed by the monster, before Law and Justice stepped in to finish 
it off. Miltorkka was gone, thanks to the Twin Towers, but they had both 
been wounded in the battle and wouldn&#39;t be able to participate for 
awhile. A small band of healthy individuals gathered inside an abandoned 
building to go over their next plan.

&quot;With Garnet gone, all we have left are Kissa and Malchior,&quot; Shalis 
announced. &quot;According to Kathy, Kissa is the one most responsible for 
drawing out the warriors of old, but Malchior revives most of the 
low-level zombies. For the time being, I&#39;d rather not have to face the 
more powerful people; it&#39;s been proven we can wipe out the zombies 
easily.&quot;

&quot;So we go after Kissa,&quot; stated the Spoon Man. Shalis nodded.

&quot;We don&#39;t need a large force. Most of us should stay behind and continue 
the fight. There are plenty of wounded too, so if anybody has any 
medical experience, now&#39;s the time to bring it out.&quot;

&quot;I could definitely use the help,&quot; murmured Mora. She had been the main 
source of recovery&#151;after all, snakes were well-known for their healing 
powers&#151;and while she had Marissa, Aura, and Alyssa with her in the ward, 
she would need an army just to keep up with the demand.

&quot;We&#39;re stretched everywhere,&quot; Shalis told her, &quot;it can&#39;t be helped. Just 
keep doing your best. I&#39;ve already sent a team to scout out any heroes 
who specialize in healing. Now what about this team that&#39;s going after 
Kissa? Any volunteers?&quot;

&quot;Yo!!&quot; No surprise that Rin the Ronin volunteered first, Kailin right 
behind her. &quot;I still got a bone to pick with that weirdo, so we&#39;re going 
first. Whaddya say, Setsie? Wanna join the Ronin?&quot;

&quot;It would be my pleasure,&quot; said Snowblood. Ferret, who was more or less 
an unofficial member of the Ronin team, was out looking for healers; the 
Guardian Angel&#39;s voice came in softly and meekly, almost inaudible at 
first.

&quot;I will go,&quot; she said, and repeated herself. &quot;I owe Kissa a debt. I must 
go to her and claim it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we gotta get that stuff settled!&quot; exclaimed Rin, pumping her arms 
up and down vigorously.

&quot;You had better hurry, then,&quot; said Shalis as she calmed the feisty 
warrior down. &quot;The more time we waste, the more time she has to bring 
back our old enemies. You don&#39;t want to fight an undead version of 
Sashuo or Indira now, do you?&quot;

&quot;Of course not! The real things were bad enough!&quot; The four Ronin set out 
on their quest about two minutes later, just as soon as they packed 
their supplies. Kailin missed the extra weight BaoBao figured in, but a 
battlefield was no place for a panda, even one as helpful and cute as 
she.

The path to Kissa was strewn with living corpses. The four Ronin had to 
fight with every last ounce of strength they possessed to clear through 
the endless troops. Guardian Angel took the lead, letting her eyes spy 
out the quickest path to their enemy; Ronin and Snowblood were directly 
behind her, fending off creatures both living and dead, and Inferno took 
the rear, making sure they were not followed as she set a deadly blaze 
to their tails. Sometimes, a great wall of beasts stood before the 
quartet, and they had to stand still and fight for what seemed like 
hours, moving and twisting like heavenly ballerinas.

But of course, Kissa would protect herself with the sturdiest warriors 
imaginable. The four Ronin were all worthy fighters, each one excellent 
at what she did, but it took them ages to plow through the enemy lines: 
it was so thick, the streets were black with their number. Inferno 
sometimes took the lead and turned her powers on full-blast, 
incinerating everything just so they could have a few seconds&#39; lead. She 
and Guardian Angel fought together flawlessly, just as Ronin and 
Snowblood equalized each other. Both on and off the battlefield, they 
were all perfect for each other...but of course, even perfection can 
sometimes be challenged.

About ninety minutes after they first set out, the quartet came to 
Kissa&#39;s lair, which was little more than a raised platform where she 
stood surveying her work. The copper-skinned sorceress got to see the 
four Ronin in action personally, as she commanded two large Minotaurs to 
attack them. They gave the girls a tough fight, but were dispatched 
eventually. Finally, at last, Rin and Kailin cornered their savior and 
their bane, with Setsuka and Kathy beside them. Kissa stared at them for 
a long time before she spoke.

&quot;Ingrates,&quot; she snorted. &quot;And after all the things I did for you.&quot;

&quot;Shut up! We&#39;re not your soldiers or your toys! What makes you think you 
can control us like that, sending us out to do your dirty work!?&quot;

&quot;We had a deal,&quot; she shrugged, inching backwards subtly. &quot;I gave the two 
of you life, and yet you&#39;ve betrayed me. Well, I guess this means you 
were happier being dead.&quot; Her eyes suddenly flickered as she waved her 
left hand, and in a flash, both Rin and Kailin were caught in an 
electric field, suspending them in midair. They screamed&#151;and froze, 
their facial expressions terrifying. Both Snowblood and Angel yelled in 
outrage.

&quot;You monster! What have you done?!&quot; Kissa laughed, cruel and gleeful.

&quot;They&#39;re not dead, dears,&quot; she told them&#151;&quot;Merely in suspended animation. 
I could kill them, but I rather like playing with my pets. Not my toys, 
you said?! Then what am I doing now?&quot; She jerked her fingers; Rin and 
Kailin&#39;s arms and legs twitched accordingly. Kissa laughed again, and 
faced her new tormentors. &quot;And you are?&quot;

&quot;Lady Snowblood,&quot; hissed the blind woman darkly. &quot;And it is the last 
name you shall ever hear.&quot; Setsuka charged&#151;Rin was helpless to save 
her&#151;and soon she too was frozen. Kissa laughed even harder as she added 
a third doll to her collection, and finally turned to address the 
Guardian Angel.

&quot;My sweet Kathryn,&quot; she cooed, &quot;you have not quite betrayed me yet. 
There&#39;s still hope for you, dear. If you cooperate with me, I can 
guarantee the safe return of your friend. Think about it! Your beloved 
Sarah, back from the dead, alive and well in your arms, where she 
belongs! Isn&#39;t it lovely?&quot; Angel quivered as she stared Kissa down. She 
wept, her feet wobbly, her voice broken.

&quot;You bitch,&quot; she whispered. &quot;You heartless whore! How dare you...&quot;

&quot;Or I could use your pals as bargaining chips,&quot; said the sorceress, 
twitching her fingers again. Angel hissed as the three women writhed 
around helplessly, and demanded that Kissa stop. &quot;Stop?!&quot; she laughed, 
&quot;But why should I? It&#39;s such fun! Oh, all right, I will stop, but only 
if you obey me. And I&#39;ll even bring back little Miss Sarah, just because 
I&#39;m feeling so generous. What do you say, my dear? Exchange your 
services for their lives? Hmm???&quot;

It was a choice nobody should have to make, least of all a soul as 
gentle, tender, and loving as Kathryn&#39;s. Sarah had lived a cursed life; 
Kathy had been her only friend. She had died right in her arms, beaten 
to death by her own father. Kathy had went to beg Kissa for her 
services, to bring back Sarah at any cost, and Kissa agreed, keeping the 
Guardian Angel around as her &quot;special pet&quot; until she felt ready to call 
forth the girl&#39;s soul. Angel remembered a time when she would&#39;ve given 
anything to have Sarah back, but now...

&quot;No,&quot; she stated, firm and mature beyond her years. &quot;I could never live 
with myself if I betrayed my friends and the girl I love. Sarah wouldn&#39;t 
want that! You,&quot; she snarled, flashing her eyes wide open, &quot;can rot in 
Hell for all I care! You and your damned bargains!!&quot; Angel sped after 
Kissa so quickly that the woman had no time to retaliate. She felt the 
young girl, so abysmally powerful, latch her hands around her magic 
bracelets&#151;her only weakness&#151;and shrieked as Guardian Angel smashed them 
in her grip.

For the longest time, Kissa stared at Kathryn O&#39;Hare, the last person 
she ever expected to fight back. And not just to fight back: in all her 
years of life, over 3000 of them, she never expected a person like her 
to actually end her life, tossing her soul into the abyss for eternity. 
She certainly didn&#39;t expect the Angel to turn her back on Sarah, never 
to see her again.

&quot;You...fool,&quot; she whispered, her very last words. Kissa fell back, her 
life no longer hers, and dropped to the ground, turning to dust 
instantly. The wind blew her remains away; the bracelets she wore that 
kept her life going, the source of her strength and immortality, were 
now brittle shards. Some had stuck in Kathy&#39;s palm, so she carefully 
picked them out and tossed them away. She ground them apart with her 
foot and swept them away, making sure they were all destroyed. Then, 
almost as an afterthought, she turned to her friends. They had been 
freed the moment those bracelets were destroyed.

&quot;Everyone all right?&quot; she asked, her voice sounding hundreds of years 
old. They nodded quietly. &quot;Well, that&#39;s good. We still have a war to 
fight, don&#39;t we?&quot; She was the first to walk away, back into the carnage, 
and Kailin wanted to follow her. Rin placed her hand on the girl&#39;s 
shoulder, shaking her head. It was best not to disturb Kathy, not until 
she let all this sink in. Sadly, Kailin turned around and embraced Rin; 
the older woman hugged her back, as gently as she could.

.........

Over the next few hours of daylight, the enemy forces dwindled, but the 
remaining cultists continued to fight. More heroes and villains were 
killed, more hearts were broken and more wills were overcome. Just when 
it seemed like the second day would never end, the sun yawned and fell 
into its nightly slumber, slowly ushering in the indifferent stars and 
the apathetic moon. After two long days of fighting, the heroes were 
ultimately repulsed by the sheer number of the enemies, and fell back to 
recover and regroup. One of the people injured the most was Pandora the 
Gambler: she had been attacked by a zombie, and though the monster was 
now destroyed, it had taken a chunk of her arm with it. Knowing what 
would happen to her if she didn&#39;t act fast, Pandora braced herself and 
stabbed the infected area with a white-hot crucifix Priest had given 
her.

But Priest was not there; Soma was all by herself. She rested high atop 
one of the buildings, the sky her only ceiling, her arm vibrating with 
unimaginable pain. Still, it could be worse.

&quot;Yup, here you are,&quot; came a familiar voice. Soma looked over and saw 
Alyssa Hunter, the Siren, approaching her. Okay, now it was worse.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;Father Pochanski said you&#39;d be here. He said I should come up and take 
a look at your arm. What happened, you get hurt?&quot;

&quot;No, I did this on purpose because I&#39;m a sadist,&quot; came a snorted reply. 
Alyssa cringed. She walked over and knelt down, reaching for the arm. 
Pandora jerked it away. &quot;Touch me,&quot; she warned, &quot;and you die.&quot;

&quot;Settle down, I&#39;ll just take a look at it. Can you move it?&quot; Pandora 
snorted, but she decided to humor her &quot;nurse&quot; and wiggled her shoulder, 
about the only part of her arm that still functioned. The rest was numb; 
she had driven the crucifix right through her flesh until it came out 
the other end. Alyssa turned a little white as she examined it.

&quot;My God.&quot;

&quot;Fine choice of words,&quot; Soma murmured, referring to the cross embedded 
in her arm. Alyssa looked sick. She looked right into Soma&#39;s only 
functioning eye and spoke to her, calmly and seriously.

&quot;Look, my spirit powers can heal wounds. I don&#39;t know if it will do any 
good against the mark of the undead, but I could at least give it a 
try.&quot;

&quot;So shouldn&#39;t you be saving the other freaks?&quot;

&quot;Father Pochanski said that you needed help the most. Frankly, even I&#39;m 
a bit skeptical about all this. I mean, you&#39;re not exactly friendly to 
us...freaks.&quot; That last word was clearly self-depreciating humor, and 
Pandora actually snickered. She hoisted her dead arm up with her other 
hand, wondering if this stupid little Siren could really cure her.

&quot;So the Priest tries to help me again, huh? And he sends you to do it. 
Well, makes sense. You&#39;re the only person who keeps trying to talk to me 
no matter what I say. So what&#39;ll it take to get you to go away?&quot;

&quot;Just...let me try,&quot; Siren said, reaching for the arm. Pandora pulled it 
away.

&quot;You realize I don&#39;t trust you, right? And I might reach out to choke 
you if you get close enough.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but would you really? I mean, let&#39;s face it&#151;I&#39;m the lesser of two 
evils here.&quot; Soma sighed, but much as she hated to admit it, Siren was 
right. The woman did have her uses. Soma relented and let the younger 
woman do what she could, but she gave her a Cyclops&#39; glare.

&quot;Just remember, I&#39;m only letting you do this because you still have a 
use. Killing you now would be pointless. Once all this is over, I&#39;ll 
come after you and stick your head on a pike.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Siren muttered. She gently took Soma&#39;s arm into her 
hands, closed her eyes, and guided the spirits around the wound. Soma 
felt a cleansing chill seep over her arm, and winced painfully as Alyssa 
removed the crucifix. The hole was quickly sewn up, the blood washed 
away, and even the zombie&#39;s bite mark vanished until there was nothing 
left but a faint red mark. Some still couldn&#39;t move her arm, but at 
least she wouldn&#39;t have that thing inside her, and she wouldn&#39;t faint 
from blood loss.

&quot;Finished,&quot; Alyssa said. &quot;Now try moving it. Flex your fingers first.&quot; 
Now Soma really grimaced. She never had trouble moving any part of her 
body before, so this strain was a new feeling. Eventually her fingers 
came back to life, and she could make a soft fist. She let out a breath 
of relief and started rubbing life back into her arm.

&quot;Good as new,&quot; she muttered. She threw her &quot;nurse&quot; a placid look, 
tipping her hat politely. &quot;I guess I should say thanks. And I know the 
perfect way to repay you.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Now Soma smiled, maybe too sweetly.

&quot;When I go on my hero-killing rampage, I&#39;ll save you for last. And I&#39;ll 
fight you fairly.&quot;

&quot;Ah. What an honor.&quot; Alyssa knew she wasn&#39;t going to get anything better 
than that&#151;it was a miracle Soma hadn&#39;t thrown her off the roof already. 
The Gambler started nodding off, and told her guest to scram before she 
changed her mind. Alyssa left the older woman to her privacy, but she 
didn&#39;t go very far. Odd&#151;out of all the people she could&#39;ve spent that 
night with, she spent it watching over Soma von Zomren.

.........

Three whole days&#151;that was how long everyone had been at war. They had 
plenty to show for their efforts: Garnet was now dead, and Kissa with 
him, plus at least a dozen supervillains and countless other minor 
thugs. The cost was tremendous, though, with fifty confirmed losses on 
the good side, fourteen of them now consumed by the insatiable thirst of 
the undead. As the six main forces gathered together for the day&#39;s 
planning stages, some of them felt that this would be the end&#151;but would 
it be theirs or the enemy&#39;s? It felt like things were going to conclude 
somehow that day, and so some of the more optimistic people started to 
hope.

It was unanimously decided that the Savage Six would combine all of 
their teams to initiate a blitzkrieg on Malchior, last of the major 
powers involved. Once he was out of the picture, it would be easier to 
get the masses of undead under control&#151;some, in fact, believed they 
would simply return to their graves once their source of power was 
gone&#151;and then it would be a matter of picking off the remaining 
villains. Once that was done......

&quot;Let&#39;s not get too ahead of ourselves,&quot; Priest warned everybody. &quot;First 
we have to find the Dark Scion, then conceive a way of defeating him. 
From what Stalker has told us, he seems reluctant to battle against 
other dark forces, so she will lead the attack with Paradox. We will set 
up a large perimeter and act as a barrier should the Scion try to 
escape, and one by one our forces will pummel him. This was the way we 
defeated Anvil, and it hasn&#39;t failed us since.&quot; Mentioning the 
recently-resurrected &quot;ultravillain&quot; sent many of the forces shaking and 
trembling. They had heard enough horror stories from the Savage Six to 
be genuinely afraid of the creature, and hoped it wouldn&#39;t come down to 
a second showdown.

&quot;We should leave soon,&quot; Paradox said vaguely. &quot;I am always prepared, 
since I don&#39;t require rest or nourishment. Stalker, Team Surprise, when 
you are ready, come see me. I want to be alone for awhile.&quot; The 
enigmatic man wandered off, leaving his comrades to shuffle around for 
last-minute preparations. As she numbly chewed a protein bar, Psyche 
suddenly froze, a look of concentrated surprise on her face.

&quot;What is it?&quot; Sanaa whispered as she took her lover&#39;s hand. She knew 
what Marissa was capable of, and if the pale woman was sensing 
something...

&quot;A force stronger than any I&#39;ve ever felt,&quot; she murmured, slowly rising 
to her feet. &quot;It does not seem to be living, and yet it is not dead. The 
creature draws close. I can feel the dark energy flowing from this 
being. The lust for destruction is great.&quot;

&quot;I sense it too,&quot; said Snowblood. Disintegrator turned to Skye, nodding 
her head in recognition. Even her weak telekinetic senses were picking 
it up&#151;and soon, amazingly, even those without psychic abilities could 
feel it.

&quot;Such terrible energy,&quot; whispered Ferret, shivering despite the warm 
morning air. Paradox came running back, the look on his mystifying face 
saying everything: it was Anvil, and he was getting close.

&quot;Everyone brace yourselves!&quot; barked Captain Amazing, shooting to his 
feet. The entire force stood up, many of them bristling like cats in the 
presence of a vicious dog. Now, aside from feeling the wicked energy 
emanating from their terrible foe, some with sharper senses could smell 
it as well: it stank of corpses, rotting flesh, and rancid evil, mixed 
with rivers of blood. Somebody vomited. Hands were held in support.

&quot;Whatever happens, milady,&quot; Ferret whispered to Aura, &quot;stay behind me 
and don&#39;t let go of my hand.&quot; She nodded sharply, waiting for the demon 
to show itself. A figure rose up from the horizon...

And stopped, suddenly, barely reaching a meter in height.

Most of the heroes stared in awe. Anvil was...a midget??

&quot;That can&#39;t be him!&quot; Ronin exclaimed, forcing herself not to laugh at 
the ridiculous sight. The being before them was a puny thing, barely the 
length of Priest&#39;s arm, and except for a crescent-shaped silvery area, 
Anvil was bald as well. He looked more like a dwarf or a gnome, except 
without the beard, and was dressed in a humble brown tunic, bearing no 
weapons save his tiny fists. Ronin finally lost control and belted out a 
nasty laugh&#151;but nobody else joined her.

&quot;Watch it,&quot; hissed Morpheus, getting into a fighting stance. &quot;His size 
is part of the ruse. It puts his enemies off their guard while he 
attacks. We&#39;ve seen it before.&quot;

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry so much,&quot; she said, waving him off. &quot;I&#39;m sure that back 
in your day, he was a challenge, but this is a different era! C&#39;mere, 
little fella. Let me rub your head.&quot; She beckoned to the diminutive 
villain, who even in life, hated being taunted for his size. With pure 
rage Anvil charged&#151;and was stopped short as Ronin held him back with her 
hand. He swung his fists in vain; she was well out of his reach.

&quot;This is fun!&quot; she exclaimed, waving and taunting further. &quot;Whaddya say, 
Inferno? Wanna have a crack at this little guy? Hey, maybe BaoBao would 
find him amusing.&quot;

&quot;Watch it, Rin!&quot; she shouted. Anvil nearly made contact as he swatted, 
but Rin&#39;s arms were considerably longer than his, and she easily dodged. 
Finally she grew tired, and kicked the small evil away, sending him 
crashing through a building. The Ronin dusted her hands off and smiled 
victoriously, but she didn&#39;t get the cheers and adulation she expected.

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s up, guys? C&#39;mon, I just beat the great almighty Anvil here. 
Jeez, you&#39;d think I robbed an old lady, what with the looks you&#39;re 
giving me. ...Guys?&quot; The team was no longer staring at her for her 
audacity, but beyond her, to the building she had sent Anvil through. 
They stared because...no, it couldn&#39;t be. It couldn&#39;t be. It was 
impossible! Ronin jerked around to see what the big fuss was about...and 
gazed in horror, her legs shaking, as the entire building rose up from 
the ground, ascending by the same puny arms that had been trying to 
swing at her. Anvil was lifting the entire building!

&quot;Oh my sweet Lord in Heaven,&quot; she whispered, feeling overwhelmed from 
the chill. Beneath the massive structure, no signs of strain on his face 
at all, Anvil grinned and threw the building with startling ease. There 
was no way any of them could avoid it&#151;they would be smashed into a 
pulp!! Psyche quickly put all her focus on the flying monstrosity, and 
with every shred of power in her, managed to hurl the building away into 
the sky, where it would float into orbit and be lost in space. She 
collapsed from overwhelming herself; Anvil just snorted, rummaged 
through the wrecked remains, and picked up a long steel beam, its size 
and weight pointless to him.

&quot;MOVE!!!&quot; Everyone scattered as the weapon swung; some of the quicker 
heroes shot back with whatever projectiles they had. Effortlessly, Anvil 
clutched the steel beam in one hand and blocked the shots with his 
other, not even getting his palm singed. He resumed running and swinging 
without delay, but the good news was that, having such stubby legs, he 
couldn&#39;t run very fast. After making sure her lover was safe, Sanaa 
returned to the battle and unloaded on Anvil, spraying him with bullets. 
She was quick enough to stay one step ahead of the massive weapon, but 
even as she pelted him, he didn&#39;t seem to slow down.

&quot;What the hell&#39;s this guy made out of, steel?&quot; she wondered. Well, if 
her small arms were useless, she simply needed bigger weapons. Sanaa 
kept a Phantom MG-59 straddled to her back for such heavy-duty 
occasions, and whipped it out with a sick smile. Technically an illegal 
weapon due to its highly destructive nature, the Phantom could chew 
through just about anything in moments. Sanaa had seen it devour a steel 
security door like the thing was made out of paper, and its only flaw 
was its incredible slow loading time and the spine-shattering recoil. 
Sanaa was unaware of anyone else who could handle the weapon: she had 
trained a whole month just to wield it.

Because of its loading time, she would have to get in close and 
personal&#151;much easier said than done. Rancor had tried the frontal 
approach and was sent hurtling through the sky, despite wearing her 
thickest level of armor. Right now, Lurker and Snowblood were keeping 
their distances while trying to sneak a shot, and if her senses were 
still working, then Ferret was down there with them, using her 
invaluable ghosting skills to sneak up and disable the small villain. 
Her spiritual form finally caught up and squeezed Anvil, disabling him 
for a fraction of a moment&#151;the perfect time for Sanaa to strike! She ran 
in at full speed, still wary of the beam, lifted the Phantom, and aimed 
right between his eyes, expecting the head to pop open in a gory 
explosion.

Instead, the deadly projectile burrowed straight through his head, past 
Ferret&#39;s ghost (who naturally remained unaffected), and into an 
abandoned building, blasting off a small chunk. Anvil shivered his head, 
paused briefly to consider what happened to him, and then wrestled free 
from Ferret&#39;s grasp to attack Sanaa.

&quot;Shit,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I forgot the bastard was undead.&quot; She leaped away 
to safety, but then Anvil pulled another surprise and belched a long 
white beam of energetic power from his mouth, engulfing Sanaa with 
searing hot light. She screamed in pain&#151;this was just as bad as Garnet&#39;s 
Karin attack&#151;and rolled to safety, trying to ignore the flashes of agony 
her body pulsated with. Her skin was horribly burnt, literally black and 
peeling away, but she knew she was alive because she felt the pain. If 
she had stayed in that beam for just a second longer...

Nobody was faring well. Anvil was fireproof, as Inferno learned the hard 
way, and his skin was so thick that even at her highest level, BK Power 
did little more than throw him a great distance. Snowblood actually 
broke her sword apart as she tried to slash him, and Anvil was too 
powerful to be crushed by G-Force&#39;s magnitude. Venom thought she would 
fare better, but in order to kill him, she would have to get in very 
close and embrace him with her whole naked body&#151;something even the 
craziest person would never try. Phobia tried unleashing her 
powers&#151;without restrain this time&#151;but the dead have no fear, and Anvil 
just regarded her with silent indifference.

&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; muttered Thunder-Claw as he sat back, catching his 
breath. He and a few others were watching as their friends tried again 
and again to destroy Anvil, but so far all they did was slow him down or 
throw him around. Nothing was working! No wonder the Savage Six feared 
him. Wait&#151;the Savage Six had fought this monster before, and won! Anvil 
was undead today because once, long ago, he had died. All they needed to 
do was repeat the actions of several years ago!

He raced to find them, and first ran into Psyche, who was using her 
psychic powers to heal Sanaa. The damage was extensive, and Psyche was 
still worn-out from her last defensive action, so it would take a long 
time. But when he proposed his idea, they took to it instantly and rose 
up to assist him, in spite of their wounds. Between the three of them, 
they gathered the Six together quickly, but when they told them their 
plan, the reaction was grim.

&quot;Impossible,&quot; Morpheus said. &quot;If he were alive, there might not be a 
problem. The mere fact that he is now undead and much less susceptible 
to harm throws all our plans out the window. If we execute the same plan 
that worked the last time, it would fail. The entire thing depended on 
him being a living, and therefore fallible being.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do?&quot; Steve asked. Shift shook his head.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Venom and Priest would be perfect, but we can&#39;t get in 
close. The advantage of having such short limbs is that Anvil can 
prevent anyone from attacking him directly. And he&#39;s invulnerable to 
projectiles and energy blasts, so we can&#39;t disable him.&quot;

&quot;What about Alisti?&quot; suggested Marissa. &quot;Do you think she could use her 
powers?&quot; Now Lady Wonder shook her head.

&quot;The last time we heard from her, she was busy engaging our enemies on 
the other side of the city. We can send a messenger, but they will have 
to stay behind to take care of the enemies.&quot;

&quot;Make it happen.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t work, you know,&quot; murmured Captain Amazing once the envoy was 
gone. He gave his old allies a somber look. &quot;Anvil will find a way 
through it. Even while he was alive, the man was a mindless demon, a 
force too out of control to be destroyed. There is only one guaranteed 
way we can stop him&#151;and it may cost us.&quot;

&quot;Gaul, no,&quot; whispered Priest, leaning forth in fear. &quot;If you&#39;re thinking 
about that...don&#39;t, please. Don&#39;t les Cassie&#39;s sacrifice be for 
nothing.&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s Cassie?&quot; asked Marissa. Pochanski grumbled deeply, forcing 
himself to unbury past traumas.

&quot;Once we were known as the Savage Seven. We had a member named Cassie 
Frankas, who we proudly called Needles. When we fought against Anvil, 
she was the one who actually killed him.&quot;

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;She rushed in head-on,&quot; he said, sounding as lively as a crypt. &quot;Her 
body was broken to pieces by the time she wrapped her arms around him 
and activated the explosive device she had worn. The blast was powerful 
enough to take out a whole city block, plus our foe with it. Even then, 
his body remained whole, charred to a husk. It was our task to separate 
him into pieces, just so we could confirm his demise. And now, Gaul, are 
you thinking the same thing?&quot;

&quot;...It may have to be done,&quot; he said at last, sounding dead on the 
inside. &quot;If any one of us does it, it should be me. And this time, we 
must make sure that his body is destroyed beyond redemption.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so hasty, Captain,&quot; Paradox said. &quot;We may not have to be so 
dramatic. If we can keep Anvil down to a crawl and wait until the 
Disintegrator arrives, it may be possible to amplify her powers. If Miss 
Wainright here and I put our forces together,&quot; he nodded in her 
direction, &quot;it should be possible to summon up enough energy to wipe him 
out.&quot;

&quot;A bold idea,&quot; the Captain admitted. &quot;But Anvil will not sit still and 
let it happen. Someone will have to keep him still. I volunteer for 
that.&quot; Under normal circumstances, somebody would&#39;ve spoken up and 
protested, but they knew it was useless. The Captain knew what he was 
doing, and besides, he felt it was his responsibility as the team 
leader. Everyone split up and spread the word; soon a task force was 
assembled for the last battle against the unstoppable Anvil.

......

When Alisti was explained the situation, she hesitated. Skye was there 
with her, and the two were fighting well against the enemy forces. It 
took two of the three messengers to remain before she promised to go 
back&#151;selfish, perhaps, but even with her new body and clear mind, 
Kreager was tough negotiating with. While she and the remaining envoy 
raced back to rendezvous with Paradox and Psyche, Captain Amazing flew 
in to the main battle, found Anvil wandering around without anyone to 
challenge him, and descended to remedy that error.

&quot;Remember me?&quot; he purred darkly. Anvil cringed. Of course he did. The 
two locked horns like one stampede of bulls against the other, pummeling 
each other with attacks too fierce and quick to believe. A few covered 
their faces in horror, but many more watched with untrembling eyes, 
realizing that this was a duel for the ages. The spectators scattered 
when they noticed a flare explode, the signal that a major strike was 
about to commence. A few blocks away and several stories high, Alisti 
Kreager stared at her target with complete concentration. Even with her 
radical power, she wouldn&#39;t be able to blast him alone.

&quot;Just stay focused,&quot; Psyche whispered to her as she took her hand. The 
older woman started to hum, then shiver, then pulsate: she was diverting 
her power into Alisti, magnifying the Disintegrator&#39;s blast to a 
considerably higher level. Yet even then...

&quot;This is going to get mighty ugly,&quot; Paradox muttered as he took 
Kreager&#39;s hand and focused his powers into her. Alisti felt like every 
bit and piece of her very self was shooting higher and higher, breaking 
and boosting through barriers that seemed impassable. She felt she was 
going to explode from the power...but knew just where she could focus 
all that excess energy on. Below, Captain Amazing was keeping Anvil at 
bay, using his own body as an anchor. But would he really stay there and 
be evaporated...?

&quot;Don&#39;t think about it!&quot; growled Paradox, his every word straining to get 
out. &quot;Just do it. Gaul knew what he was getting into when he 
volunteered. Besides, what&#39;s a hero worth when the evil in the world is 
gone? Soon we will all perish; it is the duty of the young to keep this 
land peaceful!&quot; Alisti shivered in fear, but knew everything would be up 
to her. Despite her former tendency for destruction and mischief, deep 
down she was a compassionate person, one who sought an end to all 
violence and misery, especially her own. Without holding anything back, 
she focused her disintegrating powers solely on Anvil, willing for every 
bit of it to fall on his shoulders.

Down below, as Captain Amazing struggled with his nemesis, Anvil&#39;s face 
suddenly flashed with surprise. In an instant&#151;though time seemed to slow 
to a crawl to allow every tiny detail to be processed&#151;his body burst 
open, every area exploding out in a messy, gory, dusty mess. The 
splatter was soon evaporated as Alisti&#39;s power came fully down, and for 
the last brief seconds before his demise, Captain Amazing sighed.

&quot;It&#39;s finished. At last, it&#39;s all over.&quot;

The explosion obliterated an enormous chunk of the city, carving a 
sphere-shaped hole so great, it looked like a meteor had crashed. 
Everything inside the blast radius was completely eradicated.

Alisti and Marissa fainted from having exhausted so much of their 
combined power, leaving Paradox on his own. He stood shakily, dusted 
himself off, and willed the girls to float as he made his way to 
shelter. That was it, then: the greatest was gone for good.

......

Captain Amazing was not the only one to go: Law was taken down as well, 
pelted with flaming arrows until the fire consumed his body. Justice 
swept out to avenge him, but was drawn into the deadly embrace of Dr. 
Killgore and destroyed. He too met a satisfying end: Morpheus caused him 
to sleep, and the lumbering Mighty Jo smashed his body before she too 
tumbled to the ground, her abdomen split open and bleeding. She had 
absorbed a missile from one of the enemy jets, but took four of them 
down as a final act of vengeance. Those who remained gathered together 
to lick their wounds and resume the task they had started: the 
destruction of the Dark Scion.

&quot;That task will not be yours,&quot; said a scathingly familiar voice during 
the briefing. Only the newcomers needed to turn around to see who spoke; 
the others knew instantly, and shuddered with anger. It was him.

&quot;And just what,&quot; demanded Stalker, &quot;gives you the right to claim the 
Scion&#39;s life, especially when you weren&#39;t around to help?&quot;

&quot;I will not answer that question,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is my task and mine 
alone. If you wish to join me, I will stop you. Malchior will benefit 
most from a confrontation with me.&quot;

&quot;Let him go,&quot; grumbled Rancor, who was just as sick of Mr. White as 
everyone else was. &quot;It&#39;s two nuisances out of our hair, so I&#39;m not 
complaining. But he&#39;d better be stopped by the time you show your creepy 
face again.&quot;

&quot;I guarantee it,&quot; he vowed, and vanished. The Savage Six&#151;or those who 
were left&#151;inhaled sharply at the new marvel.

&quot;Who...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t wanna know,&quot; Merry said, helping Cobra patch another wound. 
&quot;And it&#39;s not like any of us know either.&quot;

Malchior, the Dark Scion, regarded the battlefield with disdain. To his 
count, about half the army was wiped out, maybe more, and it was getting 
harder and harder to supplement more undead forces. He found a stray 
hero and drained him of his life-force, and now looked and felt young 
enough to go toe-to-toe with the best of them. With Kissa and now Anvil 
absent, he was going to have a tough time realizing his dream, but it 
could still be done. After all, he was over a thousand years old. A 
little thing like this wouldn&#39;t set him back by much, not at all.

And then, as if a flame of purest white lit up in his black cave-world, 
it came before him.

&quot;Dark Scion!&quot; addressed the flaming creature, glaring with an icy smile. 
&quot;Dark Scion! Come before me! You and I have a confrontation to attend!&quot; 
Malchior was frightened, but only at first. He knew in his mind, through 
deep and winding labyrinths, that this was no mere superhero before him, 
but a creature damned from description, something so outrageous and 
otherworldly that it could only be...

&quot;You,&quot; he shivered, too angry to shout. &quot;You are a servant of that 
sadistic deity, the one who calls Himself a God! You are a son of 
Kurios!&quot;

&quot;You know much, Dark one,&quot; Thirteen responded. &quot;You must also know that 
your time has drawn to a close. This meddling in the dark arts will 
cease, and you will be cast into the hateful abyss.&quot;

&quot;Like Hell I will!&quot; he spat, brandishing his arm. Thirteen grinned.

&quot;That is the idea. Come now. Do not make me waste my time. There are 
people counting on me.&quot; The syrupy-sweet voice of his was like nails on 
a chalkboard; Malchior knelt down and threw loose bits of debris and 
stone at the floating man in white, lacing every toss with a curse.

&quot;Get thee down to Hell, you most accursed abomination of Kurios! You 
serve a false God&#151;a god that remains invisible, inaudible, and inactive! 
Is this &#39;god&#39; all-loving? Is he &#39;all-present&#39;? Is he &#39;all-merciful&#39;, and 
&#39;all-holy&#39;, and &#39;all-just&#39;? NO! There is no such thing!! The god you 
serve is a wicked, hateful, selfish, sadistic, bloodthirsty, 
hypocritical, evil, spiteful, whore&#39;s son!

&quot;Where was this god when a boy was beaten by his father just for looking 
different?! Where was god when this boy&#39;s mother was taken from him&#151;the 
only light in his life&#151;forcing him to flee or else suffer a life of 
torture?! Where was god when one of his...children was burned alive, AT 
THE STAKE, while onlookers laughed and cheered?! I will tell you 
where&#151;he was not there! There was never such a god! There never was! 
There is no love, no mercy, no justice in this world! Do you think I 
wanted to take this damned path in life?! Do you think I wanted to study 
the dark arts, to corrupt the souls of the dead, and to perform 
forbidden acts of sorcery damned by the bloated, foolish, incompetent 
church? I DID IT SO THAT I COULD SURVIVE IN THE WORLD THAT HE HIMSELF 
HATED!!!! Don&#39;t you see&#151;he has no right to condemn me!

&quot;Answer me, demon,&quot; he murmured, his voice almost gone thanks to so much 
screeching. &quot;Tell me. Give me my answers. Where was this god you serve 
so blindly? Where was the love that his damned mortal children were 
supposed to receive? Tell me. Tell me! I am on my knees, begging you to 
tell me!!!&quot; Malchior fell down, just as he said this, spreading his arms 
for one final mercy. Thirteen looked at him seriously, hovering very 
close. In a flash, he did the unthinkable and slashed at Malchior&#39;s left 
eye, destroying it and leaving a great chasm as a scar.

For this final indignity, the Dark Scion made the heavens groan with his 
cries.

But not long after, as the initial shock and pain cleared away, 
Malchior&#39;s remaining eye became clear, so clear and so pure that he 
stopped screaming, took in slow breaths, and quivered. In this slow 
instant, he now understood&#151;he understood everything. And not only did he 
come to understand everything he quested for, but in fact everything 
that had ever existed, from the beginning until now, until it all 
overwhelmed him and pushed him over the edge.

&quot;My God,&quot; he whispered, bleeding and gaping in amazement. &quot;I understand 
now. I see. I can really see. Yes. Yes. This is a marvelous gift.&quot; The 
man in white smiled softly.

&quot;Caleb, Son of the First-Father, what is it you seek?&quot; There was only 
one thing the Scion wished for, above all else, and he spoke her name 
without hesitation.

&quot;I want my Venus.&quot;

&quot;Then you shall have her, for all men find what they truly seek.&quot; He 
gestured behind Malchior, and as the Scion turned, his ancient stone 
heart dared to leap again as he beheld the woman who had once saved his 
soul, and taught him to love. She was not beautiful by mortal 
standards&#151;she still had that scarred face of hers that marked her as an 
outcast&#151;but to Malchior, she was more real and more wonderful than 
anything. And she was really real; he could feel her as they embraced, 
and could smell her sweet earthy scent, and hear her timid voice.

&quot;Caleb,&quot; she said, &quot;I am here.&quot;

&quot;Venus!&quot; he exclaimed, squeezing his one good eye shut in happiness. He 
held her close enough to feel her pulse, and wept for joy. &quot;Venus, 
Venus&#151;oh, my Venus, my Venus!&quot;

And Malchior&#39;s body burst open, releasing his soul.

It was finished.

Thirteen suddenly jerked aside, his glimmering white aura fading as 
overwhelming surprise struck him. No, it wasn&#39;t finished&#151;he could sense 
Pale!

And...something else. Something powerful. Something that even made him 
concerned.

With all speed, he took off, nothing clouding his thoughts save the 
retrieval of the fallen angel.

.........

Even with the war still raging around them, the group paused to mourn 
the loss of Captain Amazing&#151;a man who, even at the very end, deserved 
that title. The surviving members of the Savage Six were especially 
weepy, and not a dry eye was among them. Priest performed the rites of 
passage, praying for the safety of his leader&#39;s soul, and those who 
loved the elderly man hung their heads and clasped the hands of their 
loved ones, sacrificing a few minutes to pay their respects.

&quot;We must go,&quot; said Setsuka, her voice sounding distant. &quot;I sense that 
our strange accomplice has made contact with Malchior. Soon we will have 
little to worry about except the rabble still clinging to life here. It 
will be good to finally have this war over with.&quot;

&quot;The war is not over yet,&quot; murmured Alicia eerily. A few people looked 
to their silent comrade, but soon all mysteries were moot as a Something 
erupted overhead, like the sound of the mightiest titan shrieking in 
unbearable agony. Everyone knew the sound&#151;they had experienced it 
before, on the very eve of the battle, and with it too came the unusual 
chill that overcame the land. Now, the mighty scream was back, so 
powerful that it broke glass; the following cold sent shivers up even 
the mightiest spines.

&quot;The hell?&quot; whispered Pandora.

&quot;That was the sound made by a demon so ancient and powerful, it precedes 
this very world and strikes fear into the hearts of angels.&quot; Everyone 
jerked back to Alicia, and froze as they noticed she was standing&#151;and 
glowing&#151;and had sprouted great shimmering black wings. It was Pale.

&quot;Pale?&quot; whispered Stalker, who had not seen the angel in awhile. Pale 
spoke again, but not to anyone in particular.

&quot;This monster was unearthed when Malchior called forth his undead&#151;an 
entity borne from the union between Sin and the Enemy, the chancellor of 
Pandemonium and the herald of the world&#39;s end. It is The Dragon.&quot;

&quot;The Dragon?&quot; Whispers abounded, and many people shuddered just from 
hearing Pale&#39;s otherworldly description. She nodded quietly, crossing 
her arms in fear.

&quot;It is here,&quot; she murmured. &quot;A force this powerful is beyond the 
reckoning of every living creature.&quot; And with a mighty shout she 
proclaimed, &quot;GET OUT OF THE CITY, NOW!!!&quot; Nobody wanted to argue with 
her in that state, so they made for the nearest border with all speed, a 
black shadow above them, growing ever closer. The chill was now brutal: 
ice and snow formed on the ground in moments, as if the monster&#39;s very 
presence stole the warmth of the sun. The team was nearly to the end of 
the city after such a maniacal sprint...

And then, IT was upon them. Lovers of fantasy stories and films thought 
that The Dragon would be the standard oversized lizard-creature with 
wings, belching fire and death. Yet this Dragon was nothing like them: 
its sheer size was incredible, easily dwarfing most mountains. Its head 
was really more like a turkey&#39;s, wrinkled and savage, and it had the 
short beak too, but its eyes were demon&#39;s, nothing else. Its entire body 
was covered with long, fine quills, making it resemble a porcupine, but 
its wings were sheer bone, no flesh to give them integrity. The limbs it 
had were like salamander&#39;s feet; the tail looked like it belonged on a 
horse, each hair a razor-sharp piece of wire. Its very presence was 
nauseating, and Pale stood forth to fight it.

&quot;Stay back, all of you!&quot; she bade, restraining them with her arm. &quot;I am 
the only one who can fight this monstrosity! Demon,&quot; she addressed it in 
a strong voice, &quot;even though I am fallen, I command you in the name of 
almighty Kurios to crawl back into the infernal abyss! Heed my orders, 
or else I will take you apart!&quot; The monster replied with another of its 
freezing roars.

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to cooperate, honey,&quot; muttered Stalker. Pale 
ignored her; instead, she prepared for the inevitable battle. Her black 
wings tripled in size, and the bleak aura around her exploded into a 
wide shimmering radius, making it look like she was on heavenly fire. A 
sword erupted from her hand&#151;not a material being, but something alive 
and organic, rushing with energy. The Dragon spread its skeletal wings 
to meet the challenge, and shot one of its scaly limbs out to crush the 
puny glowing thing before it.

Pale&#39;s true power came to bear, surprising even Amielle. The little 
angel moved faster than a jet, creating ear-splitting sonic booms as she 
ground into the monster&#39;s needle-flesh, carving her sword deep inside. 
She flew over its body, smooth as a raging river, her sword ripping and 
shredding effortlessly&#151;but the monster didn&#39;t even seem bothered. Its 
needles stood on end and actually bent and twisted like snakes to stab 
Pale, some coming very close, others impaling The Dragon&#39;s own body. 
Pale swerved and looped through the torrent with everything she had, 
using her shimmering blade to slice through the needles on her way to 
the creature&#39;s neck.

She jerked to a halt and swung with all her might. This time The 
Dragon&#39;s reaction was as expected&#151;it screamed in pain, but shed no 
blood. Its long, reddish head swirled around and chased after Pale, the 
neck continuing to extend well past its original size. It vomited fire 
from its small mouth, and now along with the mindlessly jabbing needles, 
its tail joined the attack, lashing its thousands of whips after the 
angel. Pale flew directly into the storm and whirled her sword like a 
tornado, slicing off the razor-sharp wires faster than the eye could 
see. Emerging from the storm with a few small cuts, she soared high into 
the air, looped around, and dove back to The Dragon for a second attack. 
But the monster&#39;s long head followed her, even at that height; she 
paused in midair to regard this unholy sight.

&quot;Good Lord,&quot; whispered Xianq, clutching her boyfriend&#39;s hand tightly. 
The Dragon&#39;s body was still earthbound, but its wings slowly stretched 
upward, reaching out to claw Pale from the sky. The head and neck itself 
was as long as a skyscraper now; all of time seemed to freeze in this 
moment. Pale glared at The Dragon; the Monster of all monsters lurched 
forward, its mouth opening wider than anyone thought possible. Pale fell 
backwards, towards the body, spiraling wildly like a shooting star. The 
skeletal wings were nearing her; she swung at them on the way down, 
getting nicked here and there as the bony shrapnel fell. She plunged 
herself into the field of needles waiting for her below, and came 
bursting out the other end, sending entrails flying everywhere.

Every weapon The Dragon had at its disposal was now going after Pale: 
grubby stubby legs and arms slapping, needles jabbing, the razor-tale 
lashing, the bony wings swatting, and now the head was pursuing her, 
spitting balls of fire that Pale sliced through as she flew her way 
around her enemy, slicing as she saw fit. The sheer mass of the 
abomination meant that Pale would need to do more than cut it apart to 
kill it, but so far she was doing fine, staying one step ahead of the 
beast. Of course, even the luck of angels runs out: The Dragon finally 
caught her in its jaws and swallowed her whole, shocking everyone.

&quot;Pale!!&quot; Amielle stared in horror as her beloved became a snack, and 
without hesitation, she drew her own blade. But her concern was 
unnecessary: no sooner did The Dragon sigh in contentment and turn 
around to leer at the spectators, Pale erupted right out of its body, 
sending a massive explosion of luminescence radiating outwards, blowing 
the monster apart from within. The creature&#39;s body flew to pieces, and 
soon the blast evaporated those pieces, just so a messy carcass wouldn&#39;t 
be strewn all over the city.

&quot;Pale!!&quot; Amielle was the first at her side; the angel had fallen soon 
after the big bang, and now laid on the ground, smoke rising from her 
body. As Amielle knelt down to cradle the love of her life, she drew in 
a breath of surprise&#151;Pale had somehow reverted back to Alicia! &quot;Alicia?&quot; 
she whispered. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Alicia Moore stirred, feeling as if her 
entire body was both numb and awash with flame. She managed to smile at 
her love and took her hand.

&quot;It took...a lot out of us. Just let us rest, Amielle...&quot; She fainted 
quietly, concerning her lover for a brief moment. Cobra came by and 
checked the girl, and concluded that she was just incredibly weary and 
in need of a good long rest. They all were.

&quot;There&#39;s still a lot to do,&quot; said Priest, dusting himself off. &quot;We have 
Malchior and the remnants of the armies to drive away. I suggest we let 
Stalker take care of Alicia, while the rest of us split up and&#151;&quot;

&quot;There is no need to go after the Dark Scion,&quot; spoke a very familiar 
voice. Everyone knew who it was, but they still didn&#39;t like it. Amielle 
glared at him.

&quot;Why not? Did you kill him?&quot;

&quot;I only gave him what he wanted,&quot; answered Thirteen. &quot;His soul is now 
eternally at rest. So that is why there is no need to go after him. I 
sensed that Pale was in this area, so I came over to investigate. I can 
feel her presence if I am close enough to her. Tell me, where is she 
hidden?&quot; He looked and smiled directly at Amielle, as if he expected the 
girl to tell him everything. She just bristled and spat on his foot.

&quot;Really, dear,&quot; he sighed, &quot;there is no need for that.&quot; Suddenly, one of 
the stray zombies lurched out and clamped its teeth on Mr. White&#39;s arm, 
freezing for a second as its victim regarded this new change. 
&quot;Nuisance,&quot; he muttered&#151;and just like that, the zombie disintegrated. 
The man in white looked around, noticing Malchior&#39;s &quot;release&quot; had not 
quite killed them all off, and sighed wearily. &quot;I suppose I shall have 
to earn my keep after all,&quot; he said, extending his arms. A rush of 
bluish-white mist, looking much like a river, came flowing out from his 
body, sweeping towards the legions of undead where they all were 
destroyed instantly. The organic beings moaned as the river touched 
them, but aside from a few who ran for cover, nothing happened to them.

&quot;You bastard!&quot; exclaimed an outraged Rin. &quot;Why the hell didn&#39;t you do 
that before?!&quot;

&quot;Because the Dark Scion was still in existence,&quot; he answered smoothly. 
&quot;Wiping out the undead before their creator was eliminated would be a 
waste of my efforts.&quot;

&quot;Then why didn&#39;t you kill that guy earlier?&quot;

&quot;That is a question I refuse to answer,&quot; he said, grinning giddily. Rin 
roared, and probably would&#39;ve smacked him around if Snowblood, Ferret, 
Kailin, and Kathy hadn&#39;t held her back (it took all their strength 
combined to restrain her).

&quot;Let it go, Rin,&quot; Setsuka whispered, taking her beloved&#39;s hand 
soothingly. &quot;Let it go. What&#39;s done is done. The fact of the matter is 
that our job&#39;s a lot easier. Let&#39;s focus on driving back the remnants, 
then this whole thing will be over.&quot; Rin slowly became steady, looked 
Setsuka in the eye, and nodded quietly.

......

It did not take them long to finish off the remaining pockets of evil. 
With the undead gone, it was a matter of driving back or destroying the 
living, and many of these fled once they realized their undead allies 
were lost forever. Those who resisted were wiped clean, but the cost of 
complete peace was severe. Lady Wonder was at last taken down when one 
of the more persistent villains shot a harpoon through her, and Morpheus 
was overwhelmed by countless enemies immune to his sleeping-spells. That 
three members of the Savage Six could perish in such a short time, 
regardless of their age, was startling. Priest walked off to be alone, 
looking inconsolable. Paradox knelt down and embraced the body of Lady 
Wonder, weeping uncontrollably. The Shift merely stood, staring quietly 
at Morpheus.

&quot;Farewell, my brother,&quot; he whispered. The man of a thousand looks knelt 
down and kissed the forehead of the King of Dreams, whispering a prayer 
that only he could hear. The others stood by, their victory feeling 
empty. The age of the old heroes was nearly over, along with the day. 
The sky was orange and pink with weeping.

&quot;If everything here is finished, we should return to headquarters and 
take a few days to rest,&quot; Mora said. &quot;Let&#39;s concentrate on our next move 
after that. Right now I&#39;m too exhausted to think of anything else but a 
warm bed and a hot bath.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that our vacation will be cut short,&quot; said the unmistakable 
clipped voice of Yohko Kamaguchi, limping slightly as she crossed the 
ruined city. Only Pandora and Pochanski knew where she had been and what 
had happened, but suffice to say that everyone was glad for her absence. 
But now, the look on her face...

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I mean we&#39;ll find a most unpleasant surprise in store for us when we 
get back,&quot; she stated, shutting her cell phone. &quot;MERCS headquarters has 
been taken over by the remnants of the Dead Zodiac. They invaded while 
we were busy here.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding!&quot; Pandora snarled, balling her fists up in 
rage. Yohko shook her head.

&quot;No, I just spoke to Yui. Frankly I&#39;m amazed the Zodiac weren&#39;t able to 
stop her from sending that transmission, but I guess she got lucky. In 
any case, it seems we have another big fight ahead of us.&quot;

&quot;...Just great.&quot; Pandora grumbled and marched off, still nursing all her 
old wounds. First this three-day war, and now the Dead Zodiac&#151;most of 
whom she had avoided fighting. Now she had to team up with these freaks, 
again, and take back the headquarters before...

&quot;Oh my god,&quot; she murmured, dark thoughts entering her mind. She whirled 
around and gave Kamaguchi a chilling glare. &quot;Yohko... My god, Yohko, 
what if they find your secrets?&quot;

&quot;I considered that,&quot; said the doctor, still sounding calm. &quot;I managed to 
secure them, but who knows how long they&#39;ll be safe?&quot;

&quot;Wait a minute, what secrets?&quot; asked Namie.

&quot;I thought I told everybody,&quot; Yohko gestured. &quot;Remember how I said I was 
involved with experiments regarding many of your number? Naturally, as a 
scientist, I kept the records of those experiments and even some 
physical data I collected. If those secrets should fall into the wrong 
hands&#151;and we must all admit that the Dead Zodiac constitute as thus&#151;then 
the catastrophe that would follow would be unimaginable.&quot;

For the longest time, everyone was silent as they let this final tidbit 
sink in.

Lady Luck summed it all up fairly well.

&quot;Guys, I have a bad feeling about this.&quot;

The End of Part Six Epilogue

As I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a 
loud voice: &quot;Woe! Woe! Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, because of 
the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels!&quot;
