~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Holy Basilica of the Fallen Ones, Island of Creation

Clash! 

Clash went the swords of Wind Soul and Fire Cutter. Aarin and Setsuya 
collided along with them. The Final Match of Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou 
went by for a longer length of time than either of them could have 
imagined possible. For the better half of an hour, Setsuya Seisuji and 
Aarin Highland did their absolute best to outdo each other. Their skills 
were so well honed and yet so tightly matched. What Setsuya had in 
strength, Aarin made up for in speed. Aarin&#39;s vigour as a tactician was 
countered by Setsuya&#39;s raw endurance. And as the battle wore on it 
became obvious that they were almost complete equals. The Holy Basilica 
of the Fallen Ones could hardly contain the raging superpowers of the 
Yuuga School. The rafters from up above were falling down from the stray 
bolts of power that were released after the Fire Cutter collided with 
the Wind Soul. The flames from the constant Fire attacks burned across 
the floorboards of the church, which itself had been battered from the 
fight. One of the stain glass windows to the far side of the church had 
been blown open. The few crosses and memorabilia left from the time at 
which this was an establishment of the Christian Church had been 
destroyed. Nothing was left of the Basilica but a battered hall filled 
with fire and wind. 

Setsuya and Aarin ran towards each other from either side of the hall 
and locked swords once more. The two forces planted more and more energy 
into the fight. Energy that they really didn&#39;t have to spare. Both grit 
their bared teeth at the other. Their veins throbbed violently from the 
constant flow of blood to accommodate their consistently forceful use of 
their bodies. Sweat ran down their faces and dripped over their clothes. 
Sweat that was generated both from physical exertion and the searing 
heat of the fire that was surrounding them. The grey clouds of smoke 
kept growing in there. It made their eyes water and made it harder for 
either of them to see what was happening around them. Such were the 
effects of the Sacred Swords when wielded by two fighters who were 
worthy. Fierce twin growls escaped the throats of both fighters as their 
strained to beat the other in the weapon lock. Setsuya&#39;s dark marble 
eyes stared down with Aarin&#39;s naturally lighter ones. Streaks of 
friction slid up and down both Fire Cutter and Wind Soul from the point 
of connection. They both braced themselves on the blackening ground 
whilst straining to overpower the other. 

Setsuya strained to speak, through his tiredness, the smoke and the 
heat. &quot;...Looks like... you and me are... pretty even... huh...?&quot;

&quot;...S-Seems so...&quot; Aarin had an equally hard time speaking, &quot;...How are 
we... going to... settle this... then...?&quot;

&quot;One shot... deal...&quot; The Japanese youth responded, &quot;Your best magic... 
versus... my best magic... sound good...?&quot;

Aarin nodded. &quot;...Deal...&quot;

The two Yuuga fighters remained as they were for one last second, before 
separating from each other. Setsuya and Aarin jumped back from their 
sword lock to separate and distant positions from the other. Setsuya&#39;s 
brown boots landed on the ground with a thump; the tip of the Fire 
Cutter hitting the ground with clash. It was now that he was starting to 
see how much his battle had effected the Holy Basilica. It was falling 
apart. In fact it would probably burn down in about half and hour. They 
had to finish their fight and get out of this place before they burned 
down with it. Setsuya leaned upwards into a standing position. His best 
magic was his best shot at taking down Aarin. He just had to hope that 
Aarin&#39;s best magic wouldn&#39;t overwhelm it. So Setsuya stood perfectly 
upright and blocked out all the fire and destruction that was taking 
place around him. His eyes slipped shut and his heartbeat sped up. 
Concentrating this level of magical force was never an easy thing to 
accomplish. Especially when the magical force itself was based on the 
weapon rather than the person conjuring it. The Japanese youth dragged 
his sword arm up with the Fire Cutter in hand. He levelled it out until 
it was even with the line of his face. Setsuya gripped the bottom part 
of the hilt with the free hand and stood in that position. With his eyes 
still closed, Setsuya took deep breaths and waited for the signal to 
come. That palpable signal of readiness. While doing this; runic symbols 
appeared on the blade of the Fire Cutter. Similar to the ones that were 
cut into the blade of the Shadow Edge sword. But these were born of fire 
and their true language still remained unknown. Steam also leaked from 
the Fire Cutter. It rose into the air and dissipated. A reflection of 
the heat that was being generated from the Fire Cutter sword. 

Aarin took note of Setsuya&#39;s actions from across the Holy Basilica. His 
rival was gathering up more and more force for the following magical 
attack. Not that Aarin wasn&#39;t doing the same. The Highland Family Heir&#39;s 
sword was heaved into the air in the same way it was for Setsuya; in 
front of the body. But Aarin&#39;s handling of the Wind Soul came at a 
vertical pose as opposed to Setsuya&#39;s horizontal positioning of Fire 
Cutter. In the same length of time a set of runic symbols appeared at 
the blade of the Wind Soul. But those runes were white in colour with 
difference to the Fire Cutter&#39;s flame orange. A pure white wind soon 
began to circle Aarin&#39;s body from the base of his boots. It curled 
around his form like a miniature gale. His platinum blonde hair rose 
into the air as the sword-made gusts enfolded him. This was the power of 
the Wind Soul as it began to unlock for the first time. The same 
happened for Setsuya. A wave of dragon-shape rotated around and around 
the young man&#39;s body at a short distance. But close enough to cast its 
glow over him. Twin shots of indication passed through both Setsuya and 
Aarin at roughly the same time. The feeling that meant their attacks 
were ready. Setsuya opened his eyes and looked over at Aarin. He kept 
his position as the symbols over the Fire Cutter began to brighten and 
the heat in that room took on a fever pitch. 

The time was now. &quot;Inferno Phoenix!&quot;

A shriek of a great bird sounded out around the echoing, flame-infested 
hall of the Holy Basilica. A huge wave of fire surged up from behind the 
poised Setsuya. That fire took on a shape that mirrored the body and 
glory of the Phoenix. The legendary bird that rose from the ashes. It 
spread out its flaming wingspan and shrieked from its burning beak again 
as a call of intent. The Inferno Phoenix rose up and flew straight at 
Aarin. The Englishman looked on at the great bird of fire. His own 
counter to it was prepared for action. The wind that bellowed loudly 
around Aarin grew even stronger than it had been before. And a huge 
twirling cyclone thrust through the air from his sword. The stained 
glass windows at the sides of the hall all burst open and shattered from 
the merciless potency of the wind as that twirling wind took on its own 
form. A vortex of swirling force that could have protected Aarin from 
God herself. 

&quot;Hurricane!&quot;

The Inferno Phoenix used its beautiful fiery wings to plunge itself head 
first into the blustery tempest of the Hurricane Attack. There was a 
gigantic burst of strength at the very instance that the two attacked 
rammed into each other. The flames and smoke that filled the church were 
all blown back by the waving shockwave of power that pushed outwards 
from the impact. The purifying fire of the Inferno Phoenix and the and 
savage wind of the Hurricane consumed and swallowed each other up in a 
brutal haze of destruction. Both Aarin and Setsuya fought a personal 
battle to stand their ground from the vast energy that was released from 
their attack magic collision. The whole of the Holy Basilica shook from 
the power of the two attacks. The noise from inside it was enough to be 
heard from across the outer gardens and forests. The floorboards beneath 
the two fighters began to crack from the strain of the power. It broke 
in sections and the wooden planks began to sink into themselves. The 
stone that made up the walls of the church shook fervently until they 
also began to crack. Loose stone fell to the floors of the Holy 
Basilica. And what little unbroken glass left soon cracked and shattered 
along with the rest. 

Then things fell quiet. 

The brutal force of the conflict began to fade. The attacks died down 
and faded away. The rocks that had been tossed into the air now started 
falling back down on the battered floor. That loud shaking that had 
overtaken the church suddenly stopped. Those flames born of the Fire 
Cutter were blown out like candles by the vibrant intensity of the 
double attack. All that was left was the quietness that comes at the end 
of destruction. That, and the two fighters whom had cast the magical 
super attacks. Setsuya and Aarin. 

Setsuya was on his knees, using his sword staked into the ground as 
leverage. It propped him up. But his thoughts were on Aarin. &quot;He... 
blocked the Inferno Phoenix.&quot;

And though Aarin was still standing, he looked far more tired. &quot;...I 
managed to defend myself against Setsuya&#39;s attack... but I couldn&#39;t 
overpower it...&quot;

From this, Aarin looked upwards. Over at Setsuya, across the burnt black 
floorboards of the Holy Basilica. Setsuya was now getting back onto his 
feet. It was a slow process for him but he was ready to get up and 
resume the fight. And Aarin felt as though he were ready to collapse. 
That was the one thing that made Setsuya stronger than he was. Tenacity. 
Setsuya wouldn&#39;t give up on a fight until he was cold and dead. Now that 
he had the Chinese girl Lin-Lin to protect, Setsuya had a great impetus 
to win. More so that Aarin. And that was Aarin&#39;s true failure as a 
warrior. For so long he had felt that he had no purpose as a fighter. 
Now he had found one. To protect his family. But without Setsuya&#39;s blind 
and courageous drive, Aarin would always be behind him. Not that was it 
was a horrible place to be. If Aarin&#39;s sword-skills had to be inferior 
to anyone&#39;s he would have wanted it to be Setsuya&#39;s. 

He was the one.

Aarin smiled, almost sadly, but there was great joy in his heart. 
&quot;...You win, my friend.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Setsuya lowered his sword arm, &quot;You mean... you concede?&quot;

Aarin nodded. &quot;Yes. It was a good fight. I&#39;m glad that I got the chance 
to test out my new powers against you. But I can see who the strongest 
is. Even if you yourself can&#39;t quite see it yet. Besides. You need to 
save your strength. The Tournament isn&#39;t over just yet.&quot;

Setsuya was so consumed with the idea that he won the tournament, that 
he forgot about what had been told to them when they first came here. 
That the winner of the final round would face the man Zephaniah in a 
bonus match. This fight would probably take place tomorrow. Once that 
battle was over they would be forced to leave the Island of Creation. 
But he had to find Lin-Lin before then.

&quot;...Lin-Lin...&quot; Setsuya mumbled to himself, &quot;I gotta save her before... 
but when will I have the time to find her? Chizuru gave me a map but I 
can&#39;t search for her tonight. And as soon as tomorrow&#39;s fight is 
concluded we&#39;ll have to leave the Island.&quot;

Aarin shook his head. &quot;Don&#39;t be so... ridiculous. You go and fight that 
Zephaniah man. He is the leader of the Shougatsu Financial Group and is 
probably the root of our problems. And while you do that; Ingrid and I 
will search for her.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d really do that for me?&quot; Setsuya said, puzzled.

&quot;Of course,&quot; The Englishman slowly sheathed Wind Soul, &quot;The last time I 
checked; we are friends, are we not? Consider it payback for giving me 
the challenge I&#39;ve been searching for these past two years.&quot;

And so Setsuya gave his smile of thanks. &quot;...I can always count on you, 
Highland.&quot;

Sugano Warehouse, Kuji, Neo-Japan

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything until now?&quot;

It might not have been the best place to make love, but, Sugano 
Warehouse seemed like the only safe place for Ayame and Julia this time. 
The two huddled against each other under the security of the thin 
blanket that Ayame had brought with them. Their clothes were rested in 
two small piles, Julia&#39;s one a little neater than Ayame&#39;s, but there was 
no really time for any of that when two people physically express their 
affection for each other. Ayame gave a peaceful sigh as Julia rested her 
head upon her shoulder. Her strong arms were wrapped tightly around the 
slightly older woman, so pleased with what had happened. 

Julia smiled to herself, locking hands with her protector. &quot;...I wanted 
to tell you. I really did. But things kept getting in the way. Somehow 
my Dad found out about how I felt about you, and he kept pressuring me 
to be honest, but the more he talked about happiness, the more I thought 
it was a bad idea.&quot;

Ayame shook her head. &quot;Why would it have been a bad idea?&quot;

&quot;Because Daddy and I intended to go home,&quot; Julia answered, &quot;If I told 
you how I felt before I left and something came of it... you know that 
it would have hurt a lot more to leave you. And there was always the 
chance that you didn&#39;t feel the same way. I mean... I catch you staring 
at me sometimes, but that doesn&#39;t really mean much, does it?&quot;

The Neo-Japanese woman coughed into her fist. &quot;...Um... you noticed 
that, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yep!&quot; Not that she minded. Julia leaned up and gave a quick kiss to 
Ayame, &quot;But I&#39;m very flattered in any case. I can&#39;t imagine what you see 
in me.&quot;

&quot;Well for starters, you&#39;re everything I&#39;ve ever wanted in a woman,&quot; She 
said, &quot;But one thing still bothers me. If you were so hesitant to tell 
me before, why did you do it now?&quot;

Then Julia tightened up a bit. And Ayame had known Julia long enough to 
know what that meant. She was hiding something. But before long she put 
this feeling to light. &quot;...You&#39;re going to dismiss it as a crazy idea, I 
just know it.&quot;

&quot;Come on, spill it,&quot; Ayame goaded, &quot;I wanna know.&quot;

And so she did. &quot;...I was thinking... why don&#39;t you come with me?&quot;

Ayame blinked. &quot;To where?&quot;

&quot;To Scotland, of course,&quot; The Brit replied, &quot;With me. Think about it. 
You could end this mission thing you have as the Dark Katana. You&#39;d 
never have to be in danger again. I know that Scotland might not be the 
most fancy place out there; after all they didn&#39;t even make a Safe Zone 
out of it. But we could make it work. And we know that we mean more to 
each other now. Could you really throw that way after I leave?&quot;

This was all a bit sudden. She accepted that she would have to see Julia 
leave her at some point. If she went with Julia to her homeland then 
they would not have to say goodbye. But Scotland was all the way across 
the world... &quot;...Julia... Neo-Japan is my home... I grew up here... and 
it&#39;s where I feel most comfortable... do you really think I can just 
pack up and say goodbye to it?&quot;

Julia looked up at Ayame with those pleading green puppy dog eyes of 
hers. &quot;I know I&#39;m asking a lot of you. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t want to say 
anything. But I really think that we could make it work. I&#39;d stay in 
Neo-Japan if I could, but you know that I&#39;d never be safe here. But I 
can&#39;t bare to leave you either.&quot;

She did raise convincing arguments. And to be honest, there was very 
little that was keeping Ayame in this country other than the fact that 
it was her place of birth. Maybe it wasn&#39;t as farfetched as it seemed. 
Maybe she actually could start a new life with Julia in Scotland. 

The smile on the face of the Dark Katana brightened. &quot;...I guess I&#39;ll 
come along for the ride then. Who knows, I might find life even better 
in the west?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Ayame!&quot; The brown-haired woman wrapped her arms around Ayame&#39;s neck 
and giggled childishly, &quot;You won&#39;t regret this! I&#39;m going to make you so 
happy, I swear it!&quot;

&quot;However...&quot; And Julia pulled back a little as Ayame said this, &quot;If I&#39;m 
going to your country then Megumi&#39;s coming with me.&quot;

And suddenly Julia&#39;s smile caved in again, eyes narrowing. &quot;...And just 
who is Megumi?&quot;

Ayame took one long look at Julia before bursting out with laughter. 
&quot;...Ah, ha, ha, ha! Oh man, are you actually JEALOUS!? How soon we all 
forget things, eh? Megumi&#39;s my bike! The one we rode through Nagoya on! 
Remember?&quot;

Now Julia was suddenly feeling a little embarrassed. Blushing, she ran a 
hand through her lengthy locks of chestnut hair. &quot;...Oh... I&#39;m sorry... 
I don&#39;t mean to sound so possessive...&quot;

But Ayame didn&#39;t begrudge it. Though Julia was a year older than Ayame 
was, there was a cluster of immaturity beneath all her kindness and 
intelligence. But far from being a sort of detriment to her overall 
personality, it actually enhanced it. &quot;Nah, it&#39;s cute. It&#39;s very cute. I 
like a woman who can get a little jealous sometimes. Don&#39;t worry about 
it. However, as much as I&#39;d love to stay here and talk, I think we 
should get something to eat. How about it?&quot;

Julia nodded cheerfully to that. &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Diana&#39;s Room, Neuschwanstein Castle, Island of Creation

&quot;Won&#39;t you please stop crying? I did what I thought was best for you.&quot;

It had been over two days since Diana&#39;s revival. And Zephaniah had made 
no headway with her. She was just as engaged and distant as before. The 
girl had not eaten since she had been awakened nor had she washed or 
taken the time to change her clothes. All she did was weep into the 
pillow of her bed in her lavishly decorated room. To be honest with it 
all; Zephaniah was losing patience. He would be fighting tomorrow 
against whichever fighter who had won the tournament in today&#39;s final 
match. He should have been preparing for that with the love of his 
intended bride to be alongside of him. But she would barely go anywhere 
near him. What did this all mean? Had Zephaniah made an error by 
bringing Diana back to life as a Deity? 

The young woman sobbed into her pillow. But managed to look ahead of her 
when she realized what Zephaniah had just said to her. &#39;I did what I 
thought was best for you&#39;. Diana could not contain the anger she felt in 
her heart from hearing something like that. She turned around over to 
her back, lying on the bed. And while Zephaniah was expecting her to 
show a little bit of compassion towards him; he was greeted with a cold 
stare of absolute disgust. 

&quot;Best?!&quot; Diana&#39;s voice was breaking from all her crying, &quot;You think that 
what you&#39;ve done is what&#39;s best for me? Have you even stopped to look at 
me?! You&#39;ve made me into an abomination! A construct in a laboratory! Am 
I even human anymore? Am I even the same Diana you once knew?!&quot;

Zephaniah lowered his eyes. &quot;You are in perfect condition. Nothing about 
you looks even vaguely inhuman. You will always be the same Diana. But 
you are not human anymore. Do not see this as a appalling thing. You are 
now something that is better than a human being. You&#39;ve become a Deity. 
You can live forever now. You will never age, or become sickly. You are 
at my side once more. I did this all for you.&quot;

&quot;You did this for yourself, Aesus!&quot; Diana barked, &quot;You did it so that 
you would not feel the pain of loss! You did not stop to think for one 
second how something like this would effect me! Don&#39;t you understand 
what you&#39;ve done!?&quot;

&quot;I have allowed us a second chance.&quot;

Diana&#39;s beautiful, tear-stained face scowled at him. &quot;No! You have 
played games with life! I do not condone what those thugs did to me on 
that day! I don&#39;t welcome it! I resent it! But God decided that my day 
to depart was then! You cannot reverse the cycle of life and spin it in 
your favour! God will punish you for these actions! They are blasphemy!&quot;

But Diana was silenced with a thick growl from the Great Knight. He 
swung his mighty fist around and slammed it into the wall in anger. One 
of the landscape paintings that had been hung up over the wall was 
knocked off it and crashed down into the vanity unit that had been 
positioned below it.

Such was the anger of Zephaniah. &quot;Well if God has a problem with my 
actions then I will vanquish him! He forsook his fife the day that the 
Genesis Comet bombarded this planet! In such times of destruction we of 
earthly birth make our own choices and shape our own destiny! No one 
orders me anymore! I answer to the whims of no one but myself! If you 
would only see this from my point of view then you would know that what 
I did was the correct action! You must trust me!&quot;

&quot;Trust you?!&quot; Diana swung her arm around her in her anger. But while she 
did this, a flash of light broke from her hand and blasted the far wall. 
She froze in action and looked down at her hand. Had she just done that? 
&quot;...W-What on Earth...?&quot;

&quot;Just one of the new powers you possess,&quot; Zephaniah filled in the 
blanks, &quot;The power of Light Magic. You are imbued with the power of 
magic now. Your wounds will heal with the speed of lightning. You are 
the first of a great new race. Join me at my side, Diana. It can be 
better than it was before. If you will only trust me...?&quot;

&quot;How can I trust you... after what you have done to me...?&quot; Diana said, 
sadly. 

Zephaniah sighed. &quot;I made you better than you once were.&quot;

&quot;I am no longer human!&quot; The woman retorted, &quot;Do you honestly believe 
that I would thank you for taking away my humanity, Aesus!?&quot;

&quot;Humanity is weak. And I am not Aesus,&quot; Said the Great Knight, &quot;Not 
anymore. We have changed, you and I. But if you open your eyes then you 
will see that these changes are for the better. With you at my side we 
can carry out Second Origin together and purge the world of evil. The 
evils born out of this frightened thing you regard as mankind.&quot;

Diana gave him an honest glimpse. &quot;What of the people who are not evil? 
Those who are not guilty of sin? What of them? Will they die along with 
the rest in your ambitions? Do you not see the folly in this? You seek 
to replicate the malevolence that others committed against us. But this 
time the whole world is your enemy. Do you honestly intend to make 
people suffer as much as we have...?&quot;

The dark-haired man crossed his arms. &quot;It is no more than they deserve.&quot;

&quot;...Words will not sway you from this course of action you have set for 
yourself, will they? Nothing I say will change your mind. You have fixed 
yourself on this sacrilegious plan of yours. There is nothing more I can 
say. You&#39;ve forsaken yourself.&quot;

There was a probing question in Zephaniah&#39;s mind. &quot;...And forsaken your 
love for me?&quot;

&quot;How dare you?&quot; Diana shot back, staring honestly at the slightly older 
man, &quot;You know as well as I do that my love is unchanged. I would have 
given anything to see you once again. But you are no longer the same 
man. Not the man I fell in love with. What happened to those caring and 
compassionate eyes of yours? Why have they grown so cold and harsh?&quot;

&quot;Those eyes were awoken when they saw the hopeless reality of life,&quot; 
Zephaniah glimpsed downwards again, but turned around towards the door. 
Things were not going as planned with concern to Diana. But his Second 
Origin would continue, &quot;The despicable iniquities of humankind that 
plague this Earth will be eradicated without fail. Second Origin will 
begin tomorrow when I finally capture the Four Sacred Swords. I want you 
at my side, Diana. So we can build a better world for ourselves. And 
while I know that your revitalization has come as a great shock, you 
will come around to my way of thinking. In all due time.&quot; 

With that, Zephaniah left the room. Leaving Diana behind to contemplate 
her choices. On one hand she had the man she loved. But on the other, he 
was fast becoming a malicious oppressor bent on the ruin of humanity as 
she knew it. How could she bind herself to a man who would even think of 
such things? How could she turn away from him?

...What could she do?
