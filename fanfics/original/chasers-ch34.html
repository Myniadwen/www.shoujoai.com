<a href="../original/chasers-ch33.html">Back to Part 33</a><pre>&quot;All humans and androids are brothers!&quot; the young
woman cried out, frantically waving around the sign.

Using a throat-mic another man projected his voice
right across the courtyard to say, &quot;Androids are
people, too!&quot;

&quot;Free the Okuda four!&quot; was a statement that repeated,
too.

Colonel Amanda Davidson of the Japan Self Defense
Corps turned away from the window with a amused smile,
her short blonde hair falling into her blue eyes.
Looking over the group she asked, &quot;The Okuda four?&quot;

&quot;A group of protesters that were arrested trying to
shut down an android research facility,&quot; Dr. Richard
Davis answered her, grey hair tied back loosely, &quot;the
people down there argue that the research involved was
illegal.&quot;

&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting,&quot; Mr. Alexander said
sheepishly, the representative of Nu-tech loking more
than a bit stressed as he entered the meeting room, &quot;I
had another meeting.&quot; He was oddly rumpled looking for
an executive, and quite strangely his nose looked like
it had been broken recently.

The Commisoner looked tired from where he sat at the
head of the table, as if he had been awake for most of
the night. &quot;All right,&quot; Nicholas looked around with a
sigh, &quot;now that most of the major players are here,
let&#39;s talk.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still a little confused Gwen wasn&#39;t invited,&quot;
Richard scowled.

&quot;Officially I don&#39;t want the Chasers involved with
this meeting,&quot; the Colonel said crisply, &quot;especially
with the leaks we&#39;ve been having.&quot;

&quot;You suspect a member of the Chasers?&quot; Nicholas asked
neutrally.

&quot;No way to know,&quot; Amanda answered, &quot;from what I
understand the crackdown information was released to
too many people to accurately determine who leaked
it.&quot;

&quot;And Gwen not here to defend them,&quot; Richard said
coldly.

The others in the room didn&#39;t comment on that. &quot;This
is an informal briefing on the Nu-tech research and
development project that produced the rogue recon
models,&quot; Mr. Alexander said, ruffling nervously
through his files.

&quot;Beigh given under protest from the Japan Self Defence
Corps,&quot; Amanda added crisply. She smiled slightly as
she sat down at the table with the others, &quot;All right,
now that I&#39;m on record as saying that what do you want
to know?&quot;

&quot;Weaknesses and capabilities would be good,&quot;
Commisioner Nicholas said dryly. &quot;We&#39;re aware their
internals are different than standard androids.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not quite as simple as you might think,&quot; Mr.
Alexander sighed. He rubbed his nose unconsciously,
&quot;You see, the androids incorperated variable internal
geometry.&quot;

&quot;Shit,&quot; Richard breathed out. Noting the blank look on
Nicholas&#39; face he added, &quot;Each of these androids has
different internal designs.&quot;

&quot;I got that,&quot; he sighed. Nicholas looked over at Mr.
Alexander to ask, &quot;Will the spinal shot work on them,
at least?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but less effectively,&quot; Amanda said. She smiled
wryly, &quot;Studying the Chasers reports we spotted that
problem and wanted to guard against it.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Richard asked.

&quot;Difused nervous system,&quot; Mr. Alexander answered,
&quot;short of blowing a very big hole right through the
middle of one you can&#39;t disrupt the signals.&quot;

&quot;The system also compensates for damage to some
extent,&quot; Amanda continued, &quot;re-routing data around
breaks in the system.&quot;

&quot;So stopping them is going to be a bitch,&quot; Nicholas
groaned. He ran a hand through his hair, &quot;What other
bad news do you have for us?&quot;

&quot;They can&#39;t be tracked, for one,&quot; Mr. Alexander
confessed, &quot;and their capacity to learn and evolve is
about twice what a standard android has. They&#39;ll blend
in very fast, avoid situations where their cover can
be blown and are extremely dangerous if discovered.&quot;

Before someone could ask Amanda stepped up, &quot;We
programmed them using military models along with bits
from insurgency simulations and terrorist manuals.
They can create explosives and arms from common items
as well as capitalize on whatever resources are
available.&quot;

&quot;And we have these things loose in the city?&quot; Richard
blinked.

&quot;And because they can learn we can&#39;t try to predict
where they&#39;ll go or what they&#39;ll do based on their
programs,&quot; Nicholas reasoned.

&quot;The longer they&#39;re out in the field the more
dangerous they become,&quot; Mr. Alexander agreed.

&quot;We tried using a recall signal as soon as they went
rogue,&quot; Amanda said, &quot;no response. We were organizing
a fast response team when the Chasers went in first,
though I suspect that we wouldn&#39;t have done much
better.&quot;

&quot;Considering Gwen used to work for you, I&#39;m not
surprised,&quot; Richard noted.

&quot;What assistance can we reasonably expect?&quot; Nicholas
asked Amanda softly.

&quot;Officially, none,&quot; Amanda said regretfully, &quot;the Self
Defence Corps can&#39;t be seen as being connected to this
situation.&quot;

&quot;And unofficially?&quot; Richard provided.

Amanda flashed a smile, &quot;I&#39;m already making
arrangements with Gwen to bring some former military
types in, plausable deniability intact.&quot;

&quot;How bad is this going to get?&quot; Richard asked. &quot;We can
assume they&#39;re operating on some form of their basic
programing....&quot;

&quot;Sadly, it depends on which of their senarios they&#39;re
running on,&quot; Mr. Alexander admitted before looking
over at Amanda.

&quot;There are several senarios they could be operating
under,&quot; Amanda sighed. &quot;One, a standard recon, two,
sabotage and covert warfare or three....&quot; she
hesitated, &quot;an assasination protocol against a
political leader.&quot;

&quot;Assasination?!&quot; Nicholas blurted.

&quot;They were intended to be expendable field operatives
for the military,&quot; Mr. Alexander said stiffly, &quot;that
included the option of sanctioning targets.&quot;

&quot;I can see why you want deniability on this whole
situation,&quot; Richard observed, &quot;if any of this got out
into the papers you&#39;d be fired.&quot;

&quot;Or resign,&quot; Amanda agreed.

&quot;All right,&quot; Nicholas got up with a sigh, &quot;I think
we&#39;re done, at least for now. I want a transcript
passed on to Chief Musashi and I&#39;ll inform the
Governor personally.&quot; Grabbing his papers he was gone,
leaving the three to depart when they were ready.

&quot;I don&#39;t envy you that job,&quot; Mr. Alexander sighed.
&quot;I&#39;ll have the techs go over the files, see if we can
find any more useful data.&quot;

&quot;Ah,&quot; Richard hesitated, &quot;you aren&#39;t still anngry with
the Chief over the nose?&quot;

Mr. Alexander gave him a look like he didn&#39;t want to
be reminded about that. &quot;I can respect why she did
it,&quot; he said stiffly.

Once he had left Amanda gave Richard a wry smile, &quot;You
had to ask?&quot;

&quot;Just giving them a little reminder,&quot; Richard got up,
grabbing his cane, &quot;that it&#39;s just not a good idea to
mess with Gwen Musashi.&quot;

Amanda looked at him thoughtfully, &quot;And is that
intended for me, too?&quot;

&quot;You can take it as you like, Colonel,&quot; Richard
answered as they left the room together.

&quot;I&#39;m the one who taught Gwen how to play the game,
Doctor,&quot; Amanda answered calmly, &quot;I know the rules as
well as she does.&quot;</pre>
