<p>“Space Station Surprises: accident  or incident?”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“Katie, wait! Hold up a second!  Got dangit, woman, wouldja slow down?!” Allegra gasped and leaned  over so she could catch her breath. When it came to moving quickly,  she was no match for the Heavyworld woman, and even though Kate had  been marching away at a brisk pace, Allegra had to run to catch up  with her, and now she was puffing haplessly. Kate was still angry at  what Allegra had said to her earlier, but she was also still in love  with her, and no matter how much she was hurt, she would probably  keep loving Allegra. They had both pulled each other from the brink  of disaster, vowing to stay by the other’s side, and had been  through too much to part now. Besides, they lived together, and it  would just be too painful to keep holding a grudge.</p>
<p>“Good!” Allegra wheezed, raising  her head so she could look into Shepherd’s eyes. “Glad I got…your  attention. Whew, gimme a minute here. I haven’t ran like that in  years. By the great horn spoon, woman, you sure are fast! Now that I  got your attention, will ya let me apologize?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need,” Kate  grumbled, feeling dejected, stricken, merciful, and deprived all at  once. “The fact of the matter is that you would never stoop to my  level. You think my feelings are beneath your status. I wonder what  you think of the others who are like that, or am I just a special  case?”</p>
<p>“Got dangit, will ya let a gal get  a few words in? First of all, I’m <em>sorry</em>, okay? What I said  was wrong. <em>I</em> was wrong. I want’cha to forgive me for sayin’  something I didn’t mean…something that ain’t true. You’re  prob’ly one of the most ladylike people I’ve known, and I…well,  shoot, Kate, that’s where my second point comes in. I ain’t  nothin’ but a hypocrite.” She grinned weakly, her face turning  red as she stood up and drew nearer. Kate’s defenses were down and  her anger had calmed; she even smiled a little.</p>
<p>“You are a fairly contradictory  person,” she admitted, chuckling softly.</p>
<p>“No doubt. Truth be told,”  Allegra continued shamefully, “I’m prob’ly the <em>least</em> ladylike gal on this ship. I mean, I say I don’t like to get myself  dirty, or work up a sweat, or fight and curse, or any o’ that fun  stuff, but lookit what I do. I oughta be tarred and feathered every  time I accuse someone of bein’ ornery. So I’m sorry for bein’  contradictory. I guess that’s where my third and final point comes  around. What I really wanted to say back then, when you opened up  like that… What I <em>should</em> have said, if there was any brains  in this head o’ mine…”</p>
<p>Allegra’s face turned dark colors,  and she looked away from Kate’s loving eyes, hesitating even now.  Truthfully, she was a coward, a liar, a hypocrite, a cold-blooded  murderer, and a fool, and she admitted it freely. But if Kate still  admired her even with all her faults… If she still loved her—no,  that wasn’t right. Allegra didn’t deserve somebody that great,  and even if she got exactly what was coming to her, she would still…  Finally, she gathered up her courage and stared right into Kate’s  warm jade eyes, boldly shouting her intentions as she wept.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Is that I love you, Katie, and I  always have! I <em>love</em> you! Always have, always will. I’m so  sorry, so sorry… I don’t deserve you, but—“</p>
<p>“Allegra,” Kate barked, glaring  at her firmly. She bumped her hard head against Allegra’s brow and  cradled her chin. “Shut the fuck up.” Allegra grabbed Kathleen  Shepherd desperately and melted into her embrace, kissing until she  was breathless once more. She was not even allowed to whisper; Kate’s  lips silenced her every time.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>With the Acheron sisters engaged in  an “intellectual discussion” with Professor Brignor, Aseria was  once again assigned (forced?) to be the ship’s pilot. Perhaps fate  played a part in this transition, for she decided to dock the <em>Dauntless</em> at a nearby space station. Maybe she wanted to get  out and stretch her legs in a normal environment for once, or maybe  she had cabin fever and wanted to interact with other people and  species. She had enjoyed socializing with the foreigners she met at  the Space Race, and wanted to experience that variety of cultures and  ideas once more. Aseria was also bored with her crewmates; even Naja  and Lil could be tiring after a fashion. She wanted to get out and  meet new people, even if it was only for a day, so she made port and  announced that the crew was free from their “flying prison”.</p>
<p>“It seems our new Captain has  decided our destination for us,” Rachel remarked glumly. She shook  her head and went back to painting Amy’s toenails, paying special  care to her right foot. Miracle giggled, partially because she was  ticklish, and reached out to play with her friend’s violet hair.</p>
<p>“Let her do as she pleases. We  needed to get out and stretch our legs anyway…and we are sort of  low on supplies.”</p>
<p>“Master, you know that if you just  say the word, I can give the <em>Dauntless</em> an endless supply of  everything we need.” Miracle smiled warmly and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No, but thank you. I wouldn’t  use your powers unless I had no other choice. I know full well what  might happen if they’re abused.” She winced as Rachel dried her  nails and put fresh wrappings around her injury, and stood up with  her help.</p>
<p>“So will you be going with them,  Master?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’d like to go on a <em>peaceful</em> adventure for once! Besides, I’ve never been in  zero gee.”</p>
<p>“Be careful,” Rachel said,  pouting cutely as she stroked Amy’s hair. She gently pulled on her  pigtails and giggled. “I can’t have my Master banging around and  getting hurt.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’ll be fine,” she chirped.  “Take care of the ship for me, okay?” Rachel promised she would,  and kissed her hands as she wished her a safe journey. Nobody else  was staying behind: everybody wanted to visit the space station and  get a glimpse of other civilizations. Before the hatch opened, they  were advised that since the station was largely a zero-gee  environment, they would have to climb along the rungs bolted to the  walls, ceiling, and floor, and that if they weren’t careful, the  slightest push would send them hurtling (there were other  instructions, but most of the crew tuned them out). A sensation of  dizziness accompanied the weightlessness, washing over them as the  hatch opened and twenty-three women floated into a new world.</p>
<p>“Wheeeeeeee, I’m flying!!”  Shana squealed deliriously and thrust her legs and arms out as she  floated through the air. Most of the others were a little more  reserved; Aseria was actually crossing her legs and pretending to  meditate as she soared through the passage. Allegra snorted as she  hovered past.</p>
<p>“Show-off.” Shana laughed and  flapped her limbs; it was obvious she had never experienced zero  gravity before. The group came to a sharp turn in the passage and  clung to the side rails as they changed their trajectory, but since  Shana was in free space, she was unable to slow her acceleration, and  panicked as she noticed she was heading for a collision.</p>
<p>“Oh, frak! Someone help me,  please! I’m gonna crash!”</p>
<p>“Silly fool,” Herut sighed as  she swam after her. Mink beat her to the punch, however, bounding off  the ground and soaring after Shana like a dolphin. She caught her in  midair and twisted so that her feet would land against the wall; she  then took hold of a railing and stopped. Shana was flustered and  breathless, and stared into the face of her savior like one who was  lovestruck.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she whispered. Mink’s  mouth twitched into a slight smile.</p>
<p>“You have to take better care of  yourself,” she warned softly. “Why don’t you hold my hand until  you get used to the environment?”</p>
<p>“S…sure,” she squeaked. Mink  sailed after the others with Shana in tow; Herut watched them pass  enviously. Of course, since she had never felt envy before, she  didn’t know what it was or how to handle it, so she was in a bit of  a daze as she followed them to the main pavilion. This was an area  where most of the visitors, staff, and residents congregated: part  cafeteria, garden, shopping mall, social area, entertainment center,  and business environment, the pavilion was abuzz with cacophonous  activity, with every language, custom, and species competing for  space and attention. Despite all of these crowds, it was large enough  to accommodate everything, and spacious enough to allow for a zero-g  environment. Even so, it was very easy to get lost, and one by one,  the fantastic crew of the <em>Dauntless</em> turned into anonymous  shapes and faces.</p>
<p>“Ah!” Vimmy exclaimed, rubbing  her hands together vigorously. “This is my kind of place, yes, look  at how many people there are, this is an ocean of commerce and  community, I’d venture to say one could amass a great deal of  wealth if they lived here, Mink darling, I wonder if this place is up  for sale, hmm, do you know what the upkeep might be, do me a favor  and research it, will you, oh blast, where has that girl gone off to  now, I wonder, did she run off or get lost, that’s not </p>
<p>like her, she’s usually so  responsible—I SAY, MINK, CAN YOU HEAR ME?!” It was useless to  shout: not even Vimmy’s voice could rise above the din. Mink didn’t  forget about her master, she just wanted some time away from her, to  think and to get outside of Vimmy’s watchful gaze. She had taken  Shana to an observation deck and was getting a lesson in astronomy.</p>
<p>While Herut was struggling with an  emotional maelstrom, a poor little coracle thrust into a storm, Eve  had a more staggering challenge to overcome: trying to find her way  out of this living entanglement. She had never been that good with  directions, and a large place filled to the brim with people, most of  them floating around like kites, made her feel downright sick. She  wallowed her way to a more isolated wing, and leaned against the  wall, out of the way, and breathed a little easier. But it got dull  just standing there resting, so she decided to explore the less  cluttered area, and floated gracefully down the hallway, meekly  swinging from rail to rail. She skimmed over several hallways and  rooms during her exploration, picking out shipmates and friends every  now and then, but something in one of the rooms caused her to stop  and grab hold of a rail. She peered closer and noticed the Director  of the United Military, Clarissa Astor, was in the room, speaking to  some advisors.</p>
<p>Eve didn’t mean to stare, but  hanging there for so long drew some attention. Clarissa noticed her  and waved, which her bodyguards interpreted as a signal for action.  They drew out their dart-guns—  heavy weaponry was expressly forbidden on a space station—  but Astor ordered them to stand down, and floated out to meet the  famous mechanic, who she had not seen since the Space Race.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Kasberry, we meet  again. Accident or incident?”</p>
<p>“Incident,” she answered,  crossing her arms defiantly. She didn’t dislike the Director—  on the contrary, she really respected her—  but she wanted to keep her guard up anyway. “We’re just here for  a pit stop. I’m not sure where we’re going next, but it can’t  be healthy. You know how it is: one adventure after another.” Astor  laughed and gave Eve a look of understanding.</p>
<p>“Believe me, I know precisely what  you mean.” She turned around and dismissed her bodyguards,  apparently trusting herself with the young vagabond. Only one other  person remained, a woman slightly younger than the Director, her hair  long and dark, and her skin as green as Sharyn’s. Eve idly wondered  if they shared a similar gene pool as she glimpsed at her.</p>
<p>“Float with me, if you would,”  Clarissa requested. “This is my advisor, right-hand officer,  friend, and wife, Iona. Iona, this is the lady I told you about.”</p>
<p>“A pleasure,” she cooed in a  rich voice. Eve grumbled.</p>
<p>“I ain’t exactly a lady here,  Director.” The two women laughed quietly and apologized.</p>
<p>“No, I suppose not. I was  surprised to find you here, Miss Kasberry, although I guess I  shouldn’t be. This is an excellent place to meet people. Have you  had the chance to see your old boss?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“You mean the woman you claim is  my mother?” she snorted. “No, not yet. I guess I should suggest  it to our pilots since we don’t have anywhere else to be. So just  how do you know the old grease monkey, anyway? I can’t see the  Wrench ever befriending a suit like you.”</p>
<p>“We met a long time ago,”  Clarissa grinned, “and we’ve worked together for years. Do you  know anything about the great age of space exploration that boomed  thirty years back?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? Not very much. Riene’s  the expert. She told me she was writing a dissertation on the  twenty-six teams that led the movement. Hell, even Alala would know  more than I do. She went to your old Alma Maters, if I’m not  mistaken.”</p>
<p>“Phobos and Ares Academies? Hmm,  I’ve heard of an exemplary Felinis who became valedictorian there  recently. And you say you know someone named Riene, right? Would that  be Riene Latoli, by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Eve said stiffly,  wondering how this woman knew her companions. The galaxy was getting  bigger and bigger, it seemed, making connecting with others more  difficult with every passing age. To say that you knew somebody, even  as a casual friend, was becoming infrequent. Clarissa smiled at Eve  as the trio turned another corner.</p>
<p>“Introduce me, will you? I’d  like to speak with them. Perhaps I can finally answer a few questions  and talk about old times.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Eve shrugged in  bemusement, “but I have no idea where they are.”</p>
<p>“That won’t be a problem,”  Clarissa smirked, indicating a PA device.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Let’s  take our time and enjoy this vacation; we’ve earned it. Before I  dismiss you, however, remember that the Director herself will be  here, so I want you to represent the <em>Neo Yamato</em> well.  Dismissed.” Captain Kaori Chuunaru breathed a sigh of relief as she  floated away from her military duties and into the space station. She  and her crew had an entire week to enjoy themselves here (and on the  resort world below) before they were called back to duty, and she  vowed to make the most of her time. After parting with her crew, she  headed to the mall, determined to buy a new swimsuit. She already had  one, of course, but it was so bland and unflattering that it may as  well have been military-issue. She wanted something daring, something  racy and revealing— maybe even a  little naughty. She worked too hard and put up with too much stress,  and deserved to spoil herself at least once.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Kaori turned a corner, she  accidentally slammed into another floater, and coiled back in pain.  She reached out and yanked one of the rails so she wouldn’t fly out  of control, rubbing her head with her free hand. The other person, a  woman, whined quietly as she nursed herself.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, are you okay?”  Kaori asked as she soared down. “It was my fault, Miss. I was in a  hurry and didn’t watch where I was going.”</p>
<p>“Uh, hehe, don’t sweat it,”  replied the girl. “I was on the wrong side of the passage anyway.  Let me make it up to you and buy a…KAORI!!”</p>
<p><em>Buy me a what? Uh-oh, here she  comes!</em></p>
<p>CRASH!</p>
<p>“Kaori Chuunaru!” the girl  squealed, squeezing her tight as they drifted aimlessly through the  air. Kaori’s face turned red as the stranger hugged her, and the  shade deepened even more when the girl started to lick her.</p>
<p>“H-hey, who the hell are you? Get  off me! S-stop that! I don’t even know who you are!” The other  girl sat up suddenly, her tail stiff and her furry ears perked up in  shock.</p>
<p>“Wah? Don’t tell me you’ve  forgotten me, Kaori-chan! Come on, your memory can’t be that bad!  Don’t you remember? My father Master Hayao Yeriman’s dojo, about  twelve years ago? There was a half-Inu girl you used to spar with!  C’mon, Chuunaru, we were friends!” Merely by staring at the  excitable woman brought up long-buried thoughts and emotions, and  listening to her helped uncover far deeper moments that finally  brought a name and an identity to the face. Kaori laughed and sat up,  clapping the woman on the shoulders.</p>
<p>“Oh, right, Sati Yeriman! I can’t  believe it’s you! I’m sorry I didn’t recognize you earlier!”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s cool,” she  squealed, giving Kaori another smothering hug. “I don’t expect  you full-blooded humans to have our sharp sense of smell! I wouldn’t  have been able to remember you either if I hadn’t caught your  scent.”</p>
<p>“I hope that’s an Inu thing and  not an insult,” Kaori smirked. She took a long look at Sati and  beamed as memories of her youth came to light. When she was young, so  long ago it seemed, she had studied at a Quantum Ju Jitsu dojo under  a superlative master, and was a friendly rival of a cheerful,  outspoken half-Inu, a human with some doggish features. She and Sati  had been fairly close back then, but they hadn’t seen each other in  years until today.</p>
<p><em>She’s grown into a beautiful  woman,</em> Kaori noticed.</p>
<p>“You look terrific!” she said  aloud. Satri grinned and gave Kaori a friendly shove.</p>
<p>“Aw, thanks. You’ve certainly  grown up and filled out. I’ll bet you’re fighting off the boys  left and right.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” she muttered  sourly. “Being a military cog curtails one’s romantic pursuits.  Besides, I’m…not entirely interested in having a man for a  partner.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, who needs to be tied down  these days!” Sati squealed, putting her arm around Kaori’s  shoulder. She wasn’t used to being that intimate with anybody, but  it was okay; they were old friends. “I’m not surprised you’re  with the UCM, though,” Sati said calmly. “I always knew you’d  move on to great things. Ya know, when I heard there was a rising  star called Captain Chuunaru in the ranks, I knew that it was you.  Who else would have a weird name like that?”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” she gagged. Sati  laughed and gave her friend another hug.</p>
<p>“I kid, I kid! I really am proud  of you, though. But look at us! Do we have a lot to catch up on or  what? Um, I mean, if you’re not too busy.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m on vacation.”</p>
<p>“Aw, lucky timing! Say, let me buy  you that thing I promised earlier and we’ll call it a date!”</p>
<p>“A date?” Kaori laughed. “You’re  not my type, Sati.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it like that. I  came here for a job, but I wanna have fun, too. At least let’s find  somewhere we can chat and have a bite to eat. My treat.” Talk about  making puppy-dog eyes… Kaori smirked and rolled her eyes, unable to  resist her pleading.</p>
<p>“I guess I can date outside my  range every once in awhile. Lead the way.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>“May I ask a question to start us  off?” Sati said. “It’s nothing personal; I just wanted to know  if you were in the Space Race.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I didn’t do very well.  I was a little busy policing the area.”</p>
<p>“So that’s where all those  strict rules came from,” she smirked as she sipped her coffee. “But  there was a lot of rule-breaking going on. People were attacked,  driven off course, their ships were disabled…I even heard about  someone that committed suicide after the race.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell you very much  about it,” Kaori murmured. “But I do wish I had known you were  there. I didn’t recognize your name when they called you.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I recognized yours!” she  yelped in offense. But Sati was just pretending; she knew that twelve  years was a very long time to remember anything, even a person’s  scent. “But anyway, it looks like we both moved up in the world.  You’re a Captain in the military, and I? Well, let’s just say  that I’m a freelancer. I work for people who need…odd jobs done.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“A bounty hunter?” Sati nodded  shyly. “Don’t be embarrassed. The military has excellent  relationships with a few bounty hunters. It’s like they’re a  necessary part of society, teetering on that thin grey line that  separates dark and light. Have you ever heard of Shandra Hill?”</p>
<p>“<em>Heard</em> of her? I’ve  worked for her! Her niece Becky and I are friends!”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, then she <em>must</em> be like me. You’d never approach an extrovert.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, she’s like you, all  right: totally in the closet!”</p>
<p>“And what does that mean?” Kaori  scoffed. Sati grinned and said it was nothing. The two women  regressed back into a comfortable silence, finishing their meals and  drinks. Kaori took the trays away as a gesture of thanks, and  returned in time to hear a rather intimate question:</p>
<p>“So, Captain Chuunaru, <em>are </em>you  in love with anyone?”</p>
<p>“Me?” she smiled softly.  “Heavens, what a thing to ask. I don’t have time for romance.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask you that. I asked  if you were <em>in love</em>.” Kaori closed her eyes, folded her  hands, and thought about it for awhile. Was she? And if so, who  indeed?</p>
<p>“I believe so,” she murmured  cautiously. “I think. She came into my life all of a sudden and  stole my heart. She had soft, sweet lips and skin like polished  copper, golden buttery-brown and bursting with passion. Yes, Sati: <em>she.</em> I’ve fought this losing battle for so long, and it’s  time I surrender. I am attracted to women. Perhaps I’m attracted to  the wrong kind of woman, though.”</p>
<p>“I’m just happy you’re being  honest with yourself,” she chirped. “I’m sort of half-and-half,  although if you put me in a room with a shy, sexy, quiet little  vixen, well…I’m not sure how long I could behave myself. I’m  actually in love with one right now.”</p>
<p>“You’re certain,” Kaori  stated. Sati confirmed it happily. “I’m envious. If only I could  be so positive.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to tell you,”  Sati gestured. “I’m sure any advice I could give would only lead  to disaster. Just keep testing the waters, I suppose. You know, don’t  rush into it and all that crap. I might be in love, but it’s not as  if I have a girlfriend…if that makes any sense.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it does,” Kaori chuckled.  “It means we’re in the same boat.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t think so,” she  grumbled, sticking her tongue out.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alala squirmed in her seat as the  Director of the United Cosmic Military studied her. Like most people,  she only saw celebrities like this on broadcast, so meeting one in  person, and being so close to her, was a little unnerving. On the  opposite side of the spectrum was Riene, who had cheered up  considerably when Astor invited her to have lunch. She tried not to  gush like a silly schoolgirl as she shook Clarissa’s hand and sat  down with her. Eve, of course, was as indifferent as ever, a peaceful  medium to balance the two extremes.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for taking time out  of your day to be here,” Clarissa began, her voice firm and  peaceful. “It’s a supreme honor to finally meet you two in  person. First, Riene Latoli, a student of my old friend Raven, God  rest her soul, and one of the biographers who’s researched the  space expansionist movement.”</p>
<p>“Mostly the team that you were a  part of, Madam Director. Squad Reliable has been an inspiration to me  for years. The honor is, um, all mine.”</p>
<p>“Relax,” Clarissa grinned. “I’m  not as stiff-necked as you might think. You don’t have to worry  about formalities around Iona or me. Um…you know, I’m sorry to  hear about Raven’s passing; she was a wonderful friend.”</p>
<p>“And an excellent teacher,”  Riene nodded. “But she led a good life, and she left us very  happily, with many surviving children to resume her work. Have  you…had the chance to see her wife?”</p>
<p>“Yes, fairly recently. Trina’s  pulled together well. I only regret I was unable to attend the  funeral. But we’re getting off topic. You, Miss Alala,” she said  to her, “are the person I have wanted to meet the most.”</p>
<p>“Why me?” she squeaked, her ears  starting to burn.</p>
<p>“Well, for one, we had common  instructors. I heard you knew Headmaster and Dr. Stellkei quite  well.”</p>
<p>“Uh, probably not as much as you,”  she stammered. Clarissa wasn’t just famous, she was friendly and  warm, and quite beautiful. Her long, dark hair had silvery streaks in  it, and her eyes were a bold, smoky grey color, soft as storm clouds  but with the strength of iron.</p>
<p>“Secondly,” she resumed, “we  share a similar fame. You, I, and Keiko Ozmund are the only women who  received valedictorian at Ares and Phobos Academies, and to my  knowledge, only one man has achieved the same. You’re a genius,  Miss Alala, and if it’s not too forward of me, I’d like to offer  you an internship at the UCM. You have the potential to be Director  one day.”</p>
<p>“M…ME?!” she screamed.  “The…DIRECTOR of the MILITARY?! A…are you <em>serious?</em>”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, completely,” she  answered. “You certainly have the academic qualifications, and  based on instructor reviews and Shiho’s evaluation—  I mean, the Headmaster’s— you  could easily make the nomination in a few years. You would certainly  make history if you were elected, being the first Felinis Director.  Does that sound like something you would be interested in?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Alala was fighting to keep herself  from crying. The only people who had ever believed in her were her  mother, her two girlfriends from the Academies, Amy, and Yenae.  Everyone else had either underestimated her, worked to tear her  spirit, stereotyped her, or completely ignored her, so hearing  somebody finally say something encouraging was startling. It threw  her emotions into whack and made her feel like a stranger in her own  body.</p>
<p>“Do you really believe I could?”  she whimpered. Clarissa smiled brightly and lifted the noble Felinis’  chin.</p>
<p>“I don’t just believe it, Alala,  I <em>know</em> it could happen. I would be honored to groom you as my  successor…but that’s your decision to make. Give it a few weeks  to think it over. Here, take this: it’s my administrator’s  number. Call him when you’ve made your decision, and he’ll fill  me in.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” Alala whispered, as  her tears began to fall at last. Clarissa gave her a tissue and  focused on Riene, who was still enamored.</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Latoli, it’s back to  you now. Just how much do you know about the eighteenth space  exploration squad?”</p>
<p>“Little more than what my teacher  told me. I’ve read the Admiral’s log and several journals the  crew made during the voyage, but I’m still unclear about what  happened after.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I could fill you in,”  she said, scooting closer. “As you know, Ravne Bronson went on to  teach languages after she retired from diplomacy, and married Trina  Mack, who became a renowned botanist. She passed away recently, and  judging from my last visit, Trina’s coping fairly well. She has her  hands full with the family and her work, but I believe she’s ready  to join Raven at any minute. Shiho and Ivy were also married, and  they worked to improve the education system of the Helios worlds.  They helped found Ares and Phobos Academies, and were also champions  of health care. You saw them at the Space Races, right?</p>
<p>“Lenneth and I have probably  achieved the most fame over the years. I’m sure you all know that  she first brought the valuable material that bears her name to our  attention— Lennethium—  and she even helped discover a way to create it synthetically. It’s  revolutionized the way we approach space travel. As for Wendy and  Chelsea, we mostly lost contact with them. They slipped off the radar  shortly after our voyage ended and rarely kept in touch, which was  their right, I suppose. I saw them recently, however; they’re  distraught over a great loss in the family. Wendy has a child, you  see, about your age, and she’s been missing for the past three  years. Anyway, she became quite the therapist, and Chelsea’s been  at her side ever since. As for Carly’s fate, you can just ask Miss  Kasberry here.</p>
<p>“Of course, we’ve also lost  quite a few over the years. Fole was the first. Four years after our  journey ended, Mika died as well, from a rare form of breast cancer,  of all things. She was my bodyguard, my best friend, and the love of  my life, and I mourned her for a whole year. But I did find the  strength to move on, and was even able to open my heart again. Do you  know what became of the Admiral and the Helmswoman?”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Um, yes,” Riene muttered,  rubbing her temples in an effort to invigorate her memory. “They  were killed about twenty years ago when Gaea was attacked by an alien  race. Ach, darn, I forgot their name.”</p>
<p>“They called themselves the  Lurgans,” Iona stated solemnly. She had not spoken much until then,  because she had been listening intently, drinking everything through  her eyes and ears and skin, until she was filled and suffused with  her surroundings. This seemed to be a tender subject, for her musical  trilling dipped to a monotone, and she held Clarissa’s hand as she  spoke. “Because of this unwarranted attack, they were considered a  pariah. The truth, however, is that they are actually a peaceful  people, and the ones who Admiral Astor tried negotiating with, and  died protecting Gaea from, were a splinter group labeled as ‘Bent  Lurgans’ by the majority. I am, shamefully, the daughter of the  Bent Lurgans’ leader.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I thought I had recognized  your name,” Riene pointed. “And Director, is it true that you  also single-handedly prevented a war between the two races?”</p>
<p>“Something like that,” she said  stiffly, blushing a little. “It’s true that I <em>helped</em>, but  I certainly didn’t do it alone. Marrying Iona in spite of the  protests, and coming to terms with the majority of her people, were  what really prevented the bloodshed. That’s what nominated me as  Director, in any case, so I suppose my grandmother and Dulcinea would  be proud of me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, most certainly,” Riene  said, smiling cheerfully. “The three of you are heroes.”</p>
<p>“If you say so,” Clarissa  shrugged. “I just kept an open mind and refused to be swayed by  popular opinion. Falling in love with the daughter of the enemy just  sort of happened.”</p>
<p>“And what a long, rough, wondrous  courtship it was,” Iona said melodiously. Riene was given time to  finish her notes as Eve and Alala absorbed everything. They knew a  little bit about the subject, but not as much as they were entitled  to. A sense of honor overcame them when they realized, to an extent,  they were a part of this history now: Riene and Alala the students,  and Eve…</p>
<p>“This is all well and good,” she  said, “but I still don’t believe you. You know what I’m talking  about.”</p>
<p>“Good! Keep it up,” Clarissa  encouraged her. “Don’t believe anybody until you discover the  facts. There is only one way you will ever know.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” she sighed. “So I  guess now we have our next destination. Welp, ladies, I’ve had  enough sitting around. I’m gonna go see if I can score a few jobs  while I’m here. You kids take care and behave, now.” She grinned  teasingly as she left; Riene smiled at her while Alala snorted.</p>
<p>“Like she can talk down to us.”</p>
<p>　</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p align="center">　</p>
<p><em>I had no idea the Wrench was a  part of all </em><em><u>that</u></em><em>,</em> Eve thought to herself as  she slipped out of the conference room. <em>She didn’t talk much  about her past, or anything else for that matter. Mostly just taught  me how to work with machines… Well, I only knew her for about two  years. There’s only so much you can talk about in that time.</em></p>
<p>“That’s right,” she snorted,  smiling bitterly. “She never had the time to tell me anything. I  asked her for work and she gave it to me. We just couldn’t get  close. Damn, what if that woman was telling the truth? Yea or nay,  I’ll have one hell of an icebreaker when I see the old bat.”</p>
<p>“Talking to yourself, princess?”  Eve jerked around to snarl at whoever was fool enough to insult her  like that, but her ears burned and her heart raced as she saw her  playful tormentor. Astor <em>did</em> say that this was a good place to  meet people…</p>
<p>“Quin? Oh my god, what are you  doing here?” Quincy Winchester, the Jackal, smiled warmly and honed  in on her lover like the animal she was.</p>
<p>“I’m stalking you, of course.”  She curled her fingers around Eve’s chin and drew her lips close to  drink from their bittersweet nectar. She giggled as she noticed Eve’s  bewildered expression and tapped her nose. “Just kidding. I  actually have a job here, kind of. It feels wonderful to see you  again. I heard your group placed third in the Race. Apparently, I  wagered on the right people. Have you had any luck with your mother  yet?” Eve snapped out of her daze and glowered, turning away from  her capricious lover.</p>
<p>“Um…no. Jeez, you had to remind  me of that.” Quincy giggled and caressed Eve’s face.</p>
<p>“Touchy subject? Let’s switch,  then. I’m staying at the hotel here and taking advantage of the  spa, all expenses paid by my client. Why don’t you come join me  sometime? A little pampering is good for the soul. And if you  prefer,” she purred seductively, sucking softly on Eve’s ear, “I  could just trade places with the masseuse.” Eve almost swooned as  she melted under Quincy’s smoldering aura; she was just able to  whisper her response.</p>
<p>“Oohhh…yes.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, delightful. Come with me.”  The Jackal led her by the hand back to the main pavilion, where they  would take a ride up to the third floor, where the station’s spa  was. Because it would be impractical, confusing, and dangerous having  everyone flying around the pavilion by themselves, a system of cables  carried them around, just like a ski lift. All you had to do was grab  hold and wait for it to drop you off at your floor. Quincy made the  journey a little more intimate by putting her arm around Eve’s  waist and sneaking a quick kiss on her neck before shuffling off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Here,” she said, guiding her to  the front door. Normally, these doors opened automatically, but as  they approached it, they remained completely unresponsive. Quincy  even knocked on the glass, and tried prying them open herself. There  was nobody inside to help her. “That’s weird!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“You’d think so,” came a low,  rough voice from behind. The women felt the tip of a high-intensity  electric prod touch the back of their heads, and two pairs of hands  quickly shot out to frisk them for weapons. After throwing out  Quincy’s knives, garrote wire, phone, and stun gun (Eve didn’t  bring anything), the two women were asked to turn around so they  could face their captors. As they figured, they were nondescript  people covered head to toe in dark cloth. They had sunglasses and  even wore a voice scrambler over their mouths, leaving no detail to  chance.</p>
<p>“All services have been  discontinued,” said the one nearest to them. “Kindly cooperate  until this ordeal is over.” The person gestured that they should  start walking now, and so Eve and Quincy went along with them,  noticing that they were not the only victims. Every exit and entrance  was being locked, blocked, and guarded, communication lines were  disrupted, and people were being corralled together. Eve and Quincy  stared warily at each other.</p>
<p>“Does this pertain to your job?”</p>
<p>“Seems that way.”</p>
<p>The space station was being held  hostage. Amy Miracle grumbled when she heard the news.</p>
<p>“So much for my peaceful  adventure.”</p>
