<h1>Angel's Gift (part 29 of 36)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/angelgift-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>The Liberty&#39;s Sword slip-transited, moving through the
higher dimensions as it traveled to it&#39;s latest
destination. The bridge was quiet as they voyaged on,
Allison looking out the viewscreen as her sandy blonde
hair fell into her eyes. The bridge was strangely
empty, the seats all around her empty but oddly it
didn&#39;t bother her.

&quot;M&#39;love,&quot; the voice murmured.

Allison turned in her seat, looking in surprise at the
woman who stood in the door to the bridge. Jenna&#39;s
long black hair fell in waves down her back, her blue
eyes gentle as she smiled. Entirely nude her full
breasts bounced as she walked, and strangely the
lovely wings she had shown Allison only once before
stretched from her back.

Jenna stalked across the bridge then settled down in
Allison&#39;s lap, stroking her hair from her eyes. &quot;What
are you...?&quot; Allison squeaked.

&quot;Shh,&quot; Jenna whispered as they kissed, her black hair
flowing around the two of them as she slid into
Allison&#39;s arms.

&quot;I&#39;d give that a nine out of ten,&quot; Kat commented,
holding up a sign.

Laurel shook her head, &quot;Seven, tops.&quot;

Sharin frowned, long blonde hair gleaming from where
they sat over to the side, &quot;Oh come on, they should
get a point added for enthusiasm.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Amara agreed, her boyish black hair
falling into her eyes.

&quot;Mistress!&quot; Milly sobbed, cat ears drooping, &quot;How
could you?!&quot;

&quot;THAT was MY question,&quot; the voice boomed out, the
shadowy figure standing ominously in the doorway, her
gold crown gleaming. She raised a royal scepter
menacingly, the end flickered with a dangerous
light....

.... and with a gasp Allison came awake, looking
around her small cabin in surprise. She turned and
felt a flash of relief at seeing Jenna curled up
beside her. Allison got up from the bed, trying not to
disturb her sleeping lover as she walked out to the
small sitting room, sitting down on the couch with a
sigh.

&quot;Well that was an odd dream,&quot; Allison said tiredly,
her plain boxers and white t-shirt covering her slim
frame.

&quot;How so?&quot; the familiar voice asked. Allison nearly
jumped before she realized it was Milly, the red
headed catgirl carrying a cup of tea into the room
without asking. She sat it down in front of Allison,
&quot;Can&#39;t sleep?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Allison took the tea gratefully
then took a drink.

&quot;So what did you dream?&quot; Milly asked curiously as she
sat down beside her, red tail flicking gently against
her legs. Her old fashioned nightdress looked oddly
out of place, yet it seemed to suit the young woman
very well.

&quot;I.. well...&quot; Allison blushed.

&quot;Ah,&quot; Milly nodded sagely, &quot;one of THOSE dreams.&quot; She
sipped her own cup of tea, &quot;Something naughty, I take
it?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Allison softly admitted, her cheeks faintly
red. She looked over at the amused but sympathetic
catgirl, &quot;Jenna and I were... you know, then we got
interrupted by most of my friends and Jenna&#39;s mother.&quot;

&quot;Fun,&quot; Milly smirked. She looked at Allison
thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;re feeling nervous about us
arriving in Throne system soon?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Allison conceded, &quot;it&#39;s less than a day from
Jenna&#39;s home system, more or less, and I still don&#39;t
know how her mother is going to react.&quot;

&quot;The queen sent this vessel for Jenna,&quot; Milly reminded
her, &quot;she must want her and her companions to return
home.&quot;

&quot;I just wish I knew how the Queen will react to us
being bonded,&quot; Allison shrugged.

&quot;I think she&#39;ll like you,&quot; Milly reassured her then
her eyes twinkled, &quot;besides, you&#39;re bringing a string
of victories in your wake. Four Star Empire cruisers
engaged in combat these past few weeks, and three
destroyed.&quot;

&quot;Luck,&quot; Allison said gruffly, &quot;and a good crew.&quot;

&quot;Luck and skill,&quot; Milly corrected. She looked at
Allison thoughtfully, &quot;You&#39;re humble and that&#39;s good,
but you need to blow your own horn, too.&quot;

Allison shrugged uncomfortably.

Since leaving the Sentinel supply station the
Liberty&#39;s Sword had faced two Star Empire vessels in
combat, battlecruisers of the same or better class
than themselves. The battles had been fierce, but
Allison continued to find herself astonished at how
the two societies went to war. There were rigid
customs on how ships approached each other and engaged
in combat, ones that made the enemy easily predictable
for Allison.

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right,&quot; Allison conceded, smiling at the
girl wryly. She got up with a yawn, stretching a bit,
&quot;I&#39;d better get back to bed....&quot;

Before she could finish they heard the whoop of the
alert alarm, sirens ringing through the small room.
Reflexedly Allison bolted to her room, rushing to grab
her uniform and pull it on. Jenna blinked owlishly as
she sat up in bed, &quot;Wha&#39; goin&#39; on?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know,&quot; Allison answered as she did up her black
uniform top, then sat down to pull her pants and boots
on.

&quot;Mistress,&quot; Milly bounded in, the catgirl helping
Jenna out of bed.

&quot;I&#39;ll meet you on the bridge, m&#39;love,&quot; Allison said as
she bolted out of the room after gently kissing Jenna
on the cheek. She raced through the corridors to the
lifts, then up to the bridge where the men and women
of the night shift worked intently.

&quot;Captain on the bridge,&quot; midshipman Col&#39; Tyrr
announced, his green hair falling down his muscular
back in a ponytail.

Allison ran a hand through her hair as she walked to
the center seat, Lieutenant Sam C&#39;tarn bouncing to his
feet. &quot;We&#39;ve encountered distortion effect from a
large number of vessels in slip-transit,&quot; the older
man reported, bald head gleaming, &quot;identity unknown,
but the power signatures match our fleet.&quot;

&quot;Can we hail them?&quot; Allison asked as she took her
seat. The feel of the bridge was nervous but still
confident, everyone doing their best to handle their
jobs.

&quot;We&#39;ll have to drop into real-space,&quot; Max answered as
he took a seat in the chair usually reserved for the
second in command, &quot;and gamble they&#39;ll do so, too.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve detected us, I assume?&quot; Allison asked.

&quot;Most likely,&quot; Amara commented, her sandy brown hair
falling into her eyes. She frowned as her scanners
beeped, &quot;Sensors say they&#39;re transiting to normal
space.&quot;

Allison made a snap decision, &quot;Go to battle stations,
please.&quot; As the alarms began to wail she looked at the
officer on navigation, &quot;Bring us back into normal
space.&quot; Then to tactical, &quot;I want weapons ready, but
keep the targeting systems off-line.&quot;

&quot;Aye sir,&quot; Rachel A&#39;Tor, the midshipman calm and
collected at the tactical station. Amara had been
working with her on tactical, and was certain that the
girl had real promise, which was why she was on that
station tonight.

There was a shudder as Amara shifted the drives,
changing the energy fields around the ship to ease
them out of shift-space and back into normal reality.
The viewscreen shifted as outer space stretched out
around them, then in a wave of distortion the other
ships appeared.

&quot;My god,&quot; Allison breathed out.

In a moment the void of space was filled with vessels,
or at least that&#39;s how it seemed. The vessels raged
from light cruisers to star destroyers, and all of
them were dwarfed by the flagship, the ship nearly
three times the size of the Liberty&#39;s Sword.

&quot;Home Fleet,&quot; Max said quietly, his eyes wide. He
frowned, &quot;They normally don&#39;t leave the Throne,
though...&quot;

Silently Jenna settled into a seat, herself dressed in
a simple one piece. Unlike Allison she looked lovely,
as if she had spent a hour getting ready, not minutes.
&quot;It is unusual,&quot; she agreed softly.

&quot;Hail the fleet,&quot; Allison ordered crisply.

The connection was made, but surprisingly they weren&#39;t
connected to some vessel&#39;s bridge. Instead an older,
regal woman gazed out of the screen, her face oddly
familiar. Black hair, touched with silver fell over
her shoulders, and her expression was warmly gentle.

&quot;Mother,&quot; Jenna breathed.

Queen Jen&#39;ai smiled, &quot;It&#39;s good to have you home,
daughter.&quot;</pre>
