<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 46 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch45.html">Back to Part 45</a><pre>      Tsuru hoped that after one embarrassing event, she would be able to survive. It seemed 
Carmilla was too tired to bother her and had to take a nap. Even if she was a vampire lord 
that could walk around during the day, it took a lot out of her.

      In order to get herself out of more backbreaking training, Tsuru volunteered to 
cook... more like bake. She figured it would be nice for all five of them to sit down and 
eat together. As she was frosting the cake, Hina came into the kitchen.

      &quot;That looks so yummy!&quot;

      Tsuru looked up, frosting all over her left hand from steadying the cake. &quot;Thanks. I 
hope it tastes good.&quot;

      The blonde girl said bashfully, &quot;Can I try some?&quot;

      Tsuru smiled. &quot;Sure, just the frosting though. It would be odd to serve a cake with a 
missing slice...&quot;

      Without warning, Hina reached across the counter to grab Tsuru&#39;s hand. The woman 
didn&#39;t know what was happening until the little girl&#39;s mouth engulfed one of her poor, 
frosting covered fingers. She couldn&#39;t help but gawk at the blonde girl suckling so 
intensely on her appendage. Tsuru thought she was going to faint when she felt Hina&#39;s tongue 
seek out the remaining frosting.

      Tsuru didn&#39;t even notice that the act was over until Hina said, &quot;Mmm, a bit too sweet, 
but I&#39;m sure the cake will balance it out.&quot;

      The girl was smiling innocently at her as Tsuru forced her body to work and nodded her 
head. Hina bounced off as Tsuru braced herself on the counter. It... just had to be her 
imagination. Right...? It wasn&#39;t like the three sisters were really coordinating an assault 
on Tsuru&#39;s weakness for cute girls... 

***** 

      Tsuru started to rethink her earlier assessment when Hoshi challenged her to a 
friendly duel. &quot;So... if you fix your stance like this,&quot; Hoshi murmured in Tsuru&#39;s ear, her 
hand on the Demon Lord&#39;s, trying to perfectly position the sword.

      It didn&#39;t help that the silver haired woman was so intimately pressed up against 
Tsuru, her arm around her waist and... The Lord of Demons tried not to concentrate too much 
on the breast pressed so lovingly against her back or the legs nearly entwined with her own.

      It was... just a friendly sword fight... It wasn&#39;t like Hoshi was purposefully trying 
to &#39;teach&#39; her while in a very provocative, seductive position. Not at all. 

***** 

      By this time, Tsuru was so worn out and distraught that she was glad Carmilla was 
nowhere around. The last thing she needed was to get ravished and-

      Well, maybe it was the first thing she needed, but for Tsuru, that was beside the 
point. It all came to a head when Tsuki knocked on her door, talking about taking a bath. 
Tsuru had innocently assumed that Tsuki would be leading her to a bathroom, but... well...

      For the second time that day, she stared. The moment they stepped into the indoor 
bath, Tsuru&#39;s eyes immediately shot up to a standing, fully nude Hoshi. The silver haired 
woman was facing the door, having just disrobed. She was talking lightly to Hina, also 
naked, but in the water. Tsuki stared to undress and for a moment, all three sisters shared 
a look.

      The laughter soon brought Tsuru out of her trance and she turned around. &quot;I... I think 
I&#39;m going to go find another bathroom so I don&#39;t i-intrude on you three-&quot;

      As she tried to escape, Tsuru felt a tug on the collar of her shirt and knew she was 
doomed. 

***** 

      &quot;And they proceeded to wash me...!&quot; Isaka had to hold the phone away from her ear at 
the sound of Tsuru&#39;s whining.

      The demon let out a sigh. &quot;Are you listening to yourself right now? You&#39;re complaining 
about three very attractive girls getting really friendly with you in a bath.&quot;

      Tsuru was silent. &quot;But still! I assumed that the three of them would only be in their 
exclusive triangle of sister love and that they&#39;d be so traumatized as to not be so 
friendly. It- it&#39;s like while I was doing something else, they got together and had a &#39;let&#39;s 
seduce Tsuru&#39; meeting!&quot;

      &quot;Tsuru, you mope when a girl doesn&#39;t like you and you have four chasing you. Speaking 
of which, where&#39;s Carmilla?&quot;

      Isaka heard a sigh on the other line. &quot;Well, I escaped the bath as soon as I could and 
I&#39;m hiding in my room because the last thing I want is for Carmilla to find out why I&#39;m 
still red in the face... this is horrible! Why did I think staying with them was a good 
idea?&quot;

      There was a long moment of silence before Isaka said, &quot;So... is your sisterly harem 
good at what they do?&quot;

      &quot;...yeah...&quot; Tsuru murmured. &quot;They seem to know exactly how to wash you provocatively 
without actually doing anything...&quot;

      It was then that Isaka perked up at the sound of the apartment door opening. &quot;Ooh, 
Krystal&#39;s home! Have fun with your harem, Tsuru, I&#39;ve got an exorcist to devour!&quot;

      She hung up without warning to go surprise her lover. 

***** 

      Tsuru let out a groan and flipped her cell phone shut. Why did she think calling Isaka 
would be a good idea...? Then again, who else? Bakra wouldn&#39;t understand and anyone else 
would...

      She curled up in her bed, deciding it was a good time to go to sleep. Her body was 
still hot from the &#39;friendly bath&#39; with the sisters. Maybe Carmilla was right... Tsuru 
jolted up at the knock on her door. Her lap was on, casting a dim shadow across the floor as 
her mysterious intruder came inside.

      If only Tsuru had a special ability to disappear... Carmilla smiled at her, a 
mischievous glint in her eyes. &quot;Hey, Tsuru. Sorry I left you alone all day...&quot;

      Tsuru scooted away, her back hitting the wall as she tried to raise the covers over 
herself. &quot;Oh, it&#39;s fine. I mean, you don&#39;t have to feel obligated to be with me or 
anything.&quot;

      Carmilla&#39;s smiled only grew as she walked forward, taking the clip out of her hair, 
letting her long silvery blue locks. &quot;You know... Tsuru... it&#39;s quite hot in here...&quot; With 
that, the vampire undid her black dress and let it pool around her feet.

      Alarms went off into Tsuru&#39;s head and she knew... she knew that Carmilla wanted to be 
a little friendly with her tonight. She gawked at the black lace lingerie and slowly dropped 
the covers. Maybe... maybe it wouldn&#39;t be such a bad thing...

      Carmilla started to crawl on the bed, staring at Tsuru with a gentler smile. &quot;If 
things had gone my way... we would have done this a long time ago.&quot; She reached over and ran 
a hand down Tsuru&#39;s cheek. &quot;Then again... if I had forced you to become a vampire, I would 
have destroyed the wonderful girl I now love.&quot;

      Then she kissed her. Tsuru relaxed under the vampire&#39;s cool touch and didn&#39;t resist as 
she was pushed down to the bed. Carmilla hovered over her, gently kissing her neck and 
grazing it with her fangs. &quot;Even if your blood is disgusting... I&#39;m sure will work it out.&quot;

      &quot;Uh... huh...&quot; Tsuru murmured as Carmilla&#39;s hand went under her shirt to touch her 
breasts. They were kissing again when a knock came at that door. Both ignored it and 
continued their kissing. Once it became harder, Carmilla pulled away.

      &quot;Just... hold on a second,&quot; she whispered to Tsuru, obviously not pleased with the 
insistent knocking on the door. The vampire got up with a huff, opening the door without any 
embarrassment about her state of undress.

      Hoshi looked taken aback, but after flitting her eyes over Carmilla&#39;s shoulder to 
Tsuru, she soon caught on. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I wanted to bring Tsuru these cookies as a little 
snack, that&#39;s all.&quot;

      &quot;Hmph, I bet you were just trying to see if she was alone so you could jump her with 
her sisters. Too bad, I&#39;m going to be her only lover!&quot; Carmilla said triumphantly, taking 
the tray of cookies nonetheless. If nothing else, she could tease Tsuru with them...

      Hoshi just smiled, but didn&#39;t deny it. Carmilla felt a sudden shiver go down her back. 
The vampire never actually thought that the sisters would... She took a peek down the 
hallway and saw Hina and Tsuki standing off to the side.

      The brunette came over to Carmilla with a glass of milk and Hina gave her a napkin. 
&quot;Big sister forgot these,&quot; Tsuki said.

      &quot;Yep, we just came to drop them off,&quot; Hina said, smiling.

      The vampire looked at all three of them and quickly shut the door. She set down the 
tray, milk and napkin, trying to wrap her mind around what just happened. All of her worst 
fears were true! The sisters really were trying to get Tsuru!

      Carmilla sighed happily, knowing that she had their little &#39;mistress&#39; all to herself. 
She straddled Tsuru, intending to pick up from where they started until she noticed how 
relaxed the young woman seemed with her eyes closed and her breathing steady...

      Tsuru had fallen asleep. The vampire shook her lightly, but only got a groan as the 
ebony haired woman turned over. Carmilla bit her lip to keep a frustrated yell from 
exploding. She had Tsuru all to herself and willing, but... Hoshi...! She just had to knock 
the door!

      Carmilla got off of Tsuru and lied down next to her. The vampire stared upon her 
sleeping face. Tsuru was quite beautiful when she slept... so Carmilla decided to settle of 
the next best thing and curl up next to her soon to be lover.

      It would be alright - they had all the time in the world. Not to mention... Tsuru 
still had to take her on a date! 

***** 

      The three sisters were walking down the hall to their own separate rooms when Tsuki 
asked, &quot;Big sister? Why did we have to tease our mistress like that?&quot;

      &quot;Well,&quot; Hoshi started. &quot;If we rile up our mistress and make Carmilla jealous, that 
should push their relationship along, right?&quot;

      &quot;Yeah! And it&#39;s funny to see the look on mistress&#39;s face when we do stuff like that,&quot; 
Hina added.

      Tsuki just let out a long sigh. &quot;B... but it&#39;s kind of weird... I mean, what if she 
starts liking us instead of Carmilla?&quot;

      Hoshi paused for a moment. &quot;Then we&#39;ll... just deal with it as it comes.&quot;

      Hina pouted. &quot;I don&#39;t think big sister would be too upset with that.&quot; Hoshi just gave 
her a confused look. &quot;You were the one who was touching mistress &#39;down there&#39; in the bath,&quot; 
the blonde girl continued.

      The eldest sister let out a slight cough. &quot;As I said, we&#39;re doing it to help her... 
and she is really cute when embarrassed.&quot;

      Tsuki just gave them looks of disbelief before letting out a long sigh. &quot;I... don&#39;t 
know how we&#39;re going to make this work...&quot;

      Hoshi sighed as well. &quot;There&#39;s nothing to worry about. Whatever happens, happens. I 
won&#39;t force anything.&quot;

      Tsuki nodded and headed off to her room. Hina pouted again. &quot;Does this mean the three 
of us are never going to...?&quot;

      Hoshi flushed bright red. Hina&#39;s bluntness kept catching her off guard. &quot;Someday, 
Hina. Tsuki needs time and... I need time too.&quot;

      &quot;... I didn&#39;t see you taking time with mistress.&quot;

      Hoshi laughed and started guiding Hina to her room. &quot;Are you getting jealous?&quot; Hina 
said nothing in response.

      &quot;Good night,&quot; Hoshi murmured, leaving Hina&#39;s room after tucking the girl in. Instead 
of returning to her own room, she stepped outside to look at the night sky.

      Without any lights on, the stars shone brightly, with a hint of the moon in sight. 
Hoshi feared her sisters would turn away from her the moment they got home, but... they had 
been able to return to some sense of normalcy and even tease their mistress in the process.

      Maybe she and her sisters weren&#39;t exactly as close as she had hoped, but for Hoshi, it 
was the first time in a long time that she was genuinely happy. With a sigh, she went back 
inside, preparing for a good night&#39;s rest, free of all the worries she used to bear.
