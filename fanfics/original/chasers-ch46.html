<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 46 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/chasers-ch45.html">Back to Part 45</a><pre>Lt. Jessica Storm sighed to herself softly, the tall
redhead adjusting her uniform unconsciously as she
strode down the hallways of police headquarters. It
felt good being out of Lowtown, considering the months
she had been stationed there, but she wouldn&#39;t have
chosen this method of leaving.

In the aftermath of the New Years bombing Lowtown had
risen up, the downtrodden masses that lived and worked
all their lives in the dark finally striking back.
City facilities, stores, police, nothing had been safe
from the rioters, and in the aftermath the city had
been forced to rescue the surviving officers.

&#39;Glad I wasn&#39;t one of the ones needing a rescue,&#39;
Jessie mused. During the chaos of that night she had
called for help, and luckily had reached a surface
police station. The officer on duty had advised them
to hold up rather than engage the rioters, and while
Jessie initially had argued she now understood that
order had likely saved their lives.

Jessie paused, checking the directions on the wall,
&#39;Which is part of why I&#39;m here.&#39; Turning a corner she
saw a door, labeled with the official sounding title
to the unity, then underneath painted on, &#39;The
Chasers.&#39;

The door swished aside softly, then Jessie blinked as
stepped into the corridor while a women yelled out a
warning, &quot;Incoming!&quot;

What looked like a naked woman scampered down the
hallway, breasts bouncing perkily as she chirped, &quot;How
can I serve you?&quot;

&quot;What the hell?&quot; Jessie blinked as she nimbly dodged
the nude girl&#39;s attempt to grab her, then carefully
clamped a arm around the android in a submission hold.

&quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; the android blinked meekly.

A lanky, light brown haired older woman hurried up,
dressed not in a uniform but casual pants, a ragged
old T-shirt and a battered police issue jacket.
:&quot;Thanks,&quot; she bent to help with the nude android,
&quot;out computer expert is trying to fix her.&quot;

&quot;Is she a logic burnout?&quot; Jessie asked as they led the
now submissive android into the section of police
headquarters designated for the Chasers.

&quot;No.&quot; the other woman said sourly, &quot;someone hacked her
subroutines.&quot;

Jessie nodded as they entered a computer center the
likes of which she had never seen. A standard police
computer core might involve two hard drives, several
monitors and a basic interface jack, this, on the
other hand, had at least four drives, a holographic
core display, multiple peripherals and what almost
looked like grey market hacking gear.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Jessie said weakly.

&quot;You found her, Kate,&quot; the much smaller redheaded
woman trotted out from behind the computers, &quot;thanks.&quot;

&quot;Kate?&quot; Jessie echoed, looking at her in surprise.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kate said as she passed the now mostly docile
android over to the lady, &quot;Kate Williams, you wanna
make something of it?&quot;

&quot;Actually, I came out here to say thank you,&quot; Jessie
admitted.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Kate blinked.

&quot;Beth, Kate, I finished the filing,&quot; another brown
haired woman said as she entered the room, her long
brown hair and gentle eyes almost making her seem like
a softer version of Kate.

&quot;Thanks Naru.&quot; Beth smile.

&quot;Jessie?&quot; Naru stopped, looking at the officer in
surprise.

&quot;Ah, hi Naru,&quot; Jessie fought back a blush.

&quot;You two know each other?&quot; Kate raised an eyebrow,
looking more than a bit amused by both their
reactions.

Naru smiled, eyes twinkling with amusement, &quot;You could
say that.&quot;

&quot;Anyway,&quot; Jessie shook herself, &quot;I came down here to
thank you for your help, Officer Williams.&quot;

Kate looked skeptical, &quot;Considering I&#39;m pretty sure
we&#39;ve never met, I&#39;m not sure how I could have helped
you.&quot;

Jessie smiled apologetically, &quot;The radio connection
was pretty bad, but you were the only officer I could
reach during the bombings.&quot;

Kate&#39;s eyes widened slightly, &quot;The unit trapped in
Lowtown.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Jessie nodded, pleased Kate had remembered.

&quot;I&#39;m sure someone will explain it eventually,&quot; Beth
murmured, both her and Naru listening to the
conversation eagerly.

&quot;I was stationed in a Lowtown station when the riots
hit,&quot; Jessie simplified, &quot;thanks to some good advice
from Kate, we made it out mostly unharmed.&quot;

&quot;Unlike most of the units who were down there,&quot; Naru
noted quietly, looking at Jessie with some concern.

&quot;Do you want to help me get our little lost lamb back
to the repair bay?&quot; Beth asked Naru as she kept a firm
grip on the still nude android, &quot;I guess I&#39;ll have to
try debugging her again.&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Naru agreed, taking the other arm as they
walked off.

&quot;Well,&quot; Kate said a bit gruffly, &quot;you&#39;re welcome. You
and your people were okay?&quot;

&quot;We lost our chief in a sidewalk collapse while making
it back to the station after the first blasts,&quot; Jessie
said with regret, &quot;other than that, we were all
right.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Kate nodded.

&quot;Son of a fricking...&quot; a loud voice cursed as a door
slammed shut, making both women react warily.

&quot;Julie?&quot; Kate blinked as the dark haired woman stormed
into the computer lab.

&quot;Gwen is passing me over for a full time position,&quot;
Julie growled, brown eyes flashing, &quot;how dare she...&quot;

&quot;Officer,&quot; the new voice cut across the room like a
whip crack. The Asian woman stood in the doorway, her
very presence seeming to send out cold waves of force
as she said, &quot;I was trying to keep this between us,
but if you want to discuss it publicly?&quot;

Julie stiffened a bit, &quot;No, ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Gwen purred, &quot;you&#39;re relieved for the rest of
today. Please let me know if you&#39;re interested in
continuing as a computer tech as well.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; a visibly deflated Julie said as she
left.

&quot;That was uncomfortable,&quot; Kate calmly noted. She ran a
hand through her short messy hair as she addressed
Gwen, &quot;I guess she heard about the opening before you
could break it to her that she wasn&#39;t getting it?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Gwen sighed. She looked over at Jessie,
&quot;And you are...?&quot;

Jessie stood straight as she said, &quot;Lt. Jessica Storm,
ma&#39;am.&quot;

&quot;Lt. Storm,&quot; Gwen nodded. A smile tugged on her lips,
&quot;You&#39;re on my interview list for candidates, aren&#39;t
you?&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Jessie acknowledged.

&quot;Well, since my interview with Julie took much less
time than I thought,&quot; Gwen said briskly, &quot;why don&#39;t we
have your&#39;s now?&quot;

&quot;Certainly, ma&#39;am,&quot; Jessie agreed promptly.

&quot;It&#39;s Gwen,&quot; she said as she led her down as hall
lined with office doors, &quot;or if your must, Commander
Musashi.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jessie hesitated, &quot;Gwen.&quot;

&quot;Better,&quot; Gwen agreed as she lead the other woman into
her still open office.

To be continued...

Note: Jessica Storm made a cameo appearance in chapter
forty one.
