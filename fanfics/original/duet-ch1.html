<h1>Duet (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mrasmussen.html">David Rasmussen</a><br> </h2>
<pre>It was a balmy Spring evening. Crystal was taking a sip of her glass of
beer when she noticed him off in the distance. Her upstairs neighbor was
trying desperately to give her the latest gossip, but Crystal was tuning
her out now. Her husband had just gotten off work and was fast
approaching their one bedroom apartment.

She hadn&#39;t even started cooking dinner yet. Spending the whole day
chit-chatting with her neighbor on the porch. Having fun. Mike wasn&#39;t
going to like this. He was sure to be upset. He&#39;d start drinking some
liquor, if he hadn&#39;t already, and an argument between the two would
surely follow.

Crystal noticed the brown paper bag in her husband&#39;s hand. He&#39;d already
started drinking. That was okay, she was on her sixth beer as well. She
was prepared.

Whether it was balmy, or cool and misty, or raining cats &amp; dogs didn&#39;t
matter to her. Janice leaned against the alleyway wall and sighed. Her
informant was feigned here and there with useless jibber just to avoid
talking about what Janice needed to hear at that moment. She only had an
hour to go before her planned date and she had to hurry.

Unless Crystal forgot again and ditches on her. But she promised to show
up this time so maybe it&#39;ll happen. After all their last several dates
were charming so maybe she wasn&#39;t too busy tonight to get together.

Now if this little snitch would just stop yammering and tell her
something useful.

&quot;Here comes Mike.&quot; Crystal interrupts her neighbor abruptly.

&quot;Where?&quot; Her neighbor Sylvia inquires, as she gazes over the hedges
blocking her view. A smile forms on her lips. She knew Mike hated coming
home to his wife running her mouth with her neighbor. Especially if the
apartment was in disarray and dinner wasn&#39;t even cooked. &quot;I&#39;d better get
ready to go upstairs. My boyfriend will be home soon too. And I haven&#39;t
even started cooking yet.&quot; Sylvia states as she heads for the stairs.

&quot;Alright! Alright!&quot; The snitch hands off a DVD to Janice, his hand
shaking.

He usually does that when he thinks Janice is going to beat him.

&quot;The little shit is actually selling these out on the internet?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Yeah. It&#39;s sorta like those DVDs you see on TV, y&#39;know?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Nice title on this one too. &#39;Spring Rape 2002&#39;. Buy it now and
catch your least favorite 20-30 year old men with pharmacy licenses drug
and bang high school girls. Yeah, right. no wonder they&#39;re calling this
fucking pervert the DVD Rapist.&quot;

(puts DVD into pouch) &quot;Hope this gets the guy a nasty gorilla for a
bunkmate in prison for a long time..&quot; (watch beeps) &quot;.damn. Here.&quot; (pulls
money out and gives it over) &quot;It&#39;s all here. I can&#39;t stay, I have to
change.&quot;

&quot;Date again?&quot;

&quot;.&quot; (looks peeved) &quot;.you should try it sometimes.&quot; (turns to leave)
&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll be less a pain in the ass if you had someone else other
than me to talk to.&quot;

&quot;Hi Mike.&quot; Sylvia greets Crystal&#39;s husband as he reaches the ground level
porch.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Mike allows as he enters his apartment, ignoring his own wife.

&quot;See you tomorrow.&quot; Crystal waves at Sylvia, then follows her husband

through the balcony door, closing and locking it behind her.

There is a fifteen minute to twenty minute moment of silence, until
Crystal decides to speak. &quot;You don&#39;t have a greeting for me? Your own
wife?&quot; She asks sarcastically.

&quot;Hey.&quot; Mike mumbles as he heads for the kitchen. &quot;No dinner tonight, or
what?&quot; He asks. &quot;I didn&#39;t have time to start cooking yet Mike.&quot; Crystal
lies.

&quot;You didn&#39;t have time? Maybe if you didn&#39;t spend so much time with your
little nosey friend, you&#39;d have time.&quot; Mike starts after taking a swig
from the half full bottle of whiskey. &quot;I&#39;m not in the mood for this
tonight Mike!&quot; Crystal retaliates, raising her voice.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s too damn bad. Cause it&#39;s on!&quot; Mike responds.

&quot;All this work I do to keep this house in order, and you don&#39;t appreciate
it!&quot; She retorts. &quot;All what work? There are dirty clothes strewn all over
the place. The dishes from last night haven&#39;t even been washed. I bet the
bathroom isn&#39;t even clean. And I don&#39;t even have a warm dinner to come
home to after a hard day of working for eight hours!&quot; Mike yells.

&quot;It&#39;s all about you, isn&#39;t it! What about me. I take care of all the
bills! &quot; She begins. &quot;With my money. You don&#39;t work!&quot; Mike interrupts.
&quot;But all you do is work! What about me? What about my needs? When was the
last time we even made love?!?&quot; Crystal raises her voice as she heads for
the fridge to get another beer.

&#39;Damn place is always full of the weird ones!&#39; Janice grumbles under her
breath, drawing a few sips from her drink as she sat and looked about in
disdain.

She would never have walked into the karaoke bar if it wasn&#39;t for two
things.

One being related to work, the second to her few month old lovelife which
was rekindled by the strangest of women she ever met. But then again love
is strange.

Janice sighed, fidgeting with her clothes for the twentieth time.

Didn&#39;t have time to go back to her place and change into something more
feminine. She never liked feeling so frilly and weird in a dress though,
but when she wore one for Crystal she liked dresses alot. otherwise she
would never touch the things on principal alone. She adjusted her top
again and tried to decide whether having less or more of her shirt
buttons open was appropriate. That&#39;s when an old friend spoke up.

&quot;On another date?&quot;

Janice frowned and turned to face the old cop. &quot;On another break? Don&#39;t
you have some crooks to arrest or something?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m off duty. Just passing through to work the crowd while waiting for
Lisa.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t believe the two of you met in this joint.&quot; Janice shot
half-heartily, pulling up a chair next to her for her old friend to sit
down in. &quot;What did the two of you sing again? I can&#39;t remember.&quot;

&quot;It was Linkin&#39; Park&#39;s &quot;In The End&quot;. though it didn&#39;t end for us, or you
either for that matter it seems.&quot;

&quot;Some of us is just more stubborn against rejection, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;So don&#39;t be shy.&quot; (he motions for a drink) &quot;How did you first meet this
love of your life?&quot;

Janice leans back and sips her own drink (soda) that&#39;s she had been
nursing for half an hour now. &quot;You remember half of it. drunk rapist? Me
with a bounty to cash in, and there he was sittin&#39; pretty. So I wrap him
up and vam! There she was.she was just sitting there all lonely and sad.
Couldn&#39;t figure out what she was so mopey about at first. Couldn&#39;t figure
that out for a few months in fact. though recently she&#39;s been giving me a
good idea what she&#39;s been so moody about. Though I think she&#39;s lying to
me.&quot;

Picks up her pouch and hands off something to cop. &quot;Here&#39;s the evidence
you&#39;ll need. Uncut raw footage of all the rapes. Thinks there&#39;s enough to
convict.&quot; (turns to face bartender) &quot;HEY! Masaki! I&#39;m going to look for
her, if she shows up make sure she waits for me to get back, OK?&quot;

The bartender nods as Janice heads for the door.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot;

&quot;She lives nearby, so maybe I&#39;ll breeze by her apartment and see if she&#39;s
home or not. She lives alone so she&#39;s probably just working on her
computer and forgot the date.&quot;

&quot;Made love?&quot; Mike grows annoyed. &quot;Ain&#39;t no love making going on, cause
you&#39;re too busy fucking everybody else in the neighborhood!&quot; He lashes
out.

&quot;I know you ain&#39;t talking about nobody cheating on anyone in this
relationship! What about your little whore Yvette? You keep forgetting to
mention her trifling ass!&quot; Crystal spews as she pours the beer into her
glass.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about Crystal!&quot; Mike feigns.

&quot;Yes you do! What about that time I showed up on your job and saw you
leading her ho ass out the backway of the store?&quot; Crystal manages.
&quot;Thought I didn&#39;t see that, didn&#39;t you?&quot; She continues.

&quot;And you think I don&#39;t know about your little boyfriend from up the
street? That little punk Roy. I see how you act whenever he&#39;s around. How
giddy and shit you become. What&#39;s that about?&quot; Mike inquires.

&quot;I&#39;m tired of this shit Mike! And I&#39;m sick of you taking me for granted!
All these years we&#39;ve been together and you never even gave me one damn
compliment! I&#39;m your wife dammit! Don&#39;t you think I deserve some kind of
respect?&quot; Crystal slowly changes the subject.

&quot;Well that&#39;s too damn bad. Maybe your hoeing ass don&#39;t deserve
compliments!

It&#39;s not like you fix yourself up or anything.&quot; Mike retorts.

&quot;Maybe if you&#39;d give me a little money to go to the beauty shop I could
fix

myself up. I think I deserve it. All the work I do around here.&quot; Crystal
says.

&quot;I don&#39;t see no work being done around here. Especially dinner being
cooked. Where&#39;s my dinner?&quot; Mike asks. &quot;Always you. It&#39;s always about
you. You are so damn selfish.&quot; Crystal finishes, as she sips her beer.
She then walks over to the television to

turn the sound up so that she can listen to the news.

&quot;Whatever. I just know I&#39;m tired of coming home to no hot cooked meal.

Is that so much to ask?&quot; Mike states. Crystal ignores him. She really is
tired tonight. Otherwise she&#39;d continue this sick, sadistic game the
couple tend to play on a nightly basis. Especially when pay day is just
around the corner.

Crystal then takes a moment to wonder why she continues to put up with
this nonsense. Why not get out of this crazy relationship, and move on.

What type of hold does this man have on her? She cannot answer.

Officer Johnson, about to go off duty, finds Janice about a half hour
later, leaning against a light pole near a couple of apartment buildings.
But when he gets close to her, he stops his squad car and looks on in
almost disbelief.

He&#39;s seen her in a lot of moods. Happy, sad, angry, pissy, confused,
jovial, and a whole lot of other emotions in between those emotions. But
she was different. She leaned against the pole almost white like a sheet,
sweat dripping down her face, her arms and legs trembling as she leaned
against the pole as if it was the only thing holding her up.

Her eyes were wide open in shock, her mouth half open, her expression
seemingly stuck as she just stood there with only the sound of her own
breathing bridging the silence between herself and him. Finally he got
out of his car, and walked up to her.

&quot;You OK? Janice.?&quot; (Nothing. Not a sound.) &quot;Janice?&quot;

After a few long seconds she slumps her shoulder, lowers her head, and
proceeds to &#39;shake it off&#39; (as it were). In a minute she had shaken the
sweat from her brow, and regathered enough strength to pull herself off
the light pole and towards him car.

&quot;Janice? What&#39;s going on?! Janice!&quot;

She opens a door, reaches in, and pulls out a pair of night vision
goggles.

&quot;Give me the rifle.&quot;

&quot;..wh--..? OH NO! No way!&quot; (he quickly moves to grab the keys from the
car&#39;s ignition before she grabs it) &quot;Your far too fucked up for that.&quot;

&quot;Give-ME-THE RIFLE!!&quot;

&quot;NO!&quot; (slams the passenger door shut to accentuate his point) &quot;What&#39;s
going on?! You look like hell! Did somebody.&quot;

&quot;I just. want. the damn rifle. I.&quot; (pushes away) &quot;Forget it! I&#39;ll borrow
the scopes though.&quot; He looks on as she walks off towards one of the
apartment buildings.

&quot;Janice what the hell is going.!!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t scream, dammit.&quot; Janice sighs, turning about. &quot;I&#39;m not going to
kill anyone. The scope just has a finer viewing range to it.&quot; Sighing,
she turns and walks on, leaving him behind her on the street looking
confused.

&quot;.this isn&#39;t really the time to take up voyeurism, you know.&quot; He remarks,
if only to himself.

Hours pass. Crystal is lying awake in bed after another fierce session of
raw unbridled sex with her husband. It was totally intense tonight. She
had three orgasms, at least. But why does she continue to play this
maniacal game? Why? She continues to ask herself. But, alas, there is no
true answer.

Or maybe her esteem is so low now that she is truly in denial. One thing
is for certain, she certainly needs a change. How do I go about making
that change? She asks herself, starting to fall asleep for the night.

Janice lies on the apartment building roof, dripping with sweat.

She brushed her fingers across her exposed breasts, feeling the softness
of her own flesh beneath her touch. The slight drip of her sweat on her
skin still detectable to the brush of fingertips on breasts. A slight
moan seeps through her lips as she pinches one of her still hardened
nipples. Dammit. She had to still be partially wired even now.

The binoculars lie to one side, her breath calm as she laid still
refusing to move.

&quot;Fucking idiot. I am. such. a fucking. idiot.&quot; she moaned softly.

She couldn&#39;t help but watch them make love.

Violent, aggressive, drunken near rape love. The shit they did both
excited and horrified her. Like picking up a violent porn flick because
the stuff both stimulated and sickened you at the same time, unable to
watch yet not strong enough to turn away.

Janice just didn&#39;t know what was worst. That she watched them, or felt so
fucked up for watching that she had to peep on all the neighbors just to
find someone making love she could relate to. Janice rolled onto her back
and reached down, feeling the last bits of her moment drying. She had
become so aggressively charged and angered by what she saw Crystal doing
that she watched a lesbian couple making love and cursed Crystal&#39;s name
over and over again until she came. But, still, at the same moment she
was crying for Crystal. wanting it to have been them making love before
her. and it frustrated her all the more and made her cry even harder as
her climax hit.

&quot;Why can&#39;t I ever be happy.&quot; Janice sighed, pulling herself slowly onto
her feet, dressing slowly before walking back to the stairwell and off
the roof.

As usual he was still there waiting for her.

Johnson took her home, and tried to talk to her on the way there.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; was all she said.

&quot;That&#39;s OK. I&#39;ll write it off as overtime. But what&#39;s.&quot;, no matter how
much he tried to find out, she would only say &quot;I&#39;m sorry&quot;. Eventually he
stopped asking and decided it was best to just let it go.

Back home, Janice picked up the phone and thought about it for a second.
maybe Crystal would pick up the phone, maybe he would, Janice finally
hung up.

&quot;Fuck it. The little bitch wants to play both sides of the fence she can
call me.&quot;

While sitting in the La Hacienda Karaoke bar Crystal takes a few puffs
from her cigarette. &#39;Where is she?&#39; She asks herself. &#39;She knows that we
always meet on Thursday nights. What&#39;s taking her so long tonight?&#39; She
continues to think to herself. Then a small smile comes across her thick,
full lips. She begins to remember when she first met Janice in this very
same bar.

It was early Spring, about two years ago. She had just had an arduous
bout with her husband Mike. But this time she was truly &quot;sick&quot; of it. She
needed a breath of fresh air. She got more than she bargained for. She
went out to the bar against Mike&#39;s wishes. She desperately needed to get
away from him. And though she had been drinking beer heavily throughout
that day, she still ordered some rum and coke that night at La Hacienda
anyway. And boy did that make her feel quite free and loose.

Not only did Crystal get up several times to sing, sometimes along with
others just for the hell of it, she was dancing and just plain enjoying
herself immensely. As she danced throughout the dimly lit bar, an
attractive, petite young woman stood by one of the barstools staring at
her. She was wearing a nice tomboy kind of ensemble, and looked like she
just went through a major workout before stopping in. She watched while
sipping a soda, her eyes fixated on her as she moved on the dance floor.

When Crystal noticed the woman, she went over to her and tried to lead
her onto the dance floor. &quot;Dance with me.&quot; Crystal begged.

Janice&#39;s eyebrows suddenly went up abit, and a puzzled expression crossed
her face. &quot;Well aren&#39;t you an upfront kind of girl. Are you sure you want
to? Not like the bar will tip over or anything if I stop leaning on it,
but still.&quot; Janice answered.

&quot;Of course.&quot; Crystal prodded, cooing as she did, &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Hey. No reason I can see, so why not.&quot; Janice replied, taking Crystal&#39;s
hand and leading her out onto the floor.

&quot;I&#39;m Crystal.&quot; Crystal allowed.

&quot;Janice Freemont. But just Janice is fine with me.&quot; Janice responded.

At first the dancing was quite playful and innocent. But as the night
went on, and the drinking increased (for Crystal at least, Janice stood
rather sober), their dancing became more intimate and sensual. Crystal
was entering territory she was not very familiar with. Her dance partner,
however, was quite adept at being with another woman.

But even she could feel the chemistry between the two. So why fight it?

Later that night they ended up at Janice&#39;s place.

The apartment was a strange mix of Anime geek and NRA member.

The apartment was made up with tapes (animes and VHS tapes of animes
recorded from TV) strewn all over shelves, mangas were piled on the
coffee table, a half cleaned (and disassembled) 9mm sat in a cabinet
Crystal saw half open, and various porn/rifle mags in a clothes hamper in
the bathroom (Crystal had to go bathroom while on her first visit).

Before they could reach her bedroom, they frantically ripped their
clothes off, as they embraced in a passionate kiss all the way to the
bedroom. Janice began by massaging and suckling Crystal&#39;s large &quot;C&quot; cup
sized breasts, savoring each taste of the girl&#39;s body as she did so. She
flicked her tongue in circles around her dark brown areollas. One, then
the other. She then began to lightly touch the tips of her nipples with
the tip of her tongue, nearly sending Crystal in a frenzy from the
anticipation.

&quot;I&#39;m not one for waking up in the morning to find my lovers screaming
bloody murder in my bathroom and crying like crazy, so are you sure you
want to do this?

Just want to make sure before the therapy bills show up in my mailbox.&quot;
Janice asked as she laid Crystal gently on her feather bed. &quot;I&#39;m quite
sure. Come here you!&quot; Crystal stated, as she began to ravish her partner
with wet kisses. &quot;Whoa!&quot; Janice sighed, letting Crystal take advantage of
her, &quot;Aren&#39;t you just frisky. I love that!&quot;

She started on her lips, and slowly began to move down her cheeks, her
neck and eventually to her medium sized breasts. Janice&#39;s nipples were
rock hard by now.

And they were craving Crystal&#39;s full lips, of which Crystal was willing
to oblige.

Janice then took over again, flipping Crystal onto the bed, as she got
back on top. She planted slow maddening kisses onto Crystal&#39;s trembling
body, starting at her pert nipples, then slowly and carefully moving down
her flat stomach and eventually towards her womanhood, which was already
wet with anticipation.

As Janice licked the sides of Crystal&#39;s dripping wet sex, Crystal arched
her back in ecstasy. She was moaning, trembling, and shaking all over.

And when Janice finally reached the dark skinned girl&#39;s clitoris, Crystal
could no longer contain herself, as she let out a loud yell and began to
orgasm and orgasm and orgasm, one right after the other leaving Janice
rather dumbfounded as she simply rubbed her face against the girl&#39;s clit
and licked her clean.

After resting momentarily, Crystal climbed on top of Janice, and followed
the same motions her new lover had done to her, eventually ending up at
Janice&#39;s soft pink sex. She was admittedly also wet from her excitement
and wasn&#39;t ashamed of it. This turned Crystal on all the more, driving
her to just dive right in, licking, sucking, and enjoying her first
lesbian experience to its fullest.

After Janice experienced a few orgasms of her own, both women fell onto
the bed in a heap, exhausted yet strong enough to cuddle each other as
they gasped for breath.

After resting for half an hour, they began to explore each others body
again, and again, and again, till the wee hours of the next morning.

Every touch, stroke, penetration and orgasm a liberating experience for
the both of them, leaving them locked into each other&#39;s arms content and
sated when the sun rose.

Crystal smiled from ear to ear remembering that beautiful night of true
passion.

That morning over breakfast she unintentionally swore her undying love
for Janice and started to see her more often. As she thought of her
feelings she became so lost in her reverie, that she doesn&#39;t even notice
Janice entering the karaoke bar until the younger woman is right up on
her.

Janice, for the first time in her life was seemingly half drunk, tears
streaming down her eyes and her face slightly bruised (her shoulders and
torso bruised abit), her clothes half miffed as she half sat, half fell
into the chair next to Crystal. She looked up at Crystal with tears in
her eyes. &quot;Why. why did you lie to me? You swore. you loved. me!&quot; (Fists
balls up, eyes shut as her tears flow abit harder, her legs giving out
beneath her as she falls face first into the bar worn out) &quot;Why. why
dammit. why.&quot;

Crystal and the bartender help Janice in the backroom.

Here&#39;s the story Janice related in quick form on the way to the back.

Janice started drinking after last night, just drank and drank and drank.

Then she made the unfortunate mistake of going after the DVD Rapist and
taking a beating before finally taking the bastard down and dragging him
to her friend in the police. The incident was nothing she couldn&#39;t
handle. until he caught her off guard and managed to beat her down. For a
few seconds he was on top of her beating her viciously, until he stopped
when he heard the strangest thing. laughter. He looked down, as she
pulled her arms away from her head, revealing her face, tear ridden and
maniacal.

She was looking right at him yet also through him as well.

With a scream she lashed out, catching his aside his head and bowling him
over. He quickly stood up and slammed his fist hard into her head. This
not only did not stop her, it made her madder, her features twisting as
her manical smile turned into a wicked grin that made his heart stop for
a second. Before he knew it she was beating him into the ground screaming
about a girl he never heard of, and sex he never had with an older woman
he never met. By the time she dragged him to the cops, he was a crying
wreck unable to talk much let alone complain.

When he was sent to the jail they asked if he wanted to sue Janice.

All he really wanted to do was crawl under a rock and disappear.

But that was then. When Janice was beating him she saw only Crystal&#39;s
man. Every venomous word and angry punch was at him, and when he hit her
she imagined Crystal and her spiteful pig of a man she was strapped to
for some reason.

Janice was angry. Angry at him, angry at Crystal, angry at herself.

The DVD Rapist was just in her way, and didn&#39;t know it.

But now, that she was this close to Crystal, the beating didn&#39;t hurt as
much as her heart was hurting. As she was being lead to the backroom, the
bruises didn&#39;t mean as much as having Crystal so close, and thinking of
her making love to that man. tears welled up again as Janice cried
bitterly, finally falling into Crystal&#39;s arms and hugging her tight as
the girl sat down and held Janice in her arms, bruised and weeping
softly.

Crystal starts the conversation, her arms wrapped firmly around Janice
holding her tightly to herself. Janice just told Crystal some of what was
said above. but enough.

&quot;Is that what happened to you Jan? You look like shit.&quot; Crystal begins.

&quot;I got bushwhacked.&quot; (chuckles abit) &quot;.nice compliment by the way, so it
figures I look awful.. but what do you care!&quot; Janice sneers between sobs.

&quot;What do you mean? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Crystal continues.

&quot;My job first off. Somebody had to take that rapist down. Second, I just
needed to vent.&quot; (eyes go abit distant as she talks, staring at an object
only she can see)

&quot;I saw you. I saw you with him...last night.&quot; Janice manages.

&quot;Him? Who?&quot; Crystal feigns knowledge of whom Janice speaks.

Janice turns to look with a hurt expression in her eyes. &quot;My informants
can&#39;t even get away with that dumb as lead routine, so your out of luck.&quot;
(sighs) &quot;You know who! Who else?! Who do you think I&#39;m talking about?! Or
do you want the dirty details?&quot;

&quot;Mike? My husband? Why are.&quot;

&quot;YOUR HUSBAND?!?&quot; (Janice tries to roll out of Crystal&#39;s arms only to
wince) &quot;Whoa.&quot; (teeth clenched as she rolls back, grasping her side as
she does) &quot;.won&#39;t try that again for a few minutes at least.&quot;

Crystal sighs now. &quot;Why are you tripping about me and Mike being
together?

He&#39;s my husband.&quot; Crystal chuckles as she places a condescending hand
upon her lover&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Oh. Wondrous. He&#39;s your husband.&quot; (Janice
sighs) &quot;This might seem like an obvious remarks and all, but you
shouldn&#39;t promised a lonely single lesbian that she&#39;ll be the only one
for you, then go home to a husband.&quot; (grabs forehead with free hand as if
she&#39;s experiencing a stress headache) &quot;You told me he was your roommate
and you hated that man and only stood with him because he pays all the
bills, at least until you can afford to stand on your own two feet.&quot;
Janice states. &quot;Of course I tried to tell you that I can do all that for
you, but you always had to divert the subject. Damn you.&quot;

&quot;Well yeah, but he is my husband. And though I may hate him with
conviction,

I still have obligations as his wife. So why are you so bent out of shape
over this?

You knew the situation when you and I first started seeing each other.&quot;
Crystal becomes annoyed. But to this Janice sneered, making Crystal&#39;s
expression freeze as she saw how truly riled Janice had become. The
usually mellow girl was now in full meltdown mode.

&quot;BULLSHIT!&quot; Janice yells, teeth still clenched, &quot;You told me what you
wanted to tell me, not the whole truth! Why didn&#39;t you tell me
everything?! And besides, how long were you going to continue dragging me
along like some sort of mistress! Huh? When were you and I ever going to
have OUR &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; ending and truly be together without his
shadow always looming between us??&quot; Janice spits out, letting her anger
go all at once, tears flowing as she let go.

&quot;Soon my darling, real soon. I promise you.&quot; Crystal says, placing a
light kiss upon her lover&#39;s bruised lips which felt soft despite the
bruises. &quot;Stop letting this situation upset you so. I told you that
you&#39;re the only one I love. Why can&#39;t you believe that?&quot;

&quot;I want to.&quot; (hugs Crystal with her free arm, dragging her other arm
around her) &quot;Goddess I want to. dear goddess I just want you, nothing
else. but it hurts. it just hurts a lot to be without you for so long.&quot;
(catches her breath and kisses Crystal back)

&quot;I do love you.&quot; (stops, blushes, and lies her head back in Crystal&#39;s
lap) &quot;I&#39;m sorry for getting mad at you. If I have to be patient and wait
forever for you, I will.&quot; (sighs) &quot;Y&#39;know, this is exactly how CLAMP got
Tomoyo screwed when they finished Card Captor Sakura. She probably vowed
to wait for Sakura forever too and look what it got her in the end.&quot;
Janice sighs, sinking into Crystal&#39;s embrace. &quot;Wonder if anyone&#39;ll start
a website dedicated to love stories about us? Goddess, I hope not.
couldn&#39;t take it.&quot;

&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you tell me all about it at your place.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna watch the last episode of. oh. you mean that.&quot; (Janice
stands up, rubs off the kinks in her muscles while picking up a wash
towel). &quot;I&#39;m going to clean off the make-up and we&#39;ll go. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll
have my second wind when we get there and the bed&#39;s all made and all.&quot;

&quot;MAKE UP?!? Janice, you.&quot;

&quot;Well you didn&#39;t think I&#39;d let a rapist beat me down, did you? Sheesh!
(some of the story was true, I&#39;m just not relating which parts).&quot; Crystal
sighed, snagging the towel from Janice as she did. With a few spits on
it, she starts rubbing Janice&#39;s face.

&quot;But the look on your face when I told that story was priceless! I mean.
HEY!! Easy on the face, your really going to bruise it at this rate.
OUCH!!&quot;

&quot;Just makeup, huh?&quot; Crystal frowned, tapping Janice&#39;s side.

&quot;So he got a few lucky shots in. easy! No need to be so pokey. ouch!!&quot;

Crystal smiles, and finishes the job as she takes the younger woman&#39;s
hand, and leads her out to her car while not touching her sensitive
spots.

&quot;We&#39;ll take my car.&quot; Crystal orders.

&quot;No problem. I don&#39;t really have a car. I just loan one for dates because
I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d be charmed with the thought of riding on my bike at
100mph.&quot;

They embrace and begin kissing erotically while leaning on Crystal&#39;s
burgundy 1990 Toyota Corolla. Janice wraps her left leg around Crystal,
and squeezes her tightly, never wanting to let her go. When the two women
finally get into the car, Crystal breaks all types of speed limits to get
the two to her lover&#39;s one bedroom apartment twenty minutes away. And
before long, they arrive to her moderate home.

As the sun rose, Crystal touched Janice&#39;s forehead, watching the other
girl slumbering in her arms. Both of them were in her bed naked, and had
worn themselves out after a long night of bliss. But still, as Crystal
gently brushed her fingers across Janice&#39;s forehead, she wondered what
was keeping her from living this life with her.

Slowly the other girl woke up, first bleary eyed, then more chipper as
her wits came about. She rubbed her head against Crystal&#39;s breasts as she
began to smile. &quot;Thought you were going to run off before I woke up.&quot;

&quot;Mike can wait. He won&#39;t be home until later after fucking his ho.&quot;

&quot;.&quot; (blank expression) &quot;.you do realize that I haven&#39;t a clue what you
just said, but I&#39;ll take it a ho is not something good.&quot; (rolls over, and
reaches over into her dresser) &quot;Don&#39;t peek, and don&#39;t swallow, or.&quot;

&quot;Or.?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to pump your stomach, and that&#39;ll just ruin the romantic
moment.&quot; Janice rolls back over and smiles, leaning forward to kiss a now
rather gunshy Crystal. As their lips meet, Janice uses her fingers to
wiggle Crystal&#39;s lips open, and presses in firmly as she kisses the other
girl on the lips. A few seconds later she breaks the kiss, leaving
Crystal confused. And leans forward abit and opens her mouth, allowing
what was inside to fall into her waiting hand. In her hand, a gold ring
with a diamond heart.

&quot;I just wanted to give you something. as a sign of my commitment to wait
for you no matter how long it takes.&quot; (holds up second ring, with a black
opal heart set into the ring) &quot;I got myself a counterpart ring, so I can
remind myself of my commitment.&quot; (puts the ring on) &quot;I look at it and it
reminds me of the heart I&#39;m waiting for. and maybe my ring will remind
you of the heart waiting for you down the road.&quot; (smiles) &quot;That and I
picked up some more adult stuff for our private little toy box but you
don&#39;t get to play with those until we&#39;re an item!&quot; (jumps off the bed)
&quot;Now I&#39;m going to get dressed and cook up breakfast.&quot; (Janice lingers for
a few seconds before reaching back for Crystal and kissing her again) &quot;I
hope I don&#39;t have to wait long. but I&#39;ll wait as long as I have to, if
only to wake up every morning with you at my side.&quot; (smiles as she grabs
her clothes (set out last night) and disappears out the bedroom door).
Crystal holds the ring up and looks at it, putting it on for breakfast.
But after she leaves she takes it off again, and lets her thoughts mull
over the ring all the way back to her apartment.
