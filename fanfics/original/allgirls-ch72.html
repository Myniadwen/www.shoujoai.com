<h1>All Girls School (part 72 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch71.html">Back to Part 71</a><pre>&quot;A Real Party&quot;

Gabrielle had the good sense to call her father and tell him she&#39;d be 
staying in a hotel that night, and when morning came&#151;after she and 
Lilian shared a shower together, naturally&#151;she called him again. Making 
sure that Lilian was well out of earshot, she whispered for him to 
prepare the &quot;special plans&quot;. He got an earful as his daughter let out a 
shriek, but being tackle-hugged by her mostly-naked girlfriend did that 
sort of thing.

The two were glowing as they left the hotel and called for a cab (of 
course, they weren&#39;t so foolish as to not bring a change of clothes with 
them, although the style was questionable). They grinned and shamelessly 
held hands&#151;or smooched&#151;on the ride back to Gabrielle&#39;s house. Lilian 
jabbered about how eager she was to finally get out on her own, to find 
a job, an apartment, and maybe a certain redheaded apron-loving roommate 
along the way!

The cab took them there quickly and coldly; they got out, Lilian 
wondering what sorts of things Gabrielle had in store for her. Her 
birthday had been sour, but the events after that more than made up for 
it. She began to feel giddy as she approached the two-story house, and 
let her face show it. Gabrielle hugged her from behind and &quot;guided&quot; her 
inside. Lilian opened the door...

&quot;SURPRISE!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!&quot;

And was stunned to see all of Gabrielle&#39;s friends, plus a few from Miss 
Madsen&#39;s class, gathered there blowing noisemakers and screaming merrily 
at her. She stood there for awhile, overwhelmed with happiness, and 
could barely register being given a paper hat with the words &quot;Birthday 
Girl&quot; on it, let alone everything that was going on. Gabrielle beamed 
and squeezed her beloved&#39;s arm.

&quot;Ya told me ya never had a real party, so I got all me friends around to 
throw ya one. I hope ya don&#39;t mind it bein&#39; a day late.&quot; Lilian was 
overcome; she wept a little and drew Gabrielle into a deep embrace, 
kissing her and whispering her love. Victoria walked up to the two 
lovebirds, smiling and brandishing a noisemaker.

&quot;Come on, there&#39;ll be more time for that later. We need to take pictures 
first!&quot;

&quot;I think we should play games!&quot;

&quot;No, let&#39;s EAT!&quot;

&quot;I say let&#39;s open presents!&quot;

&quot;Guys, guys, come on!&quot; Gabrielle exclaimed. &quot;Don&#39;t overwhelm the poor 
woman. It&#39;s her party; let her do things her way. So whaddya wanna do 
first, Lil?&quot; she asked, staring with impish green eyes. Lilian smiled 
and looked around: at the childish games set up, at the decorations and 
presents piled neatly, at the food and the marvelous cake, and the 
guests there, all for her. She sighed as eighteen years of joyless 
living tumbled off her shoulders.

&quot;Um...I would like to play games first!&quot;

&quot;Sweet!&quot; exclaimed Blake, who had been put in charge of entertainment. 
&quot;Then you&#39;ll want to come with me!&quot; She took Lilian by the hand to the 
main game room, and the others followed.

Most of the games Blake set up were for kids, but she figured if Lilian 
was going to have an actual party, she may as well see to it that the 
young woman had fun, even if it did seem silly. Lilian loved it, though: 
she must&#39;ve played &quot;Pin the tail on the donkey&quot; more times than anything 
else, probably because she secretly liked being dizzy. There was also a 
game that involved people bobbing in a small pool for cheap prizes; this 
game got a wet reception.

There was a great big Wheel of Fortune, and on each of the small slots 
was a crazy thing somebody had to do, such as whirl around in circles 
until they fell, or do a hoedown. There was a game where helium balloons 
were thrown in the air, and whoever could pop the most at the end of a 
minute won a good prize (Lilian and Zane were the victors). There were 
racing games held outside, dancing contests held within, and even a 
little bit of nonsexual Truth or Dare.

Lilian didn&#39;t really want to stop&#151;she laughed so hard that sometimes it 
was difficult to breathe&#151;but she didn&#39;t want to be impolite to her 
guests, and so asked to be led towards the food. With streamers, 
glow-in-the-dark jewels, and confetti and sparkles decorating her 
clothes and body, Lilian looked more like a party girl than some sullen 
antisocial creature. She was beaming and having the time of her life; 
Gabrielle was falling deeper in love with her, if it was possible.

Nobody could make or buy anything fancy&#151;they had spent all their money 
on the cake and presents&#151;but cheese cubes, crackers, and little sausages 
wrapped in biscuits were excellent for any occasion. The girls dove in 
and sat around the large kitchen table, which the O&#39;Shannon parents had 
so kindly donated (they actually snuck out once the guest of honor 
approached), chatting and socializing mindlessly for at least an hour. 
Lilian wanted to be with everybody and not monopolize Gabrielle to 
herself, but that was difficult since the redhead, armed with a paper 
party hat and several crazy straws she had won, was perched comfortably 
on her girlfriend&#39;s lap.

When Victoria brought out the cake&#151;naturally, a German chocolate 
cake&#151;and the ice cream (a large tub of Neapolitan) everyone made a 
little scene. She set it down and had the distinct honor of planting and 
lighting the two candles, a 1 and an 8. Then of course, everybody 
crowded around and sang to Lilian, who was crying for the joy of it all.

Gl&uuml;cklich Geburtstag zu ihr

Gl&uuml;cklich Geburtstag zu ihr

Gl&uuml;cklich Geburtstag lieber Lilian,

Gl&uuml;cklich Geburtstag zu ihr

&quot;Not too bad,&quot; said Lilian gracefully, &quot;although your pronunciation 
could use some work. And I don&#39;t quite think you translated it 
accurately, but I love it all the same.&quot;

&quot;That makes us feel better,&quot; Janine muttered. Everyone laughed, and 
Olivia snapped a photo as Lilian blew out her candles and made a wish. 
Being the birthday girl, she got the first chunk of the cake.

Lilian stared at the small heap of presents and, not for the last time 
that day, grinned affectionately. Everyone had brought something, even 
those people she didn&#39;t feel very close to! She wanted to relish opening 
every single one and thanking the kind soul that had given it to her, 
but she realized everyone had other things to do, and they had been kind 
enough to stay that long. She devoured the presents gracefully, thanking 
everyone with brevity, and made sure to dispose of the trash. Mostly she 
received nice novelty items, like a few movies or CDs, and a toy or two 
had been snuck in by some of the more playful girls. One got her a nice 
sweater; &quot;somebody&quot; had been daring and slipped a pale blue bikini 
inside...along with an apron.

&quot;What?&quot; cawed Gabrielle, staring down a roomful of accusatory eyes. 
&quot;What? I can&#39;t give my girlfriend a bikini? Where does it say I can&#39;t do 
that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a little...unusual,&quot; Janine admitted. Lilian smiled, though her 
reaction to opening that gift was entertaining, to say the least.

&quot;I like it,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I will wear it when I invite all of you 
over to my house for a poll party.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no way!&quot;

&quot;You got a pool at your house?&quot;

&quot;Ja, an indoor one.&quot;

&quot;Sweet!&quot;

&quot;That is so cool!&quot;

&quot;You rock, Lil!&quot; She laughed as the girls cheered her on, and since 
every formality had been taken that day, she yearned to return to the 
games. A few girls left for home, their schedules a mess, but a 
few&#151;Gabrielle&#39;s main core of buddies&#151;stayed behind the whole day, and 
well into the night. Gabrielle&#39;s parents returned just before evening, 
and offered to make Lilian dinner, but she declined politely.

&quot;You have been kind enough to me to last the rest of my life. I could 
not trouble you further. Besides, I am stuffed from lunch still.&quot;

&quot;All right, but don&#39;t be shy.&quot;

......

Before anybody could turn in for the night, they had to agree to clean 
up the great mess their party had made. There were just enough girls, 
all of them high on sugar from the cake, to get the job done quickly 
(Lilian had to insist several times to help, even though Gabrielle 
assured her it wasn&#39;t necessary); they were in their sleeping clothes, 
and some in bed, just around ten that evening. School would be starting 
soon, so they all needed to readjust themselves to waking up early. 
Lilian, of course, shared a bed with her girlfriend.

&quot;Mmm, my sweet,&quot; she sighed, leaning down to kiss the dear girl. 
Gabrielle let out a soft little coo as the young woman&#39;s pale lips 
gently touched her neck; she could still smell that extravagant aroma of 
the ballroom, of Nachtheim fortune, that perfume that perhaps caused her 
to be so amorous. Its potency hadn&#39;t diminished at all; rather, it was 
stronger still.

&quot;Lily, my sweet,&quot; whispered Gabrielle as mouths, tongues, and skin 
meshed. She found Lilian&#39;s hands wandering, lifting her humble white 
shirt off, eagerly propping her legs up so she could slide off her 
underwear... Gabrielle grinned, chewing on her lower lip to keep from 
squealing, and was delighted to a show as Lilian shucked off her shirt 
(silver hair tossing like shards of grass in the moonlight) and wiggled 
quite seductively from her panties. The young woman purred with lust and 
put her mouth to Gabrielle&#39;s jaw, her hands to her reddish crotch; 
Gabrielle hoped her moans of ecstasy would be muffled, as many of her 
friends were sleeping in rooms very close to her own.

She hoped she was up to the task. She and Lilian made love to each other 
like sex-starved bunnies, and only stopped because it became physically 
impossible for them to move.

Morning was quiet and cold, but Gabrielle had a warm, beautiful, naked 
woman as her blanket. She woke up first as the dim light of winter broke 
through and touched her face, and smiled with deep, serene love as the 
girl of her dreams slept on, the light giving her an ethereal glow. She 
hugged the woman gently, not wishing to disturb such a beauty&#151;unless 
perhaps with a kiss&#151;and ran her hand over Lilian&#39;s white back, totally 
at peace.

Then she noticed the door was open, and panicked, her facial expression 
priceless, as she noticed all four of her closest friends standing 
there, arms crossed and eyes hot. She chuckled nervously and waved with 
her free hand.

&quot;Uh...hi, guys! Top of the mornin&#39; to ya!&quot;

&quot;Hello, Gabrielle,&quot; said Olivia with sweet sharpness. &quot;You&#39;re looking 
well this morning. Had a good night&#39;s sleep?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you seem quite relaxed!&quot; said Janine, more snarky than usual. 
&quot;Almost as if you spent a good deal of energy last night.&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on, gimme a break!&quot; she wailed. Blake laughed.

&quot;And when were you going to tell us that you and Lil were sleeping 
together? I&#39;m insulted! I thought we were all close friends! And here 
you are, the first to be de-flowered, and none of us knew about it!&quot;

&quot;Um, actually...&quot; murmured Victoria, but she went ignored.

&quot;Come on, cut me some slack!&quot; managed the poor redhead. &quot;It was just two 
days ago, the night of her birthday! It&#39;s only our second time!&quot;

&quot;Excuses, excuses. You had plenty of chances to tell us during the 
party, hotshot!&quot;

&quot;I...I didn&#39;t want to embarrass her,&quot; she whimpered. Victoria cleared 
her throat.

&quot;Uh, pardon me, please. Um...Gabrielle&#39;s not the first in our circle to, 
uh, have slept with a girl.&quot;

&quot;Say WHAT?!?!&quot; Everyone shouted at once, their faces bright red. &quot;You 
mean you and June? And you didn&#39;t tell us either?! How long ago was 
this? Vicki, Gab...are you two in cahoots together? Is this a 
conspiracy?!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot; wailed the youngest, &quot;I meant to tell you but the time 
never came up! We&#39;ve been sleeping together for awhile...&quot;

&quot;You dog!&quot; spat Olivia, giving her friend a slap on the shoulder. &quot;So 
you finally scored with that girl, huh? Amazing! I never thought you 
would be the first to lose her virginity! And with June, no less!&quot;

&quot;I know; I always figured it&#39;d be Gab or me,&quot; said Janine. Meanwhile, 
poor Gabrielle was fretting. Lilian was beginning to stir and her 
friends weren&#39;t getting any quieter.

&quot;Guys, come on!&quot; she hissed. &quot;Keep the noise down! It&#39;s bad enough that 
yer all in here when&#151;hello?&#151;Lilian and I are clearly naked!&quot;

&quot;Oh, relax, we&#39;ve all seen your goods.&quot;

&quot;But I&#39;m in my bed, with my girlfriend!&quot; she spat. That was the last 
straw&#151;Lilian finally woke up, murmuring softly, and smiled as her 
beautiful crimson eyes focused on her lover. Gabrielle mustered up a 
grin...and then disaster broke out as Lilian too noticed their company. 
Victoria wished she had brought her camera in: two priceless looks in 
one day!

&quot;Get out!!&quot; screamed the albino, hastily throwing covers over herself. 
&quot;Get out now! Give us some privacy at least!&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, we&#39;re going. Just don&#39;t stay too long&#151;we&#39;ve got 
lots to talk about, Miss O&#39;Shannon!&quot; The foursome left the room, but it 
didn&#39;t make things much better. Both girls sighed wearily, one looking 
worse for the wear.

&quot;God, what maroons!&quot; sighed the redhead. &quot;Saints preserve us all! ...My 
friends,&quot; she attempted as an excuse/apology. Lilian chuckled darkly.

&quot;Ja, they can be a handful. It&#39;s clear they care for you, though.&quot;

&quot;I guess. We better not keep them waiting, huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; sang the albino, snuggling further underneath the 
covers. &quot;We could certainly keep them waiting...a little longer!&quot; 
Gabrielle laughed as her lover tickled her naked skin...and then moaned 
in pleasure as she&#151;

&quot;ARE YOU HAVING SEX RIGHT NOW, GABRIELLE?!&quot;

&quot;Get a life, you jerks!&quot; she spat back. She and Lilian stared at each 
other, burst out laughing, and got dressed at long last.

......

The girls showed much more charity towards the two newly-christened 
lovers as they finally emerged and sat down for breakfast. There were 
kind, supportive smiles all around, apologies made and offenses 
forgiven, even though Gabrielle was still a little annoyed.

&quot;Ya didn&#39;t have to be such pissy little pigs about it,&quot; she murmured, 
drinking orange juice. &quot;You acted like the world stopped turnin&#39;. 
There&#39;s nothin&#39; unusual to what we done, and you girls knew it was 
inevitable anyway.&quot;

&quot;We know,&quot; said Janine, smiling happily. &quot;We were just a little 
surprised, that&#39;s all. Sorry for barging into your room like that.&quot;

&quot;Bah.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re really happy for you,&quot; said Blake, reaching out to touch 
Gabrielle&#39;s hand. She nodded at Lilian and added, &quot;Both of you. You make 
such a cute couple!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry also,&quot; said Victoria. &quot;Even though my sexual life is nobody&#39;s 
business, I should have informed you all.&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re right, we&#39;ve no business knowing.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; said Gabrielle evenly. &quot;But from now on, would ya not make 
such a big deal about it?&quot;

&quot;I think your first sexual experience would count as being a big deal,&quot; 
reasoned Olivia. Even Lilian had to agree with that.

.........

&quot;And that&#39;s what happened,&quot; concluded O&#39;Shannon, before an audience of 
her classmates. &quot;Suffice to say we needed to edit some stuff, 
but...uh...you all got imaginations!&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; whispered Madsen, &quot;and I think they&#39;ve been tested to their 
limit. Well, thank you both anyway. It seems we&#39;ve still got some time 
left before class ends, so I&#39;d like to give some homework. Now now,&quot; she 
chided amidst groans, &quot;you&#39;ve had long enough to enjoy your freedom. 
It&#39;s back to business as usual for us all, and I won&#39;t let a little 
thing like the first day of the new semester to get in our way.&quot;</pre>
