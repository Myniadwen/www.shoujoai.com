<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Cathy glanced up at Kris several times as they descended the dorm&#39;s back 
stairs to the cafeteria, &quot;So... are you really a Sister of Death?&quot; She 
inquired hastily. 

Kris glanced down at the girl in shock, &quot;Where did you hear that?&quot; She 
asked, defensively. 

Cathy jumped at the raise in Kris&#39;s voice, &quot;It&#39;s what everyone is 
talking about since school let out.&quot; She stated nervously, &quot;I think it 
is cool is all.&quot; 

Kris nervously ran a hand through her hair, &quot;Everyone is talking about 
it?&quot; She asked with a sigh. 

Cathy nodded, &quot;That and about that girl who died, that really weird red 
haired one.&quot; 

Kris stopped mid-step and turned to face the girl, &quot;That girl was a 
friend of mine.&quot; Kris snarled, &quot;Her name was Kimberly and she was not 
weird, she helped many of the girls here, including a close friend of 
mine, so she deserves some respect.&quot; 

Cathy shrunk against the stairwell wall, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Her eyes 
were huge and she began to tremble, &quot;I didn&#39;t know... I just heard Kelly 
talking... she is not happy about any of this.&quot; 

Kris forced herself to calm down, &quot;Kelly? Who is she?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s the head of one of the gangs here.&quot; Cathy informed, &quot;She got into 
a lot of fights and with the Head Mistresses, and Jessica, away she 
thinks she can take over the dorm.&quot; 
					
Kris rubbed at her temples, &quot;Great... and I have to deal with her little 
rebellion. Is that right?&quot; She asked miserably.

Cathy nodded, &quot;I thought you would like to know before it got out of 
hand.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like it is already out of hand.&quot; Kris noted as she continued 
down the stairs, &quot;This is turning out to be a very long day.&quot; 

Kris pushed through the doors to the cafeteria and allowed them to bang 
open, in hopes that the sound would gain the attention of the crowd of 
girls that were milling about inside. The effect worked and now she had 
the eyes of a good portion of the girl&#39;s upon her. She glanced around 
the crowd in search of the troublemakers when a girl approached her. 

&quot;Are you Kris?&quot; The girl said worriedly. 

Kris simply nodded and a mummer filled the crowd. 

&quot;So the Death Angel appears.&quot; A voice called out from behind a group of 
girls, which suddenly parted to make way for a tough looking girl 
holding a large knife. 

&quot;I&#39;m guessing you are Kelly, am I right?&quot; Kris inquired, quickly sizing 
up the girl while keeping a close eye on that knife. She knew her Aunts 
reasoning behind allowing some of the kids to bare weapons were just, 
but at that moment she wished they were not armed. The idea was to train 
a few willing students in the art of battling the creatures from the 
Western Woods, in case one of them wondered onto the school grounds. The 
rule was that they could carry only bladed weapons and would not be 
allowed to use them against any of the other students, or they would 
have their weapons confiscated and they would be removed from weapon&#39;s 
training, in serious cases the girl would be suspended or forced off the 
school grounds. In all the years that Kris had visited the school she 
had only heard of a few occasions in which the Head Mistresses needed to 
suspend a student, however at that moment Kris had a feeling that the 
Western Dorms was about to have a few empty rooms by the end of the day. 
Kelly twirled her knife between her fingers in a manner that Kris 
thought was supposed to be impressive, but after seeing Natalie in a 
fight she found it rather pathetic, but kept that to herself. 

&quot;Is it true that you really are a Sister of Death?&quot; Kelly inquired, 
sitting on the corner of a table. 

Kris let out a deep sigh and glanced around at the many eyes upon her. 
Girls had encircled her and now blocked every exit out of the cafeteria, 
if she was to get out of this she was going to have to play by their 
rules for a bit it would seem, &quot;Yes.&quot; She said boldly, &quot;I was formerly 
known as Aigneis, Sister of Childhood Death and Daughter of The 
Meanderer, that is until they banished me.&quot; She decided to get the 
formalities over with and everything out in the open, but carefully left 
out the bit about her being stripped of her powers. Maybe if they 
thought she still had her powers they would listen to her and stop with 
their foolishness. 

Kelly leaned forward, &quot;Prove it.&quot; She hissed. 

Kris sighed again, in the crowd she could see Cathy watching her 
intently, &quot;Fine.&quot; She agreed, &quot;If I do will you all return to your rooms 
and work on your studies.&quot; 

Kelly laughed, &quot;I don&#39;t think you are in the position to give orders.&quot; 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t an order.&quot; Kris remarked, &quot;It was a request.&quot; 

&quot;Well then, I request you prove to us why we should listen to you.&quot; 
Kelly reiterated. 

Kris took a deep breath and lightly touched the stone that dangled 
around her neck. The Malith stone that her brother had only recently 
given had lost most of its power after she battle with her sister, 
Carey, but she could feel a small trickle of energy emitting from it. 
When she first put the necklace around her neck she could feel a heavy 
flow of energy like that of the waters of the wild rapids and now it 
felt no more then the size of a tiny stream, but all the same it was 
more then enough power to prove to these girls that she was indeed a 
Death Angel. She spread her hand out to her sides and closed her eyes as 
large wings spread out behind her. The wings did not hold the same 
majestic quality that they used to have, and were partly transparent, 
but it still caused the crowd to fill with the mixed sounds of gasps and 
mumbling as they gazed up at them, &quot;Is that enough for you?&quot; Kris asked 
with a triumphant smile upon her face as she watched several girls back 
away from her. 

&quot;The Lords...&quot; Kelly breathed, &quot;You really are one of them.&quot; She got up 
from her seat and stepped closer to Kris, &quot;One of your sisters took my 
parents from me.&quot; She snarled, &quot;Took them when I was only three years 
old. What do you have to say about that?&quot; She asked holding the point of 
the knife towards Kris in hostility. 

Kris&#39;s wings began to fade, but she felt strength from them, &quot;Sisters do 
not take, they guide those who have departed onto the next world. If you 
have a problem with that then I suggest you take it up with the Lords. 
You can find them through the Western Woods.&quot; She pointed out the patio 
window towards the dark woods that surrounded them. 

&quot;Do you think I&#39;m stupid?&quot; Kelly asked with a slight chuckle, &quot;I know 
what is in those woods and there is no way you are going to talk me into 
entering there. Instead I&#39;m going to repay you for the grief your 
sisters put me through.&quot; 

Kris stepped up to the girl and for the first time Kelly realized just 
how tall Kris was as she towered half a foot over the girl and glowered 
down at her, &quot;You have no idea what grief is until you have been a 
Sister of Death. Have you any idea how many friends I have buried or the 
fact that I was forbidden to ever love anyone? Then when I finally find 
someone to live for they are taken away from me and I&#39;m forced to live 
here with you, tossed aside like some piece of trash. So don&#39;t try given 
me some sob story about how losing your family turned you into some kind 
of badass girl, because frankly I don&#39;t give a shit about you or your 
family. I was asked to be Head of these Dorms because my Aunts thought 
it would do me some good. Why? Because I am the one who tore the wings 
off my own sister after she tried to kill the girl I loved and guess 
what? I still have a bit more aggression left in me and you have just 
volunteered yourself to be my punching bag, that is unless I see your 
ass moving out of this room as quickly as those shaky legs of yours can 
move. It is up to you, do you really want to have a fight with Death?&quot; 

Kelly nervously licked at her lips, she glanced around to find her 
friends were no longer behind her and she was facing Kris on her own. 
Cautiously she sidestepped around Kris until she was closer to the 
cafeteria exit, &quot;Y... you better watch yourself...&quot; Kelly warned, 
shakily holding the knife out towards Kris.

Kris bared her teeth, &quot;You are the one who should watch herself. I don&#39;t 
need a knife to make me feel brave.&quot; She stated, pointing at the knife, 
her hand suddenly a blaze with blue flames, &quot;Now MOVE!!&quot; She suddenly 
shouted causing many of the girls to jump and file out of the room. 

When the room was empty Kris knocked several trays off the closest table 
and let out an anguished cry of frustration. She could feel anger 
coursing through ever part of her body and she punched a table, breaking 
it in two and then kicking on of the pieces across the room to come 
crashing down upon another table at the far end of the room, thirty 
metres away, sending trays and food flying across the room. She panted 
as she felt her anger slowly begin to dispel and suddenly regretted her 
actions. Her rage finally dissipating she knelt down and picked up one 
of the many trays that lay upon the floor and began to clean up the mess 
around her. 

She heard the sliding patio door open and quickly stood to her feet, 
prepared to throw the trays at whomever entered if she needed too. She 
quickly calmed herself as she saw Misty enter the room along with Tanya, 
Cherilyn, Emily and Natalie. 

&quot;Geez, what happened here?&quot; Misty inquired as she stared at the piece of 
table teetering atop another and then spotted Kris, &quot;Hey! You alright?&quot; 
She asked worriedly.

Kris dropped the trays she held upon another table and ran her hands 
frantically through her hair, &quot;I&#39;ll be fine. I just had to deal with a 
small rebellion is all.&quot; 

Natalie glanced around at the mess as she stepped over several trays and 
chairs, &quot;Kelly I&#39;m guessing, am I right?&quot; She remarked, and blinked at 
the scorch marks along the break in the table, &quot;Did you do that?&quot; She 
asked pointing at the table. 

Kris slowly nodded, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I did not realize I still retained some 
of my strength.&quot; She said in embarrassment, &quot;I don&#39;t know what that girl 
thinks she is doing, but she has something coming to her if she thinks 
she can scare me.&quot; She stated coldly. 

&quot;She&#39;s just a bully.&quot; Misty remarked, staring at the broken table in 
amazement, &quot;Jessica had to deal with her back when she first became dorm 
head as well.&quot; She explained as she picked up a chair and set it up 
properly. 

Kris sighed, &quot;I sent everyone to their rooms.&quot; She stated finally 
regaining her calm, &quot;I don&#39;t know if they will listen, but hopefully 
they will stay out of trouble until Aunt Sophia, Missy and Jessica 
returns.&quot; 

&quot;What happened to Melissa anyway?&quot; Emily inquired curiously. 

Kris shrugged, &quot;I have no clue, but Sophia mentioned that she is back, 
she is just resting.&quot;

Misty smiled, &quot;So she didn&#39;t leave us after all, that is great.&quot; 

Kris shook her head in dismay, &quot;I am not too sure about that. She could 
leave again at any moment so we should be careful not to ask to much of 
her for a little while yet.&quot; She suggested.

The girls all nodded in agreement. 

Natalie lifted the broken table off the other and collapsed the legs, 
&quot;Guess that leave us to clean up this place.&quot; 

With a mutter of concurrence the girls set about the task of cleaning 
the cafeteria.
