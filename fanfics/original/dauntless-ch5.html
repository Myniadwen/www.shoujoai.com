<p>“Let’s  Wrangle That Comet: our journey has finally begun.”</p>
<p>Kyrie  Lastgear might have fallen in love with Dr. Miracle if the mysterious  entity had possessed a physical body. What a fantastic display of  pyrotechnics! What a stunning mastery of ferocious heat and searing  flames! Miracle had been the living embodiment of fire, and Kyrie had  been the only one to embrace and accept the holocaust. What a pity  that Miracle was so secluded and domineering! Nobody else had  stricken so much wonder and hunger in Kyrie’s heart; she yearned to  find out just who or what this phantasm was, and how she could  imitate them. For the time being, though, she bathed in the serenity  of her room, lighting candles everywhere so she could be surrounded  by her element. She had to wonder just how much arson she could get  away with before Miracle kicked her off the ship!</p>
<p>Best  to put her skills to practical use. In spite of her burning passion,  Kyrie was an inventor and a scientist first and foremost, and  although wanton destruction gave her a thrill, nothing good ever came  out of it in the long run. The <em>Dauntless</em> was currently on the outer fringes of the Strategos system, appearing  to wander aimlessly through the vast ocean of stars. Kyrie was  curious about the ship’s propulsion system and wondered just how  Miracle proposed they explore the galaxy so speedily. It had been six  centuries since the people of Helios 3 first broke the virginity of  the heavens and a lot of advancements in space travel had been made  since then, but few reasonable people could honestly say they could  explore the galaxy at will with any sort of haste (the Ozmund Company  being one of the elect).</p>
<p>Kyrie  abandoned her fiery sanctuary and explored the ship in search of  answers. It was homier than she expected; it didn’t have the  sterilized feel of military ships or the dull monotony of commercial  liners. Every square meter seemed custom-made to suit whatever taste  the passenger had. Indeed, it seemed as if the ship molded itself  just for Kyrie’s sake, like it had been designed, constructed, and  brought all the way here just for her. The walls were flickering with  red, orange, and yellow, and they were warm to the touch; the floor  waved with happy heat; the ceiling dripped embers. She blinked her  eyes and rubbed her face, and the <em>Dauntless</em> was the <em>Dauntless</em> again, no longer a paradise. Was this happening to everyone else, or  was Kyrie just special? She pressed on, more amazed with every step.</p>
<p>She  learned, by degrees, that the <em>Dauntless</em> had eighty guest rooms, with a furnished bathroom, closet, and  personal area for every passenger (although some had already chosen  roommates). There were also five public baths: two open shower areas,  a sauna, a large “open ceiling” hot spring that allowed the  bathers to look up into the heavens, and even a “cold” bath for  variety (Kyrie preferred molten lava). There was a gymnasium  fully-stocked with every conceivable method of exercise, a training  room, a fully-equipped laboratory, a data library meticulously  compiled, three entertainment rooms, a kitchen, a dining-room, twenty  storage rooms, a clinic, a garage, a communications room, the general  assembly room, a computer room, and even a room just for people who  wanted to relax in the company of others. Most of these spaces were  already occupied, but Kyrie wasn’t interested in them yet: she  wanted to see the engine room.</p>
<p>She  figured the best person to ask would be Amy, the doctor’s  assistant. She had been searching for the unassuming woman ever since  leaving her room, but she had played a vanishing trick and was  nowhere to be found. Kyrie then tried finding the engine on her own,  to no avail—but she gradually began to understand the layout of the  ship, and even learned that its surrealistic surroundings was not an  experience for her eyes only.</p>
<p>“You  must really like fire,” Shana giggled when Kyrie explained it to  her. She pressed her hand against the wall, caressed it, then leaned  her cheek against it. “Sometimes I see images that are too  beautiful for words. I can’t seem to paint them, though. It’s not  that I keep forgetting them, or that I’m unable to do the pictures  any justice, it’s just…I get the feeling I’ll kill it if I  paint what I see here. It’s different from drawing people or other  locations—you’re complimenting those facets of your life by  reproducing them according to your perspective.”</p>
<p>“So  maybe what you’re seeing here,” Kyrie said, knocking against the  wall, “is a perspective meant only for you, just as I’m seeing  the fire.”</p>
<p>“You’re  probably right,” Shana said. She moved away from the wall and  closed her eyes. “So it’s just for me. I almost feel unworthy,  and yet…whenever I want to, the ship will show me exactly what I  love, and only me. It must not want me to feel remorseful about this  honor.”</p>
<p>“So  maybe everyone else is the same,” Kyrie mused. It was certainly  something to think about at the very least. The <em>Dauntless</em> reformed itself into whatever the individual desired, lulling them  into comfort, all for the sake of their enjoyment. It was clear this  ship had been made in another galaxy—maybe even another  universe—but how did it get here, and more importantly, how did it  run?! Kyrie picked up the pace and resumed her search, but when lunch  came, she was no closer to her destination. She realized she would  have to ask Dr. Miracle or Amy, and went to the dining room in the  hopes that they would be here (but why should anyone else’s stomach  groan in synch with hers?).</p>
<p>Neither  of them were in sight—Miracle stood out like the sun and Amy was  easily identified by her ubiquitous cane—but she did see Herut and  Eve talking shop together, and if memory served correctly, these two  were particularly good at repairing and modifying machines. She  approached them politely and sat down, but Eve raised her guard and  became shy. She was far more comfortable around machines, and  although Herut was not entirely mechanical, she was as close as they  got.</p>
<p>“Sorry,  am I…interrupting anything?” Kyrie said.</p>
<p>“We’re  just sharing information,” Herut replied, a vague smile still on  her mouth. She had quickly made friends with Eve and looked up to her  as a superior mechanic.</p>
<p>“Oh.  I was just wondering about the engine, and I thought you two—“</p>
<p>“Don’t  even think about burning it down,” Eve warned her bluntly. “I’ve  got a good deal going here and I don’t need a destructive maniac  ruining it.”</p>
<p>“Look,  whatever Yenae told you isn’t true!” Kyrie squealed. “I may be  a pyro, but I’m not reckless! I just like to light the occasional  fire. I’m actually from a renowned family of inventors!”</p>
<p>“Oh  yeah, that’s right,” Eve mumbled: “the Lastgears. Yeah, I’ve  heard of you. Okay, I guess I understand why you’d want to check  out the engine.” Kyrie nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>“Ahuh,  ahuh! I’d love to see the propulsion schematics. Judging from our  current speed, we must be using a sub-Lennethium drive, but I  wouldn’t be surprised if we could go full throttle.”</p>
<p>“That’s  what we surmised as well,” Herut said. “However, we’ve been  unable to verify this, since the engine room remains elusive.”</p>
<p>“I  know, I’ve been looking for hours.”</p>
<p>“But  you can’t complain about the ambiance,” Eve indicated with a  grin. When she explored the ship, she had seen the interior of  countless devices on the walls—their workings, their designs, the  process to build them from scratch… Herut’s perspective was  nearly identical, except that she saw things from a more practical  point of view and Eve had a more artistic eye. One saw machines as a  function, the other saw them as fashion; no wonder they were already  friends.</p>
<p>“I  know, it’s almost eerie. Anyway, I hope we find the engine room  soon.” Herut suddenly jerked her head around and raised her middle  finger. Chandra was standing across the dining room, making ugly  faces at Herut, praying and hoping that she would leave the room  quickly.</p>
<p>“I’m  outta here,” she stated, leaving the rest of her meager meal  (artificial humans do not require the amounts of food normal humans  need). She scampered out the door in two seconds, presumably to renew  her search for the engine, leaving Chandra alone with her prey. She  sat down, coldly dumped the rest of Herut’s food, and sidled up  next to Eve, who couldn’t help but stiffen.</p>
<p>“Correct  me if I’m wrong, Eve dear,” she whispered seductively, “but I  heard you’re fond of machines. I don’t know why, but I think  that’s really sexy—maybe it’s because I belong to that little  family.”</p>
<p>“O-oh  yeah? W-well how about th-that.” Chandra giggled and trailed her  silky hand against Eve’s jaw; their eyes locked and her breath  became shallow. Since she was so unaccustomed to other people, Eve’s  sexual experiences were very limited. She was not a virgin, but one  could not say she was very experienced, either. And Chandra was by  far the most beautiful woman she had ever met. Kyrie’s skin was  already red, so she couldn’t really blush, but she could certainly  feel awkward.</p>
<p>“Uhh…should  I leave you two alone?”</p>
<p>“No,  don’t go!” Chandra exclaimed, reaching out to grasp her arm. Her  eyes sparkled with virginal desire, glowing green and lush and  bursting with life. “You’re so beautiful…your red skin is so  pretty…and you have the wings of an angel. Please don’t go.”  Kyrie hesitated for a few moments as she was drawn into that hypnotic  stare, and only just managed to escape.</p>
<p>“I’m  sorry! I have to! Sorry, Evie!” She sprinted away and returned to  her room, breathing heavily as the candles slowly massaged her  nerves. Kyrie had not been a crewmember long, so she didn’t know  who everyone was or what their abilities were—and thus, she didn’t  know that Chandra had been designed specifically for sexual  gratification—but she swore she would not be ignorant long. And the  first step out of ignorance, her dear mother had told her, is the  desire of knowledge.</p>
<p>“First  the engine room, then that woman,” she promised herself.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Aseria  was perhaps the only person onboard that had a prior connection to  Dr. Miracle (her half-sister Aria apparently knew and trusted the  enigmatic apparition), so Kyrie went to her next and asked her where  their patron was. Not even Aseria knew, but she did know where  Miracle’s assistant was. Amy was reading quietly in her room and  welcomed Kyrie very eagerly. She already knew about the Lastgear lust  for creation, and had actually wanted to place her in charge of the  engine. She was in no condition to walk, however, since the pain was  stabbing her sharply that day, but she did have enough energy to  explain how the <em>Dauntless</em> worked.</p>
<p>“As  you’ve guessed, Lennethium is one of its energy sources, but the  doctor doesn’t use that unless it’s necessary. Instead, the ship  relies on a combination of matter fusion, dark matter—a bit of  Lennethium—and teleportation, courtesy of Dr. Miracle. Matter  fusion is basically the process of breaking down waste and refuse and  using it as energy. In other words, the trash you throw out  contributes to our power. Dark matter, on the other hand, is  basically the energy produced by the heavens themselves. The <em>Dauntless</em> can absorb this energy into itself and store it as fuel. Lennethium,  as you no doubt know, is a rare mineral that can be used to greatly  exceed the speed of light. The Ozmund Company grew to power because  it discovered a way of synthetically reproducing this material, but  Dr. Miracle uses the genuine article.”</p>
<p>“What  about teleportation?” Kyrie squealed. She was slavering and almost  mad with glee. Not even Chandra could have seduced her like this.</p>
<p>“Well,  to put it simply, Miracle uses teleportation to transport one body of  matter into an empty space. Take this book: if Miracle moved it over  there, it would occupy that empty space, and then the space would  then occupy the area previously taken up by the book. Matter can only  be moved or changed; Miracle just uses this principle to take the <em>Dauntless</em> to distant places in an instant. Of course, even if an object the  size of a pea is already occupying that space, the results could  prove quite disastrous. Miracle must be very careful when  transporting objects like that…but you don’t have anything to  worry about!! My master is very efficient and has not yet made an  error. Even so, we only teleport when we need to cross long  distances.”</p>
<p>“I  see! So can you show me where the engine room is?! Oh, right, I  forgot.” She giggled bashfully and pointed to Amy’s foot. Blithe  smiled…well, blithely, and waved her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s  okay. I can just tell you. Remember the open-ceiling sauna? Starting  from there, head to the right and walk all the way down the hall.  Take a left, go to the second door on your left, and go down the  ladder you’ll find. That will take you to the engine room. Here.”  Amy handed Kyrie a key and made her promise to keep it safe. Of  course, Kyrie was really more worried about losing her way, but Amy  assured her that wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“After  all,” she said gaily, “that’s what we have Lyara Tanith for,  right?”</p>
<p>……</p>
<p><u>Record  of the voyage of the “Dauntless</u>”  (as composed by Alala)</p>
<p>Day  2 and people have already gotten the wrong impression about me.  Except for a small minority, the rest of them treat me like I’m a  sex-crazed airhead. I used to be angry at people when they said those  things, but I’m older and wiser now. They’ve been corrupted by  preconceived notions about the Felinis people, particularly the  residents of Tigris. They all assume we are nothing more than  “nymphomaniac cat-girls”, and because nobody’s ever enlightened  them, they keep perpetuating these ideas. That’s why I’m here—so  that somebody can set them straight!! But now I’ve become  emotional; I need to approach this rationally. First I have to make a  record about the people that have made the largest impressions on me,  and go from there. In no particular order…</p>
<p>Kate  Shepherd: muscle-bound fighter from Utopia, but she has strong  morals. Respects me.</p>
<p>Kay  and Tee Acheron: creepy.</p>
<p>Mink:  seems emotionally dead, but that blabbermouth master of hers says she  just isn’t very expressive. Quite loyal and actually rather nice. I  saw her smile at me once! It was so precious!</p>
<p>Athena  Sifr: doesn’t seem to like me or anyone else, except Fuuka. VERY  hardcore.</p>
<p>Shana  Suing: cute and sweet, but treats me like a kitty. A REALLY good  artist (but she made me look too cute! ARGH!).</p>
<p>Herut:  distant and unsociable, but she wasn’t programmed for interaction.</p>
<p>Fuuka  Fujiwara: I can tell she’s a very strong woman despite that  frailty. Utterly devoted to Athena (they’re so cute together!). A  magnificent doctor, but ironically, not in the best of health  herself. Respects me!</p>
<p>Sharyn:  can’t understand a word she says. Too self-assured. That little  robot of hers is annoying.</p>
<p>Riene  Latoli: a very smart woman, but quite bashful around the rest of us.  Seems worried about her weight, but I think she has a great figure.  Treats me like a kitten (blegh!).</p>
<p>Eve  Kasberry: uncomfortable around people. I don’t know much else.</p>
<p>Aseria  Tolan: kindhearted, but there’s definitely something twisted about  her. Insanely devoted to Lil for some odd reason. Wants to touch my  ears (no, stay away!).</p>
<p>Allegra  van Landingham: fun, but she’s got a dark side. Treats me like a  kitten.</p>
<p>Chandra:  STAY AWAY, ALALA! DON’T GO NEAR!</p>
<p>Kyrie  Lastgear: a wacky fun-loving girl who unfortunately treats me like a  kitten.</p>
<p>Lyara  Tanith: has quickly made friends with Shana. Treats me with great  respect (yay!).</p>
<p>Lillianne  Markus: jackass. Insanely protective of Aseria. Doesn’t like others  interacting with her much.</p>
<p>Vimmy  Fonester: makes even the most hyperactive Felinis seem meek and  timid, but at least she respects me. I don’t see how she and Mink  found each other.</p>
<p>Rebecca  Hill: a good person but VERY shy, especially when I’m around. I  think she’s afraid I’ll jump her in a frenzy.</p>
<p>Naja  Elapidae: jerk.</p>
<p>Yenae  Marliir: ARGH! She is your number one ENEMY on this ship, Alala! She  lives only to make you suffer! EVERYONE ELSE is NICE to you compared  to this prankster bitch! SHE NEVER STOPS TEASING ME UNLESS SHE’S  ASLEEP! She pulls my tail! She touches my ears! SHE EVEN PINCHED MY  CHEEKS and asked if “all the rumors about my species” were true!  What makes her think she can treat me like I’m a STEREOTYPE?! I  DON’T LIKE THIS WOMAN AT ALL! Ugh, she drives me nuts!! I just  wanna smash a cobbler in her face, just once! (Ahem!) I do have to  admit that she’s a very good leader, though, but whenever I’m  around…</p>
<p>Amy:  very sweet. I like her VERY much. She does NOT treat me like a kitten  and is probably the last person that ever would. Why can’t everyone  else be so nice?</p>
<p>Valti:  crazy mad scientist I wouldn’t want to be friends with. Afraid  she’ll pull my tail, or worse.</p>
<p>Dr.  Miracle: no comment.</p>
<p>Clearly  there are some people on this ship I need to make better acquaintance  with. Kate, Lyara, Mink, and Fuuka sound like a great start, and I’d  also like to get to know Rebecca (how could a bounty hunter be SHY,  anyway?). I’m glad I already made one friend so quickly…and maybe  if things keep up, Amy and I could go to the next level. I know I’m  being hypocritical when I say that (I mean, c’mon, I’m preaching  about being avant-garde, but I also have my urges), but she’s such  a great woman! I just wish I could do something to help her foot.  Fuuka is the best doctor I have ever seen (and I’ve seen some  excellent doctors), but even she can’t seem to fix it. I want to  ask her about it, but I don’t want to pry.</p>
<p>That  Yenae gave me a ball of yarn to play with, so I just threw it at her  head! But I kind of wanted it, too—not to play with, of course! I  mean, that’s just childish! I’ll make a nice scarf for Amy—just  as soon as I learn how to knit! I’ve got nothing but time on this  ship since we don’t seem to have any particular destination, so  maybe it’s time I picked up a hobby.</p>
<p>Damn  it, now she gave me a glass of milk! I wanted to splash it right in  her face, but mama told me NEVER waste anything. I drank it once she  was out of sight. I guess it tasted okay.</p>
<p>WHO  AM I KIDDING?! BEST MILK <u>EVER</u>!!</p>
<p>I  hate that woman. –<em>Alala</em></p>
<p>……</p>
<p>As  she completed her diagnostic of the ship’s crew, Alala emerged from  her room and made her way to Amy’s quarters. She tried not to stare  at her surroundings, and if she did, she pushed her desires away and  willed for the ship to present itself in its true form. Admittedly  this was a duller image, but it didn’t distract her from her goal.  Alala’s whitish ears perked up as she saw Fuuka walking ahead of  her, heading for Amy’s room, and she hurried her pace to catch up.  The woman smiled at her softly and nodded her head.</p>
<p>“Hello.  Are you well today?” Alala nodded proudly and flexed her arms.</p>
<p>“Yup,  healthy and strong!”</p>
<p>“That’s  good,” she giggled. “I’ve just finished my rounds and have  examined everyone. There were many people who did not feel  comfortable with my inspections, and some who were quite the  opposite.”</p>
<p>“I  know. This is a well-blended assortment here. I still can’t shake  the idea that something else is going on—you know, something to  justify the pretense of a treasure hunt. It sounds so ludicrous.”</p>
<p>“Like  something out of an anime,” Fuuka replied. Alala’s ears wiggled  in confusion, so she explained. “Anime is a branch of animation  exclusive to a country called Japan on Helios 3 that was quite  popular half a millennium ago. It’s…fairly obscure, I know, but I  enjoy it immensely. Some of their programs have people like us and  plots like the one we’re currently entangled with.”</p>
<p>“You’re  kidding!” Fuuka shook her head. “So it had things like Felinis  people on treasure hunts? That’s bizarre. I’m not accustomed to  televised programs—Tigris is sort of primitive in that aspect.”</p>
<p>“But  surely Mars had several stations.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  but I was too busy studying to watch any.”</p>
<p>“It  really is more like a hobby,” Fuuka admitted. They had already  approached the door and knocked their way inside. Amy was still  reclining on her couch, reading a book, and waved at them.</p>
<p>“Good  afternoon. How do you like the <em>Dauntless</em> so far?” Alala grinned.</p>
<p>“I  gotta hand it to ya, lady, it’s one hell of a ship! Where’d  Miracle get it, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Well,  it has been in my master’s family for a very long time. I do not  know where it was made, but I’m certain it comes from another  galaxy.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  cool! So hey, Fuuka here tells me you were hurt.” She nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s  usually not so bad. I hardly notice it unless the pain is  extraordinary. I had to use those crutches in the beginning, but  lately I’ve been getting along with just a cane.”</p>
<p>“Is  it true it never heals?” Alala was being a little too nosy, but the  receptionist didn’t mind: she loved that refreshing  inquisitiveness.</p>
<p>“Yes,  that’s true. I’m fortunate to have such a small wound, too.”</p>
<p>“I  wouldn’t call that <em>fortunate</em>,”  Alala murmured.</p>
<p>“She  means it could’ve been a lot worse,” Fuuka said as she tended to  the injury. In spite of her earlier efforts, the wound was still  fresh and still bleeding, and the only thing she could do was dress  the bandages and give Amy some painkiller.</p>
<p>“Oh.  Well, I guess you have a point. How’d you get it, anyway?”</p>
<p>“In  a fight.”</p>
<p>“A  fight?” Alala cast a quizzical expression Fuuka’s way; the  fox-girl just shrugged.</p>
<p>“She’s  teasing you. More than likely, she was bitten by an unfamiliar  reptilian animal. That’s my professional opinion, for what it’s  worth.” Alala pursed her lips and shook her head—but Amy’s eyes  had been too serious and too firm to be kidding. Just then, a small  cylindrical object that had been lying on a desk began to buzz, and  Amy picked it up with a smile.</p>
<p>“That  must be our pilots. Since the doctor can’t be disturbed right now,  I volunteered to handle any situation they might encounter. Yes?”</p>
<p>“Miss  Blithe, our current trajectory has caused us to approach a comet.  We’re safely out if its range, but one of our passengers felt it  was necessary to perform a more thorough investigation. With your  permission, we would like to tie her in chains, stuff her in a  closet, and forget she ever existed.”</p>
<p>“Tee,  you know that would not be—“</p>
<p>“Hey  doc, don’t listen to that two-headed cab driver! Let’s send a  couple of girls over and mine for materials! I’ve heard that comets  wield some of the most precious ores around! Some even have  Lennethium! Whaddya say, huh?!”</p>
<p>“Valti,  get your hands off that transmitter!”</p>
<p>“How  many do you want off?”</p>
<p>“ALL  of them!”</p>
<p>“Kay,  Tee,” Amy said to them, “if Miss Brignor wants to visit the  comet, she’s more than welcome to. As a matter of fact, that sounds  like a wonderful way to begin this voyage. Run parallel to its course  and prepare to fire a grappling rope.”</p>
<p>“What  do you mean? What will that accomplish?”</p>
<p>“For  an object that size, moving at that speed, landing on it with the  ship would be impractical. Dr. Miracle installed a few small shuttles  here that can slide along the rope. Valti, did you hear all that?”</p>
<p>“I  believe she has already gone to suit up,” Kay said.</p>
<p>“I  still can’t believe that six-armed freak wants to stop the voyage  just for her own personal gain,” Tee grumbled.</p>
<p>“Now-now,”  Amy tittered, “everyone here has the same rights. Soon we’ll find  a place you’ll want to see. I’m going to send two other people to  go with her. Keep me updated, all right?” Both twins sighed and  agreed to her request. They didn’t like the idea of stopping the  ship just for Valti’s selfishness, although it probably was a good  idea to stock up on materials. And they really had no right to say  what a person could and could not do.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Because  she had the most skill with machines—and because she was also an  accomplished shot—Eve Kasberry was given the honor of firing the  grappling rope, though she declined riding over there.</p>
<p>“It’ll  be so crowded,” she had replied stuffily, “and besides, somebody  has to stay behind and make sure nothing breaks.” Mining for  materials on a comet was not that appealing to very many people, but  Lillianne signed up with unprecedented enthusiasm, and nearly  convinced Aseria to go with her, which she nearly did. But at the  last minute, Yenae butted in and ruined everything, citing that the  journey sounded “fun”.</p>
<p>“I’ve  lived on a small planet all my life,” she explained, “so this  shouldn’t be any different. Ladies, I’m ready whenever you are.”  Lil snorted curtly and was in a foul mood for the rest of the trip.  She put the suit on roughly and glared daggers at Yenae as the three  women sat in the cramped shuttle together. Valti and Yenae had a  harder time putting their equipment on, since one had six arms and  the other had a tail, but they were used to adjusting their  accommodations, and were far too excited to complain in any case. The  shuttle ride was a little nerve-racking, even though the cable would  hold under the most intense pressure, and the transport hardly  weighed a thing in that feeble gravity—and even if did break, they  would just hover in space until a retrieval unit was sent. Once they  were close enough to the comet, Valti turned the engines off and let  gravity do the work for her.</p>
<p>“Thanks  for coming along with me,” she said to her companions. “I don’t  think I’d be able to gather as many materials by myself. Do either  of you have any experience with this?”</p>
<p>“I’m  an archaeologist by trade,” Lil grumbled, still feeling angry that  her dear Aseria had been supplanted.</p>
<p>“I  actually lived on a dwarf planet all my life, so it’ll be just like  home,” Yenae chimed in. Valti didn’t look very encouraged but  tried to smile.</p>
<p>“Well,  it’s the best I could hope for. Okay, we’re close enough to land.  I’m firing the retro-rockets.” The landing was fine—not great,  but good enough—and the three women cautiously made their way out  onto the comet, Valti landing first. “The truth is,” she  muttered, “even though I’ve done this sort of thing before, I’m  still a bundle of nerves. All right, the first thing we need to look  for is Lennethium. It’s a glowing pink ore that’s about the size  of your fist.” Valti played the part of director and cheerleader  quite well, and wasn’t afraid to get her hands dirty as she knelt  down and dug through the rubble in search of materials the crew could  use.</p>
<p>The  surface was not entirely stable, though, and sometimes it became  turbulent. Yenae said she was accustomed to walking around  planetoids, but even she almost lost her balance as the comet  shivered and shook. She joked that it must be a “comet-quake”,  and wished she could extend her tail for balance. A much more  powerful jolt sent her tumbling to the ground, slowly, and Lil went  with her, dropping a basket full of ore.</p>
<p>“Gods  damn it!” she shouted. She scrambled to retrieve the chunks of  comet she had excavated and climbed back to her feet, only to be  tossed again. “What the hell is wrong with this hunk of rock!? Hey,  Professor, you wanna get us killed?!”</p>
<p>“Don’t  blame me,” Valti retorted. “It’s just changing course. Comets  do that, you know.”</p>
<p>“Changing  course? Bullshit! This flying death-trap is breaking apart, and we’re  on it!”</p>
<p>“Then  we’d better hurry back,” Yenae said calmly. “Valti, let’s  just take what we can and return to the ship. It’s too dangerous to  stay.”</p>
<p>“And  here I thought you girls wanted action and excitement.”</p>
<p>“Not  at the cost of our lives, you idiot! Let’s go already!” Lil had  to fight in order to keep her balance as the comet gradually shifted  to the left. It was not following an elliptical orbit so much as  breaking free of one, hurtling towards a yet-unknown destination—more  than likely a destructive one.</p>
<p>“Acheron  sisters, do you read us?” Yenae spoke through the radio. “Do you  read? Oh good, listen: the comet’s changed orbit and we’re  heading in ahead of schedule. Get ready to bring us in once Valti’s  given the word. Pick up the pace, Professor! …I’m sorry, she’s  lagging. The damn fool still thinks this is a picnic. Any idea where  the comet’s headed?”</p>
<p>“We  probably shouldn’t tell you,” Kay replied. “It’ll cause a  panic. Just stay calm and approach the shuttle.”</p>
<p>“Kay,  I’m detecting another life force on the comet,” her sister  stated. “There are dozens of them. …Oh, shit.”</p>
<p>“What?”  Tee’s face turned red as she grimaced.</p>
<p>“I  accidentally transmitted that part. They heard everything.”</p>
<p>“Are  you sure? Captain Marliir, did you—“</p>
<p>“Life-forms,  we copy!” she exclaimed. “Valti spotted them first. Remember  Shana’s crack about Miracle not being a tentacle-monster? Guess who  makes up the welcoming committee down here.” Stomachs churned,  throats tightened, and lips pursed anxiously as one problem after  another surfaced. It would be cruel to add fuel to this fire, but…</p>
<p>“Captain,  Professor, Miss Markus, we may as well tell you where the comet’s  headed. The gravitational force of another body has started to pull  it, which would account for the instability you’ve been feeling.  It’s on a collision course.”</p>
<p>“What’s  the matter with you?!” they heard Lil scream—but her ranting  wasn’t aimed at them: they could hear her striking Valti. “Let’s  go explore a comet, you said! It’ll be fun, you said! We’d be  bringing supplies back, you said! There wouldn’t be any danger, you  said! I haven’t even been with this crew for a week and I’ve  already started to hate someone!”</p>
<p>“Stop  it, you two!” Yenae shouted—then, to the sisters, she said,  “Pardon us. I have to shut off the radio for awhile, but please  keep us informed. Hopefully we’ll make it out of here alive, if not  well.” Then came a disturbing silence, followed by a few agonizing  minutes of dreadful waiting. Would they keep fighting each other and  forget about their predicament, or would they band together, fight  off the approaching creature, and leave the comet before its doom?  Suddenly, the radio squawked back to life for a minute.</p>
<p>“—top  it, you’re squeezing my arm!”</p>
<p>“I  wouldn’t be hurting you if you just stopped fighting each other!”</p>
<p>“It’s  Valti’s fault to begin with! She led us here to this death-trap!”</p>
<p>“Nobody  forced you, Lil! Professor, will you <em>please</em> stop picking those up and hurry along! No—don’t <em>bring</em> those with you! Who knows what they’ll do to our ship!”</p>
<p>“But  this is the scientific opportunity of a lifetime! I’ll never get  this chance again!”</p>
<p>“Lil,  could you—ow! What are you hitting <em>me</em> for? I’m trying to settle this matter and save your sorry butts!  Valti! Put…those tentacle-creatures…DOWN!”</p>
<p>Kayleigh  and Teleah let out a deep, beleaguered sigh.</p>
<p>“They’re  doomed.”</p>
<p>“It  will be difficult finding replacements.”</p>
<p>“Rest  in peace, you all—we hardly knew ye.”</p>
<p>“We  can still hear you two!!” Lil shouted.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>As  Valti tried wrangling as many of the tentacle-beasts as she could,  balancing them and her swag with her six arms, Lil and Yenae fought  the rest off as they tried to clear a path. They could already see  the object their comet was going to smash into (the moon of a  distant, dead planet) and worked hard to avoid this deadly fate,  trying to stay calm in the midst of it. Lil’s cursing aside (every  syllable aimed directly at the absentminded Valti), they were slowly  making progress, even as the comet started bucking out of control.  Valti fell quite often, but she always seemed to have a spare hand  ready to spring herself back up—except for one time, when a long,  slithering mass snaked out of an opening in the ground, wrapping  around her waist and dragging her back to its lair.</p>
<p>“Hey,  look, I think we’ve disturbed the boss! Boy, think about the thesis  I could write on this sucker!”</p>
<p>“Is  she serious?” Lil balked. Yenae sighed.</p>
<p>“No,  just crazy. Come on, we’d better save the poor twit.” She didn’t  even make two paces before she realized she was on her own.</p>
<p>“Not  me, sister!” Lil shouted. “That bitch got herself into this mess,  so she can get herself out! You’ve got five minutes before I leave,  Yen! Use them wisely!”</p>
<p>“Hey,  get back here, you backstabbing…crap! No time to waste.” Yenae  hopped after the tentacle as quickly as the comet’s gravity  allowed, firing clumsily. She was the only one who thought of  bringing weapons, and as such, felt a little overwhelmed. But thank  goodness Valti was no helpless damsel: she was already attacking her  captor with the digging instruments she brought, even bashing it with  the sharpest ores. The tentacle fought back, though, slamming Valti  against the surface of the doomed comet until she nearly blacked out.  Luckily, this bought Yenae some time, and she closed the distance and  fired until she seared the tentacle in two. Valti wriggled away and  took hold of the smaller section of the beast.</p>
<p>“So  how much longer do we have before we crash, because I saw a nice vein  of pyrinthinide—“</p>
<p>“JUST  GO, YOU IDIOT!!” Yenae pushed the obstinate woman herself, and in  spite of the comet’s thrashing and spinning, she managed to thrust  Valti through the shuttle door and hurled herself in with fifty-two  seconds to spare. Lil didn’t even need to be told to leave.</p>
<p>“Wait,  you said we had 52 seconds? That’s more than enough time to grab a  few samp—“</p>
<p>“Shut  up!” they both screamed. Valti sighed forlornly, but there was  nothing she could do; she was outnumbered.</p>
<p>Valti  pretended like the past hour had been a casual vacation as she  carried her haul to her lab, taking special care of the severed  tentacle. Lil wanted to clobber her, but she chose rather to rush to  Aseria’s side and make sure she had remained unmolested. Yenae went  straight for the sauna and, finding she was alone, disrobed  completely and took her time washing. She especially celebrated the  release of her tail, and smacked the water with it until half the  room was drenched. As she got out and toweled off, humming happily to  herself, another crewmember crept in, wondering if anybody else was  there. Chandra’s timing couldn’t have been more perfect: Yenae  was completely nude and had her towel wrapped around her  peroxide-blonde hair, arms stretched up and chest prominent.</p>
<p>“Oh,”  purred the visitor, “it seems fortune has favored me today.”  Yenae looked confused.</p>
<p>“Dun-dun…dunn?”</p>
<p><em><u>Preview  of next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Chandra:  Darn, it cut off right when we were about to get to the good part!</p>
<p>Herut:  TRUST me, it’s for the best.</p>
<p>Chandra:  Don’t you have any romance?</p>
<p>Herut:  No, I’m a service and maintenance unit. We don’t <em>need</em> love.</p>
<p>Chandra:  Oh, how tragic! But in your case, kid, you deserve it.</p>
<p>Eve:  Hey, quit it! If you keep fighting like this, I’ll have to work  overtime!</p>
<p>Herut:  Sorry. I didn’t mean to tax you.</p>
<p>Chandra:  Mmm, and would you be “servicing” me as well?</p>
<p>Eve:  Uh…l-let’s just talk about what happens in the next chapter! The  crew arrives at their first real planet, and we all get out to  stretch our legs and search for riches.</p>
<p>Herut:  Yes, but there’s more to this world than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Chandra:  Oh, like beautiful women everywhere, lined up just for me?</p>
<p>Eve:  She’s pathetic.</p>
<p>Chandra:  You like it! Hee-hee-hee!</p>
<p>Herut:  Ugh, get a room, you two. Stay tuned for “Sargasso: set sail for  adventure!”</p>
<p>Chandra:  And maybe sweet Eve here will get lucky! Mwah!</p>
<p>Eve:  Must not abuse authority, must not make up bogus maintenance  requests, must not give into temptation…</p>
