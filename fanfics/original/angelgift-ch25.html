<h1>Angel's Gift (part 25 of 36)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/angelgift-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>The main bridge of the cruiser Liberty&#39;s Sword hummed
with activity, the final preparations going on all
around as they prepared to finally depart the planet
Earth on a voyage to the homeland of the majority of
it&#39;s crew. The primary stations were all manned, the
people ready, only the last checks of main systems
were remaining.

Allison sat in the command chair, the brown haired
woman crisp and neat dressed in her captain&#39;s uniform,
trying to project a feeling of calm efficiently. She
felt a comforting hand rest on her shoulder and smiled
up at her lover. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said to Jenna softly,
wondering what was going through the princess&#39; head.

&quot;You&#39;ve learned quickly the past few days,&quot; Jenna said
admiringly.

Allison felt a faint blush color her pale cheeks. Her
second, Commander Laurel D&#39;ken had been drilling her
on military tactics and shipboard systems for the past
few days, trying to give her a good grounding in both.
She still wasn&#39;t as familiar as she&#39;d like to be with
the capabilities of the ship that she was now the
captain of, but it was slowly getting better. &quot;The
computers are good teachers,&quot; Allison answered.

&quot;The fact that you might have a talent for this has
nothing to do with it, of course,&quot; Jenna gently teased
her as she bent over the command chair.

Allison felt it was better not to answer that.

Just then the lift doors opened and Commander Laurel
D&#39;ken emerged, the blue haired woman&#39;s hair a bit
messy. She strode towards the captain and saluted
crisply, &quot;Lucas reports that engineering is ready,
shipboard repairs fully completed.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Allison nodded formally.

Laurel sat down in the commander&#39;s position right
beside the captain while Jenna settled into the seat
on the other side that was normally reserved for
mission specialists. &quot;Status reports?&quot; Laurel asked
the bridge staff crisply.

&quot;Navigation is ready,&quot; Sharin said from her place at
the front of the circular bridge. The blonde flashed a
impish smile, &quot;They&#39;ve upgraded the control surfaces
since I last piloted one of these cruisers, but I
think I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Amara spoke up next as she reported, &quot;Tactical is a
go.&quot; The black haired woman continued seriously, &quot;I
can have the main energy batteries and warp
projectiles on standby within five seconds, targeting
locks even faster.&quot;

&quot;Sensors are ready,&quot; Lieutenant Alex Keron said
tentatively, but the black haired young man looked
ready to do the job.

&quot;Communications are normal,&quot; Ensign Kayla Shen said
crisply, the pink haired woman touching a delicate
hand to her headset.

&quot;The sickbay is ready to go,&quot; Kat flashed her friend a
grin as the acting medical officer continued, &quot;and
hopefully so am I.&quot;

Allison looked to Kayla, &quot;Set up a link with the
Galactic Patrol cruiser.&quot;

The front viewscreen showed a moment of static, then
the small bridge of the GP cruiser appeared in front
of them. Marilyn and Roma sat side by side, the blue
haired officer and her android partner looking crisp
and ready in their matching uniforms.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Marilyn saluted crisply, &quot;we&#39;re ready to go.&quot;

&quot;May I thank the crew of the Liberty&#39;s Sword,&quot; Roma
added with a grave smile, &quot;they finished repairs in
record time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass that on,&quot;Laurel said with a grin.

Allison leaned forward, &quot;Then let&#39;s get going as
planned.&quot;

Roma signed off, but not before looking towards Kat
and smiling warmly. The bridge crew leaned over their
controls, Laurel touching a small screen beside her as
she said, &quot;Lucas reports that engineering is ready.&quot;

&quot;Break orbit,&quot; Allison commanded, &quot;best sublight to
Pluto&#39;s orbital ring.&quot;

As the two ships silently and stealthily left the
Earth&#39;s orbit Allison contemplated the star drives
that both ships carried. A smaller craft like the GP
ship could warp into the solar system easily, but a
much larger ship like the Liberty&#39;s Sword had
difficulties. The powerful drive fields functioned
unpredictably in a strong gravity well, randomizing
transit and effectively getting the ship badly lost.
Even worse, without the use of plotting computers and
starcharts there was a good chance the ship might
emerge from warp superimposed with another object.

&#39;I saw a simulation of what would happen in one of the
training manuals,&#39; Allison remembered, &#39;it almost
looked like a sun that was going nova.&#39; Overall, it
was not something that Allison wanted to experience
first hand.

&quot;So how does it feel,&quot; Kat had moved forward from her
station at the back of the bridge to ask, &quot;being in
one of those science fiction novels you like so much?&quot;

Allison looked away from the slowly changing image on
the screen then up at the brown haired girl leaning
over the back of her seat. &quot;Odd,&quot; Allison answered Kat
honestly, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever expected to be Honor
Harrington.&quot;

&quot;You fill out the uniform good,&quot; Kat chuckled. She
stood straight and saluted, &quot;Permission to return to
sickbay, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Permission granted,&quot; Allison responded automatically.
She blinked, &quot;You don&#39;t think there&#39;s going to be an
emergency, do you?&quot;

&quot;Nah,&quot; Kat casually said as she walked to the lift,
&quot;I&#39;m going to take the opportunity to compose a really
steamy love letter to Roma.&quot; With a smirk she stepped
into the lift and was gone.

&quot;I think I like her,&quot; Laurel chuckled softly.

&quot;Allison&#39;s friends do grow on one,&quot; Jenna agreed from
the other side.

A few moments later Sharin smoothly brought the ship
to a stop as she said, &quot;We&#39;ve passed the orbit of
Pluto.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Allison nodded. She activated the
intership communications system and asked,
&quot;Engineering, status?&quot;

&quot;Drives report ready ma&#39;am,&quot; Lucas Anais replied
smoothly and Allison remembered what the golden haired
Magi looked like. Like all of her species she was rake
thin, but according to recorded she accessed was
possessed of senses far beyond most species. &quot;We can
slip-transit whenever you order,&quot; she finished.

&quot;GP cruiser reports heading locked in,&quot; Kayla relayed
the report simply.

Laurel gave Allison a sympathetic glance, tempted to
step in and give the order for the other woman. &#39;No,&#39;
she concluded, &#39;I have to let her do this herself.;

&quot;Activate drive field,&quot; Allison commanded and Sharin
did so, a rumble shaking the ship slightly as power
was redirected. A faint sparkling appeared around both
ships as energy built, a glow that seemed to tease the
eyes and brains.

Sharin calmly said, &quot;Ready for transit.&quot;

&quot;Go,&quot; Allison ordered.

From the exterior it looked like the ships simply
disappeared, but instead their drives carried them
forward into another realm, a strange, red tinted
place shifting and swirling all around them.
Accelerating far beyond the speed of light the ship
raced through this other-realm, onward to their
destination.

Allison slowly unclamped her finders from the arms of
her chair, feeling mildly foolish at her tension.
Taking a breath she pressed a control on her arm rest,
calling up a list of system updates and feeling
comforted that they were all firmly in the green.

&quot;Very nice, love,&quot; Jenna smiled, squeezing Allison&#39;s
arm gently. She rose, a simple bodysuit clinging to
her bosomy form and moved towards the lift, &quot;I&#39;ll go
check on Milly, I want her to make a celebratory
dinner for us once you&#39;re off shift.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s right, good job,&quot; Laurel nodded to her young
captain with a smile. &quot;We can&#39;t do much while in
transit, I would suggest some drills to get everyone
used to working together ,&quot; she offered.

&quot;I&#39;ll be glad to have the practice,&quot; Allison admitted.

To be continued....

Authors Note: Honor Harrington, as many of my readers
already know, is the star of one of my favorite
military SF series, written by David Weber. &#39;On
Basilisk Station&#39; is the first novel of the series and
I&#39;d strongly recommend it. If you like his stuff I&#39;d
also recommend reading &#39;In Death Ground&#39; and &#39;The
Shiva Option&#39; co-written with Steve White, set in a
different but interesting fictional universe.</pre>
