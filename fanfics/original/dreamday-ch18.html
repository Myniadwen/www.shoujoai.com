<h1>Dreaming of Another Day (part 18 of 27)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/dreamday-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>For the next while Kris felt horrible. Her stomach and head hurt like 
nothing else. She started to decline into a pit of loneliness. Tanya 
refused to talk to her at school and when they did cross paths they only 
uttered passing words. This loss of another friend ate away at Kris&#39;s 
heart. She tried a couple of times to talk to Tanya only to be shrugged 
off. Kris became closed off, however Sarah was not willing to give up on 
her friend so easily and continued to stay at her side in hopes
that Kris will open up again. 

To make matters worse, Kris became more frustrated with each passing 
day. She felt haunted by Tanya&#39;s touch and could not get the feeling out 
of her mind. She struggled with an urge that she thought was well locked 
away. She was sure she not only locked the door on that feeling, but 
bolted it, chained and paddle locked the sucker shut for good, but it 
would seem there were cracks in the door Kris was not aware of and the 
emotions kept seeping out. It didn&#39;t help that her fan club was getting 
increasingly bolder. On several occasion Kris found herself grabbed out 
of nowhere and it was beginning to grate on her nerves. It was hard 
enough for her to deal with the feelings that Tanya had awoken. Kris 
spent most of her time wandering the school in a daze. 

During one lunch hour, Kris drifted into the cafeteria. She heavily sat 
down with Sarah right behind her. Before she could eat a bite, a piece 
of paper bounced across the table. Kris let out a long sigh and tried to 
ignore the giggles. Sarah picked up the neatly folded paper, unfolded 
and read it to herself. She tried to stifle back a laugh, then looked 
around to see a group of girls pointing at Kris. 

Sarah handed the note over and still trying not to laugh, &quot;I think this 
is for you.&quot; She said with a smile.

Kris did not look up as she took the note, crumpled it up and tossed it 
in the garbage. Sarah watched the ball of paper bounce off the side of 
the pail and land inside, then turned back to Kris, &quot;You could have at 
least read it. It was cute.&quot; She could not stop smiling.

Kris swallowed a mouthful of her sandwich, &quot;I told you, I don&#39;t have 
time to deal with this stuff. It&#39;s just a game to them. They aren&#39;t 
really serious.&quot; Sarah could hear the strain in her friend&#39;s voice as 
she tried not to yell. Kris was beginning to look very tired and even 
paler than usual. Sarah was beginning to wonder if the girl was getting 
any sleep at all. 

&quot;No, but the harder you try to look cold, the cooler they think you 
are.&quot; Sarah grinned, &quot;What you are is harmless and everyone knows that.&quot;

Kris dropped her sandwich and glared across the table at the other girl  
&quot;Maybe I should start wearing dresses like you and they won&#39;t think I&#39;m 
so cool. What do you think?&quot; She half joked.

Sarah tried to imagine her friend in a skirt and couldn&#39;t help but 
laugh, &quot;You in a dress. That would be something for the school 
yearbook.&quot; Tears filled her eyes as she almost roared. Then she noticed 
the pained look on Kris&#39;s face and stopped herself. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I 
shouldn&#39;t have laughed. Just be yourself, kay?&quot; She gave her friend a 
sweet smile. 

Kris returned the smile, it was a weak and a somewhat sad smile, however 
it was more than she usually did. She noticed herself smiling a bit more 
when she was with Sarah, It wasn&#39;t the same as with Jennifer, but it was 
nice to not feel so nervous all the time. Sarah didn&#39;t seem to care how 
she dressed, or acted for that matter. It was as if she knew that Kris 
was only wearing a mask and pretending to be heartless. Sarah was the 
only person she allowed to see her other side in a long
time. She watched the girl eat and wonder if they could ever be as close 
as she was with Jennifer. Blushing deep red at the thought she quickly 
looked down at her food. Kris couldn&#39;t think that way. She didn&#39;t want 
to hurt anyone again. Part of her wanted to get this girl to leave her 
alone. That if she allowed this to continue the way it had, she&#39;d only 
end up hurting Sarah as she did with Tanya and she couldn&#39;t stand the 
thought of doing that to yet another soul. 

The two got up and left the cafeteria. As they passed through the door 
together Kris felt her hand brush against Sarah&#39;s. She wanted nothing 
more than to be able to take that hand in her&#39;s, but feared that if she 
did, it might be rejected so she just clenched her hands tightly and 
walked closely behind the other girl, down a flight of stairs. 

As they descended to the floor below Kris could feel someone close 
behind her. A soft breeze of air brushed across her ear causing her 
entire body to tingle. She tried hard to ignore it, but the person 
continued to blow on her ear with each step. The moment Kris&#39;s foot 
reached the 2nd floor she turned around, grabbed the person by the 
shoulders and slammed them against the nearest wall. A girl gave out a 
small squeal as she hit the wall. A couple of other girls stood on the 
stairs in shock. In Kris&#39;s hand was none other than the girl she saved 
the first day of school. The same girl who grabbed Kris&#39;s breast and 
tormented her from time to time. For the first time Kris noticed that 
she was rather cute for a kid, she was only a year younger, but Kris 
still considered her a kid.

&quot;That is it. I&#39;ve had enough of these games.&quot; Kris said with anger in 
her eyes. No matter how much Kris glared at the girl she would not quit 
giggling. Kris felt herself getting angrier the more she heard that 
sound, having someone blowing on her ear was the last straw. If they 
were trying to turn her on, they had done a fine job. Kris had been 
struggling to keep herself in line these past couple of weeks. She tried 
to hold herself back, but now she couldn&#39;t stand it anymore. She bared
her teeth trying her best to scare the girl. Wanting her to run before 
Kris did something she would regret. 

&quot;Kris?&quot; Sarah stepped towards her friend.

&quot;NO!&quot; Kris snapped at Sarah, &quot;This girl has been taking every chance she 
can get to get under my skin and blowing on my ears is against the 
rules. She asked for it.&quot; Kris started moving slowly towards the girl 
not letting her eyes wander off. The girl&#39;s eyes  widened wondering what 
Kris was going to do to her. Kris licked her lips, took a deep breath, 
then softly gave the girl a kiss full on her lips. She could hear 
everyone around them suddenly freeze in place and hold their own breath. 

After a long silence the girl finally pushed Kris off of her forcing 
Kris to stumble back into Sarah. The girl wiped her month in disgust 
&quot;Pervert, Why&#39;d you do that for?&quot; She glared at Kris then stormed down 
the hall with the rest of the &quot;Kris fan club&quot; closely behind her. 

Sarah helped Kris stand up again, &quot;Well, that was interesting...&quot; Sarah 
simply said, She was still in shock to see Kris kissing a girl.

Kris let out a soft chuckle. &quot;I told you they weren&#39;t serious.&quot; She was 
shaking a little. Kris had really had hoped that the girl would have 
just run away before she did that, nevertheless it was too late now. 
Kris walked over to a fountain and took a long drink. 

Sarah was still stunned by what just happened, &quot;Did you really have 
to... kiss her?&quot; She said in a daze leaning her back against the wall 
next to the fountain.

&quot;She asked for it.&quot; Kris splashed a bit of water on her face then stood 
up, &quot;Guess they won&#39;t think of me as harmless anymore, now will they?&quot; 
She laughed.

Sarah turned to look at Kris, &quot;Is that what you want? People to be 
spreading more rumors about you?&quot;

Kris stood up. She did not return Sarah&#39;s gaze, &quot;If it keeps people away 
from me than I don&#39;t care.&quot; She stated coldly.

Sarah watched the floor, &quot;Oh, that is how it is? I guess that goes for 
me too then?&quot; Her voice was almost a whisper. 

&quot;I guess,&quot; Kris suddenly realized what she just expressed aloud, however 
before she could take the words back Sarah was already running down the 
hall. Kris hit her head against the wall a couple of times. This wasn&#39;t 
how she wanted things to turn out. First she loses Jenn, then Tanya and 
now Sarah. She didn&#39;t know what she wanted anymore. She let out a deep 
sigh and tried to sort out her thoughts when a voice came over the 
intercom. 

&quot;Kris Carty, would you come to the office please, Kris Carty to the 
office.&quot; The voice crackled over the speaker. 

Kris hit her head against the wall once more time, &quot;It never ends&quot; She 
said to herself as she started down the stairs to the office.
