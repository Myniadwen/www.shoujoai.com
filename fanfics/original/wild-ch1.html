<pre>      The final branch gave a satisfying thump as Carmen
Henderson heaved it over top of her rough bonfire.
There was paper, dry brush and the heavier tree
branches, all roughly set up in a pyramid. Flicking a
match alight she dropped it onto the crumpled
newspaper, watching it and the dry twigs quickly burst
into flames.

      The clearing in the woods was mostly clear of
undergrowth, other campers having cleared the area to
make setting up easier. Her tent was set to one side
of the clearing, her jeep sitting not far away, trunk
loaded with supplies. Above her the stars glittered in
the darkness like gems on velvet, suiting the silent
beauty of the dark forest.

      Taking a long stick Carmen poked at the crackling
fire, her expression oddly mournful. &quot;I just wish I
had someone here to share it with me,&quot; she murmured.
She and her lover had been planning to go out here for
weeks, but that was before she had found out that Anne
had been cheating on her. After all the drama of
kicking her out, Carmen had decided she needed to get
away, and since she had already booked this spot, she
figured she might as well go.

      Going over to the green jeep she got the portable
radio out, hooking it to the battery, and then she dug
out a package of hot-dogs from the fully stocked
cooler. Spitting the dogs on several carefully cleaned
twigs she set them over the fire, and then turned the
radio on to one of the local stations. Tuning out the
droning news reader she perked up as the music started
even as she kept an eye on her hot-dogs, turning them
over as needed.

      The noises of the forest all around were comforting
as she pulled the first slightly burnt dog off of its
stick, applying some relish and ketchup to it before
cautiously taking a small bite. Satisfied that it was
cooked right through she munched on it happily, lost
in gazing into the hypnotic golden flames in front of
her.

      &quot;Would you mind some company?&quot; the quiet voice made
Carmen jump.

      &quot;Who?&quot; whirling around Carmen saw the young woman who
was standing at the edge of the firelight, her gaze
faintly amused. Long glossy black hair flowed down her
back, her face delicate and hazel eyes glowing as she
moved forward towards the fire.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the young woman apologized to her
gently, her white T-shirt shining, &quot;I didn&#39;t mean to
startle you. My name is Diana.&quot;

      &quot;Carmen,&quot; she introduced herself, frowning up at the
other woman. Her good manners finally kicked in as she
waved to a nearby log, &quot;Sure, take a seat.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Diana&#39;s long, jeans clad legs were
graceful as she settled down on one of the logs. &quot;I
was out walking when I smelled your cooking,&quot; she
said, &quot;and I got curious.&quot;

      &quot;Walking out here on your own?&quot; Carmen felt a flash
of concern for the strange young woman, &quot;Isn&#39;t that
dangerous?&quot;

      &quot;I can take care of myself,&quot; Diana answered, her lips
curling up into a smile.

      Carmen met her hazel eyes for a moment then looked
away, suddenly wondering how the young woman looked at
her. Her red hair was long, pulled back in a ponytail,
and her blue eyes were quite striking, she was told.
Carmen&#39;s  body was more average looking, sadly, though
none of her lovers had ever complained.

      &quot;Are you camping nearby?&quot; Carmen asked, suddenly
looking forward to the next few days out here in the
woods.

      &quot;Not to far,&quot; Diana waved towards the forest.

      Deciding to be hospitable Carmen pulled a well-done
hot-dog off a spit and passed it over to Diana, &quot;Well,
I&#39;m glad to have the company.&quot;

      &quot;Thank you,&quot; Diana murmured as she took the dog.
Applying condiments she ate eagerly, munching her &#39;dog
with surprising speed, but she still was oddly neat,
licking the last crumbs from her fingers then wiping
them on her jeans.

      Carmen felt moderately surprised at the girl&#39;s
appetite as she reached for another hot-dog, &quot;Do you
want another?&quot;

      Gracefully Diana rose, looking down at Carmen with an
oddly unreadable expression on her face. &quot;I&#39;d better
go,&quot; she said as she strode over to the edge of the
fire light then turned to look at her, &quot;but could I
see you tomorrow?&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Carmen answered and was rewarded by
a flash of Diana&#39;s smile.

      &quot;See you then,&quot; and Diana took a few steps into the
deepening darkness before finally disappearing into
the night.

      Carmen felt oddly bereft when Diana left and finally
finished her food then got ready for bed. Rolling out
her bedroll a safe distance away from the flames she
lay out, the long trip up there finally catching up to
her. &#39;I think this will end up being a nice trip,&#39; she
thought as she dozed off.

      The bird calls woke her sometime after the dawn, the
sun shining down through the trees. Unzipping herself
from her sleeping bag Carmen got up and stumbled into
the woods to go bathroom, then headed for a nearby
stream to wash up. Instant coffee helped wake her up,
along with some hot porridge, then she began to plan
her day.

      Changing into her hiking gear Carmen headed out with
her compass and map ready and a backpack with snacks
and a drink inside, determined to find the local
sights. There was just a bit of crispness to the air
as she strode down the path through the woods, a hint
in the fall air that winter really wasn&#39;t all that far
away.

      An hour later Carmen puffed slightly as she climbed,
the flat forest floor having become a steep hill. &#39;And
I thought I was in good shape,&#39; she thought wryly as
she took a curve by a boulder, &#39;I really need to work
out more.&#39;

      Something drew Carmen&#39;s gaze up the path and she
froze, eyes widening in surprise. The wolf stood up
the trail not too far away, the sleek animal looking
down at her with a powerful gaze. It&#39;s fur was a mix
of black and gray, hazel eyes shining with
intelligence as it nonchalantly turned it&#39;s back and
with a wag of it&#39;s tail it was off. Bounding from
boulder to boulder it bounced down the hill, soon
disappearing from view.

      &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Carmen breathed out in awe, heart
hammering in her chest. &#39;I was that close,&#39; she
thought as she leaned up against another stone, &#39;it
could have...&#39;

      &quot;Are you all right?&quot; the quiet voice asked,

      &quot;EEP!&quot; Carmen jumped, heart pounding as she whirled
around to see Diana looking at her curiously, a degree
of amusement in her hazel eyes. &quot;Don&#39;t do that,&quot; she
blurted.

      &quot;Do what?&quot; Diana raised a delicate eyebrow.

      Carmen gave her a suspicious look as she felt her
heart slowing again, wondering if Diana was joking.
&quot;Did you see that wolf?&quot; she asked softly, eyes
sparkling.

      &quot;I guess I missed it,&quot; Diana answered, her expression
regretful, &quot;what did it look like?&quot;

      &quot;It was beautiful,&quot; Carmen murmured, realizing at
that moment that she meant every word. Haltingly she
tried to describe her meeting with the wolf, the
impression it had made on her, but words seemed to
fail her.

      Still, Diana seemed caught up in her words, the
lovely young woman listening with a gentle sort of
intensity. &quot;I don&#39;t think I have heard someone
describe the alpha wolf so well,&quot; she said as they
walked up the rocky path, the sound of running water
growing louder.

      &quot;The leader of a wolf pack,&quot; Diana explained a bit
sheepishly, &quot;I&#39;ve read a great deal about them over
the years.&quot;

      &quot;Are you studying them?&quot; Carmen blinked.

      &quot;Intimately,&quot; was Diana&#39;s quiet answer.

      They ascended slowly as they talked, the sound of
running water growing louder as they reached a rise,
the stream rushing by. Not far away the land dropped
off steeply, creating a waterfall of starling beauty,
not to mention making a hot day comfortably cool.

      &quot;I was planning to have my lunch here,&quot; Carmen said
as she eased her backpack off, &quot;would you care to join
me?&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t want to impose,&quot; Diana, oddly, almost looked
like she was going to bolt.

      &quot;I have lots,&quot; Carmen hastened to reassure her then
blushed as she confessed, &quot;I packed a bit extra,
hoping I&#39;d run into you.&quot;

      &quot;Really?&quot; Diana&#39;s lips curled up in a tentative
smile.

      Carmen nodded, &quot;Really.&quot;

      &quot;Then I&#39;d love to,&quot; Diana nodded warmly as she
settled down beside Carmen. On top of the warm stone
they unpacked the food as she noted, &quot;It does seem a
bit unfair that you keep having to feed me, though.&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Carmen laughed.

      &quot;Still, I should pay you back,&quot; Diana mused, &quot;maybe
I&#39;ll bring dinner to you one time.&quot;

      Another blush colored Carmen&#39;s cheeks as she said,
&quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;
