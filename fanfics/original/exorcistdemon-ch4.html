<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 4 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>      They went out on a date. A date! Isaka sat furiously in Krystal&#39;s living room. Her and 
her boyfriend had gone out for dinner and then gone on a romantic walk in the park. When 
they started to kiss, Isaka had to leave out of disgust. How dare... that boy, Seth or 
whatever his name was, kiss what was going to be hers. Hell, she had already claimed Krystal 
at least 20 times in her mind, so how dare he! Isaka slinked back into the shadows as she 
heard the door unlock.

      &quot;I had a lot of fun, Seth,&quot; said Krystal and she gave the boy a generous kiss on the 
lips. &quot;Oh, no problem! Are we still on for Thursday or will your &#39;job&#39; get in the way 
again?&quot; He wiggled his eyebrows and Krystal just blushed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I had to cancel our 
date that week, but I got called in to exorcise a demon...&quot;

      Her boyfriend, Seth, knew all about her exploits as an exorcist and he laughed as she 
invited him in for something to drink. He sat down on the couch as she brought over a soda 
for the both of them. &quot;I don&#39;t even want to think about that last job. This town was being 
terrorized by a demon that seduced girls in their sleep and it had kidnapped this 14 year 
old from the town,&quot; Seth started to laugh at her words and Krystal just pouted. &quot;That wasn&#39;t 
even the worse of it! Me and her best friend went to rescue her from the demon and guess 
what?&quot;

      Seth just shrugged and started drinking his soda. &quot;...The demon was a girl.&quot; He sent a 
spray of soda out of his mouth in disbelief. &quot;Wait, it was a lesbian demon,&quot; he asked, 
staring at her wide eyed. &quot;Was the demon totally manly?&quot;

      All the while, Isaka was grinding her teeth. As though she didn&#39;t dislike Seth 
enough...

      &quot;No, no, no. She was actually really beautiful.&quot; Seth gave her a slight nudge. &quot;She 
didn&#39;t try to pull any moves on you did she? If so, then I&#39;d have to fight for my 
girlfriend...&quot; He wrapped an arm around her shoulder and gave her a kiss on the head. 
Krystal just blushed. &quot;No, she thought I was a teenage boy, so nothing happened. When we 
rescued the girl, she ended up confessing her love for her best friend.&quot;

      Seth chugged down the rest of the soda and shrugged again. &quot;Well, boys and girls who 
are really good friends tend to fall in love, like us!&quot; Krystal looked away embarrassed. 
&quot;...they&#39;re both girls, Seth.&quot;

      Her boyfriend let out an awkward cough before standing up. &quot;It&#39;s already kind of late, 
so I have to get home, Krystal.&quot; He gave her a nice, long kiss on the lips before leaving.

      Isaka was sure that she had ground her teeth down to nothing while listening to that 
conversation. At least Krystal thought she was beautiful... 

***** 

      This was it. Isaka licked her lips and watched Krystal. The beautiful girl was fast 
asleep, unknowing of the demon lurking closer and closer to her. She pushed some of the 
brown hair away from her face as she slunk into the bed. Her experienced hands soon found 
Krystal&#39;s waist and brought the girl closer to her. Isaka carefully spooned her against her 
body before letting her hands drift under Krystal&#39;s shirt. The blonde unconsciously shivered 
as skin met skin. Isaka had never been so excited to take someone like she was with Krystal. 
She pressed her lips against the blonde&#39;s neck intimately, giving light, but passionate 
kisses all around her nape.

      Krystal started to writhe and murmur in her sleep, unaware that the sensations were 
being solicited by Isaka. It was only when the demon cupped her breasts that Krystal awoke. 
And boy, was she surprised. With a scream, Krystal kicked herself out of the bed and fell 
upon the floor. She scrambled a bit before her hand found the cord of the lamp on her 
nightstand. With one pull, she illuminated the room and the sultry demon perched on her bed.

      &quot;Boo.&quot;

      Krystal screamed again before racing to her feet. &quot;You! I-I-Isaka! What are you doing 
here?!&quot; She slowly backed away as Isaka came off the bed and crept forward. &quot;Well, I wanted 
to get a revenge on the exorcist and I realized he was a beautiful girl.&quot; Krystal gulped 
audibly.

      &quot;I figured, I could get my revenge and get a delicious girl.&quot; Isaka&#39;s predatory gleam 
wasn&#39;t helping Krystal at all. &quot;S-stay away! I didn&#39;t hurt you too badly because I know you 
aren&#39;t that evil... so please, don&#39;t make me hurt you.&quot;

      In a flash, Isaka had her pinned against the wall. &quot;Not so fast. I underestimated you 
last time and you&#39;re going to enjoy this so much that you won&#39;t even think about attacking,&quot; 
Isaka said, enjoying the redness of Krystal&#39;s face. Before the blonde could protest, Isaka 
forced a knee in between Krystal&#39;s thighs. As if her face wasn&#39;t red enough...

      &quot;No, Isaka, don&#39;t!&quot; Krystal turned away as the demon leaned forward, wanting to kiss 
those lips so badly. Unfortunately, Isaka was too distracted to realize that Krystal had 
conjured up a spell. &quot;Sealing art: soul prison!&quot; Krystal frantically shouted out and Isaka 
was engulfed in a white light. Krystal closed her eyes and concentrated on completing the 
magic.

      Isaka couldn&#39;t move. Her limbs felt tired and weak, as did the rest of her body. Even 
her mind felt foggy. Soul prison? What was a soul prison, anyways? The demon tried to speak, 
but she couldn&#39;t. Her body felt like it was decaying and everything felt so... so...

      As the white light started to fade from Isaka, Krystal explained the spell. &quot;The soul 
prison is probably my strongest move. It reduces a person to their basest, purest form and 
makes them weak. Now, you have to stay in that form until I think you&#39;re ready to stop 
attacking young girls.&quot;

      The blonde&#39;s smile faded as the energy cleared and she saw Isaka&#39;s reduced form. Isaka 
shakily stood on her feet, confused as to why everything seemed so big and why she seemed so 
small. She felt woozy, hungry, and estranged. Her confusion mounted as Krystal&#39;s blank face 
turned into an expression of utter adoration.

      Krystal crouched down. She couldn&#39;t believe her eyes... the sexy, seductive demon had 
been transformed into a harmless, cute little 5 year old. Her brown hair was past her waist 
and her purple eyes were so impossibly big that Krystal couldn&#39;t help but gush. &quot;You&#39;re 
so... so... cute!&quot; The demon was happily embraced by Krystal and relished being smushed up 
against her bosom. &quot;I can&#39;t believe how cute your form is...! I could just keep you all to 
myself.&quot; She lovingly cradled Isaka and carried the demon towards the bathroom.

      &quot;What? You think I&#39;m cute? What&#39;s wrong wif me?&quot; Krystal grinned over Isaka&#39;s 
childspeak and stood in front of the bathroom mirror. Isaka looked over at her young little 
reflection. She started to bawl. 

***** 

      Eveon anxiously sat up in her bedroom. Regardless of the advice the exorcist had given 
her, she couldn&#39;t gather enough courage to talk to Mina. Everything about it scared her. How 
long had Mina felt like that? Was it always that way? What ran through her mind when they 
spent time together? Was that why... was that why Mina had been so upset when a boy asked 
her out...? She just couldn&#39;t believe it. Eveon broke out of her musings when she heard the 
front door of the bed and breakfast open. The sound was familiar, but she knew exactly who 
it was. Ever since Eveon had run away from her two days ago, she&#39;d been trying to avoid Mina 
like the plague.

      Nobody else knew that Mina loved her. The other girl hadn&#39;t come back to school 
because the Lamets wanted to make sure that their daughter was okay. Eveon could hear her 
mother chatting happily with Mina and she rocked back and forth on her bed. The exorcist 
said to talk to Mina... but what did he know? It wasn&#39;t like his best friend was confessing 
his gay love for him... As she stewed on her bed, her mother came in.

      &quot;Mina&#39;s downstairs. She wants to know if you want to go on a picnic with her,&quot; said 
Abby. Eveon looked over at her mom before letting out a sigh. She was still Mina&#39;s best 
friend so... &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m coming...&quot; Abby followed her daughter downstairs. Mina was standing 
there, looking off into space, with a picnic basket in her hands.

      When she saw Eveon, she gave her an embarrassed smile. The blonde girl could only 
gulp. She had to... she had to talk to Mina, no matter how awkward it would be. Abby noticed 
the obvious tension between the two girls and whispered into her daughter&#39;s ear, &quot;Did 
something happen when you snuck into her room last night?&quot;

      Eveon immediately jerked away from her mother, embarrassed. &quot;How-how did you know I 
snuck out?!&quot; Abby just gave her a daughter an unamused look. &quot;Do you know how obvious it is 
when you try to dart across the lawn? You&#39;re a middle schooler, not a ninja.&quot; She gave her 
embarrassed daughter a quick kiss on the head before shooing her and Mina off. &quot;Be safe.&quot;

      As soon as they were out the door, an awkward silence fell over both girls. &quot;...um...I 
guess we can go eat at the usual spot...&quot; Mina said quietly and Eveon just nodded. As they 
walked towards the clearing in the now demon-free forest, there was at least 3 feet 
separating them.

      Mina silently set down the blanket and Eveon took it as her invitation to sit down. 
When both the girls were seated another awkward silence permeated the air. Eveon took a deep 
breath and finally spoke. &quot;I... guess this is a good time to talk about... stuff...&quot; Mina 
just nodded slowly. &quot;Yeah...&quot;

      Mina bit her lip nervously and ruffled her hair. &quot;I want to apologize for last night,&quot; 
they said simultaneously before blushing and looking away. &quot;Uh, you first, Mina.&quot; The other 
girl shook her head. &quot;No, blondes first. You go.&quot; Eveon just gave her friend a questioning 
look and Mina looked away sheepishly. She tried to stifle her laughter at Eveon&#39;s 
expression, but she couldn&#39;t. In no time at all, both girls were laughing.

      &quot;...okay, okay, I&#39;ll go first...&quot; Eveon tried to look her friend in the eye. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry I ran off like that... I should have stayed and... I dunno, I just got freaked out.&quot; 
Mina giggled, &quot;I could tell...&quot; The black haired girl started to pull out food from the 
basket before speaking again.

      &quot;Last night... I was really stupid. I kind of... jumped the gun, I guess.&quot; She smiled 
sheepishly and Eveon just gave her an &#39;oh really?&#39; look. &quot;Yeah, attacking your best friend 
like a rabbit during spring time is a little presumptuous...&quot; Mina turned beet red and Eveon 
laughed at her.

      &quot;But seriously, you really, really scared me... I&#39;m kind of scared right now...&quot; Mina 
gave her an apologetic look. &quot;I-I know I shouldn&#39;t have... Isaka just told me that I 
should... well, she said that I should look for a subtle hint or something...&quot;

      Eveon gave her a curious look. &quot;Isaka? Who&#39;s that? It sounds like some freak from a 
story or show or something.&quot; Mina pulled out the sandwiches and the lemonade from the 
basket. &quot;No! That&#39;s the demon&#39;s name.&quot;

      However, Mina was sure Eveon didn&#39;t care anymore because she was eyeing the sandwiches 
like a starving dog... and Mina happily relinquished the food to her friend. &quot;So, this demon 
lady, what did she do to you?&quot;

      Mina blushed. &quot;W-well, it was... um...&quot; Eveon looked at her wide eyed. &quot;She didn&#39;t... 
she didn&#39;t... you know...?&quot; Eveon wiggled her fingers suggestively and Mina shoved her. 
&quot;No!!! She didn&#39;t do that! She just... gave me some advice...&quot; 

***** 

      Mina wasn&#39;t sure how much further she could run so she feel to her knees, unsure of 
where in the forest she was. She tried to wipe the tears from her face, but she couldn&#39;t 
understand why she was crying. Why was she so mad that Eveon was considering dating that 
kid? She didn&#39;t know the boy... or even care about him... so...? Mina brought her knees up 
to her chest and continued to sob. She let her backpack fall dejectedly next to her as she 
tried to figure everything out.

      Lately, she&#39;d been feeling strange about Eveon. They&#39;d always been good friends and 
sometimes... Mina wasn&#39;t really sure what she wanted. She would always cuddle with her 
during sleepovers, hug her whenever she could and sometimes... Mina wiped her tears away. 
&quot;Stop thinking like that...&quot; she muttered to herself. Nothing... was making her feel better. 
When the feelings started a year ago, Mina figured they would go away.

      They didn&#39;t. Even spending time with Eveon didn&#39;t help anymore and Mina knew she 
didn&#39;t like her like that... right? Right? &quot;My, my, my... what&#39;s a confused little thing 
like you doing in my forest?&quot;

      Mina&#39;s head shot up at the sound of the sultry voice and she suddenly realized where 
she was. The middle of the demon&#39;s forest... She felt two arms wrap around her and the voice 
was suddenly next to her ear. &quot;Oh, I see... it&#39;s Mina. I was going to pay you a visit one of 
these nights, but it&#39;s nice to see that you came to me.&quot;

      She broke out of her grasp and whirled around to see the demon smiling warmly at her. 
&quot;I-I-I&#39;m not like that!&quot; Isaka just sighed and walked over to her. &quot;Not every girl is &#39;like 
that&#39;, but there are plenty who are.&quot; Mina backed away until she was up against a tree.

      &quot;You see, you&#39;re one of the few who&#39;s discovered that no man can satiate you.&quot; Mina 
gulped as Isaka came closer. &quot;Oh, you can try to be with men, but your thoughts will keep 
wandering back to her...&quot; She leaned in to whisper into Mina&#39;s ear. &quot;It&#39;s that blonde 
tomboy, right?&quot;

      When Isaka pulled back, she was delighted to see Mina&#39;s bright red face. &quot;We&#39;re... 
we&#39;re just friends...&quot; The demon cupped Mina&#39;s cheek with one hand. &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be 
ashamed of your feelings. Just because Eveon doesn&#39;t have a Y chromosome doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s 
wrong.&quot;

      Mina was shocked. &quot;How do you know her name-&quot; Isaka put a finger to her lips. &quot;I&#39;m 
more omniscient than people realize.&quot; She pulled back from Mina and took her hand. &quot;I 
understand how you feel and how confused you are, so... I&#39;m going to give you private 
lessons.&quot;

      Mina paled significantly and tried to pull away. &quot;No! Let go of me! I&#39;m not like 
that!&quot; Isaka just leaned in and whispered in her ear, &quot;Go to sleep, my little dear...&quot; Mina 
collapsed in her awaiting arms. 

***** 

      Eveon nervously bit into her ham sandwich. &quot;Are you sure she didn&#39;t so anything?&quot; Mina 
pouted and drank some of the lemonade. &quot;You&#39;re interrupting my story...&quot;

      The blonde girl held up her hands in defense. &quot;Sorry! She just sounds like a total 
creeper and I don&#39;t want anybody to violate you...&quot; Mina smiled fondly at those words. 
&quot;...wow... that means a lot to me, Eveon...&quot; Mina cupped her blushing cheeks and Eveon 
gulped.

      Way to not convince your best friend that you&#39;re straight...
