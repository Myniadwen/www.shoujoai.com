<h1>Between the Lines (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ilze.html">Ilze</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/betweenlines-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;So, tell me about her.&quot; I look up from my lunch and see Kelli&#39;s eyes 
looking directly at me. I blush and remember how she had read my English 
paper before I turned it in. Apparently, I really did make her sound 
beautiful because Kel had been asking me about her all day. Deep down I 
knew she was just teasing me but I still couldnt help myself from 
blushing when she brought it up.

Soon, the rest of my friends came a sat down around me. To my left was 
Joey and to my right was another of my friends, Clark. He had been in 
English as well and also read the paper. Of course, he had to remark 
about his fascination with asian women and how he wanted me to introduce 
him.

Clark was... probably my most attractive friend. He was tall, a good 6;2 
and had a nice muscular build. His dark skin shows his african ancestry 
and his head is shaved, something the varsity basketball team did as a 
sign of unity or something like that. Chestnut colored eyes finished up 
his strong face. I came to know Clark my Sophmore year when he had moved 
to Escort and was &#39;introducing&#39; himself to all the women of the school. 
We hit it off and soon became quick friends, but nothing more. I wouldnt 
dream of dating Clark, he just wasnt my type. His personality is 
humorous and friendly but he also has that reputation of being a 
&#39;player.&#39; Despite that, he&#39;s still one of my best pals.

I sigh, shooting a distinct glare at Kelli, &quot;She&#39;s just a friend. I met 
her at the grocery store yesterday. Then she stopped by the house 
yesterday because I dropped my grandpa&#39;s medicine.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot; Clark said sarcastically, &quot;What&#39;s her name again?&quot;

&quot;Karen.&quot; I leave out the last name purposly.

The conversation quickly drifts into other things that I didnt really 
care to listen to. Looking around the courtyard, I quickly notice that 
there is someone missing withen my friends. I turn to Joey, &quot;Where&#39;s 
Burg?&quot;

He looks at me and speaks with a mouthful of sandwich, &quot;He left last 
period.&quot; He pauses to chew and swallow, &quot;Said he had to meet someone. 
Dunno who.&quot;

I nod absently. He&#39;d been acting reallu wierd lately, as if he was 
hiding something from us. Now, James Luxenburg wasnt the type of guy who 
would just come out a tell people about his personal life and he usually 
kept to himself but recently... he&#39;s just been acting mysterious. 
Eventually, I just give up on the subject. Whatever it was, he&#39;d handle 
it in his own way and it wasnt really my business.

The bell rings, signalling the end of lunch period and I continue with 
the rest of the day. Of course, nothing exciting happened besides 
watching Clark and Joey almost choke on a piece of candy when they were 
dared to swallow one of McAfee&#39;s hardtack whole. The dismissal bell is 
welcomed at the end of the day. I gather my books and head to say 
farewell to my friends. They were all gathered in the parking lot, 
talking amongst themselves.

As I come upon them, Joey turns around to greet me, &quot;Hey, Lex. You never 
told us, you coming tomorrow?&quot;

I nod with a smile, &quot;Yeah. I decided I might as well go.&quot; Turning, I 
look at Kel, &quot;Are you coming?&quot;

&quot;Unless something comes up.&quot; She says, pushing a streak of colored hair 
behind her ear, &quot;Can you give me a ride home, Lexi?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, sure. You wanna go now?&quot;

&quot;Whenever you want.&quot;

We hang out outside the school for a few more minutes until I finally 
decide to leave. Leading Kelli down to my car, I unlock the door for her 
and we climb in. I absently toss my books into the messy back seat that 
served as more of a storage space than a backseat and start the car. The 
old Honda stalls a moment but soon enough and I pull out of the school 
parking lot and into the street.

&quot;To you&#39;re house?&quot; I ask hesitantly and grimace when she nods. I always 
hate dropping my best friend off at her house because I know whats 
waiting for her there. &quot;Why dont you come over to my house for awhile. I 
need some help on Trig anyways.&quot;

She appears to be thinking a moment, &quot;Alright. For awhile but I&#39;d better 
not stay out too long.&quot;

We drive down the empty streets of Escort for a few moments until the 
peace is momentarilly disturbed by the sight of a boy walking loneily 
down the street. At first sight, I would mistake the boy for Burg but 
upon closer inspection, he is a diffrent man. Wearing a black 
trenchcoat, I&#39;d think he&#39;d be sweating in the warm weather but his pale 
face appeared to have no sweat and his tall, &#39;moehawk&#39; hairstyle didnt 
seem disturbed. As we drove by the stranger, I momentarilly recognized 
him but the feeling left quickly as I slowly came upon my house.

I park the car neatly in the driveway and hop out of the car, leaving my 
books behind. Kelli follows as I march up to the front door and brightly 
swing it open. I kick my shoes off at the door and stroll in, looking 
for my grandpa. He is found hunched over a newspaper and he looks up 
from the paper with a smile.

&quot;Hey, Lexy.&quot; He stands creakily and comes over where he see&#39;s Kelli, 
&quot;Oh, havent seen you in awhile.&quot;

Kelli smiled at him and nodded. All my friends knew and liked my grandpa 
but he only remembered Kelli&#39;s name. &quot;We&#39;re gonna head up to my room, 
alright?&quot; I say and turn around, &quot;Dad&#39;s gonna be home early tonight, 
right?&quot;

&quot;Yep. I think he&#39;s picking up take out too.&quot;

I nod and tread up the stairs, Kelli trailing behind me. Entering the 
room, I sit down on my bed as Kelli takes a seat in on the opposite 
side. She turns to me with a naughty smile planted on her face. Staring 
at her a moment, I eventual ask, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Do you like that girl?&quot;

&quot;Karen?&quot; I ask, slightly shocked. &quot;No, of course not. Why?&quot;

&quot;Just the way you acted.&quot; She lays down, &quot;I saw a blush. You never blush 
when I tease you like that.&quot;

&quot;Well, I dont.&quot; I say gruffly with a pout.

She laughs, &quot;Fine, fine. No need to throw a tantrum about it.&quot; I pout.

About an hour later, there is a knock on the door and I answer it to see 
my Dad standing there with a bag of McDonald&#39;s food in his hand. &quot;Hey.&quot; 
He greets me and hands the bag over. He glanced at Kel, &quot;Hello, Kelli.&quot;

&quot;Hi, Mr. LaFayette.&quot; She says and stands up.

&quot;There&#39;s two burgers in there, you&#39;re grandpa gave me a call and said 
Kelli was over here.&quot; He ran a hand through his jet black hair, &quot;He also 
said you&#39;re going to a party tomorrow?&quot;

I scratch my head as I hear Kelli giggled slightly at the fact that I 
hadnt even asked my father yet, &quot;Uh, yeah. It&#39;s at Tora Lucas&#39; house.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve met him. Do you have a ride?&quot; I say yes, &quot;Well then it&#39;s 
okay with me. You know the curfew though. He leaves me with that and he 
turns to leave, shutting my door behind him.

Kelli laughed again and I throw her sandwich at her, &quot;Shut up and eat.&quot; 
I sit back down and we eat are meal silently.

I take Kelli home about a half hour later and I return to my house 
quickly, the Sun was setting. Entering with a yawn, I tell the males of 
my house that I&#39;m heading up to bed and they each grant me a goodnight. 
I change and jump into bed and I&#39;m greeted by sleep quickly. Tomorrow 
would be quite a day.

My night was actually quite a unrestful one. Tossing and turning and 
constantly wake up, I finally fall into a deep sleep about 6 a.m. 
Because of the restless night, I sleep in until about noon which is 
something I rarely do. Heading down the stairs, I come upon my grandpa 
and dad sitting in the kitchen. They&#39;re talking about something and me, 
being the curious little girl I am, decide to eavesdrop a little. I 
tiptoe right beside the kitchen door and listen intently to the 
conversation they&#39;re engaged in.

&quot;How long has he been back?&quot; I identify the voice as Grandpa&#39;s.

&quot;About two weeks I think.&quot; Dad. &quot;He said he isnt gonna be here too long 
and that he&#39;s heading for New York in two weeks.&quot;

&quot;Why&#39;d he even come back?&quot;

&quot;John*...&quot; My dad says exasperantly, &quot;He&#39;s been gone for a long time. He 
just wants to see his family.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to tell Alexia?&quot;

&quot;... Not yet.&quot; I hear him sigh, &quot;I dont want her running off to greet 
him. Joel aint what he used to be. I can tell that already.&quot;

I nearly fall over when I hear that last sentence. Joel&#39;s back?! My 
little brother who ran away long ago? My feeling of excitment is quickly 
overtaken by anger that Dad wasnt even going to tell me that he was 
back. I hear a chair scooting as someone stands up and I quickly turn 
around to sneak back upstairs. Unfortunatly, I&#39;m not quite fast enough 
as I feel a hand grasp my shoulder. My head turns slowly to look at my 
father.

&quot;Alexia...&quot; He says in a scolding voice, &quot;How long have you been out 
here?&quot;

I turn around to look at him, &quot;Long enough.&quot; I say defiantly.

&quot;Come here. We&#39;ll discuss this.&quot;

My father leads me into the kitchen and he points to a chair for me to 
sit in. I do so obediantly and look at my dad and grandpa. My father 
places his head in his hands and his elbows on the table, &quot;Now, 
Alexia... you know Joel&#39;s back in town now, right?&quot;

I nod, that part I overheard, &quot;Yeah and why werent you going to tell 
me?&quot;

&quot;Hold on.&quot; He looks at me, &quot;Joel has been back for two weeks and I&#39;ve 
only known it for about three days. He called me at work and wanted me 
to meet him. I did so yesterday and he has changed. Dramatically.&quot; He 
sighs, his eyes appear weary. This was a look you rarely got to see of 
Joseph LaFayette. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what he has been doing all this time but 
I wouldnt be suprised about anything. He isnt the little brother who 
left here. I dont want you involved with him until I talk to him more.&quot;

I see the truth and concern in my father&#39;s voice. I know Joel was having 
trouble before he left. He&#39;d been hanging out with not the kind of 
people you&#39;d want to hang out with and he was becoming very rebellious. 
I heard several rumors about him including crime and drugs. I also know 
that Dad had been trying everything he could to help his son and that it 
broke his heart when Joel left. I nodded to my father, &quot;I&#39;m not going to 
go searching for him, Daddy. It&#39;d just be nice if you&#39;d tell me.&quot;

&quot;I was going to just not yet.&quot; He leans back in his chair, &quot;Please dont 
go looking for him and dont tell anyone he&#39;s back. Alright?&quot;

I hesitate to answer a moment but finally nod, &quot;Fine.&quot; I cross my arms 
and yawn.

&quot;Good.&quot; He smiles, &quot;Now, about you&#39;re eavsdropping.&quot; I grimace, Gramps 
laughs.
