<h1>The Misadventures of Anna (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Phase One: Anna&#39;s First Day at Atlantic High  

&quot;Take good care out there, Anna! Listen to all your teachers! And 
remember to have fun!&quot;

With a gentle smile, Anna Michaels waved goodbye to her mother, who 
shortly drove away obviously in a rush to get to work. It had been at 
least two weeks since she and her mom had moved from their old place 
back home. Truth be told, she loved Minnesota. The sites, the sounds, 
the smells. She had grown up there and it was her home. But ever since 
Anna&#39;s dad took off last year, things had been tight for Anna and her 
mom money-wise.  

So when she had been promoted to the deputy head of a powerful 
electronics company in Victoria Texas, Anna&#39;s mother really couldn&#39;t 
refuse the offer. It had come as a shock to Anna to say the very least; 
she had never expected to be moved all this way just for a job, but 
what choice did she have? Her mom worked really hard, so any sacrifices 
she had to pay was nothing overall to the sacrifices her mother made 
for her.  

So, Anna Michaels willingly embraced this change in location. Victoria 
wasn&#39;t exactly a town that was the forefront of modernity, more or less 
inferior to the big cities, but the environment was pretty cool and it 
was a little more &#39;homey&#39; than before.  

Complete with her book bag tight in her grip, Anna stood before her all 
new school, the all-girl establishment of Atlantic High. Despite the 
marvelously original name, this place did look fairly comforting. Not 
harsh like her old school, more like a half decent high school that 
girls could feel safe in. Which was what Anna really wanted right now. 

By nature, Anna wasn&#39;t shy; she was a woman of great curiosity and 
inquisitiveness. However, she was a gentle and caring girl who didn&#39;t 
mix in with great ease. If people in Victoria were friendly, it might 
just be that much easier to get adjusted. After taking a deep breath of 
preparation, Anna stepped forward through the metal gates into the 
courtyard of Atlantic High, her new school. Needless to say, Anna was 
completely ignorant of all the stare she was getting as she walked 
inside. Across the courtyard, a group of three girls studied this new 
young piece of skirt that had stepped through the gates to their 
school. Two of these three girls were lightly wrapped in private, 
meaningless conversation between themselves, while the remaining girl 
eyed Anna over intently.  

The young girl studying Anna shifted her eyes up and down, eying the 
new student over. Her name was Holly-Raine Johnson. Holly-Raine or just 
plain &#39;Holly&#39; was a cute young thing. She stood (or sat, as she was 
sitting) at a petite 5&#39;&#39;, with short cinnamon brown hair, coming to 
rest just lightly above the curves of her shoulders. Her mischievous 
eyes beaming a haunting grip of bright green, her cute lips curved into 
a gentle smile as she stared at a bouncingly innocent Anna.  

&quot;Wow...&quot; Holly-Raine said under her breath. &quot;...Who is that girl? She&#39;s 
new...&quot; 

Fortunately, one of the girls beside her, named Summer, managed to hear 
her. &quot;Who are you talking about, Holly? Who&#39;s new?&quot; 

Holly-Raine pointed over to Anna, who was walking inside the main 
building. &quot;That girl over there. The one that just walked inside... who 
is she?&quot; 

Summer shrugged her shoulders. &quot;I dunno. But... I do remember Miss 
Harding saying something about a transfer student from Minnesota. Maybe 
that&#39;s her.&quot; 

Holly-Raine smiled. &quot;She is...? Ooh... a newbie... oh god, and she&#39;s so 
cute. Since Sharon isn&#39;t coming back until Friday, I can get to know 
her better...&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I bet.&quot; Summer said sarcastically, rolling her eyes. &quot;That&#39;s 
girl&#39;s probably the only one in this entire school whose tongue hasn&#39;t 
been thrust up your-&quot; 

The other girl of the three, Jenny, quickly clamped her hand around 
Summer&#39;s mother to keep her from finishing her sentence. &quot;Eh... you 
just be carefully, Holly.&quot; Jenny interjected. &quot;You don&#39;t want Sharon to 
get angry when she comes back, do ya?&quot; 

Holly-Raine looked back innocently. &quot;What are you talking about? I love 
Sharon.&quot; 

Once again, Summer tried to speak. &quot;So then why the hell are you hot 
for-&quot; And once again, Jenny, who once again offered her own two cents, 
cut off Summer. &quot;Y-You do what you want, Holly. I&#39;m just being a busy 
body. But, I can tell ya that the new girl is in our History class. 
Miss Harding said she was an A-grade student, too.&quot; 

&quot;She is?&quot; Holly smiled. &quot;That&#39;s great... maybe she can help me with my 
History homework then, because I&#39;m failing it. And there are other 
things I need help with.&quot; 

Summer rolled her eyes. &quot;Like one-on-one biology?&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s that mean?&quot; Holly questioned.  

&quot;Nothing... nothing at all, Holly&#133;&quot; 

After throwing Summer a confused glare, Holly-Raine leapt off the bench 
table she was sitting on outside, pulling her bag along with her. It 
was only three minutes till lessons started, so she had to get moving 
quickly. But still, Holly was not concerned with lesson, or about 
flunking History. All she could think about was the sexy little number 
that had transferred into Atlantic High. And it made her very unaware 
of how wet her pure cotton undies were getting. 

********** 

&quot;Greetings, class. How was your weekend?&quot; 

The class replied to the teaching, Miss Harding, collectively, in that 
drab, monotone style they usually used. &quot;Fine, Miss.&quot; 

Miss Harding smiled elegantly. In all respects, Miss Harding was a very 
conservative kind of teacher. She was in her early thirties, at the 
maturing age of 34, but all the same, Miss Harding was a very 
attractive woman. Her long locks of raven black hair cascaded down onto 
her supple shoulders, hair which she occasionally tossed in a display 
of &#39;sexiness&#39; every now and again. Her body was all you could expect of 
a woman and more. Her figure was curvy and bouncing, her large but firm 
heaving breasts were held tightly against her chest. Miss Harding&#39;s 
long silky legs brandished the brilliant tan she had acquired during 
her holiday in Spain, two weeks ago. Aside from her smooth legs, the 
rest of her more suggestive body parts were cut off from sight by a 
formal grey suit. The only thing feminine about her suit was the short 
skirt it had. Normally she wore this, but every Friday she wore a much 
more revealing outfit. Unsurprisingly, attendance shot up every Friday. 

Though she was a sexy seductress, Miss Harding had an ostensible belief 
in strict discipline and learning. Hard as it was to believe, she had 
actually come to this school to teach kids something. And the students 
did like her. Even though she had a disturbing tendency to fall prey to 
hard-ass syndrome.  

The attractive teacher adjusted her glasses a little, then moved over 
to her desk, and laid her hands down on it, staring into the class. 
Everyone was here, even Holly-Raine who did have a late-streak 
recently. Unusually for Holly, she had some real focus today, so she 
must have been excited about something, whatever it was. 

Rather than dwell on that, Miss Harding began the class. &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
all enjoyed your weekend. You&#39;ll need to enjoy those breaks because we 
have a lot of work to catch up on. First of all, you should know that I 
have spoken to the board, and they have decided the topics for the 
History Report due in on the 30th of November.&quot; 

One of the students of the class spoke out, though her voice was timid. 
&quot;What are they, miss?&quot; 

&quot;I was just getting to that. You have a choice of either a report of 
1930-40&#39;s Nazi Germany, or the Industrial expansion during the 1800&#39;s. 
Neither one of them are particularly appealing to you, I can imagine.&quot; 

The whole class let out a collective groan. That was an understatement. 
Both sounded boring as all hell. Which was no comfort, considering how 
important that this History report was. Just when Miss Harding was 
about to say something to the class, Holly threw up her hand to call 
for attention. 

Miss Harding smiled secretively. To say that Holly-Raine was popular 
with the majority of the populous in this school was another 
understatement. &quot;You have a question, Holly?&quot; 

Holly-Raine put her arm down, and flicked with the pen on her desk. &quot;I 
was wondering, miss, you said something about a new student last week?&quot; 

Miss Harding blinked. &quot;My goodness, I forgot.&quot; Then she turned to look 
at the door. Anna was waiting by the outside of the door patiently, 
waiting for Miss Harding to let her in and introduce her. The teacher 
smiled nervously and waved for Anna to come in. The new student placed 
her hand on the doorknob and pulled it, walking into the room. The 
voluptuous young girl met a new haze of stares from the other of girls, 
but mostly from Holly-Raine as she walked up to the blackboard, next to 
Miss Harding. 

Miss Harding turned to look back at the class. &quot;Okay, class. This is 
Anna Michaels. She is a new pupil who just came to us from Greenvale, 
Minnesota. I hope you will make her feel welcome here.&quot; The teacher 
then stared around to find a seat for Anna. &quot;Is there a vacant seat?&quot; 

Some of the other girls were ready to recommend the seats next to them, 
but Holly-Raine was far too quick for them. The youthful schoolgirl 
quickly launched herself onto her feet. &quot;There&#39;s a free desk right next 
to mine, Miss Harding.&quot; 

&quot;Excellent. Anna, why don&#39;t you take a seat over there.&quot; 

Anna nodded politely. &quot;Okay.&quot; 

Holly&#39;s hungry green eyes followed the keen movements of Anna as she 
strolled over to her. It was hard to imagine, but Holly-Raine was 
insanely smitten by this newbie already. They hadn&#39;t even met yet and 
already Holly was conceiving dreamily perfect visions of this girl. But 
then again, nobody as cute as this girl had ever appeared in Atlantic 
High. Anna stood at the same height as Holly-Raine, 5&#39;&#39; and her body 
was exquisitely delectable. She walked with an unintentional 
seductiveness with long, smooth creamy legs. Her cute breasts were 
small and firm; her thighs were gently curved and moulded well into the 
figure of her behind, a behind that most men who had seen Anna 
described as &#39;one cute little ass&#39;. Her sweet little angel-like face 
was inescapably beautiful, marked by her full, slightly rosy cheeks, 
shining bright sapphire blue eyes, and her bounding mane of golden 
blonde hair. This all contributed to the brimming vision of perfection 
known as Anna. And Holly-Raine was not the first to fall prey to it; 
chances were that she wouldn&#39;t be the last.  

Though it seemed to Holly that Anna was moving in slow motion, Anna 
came to stop right before the desk next to her own. Anna opened the 
desk and chucked in her small book bag. After taking a seat, Anna 
looked over at Holly-Raine and smiled. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; She whispered, her sweet voice sending shivers down 
Holly&#39;s spine. 

Before Holly-Raine could respond, Miss Harding began the class again, 
addressing the group of young girls. &quot;Okay, girls. This is how we will 
proceed. Each project you submit, whether it is about Germany or 
Industrialization, will be at least 8,000 words in length. I expect it 
to be typed out on computer, if you have no access to one at home then 
use one in the library. The deadline, as I have said, is the 30th of 
November. I want you all to understand how important this is to your 
final...&quot; 

Holly-Raine blocked out the ramblings of Miss Harding. Even though she 
was sitting forward, her gaze was locked onto Anna from the corner of 
her eyes. Holly was almost delirious with these thoughts of Anna. Anna 
herself was paying attention to Miss Harding, as was the rest of the 
class, but Holly was too caught up with Anna to even care. Suddenly all 
these feelings then began to spring up in the young girl&#39;s mind. 
Thoughts of Anna, slowly singing to a love song on the radio... in the 
shower. Thoughts of her revealing that clothed figure on the beach, 
accentuating those perky little tits in a skimpy pink bikini. Thoughts 
of Anna clutching bed sheets in ecstasy as her lower sheath was given 
the best tongue thrashing of its life.  

Strange as it was, Holly was not controlling herself well around Anna 
right now. In fact, the more she stared at Anna, the hornier it made 
her. Soon the pressure just got to be too much. Holly had to release 
some of it, otherwise she&#39;s probably jump Anna&#39;s bones right in the 
middle of the classroom. With a reluctant sigh, Holly released the grip 
her left hand had on her pen, and slipped it underneath her desk. It 
was a stupid thing to do, really, but Holly-Raine didn&#39;t much care 
right about now. All she could think of was how much she wanted a piece 
of this new girl. Holly&#39;s desk was at the back row, and in the corner 
of the room, so there was little chance she could be caught, but it was 
still risky. With her eyes still locked on Anna, Holly-Raine slid her 
soft hand against her firm stomach, rubbing it a bit, and then pushed 
her hand down into her panties.  

The brown-haired teen released as sigh of hidden contentment, as her 
little hand pressed against the soft folds of her honey pot. 
Unsurprisingly, she was wet down there, the only thing surprising about 
it was how wet she had gotten, in such a short amount of time (which 
really was short since Holly-Raine had seen Anna only ten minutes ago). 
Though she tried hard to keep quiet, Holly let out little gasps as her 
fingers worked in slow motions against her wet snatch. Holly was too 
far gone to be able to stop herself, but she did have the courage to 
avoid her clit. Holly-Raine was very sensitive. From the way she was 
feeling now, flicking at that organ might cause her to scream. Holly 
shut one of her eyes, and bit her lip to silence herself as she pulled 
apart her pussy lips with her index and wedding ring fingers, then 
pushed her middle finger into her sopping folds.  

All of a sudden, more of Holly-Raine&#39;s mischievous thoughts were 
circulating in her brain. Her eager eyes studied Anna&#39;s body once more, 
picturing what the other girl would look like stripped naked in front 
of her. Holly pictured Anna&#39;s face contorting as a tongue was flicking 
at her little love spot down below. All these ideas simply fuelled 
Holly&#39;s lust.  

Luckily for Holly, nobody, not even Anna or Miss Harding, was noticing 
what was going on under her desk, but to be honest, nobody would have 
been surprised if they did happen to catch her. Holly had quite a... 
reputation in this school. Holly squirmed on her seat a bit as she felt 
her body&#39;s response to her finger games. She was prepared to climax, 
already. As Holly continued to play with herself lustfully, her gaze 
finally dropped from Anna, and onto her desk, her slow gasps becoming 
painfully light moans. Then, with one final thrust, Holly&#39;s body jerked 
lightly, as she found her blessed release. In a short few seconds, the 
absorbing of her fresh gobs of milky teenage cum darkened Holly-Raine&#39;s 
white cotton panties. Hard as it was, she slowly withdrew her hand from 
her warm pussy and soaked panties, releasing a small sigh. Opening her 
eye again, Holly-Raine&#39;s bright green eyes stared around the classroom, 
just to see if anyone had caught her. Everything was normal.  

After breathing another sigh, Holly clamped her legs together before 
any of her cum slipped down her legs. Since the class was expected to 
start work on their projects, it meant that History class would end in 
a few minutes, so that they could do some research in the library. That 
gave her a chance to clean up. It was then though, that Holly began to 
wonder who she would be paired up with, which was the point at which 
Miss Harding&#39;s talk began to phase back into her mind.  

&quot;...And so these are the recommendations I&#39;m making. Anvil and Jacob, 
their book, My Leader, is a brilliant source of information on Hitler&#39;s 
rise to power and the strength of the Nazi state. As for 
Industrialisation, you should look up anything by Paul Tomlinson. Good. 
Now that we have sorted that out, I want you to go up to the library to 
research your topic. You may choose either, but I want you to submit a 
plan for your project by the end of the week. The pairings are as 
follows.&quot; 

Miss Harding picked up her register from on her desk, and began to read 
out the pairings she had formulated last night in preparation for the 
class. &quot;Summer and Jenny. You&#39;re the first pairing. Jackie and Sarah, 
you&#39;re the next. Holly and Anna, you&#39;re the third, Sherri and Amy 
you&#39;re...&quot; 

Holly blinked. She and Anna were working together? &quot;...Oh yeah...&quot; The 
brown haired girl said under her breath. &quot;...Anna...&quot; 

The innocent Anna, who was completely unaware that Holly-Raine had just 
masturbated from thinking about her, turned to look at her new 
project-partner, with an unknowing smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad we can work 
together.&quot; 

Holly smiled back (though her smile was less charming as it was 
provocative) trying her best to hide her cum-covered hand from sight. 
&quot;Oh me too!&quot; Holly said cheerfully. &quot;...I&#39;m really looking forward to 
it...&quot; 

Miss Harding then finished her declarations for the partner work. 
&quot;Those are the pairs that you have all been assigned to. You all may 
now leave to do some research in the library. Aside from Anna. I would 
like to speak with in private.&quot; 

&quot;Y-Yes miss.&quot; Anna nodded, with a hint of worry. She hoped that she 
really had not done anything wrong already. At least she didn&#39;t think 
that she did. All the same, the class divided themselves into pairs, 
although not all of them were happy about the pairings. Soon enough, 
they all filled out of the classroom, walking out into the corridor and 
over to the stairs that led up to the library. The last one to leave 
was Holly-Raine, who was walking in an odd way, mostly to prevent her 
cum from dripping down her legs any more than it had.  

But before she left to get to the toilets, she gave one last look at 
Anna. &quot;I&#39;ll meet you up at the library, okay?&quot; 

Anna just nodded, her attention more on what Miss Harding had to say to 
her. Holly sauntered out of the classroom in a slow pace, which 
quickened the second she passed through the door. Soon all who were 
left was Miss Harding and Anna. The older woman walked over to the door 
and shut it quietly. Anna got the feeling that Miss Harding knew how 
nervous she was, and was making her stew about it. But quickly enough, 
Miss Harding was walking up to the younger girl, leaning back on the 
desk right in front of her. 

Anna&#39;s eyes lowered and she gave off a slight blush as Miss Harding&#39;s 
body reached within a short few centimetres of her own. She wasn&#39;t 
afraid of cleavage or anything, but her new teacher just... didn&#39;t seem 
to mind how she handled her body. It was like Miss Harding lacked 
feminine poise. Even through the class, when she was sitting at her 
desk, the teacher&#39;s legs were parted slightly, and the hand gestures 
she made often seemed to linger at her chest.  

If Miss Harding was aware that she was making Anna uncomfortable, she 
certainly wasn&#39;t showing it from her body language. &quot;How have you been 
settling in, Anna?&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot;  

Miss Harding repeated herself. &quot;I said how have you been settling in 
here?&quot; 

&quot;Oh... um...&quot; Anna was half-expecting to be scolded for something. 
&quot;Atlantic High is very nice, nobody has caused me any problems. But 
it&#39;s still early.&quot; 

&quot;I meant how you were settling in Victoria.&quot; 

From that confused glare, the teacher decided to reinforce that with an 
explanation. &quot;It&#39;s just that your mother told me that you enjoyed 
attending your previous school. Is that right.&quot; 

Anna merely nodded.  

&quot;I see. Well, I just want you to know that you don&#39;t have to worry. The 
pupils in this school are a very caring bunch, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll get 
on well with your other teachers. You&#39;ve already won me over with your 
brilliant attention span.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you... Miss Harding.&quot; 

The dark haired teacher stood up from her leaning position, and then 
bent her legs at the knees slightly, to look at Anna by eyelevel. The 
older woman gave off a bright, comforting smile, more or less unaware 
that she was giving Anna a clear view of her healthy, bouncing breasts. 
&quot;You don&#39;t have to thank me, Anna. I want you to enjoy your time at 
Atlantic High because you see... you&#39;re never going to fit in if you&#39;re 
so tense and anxious.&quot; The teacher&#39;s hand surreptitiously went through 
her locks of long black hair. &quot;...Because we all like to loosen up 
every now and again... do you understand?&quot; 

Anna just nodded. She really didn&#39;t understand, but... &quot;Y-Yes miss.&quot; 

&quot;Now why don&#39;t you go and join the rest of the class up in the library. 
I&#39;ll be up in fifteen minutes to check up on you all.&quot; 

********** 

A good ten minutes later, Miss Harding&#39;s History class had made their 
way up to the library and hand begun work on their projects. Most had 
chosen to work on the Hitler&#39;s Germany topic, because they assumed it 
would be easier to work around. And so the studying began. Anna was 
already knee-deep in a couple of books she had found in the History 
section, and she began to read them, waiting for Holly-Raine to come 
and find her.  

By all accounts, her first day had been going rather smoothly. Just as 
she suspected they would, all of the girls at this school were kind and 
cheerful. On the way up the stairs, a couple of girls named Summer and 
Jenny had asked Anna to eat lunch at their table later on in the day. 
It seemed as if this alteration between her old school and Atlantic 
High was going to go off without a hitch. The young blonde girl flicked 
over the page as she finished reading it, and jotted down a few notes 
on some loose sheets of paper, that were scattered on the table she was 
sitting at.  

&quot;Hey!&quot; 

Anna looked up at whomever it was that called to her. It was 
Holly-Raine. Anna smiled a bit from seeing her. Holly was quite 
friendly, maybe a little more than the rest of the class. Though she 
was a bit weird. Anna heard Holly moaning a bit in class, but 
respectfully ignored it. She just assumed that Holly had hurt herself 
somehow. Whatever. The blonde smiled back at Holly-Raine. 

&quot;Hello.&quot; She said sweetly. &quot;I&#39;ve already gotten started, and made a few 
notes.&quot;  

Holly-Raine took a seat, just near enough to Anna without being *too* 
close. After she got out of the class, Holly made her way to the 
toilets and got herself cleaned up. Still, there was a lust that Holly 
grooming for Anna. And it was going to show itself very soon, if she 
didn&#39;t do something to control it. She still didn&#39;t even know if Anna 
was into girls, but she could always come around. Holly took a lot 
through the books on the table. They were all thick, lacked pictures 
and were probably about as exciting as they looked.  

&quot;Uh...&quot; Holly started. &quot;Could we find some other books? I really don&#39;t 
feel like trudging through all of that right now. My brain is not in 
gear.&quot; 

Anna smiled at Holly&#39;s joke, and looked up at the bookcase that held 
some of the newer, easier to understand History books. Rather than 
trouble Holly, Anna stood up off her chair and walked over to the 
bookcase. Holly&#39;s smile turned into a grin as Anna stood before the 
bookcase, standing on her tiptoes to reach a suitable book. As she 
stretched to reach the book, the small blue shirt Anna was wearing rose 
up a bit, giving a clear view of the small of her back. And, if that 
was not enough, Anna&#39;s current position hiked up her skirt every time 
she reached for the book. Holly had to lean down a bit to get a better 
look, but what she did see was enough.  

Holly-Raine jerked back up into a sitting position when Anna finally 
reached the book. Ever present with that gentle smile, Anna handed over 
the slightly thinner History book to a steamy Holly. 

&quot;Thanks...&quot; Holly said with a pleasant smile. &quot;I hear that you&#39;re great 
at History, Anna.&quot; 

Anna blushed a little. She never really realized that her reputation 
had followed her to Victoria. &quot;It&#39;s nothing worth mentioning. I&#39;m not 
that great at History. I just love the lesson, so I try really hard to 
do well at it. I suppose you must think I&#39;m some sort of geek, since I 
like History so much.&quot; 

&quot;Not at all. I think it&#39;s kinda cute.&quot; 

Anna&#39;s blush deepened again. This time however, Holly-Raine was able to 
pick up on it. Anna seemed to be effected by complements. That boded 
well for Holly. Though Anna did not realized this, Holly had set her 
hungry, lust filled eyes on the blonde. In time, it was perhaps only a 
matter of time, till Holly-Raine had Anna at her mercy. So of course, 
Holly had to devise a plan... 

&quot;Hey...&quot; Holly began sneakily. &quot;I&#39;m never really good at this sort of 
thing. History is a class that I&#39;m failing. So, how about we do some 
extra work outside of school, huh? Maybe at your place?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t see any harm in that. That will be great.&quot;

Holly smiled again as Anna got back to work. This girl was a student 
who took her work seriously. There was no way that Holly could get to 
her while she was so wrapped up in all this. If they were in a more 
light-hearted environment, Holly-Raine was sure she could get what she 
wanted. With that same smile of quiet anticipation, Holly flicked open 
the History book and began to search for her chosen topic. Though she 
said nothing, the dampening of her cotton white panties gave away her 
intentions for later on.</pre>
