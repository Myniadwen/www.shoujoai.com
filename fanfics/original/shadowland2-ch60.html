<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 60 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch59.html">Back to Part 59</a><pre>Amber barely got a wink of sleep that night; her mind was filled with 
images of Jessica and the thought of soon being back in the girl&#39;s arms. 
She reflected on all the things she would say to the girl when she saw 
her again. At first she considered yelling at Jessica for running away 
and leaving them to suffer all on they&#39;re own, but decided against it. 
She did not want to scare Jessica off when the girl finally returned 
home on her own. That was not to say that Amber was not angry with 
Jessica, she would rather deal with that issue when they were far away 
from this place. First off, they needed to escape this place, and then 
she would have a word with Jessie about her running away.

A smile played across her face as she envisioned where they would go 
after running away together. She imagined them all living together in a 
large house by a lake with many trees all around. Penny and Kim would 
have their own room together and so would Jessica and herself, while the 
rest of the girls would get their own rooms, if they liked. The house 
would have white walls and large open windows to allow the breeze to 
enter during the summer months. There would also be a large bench swing 
out on the patio that the girls could play on, their summer dresses 
swaying in the wind. No longer would there be shadows to haunted them or 
people to tell them that it was wrong to love someone as deeply as she 
loved Jessie. As her mind drifted over her imaginary world she was 
unaware of the sun&#39;s slow progression into a new day and that soon the 
outside world would begin to rising and she became startled out of her 
dreams by a knocking at the door. 

&quot;Rise and shine girls!&quot; Ma&#39;am exclaimed as she opened the door, &quot;I want 
you all dressed and cleaned up before I return.&quot; She commanded. 

Groggily the girl&#39;s began to rise from their slumbers. Amber quickly got 
to her feet when a wave of dizziness overwhelmed her and she nearly fell 
over when Sarah rushed to the girl&#39;s side and help her steady herself, 
&quot;You going to be alright?&quot; Sarah inquired of her sister. 

Amber nodded and yawned, &quot;I didn&#39;t sleep too well is all.&quot; She explained 
sleepily. 

Ma&#39;am crossed the room to look upon Amber&#39;s tired face, &quot;We&#39;re you up 
all night talking again, Amber?&quot; The woman inquired coldly. 

Amber shook her head and steadied herself with the dresser as another 
wave of wooziness washed over her, &quot;N... no, Ma&#39;am.&quot; She replied 
sleepily, her eyes fell upon Kim as the girl wiped the sleep in her 
eyes, &quot;Kim was having nightmares so I stayed up with her to make sure 
she was alright.&quot; She half lied. 

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Ma&#39;am remarked with a stern nod, then turned to Kim, 
&quot;Kimberly, are you alright dear?&quot; She inquired gently. 

Kim slowly nodded as she rubbed at her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m sorry to cause so much 
trouble.&quot; She apologized, unsure as to what had happened over night, her 
mind fuzzy and she felt in a daze.

Ma&#39;am knelt next to the girl, &quot;You are no trouble at all.&quot; She assured 
the girl and patted her on the leg, &quot;Have a quick shower to wake 
yourself and remember you are safe here so there is nothing to be afraid 
of.&quot; She raised to her full height, &quot;Isn&#39;t that right girls?&quot; She 
inquired with a smile. 

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am.&quot; The girls lied, trying to conceal their true feelings 
about their home.

&quot;Good.&quot; Ma&#39;am beamed, &quot;It looks like I have the day off today so you 
girls can spend the day downstairs. That is if you get all your chores 
finished first, so let&#39;s hurry up and get going. Move those butts.&quot; She 
ushered April into the washroom then headed out of the room, &quot;I want you 
all cleaned up before I return, is that clear?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ma&#39;am.&quot; 

Satisfied with the response Ma&#39;am left the room and closed the door 
behind her. 

Amber noted right off that she did not hear the click of the lock, &quot;This 
is perfect.&quot; She said under her breath, not sure if Ma&#39;am was still 
listening behind the door. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you find it strange,&quot; Sarah whispered worriedly, &quot;The day Jessica 
returns Ma&#39;am has the day off?&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s a miracle.&quot; Amber breathed, suddenly felling more awake 
then before. The very thought that she could met up with Jessica so 
early made her heart race, &quot;I get the shower first.&quot; She called out as 
she rushed passed the sleepy girls, into the washroom and turned on the 
water. 

Sarah shook her head, &quot;I have a bad feeling about this.&quot; She muttered. 

Kim sat upon the edge of the bed and stretched, her entire body ached in 
ways that she never felt before. She glanced down at her arm to see a 
strange burn mark on her wrist, then she remembered her battle with 
Akaime and quickly scanned around the room until her eyes fell upon the 
belt draped over the head of the bed. She reached out and gingerly 
picked it up, watching the way the light reflected off the metal star at 
the end, &quot;I really found it.&quot; She stated nervously. 

Penny wrapped her arms around Kim&#39;s neck from behind and kissed the girl 
on the cheek, &quot;I knew you could find it.&quot; She stated proudly, &quot;I knew 
you were not lying to me when you promised to find it.&quot; She added, then 
took the belt from Kim&#39;s hands and looked it over, &quot;But what was it 
doing in the washroom?&quot; She inquired curiously. 

&quot;Akaime had it.&quot; Kimberly remarked weakly, rubbing her head in 
confusion, she could feel there was something else she was forgetting. 

Sarah sat next to the girl, &quot;Who is A... kai.. may?&quot; She inquired, 
interested to learn what that black mass in the tub was. 

&quot;A monster.&quot; Kim replied simply, &quot;A man that Natalie and I fought back 
at our home.&quot; She blinked a few times and searched the room then 
abruptly got to her feet, &quot;Natalie? Jenn?&quot; Her eyes darted around the 
room, &quot;Where are they? Where is everyone?&quot; She exclaimed as she recalled 
her friends from the Western Dorm.

Sarah placed an arm around the girl&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Calm down. You&#39;re home 
now.&quot; She stated, &quot;Here with me, Amber, April, Caitlin and Penny.&quot; 

&quot;Penny?&quot; Kim suddenly recalled how she got in that nightmare and spun 
around to face Penny. She took the girl&#39;s hand in her own and looked the 
girl in the eyes, &quot;Of course. Penny. I came here to find Jenn and stayed 
behind because of you, while Jessica and someone else escaped to help 
Jennifer.&quot; Kim&#39;s head started to hurt as she tried to recall whom the 
other person was, &quot;Why can&#39;t I remember?&quot; She inquired in frustration. 

&quot;What are you going on about?&quot; Sarah inquired nervously, &quot;You were 
brought here after your parents died, remember?&quot; She reminded the girl. 

&quot;No!&quot; Kim cried out, &quot;That is all wrong. I ran away after my parents 
died and met Lauren and she... we...&quot; She suddenly remembered making 
love for the first time and flushed, then heavily sat upon the bed. She 
clamped her hands to the sides of her head, &quot;None of this makes any 
sense.&quot; Tears streamed down her face as conflicting images filled her 
mind, &quot;Who am I?&quot; She sobbed in frustration. 

Penny sat down next to the girl and wrapped her arms around her, &quot;You 
are Kimberly, the girl I love.&quot; She stated firmly. 

Kim looked into Penny&#39;s eyes, &quot;How can you say that?&quot; She inquired 
uneasily, &quot;How can you even know me when I don&#39;t even know myself.&quot; 

Penny flushed then leaned in close Kim, &quot;Because I know this.&quot; She 
lightly placed a kiss upon the girl&#39;s lips. 

A mixture of warmth and pleasure filled Kim&#39;s heart and mind; she placed 
a hand lightly upon Penny&#39;s cheek and deepened the kiss. This was real 
Kim thought to herself and she suddenly did not care about anything else 
her mind told her, because this felt right. She pushed Penny to the bed 
and let her tongue slip into the girl&#39;s mouth. 

&quot;Ahem!!&quot; Sarah cleared her throat, &quot;Could you two hold off the love 
making? Ma&#39;am could return at any time you know?&quot; 

Kim pulled back from Penny and moved to the far corner of the bed, &quot;I... 
I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She blushed brightly in embarrassment. She ran her hand 
across her face then bit down on her knuckle hard enough to force some 
form of control upon herself. She caught a faint whiff of Penny upon her 
fingers and quivered as the memory of her taste entered her mind. Lauren 
may have been the first time she had made love, but Penny will always be 
the first time she ever tasted such a flavour. The mere scent of the 
girl upon her figures made her yearn for more. She hungrily looked up to 
see Penny staring at her, quickly she hide her hand behind her back and 
reddened even more. 

Amber stepped out of the washroom while running a towel through her 
hair, &quot;Shower is free.&quot; She stated as she wrapped the towel around her 
body. She spotted the restlessness in Penny and Kim the moment she set 
her eyes on them, &quot;Kim, I think you look like you need one next.&quot; She 
remarked as she crossed the room and took the girl by the hand. 

&quot;Huh? Wha?&quot; Kim allowed herself to be pulled into the washroom where 
Amber closed the door behind her and glared at the girl, &quot;What...?&quot; Kim 
inquired nervously. 

&quot;I know that look.&quot; Amber remarked sternly, &quot;You had better keep 
yourself under control, you hear?&quot; Amber warned. 

&quot;How could you tell?&quot; Kim asked in disconcertion. 

&quot;It&#39;s written all over your face.&quot; Amber stated with a sigh, &quot;I 
understand what you are going through, but you need to show some control 
or Ma&#39;am will discover your secret and then things will get much worse 
for you.&quot; She explained as she pulled the shower curtain closed and 
turned on the shower, &quot;Now get in.&quot; She playfully commanded. 

Kim stripped off her nightshirt and entered the tub, &quot;God!!! It is 
freezing!!&quot; She exclaimed in shock. 

&quot;It will cool you off.&quot; Amber remarked with a nod, &quot;Trust me. You need 
it.&quot; She stated, shaking her head helplessly. She did not know if she 
could handle another Jessica in her life, but if she could help it she 
would keep this one from getting in as much trouble as the other. Which 
reminded her that Jessica was awaiting her in the shed, &quot;Wash up 
quickly, alright?&quot; She stated to Kim as she left the room to search for 
some clothes. 

Sarah shook her head in disbelief, &quot;That one is worse then Jessie.&quot; She 
remarked with distaste. 

&quot;She is not.&quot; Penny protested boldly, &quot;She&#39;s more then Jessie could ever 
be.&quot; 

Amber stood between the girls, &quot;We don&#39;t have time for arguments you 
two.&quot; She stated firmly, &quot;Get washed up and dressed or we&#39;ll be in 
trouble with Ma&#39;am&quot; 

Penny lowered her head, &quot;Sorry...&quot; She started to head for the washroom 
when Amber stepped in front of the door.

&quot;You may want to stay away from Kim for a bit, just while around Ma&#39;am.&quot; 
Amber warned the girl. 

Anger filled Penny&#39;s eyes, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me what to do.&quot; She returned 
irately, &quot;I&#39;m not like you. I can keep Kim under control.&quot; 

Amber glared at the girl, &quot;This is not a game Penny.&quot; She stated coldly, 
&quot;You want to know what will happen if Ma&#39;am finds out about your little 
girlfriend? Huh? She will lock Kim away in the cupboard and then guess 
what our brothers will do with you afterwards if they think their little 
secret has been leaked out?&quot; She remarked bluntly.

Tears filled Penny&#39;s eyes, &quot;I just want to be close to her is all.&quot; She 
cried, &quot;It isn&#39;t fair.&quot; 

Amber hugged the girl closely, &quot;I know... I know...&quot; She wanted to tell 
the girl that everything would be all right, that Jessica has returned 
and she would make sure they all escape this nightmare once and for all, 
but she did not want to get the girl&#39;s hopes up too soon. So instead she 
kept her mouth shut and hugged the girl as tight as she could.
