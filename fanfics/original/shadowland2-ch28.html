<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 2 - A Tale of Sorrows (part 28 of 67)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch27.html">Back to Part 27</a><pre>Kimberly stumbled down the Western dorm stairs taking them three at a 
time, nearly tripping along the way and stumbling into the lobby door. 
She tore the door opened and rushed into the lobby, &quot;NATALIE!!&quot; She 
cried out desperately searching for her friend. 

Kima jumped to her feet, &quot;Kimberly?!? What is it?&quot; She inquired, sensing 
the worry in her twin as she rushed to the girl&#39;s side. &quot;Is something 
wrong?&quot;

&quot;Jenn...&quot; Kim panted as she tried to catch her breath, &quot;She&#39;s in 
trouble.&quot; 

Kima helped her double to the couches, &quot;Natalie and Kris are on looking 
for her. She will be fine.&quot; 

Kim shook her head and took a deep breath, &quot;May&#39;s back!!&quot; She declared 
fearfully. 

&quot;What?&quot; Kima exclaimed in confusion, &quot;But those Sisters took her, didn&#39;t 
they?&quot;

Kim nodded, &quot;But I saw May with Jenn in a dream.&quot; She explained 
frantically, &quot;She&#39;s trying to convince Jenn to come with her.&quot; 

Alyson sat up from her spot on the couch, &quot;It might be a fragment of her 
memories trying to trick her.&quot; She explained calmly, &quot;My brother 
probably triggered something in her mind when he met her. Hopefully 
Natalie and the others will get to her before him. They should be able 
to rescue Jenn.&quot;

&quot;But we can&#39;t just wait around here.&quot; Kimberly exclaimed. 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kima agreed, &quot;May seems like the type that would do anything to 
get her way. I mean she even tried to kill us just because we entered 
Jenn&#39;s dreams before.&quot; 

&quot;But how do we get to her?&quot; Kim inquired desperately, &quot;Something pushed 
me out of her dreams like I was nothing?&quot; 

&quot;Something pushed you?&quot; Alyson inquired eager to learn more, &quot;What could 
shove someone from a dream? Only the dreamer should be able to force 
another out of a dream.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Kim explained frantically, &quot;It was a face made out of 
coloured glass. It told me to leave then I was thrown backwards.&quot;  

&quot;That means a direct route is out of the questions.&quot; Alyson commented as 
she scanned the room in search of some clue to how they might get around 
such a force when her eyes fell upon Penny and Jessica, &quot;You can use 
them.&quot; She nodded at the sleeping girls, &quot;If you jump into their dreams 
you should be able to work your way around to Jenn&#39;s dreams. &quot; 

Kima rushed around to Penny&#39;s side with Kimberly close beside her, &quot;How 
do we do that?&quot; She asked frantically, &quot;I have never entered someone 
dreams on my own.&quot; 

&quot;It has always been by accident.&quot; Kim concluded her twin&#39;s statement. 

Alyson shook her head in frustration, &quot;You two have been wandering 
through dreams without even knowing how?&quot; She rubbed her forehead as she 
tried to force down the anger that started to surface, &quot;Maybe this is 
not such a good idea. Sling shooting off someone&#39;s dreams can be 
dangerous and I can&#39;t come with you like this.&quot; She gestured to her leg 
and arm.

&quot;We have no other choice.&quot; Kima stated, getting more agitated by the 
moment, &quot;Please tell us what we need to do.&quot; She begged.

Alyson shifted in her seat so she faced the girls, &quot;You sure about this? 
You do realize the dangers you could be up against.&quot; Alyson warned, &quot;We 
found a bugbear in that girl&#39;s room and where there is one there are 
sure to be several more inside her mind.&quot; 

Kima nodded firmly, &quot;I will kill every last one of them if I have too.&quot; 
She declared with a gleam of hatred in her eyes. 

Alyson turned to Kim, &quot;What about you?&quot; She inquired, &quot;You willing to 
fight through yet another nightmare for Jenn?&quot; 

Kim&#39;s face grew long as she recalled the first time she encountered May, 
then she remembered how Jenn fought to protect her from Lauren even when 
she did not really know Kim. Seriousness crossed her face and she gave a 
stern nod, &quot;I will do anything for Jenn. I&#39;ve hurt her to much and wish 
I could at least try to be there for her as she was for me.&quot; 

&quot;Alright then.&quot; Alyson said, satisfied by what she heard, &quot;You&#39;ve 
already got the heart. You just need to follow it. You both experienced 
her dreams first hand.&quot; She stated pointing at Penny, &quot;Now you just need 
to close your eyes and concentrate on the emotion you felt while you 
were there. If your intent is clear, and your mind not clouded, you 
should easily pass through the girl&#39;s dreams. When you are there you 
will need to find the door that leads to the Hall of Mirrors. It is a 
maze filled with fog and lots of strange looking mirrors.&quot; 

&quot;We know of the place.&quot; Kima assured giving Kim a broad grin, which Kim 
returned with a weaker smile, &quot;Kim knows how to reach Jenn from there. 
Right, Kim?&quot;

Kim reluctantly nodded as she recalled the dark path she would need to 
walk once again.

&quot;Good.&quot; Alyson remarked, &quot;Then I do not have to explain what you may 
have to face there. Just try to find Jenn as quickly as you can and get 
out of there right away. Understood? Do not linger in that girl&#39;s dreams 
longer then you need too and try not to get too involved this time 
alright?&quot;

Kima flushed lightly, &quot;I&#39;ll try not to kiss anyone is that is what you 
mean.&quot; She stated with a roll of her eyes. 

&quot;Kim?&quot; Alyson glanced to the girl, &quot;You know what to do?&quot;

&quot;Y... yes... &quot; Kim stammered, she was uncertain about what exactly they 
were going to do but trusted that her other half would know when they 
got there. She laced her fingers between Kima&#39;s and closed her eyes. 

Kima smiled one more time at her twin then glanced down at Penny and a 
frown crossed her face, &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She apologized, then closed her 
eyes and lightly set a hand upon Penny&#39;s forehead. Instantly she could 
feel Penny&#39;s emotions rush through her fingertips, like wild fire it 
raced over her body engulfing her heart in a series of emotions. Before 
Kima was even prepared a wave of darkness enveloped her hand and quickly 
crawled over her skin. Kima tried to pull her hand away only to find it 
stuck fast to the girl. She felt revulsion as something slick and wet 
coated her arm moving across her chest. Within second she could feel 
cold fingers all over her flesh and she needed to clench her muscle in 
an attempt to keep herself from running away. Abruptly she recoiled from 
the girl and fell to the ground, her mind reeled as the sensation of a 
million hands crawled over her skin overcame her. She felt a well of 
disgust fill up in the pit of her stomach and she could taste vomit rise 
up in the back of her throat. It took every ounce of her strength to 
keep herself from throwing up. She trashed about upon the ground in an 
attempt to regain control of her body and shake the crawling feeling 
from herself. Finally tears began to stream down the sides of her face 
and she let out a terrified scream. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot; A voice cut through the haze that flooded Kima&#39;s 
mind, a soothing and familiar voice. 

Kima reached out her mind towards whoever it was and forced herself to 
open her eyes. There knelling above her was Penny. She rolled over on 
her knees and let out a dry cough that felt as if her entire insides 
were about to drop on the floor in front of her. Her mind raced as it 
tried to piece together what had just happened to her. She had not felt 
that awful since the last time her father touched her and even then she 
usually had some control over her body. This was like something else 
entirely. Her eyes darted to Penny and the long expression upon the 
girl&#39;s face, &quot;P... penny...&quot; She chocked as she reached out for the girl 
only to have her pull out of reach, &quot;P.. Penny... wait...&quot; She called 
out and tried to get her body to stand only to find her legs not 
responding and she fell to her side, curled up in a ball. 

&quot;A... are you alright?&quot; Penny repeated, moving timidly closer. 

Kima rolled over on her back and sucked in a shaky breath of mouldy air 
and for the first time she realized that they were in the dank basement 
again, &quot;I... it worked...&quot; She panted, staring up at the beams that 
crisscrossed the ceiling. She placed a hand to her forehead and tried to 
shake the feel that had overcome her, &quot;What the hell was that all 
about?&quot; She asked no one in particular and then forced herself into a 
seated position and glanced around, &quot;Kim?&quot;

Penny cocked her head curiously at Kima, &quot;Is that your name?&quot; Penny 
asked. 

Kima scratched the back of her head, &quot;Sort of.&quot; She replied, &quot;Actually I 
was referring to my... ummm...&quot; She considered how to explain her 
relation to Kimberly and decided that lying would probably be the best 
road to travel, &quot;She is my twin. We can here together.&quot;

&quot;She might be with the others.&quot; Penny explained sadly, then sat upon the 
ground with her back against a wooden crate, &quot;Only the bad girls are 
sent down here.&quot; She explained dismally. 

&quot;The bad girls?&quot; Kima massaged her legs and rubbed her arms, which still 
felt as if something was crawling over her skin, &quot;What did you do?&quot; 

Penny pulled her knees up close to her chest and buried her face in 
them.

&quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot; Kima inquired as she crawled over to the girl, 
forcing her limbs to move even though they didn&#39;t want to. Lightly she 
placed a hand upon Penny&#39;s shoulder and again Penny shrank away, &quot;I&#39;m 
not going to hurt you.&quot; Kima assured the girl. 

Penny peeked out from over her knees, &quot;Really?&quot; She inquired 
sceptically. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember me?&quot; Kima inquired, &quot;I was at the ball.&quot; 

&quot;The ball?&quot; There was a puzzled look upon Penny&#39;s face as she scanned 
Kima eyes.

Kima glanced at herself to find she was still in her pyjamas, &quot;I guess I 
don&#39;t look much like I did back then.&quot; She remarked remembering for the 
first time that she didn&#39;t have a chance to change yet, &quot;I was dressed 
in red with a red mask and you were wearing the most beautiful golden 
gown and there were golden leaves in your hair and a yellow feathered 
mask over your eyes.&quot; She let out a sigh at the thought of the sight of 
Penny in that dress. 

Penny&#39;s head popped up a bit and squinted at Kima as if she were trying 
to remember something, &quot;Red?&quot; She inquired curiously, &quot;I remember a girl 
in a red dress but she had longer hair.&quot; 

Kima blushed in embarrassment, &quot;Ummm... That was my twin...&quot; She 
stammered, &quot;I was in a suit with red gloves and a ruby mask.&quot; She shyly 
explained. 

Penny blinked for a moment then lightly touched her lips, &quot;Y... you 
kissed me...&quot; She remarked with a flush, &quot;But... your...&quot; Penny glanced 
up and down Kima&#39;s body, &quot;You&#39;re a girl, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

Kima&#39;s blush deepened and nervously scratched at the back of her head, 
&quot;Yeah... Sorry about that. I could not resist.&quot; She stated, feeling even 
more uncomfortable by the second, &quot;You were so beautiful.&quot; She admitted 
then gazed into the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;You are beautiful.&quot; She corrected 
herself.

&quot;No I&#39;m not.&quot; Penny retorted and preceded to bury her face between her 
knees again, &quot;I&#39;m ugly. A nightmare that would scare anyone away.&quot; 

Kima wrapped her arm around Penny&#39;s shoulder, &quot;No, you are not.&quot; She 
said into the girl&#39;s ear, &quot;When I saw you my heart raced. I never wanted 
to kiss someone as much as I did you.&quot;

Penny peeked up again, &quot;D... do you... really think so?&quot; She stammered.

&quot;Very much so.&quot; Kima stated with a nod, &quot;So much that just looking at 
your sleeping face made my heart pound. I wanted nothing more then to 
just hold you in my arms and protect you.&quot; 

Penny stared at Kima dumbfoundedly, &quot;Y... you w... watched me sleeping?&quot; 
She exclaimed aghast.

Kima raised her hand in protest, &quot;It&#39;s not what you think.&quot; She hastily 
explained, &quot;You passed out and we took you to the lobby to get help. I 
have been watching over you ever since.&quot; 

&quot;Why?&quot; 

&quot;Because... Because...&quot; Kima could not even understand her attraction to 
the girl or her need to protect her. In truth Kimberly was the caring 
one, the one who felt the passion of love and the longing. Kima simply 
held the sexual lust, or that was what she thought she was and what she 
had been told. Was it even possible for her to even feel love? She did 
not know, however when she set her eyes upon Penny&#39;s as they peering 
over her knees Kima could feel her heart ache in a way she had not felt 
in years, not since she first kissed Jenn. She rubbed her forehead as 
her thoughts rushed about, she always told Kimberly what to do when Kim 
knew better than herself how to deal with these emotions. Kima always 
acted like she knew everything when she was as lost as her other half. 
Right then she wished the twin were there to help her, no matter how 
much her double hated her Kima needed the girl at her side, she did not 
feel complete without her. 

&quot;Kimberly, where are you?&quot; She wrapped her arms around her head as she 
became overwhelmed by a sense of loss. She suddenly realized that she 
was without her other half and she did not know what to do with these 
feelings that were haunting her. Then she felt Penny&#39;s hand lightly set 
upon her knee.

&quot;Kim?&quot; Penny asked softly, Kima glanced up to see Penny staring at her 
with concern in her eyes, &quot;A...are you alright?&quot; The girl inquired. 

Kima smiled up at the girl, &quot;I will be.&quot; Kima stated softly, &quot;I just 
need a moment.&quot;

&quot;A.. alright...&quot; Penny removed her hand and Kima wished that the girl 
would return it.
Kima glanced around the basement; a small narrow window high off the 
ground, too small for even a child to crawl through, told her that it 
was night outside. She saw a set of stairs leading up and pointed to 
them, &quot;Where do those lead?&quot; She inquired curiously.

&quot;Upstairs.&quot; Penny replied. 

Kima got to her feet and brushed the dirt off her pyjama bottoms, &quot;Well 
that looks like the only way out.&quot; She started towards the stairs then 
turned to see Penny did not make a sign of moving, &quot;You coming?&quot;  

Penny shook her head, &quot;I...&quot; She became silent yet again and her eyes 
nervously flickered over the room.

Kima returned to the girl&#39;s side and knelt beside her, &quot;What is it? Is 
there something wrong?&quot; 

&quot;I...&quot; Penny lowered her head, &quot;I was searching for something...&quot; She 
rubbed her arms as she quickly glimpses around the room. Not like she 
was looking for something, it was more like she was afraid of something, 
something in the shadows. 

Kima held her hand out to the girl, &quot;Let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; She stated 
boldly. 

&quot;But we can&#39;t leave.&quot; Penny anxiously explained, &quot;We will be punished.&quot; 

&quot;I will not let anyone hurt you.&quot; She remarked soothingly, &quot;Maybe I can 
help you find what you lost?&quot; She beaconed for the girl to take her 
hand.

Penny watched the hand warily then gingerly placed her hand in Kima&#39;s 
and nodded. 

&quot;Good.&quot; Kima smiled at the girl, &quot;Now what are we looking for?&quot;
