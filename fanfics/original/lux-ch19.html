<P>Episode XIX: Come Together</P>
</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“So what’s your plan?” asked Jack as he leaned up against the balcony railing. He, Keiko, and Ichi had gathered for a private meeting “outside” (specifically, one of the artificially-created outdoors areas built into the foundation for people who hated being surrounded by stone and steel) to discuss their next step in the campaign. The entire crew might have unanimously elected Captain Lazarus to be their leader, but it seemed that Keiko had the plans in store.</P>
<P>&#9;“Well, as you are aware, Aisuna more or less lives in the frozen northern regions of Earth--specifically, its pole. Even I do not know her precise location, though it would not take us very long to search for a being with a power of that magnitude. I have just been recently made aware, via telepathy through my superiors in Neppon, that Aisuna has finally completed her duties. Now is the time for the forces of evil to strike.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I think I understand,” said Ichi. “Now that this Ice Djinn creature is no longer obligated to the person who freed her, she’s going back to where she came from. The man that gave me my powers is going to go after her now that she’s loose, isn’t he?”</P>
<P>&#9;“I would if I were him,” muttered Jack darkly. “But that’s just me thinking like a greedy person. Anyway, we should be able to beat him to it if we head out tomorrow. Everyone’s too tired to go out tonight, so we’ll have to rest. Kit’s almost done with your propulsion device, or whatever it was that was broken.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Thanks,” grinned the pale woman. “I owe you one, Jackie.”</P>
<P>&#9;“We will not have much time,” stated Keiko flatly, trying to keep on the subject. “We will have to move out as quickly as possible. I hope and pray that we beat our enemies there, or else we will all be in very grave danger.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I don’t see why,” shrugged Jack. “I mean, didn’t you say something about those people needing Ichi to help free Aisuna? If she’s here with us, how can he free her?”</P>
<P>&#9;“If history has taught me anything,” murmured Keiko in a very grim voice, “it has revealed that people will find a way. Impossibility is only a word to them, not a concept. Our foe will find it difficult to gain his wish, true, but he <I>will</I> find a way. Nevertheless, it will take them some time to free and find her, which gives us two advantages. Our plan, therefore, will be to fly to the northern pole with as much speed as possible, and either wait for our enemy or else destroy them before they can free the Djinn. We cannot afford to fail.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I guess I understand,” shrugged Ichi wearily. She had been drained for awhile now, and with the late hour, the discovery of where her powers came from, and the upcoming battle each weighing heavily on her, it didn’t give her a whole lot of time to rest. If Toby had been there, she would have…</P>
<I><P>&#9;But she’s <U>not</U> here,</I> stated Ichi to herself, <I>so I have to stand on my own two feet. Ironic, though… Even with these additional strengths at my disposal, I can still find room for weakness…</P>
</I><P>&#9;“You tired?” asked Jack, easily sensing her weariness. She nodded her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes. I should find some time to rest, or at least cool off. I’ll ask Gerrand, Xyphos, and Matthew to prepare the shuttles for tomorrow morning, and then I’ll be off to bed. Are you two staying up late?”</P>
<P>&#9;“I might have a nightcap or two first,” replied Jack with a nod. “You go ahead and rest, Ich. If you stay up too late, your skin will turn pale.” Ichi gave her friend a wry glare, managing to curl her mouth despite her dropping energy.</P>
<P>&#9;“Cute, cute. Well, see you in the morning.” She left them with a wave, and once she was gone, Jack and Keiko looked at each other, their eyes connecting. Few people could ever boast the strength or will to stare into the eyes of the Seventh (or any) Judgment, but Jack seemed to have no problem at all.</P>
<P>&#9;“It looks like you’re thinking what I’m thinking,” he said. She nodded her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“I will not doubt that ‘he’ will be there as well. How long has it really been since the three of us were in the same place together?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Either too long or not long enough, depending on how you look at it.” Keiko hummed softly and agreed, and finally let out a sigh. Even she could be weary, though she rarely showed it. At least she was enthusiastic about going on the mission, unlike a few others she had been through.</P>
<P>&#9;“Will there be conflict?” she asked. He quickly shook his head.</P>
<P>&#9;“No, I don’t think so. I saw him recently, and he said that he would spare me or something. He won’t harm you or I out of respect, but the others… especially Ichi…”</P>
<P>&#9;“All we can do is be prepared,” she told him quietly. She leaned forward and took him into a hug--not really one of love, but an embrace of strength and assurance. Since they both needed it, he returned the favor, and wished her goodnight without saying a word.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;“We sure have been through a lot.”</P>
<P>&#9;By that time, Kit Hiro was used to Eien making small-talk with her, and enjoyed speaking with the furry female as much as possible. The two of them were in the same room together, one of them making final adjustments to the Foundation’s device and the other leaning up against the wall, hugging her knees to her chest. Kit smiled and nodded her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes. We have.”</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s really kinda silly,” chuckled Eien, a sound Kit found irresistibly cute. “I mean… both you and I joined up with the Captain for the sole purpose of clearing out our debts, and yet here we are--not only good friends, but involved in all this mess over that Ice Djinn. I mean, it’s really weird once you think about it!”</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s very strange,” agreed Kit softly. She turned around and smiled at Eien, a young humanoid woman she genuinely saw as pretty, and very fun to be with. Kit now trusted Eien as much as she trusted her boss, though of course the two girls’ relationship was a little more intimate.</P>
<P>&#9;“Like what parts are strange?” Kit blushed.</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s just an observation, but have you noticed that most every single lady here is attracted to other women? I mean, Miss Yamanaka has a female lover, and Miss Ichi seems especially bonded with a girl named Toby. Miss Tornheart and Miss Blake are a couple, and I swear that Miss Honmisei and Miss Ptolemie are sweet to each other, even though Miss Honmisei never shows it in public.”</P>
<P>&#9;“So are you saying that the poor Captain is surrounded by lesbians?” giggled Eien. Kit smiled brightly and shook her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“No! I just think it’s strange! And… ahh… well… our relationship… Uhh… I mean…” Eien smiled sweetly as Kit fumbled for words, and tilted her head in a cute fashion that made her floppy ears fall to one side.</P>
<P>&#9;“Aww, you think that you and I are…?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Well, um, no--I mean, uh, maybe--Uh, I mean, uh, umm…” Poor Kit stammered and blushed furiously, stuttering to the point of dropping her tools. Eien chuckled and walked over to her friend, wrapping her furry arms around the grease-stained girl and resting her chin on her shoulder. Kit’s red face remained, but her tenseness faded and she became comfortable again. She even returned the embrace.</P>
<P>&#9;“I wouldn’t mind,” whispered Eien gently, tickling Kit’s ear. “You’re really a wonderful woman, Kitten. I’m lucky enough to have you as a friend, but… I mean… if you seriously wanna be my girlfriend or something…”</P>
<P>&#9;“But I’m not that kind of girl!” insisted Hiro with a whisper. Eien grinned.</P>
<P>&#9;“Neither am I. But I just can’t resist you, Kitten, and not just because you’re so damned cute. You’re really a sweet and kind person; very loving and caring, and a gentle soul that has so much love to give. Your spirit is like a little trickle of water which can make any thirsty person feel happy and cool all over, and you’re absolutely beautiful to boot. Plus, ya got some mad skillz, grrl!!” Both Kit and Eien laughed, and held each other even tighter. Kit released her friend for a brief moment to stare into her gentle eyes, and then she obeyed the overpowering urge to give Eien a warm kiss full of love.</P>
<P>&#9;Eien Kinu moaned so softly that it sounded like the coo of a dove as her mouth slowly rubbed up against Kit’s. She smiled, outwardly and inwardly, and pressed slowly and softly into the slightly smaller girl’s lips, feeling the love that seeped through the skin into her own body. Her arms hugged Kit closer, adoring the simple touch of the young girl: the feel of her stained mechanic’s suit, the fragility of her body, the way her blonde hair slipped through her fingers like sand…</P>
<P>&#9;They kissed, holding their mouths and bodies and hearts close together for awhile--so long, in fact, that the Foundation began to groan impatiently from the lack of attention it was getting. Both Kit and Eien released each other with a giggle, blushing and smiling and remembering that there was still a world out there.</P>
<P>&#9;“My, that was beautiful,” whispered Kit, torn between staring into Eien’s soul and fixing the foundation. She placed her finger on the humanoid’s mouth, tracing her smallish lips softly in a way that was amazingly erotic. Eien smiled like a dope, giving Kit more room to trace, and reluctantly indicated the impatient nearly-fixed machine.</P>
<P>&#9;“Uhhh… you had better fix that, Kitten…”</P>
<P>&#9;“I don’t wanna… let you go…” she whispered, resting her head on Eien’s shoulder. The humanoid cabbit nearly burst from joy and love, and slowly stroked Kit’s golden hair as her words of loving declaration still rang in her head. Carefully, she guided the petite lady towards the machine, rocking her softly in her arms.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ahh… we can do this later,” she whispered. “You’d better fix this first, seriously.” A pause.</P>
<P>&#9;“All right. I’ll try and hurry. Please be patient, Eien.”</P>
<P>&#9;“My dear, darling, sweet Kitten Hiro…” Eien smiled warmly and gave the girl several more kisses, each one on a random spot on her oil-stained face. “Precious Kitten, for you, I will wait forever.”</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Matthew Dark breathed out a sigh of relief as the very last shuttle was set for the north pole of Earth. He had no complaints about working behind the scenes and not having as much say in the situation as Captain Lazarus or the Seventh Judgment, since he was a bit of a recluse himself. The only person he really talked to at length was Silvara, and only--it seemed--because she liked his wings.</P>
<P>&#9;“That appears to be everything,” he said to himself as his job was completed. He turned around and nearly smacked into the winged girl the moment he turned. She had apparently thought it a good idea to sneak up on him, but everything backfired and she nearly lost her balance. Matthew quickly pulled her to safety and put her back on her feet, though.</P>
<P>&#9;“Whew, sorry! I just came by to see how you were doing!”</P>
<P>&#9;“Oh, well, as you can see, my work is concluded,” he indicated. “Now I shall be heading for my room, unless you need me for something.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Yeah, I wanna ask you more about your wings!” she exclaimed. Matthew sighed wearily and tried to smile at her, but he was slowly becoming tired of the constant interrogations. He had unwillingly shared more about himself and his wings than he wanted to, especially considering that Silvara had a nasty habit of arguing with everything that had a voice.</P>
<P>&#9;“Very well,” he relinquished, “what do you want to know?” Before he knew it, the winged girl had rushed around him and was gently yanking on both his black and white feathers.</P>
<P>&#9;“So are you really a bastard child? Cuz’ you said that your parents were an angel and a demon!”</P>
<P>&#9;“No, I did not say that,” he sighed wearily. “My father was a creature that <I>resembled</I> an angel, and my mother was one who resembled a devil. They were far from divine and damned beings, though, and technically, they shouldn’t have even been in good standing with each other. The species my parents belonged to normally hated each other.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah, so it was a case of star-crossed lovers, then!” she squealed, rubbing her hand against his white wing. Matthew shook his head.</P>
<P>&#9;“I suppose you could say that. My parents loved each other deeply. My mother was unusually kind for her race. There are many beautiful devils and many ugly angels in the world, but my parents were among the most attractive, or so I have heard. I suppose you could call me a bastard child, since they were forbidden to marry and thus bore me out of wedlock, but they stayed with each other all their lives.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Aww, that’s so romantic!” she squealed, then dashed forward to give him a hug, squishing his wings. “So like, were they killed for their love?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Good heavens, no!” he exclaimed, sounding hurt. “They are still alive! I speak to them at very regular intervals, because I love them both very much, even though I am one of the few. And please don’t ask how I came to be an efficient bounty hunter or a shape-shifter; I already told you both tales.”</P>
<P>&#9;“No you didn’t.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Your quarrelling tongue has no affect on me, Silvara,” sighed Matthew. “I know you secretly agree with me. Now, if you do not have anything else to say, I must get to bed. I figure I shall have to exert myself terribly tomorrow, and I shall need all the strength I can muster up. Good-night.” Matthew walked away from the fascinated young lady in silence, his black and white wings folded neatly on his back. Silvara smiled dreamily, admiring the gossamer down that the wings were built of, and fantasized about having a pair or two of her own.</P>
<P>&#9;“So you <I>do</I> have a crush on him!” shouted a voice from behind.</P>
<P>&#9;“No I don’t!!” she spat in return. Silvara didn’t need to turn around to know that it was her friend Miichi. The limber little lady had ways of sneaking around that amazed her. She turned anyway, seeing a woman who looked a little hurt. Silvara liked Miichi to an unusual degree (probably because the girl always agreed with her, whereas nobody else would), and didn’t want to see her friend downcast, so she asked what was wrong.</P>
<P>&#9;“Well… I mean… you and Matthew seem close.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Aww, it’s not what you think,” replied Silvara with a wave. “I mean, I adore his wings, but the guy himself’s a little bland. He doesn’t seem very exciting, though you gotta admit he’s really good-looking.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Y-yeah…” Miichi murmured uncomfortably, rubbing her bare arms and casting her eyes to the side shyly. She was obviously distressed about something, though Silvara couldn’t figure out what. She approached her friend with a smile and gave her a soft push to snap her out of her slump.</P>
<P>&#9;“Hey. What’s up. What, are you jealous? Don’t worry; like I said, I just like Matthew’s wings. I’m really not attracted to him at all, or even to men in general. You can have him if you want.”</P>
<P>&#9;“No… it’s not that…” murmured Miichi. She was doing a good job of hiding behind her glasses, but Silvara wouldn’t have it, and advanced further to pry out what she needed.</P>
<P>&#9;“Then what? Are you just uncomfortable? Is it the battle?” Miichi blushed again, unable to look into Silvara’s deceptively-innocent eyes. The curly-haired woman was indeed stunning, wings notwithstanding, and never bothered using restraint or bush-beating when she spoke. She was honest, perhaps annoying, but she spoke her mind and stuck to her own ideals and morals. She was a good woman, not without faults, and Miichi liked her, perhaps more than a friend.</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s… not that either,” she replied meekly. “It’s… well… I can’t tell you.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Do you have a crush on me?” she blurted, smiling. Miichi backed away in surprise and immediately shook her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“N-no, no! I… I’m not attracted to women like you are! I mean, I didn’t even know you were… Um… uh, really, it’s not like that at all!” Silvara chuckled, and placed her hand on Miichi’s small shoulder.</P>
<P>&#9;“Darn. And just when I was falling for you! Oh well, eh? See ya round’ Meesh!” The winged woman winked at her friend, and walked away as casually as ever, as if nothing had happened at all. Miichi Zuroi was left frozen in the hangar, mentally chewing on her friend’s parting words and wondering if there was any truth to it.</P>
<P>&#9;“Falling… for me…?” She shook it off, and slowly walked out of the hangar and towards her own room, but the recent events would stay with her all the night long.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Shellby Blake smiled as she hugged her girlfriend Lantariz from behind. The two women loved spending time together by themselves in silence, and were making a habit of it as the weeks rolled by and their relationship developed. Shellby absolutely adored Lantariz, regardless of her lineage, and saw the petite and introverted lass as an object of love and kindness, a voice of reason to balance out her random and aloof nature, and of course, an irresistible bundle of gorgeous beauty, an “utterly sexy woman” in her terms. Lantariz didn’t think so.</P>
<P>&#9;Although, she did return Shellby’s feelings. Shellby was kind of like a mother, a sister, and a friend all rolled into one talented and uncomplicated package, and even though there was a very faint resemblance to Galaga Starik in her, Shellby was the polar opposite in terms of the heart and mind. She was a mystery, though, but a sweet one.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah like this,” whispered Tara in her southern accent (the girl was spared heredity’s whims and resembled her father closest). “Just you’n me, sittin’ here, list’nin’ to each other’s breath and our pulses… Mah head resting against your chest, yer hands rubbin’ mah belly… mah fingers intertwinin’ with yours…”</P>
<P>&#9;“Stop it!” giggled Shellby, hugging Tara tighter. “You’re making me blush! Sometimes you can say the most erotic things, Tara!”</P>
<P>&#9;“Yeah, whenever ah open mah mouth,” she muttered playfully. Shellby chuckled and kissed her ear teasingly.</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s true. Oh, but I do enjoy this as well, Tara. It’s really sweet, just to hold your beautiful body in silence. You smell good.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Thanks, you too. Hey, Shellby?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Hmm?” Tara squirmed a little, and with the aide of her girlfriend, she revolved around until she was face-to-face with the taller woman. She put her arms around Shellby as well, and wrapped her legs around the woman’s waist. Her lips found their way to Shellby’s and kissed them once before opening in speech.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ah got some questions for you.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Damn, you are too sexy for your own good,” hissed Shellby, her face very serious. Tara smiled bitterly and kissed her again.</P>
<P>&#9;“Hush. Yer mind’s always in the gutter. Clean it out and lissen.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I’m all ears, chickadee,” promised Blake as she pressed her mouth to Tara’s. Lantariz smiled, sighed, and nestled her head in the crook of her girlfriend’s neck.</P>
<P>&#9;“Shellby… do you feel like we’re bein’ left behind in all this? Ah mean, it’s like you an’ me didn’t have any say in anything, and we’re just along for the ride. You and ah been through a lotta adventures together, but ah feel way outta mah league. It’s like… we’re in a race, but everyone else is runnin’ while we’re walkin’. Ah’m just afraid that ah’ll get left behind… and ah won’t know what the hell’s goin’ on until it’s too late.”</P>
<P>As always, Shellby knew just how to make Tara’s questions and fears go away, and gave her girlfriend a simple smile and a kiss before answering.</P>
<P>&#9;“Sweetheart, the best thing that you and I can do now is take pride in what we <I>can</I> do. We may not be strong or fast, or even that smart, but we have skills that nobody else does. Who else has even seen half as much of the galaxy as you have?”</P>
<P>&#9;“…Nobody.”</P>
<P>&#9;“That’s right. And does anybody know how to strum the guitar, or vaporize a creature, or make a certain redhead feel at home no matter where they go?”</P>
<P>&#9;“No,” chuckled Tara sadly. Shellby hugged her girlfriend tightly and rubbed her nose against the girl’s forehead.</P>
<P>&#9;“Then don’t worry. You just do what you do best, and you won’t get left behind. Besides, I don’t think either one of us could handle those responsibilities.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Mmm… Hey, wait a sec!” Tara jerked up and stared at Shellby in the eye, a question that had been nagging at her mind for days now finally coming to surface. “Speakin’ of which, how <I>did</I> you kill that monster, anyway? For all ah know, ah coulda just imagined that!”</P>
<P>&#9;“I was hoping I would avoid this,” replied Shellby with a defeated smile. She didn’t look sad or forlorn, just reluctant to speak. “Well, you’re a mature young woman, so you can probably handle what I’m about to tell you. I’m really not a pure human, Tara. I’m a genetically enhanced humanoid without any memories of my past. I really don’t know <I>who</I> I am, just… <I>what</I> I am.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Oh, is that all??” squealed Tara, as if she expected to hear something more dramatic. “Oh, well, that ain’t so bad! Ah thought you’d a been one’a them angels ah heard of, or some magic wizard! But shoot, a genetically advanced humanoid? Hell, that ain’t nothin’ special or shocking.”</P>
<P>&#9;“Really?” grinned the older girl. “So you’re not like totally blown away?” Tara shook her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“Naw, it kinda makes sense now that ah think about it. Ah always thought that somethin’ was weird about you, but now ah know. Aw, don’t worry; it ain’t like it’s a bad thing or anything. Hell, you’re still the prettiest and most talented woman ah’ve known!” Shellby smiled warmly, overjoyed that her girlfriend accepted who she was so readily, and dove forward to embrace her again. Their lips met several times and in very long, intimate intervals, until they were both breathless.</P>
<P>&#9;“I do believe I love you, Tara,” sighed Blake. Tornheart grinned.</P>
<P>&#9;“Really? Well, gosh! Ah’m flattered! But damn, ah’m also <I>tired</I>, too! Shelly, you wouldn’t mind if ah already went to bed, would you?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Only if I can join you,” she smiled. Lantariz nodded her head.</P>
<P>&#9;“Of course. But no sex.”</P>
<P>&#9;“<I>Damn it!!!</I>”</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;Asuka Honmisei was content to be alone as she looked up at the stars surrounding the Foundation, and the glowing blue planet beneath them. She rarely had time to really stop and admire the view, let alone allow her mind to freely think. She was usually busy with her missions, killing something here or destroying something there, and never appreciated what was around her. The encounters with Brinna had slowly changed her ways, though, and she found herself looking into mirrors and not recognizing the half-elf who stared back.</P>
<P>&#9;Oh sure, she was the same physically. She still had long reddish hair, green eyes, pointed ears, and a skin tone that wasn’t quite peach in color. Her body was lean and muscular, tough and hard without any soft spots, and her scowl was still as cold as ever. But… she had <I>changed</I> over the weeks--not necessarily an unwelcome change, though she hated of thinking of herself as “going soft”.</P>
<P>&#9;She knew that Brinna, and the revelations that her near-death had brought, were the cause of it all. The exotic dancer saw something within Asuka that the half-elf never suspected was there at all, a kind of purity and gentleness that had been dormant for years. Asuka put on a front of arrogance, strength, and belligerence, but Brinna seemed to see a softer, sweeter side to the elf. Of course, she openly admitted to having been attracted to other women for as long as she could remember, but Asuka was really the first one that actually seemed to <I>care</I> about the dancer.</P>
<P>&#9;That, and the fact that she had saved her life, separated her from so many other failed attempts at romance that Brinna had tried. Asuka treated her with an unusual amount of kindness, which was probably where Ptolemie got all her “fanciful” ideas from. Asuka normally scoffed at the romances that depicted people falling in love with their bodyguards, but now that it was happening to her, she didn’t know how to handle it.</P>
<P>&#9;She had been sweet with Brinna a few times, and had allowed her to snuggle up next to her every night since their joining. She was apprehensive about the dancer’s love: not because she feared being attracted to another woman, but because she did not know how to give or receive any kind of love at all. She had been a warrior all of her life in a very literal sense, and the only love she got was a faint semblance from some family members who had estranged themselves from her ages ago.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Asuka never would’ve admitted it, but sometimes, the love scared her.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&#9;As she stared up at the night sky and contemplated these things, she felt two warm arms fold softly over her body, hugging her stomach close. She could smell the soft lilac perfume and could feel the warmth of a smallish body pressing up against her, and knew it instantly to be Brinna. She could not hold back the smile, though it came out very sadly as she touched the woman’s hands.</P>
<P>&#9;“Yes?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Good evening, Sukie,” whispered the dancer, using her cutest pet name for the half-elf. Asuka’s smile grew a little happier as she scoffed.</P>
<P>&#9;“Hey, Brinna. You want something?”</P>
<P>&#9;“Just company,” sighed the woman as she rested her head on Asuka’s shoulders. Asuka’s smile faded, and she sighed heavily as the woman placed her trust and her heart on the half-elf’s broad shoulders. She had no idea what to do next, though inwardly, she really wanted to respond in a loving manner.</P>
<P>&#9;“Well… I can do that,” she answered. There was a silence after that, in which both women stared up at the stars and held onto each other, either by the stomach or by their hands. Asuka smiled softly, the first time in a very long while she had done so, as her fingers intertwined with Brinna’s. The touch was a thousand times more erotic than anything she could ever hope for; it was like a blast of electricity snaking through her entire nervous system, giving her unfelt pleasures.</P>
<P>&#9;“You’re so soft…” Asuka actually chuckled as Brinna’s warm breath tickled her neck, and she swatted at the dancer playfully.</P>
<P>&#9;“Stop it… that tickles…”</P>
<P>&#9;“So Sukie-poo is ticklish?” giggled Brinna. Asuka’s face turned red as her ribs were mercilessly attacked by Ptolemie’s fingers, and though she tried forcing her laughter down, it was too strong and burst through the dam with ease. Brinna joined in as well, and tickled her bodyguard until the woman was dizzy and nearly suffocating.</P>
<P>&#9;Still smiling brightly, Asuka turned around and looked into Brinna’s eyes, her breath calming and her flushed face slowly returning to normal. Brinna returned the smile with a look of pure awe and joy, and put her arms around her bodyguard as she stared into her gorgeous face.</P>
<P>&#9;“Oh, Asuka… if only you could see your face… it’s positively glowing!”</P>
<P>&#9;“Why are you so good to me?” smiled the half-elf warmly. Brinna grinned.</P>
<P>&#9;“Because! You’re so good to <I>me!</I> You’ve cared for me and cared about me for as long as we’ve known each other! You saved my life, and you’ve always been there for me when I needed you. Nobody else has ever done that before, Sukie, and that’s why you’re so special to me.”</P>
<P>&#9;“But why waste time with me?” wondered the half-elf. “I’m not nearly as pretty as the other women. All I can do is grunt and fight.”</P>
<P>&#9;“That’s utter nonsense,” whispered the dancer as she stroked Asuka’s cheek. “You’re a beautiful, gorgeous, irresistible woman, inwardly and outwardly. You act tough, but I know that you’re really just gentle and sweet on the inside.”</P>
<P>&#9;“No I’m not,” muttered Asuka, blushing a little. Brinna practically squealed at the sight.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ahh, you’re so <I><U>cute</I></U> when you blush!!!”</P>
<P>&#9;“I’m not!” blurted an embarrassed Asuka, her face turning even more red. Brinna laughed merrily, and gave the slightly-taller woman a loving hug. Asuka froze briefly, not sure how to respond, and simply mimicked her for the time.</P>
<P>&#9;“I’m so glad we met, Asuka,” whispered Ptolemie as she rocked in her bodyguard’s strong, gentle arms. “I’m really glad. All my previous girlfriends didn’t give a hoot in Hell for my well-being. Of course, I was stupid to think I ever loved those asses. I don’t understand why a wonderful woman like yourself ever puts up with a jackass like me.”</P>
<P>&#9;“I’m more of a jackass than you are,” replied Asuka with a semi-proud smile. “Or maybe just a bitch. I’m wondering how <I>you</I> can put up with me!”</P>
<P>&#9;“Because I know that you’re really a sweet woman on the inside!” whispered Brinna firmly, hugging Asuka close. She looked up, her gorgeous copper face glowing brightly with love and respect, nearly blinding Asuka. “And… I love you, Asuka. I can’t deny it; I love you and care for you deeply. I don’t know if you feel the same way, but… I had to tell you. I couldn’t keep it in any more. I’m absolutely head over heels in love with you, Asuka Honmisei.”</P>
<P>&#9;Asuka, frozen with amazement, could not respond--she only gawked. Brinna had poured her heart and soul out, presenting both fragile objects for Asuka to either crush or embrace as she saw fit. There was no way the half-elf could ever be so cruel as to crush the woman’s spirit, but… she was still afraid on the inside. Perhaps, deep down, she feared her own inadequacy, and was scared of giving Brinna an inexperienced form of love when she obviously deserved the very best. She would only deprive her of her natural right, but still…</P>
<P>&#9;“I… want to love you too, Brinna,” she whispered, holding the woman close as she openly showed her fear. “But…… I don’t know how…”</P>
<P>&#9;“It’s not rocket science, silly,” she smiled. Brinna looked back into Asuka’s confused and frightened face again, only seeing a beautiful angel with a heart of gold and a passionate love that yearned to be finally set free. It was untested but undoubtedly strong, and all it needed was a little push to be set in the right direction.</P>
<P>&#9;“Just… go for it,” she whispered, her almond-colored eyes begging. “You’ll do fine, trust me. I know you have a lot of love to give. Don’t worry about failing. I’ll help you if you need it.” Asuka, too stricken to say anything, merely smiled back at Brinna so warmly and fondly that it was almost as if it were another person there, and not the hardened genius of the battlefield who had slain thousands. Brinna sighed again, caressing Asuka’s glowing face.</P>
<P>&#9;“Ohh… I really wish you could see yourself, Sukie. You look absolutely stunning…” Asuka grinned, a very loving and genuine sign of affection, and quickly lunged forward, pressing her mouth into Brinna’s for a kiss that was ages overdue, in both their opinions.</P>
<P>&#9;Immediately, a surge of unknown but welcome emotions flooded into both women, their hearts and souls flaring up with the passion of a very pure love. Asuka put her arms around Brinna’s smallish body, holding the woman she desperately wanted to love as close as possible as she drank in the ambrosia of her mouth. Her lips tasted absolutely beautiful, like honey dripping on moist roses, and she moaned softly as a feeling of genuine love and bliss overcame her entire body. Brinna, on the other hand, was sent into heaven and beyond as the woman she truly, truly, truly did love finally returned the feelings--feeling she knew she had been harboring for a very long time. Asuka’s lips were slightly chapped and not cared for like Brinna’s, but their touch and taste was more beautiful than anything the dancer had known.</P>
<P>&#9;They broke the kiss after a very long time, but quickly dove into a second, and a third, and many more, each reveling the erotic touch of their mouths pressing against each others’, each one aching for more and more, each one opening the floodgates of their love for the other, until finally they released each other to catch their breath, nearly drowning in the deluge.</P>
<P>&#9;“Oh, wow!” whispered Brinna, her face flushed and glowing. “Asuka, that was the most beautiful thing I’ve ever experienced, ever! I… I knew… that you had it in you!” Asuka merely smiled warmly, too speechless and breathless to reply. She was simply happy with kissing Brinna, the woman she wanted to love so much, and obeyed her desires again and again that night, as they held each other and loved each other under the starry sky.</P>

<P>Closing comments: Consider your patience for shoujo-ai now officially rewarded. If that didn’t score a hundred on the sweetness/cuteness meter, then I don’t know what will. Kissing scenes were always a bit hard for me to write, and intimacy never goes as well as I plan it. I always think of something really sweet for the characters to say, but they always end up saying something sub-par. Oh well. If it’s still enjoyed, I did my job. Preview of next chapter: Less sweetness and more trouble as the evil Grady beats our heroes to Aisuna! Will Glavius stand by and watch his beloved be abused? Will Grady get his wish? And how fast can a Seventh Judgment butcher a madman? Stay tuned! </P></BODY>
