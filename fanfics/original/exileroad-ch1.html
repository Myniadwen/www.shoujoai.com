<h1>Exile's Road (part 1 of 18)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<pre>        The sound of thunder rumbled off in the distance as a man&#39;s 
voice muttered, &quot;Hope we don&#39;t get more rain.&quot;

        The woman chuckled to herself quietly, wiping the bar off with a 
damp rag. There was a storm coming, she could feel it in her bones. In 
theory Midori was just the bouncer of this city tavern, but on 
relatively slow nights like this she didn&#39;t mind pitching in wherever 
she could. The &#39;Drunken Bard&#39; was an older establishment down near the 
docks, occasionally home to a rougher sort of customer. So here she was.

        Midori adjusted her leather vest, the heavy black wool of the 
shirt beneath laying smoothly over her muscles. Beside the tall black 
haired woman a heavy oaken staff stood, her primary weapon in the 
regular bar fights that broke out here. It had been a brawl that had 
gotten the attention of the Master of the bar, an old ex-fighter much 
like herself, and he offered her the bouncer job in exchange for room 
and board.

        Moving away from the bar Midori stalked across the roughly built 
wooden floor, watching the drinkers at their tables around the room and 
sitting in the darker corners of the bar. A few working girls also 
lingered, but Midori let them be for now. Occasionally one such girl 
would start something between two men, but it was a rare thing and most 
of the time they weren&#39;t too much trouble.

        Over on a small stage the bard played, soft music lingering in 
the musty air. There was always a magician at the &#39;Drunken Bard&#39; by 
ancient tradition, one that the Bardic schools helped maintain by 
sending their delinquent students as punishment. &quot;Ho, Nat&#39;anel,&quot; Midori 
smiled.

        &quot;Nathaniel,&quot; he corrected her with a impish smile, &quot;oh outlander 
dog.&quot; Nathaniel was more delinquent than most, the redheaded young man 
having been down here more than a few times. They had developed a 
teasing relationship, being friends at a studied distance.

        &quot;This from the man who&#39;s never left the country,&quot; Midori shot 
back with a wry smile as she moved off. She was clearly an outlander 
here, her skin a paler shade than the people of this southern kingdom. 
It had been many years since she had been home but she was marked in her 
very skin and bones by her homeland.

        &quot;Hey Midori,&quot; the bartender smiled as she swung back to the bar. 
His gray hair was short, thinning at the top, but his arms still bulged 
with muscles. He leaned over, offering a smile as he said, &quot;Looking for 
something to do?&quot;

        &quot;A quiet night, Garrison,&quot; Midori agreed with a sigh, leaning 
her staff up beside her. She offered a smile, &quot;Shall I clear some tables 
or something?&quot;

        Garrison barked a laugh, &quot;Just having you here stops fights, 
Midori. You don&#39;t need to do much more than look menacing.&quot;

        Midori snickered softly. &quot;It&#39;s not like you haven&#39;t been in your 
share of brawls,&quot; she reminded him with a smile.

        In fact Garrison had joined in that first brawl that she had 
been in here, when a guard has mistaken a waitress for one of the 
working girls. The guard had been insulted when she turned him down and 
decided to force the issue. His buddies took exception to Midori 
intervening and Garrison pitched in to support her. A few wrecked tables 
later and he was offering her a job.

        Garrison turned away, pulling a beer from one of the good kegs 
against the wall. &quot;Here,&quot; he pushed it over to her, &quot;go sit down and 
take a break.&quot; He flashed a sudden smile and added, &quot;Lady Jane was 
asking about you again.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Midori kept her voice casual.

        Garrison snickered, &quot;You can pretend all you want, but I know 
that you&#39;re interested.&quot; He dropped his voice to a whisper, &quot;It&#39;s rare 
for a noblewoman to come to a dive like this, she must be looking for 
something. Or someone.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re just looking for some news, you old gossip,&quot; Midori 
smiled, moving down the bar a bit to have her drink.

        Lady Jane was something of a puzzle, honestly, and Midori didn&#39;t 
like puzzles much. The blonde had appeared at the bar a few weeks ago, 
accompanied by a young man who&#39;s stance clearly said he was a bodyguard. 
They had sat down at a corner table, ordered one of the most expensive 
drinks in the house, then left as quietly as they came leaving only the 
name Jane. She only seemed to appear on days that Midori was working, 
and she often felt the woman&#39;s eyes on her.

        The doors swung open and Midori looked up, her eyes narrowing 
slightly. &#39;Soldiers,&#39; she thought, finishing off her drink with a smooth 
draught. The men in chainmail armor, helms and royal insignia strode 
arrogantly towards the bar, made their orders and then moved right to a 
table that was occupied by one of the regulars.

        &quot;Move aside,&quot; the leader of the soldiers barked at the man.

        &quot;There&#39;s other tables,&quot; Midori called out to them, keeping her 
voice casually.

        The leader of the guards look up, brown hair falling into his 
eyes as he sneered, &quot;But we want this one, bitch!&quot;

        Midori throttled down a flash of anger, looking over to Garrison 
for a cue how to react. The master of the bar was clearly angry, but he 
was holding his tongue for now. &quot;There&#39;s no need for any 
unpleasantness,&quot; Midori kept her voice perfectly level even as she 
grabbed for her oaken staff, &quot;you can easily take another table, boys.&quot;

        The leader swayed a bit, one of the other two steadying him and 
Midori realized that he had already been drinking before coming into the 
bar and probably quite a lot. As were all his fellows, there was little 
hope of someone trying to bring the others into line. Midori pushed off 
from the bar, quickly striding towards the angry group.

        &quot;Move aside, drunkard,&quot; the solder grabbed at the frightened man 
sitting at the table. moving to toss him away by force. &quot;Oww!&quot; he 
yelped. the staff smacking down on the back of his hand, making him 
release the man who promptly scurried away.

        Midori felt the men&#39;s glares on her even as the other customers 
all scampered for cover as fast as they could. &quot;You&#39;re welcome to insult 
me,&quot; Midori said to the soldiers quite calmly, &quot;but manhandling the 
customers is a bit much.&quot;

        There was a hiss of steel as the leader drew his sword, &quot;We&#39;re 
Queen&#39;s guard, you&#39;ve got no right to tell us what to do....&quot;

        The two other armed men hesitated and Midori seized the moment, 
meeting the leader&#39;s downward sword stroke easily with her staff. He 
looked stunned as the oak stood up to his blade, then his shock shifted 
to a pained expression as she kneed him somewhere very delicate. With a 
squeak he dropped, Midori pulling the sword away as he went down.

        &quot;Next?&quot; Midori dropped her voice to a dangerous purr.

        &quot;Ahh!&quot; the man bellowed angrily, swinging with a bit more skill 
than his leader. Midori turned the strike aside rather than meet it head 
long, using the boy&#39;s own motion to create the opening she needed. Off 
balance she slammed the staff down onto his helmeted head, ringing the 
steel like a bell and sending him crashing to the ground.

        From behind her Midori heard the sound of breaking wood. She 
whirled around with staff ready, blinking in honest surprise as she saw 
the noblewoman holding what was left of one of one of the chairs. At her 
feet the third guard lay, the rest of the chair scattered around him.

        &quot;My apologies,&quot; Lady Jane dropped the chair pieces, her blonde 
hair falling around her delicate features, &quot;but he was trying to attack 
you from behind.&quot;

        &quot;My thanks,&quot; Midori blinked, receiving a graceful nod of the 
head as the blonde turned around and walked back to where her bodyguard 
sat. By the look on his face he was rather wrathful with his mistress 
and intended to let her know.

        &quot;Wonder how much trouble these three are going to be?&quot; Garrison 
asked, coming around from behind the bar and looking down at the three 
men.

        &quot;Dunno,&quot; Midori sighed, pushing her black hair back tiredly. She 
frowned, &quot;You think they&#39;re really Queen&#39;s guards?&quot;

        &quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Garrison shrugged, &quot;they&#39;ve been 
recruiting a lot since the King died and his sister took the throne.&quot;

        Midori made a face, &quot;Damn.&quot; She thought a moment, &quot;Better send a 
runner over to the barracks, let them know about this.&quot;

        &quot;Eh?&quot; Garrison looked at her in surprise.

        &quot;They&#39;re going to find out eventually,&quot; Midori shrugged 
slightly, &quot;better from our mouths than these three gutter trash.&quot; She 
studied the unconscious men for a moment, &quot;If they do try to make 
trouble over this, blame it on your outlander bouncer.&quot;

        &quot;If you are calling the guards,&quot; Lady Jane&#39;s refined voice had a 
bit of tension in it as she and her bodyguard made for the door, &quot;I must 
go.&quot;

        &#39;Isn&#39;t that interesting,&#39; Midori noted. Obviously the lady was 
slumming, and more importantly she didn&#39;t want anyone to know about it. 
She would have liked to think about it some more, but Nathaniel had made 
his way towards them.

        &quot;If they do cause trouble,&quot; Nathaniel was scowling at the 
soldiers, &quot;I&#39;ll gladly speak in your favor. The word of a bard is very 
good in court.&quot; He got a thoughtful look on his face, &quot;In fact, I think 
I feel inspired for a ballad.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Midori looked dangerous.

        &quot;The Ballad of Magnificent Midori,&quot; Nathaniel said grandly.

        &quot;Try it and die, bard,&quot; Midori growled out.

        Garrison chuckled softly. &quot;I&#39;ll send one of the dishwashers with 
the message to the guards,&quot; he said as he went to get the boy, &quot;but I 
won&#39;t be placing the blame on you.&quot;

        &quot;Man has no sense of self-preservation,&quot; Midori shook her head, 
&quot;these Queen&#39;s guards could make serious trouble for him if he doesn&#39;t 
sacrifice someone.&quot;

        &quot;He&#39;s loyal to his friends,&quot; Nathaniel said dryly, &quot;a quality I 
notice you two share.&quot; With that the bard went to collect his harp, 
wrapping it carefully before settling down to wait.

        The runner returned not long after with an officer and several 
of his soldiers in tow. Midori looked him over, realizing that this was 
a real combat soldier, not just a nobleman in uniform. More importantly 
he seemed to tag her as a fighter almost as soon as he entered that bar, 
meeting her measuring glance with one of his own.

        &quot;My name is Commander Hudson,&quot; the older man looked down at the 
three out cold soldiers then up with a piercing look, &quot;what happened 
here?&quot;

        &quot;These three tried to harm a customer,&quot; Midori said simply, &quot;and 
drew steel on me when I stopped them. I decided they&#39;d be better 
sleeping it off.&quot;

        Hudson&#39;s lips teased upward in a small smile, &quot;I see.&quot;

        Nathaniel stood nearby, shaking her head. &quot;The lady has no 
poetry in her soul, none at all,&quot; he sighed. With that he launched into 
a blow by blow account of the incident, also making Midori seem like 
some kind of great hero. He even rhymed it in parts like some old 
ballad.

        &#39;Hells, I hope that he wasn&#39;t serious about that damn ballad,&#39; 
Midori thought glumly.

        Hudson listened to Nathaniel attentively, his lips pulling up in 
a slight smile. When the boy finished he turned to Garrison and half 
bowed, &quot;I apologize to you, Master, and to your establishment. This 
shouldn&#39;t have happened.&quot;

        &quot;Aye, well,&quot; Garrison looked uncomfortable.

        &quot;And thank you,&quot; Hudson turned to Midori, his expression 
thoughtful, &quot;for not killing these fools. I suspect you could have, if 
needed.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t kill,&quot; Midori said firmly, &quot;not any more.&quot;

        &quot;Of course,&quot; Hudson nodded. He instructed his men to collect the 
unconscious soldiers and they left, the older man tossing Midori a final 
glance before he left.</pre>
