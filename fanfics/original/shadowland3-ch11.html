<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 11 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Jennifer rolled over in her bed and opened her eyes. Her mind still 
cluttered with thoughts from the passing day. With a deep sigh she 
rolled out of bed and sat upon her bed, holding onto the edge of the 
pillow, her eyes scanning the opposite side of the room where Kim used 
to sleep. She still could not get over the fact that Kim was no longer 
with them. The fact that Kim simply faded out of existence did not help 
matters, if there was a body or something to bide a farewell to then 
maybe she could let go, but as it stands there was nothing, not even a 
single strain of her hair. Jenn rubbed at her eyes as the thought of 
never being able to hold the girl again intruded her mind and she buried 
her face into the pillow, letting out a tired and pained wail.  

Abruptly a pain ripped through her stomach as she was again reminded 
that her period had just begun that very day. She quickly got up from 
the bed as she realized that she had not changed her tampon in a while 
and dug through a plastic bag of items that she had bought earlier that 
day and pulled out a plastic wrapped tampon, then swiftly ducked out of 
the room and headed for the nearest washroom, her thoughts occasionally 
bumping against each other. Why did love have to be so complex and 
confusing? Why did she have to loss someone she felt so dear for just as 
she was realizing she was in love? She wondered again if she was 
destined to be alone, to never be with anyone ever in her life. It had 
been less then a week since she learned that her mother was dead, along 
with one of her closest friends, May Young, now she is finding herself 
having to bury yet another friend and she was not sure she could handle 
much more. She scratched at her wrist as they twitched and glanced down 
at the newly healed scars that crossed them. She was starting to 
understand why she would try to kill herself, a fact that she only 
recently learned about as well. According to Kris someone had taken her 
memories of their love, the loss of her mother and a dear friend, along 
with her feelings of love, weighed so heavily on her heart and a small 
part of her wished that she had indeed died, then maybe she wouldn&#39;t 
have to face this suffering again and again. 

She turned a corner at the end of the hall and she spotted someone 
coming her way. At first she considered heading the opposite direction, 
in an attempt to dodge the person, when she noticed that it was Kima. 
The change in the girl&#39;s hair had confused Jenn at first, but even with 
her head hung low and arms wrapped around her waist Jenn could tell it 
was her friend. She watched for a moment as Kima staggered down the 
hall, leaning heavily against the wall and sliding along towards Jenn. 
There was something about Kima&#39;s halted movements that brought up a 
level of worry inside of Jenn&#39;s mind. The girl reminded her of herself 
back in school, lifeless and in such pain that she could barely force 
herself to move down the hall to class. This was not the confidence that 
she was used to seeing in Kima and that was unsettling to Jenn. 

&quot;A... are you alright?&quot; Jenn inquired softly, not wanting to startle the 
girl. 

The girl lifted her head and Jenn was shocked by the sadness that 
covered Kima&#39;s face, a mournfulness mixed with an intense amount of 
confusion. Jenn could almost see Kim in those eyes, the old Kim, the one 
that she longed to hold in her arms and protect from any kind of harm. 
Was it possible that Kim and Kima had merged together again? She was not 
sure she wanted that to be true. Kim and Kima were the same and yet at 
the same time they were so different. Kim was such a soft and shy girl 
and the very thought of the girl not being around any longer made Jenn&#39;s 
heart ache. Meanwhile Kima was blunt, upfront and sexual, and wasn&#39;t 
afraid to show it. It was the sexual nature of Kima that slightly 
frightened Jenn. However at that moment all her fears were replaced with 
a deepening amount of concern.

The moment Kim&#39;s eyes set upon Jenn she jumped back, it was as if she 
did not recognize Jennifer and was frightened by the appearance of the 
girl, &quot;N.. No... leave me alone...&quot; She cried out in alarm.

&quot;Kima...&quot; She stopped herself as she recalled that this girl preferred 
to go by a different name, &quot;Kimberly?!?&quot; Jenn quickly moved to the 
girl&#39;s side, &quot;What is wrong? Its me, Jennifer, remember?&quot; 

Kimberly shook her head, &quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; The moment Jenn&#39;s hand 
touched her shoulder Kim was hit by a new wave of images that struck 
with such force that Kim&#39;s knees buckled from under her and she dropped 
to the floor, taking Jenn with her. She clenched at the side of her head 
as memories invaded her mind, memories of playing with Jenn in a trailer 
park, kissing the girl in her bedroom and with those came the 
recollections of her father, the beatings, name calling and the sexual 
acts she was forced to perform. Another bout of nausea built up inside 
of her throat and she forced herself to swallow it back.  

Jenn pulled the girl into her arms, &quot;What do you mean? Can&#39;t you 
remember?&quot; She inquired worriedly, stroking the back of Kim&#39;s head to 
notice sometime wet and warm, she pulled her hand back to see it covered 
in blood, &quot;Oh my god! You are bleeding.&quot; 

&quot;M... my head... hurts...&quot; Kim stated through a stifled sobs, she 
clenched at her the sides of her head and softly wept as she curled up 
in a ball. 

Jenn lightly placed a hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder only to have her 
flinch away and glance up at Jenn, staring at Jenn in confusion, &quot;Don&#39;t 
you remember me?&quot; Jenn inquired anxiously. 

Kim&#39;s mouth trembled as she tried to form the words in her head. She 
reached out one shaky hand and lightly touched Jenn&#39;s cheek, swallowing 
hard she finally spoke, &quot;I... I remember... a kiss...&quot; Her last words 
came out in no more then a whisper and Jenn had to strain to hear her. 

Jennifer flushed at the words, &quot;You... you... remember that?&quot; 

Kim sadly shook her head, &quot;&#39;I wish I was the one that kissed you.&#39;&quot; She 
said softly. 

Jenn was even more surprised by these words for those were the other 
Kim&#39;s very last words before fading away, &quot;How could you remember that?&quot; 
She inquired nervously. 

Kimberly set her eyes upon Jenn, such heavy-hearted eyes that appeared 
much older then their seventeen years. Jenn could see both Kim and Kima 
looking back at her and she felt her heart ache. Kim wasn&#39;t dead after 
all; she was sitting right in front of her, whole again. Then she 
recalled Penny and the way Kimberly snuggled up to the girl and even 
asked to move in with the girl. She turned her eyes to her lap, unable 
to look the girl in the eyes any longer. 

&quot;Did...&quot; Jenn took a deep breath as she considered what she was about to 
ask. She needed to know the truth and after the past couple of days of 
lies she felt she deserved that much, &quot;Kimberly... did you sleep w... 
with Penny?&quot; 

Tears tumbled over Kim&#39;s cheek, &quot;yes...&quot; She said with a squeak as a 
wail emitted from her throat and she pitched over, clamping her arms 
around her stomach and she coughed and sputtered. 

Jenn wrapped her arms around the girl and pulled Kim into her arms, 
allowing the girl to cry into her shoulder. A multitude of thoughts 
moved through Jenn&#39;s mind as she silently held the girl. Part of her 
knew she could not blame Kim for her actions. She had seen part of what 
the girl had been through and knew far too well that Kimberly had been 
struggling with her sexual nature for a long time. Even when split in 
two part her shyer half still displayed intense sexual needs that Jenn 
had witnessed first hand that first night they shared the same bed. She 
had no idea what the girl went through when she entered Penny&#39;s dreams 
and was faced with Jessica and Penny&#39;s nightmares. From what Jessica 
told them it was not pleasant and Kim would have had to face the same. 

As her mind rolled over her thoughts she noticed something red on the 
girl&#39;s leg, &quot;Kim... did you cut your leg?&quot; She inquired fearfully. 

Kimberly pulled back from Jenn to look down at red blotch that had 
caught her friends attention, &quot;I... I don&#39;t think so...&quot; Carefully she 
stood and glanced down to find the crotch of pyjama bottoms and legs 
were coated in a thick layer of blood. She stared at Jenn with panic 
filled eyes. 

Jenn quickly got to her feet and steadied the girl, &quot;It&#39;s just your 
period.&quot; Jenn soothed the girl. &quot;There is nothing wrong.&quot; 

&quot;I... I...&quot; Kim stammered and she slowly shook her head. 

Jenn blinked at the girl, &quot;Haven&#39;t you had your period before?&quot; She 
inquired lightly. 

More tears filled her eyes, &quot;I can&#39;t remember.&quot; She stated through a 
veil of tears.
