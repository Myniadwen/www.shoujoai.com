11:47 am

            The thrill of independence was disturbingly temporary. A 
young woman seeking to break free from heavy familiar chains will be as 
a dove when she casts aside everything that has weighed her down, but 
flying so freely can be frightening, especially if she&#39;s spent just 
about every penny she owned for the sake of this liberty. She realizes, 
only too late, that cutting herself off from those suffocating people 
means she must now confront all those problems mother and father once 
fought--that housing, food, transportation, college fees, and other 
expenses are now her responsibility. And so, in a cruel twist of irony, 
throwing off one suit of chains only causes another to be thrown upon 
her shoulders. She hopes that, as she draws nearer to the bookstore, she 
will finally be relieved--and able, at long last, to experience life 
according to her own rules.

            &quot;They don&#39;t have a &#39;help wanted&#39; sign,&quot; she muttered to 
herself as she touched the door. She took a deep breath and pushed.

You complete my fate

The world unwinds inside of me

You complete my fate

The halo crawls away

You repeat my fate

Rewinding all we can

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Come and save me

You complete my fate

The heavens stroll inside of me

You repeat my fate

Revealing who we are

You refill my place

You refill my place

Come and save me

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Fill me up

Believe in me

Drink the wine

Take my hand

Let me follow

&quot;Inclusion&quot;

            The young woman, unemployed and desperate, was welcomed by 
an enchanting atmosphere. The world was lined with books, magazines, 
comics, graphic novels, accessories, various posters and maps; the aroma 
was a curtain of vanilla, cinnamon, cedar, and the musk of forgotten 
tomes; the music was quiet, reflective, and inspirational. She stood in 
the doorway, feeling lost but excited, her stomach knotting as thrills 
climbed down her spine into her belly, to shaking hands and knees, and 
each of the senses could indulge as it pleased, as if Parody were the 
perfect banquet.

Let what will be, will be; she takes it all in stride

Restrained by her antiquated family, she is a deviant

Escaping life through games, fantasy, and her close-knit friends

Thuy &quot;Terra&quot; Huynh Tu

            As Terra stepped into that world, she picked up scraps of 
conversation from the back. Since there didn&#39;t appear to be any 
employees prowling around--nor any customers, for that matter--she 
followed the noise while trying not to eavesdrop.

            &quot;...Weekends are where we...most...nine to five... 
Sundays...would really...a lot.&quot;

            &quot;That seems...suppose you&#39;d have...to fill in for...&quot;

            &quot;I&#39;ve been...tell you...make it into the team...change 
your...I can give you...&quot;

            &quot;I appreciate it.&quot; Terra finally found them and stood there 
patiently. One was a Romanesque beauty, with dark skin and hair; the 
other was distinctly American, fairer and less intimidating.

            &quot;Um, excuse me.&quot; She grinned timidly, wondering which lady 
to address. &quot;I was just, uh...wondering if you guys worked here.&quot;

            &quot;Si,&quot; the Italian woman answered. &quot;What can we do for you?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, I was wondering if you&#39;re hiring or not.&quot; Terra was 
nervous; she could be excused for her ineloquence. Their reaction was 
quite distinct: both women looked at each other, plainly astonished, and 
one even began to laugh quietly.

            &quot;Well how do you like that?&quot; she said. &quot;Is that good timing, 
or is that good timing? We were just discussing that,&quot; she said to 
Terra. &quot;Do you have time for an interview?&quot;

            &quot;Uh--really? Um, I mean...sure, yes, I definitely have time! 
Thank you!&quot; Terra&#39;s tension loosened all at once--all those chains 
stifling and restricting her now felt as slippery as buttered 
noodles--and she nearly floated to the manager&#39;s office.

            &quot;You came at a great time,&quot; said the older woman as she cast 
her head back. She had long, shimmering hair that rippled and waved like 
mahogany reflected in a lake, kept in tow with a pink hairband, her 
clothes simple but very sharp: a skirt, polo shirt, and high heels, with 
a green watch and several bracelets decorating her arms. She paused in 
front of her door, playing with the lock, and quickly extended her hand. 
&quot;I&#39;m Robin. It&#39;s a pretty relaxed atmosphere here, so don&#39;t feel like 
you have to call me by my last name.&quot;

            &quot;Uh, okay. I&#39;m Terra.&quot;

            &quot;Do you have a r&eacute;sum&eacute;, Terra?&quot; Robin said as she opened the 
door and led the younger woman inside. Perspiration freckled Terra&#39;s 
skin, but Robin&#39;s assuring smile put her at ease. &quot;It&#39;s no big deal. The 
job isn&#39;t difficult at all. It&#39;s a great entry-level position. Um, have 
you worked anywhere else?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, well, I&#39;ve been working on this online comic for 
awhile, if that counts. I also do some freelance programming on the 
side, but no...my parents really discourage me from working. Uh, but I 
really want the job, Miss...uh, Robin!&quot;

            &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t want to cause any conflict.&quot;

            &quot;No, you won&#39;t!&quot; she exclaimed hastily. &quot;I just recently 
moved out and I&#39;m on my own!&quot;

            &quot;Oh, okay. Well, if everything&#39;s all right, I guess I should 
ask if you have any questions.&quot;

            &quot;Uh, yeah. Could I ask what shifts are available? I&#39;m going 
to attend this local college soon...&quot;

            &quot;You mean Carnegie? Fausta&#39;s going there as well--she&#39;s the 
woman you saw with me. Uh, right, schedules.&quot; She plucked a calendar 
from the stack of papers on her small desk--Robin&#39;s office was very 
clean and organized, with several plants and a clock to give it 
ambiance--and skimmed it with a pencil until she arrived at her 
destination. &quot;Fausta&#39;s covering weekends, so if you could take the 
evening shift, that would really help out. I can handle most of the day 
shift myself; we don&#39;t get many people here once school&#39;s in session. 
Can you come in from four to ten?&quot; Terra pursed her lips in thought. Her 
last class let out at 3:45, so if she hurried...

            &quot;Yes, I think I can manage that. That&#39;s six hours, right?&quot;

            &quot;Right. Basically, you&#39;re here to close shop and conduct 
daily inventory, but you might have to stock shelves and work the 
register as well.&quot;

            &quot;I can do that, no problem!&quot; Both women smiled, and Robin 
gave her a waiver sheet and tax information--a surefire sign that 
Terra&#39;s troubles were at their end.

            &quot;Excellent! Just sign your life away and be here by 
tomorrow.&quot;

            &quot;Oh...&quot; Terra grimaced, &quot;that may not work out so well. I&#39;d 
like to try out for the soccer team.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, okay, no problem. That ends at 5:30, I believe, so you 
can just come in at six for a quick orientation. Wait, tell you what: 
why don&#39;t you write out your school and practice schedules, and I&#39;ll 
arrange it from there.&quot;

            &quot;All right.&quot; Terra was ready to burst from happiness; she 
couldn&#39;t contain her broad smile. Not only was she getting a job, but 
she&#39;d be able to go to school and play sports as well! While she was 
busy with paperwork, another customer came into the store and went 
straight for the office. Terra glanced to see who it was; she didn&#39;t 
recognize the short-haired woman with a Ninja Turtles T-shirt and black 
jeans, but Robin did.

            &quot;Forget something?&quot; she asked.

            &quot;Just wanted to remind you about our &#39;outing&#39; tonight!&quot; the 
other woman whispered. Robin rolled her eyes and snickered.

            &quot;That&#39;s a good one. Don&#39;t worry, I haven&#39;t forgotten. Now 
could you at least pretend to work? I&#39;m in the middle of an interview.&quot;

            &quot;Oh, sweet! One more for the party!&quot; She winked at Terra, 
giving her a thumbs-up before disappearing. Terra stared at Robin, 
perplexed.

            &quot;That was Gardenia, from the caf&eacute; next door. We&#39;re taking 
employees to a local nightclub later tonight, which...means you&#39;re 
invited, I guess.&quot;

            &quot;Oh! Well, uh, that&#39;s an unusual perk.&quot;

            &quot;Not really,&quot; Robin replied softly. &quot;Dee and I are always 
trying to do fun stuff with our employees. She&#39;s got a movie night every 
Saturday, I hold game tournaments, we both order catering sometimes...&quot; 
Terra turned pale with exaltation. Up until today, she believed the only 
benefits to a job were insurance and paid vacations; she never could&#39;ve 
imagined having a &quot;fun&quot; boss before. And to think, she had applied at 
just the right moment, when her services would be needed the most! It 
must&#39;ve been divine intervention.

            &quot;Sounds great!&quot; she managed to gasp. &quot;So, like, what kind of 
nightclub is this?&quot;

            &quot;Well, it&#39;s drug-free, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re wondering. 
It&#39;s...sort of girls-only, if you catch my drift. It&#39;s not like either 
of us are implying anything by taking our employees there; it&#39;s just for 
fun. We figured since school would be starting in a week, we may as well 
treat our workers to something nice. You don&#39;t have to come if it makes 
you uncomfortable.&quot;

            &quot;Can I check it out, though?&quot; she asked reluctantly. The 
phrase girls-only had a Sapphic connotation to it, and while Terra was 
not completely unversed in that aspect, she was not what you could call 
a practitioner.

            &quot;Sure! You can carpool with me and Fausta. I&#39;m not really 
into that sort of thing either, so if you change your mind, I can just 
take you home.&quot;

            &quot;Okay, that sounds good. What time are you leaving?&quot;

            &quot;Seven-ish.&quot; Terra wrote it down. Not even an hour had 
passed since she set foot inside the bookstore.

            &quot;Then I will be there.&quot;

            &quot;Great, I&#39;ll see you later!&quot;

            &quot;Bye, and thanks!!&quot; She cast a giddy smile and soared out of 
the room, high on elation.

--Lauren Ofdensen, 22, Psychology major, no position--

            The owner of the Out and About lesbian nightclub, a 
dark-skinned vamp named Odessa, had been expecting the arrival of her 
competitors and friends for hours, so she made sure her place was 
suitable to their liking. Since it was still relatively early in the 
evening, the place was not quite up to its normal standards, but no 
doubt that would change soon. She immediately recognized the Flower and 
the Bird as they got out of their cars--she had a big crush on both of 
them and had once tried to seduce them--but the others were relatively 
new. Odessa put on her best smile as she approached the group, waving 
frantically amidst the sea of lustful women.

            &quot;Hi!&quot; she said, shouting over the loud music. &quot;Decided to 
invite the whole gang?&quot;

            &quot;They&#39;ve been working really hard,&quot; Gardenia replied. &quot;I 
figured I could treat them to a group night out. Some of them have 
school in a week, so this might be the last time they can stay out so 
late!&quot;

            &quot;Very nice of you!&quot; Odessa grinned sexily and traced her 
finger over Gardenia&#39;s face; Kemper just rolled her eyes and excused 
herself to go dance with her employees. Robin, in the meanwhile, stood 
off to the side. Loud, sexy, wild parties weren&#39;t her style, and 
Gardenia respected this; there was no way she was staying home tonight, 
was all, since she had promised to take Fausta and Terra.  Odessa 
sauntered over to her, hips swaying and shoulders rocking, and started 
to playfully rub up against her. Robin turned red and laughed; she 
decided to take the older woman up on her offer, since her accomplice 
was occupied elsewhere. Everyone was now left to their own devices.

            &quot;I am being glad you could come!&quot; Nadia shouted. Felicity 
was smiling meekly, flush with humiliation as she realized the mess she 
was in. Her father would most certainly disapprove of this with all his 
anger. Not only was she neglecting her academic and physical studies, 
but she was &quot;wasting her time&quot; going to parties, hanging out with 
half-drunk nymphomaniacs, and associating with lesbians on top of 
everything else! She was terrified of what would happen if he ever found 
out--but the thrill of defying him so completely was giving her a rush, 
and in all honesty, she had wanted to be in a place like this for as 
long as she could remember. There was much ambivalence at work.

            &quot;I think I&#39;m glad I came too!&quot; she shouted back. Nadia 
grinned, and instead of trying to speak with her (the floor and walls 
were vibrating with hot music), the Russian firecracker giggled and 
gently gripped Felicity&#39;s arms, dragging her onto the floor so they 
could dance. Velur was still a little conflicted and shy, but a large 
part of her wanted to throw every caution to the wind, and make merry in 
true Epicurean fashion.

            &quot;It&#39;s about time she loosened up!&quot; Gardenia yelled as she 
glanced over. Lau shot the dancing duo a look, and smiled at her manager 
and friend.

            &quot;I wonder what made her change her mind. Felicity&#39;s normally 
so reserved.&quot;

            &quot;Who knows what&#39;s going on inside that girl&#39;s head?! But if 
anyone can get her to relax, it&#39;s Nadia!&quot; Lau nodded, and for the sake 
of the moment, swayed her hips and politely flirted with the older 
woman. As the two moved around, trying not to crash into anybody, Lau 
noticed something odd and pointed her finger.

            &quot;Robin has a new employee. Did you see her come in?&quot;

            &quot;Nah, I was too busy trying to keep Odessa&#39;s hands away from 
my ass. Which one is she?&quot;

            &quot;That one, the Vietnamese girl.&quot; Gardenia turned around and 
saw a young woman with an average figure, her hair rich and dark as tar, 
several strands dyed red. There was a noticeable scar on her left 
forearm, and she wore an Escaflowne T-shirt and a skirt-dress. She 
certainly looked Asian, though Kemper couldn&#39;t figure out how Lau could 
tell the difference.

            &quot;Oh yeah, I see her. She&#39;s pretty cute.&quot; Terra was trying to 
get into the scene, but it just wasn&#39;t working out. Her idea of a good 
time was squatting down in front of a TV, playing classic RPGs and 
watching anime. However, she was also open to new experiences, as 
strange or frightening as they may be. Being in that room full of women, 
staring at them as they grinded, swayed, teased, toyed, and rubbed 
against each other, was something she never would&#39;ve been able to see on 
her own. There was some fun to be had here, in small doses--but like 
Felicity and Robin, it just wasn&#39;t that appealing to her, and after 
about three hours of dancing and awkward attempts at socializing, she 
found Robin and asked to be taken home.

            &quot;Uh, I know this sounds awful,&quot; Granveldt murmured, &quot;but I 
actually think I&#39;ll stay awhile longer. Hold on--I think one of Dee&#39;s 
people is ready to leave, too. You can ride with her. Felicity!&quot; Robin 
waved an exhausted, slender brunette over, and briefly made 
introductions. &quot;Felicity, this is Terra. She&#39;s ready to go home, but she 
needs a ride. Do you think you could take her for me, please?&quot;

            &quot;Uh, sure, that&#39;d be fine. Hi.&quot; The two women shook hands, 
starting a relationship that would carry on throughout their entire 
college lives, though they were unaware of it at the time. Felicity also 
introduced Terra to a Russian woman named Nadia, who greeted her 
affectionately. Nadia wanted to stay behind, but she wanted to be with 
Felicity more, so she agreed to carpool with them. Terra waved farewell 
to Robin (noticing Fausta taking a breather in the corner), and stepped 
back outside, into a much cooler and quieter atmosphere. Along the way 
home, Terra discovered that they all shared a single dream: they each 
wanted to play for Carnegie&#39;s new team. Perfect strangers turned into 
unexpected friends thanks to this ideal, and they each wished each other 
good luck as they got out of the car and headed for home.

--Terra Tu, 19, Applied Computer Science Major, no position--

            Soon enough, the morning of Wednesday, August 1st finally 
came, catalyzing the fates of many young men and women. It was a great 
day to try out for soccer: breezy, bright, not too warm, and full of 
energy. Leena and Kathlyn arrived just as Mr. Warren and the men&#39;s coach 
were wrapping things up, so they went over for a brief chat. The turnout 
had been less than the men expected, but they were still enthusiastic; 
it was only the first day. Out of the dozen or so that actually showed 
up, Warren spotted three men of exceptional skill, and Coach Bracton saw 
four.

            &quot;I know we shouldn&#39;t be picky at this point,&quot; Arthur 
grumbled, &quot;but I&#39;d like to recruit people that will at least give us a 
fighting chance. In spite of all our efforts, this is all we have to 
show. Well, it&#39;s better than nothing. See you tomorrow, ladies!&quot;

            &quot;And you. Katt.&quot; Leena gestured for her wife and began 
preparing for her own evaluations; Kathlyn brought out towels and water 
bottles. Shortly after they got settled in, a handful of women began 
trickling onto the field, some bashful and uncertain, others confident 
and excited. Because they had opted to go to bed early, Felicity and 
Nadia were completely rested and ready for action; they were among the 
first to arrive. Nadia&#39;s babushka (her grandmother) had called earlier 
that morning to offer her prayers and support; Felicity&#39;s father also 
made a call, but his voice was cold and hard-he expected her to 
distinguish herself from the others, and would not tolerate anything 
less than perfection. Nadia&#39;s cheerfulness really helped the stress go 
away, and Felicity offered a watery smile as she began her warm-ups.

            Terra Tu followed, a big smile on her face, eager to show 
her stuff. She was not strictly a soccer player, but her martial arts 
abilities would make up for that inexperience. Fausta came later, waving 
casually to her new coworker as she stifled a yawn. She had stayed up 
far too late and had spent too much energy partying; her wrath was 
focused inwardly. Lauren Ofdensen also strolled in, casual and 
indifferent, her hands in her pockets and an easygoing smile hanging on 
her face. Elisa Berkeley was one of the last to show up, since she had 
been debating this decision up until the last minute. Even now, she was 
unsure about the path she was taking, yet here she was, being welcomed 
by friends and strangers alike.

            Everyone had her own expectations for the try-outs, 
particularly in the woman who would be coaching and leading them. The 
general consensus had been that she would be an ugly, old, overweight, 
dull-eyed dyke with little fashion sense and even less passion, coughing 
and grumbling her way through a paycheck. What greeted them instead was 
something like a beautiful garden, lush and vibrant with wonderfully 
colored flowers, where animals could explore freely without fear, where 
the song of water and the sigh of the wind put even the most timorous 
hearts at ease. Coach Parkin-Katajisto-one learned to address her as 
&quot;Leena&quot;-was actually very cute for a fully-grown woman, her face bright 
and cheerful, eyes dancing with affection and zeal, hair soft and 
golden, wrapped in an adorable little tail. She looked more like a 
graceful ballerina than a muscle-bound sadist, and had a delicious 
Finnish accent. When she spoke or looked at the women lined up before 
her, one got the impression she honestly loved her job and cared about 
those under her tutelage.

            After introducing herself, Leena brought a younger, shorter 
woman named Kathyn in front of the applicants, stating that she was a 
part-time member of the staff. Kathlyn had a slightly edgier 
appearance-her hair was wilder and she had the glint of one who had 
experienced great hardship in her eyes-but she was just as happy and 
energetic as her partner (they didn&#39;t reveal their marriage to the 
others). After everyone signed in and claimed a water bottle, they each 
showed Leena a little of what they were capable of.

            Only half the women there had any actual soccer experience; 
it was noticeable even to Kathlyn&#39;s eyes. In fact, Fausta was so 
perfectly focused on her performance that she tuned everything out-she 
was blind, deaf, and dumb to the world, and it honed her into an 
aggressive athlete, a woman out to prove herself with the strength and 
willpower to back it up. Meanwhile, Nadia was a natural; her father had 
been on the Russian Olympic team, and she seemed to inherit his skills. 
She had been playing soccer since she was four; at twelve, she began to 
seriously compete, developing a calm, strategic mind and exceptional 
stamina. She had great potential to be a leader or even Captain, but 
crumbled under pressure. Finally, Felicity&#39;s whole world literally 
revolved around the sport, and it showed in her performance: she was 
just a shoe endorsement short of being a professional. Even Leena was 
amazed at how intimately and flawlessly she handled the ball, but she 
also noticed something dragging Felicity down-a dark ghost nagging on 
her shoulders, a fear of failure, an insurmountable pressure that was as 
closely ingrained in her psyche as her own personality.

            Lauren, Elisa, and Terra were different matters, and at 
first, Leena considered keeping them out. Rosewood&#39;s proposal called for 
the best and brightest available, and these three were novices. But 
something about their amateurish style attracted Leena&#39;s attention, and 
she gave them a closer examination. Terra Tu clearly had no idea what 
she was doing, but the woman was in excellent physical condition, thanks 
to years of martial arts training. Her passes, blocking, and running 
were average at best, but she had excellent kicks and flexibility, and 
discipline to match. Lauren Ofdensen, on the other hand, was awkward on 
the field, wildly thrusting her legs out and slapping the ball 
erratically, and she kept using her hands to block it-but she was able 
to catch the ball every time it came in her direction. Leena remembered 
Rosewood telling her of Ofdensen&#39;s baseball prowess, and she put the 
woman&#39;s name on her list for future evaluation.

            Elisa Berkeley proved to be a refreshing surprise. She was a 
meek, self-effacing, soft-spoken lady, more liable to pick up a violin 
than a soccer ball, always chuckling sadly when mentioning her skill. 
She certainly didn&#39;t compare to Velur, Khovansky, or Nazario, but she 
had plenty of unexpected moves and had solid defense. Leena saw a great 
deal of potential in her steady footwork and fluid movement, and wrote 
in her notes that this was another person to watch for. A few of the 
other participants caught her eye as well, for one reason or another, 
but she put them to the side, feeling they wouldn&#39;t be able to give 
Carnegie the jump-start it needed.

            &quot;All right, that&#39;ll be it for today,&quot; she announced. 
&quot;Everyone take a breather. You did well. I&#39;ve made some decisions based 
on what I saw today, so when I call your name, I&#39;ll tell you what I 
thought. Nazario-you&#39;re in.&quot;

            &quot;Good show, Nazario!&quot; shouted Elisa. Fausta slowly woke out 
of her delirium and grinned at the older woman. She had been so focused 
that she didn&#39;t even realize she had made the team.

            &quot;Thanks. You look like you&#39;re having fun,&quot; she said to 
Berkeley. &quot;I&#39;m glad you decided to come out here. Now I don&#39;t feel quite 
so excluded.&quot;

            &quot;Well then, it seems my decision had some merit to it after 
all!&quot; Elisa answered.

            &quot;So you weren&#39;t even going to try?&quot; Leena wondered.

            &quot;I know I said I wouldn&#39;t,&quot; Elisa muttered, &quot;but something 
inside of me just pushed me in this direction. In all likelihood, I&#39;ll 
end up warming benches and fetching water bottles for our more skilled 
players...I mean, if you even want me on the team. I want you to know, 
Miss Leena, I&#39;m not really here to win any games or prove any points. 
I&#39;d just like to put some exercise in my life and meet other people. I 
need the, uh, interaction. I wasn&#39;t completely awful, was I?&quot;

            &quot;No, you did fine,&quot; she replied warmly. Elisa Berkeley 
almost fainted as she saw the coach put a check mark next to her name, 
indicating that, through some bizarre twist of fate or extraterrestrial 
miracle, she had made the team. Elisa stumble to the bleachers, giddy 
with joy, too stunned to even stand up. Fausta smiled warmly and helped 
steady her friend, and sat back as she wondered who else would be 
included. She carefully studied her potential teammates for their 
strength, stamina, and ability, wondering who could be a worthy rival 
and who would just get in her way. There were at least two other players 
there who could probably fill that role, but the others...

            &quot;Ofdensen,&quot; the coach called, drawing Fausta&#39;s stare. Leena 
was looking over at a scrappy-looking woman who apparently still thought 
the &quot;punk&quot; look was cool. She gave her a smile and a thumbs-up, sealing 
her fate--to Fausta&#39;s surprise

            &quot;Her? She&#39;s not much better than you, Berkeley. I can&#39;t help 
but wonder what that woman is thinking. Say, are you even listening to 
me?&quot;

            &quot;What?&quot; she murmured emptily. &quot;Was I what? What were you 
saying? Nnh...sorry, Fausta, I&#39;m still a little stunned.&quot;

            Sigh. &quot;Talking to myself, am I? Then I guess it&#39;s pointless 
to ask who else you think the coach is accepting.&quot;

            &quot;Velur,&quot; Leena resumed, answering Fausta&#39;s question, &quot;very 
impressive. There&#39;s some things I&#39;d like to go over with you later, but 
on the whole, top-notch work.&quot;

            &quot;I knew you would win!&quot; Nadia squealed. Felicity just smiled 
wearily.

            &quot;And Khovansky,&quot; Leena added, &quot;you did great. I got the 
feeling you were holding back a lot, though, but you&#39;re definitely 
Carnegie material.&quot;

            &quot;Wahoo,&quot; she grinned. &quot;I like sound of those words. See, 
kitty cats, we will be in same job and team! That will be making us 
friendz, da?&quot; Felicity just shrugged indifferently. Leena dismissed more 
woman than she accepted, unfortunately, but she was looking for 
something outstanding, something that could make people discern her team 
from all the others. Call it talent, skill, strength, willpower, or 
potential; this was the extraordinary &quot;it&quot; factor that made people 
special. Terra was actually afraid that she would be included amongst 
the rejected, but to her delight and surprise, Leena addressed her with 
approval, stating that she could be a great asset to the team.

            One day has yielded six players, the cornerstones of the 
game. An enthusiast like Kathlyn would say that by the end of six days, 
Carnegie would easily have a sufficient lineup ready, but Leena was a 
bit more practical, and she was concerned that the day&#39;s meager turnout 
was an omen of troubles to come.
