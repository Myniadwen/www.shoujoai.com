Thanatos

Rin hated tearing Hsu Kai Lin apart from the only other friend she had 
in the world, but the Ronin needed to get going and Marissa had a 
different obligation in life. Kailin promised to keep an eye out for 
Marissa&#39;s friend Kagemusha, and the mysterious entity known only as 
Pale, though she doubted she&#39;d ever see any of them. Rin wanted to get a 
few seconds alone with Snowblood, to grill her about why she had to kill 
Rin and why she hated the idea, but the blind lady was long gone by 
then. Rin blamed Kailin for taking so much time with Marissa, but eased 
off once she realized One, how long it had been since the two had seen 
each other; Two, the conditions of their first meeting; and Three, how 
both girls seemed to be lacking in friends.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Rin said as she and her partner distanced themselves from 
the arena. &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be so pushy. It&#39;s hard for me to understand 
since I&#39;ve been indifferent about having friends, and you&#39;re so much 
younger than me.&quot;

&quot;Only four years,&quot; Kailin told her. &quot;We may be on opposite ends of the 
teenage spectrum, but it&#39;s not like you&#39;re old enough to be my mother. 
We could pass as cousins.&quot;

&quot;With our exotic names, it&#39;s not impossible, Hsu Kai Lin.&quot;

&quot;Though I do not think we are honestly related, Rin Takamatsu.&quot; They 
shared a smile and a nod; BaoBao yawned. Kailin instantly cheered up and 
tickled her &quot;other&quot; partner. &quot;Oh, is Captain Cuddles bored? Well take it 
like a woman, Caps. You had enough excitement at the tournament to last 
you a long time.&quot;

&quot;I still don&#39;t see how you could&#39;ve lost against Pandora,&quot; grumbled Rin. 
Hsu scoffed.

&quot;Gimme a break! You saw her against the others; she totally dominated 
the fights. Even you&#39;d have a challenge.&quot;

&quot;Not likely,&quot; she said, smirking. &quot;But, who knows? Now I would&#39;ve liked 
to have seen Snowblood fight her for real! Yeah! Then maybe I could get 
a grasp of her powers.&quot;

&quot;Whose?&quot;

&quot;Both. I can&#39;t help but wonder if I&#39;ll ever figure that strange woman 
out.&quot;

&quot;I think she likes you.&quot;

&quot;Ew. She&#39;s so weird.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re uptight. You need somebody liking you, even if they are 
going to kill you. I&#39;m far too young, but even if I weren&#39;t, you still 
wouldn&#39;t be my type. I will only love somebody who Captain Cuddles can 
befriend, and she doesn&#39;t like you!&quot;

&quot;From the mouths of babes...&quot;

&quot;I told you I&#39;m only four years younger!!&quot; Kailin pounced on Rin and 
wrestled her to the ground, but she was clearly outmatched: Rin was far 
stronger and more experienced, and took the fight as a jest, laughing 
and tumbling. BaoBao shrieked away, scampering on all fours to evade a 
flattening. The contest ended with Rin on top; she pinched Kailin&#39;s 
cheeks gently and gave a merry smile before helping her friend up.

&quot;So,&quot; she coughed, &quot;where to next, Miss Ronin?&quot;

&quot;I dunno. Wherever you want to go, Miss Inferno.&quot;

&quot;Hmm...the beach?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s as good a place as any, though I don&#39;t think pandas are allowed.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;ll go to one that&#39;s empty.&quot;

&quot;Great!&quot; exclaimed Rin. &quot;I actually know a spot! Hop on!&quot; Kailin jumped 
on and rode piggyback, as she sometimes did when Rin&#39;s bike wasn&#39;t 
around, and held on tight, BaoBao in her sling, as the older, faster 
girl sprinted away from the arena, across a vast countryside (wishing 
she had taken her bike after all), and finally towards a quiet shore 
with not a soul around. There they stopped, close enough to hear the 
waves crash and the gulls cry, yet not so close to see the eternal sand. 
They both took a deep breath of sea air, removed their shoes, and walked 
barefoot across the warm, white afternoon sand to the water.

They soon discovered they were not alone after all.

Rin noticed their company first; she came to a stop and stared, 
wide-eyed and wide-mouthed. Some distance away, perhaps ten meters, was 
a tall woman with short black hair, standing perfectly still as the 
waves tickled her toes. Her back was to them; she was not quite staring 
at the ocean so much as she was staring, oddly, at her hands. The 
strange thing was, though, that she was completely nude, from head to 
toe. Rin didn&#39;t even think she was real until she came closer and saw 
her idly flexing her fingers in and out, making quiet fists.

&quot;Who is that?&quot; whispered Kailin. Rin swallowed.

&quot;I dunno, but I have a bad feeling about this.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Carefully they took a few more steps towards the naked woman, 
studying her. Her skin was fair, her body plainly fit and muscular, her 
face set at an angle so they could just glimpse her profile. The eyes 
she had were fixed and dull, staring endlessly at her opening and 
closing palms, as if the mysteries of the universe were in her hands. 
She didn&#39;t seem aware of the company or the ocean or even her nudity, 
just her hands. Rin and Kailin stepped closer, until they could speak 
and be heard by the lady.

&quot;Uh...excuse me? I hate to interrupt&#151;you&#39;re plainly meditating, and 
that&#39;s cool&#151;and I mean, what better place than this beach, which is so 
private that you can stand here for hours in the buff, which you&#39;re 
obviously doing&#151;but, uh...well, gee, I don&#39;t mean to sound nosy, but who 
are you? Are you...really meditating?&quot; She tilted her head, trying to 
look full into the face of the tall woman. Kailin whimpered.

&quot;Rin...we should go. We should leave her alone.&quot;

&quot;I think I agree,&quot; she whispered softly. &quot;But I still...&quot; BaoBao yelped. 
The woman blinked. She squeezed her hands shut. Neither of the two girls 
knew that, eighteen minutes ago, she had been &quot;born&quot;, and had stood 
there since.

The very first act of this newborn woman was to whirl around, extend her 
arm, ignite her weapon, and cleanly slice off the heads of her visitors.

And then, as if still shocked over her own existence, she went right 
back to studying her hands again, taking her first deep breath. BaoBao 
yelped in the distance, and scampered away as the bodies of her comrades 
fell to the sandy floor...

.........

Two hours passed.

The woman took her first step as an entity in the world, and remarked 
how well her feet left impressions in the sand. She ignored the lifeless 
bodies and left the beach, naked and silent. She passed the infinite 
graveyard of space that separated civilization and the shores, doing 
nothing but walking as the days wore on. She did not grow tired. She did 
not become hungry, or thirsty. She did not sleep. She merely walked, one 
bare foot in front of the other, her deep black hair waving around her 
head like a devilish halo. She didn&#39;t even know where she was going; she 
just went.

She finally stopped at the very outskirts of a rusting town. A diner had 
been erected there long ago; its age had started to show a decade ago, 
and the half-hearted rejuvenation it received months earlier did little 
to improve its gruesome appearance. Still. It was something. It was 
really the first thing she had seen since leaving the beach, so it 
interested her. So, without any clothes on yet, she walked inside the 
diner aimlessly. Above all else, she believed, civility required a 
covering for her extremities; otherwise, nothing could be done.

Activity ground to a natural halt as she stepped inside, naked like the 
newborn she was, quiet as the wind, her eyes empty and dark as caves. 
Men gawked, their forks hanging in midair, some food still balanced on 
them. Women gasped, some trying to cover their children&#39;s eyes. A few 
people whistled and gave catcalls. The proprietor of the diner cleared 
his throat, stepped in front of her, and crossed his arms.

&quot;We can&#39;t let you in here, ma&#39;am,&quot; he drawled. &quot;You&#39;re gonna have to 
leave, or else I&#39;ll call the cops on you.&quot; She studied him, as one could 
study a caterpillar they would soon step on, and brushed him aside. She 
continued, oblivious, searching for something, for something, what? 
Clothes. Women&#39;s clothes. Of course. She was a woman, so naturally...

&quot;I don&#39;t think you heard me,&quot; stated the manager, touching her bare 
shoulder. &quot;I said&#151;&quot;

Ironic, really, since he never got the chance to say anything ever 
again.

A blazing, bright-gold sword had burnt clean through his gut.

Naturally, people panicked.

The woman left the man to bleed and die, and quietly resumed her hunt 
for an outfit. Some people tried to stop her; she effortlessly cleaved 
them in two, some at the ribcage and others at the pelvis. A police 
officer fired at her, but the energy weapon she wielded, which seemed to 
shoot straight from her hand, transformed itself into a shield, 
devouring all missiles. The shield extended and crushed the officer 
against the wall of the diner, until it burned his flesh and consumed 
him.

The weapon snapped back, like a serpent, as one man rushed after her 
with a steak knife. It lopped off his arm before eating away at his ear, 
then his forehead, then nose, and finally his jaw. She mince-stepped 
over his body, advancing forward, towards a woman she had spotted 
earlier. By her guess, this lady roughly matched up with her height and 
build, and she had the kindness to stay put, too. On her way, for no 
reason other than brief amusement, she killed whom she pleased and 
spared those she wished.

She stopped in her tracks, before the screaming woman, and touched her 
hair. She tried forming words, but she knew none to speak. The woman&#39;s 
children, innocent of the carnage and their own doom, came to battle the 
naked lady, hitting her on her legs and buttocks. She ignored them, and 
stared directly at the woman, who was white with fear. In a flash, the 
children lost their mother; Miss Nudity impaled her directly through the 
top of her head.

She wanted to spare the children. She smiled at them both, wanting 
nothing more than for them to live, and shoved them aside with gentle 
care&#151;because as even she knew, who had not yet been in that world a 
month, there were things much worse than death. She took her time in 
removing the dead woman&#39;s clothes; she took everything, from 
undergarments to jewels, and left nothing except her skin. Now, their 
roles were reversed. What a marvel.

The lady, no longer nude, left the diner quietly, deciding not to kill 
anymore, even if they started first. That was enough for one day. She 
just wanted to leave and go&#151;but where? She didn&#39;t know where to go. She 
just left, and started&#151;where else?&#151;for the center of that rusty town. 
And nobody knew that this woman, beautiful and horrible, had already 
slaughtered dozens without a care.

But of course she had.

She was the goddess of death.

That was her job.

......

A day passed. Fourteen lives, most of them random people, fell to her 
careless hands. She didn&#39;t know who they were, or what they had done, or 
even why she killed them&#151;she just did, and that was that. What other 
reason did she need? Of course, she was still an infant, though her body 
was that of a woman. She had not yet even spoken. She could barely even 
formulate thought. Just kill. And walk. Go. It didn&#39;t matter where. Just 
go. She assumed she&#39;d know the reason soon. Somebody would come along 
and tell her. They would come along and be her guide, and she had the 
distinct feeling that no matter what, she would not be able to kill 
them.

Fifteen. Sixteen. Now eighteen. Now twenty. Now thirty. Those last ten 
were more fun. Her weapon seemed to form all kinds of wonderful shapes, 
unrestricted to any bounds, as she was. It could circle around her as a 
total shield, extend far like a spear, broaden like a great wall, or 
curl and twist so dynamically that nothing could follow or stop it. And 
it always came back, back to...the cylindrical object she had, the one 
that she had found when she was &quot;born&quot;, back at that beach. It was an 
energy weapon, and like her, it did what it pleased. It served her. 
Maybe it was her.

Forty. Forty-one. Forty-two. Forty-four.

Night came. No more. She&#39;d let the rest live. She&#39;d smile at them. And 
vanish.

Morning. Her first sleep. She had slept ten hours. Then came her first 
meal, and her first shower&#151;something told her she&#39;d need one&#151;and her 
first secretion of bodily wastes. Her excrement and urine disgusted her, 
but the young mind she carried with her reasoned that all creatures 
produced waste, and she was no different. The bad came from the good. 
The good came from...... Oh, she did not know, but perhaps she came from 
&quot;that place&quot; as well. She came from &quot;the good place&quot;, and surely, lots 
of bad things were coming from her. Unless death was not bad.

Bacteria devours the rot. It does this so that the rot does not continue 
to live. The vile is wiped away, to make room for more clean. Bacteria 
eats it, makes it go away. So many rotting souls in the world, so little 
time. Something told her that; she didn&#39;t know what. Just kill. And go. 
It doesn&#39;t matter where. She ended up at a bus stop, but at the time, 
she didn&#39;t know it was a bus stop, nor did she even know what a bus was. 
She observed it in secret for a day, and concluded that a bus was simply 
a better means of transporting people around&#151;like walking, but faster. 
The bus ate the people up, and spat the people out. So perhaps it too 
was like her, but why eat and excrete the same thing? Would a bus not 
eat something good and excrete something bad? Yet people came and went. 
And she started to recognize a few. She heard them talking about this 
phenomenon.

&quot;My daily routine,&quot; they said. She couldn&#39;t say it yet. She had a 
feeling she would, soon.

She decided to be eaten by the bus, to see what happened. She went to 
the bus stop and sat down on the bench, like other people had before her 
(her mind wandered off on its first tangent that day, wondering if, like 
her body, her clothes too could be cleaned in a shower&#151;because they were 
starting to smell like excrement). An elderly woman was next to her, 
friendly and dignified, and the quiet woman decided not to kill her. She 
rather liked her.

&quot;Going my way?&quot; said the woman with a twinkle of her eye. The younger 
woman nodded, unable to say Yes. &quot;Oh. I&#39;m going to see my grandson!&quot; she 
added with a proud hiss. &quot;He&#39;s in construction. He says he started on a 
brand-new project, one that will probably be another bank or museum. He 
mostly does museums and banks. Do you have any family?&quot; The goddess of 
death merely frowned. She didn&#39;t know how to answer that. In the back of 
her mind, a memory...

A memory of great fire...

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; said the woman jovially. &quot;I won&#39;t pressure you.&quot; She 
rocked in place and talked about her grandson the construction worker 
until the bus came by. &quot;Well,&quot; she said, &quot;this is it, unless you&#39;re not 
on the 183.&quot; The goddess didn&#39;t know, so she shrugged. The old woman 
found this odd, but ignored her and stepped aboard. The goddess watched 
her reach into her pocket, pull out an orange-colored piece of paper 
with holes in it&#151;&quot;ticket&quot; was the word&#151;and give it to the driver. He 
punched another hole in it!

&quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, hobbling off to the back. He gave the silent 
woman a look of expectancy.

&quot;Well? You getting on?&quot; The goddess wanted to get on. She mimicked the 
old woman, searching pockets she had no idea existed for a ticket that 
might not have been there. As luck had it, though, the woman she had 
stolen the clothes from kept a bus pass, and it had scarcely been used. 
The goddess held it up meekly.

&quot;Come on up, then,&quot; said the driver, like he was talking to a child. She 
stepped up and handed him the ticket. He punched a hole in it, just like 
last time! &quot;Take a seat,&quot; he told her, so she searched the bus for an 
open one. Before walking over there, though, there was one more thing in 
the ritual to cover. She cleared her throat and whispered softly:

&quot;Thank you.&quot; And the goddess of death shuffled off for her seat, and sat 
down. She watched the world go by at an accelerated rate, and stared 
mindlessly. Just go. Just go. Doesn&#39;t matter where. She would...

I will be...

&quot;You will be found, my dear.&quot;

Kali was on the move.

purpose? What is her destination? Is somebody waiting for her? Only some 
questions will have answers in the next chapter, &quot;Dark Scion&quot;. Stay
