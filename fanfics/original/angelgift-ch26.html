<h1>Angel's Gift (part 26 of 36)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/angelgift-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><pre>The sentinel stations were dotted on the edge of the
Empire, massive floating constructs intended for
re-supply and repair of both military and commercial
vessels, as well as to provide an early warning in
case of possible invasion. Several miles across the
oval space station they were approaching was the
nearest one to Earth at only a week&#39;s trip away, as
well as being the one that was on a straight line
course towards Throne world.

&quot;Are we picking up any signs of activity?&quot; Allison
Tennison asked her crew once they finished dropping
out of slip-transit, the cruiser Liberty&#39;s Sword
racing through normal space at a respectable
percentage of the speed of light.

Ensign Kayla Shen shook her head, her pink hair
flowing around her face as the communications officer
answered, &quot;No response to standard hails.&quot;

Amara spoke up from her tactical station, &quot;No energy
readings, Captain, but the station could be in some
kind of silent running mode.&quot;

&quot;Thoughts?&quot; Allison looked towards her second in
command, brown hair falling delicately into the young
captain&#39;s eyes.

&quot;They might go into silent running if there was a
military presence nearby,&quot; Commander Laurel D&#39;ken
confirmed.

Allison made a face then hit a communication device on
her seat as a recorded message rang out,
&quot;Battlestations, all crew report to battlestations.
This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill.&quot;

&quot;Going to half acceleration,&quot; Sharin said from
navigation, the blonde smiling slightly, &quot;military
shields on-line.&quot;

&quot;Glad we had some time to drill,&quot; Jenna murmured,
remaining in her seat by Allison. Normally as a
non-crew member the black haired woman would be asked
to leave the bridge, but under the circumstances they
weren&#39;t going to push it.

On the corner of the main screen Roma&#39;s image popped
up as the android asked, &quot;New orders, Captain?&quot;

&quot;Hang back slightly,&quot; Allison ordered the smaller
patrol craft, &quot;you&#39;ve got an edge in speed and
maneuverability, I&#39;d like to save that for
emergencies.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Roma signed off.

The sleek cruiser slid back, slowing down a bit to
tail the much larger cruiser. Of course the ship was
dwarfed by the station it approached, even as the
station looked small beside the gas giant it orbited,
floating in the rings of ice and rock.

&quot;Shen, try to hail them again,&quot; Allison said as they
swept in to the station.

&quot;Station theta-one,&quot; Kayla said into her voice module,
&quot;this is the heavy cruiser Liberty Sword, please
respond.&quot;

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Amara&#39;s voice was sharp as the tactical
officer reported, &quot;unidentified vessels coming around
the gas giant!&quot;

&quot;Sharin, restore speed and angle us towards them,&quot;
Allison said crisply, &quot;Amara, identify them and what&#39;s
their weapons and shield status?&quot;

&quot;Full speed,&quot; Sharin responded, pressing the smooth
control panel.

&quot;Running sensor data through tactical computers,&quot;
Amara said seriously, &quot;I can tell you that they&#39;re
running with weapons active.&quot;

&quot;Prepare targeting solutions,&quot; Laurel said, &quot;but don&#39;t
lock in, yet.&quot;

Jenna lay her hand on Allison&#39;s arm in silent comfort,
but otherwise she kept quiet. This was Allison&#39;s
moment, in a very real way, as well as her first
chance to use the weeks of training that they had all
been doing. &#39;And she can do this,&#39; she thought calmly.

&quot;Number of vessels?&quot; Allison asked crisply, still only
seeing a few shining specs up on the bridge&#39;s
viewscreen.

&quot;Two vessels,&quot; Alex Keron spoke up from where the
black haired young man worked over the sensors, &quot;looks
like Star Empire ships, though our computers are still
trying to confirm.&quot;

Allison looked over at Laurel even as she dropped her
voice, &quot;I thought the ship&#39;s computers automatically
identified enemy ships?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the theory,&quot; Laurel said wryly, &quot;but we don&#39;t
have much hard data on the Star Empire&#39;s vessels, at
least not when the Sword left. Until we have a few
enemy encounters, the computers won&#39;t be able to
identify them exactly.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Allison muttered.

&quot;Roma and Marilyn are hailing on an encrypted line,&quot;
Kayla reported.

&quot;Put them on,&quot; Allison responded.

The bridge of the smaller vessel was serious as
Marilyn handled her ship with a professionalism very
different from her usual vapid manner. Beside her Roma
looked up grimly, &quot;I assume new orders, ma&#39;am?&quot;

&quot;Take advantage of whatever cover you can to get
behind those ships,&quot; Allison said crisply, &quot;if they
prove to be hostile, use your initiative.&quot;

&quot;Will do,&quot; Marilyn nodded, then they signed off.

They slid through the gas giant&#39;s debris rings,
massive bands of dust and ice that were held by the
massive proto-world&#39;s gravity field. On the screen the
shapes of the other ships began to come into
resolution, the bulky, round shapes that were studded
by triangular constructions.

&quot;Until we have confirmation that these are enemy
vessels,&quot; Allison said as she studied the images, &quot;I
want you to hold fire, Amara. If these are friendlies,
we don&#39;t want to be responsible for shooting them
down.&quot; She smiled without humor, &quot;Of course, if they
shoot at us you&#39;re free to blow them out of space.&quot;

Amara smiled slightly, &quot;Got it.&quot;

&quot;Kayla, any progress on contacting the station?&quot;
Laurel asked thoughtfully.

&quot;Still silent,&quot; Kayla answered. She touched her
headpiece, her eyes widening slightly, &quot;We&#39;re being
hailed by the ships!&quot;

&quot;On screen!&quot; Allison barked.

The older man who stared out of the screen had a
thoughtful expression on his face, his gray tinted
black hair swept back from his face. He looked mostly
human, as far as that went, only the violet color of
his eyes and the oddly pointed look to his face making
him as non-human.

&quot;Unknown vessel,&quot; Allison said carefully, &quot;this is
Captain Tennison of the Empire starship, Liberty&#39;s
Sword. You are trespassing in Empire space, please
explain your presence here.&quot;

&quot;Unknown vessel?&quot; he raised an eyebrow. &quot;I would have
thought you&#39;d recognize a Star Empire destroyer by
now, we&#39;ve defeated enough of your ships with them,&quot;
he smirked. He leaned forward, &quot;Well I am Captain
Taiho, and we&#39;re here to claim that station.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t let you do that,&quot; Allison
responded, surprised at how calm she felt.

&quot;And how do you plan to stop me?&quot; Taiho asked. He
shook his head &quot;Our destroyers both out mass and out
gun you.&quot;

From out of the atmosphere of the gas giant the patrol
boat emerged, coming up silently behind the two
destroyers, electronic countermeasures making the
smaller ship nearly invisible. Buying time Allison
said, &quot;I must formally request you leave this system.&quot;

Taiho actually laughed. &quot;You can&#39;t back that up,&quot; he
scoffed, &quot;and if you&#39;re counting on the station for
aid, don&#39;t. The electromagnetic pulse-wave we hit them
with fried all non-shielded electronics on the
station, they&#39;re helpless.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I wasn&#39;t planning on relying on them,&quot; Allison
said as Roma brought their small craft within point
blank range of the Destroyers. &quot;Now!&quot;

With savage glee Amara activated their weapons even as
Sharin began to move their ship. Energy cannons and
missiles raced out, locked on the enemy even as they
moved to dodge. Taking the cure Roma and Marilyn
opened fire, taking one Destroyer completely by
surprise.

With it&#39;s shields focused on the front the energy
weapons of the patrol boat cut through the ship&#39;s hull
with ease. Lancing right through layers of armor,
electronics and conduits they stabbed into the engine
room, slicing into the fusion bottles that powered the
great vessel. In conjunction with the fire from
Liberty&#39;s Sword it was enough to turn it into a
fireball.

The tide turned, the superiority of numbers reversing
itself in a shocking instant. The second destroyer,
reeling from the destruction of it&#39;s brother and under
heavy fire from both vessels chose the better part of
valor and began to pull away, moving faster and faster
as it went.

&quot;Should we pursue?&quot; Sharin asked eagerly.

&quot;no,&quot; Allison said firmly, &quot;we&#39;ve done enough, for
now.&quot; She paused, expression going grim, &quot;And we need
to make sure the crew of the station are all right,
too.&quot;</pre>
