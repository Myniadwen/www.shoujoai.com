Stage Eight: Holly&#39;s Bliss/Cassie&#39;s Heartbreak 

**********

The morning after the night that two people make love was always 
important. 

For those who slept around and mislead others into believing that one 
night of sex meant something, their sudden absence was proof of the 
opposite. Harsh but informative. However, when two people really cared 
about each other; the morning after was completely different. This was 
the time when you reflect. When you think about how lucky you are to be 
where you are. To look on the one you had been so close to and 
contemplate what the future would hold for the two of you. The morning 
after Debbie and Linda had resolved their issues... was no different to 
that at all.

The two lay amid the lengthy snowy white spread over Debbie&#39;s bed. Naked 
bodies and limbs interlocking, pressed together, holding each other, 
sharing each others warmth. By now Linda had awoken. It was clearly 
morning. Light peered between the slight gaps between the curtains of 
the far window. But unlike her, Debbie was still asleep. She was tired, 
even from before their lovemaking last night. But that was 
understandable. This whole thing had been hard on the two of them. Even 
more so for Debbie. Something that the other woman could see quite 
plainly. Linda rolled over slightly so she could take a better look at 
her other half. 

Debbie&#39;s long black hair fell in strands over her pale milky skin so 
elegantly. Even in this bright morning, after their long, long, *long* 
night of soul-shattering love making, Debbie Harding still retained that 
wonderful air of dignity and sophistication. And it made Linda wonder 
why she needed to think so hard about her choice of commitment. To 
simply look at this beautiful, intelligent woman made the answer so 
obvious. But that was for the past now. Now all they had to think about 
was the future. How they would handle things from now on. That would be 
their focus. If through nothing more than playfulness, Linda smiled 
softly and brought her hand over to the left cheek of her lover. Then 
began a slow stroking motion, pushing back the stray strands of Debbie&#39;s 
raven hair until it was nestled peacefully behind her ear. 

Though she didn&#39;t intend to wake the sleeping historian, that was the 
outcome. 

A small moan of stirring was released from her throat. And Debbie&#39;s 
eyelids fluttered open to see that glorious image of a naked Linda lying 
beside her. Linda widened her smile and let her soft hand come to rest 
on Debbie&#39;s cheek. &quot;Sorry, Debs. Did I wake you up?&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s okay,&quot; The History teacher replied gently, &quot;...I&#39;m just glad 
that we worked everything out. And that you&#39;re here with me now.&quot; 

Linda looked upwards to the ceiling for a second. &quot;Not everything. We 
still haven&#39;t decided who&#39;s going to live with who yet.&quot;

That had actually been a thought on Debbie&#39;s mind. &quot;...Yes. I don&#39;t know 
how to say this, but... I feel a lot more comfortable here. And I don&#39;t 
think moving Edward to a new home so soon would be a good thing.&quot;

&quot;...Right,&quot; And Linda had actually forgotten about that cat, &quot;I guess 
I&#39;ll be moving here then. It&#39;s a nice house. And we could have a nice 
set up here. You could make me breakfast in bed and service me anytime 
you want...&quot;

Debbie chuckled and playfully tapped Linda on the shoulder. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think so. If you think I&#39;m becoming your housewife then you&#39;ve got 
another thing coming.&quot;

To that Linda laughed back. But such light-hearted moments would always 
remind her of how close she came to losing it all. &quot;..I&#39;m so sorry I put 
through all that.&quot;

And somehow Debbie could see how much that guilt was effecting Linda. 
But that was in the past now. She had to know that that was where it 
belonged. In the past. &quot;...Let&#39;s just forget about that for now. All I 
care about is you. And how we can make this work between the two of us. 
Okay?&quot;

That was all that mattered in the end. Linda pulled another smile to 
eliminate her frown. And she touched her love in a soft caress of the 
cheek. They had each other. Forever. Everything that had happened before 
to un-shake this moment was over and done with.  &quot;Okay.&quot;

**********

Shannon Marson heaved another sigh.

It had been a long day yesterday. After that &#39;Alyshia&#39; had called her a 
bitch, she had been in one hell of a funk. Taking most of it out on 
those around her. Which continued when she went home and had to hear her 
sister Terri&#39;s overabundant stereo system blaring out rock tunes 
throughout the night. But today she felt no better. When she awoke this 
morning she felt like just skipping school all together to hit the mall 
with whomever would be willing to skip school to join her. But something 
told her to just swallow her pride and come in today. If not to show her 
face then to spite Alyshia, whom she had more than a few nasty words to 
exchange with.  In the end it was a good thing that she did show up for 
school today. Because someone was about to come in. Someone who 
completely turned heads. And little to the immediate knowledge of those 
who dared to look...

...she had been there the whole time.

Shannon eased back on one of the five wooden benches that were erected 
against the far wall of the outer courtyard. Alongside her were her 
friends, Chloe and Michelle. If you could consider Shannon as some sort 
of &#39;queen&#39; of Atlantic High School&#39;s popularity caste, then Chloe and 
Michelle had to shortly below her as the barons of the shire. But while 
Shannon was mildly conceited, Chloe was far more narcissistic and had no 
small sense of self-expression. Though her overall attitude was far less 
arrogant than Shannon&#39;s was. 

And Michelle? 

Well she was the rare kind of popular girl in this school who had a 
caring side to her. Often she stood at the sidelines, tempering 
Shannon&#39;s bitchy qualities towards those that actually deserved it. In 
this aim, Michelle was largely unsuccessful. But she still stuck by 
Shannon&#39;s side through nothing more than her own feelings. It was *not* 
common knowledge, but... Michelle had her own little thing for Miss 
Marson. Hence her apparent jealousy toward Ella, the star Spanish 
cheerleader who was, supposedly, Shannon&#39;s &#39;favourite&#39;. 

This was by no means the limit of Shannon&#39;s posse. At the very least she 
had around ten girls in her Trendies clique, but these two, Michelle and 
Chloe, were the cream. The rump. Those that Shannon could truly call 
friends in any situation, good or bad. 

Chloe absently tugged on one of the curled locks of her sandy brown 
hair,  whilst watching most of the other student pour into school from 
the far gates. &quot;Meh. I didn&#39;t finish that English essay thing we were 
given by that butt-ugly substitute yesterday. Think that Miss Blake&#39;ll 
show up for school today?&quot;

&quot;Who cares?&quot; Shannon shot back, resting her cheek on her palm, &quot;I can&#39;t 
believe I came in today. Man, I am so totally bored of this dump. I 
should have just stayed home all day like my sister does. That lucky 
pot-smoking headbanger.&quot;

Michelle looked over at the irate Shannon, from her standing position on 
the other side of the lengthy wooden bench they gathered around. &quot;...Is 
this about what that girl said to you yesterday?&quot;

&quot;Screw her!&quot; Shannon responded, reprimanding, &quot;I couldn&#39;t care less 
about that stocky loudmouth. Just don&#39;t feel like working today. I 
shouldn&#39;t have dragged myself here again.&quot;

And so Michelle silenced herself. &quot;Okay then...&quot;

But it was when Chloe noticed someone at the gates that the focus of 
their conversation changed completely. She was not someone they didn&#39;t 
know... but they themselves weren&#39;t aware of that at the beginning. 
Chloe abandoned playing with her more-than-well-kept hair to point out 
what she saw. At the gates of the far wall was a pack of young men. Guys 
who obviously went to the counterpart school to this one, 
Saffron-Jameson, which was just a short ways away from here. There was 
about four of them. And they huddled around a cute young woman who had 
been having this effect all morning. The men did not follow her inside 
the school (that would technically be trespassing) and so she waved them 
a fond goodbye as she went inside the school walls. Shannon stood up to 
get a better look at this girl. Though she didn&#39;t want to admit it to 
herself, whoever that girl was, she was... really pretty. Really, 
really, REALLY pretty. She travelled in swift (and yet adorably awkward) 
steps across the stone of the courtyard on black club heels shoes. They 
were not necessarily very graceful, but they actually complimented her 
smooth, bare legs. The mystery girl also wore a mid-length denim skirt 
that cut off around her knees. And her upper body was enswathed with a 
simple white blouse that had a wide pink heart at the front. Her beach 
sand blonde hair was primed upwards in wavy curls, no bangs, allowing 
her dark sapphire eyes to be observed without any sort of constraint 
whatsoever. 

Shannon couldn&#39;t recognize her. She had to be a new girl. But whoever 
she was, the Marson girl found herself kind of liking her. So she told 
Chloe and Michelle to stay put while she went over there to see who this 
was. Which Shannon did. After easing herself off the bench she walked 
over to the new girl and stopped just when they came into reach of each 
other. 

&quot;Uh... Hi there...&quot; Shannon spoke, disturbingly polite. 

The moment the new girl saw Shannon, her expression changed from 
blushing and shy to angry and downtrodden. Shannon watched as the 
mystery blonde&#39;s brow creased, looking away with spite. &quot;...What do you 
want? What did I do wrong now?&quot;

Suddenly the vocals that went behind the new girl&#39;s image gave away the 
fact that she wasn&#39;t so new. Shannon froze, almost paralysed, knowing 
full well to whom that timid voice belonged. And it confused her to no 
end. &quot;...Cassie?&quot;

And sure as hell, it was. The taller blonde couldn&#39;t believe it. It was 
like some sick spin-off of &#39;She&#39;s All That&#39;. Gone were the braces.  Gone 
were the thick nerdish glasses. The normally unkempt hair was now tidy. 
The fashion disasters that had been Cassie&#39;s main bag had been binned 
along with the lack of make-up. The young woman had made an entire 
switch around that had changed her image radically. Her face had gone 
from (at the best) quaint; to (at the worst) very cute. She wasn&#39;t 
necessarily a supermodel now... but Cassie had changed herself in such a 
way that Shannon could hardly recognize her. The only thing that 
resembled her previous look was the voice itself. Aside from that...

When the new and improved Cassie saw that Shannon was too confused to 
say anything more, she walked off as quickly as she could. Different 
look or not, she still felt intimidated by her trendy-borne nemesis. 
There was nothing she could do to get over that. But Cassie did have to 
admit; she felt a lot more confident like this. Not because she looked 
great. At the end of the day, Cassie felt as she always did, regardless. 
But because... for the first time in her short life, people were 
beginning to actually notice her. She no longer felt invisible or 
obscure. And that feeling was really welcomed. It was a clear change 
that was long overdue in her own humble opinion. She just hoped that it 
would work with Holly-Raine. And that was who all this was really for. 
Dear sweet Holly-Raine. Talking with Linda/Miss Blake yesterday had 
helped Cassie out in a lot of ways. Now she really felt like she could 
do this. She truly felt like she was ready to admit her feelings, even 
if a little nervousness was there.

The young girl walked around one of the main buildings to a quiet side 
area where there were a couple of vending machines. She knew that Holly 
liked to come here in the mornings and buy a little candy bar for 
herself before she went to class. Cassie&#39;s plan was to wait there until 
Holly arrived. But thankfully, Holly-Raine was already there. Looking as 
cute and gorgeous as she always did, but with an extra special smile on 
her face. Acknowledging that this was the time for action... Cassie 
strode over there and swallowed the lump in her throat. If she could 
have controlled her heartbeat she would have, but for now it would just 
have to wait. 

Holly didn&#39;t look up from the vending machine until she felt a tap on 
her shoulder a few seconds later. The shoulder-length hair on the beauty 
swung around whilst she turned to see this person. And she looked Cassie 
up and down with a pleasantly approving smile, which, had of Cassie 
understood it, would have made her blush.

But Cassie was the first to speak. &quot;...Hi.&quot;

&quot;Hey...&quot; Holly spoke back, &quot;...Do we know each other? You look sort of 
familiar... but I can&#39;t remember seeing you before-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Cassie Robbins,&quot; The blonde girl answered swiftly, &quot;Were in Miss 
Blake&#39;s English class together. I guess... you didn&#39;t really notice me 
all that much...&quot;

Truth be told, Holly-Raine could hardly picture herself ignoring someone 
as cute as this... but she had no idea what Cassie looked like 
previously. Again, because she paid very little in the way of attention 
towards her. &quot;Oh. I&#39;m sorry about that. So... did you want something 
from the machine or what?&quot;

The timid Cassie shook her head for a no. &quot;...Uh... no. Um... I was 
wondering... if I could just talk to you privately for a few minutes? 
Please?&quot;

It was the &#39;please&#39; in that statement that made Holly think that this 
was important to the other girl. So she really didn&#39;t want to upset her 
about it by saying no. &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;

And so the two of them walked over to a more secluded area behind the 
building. Not many people came around here unless they wanted some kind 
of privacy to say something. So it was quite empty. Holly and Cassie 
stopped in this area and turned to each other. And during this moment 
the blonde student couldn&#39;t help but take a few lengthy glances at the 
girl her heart had been desiring for so long. Holly-Raine was still so 
devastatingly adorable. She still had the innate power to turn Cassie&#39;s 
knees and heart to mush, regardless of how ignorant Holly actually was 
of it. 

And when Cassie did nothing BUT stare at her, Holly opened up the waning 
discussion again. &quot;...You wanted to tell me something, right?&quot;

Cassie shook herself out of her stupor and concentrated on the task at 
hand. Presenting what she felt once and for all. &quot;R-right. I&#39;m sorry, 
I&#39;m... kinda nervous...  about saying this. But I wanted to tell you 
this... for so long now... I just have to say it...&quot;

&quot;Then spill it.&quot; Holly muttered simplistically, shrugging. 

Crunch time. &quot;...I...I...I... like you. A lot. I... don&#39;t just... like 
you... I think... that I... might... sort of... be... kinda... in... 
love... with you...&quot;

Following that there was a silence. A kind of throbbing silence that 
hung so thick in the air that the breeze of the wind sounded like the 
loudest thing on earth. And Cassie&#39;s heart sank violently when she 
looked into the vacant expression pasted over Holly-Raine&#39;s face. There 
was no freak-out, no acceptance of love and equal expression of it; just 
vacuous silence. The first tear started to well in Cassie&#39;s eye. And 
they were about to be followed by a hell of a lot more. She turned away 
in embarrassment and heartache, until Holly clasped her hand to prevent 
her from leaving.

And now Cassie didn&#39;t know what to think. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry... I&#39;m so 
sorry... I&#39;m a freak...&quot;

&quot;Hold up a second,&quot; Holly said, &quot;...You&#39;re in love with me?&quot;

She couldn&#39;t bear to say it again so she just nodded, straining in vain 
to hold back her tears in front of the girl whom she had loved for so 
long. Holly released Cassie&#39;s wrist and her eyes widened in surprise. 
&quot;...Wow... I didn&#39;t know... this is the first time someone&#39;s ever said 
that they&#39;re in love with me...&quot;

Cassie swallowed nervously with watering eyes. &quot;...You... hate me... 
right?&quot;

&quot;Why would I hate you?&quot;

Suddenly things just started seem less important around here. Cassie 
focused on Holly-Raine and only Holly-Raine, to adjust to the words that 
she just heard from those beautiful, parted pink lips. Holly didn&#39;t hate 
her. And when the words sunk in the tears were held back. But for Cassie 
to believe that that was the tip of the iceberg of happiness... would 
have been very premature. But Holly smiled one of those dazzling, 
alluring smiles as she spoke again.

&quot;Look, I&#39;ll be honest,&quot; She began, &quot;I&#39;ve never been interested in guys. 
Not in the least. Why buy a hotdog when you can have a cherry pie, 
right?&quot;

A small smile was finally pulled onto Cassie&#39;s lips. 

And Holly continued. &quot;...I&#39;m really flattered. No one&#39;s ever told me 
that they love me that way before. I guess I was just a little... 
shocked. And you&#39;re a really pretty girl... if you told me this just a 
couple days ago... I would been all over you, but...&quot;

The word &#39;but&#39; suddenly burst Cassie&#39;s bubble. &quot;...But...?&quot; 

&quot;...But last night,&quot; Fond thoughts of Holly&#39;s ruthlessly intense night 
with Sharon Daniels now made one hell of a comeback, &quot;...I was with this 
girl who really did a number on me. I guess I&#39;m starting to feel about 
her... the way you do about me, so... I really don&#39;t think... that 
anything can happen between us. At least not now. You... do understand, 
right?&quot;

Any brief reprieve Cassie had gotten from the tyrant of heartbreak was 
now all forgotten. The beautiful words coming out of Holly&#39;s beautiful 
mouth in each beautiful decibel had an opposite effect to the way they 
were intended. Each sentence struck Cassie down like a deer in the 
crosshairs of a poacher&#39;s gun. Not only had Holly slept with someone 
else, not only had she fallen for this person, not only were Cassie&#39;s 
feelings unrequited; but the dull, nasty, ironic joke of it all was 
that... if she had spoken her feelings earlier... this could have all 
been avoided. The rush of shock that infected every inch of Cassie 
Robbins&#39; being was completely immobilizing. She was so stunned by her 
agony that she could hardly speak.

And guilt (something that was usually quite foreign to Holly) had a 
manifestation. &quot;...I&#39;m really sorry, Cassie... I know that you probably 
didn&#39;t wanna hear that. But... I&#39;m sure that you&#39;ll find someone else... 
and... I wouldn&#39;t mind being friends if you don&#39;t.&quot;

Cassie said nothing. 

Feeling that the offer of friendship just wasn&#39;t quite enough (then 
again, nothing really would be) Holly-Raine exhaled and stepped just a 
little ways closer to the stunned blonde. Cassie&#39;s own frozen nature 
ended for the production of a tearful gasp, as Holly leaned over to her 
cheek, and placed a tender, affable, friendship kiss on it. One that 
both warmed Cassie&#39;s heart and chilled it. Upon that overt realization 
that that was ALL she would ever get. Holly stepped back with a sheepish 
half-smile on her face. &quot;I&#39;m really sorry. I think I should be going 
now.&quot;

Which she did. Cassie silently watched the love of her life, 
Holly-Raine, back-step and then walk around the side of the building, 
probably towards its front door. Classes started soon. She was probably 
heading for her first one. The silence she left behind was short. 
Wracking sobs filled the vapour of the air. Cassie did nothing to hide 
them. She simply let her head lull and emptied her heart in the only way 
that she could. But what she didn&#39;t realize was that she was not alone. 

A third voice came. &quot;...I&#39;m so sorry, Cassie...&quot;

The tearful girl turned around to see Alyshia standing a short ways 
behind at the side of the building. But Cassie didn&#39;t respond to it. 
Just looked at the taller woman with eyes that so clearly reflected her 
disappointment. Before she knew it, Alyshia was jogging over to her, 
wrapping her in a hug to help her through it. Cassie hugged her back, 
holding her friend with sobs that broke into the outright wails of 
crying. And the two remained that way.

Cassie had revealed her feelings to Holly-Raine, finally...

...but without the result she so desperately wanted. 

**********

Summer was in a bad mood.

Yesterday she had bought three albums and two singles that she really 
liked. She went home and listened to all of them whilst finishing up 
some homework she had to hand in to Miss Harding for History Class. A 
report on the 1920&#39;s Market Crash. Boring as it was on the whole to her, 
Summer managed to get through it with some music in the background. And 
she ordered out (like she normally did when she didn&#39;t feel like 
cooking), she called Jenny and spoke with her a few hours before hitting 
the sack. But through it all, a typically normal day, Summer was not 
happy. It didn&#39;t show much, even Jenny couldn&#39;t notice it, but it was 
there. Like a chip on her shoulder. Summer could feel something... 
bothering her.  The more she thought about it, the more she saw Holly. 
And this picture she had of Holly wasn&#39;t one that Summer enjoyed. 
Because right next to Holly, in that picture, was Sharon. 

The image of the two of them. 

Not as friends, not as acquaintances, but as lovers. 

Acting together in the same way that Holly and Summer had been during 
her party. And that image was really affecting her. Even as she tried to 
sleep last night, this idea, this notion, that Holly-Raine and Sharon 
were a couple, invaded her mind each moment. And it... disturbed Summer 
in so many ways. Seeing the two of them together bothered her. It 
bothered her that it bothered her. And it was the idea that this might 
actually mean something that was the hardest to accept. But what DID it 
mean? Surely... she couldn&#39;t actually have... romantic feelings for one 
of her best friends... could she? But then what else would it be? Summer 
and Holly had agreed that what happened between them at the party would 
just be one night. Nothing more, no pressure, no baggage. And at the 
time, Summer really did feel that way. But now... the idea that Holly 
might be doing to someone else what she did to Summer herself was 
alarming. It set off danger bells inside the pretty platinum-haired teen 
that did not bode well. And more worrying was the fact that the other 
third in this equation was Sharon Daniels. 

Sharon had this disturbingly frequent habit of getting whatever she 
wanted. And sure, Summer wasn&#39;t completely sure about what Sharon&#39;s 
sexuality was, but from what Jenny had said yesterday, there was a 
closeness she was forming with Holly. Summer didn&#39;t like that idea at 
all. But what could she really do about it? It wasn&#39;t like she had any 
REAL proof that something was going on between Sharon and Holly. And 
even if there was, Summer could not stand in the way of it. At least not 
willingly. Holly was one of her best friends above all else. That 
mattered most.

...Still...

...Summer wasn&#39;t prepared to let this rest.

The young woman walked alongside Jenny and, believe it or not, Sharon. 
Summer and Jenny normally walked to school together but they had run 
into Sharon on the way. Holly had left her house early, and had called 
Jenny in the morning to confirm that. So they all expected to meet up 
with her at school. And as soon as Sharon joined she and Jenny, Summer 
began taking oblivious, mental notes of the dark-haired newbie. One most 
conspicuous was the first thing that Sharon asked upon seeing Summer and 
Jenny. Something along the lines of;

&#39;Hey, guys. Where&#39;s Holly...?&#39;

Though Summer knew that was very little to base her suspicions upon, her 
own personal confusions were now moderating the forum. She couldn&#39;t have 
held them back even if she wanted to. The three girls walked down the 
quiet residential street that was their shortcut to Atlantic High. But 
as they moved on Jenny saw a certain someone she was more than happy to 
see. Nathan. The charismatic football player whom had made quite the 
impression on little Jenny during Summer&#39;s party.

&quot;Nathan!&quot; Jenny yelled as she saw him, &quot;Over here!&quot;

He looked back and delivered one hell of a favourable smile. Though 
Jenny was the one to call him, she quickly crossed over the road to meet 
up with him. They soon began to talk between themselves, well out of 
earshot. Sharon and Summer stopped to wait for her to finish her 
conversation with the guy. Just until they started making out.

Sharon grinned childishly. &quot;That guy her boyfriend or something?&quot;

&quot;...I guess so,&quot; Summer said with a sigh. But more important questions 
were on her mind now. Ones that were sensitive... but needed to be 
answered, &quot;...Look, Sharon, can I ask you something...?&quot;

The black-haired woman looked over. &quot;If this is about that Green Day CD 
I borrowed from you then I&#39;ll give it back as soon as I make a copy of 
it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not about that,&quot; Summer said, shaking her head, &quot;it&#39;s about you 
and Holly-Raine. Is there something going... that I should know about?&quot;

A satisfied grin came from Sharon&#39;s face when Holly&#39;s name was spoken. 
Summer did notice this but at that point did nothing to address it. 
&quot;She&#39;s a nice girl. Just like you said she was. And we saw a movie last 
night, but it sort of freaked her out, so I took her home. Why?&quot;

Summer looked away uneasily. &quot;...I&#39;m just asking. Jenny said that 
something might be...&quot;

&quot;What are you getting at, Summer?&quot; Sharon questioned.

&quot;I was just thinking...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; The dark-haired teen asked, &quot;that I&#39;d lead her &#39;astray&#39; or 
something?&quot;

Summer shook her head. &quot;...I just get worried about her sometimes, 
alright? It&#39;s not that big a deal. She&#39;s one of my best friends. We look 
out for each other.&quot;

Sharon took that comment at face value. She stuffed her left hand into 
her jeans pocket and exhaled, looking off into the distance. She herself 
wasn&#39;t ready to tell anyone about what happened last night. She was in 
no way ashamed of what she and Holly had done, but she didn&#39;t know if 
Holly-Raine was being open about it. And Sharon wouldn&#39;t say anything 
unless Holly wanted her to. Plus, she was now getting the accurate 
feeling that Summer might not be too pleased with the whole idea. Which 
was understandable in its own way. How could you go up to someone and 
say; &#39;hey, I fucked your best friend silly all night!&#39; to them? For now 
Sharon would keep quiet. But for how long? That remained to be answered.

**********

&quot;How&#39;s your ice cream?&quot;

&quot;...It&#39;s okay... I guess...&quot;

She was still a little shaky. Which was to be expected. Alyshia sighed 
when she looked at this sight. Dear sweet Cassie, so heartbroken and 
shattered. The spirit-dampening frown didn&#39;t suit her pretty little 
face. Not even in the least. Once Cassie had calmed down enough from 
crying to tell Alyshia that she couldn&#39;t face anyone else the way she 
felt, the decision had been made. Alyshia helped sneak Cassie back out 
of school. Though the shorter blonde was not the type of person to skip 
school ( a well established fact) even a blind man could see that Cassie 
was in no fit state for schoolwork. They&#39;d have to make their excuses 
somehow later on. But for now, what mattered was making things as easy 
as possible for Cassie. It was obviously no consolation to be taken to 
an ice cream parlour. But it was a relatively hot day out. And it was 
better to start somewhere. As soon as they got to the nearby ice cream 
place (and they were surprisingly rare in Victoria) they sat down and 
ordered a couple sundaes. 

Cassie obviously wasn&#39;t hungry.

By the time the sundaes (strawberry and vanilla with chocolate 
sprinkles) had been brought over to the two of them, Cassie had a little 
more control over herself. Though there were tear tracks ruining the 
little make-up she had applied to herself, and she was still a bit 
shaky, the blonde was doing better than before. Her sobs had ended as 
did her erratic breathing. She couldn&#39;t truthfully say that she was 
feeling better but it was a start. 

However Cassie didn&#39;t eat her sundae. She swirled it around absently 
with her elongated spoon, throwing longing glances out the window every 
now and again. She didn&#39;t eat. Much to Alyshia&#39;s dismay.   

But to keep things moving, she opened up speech between the two of them. 
&quot;So how long have you... felt that way about that girl?&quot;

&quot;...Six months...&quot; Cassie replied. It was probably a bit longer than 
that. But it was six months ago when Cassie realized how strongly she 
felt, &quot;...six whole months...&quot;

Alyshia tried to smile a bit. &quot;...Well... I know it probably doesn&#39;t 
help much, but, I think that girl&#39;s crazy to pass someone like you up. 
You know?&quot;

She was right. It didn&#39;t help much. Cassie cast an expressionless gaze 
down at the rim of the tall glass that held her ice cream. And gave off 
a little shrug. Something that didn&#39;t exactly look like a good sign. But 
Alyshia was sure that getting Cassie to open up *would* help matters. 
The challenge would be to get her to do that. After taking another swift 
bite out of her sundae, Alyshia spoke again. 

&quot;...I really like the ice cream here,&quot; Irrelevant as that comment was, 
it was certainly better than not talking at all, &quot;...cheaper here too, 
better than most places. I guess that&#39;s why I brought us here.&quot;

Cassie didn&#39;t immediately reply. She said nothing at first. Then, a few 
seconds later, she looked over at Alyshia across that window side table 
with a inquiring gaze on her face. &quot;...I&#39;ve been wasting so much of my 
time, haven&#39;t I?&quot;

Alyshia blinked. &quot;...What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;...Doing all of this,&quot; Cassie looked down at herself scornfully, 
&quot;...dressing up... the make-up... spending half my pay check on a hairdo 
I don&#39;t even like... wearing an outfit I&#39;ll probably never put on 
again... what was the point...? When Holly doesn&#39;t feel the same? Linda 
was right... I should have waited... or said something sooner...&quot;

Again Alyshia was a little confused. &quot;...Linda?&quot;

&quot;Miss Blake,&quot; Cassie answered, &quot;I saw her before I got my braces 
removed. She said that I should tell her only if I was &#39;prepared for the 
consequences&#39;. And I wasn&#39;t. I wasn&#39;t at all. And now I just... I 
just...&quot;

The large spoon in Alyshia&#39;s hands was put down. &quot;...You don&#39;t have to 
say anything if you really don&#39;t want to. And the way you feel right 
now... you probably just wanna go home. After we&#39;re done here... do you 
want me to take you home...?&quot;

Cassie just nodded, rubbing her hand over her eyes to ease away the 
moisture that was gathering up there. At this point, the only thing she 
could think about was how lousy she felt. But it was lucky that she had 
someone to rely on now. 

**********

Summer, Sharon and Jenny (whom had a brilliant smile on her face from 
the little time she recently spent with her boyfriend) approached the 
gates of Atlantic High. And none too early. Classes were just about to 
get underway. The final bunch of girls on their way came through 
alongside them. The three walked across the school courtyard straight 
into the main building at its centre. First class for Summer and Jenny 
this morning was English. Which didn&#39;t apply to Sharon because her 
opening class was Math. 

Jenny opened the door of the stairwell that led up to the English 
department, and there were mixed reactions as all three girls saw 
Holly-Raine standing at the top of the stairs, a few other students 
passing her by. Jenny gave a normal &#39;hey holly&#39; as ever she did. Summer 
and Sharon were not as bland. But while Summer&#39;s reaction to seeing her 
was somehow uncomfortable, Sharon pulled somewhat of a lustful smile. 
Holly-Raine was just as pleased to see her. But not as talkative as 
usual. Sharon just took that as a harmless reluctance to admit their 
relationship in front of her friends. Simple enough. 

&quot;Hey guys,&quot; Holly said briefly, &quot;You&#39;re kinda late.&quot;

Jenny winked at her. &quot;That&#39;s kinda my fault. We ran into Nathan on the 
way here and well, you know that a girl has her needs, right?&quot;

Holly-Raine probably understood that better than anyone else. And while 
Summer began to follow Jenny towards the English department, she looked 
back when she realized that Holly and Sharon weren&#39;t moving an inch. 

Suspicions began to run high again. &quot;...Holly? Aren&#39;t you coming?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll catch you guys up,&quot; The brown-haired vixen replied, &quot;I have to 
steal Sharon for a little while so I can talk to her about something. If 
Miss Blake&#39;s back then tell her I&#39;m just finishing up that book report I 
owe her, alright?&quot;

Summer&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;...But...&quot;

However Jenny prevented her from saying anything more out of nothing 
more than a sheer reluctance to be late. So she grabbed her friend but 
the arm and made a quick stride for Miss Blake&#39;s English room. Once all 
eyes were gone and all ears were absent, Sharon walked up to Holly and 
swiftly claimed a kiss for her own. The slighter shorter youth moaned 
delicately into the kiss and remained perfectly still as Sharon wound 
her thin but strong arms around Holly&#39;s waist. 

She pulled back a few long seconds afterwards. &quot;...Sharon...&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t wait to see you again,&quot; The dark-haired beauty began playing 
with a strand of Holly&#39;s shoulder-length auburn hair, &quot;when I went home 
last night I couldn&#39;t get you outta my head. How come you walked by 
yourself?&quot;

&quot;...&#39;Cause you&#39;re a friend of Summer&#39;s,&quot; Holly-Raine spoke, &quot;I don&#39;t 
want her to know anything about us just yet. You&#39;re the first girl I&#39;ve 
ever wanted to really be with... but I don&#39;t want Summer to think I&#39;m 
just... &#39;pouncing&#39; on her other friends.&quot;

Sharon smirked. &quot;I don&#39;t think you have to worry about that. She seemed 
more worried about you than me this morning.&quot;

&quot;Why? What did she say?&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; Sharon claimed, shrugging, &quot;...so. Feel like a quick 
jump before class?&quot;

Whatever seriousness Holly had been humbled into by the revelation of 
Cassie&#39;s feelings was now tossed to the wayside. A mischievous smile 
appeared on her cute features. And before she knew it, Sharon was 
whisking her off to somewhere different. A storeroom that was just down 
the corridor. Which usually would be locked, but the janitors around 
this school could be as lazy as the students, something that Sharon had 
come to realize in the time she had been here. The two then ambled into 
the storeroom quickly, closing the door behind them. It wasn&#39;t the 
safest place or even the most romantic; but there was nothing really 
romantic in what they had planned. Holly backed up against the wall in 
this small storage room (which was more like a cupboard, only 2x2.5 
metres in size) while Sharon secured the door. As soon as she finished 
she turned to Holly with a look of animalistic lust that so greatly 
showed the passion that was going on between the two of them. And they 
acted on it. Sharon quickly drew Holly into herself with a claiming 
embrace. Their lips were pressed together in another desperate kiss. The 
emerald-eyed teen sighed against her lover and ran her hands straight up 
her firm but soft back. Holly&#39;s hands slid up the grooves of Sharon&#39;s 
black leather jacket, right until they were entangled in her masses of 
lengthy midnight black hair. Sharon soon parted her mouth in their kiss. 
Which signalled a green light for the other girl. Who quickly let her 
probing tongue slide into the new opening uninhibited. All the while, 
Sharon&#39;s hands found a firm grasp upon that cute little button ass of 
Holly&#39;s. Something she was beginning to realize she had fondness for.

Thankfully the storage room they had presently occupied was soundproof. 
If it hadn&#39;t have been, any odd passer-by would have been more than 
likely to hear the smacking of lips or stray breathless sighs. 

Holly&#39;s breath quivered when she felt Sharon squeeze upon the small, 
soft globes of her ass. But slowly, one of those hands left their post 
and began inching its way around the hem of her skirt. Which Holly was 
even more pleased to see. While Sharon&#39;s tongue jousted with Holly&#39;s in 
their kiss, her hand slid itself up the girl&#39;s short skirt and pressed 
against the panties that were covering up her crotch. The minutely 
shorter girl trembled when she felt Sharon&#39;s bare hand against her most 
private of areas. Sharon couldn&#39;t help but think warmly of herself and 
her work when the wetness that was dampening Holly&#39;s panties became oh 
so apparent. Which was good. Because Holly had the exact same effect on 
her. Sharon&#39;s fingers struggled to pull the article down with one hand 
alone. So she (reluctantly) abandoned their kiss and brought her other 
hand up Holly&#39;s skirt. She yanked the damp pink panties straight down 
till they hung at her knees. 

Holly spoke with lusty delight, &quot;I want you, Sharon.&quot;

Well she didn&#39;t have to wait long. The Sacramento-girl brought her 
middle and index fingers to the moist labial region, poised for entry 
into the ever-so-willing vagina. And a hard gasp left Holly&#39;s lips as 
those fleshy pink vaginal walls were parted in one slick thrust. Her 
hips jerked upwards at that second. And Holly exhaled vocally. Something 
Sharon also liked. Hearing Holly-Raine&#39;s moans and cries of pleasure. 
Feeling her jerks and writhing. Watching Holly dance upon her fingers 
for that amazing release. And so Sharon began her skilled thrusting. 
Slowly at first, moving in small, delicate strides. Then the tempo 
slowly increased over time. Dragging her fingers out to the first joint 
then down to the knuckles. Embedding and ejecting. Withdrawing and 
advancing. All the while, those two fingers became coated with glossy 
wetness, allowing for effortless motion. Soon Sharon&#39;s hand began 
thrusting in time with Holly&#39;s quick, shallow breaths. The skewered teen 
gripped the smooth leather of Sharon&#39;s jacket and held on tightly. While 
her throat gave out moan after moan, each time Sharon drove those long 
fingers inside her, up to their hilt. Sharon leaned in and kissed the 
delicate milky skin at Holly-Raine&#39;s neck whilst she did this, feeding 
herself off her lover&#39;s cries and her own zeal. 

But she didn&#39;t last long. 

Holly&#39;s eyes slammed shut and her mouth was wide open. She released one 
final cry. And her thighs clamped around Sharon&#39;s hand, leaving two of 
its fingers trapped deep inside her. The gush of Holly&#39;s sexual fluids 
ran down it, slithering along the outline of knuckles. Holly then bit 
her lip and stifled her gentler moans, weathering down the ecstasy of 
her quick but powerful orgasm. With a satisfied smile of her own, Sharon 
leaned against Holly&#39;s ear and spoke quietly, whispering sweet nothings. 
Holly remained with a sated and replete expression. It was the beginning 
of something. She didn&#39;t know what, but... something. The two were just 
so caught up with each other. And yet this was only the beginning. 

Yeah, life was good. 

**********

&quot;This is a nice place.&quot;

The day had gone by quickly. After a brief moment together at the ice 
cream parlour, Cassie and Alyshia left for home. But of course, they 
stopped at a couple other shops before hand. It was mostly Alyshia&#39;s 
ploy to prevent Cassie from going home too soon. If she took Cassie home 
then chances were she&#39;d have to leave right off the bat. Which would 
leave Cassie all on her own to deal with this. And the taller girl 
didn&#39;t think that the shorter one should have been left alone in this 
situation. But eventually even Alyshia knew that she couldn&#39;t prolong 
the inevitable for too long. They hopped on the first bus that&#39;d take 
them to Cassie&#39;s street of residence. The drive there was mostly taken 
in silence. Every so often, Alyshia would turn to her friend and peer 
with soft looks at her. But Cassie still just stared off into the moving 
distance of the window. Eyes blank. Mouth closed. Her cheek pressed 
against her palm. There was very little in the way of emotional silence 
coming from her now. Cassie had sunk into a kind of desolate stillness. 
It was unnerving. And worrying. By the time they reached their stop, 
Cassie&#39;s home street, it was about 2.30 in the afternoon. School would 
be over in around an hour&#39;s time. Eventually they&#39;d have to go back and 
explain why they missed a whole day&#39;s worth of school... but things like 
that would have to wait till tomorrow to be answered. 

When they got off at that particular street (which Alyshia had committed 
to memory well since she lived not too far away)  they made a short walk 
for Cassie&#39;s home. A quiet semi-detached in an equally quiet area. This 
was where they were now. The second that Cassie got indoors she charged 
up to her room and began stripping out of the clothes she had been 
wearing. Soon she was wearing something far more familiar to her, a 
flower print pink dress that she wore around the house from time to 
time. Through that period, Alyshia made herself respectfully quiet and 
took a seat on one of the two sofas in Cassie&#39;s lounge. Once Cassie came 
back downstairs, she started looking more like her old self. Namely the 
dress code. Her face still looked as pretty as she had made for herself 
today. But wearing her old clothes gave her a deep look of honesty to go 
with it. 

Cassie strode into the living room as she was, then sat down on the 
opposing couch to that of Alyshia&#39;s. But said nothing. And when the 
silence between the two of them became almost unbearable for Alyshia, 
she spoke,

&quot;...Look, do you want me to leave?&quot;

The shorter blonde cast a gaze over at her friend and shook her head for 
a no. And Alyshia breathed a sigh of relief. She didn&#39;t want to leave 
but she was prepared to do so if Cassie REALLY wanted to be alone right 
now. Though it just didn&#39;t seem advisable. So Alyshia turned to 
conversation again.

&quot;So... when does your dad get back from work?&quot;

&quot;Around 9.00.&quot;

&quot;And,&quot; Alyshia figured if she wanted to get Cassie talking again then 
she&#39;d need to stop asking brief questions, &quot;...what does he do? I don&#39;t 
think you ever told me.&quot;

Cassie looked off to the blank TV screen across the room. &quot;He&#39;s a 
mechanic. At a garage downtown. He runs it with his partner... but I 
can&#39;t remember his name.&quot;

Well that was a little better. Finally Cassie was starting to say more 
than five syllables. And Alyshia was just about to ask something more 
when she adjusted her seat. And felt that she was sitting on something. 
Something that she didn&#39;t notice before. The girl shifted to one side of 
the couch and picked up whatever it was. It happened to be something of 
Cassie&#39;s (though Alyshia didn&#39;t immediately notice that). Her poetry 
diary. It was covered with love hearts that had the phrase &#39;Cassie 4 
Holly&#39; written inside of them. Through nothing but spontaneous action, 
Alyshia opened the book. Not to intrude, but, just out of a knee-jerk 
reaction to the situation. And soon she was reading one of the many 
hundreds of little poems and short stories that had been written by 
Cassie herself. The heartbroken blonde didn&#39;t notice this at first. 
Until she looked over at Alyshia and saw her reading her poetry diary... 
which was devoted solely to Holly-Raine. 

Cassie&#39;s sapphire eyes widened with alarm. &quot;Wait... that&#39;s...&quot;

When she heard the panic in Cassie&#39;s voice, Alyshia looked up from the 
book. But then her expression was stunned. Very much so. The 
braided-haired blonde looked over at the author of the book in total 
surprise, blinking vividly. &quot;Cassie... this is beautiful...&quot;

&quot;...I doubt it,&quot; She didn&#39;t think that much of her poems, just the woman 
behind them, &quot;Miss Blake said the same thing when I handed one... into 
her. But I get the feeling... she was just being polite.&quot;

Alyshia closed the book. &quot;...I can&#39;t believe how much... you felt for 
that girl...&quot;

&quot;Her name is Holly-Raine,&quot; Cassie replied, almost irritably, &quot;...And... 
my poems really aren&#39;t anything special. I just... sometimes I got... 
anxious, I guess. I had so much to say to her... and... I didn&#39;t have 
the courage... so... I just... wrote down what I felt. It&#39;s stupid.&quot;

And Alyshia just couldn&#39;t understand Cassie&#39;s negativity about her own 
work. Or why Cassie sacrificed so much affection towards someone who (in 
her own opinion) was so undeserving of it. &quot;They&#39;re really wonderful 
Cassie. You shouldn&#39;t sell yourself short. Not when you have a real 
talent for something.&quot;

It was obvious that the two would never agree on the issue. But it was 
nice to hear fond words about her poetry diary. It was something that 
had been Cassie&#39;s only method of tension release when her feelings grew 
harder to ignore. And it was then that Alyshia waved the book at her 
humble friend with a pleasant smile. &quot;Wanna read me one?&quot;

To anyone else it might not have seemed like a good idea. And in a 
different time and period, Alyshia herself might have agreed with them. 
But she was caught up in Cassie. In just these short few moments she had 
realized how intense and passionate the girl could be. About love and 
her feelings of it, her feelings towards it, and her views about those 
effected by it. Though she had no idea how much Cassie&#39;s personality was 
touching her, Alyshia wanted to know more about her. To amerce herself 
inside the hidden well of ardour that existed inside of her modest 
little friend. 

Cassie herself didn&#39;t understand why she did agreed to it at that point, 
but she did, perhaps with the intention getting the poetry issue out of 
the way. The young woman stood off her couch and walked to the other 
one, taking a seat next to Alyshia. Then she took her poetry diary, 
opened it, and began a small, private recital. It was nothing very flash 
in the least. Cassie simply turned to the first page of her book started 
reading. While Alyshia looked on, almost in a trance. She was hooked on 
what she was both listening to and looking at.  And while Cassie&#39;s 
reading of her poems started off in a mechanical, dispassionate pace... 
with a glaring lack of vitality... her emotions began to bubble as she 
read on. Cassie could recall each day on which she wrote them. And how 
she felt at that point in time. The poems were so full of love, a love 
that existed behind a locked door. Unable to open. Until now. Memories 
of Holly-Raine and what Cassie felt for her were now returning in a 
great inundation. And a solitary tear slipped from her eye when those 
feelings finally began to overwhelm Cassie.

But, at that point...

...Alyshia couldn&#39;t imagine a woman looking any more beautiful.

To naturally express love like that... to be self-effacing and diffident 
about the talent she had for that expression... it was almost 
unbelievable. As great as Cassie looked right now, she possessed 
something that most people do; but never at the same calibre. It was 
called &#39;Inner Beauty&#39;. It wasn&#39;t fake, it wasn&#39;t staged, it wasn&#39;t 
narcissistic.  It was quite frankly the most alluring trait that Alyshia 
had seen in a woman in all her life. And as fate would have it, Alyshia 
could not stop herself from acting on the emotions that Cassie had 
stirred within her.  

Then there was a brief but dramatic surge of momentum. 

When Cassie stopped reading for one second to turn the page of her 
poetry diary, the heat of desperate lips were soon pressed against her 
own. Cassie&#39;s eyes widened and her heart leapt up in beat from nothing 
more than pure shock. And it took a good few seconds for her mindset to 
fully register what was going on. Alyshia was kissing her. In every 
sense of the word, Alyshia was kissing her. And they remained that way 
until the Alyshia pulled back and sighed, running a blonde braid out of 
her face and behind her ear. A stunned woman looked back at a 
surprisingly anxious one, in a short lived silence.

Which was broken shortly thereafter. &quot;...I&#39;m sorry... I shouldn&#39;t have 
done that... but... you were just reading those poems and... I dunno... 
I guess I just couldn&#39;t hold it back anymore.&quot;

&quot;...Hold it back...?&quot; Cassie said in a questioning tone. 

&quot;...Cassie...&quot; Alyshia leaned back on the couch, &quot;...I... like you. I 
really like you. Pretty much since I first saw you. Even back then. Then 
when... Shannon did what she did at Summer&#39;s party, I saw how much it 
hurt you. I had to talk to you. To make sure you were okay. And since 
we&#39;ve been friends... I&#39;ve really enjoyed spending time with you. But 
when you started reading... those wonderful feelings... I sort of got 
caught up in all of it. In you, I mean. Damn, this isn&#39;t coming out 
right...&quot;

Cassie was still shocked silent. That kiss was not an accident (...which 
was kind of obvious anyway) Alyshia really did hold... something for 
her. Why couldn&#39;t Holly have felt like that about her? It seemed like 
such a cruel turnabout. For both Cassie and for Alyshia. But then, a 
little something else occurred to Cassie. Throughout the day, Alyshia 
had been there for her. Even though Cassie had been (and quite frankly, 
still was) upset about Holly-Raine. How strong of a person did that make 
her? To stand by firmly and comfort the one you cared about when she was 
broken-hearted over someone else. Alyshia had actually done that. Cassie 
stared softly at the other girl. Alyshia seemed nervous somehow, as if 
Cassie were about to drop the executioner&#39;s axe anytime now. Cassie had 
to do something to assure Alyshia that she wasn&#39;t... unhappy about this. 
But what could she really say? Holly had knocked Cassie right off cloud 
nine today. How could she say anything to Alyshia that wouldn&#39;t result 
in the same outcome? And more importantly, what would it do to their 
friendship if Cassie actually were to do that? This seemed like a no win 
situation. But when Alyshia realized that Cassie was having trouble in 
coming to decision about how to act next, she spoke first instead.

Her words however, were a plea for her case. &quot;Cassie... look... it&#39;s 
kind of selfish of me to be springing this on you... right now. And, I 
know how you feel about that Holly-Raine girl and... I just wanna say 
that... I could make you happy. Just as much as she would. Maybe more. 
If... you&#39;re ready to give me the chance.&quot;

Again this made for a tough decision. More so than ever before. Alyshia 
was really putting herself out on a limb here. And Cassie couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to shatter those emotions. How could she after what happened 
with Holly? But at the same time... was it really fair on either of them 
to venture down this road? It wasn&#39;t like Cassie could just bring 
herself to forget all her feelings toward Holly in a couple of days 
time. What if she NEVER got over Holly? Would Alyshia really wait for 
her when that was a possibility? And what would it mean for their 
friendship? If Cassie agreed to this and it ended up not working out... 
they probably couldn&#39;t stay friends. They&#39;d lose each other totally. And 
Cassie didn&#39;t have so many friends that she could risk losing them. It 
was such a tough decision for her. Nevertheless. Right now Cassie was at 
her lowest. Even if it all ended horribly, even if it cost her a friend, 
at this moment in time, she felt like she needed the warmth of another. 
Someone to lean on. Someone to just... be with. And here was kind 
Alyshia, so ready and willing to give her that warmth. That shoulder to 
drape herself on. 

...What was the right choice?

...What was the fair one?

Questions that Cassie, it seems, did not have the answer to. 

&quot;...Well...?&quot; Alyshia prodded, &quot;...can you give me an answer...?&quot;

She could. It came with stipulations that, for now, remained unspoken. 
But they could just save that for later. Cassie breathed out slowly then 
shifted herself over to Alyshia. Taking her time, raising her hand 
slowly to Alyshia&#39;s baby soft cheek.

And Cassie&#39;s lips parted with speech. &quot;...Alyshia, I...&quot;

**********

Chris Angel says,

* And there you have it. The last chapter of the Misadventures of 
Holly-Raine. Riddled with plenty of unresolved issues to keep you all 
guessing. Will Cassie allow herself to be with Alyshia? And if so, just 
what&#39;ll it do to their friendship? How long can Holly-Raine and Sharon 
stay an item with that &#39;roaming eye&#39; of Holly&#39;s? What of Summer&#39;s 
apparent jealousy? Will Shannon ever get her comeuppance? I guess those 
questions give you guys all the more reason to read the Misadventures of 
Kandi, huh?

* I tried REALLY hard not to have Holly come off as a bitch in this 
chapter. I get the feeling that I didn&#39;t succeed. Dah well. 

* I think I introduced two new characters into this chapter, Chloe James 
and Michelle Moore. They&#39;ll have far bigger roles in the Misadventures 
of Kandi, I assure you. And there was little in the way of sex this 
chapter, but M. O. K will make up for it.
