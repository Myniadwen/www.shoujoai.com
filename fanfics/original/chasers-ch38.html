<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/chasers-ch37.html">Back to Part 37</a><pre>Beth Harris smiled as she worked away in the computer
center, the little redhead dressed in a conservative
blouse and skirt. The reactions of her fellows, who
were used to seeing the little redhead dressed in
everything from micro mini-skirts to lingerie, were
just priceless.

&quot;Did you finally wear something so outrageous that
Gwen had to have a talk with you?&quot; Kate Williams had
to ask Beth, the lanky brown haired woman looking her
over curiously, taking in the happy glow around the
younger woman.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Beth looked up at Kate, her green eyes
sparkling. &quot;No,&quot; she shook her head firmly,
&quot;everything&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;So why wear the corporate drag?&quot; Kate sounded
exasperated. Then again, she rarely if ever deviated
from jeans, T-shirt and a battered police jacket, so
it was probably understandable she was a little
confused by Beth&#39;s change.

Beth chuckled, &quot;If it helps any, I need to go over to
the regular police services today and try to patch the
holes in their security.&quot;

Kate studied Beth a moment, then the taller woman
smiled suddenly. &quot;Something happened, didn&#39;t it?&quot; she
asked directly.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Beth replied unconvincingly as she
blushed faintly.

Kate just smirked, &quot;I&#39;ll find out eventually.&quot; Giving
Beth a casual wave she headed up the hall to her
little office.

Beth sighed to herself softly. Jennifer had been in
earlier and had been even more merciless, if that was
possible, and in such a good-natured sort of way it
was hard to resist. She knew that Gwen wouldn&#39;t mind
her telling the others that they were dating, but
still....

&quot;Good morning, Beth,&quot; Gwen Musashi strolled down the
hall, the elegant Asian looking as lovely as ever
dressed in one of her fine suits.

&quot;Gwen,&quot; Beth smiled, meeting those surprisingly gentle
eyes. &quot;Hope you&#39;re feeling all right this morning,&quot;
she continued.

Gwen paused by the computer, reaching out to set a
hand on Beth&#39;s arm. &quot;I&#39;m more than all right,&quot; was the
quiet answer.

&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Beth smirked.

Gwen chuckled softly. &quot;So how long do I have to lend
you to the regular police services?&quot; she asked
curiously.

&quot;Most of today, I&#39;m afraid,&quot; Beth conceded. &quot;I need to
get a overview of the system first, then I&#39;ll start
problem solving,&quot; she explained.

&quot;I&#39;m a fair to good programmer myself,&quot; Gwen added,
careful about something that was normally Beth&#39;s
territory, &quot;if I can help, I&#39;d like to.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Beth grinned.

Jen watched the two together, then as silently as
possible turned away from the doorway and back along
the office lined hallway. She tapped at Kate&#39;s door,
&quot;You in?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, come on,&quot; Kate answered.

&quot;Did you see Gwen and Beth this morning?&quot; Jen asked
her curiously, smoothly sitting in the chair on the
other side of the woman&#39;s desk.

&quot;Yeah, why?&quot; Kate said absent mindedly, running
through her computer screen with a faint frown.
Despite a disorganized appearance she really was good
at this sort of thing, even though she also clearly
disliked the paperwork their job required.

&quot;So what&#39;s going on between them?&quot; she asked, feeling
a bit exasperated at Kate&#39;s firm refusal to be led
into gossiping.

&quot;They went out last night,&quot; Kate shrugged as if that
explained it all. She frowned as she sorted files,
shifting anything that was inactive to the storage
archives.

Jen&#39;e eyes widened slightly, &quot;But I thought that was
just a business diner.&quot;

Kate gave Jen a thoughtful look, making the younger
woman squirm slightly. &quot;You&#39;re a good officer,&quot; she
finally said, &quot;but I see we&#39;ll have a ways to go
before you&#39;re a detective.&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Jen protested.

&quot;I&#39;m going to explain this really simply,&quot; Kate took a
pen and pointed it at Jen for emphasis, &quot;Beth has been
creaming her panties for Gwen for almost as long as
I&#39;ve known her.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Jen looked at her in confusion, &quot;Beth has
been dating around for months!&quot;

Kate quoted, &quot;If you can&#39;t be with the one you love,
love the one you&#39;re with.&quot;

Jen looked at her blankly, &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;People just don&#39;t get the references,&quot; Kate shook her
head. She smiled grimly, &quot;If Beth was sure she didn&#39;t
have a chance, of course she&#39;d date around.&quot;

&quot;Beth and Gwen,&quot; Jen shook her head, &quot;I have a very
hard time imagining that.&quot;

Kate actually smirked, &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know....&quot;

Jen rolled her eyes, &quot;You scare me occasionally.&quot; She
leaned forward, &quot;So what&#39;s on the job list for today?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re both on call for emergencies, of course,&quot; Kate
casually called up the office bulletin board as she
read, &quot;the rogue Recon androids are still a priority,
as is the android flasher case in the business
district.&quot;

&quot;Flasher?&quot; Jen found herself smiling slightly.

&quot;A waitress droid who wandered away from work,&quot; Kate
explained, &quot;she&#39;s lost at least some of her uniform
and is offering &#39;Coffee, tea or me?&#39; regularly.&quot; She
drummed her fingers on the console, &quot;It may be a
tampering case, so we&#39;ll need to bring the android
here intact.&quot;


&quot;It almost sounds like someone&#39;s idea of a prank,&quot; Jen
thoughtfully noted only to freeze under Kate&#39;s
ice-cold glare.

In clipped tones Kate said, &quot;Most of those waitress
droids have a hard enough time without customers
tampering with their software.&quot;

Jen looked at Kate oddly a moment, wondering where
this unexpected degree of compassion was coming from.
Suddenly a light dawned, &quot;Friend of Silver&#39;s?&quot;

A bit of a blush colored Kate&#39;s tanned cheeks, &quot;Well,
yes. I met Jamie the last time I was in Lowtown
visiting her.&quot;

Jen smiled slightly, studying the other woman&#39;s almost
charming blush. &quot;Are you and Silver seeing each
other?&quot; the question popped out almost against Jen&#39;s
will.

&quot;No,&quot; Kate answered her frankly, &quot;we&#39;re friends.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Jen said faintly.

&quot;Not your fault,&quot; Kate shook her head. She smiled
grimly, &quot;There are times you almost sound like that
damn headshrinker they have me seeing.&quot;

&quot;Rough?&quot; Jen asked gently.

&quot;More like relentless,&quot; Kate smiled wryly, &quot;she seems
determined to peel back my psyche and tinker with me.&quot;

&quot;She can&#39;t be that bad,&quot; Jen said with a smile, amused
to see such a look on her face.

&quot;Oh yes she is,&quot; Kate answered. She shook her head,
&quot;Remember Grasshopper, Gwen is the one who sicked her
on me.&quot;

&quot;Grasshopper?&quot; Jen blinked, &quot;Another one of your
historic references, right?&quot;

&quot;One of these days I&#39;m going to lend you my
data-cubes,&quot; Kate said with a sigh, &quot;if only so that
you&#39;ll understand my jokes.&quot;

Jen got up, stretching slightly as she headed to the
door. &quot;Or it could be,&quot; she shot back over her
shoulder, &quot;that you&#39;re just not that funny.&quot;

&quot;A hit!&quot; Kate cried dramatically even as a chuckling
Jen left.</pre>
