<a href="../original/bloodsex-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>Jess Drake noted the name on the door and smiled
slightly, &#39;Guess this is it.&#39; A bell rang out as she
went into what amounted as a reception room,
unattended at that time. &#39;Well that&#39;s careless,&#39; she
thought, nearly tempted to play with the computer on
the desk.

Just the a young man came out of the next room,
hurrying to the desk as he tried to put his best
&#39;professional&#39; face on. &quot;Welcome to Yamazaki
Investigations, how can I....&quot; he trailed off in
surprise, gaping at her.

&#39;Surprised &#39;em, good,&#39; Jess fought back a grin,
realizing that she had spotted their tails without
tipping them off. &quot;I understand you&#39;ve been asking
about me?&quot; Jess Drake asked him casually, standing
there dressed in her usual jeans and t-shirt.

&quot;Uh, boss?&quot; Tom called out worriedly.

In a moment a lovely Asian woman and a brown haired
girl strode out off the inner office to reinforce him,
even as Jess looked them over thoughtfully. &quot;So,&quot; Jess
asked them all coldly, &quot;why were you following me?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the Asian woman said calmly, &quot;I can&#39;t
name my client.&quot;

Jess smiled slightly, studying the three nervous
figures standing there, &quot;Why did I know you were going
to say that?&quot;

&quot;My name is Lucy Yamasaki,&quot; the Asian woman bowed just
slightly, &quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t be willing to answer
some questions?&quot;

&quot;Boss!&quot; the brown haired woman blurted out worriedly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Rose.&quot; Lucy kept her eyes firmly
fixed on Jess as she said, &quot;she plays by the rules,
mostly.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s done her research,&#39; Jess thought. A dangerous
smile teased her lips as she purred, &quot;It&#39;s the mostly
that you need to concentrate on.&quot;

Rose moved fast, smoothly pushing Lucy back as she
bared her teeth at Jess, &quot;Don&#39;t you dare threaten
her!&quot;

Jess blinked at seeing the unique mystic aura that
suddenly crackled to life around the younger woman, &#39;A
werewolf?&#39; Keeping her voice calm she said, &quot;Down,
puppy.&quot; A flashed smile, &quot;I&#39;d hate to have to neuter
you.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t even think about it,&quot; Tom said firmly, his hand
carefully moving towards a ominous bulge under his
jacket.

&quot;Break it up,&quot; Lucy barked, putting herself between
Jess and her two associates. She glared at the two of
them, &quot;You two did the research on Drake, you should
know better.&quot;

&quot;Yes boss,&quot; both chimed in after a moment, looking
remarkably sheepish.

Lucy looked at Jess then she gestured towards her
office and asked, &quot;Would you care to talk about this
privately?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Jess kept her voice mild. &#39;Sounds like
they&#39;ve bought into my reputation,&#39; she thought,
reflecting on the two investigators outside.

Lucy sat behind her desk even as she waved Jess over
to a seat, &quot;As I said before, I cannot name my client.
However, I can assure you that the investigation was
prompted by a personal matter, not by a rival or
business matter.&quot;

&#39;Well that&#39;s something,&#39; Jess thought. She could guess
at a few possibilities who could have hired Yamazaki,
one of which made her feel distinctly uncomfortable.
Just the idea that Alice might have asked for a
investigator to look into her background made Jess
squirm, especially considering the lack of faith that
represented.

&quot;I suppose you wouldn&#39;t be willing to answer a few
questions and make my job easier?&quot; Lucy quirked an
eyebrow.

&quot;I&#39;ll answer,&quot; Jess said mildly, &quot;I can&#39;t promise that
my answers will help much.&quot;

Lucy took a moment to collect her thoughts, then she
asked, &quot;Why is it my people can&#39;t find anything on you
before you came to the city a few years back?&quot;

&quot;Been having a rough time?&quot; Jess asked, her eyes
faintly amused. She relented a bit, &quot;Check the
obituaries.&quot;

Lucy opened her mouth to say something, then shook
herself as she made fast note on a sheet of paper
nearby. &quot;If you are legally dead,&quot; she studied Jess,
&quot;how are you able to manage? You own a business, the
licenses...?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not all that hard,&quot; Jess said with some
amusement in her voice, &quot;especially when dealing with
bureaucracies.&quot; Deciding that she&#39;d given these
investigators enough of a hint Jess got up, stretching
as she said, &quot;One other thing.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot; Lucy looked up with interest.

&quot;I did some looking into Yamazaki Investigations and
you,&quot; Jess said quietly, &quot;turnabout is fair play,
after all.&quot; She smiled at seeing the nervousness
appear in her eyes and continued, &quot;You tend to play in
the gray areas, and I know all about some of the...
more dubious business ventures that you&#39;re involved
in.&quot;

&quot;None of which are illegal,&quot; Lucy said flatly.

&quot;But which could do a lot of damage to your reputation
if they came out,&quot; Jess countered as she walked over
to the door. Taking the door handle in hand she warned
with a smile, &quot;If you hurt anyone connected to me,
I&#39;ll have to take steps.&quot;

&quot;Understood,&quot; Lucy&#39;s voice was frosty as Jess left the
room.

Jess strode into the outer office, noticing both Tom
and Rose hanging about the door. She smiled faintly,
looking at Rose thoughtfully as she said, &quot;By the way,
I noticed a shadow the last couple of nights.&quot; Her
voice dropped to a deadly purr as she warned, &quot;If I
catch you following me again, I&#39;ll cut your tail off.&quot;
Striding by them she was out in the hall in a moment
and Jess paused for a second, listening.

&quot;Do you think she&#39;ll do it?&quot; Tom squeaked.

&quot;Hell yes,&quot; Rose whimpered.

Jess grinned, heading out into the street. It was
times like this, after dealing with a stressful moment
that she wanted to have either a drink or a smoke, but
she knew both of them were a bad idea. She walked over
to the waiting yellow taxi and climbed in the battered
car as she smiled over at the driver, &quot;Just in time.&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t I always?&quot; the saucy redhead said with a grin
from the driver&#39;s seat, turning the key to start up
the engine.

&quot;Thanks Amy,&quot; Jess sat back with a sigh, letting
herself finally relax. &quot;Can you take me back to the
shop?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; she pulled out into traffic and away from
the office building as she said, &quot;and it&#39;s Amaterasu,
remember?&quot;

Jess rolled her eyes, &quot;Amaterasu is a lot harder to
say than Amy.&quot;

&quot;Names describe both form and function,&quot; Amaterasu
said mildly as she expertly drove them across the bad
side of town, &quot;as you should well know by now, miko.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Jess studied her thoughtfully. &quot;You know, you
were introduced to me by Diana and Circe over at the
Daughters,&quot; she mused, &quot;and it occurs to me that it
may not be a coincidence that you&#39;re named after a
Japanese sun deity.&quot;

Amaterasu just looked amused, &quot;I take the Fifth.&quot;

&quot;I could have guessed,&quot; Jess rolled her eyes. &#39;I
wonder how many forgotten deities live among us,&#39; she
thought wryly, &#39;humanity entirely unaware? Of course I
never realized either, until Diana and friends
revealed themselves.&#39;

&quot;Are you going over to the Daughters later,&quot; Amaterasu
asked, weaving through traffic and eventually reaching
the tattoo parlor, &quot;or maybe over to Sisterhood
Books?&quot;

&quot;Does everyone at the bar know about Alice and I?&quot;
Jess asked with a sigh, rolling her eyes as they
finally parked.

&quot;I think the word&#39;s gone around,&quot; Amaterasu admitted
as she put the brake on, &quot;you did have your fight in
the middle of the bar.&quot;

&quot;Gah,&quot; Jess made a face as she fished around in her
wallet for some bills, &quot;I hate being the topic of
rumors.&quot;

&quot;Considering your rep,&quot; Amaterasu said while she
calmly counted out change, &quot;I&#39;d think you&#39;d be used to
it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s all related to my work,&quot; Jess answered her
quietly as she got out of the taxi, &quot;it&#39;s never been
over anything personal.&quot;

&quot;Guess so,&quot; Amaterasu acknowledged. She smiled,
&quot;Either way, good luck!&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Jess waved as she pulled out, then walked
over to the tattoo parlor.</pre>
