<h1>Chasers 2075 (part 33 of 48)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/chasers-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><pre>&quot;Please,&quot; she reached out, gently putting her hand on
his bare arm as she plead, &quot;can&#39;t you stay just a
little longer?&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; he pulled away reluctantly, his bare
chest dark with hair, &quot;but I have to catch the jet in
a few hours, m&#39;love.&quot;

&quot;But,&quot; she started, then the cellphone rang....

Kate Williams smiled slightly as she sat back in the
battered office chair, reading what she had just
written. Writing historical fiction was an odd hobby,
even she&#39;d admit it, but doing something so peaceful
was oddly satisfying to her. The rangy, brown haired
woman closed the file she was working on, feeling a
moment of satisfaction at no annoying computer voices.

Where Beth had found this antique Kate didn&#39;t know but
the old computer was a godsend to her. Manufactured
just before the big vocal-interactive boom, it was
modern enough to communicate with other systems but
lacked the annoying personality of modern models. It
wasn&#39;t much more than a glorified typewriter, but it
suited her fine.

&#39;Wonder if I should call Silver?&#39; Kate thought as she
got up, stretching stiff muscles. She and the android
were developing a gentle friendship, but they were
still feeling out the boundaries. &#39;No,&#39; Kate thought
of the night they had spent together, &#39;it&#39;s still too
soon.&#39;

Looking at her calendar display Kate groaned softly.
&quot;Another session with that damn headshrinker,&quot; she
muttered, heading into the kitchen. In all honesty she
didn&#39;t mind the therapy sessions as much as she had
expected, but it still annoyed her that she had to go.
Pressing a key on her badly battered answering machine
she smiled as the tape loudly rewound and began to
haltingly play messages from the past few days.

Sqwark... a moment&#39;s silence then, &quot;This is Doctor
Jameson&#39;s office, you&#39;re next appointment is for
Tuesday, March seventh...&quot;

Kate bypassed that with a sigh, &quot;I know, I know!&quot;

Qwrp... then Gwen&#39;s voice, &quot;I&#39;m not going to be
available tonight, personal business, so please keep
your pager and com. available.&quot; A moment&#39;s pause and
she added irritably, &quot;And would you get a modern
answering system, please?!&quot;

Kate just had to chuckle at that. Her antique
answering machine annoyed Gwen to no end, in all
honestly that was part of why she kept it. &#39;Personal
business,&#39; Kate thought wryly, &#39;yeah, a little piece
of business named Beth.&#39;

Zzzrk... &quot;Is this thing working? Kate, this is Naru,
could you please return my call? All I want to do is
talk...&quot;

Kate stopped the tape to rewind it, listening again to
the voice. &#39;Wonder why my dear cousin is trying to
contact me again?&#39; she wondered. She had only found
out about Naru and the other branch of the family a
few years ago, and had been avoiding them ever since.

Bdip... &quot;Would it violate your no dating rule if we
just went out for some coffee?&quot; Jen&#39;s voice asked
evenly. &quot;Call me at home if you&#39;re interested.&quot;

&quot;The girl just doesn&#39;t know when to quit,&quot; Kate said
with admiration. Jen had been pretty dogged in forming
a non-professional relationship with her, despite
Kate&#39;s own firm resistance. The beautiful blonde was a
good kid, probably part of why she was resisting. &#39;I
don&#39;t want to be hurt again,&#39; she thought honestly,
&#39;or to hurt her.&#39;

&quot;Incoming call,&quot; the phone announced in a annoyingly
chirpy voice, violently interrupting Kate&#39;s thoughts.
She glared down at the modern phone that Beth had
jury-rigged an attachment to the older answering
machine and again wished that she could just get rid
of it. Sadly an older model couldn&#39;t interface with
the phone system, leaving her stuck with this.
&quot;Incoming call,&quot; it repeated in that relentlessly
chirpy voice.

&quot;Receive, damn it,&quot; Kate growled, silently vowing that
one of these days she&#39;d get the schematics for the
phone and tear that vocal mono-chip right out. Then
she heard the voice and knew that she really shouldn&#39;t
have picked up.

&quot;Is this Kate Williams?&quot; Naru&#39;s voice asked softly,
sounding tentative.

Kate bit back a curse at hearing her voice. &quot;Yeah,&quot;
she answered her grimly, &quot;so what do you want,
cousin?&quot;

Naru sighed softly. &quot;I know you told the private
investigator that you didn&#39;t want us making contact
with you,&quot; she answered, &quot;but I can&#39;t believe....&quot;

&quot;You probably should,&quot; Kate cut her off firmly, just
wishing that this little problem wouldn&#39;t keep on
coming up.

From what Kate had been able to piece together on her
own, Naru&#39;s side of the family had only become aware
of her existence a few years ago. In a city with a
population in the millions it had been difficult for
them to find her, so they had contracted with a
investigator to do it. Once he reached her he provided
the information on her family and asked if she had a
message to pass on.

&#39;Of course, they didn&#39;t expect to hear that I didn&#39;t
want anything to do with the family,&#39; Kate thought
grimly, &#39;and Naru definitely hasn&#39;t accepted it.&#39;

Naru puffed out a breath and muttered under her
breath, &quot;And this seemed like such a good idea at the
time.&quot; More loudly she continued, &quot;I&#39;m at a market in
your building that&#39;s just a few levels from your
suite.&quot; Discretely she didn&#39;t mention the market was
above Kate&#39;s unit then continued on, &quot;I&#39;d like to talk
to you, if I could.&quot;

&#39;And she&#39;s near enough to me to show up on my doorstep
if I say no,&#39; Kate thought irritably. Holding her
temper back she answered, &quot;There&#39;s a bar there,
O&#39;Connell&#39;s. I&#39;ll be down in five.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Naru started before Kate hung up on her.

Thinking very unpleasant thoughts Kate grabbed her
jacket and headed to the front door, slipping on her
shoes before stepping out into the hall. &quot;Good
evening, Ms. Williams,&quot; the elevator greeted her
cheerfully as she stepped inside.

&quot;Shut up,&quot; Kate growled.

Once she got off, the elevator waited until she had
taken a few steps down the hall before responding,
&quot;Have a nice day.&quot;

Kate grit her teeth but just kept going. The market
level was as busy as ever, artificial white light
adding to the twilight glow that a inhabitant on this
level normally got used to. The savory scent of
cooking food hung in the air from all the restaurants
while stands sold everything from fresh vegetables to
frozen fish. There were even a few daring to sell the
delicacy of red meat, though they did so with the
utmost caution.

Moving through the crowds Kate nodded her greetings to
those she knew and ignored any protests from those she
had to bump aside. In this city the Markets were held
open twenty-four hours a day to better serve the
people who worked wildly different shifts throughout
the levels of the city.

O&#39;Connell&#39;s was actually run by a member of the
O&#39;Connell family, as older man named Tamsin. It wasn&#39;t
an traditional Irish bar, it really was more of a
dive, but it served good beer and all of the snacks
were free. Tamsin had an eye for trouble and at first
had been worried about having Kate there, but finally
had warmed to her once she admitted to him she was a
cop.

&quot;Kate,&quot; a woman&#39;s voice called and Kate set eyes on
her cousin.

The black hair flowed down her back in a wave as Naru
stood up in one of the booths, her slim body sheathed
in the latest fashion. Her jewelry wasn&#39;t too ornate,
just earrings and a simple necklace, while her face
was subtly touched by makeup. Her face was grave,
maybe even a bit worried, but her blue eyes were
gentle.

&#39;Wonder if she dressed up for this,&#39; Kate thought as
she walked over in battered jacket, pants and a clean
shirt, &#39;or if this is her usual style?&#39; There was a
familiarity about her, one she had a hard time placing
until she realized Naru looked just a little like her.

&quot;It&#39;s good to meet you at last,&quot; Naru smiled as she
sat, Kate following suit reluctantly. She looked at
Kate thoughtfully, &quot;The photos the investigator
brought us didn&#39;t really do you justice.&quot;

Kate wasn&#39;t much in the mood to be charmed. &quot;So what
did you want to talk to me about?&quot; she asked Naru
crisply.

&quot;Not much for small talk, are you?&quot; Naru looked more
amused than anything else. &quot;All right, why are you so
resistant to meeting my family?&quot;

&quot;I save small talk for my friends,&quot; Kate said dryly.

&quot;Bringing another date here?&quot; Tamsin asked as he
walked up their booth, his red hair streaked with
gray. He set down Kate&#39;s usual drink in front of her
then set a pint in front of Naru.

&quot;She&#39;s not a date,&quot; Kate scowled at him, &quot;so scram.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Tamsin moved off with a laugh, &quot;she was
sure asking enough questions about you, I figured her
for one of your one night stands.&quot;

&quot;You were asking about me?&quot; Kate raised an eyebrow at
Naru.

&quot;I had to try to get an idea about what sort of person
you are,&quot; Naru answered as she took a drink, a bit
surprised at the quality of the drink. She smiled,
&quot;One of the things he mentioned is that your bark is
worse than your bite.&quot;

&quot;Considering I&#39;ve never bit him he doesn&#39;t know what
he&#39;s talking about,&quot; Kate answered. Getting back to
Naru&#39;s question she said, &quot;I&#39;ve managed just fine
without a family so far, I don&#39;t see much point in
being saddled with one now.&quot;

Naru shook her head tiredly, &quot;We&#39;re not interested in
saddling you with anything, we just want to get to
know you a bit better.&quot;

Kate took a drink of her own dark beer, savoring the
taste. &quot;That&#39;s strange to hear, considering how
strongly you pursued this meeting.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Naru conceded. She reached into her purse to
pull out a card, setting it down on the table, &quot;This
is encoded with my and the family&#39;s numbers, the next
move is yours.&quot;

Before Kate could respond Naru rose, setting down
credit chips on the table before striding out of the
bar. &quot;Now that,&quot; Kate sighed as she finished her beer,
&quot;is style.&quot;</pre>
