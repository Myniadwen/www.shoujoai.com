The moment Debby Lynn Kalter saw those two girls entering the store she 
knew that they were a bad omen. At first glance they appeared to be 
everyday teenagers and yet there was something about them that disturbed 
her immensely. When she caught a glimpse of the tightly bond bandages 
wrapped around the dark haired girl&#39;s wrist she knew they had to be from 
that strange school at the top of the hill, Whispering Hills Academy, 
home to wayward souls. This fact was verified by the blonde, leather 
clad, girl&#39;s vicious glares upon being questioned about where they came 
from. She thought they were reasonable questions, considering they did 
arrive during school hour, and they did not need to be so rude about 
answering. 

Debby had only learned about the existence of the unusual school a few 
month&#39;s earlier, two weeks after starting her new job at the &quot;Corner 
Stop and Drug Shop&quot;. She originally moved to the town of Whispering 
Hills to get away from the darkness that had swallowed her hometown, she 
thought for certain that this place would be different and yet, now, she 
was reconsidering that notion. For the most part the town was as normal 
as small towns came, if you can call a town at the outskirts of the 
Realm of Dreams &quot;Normal&quot;. She thought for sure that she had escaped the 
nightmare of her home, but the presence of those girls gave her an 
unsettling feeling that she was not as safe as she believed, even if it 
was irrational feeling. 

&quot;Debby, are you alright?&quot; One of her coworkers inquired, startling the 
woman out of her thoughts.

Debby rubbed her head, &quot;I think it has just been a long day is all.&quot; She 
explained as she stared down at a broken pickle jar in the middle of an 
aisle and the mop in hand. Her head had been steadily throbbing at an 
increasing rate over the past hour, feeling as if something hit her 
across the head with enough force to rattle her brain within its shell 
and even the slightest of movement was making it worse. She had already 
taken several painkillers, yet nothing seemed to dull the pain. She 
internally cursed those Academy girls as yet another wave of dizziness 
hit her and she needed to hold onto the handle of a cola fridge to 
regain her balance. 

The co-worker quickly moved to her side, &quot;Are you sure you are alright?&quot; 
He inquired lightly.

Debby forced herself to smile as she struggled to stand, &quot;I... I&#39;ll be 
fine.&quot; Markus was a cute and sincere young man of twenty-one, if he was 
not lying about his birthday the week before that is. She had to admit 
that she was glad that he held such concern for her considering they 
barely knew each other. 

&quot;You don&#39;t look fine to me.&quot; He stated bluntly, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go home 
and I&#39;ll finish up here?&quot; He offered as he took the mop from the woman, 
leaning it against a rack of chips before offering Debby a hand. 

Debby gratefully took the hand in hers and allowed herself to be lead to 
the back of the store, &quot;Are you sure you will be alright without me?&quot; 
She inquired worriedly, she did not want to lose her job over something 
as simple as a headache, yet this felt much worse then any headache she 
had ever felt in her life. 

Markus nodded, &quot;I have Vicky working the cash right now and things 
usually die down around supper time so there should be no problems, 
really.&quot; 

Debby grinned thankfully, &quot;That&#39;s very nice of you.&quot; She said as she 
pushed through a pair of swinging doors that lead to the small office 
that served as a lodge for the store&#39;s staff. She retrieved her jacket 
off a line of hooks next to the back door and began to pull it on, &quot;If 
you ever need me for a double shift then you know how to contact me.&quot; 
She offered. 

Markus pushed the heavy metal bar that spanned the back door and held it 
open for his co-worker, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that. Just get some rest 
alright?&quot;

Debby gave Markus a kind, weak, smile, &quot;Thank you Markus.&quot; She stepped 
out the door and into one of the long back alleys that cut through the 
town like veins. 

Markus glanced up at the dark clouds that were brewing overhead, &quot;It 
looks like a storm is on its way so you should hurry on home before it 
rains.&quot; 

&quot;I will.&quot; She took one last look at Markus and gave him a small wave 
good bye, &quot;I&#39;ll see you tomorrow alright?&quot; 

&quot;Just get some rest.&quot; Markus reiterate with a motion for the women to 
get moving, &quot;I&#39;ll call you in the morning to see how you are doing.&quot; 

&quot;Alright.&quot; The air filled with the low grumble of the upcoming storm, 
&quot;Seeya.&quot;  She turned and briskly walked down the long alley towards her 
home. Usually she tried to avoid the alleys as much as possible, she had 
hear a number of rumours of people disappearing in the shadows, however 
with the sun was still fighting its way through the clouds that 
threatened to suffocate it, so she figured she had a few hours of light 
before she needed to worry to much about the shadows coming for her. 

She could not have been more wrong for within minutes darkness swallowed 
the last of the sun&#39;s protective light and fear filled the poor woman&#39;s 
heart as not a single streetlight turned on to guide her way. Before 
long she found herself surrounded by the very shadows that she spent so 
much time running from. Frightfully she stumbled across the alley in 
search of some sight of light. Something darted between her feet causing 
her to trip and pitch forwards into a set of trashcans, sending them 
clattering about the alleyway, the sound of the cans echoed off the 
alley walls with increasing intensity. Debby clapped her hands to her 
ears and cringed with each clatter of sound reverberated. She sat upon 
the ground with her eyes clenched tight, unwilling to move until the 
final sounds diminished, and even then she stayed still as a statue as 
the minutes ticked by, unsure of the creatures that she might have 
stirred after the commotion. 

After a time she allowed one eye to peek around, to still she find 
herself surrounded by blackness. Cautiously she peels back her hands 
from her ears and listened carefully to the air around her. Silence only 
greeted her ears, that and the soft sound of the breeze rushing passed 
her, the wind of an upcoming storm. She could smell the storm on the air 
and this sent electric worry through her. As she strained her ears she 
could feel the hairs on the back of her neck begin to rise, there was 
something else out there other then the appending storm. Her eyes darted 
around the darkness in search of what could be watching her when she saw 
it, a glimmering disk of light only metres away from where she sat. A 
hysterical giggle of glee escaped her lips as she bolted down the alley 
towards the only sign of escape in sight. She was certain that she would 
make it and would be free of this unnerving darkness when she ran into 
something soft and stumbled to the ground yet again, scrapping her knee 
and the palm of her hand on the hard asphalt ground. 

She glanced around in search of where her savour light had gotten too 
when the streetlight above her flickered to life. It was only for a 
brief moment, but in that second of light she saw the face of a man 
staring down at her from the darkness, No not a man, a mask, a pale 
white mask floating high over her, the mask of the Faceless. During 
Debby&#39;s travels through the Realms of Dream she had only encountered 
these creatures once before. Its black cloak, that of shadows, flowed 
behind the mask as it slithered like silk across the ground, its 
porcelain death mask hovering over non-existence shoulders. That first 
time she had been lucky for the creature already had prey it was 
seeking, however this time she knew it was her that those empty eyes 
were watching in the darkness. There was no way she would be getting out 
of alleyway alive and she could feel it in her stomach. She was about to 
give up when her eyes fell upon that circle of light in the distance. It 
could not be over five metres away and that gave her a small glimmer of 
hope to her dismal life. 

Without hesitation she scampered across the alley, on all fours, using 
her hands to push herself to a crutch, as she lunged for the light. She 
felt a slight breeze as something glided swiftly over her head. She 
envisioned the Faceless&#39;s curved claws, as white as its mask and made of 
broken shards of the same porcelain as its pale face, sweeping over her 
head, maybe taking a few strains of her hair. Not willing to turn back 
she pumped her legs with all her might, that circle of light her only 
sanctuary. Her sneakers echoed off the walls of the ally alerting all to 
her presence, but she did not care, all that mattered was getting out of 
that ally and back into the light.  

The circle grew in size as she approached it and a smile crossed her 
face, she was going to make it, she was going to escape death. Her foot 
passed through the edge of the beam of light when something slammed into 
her back. Stunned Debby stopped abruptly, her body half in the light. 
The mask floated over the woman&#39;s shoulder and there was the faint sound 
of a chuckle floating upon the air. Debby suddenly tumbled forwards and 
came to rest in the light. A black stain covered the entirety of her 
back, pulsating and slithering over the woman&#39;s shoulders and across her 
arms. 

Debby glanced up to see the face as it stared down upon at her. She 
could feel it smiling at her even though the only features the mask held 
were those angular slim eye holes and strange curved black markings, and 
yet she could still feel its smile under that mask, a gruesome toothy 
grin. A pain ripped through the woman&#39;s stomach causing her to buckle 
over as she clenched at her gut, something was moving inside of her, 
something horrible. The very idea of that creature inside of her made 
her feel sick to her stomach, abruptly she started to puke, almost as if 
the very thought of vomiting caused her body to react in just. A black, 
tar like, substance spilled forth from her mouth to the dark asphalt 
below her, pooling up on thick globs as it dripped from her lips. The 
smell of death hit her nose a moment later and she began to weep. 

&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; She cried out, &quot;I never did anything wrong.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, but you did.&quot; A voice stated from the shadows, &quot;And you know it. 
You ran from your destiny and now it has come to get you.&quot; 

Debby glanced up to see a tall man dressed in a long white cloak, a mess 
of white curls hung down over his shoulders and cloaked his eyes from 
view, &quot;N... no...&quot; Debby shook her head as she sat upon her knees, her 
arms still around her stomach, and stared up at the man, &quot;I am free.&quot; 
She screamed frantically, &quot;This is not my destiny. You have no right 
doing this to me.&quot; 

The man knelt next to the woman and smiled at her, &quot;Dream Ghosts have no 
rights. They only have a place in dreams.&quot; His grin quickly faded and he 
glared at the women, &quot;Now either you work for me or you give me what is 
mine.&quot; He stated sternly. 

&quot;Go To Hell!!&quot; Debby spat some of the black ooze in the man&#39;s face, &quot;I 
will never work for you or Draigo.&quot;

The man shook his head in disappointment, &quot;That is too bad.&quot; He wiped 
the substance from his face with his fingers and turned his hand over in 
the light, &quot;It is interesting the things that linger deep within you, 
just awaiting for a real chance at life.&quot; The blackness on his hand did 
not reflect any amount of light as he moved his hand before the woman&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;Either you shove it deep within and let it eat you away or let it 
take over you, either way you loss. I guess your choice is to be eaten 
and that is too bad because you were such a nice girl.&quot; 

&quot;N... No!!!&quot; Debby screamed out as the man grabbed the back of her neck 
and forced her face in to the centre of the black mass that she had 
recently vomited up. The moment her face came close to the stuff it 
sprung to life, encircling the woman&#39;s head and completely enveloping it 
in one single motion. The man swiftly stepped back before the blackness 
could devour his own hand with the woman. Within moments the darkness 
pulled the women&#39;s entire body into the pool and it settled back to the 
ground, all signs Debby Lynn Kalter devolved within the mass. 

The man leaned over the pool and waved a hand above it. With three snaps 
of his fingers a bubble began to form in the centre of the puddle. The 
mucky substance pulled back to reveal a white mask that rose into the 
air, the black puddle following closely behind it, forming a pair of 
broad shoulder under a floating cloak.

The man grinned at the sight, &quot;It is time my sister returned home to 
me.&quot; He glanced up, in the direction of the Academy, &quot;You belong to me 
Alyson and you better remember that.&quot;
