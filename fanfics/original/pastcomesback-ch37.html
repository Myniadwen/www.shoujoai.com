<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 37 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a>

<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch36.html">Back to Part 36</a><pre>      Isaka was starting to get tired of this. She would gallantly bust open a door, only to 
find an empty room with another hallway. So far, she kept repeating that same process, just 
trying to find out where Krystal was. After what felt like eternity, she found something 
behind one of the doors.

      Hoshi was passed out on the ground, her weapon discarded beside her along with the 
wooden pole. Isaka looked around, but Krystal wasn&#39;t there... she must have fought Hoshi and 
won. The demon kneeled down next to the silver haired woman and gave her shoulder a slight 
shove. No reaction.

      &quot;Out cold,&quot; she whispered to herself before getting up. There was a malevolent energy 
on the other side of the door, so that could only mean it was the last room.

      Isaka took a second to catch her breath before opening the double doors. Wind rushed 
past her face and the demon was quite sure this was the last room. She trotted down the 
stairs that leads to the pit. Dark symbols illuminated off the wall and there was a swirling 
mass of shadows in the middle.

      Tsuru appeared to be concentrating on releasing the evil contained within, but Isaka 
tensed up when she noticed Krystal was right next to her. &quot;Hey!&quot;

      They both turned around at Isaka&#39;s shout. Tsuru immediately drew both swords and said 
to Krystal, &quot;Wait here.&quot; The blonde woman nodded and stepped to the side as the Demon Lord 
approached Isaka. The interaction didn&#39;t go unnoticed by the demon.

      &quot;Krystal!&quot; She shouted. &quot;What are you doing?&quot; Her lover only awkwardly turned away, 
ignoring her.

      &quot;Just stop, Isaka. She&#39;s not going to listen to you,&quot; Tsuru said, stopping a few feet 
away.

      &quot;What did you do to her?&quot; Isaka asked, drawing her sword.

      &quot;I merely convinced her to help me and I would like it if you would just stand aside.&quot;

      &quot;Like Hell I am!&quot; With that, Isaka leaped at her, swinging her sword wildly. Tsuru 
easily blocked it with her demon blade and stabbed with Krystal&#39;s sword. Isaka moved off to 
the side, barely avoiding it.

      When she counteracted, Tsuru blocked the blow with both her swords , but was pushed 
back. Isaka let out a relieved sigh. Apparently the sword they made was actually working out 
fine - Tsuru didn&#39;t seem to have the upper hand anymore. In fact... the Demon Lord was 
breathing heavily, like she was already winded.

      &quot;What&#39;s wrong Tsuru? I thought you were going to destroy me?&quot;

      Tsuru said nothing, but charged at her again, this time sending out a vortex of light 
and dark energy from her swords. Isaka really wished she knew when to shut her mouth... She 
slashed at it and the darkness dissipated while her blade absorbed the holy energy.

      &quot;What in the world...?&quot; Tsuru asked, still trying to keep up with the demon.

      &quot;It&#39;s a magical sword - actually, it&#39;s technically your swords, but whatever. I don&#39;t 
know what&#39;s running through your pretty little head, but unleashing all those evil swords 
into the world is not a great idea,&quot; Isaka said. &quot;And if I think it isn&#39;t a great idea, 
that&#39;s saying a lot.&quot;

      &quot;You wouldn&#39;t understand a thing,&quot; Tsuru replied, wiping the sweat off her brow with 
the back of her hand. The Lord of Demons charged at Isaka again, but the skirmish ended with 
a nick on Tsuru&#39;s shoulder.

      &quot;Tsuru!&quot; Krystal cried out, obviously worried. Isaka turned at that, but the sight of 
her girlfriend worrying over someone else drove her up a wall. Had Tsuru already...? Did 
Krystal really become her bride? Isaka was rudely jolted out of her thoughts as a blast of 
dark energy knocked her to the ground.

      &quot;I must have... I must have wasted a lot of my energy trying to undo the seal of these 
souls,&quot; Isaka could hear Tsuru saying to Krystal.

      &quot;Then you should probably hurry before you get too tired,&quot; the blonde replied as Isaka 
got up, her body aching.

      &quot;Tsuru, you dumbass! You can&#39;t seriously be doing this,&quot; she shouted out. Tsuru merely 
ignored her and handed gave Krystal back her sword. 

      &quot;Please, take care of her.&quot;

      Isaka tried to run over to Tsuru, but she was intercepted by Krystal. The blonde woman 
stood in front of her, ready to fight. &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me... Krystal, I don&#39;t know 
what she&#39;s done to you, but you have to snap out of it! We&#39;re on the brink of the 
destruction of the world!&quot;

      Krystal said nothing back, but when Isaka tried to run around her, she lashed out with 
her sword. Isaka jumped back in time, shocked. &quot;Please... Krystal, I don&#39;t want to fight 
you!&quot; She said nothing back to Isaka.

      The demon gritted her teeth, more than upset about the circumstances. Sure, Krystal 
had beaten her the first time they met, more so because Isaka underestimated her. But... 
Tsuru knew Isaka wouldn&#39;t lash out at the blonde, so then she&#39;d be able to stall to unleash 
the souls in the pit.

      Isaka charged forward, with the intent of pushing Krystal away. Her lover only blocked 
her hit for hit, power for power. This was going nowhere...

      Suddenly, there was a surge of evil from the center of the pit as Tsuru backed away 
from it. &quot;It&#39;s finally open,&quot; the Demon Lord stated and now Isaka was sure that they were 
all doomed. 

***** 

      &quot;Whoa,&quot; Bakra murmured, coming to a stop in the hallway. A tremor ran through the 
whole entire structure.

      &quot;Glad to know I wasn&#39;t the only one who felt that...&quot; Faye said, worriedly biting a 
nail.

      &quot;Damn it... she must have opened the pit!&quot; Josh looked whirled around to face his 
companions. &quot;Do you think that everyone else at the entrance will be alright? I think we&#39;ll 
have to keep going...&quot;

      &quot;Will... will something try to harm them?&quot; Sakura asked, worried over her family.

      Josh took a deep breath. &quot;Most likely. Since the evil in this place has been unlocked, 
sealed demons are going to start reappearing. With Tycara and Abby in perfect shape, they 
might have trouble. Carmilla should be healing and Erin is resting... so they could be 
alright, but now we&#39;re going to have a tough time...&quot;

      Bakra ruffled his hair as he noticed a skeleton wrapped in dark energy coming near. 
&quot;Ugh, I think we have a visitor...&quot;

      Sakura easily blasted it to bits, but other demons began to appear. Josh readied his 
spear. &quot;We&#39;ll have to fight every one of these things on the way there - otherwise, they&#39;ll 
just attack go back to the entrance to hurt everyone.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Uh oh,&quot; Carmilla said, getting up. &quot;I think they released the souls.&quot;

      &quot;Seriously?&quot; Eveon asked. &quot;Does that mean... we&#39;re all done for?&quot;

      Seth shook his head, looking through a book. &quot;No, the souls may be released, but they 
are trapped inside the pit. In other words, they&#39;d have to cross through the gate to 
infiltrate our world.&quot;

      Mina put two and two together. &quot;So... if Tsuki and Hina opened the gate, then me and 
Eveon... if we don&#39;t reopen it, the evil souls will be stuck?&quot;

      The young man nodded, checking his gun. &quot;Yep. But I suspect the demons will go after 
you for and try to possess you guys first. The souls are going to reanimate the remains of 
things that died here in order to attack us and turn us into evil demons.&quot;

      Abby rolled her eyes and got up with Tycara. &quot;Well, aren&#39;t you nonchalant?&quot;

      Seth grinned. &quot;I trust in you guys and in every one else. We aren&#39;t going to have any 
problems with corpses, I&#39;m sure.&quot;

      Erin shakily got to her feet. &quot;Like... like zombies...? Gross...&quot; She was still 
exhausted, but... she needed to keep everyone safe.

      Carmilla cracked her knuckles. &quot;Okay, so two of us are still weak, but Abby and Tycara 
are in tip top condition. Plus, Seth has a gun.&quot; She grinned. &quot;We should be fine...!&quot;

      &quot;Heed my call! Blades of Heaven and Hell!&quot; Tycara shouted triumphantly, holding Abby&#39;s 
hand. Her mother just let out a sigh.

      &quot;I can&#39;t wait until I can go back to be a normal person...&quot;

      Mina just said, &quot;But aren&#39;t you already not normal? I mean with the bond you share 
with Sakura and getting impregnated by a woman-&quot;

      She was cut off when the first sounds of shuffling caught their attention. A skeleton 
was approaching slowly from the hallway, still a ways away. Their was a loud sound and its 
head exploded.

      &quot;Five points!&quot; Seth said, smiling.

      Carmilla just looked over at him. &quot;Is that how were going to play this?&quot; Another 
skeleton appeared and the vampire summoned a shadow beast to stomp it. &quot;Five points for me 
then, as well.&quot;

      Erin and Abby exchanged glances. &quot;Are they seriously keeping score?&quot; The goddess 
whispered, but Abby could only shrug in reply. 

**** 

      Isaka could only watch as souls and evil began to pour out of the pit Tsuru had just 
unsealed. Lovely, just absolutely lovely. &quot;Krystal!&quot; Tsuru shouted over her shoulder. The 
blonde nodded.

      &quot;Right!&quot; Krystal passed by Isaka without a second glance before kneeling on the 
ground. Isaka was horribly confused as a glowing white seal appeared beneath her girlfriend 
and different markings lit up on the wall.

      Isaka didn&#39;t know arts very well or seals or anything for that matter, but if she 
wasn&#39;t mistaken, Krystal was trying to summon up something holy. And Tsuru was... well...

      &quot;Lord of Demons!&quot; Isaka nearly tripped over her feet at the sound of the 
discombobulated voice roaring throughout the chamber. &quot;Now is the time for demons to rule 
once more!&quot;

      Tsuru looked up at the dark massive being made of souls emerging from the pit. She 
held up her sword, still looking quite tired. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said. &quot;I think I have something 
different in mind.&quot;

      With that, Isaka could feel the surge of holy power coming from Krystal and heading 
straight to the center of the evil energy. The being began to scream. &quot;What are you doing, 
Bride to the Lord of Demons? Would you dare betray us?&quot;

      Isaka watched as Tsuru tried to fight the thing, but was easily swatted aside. What 
was going on? A clawed hand began to form out of the dripping ooze of darkness and it was 
heading right for Krystal. The blonde noticed the predicament she was in, but couldn&#39;t move 
from where she currently was.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I got you!&quot; Isaka easily stepped in from and slashed at the claw. She 
winced as the thing let out another inhuman scream.

      &quot;Damn you all! I will absorb you and reshape the world without your guidance!&quot;

      Isaka really wished she knew what was going on. If anything, she thought that Tsuru 
was going to command all the evil souls and destroy the world, but apparently not. And 
Krystal was hopefully doing something good with all her holy power. &quot;Tsuru, I need more 
time,&quot; Krystal suddenly said. Isaka winced again. Not like she was being ignored after 
saving her girlfriend or anything.

      Tsuru  got up and charged at the thing, but it only grabbed her and squeezed her. 
Isaka wasn&#39;t sure what to do - help out her possessed friend or let her get beaten by an 
evil entity. She didn&#39;t have much time to the think as the monster turned on her, looking 
more like a slime now. Another hand shot out of it and even though Isaka slashed at it, it 
merely grabbed her.

      Then she realized it wasn&#39;t kidding about absorbing her. Isaka could feel the darkness 
well up inside of her, almost drowning her. At this rate, she would go ballistic.

      &quot;Fools! Darkness shall reign over everything!&quot; Isaka ignored its victorious cries as 
she tried to move her arm. Her sword was supposed to cancel out dark energy so... but she 
couldn&#39;t move it enough! It was then that she saw Tsuru get her left arm free, her right 
with her demon sword still stuck.

      She was going to have to take a gamble... &quot;Tsuru!&quot; Her shout got the ebony haired 
woman&#39;s attention and she threw the sword as much as she could in her current situation. 
Tsuru barely caught it and wasted no time slicing off the demon&#39;s hand.

      In its pain, it released Isaka as well, who could only watch as Tsuru tried to keep 
the thing at bay. It was then that she heard Krystal cry out, &quot;I got it!&quot;

      Isaka sat down on her butt, still horribly confused as everything around her flashed 
with a bright white light.
