Twelve thirty-seven. No mistaking it, the clock read 12:37 am, January 
1, 2005. So, Corona really wasn&#39;t coming. No surprise there. Why should 
she? She, despite her dark history and personal angst, could probably 
find better anyway. Why bother coming to Alex&#39;s side? Why tease her and 
drag her along, only to break her heart when she needed her company 
most? Sure, they had went through their first fight not long ago, but 
that was in the past. They had made up. And Corona promised.

So much for promises. That was the extent of human reliability, then, 
wasn&#39;t it? That was the strength of a personal vow to anyone&#151;say 
something, then back out, without even an excuse. Alex had dared trust 
somebody again and was paying for her foolishness. Hope was not a 
flower, ready to bloom into beauty; it was a serrated knife, to be 
jabbed into her chest, over and over again. She actually wept and hated 
herself for it. Furious Hail snorted and threw the pathetic noisemaker 
away.

&quot;Happy fucking New Year!&quot; she snapped. She kicked her wall, several 
times, and moaned. She felt that Corona was the one, that they were 
right for each other! Corona had been a true crown of light to her, a 
guide to pull her out of her own muck, back into the real world, where 
everything was fresh and clean and good... But no, no, it was not meant 
to be. Corona was just like everybody else. They either used, or they 
abused. And Alex thought she loved her. What a waste. What a complete 
waste.

For the first time since her &quot;rehabilitation&quot;, Furious Hail wanted to 
kill herself.

She checked the clock again. It read 12:41.

&quot;Fuck,&quot; she whispered.

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

And if we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means
And I&#39;ve got a twenty-dollar bill

that says you&#39;re up late night starting

fist fights versus fences in your backyard

Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor

Soaking in sympathy

from friends who never loved you

nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable...ohoh

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

If we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

You never knew

well I never told you...

Everything I know about breaking hearts

I learned from you, it&#39;s true

I&#39;ve never done it with the style and grace you have

But I&#39;ve made long term plans

based on these mistakes

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Is this what you call tact?

I swear you&#39;re as subtle as a brick in the small of my back

so let&#39;s end this call,

and end this conversation

there&#39;s nothing worse...

(that&#39;s right he said, that&#39;s right he said it)

I swear, you have no idea

The jealousy that became me thinking

(that&#39;s right he said)

that you always had it way too easy

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!

Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!

&quot;Fuck,&quot; Alex whispered again as the clock turned 12:45 into 12:46. 
&quot;Where the fuck could that girl be?&quot; She spent the next few minutes 
wondering. Was it right to still wait for Corona like this, hopeful in 
spite of the blood that would flow from her hope-scarred heart? Was it 
right to have faith? Faith, ah, something Alex never had nor believed 
in. Surely God hated her, He had her as His example of how wrong a life 
could go, or how sweet a tortured human could be. She was just His 
whipping girl.

&quot;She&#39;d better have a fucking good excuse when I see her in school,&quot; 
growled Alex as the hour died and was replenished anew. Her clock read 
1:01 am, and was threatening to become later. Corona was more late than 
necessary. She had stood Alex up. Well, of course she had. Who would 
waste their time with her? Blair couldn&#39;t handle it anymore; she wept 
and cursed violently, and broke down in the middle of her kitchen floor. 
The clock turned to 1:05.

Her heart paused for just a second as she heard a knock on her door. It 
was 1:06.

She got up to see who it was. It was Corona. She let her in.

&quot;Hi,&quot; she said meekly, &quot;sorry I&#39;m late.&quot; Blair crossed her arms, and 
scowled. &quot;Okay, sorry I&#39;m very late. Can I come in?&quot; She sighed. Alex 
wanted to push Corona out into the road...but she didn&#39;t.

&quot;Sure.&quot; The door closed and was locked again as her guest finally, 
finally joined her, two hours later than expected. Corona hung back 
shyly, looking ashamed and hurt; Alex was seething with fury. Her voice 
was calm, though, calm and careful as a dam that could burst at the 
slightest touch...

&quot;So, what kept you?&quot;

&quot;Allie, I have a really good excuse,&quot; said Corona desperately.

&quot;I&#39;m listening.&quot;

&quot;Alonso&#151;my brother, remember&#151;he was called out for an emergency at the 
very last second, and I had to drive him. Mom&#39;s...my mother just died 
today, at the institution. We had to go there to make funeral 
arrangements. I know we had a date today, I just...I couldn&#39;t tear 
myself away from that place. Allie...I lost my mother today. Now I&#39;m 
just an orphan, with only my brother to take care of me. I made it here 
as soon as I could; sorry I&#39;m late. Can you forgive me?&quot;

Alex crumbled on the inside. God, what kind of a monster am I? Here I am 
angry about my girlfriend being late, and I don&#39;t even fucking know why. 
She just lost her fucking mother, you idiot&#151;spare her some sympathy!

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, weeping gently. &quot;I just thought...you had stood 
me up.&quot;

&quot;No, no,&quot; she assured her softly. &quot;You&#39;ve been on my mind all day. I 
couldn&#39;t wait to come here, it&#39;s just...my mom.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; she managed, bringing Corona in for a hug. &quot;I&#39;m so stupid 
and selfish...why do you ever put up with me?&quot;

&quot;Because I love you,&quot; she said honestly, touching Alex&#39;s dark hair. Alex 
sniffled and managed a smile, and squeezed Corona with all the love that 
had been buried inside of her, deep down, under the ash. Perhaps a 
phoenix would emerge from the funeral pyre after all...

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; said Alex again, &quot;I just...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right. I&#39;m here now. Better late than never, eh? Sorry I 
couldn&#39;t spend the New Year with you.&quot;

&quot;Ah...fuck it,&quot; she said, grinning weakly. &quot;I don&#39;t care about that. I 
just...wanted to be with you.&quot; She smiled shyly and lowered her head; 
Corona saw her blush, and squealed. She raised Alex&#39;s head and enveloped 
her lips softly. The two held each other with such gentle, tender care, 
kissing deeper and deeper until they felt they would merge. Alex only 
wished that her faith had been stronger, that her love had been deeper. 
She felt so worthless for doubting Corona.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she breathed as Marcos kissed her ear.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry too. I forgive you.&quot;

&quot;...I forgive you too!&quot; she managed through tears. Corona leaned her 
head back and gasped as her beloved planted her dry, chapped lips along 
her neck, and held Alex by her hands, wanting nothing more, with nobody 
else, save Alex. Alex, her Allie; that was all she wanted in that 
moment, and nothing more. No New Year, no misunderstandings, no promises 
unwillingly broken, nothing but Alex; that was all that mattered.

She guided her into the living room, kissing her neck and jawline, 
absorbing Allie&#39;s taste through her mouth. She was a bitter woman, they 
both were, but the bitterness was made unbearably sweet when mixed with 
tears of regret and love. Corona hissed as she felt Alex&#39;s hands wander, 
and raised her arms so she could have her sweater removed. Their lips 
clashed desperately and only parted so that Blair&#39;s A-shirt could be 
lifted off as well, and then resumed, mindlessly beautiful.

Alex knelt down, letting her fingers fumble with the button and zipper 
of Corona&#39;s jeans, and kissed her stomach and belly button in the 
meantime. Corona squeezed her eyes shut, and combed through her 
girlfriend&#39;s beautiful long hair until it was time for her legs to 
release themselves from her jeans. Breathlessly, her heart jumping up 
and down, she took Alex into her embrace and guided her tongue inside 
her mouth, and there it stayed until she felt the time was right.

Corona gently kissed her way down and removed Alex&#39;s long black pants, 
and kissed her underwear once it was revealed. Alex let out a deep moan, 
in shock that this was actually happening to her&#151;that the woman she 
loved, her light in the world, was giving her this pleasure. She 
carefully guided Corona up as the woman tugged at her panties, and 
helped remove her ratty brassiere. Marcos grinned and kissed Alex&#39;s 
eager nipples before the material even found its way to the floor.

A second pair joined them. Alex wept for joy and hugged her girlfriend 
close, hissing and sighing as their breasts touched, and rubbed 
together, and squeezed gently. Alex dove into Corona&#39;s cleavage and let 
her tongue trail everywhere; Corona moaned happily, and raked her 
fingernails across her girlfriend&#39;s naked back and shoulders, anything 
to return this love, this love that had been so dormant, a love that was 
now being freed and released, like...

Like a flower, blooming at last, after a merciless winter.

Allie took Corona to her bed and watched as she removed her own 
underwear. She grinned and let Corona take hers off&#151;she felt defenseless 
once she was nude, but Corona accepted her and loved her, and even 
gasped with pure love (mixed with just a hint of lust) as she stared at 
the naked Alexandra. Corona herself was indescribably beautiful, and 
Alex feared taking her into her arms, into her life, for surely she 
would taint such an angel. Corona nodded quietly, assuring her 
girlfriend that she would not mind. Besides, she too was tainted.

Alex laid down in bed with Corona atop her, and cried out several times 
just from the weight of the other girl. She could feel everything: her 
coffee-colored hair, her lips touching in random spots, her heaving 
chest and hypnotic bosom, her stomach, her wandering arms and ticklish 
fingers, her naked waist and crotch, her fleshy legs, her toes meshing 
together against her soles... Alex felt Corona, like nothing she had 
known or felt before, even from Marcos in the past. She was really, 
truly feeling Corona, as she really was, for the first time ever.

She stared deep into those wonderful brown eyes and felt two fingers 
penetrate her starving vagina. Alexandra cried out with bliss as the 
woman whom she loved, more than anything, her light in this world, gave 
her the apex of physical pleasure&#151;so she returned it, lowering her hand 
to find Corona&#39;s own genitalia. Marcos squeezed her eyes shut and called 
out her name&#151;&quot;Ugh, Allie!&quot;&#151;so beautifully, and thrust her fingers to 
match Alex&#39;s, until the two were crying out and moaning with the 
increased rhythm of their shared sex.

&quot;ALEX!!!&quot; Corona called out the name of her beloved and achieved a 
wonderful orgasm; Alex, however, wept bitterly as she felt her first 
real, honest orgasm in ages. Corona calmed down as her breathing did, 
and stared at the beautiful young woman with such love and kindness: 
what could be wrong?

&quot;Alex? Alex, honey? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Alex continued to weep, horribly and 
uncontrollably, and held onto Corona for dear life, as if the last 
remnants of her identity were being lost.

&quot;I love you,&quot; she whispered hoarsely. &quot;I love you so much!! I&#39;m sorry 
for everything!&quot;

&quot;Alex, Alex honey...&quot; She wept even more, holding so tight, so 
desperate, unable to believe that somebody so wonderful could really 
love her that much. Corona kissed her, she kissed the tears away, and 
hummed softly as this fallen angel cried. She whispered, &quot;I love you, I 
love you so much, I love you, my beautiful Alex, my gorgeous Angel.&quot;

Finally, Allie sniffled and stopped crying. She was smiling more broadly 
and more happily than she ever had, and held Corona&#39;s face close so they 
could gaze at each other anew, as if it had been years since they last 
saw each other. She wailed sweetly, &quot;Corona, Corona, my beautiful 
Corona,&quot; and kissed her deeply, sweetly. Corona suckled on Alex&#39;s tongue 
as it came into her mouth; their breasts hugged lovingly as their sexes 
rubbed against each other.

&quot;I love you so much, Alex,&quot; she whispered. Alex could only utter her 
name.

Corona... They switched, and Alex, beaming like a happy sun goddess, 
straddled Corona lustily. She rubbed both the girl&#39;s breasts, playing 
with her nipples, sometimes leaning down to tease them with her 
tongue&#151;everything was a jolt of unbelievable pleasure. Corona gasped for 
joy as Alex bent down, exposing her naked rear happily to everything 
behind her, and lapped at Corona&#39;s vagina. Her eyes shut tight as sweet 
perfection&#151;what else could she call it?&#151;wiggled inside her, pleasuring 
every corner and concept that was Her. She came to a violent, wonderful 
orgasm, hopelessly spraying her beloved with her own fluid. Alex laughed 
and cleaned it off hungrily.

&quot;Your turn,&quot; she sang happily. Alex gladly laid down on the bed and 
smiled as her weary girlfriend sighed, moved around, and buried her face 
in her vagina. A few licks in, she held her head back, stared, and 
grinned cutely.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she sang, &quot;so that&#39;s your true hair color.&quot;

&quot;Hey, what&#39;re you doing?!&quot; exclaimed Alex happily. Corona giggled and 
descended again.

&quot;Oh, nothing. Just admiring your bush, that&#39;s all. Maybe you 
could...wear your hair in its natural color when we get back to school.&quot; 
Alex grunted as she felt Corona&#39;s tongue penetrate further inside her.

&quot;Uh&#151;you think so?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot;

&quot;Aah, that tickled!&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Corona looked up and smiled mischievously. So, her girlfriend 
liked it when she hummed in her vagina, eh? She went back down and 
hummed a soft song, making Alex squeal hopelessly with pleasure. She 
bucked and forced Corona&#39;s head down further with her free hands, 
calling her name out again and again until she came to her second orgasm 
of the evening.&quot;

&quot;AAH!! CORONAAA...!!!&quot;

Once the two girls recovered, they both sat up and embraced, naked and 
in love, until their kisses evolved into groping, and groping into heavy 
fondling, and fondling into shared cunnilingus: a sixty-nine, where they 
both feasted on each other&#39;s fruits, but Alex dared let her tongue 
explore elsewhere, and lapped at Corona&#39;s hindquarters.

&quot;Aah!&quot; her girlfriend squeaked. &quot;Alex!&quot;

&quot;What? Can I not lick my girlfriend&#39;s ass?&quot;

&quot;...Would you want to do that?&quot;

&quot;...Sure, why not?&quot; Corona was initially disgusted by the idea&#151;after 
all, she shuddered when she thought about kissing Alex afterwards&#151;but 
stuck in that position, eventually she was turned on by the idea. She 
lapped at her girlfriend&#39;s partially-exposed rear and liked it, a 
little. Alex seemed to like it a lot.

&quot;I guess that means I can proceed,&quot; she squealed happily. Corona 
chuckled&#151;and then moaned viciously as she felt her girlfriend&#39;s tongue 
slither inside her anus. WOW! That was a new feeling! She wedged her 
fingers inside Alex&#39;s moist vagina, just in case, and applied herself to 
returning the favor. It seemed to take days, and seconds, to reach 
orgasms three and four; number five came later, as Alex wrestled her 
lover to the bed, poised her thighs over Corona&#39;s eager crotch, and 
growled lustfully.

&quot;Sexy,&quot; she purred into her ear. Corona giggled.

&quot;And you are a pretty little princess.&quot; Alex had never been addressed so 
sweetly, nor so honestly, and blushed a gorgeous pink color as she 
smiled, clasped her hands over Corona&#39;s, and slowly wiggled her vagina 
against Corona&#39;s. Wiggling turned to cautious thrusting, which evolved 
into rubbing and all-out grinding, until they both groaned and screamed 
themselves into their fifth, and possibly last, orgasm of the evening. 
Alex collapsed on Corona&#39;s naked body, laughing and gasping loudly as 
their shared nudity meshed. They kissed until they were weary, and 
shirked the covers of the old bed so they could at least have a chance 
to cool down.

&quot;...Holy God almighty!&quot; exclaimed Allie, her face beaming. &quot;Damn, 
Corona! We&#39;re insatiable!&quot;

&quot;Well, I can&#39;t help it,&quot; she said, cuddling close despite how hot and 
sweaty her lover was. &quot;You make me really horny, and I love you. I love 
you...a lot.&quot; They laughed again, and held each other in spite of the 
heat. Corona gently took one of Alex&#39;s breasts in her hand, looked up 
into her eyes, and smiled. &quot;I truly...love you...my sweet Allie.&quot;

They kissed deeply, intimately, freely exploring each other with 
fingers, thighs, and tongue.

&quot;I love you too, my wonderful angel of light.&quot; They shared a smile. 
Corona squeezed &quot;her&quot; breast gently.

&quot;I think we should take a shower.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, really. As soon...as I can stand...on my own power!&quot; They laughed 
and kissed, and finally, made their way to the crude, cramped shower. 
They stayed longer than necessary, of course, probably to make sure that 
they both got &quot;really, really clean, especially in all the fun places&quot;. 
They kissed as they dried each other off, and Corona almost carried her 
naked lover back to her bedroom. They laughed and tumbled on the bed, 
and kissed sweetly for minutes on end. When at last they stopped, their 
faces were shining and their bodies were intertwined; Alex yawned.

&quot;What time is it?&quot; Corona checked.

&quot;Four...fifty-nine.&quot; Alex raised her head. She smiled as it became five 
o&#39;clock.

&quot;We&#39;ve been going at it for awhile.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Good thing we don&#39;t have school in the morning.&quot; They laughed 
again and kissed, holding each other tight so they could feel the 
beautiful skin of their lovers. Alex finally rested her head on Corona&#39;s 
chest, feeling her heart thudding quietly, and touched the girl&#39;s hands 
as they intertwined.

&quot;Corona?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Allie?&quot; She snickered. She sure did love being called that.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too.&quot;

And those were the last words either of them heard before they fell 
asleep, safe in each other&#39;s arms, mere hours before dawn broke to 
reveal a beautiful morning.

&quot;The division of one day from the next must be one of the most profound 
peculiarities of life on this planet. It is, on the whole, a merciful 
arrangement. We are not condemned to sustain flights of being, but are 
constantly refreshed by little holidays from ourselves. We are 
intermittent creatures, always falling to little ends and rising to 
little new beginnings. Our soon-tired consciousness is meted out in 
chapters, and that the world will look quite different tomorrow is, for 
both our comfort and our discomfort, usually true. How marvelously too 
night matches sleep, sweet image of it, so neatly apportioned to our 
need. Angels must wonder at these beings who fall so regularly out of 
awareness into a fantasm-invested dark. How our frail identities survive 
these chasms no philosopher has ever been able to explain.&quot; --Iris 
Murdoch, The Black Prince
