<h1>Project Angelus (part 13 of 32)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/projectangelus-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>      As Miki exited the room, she almost bumped right into Tsuki carrying an ice bucket. 
&quot;Oh!&quot; the brunette said, quickly steadying herself. &quot;What are you doing out here, Miki?&quot;

      &quot;Uh... I was just going to go get something to eat,&quot; the girl responded trying to go 
around Tsuki. The other just continued to block her path, a confused look on her face.

      &quot;If you want to eat, my sisters and I already have some food in our room. There&#39;s no 
point in leaving the hotel and putting yourself at risk for getting attacked,&quot; Tsuki 
rationalized. &quot;Plus, you don&#39;t want to give away our position.&quot;

      Miki just waved off her suggestion. &quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine. I promise I&#39;ll be discreet-&quot;

      She was cut off as Tsuki started walking forward and pushing Miki towards their room. 
&quot;It would be much better if you just stayed.&quot;

      At that point, Hina came out of the room with the intention of seeing what the 
conversation outside was about. &quot;Huh? Is Miki going to eat dinner with us?&quot;

      Tsuki nodded. &quot;Yes she is.&quot;

      Miki just looked between the two. &quot;Hey! Don&#39;t I have a choice?&quot;

      It was then that Hoshi came to the doorway as well, a welcoming smile on her face. 
&quot;Why, we would love to have you for dinner, Miki!&quot;

      Miki was a rather fast girl, but she wasn&#39;t fast enough to escape their clutches and 
soon found herself making up excuses. &quot;No! I need to get my stuff,&quot; she lied, since her 
sword and backpack were on her, &quot;And Eveon will be worried and-! And-!&quot;

      Her pleas fell on deaf ears as she was dragged inside. 

***** 

      &quot;Are... are you sure you&#39;re alright?&quot; Sakura asked, lightly kissing Abby&#39;s 
fingertips.

      &quot;Yes, you already healed me,&quot; Abby responded with a slight laugh. &quot;You make it sound 
like I fell off a cliff.&quot;

      Sakura seemed temporary horrified at the thought. &quot;If that ever happens... I will 
catch you...!&quot;

      Marx let out a slight snort, reminding the couple that he was in the room. 
&quot;Considering the circumstances and... ah, who Adrian is... I think I will excuse myself to 
take a long... long... trip to the vending machine and leave you two to do whatever.&quot;

      Abby gave him a confused look. &quot;But don&#39;t you have something important to talk to 
Sakura about?&quot;

      The young man brightened up. &quot;Oh, so you would like me to stay and join in on your 
love fest?&quot;

      It didn&#39;t take long for Sakura to shove Marx out the door and yank his key card away 
from him. That would ensure no barging in, but regardless of how obnoxious he could be, she 
knew he would never do something that intrusive.

      The angel let out a sigh as she settled back down on the bed next to Abby. The blonde 
woman wrapped her arms around her before letting out a slight laugh. &quot;My hands may be a bit 
cut, but my fingers are still perfectly fine.&quot;

      Sakura smiled and leaned in closer to her. &quot;Perhaps... we should enjoy this while we 
can... Marx will be back eventually...&quot;

      Abby just took the key card from her and tossed it away. &quot;Yeah, but he&#39;ll just have 
to wait outside the door.&quot; She tenderly kissed the angel on the lips as they lied down on 
the hotel bed together.

      Silence permeated through the room for a bit, until Sakura asked, &quot;Aren&#39;t you 
curious... about Adrian?&quot;

      Abby shrugged as she stared at the feeling. &quot;Of course I am, especially since he 
asked you to marry him... but... it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve told you everything about Terry and I. 
I&#39;m not going to ask if it bothers you that much.&quot;

      Sakura just pushed herself deeper into Abby&#39;s arms and said, &quot;I lied to you... about 
how exactly Tycara died. I left him out, Adrian... I didn&#39;t even remember that was his 
name. I don&#39;t remember my brother&#39;s name either, but... I...&quot;

      The angel paused. &quot;I was arranged to marry Adrian before Tycara&#39;s father raped me... 
after it happened, we decided that I would give away Tycara after she was born. But I 
couldn&#39;t give her... I just couldn&#39;t and he... he said he would refuse to marry me unless I 
got rid of her. He couldn&#39;t stand the thought of me caring for another man&#39;s child.&quot;

      &quot;Then he was an angel,&quot; Abby said aloud, clarifying the story.

      Sakura nodded. &quot;He was such a sweet, kind young man. I thought we would be happy 
together... I didn&#39;t love him, but it was... it was like having a comforting blanket around 
you... that&#39;s how I felt. He treated me so well, but I saw the monster inside of him the 
moment I refused to give up Tycara... it was horrible...&quot;

      She looked into Abby&#39;s eyes. &quot;He was... he was the one who beat Tycara on the night 
of the festival. She&#39;d accidentally gotten into the city when an angel mistook her for a 
normal child looking for her mother. He found out who Tycara was after she said I was her 
mother and he beat her in front of everyone.&quot;

      Abby tried to wipe away her tears as the angel started to cry. &quot;He wouldn&#39;t stop! He 
was going to kill her and by the time I was close enough to stop it, her power erupted and 
it started to kill everyone nearby. It was... all his fault because he couldn&#39;t accept it. 
He just couldn&#39;t accept the fact that I loved Tycara more than him...!&quot;

      Sakura hid her face in Abby&#39;s chest and said no more. The blonde woman already knew 
what happened next - Sakura killed Tycara to save the very people that hated her... or at 
the least, the man who hated her more than anything.

      &quot;Such a... vile man...&quot; Sakura whimpered. &quot;I wish... he was dead... he... after I 
killed Tycara... he asked me to marry him a second time... he&#39;s worse than anything I&#39;ve 
ever seen...&quot;

      Abby just ran her fingers through Sakura&#39;s hair soothingly. &quot;It&#39;s alright... that 
jerk is going to get what&#39;s coming to him, right? Please don&#39;t worry... please...&quot;

      &quot;I don&#39;t know how he... how he&#39;s still alive,&quot; Sakura said. &quot;He must have 
experimented on his body heavily after he was exiled... I just... wish Tycara had killed 
him back then...&quot; 

***** 

      Tycara visibly shuddered and Seth turned to her in concern. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

      His girlfriend just looked away. &quot;So the girl... we&#39;re rescuing...?&quot;

      Josh ran a hand through his hair. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re rescuing an angel.&quot; Bakra and Seth had 
gone through great lengths to avoid actually telling Tycara, but now... there was just  no 
way around it.

      Bakra nodded. &quot;The Guardian of Light, too. That makes her an important figure in the 
scheme of the world as well as with the angels.&quot;

      They were sitting in a hotel room, lying low. Seth came up with a plan in conjunction 
with Erin and Faye - they would break in with the assistance of the two goddesses.

      &quot;An angel... huh...?&quot; Tycara murmured out, looking none too pleased. She drew her 
knees to her chest, burying her face behind her arms.

      Josh, who didn&#39;t know about Tycara&#39;s past, was the one to ask the question. &quot;Why? Is 
there something wrong with-&quot;

      &quot;I hate angels!&quot; Tycara shouted, still hiding. &quot;They&#39;re the real monsters!&quot;

      Josh was taken aback. &quot;But your mo-&quot; Bakra stamped on his lover&#39;s foot to keep him 
from continuing on the topic.

      &quot;Perhaps,&quot; the demon said, emphasizing his words. &quot;We should go pick up some Chinese 
food.&quot;

      Josh grimaced in pain and gave Bakra an odd look. &quot;Why Chinese? And why did you-&quot;

      Bakra started to push Josh out of the room as Seth gave him a thankful expression. 
Soon, both the demon and exorcist were gone, leaving Seth to comfort his girlfriend. He 
awkwardly put a hand on her shoulder as he sat down next to her on the bed.

      &quot;Hey,&quot; he murmured. &quot;It&#39;s going to be just fine...&quot;

      Tycara didn&#39;t bother moving. &quot;Why should we save her anyway?&quot;

      Seth took some time to think of the best way to rationalize it. He knew his 
girlfriend still had a childlike mind because she wasn&#39;t mentally stable, but at the same 
time, she was no fool. Seth understood why she wouldn&#39;t want to save an angel at all. Him 
saying they were all jerks earlier probably didn&#39;t help things.

      &quot;Tycara... if you were really hurt and the only people that could save you were 
angels, you&#39;d want them too help right?&quot; She nodded slowly. &quot;Well, if they didn&#39;t help you 
just because you were a half angel, half demon wouldn&#39;t that be wrong?&quot;

      She looked up at him. &quot;Of course it would be wrong...! But I wouldn&#39;t be 
surprised...&quot;

      &quot;Aren&#39;t you doing the exact same thing to the Guardian of Light then?&quot;

      Tycara perked up at that. &quot;But... she&#39;s probably just as mean as everyone else.&quot;

      &quot;That doesn&#39;t matter. She&#39;s in pain and if you&#39;re refusing to help her, then you&#39;re 
no different than the angels that hated you.&quot;

      She began to get upset at his logic. &quot;But it&#39;s not the same! I don&#39;t call people 
monsters or hurt them for no reason!&quot;

      Seth tried to calm her down a bit. &quot;I&#39;m just saying that... if you act the same way 
as the angels, then they&#39;re going to keep on hating you. You have to be able to overcome 
that and show that you&#39;re better than them.&quot;

      Tycara pouted at the thought. &quot;But they... they are...&quot;

      He gave her a hug. &quot;Hey now... it&#39;s been a long time, okay? And I&#39;m not going to let 
anyone hurt you...&quot;

      She just burrowed into her chest, still unhappy about the circumstances. &quot;Thank you, 
Seth... you&#39;re the best guy ever... I wish...&quot; She let out a slight whimper. &quot;I wish you 
weren&#39;t getting older.&quot;

      He laughed because he was still in his early twenties. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about that stuff 
now. We have plenty of time, okay? Plus, we&#39;re going to eat dinner soon... unless you want 
to keep looking unhappy and guilt trip Bakra into buying you ice cream again...&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Let&#39;s see how you&#39;re doing...&quot; Eric was talking mostly to himself, since his patient 
was rigged up to a myriad of wires and tubes that she couldn&#39;t speak. There was a breathing 
apparatus over her mouth to make sure she was properly respirating.

      The young man looked through the different readouts on her condition and consulted 
the man computers that were receiving input from the wires. He frowned. It was going to 
take her a while to recover - it certainly didn&#39;t help that she was suffering from dark 
energy poisoning.

      &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll agree with me that you&#39;re captor was a bitch, huh? She just had to 
go and torture you to near death...&quot; Eric turned around only to see intense blue eyes 
looking dreamily at him. Looks like he woke her up from her nap. &quot;Sorry about all the 
machines and such. You dying would be bad for everyone. Particularly you.&quot;

      It was unfortunate he didn&#39;t have a proper facility for treating the angel... he 
didn&#39;t like the fact that she was resting in the bed due to the injuries on her wings. 
Lilith just had to go overboard... but at least she was forced to take her serum now.

      Eric began to root through some of the cabinets in the dimly lit room before finding 
the medicine he wanted. He switched the IV bag and then proceeded to inject the young woman 
with the brownish substance in the syringe.

      She eyed him with some suspicion but didn&#39;t even let out a sound. Perhaps that was 
how she was able to survive months of torture - simply desensitizing herself. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry,&quot; he said, removing the needle from her arm. &quot;It&#39;s simply a special product I created 
to help stimulate the production of blood. It&#39;s originally for people suffering from 
anemia, but if it works well enough, it can help reduce the amount of blood transfusions 
needed. The FDA is still testing it, but I promise it&#39;s safe.&quot;

      He smiled down at the girl, but her eyes moved to focus on the ceiling. &quot;The silent 
type, eh? Then again, the tube in your mouth probably isn&#39;t helping.&quot; Eric took a glance at 
his computers again. &quot;Maybe I should start putting you on pureed foods...&quot;

      She looked back over at him and Eric decided that she was all for anything that 
wasn&#39;t being injected into her. She couldn&#39;t move yet, but he was sure she could sit up 
and- He let out a groan of frustration as his pager went off. &quot;I&#39;m really, really sorry, 
but I will be back in a moment.&quot;

      He left the room, locking the door behind him, and quickly went back to his office 
nearby. Erin was sitting at her desk, still organizing files for him. The reason he was 
being paged was standing next to her, flirting idly with the uninterested girl. Eric 
thought it was a funny sight before clearing his throat.

      Adrian looked over at him and Erin was relieved to be no longer the center of the 
blonde man&#39;s attention. He gave her the creeps... &quot;Eric... I have some things I need to 
discuss with you.&quot;

      The professor ran a hand through his messy auburn hair. &quot;Right now? I&#39;m kind of busy 
with our super important prisoner of war at the moment that your girlfriend brutally half 
killed.&quot;

      Erin straightened up in her chair at the sound of that and Eric kind of wished he&#39;d 
chosen better words. Adrian just waved it off. &quot;Just let your secretary handle it. She 
seems competent enough. Ms. Schlange is bound to know about what happens here sooner or 
later, seeing as how she&#39;s the subordinate of the company&#39;s number two man.&quot;

      &quot;Alright... fine...&quot; Eric went over to his secretary and grabbed her ID badge. &quot;I&#39;m 
going to update this so you have special access to room 420A. There&#39;s a patient in there 
and I want you to remove the tubes from her mouth and sit her up in the bed.&quot;

      Erin was confused as her badge was scanned by a special device attached to Eric&#39;s 
computer. &quot;Wait... what? Are you sure I should be taking care of-&quot;

      &quot;There are manuals and instructions in that room, &quot;Adrian said. &quot;Knowing Eric, he 
most likely left those things around, right?&quot;

      The young man nodded. &quot;Sorry about this Erin. Just take good care of her and start 
feeding her the soft foods I left in the fridge.&quot;

      As Adrian headed out of the door, he took out his cell phone. &quot;Just to be sure, I&#39;ll 
have security send an agent down to meet you so you can enter the room properly.&quot; He gave 
her a wink and Eric followed him out, pretending to gag at the other man&#39;s actions.

      It all happened so fast that the brunette was still highly confused as they left. 
Special access? Had they willingly just handed her the ability to see what she hoped was 
the angel? She let out a sigh at how easy it all was. The only problem would be the 
security agent...

      Oh well - it wasn&#39;t anything she couldn&#39;t handle. Erin hurried out of the room with 
her new, special badge. It was the same old one, but now... well, not only could she get to 
one of the top floors with it, she could also get into room 420A, where the angel was being 
held.

      Erin stopped in front of the correct room and slid her badge down the side of the 
card reader. The tiny gray screen next to it, above the pad of numbers, simply stated 
&#39;ERROR&#39;. The young woman frowned and tried again, with the same results. What was she 
supposed to do now? Page Eric to let him know that she was an incompetent evil organization 
secretary?

      As she was about to try a third time, Erin felt someone from behind press against 
her. &quot;You have to enter the security code as well,&quot; a husky voice murmured into her ear. 
Erin shuddered and watched a slim, confident hand press in the correct four digit code. It 
unlocked. &quot;There you go...&quot;

      Erin smiled to herself as she opened the door and walked in. As soon as it shut 
behind them and locked, the snake goddess wasted no time shoving the security officer 
against the metal door and kissing her mouth. She fumbled with the other woman&#39;s blouse and 
jacket for a minute before finding those breasts she so loved to fondle.

      She wasn&#39;t going to lie to herself - she&#39;d become almost as much of a pervert as her 
lover, but she just hid it better.

      &quot;I missed you too,&quot; Faye gasped out, pushing Erin away slightly. &quot;And here I thought 
I was going to get the first jump on you.&quot;

      Erin stuck out her tongue, &quot;Well I guess you owe me a favor now, since I won the 
bet.&quot;

      Faye scoffed as she rearranged her outfit. &quot;Yeah, but I did surprise you, didn&#39;t I?&quot;

      &quot;But the deal was to see who could surprise the other intimately first,&quot; Erin 
replied, fixing her hair. She paused to look at Faye. &quot;I never took you for a brunette...&quot;

      The love goddess just laughed, twirling a piece of her plain Jane, mousy brown hair. 
&quot;I wasn&#39;t much of a looker before I became a goddess... but your hair is still really 
nice...&quot;

      She rearranged a few pieces that got out of place before giving Erin a kiss on the 
lips. The two of them decided to keep each other&#39;s positions in the organization a secret 
for a while... they didn&#39;t want to raise too much suspicion so they even had to rent out 
different places to live.

      &quot;My place or yours,&quot; Erin breathed out.

      &quot;Yours,&quot; Faye said. &quot;You won the bet so it will be your place... and I guess I&#39;ll 
find out what you have in store for me.&quot;

      &quot;Alright, but we should probably get to the angel...&quot; The door to room 402A actually 
led to a hallway connecting to room 402B. Erin was able to get in easily, thanks to Faye 
telling her the code. &quot;How exactly did you get down here to see me?&quot;

      Faye laughed as the door unlocked. &quot;Well, I charmed my way into the security 
sector... like, surveillance and going over files. I happened to see your trip onto Eric 
Ackhart, by the way... good job.&quot;

      Erin frowned. &quot;It was an accident... though I guess it did help tremendously...&quot;

      &quot;Anyway, when Adrian, Mr. CEO and big baddie called in wanting an agent up here to 
help you, I merely used my lovely feminine wiles to convince them to let me be your partner 
in opening these doors and caring for the prisoner.&quot;

      Erin sighed as she opened the door. &quot;I know you can charm anyone into being 
infatuated with you, but don&#39;t overuse it...&quot;

      &quot;I won&#39;t... though I&#39;m happy I can&#39;t charm you, anyway,&quot; Faye whispered. &quot;At least I 
know what we have is true and pure.&quot;

      Faye caught the blush on Erin&#39;s cheeks right before the young woman entered the dimly 
lit room. The snake goddess held back a gasp at the amount of medical devices in the room. 
Eric said to disconnect the tube in the patient&#39;s mouth... so...

      As she started to dismantle it according to the instructions in a book she found, 
Faye casually remarked, &quot;I guess she really is the angel we&#39;re looking for... she&#39;s in as 
bad a shape as Eveon described...&quot;

      Erin was relieved once she got the apparatus off of Dark. &quot;I&#39;ve already started 
infiltrating the building, so we should get her out of here once she heals enough. Eric&#39;s 
been tending to her wounds so I don&#39;t see any reason for us to move her so quickly.&quot;

      &quot;Infiltrating?&quot; Faye asked. &quot;What do you mean...?&quot;

      Erin motioned to one of the vents in the room. &quot;Why don&#39;t you take a look for 
yourself?&quot;

      Although confused, she did as her lover asked. Faye peered into the vent in the 
ceiling and was shocked as it was jostled out of place. A snake slowly lowered itself down, 
the rest of its long body still in the ventilation system. It flickered out its tongue a 
few times, as though to greet the young woman in front of it.

      As it retreated, Faye began to chuckle. &quot;Wow... you have been training your 
powers...&quot;

      Erin smiled. &quot;Thank you. It&#39;s amazing that they listen to me... I guess they really 
do adore me like a mother.&quot;

      As she started to help Dark sit up in bed, the angel let out a sharp cry of pain and 
opened her eyes. Erin grimaced, knowing she must have aggravated an injury, but continued 
until Dark was in the correct position. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

      The angel just looked absolutely terrified. &quot;We&#39;re here to help you,&quot; Erin said. 
&quot;Eventually, we&#39;re going to get you out of her and to a safe place.&quot;

      She didn&#39;t look convinced at all and tried to sink into the bed. However, with her 
injuries and all the wires connected to her, Dark couldn&#39;t even attempt to escape. Faye 
came over and said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you get her food ready. I&#39;m sure I can get her to be a 
little friendlier.&quot;

      Erin gave her lover a wry smile before going over to the tiny refrigerator tucked 
under the lab table against the wall. Faye sat down in the chair next to Dark and tried to 
look the girl in the eye... she only looked 16, but she was still frightened of them.

      &quot;Hey...&quot; Faye cooed out, forcing the girl to look at her by holding her chin steady. 
The angel reluctantly gazed into her teal eyes and the goddess was pleased as soon as a 
faint blush covered Dark&#39;s cheeks. She let go, but the girl was still intent on looking at 
her.

      &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; Faye asked, knowing that she&#39;d charmed the girl into being 
infatuated with her.

      &quot;...D-Dark,&quot; she stuttered out, still blushing.

      Erin came over and sat next to Faye, holding a jar with orange sludge and a spoon. 
&quot;You and your charming skills...&quot; she murmured, unscrewing the lid.

      &quot;Hey, I can&#39;t put snakes in the vents, so I have to do something,&quot; Faye remarked, 
winking at Dark, who immediately stared down at her lap. &quot;...how cute...&quot;

      Erin gave her a dubious look as she spooned some of the mush, which was really 
blended peaches. &quot;Am I being dumped?&quot;

      Faye straightened up immediately at that statement, a look of horror on her face. 
&quot;Erin! I would... I would never do that to you, or our love! I may look at other men and 
women, mostly women, but I love you more than anything and only act in threeways with your 
explicit cooperation and permission... Please don&#39;t leave me!&quot;

      Erin was shocked at her outburst and guided the spoon to Dark&#39;s lips. &quot;I... I... I 
was just kidding Faye. I know you would never betray my trust...&quot;

      The love goddess let out a relieved sigh. &quot;You really had me going there...&quot;

      In the back of her mind, Erin made a mental note to never joke about infidelity ever 
again. Dark eyed the substance warily until Faye looked over at her again. The angel began 
to eat vigorously, only pausing to drink from the glass Erin offered her.

      After some time, Erin murmured, &quot;I can understand why Hoshi fell in love with her 
sisters...&quot;

      Faye gave her a curious look and she continued with a smile. &quot;Well, Dark&#39;s just so 
helpless and cute that you just want to take her home and take care of her... I get the 
feeling that&#39;s how Hoshi first felt and it snowballed into something more.&quot;

      &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Faye replied. &quot;I&#39;m just glad they&#39;re doing alright and Hoshi isn&#39;t calling 
me so frequently.&quot;

      Erin giggled as she continued to spoon feed the angel. &quot;Oh, I remember. You almost 
exploded over the phone when she called during cuddle time...&quot;

      Faye shook her head at the thought. Every once in a while, her and Erin just liked to 
lie together in bed and just... hold each other... then her cell phone rang, with a 
distraught Hoshi over the line. &quot;Half the problems she have are just burdens of guilt that 
she creates for herself anyway... plus all three of them are weird.&quot;

      The snake goddess nodded. &quot;Oh yes they are... I think Hina is the most normal. She 
isn&#39;t pushy, but she&#39;s pretty eager. She acts a bit immature, but she&#39;s frank about her 
feelings and what she wants, so that&#39;s good.&quot;

      &quot;Tsuki and Hoshi are nutcases,&quot; Faye said with a groan. &quot;Hoshi loves to tease her 
sisters to death, but when it comes down to it, she&#39;s too afraid of hurting her sisters so 
she won&#39;t touch them intimately beyond a little gropage.&quot; Dark just stared at the two, not 
quite understanding their conversation, but happily eating the food she was being provided.

      Faye just continued on her rant. &quot;And Tsuki, little miss &#39;I-need-more-time&#39; is too 
shy to come out and say what she wants, when she&#39;s actually the horniest of them all. 
Instead of being honest about it, she tries to trap her sisters in a situation where they 
have to be intimate...&quot;

      Erin began to laugh. &quot;I remember a lot of the ones Hoshi told us about... Tsuki 
claiming her breasts were sore and wanted them massaged... her robes accidentally falling 
open... sleep walking into her sisters&#39; rooms... purposefully getting all three of them 
locked in a closet... accidentally touching them inappropriately... having dubious training 
positions...&quot;

      &quot;I&#39;m just surprised Tsuru hasn&#39;t used her authority as their &#39;mistress&#39; to make them 
have sex together,&quot; Faye said with a snort. &quot;I&#39;m sure that would solve a majority of their 
issues. I bet it&#39;s driving Carmilla up a wall that the sisters constantly flirt with her 
little Tsuru.&quot;

      Erin was silent for a moment. &quot;Hmm... Tsuru could have her own harem, couldn&#39;t she?&quot;

      Faye pondered it and said, &quot;That would be horrible seeing as how she&#39;s dead set on 
finding the one woman she wants to be with...&quot;

      &quot;And Carmilla is dead set on being that woman, whether Tsuru likes it or not,&quot; Erin 
said with a giggle. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t know this much about the girls at that shrine, should 
we?&quot;

      Faye shrugged as Dark stopped eating, full of peaches. &quot;Well, Hoshi is the one that 
calls us... at least they&#39;re all bathing again, but something tells me that Hoshi would be 
the leader of harem, if anyone had to be it.&quot;

      Erin stood up and gave her lover a nudge in the shoulder. &quot;Really? I think you would 
be the one, actually.&quot; She motioned to Dark&#39;s still flushed face.

      Faye just shrugged. &quot;Quite frankly, I think we would be the leaders...&quot;

      The snake goddess looked over her shoulder as she put the jar back into the fridge. 
&quot;I wonder... have you ever had any experiences with harems...?&quot;

      Faye awkwardly turned away. &quot;Uh... let&#39;s just say that I would only do crazy stuff if 
you&#39;re there to do it with me...&quot;

      Erin sighed, disappointed. &quot;Too bad Dark&#39;s hurt, then and Hoshi and her sisters 
aren&#39;t around...&quot;

      Faye fidgeted in her chair, not sure if her lover was joking or not... maybe she 
really was a bad influence on Erin.
