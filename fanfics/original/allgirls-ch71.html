Gabrielle wore her very best dress, dark green and topless, and had her 
hair done by a professional, so intent was she on looking good for her 
girlfriend&#39;s birthday gala party. It was early January, not yet time for 
school to resume, so she would have to wear something warm once she was 
outside. Gabrielle was naturally anxious&#151;she had been anticipating this 
moment ever since she became Lilian&#39;s sweetheart and volunteered to be 
her date for the young woman&#39;s special day. Parties excited her and 
brought out the best in her, but from what Lilian had said, she had 
reason to be nervous.

The evening was going to be very formal and stuffy, probably with lots 
of very old people who had little to do with Lilian herself, and great 
expensive food Gabrielle couldn&#39;t even pronounce, with dancing, and 
German-speaking people everywhere. Lilian had been a good linguists 
teacher, but Gabrielle knew that all the help in the world wouldn&#39;t save 
her. And then there was Lilian&#39;s parents, the influential Nachtheims, 
noble by birth and profession. They barely tolerated Lilian, and only 
for the sake of keeping the family name. How adverse would they be to 
her girlfriend, whom they had never met? Gabrielle had to go to the 
bathroom twice, she drank so much tea. She always drank too much when 
she was nervous.

The doorbell rang. Lilian wanted to pick Gabrielle up personally, dear 
thing. She stood up quickly and raced downstairs, where the front door 
was. Smiling and smoothing her emerald dress out, she opened the 
door&#151;and stared. Lilian was breathtaking, her silvery hair tied up in a 
complex knot, her pale face glowing, her skin naked save for the elegant 
custom-made black dress that fitted her body. Lilian too blushed, unable 
to find the words to describe her gorgeous escort.

&quot;You look...amazing,&quot; managed O&#39;Shannon. Lilian nodded and whispered 
something in German. Gabrielle&#39;s father came into the room, armed with a 
camera, and asked the girls to pose together. Lilian closed the door, 
shivering from the cold and snow already, and stood in the welcoming 
room with her hand intertwined with Gabrielle&#39;s. They smiled as the 
camera flashed, capturing the moment for posterity.

&quot;Thanks. Have a good time, girls. Gab, don&#39;t forget to call when you&#39;re 
ready to come home.&quot;

&quot;Gotcha. Later, pa.&quot;

It had been the first time Gabrielle rode in a limousine, so she wanted 
to relish the experience. She got her chance&#151;Lilian&#39;s estate, or the 
part that would play host to her birthday, was a long way off.

Gabrielle couldn&#39;t help but gasp in awe as the limo finally arrived 
(Lilian seemed bored, of course, more occupied with Gabrielle herself). 
The house was nearly a mansion, and from her angle, Gabrielle could 
already make out an outdoor and indoor pool, a tennis court, an 
all-purpose range (which had once been the sight of a great polo game), 
a large greenhouse, and a garage big enough to hold several cars. A long 
line of automobiles clogged the driveway, but the limo brought the girls 
to center stage, dropping them off and wheeling away elsewhere. 
Gabrielle smiled as Lilian quietly took her hand and escorted her out of 
the car and up the stairs to her home. A crowd of people converged 
around her, babbling in German; she shied away.

&quot;Please, schatz, don&#39;t leave my side tonight.&quot;

&quot;Trust me, I won&#39;t. Not for all the chocolate in...you-know-where!&quot; 
Lilian laughed quietly, and leaned in to sneak a quick kiss on the dear 
girl&#39;s cheek. They came into the manor and wound their way to the large 
ballroom, where much of the evening&#39;s activity would take place. 
Gabrielle felt like a fairy-tale princess as she wandered in, beautiful 
Lilian clasping her hand and the air clasping everything else. Oh the 
opulence, the splendor, the grandeur! She stood gaping long enough to be 
ushered aside; she and Lilian made their way to a corner.

&quot;Wow!&quot; hissed O&#39;Shannon, and not for the first or last time. &quot;Wow! This 
is incredible! Lil, I had no idea...!&quot;

&quot;I hate it,&quot; snorted the albino, squeezing her girlfriend&#39;s hand 
tighter. &quot;This is all so foolish. All this splendor is for me, yet 
nobody truly cares. Except you,&quot; she remedied peacefully. Gabrielle 
smiled sadly.

&quot;Well it&#39;s a hell of a ball regardless. Why don&#39;t you at least try to 
enjoy it?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I could do that.&quot;

&quot;Come on!&quot; she squealed, guiding the taller woman to the floor. &quot;We 
gotta at least dance!&quot;

&quot;Nein, schatz, ich...&quot; Stuttering in her own tongue, Lilian stumbled as 
she followed the energetic redhead to the floor, and came to a halt in 
the dead center. Gabrielle beamed up at her, placed a tender kiss on her 
chin, and took her hands in a waltz. If anybody noticed the two ladies 
dancing together, they didn&#39;t pay any mind, and if they did, it wouldn&#39;t 
matter anyway, not to them. Lilian lost herself as she closed her eyes 
and shared a movement with the girl she loved, the one she cherished 
most, her dear savior and wonderful friend, both dancing on clouds.

Their exchange was interrupted all too soon by a tall, handsome, 
happy-looking man.

&quot;Pardon me,&quot; he said in German, &quot;but would you happen to be the young 
Madame Nachtheim?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Lilian said, her hands still attached to Gabrielle&#39;s.

&quot;I am glad to meet you,&quot; he said, bowing. &quot;Young Miss Nachtheim, my name 
is Josef. Would you do me the honor of having this next dance?&quot;

&quot;No thanks, I already have a partner.&quot; Josef looked to Gabrielle, who 
seemed lost. Of course, she could barely pick up anything in their 
conversation.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t kid me like that, Miss Nachtheim!&quot; laughed the man. He 
gently pried Lilian away from Gabrielle, but was at least polite enough 
to excuse himself. Poor Gabrielle watched helplessly as the woman she 
loved, eighteen years old that very day, was taken from her. She was 
left by herself just like that, forced to stand idly by and let other 
people, perfect strangers whom Lilian wanted little to do with, steal 
her away. She quietly hid herself at the food table and scoured it for 
something to drink. The combined body heat of the ballroom had made even 
the early January frost turn warm.

As she wandered around aimlessly, keeping an eye on Lilian dancing 
numbly, she tried looking for the girl&#39;s parents. She watched for people 
who seemed to be in the center of attention, but everyone was like that! 
Flocks of bodies, most of them old enough to pass as her parents, were 
everywhere, not a one distinguishable from the other. Aside from Lilian, 
there weren&#39;t any girls her age around, although there were plenty of 
men&#151;probably young people the Nachtheims had called up to ask if they&#39;d 
be interested in marrying their aloof daughter. Small chance of that 
happening.

Gabrielle wanted to squeeze in at least one dance, but Lilian had become 
an unwilling belle of the ball. It was like she was being gang-raped 
with waltzes and upbeat tangos; Gabrielle wished she could just scream, 
grab her beloved, and whisk her away for a real party. She began to 
understand why her girlfriend had despised this party so much (as she 
drank her third cup of punch). She frowned and wished there was 
something she could do.

A voice called out to her in German, making her turn. Of all things, it 
was a young lady&#151;older even than Lilian, but still in her youth! 
Gabrielle sighed and felt better already, even though she&#39;d never 
understand the girl. Her mere presence was enough. This young woman, 
dressed in a pink and white dress, took hold of the redhead&#39;s arms and 
smiled broadly. She continued to babble, to O&#39;Shannon&#39;s disappointment.

&quot;Whoa, wait, I don&#39;t understand!&quot; she managed. &quot;Uh...ich nein 
Deutschlander, ich...Irish/American.&quot;

&quot;Irish/American?&quot; mimed the lady, looking confused. She smiled, and in a 
light accent, managed to drawl in English: &quot;I speak no England.&quot; They 
both smiled sadly. Gabrielle figured if she couldn&#39;t understand the 
older girl, the least she could do was be polite.

&quot;Oh, okay. Um...that&#39;s all right. It&#39;s fine by me.&quot; She smiled and 
nodded her head, and the woman did the same.

&quot;Ja, ja,&quot; she said, and went off into a string of words Gabrielle had no 
hope of understanding. She grabbed the girl&#39;s arm despite her protest 
and ran off, away from the dancing and away from poor Lilian, to a 
balcony that overlooked the freezing Nachtheim compound. Gabrielle 
shivered until the girl placed an arm around her shoulder and smiled, 
trying to warm her body and soul.

Uh-oh. I wonder if she has a crush on me. Curse these Germans and their 
attraction to redheads! Or am I just that charming?

&quot;Danke shoen,&quot; managed Gabrielle, feeling a bit warmer already. The 
woman beamed.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome!&quot;

&quot;Glad you know that at least,&quot; she muttered. The girl soon introduced 
herself in her light accent, pointing to her chest: &quot;Gretel.&quot;

&quot;Gabrielle,&quot; answered the redhead. They shook hands and smiled. They 
lapsed into an awkward &quot;conversation&quot;, neither understanding the other, 
yet aside from her brief time with Lilian, Gabrielle was having the most 
fun of the evening. About midway into their third attempt at a 
conversation, O&#39;Shannon noticed the music and dancing had stopped, and 
wanted to excuse herself to see Lilian. There was no need: Nachtheim 
found her instead, and smiled softly as she stepped out on the balcony, 
her skin freezing already.

&quot;It looks like you two have the right idea,&quot; she said in both English 
and German. Gretel smiled and curtsied, knowing exactly who this was, 
and honored from the visit. Gabrielle embraced her, weary from such a 
foreign encounter.

&quot;Lil, can ya please translate for me? I don&#39;t understand a word poor 
Gretel&#39;s saying!&quot; Lilian smiled and informed Gretel of the situation; 
she laughed and performed another curtsey, then spoke freely. Lilian 
interpreted for them both:

&quot;She says she saw you lonely and was glad another girl her age was 
there. She wants to be friends.&quot;

&quot;Oh! So is that all? Tell her I&#39;d love to.&quot; Lilian did so, and even 
added in that she and Gabrielle were in love. Gretel looked amazed at 
this, but grinned widely.

&quot;She says we could make quite a nice couple,&quot; said Lilian humbly. &quot;And 
she didn&#39;t even know I was like that. It&#39;s so cold out here, schatz,&quot; 
she shivered, changing the subject; &quot;can we please go back inside?&quot;

&quot;Gladly!&quot; The trio went indoors, where the guests turned to smile at 
Lilian. She shyly waved at them and took Gabrielle by the hand across 
the ballroom floor. She stopped in front of an older couple who were 
engaged in conversation, and waited politely for them. Gabrielle guessed 
they were Lilian&#39;s parents, and was right. She gulped and hoped she 
could remember her German greetings.

&quot;Mother, father,&quot; said Lilian to them in German once they noticed her, 
&quot;I want to introduce you to my girlfriend, Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon. Please 
say hello.&quot; The two older people gazed at her sternly, as she knew they 
would, and poor Gabrielle could barely squeak.

&quot;Guten aben, herr und frau! Es ist mir eine Freude sie endlich 
kennenzulernen!&quot; They smiled and replied back, in German, forcing her to 
wince. &quot;Uh, sorry. That&#39;s about all I know. But it&#39;s really great to 
meet&#39;cha.&quot;

&quot;You seem polite,&quot; noted Mrs. Nachtheim dryly in English. Gabrielle 
breathed with relief, remembering Lilian&#39;s family was bilingual. The 
matron then added airily, &quot;I was not aware of my daughter&#39;s...interest 
in women. Nor of anything else for the matter. After all we do for her.&quot; 
Lilian protested in German; Gabrielle was soon glad she could not 
understand them. They argued hotly, drawing the attention of most of the 
guests. Mr. Nachtheim eventually quelled the storm, but only at the 
expense of his standing. He didn&#39;t want to be embarrassed, not in front 
of all those people.

Then to Gabrielle, &quot;What makes you think you&#39;re good enough for my 
daughter?&quot;

&quot;We love each other fine. If Lilian says so&#151;&quot;

&quot;What could you possibly give her that any of these young men could 
not?&quot;

&quot;I just...love her, is all. That&#39;s all she really wants.&quot;

&quot;And who do you think knows her better, a common girl like you or her 
own family?&quot;

&quot;Father!!&quot;

&quot;Silence, Lilian! You shouldn&#39;t have brought her here.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s my party, though I never asked for any of this, and she&#39;s my 
girlfriend, and she is...always...too good for me! I don&#39;t see how I 
deserve her, so don&#39;t think for a moment she&#39;s not good enough for me! I 
love her!&quot; By now Lilian was crying, out of rage and sadness. Her father 
growled angrily and looked ready to slap her. Had she just proclaimed 
her homosexuality in German, in front of all those important people who 
would look down on such a thing...

&quot;Enough!&quot; said her mother firmly. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be arguing. Let Lilian 
do as she wishes. After all, this is her coming-of-age party. If she 
wants to disappoint us by romancing a commoner and a girl, so be it. You 
are now responsible for your own actions, young lady.&quot;

&quot;That, mother,&quot; whispered Lilian chillingly, &quot;is the best present you 
could possibly give me. I thank you.&quot; Mrs. Nachtheim frowned 
disapprovingly, and left with her husband in arm. Lilian sighed, whether 
from a released weight or an added one, and was quickly attended by 
Gabrielle, who held her and kissed her naked white shoulders.

&quot;Ich liebe dich, schatz.&quot; She looked up and smiled; Lilian sighed sadly 
and embraced the wonderful woman. They touched noses, ignoring the 
onlookers, and kissed.

&quot;I never taught you that.&quot;

&quot;I know. I wanted to learn it myself.&quot; Lilian smiled and kissed her 
again.

&quot;I love you too.&quot;

&quot;Mm. Hey, wanna blow this joint? Maybe rent a hotel somewhere, stay 
there the night?&quot;

&quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;

&quot;Will it be okay for you to leave here so suddenly?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; she laughed. &quot;Like they said, I&#39;m emancipated. I take care 
of myself now. I&#39;ll have a stupid fortune by the time we get back to 
school, my inheritance, and of course I shall always have you, the only 
thing I really want.&quot; Gabrielle blushed humbly, biting her lip for joy, 
and followed the newly-crowned adult woman outside her manor, where they 
ignored onlookers and photographers, men and women, even Gretel herself 
(who shouted out to them a call of good luck), as they hid themselves in 
a limousine and asked to be taken to a nice hotel.

They kissed and held each other the whole ride over.

&quot;Happy Birthday, sweetheart.&quot;

&quot;Only with you here, my love.&quot;

.........

The two couldn&#39;t stop smiling as they checked in, still dressed in their 
evening gowns, and kept grinning as the bellhop showed them to their 
rooms and left them with a smile. Gabrielle let out a merry laugh as she 
whirled into the room, her green dress billowing like a flower caught in 
the wind. Lilian watched the vision of loveliness twirl, and waited for 
her to stop before approaching her, kissing her once, and taking her 
into her arms.

&quot;Dance with me,&quot; she begged gently, &quot;as we should have danced back 
then.&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; And oh, how the floor did rejoice as the feet of the two 
lovebirds glided across its furry carpet, fluidly and slowly, stealing 
tender kisses and whispering so softly their devotion for each other&#151;how 
deeply they loved one another. Gabrielle winced happily as she felt 
Lilian&#39;s ghostly pink lips touch her collarbone, and sighed as the woman 
placed her hand against her cheek. The red and green eyes could stare at 
each other night and day and know no other happiness, nor want any. 
Gabrielle&#39;s heart began to thud stronger and louder for some 
reason&#151;perhaps Lilian&#39;s perfume, or her delicate, shy smile. Maybe 
because she was ethereal, or because she loved her so much, or perhaps 
because she looked really sexy in black.

She reached behind her, bending her arms crookedly, and unzipped her 
dress. Without averting her gaze from Lilian&#39;s heartbreaking smile, she 
let the garment fall, and stood naked save for the modest cotton 
underwear over her hips. Lilian breathed hard, amazed that this beauty 
could turn more beautiful, that such a thing could exist and love her so 
much. She fumbled with the black straps of her dress, wanting to be 
naked for her love; they fell to the floor and joined the green 
material.

Soon white and pink too joined; lips descended with tender loving care; 
hands found every naked, fleshly spot a pleasure; breathing magnified, 
pulses soared. Gabrielle saw spots as Lilian knelt and sweetly kissed 
her protruding bosom. Lilian wept and called out the name of her beloved 
as she dipped her tongue into the older girl&#39;s belly button. They took 
turns prying the last remnants of covering from their bodies, and that 
night gave themselves to each other, blissfully making sweet love, until 
every barrier was down, every declaration had been made, every tear wept 
and every square inch kissed and touched and loved, beautiful.

But best of all, according to Gabrielle, tomorrow would be even better.

Next time: Lilian gets a REAL birthday celebration! Mmm...chocolate 
party cake...</pre>
