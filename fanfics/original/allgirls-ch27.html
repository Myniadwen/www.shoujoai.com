<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>&quot;Erica and Alisha Do Stanton&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;cha get?&quot; Alisha Fox sat down next to her younger sister Erica. 
She sighed.

&quot;I really don&#39;t think we&#151;&quot;

&quot;Oh hush, let me see.&quot; Erica grabbed the short list of names before her 
sister could react, and scanned down them quickly, saying nothing but 
&quot;Uh-huh&quot; and &quot;Ah&quot;, or &quot;I see!&quot; along the way. Erica frowned.

&quot;Give it back.&quot; She reached for it, but like a brat, Alisha held it 
away.

&quot;Say please.&quot;

&quot;Alisha, please give it back.&quot; The elder Fox grinned and slapped her 
sister with the paper, then delivered it. Erica gave her an injured pout 
and clutched the paper more securely. Alisha was already digging for 
hers.

&quot;So, explain,&quot; she said, her eyes averted. Erica grumbled. This was so 
beneath her dignity. But at least she had her sister&#39;s attention. And 
they could talk about something they had in common, for once.

&quot;All right. From top to bottom. Olivia Johnson: she&#39;s very 
beautiful&#151;hot, you&#39;d say&#151;but she always looks forlorn. She&#39;s got a bad 
leg and she keeps mostly to herself, or else four close friends of hers. 
I&#39;d say there&#39;s low potential.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t think you&#39;d like her?&quot; Erica blushed.

&quot;I might...&quot;

&quot;So go after her. Who&#39;s next?&quot;

&quot;June Tramble, that girl in a wheelchair.&quot;

&quot;Oh yeah, I know her. Real sweet, bit of a recluse. She&#39;s more your 
type.&quot; Erica blushed again.

&quot;And Alexis Walker... you can tell she&#39;s gay a mile away. But she hasn&#39;t 
had luck with women recently, so I&#39;ve heard. More your type.&quot;

&quot;Music-lover?&quot;

&quot;Uh... I&#39;ll have to check in on that. After her is Victoria Grissom. 
She&#39;s definitely a lesbian; I hear she and Olivia used to be an item. 
She&#39;s quiet, but not too shy, and she&#39;s really sweet.&quot;

&quot;You know, Ricki,&quot; said Alisha, using a name she knew her sister hated, 
&quot;you can&#39;t fall in love with every girl in Stanton.&quot;

&quot;I know!&quot; barked Erica defensively. &quot;I&#39;m just saying what I&#39;ve 
observed&#151;and besides, this was your idea! So you tell me who you have!&quot;

&quot;I asked you first.&quot;

&quot;Well it&#39;s your turn now.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; huffed Alisha, scrolling her finger down her own list. She had 
several people on her list who were also on Erica&#39;s; they even had a 
class together. She read randomly, unlike her more organized sibling: 
&quot;Janine Bautista, pretty but straight. Vehemently so. May Tramble, 
June&#39;s sister. Also straight. Farrah Kwong, cute but straight; Avelina 
Rohani, creepy and straight. Jocelyn McKeough&#151;&quot;

&quot;Straight,&quot; grumbled Erica, &quot;I get the idea.&quot; Alisha smirked.

&quot;Hero Love,&quot; she resumed, and with a raised eyebrow, sang out the word, 
&quot;bisexual. Kathlyn Parkin&#151;unknown. Vai Knox&#151;also unknown. Mira van Dijk, 
little miss Krishnan, and Blake Baum, all taken&#151;by each other.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. And I get the point. I guess if you&#39;re going to be a 
brat about it&#151;&quot;

&quot;Amina Washim,&quot; interrupted Alisha, and with a saucy smile, she 
declared, &quot;single&#151;sexual preference unknown.&quot;

A pause. Erica sighed.

&quot;Maybe we should just think about the girls who are both single and 
homosexual. I mean, I know you&#39;ll say that&#39;s hard in this school, but 
with your list and mine, we&#39;ve got a good mix. Let&#39;s pool together what 
we know in one column, what we believe in another, and whatever we have 
reason to doubt in the third. You know, I cannot believe you are even 
getting me into this.&quot;

&quot;You want a girlfriend, right?&quot;

&quot;More than anything.&quot;

&quot;And big sister knows well, right?&quot;

&quot;On occasion.&quot;

&quot;So trust me. This helps us both.&quot; Alisha smiled again, which forced 
Erica to sigh. Strange it was between the Fox sisters, for if one was in 
a pleasant mood, chances were that the other was not. They combined 
their knowledge for this endeavor, though, and once they were both 
finished, the end result looked something like this:

Confirmed: Alexis Walker, Victoria Grissom, Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon, Ivory 
Tran, Ayanna Montgomery, Miss Johansson, Ms. Cerio, F. Hail, Miss 
Raulson

Possible: Zane Klein, Olivia Johnson, Rai Zanders, Ancelin Yi, Ms. 
Keeping, Ms. Post, Amina Washim, Hero Love, Leena K., Ms. Madsen

Doubtful: June Tramble, Vai Knox, Katt Parkin, Lilian Nactheim, Nomi 
Nakatori, Ana Lu, Mrs. Keys, HM, Miss O&#39;Brien, Corona Marcos

No chance in Hell (taken or straight): Mira van Dijk, Usha Krishnan, 
Blake Baum, Miss McGowen, Farrah Kwong, Avelina Rohani, AT, May Tramble, 
Jocelyn McKeough, Janine Bautista

For the most part, the Fox sisters were pretty accurate in their 
assumptions, although far from perfect. The teachers were the hardest to 
tell, of course, and plenty of girls who were under &quot;Doubtful&quot; were 
either still in &quot;the closet&quot;, undecided, or otherwise unknown. The two 
girls scanned over the names several times, paying close attention to 
those near the top first, and mulled over the results for a few minutes.

&quot;Why&#39;d you put Ana Lu in &#39;Doubtful&#39;?&quot; asked Erica.

&quot;Why? Is there something wrong? She&#39;s too blonde and ditzy to be gay.&quot;

&quot;Mihoshi,&quot; spoke her sister, and that was all she needed to say. Alisha 
frowned.

&quot;Oh yeah... but she was the exception.&quot;

&quot;I think we all know that Rai Zanders may as well have the name &#39;Kiyone&#39; 
sewn to her shirt.&quot; Alisha nearly chuckled out loud.

&quot;Rai?? The half-geek, half-jock would-be bishounen? No way.&quot;

&quot;Ana clings to her like it&#39;s the end of the world. And not to sound 
lewd, but I spotted them kissing.&quot;

&quot;Get out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m serious.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; muttered her sister playfully, &quot;I mean outta the closet, you&#39;re 
not nearly gay enough.&quot; Erica rolled her eyes and looked like she was 
about to leave. Alisha stopped her and apologized&#151;but just then, as fate 
would have it, Ana Lu walked past them, chipper and wary of things as 
always. It was the perfect time to confirm things.

&quot;Oh, Ana!&quot; Only Alisha had class with Ana, so she called out and was 
answered with said blonde-ditzy smile. She pointed to her sister and 
said, &quot;Ricki here&#39;s wondering what&#39;s the deal with you. We&#39;re kind of 
undergoing a private survey in this school and we were wondering, 
between the girls in all our classes and anyone else we could think of, 
who was gay and who wasn&#39;t. I mean, we&#39;re both single and looking, so&#151;&quot;

&quot;Oh, well, don&#39;t come looking for me, because I&#39;m already taken!&quot;

&quot;See?&quot; grunted Erica, jabbing her sister softly. &quot;I told you.&quot;

&quot;Hush, you said nothing. So Ana,&quot; she resumed, &quot;confirm it for us: are 
you straight?&quot;

&quot;Uh... hee-hee, nope! I used to be!&quot;

&quot;Oh. So... you&#39;re gay?&quot;

&quot;Um, not really.&quot;

&quot;Ah, bisexual!&quot; Ana smiled brightly and giggled.

&quot;No, no!&quot; The sisters looked at each other, puzzled.

&quot;Then what&#39;s left? Are you asexual?&quot;

&quot;Of course not!&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;m Raisexual!&quot;

Naturally, the Fox sisters stared at her.

&quot;What does that&#151;&quot; Before they could even finish, their question was 
broken off by a husky &quot;Hey&quot;, a sharp shriek and giggle, and two arms 
wrapping themselves around Ana&#39;s stomach from behind. Lu jerked around 
and stood on her toes to kiss, of course, Rai Zanders, leaving Alisha to 
remain gaped. Erica smiled coolly.

&quot;As I was saying&#151;&quot; A sharp finger cut her off instantly.

&quot;You say anything else, and I swear I&#39;ll beat you.&quot;

&quot;I know you won&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I swear I will!&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t,&quot; insisted Erica calmly. Ana, who had been busily engaged 
with her girlfriend, turned around and smiled at the two.

&quot;So like, are you two a couple? Cuz&#39; you sure fight like one.&quot; Both 
sisters froze just long enough to grimace.

&quot;Gag! We&#39;re sisters!&quot; Ana Lu smiled and shrugged, her neck covered by 
Zanders&#39; mouth.

&quot;So?&quot;

............

In truth, Erica Fox already had a crush on one of her classmates, and 
when Alisha mentioned her&#151;or rather, emphasized her name with unusual 
care and uncanny insight&#151;she had to force herself not to react. She only 
shared one class with her, and had known her faintly for only a month, 
but there was still a slight, innocent, healthy attraction. She was a 
first-year student, young and shy and hardly inclined to speak, but very 
wise in mathematics and quite a good person to study with. Erica didn&#39;t 
know her well enough to know her faults; she just knew that she liked 
her. Amina Washim. The name of the girl she liked was Amina Washim. She 
had been categorized as &quot;Possible&quot;.

The Fox sisters, Alisha the senior and Erica the sophomore, had known 
about their attraction to the same sex since their days of middle 
school, when their identities came out along with... other things. The 
two had been different since birth, and kept their distances further and 
further apart until they might as well have been on opposite sides of a 
canyon.

Alisha was taller and slimmer, and she had dyed her hair black with blue 
stripes here and there, further causing a rift from her sister, whose 
hair was like copper and in two braids. The elder Fox dressed in leather 
and piercing, and wore either light or dark makeup, depending on her 
mood. She had a punkish look to her, but she was musically inclined like 
a siren and knew how to use her mouth and ears well. She was also 
hostile at times, untrustworthy and shy, easily angered and not one to 
stay calm for long.

Were it not for their sisterly bond, Erica would&#39;ve been just her 
sister&#39;s type: Alisha was intensely attracted to her &quot;opposites&quot;, and 
Erica was that. She wore very ordinary clothes that did not make her 
stand out, nor did she bother to present herself as anything more than 
she was. Slightly overweight and insecure about it (and more), Erica was 
not talkative and trusted people too much (hence, her sister caused her 
immense grief). Her mind was sharper than shark&#39;s teeth, as her writing 
suggested, and she was sensitive to others, strong of will, helpful, and 
outspoken in spite of her shy appearance. Alisha didn&#39;t qualify for her 
type; she sought those with personality, with cheer, with a mind.

&quot;She&#39;s cute,&quot; crooned Alisha as a polite-looking young lady strolled 
their way. Poor Erica frowned and looked down; she was hardly the sexual 
type and, though as romantic as her sister, she could not bring herself 
to promiscuity or even hasty acquaintanceship. Alisha puffed out her 
chest like a rooster and strutted towards this newest chick. Erica 
rolled her eyes, but sweet justice prevailed. The cute girl was not gay.

&quot;Sister,&quot; spoke she, hardly keeping her smile secret. Alisha scowled.

&quot;Shut up. I can&#39;t be right every time.&quot;

&quot;Your gaydar is broken.&quot;

&quot;No it&#39;s not!&quot;

&quot;Not that there&#39;s any such thing,&quot; noted the younger, holding her head 
up proudly. &quot;These days&#151;well, in all days, you just cannot tell simply 
by appearance and action. To know someone&#39;s sexual orientation is like 
knowing what is inside a birthday present: the wrapping paper cannot 
suggest anything.&quot;

&quot;But like a good present,&quot; added her sister with a cattily raised brow, 
&quot;one must unwrap a woman to see her interior.&quot;

&quot;Sick,&quot; she sighed, sulking. Alisha laughed.

&quot;I haven&#39;t disrobed that many women in my life. Three or four. And you?&quot;

Erica kept silent and hugged her books as she walked. Her sister knew 
the answer to that question.

&quot;Let&#39;s see... since you came out in 7th grade, you&#39;ve seen... how many 
women naked? Should I count the ones in the locker room&#151;or myself? How 
about kisses? Dates? Hands held? Boobies smushed into thy face&#151;&quot;

&quot;I get it!!&quot; Erica rarely shrieked, unless when her sister was around. 
Living with the smaller, younger, plumper offspring of her parents for 
six and ten years had enabled Alisha to discern which buttons produced 
which emotional outburst. And she had pushed a big, red, shiny one.

&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; she said in defense, &quot;no need to get uppity. It&#39;s your 
life I&#39;m talking about.&quot;

&quot;Alisha, be quiet.&quot; Erica snorted and quickened. Her sister could be so 
offensive. The elder Fox smiled, but sensed that she had really pushed 
the poor girl too far this time. She needed to make it up to her, and if 
she knew her sister&#151;if she had read her face properly, seen her eyes 
dart in that certain way&#151;she knew what, or rather who, could ease her.

&quot;Hey, Ricki,&quot; she called out, but Erica was mute. &quot;Ricki, come on. I&#39;m 
sorry, okay? You just look so cute when you&#39;re mad sometimes&#151;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m hurt, Leesh!&quot; she snapped, not turning around.

&quot;Okay. I&#39;m sorry I hurt you. Slug me if you want.&quot; Erica stopped, jerked 
around, and marched over to her sister. Violence was not her way, it was 
Alisha&#39;s, but when it was offered... She forced her fist into her older 
sister&#39;s shoulder once, giving it a good sting, then slapped her hands 
over both her cheeks and kissed her square on the mouth.

&quot;Bitch,&quot; she sighed. All was forgiven.

.........

Alisha didn&#39;t mind rubbing her sister&#39;s feet, but she had to do it so 
much. It was Erica&#39;s fault, really. Every time she even suspected 
somebody of teasing her, she would take it personally and pout about it. 
The girl was too insecure about herself to tell the difference, and 
despite her will-and-want, her sensitivity proved to be both strength 
and weakness&#151;and nobody knew how to exploit that like her sister. Foot 
rubs were the epitome of retribution between the Fox sisters, and since 
Alisha offended far more than her sister, she was used to the sole and 
heel and toes. Erica was not ticklish down there.

&quot;Sister can tell Alisha,&quot; she said gently, kneading weary little 
foot-muscles as Erica ate popcorn and read Jung. Crunch, crunch, 
swallow, pause.

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna.&quot;

&quot;Alisha will keep it secret.&quot;

&quot;From whom? Not miss lucky. Alisha will tell object of sister&#39;s 
affection of sister&#39;s thoughts.&quot;

&quot;Would harm come of it?&quot; she asked, wiggling a small toe. Erica winced 
in pleasure.

&quot;Mph, if she&#39;s like that cute girl you saw, verily.&quot;

&quot;Know ye this pixie?&quot;

&quot;I have her in math class.&quot;

&quot;Then I know her as well. Her name, sister?&quot;

&quot;Not telling.&quot; Alisha lightly drew her fingernail over the sole. It 
didn&#39;t tickle, but Erica still hissed.

&quot;I&#39;ll guess, sister, and I won&#39;t guess wrong.&quot;

&quot;Just try. And stop talking, I have to study. Miss Keeping is having a 
quiz tomorrow.&quot; Alisha smiled, bent over, and kissed the foot&#151;what they 
both knew to be the highest form of humility. The foot was much lower 
than the buttocks, and could sometimes smell worse.

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; she mused to herself a moment later. &quot;Based on the kind of 
girl you like, I can narrow it down to a few. The only question that 
remains is, whether or not you like older or younger women.&quot; Erica 
decided to throw her sister a small bone.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; she murmured airily. Alisha blurted out a name.

&quot;Nomi.&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot; Good. She&#39;s the one I like.

&quot;Hero.&quot;

&quot;Too wild.&quot; She had a point.

&quot;Vai.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t know her very well.&quot;

&quot;Katt.&quot; A pause. Alisha grinned and wiggled another toe. &quot;Is it Katt 
Parkin?&quot;

&quot;...No comment.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll put that in the &#39;maybe&#39; file. Now, let&#39;s see... um... Lilian?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Amina?&quot; Another pause. Erica grumbled.

&quot;This is stupid.&quot;

&quot;Another &#39;maybe&#39;. Let&#39;s see... oh! Miss Cerio! She&#39;s very sexy, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Alisha!!&quot; Incensed, Erica rolled her upper body around until she faced 
her older sibling, losing her place and some of her popcorn. &quot;She&#39;s the 
teacher, for crying out loud!&quot;

&quot;I heard she bangs students.&quot; Erica snorted.

&quot;That&#39;s gross. She hasn&#39;t done you, has she?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; was said casually, and then, &quot;not yet.&quot;

&quot;Ew.&quot;

&quot;What? She&#39;s hot!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s wrong. God, wait for graduation before you do something like 
that!&quot; Alisha smiled, but not cruelly like she had earlier, and rubbed 
her sister&#39;s generous bottom.

&quot;Of course, sweet cheeks!!&quot; she sang. Erica swatted her hand away.

&quot;Stop it, pervert. And for your knowledge, I don&#39;t have a crush on you, 
if you were to ask.&quot; Alisha just smiled and tilted her head, making 
dyed-black and blue hair fall.

&quot;Darn.&quot; Erica snorted. &quot;Anyway, it&#39;s down to two. I think you&#39;d look 
very cute with either Katt or Amina in your arms. They both seem to be 
your type&#151;uh, where ya goin&#39;?&quot;

&quot;To the bathroom.&quot; Erica forced herself out of the couch and stomped 
over to one of the two Fox bathrooms.

&quot;What for, padding or peeing?&quot;

&quot;Privacy.&quot; Thud. Alisha frowned.

&quot;Jeez... sorry for winning Bitch of the Year Award.&quot;

Tick, tick, tick&#151;ten minutes. Life was more dull without Erica to tease. 
Too bad she couldn&#39;t loosen up and smile at herself more often. Not for 
the first time, Alisha wished she had been given a cooler sister all 
those years ago. Erica was beautiful in her own way and smart, which was 
better than having neither trait, so it was some blessing to have two 
out of three. Still, an unattractive, unintelligent cool little sister 
sounded nice.

She hoped Nomi Nakatori was cool, because at that point in her life, 
Alisha had an impressive crush on the young girl, and not without 
reason. Nomi was a musician, a dead good one, and&#151;

Flush. Click. Swing. Thump, thump, thump&#151;Erica was back. Alisha waved.

&quot;Hey. Pax? Slug me if you will.&quot; Erica punched the other shoulder, gave 
her sister another kiss, and forgave her. Whatever she was, she could 
not stay entirely mad at any person for a long time, and besides, at 
least Alisha tried to patch things up instead of staying stubborn, 
though that too was sometimes a fault. Erica sat next to her on the 
couch, and leaned her copper hair and head against her shoulder. Their 
hands entwined.

&quot;If you must know,&quot; she murmured, &quot;I like Amina.&quot;

&quot;I was right. Well, sort of. Anyway, I&#39;m glad you finally fessed up. 
Naturally, I&#39;ll have to try and hook the two&#151;&quot;

&quot;No, don&#39;t,&quot; insisted her sister, the voice coming out strong. &quot;I want 
to do it myself. Big sister cannot be such a slave, no matter how much I 
love her effort. Erica will just have to gather her guts and go for 
broke.&quot;

&quot;Good.&quot; She combed the rusted locks of silk with curved fingers, and 
kissed the head, and squeezed her hand. &quot;If she accepts, and what girl 
would be crazy enough to turn down my little sister, maybe we can go on 
a double-date.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have a girlfriend.&quot; Alisha grinned.

&quot;Not yet.&quot; A pause.

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;Nomi.&quot;

&quot;From math class.&quot; A nod. &quot;Ho, boy. This may get awkward.&quot;

&quot;Hush, it&#39;ll be fun. And you&#39;ve never had a date, so you don&#39;t know.&quot; 
Erica decided it was as close to a compliment she would get that day, so 
she curled herself further into her sister&#39;s embrace and looked up, into 
the wild and caring, altogether annoying face. She reached up and 
touched her cheek, saying nothing. Erica Fox was only quiet because, 
unlike her sister, she was proficient in the rare, difficult art of 
silent communication. And she was saying Thanks, among other things.</pre>
