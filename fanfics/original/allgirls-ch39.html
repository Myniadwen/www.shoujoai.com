<a href="../original/allgirls-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><pre>&quot;May and October&quot;

Avelina Rohani sat nervously across from her boyfriend, Ethan Nikholai, 
as he drove her to the auditorium. It was Saturday, the 2nd day of 
October, the first weekend of the autumnal month, and the perfect time 
to hold auditions for the school play and musical. Knowing his 
girlfriend had an excellent singing voice, Ethan tried again and again 
to convince her to audition, but Avelina kept on saying how badly she&#39;d 
do, how uncomfortable in front of audiences she was, and how she 
wouldn&#39;t know anybody there anyway.

&quot;It&#39;s a good way to make friends, Avi,&quot; he said as he paused at a red 
light. &quot;You already know you have something in common with them, so you 
can break the ice easily. And you promised me you&#39;d try and make friends 
while you&#39;re here.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t see the point,&quot; she murmured nonchalantly. &quot;With my luck, I&#39;ll 
move before the school year&#39;s halfway over. You&#39;ll keep in contact with 
me, right?&quot;

&quot;Avi, you won&#39;t move. I talked to your parents; they like it here. They 
want you to stay, I want you to stay. Now come on, you promised.&quot;

&quot;I did,&quot; she said with a faint smile, &quot;didn&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Yes. Will you?&quot; She sighed.

&quot;I&#39;ll try. But I&#39;m no good at it. I&#39;ll just sing or read some lines and 
wait for the results. Are you sure you can&#39;t stay and watch?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to, tulip, but duty calls. Unless you&#39;d like to walk, you 
should probably hitch a ride with someone there. Another great way to 
make friends.&quot; He spared her a grin and turned a corner. Stanton was not 
far. Avelina shrugged.

&quot;I guess. It&#39;s a pity, though... that I can&#39;t drive. Not legally and not 
realistically.&quot;

&quot;And I can&#39;t fly.&quot; She smiled and gave his cheek a soft kiss.

&quot;I love you, my beauty.&quot; He grinned.

&quot;Ah, who needs the sky when I&#39;ve got heaven right here?&quot; She giggled and 
jabbed his arm with her elbow. Ethan playfully told her to stop, 
signaled left, and drove into the student parking lot. Plenty of other 
cars were there, meaning Avelina would definitely have company for her 
audition. Ethan put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her in for a 
few kisses.

&quot;Good luck, sing well, make new friends. I mean it.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll try, dear. Um, Ethan, you got any time?&quot;

&quot;A bit, why?&quot;

&quot;I have something I&#39;d like to talk about.&quot; He turned off the car engine, 
twisted, and devoted his full attention to her. When people normally 
looked into her piercing, liquid-silvery eyes, they shied away, thinking 
her rude or blind or weird, but Ethan adored them. He made plain his 
love of her beautiful eyes, and stared so deep that Avelina knew he 
could see her soul, and fell in love with it. The mere thought made her 
melt and smile.

&quot;I know about the car, Nicky,&quot; she said gently, using a nickname of his. 
Ethan winced and looked away, but Avelina took his hand and smiled. 
&quot;Honey, don&#39;t worry about it. I overheard it from Ana and Rai. I&#39;m not 
upset, love, I&#39;m really not. As long as it runs, I don&#39;t care what it 
looks like or how many scars it has. Besides, I owe you.&quot;

&quot;Huh? How so?&quot; Her smile broadened as she placed her palm on his chest, 
over his oily overshirt he took to work.

&quot;Coffee,&quot; she answered. Ethan chuckled, took her hand and kissed it, and 
embraced her before saying farewell. When the car left the parking lot, 
Avelina felt loneliness and despair creep up on her. She held herself in 
the blowing wind and marched to the auditorium anxiously.

There were a lot of students inside, and not all of them were in Miss 
Post&#39;s class. There was Zane, Farrah, Alisha, and Ayanna; there was 
Janine, Hero, Blake, and Gabrielle; Miss Johansson and Miss Post were 
there, amongst many in the music and (yes) drama classes, and dozens 
more, some comparing the event to &quot;American Idol&quot;. Avelina took a very 
deep breath and tried to ignore the thudding in her ribs as she made her 
way forward.

At least she wasn&#39;t late. Students came in after her, and it looked as 
if Post and Johansson were still setting things up. Avelina lurched over 
to their table and cleared her throat to get her music teacher&#39;s 
attention.

&quot;Hi, Avelina! I was hoping you&#39;d show up! You know, I think you&#39;re a 
shoe-in for the musical.&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t auditioned yet,&quot; she said. She leaned over the table and 
asked, &quot;So what did you two finally decide on for the productions?&quot; 
Elspeth Post pointed to two sheets of rough drafts, each one contributed 
by a lucky student.

&quot;Well, Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon sent in a silly little thing she called, 
&#39;Jinx, Bullseye, and the Treasure of the Gold Mouse&#39;. Not very stirring, 
but the premise pulled Miss Johansson&#39;s heartstrings. She thinks you&#39;d 
be darling in it.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see. And the play?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s called &#39;Iz this Real?&#39;, I-Z, spelled in context. You may have a 
part in there as well.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll pass on the play,&quot; murmured Rohani. Post shrugged.

&quot;Your decision. Wait over there by the stage; we&#39;ll call you out when 
we&#39;re ready.&quot; Avelina obeyed and nestled in one of the audience chairs, 
sitting by herself as per normal. She observed the large, slightly dim 
school auditorium with boredom, waiting for things to start. With her 
name being in the second half of the alphabet, she knew she&#39;d be there 
for awhile, and as Ethan&#39;s words came to her, she considered doing the 
unthinkable and socializing. But with whom?

Most all the girls had friends with them. Avelina was poor in groups. 
She searched for a girl like her, alone and friendless, and found one 
moping by herself further down. She paused in thought. Nothing ventured, 
nothing gained. She stood and walked over, until she was hovering right 
above the lonely woman.

&quot;Can I sit here?&quot; she asked meekly. The young woman looked up and gave 
her a faint smile. Avelina descended and sighed. The woman next to her, 
slightly older and taller, wore an outfit very similar to Avelina&#39;s; 
that is, she preferred not standing out in the crowd. She had dark eyes, 
practically black, and skin like bronze, with hair as thick and dark as 
gooey tar covering her shoulders. The woman had a beauty to her that was 
different, fresh, familiar and foreign; she looked about as pleasant as 
Avelina herself.

&quot;What&#39;re you auditioning for?&quot; questioned Rohani.

&quot;Uhm... I may not actually go up. I kinda want to, but I&#39;m really shy on 
stage.&quot;

&quot;Me too. I know what that feels like. I&#39;m just going for the musical 
since Miss Johansson says I have a great voice. Um... I&#39;m Avelina. 
Sorry. I&#39;m bad at talking to people, and introductions, and social 
situations, and... well, lots of things.&quot; The young woman smiled with 
empathy and shook Avi&#39;s hand.

&quot;I&#39;m Vai. Actually, it&#39;s Vairocana, but everyone calls me Vai, even my 
parents. Well, when they call me anything, really.&quot;

&quot;Vairocana... That is an unusual name.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, no kidding.&quot;

&quot;Named after a... Hindu death goddess, right?&quot; Vai&#39;s eyes bulged open in 
surprise, since obviously she did not expect a stranger to know 
something like that.

&quot;Yeah, yeah! How&#39;d you know?&quot;

&quot;I like reading about names.&quot; Avelina gave her a creepy smile, but it 
didn&#39;t unsettle Vai.

&quot;Oh. Oh! Now I know you! You&#39;re in math class with me! That&#39;s 
right&#151;you&#39;re the genius.&quot;

&quot;Is that what people are saying?&quot; asked Avi, rather taken off guard. Vai 
shrugged.

&quot;Well, when one gets an A on Miss Cerio&#39;s trig quiz, one does not go 
unnoticed. Hey, maybe you can help me study! Lord knows I need it. I 
gotta wonder what I&#39;m doing in advanced math.&quot; Vai smiled with 
enthusiasm; Avi shied. She was excellent in math, this was true, and at 
times had to correct even Miss Cerio, who was hardly a stranger to tough 
numbers. But genius?

&quot;Only losers call other people a genius,&quot; she muttered. Vai barely heard 
it.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;Oh. I&#39;m talking to myself. I was just saying... it gets irritating 
being called a genius. People say &#39;she&#39;s special, she&#39;s different&#39;. As 
if they can&#39;t ever achieve the same thing through hard work. I just 
always liked numbers. I&#39;m drawn to them. It&#39;s very easy for me, but I 
still work hard. All you can do is your best. If you put everything you 
have into something, doesn&#39;t that make you a genius as well, even though 
somebody may be &#39;better&#39; than you?&quot;

Vai&#39;s eyes widened with surprise as she tried to express how impressed 
she was. She never expected a real conversation from a stranger, much 
less the quiet hermit Avi. Apparently the woman had a deep mind, and 
could think such things because, perhaps, she had more time to devote to 
them. Maybe a lack of friends helped...

&quot;You&#39;ve got a point.&quot;

&quot;So what&#39;re you genius at, Vai?&quot; asked Avelina, drilling her silvery 
eyes into the woman&#39;s face. Vai looked away from the dead gaze.

&quot;Uh, well, nothing special. I like to read and write, and do drama of 
course... but I hate getting up there, how ironic. I&#39;ve been known to 
debate a lot, and I&#39;m a bit photosensitive, which means&#151;&quot;

&quot;You see radiant energy.&quot; Avi gave another eerie smile and noted, &quot;I&#39;m 
dichromatic. That means&#151;&quot;

&quot;Partial blindness, only two colors are perceptible.&quot; Avelina nodded 
humbly.

&quot;Do you think I&#39;m a freak?&quot; Vai lowered her eyes and gave a very, very 
sad smile.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t. I&#39;m a much bigger freak. I&#39;m a masochist, and I&#39;m messed 
up, and I have two mothers.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re freaky,&quot; said Avelina quietly. It didn&#39;t sound insulting or 
complimentary; it was said as a note, an aside, to herself or to the 
air. She laughed and added, &quot;We both are. Our eyes make us freaks. Boy, 
my boyfriend was right. All I had to do was try and I could make 
friends.&quot;

&quot;You have a boyfriend?&quot; Avelina nodded and smiled very sweetly, looking 
normal for a change.

&quot;Yes, Ethan Petrov Nikholai, the world&#39;s greatest mortal man. My love 
and beauty, my knight, the thud in my heart and the sweetness of a long 
sleep after a hard day of toil and stress.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Lucky.&quot; Vai chuckled nervously, and looked up as Elspeth Post 
called her name. She frowned sadly and took a gasp of air.

&quot;Um, Avelina, I gotta go.&quot;

&quot;You auditioning?&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;ll just tell her I&#39;m quitting, and this was a mistake.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t quit.&quot; Avi smiled and took her hand, and grinned. &quot;I&#39;d like to 
work alongside you. I hope you and I can be friends since you&#39;re not 
utterly repulsed by me. Do you drive?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Uh, just when I need to. I drove here.&quot;

&quot;Could I have a ride home? My boyfriend had to go into work and I, well, 
you know. My vision. So at least stay until I&#39;m ready to go. I&#39;d be very 
grateful.&quot; Vairocana sighed and smiled very warmly, relenting easily. 
She took Avi&#39;s hand and clasped it before mounting the stage, taking her 
new friend&#39;s words to heart.

Only losers call other people a genius. &quot;She&#39;s different, she&#39;s 
special.&quot; Pick yourself up, Vai. All you can do is your best. If you put 
everything you have into something, doesn&#39;t that make you a genius as 
well?

Elspeth Post proudly added her to the play. Sarah Johansson had just the 
spot for her in the musical. Avelina clapped and gave her new friend a 
supportive hug. Vai was not used to hugs, at least not ones from outside 
her family, but she returned it warmly, treasuring it.

&quot;Thanks. You have no idea how badly I needed that hug. It&#39;s been too 
long.&quot;

&quot;Oh. I should give you more, then.&quot; Avelina hugged Vai again, and she 
laughed. They let go and shared a hearty smile each.

&quot;Are you up next?&quot;

&quot;Nah, &#39;R&#39; is far down the alphabet. You&#39;re an &#145;N&#39;, right?&quot;

&quot;No, &#39;K&#39;, as in Fort Knox.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; The girls sat back down, and with a smile, Vai just had to ask, 
&quot;So... does your boyfriend have a brother?&quot;

.........

The good news was that May Tramble had made it into the musical, and she 
had even been cast as the lead, the infamous pirate Jinx O&#39;Mallory, the 
unluckiest corsair ever (her stand-in was Vai, fittingly; Vai was to 
play a supporting role otherwise). Opposite her was Janine Bautista, who 
would play Beth &quot;Bullseye&quot; Johnson, Jinx&#39;s new 
boss-turned-rival-turned-lover (her stand-in was Avelina; she was 
playing a supporting role as well). May had dreams of acting, and 
although her singing was questionable, it was a musical with pirates, 
and she could not resist!

The bad news was that, according to the script, she and Janine/Beth 
would have plenty of love scenes. It was a romantic comedy, written by 
Gabrielle herself a few years back, and although it contained a 
heterosexual love story, the frame could be fitted anywhere and thus, 
its acceptance. May had always wanted to be on the stage (Janine was a 
veteran and got the role easily, having impressed Miss Post in the 
past), but not like this, not the costar in a romantic comedy with 
another girl. Both she and Janine had professed how very un-Sapphic they 
were, many times; it seemed fate was opposed to their opinion, though.

Of course, Avelina was glad she had not gotten the big roles. She loved 
Ethan so much, she would not have shared a single kiss with anyone else, 
neither man nor woman, even if it was an act, even if it was one time. 
Her character thankfully just caused trouble and had a big solo number. 
Vai was also spared, though her character technically had a thing for a 
fellow pirate, but their romance was subtle and subdued. She would 
barely hug the other girl&#151;it was Janine and May who needed to worry.

Their troubles started on the first day of rehearsal, the first Monday 
of October, after school. Miss Johansson was in charge of most of the 
play, while Miss Post directed part of it and had Gabrielle O&#39;Shannon 
come in to add, edit, or cut away as she saw. Most of the actresses and 
singers liked Miss Johansson (or Miss Jo, as she permitted them to call 
her) and got along with her well, so having her direct and choreograph 
was natural. Singing, dancing, and acting was no problem (after all, it 
was Gabrielle who had written it, and being dyslexic, nearly every line 
in the story was simple); it were those awkward romantic moments that 
bothered them.

For the time being, May and Janine pantomimed false kisses, leaning in 
to barely brush their cheeks together, or else using their backhands. 
They would carry on with their lines, pausing here and there to observe 
a romantic moment, and continued, or evolved into song. A few of the 
more bawdy girls hoped to see some &quot;action&quot;, and took no liberty in 
reminding the stars that sooner or later, they would have to smooch. The 
audience would not buy false romance from two scoundrels who were 
supposed to be infatuated with each other.

The worst part about it all was that Bautista and Tramble knew they were 
right.

They decided to do the professional thing and get it over with in 
privacy, so May drove to Janine&#39;s house, leaving her sister to study 
with Victoria and Olivia, who she had befriended at the pool some days 
earlier. She brought her copy of the script over (having memorized 
nearly all of it), and a fit of nervousness to boot. She knew that 
Janine had locked lips with girls before, mostly in friendly gestures 
with her close pals, but was still generally uncomfortable about it. May 
was a virgin when it came to kissing, though: she had not even kissed 
her parents, nor her sister, nor even her last boyfriend.

She saw her breath come out as she rang the doorbell. Janine answered a 
few seconds later, looking pretty in one of her many outfits. She had on 
enough accessories to pass off as a corsair queen (Post gave her 
permission to use some items from home in the play), and her 
Filipino-Chinese roots gave her the exotic finish. She swept her wavy 
black hair aside as she smiled and welcomed her friend inside.

&quot;You look great,&quot; said May.

&quot;You too. You growing your hair out?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I decided to last month. I haven&#39;t cut it since my birthday, and 
I&#39;m waiting for it to get to my waist before I start trimming it. I 
missed having long hair.&quot; She grinned, Janine shared it, and they sat on 
the floor, cross-legged. May&#39;s hair was well past her ears, slightly 
longer than Janine&#39;s, tied in a horsetail, and was such a dark brown it 
looked nearly black (June&#39;s was a shade lighter, more like milk 
chocolate). Jinx O&#39;Mallory, who had short hair in the script, would have 
to wear a bandanna.

&quot;Well,&quot; said Janine uneasily, &quot;let&#39;s get to work. No more avoiding it. 
We have to do this; the entire show depends on those silly love scenes 
Gab put in.&quot;

&quot;Should we say anything to her?&quot; (May was studying Gabrielle in Madsen&#39;s 
class that week) Janine shook her head.

&quot;No, let&#39;s not. It&#39;d break her heart, and I owe her one for keeping a 
certain secret of mine. Besides,&quot; she added testily, &quot;it&#39;s not like I&#39;ve 
never kissed a girl before, and you are a good friend of mine. You... 
apply.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; murmured May, unenthusiastic. &quot;I&#39;ve never kissed anyone for 
the record. You&#39;ll... be my first, if we go along with this. And that 
other girl, uh... Avi-something, she&#39;ll have a fit if we don&#39;t, and 
would probably quit. We need that voice, Jean.&quot;

&quot;I know! She&#39;d blow Simon Cowell away easily.&quot; May agreed with a smile.

&quot;Then let&#39;s get this over with, and stop being selfish. It&#39;s just a play 
after all.&quot;

&quot;Musical.&quot;

&quot;Right, whatever. It&#39;s not like it matters.&quot; She gave a very watery 
grin, hardly convincing. Janine cleared her throat.

&quot;So... how do you wanna do this? Just... go for it, or practice lines?&quot;

&quot;Maybe we could just do a little one first,&quot; mumbled May shyly. &quot;Like 
get a, uh, feel for it, y&#39;know? Then practice lines and see how that 
goes.&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Janine uncrossed her legs and &quot;sat&quot; on her knees, feet pointed 
backwards. She bunched up her hair so it stayed out of her face as May 
did the same. They both looked at each other and took several nervous 
breaths. The pause was numbing.

&quot;Uh... you ready?&quot; asked May, visibly shaking. Janine tried to control 
her own shivers with a frown.

&quot;I guess. You cold?&quot;

&quot;No, just nervous, y&#39;know. I mean, you know... I&#39;ve never kissed 
anyone.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not so bad,&quot; offered Janine, &quot;and I guarantee you, it won&#39;t make 
you gay. Believe me on this.&quot; May grinned but still shivered. She took 
another breath and tried to relax.

&quot;Okay,&quot; she huffed, &quot;just a little one. For practice. For the play.&quot; 
Janine nodded, blinked, leaned in, and closed her eyes as she felt May&#39;s 
lips touch hers. Peck. They parted. Whew. She smiled.

&quot;No big deal.&quot;

&quot;Meh. I had always hoped my first kiss would be... you know, romantic. 
No offense.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. My first with a girl was with Vicki, just as an 
experiment&#151;you know, something in grade school. Well, uh... you wanna 
try again? Go for the lines? Make it short, make it long?&quot; May knew she 
would regret her words, but... the thespian in her was too strong! 
Anything for the stage, or as near as her conscience allowed!

&quot;Maybe... another one.&quot; Janine nodded and repeated the kiss. She took a 
breath after it ended, a mere brief half-second later. Not bad. She 
smiled and went for a slightly longer one, finally getting a good taste 
of May&#39;s mouth. The poor young woman slipped away after feeling her 
friend&#39;s lips for just a moment too long.

&quot;Sorry. It&#39;s just weird.&quot;

&quot;I know. Should we stop?&quot;

&quot;We have to get this down. We won&#39;t convince anybody we&#39;re supposed 
to... you know... like each other.&quot;

&quot;But that means we&#39;ll have to get intense. May...&quot; Janine&#39;s beautiful 
brown eyes, so similar to May&#39;s, beamed with professional intensity and 
desire; she too had an inner thespian wanting to burst out, and in spite 
of the &quot;risk&quot;, she wanted to grant it freedom. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to 
do it. We may not like it, but the show...&quot;

&quot;Must go on,&quot; they chanted together. May sighed and said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s 
read from the script a bit and get a feeling of how we&#39;re really 
supposed to feel.&quot;

&quot;A feeling of how we&#39;re supposed to feel?&quot; May gave her friend a 
smoldering yet friendly look, nudged her in the knee, and plucked her 
copy up. She read from her highlighted lines, Janine from hers.

Jinx: Bah! No huge treasure to be found after all! What a waste! Just 
some foolish old mementoes! We can&#39;t even sell any of this!

Bullseye: I know. What kind of a pirate would put such sentimental 
things into a box and claim it&#39;s the greatest treasure of all? He 
must&#39;ve been&#151;(she pauses suddenly. The two pirates slowly realize the 
importance of the &quot;treasure&quot;)

Jinx: Beth! That&#39;s it! This was everything Mouse loved! His TRUE love, I 
mean! Gold and silver may rot, but here, it&#39;s his love that remains, 
eternally&#151;a sign for those who come seeking the greatest treasure.

Bullseye: You mean to say... that all this time... it has been LOVE?

Jinx: Yes. And... he was right. I love you, Bethany my darling&#151;more even 
than treasure, for you are a treasure in yourself. (he kisses her 
passionately)

&quot;Uh, what now?&quot; asked May. Janine frowned and shrugged.

&quot;Kiss me passionately, I guess.&quot;

&quot;Jean...&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. May, I swear, either I&#39;ll make all this up to you or 
Gabrielle will get a piece of my mind. Just... for the play, all right? 
We both got the roles, so we may as well play them out. It is just an 
act, after all.&quot;

&quot;That makes things better,&quot; murmured the older woman. She sighed in 
defeat, and resigned herself to the whims of the authoress as she took 
Janine into her arms and tried her hardest&#151;her damnedest&#151;to kiss the 
other woman with passion.

May Tramble frightened herself to death as she felt immense sparks 
flying.

She had to force herself to pull away.

&quot;I think that&#39;s good enough,&quot; she croaked shyly. Janine blushed.

&quot;Yeah... uh... let&#39;s read on.&quot;

Bullseye: Jinx... what a sweet person you are. I love you too, and 
everything about you. How could I live without that smile you give me, 
that laugh I feel, that utter joy and sheer rush...? Let the seven seas 
be wide and strong enough to hold our love; all the land itself could 
not! (she returns his passionate kiss)

&quot;God, I swear, Gab...&quot; Janine growled to herself; May braced herself for 
the kiss. They shared a sad frown and submitted themselves to the stage, 
and each other, again. Janine kissed with passion; she felt May get into 
it and, amazingly, perhaps, enjoying it. They both moaned. Flames and 
eruptions burst in her chest. She slowly slipped out of control: May&#39;s 
lips were so entrancing...

&quot;Guh! ...Sorry!&quot; Both girls sat there trying to catch their breath, 
hiding their flushed faces as best they could. May massaged her cheeks. 
Janine blew air from a mouth that had been nearly making out with her 
own friend&#39;s lips. They took a breather and asked if each other were all 
right, and if they should continue. Yes&#151;for the play.

Jinx: Then let us be wed, and live together as lovers on the sea, true 
living examples of the greatest treasure in the world:

Both: Pure love! (they kiss again.) (song: Finale, &quot;Love is a Treasure&quot;)

&quot;Here we go again,&quot; muttered May. She took Janine carefully and kissed 
her, holding her shoulders as their lips met, rubbed, parted, puckered, 
pouted, gasped, and merged. The mouth-to-mouth embrace lingered. Janine 
took May&#39;s hands and clasped their fingers together. May gave out a soft 
moan of contentment, &quot;Mmm,&quot; and continued kissing, laying her lips on 
Janine&#39;s again, again, again, again, and then they parted. Their faces 
were pink and white, embarrassed, with unexpected excitement traced upon 
them.

May took Janine&#39;s cheek in her hand, pulled the other girl close, and 
kissed her. Janine laid her hand over her friend&#39;s, opened her mouth, 
and gently enveloped the top lip. May gently pecked, planted, petted the 
lower; they parted and stared, part horrified and part aroused, into 
each other&#39;s brown eyes.

&quot;Ohmygod, I&#39;m so sorry...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

&quot;Sorry.&quot; They distanced themselves, breathed desperately, and tried to 
gain their composure. Tried, and failed.

&quot;This is nuts,&quot; whispered May, sounding afraid. Janine agreed 
wholeheartedly.

&quot;Yeah. I think we better stop for now.&quot;

&quot;Should we... try again? I mean... you know... later?&quot;

&quot;Maybe. Let&#39;s wait awhile, and... make sure our heads are on straight 
first.&quot;

&quot;Right.&quot; May packed her things up and murmured a farewell. She left 
Janine&#39;s house in a stupor, touching her lips again and again, surprised 
at herself and how she had nearly lost control. Questions, like the 
falling gold leaves, piled up everywhere as she drove off towards home.

.........

May Tramble was still in shock when she came through the door and 
dropped her things. She made her way to the den couch and slumped on it, 
willing to &quot;veg out&quot; for the rest of the day. She got as far as turning 
the TV on to a used car commercial when her sister and Victoria came 
into the room, one escorting the other.

&quot;Hey sis. How&#39;d it go?&quot; May gave her twin sister a look of complete 
incredulity. How could she possibly answer?!

&quot;Progress was... made.&quot;

&quot;Good. Remind me when the first show opens and I&#39;ll buy front row 
seats.&quot;

&quot;Will do. Uh, Vicki, will you and Olivia be joining us for dinner?&quot;

&quot;No, sorry,&quot; said the young girl, &quot;dad&#39;s got something planned and Liv 
has more homework than she does hair on her head. We&#39;ll be going as soon 
as our ride&#151;&quot;

HONK-HONK!!

&quot;...Gets here.&quot; She grinned sheepishly, then focused down on June. The 
two girls squeezed hands and, to May&#39;s surprise, exchanged a kiss, right 
on the mouth. She blinked in surprise as Victoria shied away smiling, 
and barely whispered a farewell as she opened the door. When the two 
Trambles were alone, May stared at June in a way she never thought she 
would before.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; June Tramble, chocolate hair and wheelchair, 
smiled sweetly as her cheeks grew rosy and her hands fumbled. She 
cleared her throat and looked up at her twin sister.

&quot;I&#39;m coming out of the closet, May,&quot; she announced. &quot;Vicki is my 
girlfriend.&quot;</pre>
