<a href="../original/shadowland2-ch28.html">Back to Part 28</a><pre>&quot;KIMAA!!!&quot; Kimberly called, she had no idea where she was or where her 
other half disappeared too. She did exactly as Alyson explained and yet 
she found herself lost yet again, &quot;Why does this keep happening to me?&quot; 
She muttered under her breath as she scanned her surroundings. She stood 
in the middle of a long narrow muddy path surrounded by many trees. At 
first she thought she was back in the Western woods when she noticed 
that the trees did not react in the same way as those of the woods, 
these trees were normal bark and leaf and showed no signs of movement 
other then the occasional passing breeze. A wind that carried a scent of 
spring upon its wings, a mix of wet leaves and damp earth filled Kim&#39;s 
lungs and she let out a shiver. The mere smell made her feel wet then 
she noticed that her dress was indeed damp with moisture as if she had 
been standing in the rain for hours, yet at that moment the sun cased a 
warming light from overhead that cut through the chill that threatened 
to overtake Kim&#39;s bones.

Kimberly&#39;s eyes drifted down the path to see an odd looking building in 
the distance. Discovering nothing in the opposite direction she decided 
that any house was more welcoming than standing in the middle of an 
empty trail. She took in a deep breath and let out her worries with an 
exhale, and then began her trek towards the house. Mud squeezed between 
her toes as she tread along and they started to ache with the cold that 
seeped through the chilly puddles, yet the closer Kim go to the 
building, the warmer and safer it felt to her. It almost emitted warmth 
from its walls that called out to Kim and she suddenly broke into a jog 
trying to get a closer look. As she approached the building the trees 
parted and gave view to a grand house sitting upon a large lot. A small 
granite wall about waist high surrounded the entire plot, constructed of 
many stones of varying shapes and sizes. Atop the wall was a tall black 
iron fence that hauled Kim&#39;s approach. Its iron bars stretched off high 
overhead with bright green vines covering it making Kim feel more like 
she was the prisoner looking upon such a wonderful land. 

Kim peeked through the vines to get a better look inside however found 
to her disappointment several bushes obstructed her view. She walked 
along side of the wall, trying hard to get a glimpse of the house beyond 
those bars, when she came across a break in the stones. Cut into the 
wall was a set of small steps with an iron gate at the top. She climbed 
each stair not even noticing that she became younger with each step 
until she was no more then ten years of age. She was too excited to 
notice the change in her height for from here she could now see beyond 
the massive yard within. There were many beautiful flowers all about the 
yard and several trees covered in the tangles of vines that also covered 
a portion of the house. The house itself seemed rather old and has a 
worn look to it&#39;s exterior, yet despite its age it seemed welcoming. The 
building was a large two-floor structure made of red bricks with a large 
wooden front patio surrounded by a hand carved wooden railing. Kim could 
see a swinging wood bench attached to the overhanging roof by long bits 
of chain that squeaked in protest. Two small girls in yellow summer 
dresses sat upon the bench and giggled as a third, taller, girl lightly 
pushed the swing with her foot as she sat upon the railing reading a 
book. The girl on the railing suddenly looked up over her book to see 
Kimberly watching them. She gave Kim a warm smile that only made Kim 
want even more to pass beyond the gate before her. 

&quot;Hey!!&quot; The girl waved to Kimberly and jumped from her spot on the 
railing to rush down the steps to a small path that lead to the gates, 
&quot;Come on in!&quot; She flipped a small latch and opened the gate and offered 
Kim her hand, &quot;Come join us.&quot; The two girls on the bench stopped 
swinging to see who had caught their friend&#39;s eye, they to waved at Kim 
to join them. 

Happy to be invited in on the fun Kimberly reached out to take the 
girl&#39;s hand and allowed herself to be drawn towards the patio, a smile 
upon her face.
