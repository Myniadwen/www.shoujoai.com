<h1>The Exorcist and the Demon (part 7 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/exorcistdemon-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>      &quot;Oh, Seth, you should come over. It&#39;s just a small town... yeah, mm-hmm. Just take the 
train here and walk a block... no, no, it&#39;s the bed and breakfast. Yeah, the owner said you 
could come. Okay! It&#39;ll be like a romantic vacation... love you too... bye.&quot; Krystal hung 
up, put her phone away and looked over to see Isaka pouting on the bed.

      The Lamets needed some time to accept their daughter so Mina was staying at the bed 
and breakfast tonight. Abby said that Krystal could have her boyfriend come stay for a few 
days so... that&#39;s why Isaka was pouting. &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be like that...&quot; Krystal gave her a kiss 
on the forehead. &quot;If you don&#39;t be a good girl, I&#39;m not going to let you snuggle up against 
me.&quot;

      The five year old eyed the amount of cleavage shown by Krystal bending over in front 
of her. Krystal let out a sigh as she wiped the drool of the demon&#39;s mouth. 

***** 

      Eveon sat on the edge of her bed, impatiently swinging her legs back and forth. She 
wasn&#39;t sure why she let Mina stay in her room with her. Maybe it was because that&#39;s how 
their sleepovers usually were? Or... Eveon gulped and looked over at the bathroom door. The 
water stopped running and Eveon brought her knees to her chest. Maybe it was because she 
wanted Mina to be there. This was so confusing, but...

      Her thoughts were interrupted as Mina came out of the bathroom, drying her head with a 
towel. Mina had to borrow some of Eveon&#39;s clothes and unfortunately for the blonde, Mina 
didn&#39;t borrow that much. Being the tease that she was, Mina only borrowed a pair of panties 
and a sleeveless shirt. As she reached up to dry her black hair, the shirt rode up and Eveon 
just let out a long sigh.

      &quot;You&#39;re incorrigible.&quot; Mina just giggled at Eveon&#39;s words and sat down next to her 
friend. &quot;Oh, come on... A girl can try, can&#39;t she?&quot; She gave Eveon a little shove. &quot;It&#39;s 
your turn to take a shower. I don&#39;t want to cuddle with you if you&#39;re dirty.&quot;

      The blonde girl gave a dry laugh on her way to the bathroom. &quot;Ha. Maybe I should 
consider not taking it then.&quot; Right before she closed the door, she could hear Mina&#39;s 
indignant cry, &quot;Eveon!&quot;

      Mina pulled at the shirt a bit before smiling and lying down on the bed. Sure, she was 
being quite presumptuous, but she loved Eveon so much... and she almost had her in the 
forest. This was the perfect moment to get Eveon to reciprocate her feelings! Mina turned 
over and buried her face in the bed spread. It smelt like Eveon... She giggled and curled up 
on top of the bed. Just thinking of all the things her and Eveon could do made her excited! 
They could go to the movies... go out together to eat... well, they had done that stuff as 
friends, but now! They would be kissing and hugging and...

      As Mina&#39;s love train of thoughts blasted on the tracks, Eveon had finished her shower. 
Unlike her best friend, she was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. Of course, the blonde girl was 
a little confused as to why her friend was giggling to herself on the bed. Eveon bit her lip 
and decided that she didn&#39;t really want to know. She sat down on the edge of the bed and 
started to comb her hair. &quot;You know, Mina, if I couldn&#39;t see your hands, I would think you 
were being weird...&quot;

      Her friend almost fell off the bed in shock and turned to see her. &quot;I-I, um...&quot; Mina&#39;s 
face was bright red and she wasn&#39;t sure what to say. Instead, she moved to sit down behind 
Eveon before pulling the girl so her back was up against her front. &quot;Let me comb your hair 
for you.&quot;

      Eveon just laughed and handed her the comb. &quot;Your hands better be clean.&quot; Mina gripped 
the comb angrily. &quot;Man... you are lucky I love you or you&#39;d have a big welt right now...&quot; As 
she combed Eveon&#39;s hair, Mina noticed that her face had gone bright red. &quot;What&#39;s wrong 
Eveon?&quot;

      The blonde girl shook her head. &quot;Nothing!&quot; Of course, that was a total lie. In fact, 
the problem was that Mina had said she loved her and Eveon... well, it made her feel funny 
on the inside, but the good kind of funny. And her back being pressed up against Mina&#39;s 
front wasn&#39;t helping either... Mina let the comb fall to the floor as she embraced Eveon. 
&quot;You smell nice and clean.&quot; Eveon nervously stood up and broke the embrace. &quot;M-Maybe we 
should go to bed, n-now.&quot; The blonde girl turned out the lights as Mina pulled back the 
covers.

      Eveon navigated through the darkness and sat on the edge of the bed. &quot;Ready to go to 
sleep,&quot; Mina asked as she wrapped her arms around Eveon&#39;s shoulders. She sat up and looked 
down at Eveon as she looked up. &quot;S-s-sure... you... you&#39;re making me nervous...&quot; Mina just 
fell backwards on the bed and pulled Eveon with her.

      &quot;I know. But that&#39;s okay. A lot of things in life can be nerve-racking, but 
sometimes... those things are good.&quot; Eveon said nothing. They settled into the bed, 
silently. Mina turned over to look at Eveon and the blonde haired girl could only stare 
back. They stayed like that for awhile until Eveon pulled Mina towards her in a hug.

      &quot;You must be cold dressed like that...&quot; Mina tucked her head under Eveon&#39;s and let out 
a sigh. Eveon nuzzled into her black hair and she could smell peaches. For a while, they 
were silent, until... well, Mina started nuzzle into Eveon&#39;s fragile neck and the blonde 
girl shivered out of surprise.

      The blonde girl pulled back to look down at her friend. &quot;I... Mina...&quot; Her friend just 
tilted her head. &quot;Yes...?&quot; Eveon took a deep breath, but it was caught in her lungs when 
Mina&#39;s fingers started to trace her lips. For a second, she had to think about it, but she 
stared down at Mina&#39;s blue eyes.

      Eveon closed her eyes and started to lean forward. Mina gasped out of surprise, but 
figured that this was her chance. She tenderly cupped Eveon&#39;s cheeks and leaned forward as 
well. Eveon&#39;s eyes flickered open for a second when Mina&#39;s lips brushed hers, but she just 
closed them again. Mina was ecstatic, but she kept the kiss chaste.

      It was sweet, soft and timid, exactly how Mina imagined it. She could feel Eveon&#39;s 
hands land on her shoulders. Mina was about to pull back, but Eveon timidly moved her lips 
and her tongue darted out. Thus ensued a long make out session until they pulled away. 
Eveon&#39;s face was bright red and Mina was so ecstatic that all she could do was cuddle 
against Eveon.

      &quot;Does this mean...?&quot; Mina asked quietly and Eveon took a deep breath. &quot;...I guess 
we&#39;re more than best friends...&quot; Mina gave her a peck on the cheek and smiled happily. &quot;I 
think you&#39;re mom was kind of right about you being submissive...&quot; Eveon blushed as Mina 
brushed some of her blonde hair away from her face.

      &quot;...but you did initiate the kiss...&quot; Speaking of kisses, Mina leaned in and Eveon 
relented. The kiss was sweet and slow, causing Eveon to let out a sigh of contentment when 
they pulled back. &quot;You&#39;re a good kisser Eveon.&quot; The blonde girl giggled. &quot;You too.&quot;

      Mina just cuddled up against her again. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a submissive ninny... 
and it doesn&#39;t particularly matter, does it?&quot; Eveon shook her head and wrapped her arms 
around Mina. &quot;Nah... You&#39;re just really aggressive Miss 
I&#39;m-going-to-embarrass-Eveon-by-not-wearing-anything-to-bed.&quot; Mina giggled and wrapped her 
arms around Eveon&#39;s neck.

      &quot;Oh, I am too wearing stuff. I mean, I could have stolen the whip cream from the 
fridge to embarrass you, right?&quot; They both giggled and then Eveon yawned. &quot;I&#39;m tired, 
Mina...&quot; Her friend just nodded and gave her a quick kiss on the lips. &quot;Okay, but real fast 
&acirc;&#128;&#147; will you... will you be my girlfriend?&quot; Eveon blushed and smiled. &quot;Do you really have to 
ask?&quot;

      It only took them a few minutes to fall asleep holding each other.
