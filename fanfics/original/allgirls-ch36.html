<h1>All Girls School (part 36 of 109)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/allgirls-ch35.html">Back to Part 35</a><pre>&quot;Resolutions, Part One&quot;

Furious Hail smiled with perverse glee as Miss Madsen&#39;s class started. 
Ivory Tran was not in school. Ancelin Yi was. She had surprised her 
father by coming to school early, though if he knew her ulterior motive, 
he would&#39;ve kept her home as long as possible. The day had finally 
arrived. Now all she need do was wait for the proper moment. After 
school hours, she had planned, after Ancelin&#39;s kendo club ended, it 
would take place. She would attend and endure it, and then conclude her 
relationship with Miss Yi. It would be done then, later that day&#151;she had 
waited long in order to do it without Ivory&#39;s interference. Soon, 
yes&#151;soon. It would all happen soon.

Hail could not concentrate in art class. Mrs. Keys noticed the 
difference in her student, and tried to pry time away from her teaching 
to talk. All she could get from the dark, twisted young woman was that 
she was &quot;in a good mood for a change&quot;, and &quot;couldn&#39;t wait for later&quot;. 
She gave her favorite teacher a hyena&#39;s smile, unsettling her a little. 
Keys advised Hail to not get into more trouble than she could handle, 
and was dismissed with a grateful, confident wave. Corona Marcos was not 
fooled by the outer appearance: something ill brewed beneath that 
fa&ccedil;ade, but what?

She had a bad feeling about this.

Hail endured the rest of her day as best she could, but got impatient 
before long. Several what-if scenarios came to mind, each one making her 
more nervous than the last. What if Ancelin should cancel her class and 
go home early? What if Ivory came to school in the middle of the day? 
What if somebody suspected her, like Keys or Madsen, or Leena, who got 
involved in many of her student&#39;s lives? What if, what if...

Katt doubled over and supported herself on her knees and inhaler. She 
was pushing herself so hard, both in music and in gym, and she was 
paying for it. Leena rubbed her back and asked everyone to wait. Poor 
Katt looked embarrassed and useless, but Leena encouraged her and urged 
her to stay. Hail frowned as she watched the two, and felt sick. Could 
they please, she thought, take their little date somewhere else? Katt 
finally got her second wind, put her support device away, and gave a 
pathetic smile. Deep in her cold stone heart, Alexandra Blair wanted to 
take the older girl in her arms and hold her so gently...

&quot;Okay, back to business!&quot; Leena shouted. It disturbed her thoughts and 
pushed them away. Hail got chosen to be on Ancelin&#39;s team for 
basketball. She hated the sport, and playing with Ancelin made her feel 
all the more ill and upset. For her part, Ancelin regarded Hail with the 
same casual indifference she regarded everyone else. Their &quot;friendship&quot; 
had gone south quickly once Ivory broke up with her, and hearing how the 
wild woman swooned over &quot;Annie&quot; made Hail&#39;s insides churn. The game came 
and went without flair, with her team winning by a few points. Kathlyn 
looked excited that she had actually played a sport and was still on her 
feet. A few of the girls congratulated her.

Finally, gym class ended, and those in Ancelin&#39;s kendo class remained. 
They all went outside to the large empty field, and Hail followed, 
pleased that so far, her plan had not encountered any bumps. She brought 
her backpack with her, and double-checked inside. If anybody asked about 
the glass bottle she had, she would just say it was for lunch and P.E., 
and let the truth handle itself (to be safe, she had filled it with 
water early on, and had almost emptied it by then). She set her pack 
aside and tried her very hardest to get involved in the exercises 
Ancelin taught.

More girls were there than before, but not in the record numbers that 
had once graced the fields. The class was roughly an hour long and over 
with quickly, concluding with Ancelin giving everyone a cordial smile 
farewell, and telling them to take care and be safe. Hail nearly gagged. 
Could that woman be any more unbearable? She was alone with Ancelin 
soon, and wandered over to her bag to nonchalantly pluck out the bottle. 
She made a show of finishing the few drops of water and waved to her 
&quot;friend&quot;.

&quot;Lin, how goes it?&quot; she asked dumbly. Ancelin gave her an unemotional 
stare and merely shrugged. &quot;Still hangin&#39; around that Ivory chick? You 
not take my warning?&quot;

&quot;Uh, no comment.&quot; Hail shook her head, dumped the rest of the water on 
the ground, and decided that, before Ancelin could swing her bag over 
her shoulder and walk home, she would make her move&#151;a move she had been 
planning, waiting for, and anticipating ever since Ivory broke her heart 
and left her for the stupid whore before her. It began with something a 
little silly, a tug at the girl&#39;s curiosity, of all things.

&quot;Hey, Lin, c&#39;mere, I got something to show you.&quot; Ancelin walked over and 
let her bag fall. She crossed her arms and looked around, then peeked 
inside Hail&#39;s bag. While she was distracted, Furious Hail looked around 
and checked her surroundings for any signs of company. As far as she 
could see, she and Ancelin were alone. Her plan was going better than 
she could hope, so it was time to swing it into motion. Hail resigned 
herself to whatever fate would have in store for her, and took a swing 
at Ancelin&#39;s face.

Ancelin fell to the ground, stunned. Hail fluidly flipped her empty 
bottle in the air and smashed it against a rock she had planted earlier 
that morning. It broke into shards, leaving the glass with a jagged 
butt. While Ancelin was still down and nursing her wound, Hail walked 
over to her, anger flaring through her nostrils, and slapped her so hard 
that she tumbled to the ground again. She clawed at Ancelin&#39;s prize 
chestnut hair and squeezed tightly, making the taller woman grimace in 
pain. She jerked the broken bottle directly under her neck, slapped her 
again, and spat in her face.

&quot;I&#39;ll kill you!&quot; she screamed, and Ancelin screamed too. She whimpered 
as her throat brushed up against the sharp teeth of the broken bottle, 
and struggled weakly. Hail slapped her again, spat, and nearly yanked 
all her hair out as she clawed and tugged, keeping the woman&#39;s head 
still. &quot;I&#39;ll kill you, bitch!&quot; she roared, pulling Ancelin&#39;s hair as she 
hovered the bottle closer to her neck. &quot;I&#39;ll kill you! I&#39;ll kill you, 
you fucking mother-fucker bitch! I&#39;ll kill you!! I&#39;ll kill you!&quot;

&quot;No, stop!&quot; whimpered Ancelin, struggling so weakly in Hail&#39;s grasp. She 
wept and winced, but could not protect herself as the entire furious 
weight of the insane woman was pressed down on her. &quot;Stop, please! Don&#39;t 
kill me, please! Please, don&#39;t kill me!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, fuck-head!&quot; screamed Hail, slapping her and bashing her head 
against the soft, grassy ground. Ancelin was jarred and continued 
weeping, wailing, begging to be spared. Hail punched her right in the 
face and pressed the jagged end of the bottle against her neck. &quot;I&#39;ll 
kill you,&quot; she whispered, &quot;you maniac bitch-fucker. I&#39;ll kill you and 
leave you here to rot.&quot; A simple thrust, a little twist, and the deed 
would be done&#151;everything was falling into place. Hail&#39;s hatred and fury 
were at full power, her rage extended to new bounds, her broken heart 
cried out for justice, to murder the woman responsible for Ivory leaving 
her...

&quot;Please don&#39;t,&quot; moaned Ancelin, her voice weak and desperate. &quot;Please 
don&#39;t kill me Alex, please. Please, please don&#39;t kill me. Please don&#39;t 
kill me.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot; roared Hail again. Ancelin was crying bitter tears, whining 
under the weight and hate of the enraged, despondent woman who had lost 
more than she could afford to. She was willing to kill to avenge 
herself; Ancelin begged her not to, and wept and wept as Hail hovered 
over her, the bottle&#39;s jagged edge still at her neck.

&quot;Please don&#39;t kill me,&quot; whispered Ancelin desperately, her face scarred 
by wet tears. &quot;Please, please, please...&quot; Hail growled and snarled, and 
her hand shivered as something inside her told her to finish the deed. 
But something else, something very foreign and quiet, something that had 
not surfaced in years told her not to. That something became louder, and 
louder, but remained soft, pleading, begging her as Ancelin begged her 
not to kill. Ancelin&#39;s tears cried out to her, the voice cried out to 
her, and something that had nearly died in Alexandra Blair&#39;s wretched 
heart called out, and took control of her arm, pulling it away.

It softened her heart for a single instant&#151;then braced itself for the 
inevitable scream.

Hail dropped the bottle and stared at Ancelin in shock. She had to fight 
to breathe. She had to blink just to make sure she was seeing things 
right. The veil of hatred was lifting; she saw Ancelin as a poor, 
tortured, miserable person, wanting nothing more than peace and quiet, 
caught in the wrong side of a terrible love triangle. Hail&#39;s mouth hung 
open in astonishment as she realized what she had almost done. She 
slowly edged away, Ancelin rose, and sat on the ground in a numb stupor. 
Ancelin sniffled. The silence between them would&#39;ve frosted the sun 
over.

Hail realized Ancelin was staring at her, and instantly bolted to her 
feet. She scrambled away as fast as her wobbly legs could take her, 
ignoring Ancelin&#39;s voice as it called out to her&#151;&quot;Alex, wait!&quot; She 
moaned, tripped, lurched, tumbled forward, muttering and groaning as 
loss beyond loss, emptiness beyond emptiness, grief beyond comprehension 
enveloped her, squeezing her like a boa, leaving her in more agony than 
any soul could bear. She fell to the sidewalk and crawled, stumbled, 
fell. She clawed at the ground, scraping the tips of her fingers off 
against the rough pavement. Alex carried herself home, wailing the whole 
trip, and when she got inside and shut the door behind her, she began to 
scream.

She wailed for ten straight minutes. She howled until her voice died, 
until her stomach became upset and guided her to the toilet, where she 
retched and wept bitter tears. She made a tiny yelp, the last of her 
strength, and numbly flushed the toilet so the stink would not overwhelm 
her. She began to sob, curling up into a pathetic ball as every bad 
turn, every wrong deed, every moment she had been lost in the dark 
attacked her all at once, destroying her and everything she had ever 
been, leaving her so stripped that even the bone did not survive; she 
was horrid in her complete nakedness.

Hail tried catching her breath. Her mind had stopped working long ago. 
She managed to weakly lift herself to her legs and limped to the 
kitchen. She opened the drawer and searched for knives, so she could 
stab herself and end everything right there. She cursed violently as she 
found nothing, not even forks, and slammed the drawer so hard it nearly 
broke. She then tumbled back to the bathroom, to the medicine cabinet, 
where she would overdose and die, covered in her own frothing saliva.

Her damned father had locked the cabinet, as he had always done since 
discovering his daughter ingesting pills a few years back, and he kept 
the key with him. She was too weak to break the lock, so she lumbered 
away, more hopeless than before, hugging herself as she raced for ideas. 
She could not fling herself against the pavement outside, because their 
house only had one story. She could not breathe in gas fumes from the 
oven, because it was still broken. She did not want to drown herself in 
the toilet, and the shower could not hold more than a few inches of 
water, barely enough to submerge her ankles in.

Her father carried no guns, no weapons, nothing of any value for a 
person seeking instant relief. It was as if he had anticipated her 
arrival and prepared for it, going out of his way to deny her a proper 
demise. Hail moaned timidly as she checked the whole house, again and 
again, and found nothing. She finally gave up, collapsing right there in 
the kitchen, and began to weep again. She could not even die right. A 
small, fragile sound crept from her throat as she tried to make sense of 
everything, and failed.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t somebody tell me pain could hurt so much?&quot;

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

And if we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

And I&#39;ve got a twenty-dollar bill

that says you&#39;re up late night starting

fist fights versus fences in your backyard

Wearing your black eye like a badge of honor

Soaking in sympathy

from friends who never loved you

nearly half as much as me

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable...ohoh

Well I can&#39;t regret,

can&#39;t you just forget it?

I started something I couldn&#39;t finish

If we go down,

we go down together

best friends means,

well best friends means

You never knew

well I never told you...

Everything I know about breaking hearts

I learned from you, it&#39;s true

I&#39;ve never done it with the style and grace you have

But I&#39;ve made long term plans

based on these mistakes

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Is this what you call tact?

I swear you&#39;re as subtle as a brick in the small of my back

so let&#39;s end this call,

and end this conversation

there&#39;s nothing worse...

(that&#39;s right he said, that&#39;s right he said it)

I swear, you have no idea

The jealousy that became me thinking

(that&#39;s right he said)

that you always had it way too easy

Broken down in bars and bathrooms

All I did was what I had to

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s just what anyone would do

Take the time to talk about it

Think a lot and live without it

Don&#39;t believe me when I tell you

it&#39;s something unforgivable

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friends means I pulled the trigger

Best friends means you get what you deserve

Best friend thinks I pulled the trigger!

Best friend thinks you get what you deserve!

Then it came to her&#151;starvation. She would starve herself to death.

With dry eyes, dry throat, and dried-up soul, Alexandra Blair trudged 
towards her room. There she found her bed, ratty and disheveled, and 
tucked herself into the covers. She pulled them over her like a funeral 
shroud, and since she could not suffocate herself under them, she merely 
laid there, ignoring her grumbling stomach, and waited in misery for 
slow death. Her father would be home shortly, weary from working long 
hours and probably in no mood for his daughter&#39;s grief, as usual. He 
would try to fight her, try to keep her alive, the damned fool, but 
there was no way he could force-feed her. She would fight him to the 
death.

She laid there for hours, watching the ceiling or keeping her eyes shut, 
feeling her life crawl away from the endless accusing voices inside her 
head. Her house was hardly quiet: ambulances, police cars, and fire 
trucks blared past it all the time, each one competing for noisiness. 
Normally Blair would ignore it, or screech uselessly for them to shut 
up, but now it made no difference. She kept her eye on her digital 
clock, watching the time move from 4:00 to 5:00, then 6:00 and 6:45, 
when her father arrived. He came in silence.

He passed by his daughter&#39;s room once, paused, then went back to peek 
inside. Her back was turned to him and she was curled up, so he knocked 
and called for her.

&quot;Alex? You all right?&quot; He got no answer, which was better than her usual 
curse, so he turned on the lights and walked inside. She didn&#39;t grunt at 
him to turn them off, so he knew something was wrong. He sat at the edge 
of her bed and touched her back. &quot;Honey? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; She didn&#39;t even 
swat his arm away, so he became instantly concerned.

&quot;Alex, talk to me. I&#39;ve never seen you like this. Are you okay? Is 
something wrong? Are you sick?&quot; Finally she spoke, which relieved him a 
little.

&quot;Go away.&quot;

&quot;All right, I&#39;m leaving. I&#39;ll be in my room if you need me.&quot; Fat chance, 
he knew, but he believed the time would come when his daughter would 
sneak into his room again, sit on his bed, and pour her heart out, as 
she had done many years earlier, before the divorce and before the 
change.

The time turned into 7:00, then 7:30 as her father called her for 
dinner. Hail had not moved since crawling into the bed, so her father 
went to check on her again. He urged her to come to eat, but she was 
mute. He touched her, nudged her, and even brought food to her room, but 
except for an occasional &quot;Go away&quot; or &quot;Get out&quot;, he got no response. And 
the responses he did get were too quiet, too unlike his daughter.

She was still in bed by 8:00, and also 9:00 and 10:00, which was strange 
since usually she snuck out of the house to party nearly every night. 
Mr. Blair figured, naively, that his daughter was simply tired and 
needed rest, and left her alone as he went to bed and prepared for the 
next long day. But she was still there in the morning, and did not get 
up for breakfast. He begged her to come, eat something, and try to make 
it to school. But she would not budge, and remained even as he was 
getting ready to leave.

&quot;Alex, I&#39;m not going until you get up, eat something, and go to school,&quot; 
he told her. She was silent. &quot;Alex, I know you don&#39;t like me and you 
don&#39;t like my being here, but I will call work and tell them what&#39;s 
wrong so I can stay here. I won&#39;t even leave your room. I&#39;m going to see 
that you at least eat something. If you&#39;re too sick to go to school, you 
should put something in your body. I know you threw up yesterday, so 
you&#39;d better eat or you&#39;ll&#151;&quot;

And then it hit him; he realized what his daughter was doing. No matter 
how many precautions he took, there was still one aspect of his 
daughter&#39;s life he could not safeguard, and that was her own actions, 
what she did to herself, the very basic and sufficient needs that all 
humans had to adhere to. She was starving herself to death, but what 
bothered her so much now? She had tried suicide before, he knew (thus 
the precautions), but it had never been this dramatic.

&quot;I&#39;ll what?&quot; she asked weakly. He took a deep breath, touched her back 
tenderly, and activated his cell phone. In her own presence, he called 
work and told them he needed to stay home and take care of his daughter. 
They understood and gave him the day off, and with that he hung up.

&quot;There, you see? Now you&#39;re stuck with me. As soon as I see you putting 
something in your mouth and keeping it there, I&#39;ll leave. You don&#39;t have 
to go to school, just eat. Is that fair?&quot;

Alex haunted him with her silence.

.........

Noon came, and Mr. Blair had been true to his word; he never left his 
daughter&#39;s room, except to use the bathroom and make one private call. 
He hung up in relief and got some water, then went back to Alex&#39;s room. 
She was still in bed, tossed so she could look at the ceiling, and 
refused the drink. He drank it and put the empty glass away, and picked 
up a book. He read to her until a knock came at his door. He excused 
himself and went to greet his guest, whom he had hoped would arrive. She 
looked just as concerned as he did.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you could make it, Mrs. Keys. I didn&#39;t know who else to call, 
and you&#39;re the only person my daughter talks about with any reverence.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I can do, but I&#39;ll certainly try,&quot; she assured him. 
Hail&#39;s art teacher, the only person she really genuinely liked (perhaps 
in all the world), set down her things and walked to her student&#39;s room, 
asking for privacy. She knocked and called out to her.

&quot;Haley, you here? It&#39;s Keys.&quot; Hail murmured and turned her head to greet 
her teacher.

&quot;Did you come to save me?&quot; she whispered. Keys managed a smile.

&quot;I can sure try.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t bother,&quot; sighed Hail, &quot;I don&#39;t want to be saved. I&#39;m flattered 
you came, but you&#39;re just wasting your time. Just let me die...&quot; Her 
voice was so soft and hopeless that it broke Janet&#39;s heart. She walked 
over and combed Hail&#39;s long fading purple hair, breathing gently and 
trying to heal the girl&#39;s numerous wounds.

&quot;So how&#39;d you manage to convince everyone to let you play hooky?&quot; she 
wondered after awhile.

&quot;Well, after your father called me, I told Miss Marbel what the 
situation was, then I spoke to all your other teachers. They agreed that 
I should come over and try to help, since I&#39;m about the only person you 
seem to trust.&quot;

&quot;And the class?&quot;

&quot;I managed to find a sub at the last minute,&quot; she answered with a smile. 
Hail moaned gently and rolled over to face her teacher.

&quot;Don&#39;t waste your time with me, Mrs. Keys. I just want to die. You&#39;re 
too good to be in a place like this.&quot;

&quot;Well, I want to help you, Haley. Would you mind telling me what&#39;s wrong 
so I can understand your situation? And don&#39;t think I can&#39;t, because 
remember I told you about my husband.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Hail took a breath, and with a voice weakened by hunger, she 
recalled with clear detail her relationship with Ivory, the painful 
break-up, and how she had nearly killed someone in her fury, although 
she avoided using certain names and phrases for obvious reasons. When 
she concluded with her decision to kill herself through starvation, 
Janet had to admit that she was a little surprised. Her husband&#39;s death 
had been terrible for her, so she could understand what sort of pain her 
student was going through.

&quot;Well?&quot; whispered Alex. &quot;Am I hopeless? Are you shocked? Are you gonna 
arrest me?&quot;

&quot;No, this is confidential, Haley. Your secret&#39;s safe with me. I asked 
your father to give us some time alone too, so he doesn&#39;t know either.&quot; 
Hail smiled faintly, and took a deep breath as she reached for her 
teacher&#39;s arm and caressed it. Keys smiled warmly, feeling she was 
getting somewhere at last.

&quot;How we doing?&quot; she asked after a very long, intimate pause. Hail 
grunted.

&quot;Terrible.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t give up, Haley,&quot; she pleaded firmly, taking the girl&#39;s hand. 
&quot;Whatever you do, don&#39;t give up. Don&#39;t do this to yourself. You&#39;re too 
good of an artist to die so young.&quot;

&quot;So? All the best artists died young, and they were never appreciated.&quot;

&quot;Maybe, but I know you have more to say to the world than you think. 
Haley, I know you&#39;re going through a crucible right now. I went through 
the exact same thing. I managed to live on because I had a purpose in 
life; I loved teaching too much to let go.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t have a purpose,&quot; she insisted with a murmur. &quot;My whole life 
has been a waste.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re still young,&quot; encouraged Janet with a smile. &quot;You just need to 
keep trying. I believe in you, Haley, and even though you think nobody 
loves you and accepts you for what you are, I do. It&#39;s a pleasure seeing 
you in class every day. I always look forward to it.&quot; Hail snorted, but 
managed to smile as she curled closer to her teacher.

&quot;Oh really? ...Mrs. Keys... I don&#39;t think I can go back, not after the 
terrible things I&#39;ve done. Every school I&#39;ve been to has kicked me out; 
now no doubt Marbel will do the same.&quot;

&quot;She was willing to let you in, I&#39;m sure she&#39;d be happy to keep you. 
Marbel is a lot tougher than she looks, and she may yet surprise you. 
I&#39;m sure she won&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but Ivory...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll just have to forgive her, and ask for forgiveness yourself. I do 
agree that she did something wrong, but that&#39;s no excuse to keep holding 
this grudge. Forgive her and forget about her; let her own fate take 
control. Just focus on your life.&quot;

&quot;Your words are useless,&quot; sighed Hail, but then she managed to smile and 
squeeze Keys&#39; hand, &quot;but thanks for caring. I still don&#39;t know why I 
should try, though.&quot;

&quot;If nothing else,&quot; answered her teacher, &quot;the chance to come to my class 
and make beautiful art again.&quot; Hail smiled, and nearly laughed, before 
clutching Keys&#39; hand again. Janet leaned down and kissed her forehead, 
and for an instant, Hail seemed cleansed, purified, reverted back to the 
way she had been before Hell decided to give her its worst. Her eyes 
sparkled with faint hope again, and she breathed clean air.

&quot;Mrs. Keys?&quot; she whispered. Her teacher hummed. &quot;Um... you wouldn&#39;t by 
any chance know how to cook, would you?&quot;</pre>
