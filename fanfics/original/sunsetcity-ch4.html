The Diamond Star, Brookwood District

Even though it was just a little drink between lovers, Maya had decked 
herself out in the finest yet most alluring clothing she could gather 
together from what little luggage she had brought with her after she 
left Japan. And thus she came to this. It was a smooth white dress, cut 
at the thighs downwards to provide better motility for the legs. On her 
feet were open-toes high heel shoes of the exact same colour. And around 
her neck was a little silver chain that Liza had bought for her back 
when they first met in Japan. She even wore her hair up tonight. Maya 
didn&#39;t do that much because it made her look more... &#39;uncompromising&#39; 
than she would have wanted. But she wanted to look nice for Liza in the 
best way possible. And though Maya considered herself beautiful from her 
own opinion, she hoped that her Liza thought the exact same thing. 

But to get her mind off her nervousness she ordered some drinks. A glass 
of chilled white wine for the pair of them. She sat over a small table 
towards the corner of the bar. It wasn&#39;t that busy but Maya meshed into 
the background well without being noticed. She tended to get a lot of 
attention when she dressed up, so she expected it to happen again. But 
the people of this district were far nicer than those in the upper city 
thought of them. You couldn&#39;t blame them for the misconceptions, though. 
Brookwood was more or less the South-Central of Sunset City. Even after 
all the work that had been put into the revival of this city, the 
southern part of it still needed a deeper clearing over. Brookwood was 
still plagued by a gang called the Zazubaza. Until they were taken care 
of, the regeneration of Sunset City would never truly be complete. Maya 
was sure of this much. But it made her wonder why Liza would want to 
meet up with her in such a place. She knew that she was perfectly safe 
with Liza around, but, it still bothered Maya a little bit. The Japanese 
woman took a sip of her white wine while she waited. Then a few minutes 
later, the doors of the Diamond Star bar opened up to reveal Liza 
walking through them. And Maya felt her heart melting again to look at 
her. 

The White Rose was fully adorned in casual wear. In a thin pair of 
denims and a midnight black tank top covered over by a blue denim jeans 
jacket. It was probably more casual than someone of Liza&#39;s personality 
to wear but it suited her perfectly. At least in Maya&#39;s opinion. Liza 
looked around for Maya briefly, then caught sight of the journalist 
sitting at the table over in the right corner. Liza smiled quickly then 
strode over to the table, taking a seat. 

&quot;I got you a white wine,&quot; Maya spoke, charmed, &quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind 
it.&quot;

Liza shook her head for a no. Then pulled up an eyebrow as she stared at 
Maya. Or rather, what she was wearing. Then Liza looked down at herself 
and realized the complete difference between them. &quot;I&#39;m sorry... did I 
under-dress...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Maya replied, shaking her head, &quot;I&#39;m just glad 
that you&#39;re here now. This isn&#39;t the safest area in Sunset City if you 
know what I mean.&quot;

Liza blinked. &quot;I&#39;m not following you.&quot;

&quot;I guess not,&quot; But after all, Liza did kill people for a living. What 
did she ever have to be afraid of? &quot;Three years ago this place was an 
absolute dump. It was full of gangs and violence, crime and depravity. 
Then the KAIGA Group got involved. They announced something called the 
Sunset City Rejuvenation Plan. It was a pledge by the KAIGA to break the 
corruption of the governing posts, expel all the gangs and their street 
wars, clear the streets of drifters &amp; beggars, slice the flow of illegal 
immigration, provide proper heath care and most of all to rebuild all 
that had been destroyed or tarnished by the years of neglect that the 
city had seen. And in most cases the KAIGA Group have succeeded in all 
they wanted from the Plan. But though everywhere in town has seen 
improvements, Brookwood and most of the south districts have yet to feel 
the same strength of the rejuvenation as the northern districts. But 
that&#39;s for the future, I think.&quot;

The young Liza traced her finger around the edge of her wine glass. &quot;You 
seem to know much about the KAIGA Group, Maya. Anyone would think that 
they were the subject of your newest lead.&quot;

&quot;They are,&quot; Maya confirmed, &quot;Most people I know don&#39;t trust the KAIGA 
Group. I know that those feelings stem mostly from jealousy. The KAIGA 
are one of the richest companies in the world. But I really do suspect 
that they&#39;re up to no good. Which is the reason I&#39;m here in Sunset City. 
Aside from tracking you down.&quot;

Liza smiled to herself. &quot;...Always the avid reporter, eh?&quot;

&quot;It is my job, after all,&quot; Maya responded, &quot;It&#39;s not like I hate what 
I&#39;m going, but I understand why you might not like it. I know how much 
your family relies on secrecy. But I told you my feelings for you go 
deeper than my career. I won&#39;t speak a word of anything you&#39;ve told me. 
I want you to trust me.&quot;

Then Liza took a firm look at Maya, probing her. &quot;...Alright. I did 
promise to tell you my reasons for coming to Sunset City, anyway. I&#39;m 
not under contract. Like you might have thought before. I&#39;m only here on 
personal reasons. My Uncle gave me my orders. I&#39;m doing this for him 
now. And for my Family. For its honour.&quot;

Maya blinked. &quot;Family Honour?&quot;

&quot;My Cousin,&quot; Liza said seriously, &quot;the daughter of my Uncle. She was 
taught by him and trained into becoming the best of all the Argand 
Family. But she broke our codes when she left Switzerland and began her 
career of assassination in her own name. We of the Argand Family are 
forbidden to do that. And after I left Japan... my Uncle ordered me to 
set it right. To stop her.&quot;

&quot;...And by &#39;stop&#39; her, you mean...&quot;

&quot;Kill her,&quot; Liza put forth bluntly, &quot;My only option is to kill her. I 
would brake Argand Family solidarity even further than it has been if I 
fail this. For a bloodline member of the Argand Family to kill outside 
of the name of the Argand Family is high treason. It has been this way 
since time unimaginable. To preserve the honour of my Family... I have 
to eliminate my own cousin.&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Rainthorn Building, North-Central District 

A poetic sunset was falling upon Sunset City.

One whole day had passed since Ryo received the invitation to the 
Rainthorn Building. And thus he stood before the revolving glass doors 
to meet with the one who had called him here. He went into his pocket 
and fished out his invitation. Yun-Yun had finished her shift for the 
day at the Diamond Star and was helping her grandfather train the 
students at the Dojo. And of course Kayde was getting ready for another 
night of bouncing for the Whiteout Club. They were all busy so Ryo 
couldn&#39;t ask them to join him. He doubted that the people here would 
have allowed that anyway.

The young man hauled off and strode through the glass doors into the 
Rainthorn Building. He was amazed at how professional this place looked. 
Just like most of the structures in this district. But that probably was 
a good thing. Ryo didn&#39;t come to this part of the city often in his past 
but it certainly was nothing like this. The KAIGA Group had done much 
for Sunset City. Even if Kayde had a bit of a distaste for them. Ryo 
walked up to the main desk of the bottom floor and said,

&quot;Hey there,&quot; To the receptionist, &quot;My name is Ryo Asagawa. I was invited 
to speak with a woman called Cyria about something?&quot;

The receptionist took one look at Ryo&#39;s letter and saw that he was 
speaking the truth about the invite. &quot;Thank you for coming, Mr. Asagawa. 
Miss Cyria will speak with you at her office. To reach her simply click 
for the 25th Floor on the lift behind me.&quot;

Ryo nodded to her and walked around the desk towards the lift. He 
pressed for the 25th floor of the building and waited for the lift doors 
to open. They eventually did and he walked into it. The doors closed 
behind him and the lift began the slow ascent to the 25th floor of the 
Rainthorn Building. It finally reached just where it needed to. The 
doors  opened up again and Ryo walked through them out onto the top 
floor of this building. It was a long corridor over to the office of 
this Cyria woman but Ryo crossed it and came to her door. Ryo gripped 
the handle of the door and opened it, stepping inside to see her. The 
first thing he took notice of as he walked into that office was the 
wall-sized window that showed off the streets and sights of the 
district. But even more, was the gorgeous reddish-gold glow that was 
beamed from the sunset. They were hauntingly beautiful in this city. 
Hence the name. 

By the desk in front of it, however, sat the woman who had called him 
here. Cyria. He smiled broadened as she looked at the Japanese boy. The 
Son of Tsukasa. &quot;Welcome to my office, Ryo Asagawa.&quot;

Ryo walked up to the desk. Cyria stood up and projected her hand for a 
shake. The fighting youth shook back, saying, &quot;Thanks for inviting me. 
But I&#39;ve got no idea why I was invited here.&quot;

Cyria sat back down. &quot;...I just wanted to meet with you. I heard that 
you returned to Sunset City after three years of absence. I was even 
more surprised when I heard that you were the son of Tsukasa Asagawa.&quot;

&quot;You knew my Dad?&quot; Ryo questioned. 

&quot;He was a legendary fighter,&quot; The older woman commented, &quot;Famous in this 
city for all that he accomplished. And was one of the few people to 
actually be outspoken about the suffering taking place in this city 
those years ago. He left behind a legacy. I just wanted to meet the boy 
would be filling his father&#39;s shoes...&quot;

Ryo crossed his arms and shook his head knowingly. &quot;I&#39;m not going to try 
to live up to my Dad. He was a good man and a brilliant martial artist. 
But I won&#39;t live my life in anyone&#39;s shadow. Not even my old man&#39;s 
shadow.&quot;

Cyria grinned at that. &quot;Strong words. It seems as though you share more 
characteristics with your father than you realize. But as you say, you 
are your own person. So what are your plans for now? Do you intend on 
staying in Sunset City?&quot;

Though Ryo was a little suspicious about why Cyria was asking him this, 
he couldn&#39;t help but answer the question honestly. &quot;Yeah. I was all over 
the world but I realized that I&#39;d never be as happy as I was when I was 
living here. Sunset City was a nasty place back then. But it was home. 
And it&#39;s changed so much.&quot;

&quot;You can thank my company for that,&quot; The businesswoman claimed, &quot;We put 
a lot of time and money into the regeneration of this city.&quot;

Ryo nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve heard. I just can&#39;t figure out why.&quot;

&quot;Are you suspicious of us?&quot; Cyria asked, &quot;I assure you that the KAIGA 
Group have no ill intentions for this city. We are a respectable company 
that deals in issues that are so numerous we have multiple divisions and 
departments across the world. You could entrust yourself to no better 
hand.&quot;

Ryo then stayed silent after that. He didn&#39;t know what it was about this 
woman but he wasn&#39;t getting good vibes from her. In a serious, literal 
sense. For some reason he just didn&#39;t trust her. Maybe it was that calm, 
superior attitude that was doing it. But whatever it was... Ryo figured 
that his mistrust was not misplaced. The youth shoved his right hand 
into his pocket and rubbed his nose with his thumb, thuggishly. 

&quot;Is that right?&quot; He said lazily, &quot;Well I guess I should thank you. 
You&#39;ve rejuvenated my hometown and that&#39;s more than I can ask for. So 
thanks. Thanks for doing what you did and thanks for the interest in my 
personal life. Not to be rude or anything, but if this is all you have 
to say, then I think I should be going now.&quot;

Cyria nodded with another of those devious, composed smiles. &quot;Yes. I 
have duties that I need to attend to as well. But thank you for taking 
the time out of your life to meet with me. It has been... a pleasure.&quot;

Ryo again bobbed his head to her in acknowledgment. He then turned and 
walked for the door out of Cyria&#39;s office. The youth opened the door and 
stalked out, closing it behind him. Once he was gone, Cyria&#39;s smile 
darkened while she clasped her hands together.  &quot;The Son of Asagawa... 
heh. Just like his headstrong Father...&quot;

The young man himself walked down the corridor to the lift. He come all 
this way just for that quick little chat? You&#39;d think that a financial 
powerhouse like the KAIGA Group would have better things to be doing 
with their lives. Ryo pressed one of the keys to bring the lift up here. 
The doors opened and he walked inside the lift. The doors then closed 
again and made the descent back to ground floor. But to his great 
surprise, once the lift reached the 20th floor, it stopped moving. Ryo 
blinked as the whole lift process came to a standstill. 

&quot;What the hell?&quot; He yelled out.

At first it seemed like a problem with maintenance. In which case it 
would be fixed soon enough. But the doors of the lift began to open 
again. Much to Ryo&#39;s surprise. He looked out the open lift doors and 
stared at this new level. It seemed sort of odd. It was just one huge, 
fairly dark room. There were pillars every twenty metres that were 
connecting the floor to the ceiling. But that was pretty much it. 
Whatever was going on, Ryo didn&#39;t want to stay on that elevator for too 
long. He had seen enough movies where those things plummet to the ground 
and kill everyone inside whenever there was a technical problem. Ryo 
stalked off the lift and into the new floor. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; He called out, his voice echoing, &quot;Is anyone here?&quot;

No reply. But he was not alone in that place. Ryo was alert when he 
heard the sound of something smashing. He turned around and looked back 
at the entrance to the lift. The doors were closed now. And there was a 
woman standing beside them. Her fist was lodged into the smashed-up 
button pad that controlled the lift from this floor. She had broken it. 
Obviously to keep Ryo on this level. The woman was about late 
twenties/early thirties looking. Wearing a pair of sunglasses and a 
feminine uniform beaming the commando colours of dirt green, night black 
and chocolate brown. 

Ryo narrowed his eyes. &quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;You can call me the Black Widow,&quot; She answered, &quot;And as for you? You&#39;re 
dead.&quot;

And Black Widow didn&#39;t leave time for the sentiment to linger. She acted 
straight away with the speed of lightning. The Argand-woman rushed ahead 
and shot her palm out at Ryo before he could properly take on board any 
of this. His body acted on reflex and ducked his head around the 
shooting palm strike. Widow thrust forwards her other palm whilst 
retracted the previous one. Ryo jerked his head to one side of that as 
well. The Black Widow growled fiercely and kicked from the hips into 
Ryo&#39;s stomach. It was a sudden strike that nailed him hard and fast. The 
Japanese boy gasped and stepped back to get a hold of things. Widow 
again was too zealous to let him have the time to recover and charged at 
him. The unguarded Ryo was struck across the face with a third of those 
palm attacks. And he could feel the slashing that was administered to 
him. Ryo held his cheek and clutched his fist, whispering to himself,

&quot;This woman is fast.&quot;

 Something that Ryo was set to learn more of. Black Widow came at him 
again, turning her body mid-motion. She kicked out her leg and led in 
that way. Ryo was a little bit better adjusted at that point though. The 
Asagawa-youth sidestepped the kick and the following back knuckle 
swinging punch. His lithe body ducked under it and allowed a new 
opening. Ryo speedily crouched to the ground and extended his leg in a 
spinning motion. Black Widow was knocked off her own heels and kicked 
forwards. But she was trained and ready. Her body evened out and she 
dove into the ground, pressing her palms firmly into stone. She flipped 
backwards from that position, rotated her body around and around until 
she landed again. On those two poised and powerful feet. Ryo went on the 
attack this time around. Black Widow swung around and blocked against 
his quick punch. Then ducked around when he attempted a roundhouse. 
Widow grinned and then thrust her palm into Ryo&#39;s ribs with that new 
opening presented. Ryo jerked a little from the force of the attack, 
providing Widow with even more openings. She hopped up on one leg and 
brought the other one around her hips. Ryo was struck across the face, 
brutally, blood knocked from the corners of his lips. He skidded back 
again from the woman. Then wiped the blood from his lips, staring into 
the Black Widow&#39;s cold, icy eyes. 

&quot;...What&#39;s this all about!?&quot; Ryo demanded, &quot;What the hell is your 
problem?&quot;

Black Widow slowly reassumed her fighting stance. &quot;Basically I&#39;m going 
to KILL you. How&#39;s that grab ya? Now get ready! Argand Family Special 
Technique No. 4! Rolling Leg Takedown!&quot;

Ryo was confused as to what that little comment meant. But he would know 
soon enough about it. Black Widow leaned back quickly then rushed 
forwards in a blur of movement. She flashed ahead until she was sliding 
along the ground with her legs aimed at Ryo&#39;s own. The Japanese man 
blinked hard when he felt the Argand-woman&#39;s legs lock against his feet 
and tug on them to one side, while Widow&#39;s upper body rolled in the 
opposite direction. The clash of direction completely threw Ryo off both 
his feet and his guard and he tumbled roughly into the ground. He 
groaned as he felt his face smack the cold stone of this dark room, 
while his legs remained locked between those of Widow&#39;s. She quickly 
released his ankles however and kicked up into a standing position. Ryo 
attempted to do the same, but the second he began ambling upwards, Black 
Widow rushed in and kicked him violently against the face. Ryo was 
thrown back again with sudden force. And he seriously began to realize 
that this Black Widow was serious. She truly intended to set about 
killing him. Ryo regained some of his senses and rolled away from the 
Black Widow. He soon flipped back up into a standing position and 
clutched his fists together. Time to turn this little fight around a 
bit. His voice spoke up again, saying, 

&quot;You&#39;re pretty good,&quot; Ryo complimented, resuming a smile, &quot;And I can see 
that you really want to kill me here. I have no idea why... and I won&#39;t 
ask you. Because I can tell that you&#39;re just a lackey for a higher 
power. And so you won&#39;t tell me shit-all, will you? But that&#39;s fine. I 
really don&#39;t like using my REAL power against women... but it looks like 
I have no choice in the matter.&quot;

Widow scowled at him. &quot;False boasting like that will get you nowhere 
with me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s a boast alright,&quot; That smouldering azure Chi of Ryo&#39;s began to 
materialize around his trained body, &quot;...But it&#39;s not false...&quot;

There was a flash of momentum soon after that. One second Ryo was 
standing about ten metres from Black Widow. The next he was staring down 
straight into her face. The blonde woman blinked with surprise at that 
burst of speed. But Ryo ignored that entirely and drew back his right 
hand. He squarely punched the assassin dead centre in the stomach. 
Widow&#39;s breath was struck right out of her. Like she had been kicked by 
a mule. But Ryo did not allow any gaps in strength or technique this 
time around. The young man decked Widow across the face twice, once on 
either cheek. The finisher was the knee of Ryo&#39;s that was rammed 
straight into Widow&#39;s already hit stomach. She coughed with the strength 
of the attack. And Ryo stepped back from the woman as she began lowering 
herself to the ground. Black Widow kept coughing and she slammed one eye 
closed, then looked up to the standing Ryo.

&quot;Why... you...&quot; She seethed. 

Ryo&#39;s smile returned to him in full force. But Black Widow&#39;s card wasn&#39;t 
up yet. She rolled forwards and forged her palms into the ground while 
doing so. Before Widow got up she kicked out her legs and latched them 
around the curves of the Japanese lad&#39;s neck. The taller guy blinked as 
Widow&#39;s legs locked around his neck and began getting tighter and 
tighter. A surprising action. Black Widow forced more pressure into the 
choking grip and sneered at the boy, saying,

&quot;Argand Family Special Technique No. 1! Handstand Double Leg Choke!&quot;

It was then that Ryo began to lose air. His face paled a little. The leg 
strength of Black Widow was incredible. But that wasn&#39;t the main issue. 
She had perfectly executed this technique which allowed her to cut off 
the air fully from the windpipe downwards. This would make him pass out 
if he didn&#39;t do something soon. Ryo grabbed the ankles of the older 
woman and gripped them desperately to get free. He struggled to turn his 
head out of the lock but it couldn&#39;t move. He was trapped in place. That 
leg grip was unbreakable. But that only made him realize the other way 
out. It wasn&#39;t very artistic but the Asagawa-boy pulled back one of his 
legs and roughly kicked at the back of Widow&#39;s cranium. The older 
woman&#39;s head jerked back and forth as she was kicked repeatedly in the 
back of the head. When blood started to appear in her blonde tresses, 
the hold around Ryo&#39;s legs slipped in strength. Just what the doctor 
ordered. With that brief gap in the armour, Ryo pulled open Black 
Widow&#39;s legs and freed his neck from the attack. He leapt backwards from 
her and took a deep breath whilst spinning in midair. Ryo&#39;s feet pressed 
into one of the tall stone pillars that were lined across the room and 
kicked off it like a springboard. Ryo hurled himself at the rising Black 
Widow like a battering ram and extended one of his lengthy legs at her. 
That cerulean Chi of his burst to life around his foot, ankle and lower 
leg in the form of coursing bluish flames. Widow was too in awe of the 
speed to block, counter or dodge it. Ryo growled into the echoing room 
and screamed,

&quot;Lance Raid!&quot;

There was the furious sound of flesh begin smacked by strength. Widow 
was struck in the stomach again. And arguably the most unguarded point 
of Black Widow&#39;s body. Both the power of the kick and the flames of 
Ryo&#39;s Chi surrounding it administered tremendous damage to the assassin. 
She stumbled back as Ryo kicked out of her stomach and backflipped into 
a standing position. But that was not the last of it. The second that he 
was standing, he was charging again. Ryo thrust himself towards the 
Argand-woman and punched her as hard as he could across the face. Black 
Widow both gasped and coughed from the blow. Then reacted in the exact 
same way when she was hit two more times in her now weakened stomach. 
She was out of it. She coughed up a glob of blood and saliva which 
splattered against the cold stone of the floor. Then she collapsed to 
the ground. Completely unconscious.

Ryo sucked in air and tried to gather his strength together. Now he 
began to understand why Cyria had called him here. To rub him out. He 
didn&#39;t know what this was about or why she would even want him dead, but 
the time had come to do something about it and find out. However he 
couldn&#39;t do that now. Black Widow was tougher than the average fighter. 
She had drained him thoroughly even if she hadn&#39;t delivered much 
physical damage. He had to get back to the Mao-Kung Dojo and rest up, 
then plan out how he was going to handle Cyria. The teen looked around 
for an alternative exit to the lift. He saw a set of stairs to the left 
of that large, dank room. Perfect. Ryo dashed for them and left Black 
Widow to sleep out her failure.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Mao-Kung Dojo, Brookwood District

Ryo sauntered down the long streets of the Brookwood District. By now it 
was night. By the time that Ryo had gotten out of the Rainthorn Building 
the sun had fallen. He made a quick escape and came straight back to the 
Mao-Kung Dojo. He&#39;d have to tell Kayde and Yun-Yun everything about what 
had happened. But that became less of an issue as soon as he reached the 
Dojo itself. He didn&#39;t even have to see the damage to realize that 
something was wrong. Ryo ran across the cobblestone path way to the Dojo 
doors and slid them open. He rushed inside to see the place in a wreck. 
All the scrolls, kendo sticks, chairs and tatami mats were in disarray. 
The windows were all smashed up and the doors into other rooms were 
broken. A fight had taken place. But nothing had shocked him more than 
to see Yun-Yun lying tiredly on the ground, blood dripping from her 
mouth and one hell of shiner across her right eye. 

&quot;Yun-Yun!&quot; Ryo ran straight over to her and crouched down, inspecting 
her wounds and bruises, &quot;Are you okay?! Say something!&quot;

Yun-Yun weakly looked up into Ryo&#39;s eyes. &quot;...I-It was... Rockeye... 
he... came in here and... wrecked the Dojo... while you and my 
grandfather... were gone... I couldn&#39;t... defeat him...&quot;

Ryo&#39;s scowl grew. Cyria had screwed him over again. &quot;Dammit it all!&quot;
