This is what it is like to be Malchior, Scion of Darkness.

Imagine, if you will, being different from everybody else.  Not merely 
different in the way all humans are, but so radically different and new 
that you are cast out of your own home, scorned and hated, and believed 
to be the product of dark magic.  Now imagine that the only thing 
keeping you sane, or alive, is your mother, the woman that gave birth to 
you.  Your father detests you, and would gladly see you drown, or 
impaled, or locked up in the dark.  Now imagine that, as bleak as this 
life is, it now gets bleaker, for your mother, the only person to have 
ever shown you any love, has now died from illness.  You are just ten 
years old, yet you&#39;re already cast outside, into the chilly darkness.

Now imagine that after about a week of wandering&#151;starving, freezing, and 
morbidly depressed&#151;you fall into the grave of a wicked king.  Some would 
call this the last straw, but not you&#151;you find yourself in a safe place, 
where the sun cannot touch you and people cannot see you.  In this tomb 
you find the Book of Shadows, scribed by the damned and dictated by the 
bi-product of evil itself.  Though illiterate, you teach yourself to 
read using this book, and are soon not only wise in the ways of the 
world, but dark magic as well.  It soon makes you stronger, and fuels 
your vengeance even more.

Now imagine one day, you gain the power to release yourself from this 
grave.  The world has aged five years, and perhaps has forgotten you.  
Soon, though, it would never forget your name:  people would whisper it 
in fear.  You have command of the dead now, after all, and since you are 
now their king, you order them to march into your old village and wipe 
out the entire population, starting with your father and ending with 
every last child, dog, and cat.  It becomes a literal ghost town, the 
cornerstone of your Kingdom of the Dead.  But you are still lonely.

Through the dark arts, you attain immortality, but you do not have 
eternal youth.  Instead you must feast off the lives of others, taking 
their energy into your own body to sustain your youth for a few years 
more.  They are then reduced to your servants, the walking dead, and you 
their king&#151;their lonely, wasted king, still hated and scorned.  But 
imagine, half a millennium later, you find the love of your life, the 
perfect mate for your soul, a woman with a scarred face and a pure 
heart, who loves you with such power that it even brings your own spirit 
to cleansing.

Now imagine, deep in the flowering of your relationship, she is stolen 
from you, tortured, and burned at the stake.

This is what it is like to be Malchior, Scion of Darkness.

......

&quot;Tell me who it was.  Who killed your lover, Garnet?  I have heard 
enough about him; I&#39;m more interested in his slayer.&quot;  Garnet bristled 
as Malchior touched his neck.  Their sexual escapade had not been borne 
out of love, but rather an alliance, an understanding between two men.  
Garnet would do something for Malchior&#151;perform services in and out of 
the bedroom&#151;and in turn Malchior would allow Garnet to have his revenge.  
The woman he sought, the one that had killed his precious Yan, would 
first be tortured, then mutilated, then sewn back together again and 
sucked of her life.  She would then serve Garnet forever, as a zombie, 
dying and dying every day but never staying dead.  It was a fitting 
punishment.

&quot;All right, all right, just shut up for a second.  I never met the 
bitch, I just heard her name from Thirteen.  He says she&#39;s called Beekay 
Power, or Kristen Masterson, or something.  Look, it doesn&#39;t matter&#151;she 
killed my boyfriend.  She ripped his godforsaken head off with her bare 
hands!  Does it matter who did it?&quot;

&quot;I guess not.  Thank you for answering my question, Garnet.  You may 
continue.&quot;

&quot;I guess...&quot;  He sighed and knelt, kissing and kneading without any 
affection at all.  With Yan he had been playful, tender, sweet and 
sensual; with Malchior, a man nearly ten times his age, he could equate 
sex with business.  That wasn&#39;t to say that he didn&#39;t enjoy it:  despite 
being over a thousand years old, Malchior looked, acted, and loved like 
a man in his late twenties.  That he promised Garnet revenge was enough 
to make the younger man happy, and so he vowed to do anything he was 
asked, if but for a flash of retribution.  After all, Masterson had 
killed his lover.  Something like that could not be forgiven.

......

This is what it is like to be Garnet, the man with no other name.

You do not come from anywhere, and you are not anybody.  You will do 
anything that makes you feel complete, or makes you feel as if your 
running your own life&#151;including sexual relations with a man far more 
evil than you are.  You are alone&#151;your last lover was brutally 
decapitated, leaving you with nothing but hatred.  A man with no 
identity who now has hatred has now perhaps gained his identity; you are 
now Revenge, you are now Retribution, you are now Anger.  You want her 
blood, you want to tear off her limbs, you want her to soak in acid, for 
she has taken away the only thing you had.

When you discover the identity of the man you slept with, it first 
disgusts you.  After all, he&#39;s over a thousand years old, and he 
performs acts that even you would consider disgusting.  He eats 
spiders&#151;but now he eats you, devours you, relishes and enjoys you, 
because he&#39;s taken many lovers before, and you&#39;re just the newest.  
After you come to terms with who this man is and what he does, you 
suggest something to him.  Find my lover&#39;s killer, you say, and let me 
have justice for his death&#151;I will do whatever you ask until then.  He 
agrees.  You find yourself in his grasp again, but your disgust is 
overpowered by the desire to hunt this woman down and destroy her.

Perhaps once that is done, maybe you can pick up your life, reconcile 
with yourself, and go on, hopefully finding some solace.  But vengeance 
is now your new identity; what will you become once you&#39;ve reached your 
goal?  Who will you end up being?  You will be yourself, but something 
tells you that&#39;s not enough.  You need something else.  Of course, the 
mere fact that you &quot;need&quot; proves that you are, after all, still human.

......

&quot;Can I come in now?  Are you gentlemen presentable?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;  In strolled the third member of the unholy trinity, a woman of 
seductive stare and lustful body, petite and simply-dressed.  She 
noticed the stage of undress the two men were in&#151;their shirts were off, 
piquing her interest and gaining the affection of a raised eyebrow&#151;and 
cooed sadly, hugging the elder from behind.

&quot;Oh, did I come at a bad time?  Drat.  I was hoping the three of us 
could become better acquainted.&quot;

&quot;What a sick thought,&quot; muttered Garnet, shucking a shirt on.  The woman 
smiled.

&quot;You forget who has the power here.  You, dear Garnet, are little more 
than a boy, a foot soldier, with some scrap of strength and an 
irritation that won&#39;t go away.  Malchior and I are different, bulging 
with power and wisdom, the likes of which you can&#39;t hope to understand.  
We are both well-versed in the art of the dead&#151;I the communicator, he 
the summoner&#151;and at any moment, should we feel you are useless, 
why...you&#39;ll be cast away and fed to locusts.&quot;

&quot;I wish you&#39;d be silent,&quot; sighed Malchior, no more pleased at Kissa&#39;s 
appearance than Garnet was.  &quot;Give the young man some pity.  He may not 
have our degree of power, but he has raw vengeance, borne from the hole 
in his heart created by the death of his only love.  I understand that 
feeling all too well.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you&#39;re helping him?&quot; asked Kissa.  Malchior smiled foxily.

&quot;Well...he is excellent in bed, I can say that.&quot;

&quot;Nuisance!&quot; she snorted, crunching her nose up.  &quot;All this talk about 
two men in bed as lovers...it gives me such a jealous streak.  If I 
didn&#39;t know any better, I&#39;d say you quit your tryst right before I came 
in!&quot;  Malchior smiled again, wrapping his fingers around her arm and 
staring seductively.

&quot;That&#39;s nonsense, Kissa; you know that.  Our business was concluded.  
Now let&#39;s move on to another topic.  You say you found a warrior of 
excellent standard, yes?  Only one?&quot;

&quot;This one may do,&quot; she said.  &quot;In life, she was a plague, and 
slaughtered many.  Sound familiar?&quot;  The look on Malchior&#39;s face was 
enough; she scoffed and resumed.  &quot;In death, her soul is twisted.  
Suppose you summoned her and gave her a seat of command next to Garnet.  
Together they&#39;d wreak all kinds of havoc.&quot;

&quot;Havoc is not necessarily my goal, but who did you have in mind?&quot;

&quot;Just some child,&quot; Kissa mumbled nonchalantly.  Her eyes twinkled when 
they saw the curiosity of her partner, and with a stuffy laugh, she 
added, &quot;I haven&#39;t found out her name yet, but she calls herself the 
Reaper.  Interesting title.&quot;

......

This is what it is like to be Kissa Hathor-Sakmet, ancient goddess of 
destruction.

Originally, you were a court magician for a powerful Pharaoh, eons 
before the modern age.  You and your twin brother, Ata, entertained and 
educated the Pharaoh for many years, using your innate ability to 
communicate with the dead to astound him&#151;and to gain stronger footholds 
of power, for your ambitions were much higher than merely playing 
performers in the temple.  When you got wind of a plan to usurp the 
throne, you jumped at the chance, and followed your brother into the 
tomb of the god of Death, where you would steal a vial containing the 
very Blood of Osiris.  This would give you immortality and great powers, 
but at a cost so horrible that having it mentioned would curl steel 
bars.

You succeeded in fashioning bracelets that allowed you to eternally feed 
off of the blood, but a traitor was discovered in your numbers that blew 
your plans to dust.  As punishment, the Pharaoh had you and your brother 
buried alive, sealed in an unfinished tomb for an unpopular prince, 
bound and gagged in darkness.  For three-thousand years you laid there, 
dead and yet not dead, your only means of communication being the very 
land of the dead, where thousands of souls wander in bliss or in agony.  
As the years passed and your mind was poisoned by the prejudices and 
jealousies of the dead, your plots moved from punishing the Pharaoh to 
punishing the country to punishing the world.  If ever you were 
released, the wave of terror you&#39;d inflict would be unmatched by anyone, 
past or present.  There would be no future.

Years later, you were freed by a hapless archaeologist.  He was the 
first victim in your act; there would be countless others, more souls to 
accompany those that had died.  You do not know what had happened to 
your brother, but you never recovered him, and this eats away at your 
desiccated soul.  Over the ages you&#39;ve been alive, you have bedded 
countless lovers and taken countless lives, but this venture with 
Malchior very well may be your greatest.  A flicker of understanding is 
in his eyes&#151;he too knows the full power of the dark side&#151;so a union was 
inevitable.  That he has taken a boyish vassal means little; it is his 
powers you love, and so you will cooperate him, until he surrenders you 
the world and leaves for his own new home, his restored lover in tow.

......

Malchior could, by himself, summon the dead and use them for his army, 
or else vacuum souls from the living and increase his followers, but 
what he truly needed for his plan were legendary characters, the stuff 
that stories were made of&#151;the valiant dead who could not only fight for 
him, but could emerge victorious and carry him closer to his goal.  This 
is how Kissa provided for him, by seeking out the mightiest of dead 
warriors and bringing them to his attention, so he could call on them 
and bind them to his will.  Ultimately his goal was to acquire enough 
souls to fill his creations, the goddesses of death Kali and Celine, 
until they were both complete and could merge into one&#151;his precious 
Venus, lost love soon to be found again.

And in return, he vowed to leave the world in Kissa&#39;s hands, to do as 
she pleased.  Of course he would help with her own scheme of vengeance, 
but generally would leave everything to her, including the bulk of his 
powers he reasoned he wouldn&#39;t need in his new home.  She agreed to 
this, and the two forged their bond first through blood, then through 
sex.  Malchior actually liked slitting his palm more than the romp in 
bed.

In truth, the &quot;unholy trinity&quot; did not include Garnet; he was simply 
there because of his need for revenge, nothing more.  His powers were 
nowhere near as morbid or strong as Kissa&#39;s or Malchiors, and in fact he 
feared them both.  The true third member of the group was a man far more 
powerful and frightening than even those two, one who made very little 
contact with the outside world, choosing to let his operatives do that 
work for him.  Kissa and Malchior had met him a few times, and had to 
admit that being in his presence frightened them.  But a willing ally 
was nothing to fear, and the Cult of the Seven Deadly Sins, led by the 
man in black called Omega, was more than willing to help the two in 
their endeavors.

This, therefore, is what it is like to be elite members of the Cult.

You are Holivx Dirge, the man of Wrath, and first of the Seven.  All 
your life you have upheld justice, fought for the good, beating back 
evil.  All your life you have hated evil, in fact, and held 
righteousness so high in your mind that soon it became your obsession.  
You became an executioner, choosing to snuff out the criminal mind 
rather than let the corrupted courtrooms handle them, and for your 
wrath, you were excommunicated.  But one man believed in you and your 
lust, and gave you the power to achieve far greater things, but in 
exchange, possibly, for your soul.

You are Christine Velshoni, the woman of Envy, and second of the Seven.  
All your life, you have hated everything that was better than you.  You 
were always poor, always ugly, always unpopular, always cast out by 
those that had more, more, more than you ever could.  The people you 
hated most were the privileged kids, and celebrities, always so perfect 
and polished.  In your deranged state, your obsession took over several 
times; first you attacked the head cheerleader at your school, torturing 
her and turning her into a wretch; then you attacked a visiting movie 
star, smashing her teeth with a metal pipe.  Your master knew you were a 
perfect candidate for Envy, but even though you now have everything you 
could ever want, it shall never be enough.

You are Edward Nashiyori, the man of Avarice, and third of the Seven.  
All your life, you have valued possessions, ranging from beautiful crisp 
bills of cash to the bodies of human slaves, and have spent your every 
waking moment amassing more, more, more, so you could fulfill your 
greedy desires.  You are like a vacuum, sucking in the wealth of 
everything you come into contact with, and are so obsessed with your 
gaining that even your clothes are sewn with jewels and gold.  Your 
quest for power has damned your soul; you happily made an ally with that 
devil, Omega, just so you could have even more.  Perhaps you will one 
day explode from being so bloated.

You are Frederick Revini, the man of Gluttony, and fourth of the Seven.  
All your life, you have starved and hungered, and though you soon 
commanded multiple chains of restaurants, expanding your palette to 
include every conceivable edible item, you can never be satisfied.  You 
have robbed good hard-working people of their produce, and sent small 
countries into waste and ruin through methods of poverty and starvation, 
just so you could have the finest banquets on your table.  You have even 
turned to cannibalism, finding the meat of other humans strangely sweet.  
You are the infernal devourer, a pleasing favorite of your master, and 
you shall never stop eating, even if it means your death.

You are Hanz Ulric Himmler, the man of Pride, and fifth of the Seven, 
though you feel you should be first.  All your life, you have only loved 
one thing:  yourself.  You have valued your own looks, your own talents, 
your own knowledge and upbringing above everyone else&#39;s, and to lower 
your head, save to look down upon others, is unthinkable.  So confident 
are you in your skills that you have never lost, because you believe you 
never will, and your master, loving your narcissism, encourages this and 
empowers you.  Only he is superior&#151;but even that is soon to change.  You 
hate him because he is higher, but you can bide your time and wait.  
Just because you are full of yourself, that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re 
impatient.  Woe to those who tarnish your perfection.

You are Walter Barsnef, the man of Sloth, and sixth of the Seven.  All 
your life, you have never liked to work.  Despite your genius you have 
always sought jobs that require the least amount of work:  preferring to 
sit rather than stand, or lie down rather than sit.  You have gone from 
job to job, annoying people and at the same time intriguing them with 
your inactivity.  Prison to you was paradise&#151;where you were not required 
to do anything, save lay there and be good.  Life with your master, 
however, is even better, because now you do not have to do anything 
except stay, stay right there, and let your venom permeate everything.  
Death to you would be most pleasant; you don&#39;t even have to breathe.  
You can just sleep, forever, and be happy.

You are Rosalyn Eden, the woman of Lust, and the last of the Seventh to 
join their ranks.  All your life, you have been beautiful, far too 
beautiful for the best poets to describe, far too wonderful to even gaze 
upon.  The sun itself cannot bear to shine on your flawless young body; 
everything was meant to worship you and whatever you touched.  You have 
enticed and seduced thousands of men and women, never finding 
satisfaction, never achieving perfection, because they can never be as 
beautiful as you.  Only your master seems immune to your charms, but he 
loves you deeper, as a true lover would, and allows you total freedom, 
just as he allows freedom to all his servants.  Perhaps one day you&#39;ll 
meet your match&#151;but there&#39;s no point in rushing things, eh!

You are Omega&#151;and that is all that you wish to say.  You lead the Cult 
of the Seven, you are their master, and you have decided to join forces 
with Kissa and Malchior because you like the way they think.  Chaos 
suits you just fine.  With your cult, and their legions of living dead, 
you can bring about a far greater darkness than any force in the past 
has ever known.  There are only four in the world that concern you:  
first there is the man in white you are to inevitably battle, and Pale, 
the fallen angel; third is Kali, goddess of death, an alien force you 
understand very well; and the fourth is that scheming woman, Dr. Yohko 
Kamaguchi.  But that is merely the order in which they most concern you, 
and even &quot;he&quot; cannot withstand such a deluge of darkness.

Nobody can.
