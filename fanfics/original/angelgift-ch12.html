<a href="../original/angelgift-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>        Allison paced the apartment nervously muttering, &quot;Where are 
they?&quot; The boyish, sandy haired blonde looked visibly worried over how 
long it hand been since Amara, Milly and Sharin had all disappeared on 
them.

        &quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re all going to be fine,&quot; Jenna reassured her 
gently. She pushed her long black hair back and smiled at her love 
slightly, &quot;Milly and Sharin are both quite tough, and I&#39;m sure that 
Amara can take care of herself.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Allison admitted, &quot;but I just keep thinking of the 
girl I protected from the bullies.&quot;

        &quot;Amara&#39;s not that little girl anymore,&quot; Jenna reminded her. 
She smirked, &quot;Though I think Milly and Sharin would be touched by your 
concern.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Allison blushed slightly. &quot;They&#39;re both pretty 
likeable,&quot; she admitted, &quot;though I&#39;m certain that one or both of them 
is crazy.&quot;

        &quot;Talking behind our backs yet again,&quot; Sharin grumbled under 
her breath as the gorgeous blonde and Milly led Amara inside, helping 
suport the bounty hunter.

        &quot;It&#39;s positively disgraceful,&quot; Milly agreed.

        &quot;This from the cat-woman who jumps on people, with her claws 
fully extended, for the fun of it,&quot; Sharin scowled.

        Milly blew her a raspberry.

        The two eased Amara down to the couch, and the black haired 
young woman groaned out, &quot;They&#39;ve been doing this for the entire trip 
back. I wanted to shoot them both just to put them out of my misery. 
Are they allways like this?&quot;

        &quot;Pretty much,&quot; Jenna agreed.

        Allison looked over at Amara worriedly, seeing how stiffly the 
woman was moving. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;Told you she&#39;d notice,&quot; Sharin said to Amara softly.

        &quot;Saying I told you so is so rude,&quot; Amara said to Sharin dryly. 
She pulled off her overcoat akwardly, revealing her wounded shoulder, 
&quot;X&#39;orn winged me.&quot;

        The Galactic Patrol android Roma walked over and held a 
silvery hand just over the wound, scanning it. &quot;It&#39;s slightly more 
damaged than that,&quot; she said to Amara coolly, &quot;but not too serious. 
You should heal up just fine.&quot;

        Amara gave her a wry smile, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re all right,&quot; a clearly relived Allison 
said with a grin.

        &quot;Thank you for your help,&quot; Jenna beamed as she took Allison&#39;s 
arm.

        &quot;I didn&#39;t do it just for you, Princess,&quot; Amara said to her 
rather pointedly, &quot;but I guess you&#39;re welcome, anyway.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not sure I like how Amara looks at Allison,&quot; a frowning 
Milly murmured to Sharin, the red fur on her cat&#39;s ears standing right 
up, her tail puffed out.

        &quot;Calm down,&quot; Sharin reassured her. She gave the shorter 
catgirl a smile, &quot;Anything that was between them is long in the past, 
I think.&quot;

        Milly shrugged, but didn&#39;t answer otherwise.

        &quot;Besides,&quot; Sharin smirked, &quot;if you&#39;re going to worry about how 
people look at Allison, you&#39;s better watch out for Marilyn and Kat, to 
start with.&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Milly blinked.

        &quot;Marilyn may have thought Allison was a beautiful boy to start 
with,&quot; Sharin pointed towards the cheerful Galactic Patrol officer 
with a smile, &quot;but she doesn&#39;t seem to mind at all her being a girl 
now that she&#39;s gotten used to the idea.&quot;

        Milly scowled, realizing that Sharin was probably right. The 
blue haired Marilyn really was looking just a bit too admiringly at 
Allison for her comfort. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said as she moved over to 
distrract Marilyn, by fore if needed.

        &quot;No problem,&quot; Sharin smirked.

        Amara watched the group interact with a slight smile on her 
face. &#39;Interesting bunch of people Allison&#39;s fell in with,&#39; she 
thought. She pushed herself forward, &quot;I&#39;d better be going.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, no,&quot; Allison spoke up, &quot;you are not taking off with that 
wounded shoulder. Why don&#39;t you stay here, at least for tonight?&quot;

        Milly got a remarkably dangerous expression on her face.

        &quot;Why don&#39;t you take the couch for tonight?&quot; Jenna smiled. &quot;Let 
yourself heal for a bit, before anything else happens,&quot; she said 
gently.

        &quot;We would be happy to have you,&quot; Marilyn beamed.

        &quot;This isn&#39;t our house,&quot; Roma reminded her quietly.

        Marilyn&#39;s eyes filled with tears, &quot;You don&#39;t have to be so 
mean!&quot;

        Amara sweatdropped. Hoping to forestall the on rush of tears 
she quickly said to them, &quot;I&#39;d be happy to stay.&quot; Silently she added, 
&#39;For tonight, anyway.&#39;

        Marilyn got all happy again, &quot;Yeah!&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll set an extra place at dinner,&quot; Milly said, giving Amara 
a warning glance saying that to refuse would be hazardous to her 
health.

        &quot;Right, dinner,&quot; Amara agreed weakly.

        &quot;It&#39;ll give us a chance to catch up,&quot; Allison smiled, &quot;I&#39;d 
still like to know how my school friend ended up becoming a space 
bounty hunter.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;ll probably take five minutes or less to tell that story,&quot; 
Amara casually waved, &quot;but I&#39;ll try to make it entertaining.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll see you all later on,&quot; Sharin waved, following a bit 
behind where Jenna and Milly were going into the kitchen together. She 
paused in the hallway, listening to them talk.

        &quot;I&#39;m a bit nervous about Amara being here overnight,&quot; Milly 
fretted.

        &quot;I&#39;m sure that Amara will be a perfect gentleman,&quot; Jenna said 
mildly. &quot;If she leaves the living room for anything other than a 
bathroom trip,&quot; Jenna had a dangerous look on her face as she quietly 
ordered Milly, &quot;pounce, understood?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am!&quot; Milly saluted.

        Sharin smiled to herself as she slipped away, &#39;Gee, maybe 
Princess Jenna isn&#39;t quite as innocent as I thought she was.&#39;
