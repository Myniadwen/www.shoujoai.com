<h1>A Shadowlander's Dream: Book 3 - Rules of the Flesh (part 3 of 26)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kwilliams.html">Kathryn K Williams</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/shadowland3-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Several floors above the cafeteria, on the third floor, the two Dorm 
Heads, Jessica Wright and disowned Sister of Death Kris Tallet, formerly 
known as Aigneis, the Sister of Children&#39;s Death, curled up on Jessica&#39;s 
bed together, topless. It was not late and Jessica did not feel very 
tired, but her body and mind felt was if it weighed a ton and the moment 
her head hit her pillow the very thought of moving was too much of an 
effort so she simply lay there, her head upon her pillow, and stared up 
at the ceiling. Memories of the past days event felt like a pile of lead 
in her head and she felt lost amongst them. Everything she had spent so 
much time trying to forget had come to surface again and she struggled 
with the urge to allow the sadness in her heart to envelop her, but that 
was not like her. She was stronger then all of this and had survived so 
much that she could not, would not; allow this to overcome her ever 
again. 

Slowly she turned her head upon the pillow to look upon the face that 
lay beside her and the deep blue eyes that returned her gaze. Kris had 
stayed at her side since she awoke from that nightmare and even after 
being questioned by Head Mistress Sophia and Nurse Amy, which felt more 
like an interrogation then simply inquiry as Sophia made Kima, Penny and 
herself explain what exactly happened inside of that nightmare and how 
it effected them. For herself she felt even more miserable since 
returning from that nightmare then before and Kris&#39;s presence was 
somewhat of a comfort, even with now knowing that the girl in fact used 
to be a Sister of Death. When they first returned to their room Jessica 
wanted nothing more then to make love to the girl, anything to forget 
the pain in her heart. The moment the door closed she pulled Kris into 
her arms and kissed her deeply, allowing her hands to roam over the 
girl&#39;s body and across the winged tattoo that marked the girl&#39;s back, 
but Kris put a stop it quickly. Jessica could see in Kris&#39;s eyes how 
much she wanted more and how much it pained her to stop things. This 
refusal made something break inside of Jessica and she finally crumbled, 
tears streamed across her cheeks and her knees buckled from under her as 
she let out an anguished scream. Kris never left her side even through 
the tears. She instead drew Jessica to her bed and curled up to the 
girl, holding her and stroking the buzzed cut sides of her head. 

Now Jessica stared into those beautiful blue eyes and allowed herself to 
lightly touched the girl upon the cheek, &quot;I... I&#39;m sorry...&quot; She 
apologized with a heavy sigh. 

Kris simply shook her head, &quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize.&quot; She replied 
softly, &quot;You had a rough day and it is understandable that you needed a 
good cry.&quot; 

Jessica lowered her eyes in shame, &quot;No... I mean...&quot; She could not bring 
herself to finish her sentence. 

Kris placed a hand under the girl&#39;s chin and raised it so she could look 
the girl in the eyes and smiled, &quot;You don&#39;t need to apologize for that 
either.&quot; 

Jessica licked her lips as an aching filled her chest and she had to 
break free from the girl&#39;s gaze, &quot;Yes I do.&quot; She stated miserably, &quot;I 
shouldn&#39;t have pushed myself on you like that... not after you and 
Jenn...&quot; 

Kris let out a sigh and rolled her head on her own pillow, covering her 
eyes with her arm, &quot;I should be the one apologizing. You deserve someone 
whose heart is not so muddled like mine. I&#39;m just going to hurt you in 
the end...&quot; 

Jessica shook her head, &quot;No matter who it is I&#39;ll be hurting.&quot; She 
rolled onto her back and placed her hands over her eyes, &quot;I wish this 
pain would go away. Why did I have to remember that crap?&quot; She said 
through grated teeth, &quot;I wish I never remembered her, maybe it wouldn&#39;t 
be so painful if I could just forget.&quot; 

Kris abruptly sat up and pulled Jessica&#39;s hands away from her eyes, 
&quot;Never say that!&quot; She snarled, glaring intensely at the girl below her.

Jessica cringed into her pillow, &quot;But... but I... I can&#39;t stand it...&quot; 
She replied and rubbed at the side of her head, &quot;Until today I thought I 
only loved one person, and that was you.&quot; Tears welled up in her eyes as 
the image of Amber entered her mind again and she had to turn away from 
Kris&#39;s gaze, &quot;I don&#39;t want to remember her love. I don&#39;t even know where 
she is anymore.&quot; She muttered miserably, &quot;What is the use of 
remembering, if it is going to just hurt this much?&quot; 

Kris released the girl&#39;s arm and leaned against the wall that ran the 
length of the bed, running a hand through her short, blue, curls, &quot;Do 
you want to talk about it?&quot; She offered lightly. 

Jessica shook her head, &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ll 
ever see her again so there is no reason I should dwell on it. I just 
want to forget it all happened and get on with life.&quot; She rolled on her 
side, looking across the small dorm room that they shared.

&quot;You realize if you ever want to get out of here you will have to face 
your past.&quot; Kris reminded the girl while softly stroking her back.  

Jessica let out a sigh; she had lived at Whispering Hills Academy for 
over six years now, six long years. Until a week ago she was nearing her 
release from the school. She had passed all her classes and was doing 
well personally as well, well that was if you did not take account of 
her actions with many of the girls in the dorm and her needed to loss 
herself in their soft flesh, she couldn&#39;t resist its call. That was 
until her little sister appeared at the school and the memories started 
flowing back to her, filling her dreams with nightmares. She tried her 
hardest to not allow those memories to invade her life again, told 
herself that she was over the past. While Head Mistress Sophia did 
reinstate her as one of the Western Dorm Heads, along side Kris, she was 
also informed that she would have to stay longer and this did not sit 
well in Jessica&#39;s heart. She thought this all over when there came a 
soft knocking at the door. 

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Kris called out from her spot on the bed.

&quot;Sophia.&quot; A voice replied from beyond the door, &quot;I am in need of 
Jessica&#39;s services.&quot; 

Jessica rolled over to blink up at Kris, &quot;My services?&quot; She inquired in 
confusion as she picked up her tank top from the ground near the bed, 
where she had thrown it in her hast to make love to Kris, and pulled it 
over her head. After what had happened that day she was half expecting 
the Head Mistresses to want nothing to do with her for the rest of her 
stay at the school and yet here she was. &quot;What does she mean by that?&quot; 
She asked Kris, thinking that since Sophia was Kris&#39;s Aunt that she 
might understand the woman a little more then anyone else at the school.

Kris simply shrugged, &quot;I have no idea. She is a mystery even too me. So 
there is only one way to find out.&quot; She remarked as she crawled over the 
girl, giving her a quick peck on the cheek before getting out of the 
bed, grabbing her long sleeved dress shirt from her bed and pulling it 
over her arms, leaving her bra exposed, before opening the door to allow 
the Head Mistress to enter. 

&quot;Evening Kris, Jessica.&quot; Sophia greeted the girls as she entered the 
room, leaning heavily upon an old wooden cane as she walked and slowly 
sat upon Kris&#39;s bed, opposite Jessica, whom was now sitting at the edge 
of her own bed. 

&quot;Evening Aunt Sophia.&quot; Kris returned as she sat beside Jessica, an arm 
protectively around the girl&#39;s waist. 

&quot;Evening.&quot; Jessica added, her eyes watching the Head Mistress carefully. 
The Head Mistress had seen better days and while she was looking better 
then she did earlier that day there were still heavy wrinkles carved 
around the corners of her mouth that Jessica was almost certain were not 
there the other day. Her fingers were also long and sunken, as if 
someone had drained the woman of all her youth, and this frightened 
Jessica. In all her years at the school she had never seen either of the 
Head Mistresses appearing anything but youthful. Whatever was happening 
to their school it was affecting the Head Mistress physically and this 
was a frightening thought because she could not think of life without 
Sophia or Melissa. 

Sophia smiled at the girl, crow&#39;s feet increasing around her warm blue 
eyes. &quot;There is no need to worry.&quot; She said knowingly, &quot;Everything will 
be alright.&quot; She stated patting the top of her cane hand with the other. 

Jessica suddenly realized she was staring and quickly glanced to the 
ground, &quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t notice before...&quot; 

Sophia shook her head slowly, &quot;No need to apologize. Anyhow, I&#39;m not 
here about that, I wish for you to accompany me to the Train Station. 
Melissa returned with files depicting that several new students will be 
arriving at the station in a bit and in my current state I am in no 
condition to help the new girls so I thought it would be best for one of 
the Dorm Heads to join me.&quot; 

&quot;Missy is back?&quot; Kris exclaimed excitedly, &quot;Is she going to stay? How is 
she?&quot; 

Sophia raised a hand and smiled at her niece&#39;s excitement and chuckled, 
&quot;She is resting after a journey to the Hall of Candles and the trip 
exhausted her, which is why I&#39;ve come for Jessica&#39;s assistance.&quot;

Jessica glanced at Kris, who returned her surprised gaze, and back to 
Sophia, &quot;But... Why me? I mean shouldn&#39;t Kris go?&quot; Jessica inquired 
bewilderly.

Sophia smiled at her niece, &quot;I think Kris will be better suited to stay 
here.&quot; She turned back to Jessica, &quot;and I thought maybe the drive and 
air would help clear your mind a bit. Your adventures today must have 
cluttered your mind a might bit and the air sometimes does the trick for 
clearing up muddled thoughts.&quot; 

Jessica thought about this for a moment, while the idea of a drive did 
sound like a grand idea she felt nervous about going somewhere alone 
with the Head Mistress. 

Sophia&#39;s smile broadened as if she was reading the girl&#39;s mind, &quot;I&#39;m not 
going to give you a lecture, or anything of that nature, if that is what 
you are afraid of. I just need you to meet the girls on the platform, 
nothing more.&quot; She assured the girl.

Kris nudged Jessica forward with her shoulder, &quot;Go on.&quot; She insisted, 
&quot;Maybe some air will help you.&quot; 

Jessica starred down at her hands in embarrassment, &quot;I don&#39;t know... 
I...&quot; 

Kris leaned in close to the girl, &quot;Were you not the one who told me to 
stop mopping around the room and do something? Well I&#39;m telling you the 
same now.&quot; 

Jessica turned to look at the girl, &quot;Do you think you can handle things 
here?&quot; She inquired worriedly, &quot;Things can get a little insane around 
here and with Kim&#39;s...&quot; 

Kris stood and pulled the girl to her feet, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about me. I can 
handle myself.&quot; She assured the girl, &quot;You just go and get some air.&quot; 

Sophia carefully stood and Kris rushed to the woman&#39;s side to help her 
up, &quot;Why thank you Kris.&quot; She accepted the girl&#39;s arm and stood up 
straight, pressing a hand to her back, &quot;Lords, I never felt this old 
before.&quot; She let out a small chuckle. 

&quot;You are not old.&quot; Kris remarked, &quot;You will be back to normal soon 
enough.&quot; She helped the woman into the hall, with Jessica at Sophia&#39;s 
other side, and the three of them began their way to the main lobby.
