~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Dragon&#39;s Breath Forest, outside Neo-China  

Three days. 

That&#39;s how long it took for Setsuya to reach Neo-China. It was quite the 
little journey. After the funeral of the old master at the Yuuga school, 
both Setsuya and Aarin left once more to take care of their futures. To 
prepare themselves for whatever might be coming their way. While Aarin 
left for Thailand to seek out a decent challenge, Setsuya decided that 
he would go to Neo-China. For training and... more or less, to see 
Lin-Lin. 

Even as the Neo-Japanese swordsman strode through the forests of China 
towards the village that Lin-Lin resided in; Setsuya couldn&#39;t help but 
grin from thinking of her. Lin-Lin was the kind of girl that you did not 
meet everyday. Friendly, polite, charming, sweet, and most of all (in 
Setsuya&#39;s opinion) she was gorgeous. Most of the women that Setsuya had 
&#39;corrupted&#39; with his love were just flirty or dull. For Lin-Lin; she was 
neither. And that made Setsuya quite proud really. A girl like that 
could have anyone she wanted, but Lin-Lin had eyes only for Setsuya. 

&quot;Hmmm. Kinda nice out today,&quot; 

Setsuya looked around the skies of this place. It was quite a sunny day. 
Which was unusual, because he was outside of the Safe Zone. The sky was 
usually quite dark and foreboding in this part of the world, even during 
the day. No-one knew exactly why this was, but the bulk of Asia often 
had elongated nights. Sometimes night could last for over 4 days. You 
really didn&#39;t have to  be a rocket scientist to know that it had 
something to do with the Genesis Comet. After all, even though the comet 
landed over thirty years ago, it was still quite active. Though the 
comet itself had plunged into the ice and water of the Northern Arctic, 
it radiated waves of radiation that somehow seeped over the planet. For 
some reason this did not effect human beings, at least not on a short 
term scale, but it greatly effected the remains of the planet. It wasn&#39;t 
just the weather that was effected. The forests of China were a good 
example. The vegetation had been altered over the years. Much larger 
were the trees that surrounded Setsuya. Much larger were the animals and 
insects that scuttled through and around those trees. Whether it was the 
changing of colour or growth in size, or increased attributes, much of 
the flora and fauna of this world had been changed.  

Setsuya took one last look at the clear skies before continuing his 
journey toward Lin-Lin&#39;s village, which was nestled to the east in this 
vast forest. He kept going for over an hour until he reached a hill, 
which overlooked the village itself. Setsuya remembered this, and 
eagerly ran up that hill to see the village itself. The Japanese youth 
barged through the bushes and plants in his way, then leapt up onto the 
hill. He ran all the way up it, hung over the horizon of the Forest of 
Dragon&#39;s Breath. But as he cast his eyes downwards to the village 
itself, the picture he received was less than comforting. More like 
troubling.

The village was in flames.

&quot;Damn!&quot; Setsuya cursed under his breath, &quot;What the hell is going on?&quot;

It was impossible for Setsuya to know what was happening. From his 
position, all he could see were wooden houses burning in hot flame, 
people screaming and babies crying. Smoke was beginning to rise up into 
the air from the fires. And as a wind blew into the forest, it carried 
with it embers. Embers which passed the fire on to more houses and huts. 
This fire ultimately would pass into the forest itself if something was 
not done to stop it. But what bothered Setsuya more was that people were 
screaming in places that were not afflicted with flames. The Japanese 
youth cast his eyes toward those areas a bit harder. He could hardly see 
anything through all the smoke that was still rising up, but people were 
running around the huts and wells, being chased and killed by what 
looked like soldiers. Those soldiers were all dressed in the combat gear 
of the late 20th Century, colours of green, brown and black working as a 
sort of camouflage. Setsuya was even more alarmed when he saw something 
else at the edge of the forest. 

&quot;Is that a...?&quot; Setsuya squinted to look at it, &quot;... A helicopter?&quot; 

He had heard of such technology from his master, but had never actually 
seen one before. Transportation of that sort was apparently common for 
military use in the 21st Century. But what would something like that be 
doing here? During the landing of the Genesis Comet, a wave of force 
swept across the earth and damaged almost all electrical technology with 
an almost paralysing effect. It was considered that no one in the world 
had the man power or the resources to rebuild that which was lost. So 
how on earth could someone use a helicopter? What people would have that 
kind of money and influence?

Setsuya could waste no time. He had to put a stop to this before anyone 
else got hurt. It had not escaped his mind that Lin-Lin was in the 
middle of all that mayhem. The young man gathered momentum into himself, 
then ran up the remaining distance of the hill. He then vaulted upwards 
and landed downwards, into a running stride. Setsuya galloped down the 
hill as fast as his nimble legs would allow. He was not too far from 
Lin-Lin&#39;s village now. He kept pacing towards his destination and soon 
Setsuya reached ground level, at the front section of the village. 

The Yuuga-student gripped the hilt of his sword, the sleek katana called 
Tetsuzanko, and then drew it from the sheath at his waist. Gripping the 
hilt with both hands, he charged forwards into the panic. The first 
thing he saw was one of those attacking soldiers about hack down an old 
woman. Setsuya focussed himself and ran for those two. The soldier 
looked over his shoulder in a daze as he saw Setsuya charging him, 
screaming zealously, 

&quot;Graaaaaah!&quot;

Setsuya instantly ran past the soldier and slashed, cutting the blade he 
was holding in half. The soldier blinked at his hacked weapon, then 
looked over at the Seisuji-boy, who was more than willing to do some 
damage to *him* as well. But Setsuya was not about to give this guy a 
chance to get away. The Japanese swordsman ran up to him once more, then 
struck the soldier across the head with butt of Tetsuzanko. The soldier 
gasped and instantly lost consciousness, collapsing into a heap on the 
floor. But Setsuya ignored him and kneeled down to the trembling old 
woman whom he had just saved. 

Resting a hand on her shoulder, he said, &quot;What the hell is going on 
here? Who on earth are these guys?&quot; 

&quot;I... mm... I...! S-Sword! ... I...&quot;

Nothing but babble. This woman was too frightened to say anything of any 
worth. Setsuya stood up and looked over into the village. A group of 
soldiers had gathered together, which seemed to fill the bulk of their 
attack forces. After speaking loudly to themselves, then all ran back to 
the helicopter from which they had obviously originated from. Setsuya 
would have gone after them, but he wasn&#39;t stupid. There were at least 25 
of those soldiers. Him on his own would not have stood a chance on his 
own. A few stragglers from their group ran into the helicopter just as 
the others did, aside from the one Setsuya had knocked out. The young 
man noted just how bloodstained their swords were. He just hoped to God 
that none of that blood belonged to Lin-Lin. Dust was scattered across 
the ground as the blades of the helicopter began to spin around and 
around, until it slowly began to rise from the ground. Setsuya watched 
as some of the villagers gathered together around it and began throwing 
stones at the &#39;iron bird&#39;. 

He couldn&#39;t imagine why people with such technology would want to harm 
an innocent village like this. These folks spent most of their time 
farming and living off the land. What possible threat could they pose? 
Nonetheless, this atrocity had been committed and Setsuya had to do 
something to make sure that Lin-Lin was okay. The Japanese boy sheathed 
Tetsuzanko then ran through the burning village. Past all the charred 
huts and injured men, towards the north. As soon as the helicopter was 
out of sight, people started to emerge. Setsuya barged past all of them 
and headed for the Elder&#39;s house. The village elder was Lin-Lin&#39;s 
grandfather. If anywhere, she had to be with him. The Elder&#39;s place was 
one of the few locales that had not been burned. Setsuya ran up to it 
and brutally kicked the door open. 

&quot;Lin-Lin!?&quot;

No answer. But Setsuya was not alone in that room. Inside was the 
village elder. He was laid out across the straw mat at the centre of the 
large wooden manor, blood seeping down his forehead and his clothes 
ripped in bits. Setsuya ran to him and kneeled down, checking his 
condition. The 19-year-old placed two fingers at the older man&#39;s neck. 
He was alive. 

&quot;Elder!&quot; Setsuya yelled loudly, &quot;Elder! Wake up! Where is Lin-Lin?&quot;

The village elder managed to open his eyes a bit... &quot;Hmmm... 
S-Setsuya...?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me!&quot; The youth nodded in conformation. And although Setsuya 
was pleased that the elder had remembered him from five months ago, he 
was more focussed on the current panic. &quot;Where is Lin-Lin? Is she with 
you?&quot;

Tears began to roll from the older man&#39;s eyes at the thought. &quot;Oh... my 
poor sweet grandchild...&quot;

&quot;What happened to her?!&quot; Setsuya shot back loudly. 

&quot;...They took her...&quot; The Elder said tragically, &quot;...T-They&#39;ve taken my 
dear child from us...&quot;

Though he did not realize it, Setsuya&#39;s fists were gripping together 
tightly. Lin-Lin had been caught in all that panic after all. But why? 
Why Lin-Lin? What would a sweet girl like her have to do with those 
cowardly soldiers? Setsuya tried not to get too angry or depressed about 
Lin-Lin&#39;s capture. The Master had always told him to keep a tight grip 
on the reins of that impulsiveness of his. Setsuya did just that, taking 
a deep breath and calming down. If nothing more, he had to get to the 
bottom of this. Then maybe he would understand the situation a little 
better. 

&quot;Why did they take her?&quot; That was said in calm anger, but Setsuya 
managed to keep cool about this situation. It was all he could do at 
this point. &quot;What is she to them?&quot;

The Elder coughed. &quot;N-Nothing... she means nothing to them... but... she 
is important to me. T-That is why... they kidnapped her... as a 
bargaining chip... for the sword...&quot;

&quot;...A sword?&quot; Setsuya blinked frantically, &quot;All this for a stupid 
sword?&quot;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Kuki &amp; Mari&#39;s, Izabura Shopping Arcade, District Nine, Nagoya, Neo-Japan

The Dark Katana let out an anxious breath. After becoming a near-enough 
mercenary, she had grown a little tough streak to her. Despite her 
feminine looks, she had a particularly masculine temperament. Which was 
one of the main reasons she was having such a hard time coping with 
this. Shopping with Julia. It had been decided between the two of them 
that she needed a new set of clothes, something other than that ratty 
science experiment frock she had been wearing for the past few hours. 
Even though it meant dipping into the initial payment Ayame had received 
from Simon, what choice did she have? She had to take proper care of her 
charge, especially if she wanted the rest of that cash. So Ayame had 
taken Julia with her to one of the main high streets of Nagoya. They 
ended up in a place called Izabura. A shopping plaza with a healthy 
number of fellow shoppers around. Ayame and Julia had been touring 
around the place for about five hours now. Buzzing all through the shops 
and stalls, the malls, stopping every now and again to refresh 
themselves with a drink. It was a nice climate around here, considering 
the suffering that the Genesis Comet caused. There were hardly any 
beggars, most people were well dressed, there was little litter and most 
of all, there were no troubles caused by fights. It was one of the safer 
areas of Nagoya. And Nagoya was a safe city in general, if you compared 
it to something like Tokyo. Arguably the harshest city of the 
Neo-Japanese Safe Zone to live in. 

By now Ayame and Julia had come to a particular clothes shop, called 
Kuki &amp; Mari&#39;s. It was a Japanese shop that sold western-inspired 
clothing at the most. Just what Julia had been looking for. Not that she 
had a problem with Japanese clothing overall... but she felt more 
comfortable in something knew about. But, in any case, she was just 
happy to get out of that bland frock she was forced to wear in the 
Bio-Technological Research Department. The sooner she got rid of it, the 
sooner she could put that whole ordeal behind her. Ayame stood at the 
back of the shop beside three small compartments, meant for changing. 
With her eyes shut and her arms crossed, she waited impatiently for 
Julia to come out, as if she hadn&#39;t been in there long enough. 

Her left foot tapped repeatedly in irritation. &quot;...Julia! How the hell 
long are you gonna take?! What are you doing in there?!&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m just changing,&quot; Julia replied with delay, &quot;please be a little 
patient, Ayame. And I really appreciate what you&#39;ve done for me today. I 
know my Father will thank you for this too.&quot;

Ayame opened her eyes. &quot;Well he can show his appreciation by just 
handing me the cash I&#39;m owed. Then I can finally get back to the better 
pursuits. By the way, we need to stop at a market before we get back to 
the Hikoukuji Inn.&quot;

&quot;What for?&quot; Julia asked simply. 

&quot;I need to pick up some rubbing acid,&quot; Ayame replied, running a hand 
through her raven black bangs, &quot;It&#39;s the most effective way to sharpen 
my sword, strangely enough. And I could do with a bite to eat as well. 
I&#39;m starving right now...&quot;

No reply came to that particular comment. Instead, the small, slightly 
battered cloth that covered the opening parted to one side along the 
thin metal pipe it had been attached to over the dressing room. Julia 
revealed herself in that instant, brandishing one of the four dresses 
she had picked out from this particular shop. It was a lengthy 
one-piece, the colour of pearl white, one that dangled around the lower 
half of her knees with a charming allure. The light creamy tone of the 
dress mixed brilliantly with Julia&#39;s rainfall of chestnut hair, giving 
her a rich quality that even Ayame took notice of. The Dark Katana 
blinked in surprise, eying Julia up and down, sparing no glance to 
conjecture. Ayame had known that Julia was pretty from when they first 
met up with each other. But this was the first time that Julia went 
beyond that. She was beautiful. Back in the lab, she looked so worn out, 
so strained, regardless of her Ashidah vitality. Now that she was out 
and about, she looked gorgeous. Natural. Maybe more than Ayame even 
realized at that point alone. 

&quot;Well?&quot; Julia prodded, now smiling, &quot;Don&#39;t just stand there staring at 
me. How do I look?&quot;

Ayame blushed a little. Julia&#39;s hotness was now dawning on her. 
&quot;...Um... you look... amazing. Really. So... are you gonna buy that or 
what?&quot;

Julia took another look at the dress she wore. &quot;I assume so. If you&#39;re 
willing to buy this for me then I&#39;d love it. But I won&#39;t wear it out 
though. I think I should wear something else.&quot;

&quot;...Sure.&quot; Said Ayame. Julia nodded to her with a smile, and strode back 
into the changing room with all her stuff in it. The Scottish woman slid 
the cloth back across the gap and began humming a little folk ballad to 
herself. Ayame tightened up inside and hazarded a gaze down at the 
carpeted floor of the shop. Or more closely to the lower half of Julia&#39;s 
changing room. The cloth that kept Julia&#39;s actions wasn&#39;t so lengthy, 
concealing her body from view only from the head to the knees. Therefore 
everything below the knees was in full view of whoever happened to be 
outside the room. Which at this point, was Ayame. The blush over her 
cheeks grew in hue as the lower half of Julia&#39;s thin legs and dainty 
feet were exposed. The cream white dress that she had been wearing fell 
to a little pile around her ankles, causing Ayame to realize that she 
was near enough naked in there. Ayame held a hand over her face and 
heaved a groan. This situation was becoming complicated. Through the 
brief planning that the Dark Katana had made for this mission, she had 
not expected to be attracted to the girl she was being paid to rescue. 
But she was just so gorgeous... especially now that she had begun to 
loosen up a bit. And that delightfully quaint accent did nothing to help 
matters either. 

Ayame shook her head, whispering to herself. &quot;No. I gotta keep this 
thing in check. Simon&#39;s paying to take care of his daughter... and I&#39;m 
just in it for the money. The money. I just have to keep that in 
mind...&quot;

The cloth slid open again, revealing Julia, dressed now in a denim 
shorts (sheared at the leg holes), a sunflower yellow chest top 
(exposing her midriff) and a pair of white/black mix trainers, giving 
her a sort of on the go, casual look. It took away the romantic aspect 
of Julia&#39;s beauty, that was for sure. But did nothing to ease the 
outright sexiness of her. Ayame looked away briefly and hoped that her 
cheeks wouldn&#39;t give her away. 

&quot;As soon as we buy that gear,&quot; She began, &quot;...we&#39;re heading to the 
market to pick up my rubbing acid, alright?&quot;

Julia nodded brightly. &quot;Yes, Ayame.&quot;

Which now added an air of cuteness to her. Great. Just great. Ayame 
sighed to herself, un-crossed her arms and began walking to the front 
checkout desk of the shop. If nothing else, this mission certainly 
wasn&#39;t uneventful.

Mazda Family Training Camp, Fuzhou, Neo-China 

&quot;Greetings, my child.&quot;

Ming Lo Mazda let her head rise, but stayed in her kneeling position; so 
that she might be able to get a better look at her grandfather. He was 
the same as she remembered him from long ago. Still haughty, still 
quiet. But the look in his eyes was far less than quiet. His were eyes 
that screamed their agonies. Ahura Mazda was neck-deep in the troubles 
that were now bringing his family to its knees. 

Ming Lo finally found the voice to speak. &quot;Grandfather... I have finally 
returned from my years of training in Neo-Japan. But now that I return I 
see that the climate of this place has  gone into disarray. Please tell 
me. What is it that troubles you?&quot; 

&quot;Have you not heard...?&quot; Ahura questioned, his voice slow with age. 

&quot;Heard of what, Grandfather?&quot;

&quot;It has finally happened,&quot; Ahura said with a sad smile, &quot;After two and a 
half millennia of being undefeated... the Mazda Family has finally 
failed mission.&quot;

Ming Lo gasped. &quot;I... it cannot be! We are invincible! What force could 
hope to stand against the might of the illustrious Mazda Family! Nothing 
can contest us!&quot;

&quot;Nothing is invincible, Ming Lo,&quot; Ahura lowered his gaze to the red 
carpet that led up to his rather large throne. &quot;And the Mazda Family has 
finally become aware of this. I myself would have never imagined that we 
could defeated. But this crisis has opened my eyes to the truth. The 
world is changing. The citizens of this world grow in power because they 
fear for their safety. The Mazda Family seems to falling behind in this 
growth. Our first ever failure in an assassination proves that.&quot;

&quot;...Then who failed us?&quot; Ming Lo hated to ask the question, but...

Ahura breathed a sigh of great weight. &quot;Your older brother, Ahura Li. 
His mission was to kill a politician of the Neo World Federation. He did 
not accomplish it, and was caught out. He managed to escape from the 
clutches of the authorities... but Ahura Li has not returned to the 
Mazda Training Camp. I assume he is on the run from the Neo World 
Federation... but those who fail the Mazda Family are eternally banished 
from its order. We have never had to banish one of our own before 
because we have never to assassinate a target failed before. But this 
time, well... I suppose it shows that Ahura Li was well versed in my 
teachings. It is just thankful that he was not using Airget-Lam at the 
time. That would have tarnished this family beyond that which it might 
recover from. Fortunately, that was not the case.&quot;

&quot;Ahura Li...&quot; Ming Lo said silently. She would have never believed that 
he could fail a mission. Amongst all members of the Mazda Family, Ahura 
Mazda, (Ahura) Ho, (Ahura) Chun and Ming Lo, Ahura Li was the most 
capable now. Though he was not as skilled as their grandfather, Ahura Li 
had great vitality and strength. How could he have failed a mission? &quot;I 
do no believe this...&quot;

Ahura shook his head. &quot;It is true. This is why the state of affairs have 
gotten so desperate at the Training Camp. Others have lost faith in the 
power of the Mazda Family. So they do not wish to train at this academy 
any longer.&quot;

Ming Lo looked up to her grandfather. &quot;You are right, Grandfather. The 
only reason we have failed is because we are falling behind in the 
times. We need to change ourselves! If you would just allow me to-&quot;

&quot;Stop right there!&quot; Ahura said, halting her. &quot;I know that which you wish 
to say. And I have already told you. The answer is no.&quot;

Ming Lo lowered her eyes at her grandfather&#39;s anger. &quot;But why...?&quot;

&quot;It is the law of the Mazda Family. Our 2500-year custom. No woman will 
ever take her place as a member of the first assassin line. Only men may 
assassinate in the name of the Mazda Family. You and all other female 
members of the Mazda before you, were only taught the powers to kill as 
a form of self-defence. Women must know their place. As nurturers and as 
wombs from which the fruits of the new foundation are born. Beyond those 
needs, women will not participate in the way of the Mazda.&quot;

She could not believe her grandfather&#39;s misogyny. &quot;Please, Grandfather? 
I know that the inclusion of women into the first assassin line would 
benefit the Family. My skills surpass all those who were in my class at 
the Japanese training camp. I know that if I am given a chance, I could 
prove myself as equal to any one of my three brothers.&quot;

Ahura shook his head. &quot;This is not a matter of discussion, Ming Lo. I 
will repeat myself. Your duty as a woman of the Mazda Family is to 
continue our bloodline and raise strong offspring from your womb. A 
woman must know her place in the Mazda Family. Though I take no pleasure 
in denying your wishes, I must enforce our laws. I must make you aware 
of the ways of our Family. No matter how much you wish it, females will 
never lead this family, carry our sacred Airget-Lam, or be apart of the 
assassin lines. It is the way we have existed for thousands of years.&quot;

&quot;I... understand, grandfather.&quot; Though Ming Lo did not like this, she 
had no choice but to accept it. Ahura Long Mazda was one of the most 
respected assassins worldwide. Even if his family had suffered their 
first failure, it would not affect his popularity. For Ming Lo, 
challenging his authority was an impossible battle. And at the same 
time, this man was her grandfather. What could she do but grudgingly 
accept his wishes? 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Shougatsu Financial Group HQ, Munich, Neo-Germany

A frown was cast from Zephaniah&#39;s face as he looked out at flourishing 
city of Munich from the window of his top floor office. Below him were 
roads that had been rebuilt from the previous destruction it had 
suffered at the hands of the Genesis Comet. People had adjusted well 
here. Mainly because Neo-Germany was one of the first Safe-Zone ever 
built. Thusly it received more work on it than most of the others. It 
was strange for Zephaniah to see all those people living their lives so 
normally. Like it was just another day. To him, life was a constant 
struggle. One had to stay on their toes to keep a clear head. If you let 
your guard down for even an instant, you were assisting your own 
suicide. 

&quot;This is why they do not belong,&quot; Zephaniah whispered to himself, &quot;They 
who lack the wits to see that this world is falling apart. A strong hand 
is needed to bring this planet from the brink of obliteration.&quot;

Zephaniah looked down to his gloved hand, saying, &quot;My iron fist will 
cleave the world toward that which we desired most, Diana... I swear 
this to you. Once you are at my side again... my hands will mould the 
future of the world towards an new Eden. Even if I must do so by 
staining my hands with blood.&quot;

At that point, a young secretary walked through the door into his 
office. The door was open for some reason. The woman walked up to the 
desk of her leader, clipboard in hand. She was actually quite fearful of 
Zephaniah, mostly for his quick temper and mystic gaze. 

&quot;Master,&quot; She said respectfully, &quot;I am sorry to disturb you at this 
point in time. But I have a report to make on the issues of the Second 
Origin Project and the Four Sword retrieval.&quot;

Zephaniah did not look back. &quot;Speak. What news do you bring me?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; The woman looked down at her notes, attached to the clipboard, 
&quot;The scientists working on the Second Origin Project have made 
significant progress in the last four days. Though the previous four 
test subjects, Aurora Rose, Oshizu Yabame, Hendolf Dauchen Ziegfried and 
Gaeladria have all been announced as failures; the project team believe 
that they have perfected their technology enough to being the first 
official body for the Deities.&quot;

To that, Zephaniah turned around. &quot;...H-Have they started work on 
Diana?&quot;

&quot;No sir,&quot; The secretary replied. &quot;For two reasons. One, they wanted your 
approval first, and two, they believed that the labs on the floating 
city of Nazareth would have provided a better location for the first 
serious run of Second Origin Project.&quot;

&quot;They have my consent,&quot; The large Neo-Englishman said, &quot;But they will 
need the four sacred swords to complete the project, will they not? How 
goes the search for the swords?&quot;

&quot;Our forces are having scattered success and failure. We have succeeded 
finding the Shadow Edge under the ice of the Arctic, within the Genesis 
Comet. But the agents stationed there are having much difficulty in 
retrieving it. We lost track of the Lightning Tooth yesterday, we 
believe that Ingrid Highland has left the Neo-English city, Manchester, 
for reasons unknown. The Wind Soul still has yet to be located, and our 
Neo-Chinese troops failed in procuring the Fire Cutter sword a short 
time ago. It is expected that all four of the swords will be in our 
possession in three weeks if we expend as much effort as possible.&quot;

There was a irritated growl after that. &quot;...I&#39;m not pleased with the 
lack the swords. Especially after the chaos of the last board meeting. 
But I will reframe. Finding four small needles in a haystack the size of 
a planet is not an easy task. It seems I have no choice but use the back 
up plan.&quot;

&quot;Really, sir?&quot; The female secretary asked.

Zephaniah nodded to her. &quot;Yes. I don&#39;t believe we have any other 
options. I will not allow the Second Origin Project to be delayed any 
further. And I must crush the doubters that exist amongst the board 
members. We will have to hasten the Ten Sekai Sentou Kyousou. I want you 
to issue out the tournament invitations now. As quickly as you can. My 
other secretaries will brief you on the details of location and date.&quot;

The woman nodded, then turned and walked away. She really had not 
expected to hear that. As the door closed behind her when she left, a 
figure appeared from the shadows of the office. That figure was of 
Nagare Utsume. 

&quot;Well done,&quot; He said to Zephaniah, &quot;It was a wise decision to bring your 
tournament closer. This way, instead of seeking out the wielders of the 
swords, the wielders of the swords will come to you.&quot;

Zephaniah looked away from him. &quot;This also means work on the Second 
Origin Project will not be complete until the tournament begins. And I 
have waited so long already...&quot;

&quot;Patience,&quot; Nagare replied, &quot;Happiness makes itself known to those who 
prepare for it. But also to those who have the courage to wait for it. 
It is your destiny to host that tournament and to see the Second Origin
