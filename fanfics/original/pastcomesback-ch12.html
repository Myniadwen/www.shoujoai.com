<h1>The Past Always Comes Back (part 12 of 46)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../original/index.html">Original Fiction</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/slayergirl.html">slayer girl</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../original/pastcomesback-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>      Krystal didn&#39;t feel so good now. Granted, it was upsetting to hear about your lover&#39;s 
exploits from a girl she once slept with and said girl becoming a new found friend and a 
kind person and maybe she&#39;d always known Isaka to be a bit... well, to have skeletons in her 
closet... but it was just too much for one girl to take!

      Maybe that&#39;s why she ran out of the apartment in a fury, upset and insecure. What 
if... what if all the problems Tsuru had were going to be problems she had? Then again... it 
wasn&#39;t like Tsuru knew Krystal was dating Isaka, so the blue haired girl wasn&#39;t doing it 
purposefully... and Isaka would never do anything to hurt her.

      The demon was probably curled up in a ball in the bed, fretting about Krystal. The 
blonde woman let out a sigh and wiped at her tears. She, of course, chose to go to a place 
where she knew Isaka couldn&#39;t find her. Krystal felt silly, standing at the steps of the 
shrine, the moon illuminating her path.

      She heard a slight gasp and turned to see Hoshi staring at her. It took a minute for 
the silver haired woman to relax.

      &quot;Krystal... you startled me. I thought you were an angel in the moonlight,&quot; Hoshi 
said, giving her a slight smile. She was dressed in her pajamas, her hair down, presumably 
taking a stroll outside. Her smile faded when she noticed the blonde was crying. &quot;...do you 
want to come inside?&quot;

      Krystal only nodded and the older woman guided her into the shrine, not saying 
anything, until they arrived at Hoshi&#39;s room. Instead of turning on the light, Hoshi left 
her window open, able to see with the light of the moon.

      &quot;I&#39;m sorry for coming so suddenly,&quot; Krystal murmured.

      &quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine. How about you stay the night?&quot; Hoshi said, going over to a closet. 
She pulled out a pair of pajamas and gave them to Krystal. &quot;These should fit.&quot;

      The silver haired woman sat down on the bed, as Krystal changed. She was looking out 
the window, much to the blonde&#39;s relief. &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;

      The question startled Krystal a bit, who was in the middle of pulling up her pants. 
Hoshi&#39;s sympathetic gold-like eyes were staring right at her. Krystal sat down next to her 
on the bed.

      &quot;Well, I... my girlfriend, you see, she&#39;s been with a lot of other girls before me. 
Not that she&#39;s a... I recently met another girl who coincidently was once in a relationship 
with my girlfriend and when I found out what had happened between them...&quot; Krystal stopped 
when she felt Hoshi pull her into a hug.

      &quot;It&#39;s alright - you said it happened in the past, didn&#39;t you? Your girlfriend would be 
a fool to let someone as great as you slip away,&quot; Hoshi murmured, wiping at Krystal&#39;s tears. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry so much. Even if the worse happens, another door will open and you&#39;ll find 
someone else.&quot;

      Krystal only nodded and kept crying. &quot;But... I just worry so much and I shouldn&#39;t 
because that&#39;s not how it should be...!&quot;

      Hoshi spent the next hour soothing the blonde until she drifted off into a deep sleep. 
The older woman lied down next to her, cradling the sleeping beauty. It wasn&#39;t long until 
there was a knock at the door. Hoshi let out a sigh, unhappy to be away from Krystal.

      When she opened the door, a flushed and disillusioned Tsuki was leaning against the 
doorframe. &quot;...Hoshi... me and Hina...&quot; The brunette&#39;s request trailed off when she saw 
another girl in her sister&#39;s bed.

      &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her, Tsuki,&quot; Hoshi said, cupping her sister&#39;s chin to look in her 
eyes. &quot;Let&#39;s just say a pretty little bird flew into my lap. What were you saying about you 
and Hina?&quot;

      &quot;Ah... she... she&#39;s asking me for things I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t-&quot; Tsuki&#39;s eyes swerved over 
to Krystal again so Hoshi stepped out of the room. She closed the door behind her before 
giving Tsuki a once over.

      &quot;You&#39;re still hesitant?&quot; Hoshi frowned. &quot;What did I say about denying your little 
sister of what she wants?&quot;

      &quot;B-but I feel like I shouldn&#39;t and - and... Hoshi...! Please, it hurts, it hurts 
inside and I don&#39;t know why it does!&quot; Tsuki half-shouted, starting to sob again.

      Hoshi pulled her into a hug and moved them down the hall to Hina&#39;s room. &quot;Look at you 
- you&#39;ve been fighting it, haven&#39;t you? That&#39;s why it hurts, Tsuki. Stop fighting and just 
give in to the feeling, to our fate.&quot;

      The brunette was still crying when they entered Hina&#39;s room. The little girl awoke and 
looked confused at Tsuki&#39;s tears. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Tsuki, big sister?&quot;

      &quot;She&#39;s always been the disobedient one, Hina. Has she been giving you trouble again?&quot; 
Hoshi asked, making the brunette lie down on the bed.

      &quot;Hmm, kind of. She keeps crying and telling me it&#39;s wrong. Is it wrong? Why does she 
keep saying that?&quot;

      Hoshi shook her head and smoothed out Hina&#39;s blonde hair. &quot;No, no it&#39;s not. Tsuki&#39;s 
just been confused lately... but it&#39;s alright. Don&#39;t let her lead you off the path, okay? Or 
else you&#39;ll get sick and punished.&quot;

      Tsuki&#39;s sobbing went up an octave, but she continued to lie there, even as her big 
sister stood over her. &quot;Now watch Hina. You&#39;re not allowed to cover your eyes this time.&quot;

      The little girl nodded solemnly, sitting up. Hoshi wiped away Tsuki&#39;s tears. &quot;Don&#39;t 
cry, pretty little moon. Your punishment will be swift then you will be back to the way you 
should be.&quot; 

***** 

      When Krystal awoke, she found that it was still nighttime... 3:42 am in fact. Hoshi 
wasn&#39;t in bed next to her, something she found very surprising. Just as she was ready to go 
back to bed, she heard something.

      The blonde sat up and quickly surveyed the room. There was nothing there, but the 
sound came again. It was a bit a ways away, but since the shrine was only one floor, she 
couldn&#39;t exactly pinpoint it. What could it be?

      She figured that a little nighttime adventure would be better than moping around 
here... Krystal slipped out of the room, listening for the sound. She crept down the hallway 
and turned right as soon as she heard it again. It... it sounded like a moan...

      How odd. The blonde continued on her path, the sound getting a bit louder, now 
sounding like a slight scrape. She found herself in a small room, a trapdoor in the middle 
of it. The sound was coming from the basement... Krystal braced herself and pulled it open. 
As she descended the stairs and listened for the sound, she was surprised at how well kept 
it was.

      There were no cobwebs, dust or random things lying around. The place was neatly kept, 
scrolls, books, weapons, artifacts and boxes were neatly arranged. Krystal could imagine the 
three sisters cleaning everything up...

      But where was that sound coming from? Krystal flicked on the light, seeing nothing in 
the room...

      Yet the sound was louder now - as though something needed help. She couldn&#39;t feel a 
presence, but there was something there. Just as she spied a door hidden behind a bookcase-

      Something wrapped around her waist and Krystal shrieked, until a hand muffled her cry.

      &quot;Shhh,&quot; came a familiar, soothing voice. &quot;What are you doing down here?&quot;

      Krystal relaxed in her captors arms. Hoshi let her go and turned her around. &quot;Sorry, I 
keep hearing something moan down here,&quot; the blonde said.

      Hoshi looked confused than looked over at the door behind the bookcase. &quot;Oh, an animal 
probably got trapped in that room again... or maybe the wood is creaking? We keep that door 
blocked off because a flood happened a while ago and we just haven&#39;t had the time to fix the 
room.&quot;

      Hoshi let out a sigh and started to push aside the bookcase. &quot;You stay here, Krystal. 
This room can get... nasty...&quot; She gave the girl a small smile before slipping into the 
room.

      There was a sound of shuffling, moving things around and a long, dull sound. Hoshi 
appeared a few minutes later, the sleeves of her pajamas now black with dirt. &quot;It was an old 
wooden box creaking in there,&quot; Hoshi said, almost laughing at Krystal&#39;s still frightened 
face. &quot;I promise we aren&#39;t keeping monsters in the back room. Wanna take a look?&quot;

      &quot;No, no, I&#39;m sure you aren&#39;t,&quot; Krystal said, a smile returning to her face. The women 
started back up the stairs and as Hoshi closed the trapdoor, Krystal said, &quot;I think I should 
go back home now.&quot;

      Hoshi just gave her a startled look. &quot;Really? It&#39;s early in the morning, but if you 
really want to...&quot;

      Krystal nodded. &quot;Yeah, I was planning to go back into town and call my girlfriend. 
There&#39;s still... well, her ex still hasn&#39;t finished the story and you&#39;re right. I shouldn&#39;t 
worry about these things because I know my girlfriend loves me.&quot;

      Hoshi gave her a smile. &quot;Then at least let me walk you out.&quot; 

***** 

      &quot;Of course I&#39;ll come pick you!&quot; Tsuru let out a sigh. She&#39;d passed out on the floor of 
the apartment after her and Isaka engaged in a casual fistfight. Tsuru meant casual as in no 
real injuries and no powers and no weapons and no damage to the furniture. Isaka, who had 
previously fallen asleep on a chair in the kitchen, was now ecstatic to hear Krystal on the 
phone.

      &quot;...and yes, I will bring Tsuru along...&quot; the demon murmured, unhappy at the second 
condition. She looked over at the blue haired girl, who was standing up on her feet. The 
phone call ended and the demon gave Tsuru a sour look.

      &quot;You are such a pain in the ass. Remind me why I chased your skirt for so long?&quot; Isaka 
asked, getting up from the chair.

      &quot;Of course I&#39;m a pain in the ass - it was the only way to get you to stay away!&quot; Tsuru 
let out a long moan. &quot;Can we just go pick up Krystal?&quot; 

***** 

      Krystal knew that the pair had arrived at the convenience store when she heard to 
females yelling outside. The blonde decided to take advantage of the 24 hour store, purchase 
something to eat and wait for them to arrive.

      When they say her through the door, Tsuru and Isaka tried to pretend they weren&#39;t 
fighting. Out of the corner of her eye, Krystal could see the bored cashier shaking his 
head.

      &quot;Krystal, I&#39;m so sorry about everything,&quot; Isaka started rushing over to her 
girlfriend.

      &quot;And I didn&#39;t mean to cause you so much trouble...&quot; Tsuru murmured, feeling guilty for 
hurting the blonde&#39;s feelings.

      &quot;No, no, it&#39;s fine... in fact, I want you to finish your story Tsuru,&quot; Krystal said 
with a small smile. Isaka looked less than please.

      &quot;Are... are you sure...?&quot; Isaka asked. &quot;If Tsuru is going to tell the next part, 
then...&quot; The demon grimaced. The next part would be when they first met...

      &quot;I guess I get to tell you about the time we ran into Carmilla,&quot; Tsuru said, looking 
almost as thrilled as Isaka.

      &quot;Alright, sounds good,&quot; Krystal said, not knowing who they were talking about. &quot;How 
about you tell us on our way back home?&quot; 

***** 

      Tsuru had been doing a phenomenal job of avoiding Isaka for the next three or four 
years, constantly escaping the demon. She&#39;d move quickly from town to town, spread rumors of 
her whereabouts and even hide in forests. It wasn&#39;t fun, but it was necessary.

      Kind of ironic that the demon she used to hunt down was now the one she was hiding 
from...

      It was when she was in a bustling town that she met up with an old acquaintance.

      &quot;...Tsuru...? Are you Tsuru?&quot; The ebony haired girl turned at the sound of a man&#39;s 
voice. She had been preparing to leave the inn she was staying at before he interrupted her. 
She recognized him immediately.

      &quot;Ark? Ark - what are you doing here? The settlement is... it&#39;s miles away from her!&quot; 
She said, giving the young man a hug. He seemed rather distraught.

      &quot;Yes, yes, I know. Bakra and I left the settlement to go establish a new one nearby, 
but... you see, there&#39;s been an incident and I really really need your help!&quot; Ark said, 
desperately. Tsuru walked out of the inn with him.

      &quot;Alright, what&#39;s wrong? I&#39;ll gladly help you out.&quot;

      &quot;You see, Mara, Mara&#39;s about ten years old now and a few hours ago she went off into a 
field to go pick some flowers, or something, I really don&#39;t know, but,&quot; The young man took a 
deep breath. &quot;We didn&#39;t realize that a vampire lived nearby and she kidnapped Mara. Bakra 
went after her immediately and he&#39;s a very strong demon, but a demon nonetheless.&quot;

      Tsuru nodded. &quot;I understand. You want me to go help him exorcise this vampire? No 
problem - you go back home to the settlement and I promise we&#39;ll bring back Mara unharmed.&quot;
