<a href="../original/angelgift-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        &quot;X&#39;orn is a killer,&quot; Amara explained to them all softly, &quot;one 
of the worst. He collects bounties by bringing the heads back, usually 
not connected to the bodies.&quot;

        &quot;Lovely,&quot; Sharin groaned.

        Both Sharin and Milly were quite pointedly keeping themselves 
directly between Amara and where Princess Jenna was standing by 
Allison, and the bounty hunter had to fight back a smile. The two 
worked quite well together, reading each other&#39;s cues and reacting 
almost instantly. And despite the snipping at each other, they seemed 
to be good friends. &#39;I wonder how long it&#39;ll take them to figure that 
out?&#39; Amara mused.

        Roma looked off in the distance, the android rapidly accessing 
the relevant Galactic Patrol files. &quot;X&#39;orn has quite the record,&quot; she 
noted, &quot;but no charges were pursued against him.&quot;

        &quot;So what do we do about him?&quot; Milly asked pointedly.

        &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything,&quot; Amara said to them quite 
seriously, &quot;I&#39;ll deal with him.&quot; She smiled, &quot;I owe Allison.&quot;

        &quot;No way,&quot; Allison spoke up forcefully from the back. &quot;If he&#39;s 
really that dangerous, he could..&quot; she trailed off.

        Amara smiled at Allison slightly, her own dark hair falling 
into her eyes as she said, &quot;You haven&#39;t changed, have you?&quot;

        &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; Allison admitted.

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Amara chuckled softly. She turned around and 
strode towards the front door. &quot;I&#39;ll let you all know when I have 
news,&quot; she called back to them over her shoulder as she unlocked the 
door and then headed outside.

        There was a long moment of silence once she left before Jenna 
softly asked Allison, &quot;What did she mean, you haven&#39;t changed?&quot;

        &quot;Shouldn&#39;t we be more worried about X&#39;orn?&quot; Allison blinked. 
Kat and the others all looked at her expectantly, and she sighed 
softly. &quot;All right, All right, I&#39;ll tell. I guess she was talking 
about when we first met...

        Allison had noticed the dark haired new transfer student that 
morning, but other than that hadn&#39;t paid too much attention to her. It 
wasn&#39;t until she saw the gang of older boys picking on her that she 
had to act. Charging into the fight she had backed up the dark haired 
girl, and despite taking some punches themselves, they won.

        &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; Amara had asked softly, &quot;They&#39;ll go 
after you for helping me.&quot;

        &quot;I couldn&#39;t not help,&quot; was the best answer Allison could come 
up with. She noticed a badly crumpled bag on the ground, ruined items 
of food spilling out, &quot;They wrecked your lunch? Come on, you can share 
mine.&quot;

        &quot;Huh?&quot; Amara blinked, following after the brown haired girl in 
surprise.

        A sandwich, fruit, and a thermos of juice were swiftly shared 
between the two young girls Amara occasionally trying to refuse and 
Allison insisting. A pair of snack cakes were pulled open, and Allison 
held out a golden cake to her.

        &quot;What is it?&quot; Amara had asked.

        &quot;Twinkie,&quot; Allison smiled, &quot;they&#39;re good.&quot;

        Amara had taken a bite tentatively, then her somber face had 
lit up with a gentle smile. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;I won&#39;t 
forget this.&quot;

        Allison blinked innocently, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

        &quot;... anyway,&quot; Allison finished her tale, &quot;we stayed friends 
throughout elementary school, but we sort of lost touch after that.&quot;

        Kat, Jenna and Marilyn were all sniffling slightly, wiping at 
tears in their eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so deeply moved,&quot; Marilyn wailed, and began 
to cry.

        Even Sharin had a slight smile on her face. &quot;It seems Jenna 
picked well when she decided on you,&quot; she looked at Allison 
thoughtfully. With that, Sharin gave them a casual wave of her hand 
and left the book shop herself.

        Out in another part of the city, Amara strode down the street 
confidently, her eyes scanning all around her. &#39;Not the best part of 
town,&#39; she thought, &#39;but it&#39;s just the sort of place that X&#39;orn would 
find most comfortable.&#39;

        The boarding houses in the slums were dark and the air smelled 
of the very worst of human appetites, but she bore it calmly as she 
pursued her quarry. With the sort of relentlessness that had helped 
build her tough reputation in the bounty hunting community she kept on 
working, finding leads and then following then up.

        X&#39;orn wasn&#39;t the quietest of men, nor the most subtle. It 
wasn&#39;t that long before Amara found the building he was using as a 
base, warning the manager off with a single glance. She checked over 
her gun cautiously, then made her way upstairs.

        Amara&#39;s eyes narrowed as she stepped out onto the top floor, 
hearing the sounds of a beating going on. &#39;X&#39;orn, probably,&#39; she 
thought bleakly. She ran almost silently down the hall, kicked out 
powerfully, and nearly sent the door off it&#39;s hinges.

        &quot;Move and die,&quot; Amara growled even as she took in the 
situation. The bloody faced girl scampered away from the redhead, 
bolting outside. The man gave her a mild look, wiping at blood stained 
hands calmly.

        &quot;Amara,&quot; X&#39;orn smiled at her slightly, &quot;it&#39;s been a long time. 
Are you trying to save the bounty for yourself?&quot;

        &quot;Something like that,&quot; Amara answered him coolly, he didn&#39;t 
need to know the real reason why she was doing this.

        &quot;Too bad,&quot; X&#39;orn said as he ducked out the upper story window.

        With a muffled curse Amara remembered the fire escape running 
up the side of the building and moved to chase after him. The bolted 
up the metal steps together, X&#39;orn occasionally turning back to fire 
down at her, Amara saving her own shots for later. She reached the 
roof, and was nearly grazed from a wild shot from X&#39;orn.

        &#39;That&#39;s about enough,&#39; Amara thought to herself bleakly, 
bringing her own gun up smoothly and firing, sending X&#39;orn scurrying 
for cover. Taking the opportuninty she got the rest of the way onto 
the roof, then stood there out in the open.

        &quot;Are you mad,&quot; X&#39;orn peeked out from behind a cooling station 
to yell, &quot;I could shoot you down right now.&quot;

        &quot;Are you that much of a coward, X&#39;orn?&quot; Amara asked him 
pointedly.

        With a snarl X&#39;orn errupted from his cover, &quot;You&#39;ve been on 
this dirtball world far too long.&quot;

        &#39;I alwaysd did like cowboy movies,&#39; Amara mused, watching 
X&#39;orn intently, just waiting for him to take his shot.

        The two of them moved together, their guns fired almost at the 
same time, twin weapons discharging loudly into the near silence. 
Amara felt herself being hammered backwards, a sudden flare of pain 
exploding in her upper body.

        X&#39;orn stood there for a moment stunned, his gun raised and an 
oddly blank expression on his cruel face. From his forehead a small 
trickle of blood suddenly appeared, and he slid bonelessly to the 
ground, stone dead.

        &quot;Wonder if there&#39;s any outstanding bounties on him,&quot; Amara 
said as she reached up to her bloody shoulder, hissing softly as she 
felt where X&#39;orn&#39;s bullet had torn into the flesh. &quot;At least that way 
I might make some money off this,&quot; she added.

        There was a sound from over on the fire escape, and Amara 
painfully brought her gun back up before blinking in honest surprise 
at seeing one of Allison&#39;s friends standing there. &#39;Sharin,&#39; Amara 
recognized her, but kept her gun on her anyway.

        &quot;You mind pointing that somewhere else?&quot; Sharin asked.

        &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Amara asked suspiciously.

        &quot;I followed you,&quot; Sharin admitted, &quot;just in case you needed 
help.&quot;

        &quot;Why?&quot; Amara asked.

        Suddenly testy Sharin said, &quot;Because Allison would have a fit 
if something happened to you, dummy!&quot; Quietly, &quot;She&#39;s going to be 
upset enough you got shot.&quot;

        Amara let her gun fall even as she said wryly, &quot;You&#39;ve got a 
point.&quot;

        The two made their way back downstairs and stepped out ofd 
X&#39;orn&#39;s room into the hallway to see Milly standing there, holding a 
medical kit and looking rather peeved. &quot;Let me take a look at that.&quot; 
she grumbled to Amara.

        &quot;How did you know...&quot; Sharin blinked.

        &quot;Obviously you were going out to go follow Amara,&quot; Milly 
shrugged as she put a pressure bandage on the wound, &quot;and neither one 
of you has any sense. So I thought that I&#39;d better be here to keep an 
eye on the both of you.&quot;

        &quot;Are you sure you aren&#39;t partners?&quot; Amara asked.

        Both women looked at her, &quot;NO WAY.&quot;

        Amara shrugged somewhat painfully, &quot;Fair enough.&quot;
