<h1>Daughters of Artemis (part 4 of 19)</h1>

<a href="../original/artemis-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;The children of England would never be slaves,&quot; the
tall, intense blonde woman using the karaoke system
sang out, &quot;they&#39;re trapped on the wire and dying in
waves! The flower of England face down in the mud and
stained in the blood of a whole generation....&quot;

&quot;Now that&#39;s cheerful,&quot; Circe noted, the gorgeous
blonde pulling some beer from the tap and passing it
to a customer.

&quot;I&#39;m a bit surprised to see her here, honestly,&quot;
Diana&#39;s eyes were narrowed, the tawny haired woman
looking just a bit nervous.

&quot;You know her?&quot; Circe raised a eyebrow as she walked
to her lover&#39;s side, her blue dress hugging her body
like it was painted on.

Diana smiled slightly as she looked at Circe, &quot;I&#39;m
surprised you didn&#39;t notice it, actually.&quot; She looked
back to the stage as the woman continued to sing,
&quot;She&#39;s a relative, her name&#39;s Athena.&quot;

Circe blinked at her lover, barely noticing the
leather dress she was wearing today. &quot;A goddess?&quot; she
murmured. Looking back at the blonde as she added, &quot;I
hope she isn&#39;t as much trouble as your last two
relatives.&quot;

&quot;What, Herma and Baccus?&quot; Diana grinned at the memory.
&quot;I seem to remember how popular Herma was with the
crowds,&quot; she added cheerfully, getting some fresh nuts
and pouring them into the bowls along the bar.

&quot;Not everyone was too happy to learn that &#39;Herma&#39; is
short for hermaphrodite,&quot; Circe pointed out to her
lover dryly.

Diana snorted her amusement as she remarked, &quot;No,
they&#39;re just a bit uncomfortable knowing that they can
be attracted to someone of both genders.&quot; She gave
Circe a grin, &quot;Besides, Athena tends to stay out of
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; Circe muttered.

The crowd was a good mix tonight, young men and women
sitting at the tables and dancing madly out on the
dance floor. They had wanted to keep the place a
purely woman&#39;s bar but the lack of business had made
them realize they were going to have to do nights like
this just to stay open. It made things a bit more...
dangerous in the club, but they could handle it.

Then again, there were other problems to deal with.
The brown haired woman dressed as a priest drank
steadily, not seeming to care about what was going on
around her, just trying to get drunk. Several men and
more than a few woman had approached her curiously but
she sent them, away with cold words and a deadly gaze.

Diana moved to her end of the bar, wiping the top off
with a cloth. &quot;Anything I can do for you, Sam?&quot; she
asked.

Samantha Teresa looked up, her eyes narrowing
slightly. She puffed out a breath, making herself
relax as she commented, &quot;I&#39;m still surprised you let
me come back here, considering the trouble I caused
the first time I was here.&quot;

Diana smiled slightly, &quot;Jess spoke up for you, that
helped.&quot;

&quot;Jess Drake?&quot; Sam looked at her in honest surprise.
She shook her head slightly as she muttered, &quot;I&#39;m
surprised.&quot;

&quot;I get the sense that she respects you, even if you
don&#39;t get along,&quot; Diana shrugged. She gave Sam a look,
&quot;So why are you trying so hard to get drunk?&quot;

Sam picked up her glass, gazing thoughtfully at the
beer within. &quot;It&#39;s Veteran&#39;s Day,&quot; she said, &quot;and part
of me wants to be with my former unit, honoring our
dead.&quot;

&quot;Gulf War?&quot; Diana asked.

&quot;Vietnam,&quot; Sam flashed a smile, &quot;thanks.&quot;

&quot;But your vows as a Knight Templar say that you have
to leave your past connections behind, if I recall
correctly,&quot; Diana noted as she took the glass and
refilled it, passing it back to Sam casually. &quot;Getting
drunk in memory?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Does everyone know that I&#39;m a Templar? Was there a
notice put out about it?&quot; Sam bitterly complained.

&quot;There are certain signs I noticed,&quot; Circe said to her
dryly, &quot;like the bulge of pistols hidden beneath your
priest&#39;s garb, Sam.&quot;

&quot;Point,&quot; Sam made a face. &quot;We used to go out drinking
together,&quot; she sighed, &quot;in between all of the chaos
and patrols.&quot; She finished her next glass of beer then
pushed away from the bar, puffing out a breath. &quot;Guess
I&#39;m done,&quot; she steadied herself before adding, &quot;see
you later.&quot;

Circe looked up from where she was wiping out a beer
glass to see the intense blonde easily cutting through
the crowd towards them. Athena stepped up to the bar
and met her eyes calmly as she asked, &quot;Do you have any
Ozuo?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Circe calmly answered as she took out a
bottle of the thick, oily alcohol and poured her a
shot glass of it.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Athena drank the strong booze like it was
water, only shuddering slightly once she was done.
&quot;Nice,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;I guess you&#39;re here to see Diana?&quot; Circe asked her
boldly, looking the other woman over thoughtfully. She
could have passed for a teenager, her body fit and
face unlined, at least until you looked into her old,
old eyes.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Athena agreed. She smiled slightly, &quot;Don&#39;t
worry, I&#39;m willing to honor this place&#39;s status as
neutral territory.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to be blunt,&quot; Circe flashed her a bit
warmer smile as she poured the woman another drink,
&quot;Diana has told me bits and pieces about some of your
family&#39;s spats, but she didn&#39;t tell me all about who
sided with who.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re concern for her does you credit,&quot; Athena
murmured.

Circe looked up, seeing her lover walking towards them
and nodded slightly. &quot;I think I&#39;ll leave you two
alone,&quot; she said, moving away even as Diana arrived.

Diana settled into the seat beside Athena, the two
women bearing an eerie resemblance to each other as
they looked at each other with years of wariness.
&quot;It&#39;s been a long time, sister,&quot; Diana finally said to
her softly.

Athena took another drink, setting the little glass
down on top of the bar with a soft tap. &quot;Well over a
hundred years,&quot; she answered her, &quot;not since before
the Olympian exile.&quot; She looked off into the distance
a moment before softly asking, &quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll have to be more specific than that,&quot; Diana
answered.

Athena&#39;s eyes flashed with anger as she barked, &quot;Don&#39;t
play games with me!&quot; She noticed the eyes of other
patrons turning to them and dropped her voice as she
continued, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you join us in our efforts to
overthrow Zeus?&quot;

Diana sighed, reaching over the top of the bar and
awkwardly pulling herself a beer. &quot;For someone as
smart as you&#39;re supposed to be, you can be so stupid,&quot;
she muttered.

&quot;What?&quot; Athena looked offended.

&quot;Challenging the Throne was supremely stupid,&quot; Diana
said bluntly, &quot;no matter the crimes that m&#39;lord may
have committed against us.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe you said that,&quot; Athena looked over at
her in surprise, &quot;you remember what happened to
Apollo!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t talk to me about my brother,&quot; Diana said
harshly, &quot;I was there.&quot;

Athena winced, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Diana drank some of her beer, &quot;Zeus is mad, even his
wife would admit it, but that doesn&#39;t lessen his power
any.&quot; She puffed out a sigh as she continued, &quot;In some
ways he&#39;s even stronger, no longer bound by any
self-imposed restraint.&quot;

&quot;His power is in decline,&quot; Athena protested.

&quot;Have you looked in a mirror lately?&quot; Diana asked her
wryly. &quot;All of we gods are shadows of what we were,
while Zeus waxes stronger by consuming the unwary
godlings that he finds.&quot; She paused sadly, &quot;Like my
brother, Apollo.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re just going to wait until He decides to pick
you off?&quot; Athena asked coldly.

&quot;This place is a sanctuary,&quot; Diana answered her
coolly, &quot;I and others have erected defenses even Zeus
must be wary off.&quot; Her eyes were hard and cold as she
continued, &quot;And no, I&#39;m not just waiting until He
comes for me.&quot;

&quot;You do have a plan,&quot; Athena murmured, her eyes
lighting up in hope.

&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; Diana agreed, &quot;and having the assistance of
the Goddess of wisdom and war would be most helpful.
Would you be willing to stick around here for awhile?&quot;

&quot;You have to ask?&quot; Athena smiled. She looked around
thoughtfully, &quot;But I&#39;m not waiting tables, I&#39;ll pay my
way some other way.&quot;

Diana actually laughed softly, &quot;Somehow I can&#39;t
envision you waiting tables, sister. Your dignity
wouldn&#39;t allow it.&quot;

To be continued....

Authors Note: Samantha Teresa has appeared in Blood,
Sex and Magic and then turned up in Descent, aiding
the human souled demoness in her small-scale war with
the crime lord Lady Diana. I&#39;ve been meaning to get
into her background a bit so I thought this might be
an good time to try.... The song that Athena signs
from is &#39;Children&#39;s Crusade&#39; by Sting, from one of his
older albums.</pre>
