<p>“Hearts and Stars: a moment of tranquility”</p>
<p>We’ve been here  for two days now. It’s hopeless. Don’t get me wrong—I fully  believe that we’ll find our friends again, or at least be  rescued—it’s just that while we’re waiting for that to happen,  things seem hopeless. There’s very little food or water—we’ve  had to wander great distances to find any—and let’s face it, we  couldn’t build a decent shelter even if we had a million years. I  wouldn’t actually complain about that last one, but it rained  yesterday, and not just a soft sprinkle or a gentle drip here and  there, but a full blast of pouring, sopping, drenching, fat curtains  of water, splashing and drowning us, with the wind lashing it  everywhere, making our crude attempts to cover ourselves useless. It  went on and on into the night, and we fought with the elements, and  each other, just to build something that could keep us dry for a few  hours.</p>
<p>Sleep was awful: we had wet clothes, no blankets or fire, and the ground was soggy and  muddy (at least we didn’t have to worry about predators. No <em>sane</em> person would be out in this). The shelter wasn’t exactly stable,  either, and I remember being forced awake by the incessant rain, or  my agitated companions, so we could fix it and hope it stayed up this  time. I think Herut and Eve were ready to quit after the fifth  attempt (I gave up after the second), and we just made do with what  we had until the storm passed. I didn’t sleep at all that night; I  think I just laid on the ground, wincing as a few stray drops  punctured my face, weary beyond belief—or relief. The weather  improved once morning came, but we were soaked all the way down to  our bones, and our shoddy camp was a wreck. At least we didn’t  have to worry about water for awhile.</p>
<p>I wasn’t that  bothered by nature’s foul mood, to be honest. As long as it wasn’t  freezing or burning, I could live through it so long as my other  three “castaways” were there with me. The thing that bothered me  the most was that I had lost my canvas and my artwork tools during  the confusion that sent us hurling to this godforsaken rock, and I <em>really</em> wanted to pain this world; my brother Allen would’ve loved it. Even  while it was pouring down rain, this planet had a special beauty  to it that I wanted to capture: the endless grasslands, green and  gold like the fur of a benevolent animal, vast forests in one  direction and open wilderness in another, mountains that sang to us  in the morning and hummed quietly at night, animals of all kinds who  visited us (a couple of rabbits actually approached us, and we got to  feed them!), and of course, the mesmerizing sunrises and sunsets, and  the brilliant splash of stars spread across the dark sky—oh, there  were so many of them! Even when I had been in my room aboard the <em>Dauntless</em>,  I had never seen the night sky in such glory or splendor. It was  torture to sit there without my equipment; I didn’t even trust my  prodigious memory to keep such treasures.</p>
<p>But  I found ways. There was nothing on that world even remotely close to  paper, so I  used the light side of a few leaves as my canvas, or sometimes I’d  choose a smooth, flat stone to paint on, or I’d douse the vast  countryside in pigments—and once, Mink even volunteered to be a  living easel, and I colored her wildly with the life of our strange  new home. I had plenty of resources when it came to choosing colors:  ash and soot from the fire, burnt sticks, ground-up rocks (Eve  crushed them with her mechanical feet), sap, chlorophyll, berries,  fungi, various fruits and flowers we found, even our own blood (we  certainly had our fair share of scrapes. I’m sure Fuuka would’ve  been infuriated at what we were doing, but this was ART!). Whenever  I wasn’t busy trying to figure out how to build a new shelter, or  plant and harvest food properly (I was elected “group leader”), I  kept myself occupied with my life’s purpose.</p>
<p>I did more than  paint and sketch; I thought about my relationship with my fellow  crewmates, specifically Herut and Mink. Obviously there are many  more besides those two, </p>
<p>but…I feel a  strong kinship towards them. Herut is a short, simple, single-minded  girl around my own age, incredibly mature and intelligent, perhaps a  little cold at times, but willing to explore what the outside worlds  have to offer. Society has seen her as nothing more than a repair  and maintenance unit for all her life—closer to a mechanized  toolbox than a real person—and while it might be arrogant of me to  say that I know her better than that, I feel that we can understand  each other very well, and have grown close thanks to our unusual  compatibility. I’ve always hated being so small; people still  mistake me as a twelve year-old, even though I’m nineteen years old  (and will turn twenty in a few months), and they’re surprised when  I start talking like an Ares Academy graduate—but Herut is almost  the same size as me, and she’s one of the most brilliant and…I  will go ahead and say it…one of the warmest people I’ve known. I  had hoped the two of us could be friends the moment I first saw her,  but now that we’ve reached that stage…</p>
<p>I’ve never kissed  anyone like that before. It was inexperienced and clumsy, but very  special and sweet, sort of like the last hours of school before  summer vacation starts. She told me she had been merely curious, but  I was willing to go along with her, because in all honesty, I truly  cared for Herut and wanted to find out if it was in…that way. I  don’t think it’s fair to reach a conclusion just yet—we haven’t  had any time to ourselves since we finished that race—but I would  like to see where this path takes us, whether or not I’m really in  love with my best friend or merely just overly fond of her. Regardless, I want to paint her image across the grass, so that all  the world will know of my inspiration.</p>
<p>I have these doubts  because there’s Mink, too. It’s strange to think that we might  have a connection because she doesn’t look down on me like a kid--I  mean, she looks <em>down</em> on me, but she can’t help being that tall!--or that there might be  something between us simply because she stares longingly at all my  artwork. I learned a little bit about the Yun race since our sojourn  began, and while they’re not very emotional people, they do love to  sit and bask in whatever radiant beauty is surrounding them. I can’t  tell for certain if the Yun see people like that as well, but they  are certainly the most relaxed and “at home” in a quiet, somewhat  secluded area, suffused only with the sound of the natural world,  devoted to their thoughts and what may come their way during this  meditation. The Yun are not creative people (their aversion to  complex devices or even works of art borders on the religious),  because they believe an unnatural reproduction of anything will kill  the parent--but Mink seems to like my art, and the artist as well.</p>
<p>Is it wicked of me  to feel the spark of passion for two people? To be understood on an  intellectual level on one side, and an artistic level on another…it’s  possibly the only real example of “duality” I’ve ever seen. This pleasant, wonderful, yet distressing sensation of ambivalence  has made my recent days more complicated than I’m accustomed to. I  can’t confide with one for fear of hurting the other, and as  unbiased as Eve is, she’s made it very clear that she is not an  authority on these matters. I will have to reach a conclusion, or at  least a compromise, by myself.</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>My friends said  that making the shelter was the hardest part of surviving out here,  but I’d have to disagree. I am used to this sort of thing, after  all, since Master Vimmy asks me to </p>
<p>perform much more  menial tasks. Since I know very little about actually constructing a  shelter, I had to rely on Shana’s ideas, which always seemed to be  improving no matter how many mistakes we make. She’s such a  patient, sweet young woman. She’s very special to me. I like her. It was a little difficult for Eve and Herut to understand the  concept, since their minds were usually on machines--but I since  learned, after sharing an inhospitable night with them, that they are  made of much other components.</p>
<p>Since  it was such a  merciless downpour, we decided to take our clothes off and let them  dry in the sun. There was no such thing as civilization on this  world, and with our friends scattered (possibly), we have all the  privacy we could want. I’m not particularly bashful about  revealing my body in front of others, and neither was Herut: it was  as elementary an action as tightening a bolt or removing a spark plug  (yes, I am getting the hang of her terminology! Slowly but surely!).  Shana was a little shier, but her face lit up and her eyes began to  sparkle as she undressed. This was something fun, forbidden, and  even feral for her. We were removing ourselves from the civilized  women we were before landing on this world, and turning into gay  maenads, free from restraint and judgment, our beauty as deep and  inalienable as the earth, our voices songs, our souls bared. I sat  on a small carpet of moss, drawing my knees up, as I watched Shana  and Herut playing, a tranquil smile on my face. They were such  beautiful people; I felt strong love for them both.</p>
<p>Shana I knew and  loved well enough thanks to her portrayal of worlds and beings, and  for once, I knew no sin as I looked upon art. Her mere presence  pleased me, and I always wondered what treasure she would unveil for  me next. Herut, I admit, was not as close to my heart as Shana,  probably because, when you get right down to it, the two of us are so  alike, and it is my experience that living beings are rarely  attracted to those who share too many qualities they possess. We  were all engineered to find attraction in the unusual, the different,  the alien; we are not all clones, and thankfully, we are not forced  to live on a world where there is more than one “me”. I wanted  to love Herut, but we were both so young, just recently breaking free  from that which is familiar, blinking as we step into the light of  the outside, wondering what lies in store for us, cautious and yet  eager for the journey.</p>
<p>Eve is another  matter entirely. She is not young like the rest of us; she has seen  many worlds, and knows great pain, and is harder and wiser for her  experiences. Her eyes remind me of a dying fire, smothered by its  own ashes, still holding a few stubborn embers in its weary arms. Of  the few moments that Eve and I shared in privacy (prior to this one,  I mean), I was given fleeting glimpses of her heart, and though I  wouldn’t dare to say I understood even these slivers, I can  certainly observe their harsh beauty and gently coax it out into a  bloom. I’ve heard her say her childhood was dark and troublesome;  she became a rebel and was expelled from her family, disgusted by  paternal ideology. I admire her drive to strike out on a new path,  rather than follow the family cycle, and through her cynicism and  misanthropy, I know there is a strong yearning to be a part of the  Living Fabric; she just needs to keep searching for the common  thread.</p>
<p>Eve and I actually  spoke fairly often as we laid basking in the sun. I silently studied  her artificial legs, and was given permission to touch them, and ask  how they came into being. Eve described her “fall from grace”  (as she worded it), and made mention of a mechanized “friend” of  hers she had left behind. I pressed the issue, wondering what her  life had been like before turning sour, but she did not answer  me--she just sighed, leaned back, and stared into the sky. Her  expression said enough: she had been heartbroken to leave, and she  yearned more than anything to return one day. I scooted over and  took her hand, smiling softly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“That’s what  the <em>Dauntless</em> is for,” I said. She nodded her head, grinned sadly, and laid down  on the grass, naked and strikingly beautiful, an image of  vulnerability and innocence I could not help but love. Yes, Eve, I  loved you too--and yes, Shana, to answer your question, I <em>can</em> see people the same way I see the world. But it’s different. Worlds  are, for the most part, in a constant state, and do not change  for the most part, except through calamity or revolution. But people  are as shifty as the wind, gentle and sweet one moment and fierce in  the next. Their souls vibrate in different colors; they are an  anomaly, albeit a <em>welcome</em> anomaly, and I can judge them by the beauty they radiate. I think  Dr. Miracle has this same power; we can see things for what they <em>can</em> be, not just what they are.</p>
<p>But I digress. By  the time we made a suitable shelter (it was easier to do without the  rain, and more fun in the nude), our clothes were dry and we could  return to our old lives. But something had changed during those  hours of rest, something that irrevocably transformed us from  “something” into “something else”. That is how I interpreted  it, anyway, for I honestly fell in love during the time we spent  together--but with <em>who</em>,  ah, is a secret I shan’t tell, not even to Master Vimmy. I do hope  that hyperactive little troll is okay. Lately, I’ve been thinking  about retiring from my service and striking out on my own, if this  voyage of ours ever comes to an end…</p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>What a pain that  shelter was! And sleeping outside in the rain? Ugh! No thanks! Never again! The damned thing fell over so many times that it  would’ve been better if we had hidden under a tree! And of course,  we only got it to stay up when we didn’t NEED it! Whew…I  certainly have a lot to complain about, not that anybody could blame  me. If you were thrown out of your bed in the middle of the night by  a crazed genie, slammed into a remote world without so much as a  flicker of technology to it--or even intelligent life--and forced to  survive on “wits and will” alone, you’d be pretty crank as  well. But let’s not forget the most pressing issue here: I would  gladly suffer through all this and more if it helped unravel the  mystery surrounding this “Origin” entity.</p>
<p>I know that Shana  and I tried cracking this case earlier, but it didn’t really lead  anywhere. I had asked Dr. Miracle if her friend Kyle really had a  foolproof way of getting people to tell the truth, and she confirmed  it quite adamantly. Whatever that deranged Pyrosian said, or meant,  it was certainly the truth, but what could it mean? “Origin” had  always meant “the beginning” to me, or something to that effect. Perhaps it was just another big-shot who liked giving himself a  cool-sounding name, like Apex or Mastermind, or (corniest of them  all) Harbinger of Doom. But just because Shana and I are also very  scientific, we asked around the ship and did some research, or at  least as much as we could before this whole mess started. For all  our efforts, we didn’t discover anything new. I tried bringing it  up again, but by that time, I was told to remove my clothes and bask  in the sun. Fine, fine…</p>
<p>I’ve never been  nude just for the sake of being. Come to think of it, the only time  I really take all my clothes off is when I shower. I usually sleep  in whatever I have on at the time, and I’ve never needed to go  swimming before. Chandra prances around the ship naked all the time,  and I despise this shameless display, so I wanted to keep myself  removed from this as much as possible. But recently I’ve learned  that there’s an innocent and even playful side to nudity--a </p>
<p>very invigorating,  sensual, liberating sense of unity you get. Now I’m not condoning  its use every day; in fact, the less it’s done, the better the  sensation is. Shana encouraged me to go play with her, and I found  myself going along, bare feet trampling over the grass, my naked,  childish chest heaving as we sprinted (unlike her, I don’t mind my  size, as it’s led me through several tight passages), my mechanical  attention to duty competing against my childish impulse towards  play--</p>
<p>And both coming  against a very unexpected sexual side.</p>
<p>As we held hands  and ran, waiting for our clothes to dry, I did come to realize that  Herut the maintenance and repair unit has a sexual side. For awhile  now, I wondered if I was even completely <em>human</em>,  but now I have my answer. I hate Chandra for her inability to  observe boundaries, but at least now I can forgive her for kidnapping  me and “ruining” my old life. I never would’ve understood my  humanity if she hadn’t pulled me away from that garage. I hate her  for being such a whore, but as my world unveils itself, little by  little, I can understand more of my own sensuality. I’m not merely  a “living toolbox”; I’m a young lady as well, complete with  hormones and emotions that are all my own; nobody could’ve  imprinted them on my psyche.</p>
<p>But I had to  control myself. Shana’s nudity was giving off its own illuminating  eroticism, and as enflamed as <em>I</em> was, she was only making things accelerate. I was given an epiphany,  a look into Chandra’s mind, and even though I promised myself that,  if I ever engaged in any sexual relation, it would only be with the  one I loved, I could understand a little bit of her desires; I could  see the world through her eyes. I did despise her--but not for the  sexuality; only its overabundance. Clumsy as my thoughts and  emotions were, I felt the need to make love to this nymph dancing  before me, a feeling that was as alien to me as the understanding of  an engine was as alien to Chandra. Shana saved me from this terrible  fate by dragging me back to the camp, where we all worked together to  complete the shelter, and put our clothes back on. Whew!</p>
<p>“So  about  Origin,” I muttered, attempting to focus on more important matters.  Shana smiled and even kissed my cheek, a sign of affection still new  to me, as new as sex itself, only sweeter and easier to understand.</p>
<p>“Are you always  thinking about silly things? Look, there’s not much we can do  about it right now, so why don’t we enjoy ourselves? It’s not  often we’re given so much time apart from the group. I’ve been  meaning to spend more time with you and Mink anyway, so why not make  the best of it?” Eve snorted and put her hands atop her head.</p>
<p>“I would be  offended that you excluded me, but who’d want to be part of the  kid’s table, anyway?”</p>
<p>“We’re not  kids,” Shana snorted. Eve grinned and ruffled her hair.</p>
<p>“Well, you’re  both really short, and Mink’s about as childish as they come, so  I’m right.”</p>
<p>“Oh, please,” I  balked, “we’re <em>all</em> mature adults. Shana and I can’t help the way we look.”</p>
<p>“That’s right!”  she defended. “And if you’d just talk to Mink for five minutes…”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay,  sheesh! I was kidding anyway! You’re all fully-grown mature  women--happy?”</p>
<p>“Much,” Shana  beamed. Mink’s smile was considerably smaller, but it was pure and  wholesome; it brought out the light in all of us.</p>
<p align="center"></p>
<p align="center">……</p>
<p>I  didn’t know  what Herut was bitching about: this “disaster” has been one of  the best things that could’ve happened to me. I’ve been pulled  out of my dull, complacent, comfortable lifestyle, and thrown into a  world where I was forced to look at the broader perspective. There  were no machines, robots, or repairs here, just the rudimentary need  for survival, and the ironic desire to find our missing companions. All  my life, I’ve felt alone, lost and isolated, cut off from  humanity one piece at a time; my limbs and my eye are proof of this.  I’ve found more solace in machines than my fellow man, and I  believed, and even accepted, that I would be in this state all my  life.</p>
<p>Not that anybody  could blame me. Growing up with my isolationist senator of a father  and my frosty, distant stepmother, I’ve been saturated with the  idea that everything else is inferior, and has no place in proper  society. But I’ve also broken away from all that, rebelling so  perfectly that I was disowned and cut off from my old life—a small  step towards freedom and the recovery of my humanity. I made my way  over to Hallow’s Point and found the closest place to home I’ve  ever known. Carly and her family took me in without hesitation, and  as cantankerous as the old battle-axe was, I know she loved me; I’ll  always be grateful to her for that, and for teaching me how to  survive on my own.</p>
<p>Of course, now that  this was on my mind, I thought about what the Director said to me. I  don’t think she had any reason to lie, but she’s got to have her  facts wrong. Sure, Carly’s <em>like</em> a mother to me, but there’s not much resemblance, and I certainly  didn’t inherit her miraculous mechanical skills: I had to learn  them through years of hard work and disappointments. And wouldn’t  she have said <em>anything</em> if it were true? Astor must’ve meant somebody else. I don’t  have a family—not anymore. I guess it wouldn’t be right to say  I’m all by myself now, though: I’ve got all these crazy women  for company, and some, I’ll admit, are pretty great to be around. I’m not used to crowds or foreigners, but I am adjusting; I’ve  grown a lot since this voyage began. I’ve even fallen in love, I  think.</p>
<p>Ugh, I don’t want  to think about the Jackal. That’s a subject I’d rather not touch  upon! I mean, of course she’s beautiful, mysterious, and exciting,  but I feel like I just can’t trust her. She’s so secretive, and  she’s far too attracted to me. When I had sex with Chandra and  that prostitute, I knew what I was getting into, that they didn’t  really <em>love</em> me; they were just in it for the sex (and the money). Quincy  sprinkles devotion and sweet poetic nothings on me, and while I  always give in to my desires, it doesn’t feel like there can be  anything more. She’s not particularly evil, but she’s certainly  not a <em>good</em> person either. I need someone more stable, but when is that ever  going to happen? Oh well. Better focus on something else before I  get too bitter again.</p>
<p>Mink  will still  talk with me, though, even if I get nasty. I really appreciate that.  Maybe that’s my answer…but what kind of person makes an advance  when there are more important matters to overcome? (oh, I can think  of at least one) For now, I’ll just enjoy this little vacation,  because I’ve got a feeling that once we all get our asses in gear  and get off this dump, there won’t be any time to spare, no matter  how worthy the distraction.</p>
<p>We finished our  shelter in the nick of time: the clouds above us parted, the rain  scattering, and in its place came the sun, pregnant with heat. We  would have been roasted alive if we hadn’t scrambled underneath our  handmade canopy; we stayed there in relatively tight </p>
<p>quarters for a good  time, long enough to fear hunger and thirst. We had a fair supply  stocked away, but it wouldn’t be enough to last us the rest of the  day, so Shana and Mink volunteered to look for more. I personally  didn’t see anything amiss as they vanished in the distance, but I  could tell Herut was feeling a little jealous. She and Shana were  close, I noticed, and I also noticed how affectionate the little  wonder was with Mink. Since it wasn’t any of my business, I just  sat back and waited, content to bask in the heat like a lizard.</p>
<p>Speaking of  lizards, Herut spotted someone approaching us a few minutes after the  other girls left. I leaped up for joy, hoping it was one of our  friends come to rescue us. I couldn’t see them well in this bleary  heat, but I knew it was not a mirage, and I knew they were not one of  our companions: she was dressed completely different and didn’t  run after us like you’d expect. She approached us carefully,  completely covered with a white cloak, a straw hat shielding her  face. She paused a few steps away from our shelter, removing her  hat, staring at us intently. I balled my fists up defensively,  squinting through the merciless sunlight to see if I recognized her. She spoke before any names could come to mind.</p>
<p>“Been a long  time. Do you have any water?”</p>
<p>“What do you  mean, ‘been a long time’?” I asked. She grumbled and unwrapped  her cloak, revealing a svelte, flexible, feminine body, her skin as  gray as mink’s, her hair pale green like young grass, her eyes  covered by special goggles that filtered out the light. I recognized  that accessory at once and felt my heart jump. She had been one of  the crewmembers who left us after we acquired the Tome of Treasures. “Oh, I see. Changera, right?”</p>
<p>“I figured you’d  remember eventually. So do you have any water or not?”</p>
<p>“We do, but it’s  not much,” I answered. I gave Herut a look and reached for our  last canteen. Changer emptied it—there was barely a mouthful in  there—and sighed with relief.</p>
<p>“Thanks, I owe  you. The weather’s been unpredictable lately.”</p>
<p>“Tell us about  it,” I said, dropping my guard a little. I didn’t trust Changera  at all—I knew she was a Doppelganger, a shape-shifter, and could  deceive us if we weren’t careful—but she was vulnerable now, and  more importantly, she owed us for saving her life. “Some of the  others are out looking for water right now. They should be back  soon. Mind if I ask what you’re doing here?”</p>
<p>“Only if I can  ask you.”</p>
<p>“Fair enough,”  I shrugged. “But you first.”</p>
<p>“Very well,”  she smirked. “I was sent here on a mission. This planet has a  secret, and I’ve been hired to uncover it. The who and the why are  confidential.”</p>
<p>“At least you’ve  got a purpose,” Herut muttered jealously. “We were stranded  here. Rachel sort of went out of control and teleported us here.”</p>
<p>“Rachel?”  Changera whispered. “I don’t remember anybody named Rachel in  the crew. Nobody could teleport either, for that matter.” I  grimaced and glared at Herut, wondering how somebody so smart could  slip up like that. <em>You  idiot,</em> I wanted to scream, <em>she  doesn’t know about that, and there’s no need to tell her!</em> Herut seemed embarrassed that she had revealed such a key secret, so  when Changera pressed her, she feigned ignorance.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing,  really. Nothing that concerns your mission.”</p>
<p>“That’s Dr.  Miracle’s first name,” I said, improvising as best I could. “Rachel Miracle. We call…it…by its first name.”</p>
<p>“So Dr. Miracle  was a woman all along?” Changera murmured. I could tell she wasn’t  buying our story, but I had to keep going in case I was wrong.</p>
<p>“Dr. Miracle  is…feminine,” I managed. “It’s sort of like calling nature  itself a woman, </p>
<p>or time a man.”</p>
<p>“I see. I get it  now.” Changera smiled craftily and walked past us, affixing her  cloak and hat again. “Well, it’s been fun seeing you again, Miss  Kasberry, and thank you for the water. I’ve got a mission to  complete, so I’ll be off. Maybe we’ll run into each other again. Who knows, eh?” I got chills up my spine in spite of the  heat—Herut’s face had turned green with illness—and I stood in  a numb stupor until Mink and Shana came back with some relief. We  told them about what had transpired, but Shana tried assuring us that  we did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>“It’s not that  crucial a secret, right? Besides, from what I remember, Changera  seems like a trustworthy person. Let’s not worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Too  many  disasters have come from letting matters go,” Mink warned her. Shana  looked up at her, smiled sadly, and drew her into a comforting  embrace. Herut watched with envious stoicism, not that I could blame  her anymore. If only somebody held me like that.</p>
<p><em><u>Preview of  next chapter</u></em></p>
<p>Mink: How did all  this begin? What caused Rachel to lose control like that? What  happened to her? Will everybody be rescued, and will we be able to  leave this world?</p>
<p>Herut: The next  chapter will do its best to answer these questions as the final group  of castaways struggles to unearth the truth.</p>
<p>Shana: So can we  all have HLS once we’re finished with this introspective crap?</p>
<p>Mink: I wouldn’t  mind.</p>
<p>Herut: blush!  S-sex?</p>
<p>Shana: Heeheehee!</p>
<p>Eve: I’d settle  for some action! I’m bored sitting around on my butt!</p>
<p>Shana: Finally, the  conclusion to volume five has arrived! Everything will be decided in  the next chapter, “Master of the World: a colossal struggle to  earn our freedom!”</p>
<p>Eve: Hopefully with  character development out of the way, we can get back to good ol’  blood and guts fighting!</p>
<p>Mink: And HLS.</p>
<p>Herut: …</p>
<p>Eve: …</p>
<p>Shana: Wheee!!</p>
