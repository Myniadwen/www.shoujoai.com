<a href="../original/allgirls-ch85.html">Back to Part 85</a><pre>&quot;Saturday&#39;s Child Works Hard for a Living&quot;

Emotions blurred through Usha&#39;s head like a flurry of snowflakes. Little 
surprise too, considering the literal storm outside, frosty and bitter. 
Inside was warm and safe, but her mind, alas, was being quartered. First 
of all, she had to address her weariness. She had physically drained 
herself working so hard these past few weeks, and probably could not 
move much, except to breathe and yawn. Acting as junior class 
president&#151;now the title was fully hers due to Mira&#39;s sudden (but not 
quite unexpected) abdication&#151;was more of a strain than people thought, 
and whatever perks came with the job were rare. She wanted to nap, or to 
at least lay down and let her body rest, but this was impossible. It was 
so late, and she had so many things to do.

Sometimes she became so absorbed in her work that she missed dinner. 
Whenever she got a break, she found her supper cold, in the fridge if 
she was lucky and out rotting in the open air if she wasn&#39;t. It didn&#39;t 
matter&#151;hunger always prevailed. And hey, what else were microwaves for? 
Of course, mom argued with her about her duties, usually playing the 
card of neglect to get a start on her headstrong daughter. Dad 
personally liked Usha&#39;s motivation, and said that as long as she was 
healthy and academically sound, he was happy.

It really was unfortunate, the breakup, but Usha felt like she was doing 
the right thing. Even now, several days later, she felt like she had 
done the right thing, although guilt also came up to bite her in the 
back. She still had feelings for Blake and Mira&#151;some nights she even 
masturbated from the memory, something that would&#39;ve shocked her a year 
earlier&#151;but letting them go free was the right decision in the end. 
Ultimately her father would never get to meet them as her lovers, 
although Usha did have plans to bring them over as friends. Kula, on the 
other hand, was another story&#151;and that tale had way too much drama for 
miss Krishnan to contemplate now.

Even though it was a Saturday, Usha did not have the day off. First 
there was an emergency meeting of the GSA she had to attend, then she 
stayed behind at school to fulfill several promises she had made to the 
teachers there. She orchestrated several hours of tutoring to younger 
kids, and attended an anti-war rally on the steps of the state capitol 
building later that day. She capped everything off by going to the store 
to pick up groceries for her mother, who had driven to the airport to 
drop her husband off. By the time Usha had some free moments for 
herself, it was already dark outside and nearly time for bed.

Of course, there was no such thing as rest for the weary. Usha barely 
had time to let her bones settle before she got a call, but thankfully 
it was just Kula. She was wondering if Usha would like to come over and 
have a late supper, maybe hang out, play some games, that sort of thing. 
Krishnan&#39;s belly did a little flip as she thought about what else the 
two of them could do with their time. What sort of magic was Kula 
working on her to make her so anxious? It didn&#39;t matter; her enchantment 
was strong, and it led her to get up, scribble a note to her mother, and 
head out the door.

......

&quot;You work way too hard,&quot; Kula noted once she got Usha to spill her guts. 
She ordered the girl to turn around so she could give her a massage. 
&quot;See, that&#39;s what I didn&#39;t like about you when I first got here, or one 
of the things. Aside from you bein&#39; a total cunt, a goody-goody, and 
Mother Superior, you were also way too stiff. Ya just didn&#39;t know when 
to have fun, to laugh, to be silly. Come on, your shoulders are like 
wood here.&quot;

&quot;I have...so many obligations,&quot; Usha responded, but she didn&#39;t sound so 
sure. However Kula may have treated her in the past, she was being 
unusually gentle this time around. Had all of her anger been vented out? 
Had their first illicit session of passion (it was too hard to be 
lovemaking, too soft for fucking) uncorked a kinder, tamer Kula? She 
still spoke of not liking Usha, but the sharp look in her eye or the 
fire in her voice was not there. Her words were more laced with love 
now! Oh, and that touch! Usha melted instantly.

&quot;Umm...that feels good,&quot; she sighed as Kula&#39;s warm hands found her 
stress spots and kneaded them out. She could feel the tickle of the 
exotic girl&#39;s voice as it whispered into her ear.

&quot;I thought it might.&quot; Usha stiffened slightly as she felt Kula&#39;s lips 
touch the nape of her neck, but she easily succumbed and surrendered, 
letting the younger woman peck and kiss as she pleased, from nape to the 
lobe of her ear. She hissed seductively, &quot;I want you to take your 
clothes off...so I can touch your skin,&quot; and Usha&#39;s stomach flipped 
violently. She obediently submitted and let Kula have complete control; 
on occasion she blacked out, but to the best of her memory, she and her 
so-called enemy undressed, made love on her bed, and slept together in 
each other&#39;s arms.

Again.

......

And again. But once they were finished, they realized what they had 
done, who they were with, and most interestingly, what day it was. 
Sunday morning. One whole day before school started. Usha wanted to 
spend it with Kula. To Hell with her duties; they would just have to 
wait! The raging animal in her (meekly hiding until now) wanted to shirk 
her responsibilities and invest every moment with Kula, the girl that 
had made her feel so good, the honest friend that told her the truth, 
the woman she&#151;dare she entertain the thought? Oh, she dared. The woman 
she was falling in love with.

They took a shower together and had breakfast together, but the fantasy 
didn&#39;t last. Usha&#39;s mother called (Krishnan had at least brought her 
cell phone) and talked up a storm, berating her daughter for staying out 
all night. Usha mentioned the note. Her mother then mentioned that the 
note implicated a visit to a friend&#39;s house, not a sleepover. Usha 
wanted to argue more, let her animal out to defend her honor, but guilt 
came crashing in again and took over. She&#39;d check in with her mother, in 
person, and then she would be grounded for doing such a thing.

&quot;Damn,&quot; said Kula once she got the news. &quot;That sucks! So like, you gotta 
go now?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;

&quot;Damn!&quot; Kula looked wounded, and leaned in to hug Usha. &quot;Your mom&#39;s 
whack, you know. If I did that, my parents wouldn&#39;t care. I could stay 
out for weeks, just as long as I didn&#39;t get in no more trouble.&quot; She 
then added with a grin, &quot;Heh, maybe I shoulda stayed over at your 
place.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think my mother would allow us to, uh, do what we have just 
done,&quot; noted Usha.

&quot;Why, is she a homophobe?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s just...she doesn&#39;t know...about us. I mean, I told her I ended 
things with Blake and Mira, but...well... Ahem!&quot; (she coughed, clearing 
a blush) &quot;You have to admit, our...affair did come suddenly.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re not having an affair.&quot;

&quot;Not the type you&#39;re thinking of.&quot;

&quot;Oh, so now you assume I&#39;m stupid.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t say&#151;&quot; The worried look on her face died when Kula started 
laughing.

&quot;See what I mean? Come on, you know I&#39;m kiddin&#39;!&quot; And to prove it she 
kissed Usha, firmly and lovingly, sending electric punches to Krishnan&#39;s 
gut. Was she...lusting after this woman? And what about Kula? Had she 
really been in love with the person she supposedly hated? Their 
relationship was confusing enough as it was, and perhaps if it weren&#39;t 
for the amazing sex and the sheer bliss of each other&#39;s company, Usha 
might&#39;ve backed out and became secluded.

Unfortunately, Kula could not convince her to stay, not even for a 
&quot;quickie&quot;. Usha left the Nanahara home and drove back to her own, 
dreading her mother&#39;s punishment. Was this what she got for wanting to 
add some fun in her life? She would slap her mother hard with the 
hypocrisy card when she arrived&#151;after all, had not the woman asked Usha 
to slow down, not work so much, have some fun? Oh, there would 
definitely be something to fight about when the two Krishnan women met 
later that day!

......

It was not long after that when Usha and Kula decided to make themselves 
officially a couple. It made no sense parading around like that without 
acknowledging it. With this new title came changes: Kula started letting 
a few people know (trying not to brag about how often she &quot;scored with 
the Krishnan bitch&quot;) while Usha, aside from telling mom and pop, also 
had to let Blake and Mira in on the news. Somehow she felt she owed it 
to them. She hoped they would be able to work things out and stay 
friends, if nothing else. After all, they were mature young women, even 
Mira, and in the end they all had somebody to love. What did it matter 
if the lineup wasn&#39;t exactly the same?

Usha called them up and asked to meet them outside school before classes 
started that Monday. She was first glad to hear they were both doing all 
right, and were still engaged in romantic and sexual activities with 
each other in spite of the &quot;loss&quot;. Usha had mixed feelings when she 
actually met up with them, and wondered if they would treat her any 
different if they learned where her love was now going to.

&quot;Hi,&quot; she greeted timidly. The other two waved, swathed in wintry wear 
(Mira with a coat Blake and Usha had bought her for Christmas). &quot;Uh, 
listen. We talked about most things over the phone, but I sort of 
neglected to mention one small detail. I&#39;m, uh, seeing somebody else 
now, and uh...I just hope you two don&#39;t think I broke up with you so I 
could see her.&quot;

&quot;I might get that feeling anyway,&quot; Mira snorted. Blake gave her a 
sympathetic look.

&quot;Look, I understand why you did it, and hey, if you met someone else 
along the way, then good. We&#39;re still your friends at least.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you think that way,&quot; Usha said with a smile. Did she ever feel 
relief! Mira, unfortunately, did not seem to share Blake&#39;s viewpoint, 
and crossed her arms harshly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what all this &#145;we&#39; business is. Who is the whore, Yusha? 
Are you fucking her now?&quot;

&quot;Mira, please! She&#39;s your friend too!&quot;

&quot;And my girlfriend is not a whore,&quot; said Usha firmly. Her face turned 
red despite how proudly she stood up and announced, &quot;If you must know, 
I&#39;m...seeing Kula. She and I are a couple now. And yes we are also 
lovers, not that it&#39;s your business!!&quot;

Needless to say, Baum and van Dijk were a little taken back.

After all, it was Kula.

&quot;You bitch!!&quot; Mira lashed out and might&#39;ve tackled poor Usha if Blake 
hadn&#39;t snapped out and grabbed her. &quot;After all that mother-fucking girl 
did to you and now you&#39;re in love with her? What the hell is wrong with 
you? I can&#39;t believe it! She hit you and said bad things about you and 
everything! And we defended you at that Homecoming dance! We slaved for 
hours because we thought we had done the right thing! And now you go and 
do this to us? 
You...mother-fucking...dick-sucking...half-witted......DOPE!!!&quot; Mira had 
ran out of vile curses at the end and spat out the only thing she had 
left, then stormed off before Usha could say a word in her defense.

Blake just whistled and rubbed her forehead, weary from weathering such 
storms.

&quot;Whew...I didn&#39;t think she&#39;d take it that badly. I have to admit, I&#39;m 
just as shocked as she is.&quot;

&quot;Well you&#39;re not the one giving me what&#39;s for.&quot;

&quot;Because there&#39;s nothing to give!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;I mean...yeah I&#39;m 
surprised&#151;I mean, c&#39;mon, you and Kula? It&#39;s like some kind of weird 
story or something. But...uh...geez! This&#39;ll take some getting used to.&quot;

&quot;But aren&#39;t you mad?&quot;

&quot;Uh...I&#39;m more confused than mad,&quot; she admitted. &quot;You forget, I&#39;m 
supposed to be the peacekeeper between us all. Now Mira, of course she&#39;s 
pissed; she&#39;s always been of two minds about you. As for me, well, you 
know. What is...is what is, is what I say. And hey, if this is what you 
want, then Yahweh bless and all. Plus,&quot; she added wittily, &quot;if you can 
keep Kula from making a scene every five minutes and actually put her in 
the right direction, all the more power to you, I say!&quot; Usha smiled 
warmly, glad that at least one of her ex-girlfriends wasn&#39;t piping mad. 
She reached out to embrace Blake, sighing the weary song of one in 
emotional tailspin.

&quot;You&#39;re a wonderful friend,&quot; she crooned. &quot;I just wish that Mira&#151;&quot;

&quot;Aw, let the Dijk cool down,&quot; Blake said. &quot;She&#39;s just mad, that&#39;s all. 
She told me she thinks you dumped us cuz&#39; you were in love with somebody 
else. I can only console her so much, you know, before I start to get 
tired of her.&quot;

&quot;So you don&#39;t think that?&quot; Blake smiled merrily.

&quot;Nah! It was silly to think we could make a three-way relationship work. 
It&#39;s best if we go two-and-two anyway.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;re really not mad?&quot;

&quot;Do I look it?&quot; she said, smiling. &quot;I&#39;ve got a great girlfriend, and 
you...well, Kula has a great girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Kula is great too, Blake,&quot; whispered Usha, slightly hurt. &quot;She really 
is. Once you really get to know her, you&#39;ll like her, I promise. She&#39;s a 
very kind young woman.&quot;

&quot;I guess it takes all types,&quot; she muttered. The bell for first classes 
rang, and so the two dismissed themselves, each to their own paths. Usha 
felt relieved that Blake was okay with the new situation, but she wished 
Mira hadn&#39;t been so violent. Blake would have to confront her and do her 
best to pacify the hothead&#151;after all, Usha had enough problems to worry 
about.</pre>
