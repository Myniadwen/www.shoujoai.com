4:55 pm

 

The long, arduous dinner rush was no time to be stressed out over 
personal burdens. Amy Nguyen had a lot on her plate- figuratively, and 
soon, literally- and to be drenched in all that now, when her workload 
would be at its greatest, would be fatal. Prior to cleansing her mind 
with some tai chi and meditation, Amy had felt herself wobbling under 
the weight of everything: school, work, soccer, personal relationships, 
and particularly this whole bribery fiasco. Once upon a time, she 
believed that occupying herself with other interests, besides working 
and secluding herself in her apartment, would be beneficiary to her 
health and end up turning her into a better person, but all it seemed to 
do was make things worse. She&#39;d never quit school, or the team, or break 
off any of the teetering friendships she had made, not even if they all 
made her collapse, but something had to give. Her funds were dwindling, 
so it couldn&#39;t be her job- she couldn&#39;t even afford a vacation. Maybe 
she just needed to talk this over with Wang Taitai.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;m ready,&quot; she whispered to herself as she straightened her 
waitress&#39; tie. Her mind was arbitrarily clear, and all her concerns were 
put away to think about later. The Buddha&#39;s most basic teaching stated 
that in order to achieve happiness, she would have to surrender her 
desires; maybe that included her concerns as well. She put on her 
work-smile and strolled to the first table, wishing she could drop that 
blasted stutter of hers. How easily it reared its ugly head when she met 
strangers.

&quot;W-w-welcome to Chili&#39;s,&quot; she attempted, veneering her speech with a 
broader smile. &quot;M-my name&#39;s Amy and I&#39;ll b-b-be your server. How are we 
all d-doing tod-d-day?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; came the general response. Ugh, Amy hated that word. They may as 
well say &quot;nothing&quot;. But whatever. &quot;Can we just have some beers first to 
start us off? Miller Light will be fine.&quot;

&quot;Ok-kay, coming r-r-right up. D-do I have to card anyone f-f-f-first?&quot; 
The group laughed politely; they were all clearly middle-aged men. 
Normally she would never pander like this, but if it brought loads of 
tips- and it usually did...

She went to the bar and placed the order, pausing to glimpse at one of 
the televisions. Every channel was either news or sports, neither of 
which was of any interest to her. Still, she looked, if only to see, by 
some small chance, if there was anything there about the soccer bribery 
scandal. She visited three more tables before retrieving all the drinks: 
sodas, waters, the beer, a mixed platter- and with skillful balance that 
belied her shaky, lanky appearance, she delivered them in order, no 
problem. Two of the tables asked for appetizers, while another still 
wasn&#39;t ready to order. More customers came pouring in through the door, 
and Amy remembered to smile whenever their eyes met hers.

She was fully in &quot;automatic&quot; mode after an hour. She visited tables, 
talked, was flirted on (usually by older men), strolled around, balanced 
drinks, carried heavy platters of steaming-hot food, pocketed tips, and 
did everything she could to keep her earlier concerns at bay. It wasn&#39;t 
difficult at all: it&#39;s hard to think about much when you&#39;re fully 
concentrating on a task. But Amy got tired, too, and was looking forward 
to her first short break when a television screen caught her eye. She 
couldn&#39;t hear it, of course, due to the noise of people and music around 
her, but she could see just fine, and she could read the scrolling 
captions. The report made her freeze where she stood, drawing immediate 
attention and concern.

&quot;In local news,&quot; the captions read (next to an inflammatory picture of a 
checkered dollar sign hanging precariously over the words &quot;Local Sports 
Scandal&quot;), &quot;a sports team in a local university is being suspected of 
paying other teams to purposely lose games. After authorities conducted 
a brief investigation, with the cooperation of university Chairman 
Helmuth Fitzgerald, it has been suggested that the women&#39;s soccer team 
may have been involved in the alleged bribery. Although the 
institution&#39;s Dean was unavailable for comment, the Chairman stated 
that, quote, &#39;Carnegie itself has nothing to do with this, and the 
student body at large should not be held at fault&#39;. He then declared a 
suspension of all further games until further notice, and issues an 
investigation into selective student-athletes&#39; activities and 
backgrounds.&quot;

The report then described matters in other counties, but Amy had heard 
enough. A suspension of all games? An investigation into her activities- 
and background?! And it was all over the news now! Amy felt sick enough 
to vomit; it was at that inopportune moment when all of her concerns, 
worries, and outside thoughts came bursting out of their cage to assault 
her, much like the demons from Pandora&#39;s jar. It was little wonder she 
collapsed.

 

Take my love, take my land
Take me where I cannot stand
I don&#39;t care, I&#39;m still free
You can&#39;t take the sky from me
Take me out to the black
Tell them I ain&#39;t comin&#39; back
Burn the land and boil the sea
You can&#39;t take the sky from me
There&#39;s no place I can be
Since I found serenity
But you can&#39;t take the sky from me...

 

&quot;Fallen Angels, Part One&quot;

 

The first of the autumn rains had started earlier that month, but they 
didn&#39;t become serious until now. The sky was unpleasantly dark gray as 
far as the eye could see, and from it came a chill and a wind hitherto 
alien to the denizens of fair weather now scurrying for shelter. It was 
now madness to be out any longer than necessary; the drizzle had turned 
to showers, and then buckets; umbrellas soon lost their worth as the 
volume of water came down, saturating the earth. Even Fleur&#39;s faithful 
cavalcade was bewildered at this aerial ocean: they could not protect 
their alpha wolf very well as she made her way to the gymnasium.

&quot;What&#39;s up with the weather?&quot; one of them questioned. &quot;These are more 
like summer rains.&quot;

&quot;It always rains like this around autumn,&quot; another commented. &quot;I&#39;m 
surprised the weather&#39;s held out this long.&quot;

&quot;And the sky&#39;s a total mess,&quot; a third observed. She dared peek beyond 
her canopy, getting her face and glasses splashed. &quot;Gray as far as the 
eye can see. Weather like this makes you wonder if there was ever a 
sun.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be so theatrical!&quot; Fleur snapped. When they arrived, someone 
handed her a towel and some combs, and she straightened herself out as 
best she could. Leena had called an emergency meeting of the team, and 
this was the only place they could gather in conditions like this. 
Normally, Fleur wouldn&#39;t have bothered coming in bad weather- or 
sometimes even under favorable circumstances- but this time, even she 
could make exceptions. It&#39;s not every day your whole life is screwed 
over.

Well, unless you&#39;re Fleur Lacroix, of course.

&quot;Don&#39;t feel like you have to wait for me,&quot; she commanded her troops. 
&quot;I&#39;ll simply call for a taxi...or maybe some caring soul here will give 
me a ride.&quot; She smiled frostily and went in, flicking the last drops of 
rain from her hands. Her predecessors were a sorry sort: a dozen 
drenched rats sulking in the cold, shuddering for warmth and dreading 
the more dire storms to come. Fleur might have laughed at them, but now 
that they were all sharing in some misery, she could at last be 
generous, and feign pity. Some, admittedly, were as calm as her, taking 
this news (and the weather) quite well. She saw Terra nonchalantly 
reading one of those silly Japanese comics of hers, Jennifer playing 
with her cell phone, Kasumi flirting with Valencia, and Arina 
steadfastly reading. Rain grinned at her and waved her over: what a 
sweetheart, she had saved a seat.

&quot;I could make so many 300 jokes right now,&quot; she stated. Fleur winced.

&quot;Three what?&quot;

&quot;You know, something like, oh, &#39;the sky will rain black with arrows, and 
you shall now fight in the shade&#39;! You know, cuz&#39; it was pouring out 
there, and your group was like a phalanx with their umbrellas...&quot;

&quot;Try talking to me when you&#39;ve taken your meds,&quot; she answered coldly, 
huffing past and taking an abandoned seat. While it was true that Rain 
wasn&#39;t &quot;all there&quot; today, she was in fact much healthier than normal: 
she was starting to see good grades again. She distinctly heard Fleur 
sighing, &quot;Ignorance must really be bliss&quot;, then noticed Felicity coming 
in, looking beaten. Somehow Fausta had escaped nature&#39;s wrath- she 
looked like she just stepped out of a salon- but Shannon, carted in by a 
patient Elisa, looked downright disastrous. Rain laid down on the 
bleachers and stared at the ceiling until the meeting started; only Amy 
was absent.

&quot;Uh, hey everybody,&quot; Leena said not long after coming through the double 
doors, rainfall in her wake. &quot;Sorry to drag you all out here in this 
godforsaken weather, but it couldn&#39;t be helped. There&#39;s something we 
need to discuss, and it concerns the whole team. I&#39;m sure you all know 
what I mean.&quot; After a meaningful pause, Leena remarked, &quot;Where&#39;s 
Nguyen?&quot;

Everyone looked at Felicity. She just shrugged.

&quot;I guess I could call her now, but it&#39;s six-thirty. She&#39;ll still be 
working.&quot;

&quot;Try anyway. In the meantime, I need the rest of you to get this message 
to her, in case she can&#39;t make it. Now I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all aware of 
what&#39;s going on recently, and if you aren&#39;t, let me go over it quickly. 
Not long after we won our last two games, an anonymous tipster called 
the Chairman and accused us of paying the two teams to throw the game 
for us. Evidently, this person seems to have some convincing evidence, 
because the Chairman is taking these allegations seriously. Somehow or 
other, this was all leaked outside to the press, and ever since they got 
wind of it, everything has avalanched. The Chairman has since suspended 
us from playing any further games until the issue is resolved. He 
currently believes- hold on, let me finish- he believes that one of us, 
or several of us, had a direct hand in this, and has been going through 
your personal files and mine in an attempt to sieve out possible 
suspects. This is also his way of...I hate to even be thinking 
it...weeding out potential threats to the school. In summary, we&#39;re all 
under a big magnifying glass, and the Chairman can burn us whenever he 
chooses.&quot;

&quot;Um, Leena?&quot; said Lauren as she raised her hand. &quot;Can I just speak on 
behalf of the entire team and say what a load of donkey dung this is?&quot;

&quot;Hear, hear!&quot; Terra shouted.

&quot;Lauren, this is serious,&quot; Kasumi said. &quot;You might not have anything to 
worry about, but some of us like our privacy.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s what so fucking out of whack about this!&quot; she replied. &quot;We 
all know that Evil Lord Gary&#39;s been out for us ever since day one, and 
now someone&#39;s come along and dropped a way to get rid of us right into 
his lap! Do you honestly believe that ass-face is gonna play fair?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re seeing bogeymen everywhere,&quot; Elisa groaned. &quot;Most of us may not 
like him, but the Chairman is a professional. He&#39;s not some Grand 
Inquisitor who goes around blindly expelling everyone he doesn&#39;t like. 
And if he really were out to get us, don&#39;t you think he would&#39;ve at 
least kept the public out of this?&quot;

&quot;Hey, all I&#39;m saying is that he&#39;ll use any weapon he can get his grimy 
mitts on.&quot;

&quot;At the expense of the entire school?!&quot; she balked.

&quot;Settle down,&quot; Leena called out. &quot;I understand you&#39;re all frustrated, 
but this is the way things are now. I&#39;m sorry, but this is out of my 
hands. The best thing for you to do is to take this seriously, cooperate 
if you&#39;re asked to, go about your daily lives, and for the love of God, 
don&#39;t draw any unnecessary attention to yourself.&quot;

&quot;I ain&#39;t the one responsible!&quot; Lauren shrieked, feeling exposed.

&quot;I mean all of us,&quot; Leena said. &quot;I don&#39;t like this any more than any of 
you do, but right now we&#39;ll just have to bear it. Stick by each other 
and give your teammates support. We have to prove to everyone that we&#39;re 
better than their expectations.&quot;

&quot;How? By being good and obeying their orders?&quot;

&quot;That is precisely how we need to act, Miss Ofdensen. And if you can&#39;t 
do that, then bite your tongue and stay indoors until this is all over. 
The rest of you, I&#39;ll see you this Saturday. We might also have a 
meeting next Wednesday- umm, dressing up is optional, of course.&quot; A few 
girls chuckled; next week was Halloween. Leena added that they would not 
be having a meeting on the third of November, though she did not specify 
why, and before letting them go, assured them that she was always 
willing to help them if they needed her.

Before leaving the gym, Felicity walked up to her coach and said, 
&quot;Sorry, I couldn&#39;t reach her. I tried four times.&quot;

&quot;And when did you have the time to call her during this meeting?&quot; Leena 
smirked. She laughed at Felicity&#39;s expression and told her, &quot;That&#39;s 
okay. I&#39;ll bet I sounded pretty boring. Still, I didn&#39;t know which of 
you were still in the dark, so I had to be sure. Are you going to be 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Me? Sure, why?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Her smile sobered, and became almost motherly. &quot;It&#39;s just that 
when you first signed on, you looked like you had given up on living. It 
was like looking at a phantom- a very skilled phantom, but obviously one 
under very heavy stress. More than anyone should have, regardless of 
their age. I&#39;m sorry, that makes it sound like I was prying, doesn&#39;t 
it?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Felicity sighed, hanging her head a little. &quot;You&#39;re right, I was 
just going through a lot. And I still am, kind of, but I think I can 
handle it now. Really.&quot;

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll hold you to that. Hey, call me once you&#39;ve gotten hold 
of Amy, okay? I know she&#39;s supposed to be working right now, but 
something&#39;s bugging me about that. And...um, just between us, look out 
for Nadia, too. She looks as bad as you did when you first showed up.&quot; 
Felicity had noticed as well; it was impossible not to. Nadia looked as 
dark and dreary as the weather, and she had not even spoken during the 
entire meeting, not to her or Elisa or anyone. She walked like the 
living dead and might have wiped tears from her eyes as she came in from 
the rain; it was hard to tell. Nadia had been a friend and more to 
Felicity when she was going through her own Hell, and it was time to pay 
her back.

&quot;I&#39;ll definitely get on it. Thanks, Coach.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Although,&quot; she added wryly, once she was alone, &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what I did to deserve any thanks.&quot;

 

- Fleur Lacroix, family: Henry and Marie Lacroix; right midfielder- 

 

&quot;Damn it, I hate the rain.&quot; Shannon Threal looked up at the bleak, 
weeping sky for a moment as stray flecks tapped her face. She wiped them 
off with her sleeve and buried herself beneath a rain jacket. It was 
only a few steps to Elisa&#39;s car, but the weather was so unruly that it 
was more like swimming than walking. Three jackets would not have 
sufficed; only a fish could be comfortable in this rain. Elisa was 
soaked, too, but she wasn&#39;t fitful or ornery; Shannon acted like someone 
had thrown her into a trash bin and kicked her while she was down. She 
shivered and kept wiping her face; Elisa couldn&#39;t help but think she was 
crying. She wanted to say something to make her friend and roommate feel 
better, but she knew full well how ineffective her consolation would be. 
Instead she took a deep breath and drove out of the gymnasium parking 
lot.

Soon, however, even her modesty and consideration couldn&#39;t hold out much 
longer. &quot;Dear, I understand that this is a hard time for us all, but you 
know that if you need someone to talk to, I would be more than willing 
to listen. Really, don&#39;t hold back on my account.&quot;

&quot;No thanks,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;I don&#39;t wanna unload all my crap on you. I&#39;m 
just going through some tough shit right now. ...Uh, sorry about the 
language. I&#39;m just too freakin&#39; pissed off to mind what I say.&quot; Elisa 
giggled gently.

&quot;You never mind what you say, even when you&#39;re in a good mood.&quot; At last 
Shannon smiled.

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right. God, what a day for it to rain, huh?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I hear it won&#39;t be much better tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Crap. Well, it hasn&#39;t rained for a really long time- we had a bit of a 
drought this summah, didn&#39;t we?&quot;

&quot;Yes. I&#39;m glad things are, uh, precipitating well, but I&#39;d prefer soft 
gentle showers. If this keeps up, we&#39;ll have a flood.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Sheesh, that&#39;s the last thing we need. Hey Lisa?&quot;

&quot;Yes, dear?&quot; She hesitated, and tried to smile, if only to convey some 
of the gratitude she had for her infinitely patient and stalwart friend.

&quot;Uh, when we get back to the apahtment, maybe we can have some cocoa or 
coffee or whatevah it is ya want...&quot;

&quot;Hot tea, please. I&#39;ve just bought a box of ginger and I think you&#39;ll 
like it.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s swell,&quot; she replied warmly. &quot;And, uh, while we&#39;re relaxin&#39; and 
stuff, maybe I can let&#39;cha in on all this shit that&#39;s happening to me. 
Um, if ya still wanna hear it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s entirely up to you, dear. We can just sit and enjoy the silence.&quot;

&quot;I appreciate that,&quot; she said lovingly, &quot;but I think I owe it to ya. 
You&#39;ve been a saint and more to me evah since we moved in togethah, 
and...well, I figya ya wanna know more about me. Like I kind of owe ya.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you don&#39;t owe me anything,&quot; Elisa said sweetly. &quot;Except half the 
rent, of course!&quot;

&quot;Of course. But you did ask. Damn, I wish we had a garage. Or at least a 
fireplace.&quot; They pulled into the Hill n&#39; Dale Apartments parking lot, as 
close to their place as they could, and braced themselves for the 
downpour. Elisa let out a melodic sigh.

&quot;At least we&#39;ve got plenty of towels around. We&#39;re going to need them.&quot;

 

&quot;How&#39;s the tea?&quot;

&quot;Mmn, bettah than I hoped. Heh, you English and your teas.&quot;

&quot;Irish, darling, I&#39;m Irish. At least I think so. Do you need any more 
towels?&quot;

&quot;No thanks. I guess I already took a showah, huh?&quot;

&quot;Several by my count!&quot; Elisa chuckled. Shannon smiled and slurped her 
drink quietly. It didn&#39;t taste at all like she thought- evidently, 
ginger and gingerbread were two completely different flavors- it had a 
strange sweetness and a little tang to it, but it certainly warmed her 
up. Thankfully, the power had not gone off yet- they were only 
experiencing rain, not thunder- so they could converse, or just sit, in 
the light and heat.

&quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Shannon began, nursing her cup. &quot;I guess it ain&#39;t no 
stretch to say I played soccer long befoah I evah heard of Cahnegie. 
Prob&#39;ly as soon as I could walk, maybe even earlier. I was in the state 
finals every year of junya high, and we won for two of those years. I 
got into a fairly good team in high school, but my coach was a total 
pill, a by-the-book bitch if I evah saw one. Holly Yarlis, that&#39;s her 
name. We won state championship in my sophomore year, and we woulda won 
junya year, too, if some A-hole from hell didn&#39;t fuck things up. Oops.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t mind,&quot; Elisa said with a smile. &quot;Use whatever language best 
befits your story.&quot; Shannon&#39;s smile grew brighter as she took another 
swig. Mmm, this ginger tea only got better the further down she went. 
She&#39;d have to buy a box herself.

&quot;Well, all right, if you say so. Anyway, lemme skip ahead a bit to this 
one game we was playin&#39;. There were some scouts there- you know, for 
colleges and big schools like that- and I was seven-hundred degrees of 
psyched about it. I was literally giddy, okay- like bouncing around, 
ready to burst. To gals like us, scouts meant a full ride scholarship. 
They meant fame and glory. They meant an education. For me, that meant a 
future. I would&#39;ve done all kinds of demeanin&#39; things to get their 
attention. And...that&#39;s sort of where this story takes a turn.&quot;

&quot;Oh, dear, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t say any more, then,&quot; Elisa whispered. 
&quot;I think I can connect the rest of the story myself. You were caught 
doing...something...and you&#39;re afraid that now we&#39;re being under 
investigation, it&#39;ll come back to haunt you.&quot;

&quot;No, but you&#39;re close,&quot; she replied quietly. &quot;You&#39;re very close. Let me 
explain everything befoah you throw ya pity pahty. There was this one 
gal on the team- I mentioned her earliah- her name was Trudy Vong. Brr! 
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll evah forget that name for as long as I live! She was 
a dyke, Lisa, and the worst kind you could imagine. It&#39;s thanks to her 
that I get all suspicious around the rest of the team. Well, you know. 
Those o&#39; them that&#39;re like that. I mean, I like you and Kasumi okay- 
ahh, but getting back to the story, Trudy was an ogah. That&#39;s the only 
way I could describe her. She was an ogah and a bitch, and she had it in 
for me. We were perfect on the field, though, which actually made things 
worse. One day, after the game with the scouts watchin&#39;, everyone took 
showahs, and I, of course, waited my turn. I nevah liked showerin&#39; with 
othah gals, even if they was my friends. It just made me feel awkward, 
and I&#39;ve always liked my privacy. Well. I got the last stall and took my 
time, and guess who should show up to point her big ugly dyke nose 
around but you-know-who.&quot;

&quot;Uh-oh,&quot; Elisa murmured.

&quot;Yeah, exactly. But it gets worse. She always picked the showah next to 
me cuz&#39; she thought I was some closet case, and since she already slept 
with like half the team- hell, maybe even alla them- she evidently 
thought I was next on the list. So we had our little spat as usual, and 
I tried to ignore her, and then she says she got this intahview with The 
Boston Globe. I dunno about you, Leese, but that was enough to get my 
attention, and that rat-bastahd of a bitch knew it. She also knew I&#39;d do 
damn near anything to have my name dropped, so, uh...we sorta made this 
deal.&quot;

&quot;Do I want to know what it was?&quot; Elisa asked sickly. Shannon sighed 
deeply.

&quot;She stuck her fucking nasty tongue down my throat and I was fucking 
stupid enough to let her! I shoulda nevah let that ass-face get the 
bettah of me and I&#39;ve been payin&#39; for it evah since! One stupid little 
mistake and it&#39;s come back to haunt me all these years later! GOD 
FUCKING DAMN IT!!&quot; Elisa jerked back, spilling some of her tea, as 
Shannon crashed her fists into the chair&#39;s armrest, sending a small 
vibration across the entire apartment. But then, Shannon started to cry, 
and she quickly raked her forearm over her face, sniffling hoarsely.

&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to erupt like that. It just brings some bad 
memories back. I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Perfectly all right, dear!&quot; Elisa exclaimed breathlessly, still reeling 
from the shock. &quot;After hearing what happened, I can understand your 
anger. I&#39;d be infuriated as well if she did that to me. Please tell me 
you didn&#39;t...ah...have sex with that whore!&quot;

&quot;No, thank God,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;We just kissed, ugh. But she nevah meant 
to hold up her enda the deal. She just wanted to get undah my fucking 
panties and- aw, hell, I know we was both naked, but you know what I 
mean- all she wanted was to fucking sleep with me! She pushed me too 
far, so I pushed back. Well, I hit her, anyway. Hahd. Too hahd. She 
slipped and fell, got a concussion...went to the freakin&#39; hospital...and 
guess who gets busted for assault?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s horrible!&quot; Elisa exclaimed. &quot;You should&#39;ve been given a medal!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Shannon had never been so surprised that she actually spat her 
drink out, until now. She had to clean it off her clothes and towels as 
she sputtered and coughed.

&quot;Yes!&quot; Elisa exclaimed haughtily. &quot;You went too easy on her! You 
should&#39;ve bitten her tongue off before punching her.&quot; Shannon couldn&#39;t 
help but laugh after hearing her sweet, humble, meek little roommate say 
something so blatantly out of character, but she was also laughing 
because Elisa was on her side, and that made her feel happier than she 
had been in years.

&quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; she admitted cheerfully. &quot;And even if I had, 
that would&#39;ve meant I&#39;d have to kiss her again.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Good point.&quot; They laughed again; Shannon was glowing once she 
calmed down and finished her tea. That made telling the rest of her 
story much easier.

&quot;Anyway, Shannon Threal didn&#39;t look so hot anymoah now that she had an 
assault rep. Scholahships dried up and mosta my friends abandoned me, 
even though they knew perfectly well what a rat that Trudy was, and that 
she got what was comin&#39; to her. Scott was the only person who believed 
me, aside from mom and pops. Gettin&#39; inta this school and havin&#39; the 
chance to play again was like a dream come true, and I&#39;ll be damned if 
all that shit comes to surface again aftah all the hard work I&#39;ve been 
through. Anyway, that&#39;s the end of my sordid history. Sorry I went all 
drama queen on you.&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s no apologies necessary, sweetheart,&quot; Elisa said lovingly. She 
got up and walked over to Shannon, kneeling down so she could give her a 
hug. &quot;You&#39;re a good person, and a wonderful friend. I feel so blessed to 
have you here. I&#39;d like to say &#39;I love you&#39;, but I really don&#39;t know how 
that would make you feel.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t hafta be that considerate,&quot; she grinned, folding her arms 
around Elisa. &quot;I love you too, ya know.&quot;

 

- Rain Howlet, family: Levi, Karen, &amp; Frank Howlet; defensive 
midfielder- 

 

As Elisa predicted (or more accurately, the forecasters), Thursday 
morning was just as wet and dreary as the day before, although at least 
the rain had calmed into a steady stream. Shiki Araya drove Maria and 
Freya as close to the school entrance as she could get, then scurried 
outside, opening a large umbrella so her two lovers wouldn&#39;t get soaked. 
Maria gave her a smile and a wink as thanks; Freya was drawn into an 
embrace.

&quot;Be careful, Miss. I promise I&#39;ll do everything in my power to help with 
this investigation and clear the team&#39;s name.&quot;

&quot;Just make sure it&#39;s inside the law this time,&quot; she replied playfully. 
They kissed deeply before parting; a few observers saw them and 
whistled. Maria helped Freya inside and waved to Shiki, looking just a 
little bit smug. Shiki was jealous, of course, but at least she could 
rest easy, knowing her mistress was in relatively good hands.

As they wandered into the halls and became lost in the sea of humanity, 
Maria quickly said to Freya, &quot;I know you&#39;ve heard us say this before, 
but are you sure you&#39;re going to be okay? I mean, you&#39;re the team 
manager and all, and I know that&#39;s gotta be stressful enough, but now 
all this has come down on us, and you don&#39;t normally take drastic news 
well.&quot;

&quot;I do admit that I haven&#39;t been feeling that good,&quot; she replied weakly. 
&quot;But I can still walk, can&#39;t I?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but if they open an investigation on the team, they&#39;ll know all 
about my father&#39;s suicide, and your mother&#39;s death, then it&#39;ll be like 
two years ago all over again. I can&#39;t be put through something like 
that.&quot;

&quot;You won&#39;t,&quot; Freya assured her feebly. &quot;I&#39;m a much stronger person now. 
I can handle bad news better. Still, I&#39;m grateful for your concern. 
Well, it looks like this is where we go our separate ways.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Maria glanced at the hallway, and gave Freya a loving hug, 
adding a deep kiss of her own. &quot;I&#39;d like to say &#39;be careful&#39; as well, 
but you&#39;re smart enough to handle yourself. You know where I&#39;ll be in 
case you need me.&quot;

&quot;Yes. You take care, too!&quot; Freya took a deep breath and wobbled her way 
down the hallway, sparing one last glimpse at her parting friend. She 
didn&#39;t dare tell Maria how much weaker she was getting- how she wasn&#39;t 
able to eat certain foods, how she had spent several nights cold even 
with blankets and heat, how sometimes she expelled blood when she used 
the lady&#39;s room, how her muscles occasionally gave out at unpredictable 
intervals- she couldn&#39;t let her be more concerned than she already was. 
But it was foolish, really: she would find out sooner or later.

Freya was proud of herself for making it all the way to Ms. Connors&#39; 
Networking lab and lecture without any assistance. She even felt giddy: 
blood rushed to her head and the weight of the world rolled off, like a 
boulder, as she felt herself floating to the ceiling. She stretched her 
arms out to catch herself, and felt them shrivel up beneath her 
weightless ascent. Consciousness teased her and the world became melodic 
as muffled voices spoke to her, like disembodied spirits. It was all 
silence and darkness from then on out.
