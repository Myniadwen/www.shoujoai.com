In the deserted park in Tokyo the winter mists rolled
and churned wildly near the ground as a ruby light
flared brighter and brighter from midair. Finally in a
burst of power the path between worlds was opened up
and a very tanned and well rested looking Juri
Arisugawa and Setsuna Meiou emerged from the rift.

&quot;About time,&quot; Haruka Tenoh muttered, the boyish
looking blonde stamping her booted feet in the winter
chill.

&quot;Cold!&quot; Setsuna squealed, the black haired woman
hurrying with as much dignity as she could muster to
grab a coat held out to her.

&quot;Here you go,&quot; Michiru Kaoru said with some amusement.
The green haired woman looked at them with a bit of
envy, &quot;Was it warmer where you were?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s almost perpetually summer on Gaia,&quot; Juri
explained as the orange haired woman calmly grabbed at
her coat, carried by Haruka.

&quot;Damn,&quot; Haruka muttered softly, &quot;remind me to borrow
that thing and go there with Michiru when it gets
colder.&quot;

Setsuna looked amused as they trooped towards the
waiting car, &quot;Just be prepared for a rather
interesting trip.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Michiru looked curious.

They reached the car, Juri and Haruka moving to
politely open doors. &quot;Well,&quot; Juri took up the story,
&quot;first, Hitomi and Milerna arranged a false attack on
us for fun. Then as we were traveling we were attacked
by real pirates, and had to fight.&quot;

&quot;You obviously won,&quot; Haruka said as she started up the
car, Michiru putting on her seat belt in the
passenger&#39;s side.

&quot;Yes, but things got interesting after the ship
crashed,&quot; Setsuna murmured as she tiredly rested her
head on Juri&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Long walk?&quot; Michiru chuckled.

&quot;Not too bad after we ran into the catgirl village,&#39;
Juri grinned.

&quot;Try and stay awake, by the way,&quot; Haruka added, &quot;I&#39;m
pretty sure Hotaru&#39;s been waiting up for you.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Setsuna promised even as she fought
back a yawn. She looked over at her partner with an
indulgent smile, &quot;It&#39;s okay, Juri.&quot;

Juri jerked her hand away from her pocket guiltily,
&quot;Eh?&quot;

Setsuna chuckled softly, &quot;We&#39;ve been away for weeks,
it&#39;s perfectly natural you want to check up on the
bar.&quot;

Juri took her cellphone out as she asked, &quot;You don&#39;t
mind?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead.,&quot; Setsuna nudged her, &quot;I want to know too.&quot;

Permission granted Juri dialed away. &quot;It&#39;s me,&quot; she
said as the phone was picked up. She paused, &quot;What do
you mean, who is it?&quot;

Ryouko chuckled softly as she leaned up against the
bar, &quot;Just yanking your chain a bit.&quot; The blue haired
space pirate had been cleaning up in preperation for
closing time, the rest of their staff busy as they
tidied up. Covering the mouth piece she called to the
others, &quot;Juri&#39;s back!&quot;

&quot;Is everything okay?&quot; Juri asked, even though she felt
in her gut it would be.

&quot;The bar hasn&#39;t burnt down,&quot; Ryouko reassured her, &quot;in
fact, we&#39;ve been as busy as ever. I really think May&#39;s
grown into the assistant manager&#39;s job.&quot;

&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll take days off more often,&quot; Juri said, a
smile pulling at her lips.

&quot;That may be so,&quot; Setsuna sounded amused, &quot;but I doubt
it.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Juri,&quot; May&#39;s voice came on the line, &quot;welcome
home.&quot;

May was a beautiful, brown haired young woman who just
happened to be fully cybernetic. That didn&#39;t stop her
from being a great host and a kind person, in fact
Juri Occasionally thought those qualities enhanced it.

&quot;It&#39;s good to be back,&quot; Juri admitted. &quot;I&#39;ve missed
you guys.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve missed you, too,&quot; May agreed. With a smile she
added, &quot;Things have gone pretty well, though I suspect
some of our longer clients have missed you as well.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Juri sat back, loving the feel of Setsuna by
her side, &quot;I should be back in a day or so, once I&#39;ve
caught up on my sleep.&quot;

&quot;Take your time,&quot; Minagi jumped in, the twin of Ryouko
sounding amused, &quot;no need to cut short your
honeymoon.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna chuckled, &quot;we appreciate that.&quot;

&quot;Just about there,&quot; Haruka called from the front.

&quot;We&#39;d better go,&quot; Juri took the phone back, &quot;but I
promise to catch up in a few days.&quot;

&quot;See you then,&quot; Excel jumped in, the blonde sounding
as energetic as usual.

Juri chuckled as they pulled up the driveway, then
climbed out of the car. &quot;No yawning,&quot; Michiru
cautioned, &quot;we&#39;re tired too, and you&#39;ll put us right
out.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Juri said before muffling a yawn.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Setsuna gently punched her arm.

&quot;We&#39;re home,&quot; Haruka yelled as she swung the now
unlocked front door open.

&quot;Mommy!&quot; Hotaru Tomoe cried happily as the black
haired girl hurried by Haruka to throw her arms around
Setsuna, &quot;I missed you.&quot;

&quot;Missed you too, little one,&quot; Setsuna hugged Hotaru,
feeling a surge of happiness. She loved Juri, but this
young woman also held a piece of her heart.

&quot;Juri,&quot; Hotaru slipped free to hug a visibly startled
Juri too.

Watching Juri stiffen then awkwardly hug Hotaru back,
Haruka had to fight down the urge to chuckle. &quot;Have
you been eating sugar?&quot; she wondered at Hotaru&#39;s
abnormally excited behavior.

Hotaru blushed faintly as she released Juri, &quot;Just the
last of my Halloween candy.&quot;

&quot;That would explain it,&quot; Michiru agreed.

&quot;If you&#39;re too hyper to sleep,&quot; Haruka warned, &quot;you&#39;re
on your own.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Poppa,&quot; Hotaru said, sounding just like any
normal put upon teenager.

Juri had to grin at that, then fought back a yawn.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said apologetically, &quot;I think we&#39;d better
hit the hay.&quot;

&quot;But we will see you in the morning,&quot; Setsuna
promised.

&quot;Just not very early in the morning,&quot; Juri felt
obligated to add.

Hotaru laughed, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll see you then.&quot;

&quot;She really is scary when she&#39;s that perky,&quot; Juri
mused to Setsuna later as they settled into their
attached suite.

&quot;She does that occasionally,&quot; Setsuna agreed as she
changed into her nightie. She gave Juri a amused look,
&quot;She really startled you with that hug.&quot;

Juri stripped off her dress and grabbed her older
nightie, one well worn and comfortable. &quot;Sort of,&quot; she
agreed as they climbed into bed, &quot;I knew Hotaru liked
me, but...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re now one of her group of mommies,&quot; Setsuna
chuckled.

Juri lay back as she mused, &quot;I suppose so.&quot; She
reached out to gently pull Setsuna close, &quot;But since
she comes along with you, I suppose it&#39;s worth it.&quot;

&quot;Charmer,&quot; Setsuna laughed as she snuggled close.
Reaching out to turn off the lights they lay there in
companionable silence, then she shifted a bit. &quot;Juri?&quot;
she asked softly, letting her breath tickle her wife&#39;s
ear.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Juri asked, shivering a bit as Setsuna stroked
her arm.

&quot;How tired are you, really?&quot; Setsuna cooed.

Juri grinned as she turned to face Setsuna, &quot;Not that
tired...&quot;</pre>
