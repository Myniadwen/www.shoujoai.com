<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 77 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../excel/index.html">Excel Saga</a>

<a href="../excel/locket-ch76.html">Back to Part 76</a><pre>&quot;So, what&#39;s got you so down?&quot; Minagi asked the good
looking black haired woman in the Asian dress. She had
a top knot added to her dark mane and most strangely a
panther purred softly at her feet.

&quot;My latest campaign to earn my true love&#39;s heart has
failed,&quot; Lily confessed with a sigh as she sipped her
drink. Even as she drank she kept half an eye on the
book in front of her, the latest work by Hisami
Hisaishi.

&quot;Who&#39;s that, Lily?&quot; Nancy Mukahari asked, dressed in
her usual one piece black leather combat suit.

&quot;Anita King,&quot; Lily sighed dreamily.

&quot;The kid?&quot; Minagi blinked at the woman in surprise,
her long blue hair flowing in a wild looking mane,
twin scars on her cheeks.

&quot;She is not a kid,&quot; Lily protested fiercely, nearly
bouncing up out of her seat.

&quot;Yes, she is,&quot; Nancy forcefully yanked Lily back into
her chair.

&quot;Ow,&quot; Lily yelped in pain as her butt was forced back
down onto the seat. &quot;Okay,&quot; she conceded, &quot;but I&#39;m
willing to wait till she grows up a bit.&quot; A dreamy
look passed over Lily&#39;s face, &quot;Anita&#39;s so fierce and
true...&quot;

&quot;Aren&#39;t you on opposite sides?&quot; Nancy noted dryly.

Lily hesitated for a moment then she softly said, &quot;I
think I&#39;d give up my wicked ways just for her.&quot;

&quot;Reminds me of me and Yomiko,&quot; Nancy conceded after a
moment, taking a drink.

&quot;True,&quot; Ryouko sweapt by on her way to deliver more
drinks to a customer up the bar.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Wendy Earhart nodded to Ryouko as she
took her two drinks. The lovely blonde tried to look
serious in her sleek black suit, but a faint smile
still tugged at the cute young woman&#39;s lips.

&quot;You want to go talk to them?&quot; Ryouko nodded
significantly towards Lily and Nancy. &quot;You have things
in common.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d better not, considering our pasts,&quot; Wendy
answered her a bit sadly. Perking up a bit she worked
her way past the kareoke stage over towards the
library as she saw a familiar figure and said, &quot;Here
you are.&quot;

Nenene Sumiregawa looked up with a smile, the brown
haired author holding up one of her own books. &quot;Looks
like I made it here, too,&quot; she noted, her overlarge
glasses gleaming. She wore casual clothes, including a
baggy sweater and jeans.

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Wendy chuckled as they sat down together.
She offered Nenene a drink as she said,
&quot;Congradulations on your latest book, by the way.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nenene took the drink and sipped a bit.
&quot;What did you expect to happen, when you showed up at
my apartment after Joker&#39;s death?&quot;

Wendy looked at her curiously, wondering why she was
bringing this up now. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what I expected,&quot;
she admitted, &quot;I had just found myself remembering how
good it had felt to talk to you, even when we were
enemies.&quot;

Nenene chuckled softly at that. &quot;You made a good
villain,&quot; she noted, &quot;but when I looked in your eyes I
saw gentleness.&quot;

&quot;You were always too perceptive,&quot; Wendy admitted. A
little shake of her head, &quot;You saw right to the root
of things at the end, making me really see what we
were doing to ourselves.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a writer,&quot; Nenene shrugged, &quot;it&#39;s what we do.&quot;

Wendy chuckled, &quot;A little egotistical love?&quot;

Nenene grinned back, &quot;Always.&quot;

Hurrying by May smiled, her maid&#39;s uniform swirling
around her. Smiling at her boyish girlfriend she
asked, &quot;Did you notice we have multiples again?&quot;

Keiko nodded, her brown braid bouncing against her
black suit jacket. &quot;I counted at least three Nenene&#39;s,
I think,&quot; she said seriously. &quot;Do you think we should
try to keep them apart?&quot;

&quot;Probably not a bad idea,&quot; May conceded, &quot;I&#39;ll ask
Juri...&quot;

Keiko smiled wryly as she interrupted, &quot;You&#39;re in
charge while Juri&#39;s on her honeymoon, remember?&quot;

May blushed, &quot;I forgot.&quot;

&quot;Why don&#39;t you tell Nabiki,&quot; Keiko offered, &quot;while I
get Alpha, Excel and Hyatt to run interference?&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; May kissed Keiko gently then hurried off
through the crowd of women to look for their resident
business manager.

Meanwhile, out on the dance floor, another Nenene
patiently guided a taller woman in the steps of a
dance. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe you&#39;ve never learned
this,&quot; Nenene smiled up at her girlfriend warmly.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Maggie Mui said, the tall, black haired woman
holding Nenene carefully in her arms as they swayed to
the music.

&quot;Still,&quot; Nenene sighed happily as she let her head
rest on Maggie&#39;s shoulder, &quot;you do learn fast.&quot;

Maggie blushed charmingly even as the music sped up a
bit, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Pulling them apart she carefully let
Nenene swing out, spin, then drew her close without
tripping this time. &quot;Whew,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;Nice,&quot; Nenene agreed, a bit of red coloring her own
cheeks. A sly smile, &quot;It makes me glad I got tired of
waiting and just asked you out.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you did,&quot; Maggie said to her quietly. A
slight smile, &quot;I wanted to ask you, but I was too
shy.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Nenene reached up to caress Maggie&#39;s cheek,
&quot;but it&#39;s one of your more charming qualities.&quot;

As Alpha collected a round of drinks the green haired
android asked Ryouko, &quot;So, multiple incarnations of
the same person can be at the bar at the same time?&quot;

Ryouko nodded as she poured a drink for another
customer, &quot;It has to do with parallel timelines. Each
choice we can make leads to a new world, etc. It&#39;s
just our good luck that the bar can access those
various worlds.&quot;

&quot;Must be difficult to keep track,&quot; Alpha noted.

&quot;It can be interesting,&quot; Ryouko admitted. She smiled
impishly, &quot;Ask Sasami to tell you about the invasion
of multiple Juris sometime.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Alpha smiled then hurried off to drop off her
drinks. &quot;Here you go,&quot; she passed a drink over then
hesitated, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to have to card you.&quot;

&quot;Why does this always happen to me?&quot; Anita King
complained, the young woman pulling out her wallet and
showing it to Alpha.

&quot;Because you&#39;re so cute?&quot; Nenene asked, her grin
wicked.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Alpha said once she finished checking the
twenty year old&#39;s identification. &quot;Is there anything
else I can get you?&quot; she asked politely.

&quot;No, we&#39;re good,&quot; Anita smiled. She looked over at
Nenene, &quot;Neat place you&#39;ve chosen for our first
official date.&quot;

&quot;Considering how patient you&#39;ve been with me, I
figured you deserved something nice,&quot; Nenene admitted.

Anita put her hand over Nenene&#39;s and smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve
loved you a long time, you know.&quot; A grin, &quot;Even when
you were irritating the hell out of me.&quot;

&quot;Hey, join the club squirt,&quot; Nenene shot back, &quot;you
were cute even when you were being totally
aggravating.&quot;

&quot;So what took you so long to agree to go out with me?&quot;
Anita asked.

&quot;I didn&#39;t want to get killed by your sisters Michelle
or Maggie,&quot; Nenene said dryly, getting a snort of
laughter from Anita. Softly she added, &quot;And I wanted
to be sure it wasn&#39;t just you getting over Hisami or
me rebounding from Yomiko.&quot;

Anita sighed as she said, &quot;Yeah, they were hard on
both of us. But, I think things worked out for the
best.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Nenene smiled.

To be continued...
