The lanky blonde put her cigarette out before walking up to the front 
door where she nodded to the bouncer, &quot;Hey, Bones.&quot;

&quot;Hi, Hamako,&quot; the black haired woman waved her on by.

Hamako Shihonmatsu paused in the dark hallway, taking a moment to 
straighten out her leather jacket. Her white T-shirt was snug fitting, 
and the blue jeans hugged her hips. &#39;Hope she likes this,&#39; she thought 
nervously as she looked down at her clothes. Her own nervousness 
surprised her a bit, but she tried not to let it bother her.

Hitomi smiled at the boyishly butch woman cheerfully as she emerged 
from the hall, &quot;Nice to see you again, Hamako.&quot;

Hamako smiled back as she asked her, &quot;Has a red-headed, slightly 
nervous looking young lady been in yet?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, just a few minutes ago,&quot; Hitomi smiled. She looked up at Hamako 
thoughtfully and asked, &quot;Is she your date?&quot;

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Hamako ran her hand through her slightly wind- 
blown, short hair. &quot;Hope this place doesn&#39;t scare her too badly,&quot; she 
muttered, her green eyes narrowing slightly as she scanned the crowd 
for her date.

&quot;I saw her heading towards the library,&quot; Hitomi volunteered gently.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Hamako smiled at her before heading into the crush of 
people.

She saw a flash of red hair in the wild crowd, but it was just A-ko 
arguing with B-ko again. C-ko sat at a nearby table, sipping at a 
soda. She shook her head and moved on, remembering how she first met 
her. Hamako had just been coming into work at the animation studio 
when she saw the formally dressed young woman looking around her in 
pure bewilderment.

Introducing herself, the redhead responded with her name, Mikiko 
Oguro, though she was quickly given the nickname of Kuromi. The new 
production manager and her had a bit of a rough start, but they soon 
hit it off pretty well. They managed to push the illustrators and 
others to get the project done in time, and had arranged to hold a 
victory celebration.

&#39;Which brings us here,&#39; Hamako thought nervously. &#39;Why on Earth did I 
decide to bring her out to the Locket?&#39; she worried as she looked 
intently around her for that bright red hair. &#39;I don&#39;t even know if 
she likes girls.&#39;

Hamako finally spotted her, leaning up against one of the bookcases 
and flipping through a white trade paperback thoughtfully. The redhead 
looked much more casual now, dressed in a loose skirt and comfortable 
blouse. There was a bit of a flush to Kuromi&#39;s cheeks, and her blue 
eyes were wide as she read.

Hamako got a good look at the paperback that she was reading and 
chuckled softly, thinking, &#39;One by Pat Califia, it figures.&#39;

Kuromi heard the warm chuckle and looked up with a smile on her face, 
&quot;Hi, Hamako.&quot;

&quot;Hi,&quot; Hamako smiled back at her shyly. &#39;God, she&#39;s cute,&#39; she thought.

Kuromi noticed the book she was still holding and went read. She 
quickly pushed it back into it&#39;s place before exclaiming, &quot;I was just 
looking at it.&quot;

Hamako smiled at the younger woman gently, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve flipped 
through more than one book in here.&quot;

&quot;It was certainly educational,&quot; Kuromi looked down shyly.

&quot;Do you want to get a drink?&quot; Hamako asked her.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Kuromi smiled up at her happily. They moved out together into 
the crowd, and Hamako made sure to keep a protective arm across the 
girl&#39;s shoulders.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Keiko bustled by, her boy&#39;s school uniform hugging her 
closely as her long brown braid swung behind her. Hamako blinked in 
surprise as she noticed Kuromi&#39;s quite interested gaze following her.

&quot;She&#39;s a girl, by the way,&quot; Hamako grinned.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Kuromi blushed furiously.

Before Hamako could tease her any more they reached the busy bar, and 
took in the twin&#39;s performance there. Ryouko tossed a beer bottle in 
the air, ignighting her energy sword at the same time. As it dropped 
the blue haired woman smoothly cut across the falling bottle, then the 
beer dropped down right into an waiting empty beer glass. The halves 
of the bottle then splashed down into the garbage bin.

The crowd spontaneously broke into a round of applause even as Minagi 
picked up the glass of beer and passed it to Misato, &quot;Your order, 
ma&#39;am!&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Misato Kisaragi grinned, drinking her beer happily.

&quot;Hi, Minagi,&quot; Hamako smiled cheerfully.

The girl with the scars on her face smiled cheerfully, &quot;You want your 
regular sake?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Hamako smiled, then she looked over at Kuromi, &quot;What would 
you like?&quot;

&quot;Just a rum and coke, please,&quot; Kuromi smiled shyly.

Ryouko looked over at Kuromi, &quot;You&#39;re new here, right?&quot; At Kuromi&#39;s 
nod she laughed, &quot;Juri would be over here greeting you right about 
now, but she&#39;s a bit busy.&quot; At the curious gazes from both Kuromi and 
Hamako she nodded to the dance floor, where Juri and Setsuna were 
gently swaying together to the music.

&quot;They&#39;re beautiful,&quot; Kuromi murmured softly.

&quot;That they are,&quot; Hamako agreed softly, but she was looking at Kuromi. 
The girl blushed faintly, looking down. Taking a chance Hamako asked 
her softly, &quot;Would you like to try it?&quot;

&quot;Dance?&quot; Kuromi squeaked softly. She smiled up at Hamako, her cheeks 
still faintly red and said, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

Hamako took Kuromi&#39;s hand in hers, leading her out onto the dance 
floor. It was a slower number, and she nervously put her arms around 
the shorter girl&#39;s waist as they gently began to sway together. Kurumi 
snuggled closer, and she smiled up at Hamako happily.

&quot;You&#39;re pretty good at this,&quot; Hamako murmured to her softly after a 
few moments.

&quot;So are you,&quot; Kurumi answered softly. She looked up at Hamako, her 
blue eyes meeting Hamako&#39;s green ones as she softly asked, &quot;Could we 
do this again, sometime?&quot;

&#39;Guess it&#39;s a start,&#39; Hamako thought even as she smiled down at her, 
&quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

The Staff: The bar&#39;s owner is Arisugawa Juri, from Revolutionary Girl 
Utena. Minagi and Ryouko are from the series Tenchi Muyo. Keiko is 
also from Utena. And finally, Hitomi is from Escaflowne, the movie.

Our Cast This Episode: Hamako Shihonmatsu and Mikiko (Kuromi) Oguro 
are from Animation Runner Kuromi. A-ko, B-ko and C-ko are from Project 
A-ko. Misato Kisaragi is from Neon Genesis Evangelion. And finally, 
Setsuna is from Sailor Moon.

Author&#39;s Note: I&#39;ve only seen the first episode of Animation Runner 
Kuromi, but Hamako and Kuromi were just so cute together I couldn&#39;t 
resist. Pat Califia, for those who may not know, if an author of 
lesbian and gay erotica, including the book Melting Point. How do I 
know this? You&#39;d be surprised what you can find at the library... </pre>
