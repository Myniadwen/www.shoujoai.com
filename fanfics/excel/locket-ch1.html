<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 1 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../excel/index.html">Excel Saga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The small two story building was in a slightly disreputable part of 
Tokyo, but it stood out from the buildings around it. Unlike the run 
down buildings that were all around it, it was very well maintained. 
On the front of the building a newly erected pink neon sign glows in 
the fading daylight, reading in elegant script &quot;Arisugawa&#39;s Locket.&quot; 
Hanging just below it, a animated sign shows a locket opening and 
closing, revealing a cartoon of a pretty girl inside of it.

Standing nearby the main entrance, Arisugawa Juri looked around the 
large room calmly, hiding any signs of the nervousness she might be 
feeling on this opening night. She took a quick walk around the bar to 
make sure that everything was all right for the grand opening they 
planned for later that evening.

She slid her hand along the top of the bar to check for cleanness, and 
gave a smooth smile to her two new bartenders. The twins were cleaning 
glasses and sorting the liquor bottles, Ryouko at one end, Minagi 
standing at the other. They were like night and day in their 
personalities, but both could sling drinks with the best of them.

She cleared her throat to get their attention. &quot;How&#39;s the setup we 
built for you?&quot; Juri asked the two of them pleasantly.

Ryouko snorted disagreeably, and Minagi gave her a scolding look. 
&quot;What my nasty elder sister means,&quot; Minagi said with a small smile, 
&quot;is that the bar&#39;s great. I don&#39;t see us having any problems.&quot; She 
stopped talking and looked at Juri with a bit of concern, &quot;Would you 
like me to make you something?&quot;

Juri shook her head even as she reassured her with a small smile. 
&quot;I&#39;ll just get myself a cup of coffee from the kitchen,&quot; she said as 
she left them there with a casual wave of her hand. She walked along 
the length of the bar to the mostly concealed door at the far end, 
pushing it open to reveal the pantry just beyond. She did a casual 
check of the shelves, then went through another door there into the 
busy kitchen itself.

Sasami calmly directed the several cooks in preparing the various 
dishes, never raising her voice or losing her sweet looking smile. 
Juri had been a bit dubious about hiring a young girl like her, but 
once she was reminded of Sasami&#39;s cooking skills, not to mention her 
true age, she decided not to worry too much about it.

&quot;Hey, Sasami,&quot; Juri said to her with a easy smile. Sasami turned to 
her and without any prompting from Juri handed her a fresh cup of 
coffee, prepared just the way she liked it. &quot;How did you know.. ?&quot; 
Juri started to ask her, honestly surprised.

Sasami smiled, pointing to a phone that was mounted up on the wall 
nearby, &quot;Minagi just called me to let me know.&quot; As Sasami said this, 
little hearts throbbed in her eyes. Juri felt a bit relieved that 
Sasami wasn&#39;t suddenly becoming telepathic or something. Before Juri 
could say anything more, Sasami was back at work orchestrating the 
meals for the evening.

Deciding not to disrupt Sasami&#39;s hard work any more than she might 
have already done, Juri headed back out to the bar, and then out 
across the large dance floor itself. The hardwood floor was smoothly 
polished, all ready for the feet of any patrons who might want to trip 
the light fantastic later tonight.

&quot;Music,&quot; Juri called out quietly, and the high quality sound system 
she&#39;d ordered installed came on, the music seemingly coming from all 
sides. &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said with a grin, and it cut off again as smooth 
as silk. It was an effort to force herself to return to her normally 
cool appearance as she continued onward.

Several dining tables were set up on once side, informally arranged 
with chairs and settings that were able to be switched around as 
needed. Juri had originally thought of having a more &#39;fine dining&#39; set 
up, but Sasami and the other restaurant staff had convinced her it 
didn&#39;t go with the feel she wanted in the place. A group of the 
barmaids were over there, making sure that everything was all right.

Keiko blushed under Juri&#39;s gaze, her two ponytails swinging as she 
gushed out, &quot;Hello, Juri-sama!&quot; Juri sighed at that, but she didn&#39;t 
try to correct her. It didn&#39;t do any good anyway, as Keiko just 
ignored her and kept calling her that.

Cyberdoll May smiled over at her cheerfully, &quot;Hello, Ms. Arisugawa.&quot;

&quot;Juriii!&quot; Excel yelled happily, glomping Juri and sending the taller 
woman staggering about helplessly before she finally slid down Juri&#39;s 
back and released her. Juri again found herself wondering if Excel and 
Wakaba were related somehow.

Hyatt gave Juri a languid wave from where she had collapsed into a 
nearby chair. Not for the first time did Juri wonder where the two of 
them had come from, but they did seem to work well together. Besides, 
she needed the help.

Just beyond the tables was a group of chairs and couches nearby a 
fireplace, and a feature that Juri knew would make many of the guests 
talk. The library was four tall bookcases, all well stocked, and each 
carrying a variety of both lesbian fiction and nonfiction. She noticed 
someone sitting quietly in one of the couches reading a Naiad 
publication, and chuckled softly.

&quot;Did all the invitations get delivered?&quot; a smiling Juri asked the 
brown hared girl lounging there. Hitomi scrambled out of the chair and 
up to her feet, hiding the book behind her back as she blushed 
fiercely. She was wearing her old school uniform, despite her being 
out of school for quite a while. For just a moment, Juri saw what 
looked like white wings shimmer around the girl, though they 
disappeared just as fast.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Hitomi said with a smile, &quot;I hand delivered them all.&quot; 
She stopped, and looked at Juri a bit anxiously, &quot;Is it still OK if my 
friend Merle comes tonight?&quot;

&quot;It should be fine,&quot; Juri said with a nod.

She opened a door not too far from the library and walked into the 
medium sized sound proofed room. She smiled a bit as she looked 
around, she might have felt she had to install the karaoke machine, 
but at least this way it wasn&#39;t inflicted on everybody else.

As stepped back out into the main room to take another swing around 
the large interior, she saw a light on upstairs, in her business 
office. She took the back stairs up, past the several for rent rooms 
and to her office.

She swung the door open quickly, and saw Tendo Nabiki sitting at 
Juri&#39;s desk, going over her papers with a calculator in hand. &quot;If we 
keep spending money like this, we&#39;ll never be able to make a profit,&quot; 
her accountant complained to Juri sourly.

&quot;Would it surprise you to learn that I&#39;m not in this for the money?&quot; 
Juri asked her with a impish smile on her face, knowing how the young 
lady would react.

Nabiki looked up at her like she was totally insane. &quot;OK, fine, 
whatever you say,&quot; she said, throwing her hands up with a melodramatic 
sigh.

As Juri walked out she added over her shoulder, &quot;Oh, if you try 
selling any more pictures of us from the community showers again, I&#39;ll 
fire you on the spot.&quot;

Nabiki grinned back at her, &quot;Just trying to make some spending money. 
Besides, weren&#39;t you complimented that your pictures went the 
highest?&quot;

Juri quickly decided not to answer that particular question. Instead, 
she went right back downstairs, and returned to her position standing 
guard by the main entrance. Juri took a final look around as she said 
to herself softly, &quot;It looks like we&#39;re all ready to go.&quot;
