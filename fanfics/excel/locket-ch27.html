Keiko climbed up on a ladder, the last set of heart decorations held 
firmly in her hands. She taped them up carefully, then she nodded in 
satisfaction. Hearts and girl-cupids adorned the walls, nearly 
overwhelming with the cuteness.

Juri shook her head, asking Nabiki, &quot;Do we have to go this far?&quot;

&quot;Trust me, Arisugawa,&quot; Nabiki smiled back, &quot;the crowds will love it.&quot;

&quot;Keiko,&quot; she heard someone call her name, and a smile stretched her 
face. She looked down to see May steadying the ladder with a gentle 
smile on her face. She climbed down quickly, catching May&#39;s hand in 
hers.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; Keiko grinned, and kissed her gently. She 
drew back, and May slipped a box of chocolate into Keiko&#39;s breast 
pocket.

&quot;Happy Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; May echoed, and kissed her again.

Ryouko shook her head with a smile, &quot;They&#39;re so cute, aren&#39;t they?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Hitomi smiled. She looked over at Ryouko curiously, &quot;So what 
are you and Ayeka doing tonight?&quot;

With a bit of a blush, and Ryouko said, &quot;We&#39;re taking Ryo-Ohki up to 
Earth orbit for a romantic dinner. How about you and Milerna?&quot;

&quot;Also out to dinner,&quot; Hitomi nodded, &quot;though I&#39;m asking her to please 
leave her knives at home this time.&quot;

&quot;She threatened a waiter again?&quot; Ryouko asked, and Hitomi nodded 
mournfully.

Sakura swayed gently with Tomoyo, dancing closely together in the 
midst of the crowd. Sakura sighed softly, &quot;The Light and Dark are at 
it again.&quot;

Tomoyo looked over at the two Clow cards dancing nearby and had to 
laugh. They just couldn&#39;t keep their hands off each other. &quot;They&#39;re so 
cute, though,&quot; Tomoyo smiled. They danced quietly for a moment, &quot;I 
have your Valentine&#39;s Day present back at home.&quot;

&quot;What did you get me?&quot; Sakura asked eagerly.

&quot;A very special kind of chocolate,&quot; Tomoyo smiled impishly.

Sakura looked a bit nervous. Since becoming Tomoyo&#39;s lover she had 
discovered that along with a wicked sense of humor, Tomoyo was also 
quite... imaginative, in bed. &quot;How special?&quot; she asked her 
suspiciously.

Tomoyo smiled sweetly, whispering in Sakura&#39;s ear, &quot;Edible panties.&quot;

Sakura went beet red.

Keiko noticed the young woman sitting all alone, nursing her non- 
alcoholic drink. Her brown, shoulder length hair reached her 
shoulders, and cutely had a few bits sticking up near the top of her 
head. Her glasses were an older type, but seemed to suit her somehow, 
going with the old fashioned dress she wore.

Taking a menu in hand she went over to serve her when she saw the 
girl&#39;s face light up happily. Hanging back, she saw the girl leap out 
of her chair and into the arms of a taller, dark haired woman in black 
leather.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, Yomiko,&quot; the leather clad woman said softly, cradling 
Yomiko in her arms. The two seemed to fit together, complete only when 
they were together.

&quot;I&#39;m just glad you made it, Nancy-san,&quot; Yomiko said softly. &quot;Happy 
Valentine&#39;s Day,&quot; and a small box of chocolates were handed across to 
Nancy and they both sat down, &quot;Is your detective office ready yet?&quot;

&quot;Just about,&quot; Nancy smiled, &quot;with my talents, it seems the idea sort 
of job.&quot; She looked at the box with a little smile, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Keiko approached them with a cheerful smile on her face, &quot;Welcome to 
Arisugawa&#39;s Locket. What can I get you?&quot;

They ordered their food and drinks, and Keiko hurried away.

Rika swayed in Renamon&#39;s arms, enjoying the pleasure of dancing with 
her love. &quot;I still can&#39;t get used to how calmly people take us here,&quot; 
she sighed softly.

Renamon gave a soft sound of agreement, &quot;I guess they see stranger 
things.&quot; A pause, &quot;Thank you, for the chocolates. We&#39;ll share them, 
later.&quot;

Rika laughed, &quot;I never quite saw the point of handing out chocolate 
when I was younger.&quot; She smiled up at Renamon, &quot;But now I finally 
understand.&quot;

&quot;After meeting you,&quot; Renamon smiled, &quot;I understood a great many 
things.&quot;

A figure bumped into them, and they turned just in time to see the 
little catgirl bow and say, &quot;I&#39;m really sorry!&quot;

&quot;No problem,&quot; Rika started to say, then gaped at the catgirl&#39;s 
companion.

The silver haired woman had eight fox tails, and a impish slant to her 
expression. She, on the other hand, was gazing at Renamon 
thoughtfully. &quot;Sakura,&quot; she introduced herself and bowed, &quot;kyubi fox.&quot;

Renamon bowed her head respectfully, &quot;Renamon, digimon.&quot; She drew Rika 
forward gently and in gentlemanly fashion introduced her, &quot;My lover, 
Rika.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like you to meet my sempai,&quot; Sakura blushed a bit, &quot;Natsuki.&quot;

&quot;Hi!&quot; Natsuki waved cutely, keeping a firm grip on Sakura&#39;s arm.

&quot;So how many secret admirers left you boxes of chocolate this year?&quot; 
Juri asked Haruka curiously. They were standing by the bar watching 
the crowd, while patiently waiting for Michiru and Setsuna to show up.

&quot;Ten or so,&quot; Haruka shrugged. She looked over at Juri with a smile, &quot;I 
noticed someone left a box for Setsuna, too.&quot;

Juri blushed faintly, &quot;Was that a bit too much?&quot;

Haruka smiled, &quot;Setsuna was pleasantly surprised. She&#39;s gotten them 
from students occasionally, but that&#39;s it.&quot;

Juri frowned, &quot;People must be blind.&quot;

&quot;And how many did you get?&quot; Haruka asked pointedly. She paused, &quot;So 
how was your date with Setsuna?&quot;

&quot;A few boxes,&quot; Juri blushed again. &quot;She kissed me,&quot; she admitted.

&quot;And?&quot; Haruka asked eagerly.

&quot;And... none of your business,&quot; Juri said, but she blushed a bit 
brighter. Before Haruka could ask anymore pointed questions, they 
noticed that a young woman was climbing up on to the karaoke stage.

&quot;This is dedicated,&quot; the brown haired girl smiled sadly, &quot;to the one I 
loved.&quot; She pressed the keys to bring up her selection, and a few 
seconds later, the music came on. Her voice was sad, and it&#39;s sorrow 
reached all corners of the Locket, reminding them that love, 
sometimes, wasn&#39;t forever.

&quot;There&#39;s a Victorian tin, I keep my memories in, I found it up in the 
attic, after looking inside I find the things that I&#39;m hiding, The 
leaves saved from a mistletoe kiss, Only nostalgia has me feeling like 
this, Like I miss you, It must be the time of year,

Remember, December, It&#39;s like a winter dream beside a diamond stream, 
Remember, December, The fall of snow and the afterglow. It could be 
taking our breath away, But the years stand in the way. Remember, 
December, How does it make you feel inside?&quot;

She finished, wiping gently at a tear at the corner of her eye. &quot;Tara, 
I miss you,&quot; Willow Rosenberg said softly, so softly the mic. barely 
picked it up. She left the stage silently, then the music system 
started up again.

Aoi and Yoriko sat down at the bar, and Minagi quickly appeared to 
receive their orders. &quot;What can I get you folks?&quot; she asked with a 
grin.

&quot;Wine,&quot; Aoi smiled, and Yoriko seconded that.

&quot;Thank you for the chocolate,&quot; Yoriko said softly. She smiled, &quot;But I 
thought I was supposed to give the chocolate to you.&quot; She produced a 
little box from her coat pocket.

Aoi smiled as she said gently, &quot;I&#39;m not sure the rules really apply to 
us.&quot; She took it from Yoriko and opened it, only to freeze.

&quot;It might be a bit too soon,&quot; Yoriko said softly, &quot;but...&quot;

Aoi gently shushed her, tears glimmering in her eyes. &quot;It&#39;s perfect,&quot; 
she sighed, drawing the golden ring out of the box of chocolates. She 
slipped it on, then threw her arms around Yoriko&#39;s neck, kissing her 
firmly.

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Minagi chuckled, setting the two glasses of wine 
down quietly. &#39;I wonder if I should slip back to see Sasami,&#39; she 
thought with a smile.

Nabiki smiled slightly, watching the teeming crowds. She rather 
enjoyed working at the Locket, even when everyone was pairing off the 
way they were. She and Bones were the sole hold outs from the rush to 
coupledom going on.

She&#39;d rather like to find a partner, but Nabiki really didn&#39;t think 
that it was terribly likely. She raised her drink and smiled to 
herself sadly, then a frown flickered on her face. The red haired girl 
over there didn&#39;t look particularly happy, standing there all alone.

Nabiki sighed softly, pushing off from the wall and making her way 
over. As she neared, she noticed that the red haired girl was quite 
attractive, and generously proportioned. &#39;Wonder if she&#39;s shy?&quot; Nabiki 
thought.

&quot;Would you care to dance?&quot; Nabiki asked her with a smile.

The red head looked at her in surprise, pushing her hair back to look 
at her thoughtfully for a moment, then she smiled, &quot;Sure, why not.&quot;

Nabiki led her gently, directing their movements across the floor, 
&quot;I&#39;m Nabiki Tendo.&quot;

A smile, &quot;Ayeka Kisaragi.&quot;

The redhead looked worriedly between the dark haired, well endowed 
woman on one side of her and the blonde, elegant figure standing at 
the other. &quot;You two aren&#39;t going to start fighting again, are you?&quot; 
Lina asked faintly.

Naga glared at Filla, then she sighed, &quot;All right, for your sake, 
Lina.&quot;

Filla scowled, but finally nodded, too. &quot;Just for this special day,&quot; 
she said.

From behind her back, Naga produced a generously sized box of 
chocolates. Filla, at the same time, produced a box that was identical 
to the first one. Both women looked at the boxes, then they shot 
glares at each other.

&quot;Oh, no,&quot; Lina whimpered.

&quot;Is there anything I can get you?&quot; Excel asked cheerfully.

&quot;Some body bags, maybe,&quot; Lina sighed softly, watching lightning 
dancing in the air between her two suitors.

&quot;I bought those chocolates first,&quot; Filla hissed.

&quot;No, I did,&quot; Naga answered, her voice growing remarkably chilly.

&quot;Let&#39;s go, sempai,&quot; Hyatt grabbed Excel&#39;s arm and tugged her away 
before the fireworks fully started. Fire and ice flew by, and they 
ducked behind a table for safety. The noise went on a few moments, 
then once the fighting stopped they popped up for a peek.

All three young women were looking distinctly singed. Both Naga and 
Filla turned and walked away, leaving Lina standing there with the 
charred boxes of candy.

Lina sniffled softly, &quot;And I wanted to eat the chocolates, too.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Juri heard from behind her. She turned to see Setsuna 
standing there, a little smile on her face. &quot;I loved the chocolates,&quot; 
she murmured, kissing Juri gently on the lips.

&quot;For that,&quot; Juri murmured, &quot;I&#39;d give you all the chocolate in the 
world.&quot;

Setsuna blushed, &quot;Charmer.&quot; She slid her arm into Juri&#39;s even as she 
produced a box of chocolates for Juri, too.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled. She paused, &quot;Would you like to go out with me, 
tonight?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Setsuna smiled sweetly. She paused before asking, &quot;Is this 
going to be another interesting date?&quot;

Juri chuckled, &quot;Any date with you would be interesting.&quot;
