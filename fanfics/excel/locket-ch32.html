Rei Hino shrugged eloquently as she explained, &quot;So they want to get 
married.&quot;

&quot;What, here?&quot; Juri blinked. The last few customers were leaving and 
the staff had started closing up when Rei had flagged her down.

&quot;Belldandy and Linna want me to perform the ceremony, and they want to 
rent the Locket for the night,&quot; Rei smiled.

Juri looked thoughtful, &quot;Would they mind letting the regulars at the 
Locket attend?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think it would be a problem,&quot; Rei said, &quot;I&#39;d have to ask 
them, though. Why?&quot;

&quot;If they agree,&quot; Juri grinned, &quot;I&#39;ll let them have the place for 
half.&quot;

Setsuna was wishing some of the staff goodnight, then she made her way 
to where Rei and Juri were standing. &quot;Ready to go, love?&quot; Setsuna 
asked.

&quot;I&#39;ll go talk to them,&quot; Rei grinned, &quot;have a good night you two.&quot;

Juri and Setsuna walked out of the Locket together, Juri pausing just 
a moment to lock up. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful night,&quot; Juri smiled.

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Setsuna smiled back at her.

&quot;Too beautiful to end too soon,&quot; Juri smiled. She paused, &quot;Would you 
like to stop by my place for a nightcap, maybe?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Setsuna smiled as Juri led her to Juri&#39;s car. She 
helped her in like any gentleman would, and they were off.

The top was down, the breeze ruffling their hair as they drove through 
the heart of Tokyo. &quot;I wanted to invite you over sooner,&quot; Juri 
admitted, &quot;but I had to make sure the place was at least presentable 
first.&quot;

&quot;I doubt it was that bad,&quot; Setsuna chuckled softly.

&quot;Bachelor living,&quot; Juri shrugged. She was just glad she had used one 
of those cleaning coupons May had given her for Christmas.

Setsuna laughed softly. Neon lights glowed around them as they coasted 
to a stop. &quot;You live in the Shinjuku district?&quot; she said, surprised.

&quot;Yeah, I inherited the apartment from my Aunt,&quot; Juri explained. She 
opened a garage with a key, then drove the car in before locking it 
up. She led Setsuna into the apartment building, nodding to a dark 
haired man walking outside, &quot;Hello, Joe.&quot;

Ryo Saeba nodded, &quot;Hey, Juri.&quot;

Once they were out of his hearing, Setsuna murmured softly, &quot;Is that 
Joe Saeba, the infamous City Hunter?&quot;

&quot;You always know more than you let on,&quot; Juri said admiringly. They 
stepped into the elevator, and Juri pressed the top floor button 
twice. The elevator rose smoothly, reaching the top floor but not 
stopping, going one floor above that.

The door opened, and Setsuna stepped out, her eyes wide. &quot;Wow,&quot; she 
murmured softly, looking out over the city. A small house was 
literally perched on the top of the building, a single floor cottage.

Juri unlocked the front door and waved Setsuna inside. The living room 
was comfortable, a pair of sofa chairs and a couch, coffee table, and 
an impressive entertainment system. Two doors branched off, one 
clearly leading into the kitchen.

&quot;Wine?&quot; Juri offered, stepping into the kitchen. At Setsuna&#39;s nod she 
poured two glasses of red, stepping into the living room to sit on the 
couch beside her. Juri picked up a remote and hit a switch, soft music 
playing in the background.

&quot;This rose is our destiny, it has lead us here...&quot; it began, 
continuing on in Japanese.

&quot;This is a beautiful home, Juri,&quot; Setsuna said quietly, looking around 
her admiringly.

&quot;There&#39;s only one problem with it,&quot; Juri said quietly, &quot;it&#39;s a little 
to large for one person. For a couple, it&#39;d be perfect.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s eyes widened as she got her meaning, &quot;Juri, I&#39;m flattered, 
but...&quot;

Juri winced, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She put her drink down and walked over to 
the window, looking out over the city. &quot;Guess I&#39;m rushing things,&quot; she 
said quietly.

A gentle hand rested on Juri&#39;s shoulder and she turned to meet 
Setsuna&#39;s eyes. &quot;You have no idea how much I want to,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;but I have a responsibility to Hotaru and the others.&quot; 
Softly, she said, &quot;You could move in with me.&quot;

They both thought for a moment of Juri moving into the Outers&#39; home. 
Juri had to sigh, &quot;I don&#39;t think that would work out.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Setsuna said quietly.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Juri clasped Setsuna&#39;s hand in her own firmly, &quot;but I 
do know that I&#39;m not giving you up.&quot; She smiled, &quot;We&#39;ll find a way.&quot;

A few hours later in an apartment in another part of the large city, a 
rapid house cleaning was under way that morning.

&quot;Are you sure you want me here?&quot; a busy May asked her softly. The 
beautiful Cyberdoll cleaned up with a relentless energy, scouring the 
place from top to bottom while not messing up her long blue and white 
dress in any way.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;m sure,&quot; Keiko smiled. Her long brown hair was pulled back 
into a long braid, and she wore a simple white shirt and dark pants.

&quot;Does you&#39;re friend Nanami know about me?&quot; May asked curiously.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Keiko took a step towards her, &quot;that&#39;s part of why I 
invited her today.&quot; She took her hand, &quot;Sit down, rest for a minute.&quot;

May looked around and nodded, &quot;The place looks good.&quot; She and Keiko 
sat down on the couch together, &quot;So this Nanami was your best friend 
in school?&quot; May gently rested her head on Keiko&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure Nanami had a best friend, but I was probably the closest 
she came to it,&quot; Keiko admitted. &quot;I was a bit surprised when she 
called yesterday asking to see me,&quot; she added.

May sat up suddenly, &quot;Does she know about you being...?&quot;

&quot;She knows I&#39;m working at the Locket,&quot; Keiko said, &quot;but I haven&#39;t 
specifically told her.&quot;

&quot;I hope she takes it well,&quot; May said thoughtfully, &quot;I mean, she did 
have experience with Juri, Utena and Anthy at your old school.&quot;

Keiko shook her head, &quot;Juri, Utena and Anthy were sort of a law unto 
themselves.&quot;

The doorbell rang, and they both froze. &quot;I&#39;ll get us some snacks,&quot; May 
quickly retreated into the suite&#39;s kitchen.

Keiko took a calming breath, walked over and opened the door. She and 
Nanami both looked at each other a moment, and both had to grin. 
Nanami hesitated, moving to hug her, and Keiko reached out, grasped 
her hand gently and shook it.

Nanami&#39;s golden hair was shoulder length, her clothes much more casual 
than anything she would have worn regularly. She looked Keiko up and 
down, &quot;You look good.&quot;

&quot;So do you,&quot; Keiko grinned.

Keiko led Nanami inside, and the young woman looked around with a 
smile. Nanami&#39;s eyes widened and she exclaimed, &quot;You&#39;re living with 
someone!&quot;

Keiko looked at her in surprise, &quot;How did you know?&quot;

&quot;The way the room&#39;s decorated,&quot; Nanami grinned, &quot;so who is he?&quot;

Keiko simply said, &quot;She, actually.&quot;

Nanami looked at her, a little smile teasing her lips. &quot;I always 
wondered why you didn&#39;t date much in school,&quot; Nanami murmured, &quot;when 
can I meet her?&quot;

May, a mistress of good timing, came out of the kitchen bearing a tray 
of drinks and snacks. &quot;Hello, Mrs. Kiryuu, Keiko&#39;s told me so much 
about you,&quot; May beamed.

&quot;May, meet Nanami, Nanami, meet May,&quot; Keiko smiled.

&quot;Call me Nanami,&quot; she offered her hand to the good looking young woman 
with a smile. &quot;And I hope you can forgive my misdeeds at school,&quot; she 
added with a smile.

&quot;The past is the past,&quot; May shrugged, &quot;I&#39;d rather judge on the now.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Nanami smiled. Softly, &quot;I should have brought Miki with me.&quot;

&quot;You and Miki?&quot; Keiko laughed. &quot;You finally got him at last,&quot; she 
smiled.

They made idle chatter for a few moments, and Keiko was astonished by 
how much Nanami had changed. The hard, almost bitter young woman she 
had been at school was gone, leaving a much more warm, open woman in 
her place.

Finally, Nanami got to the point of her visit. &quot;I&#39;m worried about my 
brother, Touga,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;He was always a casual drinker, 
but he&#39;s become much worse in the past few months,&quot; she sighed softly.

Keiko frowned slightly, &quot;Have you thought about having Saionji talk to 
him?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;ve not talked in years,&quot; Nanami said. Keiko looked at her in 
shock and Nanami nodded, &quot;I couldn&#39;t believe it either.&quot;

&quot;So you think Juri might be able to help,&quot; Keiko said thoughtfully.

&quot;If you could ask her to try, I&#39;d be forever in your debt,&quot; Nanami 
said softly.

&quot;I can&#39;t promise anything,&quot; Keiko cautioned her, &quot;but I&#39;ll try.&quot;
