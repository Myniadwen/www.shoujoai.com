<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 69 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../excel/index.html">Excel Saga</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../excel/locket-ch68.html">Back to Part 68</a><pre>Before Valentines Day

The valentne&#39;s cards were put together quickly, first
the candy was attached, then they were folded in half,
and finally set in the basket to be handed out at the
door. Sitting at the tables around the Locket the
staff assembled them, talking cheerfully, joking and
generally having a good time.

&quot;Whaa!&quot; Excel held her finger as the blonde
complained, &quot;I got a paper cut!&quot;

&quot;Let me,&quot; Hyatt moved languidly, delicately taking
Excel&#39;s finger in her mouth.

Ryouko snickered softly as she saw Excel blush, as it
didn&#39;t happen all that often. She briskly worked away,
smiling faintly as Ayeka worked beside her, the
engagement ring she had give the young woman gleaming.

&quot;Thank you for asking me to help,&quot; Ayeka said with a
soft smile, her dark purple hair flowing down her
back. She was wearing more human clothes today, the
comfortable dress hugging her curves gently.

&quot;I&#39;m always glad to have you,&quot; Ryouko answered with a
grin, her own light blue hair wildly cascading down
her back. She was dressed in her usual jeans and
T-shirt, something she chose for comfort rather than
style.

Ayeka raised a wicked eyebrow, &quot;But you haven&#39;t had me
yet, today.&quot;

Ryouko laughed, gently slapping her arm, &quot;Bad girl!&quot;
Her voice dropped to a sexy purr, &quot; I think that&#39;s why
I like you.&quot;

&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever given out
Valentine&#39;s chocolate before,&quot; Alpha mused, her green
hair tied back neatly from where she worked nearby.

&quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot; Mahoro asked, her black hair flowing
down her back. She smiled faintly, &quot;I find that
surprising, considering.&quot;

Alpha blushed a bit. &quot;I wonder if I should go see
Kokone,&quot; she said thoughtfully, &quot;I haven&#39;t since I
started working here.&quot;

&quot;It could be she&#39;ll end up here,&quot; Mahoro pointed out,
&quot;this is that kind of club.&quot;

&quot;And how about you?&quot; Alpha asked, &quot;Do you have someone
you&#39;re giving chocolate to?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mahoro&#39;s eyes twinkled in amusement, &quot;but I&#39;m
not telling who.&quot;

Over by the bar Cyber Six had a frown on her face.
&quot;All right,&quot; the black haired woman in a simple
leather bodysuit said, &quot;in the western version boys
give chocolate to girls but in the Japanese one the
girls do it?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;d be it,&quot; Minagi agreed, the young woman looking
like Ryouko&#39;s twin except for the twin scars on her
face. She grinned, &quot;Have you decided what you&#39;re
giving Lori yet?&quot;

&quot;There&#39;s a shop with a special box of chocolates, the
Empress Set,&quot; Cyber Six actually blushed faintly, &quot;I&#39;m
getting her that.&quot; She scowled suddenly in anoyance,
&quot;I just hope Junior doesn&#39;t decide to try something.&quot;

&quot;Do you want a few of us to go out to Meridian with
you?&quot; Minagi offered as she finished up folding
another Valentine on top of the bar, &quot;I bet that we
could shut him down for good, if we&#39;re just a little
lucky.&quot;

&quot;Thanks for the offer,&quot; Cyber Six smiled slightly as
she said, &quot;but this is personal. I want to handle it
by myself.&quot;

&quot;Somehow I just knew you were going to say that,&quot;
Minagi said with some amusement, moving to check the
stock in the bar.

Nabiki Tendo snored away faintly, her face on her arms
as she sat at one of the tables. Hitomi looked at her
curiously then shook her lightly, &quot;Nabiki-san?&quot;

&quot;Ahh,&quot; Nabiki jerked as she came awake, the black
haired young woman blinking in confusion. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she
shook her head to clear it.

&quot;Had a rough night?&quot; Hitomi asked, the brown haired
younger woman&#39;s eyes twinkling with gentle amusement.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Nabiki stretched, &quot;Ayaka and I were
celebrating her getting a medium contract with a old
Japanese company and we kind of overdid it.&quot;

&quot;I thought Ayaka had decided to quit being a medium?&quot;
Hitomi asked as she went back to her sweeping,
cleaning up around the bar smoothly.

&quot;She did for awhile, but she wasn&#39;t happy,&quot; Nabiki
said simply. She frowned, &quot;Not that I won&#39;t be worried
about her, but...&quot;

&quot;She needs to do what she&#39;s good at,&quot; Hitomi nodded.
She smiled slightly, &quot;Milerna is like that, too.. she
had no intention of giving up being an adventurer.&quot;

&quot;And you wouldn&#39;t want her any other way,&quot; Nabiki
grinned, &quot;me, too.&quot;

May laughed softly as she and Keiko sorted books in
the library, putting things back in their proper
order. &quot;How,&quot; May held up a well read trade paperback,
&quot;did someone manage to put Pat Califia under the
s-es?&quot;

&quot;Misspelled the last name?&quot; Keiko suggested, filing a
new batch of Bella novels into the shelves. &quot;Has Juri
decided on if we should file the erotica seperately?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s undecided,&quot; May shrugged. long brown hair
cascading over the shoulders of her red and white
maid&#39;s uniform. A smile, &quot;There&#39;s a lot of novels that
are borderline, so we&#39;d have to make a lot of
judgement calls over where to file them.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Keiko found herself blushing faintly as they
put up the latest editions of &#39;Best Lesbiam Erotica.&#39;
Her brown braid bounced as the boyish young woman got
up and added, &quot;Did you hear about Yomiko&#39;s suggestion
that we set up a lending library?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that bad of an idea,&quot; May noted, &quot;but with
the crosstime aspect of the bar we&#39;d have a hard time
making sure the books got back.&quot; She got up from where
she had been kneeling and stretched, feeling a flash
of pleasure at how Keiko still noticed her figure.

&quot;Should we,&quot; Keiko croaked, blushig, then cleared her
suddenly tight throat. &quot;Should we move on to the next
section?&quot; she asked in a more normal tone of voice.

May took her hand, squeezing gently, &quot;Sure.&quot;

Over in the kitchen Sasami surpervised her cleaning
crew, including Shampoo and Ukyo. &quot;Thank you very much
for agreeing to do part time,&quot; the light blue haired
girl bowed to the two older ones, &quot;it&#39;s nice to take
days off.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure Sugar,&quot; Ukyo grinned, her long hair
flowig over her shoulders, &quot;the pay is good and I
figure with everything I&#39;m learning from you, it&#39;s a
bonus.&quot;

&quot;Shampoo like Sasami&#39;s cooking,&quot; she admitted with
just a bit more reluctance. She suddenly grinned, long
purple hair bouncing like her breasts, &quot;And Shampoo
get to spend time alone with Ukyo, too.&quot;

Ukyo blushed.

Out in the bar Arisugawa Juri smiled as she headed
downstairs, having finally finished up all her
paperwork. It was one of the few banes of her
existence, dealing with all the stuff the government
needed done, as well as helping to ballance the books.
It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t trust Nabiki, but she wanted
to keep her hand in.

&#39;Now, what do I get Setsuna this year?&#39; Juri wondered.
Part of her wanted to buy her a ring, to declare their
commitment to the world.. but she was nervous, too.
&#39;You&#39;ve been living together for a while now,&#39; she
reminded herself, &#39;what&#39;s there to be afraid of?&#39;

&quot;Hey Juri,&quot; Ryouko waved.

&quot;Yo,&quot; Juri waved, going by the small table towards the
main bar. She nodded to Cyber Six, &quot;So what do you
think of being our bouncer?&quot;

Cyber Six looked at her curiously a moment but smiled,
&quot;I&#39;m enjoying it, actually. I&#39;ve only had to throw one
customer out, and most of the guys trying to bust in
are lightweights.&quot;

&quot;Who did you have to throw out?&quot; Juri blinked,
obviously having missed that.

&quot;The vampiress Drusilla,&quot; Cyber Six shrugged as she
explained, &quot;she tried to bite someone and they called
for help.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m tempted to ban vampires,&quot; Juri made a face, &quot;but
that would mean we&#39;d loose Saya, Miyu and the others.&quot;
She got back on topic, &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re liking it,
it&#39;s going to be hectic on Valentine&#39;s day and we&#39;ll
need your help.&quot;

Cyber Six saluted with a grin, &quot;Will do.&quot;

&quot;And bring Lori by too,&quot; Juri added with a smile, &quot;I
bet she&#39;d love to see you.&quot;
