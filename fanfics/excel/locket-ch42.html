Juri stuck her head out the pantry door, then she looked back in at 
Washu to say, &quot;There&#39;s actually a few more out there, now.&quot;

Washu sighed softly as both she and Yume worked feverishly on the 
faintly glowing device that was sticking up out of the pantry&#39;s floor. 
&quot;The Dimensional Tuner will be fixed as soon as we possibly can,&quot; the 
child-like genius explained to Juri patiently, &quot;so why don&#39;t you go 
out and deal with your guests?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s easy for you to say,&quot; Juri sighed as she left them to their 
work, &quot;you weren&#39;t dealing with that mob last night. And now this!&quot;

&quot;Any luck?&quot; the waiting Setsuna asked her with a gentle smile. 

&quot;Soon, she says,&quot; Juri shrugged.

Setsuna looked over at the mob filling the Locket and smiled wryly. 
&quot;This is going to be an interesting evening, then,&quot; she remarked.

All along the long bar, covering the dance floor and sitting down at 
the dining tables were various incarnations of Arisugawa Juri herself. 
Her, and all the young ladies across the multiple dimensions who were 
her romantic partners.

&quot;I suppose that you don&#39;t serve whole blood here, do you?&quot; the bone 
pale skinned version of Juri asked Ryouko coolly.

&quot;Actually, we do,&quot; Ryouko kept a careful eye on the vampire as she 
drew a bottle of blood from the fridge, &quot;what would you like mixed 
with it?&quot;

Utena put her hand on Juri&#39;s shoulder, her blue eyes narrowed on her 
pale face. &quot;Have you seen Anthy anywhere?&quot; the vampire asked.

&quot;Haven&#39;t seen her,&quot; Juri&#39;s gaze seemed to linger on Utena&#39;s face.

A bit of a blush appeared on Utena&#39;s cheeks, &quot;I&#39;d better go look for 
her.&quot; Utena moved off into the crowds, and Juri watched her go 
silently.

Juri watched the crowd with an odd expression on her face, leaning up 
against one of the bookcases in the library. &quot;This place is 
incredible,&quot; the woman who was garbed in black from head to toe 
murmured to herself softly.

&quot;Juri-san?&quot; the dignified voice came from just behind her. Juri turned 
around to see Releena smiling up at her gently, the woman that some 
called the Queen of the World looking at her with such caring in her 
eyes.

&quot;Is everything all right, Releena-sama?&quot; Juri asked her, reaching up 
to nervously adjust her flight suit&#39;s high collar.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to call me that, you know,&quot; Releena murmured, her own 
military style uniform colored a soft pink. She gently put her hand on 
Juri&#39;s arm, &quot;I don&#39;t think anyone will mind a bit of informality, you 
know.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Juri smiled wryly, &quot;but I think you&#39;ve earned it.&quot;

&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Releena sighed sadly.

Juri hated to see the regal beauty looking so very sad. &quot;Is there 
anything I can do, Releena?&quot; she asked her Queen softly.

Releena took a deep breath, &quot;Would you dance with me?&quot;

Juri concealed her deep surprise, instead gallantly offering the 
shorter woman her arm. Together they moved out onto the dance floor, 
and Juri gently cradled Releena close, letting the smaller girl relax 
against her.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Releena sighed happily.

&quot;It&#39;s my pleasure,&quot; Juri answered.

Over at the bar Juri gave Minagi a smile as the bartender passed her a 
drink. &quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri was blushing faintly at the odd costume she was 
wearing.

&quot;Nice outfit,&quot; Minagi grinned at her. Juri was wearing an 
approximation of Ryouko&#39;s costume, her long mane of orange hair spiked 
up to mimic Ryouko&#39;s mane.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Juri smiled wryly. She tossed a look at the real Ryouko and 
shook her head slightly, &quot;I never expected to meet the real thing, 
though.&quot;

&quot;I think I like you better, though,&quot; Utena remarked as she settled 
into a seat beside her, dressed in a costume based on Tenchi&#39;s usual 
garb.

The real Ryouko snickered at that, &quot;Gee, thanks.&quot;

Utena shrugged as she took Juri&#39;s hand, &quot;Sorry, but it&#39;s true.&quot;

Juri raised their linked hands, gently kissing the blushing Utena&#39;s 
hand.

Sonomi lead Juri across the dance floor, enjoying how responsive she 
was. Her younger lover liked to lead, too, both in and out of bed, 
something that Sonomi was learning to enjoy. &quot;This must be one of the 
more unusual bars we&#39;ve visited,&quot; she smiled.

Juri laughed softly, &quot;An understatement, I think.&quot; The lead shifted 
fluidly, and Juri guided them across the floor as she added, &quot;I wonder 
how this could be possible.&quot;

&quot;Magic,&quot; Sonomi answered her simply, &quot;or some technology so very 
advanced that it seems like magic.&quot;

Juri smiled to herself wryly, thinking of the Clow cards that Sakura 
had worked so hard to capture in Ohtori. &#39;Now that&#39;s real magic,&#39; she 
mused. Aloud she asked her, &quot;So where did Sakura and Tomoyo head off 
to?&quot;

Sonomi smirked, &quot;Upstairs, I think.&quot;

Juri sweatdropped. &quot;Let&#39;s hope that Tomoyo didn&#39;t bring her video 
camera along with them,&quot; she muttered to Sonomi.

&quot;Actually,&quot; and Sonomi had the oddest look on her face, &quot;I think she 
did.&quot;

&quot;Juri-sama!&quot; the happy voice squealed, and Juri was glomped.

The taller woman helped Wakaba slide around, then she held the brown 
haired girl close to her. &quot;I was getting worried about you,&quot; Juri 
scolded gently.

Wakaba just beamed, &quot;I got us our drinks before looking around a bit.&quot; 
She took Juri to a table, where they sat down together.

Keiko looked at the two of them with a wry smile, pushing her brown 
braid back. &quot;Is there anything you&#39;d like to order?&quot; the suit clad 
young woman asked.

&quot;Could we share a sundae?&quot; Wakaba asked cheerfully.

&quot;Why not,&quot; Juri grinned back at her.

&quot;What ever is going on,&quot; Shiori smiled up at Juri from where they 
swayed together on the dance floor, &quot;it isn&#39;t magical in nature.&quot;

Juri raised her eyebrow, being careful not to accidentally jab someone 
with her sword&#39;s hilt, &quot;Then how can there be so many of... me, here?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Shiori shrugged up at the swordswoman, &quot;that I can&#39;t tell 
you.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s enjoy it while it lasts,&quot; Juri dipped the startled girl 
and kissed her.

&quot;Whoops,&quot; Shiori gasped, then laughed as she snuggled close to her 
Juri.

Setsuna and Juri sat side by side at the bar, watching the general 
madness unfold. &quot;I don&#39;t suppose,&quot; Juri looked over at Setsuna, &quot;you 
couldn&#39;t just turn into Sailor Pluto, wave your Time Staff and send 
them all home?&quot;

Setsuna shook her head, &quot;I could try, but there&#39;d be no guarantee I 
could return them all to their correct alternate realities.&quot; She 
smiled slightly, &quot;And I don&#39;t want to think about what might happen if 
a Juri landed in the wrong world.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got a point,&quot; Juri admitted.

Another group of young women came in and Setsuna&#39;s eyes grew wide. 
&quot;Oh, my..&quot; she murmured softly, trying very hard not to laugh out 
loud.

Sailor Juri, Sailor Shiori, Sailor Utena, and Sailor Anthy all looked 
around them in awe, each dressed up in their full sailor senshi 
uniforms. &quot;Such an interesting place, Utena-sama,&quot; Sailor Anthy beamed 
happily.

&quot;I need a beer,&quot; Sailor Juri sighed.

&quot;Sailor Juri-sama, you look so cool!&quot; Sailor Shiori gushed.

Everybody sweatdropped...
