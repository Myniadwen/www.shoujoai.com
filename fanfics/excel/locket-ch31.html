Nabiki gave Juri a nod, a impish smile on her face. &quot;About time you 
got back,&quot; she smirked.

Juri couldn&#39;t help it, she blushed slightly. &quot;A lady can&#39;t go see her 
girlfriend occasionally?&quot; she smiled. She paused, &quot;I understand you&#39;re 
going to have that problem, too.&quot;

Nabiki looked away, &quot;Guess you&#39;ve heard about Ayeka Kisaragi.&quot; She 
smiled slightly, thinking about the stunning redhead that she had been 
seeing.

&quot;Glad to see you&#39;re dating finally,&quot; Juri said gently. She paused and 
looked around the bar, &quot;So are you going to introduce her to the 
family?&quot;

Nabiki blushed, &quot;Let me get our first official date over with first.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going out on a date?&quot; Juri grinned.

Nabiki sighed.

Standing outside, Bones gave Rally a look, extending an arm to block 
her way. &quot;You know one of the regulars?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I was invited by Misty,&quot; Rally said cautiously.

Bones nodded, &quot;Come on in.&quot; As Rally passed her she added, &quot;And you 
can leave your pistol at the bar, please.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s good,&#39; Rally thought even as she gave her a nod.

Hitomi smiled at her cheerfully, &quot;Welcome to the Locket!&quot; The woman 
didn&#39;t respond, looking around her nervously. &#39;A first timer,&#39; Hitomi 
noted.

The place was packed, wall to wall with people, and all of them were 
pretty women. Rally forced her way towards the bar, politely as 
possible moving through the mob. She broke through to the bar itself, 
and had to fight to conceal her surprised reaction. The bartenders 
were twins, both having long blue hair and cat-like eyes. The only 
difference she could see was the crescent shaped scars on one woman&#39;s 
face.

&quot;What can I get you?&quot; Minagi said cheerfully.

&quot;Scotch,&quot; Rally said simply, then reached into her jacket to draw out 
her pistol. &quot;I understand I&#39;m to leave this here?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ryouko took the pistol from her gently, &quot;we&#39;ll treat it with 
respect.&quot; She handled it carefully, placing it behind the bar.

Rally picked up her drink, then turned to scan the crowd for Misty. 
There were tables set up near a small library, and she spotted the 
brown haired girl looking about nervously. She spotted Rally and 
smiled, waving gently.

Rally skirted the busy dance floor while walking over to Misty&#39;s 
table, but she was stopped by a hand resting on her arm.

&quot;Are you here with someone?&quot; the brown haired beauty asked her with a 
smile.

&quot;Sorry, but yes,&quot; Rally nodded nervously towards Misty.

The woman looked over at Misty with a frown on her aristocratic face, 
&quot;A bit scruffy, isn&#39;t she?&quot; She gently pressed something into Rally&#39;s 
hand and said, &quot;If you want something a bit more classy, look me up.&quot;

As the woman walked away, Rally unrolled the note she had pressed into 
her hand. &quot;Une&quot; it read simply, a number after it. Rally blushed 
fiercely, cramming the note into her pocket and hoping against hope 
that Misty hadn&#39;t seen. No such luck, of course.

&quot;Looks like you made a conquest,&quot; Misty smirked at Rally.

Lady Une made her way over to her friends table, slipping into her 
seat. Noin and Releena were looking at her inquisitively, while 
Dorothy calmly sipped her drink. &quot;Any luck?&quot; Dorothy asked her with a 
little smile.

&quot;You were right,&quot; Lady Une admitted, reaching over to put her hand on 
her lover&#39;s.

Releena was looking over at Dorothy in disbelief. &quot;You two do this 
sort of thing often?&quot; she asked disbelievingly.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Dorothy calmly sipped her drink, a impish smile on her 
face.

&quot;What would you have done if she said yes?&quot; Noin asked, sitting close 
by Releena.

&quot;Invited her over,&quot; Lady Une smirked.

&quot;Hi there,&quot; May smiled at them cheerfully, &quot;is there anything I can 
get you?&quot; They ordered a refill, and the pretty brown haired android 
bounced off.

&quot;Looks like Keiko is making her happy,&quot; Releena chuckled softly.

&quot;Releena,&quot; Noin pretended to be shocked. The song, &#39;White Reflection&#39; 
started up in the background, and Noin smiled slightly. The tall, slim 
soldier got up out of her chair, offering Releena her hand, &quot;Shall 
we?&quot;

As Releena took it the twin gold bands they wore glittered in the dim 
light, her long braid swinging as Noin pulled her to her feet, &quot;I&#39;d 
love to.&quot; They made their way out to the dance floor together, swaying 
gently to the music.

&quot;They make a lovely couple, don&#39;t they?&quot; Dorothy smiled, watching them 
dance.

&quot;That they do,&quot; Lady Une agreed, gently drawing Dorothy&#39;s hand to her 
lips, kissing it gently. She smiled slightly, &quot;Would you like to get a 
room tonight?&quot;

Dorothy smiled, her eyes hooded slightly, &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;

Mahoro bounced by the table, then noticed the pair at another table. 
&quot;Anything I can get you?&quot; the dark haired android asked a startled 
Rally and Misty.

Misty smiled up at Mahoro, &quot;Are you working here regularly now?&quot;

&quot;Part time,&quot; Mahoro said cheerfully.
