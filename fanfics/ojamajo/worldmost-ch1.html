<pre>{Onpu&#39;s feelings of who she love most}:

Friends.

What are friends?

Friends are special, kind, funny, and are fun to play with.

Everyone except one friend, that means more than anything in the whole 
world.

That friend of mine is Doremi-chan.

Why Doremi-chan? Simple. We had been friends for a very long time. 

I met her ever since I was eight at school. We didn&#39;t know each other 
at first, but then, we were familiar with each other and became the 
best of friends. Throughout mu life, we did so many things for each 
other. Aww! Those memories. Whenever I feel sad, you do something 
special to make me laugh. Whenever I feel blue and lonely, you were 
always there for me, standing by my side. Whenever I sense trouble 
coming after me, you came for me, for my protection and saftey.

Yes, we had been friends for a long time. For the most part, I spend 
alone with you often. Then, I had this funny and unusual feeling 
around you. Then, I saw it! I see it with my eyes. It was love at 
first sight. The more I kept being friends with you, the closer we are 
near to each other. Then, I saw the light, revealing why I had this 
funny feeling. This feeling was...so strong, I just...felt this 
unimaginable experience. I fantazied you Doremi-chan, together in 
arms. I confess my love to you, face to face, alone. I always had deep 
feelings about you and me together. You didn&#39;t believe me at first, 
but then I kissed you ppassionately. Feeling the warmth inside of you, 
your inner fire and beauty. The feeling of you, holding arms together. 
I had waited patiently for this moment and I dreamed of it, 
visualizing if it was really happening in my presence.

Doremi-chan, you mean a lot to me. You were always my best friend. You 
were always my one true love. The one I desire most. If love was at 
first sight, it would take two boats to get across it. I know it will 
happen and I&#39;ll never forget that. As always Doremi-chan, you&#39;ll be in 
my heart forever. {blows a kiss.}

{Doremi&#39;s feelings of who she love most}:

Friends.

You&#39;ll be the best friend I ever have. I want a friend who is so 
unique, so charming and yet, so special that I have someone in the 
place of my heart. A friend who I care about most throughout my whole 
life. And...that friend would have to be you Onpu-chan.

Why Onpu-chan? Simple. It&#39;s so...hard to explain, but I will tell. 

I remember the very first day, way back in the day, when I heard 
someone was new to my school. I didn&#39;t know who it was, until...I met 
her. I&#39;ve met the most handsome looking girl like no other. Oh, how I 
love her purple shiny hair. I love her beautiful skin, and how I love 
her heavenly voice. The only thing was that, she was so shy and quiet 
looking. My classmates didn&#39;t really fit well in meeting her.

We didn&#39;t knew each other when we first met. As time went by, I took 
the urge of making friends with her by talking, and soon we got along 
well. Together, we became the best of friends and as our relationship 
grew, we get to know each other as well. We did so many things in the 
past, so much to share.

Whenever you feel sad, I was there for you and I did something special 
to make you laugh. Whenever you&#39;re alone to yourself, I was there for 
you, by your side. Whenever you sense danger coming at you, I was 
there for you, protecting you from harm. Preventing anyone to come 
near you to hurt a friend I care more than anything else.

I have always been the best of friends with you, onpu-chan. The things 
I do for you is the things you do just for me. But that&#39;s not all. The 
more you kept being friends with me, the more our relationship got 
closer. I didn&#39;t know anything about this, until I had this strange 
feeling about you. I kept thinking to myself...why? Why is our 
friendship getting deeper at the moment? Why? Why does she keep 
following me whenever I go? Is it so hard to ask? Why is it that I 
can&#39;t get her out of my head? These questions are just too hard to ask 
for myself. Then, it hit me. I realized and figured out that Onpu-chan 
is attractive to me. It feels weird to see someone fall in love of the 
same gender, and it does feel unconfortable. But...is onpu-chan in 
love with me?

These answers weren&#39;t real enough. But one day, I had saw the light! I 
just had this strange fantasy about Onpu and me alone. Together, we 
were in arms in this calm, so peaceful, quiet place. Then, Onpu-chan 
confessed everything about me and how she loved me so much. I couldn&#39;t 
refuse it. I mean, I was so confused about this if it was for real 
than imaging. I didn&#39;t know what to say, until...you kiss me. I was 
suprised by the kiss. I didn&#39;t know why, but that kiss...it felt good, 
so relaxing, that...I loved it.

As I felt your kiss, it fills me up with warmth. The smell of sweet 
breath from you fills my nostrials. It symbolizes everything that we 
did for each other. Of all the good times we had, and the hard times 
we faced, I still remember that, to this day. Every single moment and 
every single detail that I wanted you even more. All of a sudden, we 
became together like one. United as one! As we joined together as a 
couple to show the world that nothing can stop us from being in love 
with each other. Nothing will. I will never let anything from stopping 
me from having this girl of my dreams. That&#39;s why I only wanted you. 
You mean everything to me. You mean so much to me that I could never 
lose you in my sight. Never to lose that smile of yours when you see 
me. I&#39;ll never let that happen. I know your trying to understand what 
I&#39;m saying all this, and this is why I&#39;m saying this to you.

Oh Onpu-chan, you mean everything, just about everything to me. 
Everything I want throughout my whole life. We didn&#39;t know each other 
until now. We have so many memories, even as apprentice witches. We 
spent most of our times there. We were even alone for ourselves and 
how I want to hold you in my arms. With you and me, together as one, 
nothing can&#39;t break the spell of love, just for you and me only. 
Without you, I will be nothing. And still to this day, you will be in 
my treasured, sacred, heart Onpu-chan. Always. I will never forget 
this. Never. And you will always be in my heart forever.
