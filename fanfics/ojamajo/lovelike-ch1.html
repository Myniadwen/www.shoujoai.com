<h1>Love Like This</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ojamajo/index.html">Ojamajo Doremi</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ph.html">PH</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Aiko, you mean so much to me. You mean everything to me. So much, that,
I can&#39;t live without you. I want to be with someone, who will always be
in my heart. Someone to stay in touch with me forever.

Ai-chan, I know this may sound suprising to you. The truth is, &quot;I Love
You.&quot; I just don&#39;t know why I said this. But in my own heart, my mind,
my soul and my strength, I really mean it. 

Maybe you didn&#39;t realize that I&#39;m in love with you, or didn&#39;t suspect
it. But one day, when you and I are alone together, face to face, I will
confess all my feelings towards you, and only you. No matter what
emotion and feelings I put towards you, I will make you mine. No matter
how much words I go deep on you, you will learn, and you will
understand, of all my love towards you.

Oh Ai-chan, I can never stop thinking about you. The feeling of you and
me together, would be an everlasting moment. You and me, as one. The
desire of having you in my arms, would become a part of me. I wanted you
badly. The emotion of you, protecting me from evil of what I see, is
what I like about you. I needed you. You&#39;re so strong, so brave, no one
can do it better than you Ai-chan. That&#39;s what I like about you. Even
though you look like a boy, you still have a feminine side of you. I
don&#39;t want anyone else but you. You are the prize, my desire, my
everything. You are the one who would be mine. I believe in myself of
having you and me, as one. You are my protector, my light. All those
stories I&#39;ve been writing about you and me in romantic adventures, will
all reflect on you Ai-chan. I need you...for real.

Trust me Ai-chan. One day, it will happen. I will make my dreams come
true. I will have you as my lover for life. I don&#39;t care about anyone
else, nor I don&#39;t care what they&#39;ll say about me, having you, as my
lover. Everything I&#39;ve been through, will come true, and no one is going
to break that barrier of the one that I love. My love is for you Ai-
chan. Yes you. You are my focus. All my memories, feelings, emotions,
and my big love will all be on you. I&#39;ll never forget that. Never forget
those words that I&#39;ll say about you. It&#39;s all about a game of love, and
that love will be coming after you.</pre>
