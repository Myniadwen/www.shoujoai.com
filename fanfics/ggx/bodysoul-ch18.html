<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 18 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>An eerie chill went down Ky&#146;s spine as his final step placed him at 
his destination. Or...that which seemed to be his destination. In 
front of him was the steel bolted door to an extremely tall tower, 
just outside the town of Fuzhou. Ky took a second look at the 
tournament invitation he had been given just a few hours ago. This 
whole situation seemed so...unusual.   

Ky had left Jam&#146;s place a few hours ago. But before he left, a strange 
man appeared before him. The strident man donned very unusual clothes 
of someone in China. A monocle over his eye, a living cape and a pipe 
in the corner of his mouth...but what bothered Ky was the latent 
strength he felt within that man. Ky really could not explain it 
but...he felt a power inside of that mysterious man that was near 
overwhelming. He offered Ky an odd invite to a fighting tournament at 
an arena in the clear grasslands outside of Fuzhou. Ky was at a loss 
to explain why he had been given this invite, but deep down a part of 
his noble soul wanted a test for his skills. 

A suitable test before his inevitable confrontation with Sol.   

That was part of the reason why Ky was so adamant about competing in 
this tournament. If his fighting skills were to keep their razor edge, 
then the French knight had to find a worthwhile challenge. 

But then as Ky looked at this elevated tower, it seemed nothing like 
he had pictured it in his mind. The place was...dark in a fairly 
simplistic term. Thick cracks streamed across the walls, climbing up 
to the higher levels of the tower. Dark grey clouds filled the night 
sky, streaks of lightning crackling with a thunderous beat. 

That however, was not the thing that bothered Ky. What bothered him 
was that this place did not look anything like a fighting arena. It 
seemed...barren. Then Ky got the feeling that this whole thing could 
have been an elaborate trick. A fool&#146;s idea of a good joke. 

{I do not believe...} Ky started. {That I was foolish enough to trust 
a total stranger about a tournament...}

The shame of being tricked by someone with such a bad sense of humor 
struck into Ky. This was a waste of his time. But as he turned to 
leave abruptly, the steel doors barricading the tower&#146;s entrance 
slowly opened up. 

&#147;What?&#148; 

The movement of the loud metal doors came to an end, and Ky looked 
over his shoulder at them. The doors were around eight feet tall and 
around fifteen inches thick, but inexplicably they were open. Ky 
peered inside. Within the tower was a large hall, more or less empty, 
devoid of literally anything, but at the far corner was a large 
stairway. And as Ky looked up to see where it led, his crystal blue 
eyes widened at the sheer magnitude of their height. These stairs 
seemed to climb up for a long distance, maybe even to the top of the 
tower. Ky stepped in the hall to better inspect this place. 

Something just didn&#146;t feel right about any of this. Why was this large 
building empty? Why did the doors open when no one seemed to be in 
here? It was his conspicuous sense of curiosity that kept Ky within 
this tower. He was going to get to the bottom of all of this. Ky&#146;s 
eyes scanned the hall for any shred of life, but nothing appeared 
before him whatsoever. 

{Somebody must be inside this tower.} Ky thought. {I will find out who 
this person is...} 

With a quick tightening of his grip on the mighty Thunderseal blade, 
Ky walked over to the flight of stairs at the other side of the room 
and began the journey upwards. Kliff&#146;s successor climbed flights upon 
flights of stairs, slowly inching his way to the top at a snail&#146;s 
pace. The spiralling stairs just seemed to go on and on forever, like 
a stairway to heaven or something...

Ky sighed as the staircase ascended to new levels again and again, but 
breathed a sigh of relief when he realized that his efforts were 
reaching a well-received conclusion. Around a half an hour later, the 
staircase finally reached a new room. Ky stepped into the room 
breathing a sigh of relief, and his blue eyes scanned this room over.

Like the grand hall below, there was nothing of any noteworthy 
significance to mull over. But Ky did see a second flight of stairs 
that when straight up. Ky was incensed by the idea of making a second 
pitch up the spirals of this tower, but then realized something.

{This feels...familiar somehow...I feel like...I&#146;ve been here 
before...something about this whole situation seems...}

Ky cut off his own thoughts when he looked up. There was a flat 
ceiling to the room that showed the tower was at its final epoch. 
Feeling that a finale would be reached soon, Ky rushed over to the 
stairs and climbed up. Before long Ky ascended to a whole new room 
that was nothing the previous one. Unlike the previous rooms, this was 
the last area to the tower. It was open, no walls or ceiling, the 
clouds screaming out with lightning and cool night air filling Ky&#146;s 
nostrils as he stood. However Ky&#146;s anxiety over this whole situation 
was not unfounded...his thoughts became more urgent as he looked 
around this place. 

Marble-like rubble beleaguered the dusty floor. A blood red carpet was 
draped over a hundred-step stairs leading to two broken gates. Gears 
were encased like ice within the surrounding area...the most 
noticeable of all was the body of a young woman, brandishing a pair of 
wings...

Ky was hit with the deepest feeling of reminiscence seeing this whole 
setting. This was all just like...

The knight gasped. &#147;Oh my God...&#148;

Ky&#146;s diamond blue eyes widened his pure shock as he took a better look 
at those two broken gates. Standing before them...was someone that was 
supposed to have died nearly a whole year ago...

Shock bled through Ky&#146;s bones. &#147;...It is not...possible...&#148;

The back of the Gear King was turned, but he knew full well who had 
just arrived. His senses were as sharp as ever. &#147;Salutations, young 
knight.&#148;

Ky was still frozen by astonishment. &#147;...J-Justice...? It cannot 
be...he is...&#148;

&#147;Dead?&#148; Justice filled in. &#147;But yet, here I stand before you. On a 
grand stage laid out by another. I must say they have done an 
excellent job. Everything seems to be as it was one year ago. What 
nostalgia I feel.&#148;

Ky&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;You cannot be alive.&#148;

Justice&#146;s head peered over his shoulder to inspect Ky, his young 
incarcerator. &#147;Your eyes...they still reflect the woes and malignant 
joys of the battle. But...not the truth it seems. Do you realize that 
this is the forth time we have faced each other in battle?&#148;

Justice chuckled darkly. &#147;Your tenacity is almost as splendid as that 
of your master&#146;s. It is strange. The Crusades seem so long ago. Things 
were simple back then, were they not? Battling each other relentlessly 
was so simple. We spilt each other&#146;s blood and felt the passion and 
bliss that emanated from such feverish combat. And yet...times have 
changed greatly. The concentration is on life not fighting. Combat is 
straightforward...it is living that is difficult. Perhaps that was why 
the Crusades lasted so long. Mankind seems to be comfortable within 
the battlefield. To take a step in the dark and love one and other is 
too hazardous for them. So maybe that was why they revived me. As a 
bringer of what human nature desires most. Absolute destruction.&#148;

Ky was angered. Pretender or not, this creature infuriated Ky just as 
much as Justice had done one year ago. &#147;What are you babbling about?! 
I will hear no more of this!&#148;

Again, Justice laughed and looked away. &#147;You see. Your anger gives 
rise to an extremely quick desire to take up arms against me. Even 
when it is more than obvious that the scenario is playing out in the 
exact way someone desires it to be.&#148;

Ky&#146;s muscles trembled. This *was* Justice. Ky didn&#146;t even realize that 
he had raised the Thunderseal in his hand. The Gear commander always 
had the frightening power of omniscient perception. 

Ky lowered the Thunderseal a little. &#147;What do you mean...playing out?&#148;

&#147;That is irrelevant.&#148; Justice crossed his arms. &#147;Regardless of the 
reason...I exist once again. My duty must be fulfilled.&#148;

This was Justice all right. Nobody else had that blatant streak of 
annihilation in their system. &#147;Your duty?!&#148; Ky bellowed rhetorically. 
&#147;The destruction of humankind?! You are just as insane as you were one 
year ago! How can the obliteration of an entire race be so casually 
accepted by anyone with any real sense of obligation?!&#148;

A calm wind blew through the stairway to heaven. &#147;You still do not 
understand. I do not wish to crush humanity. Only the dark path that 
lies before them. You realize how much of a danger I am to your kind, 
don&#146;t you? Yet humans used prohibited technology to author my 
unexpected revival. Is that the act of a deserving race? A race that 
will secure the future of the earth?&#148;

&#147;...I...&#148; Ky was at a loss of words to counter that statement. If 
someone took that perspective, it would be no surprise that Justice 
would follow this path. But Ky could not accept that. Mankind may have 
free will, but it had the choice to exorcise it in a righteous way. It 
was humanity&#146;s decision to direct itself towards God&#146;s path. 

Ky constricted Thunderseal with his vice grip. &#147;I will not allow you 
to enforce your own personal brand of justice on the world! You have 
no right to disarm the autonomy of human desire!&#148;

&#147;Is it not humans that currently control the earth? How am I at fault 
when your breed rips this world apart day by day? I am doing nothing 
more than what your kind created me for. What is your excuse?&#148;

The wielder of the Thunderseal scowled at Justice&#146;s words. &#147;Excuse?&#148;

&#147;Do not feign puzzlement. You know exactly what I speak of. Look at 
the history of your kind. It is written in blood. The tears you shed 
on the battlefield may show your guilt...but they cannot justify, 
compensate or amend your crimes. The only thing that will protect the 
interests of this planet are the deaths of the ones who enslave it. I 
am a weapon that was designed to kill humans, and so I do. My 
assignment is the purification of humanity. I only follow that 
command. That is the true essence of my existence.&#148;

Ky could not believe what he was hearing. &#147;Damn you, Justice! You are 
not God!&#148;

Justice&#146;s arms untangled his arms and his powerful eyes cast over his 
human enemy once again. &#147;Enough. Satisfy your blind hatred. Strike me 
down. We shall see which of us is more deserving. Only the winner will 
ever know the truth.&#148;

&#147;What?! Dizzy&#146;s been kidnapped?&#148;

June gasped, shocked by what she had just learned from Johnny and May. 	
She was upstairs at the time, but it seemed that Justice, or some 
clever pretender who looked like him, burst through the walls of the 
Inn she and the others were staying at. He knocked May and Johnny away 
as if they were nothing at all, and stole Dizzy. Now she was missing, 
and there was no trace of her.

Johnny sighed. He and June were setting nervously at the couch in the 
lower room. The glaring hole made by the King of Gears was dented into 
the wall. It was shocking, to see the raw brutality and strength that 
a Gear could muster. It gave Johnny sullen memories of the Crusades. 
Luckily, he was able to keep the majority his crew from experiencing 
the true horror of the Crusades. But now...that bloody war could be 
re-ignited with vengeance. Johnny was not confused though. The world 
had only sustained peace for around six years. Even Johnny was not 
optimistic enough to have believed that the current peace could have 
lasted. But...he could not help but feel disheartened. If Justice was 
alive...that meant that even more innocent lives would be lost...and 
more guiltless children would be orphaned as a result.

{That bastard.} Johnny thought sternly. {I swear he won&#146;t get away 
with this. I won&#146;t stand back and watch like I did six years ago.}

June took note of the stern look on Johnny&#146;s face. The cook of the May 
ship could see that Johnny was holding back a lot of anger. 

&#147;Johnny...&#148; June was cautious in addressing him. &#147;Are you okay?&#148;

Johnny closed his eyes. &#147;Don&#146;t worry about me, June. Go check on May. 
I think she is really broken up about Dizzy&#146;s capture.&#148;

June scolded herself. {Oh no! I forgot about May!} 

June was just about to ask the captain of the May ship about May&#146;s 
whereabouts, but he seemed to pick up on her thoughts and saved her 
the trouble of asking. He pointed to the gigantic hole made in the 
wall. Outside was May, standing solitarily on the street, surrounded 
by the wreckage of Justice&#146;s wrath. Quickly the cook stood up, and 
walked over to check on her friend. June was seriously worried about 
May&#146;s reaction to all of this. Even May herself didn&#146;t realize how 
much she cared about Dizzy. If anybody made a comment about Dizzy that 
was in the least bit derogatory, May would be down there necks like a 
lightning bolt. May was very protective of Dizzy and now...

June stepped through the massive tear in the wall, and walked up to 
May. The cook had a concerned look on her face. May was shivering. But 
not from the cold. 

&#147;May?&#148; June tried to make contact. May would say nothing. 

June tried again, putting a sympathetic hand on May&#146;s shoulder. 
&#147;Are...you...how are you doing?&#148;

May managed to speak, but her voice was breaking. &#147;I...couldn&#146;t 
protect her...&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t blame yourself for this, May. It&#146;s not your fault. You-&#147;

May scowled and tugged her arm back from June&#146;s touch. &#147;Yes it is! 
That was the whole reason I came on this trip to China! To look after 
Dizzy, and I couldn&#146;t even do that! Now she&#146;s out there with some sick 
maniac and I can&#146;t do anything about it...she should be here...with 
me...its all my fault!&#148;     

The anchor girl fell onto her knees, weeping and sobbing into her 
gloved hands. June felt her own eyes tearing up from seeing this. May 
was always so strong and brave. But here she was, crying. It was scary 
to say enough. June had always relied on May&#146;s confidence and strength 
for support. 

&#147;May...&#148; June stressed. She had to be May&#146;s strength now. &#147;...This 
isn&#146;t your fault...stop talking like its over. We can find Dizzy if we 
keep it together.&#148;

May shifted outside her own feelings of despair to recognise that. 
June was correct. Dizzy wasn&#146;t gone. No way. Not unless they gave up 
on her. She had to keep it together...there was no other way. The 
pirate girl rubbed her marble eyes free of her tears, and stood up off 
the ground. 

May managed to turn around and face June. &#147;You...you&#146;re right. 
Thanks...June.&#148;

June said nothing as she pulled May into a hug. The Jellyfish Pirates 
were a family, and a family look out for each other. That was the 
beauty of the love that friends share. They will go out of their way 
to console one of their own. 

Johnny walked up to the hole Justice had created and stared at a teary 
eyed May.

{Don&#146;t worry, May.} Johnny thought. {We&#146;ll get Dizzy back.}

**********

Baiken gritted her teeth as her eye slowly opened up, and focused on 
her surroundings. The last thing she remembered was her unfruitful 
charge on Justice. That battle was a complete write-off. Never before 
had Baiken actually felt such a significant gap between her power and 
the power of another. She was out of her league. And that thought was 
the one that tore apart Baiken&#146;s heart. All of the time and suffering 
it took to master her powers, to learn the way of the sword. And in 
the end it all amounted to nothing. What was it all worth, if she 
could not avenge her people? 

In her lament, Baiken tried to ignore the pain in her body to mumble a 
few words. &#147;I...should have...died alongside my people...&#148;

&#147;Well now, I wouldn&#146;t have said that, sis!&#148;

Baiken&#146;s eye shot open at the sound of that voice... &#147;Anji Mito?&#148;

The Japanese colonist smiled and took a seat next to Baiken on the 
chair next to her bed. &#147;Hey. Look what happens to you when you&#146;re out 
of my protection for so long.&#148;

Baiken grimaced, as tough as that was to do. &#147;What are you doing 
here?!&#148;

Anji smiled generously. &#147;Where ever there is a trace of That Man, 
there I shall be. I can sense his hand in all this. Can&#146;t you?&#148;

&#147;This is none of your...arrgh!&#148; Baiken yelled in pain as she tried to 
heave herself off the bed. The Japanese woman collapsed back when the 
pain overpowered her. 

&#147;You better not try moving for a little while.&#148; Anji said concernedly. 
&#147;A lot was taken out of you. You might worsen the injuries you have if 
you try to put strain on them.&#148;

Baiken groaned a little as she lay down. Everything was going haywire. 
First Justice rears his ugly head even though he should have died a 
year ago, now Anji appears out of nowhere. Nothing about this 
situation made any sense. 

Baiken looked at Anji. &#147;Where...am I?&#148;

&#147;This is a small house I rented. I was actually just passing through 
Fuzhou to get to Mainland China. I&#146;m looking for someone. But then I 
heard about an explosion in the city, so I left to investigate the 
situation. Then I ran into you and your friend.&#148;

&#147;My friend...?&#148; Baiken&#146;s memory was fuzzy. &#147;You mean, Millia...?&#148;

Anji nodded. &#147;I think that&#146;s what her name is. Anyways, she was 
hesitant to let me near you, but I explained that I knew you, and she 
allowed me to take you back to my place to recover.&#148;

Baiken looked around. &#147;Where is she?&#148; 

Anji just shrugged. &#147;I don&#146;t really know. My guess is she went after 
Justice. She seemed pretty angry.&#148;

{Damn! Millia can&#146;t fight him alone!} Baiken struggled to pull herself 
up from the bed. Her injuries were too painful to overcome, but she 
had to help Millia. In an instant, Anji stood up to prevent Baiken 
from leaving. 

&#147;You&#146;re in no condition to be fighting right now, Baiken. It would be 
better for that girl if you weren&#146;t there. If you go, that would be 
another thing for her to worry about.&#148;

Baiken hated to admit this, but Anji was right. If she did go there, 
Millia would be at a disadvantage. She hoped that Millia wouldn&#146;t do 
anything rash though. Despite how powerful she was, Millia had very 
little faith or respect for her own power. 

The ultimate paradox of Millia&#146;s situation was that her powers were 
designed to kill. Yet Millia did not have the heart to follow a life 
of murder. Baiken could accurately predict Millia&#146;s future. It 
wouldn&#146;t end happily unless Baiken could do something for her. 

Baiken leaned back onto the bed. &#147;I...suppose you are...correct.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, Baiken.&#148; Anji said confidently. &#147;I think your friend is 
strong enough to take care of herself.&#148;

**********

This was it. The time for talk had passed.

Feeling that time was right to strike, Ky charged up the hundred steps 
leading up to the gates to heaven. And the leader of the Gears. Ky 
darted towards Justice, who himself had full notice of Ky&#146;s power. 
Human or not, Ky was extremely gifted. 

As Ky reached Justice&#146;s proximity, the valiant knight leapt into the 
air, soaring above the hundred steps. Justice looked up at Ky. He had 
no idea what this boy was going to do. But Ky answered that question 
himself.

The blue-eyed officer crossed his arms over his body, closed his eyes 
and focused his attention on the Thunderseal blade. All of Ky&#146;s focus 
empowered the blade in his hands, streaks of sapphire lightning 
passing along its finely crafted edge. Seeing that the time was ripe 
to strike at his enemy, Ky spread his arms out evenly, and a crescent 
shaped wave of compressed lightning shot down at Justice&#146;s direction. 

Type 01 smiled at this attack. In his battles with Ky he had come to 
be very familiar with this sort of technique. The Gear King scurried 
to one side of the wave, and Ky&#146;s attack easily carved into the 
carpeted steps of one hundred. Justice avoided it so easily that he 
began to question Ky&#146;s abilities on the battlefield. Until he looked 
up to see that Ky was no longer airborne. 

Justice was confused, and looked around for any trace of the sacred 
knight. But his questions were answered when Justice looked below his 
current field of sight. Ky skated along the ground with his long left 
leg branched out, and struck Justice&#146;s knees. Justice staggered 
forwards, caught off guard by Ky&#146;s strategy, and was thrown back as Ky 
made a lightning tinted slash at his legs. That was the one that got 
to Justice. He stumbled backwards, and toppled to the ground, his 
massive weight too much to sustain balance. 

Ky covered his face as a wave of dust clouded up from Justice&#146;s 
descent, but he did not let that get in the way. Again, Ky launched 
himself into the air, and centred his mind&#146;s eye on the fallen 
Justice. This time the Stun Edge would be for real. 

Ky crossed his arms across his body again, concentrating his power 
into the Thunderseal, then branched out his arms accordingly. The 
motion produced a second wave of thunderous, hemispherical shaped 
energy that smashed into Justice, shocking his body with the latent 
power of the sky. 

Satisfied with the outcome, Ky landed from the air and maintained his 
fighting position. Slowly the electrified dust around Justice died 
down, to reveal his magnificently designed Gear body getting back onto 
its feet. Justice stood up and formed a curious chuckle of approval.

&#147;Brilliant strategy.&#148; Justice said. &#147;But you didn&#146;t actually expect 
that level of attack to finish me, did you?&#148;

Ky smiled also, not dropping his guard. &#147;No. If things were that 
simple, the Crusades would not have lasted so long. You cannot fool 
me, Justice.&#148;

Ky then gave Justice no time to respond as he charged at the Gear. 
Justice would probably have another way of countering a third 
projectile, so Ky chose to meet his Gear enemy face to face. Ky 
expertly swung his sword at Justice&#146;s chest area, whereas Justice 
thrust his claw sharply at Ky. Thunderseal and Justice&#146;s claw clashed 
with epic proportions, sparks of static electricity splaying around 
them.    

Justice pressed hard on Ky&#146;s sword. He was finding the challenge of 
this man to be more serious than he first realized. With his blade in 
a fierce power lock with Justice&#146;s claw, Ky forced more pressure via 
his wrists. But the more he tried, the more he realized that he was 
gaining no ground. In fact, Ky felt his feet sliding backwards slowly 
from Justice&#146;s awesome strength. 

&#147;Argh...&#148; Ky tried desperately to hold back Justice&#146;s claw, but it was 
not working in the manner he expected. In a desperate bid to prevent 
Justice from landing a blow, Ky crudely shoved Thunderseal forwards, 
and dashed backwards to escape an impending blow. The black talon of 
Type 01 thrust into the ground with fierce force, a force that Ky 
counted himself lucky to escape. 

But Justice gave Ky no time to gather his bearings, and drew back his 
arms to the left of his body. In a powerful motion, Justice swung his 
arms around his techno-biological body, giving birth to a circular 
blast of curvaceous blue energy. Ky was totally unprepared for such a 
method, and breathed out a gasp of shock and pain, as the wrath of 
Justice&#146;s Michael Sword attacked cracked into Ky&#146;s body. 

The young Frenchman was thrown back by Justice&#146;s attack, crashing into 
fragmented pieces of rubble dotted along and around the stairway to 
heaven. Ky gritted his teeth as the demolished stone scraped along his 
back. Still, Justice rushed towards Ky, drew back his fist and 
prepared to strike. Ky&#146;s sky blue eyes widened at the incoming attack 
and he desperately rolled away to avoid it. Justice&#146;s dark fist came 
crashing into the rock that Ky had been knocked into, and upon impact 
the rock shattered into thousands of shards of chipped rock. 

Ky recklessly rolled along the steps, just barely escaping the 
authority of Justice&#146;s fist. Something had to be done soon, or Justice 
would claim dominance over him. Ky steeled himself for a new attack. 
The former leader of the Sacred Order clamped down on the hilt of his 
Thunderseal sword, and jumped into the air. Ky swung his magnificent 
blade around his body as he somersaulted at Justice, a sequential 
trail of lightning coloured blades. The sharp edge of the Thunderseal 
came screaming towards Justice&#146;s head, but that did not intimidate the 
King of Gears. As the blade descended, Justice bolted to one side in 
order to avoid it, and Ky&#146;s attack slashed into the ground, creating a 
wave of static shock in its wake.

Ky growled at the failure of his newly crafted Greed Sever. However 
Justice was not as ashamed of its performance. Justice could tell that 
Ky had been improving his skills since their last battle. For such 
commitment, Justice would gladly show Ky a first-rate portion of his 
power. 

Justice glided towards Ky, letting out a cool laugh of appreciation 
for this fight, then brutally back flipped, spinning his gigantic body 
backwards. The force of his tail slicing through the air caused an 
electric chain of static to blast up into the air, and Ky yelled out 
in with pain as the static flare jolted and propelled his unprepared 
body into the air. This was the perfect set up for one of Justice&#146;s 
new attack abilities. Justice swerved his body to the side, and 
projected a small, slow travelling ball of golden light. The ball 
leisurely travelled over to a now falling Ky, and Justice smiled as Ky 
body came into contact with the Nitro Bomb. 

A huge explosion boomed around the ears of Ky, explosive fire searing 
his body and charring his uniform. Ky collided with the dusty ground, 
particles of that dust filling his senses. Then in a blinding flash of 
truth, Ky remembered just how powerful Justice really was. During the 
Crusades he was ranked as the most powerful fighter ever. And now Ky 
was trying to defeat him on his own. But he could not give up. No way. 
Justice took no notice of the hardening of Ky&#146;s resolve, and the 
hubcaps on the back of Justice&#146;s shoulders reversed backwards. They 
charged up with energy and provided enough force to push Justice off 
the ground. Like magic, Justice flew through the air and projected 
himself foot first at Ky&#146;s grounded torso. But Ky was aware of that. 
Screaming a yell of momentum, Ky thrust himself into the air, swinging 
the Thunderseal over his head, creating a trail of thick, powerful 
lightning energy. Justice was unaware of such a response to his 
movements, and crudely defended himself with both arms. It was enough 
to put some space between Ky and Justice, as the force of the 
collision knocked both fighters back. 

Ky&#146;s feet slid to a stop, and he realized the truth. Justice was far 
too powerful. Unless he did something soon, Ky would die. Ky then shot 
out another blast of crescent shaped energy that cut through the air. 
However Justice was well prepared for this, and crossed his arms 
mockingly, bringing his tail over his head. The Stun Edge bounced off 
Justice&#146;s tail, and reflected back at Ky using a lethal accuracy. Ky 
was shocked. He hadn&#146;t seen an evasion of that skill in years. To 
nullify his own attack, Ky fired another wave of thunder energy that 
crushed his previous blast. A flash of lighting streaked along the 
ground and the air, emulating the bolts of lightning crackling in the 
skies above. 

Now Ky was worried. Justice seemed to be even more powerful then 
before. Something had to be done. Something extreme. Ky stood still 
for a moment, letting his senses fall out of focus. For a brief 
moment, let all of his anxieties go. He remembered the things Kliff 
had told him about concentration and attentiveness. That was the key 
to obtaining immeasurable power. Ky let these memories envelop him, 
and unbeknownst to Ky, streaks of ferocious thunder energy snaked 
along the floor, signalling the severity of Ky&#146;s resolve. Even Justice 
saw this for what it was, and prepared of something big. 

As the maelstrom of momentum reached its peak, a perfectly clear 
sphere of crystal-like lightning energy instantly surrounded Ky. This 
sphere was delimited by four other globular shaped energy balls, and 
Ky yelled out &#145;Ride The Lightning!&#146; as he was propelled forwards at 
The King of Gears. 

Justice was shocked at the amount of power that Ky could muster in 
such a short period of time, and covered himself as Ky&#146;s thunderous 
barrier of energy pressed against his defences.  Ky held nothing back 
from Justice, enforcing all of his strength and power into this one 
last attack. And Type 01 growled in fury as the chest plate of his 
armour-like body was chipped under the sheer force of Ky&#146;s power. 

Now he was actually angry. Justice had been driven to anger by this 
human. Nothing could push Justice away from that scathing thought. The 
human would pay for this...as Ky&#146;s ultimate attack continued to drill 
into Justice; the hubcaps over his shoulders opened up and gathered 
energy. The Gear had qualms about using this much power when he really 
did not need to, but the insolence of Ky scraped at his mind. The 
energy in these compartments gathered up quickly, and as it reached 
its peak, Justice let loose a blast of utter devastation. Ky screamed 
in torture as the force of Justice&#146;s supremacy made itself known. Ky 
was blown back like nothing at all and Type 01&#146;s beam cut through the 
knight&#146;s spherical barrier with ease. As the energy dissipated, Ky 
tumbled down the hundred steps, and came to rest in an awkward pile. 
The blonde man groaned and wrapped his hands around his waist. From 
the feeling, it seemed like Ky had broken a rib. Then he looked up the 
stairway to heaven, and saw Justice standing there once again, with 
that condescending laugh. 

Ky coughed. &#147;...J-Justice...&#148;     

**********

Johnny sighed. Things didn&#146;t seem right about any of this. The good 
captain was leaning on the inner wall of the wrecked Inn. The owner 
and the other people living there had all scampered away for fear of 
their lives. It was understandable. A disaster like this would 
frighten anyone. Thankfully, Johnny had become accustomed to this 
level of destruction. May and June were sitting at the couch across 
from Johnny. May was in a bit of a state, but June was there to cheer 
her up. That was the key thing about this situation. To support each 
other and stay calm. If they acted irrationally, Dizzy would be put in 
even more danger. 

June looked over at Johnny. He was deep in thought, but a plan had to 
be drawn out, and quickly. &#147;Johnny...?&#148;

The blonde man looked up. &#147;Okay, guys. I&#146;ve thought about this. This 
is what we need to do. We are going to search for Dizzy. High and low, 
it doesn&#146;t matter how long it takes, we&#146;re gonna find her.&#148;

June nodded. &#147;Yeah. Lets get started.&#148;

&#147;No, June.&#148; Johnny said firmly. &#147;It&#146;s gonna be me and May who search 
for her. You&#146;re going back to the ship.&#148;

June looked shocked. &#147;But...I can help. I wanna help.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sure you can. But sweetie, you can&#146;t fight. Wherever Dizzy is, 
she&#146;s likely to be with Justice. If you come with us, you&#146;re bound to 
get hurt. I don&#146;t want anymore harm to come to any of my crew.&#148;

&#147;But Johnny-&#147;

June was cut off by a stern look from May. &#147;Johnny&#146;s right, June. It&#146;s 
better if you go back to the ship. Anyway, someone needs to tell April 
and the crew about this situation. We&#146;ll be okay.&#148;

She understood the message but June still looked at Johnny of 
conformation. The look that Johnny threw back was all she needed. 

The shoulders of the cook slouched in defeat. &#147;Okay. I&#146;ll go back to 
the ship and tell the others.&#148;

Johnny made a grunt of approval. &#147;Good. Now...the only problem is, 
where do we begin the search...Justice can&#146;t have gone too far. They 
have to at least be near Fuzhou.&#148;

&#147;I think I can help with that!&#148; Johnny, June and May all looked over 
to the left as a cheerful male voice called out to them from the 
savage hole Justice had blown into the wall.   

And Johnny was surprised at who he was seeing. &#147;Axl?&#148;

The happy British Bulldog tapped his dual kusari-game on his shoulder 
and smiled at Johnny and his crew. &#147;From the looks of things, I&#146;d say 
you&#146;ve had a pretty big party! Any unexpected guests?&#148;

Johnny adjusted his shades. &#147;You wouldn&#146;t believe me if I told you. 
What are you doing here?&#148;

&#147;Well...&#148; Axl started. &#147;I have a few things to iron out. Lets just say 
it&#146;s a debt I own to someone in the near future. I&#146;ve come to tell you 
the location of the girl you&#146;re looking for.&#148;

May was the first to address this. &#147;You know where Dizzy is?&#148;

Axl nodded. &#147;Uh huh. Everyone could use a helping hand every now and 
again. That girl is at a large tower in the southern grasslands 
outside of just outside Fuzhou. It should take you about a hour to get 
there by foot.&#148;

The flame of hope within May&#146;s heart just got that little bit 
stronger. &#147;That&#146;s where she is? Thanks, mister!&#148;

&#147;No problem. Like I said it&#146;s a debt I owe to someone. Just make sure 
you get there as soon as you can. Ciao!&#148;

Just as Axl turned to leave the Inn, Johnny called out to him. &#147;Hey, 
Axl! I find it strange that you&#146;re this willing to help us. What&#146;s 
your real angle?&#148;

Axl shook his head. &#147;I haven&#146;t got one, my friend. Just make sure you 
find the girl. More things depend on her then you realize...&#148;

With that last mysterious statement, Axl disappeared into the deserted 
night streets of Fuzhou. And the three pirates were left with a 
renewed faith in recovering Dizzy from Justice&#146;s clutches. 

Johnny smiled at the two girls. &#147;You ready? Lets go.&#148;

**********

Ky struggled to keep himself on his feet, using Thunderseal for 
leverage. His knees were shaking and faint droplets of blood were 
speckled across his Holy Order uniform. Ky could not believe it. 
Despite all the improvements that he had made to his technique, Ky was 
still being beaten. Even more shocking was the fact that Justice was 
even more powerful than he had been one year ago. His strength was 
incredible. And Ky had to admit...he would have held a deeper respect 
for that power if Justice were not such a monster. 

The King of Gears looked down upon his fallen adversary. A worthy 
match. Ky seemed to have developed somewhat since their last battle, 
but the young man was still no match for Justice&#146;s raw Gear strength. 

&#147;Your skills have increased, young knight.&#148; Justice said respectfully 
to Ky. &#147;I see you have not let your powers wither away with time. It 
is a respectable accomplishment.&#148;

Ky wiped the trail of blood from the side of his mouth. &#147;Don&#146;t 
patronize me!&#148;

Justice crossed his arms arrogantly, much to the annoyance of his 
human rival. &#147;It is as I said all those years ago. Humanity possesses 
techniques that are far greater in potential for fighting than Gears 
do. That is the strength of your kind. Kudos.&#148;

&#147;Silence!&#148; Ky screamed, barely able to hold himself up. &#147;I...will not 
allow you...to sacrifice my fellow man for your...sick ambition.&#148;

This was it. Do or die for Ky. After a massive strain of effort, Ky 
somehow managed to stand up on his own two feet. Ky gathered up the 
last bit of energy he had left in his body, and prepared his final 
attack on the King of Gears.

&#147;S-Stun...E...uhhh.&#148;

Justice looked at a weakened Ky. That was it. That was his limit. With 
a sad groan of tire and fatigue, Ky&#146;s destabilized body slowly toppled 
onto the ground. Ky hit the ground with a loud grumble, dust blowing 
along the floor from the pressure. And slowly...ever so slowly, the 
ex-knight turned police officer faded into an unfathomable 
unconsciousness. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      

&#147;Where...am I?&#148;

Ky looked around...he seemed to be within an endless void. Nothing but 
drifting space and dust. But then, just as it seemed like Ky was the 
only existence within this strange universe, and dark shadowy figure 
appeared before him. 

Ky was shocked. Not at the indistinct man specifically, but because 
this man possessed a striking resemblance to himself...

A darker version of Ky smiled at his counterpart evilly. {Greetings, 
brother.}

&#147;Who...or what,&#148; More correctly, &#147;Are you!?&#148;

{Is it not obvious? Face the pool of life and see the reflection it 
casts. The reflection is of you. And I am a paralleled depiction of 
that reflection.}

Ky was still confused. &#147;You are I?&#148;

The darker Ky nodded. {Yes. In a way. We are similar...but different. 
As different as the night is from the day. We are twin souls, you and 
I. You feel what I feel and I see what you see. A somewhat shared 
subsistence.}   

&#147;I have no idea of what you speak of. But I need to defeat Justice! 
The current peace depends on it!&#148;

Dark Ky chuckled. {Even though you know you cannot win?} 

&#147;That will be for God to decide!&#148; Ky said sharply. &#147;His wishes are 
those that move the earth. I will not stand by and let a Gear defile 
the desires of God!&#148;

{...You think Gears are evil?} Dark Ky asked.

&#147;With beings like Justice stalking the land once again, can you hold 
me to scorn for my feelings?&#148;

Dark Ky shook his head. {You have learned nothing, have you? A machine 
is only as useful as the person that creates it. A weapon is only as 
destructive as the one who wields it. Tell me, what does that say 
about us?}

Ky was again being angered by such talk. &#147;What are you talking about? 
I follow God&#146;s path! The correct path!&#148;

{God...God?} Dark Ky seethed with a cocky smile. {Come now, Ky! Your 
God is nothing more than a fictional apparition. The culmination of 
centuries of disillusionment and fear...}

&#147;That&#146;s enough! Blasphemous heathen!&#148; Now that did it, with unbridled 
anger, Ky slashed at his dark double with Thunderseal. But before Ky&#146;s 
blade could even get near him, Dark Ky&#146;s body dematerialised and 
reformed to avoid the attack. 

{Fool!} Dark Ky bellowed. {Accept reality. Your beliefs and ideals are 
only a safety net. A meaningless tool designed by humanity to trick 
them into believing they have some significant importance over life 
itself. You know as well as I do that the ideas of God and religion 
serve only human desires. The bloodshed and wars fought by humanity 
show that human will is drawn to destruction. The only reason we 
fought the Gears so fiercely was because humanity finally met an enemy 
that could transcend our own power.}

&#147;...T-that&#146;s not...true...&#148;

{Do not walk away from the truth. Accept it. Accept the actualities 
that it gives to your heart. The Gears are the creation of us humans, 
Ky. Yet you blame *them* for the state that the world is. If you 
cannot see the erroneous nature of that, then you are either 
incredibly pathetic or foolishly ignorant. You call violence and crime 
disgusting yet you are prepared to slay thousands of living beings for 
benefit of your own race. Tell me; is that God&#146;s word? Killing one 
group of people is okay because they do not follow His will?}

&#147;...&#148; Ky could say nothing.

However Dark Ky would not let up. {Everything you&#146;ve ever believed in 
is a lie, my brother. An enormous lie tossed to and devoured by the 
blind cattle of humanity. You consider yourself to be a brave crusader 
do you not? But in truth...you are just a delusional child fed from 
birth with the deceitful lies of your own people.} 

&#147;How dare you make a mockery of everything that I hold dear?! Are you 
telling me that the protection of my people is wrong? That it is 
unjustified? You are as twisted as Justice is!&#148; Ky&#146;s tone was strict, 
but his resolve was faltering.   

{Maybe not...but is your perception of justice and truth universal? Or 
does it apply to humanity alone? You can ponder that, as we flow 
deeper and deeper into the darkness...}  

&#147;No!&#148;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      

Justice kneeled down to pick up an unconscious Ky. The King of Gears 
gripped Ky by the collar of his uniform, and observed the young 
knight. His face was contorted in anger and terror. Justice brooded 
over his adversary&#146;s thoughts. It was always a fascinating experience 
to delve into the human mind. The depth that existed within the skull 
of a human was unparalleled.

&#147;Goodbye, young knight.&#148; Justice brought up his claw to finish off Ky 
once and for all. Until a commanding and gruff voice called out to the 
God of Destruction.

&#147;That&#146;s enough.&#148;

Justice chuckled, looking over that the figure across from him. His 
arms were crossed and a chain of fire blustered around his body, 
whipping his ponytail of chestnut brown hair up into the air. With no 
further use for him, Justice tossed Ky&#146;s inert body to one side. The 
battle of one year ago...was coming back to life. 

&#147;So...&#148; Justice said tranquilly. &#147;We meet again...Corrupted Flame...&#148;
