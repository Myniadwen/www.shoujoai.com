<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 14 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>A few hours after April and May had their little chat about the Dizzy 
situation, the May ship landed upon the soil once again. This time in 
the beautiful and majestic country known to all as China. Fuzhou, 
China to be precise. It was for one reason and one reason alone, to 
value and cash in the gold that Johnny, April and May had stolen in 
Berlin just a few months prior to today. Johnny, June and May were the 
ones who were going to go this time though. For once April didn&#146;t have 
to come along, so she thanked Johnny for this break with a deep 
gratitude. Johnny himself was really excited about this; it was all he 
could imagine since he had never spent that much time in China. It 
would be interesting to what the women would be like there... *_~

June was excited as heck, and was eager to visit the new restaurant 
that everyone in the eastern world was going crazy for. Dizzy 
was...slightly reluctant. The last time she got out and about, it 
wasn&#146;t a happy time. Nevertheless, Dizzy put that apprehension to one 
side so she could focus on supporting the gang. May however, had 
hidden agendas for coming all today. On the outside, she was here to 
protect and reassure Dizzy, and while that was still true, May also 
wanted a chance to talk to blue haired beauty without any sort of 
interruptions or interference. Something always seemed to get in the 
way when May tried to make her move, but not this time. If May had her 
way, she&#146;d have Dizzy all to herself for a couple hours. But before 
that, there was a more pressing issue. June and Dizzy. The two of them 
had really been getting close lately. So much so that May wondered if 
there was more to it then just simple friendship. Even May didn&#146;t know 
that Dizzy liked to cook; it was something they had never talked 
about. Yet June had managed to pull it out of her. That annoyed May. 
It seriously did. *She* was supposed to be the one that Dizzy relied 
on. Why was it that Dizzy was running from her, yet releasing intimate 
details of herself to someone she barely knew? How could Dizzy just 
avoid her and then open up to June like that? From these questions 
(that seemed unanswerable) May started to draw firm conclusions that 
explained the situation.  

Something was going on between June and Dizzy. 

The more May thought about it, the more it made sense. And the more it 
irritated May. April had said something to her before that really 
stuck with the sky flyin&#146; brunette. April asked if she was...jealous 
of Dizzy and June. May tried desperately to block that comment out of 
her head, but the more she tried the more it stuck. May had to admit 
the closeness between Dizzy and June was bothering her. Much more than 
it should have done, rationally speaking.

May went over these thoughts again and again as she lay down her 
surprisingly comfortable bed, in a small Inn deep in the heart of 
downtown Fuzhou. The rest of the gang had stayed on the ship, and they 
dropped off Johnny, May, Dizzy and June outside of the city. The four 
then made their way into the Fuzhou and located a nice little Inn to 
rest at. It was cheap, but still very elegant. Maybe the people in 
China were just naturally cheaper than the ones in Spain. May looked 
over her side to the nightstand beside the bed. For some reason, the 
pirate girl had brought along the love rose. May had no real reason to 
explain why she took with her, she just did it. Yet as May distantly 
stared at the white petal rose, she felt even more doubt in herself. 
She was still confused as to whom she should give this rose to. Why? 
It should be simple, right? Give the rose to Johnny. But for some 
strange reason...May could bring herself to do that. And *why* it was 
so hard was still a mystery to her. But whatever happened on this 
trip, it didn&#146;t matter, all that mattered was that somehow, May might 
be able to get back on good terms with Dizzy.

May giggled childishly and a faint blush popped up on her cheeks. She 
remembered the first time Dizzy had noodles. The way she ate them 
looked so cute. And then, out came this beautiful laugh...

Dizzy really was a phenomenal girl; May just hoped that this amazing 
girl wasn&#146;t lost to her. 

Feeling a loud grumble in her stomach, May decided to get something 
eat. She knew that Dizzy, Johnny and June were downstairs, but May had 
felt a bit tired so she took a quick nap to rejuvenate herself. But 
when she got upstairs she realized that she couldn&#146;t sleep at all. 
Funny how things are at times. Heaving herself of the bed in one 
motion, May yawned out and made her way out the door. May walked along 
the hallway and over to the staircase, then went down them. As she 
walked downstairs she could instantly hear the sound of...music, 
ringing in her ears. Old music too. Something that might have existed 
in the 21st Century, or something. May came to the downstairs hallway 
and could see the receptionist was staring at something in the 
recreation room. 

{Must have something to do with the old music} May though.  

Deciding that she had to know what was going on in there, May walked 
into the large room to see a number of people crowding around a small 
stage in the corner of the room. Two of which were Dizzy and June. 
Instantly May felt like going over there seeing what the two were up 
to, but then the pirate girl&#146;s attention was drawn to the stage as she 
saw who was on it. 

It was Johnny, and he looked like he was attempting what appeared to 
be...Karaoke? 

Holding a microphone in one hand, and being cheered on by Dizzy and 
June to his right, the captain of the May ship began his trip to 
stardom...

&#147;I think I&#146;m cute! I know I&#146;m sexy! I&#146;ve got the looks...that drives 
the girls wild!&#148;

Johnny&#146;s feet started tapping as he got into the beat. 

&#147;I got the moves...that really move&#146;um! I send chills...up and down 
their spine! I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!) 

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!)

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!) 

The music took a stronger beat as Johnny continued, &#147;I make &#145;um hot! I 
make &#145;um shiver! Their knees get weak...whenever I&#146;m around!&#148;

&#147;They see me walk, they hear me talk! I make &#145;um feel...like there on 
cloud nine! I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148;(Boy Toy!)

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!) 

The backbeat got even deeper as Johnny sung out his soul to the 
rooftops. &#147;Eat your heart out girls! Hands off the merchandise!&#148;

As the music in the background went into a free verse, Johnny tossed a 
rose to a cute Chinese woman besides Dizzy.  

&#147;I think I&#146;m cute! I know I&#146;m sexy! I&#146;ve got the looks...that drives 
the girls wild! I got the moves...that really move&#146;um!  I send 
chills...up and down their spine!&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!) 
 
&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!)

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!) 

&#147;I make &#145;um hot! I make &#145;um shiver! Their knees get weak...whenever 
I&#146;m around! They see me walk, they hear me talk! I make &#145;um 
feel...like there on cloud nine!&#148;  

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!)

&#147;I&#146;m just a sexy boy!&#148; (Sexy Boy!)

&#147;I&#146;m not your boy toy!&#148; (Boy Toy!) 

&#147;Eat your heart out girls! Hands off the merchandise!&#148;
 
The chivalrous pirate got a standing ovation (Mostly from women) as 
the music in the background died down. Dizzy clapped cheerfully with a 
bright smile on her face, and June just could stop laughing. Johnny 
took a bow and gracefully leapt of stage, handing the microphone over 
to another budding superstar. 

May sweatdropped. She had never seen Johnny do anything like *that* 
before. Still, there was a first time for everything. Johnny walked 
over to a smiling Dizzy and a cracked-up June. 

Johnny winked. &#147;So how was it, girls?&#148;

&#147;That was great, Mr Johnny!&#148; Dizzy said contentedly. 

Johnny pretended to draw his sword. &#147;What was that...?!&#148;

Dizzy giggled again. &#147;Sorry. That was great, Johnny.&#148;

The blonde pirate grinned and shot a thumbs-up at Dizzy. &#147;That&#146;s my 
girl! So where&#146;s May?&#148;

June sobered up enough to answer that question. &#147;Heh, heh, heh...May&#146;s 
upstairs taking a nap or something. She said she might come down a bit 
later.&#148; 

Just then, May walked over to the sofa that Dizzy, June and Johnny 
were at, with an incredulous smile on her face. &#147;That was wild, 
Johnny. I didn&#146;t think I&#146;d ever catch you doing something like that.&#148;

Johnny crossed his arms. &#147;Hey, I do have a guitar collection. I know 
about these things. I still love 21st Century music. Plus, June 
promised she&#146;d bake me another cherry pie if I could get on that stage 
and sing. And I did!&#148;

June smiled. &#147;Sure Johnny, as soon as we get back I&#146;ll bake you 
another pie. Anyway, I&#146;m pretty tired.&#148; June looked at Dizzy. &#147;You 
wanna crash?&#148;

Dizzy nodded. She was feeling a bit tired too. However the instant May 
saw that, her eyes narrowed. Were they trying to be alone together? 
May placed a hand on June&#146;s shoulder. 

&#147;June, can we talk...in private?&#148; May asked. 

June looked up at May and nodded. &#147;Okay, May. If you want.&#148;

Pointing to the hallway, May walked away and June stood up to follow 
her. Dizzy looked at Johnny to see if he knew what was going on, but 
Johnny just shrugged his shoulders. He hadn&#146;t a clue either. May and 
June stepped out into the quiet hallway, away from earshot. The music 
for the next Karaoke singer played up but luckily it wasn&#146;t loud 
enough to drown out their voices. 

June looked curiously at May. &#147;What&#146;s up, girl?&#148;

May wondered how she was supposed to phrase this. &#147;Um...June...look, I 
have to talk to you about something...&#148;

&#147;Well, yeah you said that already. What is it?&#148;

&#147;Well you and Dizzy,&#148; May started. &#147;You two have really been getting 
close, haven&#146;t you?&#148;

June smiled. &#147;Yeah, I guess so.&#148;

&#147;Well...I was kinda thinking that maybe...you two were...&#148; May trailed 
off.

&#147;You&#146;re not being clear, May.&#148; June said. &#147;What&#146;s wrong? Are you and 
Dizzy still not talking? Do you want me to say something to her for 
you?&#148;

May shook her hands. &#147;No, I mean...we&#146;re not talking, but...I...was 
wondering if...you and Dizzy were...becoming more than friends?&#148;

June&#146;s eyes widened like there was no tomorrow. &#147;Are you crazy?!&#148;

May&#146;s crystal black eyes looked down. &#147;Well, the two of you are 
getting closer, I was just wondering...it seemed like...&#148;

&#147;May. Dizzy and I are just friends. She&#146;s a really nice girl but-&#147;

May cut June off as she stared at Dizzy, who was sitting next to 
Johnny, watching the next act. &#147;Dizzy is great, isn&#146;t she?&#148;

June took note of the dreamy smile on May&#146;s face, and it puzzled her 
for a while. She couldn&#146;t understand why May was acting like this. And 
then it hit her. In the same way it hit April. 

{Is May...falling for Dizzy?} June thought. 

**********

&#147;Here it is.&#148; 

Jam grinned brightly as she led Ky to her apartment. It was really 
late, and Ky didn&#146;t feel right about letting Jam go home all alone at 
this time of night. At first, Jam felt kinda insulted by this. She was 
a first class martial artist after all, plus she...(ahem) &#145;defeated&#146; 
the second self-reliant Gear...

Still, this was a fact that Ky had no idea about, so Jam let it go. 
This time at least. Fact was, Jam was drawn to Ky like a moth to a 
flame. Jam couldn&#146;t explain it, either. But she had her intentions, 
though. In Jam&#146;s mind, no sane man could resist her charms. If she had 
her way...Ky would be hers...

Jam desperately tried to stifle her malevolent giggles, as she brought 
Ky into her apartment. In a few seconds Jam came to her door. 

&#147;Well, this is my place...&#148; Jam said innocently. &#147;You...wanna come in 
side for some coffee, or something?&#148;

&#147;I...well, I...ah...&#148; Ky scratched his head nervously. His intention 
was really just to take Jam home, but if he said no, he might offend 
Jam. And the rules of good etiquette forbade that. Ky was still a 
gentleman, no matter what the situation. 

&#147;I would love to, Miss Kuradoberi.&#148; Ky said. 

Jam&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;What&#146;s all this &#145;Miss Kuradoberi&#146; stuff? Call me 
Jam!&#148;

Ky corrected himself as Jam opened the door to her apartment. &#147;I 
apologize, Miss...Jam.&#148;

As the two stepped in, Ky gazed in wonder at Jam&#146;s gigantic apartment. 
A beautiful Chinese style home, yet it possessed a western feel to it. 
Unfortunately, it was rather messy. Considering the amount of money it 
must have taken to pay for all this, the apartment was in a state, to 
say the least. Discarded pieces of clothing strewn across the floor 
and furniture, and Ky could have sworn he saw a pile of Jam&#146;s clothes 
move.

Jam however, settled nicely into her home environment. The Chinese 
chef called out to Ky as she walked towards the kitchen. &#147;Make 
yourself at home!&#148;

Ky sweatdropped. {But this place is so...}

Deciding to risk sitting down on the couch, Ky rested Thunderseal by 
the door, and slowly ambled over to Jam&#146;s sofa. The young knight took 
a seat on the surprisingly comfortable piece of furniture, and relaxed 
a bit. As messy as Jam&#146;s apartment was, Ky couldn&#146;t help but feel 
slightly unperturbed here. His thoughts always seemed to edge over to 
the Gears or his personal views of evil. It was nice for Ky to be able 
to drift away from these things for a while. 

That moment, Ky felt something. He was sitting on...an object of some 
sort. Shifting to one side, Ky looked down clasped it in his hand. It 
was one Jam&#146;s...panties...

&#147;Well,&#148; Jam said. &#147;You&#146;re certainly bold, aren&#146;t you?&#148; 

Ky blushed and tossed Jam&#146;s underwear to one side. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, I 
just...I-&#147;

Jam cut Ky off with her playful giggles. &#147;Take it easy, I&#146;m joking! 
I&#146;m sorry my place is so messy; I&#146;m just always so busy with training 
or running my restaurant. I should hire a cleaner or something, but I 
just can never get around to do it.&#148;

After being presented with one of the twin cups of coffee that Jam was 
holding, Ky quietly sipped some of it down. &#147;I see.&#148;

Suddenly Ky thought about what Jam had said. &#147;So you train? Are you a 
fighter?&#148;

Jam sipped some of her coffee and took a set next to Ky of the sofa, 
brushing away some of her socks. Hearing what the young knight said, 
Jam playfully winked at him. &#147;Of course! Does that surprise you?&#148;

Ky shook his head. &#147;No. I suppose not.&#148; 

And that was true. After all the amazing things he had seen in the 
tournament, this really wasn&#146;t that much of surprise. Ky doubted 
anything in this world could surprise him any more. He had seen many a 
phenomenon in his lifetime. Like an insane Gear who claimed nobility 
for his actions...

The Frenchman tried not to think about that, and got a suitable 
distraction when a loud thunderbolt crackled in the night sky. Jam 
looked over at the window. It was pouring with rain. Strange, there 
really shouldn&#146;t have been any showers at this time of the year.

&#147;Whoa, it&#146;s really coming down out there, Ky.&#148; Jam said. 

Ky breathed out in frustration and let his eyes roll. He seriously 
didn&#146;t feel like travelling across Fuzhou in a thunderstorm. How 
ironic. 

&#147;Great...&#148; Ky said sardonically. &#147;Just great.&#148;

Jam smiled deviously as a new opportunity flashed inside her mind. She 
thanked whoever needed to be thanked for that rain...

&#147;Don&#146;t worry about it, Ky. You can spend the night here, with me...&#148; 
Jam said. 

Ky&#146;s eyes widened. &#147;But...I do not think that would be proper...I 
mean...&#148;

Jam moved closer to Ky. &#147;Oh, come on! What&#146;s wrong with a couple of 
friends spending the night together, huh? You&#146;ll freeze if you go out 
there and plus, it&#146;ll be fun!&#148; Then Jam looked away mock angrily when 
she added, &#147;And I&#146;d take it as a personal offence if you left now.&#148;

Ky smiled. It was a fair, and gracious offer. &#147;Thank you, Jam.&#148;

Jan grinned widely. &#147;Perfect! Come on, I&#146;ll show you my bedroom.&#148;

In an instant, Jam stood up, and placed her cup of coffee on the 
table. Ky followed suit, and stood to follow Jam into her sleeping 
quarters. Normally Ky would have been uneasy about entering Jam&#146;s 
private living space, but after hearing her refer to the two of them 
as &#145;friends&#146; gave Ky a personal light on the situation. There was 
nothing funny about it. 

Jam brought Ky to her bedroom and showed him around. Unlike the rest 
of Jam&#146;s apartment, this room was actually quite clean and had the 
distinct feeling of a western home. 

Ky&#146;s eyebrow rose. &#147;There&#146;s only one bed.&#148;

Jam slowly walked over to her bed and dragged a finger across it 
sweetly, giving an enthralling smile of seduction. &#147;...Yeah...it&#146;s a 
shame I only have this one...*double-sized* bed...but...&#148;

Ky held a firm fist to his chest. &#147;That is not a problem. For you 
courteous hospitality, I&#146;ll gladly rest on your floor.&#148;

Jam&#146;s right eyebrow twitched as she watched Ky. &#147;...?&#148; 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ky stood regally in front of the new recruits into the Sacred Order of 
Holy Knights. In his left hand, the newly allotted leader of the Order 
brandished the priced gift of his appointment, the legendary 
Thunderseal. 

Ky inspected all of the new recruits with a keen eye. There were 
fifteen of them, quite o them were older than him too, yet they still 
presented Ky with respect, due mostly to Ky&#146;s rank. However, Ky was 
told about one other, a man who Kliff had expressly recommended into 
the Order. This came as a shock, Kliff was retired now, but still he 
took an interest into the goings on of the Order. 

Apparently, the man who had been requested to join the Order was 
someone called Sol Badguy. He was an immensely powerful Bounty Hunter 
who had a renowned chain of kills on his hit list. At first Ky didn&#146;t 
like the idea of installing a mercenary soldier into the Order, but 
this was Kliff&#146;s request. That made it a special case. Plus, Ky was 
eager to see the power of this man.  

Ky and the recruits were in a large grass field just outside of the 
Order&#146;s main training facility. It was far from society, and was a 
good place for training new recruits, as it was pretty much free from 
an attack by any Gears. 

Just as Ky was about to explain the situation to the men before him, a 
muscular and coarse man walked up from the training facility, and 
stood in line with the other recruits. 

The description Ky had been given of Sol confirmed that this man was 
indeed, Sol Badguy. Ky walked over to Sol and presented himself to 
Kliff&#146;s miracle worker. 

Ky held out his hand. &#147;It&#146;s good to finally meet with you, Sol Badguy. 
My name, as you may know, is Ky Kiske. I&#146;m sure we will be very 
successful in our endeavours.&#148;

Sol crossed his arms, closing his ochre eyes sharply. &#147;I&#146;ve never 
shaken hands with anyone.&#148;

The leader of the Order gave Sol a strange look. Almost of contempt. 
&#147;I see...that&#146;s fine.&#148;

Ky retracted his hand and walked back in front of the rest of the 
recruits. &#147;Welcome to the Order. It now falls into your hands to do 
what you can to defend our world. The threat we face is a large and 
almost overwhelming one, but we must trust in ourselves and in the 
hand of God. With His guidance, we can bring end to this nightmare 
once and for all. But none of this can be done without all of you 
sacrifices. Trust in each other, and trust in yourselves. With these 
truths, nothing will prove to be an obstacle to you. Now, before you 
all can proceed, you must pass an initiation test. However, it will be 
acted out on the real battlefield. The ruins of Cologne are under 
constant attack from the Gear menace. Our first mission is to get in 
there and help any possible survivors to escape.&#148;

There was a table just in between Ky and the recruits, and Ky walked 
over to it. It had a map of the Cologne pipe ways. Ky motioned all the 
recruits to gather around the map, and they did so. 

Ky pointed to a pipeline on the map. &#147;This is the best possible route 
into the city, without running into fierce opposition. At 0100 hours. 
We&#146;ll move along these pipe ways up to the city, and then retrieve all 
survivors. By 0300 we will evacuate Cologne. Any questions?&#148;

A younger recruit piped up. &#147;Are we going to have to fight any Gears, 
sir?&#148;

The blonde knight shook his head. &#147;It&#146;s a possibility but it is not 
our mission. Our mission is to rescue the survivors. All battles must 
be avoided until we can safely evacuate all the people in there.&#148; 

Sol scowled. &#147;That&#146;s a waste of time.&#148;

All of the people around the table, including Ky turned to stare at 
Sol for his remark. &#147;What do you mean by that?&#148; Ky asked defensively. 

With his arms still crossed, and his eyes still closed, Sol possessed 
an uncouth fa&ccedil;ade, which was offending his fellow knights. 

Sol explained himself. &#147;That place is wasted. Everybody in the city is 
dead.&#148;

Ky&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;We don&#146;t know that.&#148;

&#147;They&#146;re dead.&#148; Sol said bluntly. &#147;We should be killing the damn 
enemy, not wasting time rescuing ghosts.&#148;

&#147;The Sacred Order of Holy Knights exists to protect humanity, not to 
fight needlessly.&#148; Ky said. &#147;I dare say that your optimism leaves much 
to be desired.&#148;

Sol grinned, opening his eyes. &#147;Optimism and delusions are two 
completely different things...&#148;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ky eyes shot open as the loud crash of a thunderbolt awoke him from 
his sleep. He had to adjust his eyes to remember where he was. It was 
Jam&#146;s place. Ky was sleeping on her couch. He had gone to sleep a few 
hours ago. Then, that dream...or rather, that memory...

Ky remembered that mission rather well. That was his first mission 
with Sol Badguy.        

And his fist tightened with the &#145;oh so blunt&#146; memories of his rival. 
&#147;...Sol...&#148;

**********

Sol climbed up a tall flight of stairs, dusky and old, wooden and 
unstable. He was currently in a small town just outside of Thailand. 
In his run in with Axl, Sol had learned that Project J2 was getting 
underway in China. However Sol (unexplainably) could tell that it was 
nearing completion. He had absolutely no idea why, or for what reason, 
but he knew that what ever was happening, it would get underway soon. 
But even though Sol knew that Project J2 was going down in Fuzhou, he 
didn&#146;t have an exact location. So wisely, the former Knight travelled 
back to the crime boss who hired Sol to take out his last bounty. 
After taking all the money that was owed to him, Sol ordered the crime 
boss to tell him what Project J2 was all about. The crime lord 
outright refused, but this was *Sol Badguy*. Unless you had good 
insurance, it wasn&#146;t a good idea to mess with this guy. Sol quickly 
took out the men that the crime boss had sent to take him out, and 
subsequent to a sword-to-neck demand via the Fireseal, Sol got some 
info too. The bounty hunter was given the address of a certain 
warehouse in Thailand. It had information on Project J2.

And that where he was now. If that crime lord was telling the truth, 
then Sol might be able to figure all of this out. His obsession with 
discovering the truth about Project J2 rivalled his obsession with 
killing off the Gears. Sol had to know what was going on. 

Indolently, Sol stepped on the last steps to the fire escape he was 
climbing. As he reached the top of the fire escape, the door leading 
inside the building was locked. Smirking, Sol gave the door one 
single, brutal kick, shattering the rusty lock with all his Prototype 
Gear strength. With a steely resolve, Sol stepped inside coolly and 
inspected the place. 

Sol&#146;s brown eyes narrowed as he scanned the place over...there was 
nothing here. The place was damn near empty aside from a few pieces of 
old machinery. Sol growled irritably. He couldn&#146;t believe that he was 
foolish enough to fall for this. Now that slimy worm was probably on 
the next flight to Florida...

Just as he was about to leave, something caught his attention at the 
far side of the room. It was not moving, but it looked like the 
silhouette of a...man? 
Curiosity was the final draw point as Sol walked over to this thing, 
whatever it was. As Sol got closer the shadows thinned out, and he 
could see that this thing was under a blanket. 

Type-00 reprimanded himself for being intrigued by what seemed to be 
nothing more than a mere dummy or mannequin, and began to walk away. 
That instant, the sound of electricity burned in the warehouse. 

Sol swung around sharply and looked at the &#145;mere mannequin&#146;. Within 
seconds, the dummy stood up from its sitting position and ripped off 
the blanket that was wrapped around itself. 

And Sol&#146;s eyes widened as he realized who it was... &#147;You?!&#148;

A seemingly unstable and tormented Ky stood in agony, his shoulders 
hunched over and his head twitching every few seconds. Sol couldn&#146;t 
believe it. What the hell was Kiske doing here? Yet Sol didn&#146;t have 
any time to ask that question, as quickly, Ky slashed at Sol with his 
mighty Thunderseal blade. With lion-like agility, Sol leapt back away 
from that slash, and landed a couple metres away. 

Sol still couldn&#146;t get his head around this. {What in the hell is he 
doing here?!} 

Giving Sol no time to adjust, Ky crossed his arms across his body, and 
quickly spread them out again, and by doing so, Ky unleashed a small 
but powerful crescent shaped wave of lightning energy. Sol was 
instantly surprised by how fast this attack was, and rather than 
attempting to dodge it, Type-00 stamped Fireseal into the ground. A 
cluster of concentrated fire blazed a trail across the ground, ramming 
into Ky&#146;s wave of lightning, invoking a compressed explosion. 

Undaunted, Ky leapt through the smoke and cinders of the charred 
floorboards, and hurled himself at Sol. Sol gritted his teeth sharply 
and brought up Fireseal to lock swords with Ky&#146;s Thunderseal. The two 
legendary weapons collided, a quick burst of fire and lightning 
shooting out of the powerful contact. Ky then pushed hard, forcing 
more power into the sword lock. Realizing that he was losing ground to 
Ky, Sol pushed back to match Ky&#146;s pressure, and shoved Ky backwards. 
Ky lost his footing, and stumbled onto the ground. But that wasn&#146;t it 
all he had. In seconds, Ky was up again, with that same look of 
torment and agony in his stance. 

Sol was still confused. Ky was annoying but he never acted like this. 
Even in his eyes, there was no fire. No passion, no killer instinct. 
It was like he was...dead or something...

Again Ky charged at Sol, slashing at him with his celestial blade, but 
Sol block the attack, a stream of static passing along as the two 
blades clashed. Sol decided that we was at least going to play out 
what tired little game this kid wanted to play, so he leapt back 
towards the wall at the other side of the room. After momentarily 
pushing both feet onto the far wall of the warehouse, Sol used all of 
the momentum and skill and installed it into one flying kick. 

Instantly, Sol&#146;s leg rammed brutally into Ky&#146;s chest, and even then 
Sol assumed he would at least be winded, but no such luck. Ky 
recovered almost instantaneously and slashed at Sol&#146;s waist. The 
attack cut open the Gear&#146;s shirt, and Ky gave Sol no time to adapt as 
he quickly followed it up with a second wave of lightning. 

This one was bang on its mark and Sol was flung back by the force of 
Ky&#146;s crescent-shaped lightning wave. Sol slid back across the dusty 
floorboards, and clutched at his ribs. The Guilty Gear then brought 
his gloved hand up and looked at it. 

There were infinitesimal traces of blood. It was miniscule, but it was 
there. Sol grinned. The kid had actually drawn blood. 

Sol decided that the time for games was over, and let his battle ready 
heartiness guide him. If Ky wanted a fight, he&#146;d get one. It was his 
funeral...

Sol roared into the echoing air of the warehouse, and charged at Ky, 
keeping as low to the ground as he possibly could. Then as he reached 
Ky&#146;s proximity, Sol jumped up and enveloped his sword with a mighty, 
blazing flame. The force was so strong that Ky was dragged up into the 
air with Sol, and every tendon in Sol&#146;s body tightened as he felt the 
Fireseal cut through something. Ky was thrown back awkwardly by the 
might of Sol&#146;s rising attack, and was rammed back into an old machine 
of obsolete use. 

Sol landed sharply and inspected the damage he had done. He knew he 
had done major damage with that last attack. 

And what he saw shocked him. {What the...?!}

Ky&#146;s left arm had been completely severed off. In fact his arm was 
lying over in the other corner of the room, blackened by Sol&#146;s raging 
fire. But that wasn&#146;t what was shocking Sol. What stunned him was the 
fact that Ky was standing up as if nothing had happened. 

Now Sol *knew* something was wrong. He was pretty sure that Ky hadn&#146;t 
been changed into a Gear; it didn&#146;t look like that at all. But then 
Sol took a closer look at the mound that was formally Ky&#146;s arm. 

There was no blood. Just streaks of electricity and...wires?!

{It&#146;s a machine?} Sol thought confusedly. 

It was true. Whatever it was, it wasn&#146;t Ky and it wasn&#146;t human. The 
fake uniform of the Order that Robo Ky was wearing the split apart, 
shredded probably by Sol&#146;s previous attack, and it revealed something 
on his chest. A timer. 

The pieces of the puzzle started to fix themselves together in Sol&#146;s 
brain, and he made a dash for the window. If Sol&#146;s guess was right, 
this whole thing was a trap to kill him off, and that timer was 
actually a bomb. Summoning all of his will, Sol hurled himself through 
towards the dirty window and smashed through it as he dove out into 
streets. While in midair, the bomb that was inside of Robo Ky 
exploded, erupting in an earth shattering rumble that caught the 
attention from people all around. With a loud thud, Sol landed in a 
dumpster in the alleyway, and covered his face as blasted bricks, 
cinders and shards of glass came falling down. 

In a few seconds, the upheaval ended, and the shower of debris ended. 
Sol let out a groan of frustration and slowly climbed out of the 
dumpster. Setting both feet firmly on the floor, Sol dusted himself 
off. Even though that little stunt was a total disaster, he did manage 
to figure out one thing.

If someone was willing to go to those lengths to keep him from finding 
out the truth about Project J2, then it had to be serious. Just as Sol 
decided to walk away, one final piece of debris fell from warehouse, 
which was now in flames. 

The head of Robo Ky. 

Sol scowled at the thing. It was nowhere near as powerful as the 
original, but it certainly had his spunk. 

**********

&#147;MILLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&#148;

Millia felt her bones chill to their very marrow. &#147;Zato...&#148;

The slithering madness of Eddie&#146;s dark influence eased up enough for 
Zato to properly acknowledge the presence of his mortal enemy. 

Zato weakly grinned while doing so. &#147;So...you&#146;ve come...I knew you 
would...&#148;

Millia scowled angrily. &#147;Stop smiling! I&#146;m here to kill you!&#148;

&#147;Is that so?&#148; Zato said. &#147;Well we shall see...I think it&#146;s high time I 
paid you back for your betrayal, Millia. You do remember...don&#146;t 
you...my little flower?&#148;

How could she forget? Even though it seemed like a lifetime ago, 
Millia had clear memories of the day she left the Assassin 
Organization. That was the day her life changed. The day she became 
nothing more than a drifting recluse, not fit to live in public world. 
The only thing that Millia could call home was the shadows. 

Well no more. 

Millia pointed to her adversary. &#147;This cannot go on, Zato...I will not 
live me life in fear any longer! The time of your reckoning is here, 
Zato-ONE!!&#148;

The Assassin leader smirked as Millia took on a fighting stance. &#147;Heh, 
heh...Don&#146;t talk...just fight...!&#148;

Over at the other side of the room, Baiken sat next to Venom&#146;s 
battered body, and reluctantly she managed to pull him into a sitting 
position. The samurai inspected the wound at Venom&#146;s waist. It was 
severe, but he could hold up for a while. 

Dazedly, Venom awoke from his Zato-induced unconsciousness. &#147;...Where 
am...I...&#148; Venom looked up. &#147;...You?&#148;

Baiken snorted at such a rude acknowledgement. &#147;Humph. You&#146;re an 
idiot. You took him on alone. What a fool you are.&#148;

The irony of the situation didn&#146;t escape Venom as he grimly chuckled 
at that. &#147;...I think I am aware of that...I thought I could...save 
him...but...&#148;

&#147;But, you were not strong enough.&#148; Baiken filled in. &#147;I see. But you 
knew that you couldn&#146;t beat him, didn&#146;t you?&#148;

Venom&#146;s eyes filled with confusion. &#147;What do you mean by that?&#148;

&#147;Come on. You said you needed Millia&#146;s help to find Zato, yet it only 
took us a couple of days to get to him. There was another reason for 
it, was there not?&#148;

He had to admit it. &#147;...I did not...think that I could defeat Zato 
alone...I needed her help...&#148;

Baiken nodded. &#147;I thought so. Well...it&#146;s up to Millia now.&#148;

Realizing that this was the moment of truth, Millia gathered all of 
her feelings, will and determination and placed it all into one single 
charge. Millia instantly ran towards Zato, her muscles tensing and as 
each step brought her closer and closer to the Shadow King. 

As she neared Zato, Millia&#146;s deadly hair contorted into a massive 
whip-like form and slashed at Zato&#146;s living corpse. Zato only grinned, 
and allowed his body to be covered in shadows, and then he sunk into 
the moving shadow pool surrounding his feet. The attack completely 
missed, as the shadow puddle zipped around Millia&#146;s legs in one clear 
movement. Zato then materialized into his human form, beaming a cruel 
grin at Millia. 

&#147;Is that it? Slayer taught you better, didn&#146;t he?&#148;

Millia&#146;s eyes filled with anger as she swerved around to face Zato. 
&#147;How dare you mention his name!?&#148;
 
The Russian woman growled fiercely as she crouched down and aimed a 
sharp kick at his ankles, but again the king of the shadows sunk into 
his puddle, and avoided the attack. Millia&#146;s head darted from side to 
side as she searched for Zato&#146;s whereabouts. In a flash he reappeared 
behind Millia, with that same cocky grin.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong, my little flower?&#148; Zato said in pure amusement. &#147;Are 
you ashamed of your actions? Did it hurt? To be reminded of your 
betrayal?&#148;

Millia said nothing, the only answer she had to Zato&#146;s question was 
the slash of her hair. Zato smiled as he ducked under the attack, and 
gained an opening into Millia&#146;s weak defence. As Zato stood back up, 
he unceremoniously dragged both of his arms into the air, and the dark 
shadows around his ankles followed suit. A gigantic shadow claw 
emerged from below, and Millia could only gasp as it knocked her clear 
into the air. The blonde woman forced herself to gain control of the 
situation and steadied herself as she ascended into the air. Millia 
took a glance at what was below her. Zato was gone. But she could 
still feel him...somewhere. That wretched link between then served 
more purposes that just simple annoyance. Millia could feel that Zato 
had intentionally knocked her into the air. Rather than wait and see 
what he was planning, Millia dove for the dusty floorboards of the 
abandoned training centre, and crashed down hard upon them. 

Millia coughed up the traces of dust that clogged her throat, and 
stood up. Stilling herself for a few seconds, Millia focused her 
mind&#146;s eye on the enemy. She had to predict where Zato was next going 
to appear. Millia focused her senses in the same way that Venom had 
previously done, and all of a sudden, everything around her fell out 
of focus, like Millia had fallen into a void of nothingness. Slowly 
that nothingness was replaced by spiritually virtual world, identical 
to her own. She felt of a drop of sweat trickle down her face, but she 
had to concentrate. Then at some point, Millia sensed three units of 
energy enter the world. Two were clustered together, those were 
obviously Baiken and Venom...and a third one was slowly creeping up on 
her...from behind. 

Millia had her man. 

Zato&#146;s shadow puddle slowly crept up on Millia&#146;s rear, and from that 
puddle arose the Assassin leader. Drawing his fist back to strike at a 
seemingly defenceless Millia, Zato gasped in shock as a translucent 
disk of rapid spinning energy formed around the Russian orphan. The 
disk that Millia formed around her body knocked Zato back with a 
surprisingly efficient force, and Zato was slammed hard into the far 
wall of the warehouse. Zato&#146;s living corpse then bounced off of it, 
and collapsed onto the ground. The Spanish killer smiled at that 
little stunt, and wiped the small trail of blood trickling down from 
his mouth. 

&#147;Tch, not bad, woman...&#148; Zato breathed darkly. 

Seeing that he could no longer confuse Millia by &#145;breaking the law&#146;, 
Zato chose a different route. But before he did, Zato looked over at 
Millia, quite a few metres away from him. But what was odd was the 
fact that she was standing in an odd position in one place. Zato was 
blind, but his senses were more than sharp enough to know that Millia 
was leaving herself open. Then he gritted his teeth in anger when he 
realized why she was doing this. Above Zato was a large sphere of 
powerful shining blue energy, something that Millia had obviously 
formulated psychically. Millia grimaced at Zato as tiny beads of sweat 
trickled down her face. This wasn&#146;t a normal part of her arsenal but 
if it meant Zato&#146;s defeat, she&#146;d gladly use it. In fear of what might 
happen if he didn&#146;t, Zato brought his arms over his head and vainly 
called upon his shadows to protect him. However it was too little, too 
late as the sphere crashed down upon Zato&#146;s body. 

The former leader of the Assassin Organization snarled in fury as 
Millia&#146;s attack drilled into him. The psychic energy it took to create 
that drained Millia by a tad, and she put herself down to one knee to 
regain some energy. 

As the psychic sphere dissolved into nothingness, Zato fractiously 
stood up, recalling his shadow to his ankles. Zato directly summoned 
up his companion, weapon and possessor, the one known as Eddie, and 
this little shadow demon morphed itself into a sharp buzzsaw like 
being. Millia&#146;s eyes shot open at the same time as the cruel looking 
buzzsaw hacked and sliced through the dusty floorboards. With all her 
assassin skill, Millia elegantly bounded into the crisp air, and 
dashed aerially towards Zato. Zato grinned as he was ready to seize 
has chance, and called forth another giant shadow claw. 

{Dammit!} Due to the fact that she had thrown herself so recklessly at 
Zato, Millia did not have time or speed to avoid this attack, and her 
deep, seductive voice howled in pain as the shadow claw sliced at her 
stomach. 

Zato again grinned cockily as Millia&#146;s body came crashing down on the 
hard, dust-covered floorboards.  

&#147;Heh, heh, heh! That new attack of yours surprised me! Who would have 
thought the great Zato-ONE could be so careless? Oh well, everyone has 
their own shortcomings. But it seems that yours have gotten the better 
of you, Millia.&#148;

Millia groaned inwardly as she pulled herself to her feet. &#147;You always 
were too egotistical to think straight...&#148;

The unwilling assassin charged again at Zato, running towards him with 
a sharp quickness. Zato chuckled at Millia&#146;s blind arrogance and the 
shadow puddle instantly formed into the shape of a snapdragon to 
punish Millia for this conceit. Then, with a mischievous glint in her 
eye, Millia preformed a quick forward roll, which allowed her to 
completely avoid Zato&#146;s attack. Zato sensed that his move missed its 
mark and could do nothing to stop Millia as her hair morphed into the 
form of a dagger and stabbed at his face. Zato felt his skin being 
sliced open by the attack, and angrily used his shadows to shove 
Millia away. Millia was flung back by Zato&#146;s sudden attack and Millia 
had to crouch down to slow herself into a stop.

The blood on Zato&#146;s face darkened into a pitch black as his anger took 
over. &#147;You&#146;ll pay for that, woman.&#148;

Zato seethed as this woman merely stood up and adopted another 
fighting stance. All his life he had hated woman. But there was no 
woman he hated anymore than Millia. Whilst he stared at Millia, Zato 
recalled his old life. The days of when he was nothing more than a 
weakling. A pathetic underling that served under administrative 
imbeciles who cared more about the profit of an assassination, rather 
than the kill. Zato hated those. He was disgusted with his own lack of 
ability. So against all sense, he located the ancient books of the 
&#145;Forbidden Arts&#146;. By invoking the powers that secrets that lay inside, 
Zato gained the power to manipulate shadows. His own and those of 
others. In exchange for this tremendous power, Zato lost his sense of 
sight. But all his other sense were so enhanced, that he had more than 
enough to perceive his surroundings, better than he could with sight 
alone. In a few weeks time, Zato was the leader of the Assassin 
Organization. Then...on the day of his biggest mission ever, Zato 
placed the key role of this mission to one woman. The one woman who he 
had ever trusted in his whole life. Millia Rage. But rather than 
accept that great honor, she abandoned her post. The whole mission was 
thrown into complete chaos and Zato-ONE was caught in the act. For his 
folly, Zato was imprisoned in the prison of dimension where he had to 
languish about the foolish trust he placed in Millia. Then, when Zato 
had begun to lose all hope of freedom, a tall man with a large scythe 
approached him and offered Zato&#146;s freedom if he entered some crazy 
tournament. Naturally, Zato agreed, anything to get out of prison, and 
planned his revenge against Millia. Then...on the day he finally faced 
Millia, Zato suffered the first defeat of he had ever received since 
he unlocked his shadow powers. And it was from this defeat that Eddie, 
the shadow Zato assumed he had control over, took possession of his 
body. Ever since then, Zato had been drifting, teetering on the very 
edge of madness. 

All his life he had craved power. And after so long, Zato finally 
achieved the perfection he yearned for. But for what? To be taken down 
by a treacherous runaway and his own shadow? There were very few 
things in the world that Zato had a grasp of, but he understood 
this... 

Even if he was just a living corpse, a wraith of his former self, no 
living thing had authority over his will. And Zato wouldn&#146;t let one 
impetuous woman contradict that belief. If Zato would die, then he 
would die as a king.

Zato pointed fiercely at Millia. &#147;I&#146;m going to kill you!!&#148;

Defying his previous strategies, Zato wrapped himself in his shadow 
and dashed towards Millia. Millia was far too surprised by this change 
in approach to come up with a suitable counter attack, and was thrown 
back by the absolute force of Zato&#146;s ramming assault. Before long, 
Millia was pushed up against a well, but Zato&#146;s anger did not relent 
and his sneaky shadow influenced hands forged a strangle hold on 
Millia&#146;s neck. Millia felt herself losing her breath, and desperately 
tried to free herself from Zato&#146;s grip before she lost consciousness. 
Zato sensed that Millia&#146;s hair was going to form into something and 
before she could attack him, a large shadow hand grabbed hold of 
Millia&#146;s body, and brutally tossed her across the warehouse. Millia 
screamed as she was hurled into a well-stocked pile of crakes. The 
young assassin runaway groaned awkwardly from that mind-bending throw, 
but had no time to recover as a floor crawling shadow smashed into the 
crates and headed straight for her. Millia leapt out of the way to 
avoid the demon shadow, and landed a few metres away from Zato. 

She swore she&#146;d never use the Living Lancer again, but...Millia 
crouched forwards and let her hair whip and thrash around her head in 
a circular motion, firing dart shaped projectile constructed from her 
own hair. The thin lance of hair directed itself towards Zato, but 
Zato had long since dropped the formalities. He was going to give this 
his all. Sinking his hands into his shadow, Zato pulled out a thin 
shield of shadow, that completely reflected the attack, and sent it 
back to towards Millia. The crystal-eyed woman shrieked in pain as the 
thin dart lodged itself in her shoulder in one fierce strike. Zato 
dashed at Millia, yelling out his world shaking rage and concentrating 
it into three demon-headed shadow dogs that knocked the wind out of 
Millia, and furiously flung her two one side. 

Zato sneered at his fallen rival. But was in no way willing to make 
any snappy commands about her power. The time for jokes had long past. 
Placing a weak grip on the Living Lancer in her shoulder, Millia&#146;s 
face grimaced in pain as she slowly withdrew the dart from the wound 
in had cleaved open. And with one strain of effort, Millia savagely 
pulled it free. She then tossed it to one side, and located her hair 
to the ground, pushing up. This gave her enough leverage to get back 
on her feet.

Millia clutched her shoulder. {He&#146;s not playing around...he wants to 
finish this...} And narrowed her eyes. &#147;Then so be it.&#148;

Ignoring her injuries for the time being, Millia thrust herself into 
the air, bounding off the ground. Now that she high enough, Millia 
followed Zato&#146;s example and wrapped herself inside a shell of her own 
hair. This shell took on the form of a crescent shaped moon. This moon 
then revolved around and around and around, hurling itself towards 
Zato. That meant nothing to Zato, no matter how intimidating it may 
have appeared to be and once again he called upon the power of the 
mighty shadow swarming around his ankles. From that shadow 
materialized two massive shadow hands. These hands sought out Millia&#146;s 
crescent shaped moon assault, and held it fast. Due to so much 
pressure, Millia had no choice but to dissolve the Bad Moon and land 
before Zato&#146;s shadow hands could crush her. Millia landed, but oddly, 
and breathed in hard. She was starting to feel the weight of her 
injuries. Millia would pass out unless she made a good attack, and 
fast. 

Seeing the time ripe for a big attack, Millia held her arms out and 
span, causing three translucent disks to awaken and fire at Zato. 
However, Zato easily saw this coming, and sunk into his nightmarish 
pool of shadows to avoid all three of Millia&#146;s formidable projectile 
attacks. 

&#147;It can&#146;t be!&#148; Millia gasped as all her attacks sliced up the far 
walls of the warehouse and not Zato. She had installed all of her 
power into that attack and now...

As Zato rose from his shadow puddle, he breathed in heavily. Although 
he hadn&#146;t sustained much damage, all of his efforts were drawing his 
energy. But his anger was enough to keep him going. Zato was going to 
finish this once and for all. 

Baiken glared angrily at this sight. Millia had previously warned her 
to stay out of the fight, even if Millia was losing. Baiken did agree 
to that. But following this request was not easy. In fact Baiken 
already had her hand on the hilt of her sword. And Baiken didn&#146;t care 
what Millia felt about the situation, if things got worse; the cerise 
haired samurai was prepared to step in. But whereas Baiken was 
infuriated, Venom&#146;s eyes were finally opening.

Zato was in torment. Venom could see it in his every action. If Zato 
were ever to rest easy, then Venom had to take his life. He owed that 
much to his master. The English Assassin could not let a friend down. 
Baiken saw Zato hammer into Millia with some more of his shadowy 
attacks, and decided that she had to intervene, until Venom stood up 
and placed a staying hand in front of her. 

&#147;You will stay out of this. This is assassin business. It is my 
responsibility.&#148;

Baiken glared at Venom. &#147;Didn&#146;t Zato tear you apart? Do you really 
think you can defeat him now, in your state?&#148;

Venom took a quick look at the injury he acquired whilst fighting with 
Zato. &#147;I understand what I have to do now. It is up to me to save 
him.&#148;

Over at the other side of the warehouse, Zato had his arms crossed 
condescendingly while a shadow hand held Millia by the collar. Zato 
gritted as he had Millia at his mercy.

&#147;To think my whole life has been destroyed by a worthless, cowardly 
assassin who ran away from her destiny. After all this time...you will 
finally pay for your betrayal...&#148;

&#147;OOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!&#148;

Zato&#146;s head swung around sharply as he heard someone scream a heart 
shattering battle cry. It sounded like Venom...The Zato coughed up a 
few traces of blood as a spherical ball rammed against his stomach. 
Tautening and adapting all of his soul to this one endevour, Venom 
rushed towards Zato and twirled his snooker cue at almost vicious 
speeds. The surprise of Venom&#146;s attack caught him off guard so 
efficiently, that Zato had no way of defending against them. The 
Spanish killer was knocked back with the momentary yet fierce strength 
of Venom. As he slowed to a stop, Zato grinned at Venom. 

&#147;Looks like you&#146;ve finally decided to come out of hiding, eh?&#148;

Venom pointed his cue at Zato. &#147;No more games Zato-ONE.&#148;

Zato snorted at that and rushed towards Venom, but this wasn&#146;t the 
same man who he had fought with a few hours prior. This Venom had his 
priorities in the right order. As Zato neared him, Venom created a 
snooker ball by hand, and positioned it into the air. Zato rushed 
quickly towards Venom, however the attack missed the bulls eye, as 
Venom completely disappeared, even from Zato&#146;s senses. The mysticism 
of Venom&#146;s teleportation ability allowed him to reappear in the 
positioning of the ball he previously created. And from that position, 
Venom fired another one of his deeply powerful balls of kinetic power, 
shot unswervingly at Zato, smashing into his open back. Gracefully, 
Venom landed, but when he did so, Venom felt a twitch in his body. The 
damage done from the previous fight was taking its toll. He wouldn&#146;t 
last long unless he put Zato away right here, right now.   

Remembering what was at stake and what would happen if he failed, 
Venom steadied his shaking body and held his ground. It fell to Venom 
to bring about Zato&#146;s reckoning. Once again, in one swift motion, 
Venom&#146;s hand made a wave motion with his free hand and created a 
temporal distortion that took on the form of a tear into another 
dimension. From this other dimension came a massive sphere of burning 
red energy. Zato gasped. He could feel its energy. And as instinct 
demanded him to destroy the thing, logic rejected the idea. He had 
been too tired out by his fight with Millia to either block of dodge 
it. In an instant, all of Zato&#146;s fears came true as the powerful globe 
of crystallized energy drilled and smashed into Zato&#146;s body. His 
defences drained by all of his battles. The tearing power of Venom&#146;s 
ultimate attack was enough to knock Zato off his feet and smash him 
into the further wall, erupting in a giant rumble, which echoed 
throughout the whole warehouse. 

Then there was silence. All that was left was the sound of a few bits 
of rubble clattering against Zato&#146;s unmoving body. 

&#147;Have...have I...done it?&#148; Venom asked himself tiredly. {I did it.}

Venom fell to his knees, panting and whizzing for air. It had absorbed 
all of his remaining strength to pull off that little rampage. But he 
had done it. Zato was finally set free from his torture. 

&#147;Heh, heh, heh...&#148;

Venom&#146;s head jerked up in attentiveness as he heard a maniacal 
chuckle. His blue eyes locked themselves onto the hole in the wall 
that the impact of his attack had created. He inspected the thing and 
gasped when he saw that Zato&#146;s body...was still moving. 

Laughing another set of chuckles as he half-heartedly stood up, 
pushing away the rubble. &#147;Heh, heh, heh...this...is the power I saw in 
you when I first selected you to join the organization...too bad that 
power wasn&#146;t enough.&#148;

Zato wiped the blood and dust away from his face and eye visor. &#147;Now 
I&#146;ll show you...why you&#146;re nothing but an underling!&#148;

Zato sunk into the ground and raised two of his fingers into the air. 
Following his actions, a shadowy drill surged up from the ground below 
Venom. The young man moved to the right to avoid the attack, but that 
wasn&#146;t enough. Immediately the drill cut through a section of Venom&#146;s 
flesh at the base of his leg, and once again he fell to his knees 
again as it dissolve away.

&#147;Lesson No.1,&#148; Zato said. &#147;Paralyse your target. Make sure he can&#146;t 
escape...&#148;

Venom glowered as he found he had a hard time moving his ankle.  

&#147;Lesson No.2,&#148; Zato sharply kicked Venom&#146;s cue from his hand, then let 
a shadow fist grab his former right-hand man by the neck. &#147;Disable any 
way for them to fight back.&#148;

&#147;And finally lesson No. 3,&#148; Zato grinned as he added, &#147;Silently 
exterminate your target.&#148;

Baiken pulled Millia up into a sitting position over at the other side 
of the warehouse, and wiped some of the sweaty gloss off of her face. 
&#147;Are you okay?&#148;

Millia coughed a bit. &#147;I&#146;m...fine. Where...is he...?&#148;   

Baiken nodded over at the two warring assassins. &#147;Over there. Fighting 
Venom.&#148;

Weakly Millia pushed herself up onto her feet, and Baiken gave her a 
hand up. &#147;I...have to stop...Zato...&#148;

Just as she started to walk away, Baiken placed a hand on Millia&#146;s 
shoulder. &#147;Millia.&#148;

The unwilling assassin looked back. &#147;Yes?&#148;

Baiken&#146;s eye accentuated the sternness of this command. &#147;Don&#146;t hold 
back.&#148;

Venom shut his eyes as he prepared for an end that was fast coming; He 
just wished it didn&#146;t have to end like this. Venom wished he had the 
power to help his friend. Then, as he was about to receive his final 
lesson, Zato&#146;s attention became focused on another. 

Millia stood firm, stern and in command, something that neither Zato 
nor Baiken had seen in her before. Millia had changed somehow. Her 
stone cold crystal blue eyes observed Zato-ONE with strong intent. 
This was it. The time for mercy was over. Someone had to die. 

&#147;Put him down, Zato.&#148; Millia said calmly. 

Zato sneered and tossed Venom to one side. &#147;So you&#146;re still alive?&#148;

Realizing that the saga had to come to an end, Millia dashed at 
Zato-ONE with almost inhuman speed. Not the type to be outdone, Zato 
answered that with another shadow drill to block her path. Millia 
simply darted around the drill and continued for Zato. Zato was 
infuriated with that blatant rejection, and made his shadow transform 
into a dagger like attack to fend off Millia&#146;s advances. Millia saw 
this and crouched over into a forward roll that tucked her under 
Zato&#146;s assault. Millia swiftly stood up, behind Zato, and her unusual 
hair darted and jabbed in a series of quick and sharp strikes, slicing 
at Zato&#146;s back. As the blows subsided, Zato fell to one knee. He was 
quickly weakening. But Millia gave him no time to rejuvenate himself, 
and knocked the king of shadows away with the translucent ring of pure 
energy that formed around Millia&#146;s supple body. Zato crashed into the 
a few metres from Millia, and struggled to get back onto his feet. 

&#147;What...is...happening to...me...? AAAAAAGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!&#148;

Zato clutched his head in seething pain as Eddie&#146;s influence tried to 
take over. Then as Zato suffered this agony, Venom jumped at him from 
behind, grasped Zato by the neck. The English assassin had Zato in a 
lock. 

&#147;Millia!&#148; Venom yelled desperately. &#147;Finish it! Now!&#148;

Millia nodded, taking one final look at her master before she brought 
about his end. In a blast of momentum, Millia leaned over and stabbed 
her hair into the ground. Seeing that the nexus of Millia&#146;s attack was 
about to com down on him, Venom quickly jumped back just before a beam 
of hot golden white light bathed Zato. His body then began to slowly 
rise into the air, as the shadow king was skewered by two blasts of 
seemingly golden hair. 

In a flash, the attack came to fruition, and Zato&#146;s shadow wrapped 
body fell down into an unceremonious pile. 

Zato-ONE was dead.

Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts 
----------------------

* Whoa! 20-page chapter! Betcha that&#146;ll put me well ahead of Zeronova 
in word count, eh?

* Sorry for the wait on this chapter, I&#146;ve just been working on one of 
my other stories. In fact I was writing a bit of it a few days ago and 
it was so boring! The minute I came back to DB, BS I was having fun. 
Wonder why that is? 

* And an added sorry for any errors, this is hot off the keyboard. 

* I made Jam&#146;s apartment messy because I kinda see her living her life 
like Misato Katsuragi of Evangelion fame. Don&#146;t ask me why.  

* I&#146;m giving my regards to all you lucky devils in the US who are 
playing GGX2...does anybody have any idea when us UK Guilty Gear 
maniacs will get the game? 

* Oh and the song &#145;Sexy Boy&#146; is not mine, it&#146;s Shawn Michaels theme 
and is property of him and...the WWE, I guess. I claim no ownership of 
it.
