May blinked furiously as the menacing presence of Justice graced her 
dark ebony eyes. Though she had heard stories about Justice and his 
legacy from Johnny and some of the other members of the crew...she had 
always considered these stories to be nothing more than overblown 
fabrications. However May started to realize just how fearsome and 
frightening the Gear Commander really was. 

Even before, when Dizzy had been kidnapped, May had not gotten a good 
look at Justice. The whole incident was over in a flash. But now his 
clear, intimidating figure was standing firm right above her. 

May felt a bead of sweat trail down the side of her face, and her 
thumping heartbeat took on a stronger beat. The pirate girl was aware 
of the fear inside her...but Dizzy, her newfound love, was trapped by 
this beast&#146;s will. Dizzy had to be set free and right now, the only 
person who could do it was May. 

May wiped her brow free of sweat. {It&#146;s okay, Dizzy. I&#146;ll get you out 
of this.}

In seconds, the pirate May was dashing up the one hundred stepped 
stairway to heaven, cruise-lining for the icy prison of Dizzy, just 
above those broken gates. Justice looked at this young woman as she 
ran up the stairway. In a very blunt way, May&#146;s disregard for him 
annoyed Justice. But then also, the King of Gears had to admit that he 
was impressed by her bravery. Not many people had the bottle, spirit 
or backbone to even challenge him. That was worth praise even in 
itself. 

May continued to run up the stairs towards Dizzy, almost stumbling 
along the path, that is until she was cut off by Justice&#146;s awesome 
figure, blurring in front of her. She gasped in shock as her feet came 
to a stop and Justice slowly inspected his quarry. 

&#147;Human girl...why do you come here?&#148; Justice asked inquisitively, 
&#147;Surely you realize the fate that will befall you if you dare to cross 
me.&#148;   

May tried to hide the fear in her voice. &#147;G...get outta my way.&#148;

Justice chuckled. He always had the ability to sense fear in someone. 
This human girl reeked of it. But he also felt a strong determination 
within her. &#147;Could it be that you are here to destroy me?&#148;

May&#146;s eyes narrowed. Her focus was still on Dizzy and the ice prison 
she was frozen in, but she was still incensed enough to get busy. 

&#147;Let Dizzy go!&#148; May yelled. 

Justice took that moment to look back at Dizzy. She was just above the 
broken gates, frozen. Though it seemed like he needed no one, Justice 
took a special interest in Dizzy. Her power, although dormant, was 
enormous. Even from the moment he was reborn, the leader of the Gears 
felt Dizzy&#146;s immense strength. It was a power only a being such as a 
Gear could possess. A strength that had to be isolated and controlled. 
And once Justice was done with this place, he would take a deeper 
study into Dizzy&#146;s powers. 

&#147;She...&#148; Justice breathed stiflingly. &#147;...Is of precious blood. She is 
a unique entity chosen by destiny to fight for my cause. A Gear is a 
lifeforce that can transcend all levels of might a mere human could 
even hope to achieve. She is superior to you and your kind in every 
way possible.&#148;

May scowled. &#147;What are you talking about?! Dizzy isn&#146;t some kind of 
soldier you can just use when you feel like it!&#148;

&#147;Ha, ha, ha, ha!&#148; Justice laughed loudly, his bellowed chortles 
echoing within the stairway to heaven. &#147;We were designed to be nothing 
more than weapons by your kind, human. Look at her body.&#148;

Justice pointed over to Dizzy&#146;s ice prison. Though seeing her was 
blurry due to the choppy build up of ice, May had a fairly good clear 
view of her imprisoned love.

&#147;In the eyes of your kind,&#148; Justice said. &#147;She is nothing more than a 
weapon in a human shell. And in some respects, that child is a weapon. 
But her free will makes her special. No Gear created after me, living 
or dead, cannot be absolutely free from my will. But her...she is 
unique. And that makes her worthy of my quest. The elimination of your 
race. Soon...she will be your enemy.&#148;

May gripped her fist together. &#147;You can&#146;t do that to her!&#148;

Again, Justice laughed. It goes without saying that he was not taking 
May seriously. But it also goes without saying that Justice had every 
reason not to be cautious. Even in his current state, body his 
battered and chipped, his left arm dismembered, Justice was still 
extremely powerful. Defeating a small human girl was no difficulty to 
him. 

Justice steeled his body. &#147;Your kind must be defeated.&#148;

May stepped back a bit. She knew she was afraid but it was only now 
that the brunette actually felt that chilling fear, drilling at her 
from within the depths of her stomach.

But Dizzy was in danger.

And as long as Dizzy&#146;s safety was put in question, May would never let 
fear stop her. May stood silent for a second, then whipped her anchor 
around her shoulders, and took on a cadenced fighting stance. With all 
her might, May gripped the weighty anchor and firmly locked her eyes 
on Justice. &#147;Get outta my way!&#148; May yelled again.

&#147;You are wasting your life and my time, human. Stand aside or you will 
be the first to feel the anger of the Gear race.&#148;

That was it. No more. May could not take any more of this. If she 
could not go around Justice to get to Dizzy, then she would go 
*through* him. It was almost as if May&#146;s feet did their own thinking, 
when the propelled her forwards at the dismembered God of Destruction 
and heaved her colossal anchor at his body. 

Justice merely tensed the grip he had on his fist, and smoothly 
swerved to one side as May&#146;s iron anchor thrashed around in his 
direction. The anchor clashed with the ground striking up fierce 
sparks of static. But May did not let that trouble her. The young 
pirate dragged and heaved up her unusual weapon, pitching herself at 
Justice once more. May ran towards her Gear enemy with quickening 
anger, and horizontally slashed at Justice&#146;s already damaged chest. 
Justice weighed his options. He could easily crush this girl like the 
measly little gnat she was, but then also, Justice had a liking 
towards toying with May&#146;s &#145;type&#146;. She was no threat to him whatsoever. 

Justice pushed his body backwards through the crispy air and leaned 
back, May&#146;s anchor sailing clear over his body. May scoffed at this 
failed attempt to damage Dizzy&#146;s kidnapper. Quickly, Justice moved 
from his former position, and stood straight up, waving the back of 
his hand tauntingly at May.

That did not help the chagrin of the pirate. With her teeth gritted 
and her body shaking, May was felt insulted by the simple fact that 
Justice was not taking her seriously. 

May&#146;s anger drove her into attacking for a third time, and May 
instantly charged Justice again. Foolishness and courage be damned, 
this maniac had to be taught a lesson. Catching sight of this, Justice 
made a shallow turn to the left, clattering his long metallic, 
chain-like tail against the carpeted steps. Because her advance was so 
blind in nature, May could not stop herself in time and tripped over 
Justice&#146;s tail. 

A haughty laugh bellowed around May&#146;s ears as she stumbled along the 
steps, and eventually fell over, raising up clouds of dust and dirt as 
her lithe body crashed against the ground. 

May felt her blood throbbing. {He&#146;s just laughing at me...}

The electricity around Justice&#146;s body started to streak up again. The 
more he wasted his time with May the more time his body had to 
rejuvenate itself from his battle with Sol.  

&#147;Human girl...&#148; Justice was able to say as his laughter stopped. &#147;You 
are not going to be able to defeat me.&#148;

The next sound to follow Justice&#146;s declaration was the clashing metal 
sound of May&#146;s anchor ramming into the ground. The sky-flying pirate 
used her large weapon for leverage and pushed herself back onto her 
feet. In one swing, May pulled her anchor back onto her shoulders, and 
started another sequential dash at &#145;Daigyakusatsu no Kami&#146;. Rather 
than swing her anchor, May slipped it between her arm and her waist 
and attempted to ram into Justice. However the Gear cleverly noticed 
this. The rocket-powered energy generators over Justice&#146;s shoulders 
charged up with propulsive energy, and heaved his techno-biochemical 
body off the floor and into the air.    

As May passed under him, Justice took a good look at May. At first 
glance, she was nothing more than a snivelling human child at best. 
But she was attacking again and again and did not seem to be losing 
energy at all. 

Something was odd about this child. 

It was the curiosity in Justice that motivated his next move, as he 
branched out his long, white metal arm, gathering a little energy from 
within himself. 

{Where the heck did he go?} May thought as her charge ended. Her black 
marble eyes looked around for any sign of her enemy. Nothing. But 
then, as May was about to turn around, a bright white-hot light 
surrounded her. May looked up to see what was going on, but before she 
even had the chance, Justice fired a blast of dense energy from the 
palm of his dark hand. May yelped as she was hit by that attack, and 
was knocked backwards slightly by it. That had caught her off guard so 
much that May had to pause herself for just a few seconds to think 
about what just happened.

Without shifting his eyes from May, Justice landed gracefully upon the 
ground. Now he was concerned. A blast like that would have destroyed 
most soldiers the Sacred Order of Holy Knights would have had at their 
disposal. Yet May had taken a full on hit and survived. Not only that 
but she was standing up again. For the most part, Justice could not 
understand why such a young girl was able to resist him like this. 
Until he really thought about it...

{Impossible!} Justice thought in severity. {Could this child be...?  
Japanese?}

Justice looked at the scowl on May&#146;s face as she stood up. The 
resilience, the strength. It all added up. This girl was of pure 
Japanese blood. 

Justice was no less than incredulous. &#147;So...there were...survivors.&#148;

The more the God of Destruction thought about it, the more confusing 
it was. But all at once, it wasn&#146;t all that hard to accept. After 
destroying the lab that had brought him back from the grave, Justice 
had run into that fiery Japanese swordswoman whom he defeated easily. 

Justice clenched his fist as May attempted to attack him once more. If 
this child was truly of Japanese descent, then there was absolutely no 
need for him to hold back.

**********

Millia ran towards Robo Ky, lowly dashing through the high up growth 
of grass just outside of the tower. So far, contending with this 
bucket of bolts had been no great struggle for the disinclined 
assassin. The time had come to finish this little game off. Millia 
still had a date with another mechanical nightmare, high off the upper 
reaches of the tower. This pretending robo-soldier was doing nothing 
more than delaying Justice&#146;s comeuppance. 

As Millia came close to Robo Ky, the young blonde whipped her hair 
into the deadly shape of a blade and made a smooth set of hack and 
slash motions at the android&#146;s already damaged body. The mechanical 
knight let out a strangled robotic cry as Millia&#146;s razor sharp hair 
sliced at his chest and abdomen. Those fierce strikes continued, and 
eventually, Robo Ky&#146;s fake Sacred Order uniform was shredded into tiny 
ribbons. Quickly he waved his sword at Millia, who effectively dodged 
that, to overcome these attacks. 

Robo Ky jumped back to avoid Millia, and launched himself into the 
air. The assassin was proving to be more of a challenge than his data 
first indicated. It was clear that Millia had reached a whole new 
level since his database of info on her had been collected. But 
regardless, Robo Ky still held the edge. The robo-knight crossed his 
metal arms across his body, and assembled some power units from that 
small but potent energy generator within him. Soon he spread out his 
arms, and fired a crescent wave of lightning in a downward trajectory, 
heading straight at Millia. The Russian woman looked up at this. 
Whatever that attack was, it was standard form for Robo Ky. He had 
been using it continuously since the start of this battle. But it was 
different this time. This wave of blue energy was much faster than 
usual. 

Millia employed her brilliant assassin-trained agility to swing her 
whole body to one side, in a dazzling attempt at avoiding such a 
technique. But as the blast collided with the ground, a fierce 
explosion rocked the land, and the subsequent shockwave forced all of 
the balance out of her body. Millia topped over within a cloud of 
smoke created by the impact, batting away traces of ash with her 
hands. That last lightning wave definitely had more &#145;pep&#146; than the 
previous ones. 

But before Millia put stock in that, Robo Ky lunged at her from her 
left. Robo Ky brought down his mighty sword to strike at the Russian, 
but she did not fear it. She formed her hair into the shape of an 
overhanging shield and fended off Robo Ky&#146;s assault. But even so, 
Millia could feel the jolts of electricity passing through her hair. 

Robo Ky was stepping up the game.

As soon as Millia dissolved the form her hair had previously taken, 
Robo Ky threw himself at Millia, knocking the woman out of the dust 
and smoke clouds. Robo Ky reared back the fake Thunderseal, and lunged 
it at Millia&#146;s waist. Millia quickly ducked under the blade and curled 
her body into ball, rolling past Robo Ky&#146;s legs with ease.  She had to 
put some distance between herself and that clunking machine. Millia 
quickly stood up and tried her best to study this situation. But 
before she could, Robo Ky fired another one of his unending arsenal of 
lightning waves. Millia picked up speed and ran out of the way, hoping 
to avoid the shockwaves of Robo Ky&#146;s technique before it hit. No such 
luck. Zato&#146;s nemesis was blown off her feet by the explosion, and Robo 
Ky saw this as his time to attack up front. The android jumped over 
from the reverse of his body, and struck up a cloud of lightning above 
his body as he somersaulted forwards over himself. Millia saw Robo 
Ky&#146;s body descending towards her own, and rolled to one side to avoid 
this. A loud crash echoed into the night as Robo Ky&#146;s legs rammed into 
the grassy ground, streaks of electricity passing along it as well.   

Millia coughed as more dust got into her throat. Something was off 
about this situation. A couple minutes ago, she was smacking Robo Ky 
around like a rag doll. Now he was starting to dominate her. 

But for what reason?

Millia&#146;s winter cold eyes thinned out. &#147;...How is he beating me?&#148;

Robo Ky stood up slowly, that last move had meant his whole body was 
on the line, but it did have pleasurable results. 

&#147;ASSASSIN_MILLIA. I_HAVE_RECORDED_ALL_OF_YOUR_FIGHTING_TECHINQUES. 
YOU_HAVE_NO_CHANCE_IN_DEFEATING_ME. SURRENDER_NOW.&#148;

Millia smirked. &#147;For all your backchat and techno mumbo jumbo, you 
still have no idea about who I really am. I&#146;ve been a recluse for the 
better half of my adult life. Nobody has known isolation like I have. 
And through it all I was hunted down like a miserable dog by a band of 
ruthless poachers. But not once did I surrender to the likes of you. 
You may know me better than anyone one on a physical level...but you 
still have a long way to go if you ever hope to understand the human 
soul.&#148;

&#147;SILENCE!&#148; Robo Ky screamed. &#147;STUN_EDGE!&#148;

Millia ducked over to one side of Robo Ky&#146;s blast. Which was even 
faster than the previous one. But then Millia realized something. Robo 
Ky was not getting stronger. It was his analysis of her that was 
giving him an edge. Something had to be done to put him away. Millia 
ran forwards at Robo Ky, hoping that her superior speed would be 
enough to throw the mechanized brute for a loop. But before Millia 
could get close, Robo Ky made a peculiar hand motion, and crouched 
down while doing so. A good distance from the android, a pulsating 
wave of striking sapphire energy broke out in the molecules of the 
crispy night air. The speed of Millia&#146;s run offered her no hope of 
avoiding this, and she let out a flat grunt of pressure as she slammed 
into that stationary lightning wall. A surge of electricity jolted 
through Millia&#146;s lissom body and out of reflex, Robo Ky seized his 
chance to strike his opponent down. For a slight second, Robo Ky fell 
still. Then lightning strong energy unhurriedly developed around Robo 
Ky&#146;s body, and soon the energy formed into a clear crystalline sphere 
of thunderous electric energy. Four other globes of power subsequently 
surrounded this spherical energy ball. Then without warning, Robo Ky, 
completely surrounded by his lightning shield, sprang at Millia and 
stormed along the cold grasslands.  

Millia was still too dazed from the Ray Divider to see this coming, 
and so more damage was inflicted as Robo Ky&#146;s cruising attack smashed 
against her body. The force was immense but the duration of the attack 
was lacking at best, and a few seconds later, the blonde woman was 
tossed back like so much rubbish. As her tumbling body stopped moving, 
Millia gritted her teeth and curled her left arm around her body. 

Internal damage had been done. And Robo Ky was not finished yet.

**********

&#147;Arrgh!!&#148;

May yelled out as the firm back of Justice&#146;s iron fist struck her. Her 
pirate hat was blown right off her head, and May fell to her knees, 
with a superior Justice standing before her. She couldn&#146;t believe it. 
May had been kicking butt since she was a kid. Everybody on the crew 
had said before that she was freakishly strong. But compared to 
Justice, all of that meant nothing. 

Droplets of sweat fell from May&#146;s face onto the cold, withered floor. 
Never before had May put this much effort into fighting one person, it 
was a very rare occurrence for her to be this angry. All of this anger 
was fuelling her. But moreover, Dizzy was the real issue. It wasn&#146;t 
until recently that May had realized just how much Dizzy meant to her. 
All the feelings of love and attraction were never really acknowledged 
until now. 

May&#146;s heartbeat went up faster and faster, but not from her fight with 
Justice. In her eyes...her dark marble eyes, reflections of Dizzy ran 
rampant. Through separation, breathes the realizations of necessity. 
May started to fully understand the depths of her caring for Dizzy. 
Images of the young Gear doing anything...anything at all. They were 
worth something to May. To see Dizzy laugh, smile, speak. Even cry if 
need be. They all warranted a reaction from May. And they all 
reflected a section of May&#146;s heart that could only be understood by 
Dizzy herself. 

May loved Dizzy with every inch of her being. And right now, the only 
thing stopping them from being together was Justice. And it was that 
thought that gave May the courage, strength and patience to continue 
to fight. As long as Dizzy needed to be protected, May would be there 
to carry it out. 

May slowly drew in breath, and weakly placed her arms on the ground. 
Though her vision was blurry, May was sure that she could do this. 
Exploiting all the strength she had left in her body, May slowly stood 
on her feet, and clasped onto the anchor at her side. Justice just 
stared at this young Japanese girl. Even for a Japanese woman, she was 
extremely determined.    

But there was a fine line between determination and arrogance. 

Justice sneered. &#147;Your fight is over, child. Go to sleep.&#148;

In spite of the bleak situation she was in, May managed to form a grin 
from her lips and pulled her anchor over her head, to rest on her 
supple shoulders. 

&#147;I&#146;m not...giving up...&#148; May said defiantly. &#147;...Not until you...let 
Dizzy go...&#148;

Justice felt a feeling certain humans call as bewilderment. Since the 
moment of his creation he had never actually seen or heard of a human 
fighting to &#145;help&#146; a Gear.

&#147;Why?&#148; The Bio-technical weapon asked. &#147;Why would you risk your life 
to save that of a Gear?&#148;
 
May scowled like she had just been asked the stupidest of all 
questions. &#147;Because I love her!&#148; The pirate girl shouted. &#147;I won&#146;t let 
you take her away from me!&#148;

Justice was still clouded by such revelations. &#147;You are...in love with 
a...Gear?&#148; He asked, still confused by such talk. 

But whatever Justice&#146;s feelings on the situation where, May could not 
care any less than she already did. In a flash, the muscles in May&#146;s 
body tensed and contracted and her feet streamlined across the dusty 
carpeted ground.

&#147;Let her go!&#148; May bellowed. 

Justice sensed the keen boost in May&#146;s momentum, and brought his arm 
to one side of his body. Although he really didn&#146;t think he needed 
this much energy to defeat May, Justice had seen the kind of powers 
that the Japanese had employed during the Crusades. It would be 
foolish to underestimate this child on the basis of her innocence. 
Glittering traces of energy surrounded Justice&#146;s sharpened hand, 
building up power for the next motion to come. Just as May got near 
enough to strike Justice, the Gear King violently dragged his arm 
around his body, and spread it in the region of his mechanical frame 
in a circular motion. A thin wave of azure blue energy sleekly cut 
through the night air, and struck harshly into May&#146;s lower abdomen. 

The young girl screamed in pain and things just went black and white 
for May at that point. From the moment of impact, from the instant 
Justice&#146;s attack made contact with her flesh, she took in just how big 
the gap between her power and that of Justice really was. Though she 
wasn&#146;t really aware of it, May was tossed clear across the one hundred 
steps of the stairway to heaven. In seconds her weakened body slammed 
against Dizzy&#146;s ice prison, the sickening blood from her mouth 
splattering against the glass-like frost. Though May had lost a sense 
of her surroundings, she could still manage to remember just whom she 
was protecting. And as a result, a wave of shame and hurt passed 
through the brunette. Of course the pain was physical, but there was 
also a deeper pain. A pain within May&#146;s heart.

A heart-wrenching pain that existed simply because she couldn&#146;t defend 
Dizzy. 

That was the reason May came to China. To defend Dizzy from anything. 
But when it really mattered, May did not have the potential to protect 
her beloved Dizzy. 

Shining dewdrop tears shone through the air as May&#146;s body slowly fell 
through the air and landed crudely on the ground. May could only 
mumble a few words as the last of her energy left her. 

&#147;...Oh...Dizzy...I&#146;m...so...sorry...&#148;

May&#146;s energy was depleted. That was it. That was her limit. And 
Justice slowly advanced on her. 

&#147;It sickens me to think there are survivors...&#148; He said hatefully. &#147;I 
will have to eliminate you, human...Japanese human.&#148;

Unbeknownst to anyone, even Justice, Dizzy was not unconscious. Not in 
the least. Somehow she had woken up during Justice&#146;s battle with Ky 
Kiske, and had been watching everything that had taken place since 
then. It was tough to watch any of it; Dizzy had always been adverse 
to violence, but what truly horrified her was Justice&#146;s treatment of 
May.

Sweet, innocent, loving May.

Someone who had done nothing but protect others and had done her best 
for her crew. Justice had treated May like she was nothing more than 
soiled dirt. Like her life meant nothing. Never before had Dizzy seen 
such cruelty, not even by the human people who verbally abused her in 
Spain. That was the act of insecure, frightened people. Justice&#146;s 
actions were inexcusable. 

And he was not finished as it was. Justice stepped towards May&#146;s 
comatose body, stamping his large ashen metallic foot on her pirate 
hat as he neared her.  

Even though Dizzy could not move in her ice prison, she could see 
quite well what was going on around her, and tears welled up in 
Dizzy&#146;s crimson eyes as she saw May&#146;s blood stain the outside of the 
glassy ice. 

Dizzy couldn&#146;t take it. No more. No more suffering. 

On the outside, Justice stepped towards May, and brought his single 
fist into the air. The path of humankind had to be liquidated. And the 
only way to do this...was genocide. 

Whilst Justice was about to bring an end to the young pirate, he 
stopped himself and looked at the ground. There was a slight tremor 
passing through the stairway to heaven. The fragmented shards of 
rubble and smashed statues littered around the area were also shaking. 
Soon the sound of this shaking reached Justice, and the smaller rocks 
on the ground rose and fell, just like that. 

Justice was unable to explain what was going there. Something was 
obviously gathering power and was doing it quickly, almost in urgency. 
There was a presence within this area that was unlocking its 
influence. The Gear commander let speculation take over, and hastily 
looked back over at Sol. From the looks of it, he was still out cold. 
And just a short distance away from Sol was Ky, who was also out of 
it. 

So if it wasn&#146;t either of those two or the Japanese girl...then...

Justice swerved his head back around to look up at the gates, or more 
specifically, the ice prison containing Dizzy. And correct to 
Justice&#146;s suppositions, the icy cage holding Dizzy prisoner was 
cracking apart. Through each new streaky crack in the ice, a new beam 
of light shone all the way through, beaming across the grim setting. 
Then, without so much as a forewarning, the light being emitted from 
Dizzy shattered her ice prison, filling the skies with scorching hot 
white light, forcing Justice to cover himself as masses of dust, ice 
shards and stone were tossed along the stairway. 

Then, amidst the burning light, Dizzy&#146;s unhindered sylvan form graced 
the stairway to heaven, her wings in their full span, adorned in light 
like an unholy Angel of Redemption.  

Slowly her feet touched the cold floor following the dissolving of the 
illumination and Dizzy&#146;s teary red eyes directed themselves towards 
her one true love. 

And the dark figure standing across from her. 

The &#145;Queen of Gears&#146; came face to face with the King.

**********

Testament sneered deviously at Johnny. To be filled such a power, the 
heightened power of a fully functional humanoid Gear was no less than 
an unimaginable thrill to the senses. To be in touch with one&#146;s 
surroundings. To be able to feel every single vein pumping blood. To 
feel every molecule scattered across the body, filling with fervent 
clout and vigour.  

These were the gifts of a Gear. A higher link on the evolutionary 
chain than any human could be. In every way possible, Gears were 
superior to humans. And every time Testament looked at bastard human 
filth like Johnny, this fact was brought back to his mind with 
disturbing speed. 

Testament pointed his scythe at Johnny. &#147;Your kind have walked along 
the earth for too long, human! The time has come for a purification of 
this planet. Everything within the world has become foul and rotten. 
This is nothing more than the result of mankind&#146;s corruption. The 
disease of humankind which plagues the earth...must be destroyed! It 
is my duty. The Gears might be nothing more than an extension of your 
existence, but I believe...that we are the next stage of earth&#146;s 
continual evolution.&#148;

Johnny scowled, as rare as it was for him to do that. &#147;What are you 
talking about?&#148;

&#147;To grow and thrive is the indomitable function of this planet. But 
when humanity was born, it signalled the birth of a dangerous parasite 
that threatens that equilibrium. Fooled into believing that it could 
sustain its life and that of humanity, the earth accepted this 
development. But the earth was not strong enough to protect itself 
from humankind&#146;s darkness and so it was almost crushed. From that 
time, the earth realized that humans were unfit to claim dominion over 
the earth. They were too selfish and self-absorbed to even think that 
their actions had an effect on the earth. No matter how miniscule. 
From that realization, destiny gave birth to a highly developed life 
form called Gears. Beings that could fight humanity on an equal 
playing field. We were chosen to reclaim the world from human scum 
like you. It is my destiny to protect the earth from your kind&#146;s evil. 
Humanity is the enemy of life!&#148;

Johnny shook his head. &#147;You&#146;re right. Human people are selfish. We are 
cold, we are egocentric. But does that give you any right to force 
your own wishes on the world?&#148;

&#147;Silence, human!&#148; Testament leapt into the air and, brought his scythe 
to the side of his body. Then, starting from a circular motion 
downwards, Testament swung his scythe around in spin, slashing at 
Johnny&#146;s presence. 

Johnny grabbed the edge of his hat and moved to one side of 
Testament&#146;s attack. He was pretty sure now that Justice had full 
control over him. But Testament&#146;s caring for Dizzy might be just the 
way to reach him. Still, Johnny placed a defensive hand on the hilt of 
his sword. He didn&#146;t want to have to hurt Testament since Dizzy did 
care for him, but if he had to, Johnny would finish it. 

&#147;You think that&#146;s what Dizzy wants, huh?&#148; Johnny said sternly. &#147;To 
fight and kill? Battling in some crazy war that will bring her nothing 
but pain and anguish?&#148;

Testament yelled out again, just before bowing in respect. Johnny was 
curious about Testament&#146;s sudden change in attitude, and studied the 
Gear for a second. There was a hateful grin at the side of his mouth. 
Then that horrible sound of a ground-borne demon buzzed in his ears. 
Johnny quickly moved to one side as the demon beast tore up the steps 
of the staircase they were standing on. Johnny swiftly jumped back to 
avoid it and stared Testament. 

&#147;How dare you say that girl&#146;s name?&#148; Testament snarled. &#147;Your people 
have done nothing but bully and terrorize an innocent heart that 
wished for nothing more than a quiet existence. She knows and feels 
the pain brought along by human inconsideration. Dizzy is superior to 
you in every way!&#148;

Johnny sneered. &#147;You still didn&#146;t answer the question. Do think that 
would make her happy? Acting as Justice&#146;s lapdog? Living a life of 
destruction and warfare? Well I don&#146;t think so. This might sound rude, 
but...I don&#146;t think that&#146;s what she wants out of life. I think she 
just wants to live her life as a normal girl.&#148;

Testament said naught, but stepped forwards slowly, and waved his free 
his hand in the air, eliciting a curious sound. Like a puncture of 
flesh. Johnny maintained his guard, kept his blue eyes trained on 
Testament&#146;s movements. 

Testament stood still, seemingly dropping his guard. Whether this was 
a rouse or not, Johnny didn&#146;t care, Testament was bent on killing him 
no matter what he did. Johnny ran toward the former knight, and pulled 
at the hilt of his sleek blade by just a fraction of a millimetre. But 
as Johnny came close enough to land a blow, he ran into a web of 
sorts. 

It was like a bloody net in the shape of a mesh, which held Johnny 
tight with the sticky substance it was coated with. Johnny gritted his 
teeth as he struggled to wrench himself loose, and this became even 
more desperate when he saw Testament making certain actions. 

The former knight bowed for respect once again, and then stamped his 
hand into the ground, screaming Nightmare Circular. The action 
unbolted a fissure in the channels of time and space, seemingly 
opening a gateway to the unholy underworld itself. Johnny blinked in 
shock as blood red spirits of the dead stormed against his body, 
knocking him out of the bloody web and down the staircase. As Johnny 
tumbled down those stairs, Testament stared downhill at him with his 
eyes full of dark loathing. 

&#147;That blast was full of the angry cries and wails of the dead, human. 
You heard them for a split second and it had the force to rend your 
soul. I hear those voices everyday. I hear them when I sleep, and I 
feel their agony as I draw in breath. They cry out for an end to your 
race. And an end to their suffering. I will not fail the spirits of 
the dead, human.&#148;   

Johnny smirked, wiping the blood from the side of his face. And slowly 
a grin trailed on Johnny&#146;s visage. Despite all the fighting, his 
spirit would never die. 

&#147;Heh...&#148; Johnny scoffed, not even bothering to get up. &#147;Those cries 
are for peace. And you should know that. Because Dizzy has that same 
cry.&#148;

**********

Dizzy rushed over to May. Not caring how Justice felt about it, Dizzy 
quickly went to her love&#146;s side and checked to see her condition. 
After rubbing the bangs from her forehead, and checking her pulse, 
Dizzy confirmed that May was okay. She had taken a beating, but May 
was more or less fine. Dizzy smiled brightly, a few of her tears 
dropping on to May&#146;s shredded orange uniform. 

The innocent Gear had no idea what she would do with herself if 
anything ever happened to May. Justice looked curiously at Dizzy and 
May. It was just so confusing for him. How could a Gear and a 
human...be in love? 

Humans hate Gears and Gears are superior to humans. They are natural 
&#145;Shukuteki&#146;. Nothing could or would change that. So how was it that 
these two, human and Gear, could act in such a manner? It was one of 
the few things that Justice could not get his head around. And for 
that reason...he was driven to know more. 

&#147;Child...why do you comfort the human girl?&#148; Justice asked. 

Dizzy looked over her shoulder, tears staining her eyes, May&#146;s blood 
coving her hands. &#147;How could you do such things to May? She is so kind 
and caring...she came all this way...put her life on the line to 
protect me...I love her...why would you want to do something to hurt 
that? To hurt her?&#148;

Justice shook his head. &#147;Your experiences with the human in this time 
of peace has made you blind to them. To their true desires. It is 
regrettable...but understandable.&#148;

Dizzy looked curiously at Justice, just for a second. It felt...very 
unusual but, Dizzy got an awfully nostalgic tingling when she looked 
at the other commander Gear. It was like looking into a dim mirror. 
Something was there...but Dizzy couldn&#146;t place it. But what she knew 
she felt, was disgust. When human people called her a second Justice, 
it hurt Dizzy a lot. But she knew in her heart that she was nothing 
like him. Justice only saw his true purpose and self-being within his 
weapon body. Violence is justified if that is what you were made to 
do. But to Dizzy that was simply an excuse. Nothing justified death, 
killing and destruction. No living being, human or Gear, had the right 
to crush anything they so chose to do. And as long as Dizzy had life 
and breath within her, there was no way she would allow Justice to 
continue his rampage, despite of the reason.  

Dizzy placed the sweetest of kisses upon her May&#146;s cheek, and got to 
her feet slowly, turning to face Justice, her dim reflection. 

&#147;You have no right to shape the world to the way you chose.&#148; Dizzy 
said. &#147;You cannot stamp through life as though it were a toy to be 
used at your whim. You do not have that right!&#148;

Justice closely inspected Dizzy through his eyes. &#147;It is humanity that 
I seek to destroy, young one. Life itself is a thing to cherish. I do 
not deny that.&#148;

Dizzy tried to hold back her tears. &#147;So then why...? Why would you 
attack innocent people? People who do nothing but care for each other? 
It makes no sense...&#148;

Justice felt himself become enraged. &#147;It makes every bit of sense! I 
am a weapon...I was designed to destroy, and so I do. It is the fabric 
of my being! We are Gears! What consequence does their fate have on 
us? My mission...is genocide. And I exist...no, I function only to 
achieve that mission.&#148;

Dizzy wiped the tears from her eyes. Though her body was shaking, her 
throat sore, and her body cold, the young girl knew what she had to 
do. Justice had to be stopped once and for all. Otherwise, more 
innocent people, just like May were sure to suffer. Justice looked at 
Dizzy. There was a new austerity in her eyes. Whatever resolution she 
had come to in her mind, she was deathly serious about it. 

&#147;I cannot allow you to proceed any further!&#148; Dizzy declared. &#147;As a 
person...I...I will not tolerate it!&#148;

Justice shook his head. He was curious about this girl&#146;s power and 
would have liked for her to join his side, but her mind had become 
polluted by the taint of human influence. Such a flaw does not a good 
soldier make. At any rate, Dizzy&#146;s power had to be quashed. For the 
good of Justice&#146;s mission, this young Gear had to meet her fate. 

Justice slowly crouched over and then leaned back, opening the 
compartments over his shoulders. Two hot discharges of steam leaked 
out from them, and Justice stood back up. To do battle with a fellow 
Gear was always something of an honor. 

Wasting no time, the energy chargers over Justice&#146;s shoulders powered 
up and propelled Justice forward at Dizzy. He instantly brought his 
fist up and stuck it straight ahead, in a stabbing motion. Dizzy saw 
this, and zoomed to one side of Justice, before he could hit her. 
Justice slid a few metres away, and then Dizzy stole the opportunity 
to make her attack. She respectfully stood on guard as Necro 
materialized from his dark wing form, and projected a spinning staff, 
surrounded by flaming blue energy. Justice looked back, behind him. 
That unusual attack was slow moving but had the capacity to do some 
damage. Fearing what might happen if he didn&#146;t act, the King of Gears 
tossed his body upwards slightly and back flipped, thrashing his tail 
around the path of his movements in a rounded shift. This created an 
upward shooting jolt of lightning, of which Dizzy&#146;s attack knocked 
into. 

Justice slid back a little on all fours and watched Dizzy&#146;s movements. 
She was unsuited to fighting, that was for sure. Whatever her power, 
if she lacked the skill to properly use it then she was no real threat 
at all. Still, Justice would not underestimate the girl. The Gear 
commander dashed forwards once more, heading directly for Dizzy. 

{If he is allowed to get any closer, I might not be able to stop his 
attacks.} Dizzy thought pensively. {I have to keep him away.} 

Knowing this to be true, Dizzy leaned forwards and let Undine emerge 
from her light wing form. The young Gear crossed her arms as a symbol 
of intent, and Undine neatly spread her arms out, summoning the cold 
braces of ice and frost to her aid. Immediately a jagged javelin-like 
ice spike shot up from the scarlet-carpeted ground. In the nick of 
time, Justice stopped himself from being impaled by such a force, and 
halted in his steps. 

Justice simply scowled at the thing, and made three sleek, sharp 
chopping motions with the hand of his one arm. The ice spike was cut 
into four even pieces, all of which shattered the second they hit the 
ground. Dizzy blinked. Never before had she seen anyone resist her 
power like this. Something was just not right. However Justice did not 
allow Dizzy to mentally think about that, and charged at the 
cerulean-haired girl. Dizzy was far too unprepared to effectively 
think up a counter to this act and gasped as Justice&#146;s tail struck the 
side of her ribs. Dizzy stumbled to one side, grasping her ribs as she 
was pushed to one side. Type-01 wasted no time waiting, and struck 
Dizzy once again, with the back of his fist. Dizzy felt the air being 
knocked out of her as Justice&#146;s shadowy iron fist hammered her lower 
stomach. The young Gear desperately drew in air, and toppled onto her 
knees. 

Justice just looked at Dizzy. She did have some incredible strength, 
but her command of it was deficient. 

&#147;I am in awe of she who can utilize such power.&#148; Justice uttered 
conceitedly. &#147;But are you controlling it or is it controlling you, 
young Gear?&#148;

Dizzy desperately gathered in air. She was not up to fighting like 
this. The sheer force of her power was enough to see off most people, 
but against fighters such as Justice and Sol, brute strength was not 
enough. She was not accustomed to this kind of fighting. Dizzy lacked 
the proficiency to manipulate her powers in the way that Justice 
could. But there was still a way to win. Necro was in no way as timid 
or as unskilled as Dizzy was. If she took a chance and let him have 
control for a short while, it might tip the scales. But Dizzy was 
hesitant. Not only would it cause her a great deal of pain, but also 
Necro could be dangerous if he was out of control. Nevertheless, 
Justice was a greater threat right here and now. And he hurt May. 

That was the one thing Dizzy could not forgive. 

Gradually, Dizzy pulled herself back onto her feet, and stood off 
against her fellow Gear. Then, for a split second, Dizzy renounced the 
control she had over her body, and gave all of it to Necro. Dizzy&#146;s 
dark guardian wrapped his spiritual form around Dizzy&#146;s body, and from 
that second, the body of the beautiful Gear was flashing with a 
supreme dark radiance. Dizzy&#146;s head lulled slightly as it ended, but 
it arose straight back, with the darkest of grins attached onto her 
face. Necro now had full control. 

Justice was wordless. Such a change in disposition was rather odd to 
him. Although it didn&#146;t worry him. Until...

A Necro-installed Dizzy spread her nimble arms out even to both sides 
of her body, and instantaneously an unstable wave of miniature 
volcanic explosions erupted along the ground. Justice roared as the 
volatile molten blasts surrounded and ravaged his already maimed body. 
The shock of such an attack prevented Justice from focusing properly, 
as Dizzy jumped through the clouds of smoke surrounding him. Dizzy&#146;s 
darker wing wrapped around her hand, and made a slashing motion at 
Justice with unbelievable strength. The chest plate of the Gear leader 
was chipped directly on contact with Dizzy&#146;s boisterous fist, and he 
screamed out a second time as another one rammed into his abdomen, 
piercing his battle suit. A short second later, Dizzy&#146;s hand 
reappeared as it cleaved through the small of Justice&#146;s back, covered 
in scrap metal, electricity and a black substance some might regard as 
blood. With a cruel smile, Necro-Dizzy roughly ripped out the hand 
impaling Justice&#146;s torso in addition to shoving him backwards with a 
violent push. Justice lurched backwards, holding his gaping wound with 
his only arm. 

{Where...did the child get this power from!?} Justice thought 
urgently. 

Dizzy didn&#146;t wait for Justice to make his comeback assault, and 
gathered up power in her hand. The connections between Gears run deep 
and Justice was about to learn just how immense that depth really was. 
Slowly, almost mechanically, Dizzy swung her arm around and over her 
body, but while doing so, Necro&#146;s wing wrapped around the arm once 
more. This formed a gigantic blade, so heavy and so powerful that 
Necro-Dizzy had to hold onto her arm to maintain control. The ancient 
scripted blade cut through the air itself, producing a golden wave of 
energy to strike Justice down. The King of Gears let out a frustrated 
cry from seeing that. Dizzy&#146;s attack distinctly resembled his Michael 
Sword. But rather than waste time thinking about it, Justice drew back 
his arm and swung it around his body in a similar way to Dizzy, 
creating his own wave of power. The two energy bolts collided with 
each other, sending powerful shockwaves across the stairway to heaven. 
As the light died down, Justice observed Dizzy. She was further away 
than she had been before. But then he looked at his feet. There were 
two trails; both of his feet were in one of them. Although Justice had 
defended against Dizzy&#146;s assault, he had been pressed back like a 
feather. 

Justice could not understand how the girl attained such power so 
quickly. He was sure that her strength had not increased; when Sol 
unlocked his true potential Justice could feel it. So then how...? How 
could Dizzy raise her power like this?

Then it hit him. {She didn&#146;t increase her power...} Justice thought. 
{She focused it! This is the true scope of her abilities...}

Justice snarled. Now there was no way he could allow this girl to 
live. Daigyakusatsu no Kami bent over forwards, crossing his arms over 
his body. If Dizzy&#146;s strength was allowed to exist within the world, 
there was no telling the kind of damage she could do to Justice&#146;s 
overall plan. Justice pulled together some of his spare energy, 
gathering and focussing this power in the compartments over his 
shoulders. Necro-Dizzy decided not to wait for the outcome of 
Justice&#146;s activities, but as she glided towards him, it became 
apparent that she was too late. Justice screeched once more as the 
dual partitions unlocked themselves and a masterful blast of pure 
white energy stormed out from within them. Necro-Dizzy grimaced at the 
blast and raised her hands to protect herself. The Gear cried in agony 
as the heat from Justice&#146;s powerful energy surge burned at her senses. 
Dizzy had to sharply close her eyes to prevent herself from being 
blinded by the awesome light. Tensing her muscles and pushing her left 
leg back was still not enough to fully defend against this power and 
Dizzy was forced rearward by it. 

Dizzy was smashed into one of the few standing statues left in the 
stairway to heaven and when the beam subsided, Dizzy&#146;s limp body 
crashed onto the ground, smoke and dust covering her over. 

Justice made a sound that sounded like panting, and lowed himself to 
one knee. He wasn&#146;t sure how long he could keep this up. Nearly all of 
his energy had been used up in his battles with Ky, Sol, May and 
Dizzy. But from the looks of it, Dizzy wasn&#146;t going to be getting up 
anytime soon. 

Necro freed Dizzy&#146;s body from his control; he was no longer able to 
prolong his command without doing serious damage to her. Then as Dizzy 
regained her senses, she realized how tired she was. That last attack 
from Justice took it out of her. If things went on like this, she was 
sure to die. But Dizzy was just so exhausted...

Tears welled up in Dizzy&#146;s eyes again when the sweet memories of her 
time as a Jellyfish Pirate returned to her. &#147;I&#146;m sorry...everyone. I 
am...just so tired of it all...I cannot...defeat him...&#148;

Justice looked over at Dizzy&#146;s body. She wasn&#146;t moving, but she was 
still alive. He had to finish her off now, before anything could get 
in the way. One more direct hit from the Gamma Ray and Dizzy would be 
blown into oblivion. So again Justice bent over and assembled all the 
last scraps of power his body contained.  

The few speckles of her tears pattered on the floor, and with her 
sullen feelings of guilt and shame, Dizzy slowly lost consciousness.

**********

Dizzy looked around her environment. She was...floating. In a 
shapeless void, nothing around her but emptiness. In a colourless, 
faceless, forever shifting voice. Dizzy shut her eyes.

ISOLATION 

That hateful feeling. The feeling of being alone. One thing I disliked 
was being alone. Especially now that I have experienced what it meant 
to have true friends. But...was the isolation where I really felt 
comfortable? Were having friends too much of a...

FEAR

Do I...fear letting them down? I...don&#146;t know...I am careful about 
it...I hate the idea of them being angry with me...but...I do not want 
to be afraid of them...they are my...

TRUST

I trust them...I love them...they have made me feel so welcomed on the 
May ship...I can never forget their kindness. They have real 
strength...I...am a Gear...is that all I exist as? A Gear? Or do I 
mean more? Should I mean more?

&#147;If you&#146;re asking the question, it shows that you know you&#146;re worth 
much more!&#148;

Dizzy looked around. To one side of her. Standing there were June and 
April. Her friends...two close friends who she felt she didn&#146;t 
deserve. Friends that had been so kind to her...

Dizzy struggled to hold back her tears. &#147;I don&#146;t deserve you.&#148;

June rested her hand on her waist, and shook her head. &#147;What are you 
talking about? You&#146;re our friend, Diz! Now and forever! Come on, win 
this one for the team!&#148;

Dizzy looked over at April. She was equally confident. &#147;I believe in 
you, Dizzy. We all do.&#148;

Over on the other side of Dizzy, both Johnny and Testament appeared. 
Dizzy looked at the two of them. Her protectors. The people that went 
out of their way to defend her. 

&#147;Johnny...&#148; Dizzy said quietly. &#147;...and Testament...&#148;

Johnny winked at Dizzy from behind his shades. &#147;It&#146;s all up to you 
now, cakes. Don&#146;t let us down.&#148;

Testament looked at Dizzy, with that same cold but caring expression. 
&#147;Ascend to new heights, my precious one.&#148;

Then Dizzy turned her attentions to the woman that was in front of 
her. Her first real friend. The only girl who she felt comfortable 
with no matter how she felt...

The girl she loved. &#147;...May...&#148;

May smiled brightly, and drifted forwards toward Dizzy, clasping the 
scarlet-eyed girl&#146;s hand, and rubbing her tears away with her other 
one. 

&#147;There&#146;s no need to be sad.&#148; May said sweetly. &#147;I&#146;m here for you. I 
know you can do this...because we are connected. We have been since we 
first met. I feel what you feel, you see what I see. I&#146;m in love with 
you, Dizzy. I don&#146;t want you to ever believe that we don&#146;t have faith 
in you.&#148;

Dizzy smiled a little bit. &#147;...May.&#148;

&#147;Now...&#148; May started. &#147;Get up and show that walking tin can what a 
Jellyfish Pirate is made of...&#148; 

**********

Justice continued to charge up the final attack that would put Dizzy 
away for good. Her power was phenomenal, but under the raw strength 
and cunning of Justice, all that power meant nothing. Justice then 
snorted as he saw Dizzy move. The young Gear, struggling to stand on 
her hands and knees, was slowly getting up. 

Justice was able to speak, even though he was building energy for his 
final attack. &#147;How can you have any power left?&#148;

Dizzy hauled herself to her feet. She wasn&#146;t scared anymore. There was 
no need to be. She had her friends, April, June, Johnny, Testament all 
by her side. And what mattered most, was the fact that she had May&#146;s 
love in her heart. With those tender feelings of affection giving her 
strength, there was no way she could lose. 

Not now, not ever. 

&#147;Fine then young Gear!&#148; Justice bellowed. &#147;Your tenacity will be 
greatly accepted in the netherworld!!&#148; 

Without further ado, the twin compartments over Justice&#146;s broad 
mechanical shoulders separated and opened up, firing another 
gargantuan blast of destructive force. Dizzy did not move or flinch. 
To look at her, you would have never guessed that any sort of change 
had occurred within the young woman but there had been. 

Dizzy was not afraid anymore. 

As long as she had the support of her friends and her love, nothing on 
this earth could stand against her. And Dizzy at last understood that. 
As the energy ray came near to her, Dizzy calmly set her hands forward 
and held the blast back. Though the energy of it was scorching hot, 
Dizzy&#146;s power had reached a whole new level. And she had finally the 
control to use it. The innocent Gear held the blast firm, even as the 
ground started to shake once more, cracking the foundation of the 
tower. Justice forced more strength into the Gamma Ray when he 
realized that Dizzy was shielding herself almost effortlessly, but it 
was not enough. Justice was too tired and Dizzy&#146;s power was growing by 
the second. Slowly, Dizzy began to step forwards, pushing Justice&#146;s 
energy beam back as she moved. He could not believe it. This child was 
resisting his attack even though she should have been drained of all 
her energy. 

Before long, Dizzy&#146;s hand moved away from the beam and fell to her 
side. Now the only thing standing between Dizzy and destruction was 
the raw force of her dominant Gear aura. Like the shield that defends 
the soul of a person, Dizzy&#146;s shining white aura held Justice&#146;s attack 
at bay. And with one final resolution, her feet began to slowly rise 
from the floor. 

This had to end. 

The lightning bolts and thunder claps in the dark night skies of 
Fuzhou took on a deeper pitch as a powerful new force began to emerge 
from the depths of destiny. Dizzy screamed while a mighty force filled 
her body. Streaks of golden power flowed through her veins and all the 
wounds and bruises on her body just disappeared, almost as if they 
were never there. Dizzy continued to rise until she reached a certain 
point above the ground. Then her body was enveloped with nothing but 
white light and she discharged everything her bright soul could 
muster. Instantly Justice&#146;s energy beam was dissolved under the 
absolute pandemonium of Dizzy&#146;s chaotic power. Rays of light 
overflowed the stairway to heaven, shining into the night skies as 
bright as any star could ever be. Justice shrieked while he was 
blasted by Dizzy&#146;s ultimate strength. As easily this, parts of 
Justice&#146;s body began to melt and erode away; the force of Dizzy&#146;s soul 
was like a corrosive acid. And it was then that Justice understood. 

He was going to die. 

But even more than that, the King of Gears saw the untouched purity of 
a mighty Gear&#146;s power. And as a result...visions of That Man, the Gear 
Maker, flooded through Justice&#146;s thoughts, just as they had done a 
year ago. And he fully appreciated the meaning of them.  

{Incredible...the true power of a Gear.} Justice thought. {I see...so 
that is...the next chapter, is it? Then my presence...it is not at all 
necessary...I see. Then I won&#146;t interfere. To die now...by the fist of 
a Gear...is...acceptable.}

With a final shaky rattle, Justice, the leader and commander of the 
former Gear army, met his final end. 

**********

Johnny held firm. Though he was losing ground to Testament, he was not 
going to give up. Though Johnny did wonder just how long he could keep 
this up without actually hurting Testament. 

Soon the dark scythe wielding Gear reared over Johnny with his 
foreboding presence, and pulled his weapon high above his head. Johnny 
was not going to attack just yet, but kept his hand on his blade. 

&#147;Now human!&#148; Testament said. &#147;Feel the agony of a thousand souls 
of...of...&#148;

The former knight dropped his blood tipped weapon, and slowly fell to 
the ground. Johnny looked at him with a puzzled appearance on his 
face. 

&#147;What happened?&#148; He asked. &#147;Did he...no...I don&#146;t believe it...&#148;

Johnny couldn&#146;t hide his good cheer and smiled. &#147;Someone killed 
Justice!&#148;

**********

Millia blinked as Robo Ky came closer and closer to her. Her ankle had 
been damaged by one of Robo Ky&#146;s lightning waves. This robotic faker 
had successful predicted all of her moves and abilities. It appeared 
that he wasn&#146;t lying when he said Millia was outmatched. Now that 
machine was going to destroy her. 

Millia looked away as Robo Ky advanced on her. All of her struggles 
against Zato and the Guild, she had overcome them all. Yet the final 
story would be concluded by a soulless android. 

Robo Ky lifted the false Thunderseal into the air to strike down a now 
helpless Millia Rage. &#147;YOUR_FATE_IS_SEALED.&#148;

&#147;Fuujin!&#148;

&#147;Youzansen!&#148; 

Robo Ky yelled out as two attackers damaged the back of his body, and 
the robotic nightmare went sailing over across the grass into a nearby 
rock, smashing its metal cranium. 

Millia looked up from the ground she was lying on. To the cheery 
smiles of Baiken Seishino and Anji Mito. Millia couldn&#146;t believe that. 
They came to rescue her?

&#147;B-Baiken?&#148; Millia stuttered, partly from her shock, and also from her 
fight with Robo Ky. &#147;What are you doing here?&#148;

Baiken simply smiled, and Anji walked over to give Millia a hand up. 

&#147;Baiken just wouldn&#146;t stop nagging me until we came over here to help 
you out. We would have been here sooner but we didn&#146;t know where you 
had gotten. Until we got some help from that Axl guy.&#148; 

Millia clasped onto Anji&#146;s and let him help her up. &#147;Thank you. Both 
of you...&#148; Millia turned her attention to Baiken. &#147;But you were 
injured. Why did you risk hurting yourself again?&#148;

Baiken ignored the twinge she felt at her waist. &#147;I decided not to let 
you have all the fun. I guess I missed most of the party though, eh?&#148;

The Japanese swordswoman began to walk over to her friends, until the 
pain from the injuries that Justice had inflicted set in. Baiken 
groaned and staggered a little, until Millia and Anji rushed to her 
side as best they could. 

The blonde assassin and the inquisitive fan carrier stopped Baiken 
from falling, holding both sides of her. For now, Millia forgot about 
her beaten ankle. &#147;Baiken, are you alright?&#148;

Baiken nodded, not really looking up. &#147;...Yes...I&#146;m fine.&#148;

&#147;Sure, sis?&#148; Anji asked. 

Again, Baiken simply nodded. &#147;Yes...thank you both.&#148;

Both Millia and Anji smiled. Baiken had changed a little. Normally she 
would have just told you to let her go, but now she was accepting 
help. Then as they both thought about that, Millia and Anji&#146;s 
attentions turned to each other. 

{What exactly *is* Baiken&#146;s connection to this man?} Millia thought 
curiously. And surprisingly enough, Anji&#146;s thoughts weren&#146;t much 
different. {What exactly *is* Baiken&#146;s connection to this woman?} 

**********

&#147;Uuuughh...&#148;

May groaned loudly, her ebony eyes opening up slowly. From the looks 
of things, she had been out of it for a while. Then she remembered the 
fight. Justice...and Dizzy...

May looked behind her. The ice prison that Dizzy had been inside of 
had been crushed. Then May looked around desperately for Dizzy. If 
Justice wasn&#146;t here, then that meant he might have left again, taking 
Dizzy with him. Just when May started to panic again, the pirate took 
a look across from her, just down the one hundred stepped stairway. 

&#147;Dizzy!&#148; May yelled. 

The young girl ran erratically to Dizzy, who was lying asleep on the 
dusty ground with a withered blanket covering over her. May slid to a 
stop when she reached her girlfriend, and kneeled down to check that 
she was okay. 

Luckily, she was. &#147;Thank god...she&#146;s okay.&#148;

&#147;She needs rest.&#148;

May looked behind to see Sol standing just behind her. &#147;Who are you? 
Did you take care of Justice?&#148;

Sol said nothing. There wasn&#146;t a shred left of Type-01. Justice was 
well and truly dead. Even though he hadn&#146;t seen any of it, Sol was 
pretty sure that Dizzy had been the one to take him down. 

&#147;Well?&#148; May prodded. &#147;Did you?&#148;

&#147;...Just take her out of here.&#148; Sol barked. With those last few words, 
Sol made his way down the steps of the stairway to heaven. The place 
was trashed enough as it was. 

May just forgot about Sol. At the moment, the only thing that mattered 
was Dizzy. May smiled brightly and ran her hand through Dizzy&#146;s lush 
blue hair. She was okay. And they were together again. 

&#147;My Dizzy...&#148; May stated dreamingly. 

**********

Two days later, May, Dizzy, Johnny, June and April and a few of the 
other girls decided to spend a little more time in Fuzhou. The fires 
had been taken care of and all reports of Justice sightings had been 
dismissed by the Union of Nations as a hoax. 

Johnny, April, June and Dizzy were sitting on a wide couch in the main 
room of the Inn they had rested out. It had been fixed up pretty well 
considering Justice tore into the place, and they had even fixed the 
Karaoke machine. Which was what they were about to watch right now. 

Johnny looked at Dizzy who was sitting at his left. She had a slightly 
troubled expression on her face. Like she was worried about something.

&#147;You okay, Dizzy?&#148; Johnny asked. 

Dizzy looked at Johnny. &#147;I am fine...I just...I am worried about 
Testament...I have not seen him in a while...I hope he is okay.&#148;

The captain of the May ship attuned his shades slightly. Testament had 
broken free of Justice&#146;s control after his death, but he wouldn&#146;t 
stay. He only made sure that Dizzy was all right and then left. It was 
probably for the best. 

&#147;I&#146;m sure he&#146;s fine.&#148; Johnny reassured Dizzy. &#147;You know he can visit 
any time he wants to. I&#146;m sure you&#146;ll see him again.&#148;

Dizzy smiled. &#147;Yes...thank you, Mr Johnny.&#148;

Johnny scowled playfully. &#147;Hey, hey, hey! Now what did I tell you 
about all that &#145;Mr Johnny&#146; stuff?&#148;

The young Gear chuckled gently. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, Johnny.&#148; 

&#147;That&#146;s better! Now...I wonder who is going to sing next?&#148;

Backstage, May was busy handling the lyrics for a special song. A song 
that she was going to sing for a special someone. Dressed in her 
favorite midnight black dress, and her hair loose and free, May felt 
more than ready to do this. As soon as the Inn&#146;s owner announced her, 
May stepped through the curtains to the small stage, to see the 
clapping of the crowds and the bewildered looks on Dizzy and the 
others. 

With a microphone in one hand and hope in the other, May smiled at her 
audience but fixed her attentions on Dizzy.

&#147;Hello everyone!&#148; May said, her voice louder due to the microphone. 
&#147;I&#146;m gonna sing a song, for someone really special to me. I hope 
everyone likes it...&#148;

May got her feet tapping, as the speaker started to play her music. 
She really wasn&#146;t a 20th music fan but maybe it could convey the 
point. Something she didn&#146;t feel she could properly express any other 
way. 

&#147;Baby, maybe, we can spend a little time together now that we&#39;re 
alone...&#148; 

May moved around a little. &#147;So long...I have been waiting...now can&#39;t 
you let me take you home?&#148;

&#147;All these things we do will make our dreams come true...&#148;

&#147;You want me, and I surely want you...&#148;

&#147;Tell me where to go...tell me what I need to know...to take you on a 
little ride...&#148;

A blush appeared on May&#146;s face when she started to get whistles from 
some of the younger men in the room, but kept her focus on the one 
person that really mattered. 

May took a deep breath as she continued. &#147;Hold me...control me...let 
me circumnavigate your body, mind and soul...&#148;

&#147;Like a seed from a flower...I can grow and you must know...&#148;

&#147;Sadness, don&#39;t mean a thing...&#145;cause, you and me girl...&#148;

May suddenly got more passionate. &#147;You know we&#39;re in the swing!&#148;

&#147;All the things that I want to get with you on a midsummer night...in 
the evening light...sweet evening light...&#148;

&#147;All these things we do will make our dreams come true...&#148;

&#147;I want you, you want me... I surely need you, baby...&#148;

May turned to look at Dizzy. There was a pleading look in her eyes. A 
look of longing. Dizzy did not mistake it, and her face flushed with 
love when she realized just what May meant by singing such a song. 

&#147;And so far what we&#146;ve done...has made our live become...something 
more than...evening light to make it right!&#148;

&#147;All, all I want from you baby, is sweet loving and I know...I know 
yes I know...I know what I want from you, girl!&#148; 

&#147;We can make it right. We can hold onto each other tight, lose our 
inhibitions...Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!&#148;

As the music took a lower turn, May stopped dancing enough to 
expressed the true meaning of her song. 

&#147;Every little thing we do is good, every little thing you see is 
sweet, every little part of you I&#39;d like to meet...&#148;

&#147;I want you girl, you know I want you...I want you in the evening 
light...&#148;  

The funky backbeat tune died down, and May clammed up when she 
received a standing ovation, people cheering with all their hearts. 
May then looked back at the front row. Johnny, April and June were all 
cheering and praising her and so was Dizzy. May felt her heart 
pounding as Dizzy watched her. Somehow, she got the feeling that Dizzy 
understood her sentiment. Because it was returned with equal passion 
and affection. 

May beamed at her girlfriend. {I love you, Dizzy.}

**********

&#147;Hey, Axl! You done yet?&#148; 

Axl, clad in a pasty white apron, washed the dirty, soiled dishes of 
Jam&#146;s customers, trapped inside that confining kitchen. Axl could not 
stand it. He had bust his back to help out Dizzy, May, Johnny, Jam, 
Sol, Baiken and Anji, yet at the end of the day, he was washing 
dishes. 

{So I couldn&#146;t afford to pay for Jam&#146;s meal, big deal!} Axl thought 
annoyed. {She charges through the roof!} 

Jam poked her head through the doors to the kitchen. &#147;Well? Are you 
done with those dishes yet?&#148;

Axl sighed. &#147;No ma&#146;am...&#148;

&#147;Well then get back to work!&#148; Jam yelled. &#147;I&#146;ll take care of things 
out here...&#148;

Jam pulled her head back and walked through the main dining area over 
to Ky&#146;s table. He had cracked two ribs while battling Justice, and he 
had no other place to go, so Jam happily offered Ky somewhere to stay 
until he got back to full health. 

&#147;Hiya, Ky!&#148; Jam said cheerily, putting down his order on the table. &#147;I 
have your tsukimi soba right here!&#148;

Ky graciously accepted that. &#147;Thank you, Jam. How much do I owe you 
then?&#148;

Jam shook her head. &#147;Free of charge! After all, you really need to 
build your strength up. And what kind of girlfriend would I be if I 
didn&#146;t take care of you?&#148;

Ky looked puzzled. &#147;But...I thought we were just-&#147;

The French knight&#146;s question was cut short when Jam fed him some of 
the tsukimi soba. Axl poked his head through the kitchen doors and 
regretfully saw that. 

{...If Megumi was doing that for me...what a lucky stiff. Sometimes it 
just doesn&#146;t pay to be a background hero...} 

**********

Millia, Baiken and Anji looked out over the cool windy grasslands of 
Fuzhou. Justice had been defeated, and the town had been saved from 
destruction. The only question left was what comes next. Both Baiken 
and Anji had their futures set. They both wanted to confront That Man; 
the only difference was their objectives. But Millia didn&#146;t have that 
same aim. Her mission was fulfilled with the death of Zato. 

Anji sighed as the wind slowly blew his locks of hair. &#147;So...where is 
it that we go from here? I was on my way to Mainland China on a hunch 
about That Man&#146;s location...&#148;

&#147;Then that&#146;s where we&#146;ll go.&#148; Baiken said firmly. She then looked back 
at her assassin companion. &#147;Millia?&#148;

The blonde chuckled. &#147;You saved my life. I have a debt that I owe you. 
And until I pay it back, I think our paths are intertwined.&#148;

Baiken grinned, her ponytail of peachy pink hair flocking in the 
breeze. &#147;Excellent. Then let&#146;s go.&#148;

The trio then began their slow journey towards Mainland China. But as 
the three warriors walked away, two figures watched them from above on 
a small cliff. One of them had an antiquated pipe placed at the corner 
of his mouth, a seemingly living cape over his shoulder, and a monocle 
over his eye. This wise man had his arm swathed around the shoulder of 
a younger looking woman, outwardly innocent, but overflowing with 
underlying power. 

The older man looked over at Millia, Baiken and Anji. &#147;The passage of 
time never ceases to create interesting things. There was always a 
characteristic of peculiarity within the human world. Or maybe I think 
in such a way because I have spent so much time in the darkness. What 
do you say, Sharon?&#148;

Sharon smiled. &#147;I agree, my love.&#148;

A resolute look was masked on Slayer&#146;s face as he looked down upon the 
trio. Or more specifically, Millia. 

&#147;Let it be so...&#148; The Ishu said calmly. &#147;As the wheel of life is 
maintained...a new chapter begins.&#148;

Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts
----------------------

* (Sniff) That&#146;s it folks...the end of the DB, BS saga...I dunno 
whether to laugh or cry...we&#146;ve had some fun though, haven&#146;t we? Yeah 
it&#146;s been a long road, but we&#146;ve finally made to the end. But don&#146;t 
worry! A sequel will be coming soon, that will tie up some of the 
loose ends of the Darkest Body, Brightest Soul storyline (Ky vs. Sol, 
Venom&#146;s fate, Slayer, May/Dizzy as a couple, etc).

Your support/comments/advice/criticism made this fic possible. I also 
want to thank my family and friends, whom I shamefully ignored while 
writing chapters of DB, BS and all the people who read my story. Many 
thanks, you guys.      

* The songs Sexy Boy, Everyday and Pure Again are property of their 
individual creators. I own none of them. But the little Japanese poem 
at the start of this chapter is mine; it&#146;s called Dead Earth Crescent 
Life. If you wish to use it, go right ahead. 

* Sorry to all the people waiting for e-mails from me, I&#146;ve been 
really busy and I haven&#146;t checked my inbox for damn near a week. I&#146;ll 
get back to all of you as soon as I can.

* And...an added sorry for taking so long to update Loop the Loop and 
Rival Rage. But I have written two new chapters to Rival Rage by this 
time, and I&#146;ll get cracking on a new chapter to Loop the Loop as soon 
as possible. 

* Somebody IM me so we can talk about Guilty Gear! I&#146;m always in a 
mood to discuss storyline these days. </pre>
