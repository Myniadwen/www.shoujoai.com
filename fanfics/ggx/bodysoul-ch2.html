<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 2 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Millia collapsed to the ground, taking in viciously low gulps of air 
as she stared up at the victor. The fight had started quickly, almost 
meaninglessly, but it had stared and it ended in Millia&#146;s unlikely 
defeat. 

The frustration on the scarred samurai was more than obvious. She 
stared down at the floored Millia, her sword still drawn. The outcome 
had annoyed Baiken (To say the least). Millia was holding back the 
majority of her strength. And Baiken wasn&#146;t the type to let her 
feelings go unknown.

&#147;Why are you holding back?&#148; Baiken yelled.

If Millia heard that, she certainly wasn&#146;t showing it. She only sat 
there, with a look of indifference painted on her face. 

Millia spoke in a low-key voice. &#147;Destroy me.&#148;

Frustration transformed into anger. &#147;Answer me!&#148;

&#147;I said destroy me.&#148;

Baiken scowled hatefully at her. &#147;You&#146;re a coward. I wont dishonor my 
blade by slaying you. If you&#146;re that afraid to face him, why search?&#148;

For once, something grabbed a slice of Millia&#146;s attention. Yet it 
always came down to him...

Millia looked up at Baiken. &#147;What do you know of me?&#148;

Baiken closed her eye and sheathed her sword. &#147;I saw you at the 
tournament. You defeated the man of shadows. Then they overtook him. 
Possessed by his own weapon...&#148;

Millia scowled lightly as Baiken said that. Zato ruined her life 
didn&#146;t he? Why was she feeling this way?

&#147;I said finish me off...now...&#148; Millia said, a little more frustration 
in it then intended.

The victor looked curiously at the defeated. &#147;Why should I?&#148;

&#147;I said kill me!&#148; Millia screamed, stunning Baiken for a second. 

Baiken let out an ironic grin. &#147;Emotion? In an icy soul such as 
yours?&#148;

If any part of Millia was angry, that part showed itself as her eyes 
flared, directly from fury and she stood up, with her hair contorted 
enough to assume that she was going to throw a Lust Shaker at Baiken. 
The grin on Baiken&#146;s face widened, as if to welcome the challenge, but 
as soon as it appeared, Millia&#146;s anger deflated. 

&#147;Who are you?&#148; Millia breathed.

Needless to say, Baiken was pissed off that Millia didn&#146;t awaken her 
powers, but she assumed it would all come in due time. Baiken sighed 
and walked closer to Millia.

&#147;My name is Baiken Seishino.&#148;

*********

Back at the grotto, Dizzy left contentedly with May and Johnny, 
heading back to the May ship. In spite of his trust, Testament still 
carried some misgivings about Johnny&#146;s intentions with Dizzy. However 
Johnny assured him that he wanted nothing more than to help and 
protect the young Gear. After a moment of indecision, Testament 
accepted this and allowed Dizzy to go with Johnny and May without any 
problems. 

So as soon as all the loose ends were tied up, the three returned to 
the May ship. Later on, when they got back to the ship, Johnny 
introduced Dizzy to the whole crew, showed her around the ship and 
gave her a mildly cut sailor uniform to wear. 

Johnny led Dizzy to her living quarters inside the ship. A nice room 
for a bandit airship. Although Dizzy had agreed that she wanted to 
come along with him and May, Johnny could sense that Dizzy was a 
little bit nervous. But it was understandable. The girl had had such a 
ruff life at the hands of humanity and now she was about to embark on 
a journey with humans themselves.

Dizzy sat down on the plush bed in her room, whilst Johnny leaned back 
on the right wall, bracing his body with his left leg. 

&#147;So Dizzy,&#148; Johnny started. &#147;What do you think of my ship?&#148;

&#147;It is nice. Very different from were I used to live.&#148; Dizzy said 
quietly.

&#147;I&#146;m glad you like it. Cause&#146; it&#146;s your new home. You don&#146;t have to 
worry about any bounty hunters attacking you here.&#148; Johnny said. 

Dizzy sighed sadly. &#147;I am glad.&#148;

That action got Johnny thinking. &#147;Were you troubled a lot? Back at the 
grotto?&#148;

Dizzy nodded. &#147;Yes. Recently someone called Sol Badguy attacked me, 
but he spared my life. I don&#146;t really know why.&#148; 

Johnny winked at Dizzy. &#147;Maybe cause&#146; you&#146;re just too nice, huh?&#148;

The young Gear smiled briefly and thought to herself. This all seemed 
so strange. Humans had considered her a threat since she was an infant 
(Well she&#146;s only 3 now, but still...) and now Dizzy had met these 
caring, gentle humans that completely contradict her original views of 
them. It didn&#146;t seem possible for Dizzy, but at the same time, she 
felt as though it was understandable. There were still so many things 
Dizzy had yet to learn about the world.

Dizzy shifted her legs and fiddled with her hands a bit. &#147;Mr Johnny, 
why did you take me with you?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Humans have been terrorizing me for so long now. But then I meet you 
and the others, and you seem so...kind. Kind to me, but why?&#148;

Johnny&#146;s blas&eacute; disposition morphed into one of a serious yet warm 
contemplation. The chivalrous pirate stopped leaning on the wall and 
sat down next to Dizzy on the bed, beaming a distant gaze in his eyes.

&#147;I guess it started with my father.&#148; Johnny said. 

Dizzy looked at Johnny, no longer fiddling. &#147;Your father?&#148;

Johnny nodded. &#147;Yep. You see my old man was killed by a Gear.&#148;

The minute Johnny said that, Dizzy&#146;s eyes fell in sadness, and Johnny 
picked up on it fairly quickly. 

&#147;Don&#146;t worry, I&#146;m not blaming you.&#148; Dizzy didn&#146;t look at Johnny, but 
nodded in understanding.

&#147;Anyway, when he died, I was left all alone, orphaned. When I grew up, 
I came to understand how hard it could be for orphans, and I wanted to 
do something about it. I wanted to be like my old man, a caring and 
trusting soul. And I swore that I&#146;d help out anyone who felt as though 
they needed help. So I eventually formed the Jellyfish pirates. We&#146;re 
all orphans, dedicated to helping out others. And if it means we have 
to steal a few things to survive...well...&#148;

Dizzy looked at Johnny again. &#147;Thank you Mr Johnny.&#148;

&#147;For taking you along? No need. I gotta help out anyone who needs it.&#148;

Johnny stood up off Dizzy&#146;s bed and made his way to the door. &#147;Well 
I&#146;ll see you later. I gotta take care of a few things before we move 
out. You okay here all alone?&#148;

Dizzy nodded sweetly. &#147;I will be fine Mr Johnny.&#148;

After a quick smile and a nod of his hat, Johnny exited Dizzy&#146;s room 
and made his way to the bridge. While walking in the corridor, May ran 
up to Johnny from behind. The surprised Johnny looked down to see the 
young girl smiling at her.

Johnny unconsciously smiled back. &#147;Oh, hey May. What&#146;s up?&#148;

May giggled. &#147;I was worried about you, Johnny. You&#146;ve been gone for a 
while and I couldn&#146;t find you.&#148;

&#147;I was showing Dizzy around the ship. Nice girl.&#148;  Johnny said.

&#147;Yeah she is. A bit quiet though. Is she in her room?&#148; May asked.

Johnny nodded and nudged his hat up. &#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;I think I&#146;ll go see her.&#148; May quickly walked back in the direction 
she came from, towards Dizzy&#146;s room. Johnny chuckled to himself for a 
second, and walked back to the bridge.

**********

A knock came at the door to Dizzy&#146;s room. The fledgling pirate leaned 
up from the bed she was lying on, and called out to the knocker.

&#147;Please come in.&#148;

The oval shaped metal door opened slowly to reveal May at the front of 
the doorway. Dizzy let a small smile surface over her lips, and looked 
to the ground bashfully.

May smiled brightly at Dizzy, not noticing the change in the young 
Gear girl&#146;s behaviour. &#147;Hi, Dizzy!&#148;

Dizzy didn&#146;t look up. &#147;Hi...&#148;

May closed the door behind her and took a seat next to Dizzy on the 
bed, temporarily forcing Dizzy to look up again. 

May lifted her legs up off the ground and smiled again. &#147;So how do you 
like the May ship? Pretty cool, huh?&#148; 

&#147;Yes, I like it. Your ship is very big.&#148; Dizzy said.

May&#146;s voice lowered in its joy. &#147;Johnny showed you around, did he?&#148;

&#147;Yes. Mr Johnny is very nice.&#148; 

The auburn haired pirate lowered her legs to the ground, and looked at 
Dizzy with a serious expression on her face. Dizzy saw that and felt a 
bit uneasy. 

&#147;Me and Johnny are meant for each other you know, so I&#39;d really 
appreciate it if you&#39;d just back off, okay?&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s eyes widened at *that*. The young gear shook her head 
profusely and blushed a plentiful crimson.

&#147;No...n-no...I&#146;m not, I mean I don&#146;t...Mr Johnny is just a...I really 
am not...&#148; The gear could barely get out her sentences without 
stammering, and May started to take note of the few things she could 
make out from Dizzy.

May&#146;s smile returned to her face. &#147;You&#146;re not interested in Johnny?&#148;

Dizzy shook her head again. &#147;No.&#148;

May whipped her arms around Dizzy and giggled childishly, drawing 
Dizzy into a playful and friendly hug of appreciation.

&#147;That&#146;s great! Now we can be close friends!&#148; May said.

Dizzy blushed again and smiled a bit. She was happy that she hadn&#146;t 
upset May. For some reason, Dizzy didn&#146;t want to do anything to upset 
the pirate girl. 

&#147;You...like Mr Johnny that way?&#148; Asked Dizzy. May sighed a longing 
sigh and stared off dreamily.

&#147;Yep. Johnny is such a hunk! Don&#146;t you think so?&#148;

Dizzy looked away. &#147;I...wouldn&#146;t really know...&#148;

May&#146;s dark eyes became confused. &#147;Why&#146;s that?&#148;

Dizzy stood up, and ran a hand through her dark blue hair nervously, 
her wings dropping a few light and dark feathers. May continued to 
look curiously at Dizzy.

&#147;Um...I...don&#146;t think...that I really...&#148; Dizzy trailed off.

But May&#146;s curiosity wasn&#146;t satisfied with that, and nudged for an 
answer. &#147;Yeah...?&#148; 

Dizzy&#146;s blush deepened. &#147;N-nothing...&#148;

**********

A few hours later, Baiken and Millia had left the grassland trail that 
they were previously fighting at, and made their way to a nearby bar. 
It was in the ruins of a city partially destroyed by Justice in the 
Crusades. Although around 60% had been wasted, a few dedicated souls 
remained in the city, surviving from aid and financial help from the 
Union of Nations.

Baiken had been watching over the place for quite sometime now. There 
was no threat from a Gear, but Baiken always kept her watchful eye 
open for anything. 

It was only today that Baiken had decided to move out and continue her 
search for &#145;The Man,&#146; in the hopes of executing her revenge. Then of 
course, she ran into Millia.

The two went the bar that Baiken had described, in the lower levels of 
the ruins of the city. When the two walked in, gasps of panic were 
surrounding the two of them. Millia had no clue as to why they were 
treating she and Baiken in this fashion, but Baiken realized that 
these folks were still intimidated by the raw ass kicking she served 
up to Chipp Zanuff the other night. Baiken didn&#146;t mind it. A little 
fear keeps you in line. 

Millia and Baiken sat down at a table off in a silent far corner, 
albeit a few stares and murmurs. 

Millia looked at the samurai with a genuine gaze of enquiring need. 
She had absolutely no reason to be here, in fact staying in one place 
for too long might be a bad thing, but Millia didn&#146;t feel the need to 
leave. The blonde wanted to know more about Baiken. Simply because the 
war-withered woman made so many accurate estimations in regards to her 
when in reality she knew very little about Millia. 

Millia didn&#146;t like the idea of being so easy to read. But at the same 
time, she felt as though this was something that was unique to Baiken, 
and a mild curiosity was enough to make Millia want to know more about 
her.

&#147;...Baiken,&#148; Millia began. &#147;What is it that motivates you to fight?&#148;

Baiken&#146;s concentration was fixed on the people staring the two of 
them, but it was directed back to Millia when she spoke.

Her peach eyes darkened to think of her past. &#147;What makes you ask?&#148;

&#147;You strike me as a person who has a history behind her missing arm. 
You can stop me if I&#146;m wrong.&#148;

Baiken stared at the claw and chain attached to her body in the place 
of her left arm, and frowned darkly.

&#147;Oh this? This is just a scar of the past. A helpful reminder of my 
true desire. When I was younger, I lived in an institution in Japan.&#148;

Millia looked openly confused. &#147;That&#146;s means you&#146;re-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s more complicated than that. My institution was devastated by the 
Gears, all of my friends and family killed. Throughout the mass 
destruction, I lost my left arm and my right eye. It was only by good 
fortune that I managed to survive. I don&#146;t remember much else about 
that day, except for the heat of the flames, the plangent smell of 
roasted flesh, the smoke and the screams of terror. However one image 
still remains fresh in my mind.&#148;

Baiken closed her eye. &#147;The image of a man...surrounded by them...&#148;

{Them?} Millia thought.

Baiken&#146;s eye opened. &#147;I know that man is my adversary. All this body 
really lives for is to seek vengeance for my fallen kin.&#148;

While Baiken was talking, a waiter brought them a bottle of Sake and 
two western glasses. Baiken poured out the sake for Millia and herself 
respectively and gulped it down.

Millia sipped some sake also. She wasn&#146;t much of a drinker but it felt 
appropriate at the time. &#147;I see. So you want revenge.&#148; 

&#147;Maybe we are not as different as you first assumed, eh?&#148; Baiken said.  

Millia&#146;s eyes narrowed, and she looked at Baiken with that same old 
icy expression. &#147;How do you keep doing that?&#148;

&#147;Doing what?&#148;

Millia sighed. &#147;Accurately predicting me and my past.&#148;

Baiken let out a haughty chortle. &#147;So I&#146;m right?&#148;

&#147;Maybe.&#148;

Baiken stopped laughing enough to pour some more Sake and swig a fresh 
sample of it. Staring at Millia, the cerise haired samurai became 
curious to know about Millia&#146;s past.

&#147;So...what might your &#145;motivation to fight&#146; be?&#148; Baiken said. 

Millia&#146;s eyes grew even more distant. &#147;Why would you want to know?&#148;

Baiken grinned ironically. &#147;An eye for and eye. I told you my story, 
now I want to know yours. It&#146;s the warrior&#146;s code.&#148;

&#147;I never desired to be a killer.&#148;

&#147;Yet you have the power of one. Being a warrior and a murderer are two 
different things. I didn&#146;t take you for a person who would be confused 
by that.&#148; Baiken stated. 

Millia just sighed and rolled her eyes, sipping more Sake. She had 
begun to get a taste for it.

&#147;I did not want to be a warrior either. I don&#146;t think that there is 
much of a difference. They both slaughter people, do they not?&#148;

Baiken looked hard at Millia. &#147;Stop avoiding my question.&#148;

&#147;From what I was told, I came from a small hamlet in Russia. I don&#146;t 
know what either of my parents look like, they were killed in the 
crusades and I was too young to get a suitable mental picture of them. 
I was apparently found as an infant in the ruins of my village, by an 
assassin organization. I was taken to the Guild of Assassins in 
Russia, and was raised there by the leaders of the group. They taught 
me how to control and manipulate the dexterity and flexibility of my 
hair, and use it as a weapon. But I...did not want to be an assassin. 
I did not want to kill as a way of life. I tried to take my own life a 
few times, but never succeeded. I guess the guild thought losing me 
would be a waste of their primary assets. Then, the biggest mission of 
all came up. Led by the famous...Zato-ONE. The man who&#146;s following in 
the organization is almost as big as that of its founder, Slayer. So, 
I was given a key role in the assignment, and was positioned 
separately from Zato and the others. But instead of following the 
orders I was given, I took the time to flee. I didn&#146;t find out until 
later that my actions had I direct effect on the mission. The 
assassins were caught in the act and Zato was imprisoned. Since then, 
the guild has been after me. Whether to kill me or bring me back I 
don&#146;t know, but thanks to them I now live my life as a recluse. I 
decided that I would never be happy until I stopped Zato and the 
assassins from terrorizing me. So I resolved to enter the 
International fighting tournament when I heard that Zato had escaped 
from jail and he would be competing in it. I did not know anything 
about it being a farce, just there to resurrect Justice. All I really 
cared about was destroying Zato. I felt that I would truly be free if 
brought him to the grave. And that the guild would be put into 
disarray subsequent to Zato&#146;s defeat. I did manage to beat Zato as you 
know. But as she lay there, beaten, his body was overrun by the very 
shadows he thought he had control over. After his defeat, as I 
expected, the assassins have been put into disorder. And even though I 
more or less succeeded in the majority of my goals, for some reason I 
felt...strange about Zato&#146;s fate...he was my master, but...&#148;

Baiken listen intently to Millia&#146;s story. &#147;But you still felt guilty. 
And now the only way you can see to alleviate that guilt is to kill 
your own benefactor?&#148;

Millia nodded, a grim look in her crystal blue eyes. 

&#147;I understand. It must be difficult for you. I can now see why that 
man troubles you so.&#148; Baiken said sympathetically.        

Millia sipped more of her sake. &#147;I have to kill Zato. His soul will 
not stop torturing me unless I do.&#148; 

&#147;Will that cleanse you? Will killing this...Zato-ONE character really 
free you?&#148; Baiken asked.

&#147;I...do not know. But I cannot allow him to live any longer. I cannot 
have these dreams haunting me for eternity. I will not rest until Zato 
is dead...or I am.&#148;

Darkest Body, Brightest Soul part 3: Be it born

It had been two months since had Dizzy joined the Jellyfish pirates 
and become a part of Johnny&#146;s all female crew. At first, Dizzy had 
found it hard to settle into life on the May ship. It was just so much 
different from her previous experiences that it caught her off guard. 
Despite that May had helped to get Dizzy settled in and the two of 
them had become fast friends. 

However Dizzy could not help but feel a deepening closeness between 
she and May. It may not have been mutual, but Dizzy was becoming 
attached to May in a way that could not be considered to be just 
friendship. 

May on the other hand, was clueless. In her eyes, Dizzy was just a 
friend, and the only one that had a place in her heart was Johnny.

But things change...

**********   

Dizzy was back in her room, grooming her wings. It was one of those 
little traits that she had picked inside the grotto, and it had stuck 
with her. Normally she would take this time to reflect on the past, 
but lately, Dizzy had been thinking about nothing more than May.

A mild crimson blush rose unto Dizzy&#146;s cheeks the very second May&#146;s 
name came to mind. Dizzy knew how important May had become to her. 
Although Dizzy liked all of the crew, May was the only one that Dizzy 
felt genuinely comfortable with. No one could put her at ease or 
console her as well as May could. 

Even the fact that May was human seemed irrelevant. None of it 
mattered anymore. All that Dizzy cared about was getting even closer 
to May, and just maybe get her to look a little deeper.

As Dizzy finished grooming her wings, she dusted away the stray 
feathers and pulled out a book from under her bed. No matter what 
happened, Dizzy would always have a yearning for more knowledge.

A knock came at the door, as soon as Dizzy flipped open a few pages. 
Without looking back, Dizzy ushered them in. 

&#147;Come in.&#148; Dizzy said absently. 

The door opened up, and May walked in happily with a tray full of food 
in her hands. &#147;Morning Dizzy!&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s eyes widened in surprise, and a second blush came on her face. 
She didn&#146;t even have to look up to tell that was May. Dizzy put the 
book she was about to read down, and smiled bashfully at May.

&#147;Good morning, May. How are you today?&#148; Dizzy said timidly.

May grinned a toothy grin. &#147;I&#146;m fine, silly! But you didn&#146;t come down 
for breakfast, so I brought breakfast to you!&#148;

May brought the tray in her hands right up to Dizzy&#146;s nose, and Dizzy 
sweat-dropped at May&#146;s forthright nature. So very blunt.
&#147;Um...thank you...&#148;

May winked. &#147;No problem! But as soon as you finish eating, could you 
help me out with something?&#148;

Dizzy set the tray down on her lap, grabbed the fork and began to eat, 
just as May spoke to her. &#147;Certainly May, what do you need help with?&#148;

&#147;I just need some help with a few things and you&#146;re the only one I can 
trust with it.&#148; May said.
