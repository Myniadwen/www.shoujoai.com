<h1>The Last Requiem</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>We&#39;re spinning round on this ball of hate,
There&#39;s no parole, there&#39;s no great escape,
We&#39;re sentenced here until the end of days,
And then my brother there&#39;s a price to pay,

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I-no.

My soul bleeds to see her like this. I....I&#146;ve never...experienced 
this side of her before. To see another side of someone you&#146;ve felt 
that you&#146;ve known is...disturbing. The playful glint in her eyes is 
gone. Her smile was always devious but...this is different. And that 
is not the end of my concern. 

It&#146;s her eyes.

So cold, so sterile. So full of rage. That isn&#146;t the woman I know. Or 
at least not the woman I thought I knew. Maybe my view of her was 
wrong from the start. I never liked her attitude towards me or her 
treatment of me.  

How much of a fool I am, I can&#146;t bare to see this. Yet what really 
shocks me, is my lack of concern for the corpse resting next to her. 
Zato&#146;s corpse. My whole adult life was spent either running from this 
man or hunting him down like the dog he is (was). Yet as he lies next 
to her feet, lifeless. It just isn&#146;t what I had expected. His 
life...is already over. He was dying long before he came into contact 
with I-no, I can see that now. 

Is this really what I&#146;ve been chasing, all along?

But I cannot mistake myself. I knew that Zato was already dead. To me, 
he had died the day he joined forces with his shadow. The man I knew 
is gone. His body and shadow exist no longer...but his soul still 
lives.

It lives within me. 

That is why my mortal body will follow his cadaver to the ends of the 
earth. As long as it continues to be on this world, I will be there to 
crush it. Because it reminds me of the thing Zato became. When he 
became the man I hate. 

But with the effort it took me to find him, she finishes him with that 
much of speed. And I can tell that she feels some satisfaction from it 
all. To know that *she* was the one who ended my struggle. To her the 
saga of Zato is over.  But the whole concept of this situation that 
she possesses it incorrect. Unless I finish him with my own hands, it 
will not be over for me. I thought that she had at least begun to 
understand the way I feel...but I was wrong. Wrong about her again.

Was I wrong about her to begin with?

No...I know there is good within her. I can feel it. 

Before long...she speaks out to me. &#147;Well, well, well...hey there, 
Cookie. I was beginning to think that you wouldn&#146;t show. But I guess 
it&#146;s not kinda like you to be missing out on the party...especially 
when this shithole is involved.&#148;

I see her stamp on Zato&#146;s...no...that body&#146;s face. &#147;I-no...&#148; I hear my 
own voice. I sound fearful. But of what? &#147;I have to finish 
him...please...just...&#148;

&#147;Just what?&#148; She says, her cocky, arrogant smile returning to her. 
&#147;Step aside? So you and your piece of shit carcass can rest in peace? 
You really think I could care less? I&#146;d have more fun ripping his 
limbs off. You concur, don&#146;t you? &#148;

I know when she&#146;s serious about something. She means what she says. 
But how...can she not understand why I need to do this? 

&#147;I-no...please do not get in the way of this. I have to end it all...&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

We&#39;re only human, we were born to die,
Without the benefit of reason why,
We live for pleasure - to be satisfied,
And now it&#39;s over there&#39;s no place to hide. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Geh. Look at her. 

Sweet ass cutie. 

I&#146;d do myself a mischief tryin&#146; to figure out what makes that head 
tick. Not like I could give a damn about her bullshit quest away. What 
really gets to me...is how obsessed she is over this damn shadow box. 
So much effort wasted on a pile of crap like this guy. Makes me wanna 
puke.

All of it. Everything she does, everything she says, everything she 
fights for. It&#146;s all down to him. He&#146;s the reason she doesn&#146;t...want 
to...

Gah! Screw it all, I don&#146;t care. I want a bit of fun for myself...I 
know she&#146;ll amuse me. Always has. Only this time, it won&#146;t involve me 
stripping her of her virginity. I&#146;ll be ripping into her little boy 
toy. Will she try and stop me? Heh...not like she has the balls to. 

A fucking coward like her. 

Always piss running from a situation. Even if it screws around with 
the people she leaves in her wake.  As long as she and &#145;Zato&#146; get the 
chance to wipe the floor with each other, that&#146;s all she&#146;ll ever want. 

Even though I was the one who fucking broke her in. Even though *I* 
was the one who made her in a woman. So I think I&#146;m owed this...now...

&#147;What should I do first, Cookie?&#148;  I say, her eyes already shaking. 
&#147;Should I tear of one of those strong little arms of his and shove it 
up his ass? Or should I cleave out that black heart and hand it over 
to you? It seems to be what you want.&#148;

She&#146;s getting angry. But more at herself than me. Bummer. &#147;You could 
never know what this is like for me, I-no. Please do not stand in my 
way. Step aside.&#148;

What an arrogant bitch. &#147;You really think I could give a fuck about 
what you want right now, do you, Cookie? You assassins are all the 
same. You think the whole pissing world revolves around you. Like time 
will stop unless you get what you want.&#148;

&#147;I am not an assassin.&#148; I see that little glint of anger in her eyes. 
I like it. 

&#147;Is that right...? Well, I guess I never could comprehend you Guild 
members.&#148; Just as she steps a little closer, I hoist her boytoy&#146;s 
corpse up with my hand.  &#147; I know! How about an anatomy lesson? 
What-makes-an-assassin-tick 101. First class is a dissection.  Slice 
up the subject&#146;s stomach and inspect the assassin- borne innards. That 
sounds like one bitch of an idea. Care to join me?&#148;

I see her scowl. &#147;Why are you acting this way?&#148;

And damn to hell, I know I&#146;m shocked. Like she doesn&#146;t already know 
the score. This ain&#146;t my damn problem. I didn&#146;t run from my troubles. 
I didn&#146;t run away from the one thing that could make me happy. I 
wasn&#146;t the one who kicked her out of my life. Who the hell does she 
think is to be acting like the fucking victim here? 

&#147;Answer me, I-no! Why are you-&#147;

&#147;Shut the fuck up!&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Why don&#39;t you...come down too...
It&#39;s such a brutal planet, it&#39;s such an ugly world
Why won&#39;t you, come down too...

This world is such perfection (What a sight)
It&#39;s just like paradise (For my eyes)
A truly grand creation (What a sight)
From up here it looks so nice (For my eyes)
 
It&#39;s such a brutal planet, it&#39;s such a living hell,
It was a holy garden, that&#39;s right where Adam fell. 
It&#39;s where the bite was taken, it&#39;s where we chose to sin, 
It&#39;s where we first were naked; this is where our death begins.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Why is she acting like this?

Is it because I left her the way I did? That is it...isn&#146;t it? This is 
all because&#133;she thinks I chose Zato over her. How can she so blindly 
misinterpret the situation?  Why can&#146;t she see this from my point of 
view? It&#146;s...important to me that I deliver Zato by my own hands. If I 
don&#146;t&#133;I&#146;ll never be set free from the cage the Assassins have made for 
me...I need my life back...

And regardless of that...why is she still clinging to that? That thing 
we had? It wasn&#146;t love...it wasn&#146;t even friendship. Just mindless, 
comforting sex&#133;I will not go on like this...I cannot allow myself to 
use another human being like a tool for my relief.

Please let her understand. &#147;I-no&#133;It wasn&#146;t right...you know it 
wasn&#146;t...that&#146;s not the way it should be...&#148;

She knows exactly what I&#146;m speaking about. And as I finish my 
statement to her, a see that hateful glare in her eye. It&#146;s as though 
she...despises me...as though she hates me. 

She hates me?

I-no...

&#147;You really think I could give a shit about you, don&#146;t you?&#148; She says, 
scorn leaking from every word spoken. &#147;Get over yourself, Cookie. This 
isn&#146;t about you. It&#146;s about me. I&#146;ll cut you out of my head just like 
I&#146;m gonna do to your boy toy.&#148;

She...doesn&#146;t care...I...I cannot face this. Zato is the issue. 
This...isn&#146;t the time. Why won&#146;t she step aside? Why do we have to go 
through this?  I feel my hair buzzing with intent. Quickly it sharpens 
out, almost of its own will. It seems to sense and understand my base 
instincts better than I can. 

And I see I-no grin with delight. She actually wants to do battle with 
me. Why is this happening? We don&#146;t need to do this...we do not need 
to...

I struggle to hold back the fury of my hair. &#147;I-no...please do not 
make me do this...&#148;

It&#146;s too late. I-no is already charging me. And sure enough my 
fighting instinct is doing the thinking for me as I prepare to defend 
myself

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

We took advice from that deceiving snake,
He said don&#39;t worry it&#39;s a piece of cake.
And sent us swimming in a burning lake,
Now we&#39;re abandoned here for heaven&#39;s sake.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I rush towards her; with Marlene at my side ready to pay back 
everything she&#146;s done to me.  I swear I won&#146;t hold back. The second I 
get close to her, she quickly dashes to one side to avoid me, using 
her hair to formulate a shield as protection. 

Always running away. That&#146;s Millia Rage all over. 

She thinks she&#146;s so special, so divine, and so pure. And because I&#146;m 
the way I am, I don&#146;t get a slice of that purity. I could hate her for 
it, and I do...but it something all people think they have. Measly 
bastards. Yet still, people question Justice&#146;s reasoning for blowing 
this shit ass race to pieces. Too bad he had to be so preachy and 
political about it. But hell knows if I could give a damn about that 
thing. 

All that matters to me right now is making her feel just the way she 
should feel. 

And I&#146;ll smash her into the dirt when I&#146;m done. As soon as she stops 
moving, sliding along the grass of this miserably pathetic 
countryside, I narrow my eyes down on her. And my sleek fingers pluck 
at the strings of Marlene. 

Instantly, waves of ultra-sonic, stone-tearing energy cut through the 
barriers of the crisp air, right for Millia. The blast slices through 
her shield of hair, and rams into her lower abdomen, knocking the 
breath right out of her. I&#146;ll be damned if I let her get away with 
what she&#146;s done. 

She left me...for that fucking shadow of hers. 

She gives her heart to him, but she shows nothing but contempt to me. 
She&#146;s the souring angel, while I&#146;m the dirty stain on the floor. But I 
have the power now. This is my damn time. 

I&#146;m on top now.

What do you have, Millia? What the fuck do you have!? I have power, I 
have strength. I have Marlene by my side. What the hell do you know?! 
What the hell do you have?! Why the hell do you have the right to turn 
me away?!

You can&#146;t ignore me now! You won&#146;t get away with pissing me around 
after I gave you my fucking body! 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

This world is such perfection (What a sight)
It&#39;s just like paradise (For my eyes)
A truly grand creation (What a sight)
From up here it looks so nice (For my eyes)

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Uggh...

I...my body...can&#146;t take much more of this...

I yell fiercely as each of I-no&#146;s attacks collide with my body. I feel 
me knees giving out on me in addition. I...cannot cope with it all... 

The final blast from I-no knocks me straight from my feet, and my body 
is tossed across the grass from its absolute force. I cough up small 
traces of blood from my throat. She&#146;s...willingly hurting me. But I 
can&#146;t bring myself...to fight back. 

I don&#146;t want to hurt her...and I know deep down that she doesn&#146;t want 
to hurt me. But she blinds herself with that anger...am...I like that? 
She once told me that my zealous nature would follow Zato into the 
grave. Was she right? Am I...this serious about it?  

Why is it that the more I see of this woman...the more I see of 
myself? 

I can&#146;t ponder it anymore...I feel myself...slipping. And I see her 
intimidating presence towering over me. But just before I 
lose...consciousness, I realize what is about to happen. 

I-no is going to kill me. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Here&#39;s where we keep the armies, here&#39;s where we write those names,
Here&#39;s where the money god is, here&#39;s our famous hall of shame.
Here&#39;s where we starve the hungry, here&#39;s where we cheat the poor,
Here&#39;s where we beat the children, here is where we pay the whore.

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

She can&#146;t fucking run from me now. I made sure of that. I have Marlene 
at the ready, and my hand is poised to strike at her strings. But yet 
I freeze. Just like before, I freeze up when the prospect of killing 
Millia.

Why can&#146;t I finish her?

Why am I so besotted with her? I&#146;ve just demolished an entire village 
on nothing more than a whim. I slaughtered those blind cattle like the 
cheap stock they were. Yet when I see her...I can&#146;t&#133;end her.
Why?

It...can&#146;t be love...I can&#146;t love that cowardly bitch...no...

Why the hell can&#146;t I kill her?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Why don&#39;t you...come down too...
It&#39;s such a brutal planet, it&#39;s such an ugly world
Why won&#39;t you...come down too...

This world is such perfection (What a sight)
It&#39;s just like paradise (For my eyes)
A truly grand creation (What a sight)
From up here it looks so nice (For my eyes)

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I slowly draw up from my sleep. It is dark. And I am in one piece. I 
look for her, but I do not find her. All I see is Zato&#146;s body, left 
there for me to what I want with. By I-no.

She didn&#146;t end my life, but now she&#146;s gone.

Do I care for her? Or am I...

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Right here we stoned the prophets, built idols out of mud,
Right here we fed the lions, Christian flesh and Christian blood.
Down here is where we hung ya, upon an ugly cross;
Over there we filled the ovens, right here the holocaust. 

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

I-no sighed angrily as she waited quietly in the rain for her quarry. 
Millia was not her concern anymore. Millia didn&#146;t love her at all. So 
there was no sense in wasting her time on the blonde assassin. It 
would just be better to do what she did best.

Kill. 

A deathly grin tugged at I-no&#146;s lips as she heard a voice all out to 
her. 

The gruff voice was deep. &#147;Bring that bastard out here.&#148;

&#147;Well, well, well...&#148; I-no began. &#147;Corrupted Flame. You don&#146;t call, 
you don&#146;t write, I was beginning to think I&#146;d never see you again, 
asshole.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

THE END


Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts 
----------------------
* Geh. Was it me or was that ending total crap? Geez, I did have a 
much better ending for the Kage no Ren&#146;ai series, but...I didn&#146;t like 
the road it was going down. A little *too* dark if you ask me. I could 
write up the different ending but...eh...Oh well. I&#146;m starting my 
Millia/I-no love afresh, with a whole new multi-chapter story. 
Although, I can&#146;t say how long you&#146;ll have to wait for it.
