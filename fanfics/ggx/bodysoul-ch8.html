<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 8 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&#147;Alright gang, you&#146;ve had your fun! Now its time to work! I got the 
details for the next heist!&#148; Johnny yelled eagerly.

May, Dizzy, April and the rest of the crew were at the main cabin of 
the May ship, and were listening to Johnny&#146;s briefing. They had all 
been called up about ten minutes ago, to get the info on the May 
ship&#146;s next big plunder, and the current objectives for that mission. 

While Dizzy and April (who were sitting in the front row of seats 
facing Johnny) listened intently to the dashing captain of the May 
ship, May let Johnny&#146;s words go through one ear and out the other. Her 
true attention was focused on Dizzy. It was just yesterday that the 
two had gone to the artificial hot spring outside of Neo-Madrid, and 
they did have a whole load of fun. Though May enjoyed it, her concern 
was not to have fun, but to cheer Dizzy up. And from the look on 
Dizzy&#146;s face when they left, May had done just that. 

May sighed dreamily while staring at Dizzy from the corner of her eye. 
{I&#146;m glad she&#146;s feeling better.}

At the point at which May was thinking to herself, April tapped her on 
her shoulder. The brunette shook her head in surprise and stared at 
April with an awfully incredulous look on her face.

&#147;What?&#148; May said irritably. 

A small snigger escaped from April&#146;s lips, but she tried to suppress 
it. May was completely oblivious to herself. 

April pointed to Johnny while he was speaking. &#147;Are you paying any 
attention?&#148;  

The way that May scratched her head proved that she didn&#146;t. &#147;To what?&#148;

&#147;You and Dizzy are gonna make the main pull.&#148; April said.

May&#146;s eyes widened. &#147;You gotta be kidding me...&#148;

She and Dizzy in a heist? Fair enough, Dizzy had been on the ship for 
quite a few months now, so eventually she would have to do this, but 
May didn&#146;t like the idea of involving Dizzy in a robbery, regardless 
of the reason.  

May stuck her hand in the air and looked at Johnny, who was in the 
middle of explaining the merit of said mission, to the rest of the 
crew. A couple seconds later, the pirate girl caught Johnny&#146;s 
attention.

&#147;What&#146;s up, May?&#148;

May put her hand down. &#147;Captain, I don&#146;t think we should involve Dizzy 
in a heist.&#148;

Both Johnny and Dizzy gave May strange looks, but Dizzy was the first 
to act upon it. 

&#147;What do you mean? Do you not think I can handle it?&#148; Dizzy asked 
inquisitively. 

May shook her head. &#147;No. It&#146;s not that, I just don&#146;t think it&#146;d be a 
job that you&#146;d like. I don&#146;t think you should be put into something 
like that. Not yet at least.&#148;

Johnny adjusted his shades. &#147;May might be right, Dizzy. This is an 
important mission and we&#146;ll need to show you the ropes before you can 
be of any real use. Gee, I guess I should have thought about that from 
before...&#148;

The chief advisor of the May ship put her hand up. &#147;I could take 
Dizzy&#146;s place, Captain.&#148;

Johnny winked at April from behind his shades. &#147;Sure, April. All 
right, do we all know the plan? April and May will sneak into this 
rich guy&#146;s mansion, go into his cellar, and steal the gold there. And 
just so you don&#146;t get caught, I&#146;ll be at the front gate, diverting the 
guards and focus their efforts on me. When we finish, you guys have 
gotta come pick us up. Got it?&#148;

Everyone accept Dizzy yelled out happily. &#147;Yeah!!&#148;

Johnny April and the others filled out of the main cabin, and returned 
to their daily chores and work, and made slight preparations for the 
mission. On her way out, May looked around for Dizzy but couldn&#146;t find 
her. She then looked back and saw Dizzy, fixed in place on her seat, 
with her head hung low. 

The dolphin swingin&#146; pirate walked back to Dizzy and placed a hand on 
her shoulder.  &#147;What&#146;s wrong? It&#146;s lunch! We can eat now.&#148;

The cerulean haired Gear stood up and faced Dizzy with a blunt 
expression.

&#147;Why did you not let me go with you?&#148; Dizzy said.

May sweat dropped. &#147;Um...did you really wanna go?&#148;

&#147;I would have liked to have been given the option.&#148;

May smiled. It wasn&#146;t anything serious. By taking Dizzy by the hand, 
May brought the Gear down on her seat and May casually sat next to 
her. 

&#147;I didn&#146;t mean to take anything away from you, I just didn&#146;t want you 
to get involved in anything like a robbery. April hasn&#146;t even finished 
teaching you how to fly the May ship.&#148;

Dizzy looked away. &#147;Are you sure that you are not just trying to avoid 
working with me?&#148;

The expression on May&#146;s visage just screamed &#145;stupid idea!&#146; 

&#147;Of course not. I love working with you.&#148; The grip May had on Dizzy&#146;s 
hand tightened. &#147;I mean that.&#148; 

May stopped herself for a second, took a moment of brief, 
contemplative thought, and lit up like a bulb. &#147;Oh! I know! When me 
and April go out today, how about I bring you something?&#148;

Dizzy smiled appreciatively. She wasn&#146;t preferable to stolen gifts but 
if it came from May... &#147;Thank you.&#148;

**********

Six hours later, at around 12.00, midnight, the May ship hovered over 
the flourishing city of Berlin. Unlike the rest of Europe, Germany had 
existed fairly well, mostly because it was very isolated during the 
crusades. Very little people lived in Germany back then, so it 
attracted very few Gears. Because of this policy of isolationism, 
Germany had not suffered very much and after coming out of the 
crusades, it had taken its place as one of the richest countries in 
the world. And because of that, it had some of the strongest guards 
and soldiers in the world too.

But the jolly crew of the May ship was not intimidated by that fact at 
all. They were going to rob a powerful yet corrupt politician of all 
he had. The plan was simple. Johnny, May and April would hop off the 
May ship, and make their way to the politician&#146;s countryside mansion 
outside of Berlin itself. The May ship wouldn&#146;t land, but it wouldn&#146;t 
leave either, it would just circle the sky until Johnny, May and April 
came back with the spoils of their efforts. From the moment the get 
off, Johnny would separate from May and April, infiltrate the mansion, 
draw out all of the guards and security, and then handle them all 
independently. During Johnny&#146;s brave distraction, May and April would 
sneak in, pilfer the gold, and then make tracks. On the way back to 
the ship, May would send Johnny a signal, from then he would make his 
escape, meet up with May and April, the jump back onto the May ship. 

It was a straightforward plan, but May and April had to be quick. At 
12.02, the May ship quickly landed and dropped off Johnny, May and 
April.   

The three stepped onto cold, wet grass and breathed in fresh, calming 
night air. Johnny held his sword to his waist and smiled at May and 
April. &#147;Alrighty then, guys. Let&#146;s get started shall we?&#148;

**********

Johnny nudged his hat up and smiled at May and April quickly, then 
swiftly made a dash for the 1950&#146;s style replica mansion. The 
chivalrous pirate ran and ran until he came to the steel gate around 
the building. However, Johnny didn&#146;t stop running. As he reached the 
gate he focused his power into a mighty leap that gave him enough 
height to make it clear across the 6-foot steel gates. After landing 
gracefully, he picked up his speed again and made a second burst 
across the courtyard. Within a few seconds, he was in range of the 
massive front door of the corrupt politician&#146;s mansion. 

Johnny&#146;s run slowed from a dash to a stroll to a stop, and he 
gluttonously sucked in cool night air to rejuvenate himself. 

The captain of the May ship wiped his brow of a few beads of sweat. 
&#147;Whoa! Haven&#146;t run like that in ages...Who!&#148;

After catching his breath, the blonde pirate steeled himself and 
banged loudly on the large doors before him. 

&#147;Open up sucker, I have business!&#148; Johnny yelled.

Sure enough, two burly male guards, both seven feet in height, stepped 
up to Johnny with disdainful glares. Johnny was not fazed, but a hand 
did unconsciously straddle itself along the hilt of his sleek sword.

Throwing a cheery smile at the two guards who loomed over him, Johnny 
slowly began to pull his sword out of its sheath...millimetre by 
millimetre...

&#147;Well boys,&#148; Johnny started. &#147;It seems business has just picked up...&#148; 

With a misleading and cat-like agility, one of the stout guards lunged 
at Johnny. Casting him nothing but a smile Johnny sidestepped out of 
the way and drew his sword in one swift, elegant movement. Infuriated 
that he missed his target, the guard swivelled on his heels and sprang 
at Johnny once more. This time however, the guard fell to his knees 
just a few inches from Johnny. 

The guard clutched his ribs and felt a sharp pang just below his 
fingers. The second he pulled his hand away, his eyes widened at the 
sight of the slick blood soiling his hand. 

Johnny chuckled haughtily at the downed guard as he cast the pirate a 
bewildered gaze. &#147;You&#146;re too large, buddy. You&#146;re an effortless target 
and with my lightning-fast draw, I&#146;ll cut you easily.&#148; 

The guard doubled over, and the second lashed out at Johnny, annoyed 
by his apparent arrogance. During his charge, the rock-hard man pulled 
a shining Damascus-cut knife, and when he was at a close enough 
proximity, he tried angrily to stab Johnny. With this captain came a 
hawkish eyesight, and Johnny quickly took note of the addition to the 
battle, Dust whipped up around his ankles as Johnny leapt into the 
air, bounding clear over the guard&#146;s smoothly bald head. Johnny landed 
on the other side of the guard, and grinned lazily as he re-sheathed 
his sword. 

The guard blinked in surprise when he *again* didn&#146;t see Johnny draw 
his blade. Then he shrieked in pain as the gash on his right shoulder 
dribbled out the crimson water of destruction.

Johnny nudged up his hat. &#147;Geez, I didn&#146;t wanna hurt anyone, but you 
guys are so persistent! Next time we meet, can you learn a bit more 
grace? You&#146;ll thank me someday.&#148;   

The captain of the May ship turned around hastily as he heard a few 
casual chuckles behind him. Five more guards, similar to the two that 
Johnny took out, appeared. One socked his fist into his palm, and 
loomed over Johnny with a devious look of amusement pasted across his 
rubbery lips.

&#147;You wanna fight us, pretty boy? You think that piece of tinfoil is 
gonna stop me as easily as it did them?&#148; The guard said.

Again Johnny smiled away his misgivings. &#147;Try not to talk, buddy. Let 
your limp fist do that.&#148;

**********

April and May were at the back of the corrupt politician&#146;s manor, and 
slowly climbed over the steel fence. Once they made it over, the two 
made a dash for the main building, across the rear gardens. They had 
to move fast because there was a chance that Johnny didn&#146;t get 
everyone&#146;s attention. After the short run, May and April slid up to 
the rear wall of the mansion. April&#146;s eyes darted around for some kind 
of entrance, until May pointed at a tiny door carved into the ground 
beside the house. 

The two pirates walked over to the small wooden door, and smashed it 
in. The small path was tight, but it seemed to lead down into the 
basement. April had a few doubts about using this method to get down 
to the basement, but May&#146;s inquisitive and dedicated nature did fail 
her, as she pushed April down the gap. May followed after her, and the 
two slid down a short path, landing in a huge basket of what seemed to 
be laundry.  

May&#146;s head sprang up out of a sea of...panties?

May looked confused. &#147;Hey? Why is this laundry thing full of panties? 
I thought an old man lived here!&#148;

April gasped for air as pulled her head out of the pile of underwear.

&#147;What are you talking about?&#148; April asked. 

May held up a small bra. &#147;What do you think, silly? This place! It&#146;s 
filled with women&#146;s underwear!&#148;

April took the bra into her hand. &#147;Well, I guess this guy is a 
little...promiscuous...&#148;

May scratched her head absently &#147;What does that mean?&#148;

&#147;It means he&#146;s a skirt-loving pervert.&#148; April said bluntly. 

&#147;Oh well then maybe we should leave,&#148; May said. &#147;You know what they 
say, don&#146;t come a&#146; knocking if the room is rocking!&#148;

April frowned and leapt out of the iron panty basket, onto the cold 
floor of the basement. &#147;Don&#146;t be silly, May. We&#146;re here to rob him not 
to be considerate of his love life.&#148;

May followed suit. &#147;It was a joke, April. You need to loosen up, girl! 
Anyway lets hurry up and get the gold. This place gives me the 
creeps...&#148;

April and May agreed to hurry, and searched the basement for the gold 
that Johnny had told them about. Apparently, the politician had mined 
this gold illegally from a secret mine in South Africa. This was the 
best possible situation for the May ship&#146;s crew, because since this 
gold was obtained illegally, there was no way he could inform the 
police about it. That pretty much made this situation perfect.

After rummaging around in the old junk of the basement, May came 
across a very strange wall. It looked false...

May knocked on the wall once with the back her hand. &#147;Hey! This thing 
is fake!&#148; May waved over to April. &#147;April, come here I think I&#146;ve 
found the gold!&#148;

April quickly ran next to May. &#147;Where is it?&#148;

&#147;I think it&#146;s behind this wall.&#148; May said excitedly.
April thought to herself for a brief moment. &#147;It is, huh? You&#146;ll have 
to break it down, May.&#148;

The brunette grinned whilst cracking her knuckles. &#147;Heh, heh, heh! No 
problem!&#148;

May pushed her feet back and took on a fighting stance as her trusty 
anchor dropped down (again, don&#146;t ask me where from) into her waiting 
hands. After yelling out a fierce yet cute little battle cry, May 
swung her iron weapon into the wall with a brutal intensity. April had 
to cover her face for protection as the wall smashed apart under May&#146;s 
single attack. 

As the dust and rubble died down, the two realized that May was right. 
This wall was a fake. It had a thicker layer of rock behind it, rock 
that May obviously couldn&#146;t break as easily, but it was enough. 
Embedded in that rock was large steel safe.

&#147;This must be where he keeps the gold.&#148; April stated. 

&#147;Well then lets take it and get outta here.&#148; May said.

April nodded, and the two decided to knock down the steel door, since 
it was locked and there was no way break it apart. May once again 
grinned at the chance to use her powers for a second time. May stepped 
back slowly, and then rammed her shoulder full speed into the door. It 
shifted a little, but didn&#146;t topple over. May rammed it a second time, 
this time with a bit more effort. 

But luckily it was sufficient. The door broke from its hinges, and 
smashed the lock. April stared at May oddly. Despite her cute 
appearance and immature personality, the pirate girl was insanely 
strong. In fact, very few women had the kind of strength that May had. 
It made you wonder about May&#146;s roots...Anyway, the steel door 
collapsed and fell inwards, as this safe door led into a smaller, more 
compact room. 

April and May stepped in and took a look around. It was glittering. In 
the darkness was pure, freshly prepared gold. The two girls gasped as 
they took in the splendour of the sight before them. 

&#147;Whoa...&#148; May said in shock. &#147;That&#146;s a lot of gold, April...we can&#146;t 
carry all of it.&#148;

The chief advisor of the May ship whipped out a large brown sack that 
was tied to he back and walked over to the gold.

&#147;You&#146;re right.&#148; April said. &#147;Let&#146;s just take what we can.&#148;  

May nodded in conformation of that notion as April began to pick up 
chunk of raw gold and stuff them by the bucket load into her sack. May 
pulled out hers and did the same thing. As May&#146;s bag reached the full 
load a few minutes later, something interesting caught her eye.

On a tiny table, there was an unusual rose. It was white. White roses 
were a rarity in the 22nd century. In fact, they were so rare that 
they racked up in the millions in big city auctions. It was under a 
glass tube, probably to keep it fresh. May walked over to the rose and 
stared at it curiously.

&#147;April, come here and see this.&#148;
April dropped her sack and walked behind May. &#147;What is it? Are you 
forgetting that Johnny is out there fighting? Hurry up, Ma-...wait a 
minute...is that a white rose?&#148;

May nodded. &#147;Uh huh. I think so.&#148; 

&#147;You know what they say about those, don&#146;t you?&#148; May shook her head. 
She didn&#146;t. &#147;White roses are very rare. They used to call them &#145;love 
roses&#146;. They say that if you hand it to the one you love, you&#146;ll be 
bound to them for eternity.&#148;

May eyes twinkled over. &#147;Really? How romantic! I guess I should give 
this to-&#147;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; April asked enquiringly.

May blushed and looked away. &#147;...Nothing. It&#146;s fine.&#148;

April walked back over to her bag and put more gold inside. &#147;If you&#146;re 
gonna take it, take it. I want to leave. For some reason I am so 
hungry.&#148; 

May didn&#146;t notice what April had said to her, rather she removed the 
glass case that was coving the rose and took it into her hand.

{That&#146;s weird} May said. {Since when do question myself 
about...Johnny?} 

**********

Johnny wiped his brow of sweat as a fresh trio of guards emerged from 
the politician&#146;s lavish household. He had just defeated the five that 
had confronted him before and the two before them, now more were 
coming. As confident as Johnny was he didn&#146;t think he could keep this 
up much longer. One of the guards charged at him with that same 
movement. Johnny quickly jumped into the cool night air, gathered 
power into his sword, and with one single stroke, a stream of blazing 
fire charred the guard below him. 

The man yelled in pain and tumbled away, as Johnny landed once more, 
his sword already sheathed. A second man ran towards the blonde pirate 
with a burning anger. Not prepared to toy with these guys any longer, 
Johnny casually tossed a gold coin at the guard&#146;s eye.

&#147;Ow! Freakin&#146; moron! Fight like a man!&#148; The guard yelled.

The hulking brute made another pitch for Johnny, but once again, 
Johnny threw a coin, this time at the man&#146;s stomach. Then, just as 
Johnny was about let loose a can of sheer mayhem on this guy, a blue 
dolphin twirling in the air on his far right caught his attention. 

Johnny laughed in triumph. {That&#146;s May&#146;s signal. She and April got the 
gold!}

The chivalrous pirate didn&#146;t draw, but tossed a rose to the guard who 
was on his knees, and ran back towards the far gate. Only one of the 
brutes followed him, but even he was no match for Johnny&#146;s blistering 
dash, and struggled to keep up. In no time at all, Johnny was nearing 
the gate, and with one final, aerodynamic bound, Johnny sailed clear 
across the gate, and landed with pinpoint accuracy on the cold grass. 

&#147;You okay, Johnny?&#148; May asked.

Johnny dusted off his hat. &#147;No probs, May. This slick captain you see 
before you, can handle anything. So you got the gold?&#148; 

April nodded and brandished the fat bag of gold on her back. &#147;Yep. As 
much as we could carry.&#148;

&#147;Not a bad haul, girls!&#148; 
 
**********

Later on that night, the three were back on the May ship, and Johnny&#146;s 
jolly crew were happily celebrating in the sheer triumph of their 
mission. May walked over through the dorms to Dizzy&#146;s room. The pirate 
girl still felt a little guilty about denying Dizzy the opportunity to 
go on a heist, so she was ready to make it up to her. 

May was about to knock on the door to Dizzy&#146;s cabin, when she 
overheard something...

&#147;Please, stop it!&#148;

That was Dizzy&#146;s voice.

May quickly pushed open the door and lunged inside. &#147;Are you all 
right, Dizzy?&#148;

The pirate girl looked around the room to see Dizzy on her bed, with 
her pale hands clutching tightly to her head. May slowly walked over 
to Dizzy and gently laid a hand on her trembling shoulder. 

Dizzy leaned up and gasped. &#147;May?&#148; 

A worried look crossed May&#146;s face. &#147;Are you okay? Did you have a bad 
dream, or something?&#148;

&#147;Something like that.&#148; Dizzy said quietly. 

May put a reassuring arm around Dizzy&#146;s waist, and pulled the 
beautiful Gear closer to her. As easily as Dizzy&#146;s angst arose it 
quickly subsided, and she slowly dissolved into May&#146;s caring embrace. 
Just as Dizzy felt like falling asleep in May&#146;s arms, her ruby eyes 
caught sight of something in May&#146;s pocket. 

Dizzy pointed to May&#146;s pocket. &#147;What&#146;s that?&#148;

May looked down, and saw the love rose hanging out of her pocket. May 
quickly put it away, before Dizzy could ask any real questions. 

The pirate girl tried to ignore her blush. &#147;Nothing...it&#146;s nothing.&#148;
