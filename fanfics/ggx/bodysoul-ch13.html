<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 13 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Dizzy casually walked through the steel network of corridors that made 
up the May ship, towards the bridge and it&#146;s captain, Johnny. Though 
her initial aura was a relaxed one, Dizzy had been jumpy for a short 
while. Simply because she was afraid of running into May.

It had been one whole hour since May had attempted to make contact, 
but still, to Dizzy, it felt as though it were only three seconds ago. 
Everything was just happening so fast these days. And to be honest, 
Dizzy hadn&#146;t been coping extremely well. Not to a good standard at 
least. The fact that Dizzy was avoiding May rather than talking to her 
was showing this. It wasn&#146;t her fault; after all, Dizzy had never 
really had many problems of the heart to deal with. What more could 
you expect from a three year old?  However, below that mark of age, 
Dizzy carried a decent sense of right and wrong. Avoiding May wasn&#146;t 
necessarily erroneous, but it didn&#146;t fit in with the good side of her 
either. 

But as much as Dizzy wanted her best friend back, a dominant fear 
weighed her down. What could she say? What could May say? Even if they 
did rectify the...whole...kiss thing, what then? The Innocent Gear 
would never forget how much it hurt for May to run from her like that. 
May was the one person she trusted above all else...Dizzy put out all 
of her hopes, desires and feelings into that single kiss. Only to have 
May reject it so openly. Not even the blind hatred and disdain of the 
human surface dwellers could have done as much damage. Not by a long 
shot. 

Could Dizzy just get over that?

And what about May? If they did manage to reform their friendship, 
could May do that, perfectly calm and contented, knowing full well 
that Dizzy was head over heels in love with her? 

Needless to say, Dizzy doubted that. Especially after...

Dizzy shook her head. Anything to get her first kiss out of her head. 
No way did she have the strength to recycle that event in her head 
over and over again. Testament had once told her that to get over the 
pain of the past crimes he committed under Justice, he had to put all 
of those things behind him. And the crimson-eyed Gear started to 
seriously believe that was the only way to make herself feel better. 
Unfortunately that path meant losing her best friend.  

With that sullen thought cast adrift from her brain, Dizzy found 
herself at the stern steel door leading into the bridge. Uhr. It 
seemed like anywhere she went Dizzy was reminded of her kiss with May. 
That Rudder...

Shaking her head again, Dizzy gently pushed the door open and entered 
the bridge of the May ship to be greeted to the cheery smile of it&#146;s 
more than capable captain. 

&#147;Hey, Dizzy!&#148; Johnny said, his smile cast over his shoulder as both of 
his hands supported the ship&#146;s rudder.

Dizzy shyly smiled back. &#147;Hello, Mr Johnny.&#148;

Johnny&#146;s hand took a second to adjust his shades while he stared 
quizzically at Dizzy. &#147;What&#146;s all this &#145;Mr Johnny&#146; stuff? You&#146;re still 
doing that? Come on Dizzy you should just call me Johnny! Or Captain, 
whatever you prefer.&#148;

The Innocent Gear bowed politely in apology. &#147;I am sorry...Johnny.&#148;

Johnny grinned. &#147;Heh! Now that&#146;s more like it!&#148;

The captain of the May ship had a second to think about what he was 
going to say to Dizzy, he called over one of the other two crewmembers 
on the bridge to take control of the rudder. The ship girl did so, and 
soon after, Johnny led Dizzy over to a quieter section of the room. A 
section of the room not drowned out by the sound of the May ship&#146;s 
engines. 

&#147;So you called for me, Johnny?&#148;

Johnny nodded. &#147;Yep. Well...you see...you know that we lifted some 
gold in Berlin? Well the time has come for us to cash it in. As you 
know, we&#146;ll be landing in Fuzhou soon. That&#146;s were we&#146;re gonna cash in 
the goods. I&#146;m gonna oversee the whole thing, but some other 
crewmembers are coming with me. June&#146;s coming, she wants to visit this 
new restaurant, and May&#146;s gonna come.&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s heart clenched. Talk of May again. And it was coming from 
Johnny, too. Johnny didn&#146;t threaten her, not even in the least. In 
fact Dizzy liked Johnny very much. But a part of her still felt 
envious of Johnny for winning May affections. 

&#147;Who else is coming?&#148; Dizzy asked.

Hearing that, Johnny rested his hands on both of Dizzy&#146;s shoulders and 
gave her a genuine smile of caring. &#147;I want you to come along as 
well.&#148;

That came as a shock. It had been a good while since Dizzy had left 
the ship, and memories of the last time were still fresh in her mind. 
The things those people said to her...Dizzy was still far too young to 
understand the full extent of Justice&#146;s legacy, but she knew (from the 
books she had read and the stories told to her by Testament) that he 
was a bad person. So needless to say, when people called her a &#145;Second 
Justice&#146; and the like, it had an after effect on our blue haired 
heroine. The hot springs with...May did cheer her up though. That was 
the high point of the trip. The second time the ship landed since 
Dizzy joined the Jellyfish Pirates was for the mission in Berlin, to 
pick up the gold Johnny was presently talking about. Dizzy had wanted 
to go, but May had openly objected to getting Dizzy involved in a 
heist, so much so that May stayed back. At the time, Dizzy felt that 
she could handle it, but May still wasn&#146;t having any of that. 
Weird...it seemed as if all of Dizzy&#146;s activities (aside from cooking 
with June) involved May somehow. If the brunette wasn&#146;t a part of 
Dizzy&#146;s life, did that mean that she had no life on the May ship?

Dizzy tried not to think about it like that. Not now. She was a 
Jellyfish Pirate. Upfront and foremost. &#147;You desire me to accompany 
you?&#148;

Johnny nodded. &#147;Uh huh. It&#146;s up to you. You can stay if you want, but 
I&#146;d really like you to come along with us. Every once in a while 
you&#146;re feet need to touch soil, y&#146;know? I promise, nothing will happen 
like it did in Spain. You have my word as the captain of the May ship 
and the no. 1 chick magnet in the seven skies.&#148; 

Accepting that, Dizzy gently smiled. She was ready. &#147;I&#146;ll go, Johnny.&#148;

**********

Five minutes later, in the cafeteria of the May ship, May and April 
stood in the cafeteria line, one tray each, waiting for the latest 
cuisine June and Dizzy had cooked up. But while April was excited 
about getting something to snack on, all May could do was sigh 
unhappily. Dizzy wasn&#146;t even prepared to talk to her...and the look of 
heartbreak in her scarlet eyes...May had caused that...But was this 
how it was going to be? May losing her best friend over a stupid kiss? 
Every time May thought about that, it irritated her to no end. Why 
would Dizzy let something so insignificant get in between them?

As May chose the food that she wanted, April took note of the dejected 
look on her team-mates&#146; face. Something was really bothering her. And 
from that same look, April could tell it was something big. 

The two girls picked out their lunches and walked over to their usual 
table at the other side of the room. And while April dove in like 
there was no tomorrow, May&#146;s head leaned tiredly to one side, propped 
up by her arm, and she poked at the food on her tray. The chief 
advisor of the May ship took notice of this dejection yet again. 

So she brought it up. &#147;So are you gonna tell me what&#146;s bothering you?&#148;

May heaved a melancholy sigh. &#147;What do you mean...?&#148; 

&#147;Stop pretending,&#148; April said. &#147;I know when something&#146;s bothering 
you.&#148;

The brunette stopped playing with her food long enough to look April 
in the eye. &#147;Well...I...&#148;

&#147;Come on! Out with it!&#148; April said playfully. 

May looked April in the eye. &#147;Okay! Okay...but...can I just ask you, I 
have you ever felt like you didn&#146;t know how much something means to 
you unless you think you&#146;ve...lost it?&#148;

April thought for a second. &#147;Yeah sometimes. Why?&#148;

May squirmed internally as a mental image of Dizzy flashed through her 
brain. &#147;Well...I...&#148;

Before May could even start he sentence, the Innocent Gear in question 
strode into the cafeteria on the other side of the large room. And the 
pirate girl could feel her heart beat quickening with every step Dizzy 
took. 

Why was she feeling this way? 

As stated before, April wasn&#146;t oblivious to these things. May was 
staring at Dizzy the same way Dizzy used to stare at her. But the 
weird thing about it was that May looked desperate. Like she was ready 
to do something drastic which wasn&#146;t like her. May was always an 
easygoing kinda girl. 

Whatever was bothering May involved Dizzy somehow, April could feel 
it. So rather than fixate of May, April turned her gaze to Dizzy, and 
both April and May watched her get something to eat. After Dizzy was 
served lunch by one of the ship girls on duty, she turned around and 
looked for a place to sit. 

For the past two days, Dizzy ate lunch in the kitchens to avoid seeing 
May, but this time she felt like eating in the actual cafeteria. And 
as luck (or bad luck as it were) would have it, May was right across 
the room from her. 

April watched inquisitively as the two merely stared at each other, 
neither bothering to say or do anything. Until.

June called out to Dizzy from the table she and a few other girls were 
sitting at. &#147;Hey, Dizzy! Over here!&#148;

Taking one last look at May, Dizzy strode over to June&#146;s table and met 
the joyful smiling of the cook and her friends. 

April blinked fiercely as May&#146;s head lulled into a droop again. Now 
she *knew* something was wrong. 

April turned sharply to May. &#147;Alright girl, spill! What&#146;s going on 
between you two? Dizzy always sits with us.&#148;

May tried her hardest not to stare at Dizzy. &#147;Um...well...it&#146;s...we 
sorta...&#148;

April nudged a little harder. &#147;What? What is it?&#148; 

May&#146;s eyes looked up to April&#146;s with an indisputable look of worry. 
But for what reason should she be worried about Dizzy? 

&#147;Um...Dizzy and I...we...kinda...kissed a couple days ago...&#148; May 
said. 

More obviously then not, April looked...shocked. &#147;Oh my god...you 
and...you two kissed? Does that mean the two of you are in-&#147;

May cut off April sharply before she even went there. &#147;No! It&#146;s not 
like that...it&#146;s...it&#146;s not...&#148;

{...Looks like I&#146;m not the one she&#146;s trying to convince.} April 
thought. 

April looked at Dizzy. The blue haired Gear tried to hide it, but she 
didn&#146;t look any better than May did. But what was the problem? Kissing 
May was a good thing for Dizzy since she liked her, right? 
&#147;Well...she&#146;s avoiding you. That can&#146;t be good. Not now at least.&#148;

&#147;I...I miss her, April.&#148; May spoke in earnest. &#147;But she wont even talk 
to me...&#148; 

&#147;Well...what happened? Who kissed who?&#148; April asked.

That was a no-brainer. &#147;Dizzy kissed me. I panicked and then...I just 
sorta ran from her...&#148;
April&#146;s eyes flashed. No wonder Dizzy was avoiding her. &#147;You what? You 
walked away from her?&#148;

&#147;Well...she shocked me! What was I supposed to do?&#148;

April shook her head. &#147;Well for starters, you shouldn&#146;t have ran, May. 
If Dizzy liked you enough to kiss you then she probably put a lot of 
hope in it. By rejecting her like that...well you may have just lost 
her friendship as well as her love.&#148;

May&#146;s heart was set on fire. &#147;Dizzy loves me?&#148;

&#147;It was supposed to be a secret, but yeah, she does. Or at least she 
did. It&#146;s pretty obvious when you think about it. But I promised her I 
wouldn&#146;t say anything.&#148;

Hearing that, May&#146;s ebony black eyes narrowed. &#147;You knew that Dizzy 
had a thing for me this whole time and you didn&#146;t bother to say 
anything?&#148;

&#147;She told me not to. What was I supposed to say?&#148; April said. 

May pushed he tray to one side and let her head slump into her crossed 
arms. &#147;I guess so. I just don&#146;t know what I should do. I can&#146;t talk to 
Dizzy; she wont even let me near her. Now she and June are thick as 
thieves and...&#148;

April smirked quizzically at May. &#147;What are you talking about?&#148;

May&#146;s eyes narrowed as she looked over her shoulder to see June and 
Dizzy laughing at their respective table. &#147;June&#146;s been all over her 
for the past two days.&#148;

The chief advisor of the May ship tried to stifle her playful giggles. 
&#147;Um...May, are you by any chance...jealous?&#148;

The brunette&#146;s cheeks turned a fiery crimson. &#147;What?! Are you insane?&#148; 

Again, April tried not to laugh. &#147;I see. Well, if you wanna talk to 
her you should do it in a few hours time when we land in Fuzhou. 
Johnny did tell you that Dizzy&#146;s coming, right?&#148;

A part of May was still annoyed about that. But, Johnny was the 
captain of the May ship and he rarely made a wrong decision. If that 
was okay by him and Dizzy then, May wouldn&#146;t stand in the way.

&#147;Yeah...I know. She&#146;ll be okay with me there. I won&#146;t let anyone lay a 
finger on her.&#148;

May turned her head around again to look at Dizzy, with the cutest 
smile appearing on her face, to accompany her dark blush. And as she 
watched May stare at the cerulean haired girl, April couldn&#146;t help but 
laugh at the irony of the situation. 

The tables hade been reversed...

**********

Jam sighed breathlessly as she first laid eyes upon the former leader 
of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights, Ky Kiske. And as her eyes turned 
into two little hearts burning for this young man&#146;s body, the waiter 
next to Jam sweatdropped. 

Jam&#146;s heartbeat quickened with every second spent staring at Ky. &#147;Oh 
wow...he&#146;s so dreamy...&#148;

&#147;...Uh...Ma&#146;am?&#148; The waiter said.

Jam took no notice. &#147;Look at his eyes...he&#146;s so cute...&#148;

&#147;...Ma&#146;am?&#148;

&#147;I wonder what his name is...?&#148;

It was then that the waiter got irritated. &#147;Ma&#146;am!&#148;

But Jam had the bluntness to match it. &#147;What!?&#148; She said as her eyes 
snaked back to the waiter. 

The waiter pointed at the ramen bowl for a little more emphasis. &#147;Do 
you want me to tell him about the delay, or-&#147;

Jam cut the waiter off. &#147;No! I&#146;ll do it...a guy as hot as he is needs 
the best...&#148;

Taking another glance at her knight in waiting, Jam blindly handed the 
waiter the ramen bowl. &#147;Here. Take this and go season it with some 
ground pepper.&#148;

The waiter nodded. &#147;Yes Ma&#146;am.&#148;

With that guy out of the way, Jam straightened out her clothes to make 
herself look presentable. This man looked to be organized and polite. 
It might offend him for Jam to come out of her kitchen and not look 
good. Steeling herself with an iron resolve, the Chinese chef pushed 
the doors of her kitchen open and sauntered over to the mysterious 
blonde man&#146;s table. And beamed the most seductive smile the muscles in 
her face could generate.

Before long Jam was standing at Ky&#146;s table. Jam sighed again as she 
caught sight of that intense look of distance on Ky&#146;s face. However, 
he did look a little troubled. Nevertheless, if Jam had her way...

The Chinese girl coughed into her fist to arouse Ky&#146;s attention. And 
she was more than successful as Ky looked up at Jam inquiringly. 

&#147;May I help you?&#148; Ky asked.

Jam blushed. {He even sounds cute!}

&#147;Um...My name is Jam Kuradoberi, and I&#146;m the owner of this whole 
restaurant. I&#146;m sorry to say that there&#146;ll be a slight delay with the 
bowl of ramen that you ordered. I&#146;m really sorry if we have 
inconvenienced you in any way.&#148;

Ky smiled and shook his head. &#147;No, not at all. It&#146;s not important. I 
have the patience to wait. And I can see that you are rather busy at 
this point. Is your establishment always this hectic?&#148;

Jam sat down of the seat adjacent to Ky&#146;s. &#147;Yeah, it really is. I just 
wish I had more help in the kitchens...I have to oversee everything to 
make sure nobody screws up.&#148; Jam gazed into Ky&#146;s eyes and ran the tip 
of her finger along the table absently. &#147;So...what&#146;s your name? You&#146;re 
not one of my regulars, so...&#148;

&#147;My name is Ky Kiske. This is my first time sampling the foods of this 
nation, as you can imagine I am not familiar with Chinese cuisine.&#148;

Jam blocked out everything Ky said except for his name. &#147;Ky...&#148;

Ky looked back on Jam. &#147;Yes?&#148;

And Jam blinked in response. &#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;You just said my name. Is there a problem?&#148; Ky asked. 

Jam shook her hands. &#147;No, no! I...I was just thinking that...you have 
a really beautiful name...Ky...&#148;

Ky scratched his head awkwardly. &#147;Uh...thank you.&#148;

Whilst Jam settled back down into her silent worship of Ky, a large 
man from a neighbouring table walked up to Jam from behind, with an 
irate expression on his face. For the most part, Jam was completely 
oblivious to all that was occurring around her, focussing on the noble 
knight that sat before her.

The tall ruffian tapped Jam on the shoulder. &#147;Hey!&#148;

The ring haired girl scowled sharply as she looked back at him. &#147;What 
is it, can&#146;t you see I&#146;m talking?&#148;

The ruffian frowned. &#147;I&#146;ve been waiting for my fried rice and wontons 
for the past hour! When the hell am I gonna get served?! You think I 
give out my hard earned money for nothing?!&#148;

Jam shut her eyes in contempt. &#147;Pipe down, already. My staff will 
serve you when they&#146;re able to. Look around and you&#146;ll see that this 
isn&#146;t exactly the easiest of days. Just wait a little longer. Unless 
you&#146;re allergic to waiting.&#148;

&#147;Obviously you didn&#146;t hear me. I want my order now, or-&#147;

&#147;Or what?&#148; Jam pushed her seat back and rose up incensed by this man&#146;s 
demanding tone. She really didn&#146;t want to get in an argument with 
someone in front of Ky, but... &#147;I told you to wait. If you don&#146;t like 
that, I&#146;ll reimburse you and then you can get the hell out of my 
restaurant.&#148;

The ruffian got angry with every word spoken by Jam. &#147;Are talking to 
me like *that*, little girl?&#148;

Jam swivelled around to face the ruffian, taking note of the tone of 
his voice. The guy was looking for an excuse to throw a punch... &#147;You 
don&#146;t really wanna fight with little ol&#146; me, do ya? They say even the 
most beautiful flower can carry the deadliest poison...you &#145;aughta 
watch yourself, big guy...&#148;

The ruffian cracked his knuckles, at which point the crowds and 
customers of Jam&#146;s restaurant had stopped bantering and eating to 
watch the scene play out before them. 
&#147;You got some spunk for a chick, little girl...&#148; The ruffian said. 

Jam chuckled to herself. This big lug actually thought he could take 
her on. Narcissistic asshole...

&#147;You really do wanna fight with me, huh? Figures. You macho types are 
all alike. You reek of B.O and you can&#146;t dance worth a damn.&#148;

The large ruffian&#146;s anger peaked. &#147;What the hell did you say to me?!&#148;

Instantly the ruffian flung his calloused fist at a cocky (with good 
reason to be) Jam. But before it even reached into an inch of Jam 
proximity, a second hand shot out from nowhere and caught the man&#146;s 
fist in a powerful, iron grip. 

That hand belonged to Ky, and the young knight tightened his grip on 
the ruffian&#146;s fist. The man fell to one knee to smother the pressure, 
it was of no use. After the ruffian let out a yelp of pain, Ky 
relinquished a fraction of the strength of the grip. 

&#147;I do believe that hitting a woman under such circumstances is not 
good etiquette for a gentlemen. So kindly leave before I&#146;m forced to 
remove you.&#148;   

After letting go of the man&#146;s fist sharply, Ky pointed to the exit 
with Thunderseal. And the young ruffian ambled away in humiliation and 
defeat. Not prepared to waste another second of thought on that 
deadbeat, Ky returned his attentions to Jam.

&#147;Are you okay?&#148; Ky asked. 

Jam could have sworn the temperature of the room shot up. &#147;I...I&#146;m 
fine.&#148; The Chinese girl swooned. 

{I gotta get to know this guy better...I&#146;m gonna make Ky mine...}

**********

While sitting on the bed of her room at the Inn, Millia tightened the 
buckles that were strapped to her shirt over her breasts. After making 
sure they were tight enough, Millia fastened the band around her head 
to prevent her hair from splaying around outside of battle. The last 
thing she needed to worry about right now was losing a strand of her 
hair. It was one in the morning, but Millia Rage did not have the 
capacity to sleep. Things just didn&#146;t allow her to. Maybe it was her 
nerves, maybe it was anxiety of facing Zato, but Millia wasn&#146;t at all 
tired. The best thing she could think of to do now was to make sure 
she was fully prepared for her battle with Zato. 

Standing up, Millia took on a fighting pose and contorted her hair 
into the form of a dagger. Before long her javelin-like hair stabbed 
in and out of the air, in quick, strong lunges. Soon after those 
lunges became a blur of blonde stabs, barely visible to the naked eye. 

As blind as Zato was, his senses were sharp as a Japanese sword. There 
was no way that Millia could fool Zato into believing that her revised 
Lust Shaker was invisible. Still, any edge you could get was better 
than no edge at all.  

With all her Assassin training, Zato could still match it blow for 
blow. That would frighten even the toughest of assassins, but not 
Millia. Her resolve was strong enough to surpass her fears. 

Fears.

Millia could always feel a fear when Zato was near. However, for 
whichever reason, Millia was not as worried as she was before. 
Something changed after what Baiken had said to her the night before. 
Now she was prepared to take on her nemesis and end the war between 
she and Zato once and for all. 

The time had come to cleanse Zato-ONE&#146;s black soul. 

A knock came at the door. With prompt accuracy, the flaying tresses of 
Millia&#146;s blonde hair returned to its original composition. And after 
signalling for whomever it was to come in, Baiken stepped through the 
door with an incredulous smile.

&#147;Something wrong?&#148; Millia asked. 

Baiken let out a low chuckle. &#147;Heh, heh, heh...that idiot has left to 
take on Zato alone...&#148;

Millia&#146;s eyes flared. &#147;Venom&#146;s gone?&#148;

**********

The English Assassin stepped forwards past two makeshift wooden doors 
into the warehouse. Primarily, it was used for training younger 
recruits for the Chinese Guild, but had been abandoned since Zato&#146;s 
disappearance. Outside of the few old weapons obviously used for 
training, there was not much inside the large warehouse. In fact, the 
only thing that could be heard by Venom was the sound of his own feet 
clattering against the creaky floorboards.

Venom sighed. No sign of Zato. Not at all. Was his informant lying to 
him? If word had gotten out in the Organization that Venom had 
attempted to make contact with Zato, then this whole thing could have 
been a trap. 

Even so, with his snooker case in his hand, he was ready. If it meant 
his death, Venom would still stand by Zato. His ties to the 
Organization were not as strong as the ones that bind two friends.    

Just as Venom turned around to leave, Zato&#146;s aide de camp heard the 
distinct sound of the materialization of a shadow.

Venom turned around sharply. &#147;What...?!&#148;

Venom looked down to see a dark pool of swarming black shadows, and 
from that same pool, a black figure shot up into the air, morphing 
into the form of young man. 

A man known to the assassins and to the dead, as Zato-ONE. 

Venom was near speechless. After one whole year... &#147;Zato-sama...&#148;

Zato&#146;s thin lips moved in the same cold manner as they always did. But 
the omnipotent voice that followed was not Zato&#146;s.

Eddie sneered. &#147;What is it that you want? Do you seek purification?&#148; 

&#147;Zato...what has happened to you?&#148;

That being said, Zato&#146;s body fell limp, but before it fell to the 
ground, a slimy form of shadows slithered up Zato&#146;s living corpse and 
morphed into a semi-human shadow form. The form of Eddie.   

&#147;So you know the human personally do you?&#148; Eddie said. &#147;You must be 
one of his assassin friends come to save him have you? Deluded human.&#148;

Venom&#146;s eyes narrowed. &#147;No...you&#146;re not Zato!&#148;

Eddies&#146; sub-human shadow form dissolved back into the shadow puddle on 
the floor, and with that came the dark and brutal smile of the genuine 
commander of the Assassin Organization. 

&#147;So. You&#146;ve come...for me, have you Venom?&#148; That was no longer Eddie&#146;s 
voice...

Venom&#146;s quick temperament subsided as Zato&#146;s welcomed voice made 
itself known. &#147;Commander...&#148; Venom dropped the formalities. 
&#147;...Zato...I&#146;ve come to help you...but we must leave.&#148;

Zato chuckled lowly at Venom, eliciting a curious frown from the 
selfless assassin. &#147;Zato...?&#148;

The commander of the assassins placed his hands on his shoulders and 
sighed mockingly. 

&#147;Here you go getting full of yourself again,&#148; Zato started. &#147;I told 
you that no darkness exists in light. You didn&#146;t know? You&#146;re really a 
child, are you not? It shows, fool. You don&#146;t understand, do you? It&#146;s 
simple. And it&#146;s time. The moon is full and my stomach is full of your 
blood. Lets have a dance!&#148;

Venom tightened his grip on his snooker case. &#147;What are you talking 
about?&#148;

&#147;You should cut your hair you know! It&#146;s silly isn&#146;t it? Do you want 
to know what I&#146;m thinking? Lets go to Paris! We could kill people and 
eat some fish! You&#146;ll love it. Plus...I think some of these walls are 
talking. Don&#146;t ask me what they&#146;re saying, but I know!&#148;

Venom&#146;s eyes widened in realization. Zato had gone insane. His long 
time master had lost his mind. Venom couldn&#146;t believe it. The 
cool-headed, calculating, sharp as a razor assassin had lost his mind 
to the same shadows he thought he had control over. Venom could only 
shake his head in pity. 

&#147;Zato...&#148; Venom started. &#147;...Not you...&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s wrong? Look over there,&#148; Zato pointed to a small pot at the 
other side of the warehouse. Inside of it was a flower. &#147;I finally 
understand what they say now! I understand...we are all destined from 
birth...to die lonely deaths...the rose said so. And now I&#146;m waiting 
for the one who can deliver my death...she&#146;s coming soon...but still, 
I&#146;ll do something for you as a thanks for your trouble.&#148;   

The English assassin cursed in shock as the shadows around Zato&#146;s 
ankles warped into three demon-headed dogs and knocked him clear 
across the warehouse. The only thing that slowed Venom down was the 
impact of him slamming into a brick wall, with a loud thud, that 
echoed into the dark warehouse. 

Zato sneered. &#147;I&#146;ll thank you by killing you. It is the greatest gift 
I can offer. After all, what greater freedom is there then death?&#148;

Though the force of the blow was immense, Venom had not let go of his 
snooker case. Already shaken, Venom stood up with deeply ingrained 
vigor. Zato was right. There was no greater freedom then death. And if 
meant his freedom, Venom would gladly be the one to bring about Zato&#146;s 
demise. 

Piercing Zato with a sturdy gaze, Venom opened his carrying case and 
brought forth the power of his mighty weapon. Fixing his snooker cue 
together in tight formation, Venom then channelled all of his fighting 
power into this one battle. Something told Venom that he was in for 
the battle of his life.   

Venom mumbled under his breath. &#147;I&#146;ll save you...my friend.&#148;

In no time at all, Venom shot out a kinetic ball of spherical power, 
one that directed itself straight for Zato&#146;s living corpse. Just as it 
neared him, Zato called upon his shadows to defend him, and a black 
shield covered the front of his body to protect himself. As the ball 
shattered, Zato used his senses to guide him to Venom&#146;s location, but 
his head jerked up in confusion when her realized that Venom was in 
the air. 

Venom yelled a fierce cry of passion as he shot out a second ball from 
his aerial position. But rather than block it like he had done with 
the previous attack, Zato let his shadows surround him entirely, and 
darted forwards like a true to life demon. While he moved, Zato&#146;s 
cat-like senses picked up on Venom&#146;s expected landing point and 
unluckily for Venom, that prediction was accurate. And as Venom looked 
down as he landed, he could quite clearly see a dangerous shadow 
forming into a drill. With a scratch of momentum, Venom hurled himself 
backwards as far as he could, to avoid the attack. By the forces of 
lady luck, Venom escaped the drill, but the forces of gravity gave him 
a hard landing on the dusty floorboards of the warehouse. The assassin 
had no time to rest though, and quickly scrambled to his feet. 

Then Venom looked around. Zato was nowhere to be seen. And he couldn&#146;t 
hear anything either. Nothing but the calming yet evocative sound of 
dust rustling on the floor. But he was trained assassin. He had the 
patience to wait. Rather than search with his eyes, Venom took a 
moment to pause and stilled his body. To become aware of the presence 
of your target, you have to lose focus of your surroundings and 
yourself, and focus on nothing more than the target. In a (delayed) 
flash, Venom felt something from...

Right beneath him?

No sooner after that was thought, a shadowy force shaped like a 
buzzsaw hacked through the meek floorboards with a maddening, 
ripping-like force, and attempted to slice Venom&#146;s body in two.  Venom 
dove out of the way to avoid Zato&#146;s attack. After taking a second bad 
dive, Venom hoisted himself onto his feet using his snooker cue for 
leverage.  

In spite of the situation, Venom still had the ironic bravery to 
slowly chuckle at the situation. Nobody said this was going to be 
easy. Zato wasn&#146;t the commander of the Assassin Organization for 
nothing. A meagrely short distance away from Venom was Zato, with a 
mocking grin on his pale face. 

&#147;Not bad. But you&#146;re far too defensive and evadingly inclined. Ironic. 
For such a &#145;capable&#146; assassin, you&#146;re very restrained, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

As a show of how &#145;restrained&#146; he was, Venom fired another shot at 
Zato, to cause a distraction for a more effective attack. A fact that 
Zato didn&#146;t pick up on. But that didn&#146;t matter. In one sleek move, 
Zato dove his hands into his symbiotic shadow and pulled out a thin 
but protective layer of shadow to act as a shield for a brief period 
of time. As soon as Venom&#146;s attack hit the shield, its black energy 
reflected the ball to have it thrown right back at Venom. The English 
assassin gasped and quickly shot another blast to counter the previous 
one. In a bright flash of power, the two balls collided with one and 
other, and Venom decided to use that bright flash to his own 
advantage. 

But the confusion from Zato&#146;s arrival must have clouded Venom&#146;s 
judgement, because Zato easily tracked Venom&#146;s movements. Zato sighed. 
A foolish mistake for one of his old allies to make. Unbeknownst to 
his error, Venom filled with adrenalin made a dash for Zato from his 
right. Twirling his fighting stick around and around repeatedly in 
cycle of rapid, destructive blows, Venom rushed forwards for a more 
blunt attack. Even as Venom neared him, Zato didn&#146;t flinch or move. He 
remained as he was. Still. And as his attack reached within inches of 
Zato&#146;s actual head, Venom realized the error that he just made. Zato 
&#145;broke the law&#146; and sunk into his nightmarish pool of shadows, with 
Venom&#146;s attack merely flashing past that puddle and this left his back 
*wide* open. 

The Spanish killer then rose up from the shadow puddle to reassume his 
humanoid form once again. And with a clear opening, Zato pulled his 
arms up in arc form, his shadow following suit causing a gigantic claw 
shaped shadow to rise up in unison. 

Venom could only grit his teeth in agony as the shadow claw sliced at 
his open and revealed back, rending flesh as easily as a hot knife 
through butter. Ignoring the pain he obviously felt, Venom said 
nothing as he turned around to face Zato again. But gasped when Zato 
appeared right in front of him. Out of reflexive instinct, Venom 
raised his snooker cue to shoot out an additional sphere, but there 
was little time. In an instant, Zato&#146;s shadow took on the form of a 
snapdragon, and it bit wildly at Venom&#146;s stomach, scraping up and 
slicing away at Venom&#146;s naked flesh. The English assassin still had 
the resolve to fire his attack, and shot out another one of his 
trademark moves. This was too close for Zato to deflect or avoid, and 
to avoid a sharp blow to the chest, he leaned to the side as fast as 
he could. The ball rammed sharply into Zato&#146;s right shoulder, tearing 
away at his open skin, as the ball remained intact.  

Zato clutched his shoulder by reflex, and slid back, away from Venom 
to put a bit of distance between the two. Venom could only stare at 
Zato. He was fighting very differently then he used to. He usually 
tried to end a fight rather quickly, now Zato appeared to be dragging 
this out. But for what? Venom saw no sense in that. Unless...Zato was 
taking him lightly. The thought more of Zato than that. If that was so 
then Venom would not hold back any of his power. Zato noticed the 
change in Venom&#146;s deportment, and as a result, summoned a little 
friend...

A small shadow shaped like a demon crawled along the floor towards 
Venom from Zato&#146;s shadow. Seeing this, Venom leapt into the air and 
gathered all of his strength, resolve and will into one single second. 
Then he used that momentum to fire a mid-air stream of spherical 
kinetic balls at Zato. In a hailstorm of striking balls, Zato smirked 
cockily and sunk back into his pool of shadows. The roar of Venom&#146;s 
powered attack fell on deaf ears as each of the balls blasted away at 
the ground and all but Zato. As the attack ended, Venom scowled in 
frustration and began his decent downwards. But what he didn&#146;t realize 
was that the demon shadow that he previously avoided had not 
disappeared yet. Rather than that it remained stationary, in a sort of 
a landmine shape. A landmine ready to go off. 

Then Venom&#146;s eyes widened in pure shock as a HUGE drill materialized 
from the shadow landmine. There was absolutely no way Venom could 
fully avoid it, but he used every ounce of power within his soul to 
avoid the drill from hitting a critical point of his body. Venom 
managed roll midair to his side, and the massive drill cut through the 
right side of his unprotected stomach. The shadow drill skewered 
Zato&#146;s aide de camp, tearing his flesh apart as the drill sunk deeper 
and deeper into Venom&#146;s insides. A jolt of searing pain erupted around 
Venom&#146;s body and for a blind emphasis, he screamed out in pure 
suffering. The assassin lost all focus, so much so that he dropped his 
snooker cue to the ground. After a few more seconds of unrivalled 
agony, Zato&#146;s blood soaked drill slowly dissolved, pulling itself free 
from Venom&#146;s limp body. 

Venom fell lifelessly to the ground, in an ugly thud. His hair was now 
stained pink from all the blood her had coughed up. Using weak limbs, 
Venom placed both hands on the ground and pushed up. Venom tried 
desperately to stand with the last reserves of his power, and with all 
his might he succeeded in doing so, but his balance was unstable. And 
his vision was becoming blurry. 

Venom then started to realize that this was it. He&#146;d die unless he did 
something. He&#146;d die at the feet of his own benefactor. Unless...he 
acted, hard and fast. Slowly, Venom walked towards his cue, and 
clasped it weakly in a hand stained by his own blood. The ashen haired 
assassin stared at Zato. Venom wasn&#146;t doing this for himself. He was 
doing this for Zato. This was his task and a task only he could 
perform. 

With a desperate but strong resolution, Venom made a wave like motion 
with his hand, and cut open a tear into a different dimension. And out 
from that momentary rip in space and time came a gargantuan sphere of 
burning, crystal red energy, powerful enough to cut through mountains. 
Zato merely grinned as the large powerball neared him. There was no 
fear on the face of this madman however, only the amusement of a good 
challenge. A hors d&#39;oeuvre before the main course. Zato arrogantly 
splayed out his arms and openly welcomed the attack. Though it may 
have seemed to be foolishness, it was not misplaced as Zato brought 
his arms forward and a shadow version of his arms copied him. Then 
those same shadow hands placed themselves on Venom&#146;s gigantic ball of 
power. The two hands pressed hard against the burning hot power of the 
attack, so much power that the floorboards beneath Zato started to 
crack. Zato gritted his teeth hard, the Dark Angel was no picnic, but 
soon, even though Zato was straining, Venom realized something. Zato&#146;s 
shadows were not holding off the massive ball of crimson power...

They were compressing it.

Then, defying all logic, Zato&#146;s shadows hands shattered the Dark Angel 
into tiny little pieces of crystallized energy. And those same shards 
of crystal disbanded and faded way. Almost as if they had never 
existed. 

Venom fell to his knees in despair, and agony from his wound. He was 
powerless to help Zato now. He really did need Millia&#146;s help after 
all. His best attack was defeated so easily...

Zato could only laugh maniacally. &#147;It took me a while to break it! 
Sorry I was a little bit rusty this time. Still, I can&#146;t let you go 
now.&#148;

Venom closed his eyes and fought back a slight tear. &#147;Zato...I am so 
sorry.&#148;

Then Venom saw nothing but black as Zato screamed out the word, 
&#145;Amorphous&#146;.

**********

Millia and Baiken ran to the warehouse that Venom had pointed out to 
them in the hopes of catching up with him. As they reached the creaky 
wooden doors, Millia pushed them apart and the two women stepped 
warily into the warehouse. The musky stink of blood was the first 
noticeable attribute to the place, and it was fresh too. 

Millia caught sight of something in the middle of the hall. &#147;Baiken, 
look.&#148;

Baiken&#146;s eye zoned in on the sight. It was Venom, lying face down in a 
small pool of blood that appeared to be his own. And as the two began 
to walk over to his inactive body, a small puddle zipped under 
Millia&#146;s feet.

&#147;What?!&#148; A shadow fist shot out of the puddle and attempted to hit 
Millia. Using her hair as a defence, Millia blocked that attack and 
jumped backwards slightly. Then out of the puddle of shadows came the 
tormented body of Zato, clutching his head and seething in pain. 

&#147;MILLIAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!&#148;

Millia felt her bones chill to the very marrow. &#147;Zato...&#148;
