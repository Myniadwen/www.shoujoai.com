<pre>Authors Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the Kaiser here. I decided to write a Shoujo-ai fanfiction 
about Guilty Gear X when I realized that almost all the Guilty Gear 
fanfictions out there are around the Sol/Ky shounen-ai pairing. So, 
enjoy. This part is short though, but more will come I promise.

As usual with my work:

{}= Thoughts
&quot;&quot;= Speech
-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;You betrayed him &#133;&quot;

&quot;No&#133; He betrayed me. He made me into something I did not want to 
be&#133;&quot;

&quot;And for that you allowed him to be possessed by a shadow?&quot;

&quot;But&#133;.&quot;

&quot;He was your master. He helped bestow you with your enormous power&#133;&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want the powers of a killer. I didn&#39;t want to be an 
assassin.&quot;

&quot;So you abandoned your master, cost him his freedom&#133; and let a shadow 
claim him.&quot;

&quot;Zato-ONE destroyed my life! He stained my hands with the blood of 
the innocent. His organization has sent dozens of his lap dogs after 
me, and forced me to live as a recluse, unable to even interact with 
others!&quot;

&quot;You betrayed your master.&quot;

&quot;No&#133; he betra&#133;&quot;

&quot;You have forsaken your master Millia Rage!!!!!&quot;

Millia awoke with a start, rising quickly off of the bed. Panting 
heavily, she looked over to the window of the ramshackle city inn she 
was sleeping in. It was still dark. It was too early to move on now. 
If she stayed though, she could be found by some of the assassin 
organization&#39;s hit men. Indecision forced her to stay put&#133; if she 
moved now, she knew for some reason that she would regret it. But she 
couldn&#39;t go back to sleep now&#133; that dream would attack her again&#133; 
Ever since she defeated Zato-ONE at the international fighting 
tournament where he was possessed by that demonic shadow&#133; she had 
been plagued by those dreams. Dreams, which told her that she, were 
the direct cause of it. And that she was truly the evil one&#133; for 
allowing that to happen to her master&#133; and it drove her insane. Zato-
ONE was the same character that made her into a fugitive&#133; that made 
her into a killer... he etched a legacy of blood into her soul that 
could never be gotten rid of. 

Scowling at the that direction on her thoughts were taking, 
Millia&#39;s hair distorted into the shape of a hand, snaking out across 
the room to the far table, grasping the glass of water the lay there, 
and brining into back to her, Millia&#39;s hair returning to its normal 
consistency. The glass dropped in her hand, and the blonde recluse 
gulped it down hard, throwing it away after finishing it of its 
bounty. Millia stared into the shards of glass that it had shattered 
into&#133; broken and destroyed&#133; just like her spirit&#133; forced into 
nothingness&#133; stark depression forced the unwilling assassin into one 
conclusion&#133; 

&quot;To end this nightmare&#133; I must finish him off&#133; once and for all&#133;&quot;

**********

Just a few miles away in a bustling bar, was Baiken Seishino. The one 
eyed, one-armed Japanese survivor was at the bar side, drinking a 
bottle of Sake. Baiken looked around herself at the people and 
snarled at them&#133; dancing, laughing, singing. So frivolous and care 
free, as though the Gears never existed&#133; as though the earth had 
never had never been under one hundred years of brutal war&#133; 
The attitude of these people annoyed her to great extent. She 
had witnessed the Crusades and so had these people, yet they delight 
in enjoying themselves, making a mockery of the spirits of the dead&#133; 
all around us now&#133; The cerise haired samurai stood off of the bar 
stool and was about to leave, sickened by the sight before her, until 
a particularly load mouthed Ninja stood in her way&#133; Baiken looked at 
the boy. White spiky hair, crimson red eyes, a mocking look of 
contempt eternally forged onto his face, a large, sleek blade and the 
end of his gauntlet. She squinted her eye a bit, and looked closer at 
him&#133; he was in the International Fighting Tournament&#133;.

&quot;You there, woman! I challenge you here and now as a fellow Japanese, 
I think I deserve the right to a dual, to honour my master 
Tsuyoshi!!&quot;

Baiken smirked at the boy, recognizing his name.

&quot;You&#39;re Chipp Zanuff, are you not?&quot;

The young Ninja snapped his knuckles and looked around the bar as he 
stepped backwards.

&quot;Follow me. We have to have a lot more space to battle each other!&quot; 

Baiken looked at him closely, and turned away. Normally she would 
have been happy to fight this man, but right now she just didn&#39;t feel 
like it. The ignorance of today&#39;s humanity was appalling. Maybe 
Justice did have a point about it&#133; Chipp&#39;s eyebrow rose as Baiken 
turned her back to him, and he grabbed her shoulder. The cerise 
haired samurai glanced back at him again. Obviously this guy had a 
death wish&#133;

&quot;Get your hand off of my shoulder before my sword does it for you.&quot; 
She hissed.

Chipp just grinned and gripped her ever tighter. If this woman were 
even half as powerful as she was six months ago, she would provide 
perfect training, and a chance to test out his new abilities&#133;

&quot;Not until you agree to fight me Baiken Seishino&#133; we must do all we 
can to honour our proud country of Japan!&quot;

Baiken&#39;s eyes flared at that statement. This boy obviously lacked 
brains but he certainly made up for it in arrogance and foolishness&#133; 
and he would pay for that&#133; Baiken immediately jerked her shoulder out 
of his grip and turned to face him. Chipp adopted a fighting stance 
and smiled in victory. Suddenly it didn&#39;t seem to matter weather he 
fought Baiken in or outside, as long as he could&#133; 

&quot;Alright, with my master watching me from heaven, there is no way I 
can lose! Come on! Lets see how you wield that fancy little sword 
just seconds before I break it in two!&quot; 

The cerise haired samurai spat on the ground, and let her hand slip 
to the hilt of her sword&#133;

&quot;OYA!!!!!!&quot;

As if by lightning, Baiken drew her sword and made shallow swipe at 
the cocky little poser, but her attack fell short, as Chipp was 
nowhere to be seen. Baiken raised an eyebrow as she sheathed her 
sword, and looked around for the ninja.

&quot;Looking for me?&quot; 

Baiken instantly turned around to see Chipp behind her, smiling, and 
more insultingly, with his guard down. People now started to crowd 
around the pair of them and take in what was going on. The herald of 
Tsuyoshi smirked at a now angry Baiken, and taunted her. 

&quot;How did you like my master&#39;s skill, the Tsuyoshi Shiki Teni? Does my 
blistering speed frighten you Seishino? So it should! Prepare to kiss 
my ass woman&#133; I won&#39;t hold back!&quot;

Baiken just smiled, closing her eye and let out a dying sigh. 

&quot;Don&#39;t mock me&#133; Gamma Blade!!&quot;

Baiken&#39;s eye opened as she heard Chipp call an attack, and gracefully 
leaped into the air to avoid an energy silhouette of the ninja. Not 
to be outdone, Chipp leapt into the air also, following Baiken. The 
spiky haired man threw a kick at the cerise haired samurai, who 
swiftly avoided it. The two then landed on the floor at the same 
time, smirking at each other. 

Chipp stood up and let his guard down again, laughing at the samurai.
&quot;Heh, heh, heh! Not bad Seishino! Maybe one day you could be as fast 
as me!&quot;

Baiken smiled, and let her gaze direct itself to Chipp&#39;s shoulder&#133;

&quot;Take a look at your shoulder boy.&quot; 

Chipp stopped laughing, and looked at his shoulder. The fabric of his 
shirt had been slashed open somehow, and it was stained with a 
haunting crimson&#133; Chipp gaped at the slash; his mind reeling with 
sudden revelations.

{But wait a minute? When did she slash at me? In the air? But how? No 
one is as fast as&#133;}
&quot;Mistake number one!! Sanzu Watashi!!!&quot;

Chipp clicked back into focus as soon as he heard Baiken call out her 
attack, but it was too late. Baiken immediately rammed into the 
ninja, knocking the breath right out of him, and he screamed in pain 
as Baiken&#39;s sword slashed at him three times, each blow progressively 
more damaging then the last. The final one was strong enough to knock 
Chipp right away, and sent him flying through the crowds and onto a 
pine wood table, splitting it in half as his weight and the force of 
the blow smashed down on it. 

&quot;Uh&#133;uh&#133;oh&#133;&quot; Chipp groaned in agony, dizzy and disoriented, only 
stopping his gasps for breath as Baiken stood over him, with her 
sword perched dangerously close to his neck. The cerise haired 
samurai scowled at him. He talked a good game but came up short. 
Typical poser&#133;

&quot;You little punk! Don&#39;t you ever, EVER call my nation&#39;s name in vain 
again, or I swear by Kami-sama my sword will drink your blood&#133; You 
hear me? Now get out of here!&quot;

The now humiliated Chipp nodded slowly, and crawled out of the 
wreckage of the bar table, and exited the bar altogether. Baiken 
spat on the ground again, sheathing her sword. People started to 
crowd around her, and the cerise haired samurai chose to leave, 
before she caused any more problems. She had actually expected 
someone to call her to pay for the damage, but no one did&#133;
The cerise haired samurai stepped out of the bar and onto the 
cold, harsh street. Looking up at the stars, her eye narrowed.

&quot;I&#39;ll find you. And kill you for what you did to me&#133;&quot;

**********

&quot;May! Hurry up, goddamn it! I knew you should have stayed on the May 
ship!&quot;

Johnny&#39;s sword slashed through thick vines and branches, as he and 
May made their way through the thickets and vines, leading up to the 
place called the Grotto, where the still functioning, self reliant 
Gear made it&#39;s home. This had taken the best part of an hour, and May 
kept on whining about it every three seconds and his best hat had 
been destroyed in the process, but he had to find this Gear. If he 
was going to be anything like his father, he had to save her, before 
some crude bounty hunter came looking&#133;&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m coming Johnny! Wait a minute&#133;&quot;

May kneeled over for a second, resting her large anchor on the ground 
and wheezed a bit. May knew Johnny wanted to the bounty on this Gears 
head, but still coming out all this way for 500,000 world dollars? It 
wasn&#39;t that much&#133; Johnny stopped slicing the vines and branches in 
the way, and knelt next to the auburn haired pirate, wrapping her arm 
around her.

&quot;Hey, you okay? You sure this isn&#39;t too much for you?&quot; Johnny asked, 
the concern unhidden from him and May. 

May looked up at Johnny and cutely smiled. &quot;Nah, not as long is I&#39;m 
with you Johnny!&quot;

The chivalrous pirate nodded, helped May up, and drew his sword to 
slash at the foliage again, but stopped as he saw the clearing. May 
and Johnny stood in awe as they laid eyes on the Grotto. A 
beautiful, serene and tranquil place, surrounded by marble arches, 
and ponds of crystal water, with so many furry little animals running 
around the place. It was quiet and calm, it made you feel safe to be 
there, and at it&#39;s centre, was the woman who the Union of Nations 
considered the most dangerous Gear alive today&#133; May slung her anchor 
over her shoulder and stared at the girl&#133; She was sitting down; her 
legs folded beneath her, playing calmly with two cute, furry little 
animals.

{She doesn&#39;t seem bad to me&#133;she&#39;s really kinda&#133; cute&#133;}

May blushed at that thought, and quickly nudged at Johnny, who was 
still marvelling at the Grotto.

&quot;Are you sure that&#39;s the girl you&#39;re looking for? She doesn&#39;t look 
dangerous Johnny.&quot;

Johnny&#39;s face contorted into confusion. May was right; she didn&#39;t 
look dangerous at all. But the report did state that the Gear didn&#39;t 
attack anyone unprovoked. Sheathing his sword, the chivalrous pirate 
grinned, 

&quot;Well, she&#39;s good looking! That&#39;s a very good start. Come on lets go 
and talk to her.&quot;

&quot;Uh huh!&quot;

May and Johnny walked carefully over to the young woman, as not to 
disturb her. After they came close, the squeak of May&#39;s shoes caused 
the self reliant Gear&#39;s head to jerk up. May and Johnny stopped 
walking, as the Gear turned head around and looked at them, her gaze 
intensely searching, probing for something&#133;

&quot;Who are you&#133; what are you doing here&#133;?&quot;

Johnny blinked. &quot;Hey, hey take it easy&#133; we&#39;re not gonna hurt you. We 
just want to help&#133;&quot;

May turned to Johnny in confusion. &quot;Wait a minute, I thought you 
wanted the cash&#133;.&quot;

&quot;Shush May!&quot; Johnny said, looking back to the Gear, &quot;We really just 
want to help you&#133;&quot;

The Gear stood up, ushering the animals she was playing with away, 
and ripped her clothes of to reveal her transformed, super Gear body. 
The Gear looked in between the two of them, not angry, just 
disheartened&#133; why couldn&#39;t humanity leave her alone. May stepped back 
in fear, just behind Johnny, and the chivalrous pirate held an arm in 
front of himself, waving it in his defence.

&quot;Please leave. I don&#39;t want Necro and Ariel to destroy you but I 
won&#39;t be captured again.&quot; The Gear said, the two wings on her back 
spreading outwards. 

&quot;Hey&#133; look&#133;&quot; Johnny said, quite nervous all of a sudden, &quot;We&#39;re 
telling the truth&#133; we don&#39;t wanna attack you or anything it&#39;s just 
that, I heard what you were going through, and we wondered if we can 
help? I know some of the&#133; humans who were after you were like that, 
but May and me aren&#39;t. You see I lead a crew called the Jellyfish 
Pirates. We help the less fortunate like yourself, and I wanted to 
ask you to join us.&quot; Johnny suddenly became serious when he added, 
&quot;We don&#39;t want you to suffer anymore than you already have.&quot;

The Gear looked at Johnny for a second, then May who was behind him, 
and back to Johnny again.

&quot;So you mean&#133; you want to be around me&#133; but you don&#39;t want to hurt 
me? But you are humans&#133;&quot;

May then stepped forward from behind Johnny, and smiled for a second, 
calmly and cautiously steeping towards the Gear, dropping her anchor 
and standing bashfully in front of her. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that Johnny wanted to save you but if he says that, 
then it&#39;s definitely true! Johnny will never steer you wrong! And 
plus I&#39;m here, so you don&#39;t need to be afraid of us.&quot;

The Gear stared at May for a second, and then retracted her wings.

&quot;You want me to go with you?&quot; The Gear said.

May moved next to her, resting her long arm around the Gear&#39;s 
shoulders, and hugged her gently.

&quot;Yep! Anybody that Johnny likes, I like. And besides, you can&#39;t stay 
here. It&#39;s cold and kinda creepy in a nice way. So are you gonna come 
with us or what?&quot;

The Gear looked at May, and blushed a bit. She did seem genuinely 
nice for a human&#133;

&quot;Yes&#133;&quot;

Johnny and May smiled in approval of her decision, and the chivalrous 
pirate went over to the Gear, holding her hand, nudging his sword to 
the floor.

&quot;So miss, do you have a name?&quot; Johnny asked.

The Gear nodded. &quot;Yes. My name is Dizzy&#133;&quot;

Just over the Grotto, on a ledge over looking the whole forest, a 
mysterious character teleported on to the scene, wielding a long, 
blood red scythe. He looked down at Dizzy, with what appeared to be 
her two new (first) friends, and smiled in approval. The crow that 
was flapping next to him, transformed in to a young spirit of a 
woman, looking down on Dizzy, May and Johnny also. 

The spirit snorted. &quot;Testament, why let her go? With humans?&quot;

&quot;Because I fight to protect her Zio. Not to keep her here against her 
will. Maybe it is time for her to leave the Grotto. She will be fine 
with the humans. Now, what were you saying about Kliff Undersn?&quot;

**********

It was finally a new day. Millia Rage was walking across a dirt path 
in the middle of the grasslands, just outside of the city she rested 
in. It was hard enough to go through this thing with Zato, but to 
have to continuously move around again and again, was taking it&#39;s 
toll on Millia&#133; she had to find Zato soon, and kill him. It was the 
only way she could she could see to end this. 

{That Zato&#133; I will destroy him. I defeated him in the tournament, I 
can do it again&#133; and this time&#133; nothing will stop me&#133; nothing&#133; you 
will pay Zato-ONE&#133;}

As Millia stopped thinking, a woman bumped into her, and Millia 
almost shoved her out of the way. The woman blinked and looked back 
at Millia, who continued to walk away, only saying,

&quot;Watch where you&#39;re going.&quot;

&quot;Watch where I&#39;m going? Do you realize that you just shoved Baiken 
Seishino out of your way?!&quot; Baiken said angrily. 

Millia looked back, and studied the women&#133; she seemed like she had 
been through a war&#133; one arm, one eye, and yet she was still a 
swordsman&#133; Millia frowned indifferently, and continued to walk away. 

&quot;I don&#39;t give a damn who you are. You should learn to watch 
yourself.&quot;

Millia kept on walking, until she heard the sound of a sword 
unsheathing&#133; Millia turned around to see Baiken with her sword drawn, 
flashing a defiant smile at the unwilling assassin.

&quot;I sense the blood of a warrior&#133; am I right?&quot;

Millia frowned. &quot;I don&#39;t have time for this.&quot;

Baiken stepped forwards, keeping the sword in the position it was in. 
Millia said nothing, not moving an inch, as Baiken&#39;s sword neared her 
throat, so close that the tip of the blade was only a few centimetres 
away from touching her skin. Baiken then looked confused. One thrust 
and she could kill Millia, yet the young woman didn&#39;t even flinch, 
maintaining such a cool demeanour&#133; the cerise haired samurai&#39;s face 
darkened.

&quot;Well I think it&#39;s best that you make some time. I don&#39;t take well to 
people as rude as you.&quot;

Baiken immediately sliced Millia&#39;s cloak open, letting it fall around 
the blonde&#39;s ankles. It was more of an attempt to elicit a reaction 
rather than to intimidate Millia. But it failed, and Millia only 
stared at Baiken, her eyes frozen&#133;

&quot;Please. Don&#39;t force me to have to kill you&#133;&quot;

Kaiser&#39;s afterthoughts
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* More will come soon so don&#39;t worry
* I apologize to any Chipp fans out there, he isn&#39;t really that 
feeble, but I just can&#39;t stand the guy
* The wings on Dizzy&#39;s back. I only know the name of the darker one, 
Necro, so I made up the name &#39;Ariel&#39; for the other
* Tell me what if you like it, but don&#39;t flame me

Ja ne!
