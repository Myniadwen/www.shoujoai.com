<h1>Darkest Body, Brightest Soul (part 16 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../ggx/index.html">Guilty Gear X</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kaiser.html">Kaiser</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../ggx/bodysoul-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&#147;Hiya, Johnny.&#148;

Both Johnny and Dizzy turned to stare at May as she slowly entered 
through the door to the bedroom. May smiled bashfully with the love 
rose in her hand, and silently turned her gaze to the floor. This 
wasn&#146;t going to be easy. 

Dizzy was strangely silent, so Johnny was the first to address May&#146;s 
presence. &#147;What&#146;s up, May?&#148;

May blushed. &#147;Um...nothing...could...you leave me and Dizzy alone for 
a minute. We kinda needed to talk.&#148;

Johnny looked between Dizzy and May, and nodded accordingly. &#147;Sure.&#148;

Feeling that he was best not intruding on May and Dizzy&#146;s private 
time, Johnny heaved himself off the chair he was sitting on, and 
walked over to the door. Then just as his hand reached the doorknob, 
he remembered one last thing. 

Johnny looked back at Dizzy. &#147;Hey, Dizzy.&#148;

Dizzy herself was finding it hard to speak. &#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Me and June are going to check out a few things before we head out to 
this new restaurant that she keeps talking about. If you wanna come 
with us, then just give a knock on my door. I&#146;ll be waiting in my 
room, okay?&#148;

Dizzy nodded slowly. &#147;Okay.&#148;

&#147;Same goes for you, May.&#148; 

May smiled gently, and tried to hide her impatience. &#147;Um...okay?&#148;

With that said and done, the captain of the sky flyin&#146; May ship left 
Dizzy&#146;s room and made his way to his own. As soon as the door clicked 
shut, another cloud of thick tension surrounded the two girls. 

May couldn&#146;t stop admiring Dizzy&#146;s childlike and innocent beauty, and 
Dizzy could not stop herself from feeling some slight form of comfort. 
It had only been a few days ago since they were last alone together, 
but to Dizzy it had felt like...a lot longer.  

It was a missed feeling for the both of them. No matter how awkward 
the situation was, Dizzy just didn&#146;t feel complete without May in her 
life. And May simply couldn&#146;t get Dizzy out of her head. 

Dizzy was sitting rather timidly on the edge of her bed, while May 
slowly walked over to her, no words being spoken. The situation could 
be ruined. That was what May thought. She had decided shortly after 
her confession to June, that things would be handled a little better 
between she and Dizzy. Neither one of them had to suffer anymore. 

May took a seat next to Dizzy and drew in some breath. It was time. 

&#147;So...&#148; May started. &#147;How have you found China? Do...do you like it?&#148; 

Dizzy blushed a bit and looked downwards towards her feet. &#147;It...was 
nice. Mr...Johnny and I took care of the gold. I like China. It&#146;s very 
beautiful.&#148;

{Not half as beautiful as you are, Dizzy.} May sweatdropped when she 
realized how corny that sounded in her head. But yet she sighed as she 
felt how true it was. 

May really couldn&#146;t explain the feeling she felt as she gazed lovingly 
at Dizzy. The pirate girl fell victim to Dizzy&#146;s innocent charms. For 
the first time, May did not look at Dizzy as a Gear, or a pirate or a 
friend. She looked at her...for what she was. 

A woman. 

A graceful, charming, sweet, caring (and damn well sexy) woman. With 
silken sapphire hair framing her face, twin jewels of crimson tinted 
eyes acting as gateways to her soul, a delicately crafted body, so 
alluring she looked as though she had been sculpted by the gods. 

Dizzy was in effect, a blunt definition of a term we know as 
perfection. Dizzy was perfect. And for the very first time, May 
realized it. The pounding of her heart and the flames dancing along 
her cheeks was veritable proof of that. 

There was no mistaking the truth that existed within her soul. 

May was in love. 

&#147;...T-that&#146;s...nice,&#148; May was finding it hard to speak. &#147;I&#146;m...glad 
you&#146;re okay with...that.&#148;

Again, silence descended upon the two. Both pirates were finding it 
hard to express their thoughts on the situation. May just couldn&#146;t 
find the words for it, nor could Dizzy. But then May decided that this 
was the problem. She was a woman of action, not talk. And before the 
sun was out, she was gonna get her girl. 

May quickly presented the love rose to the one who truly owned her 
heart. &#147;I-I got this for you.&#148; 

Dizzy blushed slowly took the rose into her hand, and stared at it&#146;s 
rich petals and inhaled its sweet fragrance. &#147;It is lovely, May. Thank 
you. Where did you get this?&#148;

May scratched the back of her head and chuckled nervously. &#147;Oh that? 
April and me picked it up in Berlin. I just...I thought that you might 
like...it. It&#146;s okay, right...?&#148;

Dizzy nodded. She liked this. Not the rose by itself, but rather the 
way she and May could talk like this. And needless to say, May felt 
the exact same way. Slowly, May shifted closer to Dizzy on the bed, 
and clasped onto Dizzy&#146;s soft hand. Then May&#146;s dark ebony eyes glazed 
over as she felt herself drowning in Dizzy&#146;s twin scarlet crystals. 

May finally had the courage to face this. &#147;I...I missed you, Dizzy.&#148;

The Innocent Gear couldn&#146;t help but blush. &#147;I missed you too.&#148;

&#147;It...was wrong, what I did. I had no right to just run away like 
that. I&#146;m sorry if I hurt you. I was...confused I guess. You just 
shocked me and I didn&#146;t know how to act.&#148;

May took a pause and continued on. &#147;...You...really don&#146;t know how 
much you mean to me, Dizzy. You&#146;re my best friend...you always have 
been. Ever since I first met you...&#148;

Dizzy sighed as she felt May&#146;s delicate grip tightening around her 
hand. &#147;I...I need you, Dizzy.&#148;

May had to lighten the mood before a tear slipped out of her eye. 
&#147;Besides, it&#146;s been a nightmare without you around. Nobody else in the 
crew gets my jokes!&#148;

Dizzy giggled lightly. May always did have that amazing ability to 
console Dizzy and her cheer up. It was an ability that the brunette 
longed for the chance to use. 

May&#146;s hand released Dizzy&#146;s and travelled up to her delicate, pouting 
cheeks. &#147;You&#146;re still just so cute when you smile.&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s cheeks flushed. &#147;You compliment me too much...&#148;

&#147;But it&#146;s true.&#148; May said. &#147;I wouldn&#146;t say it if it wasn&#146;t true. 
You&#146;re so cute, Dizzy...&#148; 

Dizzy&#146;s eyes looked down. &#147;I wish...I could be more like you. You are 
so bright. You are not like me...I am...I-&#147;

The sapphire haired girl could only gasp in surprise as her soulful 
words were sharply cut off. Cut off as May forcefully pressed her 
velvet lips against Dizzy&#146;s. Then as quickly as her surprise arose it 
faded, Dizzy&#146;s eyelids closing slowly as May kissed her. 

Dizzy sighed helplessly with every second spent under the shade of 
May&#146;s desire. And the butterflies in her stomach made an unscheduled 
return. Finally she was in the arms of her one true love. 

Her May. 

Slowly, May disengaged from her impetuous lip lock, and gazed 
generously at the scarlet eyed goddess before her...

&#147;I love you, Dizzy.&#148;

Dizzy smiled brightly from hearing that. She had waited so long to her 
those words from May. Now Dizzy had finally heard them. And their 
caring warmth gave Dizzy a security of which she had never experienced 
before. 

&#147;May...&#148; Dizzy began. &#147;...I...&#148;

May put a finger to Dizzy&#146;s lips. &#147;None of that matters now. Just kiss 
me.&#148;

If that was her wish...The gap between Dizzy&#146;s lips and those of May&#146;s 
slowly disintegrated into nothingness, as their souls intertwined once 
again. 

Finally.

*********

&#147;Heh, heh, heh!&#148;

The huddled crowds of scientists smirked and mused over the fruits of 
their effort and hard work. They had done something that literally 
transcended the boundaries of rational science. Something that God 
himself could not have done. 

They had resurrected life. 

A living entity redelivered into this world via the magic of mankind, 
science. A creature that had plunged the world into total darkness, 
violence and bloodshed for a century. 

They had brought back Justice. 

As the other scientists ogled their work and discussed silently about 
this unheralded revelation, Justice&#146;s eyes finally began to focus on 
his surroundings. He was somewhere...in a laboratory. Inside a 
cryogenic test tube, with energy charged bonds clutching fiercely to 
his wrists and around his neck. 

Outside of the test tube, from what he could see, were around 20 human 
scientists in traditional white clothes. He had very little knowledge 
of his surroundings, but the place reeked of typical human stink. A 
stink that Justice had longed to be rid of. 

The King of Gears gave a tug at his restraints with a fierce pull, but 
it was to no avail. Whatever it was made of, these energy bonds were 
strong and had him in a very controlled position. 

Then memories of Justice&#146;s death came flooding back. His defeat at the 
hands of Type-00, the prototype, the only Gear to be fully sentient 
from his will. 

Sol Badguy. 

Justice knew that he had perished in that battle. He died just after 
he discovered the truth behind the identity of the &#145;Corrupted Flame&#146;. 
There was no way that he could be living amongst the air and trees 
once again.

Unless...

Suddenly the situation started to make sense to Justice. He was inside 
a test tube, in bondage, surrounded by herds of human scientists. 
These fools had...had actually brought him back...

Justice chuckled mentally at the paradoxical humor of the situation. 

{I was right about the human instinct all along.} He thought. 

Suddenly, one of the scientists walked up to Justice&#146;s test tube and 
crossed his arms in amusing contempt. Justice had the sinking 
suspicion that this man was the ringleader of this whole charade. 

&#147;Well, well, well. If it isn&#146;t the demonic, nightmarish demon who cost 
the whole world a cataclysm beyond belief. The commander in chief of 
the entire Gear army. The King of Gears...&#148;

Justice spoke out, but his voice was slightly muffled due to his 
containment inside that test tube. &#147;Who are you? Release me now!&#148; 

The scientist chuckled. &#147;Heh! You are in no position to be barking 
orders. I am the one who will decide your fate. I hold your life in 
the palm of my hand.&#148;

&#147;Fool!&#148; Justice bellowed. &#147;I am in full control of my own destiny! I 
am a being who autonomous from any human&#146;s will!&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t be so sure of that.&#148; The scientist said. &#147;You should be 
grateful. I have restored the life that was robbed from you nearly one 
whole year ago. Do you remember?&#148;

Justice thought about that. {A year?}

&#147;You see...a short while ago, I was robbed by three unknown 
assailants. They stole a rather valuable supply of gold that I had 
refined from some secret mines in South Africa. As you can imagine I 
was very...annoyed with this. So I decided that I needed to put some 
money in an investment that would prove to be...lucrative in the long 
run. And when these scientists offered me investment in a secret 
project...I jumped at the chance...to join the bandwagon. I funded and 
headed the Project that would bring you back into this world. Project 
J2, as it is known. But...as you can imagine...your revival comes at a 
price. From this moment forward...you will do my bidding!&#148;


Even though the scientist scathed that last comment, the King of Gears 
merely chortled at him. Not even Justice could believe how imprudent 
human will really was. 

The lead scientist didn&#146;t take that lying down. &#147;What&#146;s so funny?&#148;

&#147;You.&#148; Justice stated simply. &#147;I am laughing at how ridiculous you 
are. Do you honestly believe that I would bow down to a human after 
spending a hundred years locked in combat with your kind?&#148;

The lead scientist waved a finger at Justice. &#147;Ah! But you see, it&#146;s 
not that simple. We had a feeling that you would go against our 
wishes, so we added a little something which would...assure us of your 
undying loyalty.&#148; 

Justice&#146;s blood red eyes shined. &#147;And what might that be?&#148;

One of the younger, less experienced (and somewhat frightened) 
scientists moved forward to explain the situation to the Gear 
commander. 

&#147;Well...you see...&#148; The young scientist gulped. &#147;We added a small 
bullet-sized cartridge of liquid nitrogen inside your body. If...if 
you try to go against us...we can...freeze your internal biological 
components.&#148;

The lead scientist laughed. &#147;So you see, you have no choice but to 
follow my orders! You are about as helpless as a bomb collared Zepp 
slave! Ha, ha, ha!&#148;

Justice still couldn&#146;t believe this. {After all of the tireless 
battles they fought, they still had the audacity to bring me back into 
this world. What fools. The disease of humankind...they truly are 
unfit to rule the world.}

&#147;So what do you say, Justice?&#148; The scientist quipped. &#147;Will you follow 
or commands or must you be...liquidated?&#148;
 
&#147;Human...I must thank you.&#148; Justice said coolly. 

&#147;For what? For bringing you back?&#148;

The eyes of the King of Gears took a darker turn as he responded,

&#147;No...I must thank you...for reminding just how unworthy mankind 
really is.&#148;

In an instant, Justice ripped apart the energy bonds around his wrists 
with minimal effort. Then in a second motion, he thrust his talon-like 
hand into the reinforced glass tank, in one quick smash, the test tube 
smashed apart under sheer force of the attack. All of the other 
scientists then trembled in fear as Justice continued to brake free of 
his restraints. 

&#147;You brainless fool!&#148; The lead scientist screamed. &#147;We can kill you in 
an instant! You will follow my orders!&#148; 

Justice took no heed in this man&#146;s words, and smashed away the last 
traces of the test tube. The majority of the scientists in the lab ran 
for their lives. Only the lead man and his understudy stayed in place. 

The lead scientist looked over to his younger pupil. &#147;Quickly you 
fool! Insert the liquid nitrogen into his internal biological systems 
before he destroys anymore of my work!&#148;  

The younger scientist made a desperate scramble for a computer to the 
right of the lab, but before he could step even five paces, Justice&#146;s 
intuitive senses caught wind of it. Justice whipped his arm around his 
body, so fast that thin blue streak of nightmarish energy cut through 
the stinking air. That wave of sapphire energy sliced into the far 
computer with deadly accuracy, the units exploding instantaneously 
upon contact. 

The two last humans in the lab fell into a terrified silence, as 
Justice stepped out of the last shards of glass and liquid. 

Justice&#146;s voice was no longer muffled as he stepped forward to the two 
trembling scientists. &#147;You made one fatal mistake, human...&#148;

The King of Gears grabbed the lead scientist sharply by the neck, and 
with little to no effort, lifted him off the ground. &#147;And that 
mistake...was attempting to control life...because you see...&#148;

Justice pulled his fist into air to prepare to for a final attack. 

The lead scientist wriggled in Justice&#146;s grip. &#147;Please! No! I...I can 
give you money!&#148; 

Justice seethed with darkly amused anger when he added, &#147;Life always 
finds a way to break free...&#148;

**********

Jam sniffed in the sweet, sweet fragrance of her delectable culinary 
powers. The powers she was more than willing to exorcise if it meant 
catching her man...

Right now, the Chinese master chef was working a mile a minute over 
the oven in her kitchen, preparing the greatest meal she had ever 
cooked in her whole life. For one man, and only this man.

Ky Kiske. 

As long as Jam had breath in her lungs, she&#146;d find away to get into 
Ky&#146;s heart. He was really nice, but kinda naive. If Jam was going to 
get anywhere with him, she&#146;d have show Ky that she was the one. And 
the ring haired girl was going to start by preparing a sumptuous meal 
for her knight in waiting. 

After all, the way to a man&#146;s heart is through his stomach.

Jam stepped over to simmering pot on the stove, dipped a wooden spoon 
in delicately and tasted a small sample of the flavour. 

&#147;Hmm.&#148; Jam judged the taste. &#147;Needs a little more tare*. But this 
should be okay. Oh man, I really stuck my hand in this one. I know 
that Ky will love it...&#148;

2 hours later...
Ky took a seat on the medium sized dining table, and waited eagerly 
for Jam&#146;s meal. She had called him up a while ago and he couldn&#146;t help 
but be excited. After all, Jam&#146;s cooking was legendary throughout the 
world. Not to mention her strength. Jam was the great martial artist 
who took down the second self reliant Gear. 

{Miss Kuradoberi is so perfect!} Ky thought. {If only she could see me 
as something more than just an ex-soldier! If she could only see 
that...that I-}

Before Ky&#146;s thoughts escaped him, Jam slowly sauntered into the dining 
room, with a plate of freshly cooked Japanese-style Yakitori* in one 
hand, and a bottle of sake in the other. 

&#147;Hey there, Ky.&#148; Jam said sweetly. &#147;I&#146;m glad you could come.&#148;  

Instantly Ky stood from his seat and gracefully nodded to heed Jam&#146;s 
acknowledgement. &#147;I am delighted that you invited me to your home, 
miss Kuradoberi! Please, let me relieve you of those plates!&#148;

Jam winked at Ky as she placed her masterly crafted meal on the table. 
&#147;Oh it&#146;s okay, sweetie. You just sit back and try my cooking. I just 
hope that you&#146;ll like it...&#148;

Ky firmly held his hand to his chest. &#147;I am sure I will like anything 
you cook, miss Kuradoberi. Nobody on the face of this earth can rival 
the power you hold in the kitchen.&#148; 

Jam blushed and waved Ky off. &#147;Oh you flatterer, I&#146;m not that good. My 
multi-chain of restaurants across the world aren&#146;t that great either. 
You just try my Yakitori and see what you think.&#148; 

Ky was prepared to defend Jam&#146;s culinary skills, but took a seat 
anyway. He would first sample her brilliant cooking. Taking a long 
fork into his hand, (Jam ran out of chopsticks) Ky partook of Jam&#146;s 
meal. 

Jam looked on in expectancy as Ky&#146;s neutral face chewed on the 
Yakitori leisurely. &#147;Is it okay? Oh no...it&#146;s bad isn&#146;t it? I&#146;m sorry, 
Ky. I tried...&#148;

With a final munch, Ky swallowed it down. And what was his reaction? 

&#147;Whooooooooo!!!!!&#148; Ky yelled happily. &#147;My taste buds have died and 
gone to heaven!&#148;  

Jam beamed as her food was so well received. &#147;Oh you like it? I&#146;m so 
glad. Did you really like it?&#148;

Ky quickly stood upright, and gently held Jam by the arm, his eyes 
piercing into her own with a strong devotion and an equally endless 
passion. &#147;It was perfect. Only one thing would taste more 
wonderful...&#148;

Jam saw stars as she gazed into Ky&#146;s crystal blue eyes. &#147;I&#146;m willing 
to cook anything you want, Ky...&#148;

Ky grinned devilishly and pulled Jam closer to him. &#147;That one 
thing...is the taste of your sweet lips...&#148;

Jam giggled playfully as Ky&#146;s lips descended on her own. &#147;Oh Ky...&#148;


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147;Huh...wha...wha?&#148; 

Slowly, Jam faded back into reality from her couch-induced sleep. 
Adjusting her eyes a bit, Jam pulled herself up and yawned out loud. 
Then she sighed with memories of that beautiful, hauntingly perfect 
dream. 

{Ahh...man, I should have known it was only a dream. I&#146;d never run out 
of chopsticks...oh well. I&#146;m still cooking for Ky, so...Oh damn!} 

Jam cursed under her breath when the scent of burning chicken attacked 
her nostrils. And a black cloud slowly formed from the kitchen to 
accompany it. 

Jam&#146;s eyebrow twitched. Things were just not going her way...

**********

The smell.

That musky smell. 

That musky smell...of death. 

Surrounded by icy Gear foetuses...clouds wrenching in the sky. On top 
of those hundred steps leading toward the gates of heaven...

There knelt the great commander of the Gear forces. The sentient Gear 
that demanded the destruction of all mankind. The omnipotent creature 
that brought a reckless nightmare to the earth and all of its 
inhabitants. 

The King of Gears known as Justice. 

Kneeling on the dusty floor, beneath the victor of the fight. The 
victor that was called Sol Badguy.  As Justice knelt on the floor, he 
let his mind wander to acclimate his thoughts. The sash that covers 
Sol&#146;s forehead had been ripped off in their battle. And it 
revealed...the symbol. The symbol that Justice knew as the mark of the 
Gears. 

&#147;It&#146;s the same...&#148; Justice mumbled weakly. &#147;The same as that time, 
long ago...Once again I kneel prostrate at you feet, Corrupted Flame!&#148;

Sol looked away. &#147;Right...I won&#146;t stop until all the Gears have been 
wiped out.&#148;

Justice still could not be anymore confused as he stared at Sol&#146;s 
sash, lying broken beneath his hand. &#147;Why? You are a Gear as well! You 
have the emblem on your head! The mark on your forehead is proof! Then 
how did you disobey my orders?

Sol chuckled ironically. &#147;Why? I ask you the same question. Why should 
I do what you command? What binds me to you?&#148;

Justice sneered. &#147;I am Type-01...The first Gear ever produced. The 
only Gear to be fully self-aware...to have a will of their own! 
Because of that, I wield the power to command all other Gears!&#148;

&#147;My word is law!&#148; Justice bellowed.  

&#147;Every Gear manufactured after you, the first,&#148; Sol started. &#147;...Is a 
production model. They can do nothing but obey you. So, then, why do 
you think I don&#146;t follow you like a mindless doll?&#148;

&#147;Exactly!&#148; Justice could not hold back his curious rage. &#147;Why? HOW can 
you disobey!?&#148;

Sol sighed. &#147;Isn&#146;t it obvious? I&#146;m the prototype Gear.&#148;

&#147;...!!&#148; That simple statement smashed into Justice&#146;s mind. Now it all 
made sense. Now he knew how Sol could claim autonomy from his will...

&#147;Heh, heh...now I see...&#148;

Sol brought his animalistic hand vehemently into the air as his 
flowing locks of brown hair ran freely around his shoulders. The Gear 
inside was showing...

&#147;We were forged by the will of greedy human beings...and so, we are 
nothing more than a symbol of all that&#146;s wrong with the world. For 
that reason, I will never stop until I have destroyed every Gear.&#148;

Justice chuckled as his last breaths were leaving him. &#147;...So that&#146;s 
why...I seem to recall the G...Gear project...long, long ago...!?... 
That&#146;s right...heh, heh...h...how could I have forgotten you?&#148;
 
Justice&#146;s life force began slipping away as he added, &#147;If only we 
could have talked one last time...just the three of us...&#148;

And with a rattling chuckle, the Ultimate Gear breathed his last. 

Sol turned back to face Type-01&#146;s carcass. &#147;...Justice...?&#148; But Sol&#146;s 
concerns turned to a different agenda when Justice&#146;s final words sunk 
into his Gear brain...him...

&#147;That&#146;s right...the man who created us...&#148; Sol seethed. &#147;Our boss! I 
won&#146;t rest until you lie writhing in agony before me!!&#148;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sol recalled those faint memories with pinpoint accuracy. The day he 
killed Justice. Now...that raging Gear was loose in the world again. 
Thanks to the foolish ambitions of some idiotic human. Once again, Sol 
had to put an end to Justice&#146;s life.

Once again the Corrupted Flame had to enter the battlefield. 

{I know how he thinks.} Sol mused. {I know what he&#146;ll do next. He&#146;ll 
summon the Gears that are left in the world to his side. But...how 
will it effect the girl?}

Sol hadn&#146;t an answer to that question. But then he really didn&#146;t need 
one. The only logical thing to do was simple. Kill Justice. 

And as Sol walked along the gentle grassy countryside of China, his 
intent took over as he veered upon a new city...

{Justice...I&#146;ll take you to the grave with me!}

There was going to be one hell of a showdown in Fuzhou, China. 

**********

Kaiser&#146;s Afterthoughts
----------------------

* Whoo! Finally! May and Dizzy are finally hooked up! But so many 
things are happening at once. Sol reaching Fuzhou, Justice being 
revived. What will happen next? Wait for my next chapter to find out!

* There is a reason Ky wasn&#146;t in the Ky scenario (well, outside of 
Jam&#146;s dream) but I can&#146;t say, otherwise I&#146;ll spoil the scenario. And 
eh, if you&#146;re wondering where the Millia scenario is, I skipped it 
this chapter because it&#146;s nothing important. They were just travelling 
to Fuzhou. I dumped it this chapter because it really adds nothing to 
the story, but Millia and Baiken will be back next chapter.

* The flashback in the Sol Scenario was a ruff version of his GG1 
ending, if anybody is speculating about it.

* If you&#146;re reading this, then do me a favor and read my other story 
that I cooked up just recently, Marlene&#146;s Iron Maiden. I made a 
promise that if it gets more than ten reviews I&#146;ll continue it. But 
eh, I-No&#146;s in it so expect some bad language. 

* And before I forget, Suteki Da Ne is not mine, it&#146;s property of 
Square and Nobuo Uematsu, probably. But it suits Dizzy and May a whole 
lot better than it does Tidus and Yuna, don&#146;t you think? ^_^ 

* Oh and I was wondering. After I&#146;m finished with DB, BS (I only have 
about three chapters left) does anybody want to co-write a Guilty Gear 
fic with me? Nobody has to, but I always wondered what it would be 
like to do something like that. If anybody&#146;s up for it, just give me a 
bell, ya?
