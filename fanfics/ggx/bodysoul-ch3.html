---------------------------------------------------------------------

It had been two months since had Dizzy joined the Jellyfish pirates 
and become a part of Johnny&#146;s all female crew. At first, Dizzy had 
found it hard to settle into life on the May ship. It was just so much 
different from her previous experiences that it caught her off guard. 
Despite that May had helped to get Dizzy settled in and the two of 
them had become fast friends. 

However Dizzy could not help but feel a deepening closeness between 
she and May. It may not have been mutual, but Dizzy was becoming 
attached to May in a way that could not be considered to be just 
friendship. 

May on the other hand, was clueless. In her eyes, Dizzy was just a 
friend, and the only one that had a place in her heart was Johnny.

But things change...

**********   

Dizzy was back in her room, grooming her wings. It was one of those 
little traits that she had picked inside the grotto, and it had stuck 
with her. Normally she would take this time to reflect on the past, 
but lately, Dizzy had been thinking about nothing more than May.

A mild crimson blush rose unto Dizzy&#146;s cheeks the very second May&#146;s 
name came to mind. Dizzy knew how important May had become to her. 
Although Dizzy liked all of the crew, May was the only one that Dizzy 
felt genuinely comfortable with. No one could put her at ease or 
console her as well as May could. 

Even the fact that May was human seemed irrelevant. None of it 
mattered anymore. All that Dizzy cared about was getting even closer 
to May, and just maybe get her to look a little deeper.

As Dizzy finished grooming her wings, she dusted away the stray 
feathers and pulled out a book from under her bed. No matter what 
happened, Dizzy would always have a yearning for more knowledge.

A knock came at the door, as soon as Dizzy flipped open a few pages. 
Without looking back, Dizzy ushered them in. 

&#147;Come in.&#148; Dizzy said absently. 

The door opened up, and May walked in happily with a tray full of food 
in her hands. &#147;Morning Dizzy!&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s eyes widened in surprise, and a second blush came on her face. 
She didn&#146;t even have to look up to tell that was May. Dizzy put the 
book she was about to read down, and smiled bashfully at May.

&#147;Good morning, May. How are you today?&#148; Dizzy said timidly.

May grinned a toothy grin. &#147;I&#146;m fine, silly! But you didn&#146;t come down 
for breakfast, so I brought breakfast to you!&#148;

May brought the tray in her hands right up to Dizzy&#146;s nose, and Dizzy 
sweat-dropped at May&#146;s forthright nature. So very blunt.

&#147;Um...thank you...&#148;

May winked. &#147;No problem! But as soon as you finish eating, could you 
help me out with something?&#148;

Dizzy set the tray down on her lap, grabbed the fork and began to eat, 
just as May spoke to her. &#147;Certainly May, what do you need help with?&#148;

&#147;I just need some help with a few things and you&#146;re the only one I can 
trust with it.&#148; May said.

**********

Later on that day, after the morning break, May and Dizzy snuck back 
to May&#146;s room. It had to be done in secret, simply because they both 
had chores to do around the May ship, but April said that she&#146;d 
happily cover for the two of them. (As long as they paid her back for 
the effort) As soon as May got to her room, she dragged Dizzy inside 
and locked the door behind her. Dizzy was a little thrown by May&#146;s 
eagerness, but the young Gear had grown fond of May&#146;s impulsiveness. 
It was just another cute thing about her. 

&#147;Alright Dizzy, take a seat okay, I have something to show you.&#148; May 
said. 

Dizzy nodded and sat down on the wooden chair next to May&#146;s bed, while 
May started fishing around for something inside her wardrobe. 
Following a five-minute search, May wiped the sweat from her forehead 
and brandished the object of her efforts.

&#147;This is it!&#148; May yelled. It was a bright yellow dress, cut short and 
low, slightly revealing...

Dizzy sweat dropped. &#147;Um, is that a dress?&#148;

The face that May was making showed that she was at a loss to 
understand Dizzy&#146;s confusion. &#147;Yeah, something wrong?&#148;  

Dizzy didn&#146;t know very much about human garments, she had only known 
that there was a certain trend for the type of garment that you wore 
at any specific time. She had once heard this been called &#145;fashion&#146; 
but she had never taken too much stock in it. Until now. Dizzy didn&#146;t 
know much about fashion but she did know that this kind of dress was 
not standard form. It was sexual, in a very loud way. 

Dizzy tried not to think about how May looked in it. &#147;No. I like it.&#148;

May swelled with pride. &#147;Brilliant! I knew you would! I picked it out 
with April when we stopped off in the ruins of Switzerland. I just 
knew you&#146;d like it, Dizzy!&#148;

Dizzy nodded and rested her hands in her lap. &#147;It is beautiful. 
So...is this what you wanted from me?&#148; 

May nodded with a satiated smile. &#147;Yep! I just need you to tell me how 
I look in it.&#148;

Uh oh. That was what Dizzy didn&#146;t want. To see May in something so 
revealing and tight... &#147;Um...May, I do not think that I should...&#148; 

The minute May heard that she pouted at Dizzy with mock anger and 
placed the dress on her bed. May stood over Dizzy with her hands at 
her waist, and a look of disappointment painted on her face. 

The orphaned pirate didn&#146;t notice the flaming blush on Dizzy&#146;s cheeks 
but it didn&#146;t do any more good for Dizzy when May&#146;s cleavage flashed 
in her face.  

&#147;Why not? We&#146;re friends aren&#146;t we? Why shouldn&#146;t you see me in it?&#148; 
May asked. Dizzy was stumped by that. She actually did have a point, 
if you looked at it from May&#146;s perspective. 

Dizzy ran a hand through her hair, trying to avert her gaze from May&#146;s 
well-endowed body. &#147;...B-but why did you not ask April or one of the 
other girls?&#148;

&#147;Because April likes it too and I know that she&#146;ll try and pilfer it 
if I let her know where I hid it! And the other girls are all busy. 
Besides, nobody&#146;s a better judge of perfection then you are.&#148;

Dizzy was confused by that. &#147;What do you mean by that?&#148;

May leaned up properly, and held her hand to her chin, in a forced 
attempt to look wise. 

&#147;Well just look at you. You wear the same uniform as me; yet you seem 
so much cuter than I do in it. I think that there&#146;s something special 
about you. But that&#146;s just what I think.&#148;

Dizzy blushed again, and looked away with bashful smile. May always 
did that somehow. She made her feel so comfortable, even under a 
complement. Dizzy didn&#146;t like it when people harmonized her. It was 
embarrassing. Yet coming from May, it didn&#146;t feel embarrassing. It 
made her feel special.  

&#147;May...&#148;

The brunette winked at Dizzy. &#147;What? It&#146;s true!&#148;

The beautiful Gear exhaled and nodded to May. She may regret this, but 
if it made May happy...

&#147;Alright,&#148; Dizzy said. &#147;Model it for me.&#148; 

May giggled innocently and flashed a V for victory at Dizzy. &#147;Yeah! I 
knew you&#146;d come around! I&#146;m gonna get changed now so try not to peep, 
okay?&#148;

Dizzy&#146;s eyes couldn&#146;t get any wider then they did. &#147;What!?&#148; Dizzy 
spluttered. &#147;I would never do something like that!&#148;

May giggled again. &#147;Oh yeah? So why are you blushing?&#148; 

Dizzy covered her face with her hands to hide her flushed cheeks. She 
was damn well sure that one of these days that blush of hers would 
give Dizzy away. 

&#147;Stop teasing me!&#148; Dizzy said; her voice slightly muffled by the hands 
over her mouth. 

&#147;Hee, hee, hee! Okay, okay! Just tell me how I look in it.&#148;
May stifled her giggles enough to go behind the changing screen and 
get her clothes off. Dizzy looked to her side as May&#146;s silhouette 
stripped off it&#146;s clothing and flung them over the screen. Dizzy 
bravely ignored the outline of May&#146;s now nude form, no matter how hard 
it was. May gently fitted the yellow dress on, and smiled to herself. 
She knew that she liked it, but it was Dizzy&#146;s opinion that mattered. 
Yet May did not realize just how much it meant to her. 

May stepped around the screen and stood in front of Dizzy, arms placed 
at her sides, and her head bowed in a quiet inquisitiveness.

&#147;So...um...&#148; May started. &#147;How do I look? Do I look okay?&#148;

Dizzy just sat there, gaping at a flesh tight dress clinging to the 
object of her affections. It was hard to believe how good she looked 
in it if you couldn&#146;t actually see her in it. The dress gave her a 
mature, elegant look yet at the same time, May looked so completely 
sexy in it. 

&#147;You...look beautiful...&#148; Dizzy mumbled.

May&#146;s eyes flashed with a bright happiness. &#147;Really?&#148;

Dizzy nodded in earnest. &#147;Yes. You do. You look very beautiful.&#148; 

May did a little twirl and smiled happily at Dizzy. &#147;Thanks. I knew 
you&#146;d like it.&#148;

&#147;Why are you so adamant about knowing that it looks good on you?&#148; 

May&#146;s eyes lowered again, with another look a depth in them. 

&#147;Johnny. It&#146;s for Johnny.&#148; May said quietly.

&#147;Oh.&#148; Dizzy&#146;s expression promptly fell. That wasn&#146;t what she wanted to 
hear, not by a long shot. &#147;I see.&#148;

**********

It had been three months since Baiken and Millia had first met each 
other. At the time neither one of them thought that would end up 
living together but that had been the case. Millia had originally 
planned to keep moving, to avoid being caught by any rogue assassin 
agents. Baiken had been told of Millia&#146;s troubles with the Zato-ONE&#146;s 
assassin organization, so she held no reservations about Millia moving 
on. But there was a problem. The city ruins that Baiken had been 
protecting were in an alcove facing a high cliff face. It was more or 
less blocked off from the rest of the world, except for one checkpoint 
at the entrance to the city. There had apparently been had been some 
trouble around the outside of the city. So much so that the Union of 
Nations had declared Marshall law on the humble town, just until they 
could interrogate enough people within the city to substantiate their 
suspicions on their current suspects. That meant that Millia was 
pinned down to this spot for a while. She had at first refused 
Baiken&#146;s initial offer of a place to stay, but now that she was 
trapped here, Baiken&#146;s offer did not seem as outrageous. When Millia 
returned to Baiken&#146;s home and informed her of the situation, the 
one-eyed Ronin questioned Millia about it. She assumed that Millia 
could merely force her way through the checkpoint; her powers more 
than facilitated such a measure, but Millia argued that making that 
kind of trouble would blow her fragile cover. At the moment, this was 
the safest place for her, presuming the assassins found it as hard to 
get in as Millia found it to get out. So the scarred samurai and the 
unwilling assassin chose to live together for the time being. The 
checkpoint remained sealed until the Union of nations had sorted this 
problem out. It was supposed to be a short-term thing, but that 
short-term hold-off had generated into a long-term one. Nearly six 
weeks after the checkpoint had been closed off, and it was still in 
the thicket of its blockage. You would have thought that this would 
infuriate Millia to no end, but in actuality, she was not bothered 
about it. Millia had long since come to be attached to the city, and 
Baiken. 

It seemed like an unlikely pair, but Millia and Baiken had forged an 
unknowing friendship. Baiken acknowledged Millia&#146;s power, regardless 
of her restraint in using it, and Millia had become accustomed to 
Baiken&#146;s fire and spirit in the face of so much fighting and lust for 
vengeance. There was a mutual respect between the two of them. They 
respected each other&#146;s strength and could sympathise and relate to the 
suffering/pain that the other had been through. And as fate would have 
it, understandings on a spiritual level lead to understandings on a 
physical one. 

**********

One morning, around 9.00, Millia and Baiken travelled to a lake just a 
few miles south of the city to catch some fish. Millia had told Baiken 
that she had a dislike for red meat, and the only flesh-like food that 
could satiate her was fish. Baiken agreed that she would show Millia 
to the lake at which Baiken had caught her own. It was special for 
Millia, simply because she had never done her own fishing before. The 
two left Baiken&#146;s dwelling and brought some fishing poles, a blanket, 
a couple of bottles of sake (heh, heh!) and a bag to carry the spoils 
of their efforts back home. Millia and Baiken walked for about an 
hour, and eventually the reached the lake. The lake was beautiful, 
crystal clear water sparkling in the bright sunlight, and surrounded 
by a dank yet tranquil forest. 

Baiken and Millia stepped up to the embankment at the edge of the 
water. 

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful, isn&#146;t it?&#148; Baiken asked. 

Millia nodded. &#147;Yes. It is.&#148; Millia&#146;s eyes darkened. &#147;So strange that 
that this wondrous place could exist in such a war ravaged world.&#148;

The cerise haired samurai placed the two fishing rods and bottles of 
sake over her back on the ground and spread out the blanket over the 
slightly wet grass. 

&#147;We are lucky to have this. But this world cannot satisfy the needs of 
the few, like us. As much as I hate today&#146;s society for constantly 
indulging itself, I cannot blame them for it.&#148;  

Millia took a seat next to Baiken on the blanket that she had laid out 
for the two of them, and gave the Japanese woman a confused look. 

&#147;Why not? Humanity is as much to blame for the crusades as the Gears 
are. The Gears are the children born of the human race&#146;s arrogance and 
insecurities. Isn&#146;t it only fitting that the legacy of human warfare 
be the tool that attempted to author its destruction?&#148; 

Baiken chuckled lightly to herself. &#147;That&#146;s not a very pacified view. 
Humans cannot be blamed for human instincts. Fighting is a part of 
mankind&#146;s nature.&#148; 

&#147;That is just an excuse for those who can&#146;t face up to our 
bloodstained lineage. Fighting isn&#146;t something we&#146;re born with.&#148;

Baiken uncorked her bottle of sake, gulped some of it down in one 
swig, and smiled at Millia. 

&#147;You&#146;re right. Combat it isn&#146;t something that happens. It is something 
people make happen. Similar to a miracle. But if *they* are to blame, 
why are *we* still fighting?&#148;   

Millia&#146;s eyes darkened as she leaned back. &#147;I have no choice.&#148;

&#147;Everyone has a choice. You could walk away from Zato. He doesn&#146;t rule 
you any longer. Neither in practice nor in spirit. And trying to 
blindly fulfil a gift to a spectre of the past will not purge you.&#148; 

Millia breathed a sigh of frustration, and pulled a few strands of her 
unusual blonde hair back into place. 

&#147;I thought we were talking about the fighting of humanity.&#148; Millia 
said sharply.

Baiken let out a haughty laugh. &#147;We are. Or are you not human?&#148; 

Millia had to avoid that question. She herself didn&#146;t know anymore. 
&#147;Are you trying to find morality in warfare?&#148;

&#147;No, because there isn&#146;t any. What I am saying is that total 
destruction cannot be blamed solely on humanity. If fighting were not 
in the spirit of mankind, we wouldn&#146;t keep battling each other. You 
have power yet you choose not to exorcise it in a way that will cause 
you pain. That is a natural reaction to this situation Millia, but it 
doesn&#146;t mean that a fighting instinct does not live inside you. If I 
were wrong, you wouldn&#146;t have been able to defeat Zato-ONE.&#148;

The blonde shivered at the mention of that name. Images of him being 
consumed by shadows would echo in Millia&#146;s mind when Zato&#146;s name was 
spoken.

&#147;You seem to have a strong will to fight,&#148; Millia said grudgingly. &#147;Is 
this the result of your own instincts or because you feel something 
deeper?&#148; 

Baiken gulped some more sake. &#147;I am just a woman who enjoys a good 
fight. Aside from revenge it is the one good thing about existing in a 
soulless body. I choose to use my powers for my own ends, but not at 
the expense of the lives of others. Unless my sword demands it.&#148;

Baiken passed the bottle of sake over to Millia, who took it and 
guzzled a share. She wasn&#146;t a drinker but hanging around Baiken had 
that kind of effect of you. 

&#147;Is that why you didn&#146;t kill me when I asked you to?&#148; Millia said.

&#147;No. I just didn&#146;t want to see a powerful and gifted fighter die in a 
insincere and cowardly way.&#148; 

Millia closely studied Baiken, who was giving her an equally poignant 
look. The blonde had held firm on her ideas about fighting, but 
Baiken&#146;s way seemed to bring a light to it that Millia would never 
have found out for herself. When she first met Baiken, Millia was 
confused as to how she was so easily read by this woman. But within 
her was a sage-like wisdom. One that must have taken years to 
cultivate. You learned something everyday with this samurai.
